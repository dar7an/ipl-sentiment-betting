Copying my comment from other thread: Just read article on Cricbuzz that Chahar has ER of more than 8.6 vs Left hander, DC has 4 Left handers in their top 7 plus even Stoinis smashed him in last game, Jayant Yadav did well in that DC game, I wonder whether they will play him in Final.

Since then, MI have won 5 trophies including beating CSK in 3 finals and have now comprehensively surpassed CSK to be the most successful IPL team.",24

2020-11-10T19:42:13+00:00,MasonParker420,"Is it just me or did the last few games seem very monotonous, there was barely any intent even from the teams that were playing must win matches; there were no close matches at all; there was no hype like previous years while going into the playoffs; no on field rivalries in the semi final games. Maybe it was the bio bubble effect on the players mind which made them fatigue but at no point did we see a team that gave its all to win. I don’t know if this makes sense but normally the ending matches are so hyped compared to this year.",24
