2020-10-31T12:55:24+00:00,Uncomfortablekid,I think RCB should send shivam dube as 3 because usually rcb score 45 - 50 runs in powerplay  and lose a wicket but in the middle  over kholi nor ab take risks because after them the batting order is weak.. So the run rate in the middle over gets low. Shivam dube could be used a Sunil Narine. Just go out there and try to hit everything. If it works then it works otherwise he was anyway gonna do the same thing when he would come at 16 or 17 over... It's gamble but it could work well.. It worked in the indian team,1

2020-10-31T13:22:51+00:00,St_ElmosFire,"Okay so now we're down to a very few fixtures. 
Here's what the points table will look if the following results play out. It will make stuff really exciting and open until the very last fixture in the league stage.

1) SRH beats RCB [to keep the tournament open]

2) KXIP beats CSK [for KXIP to get to 14]

3) KKR vs RR (?) [It's simple. Win the match to stay alive. The winner too will then be involved in a tight NRR clash with others stuck at 14 points for the remaining two slots. Even then it's an uphill battle for the winner, because both KKR and RR have relatively poor runrates]

4) DC vs RCB (?) [One team can directly climb to #2 if they fetch 16. The winner will bypass the NRR drama entirely, and the loser will be thrown into the mix with the rest stuck at 14]

5) SRH beats MI [SRH climbs to 14, clashing with KXIP, RR/KKR, and DC/RCB, keeping the tournament wide open until the very final hour. Note: SRH have a superior runrate, they're likely to edge out all others on current NRR] 

Potential Final Points Table: 

MI 18

RCB 16/14

DC 16/14

KXIP 14

SRH 14

RR 14/12

KKR 14/12

CSK 10

This is perhaps the worst batting lineup they've had in a long long time. All those years they shat the bed, they were known to be a fearsome batting unit. This year they're anything but intimidating. 

TBF their batting ends at 4 and the only impact player in the entire batting unit is AB. Sure you can pull up Kohli and Paddikal's numbers this season, but how many games have they won this season? Or how many games have their innings had an impact on the game without AB not having to do his magic? One or maybe two, at best. 

Unless and until AB goes mad, I really can't see them even reaching the final. Even look at the previous game - Padikkal scored 70 odd, they were 90 odd in 10 overs but what's the use? AB failed and everything came crashing down.",8

His ability to hit big and long and his useful off-breaks, coupled with his fielding abilities - makes him an attractive package for any franchise.

You were fantastic till now and your spot at the top of the table is guaranteed. This has been a long tournament and most of your reserve players spent almost 3 months in the bio-bubble which took a toll on their mental health. It's only fair that they get a chance for the inconsequential game. Moreover, it is prudent to rest key players since the turnaround time between your last league match and Qualifier-1 is just 48 hours. So I suggest you field this team against SRH:

1. AnmolPreet Singh
2. Aditya Tare
3. Sourabh Tripathi
4. Prince Balwant Rai
5. Sherfane Rutherford
6. Ankul Roy
7. Mohsin Khan
8. Jayant Yadav

Tomorrow: 

1. KXIP to lose to CSK, even if last ball. They will be out.
2. We MUST win vs. RR, else we are out. Preferably win by a good margin to increase horrible NRR.

RR & KXIP officially out. Now we fight with (loser of tomorrow) & SRH for 4th spot.   

Monday:

1. DC vs. RCB, either to shit bed (likely DC given streak, but RCB can surprise), preferably by a good margin. 

Tuesday: 

1. SRH to lose to¬†MI really bad to bring down RR (whatever helps, helps us worst case scenario. Thanks a ton Mohammad Syringe u nasty rat). 

Outcome: 

1. We make top 4 likely to loser of RCB vs. SRH and if we beat RR healthily (tough but better we chase than they do because they're set very well chasing, no?). 
2. Would be great to see DC shit so hard they don't qualify after chilling in Top 3 for well over half the season. Would be absolute memes if RCB are knocked out. Win-win!",12

This is about Anjum Chopra. How the hell is she sitting up there in that commentary box?? 

Absolutely out of context commentary when she has nothing to say, adds no value, often states the obvious and makes obvious grammatical errors (Hint : ""Womens"").

To top it all, her voice is so damn irritating. She continues to blabber her nonsensical shit the entire match and makes the experience worse when your favourite team's loosing. 

Easily the worst commentator I've heard this IPL season. 

Spare us of your nonsense and go home, please, Mother Anjum",21

CSK v KXIP: CSK has to thrash KXIP considering DC's low NRR and horrible streak(upon which even Monday's game looks difficult due to the openers' struggle)

RR v KKR: Doesn't matter who wins, but the match has to be very very close so that their NRR doesn't change much.

DC v RCB: Now if DC wins this, idc about Tuesday's MI v SRH. But if we lose, MI has to THRASH TF OUT OF SRH for DC to make it.

Also, I think it'd be better to give Stoinis a chance to open, as there's nothing to lose anyway considering how terrible Shaw, Rahane and Dhawan(after the centuries) are performing.",10
