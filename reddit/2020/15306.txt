Out of the 6 wins we've had so far, one was from a super over and two were because our opponents (KXIP and CSK) shat the bed. We've only had 3 convincing wins.

It's been extremely frustrating following KKR this season, and I honestly don't understand some of the decisions made by the management. It eerily reminds of the 2009 season.

For instance, why would you field a team of only 5 batsmen against KXIP? We were 10/3 and our tail started at 4 down. It was painful to watch. 

And what was the thought process behind that 84/8? Honestly, I would have taken 60 all out if they'd shown a little more intent over that shitshow.

Today, why did you have to screw with the batting order again? We could have got another 10-15 runs easily. And why would you bowl Nitish Rana right after the timeout? CSK were under pressure and they rightly tore him apart. Regardless of how Locke bowled tonight, I think that was the turning point.
