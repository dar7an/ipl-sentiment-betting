2020-10-12T12:14:03+00:00,TheWatchfulGent,"According to KKR's social media accounts, Russell will play today. DK hinted that he might not bowl, so KKR will miss his death bowling.

On the other hand, Narine might be rested as 1. He will 100% get tonked in Sharjah, and 2. He was reported for a suspect action after the last match, so he might want to take some time off and work on it.

If Narine is rested, Chris Green might get a look in as KKR will play two spinners, or they could forgo that option and play Lockie Ferguson, which would be exciting as he will partner Cummins with the new ball.",1

I have been highly successful in life being cocky. It’s better than being under confident if you want my take on things.

Regarding DC, they should run away with the tournament but the management is really questionable at times so I doubt it. This is a better DC team for example:

Stoinis (Shaw is super unreliable) Dhawan Rahane Iyer Pant Hetmyer Axar Ashwin Nortje Rabada Ishant Sharma

I don’t see this team losing too many games despite Iyer who doesn’t use his strike bowlers before the match the over.

And also keeping in mind that hes been an international player for so long and almost plays the same bowlers in international cricket. And hes a regular in t20is also means that he plays on all sorts of pitches and conditions. Is it bcz he takes too much pressure on himself for performing in such a big league?,12

Rahane was more aggressive in 2011-2013 and played many such innings at the top as Padikkal is doing now.,6

Most sixes at Sharjah are above 75-80 metres but this is because batsmen are comfortable swinging because they don't get caught when they only hit the ball 65 metres. They're more likely to take risks because they know even a miscue is more likely than not to clear the ropes.

You still go with a fuckall bowling lineup ,with 1 spinner and then chase like that.",10
2020-10-12T17:54:13+00:00,sahasamane_cheppali,Guess even narine is better than Rana this season. He showed some intent when he was sent at 4 in one of the games. Dafuq is that guy Rana doing,10

Also guys like rana , gill need to watch their strike rates , it's not about just looking pretty at the crease in t20


Tripathi if in xi needs to open.

Karthik if in xi needs to come lower down the order to finish games.


Kkr is a decent side which can perform much better Morgan compared to karthik.",17
2020-10-12T18:00:29+00:00,sahasamane_cheppali,I agree Gill is talented and blah but that guy appeals more like a One day player than T20 player tbh. Initially I thought the same about Koach and kanos but they proved me wrong and they've adapted/modified or whatever and that's what makes them special. He doesn't have to change his techniques to go for big shots and I wish there was someone to groom him.,22
