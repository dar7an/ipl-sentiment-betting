If Indian can shed the conservative approach and get away from super star culture, the we can maximise the returns from these guys opening in ODIs till 2023.

KL, Mayank (Shaw/Gill as backup) for opening.

Move Rohit down to 3 and Kohli moves himself down to 4 (which he was already trying on occasions to fit in KL in the last year).

This will solve the No. 4 and middle order issues with Kohli holding the innings in the middle part of the game and helping the lower order explode (Pant, Pandya, Jadeja).

Thank Dhawan for his services so far but his time is up. He is struggling with long breaks and no active game time between ODI bilaterals. It's common for aging batsman who do not play all formats of the game to be out of practice.",6

RR- Shane Watson (A great all rounder, man has centuries and could take some amazing wickets, a perfect all rounder)

 Does the off side wide line move with the batsman ? Then it should move both ways. When batsman moves to off side..it goes beyond the marking on the pitch. So if the batsman moves towards leg side, it should move closer to the stumps.


The wide line is marked according to the position of the stumps, not the stance of batsman. It's not just about whether batsman could reach it.

So if a batsman stands outside the pitch on off-side..where would the wide line go ? Is the bowler bowling to take wickets or giving throw downs ?

Stumps don't move with the batsman.


This whole movement of line is very much like elusive ""spirit of the cricket"".",11
