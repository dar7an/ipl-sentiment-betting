2020-09-23T12:40:07+00:00,Ok-Dream-3424,"Is it just me or is the KKR batting getting overhyped? I think it‚Äôs decent but Russell is their only real champion batsman imo. They do have a decent Indian contingent in Rana, DK and Gill but except Russell they have no other consistent and reliable explosive batsmen unless you want to count Narine. Don‚Äôt see how the batting at DC or MI is not superior and maybe even a Punjab frankly. I guess the difference seems to be that many people rate DK and Morgan up there or near about the Warners and DeVilliers of the game, which IMO is not really valid. Morgan is good for sure but more of a Williamson/Smith mould player imo and then DK to me is decent but again a level down from a Rahul or even an Iyer.",1

Later Kkr can maybe send Narine as a pinch hitter when the leggie or left arm spinner is bowling. 

If narine opens its just a matter of time before his timber gets disarranged or he gets caught on a short ball.",1

They have enough batting strength to do well if he happens to get out cheaply with a few  overs left so there is no risk. I feel teams play too ridgedly with their big hitters who they have labeled as pure finishers in their head. Especially when they are in great form like he was last year.",3

Cummins plays 12 matches this ipl
He got payed about 16 crores
Let's say he got picked 75% for his bowling ability and 25% for his batting ability
16*0.75=12cr
That's 12/12 = 1cr for his bowling alone every match.
If he bowls 24 balls per match
100/24 ~ 4.15 lakhs per ball he bowls in the ipl.
That's 5550 USD per ball he bowls in the ipl

So he was paid 74.7 cr till now just so that concedes 49 runs in 3 overs.

Their Bowling has been awful last season and this season. They mustn't have sold Lynn. He was still a top 3 player of the team. Eoin Morgan really helps in Middle order but he isnt effective. He is just a batsman. It shows how much Gambhir's Captaincy held the team together. 

















Not gonna lie, but i see CSK in an almost same position in the next few years. Mi also shined under Rohit only. The more i think, the more i doubt that CSK will be as successful team as now. But if you give it a little more thought,you will realize that it's a cycle, a good captain wins the League once or twice(Depending on Balance of the team) during his span. Then if the team is able to find his sucessor and a balance in the team, they go on to win more. If not, they go through a period of being average untill they find their next captain.

2020-09-23T18:24:55+00:00,,"Cummins 6's didn't matter. He could have got out for 0 and the end result would have stayed the same.

What do you mean the NRR would have gone down even more ? NRR is for players who lack intent.",-11

You knew MI will be back with a vengeance after the last game, and knowing their record against KKR it was not difficult to predict KKR will be the victims of their backlash.",14

2020-09-23T18:42:52+00:00,Vaibhavr_7,"Only proves why Dhoni's point of not playing for a long time makes sense with this chase.Apart from Cummins (surprisingly),every player struggled with the bat early on,even Russell scoring 11 off 11 when 15 RPO is required speaks for itself.Also smart from CSK to protect NRR and not go for run chase after they knew their chance was gone,which is why probably losing by 16 looks better than losing by 3x of that.",-15

2020-09-23T21:31:31+00:00,BoreHoRahaHaiYaar,"Here's the thing: You cannot just score 30-40 in the powerplay when you're chasing around 200, that too on these typically slow and uneven pitches. That means you are asking your middle order/finishers to score typically at the rate of 13-14 for a considerable amount of overs, and start swinging from the get go which isn't easy and not really fair to them. You have to take advantage of the powerplay, even if it means losing a couple of wickets, & atleast score at the required rate or more, so that you have an adequate buffer in the middle part of the game when boundaries dry up, and your only source of runs are singles and doubles & the odd boundary, and finally setting up for your finishers to get 10-11 per over for the last 4. 

It's understandable if you're playing back in India on flat pitches and small boundaries, you can take your time since you know you can always cover up later, but the same isn't true for the current conditions.",42

He's very versatile with his position having been come down the order for KKR for a no. of years and then opening well for MI too. Strong on the leg, not bad through off side and unlike someone like Kedar Jadhav and Manish Pandey he has the ability for power hitting. The only problem being he's a bit on the older side but so are the previous two.",14
