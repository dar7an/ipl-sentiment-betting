Stoinis (Shaw is super unreliable)
Dhawan
Rahane
Iyer
Pant
Hetmyer
Axar
Ashwin
Nortje 
Rabada
Ishant Sharma

The closest one is the KKR Sharjah game and we even won that even though 3 sixes were hit off Rabada so that one was also over as far as I am concerned.

It’s actually astounding how bad these guys are at using Rabada lol.",12

Even yesterday, Dhoni bowled out Hazlewood and Chahar which was really the only way to win the match. I can never imagine Iyer and DC management bowling out Rabada in the first 10 as an example.",22

This dude is playing his first IPL and bowled against the Universe Boss. What else would you expect? Gayle targeted him as he was the weak link in the bowling line up and it paid off. Iyer should not have pointed him out.",38
2020-10-20T18:04:27+00:00,ddhenier,Thing with kxip is we’re a schrodinger’s team like someone said here. We’ll beat all the greats and then get a 10 wicket loss from thala XI,56

2020-10-20T18:07:26+00:00,ddhenier,The single biggest problem today with DC was that they didn’t target the easy bowlers. They were probably pinning all hopes on another death overs bungling but that didn’t happen because Shami,24
2020-10-20T18:07:42+00:00,revolution110,Kings 11 is a really good team. I think they deserve to be in top 4. I think SRH and CSK are the only poor teams this season.,41
