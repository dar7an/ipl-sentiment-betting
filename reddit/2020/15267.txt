2020-10-18T13:12:38+00:00,Noligation,"Let's Talk Rahul


448 runs in 336 balls at a strike rate of 133. Looks great!!

Rahul sans his 132 in 69 or so..

316 runs in 267 balls at a strike rate of 118.3


That's not good enough,  specially as he tends to bat til the end without ramping up. That's not good for either an opener or a finisher. 


 Gill is similar with 311 runs in 273 balls, striking at 114. 


What do you guys think about KL rahul's batting this far?  Slow or balanced?",4
