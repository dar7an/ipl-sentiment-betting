A team, or player, that can only win LOI matches/perform when the sun is up because the cricket ball does not undergo racism when juxtaposed with the void of inner darkness that consumes them at sundown 8PM. This reduction in internal guilt frees the player's mind to play better.

2020-10-03T14:02:40+00:00,navdak,"Why are so many people bothered about NRR, who cares for that after just 4 games? You play to win, you win enough games, you are through, I know that Indian team in 90s has made us think about NRR right from the start of a tournament because we always had to rely on it in the end to get to a Final, but still, NRR is irrelevant if you win enough games, and having won 3 out of 4, Kohli would be stupid to not back his team to win enough games for the playoffs",25

2020-10-03T15:38:31+00:00,,"If AB can keep throughout that this tournament without compromising on his batting, then RCB will have really strong lineup with one or two tweaks

I think this team will be perfect:

Paddikal, Finch, Kohli (c), AB (wk), Moeen, Dube, Morris, Sundar, Negi, Chahal, Saini 

Only major question mark on Negi but you can use Moeen and Dube to make up his overs it gets hit

But the batting lineup will have a good mix of power hitters and anchors and the bowling will have more variety. Batting up to 9 with 7 bowlers",2
