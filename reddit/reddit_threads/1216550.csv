I was at the ground when we lost by 146 runs. The humiliation over the second half of this season doesn't faze me. Today's inevitable loss will just be another page in the Delhi tragedy novel.

The DC team is simply not experienced enough to win games in crunch situations as it happened against MI, as far as batting is concerned. Neither are they led by a legendary player (like Shane Warne for RR 2008) . Plus SRH has such nice guys playing for them that I would not mind if they end up winning today against my first choice side. At least then the finals will be interesting to watch!",3

So I was seeing Kohli's Sun and Moon charts for this and the next year, and what surprised me is that the end of 2020 and the whole of 2021 is potentially supposed to be the best years of Kohli as a captain. There are extremely high chances of him winning a cup for his team, almost guaranteed you can say, which is rare to see in anything in astrology. However my guess is only one trophy, since I don't think his individual performances will be so great. But his captaincy is gonna be top notch and a lot of luck factor. Good news for Rcb fans/Indian fans. I would prefer the World t20 cup over IPL trophy though. 

Would want him to prove me wrong by performing really well as well 🤞",-5

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

Until 5-6 years ago, Indian fans, experts and media did all kinds of comparisons. We always said Rahane and Pujara are Dravid/Laxman 2.0 or  kohli is Tendulkar 2.0 Pandya is Kapilpaji 2.0 and things like that.




But we never forced them to be their clones. There were comparisons and metaphors but no forced adoption of their gameplay and strategies. 



And what's happening nowadays? We literally want every right handed Batsman to be a Kohli clone, every left handed to be a Yuvi clone and every WK to be a Dhoni clone. 


A right handed batsman is shitty unless he doesnt runs 3s, averages 52 and plays ""safe"" cricket; Just like Kohli does. 


A wicketkeeper is called shitty unless he keeps like Thala, breathes like Thala talks or sleeps like Thala. 



For God's sake let the Iyers, Samsons, Pants and Kishans bat like madmen who hit 3 sixes every over and dont waste their time and energy in stealing doubles.",17

Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I’m trying to quiet her down because I didn’t want her to bother Kane, but she wouldn’t stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Kane put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt.

Their fielding today was poor and on the back of that they didn't deserve to win. Great effort by KW and Samad to put up a fight but ultimately we lost hold of the match in the 1st innings.

Overall, I'm really happy with the effort and season SRH had. I only wonder how we would have fared if we weren't plagued by injuries.

Marsh, Bhuvi, Vijay Shankar (was doing well with the ball and just starting to find form with the bat), and Saha (gave us great starts with the bat). Ultimately it wasn't to be.

Boys can keep their heads up and I am looking forward to next season and hopefully we can stay fit and injury free.

-	sending Stoinis to open thereby allowing Dhawan to warm up without pressure to score
-	sending in hetmeyer instead of rahane 
-	Allowing rabada to bowl early in powerplay. Think he was bowling outside PP in last few matches. Rabada regains purple cap with 4 wickets and silence his critics by taking important wickets not the chump change ones
-	making stoinis bowl in powerplay. The lad is in good form. Only made sense to give him bowl early. And he delivered. 3 wickets in 3 overs. 
-	introduced a mystery spinner at the nth moment to surprise the opposition. Though it didn’t click. 
-	had a solid strategy (practiced well) against Rashid Khan. They were trying to play every ball. Think he went for more than 25 runs in 4 overs which would be one of his worst performances. 
-	played freely in powerplay. 60 plus in 6 overs and 100 plus in 10 overs. They will definitely attempt this again against mumbai. They just need to figure out a way to play their top quality bowlers 

Overall, lots of positives for Delhi. Let’s hope they play mumbai smartly too.",33

Rashid showed very good intent (like he always does) but fell to Rabada, no issues. What was Sandeep doing going so far down the legside leaving all three wickets? Sure 20 odd in the final over noone expects him to hit, noone is going to blame him, that's not his job. Not singling out Sandeep either, almost every specialist Indian bowler bats like this.  I'd have liked to see some 'swing for the fences' shots, and some spirit till the end. Even the running between wickets is so poor like 'I don't really care if I get out, this is not my job' lazy running. Is there some reason for this?",36
2020-11-08T19:05:31+00:00,ramukaka007,i can't believe the madlads actually did it. I was so used to this team being a bottom feeder i just hoped they could somehow make it to the qualifiers. The last two seasons have been amazing to watch as a delhi fan.,19

At last this team has reached the finals for the first time and boy ohh boy it's a wonderful feeling. I know the last and the most toughest hurdle awaits us now, but irrespective of the result I'm really proud of the boys. Thankyou Delhi Capitals, go out there, play your best and hopefully win the goddamn thing.",35

2020-11-09T07:01:01+00:00,,"I know we did alot better than we expected with our main players injured and we gave a good fight too. But a loss still hurts when we almost in the game till 23runs in 15 balls required and everything turned around. Our bois did well but hurts not to cross the line when we were this close. Arrghhh can't get over it.
