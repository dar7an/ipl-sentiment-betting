2020-10-14T12:17:17+00:00,AnantShrestthPajaMaN,Here's hoping we play the same line-up as we did against SRH but have Uthappa open and Stokes at 5. The pitch was slow yesterday so it probably will be today as well so Unadkat will benefit from that.,9
2020-10-14T12:21:56+00:00,wingzero00,"I want RR to win this year just because of Tewatia. But seriously the top order has to click sometime now, its been collapsing for 4-5 games in a row.",20
2020-10-14T12:32:59+00:00,shaun-tait-fanboy,Why does Vohra find himself out of the team? Royals have a potentially deep batting line up so surely they would prefer a dasher up top rather than an accumulator. Uthappa is a very decent backup accumulator imo but surely team dynamics dictate that Vohra is more suited to the role needed with smith taking over the accumulator's role?,3
2020-10-14T12:34:37+00:00,,"With pant out and hetmyer sacrificing for carey as the only wk option, DC batting is fucked. Too many accumulators at top 3 - dhawan, rahane,iyer. I think they need to play stoinis/carey up the order to avoid last match mistake.",2

2020-10-14T12:40:54+00:00,FrothierBog,"Ideally should have been an easy win, this pitch has also slowed down over the tournament which will let Dhawan and Carey really flourish here.

Iyer should come at 4/5 this time.

Stoinis, Axar, Harshal to finish.

2020-10-14T13:46:27+00:00,anirudh1595,"Here's the problem with DD's batting without Pant and Hetmyer: 

Dhawan - Accumulator who can't score quick 
Shaw  - Dasher who rarely bats long 

Rahane - Accumulator who can't score quick 

Iyer - Accumulator who can score quick, but often fails to make starts count 

Stoinis - Perfect fit; ideal finisher 

Carey - Not a great T20 finisher, can do a decent job nevertheless. 

Without Pant and Hetmyer, there's so much pressure on Stoinis to click. If he doesn't click, they might be hovering around the 160 mark game after game after game unless one of their Top 5 overperforms. IMO Iyer should ditch responsibility and go all out like he used to do a few seasons ago. There's no point in him playing anchor because there's already two guys above him who can do that. If Iyer also plays anchor, I'm afraid DC will struggle in most games to bat opponents out of the game.",2

* Dhawan batted really well today, dunno why he chose to play slow against Mumbai considering both innings came at a time when DD were in similar positions(had lost 2 wickets early) & also good captaincy at the end
* Our fielding is still poor, at some point this is gonna cost us not only extra runs, but possibly a match
* DC were still 15-20 runs short today too, like they were against MI. Scoring only 32 in last 5 could have costed them the game. Granted DC is playing without Pant & Hetmyer but really need to improve lower middle order
* All bowlers did really well today, especially Nortje & Ashwin. Axar too considering he went for 23 in his first 2, but came back strongly giving only 9 runs in his last 2 while also running out Parag(Thanks Uthappa).
* Rahane needs to be given another chance & shaw needs to sit down if Pant is unfit.
* DC's domestic bench is literally shit, if iyer & Pant are both unfit there's literally one option in the batting department for them & that's Lalit Yadav who's a batting allrounder who hasn't played a single IPL match",26
