So a tactical loss next game (against SRH) is what I would do to kick RR out.

It's easier to tackle RCB's bowling which is like a leaky faucet and also take care of an ageing ABD than deal with two players who are in their prime Butler/Stokes and add Samson and Smith to that. These 4 collectively pose more danger than an RCB or SRH batting lineups in playoffs. Add to that Archer who can wreck sides in couple of overs with a freak spell.

I as a normal cricket fan want RR in the playoffs than watching imbalanced sides like RCB or SRH. But if I'm part of MI management my priorities will be to see RR is out.

Before people go on a rant saying MI doesn't need to do that as they are great team, I know that MI is a complete team which is on a different level. So lay off on that.

Narine comes in - he is strong against spin and medium pace and weaker against extreme pace - RR bring extreme pace on - extreme pace used up before the death - Russell, Morgan and DK make merry in the death

Its not a bad line of thought, didn't work but with narine it's not too much of a risk - 11 overs left when he got out (66 balls) with Morgan, DK and Russell to come with tripathi still ther so even if he gets out its not delibitating - it's not like he pulled out a 10(15) innings",16

* Win against MI, KXIP and KKR in a row after winning 4 of 11.

* CSK beat KKR and KXIP

* KKR lose to KXIP(at that point NRR was not really in RR's favour)

* SRH to lose to one of their last 3 vs table toppers.

And it was the last one that seemed most likely. Also with some amazing bottling by DC and RCB, another option has opened up.",1

Do we even have any real big hitters anymore? 



* Naysayers and ""experts"" have successfully ruined Pant. 



* the moment his partner even sneezes, Rahul goes into the shell and his SR drops.



* Iyer hits spinners well but the moment they pull their length back, he struggles to hit them.



* We never know about Pandey. Some days he goes 50(30) some days he is  30(31). Also, dont forget the lack of variety in number of shots that he plays. 



* Rohit seems okay, he can hit out when reqd. 



* Kohli and Dhawan again, are some days hot some days cold. There are days when these 2 cant go wrong and then there are days when they can hit out of the circle to save their lives. Although time and again Kohli has shown he does eventually shifts gears after spending some time on the crease.

2020-11-01T18:03:20+00:00,shawman123,"Looking at Mavi/Nagarkoti, they have so much potential but they are no where near their peak in this tournament having come back from such a long layoff. With proper nurture and more play I could see them develop into really good bowlers. I dont know how KKR can retain both so there is a potential for other teams to look at signing one of them after next auction. 

Gill is another player who did not do enough considering his talent. He can look at how Padikkal or even Gaikwad late in the tournament applied themselves. Sometimes its not forcing shots but try to hit the ball in the sweet spot and pick gaps. I hope he continues to improve his game. He has ginormous potential and I cant see KKR not retain him. They could go for Morgan, Varun, Narine and look at Gill/Rana through RTM. Could be risky as these young kids will get big bidding. 

Russell needs to work on his fitness. Considering he is 32, I am not sure its worth keeping him. His fitness is not going to get better. But he is a hard player to replace. But this season was beyond mediocre. 

Eoin Morgan is class. I would definitely hold on to him. DK also did well in patches. I think he will find a good team(I hope its CSK) after next auction. 

&#x200B;

From RR perspective, its something similar to KXIP, when they were good they were really good. Stokes, Butler, Samson and of course Jofra Archer are excellent core. I am not sure they will keep Smith but he is not old and so I expect him to play for some team. Tewatia is really useful considering how well he bowls and his ability to tonk around. Gopal is also very useful. They probably need young Indian batsman or 2. I wish Smith had given longer rope to Yashaswi. That was a missed opportunity.",14
