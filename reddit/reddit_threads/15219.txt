2. The requirement for credit cards in India is basically non-existent given how most Indian cards already work everywhere (as opposed to many European debit cards which are useless online because they don't have a card number or CVV), so the volume demand isn't there either.   
 
3. Somehow the app rewards you for doing something you could do without them for free and no additional effort, or even lesser effort if you include downloading and registering for this...    

4. They have enough money to not only sponsor the IPL but also have extensive campaigns interrupting the innings.  

Am I missing something here? This looks like a very expensive marketing exercise propped up by weird VC money with a promise of future profitability and nothing else.

KKR- Nitish Rana, Siddesh Lad
RCB- Chahal
CSK- Rayudu
RR- Shreyas Gopal
KXIP- Jagadeesha Suchith
DC - Rahane and Dhawan (I'm not entirely sure about this one)
I might have missed out some but you get the point. It's a very balanced squad and at most maybe lack a spinner but the pace attack kind of makes up for it.",4
