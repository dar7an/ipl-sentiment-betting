The first game we needed a Stoinis miracle & KXI bottling the game to pull us out of certain defeat.

Second one we dropped the ball whilst batting in the death overs, but excellent bowling won us the game.

Hopefully we see our batters in some explosive form today.

2020-09-29T13:21:00+00:00,thepokemonchef,"Unpopular opinion as always but Rashid Khan‚Äôs spot needs to be looked at closely. He‚Äôs cost the franchise 9 Crores and an overseas spot. For someone costing that much money and keeping out Kane Williamson, he needs to perform head and shoulders above the other spinners in the competition. It‚Äôs not enough that he simply bowls at 6.5 RPO. Even average spinners do that. He needs to be able to deliver for the team in the power play and even death, and be a strike bowler, similar to how Ashwin was for CSK back in 2011. 
 
Like Narine, he essentially provides no batting utility as he gets out to any remotely high quality bowling. Several analysts were looking for KKR to drop Narine. Why is Rashid any different?",3

My proposed Kings XI starting lineup

Rahul

Mayank

Mandeep

Pooran

Sarfaraz

Neesham

Gowtham

Bishnoi

Shami

Cottrell

Mujeeb


This is a rather deep batting lineup and the bowling becomes miles better. At this point I think Gowtham basically offers the same thing that maxi does (maxi is woefully out of form with the bat), but doesn't waste a slot meant for mujeeb. Death bowling is still a problem and if Cottrell doesn't fix up (I think he will) we can always play porel and maxi can come back for Gowtham. Thoughts?",-2

The role of the third umpire is to collect sufficient evidence to OVERTURN a decision - if there isn't bang obvious evidence, how can they do that?

EDIT:

1) ""There was an obvious deviation"" it can't have been that obvious or the umpire would've given it. Moreover, if that was purely the product of the glove, why would there be such a tiny murmur on ultraedge?

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.
