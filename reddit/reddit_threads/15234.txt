Chawla, Tahir, Sharma are all leggies. Thakur and Chahar, although their skills are not exactly similar, thrive in similar conditions. 

No good, big-hitting finishers and the fast bowlers who can add some bite to the attack (even more necessary, given lack of power batting options) can't get in the XI thanks to lack of squad balance.

15 out 22 squad members cover only three distinct roles.

I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Virat, but she just wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Virat put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.

This also explains his insane speed behind the stumps. He is already attracted to them in the first place, so he is able to execute stumpings at unbelievable speeds.

Much that once was is lost, for none now play who remember it. It began with the forging of the Champions League T20 trophy. It was given to Ashwin and McCullum, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 3 IPL trophies to the Dawyne lords, Smith and Bravo of Caribbean halls. And eight, eight finals were gifted to Vijay, who, above all else, desires DK's wife. But they were, all of them, deceived, for their leader was corrupted. In the land of Auld Madras, in the sweaty fires of Chepauk, the Dark Lord Srini Mama forged in secret a master captain, to control all others. And into this captain he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all of the world's cricket. One captain to rule them all.

2) \[Showerthought\]: We Indians don’t get interesting original ideas or want to take risk in professional life as we don’t smoke pot.

3) Can someone prepare a nice visualization for an interesting stat I just though about?

Number of times during the IPL

(A) Dhoni won the toss and elected to field in IPL; and

(B) Dhoni lost the loss and was made to field. Split by years.

Is it even possible to pull this from some data source easily?

&#x200B;

4) Think its a 4D chess move by CSK. They dont want ONLY Dhoni to look bad due to poor batting performance (slow run rate initially).

Today, except for Koach masterclass it wasn't a high scoring pitch and the RCB seamers bowled well, then we threw our openers out of pressure to accelerate. Happens sometime. 

2. we have acknowledged that Dhoni and middle order shows no intent. Dhoni showed intent today but got out early. Kedar has been replaced. 

3. Today MS acknowledged that you can't take too much time to settle in after a wicket and hopefully middle order shows some more intent next time. 

What CSK hasn't acknowledged is who is their strike bowler? Ngidi/Tahir/Hazlewood all are bench warmers. 

Ngidi on this track could have been lethal. Tahir was our star bowler for the last two seasons! Hazlewood is great early wicket taking option too. 

Now look, I get it these  oldies are not an in touch right now and we don't have great options and playoffs are unlikely after today, but I hope CSK will improve and won't finish in the bottom 2 at least.",32
