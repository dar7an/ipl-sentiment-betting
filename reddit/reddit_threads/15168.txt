Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet.

Nabi could've been a good addition in Indian conditions, but as I've explained somewhere in the sub, Nabi likes the ball coming onto his bat and plays very early. Sadly the pitch is getting slower. A couple of matches down the line, it'll get as slow as BSNL 2G on a hot Sunday afternoon. Who we need is, as many have pointed out before, Kane. To hold this brittle and inconsistent middle order together. You can't win the tournament betting on people like Fraud Pandey and 3D Shankar. They are memes by themselves already. Getting in someone like Samad who's a genuine leggie can add more dimension to our bowling as the 5th bowing option. Abhishek is already a good enough 6th bowling option along side 3D Shankar and if needed Kane can roll up his sleeves for a couple of overs of off spin. We've been brainwashed to think that Nabi gives us Team balance(he's a bit of hit and miss. A great finisher, but can't hold off a collapse). When actually, he weakens the batting line up even further.",32

Mitchell Marsh has a unfortunate history of getting injured and not sure whether management really didn't consider that while picking him during auctions.

SRH should have tried searching for some other fast bowlers instead of continuing with same set of bowlers. Except Bhuvi to some extent everyone else has been ordinary to say the least. Better to pick Khaleel in place of 
Sandeep. He atleast has some pace.

Picking Williamson will be still very tough task as SRH really don't have a top class Indian all-rounder to replace any of the foreign all rounders. Based on the ground either Fabien or Nabi should be picked in next match.

Abhishek Sharma has been with this team for couple of seasons. Looks decent with bat. I believe he should be promoted at no 4 with other young players like Priyank, Samad, Virat Singh getting rotated.

Overall I believe they could have done a much better job in auctions by picking up some top scorers in domestic circuit rather than completely going for young talent.",28
