Just seems a waste given Stoin’s success opening the batting in the BBL to not give him a chance at the top of the order in the IPL. Also given the fact he’s played a bit of cricket leading up to the tournament, it might take the pressure of some of the others to adjust to the pace of high-quality cricket again.

Delhi could then take advantage and work the left-right hand combination down the order adjusting to the situation. With Stoin and Dhawan, the game could be over very quickly but with the safety net of class and power through the rest of the order if they don’t fire. 

Again, not trying to take anything away from Shaw…love watching him play and a cracking opener. Just seems this could be a trump card for the Capitals.",6

Simply not good enough, especially when you have Dhawan and Shaw (two 120-130 SR batsmen) as your openers. He needs to either a) learn to get off to flyers more often or b) Learn to cash in on starts and finish strongly. Right now he does neither. He generally hits a couple of sixes and gets out scoring 40 off 30 odd balls. Not good enough. Hope he changes that today.",8
