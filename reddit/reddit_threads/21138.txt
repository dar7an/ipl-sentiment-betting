Srh because it has a good team and Rcb because of potential individual performances from Abd/Kohli/Padikkal/Phillipe and Chahal or Sundar with bowling. Delhi neither has the team nor the individual superstars. For some reason batsmen are playing Nortje and Rabada much better now.",3

2020-11-06T16:26:36+00:00,CricketMatchBot,"**5.4** Mohammed Siraj to Warner, OUT, **appeal for catch behind as Warner is cramped.** Kohli reviews. Short of a length and into his body as he's skipping down leg side again. There is a sound as it goes through. AB lunges low to his right to cover the angle of Siraj being around the wicket. He didn't seem convinced. It's definitely got a part of Warner's body. But did it hit glove before that? **Early pictures on Ultra Edge suggest that it might have.** Disturbance as the ball goes past his glove. challenge for the umpire is to determine whether that's trouser or ball and he'll have to check purely on visuals for that. For gaps and light. The ball is right in between the glove's edge and where the abdomen guard would be. **'I can see the ball is touching the gloves here,'** he says. So that will be out. **43-2**

As an SRH fan, I hope Saha is fit for the next match against DC. The Warner wicket was a 50-50 call, so given my bias I would say it should have stayed not out. Nonetheless, the strategy of dropping Jonny (as tough as it was) to have both Kane and Jason in the middle order was the right call and it showed today.

That's the frustrating thing about Koach. He will never let any team coach have even half control and execute their plan. He always tries to heavily influence and decide team selections and get his favorite close rapport players in, try permutations combinations and messes up. 

His batting has been below par for past few seasons and his inner Koach instinct snd pressure vis causing all the trouble. It's a double whammy. 

He should simply handover captaincy to someone else and prove again that he still the feared batsman. He is still young and is super fit but his performances for RCB are fading away real quick. 

His stubborn nature and bad judgement of strategy is hurting the team a lot and also the mood in the senior players. He is one overworshipped control freak at RCB franchise. And it's clearly not been yielding results for 10 years now. 

I hope he steps down from captaincy, focuses on his batting and let some experienced bloke handle captaincy. 
It will do him and RCB real good.",11
