If SRH bats first, then we‚Äôre simply one Faf/Watson/Rayudu special away from losing. I think our batsmen can take on Bravo and Shardul bowling at the death. But I don‚Äôt think our bowlers can defend 30 off the last 2 if Faf and Jadeja are batting.",3

Clearly, if we lose too many, we are screwed anyway. If we lose today, might as well groom the bench for the next IPL from now on. Gaikwad, Santner, Sai Kishore for Watto, Jaddu and Karn.

Would be interesting to see if he plays next IPL. Right now it's not about his form but more about his fitness and being in touch with Cricket throughout the year. 

Other retired international players play in the various T20 leagues around the world so they are always practicing and playing. Dhoni is already retired and his inability to play in any other T20 league because of BCCI restrictions would again keep him from any action for quite some time. The only respite he can get that the next IPL is just few months away (Mar 2021) so won't be much of a big gap.

Just imagine being Kane.

You are removed from captaincy once Warner comes in. You are constantly moved across the lineup. You are constantly asked to carry the team to the Victory and yet you don't even get a decent support from any other batsmen and sone idiots would even blame you for taking risks when it is necessary. 

In the end SRH doesn't deserve Kane and deserves to be in the bottom half of the list.

Even top teams have a weaker fifth bowler. DC have Stoinis and 3 of RCB's 5 are 5th bowlers. It's the indecisiveness of the management and captain, that'll make us lose the tournament. Warner isn't the kind of captain that can make 5 specialist bowler trick work. Even someone like Kane failed with the 5 bowlers trick in the final third of that glorious 2018 season. The issue with our team is the inability to stick to a combination and taking too long to take hard decisions. (In the 2018 season, they waited until the end to drop Manish Pandey.

I mean the much famed Headlingly test match would have had a different result if the umpire was competent! But i would still blame Australia for the loss for not finishing that match earlier.",4
2020-10-13T18:33:49+00:00,,Do people care about Rashid's feelings anymore? He was so heartbroken when umpire reverted his decision! Such a painful sight on the cricket field. He might forget how to bowl the doosra after this. Worst thing ever happening to a young man üòî Dhoni please stop hurting ‚úãüõë,21
2020-10-13T18:38:47+00:00,exisiova,SRH would have qualified and won the title this year if not for the wide ball. Dhoni bad. IPL fixed. Umpires evil.,18

As an example, both these teams are finishing bottom 4 as far as i can see based on how they have played. But i expect downvotes to oblivion for saying that out loud.",-13

2020-10-13T19:40:53+00:00,RI3C,So Srh did a Csk against Csk today. Nice.,17
2020-10-13T19:45:47+00:00,mannojak,"Think natarajan should bowl 3 overs in the death i.e 16th 18th &20th overs while Rashid should bowl the 15th over.khaleel should bowl 17th and 19th.Losing Bhuvi screws up the flexibility in the pace attack,his death bowling is more difficult to replace.Sandeep is doing fine in the powerplay and should bowl 4 consecutive or the 4th one in the middle overs.
Shankar was actually brought in place of samad for his bowling,then today nadeem was picked ahead of abhishek,nadeem is a proper and decent bowler so there is no need of Shankar's bowling.Srh shud stick with samad who is a good hitter of the ball,he should be the finisher for srh,shankar batting that low coming in place of samad and not bowling makes no sense.

Warner 
Bairstow
Manish 
Williamson
Garg
Samad
Rashid
Nadeem
Sandeep
Natarajan
Khaleel
I guess this is the most balanced team for srh and even garg is not a power hitter so I think srh shud experiment with garg opening along with Warner and use Bairstow as a finisher.Warner shud play aggressively instead of anchoring",3
2020-10-13T21:09:01+00:00,St_ElmosFire,"Inside part of Dhoni's stare is made up of a death threat and outside part is covered by some intimidation, so all he had to do is look at the umpire and the umpire reverses his decision.. That's the secret why he getting decisions in his favour. BCCI won't check this bcoz BCCI=Ganguly=Srini=Dhoni so don't respect them. SRH will win. CSK injured Bhuvi but their daddy Nadeem is back, they can't threaten him with death to get injured like they did to Bhuvi after the last match.",21
