Bumrah had his first ever major injury and has been out of form since NZ. I think this is a strong sign because of his unconventional action and I hate to say it but I don't think he will sustain in the long-run. I'm sorry. Shami, on the other hand, will be able to sustain in the long-run and I believe that most of us can agree that he has actually been getting better and better ever since his injury.

Now I'm making this comparison because I'm looking at how they are both sustaining after their injuries. For Shami, it has been an upward trend in performance since his injury. For Bumrah, so far it has been a downward trend and I believe it will continue to be a downward trend unfortunately.

> 18.6 Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run 
Low full toss outside off, gets down and taps it to extra cover to keep strike for the final over  

> 18.5 Rabada to Agarwal, 2 runs  
Just clears extra cover. Low full toss at off stump, backs away and looks to open the face. Barely gets it over...looks like it's a run short though even though they're back for the second. Addendum: The short run was given for 18.3, but was registered by the commentator after this ball

> 18.4 Rabada to Agarwal, FOUR runs  
Iyer drops it at deep midwicket! Short ball into the body, a tired aerial pull. Floated to Iyer's left and he has the reverse cups up and almost no balance as this digs into the turf and lifts over the line

Compare that to Jordan's 83-ish SR at almost same situation and you have the difference between the 2 teams. U need to have an explosive tail for close matches like these.,34
