Buttler has done exceptionally well as an opener for RR and now as Smith seems to have found a new gear in T20s, management might have thought it might be wise to not fix what's not broken. 

More than Jaiswal, I would say they need someone like a Manan Vohra in the XI. Their middle-order is paper-thin and both Uthappa and Parag are not six hitters. They are too reliant on the Top 3 and cameos from the likes of Tewatia, as things stand.",6

2020-09-30T15:23:26+00:00,,"Some observations about IPL:

1) Rajasthan are by far the best dressed team. Hot pink and royal blue with white graphics, absolutely stunning fashion design here. I'm not man enough to wear pink, but I'd proudly wear their uniform

2) Staying with the sartorial analysis, Kolkata are the only team who pull off gold with even a shred of decency. Them aside, all the uniforms with gold on them look absolutely hideous. I point blank refuse to ever watch anything involving Mumbai, because I want to spare my eyes of the torture of that gold cringe

3) This is why you don't want to send Russell up the order. If he comes in at 6 or 7 with 4 or 5 overs to go, 24 (14) is a brilliant innings for that role. For a number 4 however you've got to stay out there for at least 20, 25 balls. Now I see the temptation, which is that if Russell faces that many he's going to have 60 to his name, but I don't think he's got the game to face that many balls on a consistent basis",15

Otherwise, it has been a perfect display of cricket from KKR on what doesn't look to be a 200+ pitch. Excellent stabilising from Gill and Rana at the top of the order followed by some good finishing from Morgan and Russel. And their bowling has been nothing short of top class, with both excellent economy and wicket taking. Not to mention the fielding - the catches have been senational and they've barely given away unnecessary extra runs in the field. Honestly aside from DK failing with the bat (and even then he had a good day with the gloves) this is the performance of a team who is hungry to win, and I like that. If RR don't make the playoffs I'd like to see KKR have a shot at winning, they have all the tools to do so: gun youths combined with experienced campaigners, a balanced batting lineup with both stabilisers and finishers. a bowling attack with a variety of options which can be tailored to the conditions, both probing pace bowlers and solid spinners.
