CSK batted first and went on to post 179 after being 7-1 after 4 overs.
Axar Patel getting Watto for the nth time.
Dhoni, Jadeja Carting Boult and Morris to all corners.
Delhi getting to 50 in quick time with Dhawan and Iyer in 5 overs. 
Then it was a procession with Tahir and Jadeja sharing 7 wickets in between them and getting all out for 99.
Iyer the lone batsmen with a 44.

CSK won the game by 80 runs and the NRR flipped and CSK got to positive and then ended up pushing DC to the eliminator all thanks to this one game!

KKR might have made way for RCB similarly here.",10
