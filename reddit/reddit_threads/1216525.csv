2020-10-17T14:00:31+00:00,beastranger_12,"As a CSK fan since inception and a Dhoni fan, I have never felt this much hate for him and this team. Supporting a team during  hard times is one thing but including Kedar again is not right on any levels. 

Not giving a decently performing youngster and giving a place to a player who didn't perform for two consecutive seasons is wrong on so many levels. I can even brush it aside.

But seeing him warming up beside Dhoni says much. It says that Dhoni is a person who likes sychophancy so much. The sight of that is getting on my nerves. No offense on Kedar though as any player has their losing streak. He won matches for India in the past but this shitfest is on the captain and the management. 

Captain cool makes me lose my cool. Seeing though the perspective of a neutral it wants me to spew hate for this one. Sorry for the long rant.",16

2. Fielders can't stop singles , making moderate catches look difficult.
3. Bowlers are less penetrative than before, lackluster fielding doesn't help either.

Overall a weak csk team , more reputation than performance.

Like the dude’s best is not match winning so why bother with him.",1

2020-10-17T18:11:07+00:00,sohompramanick,"Everything is going towards KKR's favour. In the past one week, KKR had two back-to-back huge failures, but they are still fixed at number 4 position. The supposed competitors have miraculously performed really poorly and won the matches - keeping KKR's position unchanged.

But KKR is not showing any intent to qualify, while other teams are pushing KKR to be at 4th position. I hope they take things seriously, and not take things for granted. Hope they sort things out and make a big comeback, because the team is really good - just the players are out of form and no single player has performed consistently till now. Fingers Crossed, hope for the best.",24

2020-10-17T18:16:29+00:00,shreytrehan,"I think csk just doesn’t have the team tbh this season. No proven batting backups and bowling being too overcrowded with leg spinners. Their ploy of making a team which suits the Chidambaram stadium and focus on winning those 7 games has backfired this time. Even if they drop Watson and Jadhav, they have Gaikwad and Jagadeesan who just don’t inspire confidence but tbh, they can’t be worse than what we are seeing rn. Get in hazelwood and Tahir, drop Watson and bravo. Remove karn Sharma, get in a batsman like jagadeesan and the team looks instantly better",12

I am not a MSD fan but i can definitely tell that he is a legend in cricket history.

This season CSK is not performing well as most of their players are past the 35 yrs, you can say that Dhoni didn't perform well this season but that does not mean he was a bad player, and what do they mean by ""hope this will open their eyes and Dhoni is fake""

Also the way these guys are behaving as a MI fan i hope they won't target us when we are underperforming cause MI have won the most IPL.",6

2020-10-17T18:25:24+00:00,User9333,Kkr will probably sneak in to the playoffs 4th spot and Russell will find form in that very game and RCB will get destroyed. I can see this happening if RCB don't get a top 2 spot.,15
