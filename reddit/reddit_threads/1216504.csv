Given that he’s captain and that KXIP are already playing a full time keeper in Pooran in their XI, I just imagined it would be easier of Rahul to communicate with his bowlers fielding elsewhere. So, is there a reason he is keeping this season?

I’ve thought about it a bunch the past couple of days and the only reasons I could think of is either 
a) he wants to show the Indian selectors he is a viable option for the white ball keeper’s spot, or

b) the selectors told him to keep wickets just to see if he could do it adequately
