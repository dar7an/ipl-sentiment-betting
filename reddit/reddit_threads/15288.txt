if u really want to buy an RO purifier first get ur water TDS levels checked (u can buy one for 200-300rs online).. only if TDS levels are 700+ RO purifier makes sense..
these RO purifiers brings the TDS level of input water usually by 90% !!
also lot of water is wasted, usually 1:2..

WHO recommends atleast 150 TDS so that water has essential minerals..

Municipality waters are usually pre treated and have 100-200 TDS... so a non RO purifier would suffice.. running them through RO purifier makes the TDS level 0.. which is not at all good..

So AB is Mr 360 right? But 360 means you're only hitting shots in one plane, or **2 dimensions** (some of you may now see where I'm going)

Therefore a 3D player such as Shankar, should be able to hit shots in all directions, at all elevations. 360x360 = 129,600 which is all the different degrees in a 3D space. But this would create a sphere of points, which the mathematicians among you may realise means that half the points would be underground in the context of a batsman in a cricket match, and even a god such as Vijay himself could not achieve that. So you do 129,600√∑2 = 64,800

Now it's also worth mentioning that quite a few of these points would basically be the equivalent of hitting the ball straight up in the air, making it likely to be caught, but they are still shots that a 3D player will be capable of nonetheless

I therefore suggest that we start referring to Vijay Shankar as Mr 64,800
