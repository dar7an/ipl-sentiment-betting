RCB vs CSK is where its at",103
2020-10-10T08:17:26+00:00,Noligation,"What's your opinion on the captains, KL or DK?


My respect for KL took a hit when he ran Mayank out. It feels like a shit Teton be in when captain is playing for himself. Most of the team looks demoralized AF. Not what the rest of the staff is doing.",8
2020-10-10T08:17:53+00:00,TyroshiSellsword,Gayle getting a chance today you reckon?,1

2020-10-10T08:51:41+00:00,_TheOtherBrownGuy,Russell & DK have been out of form. If KXIP manages to get out the top 4 they wont have to worry about their death bowling. Also if Gayle plays today what better team to make a comeback against \*2011 flashbacks\*,7
2020-10-10T08:52:22+00:00,BreakEvenPoint,Banton gets to do the challenge atleast.,3

2020-10-10T09:01:22+00:00,hornyh00ligan,"Things seem to be slowly falling in place for us. No idea how the fuck we won the last game but I'll take it. Tripathi needs to play well in order to not give the KKR management any dumb fucking ideas about making Narine open again. Our bowling attack has a lot of variety and depth, and is much improved compared to last year. Now, if only Russell finds an inkling of form with the bat, we'll be fucking unstoppable. 

Of course, now that I've said it, we're prolly gonna make a bunch of dumb fuck decisions and lose like 4 on the trot. Ah, being a KKR fan isn't easy.",9

It's better to have a team to support than being neutral/choosing random team, even if your team perform super shit. I'm supporting KXIP since 2008.

Cause of disgusting failure of KXIP:
-Shitty management. Didn't bid on any captain. Didn't bid on quality pacers. Fuck off.

-KL is a shit captain. Never saw him performing under pressure. Let him be a batsman/opener/wk whatever. He's definitely not a captain material. Doesn't even console his bowlers when they are getting pounded. He just stands there having ""oh shit"" expression. Da hell, man. 

-Kumble. Maybe, Kohli was right all along. They send Simran instead of Mandeep or Maxi, when you need runs against Narine. Seriously? I would make better decision here, when I was 16. Fuck off, Kumble.",25
