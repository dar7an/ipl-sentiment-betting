He wasn't in the team until he came in that ODI series against SL and smashed a 31 run over and then with his fine form walked into the WC squad. Everyone was critical of his selection but he ended up being thier MVP with fine knocks with the bat and pairing with Boult at the death. He had to bowl the most crucial 49th over against a settled Ben Stokes. BEN FUCKING STOKES. He dummied Stokes into getting a false shot that was supposed to the the WC for them only to watch Boult, NZ's best fielder mess it up and make it a six. He had to watch the last over while Boult bowled 4 pies to end the last over in a tie. Then had to come out and bat against Archer. Guy hit Jofra for a six in the super over . Do you guys realize how hard that is. He had to watch his teammate Guptill crying on his knees. He had to hear the news of his childhood coach passing away while he was hitting that six in the super over as well.

Then that Super over against England in the T20Is. 2 super over against Ind which he had to watch from home. Then he had to sit out in the IPL while his best buddy Maxwell jab and slice his way to run aball 20s.

Ffs, Guy deserves something for going through all of this.",13
