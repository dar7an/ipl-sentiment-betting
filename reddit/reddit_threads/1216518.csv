They need Pant back at 4 however; without him DC's relative scarcity of power hitting options looks worse. Having said that, Pant for Rahane is the only change they should make. Carey over Hetmyer addresses that lower order problem imo.

Mumbai simply look very strong. Anything can happen in knockouts but they seem to have all bases covered and even the bench is one of the strongest on the circuit right now.",6

First off, their game management is excellent. They bowled Rahul Chahar and Krunal Pandya out today because the spin was doing the trick. Meanwhile, we did not bowl out Axar. Similarly, I don’t really know who is responsible for it but you can’t have 4 overs of Rabada, Nortje left in this game with the game almost over barring a miracle. At one point, it was 26 needed of 24 with 3 overs of Rabada and Nortje left. That’s criminally bad management.

Also, Shaw can get you to the playoffs because he will perform in 1 out of 3 matches while others can save you in the rest. But he is a total liability for clutch matches: very likely to fail against quality bowling and a complete liability in the field. It’s a good time to phase him out of the team with 7 games to go but this probably won’t happen to be honest! 

No idea why we play Harshal Patel instead of Ishant Sharma. Yeah he can bat but we never really need his batting. 

Overall, I don’t see DC winning the competition till they sort out such deficiencies in management with the other teams who are at least similarly competent if not better.",11
