2020-10-04T18:00:41+00:00,FellowNineyrold9,So glad Faf and Watson duo is back!!!!!,7
2020-10-04T18:02:48+00:00,,Watson's back in form,4
2020-10-04T18:02:49+00:00,AtNand,Believe in the Lion!!,2
2020-10-04T18:03:01+00:00,,"Finally, it feels normal. And Watson comes back in form at the right time. Hopefully the tables turn for the better for CSK now.",14
2020-10-04T18:03:55+00:00,abhispot,"I understand that making change is not on cards and CSK trusts it's players but I still don't understand the inclusion of Kedhar Jadhav in the team. The guy doesn't bowl, isn't really a great fielder and has been consistently bad at batting. Don't remember a match winning innings from him either. Does his stats say otherwise or what is it?",20
2020-10-04T18:04:26+00:00,j_fedr,Jadhav is getting too much unnecessary hate imo. Sure they paid him much more than he deserves but he's actually a very good number 6/7 batsman and has played some really good innings for India.,1
2020-10-04T18:06:52+00:00,Hariii_,I hope CSK continues this form. They might have to win 7 out of the remaining 9 matches,15

2020-10-04T18:24:12+00:00,TheDceuGuy,Can someone point out why the fuck Faf isn't MoM?,15
2020-10-04T18:25:10+00:00,G_h_c,The INTENT is back,19
2020-10-04T18:41:39+00:00,Atharvious,"You have to see what's going on in Watson's mind from the start. The moment there's a spinner at one end, he takes a more leggish guard and attacks the bowler. He's not batting to just play himself in, he's batting to play some shots. I hope he continues on this performance.",14
2020-10-04T18:44:11+00:00,StupefyJin,So glad we don't have Chris Jordan as our overseas bowling option‚Ñ¢ anymore,13

2020-10-04T22:11:16+00:00,FireFistAce_10,I don't see any overseas getting replaced for csk but I also want Tahir to play,14
