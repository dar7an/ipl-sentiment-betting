2024-04-13T14:33:24+00:00,"The new stadium in Mullahpur (Mohali) is a prime example of how politics can ruin things. This new stadium is built by the camp that is opposed to PCA (Punjab Cricket Association), built with about 10k incremental seating capacity to the existing PCA stadium in Mohali, just a few kilometers away from each other, about an hour's drive from the team Hotel (which just kills momentum and energy for the home team) and quite away from the populated areas of Chandigarh, making it less accessible for the common man to watch and support PK team. 
A new stadium is definitely warranted in the state of Punjab, however I cannot understand why Amritsar city was not considered -  Decent population, more 'massy' population (Chandigarh is a city of elites - judges, lawyers, adminsitrators and hence the residents are less likely to go to stadiums), good flight connections domestically and internationally.",9

Why do we even need umpires when literally all dismissals can be more accurately judged using technology in this day and age? It's a game where a single wrong decision by umpire can potentially change the course of the match. In that case why not just delegate the job of deciding out/ not out entirely to technology. Umpires can remain on the ground just to ensure smooth conduct of the game. No umpires call drama, no leaning towards ""on field call"" when the third umpire doesn't have ""conclusive"" evidence to overturn. Just technology all the way through is better imo.",6

2024-04-13T17:59:29+00:00,after Manjarekar and Samson I wonder who'd be the next Sanju to do well at the domestic level but getting overshadowed with generational talents at the international level,4
2024-04-13T18:00:06+00:00,thing is they didn't give Arshdeep much opportunity as much as they give Siraj Arsh played 3-4 bilateral series and then no wonder why they didn't have him man was bowling good death at those matches I'd still wanted to have arshdeep instead of Siraj only if we had gave him more opportunity he would have turned out more smooth unlike siraj,2
