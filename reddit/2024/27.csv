A new stadium is definitely warranted in the state of Punjab, however I cannot understand why Amritsar city was not considered -  Decent population, more 'massy' population (Chandigarh is a city of elites - judges, lawyers, adminsitrators and hence the residents are less likely to go to stadiums), good flight connections domestically and internationally.",9

Why do we even need umpires when literally all dismissals can be more accurately judged using technology in this day and age? It's a game where a single wrong decision by umpire can potentially change the course of the match. In that case why not just delegate the job of deciding out/ not out entirely to technology. Umpires can remain on the ground just to ensure smooth conduct of the game. No umpires call drama, no leaning towards ""on field call"" when the third umpire doesn't have ""conclusive"" evidence to overturn. Just technology all the way through is better imo.",6

CSK managed to make Rahane a T20 player who's played a few swift innings. Tilak has been solid for MI. Abhishek Sharma is dynamite. 

I imagine if someone like Jitesh was in KKR or MI or something things might have been different for him. Look at Suryavanshi for instance.PBKS, RCB don't seem to have that environment.",8
