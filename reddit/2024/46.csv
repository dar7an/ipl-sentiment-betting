2024-04-28T13:19:53+00:00,zonedoutdriver,Let's go SRH,8
2024-04-28T13:23:24+00:00,Scoop_Master420,RCB deserve to be in the playoffs,-4
2024-04-28T13:23:53+00:00,kevinder_ant,"Well, that ended quickly. Now time to twiddle my thumbs and wait for the next game",6

2024-04-28T13:25:41+00:00,Nutella_S3npai,Tfw you wait nearly a week to see your team only for them to play like they've never held a bat or ball before,6
2024-04-28T13:27:06+00:00,StormWarriorX7,CSK are gonna bring in a spinner and it won't be Santner smh. Manifesting Phillips and Santner playing today.,7
2024-04-28T13:28:31+00:00,hooman_byeen,"Slightly shorter on one side but it shouldn't make much of a difference. Down the ground, the shots need to be well timed. It looks a bit dry. Some aberations here, traditionally teams that have batted first have succeeded but not this season. Spinners haven't had a significant part in this season either as has been the case previously. It looks very dry, there's a mosaic underlay and there isn't really a sheen that you have come to expect in this year's IPL. Same surface that was used in that game against GT where CSK scored over 200 runs. This pitch produces the greatest degree of turn, 2.4 degrees as compared 1,8 degrees compared to the other pitches. Still think there will be some assistance for the spinners and for those who can bowl slower delivers but there's still runs on the board. Might just want to have couple of extra overs of spin up your sleeve. There might be significant dew later in the evening"" say Anjum Chopra and Samuel Badree",3

2024-04-28T13:31:10+00:00,ConstantDurian7368,"Whoever bowls first has a great advantage , but if CSK are bowling first , then they are most probably winning the game.   
  
SRH are too reliant on Head and Klassen - if those 2 wickets fall a little early , then the score is not going above 200 or even 180. 

SRH's bowling is pretty good though and CSK are depending a lot on Dube. Can't expect him to hit every game , wont be surprised if he goes off early today , Gaikwad and Rahane need to step up their game , especially Rahane , he has to go crazy in that first 6 overs and don't care about his wicket - If Moeen Ali is playing , he can also play a quickfire innings. Don't see CSK winning (if they bat first) AND if they don't follow a certain plan to attack

If CSK bat second , none of these will matter as I think (controversial opinion) that CSK bowlers will get quick wickets and get them to a below 180-190 score , but still CSK may take it a little deeper than required.",4

SRH's hyper aggressive approach to batting means they're constantly gambling with either winning dominantly or risking a total top + upper middle order collapse. Cummins himself admitted this approach wouldn't always work. It might hold more weight in the groups but they're going to have to significantly tweak this style of play once they reach the knockouts, because I don't see them winning a title like this.

As for this match, I can only see a moment of individual brilliance from both or either Klaasen or Samad saving SRH.",8
