2024-04-14T15:27:50+00:00,Idk why CSK keep backing Daryl Mitchell? He's not a t20 player. Moeen Ali should play instead of him. He played so well for CSK in previous seasons and now he's just stuck on the bench,2
2024-04-14T15:27:50+00:00,Hardik might bowl another one instead of Madhwal tbh,1

Playing catch up (exception being when a team has lost a cluster of wicket) to end up with 80(48) after striking low for the first 30 delivers faced, will always after your teams upside score.

80(48) with a healthy strike rate throughout > 80(48) with a mediocre rate for the first 30 delivers.

1. Taking a regular bowler like Shreyas Gopal out of the attack after just 1 over and not letting him bowl more just cos of that one over. Having bits and pieces bowlers to cover for him. 


2. Not using your best bowler at the beginning of the innings.


3. Pandya's terrible line and length in the final over esp to Dhoni. Some of those balls that he launched into the orbit were gifts.


4. Overall being very rigid and not flexible enough to change plans according to the situation of the game.",17

2. Running the risk of getting discovered, changed roles and came down playing the anchor and saviour from collapses, wining it for the team with a calm head
3. Quit formats when they were not fit for him, didn’t hang around to be questioned about approach and strike rates 
4. Build CSK over years finishing games for them 
5. Stayed relevant by mind while he knew 5th/6th batting is not his place - comes around with minimum expectations, allows him to perform and gets back to strategising

2024-04-14T16:33:46+00:00,IMO the difference between Kohli and Brohit is that Kohli hits a few and goes over 150 but then immediately drops below 150 by taking singles. That approach is great in ODIs to not throw wicket but basically you will never ever see a higher than 150 SR. On the other Brohit has massive six hitting power. You know he can be 20 (16) and hit two sixes and be 32(18) which is over 170 SR. Plus Rohit doesn't check himself when he's striking. He doesn't have the need to run a single after hitting a boundary.,7

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin boner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",7

My gf recently left me cuz of my ED, I was on my regular urologist visit when I heard this 7yr old excitedly yell ""Ishaq kitchen"" while clapping hands, amused I also looked at the TV and suddenly..I felt a wave of joy running through my body, It was a cricketer named Ishan Kishan performing an inch perfect cover drive! I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin boner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",8

Rohit played like koach ,to make a hundred, he didn't even tried to play good shorts, bravo rohit you turned out to be no better than kohli.

The only thing I hate about Hardik as a captain is that he won’t take any responsibility 

The game changing over was his last over where he was absolutely smacked. Yet no mention in the post-match interview 
No appreciation of Rohit’s innings. He just doesn’t have the humility to earn the respect of his players as a captain. Neither does he perform in every match to command the respect.",42

Bowled dollies in the last over which ended up being the difference.

Promoted himself over David and didn't step up with the bat wasting precious balls.

He needs to go back to the drawing boards.",41

GT for backstabbing them.

MI for forcefully taking over the captaincy from a 5 time captain

Offloading test all-rounder Cameron Green to RCB. (Stupid team management themselves).

Add to the fact he is India's limited over vc, and now nobody wants him as captain once Rohit retires.",26

First of all, IPL performance shouldn't be used to draw conclusions about WT20 - pressure is different, and now with the impact rule even the dynamics are different

But okay, if you still have to - Rohit's innings isn't as concerning as Kohli, because Kohli slowed down in the middle and death overs, which are the same overs he is going to face for India. Whereas Rohit slowed down in the overs where he isn't gonna play for India. He just needs good pwoerplays, and he is doing that",-1
