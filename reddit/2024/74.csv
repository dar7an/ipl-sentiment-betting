Harshit starts smooching Cumdawg when he tries to silence him. Shreyas removes his jersey and starts showing off his Ramraj banyan. Varun stares into the souls of the audience. A wild Narine says, ‚ÄúI chuck, I chuck,‚Äù loudly. But wait, there‚Äôs more. A wild Neeraj Chopra approaches, removes his wig, and guess what, it‚Äôs Suyyash Sharma. Kingku goes on his knees and proposes to Suhana. The ground goes silent. A sad, tensed-up Kavya runs to the ground, stops the proposal, and is on her knees to propose to Kingku. SRK begs Kingku to reject her. Kavya says, ‚ÄúIf Kingku says yes, you can have the IPL trophy.‚Äù SRK rejects the offer, saying, ‚ÄúI only want Kingku.‚Äù GG says, ‚ÄúEk rejection ne aapko IPL trophy nhi dilayi hai.‚Äù Kingku says, ‚ÄúI want you, Shah Rukh. I thought Suhana was you in a wig.‚Äù But wait, Chandu cuts the sleeves of Kingku, revealing a new tattoo with the golden prophecy written on it: ‚ÄúTHALA FOR A REASON.‚Äù The whole ground starts chanting, ‚ÄúCSK! CSK!‚Äù Whistles echo.

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Starc. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

The iconic Eden Gardens erupted in jubilation as Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) clinched their third IPL title, defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in a nail-biting final on Sunday. Amidst deafening roars from the packed stands, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise etched¬†their¬†name in IPL folklore once again, adding another glorious chapter to¬†their¬†storied legacy.

While star performers like Venkatesh Iyer and Nitish Rana played their part, it was the unheralded Rinku Singh who truly stole the show. With KKR teetering at 89/5 in their pursuit of 174, the left-hander displayed nerves of steel, smashing an unbeaten 42 off just 28 deliveries to guide his team home.

For SRH, Pat Cummins led from the front, both with the ball and the bat. The Australian spearhead claimed three crucial wickets before contributing a blistering 33 off just 18 balls. However, his efforts ultimately fell short as KKR held their nerve in the closing stages.",9
