2024-05-26T13:02:59+00:00,"There will be  3 superovers today.

Harshit starts smooching Cumdawg when he tries to silence him. Shreyas removes his jersey and starts showing off his Ramraj banyan. Varun stares into the souls of the audience. A wild Narine says, “I chuck, I chuck,” loudly. But wait, there’s more. A wild Neeraj Chopra approaches, removes his wig, and guess what, it’s Suyyash Sharma. Kingku goes on his knees and proposes to Suhana. The ground goes silent. A sad, tensed-up Kavya runs to the ground, stops the proposal, and is on her knees to propose to Kingku. SRK begs Kingku to reject her. Kavya says, “If Kingku says yes, you can have the IPL trophy.” SRK rejects the offer, saying, “I only want Kingku.” GG says, “Ek rejection ne aapko IPL trophy nhi dilayi hai.” Kingku says, “I want you, Shah Rukh. I thought Suhana was you in a wig.” But wait, Chandu cuts the sleeves of Kingku, revealing a new tattoo with the golden prophecy written on it: “THALA FOR A REASON.” The whole ground starts chanting, “CSK! CSK!” Whistles echo. SRH and KKR teammates start having an orgy while Thala comes and takes away the trophy, saying, “Thala for a reason and Thala for another season.” In the end, Harshit Rana gets a ban for 7 seasons.",32

2024-05-26T14:08:53+00:00,"Just tuned in. 

Seems like another Indian opener faltered in a crunch game. One bad game I guess.",0
2024-05-26T14:08:53+00:00,"Maybe if Abhishek stepped out to counter the swing, that could've worked",0
2024-05-26T14:08:54+00:00,Did everyone forget how much it swings in Chennai?,3
2024-05-26T14:08:56+00:00,"That ball from Starc to Abhishek was similar to the one from Bret Lee to Unmukt Chand, the famous career ending delivery!",3
2024-05-26T14:08:56+00:00,"> Wanted to see Head vs Starc 🙄
It would have been Head instead of Abhishek🤣",3
2024-05-26T14:08:56+00:00,"Wtf I still can't get over that Starc ball, crazyy",9
2024-05-26T14:08:59+00:00,The ball that got Abhishek was way too good,7
2024-05-26T14:09:00+00:00,What Alyssa Healy being in the stadium does to a mofo,8
2024-05-26T14:09:02+00:00,"No matter how good stats record shami, bumrah have they will never reach starcs level",12

2024-05-26T14:09:05+00:00,That was unplayable as fuck,4
2024-05-26T14:09:05+00:00,"The ball is doing too much.
Session 1.
Overcast Conditions.
Just play it out.",7
2024-05-26T14:09:06+00:00,the ball of the tournament was Ishant to Russell,3
2024-05-26T14:09:06+00:00,"Head: Abishek, I have a very poor record against Starc. He always gets me bowled out. Can you take the strike?

Abishek: Say no more.",10
2024-05-26T14:09:07+00:00,nah fam what is this ?,8
2024-05-26T14:09:09+00:00,"Abhishek Sharma isn't the solution to India's knockout woes. Or for that matter, any youngster

If Australians bowl like this, it doesn't matter who is facing them",9
2024-05-26T14:09:10+00:00,Just stay till pp without losing any more wkts,6
2024-05-26T14:09:10+00:00,"Forget pace, even if it was spin that ball was unplayable, at pace you can just pray to god it misses off stump!",7
2024-05-26T14:09:13+00:00,KKR bowling is hell dangerous,8
2024-05-26T14:09:14+00:00,Hahaha Starc showing his WC form in the playoffs,4

2024-05-26T14:09:20+00:00,Really don't want a repeat of Q1. Rooting for a close game tonight whoever wins.,6
2024-05-26T14:09:20+00:00,You can't blame Abhishek for that one! Perhaps Fab 4 might be able to defend that one,4
2024-05-26T14:09:21+00:00,"No batter in world cricket, let alone T20s would have played that delivery without getting bowled. It was simply unplayable.",4
2024-05-26T14:09:21+00:00,I feel should have batted second. Final in T20 bat second is always better. Let's see.,5
2024-05-26T14:09:23+00:00,Has Scotty left already ? Haven't seen him in the insiders  in the insiders in the Knockouts,2
2024-05-26T14:09:24+00:00,Ball of the tournament indeed,9
2024-05-26T14:09:24+00:00,They should have bowled first lol,4

2024-05-26T14:09:26+00:00,Kkr looking like a hungy lion,6
2024-05-26T14:09:28+00:00,Very bad choice again with the bat first. You literally handed the most dangerous strike bowler the swingiest overs and will have your bowlers face a deadened up one.,3
2024-05-26T14:09:31+00:00,Just so happy to travel to home just to see the match. I have deployed my mother who is a champion reverse jinxer,2
2024-05-26T14:09:32+00:00,We want a 3  infront of our total lol,3

2024-05-26T14:09:35+00:00,Hyderabad doing more for the environment than GHMC,1
2024-05-26T14:09:36+00:00,Lmao KKR breathing fire,2
2024-05-26T14:09:37+00:00,Just show me that wicket for a whole hour it's just too good,5
2024-05-26T14:09:37+00:00,Was about to say that Starc performs better in clutch moments because Australia plays lots of nervy matches. But then I remember Rohit Sharma and then it's kind of embarrassing.,1
2024-05-26T14:09:38+00:00,Watching F1 and the match together and man what was that first lap of today's race 😭,3
2024-05-26T14:09:39+00:00,That wicket was purely due to the fear of Head's matchup against Starc. Abhishek ran the second so hard risking himself only to lose his wicket next ball. What a classy bowler Starc 🔥,9
2024-05-26T14:09:40+00:00,2018 repeatttt 😔!!,3
2024-05-26T14:09:40+00:00,Shake it well before use,4

2024-05-26T14:09:47+00:00,KKR playing like Aus of wc 23 final,8
2024-05-26T14:09:51+00:00,Good Abhishek not selected in ICT he is like smashing everyone when pressure is off but in last 3 matches when pressure is on he cracked under pressure,4
2024-05-26T14:09:54+00:00,"Barring that shock loss against Punjab, KKR has been MI 2020 level good this season",5

2024-05-26T14:09:56+00:00,Friendly reminder that Cricket Australia has a whole compilation of Starc dismissing Head on their YT channel,14
2024-05-26T14:09:57+00:00,Yup kkr is lifting this trophy for sure,6
2024-05-26T14:10:00+00:00,I agree with Watson there. No way Travis Head with his technique would've survived that ball by Starc,9
2024-05-26T14:10:00+00:00,"SRH bat first worked on roads, mostly right? Could have batted second to avoid extra pressure.",6
2024-05-26T14:10:01+00:00,Thank you IPL... Aussies gonna wreck us in the World Cup now!!!!!!!,4
2024-05-26T14:10:02+00:00,"with starc back in form, this Aussie T20 team is gonna be unplayable. breaching their mentality is gonna be difficult for ICT, now even losing the home advantage.",7
2024-05-26T14:10:02+00:00,Most of SRH batters are walking wickets. We need someone like Kohli or KL Rahul who can contain wicket even though they play slow,5
2024-05-26T14:10:05+00:00,Starc is going to fuck us in T20 😭,18
2024-05-26T14:10:09+00:00,"Well guys Im burning up so I'll take a tablet and sleep and see who wins in the morning, hope u all enjoy ur night 🫡",7

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Starc. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",8

The iconic Eden Gardens erupted in jubilation as Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) clinched their third IPL title, defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in a nail-biting final on Sunday. Amidst deafening roars from the packed stands, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise etched their name in IPL folklore once again, adding another glorious chapter to their storied legacy.

While star performers like Venkatesh Iyer and Nitish Rana played their part, it was the unheralded Rinku Singh who truly stole the show. With KKR teetering at 89/5 in their pursuit of 174, the left-hander displayed nerves of steel, smashing an unbeaten 42 off just 28 deliveries to guide his team home.

For SRH, Pat Cummins led from the front, both with the ball and the bat. The Australian spearhead claimed three crucial wickets before contributing a blistering 33 off just 18 balls. However, his efforts ultimately fell short as KKR held their nerve in the closing stages.",9

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Pat. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.

Also has probably the least delusional and social media aggressive fans despite their high success, fans who actually understand cricket. Their home ground is one of the most iconic grounds in the world.

1. KKR are absolute monsters when in form. No other team has such dominant runs.
