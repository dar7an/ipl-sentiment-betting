2024-05-09T16:38:50+00:00,Uselessguy0-0,"So when a player plays well, he deserves appreciation, and when he plays poorly, he deserves criticism. That's how commentary should work. But what's up with these individuals who want their hero to be appreciated all the time, and they abuse commentators for previous criticism, which was for that specific pathetic inning? Can't they accept that their hero was absolutely that day and move on? It's not like people are criticizing him even on his good innings. Just accept the criticism and move on. Don't come back at them and say, 'Fuck off' because their comment was about that one particular bad inning, that's it. They don't hate you. And the same goes for those obsessed with their heroes, trying to downgrade commentators every time that player does something great. It's the commentator's job to call out what's good and what's bad, which people don't understand. Then they'll whine about how pathetic and biased commentary exists. They don't understand they also play a role in that biased nature of commentary. The same goes for players; they have to accept they were bad that day. What do they expect, getting praised all the time? Then what about viewers? They are the primary reason commentary exists. And if you still don't want your hero to be criticized, then fuck off. Don't whine about biased commentary.

Really sorry for such a long comment but it's absolutely shit how fans behave and go after commentators and people they are the major reason commentator hesitate to give their honest opinion",4

But what's up with these individuals who want their hero to be appreciated all the time, and they abuse commentators for previous criticism, which was for that specific pathetic inning? Can't they accept that their hero was absolutely that day and move on? It's not like people are criticizing him even on his good innings. Just accept the criticism and move on. Don't come back at them and say, 'Fuck off' because their comment was about that one particular bad inning, that's it. They don't hate you. And the same goes for those obsessed with their heroes, trying to downgrade commentators every time that player does something great. It's the commentator's job to call out what's good and what's bad, which people don't understand. Then they'll whine about how pathetic and biased commentary exists. They don't understand they also play a role in that biased nature of commentary. The same goes for players; they have to accept they were bad that day. What do they expect, getting praised all the time? Then what about viewers? They are the primary reason commentary exists. And if you still don't want your hero to be criticized, then fuck off. Don't whine about biased commentary.

Really sorry for such a long comment but it's absolutely shit how fans behave and go after commentators and people they are the major reason commentator hesitate to give their honest opinion",9

Before last few years, man was speaking poetry about him in comms or in interview with the most popular one being ""Kohli while batting feels like he's almost lost in his own perfection"" in The Test. You could easily tell that he adored Virat from the start.

But now in recent years he has become more receptive to what's being said about cricket on social media, where intent, strike rate, weaknesses etc are discussed in more detail about all formats and with Kohli going through his slump in that time obviously there was lot of attention on him, some of the stuff spoken being valid but Kohli last year and this year especially is clearly working on his weaknesses but he still comments on him as if he has stayed the same as he was in his slump, going too harsh.",22
2024-05-09T18:48:09+00:00,confused_brown_dude,"It‚Äôs the little things (which are actually not so little to accomplish) that make Kohli great. For instance, he improvised insanely to bring in the sweep shots to counter the low SR against spinners. He has done the same for balls outside off back in the day. There are few players who can change their techniques or add to their repertoire as they establish themselves in cricket. There are even fewer who can do it within a few games or even seasons. But there are maybe only 2 or 3 ever( Sachin being the other obvious one), that can do it after playing for over a decade and a half. It‚Äôs absolutely awe inspiring and it boggles my mind where people compare him with ANYONE else in this generation.",30
