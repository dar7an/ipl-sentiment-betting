This knob probably came out thinking he'll silence the Gujarat crowd or something given how pompous he likes to act and instead got whacked all over. Not give a proven bowler like freaking Bumrah his rightful crack at opening the bowling?

If this is the bullshit he's going to pull as a skipper and the Mumbai management is going to enable this crap, the team's set for a shit campaign lol

And not really as invested in IPL as I used to be, but still root for my hometown. So this isn't coming from a place of hate lol",18

You can replace any of those overseas seamers with plenty of other overseas seamers from the past season.

Maphaka gets an IPL contract based on his U19 world cup, but Himanshu Chauhan carries Delhi's Ranji team on his back and I'm not even sure he has an IPL team?

All the overseas bowlers I mentioned are wonderful and talented and you don't blame the teams for playing them but how are India supposed to get quicks for their national team when bowlers like Mohit Sharma or Akash Madhwal get games over young bowlers with pace and bounce?

This competition incentivizes franchises to fill their overseas slots on x factor overseas bowlers and batters alongside whatever marquee Indian players they have and then pad the rest of the team with bits and pieces domestic cricketers for balance's sake.

No wonder all our T20I seam bowling picks look so pedestrian outside like Bumrah and a couple of others.",23
