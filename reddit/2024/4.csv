If RR go for Jos, Rovman, Hetty and Boult, opposition teams can take on the two Indian pacers. Best thing for RR is to play both Boult and Burger.

My XII would be Jos, Yashasvi, Sanju, Riyan, Jurel, Hetty, Shubham, Ashwin, Avesh, Boult, Burger, Chahal.",3

Some cited existing philosophical works such as Bordiga, Hegel and Plato.

The former saw Langer as the progenitor of a spontaneous revolution, his honesty being so elite it had deep ideological significance. They viewed his coaching as the cry of discontentedness with the neoliberal consensus, and a legitimate philosophical work in it’s own right.

The modern Hegelians saw Langerism as the dialectical synthesis between two states of being, that of anguish and that of ennui.

Those using the works of Plato are conflicted on whether to see Langer as a concrete object, real and tangible, while all consider the feelings the games elicit to be abstract.

Others saw him as post-modern performance art and tried to categorise him as the intended catalyst of a yet to materialise Neo-Fluxus movement.

Alas, others even ascribed him a theological value, arguing for the canonisation of Langer and compared our pain listening to his commentary to the pain our lord felt on the cross. A contingent of these worshippers split recently and alleged Langer was inherently heretical, no mortal man had ever suffered like Jesus did until we saw his LinkedIn profile.

The truth is, Langer defies what the human mind is capable of interpreting.

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of boys while my thoughts drift back to boult. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry.


Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.


One day one of us will die, and the other will bury the other outside the log cabin.

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Paddikal. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.

2024-03-24T12:37:36+00:00,,"As I walked back to the pavilion, tears streaming down my face, I couldn't help but feel that the game I love has been forever changed. The once proud tradition of the batsman valuing his wicket above all else has been abandoned in the modern era of T20 cricket.


Gone are the days of digging in and fighting for every run, of respecting the bowler and the game. Now it's all about swing for the fences and hope for the best. Wickets are nothing more than disposable assets, traded away for a few quick runs and a fleeting moment of glory.


As an LSG fan and a general fan of batting, it breaks my heart to see the importance of my wicket diminish before my eyes. It used to be that a batsman's value was measured by his ability to stay at the crease, to weather the storm and lead his team to victory. But now, it seems that all anyone cares about is how many sixes you can hit in a row.


Where is the skill in that? Where is the artistry? I fear that in this new world of cricket as a LSG fan , the true value of the game has been lost. We must return to our roots, to the fundamental principles of cricket, if we are to preserve the sport we love. The wicket must once again be held sacred, a symbol of our dedication to the game and the team.


Until that day comes, I will continue to fight for every run, to protect my wicket at all costs. For I know that while the game may have changed, the true spirit of cricket will always remain.",0

Run a ball 10s getting in to the game are one thing. Run a ball 30s are absorbing a quarter of the game.

He can start launching on a good day (maybe today?), but that bad day is facing 30 from 30 and then mishitting it to a fielder, and instead of needing 200 from 120 everyone else needs to hit 170 from 90.

Idk, he can fix this innings as he is, but you just can't be taking this long to start in big chases.
