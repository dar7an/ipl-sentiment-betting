2024-05-19T00:09:28+00:00,"26th May 2024, Chennai        


RCB have beaten their three biggest rivals - CSK, SRH and KKR - to reach the finals in what is their best chance ever to win the cup. 


But their greatest challenge is yet to come. In a stroke of genius, Shilpa Shetty has used her contacts at Big Brother UK to design a simulator to convince all RR players that a year has passed since the group stage matches and this is actually IPL 2025. With their newfound first-half-of-the-tournament form, Sanju and his men unleash a storm of boundaries at Chepauk to post the first 300 in the IPL.      


It's RCB's batting innings. The team can't believe they're somehow in the final after being 1-7 a few weeks back and are a bundle of nerves. Eight wickets fall one after the other in the first few overs even as Koach looks on shocked from the other end.     

Maxi is the next batter in. He is just about to sacrifice his wicket to a risky reverse sweep when he sees his disapproving in-laws' faces in the crowd. Not being brave enough to bear those looks of disapproval until his flight out of Chennai, he vows to post an unbeaten 100+ score in the match.     


But what's this? Kohli has gone into tuk-tuk mode. There's no way Maxi can score 301 on his own and realising this, people have started turning off theirJioCinema streams. Ambani will have none of it and quickly has every screen in the stadium show clips of Gambhir talking about Kohli. 


That's enough to recharge Kohli's batteries and activate his Super-Saiyan transformation fueled by the power of Delhi-boy anger.          Before you know it, RCB are 295/8 at 19.4. Just one six to end a 16-year wait...      

Kohli can already taste victory and as he is deciding on the number of flying kisses to pass on to the missus, he becomes too distracted. OUT!!


Faf now has a unique problem on his hands. DK, the only person yet to bat in the eleven, realised in the mid-innings break that his true calling was to raise the commentary standards in the IPL and is in the commentary box trading banter with the insiders. Every other person he could send as an impact player is already on their way to Bangalore for the celebration concert.     

With no choice left, he goes to Jay Shah and bribes him with some jalebi-fafda from Sowcarpet to make a last minute change to the Impact player rule...     


Sanju is tired of waiting for the last RCB batsman and is about to appeal for timed out, when the DJ starts playing a familiar song about a certain bird.     

The whole of Chepauk lets out a gasp as the first inter-team Impact player of the IPL walks in.       

Half his jersey is yellow and the other half red-blue. There's a logo of a dosa and filter coffee in the centre to represent the two cities he now represents.     

The last thing anyone hears before collectively orgasming to the helicopter shot are the words, ""I told you my last game would be in Chennai"".   ",105

If this game were to washout, it's no different to a washout if it happened during the first time that these two teams met.

20 for impact player and 20 for their margin.

2024-05-19T00:46:42+00:00,"Here is the thing. When a team is chasing let's say 210, it's difficult from outset even if they have good power play. Mainly because the chasing team has to SUSTAIN the hitting for 20 overs. But if there is rain inturruption leading to reduction in overs, it will benefit chasing team because they need to hit hard for lesser overs.

Last year's IPL final is the best example. If it was not for the reduction in over, there is a good chance that GT would've made comeback. Ofc  i'm biased as a GT fan but you can't deny that it was CSK's last batting pair and to score 50 odd runs more in half as much deliveries was gonna be difficult.

Keeping all this in mind, I'd say CSK are pretty much favourites.",2

Second innings - Rahane and rutu get out early to siraj, but the combination of rachin and ravindra prove to be too much for the hosts, and hence csk qualify.

For batting first, the minimum margin required is always 18 (mostly) or 19, based on the exact number of overs and the exact first innings score of RCB.

In case of 15 overs, if RCB scores <=93, required margin is 19, else 18.

In case of 10 overs, if RCB scores <=37, required margin is 19, else 18.

He takes strike. Faf, Kohli and Ferguson discuss something at the bowlers' mark. Ferguson loads up, the sea of red firmly behind him. Comes in at full pace, bowls 140+ bouncer right at the grill. MSD swivels and ruffles a ferocious hook.. it connects.. connects well.. connects too well.. the ball sails over the boundary and hits the roof of Chinnaswamy for a 101 m six.

RCB vs CSK 18th May(FULL match Script)

CSK bat first and score 123 in 20 overs, RCB comes to bat thinking it's an easy target, they start good with Kohli hitting two boundaries in the first over, RCB 10/0 after 1, then Deshpande comes to attack and suddenly Faf out, Maxwell out, patidar out, Deshpande has a hat-trick and RCB are 10/3. Kohli starts building a partnership with Mahipal Lomror, slowly RCB get to 78/3 in 14 overs, then Deshpande comes back into the attack, looks like he will attack, but no what is this, Kohli scores 36 off his over, RCB now at 114/3, they need only 10 more runs to qualify. Santner is supposed to bowl next over, but what are we seeing? Thala opens his pads, removes his helmet and starts taking bowling run up, and runs into the pitch, oh! and Lomror is out after scoring 33(45). Dk comes to bat next, the crowd is shouting DK is the real Thalal, DK is the real Thalal, but guess what Thala gets him out also, then thala gets four more wickets in that over, He got 6 wickets in 6 balls! all clean bowled, perfect Yorkers. He finishes the over and RCB is at 114/9, they still need 10 runs, CSK need 1. Thala looks at Kohli and goes, Apun ne Bumrah ko bowling sikyha tha. Then Kohli goes fuck this shit, I'm too horny right now, so he opens his pants and starts getting raw anal from thala in the middle of a packed chinnaswamy. Suddenly we see Jay Shah land from a helicopter and say what is happening? This wasn't in the script, but thala looks at him says ""look at the crowd, they like this more than your average cricket match"" shah says oh fuck yes they do, they have produced more cum than what I did after writing IPL 2023 scripts, so Jay Shah decides to change the name of IPL and makes it Indian Pornographic League and appoints thala and kohli as it's main ""milk suppliers"" so that the media can milk them as much as they want now. And then they all lived happily ever after.",1

_“Kohli scoring 47 at a strike rate of 165+ on a rampage Turner and these lockdown kids said he can't play spin He used to bash prime Ajmal, herath, mendis, Narine when you weren't even born”_

I checked the specific stats against each bowler and Kohli does not have a strike rate of more than 120 against any of them. (Faced 30+ balls) 

Kohli’s strike rate against each (in T20i) -
Mendis - 100
Ajmal - 110
Narine - 89.7
Herath - 122

He is a brilliant player but his strike rate against each is lower than what his career strike rate is",4

2024-05-19T03:22:26+00:00,"The year's 2056. CSK has been on a rough patch for years now. 3 consecutive wooden spoons and no playoff spots in the last 2 decades


Luck favored them this tournament. All they need is to secure one win against RCB to secure the playoff spot. Tough call, RCB are the defending champions after all this year. And the year prior.... Annnd the year prior 


The match starts out with CSK bowling. It appears their luck has run out. Six after six, the CSK bowlers face abuse at the hands of RCB. The pitch, too dry and flat


Over in the  CSK dressing room, the embalm-pickled cyborg-android body of Srini mama computes away, thinking, hoping for an avenue to break through in this match, something to get CSK across after 2 decades of drought


Minutes of tension. The robot-human stood still, leaving the CSK staff in suspense. 

Suddenly, its voice boomed. It appears the decision was made. ""Send HIM over on to the field. Our last resort"", echoed from it's cold, robotic body



The game grinds to a halt as the announcer rouses the crowd up. Silence echoes from their dressing room, as the crowd watches on


An old 70 year old in a wheelchair is carried onto the field by the CSK staff. The crowd's taken back by confusion. Confusion at first, but a closer glance revealed it was none other than Dhoni himself wheeled onto the field serving his team one last time



The audience in Chinnaswamy stadium collectively cum all at once at his sight once again , drowning the field in a thick malai flood of cum. The match has to be called off due to the resulting rain


The players walk back onto the crusty field after it'd sufficiently dried. Or so they thought. The ball had begun spinning, the collective cum of the entire audience still leaving the pitch moist


The ball turns and turns. Rcb's order fall like a pack of cards. What's that? They're all out? For 49?


Dhoni wheels himself onto the field for the second innings. 7 consecutive wides . 7 consecutive sixes.


CSK wins the match and qualifies for the playoffs. TFAR",4
2024-05-19T03:22:27+00:00,What bad times for CSK if your 20th over bowler is Thakur,5
2024-05-19T03:22:27+00:00,Shardul again? Man rutu is a braindead captain. How can simarjeet be any worse than this fraud? He has bowled fantastic the last few matches,2
2024-05-19T03:22:28+00:00,If the ball didn’t gripped for 5 overs after the rain it would have been a 260 score,7

Him and Parthiv really gave 5-8 year old me a ton of hope, and to see how they both reinvented and reestablished themselves after the astounding rise of MS, with their IPL titles, their return to the national team at times, their dedication to Ranji and the general dignity with which they carried themselves.",3

2024-05-19T03:23:00+00:00,"Great show by RCB, everyone chipping in. I can't help but think that Kohli's innings made sure they weren't depleted of all momentum during that phase where it turned square. 15 runs fewer may have meant they imploded under pressure, especially since Faf couldn't get it off the square",9
2024-05-19T03:23:04+00:00,Hoping Maxwell can get a few cramps here,0

RCB vs CSK 18th May(FULL match Script)

CSK bat first and score 123 in 20 overs, RCB comes to bat thinking it's an easy target, they start good with Kohli hitting two boundaries in the first over, RCB 10/0 after 1, then Deshpande comes to attack and suddenly Faf out, Maxwell out, patidar out, Deshpande has a hat-trick and RCB are 10/3. Kohli starts building a partnership with Mahipal Lomror, slowly RCB get to 78/3 in 14 overs, then Deshpande comes back into the attack, looks like he will attack, but no what is this, Kohli scores 36 off his over, RCB now at 114/3, they need only 10 more runs to qualify. Santner is supposed to bowl next over, but what are we seeing? Thala opens his pads, removes his helmet and starts taking bowling run up, and runs into the pitch, oh! and Lomror is out after scoring 33(45). Dk comes to bat next, the crowd is shouting DK is the real Thalal, DK is the real Thalal, but guess what Thala gets him out also, then thala gets four more wickets in that over, He got 6 wickets in 6 balls! all clean bowled, perfect Yorkers. He finishes the over and RCB is at 114/9, they still need 10 runs, CSK need 1. Thala looks at Kohli and goes, Apun ne Bumrah ko bowling sikyha tha. Then Kohli goes fuck this shit, I'm too horny right now, so he opens his pants and starts getting raw anal from thala in the middle of a packed chinnaswamy. Suddenly we see Jay Shah land from a helicopter and say what is happening? This wasn't in the script, but thala looks at him says ""look at the crowd, they like this more than your average cricket match"" shah says oh fuck yes they do, they have produced more cum than what I did after writing IPL 2023 scripts, so Jay Shah decides to change the name of IPL and makes it Indian Pornographic League and appoints thala and kohli as it's main ""milk suppliers"" so that the media can milk them as much as they want now.

2024-05-19T04:37:47+00:00,I think the plan is to bring the over confident dube by introducing spin. It’s brave and if it works. It might well be the match,1
2024-05-19T04:37:47+00:00," In rain-affected matches where the DLS method is used, it's indeed possible for the revised target to be higher than the total runs scored by the team batting second. This can happen when the team batting first scores quickly and loses few wickets early on. Here's why a losing team might have a better NRR in such cases:
 * Favorable batting conditions: The team batting first might have benefitted from good batting conditions (e.g., dry pitch, early innings) compared to the team batting second.
 * DL accounting for future wickets: The DLS method factors in the likelihood of future wickets falling for the team batting second. So, it might set a higher target anticipating more dismissals.
Therefore, the team batting second might have a better NRR despite losing, as their run rate according to NRR calculation considers the higher target they had to chase under adjusted conditions for rain.",0

He makes some sensible choices in one match, and makes some absolute stupid decisions the other. I mean how many times did he displace himself, Mitchell, Ravindra and to bring Rahane to open, and Jadeja at 4 and what not. Any time he went with what was an obvious choice, CSK won. Anytime he experimented they failed terribly. CSK could have and should have won more if they just got their batting order right in at least 2-3 matches. Gaikwad stuck with his XI and backed players in the usual CSK way but he messed up quite often by chopping and changing the batting order and player roles, that's what eventually came back to bite them.",9

This match had absolutely everything:

•	⁠Slow Start & Rain making it impossible to bat

•	⁠Openers Grit & Kohli controlling the game first half

•	⁠Most Unfortunate run-outs - Faf & Rachin

•	⁠RCB going ballistic with Faf, Patidar, Green & Maxi

•	⁠Golden duck by CSK captain & Dube in Shambles

•	⁠Rachin, Rahane, Maxi Redemption

•	⁠Kohli sledging anything that moves

•	⁠Flying Faf’s miraculous catch

•	⁠Dhoni 110M six

•	⁠Swapnil’s ice veins catch similar to Sreesanth ‘07

•	⁠The greatest Redemption of all time - Yash went to delivering 5 balls conceding 1, after getting hit for 5 consecutive sixes last year.

All this with RCB having less than 1% chance to qualify a month ago and winning 6 back to back on the trott, going against all odds, other teams losing, winning with a margin of 18. My Heartbeat stayed up from the first over of this game and it never came down for a second.

The lifeless bowling, a couple of our main batsmen getting out during the beginning of the innings and being miles away from the other team was so similar to what happens to the Indian team.

2024-05-19T06:46:38+00:00,EL CAUVERICO - RCB vs CSK 🔥,25
2024-05-19T06:49:33+00:00,"Oh hell naw, going by the pattern CSK is winning again next year 💀

Also it would be funny if RCB get knocked out after 6 W in a row against RR who would be coming after 5 L in a row.",9
2024-05-19T06:54:28+00:00,Shardul is now just a shadow of who he used to be. He leaks too many runs which he used to earlier too but earlier he used to take crucial wickets ,7
2024-05-19T06:57:43+00:00,I'm still soaking in everything. It was unreal. It was surreal. It was unbelievable.,17

2024-05-19T07:17:29+00:00,"Oh man the news outside Chinnaswamy is not good. Apparently hooligans are attacking people with CSK jerseys outside the stadium. I just hope everyone stays safe.

Edit: One of my female friends had a similar experience outside the stadium. Abuses were thrown and the drunk hooligans even tried to physically attack some people. Absolute shitshow rn. What are the police even doing???",14
2024-05-19T07:18:09+00:00,"This match truly feels like we are into the new ages of IPL and Cricket now. Absolute blockbuster entertainment, 11/10 value for time and money. Players played with their everything. Every single ball felt like a penalty shootout in a FIFA World Cup final.",37
2024-05-19T07:21:42+00:00,The loss to GT was a pivotal one. Should have won that easily or at least not lost that badly.,3
2024-05-19T07:24:07+00:00,"What a complete, complete performance. Other than Lomror and Karn, everyone contributed.

Faf had blood on his hands initially but made sure to utilize the time taken by him. Good captaincy, giving those overs to Maxwell was a masterstroke, and that amazing catch, aye aye skip.

Virat, oh my fucking Virat... Where was this version of yours in all these IPLs??? I don't have any words to express my feelings for this guy, but please make sure to continue this in the playoffs.

Goatidar, my starboy, although I expected some more spin bashing from him tonight, 41(22) is a job well done.

Cameron Green, you motherfucking giant. Those strikes towards the death were killing blows. Set a platform for DK and Maxi to go all guns blazing. Amazing, amazing innings. His best of the season.

DK DKed as usual.

Maxxiiiiiiiii finally arrived. Oh boy, I forgive your shithousery for the entire season. 16(5) and 4-0-25-1 was a clutch god performance. Surely he is my pick for the player of the match, without any doubt.

Swapnil was very handy with those two silent overs. It was the right call from Faf to discontinue him when Dube and Rachin/Jadeja were there, but that's a job absolutely well done from Swapnil.

Siraj was hot and cold throughout the match, but that 15th over was crucial in the context of the game. Overall, 4-0-35-1 are decent figures in pursuit of defending 201.

Ferguson absolutely shat the bed in his last two overs in which he gave 37 runs, but his first over in which he gave 2 runs and picked a wicket was very crucial in the context of the game. It was kind of a game-changing over.

And last but not least, Yash motherfucking Dayal. I'm sure nobody is going to ""Players after going to RCB"" now, but just remember the memes when he got picked by RCB. For a change, he did something which bowlers forgot to do to Dhoni, which is, bowling a good ball. I hope his Rinku Singh ghosts go to rest now.

We have given lots of complete performances in these last 6 games where everyone did their part and not just one or two players, but I don't think we've seen this level of complete team performance in a long, long time. There is no clear match-winner for this game and yet we won this pretty comfortably in the end. Proud of this team. Proud of the unreal comeback.",53

2024-05-19T07:46:01+00:00,"Was watching the highlights, one thing I loved about Rachin is how he put up his hand in apology as soon as he was dismissed. We rarely see this happen in cricket. 

Usually, out of the frustration of getting dismissed, the dismissed batter often blames the other batter in the heat of the moment. This was nice to see.",33
2024-05-19T07:47:40+00:00,34.8k holy shit. This game was absolutely worth the hype,30

what a match it was.

Agent Faf and Agent Karn vs Agent Dube",11

2024-05-19T08:06:55+00:00,The fact that a fandom is not celebrating RCB’s achievement here and happy about CSK’s loss says something about them,-39
2024-05-19T08:09:42+00:00,"Proper team effort from RCB. From Kohli making sure the run rate didn't falter after the rain, Patidar - Green maintaining the run rate, DK and Maxi having great cameos and Dayal with that brilliant last over. This team felt like a band of misfits at the start of the tournament and it's really amazing to see how far they have come.",29
2024-05-19T08:15:31+00:00,I was celebrating just like Kohli too 😭❤️,16
2024-05-19T08:25:01+00:00,"Maxwell has the same number of wickets as Karn this season, and he's going 3 runs per over less than Karn. Surely it makes sense to include an extra batter in place of Karn right?",12

2024-05-19T09:07:43+00:00,Kohli’s Celebrations for each wicket lit up the crowd and eventually build pressure on CSK. Dhoni last over six… out of the park. Cherry on top for an Indian fan.,28

Was eliminated by SRH, KKR, RR

It would be absolute peak to have this magical comeback story for RCB to defeat them one by one for the trophy

Time to make it a double winning both IPL-WPL in the same year to assert dominance",40
2024-05-19T11:57:36+00:00, Hello India,10
2024-05-19T12:44:06+00:00,"The things we've had to overcome 

- Win 6 in a row after an abysmal start with 1/8 matches won!
- Impossible odds of 0.22% chances of qualifying.
- The KKR loss due to some shady umpiring decisions 
- Having to have more than 10+ other matches going our way!
- Lost the toss when winning it mattered the most!
- Unpredictable Rain
- Having to knockout one of our worst team matchups throughout the history of the IPL
- The slow turning pitch after the rain came down.
- Losing Kohli early!
- Being one of the worst performers in clutch moments!
- Being one of the worst chokers in the history of IPL

This has been one of the greatest comebacks of RCB! Certainly feels like the greatest campaign ever!

Even if there's only a 0.22% chance. It's enough to believe you can win! 🫡 Kohli will retire one day but I hope RCB and all their fans carry this champion mentality throughout!",52
2024-05-19T13:50:45+00:00,Ball got changed after it went out of the ground. New ball was dry. That six from MSD was indeed a game changer,30
2024-05-19T14:31:44+00:00,Shivam Dube bro. 7 off 15 and got Rachin out. Hero in 2023 finals and villain yesterday. All part of the game I guess.,31
2024-05-19T15:00:44+00:00,No ex Rcbian curse from Dube. Infact thanks agent Dube,31
2024-05-19T15:47:36+00:00,This is first time a team has qualified with only 14 points in a nine or ten teams IPL.,29
