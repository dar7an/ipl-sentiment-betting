I hoped he would break the shackles of being conservative white ball opener in T20s and start smacking from ball one.

Now, he is a former shell of his peak form, and especially against spinners.

I wish we could get vINTAGE Ishan back, he was such a joy to watch.

Same with Rahul and Pant, why does everyone becomes dot ball conservative merchants and change thier playstyle as soon as they get in India?

We need intent merchants in team.

His average score would be 25’ish (quite good acc to his previous performances in T20is) but thats about it. He’ll score a rocking 70+ in a match against SA or ENG and a matured 50+ in a match against PAK or SL. There’s no point keeping high hopes and then getting underwhelmed. He def looks in good form and may deliver as well, but the other 6 batsmen would have to play a T20 like a T20 and not *roam in USA’s slow gardens*.

International bowlers have obviously figured him with the back of length and spin strategy, also apt field placements. 

We're going to have to depend on Rinku and SKY to bail us out in the world cup. Pandya is more of a bowling all rounder in this format.",6

He wanted a top spot in a different team. Can’t blame any player for that. Goes on to win a trophy as captain, good batting performance, and enters the final again next year. It’s true that Nehra/Gill played a big role there, but still. Now in 2024, MI is looking to transition from Rohit because of age. Their options are: SKY, Bumrah, Kishan. None of them have a captaincy record. Or they can approach Hardik, a proven IPL captain, ex-MI player, and the likely future ICT t20 captain. Remember, Hardik also isn’t an outsider to MI. He grew up here, helped us win 4 trophies. He has pedigree with MI. As much a claim to captaincy as Boom/SKY. The only party to blame in the whole fiasco is our management. That’s literally it.",1

This should serve as an example to them to get a lot of people (students free of cost or general public at a very low rate ) in the stadium. I don't think seats would go empty if they were like 100 rupees for those upper stands which are a lot of times empty in huge stadiums like Gujarat. People from a certain segment of the society do not need a perfect view of the pitch but the whole experience of it all. This will have multiple advantages:

1. Develop a stadium culture in the city 
2. More sales for the vendors inside the stadium 
3. Real fans can attend the stadium at a minimum cost

(This is not an alien concept. Sports like F1 and Football have general attendance tickets which are cheaper and attracts a large crowd)",10

It was an innings of 3 phases. Mumbai Indians won the powerplay convincingly thanks to some sublime hitting from Rohit Sharma, who showed us that it is a typical Wankhede wicket where you can trust the bounce and hit through the line. 

However, DC seemed to figure out that there was a patch on that surface where the ball was holding up a tad. They used the off-pace balls well and pulled things back in the middle over. From over number 7 to 15, only 63 runs were scored as MI's middle order seem to loose their way with 4 wickets going down. Axar Patel was the pivot for DC in this phase. 

However, then we entered the final lap and MI hit turbo mode. Last 5 overs saw 96 runs being scored. David and Shepherd demolishes the DC quicks who were all over the place. Too many wides as well as yorkers going wrong and being converted to full tosses and sixes, eventually.

Unimaginative throughout. Pant looks like he has no clue when anyone plays aggresively. Nortje isn't able to bowl death, so try someone else for once? Only axar looks like a bowler good enough. If Kuldeep and Mukesh don't recover, its seems very difficult that we see another win. And if we are relying on Kuldeep and Mukesh to control run flow, its says quite a bit about our bowling unit.

Batting order could have been played around with. Come up when you're chasing 235 Captain. FFS. Porel is a young lad. Take some responsibility with the bat and come up captain, especially when you're in form. 

We're stuck with all has beens and others who are still recovering. Its so frustrating to watch at this point.

We can take Abhishek Sharma along as a surprise as he can bowl too for direct swap with Jaiswal if injured to complete team of 16. Use him when he is on top form.

Sorry no Rohit, Rahul, Pant please.. or even Tilak, Jitesh etc.. sad for Ruturaj though, he doesn't fit in.
