His average score would be 25’ish (quite good acc to his previous performances in T20is) but thats about it. He’ll score a rocking 70+ in a match against SA or ENG and a matured 50+ in a match against PAK or SL. There’s no point keeping high hopes and then getting underwhelmed. He def looks in good form and may deliver as well, but the other 6 batsmen would have to play a T20 like a T20 and not *roam in USA’s slow gardens*.

He wanted a top spot in a different team. Can’t blame any player for that. Goes on to win a trophy as captain, good batting performance, and enters the final again next year. It’s true that Nehra/Gill played a big role there, but still. Now in 2024, MI is looking to transition from Rohit because of age. Their options are: SKY, Bumrah, Kishan. None of them have a captaincy record. Or they can approach Hardik, a proven IPL captain, ex-MI player, and the likely future ICT t20 captain. Remember, Hardik also isn’t an outsider to MI. He grew up here, helped us win 4 trophies. He has pedigree with MI. As much a claim to captaincy as Boom/SKY. The only party to blame in the whole fiasco is our management. That’s literally it.",1

People from a certain segment of the society do not need a perfect view of the pitch but the whole experience of it all. This will have multiple advantages:

1. Develop a stadium culture in the city

It was an innings of 3 phases. Mumbai Indians won the powerplay convincingly thanks to some sublime hitting from Rohit Sharma, who showed us that it is a typical Wankhede wicket where you can trust the bounce and hit through the line. 

However, DC seemed to figure out that there was a patch on that surface where the ball was holding up a tad. They used the off-pace balls well and pulled things back in the middle over. From over number 7 to 15, only 63 runs were scored as MI's middle order seem to loose their way with 4 wickets going down. Axar Patel was the pivot for DC in this phase. 

However, then we entered the final lap and MI hit turbo mode. Last 5 overs saw 96 runs being scored. David and Shepherd demolishes the DC quicks who were all over the place. Too many wides as well as yorkers going wrong and being converted to full tosses and sixes, eventually.

It's not a steady or steep betterment that I'm talking about. But just minor ones which have major results. Like how Bumrah is able to bowl such yorkers at that pace but not every pacer even with experience would be able to bowl like that.",5

2024-04-07T13:23:41+00:00,Rishabh Pant is obviously not done with rehab and was definitely brought back too early. Sad because this bad patch could be the  end of a very colourful career.,5
2024-04-07T13:23:41+00:00,PR tried so hard to script Pant comeback but he was always overrated as f*ck,7
2024-04-07T13:23:42+00:00,"Well this was expected from Pant but even then, what are these shots even? 😂😂",5
2024-04-07T13:23:42+00:00,Punter as a coach is probably gonna resign mid season. He hasn't seen that much humiliation at all.,3

2024-04-07T13:23:58+00:00,Sanju Samson is India's best option for the world t20 but sadly he is the last in the pecking order. Even one trick ponies like Jitesh Sharma are ahead of him,3

2024-04-07T13:24:16+00:00,It's very clear that Pant needs to get 15-20 balls in before he can go big. Why would you not send him at 3 ?,9

2024-04-07T13:25:04+00:00,It's looking like Iyer staying in DC as captain would've been better for DC and Pant. If Pant the captain worked then it would've been a great story but it hasn't been the case.,3

Batting order could have been played around with. Come up when you're chasing 235 Captain. FFS. Porel is a young lad. Take some responsibility with the bat and come up captain, especially when you're in form. 

We're stuck with all has beens and others who are still recovering. Its so frustrating to watch at this point.
