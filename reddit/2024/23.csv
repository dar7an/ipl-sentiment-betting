2024-04-09T13:26:41+00:00,I am very worried about Nattu. The wickets have dried up and he keeps conceding runs. He has a very predictable stock delivery which is a full (not yorker) delivery at 134 km/h. Batsmen have figured him out and have carted him around.,5

The only reason why Dhawan isn't being targeted is because he's a really good guy and is being saved by individual brilliance of domestic players",11
2024-04-09T13:32:45+00:00,Does Dhawan have a language barrier? He rarely praises his players and literally just said they were lucky to win the previous game.,9

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Cummins. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry.

He puts so much pressure on non strikers and doesn't let them play their natural game, rather his slow approach forces them to go all out from ball one

His captaincy and field placement are so abysmal, it's totally upto the bowler to pull out something on their own

A good captain can save easily a good 20 runs
