Will Chennai cum in unison upon seeing him bat?",4
2024-04-08T12:51:40+00:00,"KKR has an extremely shitty record against CSK which gets overshadowed by their ungodly record against MI. CSK, despite losing having 2 points less having played a game more are no doubt favorites at their home ground. Their loss to DC was bad but losing to a spirited SRH team can be excused. KKR mauled DC and beat RCB comprehensively but they're the two worst teams of this season. Their other win was against SRH and that was a good game overall which showed both side's strengths and weaknesses. Only if they win today should KKR be considered as one of the top dogs for the play-offs, and only then should CSK fans think their team is in trouble. If not, then CSK will continue on to be favorites for the play-offs as always and KKR will try to prevent a slide that haunts them at the middle of every season.",6

2024-04-08T13:27:16+00:00,"KKR look stronger on paper but CSK really need a proper template for bowling and not keep rotating them without any reason. It's probably Ruturaj's decision to do that but Dhoni needs to take control here and ask him to change that. If not , then they are just looking at another loss today , and maybe even more . Spin from overs 6-14 , that's what CSK need irrespective of the venue, it will win them more games , coz Spin with Dhoni behind the wickets and Jadeja/Theekshana bowling is a different game altogether. No other team has that kind of dominance , KKR come a close second with Narine and Chakravarty/Suyash , but not as good as CSK.",5

Very rarely would Kohli swing through the line that far away from the pitch of the ball. Because his whole career has been playing serious cricket on pitches that spin where swinging at a ball like that probably means giving your wicket away.

But it loses him and a few others so many runs on flat T20 wickets because he would just nudge that for one.

The SRH game they literally defended 7 runs in 5 balls against Klaasen, the chance of that happening is like 1 in a million.

RR on the other hand, find a new hero every match. Their biggest strength on paper is their opening partnership but until last game Buttler literally made negative runs yet they still won all 3 games they played prior. Jaiswal still hasn't got going.

If a pure batter is bought for anything over 10-12 crores, that guy has to deliver a 550+ run season at 160 SR every season.
