2024-04-26T13:16:23+00:00,"I hate how many close matches we have lost over small things. We could be comfortably sitting on atleast 8-10 points. But at the same time, the team wouldn't have deserved it, lol.",19

2024-04-26T13:25:23+00:00,I don't ask for much. Just get to the 16 points as soon as possible KKR.,4
2024-04-26T13:26:11+00:00,KKR beat Punjab 4 times in a row from 2018 to 2020. Since then they've beaten each other alternatively which currently stands at 3 each. KKR won the last game so Punjab should win this one.,7
2024-04-26T13:28:00+00:00,"Whatever you do KKR, don't let the match get to the last over. Punjab likes that.",4

2024-04-26T13:37:40+00:00,Starc wasn't purposely dropped. Last match against RCB he injured his finger in the first over itself. Even in the KKRs team video it was shown that he got injured.,55

2024-04-26T13:37:48+00:00,I think  age is catching up to da 1. He is taking a lot of time for recovery than he should have,4

2024-04-26T13:41:37+00:00,"I think resting starc is good, but dropping him entirely wouldn't be.

He's still one of the best fast bowlers of the generation, having a rough patch. He'll turn up when it matters, but that'll be hard to do if he's not getting game time before the knock outs.

He can still contribute with the bat, and they've been winning anyway. 

Hasn't even been bowling as bad as people say anyway. Some of the balls they've hit him for 6 on have not deserved it. Such is the nature of bowling the final over of t20s.",3

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

1) Push out boundaries almost to the edge of the actual ground, give a meter or two for media/cameramen. Fuck the sponsors, we have ads, electronic boards, strategic timeouts, etc. for that shit.


Pushing out boundaries will also bring more outfielders into the game.


2) Name your impact sub before the game. All rounders will be back in contention. Better, get rid of it completely. 


3) Remove the toss. Let the away team choose to bat or bowl. Controversial, I agree. But home team will have an excuse to 'doctor' pitches which will suit their team.


4) Bonus points if a team reaches a target within specified number of overs or a team wins by certain amount of runs. You want an exciting game/tournament where even now dead rubbers could be an important game.",4

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

2024-04-26T17:41:19+00:00,"Reminder that I posted this on an old account when Shashank was at SRH

Make no mistake: Shashank Singh is the most accomplished batter in SRH's history.

""What are you talking about?"", you might ask. ""He hasn't even faced a single ball."" That's all part of the genius and generosity of the great man. Unlike heartless cricketers like Hardik Pandya, who demand to get promoted up the order to showcase their skills, he prefers to give the opposition a chance, letting them face Markram and Pooran instead. He even gifts runs by bowling to level the playing field, putting selfish players like Rohit and Kohli to shame for giving up bowling themselves.

All credit to Shashank. 100% win rate for a reason.",7

But when these many sixes are being hit, the quickness of the outfield, fielding rules do not come into conversation and it's about the skill of six hitting.

Things are definitely skewed towards the batsman but the six hitting skill and confidence of a player now is much more than a player even 5 years back could've imagine, that part of cricket has developed irrespective of the rules just on skill.

Before there was era of six hitting specialists (AbD, Gayle, Pollard etc) to do this kind of stuff but now we're moving into a era where domestic players itself are now expected to be hitting sixes like this if they wanna make it to the main team let alone the international players.",13

But as of today, I think the possibility of him getting selected is very low. Why? Because we're a country that doesn't get excited unless it's a 20 year old delivering such performances. It's almost as if Barney Stinson is our national selector - anything over 30 is hugely frowned upon. Unless you're a big name - then your form doesn't matter.
