He can still contribute with the bat, and they've been winning anyway.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

1) Push out boundaries almost to the edge of the actual ground, give a meter or two for media/cameramen. Fuck the sponsors, we have ads, electronic boards, strategic timeouts, etc. for that shit.


Pushing out boundaries will also bring more outfielders into the game.


2) Name your impact sub before the game. All rounders will be back in contention. Better, get rid of it completely.¬†


3) Remove the toss. Let the away team choose to bat or bowl. Controversial, I agree. But home team will have an excuse to 'doctor' pitches which will suit their team.


4) Bonus points if a team reaches a target within specified number of overs or a team wins by certain amount of runs. You want an exciting game/tournament where even now dead rubbers could be an important game.",4

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Make no mistake: Shashank Singh is the most accomplished batter in SRH's history.

""What are you talking about?"", you might ask. ""He hasn't even faced a single ball."" That's all part of the genius and generosity of the great man. Unlike heartless cricketers like Hardik Pandya, who demand to get promoted up the order to showcase their skills, he prefers to give the opposition a chance, letting them face Markram and Pooran instead. He even gifts runs by bowling to level the playing field, putting selfish players like Rohit and Kohli to shame for giving up bowling themselves.

Ball Swinging in powerplay, spinners coming into action later on. Aggressive bowling to get the other team bowled out. BCCI have removed the bowlers out of the game.",11

So let's not even think about debuting these batsman in a WC at US where Australian drop in pitches are coming and WI pitches that get slow to bat on.

Aside from Jaiswal, Samson, Kishan, Pant, Dube and Rinku, you know the guys who have experienced a bit of international cricket, other names should not be even suggested.",20

2024-04-26T18:43:12+00:00,jimbeam07,"Had this been 10 years ago, Shashank would be pretty much in the mix for a T20 WC call up with performances like these. Power hitter, clutch, equally comfortable against spin and pace, not a bad fielder - the only thing going against him is his age. 

But as of today, I think the possibility of him getting selected is very low. Why? Because we're a country that doesn't get excited unless it's a 20 year old delivering such performances. It's almost as if Barney Stinson is our national selector - anything over 30 is hugely frowned upon. Unless you're a big name - then your form doesn't matter. Churning out talent and having a great domestic setup isn't the problem, but utilizing that talent certainly is.",30

2024-04-26T20:12:07+00:00,SBG99DesiMonster,This happens when you have finally repaired your batting order. They should have sent Shashank and Ashutosh to bat before Sam Curran as well as Jitesh from a few matches back itself. If Sam Curran or Jitesh had come to bat instead of Shashank during this match then they might have lost that plot again.,21
