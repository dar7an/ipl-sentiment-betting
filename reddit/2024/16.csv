It is unfortunate because yes, it's risky but that's what t20 is about and winners are those who end up on the right side of that risk. India's approach will never work.

2024-04-03T14:53:56+00:00,atbg1936,"The blue jay Shah (Cyanocitta cristata Shah) is a passerine nepo baby in the family Corvidae, native to India. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized, each of which write their own scripts.

The blue Jay Shah feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later;[2] soft fruits; arthropods; occasionally small vertebrates; and IPL fan tears. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jay Shahs can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have even been found to have decapitated other birds.[3]

It builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree; both sexes participate. The clutch may be two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with darker brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may stay with their parents for one to two months.

The name Jay derives from the nepo baby's noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.[4] Jay Shahs are also called jaybirds.[5]",8

SRH doesn't have a deep line-up and still play very attacking cricket. That means they can score 277 if they click but also fail in the very next game like we saw. 

It's pitches like these that have made anchors irrelevant. If we had a balanced pitch, anchors would still be important. 

Teams like England, WI, even Australia to some extent have excellent batting depth which supports attacking cricket at all times regardless of loss of wickets. India, for all its resources and prowess, doesn't have that luxury. So they have to rely on assigning roles to players.

It's a game where a single wrong decision by umpire can potentially change the course of the match. In that case why not just delegate the job of deciding out/ not out entirely to technology. Umpires can remain on the ground just to ensure smooth conduct of the game. No umpires call drama, no leaning towards ""on field call"" when the third umpire doesn't have ""conclusive"" evidence to overturn. Just technology all the way through is better imo.",-1

He's got a tough job to do today - bit of a below par score put up by Australia, only 413 off their 20 overs, but the bowlers won't make this easy for him. 

Speaking of bowlers, steaming in to open the bowling for Australia is Andrew Starc - Healy, who some of our keen cricket bloodline aficionado's will recognise as the grandchild of Mitchell Starc and Alyssa Healy, forced by Cricket Australia to marry into the McGrath bloodline to keep the bowling breeding stock pure. 

Oh, he's done it! He's knocked him over! Andrew is screaming and trying to power up into a Super Saiyan, shouting ""Nah, I'd ~~win~~ take your wicket!"" at Arjun Jr as he slowly makes his way back to the pavilion.

Vaibhav bowls a fullish ball outside off, and then the ball swings into Shaw. He tries to play a straight drive but hits it more towards mid-on. The ball doesn't gather a lot of air, so Varun has to take the tough route of diving forward. Mission possible, and the TV umpire confirms that the catch is clean too.
