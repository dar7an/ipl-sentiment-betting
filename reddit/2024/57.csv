Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your ORANGE CAP. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for LSG this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of LSG on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 ORANGE CAP.

I don't think LSG will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

2024-05-08T17:25:28+00:00,beanythingbutacunt,Goenka is a seasoned businessman so he should know better than to yell at Rahul in front of cameras. I know they shat the bed today but holy fuck the tough conversations can take place behind closed doors. Shah Rukh doesn't go berserk even when KKR get thrashed,23

Hope someone eggs his ass on the way home",36

2024-05-08T20:05:44+00:00,SBG99DesiMonster,I was about to make fun about KL but I saw that video about Sanjiv Goenka publicly humiliating him. I would be standing with KL on that. That was absolutely disgraceful and unprofessional from Sanjiv Goenka. That guy has done that during the past as well. I remember about him publicly making snarky comment about Dhoni on Twitter while Dhoni was still playing for RPS. That man clearly has no decency or professionalism. If big sportsmen are facing that from him then I wonder about what the regular people that are employees in whatever company he runs have to deal with.,27
