2024-04-25T15:00:11+00:00,hellboy786,"Dear Kohli


Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for RCB this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of RCB on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think RCB will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.",7

Kohli needs to play more straight. He cannot handle spinner by swinging a cross bat. His straight shots have disappeared for some reason. 

Even with straight bat he tries to play on the leg side more often than not. That‚Äôs not gonna help him at all.

The only problem with playing straight is he has to judge the line well in advance which is the exact reason he is playing cross. He is not able to judge the line early and is trying to be play comfortable shots when ball is much closer. But all these shots are good when you are a power hitter and not timer of ball.",6

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Impact in line and that was dropping to hit the base of leg stump. Swapnil Singh, hit for a four first ball, gets the big wicket of Markram next.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.
