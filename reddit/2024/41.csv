Since then
Bhumrah has gone a level higher.....

Bhuvi sadly has lost his swing. Class is still there but not sure what how he lost his swing..

Atleast nattu is slowly making his way back to his best.... If he keeps this up, considering the WC is just 5 days away, Nattu if he continues this, could do well for us...",3

2024-04-25T14:55:35+00:00,Kohli's playing style of anchoring and taking the match deep only works while chasing 170-180 targets. This is the same reason Kohli won the match against Pakistan but was blown away by Buttler and Hales aggressive approach when Kohli made a 40 ball 50.,7
2024-04-25T14:55:35+00:00,50(20)>100(65) in t20s,13

2024-04-25T15:00:11+00:00,"Dear Kohli


Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for RCB this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of RCB on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think RCB will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.",7

T20 is about hitting maximum boundaries now. Strike rotation, fitness, 1s into 2s are all secondary skills in T20 cricket if you can't hit boundaries.

Even with straight bat he tries to play on the leg side more often than not. That‚Äôs not gonna help him at all.

The only problem with playing straight is he has to judge the line well in advance which is the exact reason he is playing cross.

2024-04-25T15:16:40+00:00,In my armchair expert opinion Kohli is having the Sehwag and Yuvraj problem. Relying a lot on the hand eye coordination for the shots. With time it is fading slowly. There will be days where it will come off but days were despite trying it will not come off. It will take loss like the Ind vs SL 2014 T20 WC semi-final to realize the scope of the problem.,10

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

2024-04-25T17:27:51+00:00,"Dear Shabaz


Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.
