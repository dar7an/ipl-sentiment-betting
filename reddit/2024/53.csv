He is having a heated argument with the match referee Virat Kohli. Reports say that Anushka Sharma is live streaming the incident on her Instagram, victimising Virat Kohli. Virat doesn't allow a re-toss! The eternal commentator Sunny G and 97 man Gautam Gambhir have walked to oppose Kohli. They seem to not care about CSK. Just here to bash Kohli.

2) He's literally a domestic player ffs, he isn't going to represent India or something like that lmao.

Today there were good hands from Mitchell and Thakur, and a very good innings from Jadeja. However, it‚Äôs hard to understand how someone like Thakur can concentrate freely on their batting and the ball that‚Äôs coming, when all that can be heard so loudly are chants of ‚ÄúDHONI, DHONI!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWE WANT DHONI!‚Äù. Surely that does anything but help the batter on strike, and is actually quite a negative distraction. The failure to support the batter on strike, and recognise the issue, speaks to the toxicity of CSK‚Äôs fanbase, which of course was there in large numbers during the innings today. I used to love CSK, especially due to Indian legends like Dhoni and Jadeja, who have won so many games for them. But now having seen the problems with so many of their fans, I am less inclined to do so in the future. This likely won‚Äôt be popular or necessary to say, but just the perspective of an unbiased Indian fan",12

Will bairstow remain a one match wonder? And why does Sam curran promote himself up the order if he doesn't play like it? 

Shashank and Ashutosh I think can't play spin well. But we could have had a more matured innings from the top 5 batsmen. Punjab is out of playoffs now",11

2024-05-05T13:44:46+00:00,Man that horrible bowling after 90-8 was hair pulling stuff. Rutu needs to improve a bit in captaincy. Bowlers also just kept bowling short and wide. He is younger than other players but he needs to use his authority as captain. Simply bowling at the stumps would have done this job.,9
2024-05-05T13:44:57+00:00,Really great bowling by Santner,9

Then win 3-3 throught to win the IPL trophy and give Thala his farewell ..

They don't have they're primary bowlers Parthirana , Fizz and Deepak

They're batting is over dependent on Dube and Rutu

Jadeja and spinners has been hot and cold entire season

Who could keep a straight face the longest. The Cheshire Cat, known for its mischievous grin, was confident it would win. However, Gambhir, with his legendary poker face, took the challenge seriously. Days turned into weeks, and neither of them showed a hint of a smile. As the contest continued, Gambhir's expression became so fixed that even when he tried to smile, his face refused to cooperate, having forgotten how! And so, the legend goes, Gambhir never smiles not because he's grumpy, but because he's still trying to win that bet with the Cheshire Cat, who, rumor has it, is still grinning somewhere in Wonderland.",5

2024-05-05T15:01:27+00:00,"In the mystical world of cricket, there's a little-known secret behind Sunil Narine's exceptional performance as a batsman in the IPL. It is said that Narine stumbled upon a magical cricket bat hidden within the depths of Eden Gardens. This bat, crafted from the legendary Crickethor tree, was enchanted by a cricket-loving wizard. The wizard, a fan of twists and turns, cast a spell that would only activate when the bat was wielded by a bowler rather than a batsman. As fate would have it, Narine, primarily known for his spin bowling, decided to give batting a go and the bat sprang to life! With each swing, the bat guides the ball to the boundary with the precision of a homing missile. And so, Narine's unexpected batting prowess continues to baffle opponents and spectators alike, all thanks to a whimsical wizard's love for a good surprise in the game.",6
