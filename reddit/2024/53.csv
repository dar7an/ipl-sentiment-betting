""Finally, the IPL committee has decided to use a rigged coin to make the toss fair for CSK. The coin is heads on both sides. Ashutosh Sharma tosses the coin and Rutu calls heads. And the coin lands on its side! Can you believe it! Ashutosh wins the toss! Wait a minute. Is that.......? Yes it is! Dhoni walks into the ground, just like it's 2019! He is having a heated argument with the match referee Virat Kohli. Reports say that Anushka Sharma is live streaming the incident on her Instagram, victimising Virat Kohli. Virat doesn't allow a re-toss! The eternal commentator Sunny G and 97 man Gautam Gambhir have walked to oppose Kohli. They seem to not care about CSK. Just here to bash Kohli. Ashutosh is declared the toss winner. But there's a twist! Thala denies a choice to Ashutosh Sharma! Just like he used to deny singles to his team mates! And Thala chooses Punjab will have a bowl!

1) He doesn't play in Wankhede ,Chinnaswamy or Eden Garden where the boundaries are smaller than your backyard and the pitch is a national highway

2) He's literally a domestic player ffs, he isn't going to represent India or something like that lmao. 

Stop being so salty, lmao(especially the fans of a certain underachieving franchise)

And btw according to Cricinfo Smart Stats(which take pitch and Strike rate into account) only Travis Head has a higher per match impact as pure batsman than him.",6

Today there were good hands from Mitchell and Thakur, and a very good innings from Jadeja. However, it‚Äôs hard to understand how someone like Thakur can concentrate freely on their batting and the ball that‚Äôs coming, when all that can be heard so loudly are chants of ‚ÄúDHONI, DHONI!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWE WANT DHONI!‚Äù. Surely that does anything but help the batter on strike, and is actually quite a negative distraction. The failure to support the batter on strike, and recognise the issue, speaks to the toxicity of CSK‚Äôs fanbase, which of course was there in large numbers during the innings today. I used to love CSK, especially due to Indian legends like Dhoni and Jadeja, who have won so many games for them. But now having seen the problems with so many of their fans, I am less inclined to do so in the future. This likely won‚Äôt be popular or necessary to say, but just the perspective of an unbiased Indian fan",12

The wizard, a fan of twists and turns, cast a spell that would only activate when the bat was wielded by a bowler rather than a batsman. As fate would have it, Narine, primarily known for his spin bowling, decided to give batting a go and the bat sprang to life! With each swing, the bat guides the ball to the boundary with the precision of a homing missile. And so, Narine's unexpected batting prowess continues to baffle opponents and spectators alike, all thanks to a whimsical wizard's love for a good surprise in the game.",6
