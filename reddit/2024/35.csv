2024-04-20T17:37:50+00:00,livelifereal,"I am still trying to make sense of that Pant innings. I felt as if he was watchful to begin with. Like for the first 6-7 balls. It was somewhat understandable. He went about his business this way in the previous game too and made up for a slow start. The situation too demanded him to stitch a bit of a partnership given that DC had lost 4 wickets. 

But after that, it seemed that he just couldn't put the slower bouncers away. He tried swiping at the ball and failed on a numerous occasions. Which is strange because I don't remember ever noticing that to be a standout weakness of his. However, that is basically all that Pat Cummins has dished out to him. So, I reckon that the SRH bowlers did their homework and perhaps that is one ball that Pant is not particularly strong against. It just hasn't come to fore before today. 

I could be wrong, but this is what makes sense to me. Also, somebody help me decode why Cummins slowie has been so hard to get away with tonigh? It's not just the slow bumpers, but whenever he has bowled slow. What makes his slowie so tough to put away?",14
