Indian all rounders in T20.

  
Seriously, name me one Indian in IPL that have given an all rounder performance.

Jadeja and Axar are good enough bowlers but Damn , they are worse baters than many teams' taileneders batters, its disrespect calling them all rounders.

Pandya is a trash bolwer and trash finisher, I dunno where he stands for team India selection. Why? After all selection should be based on form, and he is a shitty finisher and bolwer, and thats going to be his role in T20WC. What a joke.

Tell me one good all rounder this whole IPL for India, you can not.

India is not going to lose wc because anchors, or old guards or because lack of Intent, they gonna lose becuase we have got JADEJA, AXAR AND PAndya as our finishers, i dunno man, if i was an opner, i damn sure woukd be scared to show intent when your batting ends after 4 down

I think that's happening with Pandya after all his injuries and probably with KL. You want everyone to keep being peak level but it's not possible. Sad but true. Even Rinku and SKY won't be the same in a few years, so please, let's play those who are in their peak zone right now.",7

I'll run when he calls and take guard, the entire time forcing myself to think of sixes while my thoughts drift back to dot balls. I won't be able to score and I'll eventually go back to being off strike, angry. Sometimes we will look across the wicket and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

Omarzai can easily bowl 4 overs and be a pinch hitter in middle order

2024-04-07T17:43:14+00:00,Is Mayank injured?,7
2024-04-07T17:43:24+00:00,LSG have played 13 matches where they had to defend 160+ total and have won all. Damn,23

2024-04-07T17:43:49+00:00,High time for GT to realise that SRK > 3D.,15
2024-04-07T17:43:53+00:00,"How has LSG won so many matches batting first, KL must be doing something right.",14

‚Äì Hardik Pandya, probably",16

2024-04-07T17:44:06+00:00,How does krunal produce these bowling figure in every couple of seasons,9
2024-04-07T17:44:28+00:00,"What a win! Didn't expect at all. It looked below par score. 
Great bowling effort",9
2024-04-07T17:44:32+00:00,"Imagine scenes if all three of RCB, CSK and MI fail to qualify",9
2024-04-07T17:44:42+00:00,FIREWORKS SOUND LIKE BONG HITS üò≠üò≠,6
2024-04-07T17:44:47+00:00,"Even when LSG play good the adrenaline junkies say poor batting to GT. Common yaar, give credit to KL and his excellent captaincy",13
2024-04-07T17:44:59+00:00,Gill should have played more slow.,8
2024-04-07T17:45:14+00:00,"Most of us thought that 163 was under-par, and maybe it was, but LSG bowled really well.",8
2024-04-07T17:45:19+00:00,Langer for Indian coach,2
2024-04-07T17:45:27+00:00,Nehra has zilch idea about creating an aggressive batting line-up. A team full of anchors having no idea how to accelerate when 3 wickets fall. How surprising.,13
2024-04-07T17:45:33+00:00,I hate to say it but LSG is strongest contender after KKR to win this IPL..RR has always started strong but they lack the killer mentality to win knockouts when it counts,11
2024-04-07T17:46:11+00:00,Ok.. just hope gambhir and dhoni dont hug it out tomorrow and ruin the fun,10
2024-04-07T17:46:24+00:00,Hardik changing teams went on to be a bad deal for both teams involved,20
2024-04-07T17:46:41+00:00,"Actually good to see Gill speaking the truth.

Not any excuses of pitch, just straight up said we batted shit.",22
2024-04-07T17:46:44+00:00,This batting line up just doesn't cut it. You can't have Darshan Nalkande coming in at 6. That's just pathetic.,10
2024-04-07T17:46:44+00:00,"If GT didn‚Äôt make it to playoffs, HP is going to get undue credit",11
2024-04-07T17:47:02+00:00,Krunal is officially the better pandya,20
2024-04-07T17:47:17+00:00,This is why you need anchor. When an collapse is imminent such as today,6
2024-04-07T17:47:27+00:00,I hope krunal gets the motm,6
2024-04-07T17:47:42+00:00,"Props to Gill, no excuses. Just honesty.",12
2024-04-07T17:47:45+00:00,Krunal wins you matches and gold,17

2024-04-07T17:48:50+00:00,"Titans batting has taken a big hit since last year, no real aggressors in top/middle order and finishers are out of form",8
2024-04-07T17:48:56+00:00,So Gujarat Titans is an average team this year & will most probably miss the playoffs due to their strike-rate or batting issues ü§î,11
2024-04-07T17:49:10+00:00,"This is surely sketchy. As soon as one yadav comes to play today in Mumbai after injury, another yadav disappears.hmmmm",39
2024-04-07T17:49:23+00:00,"GT needs miller time back , otherwise they are not qualifying",12
2024-04-07T17:50:14+00:00,GT batting is paper thin,6
2024-04-07T17:50:37+00:00,Pandya has become likeable,3
2024-04-07T17:51:10+00:00,"GT looked so formidable last year, hope they can get their stride again",10

2024-04-07T17:54:36+00:00,"Seriously impressive from LSG, pulling this defence off after losing their newly uncovered ace after one over, even with luck otherwise being on their side and the help they received from GT.",16

Like no one knows wtf ekana is",7
2024-04-07T17:57:16+00:00,Is there any confirmation for seriousness of mayank's injury,8
2024-04-07T17:57:42+00:00,"LSG is definitely the new CSK. Better than the sum of its parts. Dodgy home pitch, KL is also turning into Thala, being the most stubborn and thick skinned modern day cricketer after Dhoni himself.",27
