They surely would want Burger in the team when he is fit, but he would keep Butler out of team, which any sane team would not want.


But keeping burger out leaves RR with merely five bowlers, with Sen , Avesh and Ashwin anyone can have bad day and their whole plan would collapse.


They are essentially beginning with merely five bowlers, a strategy I never consider safe in T20s.


And why is Maharaj suddenly out if contention when Ashwin overall has been average this season?


Man, RR have great team but as they say too many cooks spoil the fish, they can have all their plans jumbled. They definitely are treading a thin line",2

A seven-year-old boy was at the center of a Bangaluru courtroom drama yesterday when he challenged a court ruling over who should have custody of him. The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possible.

The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him.

After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. 

After two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Royal Challenger Bengaluru, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone!",11

2024-04-16T16:51:54+00:00,LetterheadOk1762,"Why do the purists on this sub hate  watch T20 leagues when T20 Internationals are way different from T20 leagues and get upset when 200+ runs are scored frequently 

Why hate watch something that you don't like you aren't even the target audience of this league?

Just turn off the TV when you feel if the game isn't for you 

Or do most people here don't actually watch the games and just make their opinions on the basis of scorecards 

Salt and Russell two intent merchants made 23 off 23 Iyer made 11 off 7 so they all made 34 off 30 

So the whole why not use a bowling machine arguments are stupid

Rinku also didn't look in full flow today and Narine slowed after his 100 he made 9 off his next 7 balls
So that's 41 off 37, Venky made 8 off 6 and Ramandeep scored a single in his only delivery so that's
So that's 50 off 43 which is basically an anchor innings 

RR also gave 21 Extras in this innings 

That's 50 off 43 (71 off 43)

So they basically made 152 off 77 

And it took One of their most in-form batters to bash the two best spinners in the opposition team 

The likelihood of Ashwin and Chahal conceding so many is very rare

So it wasn't as flat as you believe 

Boult also went for 31 in his 4 on this wicket on every flat pitch qualify bowlers like Bumrah, Cummins, Boult, Vaibhav Arora also went for 3-27 in his 4 against DC in Vizag so the whole argument that Not everyone can be Bumrah bro doesn't hold true

Real fact is there isn't enough fast bowling talent in India to cover up 10 teams and the Impact player rule does make a difference but the first point is one of the bigger reasons as to why so many games are low scoring.

Also the lack of Saturday Double Headers also is partially responsible for it

Once all pitches reach 4 to 5 games each they will began to slow down

Tldr: The pitch is flat but isn't a pitch where bowlers have nothing and you can blindly slog and strike at 200+",4
