8. Santner
9. Thakur
10. Chahar 
11. Gleeson/Pathirana 

Impact player - Despande/Mukesh

Mitchell needs time to settle and then explode and him as an opener could be an ideal use of him 

Rachin/Moeen have to play at number 3 ( based on availability) and they can play pinch hitter role 

Dube will come back strong, Rahane should be given free license to go hard in order counterattack in middle order rather than use him as an opener 

Jadeja, Dhoni can do the finishing with batting depth from Santner, Thakur and Chahar 

Pathirana will play if not then Gleeson

Despande will play if not Mukesh",3

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for CSK this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of CSK on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium pace 100.

I don't think CSK will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

But calm down PBKS fans , save this energy when PBKS actually qualifies for a playoff , CSK is not looking good  this year and may lose the race to playoffs , but your team is hardly ever in the race , can't remain satisfied with thrilling games which they lose 6/10 times only , yk.",-53

2024-05-01T18:43:34+00:00,Assassin_Ankur,Looking at the comments in the mid-innings you would have thought that this would be an easy win for CSK.,10

2024-05-01T23:48:49+00:00,SBG99DesiMonster,I think that Santner directly comes into the team instead of Mustafizur. If it isn't working anyway then I wouldn't mind that there is an extra spinner that could also bat in the team. If there is a pitch that is flat then a fast bowler could be playing instead of Santner during that match.,13
