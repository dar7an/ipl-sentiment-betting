Miller and Gill open for a change. Miller scores a quickfire 35(10) but gets out. Bhuvi and Nattu keep getting wickets but Gill is firm at the other end. Bhuvi bowls the last over to Gill and 5 is required of 2. He hits the ball straight to Pat Cummins down the ground and he celebrates. But there's a twist. Cummins stepped on the ropes. GT win!

Chris Gayle, the flamboyant West Indian cricketer, is known for his powerful batting and charismatic personality. One of the funniest moments involving Gayle occurred during a Big Bash League match in Australia. While giving a live interview on the boundary line, Gayle, never one to miss an opportunity for humor, famously told the reporter, ""Don't blush, baby,"" after playfully asking her out for drinks. The cheeky comment caused a media stir and became an instant viral sensation, perfectly capturing Gayle's larger-than-life persona and playful nature.",4
