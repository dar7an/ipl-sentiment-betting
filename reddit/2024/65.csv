2024-05-15T13:07:51+00:00,LowWarm,RR literally went on a 3 match losing streak so they could match up in quality with bottom placed PBKS for L classico. Couple goals.,13
2024-05-15T13:08:55+00:00,TheCricDude,"RR should go back to how it started and just make the replacements.

1. Yashasvi
2. Kohler-Cadmore \*
3. Sanju
4. Riyan
5. Jurel
6. Hetty / Donovan / Powell \*
7. Ashwin
8. Boult \*
9. Burger \*
10. Avesh
11. Chahal
12. IP : Sandeep / Shubham

Works both batting and bowling first. After Burger's injury and the miss, the team took different shape slowly every game. Roles got changed too much. Sandeep was superb as death overs specialist. Keep him for that one role. Mohit and Sandeep are done with new ball here.",3

Kohli and Patel have improved tremendously in the 2nd half but they haven't been better than Head oe Bumrah.
