2024-03-29T13:32:33+00:00,"Gambhir is a very miserable man, and he gives you so many life lessons in how not to live.

If you yourself are not content with what you’ve done and achieved, you’ll never be self confident and happy. He’s won a World Cup for his country, won two IPL titles taking a dogshit team to glory, left behind a wonderful legacy for that franchise to revel in…yet he wants to beat the team that hasn’t won. His head to head against MI is the worst head to head record in the league against any team ever, but he can’t be bothered about that. I’m sure even rational kkr fans would want the focus to be on a title - but no, his ambition is only to beat the team he thinks is tinpot because our fans admire the team like nothing else. Clearly, despite his own success he doesn’t think it elevates the franchise. He doesn’t want higher heights, because that’s the real difficult thing to do. He just wants others to think he’s great, and even with the love his own fans give him, he can’t see it. If I was a KKR fan, I’d expect better, certainly from someone in a coaching capacity 

KKR doesn’t have the numbers or the unconditional support that we do, and he doesn’t like that. He doesn’t like that Kohli has fans. He doesn’t like that Dhoni has fans. He wants it all, but can’t realize that success alone can’t buy you loyalty and fame. He can’t even fathom that people still support Rcb despite our losses.

What a bitter, bitter man. I truly pity him.",16

Are we going to witness something similar to Wankhede? No. He is trying to calm things down. Oh wait, Vijay Mallya, is that the ex-RCB owner? WOWWW! Unreal things are happening. Vijay Mallya is lading from a chopper. He is back! Mallya is back to India but even before he could put a step on the field, they have put handcuffs on both his feet. Meanwhile Gambhir and Virat have torn each other's sleeves and throwing punches after punches which hasn't connected even once like it's Suryakumar Yadav batting in World Cup 2023 final. This madness is showing no sign to stop. Fans have flooded the ground. Some are trying to pull out the stumps while some are abusing Murali Karthik in the stump mic for calling Yash Dayal trash, RCB fans are brutal. Everyone is fighting their own battle.

2024-03-29T15:38:27+00:00,If the actual pitch is slowing down this could be salvaged. But didn't look like it when DK was hitting.,8
2024-03-29T15:38:27+00:00,Probably Kohli's strike rate was better against spin than pacers tonight (21/12 against Narine),7
2024-03-29T15:38:27+00:00,"Won't be an easy chase at all.

Our top order is top tier garbage.",11
2024-03-29T15:38:30+00:00,Kohli after the 50  should have accelerated better. Batting first you can't play 10 over for 82 runs.,11
2024-03-29T15:38:30+00:00,"An innings that didn't really get the momentum it needed. This is a below par total, I feel. Yes, the slower ones seem to be hard to hit, but I don't think RCB has the bowling to pull that off. I think KKR will win this with an over or two to spare.",1
2024-03-29T15:38:33+00:00,Stop height shaming Green,8
2024-03-29T15:38:33+00:00,"This score looks 15 more than a par score.

2024-03-29T15:38:41+00:00,"Starc winning in life - highest paid player this year, gets bashed around but doesn't matter cos he's won the trophies that actually matter in WC and WTC. 

And we have our try hard Indian players like DK and virat who will do well here but never actually deliver on the big stage like WC semis/finals.",4
2024-03-29T15:38:42+00:00,So I guess we'll see Starc directly in the BGT after this since he's clearly not going to the T20 WC with this kind of bowling,7

Because they didn't score enough? Maxwell did his bit. He couldn't go on because he was forced to keep slogging, even against good balls. Why? Because Kohli refused to score at more than run-a-ball in the middle overs. Same for Patidar. Come in, forced to slog because Kohli can't score boundaries, get out slogging, fans blame you and hate you and praise Kohli anyway. What a scam. No wonder Indian players all turn into anchors.

2024-03-29T16:19:13+00:00,The ability to maximize the powerplay is priceless. This is also why India can't win the T20WC: the first six overs matter and Rohit and KL opening sets us up for failure in this format from the get go,8

2024-03-29T16:25:54+00:00,"Love how Kohli is getting shit but not enough credit given to KKR's bowlers lol. They bowled really well, especially in the middle overs.

Everyone knows Kohli isn't a T20 player in the mould of ABD or Gayle. Going at 170+ SR game after game isn't his style. This isn't exactly a secret, so what exactly are the RCB fans complaining about? 

He wasn't able to accelerate today at the same level he usually does (or used to do), but that happens from time to time. Again, good bowling by KKR.

There is plenty of evidence that the RCB management is dogshit, maybe don't blame Kohli for everything? 

The man's done more than enough for every team he's played in. He's not perfect, sure, but perfection is the enemy of progress. Let him breathe, for God's sake. The management and team selection needs to change WAY before Kohli's batting style does.",11

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “Not Kohli. Not Kohli.” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen bottles of steroids in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the steroid bottles and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bottle and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

2024-03-29T17:02:04+00:00,I think RCB has no chance of winning as long as Kohli plays for them. He just drags down the team and being an icon never gets criticized. He's not worth so much money and RCB can start afresh with young players after he retires,9

It's so evident that the team management is just lost in a mish mash of ideas. Players like Maxwell and Dad hardly give a fuck. Even Kohli is just playing for his WC spot now. This bowling attack is irredeemable but ending their batting innings with such a whimper at the Chinnasamy is unforgivable imo.

T20s isn't like ODIs or Tests, there is no scope for grinding opponents down, there is little spin and pitch doesn't slow down nearly enough. 

  
Absolutely zero point in playing for milestones. And this is not a jibe at Koach, in fact he plays at a strike rate of 138.2, his strike rate for RCB is 130.2.  He scores quicker and more for India. This RCB team is confused to the nth level. I feel for Virat, he probably won't win the IPL as the team management/owners have no clue how to make a team.",2
