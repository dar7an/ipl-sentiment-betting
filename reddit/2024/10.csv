2024-03-29T13:32:33+00:00,koalashell,"Gambhir is a very miserable man, and he gives you so many life lessons in how not to live.

If you yourself are not content with what you’ve done and achieved, you’ll never be self confident and happy. He’s won a World Cup for his country, won two IPL titles taking a dogshit team to glory, left behind a wonderful legacy for that franchise to revel in…yet he wants to beat the team that hasn’t won. His head to head against MI is the worst head to head record in the league against any team ever, but he can’t be bothered about that. I’m sure even rational kkr fans would want the focus to be on a title - but no, his ambition is only to beat the team he thinks is tinpot because our fans admire the team like nothing else. Clearly, despite his own success he doesn’t think it elevates the franchise. He doesn’t want higher heights, because that’s the real difficult thing to do. He just wants others to think he’s great, and even with the love his own fans give him, he can’t see it. If I was a KKR fan, I’d expect better, certainly from someone in a coaching capacity 

KKR doesn’t have the numbers or the unconditional support that we do, and he doesn’t like that. He doesn’t like that Kohli has fans. He doesn’t like that Dhoni has fans. He wants it all, but can’t realize that success alone can’t buy you loyalty and fame. He can’t even fathom that people still support Rcb despite our losses.

What a bitter, bitter man. I truly pity him.",16

Are we going to witness something similar to Wankhede? No. He is trying to calm things down. Oh wait, Vijay Mallya, is that the ex-RCB owner? WOWWW! Unreal things are happening. Vijay Mallya is lading from a chopper. He is back! Mallya is back to India but even before he could put a step on the field, they have put handcuffs on both his feet. Meanwhile Gambhir and Virat have torn each other's sleeves and throwing punches after punches which hasn't connected even once like it's Suryakumar Yadav batting in World Cup 2023 final. This madness is showing no sign to stop. Fans have flooded the ground. Some are trying to pull out the stumps while some are abusing Murali Karthik in the stump mic for calling Yash Dayal trash, RCB fans are brutal. Everyone is fighting their own battle.

Because they didn't score enough? Maxwell did his bit. He couldn't go on because he was forced to keep slogging, even against good balls. Why? Because Kohli refused to score at more than run-a-ball in the middle overs. Same for Patidar. Come in, forced to slog because Kohli can't score boundaries, get out slogging, fans blame you and hate you and praise Kohli anyway. What a scam. No wonder Indian players all turn into anchors. The fans don't value anything but runs, even at the expense of strike rate, which matters a hell of a lot in T20s.",4

Everyone knows Kohli isn't a T20 player in the mould of ABD or Gayle. Going at 170+ SR game after game isn't his style. This isn't exactly a secret, so what exactly are the RCB fans complaining about? 

He wasn't able to accelerate today at the same level he usually does (or used to do), but that happens from time to time. Again, good bowling by KKR.

There is plenty of evidence that the RCB management is dogshit, maybe don't blame Kohli for everything?

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “Not Kohli. Not Kohli.” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen bottles of steroids in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the steroid bottles and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bottle and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Absolutely zero point in playing for milestones. And this is not a jibe at Koach, in fact he plays at a strike rate of 138.2, his strike rate for RCB is 130.2.  He scores quicker and more for India.

Don’t know how much of his slowdown was due to poor execution or lack of intent, but he will know that his innings overall didn’t help much. At least the one positive is that he’s gone straight back to scoring good runs after a few months out of cricket.",-1

Do people forget shit like November 19th so easily?  India is overall not good enough to win this sort of stuff.",11

2024-03-29T18:06:25+00:00,bengabi85,"One important point Shreyas mentioned during the presentation was that it was Russel who figured out the pitch between his spell and went for slower ball approach. And the other bowlers followed. If they could do that in game, what the hell even those RCB bowlers were watching. They had a whole innings and a break in between to plan.. clowns",83
