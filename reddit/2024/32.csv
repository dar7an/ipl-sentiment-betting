2024-04-17T14:48:04+00:00,"So its not IPL as a whole its more certain grounds and the pitches curated to the home team that are producing high scoring matches. RCB, KKR, MI are batting heavy teams compared to bowling so they are going to prepare flat pitches with their batsmen ready. SRH seems to have 4 destructive batsmen who can deal in 6s in small grounds. Its the team makeup and they sacrificed some bowling for that. You're not going to get high scores in ahmedabad because GT depends more on their bowling with the spinners coming into play. I think the horrible balance that certain teams have(MI, RCB => only batting not much bowling) is contributing to the high scores.",2

Tewatia's finish, unfulfilled promise,
Collapse, dream lost, season gone stale.

Rashid, a warrior, hero of the game,
Fights with bat and ball, spirit aflame.
Beacon of hope, in dark of night,

Team striving to soar, once again score.

Rashid's spirit, fire that burns bright.",1
