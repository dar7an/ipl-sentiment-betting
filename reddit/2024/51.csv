2024-05-03T13:19:40+00:00,Ramandeep Singh should have been bowling more. If he was in some kind of form it would’ve helped in the fast bowling all rounder search. It’s funny that KKR management derailed both of their R Singh’s in a way,6

2024-05-03T13:39:24+00:00,Rohit probably got tired of this shit and decided to just bat,6
2024-05-03T13:39:28+00:00,Why are they not playing Shephard anymore? Or will they leave out Sharma and try Naman at the top today? With Shephard coming in later?,3

2024-05-03T15:57:07+00:00,Fast accurate Yorkers are what matter. Starc could hit 3-4 in his heyday. Now Bumrah can hit 4 around 140k. What matters is an accurate 145+ ball and some accurate slow well disguised stuff. Tye is a great example of not being relevant anymore because he can't hit 145 on his quick one and even when he hit's that pace he doesn't have accuracy. Bumrah makes you think he's around 140with accuracy or his slower ones have the batter guessing until the ball hits the pitch. Only archer and wood can do better now. Archer with his high 140s Yorkers and wood with accurate 150's that you have to play for. Bumrah has a 140 Yorker that he can nail constantly and that makes him the most dangerous bowler,3

I agree you shouldn’t strike at 110-120, but anchoring is a necessity of the game when it’s not played on roads.  

Look how beautifully Pandey anchored the game today. Yes he’s lacking in high scoring games, but this is also a talent. He has a technically solid game (Ranji captain) so he’s able to anchor with ease.   

I’m hoping for Pandya and SKY to play well today and take their form into the World Cup

He dots one, takes single on the last ball of the over. Nortje has the ball and tries to intimidate Thala with a surprising Sling action on the first bowl only to get hit for a six on the long-on. He hits sixes on the next 2 balls too. Ind needs 5 on 2 and then we suddenly hear Sting’s music only to see Rayudu come out with another *3D in the bank* contract, cashes in and enters the match replacing Kuldeep. Thala has seen a ghost and doesn’t know how to comprehend the situation. Nortje is ready to bowl a yorker but before he could bowl, Rayudu steps out reaching a quarter of the crease and screams, “*Mankad me ya fucking idiot*”. Nortje simply cannot bottle this and runs for his life towards the wicket to hit the stumps and done.

Rayudu costs Ind the match only to hijack the production room and announce on live telecast, “*Haha I was not letting Thala insult me once again, Was I?*”.",6

Don't think it's fair to compare to Pollard.

That's something Tim lacks. He hasn't played FC cricket.. His game isn't completely developed in way that someone who has played some amounts of red ball cricket will be.
