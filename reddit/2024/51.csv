2024-05-03T15:57:07+00:00,Papertiger88,Fast accurate Yorkers are what matter. Starc could hit 3-4 in his heyday. Now Bumrah can hit 4 around 140k. What matters is an accurate 145+ ball and some accurate slow well disguised stuff. Tye is a great example of not being relevant anymore because he can't hit 145 on his quick one and even when he hit's that pace he doesn't have accuracy. Bumrah makes you think he's around 140with accuracy or his slower ones have the batter guessing until the ball hits the pitch. Only archer and wood can do better now. Archer with his high 140s Yorkers and wood with accurate 150's that you have to play for. Bumrah has a 140 Yorker that he can nail constantly and that makes him the most dangerous bowler,3

That's something Tim lacks. He hasn't played FC cricket.. His game isn't completely developed in way that someone who has played some amounts of red ball cricket will be.

Unless Hardik makes a comeback in T20WC, him staying as MI captain would be absolute no-no, massive MI boycott will happen, him even staying in MI as a player would be shaky, crowd will be just as bad or worse for him.

If he does choose to leave or gets released by Ambani's then he would be perpetually clowned by everyone especially MI fans, him coming in Wankhede as opposition player would be his worst nightmare.
