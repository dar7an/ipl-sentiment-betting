Rock hard pitch, but not dry. 60m on one side and 75m on the other, 77m straight.

A lot for steamers, not a lot for spinners.

Super high humidity so expect a ton of dew.

Considering all that, win toss, chase, win. Or be like Hyderabad in Q1, win toss, bat first, fold cheaply against Boult cos it's a seamers pitch, lose.",2

2024-05-24T13:27:10+00:00,"Can't believe people were calling Parag a nepotism baby. Yeah, his uncle might be a part owner of RR but that doesn't mean he isn't legitimately talented. Firstly he's a U19 player. Money alone can't get you there.

Secondly, do you think Parag will be bid by other teams if he's in the auction? Of course. Teams like GT and PBKS will give up anything to get a middle order player like him.

Now ask the same question about Arjun Tendulkar. Will any team be interested in buying him aside from MI?",3

With dew in the second inning and their spin attack not being that great, they need to give their bowlers a cushion of extra runs to defend. They also need to try something new when they come to bowl. If they put up a big total, the pressure will be on RR, as they will have to attack throughout the entire inning, creating chances for wickets. RR doesn't have a deep batting lineup after Ashwin, and the batting form of a few RR players isn't that great, although they are capable enough to pull it off. Therefore, SRH should focus on putting up a big total.",8

I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with the SRH CAMP. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to CUMMINS. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",6

I won't comment much on his captaincy decisions cause I have no clarity who decides what between Sanju and Sanga. But the decisions themselves have been mediocre too and the thing that's infuriating is that they have been doing the same old mistakes in the last 3 seasons - no 6th bowling option, backing Ashwin's batting over regular batters, lack of ARs, etc. 

The squad is actually the best squad in the whole cycle which makes it such a shame that they are gona end up with nothing to show for in the trophy cabinet.
