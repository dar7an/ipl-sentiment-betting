With dew in the second inning and their spin attack not being that great, they need to give their bowlers a cushion of extra runs to defend. They also need to try something new when they come to bowl. If they put up a big total, the pressure will be on RR, as they will have to attack throughout the entire inning, creating chances for wickets. RR doesn't have a deep batting lineup after Ashwin, and the batting form of a few RR players isn't that great, although they are capable enough to pull it off.

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to CUMMINS. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.

I won't comment much on his captaincy decisions cause I have no clarity who decides what between Sanju and Sanga. But the decisions themselves have been mediocre too and the thing that's infuriating is that they have been doing the same old mistakes in the last 3 seasons - no 6th bowling option, backing Ashwin's batting over regular batters, lack of ARs, etc. 

The squad is actually the best squad in the whole cycle which makes it such a shame that they are gona end up with nothing to show for in the trophy cabinet.
