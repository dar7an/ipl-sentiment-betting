2024-03-23T13:09:16+00:00,thepokemonchef,"Serious question: Why isn't Shreyas Iyer hyped more?

 Just 4 months ago, he played [one of the best WC knockout innings of all time](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/india-vs-new-zealand-1st-semi-final-1384437/full-scorecard). Just because he failed in the final and India lost, he's not as hyped. People only remember him for being bad at facing the short ball or always being injured.",6
