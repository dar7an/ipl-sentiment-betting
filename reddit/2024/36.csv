But, it’s a subcontinent problem. RCB has more fans than let’s say RR, so you’ll see more toxicity in total from RCB. Just like how india has more population than Australia so you’ll see more toxicity from Indian fans than Aussie.    

Indian fans abused Dhoni and burnt effigies. Indians created an uproar when Harbhajan posed for an ad with a groomed/shaved beard. Indians pelted stones at ICT homes. Indians trolled Bumrah saying he only shows up for IPL and not for “National duty” (cringe). Indians are booing hardik left-right knowing we don’t have a single replacement for him, especially with what mugs our ICT pacers are with the bat. Dhoni fans act crazy on SM. They booed Jadeja and cheered for him to get out last year. Some Rohit stans are mad on Twitter, putting “Chokli” down every opportunity they get.

This is specific to IPL. IPL 2024 is nothing but brain dead cricket. Absolutely waste.

Case in point - Will Jacks getting out and then that ridiculous shot from Pattidar. RCB needed under 10 runs per over. They lost a wicket in that very over. 

The game was with them. Then Cam Green comes in and tries to smack every ball and gets out. Sends in Lomror who doesn't last either. 

Now they have exposed their entire batting and finisher DK. They might still win this, but this is brain dead cricket.
