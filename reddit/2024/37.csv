No, because then, the anchors at the top would probably cruise along nicely for the Titans to end up at 180-odd, which will then be easily chased down.

Anchors in a batting order therefore, should be few, and heavily relied upon only when the team is already in trouble, or when chasing low scores on tough pitches. This might seem 'cheap', but to win in modern T20 cricket, this is probably the best way.",1

Fuck defensive technique, strike rotation, game management, risk assessment, running between the wickets etc. A guy like Kohli is just an ordinary IPL player now because he's only being tested in one facet of the game: hitting. He's trained all his life to be a top all round player, as do most guys like Gill, Rahul etc, players who people call anchors.
