I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Ashutosh. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",7

No, because then, the anchors at the top would probably cruise along nicely for the Titans to end up at 180-odd, which will then be easily chased down.

Anchors in a batting order therefore, should be few, and heavily relied upon only when the team is already in trouble, or when chasing low scores on tough pitches. This might seem 'cheap', but to win in modern T20 cricket, this is probably the best way.",1

Fuck defensive technique, strike rotation, game management, risk assessment, running between the wickets etc. A guy like Kohli is just an ordinary IPL player now because he's only being tested in one facet of the game: hitting. He's trained all his life to be a top all round player, as do most guys like Gill, Rahul etc, players who people call anchors. Soon they won't be able to compete with guys like Fraser McGurk who have optimised their technique for only one thing all their lives. That's why pitches like these are refreshing.",2

2024-04-21T17:40:47+00:00,"Those who are saying Arsh had 2 overs left, blud has been very ordinary and Harshal has been way better than him in past 2-3 games. So obviously, Harshal, Rabada and the spinners were the better choices. Unfortunately, that Rabada over cost us. So done with this shit team.",7

2024-04-21T17:43:00+00:00,Preity simply got jealous of Curran looking so young all the time so she made him the captain to make sure he ages into an old man due to all the stress captaining this team is going to give him,16

2024-04-21T17:46:17+00:00,"Why was the guy whose pen Gill stole, wearing 2 pairs of glasses tho??? One wearing properly and the other tucked into his hair.",5
2024-04-21T17:46:32+00:00,Purists on this sub who do fake outrage that every game goes beyond 200 will conveniently ignore this game and many such other low scoring games this season,16
2024-04-21T17:47:20+00:00,RCB taking consecutive L's,3

2024-04-21T20:27:08+00:00,So the match went on till the last over,6
2024-04-21T23:52:42+00:00,Let us have some more matches that like that. I want that some matches are this low scoring but they go down to the last ball as well.,2
2024-04-22T00:06:36+00:00,Seems like PBKS is trying to achieve record last over losses in IPL. It‚Äôs more likely than qualifying for playoffs!,8
