4. RCB must also defeat CSK by a margin of 40 runs in their next game. 

5. The smaller RCB's victory margin today, the larger it must be against CSK.

2024-05-12T16:45:10+00:00,"Long ago, during the Vedic times, Kauravas was playing it's first unofficial test match against the Pandavas. The match was going in Kaurava's favour but everything changed when a Challenger from Bangalore came into bowling for the Kauravas.The Challenger from Bangalore started choking.

Panadavas was surprised and happy, it helped them so much that they vowed to add the Challenger from Bangalore into their Royal family, so they gave him their own very special and unique name - ROYAL CHALLENGER. Now, after 5000 years of that legendary match, Royal Challengers are regarded as the a GODS of choking by Hindus throughout the world.

As a religious man, I would like to end my legendary tale on the The Challenger of Bangalore and thank all cricket fans for this beautiful opportunity, Long Live The Royal Challenger.",1
2024-05-12T16:45:10+00:00,"RCB got a great start while batting they messed the finishing. RCB got a great start with the ball, and they are struggling to finish.
