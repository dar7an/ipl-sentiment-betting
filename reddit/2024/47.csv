1. Didn't play at home in first half

2. Injury to key players throughout the tournament

3. Bottom of the table just a few matches ago

4.  Panty coming back from that crash

5. Panty's captaincy

And now playing back to back matches with just 1 day rest and travelling over 2k km in between .... we are still alive in the tournament. In fact, we can do the funniest thing if we win tonight...we will be 2nd on the table. Lezooooooooooo",10

On the other hand Sanju has shown nothing else but class in this year's IPL. 

If we had to take one of the two to the T20 WC, till today I was on the fence but now my vote is definitely for Sanju. Sanju may not have shown us great results in T20Is so far but he sure has shown enough potential - he can bat sensibly when things are tricky and very well knows how to change gears.
