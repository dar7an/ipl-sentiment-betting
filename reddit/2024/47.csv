3. Bottom of the table just a few matches ago

4.  Panty coming back from that crash

5. Panty's captaincy

And now playing back to back matches with just 1 day rest and travelling over 2k km in between .... we are still alive in the tournament. In fact, we can do the funniest thing if we win tonight...we will be 2nd on the table. Lezooooooooooo",10

2024-04-29T15:58:09+00:00,Algaav_wadi,"In a way a good game where Pant had an opportunity to show us that he could play decently when ball is doing something but he was exposed heavily - if he had decided to bat sensibly (and not slog mindlessly) DC might have reached closer to 180 and that seems like a decent score to defend on this pitch (so far).

On the other hand Sanju has shown nothing else but class in this year's IPL. 

If we had to take one of the two to the T20 WC, till today I was on the fence but now my vote is definitely for Sanju. Sanju may not have shown us great results in T20Is so far but he sure has shown enough potential - he can bat sensibly when things are tricky and very well knows how to change gears. Pant, on the other hand gets exposed against good bowling (game against SRH) or tricky tracks.",16
