He hasn't played any competitive cricket since February.

The guy bowled reasonably well in the powerplay last year. 0/17(2.0) vKKR 1/18(2.5) vSRH, and 1/9(2.0) vGT with one terrible match against PBKS 1/48(3.0)

Those are respectable numbers for anyone. And his Domestic T20 strike rate is 14.8 ^(which is better than Mukesh Kumar, Arshdeep, Avesh, Harshal Patel, Chetan Sakariya, T Natarajan, Khaleel, N Saini, D Chahar, all whom have debuted for India)

Yes, his stats are on a small sample size, but ffs, they're completely fine, and _technically_ better than every fast bowler who's debuted for India in the last 5 years at least. I'm not saying he's at the level of Natarajan, Arshdeep or any of them.

But chill the fuck out with the nepotism claims. What you're saying is basically **""He doesn't deserve to play because his father is a legend, unlike other player"".** And you guys wonder why a few players take mental health breaks.",1

2024-05-17T15:41:17+00:00,WayToTheDawn63,"In potential defense of Rahul, LSG's batting overall isn't very deep, which kind of demands someone consistent. There's only a couple of bats on the team with the potential to go huge, and only 1 with any consistency. 

Rahul doesn't attack the power play well, but he does milk the middle overs and rotate well, accelerating if he lasts long enough. Usually he plays a run a ball until 'fixing it' to a 130-150 later on, this would actually be okay if you've got a pooran at the other side all the time. If you were building a team and HAD to have Rahul, aggressive openers and Rahul coming in when there's a collapse or just outside the power play would probably be the best use of him.",6

Stoinis has also been inconsistent but he's a matchwinner when he clicks. Even if KL isn't released, they need to build a better top order around KL and Stoinis. They'd likely want to push Badoni at 4 and back him there, which means Stoinis plays at 3. If KL is going to accumulate in the powerplay, they need someone that hits hard and from ball 1 to support him and not QdK with whatever he has been doing. Nicky P at 5 and Krunal at 7 are fine.",5

The fact that he's arrogant enough that outside noise has genuinely never affected him, his non-fear of failure, is what makes him such an asset in crunch situations. With the fear of failure now making him overthink his game, he has lost his confidence in what he truly does well. 

So many times he was trying that slower wide one with the ball, when it's a known fact that he's at his best when he's clicking 140 at length/back of length.

With the bat he's trying shots he doesn't really play too often with no zeal.",10

2024-05-17T19:13:13+00:00,javapyscript,Pooran is such a humble character. You could see in his eyes though that he knew he could have batter higher!,14
2024-05-17T19:14:35+00:00,ihateallmoney,I think Pooran performed specifically better and had a certain kind of attitude to ensure he’s at the helm for next season given KL’s departure,15

2024-05-17T19:18:46+00:00,trkora,"It's a shame, MI had won a lot by 2020 that I was fine with MI not winning it for couple of years and seeing others win. CSK were 3, MI had 5, we were that ahead.

2021 and 2022 were fine, 2023 did not expect that team to make it as far as it did. After end of 2023 season, 2024 is the time when I felt it's time for MI to win again and that's when MI had its worst season. 

Looking forward to the next season, it's not gonna be easy but anything is better than what happened this season.",5
2024-05-17T19:19:08+00:00,benguins10,"I left when they were 90 in 9 overs with brohit and sky playing, how did MI lose this damn. Pandya form really concerning, hoping he clutches up when needed as he's done in the past for India. Glad Rohit showed a glimpse of what we hope to see in the WC as well.",9

2024-05-17T19:36:58+00:00,sinesquaredtheta,"The best part has gotta be Hardik's statement on it being ""Too early to point out exactly what went wrong"". 

My man, the game is over and the season is done and dusted! Are you planning on trying to understand what went wrong this IPL sometime in 2025 😂",26

2024-05-17T19:45:29+00:00,ThatOxyMoron,Is Tendulkar the best 30 lacs MI can spend? I understand why he is there but what a joke when there are likely much deserving talent waiting to be looked at.,10
