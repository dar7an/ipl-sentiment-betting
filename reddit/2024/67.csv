Those are respectable numbers for anyone. And his Domestic T20 strike rate is 14.8 ^(which is better than Mukesh Kumar, Arshdeep, Avesh, Harshal Patel, Chetan Sakariya, T Natarajan, Khaleel, N Saini, D Chahar, all whom have debuted for India)

Yes, his stats are on a small sample size, but ffs, they're completely fine, and _technically_ better than every fast bowler who's debuted for India in the last 5 years at least. I'm not saying he's at the level of Natarajan, Arshdeep or any of them.

Rahul doesn't attack the power play well, but he does milk the middle overs and rotate well, accelerating if he lasts long enough. Usually he plays a run a ball until 'fixing it' to a 130-150 later on, this would actually be okay if you've got a pooran at the other side all the time. If you were building a team and HAD to have Rahul, aggressive openers and Rahul coming in when there's a collapse or just outside the power play would probably be the best use of him.",6
