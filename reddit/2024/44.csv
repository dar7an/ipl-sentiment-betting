2024-04-27T13:22:56+00:00,A 6 point lead over the second placed team sounds too good to be true. I worry we are taking the L today boys,5

2024-04-27T13:38:48+00:00,So RR make the only man who can give them an over the impact.,4

2024-04-27T13:43:05+00:00,RR Bros you have scammed us with DDP give us 2 points as a good will gesture.,6

Why would you be so delicately looked after otherwise, it's the IPL and it's your debut season, you would run yourself into the ground to make as much of an impact as you can, what other cricket would you have ahead of you that's more important?",4

The organizers would've made a conscious effort to give more bang for the buck to the audience, more sixes and fours during a game, so the audience can wave them flags that were sold to them more often, twice an over or something.

They want the matches to last longer purely for economic reasons. They have like 25k to 50k people at any given venue. They want them to be there longer, so they can get them to spend more at the venue(s). Low-scoring games that end early, with boring defensive cricket on display, where bowlers come out of top doesn't help sales and commerce.  This is like a big party for the audience, they want to dance every over, celebrate every boundary/six.

It's commercial entertainment. they want to pack more action in 40 over bandwidth they're working with. More runs per game was a no-brainer, to get more leverage out of the audience.

IPL is a good example of how economics can influence the evolution of a given sport.

2024-04-27T16:33:36+00:00,"Unrelated but, I slept and wanna know how everyone’s views were

Hardik Pandya | MI Captain: This game is becoming more and more closer. It (the difference) used to be a couple of overs, now it’s becoming a couple of balls. Because of the kind of games and how the bowlers are under pressure, we backed ourselves to do it. If I had to pick something out, we could have taken a couple of more chances in the middle overs. The left-handers could have probably gone after Axar a little bit, it’s something we missed out in terms of game awareness. It was quite amazing the way he (Fraser-McGurk) batted, he took calculated risks, he played the field really well. It shows the fearlessness of youth. (If he would’ve done something different at the toss) Not really.

Left handers he mean Tilak? Shame that’s some shit to say. Didn’t even appreciate his effort",10

2024-04-27T17:16:29+00:00,"Here’s my intrusive thought and I wanna say it out loud:

If ICC = BCCI and in that case if BCCI is going to prepare pitches in the upcoming T20WC, they’ll probably make it as flat as this year’s IPL since that is all Indian batters would’ve been practicing for 2.5 months just before WC begins. Why would they give their batters a road in the IPL and slow, sluggish, spin tracks in the WC. Should we expect 220+ games in the WC too?

Again, this is just an intrusive thought far from any reality and I just wanted to say it out loud",-1

2024-04-27T17:32:35+00:00,RR paced their innings according to target... They would have chased even 220 here,3
