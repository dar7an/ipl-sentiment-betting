Rohit outsmarted a marauding Bazball team and destroyed them after a whole bunch of English media hype. Give the man his due recognition ffs.

2024-03-27T15:55:30+00:00,officiallyjax,That disastrous 2022 mega-auction has hurt us so much the impact still remains. The bowling attack has never collectively been good enough since then. We've been a bit unlucky with injuries to our overseas left-arm quicks but the spin department is still so subpar when you compare it to the other teams in the IPL. Piyush Chawla should be enjoying his retirement and we've brought him back for yet another graveyard shift.,3

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin b0ner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",8

Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and GOAT of T20 Klassen no words for these guys. They were absolutely phenomenal. 277 in T20? Wonder was I watching Cricket 07 on easy mode?

They bowled slow balls almost exclusively at the back end. Tim and Hardik didn't adapt and wait for the ball and play their shots, they obviously have the power to clear the boundary, and instead just tried to play for faster bowling. Tim didn't even move to the off side when they were bowling on the off side, away from his preferred arc.",4
