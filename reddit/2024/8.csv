Rohit won FIVE IPLs and people said it doesn't count because MI are the best team. They just became even better, and yet look at the results. Rohit won ten games in a row in the WC. Rohit outsmarted a marauding Bazball team and destroyed them after a whole bunch of English media hype. Give the man his due recognition ffs. He's not good enough as a batter for the upcoming WC, but let's be grateful for what we have and not expect Thala every single time.

This will go down in history as the match in which only Bumrah with a 'respectable' 9 rpo had an economy under 10. It will go down as a game which few would forget. Remember, Coetzee and Bumrah prevented what could've been the IPL's first three hundred plus total — and Hyderabad have just achieved a cheat code of sorts in terms of NRR. So bring on Cummins' boys — as their carnage echoes in the streets of Hyderabad.

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin b0ner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",8

Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and GOAT of T20 Klassen no words for these guys. They were absolutely phenomenal. 277 in T20? Wonder was I watching Cricket 07 on easy mode? 

Crazy just crazy! I am starting to like SRH now, they do have potential to win the trophy.",29

They bowled slow balls almost exclusively at the back end. Tim and Hardik didn't adapt and wait for the ball and play their shots, they obviously have the power to clear the boundary, and instead just tried to play for faster bowling. Tim didn't even move to the off side when they were bowling on the off side, away from his preferred arc.",4
