In comparison, Kohli lunges forward and goes with his hands and looks to manipulate the balls into gaps. If he gets a really bad ball he will try and hit it for a boundary.

Just Virat remembered his batting form in 2016 and hit all yorkers for fours in Gap.

I think pitch is slow and an out of Form batting line up of RR cant chase this.

Avesh should not be dishearten by it, he bowled well, it just shows T20 is a cruel game and numbers do not show the half truth.

From my scientific research, I have established that there are in fact 3 different Buttlers:

Jos Buttler - One of the world's most destructive white ball batsmen, can win games singlehandedly, but only when his team loses the toss. 

Toss Buttler - This guy rocks up whenever Buttler's team wins the toss and isn't nearly as good as Jos. Legit, the disparity between his stats when winning and losing the toss is pretty significant, especially in ODIs.

Yos Buttler - Very rare, only ever sighted in the Netherlands. Still yet to be dismissed, and strikes at 185.",7

He set a platform for others to get 30(10), 24(7), 12(4) etc - but no one did. 

Anyway, now I have finished dickriding, if RCB lose (as I write this now RR are 54-1 from 6 overs) all of the criticism, blame and scrutiny will go on Kohli.

Virat will never get out which means.. it will be too late for others.. and they will get out.

2) Green should bat at No. 3 and Maxwell should come in at No. 6

3) They need a somewhat consistent middle order batsman and it sucks that they haven't groomed any domestic player to do that job all these years
