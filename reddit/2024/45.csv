2024-04-28T10:43:20+00:00,GT went from the most exciting franchise to the most boring in the matter of 1 season,10
2024-04-28T10:43:24+00:00,"For all the flak Sai gets, he's not been utterly terrible. GT in general have had a weird mixed bag season. It doesn't help that he's not the most flashy or exciting batsman, and GT needs him paired with someone who can get the score ticking. Him and Gill together can kill momentum",9
2024-04-28T10:43:24+00:00,"Guys, last night I heard a prophecy in my dreams.

It‚Äôs where the bulk of the runs need to be scored to take an unassailable lead in the game. Faf & Kohli are just not it. And they are our most experienced players who can consolidate on rapid starts from the openers. 

I would honestly put: 

1. Jacks 

2. Green (intent version) / Maxwell 

3. Faf 

4. Kohli (can play anchor, flexible depending on need) 

5. Green / Maxwell (spin bashing version) 

6. Patidar (spin basher)

Basically try to find the maximum amount of power while keeping the shortest stroke possible. This ultimately puts a ceiling on the amount of power that can be generated but allows you to stay in control. The hitters basically do not hesitate to use a full shoulder turn and make no attempt to keep the stroke small. This means maximum power, but if the ball does anything unexpected, they will lose control.

2024-04-28T13:04:08+00:00," Things are made out to be so binary... As one of the most skilled batters on earth, and having set high standards, Koach naturally has high expectations of him. He's struggled a bit with intent and mindset this season, and in recent years, and has not broken free like he potentially can against spin. I think it's fair to say that, and while this innings is good, hope he sustains a positive approach. 

At the same time, it's also a bit early to say he's washed and over etc when he's piling on runs at a good clip against pace. That will still be useful, especially on pitches that aren't made of glazed concrete. He's also still got the hunger for runs and winning... And has shown he can step it up. Definitely more a mental switch than skill. Given its pretty much a given that he's playing the WC, I hope he makes the switch. We won't survive the WC with our conservative approach... And the switch becomes hard when it's not natural",13
