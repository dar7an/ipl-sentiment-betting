I respect Jaiswal and Buttler greatly, but the lack of attacking the power play no matter how apparently slow the wicket is just bad. 

T20s are evolving. Losing power play wickets is mattering less and less if they've attacked up front. Fully expect CSK to take a chunk out of this chase up front if Ravindra can connect with the ball. 

Hate to overhype the kid when it's not a DC game, but if Mcgurk was playing here and had a decent game, he might make you 40 from 20 on a slow wicket anyway, and let everyone else pace their innings outside of the power play.

3. Playing with a 1 batter less while batting first, causes everyone to bat too conservatively

Ashwin + Chahal + Maharaj would have been great for middle overs spin choke and wickets. Boult, Sandeep, and Avesh would have been enough for the initial powerplay and death

2024-05-12T13:27:48+00:00,kukdukdu,For those saying the ball may have missed the stumps or Jadeja had already moved in line of stumps before throw was made. Go and check why this rule came into existence. This wasn‚Äôt an obs few years ago. But batsmen intentionally used to run in middle of the stumps to remove the sight of stumps from fielder if they knew they can‚Äôt reach the stumps in time. This is exactly the reason why this kind of obs was introduced. This is probably the most correct usage of the rule for which it was made!,14
