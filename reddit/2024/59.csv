In 2012 Dhoni criticized Sehwag (Yes the guy who went bald and planted hair back)for being slow in the field. And now its Mitchell's turn. The only non bald player Dhoni hates is Harbhajan singh, who expressed his criticism of dhoni for throwing him out of team unreasonably after 2011 when he had 400+ wickets. And guess what, this guy wears a turban to cover his hair, so he is technically bald. The breadcrumbs are endless, this isn't just a conspiracy.

Unreal passion from CSK fans after the victory, they are one of the most passionate fans of the sport. They were really jubilant after the win........... Wait hold on...

They.... Lost??",33
2024-05-10T18:12:08+00:00,Dhoni haters are really very cringe and stupid. Blaming Dhoni for the loss when it was the batters before him. Had he played tuk.tuk then also they would've criticised him for not caring about NRR.,-22

2024-05-10T18:18:40+00:00,"Honestly happy with today's performance. We bowled really well at the death and to come back strong after that freak start was impressive. like gaik said what let us down today was our fielding. We should have been chasing 210 instead of 230 and who knows we might have won. Confident we can beat RR on home turf. Those lot can go and win their last 2 home games. I think we sneak in, come back here in the eliminator, win that shit and win 2 at home for a 6th.


Well a guy can dream at least. Cheers guys. Don't take this shit too seriously. It's just sport. Whoever wins at the end deserves it.",2

LSG will reach the playoffs thanks to CSK, RCB and DC destroying each other. They absolutely dominate eliminator and Qualifier-2. In Finals, they get KKR all out for 50 (with regards to RCB from Jay Shah) and then KL will run out everyone in his team before getting himself out hit wicket. As everyone gets shellshocked, suddenly all the lights in the stadium go out. When they come back on, KL will be standing in the middle of pitch with Sanjeev Goenka lying down unmoving and KL making the iconic Undertaker pose.",32
2024-05-10T18:21:17+00:00,"What's with all the comments assuming as if RCB is through the playoffs now... Even with CSK lose today, there are still three teams ahead of RCB and better contenders for the playoff race - CSK, DC and LSG. Not only are you expecting RCB to win all the remaining two matches, you are also assuming that these other three teams will not be able to win the remaining two matches even after performing much better than RCB throughout the season.

He did something unimaginable by winning 3 ICC trophies and that's all the common man cares about.

In a country obsessed with heroes (not just in Cricket, in fact sports icons are nothing compared to politicians and filmstars), there will always be stuff happening like this cause it's cultural.",24
