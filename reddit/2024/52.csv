The fixed purse rule in IPL keeps such parity between teams that every match is even and fun, which is sorely missing in international cricket. Also there are so many different players you get to watch in IPL every year vs international cricket where it's the same guys over and over again. International T20 cricket is fine for world cups, but IPL is  superior to bilaterals, despite crap rules like Impact sub and flat pitches.

It's an environment with the lowest of expectations upon you allowing you plenty of time and room to make mistakes, learn and grow, no doubt helped by the fact that the whole mission of the franchise ends at the ""Batsmen win you sponsorships"" part of the famous line thrown around here often.",43
2024-05-04T18:20:23+00:00,subashj24,One match everyone criticises about all match going above 200 and since then only one match has gone above 200. STRANGE!!!,39
2024-05-05T00:25:18+00:00,SBG99DesiMonster,I just remembered that Rashid has had a major surgery not very long back. I think that he hasn't played after that surgery and prior to the IPL. This might be the reason that he has underperformed so badly. Bowlers that get major surgeries usually struggle to get into the rhythm that were in during the initial weeks after that.,4
