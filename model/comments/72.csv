Today is the day he cements to the casuals on how he should be respected and credited as a genuine India player. And how he should be in the conversation and should be a regular in the Indian side. 

He has to take this on and make sure he takes his side home. Otherwise this is again a forgetful season for RR no matter how good and balanced they are. And a forgetful season for him no matter how talented and complete as a batter he seems. 

The greats make their names on days like these. Too many of us Sanju believers feel he is hard done when it comes to team India selection and his overall appreciation. But if you don‚Äôt pull through on big days like these, you won‚Äôt ever get it. You have to force and kill your way through and win these situations if you want to level up. 

Sanju‚Äôs career is at an inflection point. He has been around for a while. He has been considered a talent for a while. He has been snubbed for a while. Now he is at the age, that if he doesn‚Äôt perform and produce on the day off, it is over.",5

2024-05-22 08:48:22 PM IST,"Yes and it caused such a massive buildup of calcium in his bones that throughout most of his career there was a weak affinity between his bones and trace amounts of calcium carbonate in the stumps. So he was able to electromagnetically 'anchor' himself to the stumps while batting and play those helicopter shots that should be impossible for mere mortals. This also explains his insane speed behind the stumps. He is already attracted to them in the first place, so he is able to execute stumpings at unbelievable speeds.

Over the last decade his body has slowly metabolised the calcium deposits he was able to accumulate while drinking six litres of milk per day and now his calcium levels are returning to normal. That is why he's unable to hit as far as he used to, and if he keeps playing we will see him get slower behind the stumps.

This is all because of inflation. The government could have subsidised milk for Dhoni, but they did not. Blame the government. Dhoni could have been a God among men, but now that will never come to pass.",2

2024-05-22 09:58:36 PM IST,"Indian bowlers lack sentience in this format. It's thoroughly disappointing but a feature of their bowling in T20Is also. Only Bumrah and Arshdeep really have the brains. Shami and Bhuvi survived on their elite longer-format skills which is what kept them relevant for cups but also highly disposable when it was clear their time was over

Siraj at his best in T20s will not be fit to polish the boots of the likes of Starc, Shaheen, Hazlewood, Bumrah playing with active niggles at bowling in the late 130s

So fucking tired of watching the guy for the last 7 years bowl like a clueless moron with his lengths in T20s. He lacks any natural affinity for this format; everyone knows they can go after him regardless of length once he is hit for two boundaries, even if he gives 120% of his all for the next 20 balls of his quota

Comfortably loosened the game. Instead of investing in an inconsistent core clown in Maxwell and the ilk, thus having neither batting nor bowling, release clowns like Siraj aim to actually develop your bowling core, RCB. Dayal and Siraj are C+ tier T20 bowlers. Will you ever learn RCB? IPL has always lacked enough quality bowlers especially after expansion to 10 teams; shoud have poached them when you could have at the mega auction",7

I can see a RCB fan cry for 24 Hours straight and feel no remorse whatsoever. They aren't any better in real life as well. Their subreddit is the ultimate cancer on reddit and needs to be deleted asap. That shithole is worse than anything present on this platform. Their constant yapping on Twitter and Instagram and their constant death threats to players of other teams and their own team as well is well known around the community.

The reality is Riyan Parag's 90% fanbase is filled with teenage girls adoring his boy next door looks. Only 10% of them care about his stats. Dhruv Jurel is somewhere in between with an even split of insufferable teenage girls and veteran cricket fans who appreciate his rugged, manly, *old spice* personality.

On the other hand, nobody can match up to the religious worship and fervour Ash Anna receives from us mortals. If people fall for Parag's sex appeal and Jurel's effortless masculinity, it is Anna's enlightenment, tranquility, and relentless spirituality that attracts us Test match purists. Anna need only beat the batters outside edge for us to marvel at his poise and grace.",13

I can see a RCB fan cry for 24 Hours straight and feel no remorse whatsoever. They aren't any better in real life as well. Their subreddit is the ultimate cancer on reddit and needs to be deleted asap. That shithole is worse than anything present on this platform. Their constant yapping on Twitter and Instagram and their constant death threats to players of other teams and their own team as well is well known around the community. Dear God make them suffer in the worst way that is known to you and bring sanity and peace to our world.,4

2024-05-23 12:07:56 AM IST,"Ronaldo type characters are all needed for the teams. Virat in aggressive mode is beauty & the beast. But there is a fine line between aggression and playing hard. Abusing JFM, Rachin or any young batter playing well when he is himself not the bowler or runout fielder doesn't look good. RCB fans should realise aggression only looks good when the other team is silent type. If the other teams also start behaving the same way then it could become Pollard vs Starc or Naveen/Gambhir situation.",23
2024-05-23 12:08:00 AM IST,"Now RCB fans with a population of rats will try to downvote anything that criticizes RCB. I can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs all okay when they bully other teams and fans, but when anyone else does the same, they go berserk.",43

2024-05-23 12:17:48 AM IST,"Still they had a great run, You can hate them because of their fans and Kohli's aggresive attitude but they made comeback from losing 5 straight and then they lost by one single run,From there on no other team would've dared to even think of making it to playoffs, hell lsg,dc,gt despite being in better position gave up before their last two matches, csk and rcb were last men standing fought well, and even today rcb did amazing, they weren't favourites to begin with, it was sheer will and determination to fight for self respect.

RR on the other hand gotta love them too, at start they did same as rcb did in end and their later half was same as rcb's first half.",2

RCB can celebrate as much as they want after winning the match, but roaring at every single wicket shows the respect they don't have against their opponents. It's a contest between bat and ball, not a sparring contest.",28

2024-05-23 01:09:45 AM IST,"All that pelvic thrusting, silencing crowds, fighting with commentators, abusing young players gonna turn into memes. It all looks aggressive until you lose. I could never imagine any other ipl team or int player doing these things even before winning in finals. Don't know what they will do if they win the trophy eventually.",42
2024-05-23 01:32:33 AM IST,I now realize how English and Australian fans must be getting irritated with Kohli being a prick on the field when he plays in the opposite team. Celebrating wickets is one thing but constantly being in the face of the opposition can be fckin annoying,35
