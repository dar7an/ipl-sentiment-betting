2024-04-16 07:25:10 PM IST,"Man, RR is really suffering from problem of plenty.
They surely would want Burger in the team when he is fit, but he would keep Butler out of team, which any sane team would not want.


But keeping burger out leaves RR with merely five bowlers, with Sen , Avesh and Ashwin anyone can have bad day and their whole plan would collapse.


They are essentially beginning with merely five bowlers, a strategy I never consider safe in T20s.


And why is Maharaj suddenly out if contention when Ashwin overall has been average this season?


Man, RR have great team but as they say too many cooks spoil the fish, they can have all their plans jumbled. They definitely are treading a thin line",2

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possible.

The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him.

After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. 

After two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Royal Challenger Bengaluru, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone!",11

You can't drop a person who's performing at the pinnacle in international cricket on the basis of a domestic tournament.

Im not sure if the message in the camp is to swing at every ball but he already had 11 runs that over not sure why he wanted to heave it. should have recognized that the bowler is finding swing.

2024-04-16 10:21:54 PM IST,"Why do the purists on this sub hate  watch T20 leagues when T20 Internationals are way different from T20 leagues and get upset when 200+ runs are scored frequently 

Why hate watch something that you don't like you aren't even the target audience of this league?

Just turn off the TV when you feel if the game isn't for you 

Or do most people here don't actually watch the games and just make their opinions on the basis of scorecards 

Salt and Russell two intent merchants made 23 off 23 Iyer made 11 off 7 so they all made 34 off 30 

So the whole why not use a bowling machine arguments are stupid

Rinku also didn't look in full flow today and Narine slowed after his 100 he made 9 off his next 7 balls
So that's 41 off 37, Venky made 8 off 6 and Ramandeep scored a single in his only delivery so that's
So that's 50 off 43 which is basically an anchor innings 

RR also gave 21 Extras in this innings 

That's 50 off 43 (71 off 43)

So they basically made 152 off 77 

And it took One of their most in-form batters to bash the two best spinners in the opposition team 

The likelihood of Ashwin and Chahal conceding so many is very rare

So it wasn't as flat as you believe 

Boult also went for 31 in his 4 on this wicket on every flat pitch qualify bowlers like Bumrah, Cummins, Boult, Vaibhav Arora also went for 3-27 in his 4 against DC in Vizag so the whole argument that Not everyone can be Bumrah bro doesn't hold true

Real fact is there isn't enough fast bowling talent in India to cover up 10 teams and the Impact player rule does make a difference but the first point is one of the bigger reasons as to why so many games are low scoring.

Also the lack of Saturday Double Headers also is partially responsible for it

Once all pitches reach 4 to 5 games each they will began to slow down

Tldr: The pitch is flat but isn't a pitch where bowlers have nothing and you can blindly slog and strike at 200+",4

He keeps sucking the momentum of the innings and RR keeps sending him up over and over again. Serves them right for losing today because of this muck up.,7

2024-04-17 12:01:18 AM IST,Narine scored century at 204.08 SR and others scored at 145.31 SR. Buttler scored century at 189.09 SR and others scored at 157.69 SR. Proves that its not always about the individual's Strike rate.,20
2024-04-17 12:01:37 AM IST,"We don't have a reason to panic. We played very well today. Starc should be talked to, whether he's serious or not about playing. We'll come back next game",7

2024-04-17 12:03:19 AM IST,Okay so avesh did not have the helmet with him. That is the reason he did not throw it. Should have taken buttlers helmet and thrown it,8

2024-04-17 12:04:03 AM IST,"All of the great players are open to learning from other players. Hussey said he learnt how to play in Indian conditions by watching Vijay, Badri, Chinna Thala and Thala bat.
Now Jos says he takes inspiration from Dhoni and Kohli on taking the game deep and keep believing.",9
2024-04-17 12:04:24 AM IST,"All we needed was one riyan parag or powell innings against CSK , we would've won. 

Kishan failed , SKY played one of his early duck innings , and Pandya is........... Well Pandya",11
2024-04-17 12:04:31 AM IST,Buttler innings was similar to Koach and Rohit. Lord Avesh was the difference. KKR got scared by the Goat helmet thrower.,13
2024-04-17 12:04:48 AM IST,Rohit should learn from Buttler. Maybe opportunity for him to be Impact sub. The CSK match could have been won,-7

2024-04-17 12:05:22 AM IST,"Anyone else feel that 200+ by teams and centuries by batsmen is getting a bit too frequent these days? And 3 wicket hauls very rare? From Sunday till today we have had 4 centuries. And 206, 287 and 223 runs by teams batting first. It's getting boring now.",15

I like this last over finishes but would really love where bowler drives the game rather then batsman smacking them left and right....",7
2024-04-17 12:12:10 AM IST,I am pretty sure RR has more than 6 fans now,23

Things that should've concerning them 

Ashwin and Yashasvi form

A reliable pacer expect Avesh and Boult

That's it all other things are going fine period...",2
2024-04-17 12:17:11 AM IST,"It's high time people realise that IPL is only for money making (from BCCI's pov) and fun (from audience pov). It doesn't simulate real match tactics. Impact player rule + intentionally smaller boundaries (which are otherwise kept a bit longer for international matches in india) aren't there in intl matches.¬†






IPL is NOT going to prepare India for t20 wcs or anything. In fact, in future we'll be getting even less good players (who can withstand in intl matches) from IPL.",-7
2024-04-17 12:17:29 AM IST,RCB silently brought butler and Narine back to the form and now enjoying the show against other teams..,24
2024-04-17 12:21:30 AM IST,I like how this match isn't even related to RCB in any manner and they still catching strays one of my favourite things about these threads..,15
2024-04-17 12:25:16 AM IST,Just love how RCB finds itself catching strays every damn match where they're not even playing. This time it's to reassure KKR fans to not lose hope because they'll be getting 2 free points from them in their next match lol.,19
2024-04-17 12:26:28 AM IST,Guys what is a good explanation to someone who keeps saying all this is fixed?,3

2024-04-17 12:45:05 AM IST,"I did the math. From 14th over, excluding the balls faced by powell and boult, buttler alone took 70 runs from just 25 balls. That is a strike rate of 350 maintained consistently through those 6 overs. Fooking Legend!",37
2024-04-17 12:55:08 AM IST,"Sanjay one liners in highlights are annoying AF.

But Dayam Buttler played so well.",9
2024-04-17 04:45:50 AM IST,If Avesh is your finisher then you would be winning that match. Helmets might also be getting banged.,8
