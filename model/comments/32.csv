There was gap between bat and pad there, and the UltraEdge confirms Miller got an inside edge. And Pant did well to take that, diving to his left even as the ball was dying on to him. His gloves were on the ground when he took the ball. Ishant bowled on a short of a length again, and this one angled back in from outside off to finish on middle

2024-04-17 08:18:04 PM IST,"So its not IPL as a whole its more certain grounds and the pitches curated to the home team that are producing high scoring matches. RCB, KKR, MI are batting heavy teams compared to bowling so they are going to prepare flat pitches with their batsmen ready. SRH seems to have 4 destructive batsmen who can deal in 6s in small grounds. Its the team makeup and they sacrificed some bowling for that. You're not going to get high scores in ahmedabad because GT depends more on their bowling with the spinners coming into play. I think the horrible balance that certain teams have(MI, RCB => only batting not much bowling) is contributing to the high scores.",2

Shahrukh tried to swipe at this length ball which pitched outside leg, but the ball slid below his bat. He had taken a step or two down the pitch too, and as fortunate as it could get for Pant, the ball dropped off his glove and hit the leg stump. But the third umpire wants to confirm if it is the ball hitting the stumps, or the gloves. The stumps are hit, but it lights up a second or two later. Finally, the third umpire concludes that the ball has hit the stumps cleanly, with Shahrukh's back foot outside the crease. The ball is called wide, but it doesn't matter to DC - they have a wicket!

Collapse, dream lost, season gone stale.

Rashid, a warrior, hero of the game,
Fights with bat and ball, spirit aflame.
Beacon of hope, in dark of night,
