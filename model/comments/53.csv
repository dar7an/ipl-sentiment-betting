And the coin lands on its side! Can you believe it! Ashutosh wins the toss! Wait a minute. Is that.......? Yes it is! Dhoni walks into the ground, just like it's 2019! He is having a heated argument with the match referee Virat Kohli. Reports say that Anushka Sharma is live streaming the incident on her Instagram, victimising Virat Kohli. Virat doesn't allow a re-toss! The eternal commentator Sunny G and 97 man Gautam Gambhir have walked to oppose Kohli. They seem to not care about CSK. Just here to bash Kohli. Ashutosh is declared the toss winner. But there's a twist! Thala denies a choice to Ashutosh Sharma! Just like he used to deny singles to his team mates! And Thala chooses Punjab will have a bowl!

Of course some of us will agree/disagree on who gets more criticism or should get more of it, but 

Somehow Jadeja slips under the radar. He's been there in T20WCs since 2009 and I can't remember a single marquee performance from him, and the sample size is big enough to say that he's not fit for this format unless or course the pitch is like Nagpur 2016. With the bat, even lesser. 

We've not been able to find a 'replacement' for Pandya but what about a replacement for Jadeja? Why is he always starting in his format?",15

Today there were good hands from Mitchell and Thakur, and a very good innings from Jadeja. However, it‚Äôs hard to understand how someone like Thakur can concentrate freely on their batting and the ball that‚Äôs coming, when all that can be heard so loudly are chants of ‚ÄúDHONI, DHONI!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWE WANT DHONI!‚Äù. Surely that does anything but help the batter on strike, and is actually quite a negative distraction. The failure to support the batter on strike, and recognise the issue, speaks to the toxicity of CSK‚Äôs fanbase, which of course was there in large numbers during the innings today. I used to love CSK, especially due to Indian legends like Dhoni and Jadeja, who have won so many games for them. But now having seen the problems with so many of their fans, I am less inclined to do so in the future. This likely won‚Äôt be popular or necessary to say, but just the perspective of an unbiased Indian fan",12

2024-05-05 07:27:48 PM IST,"So to be sure about IPL trophy CSK needs to win 3/4 next 4 games to be in top 4 that to they're dependent on other matchups ..

Then win 3-3 throught to win the IPL trophy and give Thala his farewell ..

They don't have they're primary bowlers Parthirana , Fizz and Deepak

They're batting is over dependent on Dube and Rutu

Jadeja and spinners has been hot and cold entire season

Most important toss luck is not with them

If they win it from here it will be one of the best comeback for IPL team......",19

2024-05-05 08:28:50 PM IST,"Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there was a rumor that Gautam Gambhir had made a bet with the Cheshire Cat from Wonderland. The wager? Who could keep a straight face the longest. The Cheshire Cat, known for its mischievous grin, was confident it would win. However, Gambhir, with his legendary poker face, took the challenge seriously. Days turned into weeks, and neither of them showed a hint of a smile. As the contest continued, Gambhir's expression became so fixed that even when he tried to smile, his face refused to cooperate, having forgotten how! And so, the legend goes, Gambhir never smiles not because he's grumpy, but because he's still trying to win that bet with the Cheshire Cat, who, rumor has it, is still grinning somewhere in Wonderland.",5

2024-05-05 08:31:26 PM IST,Does Rututaj's reluctance to use spin bother you? Santer bowled so well but got moved when the right handers got out (matchups are so overrated imo). Thought he will use Moeen to Brar and Curran but no. Man has been great woth bowling changes and seems to have a good head on his shoulders but his reluctance with spinners troubles me.,8
2024-05-05 08:31:27 PM IST,"In the mystical world of cricket, there's a little-known secret behind Sunil Narine's exceptional performance as a batsman in the IPL. It is said that Narine stumbled upon a magical cricket bat hidden within the depths of Eden Gardens. This bat, crafted from the legendary Crickethor tree, was enchanted by a cricket-loving wizard. The wizard, a fan of twists and turns, cast a spell that would only activate when the bat was wielded by a bowler rather than a batsman. As fate would have it, Narine, primarily known for his spin bowling, decided to give batting a go and the bat sprang to life! With each swing, the bat guides the ball to the boundary with the precision of a homing missile. And so, Narine's unexpected batting prowess continues to baffle opponents and spectators alike, all thanks to a whimsical wizard's love for a good surprise in the game.",6
