2024-05-06 06:53:07 PM IST,"Umran and Tripathi have to play.

A bowler like Umran will do WAY better on the Wankhede surface than Unadkat. Kishan and Hardik hate express pace.

Our number 3 has been our weakest link. Tripathi has a great record against MI, especially Bumrah. Yes, he's a little weak against spin but MI doesn't have good spinners.",4

RR wins next 3 matches.

MI helped SRH in 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2022 by resting key players and/or beating teams that were threatening SRH. SRH helped MI in 2021, and 2023 by doing the same.

England, South Africa and West Indies have proper t20 teams but they are not talked about as much as Australia, especially considering t20 is not the strongest suit of Australia.

2024-05-06 07:53:53 PM IST,Bumrah should be given some special assistance ike personal doctor therapist everything by bcci all the time,3
2024-05-06 07:53:55 PM IST,"I wonder if Bumrah is thinking of participating  in the auction later this year. I mean, dude you know the club will fuck with you regardless of history, they're doing it to your national captain. Why not just think of yourself for a bit? Tell them you're not interested in retention, go into auction, make millions. 

It would be really cool to see where he ends up. Maybe RCB as the next captain? Maybe even PBKS? So many teams will be looking for a captain and would love to strengthen their bowling. I daresay Pant's captaincy has been a little lacking this year, and he will not have a problem giving it up to Bumrah to get him in the team. The possibilities are really exciting. Bumrah at MI has gotten so stale and let's face it, he should've been captain this year. 100%.",9

Any MI player at this point should consider trade or going into auction. I wrote a post about this.

There's no one quite reliable like with teams like RR and KKR (who recover even after they have 5 down) and that sorta sucks, the amount of collapses in the last 5 games hasn't been pretty, it's sad how inconsistent the batting is and it also feels like everyone depends on the other to perform and show no initiative to asses the situation and play accordingly to dig the team out of the hole (esp disappointing when Klassen does this).   
  
Something feels off and I think that's going to be the difference when it comes to why we're probably not winning this season compared to the top 2.

2024-05-06 09:02:28 PM IST,SRH when the pitch isn't a national highway,8
2024-05-06 09:02:30 PM IST,"Man, 4 games now and our batting has just been off (we barely survived against RR). It kinda feels like they're all too nervy and don't have that confidence, and they all only perform if the others have performed. Our batting is just the so unreliable, and it sucks that Klassen never seems to deliver when we actually need it either. F  
  
For a team that's supposed to be known for its batting, I get insanely nervous after we're about two down, exactly because of what's happening now, and that's not a good feeling esp when you compare it with the batting depth teams like RR and KKR. The collapses in the last 4-5 games have been very concerning, it never feels even remotely safe after 3 wickets fall. We need actual match-winners. I'm also not very confident with Abhi and Head as a pair anymore, feels like those 2 bad games killed the mojo and firepower of that pair.",4

Idk, it sorta makes so much more sense to do this if we want to steer back the game after a collapse rather than saving him for number 9 when he has no proper support.",3
