2024-04-26 07:11:37 PM IST,"I think resting starc is good, but dropping him entirely wouldn't be.

He's still one of the best fast bowlers of the generation, having a rough patch. He'll turn up when it matters, but that'll be hard to do if he's not getting game time before the knock outs.

He can still contribute with the bat, and they've been winning anyway. 

Hasn't even been bowling as bad as people say anyway. Some of the balls they've hit him for 6 on have not deserved it. Such is the nature of bowling the final over of t20s.",3

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

1) Push out boundaries almost to the edge of the actual ground, give a meter or two for media/cameramen. Fuck the sponsors, we have ads, electronic boards, strategic timeouts, etc. for that shit.


Pushing out boundaries will also bring more outfielders into the game.


2) Name your impact sub before the game. All rounders will be back in contention. Better, get rid of it completely. 


3) Remove the toss. Let the away team choose to bat or bowl. Controversial, I agree. But home team will have an excuse to 'doctor' pitches which will suit their team.


4) Bonus points if a team reaches a target within specified number of overs or a team wins by certain amount of runs. You want an exciting game/tournament where even now dead rubbers could be an important game.",4

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Rinku literally said it himself at a press conference that he has niggle (side strain, as far as I remember) to explain why he is not fielding and getting sub-ed out.  
I am sure the team won't take any risks about the injury to a World Cup prospect and be the reason he is ruled out. The ones who are on the Indian team's radar have their injury situation monitored by the NCA.  
  
So, Rinku comes out to bat on a need basis to avoid any unnecessary stress.",8

Make no mistake: Shashank Singh is the most accomplished batter in SRH's history.

""What are you talking about?"", you might ask. ""He hasn't even faced a single ball."" That's all part of the genius and generosity of the great man. Unlike heartless cricketers like Hardik Pandya, who demand to get promoted up the order to showcase their skills, he prefers to give the opposition a chance, letting them face Markram and Pooran instead. He even gifts runs by bowling to level the playing field, putting selfish players like Rohit and Kohli to shame for giving up bowling themselves.

But when these many sixes are being hit, the quickness of the outfield, fielding rules do not come into conversation and it's about the skill of six hitting.

Things are definitely skewed towards the batsman but the six hitting skill and confidence of a player now is much more than a player even 5 years back could've imagine, that part of cricket has developed irrespective of the rules just on skill.

Before there was era of six hitting specialists (AbD, Gayle, Pollard etc) to do this kind of stuff but now we're moving into a era where domestic players itself are now expected to be hitting sixes like this if they wanna make it to the main team let alone the international players.",13

But as of today, I think the possibility of him getting selected is very low. Why? Because we're a country that doesn't get excited unless it's a 20 year old delivering such performances. It's almost as if Barney Stinson is our national selector - anything over 30 is hugely frowned upon. Unless you're a big name - then your form doesn't matter. Churning out talent and having a great domestic setup isn't the problem, but utilizing that talent certainly is.",30
