2024-04-09 06:56:41 PM IST,I am very worried about Nattu. The wickets have dried up and he keeps conceding runs. He has a very predictable stock delivery which is a full (not yorker) delivery at 134 km/h. Batsmen have figured him out and have carted him around.,5

2024-04-09 08:22:26 PM IST,"**9.4** banged into the track outside off. Looks like a slower ball because this balloons past Tripathi. He tries to upper-cut it and misses. **Curran is very interested and he thinks there is bat involved. The PKS fielders get together, and they go upstairs. There is indeed a nick. A clear spike as the ball is next to the bat and Tripathi, in fact, seemed to walk as soon as PBKS reviewed it. Strange sequence of events, but what matters is that SRH are now four down!**

He puts so much pressure on non strikers and doesn't let them play their natural game, rather his slow approach forces them to go all out from ball one

His captaincy and field placement are so abysmal, it's totally upto the bowler to pull out something on their own

A good captain can save easily a good 20 runs

I'm tired man, I'm so tired, we were so good under Curran last year, we are so good when Dhawan departs early without eating any balls, fuck that, I know he's a good guy but that's no reason to not criticise him
