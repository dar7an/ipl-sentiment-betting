2024-05-20 05:22:17 AM IST,"Pat Cummins is such a pro. The delivery that got Russo out wicket was bowled with laser-guided precision. A slower full-toss with pin-pointed accuracy, just at the right height to lure into into a false shot. Superb skills.

Side note: Some of these players are getting a bomb for a salary. Take Starc for example, he got a season payout of INR 24 cr. To think that he'll just have to come out and bowl 24 delivers a game, one would expect each ball to be well thought of, expertly crafted and executed to perfection.

Some dizzying figures with Starc as an example:

If you consider Pre-playoff total.

Each team plays 14 matches. So that's 336 balls to be bowled in total, assuming he plays all the games.

Given that he got a INR 24cr payout. He gets a whopping INR 7,14,285/per delivery.

Full season total.

Add 8 more overs, so 384 balls in total.

Still, it's INR 6,25,000/ per delivery.

You've got to make EVERY DELIVERY count. No room for looseners. When you step out onto that field, you've got to be well-tuned, totally switched-on and ready to strike. And professionals have a tendency to deliver the goods. Probably the reason why they command such high valuations.",2

I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with CUM DAWG. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to CUMMO. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",10
