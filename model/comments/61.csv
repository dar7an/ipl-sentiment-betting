I respect Jaiswal and Buttler greatly, but the lack of attacking the power play no matter how apparently slow the wicket is just bad. 

T20s are evolving. Losing power play wickets is mattering less and less if they've attacked up front. Fully expect CSK to take a chunk out of this chase up front if Ravindra can connect with the ball. 

Hate to overhype the kid when it's not a DC game, but if Mcgurk was playing here and had a decent game, he might make you 40 from 20 on a slow wicket anyway, and let everyone else pace their innings outside of the power play.

You accuse a batsman of a slow innings when he's not batting well on a flat pitch. Ruturaj here is batting according to the situation to hold one end up without taking any unnecessary risk - and keeping his team in a winning position.

1. Choosing to bat first in Chennai after winning the toss

2. Slow top order batting and wasting balls

3. Playing with a 1 batter less while batting first, causes everyone to bat too conservatively 

4. Playing Nandre Burger instead of Keshav Maharaj as the impact sub on this pitch

Ashwin + Chahal + Maharaj would have been great for middle overs spin choke and wickets. Boult, Sandeep, and Avesh would have been enough for the initial powerplay and death

RR is known to taper off in the second half, and I think that's happening again. The good part for them is that they already have 16 points so they'll probably still qualify but they may or may not finish in top 2",6

This wasn‚Äôt an obs few years ago. But batsmen intentionally used to run in middle of the stumps to remove the sight of stumps from fielder if they knew they can‚Äôt reach the stumps in time. This is exactly the reason why this kind of obs was introduced. This is probably the most correct usage of the rule for which it was made!,14

2024-05-12 07:18:40 PM IST,What is the special thing today? I still haven't switched to RCB DC telecast because of that.,10

2024-05-12 07:20:04 PM IST,"This must be hard to comprehend for you guys considering the pant hate wave, but I'd any day pick a guy with a fighting spirit over someone like Sanju. Guy surrenders just like that... RR should give up the hopes of winning the title under him.

They had the best squad in the 22-24 cycle,  but always lost the must win matches. And remind me of a must win match where Sanju stepped up.",-9

2024-05-12 07:22:29 PM IST,Sanju already owns the streets of Chennai without even playing for Chennai,25
2024-05-12 07:23:53 PM IST,Indian captains are consistently losing trust with overseas pacers. Yesterday Shreyas gave only one over to Starc and today Samson got Boult in only when the match was completely lost. Do you think it is justified?,20
