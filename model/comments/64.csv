Today is gonna be spicy game. DC and LSG both owners are quite passionate and animated chaps and DC have some solid power hitters. Let‚Äôs see how KL plays his game. Would be great if he strikes at 200+",3
2024-05-14 06:34:20 PM IST,"Since there is no chance for DC, it will be best for the table if LSG can win and win easily tonight. It will be amazing if they go to play offs leaving both CSK and RCB behind (assuming RCB can beat CSK and LSG wins their next match too)",6

2024-05-14 07:26:02 PM IST,"I think a lot of non SRH fans think Warner was wronged by the management which is not the full story.

There was certainly a lot more that happened. He was rightfully blocked by SRH on Twitter because he would engage with fans in the comments and post totally unrelated shit to try and win popular support. His tiktok dances on Telugu songs started feeling very strategic and it was very visible there's something more. Warner will always be loved but we acknowledge what happened.",-11

2024-05-14 07:28:54 PM IST,"Lol fans are just too fickle. If Warner was persisted with and stayed in the team, fans would be out here justifying even if he gets 5 ducks in a row, but now that he's not here I guess open season to shit on him.

2024-05-14 11:36:18 PM IST,Where are  those who said we said can't  win without jfm üòé,1
2024-05-14 11:36:43 PM IST,"Dude Kuldeep, run rate doesn‚Äôt help you. Both CSK and RCB have NRR better than you, if either of them win they qualify and if it‚Äôs a washout CSK qualify. You are already eliminated. I am amazed how such a simple fact is so difficult to understand!",14
2024-05-14 11:38:10 PM IST,"Ignore my flair and think rationally here please!
I'm not saying it's impossible for RCB to qualify but it's not as easy as most people make out here",9
2024-05-14 11:38:38 PM IST,LSG needs to shift some of their pacer scouting budget to batsmen scouting next season. This is what MI does excellently. Nurture the best available talent in our country (batsmen) and fill the remaining holes with overseas players.,11
2024-05-14 11:39:08 PM IST,Now RCB can throw away their calculators probably. Which means winning will be more difficult,10
2024-05-14 11:39:35 PM IST,"So it's pretty much KKR, RR, SRH, RCB/CSK to the payoffs. Unless of course SRH lose horribly in their last two games and RCB wins over CSK for both RCB and CSK to qualify. Damn, no new chanmpions this season too unless we do a miracle.",13
2024-05-14 11:39:58 PM IST,Can‚Äôt wait for Saturday‚Äôs clash.,8
2024-05-14 11:42:16 PM IST,RR should skip this year and win in 2028 for their 20th year win. Would be wholesome ü•∞,15
2024-05-14 11:43:39 PM IST,"CSK vs RCB isn't a straightforward ""virtual eliminator"".  CSK has the advantage. For RCB to qualify, they need to win by a certain margin or win within certain overs. Even if CSK lose, if the margin is very less, CSK will qualify cuz they have 14 pts while RCB has 12 with one game to go. And all this is only possible if the game isn't washed out. So see y'all on 18.",13
2024-05-14 11:44:06 PM IST,I wish it doesn‚Äôt rain on CSK/RCB match. Otherwise those guy would be saying they would have won the match and tournament if not for the rain even 10 years down the line. Even if there is chance of CSK loosing I would take that instead of  the other delusional torture,27
2024-05-14 11:44:25 PM IST,Rajasthan Royals : Well... Um... Thank you for that,13

2024-05-14 11:51:16 PM IST,Did someone calculate the equation for csk vs rcb. What rcb requires to go past csk,8
2024-05-14 11:52:27 PM IST,I love you DC,18
2024-05-14 11:54:52 PM IST,At least Arshad ensured that he is getting some good money in the next auction.,30
2024-05-14 11:55:58 PM IST,"If CSK vs RCB match happens then toss would be a decisive factor
If CSK wins the toss ( 99-1) in favour of CSK , If RCB Wins the toss it would be (97.7 - 2.3) in favour of CSK .",8
2024-05-15 12:00:55 AM IST,Meanwhile RR: *Casually get a (Q) beside their name despite having not played and having lost the last three games they did play*,25
2024-05-15 12:05:10 AM IST,Imagine RCB winning this ipl,11
2024-05-15 12:06:44 AM IST,"Points table based on the league matches of this auction cycle -

6. CSK - 39

2024-05-15 12:27:08 AM IST,RCB can finish anywhere between 3 to 8.,13
2024-05-15 12:28:01 AM IST,So is RCB still in or out? Can someone detail out what do they need to win by etc?,4
2024-05-15 12:49:57 AM IST,I wish that this is not the last of Warner in IPL.,13
2024-05-15 01:08:35 AM IST,"I find this funny hence the comment. 

Here is the csk pattern this IPL. 

2 wins 2 losses, 2 wins 2 losses, 1 win 1 loss, 1 win 1 loss, 
Extending this pattern of csk to the last set of games, csk already has 1 win so if they lose to RCB they continue the pattern of 1win 1 loss. 

Hence they need to break this pattern. 

On the RCB side the pattern this IPL is. 

1 loss 1 win, 6 loss 5 win. 
They need to complete the pattern by winning against csk making it 6 loss 6 win. 

I would say out of the both teams the pattern is on RCB's side because they need to continue the pattern while csk needs to break it.",23
2024-05-15 01:39:54 AM IST,Which lowest team in the table can still qualify mathematically if every possible scenario goes their way? And what scenario would that be?,6
2024-05-16 09:26:10 AM IST,So this confirms RR's qualification,2
