1. Win both games (one decent margin win, esp against CSK helps)

On 18 May : 
RCB need to beat CSK by 15 runs or more to qualify

RCB have scored 194 runs and CSK lose quick wickets and are on the verge of losing. 

Last over of the match CSK need 30 to win with Shardul at strike and MSD at the non-strikers end. 
Shardul misses the first 2 balls. The third ball is a slower one by Ferguson, Shardul misses but DK fumbles the ball which results in THALA at the strikers end.

3. RCB needs to win by over 40 runs to maintain an NRR of +0.350. 

4. RCB must also defeat CSK by a margin of 40 runs in their next game. 

5. The smaller RCB's victory margin today, the larger it must be against CSK.

6. If DC wins both matches and CSK loses to RCB, DC will qualify.

7. SRH needs to win at least one of their remaining matches to qualify.

Real cricket fans don't give excuses, they leave their jobs, they even leave their partner and kids and old parents to watch their team play a sport with stick in hand hitting a leather ball and rubbing saliva all over it.

That is real cricket fan, they will go to temple of Karn Sharma and the desolated cursed islands of Anuj Rawat, they would go to ""Human slave of sheep"" land Chepauk and he would go to Mongolia but he won't miss a match

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of girls while my thoughts drift back to azam khan. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry.

Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.

Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",-7

2024-05-12 10:15:10 PM IST,"Long ago, during the Vedic times, Kauravas was playing it's first unofficial test match against the Pandavas. The match was going in Kaurava's favour but everything changed when a Challenger from Bangalore came into bowling for the Kauravas.The Challenger from Bangalore started choking.

Panadavas was surprised and happy, it helped them so much that they vowed to add the Challenger from Bangalore into their Royal family, so they gave him their own very special and unique name - ROYAL CHALLENGER. Now, after 5000 years of that legendary match, Royal Challengers are regarded as the a GODS of choking by Hindus throughout the world.

As a religious man, I would like to end my legendary tale on the The Challenger of Bangalore and thank all cricket fans for this beautiful opportunity, Long Live The Royal Challenger.",1
