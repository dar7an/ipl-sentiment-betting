Rohit won FIVE IPLs and people said it doesn't count because MI are the best team. They just became even better, and yet look at the results. Rohit won ten games in a row in the WC. Rohit outsmarted a marauding Bazball team and destroyed them after a whole bunch of English media hype. Give the man his due recognition ffs. He's not good enough as a batter for the upcoming WC, but let's be grateful for what we have and not expect Thala every single time.

Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin b0ner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary.

2024-03-27 11:37:15 PM IST,"Looking back, saving Bumrah for later was the plan, but they have to be more flexible when unprecedented hammering is going on. Just sticking to the plan to seem cool on the surface was a bad idea. Sure, all SRH batters fired and maybe getting Head / Abhishek earlier could have reduced the target by 30? SRH changed things up reacting to MI's response. I feel like that was the difference of approach that made a difference.",14

They bowled slow balls almost exclusively at the back end. Tim and Hardik didn't adapt and wait for the ball and play their shots, they obviously have the power to clear the boundary, and instead just tried to play for faster bowling. Tim didn't even move to the off side when they were bowling on the off side, away from his preferred arc.",4
