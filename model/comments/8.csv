Rohit won FIVE IPLs and people said it doesn't count because MI are the best team. They just became even better, and yet look at the results. Rohit won ten games in a row in the WC. Rohit outsmarted a marauding Bazball team and destroyed them after a whole bunch of English media hype. Give the man his due recognition ffs. He's not good enough as a batter for the upcoming WC, but let's be grateful for what we have and not expect Thala every single time.

2024-03-27 09:25:30 PM IST,That disastrous 2022 mega-auction has hurt us so much the impact still remains. The bowling attack has never collectively been good enough since then. We've been a bit unlucky with injuries to our overseas left-arm quicks but the spin department is still so subpar when you compare it to the other teams in the IPL. Piyush Chawla should be enjoying his retirement and we've brought him back for yet another graveyard shift.,3

2024-03-27 09:33:21 PM IST,"For those who don’t seem to understand the position of Pandya right now, he is choosing to laugh because his only other option is to break down in tears and frankly I think that laughing and at least trying to keep your spirits up means that they still a slim chance but as soon as you start crying it’s over.

Also , hardik just spearheaded MI in the worst ever bowling performance in the IPL.",3
2024-03-27 09:34:16 PM IST,"An absolute massacre of epic proportions at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. We have just witnessed the collective effort of four batters who have so effortlessly dismantled the record for the greatest IPL score without having anyone amongst their ranks score more than 80. This, ladies and gentlemen, will go down in history as THAT match: the one where Pandya's team crumbled under pressure almost conceding at 15rpo. This will go down in history as the match in which only Bumrah with a 'respectable' 9 rpo had an economy under 10. It will go down as a game which few would forget. Remember, Coetzee and Bumrah prevented what could've been the IPL's first three hundred plus total — and Hyderabad have just achieved a cheat code of sorts in terms of NRR. So bring on Cummins' boys — as their carnage echoes in the streets of Hyderabad. This will probably be the end of the short-lived era of Mumbai where a Hardik Pandya had armband privileges — and a revision lesson in team building for the once masterful team builders in Mumbai Indians.",4

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin b0ner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",8

2024-03-27 11:37:07 PM IST,Can we all collectively agree this is a shit pitch and no more games to be played on these kinda pitches??? There's high scoring games and there's whatever this was. Bizarre.,23
2024-03-27 11:37:15 PM IST,"Looking back, saving Bumrah for later was the plan, but they have to be more flexible when unprecedented hammering is going on. Just sticking to the plan to seem cool on the surface was a bad idea. Sure, all SRH batters fired and maybe getting Head / Abhishek earlier could have reduced the target by 30? SRH changed things up reacting to MI's response. I feel like that was the difference of approach that made a difference.",14
2024-03-27 11:37:35 PM IST,Hope MI return to winning ways. Need more teams taking turns winning to make it an exciting ipl.,12

Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and GOAT of T20 Klassen no words for these guys. They were absolutely phenomenal. 277 in T20? Wonder was I watching Cricket 07 on easy mode? 

Crazy just crazy! I am starting to like SRH now, they do have potential to win the trophy.",29

2024-03-28 12:49:55 AM IST,Cummins is the true Man of the Match. Every batsman except for Mayank and Hardik had a great time. However it was only Bumrah and Cummins that managed to end up with bowling figures that are normal. Cummins ended up being better than Bumrah as well.,32

2024-03-28 12:49:30 PM IST,"In my opinion the match was lost due to Tim David and Hardik Pandya. They were not able to put away the slow balls by Pat Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. They bowled slow balls almost exclusively at the back end. Tim and Hardik didn't adapt and wait for the ball and play their shots, they obviously have the power to clear the boundary, and instead just tried to play for faster bowling. Tim didn't even move to the off side when they were bowling on the off side, away from his preferred arc.",4

2024-03-28 01:18:19 PM IST,"Hardik need to keep it simple,the guy trying for spotlight ,opening the ball, every batter clearing his balls over the circle with ease,mi spin department not bowling even 3 overs,mulani neither economical nor wicket taker ,tim david dropping catches atleast make him play as impact player , Still we are yet to see How mi performs when they bat 1st.Romario /nabi should take 4th overseas spot nabi bowling form took a dip but his batting still strong, romario handy allrounder who can pick 2wkts with 9 -10 run rate and can score 30runs &
