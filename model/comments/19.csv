There's a good crop of players who can genuinely play T20, don't have the baggage of knockout losses (yet) and aren't intimidated.

In comparison, Kohli lunges forward and goes with his hands and looks to manipulate the balls into gaps. If he gets a really bad ball he will try and hit it for a boundary.

No amount of nudging and nurdling and running hard can make up for the very basic fact that 4s and 6s are worth more than 1s or 2s. Simple as that.",5

2024-04-06 08:55:38 PM IST,Lmao. RCB will 100% lose this match and it will be because Koach isn't the modern T20 batsman. 200 is the new normal now and his approach and skills would more often than not make sure the team never reaches that score. If the batsman cannot hit at 200+ strike rate after playing 30 balls then they should get out trying rather than extending the misery.,3

From my scientific research, I have established that there are in fact 3 different Buttlers:

Jos Buttler - One of the world's most destructive white ball batsmen, can win games singlehandedly, but only when his team loses the toss. 

Toss Buttler - This guy rocks up whenever Buttler's team wins the toss and isn't nearly as good as Jos. Legit, the disparity between his stats when winning and losing the toss is pretty significant, especially in ODIs.

Yos Buttler - Very rare, only ever sighted in the Netherlands. Still yet to be dismissed, and strikes at 185.",7

I also think that is precisely how a t20 opener should bat. 113* in 72 balls, just under 10 an over (9.4ish to be exact) against the best bowling unit in the league. He set a platform for others to get 30(10), 24(7), 12(4) etc - but no one did. 

Anyway, now I have finished dickriding, if RCB lose (as I write this now RR are 54-1 from 6 overs) all of the criticism, blame and scrutiny will go on Kohli. Probably using his strike rate as their reasoning - but in reality it‚Äôs an excuse. If RCB lose and you find yourself slandering Kohli, you don‚Äôt understand cricket at all.",6

Same thing here. Kohli‚Äôs approach should be to hit and get going, not to protect the team from crashing. Rohit does that with MI - he goes if he can‚Äôt score, thus giving the middle order time to get their confidence and back their skills.

2) Green should bat at No. 3 and Maxwell should come in at No. 6

3) They need a somewhat consistent middle order batsman and it sucks that they haven't groomed any domestic player to do that job all these years

Suddenly in the knockouts these main players choke and then you expect bottom players to perform who did not play through out the tournament , this has been happening with india from many years.  
This is exactly what happened in wc when we were clearly winning matches still the top order batsmen went played the whole 50 overs and statpaded againts minnows also , not enough balls given to surya kumar yadav. But all of a sudden you expect him to play a match winning knock in the final.  
Same case with rcb , you do not give enough balls to lower order batsmen to play and expect them to perform and win matches when you choke that is never going to happen.  
Somewhere indian and rcb fans needs to come out of the mindset that personal milestones are bullshit only then we can win the trophies.",22

2024-04-07 12:44:34 AM IST,Fun fact whenever Jos scores 100 in IPL there's always Hetmyer at the other end,25
2024-04-07 01:22:52 AM IST,"Faf, Maxwell and Green all 3 attacking T20 batters are looking completely out of form. This has become a blessing for ODI Kohli to play at his slow SR. 

Patidar, Rawat and other Indian middle order batters are beyond pathetic. 

DK is treated as only last 2 overs batter irrespective of the situation.

Dagar, Siraj and Dayal are bowling so bad words can't describe.

Management is clueless on team selection.

Only expectation now is somehow not to finish last on the table.",6
2024-04-07 01:58:41 AM IST,"At this point we can clearly say that RCB management is clueless. Playing lomror instead of mayank Dagar could have added much more value to the team, as lomror can bowl an over or two which Mayank is doing currently (he is not finishing 4 over quota). Also, they can bring in vyshak Vijaykumar in place of Saurav Chauhan, he is a pretty handy batter down the order. I don‚Äôt understand why they are not looking at vyshak even after a good performance against KKR. Anyhow rcb does not have a game changing spinner, Maxwell and lomror can bowl 8 overs if pitch is helping spinners. They can also bring in Karn Sharma in place of vyshak if it‚Äôs really helping spinners.",8
2024-04-07 04:06:13 AM IST,RCB dropped Lomror from the team because a player that might accidentally win that match for them shouldn't be playing.,8
2024-04-07 04:16:08 AM IST," Nah for real, Kohli slows down when he reaches 40s, and 80s for milestone. Sometimes it doesn't affect that much, but sometimes it hurts the team a lot. Getting out while trying to accelerate is fine, you can't just be accelerating after milestone. 
Like it or not kohli is a selfish player. Period",15
2024-04-07 04:19:29 AM IST,"RCB should let go of everybody

Take the same approach that PBKS did

You retain your anchor in Kohli

Surround him with tonkers, every other player should have the capability to go from ball 1

For that, you'll need some excellent scouting which they aren't capable of",6
2024-04-07 05:13:48 AM IST,"Nah, today I disagree with you lot. I am seeing a lot of focus on batting but let‚Äôs be honest, isn‚Äôt this bowling attack capable of even conceding 230+ in an innings? I think they are, sadly.

180+ scores must not be easy to chase, RR has a walk in the park today.",4
2024-04-07 05:29:45 AM IST,Sanju instead of Kohli for World T20,10
2024-04-07 09:30:59 AM IST,"Terrible with bat from RCB and their bowling sucks. RR on the other hand have great bowling and multiple batters who can win a match. Today Jaiswal failed but Jos/Samson made it a canter and fantastic innings from Jos. Shows how to score a quick 100 in these conditions. 

  
RCB need some big changes. Faf did start ok, but Faf/Kohli combo is bit dubious to me.",7
2024-04-07 10:22:34 AM IST,"Forget about Kohli, wtf is this team selection? Dropping Lomror and Vyshak after they were the only good things about your team? Really?",9
2024-04-07 10:24:46 AM IST,RCB dropping Lomror is like PBKS dropping Shashank from next game onwards,8
2024-04-07 02:48:56 PM IST,It's legitimately over,2
