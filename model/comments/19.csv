But when you have a large pool, purely on a professional basis, it doesn't make sense to keep playing the same squad when you already have a fair sample size for assessment, even under the guise of 'experience' which clearly hasn't worked for years. 

There's a good crop of players who can genuinely play T20, don't have the baggage of knockout losses (yet) and aren't intimidated. 

I know it won't happen because broadcasters and hero worshippers won't allow it, but this is a fact. 

Selectors have to braver and avoid being safe for once. The last time we did that, we actually won a T20 World Cup.",10

In comparison, Kohli lunges forward and goes with his hands and looks to manipulate the balls into gaps. If he gets a really bad ball he will try and hit it for a boundary.

No amount of nudging and nurdling and running hard can make up for the very basic fact that 4s and 6s are worth more than 1s or 2s. Simple as that.",5

2024-04-06 08:32:54 PM IST,One of the main reason koach can't accelerate against spin is due to lack of raw strength. He heavily relies on timing and coordination. He doesnt have much strength to kick off slower balls and spinners. Faf or Maxwell should try to fix this.,2

2024-04-06 08:55:33 PM IST,cricinfo having a normal one. Had Kohli out instead of Chauhan.,1
2024-04-06 08:55:35 PM IST,My man lomror was absolutely smacking it and yet he isn't in the playing XI,5
2024-04-06 08:55:35 PM IST,Wait why isn't DK coming out?,3
2024-04-06 08:55:36 PM IST,Yuzi is basically the Joe Root of bowling. Not a flashy player but you look up and now he's got the purple cap,4
2024-04-06 08:55:37 PM IST,Damn a worse player of spin walks in at 5 to face a spinner at the death,6
2024-04-06 08:55:38 PM IST,RCB really is a masochist. Not letting green open or play 3. Playing Chauhan and Patidar over Lomror who saved their ass last match.,5
2024-04-06 08:55:38 PM IST,WHERE IS DK WHAT IS MANAGEMENT DOING,1
2024-04-06 08:55:38 PM IST,Lmao. RCB will 100% lose this match and it will be because Koach isn't the modern T20 batsman. 200 is the new normal now and his approach and skills would more often than not make sure the team never reaches that score. If the batsman cannot hit at 200+ strike rate after playing 30 balls then they should get out trying rather than extending the misery.,3
2024-04-06 08:55:39 PM IST,patidar written on scorecard got me for a sec,2

Avesh should not be dishearten by it, he bowled well, it just shows T20 is a cruel game and numbers do not show the half truth.

2024-04-06 09:24:11 PM IST,"Definitely a case that most of RCB is out of form, arguably the only other batters who are in form didn’t even bat (DK & Lomror) making for a brain dead decision by the management. 

Rest of the team that did bat had less than 6 balls to face (excluding an out of form Faf), with a specific role to go from ball 1 due to the match situation. Wonder what it would look like if they had 10+ balls to face? 🤔",7

2024-04-06 09:24:23 PM IST,60 from 48 for the rest of the team combined can hardly be blamed on Kohli,6
2024-04-06 09:24:29 PM IST,"I do feel like there is some validity in the argument that Kohli’s play style forces other batsmen to take more risks but on the contrary, i don’t think there is a single rcb batsman who got out trying to aggressive to cover for Kohli. They were all just kinda shit. Also what tf is wrong with this management, not sending out Dk or even lomror or ravat in the depth when they are clearly the team’s best finishers in the depth. There is no rule in cricket that states you have to have a fixed batting order",11

2024-04-06 09:24:47 PM IST,"It's not the SR or the balls faced. 113(72) is not bad when other batters shit the bed. 

It's the approach. The mindset. Should have gone for the big shots in the 18th and 19th overs when he was in the 90s with only 3 down. We had DK, Lomror. Could have made 10-20 runs difference",14

From my scientific research, I have established that there are in fact 3 different Buttlers:

Jos Buttler - One of the world's most destructive white ball batsmen, can win games singlehandedly, but only when his team loses the toss. 

Toss Buttler - This guy rocks up whenever Buttler's team wins the toss and isn't nearly as good as Jos. Legit, the disparity between his stats when winning and losing the toss is pretty significant, especially in ODIs.

Yos Buttler - Very rare, only ever sighted in the Netherlands. Still yet to be dismissed, and strikes at 185.",7

2024-04-06 09:55:07 PM IST,"Kohli’s innings today was outstanding. One of his best in my opinion. I also think that is precisely how a t20 opener should bat. 113* in 72 balls, just under 10 an over (9.4ish to be exact) against the best bowling unit in the league. He set a platform for others to get 30(10), 24(7), 12(4) etc - but no one did. 

Anyway, now I have finished dickriding, if RCB lose (as I write this now RR are 54-1 from 6 overs) all of the criticism, blame and scrutiny will go on Kohli. Probably using his strike rate as their reasoning - but in reality it’s an excuse. If RCB lose and you find yourself slandering Kohli, you don’t understand cricket at all.",6

2024-04-06 09:55:51 PM IST,Even a single over like this from Kohli would have shut up a lot of criticism that he gets. I understand not wanting to take risks for the first 15-16 overs when you're playing as anchor but if you're taking deliberate singles even in the 18th over when you're already well settled just so you can reach a milestone then it's bound to come with some criticism.,12

You can't play Test/ODI innings in a T20. RCB only were down 3 by the end of their innings.. 

Virat is slow death. He will bring down the run rate. His partner will focus on run a ball too.. 

Virat will never get out which means.. it will be too late for others.. and they will get out.

You need to have the guts to go all out in the beginning of the innings.. like Abhishek Sharma.. 37 in 12 balls. that is 10 times betters than 100 in 90 balls.",21

Same thing here. Kohli’s approach should be to hit and get going, not to protect the team from crashing. Rohit does that with MI - he goes if he can’t score, thus giving the middle order time to get their confidence and back their skills.

2024-04-06 11:03:05 PM IST,"The problem with RCB batting isn't Kohli .  It's the lack of balance in their lineup

1) Kohli and Faf are too similar in terms of batting style, and it doesn't make sense to play them together.  They need an opener who can attack from the very first ball and make use of the powerplay like Chris Gayle used to do

2) Green should bat at No. 3 and Maxwell should come in at No. 6

3) They need a somewhat consistent middle order batsman and it sucks that they haven't groomed any domestic player to do that job all these years

4) They should buy players who fit in the squad instead of going for big names, but ig RCB is more focused on brand value than performance and I don't blame them for that tbh",7

2024-04-06 11:32:25 PM IST,"You really feel for Kohli every time he ends up at the awards area despite being in the losing team. You can see that he's gutted each time. So, I don't think he plays just for milestones– he genuinely cares about the team.

The question is whether he trusts the other players in the teams he plays in enough. A byproduct of this distrust can be a lack of backing for players and a tendency to try and take the mantle of run scoring all upon yourself. Dube reportedly felt constricted when he was at RCB, and now look at him. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, but you've got to back your players first and believe in them even when they are as yet unproven.",15

2024-04-06 11:37:19 PM IST,Wow RCB played 5 games already and KKR just 3. What’s with this scheduling ?,8
2024-04-06 11:37:47 PM IST,"Kohli's case is similar to a situation in football where a striker has lot of goals on paper, but the team isn't successful as the whole system is just focused on enabling that one player.",19
2024-04-06 11:38:21 PM IST,One thing I don't understand is why do they say experienced batsmen should hold one end up so that others can bat freely? Isn't hitting faster more difficult? And shouldn't the more experienced batters take the more difficult job so that others can take a bit more time to settle?,19

2024-04-06 11:42:05 PM IST,"Ignoring this match, I don't know how the ""anchor"" came to be and the word is thrown around like candy. The only time it realistically makes sense is someone like Shai Hope in WI T20 team, other batsmen go ballistic from ball one while he doesn't let the ship sink. I really don't know why you need an ""anchor"" opening the innings when that's supposed to be the most productive period for a batting team cuz of powerplay.",21
2024-04-06 11:42:10 PM IST,[removed],4
2024-04-06 11:43:15 PM IST,Three batters hitting 30(15) is better and easier than a single batter trying to score 90(45). Expecting others to compensate in less balls is very difficult. Either you have to trust others or push the strike rate yourself if you take more balls to settle like Buttler.,19
2024-04-06 11:44:57 PM IST,Kohli/Faf should come 1 down. Let someone else utilise the pp better. That’s the only way to win. Just look at every other team bashing the shit out in pp,14

2024-04-07 12:00:09 AM IST,Tbh higher ups of RCB management doesn't care if they win or not they know they are getting their revenue from marketing Koach and RCB brand and making money so they are happy if they were really worried I would have seen better bowling picks in auction they didn't care that time,20
2024-04-07 12:01:29 AM IST,"The problem is a young player looks at Kohli, and sees how successful and rich he's become by playing for himself rather than the team, and he idolizes it, and then the mentality of this nonsense brand of cricket continues. KL Rahul is the prime example of that. He's an expert at playing these knocks. 

The cycle goes on and on, and we keep playing for personal glory, never winning anything. 

Although watching players like Abhishek Sharma gives me glimer of hope for the future. But ICT selectors will select the batsman with 135 SR and average of 40 ahead of 160 SR batsman with a low average.",34
2024-04-07 12:06:58 AM IST,"The match was decided after seeing koach playing for the first 5 overs , agree with me or not but this is the truth rcb needs to accept.",15
2024-04-07 12:07:38 AM IST,"Kohli supporters are right when they claim RCB would have been bundled under 160 today if not for Kohli. But Kohli himself is indirectly responsible for that as all the young Indian batters are sent after 3 down with a pressure to score from ball 1 which is unfair to them. The best thing for RCB would be send a young Indian to open and have Kohli at 4 as an anchor like Shreyas, Markram or Tilak. Kohli might not get Orange cap but the team would be all the more better with this.",30
2024-04-07 12:11:54 AM IST,"Most surprising thing this year is Faf's captaincy. We all know the management and scouts are bad (lol Himanshu Sharma being the handpicked by scouts and the trades of overpriced Green and Shahbaz-Dagar swap) But Faf's captaincy has been horrible so far, worse than even Dhawan.",12
2024-04-07 12:12:17 AM IST,"RR winning continuously is making it harder for DC to finish 1st this time.

But we must believe in star players Ricky Bhui and Sumit Kumar to pull it off.",20
2024-04-07 12:14:57 AM IST,Not playing Lomror in starting 11 is the worst decision you could have made RCB.,13
2024-04-07 12:15:43 AM IST,"The major problem with india is also this , the main 2 - 3 players keep on playing for the whole tournament. The batsmen in the lower order do not get much exposer.   
Suddenly in the knockouts these main players choke and then you expect bottom players to perform who did not play through out the tournament , this has been happening with india from many years.  
This is exactly what happened in wc when we were clearly winning matches still the top order batsmen went played the whole 50 overs and statpaded againts minnows also , not enough balls given to surya kumar yadav. But all of a sudden you expect him to play a match winning knock in the final.  
Same case with rcb , you do not give enough balls to lower order batsmen to play and expect them to perform and win matches when you choke that is never going to happen.  
Somewhere indian and rcb fans needs to come out of the mindset that personal milestones are bullshit only then we can win the trophies.",22

2024-04-07 01:22:52 AM IST,"Faf, Maxwell and Green all 3 attacking T20 batters are looking completely out of form. This has become a blessing for ODI Kohli to play at his slow SR. 

Patidar, Rawat and other Indian middle order batters are beyond pathetic. 

DK is treated as only last 2 overs batter irrespective of the situation.

Dagar, Siraj and Dayal are bowling so bad words can't describe.

Management is clueless on team selection.

Only expectation now is somehow not to finish last on the table.",6
2024-04-07 01:58:41 AM IST,"At this point we can clearly say that RCB management is clueless. Playing lomror instead of mayank Dagar could have added much more value to the team, as lomror can bowl an over or two which Mayank is doing currently (he is not finishing 4 over quota). Also, they can bring in vyshak Vijaykumar in place of Saurav Chauhan, he is a pretty handy batter down the order. I don’t understand why they are not looking at vyshak even after a good performance against KKR. Anyhow rcb does not have a game changing spinner, Maxwell and lomror can bowl 8 overs if pitch is helping spinners. They can also bring in Karn Sharma in place of vyshak if it’s really helping spinners.",8
2024-04-07 04:06:13 AM IST,RCB dropped Lomror from the team because a player that might accidentally win that match for them shouldn't be playing.,8
2024-04-07 04:16:08 AM IST," Nah for real, Kohli slows down when he reaches 40s, and 80s for milestone. Sometimes it doesn't affect that much, but sometimes it hurts the team a lot. Getting out while trying to accelerate is fine, you can't just be accelerating after milestone. 
Like it or not kohli is a selfish player. Period",15
2024-04-07 04:19:29 AM IST,"RCB should let go of everybody

Take the same approach that PBKS did

You retain your anchor in Kohli

Surround him with tonkers, every other player should have the capability to go from ball 1

For that, you'll need some excellent scouting which they aren't capable of",6
2024-04-07 05:13:48 AM IST,"Nah, today I disagree with you lot. I am seeing a lot of focus on batting but let’s be honest, isn’t this bowling attack capable of even conceding 230+ in an innings? I think they are, sadly.

180+ scores must not be easy to chase, RR has a walk in the park today.",4
2024-04-07 05:29:45 AM IST,Sanju instead of Kohli for World T20,10
2024-04-07 09:30:59 AM IST,"Terrible with bat from RCB and their bowling sucks. RR on the other hand have great bowling and multiple batters who can win a match. Today Jaiswal failed but Jos/Samson made it a canter and fantastic innings from Jos. Shows how to score a quick 100 in these conditions. 

  
RCB need some big changes. Faf did start ok, but Faf/Kohli combo is bit dubious to me.",7
2024-04-07 10:22:34 AM IST,"Forget about Kohli, wtf is this team selection? Dropping Lomror and Vyshak after they were the only good things about your team? Really?",9
2024-04-07 10:24:46 AM IST,RCB dropping Lomror is like PBKS dropping Shashank from next game onwards,8
