2024-04-04 06:45:17 PM IST,So no one has scored a century yet this season?,3
2024-04-04 06:45:43 PM IST,Odean Smith gone missing after Tewatia's 2 sixes,29
2024-04-04 06:53:33 PM IST,Silence in this thread very indicative of the level of anticipation (or lack thereof) for this match,6
2024-04-04 06:57:04 PM IST,Welcome to annual Tewatia match saving knock match,69
2024-04-04 06:59:32 PM IST,It's going to be a boring match script again guys. Honestly we need a bit of the drama cup in this ipl.,5
2024-04-04 07:01:58 PM IST,So we can't see Tewatia clutching it now,2
2024-04-04 07:02:25 PM IST,"Take my upvote and rise up,Finally a no match day in ipl,punjabi titans hope they win",1
2024-04-04 07:02:59 PM IST,Sikandar to conquer Ahmedabad today.,3

2024-04-04 07:03:34 PM IST,Williamson in ⛽,5
2024-04-04 07:03:36 PM IST,"Oh no

Kanos is playing 

Everybody gets to form against us

Miller missing out means Tewatia bats a bit early, we are fucked",5
2024-04-04 07:03:52 PM IST,Damn. Kane mama’s back after 2 years,36
2024-04-04 07:04:33 PM IST,Kanos mama for the win,4
2024-04-04 07:04:34 PM IST,Parthiv Patel somehow seems to be a sweet guy to hang out with.,3
2024-04-04 07:04:36 PM IST,I don't even mind if Jay Shah reuses an old PBKS script where they lose needing 5 off 7 or something. Just need this one to go deep,6
2024-04-04 07:05:16 PM IST,I wish Pakistan players were allowed to play in the IPL. It feels a bit lacking in star names nowadays,2
2024-04-04 07:05:40 PM IST,"The only thing I want from Da1

Please don't bring Chahar against a set batsman after the 14th over

Brar should bowl 3 minimum overs

Harshal should bowl 3 overs between the end of PP and the beginning of death, Curran and Arsh in death",3
2024-04-04 07:06:15 PM IST,"GT is @ 5 at 4 points

PBKS is @ 7 at 2 points

Imagine if PBKS wins today, it's like destiny always reserves a place at no 6 for Punjab",3

2024-04-04 07:07:34 PM IST,"Lord tewatia vs Punjab again since Miller is missing, good luck Punjab bros",6
2024-04-04 07:08:10 PM IST,"Not a fun fact

This is Kanos second match at Narendra Modi Stadium. Last time he played he didn't got to bat or bowl and got his ACL broken",11
2024-04-04 07:08:29 PM IST,"Just read the script ,congrats gill for reaching 3 figures",4
2024-04-04 07:08:31 PM IST,"Man Punjab and GT basically have no chemistry or rivalry, what can we even joke about in this thread, it's that game where everyone goes, eh",5
2024-04-04 07:08:49 PM IST,"sad livi is injured, estatic raza finally gets a chance",7
2024-04-04 07:09:11 PM IST,Dhawan forgot that Chahar is dropped.,6
2024-04-04 07:09:12 PM IST,"Punjab is bowling first, why don’t they have Chahar in instead of Prabhsimran? They messed up?",7
2024-04-04 07:09:56 PM IST,What has chef J Shah cooked for us tonight ?,4
2024-04-04 07:10:14 PM IST,No Miller so brar has to be used to his full potential,7
2024-04-04 07:11:21 PM IST,"Why not have Mohit in the first XI, just in case GT need an extra batter! Since they have to bring in Mohit in the second innings, even if they have a batting collapse, they just got to go with it.",3
2024-04-04 07:11:44 PM IST,"A fun fact 

Out of the 22 players named in playing XI of both teams only two has won Orange Cap in IPL, Shubhman Gill and Kane Williamson both in GT",6
2024-04-04 07:12:03 PM IST,"I won't even be pissed if GT wins

I just don't want any part of the win coming from Tewatia man

That shit just triggers my PTSD and depression, it'll end up ruining my mood for the entire weekend",5
2024-04-04 07:12:09 PM IST,"Without Miller, that GT batting lineup looks like a bunch of anchors put together. But it's probably fine since they're only playing Punjab",4
2024-04-04 07:12:57 PM IST,"People are doubting GT without Miller

Bro, they are facing PBKS with Tewatia in the lineup",9
2024-04-04 07:12:57 PM IST,don't understand the point of playing Vijay Shankar when he doesn't even bowl in any match,0
2024-04-04 07:13:25 PM IST,Just saw Punjab's impact subs. Looks like their team if they were batting first. 4 bowlers in the impact sub list. ,3
2024-04-04 07:13:55 PM IST,"Still no Karthik Tyagi even in the impact subs list, what an absolute shame",7
2024-04-04 07:14:06 PM IST,[removed],1
2024-04-04 07:14:11 PM IST,Hopefully soon PBKS plays Kavrappe in place of Harshal,6
2024-04-04 07:14:48 PM IST,"they should remove the punjab side from the ipl. auraless team, nobody will miss them",3
2024-04-04 07:15:07 PM IST,"Why won't Punjab just play Nathan Ellis, Last season was such a good season for him",3
2024-04-04 07:15:34 PM IST,"That can't be Rabada.

That's definitely a robot impersonating him.",2
2024-04-04 07:15:49 PM IST,No miller :(. Hope he gets well soon. Happy for Williamson though,2
2024-04-04 07:15:57 PM IST,"Confused seeing the impact subs for PBKS. 4/5 are bowlers.

Have they shown the wrong team.",4
2024-04-04 07:16:11 PM IST,"Another stat

Kane Williamson becomes the 4th player from New Zealand to feature in IPL 2024 after Rachin, Dazz, Boult",2
2024-04-04 07:16:28 PM IST,Why is the PBKS training kit absolute fire but the actual kits are mid?,7
2024-04-04 07:16:56 PM IST,Ashutosh Sharma gonna debut today?,1
2024-04-04 07:17:20 PM IST,they got kane in,4
2024-04-04 07:17:43 PM IST,I want us to use Williamson opening or one down. He isn’t a David miller to be coming in at 5 or 6 and start smashing sixes ball one.,12
2024-04-04 07:18:05 PM IST,KANE,3
2024-04-04 07:18:50 PM IST,Remove Punjab and bring a Haryana team and watch the fan base,1
2024-04-04 07:19:07 PM IST,"Don't understand why they brought in Williamson for Miller. Wade would've been a more logical replacement- GT have far too many anchors now.

Alternatively they could've brought in Williamson for Miller and maybe dropped Sudarsan for Shahrukh Khan or Abhinav Manohar.

GT have a good set up though and are quite smart so theyll probably go okay but fuck me that batting lineup is putrid on paper.",5
2024-04-04 07:19:40 PM IST,"If Kane is playing, then Manohar should have come in place of Sai Sudarsan.....And why the fuck is 3D still in squad....",5
2024-04-04 07:20:02 PM IST,Is this the least exciting match so far this IPL,0
2024-04-04 07:21:21 PM IST,"Damn, that top five of Gujrat Titans would work well for an ODI eleven. Or even a four day match. But for a T20, their top order really seems to lack firepower. Just anchors and average T20 players all the way. I hope they prove me wrong and blast 200+.",2
2024-04-04 07:21:34 PM IST,"hello everyone,    

ready for match 17 of the IPL??????",3

2024-04-04 07:23:42 PM IST,"Livingston and miller out, what a snooze fest",3
2024-04-04 07:24:02 PM IST,Nathan Ellis was by far Punjab's best overseas bowler last season. Why is he not playing over Rabada?,5
2024-04-04 07:24:02 PM IST,It's pretty telling where Punjab stand as a franchise when their marquee player is Shikhar Dhawan. I wonder how international players feel when their name stops at Punjab Kings at the auction.,5
2024-04-04 07:24:22 PM IST,"I think PBKS have got the team right today. Don't push Jitesh up. He's better as a finisher at 6 or 7. Curran at 4, Raza at 5 and Jitesh at 6. Looks like Ashutosh will come as impact sub. Late order hitter, good move.

If they can see beyond the price tag and bring in Vidwath, they are well covered. Vidwath, Arsh & KG in PP. Curran, Arsh & KG at the death.",5

2024-04-04 07:28:24 PM IST,To any possible Punjab fans out there: why do you continue supporting a team that hasn't reached playoffs for (iirc) 8 years? Isn't it mentally exhausting?,2
2024-04-04 07:28:28 PM IST,Happy to see Williamson playing. He's an underrated player in T20s. Also will Nathan Ellis be in the Australia squad for the World Cup? His slower balls and variations will be useful in the Caribbean.,2
2024-04-04 07:28:35 PM IST,Dhawan? PBKS dont even believe in their own captin,1
2024-04-04 07:28:36 PM IST,So who's gonna be impact sub for Punjab? Thyagarajan or Ashutosh Sharma? Who's the better batter and what's their domestic records like??,3
2024-04-04 07:28:47 PM IST,Anyone else annoyed that spectators are stepping on the seats?,2
2024-04-04 07:29:14 PM IST,"At auction pbks was looking so strong. Thier squad still does but thier on ground performance has been piss poor . Hope they can turn this around in the coming games.

2024-04-04 07:29:49 PM IST,"Why has this place and a lot in the country turned on Vijay Shankar ?While the likes of dodgy Sachin with his Ferrari fiasco are treated like Gods ,I can understand twitter being a shithole but the 180 on Shankar over the lost few years inspite of him being one of the few in Indian cricket with a 3D glasses is baffling to say the least",2
2024-04-04 07:29:51 PM IST,I hope Sai keeps his position at 3.,3

Kane shan't be selected at all.


If Umesh can't ball in death, or precisely won't bowl, They have to make their bowling line up more varied and optional.


Mohit bowling 4 in last 10 isn't a good strategy.


Bring backup part time bowlers, I dunno make Tewatia or Shankar bowl. They aren't good enough as pure batters if you wanna classify them as pure batters. Take full use of their talent.


And Omarzai should be dropped? Why? Because I want Little in the team. I don't care. He is my fav player, bring him back in 11",10
