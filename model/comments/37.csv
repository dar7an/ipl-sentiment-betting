No, because then, the anchors at the top would probably cruise along nicely for the Titans to end up at 180-odd, which will then be easily chased down.

Anchors in a batting order therefore, should be few, and heavily relied upon only when the team is already in trouble, or when chasing low scores on tough pitches. This might seem 'cheap', but to win in modern T20 cricket, this is probably the best way.",1

Fuck defensive technique, strike rotation, game management, risk assessment, running between the wickets etc. A guy like Kohli is just an ordinary IPL player now because he's only being tested in one facet of the game: hitting. He's trained all his life to be a top all round player, as do most guys like Gill, Rahul etc, players who people call anchors. Soon they won't be able to compete with guys like Fraser McGurk who have optimised their technique for only one thing all their lives. That's why pitches like these are refreshing.",2

2024-04-21 11:13:00 PM IST,Preity simply got jealous of Curran looking so young all the time so she made him the captain to make sure he ages into an old man due to all the stress captaining this team is going to give him,16

2024-04-22 05:22:42 AM IST,Let us have some more matches that like that. I want that some matches are this low scoring but they go down to the last ball as well.,2
2024-04-22 05:36:36 AM IST,Seems like PBKS is trying to achieve record last over losses in IPL. It‚Äôs more likely than qualifying for playoffs!,8
