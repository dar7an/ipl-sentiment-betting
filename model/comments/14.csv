2024-04-01 06:39:35 PM IST,Challenge for RR would be when bowling first. Who to start the new ball with and how many bowlers to start with. Sandeep is better off as death over specialist. Better to not alter his role.,1

2024-04-01 07:09:44 PM IST,"Stadium updates - Hardik did an entire round of the stadium as warmup around 630pm. The boos were kept light, mainly because it wasn't yet full. Hardik responded with a thumbs up as there were surpirisingly a few cheers too

However, at 6:55, it got clear that people were saving their boos for the toss. Rohit Rohit chants started, that's how people got to know Pandya has entered the field. Boos started 10 secs before Manjarekar started speaking. That's also why he said ""behave"" when he took Hardik's name. Boos got extra loud after his name was announced 

Samson was cheered by MI fans for winning the toss. No boos when Samson spoke. Boos resumed when Hardik started speaking

Mumbai Cha Raja Rohit Sharma was chanted just twice. It was mainly Rohit Rohit and Boooo

7:35 PM - Crowd is shell shocked and absolute silence here as Rohit gets a golden duck. Next update might be on Hardik entry now

7:53 PM - Hardik entered the ground, people booed for like 3 secs, and DJ started playing ""Ghalin Lotangan"". It's a devotional song, so people didn't boo as respect. The song ended with a Ganpati Bappa Morya chant. People finally booed again when the DJ announced ""next Batsman, Hardik Pandya!"" Good trick by DJ

8:02 PM - Hardik hit two fours. People cheering now, but Trumpet guy trolling by playing the song ""Kauwa moti khayega"" (Kauwa is generally used to refer Hardik on the internet, and the song means that even the bad guy's day will eventually come)

8:20 PM - Stadium is rejoicing Hardik's performance. Some MI fans are cheering for RR's good moments, but apart from that everyone is putting team above hatred. Very few boos now, cheers clearly outnumbering

8:22 PM - Hardik is gone. No boos apart from certain people who are here just for it. Crowd is silent in general, they realise the position MI is in, if Chawla is coming in over no.10

9:18 PM - 19.4 overs down, Hardik shown on the screen and people booed, coz he was smiling in the dressing room

9:52 PM - Hardik dropped Buttler, people ""ooooohhh""ed first, and then booed him after he overreacted

10:07 PM - Hardik cheered for stopping a four, for like 5 secs, and then people realised he is Hardik, so started booing

10:09 PM - Minor Nita Ambani boo, when showed on big screen

10:26 PM - Huge cheer for Rohit as he comes to field on boundary

10:28 PM - Hardik fields well and still gets a boo. This was purely momentum driven, as last ball was just fielder by Rohit, so they were vocal anyway. The boos were followed immediately by ""Humara captain kaisa ho, Rohit Sharma jaisa ho"". This chant continued for the next 10 mins, with a 1-2 ball gap every time

10:56 - Final boos, very light, as most people have already left the stand

Special updates - as said earlier, this was tightest security at entry that I experienced at Wankhede. Moreover, while returning, street from where the team bus exits was blocked. Generally, that's the road which people use to get back to the railway station",212

Pros:
Rohit sucked for MI as a batter (not as a captain)

Hardik brings great balance to side (ignoring 24(20))

Hardik is future proof for MI as he was likely gonna be Indian Captain


Cons:
THE WAY MI HANDLED THIS SHIT

NO Clear communication with Rohit and his future plans

No respect given to 5 times trophy captain

There still isn't a statement with both Rohit and Pandya together for a transition period, suggesting a small rift with Rohit and MI management

Rohit could be a bigger guy (even though he doesn't need to be) and help out Pandya booing (he has no obligations tho)

Mumbai Indians Management for God hope there is a RTM or more retentions rule applied next mega auction, or else it's gonna leave a massive dent of their followers

If you know anyone who says that they would not be affected by 10s of thousands of people booing them and venting hatred, then you know one.


And before anyone says that it did not affect Steve Smith, he said, himself, in the documentary that it made him angry and more determined to retreat into the bubble that he goes into when he bats. So, it did affect him - but he had a strategy to deal with it.


I would also argue that Hardik is as badly placed to face this vitriol as Smith was suited. I am not saying that Smith is a sociopath but he really cares about very little other than batting.¬†


Hardik, on the other hand, seems to care very much about his image. Ha has always expended a lot of energy trying to 'look cool', whether it is in his appearance or in his posed celebrations after taking a wicket or catch.


So, maybe Hardik would have been more likely to take that difficult catch if the Mumbai fans had not been booing him.",10

I've always aspired to be a leader like him. I'm confident that Rohit bhai will continue to guide and support me, and it's important for me to seek advice from someone as experienced as him. I'm optimistic about our collective efforts to secure our 6th IPL title.""

2024-04-01 10:25:17 PM IST,"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Riyan Parag.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: y'all are jealous of him.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into cricket in the last couple years. So you don't know how this sport works.

And because you didn't know that, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: Cricket isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""Strike rate "" or ""average "" I know they know nothing about cricket.

Parag's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest dancer ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.

So when I hear somebody say that AB Devillers is better than Riyan Parag, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Parag play wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched cricket for a significant amount of time, so I know that Parag is better.

You might be jealous of Parag's six packs, or jealous of his status as the greatest finisher in RR history, or whatever. Unless you're a cricket fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or an RR fan who watched IPL since 2008, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win cricket looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Parag isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~Virat Kohli~~ The Best Player in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Riyan Parag talk to the adults. Fair?",6

But seeing the chants for him in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Mumbai , shows he has an equal fan base spread throughout India


Also, after the World Cup, his overall popularity seems to have tripled. Even the casual fans who only cared about Kohli, seem to have converted into his fans. After the WC loss even some chicks who never cared about cricket were posting stories for the ‚Äúcaptain‚Äù. Call it sympathy or whatever, general population of India is behind him more than Kohli rn.

A prime example, Hardwork and Honesty doesn‚Äôt get unnoticed. It took him years, and his Importance finally got acknowledged by the people, specially after they saw the ‚Äúselfless‚Äù game he showed during the WC.",3

1. Don't open with Kishan, he sucks. Bring him down at 3 or 4. Open with Wadhera or Naman.

3. Use Tim David and Romario Shepherd as impact subs. Play only 3 overseas players in the playing 11.
