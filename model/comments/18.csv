Kohli

Samson

Surya

Dube

Hardik

Rinku

Kuldeep/Chahal/Bishnoi

Bumrah

2024-04-05 09:19:35 PM IST,"CSK being CSK won't change shit in the next match. But as an armchair expert, I feel two anchors in the powerplay is where you lose the game. It's good that you have given license to kill to Rachin but when he does get out in the first three over, which will happen a lot, you cannot send another anchor. Specially when you have a stacked batting line-up like CSK. You gotta send another power hitter who will swing at everything. If things do need to be anchored, you have one on the crease and he can hog the strike all he wants. Two anchors is just pathetic and kills the game in the starting only. Same happened last match, and same will happen in this match.",2

batters 6-11 go BANG BANG and amass as much runs as you can in the last few overs

There are only 2 fielders outside the circle for first 6 overs, it's the golden period to score runs, the ball is hard as well just hit it in the air well enough to clear the circle and that's what teams are doing in IPL as well. That's why we are seeing 270s being scored with ease. Why be 46/0 after 6 overs when you an be 72/1 and just destroy the opposition mentally in first 6 overs itself?This is going to be the difference between scoring 180 in 20 overs vs ending up on 230 in 20 overs.

From 2013 to 2019, whenever SRH beat csk, it needed a Warner special.

He was motm every time srh best csk in those years.

This shows not only how one sided this rivalry has been, but also how dependent they were on Warner to carry them.

Even in the year 2018 when they reached finals without Warner, lost 4 in 4 to csk.

To be fair , most of SRHs wins till 2020 needed Warner to carry them.",11
