Escorts the team to a total of 150+ to give themselves a chance. 

Doesn't hit local bowlers to make sure they gain a boost in confidence given the horrific nature of the pitches this season.

Asserts his dominance by smashing the shit out of overseas bowlers and ensures his spot for the T20WC over Chahal.",39
2024-04-29 09:28:09 PM IST,"In a way a good game where Pant had an opportunity to show us that he could play decently when ball is doing something but he was exposed heavily - if he had decided to bat sensibly (and not slog mindlessly) DC might have reached closer to 180 and that seems like a decent score to defend on this pitch (so far).

On the other hand Sanju has shown nothing else but class in this year's IPL. 

If we had to take one of the two to the T20 WC, till today I was on the fence but now my vote is definitely for Sanju. Sanju may not have shown us great results in T20Is so far but he sure has shown enough potential - he can bat sensibly when things are tricky and very well knows how to change gears. Pant, on the other hand gets exposed against good bowling (game against SRH) or tricky tracks.",16
