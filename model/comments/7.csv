2024-03-26 07:58:17 PM IST,"One thing I have observed is that CSK just encourages players to focus on one thing. Allrounders like Watson ,stokes and rachin were just allowed to bat primarily instead of putting them under pressure with the bowling also. They just have enough resources at their hand that someone else covers that part",7
2024-03-26 07:58:20 PM IST,"First surprise was our management going for an overseas player as young as Rachin. Second surprise is, being able to get him for a cheap contract.",1

2024-03-26 09:19:12 PM IST,Is it just me or does Rizvi bear an uncanny resemblance to Raina,5
2024-03-26 09:19:13 PM IST,3 runs off first 4 balls with Jaddu on strike Mohit with the ball. Uhmm where did I see it before??,5

2024-03-26 09:19:27 PM IST,Don’t want to sound super pessimistic but I think CSK could have reached 220+ the way they were going. Mitchell and Rahane ate up lot of deliveries. It is still a good score though.,4

2024-03-26 09:20:58 PM IST,Jadeja with another run-out lmao.,9
2024-03-26 09:20:58 PM IST,One of the best 1/36 spells you'll see. Stats don't reflect the skill and thought process. Big fan of Mohit,10
2024-03-26 09:20:58 PM IST,What was Jadeja thinking?,5
2024-03-26 09:21:00 PM IST,Mitchell looks absolutely cooked. Poor guy from NZ experiencing Chennai heat and humidity for the first time.,13

I still feel there should have been at least a bilateral series scheduled this year before the WC

The disproportionate representation of Mumbai in Indian cricket has held us back for decades. It's good that shit is moving away from their hegemony.

Infinite cum. You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It’s been three minutes. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide.  Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.",9

The way you dive into the catch and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth grip on the bat, and that gorgeous wicketkeeping stance. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire.  
You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the pitch, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face.  
You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when CSK got suspended and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first IPL trophy once CSK was reinstated, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then alas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2016 and 2017 were hard years for us baby, but in 2018 you made history happen. You came back home and I couldn't believe it. 5 championships and 10 finals. Here's to 6 and 11 <3  
In 2020, I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, ""DEFINITELY NOT!"" Not only have you changed the game of cricket and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious THALA, MS DHONI.",36

He’s the worst player I have seen in a long time. 

Think of that Final against Bangladesh, This mf looked scared of his life, well DK played an outstanding innings and win for us.

Pathirana's is not. Although he seems to have corrected it from last season of IPL. Last season his head was falling aside way more.

I think it's largely due to the cult of Dhoni. Dhoni had so many games that he took to the last over and finished in dramatic style that everyone started looking for the next Dhoni. But it's honestly not that important a role given how T20 cricket has shaped up in the recent years and the tactics employed by specialist death over bowlers.  
  
A less unpopular opinion - the most important role in a T20 batting lining up (at least in IPL) is the anchor who can carry you through Over Nos 7 to 14 without totally killing your runrate. A batter who gets you steady runs with rotation and maybe 1 boundary or six per over. Too many teams get stuck in the quicksand in those overs when the spinners come in. Someone who can take you over that period and leaves you enough wickets in hand for the last 5-6 over onslaught, is worth his weight in gold.",6

2024-03-26 10:41:05 PM IST,"I wonder if there's potential in sending out your slogging all rounders/bowlers in the power play to take advantage of the field and lob off the runrate, getting out, and letting actual batters get set in the middle overs. It'll see off the swinging ball as well, and if someone like rashid khan got like 10 from 5 before getting out, that's a lot better than not playing at all cos the batters hit around singles and couldn't finish the game with wickets in hand.",4
