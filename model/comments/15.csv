2024-04-02 10:15:42 PM IST,"The amount of people smugly going ""line and length"" whenever Mayank Yadav bowls have no idea what raw pace does.

Yes he has shown better control than Umran has recently, much better in fact.

But to act like this is anywhere as much to do with line and length as it is do with searing pace is nonsense.

Half the balls Mayank has bowled in this game would be hit-me balls for bowlers who bowled a similar trajectory but only bowled say 140-145. Still rapid but on a T20 track if all you do is bowl back of a length at that pace you will get sent.

But not necessarily at 150+. That is what makes pace so special. It gives you so much of an advantage of what can unsettle batters.",4

2024-04-02 10:15:54 PM IST,"Missed script by Jay Shah :

Mayank Yadav doesn't make it to the IPL, but behind closed doors practices regularly against top Indian batters, and plays practice games. Then he isn't picked for the world cup squad. India picks their regular expected squad, and makes it to the final (against Australia for example).

Then a couple of pacers fake injuries, and few other bowlers who are obvious injury replacements make them unavailable due to a variety of reasons. India left with no other choice, picks up an unknown random bowler named Mayank Yadav for the match. 

He bowls against Travis head in the second over. He bowls first 3 balls at 125 kph, making Head feel he's just a medium pacer. And then he bowls the 4th ball at 155 kph...onto the stumps... completely rattling Head, and eventually over the Australian batting line up as they get caught by a surprise.

India wins the T20 world cup after 17 years.",10

Just look at careers of Lee and Akhtar. Both used to bowl around 145 to 150Kmph when debuted and kept on getting faster. This kid is already hitting 155Kmph easily.,4

Last year they didn’t have Patidar so they were a batter short in already a thin line up, this year they have Patidar but maxwell and Faf have lost form. 

Every year it’s one thing or another. Back in gayle, AB, Kohli era…they would win a lot of games but choke near the end of the tournament. 

Now it’s just Kohli, a loud and passionate fan base that is depleting, and pure vibes. 

When Virat leaves they will become like that Delhi Daredevils team that finished last like 3 years In a row",10
