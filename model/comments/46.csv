2024-04-28 06:49:53 PM IST,Let's go SRH,8
2024-04-28 06:53:24 PM IST,RCB deserve to be in the playoffs,-4
2024-04-28 06:53:53 PM IST,"Well, that ended quickly. Now time to twiddle my thumbs and wait for the next game",6
2024-04-28 06:54:01 PM IST,"Rcb have done their part. If we win here by a good margin, we go 3rd place from 6th. Rutu just has to win the toss.",2
2024-04-28 06:54:47 PM IST,"Lmao, everyone's helping CSK qualify except themselves.",10
2024-04-28 06:55:41 PM IST,Tfw you wait nearly a week to see your team only for them to play like they've never held a bat or ball before,6
2024-04-28 06:57:06 PM IST,CSK are gonna bring in a spinner and it won't be Santner smh. Manifesting Phillips and Santner playing today.,7
2024-04-28 06:58:31 PM IST,"Slightly shorter on one side but it shouldn't make much of a difference. Down the ground, the shots need to be well timed. It looks a bit dry. Some aberations here, traditionally teams that have batted first have succeeded but not this season. Spinners haven't had a significant part in this season either as has been the case previously. It looks very dry, there's a mosaic underlay and there isn't really a sheen that you have come to expect in this year's IPL. Same surface that was used in that game against GT where CSK scored over 200 runs. This pitch produces the greatest degree of turn, 2.4 degrees as compared 1,8 degrees compared to the other pitches. Still think there will be some assistance for the spinners and for those who can bowl slower delivers but there's still runs on the board. Might just want to have couple of extra overs of spin up your sleeve. There might be significant dew later in the evening"" say Anjum Chopra and Samuel Badree",3

2024-04-28 07:00:10 PM IST,"even though SRH’s strength is batting first, still feel our best chance is to chase here",5
2024-04-28 07:00:19 PM IST,Time for Rutu to lose another toss,5
2024-04-28 07:01:10 PM IST,"Whoever bowls first has a great advantage , but if CSK are bowling first , then they are most probably winning the game.   
  
SRH are too reliant on Head and Klassen - if those 2 wickets fall a little early , then the score is not going above 200 or even 180. 

SRH's bowling is pretty good though and CSK are depending a lot on Dube. Can't expect him to hit every game , wont be surprised if he goes off early today , Gaikwad and Rahane need to step up their game , especially Rahane , he has to go crazy in that first 6 overs and don't care about his wicket - If Moeen Ali is playing , he can also play a quickfire innings. Don't see CSK winning (if they bat first) AND if they don't follow a certain plan to attack

If CSK bat second , none of these will matter as I think (controversial opinion) that CSK bowlers will get quick wickets and get them to a below 180-190 score , but still CSK may take it a little deeper than required.",4

When they are bowling first they should pick 3 overseas players which would be Head, Klassen and Cummins while keeping Markram and Philips in Impact players list and instead picking a spinner while bowling first and replacing him with either Markram or Philips in while batting according to the match situation.

I mean what's the point of even keeping Philips in Impact player after picking all overseas players in playing XI. These are some school level mistakes.",8

2024-04-28 07:50:05 PM IST,What with srh bowling lineup? They have 4 bowlers and 2 almost part-timers to finsh 20 overs of bowling even with impact rule.,3
2024-04-28 07:50:08 PM IST,Sending Moeen would've been the required chaos. Just send someone to cunt in the PP,2
2024-04-28 07:50:10 PM IST,Already a boring innings,1
2024-04-28 07:50:10 PM IST,there are teams scoring 100 in the powerplay and then there’s us,5

2024-04-28 07:50:36 PM IST,Momentum gone,6
2024-04-28 07:50:40 PM IST,If we keep playing Rahane at top and Jaddu at two down then we deserve to finish dead last lmao. I know it's the CSK way to stick with the strategy but you have to be blind to not see  how this strategy is not gonna work at all. I don't even see it's merit on paper tbh.,16
2024-04-28 07:50:44 PM IST,Shottt,5
2024-04-28 07:50:45 PM IST,Not another 4 please srh stop it 😭😭😭,10

2024-04-28 07:50:50 PM IST,No but really why is Rahane so utterly useless,8
2024-04-28 07:50:52 PM IST,Come on boys this is not 2014.  160 won’t do it anymore,2
2024-04-28 07:50:54 PM IST,"Insiders were saying CSK backing Rahane over Rachin because of experience he have, well can't do much with experience against a good side",8
2024-04-28 07:50:57 PM IST,Out of all the stadiums Chennai perhaps has the most number of baddies,11
2024-04-28 07:50:57 PM IST,Bruh is rutu behind rahane opening and jaddu at4?? Absolute brain dead moves,5
2024-04-28 07:51:01 PM IST,"we are putting all the pressure on dube to get us to a decent target. Ain't gonna reach playoffs with this approach.

2024-04-28 07:51:09 PM IST,This is like 2019 where Dhoni was carrying the batting the entire season.,16
2024-04-28 07:51:11 PM IST,Why is Mitchell being backed over Rachin lol. The latter has atleast played 2 good innings,28
2024-04-28 07:51:11 PM IST,"Enough with the whistles, goddammit",6

2024-04-28 07:51:30 PM IST,SRH gonna chase whatever is on the board by the 15th over. CSK batting is just not it man. What on earth is Fleming and Dhoni doing this year. It suck’s to see,3
2024-04-28 07:51:32 PM IST,Need a wicket as soon as possible and that too of Gaikwad else blud gonna take the game away,6
2024-04-28 07:51:32 PM IST,Even dropping Rachin didn't solved CSK's opening woes,7
2024-04-28 07:51:35 PM IST,Balls Head and Abhi will take to cunt this score:...... 10,4
2024-04-28 07:51:39 PM IST,Man I don't think teams are in control of pitches. CSK's tuk tuk squad literally needs minefields to have a chance of winning. It seems BCCI is ordering the 250+ pitches to increase the viewership.,9
2024-04-28 07:51:41 PM IST,Ruturaj has unreal control. Keeps finding gaps. Reminds me of peak Gambhir.,15
2024-04-28 07:51:48 PM IST,I think Rahane is just there to make Gaikwad look better. Just like Padikkal was with Koach at RCB,6
2024-04-28 07:51:50 PM IST,"Shastri and Haydos in the same comm box, both big, blustery positive guys, its like having Godzilla and Mothra in the same comm box",9

2024-04-28 07:52:09 PM IST,Ritu keep covering for 2-3 other batter,2
2024-04-28 07:52:12 PM IST,CSK should experiment with sending Rizvi to open the innings with gaikwad to maximize the powerplay. How much worse could he be than rahane??,7

2024-04-28 07:52:16 PM IST,It's sad to say but such elegant 4s won't nearly be enough against the RunRisers. Need an animalistic innings from someone,3
2024-04-28 07:52:21 PM IST,"It's 2019 season where Ms and Tahir carried us hard to finals we didn't deserved playing that final....

This year seems analogues to that Rutu , Dube carrying hard....",8
2024-04-28 07:52:22 PM IST,Robindro Jadeja is batting at 4. CSK's batting doesn't look any impressive. It's Shivam Dubey ji's filthy hitting form and MS' surprisingly still sharp finishing is what's getting the job done.,12
2024-04-28 07:52:23 PM IST,"Play moeen and ask him to slog.

It's not as if, he gets more balls anyways, why Mitchell?

2024-04-28 07:53:06 PM IST,I would have opened with Sameer Rizvi the way Naraine does for KKR,4

2024-04-28 07:53:43 PM IST,That was a clean hit,2
2024-04-28 07:53:46 PM IST,Jadeja at 4 is guaranteed a BCCI intervention. Delhi did the same with Axar. But Axar deserves the nod over Jadeja for sure.,3

2024-04-28 07:54:13 PM IST,Mitchell and Rahane have been pathetic this season. It's time to drop them before it's too late. A team can carry non-performing players when they are winning. CSK are not.,3

2024-04-28 07:54:26 PM IST,Csk powerplay bowling has been pathetic to say least they haven't got many wickets it'll interesting to see how they'll bowl today that to against srh attacking top order,3

SRH's hyper aggressive approach to batting means they're constantly gambling with either winning dominantly or risking a total top + upper middle order collapse.

It might hold more weight in the groups but they're going to have to significantly tweak this style of play once they reach the knockouts, because I don't see them winning a title like this.

Threw their wickets for no reason when the RRR was on par, then when they needed to pick up after the 10th over they just withdrew. Nitish scored 16(15), Klassen with 21(20), Samad is 19(18) when we needed 14+ an over. Jesus. Just terrible. And yea, ofc they get going when it's too late now.",16
