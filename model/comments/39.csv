2024-04-23 07:04:31 PM IST,"I have an idea for alternative to Impact sub.

Super powers.

You can give super powers to any one of your players

1. Like Bumrah can now bowl 6 overs and 2 of them can be consecutive.

2. Any 1 tip 1 hand catch made by Faf Du Plesis will be out 

3. Virat get's to bat twice but left handed the second time.

4. Sunil Narine can chuck

5. If MSD walks out to bat in the last over the game is now 21 overs.

6. Chest high bumpers are a no ball for Shreyas Iyer.

7. SKY can only hit 120 degrees in front of the wicket

8. Crowd catches count as out for Mo Siraj

Yes, I do realize that T20Is will have better overall bowling attacks with bowlers who actually have a brain in their skulls; but we play 3 sub-par teams in the 1st round of the tournament. Dube might still not be seen as bankable against the Pakistan pacers, but there's high chance that he will take down bowling attacks of Ireland, Canada, and USA.

And apart from those sureshot Ws, it'll just be a bonus if je does go well against Pakistan & the 2nd round teams. By that time, if he has consistently fired, he will have that confidence & momentum needed to possibly tear down better attacks.

I think Dube should be in that 15.",9

Samson‚Äôs record in Internationals has been poor but he was only given chances in minor tournaments. He has shown strong temperament and match awareness for RR and has been excellent so far for the franchise

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Marcus. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. 

Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",7

2024-04-23 11:50:39 PM IST,Harsha sad cuz he won't get to interview ruturaj and talk about MSD advices.,29

2024-04-23 11:53:08 PM IST,A rank turner might be there during the next match.,5
2024-04-23 11:53:30 PM IST,Ohh SRH is going to bat on a rank turner aren‚Äôt they?,11
2024-04-23 11:53:34 PM IST,I am rooting for RR and LSG this year,16
2024-04-23 11:53:46 PM IST,"in the last six years csk won 3, MI won 2, GT won 1, Literally 5 out of 6 is between CSK and MI  and all the other irrelevant team fans who have never seen their traumatized & silenced team winning are crying in this thread on csk's one loss, Shows levels, LMAO.",-8
2024-04-23 11:53:52 PM IST,"This is a great win no doubt, but it has made one thing clear that old MI-CSK dominance over IPL is waning. It will be amazing to see RR-KKR-SRH-LSG pairs in playoffs this season for once",16
2024-04-23 11:53:53 PM IST,Why is Harsha cutting off KL?,10
2024-04-23 11:54:13 PM IST,Harsha ü§° bringing up KL's personal life for no reason,25
2024-04-23 11:54:39 PM IST,What the hell Harsha fuck u,9
2024-04-23 11:54:43 PM IST,Can we agree that LSG owns CSK this IPL?,41
2024-04-23 11:55:10 PM IST,"With every team‚Äôs batting looking so good, im getting worried more and more about India‚Äôs shocking bowling lineup",15
2024-04-23 11:55:15 PM IST,"CSK bringing out a rank turner next game, only to get fucked by Abhishek Sharma and Klaasen would be a spectacle to watch",30
2024-04-23 11:55:19 PM IST,"bowling was obviously not on par and stoinis was just abolsutely in the zone 

but fucking up the batting order was completely unnecessary. like why fix something that wasn‚Äôt broken? why would you send jaddu two down, like what even",13
2024-04-23 11:55:23 PM IST,KL brings calmness with him,16
2024-04-23 11:55:56 PM IST,"Good looking 

Big muscles

This kind of innings 

Reason Zampa is mad for him",32
2024-04-23 11:56:06 PM IST,"Will be interesting to see next year if LSG and GT are able to continue their good performances after a mega auction, that is where their team culture and mentality will show. Both have definitely done great in their first cycle.",14
2024-04-23 11:56:49 PM IST,Why is harsha so shit...,12
2024-04-23 11:57:04 PM IST,The yellow jerseys in the stadium still happy because they ~~won~~ got to see MS.,19
2024-04-23 11:57:12 PM IST,Im fine not qualifying this season as long as CSK don't qualify for playoffs as well,41
2024-04-23 11:57:44 PM IST,Great interview by Stoin,7

2024-04-23 11:57:46 PM IST,I really hope this doesn‚Äôt induce us to include him in the T20 World Cup plans. The guy completely fucks it up every time it matters.,11
2024-04-23 11:58:31 PM IST,"Stoinis is so class.

Already at such a young age he is talking about giving over to youngsters.",23
2024-04-23 11:58:37 PM IST,"I couldn't hit boundaries at one point, to pathirana basically 

How honest they are man, wish our players were this honest at giving others credit and clarifying their inabilities.",21
2024-04-23 11:58:42 PM IST,"Harsha man wtf is wrong with you.

Pushed Pooran up the order question because of how long he is being bitching about it on cric buzz and now Stoinis contract question.

Wtf man",21
2024-04-23 11:59:53 PM IST,If ruturaj is captain wht the fuck is jio cinema using dhoni picture in the cover for their video against kl rahul,29
2024-04-23 11:59:54 PM IST,"Harsha could never ask tough questions to the Indian stars.
Glad Stoinis showed humility and honesty. 
Harsha probably thought he came off funny.",32
2024-04-24 12:02:33 AM IST,Thala running his tractor over the pitch as we speak for the next game,48
2024-04-24 12:02:34 AM IST,GG might have got it wrong by buying Starc but he certainly got it spot-on by getting rid of Lockie and Shardul.,21
2024-04-24 12:03:54 AM IST,"Stoinis thinking of giving chance to youngsters 

& there is some player who still want to play IPL till 50",20

2024-04-24 12:05:14 AM IST,Still can't get that slow-mo shot out my head where one LSG fan is surrounded by yellow jerseys and they just look at him celebrate as if they're the most calm bunch of people lol.,50
2024-04-24 12:06:02 AM IST,Padikkal and Starc are the rare players that peaked in RCB and became shit after leaving them¬†,25
2024-04-24 12:10:35 AM IST,"Anyone who knows ball will know that CKS will easily clap RR and SRH. Their hardest matches will be Punjab(one win confirmed), GT and finally against RCB to qualify.",1
2024-04-24 12:12:17 AM IST,"I hope from next game on, LSG plays Arshin Kulkarni. LSG peeps, he is your Ashutosh Sharma / Abdul Samad. That quick fire 25 (10) kinda guy. Give him 2-3 games, some game time and time to settle. He will come good. Not Lolikkal",15
2024-04-24 12:13:21 AM IST,2 years ago we chased 211 against csk at brabourne. That game was even better. Today was just a replay,27
2024-04-24 12:14:10 AM IST,The reason CSK lost today was because they took Kl Rahul‚Äôs wicket too early.,13
2024-04-24 12:16:01 AM IST,"Random reminder that ""Thala For A Reason"" aka ""TFAR"" meme started on r/CricketShitpost before becoming mainstream",28

2024-04-24 12:33:51 AM IST,"I remember just these two LSG vs CSK games before, people and AI and what not were predicting an 80% playoff qualifying chance for CSK and just 15% for LSG. I mean So much difference for just 2 points difference.",21
2024-04-24 12:58:46 AM IST,"The hero worshipping culture is prevalent all over India but in south India it's on another level.






Recently one guy in Chennai spent around Rs 60,000 to meet Dhoni when his daughter's school fees wasn't paid for months.




Another guy in tamil nadu, who was a Kohli/RCB fan murdered a guy who was talking ill about Kohli/RCB.






And no it's not only limited to cricketers. They worship all kinds of celebrities down south.






I remember in 2016 when Rajnikant's movie Kabali was released, in the first show around 3-4 am in the morning people were showering his photo with milk/coconut water and were like literally worshipping him.






In 2014 when Jailalita was sentenced to prison around 10 people in Tamil Nadu commited suicide. In 2016 when she passed away, people were crying beating their chest. This time the suicide number was 70+........you can imagine....








You won't see these things happening in rest of India. South India is next level in hero worshipping.",38
2024-04-24 03:20:22 AM IST,"Now even Stoinis is in form, once Starc gets in form or is rested for the BGT and we open with Behrendoff, this squad is pretty much complete. I‚Äôd like to also see Tim David finish a couple of games",18
2024-04-24 03:31:39 AM IST,Love to see this team lose. That too in Chepauk.  Hahah good times.,48
