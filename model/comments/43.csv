So, how about some names that feel a bit more down-to-earth? Here’s what I’m thinking:-

* Delhi Duds
* Punjab Peasants
* Chennai Ordinary Serfs
* Rajasthan Ryots
* Bed Setters Hyderabad
* Hapless Commoners Bangalore
* Mumbai Tryhards
* Lucknow Plain Amateurs

We already lack good all rounder options and with impact player rule, the new players are incentivized to focus on only 1 aspect, batting or bowling.

And after seeing tonking like this, which 16-18 year old kid out there is imagining himself becoming a top tier bowler in t20. What is their incentive to focus on learning and improving bowling instead of becoming 100th T20 opening smasher batsman? Especially when they see top tier bowler like Bumrah going for 18rpo?",4

3. Impact rule








You won't see these 3 things together in international t20s. For example, SCG has flat track but they have longer boundaries to back that. Eden park in NZ has small boundaries and flat pitch but you won't see impact rule there. 




So yeah IPL ≠ T20i . Below 200 is still the norm in international t20s. People watch porn and think that this is what real sex looks like. Similarly BCCI is serving batting porn for entertainment purpose. Watch and enjoy. But don't think that this is what international cricket looks like.",7

Hey JFM My Love ,

I hope this letter doesn't catch you off guard, but I just couldn't resist letting you know how much of a crush I have on you. From your sexy hair to that killer batting stance, you've got me swooning every time you're on the field.

Seriously, those shots you play? They're like poetry in motion. And let's not even get started on your fitness – I mean, have you looked in the mirror lately? *Sigh*.

But it's not just about the cricket, you know? There's something about your confidence and charisma that drives me wild. You've got that irresistible charm that makes me want to watch every match, just hoping to catch a glimpse of you.

So yeah, consider this letter a declaration of my admiration for you, both on and off the field. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan in me – and maybe a little more than just a fan, if you catch my drift.

Looking forward to seeing you dominate the game (and maybe a few hearts) in the future.

All the best My love",5

3. Prepare a variety of pitches- Don't make dustbowls or 300 wickets , they are fine occasionally but get tiring after a point. Make PITCHES where there is a balance between bat and ball!",5

Hey JFM My Love,

I hope this doesn't come across as too forward, but I've got a major crush on you. Your hair, your stance, those shots – they all make me weak in the knees.

Seriously, watching you play cricket is like watching a seduction in action. The way you handle that bat... let's just say it's got my imagination running wild.

And don't even get me started on your fitness. You're like a Greek god out there on the field, and I can't help but imagine what else you could do with all that strength and stamina.

But it's not just about the game for me. There's something about your confidence and swagger that's downright irresistible. You've got this magnetic charm that draws me in every time I see you on TV.

So here's me, putting it all out there – I've got a thing for you, JFM. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan who's more than just a little bit obsessed.",2

Have they done something to the pitches?  The pitches are looking and playing like a B grade synthetic grass over cement pitch.

The poor bowlers must be having nightmares.  When Starc was injured in training it crossed my mind he may have been looking for a way to get out of this batting paradise and spiked his finger on purpose (Im joking of course).

These totals are spectacular but I miss the occasional low scoring game that comes down to the last couple balls.",6

It is especially true about Indian fast bowlers. We don't have fast bowlers that are good enough to enter into a national team and the larger number of teams means that the thin fast bowling talent that we have has been further diluted for each team. There are a lot of teams whose best Indian fast bowler is a guy that is significantly far away from entering into the Indian team.,1

2024-04-27 06:21:05 PM IST,"Pandya sabotaged MI on all fronts - be it toss, captaincy, batting, bowling and even fielding. He shouldn't be playing the WC ahead of dube-rinku or even Samson.",8

2024-04-27 06:21:21 PM IST,DC should easily win by 95+ runs here. Top 4 spot isn't far.,3

2024-04-27 06:24:00 PM IST,MI bowlers must be the worst of this season (apart from Bumrah Ofc). No variation in line or length when everyone is trying on slow deliveries has been the nail in their coffin.,9
2024-04-27 06:24:03 PM IST,Of course this singles and dots is how you chase 257 in a t20 match. Pandya knows best,4

2024-04-27 06:24:07 PM IST,Almost feel like even timing and touch like Surya won't be enough in T20 in the future. You will have to just have pure power. Bigger guys will dominate. Seems to be the way it's going.,6

KL Rahul - The wicket is good, there's not much dew in Lucknow and the wicket will play well for the entire 40 overs. We'll need to play some good cricket. It's nice to get past 200, every team would like to do so, but the dimensions of this ground favours the bowlers a bit more and we've enjoyed it. No changes for us. Every player goes through a bit of time like that when you can't get runs ( asked about Padikkal's form). He looks good in the nets and he'll have to stay positive, you saw last night when Jonny came back after getting dropped and then getting a hundred.

2024-04-27 07:18:59 PM IST,Hardik the captain in GT was more flexible with his batting and was actually free. In a star studded MI line if he decides to come 2 down he will eat up Tilak's spot. If he comes down 1 down then it will make Surya look weak. MI were getting comfortable with Green and have only dug their own grave. It's fun to watch nonetheless from entertainment perspective with the drama it provides.,3
