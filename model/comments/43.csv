Hey JFM My Love ,

I hope this letter doesn't catch you off guard, but I just couldn't resist letting you know how much of a crush I have on you. From your sexy hair to that killer batting stance, you've got me swooning every time you're on the field.

Seriously, those shots you play? They're like poetry in motion. And let's not even get started on your fitness ‚Äì I mean, have you looked in the mirror lately? *Sigh*.

But it's not just about the cricket, you know? There's something about your confidence and charisma that drives me wild. You've got that irresistible charm that makes me want to watch every match, just hoping to catch a glimpse of you.

So yeah, consider this letter a declaration of my admiration for you, both on and off the field. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan in me ‚Äì and maybe a little more than just a fan, if you catch my drift.

Looking forward to seeing you dominate the game (and maybe a few hearts) in the future.

All the best My love",5

Hey JFM My Love,

I hope this doesn't come across as too forward, but I've got a major crush on you. Your hair, your stance, those shots ‚Äì they all make me weak in the knees.

Seriously, watching you play cricket is like watching a seduction in action. The way you handle that bat... let's just say it's got my imagination running wild.

And don't even get me started on your fitness. You're like a Greek god out there on the field, and I can't help but imagine what else you could do with all that strength and stamina.

But it's not just about the game for me. There's something about your confidence and swagger that's downright irresistible. You've got this magnetic charm that draws me in every time I see you on TV.

So here's me, putting it all out there ‚Äì I've got a thing for you, JFM. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan who's more than just a little bit obsessed.",2

2024-04-27 06:19:19 PM IST,Another thing that is there is that the quality that the bowling attacks have has definitely downgraded compared to what it was a couple of years back. It is especially true about Indian fast bowlers. We don't have fast bowlers that are good enough to enter into a national team and the larger number of teams means that the thin fast bowling talent that we have has been further diluted for each team. There are a lot of teams whose best Indian fast bowler is a guy that is significantly far away from entering into the Indian team.,1
