2024-04-18 08:49:15 PM IST,People wondering what happened to Arshdeep - it's the same thing that happens to 99.99% of bowlers in history who are yorker merchants. It's too hard to sustainably bowl yorkers unless you are aided by something like a strange action (there's a reason Malinga/Bumrah low full tosses were still hard to hit). Miss your length by an inch and it's a slot ball getting smashed or a full toss that's easy to deposit.,8

This no ball gave me a nostalgia. I remember Bumrah bowling frequent no balls in his initial phase of his career but slowly he improved, I don't know if a lot of people noticed but he improved in a lot of areas since he started playing for us. Another example can be fielding, initially he was miserable at field but now he's decent.

We sometimes forget to appreciate our top performers, which is still ok. But I remember Bumrah was trolled when he got injured. We should treat him and protect him like we do for VK and RS.",7

2024-04-18 11:54:00 PM IST,people who hate bowlers bowling wide would probably take 2 to 3 bounces to even reach the batsman if given chance to bowl.,-7
2024-04-18 11:54:17 PM IST,"I don't get these comments like Kohli should leave RCB, Ashutosh and Shashank should leave Punjab 


Yeah every strong team should just steal good players from weak teams right? Stupid mindset that


Just because Punjab has lost more matches than they've won doesn't give any team a right to steal their players who they've unearthed",24
2024-04-18 11:55:13 PM IST,"Again the ones talking about Dube in place of Hardik.

Dube hasn't bowled a single over in last two seasons. Not even a single over. We are talking about pacer all rounder spot. Not a ""guy who can maybe fill in as part timer if rarely needed"" spot. Bowling in SMAT vs IPL is a different beast. You want him to suddenly start bowling for India in a WC?

Seriously just think about it for a second, how can you not see it?

No matter what you think of Hardik. He literally is one of his kind for India. Closest option is Shardul Thakur, that's it and he hasn't bowled well. 

Hardik has also proven more clutch many times in LOI's than Thakur, so it should be a no brainer that we need a in form Pandya for India, not a mentally abused, down on morale Pandya. It could've been fine if we had good pace line up but it's just Bumrah and no one else.

You can't deny that player wise India needs him, there's a reason why India was hoping so much for Pandya's recovery in 2023 WC until finally declaring his injury.",11

4 in the 20th over

MI : good

MI: Mid
PBKS: good

MI : horrible 
PBKS : horrible

The game was decided in the powerplay lol",9
2024-04-18 11:56:12 PM IST,Comical that we have Bumrah and Coetzee chasing for purple cap but can‚Äôt do shit in the field. I think it‚Äôs high time we look for Thusara for Nabi and exclude Madhwal for an Indian batsman.,16
2024-04-18 11:56:49 PM IST,"This is literally the perfect T20 pitch , a good bowling unit can restrict a team to 160-170 and a good batting performance with death hitting  can push to 190+ .",23

2024-04-19 12:02:37 AM IST,what the fucking tone he has got he just starts his every phrase like a movie and gives a proper climax to every phrase damn.,8
2024-04-19 12:02:40 AM IST,"Lol Murali Kartik probably thought Bumrah will say, ""Oh Wizard of Ahmedabad sounds amazing""",15
2024-04-19 12:05:35 AM IST,Risking a run out like that when you're 9 down while having 5 whole balls left to score at least 10 to tie is some next level bullshit. Absolute 0 IQ stuff. I get that these people aren't batsman but you'd think that that's basic common sense considering they're playing at such a high level. Terrible finish. Pyrrhic victory for Mumbai.,36
2024-04-19 12:07:45 AM IST,"PBKS is like RCB, only difference is that before losing it keeps giving you hope that they will win till the last moment until they lose again.

Don't know whose fan is feeling worse this year.",14
2024-04-19 12:08:15 AM IST,Nabi was not being used properly. He is not a wicket taking bowler but he is not going to leak too many runs though. He should bowl at least 2-3 overs every match. And Thushara can be played as an impact sub..(Shepherd for batting and Thushara for bowling) And playing any of them (madhwal or gopal) based on the play condition might make more sense,15
2024-04-19 12:13:40 AM IST,"I was a bit disappointed but overall happy after today‚Äôs match.

Then I saw our next fixture, and if this same lineup with same strategy is playing, us MI fans need to exchange numbers with RCB fan therapists.",17
2024-04-19 12:16:08 AM IST,"Get extra batsman in place of Madhwal and his job should be just to hit. It doesn't matter if he loses his wicket soon sometimes, he is the extra batsman. Make him like the Narine or Ashwin of MI.

Thushara in place of Nabi, Piyush in place of Gopal. Need more spin overs on an unexpected turner? David and Tilak bowl some part time spin.",-8
