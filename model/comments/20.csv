For context, I have been a Kohli fan throughout my adult life, but Rohit is just better to eyes and the way he batted in WC 23 got me a lot of respect for him.",15

His average score would be 25’ish (quite good acc to his previous performances in T20is) but thats about it. He’ll score a rocking 70+ in a match against SA or ENG and a matured 50+ in a match against PAK or SL. There’s no point keeping high hopes and then getting underwhelmed. He def looks in good form and may deliver as well, but the other 6 batsmen would have to play a T20 like a T20 and not *roam in USA’s slow gardens*. 

It’ll be really great if he exceeds our expectations and delivers more than my predicted 25 average. I’d love to be proven wrong by Rohit in this.",5

He wanted a top spot in a different team. Can’t blame any player for that. Goes on to win a trophy as captain, good batting performance, and enters the final again next year. It’s true that Nehra/Gill played a big role there, but still. Now in 2024, MI is looking to transition from Rohit because of age. Their options are: SKY, Bumrah, Kishan. None of them have a captaincy record. Or they can approach Hardik, a proven IPL captain, ex-MI player, and the likely future ICT t20 captain. Remember, Hardik also isn’t an outsider to MI. He grew up here, helped us win 4 trophies. He has pedigree with MI. As much a claim to captaincy as Boom/SKY. The only party to blame in the whole fiasco is our management. That’s literally it.",1

Every team has matches where there are a lot of empty seats. This should serve as an example to them to get a lot of people (students free of cost or general public at a very low rate ) in the stadium. I don't think seats would go empty if they were like 100 rupees for those upper stands which are a lot of times empty in huge stadiums like Gujarat. People from a certain segment of the society do not need a perfect view of the pitch but the whole experience of it all. This will have multiple advantages:

1. Develop a stadium culture in the city 
2. More sales for the vendors inside the stadium 
3. Real fans can attend the stadium at a minimum cost

It was an innings of 3 phases. Mumbai Indians won the powerplay convincingly thanks to some sublime hitting from Rohit Sharma, who showed us that it is a typical Wankhede wicket where you can trust the bounce and hit through the line. 

However, DC seemed to figure out that there was a patch on that surface where the ball was holding up a tad. They used the off-pace balls well and pulled things back in the middle over. From over number 7 to 15, only 63 runs were scored as MI's middle order seem to loose their way with 4 wickets going down. Axar Patel was the pivot for DC in this phase. 

However, then we entered the final lap and MI hit turbo mode. Last 5 overs saw 96 runs being scored. David and Shepherd demolishes the DC quicks who were all over the place. Too many wides as well as yorkers going wrong and being converted to full tosses and sixes, eventually.

It's something they do from a young age for almost 3 decades. Shouldn't they keep getting better given ""practice makes a man perfect"". Sure in team sports it also depends a lot on the opposition as theoretically even they'd be getting better with time. 

It's not a steady or steep betterment that I'm talking about. But just minor ones which have major results. Like how Bumrah is able to bowl such yorkers at that pace but not every pacer even with experience would be able to bowl like that.",5

2024-04-07 07:09:58 PM IST,Ayyo. Stubbs shouldn't have taken single to give strike to Axar. Wasted two balls. Who knows it could have come down to 25 runs in last over,4
2024-04-07 07:09:58 PM IST,MI backed the wrong South African in Brevis,3
2024-04-07 07:09:59 PM IST,Same no. Of runs needed what Shepherd scored in last over,3

2024-04-07 07:23:30 PM IST,"Shit captaincy
Unimaginative throughout. Pant looks like he has no clue when anyone plays aggresively. Nortje isn't able to bowl death, so try someone else for once? Only axar looks like a bowler good enough. If Kuldeep and Mukesh don't recover, its seems very difficult that we see another win. And if we are relying on Kuldeep and Mukesh to control run flow, its says quite a bit about our bowling unit.

Batting order could have been played around with. Come up when you're chasing 235 Captain. FFS. Porel is a young lad. Take some responsibility with the bat and come up captain, especially when you're in form. 

We're stuck with all has beens and others who are still recovering. Its so frustrating to watch at this point. 

Feel sad for Stubbs. He is stuck with them. 
Every win will need some sort of miracle. Please dilute the franchise. Its been long enough",13

Axar man, no words, please stop batting and become a full time spinner so your team can look for another all rounder.

Porel buddy, good start, wayy too slow, gotta get some slogging practice in.

Shaw keep the good form up.

Stubbs have my children.

They could have chased 60 in last two, thats how bad Shepherd and Coetze are in bowling.

I stead , we got this shitshow by mediocre players.

And Yeah, India are winning jackshit at WT20. ALL pandya, Jadeja and Axar are shiity finishers and other temas have much much better finishers than these clowns.

Perhaps India should go with five bowlers, what good Pandya's bowling going to do anyway? And what good Jadeja or Axar batting going to do?

If Our main bowler is getting hit, you damn sure as hell know, Pandya is going to get hit, no point in playing him, get a extra batsman anyway, play jadeja, Axar as bowlers and pray they can bat, because they damn can not.",14

Surya
Rinku/Shivam Dube
Jadeja
Chahal
Bumrah (VC)
Arshdeep

Round this team with Sanju(backup wk), Avesh (nailing yorkers these days), Kuldeep. 

We can take Abhishek Sharma along as a surprise as he can bowl too for direct swap with Jaiswal if injured to complete team of 16. Use him when he is on top form.

Sorry no Rohit, Rahul, Pant please.. or even Tilak, Jitesh etc.. sad for Ruturaj though, he doesn't fit in.

The whole point is that we need players who can strike atleast > 140. Some ofcourse 220 like Dube. WI and USA would have mostly dry surfaces.. hence good players of spin.",-10
