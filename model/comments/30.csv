Those first few powerplay overs are so often underutilised in my opinion. 2 out, hard ball and almost exclusively quick bowlers, there's a massive opportunity to really score a lot and it's worth burning a wicket taking that on. Travis Head isn't going to come off all the time, but he's smart enough to take on the areas where there are no deep fielders and has the skill to carry the plan out. I think more teams should explore this option of at least one batter being hyper aggressive early. They do it late when the field is back and the ball is soft, why not take the risk earlier too?",3

There's a fan whose passion never subsides.
For the team that falters, stumbles, and falls,
Yet he stands unwavering, through stadium walls.

With each match, hope flickers, then dies,
But he returns, fueled by love, not lies.
Through seasons of sorrow, he bears the pain,
For his loyalty to the team will never wane.

They're the underdogs, the butt of jokes,
But in his heart, they're the ones he invokes.
For it's not about glory, or trophies gleaming bright,
But the bond with his team, through every fight.

Through losses aplenty, and victories few,
He stands by them, through and through.
For it's not just a team; it's his passion, his creed,
In the world of ipl, it's all he'll ever need.

So here's to the fan who stays true,
To the team that breaks his heart anew.
For in the game of love, he's the champion crowned,
A supporter like him, rare and profound.",3

Like even Jinks can justify his position and thrive in CSK, certainly someone with quality of Kohli can be used to win matches. But not with RCB tho, RCB have no philosophy neither any strategy or plan. They are all headless chickens relying on individual flashes of brilliance. Absolutely brain-dead management and they totally deserve it. Kohli should have left years ago, there's nothing to prove being loyal to a marketing company and not a serious cricketing team.",-2

2024-04-15 09:46:06 PM IST,We need an absolute bowling friendly pitch where even 80 runs is a huge challenge.  This is like hitting practice and the one with more hits wins. One game like this is fine but it's already the 3rd one this ipl.,8

2024-04-15 09:46:38 PM IST,MI has been trash this year but they have 5 trophies and an actual legacy to shield them from underperforming for a season of two. Rcb management on the other hand absolutely refuses to change. It literally plays with the emotions of its fans who are absolutely okay as long as Kohli keeps scoring runs. Shittiest franchise ever.,4

Imagine U are an upcoming talented young fast bowler from any country and watching this match how would they feel? It is better to put bowling machines in future rather than actual bowlers if u want such type of horrible t20 matches.,15
2024-04-16 12:54:05 AM IST,RCB can stop playing the remaining games give away 2 points to the teams and bowlers can still come out with a mental victory not having to go through the carnage. Absolute shit of a bowling performance this season.,14

Ipl is changing alot thats for sure, interesting to see srh dominating for the first time but it will be even more intresting to watch how srh will perform in pressure when they meet csk or mi",26

2024-04-16 04:10:01 AM IST,This is too much. We need to be having some of those rank turners from Sharjah in order to balance that out.,13

Bat makers are feasting though",20
2024-04-16 06:53:36 AM IST,Might as well have batters power hitting for 20 overs with a machine on the other end.,13

2024-04-16 09:24:01 AM IST,The funniest thing about this match is that RCB's NRR improved.,17
