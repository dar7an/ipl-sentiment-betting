Indian all rounders in T20.

  
Seriously, name me one Indian in IPL that have given an all rounder performance.

Jadeja and Axar are good enough bowlers but Damn , they are worse baters than many teams' taileneders batters, its disrespect calling them all rounders.

Pandya is a trash bolwer and trash finisher, I dunno where he stands for team India selection. Why? After all selection should be based on form, and he is a shitty finisher and bolwer, and thats going to be his role in T20WC. What a joke.

Tell me one good all rounder this whole IPL for India, you can not.

India is not going to lose wc because anchors, or old guards or because lack of Intent, they gonna lose becuase we have got JADEJA, AXAR AND PAndya as our finishers, i dunno man, if i was an opner, i damn sure woukd be scared to show intent when your batting ends after 4 down

Saw it with Yuvraj; those who've seen his peak hitting ability and then him in the mid 2010's will know. He used to 'touch' sixes, and then lost his hitting form. Sachin's ability to whack it also reduced over his career. It's physically not possible to keep being that fluent. 

I think that's happening with Pandya after all his injuries and probably with KL. You want everyone to keep being peak level but it's not possible. Sad but true. Even Rinku and SKY won't be the same in a few years, so please, let's play those who are in their peak zone right now.",7

The comparison with T20 World Cups is also a logical fallacy because

1) The pitches in T20 wcs are actually much more bowling friendly, at least in the last World Cup

2) In 2016 and 2021 when the pitches were actually good the only teams that did well were crazy good at power hitting

I won't be able to score and I'll eventually go back to being off strike, angry. Sometimes we will look across the wicket and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will be out, and the other will lead him outside the infield.

6. Shahrukh Khan 
7. Tewatia 
8. Wade 
9. Rashid 
10. Noor
11. Umesh
12. Mohit

Sai and Gill are a good opening pair as they showed today

Vijay Shankar's best position is at No:3 and unless they play him there they might as well drop him

Omarzai can easily bowl 4 overs and be a pinch hitter in middle order 

The explosiveness of Abhinav, Shahrukh, Tewatia, Wade and Rashid is what they desperately need after solid platform laid by top order 

In terms of bowling, they have 5 proper options in Omarzai, Noor, Rashid, Umesh and Mohit and decent 6th bowler options in Tewatia, Vijay Shankar, and  Shahrukh Khan to try in middle overs",2
