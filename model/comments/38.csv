2024-04-22 06:27:34 PM IST,Another lord Parag 50 incoming I guess,4
2024-04-22 06:31:08 PM IST,Lord Parag Orange Cap coming,3
2024-04-22 06:33:21 PM IST,"If Mumbai wins today, it's gonna be a statement for other teams bro, we have a chance to leapfrog to Number 4 if we play very very good.

Yes, we've had issues, but we are gaining momentum. Minor tweaks in our bowling lineup should fix a lot of the issues, Nehal and Naman also don't deserve to sit out but its the nature of team combination",10
2024-04-22 06:38:42 PM IST,"Yeah they will win that how the script is all about in IPL

also RR has reached first half pinnacle it's downhill from here",6
2024-04-22 06:41:58 PM IST,Hoping for some Jos the Boss magic today,3
2024-04-22 06:47:33 PM IST,"So, do we play Boult or get Maharaj?",2
2024-04-22 06:50:18 PM IST,"Whatever happens today, Rohit will flick Boult for a couple of boundaries today",2
2024-04-22 06:52:47 PM IST,"This should've been the last league game. 

MI have stormed back into qualification, on 4th place. RR have began choking, placed on 5th. 

MI bat first, score 190. RR need to get 191 in 13 to qualify. Last ball 2 to win, but jurel is run out. Now they need a boundary to win. Coetzee steaming in. Ethical Anna on strike. Ashwin smokes this over square leg, Ambani throws his cap on the floor.",75
2024-04-22 06:56:43 PM IST,Let's go. I'm still so unsure about our bowling. Looks toothless except Bumrah of course.,2
2024-04-22 06:58:26 PM IST,Nice analysis by Eoin Morgan on Jaiswal why he's not working this year.,5

2024-04-22 07:02:18 PM IST,Nuwan comes in place of Romario. (Nabi still gonna play),2
2024-04-22 07:02:24 PM IST,"So we'll probably only go with 5 bowlers. 
We'll come with Rovman to bolster batting",1
2024-04-22 07:02:29 PM IST,THUSHARA AND NEHAL ARE IN FUCK YEAAAHHH,12
2024-04-22 07:02:32 PM IST,Why Gopal out?,1
2024-04-22 07:02:46 PM IST,"Woah MI chose to bat, wasn't expecting. Good move?",2
2024-04-22 07:02:52 PM IST,"Give us the trophy already - Nuwan and Nehal are back in, which means the team is thinking in the correct direction

7 matches down is generally when we get our final winning combination",8
2024-04-22 07:02:56 PM IST,Hardik probably believes most on lord Boom boom to defend anything,1
2024-04-22 07:03:05 PM IST,YEAHHHH BOY NUWAN IS BACK BOYS,7
2024-04-22 07:03:06 PM IST,I mean everyone was begging for these 2 and now even with them if we lose then the season is gone fs,5

2024-04-22 07:04:22 PM IST,"Facing Sandeep while chasing would have been frustrating, especially with our recent record of choking the chases against slow ball. Good that we are batting first",7
2024-04-22 07:04:34 PM IST,SANDEEP PLS PERFORM I DON'T WANT SIRAJ IN WC.,9
2024-04-22 07:04:46 PM IST,Would happily take another 190 today,1
2024-04-22 07:04:50 PM IST,SO EXCITED FOR MALINGA 3.0,9
2024-04-22 07:04:50 PM IST,"Love that Nuwan and Wadhera are in, but why Chawla",5
2024-04-22 07:04:54 PM IST,Gopal and chawla might be controversial but other than that it's the best 10 for mi,2
2024-04-22 07:05:00 PM IST,Bumrah from alibaba back for RR,6
2024-04-22 07:05:34 PM IST,"Ight thushara nice. also is it just me or isnt shepherd better than nabi lol, shepherds a wayy better finisher. nabi is a better bowler but is of no use cause hardik cba bowling him, what even is nabis role",4

2024-04-22 07:06:45 PM IST,I like chawla but why would you get gopal out you didn't even use him properly in any game.,1
2024-04-22 07:06:49 PM IST,"Guys, Chawla is better and smarter than Shreyas tbh. And probably Hardik trusts him more 

But Shreyas should have got a game at Sawai Mansingh, where he has played so many games, especially when he hasn't had a bad match as such. Let's see how this pans out",18
2024-04-22 07:07:00 PM IST,"No football today, pls. This is the most I ask today.",3
2024-04-22 07:07:04 PM IST,"Perfect changes:

2024-04-22 07:08:10 PM IST,Mumbai back to two overseas pacers,3
2024-04-22 07:08:33 PM IST,Interesting selection from MI. Is Wadhera even a finisher? And didn't they prefer Naman Dhir over him early on?,3
2024-04-22 07:08:40 PM IST,When hardik said 3 guys are out i thought nabi made out of playing xi for putting that story,10
2024-04-22 07:09:27 PM IST,"So, if David or anyone from MI CHEATS again, will they still get 20% fine. Or 50%?",5
2024-04-22 07:10:31 PM IST,Solid batting till 8 but just 4 bowlers + impact bowler + Hardik,2
2024-04-22 07:12:01 PM IST,Bit harsh on Shepherd,1
2024-04-22 07:12:35 PM IST,"Just curious why did Samson say this at the toss:

**Sanju Samson | RR captain:** We had a slightly different idea about the toss so it’s okay.",1

2024-04-22 09:04:16 PM IST,I think Hardik should come a bit early. Take some balls to settle and then play as we know he used to  He is a good batsman but I think he comes at such stress full time (17-20 overs) that he has to get some runs immediately AND GETS FUCKIN OUT very early,3

2024-04-22 09:11:26 PM IST,Rohit Kishan Sky Hardik all duds,2
2024-04-22 09:11:29 PM IST,Hardik pandya is not a finisher. He will do well to learn this and come to bat earlier like a proper middle order basman.,7
2024-04-22 09:11:30 PM IST,Sandy is so so good as of late,3
2024-04-22 09:11:31 PM IST,"200 looked certain at 1 point, excellent comeback from RR. 185 odd they would be favourites I think, specially as it is their home ground.....",4
2024-04-22 09:11:32 PM IST,This pandu broke all momentum,5
2024-04-22 09:11:33 PM IST,"Everytime I try to be less pissed on Pandu, he does something worthy. 

Should've just given Tilak the strike.",15
2024-04-22 09:11:34 PM IST,Tilak did his best.,3
2024-04-22 09:11:34 PM IST,Bowl at coetzee for maximum balls this over and keep them under 180,3
2024-04-22 09:11:34 PM IST,Tilak lost momentum staying on non-striker end with no team runs.,19
2024-04-22 09:11:36 PM IST,Completely killed the momentum... did pandu,11
2024-04-22 09:11:38 PM IST,"Cant strike, can't bowl, poor captaincy , shit attitude, smug face... God I hate Pandya",22
2024-04-22 09:11:43 PM IST,So rr is great in death and powerplay but their mid over bowling is lacking due to ashwin not taking wickets,4
2024-04-22 09:11:44 PM IST,"Pandya came killed all the momentum,pandya gone...",8
2024-04-22 09:11:44 PM IST,"Captain's innings, a slashing 10(10) to completely change the game",10
2024-04-22 09:11:46 PM IST,Waste of the middle overs batting. Ass saving inning nonetheless by Tilak.,6
2024-04-22 09:11:46 PM IST,No way pandya is that bad. I think he has some hate fetishism. Anything else doesn’t make sense.,8
2024-04-22 09:11:47 PM IST,You guys are seriously wild if you think pandya is not gonna be on that plane.,8
2024-04-22 09:11:49 PM IST,"Mostly outsider players are performing well in this ipl, and the indians performing well won’t be playing in the upcoming t20 WC.",6
2024-04-22 09:11:50 PM IST,Hardik being the difference between win and loss once again. Dude should drop himself off the team and give Bumrah or SKY the captaincy if he has any shame left in him.,7
2024-04-22 09:11:51 PM IST,Hardik getting captaincy only to most probably lose his T20 WC spot is one of those genie wishes which come with an evil catch ,4
2024-04-22 09:11:52 PM IST,"Pandya has lost us so many matches, it's not even funny. Forget about being captain, this guy shouldn't even be in starting 11",9
2024-04-22 09:11:55 PM IST,RR were sleeping between 5 th over to 17 th over,3
2024-04-22 09:11:57 PM IST,From 200 to praying to cross 190... Well thank you captain,3
2024-04-22 09:11:58 PM IST,"Considering we were 20/3, this is still a good score but it could've been better in the death overs.",2
2024-04-22 09:11:59 PM IST,Shitty dj playin shitty songs lol,1
2024-04-22 09:11:59 PM IST,Pandya and David completely derailed a possibly 200+,1

2024-04-22 09:12:02 PM IST,People trolled and boo'd pandya and now they want to see him perform well for ICT in WC,5
2024-04-22 09:12:06 PM IST,"Jaipur folks - what's a par score on this pitch? If MI gets to ~185, is that a defendable total or can I say ""sayonara Mumbai, see you next year"" lol",1
2024-04-22 09:12:06 PM IST,It's Pandya again who ruined the momentum for MI. Not able to strike and let Tilak off strike and get out at a very wrong time.,2
2024-04-22 09:12:06 PM IST,This is the 3rd game this season when Mumbai is going strong and Pandya comes and completely kills the momentum and derails the innings,3
2024-04-22 09:12:07 PM IST,could have been an easy 200 total man,2
2024-04-22 09:12:08 PM IST,It could have been an easy 200+ after 15 but then Hardik Pandya walked in onto the field,3
2024-04-22 09:12:08 PM IST,Amazing how clinical Pandya was in wasting tilak and wadheras partnership. It’s mind boggling,8
2024-04-22 09:12:12 PM IST,SKY looks so proud of Tilak. Mentor-disciple vibes.,3
2024-04-22 09:12:12 PM IST,Sandeep Sharma woke up and said W,1
2024-04-22 09:12:14 PM IST,"Avesh only bowled one really bad ball this over, and got wicket on that ball.",2
2024-04-22 09:12:16 PM IST,Missing pandya/Pollard in this team as we have now clown David to replace the two great finishers we lost.,0
2024-04-22 09:12:17 PM IST,send Pandya to the same ayurveda resort that Thomas Tuchel went to after Chelsea. bro needs some healing after this season.,3
2024-04-22 09:12:18 PM IST,"nah it was looking 200 at one point, unless one wanna-be cool captain barged in without looking at situation and lost the momentum",2
2024-04-22 09:12:18 PM IST,So Fukkboi is out of form with Bat and Ball. True 3D player.,6
2024-04-22 09:12:20 PM IST,Sandeep should be a lock in for the world cup.,3
2024-04-22 09:12:20 PM IST,This Iranian track has become irritating,7

2024-04-22 09:12:22 PM IST,"Everytime MI gets momentum, Hardik walks in casually and makes MI lose the match ! Every fuckkingg time Why!!!",11
2024-04-22 09:12:22 PM IST,Single-handedly killed the momentum. Gandik Haggya.,7
2024-04-22 09:12:31 PM IST,IPL DJs for some reason seem to love the Bobby Deol song from animal movie,8
2024-04-22 09:12:31 PM IST,Wow great fielding out of nowhere,2
2024-04-22 09:12:32 PM IST,"Pandya is done bro. We've been trying to go back to his 2019-20 form for 4-5 years now, it's just not there anymore. His bowling is 10 kph slower than it used to be, and his batting has gone from hitting it 20 rows into the stands to barely clearing the 30m circle. He could maybe be an anchor like he was for GT in 2022, but Indian cricket doesn't need more of those. It's over. The sooner we start to look to the future the better it will be for Indian cricket",8
2024-04-22 09:12:33 PM IST,Hardik trade fked up MI,6

2024-04-22 09:12:37 PM IST,Suffice to say Pandya’s entry killed this innings,7
2024-04-22 09:12:37 PM IST,Rr middle overs sucks man,2
2024-04-22 09:12:38 PM IST,"Forget captaincy, why is Pandya’s spot in MI not under question? What has he actually done so far? I remember two short decent innings in 8 games. No bowling contribution. Dropped catches.",16
2024-04-22 09:12:38 PM IST,"How fucking unnecessary was Hardik for MI?!. We reached playoffs with a worse bowling line up. With Bumrah back, Green at 3, and a united dressing room under Rohit, MI could have been a top 2 contender this year. They have destroyed this franchise, like Hardik destroyed the momentum today after Nehal's wicket",20

We're seeing so many times that the bowler runs in but the batter isn't ready, the batter isn't even looking. And then the bowler has to go back. This is the responsibility of the umpire, to make the bowler know that the batter isn't ready yet, by extending one of the arms. The umpire can also ask the batter to move on with it if needed. But unless the batter is ready, the umpire has to keep their arm extended so that the bowler knows. This is one of the first things we're taught in umpiring. (I haven't taken a course, but played for a club when I was little and umpired in a few club games).",2

Hardik last match against punjab 

6th over- when the top order was already collapsed and both the batsmen were playing slow gave himself an easy over. (Genuinely nice over)

8th over - got some confidence because of previous over decided to bowl again when 1 batsmen got out in 7th over (so probably another easy over still conceded 10 runs)

12th over- Average bowling (conceded 11 runs)

19th over- Returns when only bowlers are left and all the batsmen are gone (gets a wicket ) (tonked for a 6 by rabada) (gave 11 runs in total when 2 tail enders were on crease)

Overall- 4 over 33 runs 1 wicket 

Looks nice over all and he regains some confidence 

Next match vs rr- Gives himself the first over thinking he bowled good last match is regaining his form etc etc (11 runs conceded ) and not seen again in the powerplay.",9

2024-04-22 11:17:56 PM IST,From the body language of the MI players you can tell that the dressing room situation is not normal. It doesn't seem like Hardik is able to motivate or energize his players or have the control over the dressing room that he should. It's very difficult to do when you don't have the support of the senior players. It was also evident in the way Nabi reposted a story on Instagram questioning MI management's decision to not bowl him and bat him lower in the order. In a well gelled team players won't show public dissent like this.,11

2024-04-22 11:49:02 PM IST,"Definitely, defendable. But they batted pretty well and Jaiswal was the difference. They were smart with their plans and used the boundary well. They got the hang of it and they have a man behind the stumps telling them what's working - Sanju. The ball was slightly gripping and they got ahead of the game. Until Jaiswal came blazing, we were on course for the total. It was just about what was best at that point. To seamers it was more difficult to hit on this wicket. We are now on the road for the loss in next few games. If we are smart, we can get the goal we want.

2024-04-23 12:03:53 AM IST,Samson is the real captain material. Praised not only his own team but the opponent players as well,72
2024-04-23 12:03:57 AM IST,"The last mega auction didn't work out for MI at all especially considering they won 3 of the 5 seasons prior to it. Archer's purchase was touted as some Genius move but didn't work out for them. They overpaid for Ishan Kishan and retained Brewis & Tim David over Stubbs and lost their PP strike bowler Boult to RR in the auction. And to top it all, this year they created this huge mess with Pandya.",24

2024-04-23 12:05:49 AM IST,now this is wholesome,9
2024-04-23 12:05:50 AM IST,Calling that celebration randoms says how genuinely wholesome the camp is,20
2024-04-23 12:06:47 AM IST,Does anyone know about that jaiswal's comment on a random girl's insta post,-5

2024-04-23 12:11:43 AM IST,So Hardik did double specialisation from tuk tuk and dinda academies,33
2024-04-23 12:12:04 AM IST,"Hardik Pandya: We put ourselves in trouble early on. The way Tilak and Nehal batted - that was fantastic. I don't think that when we lost a couple of wickets early we thought we would even reach 180. We didn't finish well and that's why we were 10-15 runs short. We had to keep it within the stumps (while bowling). Early on in the powerplay, we gave a lot of width and I don't think it was our best day in the field as well. Overall, we did not put the right foot on the park and eventually they outplayed us. After the game, it's not the right time to go to the players, everyone is professional, they know their roles. What we can do is learn from this game and the mistakes which we have made, rectify it and make sure that we don't make it. Progression is very important. Within the team, individually, we will have to accept our flaws and maybe work on those. I don't believe much in chip and chop, I like to back players and the focus would always be to play good cricket, sticking to our plans and making sure that we don't make the basic errors. **Cricket is simple, as long as we keep it simple, it's nice.**",18
2024-04-23 12:12:05 AM IST,samson 🙌,17

2024-04-23 12:17:35 AM IST,I'm shocked how even Bumrah did not work here,16
2024-04-23 12:21:44 AM IST,"The funniest part of this MI-Pandya-GT drama is how badly it affected RCB. Without Green, Will Jacks would have started in XI much before but more importantly with the additional purse available, they might have gotten Cummins. IIRC, they went hard for him until their purse was about to expire. They could have transferred the captaincy and for all we know Maxwell would have been Maxwelling under Cummins.",49
2024-04-23 12:42:02 AM IST,Jaiswal with Butler's celebration was cherry on top of this match.,21
2024-04-23 12:59:49 AM IST,Butler was furious with MI team that no one made century so he got himself out without one what a bad day for him,22
2024-04-23 03:03:05 AM IST,"Watching MI being annihilated is priceless, for everything else there's Mastercard. ",25
2024-04-23 03:31:46 AM IST,Hardik is indeed turning out to be an abjectly bad leader. It seems that it wasn't just some random things that he did or the pressure that was on him during the previous matches. He keeps making decisions that are nonsensical during all the time. The order that the bowlers bowled in with the new ball was completely haphazard. There was no proper plan that was there.,18
2024-04-23 06:44:07 AM IST,Can Pandya take the bold decision and rest himself for the next match... Not like MI don't have a player with captaincy experience...,9
2024-04-23 06:50:49 AM IST,11K comments is crazy,11
2024-04-23 06:52:49 AM IST,All that fuss about Thushara...,12
