2024-05-15 06:37:51 PM IST,RR literally went on a 3 match losing streak so they could match up in quality with bottom placed PBKS for L classico. Couple goals.,13
2024-05-15 06:38:55 PM IST,"RR should go back to how it started and just make the replacements.

1. Yashasvi
2. Kohler-Cadmore \*
3. Sanju
4. Riyan
5. Jurel
6. Hetty / Donovan / Powell \*
7. Ashwin
8. Boult \*
9. Burger \*
10. Avesh
11. Chahal
12. IP : Sandeep / Shubham

Works both batting and bowling first. After Burger's injury and the miss, the team took different shape slowly every game. Roles got changed too much. Sandeep was superb as death overs specialist. Keep him for that one role. Mohit and Sandeep are done with new ball here.",3

2024-05-15 07:03:02 PM IST,I feel that's a mistake from RR. Should have bowled first and chase the target set by PBKS. Guwahati ground is generally high scoring and I am pretty sure that would be some dew at the very least.,3
2024-05-15 07:03:13 PM IST,"everyone was saying there is dew but sanju is saying there is no dew according to their experts.

Kohli and Patel have improved tremendously in the 2nd half but they haven't been better than Head oe Bumrah.

I much prefer we abolish those outdated cap system or use some advanced model like Cricinfo and Cricviz which take SR and pitch into account. I quite like the SA20 where Klaasen despite being the 2nd leading run scorer was rewarded best batsman and player of the tournament due to his impact.",-1
