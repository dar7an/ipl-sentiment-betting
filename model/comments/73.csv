Rock hard pitch, but not dry. 60m on one side and 75m on the other, 77m straight.

A lot for steamers, not a lot for spinners.

Super high humidity so expect a ton of dew.

Considering all that, win toss, chase, win. Or be like Hyderabad in Q1, win toss, bat first, fold cheaply against Boult cos it's a seamers pitch, lose.",2

Secondly, do you think Parag will be bid by other teams if he's in the auction? Of course. Teams like GT and PBKS will give up anything to get a middle order player like him.

Now ask the same question about Arjun Tendulkar. Will any team be interested in buying him aside from MI?",3

With dew in the second inning and their spin attack not being that great, they need to give their bowlers a cushion of extra runs to defend. They also need to try something new when they come to bowl. If they put up a big total, the pressure will be on RR, as they will have to attack throughout the entire inning, creating chances for wickets. RR doesn't have a deep batting lineup after Ashwin, and the batting form of a few RR players isn't that great, although they are capable enough to pull it off. Therefore, SRH should focus on putting up a big total.",8

Chose Samson as captain and kicked out both Smith and Rahane who had been with RR for a long time

Developed Jaiswal, Parag and Jurel 

Revived Avesh and Sandeep careers especially Avesh he was memed and trolled after the whole fever thing in Asia Cup and LSG dropped him as well 

Even when the trade happened a lot of people felt LSG got the better trade as DDP was in really good domestic form and Avesh didn't have a good IPL

This is the closest he has looked like 2021 DC Avesh tbh

2024-05-24 09:31:56 PM IST,"If even two batsman from our absolutely terrible middle order today gave us at least 10 more runs each, this would be looking so good. NKR was the most disappointing imo, focusing on getting that switch shot right instead of sticking to the role he needed to play today, that sorta stubbornness never works out, just let it go after you fail thrice bro. Kinda braindead too cus the whole point of a switch shot is to hit it on the side there aren't many fielders, there literally were three of em there. He talks sm about wanting to get SRH out of sticky situations and how that's his role and yet that's what he chose to do in a high stakes game like this.

Dunno what we'd have done without that start and Klaasen. Just glad there doesn't seem to be some dew and that it feels like it's gotten tougher to bat on.",3

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to CUMMINS. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.

Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

I won't comment much on his captaincy decisions cause I have no clarity who decides what between Sanju and Sanga. But the decisions themselves have been mediocre too and the thing that's infuriating is that they have been doing the same old mistakes in the last 3 seasons - no 6th bowling option, backing Ashwin's batting over regular batters, lack of ARs, etc. 

The squad is actually the best squad in the whole cycle which makes it such a shame that they are gona end up with nothing to show for in the trophy cabinet.
