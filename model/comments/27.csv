A new stadium is definitely warranted in the state of Punjab, however I cannot understand why Amritsar city was not considered -  Decent population, more 'massy' population (Chandigarh is a city of elites - judges, lawyers, adminsitrators and hence the residents are less likely to go to stadiums), good flight connections domestically and internationally.",9

Why do we even need umpires when literally all dismissals can be more accurately judged using technology in this day and age? It's a game where a single wrong decision by umpire can potentially change the course of the match. In that case why not just delegate the job of deciding out/ not out entirely to technology. Umpires can remain on the ground just to ensure smooth conduct of the game. No umpires call drama, no leaning towards ""on field call"" when the third umpire doesn't have ""conclusive"" evidence to overturn. Just technology all the way through is better imo.",6

2024-04-13 10:08:24 PM IST,Its so unfair to kotian. He is a lower order offspinner who can hold his bat and get runs in a test match. Sending him top and him struggling along with not giving him bowling at all is just ridiculous. That too on ipl debut.,28
2024-04-13 10:08:26 PM IST,I feel for Kotian. Been following his domestic stint. He is not a T20 player like many. I'd put Akashdeep and Sarfaraz in that bracket. Everyone can't be good at everything.,7
2024-04-13 10:08:26 PM IST,Why not Chahal as openor,7

2024-04-13 10:09:30 PM IST,They could send Boult or Sen to open along with Jaiswal. What was that shit ? Ducking wasted 31 balls. He should have thrown his wicket after 10-15 balls.  Feeling like Rajasthan doesnt want to win the match.,1

2024-04-13 11:23:27 PM IST,"Hetmeyer is class. I mean that in every way. But he is pigeonholed by RR as a finisher/hitter/slogger. He happens to be a case he is a great finisher because he is a very good batter. They hold him back to long. He needs to bat at 5 so he can bat as many balls and not just the pure death. He handles pressure well. He bats well to spin and pace. Imagine if hetmeyer has 10-15 balls under his belt before the 16th over starts. 

But RR will never learn. They love doing this out of the box thinking that ensures their very well balanced and well skilled team finishes 5th. They even do dumb things like promoting Ashwin to 5 if the top 3 get out cheap. Its hilarious. Hoping common sense prevails this year.",29
