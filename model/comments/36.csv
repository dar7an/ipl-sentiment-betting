2024-04-21 06:05:52 PM IST,Because Virat played the ball earlier too he played it at above waist height. This is why he felt it was a no ball. But the trajectory clearly showed below waist height. So it was a legit delivery,6
2024-04-21 06:05:52 PM IST,"Even if that wasn’t technically a no ball, it’s very hard for the batsman to hit. It should be objective based on the delivery. Kohli should’ve just hit it down or just left it once he realized it was too high, that shot was pretty bad",4

2024-04-21 06:23:01 PM IST,"I don’t know why RCB gets unilateral hate. Yes, we don’t like when our fans abuse players for no rhyme or reason. They did it to Dan Christian’s WIFE which was so gross.    

But, it’s a subcontinent problem. RCB has more fans than let’s say RR, so you’ll see more toxicity in total from RCB. Just like how india has more population than Australia so you’ll see more toxicity from Indian fans than Aussie.    

Indian fans abused Dhoni and burnt effigies. Indians created an uproar when Harbhajan posed for an ad with a groomed/shaved beard. Indians pelted stones at ICT homes. Indians trolled Bumrah saying he only shows up for IPL and not for “National duty” (cringe). Indians are booing hardik left-right knowing we don’t have a single replacement for him, especially with what mugs our ICT pacers are with the bat. Dhoni fans act crazy on SM. They booed Jadeja and cheered for him to get out last year. Some Rohit stans are mad on Twitter, putting “Chokli” down every opportunity they get. 

So this is NOT an RCB problem. There’s literally nothing different culturally about RCB fans than others. It’s just strength in numbers in display.",16

Case in point - Will Jacks getting out and then that ridiculous shot from Pattidar. RCB needed under 10 runs per over. They lost a wicket in that very over. 

The game was with them. Then Cam Green comes in and tries to smack every ball and gets out. Sends in Lomror who doesn't last either. 

Now they have exposed their entire batting and finisher DK. They might still win this, but this is brain dead cricket. 

If it works, you get 250 scores from SRH, if it doesn't, it's frankly horrible to watch.",6

2024-04-21 07:20:16 PM IST,"Here is my thought on the decision where Kohli was adjudjed out based on technology...
If the batsman moves to his right or left in the crease and that has an impact on weather it is a wide delivery or not.. That means the position of batsman is taken into consideration.. Then why is it not the case of Kohli wicket where the technology says if Kohli was inside the crease it's not above waist... Why don't they say.. The batsman has moved and that has to have an impact on the waist high call so when Kohli's bat met the ball.. It was waist high... Think about it..",-1
