2024-03-24 09:22:57 PM IST,Only 3 boundries conceded by Bumrah and coetzee. And only 1 in 4 overs in the death. Unreal stuff.,21
2024-03-24 09:23:22 PM IST,I feel like the IPL is too easy for Bumrah now. It's a shame the windows don't line up and Indian players can't play in overseas T20 leagues because if the Hundred was before the T20WC India could have sent him to England and got him some elite white ball practice.,7
2024-03-24 09:23:25 PM IST,GT definitely made some questionable decisions with their order. Like sending Shankar before Rashid. Also why keep Kane out?,9
2024-03-24 09:23:32 PM IST,Anyone got stats on whether this new Smart Replay System has saved time? Still feels like reviews take forever.,6

2024-03-24 09:25:39 PM IST,So after all it was good captaincy to restrict GT at 168?,3

2024-03-24 09:26:56 PM IST,Calling this..MI will lose by 10 runs..Umesh and Rashid to take bulk of the wickets,3
2024-03-24 09:26:57 PM IST,Bumrah need a reliable partner at death over  and we need a reliable wicket taker in the powerplay since there is no point in bumrah bowling 2 overs in powerplay,5
2024-03-24 09:27:01 PM IST,We need a Rashid masterclass here.,4

2024-03-24 09:28:20 PM IST,"You can hate Pandya the captain, but you can't hate Pandya the player. An Indian Pacer all-rounder, now that's rare. He will get a really high bid if MI even releases him.",9
2024-03-24 09:28:23 PM IST,"Mega auctions are so dumb. A cycle being 3 seasons gives no time to 'develop' players and build a team. If you do try to do that, you just end up losing those players when the cycle ends.",21

2024-03-24 09:55:30 PM IST,"One of my least favourite things about the IPL is that it's completely accepted that you take a punt on bowlers like Burger, Coetzee, Omarzai, Luke Wood, Spencer Johnson, but bowlers like Karthik Tyagi and Mayank Yadav just sit on the bench. 

You can replace any of those overseas seamers with plenty of other overseas seamers from the past season.

Maphaka gets an IPL contract based on his U19 world cup, but Himanshu Chauhan carries Delhi's Ranji team on his back and I'm not even sure he has an IPL team?

All the overseas bowlers I mentioned are wonderful and talented and you don't blame the teams for playing them but how are India supposed to get quicks for their national team when bowlers like Mohit Sharma or Akash Madhwal get games over young bowlers with pace and bounce?

This competition incentivizes franchises to fill their overseas slots on x factor overseas bowlers and batters alongside whatever marquee Indian players they have and then pad the rest of the team with bits and pieces domestic cricketers for balance's sake.

No wonder all our T20I seam bowling picks look so pedestrian outside like Bumrah and a couple of others.",23
