2024-05-17 07:32:59 PM IST,"I don't get the hate for Arjun Tendulkar playing today.

The guy bowled reasonably well in the powerplay last year. 0/17(2.0) vKKR 1/18(2.5) vSRH, and 1/9(2.0) vGT with one terrible match against PBKS 1/48(3.0)

Those are respectable numbers for anyone. And his Domestic T20 strike rate is 14.8 ^(which is better than Mukesh Kumar, Arshdeep, Avesh, Harshal Patel, Chetan Sakariya, T Natarajan, Khaleel, N Saini, D Chahar, all whom have debuted for India)

Yes, his stats are on a small sample size, but ffs, they're completely fine, and _technically_ better than every fast bowler who's debuted for India in the last 5 years at least. I'm not saying he's at the level of Natarajan, Arshdeep or any of them.

But chill the fuck out with the nepotism claims. What you're saying is basically **""He doesn't deserve to play because his father is a legend, unlike other player"".** And you guys wonder why a few players take mental health breaks.",1

Looks like the weight of Tendulkar surname is not gonna help him at all. Personally feel if he moves to another franchise next year and be evolve in team more this will help him more,3

2024-05-17 09:11:17 PM IST,"In potential defense of Rahul, LSG's batting overall isn't very deep, which kind of demands someone consistent. There's only a couple of bats on the team with the potential to go huge, and only 1 with any consistency. 

Rahul doesn't attack the power play well, but he does milk the middle overs and rotate well, accelerating if he lasts long enough. Usually he plays a run a ball until 'fixing it' to a 130-150 later on, this would actually be okay if you've got a pooran at the other side all the time. If you were building a team and HAD to have Rahul, aggressive openers and Rahul coming in when there's a collapse or just outside the power play would probably be the best use of him.",6

So many times he was trying that slower wide one with the ball, when it's a known fact that he's at his best when he's clicking 140 at length/back of length.

2024-05-18 12:25:09 AM IST,MI sorta shows why Australia is a stellar team. AUS may not have the best players in form every time but has excellent dressing room environments and then theres MI that cant win even with a star studded line up,8
2024-05-18 12:25:19 AM IST,Hardik was trying to keep his usual smug smile while remembering about not to overdo that given that this has been a bad tournament very calculatively.,19

2021 and 2022 were fine, 2023 did not expect that team to make it as far as it did. After end of 2023 season, 2024 is the time when I felt it's time for MI to win again and that's when MI had its worst season.
