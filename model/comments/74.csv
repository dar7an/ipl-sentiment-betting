Harshit starts smooching Cumdawg when he tries to silence him. Shreyas removes his jersey and starts showing off his Ramraj banyan. Varun stares into the souls of the audience. A wild Narine says, “I chuck, I chuck,” loudly. But wait, there’s more. A wild Neeraj Chopra approaches, removes his wig, and guess what, it’s Suyyash Sharma. Kingku goes on his knees and proposes to Suhana. The ground goes silent. A sad, tensed-up Kavya runs to the ground, stops the proposal, and is on her knees to propose to Kingku. SRK begs Kingku to reject her. Kavya says, “If Kingku says yes, you can have the IPL trophy.” SRK rejects the offer, saying, “I only want Kingku.” GG says, “Ek rejection ne aapko IPL trophy nhi dilayi hai.” Kingku says, “I want you, Shah Rukh. I thought Suhana was you in a wig.” But wait, Chandu cuts the sleeves of Kingku, revealing a new tattoo with the golden prophecy written on it: “THALA FOR A REASON.” The whole ground starts chanting, “CSK! CSK!” Whistles echo. SRH and KKR teammates start having an orgy while Thala comes and takes away the trophy, saying, “Thala for a reason and Thala for another season.” In the end, Harshit Rana gets a ban for 7 seasons.",32

In the third final, they ended up batting first again. They put up a bigger total than the average of their last two totals (178). They started well in the second innings too, before losing by a quite comfortable margin in the end.

Man I really like Starc but stop with these comments already now. Rohit-Virat have hit Starc enough by now and he doesn’t bother them anymore especially Rohit. Go watch the Aus last ODI before the WC or the WC Final itself. We are over Starc and he isn’t even the same anymore. Starc has officially lost the sharpness he had pre-2020.",-2

The iconic Eden Gardens erupted in jubilation as Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) clinched their third IPL title, defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in a nail-biting final on Sunday. Amidst deafening roars from the packed stands, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise etched their name in IPL folklore once again, adding another glorious chapter to their storied legacy.

While star performers like Venkatesh Iyer and Nitish Rana played their part, it was the unheralded Rinku Singh who truly stole the show. With KKR teetering at 89/5 in their pursuit of 174, the left-hander displayed nerves of steel, smashing an unbeaten 42 off just 28 deliveries to guide his team home.

For SRH, Pat Cummins led from the front, both with the ball and the bat. The Australian spearhead claimed three crucial wickets before contributing a blistering 33 off just 18 balls. However, his efforts ultimately fell short as KKR held their nerve in the closing stages.",9

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Pat. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",8

Is a team where captains play a huge role in man management,  looking at Morgan, Gambhir and now Iyer, unlike MI and CSK where there has been practically a single captain. Iconic foreign players like Kallis, Lee, Shakib, Narine, Russell and now Starc have played integral parts in their campaigns. 

Also has probably the least delusional and social media aggressive fans despite their high success, fans who actually understand cricket. Their home ground is one of the most iconic grounds in the world.

Also SRK and thus, has a huge Bollywood support surpassed only by MI perhaps (Not that it pertains to cricket).",12

~~Everyone predicted SRH to score 300~~

Reality is that Everyone predicted SRH to finish on 10 in the table

So yeah we've overachieved quite a bit and they have made fans like me proud. 277, 287, 266, 1 run win vs RR, 167 in 9.4 overs, spin choke in Q2... Tons of good memories after disastrous 3 seasons. All in all a great season, thanks to Cummins, Dan and all the players. See you next year.",1
