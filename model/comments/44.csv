2024-04-27 09:04:21 PM IST,"Poor bowlers have to face the brunt of market forces of the IPL franchise. This season the pitches look doctored to favor the batters. The organizers would've made a conscious effort to give more bang for the buck to the audience, more sixes and fours during a game, so the audience can wave them flags that were sold to them more often, twice an over or something.

They want the matches to last longer purely for economic reasons. They have like 25k to 50k people at any given venue. They want them to be there longer, so they can get them to spend more at the venue(s). Low-scoring games that end early, with boring defensive cricket on display, where bowlers come out of top doesn't help sales and commerce.  This is like a big party for the audience, they want to dance every over, celebrate every boundary/six.

It's commercial entertainment. they want to pack more action in 40 over bandwidth they're working with. More runs per game was a no-brainer, to get more leverage out of the audience.

IPL is a good example of how economics can influence the evolution of a given sport.

Hardik Pandya | MI Captain: This game is becoming more and more closer. It (the difference) used to be a couple of overs, now it’s becoming a couple of balls. Because of the kind of games and how the bowlers are under pressure, we backed ourselves to do it. If I had to pick something out, we could have taken a couple of more chances in the middle overs. The left-handers could have probably gone after Axar a little bit, it’s something we missed out in terms of game awareness. It was quite amazing the way he (Fraser-McGurk) batted, he took calculated risks, he played the field really well. It shows the fearlessness of youth. (If he would’ve done something different at the toss) Not really.

Left handers he mean Tilak? Shame that’s some shit to say. Didn’t even appreciate his effort",10

If ICC = BCCI and in that case if BCCI is going to prepare pitches in the upcoming T20WC, they’ll probably make it as flat as this year’s IPL since that is all Indian batters would’ve been practicing for 2.5 months just before WC begins. Why would they give their batters a road in the IPL and slow, sluggish, spin tracks in the WC. Should we expect 220+ games in the WC too?

2024-04-27 11:29:09 PM IST,"Holy shit

Ian Bishop is going to interview Sanju Samson


Those who don't know Bish is one of Sanju's biggest promoters , he always praises Sanju's talent would love to see what he asks",35
2024-04-27 11:29:12 PM IST,Those people who were saying Samson can't bat fck yall this guy always gets mistaken it's sad.,26
2024-04-27 11:29:24 PM IST,Jurel isn't in the race to be the wicketkeeper that goes to West Indies but it is good that another wicketkeeper has started to play well. We don't have any shortages there anymore. Sanju and Rishabh are obviously the primary choices that are there.,10

2024-04-27 11:30:16 PM IST,Sanju bagging all awards lmao,32
2024-04-27 11:30:43 PM IST,"Let's not build Sanju up too much... In modern parlance, let's ""let him cook"" and hope he does it well going forward too. Indian selection is always a complicated affair usually showing characteristics of both government and private job appointments, with the permanent nature of the government job applicable for certain individuals, and many ""back door"" appointments characteristic of both types of jobs– it's all about who you're thick with in the employment world, much like Indian cricket.",-8
2024-04-27 11:30:51 PM IST,"I repeat, Ian Bishop and Sanju Samson are a great combo!",31

A lot of help from Dhruv Jurel though!",22
2024-04-27 11:34:10 PM IST,Sanju is blushing in front of Bishop lol so cute,27
2024-04-27 11:34:48 PM IST,To be very honest,10
2024-04-27 11:35:12 PM IST,"Bishop: Any boxes still left to check for the team?

2024-04-27 11:42:34 PM IST,"Jurel may not be in contention for WC but I'm damn happy for him 

We for backup for Pant in test who is not only good at keeping but also plays when team needs the most 

He is young 

Can be good prospect in limited overs if he keeps like this...",20

2024-04-27 11:45:07 PM IST,So what other teams other than Punjab are making the play offs?,8
2024-04-27 11:45:55 PM IST,It makes more sense to take more risks to hit more sixes because it takes fielding out of the equation.,1
2024-04-27 11:47:06 PM IST,"If RR ends up winning IPL this season 

It will be up there with MI 2020 and GT 2022 being dominant team all over the tournament....",22
2024-04-27 11:47:23 PM IST,"Nice to see the commentators KP, Haydos, Bishop praising Samson and how he has missed out on selection.",24
2024-04-27 11:48:09 PM IST,Imo an ideal Indian team would have both Sanju and Pant playing ,13

2024-04-28 02:29:16 AM IST,Why should Rohit go to WC? Man has done nothing in T20i to justify his spot,10
2024-04-28 05:56:18 AM IST,RR has maintained the performances that they had instead of falling down from a cliff in that way that they did during the previous tournament.,13
2024-04-28 03:35:02 PM IST,"why is saha still playing, dude looks older than sachin and frailer than chahal",2
