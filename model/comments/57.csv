2024-05-08 07:47:54 PM IST,"Dear KL


Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your ORANGE CAP. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for LSG this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of LSG on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 ORANGE CAP.

I don't think LSG will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

2024-05-08 10:52:42 PM IST,This Goenka always seems like an arrogant older man from some remote village who got 200-400 acres of paternal property without doing anything and think himself of some prime minister like stature. (Don't know about his business or struggle but by face and attitude he seems like that old man),19

2024-05-08 10:54:32 PM IST,"Money can't buy class, you proved the quote right today Mr. Goenka",20
2024-05-08 10:55:20 PM IST,"I'm simply speechless, that was a ruthless chase by SRH. As India is heading into the T20 WC 24, they have to watch out for Travis Head, they have to do a million reruns of videos of him getting out to see what his weaknesses are, at the moment he is looking invincible.",12
2024-05-08 10:55:28 PM IST,Goenka is a seasoned businessman so he should know better than to yell at Rahul in front of cameras. I know they shat the bed today but holy fuck the tough conversations can take place behind closed doors. Shah Rukh doesn't go berserk even when KKR get thrashed,23
2024-05-08 10:55:45 PM IST,"KL should not have gone on that KWK episode, since then things have gone bad for him",23
2024-05-08 10:56:57 PM IST,bsdk goenka. no wonder lsg are feeling so much pressure,16
2024-05-08 10:57:47 PM IST,What did goenka do?,7
2024-05-08 10:57:48 PM IST,"Goenka might actually turn the tide into people supporting KL, man's an absolute idiot. He was in an AC room all evening and now he comes out to yell at a player who was mostly on the ground for a while now, atleast let him rest physically ffs

Hope someone eggs his ass on the way home",36

2024-05-08 11:02:39 PM IST,So SRH vs CSK most likely eliminator with good NRR.,10

2024-05-08 11:23:45 PM IST,"Honestly hope KL gets released in the next auction and we get him. 
 
We can make him play at number 3 as a pure batsman without keeping or captaincy burden.",21
2024-05-08 11:32:09 PM IST,For fun they should have let them bat the full 20 overs just to see if they could get over 300,37
2024-05-08 11:41:23 PM IST,"KL played shit today, but man has captained India and has been a very crucial player for us in odi and test, he definietly doesn't deserved to be lashed out at in from of the caneras while the whole world is watching, on top of that man hardly opens his mouth.",25

What did I miss?",18
2024-05-09 01:35:44 AM IST,I was about to make fun about KL but I saw that video about Sanjiv Goenka publicly humiliating him. I would be standing with KL on that. That was absolutely disgraceful and unprofessional from Sanjiv Goenka. That guy has done that during the past as well. I remember about him publicly making snarky comment about Dhoni on Twitter while Dhoni was still playing for RPS. That man clearly has no decency or professionalism. If big sportsmen are facing that from him then I wonder about what the regular people that are employees in whatever company he runs have to deal with.,27
