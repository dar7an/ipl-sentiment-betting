2024-05-03 06:49:40 PM IST,Ramandeep Singh should have been bowling more. If he was in some kind of form it would’ve helped in the fast bowling all rounder search. It’s funny that KKR management derailed both of their R Singh’s in a way,6

2024-05-03 08:47:02 PM IST,50(36)* is eternal,3
2024-05-03 08:47:03 PM IST,I feel like they will be below par regardless. It seemed like a good pitch with no real demons. KKR just played stupidily in the PP. They were either too aggressive or too timid. Got themselves out both ways,4
2024-05-03 08:47:03 PM IST,No ball and monish pandy,6
2024-05-03 08:47:11 PM IST,"People were hyping up rink like how he would show aukaat(put them in their place) to bcci. Instead he got aukaated🤣. He is only good if the bowlers are bowling full tosses, dube clears him by a mile",-10

2024-05-03 08:47:20 PM IST,WTF was that!!!,3
2024-05-03 08:47:21 PM IST,Manish has done really well… but it’s time for him to go and Russell or Ramandeep to come.,4
2024-05-03 08:47:23 PM IST,Ayo thushara,2
2024-05-03 08:47:25 PM IST,Free gift Manish.. Use it.,7
2024-05-03 08:47:27 PM IST,Just because Monish came out of syllabus doesn't mean you should try to kill him.,13
2024-05-03 08:47:30 PM IST,"As far as I know Venky, he would get out quickly after making a 50",5
2024-05-03 08:47:30 PM IST,   Tf was that?,3
2024-05-03 08:47:36 PM IST,One more bowler with Malinga action.. damn,1
2024-05-03 08:47:36 PM IST,Thanks Manish but please go out now,2
2024-05-03 08:47:38 PM IST,That ball slipped from his hands,3
2024-05-03 08:47:40 PM IST,That might be the worst no ball in this ipl,5
2024-05-03 08:47:40 PM IST,They are trying kill Pandey ji because he is so dangerous,6
2024-05-03 08:47:40 PM IST,Thusara has no control,1
2024-05-03 08:47:45 PM IST,Navdeep Thusara sends his regards,2
2024-05-03 08:47:45 PM IST,why do MI always choke after getting 4/5 early wickets? just like the PBKS game. hardik should stop giving balls to coetzee. give it early to bumrah and get the fucking wickets,2
2024-05-03 08:47:47 PM IST,I'm not sure abt the best wicketkeeper in this ipl but the Kishan is definitely one of the worst,3
2024-05-03 08:47:47 PM IST,Just found something interesting. Manish pandey has played 39 t20is batted in 33 and he averages 44.31 with a strike rate of 126. Most shocking thing is pandey's average is twice that of R pant and both have the same strike rate of 126. Pant avgs 22 in 56 innings.,6

2024-05-03 08:47:52 PM IST,The fact that kkr already had a batter coming in at no 8 but also used impact player to get Manish Pandey in because of the collapse perfectly sums up why I hate it,8

2024-05-03 09:27:07 PM IST,Fast accurate Yorkers are what matter. Starc could hit 3-4 in his heyday. Now Bumrah can hit 4 around 140k. What matters is an accurate 145+ ball and some accurate slow well disguised stuff. Tye is a great example of not being relevant anymore because he can't hit 145 on his quick one and even when he hit's that pace he doesn't have accuracy. Bumrah makes you think he's around 140with accuracy or his slower ones have the batter guessing until the ball hits the pitch. Only archer and wood can do better now. Archer with his high 140s Yorkers and wood with accurate 150's that you have to play for. Bumrah has a 140 Yorker that he can nail constantly and that makes him the most dangerous bowler,3

I agree you shouldn’t strike at 110-120, but anchoring is a necessity of the game when it’s not played on roads.  

Look how beautifully Pandey anchored the game today. Yes he’s lacking in high scoring games, but this is also a talent. He has a technically solid game (Ranji captain) so he’s able to anchor with ease.   

I’m hoping for Pandya and SKY to play well today and take their form into the World Cup

He dots one, takes single on the last ball of the over. Nortje has the ball and tries to intimidate Thala with a surprising Sling action on the first bowl only to get hit for a six on the long-on. He hits sixes on the next 2 balls too. Ind needs 5 on 2 and then we suddenly hear Sting’s music only to see Rayudu come out with another *3D in the bank* contract, cashes in and enters the match replacing Kuldeep. Thala has seen a ghost and doesn’t know how to comprehend the situation. Nortje is ready to bowl a yorker but before he could bowl, Rayudu steps out reaching a quarter of the crease and screams, “*Mankad me ya fucking idiot*”. Nortje simply cannot bottle this and runs for his life towards the wicket to hit the stumps and done.

Rayudu costs Ind the match only to hijack the production room and announce on live telecast, “*Haha I was not letting Thala insult me once again, Was I?*”.",6
