I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin b0ner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary.

I just hope it's not Virat that's been driving the auction process for RCB in past 10 years and it's hard to imagine him to be doing that looking at how great he did for India. Virat should be interfering to make the team buy good bowlers first and the batting superstars later, if the team still doesn't listen then he should leave the team.",12

Comes in late 2010's in IPL as a bowler that quickly dominated domestic cricket then selected in Indian team as well but he became known as the meme bowler for IPL and India.

Then he gets to play in BGT tests (his best domestic format) because of injury to Shami after India loses 36 all out and Kohli leaves. Ends up winning the series and becomes India's highest wicket taker. 

Continues to be poor in IPL, Limited overs for India but keeps producing gems in tests in 2021 (ex Lords, Wanderers)

2022 rolls in, he starts losing form in tests but starts becoming good in IPL and Limited Overs for India. Continues this progress into 2023 till the WC.
