Still rapid but on a T20 track if all you do is bowl back of a length at that pace you will get sent.\n\nBut not necessarily at 150+. That is what makes pace so special.

Then he isn't picked for the world cup squad. India picks their regular expected squad, and makes it to the final (against Australia for example).\n\nThen a couple of pacers fake injuries, and few other bowlers who are obvious injury replacements make them unavailable due to a variety of reasons. India left with no other choice, picks up an unknown random bowler named Mayank Yadav for the match. \n\nHe bowls against Travis head in the second over. He bowls first 3 balls at 125 kph, making Head feel he's just a medium pacer. And then he bowls the 4th ball at 155 kph...onto the stumps... completely rattling Head, and eventually over the Australian batting line up as they get caught by a surprise.\n\nIndia wins the T20 world cup after 17 years.",

Back in gayle, AB, Kohli era\u2026they would win a lot of games but choke near the end of the tournament. \n\nNow it\u2019s just Kohli, a loud and passionate fan base that is depleting, and pure vibes. \n\nWhen Virat leaves they will become like that Delhi Daredevils team that finished last like 3 years In a row",
