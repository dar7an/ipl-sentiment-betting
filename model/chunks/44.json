The organizers would've made a conscious effort to give more bang for the buck to the audience, more sixes and fours during a game, so the audience can wave them flags that were sold to them more often, twice an over or something.\n\nThey want the matches to last longer purely for economic reasons. They have like 25k to 50k people at any given venue. They want them to be there longer, so they can get them to spend more at the venue(s). Low-scoring games that end early, with boring defensive cricket on display, where bowlers come out of top doesn't help sales and commerce.  This is like a big party for the audience, they want to dance every over, celebrate every boundary/six.\n\nIt's commercial entertainment. they want to pack more action in 40 over bandwidth they're working with. More runs per game was a no-brainer, to get more leverage out of the audience.\n\nIPL is a good example of how economics can influence the evolution of a given sport.\n\nSorry for the rant, folks. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat)",

It (the difference) used to be a couple of overs, now it\u2019s becoming a couple of balls. Because of the kind of games and how the bowlers are under pressure, we backed ourselves to do it. If I had to pick something out, we could have taken a couple of more chances in the middle overs. The left-handers could have probably gone after Axar a little bit, it\u2019s something we missed out in terms of game awareness. It was quite amazing the way he (Fraser-McGurk) batted, he took calculated risks, he played the field really well. It shows the fearlessness of youth. (If he would\u2019ve done something different at the toss) Not really.\n\nLeft handers he mean Tilak? Shame that\u2019s some shit to say. Didn\u2019t even appreciate his effort",

Why would they give their batters a road in the IPL and slow, sluggish, spin tracks in the WC.

Jokes aside though, this is the perfect blueprint for a clutch chase after early wickets.\n\nGreat inning from Jurel as well. Enjoyed some luck out there tonight but you need it to get a jumpstart when a little out of sorts. \n\nGood innings from KL and Deepak as well, always appreciate solid competition. \n\nOverall, a very enjoyable game, and I've wasted another night not studying \ud83d\udc80",
