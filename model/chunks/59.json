His 4s and 6s are still coming, and he keeps the scoreboard moving.\n\nThe difference is that in the power play, the field restricted his singles, and he'd get a 6, three dots and a single instead.",

Pulled straight to deep square leg where Rashid first takes the catch but his right leg is about to touch the boundary cushion and Rashid throws the ball back in just in time. Clean so far, let's move forward. Just when he catches the ball again, his right foot has come off and landed again juuuust before the cushions. There's no movement of the cushion at that moment, and Rashid's smile stays\n\nRuturaj Gaikwad c Rashid Khan b Yadav 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0",

Yuvraj Singh said in 2023 (years after he went bald due to cancer once) that Dhoni and I aren't friends. Coincidence? Think again. In 2012 Dhoni criticized Sehwag (Yes the guy who went bald and planted hair back)for being slow in the field. And now its Mitchell's turn. The only non bald player Dhoni hates is Harbhajan singh, who expressed his criticism of dhoni for throwing him out of team unreasonably after 2011 when he had 400+ wickets. And guess what, this guy wears a turban to cover his hair, so he is technically bald. The breadcrumbs are endless, this isn't just a conspiracy.\n\nI will finish my detailed investigation report and update soon.",
