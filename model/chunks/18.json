Next, Malik was also impressive in his intial spells but got a bit figured out later, the same thing could happen with Mayank does that mean Mayank is finshed? Or would it mean that he'll need a litter bit of time to figure out his game. Vinod kambli averaged 10 million in his first few test and McGrath only averaged 35 in first few test but we all know how both of their careers turned out.",

It's good that you have given license to kill to Rachin but when he does get out in the first three over, which will happen a lot, you cannot send another anchor. Specially when you have a stacked batting line-up like CSK. You gotta send another power hitter who will swing at everything. If things do need to be anchored, you have one on the crease and he can hog the strike all he wants. Two anchors is just pathetic and kills the game in the starting only. Same happened last match, and same will happen in this match.",

The game has evolved and teams/players have finally understood that the first 6 overs are for absolutely murdering the opposition bowling and not for consolidation. \n\n\n\nThere are only 2 fielders outside the circle for first 6 overs, it's the golden period to score runs, the ball is hard as well just hit it in the air well enough to clear the circle and that's what teams are doing in IPL as well. That's why we are seeing 270s being scored with ease. Why be 46/0 after 6 overs when you an be 72/1 and just destroy the opposition mentally in first 6 overs itself?This is going to be the difference between scoring 180 in 20 overs vs ending up on 230 in 20 overs.
