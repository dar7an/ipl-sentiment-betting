Virat get's to bat twice but left handed the second time.\n\n4. Sunil Narine can chuck\n\n5. If MSD walks out to bat in the last over the game is now 21 overs.\n\n6. Chest high bumpers are a no ball for Shreyas Iyer.\n\n7. SKY can only hit 120 degrees in front of the wicket\n\n8. Crowd catches count as out for Mo Siraj\n\nAnd so on",

Technically the batter left the field on their own accord so they're out without the fielding team getting them out.

          "comment": "We don't need Gaikwad, Sharma and other overrated hacks. They score 100(56), but are incapable of scoring 100(68) like Kohli. The Kohli type innings are far superior since they prove that you can survive for longer while still scoring the same amount of runs which is exactly what you want from a batter to take the shine off the ball and tire out opponent pacers. We need Kohli to play in T20 WC to break more individual records which are the only things that really matter, since we anyway gave up on ICC trophies. Rohit and Siraj make perfect sense too!",

Dube might still not be seen as bankable against the Pakistan pacers, but there's high chance that he will take down bowling attacks of Ireland, Canada, and USA.\n\nAnd apart from those sureshot Ws, it'll just be a bonus if je does go well against Pakistan & the 2nd round teams. By that time, if he has consistently fired, he will have that confidence & momentum needed to possibly tear down better attacks.\n\nI think Dube should be in that 15.",

But, I think the uncertainty about his place made him very conservative, and he has been that ever since. \n\nI love watching KL play, but I get KLPD-ed every time.

If you build a risk profile, I think letting them be in for about 20 balls is ideal. Then, get them out. It's ok, just like the stock market, you don't want to hold for too long and be stuck with bags on the way down. Take the profits of a struggling batter after 20 balls. It's 1/6 of the innings, gone. Paddikal has effectively killed the game for LSG here. 14 off 20 can become 20 off 29, yes, but it can also become 35 off 25 and then you get accused of \"bringing him into form\" and shit. This was the absolute right time to dismiss paddikal and CSK damn near nailed it in my opinion.",

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Marcus. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. \n\nSometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",
