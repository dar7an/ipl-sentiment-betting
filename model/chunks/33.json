It's too hard to sustainably bowl yorkers unless you are aided by something like a strange action (there's a reason Malinga/Bumrah low full tosses were still hard to hit). Miss your length by an inch and it's a slot ball getting smashed or a full toss that's easy to deposit.",

We don't need a third umpire to tell the ball is outside the guide line, we need them to analyse if the batter moved and make the right call. \nReviews for wides are useless if this continues.",

He bowled good, he has an economy of 7.3, he didn't waste a lot of bowls with bat too, did what the situation demanded when he knew he had players to hit. The bowling change to bring in Bumrah and Coetzee changed the game here, in these 2 overs, only 5 runs were scored with 1 important wicket of Ashutosh. Criticize where it's due, credits where it's due is good, but criticise when you do good is abysmal.",
