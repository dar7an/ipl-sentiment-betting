People had forgotten the pure brilliance of the great Lalit Modi and his vision when he had conceived a league where bowlers are taken to the cleaners and make them question their life choices. The very first match of IPL Bazball had taken birth and later Yuvi, Gayle and Dhoni took their teams to such unconquerable peaks. Suddenly people had forgotten this and were shagging to dot balls and maidens. Glad that the original vision is back today with the guy who terrorized Indian cricket team in the last two ICC events.",

The very last match of IPL child abuse had taken birth and earlier Yuvi, Gayle and Dhoni had taken their teams to such unconquerable peaks. Suddenly people had forgotten this and were shagging to dot balls and maidens.

I don't want to hear people shitting on Rohit's captaincy ever again. Under an idiot captain like Hardik, India wouldn't make it out of any group stage even.   \n\nRohit won FIVE IPLs and people said it doesn't count because MI are the best team. They just became even better, and yet look at the results. Rohit won ten games in a row in the WC. Rohit outsmarted a marauding Bazball team and destroyed them after a whole bunch of English media hype. Give the man his due recognition ffs. He's not good enough as a batter for the upcoming WC, but let's be grateful for what we have and not expect Thala every single time.\n\n/endrant",

And that's what set his flame and fueled by this, SRH made it a side quest to annihilate that record. And that's what Klassen did today, against a bowling attack that was touted to be one of the best before this season. Beware RCB, he's coming for you next.\u00a0",

We've been a bit unlucky with injuries to our overseas left-arm quicks but the spin department is still so subpar when you compare it to the other teams in the IPL. Piyush Chawla should be enjoying his retirement and we've brought him back for yet another graveyard shift.",

We have just witnessed the collective effort of four batters who have so effortlessly dismantled the record for the greatest IPL score without having anyone amongst their ranks score more than 80. This, ladies and gentlemen, will go down in history as THAT match: the one where Pandya's team crumbled under pressure almost conceding at 15rpo. This will go down in history as the match in which only Bumrah with a 'respectable' 9 rpo had an economy under 10. It will go down as a game which few would forget. Remember, Coetzee and Bumrah prevented what could've been the IPL's first three hundred plus total \u2014 and Hyderabad have just achieved a cheat code of sorts in terms of NRR. So bring on Cummins' boys \u2014 as their carnage echoes in the streets of Hyderabad. This will probably be the end of the short-lived era of Mumbai where a Hardik Pandya had armband privileges \u2014 and a revision lesson in team building for the once masterful team builders in Mumbai Indians.",

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin b0ner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",

David didn't do too badly but it was pandya who wasted a shit ton of balls and never got going.\n\nGenuinely awful awful game awareness by him.

No matter how flat pitches are, scoreboard pressure trumps it all. But to put up and show and make a game out of this, some good mental strength shown by them. What a game! what an L pitch!",
