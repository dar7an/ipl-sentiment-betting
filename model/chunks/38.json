We're seeing so many times that the bowler runs in but the batter isn't ready, the batter isn't even looking. And then the bowler has to go back. This is the responsibility of the umpire, to make the bowler know that the batter isn't ready yet, by extending one of the arms. The umpire can also ask the batter to move on with it if needed. But unless the batter is ready, the umpire has to keep their arm extended so that the bowler knows. This is one of the first things we're taught in umpiring.

If people still blame Hardik for this, it's just blind hatred.",

It doesn't seem like Hardik is able to motivate or energize his players or have the control over the dressing room that he should. It's very difficult to do when you don't have the support of the senior players. It was also evident in the way Nabi reposted a story on Instagram questioning MI management's decision to not bowl him and bat him lower in the order. In a well gelled team players won't show public dissent like this.",

He could have achieved so much more at GT and probably could have gone down as one of the legends of the cricket and would have easily ended up as a captain to ICT as well.\n\nBut he had to go back to daddy Ambani and show off his shit attitude to his teammates.
