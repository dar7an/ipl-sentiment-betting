Ashutosh Sharma tosses the coin and Rutu calls heads. And the coin lands on its side! Can you believe it! Ashutosh wins the toss! Wait a minute. Is that.......? Yes it is! Dhoni walks into the ground, just like it's 2019! He is having a heated argument with the match referee Virat Kohli. Reports say that Anushka Sharma is live streaming the incident on her Instagram, victimising Virat Kohli. Virat doesn't allow a re-toss! The eternal commentator Sunny G and 97 man Gautam Gambhir have walked to oppose Kohli. They seem to not care about CSK. Just here to bash Kohli. Ashutosh is declared the toss winner. But there's a twist! Thala denies a choice to Ashutosh Sharma! Just like he used to deny singles to his team mates! And Thala chooses Punjab will have a bowl! Everybody is worshipping thala for his masterstroke.\"",

Rahane has to go, and CSK have been rocked early!**\n\nAjinkya Rahane c Rabada b Arshdeep Singh 9 (7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 128.57",

Adds more value to his team than many current IPL players. And of course, he's still there because it benefits the franchise and pleases the fans.

          "comment": "**18.5** **and Harshal cleans up Dhoni first ball!** A superb slower yorker that drops on Dhoni late and does him all ends up. He does not pick the variation and like Shardul, is early into the stroke. The ball sneaks under the toe-end, and then thunders into the stumps. The CSK fans at the venue cannot quite believe what has happened, and their day goes from bad to worse!\n\nMS Dhoni b Patel 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0",

However, it\u2019s hard to understand how someone like Thakur can concentrate freely on their batting and the ball that\u2019s coming, when all that can be heard so loudly are chants of \u201cDHONI, DHONI!\u201d and \u201cWE WANT DHONI!\u201d. Surely that does anything but help the batter on strike, and is actually quite a negative distraction. The failure to support the batter on strike, and recognise the issue, speaks to the toxicity of CSK\u2019s fanbase, which of course was there in large numbers during the innings today. I used to love CSK, especially due to Indian legends like Dhoni and Jadeja, who have won so many games for them. But now having seen the problems with so many of their fans, I am less inclined to do so in the future. This likely won\u2019t be popular or necessary to say, but just the perspective of an unbiased Indian fan",
