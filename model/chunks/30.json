Those first few powerplay overs are so often underutilised in my opinion. 2 out, hard ball and almost exclusively quick bowlers, there's a massive opportunity to really score a lot and it's worth burning a wicket taking that on. Travis Head isn't going to come off all the time, but he's smart enough to take on the areas where there are no deep fielders and has the skill to carry the plan out. I think more teams should explore this option of at least one batter being hyper aggressive early. They do it late when the field is back and the ball is soft, why not take the risk earlier too?",

Even though I really feel he isn't made for T20s, he can still be a very good player if they build a balanced team and give Koach clear roles and duties which suits his skillset. Like even Jinks can justify his position and thrive in CSK, certainly someone with quality of Kohli can be used to win matches. But not with RCB tho, RCB have no philosophy neither any strategy or plan. They are all headless chickens relying on individual flashes of brilliance. Absolutely brain-dead management and they totally deserve it. Kohli should have left years ago, there's nothing to prove being loyal to a marketing company and not a serious cricketing team.",

He claimed that the balls in international tournaments swing, seam, and spin much better - probably because of the balls being straight from factory and not stored in a godown - and this is why bowlers like Shami are so deadly there compared to in leagues and bilaterals. This is also likely why lots of IPL performers fail in big international tournaments.\n\n\nJesus christ a new low for RCB-tards, blaming the fucking ball now",

Punjab game was the best example, he saw there was some swing and he bought himself in and got bairstow. 20 cr for this guy is way more justified compared to 24cr starc.",
