You can be a successful commentator even if you call Sandeep Sharma 'Sandeep Kumar', and misname every other player as you wish\n\n7. Don't let the iPhone goooowwooaawwhhooo\n\n8.

It\u2019s almost as if they want someone who can perfectly pace the innings, and always score big. Like Kohli has done consistently in the recent past (and before as well). But then, they also complain about Kohli. Not sure why they feel like there are a lot of hidden gems somewhere in India who can all play this perfect game every single time but somehow are not given deserving chances.",

KL had a resurgence in Tests at 30. Zaheer was a better bowler after 30.   \n\nSome GUN players are good even when young and that\u2019s what sets them apart from the others - these are the Sachins, jaiswals, gills, Rohits, Kohlis, Pants, Yuvraj, Rainas etc.",

You create a system where you reward only aggregate over SR that's what happens.\n\nKohli and Patel have improved tremendously in the 2nd half but they haven't been better than Head oe Bumrah.\n\nI much prefer we abolish those outdated cap system or use some advanced model like Cricinfo and Cricviz which take SR and pitch into account.
