It may or may not work, but they are going at everything, and having faith on the team. Add to that when they're in such a form feeding someone like lalit who then bowled like shit, that too in a powerplay lol.\n\nAppreciate the batting prowess of such talented players. Yea there are mostly flat pitches these days but this is just a team who's executing their plans very well.",

A batsman batting in Chennai and Lucknow's stats will never compete with guys batting in Wankhede and Chinnaswamy, there's just too much of a difference. You have to look at more nuanced stats which compare impact, otherwise forget about it, pure SR and avgs mean absolutely nothing now.",

He went about his business this way in the previous game too and made up for a slow start. The situation too demanded him to stitch a bit of a partnership given that DC had lost 4 wickets. \n\nBut after that, it seemed that he just couldn't put the slower bouncers away. He tried swiping at the ball and failed on a numerous occasions. Which is strange because I don't remember ever noticing that to be a standout weakness of his. However, that is basically all that Pat Cummins has dished out to him. So, I reckon that the SRH bowlers did their homework and perhaps that is one ball that Pant is not particularly strong against. It just hasn't come to fore before today. \n\nI could be wrong, but this is what makes sense to me. Also, somebody help me decode why Cummins slowie has been so hard to get away with tonigh? It's not just the slow bumpers, but whenever he has bowled slow. What makes his slowie so tough to put away?",
