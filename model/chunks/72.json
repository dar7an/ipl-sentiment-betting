He has a very good team and he is a very good batsman. \n\nToday is the day he cements to the casuals on how he should be respected and credited as a genuine India player. And how he should be in the conversation and should be a regular in the Indian side. \n\nHe has to take this on and make sure he takes his side home. Otherwise this is again a forgetful season for RR no matter how good and balanced they are. And a forgetful season for him no matter how talented and complete as a batter he seems. \n\nThe greats make their names on days like these. Too many of us Sanju believers feel he is hard done when it comes to team India selection and his overall appreciation. But if you don\u2019t pull through on big days like these, you won\u2019t ever get it. You have to force and kill your way through and win these situations if you want to level up. \n\nSanju\u2019s career is at an inflection point. He has been around for a while. He has been considered a talent for a while. He has been snubbed for a while. Now he is at the age, that if he doesn\u2019t perform and produce on the day off, it is over.",

And they're excellent players, so they'll compensate elsewhere. \n\nAll they needed was Kohli to go \"fuck it, I'll be aggressive\" now their team is great",

Any right arm finger spinner is going to get hammered in T20, that's why they're a dying breed. \n\nBut on a pitch with something for the bowlers, Ash is more than a handful, even though he's not the white ball bowler he once was. He's become more of a really good defensive bowler who likes attacking the big wickets in the opposition when there's a bit of help in the surface",

          "comment": "Yes and it caused such a massive buildup of calcium in his bones that throughout most of his career there was a weak affinity between his bones and trace amounts of calcium carbonate in the stumps. So he was able to electromagnetically 'anchor' himself to the stumps while batting and play those helicopter shots that should be impossible for mere mortals. This also explains his insane speed behind the stumps. He is already attracted to them in the first place, so he is able to execute stumpings at unbelievable speeds.\n\nOver the last decade his body has slowly metabolised the calcium deposits he was able to accumulate while drinking six litres of milk per day and now his calcium levels are returning to normal. That is why he's unable to hit as far as he used to, and if he keeps playing we will see him get slower behind the stumps.\n\nThis is all because of inflation. The government could have subsidised milk for Dhoni, but they did not. Blame the government. Dhoni could have been a God among men, but now that will never come to pass.",

The fact that someone can be incompetent for so long and make tons of money is unfortunate, there are many talented players who could've played in the past decade in his place.",

Shami and Bhuvi survived on their elite longer-format skills which is what kept them relevant for cups but also highly disposable when it was clear their time was over\n\nSiraj at his best in T20s will not be fit to polish the boots of the likes of Starc, Shaheen, Hazlewood, Bumrah playing with active niggles at bowling in the late 130s\n\nSo fucking tired of watching the guy for the last 7 years bowl like a clueless moron with his lengths in T20s. He lacks any natural affinity for this format; everyone knows they can go after him regardless of length once he is hit for two boundaries, even if he gives 120% of his all for the next 20 balls of his quota\n\nComfortably loosened the game. Instead of investing in an inconsistent core clown in Maxwell and the ilk, thus having neither batting nor bowling, release clowns like Siraj aim to actually develop your bowling core, RCB. Dayal and Siraj are C+ tier T20 bowlers. Will you ever learn RCB? IPL has always lacked enough quality bowlers especially after expansion to 10 teams; shoud have poached them when you could have at the mega auction",

Of course CSK, MI, KKR, SRH have done it in big games. They've defended low totals. MI ffs even defended 130 in a final lol. KKR won 9 from 9. CSK, well, the most recent example is last year. \n\nRCB has to keep believing, that's literally the way to win a tournament. Can't just expect everything to fall into place.",

I hope they don't win anything till there's life on God's Green Earth. They come back with their stupid and quite frankly over the top arrogance every single year and spoil the mood of every one. I can see a RCB fan cry for 24 Hours straight and feel no remorse whatsoever. They aren't any better in real life as well. Their subreddit is the ultimate cancer on reddit and needs to be deleted asap. That shithole is worse than anything present on this platform. Their constant yapping on Twitter and Instagram and their constant death threats to players of other teams and their own team as well is well known around the community. Dear God make them suffer in the worst way that is known to you and bring sanity and peace to our world.",

If people fall for Parag's sex appeal and Jurel's effortless masculinity, it is Anna's enlightenment, tranquility, and relentless spirituality that attracts us Test match purists.

The match was going in Kaurava's favour but everything changed when a Challenger from Bangalore came into bowling for the Kauravas.The Challenger from Bangalore started choking.\n\nPanadavas was surprised and happy, it helped them so much that they vowed to add the Challenger from Bangalore into their Royal family, so they gave him their own very special and unique name - ROYAL CHALLENGER. Now, after 5000 years of that legendary match, Royal Challengers are regarded as the a GODS of choking by Hindus throughout the world.\n\nAs a religious man, I would like to end my legendary tale on the The Challenger of Bangalore and thank all cricket fans for this beautiful opportunity, Long Live The Royal Challenger",

On the other hand, I quite like RR too and it would've been pretty sad if they were kicked out of the eliminator after dominating the first half like they did, so I wouldn't mind if they win either. But if RR won, RCB will be kicked out, which means CSK will get even more reasons to troll RCB, which is quite sad too. So I don't know which team I want to see win.",

I hope they don't win anything till there's life on God's Green Earth. They come back with their stupid and quite frankly over the top arrogance every single year and spoil the mood of every one. I can see a RCB fan cry for 24 Hours straight and feel no remorse whatsoever. They aren't any better in real life as well. Their subreddit is the ultimate cancer on reddit and needs to be deleted asap. That shithole is worse than anything present on this platform. Their constant yapping on Twitter and Instagram and their constant death threats to players of other teams and their own team as well is well known around the community. Dear God make them suffer in the worst way that is known to you and bring sanity and peace to our world.",
