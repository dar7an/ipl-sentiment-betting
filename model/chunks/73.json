With dew in the second inning and their spin attack not being that great, they need to give their bowlers a cushion of extra runs to defend. They also need to try something new when they come to bowl. If they put up a big total, the pressure will be on RR, as they will have to attack throughout the entire inning, creating chances for wickets. RR doesn't have a deep batting lineup after Ashwin, and the batting form of a few RR players isn't that great, although they are capable enough to pull it off. Therefore, SRH should focus on putting up a big total.",

In batting, all the wickets have been aggressive shots in an over that already had runs, except head but that was still an aggressive shot to a slower short ball, a common delivery from sandy. In bowling, not picking a spinner in the first 11 and having a second one on the bench. They have markande on the bench but should've had a spinner like shahbaz in the batting 11. Can't get away with head, markram or samad to put 4 overs down.",

I'll believe in them a lot more if this chase is much more controlled than their last.\n\nEither way, in order of preference for me, SRH > KKR > RR. Most likely result, KKR > RR > SRH atm.",

NKR was the most disappointing imo, focusing on getting that switch shot right instead of sticking to the role he needed to play today, that sorta stubbornness never works out, just let it go after you fail thrice bro. Kinda braindead too cus the whole point of a switch shot is to hit it on the side there aren't many fielders, there literally were three of em there. He talks sm about wanting to get SRH out of sticky situations and how that's his role and yet that's what he chose to do in a high stakes game like this.\n\nDunno what we'd have done without that start and Klaasen. Just glad there doesn't seem to be some dew and that it feels like it's gotten tougher to bat on.",

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to CUMMINS. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to CUMMINS. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",
