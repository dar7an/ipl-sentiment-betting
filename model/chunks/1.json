They have the best squad of all time and have reached the finals without a single loss in the league stage. The final is taking place in M Chinnaswamy stadium, Bangalore,  which is now equipped with anti-gravity seating and AI-controlled cheerleaders.\n\nMeanwhile, CSK ended 4th in the leagues stage but win the knockout games and reach the final. It's RCB vs CSK in final. The legendary rivals meet once again. Thala is still the captain. Rohit and SKY have come to watch the final along with their grandkids. Chinnaswamy is filled with colours of red and yellow. Kohli's grandson and Thala arrive at the toss. Kohli's grandson wins the toss and decides to bat first.\n\nRCB score 300/2 in 20 overs with the grandson scoring a double century with shots that defy the laws of physics. CSK in reply keep chipping but lose wickets on regular intervals. Thala avoids coming to the crease and keeps on sending batsman after batsman.\n\nIt's 20th over. CSK need 100 runs in last over with Thala finally coming in at No. 11. He has already lost a limb but is still playing for CSK. RCB fans have started celebrating, as they are finally winning a trophy. But CSK fans celebrate even more as Thala has come to the crease.\n\nKohli's grandson, trying to capitalize on the family cricketing legacy, hands over the ball to Harshal Patel's grandson to bowl the last over. Harshal Patel's grandson succumbs to the pressure and bowls 65 wides and no-balls in the final over while Thala effortlessly hits 6 sixes in 6 balls. CSK win their 25th trophy. The stadium is filled with yellow cums of csk fans. Meanwhile RCB bottle again in the final. During the post match conference, Thala says he will play again in the next season. Thala for another season.",

The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth grip on the bat, and that gorgeous wicketkeeping stance. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire.\nYou had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the pitch, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face.\nYou have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when CSK got suspended and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first IPL trophy once CSK was reinstated, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then alas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2016 and 2017 were hard years for us baby, but in 2018 you made history happen. You came back home and I couldn't believe it. 5 championships and 10 finals. Here's to 6 and 11 <3\nIn 2020, I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, \"DEFINITELY NOT!\" Not only have you changed the game of cricket and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious THALA, MS DHONI.",

The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth grip on the bat, and that gorgeous wicketkeeping stance. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire.\nYou had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the pitch, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face.\nYou have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when CSK got suspended and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first IPL trophy once CSK was reinstated, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then alas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2016 and 2017 were hard years for us baby, but in 2018 you made history happen. You came back home and I couldn't believe it. 5 championships and 10 finals. Here's to 6 and 11 <3\nIn 2020, I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, \"DEFINITELY NOT!\" Not only have you changed the game of cricket and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious THALA, MS DHONI.",
