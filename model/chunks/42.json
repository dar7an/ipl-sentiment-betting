Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Fuck the sponsors, we have ads, electronic boards, strategic timeouts, etc. for that shit.\n\n\nPushing out boundaries will also bring more outfielders into the game.\n\n\n2) Name your impact sub before the game. All rounders will be back in contention. Better, get rid of it completely.\u00a0\n\n\n3) Remove the toss. Let the away team choose to bat or bowl. Controversial, I agree. But home team will have an excuse to 'doctor' pitches which will suit their team.\n\n\n4) Bonus points if a team reaches a target within specified number of overs or a team wins by certain amount of runs.

The parathas are high in calories as they have a lot of butter in them. But this can cause Paratha phenomenon. It is a rare human condition where you start secreting butter from your fingers. This is the reason why Punjab bowlers cant bowl or fielders can't field. Incidentally RCB players also had this issue because of their heavy intake of butter Dosa.",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Unlike heartless cricketers like Hardik Pandya, who demand to get promoted up the order to showcase their skills, he prefers to give the opposition a chance, letting them face Markram and Pooran instead. He even gifts runs by bowling to level the playing field, putting selfish players like Rohit and Kohli to shame for giving up bowling themselves.\n\nAll credit to Shashank. 100% win rate for a reason.",

Even considering SRH's 3 innings and KKR's 2 innings, that was just effortless and kinda TOO consistent. There wasn't a moment they were behind. All of that with only 2 wickets down and still 1+ overs has to make this the finest IPL innings of all time. Pure class.",
