It's management is utter shite. \n\nVisited for the semi, dear god, the seats are uncomfortable and often dirty. They sell seats with blocked views with no prior notification. The volume of stuff you can't bring in is atrocious but more than that the behaviour of the staff - geez. They make you walk a country mile before you can enter, the food stalls hardly leave you any space to walk, the toilets are not worth entering, I can go on and on and on...\n\nKolkata is a beautiful city. Bengalis are warm and hospitable. They love their cricket. They live this game. They'd know more about Aussie players than half our population. \n\nThey deserve better than what Bengal Cricket does for them and what BCCI does for them. Eden Gardens is iconic yes, but an absolute mess, sorry.",

And the acceleration doesn't happen.\n\nIt's what turned out in the WC'23 final. Kohli and Rahul stabilised and took their merry time. The minute Kohli reached 50, he was going to 2nd gear and beyond in all games - and in the final, Cummins got himself on the over after Kohli got 50.\n\nHe got Kohli in that over, and India struggled to make it to 250, atleast 70 behind what they needed.",

KL Rahul imo has actually changed his intent last couple of matches, and will not have a low SR in the powerplay from this point on, but he needs help in taking on the spinners in the middle overs and he isn't getting any.This is tanking the team. QDK bats like he doesn't give a shit. Pooran is amazing obviously, but he's one guy. The bowling is decent but far too inexperienced. If they qualify it will be a miracle. I feel for Rahul because he always cops a lot of shit but the truth is that both in LSG and PBKS it often seems like he's the only one who gives a shit. They need some experience in their side, badly.",
