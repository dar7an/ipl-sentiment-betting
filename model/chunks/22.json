          "comment": "KKR has an extremely shitty record against CSK which gets overshadowed by their ungodly record against MI. CSK, despite losing having 2 points less having played a game more are no doubt favorites at their home ground. Their loss to DC was bad but losing to a spirited SRH team can be excused. KKR mauled DC and beat RCB comprehensively but they're the two worst teams of this season. Their other win was against SRH and that was a good game overall which showed both side's strengths and weaknesses. Only if they win today should KKR be considered as one of the top dogs for the play-offs, and only then should CSK fans think their team is in trouble. If not, then CSK will continue on to be favorites for the play-offs as always and KKR will try to prevent a slide that haunts them at the middle of every season.",

It's probably Ruturaj's decision to do that but Dhoni needs to take control here and ask him to change that. If not , then they are just looking at another loss today , and maybe even more . Spin from overs 6-14 , that's what CSK need irrespective of the venue, it will win them more games , coz Spin with Dhoni behind the wickets and Jadeja/Theekshana bowling is a different game altogether. No other team has that kind of dominance , KKR come a close second with Narine and Chakravarty/Suyash , but not as good as CSK.",

          "comment": "That six by Raghuvanshi is such a great example of how younger Indian batters and overseas power hitters are so much more effective at dominating spinners in T20 cricket than established Indian batters.\n\nVery rarely would Kohli swing through the line that far away from the pitch of the ball. Because his whole career has been playing serious cricket on pitches that spin where swinging at a ball like that probably means giving your wicket away.\n\nBut it loses him and a few others so many runs on flat T20 wickets because he would just nudge that for one.\n\nAdd that Narine six as another example.",

Doesn\u2019t feel like cricket anymore.\n\nWe are getting some glimpses of beautiful bowling here and there but most overs there are so many wides and no balls it\u2019s annoying! \n\nRemember how strong our bowling unit was in wc? Bumrah shami siraj\u2026batsmen literally peed in their pants to face them. Hopefully someday we will get a proper face off.

          "comment": "Finally I see. Vijay Mallya's enmity and Andy Flower's rivalry with Dhoni led to them undertaking the most insidious project in world cricket. The signs were all there, but I finally understand their meaning. Wicketkeeper-GOAT Anuj Rawat playing slow. Name accurately representing the performance of the franchise. Three part name with 'C' in it. Spin choke in the middle (but it's the RCB spinners who are choking themselves). Left arm spinner-allrounder who is the second most important lookalike in the side. Both 'R' and 'S' representing letters that are very close to each other. Failing to win the title in their first two years. RCB is the Shadow to CSK's Sonic, the Cell to their Goku, the Duryodhana to their Yudhishthira, the Mordred to their Arthur. The culmination of years of envy and hate, born to tear down CSK and Dhoni's legacy, to usurp everything they stood for.",

The SRH game they literally defended 7 runs in 5 balls against Klaasen, the chance of that happening is like 1 in a million.\n\nRR on the other hand, find a new hero every match. Their biggest strength on paper is their opening partnership but until last game Buttler literally made negative runs yet they still won all 3 games they played prior. Jaiswal still hasn't got going. RR can literally only become better which is scary.  Imagine KKR if Russell and Narine were out of form they would probably be a mid table team yet that's the situation RR are in",

Not like their other skill compensates, or is even expected to compensate, for lack of delivering in the primary skill. We have completely lost the sense of magnitude on money. If a pure batter is bought for anything over 10-12 crores, that guy has to deliver a 550+ run season at 160 SR every season. Pure bowler for 17-18+ CR is unreasonable because there is nothing they can do to justify that return, maybe Bumrah is delivering on that kind of money. A specialist is just not worth it.",
