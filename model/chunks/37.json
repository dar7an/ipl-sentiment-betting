Useless fellows!\n\nI work with builders, and all they care about is the rate. Also buying cement in bulk is a hassle, you can't just walk into a shop and buy large quantities of cement just like that. \n\nAlso, literally every single cement brand in their advt will claim themselves to be the No. 1 cement of India. Is there no authority who cross checks these advts?\n\nUgh, why am i so mad at cement?!",

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Ashutosh. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",

No, because then, the anchors at the top would probably cruise along nicely for the Titans to end up at 180-odd, which will then be easily chased down.\n\nAnchors in a batting order therefore, should be few, and heavily relied upon only when the team is already in trouble, or when chasing low scores on tough pitches. This might seem 'cheap', but to win in modern T20 cricket, this is probably the best way.",

Fuck Nadal's defense, Djokovic's backhand, Federer volleys etc. We only want to see aces bro. T20 batting is only testing one facet of batting. Hitting. Fuck defensive technique, strike rotation, game management, risk assessment, running between the wickets etc. A guy like Kohli is just an ordinary IPL player now because he's only being tested in one facet of the game: hitting. He's trained all his life to be a top all round player, as do most guys like Gill, Rahul etc, players who people call anchors. Soon they won't be able to compete with guys like Fraser McGurk who have optimised their technique for only one thing all their lives. That's why pitches like these are refreshing.",
