There is a buzz in the air. 20 seconds to go. Shastri is pouring out the last of the champagne...into other people's glasses. 10 seconds to go. Kohli finally stops dancing - this is important. 3 seconds to go. 2 seconds to go. 1 second to go.\n\nMidnight comes and goes. The cheers turn to questions. Ritika's anxiousness gives way to concern. Where is Rohit?\n\nRohit has already left. Rohit gets out before 50.",

His average score would be 25\u2019ish (quite good acc to his previous performances in T20is) but thats about it. He\u2019ll score a rocking 70+ in a match against SA or ENG and a matured 50+ in a match against PAK or SL. There\u2019s no point keeping high hopes and then getting underwhelmed. He def looks in good form and may deliver as well, but the other 6 batsmen would have to play a T20 like a T20 and not *roam in USA\u2019s slow gardens*. \n\nIt\u2019ll be really great if he exceeds our expectations and delivers more than my predicted 25 average. I\u2019d love to be proven wrong by Rohit in this.",

It's time we accept that this is what we get with Pandya. If the pitch has some juice in it, then probably a lesser SR or shorter innings. \n\nInternational bowlers have obviously figured him with the back of length and spin strategy, also apt field placements. \n\nWe're going to have to depend on Rinku and SKY to bail us out in the world cup. Pandya is more of a bowling all rounder in this format.",

He wanted a top spot in a different team. Can\u2019t blame any player for that. Goes on to win a trophy as captain, good batting performance, and enters the final again next year. It\u2019s true that Nehra/Gill played a big role there, but still. Now in 2024, MI is looking to transition from Rohit because of age. Their options are: SKY, Bumrah, Kishan. None of them have a captaincy record. Or they can approach Hardik, a proven IPL captain, ex-MI player, and the likely future ICT t20 captain. Remember, Hardik also isn\u2019t an outsider to MI. He grew up here, helped us win 4 trophies. He has pedigree with MI. As much a claim to captaincy as Boom/SKY. The only party to blame in the whole fiasco is our management. That\u2019s literally it.",

I don't think seats would go empty if they were like 100 rupees for those upper stands which are a lot of times empty in huge stadiums like Gujarat. People from a certain segment of the society do not need a perfect view of the pitch but the whole experience of it all. This will have multiple advantages:\n\n1. Develop a stadium culture in the city \n2. More sales for the vendors inside the stadium \n3. Real fans can attend the stadium at a minimum cost\n\n(This is not an alien concept.

Mumbai Indians won the powerplay convincingly thanks to some sublime hitting from Rohit Sharma, who showed us that it is a typical Wankhede wicket where you can trust the bounce and hit through the line. \n\nHowever, DC seemed to figure out that there was a patch on that surface where the ball was holding up a tad. They used the off-pace balls well and pulled things back in the middle over. From over number 7 to 15, only 63 runs were scored as MI's middle order seem to loose their way with 4 wickets going down. Axar Patel was the pivot for DC in this phase. \n\nHowever, then we entered the final lap and MI hit turbo mode. Last 5 overs saw 96 runs being scored. David and Shepherd demolishes the DC quicks who were all over the place. Too many wides as well as yorkers going wrong and being converted to full tosses and sixes, eventually. \n\nThis is going to be a tall order for DC batters. Though, the good thing is that the pitch seems to be a batter's friend.",

But on a flat pitch with just one strike bowler in Bumrah DC still had a chance. Striking at 132 and taking up 31 balls doesn\u2019t make any sense when you are chasing 234. Similarly, Pandya nearly lost MI the match. You can\u2019t expect the last two overs to go for 51. If it had even got for 30 MI would have lost the match. He was striking at 118 when you have hitters like David, Shepherd in the dugout.",

And if we are relying on Kuldeep and Mukesh to control run flow, its says quite a bit about our bowling unit.\n\nBatting order could have been played around with. Come up when you're chasing 235 Captain. FFS. Porel is a young lad. Take some responsibility with the bat and come up captain, especially when you're in form. \n\nWe're stuck with all has beens and others who are still recovering. Its so frustrating to watch at this point. \n\nFeel sad for Stubbs. He is stuck with them. \nEvery win will need some sort of miracle. Please dilute the franchise. Its been long enough",
