He\u2019s won a World Cup for his country, won two IPL titles taking a dogshit team to glory, left behind a wonderful legacy for that franchise to revel in\u2026yet he wants to beat the team that hasn\u2019t won. His head to head against MI is the worst head to head record in the league against any team ever, but he can\u2019t be bothered about that. I\u2019m sure even rational kkr fans would want the focus to be on a title - but no, his ambition is only to beat the team he thinks is tinpot because our fans admire the team like nothing else. Clearly, despite his own success he doesn\u2019t think it elevates the franchise. He doesn\u2019t want higher heights, because that\u2019s the real difficult thing to do. He just wants others to think he\u2019s great, and even with the love his own fans give him, he can\u2019t see it. If I was a KKR fan, I\u2019d expect better, certainly from someone in a coaching capacity \n\nKKR doesn\u2019t have the numbers or the unconditional support that we do, and he doesn\u2019t like that. He doesn\u2019t like that Kohli has fans. He doesn\u2019t like that Dhoni has fans. He wants it all, but can\u2019t realize that success alone can\u2019t buy you loyalty and fame. He can\u2019t even fathom that people still support Rcb despite our losses.\n\nWhat a bitter, bitter man. I truly pity him.",

The players have made a circle with DJ playing Animal's \"aaj ya mai rahunga, ya saamne wala mera\" song in the stadium. The security is using tear gas on fans who were already crying seeing RCB's score. Things are going out of hand. OMG Shah Rukh Khan has entered the ground. What is happening here? Are we going to witness something similar to Wankhede? No. He is trying to calm things down. Oh wait, Vijay Mallya, is that the ex-RCB owner? WOWWW! Unreal things are happening. Vijay Mallya is lading from a chopper. He is back! Mallya is back to India but even before he could put a step on the field, they have put handcuffs on both his feet. Meanwhile Gambhir and Virat have torn each other's sleeves and throwing punches after punches which hasn't connected even once like it's Suryakumar Yadav batting in World Cup 2023 final. This madness is showing no sign to stop. Fans have flooded the ground. Some are trying to pull out the stumps while some are abusing Murali Karthik in the stump mic for calling Yash Dayal trash, RCB fans are brutal. Everyone is fighting their own battle. Oh wait, the government wasn't sending any extra forces to calm things down, but just when someone poured some water on the ground, Bangalore police is entering the ground with tanks. Unreal message. Jal hi jeevan hain guys. Peace out. Save water.\"",

Because they didn't score enough? Maxwell did his bit. He couldn't go on because he was forced to keep slogging, even against good balls. Why? Because Kohli refused to score at more than run-a-ball in the middle overs. Same for Patidar. Come in, forced to slog because Kohli can't score boundaries, get out slogging, fans blame you and hate you and praise Kohli anyway. What a scam. No wonder Indian players all turn into anchors. The fans don't value anything but runs, even at the expense of strike rate, which matters a hell of a lot in T20s.",

They bowled really well, especially in the middle overs.\n\nEveryone knows Kohli isn't a T20 player in the mould of ABD or Gayle. Going at 170+ SR game after game isn't his style. This isn't exactly a secret, so what exactly are the RCB fans complaining about? \n\nHe wasn't able to accelerate today at the same level he usually does (or used to do), but that happens from time to time. Again, good bowling by KKR.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that the RCB management is dogshit, maybe don't blame Kohli for everything? \n\nThe man's done more than enough for every team he's played in. He's not perfect, sure, but perfection is the enemy of progress. Let him breathe, for God's sake. The management and team selection needs to change WAY before Kohli's batting style does.",

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d I was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201cNot Kohli. Not Kohli.\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen bottles of steroids in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the steroid bottles and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bottle and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.\n\nEdit: it's copypasta people",

          "comment": "I will keep on supporting RCB but without any hope, without any thought of them winning anything.\n\nThis is just just pure fuckery on a multiversal level, if they'll pick someone good they'll pick alike players so they can't be played together in a game, if they by any chance pick someone good they'll throw him out in next season and won't pick him up again in auction unless he is used up and past his prime. And the foremost priority for them is to pick such useless bowlers who don't even know how to bowl a different length in 7 different matches. \n\nI don't trust this team, actually I do trust them but that trust comes with a fact that they will ultimately fuck up..\n\nI will support RCB...",

And this is not a jibe at Koach, in fact he plays at a strike rate of 138.2, his strike rate for RCB is 130.2.  He scores quicker and more for India. This RCB team is confused to the nth level. I feel for Virat, he probably won't win the IPL as the team management/owners have no clue how to make a team.",
