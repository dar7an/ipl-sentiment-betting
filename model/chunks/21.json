Why? After all selection should be based on form, and he is a shitty finisher and bolwer, and thats going to be his role in T20WC. What a joke.\n\nTell me one good all rounder this whole IPL for India, you can not.\n\nIndia is not going to lose wc because anchors, or old guards or because lack of Intent, they gonna lose becuase we have got JADEJA, AXAR AND PAndya as our finishers, i dunno man, if i was an opner, i damn sure woukd be scared to show intent when your batting ends after 4 down\n\nThank you Impact rule, limited overs ALL rounders are dead in India,just  like honest politicians in this country.",

Yesterday it was Virat Kohli who was being called a \"liability\" and today it's KL  \"breaking momentum eating balls\". So many reactionary comments makes me wonder if some people here all are watching cricket for the first time and expects every ball to go for a boundary. It's not about a particular player it's just annoying to watch some people shitting on players for fun.

It's a fair amount of muscle memory and practice, fitness, age etc etc \n\nSaw it with Yuvraj; those who've seen his peak hitting ability and then him in the mid 2010's will know. He used to 'touch' sixes, and then lost his hitting form. Sachin's ability to whack it also reduced over his career. It's physically not possible to keep being that fluent. \n\nI think that's happening with Pandya after all his injuries and probably with KL. You want everyone to keep being peak level but it's not possible. Sad but true. Even Rinku and SKY won't be the same in a few years, so please, let's play those who are in their peak zone right now.",

They were such  inseparable duo but SRH and LSG had to break them up. But time and time again, they have shown that they just arent cut out for T20 these days.  I just want to be noticed as a Mayank and KL fan and feel like they\u2019re appreciated.  People who are way less fun to watch have bigger fans and yet these guys get hated on more and more. Life is unfair.  I just want to show KL and Mayank that they can still be good.  maybe, just maybe, there's still someone out there to help them regain their form that they haven't found.  Maybe we cricket fans are too impatient, and I haven't stopped to think if we should replace them with the next generation batters\u2026But...what if there isn't that person and i'm destined to blindly follow the likes of Abhishek Sharma and Riyan Parag?  That path, to me right now, seems like the more plausible one and that's why i'm sad.\ufeff",

          "comment": "This sub needs to realise that power hitting has evolved, the only teams who actually do well have the batting line-ups who regularly score in excess of 180.\n\nThe comparison with T20 World Cups is also a logical fallacy because\n\n1) The pitches in T20 wcs are actually much more bowling friendly, at least in the last World Cup\n\n2) In 2016 and 2021 when the pitches were actually good the only teams that did well were crazy good at power hitting\n\n3) Boundary Sizes as compared to IPLs are much larger, although that's only an observation for 2022 WC\n\n4) Obviously better bowling Line-ups\n\nIn conclusion, I think that the World cup in Australia back in 2022 really spoiled a lot of people to think that 160 is the mean of t20 cricket\n\nWhich also actually had many batting Paradises tbf\n\n1) Aus vs Nz group game\n2) Ind vs Eng Semi final\n3) Ban vs sa group game\n4) Sa vs Pak group game\n and a few more to name\nWe regularly see top teams cross 180 and excess in bilaterals amongst each other",

The old KL would definitely have eaten this fire ball. I think the problem at the time is that people were frustrated that friendly KL was doing tuk tuk!

We won't ever score boundaries, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand at the non-striker's end watching him tighten his ass as he solidly defends, helmetless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run when he calls and take guard, the entire time forcing myself to think of sixes while my thoughts drift back to dot balls. I won't be able to score and I'll eventually go back to being off strike, angry. Sometimes we will look across the wicket and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will be out, and the other will lead him outside the infield. Then he'll go back on strike, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and block six balls in a row, never able to deal with an innings without his one true platonic love.",

Use him when he is on top form.\n\nSorry no Rohit, Rahul, Pant please.. or even Tilak, Jitesh etc.. sad for Ruturaj though, he doesn't fit in.\n\nThe whole point is that we need players who can strike atleast > 140. Some ofcourse 220 like Dube. WI and USA would have mostly dry surfaces.. hence good players of spin.",

The signs were all there, but I finally understand their meaning. Keeper-Captain KL Rahul playing slow. Franchise named after capital city. Three part name with 'Super' in the middle. Home ground with both slow as shit pitches and good batting ones. Spin choke in the middle. Left arm spinner-allrounder who is the second most important Indian player in the side. Rivalry with RCB. Both 'G' and 'K' representing sounds that are very close to each other. Failing to win the title in their first two years. LSG is the Shadow to CSK's Sonic, the  Cell to their Goku, the Duryodhana to their Yudhishthira, the Mordred to their Arthur. The culmination of years of envy and hate, born to tear down CSK and Dhoni's legacy, to usurp everything they stood for.",

Shahrukh Khan \n7. Tewatia \n8. Wade \n9. Rashid \n10. Noor\n11. Umesh\n12. Mohit\n\nSai and Gill are a good opening pair as they showed today\n\nVijay Shankar's best position is at No:3 and unless they play him there they might as well drop him\n\nOmarzai can easily bowl 4 overs and be a pinch hitter in middle order \n\nThe explosiveness of Abhinav, Shahrukh, Tewatia, Wade and Rashid is what they desperately need after solid platform laid by top order \n\nIn terms of bowling, they have 5 proper options in Omarzai, Noor, Rashid, Umesh and Mohit and decent 6th bowler options in Tewatia, Vijay Shankar, and  Shahrukh Khan to try in middle overs",
