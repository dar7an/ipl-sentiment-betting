Just because he failed in the final and India lost, he's not as hyped. People only remember him for being bad at facing the short ball or always being injured.",

Will the designated #11 batter walk out or does the innings end there. \n\nExample: DC replaced Ricky Bhui with Abhi Porel in the same innings. Now should DC have lost 10 wickets (ideally the innings would end) but then the designated #11 of DC who's still remaining wouldn't get to bat. What happens at this stage?

I can only wish to see them bat together again. They fed off each other's energy and complimented so well\n\nBut sadly LSG took KL and SRH took Mayank and the couple got broken up.....and they dont even play for India together",
