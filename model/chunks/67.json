          "comment": "> 7.25pm If you're wondering what Arjun Tendulkar has been up to in recent months, here's a little summary: 11 wickets in seven games in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, but his economy rate of 10.69 was the worst of all of Goa's regular bowlers; then 10 wickets at 30.20 and an economy rate of 5.49 in the 50-overs Vijay Hazare Trophy, and nine wickets in six Ranji Trophy games at an average of 44.66. He hasn't played any competitive cricket since February.\n\nBruh cricinfo clapping him\ud83d\ude2d",

And his Domestic T20 strike rate is 14.8 ^(which is better than Mukesh Kumar, Arshdeep, Avesh, Harshal Patel, Chetan Sakariya, T Natarajan, Khaleel, N Saini, D Chahar, all whom have debuted for India)\n\nYes, his stats are on a small sample size, but ffs, they're completely fine, and _technically_ better than every fast bowler who's debuted for India in the last 5 years at least. I'm not saying he's at the level of Natarajan, Arshdeep or any of them.\n\nBut chill the fuck out with the nepotism claims. What you're saying is basically **\"He doesn't deserve to play because his father is a legend, unlike other player\".** And you guys wonder why a few players take mental health breaks.",

That struck him right in front of middle stump, low as well, but let's see if it's swinging too much because he reviewed the on-field decision after the umpire raised the finger. No edge, so we wait for ball-tracking. Pitching on middle, hitting in line, crashing into leg, review gone for LSG in three balls\n\nDevdutt Padikkal lbw b Thushara 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0",

There's only a couple of bats on the team with the potential to go huge, and only 1 with any consistency. \n\nRahul doesn't attack the power play well, but he does milk the middle overs and rotate well, accelerating if he lasts long enough. Usually he plays a run a ball until 'fixing it' to a 130-150 later on, this would actually be okay if you've got a pooran at the other side all the time. If you were building a team and HAD to have Rahul, aggressive openers and Rahul coming in when there's a collapse or just outside the power play would probably be the best use of him.",

          "comment": "LSG really needs to fix their top order. De Kock, Hooda, DDP are just not firing and haven't throughout the season (except that one inning from Hooda I guess). Stoinis has also been inconsistent but he's a matchwinner when he clicks. Even if KL isn't released, they need to build a better top order around KL and Stoinis. They'd likely want to push Badoni at 4 and back him there, which means Stoinis plays at 3. If KL is going to accumulate in the powerplay, they need someone that hits hard and from ball 1 to support him and not QdK with whatever he has been doing. Nicky P at 5 and Krunal at 7 are fine.",
