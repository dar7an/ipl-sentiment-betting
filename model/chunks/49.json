There's a reason most spin bashers are from SENA where the ball doesn't spin, and you can hit through the line against spin. When the ball spins even a little bit you  need to have exceptional footwork to score runs which spin bashers don't have. Never confuse spin bashers with good players of spin.",

Thakur\n10. Chahar \n11. Gleeson/Pathirana \n\nImpact player - Despande/Mukesh\n\nMitchell needs time to settle and then explode and him as an opener could be an ideal use of him \n\nRachin/Moeen have to play at number 3 ( based on availability) and they can play pinch hitter role \n\nDube will come back strong, Rahane should be given free license to go hard in order counterattack in middle order rather than use him as an opener \n\nJadeja, Dhoni can do the finishing with batting depth from Santner, Thakur and Chahar \n\nPathirana will play if not then Gleeson\n\nDespande will play if not Mukesh",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for CSK this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of CSK on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium pace 100.\n\nI don't think CSK will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

RR had a tough start but thanks to Ashwin, the true chennai boy, they managed to score 169 and CSK had to make 170. They cruised in the powerplay but soon choked against RR spin duo, especially chahal. They are now 6 down and Dhoni is on strike with Mitchell on the other end. Sandeep is bowling the last over and CSK need 7 runs to win. They just manage to rotate strike and take singles to Sandeep's excellently bowled wide line yorkers from round the wicket. Now it's 2 required off 1 and Dhoni is on strike. He nudges the ball bowled on wide line and takes off. Chahal at third man collects the ball and throws it as quick as possible. Dhoni is coming quickly to Samson's end and throw is about to reach but Dhoni just doesn't dive and misses by an inch. Chepauk is silent. Not a single whistle blowing in the entire stadium. But to everyone's surprise, Dhoni just keeps running. In fact, he runs straight into the dugout  with his helmet still on, face not really visible. He disappears in the darkness of dugout and is never seen in the public again.",
