Even in the beginning of IPL he was struggling terribly. Everyone was calling out to drop him but faf and RCB management sticked with him. It's not like they didn't have any other options. They had Rawat and Lomror who showed good form in initial matches, they even had Chauhan and Prabhudesai waiting in queue. But they persisted with Patidar and it paid off.",

But what's up with these individuals who want their hero to be appreciated all the time, and they abuse commentators for previous criticism, which was for that specific pathetic inning? Can't they accept that their hero was absolutely that day and move on? It's not like people are criticizing him even on his good innings. Just accept the criticism and move on. Don't come back at them and say, 'Fuck off' because their comment was about that one particular bad inning, that's it. They don't hate you. And the same goes for those obsessed with their heroes, trying to downgrade commentators every time that player does something great. It's the commentator's job to call out what's good and what's bad, which people don't understand. Then they'll whine about how pathetic and biased commentary exists. They don't understand they also play a role in that biased nature of commentary. The same goes for players; they have to accept they were bad that day. What do they expect, getting praised all the time? Then what about viewers? They are the primary reason commentary exists. And if you still don't want your hero to be criticized, then fuck off. Don't whine about biased commentary.\n\nReally sorry for such a long comment but it's absolutely shit how fans behave and go after commentators and people they are the major reason commentator hesitate to give their honest opinion",

But what's up with these individuals who want their hero to be appreciated all the time, and they abuse commentators for previous criticism, which was for that specific pathetic inning? Can't they accept that their hero was absolutely that day and move on? It's not like people are criticizing him even on his good innings. Just accept the criticism and move on. Don't come back at them and say, 'Fuck off' because their comment was about that one particular bad inning, that's it. They don't hate you. And the same goes for those obsessed with their heroes, trying to downgrade commentators every time that player does something great. It's the commentator's job to call out what's good and what's bad, which people don't understand. Then they'll whine about how pathetic and biased commentary exists. They don't understand they also play a role in that biased nature of commentary. The same goes for players; they have to accept they were bad that day. What do they expect, getting praised all the time? Then what about viewers? They are the primary reason commentary exists. And if you still don't want your hero to be criticized, then fuck off. Don't whine about biased commentary.\n\nReally sorry for such a long comment but it's absolutely shit how fans behave and go after commentators and people they are the major reason commentator hesitate to give their honest opinion",
