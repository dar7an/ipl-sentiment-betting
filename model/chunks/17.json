Looks like Ashutosh will come as impact sub. Late order hitter, good move.\n\nIf they can see beyond the price tag and bring in Vidwath, they are well covered. Vidwath, Arsh & KG in PP.

He can dominate in so many different ways, making him a true legend of the sport. But it's not just his talent that makes him special. Shashank Singh is also a fantastic leader and teammate. His ability to inspire and motivate his teammates is remarkable. He has a natural gift for elevating the play of those around him even when he doesn't play. Off the court, Shashank is a role model and a philanthropist. He uses his platform to make a positive impact, advocating for important causes and giving back to the community. It's truly inspiring to see how he uses his success to make a difference in the world. In conclusion, Shashank Singh, the Glorious King, or should I say the GOAT, is not only an incredibly talented player but also a leader, a role model, and a philanthropist. He has left an indelible mark on the game of cricket and continues to inspire fans like you and me. Keep supporting your favorite player and enjoy watching him dominate the field! \ud83d\ude4c",

Yesterday it was Virat Kohli who was being called a \"liability\" and today it's Kane  \"breaking momentum eating balls\". So many reactionary comments makes me wonder if some people here all are watching cricket for the first time and expects every ball to go for a boundary. It's not about a particular player it's just annoying to watch some people shitting on players for fun.

They had Nalkande in the team and didn't give him a single over. If you're not gonna bowl a bowler then might have played another batter and go hard in the middle overs. And don't get me started on the fielding. Nehra ji has made blunders this game, some grave mistakes that too which could cost them this match. This match should have been a free win, because you're playing PBKS at your home ffs.",
