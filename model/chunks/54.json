They got him pretty early, developed him into a spin beast, (I believe) started the experiment with him batting at the top, stuck with him and helped him remodel his action when he was banned.\n\nThat\u2019s how you develop and hone a player.",

Line and length was their main strength and it has zero reward in the current format. \n\n140 around bowlers are still able to trouble batters with yorkers and wide line bowls. How successful they are is a different question but pace still has some say in the game but mid pace bowlers I don\u2019t think will last longer with the current impact player strategy.\n\nYes there are all rounders effected due to team selection issues but this is also an area of concern which is not highlighted till now I guess",

If the umpires miss it, the opposition captain or the coach can report. \n\nChucking after legal deliveries brings no illusion. It's incredibly dumb to assume that.\n\nWhat we have is people speaking shit and nothing else",
