I know the last 2 games were terrible chases but for ngl for some reason it still seemed like the safer choice against a team like RR who have been amazing chasers.\n\nIf our openers can get it going and bounce back today then that's great, but it's scary due to how dependent this strategy on them firing off, so the lack of momentum from the last 2 games and the fact that there's Boult, the master of the 1st over/early wicket, is making me nervous. Rly hope I'm wrong and I hope they've prepped and have a calculated plan for RR, or they're going to get absolutely pummeled.\n\nRly hoping they set a massive target. 200-210 doesn't seem like it's going to cut it.

Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium pace 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

          "comment": "Ladies and gentlemen, let me take you through an astonishing display of batting prowess by the experienced sensation, Yuzvendra Chahal! Now, Chahal might not be a household name with the bat just yet, but today, he's etched his name into the annals of cricket history with an innings that will leave you in awe.\n\nYou see, Chahal has this uncanny ability to elevate his game whenever he steps onto that hallowed cricket pitch. It's like watching a painter create a masterpiece with every brushstroke, or a musician hitting every note perfectly. And today, we witnessed a batting virtuoso at work.\n\nChahal started cautiously, respecting the bowlers and the conditions, just as any smart batsman should. He caressed the ball to the boundary, exuding a calm confidence that belied his young age. But as he settled in, he unleashed a torrent of strokes that had the crowd on their feet.\n\nWith every shot, Chahal seemed to be doubling his average! His balance at the crease was reminiscent of the greats \u2013 a textbook cover drive here, a delicate late cut there. The bowlers were left scratching their heads, searching for answers as he danced down the pitch with grace and precision.\n\nAs the runs kept flowing, the tension in the stadium soared, and you could feel the collective heartbeat of the crowd synchronize with every swish of his bat. It was as if time had stopped, and we were all witnesses to something truly extraordinary.\n\nBut alas, all good things must come to an end, and so did Chahal's innings. He fell short of a century, but his contribution of 3 runs was worth its weight in gold. It wasn't just about the runs; it was about the way he played, the way he made us all believe in the magic of cricket.\n\nIn Yuzvendra Chahal, we see an undisputed star, a player who can turn the ordinary into the extraordinary with his bat. And as we reflect on this innings, we can't help but wonder what the future holds for this young man. One thing's for sure \u2013 the cricketing world will be watching, waiting for the next masterpiece from the brush of Yuzvendra Chahal. Cheers to a brilliant innings! \ud83c\udfcf\ud83d\udc4f",

It's like Ishant of yesteryears, who was advised by everyone to bowl fuller but the full delivery was just a floating ball without the force behind it and only later that he learnt to bowl the fuller ball rather than float it. Jansen needs to learn that art. A chat with Ishant or Gillespie whom I believe helped Ishant too is needed",
