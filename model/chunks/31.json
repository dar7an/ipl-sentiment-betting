They definitely are treading a thin line",

Batters have kinda struggled. \n\nThis is why I hate 225+ scores in T20, it negates a quality knock vs mindless swinging.\n\nNarine had a quality knock. He was denied any deliveries on the leg side to free his arms. Ashwin and Chahal regularly bowled really wide to him on the off. Boult with his slower bouncers. \n\nHe negated them all by playing straight. And playing brilliantly.\n\nAmong the tons so far, this is among the very best. Against a difficult bowling attack on a pitch which isn't necessarily a road.",

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possible.\n\nThe boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him.\n\nAfter considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. \n\nAfter two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Royal Challenger Bengaluru, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone!",

But what we're seeing is absolute opposite.\n\nIndia team will reach USA half tired after 2 months of this clown fuckery. Not properly prepared with weird tactics in IPL with impact rule. \n\nAnd as always, achieve fuck all in the tournament.\n\nIPL is the worst thing to happen to indian cricket.
