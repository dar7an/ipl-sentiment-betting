And how he gets to waltz back into the team?\n\nSo other players need to prove in international level, but Pant can come back after IPL stint?\n\nWhat more does Samson need to do honestly?

Let's see if DC can turn it around in these last 4 and get to a modest 170 ish.\u00a0",

Sanju may not have shown us great results in T20Is so far but he sure has shown enough potential - he can bat sensibly when things are tricky and very well knows how to change gears.
