Shreyas anchored the innings in KKR vs CSK and even then he only played only 32 odd balls. That was a real anchor innings. Not the 60-70 balls with 140ish SR on flat tracks anchoring like Kohli does. Even though both the teams lost only eventually, shreyash's anchoring innings was more tolerable than Kohli's anyday.",

They still give legendary performances when they aren't in their prime anymore but that assurance fades away. I believe we are witnessing Bumrah in his prime rn, and its absolutely glorious.",

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin b0ner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",
