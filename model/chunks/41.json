Their chances would have increased had they been batting first. They should consider it a good chasing practice They may have to chase on big occasions like playoffs. Sorry RCB fans, I don't think your team has much of a chance, but this is cricket and an RCB upset will make things interesting.",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for RCB this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of RCB on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think RCB will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.",

Taking singles in odi means that you're well settled, but not necessarily and we have to pay the price in crunch matches where we have to set up a big total. I know we bring fucking kl rahul along as well and rohit was very cautious but they're both looking to hit big this season but kohli isn't. Please don't bring jadeja along. Humble request",

Strike rotation, fitness, 1s into 2s are all secondary skills in T20 cricket if you can't hit boundaries.\n\nThe era of 'take it deep' is over. We're in the 'put it deep' era.

His straight shots have disappeared for some reason. \n\nEven with straight bat he tries to play on the leg side more often than not. That\u2019s not gonna help him at all.\n\nThe only problem with playing straight is he has to judge the line well in advance which is the exact reason he is playing cross. He is not able to judge the line early and is trying to be play comfortable shots when ball is much closer. But all these shots are good when you are a power hitter and not timer of ball.",

When he showed his frustration when he got out, I can guarantee he was upset that he didn't continue his innings and fetch more runs rather that anger at himself at his failure to accelerate. He just relishes his celebrity superstar status. This celebrity worship in this country for the past decade has led to our barren trophyless run.",

Conversely, if we need a longer face to bowl in the middle overs, Dagar can replace Rawat as a Impact player to maintain the attacking momentum.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Kohli is not woefully out of form, he hasn't been able to accelerate at a ideal rate and that's something you can trust a player like him to fix.

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Impact in line and that was dropping to hit the base of leg stump. Swapnil Singh, hit for a four first ball, gets the big wicket of Markram next. Kohli can't hold back his laughter as du Plessis takes Swapnil aside for some instructions.

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",
