Losing power play wickets is mattering less and less if they've attacked up front. Fully expect CSK to take a chunk out of this chase up front if Ravindra can connect with the ball. \n\nHate to overhype the kid when it's not a DC game, but if Mcgurk was playing here and had a decent game, he might make you 40 from 20 on a slow wicket anyway, and let everyone else pace their innings outside of the power play. \n\nI also hate to jump the gun, but without some second half magic or bowling magic, it feels over already.",

You think it was coincidence? You think GT and LSG the new teams (which are looking to increase their popularity) making continuous playoffs in their initial years is just a coincidence?

Playing with a 1 batter less while batting first, causes everyone to bat too conservatively \n\n4. Playing Nandre Burger instead of Keshav Maharaj as the impact sub on this pitch\n\nAshwin + Chahal + Maharaj would have been great for middle overs spin choke and wickets. Boult, Sandeep, and Avesh would have been enough for the initial powerplay and death\n\nRR is known to taper off in the second half, and I think that's happening again. The good part for them is that they already have 16 points so they'll probably still qualify but they may or may not finish in top 2",

Yesterday it was Virat Kohli who was being called a \"liability\" and today it's Ruturaj  \"breaking momentum eating balls\" Gaikwad. So many reactionary comments makes me wonder if some people here all are watching cricket for the first time and expects every ball to go for a boundary. It's not about a particular player it's just annoying to watch some people shitting on players for fun.

The chance is probably 100 times less than RCB qualifying with 14 points but it is still there and trust RR to fuck off their chances from great position!\n\nEdit: DC & LSG game still there so my point is Wrong.
