Varun stares into the souls of the audience. A wild Narine says, \u201cI chuck, I chuck,\u201d loudly. But wait, there\u2019s more. A wild Neeraj Chopra approaches, removes his wig, and guess what, it\u2019s Suyyash Sharma. Kingku goes on his knees and proposes to Suhana. The ground goes silent. A sad, tensed-up Kavya runs to the ground, stops the proposal, and is on her knees to propose to Kingku. SRK begs Kingku to reject her. Kavya says, \u201cIf Kingku says yes, you can have the IPL trophy.\u201d SRK rejects the offer, saying, \u201cI only want Kingku.\u201d GG says, \u201cEk rejection ne aapko IPL trophy nhi dilayi hai.\u201d Kingku says, \u201cI want you, Shah Rukh. I thought Suhana was you in a wig.\u201d But wait, Chandu cuts the sleeves of Kingku, revealing a new tattoo with the golden prophecy written on it: \u201cTHALA FOR A REASON.\u201d The whole ground starts chanting, \u201cCSK! CSK!\u201d Whistles echo. SRH and KKR teammates start having an orgy while Thala comes and takes away the trophy, saying, \u201cThala for a reason and Thala for another season.\u201d In the end, Harshit Rana gets a ban for 7 seasons.",

It's going to be amazing, everytime we play here, the crowd come out in large numbers. The biggest occasion in the cricketing event. We have to stay nice and calm. It's a dream come true to be captaining the team in the final. I know what lies in front of us. We need to play well and get the result. You got to make the right decisions on the field. That's something we've done consistently in the last 10 games.\u00a0**We are playing the same team.**",

I don't want them bottom of the table. No, I just want them to start well every season and have hope and then slowly spiral into the inevitable 9th place with exactly 6 points. Every year, season after season until everyone just collectively decides that the franchise gets dissolved.\n\nSuck my dick KKR, every day you exist makes my life miserable.",

But when I saw SRH winning the toss and deciding to bat, this strange feeling washed over me. Feeling, telling me, what happened to India this world cup, the same thing is going to happen to KKR. SRH's openers are going to destroy KKR's bowling and KKR's openers are going to fail miserably. On paper KKR looks favorite, but I'll go with my impulse and say, SRH is going to win this match.",

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Starc. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",

Amidst deafening roars from the packed stands, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise etched\u00a0their\u00a0name in IPL folklore once again, adding another glorious chapter to\u00a0their\u00a0storied legacy.\n\nWhile star performers like Venkatesh Iyer and Nitish Rana played their part, it was the unheralded Rinku Singh who truly stole the show. With KKR teetering at 89/5 in their pursuit of 174, the left-hander displayed nerves of steel, smashing an unbeaten 42 off just 28 deliveries to guide his team home.\n\nFor SRH, Pat Cummins led from the front, both with the ball and the bat. The Australian spearhead claimed three crucial wickets before contributing a blistering 33 off just 18 balls. However, his efforts ultimately fell short as KKR held their nerve in the closing stages.",

For example for today\u2019s game there were talks about red soil layover like Wankhede signaling a run-fest. Similarly, games in the beginning of the tournament were being termed as equal competition for batters and bowlers but ended up being a slaughter ground for the bowlers and vice-versa in second half of the tournament.",

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Pat. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to bhuvi. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",

          "comment": "I think it is fair to say KKR is the greatest IPL team after MI and CSK. And that is not considering IPL trophies. \n\nIs a team where captains play a huge role in man management,  looking at Morgan, Gambhir and now Iyer, unlike MI and CSK where there has been practically a single captain. Iconic foreign players like Kallis, Lee, Shakib, Narine, Russell and now Starc have played integral parts in their campaigns. \n\nAlso has probably the least delusional and social media aggressive fans despite their high success, fans who actually understand cricket. Their home ground is one of the most iconic grounds in the world.\n\nAlso SRK and thus, has a huge Bollywood support surpassed only by MI perhaps (Not that it pertains to cricket).",

Super balanced, great pace bowlers with different roles (Starc, Arora & Hashit), two proper mystery spinners (Varun & Narine), pure intent openers (Salt & Narine), quality middle order (Iyer, Iyer, Rana, Angkrish), big hitting lower order (Rinku & Russell) + extra batter (Ramandeep) for the cherry on top. \n\nThe 22nd match against CSK was the only real loss. The others were a freak 262 chase from PBKS, and a Jos Butler special which went down to the last ball. \n\nYou don\u2019t finish group stage with a 1.428 NRR by accident",

He took Delhi to never-before-seen heights under his captaincy. We know now how DC is performing after not retaining him. It was a bitch move from DC management not to retain him and going ahead with Pant and it didn't work well honestly. Everyone is talking about Pant and Sanju but no one giving enough credit to how Shreyas has captained and taken two different franchises to the next level. (Ofc, not taking anything away from the KKR management including Gambhir this season, they have been phenomenal)",
