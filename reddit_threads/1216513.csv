1. Warner knows that he can't go at high SR and hit boundaries too much so he converts 1s to 2s to keep his SR decent and run rate up. And when he gets tired and gets out by trying to hit out at the 15th over say he is excused or people don't criticize him too much because ""He is tired. He converted 1s to 2s, such character."". If that is the case, shouldn't he come down the order or sacked?

2. Warner is actually just trying to make most of whether runs he is offered and running as hard as he can to keep run rate up. But since he gets tired he can't hit out anymore later. If that is the case, shouldn't he just conserve energy, not run hard, and hit later?",1

I mostly follow matches on cricbuzz, so the first info I have about a ball is what was scored by the batsman. So seeing ""4"" is disappointing. But then you see the catch was dropped. Yeah it's a dropped chance but and there's the initial disappointment. But At least it relieves me that the bowler seems to be getting things right, and the over might not go for much if he keeps his cool. And that seems to have happened right now as well, with Samad's wicket",7

Garg looked ominous in that CSK match. Scored at 180 SR playing proper cricket shots. He can open for us in future if we are unable to retain Bairstow in auction. Samad is a good hitter and will be a great asset if his bowling gets good enough to be bowling 2 overs per match. Abhishek did well today and for me, he has the most potential among the three.",19

i was working at a restaurant in Canada and there was a guy working with me - Lovepreet. Pretty chill guy, showed me around and stuff but few months down, he had to shift cities. Fast forward 2 months, my boss calls me and tell me there's a new person joining the kitchen lovepreet and asked me to show them around. Now, I thought why didn't he just tell me lovepreet is rejoining, and what the fuck should i show him, he already knows his stuff alright eh.

So next Monday, that person comes and i ask my boss where is lovepreet? is he here yet? He tells me, yes lovepreet's in the kitchen, i go and i don't see him. and oh fuck, i go back to my boss and tell him, i don't see him. He's quite confused because i was referring to lovepreet as ""HE/HIM"", he stops me and tells me this is different person and it's a she. 

tldr - guys and guys in punjab have similar names, just got reminded of a fuckup i did when I saw the name Simran",7

big appeal for catch behind. Turned down. SRH don't review, but the umpires now send it upstairs with a soft signal not out. Yorker wide outside off, he looks to jab at that and there's a sound as it goes through to the keeper. Third umpire Barde said this review is for bump ball...so the umpire reckons there's bat on it. Which might well mean Mujeeb will go here, because that doesn't look close to being a bump ball and it could be conclusive based on the replays. They haven't checked for the actual edge, no Ultra Edge used, so the umpire thought that was edged. So Mujeeb reviews that decision! Now we'll have Ultra Edge.

That has to be some of the most braindead cricket I have ever seen. Why would you refuse a single if it gives you a chance to sit out the most dangerous bowler in the world, and with 4 wickets in hand? Just why?  
On that note, why would you eat a review up and take it away from the in-form batsman who is playing right now?  
On that note, why would you risk a shot as a captain who anchors the batting, while you have already gotten 13 runs from the over?
