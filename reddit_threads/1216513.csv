"If KXIP lose today, then their campaign for this year might as well be over. I feel the same way for SRH. Too many injuries and uncertainties. Can’t see them doing anything beyond qualifying for 4th at this point.",7
"KXIP really should play Mujeeb. It’s lovely to have a death bowler, but both Neesham and Jordan have been carted and Mujeeb’s bowling is a class above either of theirs. He is too good not to be in the side.",9
"As a neutral, this has gotta be one of the hardest choices. On one side you've Kane Anna and on the other side you've..... well Shit, SRH it is",8
[deleted],4
"I think KXIP can try to mix it up and opt to bowl if they win the toss. If they can dismiss Warner early(Shami definitely can) they can expect to chase an easy total. But looking at their luck, this will likely be the match where Bairstow and Warner goes berserk and go back to their best.",6
"It's really strange that KXIP are where they are. They're really not a team that should be down there. If they can't recover, it's a leadership problem and nothing else. I've played in terribly led and brilliantly led teams and it's evident inside the first couple of games if you'll make it as a team.",17
"Does anyone know if Shane Watson uses a smaller bat in size or he's just way too big? I think it's the former, since if you look at guys like Gayle, Russell their bats look pretty proportional to their size!",3
"Also why was Pooran keeping the last match? He's a brilliant fielder who should be utilised in the field, instead of being behind the stumps, whereas KL who's all the captain can keep and micromanage better from behind the stumps!",2
Hoping for cracker of a game today. Would love to see Gayle and Mujeeb in KXIP playing XI,9
"KXIP have the best opening pair rn

It will be stupid to change that by bringing in Gayle",8
[Gavaskar is really tiny.](https://i.ibb.co/cbWPFyp/Screenshot-from-2020-10-08-18-30-19.png),1
For KXIP fans- |Red Pill- Gayle doesnt get a game without disturbing the best opening pair rn| |Blue Pill- Gayle will surely come|,2
"Not sure whom to root for.  I prefer the brand of cricket SRH play, but really embarrassed for Kings XI who are again struggling to win games.",6
"Come on cricket experts, why don't you see Gayle carries a bit of baggage if he plays in the XI? Sore back, can't take quick singles, can't run 2s/3s, more pressure on batting partner to change his game, can't field anywhere except short fine leg, range of motion while batting is limited due to sore body. He'll punish the bad balls but will SRH feed him any?",8
Looking forward to getting raped by Warner today who hasn't found form yet.,3
"Some interesting stats from Cricinfo:

1) Agarwal has faced only four googlies this season, but has been dismissed twice by them; 57% of Rashid Khan's deliveries this season have been googlies.

2) Warner has scored a half-century in each of his last eight matches against the Kings XI.

3) The Kings XI concede 14.8 runs per over in the death overs, the poorest among all teams.",7
I think Kumble is responsible for Kings' XI shitshow.,4
"Just a friendly reminder: that no matter what happens in this game CSK will drop a position in the points table. So, if your teams loses it won't be all doom and gloom.",14
"Are my ears ringing, or am I hearing Stayin Alive by the BeeGees in the background?

Always takes me back to The Office scene with Dwight cutting that dummy's face off",13
Oh the two sides with the heaviest opening (top order) and crappy middle order face off,4
Pretty sad that Nabi hasn't played too much yet. He's been a pretty exciting batsman in IPL as well as the BBL.,2
"They changed ""motherfuckers"" to ""motherlovers"" in that Boat ad's song

Don't know which one's worse lol",14
Hoping that Nattu does well today,3
Give me a match of Gayle Pretty please.,7
Gaylestorm or stfu,2
"According to an ESPNCricinfo article from 2 days ago. SRH announced Prithvi Raj Yarra was Bhuvi's replacement, he's a left arm medium bowler. It would be pretty interesting to see how he does and if he gets picked.",5
Remember the hype Basil Thampi had a couple of years ago? I hope he gets another chance to live upto it.,3
"Hyderabad is winning it, they are really good while defending, even against dc they were successful, no Bhuvi might be a problem but Kxip isn't a gr8 batting team except top order",6
"Khaleel comes in for kaul

Obviously.",23
"lmao love the honesty from Rahul. 

Lose Tosses Win games",6
Pls give us Chris Gayle,2
Hotstar chat is like a car crash that you want to look away from but you can't stop staring at it either,5
Why would they give maxwell another game,1
What does Maxwell brings to the team except his fielding?,4
ofc Sunny G is surprised a Mumbai cricketer is out,-1
"Wouldn't have replaced Sarfaraz personally, Prabsimran seems too raw",1
Lmao how does Rahul forget his players,4
Rahul forgetting his Indian players lmao,6
"5 punjabis playing today

- Mandeep (C) 
- Prabhsimran 
- Arshdeep
- Abhishek
- Sandeep",48
"Mujeeb, let's go!",5
"We lack a strike bowler and are still relying on Samad and Abhishek as the 5th/6th bowler.  
 
The pressure is on Bairstow to perform. And by perform, I don’t mean a quick fire 20 in the power play. Even Saha can do that. Bairstow needs to demonstrate that his place is worth keeping out an express pace bowler in Stanlake.",7
Is there a rule that replacements need to sit out for few matches. I was expecting Prithvi Raj to be directly drafted into playing 11. Persisting with Sandeep will be a futile attempt.,1
Is the reason cricket match bot has rcb flair because it is the most popular flair in the sub?,12
Bruh anyone know more about the 2 new guys drafted in,1
Either kane or manish should bat lower down the order for the youngsters to play freely.,-2
Feels like a good day for Abdul Samad.,4
Why does Manish Pandey play so well for Karnataka and India but fails in IPL?,3
"oooo Prabhsimran cut his hair, interesting

he had a *patka*(turban) last year",6
[deleted],6
The KXIP dressing room must be awkward. Rahul speaks in Kannada to all his Karnataka bros. But there are also several local Punjabi players as well as foreigners. Hope they manage to get along!,1
Prab Simran was bought for 4.8 crore. Had a pretty forgettable debut last year. Good chance for him.,6
I feel Bairstow will pull through for us today and Samad will finish well.,2
"KXIP should try to follow DC’s lineup. KXIP also have decent talent with the Indian batsmen. They just need a good all-rounder in the middle and a good fast bowler who can bowl at the death. Rahul, Agarwal, Nair, Mandeep and Sarfaraz is a solid top 5. They need to utilise their foreign slots for their bowling and finishers.",3
"Enough playing conservatively by the openers in SRH. Our middle order is definitely better than what we had in 2016-2017. We literally had Moises Henriques as our number 3 and Yuvi at number 4 back then.  
  
Can’t blame the middle order anymore if the openers are slow.",11
"500 IQ move from KXIP to not field Chris Gayle. 

He's been Sandeep Sharma's bunny for over a decade. Will miss Sandy taming the Big Man with his predictable outswingers tho :(",2
Glenn Maxwell and Aaron Finch should go unsold next season.,6
Really hope that either Maxwell goes big this match or this is the last match for him for a while. He's doing absolutely nothing useful and I'd rather see someone else get a chance.,2
Did Arshdeep bowl last match?,2
Why is Arshdeep Singh playing over Ishan Porel?...,2
"Finally Punjab is looking like Punjab, and not Karnataka",12
Out of topic but Commentators and Social Media's tendency to compare every upcoming Indian left handed talented batsmen to Yuvraj has become a peak of annoyance.,25
"Mujeeb Ur Rahman was the second highest wicket taker in the recent CPL.

16 wickets, Avg 13.56, SR 15.3",8
"Can’t keep settling for 160 and then hope our bowling unit to defend it.

Now we need to go 180-190s. Bowling unit also needs some luxury.",11
"Bruh why do we have no balance.

5 batsmen and 5 bowlers.

Not counting Maxwell as a batsman",4
"Every app is a dating app, if you are creepy enough.",44
Can't just be me that finds this sub's obsession with Williamson a bit weird,6
Gayle is being paid to have a vacation in UAE. Truly the universe boss.,93
Rashid is our Bumrah. He will likely be played out but should provide a wicket if opponents go after him. He needs to be used exactly like how Rohit uses Bumrah.,1
Punjab's tactic of playing only 1 competent death bowler is an interesting one.,7
Who's favorite for tomorrow's match? DC are more balanced but RR are playing in Sharjah,1
I don't even want to win. I just want Single digit Kanos to reach double digit.,4
Is mujeeb a good death bowler?,1
[deleted],4
"Remember how Gujarat Lions qualified for playoffs in 2016 when Bravo was injured half the time and they had no strike bowlers? Yeah, kinda hope that happens to SRH this year.",10
Good evening boys,2
"Hope Samad gets to bat higher up the order today. If SRH have a platform like 100/2 after 13 overs, it would be better to send in Samad rather than give him just 6-7 balls towards the end. He's been hitting than ball so clean.",2
"Irrespective of who wins today, CSK will be at the 6th position in the Points Table after the game.

The only way they can go down to 7th place is if SRH score 265 runs and KXIP chase it down in 20 overs",6
Maxwell must have some serious dirt on someone at KXIP,26
"this is a weird theory but I legit believe the inclusion of Mandeep is allowing Rahul to try more punjabi bowlers and players in the field

Have talked to all of Harpreet, Prabhsimran and Arshdeep. Their hindi is terrible lmao. If you have lived in punjab you ll know people who just cant for the sake of it talk in hindi. Having Mandeep with Rahul allows them to have better communication perhaps. 

I should go be more prouctive at work...",5
"KL strike rate predictions?
I'd say 124",2
"KL, Mayank, Mandeep, Pooran, Taxi, Hooda, Bishnoi, Mujeeb, Shami, Hordus, Porel.  This I think should be the KX team.",3
"Ah shit, here we go again",2
"One of the main things that I love about IPL is that despite the fact that it is mainly all about the money, for Indian Cricket it is a way for youngsters to get experience against some of the more experienced and world class players. Along with that we get to see some unusual players playing together like Steve Smith and Jofra Archer after the incident in the Ashes as well as all the sledging or Virat Kohli and Adam Zampa after all the times Zampa has got Kohli in international cricket.",1
I want SRH to score 200 and Natarajan to bowl 12 yorkers. Is that too much to ask for?,8
SRH has the edge because Kaul is not playing.,10
Cottrell bowls garbage whenever he's put under pressure. Warner and YJB need to go after him right from the very first over.,2
"Gayle has to play over maxwell. Gayle will single handedly win you matches. Even if he's inconsistent, if he wins you 2-3 games by himself that's good enough. Better than Maxwell at least who can't buy a run in the IPL",1
Do they use drones for the overhead view of the stadiums?,1
There is an imposter among us (*yes you maxy*),2
What’s the changes in the team today guys?,1
"Both these times had been my 'second' team due to a specific player at some point of time(Ashwin for Punjab, Bhuvi for SRH). Now  just watching to see who can screw up worse. I think I like this better",3
Play Gayle you cowards,2
Come on lads.,2
"Don't get the calls for Gayle to play either

The opening pair have both scored runs for fun, Gayle's a liability in the field and can't run between the wickets either. Sure, he can clear the boundary but a lack of strike rotation will inevitably put pressure on whoever is at the other end",8
"SRH should trade Nabi with CSK for Hazlewood, balancing each other.",1
Why is Rahul not wearing the orange cap lol,4
WAIT ON,2
[deleted],2
"Alright lads, heres to a fun game of cricket",3
Punjab can't chase shit,1
Come on KP say it *MaKe It As ReWaRdInG aS pOsSiBle*,3
"So then SRH, which player are we gonna see gain the form of their life today?",3
Looks like a 200 wicket,2
Who's the keeper for Punjab?,2
Do SRH still have Hooda? Dude used to play every match despite not doing much...,2
Daniel Warner is going to score a 50 tonight. You heard it here folks!,2
Tuk tuk Warner,3
SRH needs mix up their batting line up. At the moment all the experienced batsmen are in the top order and none to finish the innings. They need to promote one of the youngsters to open and Bairstow should bat at 5 or 6,1
"Play like you once played, Davey. Just for the scenes..",1
Yay free runs,2
hoping a kxip win here...,2
"Warner Anna don't give us heartattack, please settle down then play. We need you",2
That was a nick wasn't it?,3
What was that sound?,1
Great bowling,2
Wonder why Pooran is not keeping wickets like last match,1
"Hmmm KL and Nicky P both are not keeping today, interesting",1
Fuck i thought it knickwd,4
Damn we keep making so many changes. Never a recipe for success. Poor Jordan's confidence must be so low,2
"Out of all the decisions Rahul took, not keeping is definitely the best",4
KXIP bringing another player back to form,3
"KXIP dugout must be hot asf!

Itni garmi mein Kumble kaun istemaal karta hai?",3
Punjab bowlers' death over economy is 16.65.,0
Shot of the match so far.,2
"Four runs, still not in good touch though. Jhonny need to step up today.",2
"David Warner getting into form against KXIP, y’all heard it here first",8
Cottrell is so ripped jesus,3
Warner showing Intent™,2
How come hotstar app has all the fan interaction stuff below the stream but none of it on desktop?,3
Who is bigger orange cap fan - KL or Warner?,8
"You feel bad for Stanlake , SRH really need a quality bowler in their XI",6
Not a bad over still. Good shape. Wicket coming next over,3
"KXIP : ""Are we the RCB now?""",7
"Cheeky shot, but dangerous. Kings XI has very Good bowling",6

David *kadak shot* warner,4
"If Pooran and Maxwell find their lost form, KXIP very well could be one of the best performing teams this season",4
Does KL not have the orange cap anymore or does he not feel like wearing it today lol,2
"English - I want pussy.

Hindi - Mujeeb-ur chahiye.",1
God Pietersen has an annoying voice,2
The KXIP jersey is so fucking ugly. Looks cheap af,4
Have been waiting to watch Mujeeb from the first match! Hope he does well.,2
Mujeeb has already conceded more boundaries than he did in the entirety of the CPL.,3
"Jhonny against spinner in powr play, I feeling bad. They are looking to take my boi away. Don't take risk YJB",3
Is shami going to be the specialist death bowler?,2
So. Many. Boundaries!,2
"If we keep up the rate, 260 is on lads.",5
"Ooh yeah Warner/Bairstow combination coming into form, thank us SRH lads",7
Finally mujib on the squad,0
Need 60 in PP else pitch might slowdown in the end,2
"Bairstow, Warner & Kanos in the same line-up seems like too many cooks spoil the broth to me.

Kinda like 2016 RCB. Batting is OP but shite bowling (especially w/o Boobie)",5
Oh no the Indian female commentator is back,4
Nice inswingers. Warner gonna edge.,2
Is Nabi injured?,2
Shami has been so good at the start and has been consistently taking wickets. Surprised that he hasn't started with the new ball. That pitch looks green af too.,1
3 different keepers in 3 games surely has to be an IPL record,6
2 wickets before end of PP for both teams will make this a spicy match.,3
Jasprit Bairstow looking a bit dodgy today.,0
Wasim Jaffer does look a bit like Pollard or is it only me.?,3
Very good over for kings XI,1
"Just tuned in, good to see my loaded boi Prabhsimran get another crack.",2
"KXIP have a problem with death bowling, SRH have a problem with death batting. Too very similar sides languishing at the bottom.",7
Economy of 6.5 jeez,3
Who is coming next Shami?,2
Anjum knows nothing about Kumble. He was never dependent on spin.,8
"Really want to see Punjab win one, but I'm a die hard fan of Warner, in spite of being a Kiwi 😂. So Srh it is 😌",6
Slats and KP deserve each other,3
Shami to do a broad,4
Hotstar comments experts are the best.,4
Wow lol we have too many keepers,45
"KXIP struggling with their bowling

KXIP fans : Get Chris Gayle",99
They dropped my boi Sarfaraz Khan :(,6
"Wait, who is keeping?",3
DJ's going a bit crazy with the vuvuzela,6
I can envision Shami’s ball hitting the top of off stump bowling to Bairstow,2
The cred winner is dead inside.,20
The payer of the match guy on the screen looks like he's dead inside.,8
okay who’s held the cred payer at gunpoint,5
Gautam Verma's enthusiasm was a miss imo,3
I hope punjab perform well today,1
Too short shamii,1
Is Vijay shankar still injured?,4
That Warner pull looked a bit like Watson pull from yesterday.,1
Want to see Shami come back in form and wreak havoc along with Bumrah when cricket starts again.,18
Warner had found some form against us during the weekend. But the version that has turned up today is the scary one.,7
Any update on Vijay shankar's injury?,7
Wasn't KL keeping for India in New Zealand? Why isn't trying to maintain his position as a wicketkeeper?,4
The keeper is doing his best Pant impression when it comes to chatter.,3
Warner is seeing red today and is intent on playing aggresive,6
Lloyd in great touch,2
Surprised Shami didn't slip in the inswinger to Bairstow that over.,2
"We are a good bowling unit, but id have hoped us to get the acheive the right consistency by now",1
"Anyone else also find this "" 175 strike rate when he plays a pull shot "" stat pointless. It's an attacking shot ffs , he will either score a boundary or get 1 run atleast",15
So SRH-250/0 in 20 overs?,3
They need to start making better ads,5
Good seeing Warner with aggressive intent today,5
Seems like the big brain behind the introduction of RTG in Indian cricket was Kumble all this while!,6
"Commentators: Warner is one of teh most intimidating batsmen

Broad: See if I care",8
"I love that KL, Ishan and Samson aren't first choice keepers. And the 4th one, Pant is so bad in the outfield, he can only play keeper. Bodes well for the future lol",10
Cottrell is very inaccurate. Very decent when he gets his length and line correct,7
"I have None of Rashid, Shami or Cotrell in my fantasy team. Masterstroke or a very dumb move?",8
Can't belive KL Rahul is playing an extra keeper just so he can wear the Orange Cap in the field. Big Flex.. /s,39
Today is the day of BIG SHOW,3
"If Kanos fails today, will they be looking towards Holder as an option? Gives them a hitter in the end overs which they so dearly need",5
Give width get smacked,2
Nice shot,1
Jonny Bairstow would make a great 20th century teacher who spanks the shit out of naughty kids,2
That was the most 4able ball you could bowl to bairstow,4
Baistrow and Warner firing together isn't good news for the other teams. Once they start firing there's no stopping them.,3
Can Rashid legally drink yet?,6
Warner century incoming,1
I'm liking YJB's vibes today. Let's Go!,2
Cottrell has to be dropped.,0
"**Both teams strategising before match:**

*Let's get the top order and the match is ours*


**Also both teams:**

*Bowling unit too incompetent to get the top order out*",3

Bairstow is all fired up today,2
Oh yeah it's all coming together,6
"Man, this is painful to watch.",4
Cottrell getting wrecked man,3
Cotrell on his way to dinda academy,5
Cottrell's action seems like one of those custom bowling actions that you only find while creating your player in a video game.,8
"Bowlers like Pattinson and Nokia went unsold in the auctions but KXIP paid 8.5 cr for Cottrell, lol they deserve to lose",17
Cottrell has been a bit underwhelming tbh. He's had his moments but hasn't lived upto the expectations..,19
KXIP spent 8.5 cr and 10.75 cr on Cottrell and Maxwell. Lmao 😂😅😂,13
*Goti muh meain agaya bc*,5
Well shit Johnny looking like a gun today,3
Cottrell cementing his place in lords academy!,2
Who’s the keeper. 3 keepers 3 matches,5
"Srh needs a new strategy for now on

Usually the batters get a decent score and the bowlers defend.

Not the batsman NEED to score high to make up for the weak bowling",4
"I still can't get over the fact that YJB has managed to increase his ""rarest of rare units"" status by using a TON bat

What. A. Man",7
"Cottrell getting hammered man, srh of to a flyer start",8
"If Cottrell is not gonna bowl well in the powerplay, he is of zero use to the side.",7
If that was taken rhodes would have personally come and celebrated with the team,6
Yeah now this is some shite bowling,3
So we have lost our only good aspect of bowling in powerplays and taking wickets early on 🤡,9
4 overs 40? This is not the SRH I know,9
"should've used mujeeb here, no?",2
"It hurts me in my soul when Cottrell concedes runs, he seems like such a joyful person",36
"Sanjay Bangar: ""The ball is a ball that the bowler loads up..""",5

KXIP is the perfect team - helping other teams come back in form,3
"Things hotstar are doing instead of increasing FPS & bitrate -

* Adding video calls

*  Fake crowd noise

*  Photo comments",3
Shame came to take wickets,1
We are the team which other teams play to get their out of form batsmen into form. First Watson now Bairstow and Warner (not out of form just underperforming wrt their high standards),1
"Which IPL cricketer has the Ideal male body and peak performance?

My nominee: Amit Mishra",3
Imagine letting SRH get off to a good start in IPL 2020,5
"Is Sheldon Cottrell overrated to be playing IPL? He isn't a death specialist, haven't got any serious pace and is neither an all rounder. I'm sure some indian pace bowler can attack with new ball alongside Shami just as good as Cottrell.",3

Dropped,2
I still don't think this team is balanced. No batdeep and still not much of a bowling depth,2
KXIP solved the problem of being shit at the death by being shit everywhere so you can't just criticize their death bowling.,9
Also why the fuck did we get rid of Curran. Atleast his bowling was decent,10
When you have the orange cap but your team is at the bottom of the table,3

Thank you KL,1

We started with 4 Karnataka players and 0 Punjab players in this lineup. Now we have 2 Karnataka and 3 Punjab players. I have a feeling we will be back to 2 Punjab players in next match with +1 increase in Bengal players.,2
Good attempt! Looked like..,2
Who has YJB sacrificed before this match?,3
save us Shami.,3
Come on KL bro,2

Is it only me or does Rahul look broken,5
Gotta take those. Difficult tho.,3

That's poor,2
He he he .. Bairstow,2

Would love to see a century today by either teams,1
Kl Rahul has the Koach dead eyes he has usually had for RCB,7
"To people saying KL looks broken, he has always looked broken",10
KL should keep wickets,1
Bruh we already lost this game. This has to be the worst side in Ipl history.,2
Nice fielding in point of srh view,7
This is a dream start for SRH. Kings are looking out of sorts already.,7
This is the typical W-JB approach that we saw last year. This is exactly what we need. A truckload of intent.,12
KL transforming to KLPD,9
"YJB babyyyy, go go go",2
How many more losses till KXIP is out of the playoffs race?,5
Perfect fielding to ruin your premium bowler' confidence and figures,8
Wow normally these two are a bit conservative at the start but today it's all fireworks.,3
Warner literally trying to cunt every ball for six,6
Hopefully this is the game Warner and Bairstow find form again,5
"It might seem like a small thing considering that he went for 28 runs in 2 overs, but the worst thing about Cottrell’s bowling for me was those 6 wides. 

He seems to bowl more of them than most club cricketers.",10
All the KXIP fans getting sad but y’all gotta realisze that your openers will destroy our bowling too lmao,23
Not even surprised at this point. Of course both of them are firing today.,43
Mark Nicholas talks so much rubbish. Hard to listen to,7
"Bad start but we can turn this around, let's go King XI",5

The Warner that used to carry our asses to playoffs every season is back,26
There's something very likeable about SRH. Two ginger dickheads cunting everything at the top of the order.,11
Both the batsmen are throwing their hands at everything atm. They got the start,3
KXIP is disappointment personified,1
SRH is the only team where all the players have an orange cap,9
KL reminiscing the time when he lifted the IPL trophy in his head before the 2016 final.,11
Shami is so good,3
No six yet lol.,2

KXIP bringing the SRH opening duo into form. 2020 KXIP has became a meme,6
"KXIP have not taken a wicket for 155 balls now. Last wicket, that of Rohit in the 17th over in the MI game.",28
Shami going to wear the cap that was in Rahul's ass,5
"Kings reacting to everything and not sticking to a plan, Rahul has some learning to do",7
People make jokes about Rashid’s age but Shami is literally balding. Definitely there a lot of players fudging their age by 1-2 years minimum.,3
Wow! It’s been more than 25 overs for KXIP without a wicket,11
"I really thought kxip would win this IPL , silly me lol",11
Wonder if Johnny is going to throw the kitchen sink at Mujeeb this over just to maximise the heck of the powerplay.,3
Maxwell runs weirdly slow,5
Really hoping CSK don't make top 4 and possibly top 6.,2
Nice stop,2
Bruh Jonty will be hella disappointed today,6
Oi Maxi that was dangerous,1
I read Warner and Bairstow had worst PP strike rate for openers (except Narine) this IPL in Cricinfo before match started. They had to jinx it.,11
Maxi paid for fielding,4
Punjab can still make a comeback because SRH doesn't bat deep but they need to wake up first and take this game seriously,4
Still recovering from (Jadhav's) hangover yesterday,9
"That’s a dangerous way to stop a ball, not worth saving a dive or even just giving away an extra 1-2 runs.",6
Can KXIP even take a wicket in Dubai?,3
"Who would you rather have in your ODI and T20 side if you had to pick one, Warner or Bairstow?",1
God mark Nicolas is especially bad tonight,2
Can always trust kxip to bring opening partnerships back in form,5
Man years after years after rcb punjab might be sometimes the most frustrating team to watch,2
2 over late bowling change..,3
I guarantee you Cottrell is Kumble's choice through and through. I remember him buying Krishmar Santoki for MI back in 2014 when he was our coach. Does anybody remember Santoki?,5
The scoreboard looks like this is Sharjah,3
"Since KXIP last got a wicket, they got hit for 62 in 3 overs by MI, 180 by CSK, and now another 50 by SRH.",50
Swann is the best salesman lol,31
Is Rahul's catch really considered dropped? It was not a super easy one,9
I can't believe how much coke KP and Slats do before this.,9
"nobody:


fake crowd: wooooohhoooooooo",18
"The way these two coordinate while running, you would think they play for the same country. 2 three's already",21
lol Mark,1
Stop talking shit. Rahul didn't 'forget' he wasn't wearing gloves,11
Not out,1
Not much more Rahul could've done for that drop tbh,6
Is there a record for most overs gone without a wicket for a team?,6
"The last wicket KXIP had was against Mumbai at 16.1 overs.

So almost 30 overs wicketless.",19
Lol Mark Nicholas killing all the banter,2
Wicketkeeper is summoning ancient demons with that chanting,2
Mujeeb been our best bowler,8
Props to Rahul for sticking with Maxy. Hopefully he fires today.,2
KXIP bowlers are wicketless from last 27.3 overs conceding 305 runs.,47
Bro did you really need to send that upstairs? How tf you so blind?,2
Direct throw would have been out,3
Why did he go up lmfaoo,1
"Warner looks like he's born to dive lmao, look at that",7
Imagine thinking Warner can get runout,5
Yes Mark I believe you really love that car.,6
KL Rahul plays for SRH because he has an orange cap just like the whole SRH team,4

r/therewasanattempt - a subreddit for the fielders who try to runout David Warner in t20s,28
Is Warner the greatest runner between wickets of all time? I know that sounds ridiculous but who would be better than him?,6
KXIP needa buy a proper captain lmao. Should have tried to buy Morgan instead of Maxi,7
Shankar 1D right there,11
Surprisingly we haven’t seen a single six.,13
"""I just wanted to go back to that point about Rahul's cat...HOW ABOUT THAT ALTROZ IT$ GREAT WE LOVE IT WE TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE LOVE IT GREAT CAR FOR DRIVING ON ROAD$""",25
What are India's chances in the upcoming Australia series? Odi T20 and tests.,4
Mujeeb's bowling well,4
Kumble has not aged well has he,6
"When you see Warner moving quickly as a little boxer, that is usually good news for SRH. The boy is busy with his footwork & showing signs of form",9
Without the IPL we never would've had a Bairstow Warner friendship and all our lives would be worse,12

It’s humiliating to make subs wear that yellow vest IMO,6

KXIP isnt just a team but a platform for all the players to get back in form.,5
Is Rahul clueless or that's just his default look?,5
I have a feeling the only thing that stopped kxip from playing mujeeb last time was that it was Jordan's bday,6
Hotstar showing hotstar subscription ad on premium content which only subscriber can watch is peak marketing,67
Warner's dive was better than a swimmer,4
Imagine _genuinely liking_ Altroz.,13
Dk is a lucky mf,3
So guys how would you rate rahul's captaincy so far this season and how does it compare to Ashwin?,1
Suppose there was a player who couldn’t bat or bowl but has outstanding pickup and release when fielding and has a 100% accuracy when throwing at the stumps from anywhere in the 30 yard circle. Obviously such a player doesn’t exist but would teams ever include such a player in the XI?,7
"Not going to lie Warner and Bairstow are the last people, I thought would be friends.",8
"We can do this, get these two wickets and we can shift the whole momentum.",1
When will Bhuvi recover?,1
That foreigner dude pronouncing *Kamala Pasand* is my jam today.,4

Maxi bowling to Warner. Hmmm.....,2

In my mind I always think YJB stands for Young Johnny Bairstow.,5
another IPL BATTING POWERPLAY bois!,3
Hoping that the usual concentration loss wicket after a break doesn't happen,1
KXIP and CSK just look dead inside,3
Imagine SRH thrashing this joke of a team wicketless like CSK did,8
Keeper is too excited for each delivery...,5
Weird bowling change,8
Gayle: if baithe baithe paisa kamaye had a face,9
300 runs without a wicket for KXIP,11
"Preity fussing about the missed run makes more sense now, after seeing Punjab play a couple of games.",2
Have they even played the same death bowler at least twice in their games?,5
Here come the 2s,3
Warner and Bairstow wasting their 1 blitzkrieg of the season on KXIP,11
How the do they run twos by hitting it to the fielders,7
Still no Gayle. Wow.,1
Priety Zinta:  Where's the penetration KX?,-5
Just 6 off the over. Well done Maxi,1
Management should've tried to buy a captaincy candidate in auction before jumping the gun with KL. Gayle and Mandy are better captains but they were never going to play in first XI.,4
Is that Simran keeping in place of Pooran or KL?,1
Anyone have trash quality on hotstar,1

Pies from Bishnoi. He's usually very good in his first spell,3
Has Arshdeep bowled yet?,3
Can someone explain the mid season transfer in this ipl. Which players can the teams trade for?,11
Gayle sick? Been out partying with Usain Bolt again?,18

Ahhh man srh hammering the bowler's to death here,3
"Anil keeps telling it's a tough game for bowlers and they have to keep coming back, meanwhile Bairstow deposits one more on the stands",4
Kumble always looks like that but considering the team's situation he looks like he's got into nihilism and finds everything meaningless.,7
M Ashwin is better than Bishnoi,4
J. Krumble's team is krumbling under his watch.,4
What’s the record for losing the most no. of matches in a season guys?,5
Seems like KXIP only serve to get other teams into form,1
Finally we get the warner bairstow opening partnership we wanted.,3

SRH going 225,5
"Mark Nicholas has been acting so beta all tournament. First, when he criticized Dhoni, he was like ""Sorry it was an observation, not criticism"" and now he asked Kumble about Gayle and the 3 wicket-keepers and he's like ""Sorry for asking tough questions."" 

Good god, aren't commentators even allowed to ask THIS? I remember how Danny Morrison was earlier asking Kane Williamson about being benched and he was abruptly stopped by the co-commentators.

No goat coach/captain combo can revive fortunes of this Kings team. Such a weak bowling arsenal!,7
Great running guys,3
KP: Put it in the hole every ball is an event gotta keep going,3
No use of wicket alert in the first innings,4
KXIP have now conceded 345 runs in 31 overs without picking a wicket. Last wicket was Rohit Sharma last Thursday,6
This guy is slightly better than Cottrell man just drop Cottrell lmao,4
Any other out of form teams want to fix that anytime soon?,4
Warner is averaging 43 so far this IPL and yet he 100% has not hit his stride yet.,5

David Warner against Punjab is basically r/fuckyouinparticular,7
Makes me remember 2009 DC's Harmeet Singh. Dude was a proper military medium but was a key piece to DC's success.,5

Are you allowed to tape bats?,3
Over 30 overs without a wicket for KXIP lmao,3
Steve Smith overpriced with 11 crores. He is the same style of player like Root or Williamson,4
What is the point of Badrinath in the Dugout?,1

Not a bad over tbh. Now watch rhe next ball go for a 6,1
Arsedeep > Bashnow,2
Still hard to believe YJB and Warner play together and are good mates. Can only happen in IPL,10
Will KXIP take a wicket this match... It's been a long long time..,3
The innuendos are strong tonight,6
KXIP last wicket - Rohitman 70(45) c Quiche b Shami - 189* balls ago.. Hmmmm,4
That's why I said KXIP should be relegated to some state leagues.,3
Should relabel this the stat-padding stadium.,1

Arshdeep looks like one of the better bowlers today,5
Why is he bowling full tosses?,1
SRH vs KXIP is probably peak battle of openers.,11
Exactly 100-0 from exactly 10 overs is satisfying,48
Thats a perfect score 100 in 10 overs with 0 wickets,18

"Arshdeep looks more wayward than Khaleel, Umesh and Siraj. How is that even possible?",5
0 extras?,2
 5th century stand. Backbone of SRH.,8
Arshdeep managed well. I thought this would be 20 run over,2
KXIP are just depressing to watch,3
Things back to normal for SRH,2

"5th century stand between these 2.

Holy Shit that's scary.",17
Is there more consistent opening pair than Barstool and Warner in IPL? Or has there ever been one? Good on B&W 👏👏👏,3
So who are the KKR players who have not hit their stride yet? I can expect them to bitchslap our bowling in the next match,3
I think kxip needs to do a delhi like change here,3
Reddit hates goDaddy. Who endorses them?,2
Okay. Need to get a bit experimental in our batting line up. Good start. Why not send Samad at 3 to give him the opportunity to blast off!?,2
Only a shit team like RCB can lose against a shittier team like KXlP,-1
I don't indians wouldn't let strangers in to their house for cleaning.... Does urban company even works??,2
"Come on guys stop it with the updates about being wicketless, we know it don’t make us suffer more",2
If SRT managed his money well he might be the richest Indian cricketer. But if he did not guess Kohli and Dhoni might've overtaken him ?,1
"Seems hot, it's as if there playing in the desert.",1
"Who sets the field , so shit.",3
With all the wickets in hand we will surely get past 200 roght,2
"India's future fourth pace bowler along with Tyagi, Mavi and Nagarkoti?",6
Punjab ain't taking any wickets this year,1
Gayle was sick today that's why didnt play today,1
"She's going on and on about ""Wood in hand """,1
Got to say Dhoni's performance in ads are better that his performances onfield,7
KXIP last wicket - Rohitman 70(45) c Quiche b Shami - 189* balls ago. Poor Punjab,2
Two foreign openers destroying punjab in Dubai where have I seen this before,11
finally a 100 partnership by war-stow after so long,4
[removed],6
"YJB get his bats sponsored by TON to remind him he needs to score a hundred in white ball cricket, and play hundred balls in red ball cricket.",6
Lmao!,5
Maxwell be like: wait wtf is this field setting,11
The lesser seen reverse late cut,19
I'm confused.,1
I think warner has faked being a left hander all his life,2
Warner get sketch when playing shots like that,1
"Most 100+ partnerships in IPL:

9 V Kohli - AB de Villiers (71 innings)

9 V Kohli - C Gayle (59)

6 D Warner - S Dhawan (50)

5 G Gambhir - R Uthappa (48)

5 D Warner - J Bairstow (16)",9
All punjab need is these two wicket and it will be the house of cards.,1
"Aahhh bad luck, good shot Jhonny",1
Maxwell lol ing on Warner’s attempt,2
Why is Warner obsessed with switch hits,4
Smacked,1
Imagine Maxwell breaking Punjab's wicket drought,6
That was such a good save man FUCK,2
Thats just taking 360 batting to a new level,6
"My man just said I bat left 

Sike 

I bat right",9
They just can't catch a break,3
KL and Mayank will also do well tonight imo,2

YJB is gonna murder everyone.,3
That is outrageous from Warner,3
Glorious,2
YJB is in a mood today... Smashing,3
"Cleared the 10 rows, take a bow Jhonny.",4
Aight imma head out,6
I think I should take my prediction back,1
Wtf Maxwell?,2
Another double centuries against a karnataka based team today?,3
We're getting peak YJB tonight,7
KXIP is out of this game.,4
"Man, thi is so painful to watch smh",6
Bairstow best t20 batsman itw no cap.,2
You ginger legend,4
Jonny Bairstow babyyy,1
Scenes if the innings end without a wicket,3
250 is on the menu boys,2
At this point KXIP is starting to physically affect me,6
"I doubt anyone from KXIP management actually watches cricket. Because they didn't buy captain from 2019 auction. But they do bid for all big batsmen, end up buying couple of them sometimes, and main thing is that they don't bid for world class pacers, if they do, they get out of bid way too soon.",9
Pure class,1
"90 meters six , ufffff",1
So KXIP haven't taken a wicket in over 300 runs conceded,4
Having a cup of ginger tea in honor of yjb.,5
"KXIP will not be able to win even if their lineup include Bumrah, Chahal, Archer and Rabada.",5
Honestly even using Gayle as an all rounder would be less of a liability than Maxwell atm,9
35 overs and counting...,3
Get a wicket cunt!,1
What is the record for most overs without taking a wicket by a team in T20s?,2
"Bairstow getting his bat taped up so nobody sees that inside part is made up of rubber and outside part is covered by some wood, so all he had to do is touch the ball and it fly to boundry.. That's the secret why he scoring runs..",8
[deleted],3
Damn what a shot,4
"This is just pure hammering, just put them out of their misery bairstow and Warner",5
Maxwell giving away runs that he isnt even gonna score,7
This is ridiculous,1
Holy fucking shit Johnny killing it tonight,5
And I thought it would be a good idea for KXIP to bowl first for a change....,6
rip kings,4
If they don't score more than 200 today then I don't when they'll score,3
Stop it YJB. I can only get so hard..,5
"Ok, own up. Who was it that said something bad about Bairstow.",5
Punjabs bowling is in shambles. Giving major RCB vibes,5
Maxwell has been shit this ipl. Be it batting/bowling,7
They have unleashed the Kraken,8
KXI - Things change. Suffering is permanent,4
Toothless and hopeless,2
10 crores Maxwell smoked by 2.2 crores Bairstow,13
Bairstow 🔥😍,8
Can Punjab not take ONE FUCKING WICKET!!!,8
Bairstow has gone into energy conservation mode. No more running.,11
This is just pure torture now,4
KXIp is out of the IPL,2
SRH absolutely raping KXIP,2
Bairstow Butler gonna win us the world cup on their own.,5
That's what you get for bowling your part timer over your front line spinners.,11
"It even gone much longer,bc Wow. 200 strike rate",4
Luck ran out.,1
When Bairstow's on he's such a brutal joy to watch,1

"""maxwell shouted catch it but there's no crowds allowed""",10
YJB <3,2
"Guys, what's the average score at Dubai?",2
 Maxwell is so trash in IPL.,5

Till the time next time Rahul play's for India he'll have grey in his beard,5
"lmao, “out of form” Warner and Bairstow are #4 and #5 on the leading run scorers respectively. Tells you a lot about the quality of these 2",9

Not sure why KL was made captain. KXIP could have planned their auction better and then made a decision.",7
Is this the longest a team has gone wicketless in IPL ever?,4
Gobsmacked Maxwell smacked for maximums,3
Is it 35 overs without a wicket now?,4
Maxi isn’t having a good IPL.,1
Bairstow wanted the strike,3
Anyone remember that game against RCB?,1
WoW We Are ShiT,3
Maxwell and Jadhav have been the most useless players this IPL,2
As soon as the batsmen realise maxi does nothing with the ball it's over.,6
"Thanks for taking the wooden spoon off ours hands KXIP

Moral victory already for RCB",1
How long was that second six?,1
Why again is maxy in the team?,3

"Rahul this, ABD that, Bairstow remains clear.",8
"Maxi will come and shit on the same pitch.

  


But I soooo want to him to smash :(",6
This is an actual EMBARRASSMENT not one wicket in 30 overs. Fuck this good for nothing team,9
Yeeting Johnny Bairstow,3
"Punjab has conceded 380 runs in 35 overs without taking a wicket. 

Is this some sort of record?",9
"Jeez

This is the perfect balance of running and boundaires",8
Kxip are fucked,3

Can someone ELI5 why Gayle is on bench even in this current condition of Punjab,2
"Poor KL man, gotta feel for him.",2

I know they made some changes today to help their bowling. But, seems like it is not working.",3
Freaking Ginger giving bad name to Aussies.,5
"Incoming worst season for kxip possibly, with what looked like such a promising start to the tournament 🥺",13
"Well done SRH, trample the weak",7
KXIP bowling and KL's captaincy are shit,1
Uptown Girl,3
That expression by KL Rahul.,5
Warney and Johnny > Faf and watto,3
Binga is just bored. He wants a wicket.,2
Reminds me 2019 srh vs rcb game,1
Thats a great yorker honestly,1
Each moment Kumble as a coach respect goes down and down. May be his stats was good just because he was coach when India were playing in India,1
Nice bowling by arshdeep,1
Nice yorker kid,3
Maxwell is playing because KXIP have a secret policy of always including one Aussie in the xi.,3
Rahul looks clueless,2
"SRH management before the match: Jonny you must play responsibly, we have a frail middle order

Bairstow: 70(35) take it or leave it",3
"This is a nightmare... 
A bowling unit composed of Shami, Cottrell, Mujeeb, and players from India's U-19 WC teams. What/Why/How...",1
This team should just be deleted from the IPL and we should have like a J&K or a Haryana team or something,6
"oye bhen ki laude Jonny kya maarre

T : Well played, Mr. Bairstow",3
Warner and Barstow Tag team champions,1
It's not even at Sharjah,1
Were we thinking KL as the next Indian skipper... really?,1
Good comeback in one ball? Wtf?,3
Gonna go wicketless for 40 overs unless kl comes on to bowl himself :(,2
KL should go to CSK after this season,1
IPL salary should have performance linked incentives.,3
This partnership was statistically due any match now.,3
"I had to check on cricbuzz... I thought they were in Sharjah

Just joined the stream...ffs man again missed amazing innings",5
"This is whats good about SRH. They know their bowling is weak because of Boobie not being there. B&W are grabbing the responsibility with both hands, going for the big target, to provide cushion for their bowling. They understand what's at stakes here.",5
*chuckles* my fantasy team is in danger :),2
KXIP play without a bowling line up. What an amazing feat!,8
"Is it too much to ask for ONE, just ONE vintage Maxwell innings. JUST ONE",6
This gives me vibes from That RCB match where they both scored century. YJB exploded and Warner just anchored to a century.,13
SRH back...,3
5th 100+ partnership for Warner & Bairstow in IPL. (16 innings),4
Maxi better score those runs he gave away in one over,3
Good Yorker ...,5
SRH scoring anything less than 250 from here is a win for KXIP.,6
In this case the way kxip are going i think kumble might have to come bowl,3
SRH haven't realized they aren't playing at Sharjah,7
"Warner takes a single. 
Bangar: that’s a good comeback from kxip.",5
31 overs since king XI took a wicket,5
Every over is a death over for KXIP bowlers,7
Tfw arshdeep is the most economic bowler,4
Anyone knows the record for the longest time a team went without getting a wicket?,2
New keeper looks like an side villian,-1
Does YJB use a specific bat sponsor for IPL or is this just a new one? Swear he was using Gray Nic still against Australia,3
KXIPs wicket keeper is Rinku Singh lite,10
Who is more RCB this season - KXIP or RCB itself?,6
I don't think rcb was ever this bad,7
“Johny Bairstow is bound to make a mistake now” Dugout commentators showing some real confidence in Johny 😂,9
"Lmao I just got a notif from Real Cricket 20

""kxip has had the most number of captains. Yet to win the trophy. Want to win it for them?""

They're like inse toh naa ho paega, game mein hi jeetlo
(T: they're never gonna win in real life, might as well win it for them in-game)",7
Kohli will get a wicket before KXIP,5
"Prabhsimran may be a nice lad, but his face looks punchable",5
Where are the twats who said Bairstow was overrated?,3
"Watching the Dugout since the start of this season, Sanjay Bangar is such a misfit in the English commentary box. he speaks so slow. He would be better off in Hindi commentary.",7
To those asking about Gayle. He was supposed to play today but is sick.  Kumble said so during his in game interview with Mark Nicholas,11
How many overs has it been now since they last took a wicket?,4
"Arshdeep is decent bowler, management needs to keep faith",6
Why isn't Rahul keeping?,2
"I still remember lot of fans thrashing Brad Hogg for saying that KXIP will end up last. Even though KXIP has a decent team on paper, Brad Hogg predicted correctly.",5
"I feel for KXIP fans, I really do.",6
Gun running,3
How the hell are they running 2s?,3
wait you have pooran and KL and you decide to let this guy keep...,6
I expected Arshdeep to get whallopped but he has done ok so far,5
Watch Rahul stat pad and score a captain's innings of 70(60) in a losing cause as they fail to chase the RRR,12
Arshdeep is impressive,2
Man...feeling sad for KL,4
"KXIP fucked up in the auction itself. With 42 crores in their purse they only managed to pick Maxwell, Cottrel, Neesham, and Jordan.",5
Wow they took 2,5
Warner and Bairstows running between the wickets is just fucking epic,1
Arshdeep is new death bowler,3
"How to wicket.

Punjab needs to read this book.",3
KL Rahul = Classfull & Clueless,3
Imagine thinking your season would have gone different had a short run not been wrongly called when you literally have no bowlers.,9
This looks familiar,1
Good bowling by Arshdeep so far honestly,1
Don't forget this is the 32nd over since Punjab took a wicket. Sike,2
Kxip looking to stop srh from scoring anything above 250+,5
"One wicket is all they need, it'd bring a smile to their faces. They can build on that.",2
Warner needs to go big now. Has slowed down after the powerplay,3
That siren is fking scary,4
That no ball call scared both our batsmen,6
35 overs since wicket is just pathetic,6
Lol Bairstow was shaken by that siren.,8
That fucking siren is so damn loud. I thought US dropped the bomb on UAE.,30
Scared the fuck outta me that siren..,5
Free hit coming up!,2
"Oh fuck sake Arshdeep, was just about to praise you for your Yorker skills",3
A free hit is just salt in the wound at this point,3
Oh yesss,3
KXIp haven't taken wicket for 11 overs,6
"Hi, I'm a wicket, What is a KXIP ?",11
Lmao for a moment I thought there was some emergency in stadium,14
At least our NRR won’t be bad after this match,6
Lol the grimace on his face,3
Poor guy has bowled so well. Hope this doesn't shatter his confidence.,4
"KXIP have the worst death over performance in the IPL so far. This match they fixed it by conceding death over runs before the death overs.


*KL taps finger on head*",10
Bairstow looked terrified when the siren went off,17
Hahaha what the fuck was that alarm. That would've been so scary irl.,8
The real meme teams are punjab and RR. Stop memeing RCB Losers.,11
"At least the two bowling changes today, Arshdeep and Mujeeb are bowling relatively solid. But still no wickets unfortunately",6
Arshdeep is bowling pretty well barring that no ball,7
Its hard to believe that kxip almost beat the best team in the league,3
"Me as a kL rahul fan feeling sad

Me as a srh fan feeling stoked",6
RCB should issue a statement that their team should not be compared to ultimate meme team KXIP. RCB doesn't deserve this much disrespect.,6
"KXIP have 2 of the top 5 in orange cap list and they have donated runs to Faf, Warner and Bairstow, the other 3 ppl in the top 5.",5
Arshadeep has been the only guy who's looked like taking a wicket.,5
"Warner sure shat his pants, no I didn't use sand paper this time",0
This Arshadeep guy is decent.,5
Wish Gayle was fit he would have given a good start against SRH bowlers,2
Natarajan mode by Arshdeep,3
"No wickets, no KL as WK. Coincidence? I think not. /s",3
Bairstow looked like he thouhht that was an air raid siren,8
Free hit to YJB uh ohhh,1
Have KXIP and RR ever developed a young talent?,3
Nattu is that you?,3
I'm sure that siren caused at least one heart attack across the country.,8
That no ball siren just gave me the fright of the day,18
Wasted freehit; freehit seems to be disincentive for Bairstow,2
"Oops, Even as SRH FAN I don't want to see this level of hammering...",3
Arshdeep's been the most impresive bowler,8
That no ball siren scared the shit out of me,12
[deleted],5
"Fuck, those sirens are something you hear when you're city is getting bombed",8
Can someone tell Shami this is the second innings of a test,9
I still can’t believe these 2 teams were the ones who gave us strongest competition.,4
Arshdeep only silver lining for kxip punjab in this match,8
Arshdeep can play for 2 decades with that action and run up.,7
[deleted],12
Is Warner gonna dismiss Bairstow again,4
This kxip team is giving so many rcb vibes right now,3
No human currently alive was living when Kings XI took their last wicket,11
Specialist fielder Glenn Maxwell with a good pick up.,14
Bet on Rahul to shave his beard and Get a win with absurd decisions...anyone ??,8
My god don't tell me these two are going to play out all 20 overs.,5
"In case someone is interested in keeping track of how long KXIP have been wicket less, they had conceded 248 runs in 21.3 ovrs since their last wkt (at the start of this match)",10
Now watch Arshdeep getting dropped in the next match lmao,9
So been 35 overs since KXIP last took a wicket. Doesn't sound inspiring at all.,9
bit of reverse there for arshdeep? looks a handy leftie,3
"Next match, Kings XI should just name all batsmen 11, as their bowlers do not get any wickets anyway.",8
That wasn’t a no ball? Too high.,4
"Andhra, Telangana brothers...Botta bomma song in mind watching SRH duo coming back in form!?! Or some other ??
(sorry I know, only this one and a Bahubali one)",12
Friendship ended with RCB...KXIP is the new meme team,8
Getting allout for 109 against this Punjab bowling #JustRCBthings,10
Wtf happened to our batting vs KXIP,10
[removed],13
Arshdeep bowling Yorkers for fun.,10
"Even after bowling so brilliantly, he gave 10 runs. Absolute state of KXIP.",8
KP sounds god awful. Absolutely terrible commentator to listen to,5
only Jaddu can escape the free hit siren,3
KXIP have been wicketless for 378 runs and 33.3 ovrs,9
SRH was my only hope for a low-scoring thriller. It's gone.,9
Individually.. Collectively.. Consistently.. Wtf is Anjum Chopra on about? She's making no sense,7
"I feel if bairstow falls, they might be able to keep seh under 200.",1
"*Has the best powerplay bowling duo
KXIP : What if I split them up, what's the worse that could happen?",1
SRH the only team that can get 10 runs with just running 2's,3
Arshdeep is very lucky to not get carted around with the kind of balls he has bowled so far.,4
Sharjah is so shit.  Opens cricbuzz.  Realises it's KXIP bowling.,12
KL is from the kohli school of captaincy,5
Bruh Dravid selling cars now uh,7
All KL does is stand there and scratch his head..,3
"130-0 in 12, even better than Watson-du Plessis partnership, no?",3
"Who is this Arshdeep  chap

Should be given a longer run. Could be the find of the tournament",5
These two remind me of Ganguly and Tendulkar.,2
Can we have AI commentators ? I wonder if a corpus of commentary transcripts exist ? GPLv3 will make it possible.,5
"Man, this game is so hard on bowlers. One little inch over the line and it’s a free hit",2
Arshdeep already has good control on his length. Line will also get in control pretty soon. Great bowler.,1
[*boi that aged well*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j0q0o6/-/g6uvb3x),2
250 on the cards boys... I was cheering for Punjab but this is just too entertaining,3
"Looking at how this match is going, both KL and Mayank need centuries to win today",2
KXIP can still chase this considering their batting,2
"leave two at end for arshdeep, see if he can solve end overs issue",1
"Just tuned in. 

What the fuck.",14
I want SRH to send in Samad next. He has the potential to be a great finisher in a couple of seasons.,7
"If there's a wicket, please don't send pandey to kill the momentum.",13
Kxip is RCB Jr,4
SRH don't really have any other big hitters other than Samad. Bairstow and Warner will have to really push till the 15th over minimum.,6
They still got 10 runs from this over.,8
KXIP arse deep in trouble.,5
Nice seeing arshdeep bowling well,1
I had high fucking hopes from both KXIP and RR at the start of this season. But they always jump lower than their heights.,6
KXIP is the new meme team,3
I’m tired robbie,8
Name of song playing in the stadium?,3
35 overs since king XI took a wicket,4
When can KXIP activate the “right to forfeit tournament” card?,12
Arshdeep honestly didn't go for much considering the situation he came into bowl. Just need to work on the extras but it could be the nerves considering it's his first match this season and he is bowling to two set batsmen in destructive mood.,9
"Arshdeep is bowling some good balls but he's getting away with so many full tosses and no-balls/wides, needs consistency",9
DJ tonight has great taste in music,6
Please be 2nd innings Shami,4
Inb4 KL Rahul and Mayank get out in the first over,11
I'm unable to imagine punjab playing in sharjah,5
Off topic : what are you having for your dinner?,6
"Ad: *4 guys rush and surround a lonely girl in rain*

Ad voiceover: *for more romantic and cute videos like this download Josh*",9
Lol warner has 9 consecutive 50s against kxip?,11
"bowling has tightened up a bit, good to see",3
"If it's RCB, half of comments would be shitting on Kohli's captaincy focussing towards his inability to take first wicket",4
Seems like YJB is losing gas.,8
Who's gonna bowl death overs?,5
RCB robber of a win there.,0
32.2 overs for Punjab without taking a single WICKET!!1,3
Ginger ninja it is,2
"My god how has KXIP become so bad, I was stupid enough to think that this year they have a chance of qualifying and they make mandatary 3 changes per match, Kumble partly responsible as well, who tf picks Maxwell for 10 CR after so many poor IPLs",5
They both look very tired. Punjab finally gonna get their wicket after almost 35 overs without one.,7
Hopefully srh decides to utilize all the wickets they have,4
"Dont give away your wicket pls

We need new meme material",8
Bairstow's terrified face while playing even scares the hell out of me.,5
Bairstow tired,2
KXIP is getting RCBed.,10
Lmao who is YJB?,1
"Anyone, any idea what's the record for the most overs bowled by a team without taking a wicket in IPL? 

Pretty sure kxip are into that territory.",4
"KL /Mayank were better before this match , Warner and Bairstow haven't done it as a pair before this.",6
Is the ground bigger or they are just that fast while taking doubles.,4
They are mis hitting now,2
Good to see some tight bowling,3
KXIP cannot catch a break even in polls,5
At this point I'd look to mankad if possible,6
Someone posted baby Bairstow’s picture. I cannot unsee it right now.,5
This ground suddenly looks and feels like Rajiv Gandhi International stadium.,7
They should terminate Punjab and give the franchise to a more deserving city like Ahmedabad for example,-3
Bairstow looks out of gas. I just hope he gives his 100% before getting out.,2
Damn the recency bias on that poll. Warner and Bairstow were good only this match and probably one another,-1
Shami Kabab vs English Ginger,2
Makes me wonder how Ashwin would've done with this team. Dude would've at least Mankaded a couple of batsmen and gotten the breakthroughs...,7
These 2 have ran so hard and spent so much time in the crease that fatigue has kicked into them. :/,4
"Swann slips out a laugh at the performance of kxip, says that he shouldn't laugh about it, laughs anyway 😂😂😂",9
Fuck Jonny that's some SLAP,2
Baristow face looks like tired lion,3
"Imagine being a KXIP fan, can't imagine",8
Lmao i thought he was getting tired. Smoked that one!,7
It'll be completely soul crushing for KX bowlers if B&W stay not out.,7
This is fine.,6
[deleted],1
"KXIP has now given away 380runs (and counting) without taking a wicket. Must be the worst ever bowling performance in IPL history.

Edit: It ended up with 408 runs and 219 balls (36.3ov) without a wicket.",10
"For Bairstow’s batting, bowler should wear a helmet.",7
This is like 1919 all over again.,11
Every match that kxip play makes me sadder that we lost against them,3
"Ever since his comeback, Warner seems to have been more of an anchor in LOIs compared to his earlier years. He did score a quickfire century in a T20 last year, but otherwise he doesn't seem to be going all out with attack.",11
What's your predicted score?,1
Why does Bairstow look like he is exhausted and is swinging his bat to lose his wicket but somehow ends up getting a boundary.,6
250+ ?,4
"Yyy- Yorker , Yorkshire, yjb",4
If we merge KXIP & RCB - I bet it will be still a shit team.,6
Fuck 3 bowlers from Mi in top 5.,6
James Pattinson has the best economy among the MI pace trio. Never would have guessed that XD,6
The one thing ive never seen from Shami is him not taking ANY wickets. Its weird to see.,5
"At this point we're just waiting for one of them to have sweaty gloves, not change it and have the bat twist in their hand when playing an aerial shot. only way we get a wicket right now.",2
MI with that OP bowling line up lol,1
"Dunno how many here do season fantasy, but wanna share I had Bairstow for every single SRH match except this",3
"Honestly, there is so much mediocrity in the IPL that no selection decisions should be made based on it.",5
Why do most franchises get a city but KXIP and RR get a state?,9

"They showed a stat when Sheldon Cottrell came to bowl for the first time about his line and length. Only 7% of his deliveries this IPL would have hit the stumps.
I do not know what is the average for other bowlers from other teams. But, seems like one of the key things that has stopped KXIP from getting wickets.",8
"Finally tried select Dugout. Gotta say, if Graeme Swann keeps it fun like this, I'm permanently switching over. The guy's hilarious!",8
Losing many a games have definitely lowered the KXIP's morale,6
"Can someone explain to me how a team with Shami, Mujeeb and Cottrell can be so poor at bowling that they fail to take a wicket for 35+ overs across 2 games",6
"That’s the closest they even got to a wicket.

I just realized there were barely many threatening pad hits of dropped catches",10
"Looking at their squad, KXIP look thin on player options, no matter the role.

Maxwell hasn't justified his place in the XI and they should explore replacing him. Looking at their bowling troubles, perhaps Viljoen could be an option. Although he has a tendency to get carted too. Still don't know why Ishan Porel isn't in the XI. I'd love to see him in action.

Look at it any way you want but KXIP have very little depth in their squad. It's going to be another long and frustrating tournament no matter how well Rahul and Mayank bat.",8

230 should be on the cards if they go wicketless.,10

a wicket? almost forgot what those are,3
"I am not sure if Warner is stupid or clever. There are two scenarios:

1. Warner knows that he can't go at high SR and hit boundaries too much so he converts 1s to 2s to keep his SR decent and run rate up. And when he gets tired and gets out by trying to hit out at the 15th over say he is excused or people don't criticize him too much because ""He is tired. He converted 1s to 2s, such character."". If that is the case, shouldn't he come down the order or sacked?

2. Warner is actually just trying to make most of whether runs he is offered and running as hard as he can to keep run rate up. But since he gets tired he can't hit out anymore later. If that is the case, shouldn't he just conserve energy, not run hard, and hit later?",1
Feels like Warner still isn’t back to his usual self. Hope we can play in India again next year.,1
Too tired,0

Here it goes,1
220 was a formality but the openers were so fried,1

But but was he run out ?,10
"**15.4** Ravi Bishnoi to Bairstow, OUT, **there's an lbw appeal and a run-out appeal.** The run-out's been sent upstairs. At the striker's end. But it seems they've also referred for the lbw. So we'll be looking at that first. It was a slider at leg stump, Bairstow was struck on the back leg trying to whip into the leg side. That back leg is definitely in front of leg stump, but there were a couple of sounds...**Ultra Edge shows no bat and that is hitting leg stump.** The decision will be overturned. Good review and what an over this is. Four dot balls and the two set batsmen gone. Bairstow falls short of a well-deserved hundred **160-2**

JM Bairstow lbw b Ravi Bishnoi 97 (55b 7x4 6x6) SR: 176.36",7

Always bowl your best bowler after strategic timeout should be a strategy.,4
Wow.. What difference 4 balls can make. And NGL.. I thought that was going to be a bad review looking at it live.,1
Samad got lucky. He would've been out if bairstow survived.,9

"1 run and two wickets

Gosh Bishnoi is genuinely a big hearted bowler isn't he,9
Bishnoi is a superstar,5
What an over! This is what a timeout does.,3
Are they playing Kanos as the pinch hitter down the order lmao,4
no why no Kane?,2
If only we still had Mujeeb for one more over.,1
"Any chance we'll get a replay to see if the runout would've worked, assuming bairstow was not out",2

Its *that* time of the match i guess where things happen😄✌️,2

Chahal of Punjab!,7
Was that a double wicket maiden?,2
That's a great second over from Bishnoi after going for 18 in his first,4
Warner made a mistake running and wasting all his energy instead of just slogging,-1
Can they remove fake crowd noise..they don't make sense and very annoying..louder than commentary,1
Bishnoi is to KXIP what Chahal is to RCB.,3
imagine if they dont even get 200 from here on.,3
Nitin Menon is the best umpire of all umpires. Like the bestest ever. No argument will convince me otherwise.,1
JONNY NOOOOO,1
Literally turned on when I saw they were 160-0 after 15 and this happens. Just wanted to see some fireworks.,1
Bit of an IPL noob - is the batting timeout mandatory to take? Just can't understand why they would even bother to take it and ruin their momentum if they didn't have to,3
"Damn, I was hoping it would be a wicket maiden over.",3
Bishnoi should say bye bye to KXIP for Team India's sake. They will ruin his confidence with their weird ass tactics.,3
Sunrisers doing a kings Xi and scoring under 200 somehow inexplicably,6
Kane can play rather aggressively but i feel it's common opinion that he plays slowly. Atleast Sunriser's management think so. He can accelerate faster than Pandey i (no disrespect to him),5

Happy for samad that he got a promotion because he can take srh pretty up from the current score,5
They should either bring in Porel or Viljoen for Cottrell depending on Gayle's availability. Cottrell has been good but he has never looked threatening.,6
This is going to be a classic SRH finish. Bang Bang at the top and crawling to a decent total at the end.,10
SRH won't cross 200,3
Lol it was wickets on both ends,3
Would've much rather Mujeeb have an over left in the death than Cottrell,3
How the tides turn...,1
"Anyone who has played cricket even for a small time professionally understands how BIG the effect of momentum is

The change in momentum started after Mumbai fucked us raw, Chennai and SRH continued it. 

But the hardest thing is to switch the momentum, and come back. Its why batsmen tend to go very cautious when they cant do well, trying to switch momentum into their side. 

Momentum is HUGE in cricket, we ll see more of it as KXIP restricts SRH to 190.",8

Srh is that guy who gets hard at first but cums within few strokes,11
12 balls have changed the game...,8
"Dugout talking about destructive middle orders like MI, KKR and ""CSK"" and naming Dhoni and Jadeja.",28
Arsh is like a good death bowler. Good yorkers ma man.,7
"4 runs , samad don't deny run to Kanos, run faster bc. We jeed atleast 200",2
5 runs from last 2 overs,1
I believe Kane will take them across 200,2
The pitch and outfield make  it look like it will be difficult for KXIP to score even 130 here,2
CRR is <10 would you believe it.,8
"Feels odd seeing Sardar guy bowling pace, used to see them bowl spin only",8
Orange sus,-2
Why is KL supporting SRH by wearing orange cap? /s,3
2 overs 6 runs 3 wickets. That is a great comeback,7
My boy Arshdeeeeeeep!,1
"SRH is cursed by the spirits of the old owners. It’s not a bad curse- just a frustrating one. It’s the curse of averages. The batting is exceptional at opening but so bad after that- the result is “meh”. The bowling is generally good- but when they give runs they get a few wickets else they get none and the net result is meh. The fielding is meh. The players are brilliant when viewed individually, but as a team- meh. Definitely nothing very very special about this.",5
"KXIP have pulled this back beautifully. If they continue bowling like this, they are 100% in this.",4
"Don't worry SRH, Cottrell has 1 over left",1
Nooo don't get too greedy,0
Lol Sanjay criticising SRH for releasing Hooda and Yusuf saying they gave some strong finishes to SRH in earlier seaons. Does he even watch IPL?,9
Rahul and Mayank both have potential to play an innings like Bairstow and SRH's bowling is shit barring Rashid so Game on bitches,4
Seriously we bottled the 220+ score👏,10
"Wow that was rubbish from Pooran, woefully casual",5
"Pretty lucky, samad",4
Pooran is that you?,5
With the Indian bowling line up srh should score 300 to win,3
Pooran wtf was that drop haiz...,5
IPL Fielding™,7
Thank you for drop and boundary. Samad is very lucky,4
"Pooran, come on.. that was easy.",7
Droooop,3
Pooran mate,6
SRH just aren't meant to reach 200 easily ever,8
"Props to Bishnoi and Arshdeep for bringing KXIP back into the match. If SRH can be restricted to 190, it'll get pretty interesting.",6
Lucky boi,7
"Assuming if Bairstow's lbw is not out, can they still check for run out on the other end  as they have taken a review ?",5
Scenes if one more wicket falls in next over.,5
Noooooooooooooooooooo Pooran Noooooooooooooooooooo,5
Droooop,4
IPL fielding,2
Who's keeping?,2
[deleted],7
Pooran. Man wtf,2
"Lol replay of Jadeja's drop from yesterday, that.",2
Poor Bishnoi...,2
Of all the fielders Pooran drops it . wow,7
Can’t believe he was Pooran,8
Damn didn't expect Pooran to drop that,8
"ooff, got lucky",1
Good effort from pooran,-2
behenchod Vaseline hands,4
Cmon,1
mahn i love collapses pooran whyd u have to ruin it,16
That was quite fucking Pooran from him,11
Pooran literally says on a poor run. I don’t know what folks expect.,6
Bishnoi has been such a revelation,7
"If there is 1 pair who can match the fireworks of Warner and Bairstow, its gonna be Rahul and Mayank",9
He never usually drops those,3
Kumble be like : fuck this shit,8
"Damn, Nicky P :(",4
Jonty is like naak kat di isne.,9
the way warner batted in the end has a big contribution in this collapse,8
When you realise there's no bhuvi to defend ⊙.☉,8
"SRH: *Pehle aap*

KXIP: *Nahi nahi, pehle aap*",8
Well they say catches win matches for a reason.. catching has been truly sh!t today,8
*the soul of Jonty dies inside*,11
KXIP back at it.,6
Pooranpori dropping it,2
"I mean, already 171 is a good score tbf",2
We need more young blood like Samad that is actually potent.,1
Fielding in ipl has been so casual and extremely poor,15
Bishnoi already India's second best wristspinner.,26
That drop was a poor'un,21
This dubai ground is a nightmare for fielders,5
Pooran's drop has shifted the momentum once again.,3
SRH showing solidarity with CSK,9
Lol Pooran is literally an arms length away from Jonty and Kumble lol. Talk about adding salt to the wound. Can't even look back.,6
"Samad is using all his luck in this innings, save it for the bowling boy. We need it",6
Abdul (the almost six hitter) Samad,6
"century in Dubai >>>> century in Sarjah

Sad for yjb

As for this collapse : classic srh",28
[deleted],6
Did they change the fucking ground in between the time out?,9
"Throwing spinners at the end on turning pitches is a legit strategy.

Remember Saqlain!",13
Shit!!!,2
Srh should use Abhishek Sharma better,2
Yes,1
Bishnoi 👏👏👏,8
"This is the worst fielding tournament I have ever seen, may be outside the ones that Pakistan have been involved in.",8
Bishnoi on 🔥,6
"Fk yeah Arshdeep. Also, KXIP may have accidentally found a death bowler in Bishnoi lmao",17
"Thank you Arsh, very cool",4
Bishnoi and Arshdeep doing everythinh,17
Kumble was so disappointed. :(,3
Kollapse,1
Send Rashid Khan,3
"Don't be like Hooda, Samad. We've big hopes from you.",7
Great comeback by Bishnoi,4
All out incoming,4
"Honestly, Samad really has not been impressive. He has intent but no execution at all really. Seems sloppy",5
Bishnoi is a star,2
"Ohh fuck, it should have cleared the boundary. Didn't connected it well. Anyway good on him to trying.",2
"Yep, it’s next year for us boys.",3
Why tf people post cringe selfies in hotstar. Can't even watch  the match in minimized mode coz of that shit,9
"Well done SRH, become the weak so as to be considerate",3
Bishnoi you beautyyyyy,2
Arshdeep does better than pooran.,2
KL tied the laces just a little too tight xD,2
So collapse gonna happen anyway,1
SRH's batting is literally just Warner and Bairstow(and Kane I guess),6
Send rashid ffs,3
"Pacers making up for the cluster fuck at the beginning, hope Shami chimes in as well",5
Man i love cricket and also ipl so much,4
"SRH: Our batting sucks

KIXP:  We'll help you with that

KIXP: Our death bowling sucks

SRH: Say no more",62
Bishnoi 👏,3
SRH’s bowling is one of the weakest. 195 is perfectly chaseable by KL and Mayank,-2
"This is some spectacular collapse SRH is managing, Bairstow must be shaking his head smh",7
This looked like a route that was going to be boring to watch the second half of and all of a sudden this is a great watch,3
"**17.5** Ravi Bishnoi to Abdul Samad, OUT,  **173-4**

Abdul Samad c Arshdeep Singh b Ravi Bishnoi 8 (7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 114.28",1
"Bishnoi is turning into a wicket machine. If Punjab fields well, kid can get a 5fer.",7
"Bishnoi has been so impressive,",7
Bishnoi is god for punjab.,7
So basically srh is a glorified csk at this point,13
"This team is truly Warner, Bairstow and Inshallah lmao.",34
Let's go. Keep that momentum,5
At least he was trying to be aggressive,3
Title of this thread should read: Match Thread: 22nd Match - Sunrisers Hyderabad v Bishnoi & Arshdeep,9
"It’s sucks the auction had been pushed forward a year:(

At least then we could have done some rebuilding.",15
"Garg and Williamson, very cool",3
SRH some how managed to collapse with only 3-4 overs to bat. Incredible.,7
Can we cross 180??,11
Arshdeep with the catch...magic duo today,7
Imagine Kanos getting out now.,5
[deleted],0
How did SRH turn this pitch from a batting paradise to a bowling pitch,6
Good of SRH to come forth and make this a bipartisan meme match,7
Kumble transferred all his energy to Bishnoi during the timeout.,7
Man this game is filled with twists,3
Rahul-mayank can one up bairstow-warner...No lies here,4
SRH needs a killer like Mahesh Babu in lower middle order,2
Bishnoi doing the bowler's version of the Tewatia™,7
KXIP will happily take a score below 200,6
Wickets man. Respect them. FFS. Our middle order needs to do that.,4
Give last over to Bishnoi also. They can't read his googly.,6
This is already enough though lol,2
"Wow, SRH's middle order is absolutely terrible. 

Even if openers set them up with a good start and scoring base, they'll throw their wickets. Yikes.",13
"Dropped catches suck, buuut

I mostly follow matches on cricbuzz, so the first info I have about a ball is what was scored by the batsman. So seeing ""4"" is disappointing. But then you see the catch was dropped. Yeah it's a dropped chance but and there's the initial disappointment. But At least it relieves me that the bowler seems to be getting things right, and the over might not go for much if he keeps his cool. And that seems to have happened right now as well, with Samad's wicket",8
"Bishnoi has a bad haircut at least looks like it.

But 29-3 after going for 18 in the 1st over is bonkers though .",5
Great bowling or shit batting?,3
Is the pitch good for batting?,3
Why would you send in Garg instead of Abhishek now? Garg needs some tim to bed in.,3
This is a CSK level finish with Kane playing the role of Dhoni,3
190 is still a tough af score to chase if we limit them to that. Good recovery though,4
Collapse happens: *DD and RCB Flashbacks*,4
Bro just bowl arshdeep full time and drop Sheldon,13
We're back bois. Middle order crisis.,4
Is 200 still possible? They were predicting 220 2 overs ago.,4
Arshdeep is bowling slower but nailing the lengths,3
i don't know why but i feel sad for deepdas Gupta in the mycircle11 ad,6
[deleted],2
Samad looks like Betaal from DisneyXD,5
[deleted],15
Samad can be groomed to become a huge player,4
Garg before Abhishek.. Braindead Franchise being run through recency bias.,7
Fucking funny video by Josh... I'm laughing my ass off,7
Is there any other Indian finisher other than Pandya & Pant ?,10
Man atleast take singles. FFS,7
WOW this is impressive,7
[removed],8
Lol,3
Can't blame Garg here at all,5
what a collapse wow,5
Classic SRH lmao,5
Not this time :),3
What is this match lmao,7
Who doesn't like a good collapse,7
This is pathetic,6
OMG,5
What a collapse from SRH lmaooooo. Very kool,4
Both these teams are so pathetic this year lol,6
At least reach 200 ffs,3
"This has to be staged, how does a team collapse vs KXIP in the fucking death..",2
Nic catch,4
Kollllllaapppssee,4
Jonty is like izzat bachali isne,7
Garg can only hit behind the wickets!,3
fucking hell is this,3
How old is Arshdeep?,2
inb4 SRH all out before 20 overs lmao,2
Players seem to be allergic to the crease,3
Just send in Rashid Khan.,4
Hyderabad Super Kings?,3
"**18.1** Arshdeep Singh to Garg, OUT, **Pooran takes one to his right and screams.** At long-on this time. **175-5**

PK Garg c Pooran b Arshdeep Singh 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
What. The. Fuck?!,6
Will punjab chase this tho?,3
this is some england level shit,7
Pooran you beauty,3
SRH imploding,3
Finally Preity Zinta Jumping,5
"And SRH collapsing, why i am not surprised",3
15/5 in 3.1 Wow,8
Lmao Kumble told us Bishnoi would bounce back when he got yeeted but we didn't believe him,9
Srh's middle order looking like shit.,3
"I have many users here supporting SRH with similar names - Rithik, Rithika, Ritwick, Rithwick etc. Are they the same guy or am i going crazy?",2
They will take all the wickets they missed in the last match,3
haha,2
Collapse 101 from srh,3
"Hit some 4s, take some 2s, why the fuck is everyone just holing out to a boundary fielder",5
SRH be like: middle order? what's that?,5
Lmao,4
Middle order Collapse and SRH name a more iconic duo,7
lol now I can understand why SRH fans are always reverse jinxing,5
0(1) Is better than 7(12) if u know what I mean,14
"RCB with the ball

RCB with the bat",2
Hit fours instead of sixes you cunts,4
Hahahahahahahahaha,1
Where's the dude who called 179-9?,4
"Collapse of epic proportions!!

Two youngsters for Punjab are on fire!!",2
Abhishek save us pls,1
Atleast he is out first ball,1
I still think KXIP is the more shit team even though it’s a bit close now.,1
"Is it a rule that the moment there is a Garg-Kanos partnership, the next ball has to be a wicket? HAHAAHA",2
This has to be one of the worst collapses,1
Where is Vijay Shankar?,1
"Rashid is way better finisher than this indian guys, they should experiment sending him above",2
"I really feel for Bairstow, Warner, Faf, Watson",1
Gooood catch finally,1
Finally Kanos on strike,1
KOHLAPSE,0
what chutiya batting,1
House of cards.,1
Are they gonna take 20 wickets this match?,2
Can single digit Kanos reach double digit?,2
Let's go Nicky P!,2
Wicket falling like there's no end,2
SRH needs a finisher,1
Hahahaha,1
B A T. . S H A L L O W.,2
"Do you folks sometimes ever wonder that we are a 1.35 bn country and even after 10 years of IPL and economic growth, exposure to new training techniques etc. we still cannot find a replacement for Yuvraj ?",2
Teams are starting this new trend of spin in death overs lol. Out of desperation but worked for both KKR and KXIP,3
Top shithousery from both KXIP and SRH tbh. Very very kool,3
Lmao srh tail begins at #3,7
"Idk what's more bad
SRH's middle order or K11's bowling",2
Disgusting.,2
"SRH openers ᕙ( ͡◉ ͜ ʖ ͡◉)ᕗ
SRH middle order 🤡",6
"Omg 😡 , just play single every ball and atleast put 190🙄",2
"Wow, middle order wack today, even by SRH standards",3
"In this thread -

Fans of both teams disappointed in their respective teams, for different yet similar reasons",3
"Please don't collapse now, after a very solid start ffs.",1
"This is why T20 is good format.

If this were a test match and 2 wickets fell, you would not see batsmen taking risky shots. They would defend the next 10 overs and consolidate. Nothing wrong with that but it is not good for spectators.

With T20, batsmen were taking chances and thus bowlers were in the game.

Yes, I like T20 more than tests. Downvotes to the left.",2
how the fuck are they getting out to these deliveries?,6
KX is like we don't always pick up wickets but when we do it's  free real estate,5
"I was going to ask Punjab fans to join our rubbish teams society, but seems I'll have to ask both of them",6
Unnecessary pressure on Kanos. The dude could have taken us to 200 easily. But the guys at the other end had to throw away their wickets.,3
I’ll say this here. Arshdeep has been underrated and unrecognized for too long. He’s a good prospect for KXIP and even india,1
"Would you look at that. Seniority be damned, let Bishnoi and Arshdeep who are doing well continue at the death. Wonders so far.",6
This is SRH declaring. They think it's enough for them to defend.,3
SRH plays with 2 batsmen ... crazy strategy.,5
Abhishek should have been sent before Manish,3
These kids 6 hitting ability is trash.,2
"Wow, what a turn around",3
"Manmohan Singh: The accidental PM  


Bishnoi and Arshdeep: The accidental death bowlers",8
"Ultimate troll, KXIP to win this without losing a wicket!",9
"Come on Kanos, get them to 200",1
Seems like the credit card declined in the timeout🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑,7
"I need Maxi at 3. He has a good record coming in at 3rd. If he can keep it straight for 20 deliveries, I think he can deliver a big score.",5
180-190 is a good score in Dubai.,4
Arshdeep bowling like it's a different pitch,8
[deleted],5
Wait it's all RCB?,4
"15(19) & 5 wickets, this is some next level shit from SRH",6
An easily movable object meets a surmountable force.,4
Rahul did the right thing there by giving arshdeep the over and not cotrell,5
"Last 19 balls 15 runs, 5 wickets.",5
Not surprising to see for an SRH fan as this has happened times. I am just happy that start was good enough to take us to 190. I trust in our bowling even without Bhuvi to defend this.,5
Bencho what an amazing comeback from Punjab. Bishnoi and Arshdeep absolute chads,5
at least pooran redeemed himself,3
I wonder when Williamson dusts off all this shit he is surrounded by.,3
cmon abhishek hole out,3
Someone predicted SRH all out 190,3
[I am numb now](https://imgur.com/LXNTV3N),7
So Pooran can take harder catches but not the simpler ones? Gotcha,5
Williamson can still do some damage.,3
160-0 SRH fans probably: Only half of half battle has been won,5
Williamson must take some responsibility not just take a single and push it on to youngsters.,1
Possible for both teams to lose? Sure do deserve it,6
Just imagine how SRH would've faltered if Warner or YJB had gotten out in the powerplay,8
Kane is the only one sane out there,4
Who can SRH go for in next auction?,1
"If Priyam Garg plays the next match, I can assure all the journalists that he has Laxman's nudes.",3
I really hate this lady's voice,9
"I got used to this shitshow 
You get used to it too Hyderbadis if you haven’t already",1
"I tuned in at 160-0...

Sorry guys",11
"Damn, that shot tho.",3
Finnaly,3
"So 160 for none in 15 overs to 175 for 5. 

15 runs in 3 overs for 5 wickets...",5
Came here just to say one thing... Bruh,5
Wtf what a shot from Abishek lmao. Mini helicopter,8
Shiiit that was a classy shot,5
We’ve seen some crazy chokes these past 2 days,4
That was a great shot from Abhishek,4
"I want us to collapse under 50 once to kill any sliver of hope left in my mind. Hate this teasing bullshit, we're just too shit.",3
Wtf was that shot,5
SRH is showing what would have happened if KXIP had broken the Watto-Faf partnership in their last game.,6
What a fucking flick,5
"Last 18 balls 15 runs for 5 wickets. 

Do you ball Bishnoi, or Shami for the 20th?? I'd go with Shami. Especially if Rashid if coming in next. But given how hot Bishnoi is right now. Hard to leave the hot hand.",5
Fuck shot of the IPL candidate.,4
This is called a heplichopter shot,4
Again Williamson why are you taking singles?,4
Definitely Bishnoi should bowl the 20th,7
That's a six. Thank God,6
What a shot,6
woah that looked out,6
"23% full toss, around 35% length. How isn't aarshdeep getting pummeled constantly?",9
"In last 20 balls, SRH have scored 16/5",1
"I've always felt if two batsman have settled down for almost 14-15 overs, they should be the ones to finish the regardless of the number of wickets or the quality of players to come.",8
"Umpire: let me call it six, oh wait never mind, let me check",14
Abbishek Sharma always elegant,11
I have to admit I have never even heard of this Arshdeep fellow.  He is pretty good! Is this his IPL debut?,11
Punjabi on punjabi violence,6
"Replace garg with Vijay Shankar the next match, it'll also provide an additional bowling option.",3
Despite the collapse this is still a good score.,5
That was like a lefuckyou 3,9
Need a mute Anjum chopra button on my remote.,11
"Uh, were bairstow and Warner batting on a different pitch?",5
Fuck I forgot about Rashid playing for SRH. They can easily defend this,9
"When Arshdeep gets a wicket, he seems as surprised as us.",36
What a comeback from Arshdeep. Great yorker,5
Who's the wicketkeeper for kxip?,5
Abhishek has some 6 hitting talent,13
[deleted],7
"Arshdeep just got lucky today, none of the balls where got wicket were actually there, he would have gotten smashed all over on a different day",-1
"SRH were on their way to 220+, now struggling to reach 190",6
Warner looks fucken pissed. Gonna give the youngsters a good Aussie style scolding,15
"If Bishnoi stood on a box, he'd look like Siddharth Malhotra's long lost twin..",13
Time for Mandeep to threaten Abhishek with Ranji contract /s,6
Is Rashid playing this game,3
This dude can fuck,4
I like how neither of the team's dugout is happy at this point,3
"Well done abhishek, finally",8
Pooran can't do the simplest of stuff while fielding lmao,8
Would I be incorrect in saying Anjum Chopra is female Sanjay Manjrekar.,11
Pooran was really poor after that spectacular effort.,8
Is that charl langeveldt in the srh dressing room,5
Abhishek Sharma has looked the better hitter than Samad tbh,16
"So I decided to skip SRH's batting innings because well, KXIP had no bowler I was interested in other than Shami. Now I find out they took 5 wickets in the last 4 overs. :|",10
200 would be great here,6
I'm convinced Arshdeep would get smashed around the ground at smaller venues,1
YES abhishek giving me those sweet fantasy points. Had YJB and Abhishek in my team today both seem to be delivering well,12
"SRH and KXIP are similar batting orders, top heavy.",15
This is still a great score. SRH usually like defending 160. This is very competitive,10
"Rahul deserves a better franchise and coach.  Iyer got lucky,.",24
Why did Abhishek bat so low. Dumb management.,3
"Don't let em down abhishek, take a single and take kane off the strike",13
SRH is definitely crossing 200,6
Man if Kane doesn't get into form then our middle order looks so brittle.,8
FFS promote Abhishek from next match,12
Simple for Bishnoi. 13 off the last over to defend,7
Seems like a track to play proper shots rather than slogs,16
Shit.. they going to 200 still,9
"Assdeep bowled well today despite costly last over, well done young man",9
Abhishek looks a handy player,3
Noooo why Shami?? Bishnoi was bowling like a dream,10
"Tomorrow's match is in Sharjah?

Congrats RR",14
"So, Punjab will have to score around 170 odd off 16 to win",2
My Google live score notification said SRH were 160/0 in 15 overs so I switch on the TV to watch the last 5 overs and it's 176/5?! WTF happened?,3
"If RR lose tomorrow, they’ll go from Sharjahsthan Royals to... Sthan Royals",7
For some reason Kane reminds me off Linus from LTT,7
"12 runs is a good over in the death for SRH, whereas for MI it would have been a disappointment.",7
Is this a contest of 'who can throw away a game better?',4
Not giving Shami the last one?,3
"Damn, Everyone was bashing out on kxip for bad death bowling...... They reversed it now.... Great death bowling, bad bowling overall.",17
"Wait they had an over of Shami left after that Warner Bairstow partnership!

Who the fuck is captain!!",9
Bache ko Bachao might be the silliest ad in this IPL.,11
Pragmatic decision to give the ball to Shami.,9
Shami needs to learn death bowling,3
Tip for srh game watchers. you will be bored in srh batting.But You will get fun in srh defending.,7
If kanos gets out..,8
When will Single Digit Kanos evolve?!,7
Fuck tomorrow's match is gonna be GOOOOD,9
Arshdeep is his Punjab teammate this might have helpedi him,7
OMGGGGGG RR back to Sharjah tomorrow,15
"Gosh RR vs DC is gonna be so one sided lol, but at least they're back to playing in Sharjah",12
Bishnoi was bowling so good,5
Abhishek sharma's body language feels different.,8
Ravi Bishnoi absolutely looks like Gaurav Kapoor the stand up comic and nothing can convince me otherwise.,7
Abhishek Sharma reminds me of Yuvraj.,8
Tmrw pink Bois vs ~~BC~~ DC. Hope Delhi wins,6
Bishnoi would never,9
This is why I fucking love kane,7
"Kanos gonna come back in form as well , super",5
Best bowler gets to bowl 3 overs,8
"Cmon Shami, poor bowling",4
"Should've bowled bishnoi

He's turned the game and SRH were struggling",3
Delhi Capitals vs Sharjah Royals tomorrow!!,6
Kanos  ಥ ‿ ಥ,2
[deleted],9
Could have just bowled Bishnoi,4
Single Digit Kanos has now broken the single Digit Curse.,5
Kl died there,13
Yess kanos,6
Should've given last over to Bishnoi.,10
Kane’s batting is eye sex,13
Kane never goes wrong with placement,8
Go kanos go,7
Still 200. KXIP losing this,13
Srh really need an experienced power hitter down the order,14
Come on Kanos 200 plzzz,12
Buttler and Pant at Sharjah tomorrow. Can’t wait 😍,24
Kanos ಥ ‿ ಥ,11
Daddy Kane uwu,13
That's a sixer from Kanos,7
This whole thread is ppl using hindsight bias to criticize the management lol,13
Even with the horrible collapse this score should surely be enough,4
Fuck y'all Kane haters,9
How has that gone for 6,1
"Kane"" pant ""Williamson",10
I thought he'd completely mishit that but that was 6 lmao,2
Bairstow hundred missed im sooo saddd,4
"Ohhhh fuck I thought he is gone,lmao. Go kane",8
Tomorrow we have Samsung vs Nokia,11
Pure timing that.,8
Fuck me Kanos,9
Wow,3
200 sure!!!,5
Shami is the definition of village,-4
Johnty wtf mate...your could have caught that,7
Fuck shot of the IPL winner!,5
First six for Kane after 52 balls in this IPL,3
King Kaneo should have still come in at 3,9
He's a freak definitely,8
Should've played bishnoi,6
Shami ka toh kabab bana diya,5
No Kane no gain,11
BRB rubbing one off for kanos,8
One handed 6 lmao Kanos what a chad,9
Kane going all out in the final over is so sexy,8
Abhishek > jadhav,15
"Shami baby, what is you doing",3
Elegant Kanos,6
"Kedar Jadhav, take notes.",5
"Kaney hit that six with one hand, would’ve been 12 runs if he used both hands",6
Kanos only needs one hand to finish :),7
It's weird seeing Jonty with glasses,5
First SIX for Kane Williamson in IPL2020 & that too one hand,5
Why is kane playing so down. He always gets runs,4
Cant bowl more shittier than this,3
So Shami is Samson of bowling in IPL?,7
Kane should be at 3 after this,3
Williamson is someone csk should target next season...,6
ye rubber lagaya bc,4
I still think giving it to Shami was good idea.,9
"Brilliant ball, two boundaries pls",1
KANEE,10
KL worried his hairline will resemble Shami's by the time this season is over.,21
"They are back after some good overs, this is the KXIP we know.",2
The target is 200. SRH did their job,10
Shami should just shave it all off,6
Shami idiot won't bowl to his field,5
"Again, seriously!!",6
alright maxwell!,2
If a bowler goes for less than 15 in a final over in a high scoring match it's a job well done,7
Heplichopter not working this time,7
Kane is always a class batsmen to watch,6
[removed],7
"Honestly this match tells me how good Ashwin was as a captain at KXIP.

With a bowling attack comprising of Barinder Sran and Mohit Sharma, in a year where Mayank wasn’t firing at all - he somehow managed to win like 6 straight matches.",26
How did that go for a 6?,4
*Ball just met the sweet spot of the bat*,7
200ish is still very much on for KXIP imo,3
Lmao why did he dive after catching?,2
That was a bad ball,2
Giving to shami instead of bishnoi is a bad decision.,2
Nayan sukh prapti watching Kanos bat.,3
Samad was sent ahead of both of these guys because?,2
Can Punjab win,1
Why playing half assed shots? Swing fully or try to hit four. Giving Good catching practice to kings XI,7
SRH scored 10-20  runs less than what they were supposed to score.,8
Weirdest innings ever bruh,8
"Why do they show 4s in the team color (eg: orange for SRH), but 6s in black?

ETA: in the ""timeline"" at the bottom-right I mean.",3
Is anyone here supporting the kings?,8
"**19.5** Mohammed Shami to Abhishek Sharma, OUT, **taken at deep midwicket.** Low full toss angled into leg stump from around the wicket. Looks to time that, an aerial flick. But he's taken well inside the boundary **199-6**

Abhishek Sharma c Maxwell b Mohammed Shami 12 (6b 1x4 1x6) SR: 200.00",1
Last bowl six pls williamson,2
The crowd clapping heavily for this outstanding innings,3
I still can't get how Kane's not their captain,5
Should have gone for two or four or swing fully.,1
Kanos with a 200 strike rate.,5
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Kanos. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Kanos. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",16
Maxwell is in the team literally only for his fielding,16
"At this rate, Rahul is gonna be greying before even hitting 30.",13
Finnaly the target is 202,3
"SRH was 100-0 at 10 overs, 201-6 at 20. That's surprising lmao",20
Note that this innings still makes more sense than what CSK did yesterday.,24
That is a very good score on any ground,7
Meme game so far.,9
"160-0 from the first 15

41-6 from the last 5

Good comeback from KXIP, shit finishing from SRH",8
Are we gonna see KL masterclass?,3
"Not being sexist but that Lady commentator is annoying as fck, always stating the obvious.",12
That 6 from Kanos wasn't even in the middle of the bat. And it was a slower ball which he kind of didn't pick it up.,14
Phew.. got the 200,9
"14 runs eh not so bad, SRH was looking at 220 atleast",5
"Predicted it 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j7btvx/match_thread_22nd_match_sunrisers_hyderabad_v/g83x550/",3
"Should have only been 190. But at least we got some wickets. 

Great comeback after 160/0

At least momentum is on our side",6
India has got to make their bowlers practice their power hitting. Almost every other team has bowlers that can hit - including Afghanistan,11
“At the end we were 20-30 runs short”,9
"They sent Pandey ahead of Kane, damn the disrespect.",16
"SRH should send Rashid Khan up, like KKR does with Narine",10
"Williamson is a proper team man, striking at 200 coming lower down. *Someone should be taking notes*",26
Miracle that we crossed 200 after that shithousery.,8
"Phew they got to 200, 20 runs short, but they'd have it",3
Feel satisfied. Yeah we are probably 20-30 runs short of where we would like to be but good to see 200+ on the scorecard.,8
I'm not gay,-1
[deleted],9
KXIP still have a long way to go. I don't think batting will be as easy as Bairstow made it look.,9
[removed],5
Imagine scoring only 41 against KXIP's death bowling,5
Will happily take 201. Above 200 mental barrier for chasing team.,5
Kane should have come in before Samad,6
Kanos should stay in the squad. The guy is experienced. He atleast knew he should save his wicket and go throttle later. Someone needs to stay at the other end to finish the job. You can't have everyone getting out trying to score.,17
20 off 10 for Kane. Probably faces about an extra 8 balls if he came in at 3. Missed out of an extra 10-15 runs there.,8
"Honestly I have no hope for Kings XI, but I hope they win today.",4
202 is bad for the start we got. Warner need to take a class to these cunts who shat in bed. What they were trying to pull.,9
Kanos is awesome!!,10
If Rashid has a bad day -> Punjab win,10
Inshallah openers played well.,4
"would ve taken at the beginning of the game, but yeah disappointed considering how we started off.",3
"Considering SRH is usually defending much lower targets, this is actually pretty nice!",4
Will be a tough chase but they need to carry the momentum of final 5 overs.,3
"Despite the failures in last couple of matches, this is the best middle order SRH ever had even if average age of Samad, Priyam and Abhishek is just 19. They have the right intent and I hope SRH retains at least 2 of them for the next 5 years if not all.",12
"Its too early for that but, we can legit leave Cortrell for Arshdeep and maybe play Viljeon?",3
Kanos should bat 1 down no questions asked,7
Pooran and Maxwell need massive innings.,7
SRH finishing it in SRH style..,3
"shit captaincy by Rahul, Bishnoi didn't complete his quota while Maxwell got 2 overs",5
[deleted],10
"u/RLKay although I feel Kanos didn’t hit as cleanly as he normally does, I can see why he is a necessity.

His temperament can help shift the momentum back in our favour.",5
"Good for SRH to reach 201, they have bowling to defend but KXIP have batting to chase if both openers perform",2
Pls Punjab win,1
Unpopular opinion: Kane Williamson is the best out of the fab 4. Literally carries his teams and can also captain really well.,6
201 was tied between rcb and mi,6
"Not sure how to feel about this total. SRH are definitely short and the sensationalism of the start was fully neutralized by the fall of wickets (i.e. they could've got to 200 without that insane start), but this is still difficult to chase.",8
"Ravi Bishnoi: 3-0-29-3

Arshdeep Singh: 4-0-33-2

SRH : 41 for 6 in the last 5 overs

First time in IPL2020 KXIP's conceded less than 50 & took 6 wickets in last 5 overs",8
"Bairstow

Warner

Kanos

Pandey

Garg

Samad

Abhishek",4
I am just wishing kxip win this match somehow,2
SRH batting = Warner + Bairstow + Kane + Trash,14
"Frankly, they should remove RTM option in future auctions. Let teams have a proper opponent to rebuild. Don’t paralyse them with such gimmicks.",9
"Why does our coach not send our second best batsman Williamson at no. 3 , instead use as a finisher? We could've easily got 10-15 runs extra today if not for his stupid agenda against kane",6
"Can't See No more anchoring shit , go big or go home.",5
Sunny g looking fit,2
I feel enraged that this braindead Franchise is making Kanos bat at No. 4 instead of one down and then go for his head after a couple of failures.,17
"Regardless of the outcome, Warner and YJB's innings are good signs for SRH.",6
Shit death batting except Abhishek (for the balls he played) and almighty Kanos,7
KXIP to be 135 all out.,4
90-10 srh. Scorecard pressure will catch up vs kxip.,7
"Batting order
1. Warner
2. Jb
3. Williamson
4. Abhishek
5. Garg
6.samad
7. Rashid
8. Manish pandey 

Srh got great batting line up if they out their players in order.",3
"Most consecutive 50+ scores vs an opponent in IPL:
9 David Warner vs KXIP (2015-20) *
7 David Warner vs RCB (2014-16)
5 David Warner vs CSK (2014-19)",5
"**SRH while defending 200+ target**

Won : 7

Lost : 1 (vs KXIP In 2014)",10
SRH should let Kane bat at 3. Manish is good and all but Kane is at least a two levels above him as a batsman.,10
"Okay every match I keep hearing this.

Any team with a GOOD management?",3
I am willing to bet 10 Rupees - KXIP cannot win against SRH bowling.,14
"Hmm, Kxip pulled a tewatia",5
"KP is a year older than MSD and Watto. He can easily play as well. 

Who is the oldest IPL player this year?",10
Lots of sexual tension between KP and that lady,10
"I'm happy with the middle order, it was time to hit out or get out. They did exactly that.

Only blimp was sending Pandey in. But luckily he didn't last long enough to damage the run rate. 

No complains about Samad and Abhishek today - they were supposed to take risks.",14
SRH is in the same boat as RR. Over dependant on the foreigners. Although SRH at least have a competent bowling line-up.,9
"Score would be definitely around 180-185  if it's not for the shitty field set which gave away easy 2""s.",8
Bishnoi is good. I can see him playing in Indian jersey in future,7
[Hmmm I was 60% right](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j7btvx/match_thread_22nd_match_sunrisers_hyderabad_v/g847ns0/?context=3),1
"Kxip was the anti-Rcb today,, totally shit the bed in the first fifteen. Get everything together in the last 5. Wtf is happening",8
"Could it have been 220+? Absolutely. 

But 201 should be enough to win comfortably unless KL and Mayank fire or SRH bowlers really fuck up.",8
Manish Pandey is neither special nor reliable enough to be batted ahead of Kane Williamson in ANY situation.,11
SRH middle order woes continue :(,3
As a neutral fan I want a last ball finish with kings 11 Punjab to win . This will open the tournament up and bring some much needed excitement back,11
This felt like a collapse but they still got 40 in the last 4,6
[deleted],7
"41/6 in the last 5 overs. 

I'd classify that as a collapse. So maybe 20-30 runs short of where they would've liked to be SRH. But 200 is still a great score in a big ground, with Rashid Khan in your lineup, against a team whose tail starts after they lose 4 wickets.",17
Manish Pandey showed glimpses of his old form last year but has regressed back to Tuk Tuk Pandey this year. And he's dropping catches as well.,5
"Haha remember when Pakistani cricket pundits thought Dhoni and Jadhav deliberately lost the WC game vs England?  
  
Little did they know, they were just playing their natural game.",31
[deleted],3
Fuck it. KL's gonna chase it I know,3
SRH has scored runs at 8.76 rpo and lost 22 wickets in the death overs this IPL. Statistically the worst team.,8
KL please do a 2016 VK,5
Need a Mayank 100 to make this game hot,4
KXIP gonna do what we did yesterday,5
This hostess girl seems nice man,6
Punjab gonna win. 100% confidence in Maxwell's ability to play a match winning innings.,1
The ball was skidding on coming to the bat really well in the first 10 overs and  has been slowing a bit. I reckon 200 is a difficult score to chase.,9
"People are being harsh on Garg, Samad and Abhishek. They came in when it was time to hit or get out and they did the right thing going for big shots especially with Williamson at the other end to steady the ship.

Garg looked ominous in that CSK match. Scored at 180 SR playing proper cricket shots. He can open for us in future if we are unable to retain Bairstow in auction. Samad is a good hitter and will be a great asset if his bowling gets good enough to be bowling 2 overs per match. Abhishek did well today and for me, he has the most potential among the three.",20
How much does SRH pay Bhuvi?,2
Simran Singh - Man of the match. You heard it here first.,0
"The jump Manish pandey did after pinching the ball, lmao",7
Hope Sandeep gets a 5fer today 🙏,0
We gonna get anxious KL or what ?,7
Even a half strength SRH bowling can win this for them,2
"**Sides conceding 200+ totals most times in IPL**

20 -  KXIP

17 -  RCB

12 -  DC & CSK

11 -  RR

10 -  KKR",5
[deleted],2
Looking forward to Natrajan's yorkers. He's probably the main fast bowler today.,4
KXIP have been really bad throughout the years (except couple of years in between) but because of RCB this doesn’t get talked about,3
"Needless Trivia:

Viljoen and Faf are Brother-in-laws (Viljoen is married to Faf's sister).",8
"Man, I am not having a great feeling about this match.",3
You could see before the middle order came in the openers were finding it tough... think the surface is responding to the environment so 200 is a great score,6
Bishnoi is cute ngl,1
Did they laugh at that twerk,3
"Everything about the IPL apart from the cricket is a cringe fest. Adverts, Commentatory, Virtual Guest Box.",8
Get the openers and it's done,8
Sandy sharma to break the back of this chase with 3 in the PP,4
Sandeep *Swingeshwar* Sharma is on,3
"Okay guys, is everyone ready to start missing Bhuvi?",4
Do or die innings for KXIP for this IPL.,2
"People underestimating the middle order of KXIP. mandeep, pooran, maxwell, prabhsimran. Nevermind.",5
Classic start from KXIP,2
Just saw the score and I'm shocked. Srh were 150 something in 15 overs what happened?,3
If SRH want to win they need to be exceptional at field,3
Imagine if KXIP chase this without losing a wicket.,8
Shami is quite shit at death bowling,1
Making some noodles! Anybody wants?,6
What the hell was that shot,8
"none of the bottom 6 teams want to win matches, I see",2
Oi Mayank,2
Sandeep Sharma is malnourished Jason Momoa,3
Two wickets and we are into the tail. Easy game for SRH,3
KXIP borrowed play bold from RCB? Uncharacteristic of Mayank to play that shot,0
Mayank hates inswingers,3
"How is Prabsimran Singh? Never heard of him in the domestic circuit, and his stats are not great.",2
"When are they gonna realise Gayle is not required atm, they need a bowler!",3
"Hypothetically, if this goes to a super over, who bowls for either team?",1
Agarwal was trying to hit a vertical six,3
Classy.,2
We don't know yet how Mandeep and Prabhsimran will turn out like this season. They can be in great touch for all we know like Tripathi turned out to be for KKR.,5
Just got my daily orgasm,6
"""Tough luck, you lost the match, can you explain why your run rate was slow?""

Shiiiiit this might be a long one bois,2
"Need to keep rr steady to keep chase alive, taking time often during chases has led to chasing teams losing",2
Sandeep used to be such a good bowler now he just bowls easy pies.,2
Srh has too many pie chuckers,3
We should be aiming for 55 by the end of the powerplay,2
You can never underestimate ipl captaincy. KL would probably have replaced Pooran with Gayle and not Maxwell when it's clear Pooran is the better option.,4
Ah that was a sexy inswinger.,2
"Mayank holds the distinction of being a RCB and DC reject.

That is a like a guarantee he will perform for others.",10
"Is there actually any reason why Kane shouldn't leave SRH apart from franchise loyalty? Clearly he can get a better deal in the auction (more money, more game time and possibly even a captaincy position).

or can players not leave a franchise?",2
"I remember when Sandeep Sharma used to be one of our main bowlers back in 2014, ah good days...",11
Quite interesting match ahead how SRH going to bowl death without bhuvi,7
I can't fathom what Thampi can do worse than Sandeep or Khaleel. Why not give him the rope for once? For a change?,6
If you had to choose between KXIP and RCB which would you choose?,7
Bhuvi just died randomly.,10
Lord Khaleel holds the key for KXIP.,2
Khaleel needs to step up now that Bhuvi is gone. He was a regular in India's limited over setup in 2019. This is his chance.,2
Sooner or later knuckle ball merchants were gonna get exposed,2
Does Gilly do some coaching? We could use him as a mentor,3
"Khaleel is so consistent with 4 good uns maybe a jaffer in there and then 2 absolute garbage, basement level balls.",3
Hahahaha,3
Wtf was that,3
Cursed team,2
I am sure current Murali will be helpful on these pitches.,1
Send Maxi at 3 pls,3
Brain-dead running..,5

WTF WAS THAT,3

HOLY SHIT!!,3
Wtf was that.,4
Seeing both Warner and Kane happy together is peak wholesomeness at the moment,13
What the actual fuck was that,3
Wtf was that,4
Kollapse,4
........... WHAT??!,6
Retire franchise.,2
Of all the ways to get out...,7
LETS GOOO,2

Lol KL sold his bestfriend,13
Into the tail?,4
Prabhsimran next? Interesting,3
Wtf?,3
Extremely selfish from Rahul.. sold him out..,11
That is disastrous,4
KL ensuring he holds onto the Orange cap.,14
We back boiss,8
Could have ran a 2 there,3
Sold him down the river,16
Rahul fucked him up lmao,14
WTF!,3
Time for the others to finally shine.,3
Ah KL,3
Fuck off.,6
Fyi that was Rahuls call,7
these guys are supposed to be best buddies or smth right?,7
Hope the fixers paid Rahul enough to do that,5
Ahahahha,3
Fantastic Warner. Haven't seen people committed to relationships as he is to the game,7
Wtf was that??,3
Very bad kl,2
KL better make up for that,4
Haha meme team,2
Rahul sold Mayank down the river.,11
KL doesn't want to let the orange cap go,8
This IPL has proved how selfish Rahul is. He’s just after that orange cap. His strike rate has been poor,8

KL doesn't wanna lose his India spot to Mayank lol. Only explanation.,9
"Maxi averages 14 this year with 93 SR.

Oof tight,1
Yay wicket wicket wicket. Big wicket for us. Now we need Rahul's wicket,3
Is this guy Prabhsimran good? I've never heard of him before,3
Prabhsimran singh? After Mandy gave you a good start last time?,3
That was a great ball!,1

How will Rahul play his Thala role now ??,6
Rahul should have sacrificed his own wicket!,4
I'm absolutely certain about the 3+2 things. But not so sure about that 1 out of 3 rule.,1

SRH look like thoroughbreds out there... Not wanting to be racist but they really do,1
"Damn, these bois can roll",3

Lmao KL does it again,3
Why are all of Bairstow's expression so extreme lol,12
Thank God!,6

Is anybody surprised that the team with former RCB memebers is languishing at the bottom?,12
KXIP lost when KL got Mayank run out. There's no other way they are winning it.,6
"KL is like the classmate you know is supremely talented and good at what he does but you also envy him because of perfect family upbringing, all opportunities he got in childhood and you know that despite his public persona he is quite arrogant inside.",15
Hope to see a good performance from simran here,3
What’s with agent Bairstow & his runouts?,6
"‘Drama after drama, here’s Sandeep Sharma’",5
Bairstow is amazing 😍😍,1
I think Bairstow caught it because he was already running. He could not stop because of momentum.,2
[deleted],3
Waiting for Rahul's 50 ball 60 after running out the best batsman in the team and wasting the powerplay,9
YJB is an absolute rare unit,4
KXIP looks rattled,4
Fun fact: Bairstow isn't even wearing a cap right now. That's just his hair,11
This is better running,3
KL Rahul wants to consolidate on his orange cap and runs out Mayank,4
Looks like it would have been a direct hit...,3
Lol Mayank was the only one who could have done it,3
Jesus this sky sports stream is so laggy,2
Prabhsimran was bought for big money in 2019 auction for some hard hitting abilities top of the order in youth cricket. He failed miserably in one match he played last season. They must have seen some potential in him to retain him and play in the xi. maybe to maximize powerplay.,5
Bhai tuk tuk chod ke kuch sixes mar lo..,0
Bairstow just looked inside our souls through the camera,1
200 to chase and sending a debutant,2
Bairstow made the game more interesting by messing up direct hit.,3
KL probably sleeps with the orange cap on.,10
Tuk tuk rahul,2
"U guys can never guess who has the Best Bowling avg. and Best SR for SRH this season.

It's >!3D man VJ Shankar with one glorious wicket!<",6
"Me: I want a RCB 

Mom: we already have rcb at ground.

Rcb at ground: ...",4
RCB should do what SRH did. Kohli and AB to open. Draw chits for the rest of the batting order.,8
KL is gonna shit the bed now with a 90 strike rate,4
"Hope another team picks up Mayank, my boi doesn't deserve this",7
Kl to Mayank- Why are you ronning? Why are you ronning?!?!,9
Gayle should open with Mayank. Reduces the possibility of getting run out running for a second,11
Me complaining about the education system and my college giving more than required stress. Also me wasting my time on IPL,8
"Honestly, forgetting Maxwell's abject form for a moment, surely Punjab would be better off with Pooran and Maxwell coming in at the 10th over with 100 left, rather than, say, in the 14th over with 95 needed off 6? 

Rahul playing anchor is not a problem, but the problem is that he does that and fails to give the final flourish. You can't play at 120 for 14 overs and then get out; that's detrimental to the side. KL needs to be more aggressive today, KXIP'S middle order is better than most sides.",5
"Honestly this is piss poor management, Maxwell seems next in line

Mandeep should've been sent but Rahul might have run him out too",9
"I know it's a bit late, but Manish Pandey looks like he is bored with his own batting",9
Sandeep’s bowling action lacks rhythm. It’s that feeling there is something off,2
"I don't blame KL for playing slow when the middle order comprises of Mandeep, Pooran and Maxwell. The run out was totally on him though",10
Rahul has been fucking tragic this entire season bar vs RCB. Don't let the fake orange cap fool you,9
"Warner is the greatest IPL player ever, agreed?",12
" Chad KL runs out nice guy Mayank. Mayank loses twice, once he loses the wicket and then he loses the girls who are ashamed.",7
PrabhSimran Hetmyer,5
Samad fielding with 1 hand everytime is a bit risky,3
KL so obsessed with his orange cap that he gave up wicket keeping to show off his cap,15
The KL in Kl Rahul stands for MS Dhoni,5
"Orange Cap ka chakkar Babu Bhaiya, Orange Cap ka chakkar!!",4
Surely Prabhsimran has been sent as a pinch hitter? Doesn't make sense any other way,8
Haha. That dugout session was fun.,6
Bairstow inspired by Pant! continuously chirping away,3
Come on simran prove all these guys wrong boi.,3
Why did we not send Mandeep ahead of Prabhsimran man we need one player to accelerate not both to play anchor,4
Nattu is love,5
Thala Rahul in peak form today,4
NATUUUU,3
"The pic of the KXIP dugout says a lot about the team ,needs a lot of changes",8
I love the dugout,12
How much of the body is acceptable for effecting run out? I thought you could only use the hands,7
"The only way you chase a 200+ score is going beserk in powerplay, maybe KXIP didn't get this memo..",5
Natarajan being paid only 40 lacks is a crime this season,13
"Why is ""more game per game""",5
Natrajan has a horribly neckbeard,6
I love select dugout. I frankly tolerate some of these games just to watch the dugout,4
"KL 'MS ""Slowni"" Dhoni' Rahul",1
If Nattu boy makes it to an Indian team it would be an amazing story. I hope he does.,3
"Fahad on cricinfo
""Rahul and Simran together. May the love bloom""",8
SRH has always been a reliable bowling side.,8
Natarajan broke his razor in the middle of shaving.,8
"Kl and warner are suffering from same problem for the past two seasons, they take just too many balls and fail to provide a finishing touch",0
Why tf do u send a 20 year old during a 202 chase ?,5
Natarajan runs so fast that the part of beard from his face just blew away,6
"I never thought I would say this, but open with Mayank & Gayle. KL at #3. Drop Maxwell if he doesn't perform today.",3
how did we lose to LXIP?,2
KXIP are chopping and changing too much. So if they drop Maxwell and bring Gayle in. What happens if Gayle doesn't perform?,3
SRH have been phenomenal in the fielding department so far!,3
[deleted],5
Was that pant,1
"This is the type of chase where Gayle is pretty much a bonus trump card.

If it works - you're pretty much ensured of a victory, if it doesn't - it's just a wicket you've lost",6
"Who decides the order in which batsmen are sent in during the game? If the captain is batting, is it decided among the rest of the players or..?",3
"From the next match, K Jadhav can appear in the virtual guest box and show us his moves for getting 7+ crores",11
Wow Kings suck. Both of them,7
"Kl""s not even half as confident as Mayank.",14
Oo yeah,2
Wasn't simran singh Irish?,1
"This new Kid is gonna blow us out of the water, isn't he?",3
Taking no advantage of the powerplay smh,3
"Prabhsimran striking the ball well, even before the boundary",5
Ooohkay Simran let’s see whatchu got,4
[deleted],5
Nice stroke simran,6
Mayank would have chased it :(,3
someone pointed out at cricinfo that Rahul and simran are together in the middle. Absolute scenes if there was a youngster named Kuljeet in kings' squad and was left out. Lmao,18
Short arm jab has become mainstream these days.,3
This prabhsimran fellow looks like a pocket rocket.,6
Poor Mayank,4
Prabhsimran has already surpassed Karun Nair,8
Rahul secretly thanking Warner for ensuring his orange cap stays safe,13
Slater doesn’t have orange cap in his team,2
"Mayank always so happy, that’s why I love him",12
"Okay none of my business, but Nattu needs to shave off that neckbeard",10
"No one can snatch away Orange Cap from KL Rahul!
No one! Not even Mayank Agarwal.",11
KL doing a thala from start,4
"Single after boundary, Sunny G - get him in India squad",8
Only 27-1 after 4 chasing 200 😂😂,3
Love the Aussie commentators thick voice.,1
Rashid to bowl. F,2
Can I get the video of runout ?,2
Rahul self-destructing when he sees other people wearing orange caps,5
Lmao krunal?,0
Too early to call KL a stat padder? /s,2
"It's high time maxwell gets a big one now. 
It's the 4th time I've picked him in my fantasy league team",2
Khaleel KITCHA SUDEEPA Ahmed,2
People itk say Prabh is a huge hitter. Its only his first game but it ll be interesting to see how it pans out.,6
kls strike rate is better this year than last year apparently,3
Jaa Simran jee le apni Zindagi,5
"KL Rahul running out Mayank to keep his orange cap, 5D chess",8
"The evolution of Mayank Agarwal is not highlighted enough. Dude really worked hard on his batting, hope he doesn't forget it in the Tests. I wonder if Prithvi Shaw will be opening as well.",7
He couldn't wait for KL to start,2
"Does anybody know the Sidemen? If yes, do yall think that Jonny Bairstow looks like Ethan Payne?",1
No you can't do that,1
Sandy had to be there to snag one.,1
"Ja simran le le run, man he's shots are fantastic",3
Why did they switch from Rashid to Khaleel?,2
I thought the ball pitched,2
KL even beats Thala Dhoni. Has powerplay + brand new ball to face and yet goes tuk tuk. Eventually ends up with 65 of 55 balls and blame goes on other batsmen. Today he goes a step further and runs out one player who could have won them the game.,4
"I had no idea that a keeper can knock stumps with his elbow too, to run out a batsman. my life's been a lie",10
Fuck yeahhhh,3
GET IN KHALEELI,6
Wtf,3
Unlucky .. cracking shot straight to hand.. good intent though.,8
"That's a good catch

He absolutely smoked that shot",7
He has looked good in his short stay,4
That went like a fucking rocket,3
Khaleel amongst wickets! Well it's 2020,3
Shit ball good shot great catch,5
Hard luck simmo,2
Jaa Simran jaa 😔💔,3
That was rocket speed,2
Well Simran is going without Rahul!,9
Khaleel has a knack of bowling shit and taking wickets,6
Best shot to get out..,6
Whatta shot Jesus and whatta catch gargy boii,5
"Brilliant shot, Brilliant catch",3
holy sun of a gun what the hell was that catch,4
So Unlucky,2
Mark Nicholas gets paid solely through a commission on the number of empty platitudes.,0
Commentators jinxed it.,2
"Man can't see Rahul so dejected and frustrated. Take captaincy away from him. Took him a lot of time to gain his self confidence, I just hope he doesn't end up low on confidence by the time IPL ends.",8
"Fuck man, that was 4, shit he was looking so good",5
"Just a random tifu story:

i was working at a restaurant in Canada and there was a guy working with me - Lovepreet. Pretty chill guy, showed me around and stuff but few months down, he had to shift cities. Fast forward 2 months, my boss calls me and tell me there's a new person joining the kitchen lovepreet and asked me to show them around. Now, I thought why didn't he just tell me lovepreet is rejoining, and what the fuck should i show him, he already knows his stuff alright eh.

So next Monday, that person comes and i ask my boss where is lovepreet? is he here yet? He tells me, yes lovepreet's in the kitchen, i go and i don't see him. and oh fuck, i go back to my boss and tell him, i don't see him. He's quite confused because i was referring to lovepreet as ""HE/HIM"", he stops me and tells me this is different person and it's a she. 

tldr - guys and guys in punjab have similar names, just got reminded of a fuckup i did when I saw the name Simran",8
I want to see more of Prabhsimran,3
Great catch but have to say the youngsters are doing rather well today for KXIP,5
Ah fak I feel bad for him :(,2
Unlucky. Was hit so good,2
INTENT ^TM,2
Damn Khaleel gave up on his weird ass celebrations huh,7
Natarajan was forced to tonk everything because he was fighting a lone battle. Another sacrificial lamb.,2
F for KXIP,4
"Best send Maxwell now. If he's gonna eat deliveries, better do it early",5
"Khaleel ""shit gets wickets"" Ahmed at it again",6
"Just when it was looking like “jaa Simran jaa, jee le apni zindagi”

T: just when he was starting to fly!",5
Id rather have prabhsimran than Sarfaraz from what we have seen so far,10
"I'm happy with the way Prabh has played , at least try to hit KL is looking worse with every match that goes by0",4
Rahul and simran separated,10
"Bad ball
Good shot
Excelled catch",13
Khaleel is so bad..still he somehow manages to get wickets..,15
"**4.2** Ahmed to Simran Singh, OUT, **oh he's crunched that straight to cover!** **31-2**

P Simran Singh c Garg b Ahmed 11 (8b 2x4 0x6) SR: 137.50",2
Simran should be given more chances.,5
Looks like Khaleel got on the train instead of Simran.,6
Just realise.. KXIP had 5 different No.3s in 6 games & he is gone too,8
"What's seriously wrong with KL, always pressuring the other batsman to hit it. This thala's deal ain't gonna help him and his team at any cost. He needs to know about his strengths",10
Why is pooran in at 4 overs gone?!,3
SRH gonna strangle KXIP ruthlessly unless they find a white knight to save them from the jaws of SRH bowling and Fielding.,4
"Jaa simran jaa, dream11 p tu bhi team bna",9
Maxwell ffs send in Maxwell,3
Pooran will score  quickly,2
Pooran needs the innings of his life. 70 or 80's score today.,6
Hmmm still no Mandeep,4
Bad luck Prabhsimran.. Khaleel celebrates like that dismissal was his masterplan all along,14
Fielding has played a bigger part than bowling in the wickets so far.,4
CARESSED,2
"India should be Bishnoi for the Australian white ball series. Off spinners are useless in Australia, unless you're Nathan Lyon.",7
Priyam has been one of the best fielders this IPL.,7
Who wins in a race? Chad Ball or Virgin Kanos?,4
2 slips..lmao.. you ain't no Zaheer Khan Mr. Khaleel..,14
"Pooran 141\*(61), KL 34\*(42)",15
I like the look and balance of this playing XI by KXIP (except Maxwell who needs to earn his spot) - they just need to keep backing them,6
Yes pooran,1
Feeling good? Khaleel: Yaar yeh mat karo ab,4
Two slips for khaleel. Lmao,3
The legendary Pahul Gill might be on suicide watch.,5
Why do I have a feeling that kxip will be defeated but those legends will still have positive nrr somehow,3
Feeling good for getting whacked and getting the wicket as a fluke bc?,4
Remember when we selected Khaleel because we needed a left armer!,4
He Is in good touch,3
Wicket alert,3
Khaleak,3
In for a Nicky P special today?,12
"Khaleel with the dolly, that brother needs a strategy coach",8
"Good catch, great placement",2
"Hopefully we will see more of Prabhsimran, Arshdeep, Bishnoi",9
"Baabuji: Ja Simran ja.. Jee le apni zindagi

Simran: Out ho gaya hu :(

Baabuji: Dream11 pe team bana le BSDK!",25
"If KL plays like this for whole tournament, KXIP management is not gonna retain him. They might retain Mayank, Pooran, Shami instead?",1
Rahul and Siman got separated. Not the kind of storyline which KXIP fans wanted.,16
PrabhSimran reaction belongs to “watch people die inside”,8
What just happened there,8
How Khaleel Ahmed gets wickets is beyond my understanding,7
Lmao! What was that graphics.. xD,14
Khaleel celebrating Singh's wicket as if it wasn't bad luck on that shot to be directly into the hands,11
That looked like Yuvraj Singh shot,1
KL playing a classic Captain's innings,4
Make Pooran the designated #3,7
What happened to 51(14) RAhUl,3
WTF was that,6
"I feel like both KL and Warner are in similar situations, in many games they hold back and play an anchor role instead of their usual attacking game.",18
Khaleel Starc Ahmed,3
[deleted],2
Punjab and Chennai 8&7 respectively this ipl FML 😩,12
"Speaking about Khaleel's celebrations, there was a time during his India A tenure (i think), when he used to just shout his name after every wicket, like ""KHALEEL AHMED!!!!!""",24

"Mayank is the heart of this batting line-up not KL, fight me",13
"Why is Gayle being totally ignored? 

He could've even replaced Cottrell(who has been shit anyway) with Porel getting a chance too.",6
"Wow kings XI is dependent on top two, just like some other team in 2019",7
"Man kxip has such nice young prospering talents, i am very happy that they might play for india some day",7
"While Dhoni is just past his prime  , KL is just plain selfish. He has the game but zero intent.",13
“Expo 2020” can fuck off if they can’t even organise it in 2020.,16
We literally have 2 more batsmen lmao,11
Just in case any punjab fans aren't dead inside enough already- Maxwell has averaged more than 20 in only 2 IPL seasons out of 8.,32
"Guys, have you ever seen KL performing in pressure situation match? He's too nervous.",10
Last over of PP atleast get 10 ffs,8
KL 11(14),6
What's kl's master plan here?,1
11 off 14 balls.. what a captain's knock so far..,6
[deleted],-1
Kl is soo shot when it comes to chasing.,-1
Rahul Thala,4
Why did they send mandeep at 3 in last match? Why did they change this game? Management totally fkd up,2
KL has been taking notes while watching SKY and Tripathi batting. Good to see he doesn't mind learning from uncapped players.,4
"Bishnoi strike rate of 20, wtf?",8
Sandeep as far as I am concerned is pretty much just a power play bowler. Interested to see how they implement his other two over later on,7
"The fact that our brightest bowler got injured and we are still somehow floating with Natarajan is all because of Tom Moody's foresight.

We still have Basil Thami in stock..",4
Looks like  Prabhsimran is the cousin of Anmolpreet who is right now in Mumbai Camp. Hopefully he too will get a game soon!,7
Partnership PARTNERSHIP paRtnErshIp,6
"KL Rahul scores at the end of the powerplay in this IPL

vs DC 21 (19)

vs RCB 23 (18)

vs RR 26 (18)

Vs MI 14 (14)

vs CSK 24 (21)

Today 11 (14) in 5.2 overs 

In only ones of these games (RCB) he ""made up"" and converted, all the other games (including Sharjah) he had a SR below 130.

There is no excuse. If you're not gonna trust Pooran, Maxwell, Sarfaraz, Mandeep, Neesham etc then what's the fucking point? 

KL has been putting the middle order under enormous pressure every game by not utilizing the powerplay. In the end he looks good because he ends the game as the highest run scorer. Not fair at all.",9
Fucking amazing,2
Prabhsimran is might have gotten out but he did play some clean shots.,3
Kohli then and now Rahul both taking inspiration from thala regarding chasing,-2
Akshdeep sitting topless there 🔥🔥,2
Pooran is just Rahul without beard Lmao,7
Learn from pooran rahul sir,1
"Nicky P is orgasmic when he hits the ball, so effortless",4
"r/cricket stop shitting on Rahul so much 
He said he was afraid that might forget to bat after doing nought in the lockdown, he'll get there eventually. Plus he scores good looking runs, gotta give him a discount for that. Not a good captain tho",10
Has anyone made a Pooran poli comment yet,7
"Man nice shot, hoping for a pooran special tonight",1
KL Rahul is going to be first wooden spoon orange cap winner?,1
These two need to stay in the middle for atleast 10 overs for Kings to make it home,2
"Am scared, pooran can easily hit boundaries. Very dangerous",5
"Ay, we're being Pooran back to form and reaping the debt of KXIP for doing the same to YJB.",7
"Same thing is happening to Rahul what has happened to Finch in ODIs. Ability to go much faster but in order to conserve their wicket, going painfully slow",11
Punjab have a Great Batting lineup tho. Only bettered by Mumbai,6
The fact that despite both his legs getting fractured Pooran made a comeback and that too continuing his wicket keeping is no easy feat. He deserves all the respect.,38
Ghosh the Commentary been so bad this year. Peak IPL,9
"4/5 innings, KL has a SR of < 130. 2 of those 4 innings he faced more than 50 balls.",5
KL waiting for Kohli to join SRH and drop a catch before he starts hitting.,3
"Pooran keep your cool, after a big six you lose your cool. Keep it calm",10
"Bowls a full toss.


Telugu commentary : Manchi comeback.",17
Who is the Indian commentator? Or commentator with Indian accent?,5
"Remember, there are still 4 Rashid overs as well",16
Bruh.....at least hit full toss for boundary.,2
95(35) Maxwell today or 17(13),3
KL Rahul is exactly like Sachin Tendulkar in that he is a right handed batsman and captaincy isn't working out for him,5
Murlidharan talking so excitedly to laxman while he seems so disinterested,2
13(15 ) not a single boundary in the power play from Rahul,2
"We all know KL is naturally aggressive batsman. The problem is that all other batsmen are very hit or miss. He has to play anchor, else a collapse will ensue",0
Were they really gonna drop pooran for Gayle? Why not drop Cortell instead? Pooran is your only good batter who can play under pressure.,4
It seems KL can only fire if he somehow gets to the end of the innings(demonstrated in the RCB match because he was dropped twice by Koach),5
How exactly is strike rate calculated,4
I'm appaled. Rahul not showing intent in the Powerplay knowing very well that Rashid is yet to bowl. Man he better take the side to a win today else I'll be fucking fuming.,3
If kings 11 bat 20 overs and are 5-6 down they ll win this,1
Khan going to be a rash all over this Kale & Pooran.,1
hope gayle gets the next game if glenpreet doesn't turn up today.,2
Is Rahul even the best Rahul this tournament?,5
"Commentators nowadays be like - ""KL is really playing a masterclass here, one of the best innings I've seen while chasing"".",7
Pooran will feast on young Abhishek,9
Its amazing how NONE of our bowlers can bat lmao,1
Changed to dugout. You can’t digest KP after a certain moment.,6
Send Max before Mandy,1
"KXIP is the new RCB.
KL Rahul is the new Virat.
Mayank is the new ABD.",5

That's why you don't bowl left arm orthodox to left handers lmao,2

Pooran is covering up kl's test innings,1
Pooran you majestic beauty,3
"Pooran needs to be playing test cricket, just on pure ability.",6
Everyone shitting on KL Rahul cause he’s 11(15) lmao. Peak r/cricket fickle fans as usual,3
Pooran: I will fucking do it again,3
"Would have been a good game if SRH didn't have Rashid. With Rashid in the opposition, you're basically chasing the target minus 20 runs in 16 overs. So basically 180 in 16 overs and that if he doesn't pick up a wicket. Very difficult",3
It's time to kaanaa the nicholas pooran again,2
This is where DC missed the trick. Attack Abhishek not Rashid!,9
Who's the other commentator with Pommie and KP?,3
Rahul just can't play the role of an anchor. He should look to attack upfront while Mayank should play the role of an accumulator.,3
Y do u give to left armer when pooran is batting?,3
11(15) is simply unacceptable in T20. Fuck anchoring. This isn't even that. Anchoring in T20 could be done at 120S/R.,14

"Oh no kl, but you bringed it upon yourself",3
KL needs to be dropped as captain he hasn't taken it well,2
I've never seen KL applying power in any shot. What's wrong? He Lazy?,6
What are the predictions for Maxwell's innings today? 10(4) or 11(8) or 12(16)?,4
Send in Mandeep and we can win this with him and Pooran,2
"I mean...he still has that orange hat, right?",3
Weird that I’m actually relieved Rahul got out?,5
"KL seems mentally out of it, nobody I want to do well, seems to be getting there",4
Statpadder gone. Punjab might actually win this now.,2
"Mandeep batted well in the last game

But Maxwell comes out",3
One thing clear.  Not to consider Rahul for India's captainship groom Iyer/ gill,2
Karnataka XI failing. GJ-KL,3
KL Thala,3
Wow KP the clairvoyant!,3
And confirmed that r/cricket is gonna shit on rahul tonight,4
"You may call this a KL choke. Ohh boy, I hope he learns to fight off the demons. Not looking good from an Indian POV.",5
KL Rahul can’t even support Pooran!,4
wanna see a maxi special tonight,3
"Lol, they have 3 more overs left of part-time bowling. Should have been sensible instead of trying to get everything done this over.",6
What a contribution KL...got your partner run out and then scored at a strike rate of 65 while chasing 200. Well done...you made Thala proud today.,8
Maxwell has balls to play now let's see what he does,2
"Now or Never Maxwell.

The time is now!",1
"Well, Maxwell this is a great time to get back ur form. Prob ur last opportunity.",6
"You beauty, warner an underrated cap 
All the bs about being the bull, reverend, monk he's a straight up aussie tiger shark. A pygmy one mind you.",2
Salman's Pepsi joke is probably PEAK IPL ADVERT,2
Sigh. Innings on Maxwell and Pooran now. All the pressure.,1
Goodbye KLPD,2
"**6.4** Abhishek Sharma to Rahul, OUT, **taken at deep backward square!** Good length, tossed up slow at middle stump. Rahul looks for the sweep and gets a top edge that is quite easily pouched by Williamson **58-3**

KL Rahul c Williamson b Abhishek Sharma 11 (16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 68.75",1
INB4 a maxwell innings that will guarantee him his spot for the next 5 years,5
This innings is equivalent to K Jadhav's innings in every way. But he won't receive nearly enough criticism,0
And he hits when he shouldn't have . There were already two sixes hit in the over,1
Unfortunately every night is not Rahul's night(PS: KKR),3
That's the tournament for Punjab..don't see how they can make it to the playoffs,4
KL Rahul mentally struggling to play his role after string of losses here we go again.,6
I'm calling it.. Maxi's gonna score 50+ today.,4
KL has wasted every powerplay he has played yet.,4
Waiting for Csk vs Rcb,7
KL paces his innings like 2012-13 Rohit but fails to blast at the end.,8
Everything went wrong for KL today it seems,11
Maxi redemption arc 🤗 Go on Maxi. Score a 100.,13
"Weelll, it's the big show!",5
Mandeep: Am i a joke to you?,11
Need to get Nicky. He's a good player,8
I love how they're talking about a partnership as if pooran hadn't scored 25 out the 27 runs,23
"Immature from KL. 2 sixes in the over, no need to hit",12
The run rate is good. KX1P are still in game.,3
"Pooran to KL Rahul: 

Tu ja yaha se, ye scheme tere liye hai hi nahi",7
This is the same mindset KL that got himself dropped from the test team,12
Genuine edge there,5
Maxi v rashid would be interesting,5
Which version of maxi tonight,3
"Every team has it's own Dhoni , it's a shame they don't have Jadhav",8
*cooler abhi*,3
Someone will have to pull a Tewatia for KXIP today. Looks very tough atm,6
"KL Rahul: 11 (16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 68.75, chasing 200.

CSK: Licking lips, once he is past 35, we want him in our team.",9
[deleted],8
"Hope these two hard hitters don't give up and entertain us, but I think the match is a gonzo.",9
Give this srh team 160+ to defend and they are absolutely in their element,7
Time for Maxi to score 1 good inning of the season.,11
I just want to watch and admire the length and girth of Pooran's big dick sixes.,9
YRKFA into the attack,4
"Even if kxip lose, I want Maxwell to settle in and get some form, it's been long since I've seen him fire in ipl",10
"Rashid Anna, pooran is hitting everyone. Take his wicket.",4
Rashid rashid Rashid Rashid rashid,4
"Three wickets down, we're into the tail now lads...",6
Match over guys.,7
3 down and Rashid to come lmao,5
Remember when KANOS was SRH captain - every fuck bowling change used to bring in wickets...,9
Star Sports have appointed fresh outta college interns in charge of the camera and graphics.,5
"When you have already got 13 runs in first 3 balls of the over, why try another hit?

KL is looking increasingly frazzled as the tournament goes on.",9
Just survive Rashid plis ಥ‿ಥ,3
"Unpopular opinion: Natarajan, Sandeep, Khalil, have been doing a decent job",5
"If punjab lose this, surely they are out of the tournament unless if they win all their remaining games?",1
Is it going to be the big show or the tepid show tonight?,1
"Who do we think for the playoffs? I think MI, DC, KKR, RCB/SRH",2
I think that Mayank run-out made it clear who has the better opening pair.,3
leg spinner to left hander bad idea.,2
KXIP can't survive 4 overs of Rashid,5
Last wicket. Game over,2
Incoming 10(15) from Maxi or 50(20) ?,2
KL looked well set for a 55 ball 70,5
rashid bowling in the last 4?,2
"Rashid is trying to talk with maxi, but he is not interested:(",2
"Max, that is a not a stance you hold in the 8th over. That's a 16th over stance",1
"Maxi has enough time to settle and blast later, no excuse today",3
This is the problem of having a team which keeps losing from the beginning.   Kings XI will now drag the tournament and we haven't even reached the halfway stage.,2
Slip to Pooran pls.,6
I am sensing a Maxwell special here (which i am expecting it for a long time),5
I never quite know what to make of KL Rahul,5
I really want someone to go after Rashid. I'm sick of him getting 4-0-20-1 every match. Ruin his economy or give him wickets guys,4
Maxi is a specialist fielder,8
Slip laga lo,4
"Well, this match has been reverse KXIP so far. 

Bowled like shit for majority of the match except the death

Now top order failed

On our way for Maxwell Pooran and Mandeep to fire and get the job done :)",7
Should keep a slip imo.,2
When are they retiring KXIP franchise? Is there a ceremony?,13
Wow the commentary is pure shit.,8
Good chance for Maxwell to settle in and play a match winning knock.,3
Slip for Pooran please.,5
Just play out Rashid man and wait for the fifth bowler to attack,8
Why in the world would you slog rashid?,4
Maxii ain't gonna do anything I know,3
Just👏play👏your👏usual👏game,1
"Oh after Rahul got out cheaply, our nattu is wearing Orange cap. Looks good on him tbh. /s",4
"Trying to hit rashid out da park, bold move",6
"Maxwell is yet to cross 15 in match? That seems unbelievable, I've seen him bat for so long already.",4
Solid defence,3
KP absolutely no-selling pooran by asking maxi to get on strike,6
[deleted],-4
maxis stance looks like he'll be out next ball.,5
"Come on Maxi, play like you have been playing",3
"KP: ""mac ....muc .. Maci.. I  am sorry Maxwell is on Strike""

Lmao",5
KP wankfest about Maxwell. Just stop it. OH GOD,6
"I generally hate complaining about commentators but why the hell are these guys living in 2014 praising maxwell, Dhoni et al",8
Max channeling his inner Jadhav with that solid defence,6
"Punjab really want to get something from their 10 crores they spent on Maxi, no other reason to include him in the team after such horrible performances and out of form",12
Kedar Jadhav would be proud of that block,8
KP is a brainless commentator.. Dismissing Pooran and bigging up Maxwell when Pooran has been playing much better than him throughout,8
Rashid is so good it should be illegal.,10
Maxwell staying in the crease till the ball leaves the bowler's hand. Could start an academy for a lot of players.,4
"Maxwell hasn't performed in ipl for so many years , still opposing team is feeling nervous bowling to him Lol",6
All you have to do is give the strike to the left handed West Indian. History suggests it works most of the time,4
Kings-XI tail is quite **longggggg**...,3
"Great over Rashid, keep pressure on. Abhishek give single to pooran",2
How the fuck Rashid gives so less runs,7
Maxwell eating balls like Rohit eats vada pav,2
"Yeah 2 sixes were already hit in that over Rahul shouldn't have done it blah blah blah .



Hindsight is always 20/20. KL was going slow, he wanted to accelerate and Abhishek was the best guy to take on because he was already hit for 2 hence a bit low on confidence and more likely to make a mistake. Rashid was about to come, can you risk Rahul take a chance on Rashid when he is already going on a <100 SR?",5
At least KXIP players used to get slapped earlier to keep things interesting.,4
"Cmon maxi, pull off a maxi and help us win!",1
Maxwell clearly watched last night's CSK v RR. Jadhav.,8
So we're done for this year.,4
"Idk which team is worse, us or kxip",2
Does anyone know the name of the hostess who was with KP earlier,2
who got a gun to dravid's head?,1
Again a gamble to bowl Sam.,2
"Attack Samad now, please",3
I'm expecting a wicket now from Samad,2
Maxwell is King's Jadhav. Keeps getting selected despite contributing nothing.,1
Pooran gives no fucks,2
"I finally support Kohli's decision to sack Kumble. Not that India have had great wins ever since, but at least with Ravi Shastri they at least they have some fun.",2
Maxi should be made csk captain. Afterall he's the maaplai.,2
Pooran akela match jeetaega,1
Maxwell in ipl is still really living on his 2014 performance,2
Hear that maxwell? This leg spinner not the other one,3
"11 off 16 chasing 200 is terrible in any match, but 11 off 16 inside the powerplay chasing 200 in 6 overs against Sandeep Sharma and Khaleel knowing Rashid has 4 overs left makes KL Rahul's knock today the worst knock by an opener in IPL 2020 imo. Yes, even worse than every Murali Vijay knock.",7
Don’t think this is a good bowling change,2
They should bring in shankar. Need a stronger bowling option,3
Damn bro Pooran is so good,2
Oh BC he is smacking every bowler. It's gone looooong way,3
Ohhh Yeahhhh dadddyyy Pooran!!,1
KP probably having orgasm by just seeing Maxwell with the bat,2
"Samad is 6th bowler, they'll target him",3
Pooran hitting them big,3
Absolute village cricket Stance by Maxwell,5
Pooran doesn't deserve to be in this team,6
Pooran is doing a maxwell here,2
Pooran has not been told they need to be shit or you get dropped!,2
Pooran you are a mythical legend,3
No spin in this wicket,4
Is it just me or is johnty looking like Willem Dafoe,3
I smell a disastrous over,8
How can multiple teams bid for Aaron Finch and Maxwell and not give a single bid for Evin Lewis who is equally destructive like Pooran and Hetmyer. I don't get it.,3
Came here to say Fuck you KL,7
"If Maxwell wins this, he's entitled to all the money that he has ever ~~looted~~ taken from the ipl",9
"I thought samad gonna hit like this when he came to bat, but he is conceding like this. Fuck",6
"Really clean hitting from Pooran. West Indians are known for their power which shines in T20, but Pooran has real class.",1
Fuckkkkkk,3
Is he gonna single handedly defeat us!,7
Get him quick man,1
Pooran should always come at 3 or 4,1
Pooran's batting is so satisfying to watch,2
The ball is gonna go 180° around the boundary lol,3
Pooran can throw his wicket being reckless,1
Pooran making himself undrop able when Gayle is fit,2
Jeez Christ,1
One man army,1
Good effort but can't do anything.,1
5th bowler quota will kill us.,1
Why are they bowling pies again and again and again like absolute idiots,1
Who is that Dmitri Mascarenhas look-alike in the KXIP crowd?,1
Is Pooran of Indian origin? Kinda looks like one and bats like one too.,1
Fuck me Nic Pooran is contention for being the sweetest pooran along with puran poli.,5
Pocket dynamite - why do they referring Pooran like that?,3
Pooran I Love you,2
Just take single now.,2
"Poorans dancing down the pitch fuck yeah , now that's the intent !!",3
"Sending in Mandeep with Pooran would have been the best decision, he can hit the ball really well and is in perfect form",2
YESSSSSSSSSS THAT'S HOW YOU KILL THE 5TH BOWLER,8
Wow Nicolas pooran is gonna be the costliest player next auction,2
Pooran's tired of rest of the lot,3
Ohh Daddyy!! What a six!!,3
Rahul really got the most successful opening partnership of the season out on his own,3
Bc we are in danger. He is completely changing the match. Our bowling is shit,5
I hope WI cricket don’t waste Pooran,6
POORAN I apologize profusely for bad mouthing you,3
Don't let any spinner other than Rashid bowl to Pooran,3
Holy fuck,2
Oh jeez. That is one heck of a shot.,2
Great stage for maxwell also to comeback inform.,3
Omfg what’s pooran doing,1
Bruh,1
"Pooran you're a beast man, absolutely amazing",2
SRH's weak link is their fifth bowler. Undoing what Rashid Khan does in their combined 4 overs.,3
Take that towel off boy! 🔥,1
"When pooran and Maxwell are batting, don’t bring in part time spinners",2
"Better XI? perhaps

1)Gayle

2)Mayank

3)KL(C & WK)

4)Mandeep 

5)Pooran

6)Maxwell

7)Mujeeb

8)Bishnoi

9)Shami

10)Arshdeep

11)Porel",2
KXIP .. Pooran is your man.,1
Pooran will do a Corey Anderson MI vs RR 2014.,1
Pooran Puran poli khaake aaya hai,2
Pooran has to be dropped for this.,2
Team should be renamed Sunrisers Bairstow and Warner cause they are the only people who are in everything. They perform with the bat plus Warner is great in the field and effecting run outs and Bairstow is keeping wicket. See you in the bottom 4 Sunrisers Bairstow and Warner.,6
This is such a KXIP match. Weird af.,2
"Kumble: ""Pooran was going to sit out for Gayle.""",3
105,2
"Pooran is a solid player for WI, hope they don't lose him because of internal issues.",5
"Pooran dropped Samad earlier

Now punishing him",6
Its incredible how much the commentators are still wanking over Maxwell because of a few innings a few years ago while one of the most talented batsman in the world rn is batting like a dream on the other end.,6
105M,3
What the fuckkkkkkk,2
Bowl your regs maybe eh warner.,4
Wow.,3
"Why not Abhishek ,,",2
"He's a beast man, Maxwell should learn from him",3
Pooran vs SRH.,3
Oh wow!,5
You thought Maxwell would hit sixes but it was me Pooran !!!,3
FUCK,5
I'd rather have players who score 30-40 runs per match for 10 matches than 1 90-100 every 10 matches.,5
OMGGGGGG NICHOLAS CHAD-RAN,4
OMFGG,2
Damn boi......and they were planning to switch him out....,6
"Someone throw the damn towel, he is dead. Bc fuck",5
Shambolic,2
Finally he shows up FUCKING FINALLY.,4
Mate mate mate mate mate,4
Orey endi ra adi,5
Is this the fasted half century,2
bruh,3
Samad jumps in dinda train,6
KXIP doing the right thing attacking the weak link which is our 5th bowling option. Now I am afraid this will make SRH bring back Vijay Shankar for extra bowling options.,4
Irfan Pathan is not happy now,3
Pooran you beastt,3
105 meters? Is this biggest in this IPL,5
Big Dick Pooran!!!! What a playaaa!,3
Maxi is hot 😘,-1
Beast,2
Well there goes our match bois.,2
Holy shit Nick,2
We are fucked,6
Pooran be like I'll have to do it alone!,8
Is Pooran compensating for something with these long shots,7
"17 freaking Balls.

Jeez.",9
Nicholas Pooran has come to party 🥁,9
"That just equals Jofra's 105m for the biggest 6 this tournament, so I can only assume Pooran's gonna throw down a 95mph bouncer next match",10
"Ffs, we need a 5th proper bowler. Pls end this shitty experiment by finding someone.",8
That is pure garbage bowling lol.  Same overpitched ball again and again.,8
"**KL Rahul while chasing in IPL 2020**

To think that they were about to drop him today,7
Pooran has arrived at the IPL!,5
"Bench Samad please, bring back Shankar. Samad is very underwhelming with the bat and clearly struggles, seems like a blind hitter with intent but no execution, and he’s also been very expensive with the ball",5
Mother of God!! This shit is unreal. I am getting some serious DreRuss vibes,3

Ok. Bow for Lord Pooran! 🙇,7
"welcome to another episode of ""Spot the Preity Zinta""",8
West Indians agaist spin is just not fair lmao,10
"You're a legend already man, gosh what pure class hitting, beast incarnate",3
Wow! Just what KXIP needed,7
Damn!,3
315 sixes already. Looks like 2018 record of 872 sixes will be broken this year,7
Well SRH just lost. Good night y’all,6
Pooran is laying into Samad here...,5
"This is literally polar of KL's inning, wtf",5

Fuck i thought it was gonna be caught holy shit,6
That's proper harassment. Srh can file a report,6

How I wish we had a player like Pooran in our team.. unfortunately we only have Jadhav..,6
Good night?,7
Pooran strike rate is insane right now,10

Ohh Daddyyy! More daddy moree! give it to me Pooran,9

The reports of KXIP being dead were greatly exaggerated,10
Brain-dead shit.,7
Had a great WC this Pooran,7
wtf,3
Holy smoke pooran what a beast,8
I want to be told what Kumble said to Pooran after that dropped catch. It's the kind of boost I need in life,15
Damn boi!!!,3
This is Insane from pooran,8
"Sigh..
Off to gym",10
This is painful,9

Five boundaries in an over... damn,8

"In all this shuffling, stick Pooran at the top and give him as many balls as possible!",9
Now was the time to accumulate from the other end by KL.,9
Goddamnit we bought the wrong West Indian once again,14
Can Maxwell play a sensible second fiddle to Pooran?,8
"KL if you stayed anchor to THIS, that would make a lot more sense",13
Jeez hopefully this one over flexibility is useful in the end,7
Can't wait for Maxi's 7 (11),10
"Good, he didn't go for an ego shot. Play long Nicky P.",11
Samad slowed down the run rate by coming before KW and now this. Just bring in 3d ffs,6
Pooran's not even a big guy still hits them big like the Windies bois.,16

Poor guy samad..... Poor-an guy really,5
Punjab’s back in the game,7
17 balls Pooran's fifty is the fastest in IPL2020,5
Law of averages finally catching up with Pooran,3
28 runs with a dot ball. Crazy madlad.,7
Bruh I look at people suggesting who to retain and I'm the only one suggesting to retain Pooran,10
"So spinners/bowlers of r/Cricket, what to do when you start getting hit like that by a batsman who starts looking invincible all of a sudden?",6
No one as good as Pooran right now in world T20 cricket when he's at his best..,10

4D Chess by Pooran.. take 28 off other bowlers so they can make sure they don't lose wickets to Rashid,10

 KXIP fans getting their hopes up when rrr is 10+. Did they forget they lost when their team needed 1 of 2!,8
Doesn't that Tum Apna Dekho guy look like Tom Hiddleston?,3
KXIP management is probably going to leave Pooran out next game for making everyone else look bad.,12
Don't forget this is fucking Dubai! Does that top Lord Tewatia?,4
Stand and Deliver stuff from Pooran.,3
"43 of 2 overs of the 5th bowler, I don’t have the heart to watch the remaining two",6
7th six was a combo breaker :(,4
Please don't do anything stupid against Rashid now. take just 5 odd runs,10
He is going to hit Rashid I can feel it.,6
Funny how Kumble not taking photos by his DLSR Camera after Pooran hitting 28 runs in an over,7
3 100 m+ sixes holy fuck,10
[removed],-4
"JS - if DK was the captain that got a rookie like Samad to bowl to Pooran, we'd be memeing him into oblivion

This one backfired on Warner big time",3
Chooran power!,2
Such a stark contrast between Samad and Rashid,3
"Fuck off 105,106 mtrs six 
Gee oh wiz trade for him someone",4
Rashid need to break this partnership or else we r fucked,3
"He's done a good job keeping SRH's cumulative 5th bowler under the pump, on to Kanos now",3
"100m, 105m, 106m...damn",7
Just get 2-3 from the over don't take risks,4
"Can't believe I am saying this 

We need 3D boi to come back",7
Just play out Rashid guys pls,3
Unlike Hetmyer he is mature in how he paces his innings.,16
"If Punjab win, they'll go straight up to 5th position. That's how much RCB helped them with the NRR",7
Nicky Poo will win this,3
"106 metre six, WTF",7
Pooran please don’t face rashid. Anyone else you can hit,4
Leave Rashid alone. Win match.,3
"This is the line and length you bowl as a leggie Samad, hope he learns from Rashid and grows as a cricketer. Rashid is a real talent.",6
Samad got Smashed. Oh boy!,1
3D shankar smiling at a distance,6
i rage uninstalled all the social media after watching the end of the yesterday innings.,5
HDFC Bank > ICICI Bank in terms of customer service. Thoughts ?,-1
fuckin bats,1
Maxwell should really step up here,1
"Pooran's got a huge contract coming for him. Fleming, I want that hand raised in the auction until we get him",4
They might have to bring Kane in the leggies are gonna struggle against pooran,3
Maxi join the hitting pls,2
Plz pooran....just play our Rashid.,1
Plsss get pooran out Rashid😭😭😭,3
I can see where this is going.....,2
"Well they are bowling to him in his hitting arc. But to smoke them for 100m is just something else. Personally, I'd rather stick with the left arm spinner & have him bowl fast, ful yorkers way outside off like Krunal did. But you've got Maxwell on the other end. So there's that. So maybe bring in the pacers after this rashid over just to get a grip on things. Pooran might still smoke them for six. But you tip your hat if he hits your seamers for 4 sixes in an over.",6
Kanos should bowl next,3
"Pooran can even block the fuck outta Rashid here and smash the rest.

No one will complain.",6
SRH loses every single time Rashid gives away runs. He's the key.,3
Is shankar injured or dropped,1
Pooran just went bigger and bigger in that over,4
"Nicholas Pooran is the Cristiano Ronaldo of Cricket.






Nobody comes close to the level of flamboyance he has.",0
**Max** translation in Hindi = **Pooran**.,1
"Who will take pooran's wicket.

Maxwell or Hyderabad.",10
"Pooran: ""Look at me, I am the Maxwell now.""",9
Just.Play.out.rashid.pls.,5
Rashid you brilliant cunt,5
pooran sabko chooran dede.,4
Pooran go brrrr :),1
Pooran will survive this over!,1
Maxi go back to your old fucking stance ffs,2
literally anyone can become a commentator smh,3
The firework gonna start again now.,1
Who's gonna bowl next? Kanos?,2
Anyone knows why maxi change his stance ?,1
Bowl kane you cowards,4
Glen Singh Dhoni.,7
"Wasn't the KXIP management planning to drop Pooran in favour of Gayle today? I saw that being mentioned on this thread.

Bet they'll be relieved Gayle got sick today.",7
Maxwell trying to pull a Tewatia,2
Maxwell will be shit the entire IPL then score a 50 ball 100 his next international T20,15
5 singles off Rashid. Perfect!,1
Nice **forward defence** by Maxwell,2
"Only Maxwell is braindead enough to try and take on Rashid, so if SRH can count on anyone to win them the match, it's Maxi",7
What's with Maxwell's stance,5
Bro wtf just happened. I thought it was an easy win and stopped watching,8
Rashid is pure class,5
Did Pooran not get the “take it deep” memo?,10
"Glad KL didn't eat balls cuck this brilliant middle order again. This is what happens when you give people a chance, ffs.",5
Imagine Mayank being there with Pooran,7
Punjab is playing only 6 batsmen. We should also adopt that approach now. Can’t keep using part-timers for this bs.,4
"There is about 100 more to get and only pooran, maybe mandeep are going to score them. How is Punjab on top??? I'm confusion...America explainnnn",1
Unpopular opinion but kxip should bring in Jordan. He might have been costly and totally out of form but if he starts performing like he is in England he will solve the death over woes of kxip.mujeeb is good in the middle but you have Bishnoi and murugan Ashwin so that move makes more sense for me.,3
"Honest to fucking God, have any of these commentators watched Maxwell bat? ""Can he play the anchor role"", someone asks. 

ALL of Maxwell's best T20 knocks have come under pressure, when he's played the anchor role whilst accelerating at the right time. I know his form in the IPL sucks but fuck me, they make him sound like some sort of an idiot. Did they forget his ton versus India in Bangalore last year? One of the greatest T20 knocks of all time and he took the side over the line single handedly, versus peak Bumrah Chahal and Kuldeep.",16
"Pooran 58(21)

Rest combined 38(39)",8
Rashid gets a lot of respect from the batsman for someone so young,10
Scenes if Samad is given 2nd over now...,3
Is Maxwell playing nights watchmen tonight?,2
Afghan jalebi!! Really....,3
"Fuck 106 from 60, pooran gonna finish the game in few overs",3
"Aaaannnnd KXIP almost dropped Pooran today for Gayle. 

Take that u dumbwits.

PS: Drop Cottrell",3
Warner must forget about that fifth bowler  for now. Get pooran out first.,1
Dropped.,1
Rashid is the Afghan Jalebi,5
Ahhh fuck shoul4have caught that. Bad luck,2
So it's a given now teams facing SRH only have 16 overs to do some damage,5
Should have gone with sandeep. He is not a death bowler,2
It has to do something with the culture in the Caribbean that is perfectly compatible with T20 cricket.,7
"Kedar Jadhav is paid 7.8 crores per season, and Pooran 4.2.
Let that just sink in.",6
Pooran playing really smartly rn,3
"Maxwell: Take my wicket please

Nattu: I don't think i will",2
Luck has forsaken us.,2
Ahhh naattuu. Catch that buddy. What the hell,1
Maxwell looks all at sea.,5
maxwell should have a different stance for t20 and odis.,5
Maxwell you shit. Nair is better than you,5
Dinesh Karthik still wondering why KXIP sent Pooran up.. or even picked him.,7
"Uh oh probably the best choice but that means Natu only has 1 over in the death. 

It up to leaky khaleel",3
Almost that maxi soft dismissal again,2
8-10 would be enough from this one. We have the fifth bowler to attack,2
Dugout with more Badri and less Bangar would be blissful,1
When was the last time Maxwell played an inning of consequence?,1
2 more overs of 5th bowler. I wonder when can we bowl them,3
is the match dropped ?,2
CaTcHes WiN mATcHeS.,3
Pooran waiting for samad,5
Maxwell is being Jadhav for KXIP,7
All Punjab need to do is to bat 20 overs and they win this .,4
Laxman is dead inside,9
Maybe I just misheard but did the female commentator just say the bowler wasn't aware the ball could come back at him?! Does she think he hasn't ever played cricket before?,8
PPT presenter Laxman back.,17
Oh Laxman where is your neck 😂,5
oh ffs VVS don't bore us now,0
Maxi looks like he has forgotten batting. And he arrived here after a great series against England,10
Is it just me or vvs Laxman speaks the most clearly out of all coaches(or management),16
Wtf is up with Maxwell,10
Maxwell with Chanderpaul's stance and playing him too,8
I'd like to see Nattu take a wicket with Yorker(bowled). His Yorker is kind of restricting but not threatening at least till now.,2
Can't be friends with people who don't like Nicholas Pooran.,8
Maxi what happened to you my boy?,9
"That's a full toss maxi, please middle SOMETHING",8
Minwell can't even put away full toss,9
"Laxman knows so much about the strategy and talking about it freely.

David Hussey the other day was basically like “I have no idea why they haven’t bowled Narine yet, I am batting coach” lol.",13
Will Maxwell pull off a tewatia or a Jadhav. The number of new cricketing terms we're getting this year,20
Can warner bowl?,3
VVS: we expect Rashid to not give runs and pick wickets. Wtf!,8
"I dont follow Aus matches, I have never seen Maxi this miserable",12
"VVS: Best T20 bowler,  Rabada: Hold my Purple Cap",14
"Mute your VVS interview, and here you have him trying to sell you a insurance policy",6
Maxy isn;t in touch.,2
Not that it was ever likely to be stopped but that is a shocking effort from short fine leg,2
Why tf Maxy is playing like a bitch,2
"The plan is clear pooran attack, maxi rotate",2
Laxman is being too optimistic and it’s making me worried,6
"If he goes like this, they just gonna need 6 overs to finish thus",3
Three full tosses on a trot now,4
I remember laxman getting bowled by one of the most insane spin bowling I've ever seen but I can't remember what the bowlers name was... He was an englishman,3
"6 off last 9 overs to be bowled by Khaleel Sandeep and Samad/Abhishek. Just play out 3 overs of Nattu and Rashid, this is in the bag.",6
Maxi performing opposite of what he does in international t20i,8
"Ah fuck, another boundary. Fuck this shit. Laxamn bc, why didn't you find good bowlers and middle order in last 5 years",4
"It’s kxip game now, I don’t have any doubt",5
"Maxi needs to be yeeted tf outta this team, bro’s not doing shit for KXIP",2
Pooran making chooran of our bowling,3
Maxwell do something,2
"There is no shortage of horrible Indian commentators, but Badrinath is near the top of the list for me.   He makes no sense.",3
Oh that's a demoralising sight for any bowler,2
Man maxi looks absolutely woeful,2
Man the commentators voice is echoing all around the stadium...whoever came up with the idea?,6
VVS Laxman is the type of guy to give a five mark answer to a one mark question.,19
Mahendra Chanderpaul Maxwell.,6
Laxman acts like he is the anchor of heegu unte,7
Let Pooran take the game to 140-150 while Maxi plays the second fiddle and then Maxi can finish from there,5
I wonder if perhaps Holder can get a game. I would love to see West Indies red ball captain on the park.,6
Mark Nicholas is drunk,16
Holy shit! Laxman is soon gonna bring a ppt and present his thesis.,25
Lmao,3
Lmao slats messed up,4
lol Nicolas asking Laxman about Maxwell,11
"Asking Laxman about Maxwell's lack of match winning performances

What are they expecting him to say? ""He's a shit cunt, glad we don't have him""",59
It's here bois 7(11),7
Finally a nailbiter we all asking for,3
Lol... That's peak shitty commentating.. don't even know which team Maxwell is playing for..,22
Wtf asking VVS about Maxi as if he’s SRH,29
Mark Nicholas is only good for EA Cricket 07 nostalgia,14
Hahahaha slats,5
That's out.,3
Maxwell I hope you find soon man.,7
Mark Nicholas is drunk LMAO,13
FUCK ME,4
"Oh yes bc haaat, gone. Should have been on first ball",2
Mark Nicholas wtf bruh,9
Mark Nicholas being Mark Nicholas.. he is so full of himself.,8
LMAO,2
Oh no,2
Well,2
Garg has been the best fielder this tournament,11
Pooran hits a 100 and KXIP loss possible.,5
Watch Maxwell go for 12 crore next auction somehow,13
Fuck this shit. Truly no luck for KX.,2
gya fudduwell,3
Bye bye maxi,3
Garg is gun of a fielder,6
That was epic Garg❤️❤️,2
ohh maxii. misses out agaain,3
The way Pooran has played he has pretty much ensured that Universal Boss replaces Maxi.,8
Oh noooo 😭💔,6
What a run out!,8
What a throw. Fuck!!,6
Maxieeeeeeeedd,2
RIP Maxi,3
That looks out,3
lmao maxwell what a sh!t c#nt,4
"That's a brilliant bit of fielding

One stump to hit",6
Garg you beauty,9
Garg again what a fielder,8
SRH is the best fielding team.,7
Just pathetic Maxwell,4
Omfggg,2
lol love Laxman's reply to Mark's stoooopid question about Maxwell who plays for KXII,7
Punjab literally ran themselves out of the match,12
Gayle for Maxwell next game plssss,7
"maxwel, finch, ab, Stoinis among others

all trash when it comes to their ipl teams. cant handle the money or dgaf

edit Chriss lynn, steyn, altho steyn just plain sucks now",-10
Haha that was epic asking Laxman about maxwell 🤣😂,10
MAXXIIII ;((((,3
Damn the battle for the wooden spoon is exciting,1
Maxwell continues to get out on the last ball of an over.,3
Better than Kedar Jadhav at least.,4
Pronto max🅱ell,1
"Next match, Gayle in and Maxwell out..",3
Punjab don't want to win lol,1
Natarajan has honestly been great this IPL. Probably not ready for test cricket yet but if he polishes those rough corners he can be a deadly limited overs bowler. Only issue is his bowling isn’t that of a wicket taker but atleast helps build pressure.,9
So once again Maxwell is definitely getting released before next auction,6
That is sensational by Garg!!! Maxwell can fuck off though.,7
Garg has been fielding brilliantly for us,12
Was that Garg again? Holy shit he's been impressive in the field,12
1 stump wicket,7
Mandeep come on boi show em how it’s done,2
Maybe choosing the teams with the name that I like the most to support wasn't the best idea,3
That was a great run out,5
Maxwell’s love for single digit scores is mind-blowing,2
Lol kxip absolute clown car. Honk honk,3
"On a scale of 10 to 10 how retarded was that question from Mark Nicholas

And he dared to double down on that, tells you the state of comms nowadays smh",12
"**10.6** Natarajan to Maxwell, OUT,  **105-4**

GJ Maxwell run out (Garg) 7 (12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 58.33",1
Maxwell finding a new way to get himself out again and again...,4
Poor Maxx. He must be devastated.,3
as a Maxwell fan im disappointed but im overall happy get Pooran too please!!!!!!!,3
"Absolutely unnecessary run, Maxwell is trash",2
7(12) is cursed,8
"Great, next pooran pls",3
Pls get pooran out bois,1
Fuck off,2
Where's the *bring 3D boi in place of garg* squad?,5
Glenn Singh Dhoni,3
"Jeez, what a fielder Priyam Garg is. Absolute gun near the boundary and infield.",6
Play jordan or neesham instead of Maxwell.  Maxwell seems completely off.,3
What is the use of a maxwell?,7
Glenn jadhav,3
Did Swann just say on your bike maxi? What does that mean?,6
Finally a good runout in this year IPL,7
lol someone predicted maxi's 7(11) just a few minutes ago,10
Pooran please get him out somehow.,4
Does anyone remember the last time that Maxwell delivered when the team needed?,3
"Even if SRH wins, they are not gonna get any NRR advantage",2
"Maxi performed sudoku.


It was either him or Pooran with the way he was stuck.",2
"No sex for Maxwell in 56 balls this IPL, next to Jadhav",3
Get ready for some VERY sharp running and consistent 8-10 run overs,6
"I am happy it's Maxwell not pooran

  


2020 is strange",3
misery misery misery thats what you've chosen : ~~green goblin~~ garg goblin.,3
"Not Maxwell, but Minbad",3
"Good game lads , rest untill next year.",5
now they won't even feel bad while bringing in gayle lmao,8
This game is done,1
Specialist fielder Garg,1
"Gosh, fielding has been on point today",1
Thank you Priyam Garg. Maxwell forgot how to bat last month. He will be back to his normal self in December.,4
RIP IN PEACE ✌️,-2
I think Maxwell should retire from ipl especially from ever playing for punjab,1
Why were KXIP going to drop Pooran for Gayle when there's a highly underperforming Maxwell just asking to be axed,3
I hope that the Maxwell bubble bursts after this IPL.,5
"My reaction RN: oh no, anyway",3
MAXED OUT,3
Man this IPL has cringiest adverts,8
"Credit where it’s due, SRH are absolutely firing at all cylinders in fielding",10
Don't worry a 35 ball hundred coming soon,3
People were asking if Maxwell will go Tewatia or Jadhav way? He went the MSD way.,7
PLEASE GET NICHOLAS POORAN OUT ALREADYYYY PLEASEEEEE,2
Garg has been fielding quite remarkably,3
Maxwell has severely underperformed in IPL. He has only had one good season.,11
So not pooran maxi is getting dropped for Gayle next game,6
Last pair of known batsmen. My eyes are glowing.,6
"Unlucky Maxwell. 

But at this point they are better off playing Sarfraz or Kaptan if Gayle is unfit",6
VVS Jinxed it live,8
chris gayle to open next match agarwal to bat at 3..,2
Wanted Pooran but will take it.,3
"Maxwell, please stop sucking. Honestly this wide open stance doesn't help him at all in T20, every run he makes looks difficult.",4
SRH fucked themselves by running him out,3
The commentary is so fucking shit. The commentators job is not to just summarise what’s happening on the screen and state the obvious. There’s no valuable insight,14
"How many ""do bhai - dubai"" jokes do y'all reckon the MI squad makes with the pandya bros",13
"Everyone keeps talking about how dangerous Maxwell is, hasnt really materialized this tournament.",6
Imagine getting out at 7(12). You need to be 7\*(12) while the asking rate is 10. *cries in a corner*,7
Maxwell with a Tuk Tuk academy performance AGAIN,3
This match reminds of the match between kxip and srh in which only Manan Vohra of all Punjab batting played till the end,2
KXIP should let go of Maxwell,3
At least Sanju knew the player's team since he had just two categories: Mumbai player and non-Mumbai player,8
So much pressure on Pooran. He might start chasing shots.,8
"Garg is baby Jadeja who also looks older than him, quite a pattern with these younguns",2
What’s the approach gonna be? Go all out or play defensive,2
The reason Maxwell fails so much in the IPL is because he doesn't take it seriously.   He's here just to make some big and quick money.  Doesn't look emotionally and professionally invested in the iPL,13
"Most useless players this IPL ...Uthappa , Kedar and Maxwell",8
"And the 'no show' continues! 

Man, he really did use up all his luck in that last innings of the England ODIs!",7
Why Sandeep now? Who's gonna bowl in death? Khaleel and sandeep,1
"Gayle and Mayank open, Rahul at 3 maxi out(I didn't want it to happen but it is what it is)


Otherwise get a proper bowler",5
Arshdeep -> Mandeep,5
2 more wickets please,6
Wow 64 off 24 Pooran must be looking SEXY,9
Maxwell 7 (12). watch csk get him next auction,9
"Man Maxwell didnt run very sharp for his first 4 5 steps

Amazing how tiny details make such a huge difference",6
7(12) Jadhavesque from Maxi.,5
"When dhoni says godaddy, is he cheering his teammates or asking them all to go away? Or is it just an ad for godaddy? Damn Pooran really messed me up with those sixes",5
"In international cricket I can be partisan enough to wish for the failure of all opposition players, but since this is the IPL, I can't help but think about what this must be like for Maxwell's mental health. Maybe teams should have a full time psychologist just like they'd have a physio",8
Man ..srh is known for bowling.but this tournament it's all about Johny barstow..they weigh on JB,13
A very jahdav innings by Maxwell.,5
We might as well bring in a bowler for Maxwell,8
Natarajan tightened the screws and it manifested into a runout. Excellent one stump hit from Garg. Azhar did this kind of hit a few times iirc.,7
Warner pumped up is good to watch. They are taking risky singles,3
Just give Pooran the strike,2
I am quite convinced that BCCI cloned Jadeja to get Priyam Garg..,9
Just rotate the strike guys. Abhishek/Samad have 2 overs left.,5
When was the last time MaxMeme scored any runs at all?,7
Maxwell channeling his inner Thala,3
Turns out 2014 was the last time maxwell hit at least two fifties in IPL. Why the fuck are they throwing so much money at him!?,23
Kings problem is that they cannot finish games with either ball or bat this season. I hope that continues at least till this game.,6
Chris Gayle isn’t the most consistent performer but what  does Maxwell provide that he doesn’t? Other than maybe pushing Rahul to one down?,8
Team in red. Need some serious bit of batting to win. A leftie Carribean and mandeep singh at the wicket. Punjab really is rcb redux,6
Badri makes no sense,4
These days they practice with lil stumps. Hmmm.,3
"Remember CSK lost the game seemingly out of nowhere , KXIP have the two good batsmen out there ,all hope is not lost for them",2
Maxwell has been consistently poor in the IPL for years now. No idea why he's rated so high,6
Still can't believe Slats asked if Maxwell is underperforming over the stadium speakers when he was still batting..,3
Warner's PASSION for SRH is incredible,5
Excellent execution by Natarajan.,3
"I was just wondering why no one was hitting the stumps this ipl.

That changed today",8
Pooran crying inside watching Maxwell. Raina 2014 playoff flashbacks.,6
"Even if this is a run out , let's agree that IPL Maxwell is hella overrated. Does not deserve the billing that he gets.",5
Sandeep scared of Mandeep :o,5
How can Maxwell be so dangerous in T20I and be absolute dogshit in IPL where the bowling quality is lesser,11
SRH needs a Jadhav here,6
Welcome to the Thala academy maxi,4
"Now I am bit scared that KXIP will launch the Gayle missle against KKR this Saturday.

For KKR's sake, I hope they pull off this run chase somehow and keep the same team.

Also, rooting to Mandeep to have an impact.",9
[removed],17
Maxwell still getting into IPL teams based on his 2014 performance,12
Pooran can win this single Dickly. Just need wickets to not fall on the other end.,3
Pooran lessgo. Hope my parents don't hear me say Pooran out loud.,6
Pooran waiting for the 2 overs from the 5th bowler.,6
Bit too respectful of Maxwell to celebrate his wicket that loudly,9
"Gun fielding in the 30 yards,",6
The big show has 6 50s in 75 innings lmfao.,8
Tbf maxi was doing his bit alright. He didn't look like he was struggling. Just an unfortunate dismissal. He wasn't required to hit against Rashid.,5
I think the best team that Pooran was part of was last year's Guyana Amazon Warriors.,2
"Yo Kings XI, could you please drop Maxwell and bring in the Universe Boss. Time for some Gayle Force winds to blow through this IPL.",9
Man Priyam is SHARP,4
People dancing for that cred ad is kind of awkward,5
"Pros of Mandeep over Maxwell: can play at a run a ball, can accelerate when needed, great energy and good running between the wickets",5
"I do enjoy a G Maxwell fail, keep ‘em coming",5
Never met a indian with name James Britto,5
"Maxwell 7(12)
Jadhav 7(12)

I'm beginning to notice a pattern here.",15
Camera makes sane people go monkeys,6
The more Pooran stays away from the strike the better it is,7
"I thought coming back to UAE will bring 2014 Maxi but he's just having a horrid time with the bat. 

Weird because his ODI and IPL record in UAE was absolute bonkers, and he was coming off a good series against England.",20
Glenn Maxwell's IPL career is surviving off of his 2014 form,18
Priyam Garg seems to be a complete package. Hope he gets mentored well.,5
When will they bowl Abhishek/Samad?,4
Pooran waiting for those 2 overs,4
is anyone else enjoying Swann's commentary in the dugout? He's been pretty entertaining so far,6
Priyam Garg actually fields like what kohli thinks he does,11
Garg has been an excellent fielder throughout the tournament so far,3
Glenn Minwell is gone already?,2
Maxwell aura/reputation or whatever is literally so immense that he still gets a million thrown at him despite being mediocre for 5+ IPL seasons,5
"Kane is going to bowl, isn't he? Does SRH have any other 5th bowler?",2
"Pooran not taking risk is worrying, he want to smack our young bowlers.",1
I can't remember the last time I watched an innings where a batsman has looked so dominant while his teammates looking so utterly inept.,5
[deleted],3
Purple cap  2.3.4 all MI,4
Maxwell should officially be included in non-performing eleven of this IPL,2
"Sanju ""Sharjah"" Samson vs Rishab ""Matured"" Pant tomorrow.",15
[deleted],7
Just a little reminder that Jadhav got out to Samad...,2
Maxwell shud be dropped next match. Cant play him for only fielding :/,3
"KXIP: ""Mandeep played well at the top, where should we bat him next match?""

Dhoni: ""Send that son of a gun after Maxi at 6""",8
"Nehra ""length bowling"" ""length bowling"" ""length bowling"" is back.",1
To think we would have got maxi instead of stoinis.....happy thought's only now,4
Maxwell needs to be dropped at any fucking cost,7
"Two run outs in a tough chase!

I don’t really care about KXIP but I hate it.",3
"Bruhhhhhhhh KXIP have Mujeeb and Shami at 7 and 8? LMAO pls take care of this, Mandeep and Pooran.",8
It's 2030 and SRH led by Priyam Garg is playing IPL final against Dhoni's CSK,16
"Still got 2 5th bowler overs left

Pooran will be waiting to target those",3
"Sanad : can’t bat,can’t ball,can’t field",-4
Should bowl Rashid now and go for the kill rather than letting the game drag on,3
Say what you want abt Warner’s capitancy but I guarantee you this team isn’t gonna field this aggressively under williamson,2
[deleted],1
Maxwell hasn't even hit a six yet this IPL. No Show.,4
"I'm 99% sure, Maxwell will score a 50 striking at atleast 175 within his next 3 T20I. Dangerous international player but somehow absolute shit in the IPL",5
If only we had an all rounder like Neesham to come,5
Maxwell is just Australian Yusuf Pathan,19
Maxwell was so OP in the 2014 ipl that we keep playing him hoping that he can play even 10% of that form,4
"Maxi wasted a good opportunity, he only had to play anchor",2
The two overs of fifth bowler is going to hurt. 3D is an absolute necessity.,4
Can Manish bowl?,1
Who could be the maxwell replacement for KXIP if they intend to drop him?,5
"Can we name all non-performing eleven of this IPL. 

Dhoni, Jadhav, Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik and who else?",6
Kano in the attack please. He'll knock the pooran out of Nicholas,1
Jadhav-esque batting by Maxi,2
How's many runs would you be comfortable as a kings fan to chase in last 5 overs? Teams have scored 80-90 runs already in last 5 overs this season.,2
Slow bouncer for Pooran plzzz.,1
My prediction is Warner is going to bowl out his proper bowlers and leave last 2 overs to the 5th bowling options. By then KXIP would have lost lot of wickets as well.,2
Do we have any other option for Maxwell apart from Gayle?,2
KXIP have 2 games (against RCB and KKR) left at Sharjah. Hopefully Gayle plays both.,2
"No team looks at Maxwell and considers him a threat. Last time Maxi was one, was 2014. And even in that season if you remember he was gold in UAE, as teams returned to India, he tapered off.",2
Boycott Maxwell. He isn't serious about IPL. Just wants quick cash.,1
Rashid is literally a cheat code,1
Get Pooran. Win match.,0
"Rashid Anna,take wickets any wicket is ok",1
After first match I thought KXIP had a sure shot of making it to the top 4.,7
"If Pooran survives Rashid, KXIP have a good chance of winning this one.",2
Why are people volunteering to embarrass themselves on big screen?,10
I can sense something stupid happening in this over,4
Don’t worry about Maxwell he’ll hit 100 off 60 in an international match and someone will buy him next year for 12 crore just for him to score 6(11) most matches.,8
Sick skill that by Rashid!,5
Bergkamp like first touch from Rashid,1
Maxwell is hyped af. Never seen him in a great form after 2014-15,12
Anubhav is calling in sick tomorrow. He has had too much to drink.,4
Match gone lol,2
Anubhav kaul-account specialist,2
"Tewatia effect ,I like it",1
Mandeep didn't bat deep,8
Rashyyy,4
This is fucked man,6
GET IN RASHIIII,3
"Fuck I hate how respectful batsmen are of Rashid, like just go after him and let him get a chance to take wickets.",12
King Rashid,7
KL Rahul & Glenn Maxwell made a smashing entry to the **Thala Academy** tonight.,4
Rashid khan is in his own league.,3
Imagine the carnage if Gayle and Pooran both turn up in the same match. High time for some bowlers to be humbled by the Jamaican Jamboree and the Trinidadian Terror.,7
"\*Run-out with his leg*

\#JustRashidThings",7
Nice footwork there from YRKFA.,3
RASHID ANNAAAAAAAAAA,7
Fuck this shit,3
"Yes baby, that's young Rashid for you.",6
That's just sex,8
Chad Rashid playing football out there and taking wickets,7
~~YOUNG AFGANISTAN FROM RASHID KAHN~~,10
Fucking beautiful,5
"Ma man, luv u Rashidd",3
""" young "" Rashid",7
Golden rule of playing Rashid- always be on the front foot.. Mandeep will learn.,4
"Manish Pandey,s wife is cute",4
Rashid you beauty,5
Wron'un,1
There goes our last batsman,2
Rashid is a God.,2
Yeah there is reason why Mandeep has only been in the IPL for 10 years.,3
Pooran's gonna run out of partners lmao,7
There's the match.....I guess,2
I was anticipating the exact same ball.,5
Can't wait for Pant fans and Samson fans battle it out tomorrow. Much needed entertainment for us.,3
Those fan moment videos are jump scares of ipl movie,10
Rashid could retire as the GOAT T20 bowler,9
"I knew it's coming, well-done Rashid",2
What a ball,3
Rashid is too good man. Easily the best spinner in ipl,10
Get ready Bois for a 143(67) innings from pooran,5
"Rasode main kaun tha

Phir se Rashid thaaaaa",5
"*nothing more beautiful than that*, camera points towards a cute girl",3
"YRKFA, the best in the world!",7
"Young Rashid Khan from Afghanistan, baby",4
Is it just me or people don't remember Rashid khan getting tonked for 6 and 4 this IPL?,6
"Cmon boys, just hang on",2
"**12.3** Rashid Khan to Mandeep Singh, OUT, **through him!** You can be watchful against Rashid, but that doesn't mean assured success. **115-5**

Mandeep Singh  b Rashid Khan 6 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",3
Pooran gonna get stranded on 81*(37) with KXIP on 167,5
Beautiful googly 😍😍😍😍,3
Srh is sad manideep got out...,2
"If KXIP's woes are in the middle order, why not push Mayank to 3 and Gayle in for Maxwell.

Gayle, KL, Mayank, Pooran",3
Almost every franchise need that brute middle order batsman. Maxwell will keep fetching big money as long as he performs well in international cricket. He is just too tempting.,4
"Commentrator: ""Nothing more beautiful than that""

Cameraman : Say no more fam.",5
absolute peach,3
"I mean, mandeep singh does have an IPL record even worse than Maxwell",3
What is Anelka doing in the SRH dugout?,2
This feels like a match where Vohra single-handedly gave us a proper spanking. That day Bhuvi's Fifer saved us.,11
Rashid is GOAT in T20s,7
Set up by the back heel flick the ball before. Batsman was still admiring that bit of skill.,2
"I might be far fetched but I see a bottom 4 for CSK, RR, KXIP and KKR.",2
seems like not even Lord Khaleel can save Punjab now,1
[deleted],5
Seeing an Indian batsmen getting bowled on spin is such a shame.,3
remember Pooran getting two ducks in the first match and commentators laughing at his expense. him and Tewatia have steely minds,2
"Man, horrible commentary everywhere.Hindi, English and Dugout ,all horrible today",5
Scriptwriter of this match confusing us fr,5
That's about as good a googly as you can get. Beautiful,2
"Hell, yes. Aggression without cheating - everything Warne wished to be but could never emulate to the same level.

Telling the world to fuck off and FOLLOWING it up with fuckoffesque googlies - that's some alpha shit right there. Takes balls because if you fall flat, you become Ramesh Powar (lmao). Rashid has revitalised bragging about big dicks and then actually having a 13-incher - and that's a good recipe for fun times (no homo... I think?)

He's a spicee boii, is that Young Rashid Khan from Afghanistan",6
Nicky P is gonna have to do this alone isn't he,5
So much turn on that googly - great delivery on this pitch.,5
YRKFA you magnificient bastard,3
"Unpopular Opinion:

I'd still give Maxi a few more games and drop Cottrell instead for Gayle.

Cottrell OUT Gayle IN

Simran singh out Porel IN",6
"All down to Nicky P, too much pressure for him, this team sux ass",3
Mandy did not read Rash but no shame in getting trapped by Rash.,3
"Our best option is to just wait for 5th bowler and hope Pooran does something. 


Also Mandeep at 6 makes literally no sense but it is what it is",3
A Braithwaite coming from pooran,3
Wait mujeeb is no 11 right?,5
[deleted],3
KXIP sinking harder than Titanic,6
Rashid's lips must be sealed with the Pollard tape. He is just distracting batsmen with his jokes.,3
"I've seen Mujeeb hit some nice shots in CPL, granted the bowling there is pretty low standards compared to IPL",3
They can’t even support Pooran. What an infuriating team!,6
"A tight slap to everyone, who were crying why KXIP is playing Pooran. Hope you all got to know about his potential!",6
Lets hope Mujeeb can pick him since hes probably played the most against Rashid,7
That's just mind-boggling. Every batsman was facing Rashid to cover his stumps and he still breached the defence.,9
ripper for such a young lad,10
Lmao I thought Kumble was going out to bat bat in a 'fine I'll do it myself' kind of way,11
Remember Mujeeb taking Rashid apart a couple of years ago.,2
Wild swinging lol,3
Maxwell to RCB next year confirmed,3
Why does Warner reaction resembles like any tiktok videos.. FAKE!,2
Is Mujeeb an all-rounder or KXIP stretched their tail?,6
CAN'T SPELL GLENN MAXWELL WITHOUT LAME GLENN,4
"I know people die every year, but this year everyone seems to be dying 🥺",4
"Are Kings XI officially out after this? If so, I just want them unleash Gayle, Rahul, Agarwal and Pooran and just ruin everybody else's momentum for the rest of the tourney.",8
"Pooran looks so good today, I wish he had partners left so that he could have played freely. Cleanest hitting I've seen in a long time.",4
Only thing great about Maxwell is that he has bombshell of a fiance.,1
Mujeeb at no 7 lmao,4
how tf is it the tail already,4
"Mujeeb is KXIP’s 7th batsman? 

~~BAT DEEP~~",6
Imagine Rashid and sunil naren playing for one team,3
Preity gonna blame umpiring again for this debacle /s,1
Lol Mujeeb at 7. RIP.,3
Maxwell doesn't care about performing in IPL. That's all I can think. He knows that someone will still buy him next season anyways.,0
"Sad for Pooran man, dude is getting better and better as tournament progresses... Maxwell disappointed fans again",3
Pooran just waiting for samad,3
Good thing is only 1 over left from Rashid,1
"Need to strike at 12 an over from here,  Pooran’s good but I’m not expecting a 140* from him",1
"IDK whenever I see Warner this dialogue from Lagaan pops up in my mind

""Dus gunaa lagaan dena hoga""",7
Imagine if DC got Pooran instead of Hetmeyer or Carey.,2
12th over was Sandeep to Mandeep lol,2
I mean Cottrell looks like he can tonk sixes at will..,2
Last time mujeeb played against rashid he smoked him for 2 sixes.... this time not so successful so far,2
6/7 will be bowled by bowlers not named Rashid Khan. KXIP still have a slight chance.,3
Wasn't Mujeeb tried as an opener in the CPL final?,3
No Swanny. Dafuq are you doing? 😔,2
So interesting that only non Indian sub continent presence in IPL are 3 Afghani individuals (Udana managed this year ). Who would've predicted this 10 years back ?,10
Rohit Sharma is such a gifted actor... In all the ads he stands out with his acting performances...,4
Khatam hai yeh match,1
Al-khaleel is back. Let's see how Nicky bats now.,3
Who tf is gonna bowl in the death? Kane????,10
"Wtf is Rashid's econ so far this year?

Feel like I haven't seen him go above 6 an over so far",2
"Khaleel gonna eat few boundaries in this over, I have bad feeling.",4
Please don't lose any wicket till the 20th.,3
"Kumble: KL make sure we bat deep

KL: Yes we're playing mandeep dont worry.",18
"2012-14 Narine vs 2018-20 Rashid, who's more unplayable?",15
"There you go, he started again.",6
we have a fighter here!,2
KXIP needs to get over those heartbreaking losses in order to prevent more heartbreaking losses,15
Good attempt.,6
I remember Mujeeb used to play at 11 for us 😂😂,11
Man ... Feeling sad for samad.,7
Samad fucking up in all departments,4
"Samad did the right thing, going for the catch",8
OPEN WITH GAYLE!!!,3
Thank the lords not everyone in SRH is Jonty Rhodes,9
Not too upset abt that,3
"Mandeep played very well at 3 last match so it was obvious he would bat at 6 today. Make him bat at 8 next match and drop him for Nair after that, Kumble.",11
Khodke nikala.,1
Guys Afghanistan is not in the subcontinent. Thank you,4
If KXIP wins this... Pooran will be having 130 atleast.... I'm ready for it seriously,3
Spray and pray khaleel is back. Why didn't you bowl like forst ball. Just stick to line. Two boundaries in row. Fuck,0
"I get that Maxwell hasn't been playing well but the vitriol being spewed here is awful. No wonder he's had issues with his mental health. Criticise the player, not the person.",3
2 pieces of shit fielding and 2 fours lmao,1
Samad would like to forget this day,5
This is the definition of a lone battle,9
Pooran need to score 90% of the remaining runs if kxip want to win,6
What a beautiful shot,4
Gaps in the field? No thanks I'll find gaps in the fielders,4
"Pooran can still do it, he’s waiting for the 5th bowler to come on",2
Pooran just cunted that shot. Malayalis you get what I am saying.,3
Jonty showing us he has still got it,1
">Are yeh to apna aadmi hai

- Sehwag watching Pooran",5
Samad needs to be in infield too.,1
Lord khaleel trying his best to make the match interesting,5
Too much pressure for Pooran now,2
Lack of Bhuvi starting to show.,3
What an innings.. fighting alone..,2
"That's bad fielding from Sandeep,bhe should have stop that.",5
"If Punjab loses, it's due to shit running between the wickets",1
"Prithvi for Khaleel
Either continue with Sandeep or give chance to Thampi",1
"Punjab to Pooran - Okay Nic, good job. Just give us another 70 off 30.",4
But Samad can't field saala,3
This is reminding me of that one game in 2017 when Manan Vohra was batting on a different surface against SRH but all the other KXIP players shat the bed.,5
Those 2 fours should've gone for 2 runs between them lmao,2
Pooran is waiting to feast on those remaining two overs. I've got a bad bad feeling if we don't remove him soon.,6
pooran’s 77 (32) jesus,8
We should be running through this batting order from the other side.,8
Our bowling is so unreliable now without Bhuvi. We can't defend 200s now.,10
You should bowl out Rashid. The 5th bowler will get carted if Pooran is still there. He got 28 of 1 over from Samad.,1
I want Pooran to get a 100.,7
"Nehra ""Yorker is not a wicket-taking delivery""😒",9
"whoever said Khaleak on here is as accurate as bapu nadkarni, Lasith 2010-2015 and jimmy anderson with darts in hand",3
Are they taking review on Mujeeb? 2020 is weird.,3
This looks chaseable ..,4
We're bottling it and I don't even give a shit anymore.,1
"Yess, out out , review if you are sure",5
"So basically, they're gonna fine KL for his over rate and Warner for that moustache right?",14
Would be one of the legendary IPL innings if Pooran pulls this off.,7
Poora Intent,5
Did umpire gave it to 3rd umpire or we reviewed it?,2
Why if hasn't RR played Manan Vohra yet?,7
Wtf they didn't even review,3
Why are you taking review for Mujib you dumbo,2
Did they fuckin review it after the timer finished,6
he gone,1
"I think he nicked it,",6
Why is Pooran not in LOI Fab four?,1
Can someone explain why the review is being taken if not reviewed by srh,9
"How is Mujeeb in at 7, he's batting like a No. 11 atm",10
"Wait, how does this work? If the umpires wanted to check it why did they wait for the review?",10
I'm so confused. Why is this a thing?,8
The 5th bowler(s) still has 2 overs left....,7
Too much to do for Pooran. KXIP has an epic tail with Mujeeb batting at 7.,8
"Pooran has to do a Pooran again.  76 of 37 needed. SRH - lets go bois! We got this,",1
He can only check for a bumped catch. Can't go to ultraedge,3
Is Mujeeb a number 7? Did he smash Cottrel in the nets or something?,1
Did Nehra never bowl a yorker in his career?,2
"Send shami, he can smack",3
Mujeeb doesn't even have bat sponsor and playing at 7,7
So teams can just wait and gamble that the umpires will check it anyway?,7
KXIP team selection has been weird,4
Doesn't mujeeb bat 11 for Afghanistan what's he doing at 7,4
Wtf is happening?,3
"If Pooran makes KXIP win this match, I'll be traumatized for life.",2
"Expectation: KLPD and Mayank vs SRH
Reality: Pooran vs SRH",1
What's the point of soft signal when it's third umpire who needs to check everything and take a call.,5
Taking review for Mujib is *Not Stonks*,1
Why not going for snicko,1
Umpiring has been a non stop laugh riot.,3
Did he even edge it?,2
"Pooran's got nothing to lose at this point, he should try to smoke every ball.",6
"Someone explain please, how did SRH did not take the review?",2
I vaguely recall seeing comments on earlier match threads that Rashid's been figured out this IPL,4
That hit the ground not an edge,1
3rd Umpire taking a nap,2
This review from umpire side has been happening quite often now. These are not the rules.. correct me if I am wrong.,7
Total shit umpiring this whole ipl and now 3rd umpire taking his sweet time,8
Did they review?,3
Ball has pitched clearly??? what?,4
Just do ultraedge,3
Mujeeb's bat is quite clean and plain. No even one sponsor,7
Ngl I am super confused on what’s going on,6
Its not a bump shot now fucking move to ultra edge and don't waste our time goddamnit,4
Why not check ultra edge?,4
Show the ultra edge detector fuckers,5
what the fuck?,3
Why didn’t they use ultra edge?,7
What the fuck was that?,7
WTF? Why are umpires allowed to review their own decisions? What’s the point of team reviews?,7
Wtf,2
Can't you review it from the batsman's perspective. Good.,1
Why no ultra edge?,3
Khaleel bowling action is very similar to that of Starc,2
That's.....bizarre,2
Khaleel strikes,1
"Ohhh God, thank you. Thank you. Atleast. Someone is getting out.",3
Bruh just go to ultra edge,2
Lol wtf is this shitshow,7
He's reviewing it? Wtf is happening here,4
Yes mujeeb,3

Wtf is going on.,7
Good from Mujeeb that he can review that.,3
Lmao,4
WHAT????,7
Mujeeb asked for drs lol,8
How the hell did y’all not show ultra edge,8
What a shit show,5
WTF double review,4
Best way for SRH to win is to get Pooran's wicket. Getting the other 10 wickets is not a bad option though.,7
Ahahahaha what is this,3
Why did the umpire review it?,2
Mujib :- right back at ya!,5
Lol tf is going on.,6
Circus.,7
Lol.. another peak level shithousery umpiring..,10

Wtf is happening lmao,2
Umpires nowadays are shit!!,3

Wtf is happening?,4
"Wtf, village standards",3
What? DRS on third umpire's decision? What is going on?,11
How does India manage to produce such horrendous umpires,10
"Oh well, this is *very* interesting. Never seen this before 😂",6
Wtf is going on there?,7
Cricket is such a meme at times,10
Wtf js going on,5
Oh God what the fuck is this stupidity,4
Who the fuck is 3rd umpire,6
"Cricket is turning out to be a court case. Bring out the rules book, technicalities, re-review.",2
He hasn’t edged it. What a moron the umpire is,3
Absolute clown umpiring,2
??????????????????????????,1
What the hell? I mean how can the umpires do this? 😮😮 Someone explain,2
We might get away this game but we can’t keep playing with a depleted line up and no real 5th bowler. We need to bring 3D and/or Stanlake in this team.,3
Umpiring shitshow starts,1
UNO reverse card.,4
"Just use the ultra Edge, dumbfucks",6
?????,1
Umpire sus,5
What the fucking waste of time,1
WTF is going on,1

Did Kumble talk about dropping Pooran for Gayle?,3
What a shit show 😂😂😂,3
Referring a referral. Wowww.,5
why the fuck would they not look at ultra edge? Dumb motherfuckers,2
gotta have some good ol suspense in drama in the IPL,2
soft signal BS needs to stop,3
Umpires have done fucked up big time. They never raised the finger correct?,3
Why?,1
Is this a joke?? Umpire there to just watch match from best seats,5
Mujib: **UNO REVERSE**,7
"Ultraedge required surely?

Bizarre umpiring",3
They gave an out without checking the Ultra edge?  Am I missing something?,1
These umps are whack..wtf,3
Reminded me of that dhoni incident,3
Lol.. 3 Rd umpire gave decision. Now they are taking for a review.,6
You can’t get help from dugout for review right. They are legit watching it on tv,3
"Reviewed within 15 seconds of being given out, should be fine",5
Incompetent umpires,5
"Feeling sad for Pooran, doesn't really have a good partner for partnership.",7
Are they allowed to check ultra edge?,5
Why didn't the third umpire use the ultraedge the first time?,8
Warner didnt really needed to take the review 🤣🤣,6
I see your review and I raise another one. Lmao,15
Fucking idiot umpires,4
The absolute state of this,7
These umpires are a joke . And every time nitin menon is at the midst of these,6
"We should not have to review that, the fucker didn’t see the ultra edge, dumb fuckers",12
What the fuck is going on lol,8
Umpires looked like they were walking away from the players,5
Peak IPL drama,15
But why?,3
Lmaoo dramaaa,7
I've seen better umpiring in village cricket lmao,12
Indian memepires strike again,13
Lmao wtf is this,6
Why can't they just start with the fucking ultraedge?,11
Whatttaaay circus,7
All this bullshitery is worst for Pooran concentration,12
What a joke of umpiring.,5

Village cricket lmao,4
What?,5
What's the fucking point in having the drs timer?,4
Lmao mujeeb wasted the review. It was beri evident that he nicked,6
This is so shit from Rahul. I'm so disappointed,6
Did he get told to review from the changing room? You can't do that can you?,6
Made him look a right mug,2
What happened? Can anyone explain?,8
Todays match script written by David Lynch,9
LMAO Mujeeb,7
"Apparently umpire can only go for a referral and only players can take a review.

New thing learnt.",6
What even happened in both reviews,8
It looks like the ball clearly hit the bat.,3
"It's OUT bc, umpire slowing things down for nothing",9
What the actual fuck. Peak comedy.,10
"So SRH didn't initially review, the umpires referred it to the 3rd umpire who didn't check UltraEdge. Then Mujeeb reviews the 3rd umpire decision",16
Lol threw that review,4
Why nkt check ultra edge the first time itself and save so much of time.,10
Why would you review it?,7
Mujeeb just wanted to insult the umpires before returning to the pavilion. I can get behind that,14
"Hes edged it too ?? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


Fam this is a joke",14
Mujeeb... Lmao,9
Wtf is goin on ? 😂😂😂😂,9
"Lol, you can't fucking make this up",8
5D chess so that KXIP lose a review,7
Lol what a waste of review when you might need it for Pooran,4
Peak komedi,2
I want Simon Taufel back🥺,6
WTF is going on?,3
Why,2
"IPL and shitty umpiring, name a better duo",6
Shithouse umpiring,4
Meme sport and I love it,3
Someone just please explain why the fuck the first review even took place. Warner ran out of time didn’t he?,6
The worst umpires of all time?,3
"""Yes ball is passing close to the bat so show me the ultra edge""

No shit sherlock!",9
LMAO Mujeeb,1
How is this anything different from Smith's brainfade moment?,6
My brain can’t handle this,5
David Warner fuming over his 12lakh which is bout to get lost as slow over rate,9
What cluster fuck is this. I love it,3
What is this retarded shit,4
Smashed it anyway lmao,3
Umpire review and then player review. First time am seeing this.,6
This will be hilarious if third umpire overrules his own decision,9
Swann going mental,3
Lol,1
Bruh why did you waste the review though?,6
"1. It was not an SRH review. The third umpire checked whether it was a bump ball. Yes, on-field umpires are allowed to consult the third umpire for that. That's also why there was no ultra-edge the first time.

2. What followed next was a KXIP review. Hence, the ultra-edge.",17
I'll be fuming if I were KXIP. One review wasted because the fucking umpires are inept.,6
Bad umpiring and IPL...name a more iconic duo,6
ultra edge spike before ball comes near the bat lmao,3
If he knows he’s hit it then why review it. So what if dressing told him so.,4
"This is not village, this is Smart™ Village, with modern technology",2
Lmaoooo I love Swann,2
And the award for best movie in drama goes to....,5
Lol what a shitshow of a match this is,4
"Well, that's a first.",3
Isn't there a 15 sec DRS timer?,3
IPL umpiring ^(TM),3
The fuck is going on,1
Ummm what just happened. But the bat hit the ground too right?,3
"Lol you fucking shit, eat that",4
"Third umpire pulled a sneaky one, saw the ultra edge himself but not on the screen. Wasted the review.",9
"This was actually good umpiring, you knobs",3
The other umpire dude did a total confused pikachu when mujeeb asked for a review,10
That accent is painful lmao,1
So in the review they didn't see the Ultra edge but the second time they did wtf was the point of not seeing it the first time?!,4
Review the review system!,3
This is peak comedy 😂😂😂,7
Wth is happening. When you are checking the catch check if he even hit it. Idiots,3
Can someone explain WTF is happening?,2
Can these guys be any more stupid. Originally he should have been given not out soft signal was not out,2
Third Umpire is so fucking useless,2
OMEGALUL,2
Why would he take that review. A batsman generally knows if it's out or not,6
"Mujeeb's wasted a review for no reason lmao

Imagine pooran gets a shocker",3
[deleted],0
Wtf,2
"3d chess everywhere lol, the battle of DRS",2
And then they ask why are there less Indian Umpires representing ICC,3
That was fucking hysterical.,3
They seem to like when camera and focus is on them. Took too long for obvious decision,0
That's the first time I have seen a player going for a review against the third umpires decision.,6
"Umpire: taking review

Mujeeb: yeh meh kar leta hu, aap jake dream 11 pe team banaye",7
Poor Pooran running out of partners,1
Memes XI Punjab,3
ROFL he actually called for a review knowing he nicked it?!,3
Imagine an American watching this,7
Umpire with SRH jersey edit soon on social media....,2
Mujeeb looool,3
Umpires should loose points for the fair play award,4
Better hope pooran doesnt get out of a wrong call,2
Arnab is wasting time screaming over silly things while he should be roasting IPL umpiring.,7
C'mon just get everyone else out now.,2
Don't worry KXIP fans. Second Innings Shami will score 72(12) tonight.,2
"So looks like,

1- Umpire gives not out.

2- SRH does not take review.

3- Umpires take a referral.

4- Third umpire gives out.

5- Mujeeb takes review.

6- Now third umpires used ultra edge and his decision was correct. (I though it was not out).",24
Complete fucking shit show. Need better regulations regarding reviews and soft signals!,3
"Did Mujeeb just fart as the ball passed his bat?

There is no way I can explain that snick...",3
So the drs timer gets thrown out of the window today?,1
"Although I've been following cricket for the last 20 years, can anyone explain what the fuck just happened",5
Absolute joke. The umpiring alone bring down the class of ipl,2
That witch laughing in dugout,2
"Pack expired... Telugu commentary is all I have, absolute 0 level commentary",3
IPL Umpiring™,3
"Why did they ask him to review? He clearly edged it as seen in replays. Waste of review too, now what if Pooram gets a poor decision?",2
Took me a while but I'm starting to really enjoy  Swann's commentary.,5
Wait what tf just happened,3
All Maxwell needed was to stay there,5
Why would you waste DRS on mujeeb when you can use it for Pooran...,10
Mystery spinner took mystery review,4
"He's gone . Imagine if there was no spike, third umpire would have to reverse the decision he gave few moments ago. That would have been awesome.",15
"Wtf, someone stick with Pooran goddammit",3
Rip fairplay award,2
What a clusterfuck,1
DRS ... not be left behind by VAR and Punjab with an absolute bangalorean open mic night of a batting innings.,1
What a fucking bizarre few minutes that was,7
Bring in the 4 th umpire boys 3 aint gonna cut it,12
"Mujeeb ""Steve ""Brainfade"" Smith""",4
Dhruv Rathee is out to bat here,4
"Third umpire: OUT

Mujeeb: Well yes but actually no",8
If Pooran gets out to a wrong call now I will not be happy,6
Why are people acting like the first review was DRS. It was the umpires checking for bump ball hence no ultraedge,7
What shitshow,2
[removed],4
Lolwut punjab,2
Can someone tell me the point of a soft signal if the decision is gonna go upstairs anyway?,6
Bishnoi will fuck these people up,6
"Pooran is a champion, KXIP still in game.",3
Why didn't they show Ultra Edge at first time?,5
[deleted],7
Does this mean we wont be bottom of the fairplay awards anymore?,8
"Am I right in thinking the umpires can't look at ultra edge the first time because it wasn't reviewed on field, so they were looking solely at whether it was  bump ball or not? Otherwise... idk",10
Reviewception,13
"It still seems Pooran thinks that he can win this, poor chap hasn’t gotten used to the KXIP curse yet",16
Can someone explain what happened? What is this bump ball stuff?,6
The third umpire sounds like he's reading off a piece of paper which has someone else's handwriting,13
Mockery lol,4
Why the fuck Mujeeb reviewed it when it was such a big edge. Wasted the review.,7
Is the umpire a fucking robot?,4
"Genuine Question, Is there any possibility that the UltraEdge can be rigged or altered by the 3rd Umpire. Don't downvote, it's a genuine query.",4
Why did the third umpire overturn the soft signal without ultra edge?,5
Mujeeb definitely got the nod to take the review from the dugout,6
"Pooran - 77 (32)

Rest of KXIP - 45 (51)",9
I think this was fair umpiring. The umpire couldn't have gone for ultraedge for the first review as it was only for checking whether there was a bumped catch.,3
Dafuq?,2
this is why cricket fails to gather new audiences. fucking chaotic,3
"It's quite tricky for me. Because the soft signal was given for Bump ball, which was not the case. So, the third umpire gave it out. And then Mujeeb was well within his right to review the decision. Confusing but right procedure i guess",7
Bishnoi with the helmet on looks like someone used doraemon's shrink ray on mujeeb,5
"Pooran should play like a madman now.. if it comes out well and good, if not then match is already gone..",3
"Fucking timeout now?

What a shitshow",4
2 of the remaining 6 overs are gonna be bowled by the fifth bowler (probably Abhishek). Pooran can still pull it off if he capitalises on that.,2
Interesting script today. Focussing on the drama more than action.,8
This is the same as Smith’s brain fade isn’t it? That’s a bannable/finable offence ig.,4
Good timing to take a strategic time out to divert people from this circus.,5
What the hell is this umpiring? Why wouldn't you use ultraedge at the start?,5
DRS times : am I a joke to u,1
Is it me or Hotstar streaming looking fluid. Or my eyes got used to shit stream because I'm watching it daily.,8
"Dude bowl a half volley and make bishnoi retain strike. Why the intensity on Bishnoi, genius?",4
Why did he give him out when the soft signal was not out? He didnt even check if there was an edge...,3
"Now time out, fuckers how much time you are gonna waste. You took loong to take a decision now after one ball you need rest. Haat",8
"wait, what just happened? did they appeal twice? I got distracted :|",3
How come Khaleel bowls sexy Yorkers to tailenders but bowls pies to regular bastmen?,10
"We have wasted less time , let's waste more",6
Why is the tail so long?,9
Fucking scarp ground umpires now. They're useless af,7
During that delay Khaleel ran to Sharjah and back.,6
Khaleel bowling 'Mitchell Starc' line to right handers,5
"in the words of the Immortal Chris Jericho : ""You stupid idiot!!""",6
Swann loving the drama,5
what on earth just happened?,2
Bump ball review by umpires was just their cope.,6
Is it possibe? Yes. Is it probable? No.,3
It feels good watching Warner discuss things with Williamson. Really appreciate that.,7
Now we know what's causing the problem at KXIP,0
"Lmao, pooran needs to score a 140 for KXIP to win this match",2
I'll stick my neck out and suggest that Mujeeb may not be the ideal #7 batsman.,4
Poor old Pooran. His back must be so sore.,4
I swear Pooran hasn't battled in half hour now,7
Why can't you bowl more of that Khaleel,3
Most people not getting what happened here. Basically the umpire thought the ball hit the bat but may have been a bump ball so he referred it to third umpire. The third umpire ensured it wasn't a bump ball and didn't check ultra edge as on field umpire had ruled that it had hit the bat so he gave him out. After that Mujeeb reviewed the decision of the ball hitting the bat. Pretty standard procedure I should say.,15
"Now imagine if KL hadn’t got Mayank run out, and he (Mayank) was around to give Pooran company. KL got his orange cap and turned into the Indian batsmen of old, winning games for the opposition.",2
"What BS. Sometimes these cricketing rules are so much against common sense. Why couldn't the umpire check the ultraedge the first time only?

The objective should be to make the correct decision. That's it. Not to blindly follow some procedural technicality.",9
Imagine if KXIP lose all their wickets except Pooran at the end of the game.,7
"Here is the whole joke:

big appeal for catch behind. Turned down. SRH don't review, but the umpires now send it upstairs with a soft signal not out. Yorker wide outside off, he looks to jab at that and there's a sound as it goes through to the keeper. Third umpire Barde said this review is for bump ball...so the umpire reckons there's bat on it. Which might well mean Mujeeb will go here, because that doesn't look close to being a bump ball and it could be conclusive based on the replays. They haven't checked for the actual edge, no Ultra Edge used, so the umpire thought that was edged. So Mujeeb reviews that decision! Now we'll have Ultra Edge. Another can of worms here though - because Mujeeb was walking towards the dressing room as he turned back and made the decision. Did he get advice?",35
"So SRH got a review without even asking for one, just cause the umpires wanted to check a bump ball? Why are the rules so ambiguous for this?",11
It is not Ethical of Kumble and KXIP. Ethical man Ashwin might have something to say about his former team.,9
Ben stokes would switch everything up for KXIP if we had him,4
Fine the umpire for wasting time,6
"Wow, it's 11pm and just 14 overs.. They're stretching it way too long.",14
"First you gave not out, then waited for captain to go for DRS but he didn't, so you changed your decision and went to 3rd umpire.  This is gully level fuckery",11
Supporting Punjab is no less than sadomasochism,16
"Judging by kxip luck,  pooran will be getting out on a wrong upmire call now",8
i want rr to win tomorrow,4
Why is over rate so slow in this IPL,7
real waste of a review.,3
"Batsman are not allowed to review after they see it on the big screen. Hence, even if it is required to check the bump ball, umpires are obligated to check for ultra-edge (in short, batting team gets a free review). Thats the only way to be fair.",8
76 off 6 overs. Unless Samad bowls his full quota this seems impossible.,2
Yep perfect moment for a strategic timeout right after a timeout,8
Congrats Sunrisers Bairstow and Warner. You're beating the LAST placed team. Big whoop!,0
Just to be clear...he reviewed after his team sitting in the dugout asked him to. They have the privelege of a screen to watch the replay on.,7
"Warner and Williamson working together is nice to watch


They are polar opposite characters lmao",9
Can someone explain me what Bump ball is,3
"It was soft notout, which means 3rd had to check just the bunk ball, it wasn't. So it should've been notout and that's it.

But 3rd ump decides himself there's a nick which there was and reverses the decision against due process because reasons?",8
Bangar and Badri are just to balance out the dugout,2
ELI5 what is a bump ball review?,3
"as a closeted RR fan, I’m feeling for all you KXIP fans rn",3
"When KXIP fans told KL Rahul to screw batdeep, it didn't mean to say that Mujeeb should be sent at 7.",3
Imagine Smith did that in an RR vs RCB match. Kohli would have come to PC all guns blazing.,6
 Umpires are still using trial version of DRS,5
This one decision could cost us a play-off berth. Lmao. How the tables turned.,4
"SRH: decide against the review

Ajeeb: Now I'm gonna do what's called a Pro Gamer Move",9
People here who are bashing umpires here don't know the rules.,9
"If pooran survives till 18th over and if they are not losing wickets from other end, there is a chance for Punjab.",1
Was that a Brainfade™ moment? I thought the batsman couldn't look to the dugout to tell him when to review - seems illegal considering the tech they have?,6
"Ok, for all those throwing a fit

The umpires knew he had nicked it and just referred for clean catch the first time. Ultra edge was not used as it was NOT a player's review and umpires had no doubt he had nicked it",11
They couldn’t even get the decision right by cheating lmao.,8
[deleted],5
Lmao poor mujeeb. Should've told them that he knicked it.,8
"If we go by one per team, I would say the weakest links in the respective teams are: 

Jadhav/Vijay, hetmyer/Mohit sharma, maxwell/Nair/Jordan, Kuldeep/Karthik, Uthappa/Unadkat, Gurpreet/stein/zampa, Samad/Sandeep/Shankar(?)

Mumbai is the only one who don’t have a so called weak spot, maybe Krunal. 
I think the longest I took was for sunrisers though, I still can’t find a concrete one as most performed in one match or the other.",3
"So, MI and DC way too good, sealing top two spots. KXIP celebrating their wooden spoon. So we have 5 teams competing for remaining two spots right",6
I think third umpire didn't use the ultraedge first was because the on field umpires only wanted to check whether it was bump ball.,10
"KXIP - Batting ends at 6 and yet they lose half their side with 8 overs left

CSK - have batting until 11 but tuk tuk around and lose with 5 wickets in hand",11
Did Warner say the coaches signalled him to review? Kumble might have to do some explaining here then.,3
Mujeeb/Punjab management gonna get fined heavy for this tomorrow.,2
Pooran should hog all of the strike from here on,2
With this win SRH go 4th in the table.,2
"List of shithouseries in that decision: 

> Soft signal not out 

> On field umpire asks 3rd umpire without SRH calling for a review, despite he himself ruling it not out

> 3rd umpire overturns soft signal without ultra edge

> Mujeeb walks back, KXIP dressing room asks him to review 

> Third umpire reviews the same decision he reviewed 15 seconds ago and uses ultra-edge 

> KXIP lose their review despite original soft signal going in their favor 


Honestly, what the fuck?",11
KXIP bottom of the fair play table as well. Nothings going right for them this year,2
"Lol, Warner did a 180 right there after watching the screen.",2
Why don't they play Gowtham???? Gowtham at 7 is brilliant,3
"With all this happening, pooran got a good rest and should be ready again to smash",3
"KingsX1 playing tail enders ideally suited to vat at nos. 10,11 to bat all the way from no.7 and it didn't have any positive effect on its bowling either. Gawd, the Rahul-Kumble combo looks embarrassing.",1
"For those who are trashing umpires
1. They waited till 15 seconds whether srh are going to take review or not. They are right according to rules
2. They are sure about edge and only asked for bump ball , so there is no necessary for ultra edge. They are right again.",7
Fair play awards go *reverse* brrr,3
I can see Pooran getting out due to a wrong umpire decision now,4
Atleast fair pla...,2
"[Umpire](https://i.imgur.com/qziuzxV.png) - ""Main madarchod hoon, jo isme aaya""",1
"I think the only way KXIP can win a title is by changing their name to Super Royal Kings XI and having a blue-gold jersey. Also, buying the right players ffs",1
Cricket should break the barrier between dugout staff and on field players.,2
Ohhh my God z if it's wicket I would have ran like mad man. Lol,2
"What happened was the umpires believed mujeeb hit the ball but thought that it was a bump ball. So once it was confirmed to not be bump ball the decision was overturned. But then mujeeb reviewed that he did not hit it, which was told by dugout it turns out, which is not allowed.",3
Warners tache is awful haha,1
Umpires in the IPL are so spineless. They just look clueless,8
Pooran can't do shit to Rashid khan,5
My God what is Sunny's lad on about?,2
"Damn KX are also down on fair play award table, now that's gonna sting a lot more than being at the bottom of points table.",1
Warmer ain't giving 5th bowler to pooran at any cost,3
"Why the fuck are people saying that the umpires' original decision was out? They literally showed no interest in the initial appeal, and even when they went upstairs to check for the bump ball, the soft signal was not out. The third umpire obviously fucked up, thinking the soft signal was out.",4
Rohan Gavaskar's math is blowing my mind.,2
No idea how we almost lost to this team,8
Shocked that a team captained by David Warner would be low down on the fair play league.,10
Was kumble the coach during the smith 'brainfade' moment?,6
Just get to the next over,1
Bairstow is a shit keeper,-1
How is Rashid this good man how,3
Mujeeb did something only Dhoni ™ was given the special privilege to do,2
That's just painful to watch,5
"The points system for that Fair Play Award is completely arbitrary, as clear as mud. What a joke.",14
"Can someone explain to me how the fair play table actually works

Literally seems like it's random",14
"Required 76 off 34, Pooran 77 off 34 lol",11
Pooran is gonna wait it out as he knows he can milk 30 runs each from the 2 fifth bowler overs.,9
Pooran going full Thala,6
"Punjab don't even bat till 4, they bat till 2 and then at 4.",8
Pooran could've given this a good shot if he had bare minimum at the other end,6
Pooran seeing out Rashid is making me nervous. Remember we have 2 overs from 5th bowler.,7
Lol pooran not even running.,9
Swanny has perfectly captured the spirit of a dugout commentary. Deano will be happy.,3
Pooran not running,6
Just get through this over mate,2
"By the way, Pooran only took that review when he was instructed by the KXIP dugout, which absolutely is NOT allowed.",5
Pooran being smart,2
Goneeeeee,6
"If Bishnoi has the strike first ball next over, then they have to get 3 dots with the 5th bowler",2
Now the match is truly gone.,4
All over,3
Wtf,3
Rashid bhai,4
Rashid sealed it!!,10

welp. should've taken the single,3
Rashid won the battle,5
Ultimate Chad Rashid,6
Crazy respect to Rashid and he still manages to get him...what a player!,10
"And that's the game. Rashid is so, so good.",5
After all these he plays that shot . Lmao,6
Well played Pooran. You tried mate.,5
What in the fuck was that?,3
Okay done and dusted,1
KXIP franchise should be scrapped. Boring franchise. Give me a UP franchise/North East franchise,9
Rashid you beauty,3
Omg nooo just two more balls pooran come on,3
What a shitty end.,5
RASHID I LOVE YOU YOU MAGNIFICENT BEAST,7
Bye KXIP. Match over.,5
I love it when teenagers get legends out (｡♡‿♡｡),4
Good night Kings 11,5
That is some of the dumbest cricket I have ever seen,4

RASHID IS A ABSOLUTE BEAUTY,2
Nothing special happening in this IPL after a dramatic start,2
"He was under pressure, only if one of the chuts on the other end supported him",6
"As a Delhi fan from the start - I feel for KingsXI. It gets better guys, trust me.",8
He might not be 18 but Rashid Khan is the real deal.,9
"**14.5** Rashid Khan to Pooran, OUT, **taken at backward point.** **126-7**

"Mad respect for Rashid, his legend continues to grow",3
"Pooran is either gonna smash the fifth bowler's 2 overs for 60 or he is gonna look like a fool for denying singles.

Rashid needs to have a shrine or temple or something built in his name.,13
Same capitancy to load up in the rip bowlers before desth,4
Hope pandey gets an over,1
Well it was fun while it lasted,2
Lol Pooran. Dread it. Run from it. YRKFA still arrives.,5
Bruh you should have ran that,3
"Man , Pooran  really should have hung on for 1 over",3
"I think this is what happened:   
On field umpires thought that ball edged the bat but wasn't sure about whether it was bump ball i.e. it hit the ground before reaching keeper. So they refereed bump ball to third umpire. Now, third umpire only need to check only for bump ball and not for edge. 

And later when Punjab reviewed it for edge.",3

Great innings by Pooran nevertheless",10
Can someone explain to me why he didn’t take the single,5
Samad and abhishek are the happiest people in the world right now,3
This commentator really said it’s as useful as the G in Lasgna. He’s been preparing that for a while,5
SRH NRR stonks today 📈,6
"Ahahaha they were clearly just trying to see off Rashid, why didn't he take a single and watch the rest of the over from the other end??",7
Forget Kohli ABD Warner Gayle. YRKFA is the real IPL boss.,5
Pooran's doing a Jadhav,2
Single would have almost guarenteed Kings victory.,2
"If your team's tail starts at 7, I'd say there's a problem.",3
That was just... I've no words for it,3

We have a bowling attack bitches!!,7
Pooran walking slow to get Warner fined for overrate. /s,4
That was senseless from Pooran,3
Rashid wow,2
"Should've taken the single lmao

Poor Pooran, batted really well though",4
May be just may be Kohli knew all along what he's doing when he sacked Kumble. Awful decision making.,4
"Thanks Punjab for keeping the race to the wooden spoon interesting!

Yours truly,

If rashid doesn't do the job it's going to be pooran vs natraj,3
I can finally see a positive NRR now,4
What a wonderfully bowled spell. Absolute pleasure to see Rashid taking wickets,6
Soon we'll see a video of Maxwell feeding KL with his spoon,7
All my dreams of close match finish ended here.,6
rashid taking wickets is good even if they are in iffy situations,5
KXIP committing sudoku here,7
"Dang. Bad shot and a soft dismissal, but god damn that was an entertaining innings",5
Is it just me or did that spike seem crazy loud for a nick that the umpires didnt seem to hear? Possibly bat hitting ground?,5
Fuck I just yelled as if we just took an important wicket in an international match. Thank fuck for IPL,4
Finally! Thank you Rashid,4
Rashid meri jaaan!!,4

Why even take the effort of wearing a helmet,3
I genuinely feel bad for KXIP,5
"Not that it matters but I wanna see hawkeye on that

May have been high",2
Oh my priety don't deserve this shithousery,6
"**14.6** Rashid Khan to Mohammed Shami, OUT,  **126-8**

Mohammed Shami lbw b Rashid Khan 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",0
I think it's time for the post match thread!,3
Rashid is a God. That's why he's so young and old at the same time. It's the immortality,21
Maiden 2 wickets in 15th over. wow,10
Rashid Khan is a cheatcode,21
Maiden with 2 wickets.,10
Hahaha use that review why won't you KXIP,9
"Thank god for Mark Nicholas and Ian Bishop as every other member of the commentary team is disgraceful.

Makes me realise just how good the sky sports boys are too",5
purple cap > orange cap,11
"*It's Over, Finsh, khatam, Tata, bye bye.*",8
"Rashid will on hattrick next match

Edit: he will not , hattrick is considered only if it is in same match",4
Teams give way too much respect to Rashid,5
"""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand........... Yes"". How Mark Nicholas keeps getting work is beyond me",8
"Game, set, and match. 

Great innings by Pooran. Too bad he had no company whatsoever. And now Rashid has got Shami as I am typing this. This dude is something else.",4
So my Maxwell prediction was ousted by 1 ball he went for 7 (12) instead of 7 (11) fucking hopeless,5
"Shami wanting to review but no reviews left

PEAK MEME MATERIAL",8
Kxip is much more shit than RR,2
Rashid will be on hattrick for his first ball next match,5
Game set boys,1
Kxip are an absolute mess. Pooran legit stat-padded from abhishek and samad overs,5
Srh should start a change.org petition in support of warne's 5 overs per bowler theory,7
"We still have 2 overs of fifth bowler, haha.",3
Me looking at KXIP : bas tum jaise ch**iyon ko sahara hai doston...,6
[deleted],2
The shallow batting line up cost kxip the match . Pooran  defo getting cash tonight tho,3
Double wicket maiden over. Oh my!!!,6
rashid khan’s double wicket maiden.. king shit,3
"I called it during the start, if SRH needs to win they need to field well, that’s what they did, 2 run outs of top order batsmen in 200run chase is pretty much the nail in the coffin",2
"Last 9 balls: 0 runs, 3 wickets",2
Pooran should've just played out Rashid and targeted other bowlers.,3
"I want to change my flair so bad but somehow can't do it. Why I am still supporting this shit team, I don't know myself",3
Why does it look like Cottrell has never worn a groin guard before?,3
KXIP doing reverse of last season. Now will go on to win more and still end up not qualifying by NRR,2
Can Cottrell do a Tewatia,7
Double wicket maiden that!,6
Guess KXIP will rebuild next year.... again,6
At least this should solidify the decision to retain Pooran before the next auction. Every team wants a hitter at 4.,6
"Man that KXIP NRR is taking a hit today, huh?",4
This is the weirdest match I’ve seen in recent times. Can’t make any sense of who’s better..?,5
"IDk how but I would like SRH to somehow retain quartert of YJB, Warner, Kane and Rashid next year. I don't want to see Kane go plsss.",7
Rashid is a legend. He sealed this one. What a guy.,7
shit srh might go 3rd y’know kkr have a nuffie NRR,4
Holy moly Rashid you absolute champion. What an asset to the team.,5
"The IPL started out all competitive and the past week has been one sided, or is it just me?",8
So yeah they didn't need to worry about the bowling at death,8
Pooran's innings reminiscent of Hardik's from the CT final again Pakistan,8
A Happy Kane is the mood for tonight.,11
"KXIP: Just play out Rashid

Pooran: Sure

And then Proceeds to give a dolly of a catch off Rashid and gets out.

Great innings but dumb end.",9
"Shami reaction: Only if I had that review, we'd have won with 2 overs to spare.",15
Double wicket maiden. HAX,5
"Not being sarcastic, Bishnoi has a very clean defensive stroke",12
CSK would have never ended up in this situation. If it was CSK KL and Maxwell would still be batting and Pooran would be waiting in the dugout.,5
Time to get that sweet sweet NRR boys!!,5
"Right now KXIP is mediocre in both bowling and batting and they don't really have bowling reserves to rely on 
 
They just need to go peak RCB imo and stack their batting while blasting 190+ against every other bowling attack",3
Punjab should play Cotterell Jordan Pooran Gayle. All 4 west indians.,2
Watching Bishnoi and Cottrell together gave me blacked vibes,4
Is KXIP out of IPL now if they lose this match? or is there still a mathematical chance for playoffs?,5
I remember Rashid being written off as being found out or just played on,7
"Anil Kumble has to take some blame to have ideal no. 11s batting all the way from no.7.
Seeing how RCB and KingsX1 have played I'd rather have Kohli as captain than Kumble as coach.
What a moron, after having the resources he's had at hand to get this sort of returns.",11
Now whats the strategy for KX batsmen?,3
"Pooran was doing the right thing in that Rashid over expect the single part, One over of Khaleel left and two overs of Kane/Samad/Sharma were left. Man would have loved to see what would have happened if he had taken the single",10
"Kl Rahul should give up his captaincy so that he can focus on his game and play t20 rather than playing ODI in T20.
Maxwell should be next captain at least he will get some role to play, some input from him.",2
Batsman is looking very happy that he got to bat.,7
Finally...We're up and about on fair play,11
What is the point of supporting this team? I think i am brain dead.,13
Intent,8
"sidebar  
reddit app is wank compared to the browser",3
"Kxip ka naam , Jersey, owner, vastu jo bhi kuchh hai change karvao...Warna ye kabhi nahi jeetenge :)",2
Pointless and the most boring five overs of cricket coming up,11
Ffs my boys be vibing at the bottom in the fairplay table as well,7
Kxip at bottom at both the tables... will there be any respite?,4
"These time outs are utter bullshit for the batting team. 

First SRH lose their way, and now kxip because of these unnecessary breaks in play. 

I know players need to have higher concentration, but this has become too much.

Game after game after game the tempo and momentum of the matches is swinged by these marketing gimmicks. I am so out of this shit.",22
The world isn’t ready for batsman Bishnoi,20
Sandeep Sharma bowling bouncers Lmao,7
This game should give us positive NRR,6
In b4 bishnoi 50(20),9
Imagine getting hit by Sandeep's bouncers. xD,11
Nice Jofra lite Vs Smith lite,16
Warner apologising for that ball. Lol,7
You just had to see off 1 ball god damn it,3
Bishnoi giving hope. He changed the match right around here while bowling,7
Clearly the most likely path from here is Rashid Khan completing his hattrick in the super over.,7
Where's the concussion protocol,8
The next few Punjab matches will be interesting just because of Gayle,4
Now bring on the NRR under control damn it,3
Yea Sandeep ya 130kmph bouncer can work with a youngster bowler,3
All the NRR gained against RCB will serve as a buffer for today,9
Can cottrell bat?,1
Just Clone Bishnoi and make  him play instead of Maxwell,5
Maybe kumble isn't as great as r/cricket make him out to be,3
Scotty throwing a shade saying nasty 120kmph bouncer,3
"“A nasty 128 km/h bouncer.” Yeah, nasty for a tailender. Literally any batsman would’ve deposited that 20 rows back.",13
Braindead teams attacking Rashid.,7
"If we bundle out Kxip quickly, we can win with a good NRR boost.",2
Bishnoi with INTENT,3
"Just found out Bishnoi is exactly a month younger than me. Why must you do this IPL, if I wanted to be reminded of my inadequacies I'd just talk to my parents",15
SRH still needs the fifth bowler,18
"Lol Scotty, truer words have never been said. Swanny has an orgasm every time that damn car is on the screen",6
"Could've just been poor showing from KXIP, I'd still say it was a pretty 
good outing for the SRH pacers with no Bhuvi.",5
Rashid is definitely the 3rd best performer today after Bairstow and Pooran. Surprised to not see him in the fantasy top 5.,4
Cottrell to make up for that Tewatia over with the bat this match. You heard it here first,7
SRH is the only team with players who actually act like they WANT to win at any stage of the game. Can't help but root for them.,13
"Cant understand why pooran attacked after playing defense that over , 2 over from samad and abhishek sharma , he cold have easily scored 40-50 runs there",6
Warner saving 19th and 20th over for Abhishek and Samad?,3
If Trump wins the election I will change my flair to Sunrisers Hyderabad.,-5
"Rant  
  
That has to be some of the most braindead cricket I have ever seen. Why would you refuse a single if it gives you a chance to sit out the most dangerous bowler in the world, and with 4 wickets in hand? Just why?  
On that note, why would you eat a review up and take it away from the in-form batsman who is playing right now?  
On that note, why would you risk a shot as a captain who anchors the batting, while you have already gotten 13 runs from the over?  
On that note, why do I still support this shit team, when it has been 7 years since Gilchrist, the reason for me supporting this team in the first place, has left?  
  
Man emotional attachments hurt sometimes",38
Does cottrell salute after every run he scores?,9
"If am KL, i won't come to Captain's Interview.",6
Warner has a really great passion for this team.Its good to watch,8
So Rashid's bowling performance is not good enough for top 5 in fantasy?,5
Scenes if natarajan gets cotrell and salutes him,8
Only Stuart Binny could save KX now,3
LXIP as usual,3
Which position SRH will jump after this win?,2
Jonty is looking better with age,3
Wow never been this chill watching our game lmao,6
"And there was someone earlier saying this game wouldn’t help SRH’s NRR, lmao",9
The only thing that remains to be seen now is the Quantum of Loss ™,5
I mean i fucking said they'd ve 135 all out. C'mon lads dobt let me down.,5
Inb4 Cottrell does a Tewatia.,4
I think today's match has the worst over rate this IPL. 4 overs left and already 3 hour 47 minutes over,4
"Wow, the umpires are now not even following the protocol. 

No matter that the Batsman says I think they need to go forward with the concussion protocol. 

I know this innings has taken way too long, but such incompetency !! SMH!!",8
"Kxip slowly becoming a team who may not qualify for top 4 but might become party pooper for others.

They have enough quality in the side who without pressure may become mighty dangerous.",3
"Come on take those 2 wickets, don't drag it",2
Nattuuuu,6
What are the realistic chances of Kings XI making it to the top 4? Serious question.,2
"Other teams - Indian Premier League

SRH be like - Overseas Premier League

Considering how they are carried by their overseas players.",4
Yorker King strikes again.,7
Yes...Nattu.. finish them off..,6
"In an earlier match, Pant gave his wicket away to Rashid trying to slog when there were only two balls left in his spell. Same with Pooran today who was smarter and tried to defend. DD and KXIP would have won their respective matches had they played out Rashid in both instances. What a star Rashid is though!",7
Ah yesss,3
Cottrell has zero intent lol,2
Finish them off,6
Orgasmic yorker!,4
Everyone in k11 look so broken damn,3
Nattu is like : Saavadi,5
No spinner is even close to Rashid Khan in T20s.,6
Doesn't celebrate a tail ender's wicket. My bowler.,9
"Thangarasu ""Yorker"" Natarajan",6
"**16.2** Natarajan to Cottrell, OUT,  **132-9**

SS Cottrell  b Natarajan 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",4
T 'Mitch Starc' Nataranjan,4
Nattu Kaka is a good bowler also.,4
Bumrah who?,3
Nut 😫💦,4
Yorkerajan strikes.,5
Sexy Yorker!!,6
They've scored 6 runs in the last half hour wtf,5
Man of the Match Bairstow or Rashid ?,1
"You gotta admit, our bowling has come a long way even without bhuvi. If it wasn't for Samad's disaster, That's an incredible fielding and bowling effort for against a team with top 2 orange cap contenders",7
I think maybe SRH might win this one!,2
Cottrell looks so sad :(,5
I feel bad for Punjab.,1
Nattu yorker 💦,5
maybe Cortrell can learning bowling yorkers from Natrajan now,3
Bishnoi showing his hand to say I'm fine reminded me of that JoJo Rabbit scene where they Heil Hitler for like 50 times in a minute.,7
Cottrell looked like he might cry,6
I have a feeling that this is Cortrell last game,3
Natarajan is so good with those yorkers but what the fuck is that under jaw beard?,5
Credit goes to Warner for not holding back  his genuine bowlers and holding back the 5th bowler. Many other captains would have tried to bowl out Abhishek Sharma and panicked.,8
"I acc feel bad for KXIP

They all look so demoralised",1
Natarajan looks like he’ll have a long international career,1
Rashid Khan is an Afghanistani treasure. Protect him at all costs,5
r/Cricket one Kanos over away from Orgasm,5
Almost 4 hrs into the match and we are still 4 overs away from scheduled finish. Smh,5
Need to get shehbaz nadeem in as fifth bowler or maybe 3d,2
Gayle .,1
They should burn KXIP to the ground and do a complete reboot. Get Goenka's astrologer on board too.,2
My man Arshdeep was denied a first bump by Salute Man? 😭😭😂😂,3
Yaar Nattu is a lovely lovely man and a leftie quick with a normal action. what’s not to like.,5
What must Cottrell be telling to the incoming batsman lol,2
nuttin 4 nattu,3
Can teams play with less than 4 overseas player. Has any IPl team have done this yet?,6
I am already bored of the IPL,0
[removed],6
"India has been looking for a left arm pacer ...Can natarajan swing it as well , both ways ?",7
"So retain Warner and Rashid. Then RTM on Pandey, Natarajan and Bairstow?",5
You can take the boys out of RCB but you cannot take the RCB out of the boys.,21
"**WISDEN:** [What makes a good cricket coach?](https://wisden.com/almanack/What-makes-a-good-cricket-coach)

Man..how did holding off the 5th bowler payoff..I was thinking that would hurt them in the end... brilliant from rashid,7
My only sorrow from this ipl is that we found Natarajan too late. He's 29 now.,12
Wanna see natarajan do well,5
Fuck it. Time for these cunts to once again be pArtY pOoPeRs for the last 8 games.,5
Come on guys wicket now. We need the nnr,5
Nattu showing where Cottrell should have bowled to Tewatia,7
How is this going to affect both teams NRR??,3
"Need Nattu, Pooran, Washington Sundar and Nagarkoti in CSK😭",9
Rashid with the casual 12 runs given in 4 overs once again.,5
Wasn't Natarajan a part of KX in 2017 or 18?,1
"It might look like a lucky wicket but it was well set up by Rashid. 
First a string of fuller balls which Pooran happily defended. Then a shorter one, Pooran thought he could latch on to it, but got hurried by the speed, mishit it. 
Beautiful indeed.",9
Looks like the whole Punjab team need to take a break bcoz of Mental Health™ just like Maxi,4
I used to bat number 11 for my team. The worst experience was when the slip fielders started giggling when I asked the umpire for an off stump mark,21
Natarajan Yorkers are something. Damn.,8
Love nattu yorkers,3
Tewatia gonna score 100 tomorrow.,5
So looks like folks were wrong when they thought India would do better under Kumble than Shastri.,8
"Pros for Punjab : Arshadeep and Bishnoi are good finds. Pooran is back in form.

Cons : Everything else.",7
SRH will got to 3rd on the table over KKR with NRR?,7
Lol Arshdeep doesn't even swing the bat,3
Bumrah has to bowl 10 12 Yorkers per match to catch up to Natarajan on yorker count. 2020 right?,12
Nattu ❤️,13
fricckkk yess,8
Maxwell and Manish Pandey really need to pull the socks up or get replaced,6
BIG NRR PP for SRH,4
2018-19 Bumrah vibes from Natarajan,9
That's two games in a row that Punjab  have been utterly outplayed. They have such a good unit too.,9
RR gonna win tomorrow in Sharjah huh?,6
"Last 3 overs better be Kanos, Warner, Bairstow",4
"Yes, totally deserves a wicket. Good bowling Nat",6
5d move by srh to finish the match without finishing overs of 5th bowler,12

Imagine thinking that Rahul is India’s next captain... Iyer your time is coming!!!!,16
Do we need Shahbaz Nadeem in the team?,7
Interesting to see at the beginning of this season matches were coming down to the last over with highly INTENSE matches. Now as the season is progressing we are getting more blowouts. Why is this?,9
Despite being a SRH supporter I like Rahul and does not feel good looking his sad face. Pressure showing on him. Should have been better without captaincy.,30
I'm sure India selectors watching this IPL have concluded that KLRahul is the best option for next India captain,17
Fucking +0.2 Run Rate despite the middle order collapsing each game. I love to see it,8
"Pooran- 77(37)

Others- 55-9 (64)",26

"I'm going to have to call that the end of KXIP's knockout hopes. Yes, there is still time for a comeback but this team doesn't have any balance. They've lost games that they should have won easily. Their batting definitely has depth and potential but with a bowling attack that leaks runs, it's going to be very hard for them to progress in the tournament.",9
"Punjab looked a good team in intial matches but now they have lost their last three matches badly , they are still a strong unit but I guess they have beleifs or mental issues more",13
Good bowling Nattu now go shave off those pubes.,9
Feels good to finally win man.,7
Rashid Khan just might be the best LOI spinner since Murali.,9
What will Srh nrr be after this humongous Victory?,6
"First 15 overs in the match, no wickets.

Next 21.5 overs, 16 wickets.",37
That's an embarrassing scorecard for KXIP,9
WE'RE NUMBER 3 BOIIIIIS!!!,25
Warner's aggressive captaincy masterclass right here! we don't have a 5th bowler yet he went out all to choke pooran and kill this game,18
"holy cow, that NRR jump though for SRH",11
"Kane was in good touch today. Bairstow,Warner, Rashid and him are fixed positions. Need to bring that young left arm bowler who came in place of Bhuvi. Give him a game, he can be our 5rh bowler. Cant go like Today",10

Without Pooran this woulda been the biggest run margin win in IPL history",12
KXIP with 5 losses still has a far better NRR than RCB 🤦‍♂️,36

KXIP vs SRH : KXIP 132 all out. 

SRH >>>RCB.",17
Huuuuuge jump in NRR for both teams,11
69 run victory erects SRHs nrr,8
Kxip looked clueless,9
This was a NICE match.,8

Why tf only CSK matches getting advertised?,5

Look at KL's face man,10
"Only 2 overs went for the required run rate or more

Oof",8
"Well this chase fizzled out quickly. But still, I'd rather this than CSK where they lose because they preserved their wicket to the point where they batted themselves out of the chase. Memorable innings from Pooran. Rashid doing what he does. And SRH openers were great too.",16
"Finally some sanity in the points table, positive NRR teams in top 4, negative NRR in the bottom 4",18
Rahul looks absolutely shattered. Gotta feel bad for him.,17
69 runs! 69 hehehehe,11
Not much loyalty there by Kev for his ex Stars teammate.,5
Guys can you please stop making 69 jokes? Im using reddit through my mum's phone!,12
KXIP lost by 69 runs. Noice.,19
a tiny jump scare can make kl cry now,33
Damn.. KL looks depressed.,24
"Friendship with KXIP ended ❌

New best friend Delhi Capitals ✅",32

The only thing more one-sided than this ipl were my feelings for my crush growing up!!,12

Koach was right all along? /s,5
Whose nudes does Maxwell have to keep getting picked up for millions?,8
Lmao I always struggle to find a post match thread for SRH.,18
Srh still needs that 5th bowler,14

TIL Piyush Chawla is younger than Koach Kohli. My reality is shattered.,31
Brilliant from Warner to hold that 5th bowler,12
I feel for my boy Rahul,11
I really feel sad for punjab fans. They are not irritating like others but their team irritates everyone the most.,28
Literally no reason for dc to screw up anymore ...tmrw is a must win,3
"I really feel for KL Rahul, he's in this same position every match. These post match interviews must be tough when you're out of form.",15
"It's absolutely heart breaking to watch KL Rahul's interviews after KXIPs losses. 

He is (for my money) the best batsmen in IPL this year, and hopefully his team's poor performances does not have an impact on his batting.",19
4-1-12-3 is just ridiculous,25
"**Change of captaincy**, anyone?",1
I see samad making way for 3d shankar. An all-rounder would be a better option than a fast bowler considering their batting is fragile,18
KXIP needs to get over these heartbreaking losses in order to prevent more heartbreaking losses,23
Great captaincy with 4main bowlers,32

Is it Kings 11 the first team to get eliminated? I so wanted Rahul and Mayank to do well,20
"Oh man, Rashid was struggling to not break down when talking about Najeeb Tarakai",59
Rashid was almost stopping his tears while speaking about his friend and teamate Najeeb Tarakai,74
We've won the game by 69 runs and it still feels like a close match. All credits to Pooran.,54
KXIP are playing just like RCB. But are unable to win our hearts,42
"Rahul
Shami
Agarwal
Pooran
Neesham
Mujeeb

Deserve a better team! Lol",16

Sunny g blaming Mayank for the run out wtf,20
MI and DC are gonna stick in the top 4. Kings is also gonna stick at the bottom. The other 5 are gonna dance around like crazy,25
"**Most Consecutive Wins (While Defending 200+ target)**

Awww that shot of Warner and Kane hi fiving and falling over is cute af,50
MoM for YRKFA over YJB.,9
"Rahul reminds of Kohli last year, except Kohli never looked this sad even when he was batting like shit",53
"The Altroz is a horrible, horrible car to have centre-stage at a major sporting tournament",34
"Even when we are shit we give you memes and entertainment, sorry kxip",29
69 😁,8
"KL Rahul looks one of the most “dead inside” people to me. To be honest, the team playing so bad and also losing out on the close matches can do that to you.",39
Mah boi Warner trying to please south uncles with that moustache,68
Warner likes matches finishing early so that he can go back to watching cardoons.,42
SRH bought Natarajan for 40 lakh. Hope he gets at least 4cr for next auctions. He even has an academy in his village to encourage other financially struggling players like him. 4cr is not a big ask for someone like him when Unadkat could go for 11cr.,57
"SRH still have their weaknesses bare, that 5th bowler was gonna cost us the match and it can happen again",16
[deleted],32
I think it’s about time we see the Universe Boss back in action.,29
I like SRH. They punch above their weight. They are the only ones who have beaten DC so far which is a very impressive feat as we will learn by the end of the season.,37
Poor kings 11 have tried everything . Changed 7-8 captains . Changed 10 coaches . Bought many big players. Sometimes it just doesn’t come together and not meant to be,20
Vaughan on cricbuzz just said that  you can't have any stickers on your bat and come to bat at no. 7 . So apt for mujeeb,25
"Rashid is the only bowler which i can consider for exchange with Rabada. 

But its Rabada man, it’s such a joy to watch him bowl orthodox fast bowling. I will be mad if they make that exchange!",20
Tomorrow we prove to the world umpteenth time that we are here to win the competion.,12
"Man Delhi fans have become quite a bit arrogant, deservedly so I suppose!",31
[deleted],26
"I know whatever you gotta say in DC VS RR that DC is brilliant,exceptional and has Rabada,Nortje and Ashwin and Pant and Iyer and Stoinis but RR in Sharjah is another force they bat like on a different pitch they have 210+ scores there they are like Prime Australia right there no one can beat em in Sharjah they can destroy the most powerful team,Ask CSK and KXIP about RR in Sharjah.",0
