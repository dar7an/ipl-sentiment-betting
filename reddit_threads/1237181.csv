Good evening everyone. Let's goooo DC üî•üî•‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®,3
Best wishes to both teams.Let's have final to remember!,9
"I won't mind if Delhi wins, only hoping it's not a borefest like previous games between these two teams in this season. Show some fight DC.",1
Let's zoooo boys no heart attacks like last year just good cricket please.,4
"Looking at how league matches went, I'm pretty sure this will be a superb match. Hope we see some high quality cricket today. GLHF.",5
"I'll be happy if DC wins today. This team has struggled a lot in IPL over the years and I guess for the sake of **competitiveness** of IPL it'll be good if they win. 

I love the the way MI has dominated the IPL this year and I'll remember this MI side for a long time.

So yeah, just a win win for fans like me!!

PS- Wanna see Rohit and Pollard hit big today.",1
"2 din se goti muh me hai. On a serious note, very happy with how we have played. Hopefully its a great game",9
"Don't be boring, that's all",8
I'll be happy by whoever wins today. Mumbai supporter but Delhi is my favourite team and I was supporting them this tournament. So yayy let's go!,3
I'm so sad it's the end of IPL and I'll have to socialize with my family from tomorrow.,12
"Literally had 3 dreams/nightmares with 3 different outcomes already. All owing up to this date, 12 years of support Letzgooo boys",5
"The most 2020 thing that could happen was Mumbai winning in an even year or Delhi winning. 

2020 has given us both possibilities.",10
"To hell with the Toss, I predict Mumbai is batting first.",4
Absolute scenes if DC trashes the fuck outta MI,21
Bumrah is either gonna get 4 wickets or be thrashed for 45 runs,5
Is Trent Boult fit to play today?,2
[deleted],2
"So, is it the Mumbai Indians as in Indians or Mumbai Indians as in Indians?",5
If Pant performs today all will be forgiven for his absolutely horrible season,6
Ahh shit here we go again.. Yet another Final with Mumbai.. Aren't they bored man.,-3
DC HAVE to bat first,13
"Last time I was this early, Delhi hadn't even begun their 4 match losing streak",8
[deleted],6
Winning the IPL final is a lot like the eating of an orange,1
"Lmao what is scary is that next year the Mumbai team is going to be even stronger with Malinga in for NCN and with Pandya fit to bowl. The bowling apart from Boult and Bumrah is the weakness if any for Mumbai right now. Even that is plugged in next year. And it's an odd year to add to that. Mumbai have already won IPL 2021, so DC you gotta do it today!",42
"Hope Delhi wins so we get a new winner 

But we all know inside that Mumbai are gonna win. And that feeing fucking sucks",6
"Who was lift the trophy

Rohit  üíôüíô üí•üí•üí•üí•üí• Like

Shreyas comment",-14
DC win- Ponting is the GOAT                                                              DC lose- Iyer is a fucking donkey,119
"I really want this to go to the last ball

Will make things more interesting",2
"So, Rabada (29w) is 4 wickets away to surpass Dwayne Bravo's record for most number of wickets (32w) in a single IPL season.",9
Pant pls make a match winning 100(24)* today.,33
[deleted],-10
Viral Kohli... more like Virile Kohli amirite! üòè,2
"Even though I'm supporting DC, I hope Boult plays today. Need the best quality cricket.",8
"Shitman will choke today too!

# #ViratArmy #Viratians",-29
[SRH's last dressing room speech legit feels like an end of a movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImmqyWuBSPY),3
"While everybody is posting their hypothesis here's mine

1. The last time IPL was entitely conducted outside India, a team called DC won
2. For a team named DC, they won their title in the second season(considering this is the second season after DC renamed themselves)

Edit: so congrats MI coz these fucks never work. We were told we will reach finals coZ RCB changed their logo.",8
I like this idea of players from IPL giving comments for the Final. Kohli or Dhoni giving their opinions would have been *spicy*,2
[removed],50
"If Mumbai win the toss, I think we're gonna see a repeat of 2011 Final",6
"I think Mumbai will be happy regardless of the outcome of toss. They are better at chasing since if Boult and Bumrah don't fire then the other team can easily chase their score down. However, if they bat first then the scoreboard pressure will be tough on Delhi and we know how that goes.",3
Today‚Äôs the day boys. Happy to be here! Hope we get a good competitive game,6
Attitude of iyer has led delhi to downfall he bats with so much confidence,-2
"While everybody is posting their hypothesis here's mine - 

1. The last time I had an accident in my pants - it was the 56th match of this IPL - which MI lost by 10 wickets. And 10 minutes ago too I shat my pants.

In conclusion - DC is winning today boys.",13
No amount of reverse jinxing seems to work on this MI side. What even.,20
"I want to watch this match as a neutral and enjoy, but its so hard not to pick a side subconsciously",8
All right Bois getting ready for another 100 run or 10 wicket defeat,4
Although I understand the situation bit sad this match isn't happening in Mumbai. Would have loved to finally see Mumbai playing final at Wankhede,2
Maybe the *real* IPL 2020 was the friends we made along the way.,26
[deleted],-5
MI have been insanely lucky with the toss this year and have got the opp to bat first in key situations. Really hope DC bat first today get a total on the board and make MI chase 180 plus. It‚Äôs the only way they can win,6
"Mumbai gonna steamroll us, they bat first and score 220+ or they Bowl first and our scorecard barely touches 100. Rohit and Ishan gonna do something special today",4
Praying for a competitive final,9
"Fun fact: MI hasn't beaten anyone more than twice in the IPL except DC. 


KKR already rejoicing.",5
Hi guys ready for the thriller,2
Whatever the result I hope Brohit appears today,1
"DC, bat first and seal the game :)",4
Inb4 Virender Sehwag comes opening with 2012 DD jersey,5
"They played the Lakshay song over Delhi's highlights and I got emotional. 13 years, Its been sooo long. I am so so happy we've such a competent team.",3
My Delhi bro‚Äôs I‚Äôm just so happy we made it here after all these years. Hope our team brings their A game today. Roar Macha boys it‚Äôs hype season!,3
"Okay can I just kindly ask all DC and MI fans to stop trying to reverse Jinx themselves?

 I'm tired of seeing ""we are so fucked _they_ are going to thrash us oh no""",6
"I am a bit worried, GMR takes back control from the next season. JSW has been fantastic, hopefully they work something out with GMR",18
Wonder how many runs Choker Kohli will score today,-20
"Whoever wins guys, hope for a cracker of a match.",3
expecting some fireworks from Rohit sharma today. I hope he shows his class in today's match.,1
It's quite a conundrum when you want Delhi to win but for Bumrah to rip through the batting lineup. I just love that guy. Why isn't he in Delhi...,4
"DC vs MI

*MI wins*

**IS THAT? WAIT A MINUTE! BAAH GODDD THAT'S MS DHONI WITH A STEEL CHAIR!**",4
The bio bubble environment has been successful. Great to see all player fit.,6
the Indian test squad is in uae or back in india practicing ?,1
DC- Gabhrana nahi hai.,1
"Yo Last year for DC to win it, next year GMR(their old owners) Are gonna take the ownership from JSW for 2 years.


That means they are going to release all of Shaw,Pant, Iyer this year !",7
[removed],-10
Ashwin to get QDK today. Feeling like a Brohit day.,2
Abbe yeh Sunny G kitna biased hai,6
"I need Pant to come to form today. If he does, game on!",2
Sunny G hates SRH to the sun's core,4
"If Stoinis wins DC the match, this will be second time in three years that an Australian batting-allrounder who bowls seam and usually opens wins their team the IPL in his first with them after leaving RCB.

Morris will open next year if this happens, wouldn't he?",2
Sad to see that the _real_ cricket ends today and then it's back to those boring 5-day snoozefests üò¥üò¥,-9
"The madlads at BCCI did it, they held the IPL without any major fuckups",185
Kids want a high scoring thriller. Adults want a low scoring thriller. Legends know it's gonna be both in the same match.,24
"Brohit playing his 200th IPL game today, woahüî•",6
MI fans trying to jinx or reverse jinx is the stupidest thing.,53
It's everybody vs MI. Everyone is a DC fan today except the MI fans.,4
DC for the win!,1
"No flair for today not cuz my team was eliminated, but because MI and DC are my 2 teams. Suffering from success",4
Hoping for a very competitive final. Last year's final was a treat to watch.,2
"Dont mind me, I'm just here for Pant's redemption arc",5
[removed],1
"The only way dc is gonna have any chance is by surprising mumbai. So heres my theory
Drop rahane for shaw and bring harshal for dubey

Open with shaw if he gets runs it will be enough if not stoinus comes in and inclusion of harshal patel will increase our batting so that we can afford a walking wicket",0
"El boulto is fit , looking forward to him and Bumrah causing havoc",3
Bois what are we gonna do in these two weeks before the Australia series?,2
"I want DC to win but then people will intentionally start roasting RCB 

But if MI wins, they would have a 2 trophy lead against CSK",5

"If DC wins, what will happen to r/cricket?",2
Want to see Boult going for runs today. Why do we Indians suck so bad against left arm swing bowling?,-4
[deleted],5
"How many ""Sacrifices"" Punter will make to win this cup?",7
Ponting is equipping all the DC batsman with his spring ping pong  bats. M Indians will be in big trouble!,2
"I am okay with SG being biased provided he leaves it to the pre match discussion and doesn‚Äôt carry it to comm box. 

Even if DC win, I can foresee a few mentions of Mumbai Lad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Shreyas Iyer being the one to lead them to their first title.",3
"mi will bat first and dc will get quick wickets and look set to bundle mi for less than 120, before pollard comes and makes a quick 50 and turns the tables",3
I am sick of reverse jinxing. Today I am going to be positive,1
I really want people to understand that Iyer isn't a great captain even if he wins today. He was literally carried by his teammates to the final,2
BCCI should seriously consider neutral commentators for IPL. Sunil Gavaskar can't stop with his Mumbai agenda,3
Ponting is a live example of how mediocre players become shitty coaches.,-14
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",12
I hope we‚Äôre batting first again today.,0
I understand DC fans reverse jinxing but why the fuck are MI fans reverse jinxing? You guys are fucking favourites and u have a pretty strong team even on paper compared to DC,32
[deleted],7
This season's commentry has been decent. Guess why? No manjrekar or chopra,0
"No fucking way. Star Sports Hindi just compared Pollard, Hardik and Krunal to PPE Kit lmao",7
"Mumbai has lost every Final(1) while chasing 

and won every final(4) while defending 

What's it gonna be today xD",6
"Sources say a set of 15 bats arrived at the DC camp yesterday. DC Coach Ricky Ponting tested all those bats personally; by hitting a few balls casually which practically flew to the boundary. After a satisfactory testing session, Ponting was seen smiling and my mouth-reading expert was able to decipher ""Spring Bats"" and ""2003 WC Final"" from a few sentences he spoke to Kaif.",168
I'm sure star sports and this lame anchor Sunil will find a way to put super V and thala shit in the pre show,5
Ponting imbibed a winning mentality in MI that was languid in Sachin's shit leadership. Maybe he can end what he started then today.,2
Is the toss decided?,2
Either Pant or Rohit will score big today and their whole bad tournament will be forgotten because of that knock.,6
"Had this format existed in the first few years of the IPL, then Delhi could have had a few titles. I remember they finished in the top 2 a few times and then were sent packing in the SF.",3
"Question to Mumbai fans: Do y'all even feel nervousness for the finals anymore? I know y'all can lose today, but you still have 4 fucking trophies and guess what, the next year is an odd one and Malinga is coming back for NCN and Pandya will get fit to bowl. You are guaranteed to win next year, so please let us win this year.",9
Almost time to find out if we remain in our exclusive club with RCB and KXIP or if we finally break free and join everybody else.,3
"Ideal DC batting line-up for today:

Stoinis

Dhawan

Ponting 

Hetmyer

Kaif

Axar",8
"Atleast we don't have SRH fans reverse jinxing the hell out, today üôè.",11
MI has a team good enough to win the world cup,73
Ponting and final . PTSD triggered !,2
Is Boult fit?,1
"kohli has more intl 100s than the whole mi squad, just shows that intl performances dont really matter in IPL since mi has been the best side so far",8
"Go MI! Screw all those random logics of having more IPL cups, we need inequality there",4
"Im from Bangalore. All my friends here ---

Rohit is the best IPL captain.
Dhoni stands second.
RCB has the largest fanbase.",10
"Ah, a match thread where both fanbases speak their minds and not hide behind reverse jinx like little kids! Good luck boys!",10
Cringe SG,2
"All these Days, MI have been using their name to emotionally connect to **Indians** to gain support.


But Delhi **Capitals** is here to show them who's the *boss*",4
"Sunny G and Aakash Chopra together-


r/cricket- you fucking donkeys",20
The decision to play jayant yadav will be important for MI. both krunal and chahar are bad against left handed batsman. But I don't think they will change their team.,2
"Pant special today , I can sense it",1
Steyn is giving his analysis for the final? interesting.,4
Steyn will probably join dugout next season.,7
What the fuck is this song lmao,5
"I swear that Tridev Reel by Dhawan, Pant legit was vibing as KumbhKaran",3
If Delhi bat first and are at 40-1 after the power play then they have a serious chance in this game . If they lose power play wickets then they are in deep trouble,3
Jeez imagine if MI had Malinga this season with Boult and Bumrah.,6
"From Cricbuzz
>Breaking: Hardik Pandya has just confirmed in an interview with IPLT20 that Trent Boult is fit and will play.",11
They probably saw the Rasode video on instagram and decided to make a similar one lmao,3
TRENT BOULT IS PLAYING,7
I am thinking there is a real chance here for a fierce rivalry to start.,5
Lessss go MI take that cup,1
I just hope it won't be a one sided game,2
"If you win the toss can you choose to make other team make the decision ?

In some sports you can",2
Don't care who wins just want a tight match. Good luck to us both!,3
Boult express in the game. Phew,1
[deleted],14
Go Delhi Super Kings! You deserve your maiden title today!,2
"From CricJizz -
> DC is resting Pant because of a wrist-related injury to the left-handed batsman. Naked photos of Stoinis were also found in his kit bag.",5
Major RPSG vs MI vibes today,3
"/u/MotaBhai_Official Hopefully you have prepared the perfect script for today with enough twist and turns. But remember, Hero has to win :P",4
I would prefer Shaw as the floater instead of Rahane as the floater tbvh,1
"Trent Boult is playing. Congratulations MI, hopefully we give you a good fight today on the way to your trophy.",4
I know we have a great team but I'm bloody nervous.,3
Trent Boult is fit and will play today! Yes!!,5
"DC will be bring balance to the Force, by not allowing MI to win in an even year.",4
I don't want MI to win but I also don't want DC to exit the pantheon of meme teams and leave KXIP and RCB alone :(,47
Let's see which Mumbai boy gets his hand on the coveted trophy!,2
"Can we get a super over, please?",3
It's literally MI fans vs all IPL team fans. If MI won again it would be least enjoyed ipl final victory. MI was too strong the whole tournament and an complete auction is the only way to destroy there form.,3
I'm anxious af!,5
IPL is finally coming to an end and the quality of the posts on this sub will be greatly improved now. Looking forward to some _actual_ shitposting as the Aussie tour begins.,-1

Big big toss for DC to win! Ponting always believed in bat first in knockout games...,2
">Mumbai has lost every Final(1) while chasing

>and won every final(4) while defending

>

God-damn, fucking shit",11
Both team's will be happy I guess for toss,3
Alright...that's the game. Never won a final batting second. Uwu uwu Delhi!,6
Early wickets will be the key. Let‚Äôs go Boult + Bumrah!!,5
"DC batting first might look good for them at first because they suck at chasing.

But then you realise the opposition is MI lol who are experts at chasing.",2
"Feel for Lamichhane, was sure that he would get multiple games here on the slow pitches before the tourney started",5
Mumbai has been unlucky with the toss this tournament,4
2010.exe is loading. ETA 4 hours.,5
Rohit's cool,4
Got bless us with Brohit today and I won't ask you ever for anything.,5
We are done. We cant chase shit. Congratulations DC,0
Iyer: We'll ü¶á,11
I‚Äôm gonna miss this year‚Äôs IPL the most :(,4
Chasing is going to be a daunting task. But we do have the batting unit to try and chase any total. This game will be huge!,3
"So is it going to be ""Ponting/Mahela is the GOAT"" or ""Shreyas/Rohit is a horrid captain""",6
Chalo at least pehli inning me hi to bahaar nahi honge.,4
Rohit looks like he has lost some weight,2
Mumbai's all wins so far have been defending the total. Twist in the tale today?,1
I feel it was a good toss to loose,3
Lol Rohit ‚Äúconfused‚Äù‚Äî mind games started already,4
"Rohit ‚ÄúTo be honest was confused on what to do so good I lost the toss‚Äù

"DC won the toss and are batting first

Same team for DC

Jayant yadav for Chahar",3
Lets go boult bumrah,2
Wow that's an interesting move to bring Jayant Freaking Yadav in the final.,3
"Butterflies in the stomach. Ponting's team winning the toss and batting first. Early wickets a must, not to allow DC to settle and set a big target.",4
"Rahul Chahar misses. Wow, that's a big gamble.",3
I WILL TALK LIKE MURALI KARTHIK TODAY I AM HYPED,3
4 left handers so no leg spinner,3
"I'm happy with toss..

Either it's sets us up well to win this.

Or we have an epic collapse and the match ends quickly and the pain is not prolonged.

Win win I guess.",5
Leg spinner for a left handed batsman.... Bad Idea,6
"Jeez Karthik calm your tits, you‚Äôre shouting into a mic",3
Jayant the x factor,2
"If Stoin plays well today again, I am really worried that Shaw is gonna warm the bench the whole next season. He has been horrible but he is pretty young all memes aside and when fires has won us games",1
Rahul Chahar out for Jayant Yadav,3
WTF no Rahul Chahar?,4
Why is Steyn there as if he's retired lmao,4
It seems which ever team I support this ipl goes down. Fuck it! Go MI!,4
Lost the only final we have chased in but hopefully we won't fuck with Pollard's position this time and send up somebody like Harbhajan up the order,2
Rahul Chahar missing out? Genuinely very surprised,3
"Good move imo

Copying my comment from other thread: Just read article on Cricbuzz that Chahar has ER of more than 8.6 vs Left hander, DC has 4 Left handers in their top 7 plus even Stoinis smashed him in last game, Jayant Yadav did well in that DC game, I wonder whether they will play him in Final. Even Krunal struggles against left handers, if Dhawan survives first few overs and Pant/Hetmyer joins him in middle orders it could get really tough for us to stop the runs. Even Nadeem got smashed in last game.",7
Make Iyyer the only toss captain of India,9
Neroli is looking amazing,2
"Schr√∂dinger Steyn 

A player and a analyser too",5
"Wow. No Rahul and Jayant in 
Plus we have NCN. Who hasn‚Äôt played many matches. 
Weird for a team who had such a strong fix 11",5
Rohit was looking more nervous at the toss. Iyer looked quite cool.,-3
"WTF is this , in qualifier 1 everyone was like MI batting first so they dead, and now bam bam capitals batting first so hurray.

Jinx the heck out of it, but Dc top-order are walking wickets for MI. Man, common Mi havent loss a match chasing in this IPl other than the superover against RCB...2010 was a shitshow forget its a decade ago bois...",-6
"I don't know, I think we're gonna see someone cunt Jayant Yadav into retirement today",4
"DC has won the toss, early signs of their loss. They have lost the most when they won the toss",3
"nice DC play best when they are defending

and MI have dew on their side when they chase

game on",2

why would you drop the spinner that's done the best for you for the whole tournament in the finals?,4
As MI fan I feel relieved they are chasing that batting depth might helpful today.,4
Dale Steyn looks handsome,1
kind of happy that MI's batting first. Lol I don't want them to collapse at 120-130 in the finals again.,-5

Damn jayant yadav decision is brave,5
SunnyG looking like a snacc out there,4
I want Rohit Sharma and Iyer to play well. Both are due for a good innings.,7
The best chance for Delhi to win will have is to chase. Looking at this Mumbai team I don‚Äôt think there is any score they can‚Äôt chase.,2
wtf so unlike MI to make a change in such a big game,7
That song is so cringe,5
"Delhi have to go 175 plus, that's there's only chance.",4
So Rohit let Chahar lead the team off the field because DC finished his IPL! And folks thought they were backing him lmao!!,11
" Mumbai has never won an IPL final chasing.

Infact the only final they chased they lost in 2010.

Got to be a massive boost for Delhi",6
How many left handers DC have?,1
Ashwin dancing like my 65yo aunt at a wedding,6
Shikhar is an amazing entertainer,2
Anyone who unironically claims 'feminism is not needed anymore' just needs to take a look at the comments on any social media whenever a female presenter shows up. Every fucking time. And it's  disgusting.,3
Rohit doesn't trust Chahar to bowl wrong 'uns?,1
"Feel bad for Chahar, but I don't mind the Jayant Yadav inclusion. Good to see Boult is fit. Would have batted too I think; hopefully can get some wickets up top and restrict them.",2
MI vs DC: Winner would be crowned with the ‚ÄúMost absurd and stupid team name‚Äù title.,5
DC is going to be heavily reliant on Dhawan's start again today... Pant has to come good later in the innings.,2
Jayant Yadav might just do well coz DC has 4 lefties. But what if it doesn't ??  SMH my anxiety is overflowing.,2
Is Shreyas In test team for India?,-1
Dhawan is a rockstar,2
Let's fucking go lads,2
"Wtf is MI trying to do?  Top 7 already forms a batting juggernaut. Ncn for pattinson bcoz Ncn can bat a bit. 

Jayant yadav in for same reason?",2
"Mumbai fans, would you really be sad losing to this Delhi team, I mean, just look at Dhawan ‚ù§Ô∏è",3
"Jayant in because of the lefties in Delhi

Dhawan Pant Hetmyer Axar",2
"""damn, I really like murali Karthik""

Said no one ever",15
Iyer's impression of Stoinis forgives that horrendous performance in that Ad,2
I don't know what score we can put up on the board that Mumbai CANNOT chase lol. 200+ is not safe enough for me,6
HETMYER HAS TO BAT AT 3,2
i would've wanted DC to chase. Batting first against MI is a huge gamble. If they won't score above 180+ they're sure to lose. I hope DC pulls this off and we can finally have a new winner.,5
"Jayant Yadav?

Ain't that the dude contesting in the Bihar elections rn??",3
Dale steyn looking like me in my online class,2
"- If DC wins :

Great! A new champion! MI domination even in even years has been denied.

>I'm playing both sides, so that I always come out on top.",6
"DC has a very special camaraderie amongst themselves. That‚Äôs like the one team I‚Äôd love to have a pint with. For the sake of more celebratory Dhawan videos, I hope DC lifts the cup.",4

170 +and its  DC's game to loose,4
"Also Stoin had taken Chahar for the cleaners, the only bowler which we could score of against in Q1. So makes even more sense.",5
DC are fucking stupid for going in with so many spinners against MI,1
Seriously. Chahar isn‚Äôt that good. Probably the weakest frontline spinner among the 8 teams. He hasn‚Äôt cemented his place in the XI. Rohit is definitely right to drop him.,2
Damn I thought the Jayant thing was just mind games. They actually did it,3
I‚Äôm fucking nervous we are going to fuck this up. DC fans how are you guys feeling?,10

Just open with Rahane and Dhawan. If the 2 play really well, send Stoinis at 3. If one of them gets out in the first 6 overs, Iyer at 3.",1

Archer was great this season but I don't think he should win MVP. Hopefully they do the sensible thing and give Rabada/Bumrah the award even if they end up with fewer 'MVP points' (or whatever that is) than him.,0

I can't remember the last match where Boult opened the bowling and did not take wickets in the powerplay.,3
Lol. If Mumbai get Dhawan early they can restrict DC below 150.,1

Opening with stoin against Boult Bumrah 

Not a good idea",13

How many wickets for Bumrah so far?,1
Well gambhir curse is still relevant xD,6
Why the hell is Dhawan not opening against Boult??? What part of the last *3* times the right-hander has been embarrassed by Boult made Ponting think this time would be different. Absolutely shambolic,6
A giant Trent Boult looks like it is taking a shit on the stadium.,3
Have to face Bumrah now... out of the frying pan and into the fire.,7
I‚Äôm fine with losing to MI as long as we don‚Äôt get all out for an embarrassingly low total. Deep inside we knew this even before the game.,5
How many times have DC lost a wicket in the first over or below 10 runs this season?,4
"What a massive wicket. Was a little worried about Stoinis, he's done surprisingly well this IPL. 

Trent you beauty üòç",0
"Shreyas' imitation of Stoinis caused his confidence to drop and thus, he lost his wicket first ball. Bad captaincy smh",9
Imagine benching boulty. Absolute bonkers of a decision. Ponting is shit. Don't @ me,4
Good guy Stoinis didn't get out to Bumrah today.,10
Ponting's team batting 1st in a final. Decent 1st over. *PTSD intensifies*,9
Dhawan needs to be in the entire match for a chance. Pant and Iyer have to... Oh who an I kidding.,3
Ah tuned in a bit late and thought it was smart to open with Rahane to counter Boult but then realized what happened,8
Gambhir. Altroz player of the tournament.,1

Wait I missed the first over. Who got out,5
"Honestly guys, Gambhir's powers are unreal. I don't think I've seen anyone jinxing this correctly. And this happened throughout the tournament.",9
Remember that Stoinis' was the only batsman who got going against MI in the first qualifier.,6
Rahane: Why do I hear boss music?,10
Loved watching an aussie shit the bed in the final. Dream come true.,7

Dhawan needs 67 today for orange cap,2
Luck with Dhawan today again? Hundred on the cards,3
Can DC at least get to 160-170?,5
40-47 in powerplay would be good for delhi from here,3
Rahane gonna play crucial innings fir delhi today,3
Perfectly played. Safe shot,4

Damnnnn that was close,4
That should have been gone,2
Two of the best players actually that you could ask for in this situation,3
How/why does Dhawan find Bumrah tough to handle? He faces him nearly daily in the nets for like 7 out of 12 months annually,1
Neither Dhawan nor cameraman had any idea what tf just happened,6

Boult and Boomrah are all over DC.",1
Bumrah over 3 heart in mouth moments.,6
Dhawan century confirmed.,1
Bumrah deserved a wicket in this over.,3
Bumrah and Boult are near unplayable. You basically have to go run a ball and try not to lose any wickets in the first 4 or so overs,7
Good start from last time,1
Is this an r/cricket vs MI match?,105
Mi is the only team where you have to play like surviving first spell like test opening spell,4
Has anyone noticed how good it feels when the fucking fake crowd sound is completely turned off.,6
Ok just tuning into match. Was the first wicket off a peach or a batsman mistake?,4

People started reading patterns so much that in B4 someone points out even DC in 2009 had their opener gone for a duck(gilly),6

The last time my team won any final was in 2011. When India won the WC. Supported NZ in 2015 and 2019 wc. KXIP and DC in IPL. Anyone else who has done worse than this? Make me feel better please,7
If Pant doesn't show up for his team today after a below average season then I don't know what to expect from him,1
What's the point of a long ass tournament if MI is going to win regardless? Just for showing cringy ads?,10

Reminds me of Ind vs Pakistan in ct 2017 and Ind vs Nz in World Cup 2019,2

What is this shit shot from Iyer moving away,1
Why is Iyer attacking boult,2
Iyer dancing around the crease..,1
Iyer for fucks sake stop attacking their best bowler rn,3
Mumbai is the Mercedes of cricket and Delhi is similar to Redbull. Whereas CSK is the Ferrari which underperformed terribly this season. I can guess how this season ends!,0
Dhawan loves sweeping so much he plays Street Cleaning Simulator in his downtime.,5

DC at least have to get to 160 and then bowl and field like their life depended on it.,2
Delhi dont shit the bed please ...srh were good and rcb mi encounter would have had masala mixed to it.,3
This stupid dancing in the crease to fool the bowler has never worked for Iyer,4
Iyer just wants to take on our best powerplay bowler. What is he even thinking?,2
What the actual fuck Iyer?,1
Is Iyer playing Garba? What was that dancing on the crease? Lmao,4
Man I just can't stand this monopoly... Scriptwriters disappointed us after giving so many twists..,9
Mumbai are just the complete T20 team when you look around the domestic leagues. Got it all.,2
Shreyas showed no intent for the entire fucking tourney and he decides to show it against fucking Boult when we are 3 down in 5,3
"If CSK had the form they had last year, this would have been a far more interesting tournament.",2

"I'd have looked for a right hander in the batting lineup.

WTF is the commentator saying? They're 3 down and this is not a selection drill, not a lot of batsman left that can handle pressure. Just stick with your lineup...",1
"Giving 3rd over to Boult is a good decision with the start he got as always. Given his groin injury if there is some issue later on , you got at least 3 of his overs.",2
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Mumbai are a quality team, but so many players make errors against them they don‚Äôt always make against other teams. It feels like they show up expecting to get beaten, and the mental side of their game gets affected as a result.",11
Commentator -This approach from Iyer might bring boult his third wicket because he has two wickets already .,8
has anyone tried inhaling the air in delhi really deep to get high? Coz I'm about to try,4
Oye stop trying to slog when you are 3 down in the 5th over,4

maybe they'll prove me wrong",3
"MI has built an aura around them like the WI team of late 70's/80's and AUS team of late 90's/00's.

Their dominance and brushing away opposition with ease on their way to multiple titles is similar to those GOAT teams above.",8

"DC backed Iyer and Pant, they have to win us this game.",2

Pant needs to do for DC what SKY or Pandya does for MI.,1
DC's biggest mistake this season was letting Boult go last season.,4
Oh MI why the fuk u keep urself in danger of playing Pant all 15 overs. If at all Pant stays next 15 overs brace for a super over or an MI loss,-2

"
In the absence of Kohli after Ist test, KL can play in middle-order, right? I don't think he should be tried as opener in Australia anytime soon though.",3
Pant is broken. His natural game has been tempered with and I don't have any hopes for a Pant show today.,7
This year Pant scored 50 ?,3
"As per my memory, mumbai is the only team to often have a short cover. Am I correct?",2
DC really likes living on the edge don't they?,2
Great effort ~~vada pav~~ half biriyani boi,6

Iyer stop giving me hope yaar,3
Aww man Delhi wtf,2

Iyer is making Pant run like hell. Pant is gonna start hitting lol,10
A completely orthodox Jayant at one end and unorthodox kruunal at other,6
Some would say that this is a good innings from Shreyas so far. I disagree. It's been fraught with risks and he has been lucky af.,3
Binga and Boult have got such smol chins.,4
I guess this is the first time pant has ran so much üòÇ,8
"Decent by Pant so far, looks pretty safe unlike lappebaaz Iyer",7
They're giving way too much respect to Jayant and Krunal,8
Should introduce Pollard. 2 spinners against a seemingly set Iyer is dangerous and Jayant‚Äôs 2 overs should be saved for when Hetmyer comes,6
Match is becoming boring do something ._.,2
Cunt em,1
Just realised Boom has bowled only 1 over,3
Pretty good recovery. Gotta accelerate now though if we want to have a chance to win this,3

"Pant looks like that kid who was selected for the school play because he danced well in spite of his weight, but now on the day of the performance he realises his costume is too tight so he just awkwardly moves around because he's conscious of how he looks but that makes him look even more awkward and it's a shit show all round",-1
Bc who even gives roles to Bobby Deol now,2
Dugout fans should check out this 'No Context Select Dugout' account [https://twitter.com/OfDugout](https://twitter.com/OfDugout),5
I want to see ONE Pant sweeping six for old times sake,7
Pant does not have the mental strength to succeed at the highest level. he is letting all external factors affect him. he must be googling his name every day.,4
Yay govinda dance,5
"Good recovery atm, if they can get to 80/3 after 12 overs they should get a fighting score atleast.",6
Wicket incoming.,1
"If MI wickets doesn't fall early, then this will be the most boring IPL final with the same boring result.",10
[deleted],28
DC have to get to 160-170 from here,2
Waiting for spring bat miracles ‚ú®,1
They should try to hit at least one boundary then stick with those singles and doubles Williamson was a perfect example last match,4
This Shreyas Iyer cameo is exactly what India need when 5/3,15
"Look at this RCB innings, wonder if they'll run more 2s than Kohli did in that one match",5

"DC, you eliminated our favourite teams. Please put up a good show in the finals. Don't disappoint us.

\- Me (claiming to talk for SRH, RCB, KKR, KXIP, CSK and RR fans)",10
No Pommie you are saying Delhi have lost the game. Just accept it.,2
170 will be tough to chase in final,3
"Need to chip in one over of Pollard (for NCN/Krunal) somewhere when a wicket falls, maybe around 12th over, after that Bumrah over.",2
"DC can get to 180 if one of Iyer or Pant stays upto 15,16th over. 160+ would be chalenging for MI considering Sharma is out of form and kishan might be injured.",2
Ah yes Yes Bank's business loan for 1 crore. Fuck off,2
"Yes Bank ads are like there stocks , fucking depressing",1
Top tier running.,2
"If there was some redemption arc for Pant mainly and Iyer to make a point, you don't get a bigger stage than this...",3
"Mumbai team is just too OP

What has been most heartening for me this season is the fact that we are fighting to still stay in the game. DD used to just succumb to the situation but atleast we fight from there,5
Ok recovery period,1

The dude wearing the blue velvet jacket with mohanlal is sunny Varkey. The og mallu edtech billionaire and the founder of gems schools. dudes iced out richard Mille is baller af.,4
The game is going to end with MI parading the trophy and Punter chasing Dhawan and co around with his spring bat to spank them.,8
Ponting smiling üò≥,6
Imagine Pant running between the wickets as if he's in SRH. I didn't know he had it in him.,8
"If this pair adds another 30 and sticks until 14th over, Hetmeter can take it from there.",1
Pant is grasping his breath after 2 runs lol,2
South Indians did y'all see mohanlal?,6

Ok pant playing like his old self again I am hard now as an indian,8
Okay Pant is shifting gears. I'm a little worried.,5

Ohkay ab thoda fatne laga hai,6
"Fucking finally

This is the Pant that I love, this is the Pant that got into the India team",5
Just received word. RCB are cashing in their money in the bank. The match will now be a Triple Threat T20.,5
Pant was keeping all this batting inside him all this time,2
"Vadapav (laughing): You can't get Pant into form for the final

Ponting (looking at r/cricket): I know, but he can",9
Come on Panty boy.. make this your night to remember..,5

What exactly is Krunal Pandya‚Äôs role ?other than being Hardik‚Äôs brother.,9
"Msd shat the bed for most of 11' cwc but scored an important knock of 90 in the final, can pant do a dhoni as well?",6
Ugly delivery,2
Pant has ponting's spring bat!,6
Will Krunal bowl his famous bouncer now? :D,5
2018 pant ü§î I guess bumrah will come in to take his wicket,5
"No other team in this season with this kind of horrible start would have made 75 in 10 overs. Regardless of what happens, delhi deserve to be in the finals with MI.",6
Nothing more therapeutic than seeing Krunal getting smashed around the park,1
Sorry but it's so satisfying seeing KP get whacked,5
Mad Max Pant Hype,2

Rishabh‚Äôs Panting,4
Lyon v/s Pant flashbacks from the Sydney test. On-song Pant is a delight.,5
Oh boi happy to see Pant striking. Hope Shreyas provides good support and has the *captian talk* with Pant,6

Why does Krunal have shit eating grin all the time!!!,6
"I really want this both to perform thier best for DC today, they were the reason DC performed so well those two years.",2

Time to finish Krunal's sorry excuse for a career.,2
Pant's gonna absolutely cunt bumrah now,2
"Good counterattack. Few good overs of ""cautious aggression"" and MI will start panicking like headless chickens. It is the Grand Finale ffs, even MI is under the stress of not fucking this up, just like DC.",3

This over should have been by Pollard,2
Pant üòç,6
"well then

looking at about 170-180

tough ask from Mumbai to chase that in the finals

letting Boults and bumrahs and yadavs hard work to go to waste",3
Wont even complain if pant masterclass defeats us.,11
"Idc who wins or loses today, I don't want us to be humiliated in Australia. Pant can fire all he wants, go bby",5
As an MI fan I am terrified to see  peak Pant returning.,7
HAVE TO SURVIVE THIS OVER AT ANY COST,14
Damn they really brought in Boom for Pantsy,6
DC should target 160 for now and 170+ if they maintain momentum and don't  lose a wicket in 4 overs.,8
Actually punter is playing with rishabs mask . Thats why pant is smiling wearing pointings mask.,9
Rohit has gone into panik mode?,8
Wow this Pant guy can smash sixes all over. The next Manvinder Bisla.,7
"I told my parents (who are die-hard MI fans since 2008 courtesy of Sachin) that Rishabh Pant has been utter garbage this season. He has his 1 good inning due which can happen today.

Play Bumrah out I'd say. No need to go adventurous here.,14

"There was a game at the wankhede early last season or in 2018 when pant blasted 80 odd runs off like 5 overs. Kept flicking bumrah behind square for six. Not saying he's back in that form, but would be fun to watch even half of that",3
Come on DC 180 üî•,2
Prospects back to 60:40 for MI,3
It's gonna be a super difficult chase now.,4
Mumbai's fielders are getting heat,3
"Updated Pant's list: Krunal, NCN, Boult, Jayant, Boom, r/cricket",2

Big ups pant. Running good.,10
Ngl I don't expect any team from this season to recover from 22/3 vs MI. This is very impressive!,18
Give Pollard an over and hope his dibbly dobblies get a lucky wicket?,6
Pant has only 12 runs from boundaries/Sixes but he still has a strike rate of above 150,6
damn pant's made mi fans reverse jinx now,7
PANT SURVIVES BUMRAH. Ok feeling confident now,10

I hate when mi bowlers bluff. Like just fucking bowl,5
Pant is so loud on the field üòÇ,10
Pant is like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt leave my crease‚Äù,7
Pollard's bowling and wides. The perfect couple.,5
Pollard is a bait for Pant but Iyer should spank him all over the ground so he can leave Panty boy alone.,5
"Regardless of which team you support ,good to see two Indian youngsters  batting well after 3 early wickets  in pressure game.",3
"Anyone heard
Mai nahi aara crease ke bahar- pant",5
Guys anyone else who has watched cricket fever noticed that they HAD to have pandya as a bowling option. Whenever he was injured they brought in another all rounder. Why is it that they trust polly all of a sudden?,1
Pant said I didn't come out of crease,5
Who is Pant saying hello to lmao üòÇ,2
Don't know how MI is at top of fair play table when Pollard does this shit every match,6
"""Cricket has gained more respect because of IPL"" lol",6
Pollard is the opposite of what a heavy ball is,8
"Pant:""Mein nahi ata cress ke bahar"" lol",4
Oh Pollard!,1
Pant chats shit even when he is batting.,6
Pant should try not to give Pollard his wicket,5
"Ashwin is going to the whole tournament without a mankad

So Ponting really won the argument",4
"Lmao the announcer just said 'so jaa bacche nahi toh Pollard aa jayega'

T: go to sleep child, or Pollard will come for you",3
Pollard‚Äôs physique is a strange combination of being muscular and fat.,2
"Even for an MI fan, Pollard bowling is just... Irritating",6
I want to see Ashwin mankading Pollard once.,5
Pant about to Cross 35 runs,2
Ncn and pandya have atleast 4 overs left üòã,3
Anyone reading the comments?,1
Hope pant smashes pollard,1
Pollard is kinda thicc too,3
This fucking liability gently pushed a 110 kmh ball to mid on (?) lmao remove him from the team.,2
They better not attack against their strike bowler pollard,5
This thread has more RCB fans than DC ones,10
Appreciate Delhi for keeping their calm after losing 3 early wickets.,7
Imagine the scenes if Ashwin mankads Pollard.,9
Me for Rishabh Pant: Dekho Yeah Zinda Hai!,4
Guys can we save the praises for after the innings?,6
"Is it just me, or does Rohit looks fitter than the first match of IPL?",7
"What was the most forgotten about team this year? Probably KKR, were never really in the Radar.",8
Does Krunal the spinner bowl faster than Pollard the pacer?,3
He's bowling at 107ks there.,2
This is the Rishab Pant I love watching.,4
Pant with his 2018 Intent‚Ñ¢,7
They HAVE to target Pollard and Krunal,6
"""Pant peet rha hai'",4
Pant is too good today,4
"*Inhale Exhale* Keep this going, just be little cautious",15
"Keep attacking, thats the only way",12
Come on pant you beauty,9
"Cmon DC, beat the perfect bastards",9
Don't jinx my boi Pant Harsha B,18
Pies getting wickets nearly worked for Pollard,7
Pant and shreyas coming back to form in the ipl final will compensate for their inconsistency in the previous matches,8
Usual shithousery from Pollard,8
Pant waited for the entire Ipl to play this innings,6
"Big fan of Bumrah. But few days ago I stated the fact Bumrah has Bowled only 9 Yorkers in 14 matches this IPL where Natarajan has bowled 60+, From NZ tour his attempted Yorkers has been mostly low full tosses. People downvoted me and said "" Bumrah doesn't need to bowl Yorkers"" will be interesting how it goes for him today.",11
I don't feel so good. 150-160 is a winning total for finals.,4
People saying these two have Nothin to lose and should slog. You guys have any idea the abuse they'd cope if they got out even after scoring 60(30) and causing a mini-collapse.,6
"I don't mind this, Iyer playing anchor and Pant taking the risks",5
Did Hardik bowl in the 2nd half of this season??,3
Lol shitty DJ,4
If they hit pollard out of the park I shit my pants.,4
Pollard bowling is so depressing to watch,7
Dw DC bros Rohit will pay his condolences to your top order by going out early too,2
Harsha pls.no jinx,7
Pollard has only bowled 3 balls actually in his over,1
It was Trousers all season but Pant in the final,4
"God damn what a fightback, DC being a Bowling-heavy team, have a great set up now",3
How slow can you bowl like wtf why even run,3
Nobody. DJ : Ooooooooooo !!,5
gooooold,1
Bangar is an absolute boomer,3
Bring Bumrah back for one over.,1
Don't fall for the trap Pant please. He will only bowl slower deliveries in hopes of a boundary catch.,7
With that beard Pollard looks like he's missing a chin,3
Stay a couple more overs guys.,1
Krunal always looks like he's drunk,6
"Pies at military medium pace.

Pollard bowling the Stoinis special.",6
It was so good to see Krunal getting smashed. Please give him more overs Vada Pav.,9
"Pollard bowls the slower one

Speed goes down from 110 to 105kph",13
"DC got lucky to reach the finals, now they're blowing it.",-1
Cometh the hour cometh the man,6
Hetmyer is still to come 180+ is possible,7
"No one:

BangarI like the colour Gooooold",7
As a India fan it's so satisfying to see pant coming at 22-3 and playing a responsible innings,10
Can you get drunk and play in IPL match? If not why Krunal Pandya is on the ground?,8
PANT YOURE PLAYING AGINST BCCI... GIVE THEM THE BIGGEST FUCK YOU THAT YOU CAN MY BOY,10
I really hope Kishan is okay,6
Pant is standing on half pitch.,5
"OOTL, why does r/cricket have a boner for Pant ?",2
"Remember kids 

never perform in the first few matches like Samson, always perform in the finals like Pant",9
"Pant bro, you had to wait till this game to find your form? 

Lag raha hai aaj 100 maarega.",4
Lol Pant's Outta the crease.,5
"Every time they praise the Altroz, another car enthusiast dies.",11
Polly is perfect shithouse,6
haha I love the altroz comments,1
Go back into the crease pant,3
Calm down pant don't fall for the trap,3
Don‚Äôt gift your wicket to Pollard,2
Classic Pollard beat the bat gimme the ball real quick brah,2
"Pant, pls no. That looks too far ahead",2
Imagine striking at 190 over 16 games only to get that shit car as a reward.,5
"Swann to Bangar- *""tumse na ho payega beta""*",4
"Pls don't do anything stupid Pant, u deserve 70+ today",9
Yo pant what the fuck are with the swing and misses,6
Gunning DC down long enough for them to show some backbone. I will take credit for the apparent resurgence.,2
"Polly's ball goes to Keeper.

Polly: Gimme back my property",6
I feel like Ashwin is gonna be key today,1
Pant wants to stand as close as possible to dug out,1
Polly comes so does spice in the game,6
Lmao de cock,4
Pant standing kilometers away from the crease lmao,4
"the way these people describe Altroz, I might fap to it someday",7
Quinton Tierney Decock,2
Is there a limit to how far ahead of the crease can a batsman take his stance?,1
I recon RCB have most fan most out of ipl teams.(according to these these thread) May be becuase koach or ad/gayle?,1
Quinton de cock crash landed,1
"This is the best of both worlds Pant, Responsibly Explosive",5
Why isnt QDK standing up yo polly,1
De Kock slipping over bananas,1
QDK lol,1
"If pant stays till the end, DC are looking at a big score. He seems to be in the mood today.",5
"Neck beard exists

Pollard and Natarajan : you son of a bitch I'm in",9
Horror power-play is almost forgotten now,5
"Individually there are quite a few players to like in MI

Yet I can't help it but cheer any team that plays against them.",4
Except Pandya and Rohit I hate every MI player,-2
Throw so strong its field lines knocked out deKock,6
Anukul Roy will injure someone with his throws.,4
Pollard the Altroz annihilator,5
Pant needs to relax he is doing well,3
Take that,3
Sachin: Wear helmet as a keeper also,10
De cock wtf lol,5
Let's go Iyer!!!!,6
Yeahhhhh boiiiuui,3
I don't understand how Pollard doesn't get whacked for more than 10 every over.,4
Nicely cunted,6
Finally Pollard gets hit,4
Pollard gonna get 0(50) just so he doesn't get the altroz,11
Anukul Roy again as a substitute ‚ù§Ô∏è,8
Damn he can hit sixes? Where did he learn that?,3
Pant might as well come down a little further and try and trip Pollard while he completes his run-up.,9
Pollard and Krunal getting hit >>>>,10
"Pant inching a yard forward from the crease with every ball.

He's going to be level with Iyer if he carries on.",6
Oh the sweet lord of Timing!!!!!,12
"That's ease the pressure of Pant, kudos to Iyer",4
Fuck the military nothing shit.,2
DC fucking MI now.,6
If there is any chance of Mankand Ashwin should do it without any hesitation.Krunal and Pollard should be main target.,7
Motabhai. Transfer the money quick!,7
This is the Iyer that made him India's #4,9
Pollard asks for the ball from the WK as if he is a spinner and will bowl the next one right after.,5
QDK practicing football dive.,5
Thats a big blow,5
Iyer and Pant 100s pls.,7
"Cant QDK try a sneaky run out since Pant is taking guard outside crease?

I remember Pant getting out in a similar way in  U19 WC final.",3
Yes Iyer fuck him back to his land,3
GET THE FUCK IN! IYER PLAYED HIS TRADEMARK SHOT!!! üî•,5
"Too much respect for Polly, that's how you play iyer",7
Indian Test lineup go brrrr,4
LETS FUVKING GOOOOO BOYS I BELIVE AGAINNNNN,3
Even if they get out they've  already done an incredible job at recovering,4
Faaack pollard,1
Mutual funds ad was foreshadowing this final all along,4
De kock fell downüòèüòèüòè,4
Enjoyed Pant giving it all the tonks in Cook's final game. Hope to see something similar,7
Iyer into the act now... DC looking good after that initial stutter.,5
Hardik and Jadeja are #2 and #3 of death overs strike rate. Good signs for India,4
So happy both Pant and Iyer are going well today,6
I told you MI got drunk in the timeout.,3
Atleast Pollard won't bowl anymore.,3
Why does Anukul Roy come out to field every freaking match?  LOL,13
Shreyas did well to stay with that shot,6
Is this INTENT‚Ñ¢??,7
These batsmen never learn don't they. stay in the damn crease,1
Boys trust me I drank coffee (live in aus) at 1 am and fuck I am pumped due to pant and Iyer,10
The twats in Krunal and Pollard smashed. You love to see it,9
I WILL SAY NOTHING,9
"As long as you can hit 6, it's amazing how fast your strike rate can increase",11
Pant batting far out of the crease like me controlling batsmen in Cricket '97,9
"Lee,Bangar and Swann should host Top gear.",4
If MI doesnt get a wicket in the next 2 overs they will be in a mess.,4
Even contest again,6
Simping to the Altroz again,5
Ultimate redemption arc for pant and shreyas if they pull this off,11
"313.5 on fantasy so far, pls dont get out guys. Rank 1 as for now",8
I mean whats the difference between a dc and rcb fan anyways ;),6
RCB should watch this match. DC doing what RCB failed to do,13
Bas bhai reverse sweep mat mario abhi..,8
Pollard is a wannabe Rajat Bhatia,15
Yes. We're shit at times. But this team knows how to fight back. That's all I wanted them to do tbh. Not fold like earlier matches,14
We are in the match against Mumbai for once!,5
"Getting 8 overs out of NCN, Krunal and Pollard is going to be difficult",3
"This is how a captain should play in a big game

Kohli take notes",15
Watte shot my captain,5
170-180 might not be enough to stop MI.,7
I hope Iyer does a Dyer and destroys the Indians,9
"This is depressing to watch

Get a wicket",6
Should target 170 atleast. With dew coming it could become an easy chase for MI,10
"As an Indian cricket fan, watching these two bat well is a great feeling!!!",9
Is Pant standing that far to nullify the slow balls somehow?,5
Am i the only one who hate Pollard the bowler...  annoyingly slow deliveries.,9
MI need luck going their way with one shot. Otherwise DC are cruising to 180.,3
Mi's bowlers other than Bumrah & Boult have been pretty average. Pant & Iyer taking advantage of it.,7
So Pant chose NOW to come back???? I mean I‚Äôm happy for him but... why now??,6
"Lol imagine the embarrassment from just tripping over in the ipl final, he's gonna remember that when he can't sleep for years",2
All I am gonna say it‚Äôs an even year 2020. MI only wins in odd years.,8
"180+ is totally reachable now. As a MI fan, this scares me.",5
I like how the 2 batsman of Delhi that have played every match (excluding injuries) and didn't made much impact are making in impact together. *Sheds a tear*,10
2020 Mumbai Indians = 2016 golden state warriors. So would make sense if they choke in the finals.,8
Man that was a clean hit by iyer,10
"Too early to say, but this partnership is bringing back memories of that legendary Dhoni-Yuvi partnership.",11
How many MI fans in the house ?,7
Iyer is probably going to feast on that Yadav over,6
Why do sky sports ads have a guy speaking English with an Indian accent?,5
So two Bumrah overs in the end. Have to continue with this onslaught,8
Is pant the new Shane Watson? Do shit all in groups and go ballistic in finals,9
I'm scared of the fact that MI got 200 here in Q1,6
Get a wicket god dammit,-3
Is there anyone else other than Iyer who plays that shot over long on but head is not looking up but sideways,6
NCN looks like a Greek god.,5
More than 160 pressure will be on MI,7
Pant and Iyer Batting like we wanted them to Bat. Fuckin good time to produce that.,6
Pollard bowls from a run-up like SHoaib Aklhtar,12
Iyer and pant apology thread incoming,8
"Shreyas Iyer, coached by Ricky Ponting, is going well in a final. The same Ricky Ponting who used a spring bat in 2003. Open your eyes, sheeple",13
Ok bois the final is not as shit as we thought,4
"Don't mind me, just getting my flair ready for the real big series.",7
"Damn DC back in the game. Similar to how MI came back in qualifier 1. Come on MI, get a breakthrough.",3
Iyer is 9 runs away from 500 runs this season!? Really!?,4
Good to see young players taking responsibility and playing like this.,9
"Lol Sunny G saying ""at the right time"" with accent is hilarious",3
~~39*~~ 40* is highest score for Pant in IPL2020.,9
"We ban any user that is gonna end up saying ""but it's not an odd year"" OK?",12
"NCN has been medicore all season...
Today's his day to shine...",3
"I really believe that Iyer and Pant are going to close the matches for India. Please God, you've already taken away Yuvraj and Dhoni about 4 years ago. It is about time.",9
[removed],0
Pollard must be the most annoying bowler to face. He jobs in 15 m to bowl at 105 kph and add to that all his gamesmanship,6
Rabada and Nortje fishing.,3
Don't want to Jinx it but I haven't seen Iyer or pant bat with this maturity ever before.,5
"Lmao Iyers ""worst season"" is actually his best season",23
Pant üòªüòªüòªüòª,4
[deleted],2
"Mumbai fans please stop trying to jinx your way to breaking this partnership, calm the fuck down",9
"I'm just happy this is going to be a good chase (regardless of whoever wins).. when DC lost early wickets I was like ""here we go.. another boring match""",7
[deleted],3
I heard Mitch Mclenaghan just sits in the hotel,8
"Motabhai ready to open suitcase,nervously points at Ponting ,secretly delivers the suitcase to Ponting,Ponting hurries inside waiting for the CEAT strategic timeout,Motabhai calls Sheikh ready to create distraction among the DC players.Ponting gestures and calls out Pant and Shreyas,Pant glares at the suitcase full of cash wanting to eat the tasty food whereas Shreyas is given chance for the National Team if they both get out.Ponting tells Shreyas to take half of the cash and tells him to distribute it in the DC team.Motabhai amd Rohit both grin at each other.Polly Kaka and Fuccboi come in full form.El Boulto and De Cock already decide to make plans for the night.Sky is guaranteed a selection on the National team.Everyone is happy here except the DC fans.The betting and fixing  happens again and the betters earn huge money while the ones who lost betts are DC fans.There is a huge amount of happiness behind the fake victories and MI fans unknowingly boo the DC fans of 5th victory.There are huge bets made without anyone's notice.

By DevilKillerX,
A MI Fan.

(No offense to MI and DC fans,this is just a joke)",9
"3 of the last 8 are coming from Boulto and Bumrah.

They cannot afford to relax against the rest.",3
"Both of the guys took their own sweet time to come into groove, came at just the perfect time",10
how is Mumbai at the top of Fairplay with constant Pollard stops,10
Wicket this over?,0
MI's Weak link is the 3rd pacer...,4
"DC fans: Mere ~~Karan-Arjun~~  Iyer-Pant aagaye.

Also DC fans: Fuck AC & Fuck Tesla too.",5
Consider 18 over innings and add 10-12 runs for Bumrahs's 2 overs.,4
If we don't break this partnership within 2 overs we'll be chasing 165+,5
5 of 8 Boult & Bumrah overs done. DC's score looking decent now.,3
Iyer looks abit like badrinath,7
Game is slipping away,6
Who tf is the DJ talking to?,8
Gotta hold DC under 150 here. Bumrah has been uncharacteristically quiet tonight.,7
Ah India's future is in safe hands!,9
Imagine these two in the WC  semi-final (I know Pant was there) instead of Dhenier and DK,9
Man I spent 30 mins defending pant when my friend was calling him trash. Hope he gets a 70 odd score,11
They are wasting too much time before balls now just to break their rhythm.,8
Pant needs a timeout badly,7
Coulter Nile has been useless for MI,3
Pant saved all his energy for the Finals,11
Hope they brought my boi Mishy back from India to lift the title if they go on to win today. The original Daredevil deserves it.,8
Wicket in next 2 overs come on,2
"Everyone before this Match : DC giving a free ride to Iyer and Pant to the final. 

Well I guess these two are paying their dues rather well tonight.",9
Rabada and Nokia discussing how Ambani hooked them in like a fisherman,10
Is Rahul Chahar injured?,5
150 pls. At least we will have something,4
Would be quite the comeback if they score 180 now,6
"*Iyer-Pant partnership exists*

Sad MI fan noises, happy India fan noises",19
The jinxing is high tier rn,7
"This Iyer-Pant partnership has got shades of that 2017 Pant-Samson partnership, altho that one was an absolute demolition job by both against GL(?)",4
[removed],7
"I'll be honest, don't have any hopes that DC will win today, but atleast they're giving a good fight.",7
Finally. Good to see Pant play his game. Almost everytime he has come out to bat during a DC top order collapse this season.,5
Iyer playing captain‚Äôs knock.,6
One over of either off spin or Pollard is left. Must go for 18 or more.,7
BRING KRUNAL BACK AGAIN,5
Why tf are people celebrating like prime Yuvi and Dhoni are back from this one knock?,4
Mini indian batting line up DC,9
Pinch Hitter of the 90s Jay Shah impressed with the youngsters mature partnership,7
Anukul Roy is so good in the field!,6
"For whom this announcer is shouting on the ground? who will cheer, jeetega bhi jeetega? there are only handful of supporters mostly officials",5
Missing toxic CSK fans in the final....,2
Geez specialist fielder Anukul Roy is good!,3
"I'm convinced Shaw-Pant-Iyer form is linked. If Shaw was batting this game, he'd do good",17
If only i had a rupee everytime anyone has wished for MI loss this final.,16
Lol there's still 4 overs of boult and bumrah to come.,4
Yar anukul yar kya he bhai. Calm down yar.,5
What‚Äôs the update on Kishan?,4
"5 balls in an over from NCN are slow balls.

Waiting for him to remove his mask and reveal Venkatesh Prasad.",12
Anukul roy : They call me the fastest man alive,9
MI did good on having a deep batting order in case a collapse happens,9
Could this be a career-defining innings for Pant? This innings could demonstrate to the selectors that if given proper guidance he can become a better batsman,5
I am guessing ishan Kishan won‚Äôt bat so mumbai are already down to 10 men,9
Glad the boys are rotating strike.,5
I just want to see Mumbai fans cry. Is that too much to ask???,3
Anukul should be retained just for his fielding lmao,18
Simran Hetmyer watching Bihar election results,16
Holy shit I feel patriotic AF watching Delhi play well way more than our national team.,2
Today punter told pant go and demolish them. Play your natural game.,11
This ankul guy looks like some fielder. He is everywhere,17
These sub fielders must be given appreciation awards,20
Thank you Iyer and Pant for this partnership or I will be just in deep down misery.,15
Why do I see only Anukul Roy in the field? I know he is a Sub but he is over utilized by MI :),7
This gonna be a good chase so a good final,10
Pant found the perfect game to cross 40 for the 1st time in the season.,9
Hope pant can runs 2s.,6
This MI team has pampered their fans so much with their dominance that one small partnership from DC is sending jitters through them.,11
MI always make sure that substitute fielder is in the ground and make some batsman rest.,12
*Un*cool Roy is pretty cool if you ask me.,10
"DC would be happy with 12/0 off the remaining bumrah overs. They can go really hard on boult's last over. 160 min from here and if they do really well, they can get to 175",7
Ambani's sitting there pretending they don't know the script,44
[deleted],-11
Dam someone tell Pant to put his folds back into the oven,7
[removed],16
I smell a big over coming,7
"DC have made a great comeback, 170-180 is back on the cards",14
Pant in good form >>> Kishan in good form,17
Thanks NCN for that 5 run over.,12
Nita Ambani prayer incoming bois,32
NCN redemption arc?,5
"Very happy with this fightback, gotta finish at 170 to have a fighting chance",8
Good over Coulter nile,9
Why the fuck would you call the time-out when your batters are set,10
"Given how the match is going,I totally expect Rohit to get out first ball like Stoinis.",8
They're playing NCN like he's bumrah. Smash him please.,11
Anukul roy doesn't get chance to play in the 11 and is also probably underpaid for his fielding.,6
"Is this real , pant didnt get out in his 30's ?",21
7 overs 70?,3
"Yep boys.. I know it's a bit clich√© to say, but we have memed pant to form",10
"The strategic timeout punter smile is the reason for this fear. Its do or die for Pant and Iyer. 

Literal death.",7
If they get de kock out early pressure will be on MI. Yeah their side is strong but he's been really clutch in those opening overs,2
Why does Krunal look fit for Vimal pan masala ad,9
Pollard and pandya should open.,-5
I would absolutely bust a nut to see Pant have a Tewatia like over and smash 4-5 sixes,8
Out of these last 7 overs how many overs of Boult n Bumrah?,5
"The issue for MI though is that Bumrah isn't looking as threatening today. Boult only has one. And Krunal is not bowling well. So, NCN needs to bowl really well.",6
"Need to get to 170 for here.

There is good bounce. Rabada and Nortje are totally in play.",6
[deleted],8
"Opens the thread.
Sees Ankul Roy everywhere.",9
Mumbai mavericks Vs Haryana hurricanes,14
Iyer and Pant have turned into Ponting and Gilchrist today,9
Anukul Roy looks like Mithali Raj bruh,12
A fightback ... that's all I wanted and happy to see them doing exactly that.,5
Punter has lost his maniacal grin.,1
"DC please score 180+ 

Only way to make a match out of the final.",6
Score 200 or MI will take this game,6
"DC has 5 overs to go bang-bang even if we count Boomrah out, possible 170+",3
First time I'm happy there's a time out. My heart needs rest,10
Should have hit NCN,3
"New timeout, MI drink coffee, sober up. Four wickets coming up.",6
Ponting singing the DC fight song in Iyer's ears. Intense background music ....,7
"What a time to comeback to form!!!

 Pant will fuck Mumbai up if he's there past 16th over!!! 

My chubby monster!",14
Ankhul is a god. He's everywhere. /s,10
Was pant out of form in the second half of the season or was he just playing(miserably) the way koach drilled into his head he should(also injury effects) ?,6
"Still think If Pant was not being Fat-shamed by fans on social media he would have been more consistent. We all know what happened after Inzimam-Ul-haq was called "" Fat Potato"" in Ind vs Pak match in Canada. He couldn't score another 100 for next 16 months. üòû",6
Look at how much better Pant looks when he plays his natural game.,8
"Jokes Aside,NCN bowled a good over.",9
"So far so good DC, don't fuck this up please",7
I se Nita but where's Fatfuck Douchecunt Ambani Jr?,5
One more pollard over pls,6
Rohit gonna show his form like pant and make this contest a thiccfest,13
"Still pretty confident with our bowling to close games, we don't typically let teams smash too hard at the end of matches. But oof, the middle spell has not been good for us. Iyer and Pant have been tremendous.",8
"Iyer has played really well but has to go bonkers now, Hetmyer is remaining so should not worry",6
This slow ball trap by MI can backfire if they don't mix it up.,3
Is Kishan fit enough to bat? He still hasn't come out to field yet.,4
Should still target Boult. Boult in death overs <<< Boult in powerplay.,7
[deleted],10
Will bumrah bowl next over?,3
"Need to score at 76 from here to get to 175, which would be Par score here imo.",5
Dugout sometimes feels like a group of boomers judging the young generation.,8
Kaise ho dilli walo,5
That girl in the forevermark ad is holy shit levels of pretty.,4
Anukul Roy specialist sub fielder,2
"Man fuck timeouts, they better not get out",2
"Ponting during strategic break, to Iyer: they have couple of overs from spin left- play along the ground, hit the bad balls, rotate strike. Turns to Pant- SMASH",9
[deleted],3
OH shit. Krunal again?????,4
3 wickets after 13 overs in not that bad.  RR of 7.6 is also good.,2
"Rishabh plays with ""aggression""

**People:** rap on the knuckles go brrrrr

Rishabh plays ""sensibly"" 

**People:** fuck go back go back",5
What a partnership though,6
"The oddest thing was Nasser Hussain‚Äôs monologue today. Like, hello Nass, where have you been lad?",2
This is the over to exploit,4
This over might be the difference between 175 odd and 160 odd,8
make or break over for MI,3
Krunal always convinces Rohit in the timeout to give him the over,8
2 overs of krunal/Pollard/yadav left. 30 runs minimum from them for DC to go into the death on a high,1
"Happy to see pant and iyer firing under pressure, wt20 hopes even wo kohli getting higher",3
"If DC win today, and I know there's a long way to go, RCB and KXIP will remain members of the unwanted club of franchises to not have won the IPL.",4
"Krunal against Pant, rip. 20 run over incoming",4
"Pant plays 1 good match. 

Lara- pant is better than samson, raoool.",3
koi pant ko har over ke baad ek red bull pilao.,2
Someone pls cast Jacqueline for a film. Can't bear the Josh ads,5
There you go,2
Pant will be back to India team.,3
Wicket Alert.,2
Ok krunal gonna bowl fast yorkers,4
Krunal‚Ñ¢ back at it,3
Krunal bouta get pumped,5
They need to smash Krunal here,5
Wtf is this Krunal even bowling.,3
Expecting wide Yorkers and a bouncer from krunal this over,6
Krunal the wide yorker specialist,6
Solid comeback this from DC,6
I would love if they both hit the 50. Loved their partnership,5
Krunal looks wasted.,3
why tf has krunal pandya got so much attitude!!,5
"Indian middle order batsman plays one good innings:


Indians on r/cricket: oUr miDdlE oRdEr iS In gOod hAndS",14
Bumrah song needs to be xmas number 1,2
why the fuck is this guy bowling again,4
Krunal has a real punchable face,9
2 from 1 bowl. Please Krunal don't give 15.,3
Lara saying India need Pant because he is a stabiliser after aggressors like Rahul and Kohli.,11
Krunal Wideya at it again,13
Krunal looks like a frustrated Ajay Devgan,9
Financial Capital of India Vs Capital of India.,9
In before Krunal bowls a bouncer,6
Why is Pandya making all these faces and trying to look wayy cooler than he actually is,2
Sensing Shreyas wicket here. Hope I am wrong,2
Predictions? I think MI will chase whatever DC post in 16 overs.,5
Brave of rohit to still bowl krunal against pant,2
"I'm so happy they've finally managed to fight back. 

Still doesn't feel like enough runs yet, and there's still 2 Bumrah overs and 1 Boult remaining, but this is a definite improvement from previous games against MI.",3
I kinda miss the older players. Would like to see Mahela bat again.,3
Krunal is bowling pies! Why aren't they taking him to the stands?,5
Using stoinis ahead was not a great decision imo,5
Momos vs Vada Pav,3
"I am big fan Bumrah.

Wait this isn't Hotstar chat",9
Delhi did exceptionally well to recover from that ugly mess. Well done Pant & Iyer.,8
"
Mahela is nervous",4
Smash pant smash!!!,5
[deleted],3
3 from 2. Please bowl well.,1
"If they do 180 and get de kock out, DC should have this",4
[Nita Ambani ready to pray today be like](https://imgur.com/gallery/QvpSBhd),4
Always love to see a female coaching such a big IPL side!,18
Jayawardene saying they could have been more attacking against Iyer and Pant in the Powerplay,6
Mahela just said ‚Äúleadership group‚Äù lmao.,7
"Punter clapping and walking onto the field.

Pointing: Ok, camera's gone. Pant, stop with the Thala 2.0 and start hitting it",9
Iyer has to stay till the end imo. Have to ensure we don't lose 3 for 20 runs now,3
lEaDeRsHiP gRoUp,7
Fuck he's learning from Pollard,2
Mahela looking around to see if Ashwin is hanging around!!!,9
MI somehow seems to have assembled a team of punchable faces.,8
Iyer needs to go bonkers now. We know he‚Äôs capable of it. We have hetmyer and axar still to come.,7
"Everytime Krunal and Pollard bowl, I die a little inside",9
Someone explain me what Jacqueline says in the ad!,3
Fuck this is IPL not galli cricket Krunal ffs,4
"A concussion (vs Australia Jan, 2020) actually was the reason why Pant lost his place in the national side and he looked completely out of touch since then.. Big night tonight for him!",6
"Had been rcb in that position, they would have choked rock hard.",4
Attack Krunal ffs,3
kurnal doesn't even want to bowl to pant,6
Good over from KP so far,2
Agree with Mahela,2
I wish more people had burmahs humility.,3
come on Pant!!! make em pee their pants.,4
DC has become sloww,2
[deleted],8
Even Krunal doesn't know what he is going to bowl next,4
Did Ponting say he'd order chole bhature and butter chicken if Pant performs or something.,2
How are MI at the top of fairplay charts. They have Krunal and Pollard with their perpetual stop-starts gamesmanship,7
"Idc if you get out , hit pandya every goddamn ball",4
Even Krunal got surprised by that ball,1
"The two guys who began this DC transformation story by forming a strong young Indian core 3-4 years ago

It's just poetic that they build a partnership today and take their team out of a tough position",3
"Does anyone actually like these pitch-side interviews with the coaching staff? Most of the time, it's just generic question and answers",3
"Krunal and Pollard, both have attitude like they invented penicillin.",3
[removed],-8
Game back on. Fantastic effort.,2
"With 2175 IPL runs, **Shreyas Iyer** is now highest runscorer for Delhi team. He surpasses Sehwag tally of 2174 runs (For Delhi)",11
"Man, Krunal has not been good today .....",1
"Now imagine a dreamy start in PP courtesy Stoin Dhawan, Good 8 runs an over in the middle courtesy Iyer Pant, finishing explosively by Hetmyer. And bowling with that team. Yea that has been MI this whole season. We have had that in patches",5
Mahela more unbiased than some commentators,16
Krinal pandya's bowling would have been eaten alive by prime yuvraj,7
Man i just wish stoinis had played well. Could have had 130-140 by now.,7
What the fuck . This guy doesn't deserve dots and singles,8
"OMG. SMASH HIM! what are you two waiting for, bumrah?",14
"MI's plans against Pant are so predictable.

Spin - deliveries outside off

Pace - slow deliveries",3
was that a drop?,1
Krunal matching the speeds of polly,5
Holy shit mahela flaming rohit,2
LETZOOO,4
Krunal is bowling at Rajat Bhatia speeds now,10
Good last ball. Come on.,3
"Too much hate for Krunal on this Sub, he is decent guys. Bowls quick, lots of variations. Bats well once in a while.",16
V imp ball this,2
I've lost the count of no of 2s Pant has refused to run.,4
When these two started batting together I was hoping for a Shreyas 60 and Pant 40 to get them to 180. Other way round but even better I think,1
So it's gonna be close to 150-160 target.,2
"English - 'I am jerking off'

Hindi - 'Mahela raha hu'",18
Nice shottt,2
Krunal will be jealous of Hardick,4
Shut up and let me watch the game ffs,4
This is one of those situations now where it's best to 'hit from one end' - Shreyas should be looking to bat out the next 5 overs at a run a ball while the other end can go nuts.,2
"What a shot pant, shades of dilli gali cricket in it",1
Anyone else getting an echo???,3
These 2 have found form at the perfect time,11
"I have heard Rohit and Hardik talk about how Ponting mentored them during the MI days and he‚Äôs clearly influential in the DC dressing room as well. 

If you‚Äôd said, in that acrimonious season of 2007-08 that he‚Äôd have that kind of influence one day on a few Indian players, you‚Äôd have got laughed out of town.",17
Good shot Pant. Fuck you Krunal,13
"I miss the days of Bhajji slapping Sreesanth and hugging Nita Ambani.


One of those caused him to be banished from Indian cricket.",15
What a sweet shot,3
[deleted],5
Lovely,2
BroomSweep‚Ñ¢ by Pant,7
9 runs off pandya. DC you are a joke and I hate myself for backing you.,5
Goddammit! Need prayer aunty asap.,3
Cute shot.,4
Noice shot,2
Ffs terrible last ball,2
Yo dawg what the fuck. Why aren't we smashing against NCN and Krunal? Do we actually think we can target Boult and Bumrah? No chance,7
Get fucked Krunal,1
Good over ruined by stupid Last ball,1
"Remember the name

RISHABH PANT",2
All these shaiks sitting and pretending they don't know shit,2
A much needed boundary and a very good shot.,1
Hotstar shitting the bed rt? I don't think it's my connection.,4
Man Krunal. You've just murdered any momentum NCN brought from that over. Really should have just tried to bowl the wide Yorker.,3
Such a clever shot,1
Cheeky sweep!!,3
Get fucked Krunal. Nice shot Pant!,2
Last ball ruined a great 14th over for MI,6
"Holy shit I love this shot by Pant.

He played the same against Starc (at 145 kmph) in Australia!",12
Time to explode iyer,2
This is what Mumbai had in Qualifiers after 14 overs. They got 200. Let‚Äôs see what we get lol.,8
"**rishabh pant exists**

r/Cricket : perform, you fat fuck!!

y'all really rude to him fr",22
Pant 50 please...,2
But why is Krunal not in the Indian team? /s,4
Pant makes a 100 & I'll post my naked tummy for haters. #FightFatShamers,12
Stfu bangar,3
At last we are seeing the real PANT. Please do play on till the end.,3
60 off final 6 is more than possible; we have a game on folks,3
Who's going to bowl that 1 over???,2
Krunal is just a medium pacer with a short run up.,4
Delhi can get 50-60 of the remaining six,2
Really impressed by Shreyas and Pant standing up after DC were teetering initially. They are giving themselves a good chance to get to a fairly competitive total in the finals.,5
Dread it... Run from it.... Weird Place Boundary Panty still arrives.,8
Hotstar view counter is fucked thus time. Last final it was 20 million plus,8
Idea for bottom hand issue of Iyer. Velcro grips and velcro gloves.,2
Bowl Bumrah and Boult out now!!!,0
The word 'literally' should be immediately banned from the English language.,8
"That is the shot which has made Pant so hyped up, guy is so fucking unconventianlly explosive. Has to give lot of importance to fitness. Has too much of potential which would be disastrous if not given importance by him",4
They should target the next 3 overs as final 3 will be between Boult and Bumrah,2
"Bruh this bottom hand coming off disease is bloody contagious, wtf

First, Pant last year discovered it and now Iyer has caught it",2
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jrjwwl/match_thread_final_delhi_capitals_v_mumbai_indians/gbtx2hw/

Pretty close, better even",1
"Do something guys, anything but do something! Only 6 overs left...",1
"Anything below 180 for MI, will be cake walk for them. Everyone is in top form for them right now.",6
Wicket big over and everything alert,2
"I actually feel Sanjay Bangar was a good batting coach for team India, not sure why he couldn't keep the job",9
Take NCN to the cleaners now ffs,6
Bangar u sexy thic beast,5
You have to attack NCN. Can't afford to respect both him and Bumrah.,6
"Damn, how good is Bangar's analysis on batsmen.",13
"Iyer should start attacking too, otherwise it will make too much pressure on Pant",2
NCN bowling a tight line and length! Damn,1
Hetmeyer and axar to follow,3
"I hate how there are so many education ads nowadays , it kinda stresses me out lol",5
What's the highest number of comments a cricket match thread ever had ? iirc 25k ?,3
"What was that idiot Shastri thinking when he said that ""rap on the knuckles"" thing about Pant?",3
[deleted],2
With Bumrah coming soon...DC should look to attack here,4
Chal pant chalu hoja,1
"Why aint any one talking abt Rohit being defensive 

U got an opponent 3 down with 3 overs left from Bumrah n u still allow them to escape",3
Cant believe Sanjay was sacked. He has great knowledge,5
Can't even hit ncn. Smh,-1
Does NCN bowl faster or KP? Difference won't be much right,2
Need 12 from this one,3
Has rahane played well in a single match this season lol,6
Come on DC time to switch to the top gear,3
"2 Bumrah, 1 Boult, 2NCN and 1 ?",3
"Gimme 175, Delhi, that'll make it competitive.  

Can't tolerate another Mumbai win.",6
Hindsight is 6/6 Murali Karthik,6
This is the first IPL officialy without Yuvraj Singh and man I really miss my most favourite player :(,12
[removed],-21
"NCN, change your angle now.",1
DC playing so defensively. It's not a test match.,1
"Good recovery and I'm happy, but this is going to still be a below par total considering Mumbai OP batting line-up.",5
Is History gonna repeat itself? Will Pant hit Bumrah all over park tonight ?,5
They have to hit or get out now,4
"did mahela just say "" L E A D E R S H I P.  G R O U P""???",7
Mahela as a player never won a final (I think he won one in 2014). Ponting won almost all finals he was in. You know which way is it going.,5
"Ngl tho there's something about the hitting abilities of dilli bois. I've played against a team which composed majorly of commercial dhol players, I got smacked for 8 sixes in two overs and every single one went out of the ground.",1
35 ball 70 would be great from here,2
"Reminder since it didn't happen in long time, Pant's strike rate shoots up a lot after he goes past 50",4
Who are they waiting to target now? Boult N Bumrah?,3
"No boundary fielders down the ground

Go for it pant",2
Pandya at fine leg? Lol,2
"Come on guys, start attacking.",3
What's NCN trying to do with this field?,1
Can the DJ STFU pls?,2
"After Pant, it is Brohit's turn to play big innings finally. He has been the batting weak link this season so far.",2
Lol,1
"Fuckers call us Mumbai lite.

More than half their bowling line up played for us: Boult, NCN, Jayant.",7
DC still has DD(Daredevil) spirit going on. One dull sense to boost other senses.,1
Isn't this in Dubai? I think MI has lost the most of our matches here this IPL.,6
"Iyer has to start hitting, Pant and Hetmyer will finish this now",5
Pant playing when it matters.,12
Looks like Pant and Iyer haven't received their payments from Ambani today... yet.,1
Lol Cork,1
Smart shot,2
"Iyer Iyer, pants on fire",3
Respekt,2
"One guy sitting in that ""don't sit here"" seat",6
"Therapist : Responsible Pant isn't real. He can't hurt you. 


Responsible Pant :",14

Well played boy..... Good to see play better now..,4
"Just stupid field placement . With that angle, Pant will hit you to fine leg all day. Don't be so overconfident MI.",1
Well played Pant. Letszooooooooooo.,1
Any reason MI stopped playing Pattinson?,1
BIG GAME PLAYER PANT.... KOHLI AND RAVI IN SHAMBLESSS,5
Pant is that short kid who thought that the bowler can't beat me with bouncers if I stand 3 yards down the pitch,-1
Red Panty Night,2
Excellent Pant!!!,2

Hahah Dominic cork.,2
Excellent fifty.. now go smash them boys..,2
This is the luck factor you need to win big games,3
"No matter the result, I am just happy to see Pant play a good innings in a pressure game",3
One bounce both times or it was 2 sixes in row!,2
All you need when team is shitting all over is a good pair of Pants,5
Wow Pant. Super lucky. Stars are with DC today.,2
Someone told Pant he was going to be made temporary captain in Australia so he's playing his natural game to get out of it.,2
"Pant in all other matches - Patrick Star

Pant in final - Handsome Squidward",9
Great turnaround by Delhi,1
"what a comeback, respekt from pluto",5
"Tactical placement directly over the keeper

Pant can do it all",1
Imagine the feeling if a batsman comes to form against you after poor performances throughout,3
Whao dc looks good,1

Good job Pant. You did what nobody thought you could do.,5
Great. Now they have Hetmyer in to thrash us around.,7
Delhi with an incredible fight back. Mumbai are in trouble if they dont get a wicket soon considering some of their bowling options,5
I started watching and dc lost 3 wickets. I stopped watching and pant makes a 50. Dont worry guys I won't watch the match anymore. Go dc,22

"It‚Äôs over, MI has an insane batting lineup",9
That's some good field placement.,9
You can't hit every fucking shot in the same direction,8

Still a very good innings by Pant. Iyer has to become explosive if we dont reach 170 this is gonna be Mumbais game easily,7
Did his part. Stage set for Hetmyer now,9

Tf one more ad,1
Hetmyer's literally gonna decide the match.,8
Hetmyer for 50(10),7
Thiccmyer time,3
"Great inning, got us back on track, bring on fucking ~~axar~~ hetmyer and tell him to hit it, counter attack bitches",6
"Keep your head up Pant, well played",8
"Please DC try to get 190 somehow. At least make it a little competitive, even though we know MI can chase 209",4
HUGE wicket! Great field placement!,5
Bumrah now and get Hetmyer?,0
expecting some hetmyer magic,3
Well played Pant. You delivered more than expected but less than you could have.,3
Lets goooo hetmyer,2
"It's mostly on Iyer now, If he stays till the end, DC will be 170+ easy.",3
Well played Pant,4
Why didnt they choose Pattinson?,1
What a Pant moment,5
"That was clearly the plan to get him out. Great captaincy. NCN tried that previous delivery as well. Rohit also placed Hardik there, one of the best catchers.",8
Krunal or Pollard for this one?,1
"Even though Pant hit a 50, he is still completely untrustworthy. This was literally a broken clock situation. That last shot he got out? He tried to hit I there 3 times in the last over. He just doesn't learn because he's just not smart. He's got an eye but no brain.",-1
"Great innings, I just hope that regardless of end result of the game this gives Pant the confidence boost he needs.",6
"no Pant hate at all here please‚Äî he fucking stood up when it mattered, and perished after still getting runs off that NCN over. G fucken g mate",9
"2 for Bumrah, 1 for Boult, 1 for Jayant

Who gets the last over? Pollard or NCN?",5
Good inning from Pant. Will get his mindset back into place.,5
Time for a caribbean feast,3
"Very good innings, but couldn't he notice that when he's playing the same shot again and again, there will be a fielder set there?",7
Where are you lads  listening to GG? Listening to Karthik is doing my head in.,2
It's big booty time,2
Soda party yaaaay.,2
Hetmyer needs to play an absolute blinder here...,2
"Chaalo. Australia mein century maarlena. Well played, Pant!",9
Well played,3
"Pant played well, however his offside game is still weak. Great innings regardless",4
Don't worry guys another thicc boi is coming,5
I think DC lost momentum in the last few overs. They need 60+ in last 5. Bumrah will bowl 2 of them.,2
"Good wicket NCN, come on MI, keep it tight",1
Jayant against Iyer? 20 run over incoming,3
Boom Boom should be back for next over,1
Does anyone know the name of that Hindi rap song they keep playing in the background?,1
People asking for 170. Bruh did you forget 2 overs of bumrah and 1 of boult in these 5 remaining overs?,1
Remarkably the total weight of the batsmen remains constant,5
"Jayant ""Bench Warmer"" Yadav is back into the attack.",2
It's big booty time,3
"Yesss boys, one more and Mi has this in the bag! Well batted pant!",5
Idk why Pollard has something against Hetmeyer. He has a lot of strategies against him too.,5
This over will be critical with well set Shreyas facing a spinner,3
"Great knock by Pant tbh, took doubles early, targeted Krunal which was his best option.",10
Jayant Vs Hetmyer: competition.,6
This is the game right here... Can they get at least 50 in these final 5?,4
Jayant yadav now? Hmmmmm,3
Forgot about Hetmeyer...was wondering where ol' Axar is for his slogging,3
"Although Pant missed chance to smash but with 56(38), he already did required, thicc boi turn now",9
"Pant came back to form

Only fair that Rohit also hits some now üòâ",6
Keep Iyer off strike,2
Pant already had 10 off the over. Why didn't he go for a single when there are 5 overs left?,1
If you have ever called someone bhenchodh you are legally required to support Delhi today,40
"Is it just me, or is it a little stupid that they put the Final on a Tuesday? 

The hype isn't as incredible as it should've been",9
Why has Hardik not bowled even single ball this season?,10
Didn't Pant see Pandya there????,6
[deleted],2
"Pointing: Ok, now send Stoinis in

Management: Boss, he was opener. He got out

Ponting: hellodarknessmyoldfriend",80
So 3 more from Boult Boom. One from NCN ?,9
Pants are off. Its either fuck or get fucked.,6
Well played Pant,5
oof that turned,3
">  No need to play that shot

What a fucking chutiya comm straight from madan lal school of commentary",7
Iyer attack ffs,2
"Well good that Pant found some form, we need all in form players we can get for Australia test series.",8
[deleted],1
"Pant showed up in the most important match, that's all that matters now üëç",7
Any update on kishan,3
Ashwin must be licking his lips,6
One thicc replaced by another,8
"Maybe he could've tried a different shot, they laid a trap and he fell for it. Still a good innings",5
Huge turn.... get to 170 boys and game on.,2
"On current form, I would still prefer Saha over pant in tests any day but now that he is injured I hope pant makes a case for himself",1
"Swanny talking about Yadav, thought he was just on about Hetty's batty

Giant.",1
Ash would be good here too then right?,4
Single le le simran,4
encouraging signs for ash and the leggie,7
Mumbai just saved at least 20-25 runs by getting Pant wicket.,9
What is the pitch? Flat? Seeming? Turning?,2
Rising Pune SuperJayant,14
DC have 3 spinners...,9
"DC needs 170+, cmon",3
Hetmyer is T H I C C!,6
Ashwin is Going to terrorize us on this pitch,9
"With that spin, Ashwin must be jumping!",5
Some people are still blaming Pant wtf,4
Fuck that turn!!,5
Precious 2 dot balls,2
"This should be Pant's role. Come in, score 50 odd runs and get out if you want. As long he plays natural game, he contributes enough",2
Oh shit Ashwin and Axar are gonna spin it,5
pitch is only going to be bowling friendly right?,4
Forward defence smh,3
Does Hetmeyer play tests for Windies,4
Did that just square turn wtf,3
"There is this theory which decides why most rich people look good. It says over a long period of time rich people especially men, married beautiful girls.
This over a number of generations and with help of genetics, most rich people  inherited those genes and became beautiful.

But wdf happened to the DC owners.
Obesity !",8
One ethical boy licking his lips seeing this,5
Really liking whatever I am seeing of  Jayant Yadav here. Get him back into the selection radar.,6
That sounded like an edge,0
Lmao swanny read the murli comparisons here.,1
de Kock struggling to focus on the ball with booty before him.,20
Hetmyer looks like he just woke up,9
"Jayant ""Jayasuriya"" Yadav",7
[removed],-14
Giant fucking around with thiccboi,3
Approximately 50 from the last 5 is needed to give DC that runs on the board edge. Any less and you'd think MI will chase it at a canter,2
This is why you bowl off spinner to left handers and don't just assume any wrist spinner should be in the team.,9
Iyer usually loves spin.,2
Great over for MI,1
"Honestly, i think pant wanted a six and he was pretty mad probably because he didn‚Äôt time it well.",6
Jayant swings so damn good! Almost scared the shit outta Hetmeyer.,6
looks like maggi is being cooked on hetnyers head,7
Does jayant look like cheap Imran Tahir,9
Jayant bumrah.,10
No Holder to tie Hetmyer laces today,6
Iyer ideally needs to take charge now.,6
"Jayant Yadav is that guy who scored a test century against England in the Karun Nair 300 series, right?",16
I need the dancing Iyer back now that Pant is out.,3
Ashwin and Axar licking their fingers.,3
170 with 2 overs from Bumrah. Looks tough,3
Good shot,2
Nice,2
DC were 96 at 12.2 overs..,3
Rishabh pant only knows how to play one way. Hit sixes with risky shots and then get out playing those same risky shots.,1
"Unpopular opinion : But Axar should have been sent in. 

He would have tonked or lost his wicket early. Atleast he wouldn't have faced someone like Bumrah. 

However losing Hetty early would be catastrophic for DC.",1
"Just came home from work, what happened to Chahar?",1
I thought that was out lol,1
A good over ruined.,1
Only 7 of the over,2
[removed],-4
Big booty hetty gonna smash,4
What a massive over from giant.,8
Jaa simran jaa. Jeele apni zindagi,3
Only 7 runs is still a good result for MI and Jayant.,5
"Run faster Iyer, at least put some pressure on the fielder.",5
Jayant and Boult to ex DC players coming back to bite DC,1
Hetmyer helmet pehen le.. Bumrah beamer ane wala hai,4
"Jayant Yadav did well against England, not so well in *that* Pune test and we never saw him again.",2
"DC look like they are good for 150.

Won't be enough.",1
DC just doing awesome right now. Getting big runs each over.,1
We want DC to get 190. DC will get 144 instead.,3
160 is given; anything above that is bonus,1
"Didn't let Yadav have eco <6
Moral victory?",4
Classy inside out shot. Hetmyer is good for at least one of these shots every innings,3
That's a good shot. C'mon thic boi play one superb knock to be retained for next year,3
Just rewalized KL Rahul gets the orange cap now.,9
Hetmyer hair looks like pepsi after being poured from fresh bottle,16
"Wow, Hetmeyer is in some touch",8
"*Covid : Exists* 

Big bosses with cushy seats : Literally speak to each other face to face with inches between them all the while masks pulled down to the neck.",3
Ngl this IPL final reminds me of 2010 final when MI was on top in first few overs of CSK innings and then iirc Raina(Today Pant) played rescue inning.,7
170 will be a good traget to defend in the finals for DC,2
Pant got out and Rohit immediately brought in a spinner to complete the quota. Class Captaincy!,6
"Shimron Hetmyer is the most overrated batsman in the limited overs world, CMV.",-2
s20 FE sucks don't buy it,1
A quick 40 run cameo from hetmyer will seal this game for DCüôè,2
"Someone mentioned murli on this page and swanny now calling murli turn

Coincidence ? I THINK NOT",3
Jayant is spinning the ball more than the media spins the news.,7
"Jayant bowls a great spell.

We as usual thought that he would be trash.",4
Bumrah time,2
[deleted],9
125+15 of two Bumrah+25 in two other overs we have with us 165,3
"1-25 in 4 overs is a big big win for MI. Horses for the courses, Jayant Yadav was a master move",6
The total is too low. 4 overs remaining (2 from bumrah) and the score is only 125,5
"Pant played a good innings, will not listen to anyone that says otherwise.",14
No one simps to spin as well as Murali Kartik,3
"Iyer and Pant partnership of 96 runs at 8.3 runs per over. Such a good partnership after their shitty start, and have laid a good platform for likes of Hetmyer and other hitters.",5
Beautiful shot,2
We need 40-45 runs in 4 overs and pressure of finals will make the score of 170 odd look like 190-200.,2
Shreyas lucky af today,4
"If Bumrah goes for 10+, its over for MI",1
Come on Bumrah we need better from you.,1
[deleted],5
"Oh God oh fuck, Bumrah has two overs left",2
Fuck Boom Boom is gonna rip a new stump!,3
captain's knock ‚Ñ¢,5
"Here comes the most overrated bowler of all time.

ZERO wickets so far in the match lol.",-20
In final even 160 seems like 190 so i wouldn't underestimate dc.,7
[deleted],-2
Nice Shot,2
Steve Smith is happy,5
DC need to finish strong to have any chance. Won't be easy with still 2 overs of Bumrah left.,3
Similar shot last match he got out,5
The captain standing tall,3
190 needed to be safe against Mumbai,4
Shot of the day so far.,5
FFS how many lucky runs have Delhi got,4
Never thought that Iyer and Pant would step up today,5
Can we have Left-Right Right-Left Iyer pls?,5
Jayant over Chahar today might have made difference of 10 odd runs.,-1
Hety gonna go get-y them today,1
Ganguly laughing while Arabs socialize in the background. He could be such a classy villain,11

What a combo.",5
Huh who plays a short ball like this,5
Shreyas and Pant did nothing all season and now in the final they play a good knock.,6
500 runs From Iyer this year!,14
170-175 is good imo for this Final,2
Inb4 shreyas out after scoring 50,1
"If Iyer pulls Bumrah, we can confirm that it's Ponting impersonating Iyer.",15
Going out on a limb - Delhi Capitals will win this match and take IPL trophy.,4
Boooom take him,4
Iyer is sucking out the momentum,-1
Kishan can always score a casual 188.,3
Great test innings by iyer,-3
Why is it Indian Horny League in the thread today?,7
Yar Iyer kya fayeda first ball boundary ka,5
Even after playing sub par he has still managed to score 500. Impressive but has to amp up his SR to be a successful T20 player,3
"Good spell by Jayant Yadav. Wasnt expecting much from him but he's come in clutch,",5
Can't afford to see of bumrah. You did this to yourself DC by not smacking NCN and Jaya,8
Goddamn this innings from pant and iyer was so good to watch. So confident playing each shot and playing so smartly while under pressure. Rcb take notes pls,6
Yes! Come on commentators Jinx Iyer's innings too,-1
25/1 in 4 overs. Jayant's selection was good.,3
"wait wtf? Iyer is 4th in the the leading run scorers with 502 runs. Not bad, thought he was doing a lot worse",3
Well fucking played iyer,2
Score around 165 and taking the chase to the last over would be a satisfactory performance by DC considering how unreliable we have been and how strong this MI side is.,4
Want Bumrah to have the Purple cap,2
 Why is a captain called skipper,5
Ashwin will run through MI lineup on this surface.,7
"What a knock, well player Iyer üëèüî•",1

Who the hell is this guy bowling with that awkward action. Smash him out of the ground.,7

"Swanny, if the ball is inaccessible vertically then it‚Äôs a wide. If you hit it, it‚Äôs not provided it‚Äôs the first one of the over.",5
"**17.2** Boult to Hetmyer, OUT, **steered straight to short third.** It was a slower short one outside off. He shapes to give that a spank. Is forced to rethink that and try to stab over short third man. There's just no pace on it for him to manage that. Simple catch for the fielder **137-5**

SO Hetmyer c Coulter-Nile b Boult 5 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",2
165 target?,2
Didnt even have to move a bit to catch it,2
JUST KEEP BELIEVING WELL DO THIS COME ON BOYS LETS GOOOO,5
Everything is on Iyer now.,2
Now our real batting lineup starts,1
Come on Hetty,1
Iyer to Boomrah:  Fus Ro Dah!!,2
"Calm down DC fans, back your players; don‚Äôt abuse",7
Shouldn't have checked his shot. This is the time to throw the kitchen sink at everything.,4
That‚Äôs 10 runs off the total,2
This is the best recovery you will get when the top order crumbles at 22-3,6
Lmao how would the dc players be feeling right now. Boult destroyed them in both playoffs matches.,1
Is Swann right? Should that be a no ball?,4
Shitmyer,0
"Thiccboi's shot selection was even more ridiculous than his hair.

Iyer must feel like Jon Snow in front of the Bolton army.",12
Jaa simran jaaa,1
Inb4 Delhi collapse,1
Was that over head high wide ?,2
"Is it Swann or Me who is the idiot here ?

Swann is claiming it's a no ball because it was above head height .  But above head height is actually wide and because he hit it that was a legal ball. Atleast tahts my understanding .",2
Is that a helicopter???!?,4
[deleted],3
Fuck,0
Axar at least rotate the strike wtf,1
"Every time a pandya does something well, I develop another food allergy",3
Can someone explain the rule as to why Swann is saying it should've been a no ball?,8
Hetty forgot it's not time for catch practice lol.,5
Ashwin winning it today for DC.. Just wait and watch,5
"Why the fuck is there an earth mover ad on my telly with the caption 'Bring Happiness Home'?

Who tf buys earthmovers on a whim?",6
Boult MOTM,3
Ambani wanting to see how his team is doing on that Heli?  /dont kill me,5
"Bumrah: can‚Äôt take wickets and get purple cap

Boult: Fine, i‚Äôll do it myself",8
Axar Patel gonna hit sixes,3
LORD AXAR,6
Boult is actually bowling thunder bolts! Damn.,6
This is a great 18th over by Boult...,4
Off topic but who's leading in Bihar guys,3
Axar Ganguly.,8
OMG!!! Axar what a four.,6
[deleted],37
Hetmyer looks like a giant bird took a dump on his head.,13
Why tf is delhi so shit,0
Motabhai Lite watching from helicopter to get better view,8
Get to 180 come on! üí™,3
"Hetty gets out

DC: Oh no

Mr 420 comes in to bat

DC: Anyway...",11
NCN is shit everywhere,2
"I'm happy atleast DC didn't put down the weapon after initial debacle. Even pant stepped up today. We will win next year, with more players in form and 3rd pacer",13
Discount Jadeja transcending to the next level.,5
Boult deserves purple cap.,2
"Whoever wins.
This IPl has been memorable, given the hard times and uncertainty.
Match threads have been very good and entertaining.
Felt like bantering with close friends.

Kudos to everyone !!!",33
 Ishaan Kishan don't come back,2
Axar ne maara kaskar,7
Axar >>> Krunal,18
That's a bad ball,2
Axar's batting is underrated,6
I have seen God. He bowls the first over for Mumbai Indians,18
Minimum 170 to win,3
Discount jadeja,7
It's Axar underrated patel on the crease.,5
"This season Hetmyer has played well in a total of 2 matches I believe. 

Last match and 

the one when Pant got injured, because of which Hetmyer had to sit out for the next few matches",6
Score prediction? 160 possible with Dhoni + a bowling all rounder?,2
I guess Mumbai Indians is the only 'Indian' team that doesn't bottle usually in knockout matches.,7
[deleted],7
Nortje will go for big runs tonight,2
Boult Bhai doing GOOD,5
Like can you atleast try to play well against Mumbai. Winning big against minnows doesn‚Äôt mean shit. This is the final ffs delhi,2
Only 6 here,2
How in the world Iyer has scored 500 when I can only remember him struggling for every single run all season.,29
Approaching normal Jadeja levels,2
Only one time i wanted boult to bowl a good final over defending 17 runs and he messed it up,8
Axar casually retaining the strike.,5
If MI wins i potentially win 250k. Not even joking. This is horrible,10
"Come on Axar show your frustration of not getting selected in team because of Jaddu,Krunal and Sunder",8
Can Delhi get to 160?,1
Come on DC 165 atleast,3
Why don't Mumbai ever drop catches? Or is it only against DC that they don't?,4
lets say 160 from here,1
Boult has been as important as Bumrah for us this season,6
Please Bumrah. One good over. Where is your form?,5
"6 runs off 18th over, Boult is another NZ goat",6
Jadeja lite gonna score big,4
"40 in two overs is hard to get.
Pant needed to stay till the end",3
"If MI win this game, Boult for MoM.",9
"Boult gets a wicket

MI: I see this as an absolute win

Hetmyer out, Axar in

DC: I see this as an absolute win",12
160 should be a good score given mi will be under some pressure,4
"Boult:  Shimmy Shimmy Yay, Shimmy Yay, Shimmy ya",4
I just love Axar. So much intent always!,2
"Boult

Its not Australia",7
"Its been almost 10 years since a Mumbai Player last won Orange cap/Purple cap.

We had a chance with Bumrah this year. Looks like not happening.",8
H E A V Y B A L L,1
"Even 160 looks optimistic here.

Mumbai's game for the taking.",3
"Everybody asking who is Shalu

But no one asking how is Shalu

we live in a society smh",3
Retains strike. Amazing presence of mind DC,0
NCN or Bumrah? Purple cap and he is saving yorkers for the tail I presume...,3
Axar has to channel his inner jadeja,12
This Engage ad is literally ripping off Pulp Fiction music.,2
"Bumrah you have history of good 19th over in IPL finals. Please wash, rinse, repeat.",5
"Seeing how good he was against Jadeja, I hope next season they use Axar like Narine and send him during the middle overs just to meddle with the spinners.",1
Just got a notification that Babar Azam has been appointed as the captain of test team. He's now the captain of all three formats. Shit move tbh. Too much on him,5
We are making it very difficult for our bowlers. Has been impressive but have to finish at 170 for a decent chance,3
Need 30 from here but will be hard with a Bumrah over,3
165 on the board is not a bad total considering its a final,0
160 is a decent score but need to take the top3 out quickly,3
"160 easy

170+ difficult

Bell curve in between",6
"Friendly reminder - Sourav Ganguly (BCCI president) used to one of the head coaches/mentors of DC's team.

Hmmmmmmmmm.......",-2
160 is going to be tough for MI üòî,2
160 is a bare minimum. If they don't get to that. It's over for DC,4
bc this Jayant Yadav was also in Delhi?,7
"So, NCN for the final over. That's gone be a challenge for MI",2
Life comes full circle when Bumrah gets Iyer.,0
Need min 10 from this bum over,1
only time that iyer can beat rohit is fifa20 in mutualfunds ad,13
6 runs and a wicket in the 18th over is ridiculously good.,7
Hopefully can keep under 160,0
"I was wondering, what if you had a spinner who was a midget (say 5' to 5'2"" tall). Do you think a spinner like that would be harder to play? Ball wouldn't come up as much.",1
Man commentators again calling Axar underrated.,4
"Cometh the hour, cometh the man!!

A certain Dhoni showed up in a final  like this in 2011.",-3
Need at least 170 vs MI,3
DC needs atleast 165 to make a match of it.,3
165 wins you the final DC. Kammonnn!!!,2
Bum plz,1
"**First time 3 bowlers have taken 25 or more wickets in an IPL season**

29 Rabada

27 Bumrah

25 Boult",11
"Literally every MI batsman is in form, 160 just doesn't seem enough",5
I hate the mg hector ads why would you have random British people in an ad directed at Indians,6
"Kishan has to face some penalty for not fielding 14 overs, right?",0
RIyan Parag [https://twitter.com/ParagRiyan/status/1326181871277862912](https://twitter.com/ParagRiyan/status/1326181871277862912),8
_Bumrah hack activated_,6
That was the first slower ball in this match by memory,2
Let's hold them under 160!,1
Swanny's got some tight ass pants,1
"Chutiya audience Bumrah for purple cap, Sureee",4
This over will be a yorker fest and someone's going home before this over ends.,1
Iyer has played a decent innings but he really needed to have gone big here,4
Feels like MI will chase this 18-19 overs... unless Rabada bowls like an absolute dream. That wicket of Stoinis upfront has costed DC at the back end.,2
Mehenga natrajan,1
Great comeback. Happy with the Shreyas pant innings even if we lose,3
Bumrah and Yorkers. Name a better love story,-1
Looks like a decent batting surface they would need more than 160 to defend,0
[deleted],5
Get to 160 ffs,5
Swanny is on some shit,4
I haven‚Äôt seen the MI Netflix documentary but did the owner‚Äôs son behave like a dick or something?,9
Still got the yorkers alright,3
Delhi has given up haven't they,0
Boult was with DC. DC ruing trading him for no player I guess.,1
Bye bye 170.,4
"That's ballsy from Iyer, showing leg stump to Bumrah so he can bowl Yorker and possibly get hit for 4",2
"170 minimum needed imo, that MI lineup is stacked",1
"Need 165 frm here

Come on DC bois",2
bowl ash first over?,3
"Wtf, atleast swing the bat",4
I have said this before. I will say it again : Bumrah's fulltosses don't get punished enough.,7
Four 4s off bumrah please.,3
Good recovery from 22-3 but target less than 165 will be too difficult to defend,5
Good fight by Delhi,1
Edged?,0
Looked way outside the line..,2
Umpires call unless it's bat,3
Edged,1
Just 8 balls remaining. DC should go for big shots,1
India test captain JiNx 14 avg in IPL,0

"‚ÄúWho will win the purple cap?‚Äù 

Rabada wears his helmet.",3

Hurts to see such Bumrah out of form.,-3
Looked like bat,1
not out,-1
Looks out,1
Tactical review,4
"**Wicket-keeper scoring fifty or more in an IPL final**

Could be out...,1
Impact outside off,1
Bumrah getting desperate to win the purple cap lol,4
Looks out,-1
Imagine if pant took that review.,2
Bumrah wants the purple cup,6
Outside the line,2
Good save now make it count Iyer please,4
Wtf there's bat,0
36.2% of the ball lol,4
Hetmyr was required to hit a few sixes,1
"Wp dc , better luck next time",0
I think to make this game more fair pandya and pillar should play for DC right now,1
Out,-2
Thank fuck.,2
"OUT !!!!!!! 
Tha...",0
Fkin Umpires call,3
good review,2
Looked outside off,0
Umpire's call bc,5
"160 with finals pressure is equivalent to 170-175.

If DC can get De Kock and SKY early, they can make a match of this for sure. Rohit is in poor form plus a slow starter. Ishan is also a slow starter.",6

Bumrah not winning purple cap official,1
That isn't even umpires call. It's outside off clearly,0
No Purple capü§ß,1
Lol this came full circle,2
Umpire's call is chutiya rule,2
great over,2
Should‚Äôve been a runout,0
"The wicket seems like it‚Äôs holding up and slowing down abit, a lot of turn as well for ashwin dubey and axar",3
Well congratulations Rabada for purple cap,7
Congratulations Rabada on winning the purple cap,9
Saved but two reds should be overturned,1
Axar fulltoss ko toh maar ache se,3
Wtf impact umpires call ? Kuch bhi,4
Why it was not out?,3
"This game has got 2013 final vibes, but only this time MI is on the opposite side of the situation. All it needs is Iyer not getting enough strike during the final over to mirror Pollard",4
"Bumrah is fantastic with econ rate in every format. Just lacks a bit when it comes to picking wickets. The thing is Shami with SR makes up for it. And they manage to compliment each other.

I reckon all Bumrah needs to do is work on/get coached in picking the wicket straight on his first over like what Amir did. He'll be a complete monster then",3
Sexy running,2
I will never understand how So many full tosses go unpunished...,3
Scoreboard guy already gave wicket in timeline,4
Congrats on the Purple Cap Rabada,5
Shit went from 100 to 0 real quick.,2
Impact shouldn't be umpire's call,1
Fair enough. Funny remembering Bumrah didn't want to review for his test hattrick ball but really wanted that.,3
Why didn‚Äôt axar go for it ?,1
Ouch. Review retained at least,1
"Credit to Iyer and Pant for making a match out of this. After 4 overs, this looked like a bloody one sided affair, unless MI still chases this within 17.3 overs!",5
"For sure MI is more likely to win this match, But DC fans, be proud of this team.


We used to be a meme team who competed for 6th 7th and 8th position and now we qualified for playoffs twice in a row and playing a Finale today.



Today's match was poised to become a repeat of Qualifier 1 but the captain and WK stepped up and got the team to a respectable total. 


Even if we lose, that's fine, we are losing to the best after all.",13
You gotta wonder how high profile players like Rohit can let themselves go like he has,5
DC choking again.,-1
"His front pad saved him lol. If that didn't clip the front pad and hit the back pad first, that's out",1
So rabada gets the purple cap?,4
GOAT over so far. Perhaps match changing,7
15 frm last over come on DC,6
"Umpire's call, eh?

*grabs popcorn*",11
Rabada purple cap!!!,7
Its ok bumrah. We are proudd of you ‚ô•,9
Why is Axar not even attempting a slog? This is the 19th over,6
I never understood why the ball has to hit in line AND hit the stumps? Shouldn't it be out if the ball is hitting the wickets regardless of hitting in line or not?,10
Need some Ben Cutting magic in the last over for DC,5
Wicket less bumrah,2
DC is in deep shit rn. Jeez,5
Rabada gets his cap,3
Ah classic 6 run 19th over from Bumrah,10
"Guys 6 sixes please, kthx.",10
Well at least Rabada still has the purple cap. Those wickets amounted to fuck all in all matches but he still got them.,8
"Brilliant over, need one more good one here.",2
Axar had to try to cunt that.,8
"Well played Delhi, didn't give anything to Bunrah. 7.25 per Bumrah over without a wicket is gold",7
Cred has nice ads,4
"40 runs off last 5 overs, what a match are we having",3
2 of those yorkers were botched and good to hit. That's why good IPL performances don't mean you are international quality.,6
170 is up to Iyer Now,4
Rabada with the purple cap üòäüòäüòäüòäüòä,7
No wicket for Bumrah but he‚Äôs bowled like a champion,14
"155 final score?

NCN is bowling so make it 160",2
Master of death bowling,5
"NcN has been in good form today, Hope he doesn't give 12.",2
They need to aim for 165 here,3
If 160+ Then Delhi wont go down that easily.,6
Bumrah Keeps bowling Full Tosses and Commentators keep calling it Yorkers. üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠,13
Fucking hell....how does one get away with so many full tosses,3
Need a 15-20 run over rn.,2
Is it 3 full tosses for 3 runs in 19th over...lol,3
Axar wasted 2 nice full toss from Bumrah,8
Good to know the purple cap will go to the most deserving player now.,2
So many full tosses and yet they couldn‚Äôt do anything more than defending,0
"If you are not gonna hit bumrah on full tosses, WTF are you expecting from him. FFS",4
"Any signs of dew, Bumrah not nailing Yorkers?",3
Need 15 at least of this. Anything less and we have zero momentum,5
"If Delhi tried to play Boult the same way they played Boom, might have been a better score but I hope they do their best",2
This is a very MumbaiInFinalesque total so far,4
What is wrong with these batsman? These are rank full tosses wth.,4
Stupid impact rule is why this game is too batsman friendly,6
Did Sharma just injure himself again?,4
NCN please,0
Really could've sent Ashwin ahead of this clown,1
Rabada smiling with his death over wickets,4
"Jasprit "" I am okay with not getting wickets and winning the tournament"" Bumrah really wanted to drive that point in",7
Will take anything less than 15 runs from NCN,3
What makes Boult so much more successful with new ball as opposed to Bumrah. Boult always picking up 1-2 wickets on power play.,3
"So, they settle for 160?",1
Iyer is a great accumulator better suited for ODIs,4
woeful batting,3
Losing Pant and Hetmyer really hurt Delhi's death overs accelaration. Going to be tough to defend this now,1
DC needed to make atleast 182 for De Cock or Kishan to score 188 and get the orange cap. Cmon DC,5
Bumrah's low full tosses are harder to hit because of his action,1
DC need to take NCN to the cleaners to get a formidable total.,2
Iyer can't seem to find a boundary to save his life.,5
Easy win for Mumbai,6
Did anyone else see rohit struggle to pick the ball up on the last ball?,7
Iyer played a typical odi inning,0
The point of impact has occurred...no prediction in that.... only hitting or missing should be umpire's call,2
Feel like this is going to be a snoozer,10
Why are we batting like we need 150 to win.,6
I am too nervous to on tv now pls tell me who is bowling?,3
"Running a single of the first ball.

Moronic",2
My mans gonna finish with a strike rate of 130. Absolute state.,1
made it look like bumrash was going to ball again,1
Anukul roy the motm,6
Discount jadeja gone,2
MI pulled the match back. They looked set for 170 after 14th.,7
Fuck,2
What‚Äôs the highest purple cap count ever?,2
"DC might have stayed afloat after those early wickets. 

But this just isn't going to be enough to defeat MI.",2
Please DC. Have one good over. Show us you aren't trash,3
Congratulations MI,3
Momentum back with MI,3
Lmao guys atleast hit 160,3
Poor from axar today,1
Axar is no Jadeja at batting.,3
Coulter Nile: Bowl slow get wickets,1
Well DC are over par or under par hmmmmm,2
Anukul Roy is everywhere.,2
If SRH made it through to final the contest would have been interesting,2
Yeah we are losing this. Gg mumbai.,1
So many emojis here in this thread.. we don't do that on reddit,3
NCN finally in some form,1
No way DC (or any other team for that matter) can defend a score of 150+ against this MI side.,5
MI‚Äôs permanent sub at play,2
Interesting day today. Bumrah: 0 wickets. NCN: 2 wickets.,2
Ffs Axar. You had one job to do. Now Lord Rahane will take singles.,-3
Bumrah doing what he says. ' I'm happy to go wicketless if we find the tournament'.,3
Remember when Rahul had his hair tied up like that?,1
Thank you Shitmyer for ruining the momentum,3
"*Axar patel dismissal exists*

Sad Sanjay Manjarekar noises",3
"Even though Delhi will win this game, but I must acknowledge that the field placement has been great.",3
Bumrah purple cap :(,3
My man anukul roy,3
ANUKUUUULLLL,3
And the Sub again,3
"I still think for T20, they should increase the over limit for bowlers from 4 to 5.

It's too damn batsman friendly already. And would make games more interesting to watch the best bowlers bowl more.",3

These slow balls are death,5
So.... what do you guys make of the pitch?,0
The fireworks are scary af tbh,4
Imagine having all the advanced technology but still relying on Umpires call to make the final decision.,4
come on bcs 170 atleast.,1
Will ishan come out to bat?,2
Guys can someone tell me why outside ball hitting stumps not out ?,2
"Iyer please I am saying this for 100th time probably, but cunt it, this is not enough. Play all the remaining balls",3
"Delhi aren't even getting to 160

160 is the minimum they need. Also pace off the ball into the surface is definitely the way to go on this pitch",8
Why would you hit at the best fielder in the world rn.,7
Rabada with the purple cap is some consolation I suppose. Dude better come out and take a 5-fer tonight,2
Playing NCN over Pattitson paid off for MI.,6
DC 20-25 runs short,1
Hetmyer should have been here but he had to play a shit shot,5
"Now that I think about it, Pant played better than Iyer",4
"Here an Anukul, there an Anukul, everywhere an Anukul.",3
"Iyer has to get 15 off the last 4 balls else this game is already over. 165 is under par too, but at least they are in with a shot",3
Anukul Roy is definitely an upgrade over Saurabh Tiwary when it comes to substitute fielder üòÉ,5
"So many players trapped in this innings!

This shows how well the team is balanced.",3
Underwhelming death performance after a good foundation.,7
Specialist fielder in play!,5
Bumrah losing the purple cap feels worse than losing the cup,2
kishan ruled out as per Bhogle tweet,5
Everyone getting wickets except Bumrah :-(,3
"Ishan not back on the field yet,that‚Äôs a bit concerning",2
"Delhi playing the last three overs the same way they played the first 3.

Absolutely brain dead cricket.",7
"Again that substitute fielder, I mean is Kishan still injured ? But I'm sure he will bat. Cheating fucks MI",-1
"Hi Rabada, good luck, at least you got the purple cap to take home",4
149 is not enough against mumbai. Game will be over in 17th over. MI just too good.,2
Iyer hog the strike and hit a couple of sixes here.,3
"BTW, I think Pawan Negi also played as a specialist fielder this year for RCB.",3
GG Rabada on the purple cap,6
Don't think Kishan's been back after that injury. If he stays out MI might be in a bit of trouble,4
The total is pretty low. I can see MI win this quite comfortably.,6
"Ambani rn and also at other times but rn too:

Cash rules everything around me  
CREAM, get the money  
Dollar dollar bill, y'all",-1
"Shreyas‚Äô batting cost us the final? Not surprised he‚Äôs cost us another match, but I expected him to grow a brain by the fucking final.",-1
At least Iyer's back on strike,1
"**19.2** Coulter-Nile to Patel, OUT, **dragged straight to deep midwicket.** Slower short ball outside off. Nothing on that for the pull. Axar invited to make all the power on his shot and he can only hit it to Anukul who is a few yards inside **149-6**

AR Patel c sub (AS Roy) b Coulter-Nile 9 (9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",2
Iyer having his old non hitting flashbacks,3
Anukul Roy:- Specialist Substitute player,2
Underpar. Only solace that our overall bowling lineup is better.,1
"MI have scored above 149 in only one of their five finals, right?",5
"Anukul Roy always takes one catch at least, LMAO.",1
Mumbai win it for the billionth time,4
They could have pushed a bit more here. Not sure why they slowed down after reaching 130 odd runs.,4
Coulter Nile is back to form,1
Anyone else think the purple/orange cap should be awarded before the play-off stage? So all players get same number of games,6
Behnchod wtf is DC doin!!!,1
feel bad for DC. unfortunate,5
"Only once has Mumbai Indians failed to chase a target in this season and it still went into the super-over!!

Pack it up, Boys.",5
So it's just a matter now of in what over MI win this,5
Will ishan play?,1
Can Iyer do a 2019 pollard ?,2
DC hoped for Saurabh Tiwary instead of Anukul Roy there,3
Lol. They were 100 at 13th over. Shitty batting.,5
This ain't it.,2
FFS,2
Bowling needs to show up today if dc wants to Have the slightest chance,2
Rahane has probably played his last IPL,4

its Iyer's job to accelerate. But he has not showed ability to brutally attack. Disappointing total. MI batting is way too strong to miss this one.,1
"Kagiso Rabada is now Purple Cap winner of IPL 2020. He's the second South African pacer after Morne Morkel to win the Purple Cap, overall 3rd after Morkel and Imran Tahir.",8
Ponting getting substitute fielder flashbacks,8
Iyer should have done better in death overs considering he is a set batsman,8
NCN please bowl these last 3 good. Under 160 is good,3
"Have said it time and again, Iyer is a liability to the team. Strikes me as a selfish player",-1
Shreyas man if you've an ounce of shame pls get this to 160 that is all that's needed to give yourself a chance next innings,2
MI has pretty well stopped the flow of runs in the past 3 overs,14
This is clownery,3
Anukul has a face like pant lol ‡≤†_‡≤†,2
You guys should stop jinxing mumbai I'm scared,2
Nice bowling my NCN,3
They should give him an award for his commitment and performance on the field as a super-sub,4
It's alright an awesome over by NCN,9
Wtf is going on,5
Thala Iyer,0
Shreyas : I'm the Rahane now,2
Iyer sus,3
Wicket looks like a sticky one . Might not be easy to bat second,5
Iyer is terrible at the death lol,3
Sigh so painful,3
Absolute shithousery this.,8
"Iyer my dude, deep breaths",4
Oof iyer,1
MI bowlers brought themselves back in the game in last 5 overs :(,5
Why is Shreyas struggling so much? Is the pitch slowing down? We have a great match then,3
Iyer is sus,2
Nice odi innings from captain Iyer.,-1
tatti last 5 overs üò≠,4
NCN has impressed today,8
CMON 150 please.,3
I hope Rabada and Nortje are taking notes.,5
What the heck man. Somebody tell Iyer it‚Äôs the last over,0
Wow 1 run in 4 balls in the final over.,5
Ah shit here we go again. Another mi win. I can't fucking take it,4
Yea 150 isn't enough. GG Delhi you were good for the most part this IPL,1
There's our indian cricket teams no. 4 finisher,3
Come on...,1
wow bhenchod,2
"Can Ankul Roy bat too,if he can we can take him over KP who hits good once in a blue moon!!If he can't bat an we groom him like all others??",1
Shot!,2
24 runs off the last 22 balls though not a lot of wicket have fallen. Gold standard death bowling right there!,8
absolute failure of the DC captiain,0
Coulter nile playing an end innings cameo here. Great game so far,1
One more six. They need one more.,0
Fuck off Iyer. 31 off last 30 balls lol,4
I haven't been following the match. So taking that into context is this a good innings from Iyer? SR on the lower side,2
Anukul roy has been handy.,2
Only 30 odd runs off the last 5 isn't acceptable at all,2
Looking forward to burning effigies of Shreyas Iyer with my delhi friends!,-2
NCN back in form ? Match of the out of forms this ?,3
Oh captain my captain,3
DC making Coulter Nile look like peak malinga,16
Tried the Slow ball one too many,2
160 please,5
Has the pitch slowed down?,5
Come on Iyer,3
"> Game's gone for Delhi.

> Pant's idiotic shot and Hetmyer being a bigger moron cost them the chance to get to 170- 180.

This is an actual comment (upvoted also) in this thread. Who is to blame in this match?

Dhawan? No

Stoinis? No

Rahane? No

Pant who batted with 145+ SR after a collapse? Hell yes",142
That made a great sound off the bat,5
Jofra Archer is the winner of Most Valuable Player of the Tournament award.,14
Gets a connection finally,7
NCN got away with bowling a lot of filth,10
...,3
Hitting sixes will not change the Dot balls you played mate,-3
Finally Iyer show your potential,6
Shreyeas shouldve upped his SR. Cmon mannn youve played enough balls to have been set,5
Rabada will surpass malinga it looks like,8
"DC managed to take down 1

Now just need to send Hulk Boy Stoinis to beat down the remaining 10",4
Lol they won't even get to 160,1
Hahaha to think I was dreaming of 175. Dedh sau banane me chudi hui hai in chutiyon ko,2
Pretty good total with the bowling lineup that DC has.   The pressure of a final could also play on our minds.,2
"Shreyas Iyer looking helplessly, probably at Rohit ""Bid for me next season re""",7
Great last over by NCN.,6
Good knock by Shreyas iyer,10
*Game Over*,2
57-4 from last 7 overs,2
"Let's be honest, not many of you thought we would reach 155. So at least appreciate that we have something on the board.",50
150 is nothing burger.,8
How embarrassing for DC.,2
Brilliant last over from NCN,6
Diamond duck for Rabada,10
Shreyas should teach kholi what a captain's knock in a knockout game is,4
In hindsight it's a very good recovery after being 22-3 but you still feel they are a good 15-20 or even a bit more short here.,17
"Rabada is the second batsman this season to get a diamond fuck


Edit - duck",19
How come Kishan can stay off the field for like the whole first innings? Was he ever on the field?,0
Advantage MI,6
Well played Delhi.,3
"Game over lol, no way this is gonna be defended",-3

You guys are way too defeatist. DC might do fine.,11
One more please,3
"NCN showed up when it mattered!!

Worth the  8 Cr spent",12
"What's the lowest total defended in a final, 129?",13
Good death bowling to end the innings for Mumbai. Delhi did well after their horror start. Think they're maybe 10-15 short but they've got a chance at least.,2
"Not great, but atleast something to fight for. Iyer could have done more but he was trying atleast.",4
DC short by 50 runs. Good luck to them they will need it.,-1
this is so embarrassing for delhi i can‚Äôt even,-1
Great game overall so far.. Would have loved 10 more runs for DC though,1
Advantage delhi with their bowling line-up,1
"Mumbai should chase that, just need someone to go big.",3
38/2 off the last 5. MI will take it I reckon,8
20 runs short.,3
"MI got away with those last two overs, lots of full tosses and bad deliveries.",6
Damn ncn came through in the final game. Wonder if they hold on to him for next season.,5
DC is at least 20-30 runs short,2
Can't blame Iyer at all for this score. Wtf are y'all on. Top order failure yet again.,16
157 to win with dew and 3 spinners in the opposition. I have a bad feeling about this,5
Rabada/Nortje combo should nab their South African teammate first.,3
Good fight considering we were down three wickets so quickly,8
Only 38 runs in last 5 overs,6
Goodluck defending a mediocre score with 3 spinners against Pollard and Pandu bros. Anything above 35 in powerplay and DC are toast. They‚Äôre toast anyways but then they‚Äôre burnt toast,2
What a shit decision to bat first.,-4
"Win or lose, I am still moderately happy for the team. Not a bad comeback. Would've liked 170. But this is still much more than what we looked like getting.",4
Respectable score but have to get Mumbai top 4 down early,1
Threw away the advantage in the last 5 overs again.,2
"20 runs short again. Anyway face saver score, well played.",2
[deleted],3
this won‚Äôt be enough for delhi,2
Delhi 25 runs short!,3
The pitch seems to have slowed down. It looks difficult to bat on now.,2
"Dissapointing 1st innings , can't have shit in 2020",1
Rabada gonna get thrashed by Quinton.,2
Congratulations to Mumbai Indians for winning their fifth IPL,-1
"no total is small or big, enough in a final..even 150 can be tricky‚Ñ¢ to chase",3
"Bumrah had an average game(by his standards) but Boult and Coulter Nile have been exceptional. The last 3 overs pulled back things after the middle overs assault. Good outing for Yadav as well.

Chasable score but Mumbai has defended lower scores in a final. Need a solid performance from one of the top order batsman.",7
15-20 runs short,4
So many fucking pessimistic cunts over here.,4
[removed],2
What should the score in the pp be if dc have to even stand a chance?,2
DC have a chance with early wickets,3
Wouldn't been surprised if the umpire went to 3rd umpire to check that run out. That's the standard they've set this year,3
38 runs off final 5 overs; WTF Mumbai,5
Both fringe player of our XI i.e NCN and Jayant yadav performed really well today.,3
"Considering 22-3, decent total but MI favourites to win",9
Doesn't looks a good wicket to bat..  couple of wickets and anything can happen..,5
WHY DID I HAVE HIGH HOPES....,4
"The only two guys who didn't fire, fired for us today.",2
If Hitmyer stuck around it would have been 160-170 but well I dont wanna ask much after 22-3. I hope the bowling has a miracle day today,7
Give my man Anucool Roy a Green cap too,5
"Rabada 6-wicket maiden incoming lads, don't you worry",10
Honestly proud of the team after loosing 3 wickets in the start still came here but they needed a better finish axar and hetmyer didn't delivered it,8
"Well played, Delhi! You guys should be thankful to Iyer and Pant for this score.

Let's hope that we don't fuck up during the chase, this is a good score considering it's a final",5
Rabada and nortje have to take hat tricks  in powerplay to make a match of it,6
Well played Delhi. No other team could have bounced back like you did. MI strong favorites.,4
"Thank God, Pant & Iyer performed well. otherwise it would be the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise.",3
"Need a rabada special now

A corker first up like the last one to warner",2
"What happened to that teenager bowler of MI, Rasikh Salam?",3
Will Rohit force himself back to form?,1

"Next year ipl should add category for super subs ..

Roy is unlucky just to get match fees game after game.",3
"Ok, for what it's worth.. I have been far from convinced from NCN this season.

But he delivered with the ball tonight.. Quality stuff.",5
bro rohit himself will have this target for dinner,4
Rabada wins the purple cap!,5
Hetmyer wicket changed the match tbh.,8
"Just 8 runs in death?

DC pushing NCN to stand neck to neck with Boult n Bumrah.",6
130 SR is for opening batsmen. For a middle order like Iyer he should have played like however he wanted since the top order collapsed but when it came to middle over he should have accelerated and as a middle order im pretty sure he has been guided to know how to do so. Those 10 runs added wouldve been crucial,-1
Why this dc fans are so hopeless 156 is fucking good score in the final,13
Has the pitch slowed down or did DC really fucked up here?,1
"Bumrah still candidate for Man of the Series?  


2 less wickets than the lead with higher strike rate and better economy. (KL could've been it if KXIP had atleast qualified)",7
Come on MI try to chase well.,5
Delhi short by about 65 runs lol. Let's pray Purple Cap takes a hat trick today,1
"To continue the trend, Vadapavman gonna score big today",5
Not enough runs on the board but whatever. At least we got this far and didn‚Äôt get totally embarrassed this time.,7
Jayant and ncn the unlikely stars for us so far.,4
DC: it ain't much but it's honest work.,5
"Cakewalk for MI, Congrats taporis",-1
"DC cant defend this I feel, MI batting is too deep and strong",1
Rabada should be docked one wicket for getting out without facing a ball.,2
Idk why ppl r shitting on iyer he was a major reason why they even got to 156,31
Below par score but I don't hate it.,6
"Bumrah might have gone wicketless today but atleast his ER was on point.

Oh wait..",8
"It's final lads, anything can happen",8
Stop bitchin about low score. Let mi bat atleast. Even if they chase it dc did good recovery. I,9
"*Top order collapses*

RCB: We know how it feels bro. Goodluck reaching 150

DC: Watch me. Bencho",13
Shitemyer,1
"Just curious, have 61L viewers ever watched an IPL match before? Pretty sure it was around 50L last year finals.",5
Good score after the dreadful start and the fact that they almost never recover from shit starts. Game is set up nicely.,5
"Delhi played well so far but Mumbai are just too good , we  just can't beat them.",2
"As long as MI make good use of the powerplay, this is a chasable score especially if the dew comes on",3
"They need, _need_ - at least 2 early wickets.",5
Now send shaw to mix cough syrup in Mumbai‚Äôs Gatorade.,12
I think we're 15 runs short but I'll back our bowlers. Let's do this Delhi!,6
COME ON RABADA,6
"Rahane should have stayed, if he is there for stabilising the innings he has done the opposite always except that 1 game.",5
157 in an IPL final is tricky. Let's wait and watch.,8
The trend with MI has been the usual top batsmen don‚Äôt perform and the others make up for it; it‚Äôs been a similar story but with Bowlers today,2
"MI bat till 9, Less than 5% chance of DC winning this.",3
10-15 runs short. They've done well after the top order fuck up though,8
"Very chaseable. Gonna need at least two of our top order batsmen to show up (QdK, Rohit, SKY, IK) and set a good foundation.

I have complete faith in our closers (Hardik and Pollard) to smash us to a win if they're set up well.",5
"**Highest scores by a captain in an IPL final**

69 - David Warner, 2016

**64 - Shreyas Iyer, 2020**

63* - MS Dhoni, 2013

54 - Virat Kohli, 2016

51 - Steve Smith, 2017

50 - Rohit Sharma, 2015",11
MI needed to restrict them to 130-140. 155 is a bridge too much for a final for MI,-1
15 runs short at the end but how things went at the beginning decent. Just hope it won't be walkover like 2018 final,6
People forget Delhi were 22-3 yet got to 156.,5
"Mumbai will definitely lose here. Only Pollard is a big game player over there. Rohit, De Kock, SKY and Kishan will get out for less than 20. Hardik will hit a couple of sixes and get out",7
Dont know why everyone is shitting on Iyer. No one else put up a fight other than him and Pant.,18
Hoping for 5-3 in 3.4 overs in an Indians scorecard,13
"Delhi woulda happily taken 156 after being 22/3, but at one stage after the fightback they would have hoped for 165 or 170.",13
Everyone forgetting this is Mi and they were 22/3 in the powerplay lmao,15
"Delhi‚Äôs strike rate- (156/120)*100 = 130

Iyer‚Äôs strike rate- (65/50)*100 = 130",13
65 (50) is meh,-3
shreyas is not a good finisher. Heytmeyer might have done better in pushing it to 170,5
We'll have a bat first,1
MI chollapse incoming.,4
"I told that in last game

If fuckers cant hit Sandeep Sharma in death, how tf do u expect them to hit Boult n Bumrah?",5
inb4 MI doesn't shit the bed again,5
Credit to MI in the death.,6
Did not think they would get here after their terrible start. Good job DC!,4
This is MI's game to lose now... Restricted DC to a chase-able target in the finals. Number 5 is coming.,1
Batting the entire inning to get only 65 of 50 isn‚Äôt as impressive when you‚Äôre considered the best batter in the team,1
Great score from Delhi considering that horrible start.,5
What kind of universe will permit MI to win in an even year?,4
Jayant Yadav would make a good commentator/analyst after he retires,3
170 was on man cmon...exceptional bowling tbh,3
"Are people legitimately blaming iyyer rn? for this particular match? Only one other batsman connected his shots convincingly, axar, hetty, flopped. Our top order collapsed, we're at a semi fightable target because of him.

Do redditors' memory go back only 2 overs?",42
Jayant Yadav reminds me of Jayantilal Gada,3
"157 is actually a decent total when you factor in the pressure of it being a final but MI have done this shit so many times, it's basically just another game for them..",11
"38 runs of the last 5 overs is shit, MI are going to chase this in 16-17 overs",2
DC fans shitting on Iyer if it wasn't for him DC would have collapsed,14
"20 runs in the last 3 overs, what a comeback by MI",4
Maybe they should‚Äôve persisted with Shaw coz Rahane has done nothing better,0
It‚Äôs a good wicket to bat on. If MI gets a good start and a strong opening partnership they can walk right through them. Need to play Rabada carefully. Hitman should watch out for Ash and Axar.,3
What is the lowest total delhi defended this year?,4
150 is brilliant for a final but the standards from MI have me a bit disappointed that we couldn‚Äôt restrict them to ~125 or 130,3
As an MI fan I am always anxious when Mumbai come to bat. Them chasing is giving me 2010 falshbacks.,4
Mumbai Indians needs 157 to win IPL 2020 and their 5th IPL title. Ishan Kishan won't be allowed to bat before the 13th over as he was off the Field.,1
"**First Innings totals in IPLfinal**

< 160: Mat 4 | Won 4 | Lost 0

DC needs to pick up a sky blue shade of its color. Contrasts too much with mumbais,1
"Well! At least DC made a match of this (I'd like to think so). They have the bowling to test MI. And if they lose wickets early, does SKY come and play that freely considering this is a Final?",2
MI got batting up to no 9 today with NCN and Giant in the team.,3

"Every season Mumbai struggles in parts of the tournament but produce their best in the finals. 4 titles out of 5 finals is phenomenal record in itself.

Any word about Kishan?,3
157 in a final against Rabada/Nortje/Ashwin isn't gonna be easy. hope MI gets through the powerplay without much damage.,6
[deleted],3
Great temperament from pant and Iyer considering the pressure of the final. All this really is good for the Indian team in the long run,7
"8 out of 12 final were won batting first.

Also mi defended 156 below scores 3 times in final.",6
Cricbuzz calling it a competitive total. Why they giving false hope like this.,1
You'd back MI to chase this total down easily,3
"If it was any other team, I'd say this was a below par score. But with Rabada and Nokia on Delhi's side, I'd say it's just enough. 

Game on.",5
another year of mi win.. this dominance of mi csk makes ipl boring,4

Iyer and Pant do bat well together,7

65(50) after 22-3 is a pretty good knock,13
"DC form looked like a sine wave, they peaked in the middle and were bad at the start and end.",5
"Once again proven that Iyer is no Pant. If Pant stayed till 20th over,the score would've been well over 180. But good innings from Iyer none the less considering the situation he came in.",5
Reserve comments on the Iyer innings after the match is over. It‚Äôs either a masterclass or disaster class till then.,9
Iyer pls use bowlers wisely ffs,5
"I don‚Äôt know, man. At one point it looked unlikely Delhi would get 150, then it looked like 180 was on.

"Stoinis needs to bowl his full quota, since he can bowl great slower and yorker balls",2
Interesting how DC would have gladly taken a score of 156 if they were offered at the end of 4 overs. And yet now they'd feel they missed out after the solid platform at the end of 12 overs.,2
Stoinis was doing decently in the middle order this season but Shaw and Rahane shit the bed so hard as openers they had to move Stoinis up the order.,4
I wish the finals was a best to 3 of something similar,4
"Okay obviously the Galactic Sith Lord Empire are favourites against the Rebel Delhi Alliance, but India scored 157/5 and won by 5 runs in the first WT20 final. There's hope yet for Rishabh Skywalker and Shreyas Solo.",8

They gave too much respect to Bumrah who was pretty hittable today.,1
Match is not over. Chasing in a final is always tricky. I would say its 51-49 MI right now.,1

"Rahane in the team to avoid collapse


Ponting : You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.",19
156 in final is a defendable score. Rohit needs to show his class today.,8
Ashwin and Rabada are gonna make or break this game I feel,6
SKY based on current form probably the most important batsman if we want to chase this easily,8
Iyer was 26 (24) of the last  balls he faced..,6

Jayant was getting good turn and DC has 3 good spinners,6
"10% chance that we win this. Although proud to support this team, we did our best with half of batsmen out of form. Entertaining IPL, glad they organized it.",10
Iyer could have hit few more runs in the end. Nevertheless its great knock in a pressure game,1
MI need a very good start. Hitman bat normal. Give yourself some time.,1

DJ Bravo 32 (18 matches)

Rabada 29 (17* matches)

Match will be interesting if he gets there",5
there is something wrong with DC which is extremely difficult to crack. How can they be so dominating sometimes and so powerless on other days.. just don‚Äôt get it,10
its on Rabada to bowl a dream spell and get couple of wickets.,2
Hardik needs to come through. ü§û,1
*Remembers Punter telling Ash to use Running out on the other end tactically at the business end*,5
"I was in school. 50s to Iyer and Pant was good to see, even tho we will lose",3
"Are we gonna see a mankad today???

I wish",14
"Looking at what happened, today's the day Rohit comes into form and rest of the 10 MI batsmen shit the bed",5
"Delhi definitely did well to get to 156 from 22/3 but at 100 in 13 overs, they will rue missing 170/175. Anyway, decent score for a final, less have been defended, if they can bowl well they will make it tough for MI. There‚Äôs a match to be had here.",11
"The important thing is that the pant we know and love wasn't gone, just needed a high pressure situation to say fuck it to bewda and koach's advice .",8
Iyer is rahane 2.0 in T20s. I can already see his majestic 40(35) in the upcoming wc semis,8
I don't expect much from Rohit today. Even if he gets 25+ I'll be over the moon.,4
Somehow only MI fans have any hope for DC,8
"Pant finally fuckking scores...  

Iyer wasted few balls later in his innings... but that is fine with me... atleast he saved us from humiliation",8
Lara thinks MI would win whereas Swanny is rooting for DC to win. Interesting,5
‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt care about the process. Only the result‚Äù.,9
Proud of the boys of having reached here.. Whatever happens. Now hoping for a KG special,1
Can Rabada and Nortje bowl their best opening spell of their lives? This total is defendable if they blow the top of the batting lineup.,2
"If DC has to win this, they need to bowl Rabada and Nokia for 8 overs on the trot 

And ofcourse pray

Edit: Joke tha, haasna tha.",1
We are doomed if brohit breaks his bad run today.,3
Ashwin BC bowl off spin. There is enough turn. No doosra nonsense!,6
TIL Ricky Ponting has won the World Cup 3 times! Also - he has been one of Australia's most successful captains.,7
"Want someone from MI to remind Rabada and Nortje that it's a final match.


PS: We need to protect De Kock from hearing this at all costs :P",7
DC need a hulk special yet again today,6
Unless entire batting lineup collapses we are winning this one,5
"Okay, so danger batsmen :

Rohit De Kock Surya Kishan Hardik Pollard. Man that's asking for 6 quick wickets....",2
Kannum Kannum Nokia to be matchwinner today,2
Unpopular Opinion: On paper DC's team is better,7
Dugout reminded me of Inside the NBA. Just a bunch of retired players having fun along with decently good insight,4
brian lara imitating chris jordan‚Äôs run between the wickets will never not be funny,7
"Lund Parathas RCB need Starc back üò≠
When will we play another final :(",5
Calling this for DC,6
Munna bhai pollard will come in at 15-5 at 7th over and still win this,6
"Swanny at bottom of table with predictions.
Lara at the top. 

Swanny predicting DC win, Lara predicting MI win.",6
"Just found out at Cricbuzz that teams defending less than 160 in IPL finals have a 100% win record (4 out of 4). However, teams defending 160-200 have a 20% win record (1 out of 5).

Some 4D chess by DC.",71
"Calling it now, the Pandya brothers biopic is going to feature Ajay Devgan and Gulshan Grover, with BOTH somehow starring as Krunal",63
I prefer iyengars to iyers,-6
DC scored less than expected. But still defendable score.  Whatever happens MI please dont promote Pollard. Keep him at death.,9
"How will Nortje break into saffers lineup?? You have Pheluwakuyo, Rabada and Ngidi all three with incredible stats backing them",1
Rohit needs to guide this chase and get a 55 ball 80 take MI home,9
You have to make simple plans. Strategy for DC - get 7 quick wickets. Thats it!,3
Nortje 160 incoming,3
"Guys what are your thoughts on Select Dugout?

Should I give it a go?",3
Really gonna miss dugout ;(,2
"Inb4 MI score only 11 ,all get ethically run out by ashwin ,ponting dancing in dugout",19
"Cmon Sharmaji, we need a captain's knock today.",7
Haha Quinny is nervous,3
"I know ""memeing into form"" and ""jinxes"" are a meme here but do some people take that stuff actually seriously here?",8
Drop one catch off Rohit and he will show who the real boss is,2
Apparently Kishan can't bat until the 13th over.,3
QDK vs Ashwin üî•,6
Brohit is curvy af,4
"The four of MI Bowlers - Bumrah, Boult, NCN, Jayant all did well

Only the 5th Bowler (Krunal+Pollard) went for plenty - 43 runs",7
guys.....who wants one final super over,5
Just want a game changing non striker runout.,7
Come on Rohit!,2
Either MI chases this in 16 overs or 17 overs or 18 overs or 19 overs or 20 overs,1
Unpopular opinion - MI have won the IPL 4 times.,-5
Need a captains innings from Rohit.,1
DC to win from an Ashwin Mankad please,3
16 overs they will chase it.,1
"Fans: Lets jinx to decide the winner

Some other fans: Lets reverse jinx to decide the winner

**MI & DC players: hum kya kare phir, khelna chhod de? (T: should we leave the match?)**",2
Strong mankading vibes today!,3
Ashwin mankading Pollard would be amazing,1
Underwhelming finals.,0
Rabada is confirmed purple cap aye?,4
Forget that Stoinis can bowl unless needed.,-1
Thoughts on Zimbabwe's tour? I think theyre getting WAY better since they beat Lanka 3-2 in odis and drew a test with Windies and only lost to SA by 34 runs. All without Madhevere and Blessing. And then took a game off pak too and nearly beat us in the first one,1
Rohit has not lost a single final.,6
I feel horrible but I want DC to lose. I don't want RCB along with Memes XI to be the only existing teams with 0 titles.,9
"I know people here swear by the Dugout stream but it always seems a bit stale and soulless to me, especially last season was horrendous.",1
So today Nohit or Brohit?,3
Really wanna see something good from rohit today,2
What kind of chewing gums the players chew? Sugarfree?,5
We want BroHit today!,4
Cannot tell if more ppl in this thread are pro-Mumbai or pro-DC.,3
"It's obvious but the powerplay is so crucial to what happens here. If MI try to see off the openers then DC can go for the strangle, but if they go on the attack they provide more opportunities for wickets.",3
mankad incoming,2
McGlanaghan looks like Pablo Escobar from teh TV series.,2
Thicc v/s ethicc up front,7
"Ashwin can turn this around for MI. he usually gets the best bat from the opposition. So he is likely to get Sharma, Yadav and Pandya. that's game.",2
"Ashwin bowling first over, we are in trouble...",3
Is Ashwin to open the bowling??,3
"As expected, ethical mind bowling",3
thicchit sharma,2
Ash gets 5 wickets all Mankads,3
Pant Kabadiwala show incoming in few overs,1
I‚Äôm tired of Rohit‚Äôs batting form. Hope he delivers,2
Ashwin gonna go on a mankade fiesta,2
If only DC could take 3 wickets in power play,1
Can the real Brohit please stand up?,1
Who has wicket alert for this over?,1
"Shreyas Iyer & Rishabh Pant did not fail in a crucial match for their team.

They don't deserve to be in the national side!",5
Ashwin is going to be the game changer today mankading his way to a 5-fer. He will take a flight directly from the pitch after the match to avoid Ponting.,5
"If there ever was a time for mankad, i think this is it.",10
Brohit please hang in there for 20 balls,3
üÖ±Ô∏èrohit needed,3

Stop reverse jinxing y'all,3
"Y‚Äôall preparing for Sky, Kishan, Pollard and Hardik. Brohit came out of syllabus",2
Goti mu mey moment for Rohit and MI fans.,6
I have a feeling MI might play defensively and that would cause a thriller in the last overs with like 5-6 wickets in hand.,4
"Please maiden first up, would be amazing",1
Brohit angry mode on,2
Fuck me I had a heart attack during that,8
Rahane basically opened every innings due to early wickets and consistantly shit the bed,5

MI gonna win lol,3
there is no way QDK will score off Ashwin,4
8 scored. 149 more to do,7
I'm not scared about Rabada as much as I'm scared about ethical mind,5
[deleted],1
QDK ain't gonna repeat the same mistake against ethical mind.,4
Kohli would have put the shortest player of the team there,4
 Ashwin anna.. Turn it.. Mankad them.. Let Bumrah come out to bat tonight.,1
Punter would've spanked Shreyas and co if they got out to Mumbai like they did last couple of times. Hence the performance,7
Why not let Rabada bowl the first over with new ball?,2
I can't say this enough but Ashwin getting smacked have been some of the most beautiful sights this IPL.,0
Not a very ethical first over.,1
[deleted],3
7 bonus runs already ;),3
Seems CSK fans are more worried than DC fans here,1
Lmao Rohit. Seriously though ...... bit risky ....,2
One six by rohit.. And yall already declaring MI the winner lol,2
Rohit is gorging on Vada Pavs to assert dominance lmao,4
Why am I so nervous. Fuck.,4
"When Harsha said, *there's a man out there..*

Fuck me. Massive relief it went over.",3
6 in the first over lol. Only Mumbai has the balls to attempt that,5
I have a feeling that Rabada is gonna get SPANKED.,5
Nobody jinx brohit,1

GG Guys see yall next IPL,3
It's Us against the world. MI take my energy ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï‚Äø‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§,5
Even pre-lockdown Pant would have caught that,4
Rohit and De Kock can score 90 in 15 overs so that Pollard and co can finish it by scoring 68 in the last 5 overs,3
I like the INTENT MI. Keep that up before DC realize what's happening,2
"Imagine if someone fit was keeping for DC, lol that was a catch",1
Hahaha,1
Congrats MI good win :(,4
"Bumrah's best season & still short of the purple cap, that's something.",3
Pant!! Seriously needs to work on fitness. Can't keep this way in AUS,4
The term leg bye sure is a misnomer sometimes,6
Are the commentators going to STFU for atleast 5 seconds.,3
These 2 want to finish this chase in the PP,4
Lol I was scared too when Rohit hit that,1
"fuck rcb for letting go of qdk for cheap and even worse, giving him to mumbai for peanuts",5
Why does this not have the feel of a final ?,2
Is this a final or a dead rubber match ?,3
Goddamit pant would have caught that,1
"*Copypasta time :)*

That's it. That seals the deal.. My blood is boiling! This match is RIGGED! This Mumbai team will NEVER be my IPL 2020 winner. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sick of this, my girlfriend already got us tickets to Nigeria where my future wife and I will reside and watch their cricket matches until there is a LEGAL IPL tournament. I‚Äôm even leaving my illegitimate CSK son.

DC wins this match if you count the legal wickets",5
Delhi missing DK,2
Second game in a row where it looks like Rabada hasn't turned up against MI,1
Currently kissing goodbye to those 100 coins I bet,5
"MI, if you're gonna win, please atleast make it close. Don't just cruise through in a boring chase",3
MI wants to jack up that NRR,1
"Whatever happens, I'm so happy with this team. Our two main batsmen proved tthey are not chokers",6

The fact that KL will win Game Changer of the season is sad. He has been game changer for the opposition in some games. If not for his slow batting KXIP would have one at least 2 matches. He did do his best though but his SR was not upto the mark.,11
"Death, taxes and de kock jokes",1
"Just saw Kishan padded up, incase anyone was wondering, whether he is injured",4
easy easy EASY EASY **EASY EASY**,2
MI are going to win next year too because it's an odd year :( . CSK really should have fucking won last year,2

Mumbai winning this by 7-8 wickets easily,3
TFW you realise cant blame Iyer for shit captaincy when they cunt your best bowler for 18 runs,8
All 20 overs of slow balls pls,3
"Nobody:
Absolutely nobody:
Rishabh Pant: ezezezezezezezee",6
SRH might be fuming at least they might have took 2 wickets by now!,8
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm not questioning Rohith Sharma‚Äôs capabilities, I‚Äôm questioning YOUR intelligence‚Äù lmao",17
Rabada might be a great wicket taker but certainly not the best t20 bowler. Bumrah and Archer are clear of him right now.,7
What's the temperature  where you are living?....... in mumbai its 26,6
Someone please come and take 2 wickets next over,2
"Srh supporter here but lets just be honest, if were good we would have been in the final. MI is just too good for anyone this tournament.",8
Mighty DC,1
Rabada is bowling quick on a slow wicket like our boys banging into the pitch in the first WI test when you needed to be pitching it up,6
Ashwin is an underrated Whiteball bowler ..,2

De Kock is Rabada's captain so I think he must have told Rabada to bowl badly in this match if he wants to make the SA team in 2021.,-2

"Bumrah has been much better than Rabada all through the tournament. Wickets at all stages as opposed to Rabada's reliance on death over wickets. And much better economy. 

But Rabada takes the purple cap. Meh.",9

"Fuck

Looks like they will chase it down around 14-15 overs,3
How many player can mumbai retain ?,2

Fuck this is raw butt fucking with a barbed wired bat.,5
Okay Iyer innings was a disaster class. We have confirmation now!,-2
"I have been a CSK fan for the longest time. Naturally I dont want MI to win. But, if rohit winning one more and playing exceptionally here makes BCCI realise how dumb they are to not take him for limited overs to Australia, so be it. If it makes them change the captaincy from virat to rohit for limited overs, i will be team MI for today. Fuckin assholes",9
I feel there is a crash incoming to make things spicy :),4
MI looking to increase their NRR for next season lol,7

Is there any hope left for DC fans now?,9

Don‚Äôt understand logic behind Rohit not playing the LOIs but the tests when LOIs have been his strength,3
"Even if DC lose, would be nice if nortje bowls a 160 today",5
Does MI realise they are only chasing 157,9
Lmao MI are toying with DC,5
Defo kxip,2
Why was QdK so bad at RCB? You can‚Äôt even make the argument that he was given a new role in MI. Same fucking role. Keep and be aggressive as an opener.,7
Is my boi channelling his inner brohit,6
Is this Rohit's highest score this season?,2
Why short though?,3

Is there anywhere where i can find how much each team has spent on players over the last few years? Would be interesting to find out if MI splashed the cash or had better recruitment and facilitating the players reaching their potential,3

Well atleast I can sleep early today,3
"Someone said MI would be happy with 35-0 powerplay start. Well, it's past that now.",10
MI win with 10 wickets in hand ?,7
This game reminds me of the 2007 Wc T20 final. Pakistan had a blistering start like this in the 2nd innings but eventually ended up losing.,3
delhi look so dejected. Kohli atleast tries to fight until the last ball.,7
Someone tell rohit that they are chasing 157,7

"Last 4 finals, MI were defending a total

Today they are defending the title.

So I guess, to quote Pant, EASY EASY EASY",9
DC channelling their inner DD,9
You can see that Mumbai are used to this kind of occasion. All of their big players have stood up so far.,13
"Just imagine next year, if MI come back with Boult, Bumrah and Malinga.

With one of the best top orders (Rohit, QDK, IK, SKY), a league best middle order (Krunal, Hardik, Pollard), and league best bowling unit (Bumrah, Boult, Malinga, Chahar).

The ball is a vada pav for Rohit,3
"The issue with DC is that MI‚Äôs batting line up is just that good. They needed 180+ to have a decent chance to win the game and this shit bowling isn‚Äôt helping either. After the opening pair they have Kishan, Sky and HP to play without mentioning KP. Sad to say but this is game over already unless DC takes quick successive wickets without giving away 45 in 4 like they are doing.",3

So we gonna see bang bang wicket bang bang tonight?,1
Oh no our openers out!! ...so anyway..,2
To think this MI team lost to CSK in the opening game this year. It's hard to believe.,5
Bowl slow. Dc should have understood it 4 overs ago.,3
start the car,1
De Kock‚Äôs son Ben will be very disappointed,2
20 from 12 i guess ill take that,1
St-TrentBoult-toinis,1

Now can we stick to taking more wickets,1
"The Hulk does it again.

Though I can just picture the Aussie selectors ready to induct him back into the T20I team",3
The pitch is slow. Bowling into the wicket worked for Mumbai. Shouldn't bowl that to Rohit though. Should work on others.,2

Stoinis should just take the trophy and run if DC do lose. Who realistically can beat him up to take the cup back?,8
"Just logged in, Mumbai winning yet again?",3
QDK well played this season.,3
 Stoinis has a knack for picking up great wickets with ordinary balls.,5
Damn that Pant echo tho lol,10

"Out of 24 balls Bumrah bowled 8 Low Full Tosses at 145 Kph and went for only 7 R.P.O. Stupid Nortje can't even copy that, keep bowling those hard lengths at 150 Kph and getting smacked üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠",4

We can still win this match, but losing QDK early will hurt a bit.",2
Pant's voice is echoing lmao,1
Sky has looked a million bucks every game he walks in,18
SKY gonna SKY,4
MI brimming with *INTENT*,6
SKY to take us home!,6
How late of a stream are most of you guys on?,8
MI wanna finish in 10 overs.. They wanna party soon,7
QDK - top scorer for MI. Well played this season.,3
dude can anyone tell MI that they're chasing 150 not 200+,3
"Lol this is just bad 
De Kock goes and SKY comes and hits a 4",4
SKY daddy,2
Stoinis reaction after first and second ball can be made into a meme,6
"Incoming *Oh no, anyway* memes",7
"Still crease at Akash Chopra‚Äôs zinger from last game. 

‚ÄòUp above the world so high, thy name is Sky‚Äô.",1
Got out first ball and then took a wicket first ball. Cricket is a great leveller.,7
"Oh no, anyway",11
MI gives no shits,6
HAHHAHAHHAHA,2
Sky is beautiful,5
**Marcus Stoinis** only alpha player to get out on first ball and get a wicket on the first ball in IPL-FINAL,24
Not even Stoin can save us,4
How do we even beat this side?,22
Arey behenchod SKY Kohli isn't the captain today,12
"This batting just keeps coming at you lol. Only Kishan, Pollard and two Pandyas left.",16
Now Karna at it,1
"If DC somehow able to pull this game around, Imma come out my closet and tell everyone I'm GAY.",14
It's over for MI,2
This is going to be chased in 10 overs at this rate,3
Sky just crossed kohli on number of runs this season.,3
"Out? Oh no, anyway",5
Lmao. SKY just doesn't give a shit,12
They don't even care they lost a wicket,13
Surya wasting no time,11
Sexy SKYüòçüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
MI is chasing 250 or something?,3
Ahahahahaha,1
Nothing to say just no words proper bossing by mi,2
"Why do we even watch this fucking shit

Not even worth celebrating until its their 7th wicket down",3
Sky pure class,1
"Jfc SKY is doing bits already

Mumbai are elite",3
What is this? Lol unbelievable,2
Why does SKY look like he's chewing paan all the time,5
That was a rank ball,2
The happiness of taking a wicket being sucked out,5
why even celebrate that last wicket lmao,8
Purple patch yadav has joined talent sharma in the middle here.,3
SKY to Stoinis: So I heard you played under Koach last year,4
Wtf is wrong with MI?,4
And SKY fans go crazy,3
SKY looks set from dressing room,3
"They probably told MI that if you win the game within 15 overs, you get a platinum trophy.",7
Hahahahaha WTFF 50 ALREADY wtfffff,2
"Rohit's pads are so yuck, unlike everything else about his batting",0
Bruh WTF,3
Ponting gonna eat all his fingers.,2
Mumbai is on just another level,1
MI playing for NRR,3
SKY: OH no!  Anyways..,2
SKY is a legend,1
Omae wa mou Shinderu,2
Sun rises and with that DC's hope falls,5
MI looks so confident while chasing this target... This is the confidence we have not seen from any other team this IPL.,5
What the absolute fuck is happening,2
Stoinis taketh Stoinis giveth.,3
Bruh MI is looking to crush DC as well as their spirits,3
Oh No! Anyway,2
MI have a flight to catch in 1hr,4
Someone said to SKY that Virat is from Delhi. Rip,10
Bruh they're going to chase it in 13 overs,3
I think Rohit is the designated anchor and everyone else is going to take the bowlers on,5
wtf lol,2
This is some hitting from MI,2
Wtfff SKY stop I can only cum so much,0
"MI loses a wicket:

Oh no!

Anyway",14
"*De Kock gets out 

Mumbai : Anyway",15
Someone tell mi that their nrr would not be carried to next season ü§£,4
Surya ensuring Aussies get a few more hours of sleep tonight,0
Surya is showing how its done. This is how its done in T20. I cant believe he is not in instead of Manish or Iyer.,4
They should just let MI bat 20 overs! As a thank you to fans,0
SuryaKumar looks like the next Kohli ..,2
This is a joke right? Can someone tell me when the second innings actually starts?,3
Sky straight to business,2
Surya giving audition to true Indian captain Rohit üòã,9
**Motabhai Indians give zero fucks**,2
Bruh SKY chill we got overs mate there is no need to rush,7
Mumbai were just showing a bit of mercy there,2
SKY has gone past Koach  in this year's run tally!,8
One third target over in just 5th over,1
I‚Äôm done. See y‚Äôall next year. It was fun!,2
Manish over Sky perhaps in Indian T20 team perhaps might be greatest mystery of 2020.,6
Mumbai still attacking when the required run rate is 7 lmao,5
MIPL,8
Last time 3rd. This time 2nd. Do the math boys. 5 months left,9
will pay a million bucks just to watch SKY do that winning gesture he did against RCB,3
That is Stoinis for you!!,3
"On normal days you'd be thrilled to take De Kock's wicket. But on days like this when you see Mumbai batting lineup you think what is the point. Every non-Australian who watched cricket in 2000-2007 knows this feeling. Yes you got Gilchrist out, well done.",29
At this point it looks like MI will win the match and the trophy by the 15th over,7
"10 runs in 3 balls, fucking crazy.",4
Surya making the selectors look more like a bunch of jokers with every inning.,13
"All a wicket does is give me a hint of hope....

And then the next MI batsman walks it and it dissipates. Damn they're stacked.",10
"LOL Suryas like oh fuck last ball was a dot ball

lemme get a quick 10

what a hero",9
"SKY isn‚Äôt even trying, what the actual fuck.",7
"Bro, regardless of everything..idc how much SKY makes..

How is he not in the Indian team..",22
MI still playing for NRR or what,8
"SKY wants to remind the selectors everyday what mistake they did by not even considering him when he is at his peak form.

You go boy. Keep going.",12
Suryakumar > Virat,-8
How the fuck is SKY so good.,5
SKY should have been on that plane to Australia.. still can if Kohli and selectors can get their head out of their asses and see the guy in form of his life..,7
[removed],9
IPL is Bundesliga and MI are Bayern Munich,13
Do MI fans actually want their team to win another title? Won't it get boring,9
This game doesn't give me the finals vibe at all,14
"QDK goes out early

MI: Oh no!!! So, anyway....",14
"Dot ball? Now we know why he has not been selected.

/s",14
Suryakumar no international yadav,1
No BS run outs pls,3
"Remember when I said DC need at least 220 to be competitive and yall were disagreeing?

How about now?",7
This will be over by the 15th,2
Can someone tell me the SKY-Virat beef?,2
SKY was sitting in the dugout watching the stare down with Koach for motivation,29
Has someone told Mumbai that they don't need to work on their Net Run Rate in this game!?,19
We couldn't bat for shit in our turn but they're doing it so easily,12
This will be done and dusted In 15-16 overs,9
Vada Pav kon Bola re...BC,7
Who told them that they're chasing 200,21
Honestly this is just embarrassing for DC now,13
MI aren‚Äôt even trying. Iyer c‚Äômon do SOMETHING,10
Rabada is a gun fielder,8
It‚Äôs hilarious if MI end up 156 all out in 14 overs,0
Rohit is so classy.,11
SKY is way better than Kolhi in T20 check stat,4
Sharma looks in form....,10
DC change your kit color fk me,9
"I still can't believe India didn't pick SKY on their roster for Australia series.

Dude is an absolute stud.",12
"DeKock and premature ejection

Name a better duo",8
Rabada what a gun fielder,7
Not as if that is gonna make much of a difference but love the commitment from KG,9
Give me one reason why SKY is not in the Indian team yet. This guy is way too good to not be selected. He seems to have rubbed egoistic koach and the selection team the wrong way.,13
Only way delhi can win this is make mi all out,11
He is in that Midas touch phase is SKY. No way right now Iyer or Manish is batting better than him,12
Rohit may just retire and prepare for Aus tour,5
100 of 90. Easy af,2
Ggwp MI.,3
"MI lose a wicket

MI: Oh no,Anyway",14
How can some one play so effortlessly in a final. DC have shat themselves 4 times against MI this season,9
Srsly it is a shame SKY is not picked for national team.,12
Are we past the Brohit nohit line yet?,5
top fielding,3
Have to bowl Rabada next over!,3
Even if they do Tuk Tuk they will crawl towards victory,3
Rohit in form looks so good. Elegant af,5
Great effort Rabada‚ú®üëè,6
Ambani must be throwing some next level party. MI want to finish this in 15 overs,6
Did DC miss a trick by giving pace to the MI batters? The dugout was on and on about the slow wicket and we did see the hard back of length balls sit up and get caught in the first innings.,4
"Fans to MI:Stop,he's dead already!!!",8
"These two don't even care about DC, they're playing to make the selectors look like donkeys.",7
MI would've ideally liked a lefty along with Rohit. Hope Ishan is okay or it doesn't come to a point where we need him.,5
This reels ad is FUCKING CRINGY,9
Selectors are hiding as Rohit & SKY batting together. Will make them look stupid once again.,10
"Pls disband this MI team man, too OP",6
Who knew when I said in first innings that MI would chase whatever DC made in 16 overs I could be wrong because I overestimated DC,5
Brohit is now timing beautifully. Thank you DC for getting him back in form. I think he will bat number 4 in tests once kohli leaves.,5
MI make full use of the powerplay.,2
Axar Patel hattrick loading,3
Mumbai Indians are like Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team of IPL,5
Atleast make this charity match interesting MI,7
"Surya basically saying to selectors: Thukra ke mera spot, Mera inteqam dekhoge.",6
If DC lose this match they have to change their kit colors.,7
[deleted],6
Rohit bats so beautifully,5
"SKY is already 30

that fucking sucks

was he always this good and was i just blind?",19
MI have hit as many sixes as DC did in their entire innings,5
"MI loses wicket:Fuck!


Anyways....


üòÇ",10
Indians Australian summer bout to be gloomy without SKY,6
"Get a wicket off the first ball, proceed to concede 13 off the next 5 balls. 10 off the 2 after the wicket.",3
"I think I understand the meaning of OP now.

MI is OP
OP-MI",3
This is not fun anymore ‚òπÔ∏è. Congrats MI,3
Please please make it worthy final to watch DC ... this looks like one way domination :(,6
Let's believe in Axar,2
100 off 90 is a cakewalk.,4
"Why do teams always face their bunnies recently in the finals. 

2018 : SRH lost 4 to CSK

2019 : CSK lost 4 to MI

2020 : DC on its way to lose 4 against MI !!!",7
It should be illegal to have team THIS good,2
This MI side just can't be beat,2
DC have 3 spinners but SKY is a brilliant player of spin. This will be a good battle.,3
BC ye bulldozer kaun ghar laata hai?,1
Feel like 2003 word cup final. MI batting line up is so good.,6
If we win within 15 overs the first match next season is awarded as a win to us,5
Can't believe the powerplay still isn't over,3
Sky should not have shown attitude to koach,-13
MI have already hit (4) as many sixes as DC hit the whole game.,7
"Welp, gg it's been a good run",1
"To those whining about MI being too OP, most of these guys were available to other teams at auction too.

They just didn't get them.",11
what has samson done over surya to deserve a callup. serious question.,3
Need couple of quick wickets to at least make it to over number 17-18,1
MI is like the NSW of IPL,3
Is there a chance of Rohit being included in the LOI squad for Australia ?,3
"After such an exciting IPL with twists and turns, the underdogs SRH coming out of the grave, RCB actually playing well, CSK struggling, Super Overs galore, KKR‚Äôs shithousery, Punjab‚Äôs heartwinning comeback, Rajastan‚Äôs entertaining matches and Delhi‚Äôs fight to the final, I cannot believe it‚Äôs just going to end in an easy victory for Mumbai",27
Why MI are playing for NRR ?,2
"Who do you think has the most powerful orgasm, Shane Warne when Stoinis does well or Sunny G/Manjrekar when Mumbai does well?",9
"Ponting finally getting the taste of his own bitter medicine. 




He has finally met an outright dominant team.",10
"Guys off topic but if you haven't heard petta rap, it's a ridiculously good rap from the Tamil industry by Rehman from the 90s. Absolutely ridiculous how far ahead of it's time it sounds.",3
IPL is for the mi fans,8
"I play like MI when i queue for casual lobby in csgo 

And become dc the moment i queue up for competitive :/",9
Apparently holding back your best bowler doesn't work when you have a low score,3
Brohit miffed that such a good shot didn't go for 4.,4
A 100 inside 10 overs without the loss of a wicket is what I  wish for,3
Is this the  worst IPL final already?,11
"Some terms

Tewatia- miracle
MI - OP",9
Honestly it's not only happening because the opposition is DC this would have been same for every other team.,9
This Mumbai team doesn't even have any fucking villains either. I can't even hate them in good conscience.,12
Bruh Sunny G. Curb your Mumbai bias,3
"hot take but i love dominating finals, there‚Äôs just something powerful about the best team performing their best when it matters the most",9
Who's MI's best batsman this season?  it's a no brainer - SKYüî•,4

Patel chaining MI.,2
DC Fans:Look how they massacred my boy!!!,7
Imaging losing to the same team 4 times in one season!,7
We sacrificed for this?,6
Lol Sunny Rohit has not been International Rohit in IPL in past few seasons.,4
This mi team is like australia in the 2000s,12
Paan khau ko koi to out kro,2
"Why is it that mumbais gambles always work out? Pushing SKY up the order in his first year, QDK even after a few par seasons, JAYANT YADAV IN THE FINAL FFS AND COULTER NILE HAVING BETTER FIGURES THAN BUMRAH?",21
"Why the hell did Delhi choose to bat, idiotic move.",3
"I think we do need a mega Auction to reset the teams...

Though most teams are best balanced in this IPL, Mumbai a class apart.",10
It feels like every spinner has a good record against Rohit,2
"SKY is definitely a better T20 batsman than Pandey, Iyer etc",10
"So guies, what are your future plans after the IPL?",11
(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª),5
We were too naive to expect anything but this tbh,8
Funny how sharma not mentioned in best mi batsman for season... True but funny,12
"Ever since that incident , everywhere sky goes he sees koach",7
Bring back stoinis,5
"As soon as there are 3 dots, Rohit immediately said it's okay, not that Sky doesn't know, but still it feels good for a batsman",9
"Does any oldies remember how this sub used to hate on MI like a bitch? It was toxic af. But love how good we are now, no margin for hate at all lmao.",14

Who would win?",2
Admit it boring ass final because of this mismatch,13
Mi playing slow,6
Fuck I just remembered that I have a pending credit card bill and the last powerplay of the season ended,15
This MI team is too overpowered,5
The match is already dead. Finish inside 14.3 please for the memes,13
"Some MI match game threads should have an NSFW tag

This has just been hardcore nuts to butts powerplay",9
Why didn't Ishaan got even a single chance but Rishab got sp many for the country ...even after being u19 captain ?,8
"DC fast bowling has been frustratingly ordinary. Imagine SRH bowlers defending this low total, it just has to look different.",12
Look an over that goes under 8 runs an over!!,7
"We definitely need mega auction before the next ipl, this MI team is too op",9
Sunny bhai losing no nut november while on air,11
There's got to be a climax here,5
Ishan can bat before 13th over,6
"This MI reminds me of 1999-2007 Australia. You have to put in everything to beat them, Bat well, bowl well, field well and then you might win 1-2 out of 10 matches. The rest, you will lose anyway.",13
[deleted],10
MI's going like 10 an over so let's first focus on slowing down their RR,5
Mumbai Australians,4
Leg spinner has to bowl now!,4
Sunny G simops to hard for Rohit.,5
MI - Mumbai Invincibles!,7
If MI wins this easily will they even celebrate and run on to the field like they have in their previous finals wins?,8
"SRH would‚Äôve actually put up a fight here, they should‚Äôve got through.",7
"Only the spinners and stoinis can turn around for DC, otherwise no hope whatsoever",4
MI should be DQd for being too good.,3
It will be Dubey's night,1
Curious. Is sky good at FC level?,2
Atleast I wont get to see the shitty WhiteHat ads after today,4
"At least Rohit is kinda back in form, for the Australian tour",10
Imagine MI 3 peat next year. They would go down as one of the best cricketing teams ever.,7
"all those people who are not ""entertained"" by this final can kindly fuck off so we can enjoy it",15
This will be our 4th loss to MI this season,4
MI with the highest powerplay score in IPL finals yet again,7
Reminder that you can always trust South Africans in a crunch game.,8
"If Natarajan has been added to India's squad, is it too late to remove Pandey and include Suryakumar?",4
What that kid Praveen is doing there,2
If MI playt like this they'll lose 3 off an over is bad.,2
wtf with the loud music.,4
MI winning will be like watching Mercedes 1-2 finish,11
"I so badly wanted DC to win but tbh I‚Äôm not even mad that MI will win cos they‚Äôve played so consistently, pains me to say it but they deserve it",10
SKY is the most important player for MI right now. He is a brilliant player of spin.,9
[deleted],5
Spin is on. Time to enjoy Pant's squeals,10
"For all the years I've followed the game of cricket, the ability to come back is what is central to a strong team.

In the 90s, early 2000s there were so many times when other teams would play well, pick up a couple of wickets only fro Australia to slowly come back into the team. Even SA would be the same. 

Sad moments for me as a child. I see that similar trait in MI. A lot of times they just sieze those moments like getting that Pant wicket.",4
No one is close to put pressure on MI,6
"If we can get ishan Kishan in the next auction, he'll be a great addition to our side",3
"I really hope that the next ipl has a mega auction and few of these MI players get displaced,cos this Mi team is way to op",7
"This reminds me of the peak Australian team, doesn't give a fuck stomping opponents to the ground.",5
I have no idea why these 2 are not in the T20I squad to face Australia.,4

Look at Dhawan, Kohli, Sharma.. they all evolved while playing international cricket.

Ita about recognising talent early and letting them evolve in the international circuit..

And that sucks balls for SKY and the entire system is to be held accountable for it because we have spots in our team..its not like the Indian team is packed....in the WC 19 we needed a batsman..and SKY fits that role perfectly..",28
MI playing sensibly against spinners.,5
Such a boring final,4
Why are they showing the DLS par score?,1
"If MI reach 85-1 after 10, match finished",6

We lost the match in that Rabada over.",4

[deleted],13
Omg i can't. A fucking final can't be THIS one-sided,11
Is it just me or has every run in the last 3 overs come off the same shot in the same place?!,4
Script writers gave up after that 2 super overs match.,13
I kind of Understand why RR beat Mumbai. 3 out of 4 of their Top batsmen are some of the best players of Pace and they go hard against MI's biggest strength,13
Mumbai Indians vs England at MCG. Who wins?,15
I think spinners will hold a key for DC tonight,2
MI should do a spin-a-rooni like 5 time champ Booker T after collecting the trophy.,7
Why is Ash out?,8
"I think some players are too unlucky not to represent national teams regularly

1. Sky, 
2. Wasim Jaffer
3. Stuart McGill
4. Axar Patel
5. Kyle Abbott",7
Pant Lol,4
Jor jor se bolke sabko scheme bata de Pant,10
"BCCI should remove MI in the even years. At least competition would be open. Cannot see MI winning every year. This MI team is impossible to beat. They can even beat the teams, without Rohit. Every player for them is a match-winner.",8
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
Rabada-Nokia's loss of form in the last part of the tournament has also led to DC's downfall,7
"What a waste! Sky is in sublime form,he‚Äôs timing everything and it‚Äôs coming off beautifully",3
"DOT THEM UP

DOT THEM UP",10
Calling it. Rohit will play a stupid shot here and get out.,2
Spin choke‚Ñ¢,0
why the fuck are they respecting Axar Patel so much,1
MI batting has been so good Bumrah never batted. I don't think Chahar also.,7
"Axar too economical

9 runs in last 3 overs",6
3 good overs in a row here. A wicket now makes it interesting,3
"We need a mega auction god damn it, these fuckers will win the next one too.",13
MI should distribute their players to remaining 7 teams and declare that MI will never play again.,5
MI now slowing down. but they can canter home from here.,2
"Quiet last few overs, a wicket here would be great for DC",3
RRR rising,2
The real winner of the IPL is The Altroz Super Car.,7
R MI tryna make it interesting or what?,2
MI are slowing down here,1
Why DC stressing my boi SKY like this. Bring on Stoinis to make him happy,4
MI will take it deep‚Ñ¢,4
9 runs in last 18 balls...hmm..,3
What a lame final- the beginning of the IPL was the best,20
Yar first 3 overs spoiler it all. Vahi sab cover karlia unhone. MI is really smart.,1
Bruh Jayant Yadav has a Test average of 45 and 11 wickets from 7 innings including a hundred. Who the fuck is this guy?,6
Every year its always either MI or CSK winning the trophy.,7
Mumbai needs to be more aggressive vs spin imo,5
MI toying with DC at this point...making them believe they can turn this around lol,8
"No Sunny, SKY is not getting restless. He‚Äôs doing his job. STFU",7
Oh Brett lee making fun of Rohit‚Äôs ‚Äúfitness‚Äù!!!!,5
"Its too early to say this but

Since next ipl is within 6 months and presumably there is no mega auction

MI might be first team to win 3 consecutive times if they continue the form",8
"Playing out Axar like is he Rashid, smart",3
Too much respekt‚Ñ¢,3
Why do people think Kohli has 100% say in team selection?,7
Everyone in the comments already declaring MI the winner and MI making 2-3 runs an over there...,2
MI playing spinners like they all are Rashid Khan.,3
Pravin DUBAI,4
"Its gonna be like first innings. 

Powerplay - mumbai ahead

Mid overs - dc comeback

Death - easy for mi",4
Maybe the real Rohit fans were the vada pavs along the way,6
Spinners are bowling difficult lengths.,3
"Jo baat kari thi, chalne de waise hi",6
Dubey actually looks very good. Could be a perfect replacement for Mishraji,2
If Axar was with RCB/CSK/MI people will be calling him the MVP already.,3
Pant should be more vocal now. There‚Äôs pressure building,2
Pace on the ball is easier to hit than spin on this pitch,2
"Half of the balls Suryakumar played, they were helicopter shots. Dayumn maaannnn",3
Ganguly Playing with Mask,2
JO BAAT KARI THI USKO CHALNE DE,5
Masks are off. Not even 1m apart. Nice once Dada,2
"Pant tries too much with his ""Theek Hai"" after every fucking ball.",3
"Awkward Harold, Ganguly, Pug",3
Really need a wicket here.,4
This some real GOT type ending from the script writers especially after hyping us up with that double super over weekend,5
Dube is getting the ball to bounce. Why didn't he play earlier.,3
just like that...,2
Big shot is coming. Or a wicket,3
DC need Vayu Raghavan,2
Many wth is Greame Swann's problem. Is someone forcing him to make a dumb joke everytime someone else speaks? He just speaks all over everyone too,0
"Gonna miss dugout. 

Covid or not. Hope they keep this concept for future editions as well.",3
That 6 has broken the shackles,6
Script writers acting surprised lol,3
Don't you think casual fans would lose interest if we have soo powerful teams in the tournament.,6
Rohit letting loose,4
"Saw Mohanlal in the stadium just  before start of the match

Is he still there?",6
"Dubey has been entrusted with the task of taking the wickets while axar constricts the flow of runs. Pointing showed great faith in him,must‚Äôve really given him a lot of confidence",5
"If sky scores 23 more and Ishan scores 17 , it will be first instance where 3 batsman from the same team scored 500+ runs in a single season.",8
"When the worst performing player in your Team is Rohit Sharma, your Team is Illegal",12
Good job by Dubey and Axar of delaying the inevitable while Ashwin seems eager for going home early.,3
Gavaskar to die from the massive orgy he'll get after this win,6
"Dont start shitting on Dubey now, he had kept it extremely tight till that ball",8
Jay shah is one of the ugliest looking people alive,8
Our only hope is if Ganguly discovers the Power of Friendship right now and declares everyone a winner.,26
Six followed by forward defence,11
Rohit heard ya'll talkin shit,8
"Dubey please do a Mendis 2008, thank you",4
"Ah crap, all pressure released",10
Who all are sitting with Ganguly over there?,6
Now that Rohit has crossed 30 we can see a hitman version of him,12
What a day for Rohit to turn up,10
Is there any option for the teams to walk over? It will save DC the embarrassment against MI.,6
Brohit brohit brohit,2
Fuck Rohit Sharma,5
Roar macha üòî,7
ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,2
"Where are those people that said ""Every 4 year there is a new IPL champion"" ""It's an even year so MI won't win""          ""It's 2020 so DC or RCB might win""... Why did y'all give us a false sense of hope man??",19
Why has Rohit not been kept for our ODI Series against Aussies? He's looking amazing and is our best batsman against Australia. Really strange decision.,8
Can rohit score a century??,2
"Rishabh ""jo baat kari hai chalne de waise"" Pant",2
Rohit you beautyy üôè,2
Stop they're already dead,6
Brohit arriv,1
My Smile Is wider than your mom's ass rn,2
VADA PAV KING MOTHER FUCKERS,9
"Rohit: Ha be, kon bol raha tha vada pav?",13
Mumbai is like we want to play all the overs for once you useless team.,8
"Scriptwriters need new inspiration.

CSK vs SRH 2018 = 4/0
MI vs CSK 2019 = 4/0
MI vs DC 2020 = 4/0

At least RPS vs MI 2017 was 3/1.",7
Ponting: MI sCaReD tO fACe uS,8

Test Rohit amd T20 rohit playing one ball each lmao,12

Brohit needs to be in limited overs vs Aus,4
Vada pav man on fire,4
Smart innings so far from Brohit,1
"MI please. I beg you, please be gentle.",6
It's Brohit time.,6
Khatam. Ghar jao sab.,3
"Stop fat shaming Rohit, you fucking cunts.",16
hitman on it today. I had predicted it earlier that he will score big today.,3
Wc Rohit brohit is here today,3
Feel bad for pravin. Not his fault,6
Rohit will not play LOIs in Aus while Kohli will miss out the tests,5
DUBEhenchod,2
Rohit Sharma sixes make me so fucking happy,2
Dubey turning into Dube,6

Vada pav op,1
Where the hell is Sandeep Lamichanne!?!,1
At the moment it is looking like men Vs boys,1
"Rohit is revenge smashing Delhi now. Go bash the selectors, what have we done to you",6
Brohit bro have some mercy on these kids. They came here thinking you were injured.,8
Didn't Rohit get the memo that he struggles against legspinners,9
"Wait, you're telling me this guy who is the VICE captain of the Indian side is not selected for Australia because he is UNFIT? What are BCCI smoking?",6
All this dominance and its *just now* that the captain and the best batsman on paper in the team comes into party. One of the best t20 teams assembled.,8
Selectors in shambles lmao. Let's go.,1
I'm  a Simp for Rohit Sharma,3
"No one:

Pant: Baat kariu thi chalne de",2
"**Most seasons with 300+ runs**

Suresh Raina - 12

Rohit Sharma - 12",6
Brohit has arrived bois,2
"C'mon IPL scripties, your job's not done till the season ends.",6
Hitman living up to his name!!,3
Why does it look like they want 100 in Last 10 overs.,1
Rohit let's gooo,2
Since Rohit Sharma is unfit to play ODIS and T20s in Australia that means he should be unfit now also and all his runs should be removed. That's DC's only chance,4
So many teams died for this. If only srh fielded properly last time,2
"Bro I never expected all of Pant, Iyer, Boult and Rohit to play well in a final match",5
"The Nohit/Brohit line has officially been crossed.

Press F for DC.",9
"Ok, I think not giving new ball to Nortje/Rabada is plain stupid on this pitch not sure if it is pontings idea / Shreyas idea, pretty bad one...",5
IPL- a fun two months where everyone else fight and try to get into play offs to lose to MI,27
"This is basically the 2018 final. One team defeated the other 4 times to win, the opener who wasn't playing well exploded and made it an easy chase.",8
They changed the script writer mid IPL,6
Dube > Dubey,3
The real IPL was the fact we finally made the finals,12
[deleted],-3
"Anukul Roy 
Right handed fielder",3
Rohit Sharma the Real Madrid-La Liga Indian Ambassador,5
DC needs to find Spinners like bishnoi.,4
Big players always step up in pressure situations. Hats off Rohit.,9
Rohit shows his value in a crunch situation on the finals with a tricky target on a sticky pitch,3
Rohit probably wants to get the highest score by a captain in an IPL final. Currently held by Warner I think (69),3
The Nohit Brohit line is crossed.,5
Facebook is trying to build its image as a messiah for local businesses thru these ads while the reality is that it's one of the most unethical organisations,9
A rather unfit Rohit is still better than most openers India has,12
DC should declare now.,6
Ffs... MI fans. How easy your life is,4
Axar would be a great Dracula character,5
"DC get a wicket ffs. Bring in Rabada or Nokia. 

Make this an eventful final",2
MI is like AUS from the 90s. CSK is like WI from the 70s.,9
Australians gonna be the big winners of these 2 not being in the T20I squad.,7
"Can't wait for Twitter fan-wars to erupt after this with Brohit Fans saying ""Rohit performed when it actually mattered"" to taunt Koach's fans üòÅ",15
"Seems like Mumbai would like this to be over in quick fashion, so let me say this before the tourney is over. Happy Divali (early, of course) to everyone in this community, to those who observe and those who do not. May the light continue to ever shine in your lives, homes, families, community and everywhere you go. May the day bring happiness, togetherness, the joy of each others' presence and just all around family fun. Happy Divali guys and gals. Cheers!",28
So. That's the final nail in the coffin then. Well played DC. I am super proud of you guys.,8
Vada Pav looks in form...,8
Brohit mode on,5
"Comon, Rohit can easily play T20 in Australia.",8

"Remember when MI did not qualify for playoffs and Preity was heard saying she was happy that at least MI did not qualify after Punjab was kicked out, lmao",11
Oh my look look how scared is Mi to face dc today,8
Very poor writing.,4
Rohit one ball : smashes it. the other forward defense. Needs to practice for the upcoming Tests as well I guess.,14
Rohit looks in shape now. Good for Australia series,8
Brohit my guy,1
MI playing to chase the 190.,2
Are they saving ash for death?? Pandya and pollard will eat him up.,1
"Rohit confused Iyer in mutual funds and is rolling over him here.

Well Thicc Pant turned up today so it was expected that Thicc Rohit would also do the same.,8
Someone tell MI they are not going to carry over the NRR into next season.,9
Love a good Brohit beating.,3
Brohit came to play today.,5
We're so fucked without Rohit in the ODIs and T20Is in the Australian tour. Opening pressure is all gonna be on Dhawan.,5
"Rohit chose this match. But oh well there was always Kishan, Hardik, Pollard, Krunal and Sky to get you if he got out",5
Damn..Rohit has no chill,5
[deleted],8
Pant & Rohit what a time to get some runs,3
"Rohit is a treat to watch.

*A treat of vada pavs*",8
"With every six hit by Rohit he doesn't realise Ponting gonna blast him in comm box in upcoming Aus tour. "" Gee that's no foot movement from Sharma there"", "" Again just like Adelaide first innings poking at outswingers, Isn't he?"" "" Gee he's only good for subcontinent Rohit isn't he?""",27
"Every MI game, I waited for prime rohit.
He finally delivers.",9
"Hey, atleast it's fun to watch Rohit play well. Imagine if krunal was smacking it right now. It could always be worse",12
Praveen Dube was not a good selection,2
Our least successful batsman turns up in the final. Total and complete team dominance,7
Fucking koach and Rohit never shows up for India in knockout matches!,6
Vadda Six From Rohit,7
Doesn't the dugout sit a bit too close to the boundary rope? A fielder going over the line may collide with them,1
Very one-sided final,8

Well done Iyer!! I am so proud of you lad.",12
"FUCK KOACH, BCCI, SELECTION TEAM FOR NOT GETTING SKY!üò§üò§",13
I gotta be honest. I thought Rohit was rushing to get back after the injury but he looks in sublime touch.,18
Just bring stoinis or rabada,8
What an anticlimactic finish to an IPL filled with super over matches.,16
Yessss rohit sharma our captain ‚ô•,5
Man I feel this is probably the most dominant campaign led by a side in IPL (2 of 5 games were lost in Super Over and 1 other without some best players),13

fuck Iyer scored 519 runs. I thought he's been shit this season,8
I'm gonna miss dugout commentary after ipl.,4
DC wins if you count the legal sixes/fours of MI!,9

Its ok DC loss here. But if I dont see a smiling Iyer in the end I'll cry,3

CSK died early this year only for MI to win again.,5
IPL- where Hyderabad reaches play offs and loses miserably to the team who fails miserably in the finals,4
Only way this is gonna be interesting now is if SKY keeps playing anchor and Brohit smashes a century,6
Imagine being a Mi fan^_________^,5
btw is rahane our test captain for 3 games? we are fucked,4

DC didn't bowl too good last match. Our batsman were lazy and unlucky at times. They really needed to step up for a power-packed side like MI but failed to do so far.,2
"We shat the bed against the openers as usual. When we lose, we really lose badly. No 2 ways about it

Still a good IPL from us.",4

 RESPECT FOR SKY,12

9 in the next 18 balls

Selfless thing to do there,9

Safe to say everyone felt for rohit and SKY earned respect from everyone,7
I hope there is a collapse here and makes things atleast interesting for the purpose of script /s,5

"Rohit is just trying to make this match interesting. 

Just get pollard and pandya brothers runout and then get out. It will be interesting.",10
SKY didn't run because Ashwin was around,7
SKY did the right thing. Selfless. But! His form was better through the tournament. Should Rohit have returned and lost his own wicket?,6
If they could include Samson for ODIs I see no reason why they couldn't include SKY for T20s at the least.,8
MI so OP they have to nerf themselves,14
Sky sacrificing his wicket for the wrong captain lmao,7

I wouldn't mind DC winning tbvh...we will in 2021 anyway.,3
Good damn. Sky is good ld dude,4
Now I want MI to win for SKY :(,8
Isn't there something whenever Rohit runs out someone he goes on to score 200 or something?üòÖ,9

Even SRH would not have stood a chance. Not with Rohit in this form and mood.,14
Most boring ipl final in history,14
[removed],7
Can't they make field position graphic in contrasting colours. Can't see shit,3
Loi means?,2
Why does Ash like throwing darts?,4
"Ashwin : *bowls an unplayable beauty*

Dugout : Why doesn‚Äôt he bowl it every ball",19
At least we killed the even year nonsense. You are welcome MI,15
Thank you RCB fans for posting those Rohit knockout stats from a few days ago.,6
I still believe Rohit wicket can make this interesting,2
What more do BCCI need to watch about Rohit's fitness?  If he is going to open in tests in Australia he needs to play limited overs leg too.,8
"The way Rohit and QDK attacked Rabada though, pure dominance.",6
"Everybody going through the motions....DC need to do something different, put a slip in or something...",6
"At this rate, MI will also win IPL 2021",9
Bowled his stupid variations and got milked. Last delivery bowled a normal office and got it to rip. A reminder to everyone why Ashwin is shite these days in LOIs and gold in Tests.,8
"We were never going to win against MI. We just ensured they will the title by making it to the final.

Wait this is exactly like Sri Lanka vs India in 2011.",16
MI have been the best performers in the PP. Whether they are batting or bowling.,15
"Cant do anything Harsha, cant do anything",3
The longer this goes on - the more I'm baffled by how he's not been selected to play in Australia,10
Make a Best of the World XI. Even they would struggle against this MI side.,14
Give captaincy to Dhawan next year.,1
Any chance Ishan Kishan can get in on the national team ?,4
The best thing about Rohit running out his partners is that he compensates by scoring their runs too.,17
DC have missed the services of Mishraji and his hairpiece. It was their lucky charm.,6
"Taking extra responsibility when teammate's run out ‚úÖ

Today's Rohit sharma show",9
Rohit should have tried to reverse sacrifice and run back faster . Would have been hilarious,7
Who are they saving Rabada and Nortje for?,5
Dear Ganguly and selectors does he look injured rn ?,6
Boult to finally win something,3
Ambani is having the year of his life in 2020üòÇüòÇüëçüèΩ,5
Looking forward to international cricket now.,9
Everyone thinking MI is OP so they are winning... I think 2020 is wierd for an even year and that's why MI is winning...,6
"I know this match is over, but why not bring in one over of Nortje or Rabada?",5
"objectively good team performs objectively good
r/cricket : ‚ÄúWho else is sick of Mumbai winning ughhhhh‚Äù",11
"An in form Rohit is the most feared limited over batsman in the world.

Dude has 3 double hundreds in ODI for a reason.

He's like Vivian Richards and Virender Sehwag combined.",19
Now this is just a slow and painful defeat :(,4
"42 needed off 39

Pollard, Hardik, Krunal, NCN, Boult yet to come. 

Let's just call it off so that we all can go to  sleep early",11
Archer>>Bumrah>>Rabada this season imo,5
[deleted],21
Not bad by Ashwin,1
DC fans: STOP THE (run) COUNT,14
"The only time I wanted MI to be highly dominating, they lost by 10 wickets to SRH. \*\*PAIN\*\*",39
Two Indian batsman on the crease and iyer is bowling spinner. Just Iyer things.,5
Why can't the scriptwriters give more twists and turns? /s,10
"Atleast Rabada got the purple cap, Take that MI",9
[deleted],16
Brohit got Sky out so he can score his century. Sky was getting runs too quickly,11
"Once again Iyer... what are these bowling choices?
Bowl wicket takes man.",9
Ishan playing some weird ass shots,2
"5 overs of Nortje Rabada left with the match already gone.

This is my captain!",16
Theory: BCC didn't include Rohit in the Australia series to draw all eyes on Rohit. Rohit used this attention and leads his team to another IPL victory to take away captaincyship from Kohli.,13
[deleted],-1
"MI batsman still yet to bat - Pandya brothers, Pollard",6
[deleted],6
"Rohit hit about as much at Iyer at a good SR, so why is he 20 something points below Iyer?",11
I was told this is the most unpredictable IPL ever,14
Ishan Kishan getting snubbed is more disappointing than SKY getting snubbed for me. Kishan have been playing well for India A from 2018 but Samson is preferred over him in India squad everytime.,8
"Purple cap holder gets hit for a six

r/cricket : Ahh new recruit of Dinda Academy

A batsman on debut hits a 4

r/cricket : Why isnt he playing for India?",72
This feels like a downing of tools from DC,1
Axar has been BRILLIANT today,4
Imagine this side but with Malinga instead of NCN,11
[deleted],3
IPL- where Pant is expected to kill it but he only maims a little in the final.,6
Call Pandya & Pollard to finish this match in 3 overs.,5
"**IPL2020**

vs KKR

SK Yadav got run out

Rohit at Non Striker end

Rohit Scored 80

vs KXIP

SK Yadav got run out

Rohit at Non Striker end

Rohit Scored 70

vs DC*

SK Yadav got run out

Rohit at Striker end

Rohit batting on 60+",34
As a DC fan all I can say is I'm happy my team made it to finals,16
Pant is so fucking irritating man ffs shut your damn mouth.,4
"DC & RCB peaked too early in the season and then shit the bed towards the end. 

Stoinis opening against SRH was an exception.",23
Just a reminder that srh died for this,17
NGL without the crowd this doesn‚Äôt feel like a final at all. Atmosphere was something else during last year‚Äôs final.,6
"Rabada won the purple cap, but imo Jofra, Bumrah and Boult have all been better than him.",14
"IK rotating strike to Rohit so he can try to get a Century.

What a bro.",8
Axar had a good IPL.,7
"I believe, DC should stick to stop the runs and not take the wickets.",2
Lmao i have been saying this all along. Rabada is overrated. He cannot take wickets at the start and takes wickets only when the batting teams have a do or die attitude. You need someone to take wickets up top. Neither nokia or rabada can do that regularly.,-2
Axar has bowled better than Ash. What world is this,11
"If Trump was DC coach, we won by a lot because we're ahead in the runs.",45
This is one boring final considering the IPL finals of recent times,14
Rabada always tires at the end of the long season tbh. He had good figures last game vs SRH but two of those balls to get wickets were in the slot as well. KG said so as well.,11
MI have really respected Axar today.,8
They need Varun and Narine here,2
Our last time-out. There's one thing I won't miss from the IPL,8
Who wins the man of the series ?,1
shitttttt is rohit balding?,4
Did not know Big Man was at the stadium to watch the game [https://twitter.com/MohanlalMFC/status/1326159717354270721](https://twitter.com/MohanlalMFC/status/1326159717354270721),5
DC has showed fing no intent whatsoever.,2
5 trophies baby,5
Wow Rohit on his way to sixth IPL. Crazy. I just want one for ABD man,8
So is the Post-match thread up!? I'll better go make some Karma!,11
Ponting is gonna explode after this match.,8
DC should be happy that its just T20... Else rohit would have scored 200+ after that mandatory sacrifice of best player in run out,19
MI should end this quick for the NRR.,9
"Rabada is such a really good bloke. I'm stoked that he's playing in the final and I know they're in the backfoot, but I want him to at least get a wicket. He deserves it. Had a pretty good tourney despite the current circumstances.",6
Looks like everytime SKY gets run out Rohit blasts the hell out of the bowling,3
Delhi Capitals should put out a tweet: STOP THE COUNT!,6
I will miss Dream 11 Dhawan's Ad though.,4
"Kids get sad because their favourite team is losing, men get sad because they realise this is the last bit of dugout for next 6 months.",8
No superover in finals?? scriptwriters are subverting the expectations..,12
When do teams tell they want to take a timeout. Just now umpire instantly signalled timeout.,3
"Tbf, i'll buy if they ever made a squezzy toy modelled after Pant.",9
"When I first heard of Ishan Kishan, the words used to describe him werr 'Right-handed Rishab Pant'. He's really grown throughout IPL",3
Still not as one sided as 2011 IPL final.,1
"Wtf is wrong with you rohit prick, Play for NRR, why take deep.",11
Can we talk about how good Axar Patel has been quietly for DC this season?,6
"DC gosh darn it, you blew it. Empire wins again.",1
ez game for mi,5
If this was an ODI Rohit would have scored a double,10
"Before today, the last time both captians had scored half century in an IPL final was way back in 2016 - RCB(Koach) vs SRH(Warner)

kOhli Doesn't PeRFOrM In playOFfs",3
"Axar's figures are mighty impressive, shame no one could do the same from the other end",4
"I miss Mi-CSK finals . As much as we lose , we atleast make it seem competitive and have everybody on their toes .",20
STOP THE COUNT !,4
Axar going economical as usual. Like our battimg shitting the bat as usual.,3
Axar & Ashwin bowled so well.  MI took on Rabada & Nokia,8
Pollard Hardik Krunal Bumrah yet to come lol,9
"The best team is gonna win the tournament. As it should be.

Well played MI",25
"After the day with 2 super overs, every game except CSK-KKR and the eliminator has been one sided",16
"At the end of the first innings, i legit thought there's something in the pitch for the bowlers etc. and that 156 is a decent total... then Quentin's hitting told me DC were just terrible today, plain and simple.",5
One sided final :(,5
"Atleast I can cheer Bihar election, if not DC win :(",1
Forever indebted to DC for knocking out SRH for us <3,5
Who's that big unit besides Rohit Sharma?,1
Both the captains turned up today,1
"Rohit Sharma is Balding :,(",0
"This MI team reminds me of the Golden State Warriors after they got Kevin Durant, the playoffs were boring and everyone knew who was going to win but they all had that glimmer of hope that they wouldn't",5
"I am really sorry to say this, it looks like DC is content with a spot in final... cant see the stomach to fight... :(",1
So MI can break odd year rule by winning the title. Wait 2020 is still odd in a way.,4
The next big event in Indian cricket calendar is long flight to Australia and the awkward silence between Virat and Rohit on that journey üòÇüò≠,9
"That's the problem with Rabada, if he has an off day he goes for runs, and a lot of them. Archer and Bumrah can be economical even if they dont take wickets",8
"Well, this has been underwhelming.

DC should have chased perhaps.",1
"DC fans will be gutted. But they have made progress year on year. They‚Äôve made finals for the first time and reached qualifier 2 last year. I‚Äôd they follow the trend, they‚Äôll win next year. They have a good team. Just need to replace Hetmeyer with a better batsman and they‚Äôre good to go",7
"Other players - oh shit i got my partner run out.

Rohit - don't worry i will score your runs too.",9
Finally boult will win a major trophy,9
What's the best ipl final ever? 2019 is the best in memory for me.,-2
Mumbai brushing off discount Mumbai like some rubbish,11
"There should be an investigation on this MI team. No way a team can be this good, and dominate the hell out of the opponents. The most one-sided IPL ever.",8
WHERE THE FUCK IN NORTJE,3
Srsly think Axar is underrated. Unless I dont know and everyone rates him highly.,4
Rohit activated his India mode today because he is going to miss the T20s and ODIs against Australia.,10
Kishan should expload from here bring the RR below 4.,5
Good thing the team is not going to get nuked after this year. A chance at three peat if MI bag this.,6
CSK would have provided more entertainment now ffs,-1
Fair play award too wtf!,8
Behenchod even Fairplay is for MI.,4
Thank fuck. No more strategic timeouts this season,3
Dissapointed that DC fought so hard to get past SRH only for this performance,1
Stop the count!!,4
So glad to see Ponting's smile missing from his jerk face,3
Ok golden biceps do something,5
At least I make back the 100 coins tonight that I lost in the 2nd Qualifier,2
Even RCB showed better fight in the Qualifier,12
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",4
"GG MI. You were the favorites from day 1 and you played like champs till last day of tournament. Worthy winners and another testament of IPL's format.

To quote Macho Man - *The cream will rise to the top, ooh yeah*",9
I think the match could've gotten closer had Rabada bowled the 13th over better. Poor line and length to Rohit who's set in when you've got an arsenal topped by yorkers is just naive.,2
Spread the love brother!,3
"""Nice guys do come first"" lmao",6
"I still don‚Äôt get why Rohit is not playing LoIs. 

Maybe after Virat asked for Maternity leave, Dada intervened and made sure Rohit will play, at least, the tests. Sort of a truce.",4
Idk I don't want to count my eggs before they are hatched but MI on their way to get their 5th.lets goooooooo,8
Fuck off with these changes,1
For the sake of the rest of Ipl. PLEASE hold a mega auction lmao,7
Pommie lol,2
"Rohit's massive body warps the fabric of spacetime which results in time dilation,   giving him an extra 1.5 sec to play the ball.",5
[deleted],1
Stoinis wtf?,4
Fuck you Ceat. You won't be missed.,8
MI winning the fair play award as well. Leave some for the meme teams FFS.,8
This match has been one long ass Mortal Kombat fatality,3
Lol Kohli [https://twitter.com/Nicks103/status/1325718312311910400/photo/1](https://twitter.com/Nicks103/status/1325718312311910400/photo/1),6
Rajasthan is so bad that we are at the bottom of the fairplay and point table,8
I'm gonna miss dugout commentary.,4
Stoinis gets tonked for 30 this over,2
Funny that they're winning their fifth IPL but there has been only one final at Wankhede,4
Forecaster thinks there is a 4% chance that MI will lose...what a moron!,3
Stoinis back - say goodbye!,2
So they want to save Nokia overs for next IPL,3
SA VS ENG is next,5
"Most boring final in recent years, atleast 2018 was unpredictable at the start",6
They've brought an Avenger in to try and turn this around,3
The problem with India is they are biased against left hand batsmen. They never seem to get a  long rope despite being better gthan their right hand counterparts.,4
"""Nice guys do *cum first""*  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)",5
"Shouldn't you be bowling out Rabada, Nortje, Ashwin now instead of going to your part-timer. There is no tournament after this.",5
I blame Ponting. Let Ashwin be Ashwin. He could have gotten a few mankads in this match if he had management support.,15
5 more runs to beat warners record,1
I told ya rohit will come back to form this match,5
"The way rabada has bowled its hard to imagine he's the leading wicketaker . Bowlers like bumrah, Boult and even archar were far better",1
Is it me of Fast bowlers pitching way too short today for DC?,4
"Rohit be like, ""Aag lage basti mein, hum apni masti mein""",8
Hey at least Rohit getting back in form could bode well for Australia. Silver lining out of this match.,2
"""Nice guys do come first"" üòÇüòÇ",5
Each dot balls are literally frustrating at this point,1
Just a hunch but I think MI might win this,1
"Now that DC has lost to MI 4 times in a season, they should stop using this copycat outfit. Go back to black+red (it was good) or something else. 

There can only be 1 blue team and that's MI!!",5
Dugout guys should start a podcast.,6
ROHIT 100 LOADING,2
So cute how people think this is not over. Common guys... script writers ran out of script after that 2 super over match. Don‚Äôt expect any twists now.,10
You can tell Rohit isn't confident with his hamstring.,2
This routine win is making up for the heart attack finals in 2017 and 2019,11
Where is nokia?,2
Wasn't this MI side built by Ponting too? and then taken over by Mahela?,8
Dont want MI to take this deep. Anything can happen if it goes down to last 2.,7
"Is this the most dominant IPL season by a team? 

Went 9-5 (with one meaningless loss to SRH). Most losses were really close (2 superover losses), while most wins were dominant. Ridiculous NRR lead over every other team. Not to mention, it was a competitive year as the worst team still had 14 points. And smashed both matches in the playoffs to win the IPL.",19
Bowls a HeavyBall‚Ñ¢,4
Stop with this bullshit MI. Finish this in 18 overs and end r/cricket‚Äôs misery,4
MI winning everything this season. Even Altroz,10
"who's the big ginger guy on MI bench?

e: james pamment",4
Finally he have a Six from Kishan,5
Fair enough. You lads were right at the time Pant played that shot. It was a good innings but it was a match defining shot.,6
with glasses Hardik will look like Gandhi,18
[deleted],-10
Ishan kishan six gets fireworks? Bc match baki hai abhi,4
Ishan Kishan hits a six. Wow,1
"Slow pitch and MI bowlers bowled slow balls. Did we learn anything from that, nope!!",3
So can we agree that Boult is the best new ball bowler in the world?,12
I hereby officially declare that I have lost all hope.,5
"MI at top of fair play table. BUT - it's easy to be nice when you're winning.

&#x200B;

Add 7 wickets to their score right now so we can test their fair play under all situations.",14
"Eh.

Fireworks lol??",6
Ok srh fans we get it. Dont be a cunt. Should've won against dc if you wanted to play finals.,16
Ok..can we wrap this one? It is boring as it is.,8
And thats a wrap,2
1 six and rrr is down from 7.09 to 6,3
Swann in form,2
There are 5 overs of your best bowlers left you dense fuck,0
"People should just keep a meme team trophy atleast it will be interesting

Points shall be decided by polls lol rcb will win every season",7
What a cracking shot!,0
How many times will commentators say that Ishan Kishan is a small guy but he hits big sixes? Hasn't he shown that enough by hitting the most sixes this tournament?,4
"CSK fans : Kanos is ours.
We : Kishan's ours!",4
"SRH fielding cost them the previous match.  
MI - SRH would have been much more competitive",3
Can‚Äôt believe kedar fucking jadhav got a chance to play for India before Kishan and SKY,9
Ishan DeKishan.,4
"I dont see any other team winning unless there is mega auction ,MI is way too OP.",4
Wow Ishan is special. Very special,2
Is Nortje injured?,1
GRAEME SWANN EARRAPE,0
Why did play Nortje today?,1
Calm down with the Rabada hate. He is going to be a legendary Test bowler and has done very well in IPL too,12
MI are so gonna use RTM on Kishan if there is a mega auction,6
Keep the entire same squad for next season. Add Woakes and Roy. Try to make Punter stay. We should be good for next season,3
Remember Chris Lynn isn't even in the starting XI for MI.,14
he threw the kishan sink at it lads (from dugout),16
Such is the might of this team that they're winning it without using 2 of the best finishers.,10
Destroy that Altroz!,9
What sort of ball is that from stoinis? Swing away at a perfect height,1
Brilliant chase by MI so far. Such a dominant side just amazing.,2
"So my fellow Delhi fans, where are y'all at in the five stages of grief? Anybody hit acceptance yet?",12
30 sixes!!,6
"This is first time Ponting losing a final in his career, Respect üî•",11
"Swanny lost it after Sanjay's pun ""he threw the Kishan sink at it"" just beautiful to hear",13
Rohit converts 2s into 1s,4

"Swanny is gold. He just said ""he threw the Kishan sink at it"". üòÇ",12

Ngl happy with the way Iyer and Pant handled pressure. That is a win for Indian team perspective.,9
No one would have predicted Kishan would score the most sixes in the tournament.,8

"Brohit time to get Ishan Kishan out, he is taking away your century",10
We dont have a orange  cap holder. MI does not depend on a single player. Its a team effort,10
Altroz and Swann - name a better one sided romance.,12
At least RCB would have provided a lot of drama.,3
"DC - 4 sixes

Rohit Sharma - 4 sixes",6

MI on course to become the first team to win back to back IPLs & not get banned for back to back years.,17
"Rohit will hit a four over extra cover to finish on 79 Not Out and do the ""I got this"" celebration as his team mates will come running out to jump over him.",4
Mumbai Indians completely destroyed delhi this season,5
This IPL should end with Swann and Bangar emptying a Uzi into the Altroz.,11
DC need to hand over the captaincy to Ashwin.,0
"hope BCCI doesnt miss the Ishan Kishan train

he looks good",15
[deleted],14
This has to be the most boring finals right? Was one sided from the start. At least SRH vs CSK had Watson going beserk after a very slow start,6
Never thought kishan would be leading six hitters.. What a player,10
"Lol Last 5 overs are left of Nortje And Rabada, Completely shit captaincy",1
Swann literally begging for free car from TATA.,5
Ffs Tata give that man a fucking Altroz and shut his mouth,3
Pollard after chemo talking to OG Pollard.,3
That was the last altroz hype for this year boys. IPL is over for me now.,4
"ffs delhi ,i thought you will show up in finals",3
If CI is to believed Ashwin bowler very off breaks in the last two overs. I mean Jayant got so much turn.,3
"Iyer did not want the fast bowlers to be injured in a lost cause.

What a leader!!",2

"Happy that pant played well finally tho, Been defending for ages now",9
Bangar and Swann lusting for a car is way funnier than it has any right to be.,8
Ishan Kishan become first uncapped player to complete 500 runs & leading run scorer in IPL2020¬†for MI,8
Ok delhites go to sleep in your polluted air now  therss nothing to see here,5
"I think we all agree that with the momentum, SRH would have given a tougher fight to MI than this shit show which we are witnessing rn.",1
Finish before last over pls,2
MI still have 5 batsman remaining and 600 SR jasprit Bumrah yet to come.,8
This is definitely the most boring final since the 2015 final.,4
Seriously Tata ought to give Swanny some Altroz swag in the least!,9
Whats the logic they teams won't be able to prepare for the mega auction due to corona? I mean like doesnt the auction happen in December anyways? What's changed now?,4
Scenes if Rohit does the calma celebrations because he is excluded from the white ball squads,1
Someone's injured,1
If TATA doesn't give that hatchback to Graeme Swann imma riot,10
Hopefully Ishaan & Rishabh become India's Bairstow & Butler in LOIs,22
[deleted],8
"How can everyone in the team be in such fine form!!? This should be illegal.. they should have a kedhar, rahane or finch! This is so unfair",24
He fucking chose to bowl Dubey over Rabada and Nortje üòÜ,10
DC is relying on two South Africans to get them through. Little did they know South Africans and knock out games have a troubled relationship...,14
Is Nortje injured?,2
"Joe Biden who ?


It's Jio Biden",19
I like how Swann‚Äôs friendship has turned Bangar from an uncle to a pisstaker.,17
Still no nortje? Is he injured?,3
Nortje injured?,3
"There has literally been no chink in the armor this year for IPL. Remember, Pandya hasn't even bowled this year.",5
"keep your best bowlers to the last 4, when the game's already lost beyond hope.",2
I LOVE YOU MI! THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GREAT MEMORIES ALL THROUGHOUT IPL!,5
Good shot Kishan!!,2
"Unless Nortje do a Narine, which he likely wouldn't, MI defends the ipl for the first time.",5
This feels so ruthless that I'm feeling sorry for delhi now,10
Rohit should retire from Indian cricket just now that would be greatest slap to his haters  and keep winning Titles for MIüî•,4
"Only disappointing thing for me today?

Didn't get to see Pollard smash.",13
[deleted],27
Stoinis opening was an exception. Else SRH would be playing today. At least they would have made it interesting.,9
So Rabada and Nortje aren't going to finish their quota. And bowling a legspinner vs Ishan. Braindead captaincy.,10
Ishan is too OP,14
"I love rohit's stroke play a lot, he doesn't muscle the shots even if he wants to hit it out of the park his stroke play consists of pure elegance",6
Making a final like a practice match,8
Kishan mar rha hai,3
Less than a run a ball,3
Fireworks for every Kishan boundary now?,1
Please tell me bcci dropped Rohit because of injury and not poor form. Playing for India and MI is completely different story.,6
This is the coming of the age season for Kishan,6
Imagine if Rabada doesn‚Äôt bowl out ü§£ü§£ü§£,2
"Rohit needs 4 more sixes to overtake Dhoni's IPL sixes tally. But too late now, next year maybe",7
This match is disappointing considering how competitive and explosive this IPL was,3
Where is Nortje?,2
"Ishan to rohit,- no century for you cap",8
Sloppy from big booty hetty,8
Dubey ne duba diya,4
Wtf? Why did Nortje not bowl?,4
DC saving Rabada for the crunch death overs is wise.,2
"Contrary to the public opinion , i didnt find this ipl to be rather entertaining or competitive , it was more of some team choking than matches being close due to great batting/bowling. 

Besides that weekend and most of punjab's matches , it wasnt entertaining as well 

Mi was a league above others with csk,rcb not getting home grounds , stokes coming late for rr and our injuries",8
What is intent of Iyer here? No Ranada/Nortje.,-1
Indian QDK and SKY has taken their game to next level this season,6
Number 5 baby,6
"Man, Pant has been a giant disappointment throughout the season. I know he did well today but Ponting or someone has to set him straight. Fitness is key and the dude like in his mid-twenties ffs.",2
Some spanking from Ishan Kishan,3
"I had no expectations, but I still feel disappointed for some reason.",5
I see your Pant and raise you my Kishan,11
MI  you are chasing 155 not 190,12
Just throw the towel in,2
"Rohit Sharma in IPL:

 50th Game: Scored Fifty

"Ambani money, match fix, MI chiters incoming??",7
"DC curse will stay. Fans will crib on Delhi 'Not Deserving' to be in the finals for weeks after this and not deny that Mumbai has been on another level since the start. They only had a connivincing loss vs RR who have the best players of Pace (Stokes, Smith, Buttler) and the second loss was a half assed team in which the loss didn't matter",9
Dead final,4

Can we have someone other than MI or CSK win the ipl from 2021 onwards it becomes so boring if only these 2 are winning it all the time,3
what a boring end to an otherwise thrilling season :/,5

Kishan performed badly in 2016 Under 19 World Cup which was a blessing in disguise as he got to grow his game in domestics because he was completely overshadowed by his opening partner Pant before this IPL.,11

2019-Chennai

Nortje and Rabada watching the team they carried suffocate right in front of them and not being able to do anything about it.,5
"Would've been nice to see a slightly more competitive final, but MI are the daddies of the IPL for a reason. Poor from the DC top order to mess up when it matters. I guess if the tournament was called ICC IPL we would've seen some brains on Dhawan.

This has just accelerated your defeat Dehli. Hardik and Pollard coming in to slaughter,7

Rabada at it again lmfao,1
Oh damn Rabada! <3,2
Lol MI wags acting as if that makes a difference,6
Mumbai giving the fans a chance to see all of our batsmen have one last innings this year,7
Appreciate MIs effort to keep things interesting for DC,7
"God-damn, just get the 10 runs. Why is everybody looking to score quickly ? NRR doesn't matter anymore",5
one last chuckle from that fabulous dugout team thanks to Lee and Lara. been such a pleasure.,6
"Fuck.

MI want to take it deep.",6
"Everyone wishing for mega auction next year because their owners couldn't do jackshit with their team. Kind of feels unfair to us but even if mega auction happens, we will still build a good squad, hopefully.",5
"Stat padding, this is why he will win the purple cap not the ipl cup.",5
pUrpLe cAp,1
"As more and more seasons go without a new Indian captain winning the tournament, the more people realise GG‚Äôs worth. 

Hats off to Gautam Gambhir for winning this tournament twice. So many have tried but very few succeeded. It‚Äôs been just Rohit and Dhoni as the only Indians to pull it off. Also they did it multiple times.",8
How do DC fans still have hope for a comeback?,6
Disagree with Sunny there. Gotta take this game for granted now,6
Mumbai winning today.. But tomorrow tabel will be reset with CSK on top,9
Just play run a ball... no need to hurry.,0
People actually cribbing about DC today shows how much they have changed from their glorious DD days of squatting at the bottom of the table.,5
Just begs the question why didn't they bowl earlier,4
Dafaq bois? Chill and rotate them strikes.,2
So lara brett demo was useless anyway since pollard got out on the next *fucking* ball,6
Pollard mate you had one job,4
Mrs Sharma is anxious even at this stage smh,8
God the hate for Iyer is real,7
Why do they give such reaction when they very well know the match is over already!?,5
Two back to back 3-wicket 19th overs by Rabada?,6
Consolation wickets lol,3
Only if all this shit happened like 10 overs ago,10
Can a hat-trick change things?,1
Such a loose shot. The ball was there to hit,6
"**17.1** Rabada to Pollard, OUT,  **147-4**

KA Pollard  b Rabada 9 (4b 2x4 0x6) SR: 225.00",4
"Mi: elegantly chase down a total

People who don't support MI: BoRInG FiNAl",13
"Rabada mate, the purples cap is already yours, calm down",7
But someone told me Rabada only takes tailenders wickets,6
"So, it was MI v/s r/cricket and still MI won lmao",11
"IPL till 11:30 pm ...next morning watch the entire Cricbuzz and Cricinfo commentary and maybe some sports tak if I am in the mood ...it‚Äôs already afternoon by then ...kill a few more hours with some Premier League podcasts ...and bam it‚Äôs already IPL time . Tmrw onwards need to find a new routine , god knows what",13
Ok rabada bowl a hat trick you are only going through that way,7
DELHI POLLUTION CAPITALS,1
And this kids is how it felt watching Australia in early to mid 2000s.,5
Sanjay Manjrekar is a disgusting human being (if he did say what people are saying he said),-4
Mumbai ka alg ipl krwao bhai,5
Thank you MI for the facade of interest,2
"Man, I can't help that there is always some match-fixing involved in IPL.",-4
"First Petroleum,then Retail, then Telecom, now IPL. They are taking everything man. (cries in corner)",5

"This is an accurate [tweet](https://twitter.com/Maganlal1303/status/1326203899720577025). Replace the overseas players on Mumbai with Indian ones and win the t20 world cup. KL, Kohli, Bhuvi and Natarajan.",8
Lmao love the cocky MI fans . GG tho,4
Pandu is here to finish it,2
Iyer - we r 15-20 runs short. Koach will be proud of that statement,8
DC losing 6 of their last 8 games. What a slow motion crash.,12
Just end this.,6
2020 has been an ODD year,8
Scotty again crying coz of Deano üò¢,3
Pollard only get out cuz he wants to give everyone a fair chance to gangbang DC,7
Mumbai giving all their key players a tribute by having them chip in a bit to help win the fifth title.,4
"If DC win from here I'll shave my head. 

Mark my words",15
This IPL for us is like 2007 50 overs WC for Australia. Almost.,7
"KXIP, DC: Maybe real IPL cup is the caps we won along the way!",10
"2014 KXIP runners up

2015 KXIP last

2016 RCB runners up

2017 RCB last

2020 DC runners up

Be prepared for disappointment DC fans",14
[deleted],17
"from next year onwards, MI should start with negative 10 points just to keep things even",9
That would be a game changing moment... if MI didnt have nearly 3 overs left,7
Pollard bagged the Altroz,5
Get that big dick six,6
DC started their campaign by winning a match they shouldn't have won out of no where...,3
"Lol, they are playing the song Bala as Hardik walks in.",10
Get Pandya and Kishan out and things miiiiiigggghhtttt get interesting,3
Where are those people who kept spamming some dudes tweet about how everything he predict was correct or something,8
Its over for MI,2
Don't do that. Don't give me that hope. It's too late,2
lol...10 more runs!,3
"Now I just feel sorry for kkr fans, had mi played like this against srh they would have gone to playoffs",5
if dc wins from here i will give everyone head,5
oh shit Pandyas next lol,7
Two final victories by a 1 run margin has spoiled us MI fans a lot. I'm literally sleepy right now,14
Give us a beaver trick Rabada!,3
Ishandar Kishan,2
Rabada can you make it a bit more interesting at the end.Maybe  2 more wickets?,5
Iyer revising speech,5
Delhi can WIN.... in Pollution Premier League,16
"It‚Äôs been a great journey with everyone this season

Bye",2
"Ishan ""Kanos"" Kishan",7
Kisan. My man.,2
Kishan is class,3
Ishan looks like an emo band kid,3
"There was a point in the match where Stoinis bowled more overs than Nortje. 

Like how can that happen and you remain the captain.",7
What's the point of winning Orange and Purple cap if your team cannot win the IPL?,5
Cheeky,2
MI could win the T20 WC the way they are playing,5
shit did not finish before 17.3,10
Player of the tournament to Kishan,4
We get the fair play trophy yessss suck it,5
Kishan cool head.,6
17.3 over mark missed,2
Rohit vada pav defeats iyer idli.,19
Its only fair if Kishan hits the final shot. Best batsman for us this season,8
Iyer is like don‚Äôt cry don‚Äôt cry don‚Äôt cry,9
Rabada 6 wickets in 6 balls this over will end it ofr DC.,4
"MI losing wicket at regular interval is like people showing Banana to a monkey which they don't intend to give him

Yea, DC is that ..... üòÇ",11
"Kishan outshone Pant this season. If he keeps this up, he will get an international call soon.",12
"Thank you MI for making me feel how Aussie fan's felt during their 1999-2007 run‚ù§Ô∏è Best thing about this, is that unlike Aus, MI wears blue (Not a fan of yellow. Fuck you yellow).",34
Rabada smiling üò≠,6
"http://imgur.com/a/03uUmjR

Something for DC supporters.",6
"Poor end to a wonderful season. Let's hope Starc comes next year, Joe Root the allrounder..and lord Sam Billings",6
 For whom were they saving rabada and nortje?,5
"17.3 crossed guys, lets congrats DC",14
"Cmon man, csk you need to pull up, without you winning is boring",2
"Hey MI please go fuck umpire or some shit, i wanna see kkr get fair play award",13
"Never in doubt Mumbai, never in doubt.",5
There goes my 30 coins. Again.,6
Super one-sided match on a weekday. Are we sure this is a final?,10
"Mumbai smashes 60 off the first 6

Iyer : I must save my best bowlers for the last 4 overs.",27
What a one sided final!,6
I hate this dj,2
The reason mumbai have indians in their name is because of the number of fucking players they have that could straight up play T20I's for india,10
when was the last time ashwin did anything in a KO game?,1
"Are Hardik and Pollard the two best closers in the IPL? Definitely the best duo, but imo, they might even be the top 2 individually in the IPL.

It's gotta be so damn comforting to MI top order batsmen knowing they got these two guys behind them to close things out.",6
Finally a Final where my heart isn't in my mouth,11
IPL + Fairplay Award double Let's Goooooo,7
Wow this would be Pollard's 15th t20 title. Unreal. Winner's mentality.,19
Yes make rabada and nokia bowl the last 4 years,5
This has been a complete domination. GG Mumbai,6
Kishan has matured a lot. He is not just looking to bang bang. Took it deep in so many matches with healthy SR.,6
Hope these guests...who all be present for the final presentation are covid tested.,3
Ambani's script writers have been on-point this season!,3
"That fucker hardick is like, was that a good ball?? Against me???",9
This useless cunt is just running in a bowling length,1
Why is Gill or Shaw rated better than Kishan??.... He seems like a sensible hitter,7
"Ahh gonna miss dugout. Bret lee, lara and swanny. pure gold",11
"It's tough for me to say anyone but MI deserved this. Consistent and dominant, by far the best team",14
Never seem anyone chew the chewing gum so furiously like Iyer,4
"The insane criticism Iyer is getting is insane. He is what 25, Rohit, Dhoni, GG all have so much experience. What were you expecting him to make tactical geniuses automatically? Reminder- 2 Seasons he has captained, 2 Playoffs including 1 Final",18
[deleted],14
How absolutely unselfish by SKY... he should be on right now but did what he had to do for the team victory,5
Kishan continuing,1
"Purple cap winner got absolutely spanked today. He had a good season but players like Bumrah, Boult, Archer and Rashid had a better tourney IMO.",20
"DC, KKR, RCB, SRH, RR, CSK, KXIP: gaya,khatam,tata bye bye, goodbye",6
Only SRH had a chance and still can‚Äôt believe they messed up against DC.,11
Can I ask why playoffs count for Orange and Purple caps? Doesn't seem fair to stellar players on terrible teams. Literally all other sports league stop their awards before the playoffs,19
3 in 2..................overs,9
Someone should create MI fans only celebration thread so we can sh#t on haters the way they would have if we had lost.,4
Boult is the real big match player. Breaks opposition back before they realize.,9
"6 balls, 6 wickets come on Nortje you can do it.",7
Rohit is now 6-0 in IPL finals. Maharashtrian Michael Jordan.,46
Easy to forget what DC used to be and how much they struggled. The rapid turn around in 2 years is still an achievement,8
"In both matches in playoffs matches between MI and DC, the team batting first was 108 after 14 overs.

Since then, only Mumbai looked like winning. That has to be on shit management and captaincy no matter how you want to spin it.",8
even rohit sharma looks bored,12
Doesn't matter what happen in the world. Doesn't matter how many weird things happen in the year. One thing that doesn't change is mota Bhai's ever increasing net worth and trophies in his team's cabinet.,14
Congrats MI!,7
"Rohit Sharma now has 6 IPL titles to his name. 

5 with MI, 1 with Deccan Chargers. Mad stat.",13
Damn! thats how total domination feels like.,7
Wait so name change only gets you till the finals?,7
Do MI fans even enjoy winning anymore?,5
Looks like Hardik wants to finish this with a Six.,4
Hope MI gets banned too just like CSK for few years,5
scripter writer didnt made a script for final after seeing iyer's captaincy oof,2
Big cheers to the post match threads. Made the games all the more fun. Thank you internet strangers.,10
So there will be some sort of auction for sure. Just please don't let it be a mega auction. Need this team to stay together one more year and to see them play in India.,8
Sucks that Rabada couldn't finish his quota of four overs.,3
Dhoni has hit more boundaries in the ads than the matches,11
"lEaP yEaR nEw cHaMpIoNs

EvEn yEaR fOR MI hAhA

The amout of low effort posts jesus",14
at least DC will win against MI next year first game!,7
Mi is hoarding trophies at this point,5

"Sourav Ganguly: "" Abey bhosdiwalo NatWest jaisa kuch close match banana tha na, ya kya one side bakchodi ha 2003 WC final jaisa""",6
Wonder if DC captain Ponting's mental disintegration tactics motivated Rohit to fuck them up so nicely.,1
well played MI,1
Ok ishaan hit the glory shot you deserve it,3
Can't fucking believe Nortje won't get to bowl his full quota,6
MI players are not even gonna rush onto the field like you typically see in the finals,8
This ain't IPL.. It's MIPL,3
Inb4 DC gonna transfer Pant and Axar to MI,2
Ah 2014 when KKR robbed us,6
Last over of the IPL,1
At least this ends the odd even nonsense.,6
Even year my arse! Let's go!,4
Double hattrick come on,2
Rohit Sharma is the actual definition of suffering from success.,10
"Haha fuck you all MI haters here. Another year, another win for the championes",10
Give Iyer an over or let someone else bowl. Why waste this moment for a typical fast bowler bowling dollies and ending it an anti-climatic way? Might as well see what Pant can do with the bowl.,2
"If we look at the Second to eighth places, this was the most competitive IPL. If you look at the top team vs all the others, I think the quality difference was more than recent years I think. Other teams were just not in the same league",3
Come on just yeet that goddamn ball now,2
MI is IPL's Australia now,1
This IPL was competitive but also had a really dominating team,1
"I don't care

Incredibly proud of this team

This is just the start",5
5th!!!!,1
Fuck man I didn't want hardick to hit it but I'm fine I guess,1
"**Purple Cap winner of IPL 2013**

Dwayne Bravo - CSK lost finals to MI.

**Purple cap winner of IPL 2020**

Kagiso Rabada - DC lost finals to MI.

‚Ä¢ Both Bravo and Rabada are the only two to take 30 or more wickets in an IPL season.",7
Tonk it Hardik. Out toh out,1
This MI side are the IPL equivalent of 2000's Australian team. Can't do nothing other than try your very best and still fall short of their collective brilliance..,6
The ooohhh from the announcer is seriously annoying.,1
Congratulations Mumbai,5
Super over,1

We have to do something to make this more competitive. MI is way ahead.,1

"Its been fun karmawhoring here, was a great relief from the Covid stress. 

Congratulations MI fans, your team has moonwalked to the title. What a beast! Hopefully someone will give y'all a break from winning next season :P

See y'all in the Aus series threads! GGWP",12
I hereby declare my gratitude to DC for knocking out SRH and to KKR for knocking out RR,10

Was supporting DC as underdogs but MI thoroughly deserve this win. They have been superior throughout.,6

Why would you bowl Nortje for only 3 overs? Iyer is a dumb captain.,5
scriptwriters thought this would make for an interesting finish,6
Lol lol lol,2

Mumbai should call a time out.,2
Lmao all the fans and players celebrating as if they've just won and then they lose a wicket is excellent comedy,3

Everyone should get to bat,2
8 teams 60 matches and almost 50 days of action and all pandu had to do was to score a run. He gets out instead. Aaj Woh Nahi Kara.,8

"Aw, I wanted 5 more wickets so it would be decided by a superover.",3
Honestly I've seen more cheers for a normal game win. It was clear MI was winning from the second week of the tournament. Way too dominant,17

Cant believe a final could be this anti-climatic. Pandya's wicket with 1 required makes it worse. This is underwhelming.,9

Guys let's face it. Ambani is too big for IPL and no other franchise can come close to it. They have a well-groomed system to which no other franchise comes close. Other teams got great players while Mumbai got a great team too,15
People think breaking up MI will be enough. This set up took Boult who had an avg IPL record to a purple cap contender. Took SKY from a decent Indian player to the best No 3 in the tournament. Give any decent player to this set up and they‚Äôll bring the best out of them.,22

Million thanks to everyone visible and incognito who gave us this pleasurable tourney from start to finish

Everything played out so well and smoothly in the midst of a pandemic; with not even a remotely visible blemish

The commentators as well as many game show hosts went above and beyond their own norms; one would think

They sure kept us hooked and entertained from start to finish; with never a dull moment or a thought to blink!!

CSK, RR, RCB, SRH, KXI, KKR all at multiple stages did well momentarily; eventually only flattering to deceive

While DC had a few hiccups along the way, MI played liked Kings; the Trophy seemingly tailor made for them to receive

Congratulate one and sundry associated with and / or supporting Team MI; they sure deserved to retain their IPL glory

These teams should give their shareholders (fans) dividends from the win honestly... These guys dont need the money..,9
What is the PSL prize money,3
Earlier they used to call every player to give medal. Is it because or covid that they're not doing it this time?,3
MIPL naam rakh do iska,5
MI RECIEVING MONEY IS LIKE PUTTING A GLASS FULL OF WATER IN FRICKIN OCEAN,10
"I think IPL has now achieved a position that foreign players look at it as the pinnacle of t20 cricket. Everyone wants to play in it, work hard and genuinely want to do good for their teams. Gone are the days of Pietersens and Flintoffs who came here because of their reputations and didn't bother to break a sweat.",27

What do y‚Äôall think is inside those boxes?,10
Mahela. Lucky to have him in the dugout!,22

Mehela apparently has blasted MI players at times. We demand the footage,12
Rohit: *yeh paisa tum rakhlo mein Australia ko jaata hu*,14
Rohit flexing his hamstring in front of Dada.,16
Legit question - does the money get taxed as per Indian or UAE laws? Big difference there,7
Nita Ambani's makeup expense for a week covered,9
He is walking gingerly....as he is wearing spokes. Damn good Harsha!!,17
Rohit is thinking to himself 20 crore rupees would buy him a hell of a lot of vada pav,8
we get diwali snacks in those boxes when distributed in the office.,6
Shreyas Iyer saying that Ricky is the best he's worked with must have angered Bewda and Koach. I doubt he'll get a chance in the Indian side now.,14
"ICC WC winning prize 30 crores. IPL winning prize 20 crores

Hence proved that BCCI deserves 67 percent of ICC revenue",7
20 Crores to the Ambani's? That should make up for tonight's drinks,9
if for some reason the sun decides to take holiday we always have harsha bhogle as substitute :),11

Just give the bloody cup and let us go,4
Finally someone asked about SKY and international cricket,13
Sri Lanka Cricket is too fucked up to not let the likes of Mahela and Sanga to revive cricket. They already proposed what needs to be changed but the idiots in the board and in politics can't get it done.,22
Trophy where,2
"Rohit saying he should have sacrificed himself for SKY is one of the biggest compliments SKY could get

This guy has hit two double hundreds just by running out people and he wants to sacrifice himself for you",73
The biggest disappointment in this IPL was Neesham. If only kxip used him well things would've been wayyyy different for them,12
Wish someone had asked the SKY question to Kohli instead,10
He said it !!! He said take care of your fitness on his face,21
"That was my first IPL season. Learnt a lot about a version of the game I had hitherto sneered at (sorry!), and most of all watched some pretty good cricket.

And y'all here on these match threads have been pretty awesome (except for the serial downvoter). Some high tension, close games, emotions running high... and yet pretty much everyone has been respectful. Just more proof that cricket is the best game, played by the best people ü§£",35

No stage this time for celebration,3
mark that sky kiss as NSFW. tf its been broadcasted on national television.,17
Important question: Did Swann get that Altroz?,9
Koach should seriously think about handing over the captaincy to Rohit for a few years to warm the seat for Shreays/Rahul. He should focus on his batting and chasing Sachin's records. Tendulkar didn't need to be captain after all.,19
"No there are times when Quinny has something on his mind, when he wears a hat!",4

Who is that player in the middle holding the trophy looking like Lalit from Mirzapur,7
"Such a sad period in Indian Cricket History, that Jay Shah is being given priority over BCCI President & Indian Cricket Legend - Sourav Ganguly!!!!!!",2
Swann should have been allowed to give away the Altroz prize and before handing it he should slap its roof and say this bad boy can fit so many people inside,18

"Noooo ipl is over, guess we‚Äôre back to our shit lives again",7
"Are you gonna still keep mum over Sourav Ganguly getting sidelined every time, and Jay Shah being given priority? I am mad over this! Dada is the BCCI President & Indian Cricket Legend. Who is Jay Shah? This is not unfair and certainly not right!!!",14
"Mumbai might as well pick up Archer and ABD and win for the next 5 years. Srsly tho, credit to Mumbai for trusting Sky and developing Kishan who had an amazing tournament. This team looks too tough to beat.",27
Srh would have fared better than dc,9

"Too bad we didn't have the iconic ""Rohit running towards the pitch while taking off his cap"" moment this year",38

"Meanwhile, let's appreciate this young captain - Shreyas Iyer too, who brought his team to the IPL final. The way Shreyas Iyer has captained the entire season and batted so well scored 500+ runs in this season, it's just fantastic!",18
"Is it just me or did the last few games seem very monotonous, there was barely any intent even from the teams that were playing must win matches; there were no close matches at all; there was no hype like previous years while going into the playoffs; no on field rivalries in the semi final games. Maybe it was the bio bubble effect on the players mind which made them fatigue but at no point did we see a team that gave its all to win. I don‚Äôt know if this makes sense but normally the ending matches are so hyped compared to this year.",23
" May not be today, May not be tomorrow - but one day everything will be alright.",10
