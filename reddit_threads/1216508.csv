2020-10-04T08:16:23+00:00,wingzero00,"If Bhuvi's injury is serious, out chances for the tournament are pretty bleak. He's pretty much the lynchpin of our bowling attack. 

If they want Stanlake in I could see them dropping Willaimson, but it's a tough call. 

Nabi isn't in consideration because all the games in this ground have shown that normal cricketing shots are enough to succeed and there's no need to slog. 

If Willaimson does play I hope he has a day out like [the Nz vs Ind T20 game this year](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19322/scorecard/1187679/new-zealand-vs-india-3rd-t20i-india-in-new-zealand-2019-20). He was unbelievable, Bumrah bowled pretty well there but he just read him so easily and even hitting yorkers for 4's. 

Warner and Bairstow need to take the game on more if we bat first, they're probably the big hopes of getting a target that's hard to chase down in this ground (if that's possible).

We're definitely the underdogs in this match, in a way that's sorta calming because there's less pressure here.",9
