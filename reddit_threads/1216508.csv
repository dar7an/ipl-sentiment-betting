"So, MI will go to the top of the rankings.",3
So who'll pull off a Tewatia today? Krunal or Rashid.,1
"If Bhuvi's injury is serious, out chances for the tournament are pretty bleak. He's pretty much the lynchpin of our bowling attack. 

If they want Stanlake in I could see them dropping Willaimson, but it's a tough call. 

Nabi isn't in consideration because all the games in this ground have shown that normal cricketing shots are enough to succeed and there's no need to slog. 

If Willaimson does play I hope he has a day out like [the Nz vs Ind T20 game this year](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19322/scorecard/1187679/new-zealand-vs-india-3rd-t20i-india-in-new-zealand-2019-20). He was unbelievable, Bumrah bowled pretty well there but he just read him so easily and even hitting yorkers for 4's. 

Warner and Bairstow need to take the game on more if we bat first, they're probably the big hopes of getting a target that's hard to chase down in this ground (if that's possible).

We're definitely the underdogs in this match, in a way that's sorta calming because there's less pressure here.",9
I don't have a good feeling about the game today. Feels like Davey ji and Jonny B gonna cunt us everywhere and kill us.,5
I'm afraid Rohit sharma or pollard might murder us if bhuvi doesn't start. Too nervous right now,9
"Rohit can target a 200 on this ground if he bats first, particularly if Bhuvi is not playing",10
"Everyone talks about what Warner, Bairstow, Kanos, QdK, Rohit, Kishan, Pollard and Hardik can do on this ground but I feel like someone unexpected will shine in this game. Abdul Samad, or Abhishek or Krunal, one of them will play a big innings today.",7
Pollard and Ishaan should open the innings with Hardik at no. 3 üòÅ,0
"Everyone is talking about MI murdering SRH on this ground, but somehow I feel MI is going to have a poor start and then not adequately make up for it in the end",4
"Friendly reminder that SRH‚Äôs middle to lower order consists of 19 year old Priyam Garg, 20 year old Abhishek Sharma, 18 year old Abdul Samad and 16 year old Rashid Khan",44
"Today's match is insane firepower. If teams are scoring 200 relatively easy here. Then imagine Rohit, Polly, Kung fu and Warner, Bairstow, Williamson's gonna do  today. 

Nattu and Bumrah can make the difference today. So do Chahar and rashid. Today's match too exciting too miss. I might not watch CSK vs Kxip dead rubber pretty much",8
[deleted],8
Up for some Harddicc action,3
"In this match we will see lots of 6 hitting from MI and SRH.

In the next match we will see some test match batting from CSK followed by an exhibition in NRR damage limitation.",45
"Checked Sharjah weather, 37 degrees with 43% humidity, out in the sun, it will feel like 45+.... At least the fielders won't have to run much with all the 6s that will fly around.",9
"Dear star, can we talk about today's match please??",5
Star Sports CEO is a big MSD fan isn't he? Whole pre show is dedicated to him even if it's not CSK's game. So cringey to hear Lara and Brett Lee keep talking about MSD comeback. Hurts eyes and Ears üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠üò≠,7
Which is the app you guys use to check 1) cricket scores and 2) other sports scores?,2
[deleted],8
Srini Mama has shares in Star Sports or what?,3
"Everybody here : Today every batsman from SRH and MI is going to hit 10 sixes each.

Bowlers : We have one skill. It is absolutely usless when we find you. Honestly we dont know what we're going to do with our skill. BUT GODAMMN IT WE ARE GOING TO FIND YOU!!!",6
Fuck lions... All my homies like eagles,18
"Breaking News: Star Sports won't broadcast IPL play offs if CSK doesn't qualify for Top 4. 



üòØüòØüòØüòØ",3
"Man I am confused whether we should bat first or chase, in this heat we should bat but any total can be chased in this ground like we saw last match. I know KKR didn't chase it but they should have if batting order was correct",2
I don't know why I just want to see Krunal Pandya get smashed nothing against MI though.,17
Only chance for SRH to win is a century by Warner or YJB or in all likeliness both,-1
Is bhuvi playing?,4
"If MI can negate Bhuvaneshwar  and rashid , Pollard and hardik gonna set the score to 250 today",2
"So I have to just messege "" Mumbai will win it easily"" every over to jinx Mumbai.. Right????",11
"So many comments about Rohit but Rohit rarely scores two matches in a row, I hope I am wrong though.",7
"Pollard has been striking at 200+ all year on rank Turners, can't wait to see what he does with a ground like this, even if it's a used pitch.",4
Please tell me Kane‚Äôs starting,2
Murli FakeLaugh Kartik,3
Man the entire star sports crew simps for dhoni and it‚Äôs disgusting. Just call a spade fucking spade you wooden headed poltroons,6
"Rashid Khan Vs Rohit Sharma

Age is just a number Vs Weight is just a number",77
"As a DC fan it's hard to decide who to favor. 








Don't want Mi to win and take the top spot 















But also don't want Srh to win cuz they have won against us.













Cant both the team just........lose?",13
"*scenes at the toss*

Rohit: ye main kar leta hoon, tum dream 11 pe team banalo

Warner: Speak English",72
I swear I had a dream yesterday night that Rohit scored 202*(79) with a six in the last ball of the innings,17
"Almost all SRH threads inevitably devolve into ""reverse jinxing"" cringe. For once can y'all not?",16
Mi bat first please.,5
MI vs SRH in afternoon games - SRH 2  MI 1,3
That was awkward,7
Mumbai Indians have won the toss and have opted to bat,2
Rip us. Congrats MI on the win today.,12
I thought MI would go with Lynn on this ground,1
Can MI score 300 today?,1
"Bhuvi not playing, srh well played but hard luck",4
Knuckleball CC is in full effect now,6
Lmao Davey doesn't remember the team changes,3
Mi won the toss and chose to  Win first,9
MI is gonna shit the bed today,5
Did Warner call Rohit as Rahul or is it just me?,2
LMAO Warner can't remember the changes in his team.,6
Test for our bench strength,2
"‚ÄúDavid Warner says they would have batted too as Sunrisers are a good defending team themselves. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is missing. Sandeep Sharma replaces him. Khaleel has been left out, but Warner can't remember *_who is replacing him_*‚Äù",9
Simon Doull‚Äôs has probably one of the lowest head to body ratio,4
"Kane is playing, pls daddy spank bumrah like you did in that T20I game at the start of the year.",7
SRH fans get the reverse jinx A game to every fucking game thread!,1
Lack of TikTok has taken a toll on Warner‚Äôs mental health. Hope he recovers soon.,44
We will know how much have Sandeep and kaul improved,3
"SO if Brohit survives the first 10 balls, he is getting 100 today right?",6
"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): David Warner(c), Jonny Bairstow(w), Manish Pandey, Kane Williamson, Priyam Garg, Abhishek Sharma, Abdul Samad, Rashid Khan, Sandeep Sharma, Siddarth Kaul, T Natarajan",2
Any news on Bhuvi‚Äôs injury? How long is he gonna be out for?,2
Can I watch Dugout commentary on Hotstar?,1
"First part of the job done, Rohit batting first, against Sandeep, Kaul, Natarajan, in Sharjah, this can be very big.",3
*Kungfu Pandya* cringe intensifies,5
The fear the reverse jinx because it works /s,1
Alright pretty stupid of SRH to only go with 4 proper bowlers on this ground especially with Bhuvi not being there,3
Great opportunity for Kaul to hit a half century,7
I get foreign captains have difficulty pronouncing Indian names -  yesterday Smith saying *that‚Äôs the one* when Rajpoot was the one left out and today Warner not remembering who is replacing Khaleel is something I am not too happy about . Get professional please - would Smith and Warner have forgotten the names of Aussie players - I bloody think not . Downright disrespectful.,15
Bhuvi is temporarily out right??,5
Against Mumbai at a postcard sized ground without your spearhead bowler. What could go wrong? 250 on the cards?,4
Headband representative of SRH is back on Sharjah.,5
[deleted],7
SRH have a better chance of winning since they are chasing here,2
MI wants to go gang bang the NRR,3
Brett Lee just said sid kaul is an absolute champion. Wow,4
"Let me get this straight, SRH is going to chase against Rohit, Pollard, Pandya and they don‚Äôt have a single experienced fast bowler and it‚Äôs Sharjah and they expect to win today?",7
Imagine losing bhuvi AND get kaul in the playing XI. Thats a shot on each ass cheek of SRH,18
"So one run machine out, and two in",11
Sharjah....,5
What‚Äôs up bitches? Hope today‚Äôs match will be entertaining and full on paisa wasool!,0
"Can't decide what's worse, the lone serial downvoter in every thread or the fans who reverse jinx everytime their team plays ü§∑",6
"Let's have the obligatory vote.

Brohit or Nohit today?",3
Kaul and sandeep in. i'm expecting atleast 250 xD,5
"What's the point in showing performances against a specific team? A specific bowler yes makes sense, a team? Really?",3
"i feel like this is one of those matches where rohit, pollard fails and yadav and krunal pandya will shine",0
Let's just hope QDK finds form today,6
It's better for us to start death bowling from the ball 1 with this bowling line-up.,6
I would have been tempted to play Nabi ahead of Williamson/Bairstow if I was SRH. Getting overs out of Samad and A Sharma on this ground will be very difficult even if dropping a batsman would weaken their batting.,1
What's the over/under for Mumbai scoring 300 here?,5
"I am scared. Sandeep and Kaul are playing their first match this season. I fully expect them to get tonked by MI.

Edit: Forgot Sandy played the first match. Still doesn't gives confidence though.",4
Hit that upvote button guys!!,-1
Is DeKock playing today?,1
One of the SRH medium pace bowlers is gonna break the ipl record for worst figures(4-0-70-0) and I think it‚Äôs gonna be Sandeep Sharma,4
Some of these question the presenters ask are downright dumb,2
"I remember a similar hype before the india Afghanistan world Cup match where rohit was expected to score his fourth double or third triple and ended up getting one. 

It's a bowlers graveyard, but the heat and humidity cannot be ignored. Explosive innings are likely, long ones not so much. I expect a surprise from this match",9
Why does Binga like Sid Kaul so much?,2
264??,4
"Pandey scored real good last time vs MI and is currently in form, so the top order of SRH is looking quite dangerous. If middle order can go like it did last game, that should be real fun to see",6

Sunreversejinxers Hyderabad,12
"Lmao , let's have some faith in our side despite the reverse jinxing‚Ñ¢. 
 We can restrict them to a chase able score, I trust our bowling they have usually never let us down.",1
Don‚Äôt make it a super over thing pls,5
Wtf Bhuvi.is always injured lol,-3
Today in Rashid's 4 overs if we score 30 then 220 from remaining 16 should be easy..... I think,3
Matches at Sharjah are as good as 20 over Super overs.,5
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs concerning that they haven‚Äôt said much about Bhuvi. Might be a minor strain and don‚Äôt want to reveal to the opposition when he‚Äôs back,3
"Is there any time SRH are treated as favourites? I always see people calling other teams as the favourites including teams like DC, KXIP previously. Wtf. We have 5-5 record against MI FFS and we did defend low totals against MI.",7
It's Mumbai's match to lose already.,1
Rohit needs 10 sixes to overtake Dhoni and become the leading Indian six hitter in the IPL,7
Am i the only one waiting for big ben?,1
"Here is my prediction:

SRH will require 3 off the last ball.

The commentators will be talking about Dhoni while that last ball is being bowled.",38
Star sports licking Dhoni's ass is like Indian media doing propoganda for the government.,39
If the pitch doesn't offer any swing then it might be a long day for Sandeep  Sharma. Hope I'm proven wrong.,3
I would say MI have an advantage but you don't need power hitters on this ground batsmen who can place and time properly can also score a lot of boundaries because the boundaries are short so Warner and Williamson can be very good on this ground. The bigger difference is in the bowling though.,6
So much reverse jinxing happening here as Star Sports keep simping on MSD,11
Not playing Lynn at Sharjah is such a tragedy.,8
[deleted],13
Sharjah looks beautiful from aboveüëåüèΩ,5
Sandeep with his pace and no swing will probably break the worst bowling figures record in IPL,4
"So, non-Mumbai fans in this thread, who are you all supporting?",3
SRH bowlers except maybe Rashid look like cannon fodder today.,3
"Wear masks and maintain social distancing.

Covid-19 pandemic ain't over.

Take precautions. Be safe !!",4

I wonder if he ever saw Bairstow and Warner on song",7
"Avg 1st innings score: 223

I don't feel so good fellow reverse jinxers",6
Should have Bought in Holder for Kane just for this match especially with bhuvi gone. Holder bowls well with new ball and can hit Sixes towards the end,6
"On Paper we have 8 batsmen. Going to be a 200+target,Unless Rashid does something.",5
Smash that upvote button! Let‚Äôs get this to 10k comments todayüëçüèΩ,4

It's like watching the game with your close pals.",14
They should add 1 bounce 1 hand rules to make it more fair for the bowlers at Sharjah /s,8
"If your team is playing at Sharjah, only watch it bat. Watching them bowl will cause you depression.",6
"I know this is going to get downvoted a lot but I really have not enjoyed the 3 games in Sharjah, I mean I like big hitting but the bowlers hardly have a role here.",7
I‚Äôm gonna look like a complete dumbass here but MI either gets 250 or will fold for 100,4
How many of the SRH bowlers will get their half-centuries today?,3
Russel was the only bowler who barely got whacked yesterday due to PACEEE and great mix ups.... Dont see any bowler for SRH capable of it today,1
240 up today?,1

Hype up with the shitty copter baby.!,3
Really feel like SRH should have played Billy Stanlake in this game. 5 full time bowlers are needed in Sharjah.,3
Sounds strange but I am worried about our bowling today. Specially for Sandeep and Siddharth.,3
Sandeep used to be excellent for Punjab but pretty average for us :(,7
Swung so much felt like an off cutter,6
SRH had only one strength - balanced bowling attack. Well it's fucked now.,3
Dropping Bairstow for Stanlake could not have done much worse than this.,5
woke up at 6 am for this lets gooooo!!,4
300 on the cards boys since no bhuvi.,3

Hotstar live chat is so cancer,4

"Sharjah was getting worried about its reputation, but Kaul has come in to assure everyone that 200 is still on",6
Kaul getting Kaulered,2
Kaul has money on MI over 202.5 runs,2
Why tf are people downvoting? Literally braindead folks,5
If the ball is swinging why isnt sandeep bowling,1
thank god rohit's not there to run SKY out,-3
Regardless of outcome just don't even think of going of any of these medium Pacers(including Khaleel) in next auctios. Just invest in Natarajan and decide about Bhuvi based on his form.,1
You've done it Kaul. You've made me want Khaleel in the team now,2
Fuck Cred. Only got 5rs cashback,8
Wtf Kaul fuck off,5
I know how much Kaul‚Äôs gonna go for in next auction,4
Suryakumar looks hungry after getting unlucky this year so far,1
Where are the bullshit test match comments?,1
I guess SRH wanted a like for like replacement for Khaleel but this is too similar,10
What is it about the headband? Even Steyn is MIA since he donned that headband and conceeded 50+,1
"Yadav is silky smooth.

E: lol, why am I getting downvoted for praising his batting?",3
Lord Dinda's spirit lives on....,1
We want khaleak back,8
Suryakumar Yadav is one of my favourite batsmen to watch - his shot making is almost regal.,1
"cred bhenchod,got only 10rs.",6
Khaleel pls come back,6
5D move by Rohit to get dismissed to a pacer to not further dent his record against the spinners. Rashid was bound to get him today,10
RCB to buy Kaul next auction,15
"\*MI in Trouble*

Mota Bhai: ""Better Call Kaul""

u/Motabhai_official",15
Have SRH released mustufizur??,-2
let the ball get old and start hitting boys.,4
dekock straight up not having a good time rn,-1
Kaul doing the impossible: people be begging for khaleel to return XD,8
[deleted],-6
What kinda action is that?,0
That‚Äôs a good point from the commentator,4
How the hell was Rohit out?,-3
I used to remember Sandeep Sharma bowling for KXIP and he was unplayable then. Hope he finds his rhythm soon.,5
[deleted],8
Natarajan and Sharma start brilliantly and Kaul ruins it all lmao,6
[removed],2
unbelievable that there are still some folks using words like dinda academy unironically. I mean what's stopping you from banning them mods?,6
Why those lines boys?,2
[removed],4
Is Khaleel also injured??,-1
Murali Kartik is shit,-3
Rohit looking in pain thinking of the 200 he missed out on as he watches SKY just casually touch the ball away for 4,1
Can't Murli Kartik and others notice that Sandy was out for an over getting taped as he did his leg a bit. Just keeps on blabbering shit saying Warner did a mistake by taking him off for an over.,17
did sandeep remodel his action? looks different,-5
Khaleel dropped for faking injury,-7
Khaleel vs Siraj. Whose is worse ?,2
Quinton is awfully out of form,7
Rohit Sharma 200 today,6
They again played de kock?... Tf they bought Chris Lynn for?,-6
I think that one more failure would mean Kishan would don the gloves for us and Lynn would replace DeKock,5
[deleted],-5
Did they not see Sandeep getting patched up after he was hit by the ball?,7
Imran Khan is the GOAT,-8
[deleted],5
Sandeep swinging close to 3 degrees and warner decided to replace him with kaul after one over ‡≤†_‡≤†,6
Chris Lynn would have been fantastic for Sharjah,5
What happened to de cock? He hasn't looked comfortable till now in this IPL.,1
People were expecting a different Sharma to perform today lmao,3
The only batsman SRH didn‚Äôt consider a threat was Yadav and now we r getting fked,4
Karma Reduction Thread apparently...,7
"I‚Äôm guessing Suryakumar,Pandya,Warner,Kaul will all score 50+",4
"SKY has been in Mumbai Domestic Team for so long.

If he had conducted himself better and had a bit more commitment to his game, he would have been in the National Team selection Radar a lot sooner",-7
What the fuck are these Flipkart ads trying to convey? The ones with Alia Bhatt and Virat Kohli.,0
DAE think Kane and Morgan make better captains for their teams?,-5
Rohit injured today or what?,-8
Such a de motivating ground for bowlers.,-1
Lol peeps gotta run upvoting bots also now smh,3
People really saying replace dekock with Lynn who couldn't buy a run in the cpl. People on the bench aren't always better.,3
shaky four but still gives a confidence boost,2
"Begun, it has.",-5
SRH so kind as to bring de kock back into form,-1
Looks like r/cricket is trying to meme decock back in form,5
"Revised up to 260 now.
80 (9) + 80(7)+ 100(4)",-2
[deleted],5
Lmfaoooo Scott Styris making cock jokes in the dugout,8
No timing at all,4
I wish we had dugout in hotstar. Comms are horrible this ipl.,4
[deleted],3
There's a whole downvote brigade here today lmao. Enjoy your time if that what gets you off fellas,3
De kock totally struggling here. If you don't regain form in Sharjah you're not gonna do it anywhere else.,6
Wicket alert,-2
No timing for QDK. I feel like he will lose his wicket soon,-6
"""Good battle between the Nutt and the Cock today"" - Binga",6
"So much ""negativity"" in the thread",-1
Oh oof. The downvoters are even stronger today than general,4
Brett Lee played with KKR. Fitting because he's a BingaLee,3
Why would you attempt shit ass high risk shots like that when you can mishit one for a 6? Stupid hacks!,6
"Bowling nattu, keep the pressure on boi",5
üòé,-3
"Interested to hear everyone‚Äôs predictions.

Which bowler will concede the most runs in a 4 over spell at Sharjah this season?",3
Nattu was bowling really good,5
Pathetic start from MI... not looking good,-4
"When half of the runs in the first five overs have came from Kaul so far, lmao",-1
Isse seedhe shot to pad nahi rahe chala abd banne,-3
Is Warner going full Hyderabadi with the moustache and all?,6
We have to upvote the downvoted comments to maintain universal balance,4
Haha that cricbuzz ad is lit!,5
"Fuck dude, ball's not event connecting",2
Nattu steaming in,5
Still can't get over how smooth that first six was. Didn't even look like he was taking efforts,6
Damn remove kaul off the equation and SRH bowling today's looking lethal. SKY and cockie can't even get the contact right,6
"Suck my dick ,downvoter",-2
"5 overs done still no sixes

This is not what i was promised",2
They are giving this local lad too much respect. Get out and thrash him for 2 sixes. He will start panicking,5
Why THE FUCK would you give kaul an over again?,15
Khaleel wasn't this bad lmao,4
"Powerplay scores in Sharjah till now

54, 53, 60, 69, 57, 59",5
"Kaul, wtf",4
So many apps begging to upload funny videos,9
WHY SID KAUL HE IS JUST KHALEEL BUT RIGHT HANDED CMONNNNN,10
Murali Kartik for 8 overs is just plain torture.,12
Lmao most of the comments have down votes wtf,2
kaul coming to give much needed relief,14
Kaul 50 coming up,7
"SKY and Kaul, what a love story",11
Downvoters get a lifeü§£,8
this Kaul bloke looks a bit shit,7
I request everyone to upvote everything to rule those downvoters out.,11
Kaul brought back for re-balancing the score before powerplay.,8
Bruh Brian Lara always seems embarrassed in the dugout,6
"Khaleel is soo much better than kaul, they both give you pies but atleast khaleel has a knack of getting wickets",11
"It's fun to upvote all the comments
Downvoters tired I guess now lol",7
Yeah downvote this,3
Who in there right guy mind gives kaul another over!!,5
Babyface Qdk going at a solid 110 strike rate. Johnny sins Lynn would have 35 by now at this pitch.,3
Who the hell is this guy? Where is the long haired kaul?,5
"You guys realize that you're giving these downvoters the attention they desire by calling them out, right? Ignore and they'll eventually get bored.",7
This is some serious slow batting this. Fuckin cunt it you idiots! Hit bhenchod!,2
Sid Kaul whyyyyy,4
"Kaul, man. Just bowl good length on off stump line already....",5
"Much like Maxwell, buying De Kock is a scam.",-1
Hope these downvoters are at least getting paid,7
Lynn would have 40 by now,6
This is just bad bowling,7
"Fair to say end of IPL career for Kaul? 

This is fucking pie factory from here.",7
"Ok, Khaleel is much better",6
"Who tf is this Brian Lara in the dugout and what does he know about cover drives? Lol.

Get me Ashish Nehra please.",16
I was extremely harsh on Khallel.,6
The only way MI can lose here is because of the expectations. Rohit went slashing every ball just because they had a big figure in their mind. MI can just play normally and get to a big score rather than forcing themselves,6
What the actual fuck üòÇ,9
"wtf is ""into-out""",8
Holy shit. That was unexpected lmfao,17
I take it back Khaleel is better,10
That was unexpected!!,6
"Shit gets wickets

Awful dismissal",10
Whats up with getting out on wack balls ?,12
Kaul do not celebrate that. That was a disgusting ball,20
Sid has the last laugh eh?,8
DARTH,8
Did not see that coming wtf,11
Overconfident from SKY. FFS,12
Shit vs Shit,3
QDK start fucking playing man,3
"Got wicket with a shit ball. That's Sid Kaul, alright!",7
Why the fuck is he bowling full,8
Memebai gonna be memebai! Hahahahahahahahahahaha... You fuckin twat!,9
Oh no,6
KAUL: FUCK R/CRICKET,11
Kaul shuts \cricket,5
Goddammit!!! Another soft dismissal,7
Ok bois!! Kaully guy struck gold! Free upvotes for everyone now,10
"Kaul : *yeah, now talk na r/cricket*",13
üòê,4
Fuck that is the very definition of shit gets wickets,8
Moral of the inning - Shitty balls gets wickets,10
kaul redemption arc?,8
Lmao we got lucky,12
üò¥üò¥,2
"Kaul bowls:

Sky: hippity hoppity it‚Äôs my property",10
Thats more of Yada‚Äôs brain fade than Kaul‚Äôs wicket,9
Fucking got lucky,4
Haha that's just like the Stoinis wicket yesterday. Just bowl outside leg and hope it gets caught.,9
"**5.5** Kaul to Yadav, OUT,  **48-2**

SA Yadav c Natarajan b Kaul 27 (18b 6x4 0x6) SR: 150.00",6
Fuckboi next pls vada paw,8
Mumbai are determined to defy expectations,9
They should have picked billy stanlake over Bairstow for this match. Their bowling is hot garbage today.,3
Yaay wicket for us lol,5
Damn! This is the biggest example of shit gets wickets,15
So often the worst delivery takes a wicket.,13
Gor lucky that should have been a 4,8
In the end Yadav‚Äôs brain faded more than Kaul,6
Rashid vs Pollard time.,10
Always had faith in Kaul,6
"Anything less than 200 feels under par at Sharjah, 50 after the power play feels low given the pretty average bowling",6
absolute garbage from Kaul but I love it,9
"SKY usually gets out around 20-30

the Indian Vince",16
I like that Kaul didn't celebrate the wicket like crazy as some of the bowlers have been doing.,10
YRKFA hasn't bowled a ball yet. Lol. Good fuckin luck you jackasses!,10
SKY has himself to blame for that. It was a poor deliveey,20
I remember a few years back Kaul bowling really well. What happened?,22
[removed],15
Hey that ad about licking the donkey is pretty clever. The guy says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to lick (ass) to climb up the ladder‚Äù.,7
Lol. He is celebrating a wicket over a wide delivery which could have ended up as a boundary.,10
Fuck fuck fuck,4
MI gifted 2 fucking wickets to SRH,10
[deleted],4
Hope Kishan plays like he did against RCB. The Punjab game was frustrating to watch. We can't have both QDK and kishan struggling in Sharjah rn.,2
Mumbai Indians don't go through stats right? This is lowest score here in powerplay,3
"So the strategy is simple on this ground. Bowl shit deliveries, get wickets.",8
what's the music in that Benz ad?,3
Kock better score some rons today.,3
149 target and mi wins by 2 runs.,8
How much money does Flipkart have to hire big names for IPL ads? Why not give actual discounts instead?,6
Siddharth the great destroyer has summarily crushed and dismissed MI‚Äôs elite number 3 Yadav. I fear that none of the other batsman will be able to survive more than 3 balls against him.,15
Anyone watching match on tv live but just like to chat here on reddit?üòÇ,14
Khaleel would have celebrated that by running half way to Dubai,27
Whoever gave ideas for that lenskart ads is dangerous to be kept alive,16
Lowest powerplay score in Sharjah in this ipl,7
Ishan Kishan is so close to being a very satisfying name much like Sean Bean,10
2 wickets down within a powerplay üëè,6
"MI that kind of team who will get the lowest powerplay score at Sharjah, but the highest last 5 over score ever",8
"On a shit ground, with a shit pitch, you bowl shit balls to get wickets.",3
"Two left handers, anybody see williamson bowling",4
Should have sent Pandya,3
"Bc were comparing khaleel to Kaul forgot how he used to pick wickets. It's his first match,give him a break. Rabada was slaughtered yesterday, Margin for error is so small in this ground.so anyone can get hit, it's powerplay obviously Mi will hit 200 in this small ground.",8
"Don't ball on stumps, ball wide deliveries to our batsmen and we will do the rest.",5
"Feel like De Kock is going to lose his wicket to Rashid, he struggles against spin.",15
Both Kaul's delivery and Yadav's shot were horrible,13
"Come on cock, you need to perform for long today",3
Ishan Kishan in the u19 wasn't thicc but since then he seems to copied Rishabh Pant's game and thiccness,12
Should have sent pollard. His backfoot defense will be 6 here,7
"Cricbuzz: That's the lowest Powerplay score in Sharjah.


SRH Batsmen: Records are meant to be broken.",68
Samad out here looking like a dollar store yoyo honey singh,3
More and more googlies,2
Stop hitting wides you benchods,1
Samad with the glasses asserting dominance over the sun,7
QDK has always struggled against spin. I don't see him lasting for long with the kind of form he's in.,4
Wow guys! 50 in 6 overs. Task failed successfully!,3
"Siddharth Kaul ""I was bowling shit balls throughout my 1st over but he did not hit them to the fielder.""",4
"I am seeing 2 deKock.


DeKock is playing from each end?",1
Prove me wrong Quinton. Show us you can play spin.,3
Sneak in a couple of overs from Samad and Abhishek. Don't leave them for Pollard and Hardik.,5
Wtf 48-2??? Sometimes it sucks being an MI supporter,5
[removed],2
What I don't get is that the downvoter is downvoting MI fans criticising mi as well,5
Kaul looks as if he calculated that wicket,6
Warner wants to finish Samad off before Pandya and Pollard get in,7
Samad has that CHAD energy,1
De Kock under pressure to score here. Lynn lurking in the background,2
The fifth bowler has to be targeted,2
"SRH has so many Indian Fast bowlers
Bhuvi, Kaul, thampi, natrajan, khaleel",7
Samad got swag.,4
Come on let's get that 100 today Kishan,5
Bro I'm straight up not having a good time,5
De kock and de kock pro max at the crease,4
Should have sent Pollard vs the spinners man,2
"Quinnie get a 50 at least. That way we can at least say QuInNiE bAcK iN fOrM, after the game is lost.",4
AWH MAN,3
Very lucky,2
De Kock! You literally have me a heart attack! Phew!,2
"Parried over the bar

Great save from Pandey

Oh wait....wrong sport",7
MI playing with wrong approach of laying a platform for Pandya and Pollard.... everyone should attack,3
Mi shits the bed when no one expects them to.,5
Manish Manish oh Manish,3
Mumbai is struggling,1
No more Specialist Fielder‚Ñ¢,3
Pandey jii FFS,3
Unbelievable that Pandey has dropped 2 catches in consecutive games. He's got one of the safest pair of hands,5
"lol commentators 

you need good fielders at the boundary like Manish Pandey... 

Pandey: you were saying",6
3 drops for manish pandey in 3 games,6
"Commentator: Samad bowled well in last over against CSK.


Reality: 20 runs.",8
Manish too? Wtf,8
Thats the game for us,5
Has Manish Pandey's fielding declined?,4
What‚Äôs with Pandey and missing catches this season?!,4
Quinton century incoming,5
Pandey hasn't been near his best in the field this year,7
Manish Pandey dropped many catches last match too,7
Wtf happened to speciist fielder,2
Tactical Drop?,2
Ok boys time to sober Pandey,7
"*The ball barely leaves the batsman's bat*

Bairstow: CAAATCH!!",5
sPEciAlIsT FielDER,3
"Bro, covid has broken Manish pandey. What a gun fielder he used to be before covid.",8
Check Manish Pandey's Google Pay,8
Pandey dropping so many,7
How the fuck are people like manish pandey and jadeja dropping catches this often,7
Something happened with Manish.,3
Pollard v Rashid. What a match up to look forward to.,2
Incoming 'catches win matches',3
"Manish Pandey, specialist fielder, drops a catch and lets it go for 6.",8
"*You were the choosen one pandey Garu, why you do this*",4
You dun fucked Pandeyji.l,2
"Obligatory, FaF would've pocketed it.",7
An excellent over and it still goes for 11. Unlucky for Samad.,4
"So Pandey is either specialist Batsman or specialist fielder, just not both at the same time.",6
FFS Manish Pandey lost his best and only attribute.,7
"Rare things happening today 
- Sid Kaul getting a wicket 
- Manish Pandey dropping an easy catch (for a quality fielder like him its pretty easy)",10
Fingers pointing up,3
"Specialist fielder you say.. 

Go on Quinton!",2
SRH is actually a pretty decent team on paper. It is just that the big guns are not clicking.,7
Sharjah is famous for bookies. Not like Pandey is getting any ads or grade a contract :p,-2
"SRH‚Äôs got auch a young team say you

Tops worst fielding charts",-1
"They need to keep a tally of missed catches and embarrass the players, earning so much money and catch like club cricketers",0
Pander was too casual smh.,5
bring back the greatest headband-wearing bowler on the planet you coward,7
What we see often: Manish Pandey dropping catches and commentators saying you don't see that often,16
[deleted],-2
No no no keep Rashid for Pollard and Pandya,3
"Ishan, you said you will play Rashid carefully. Stick to it now",7
Lmaoo..MX Takatak is the Adibas of the short video world,6
[deleted],4
"Bold prediction, MI won't make it to 200 today.",12
Sharjah won't spare even Rashid,6
MI better hold on to their wickets here. SRH's death bowling is basically non existent,10
Bairstow needs to shut up with the Catch it every ball,5
"I'm straight up not having a good time, with jadeja and manish both dropping catches. 


HOWWWWW",12
Please don't go after Rashid. He would single handedly tear us a new one,4
"Who is the 4th best T20 fast bowler in India? (Assuming first 3 are Bumrah, Bhuvi and Saini)",3
Where is my boy Alzerri Joseph. Might need him today.,10
I don't actually get what function Kaul's headband serves?,0
I hope our batsmen are prepped for this pitch. Isn‚Äôt this our first match at Sharjah?,3
Lmaoo Rashid already started celebrating,-1
Fucks sake Quinny..,2
Ffs play Rashid's over properly,1
Why play those shots. Brain dead batting.,1
Hell bent on committing suicide,2
I saw a stat on one of cricbuzz or cricinfo which said that the SRH bowling has performed above par in matches where bhuvi hasn't played. Interesting to see it play out again.,1
De Kock has been so lucky lmao,1
He can't play spin normally. Big brain de kock goes for a reverse sweep against the best limited overs spinner. Smh,3
De Kock not playing well. Should have played Lynn today in such a small ground.,2
De Kock Reliance's employee of the year,2
Time to bring in the big N U T T rajan,2
dekock trying random button combos and failing,2
"Too slow , should have reached 100 by now, it's Sharjah",5
Give gloves to Kishan and this cock outta here ffs,0
Shit score for Sharjah,5
De Kock is just trying too hard,4
Lmao the lenskart ad..üòÇüòÇ,5
Nice kock,6
I have a feeling that QDK will play a big innings,4
The balls on this guy to toss his deliveries,4
Dekock not getting comfy here. Worrying,4
On a side note- I‚Äôm upvoting y‚Äôall‚Äôs so you‚Äôll keep posting. Are you?,10
Remember when Indian fans were claiming Rashid was overhyped and Kuldeep was the best wrist spinner in the world,11
You guys are watching the match while I am watching Samad's toned hammy hams üòçüòç,3
SHOT!!,5
Mumbai are at least 25 runs behind where they should be at this stage. But Pollard and Hardik combo could be the game changer.,7
For a moment I thought deCock would kick his own fucking wickets,3
When u can play shots like that why tf do you want to reverse sweep?,6
can he do that? kick the ball from the stumps?,4
[deleted],6
"Tossing it up here is just asking to be smashed

Have to bowl flat and hope the batsmen can't get it away",4
3 wicket keepers on the pitch,2
how pathetic must someone's life be to dedicate their Sunday to downvote comments in a match thread.,8
"Some of our were fans saying decock was our boi, doesn't seem like he is playing for us now , is it.",0
One more one more!!,1
"sharma is good bowler, he should bowl",1
Fucking sharjah. Srh's death bowling without bhuvi will get absolutely battered today,3
How is it a good idea to give a young batsman the bowl let alone a spinner,2
"Probably bairstow thinks all the fielders are equipped with jet pack, hate to break the truth to him",4
"If Abdul Samad ever pulls his hamstring, please GOD let me massage his thighs.",3
Well this would be Samad's final over but they still have Abhishek Sharma to bowl atleast 2 overs.,3
It's time we get decock's wicket.Dude will settle and probably hit a century.,3
"honestly, on this ground you have to play without the fear of being caught",2
Decock struggling today becoz of recent form. Hope he continues his innings today and finds that confidence back.,6
Warner will score a century on this anus sized ground.,13
Why are you wasting time to get this reviewed. Dumb,6
They doin a third umpire review for that...tf,5
Really? They had to check that??,8
I hate umpires reviewing even this. He was almost past the stumps there. Fucking hell,3
That was actually a pretty sick throw from Bairstow. Getting a hit from that angle is kinda cool.,8
Massive BDE from the cock here,3
Oh! That was so close!,4
Who appealed for that again?,5
Umpire what are you smoking? How are any of these good for nothing twats getting paid to stand and watch cricket?,1
We need third umpire for this - smh,2
"Useless square leg umpire, his kids needs a paternity test",0
Bairstow fast af boi,3
"His bat was past the stumps, why review that üòÇüòÇüòÇ",4
Blind umpires smh,3
Oh they were doing the third umpire thing,4
[deleted],2
Sunny G would have called out the umpire,5
Is the third umpire speaking from inside a fish tank?,6
I always love the runout reviews where the bat crosses the stumps before the ball hits,10
Why are they trying for 2s on Sharjah?? Braindead approach,0
Fine umpires for wasting time.,6
Why do they even pay the on field umpires if they just go to the third umpire for every fucking decision,6
"Sorry, as an unbiased SRH fan he clearly didn‚Äôt get back into his crease.",18
"Not conclusive, should've reviewed that footage again",10
De kock saale matke,3
Okay we got a competitor to kaul here,7
Bhai pandey ki fielding ko kuch ho gaya hai :(,9
Pandeyji's specialist fielder credentials to be revoked.,3
"Abe sale downvoter madarchodo, zindagi mein kuch accha karlo",7
At this point fielders should just stop appealing on obvious things because umpires are so shite appeal = referral,5
Manish Pandey is a good fielder my ass.,3
De Kock is too good a player to be out of form so long.. hell even King K came back to form yesterday,4
Check Pandey's PayTM now .,9
So 40% of the match fee from umpires then...?,6
pandey straight up not trying,6
Pandey ji kya haal hai,8
"Fuck me, Manish has gotten bad at the one thing he was good at.",7
"What do you call Quinton when he defends ?

'Kock Block'",14
We are 17 runs behind,2
Manish pandey get rid of the fucking hat,5
"Fuck off with these vuvuzela sounding audio clips. 

Argh.",7
Anything less than 220 is not safe here,7
Our fielding is garbage since last match,5
Only Rashid is overseas bowler today. Quinton reeeaaaally lover Indian bowlers.,8
[deleted],6
Addul Samad bringing De Kock in form single handedly,6
Dude Pandeys fielding fell hard,6
PayTM sponsorship coin achieved,5
Downvote boi has arrived,6
Imagine getting paid to say 'rock and roll' every 30 mins,10
MI's players are so confident. Even if they are 2 down they are not shaken up and going according to plans.,6
Imposter pandey,5
Quinny 'Indian Bowler Killer' Decock back hopefully,7
"Sachin Tendulkar: With 2 left-handers at the crease  
Rashid Khan‚Äôs role becomes very crucial.

[Tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/sachin_rt/status/1312705449205137408)",11
Theyre just straight up giving de Kock runs,7
[removed],5
Decock starting to look good now. He must really convert today into big innings. Crucila for MI now.,5
"How is Samad only 18, his build and receding hairline tells otherwise",6
single after a boundary may help sunny paaji climax but on sharjah it's just a wasted delivery,7
He is de kock,1
*Ye wautomatically hisaab kare*,1
Specialist Fielder‚Ñ¢ is just done with fielding and wants to bat already.,8
Pandey traded his fielding skills to bat better,10
Time for a Ad-money cash grab strategic time-out!,3
Fours where the batsman finds the gap are more impressive than sixes at this pathetic ground,9
Pandey rolled but his hat stayed put quite impressive ngl,10
"11 overs left out of which Rashid will bowl 3, Natarajan 2 and Sandeep 2.",3
Thala is going to hit 67 sixes in his first ball today,22
"friends talking about Mutual funds just before playing Fifa, totally realistic",23
"I am hoping to see 1 innings where both QdK and Rohit fire, and Pollard and Pandya produce a massive finish. Hopefully in the 2nd game against CSK which is also at Sharjah.",5
The mods should disable the live vote count on our match threads. That should discourage these cunts from mass downvoting. Football match threads do that.,9
Can we get a 200+ score?,3
What do u guys think is a good score here 300?,3
Absolute masterclass by this gentleman in the dugout. Hard to believe he played professional cricket once but yeah he looks domestic worthy atleast.,3
BCCI should splurge some money and hire few robots for next year's IPL. They will do much better than these jackass blind umpires..,2
Guy with 100 Cr net worth talking about mutual funds. Get fucked.,5
Awkward scenes in the dugout rn lmao,4
"I like Sunny G's blunt commentary, he is not afraid of criticizing anyone. But even he licks MSD's ass. I wished at least there were more honest Indian commentators.",2
Pandey's fielding stonks hit the ground,3

Fake crowd are always way out of time with the countdown,5
KANEYYYY,4
Kano,2
"5th bowler going at 13.5, and the remaining 4 full-time bowlers going at 7.5, I really hope teams realise that to minimise damage at the end in Sharjah you need to pick wickets up front. The  best way to do that is to play 5 full-time bowlers.",3
"Williamson bowling

I called it",5
"Feels bad man. We need a proper 5th bowler at Sharjah. Otherwise we are just going to feed them 15 runs per over. 

Nabi should have been taken into consideration. Or even Stanlake.",3
What? Killiamson bowling?,4
Kanoss,2
Lmao is Kane Willaimson going to bowl?,7
Pandey exchanged his batting for fielding skills. An equivalent exchange.,1
Oh williamson!?,2
Abhinav mukund is probably the best Indian analyst in the Dugout . He has good chemistry with the other commentators.,3
How tf is CSK at the top of FairPlay ?,3
Haha. Kane Williamdharan to bowl!! We're witnessing greatness here.,3
We are last on fair play award? What did we ever do to umpires.,4
Yooooo lmfao Williamson balling!,3

"Williamson is gonna take a wicket. There, I said it.",7
What's happening?,2
"Wait, what the fuck?",1
"I said it in the last match will say it again, Bairstow is a shit keeper",5
kane's been on screen less than 2 sec and someone said gentleman already,6
"Warner if you don't bowl the next over, give the captaincy to Williamson.",6
What did CSK do to be on the top of fair play lol? Submit their OTP on time?,11
All aboard the Kane train fellows. It's time,7
KANOS GOLDEN ARM,7
"Kanos to bowl, now this game is perfectly balanced, as all things should be",6
Hope he doesn't fall flat on his face like Viral Kilo...,3
Bruh is the cameraman drunk,7
*Murali is proud of our prime spinner Kane*,16
Inject those Kanos dodgy off breaks right into my veins,7
Kanos!!!! Wow,6
Now what‚Äôs koach‚Äôs excuse?,7

Asking Murli about legality of Kane's action lmao,10
Yay go Kanos,4
The smiling assassin :'),3
Shitty ass camerawork,4
Excuee,2
"Fuck cricket!

Big Boss Season 14 about to start boys! Main event of 2020 fo sho!",6
5 runs in 4 balls is brilliant,2
Everyone gets to bowl today.,2
"Well, we're going to lose this match anyway, might as well try out Kanos' bowling",9
Lmao the batsmen really be seeing off Kanos,6
Murali always comes across as a jolly fellow,8
better economy than kaul,5
Lol that cameraworküòÇüòÇ,4
"Lmao look at Murli's face! Basically signaling, ' I will still go for less runs than Kano and Samad on this ground, I told David to go for 2 proper spinners today'",10
"kanos eco = rashid eco

kanos bowling = rashid bowling",9
Imagine participating in Series Z funding and paying $100m so that the company can use that money to sponsor fair play award,15
Kano bowling well.,14
He's prob bowling bcuz of the 2 lefties I feel,6
Kane bowling better than Kaul lmao,19
[removed],11
Watching Murali is so wholesome,31
KANE üòç,9
He‚Äôs chucking lol,10
Abhishek: guess I'll fo,8
Just a reminder that Kanos has over 70 international wickets at a relatively decent average. If not for his dodgy action I imagine he would have more.,29
The world is NOT ready for Murali‚Äôs disciple Kane.,33
Rashid who? Make way for Kane,9
"Kanos : Fine, I'll do it myself.",14
Fuck that was a tidy over from Kanos.,7
"Who is this guy being interviewed rn?

Show us the cricket lol. Don't show us an interview of a nobody.",-9
If Kane keeps bowling that could be really good for our WT20 balance.,8
What a neat over,4
Murali has taught Kane his secrets,10
Good over so far,4
Great over only 7 runs,6
Murali Prodigy üòçüòçüòç,4
Kane actually bowled well. Gamble paid off.,7
King Kanos with a better economy than Rashid,4
"It‚Äôs amazing to see Murali on screen again, he looks so happy and his English is amazing now!",4
Decent over. Is there anything this man can't do?,3
Is there any guy in SRH who isn't a wow bowler,3
How is goswami as a batsman compared to Pandey?,2
Pretty good over,4
Bairstow chutiya shouting catch even on ground shots,5
Muraliamson had an excellent over. Brilliant!,4
"Friendship with Nabi over
Kanos my new best friend",11
holy fuck he gave just 7 lmfao,9
[removed],14
Waiting for Rohit Sharma to bowl and take another hattrick.,26
mfs couldnt even hit a boundary off Kane,8
fucking hell they are letting Kane get away with 7 runs,7
Batsmen were so smitten by Kanos charisma and forgot they're playing in Sharjah.,29
Very decent over from Kanos,16
"Kane, is there anything he can't do?",6
MI also respecting Kanos by not trying for boundaries off him.,30
Petition to make Kane the 5th bowler,5
De Kock is jealous of majestic beard Kane is sporting.,10
Kanos' action looks like he's about to interrupt himselves and redo the ball,5
"Kane bowled the equivalent of a maiden, dafaq are these two doing",13
Muralitharan is such a sweetie. Always smiling and happy. üòÄ,10
Are there no Sri Lankans in IPL this year?,6
Even MI batsmen showing respect to kanos,7
Murali is just the Sri Lankan Williamson.,33
"If MI retains this partnership for longer, they will be well set for a huge total with Pollard and Hardik going berserk",5
"Rashid today: 1-0-8-0

Kanos: 1-0-7-0

Kanos > Rashid",19
love it when they give these part-time bowlers an over or two,8
The collective jizz of r/cricket causes a tissue shortage,20
"Kanos bowls a decent over , some hardcore simping incoming",17
It's like bowling Muralitharan and Shane Warne in tandem,8
MI frustrated that they couldn‚Äôt score of Kanos Will now go after Rashid and lose a wicket,5
You know things are desperate when we saved 3 overs of Rashid Khan for the last 10 overs and Williamson is brought into cover some overs.,6
Part timers doing better than the full timers today,6
[removed],8
"Well done Rashid, giving 100% like always. Pick-up a wicket now pls",3
DC were 89/1 after 10. MI still have Polly Hardik left,7
When Kane‚Äôs first over was more economical than Rashid‚Äôs first over,6
Kanos>YRKFA,2
15 runs an over needed now?,4
So iOS users can't play fantasy cricket right?,3
Shame they won't interview Murali in Tamil. I'll bet he would've been much more articulate.,10
"Is Kane chucking again?

He is like Hafeez - chucks, gets banned, corrects his action and chucks again,  repeat",11
I‚Äôm not sure about T20 but Ishan‚Äôs a bright prospect for test cricket.,9
Kishan has totally struggled after that 99. If not for that dropped catch that went for a 6 his innings would look even worse,3
'Bacche ko bachao' is my favourite ad.,8
Imagine Kane taking a wicket... This sub will get collective orgasam,45
Shitty batting,3
"Fuck YRKFA

All my boys love OKWFNZ",6
"kishan : "" i wont get carried by six hitting in sharjah""

also kishan: i will make 10(10) with only 1 four

ITS A JOKE PEOPLE, I KNOW KISHAN IS OP",9
[I hope VVS treats Holder better than what he did to Sammy](https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/darren-sammy-srh-racism-vvs-laxman-remember-dark-kalu-6455170/),2
Even MI batsmen are simping over Muraliamson.,8
Looks like downvoter committed sudoku.,13
Rashid dived in front of the non striker twice now. This time there was no chance to field it anyway,6
"Kanos >> Rashid, Narine",1
Why is Warner not bowling Abhishek Sharma?,5
Is Rashid popular in Afganistan?,12
"Rashid going for 4 run overs even in sharjah, That's some class right there",7
bring in kaul for a moral boost pls,6
Why doesn't Swiggy sponsor SRH?,2
"Good bowling Rashid, continuing what kanos taught you. Now rest, while kane takes two wickets and breaks MI moment",14
Less than 210 would be really tough for MI bowlers on this pitch as they don't have a spinner like Rashid.,8
Warner garu also needs to think about throwing some bowls.,8
"Strength for SRH is dot balls, but MI has been doing a decent job rotating strike.",3
"Holy shit if that gave in a wicket, I'd have died",5
Gotta apologize Pant for yesterday's match. Johnny is way worse on stumps mic.,7
Memebai can't figure out this out of syllabus bowling!,13
"""Kishan has struggled after 99""
 just stop this us his second match after that.",4
The chucker is bowling wow,1
Why is abhishek not bowling?,3
Kanos going for a 2nd,2
Idk action looks ok to me,2
warner isn't risking another Kaul over,3
"Kane: *bowls

Rohit 'hat-trick' Sharma: Are you challenging me?",7
Get Warner to bowl next you cowards,7
"Good bowling kane, remove de cock",5
Another from kaney??,3
Kishan's gotta go after Kane now. Can't allow a part timer to feel comfortable in a small ground. But also gotta be smart about it though. Can't lose a wicket to part timer either.,3
This means vadapav will have to bowl later right,2
Camera work is sloppy today.,6
Take that simps!!!,4
Man i was hoping for 250 runs today from MI...my next hope is RCB bowling now to pass the 250 mark at Sharjah,2
With TV9 advertising on RR I'm surprised there's no Sun Network stuff on the SRH Jersey.,2
QDK needs to hit or get out,0
Feel bad for kisan,0
oh geez it was going well for kane,2
Warner became too greedy with Kanos bowling,7
Go home cameraman you are drunk! Camerawork has been dogshit this game.,4
QDK iS bAcK iN fOrM,3
Camera manüòÜ,5
We asked for this,4
Fucking fire this shit camera man,10
Don't worry kane we still love you,3
Terrible camerawork,6
I don‚Äôt know how warner didn‚Äôt see this coming!,7
Ishan is inspired by Lord Tewatia,1
Only Surya and Krunal left now to get decent form.,3
Warner back into the I no longer give a fuck mode like it's 09 all over again.,1
kock teases every fucking 6-7 deliveries then goes onto old antics again,3
[deleted],6
Can someone tell Sanjay the diff bw de cock and Kishan,8
We need to get to 230. I'm scared of what Warner would do to us on this ground.,10
Good to see de Kock going hard,5
"BOWL

BAIRSTOW

YOU

CUCKS",37
QDK fluked that 50. Dropped once and then saved by his leg,1
Why give the second over tho?,9
We have to realize how tough it is to bat in the heat,8
Ruining best bowler's figures smh,9
We might see 250 today,2
No Smash Williamson,5
That's bad Kanos,3
"Oh no, Kane",4
Bowling Kane was a bad joke.,4
It was good while it lasted friends.,10
Lmao! Yup that'll be end of kanos...,6
Warner got greedy,6
It's so difficult to bowl to these guys.,5
Warner should've taken the win with the first over he got out of Kanos,8
We're fucked bois,4
It's not a surprise if you do it twice.,3
"His 50 was confirmed the second Pandey parried that catch for 6.

Go on Quinny! Make it a big one.",6
It's official kano has an economy of 7 in T20s at Sharjah,7
Warner finding reasons to drop KW.,11
Smart move. Don't hit Kanos in the first over so he gets a second one,12
Great shot by decock. A good fifty overall.,1
SRH fifth bowler: 4 overs for 51 runs.,3
"I think Kishan is struggling physically since the RCB innings, affecting his batting",-1
23 from 2 is not bad considering Kanos is not even a part timer,4
"Ishan Kishan is apparently ""struggling"" with his 15 off 14. This sub wants nothing less than six off every ball to not shit on any batsman. Calm your fucking tits guys.",11
Sexy fifty from the cock,4
250 is my score prediction,0
aw fuck its all over now,3
Ask Bairstow to bowl. I just can't bear him behind the stumps.,8
Gamble doesn't pay off twice. 2 sixes off the over.,3
Did they hire new cameraman or something? Camera ball tracking is fucking horrible.,6
Dude I know 200 is a standard on this pitch but it pains to see SRH being hit around,8
It would take a miracle to keep them under 200,6
"WTF De Cock just drank out of the same bottle as Kishan

are they that close",6
These two have batted well. Common sense batting at 8-9 rpo+ and setting the perfect platform for Pollard and Hardik.,6
"Out of all William‚Äôs children, kane is still the best son",6
Oh my God not kaul again,3
Kaul is here to force a brain fade from the batsman,5
why kaul ?,2
"Leg spinner, left handed batsman, bad idea.",3
Oh god,2
"The jio dhan dhana dhan is so fucking cringy, makes me wanna tear my fucking eyes out",6
Kaul baba,2
Now that QDK has got his eye in he should just throw everything at the ball. Personal glory be damned,1
Has no one ever noticed that Kane Williamson and Pewdiepie look similar with the beard?,8
When exactly did Sid Kaul shot to fame?,-1
"This sub struggles with the idea of getting your eye in 

yesterday they were shitting on Iyer",3
Can‚Äôt wait to bench Kaul next game,2
Warner: When the batsman are hitting sixes why not give an over to kaul,2
Who dropped the nuke? Why that siren?,7
No ball free hit!,1
Cho ball,1
Kishan and deKock drinking from the same bottle!!! Where is bio bubble?,2
Oh ffs Kaul,2
Great partnership so far between Kiss on De Cock,7
"Oh wow kaul
Really?",2
That's a big no-ball,1
Check Kaul's pAyTm,1
"Oh ffs, just shoot me.",1
"Another Kaul over?!? 
My body is not ready for it",2
"Wow, they are already tired. The heat is brutal here",1
Come on Quinton! You need to deposit those in the stands.,1
Can y‚Äôall take a chill pill blaming bowlers. Most bowlers in that situation would have been hit regardless of who bowled it,3
Fuck me in the ass this is just disgraceful bowling,5
Kaul feels he's not giving enough runs,4
Can they atleast not give extras and drop catches ?,2
Thank u kaul but its time to sitout,2
Kaul baba said no ball it shall be,1
Imagine not getting a boundary on a free hit in sharjah,3
QDK finally did it.,3
Agent Kaul,1
"not sure what‚Äôs worse from Kaul, his hairline or his bowling",2
Thank you de Kock‚ù§Ô∏è,3
Siddharth knows he won‚Äôt get a 4th over so he has decided to bowl a few extra deliveries. Bless him.,8
Kaul will surprise everyone and take a wicket with his slower ones.,2
"Batsmen plays any shot, and Bairstow be like, ""Catch!""",7
sneaky quinton,1
Come on how is that shot even legal üòÇ,1
Fucking kaul. Replaces srh's best bowler and does this shit,3
This is why it is fucked up to have only 4 proper bowlers. Because you can‚Äôt expect all 4 of them to perform. One of them is bound to fuck up.,2
Toying around with kaul,1
Looking at Pandya's Tattoos I can't help but think he's lost quite a few bets,4
Got up at 6 to see this shit bowling,2
My man kaul be running from narnia only to be picked by for a boundary,2
"Kaul, you need the orange cap

‚ÄòJust guve me 3 overs‚Äô",2
"New to cricket, why doesn't Kishan retire out so that Lovely Trenty can whack a few out of the park??",5
Shit kaul,2
Qdk is playing at 171 strike rate. It is not bad.,5
"Just how much money did Kaul have on MI over 202.5 runs? 

Dude is diabolical so far lol",1
"Alright, RR close to 10 now. 

Pollard next. Boom Boom baam",3
QDK happily repaying SRH for his return to form,5
What's wrong with the camera work this game? Not even following the ball properly,7
Why is he wearing a band??? I mean seriously?,2
kaul is the imposter guys,4
Every out of form batsmen is desperate to play at Sharjah.,3
Valiant effort from YRKFA,2
Khaleel in the AC changing room laughing and thanking God he was dropped today,15
Post 50 de kock is the best cock,6
"I give Kane another instead of Kaul‚Äôs last, unironically. At least Kane had one economical over and does well vs the left hander",2
Quinny looks set now. I can see a potential 100 brewing,2
Two clones batting,1
Kaul aims a bouncer but gets a yorker,10
"If I am Kaul at this point in gully cricket I would say my mom is calling me , I have to go",14
I'm just worried we have to bowl Sandeep Sharma later,1
Kaul is such a village bowler,4
We legit just begging them to make 240+,2
"Kaul might as well break the most runs given award, and I'm not even kidding",3
Man this ground is stupid,2
"I'm not worried about our bowling tbh. This a shitty ground to bowl on and to defeat an opponent, you've to out bat the opposition. I'm just waiting to see how our batsmen do here.",3
i actually feel bad for him,6
"take back the banter, this fucking dreadful bowling",5
Qdk actually Played for SRH as a 19 year old,7
"Hyderabad fans, what do you think will be the target? Seriously asking",3
"Fastest half century,",1
I'd rather bowl Williamson for an over instead of kaul,3
"Kaul's hair is in such a pitiful state, Amit Mishra might try to convert him on the ground

and get in trouble like Ahmed Shehzad trying to convert Dilshan",6
I don‚Äôt think Kaul will play another game this IPL.,4
Mumbai.mp3,2
Century loading from decock,2
Did Siddarth age 10 years from 2019 to 2020,23
Lmao kaul doesn't need 4 overs to complete his 50,7
"I mean, maybe Kane was the better option after all.",7
Why does Manish Pandey look like he's running outwards towards the boundary on the shortest ground?,3
Kaul looks like he's being forced to play,5
Fuck it have YJB bowl and kaul keep,8
Hehe boi.,2
Warner wanted shitty bowlers out of the way before the death. But who is laughing now,3
We need bairstow to play a de kock type innings today. Ironically he has been out of sorts too,3
Sharjah is a basically a pick me up opportunity for batsmen in a rut,12
Kaul/Unadkat type of bowlers are the worst for these kind of pitches,3
Ishan's dive game has been on point tho in all 3 games he's played in,8
"Warner to Kaul: Mate, DJ won't play Telugu songs until you take a wicket.",19
"Warner speaking to Kaul: Bro, the wickets are right there bro. Please stay away from the boundaries",9
You can do it Kaul! Get another fifty today!,0
"4 overs for 51 from the 5th bowler combination, and doesn't look like they will be the worst for the day",2
Kaul on his way to a fifty!!,6
De Kock is penetrating right now hahaha,3
Can Bhuvi return by disguising himself with that awful headband,8
Why would you choose to bat when it will get cooler in the evening making the chase easier.,2
Kishan should strike every ball now,1
De Kock looks roasted medium rare,3
Kishan needs to start pushing. MI has power hitters waiting in the dugout.,2
Kaul century incoming ‚ô•Ô∏è,3
"With Hardick and Pollard waiting, Kishan needs to swing at every ball",6
I lowkey feel bad for him,1
Kaul suss,1
Oh boy where is the sandpaper when you need it,10
I want the ads continue through kaul‚Äôs over,3
"Feeling kinda bad for Saurabh Tiwary, he was in good form",5
Spinner bowling to Hardik on this ground is Seppukku,10
RASHIIIID!!,6
Thank you Kock,6
Shitttt,1
Rashid is literally the GOAT!,4
Man Rashid is amazing!,1
id say it KARAAMAATI KHAAANNN,2
Wtf was that Rashid?,2
Styris just said we will not be taking De Kock this match anymore LMAO,5
Rashid ain't waiting for Manish to drop these,7
RASHID YOU BEAUTY,5
You just can't hit rashid,2
Av it Rash,1
"Yess baby, funck finally",1
No quinnie!,2
Rashid caught de cock,1
LETTTS GOOO,2

Cock falls 2 short of 69,7

That was superb from Rashid .,3

No ):,5
Yess de cock take that,-1

Fuckboi next,1

"""We won't be taking the cock anymore in the game"" - Scott Styris lmfaoo",5
"While our bowling have not been on point, clearly this ground is not fit to host T20s. 

It is painful to have such grounds.",8
Ishan Lashan needs to fire now.,2
Pollard or hardick next?,1
Rashid the bowler is back,2
Rashid my man,2
The cock went limp,2
De cock really shagged us didn't he,2
Sid Kaul's talent was stashed in his hair...,4
Ishu Kishu out hota to chalta. Anyways decent inning by Kock,2
De Kock lofted and Rashid holds it.,2
Thank god he didn't drop the catch otherwise Sunny G would've started preaching his FiNgeRs pOinTinG tHe SkY theory,3
"After that pandey drop, Rashid : fine I will do it myself",5
QDK fails pulling the ball again. Being from Saffa bouncy pitches one would think he has a good pull,0
Now I'm terrified of being spanked by HardDick and daddy Pollard.,2
aight Rolly Polly time,3
"Lol, Rashid is like fuck it I'll catch it myself",5
Did he just say we'd not be taking de cock in the match lol?,2
He made a difficult catch look easy,6
Pandya timeeeee,3
That's 10 years of experience from Rashid!!,11
We know what‚Äôs the target for Pandey now,7
"**13.1** Rashid Khan to de Kock, OUT,  **126-3**

Q de Kock c &amp; b Rashid Khan 67 (39b 4x4 4x6) SR: 171.79",0
Save that next Rashid over for Pollard.,5
De Kock looked tired anyway. Probably for the best.,4
Every bowler should know by now that headbands are bowlers' kryptonite. Amateur move by Kaul.,6
""" We'd be not taking DeKock anymore""- Scott Styris.




üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠üò≠",9
Fuckboi time,2
Rashid gets QdK yaay,3
No bowler except Mishra is gonna drop a catch off their own bowling,5
Camera work has been shitty thiugh,2
I honestly can't understand SRH fans. They are either too dumb or are just jinxing MI. MI is scoring below the par on this ground. Anything less than 220 is absolutely chaseable,3
Amitabh Bachchan playing young guy and old guy while being old is one of the worst views in my life.,2
[deleted],1
Bairstow better deliver today. We could've got a foreign bowler instead of kaul,3
wtf is this CEAT abomination,2
Rashid‚ÄîRashid‚ÄîRashid,2

The young Rashid Khan from Afghanistan finally got de Cock.,2

De cock went to let hard dick in,1
They are not stopping,3
Kishan has balls,1
Does Hardik has better record against Rashid than Pollard? Why he is send earlier? Doesn't make much difference though,2
Perfect time for Pollard hope Rashid gets smashed before picking his wicket.,2
I am always scared when we play a shot against Rashid. He a scary af,3
I'm expecting big dick energy from Pandya today.,3
Shut the hell up Slater and Murali,1

74m and that's not even a close boundary six. What the fuck kind of ground is this,3
Wtf is this cameraman doing!,2
BAIRSTOW AND WARNER BETTER FIRE TODAY MANNN,3
"You have got a six, play sensibly...no blind swinging",1
Camera man,3
Shitty camera work today,3
Haha camera man is watching pornüòÜ,3
What is this camerawork? Where‚Äôs the ball?,3
"QdK batted well and still people complaining about it. Classic r/cricket. 

He did his job and did it well after a scratchy start and capitalised on some luck. Well done",20
That requires some serious guts to hit a six after your partner departs,2
Key moment for quinton's to go down. Must have made 75 atleast. But I guess that's what Rashid is for. Getting set guys out.,0
God the camera man is terrible. Ball tracking is absolutely awful,7
Please hardik. No funny business. See him off,3
What the fuck is this camera work?,8
What the fuck is this camera work!,2
"This is very good stuff from MI. 200 is safe, 250 is wjat MI are targetting",1
Camera work is just atrocious today,1
I'm waiting for someone to make a fantastic 'emergency meeting' meme about ceat Tyres strategic timeout. Come on guys make it happen.,6
the cameraman had too much to drink,4
Shitty camerawork,6
Lmfao someone downvoted the CricketMatchBot,11
Cameraman losing the ball again and again,10
The cameraman is having a worse day than kaul,21
Play out this over hardicc!,1
Fuck this camera man bc blind asshole,7
Cameraman tripping on acid today,13
Get Pollard and Hardik quickly and we back in game boissss,5
"Cant blame the cameramen, he doesnt have any girls to focus on",13
Imagine if kaul comes back for another over and gets hardik,8
"Good shot Kishan, but completely brainless to try that the next delivery after a wicket to the best bowler.",0
"Hardik, why play defense. Focus on your atrengths",1
MI could do better with the run rate,4
"Half the comments: dick jokes 

Other half: kill the cameraman",11
"Last 6 overs I think MI gets 100, 234/5 my prediction",3
Wow someone took the timeout early,3
Somebody gonna get fired today for camera work.,5
Camera doing a Kaul lmao,1
The camerawork has been awful today.,5
"Hey,can anybody explain that Dhawan Dream 11 ad?",1
Is it me or has the fielding standards really dropped all around the tournament,6
That one over from Rashid is all I am worried about right now.,4
Ishan‚Äôs hitting the ball so quick that the cameraman somehow can‚Äôt focus on the ball.,4
"this is the first match the camerawork has been shit, either it's too hot or too drunk",1
Hardik trying to defend is pure classic for a good long laugh. LMAO,6
"Man, i need a CEAT tyres strategic timeout in my life",21
"Abe yaar why can't it just be ""Strategic Timeout"", why does it have to be cEaT‚Ñ¢ sTrAtEgIc tImEoUT",1
Guys I just joined. I was told MI would get 300 today. Are they on their way?,5
Cameraman is drunk today,3
Hoped cameraman was as good spotting ball as they do with girls pathetic,11
Are we on course for 264?,3
Did you know that this CEAT Tires strategic CEAT Tires time-out is brought to us by CEAT Tires?,6
There‚Äôs something so intensely attractive about Rashid I can‚Äôt quite pinpoint,13
"134 with 6 overs to go with Pollard, Pandya Bros and Kishan. If MI is kept under 210, it's a win for SRH.",6
Strategic timeout.....for the Cameraman!,5
"Mann.. who let the intern take over the camera work? 

You're blowing your big break kid.",4
Hardick trying to play like dravid when he actually playes like stuart binny,4
If target stays under 200 SRH bowlers have done well honestly considering this pitch and size of ground,1
"no woman in the stands for the cameraman to point to, he's losing control",12
What is the first innings average?,3
250 is still on,-4
The cameramen probably working from home,6
Kaul back noooooo,-4
"300 very gettable from here, par for Sharjah tbh 

/s",0
"If I see that Gillette ‚ÄúDone‚Äù ad once more, I‚Äôm going to spontaneously combust.",2
Who's gonna bowl that 1 over? Warner?,1
Y'all sleeping on yorker king Natarajan,1
Lol the countdown audio isn't even synchronised,3
Hardik s out this over,1
Letszoooooooo,1
This Sharjah has done wonders for the confidence of men,2

I have a bad feeling we might collapse,1
"Two from Sandeep and Natarajan, one from Rashid, someone's gotta slip in that one overüò¨üò¨",1
"MI scored 100 in 6 overs in Dubai... but that was up to KL's bad planning. 

We are at Sharjah here. If SRH can get away with an 80, they would consider themselves lucky.",2

Sunrisers Parry over the boundary Hyderabad,1
Pandey sucking so much at fielding today,2
Pandey has been totally lackluster in the field today,1
Definitely buying an Altroz as soon as this game finishes,4
Pandey is better than this,1
To be fair that was a hard one,1
What is happening? QDK makes it look so simple.,1
David Warner wants to be like Kohli so much he's resorted to dropping opponent batsmen.,1
"Warner is now officially an Indian, an overseas spot opened up for SRH",1
I don't understand why Sandeep Sharma fails to make into IND XI,1
Wavid Darner,1
Why Pandey Why?,1
these midfields though,1
"It was a difficult catch, ffs, he jumped on the line",2
Fielding is god awful. Pandey what are you even doing,3
Faf would have caught that,2
The fielding has been so bad smh,2
Please smash that car.,1
Damn even commentators are going at Pandey ji,3
"There goes the match. How can we expect to win the match if don't catch , field like crap. Now in covers and deep misfields",3

That catch won‚Äôt get the respect it deserves.,2
Need at least 80 more. Oof,1
Pandey you absolute beauty!!,4
Please guys just get to 210 so I can breathe easy,1
Pandey doesn't want shitty catches,3
Was about to diss Pandey for his fielding today. Almost had to eat my own words,5
Lmao dropping hardik and catching Ishan. Now Pollard and Hardik gonna rekt srh,3
What a catch,5
Pandey back in style.,3
Shoulda dropped that to keep Pollard out,3
Now comes big man Polly,3
"**14.6** Sandeep Sharma to Ishan Kishan, OUT,  **147-4**

Probably for the best. Only time will tell though.,1
Pandey to r/cricket : talk nah,1
Pandey sir Pandey anthe,5
Murali Karthik talking about performance standards is pretty hilarious,2
Might be the best catch this Ipl,4
FUck off assholes! Pandey took a similar catch in Ranji Final vs Mumbai all those years back. Respect my boi!!,7
pandey is back,4
Manish: yeah r/cricket talk nah,7
Damn porn day ji,6
Oh damn I was about to shit Pandey before that catch,3

Wtf I just checked. Looks like I took Krunal Pandya instead of Hardicc in my Dream XI by mistake,24
Specialist Fielder‚Ñ¢ is back on form,3
12 runs an over gets us to 200+,1
Pandey took a similar catch for Karnataka against Mumbai in a Ranji final many seasons ago. It was a bit more difficult than this and I still rate that as the best catch I have ever watched.,2
Pandya and Pollard at Sarjah... Sweating intestifies...,5
We needed Ishan tbh,2
"Never doubted pandeyji

Hastily deletes old comments shitting on the greatest fielder of all time.",4
"Did this remind anyone of the day 2 lagaan catch 
Pandey was like fuck r/cricket",2
That catch was spectacular,5
Keep Kaul for the end. Use your key bowlers like Natarajan and Rashid to pick up the wickets.,2
Are they playing at sharjah,3
Rashid's last over should be interesting,1
Hardik looks like a soft dick in front of Pollard,2
Should have dropped it. Get ready for Pollard to get the fastest 100 ever in the IPL,1
These two at the crease with 5 overs in hand. What do you guys predict?,1
"They'll just play out Rashid, will go after the 16th over",3
Polly kaaka 2,1
The balls to have a slip in Sharjah,3
247 incoming?,1
Do not attempt in this over.,3

Rashid vs pollard. Lets go bois,1
73 runs off the next 30 balls somehow,1
Thala would have sent himself here,1
That's more like the Manish I know,2
5 overs of hardik and pollard makes me sweaty ngl,3
So 100 more for 247,3
Who‚Äôs gonna bowl the 4th over of the 5th bowler,1
"These two will slaughter our bowlers, RIP next four bowlers.",2
MS Pandya,5
Atleast take singles Pandya. Seeing off doesn't mean giving 2-3 dots in the death,3
"I'm here to watch one man and one man only, Thangarasu Natarajan!!!",4
yo pls hold back in this over,1
r/cricket: Perhaps I treated you too harshly,5
"what happened to the rule that the outgoing and incoming batsman need to cross each other within the boundaries? Seen lots of exception this ipl, just like Pollard/Kishan.",2
Why aren't they bowling abhishek? What am I missing?,1
Manish Superman Pandey!,1
So pandya and pollard know there‚Äôs a 4th over of the 5th bowler,1
Mumbai falling short of 200 will make this an interesting match,5
"That was SuperManish, as usual",7
That replay of the catch reminds me of Lagaan,3
"Mohammed ""Sirf second innings main wickets loonga"" Shami.

Manish ""Sirf hard catches loonga"" Pandey.",7
"Man, Rashid has so much burden to bear.",5
"Slip to Polly at this stage, Warner Anna, what r u planning?",4
60 runs in 3 overs is cake  if these two get going,2
"Pandya and pillar in at 15 overs at sharjah.

250 incoming",1
Slats under the pump.,1
We‚Äôve lost wickets at such crucial junctures :/. We should‚Äôve made 230 against this SRH bowling,1
Get ready for Pollard's back foot flicks going for sixes,4
Yup there goes MI's chances of reaching 200,3
Fuck me Rashid is god,3

Ah Frontfoot defence.,3
"For all his power,Russell would have tried to hit Rashid in this situation and got out in the process",1
89 of 4 incoming,2
"Remember, Steve Smith's comments work both ways. Just as you can play ""too aggressively"" on a big ground, you can play too conservatively on a small ground. I hope Warner doesn't end up making that excuse in the second innings.",3
There is no way they don‚Äôt get 200,2
Rashid is at a totally different level.,2
Pollard: yeah I'm the chanderpaul now,7
Dhoni getting inspired.,4
Fuck me Rashid is sooo good,2
In awe at the size of this lad,1
Should have played Nabi today.,2

"Wow pussies for not taking on Rashid or ""safe and intelligent"".",3
"If SRH had tk retain only one player, i know who they are gonna retain",3

Safely playing Rashid out and targeting the other bowlers is perfectly fine

And right on cue, Hardik smashes one for 6",3

Length is bread and butter for hardik,1
Somebody should show this to Pant. That's how you play out the main threat of the opposing team,3

If Nattu bowl less than 15 rpo in these two overs it's good in my book,2

"Excellent bowling nattu, you Beauty. What a comeback",2
Can't complain. That's great death bowling,5
I'd say pretty good over from Nattu.,8
Nattu my boy well done,6
Scenes if they miss out on 200.,4
Bowling Nattuuu,3
Remember that one match where Alzari Joseph brutally screwed us before disappearing into the night?,3
Good over at this stage even with the six,2
Awesome bowling from Natarajan,2
predict target ? how much will MI score ? Reply !,0
I like the belligerent aura that Pollard brings to the crease.,2
Feels like that 1 over will go for 20 to 30 runs minimum.,1
Damn. Great come back from Natarajan.,6
Pollard waiting for Gowtham to start hitting.,3
Hey what happened to the Deccan chargers,2
"Commentators raising a decent point here

Pretty much everyone puts their fielders on the edge of the ring and gifts ones

Might it be worth bringing them in a few yards to save one and put some pressure on the batsmen?",3
I am worried for that Kaul overüòÖ,3
big dick energy radiating from nattu,3
This guy should play for India. Such consistency with the yorkers.,5
Nattu what a death Bowler He is turning out to be,6
[removed],4
Any score less than 200 is not safe against ultimate FTB Warner.,2
"Damn Natarajan was great after that first ball 
 
Hopefully they smash the next bowler",3
It will be so MI to get a low total and fucking defend it,5
"4 yorkers, that was a great over.",6
MI Supporters to Pollard: Kab khoon khaulega tera?,5
YRKFA full form?,7
"This is Thala Combinatorics from MI here.,,",3
"What‚Äôs more orgasmic for Sunny G, Sunny leone or single after a six?",13
So fucking happy for Nattu ;') Fucking Csk get these players ffs üò≠,1
Oh shit kaul has an over left after this......,8
That was some good stuff by Natarajan! Want him to continue like this and he will achieve a lot of success,2
4 sixes this over,3
Damn full toss,3
This is the over boys,2
Lol Pollards flick went for 6,2
will kaul bowl the 20th over ?,2
3 overs 50 is just 210 Srh should be happy,1
What a sexy big dick SIX,1
The problem with SRH is that they have no bowler who can bowl over 140,5
"That last wide yorker was perfection. Natarajan is 29 years old. Where on earth was he in 2015 when we were playing clowns like Mohit Sharma? If he had access to the resources that Indian team players had, he might have been able to increase his pace a bit more.",53
100 sixes in Sharjah in 2020 IPL,4
Nattu Saini > Umesh in LoIS Chahar Shardul,3
LOL. Missed yorker.,2
Bowling full tosses to Pollard at Sharjah ü•¥,7
I wouldn't be surprised if we see 6 sixes in an over this innings,2
"Sandeep changed his action in this over, bowling differently now.",3
What is with Pollard‚Äôs bat?,2
"Neither, it's grounding the bat when running runs",0
"Pollard feast on spinners, not so much on fast bowlers.",2
Nattu is the new Bhuvi,3
Why did Sandeep lose all that pace? Injuries?,3
[deleted],6
Rashid is gun fielder,1
Pandya loves going deep.,2
"Loook at Natrajan numbers, geez",3
Why is Sandeep action weird,3
Hardik hasn't hit last year's form till now.,2
These lads arent gettin 200 lol,3
But below par for Mumbai so far.,2
Can clear full tosses üôÑ,1
"Pies, absolute pies.",1
What about these just enough sixes?,1
Stop bowling full toss to Pollard you twats lol,1
No full tosses please!!!!!,2
60 off the last three,1
"How many more full tosses?
Sandeep : Yes.",3
DON'T BOWL FULL TOSSES TO THIS MAN,1
Stop bowling full tosses you cuck,1
Wtf Sandeep bowling pies,2
They never learn do they,1
Pandey would have caught that..,1
Knee height full tosses is the new death bowling meta,2
Not a single yorker..,1
"This is pretty shit death bowling imo

Far too straight from round the wicket

Needs to be pushing it outside off

Easier said than done tbf",4
"Looks like Mumbai aiming for just 200 only ,,they need atleast 15 per over from now on",2
MI hitting 1/5th of the sixes,2
The fuck is this full toss ?,1
"Man, we are getting appreciations for the fielding but not saved runs in this match",3
Dude - no full tosses.,1
3rd catch today on the boundary not caught.,2
Why the fuck do you bowl full toss to Pollard and Pandya,1
Anything below 200 would be a very good effort from SRH,3
they gonna regret that one,1
Why the fuck is he bowling full toss,1
"So, if SRH don't bowl any illegal deliveries, it is impossible for MI to get past 263 now.",3
What could Zaheer Khan be taking notes on after the Polllard six (17.1)? Where not to bowl when it‚Äôs his team is out to bowl perhaps..?,1
Looks like they're gonna get around 210,2
Really hope that we have the same kind of luck with ball as well.,3
3 leg-stump full-tosses In 4 balls. Not good bowling.,3
Anything less than 210 is disappointing,5
I myself saw 25 runs of misfielding,3
Atleast fucking put the boundary ropes back could have been couple of easy wickets.,6
Dafuq is sandeep doing?,1
"r/cricket logic:

Just bowl better bro

Liek no shit sherlock",9
Sandeep doesnt bowl yorkers?,1
Poor Telugu commentary. They expect every thing that's middled to be a boundary.,6
Why isn't the fielder on the boundary line?,1
"Meh, I can‚Äôt shit on Sandeep. He‚Äôs not very good in the death but great with the new ball imo",3
Out out out out plz,1
"Last 5 overs, Pandya-Pollard, this has worked a treat for MI",1
Excellent so far from Sandeep Sharma? WTF,2
220 seems like par score every match here,1
Pooran would have caught that and in between done a moon walk,5
murali karthik doing a manjrekar,3
Kaul vs Nattu. Who bowls the 19th?,1
Impact outside leg stump,2
Polly a total unit,3
Reviewing....,1
Pandya has been so casual today.,3
outside leg,-1
That looked out,2
People criticising the tough drops in 40¬∞ heat as if they themselves can do better,16
"Pitching outside leg stump, if it's not then we can dance",5
That's out.... It's not,0
Honestly MI have been mediocre so many shots barely clearing the fielder if it was a bigger ground they would be screwed,8
Out?,0
Kaul has an over?‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è,6
Comfortably outside leg,3
fuck I think that's out,1
Umpires call pitching outside,2
Is it just me or does Pandya actually look like he is trying to strike a pose every second,12
15 runs in death overs at Sharjah is actually pretty top notch. Don't know why is he getting criticized so much.,8
OUT,-1
Looks slightly outside leg,2
Looks out.,2
Whose uncle is this third umpire,18
Yikes,1
At least it's a dot ball,3
Pitching leg,2
Good decision that,3
Phew! Outside leg,3
Why is ultraedge needed on that!,1
Phew,2
Jfc this drs system is so bureaucratic,4
What a decision,2
Fuckin good decision by a Desi umpire,6
Totally disappointing from a team like Mumbai. Expected at least 120 sixes from them.,6
2 more overs under 200 i will be the happiest dude,2
Fantastic umpiring!!!!,1
What's the rule with outside leg for LBW and why does it invalidate an appeal?,6
"If Natrajan's form holds up, Sandeep Sharma might have to start looking at classifieds",1
Looked out even on DRS,4
"26 runs this over, 200
26 runs last over, 226 

Subscribe",2
Natu time babyy,1
Jeez stop bothering the third umpire. Let him have his ice cream in the A/c room.,8
Anything under than 200 is huge for SRH...,5
Surely atleast 30 off kauls final over,4
200 in this over?,2
Umpire works as railways announcer as his day job,10
Meanwhile advertisers: never waste an over break,7
Kaul in the last over is gonna be disastrous,9
3D chess by Mumbai to wait for 20th over to do some onslaught,7
Destroy Nattu and Kaul,2
Pollard is ridiculous,5
A job well done by SRH bowlers if MI is restricted to 200 or below.,4
The museli ad girl reminds me of sidebottom and his curly hair.,2
Srh : Full toss,1
"Last 3 overs, all had 6 on the first ball",6
"oh no , Kaul with 20 over :(",3
Damn what a power,3
Why the full toses?,1
"Pitching and Impact shouldn‚Äôt be considered for LBW reviews, change my mind.",-1
Last 3 overs have started with a six and ended with hopelessness,5
Boult is like how many sixes am.i gonna get hit for?,7
"Commentators are still completing the sentence, Hotstar: let me put in some ad",3
Pollard is a cheatcode,3
Williamson last over,2
Fucking edge goes for 6 over long off.,3
"Alright, 205 on 

Maybe 210",6
No SRH. You can't bowl full tosses,2
Bowling full toss to both Pollard and Pandya is crime.,2
DC had reached 200 by end of 18th over. MI is one over behind.,3
Srh have already lost this match,0
There‚Äôs daylight between bat and ball and yet the third umpire wants to see ultra edge?,3
"This guy hits flat 6s for 80+ meters, wtf",4
Nice Yorker,2
The pollard chant sounds a bit like 'Morya' of ganpati bappa 'morya',3
Yes pls. Keep bowling fu tosses to Pollard and Pandya,3
Pollard proving all haters wrong. Dude has been ridiculous this season,2
With natus pace a Yorker can easily become a full toss of pillar wants to,1
Honestly low full tosses at the wide line aren't bad balls at all. Pollard just has incredible reach lol,11
Natarajan why not just bowl the first ball also yorker bro,3
"Mind you the fact, the same pitch was used less than 24 hours ago üëÄ",1
"Good come back nat, bowl offside wide to Pandya

Ok he still hit that to boundary. SMH",2
"Kaul last over?

Ayyy lmoa",3
kaul to bowl last over with the economy rate of 14.3,4
cant blame the pitch of they keep bowling full tosses,3
Pollard is too OP that they should make him bat left handed to handicap his power.,2
200-210 is too close for comfort,3
"I remember how much criticism Polly got last season for being shit. 

Glad he‚Äôs on fire this season",6
A boring match incoming tonight,3
Is it me or does the Altroz look like every other damn Tata car ever?,3
Pollard has no mercy,2
Awesome batting that.,2
Even a yorker going for 4 lmao,3
Why Abhishek was not bowled today. He is a decent bowler.,1
How small is Sharjah in comparison to MCG? Does anyone have a graphic comparison?,3
Nattu should just stick to yorkers. Lower full tosses are being tonked too.,3
Pollard and Pandya are soooo fucking good man,2
"Honestly, Sandeep has been pretty good. I thought he would get smacked all over but he's done pretty well. On the other hand Kaul...",4
KAUL TO GO FOR 25 IN THE LAST,2
"Bowling outside off yorkers with backward point in the circle and no wide third man?

Dumb.",2
"Even if MI get 30 more, it will be the lowest 1st innings score at Sharjah so far this season.",3
Obviously the bowlers practice yorkers and batsmen practice for full tosses :),1
"Can Warner have 2 people, one over the other in the deep mid wicket",1
Srh has lost it.,2
damn that was smart,1
Unfair.,3
On such a small outfield you can't ball full tosses at Pollard,1
"No room for error... Attempting Yorkers and if slightly off their full tosses or full length, which these guys pounce on",3
"Just get 15 off this (yeah, just). Next over will be 20+ anyways",4
Mumbai's middle order looks good. Wish we had similar in CSK,3
Why not have a fielder there when you are going to bowl outside off,1
"The thing with pollard is that he got shit last year 
But when we needed him he always played 
He was the reason that Mumbai has 4 titles.",8
Straight Yorkers? What happened to them?,2
"I wonder if there's an advantage in batting first in these earlier games simply cause the heat is exhausting, causing bowling and fielding mistakes",5
Nattu will be a star,4
Pollard truly is an Altroz super-striker.,7
LMAO 20 Yorkers and 2nd is only 7.,21
"These two are taking turns to beat our asses, SMH. Pray for our last over bowler",4
"This is a great contest. 

Natarajan vs polly and pandya.",6
Fuck Hotstar is 1 ball slow than Cricbuzz.,19
Dude has most Yorkers by a wild margin,36
Bit slow this,2
20 Yorkers! My goodness,21
They should have at least taken Thampi instead of Kaul.,8
Nattu has bowled more yorkers than entire RCB bowling,26
"Having watched Tom Curran bowl this IPL, his figures don't look great but he's been let down by some shocking fielding too",17
Nailed the last ball,6
did Natarajan ever play for CSK,2
Anything under 220 is a sucess imo,4
In B4 MI buys Nattu in next auction and benches him,9
This is terrific bowling,4
Fuck look at the difference between first and second on that yorkers list. This guy next season is going to get big money,9
Yorkers all day everyday baby,6
Brilliant yorkers,5
Natrajan brilliant bowler,7
Nattu is a damn good bowler,7
 Nattu good. Kaul bad.,2
It‚Äôs time to call kaul... nightmare stuff incoming,2
Nattu and Mavi are my new favorite Indian uncapped bowlers.,2
Nattu boy is extraordinary. Watch koach draft him into the Indian team and destroy him.,2
"Pretty good over

Especially after that first ball 6

Bowls yorkers so well",2
Excellent over from Natarajan.,4
"Mumbai's struggle to get past 10 run rate on Sharjah continues till last over then.

So much on brand.",3
Natarajan is fucking impressive. Yorker execution is unparalleled this season.,6
These was a great great great over from nattu,5
MI need like atleast 20 from this,1
Shame this good over is going to be undone by Kaul,1
Brilliant.,2
"Oh my fucking god natarajan
Where have you been till now",3
Natarajan is a fucking gem,6
"Bowling Nat, beautiful comeback after that first boundary. Great bowling",1
Aight tighten your seatbelts for kaul bois. It‚Äôs gonna be a bumpy-boundary driven ride,4
[deleted],13
Where is Bumrah in that yorker list?,7
"Exceptional by Natarajan, just 29 runs in Sharjah heat",9
Nattu has been on point in this match as well. Well done man!,3
"Damn son, those dot balls are like gold at this stage of innings!",7
"Don't bowl a 30 run over, Headband Man.",4
In death at Sharjah. That was a pretty good over too from Nattu.,7
is Natarajan the best Indian Yorker bowler now since Bumrah has lost his touch,2
Leaving full toss aside. Those are decent amount of Yorkers.,2
Nattu what a ball. Great find for SRH. Somebody give this guy a raise.,4
Boom boom Bumrah really has to get his Yorkers today,1
So if kaul concedes 24 runs it will be 211.. Quite possible.,2
"This is a bit underwhelming innings, not a single over went above 18 runs",2
Kaul lord to wind it up.,1
"Brilliant spell from Natarajan. 

Sometimes it feels like yorkers are a dying art..",3
Barkha singh is a cutieüòç,3
Iyer+Pant >>> Pollard+Pandya at Sharjah.,2
"If Kaul can keep MI under 200, headband sales will sky rocket.",4
"Apply sunscreen ,put glasses and bowl NAT in the last over as well. /s",3
Bring me the feast of the fifth bowler.,1
20+ in the last over please,2
"With SRH' lean batting lineup, even 200 if as good as 225.",3
Someone needs to hurry up and find how to clone. We could use 2 more natarajans for the team,2
Damn I be feeling bad for kaul tbh,1
"5 yorkers, excellent over. One yorker got hit for 4 and one ball where he missed the length went for 6.",2
Easy 25 runs here,2
Nattu is a gem. Fantastic. Now nobody tell him to bowl slowers or shit just have him sharpen these honed in missiles and bowl them all death,8
[removed],2
"Last 3 overs, all had 6 on the first ball

MI Supporters: Har bar garam karke thanda hi chhod dete hai",7
If kaul can keep this under 200 we have a Chance,1
Only 40 runs in last 4 overs... Will take that any day against MI on these grounds,3
Kaul 50 incoming,1
I feel like pandya misses out on many boundary opportunities due to that going deep in the crease movement,3
What‚Äôs the final over gonna be fore,1
He gets it right all the fucking time. That's just disgusting,2
"Band is back, give us your worst. Am ready for 36",1
"Gentle block picked up calmly by Nattu.

EXPLOSION SOUND EFFECT!!!!",3
oh boy. This is the over I am worried about,3
Will be madness to not play nattu in t20 wc,4
Natrajan made Abu Dhabi out of Sharjah with his Yorkers,7
MI has lost this unless Bumrah and Boult bowl good,4
"They're going to get 30 off this over aren't they






fuck",2
Now do you guys think MI will be able to reach 200?,3
"send in kano, maybe he bowls a dot or two as compared to 25-30 off kaul",0
Kaul incometh?,2
Get ready for carnage,3
That red band is Dinda Academy goodies,3
Need 210 atleast,1
Max we chase is 218.,1
Anything under 220 in this ground is actually a decent bowling. And 10.60 RPO from 14-19 is excellent bowling.,4
Props to natrajan for executing yorkers under pressure.,2
26 runs my guess,1
Nattu gave his powers to Kaul?,3
Will we see a kaul redemption arc,3
Please give kaul a wig for the last over...,6
This death bowling is ridiculous man,6
Kaul is gonna surprise everyone with his bowling.,8
20 run over?,0
"Holy shit a perfect yorker from kaul, what's this fuckery",8
Sid Kaul is on. Not the headbanderson you were hoping for.,4
Nattu nailing those yorkers. Another good spell.,3
Inb4 Kaul bowls a <10 run over,5
Damn,3
Bowled,3
Kaul redemption arc.,3
"SRH if next year mega auction
Retain:
Warner
Bhuvi
Rashid
RTM
Kane
Bairstow

Also these 5 players i never want to see SRH leave",2
Redemption time for Kaul.,5
Nice execution,1
166666 when? MI is a sham if they don't hit 5 6s now.,6
Kaul: fuck r/cricket,1
Why wasn‚Äôt Kaul bowling like this before,3
Really lousy innings from MI considering Sharjah and all that. Never got going. Nice bowling SRH.,8
What a fucking ball,5
What the...,2
KAULLLLL,3
Oh that's a brilliant ball,3
Kaul you beauty,5
We memed Kaul to greatness,7
Peak 2020,7
Rip no 200,3
Great death bowling!,3
Kaul redemption arc.,5
Beauty!,3
"*Bowled him yessssss, the band. The band has Power*",9
"Crazy good bowling, especially considering it‚Äôs Sharjah",6
Kaul with lucky dinda headband,3
Dude wow. 2 perfect yorkers in 2 balls. Holy shit.,11
Kaul is literally better than Wasim and Waqar combined,6
This is what made Kaul so good in 2018,11
Dinda Dinda...uhh I mean Kallu Kallu....,1
sexy yorker,3
Head band guy redeems himself,7
That's some sexy Yorker by Kaul.,4
Kaul: FUCK R/CRICKET,8
"Great start to the over here from Kaul

Can't wait for the inevitable 4 sixes to finish",4
Bruvvvvvv whatttt SID KAUL GOT KUNGFU PANDYAAAAA,5
Kaul redemption arc has started,6
Bro wtf,2
Outstanding death bowing. Sensational,9
SRH showing mad yorker skills in death,2
OMFG Kaul!! What a Yorker,3
And Kaul redeems himself,4
Perfect yorker,7
LETS GOOO,2
That's Nattu in make-up,1
"What in the living hell is this, my boi Pandya gone",2
Fucking Kaul bowling yorkers.,2
Atleast 200,1
What the fuck happened then to you so far god damn it,2
Kal redemption thread,3
Fuck we bullied kaul back into form,5
"Good job, Headband Man.",2
R E D E M P T I O N‚Ñ¢,2
Wow! Kaul gets a wicket here,3
If only Nattu didn't benchwarm two yrs in SRH dugout:(,2
This is not the Sharjah which was promised,1
"Natarajan in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy this season:

11 matches, 13 wickets, avg 16.84, ER 5.84

If he keeps bowling like this, he should be in the India squad soon.",3
Great now Hardick's gone,1
Why can't he stand still In crease and play?,2
Did Kaul go to nets in between to practice?,2
Opens mask. It's bhuvi,5
"Boys, popcorn is ready for this 5 balls",1
Surprise pikachu.png,3
Pandya sold that yorker like The Rocks sells 'The Stunner' !,2
that was hitwicket right?,0
Hardik was doing too much doing dandiya anyway,3
">Yorkers are the best ball.

Murali in his interview earlier.",9
Bro Kaul you could have done that whole match!!!,4
Kaul to r/cricket rn:üñïüèΩüòÜüòÜ,5
"Kaul !!

Brett Lee gonna dance today",3
That was in the slot if he stayed still ffs,4
They really need to take a gigantic leap in this final over or SRH are really well in the game.,2
Yeah someone is reading comments in thread and passing it to Kaul.,3
Kaul called tewatia for inspiration between overs,3
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j4vdg4/-/g7nvrqp,2
Better Kaul Sid!,2
"2 dot balls, and pollar is at the other end nice",1
Kaul ka karara prahaar,1
Ofcourse MI is the team that doesnt get 200 on this pitch lmao,1
That was a fucking seed of doom if I've ever seen one,3
Will take even 200 now,3
We gonna need a redemption thread for all the srh players soon,4
Kaul looks like a former alcoholic trying to turn his life around,2
Please get to 200 BC,1
Isn't this score underwhelming for MI batting lineup,1
"**19.2** Kaul to HH Pandya, OUT, base of leg stump. This is great stuff by SRH at death. Pandya goes deep into the crease to try to turn a yorker into a half-volley but Kaul sticks to his guns and squeezes this under his bat **188-5**

HH Pandya  b Kaul 28 (19b 2x4 2x6) SR: 147.36",1
This is the best Yorker I've seen today. Not that because it got us a wicket. But it's absolutely nailed.,6
190 is less score on this gound,1
2 redemptions in a single innings. Damn.,2
Kaul maybe I judged you too harshly,1
Two runs from Rashid's last over. Bad call see him off.,2
Kaul getting inspired from Nattu,1
"The bowling has honestly been poor here, but the batting has been worse. There were atleast 6 full tosses in the last 5 overs that were singles. Playing out Rashid Khan with dots.",3
"What a ball.

Now pandya has to stand behind the stumps to play these yorkers.",6
Anything less than 200 on this Sharjah pitch is a paychological victory for Warner.,3
They've sent in Bhuvi with a Kaul mask. Chitting SRH,5
There is that one guy in very match with the fuck you to r/cricket lol,1
Drunk cameraman,1
Cameraman is drunk todayüòÜü§£ü§£ü§£,22
Insane camerawork.,11
"kaul is like, first I'll bowl pies so they get comfortable then beam them with perfect yorkers",3
Omg Rashid only gave two runs againt P-P  in 16th over at Sharjah what's this scorcery,4
Cameraman can't see shit,4
No Sidd Kaulllll whyy man loduuuu why change length!!!!!!!!,3
Switch the camera person next innings please,8
"Pandya out, Pandya in",6
Bhuvi injured today?,2
Camera man smoking weed,5
Camera man has ruined today's match for me,4
SRH since ages has been the best bowling squad.,1
RIP camerawork,5
Is an intern doing camera work today,5
"Finally Krunal got the chance and nailed it, hope it's not another 1 six over now",2
Easy chase for SRH,2
A lineup of 4 domestic bowlers and Rashid Khan might restrict us below 200 at Sharjah. Jeez man I was hoping 230+ at the start of the innings,5
Oh fuck man,1
That felt like a catch in any ground,3
"Ball goes up

Cameraman: I don't get paid enough for ths",9
What a shit camera work,4
What's up with the cameraman today?,4
OG Pandya is here,3
"Why wasn't Hardik out for LBW? Happened before he got bowled, right?",0
Krunal God pandya,3
"We were all thinking SRH‚Äôs death bowling was the worst, now what do you call this camera work?",8
Camerman is having the worst game of his life,7
Bhaijaan...,1
Some of the worst camera work I've ever seen,3
"MI taking it too casually , I guess they are gonna regret underestimating SRH batting",1
"Why can't they just change the freaking camera angle ,let us see something ffs",1
Kaul is back,1
Thought he threw away his wicket there,1
Kaul back to bowling pies,2
Dude just got a wicket off a Yorker and thinks how about go for slowers now. Wtf kaul,2
Krunal and his back breaking chaukke and chakke,2
Pandya Bros are ridiculous,7
"It's ok , expect them to hit boundaries,can't stop everything",2
Kaul' redemption arc didn't last long lol. /r/cricket really knows their shit bowlers,8
Is Bhuvi's injury serious?,1
Krunal Pandya reminds me of a cheer leader,0
Sid is back,1
kaul fuck u to r/cricket,3
Hardik smirking on his big bro batt,5
"Well, that didn't last long",1
The runs are already too many for SRH's batting.,1
Cameraman woahhh,1
"Natarajan has been impressive. Credit to SRH overall so far, they've had a plan, have done their best to execute it. Stood by it even when they couldn't execute it to perfection or get hit for a good shot. This is so important in grounds like these, where mishits can go the distance.",5
Hardik with that smirk. He knows what his brother can do,12
Camera guy doesn't deserve to get paid today,10
Pandya literally called his elder brother to bully the bully.,58
That euphoria of getting Hardhik out is slowly disappearing,10
Haha cameraman can‚Äôt find cute girls todayü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™,6
who was that cunt calling **Krunal a cheerleader**,15
Kaul is terrible. Jesus,6
Krunal> Hardik,2
Where are those who said SRH will concede 250 today,3
Cameraman please,5
"Yep, the wicket was a fluke",5
KRUNAL BABY,1
Didn't expect it from Krunal but this is Sharjah,2
Kaul on 58,2
Lmao what camera work is that,1
wtf is wrong with the cameras today?,1
Full toss or in the slot.,1
"who the fucks commentating 

goes off at Kaul for not bowling a Yorker then starts going about about the margin for error with it being so little when he just misses it",1
The cameraman literally searched for the ball at that shot lol,5
"Jadeja, this is how you play in t20s.",1
Now it's turned to be another shit over even with those brilliant Yorkers in the beginning,1
Hardik be like....yup....thats my boy,2
This IPL has absolutely killed all the glory that Sharjah had for me as an Indian fan. To watch fuckin Krunal come in and cunt the first ball on to Ganguly's roof is demeaning.,7
KRUNAL DADDDDDDDYYYY,1
Ngl he had us in the first half,2
Cameraman you are drunk in the afternoon,2
Discount Pandya vs Discount Dinda,4
Thank fuck for the 200,1
Hah. 200 up finally.,1
Did they get some guy off the street to handle the camera?,1
"It's ok Kaul, other pandya would have hit sixes. Fours are ok",3
So they managed to reach 200 huh,2
**#FUCK CAMERAMAN**,4
"What hell is the cameraman smoking?  
Seems to be some good shit",7
Fuck camera that was not even difficult,4
Kaul redemption arc over.,1
Why tf does the camera man pan to the boundary and THEN BACK TO KRUNAL before the ball even crosses the boundary?,3
Kaul does not have speed but has a lengthy run up like  Shoaib Akhtar.,2
"Dinda caressing his head band, sobs, ""do it for both of us Kaul. do it for all the head band bowlers""",6
That small smile from Hardik as his brother hits the boundaries,9
Krunal channelling his inner Hardik,4
Did they hire a wedding videographer to cover this game?,44
"I'm just saying, maybe a third over for Kane would've been worth it.",7
Krunal is the Hardik we needed.,1
kaul on sue of side watch,2
Damn Krunal is the Altroz superstriker of the match,9
"Cool down pandya, you gotta bowl in a while",2
Might as well listen to the match on radio,3
sorry Khallel you are amazing,10
7th staright 200+ at Sharjah,5
Kaul Madarchod,3
"Excellent batting.

Shitty camerawork.",9
Krunal 20(4),6
Krunal getting pumped up as if he scored a100. calm your tits lad,6
Oh brilliant,3
Kaul 64 runs,1
There‚Äôs the Kaul we know,9
[Close enough lmao] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j4vdg4/match_thread_17th_match_mumbai_indians_v/g7o03pw),1
Kaul 64 please.,6
Krunal Freaking Pandya! Thank you very muchüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ,9
"No use, Hardik's wicket....",6
12 runs short,1
KRUNALLLL,2
Kaul ruined it. SRH were actually bowling really well,7
Record break from kaul. Even Williamson could've bowled better fucking hell,4
Sid Kaul should basically retire,2
Krunal out of nowhere lmaooooo,4
The problem for bowlers not too fast is that they are too risk averse to try bouncers,3
I will do better with my gopro,3
"How many redemptions we'll have this year.?

2020: *Yes*",7
This ground is a fucking joke,5
Cameraman jerking off with one hand or what ?,30
Kaul 4 overs for 64 lol,2
Camerawork's shittier than Kaul in the last 4 balls,6
F for the cameraman,11
Shitty camera work,5
What a cameo son!,5
2-64 lmao,8
Kaul kaul ke maara,4
Anyone else think the camera work has been shit this match? They keep losing the ball after it gets hit lmao.,19
Smash Pandya bros,5
THE PUNISHER.,6
Mauled,3
Damn what a brilliant cameo,6
That‚Äôs the end of Kaul this IPL hopefully. Would have been 190 with a competent bowler,1
sorry I called you discount hardik üò≠üò≠,11
21 runs of Kaul‚Äôs. Over is still a win for SRH,9
"Fucking kaul, even dinda was better. Bowling in the slot again and again like a retard.",1
I took to long to type the last joke and now Kaul is back to his usual self. SMH,10
64 off Kaul's overs,8
Kaul made a magnificent 64(24)!,10
Cameraman be shit ngl,3
64 runs by Kaul. What a knock!!,5
I wasnt expecting 20 from krunal pandya,8
Krunal proving all haters wrong. He got so much criticism this season,8
One Pandya always delivers,8
Krunal gave a fighting total but toss curse should favour SRH,5
Aur ye ganganchumbi chakka. I am assuming coz nobody can see where the fuck ball went,8
208 is not that intimidating at Sharjah tbh,3
Krunal boii striking at 500 oh myyyy,6
"If this Krunal can show up more consistently, he and Hardik should be 6 and 7 for India.",6
Thanks for coming this season kaul. Go back home now,3
Bandana curse is real,4
Maadarjaat kaul,6
"4 ball khel ne aata hu, gaand maar ke jata hu",13
there goes your **cheerleader**,1

"Thank goodness, don't have to see Kaul again this ipl.",5
Pandya to pandya: Bhai ka badla lega re tera Krunal.,11
So cameraman missed all the boundaries of Krunal. Fuck you,8
Kaul doesn‚Äôt deserve to wear that headband,4
"Brilliant bowling by SRH, despite lack of Bhuvi and going in with only 4 bowlers.

Kaul could've been better.",5
please fire this cameraman,7
Never have I ever thought krunal to be this aggressive! Quite pleased with the target,6
"Krunal be like ""aaj mein bhi kar ke aaya""",30
Kaul's bowling is as bad as his hairline. That was a shocking over ffs,5
Godzilla had a stroke after seeing this camera work,16
"Sunrises got all the wickets at the right time still 210 , what is this ground",5
"First things first

We should be looking at chasing 25 runs less, what the fuck is the fielding today. More concerning than the 5th bowler",3
That camerawork is almost found footage film level amateurish.,29
Kaul is meme worthy. What a bowler,3
Kauls bowling figure are 2-64 against MI,5
64(24) for Kaul. What figures! Altroz superstriker of the match for me üòç,21
Good that Krunal had the hunger to prove me wrong. I‚Äôll bash him next time.,5
Fucking sid kaul ruined the previous 4 overs,5
why didn't Krunal come in earlier?,0
Pandya bros: *ek ke sath ek free*,9
SRH fans to kaul be like abey saale,2
64(24),1
Imagine Bhuvi instead of Kaul and the score would've been even lower,6
"Bruh I have seen higher scores on this ground and it seems like there was a boundary every ball

Honestly bowling was decent all things considered",5
We are all living in Sid Kaul's world,2
I was played into believing a less than 200 score but that's an excellent comeback from Lord Kaul.,4
r/killthecameraman,12
Prediction : Either of the openers goes back in the first 2 overs.,4
Can't blame the ground. Those sixes would've been six anywhere.,4
"Kaul knocked over little brother's stumps, big brother then came in and taught him a lesson",6
64(24) SR:266.67,6
Seems to be cakewalk chase with srh batting and fact it's shariah,6
he bowled like couple overs worth of fulltosses lol,3
"I pretty much called it

Said he'd go for 4 sixes but he went for 2 sixes and 2 fours instead",2
20(4) wtf man,3
Kaul has lost so much hair.,5
"Warner Anna, Bairstow Anna unleash you best today, we should win this match. Bowlers did their best including Kane.",5
Lmao the bowler conceded 64 runs in his spell,8
Krunal: discount jadeja who?,3
What are the worst bowling spells of all time in IPL? Surely this one has to be in the top 10.,2
Wtf he gave 64 runs in 4 overs. Billy stanlake would have have saved 20 runs at least.,11
IDK but SRH should be actually happy with this total. Expected worse today.,20
Despite all the 6s probably the best death bowling in the IPL this year so far,16
Not too bad considering we didn‚Äôt have Bhuvi,11
Kaul regretting his wicket probably,8
Maybe they should use a different colored ball when it‚Äôs this bright outside,5
This total is a nothingburger. SRH should get this honestly.,5
Krunal is so animated,5
Sid Kaul you know. Anyways SRH will win this easily. This is Sharjah.,3
"Other than kaul, the bowlers did really well. Hopefully MI can use it as a template.",6
Krunal 500 Pandya,3
"Well done MI, imagine scoring less than CSK here",11
Krunal saved the day for MI.. wouldve been disaster if they were below 200,7
"r/killthecameraman

Amature hours in last over",18
Krunal on track to score 100* off 20.,5
The bowling skill difference bw srh and mi is stark,4
Kaul wearing a hairband with that hairline should be criminal.,14
Great effort by SRH with this bowling attack. Very impressive!! üëåüëèüëè,6
Best bowling lineup in IPL bois.,12
"‚ÄòHow did you go today?‚Äô 

‚ÄòGot two wickets..‚Äô",22
"I know Krunal played well but man, that useless acting he did is just shit. Acting like he is some kind of Kohli or Dhoni who we are just too eager to watch.",4
He bowled a perfect yorker to Hardik and then 4 shit balls to Krunal,15
Kaul living up to the curse of the head band.,10
Last 4 overs great work ruined in 4 balls.... 64 runs,8
Kaul 4-0-64-2,9
In & out krunal looks like aaj woh karke aaya hai,5
"should've sent kurnal first in rashid overs and tell him to go ham, at worst we'd be a wicket short, at best we'd be 20 runs ahead",3
Kaul unhappy he couldnt be the highest scorer in the match,4
"that's sad  no one waited for Kaul, last to leave the field by himself",7
Kaul can go fuck himself. Should've slipped in Samad's third over in somewhere before 15th over.,12
"Cameraman:""krunal bsdk dekh ke maarta...aaj meri naukri jayegi""",10
Warner Bairstow Kanos Pandey time to step tf up,3

Is this the lowest first innings total in Sharjah?,6
Well batted Mumbai.,1
I would say on par for a day game.,6
"Excellent innings from Kaul 64(24).




Fuck you mf! Don't ever comeback.",17
warner looks  mad lmao. hope he shows up and does what he does best.,9
I remember a different kaul. The change hurts bad man...,7
Now cameraman turned camera off. Feed is cut off,8
"hmm, all these sharjah high scores are ruining my perception of a certain innings that totally does not rhyme with notDessert notStorm.",12
Krunal is probably high with hardik's marijuana. Playing and reacting just like his brother.,11
"Yea, CSK bitches' 200 is still the lowest score at this ground",2
MI had to search really hard for that one good over which only came in the 20th. I put that as a W for SRH. The chase must be a cakewalk if they keep wickets in tact.,3

"People who called Krunal as discount Pandya probably forgot his many match winning innings, his best imo being in the ipl 2017 final making MI reach 129 at a stage where even a 100 seemed tough since MI collapsed",20
"Dream 11 gave more points to Kaul than they did to Rashid, the gave 39 to Rashid and 48 to Kaul. What a dumbass fantasy league app.",9
If you ignore Kaul's half century - SRH bowling was massively impressive considering this tiny ground,14

">Shaam tak chakke marange inki gaand fat jayegi

"I know they made 208 but it feels like a par score compared to all the others.

I know Kaul have like 20+ in his last over but the bowling overall did a great job without Bhuvi.",16
"Saw a comment earlier saying Krunal was just a cheerleader for MI.. 20(4). 500 SR.  

Not bad for a cheerleader huh?",16
How do you give away 64 runs and still get to finish all 4 lol,9
"Remember when Krunal saved MI vs RPS in the finals. I shall never forget his contribution to MI. 

Dude is essential to this team",18
Now that's a ~~Kaul~~ Krunal redemption,4
Could have done better but it's okay. Let's see what the batsmen do.,4
"I'm actually happy with how deep our batting is today yo, let's hope we can win this one ü§û",3
"Just lit the first fire of the year, winter is coming mofos",2
My money is on MI. SRH gotta play outside their skins and souls to chase this against MI bowling,7
Thampi wouldv'e bowled better.,8
"Kaul surprised us and did what we expected of him in the same over.

Respect++",8
"u/RLKay Natarajan really has the potential to be our Fizz this time. Bowled incredibly well. 

I think 208 is a par score.",11

Also, SRH does have decent strikers of their own and if they can get hold of any 2-3 bowlers from Mumbai I think this game will be interesting. I think Bumrah and Boult will probably nullify the good work by Rashid and Natarajan,  SRH will have to make up for the mauling Kaul received.",9

"Question: Why don‚Äôt Pakistan play their test matches at Sharjah? It‚Äôs such a better ground than the other two, particularly Abu Dhabi. Way more character, history and just generally looks like a great cricket ground",1
Only warner can pull off that pedo moustache,8
"As they talk about planting the front leg firmly, I immediately think of the original master blaster Viv Richards. God I can't image what that man would have done had he played T20",1
What's up with MI fans reverse jinxing this year??,3
Stupid Sexy Bairstow,2
How come Bairstow only played  about 120 t20 matches when he is same age as Buttler.,2
Mi should buy starc next season. Imagine Bumrah and Starc bowling side by side,5

What does Mumbai Indians and sun risers Hyd even mean? Srh and mi fans...,1
"Alright, prediction time guys. Give me realistic predictions please. Keep in mind this is the lowest first innings score in Sharjah and SRH have some explosive batsmenüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ",1
Warners useless 35(35) will be of no use here lol,-2
[deleted],2
Srh will do this without any wickets,-2
Pattinson 4 overs will decide whether we win or lose this game,4
Dugout scaring me with all these wicket alerts,7
That's the line Pattinson,0
Ek wicket chahiye mujhe Patinson,4
Something about Pattinson's appearance makes him look like an alcoholic,5
Robert Pattinson aala re,4
" Even the dugout doesn‚Äôt think SRH can pull this off, calling it a wicket over 2 times in a row",4
Yeh wicket mujhe de de Pattinson,3
Warner just needs to make it to face all 4 of Krunals overs and he can take 60 off him easily,7
[deleted],7
By Pandey‚Äôs standards that was a 4,4
Shot.,3
Boult is a gun fielder,5
Iirc Sharjah was one of the stadiums in cricket 07. Time to hit a 720,3

Ok that's Umesh level spraying at the legside,3
BC laude lag rahe hain,4
Should MI bring Mitch Mcleneghan instead of pattinson considering that he has been constantly getting wickets for the team and is a lucky charm for them?,2
Will it be the david warner show today??,1

Fucking love you Johnny bhai,8
"Everytime Murali Karthik speaks, I go: Agar thesaurus nai hoti, toh tu commentator hota Kya?",2

Giving Rahul Chahar an over here could be a good idea.,2
1 boundary per over is must to chase in Sharjah. A Boundary less over just means you're asking to be strangled.,18
Memebai violently oscillating between sublime and atrocious between games. Lol.,4
Did he bowl a yorker?,1
Oh shit,1

Warner is throwing all his energy at it,3

"Either krunal will end up getting one of them, or get tonked",4
Wtf does agricultural mean in the context of cricket,7
Camera man having a field dayüòÇ,6
Bumrah will be the difference today,7
Fucking cameraman,6
Why does Krunal look like he's going to sell me Vimal Pan Masala,9
"Nobody:

Doull on comms: this is AgRiCuLtUrAL",12
I feel Rashid over is going to bite them in the back. They could have atleast taken 1s and 2s nope we will show how good our defence is.,2

These Cred ads are getting old,1
Time for warner to score something,2
I like the RR is being managed at 10.,5
74m six went 10 rows behind..,3
Holding Bumrah back is kinda smart given how the death overs here are.,3
"This should be a pretty easy win for SRH tbh, this wicket is insanely tough to bowl on.",3
Bairstow will turn full body ginger after playing in this heat for 4 hours,5
Is star getting the feed from local cable tv?,3
"Should bring in Rahul Chahar, I recall he got Bairstow last season",0
Pattinson better get his shit together tonight or this chase is over soon.,6
I think Sanjay's insights are the best,0
Why is lsk talking about dhoni,3
Warner hasn‚Äôt been his usual self. Hope Bairstow can help him out.,5
STOP TALKING ABOUT DHONI,11
easy peasy win for SRH,4
"I expect more from Boult and Patty.

Bumrah is not bowled initially to preserve him for Death overs.

Rohit has to turn to Krunal in the powerplay itself",2
No offence but both Pandya brothers have punchable faces. Sorry guys nothing personal.,8
Cameraman angry because he cannot show hot girls thanks to the empty stadium.,13
Warner‚Äôs batting looks more bairstow than bairstow,6
Bumrah over next please,2
warner need to take his time,1
Dude Warner really lost his form didn't he,4
Warner is struggling big time,1
"Only this pitch can bring Warner to form. If not, Srh is in more trouble.",6
Warner struggling on Sharjah is bad sign,2
Warner as clueless as the cameraman,3
Just saw a couple of kids in audience. How is it allowed?,3
I wanna see Doull in a Headband,4
Williamson's beard for Doull.,2
Pandey holding his bat like it's an axe,1
Thala Warner,6
Why is Kaul‚Äôs headband even an option? Shit looks ridiculous,4
There was a noise,2
Warner is struggling,1
Warner take a single,2
Warner just take a single damn it,3
Beard for sure!,2
Tuk tuk thaner,3
Damn I thought that was nicked,3
Formula1 has spoiled the concept of DRS for me.,5
Pandya what galichaap tattoo is thatüòí,4
Warner is scaring me,6
"Bumrah like Rohit is playing well only in alternate games so far. He did well in last game so going by that trend... Anyways, if he breaks the patterns and gets wickets, it's going to be hard to feel bad.",4
Pattinson needs a trim. Looks like he has a dead ferret on his head.,2
Pattinson my boi is thiccc af,5
"I mean Warner, even VJ scored at run-a ball!",2

Jeez",3
Warner man whats going on with him kinda tryna do too much i guess,1
Looks like Chahar gonna be murdered here,4
"Someone tell Warner all this setup is a tiktok, he might play better",12
Out of an Australian and a ginger englishman it shouldn't be the aussie that looks like he's got heatstroke,9
Pattinson bowling some good lengths today,3
Much better stuff this from Pattinson. Chef's kiss,6
Playing it smart is better. I don‚Äôt mind an over or two like this if it meant not losing a wicket.,2
Murli Kartik trying to be cute. Shut the fuck up for fucks sake,6
How long until Bairstow starts turning down singles here,9
Kohli found his form yesterday. It would be warner today!,4
Bairstow vs Pattinson is like a Battle between two thicc edgebois,7
"Coming up today on r/Cricket news , after sledging numerous players to form r/Cricket went after Manish Pandey's fielding , now it sets eyes on Warner",11
Thank fuck,7
Great placement from dave.,5

Do they have next match at same ground?,2
Man it's kinda painful to see Warner struggle so much,6
Tactical drop by MI there,2
"Ok that's lucky, might just be Warner's day",1
BC Warner lucky af,3
Bumrah‚Äôs a shit fielder,1
Warner mama you are scaring me lol. Pls don‚Äôt worry run-rate. Wickets are important.,11
Ball falling on the centroid of the triangle ffs,5
3 fielders lol,6
*Goti muh mein agaya*,9
My heart dropped for a second oof,9
Warner got a life,2
Petu Rohit ü§™,2
Though Warner would be a decent height given his kind of hard man persona but he's like 5 foot 6.,3
"Looks like Warner brought his Australia's english summar form to SRH. 

Looks very snappy and fidgity.",5
Fuckkkkkk,4
Which would suit Simon Doull better? WTF is this poll?,10
SRH dugout needs to chill. Can't take this too seriously.,3
Nice to see Warner finding unmanned spots,3
Exactly between 3 players. I mean what sorcery is this!!!,5
Warner struggling for timing on a flat deck,2
"Cameraman can't show hot girls. Pans the camera on Kanos. Everyone starts simping. 


*Modern problems require modern solutions.*",22
"between 3 fielders, that is lucky",3
Warner calm down pls,2
Ever since the first T20 against England Warner looks very restrictive in his batting,3
Calling it. No wicket next over. 14 runs.,11
"When Warner is short of confidence, he looks scratchy as hell and it is painful to watch",5
"warner got his luck, now he will score runs",3
Warner should just rotate strike for a while and play himself in. It isn't necessary to go crazy in first six,3
Jesus that is unbelievably lucky. Ball lands right in between 3 different fielders,4
Wtf kinda poll is this,2
Is there still heat between Warner and Qdk,4
F,4
"Imagine not being able to score runs in the powerplay in Sharjah eh Dave ?


He says with a personal high score of 7",3

Match gone.,6
DUNIYA HILA DENGE üòé,2
This wicket is taken by Warner not Boult,17
Oh yes,2
Game over,2
chuttad Shot,3
We saw this from De Kock too. Warner will probably eventually find his timing. This is the pitch for out-of-form batsmen to get back into form.,4
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes,5

Wrong guy got out,3
Warner has Murali Vijay posters in his room.,7
Fuck man i think here goes SRH downüòêüíî,1
Warner put extra pressure on Bairstow,5
Warner got to YJB,4
I don't believe it. MI bowlers picking up a wicket in powerplay.,13
This is trouble,2
ok bois bairstow did a pant today.,2
I could sense the Slow ball myself,2
Yeahhh That's my boult,1
Oh no!,1
fuck fuck fuck,2
fucksake that was properly the Bermuda Triangle of fielding,5
YJB: Am I Maxwell now,4
Warner got Bairstow out,1
YES DADDY,1
Bairstow dismissed by Warner,4
Pandya scared me for a moment.,2
Garg 75 to save the game imo.,7
Offtopic: What does people of Dubai or Sharjah think about IPL 2020?,2
"**4.1** Boult to Bairstow, OUT,  **34-1**

JM Bairstow c HH Pandya b Boult 25 (15b 2x4 2x6) SR: 166.66",3
lol n that‚Äôs on warner,3
Send in Williamson you cowards,1
Willimson or Pandey?,3
Boult is turning out to be much better here than his stay with Delhi!,6
150 all out.,3
Kane Warner partnership will be crucial now,3
Warney: runouts are inevitable,2
"Not the best ball, but the pace deceived him",5
Big F.,3
Fuck me! Why are we going for big ones,1
"It's just 4 overs ,you have good strike rate why? Straight to the fielder,fuck it. Still haven't got one good opening in this season.",1
Ah man. Not good for SRH with Warner struggling at the other end. The only positive note is that YJB did not get bowled :),8
"Guys, looks like I jinxed/reverse jinxed whichever way you look at it. Perspective matters ü§î",5
Imagine if bumrah starts bowling only after the 10 th over,6
Let's go boult,2
Pandey to play a test knock now,2
It should have been Williamson,1
If srh manages to score 40+ of bumrah they'll have a chance,6
SRH needs a partnership till at least 12-15 overs,4
"> Harsha: I still think Mumbai Indians use Pollard too conservatively. One of the most feared batsmen on one of the most dreaded pitches for bowlers only faces 13 balls!

When. Will. Mumbai. Realise. This.",19
I love MI but these gold numbers on the Jerseys are so tacky,2
Enough of the slow balls Boult!,1
Incoming 100(59) innings from Warner to prove everyone wrong,3
Warner bhai needs to play Bhai innings today. Otherwise we are done today.,2
"Manish Anna, we r depending on you.",5
Intent,2
"To all supporting Hyderabad, relax! You have 9 wickets left, 9!! The game is basically won by you nowüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëèüèΩ",-5
Wish Pandey traded his batting form for taking that great catch,2
This is the kind of pitch Specialist Fielder‚Ñ¢ feasts upon. The closest to his home.,15
Warner and de Kock get along now?,7
Prediction : Warner will shake off the jittery form and score a hundred before second Ceat Strategic Timeout.,4
Waiting for comments : Kane should replace warner as a captain.,13
Pandey plays well in the power play and doesn‚Äôt need balls to get going,1
MS Dhoni again ...,7
Warney 35(36) incoming,8
pnadey need a 100,2
Shot manish,1

Damn Boult bowling like a Ranji bowler,1
"Slow balls one too many
YJB couldnt sense them wtf",3
Come on Boult get it rifht,1
"Pulled that well, trying to hit the ball low. Good batting Pandey",2
"If pandeyji wins this one I'd never shit on him again ever, i swear!",5
Pandey and Williamson are in good form here,1
Bring in Bumrah now and watch Warner dance all over the place,2
Pandey has dropped the specialist fielder tag. This IPL he is only specialist batsman,2
Bumrah hasn‚Äôt even bowled yet lol,2
Boult bowling slower balls with new ball is just sad,2
I don't know why but of all the commentators I have Rohan Gavaskar the most.,1
pandey looks like he is good touch. Need a big patnership,3
I can see ma boi Kanos getting out cheaply on this gift of a wicket. He has a knack of missing out on easy runs. Pandey-Warner partnership is the most important now.,5
Bumrah now?ü§îü§´,1
That was a good over but Boult is still not as good as  he could be.,2
Dhoni count: 3,7
Seems to be a strategy from SRH. Davey plays till 20th and everyone around him goes full nagasaki.,1
damn Sandeep has nice eyes,0
[deleted],1
Warner the impasta,3
Bumrah needs to get the next over. Can't hold back your best bowler during the PP,1
Warner looks out of form. Rip. We're done for this game.,-1
Lost in Sandeep's eyes there,6
SAFE AS HOUSES I LOVE THAT SAYING,2

"In 5 Matches, Mumbai has made only one change I believe - Tiwari ‚û°Ô∏è Ishan",7

I love you bumrah but at the moment I love Warner more,11
"Wanrner Anna wanted that sacrifice, Jhonny obliged. Now pls play like this",8
India's not going to even make semis next WC if Bumrah is in this form,8
Warner was waiting for bowler of his own level to start hitting,14
No live win probability on google for some reason,0

Stop bowling Test Match line and lengths,0
warner garu good batting,5

Pure timing,3
This over is just full of sweely tomed shots,4
This shot from Pandey was SO GOOD,6

Let's be honest to ourselves Bumrah is no more Bumrah of 2016-19. Same Malinga after getting hammered by Kohli In Australia in Record run chase wasn't the same ever. But still he performed well for next 5-6 yrs. So please don't lose hope he will be in Playing 11 for sure for India.,14
KP bowling at 103km h^-1,7

Krunal giving Chikadawa some elite company with those funky glasses.,1
No Warner. Don't look at the bat like that. It didn't do anything wrong,1
Altroz is a bad car,1
Krunal Pandya bowling more Yorkers than Bumrah,1

Krunal Pandey eyeing Nattu's yorker record,2

Krunal Jadhav,4
No way Kurnal isn't on the yorker list,3
RR has the most sixes because they play at Sharjah.,2
Someone shop Swanny busting trashbins on the sidewalk while riding an altroz please.,3
Krunal ‚ÄúJadhav‚Äù Pandya,9
Krunal bowling like that Kachra guy in Lagaan :),14
He should be banned for that action,11
Nice pace variations from KP here,5
"Krunal bought back to build pressure after Bumrah released it by leaking boundaries.

Remember when Pandey used to play for RCB and KKR?,3
Pandya is a medium pacer,1
Fucking start smashing already. Kane is yet to come,1
Krunal's Yorkers > Bumrah Yorkers,5

Last year's Warner could've smashed that last delivery into stands with a reverse sweep,4
FFS bowling Pollard on this ground. Get ready some really slow ones,0
Imma have to agree on the big over,2
With Krunal bowling we'll we really don't need Pollard to share fifth bowlers quota,1
Pollard might actually be effective here,3
Pollard in for medium fast off spin,2
If you are batting with no helmet or cap on you are no different from the 48 old year single accountant who struts out to village cricket on a Sunday...,6

Swann is hilarious lmao,3
Someone calm the retard in the Dugout,2
I just can't get myself to like this Krunal guy. Not commenting on his skills though,3
Why does it look like Pollard is about to give up while doing his run-up and then he bowls amyway,9
Pollard and Russell have such similar run ups,3
Ffs IPL is well and good but with Bumrah bowling like this & T20 WC coming in the nearish futureish (year or so) we‚Äôre in trbl,5
Has Rohit included Pollard over chahar in his fantasy cricket team??,4
Polly trying to distract Warner,2
We need 10 overs 100. MI have really good bowling options,2
That's village,3
"Ohhh my , I thought he is gone",3
Now the scorer has trouble. It was showing Pandey when Warner was facing,2
Hardik wtf,3
Hahahahaha fucking discount Ben Stokes,4
Softdik you utter trash.,5
Cocky Pandya fucking deserves it,10
Hahahahaha,4
Hardik you fucking casual,4
Bowling Polly has the same energy as bowling kanos,4
Lmao wtf was that,3
Careless Hardik üò°,2
Aaj mai karke aaya,6
Needed Manish Pandey to catch that one,6
Nice,3
Ah I see the downvoter is back,6
ffs Pandya,3
quid pro quo,4
Make it count. Make it count.,6
Lmao what was that hardik bhai,5
Smh... Dammit Fuccboi,4
Pandey shouldn't throw away his wicket like this,5
"Everytime Fuccboi drops a catch, it's because of his overconfidence. Because of his obsession to look cool on field..",22
Fielding has been absolute hot steaming trash this season. I've seen so many sitters getting dropped it's unbelievable.,5
"Omg This camera man is so fucking shite, can‚Äôt even see one ball! How the fuck he got this job?",7
Too much of posing is injurious to health HP!!,10
Manish ü§úü§õ Hardik,11
Pollard's bowling is a huge meme,8
flat track bully,3
"Polly with that gully cricket uncle bowling, don't know where the ball goes",8
Wtf are those boo crowd noises,4
What's up with the atrocious fielding this year,3
"Even the scorer can't believe  Hardick dropped that sitter!
P. S. He had already flashed wicket",2
The players are not able to see the ball due to bad camerawork. It‚Äôs not bad fielding /s,7
Fucking remove Karthik from the comm box,5
What is the use of those shades when you are going to drop them and then blame sunlight?,7
"Ball goes straight into dream11 boundary cushion.

Coincidence? I think not.

IPL is fixed",-1
De Cock and Hard dick on the same team? Might have to support MI.,5
Pollard bowling pies and still getting away with it,2
Warner can‚Äôt do shit today,-3
Manish scaring Warner with that run.,6
Wtf is going on XDDD,2
Wtf was that by De Kock üòÇüòÇüòÇ,3
My detective mind says that the downvoter is a MI fan.,-3
"this is a proper entanglement, is it not",2
"If you know it's gonna be a slow pitched delivery outside leg, why would I take the extra run instead of a 6?",3
Hahahahha warner,1
Pollard with that beard looks like one of those unkils who wear their mask on the chin.,7
In B4 hitwicket by Warner,1
Warner is definitely doing a Tewatia here,3
Chitting Hyderbad bought Setting Sun as well to play for them BCCI please investigate,5
Lmao dekock wtf,3
"warner is struggling, will he do tewatia ?",5
Even Pakistan at their worst have fielded better than some of the fielding I've seen this season. It's inexcusable and terrible to watch.,8
Playing for NRR here...,3
Polly baby no more extras pls,6
Noobs playing Sharjah like Dubai.,7
Pandey put the bat inside or dive bc. You could have been out had the ball hit the wicket,2
"Catching has been atrocious this season.

Lack of practice, maybe?",2
Warner is so out of sorts.,7
If Hardik is fuccboi then Manish is sexyboi,4
Krunal bowling quicker than Pollard is peak unpredictability,9
"2 wides, 4 off a dropped catch. Come on MI gotta do better.",3
Wtf they arguing about in comms now,2
"It is I, the serial downvoter. I have no proof, but please downvote this comment to vent your frustrations",-13
"Man, I rate Gayle and Warner to be IPL GOATS. One isn't playing and one isn't playing well. I hope they turn the tables.",7
Cmon polly just bowl spin,2
"*BREAKING NEWS*

My man Chahar is here! He is playing WT20,2
Other than the 2 wides Pollard's over was decent. Especially if there was no drop catch.,9
"Warner absolutely struggling here, I think he's going to pull off a Tewatia.",4
Street smart rahul chahar into the wicket,2
All the spinners bowling with glasses today,5
Why would you not continue with Krunal?,1
"*man fucking his wife*

"Whichever team I have betted on zomato, has lost this IPL. Like I've lost at least 7-8 times. Today I've betted on MI.",20
Game over by 18th. MI batsmen owe me 2 overs of entertainment.,10
"Warner that's a wide, should have left that. Smh.",7
Warner's struggles are monumental here.,5
The best part of warners batting is his running between wickets,4
Can't believe I'm saying this but get Pandya back. Oooff.,4
that was a wide :(,0
On the back of the jersey shouldn't the player name be on the top like in soccer?,6
Virgin van Dijk getting hammered by SRH,18
Why do they hype up the timeout,6
"I feel bad for going on and on about Sharjah, and it's each to their own, but 200 plays 200 time and time again with every ball going for six doesn't make for particularly exciting viewing...",12
"Bruh I have a 4K monitor and the match still looks atleast a 100 times better on my grandparents' 8 year old LED TV.

Fuck you Hotstar.",15
Today is Pandey's day. Pan-Day.,6

"Almost unfair to play in that heat in the sun!

Warner is suffering",12
Hotstar comments are so shit lmao,10
Hardik pandya with that peace tattoo on his neck looks like a basic white girl from California,63
208 feels like 140-150 bc. Not a single ounce of it is gonna be defended.,3
KKR look at this chase. Look how you bungled yours with those shitty strategies.,2
Warner needs to go soon or this is game over for us in the 18th,3
Fuck yeah,2
Warner played similar shot aginst bumrah's first ball,4
"just logged in, why was Krunal edgy and visibly pissed?",3
"To SRH credit they haven't let the RR creep too much out of control, this is still do able..",4
Short ball or slower ball incoming,3
"Sometimes I feel like watching cricket religiously is bad for my health. Watching Pandya drop the sitter which would result in the wicket of Pandey, now I will watch Srh go on to win the game easily and as an MI supporter I'll keep thinking of ""What ifs"" and this and that, not be able to study, and forget that it's tough out there and it's largely a game of luck as well. We can support our teams only this much and and let go of the rest of the results.",7
Glorious Square cut by Warner!,4
"Warner ain‚Äôt scaring me anymore

I like that",5
There's no excitement for 4s and 6s if they come every other ball. Warne was right,2
Should've continued with Krunal,1
even with warner struggling we are having a nice run rate,5
"Warner rox, MI shox.",4
"Every match on this ground feels like an RCB match, no total is safe!",12
"I am looking at the score now, but Mumbai sending Hardik before Pollard will cost them at some point. 28 (19) is just not good enough strike rate at this ground from someone like Pandya. Pollard is in tremendous form and I don‚Äôt get why MI is obsessed with Hardik.",10

Time to get rahul chahar to bowl.,3
Pattinson‚Äôs tongue roll while run up is a strategic decision to distract warner,4
It's been great matches for SRH so far,-2
Pandya take notes,1
Brilliant Patto!,2
Pattinson coming in clutchhh,1

Now it's time for simps to take over the match thread,2
Pandey is never playing a long innings even after getting off to a good start. We're better off playing youngsters ahead of him,0
fixer is gone,-2
"**9.5** Pattinson to Pandey, OUT, that is a nothing shot out of nowhere. Length ball outside off, on-pace, and he decides to go in the air but there is no anger behind the shot. When you go in the air, when long-off is back, pack a punch in the hit. He has chipped it straight to the man **94-2**

Congratulations MI.... Packup bois,3

"Usually I‚Äôd be mad at Pandey, but he played his part and had a decent strike rate. Good cameo",10

"Lmao Warner playing wide balls to prove a point.

Keep your ego aside Davey",1

Why tf would Pandya go round arm when he's bowling decently,4
"God I hate the pandyas, how fucking cocky they come off as",7
Hahaha,1
Lol.. Warner showing discount Santner who the true boss is..,4
I'm almost always very jittery until Kanos reaches double digit. He's very prone to get out on rubbish balls on single digit figures.,1
Wtf? I thought Warner debuted much earlier than 2011. Feels like he‚Äôs been around forever,6
"WTF is that action, Krunal?",4
"Bowl shit, get hit.",8
That stupid action deserved the beating,10
Dude it‚Äôs not even funny Krunal,7

Bye bye MI,1
Someone gotta tell KP that he's not a medium pacer.,6
Well most people think ipl is scripted after that betting scandal. Thanks to CSK and RR.,2
Just bowl normally you stupid shit,9

Typical Krunal - sets the field on off side ostensibly and then bowls on the leg,3
We really need 1-2 wickets here like right now,3

"3 ways Kanos gets out early in his innings.


1. Prod forward softly on forward defense and get caught behind.

2. Soft flick straight down to short midwicket.

"Shag the pandyas real hard David boi, I need some laughs",3

Mumbai fans saying the match is over for them- we have TMed reverse jinxing. You can‚Äôt beat us at it.,15
I really hope SRH wins though they defeated us in previous encounter.. just because I despise Pandya brothers too much..,0
Terrific field placement,2

"The fact that Dhoni has struck so many deals and has acted in so many ads (new ones) makes me wonder if he had always planned to retire just before the IPL. There is an ad on ""retirement"" too. Surely they couldn't have shot all this during the pandemic, not definitely after he announced his retirement, at least.",16

Warner needs to stay in there till the end,8
Need a couple 15 run overs here,6
Top 5th bowler has only 5 wickets. This IPL is all about batting.,4
Warner showing Kane how to hit those,5
"Kanos - She loves me, she loves me not, She loves me, she loves me not... OUT.",13
"Middle order has to perform again.

Especially excited to see samad. He is known for his 6 hitting abilities after all",9
"Rohit has to find 3 overs from Krunal, Chahar and Pollard. 

We‚Äôre fucked",8
Warne : Stoinis :: Sivaramakrishnan : Chahal,6
You Have been WARNED,5
That's how you play a slower ball,0
"Underrated Opinion: Now that having watched IPL without Manjrekar as Commentator. I feel bad for him when he got fired, I was happy but I loved how easily he took it and said '' we indians don't take cricticism of our players lightly"". Imagine firing Akash Chopra and Irfan Pathan. It's gonna be blood bath.",10
"Idolo gonna take SRH home and establish his name as the IPL GOAT, isn't he",6
Bumrah's 2 overs will be so crucial. He's been hit or miss this tournament which scares me,5
what a shit ball. Released pressure,2
"86 off 42 at Sharjah should be easy. But with 3 overs to come from Krunal, Pollard/Chahar should be done in 6 overs really.",5
Want kl to spank csk's ass today,9
Legend says 'Biryani By Kilo' was Rohit Sharma's nickname growing up.,3
I have full faith in Warner,6
It‚Äôs genuinely 50-50 right now,6
Warner is gonna win it for us ü§û,4
"What is an achievable run rate for last 5 overs under pressure, 13/14?",5
"The disrespect to Warner una, Man's been carrying this team since forever. Warner > Williamson any day.",7

Damnit Kanos why? Hope Warner clutches this with Garg.,6
Serial downvoters should get a life TBH,11
[deleted],8
Garg vs Spinner Pollard,8
Look at that big man run,5
[deleted],3
"Smart captaincy from Rohit, keeping the leggie away from left hander. Trying to use up his best bowlers to get Warner out. If he survives, the game is over anyway, which would have been the case even if Rahul bowled to him",14
Great running,7
"Man, having to run up to the stumps after every ball to collect the throw in this heat just seems like an elaborate way Satan may be torturing the WKs",7
"The holy Trinity of Garg, Abhishek and Samad",14
Pollard looks extra big while bowling,8
RCB has the best jersey. Don't@me.,5
Pollard runs like an elephant,10
Indian commentators pronouncing Indian names like a Western person would is my pet peeve,31
"Look at The commitment, man gives 200%.",20
pollard is the human version of a stacked batmobile.,30
Nothing beats that tumble from Pant yesterday,7
Ishan Kishan looks like a fuck boi,16
Smart running by warner,11
"David Warner Dives

Commentators: Let me jerk off please",11
"Warner is up there with Sachin, Dhoni, ABD and Kohli when it comes to running between the wickets",14
Garg is good but Samad should've come in now to smoke em. Bumrah could've been handled better by Garg,0
A lot of working out with his wife üòè,7
Garg looks like Kamran Akmal in that grill,3
Kumble's slower ones used to be faster than Pollard's quicker ones.,22
Kane has a serious problem with over 5-6th stump bouncers. Just getting exposed again and again,4
"Look at those beautiful Bois, wish you guys staying in the crease long,smh",7
Garg... Polly is a slow bowler...,9
"Need a 20 run over real soon, but not in sight.",6
Manish+Johnnyüòòü§≠,4
[deleted],15
Pollard is a very smart bowler,11
Why can't they prepare for Pollard's slower ball? He is not that quick anyway for a variation,5
Pollard can do nothing wrong,4
Lmao 'Dodgy Mustache',2
Warner Anna gattiga Dengu aa ball ni neeku dandam pedta,3
Excellent over from Pollard here,1
I fucking despise Pollard's bowling but he's such an effective T20 bowler man. Infuriates me lmao.,6
We badly need a boundary here.,7
Man Swanny is such a great addition to comm box. Pure English banter without being disrespectful. Rare ‚ù§Ô∏è,8
"lil Warner has to carry the innings like usual.

Needs to bat till the end. Garg should be seeking the boundary",4
Pollard doing a great job for MI.,6
Jai jai polly,6
MI has a slight edge at the moment,8
"Listening to Siva after a long time. Jeez, still unbearable.",5
Polly almost pulled off a Polly,9
Man slower balls are such a bitch,8
"Stopped 3 runs, wtf. Man doesn't feel a thing",11
Check the ball if it's damaged üòÇ,13
BIG BOY,6
Boy if he'd caught that...,6
Pollard saved a sure boundary,6
Haha Pollard is greatüôåüèΩüòÜ,8
Pollard seems like two guys running at once,5
Just 7 off the over.,3
That ball went flying after it hit his hand lmao,5
A certain boundary saved by pollard,4
"Presure on Garg, if Warner's out we're in danger",3
"That looked very painful, but then these guys got used to it",2
Baby you are my CVV I am your OTP üòÜüòÜüòÜ,7
Pollard is a beast.,1
That over was a steal,1
Decent from Pollard,1
Hand of pollard,1
Polly please retire,1
"By the way things have gone for SRH, soon Warner is going to take over as Chief Minister of TS and AP.",7
2 overs coming from Krunal and Pollard lol.,4
All I want is six 6s,3
Krunal against Warner nooooooo,3
I think pollard will be the key. His balls have to be timed perfectly to go to the boundary.,2
The ball slit into two when pollard smashed it with his palms,2
"Rohit has to find 2 more overs from somewhere. Surely Krunal and Pollard, ?",0
Pollard is bowling so brilliantly man. Trent Boult surely the best bowler today tho for MI.,2
"15 runs of last two over, MI pulling it back",0
Fucker swatting it like a fly,1
Pollard is such a big unit. Trying to intimidate Garg. LOL,3
I would have bowled Chahar instead of Krunal,1
Pandey‚Äôs drops and Kaul‚Äôs final overs come back haunting,1
"I know he's your brother Irfan but asking SRH management to make Yusuf Pathan the captain as well as head coach is a bit too much, isn't it?",3
"""Do that again. I dare you...I double-dare you mothafuckaa.."", Pollard to Garg.",3
This needs to be a big over for SRH,4
Why the fuck vi adds are same old about empowering people through Internet. Jio has done that,3
I am surprised at how everyone is quick to pile on Rohit and Tiwari for being fat but no one mentions Pollard,1
Mishra would've plastered his hand if he stopped the ball like Polly did,6
What is Pollard made of? Jeez. That sure would have broken my hand,7
"Pollard talking to Garg, Garg would not have a clue what he's saying",6
Why don't they bring Danny Morrison to the Dugout? He'll be so entertaining to watch.,4
I‚Äôm sure garg would prefer going hard now and getting out of be it than Warner get out and have to support the innings all the way through,9
"79 in  36, yeah SRH isn't really known for big chases",1
WHAT A CATCH,2
Wow,2
Jeebus christ how did he take it?,4
"Great, now leave it to Abhishek Sharma",4
Ffs its full toss,6
Chahar my man!,4
YESSS BOY,3
Out!! Fucking yaas!üôåüèΩüôåüèΩ,3
Rahul Chahar redeemed all the shit fielding done today,7
Fuck,2
"Changes the game from now, we are losing.",2
Cameraman is absolutely shit,16
Chahar redeemed for his bad over. What a catch!,5
This can still get interesting,0
"Take a shot everytime someone calls him ""Kunal"" Pandya.",4
"Full toss cohldnt be put away in this ground off a slow ball

Hmmmmm",4
Great catch,3
It's slipping away :(,5
Cameraman made me think it went out of the ground,7
Cameraman made it look too difficult,4
I fucking hate Krunal Pandya,8
SRHHHHH PLS COME THROUGH,2
Getting out to a full toss in Sarjah should be punishable by 10 whiplashes.,6
Nice catch ChaharüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ,2
Treading beautifully,2
What a catch,4
camera man seems to be an intern for this match.,3
That‚Äôs out,0
I think his ponytail touched the rope.,7
Imagine if his ponytail touched the boundary lmao,5
What if his pony touched the boundary rope,10
I don‚Äôt think we are going to win.,1
That's great awareness. Rahul has never been an above average fielder for us tho,5
That is so close,4
You saw that fuccboi?? Take notes.,8
"Lol it's Sharjah.. As long there is one batsman still standing, chasing team always has a chance",1
Polly kaka is the real life Terminator. Any normal human being would have had his palm detached.,3
"They'll lose more wickets, look like losing...Rashid will come , hit a few lusty blows ...give us hope and MI will prevail finally",3
Soft signal is such a stupid concept,7
I can‚Äôt believe he didn‚Äôt touch the rope,8
Are we all ready to shit on CSK next match?,15
"*Indian player takes a catch with fingers pointing towards the sky*
Gavaskar: wait that's illegal",22
Imagine if his pony tail touched the boundary lol,9
Dugout commentators are pissed by the third umpires lol,5
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",3
Cameraman is getting fired for sure,6
Did the pony tail touch the boundary?,14
The umpire wants to see the ponytail lol,6
YESSS WICKEY,0
"Amazing catch.

Scenes if the pony tail had actually touched the Boundary Rope lmao.",13
amazing catch,4
Someone please beat the shit out of kurnal over,2
Longer ponytail and it would've been six.,7
Harshal Patel and Russell last night and today Pollard. I think medium pace and lots cutters are the way to bowl at Sharjah.,2
That would have been six if he had a longer ponytail lol,9
Can someone do the math and tell me if we can still enter playoffs after losing this match?,1
Chad chahar,3
FFS he doesn't touch it,1
Krunal you chut,2
"Swann: ""Did his ponytail flick the boundary?"" ü§£ü§£ü§£",6
"SRH really need to win this, gonna hurt alot üòû",1
"Alright bois. SRH is good for a 170-180 chase and this is too steep for them atm. Time to take a break, get my coffee and prepare for MSD praising. Need a lot of caffeine for that.",7
Warner this is your bitch ... Bang,1
Please man whoever comes next tank some sixes and let Warner take the charge.,3
LMAO NOT THE PONYTAIL,3
Krunal Wideya,4
Soft signal is there because what will you do if cameraman is looking elsewhere?,4
"**14.1** KH Pandya to Garg, OUT, smart catch by Chahar at deep square leg. Just an example of how small the ground is. This is a terrible mis-hit to a full toss, but the top edge carries to the boundary. Chahar takes his overhead and to his left, and he is a couple of yards off the fence so he can go down and roll safely. The third umpire confirms that **130-4**

PK Garg c Chahar b KH Pandya 8 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 114.28",1
Hotstar buffering on jatin's phone lmao,2
SRH don't use Samad's batting well,6
Warner please stay till the end.,1
csk ded today methinks,1
Serious question: If his hair touched the boundary is it 6?,4
Warner taking it Deep today,3
Lmao Krunal talking to Boult in hindi? üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠üò≠üòÇüò≠üò≠,21

C'mon Warner hit a switch hit to these wide deliveries,1
Krunal pandya would be the perfect choice for a vimal ad,10
SRH's final hope is Warner and his 80s ~~moustache~~ porn-stache,3
Warner will gang bang the sole team today,6
Dafaq Pandya with your wides,2
Abhishek using his bat from 2015.,5
[removed],5
Cant remember when the last boundary came,2
SRH made a mess of the 3 overs MI had to find.,6
love watching warner run between the wickets,4
"SRH is going to really struggle if they don't develop a strong Indian core. As of now, they're dependent on their four foreign players and Injureshwar Kumar for everything.",9
Abhishek smashhh it boiii,2
How many wides?,4
Why the fuck Krunal can't bowl normally ffs,9
laudu is scoring more in wides than his own batting.,5
"Abhishek immediately trying to hit from ball one, love it",2
"Arre pandi, stop bowling wide ffs",4
Pandya tries too many wierd stuff,3
Krunal Pandya's wide yorker tactics need better execution,3
Krunal bowling these Yorkers after Yorkers,4
Whats with Krunal & his wides? Too cheeky?,1
Krunal bowls more wides than the rest of the MI bowlers combined.,6
ffs Krunal,2
Jeez that's just 4 balls,2
[removed],9
What bowling is this lol. Absolute trash and effective,10
Tank some mate,2
Is he scared of 20 year old?,2
Only SRH can score 2s on this ground,9
"Play for NRR boys, its over.",1
Any question you ask about Hardik Pandya will be answered by ‚ÄúBig dick energy‚Äù,6
9 runs off this over without any effort and only wides.,7
Such a shite camera work even the commentators in the dugout are not sure whats it going to be,9
Wide better than 6,5
Please get Warner so I can breathe easy,4
"Remember when punjab won their 1st 5 matche and still didn't make it to playoff and MI lost their 1st 5 matches and won the IPl? 

Lesson: Anything can happen if you are MI or CSK. :P


Just a joke guys don't downvote me.",16
Every where fielders,2
Warner it is then,5
I swear dhoni live in every commentators head rent free,6
"**Just in from Sharjah** -

Pollard taken of the ground because of some heavy rashes on his inner thighs.",8
"Warner being betrayed by all his batting partners, hope Abhishek sticks around till the end with him",3
Krunal Pandyaü§™üòÇüòÜ,1
Lmao Pathan talking about Dhoni again üòÇüòÇ,3
Yorker game on point,3
Krunal fuck you.,2
Siddharth Kaul won 48 Fantasy points despite conceding 64 runs,9
"don't bowl Chahar at all, and let Pollard bowl the last over.",2
MI don't have any weakness,6
I hate Krunal Pandya so much,9
Fack,2
Krunal Pandya is on Drugs - Arnab Goswami,3
Krunal is a genius with these wide Yorkers,7
Still one over of Pollard left,2
"Lol chill man, Krunal",9
We need a separate krunal pandya bowling action hate thread,6
Krunal being jassi,5
Its shit but it works,10
That was a pretty good over.,4
"No one

Krunal after not bowling a wide :üò†üëèüëè",25
This is so messy,5
2 of these 5 overs are by Bumrah,4
Warner is so done with Krunal's shit,6
So that was what he was trying to do all over,6
"Pandya reminds me of the movie 300, but the athenes, not the spartans.",5
Kurnal and his over the top reactions.,6
70 off 30 is perfectly chaseable. 55-45 to Mumbai,3
shit gets wickets I guess,5
When will SRH get a pinch hitter in their middle order? ):,3
Thats a wide,1
"Cunt antics by Krunal as usual. Win this thing Warner ,want to look at his stupid face",11
"David Warner wants to ""take it deep"" like the wounded Lion",3
Krunal Pandya acting like he got Virat Kohli out after he finally bowled a non wide ball,10
wonder if umpires actually matter,3
"Pandya basically wanted to risk wide runs but not let them hit boundaries, bold strategy but it worked",4
Krunal Pandya is like Mushfiqur Rahim in celebrating too early üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,2
Krunal is going to be the difference it seems,3
Krunal you're a spinner what's up with that aggression,3
I am sure MI fans think of Krunal as a cunt but their cunt,4
"5 overs 70 odd runs, easy peasy for SRH If Warner will stay till the end",2
Pandya bros go out of their way to act like snobs,7
Krunal is such an annoying player,6
Krunal is sasta bhajji,6
If SRH pull this off we'll see a Warner 100. No other way they get this. He looks determined to get there too,5
SRH seriously under use Rashid's batting.,6
"Should have taken Nabi. He bowls well and could have prevented 5-10 more runs. He is also a power strikers.

I love Kane but we must prevent silly errors.",3
If we don't tonk pollard we're done,5
70(30) needed. Reminds me of one of my favourite T20 innings for India.,16
They are saving Pollard for the last over oof,6
"**Just Wide** is not a bad tactic, because it messes with the batsman, he knows a little inside and it would be a dot ball",2
[removed],13
Looks like Akshay Kumar's patriotism finally paid off.,3
IDK what MI fans are complaining about; this was a good over and wides were a part of unsettling the batsmen,11
Krunal is a fierce competitor. All passion and none of the bullshit that Hardik does.,8
Warner getting trolled by spinners and his own teammates!,6
[deleted],5
I wish I could celebrate little joys in life like Krunal celebrates dot balls.,7
My favourite thing about Mumbai‚Äôs jersey is how much Pattinson gets to abuse the collar zipper,6
I‚Äôd rather Krunal bowl 2-3 wides than get tonked for 6,8
I'm expecting a 6 this over,2
cant lose with such platform that too chasing par score of 200 in shj,6
Wtfü§£üòÜüòÜ,3
That's the 'Shilajit Gold - Relive your manlihood' game changing moment right there.,3
should have sent samad or rashid instead,4
warner getting ambitious,3
Struggling to hit boundaries in this ground,10
Stop with the funky shots Warner,5
Kaul was very expensive and that last over might have cost the game,4
42 balls in and he's trying such shots,5
I know Warner has scored runs but boy he's struggling,8
Murli Kartik Cringe Leve Max,3
Warner Anna,3
David Warner,1
Warner is gassed,2
Still chaseable if Warner can hit some,1
"Warner is a small man with short arms... those wide deliveries are hard to reach for him.

Not fair.",4
"Pollard 
Bumrah
Boult 
Bumrah",3
"Fielder, fielder, everywhere, not a boundary to hit",3
Everybody wants to be abd when they actually are maxwell,6
"The SRH batsmen are just unable to pick the lengths. Sad to watch this. Kishan, Sky, etc., did that so beautifully.",6
Warner bhaijaan ye kya hai,3
Abhishek needs to do a tewatia now,2
Why is Krunal so animated today. Did he read some mean tweets or something?,6
damn MI snapped,1
Plss hit a boundaryüò≠,2
Fuck yes!,3

"Yeah, we're done here.",2
"Thats huge, it was already slipping away from SRH but thats a game changer",9
Game over,1
I am in Love,3
Lol. SRH in the mud,1
Man who thought he'd lost all hope loses last additional bit of hope he didn't even know he still had,6
why srh's batting is so useless,0
Mumbai and Hyderabad captains getting out on an almost wide,4
SRH just lost 8 wickets in one ball.,4
60 of 43 is below average on this ground. Puts pressure on every other batsman.,2
Good night,3
SRH need some ruthless hitters. Otherwise they are better off batting first,4
That fly wasnt needed but good catch,1
"Honestly he looked tired, no power at all.",2
Fuck this shit,2
That‚Äôs the game for us,1
Lmao why is Warner chasing so many wides,3
Euthanised Warney,1
Someone explain this fair play award system,2
Game over,-1
Thats the game,2
Why does he even go for the wide ones?,2
"Sorry, I know r/cricket loves Kane but seriously can‚Äôt see Nabi in the bench.

We are fuckin crippled with our bowling lineup.",7
GONE. GET OFF THE PITCH.,0
Absolute disasterclass that innings from Warner,4
MI is just too good for SRH,1
Warner saved MI 10 extra runs going for wides,8
"It's our game now, boys!",3
"Warner should have left that , that was going to be a wide",3
Boys let's do this,1
"The bowling hasn't been that good but we're still getting wickets, whatever works I guess.....",2
that's a proper keeper's catch,6
"Boult got Williamson out, Pattinson got Warner out. It‚Äôs the battle of the national teammates",6
Lmao fuck all the salty fans in this thread pissed at MI and Krunal.,-1
This is the worst Warner's innings I've ever seen tbh.,-2
"Pattinson has been so good for MI, didn't expect that",1
60(44) is selfish but that‚Äôs the only hope SRH had tbh after Bairstow and Kane failed,1
MI fielding has been outstanding,1
"Warner had played 10 plus wides today, I believe. 

And eventually that ends him. Poetic.",2
Welp there goes the game for SRH,-1
Fuck yes!!!!!!!!,1
"This year MI team is OP. 

Strongest in recent years?

Mind you MI have 2 titles in 3 years",0
Ishan acting like it was the greatest catch in the world,6
"Ok, mental note to bowl at Sharjah

Bowl wide",0
Another garbage innings from Warner that will look good on paper - 2019 world cup all over again. Match was over as soon as Bairstow got out,-1
"boult get williamson

patterson gets warner.",7
"Shite innings, good for his confidence and maybe NRR",0
Mumbai don't slack off like you did in KKR match.,1
"Okay Irfan unzipping rn

Lets see what this Samad is all about",1
Cameraman can't even point to correct umpire,5
"Abhishek, Samad and Rashid. Need 11 sixes in 26 balls",-1

"**15.4** Pattinson to Warner, OUT, that might be the game. Slower short wide ball legcutter. If Warner doesn't play it, this will be called. But he goes after it, and gets thick outside edge that lobs to the right of short third man where Kishan takes a superb diving catch **142-5**

DA Warner c Ishan Kishan b Pattinson 60 (44b 5x4 2x6) SR: 136.36",2
Cut my nuts off and call me Liz Hurley but that was a good catch!,0
[deleted],13
"First ball I tune in, Warner gets out lmao",2
Ok now lets target NRR,5
Warner's score won't show you how much he actually struggled today. Still did well to not get out.,4
Catches win matches especially since teams are dropping many this year.,7
We can win this,3
"It's all over , bad batting performance again.",2
Abhishek will pull a tewatia,0
I will still not say it's over have learned that this IPL,2
Abhishek 50(20) please,6
SRH just get to 200 FFS because that Sharjah record needs to continue.,7
So.. how long do you reckon Karthik was waiting to drop that Ivan Lendl tennis reference?,2
This is Sharjah. I'm still scared. Never unclench at Sharjah,2
KXIP batting,-3
"Idc if we win now, lost all hope

Just wanna see samad hit sixes",0
Who‚Äôs downvoting everyone?,-4
"Samad, please save us boi",7
That was the sexiest catch I‚Äôve ever seen,1
LMAO where's that guy who predicted that Kaul will outscore Bairstow and Wanrner??  ü§£ü§£ü§£,10
I wonder if SRH will get to 200,4
"Kaul strike rate of 42.9, I think he's got his batting and bowling mixed up",0
60(44) is unforgivable on this ground,25
If these Youngsters win this match for SRH today. Not this IPL for next 5 yrs SRH will easily qualify for Knock-outs.,9
"Selfish innings from Warner,  didn't play shots.  
Bowlers did excellent job of saving 20 runs.",5
"MI - We will give you some free runs bro.

Warner- No.

MI - Atleast one wide in an over.

Warner - No.",21

Warne‚Äôs short arms can barely reach for them.",3

This is why ROHIT SHARMA is the #1 Captain in India rn.,3
Pattinson has been fantastic for us,2
Off topic . is special ops any good ?,-2
Update- Punjab batting first. Another thala chase incoming bois,13
Come on lads. Steady head and don't let your guards down. But what do I know. I shat on Tewatia endlessly and ended up the way it did.,-1
MI and SRH are making this ground look more bowling friendly than it is,10
Rohit with these bowling changes has low-key won us the game,9
Do you think SRH would be able to chase down 209?,-5
[deleted],-2
Why do the make the colors of the bowlers the opposing team colors in the bowling scorecard?,3
"Idiots, don't say wHo's dOwNwOtInG. They're not gonna tell you, and you're only making it worse. Stop feeding the trolls",6
"SRH 

I, one of the dwellers of Sharjah thinks it's possible",3
Siddarth Kaul Man of the Match,15
Rohit is actually a really smart captain,22
Warner hit so many balls that would have been wide lol,16
4 off the over. Nice!,7
Krunal frustrated Warner with all the wide-ish deliveries and really built the pressure. Street smart.,11
Heat plays a good role. Foreign players aren‚Äôt used to this type of heat in the evening. Indian players are. That‚Äôs why almost all mind boggling innings on Sharjah this season have come from Indian players,2
Csk bowling and going with an unchanged team.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,8
Srh might be the first team to not get 200 here,8
"Wtf wrong with this year's ipl? They have to score 66 of 25 and they still won't be considered out of this match. Any other ipl, the match would be done",8
"Warner let pressure get to him, so many wide valls messed with",2
Now I'm genuinely scared,2
Crushing hard on Pattinson,6
Massive overachievement if this SRH can make it into top 4,3
"65 off 24 with two overs of Bumrah. Need 4 sixes of Bumrah's two overs, 5 sixes off other two overs. Then singles and doubles should win it",4
"Warner could have attacked early on, each wicket fell while playing big shots.  
60 of 44 on Sharjah is poor",3
">**Harsha**: Pattinson and Nortje have been such outstanding replacement decisions. First saw Pattinson as a young man in Australia and was impressed by his unrelenting pace and aggression. Many injuries later, he still has the same approach. Excellent pick.

""Many injuries later"" hit me hard",9
I'm supportive but haven't seen many miracles so have nothing to say,5
"Pattinson has been brilliant so far. 

Yet another top recruit from the MI management.",8
[deleted],7
"SRH always relied on their bowling to be able to restrict the opponent to surprisingly low scores and then had Warner and a bunch of others chase them down. It worked with Fizz, Rashid, Bhuvaneshwar, Nabi, and occasionally others like Boult and Sandeep chipping in.   

I don't think this bowling attack is made for this line up. SRH seems to have slipped into the old RCB lane, and it has taken RCB years to even show positive signs towards coming out of struggling with the bowling.",2
"It's 7, will we see mi Vs SRH taken off broadcast so that Csk can be praised in pre match show",9
[deleted],-1
"I hate how people ask to drop YJB over Kane. Like come on guys, it‚Äôs not like either is doing significantly worse or better than the other.

Realistically YJB needs to be in the squad over Kane.

At Sharjah consider dropping Kane and play Nabi. Other grounds we can go back to the same idea.",0
srh has been shit this season,2
Man abhishek & samad should atleast try,-1
Can't even go *woh raat apun do baje tak piya* because this shit is not possible at home. This is depressing.,8
"Warner is proving to be another Dhawan, loads of runs with low strike rate",3
We need Jason holder for a match or two in place of warner/ Kane to strengthen overall team it seems...,1
KXIP have top 2 run scorers and are 7th,3
Rohit‚Äôs captaincy (bowling changes) will win us this game.,5
If this Sharma guy gets going they might be able to win it,5
Cousin called me at the wrong time. What's going on with the chase? Who's winning?,0
"I think all that the MI bowlers are practicing in nets is how to bowl a wide. (well, on the wide line)",6
Irfan pathan was throwing shade on Dhoni in dugout and they removed him before it was time to change. Lmao,12
The way Rohit has rotated his bowlers today has been brilliant.,6
Is bowing wide deliveries a new strategy in death bowling?,1
SRH haven‚Äôt hit a boundary in so long,2
Rohit is one of the best limited overs captain. Today I'm proved right again.,3
Can we keep the Quantum of Loss‚Ñ¢ under 25?,4
Spitting in the dugout.. so village from Warner.,5
Yes bowl wideüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ,0
How slow does Bangar speak,3
Why aren't they picking thampi? Come on he can't be worse than kaul.,2
"Ever since deccan chargers days, the hyd team has been bad at getting Indian talent in the batting department. Only Rohit and then dhawan are the only good batsmen they've had. Everyone else got so many opportunities but none could do anything. 

Viabri, naman ojha, so many others trash batsmen also.",2
This wide bowl strategy working really well for MI. Guess more teams will use this especially in this ground.,7
"lmao, last boundary in the fucking 13th over. Can‚Äôt believe I support a joke team who are chasing 200 and think they‚Äôre playing a test match.",9
Williamson wicket was the turning point,4
Stop hitting wode balls,2
"Keeping playing wide balls, morons.",2
Warner to get fined because of spitting?,2
"What an opportunity lost by SRH, they were cruising after the first 10 overs, just had to avoid dot balls and hit one four per over. Good bowling & catching by MI.",5
Meanwhile CSK will play with an unchanged squad.,2
Finally someone let the wide go ffs,2
Rashid might be the saver in this ground,4
Wide again?,1
[removed],15
WideüòÇüòÇ,0
SRH can't even score a boundary,3
Who is on commentary with doully? is it rohan?,2
"Doull, anyone who has seen Rohit captaincy knows Pollard will bowl the 20th over.",8
Feels like it's been ages since the last boundary,12
Most of our runs in the past few overs are literally from extras,2
Fuckin A what a shot!,6
Holy,3
Is the cameramana sitting in the last row in the stands?,3
Is a tewatia possible now?,1
Fuck that 6 has me worried again,7
"SRH lost when Willimadad got out cheaply. They have no domestic lower order talent.

Edit: That was good 6 tho",5
Samad goooooo boyyyyyy,3
Rahul Tewatia moment,2
It's all over. Cant hit 60 in 20. We can lay for net runrate. Fielding and poor batting lost us the match. Only Kaul bowled badly,5
Oh Samad! What a hit.,3
One more samad,2
See that? Should've come in ahead of Garg and broke the chase a bit. Now he has to go every ball,7
First boundary in 23 balls,2
Thats a shot and a half,3
Are we seeing tewatia,3
can these kids do it ?,7
"Thats it, nrr we are coming to you",7
'Bumrah to the cleaners'? Banger just getting to idioms on his English lessons is he?,4
Yessssssss,2
"No Tewatia, no party",4
Abdul samad looks like he doesn't give a shit cool.,8
Lord tewatia moment incoming....,7
Beautiful!,2
"If Samad and Sharma pulls it off, it would be a great thing for Indian cricket.",6
RR needed 51 off the last 3 when Tewatia happened.,6
Every single ball a wide eh?,2
Fuckkkk 51 off 18,2
Dhoni: I think we have played decent cricket. lol,3
Bumrah has bowled utter garbage today. SRH missed a trick by not twatting him in his 2nd over. Williamson particularly.,2
It's a Win boys,2
this is so disrespectful to bumrah üò≠üò≠,0
Trying to hit those 5000 wide balls lost us,3
"Honestly it‚Äôs an easy solution.

All they have to do is convince Rashid to get Indian citizenship. Then, both Kane and Bairstow can play. 

Not sure why it‚Äôs taking them so long to try that",37
I‚Äôm going Boult Pollard Bumrah here,2
SRH were 109 in 11 overs they seriously choked it here. Although it's not over yet,4
Fuck I am afraid for Pollard and Boult over now,3
Samad lowkey reminds me of Ben Cutting,3
Cool cool cool cool cool,1
We need a samadtia now,1
This season for SRH has shown more performance from young Indian batsmen than the past 3 seasons combined.,5
Srh need 9 sixes from 18 balls,3
Guys is Samad from Kashmir????? /s,2
Bumrah's bowling is still a worry for Aussie tour.,3
Bangar should stick to Hindi commentary where he would be able to speak fast,6
"51 off the last 3, seems doable",1
"Still Doable ,if these guys can Tonk the 5th bowler",1
What happened to Bumrah's yorkers?,0
Samad is Kashmiri boy?,3
"Le lower middle order batsman starts hitting the ball when the req. run rate is above 16.

Everyone : Is this a tewatia?",3
51 off 18. They need to hit 2-3 sixes and singles this over followed by atleast 12runs over from Bumrah to be in the game.,2
Pollard to bowl the final over,2
We were cruising and now those 10 runs has me real worried again,5
Rashid can also slog remember,6
Is Krunal better player than Jadeja? His IPL stats definitely make him to be better. Is he international material? His 20(4) was wonderful.,0
Whatever happened to catches at point? I remember when I was a kid fielder's like Azharuddin and Jonty Rhodes used to regularly pull off blinders at point. Are batsmen not cutting ferociously anymore? Or is it the field restrictions?,2
Only smash for now on boys,2
[removed],-4
MI's game to lose from here I reckon. 51 from 3 is still a very tall ask.,4
What a story it would be if these pull it off.,1
Pattinson is MI‚Äôs answer to Doug Bollinger isn‚Äôt he,2
"*1000 to win off 8 balls*  

*Boundary*  

Everyone: Is this Tewatia?",19
"‚ÄúNot often he goes for 14‚Äù

Except for literally his first over in the same match.",10
I wonder if srh could ever do smt with having samad 1 down or smt like that,1
Bumrah smiling like 'aaj Kal ke bacche.. .',4
I wish Rohit would bowl an over. Just want to see him smashed for a 6,5
Samad and Abhi do it lads,2
Saw a comment here that SRH don't have good domestic players. Too harsh to be honest. They have some good players with a lot of potential. Just too many at the same time.,5
Wish some team defends 50 off 30 balls successfully. Too tired of this chasing down 50 off 18 balls shit.,9
Imagine if kaul didn't give that fucking 20 in last 4,7
They should‚Äôve gone for it from the 15th over when the run rate required was around 12,2
Warner stars in ‚Äúnethi meeda gudda‚Äù,5
Only 10-12 runs Boult sa üôè,2

Srh is a great running team. The older players are phenomenal athletes and the young players are...well young,6
"Tewatia can't be repeated, that was special one. It's expecting too much from these young one's. Pandey and Kane should have played with more responsibiliy. Casual batting performance",16
The fucking one ball which is inside the line is the one they leave lmao,19
wide length bowl is killing us,5
Wide Yorkers is Mumbai‚Äôs strategy today. Lots of wides but better than 6,2
Brilliant yorkers by Boult till now,2
"MI ü§ù Bumrah 

Alternating between good and shit",5
What's with the boo sound effect on every dot ball?,3
Boult may just do a Nortje here,2
Warner cosplaying palpatine there,2
Samad hit 2 sixes off 3 balls and we got a match,0
Just start batting 2 feet outside off stump,1
Well left,2
35 off 4 from Krunal is just bullshit from SRH batting,8
Similar to the SRH and CSK match without all the drama.,2
Bowling these wides is a wonderful strategy. You alternate between wide and good balls and the batsman will leave both. So only 6 off the over lmao,6
"Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this, but man Bumrah is becoming a liability.",1
So I am guessing we'll be the first team to not score 200 here,7
So many dote,2

How can you expect our lil boys to finish it ?,4
"Krunal scored 20(4) and gave off 35(24). 

That‚Äôs where the game was lost for SRH.",19
Mumbai have bowled 10 wides but it has also worked in fooling the batsman in leaving a marginally close ball,12
basically srh is playing with only 4 batsman,8
"Apparently samad is 18,wtf? There needs to be a limit even while faking the age,lol",17
Get Vijay shankar in for Abhishek sharma next match,1
Rohit to pay 12 lakh for sure,7
Sid kaul is the difference,8
That is one hell of captaincy by Rohit,5
Finally swanny shilling an IPL team instead of altroz.,6
Still better than watching Thala struggle and smash,3
Boult is a machine,5

Back to back matches is so much fun! Work tomorrow after a long weekend is not so fun!,4
This was a masterclass by Boult. Outwitted the batsmen.,5
Yup seems really hard for SRH now,2
4 runs loool,2
They shouldve sent in Rashid before Abhishek couldve had a chance,2
"Bowl slow, how did Kaul miss that",2
They've let boult get away with just 4 unfortunately,2

CSK and SRH gonna lose all matches at Sharjah.,6
"Now I'll switch to watch kxip batting

What am I doing with my life?",7
I am sorry SRH but this now looks like it's a done deal. Where did it go wrong? When I last watched the game Warner and Pandey were cruising along nicely.,7
Just got inside info that it is asked to not bowl from Hardik since he would be playing for the upcoming Australia and other series. They don't want to risk any injuries,4
Imagine struggling at Sharjah. SRH batting is so ass man.,4
Ok 8 sixes off 12,2

Bumrah getting tonked really hurts :(((,4
"Did say I wouldn't be surprised if they lost by 40,  this team is a joke. 

At least they won twice unlike rcb that is full of batting talent but kohli choked as a team captain.",-1
Should've sent him ahead of Abhishek,3
"Rabada yesterday, Bumrah today. Hate this ground - destroying figures of the best bowlers.",3
What do you guys think abt having samad at 3? In pitches like this,1
Wonder if Kaul had bowled just maybe one decent over things could have been different. He's definitely the outlier among the bowlers today,7
Krunal's innings was the difference,3
Ok boys... good seeing off boult... now get in,1
"Samads taken a liking to bumrah , this is gonna dent bumrahs confidence",3

Rashid will take it home,1
Whatever the outcome of match but Samad has IT,5
Anyone out there still waiting for a miracle?,1
7 sixes off 10 needed,3
You know you've fucked up badly in a chase when Bumrah has conceded 40+ runs and you're still losing the game,3
Time for some Rashid magic??,1
Bumrah has been so erratic this IPL. Needs some more matches to get back to his rythm I feel.,3
Finally a wicket for Bumrah,6
Thank God Bumrah.,4

Huehuehue Sandeep next tewetia confirmed.,4
So MI becomes first team to restrict the opposition below 200 in Sharjah. Proud of my team.,13
Dhoni? Is that you?,5
"Pollard with better performance than most ""all-rounders"".",5
Should‚Äôve scored a few here for the nrr,0
Dude should have taken the single ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø,2
How in the hell was MI able to defend 208 on a high scoring pitch?,11
At least run to increse NRR.,4
Rashid Dhoni Khan,0
Rashid Thala Khan,1
MI will be forever indebted for the service Pollard has provided to the team. Whatta man. <3,17
Lol that's embarrassing,2
Lol SRH NRR taking a massive hit,1
Idk why he didn‚Äôt run.,1
Rashid bhai is absolute chad. love this guy,4
I never doubted my team (except for the 300 occasions when I did ü•¥),10
Imagine scoring less than CSK at Sharjah,13
"MI rolling over another opposition... With QDK and Krunal firing, it is like they've literally checked all the boxes!",6
Lol that is some ego ... Hilarious,8
Rashid doing the work of bumping our NRR....,3
What the fuck is Rashid doing refusing singles at 36+ RRR lmao,3
Plz Rashid just connect lol,3
"If there‚Äôs one team that cannot hit 200 in this ground, it‚Äôs gotta be SRH",3
Rashid got the dots from MS last match. Now he is using those dots himself,4
Feel bad about Rashid Khan. He deserves a better performing team. The guy is a fighter!,10
Bat 1st Strikes again,2
Hope this silences Rashid as opener shippers,7
Pollard you absolute madladüòéüòÜüôåüèΩ,6
Can we atleast witness csk lose yet an another match?,7
Pollard is bowling fire,3
Pollard making life hell for Rashid now üòÅüòÅ,5
Krunal‚Äôs over changed the game.,8
"Sad, very sad",3
FFS nutmegged him üò≠üòÇ,10
RIP NRR,13
Rashid shows middle finger to NRR,31
Holy Shit 4 dot balls,5
Kieron Pollard >> Bumrah,12
"Bumrah is yet to nail his yorkers...he's bowling well, the last wicket was a full toss....he has cutters and length brilliantly this season to get wickets..",3
Embarrassing for rashid.,9
Pollard doing to Rashid what Rashid did to him.,13
SRH can‚Äôt even score 180 on a fucking belter,10
"Polly the death bowler. 

 üòç",13
We threw away the match way too comfortably,12
Bumrah who.,6
Through the legs ho ho ho hoooo :D,2
lol what an ending,7
Loool. Gg rashid,6
[deleted],21
brilliant!,4
NRR ke maa ka.... - Rashid,10
Lol 2 runs off the last over,4
Rashid really turned down singles and then went on to do fuck all in the over lmfao,18
Lol rip that‚Äôs the NRR then,5
Pollard is bowling so calm and perfect,10
Wow,7
Couldn't even hit those NRR runs,9
He still didn‚Äôt run lmao,10
"34 runs
That‚Äôa huuuuuuuge",2
Shit batting after being 109 in 11,8
Ok. That was rubbish batting...,4
Pathetic. Bring in Nabi next time you play at Sharjah.,8
Fucking lost by 34 runs when being 100/1 after 10. Choke,12
How is Polly SO GOOD with a ball I don‚Äôt understand but I love to see it,14
NRR just went up! Great bowling Pollard!,11
Thanks Rashid for helping with NRR.,19
"That's not how you play for NRR, Rashid",10
Reminder that Pollard bowled the greatest death over in Sharjah. You'll never sing about this,34
Guys wtf happened today? I was looking through the scorecard and I saw krunal pandya's strike rate!,27
Good defense. Well played boys! GG!,4
They should remove us from table. We cant play t20 with this lineup,10
Mumbai is studded with match winners. üôà,10
174 is the lowest total is Sharjah by 26 runs. SRH is struggling. Both bowling and batting!,8
This result is a nrr swing of 1.7,7
So NRR isn‚Äôt a thing anymore?,4
Pollard is very intelligent player.,6
Let me guess MI is first now,6
Thank god jeet gaye. I was and am still scared of this ground.,12
Well played Mumbai. Definitely outplayed. Hardluck SRH.,8
lmfao now he looks like a wanker not taking the single,8
Boobie could've won it for us,1
SRH choked,8
Polly just casually bowling as if he's bowling to his kid and conceding only 2 runs lol,25
Hey can we retain the same team for test matches,9
Only 75 runs in the last 10 bruh,13
Slow over rate. Just 4 minutes until next match starts. When am i supposed to take a bath :p,4
Not really a chokejob considering SRH's batting ends after 3 down,17
Spread the word guys. Samad needs to go up if we want to have a successful chase,3
We lost today‚Äôs match in the 19th over vs CSK,18
Sehwag has named him correctly- *Baal Bujurg*.,10
382 runs scored in 40 overs but still looks like batsmen underperformed.,12
Dream 11 game changer is definitely  kaul,5
Rashid on small matter of NRR - I duh wahn it ..,11
"Rashid is so miser with runs, don't want to give any and don't want to score any.",21
Polly > Russel,36
Minnow level performance from SRH. Made Sharjah look like the MCG.,18
Rashid trying to show Sandeep how to play out back to back dots in the 20th over. He was afraid Sandeep might score at 36+ SR and kill the suspense for the latter half of the tournament,14
Sorry but we lost cuz of Kanos,8
Shambolic! Bye.,6
Time to print some missing person posters for Sid Kaul,12
See u guys in csk vs kxip thread,3
Imagine not scoring 200 on Sharjah.,10
"MI with that +1.4 nrr, 2.5 times better than no. 2",17
My favorites team is not doing well imma just go watch my favorite batsman kL bat,6
Man of the match? Where is post match ceremony?,10
" If Williamson doesn‚Äôt fire in next 1-2 games, shaft him. Especially at Sharjah. 

We need a proper 5th bowler. Warner can‚Äôt keep looking around for part-timers.",10
Good night everyone who said it will be a Cakewalk/Easy chase for SRH.,14
Hope they give krunal pandya Mom. He made impact with batting and bowling,11
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",35
"**Only 3 teams never lost a match (After Scoring 200+ in IPL)**

**MI (10/10)**

DC (6/6)

RR (5/5)",18
"Nabi would have actually made a difference, but that's just hindsight. No idea in whose place he would play though.",8
"Pollard respected Rashid, Rashid respected Pollard",84
Why are they filming this with 4k cameras? Is there a service that broadcasts ipl in 4k?,3
[deleted],32
I‚Äôll be really surprised if SRH makes it to playoffs,9
"I was only off by 6 runs of loss by 40, that was when it looked gettable. I know the hyd is chock-full of chokers from a winning position. Both when batting and bowling. Can't score 60 off 36 not defend 80 off 36 lol.",9
This was a disappointing chase from the point where Kanos got out.,11
"I like how people keep bringing up our ‚Äòmiddle order‚Äô as an excuse to keep Kane. Like dude, if he doesn‚Äôt fire in the next 2 games, that‚Äôs 4 successive failures. So basically we should be left with a poor middle order and a poor bowling lineup at the same time? You don‚Äôt think Nabi deserves a chance? Fabian Allen also deserves a chance.",13
Koi post match thread bana re,12
Lol RCB stayed on top for exactly 24 hours,3
Leave this shitshow; let‚Äôs enjoy Rahul and Mayank fight for the orange cap,8
[deleted],4
Is MI at the top of the table now,23
Is there no presentation?,6
"If neither Bairstow nor Kane can prove their worth in the next 3 games, we need to drop one of them.",5
"Kaul has joined the Dinda Academy.
Joining date:4 Oct,2020.
Status:Bowler.
Runs conceded in match:64 at an average of 16.
Titled as  a worse bowler,lucky bowler,least wicket bowler.
Match:Vs MI.",14
"Sunrisers batting is Based on banking the that they top 4 will fire and the the others can finish off. That obviously isn‚Äôt working, Abhishek should be dropped for Shankar, Kane/Bairstow our for Nabi/Holder.",0
We're clearly not a chasing team,10
The only reason we lost this was Kaul and ofc our Batsmen choked,17
This is not a choke guys the one that happened against RCB is a choke.,13
Looks like NZ fans have gone to sleep.,8
No post match thread?,15
"if there was a definition of retarded analysis, ashish nehra has it",22
"If SRH had just let all the wide deliveries be, I reckon they would have won with extras alone.

MI absolutely bowled with a plan of bowling wide off the off stump. And SRH kept fishing everytime.",29
"Nehra in dugout: Replace curran with murali vijay.

Guys am done",36
I had Rohit as Captain and Williamson as VC in fantasy team today. Fml.,20
No post match thread?,7
Mumbai Indians and defending sub-par/under par totals. Tell me a better love story!,15
Remember guys we had a Bipul Sharma or Ben Cutting to hit those essential sixes so the pressure on Warner is relieved! We have a Samad now and we clearly want the other guys to stand up and deliver quicker runs.,14
[deleted],0
[deleted],16
Awful batting.,9
Bishnoi runs weird,3
Who is MOTM,1
Even CSK managed to get 200 at this ground. Poor batting by SRH,12
