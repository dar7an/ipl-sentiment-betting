Umm first I guess.,-1
Predictions?,3
"The games on weekend come so quick, I felt like, I just watched the Mumbai game",8
RR might as well open with tewatia and archer.,6
"If RCB loses today, they'd be fucked up. If RR loses today they'd be super fucked up.",9
"I have a feeling the management will continue with the Stokes - Buttler opening combo so atleast bring in Mahipal Lomror at 5, he's a proper middle order bat and is a handy bowling option too.",7
"AB is better man than I; if it was me, i’d have felt disrespected at what Kohli did in the last match",1
"Does RR have any leg spinner , if not warne can play in place of Smith, kohli will hold back abd and the match is half won already",4
Ready to take the L today as usual,10
My boi tewatia will score century today.,15
supporting rr and dc today.,4
I want RR to win just because of Tewatia.,8
I am supporting RR because I don't want CSK to qualify. Tierd of seeing CSK always in playoffs.,12
Smith should play 5 legspinners today.,48
Stevie can you please not come back to form today,7
Can we just play ABD at number 11. And says it's just a prank bro like the last game?,15
I am getting a funny feeling that RR is going to blow RCB away. Their superstars haven't performed in a long time and they may all be eager to prove some points.,19
"Please please drop Finch and Siraj. I know they try their best but they’re passengers in this team. 

DDP, Parthiv, Kohli, ABD, Moeen, Dube, Morris, Udana, Sundar, Chahal, Saini",1
[deleted],7
A lot of IDIOTS underrate de Villiers thinking he's some kind of aggressive batsman who only hits balls while finishing. He should come at no.3 ahead of kohli,2
Would love to see ABD smashing Jofra all around the stadium,3
"If RCB and DD win today, the rest of the GS will effectively become a battle for 4th spot.",10
Tf I thought match will start at 7 30,4
"Is it just me or the pre/post match show on Starsports is too professional, the hosts seems to try to make it funny every time but it rarely works, Cricbuzz Live is usually more chilled out, also love Dugout as well but the same people looks different on the pre/post match show",4
"Dear rr fans, we are gonna lose this.",12
Butler vs ABD = Present mr.360 vs past mr.360,7
Will RCB drop AB if RR play Markande along with Tewatia and Gopal?,5
"To be honest, I felt like RCB as a team just took the match against KXIP lightly. I’m not saying it’s wrong, but it just felt like that.",4
"RCB don't fuck this up.

I have high hopes and expectations this year.",9
[deleted],-2
Surely guys like AB and Dhoni can't be expected to keep forever. Are there no up and coming Indian keepers who can also maybe score the odd 30 off 20?,5
"#Predict your winners here


RCB vs RR

RR for me, Archer is going to tear through Finch and Koach.  


DC vs CSK

CSK would make DC look like MI.",1
"Would like to see this line-up:

1. Manan Vohra
2. Jos Buttler ✈️
3. Steve Smith ✈️ (C)
4. Sanju Samson (WK)
5. Ben Stokes ✈️
6. Riyan Parag
7. Rahul Tewatia
8. Jofra Archer ✈️
9. Shreyas Gopal
10. Kartik Tyagi
11. Mayank Markande",4
RR getting a win would be nice. Would mean more competition for 3rd and 4th spots.,5
RR fans have already accepted the loss before the toss even took place wtf,2
"If RR plays 3 leggies today

I m changing my flair to RR

Best team of the tournament",4
We lost toss boys,6
[deleted],5
"Hopefully rcb have the balls to not play finch, but really doubt they do.",2
Dube and siraj out,4
[deleted],4
Why is Harsha a simp when he talks to Virat,8
"I really wish Jaiswal was with MI

RR destroying his confidence",-4
"Rr trying to keep game competitive 

Not playing the extra leggie",7
They literally named a team after RandiRona.,5
Wtf Changes are these...siraj makes sense but Dube?,1
I’m convinced Finch has Kohli’s nudes. Watch RR score 190 here and RCB crumble for 110 all out,9
Vohra should have gotten a chance in place of Robbie and put Stokes in middle order. Thoughts?,9
[deleted],69
Anyone knows how Shahbaz plays?,2
"What does shabaz ahmed bring to the table btw

Never seen him b4",2
" >Rajasthan's team is unchanged and Smith indicates Ben Stokes will open again.

Team in dire need of a good middle order batsman and the crackhead captain keep playing one of the best middle order batsman currently available as an opener in a team with three other valid openers. SMH",27
"Shahbaz Ahmed is a good all-rounder, ill take these changes",5
Yeh bc robbie team mein kyu hai,2
Why drop Dube ffs?,3
"Rr fans dont watch this match, it will hurt y'all by seeing them lose",0
"> he comes in for Siraj

Thank god for that, what a relief.",6
Watch how RCB does some even more braindead shit today by sending AB in at 10 to shore up the tail.,5
"Man , I don't know about opening with buttler and stokes. It offers amazing attack, however both batsmen are very vulnerable to lose their wickets. Opening Uthappa would offer some long opening pairs, but looking at his form, It may not be worth it.",3
Why would u drop Dube? wtf,11
Rajasthan plays leg spinner and RCb respond by playing right handed batsman,3
[removed],13
"Fuck cricket, I am here for Koach's mujra",48
Why is Finch getting so many chances?,12
RCB : The king of awful changes.,20
Abd will be tired after keeping 20 overs,36
"Jofra will bowl really well, but they'll still lose.",7
"I swear to fucking god if these cunts lose 3 wickets in the powerplay again. Duh.

I know Smith's form is rotten but Buttler can't be getting away with his 21(11) either. If he's batting well, he needs to take it deep to give the side some stability. All his knocks barring the Mumbai innings have been cameos which have ended before the powerplay. Needs to be better.",25
Buttler vs Morris or Buttler vs Saini?,3
"Rooting for a Buttler special

Big time he needs to show why he is the most destructive **TOP ORDER** batsman currently",4
Hate Hindi commentators all you want but some of their anecdotes are damn funny.,4
Battle of the Batdeep.,5
"So its world no 1 batsman vs Virat kohli


*I have achieved Komady™*",5
Hearing rumours that Kohli wants Stokes in his team next year. It's why he says his name on the field every game,63
"Stokes is the best guy you would want in your middle order, it would be understandable him opening if they are chasing 240 but honestly the guys at CricViz are either smoking some serious shit or know something we dont",4
"As far as I have seen, Dube was connecting the ball pretty well this year. Why the change? Maybe because of Morris' last innings they thought he won't really be necessary?",6
[RIFT™ unconfirmed?](https://i.imgur.com/hf8bEry.jpg),18
"They dropped Dube? 

What has that dude done to deserve this?",4
Is this a Cricket match or a 4-D Chess match?,10
"Shahbaz Ahmed is a bowling allrounder, that is why he comes in for Dube. Brings more balance to the team since we replaced a bowler with a batsman. And tbh, Dube’s batting has not been consistent enough for him to be an automatic selection.",6
Best batting order would be jof and lord opening and virat and abd to bowl to them,23
Kohli will play against the physical manifestation of his favorite word,58
"Poor dube in the team as a pinch hitting explosive finisher, Morris came in and took his job",8
Is rr..... unchanged?,2
Stokes will find form against rcb today just so that he can hear Kohli say his name,16
Khaleel is an annoying piece of shit. Take wickets on shit deliveries and celebrate as if he bowled like Wasim Akram.,28
"Today the game of polarizing strategies

One team opens with finisher

One team finishes with top order batsman",10
Looks like RCB will screw this up again trying to do more experiments. All they had to do is to bring PP for Finch and Moeen for Siraj.,2
What’s a good score today?,1
I want jof to take koach's wicket and do the nagin dance to establish dominance,3
"Can someone explain rcbs changes today? 

I genuinely dont get it",3
"I swear,if RR loses this match,I will block my crush.",43
Sundar can bowl in powerplay now. Shahbaz and chahal can bowl the middle overs.,3
Moeen got retained but no confidence shown in his ability now sad,2
"What, no Dube? He's been pretty handy with the ball even though his batting hasn't clicked yet. 

If this is the sacrifice needed to get rid of Siraj, I'm all in",5
butter political support many uppity air party run offer spotted ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `,5
Why Royals always plays noon🔥 match ?!! every weekend !,8
"People say star sports has ruined the theme songs and the fun part of ipl, I agree to some extent

But their preview of each match is too good",9
"Is Kohli gonna say Ben Stokes’s name when he gets out? He better get out sometime, if he bats 20 overs we are fucked.",10
Smith mf step up your game,3
"Rcb missing the trick by dropping Siraj

Missed the battle of Lords",26
"If Bangalore can crack Rajasthan in the powerplay like last game, they will win for sure.",10
excited to see shahbaz,11
"r/cricket when dube is there in team: aye remove this asshole can't do shit

r/cricket after he was removed: wtf rcb?? I was shitposting",66
I think this the game where everyone in RR comes back to form.,48
If smith doesnt perform in this match then we can safely say that he is playing for money.,0
"Plz make Robbie open, he is crappy everywhere else",11
"I know we haven't seen Gurkeerat bat this season.
But is he good?",5
"All I demand is a new winner this season or a team which hasnt won in a long time, pls",4
"Let's see how this goes, batting needs to click for RR to pose some challenge to RCB",8
I hate Kohli's changes everytime.What was wrong with bringing in PP for Finch and Moeen for Siraj??Would have relieved the gloves from AB as well and given us an extra spin bowling option.??,5
Are match threads sorted by Best after the reddit update for everyone?,2
"Master tactician vs Grandmaster tactician. Stokes to open, Chahal to bowl at death, Dube to shield AB, Finch to remain inert against spinners, Uthappa to finish up games while Smith unleashes his inner tailender.",8
"Guys, every memory I have about an RR vs RCB afternoon game in the second half of the season is a Sanju Samson century. Will we get another one today?",2
Our biggest mystery for whom is the umpires playing for?,2
"Judging from the past, RCB gets Smith back in-form just in the right time. I hope the bowling line up proves me wrong.",3
Uthappa in,2
"ITS HAPPENING
ROBBIE OPEN!!!",5
"RR and RCB every game:




🎵 🎶 We can never be royals🎶🎵",7
Robin and Stokes?! Seriously no buttler? WTF Smithy,6
Finally RR opened with Uthappa,5
What the fuck? Stokes and Uthappa? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahshshshshshshahahahaha...... We've lost already,6
HAHAHAHA wtf Stokes and Uthappa opening?,10
"FINALLYYYY

FINALLYYY 

only for Robbie to get 13(9)",7
Random Team Generator Vs Random Opening Generator!!!,12
"Opening with Robbie is good, but you demoted the wrong guy fellas 😭😭",5
"Look at this shit from RR. Finally they got Robbie to open, the pretty much only position he can play but dropped down Jos fookin Butler",10
random opener generator intensifies,7
"Rr vs rcb, afternoon game, rr batting first ...

Where have I seen this before",3
at least they are not putting all their top batsmen at the top and struggle in the second half,2
Who dis Shahbaz guy? Shall I have him as my dream 11 captain?,1
Random Opening Pair Generator strikes again!,3
Buttler demoted wtf lmaooo,6
"Robin is opening



with STOKES?",7
RR using random opening pair generator.,12
"Right boys, let's have a good game here.",1
Why does the batsman wear thigh guard inside the pants while the pads are worn outside?,1
Finally Robbie gets to open. Good luck to him.,5
Wtf is this opening pair. It should be Robbie and Buttler ffs,4
Why did they chose to bat first? Especially against rcb,2
Rajasthan's management has gone full retard.,9
U cant be royals without pushing ur wk batsman down the order,6
Hahaha the ROG meme is real,1
"I am a big fan of Robbie, but he is clearly past his prime. Wish RR backed Yashaswi instead.",3
"Yet to see anyone really put pressure on Sundar at the start, hopefully today is the day",1
I think it's safe to declare Smith as insane. Uthappa and Stokes to open :facepalm,2
Fuck me... they had to find rightful place for robin against RCB. What s RCB s past karma to deserve this?,4
Weirdest opening pair in this IPL,4
"Wait, both teams are making good decisions now? Uthappa opening, Washi bowling.",3
Smith is on some high quality stuff who tf doesnt allow buttler to open,4
"Some of these IPL teams are trying to be too clever; RCB putting AB at 6, RR opening with Stokes...",5
Uthappa and Buttler opening- I prefer the real openers                 Stokes and Buttler opening- *I said the real openers*                     Uthappa and Stokes opening- *PeRfEcTiOn*,9
Now watch abd get get promoted ... So much so that he opens and replaces paddikal,9
I thought Kohli was the only 2000 IQ captain this year. Smudge just outdid him.,46
"wtf peak RTG, why would you drop Buttler down the order",6
"So butler must be the finisher,right?",6
Ah yes play the opener in middle order and the middle order batsman as opener,11
Uthappa and Stokes 😂😂😂😂,4
Time to meme uthappa back into form,3
Jos can play in the middle order. Calm down ffs.,10
Don't know why Stokes is being used as opening batsman..,4
Is it the first day match at Dubai?,6
RR batting first? We are fucked.,6
You know you love the game when you wake up at 3am to watch a team you don’t even support,6
Did Smith go to the DK school of randomising batting order,7
I love RCB matches. They can crush MI and get crushed by teams like KXIP RR in the same week.,18
"Send Stokes in at number 5. Buttler-Uthappa would've been a better pair. Nothing against Stokes, he just makes their already strong middle order stronger if he comes in at 5.",11
"Drop Buttler if u have openers like Roy and bairstow

Not fucking totally out of prime Robbie uthappa",4
"why they advertising this Dubai expo shit in India and it's not even taking place this year, almost a year later",2
I can sense a Shreyas Gopal fifer incoming,8
"anyone else having trouble with the hotter broadcast?

*hotstar
** nvm they just dont like VPNs",1
im gonna bet right now that uthappa and buttler are gonna open next game,10
"Guys wtf is this by smudge.
Send in Uthaapa and Buttler as your openers. Stokesy is a proper at 5",6
Does RR use a random number generator to decide the batting order?,3
What is smith smoking.,2
This is some insane shit. Whether it works or not. Insane shit.,7
"All the srh fans be supporting rcb and dehli today. 

It’s all about vengeance against rr and csk. Plus they will help srh in the points table",2
Now who has this Big brain in RR,2
"I think RR wants stokes to open for the right left combo, I mean I kinda get it, but still think that Stokes should be kept for middle.",3
good over washi!,2
i think the fun part of rr's games is trying to guess who they're gonna open with,3
"Took me an hour to find the Match thread. Please upvote, people.",2
Left right combo is good because they are playing on the secondary pitch so that makes the boundaries uneven.,1
did Stokes say he doesn't want to bat in the middle order,6
Would really wanna see RCB win here,3
"This is what happens when you bowl your best powerplay bowler in the powerplay. 

Keep things simple, Koach. 🙏",9
Smith has such weird brain farts,6
Team managements are trying all kinds of shit in IPL2020. why can’t they keep it simple ffs.,7
"First 5D chess move from Smith, watch Koach trump it by having Chahal open the batting while he demoted himself to 7 so he can wait until Gopal’s spell is over",9
Soo..is this Josh thing the new tik tok?,6

Decision Making with 100000000 iq,7
"80 IQ : Stokes & Buttler

120 IQ : Buttler & Uthappa

200000 IQ : Stokes & Uthappa",44
"It’s an interesting one to knock Buttler down the order over Stokes however, I get it, Buttler provides an interesting catch 22 in being an excellent opener but also a world class finisher.

Obviously Stokes is a quality finisher as well but if he can fire at the top then there’s absolutely no harm in Buttler coming later on.",4
"Finch really has to fire, else no point playing him again and again anymore",3
Best scenario for RCB today is RCB and DC win.,4
Stokes is no opener.,4
"**Openers for RR this season**

Jaiswal - Smith 

Buttler - Smith

Buttler - Jaiswal

Stokes - Buttler

Stokes - Uthappa

*5 combinations in 9 matches*",20
Buttler come at 3 or as a finisher?,1
Haven't really thought much about RR at the beginning of the tournament but they have forced me to care about them.  I think they have been the biggest contributors to the excitement in this year's IPL.,4
Holy heck I forgot how deep tipo begins his run-up,1
So much for Jos the Boss. Got demoted by what? Accident?,4
It seemed VK had a heart to heart talk with SPD last night.,3
RR trying to level the playing field for when Kohli pulls out another one of his big brain moves,5
"When the team you support isn’t playing, do y’all support the team that is your 2th...3rd...4th favorite or do y’all support the team whose victory will indirectly benefit the main team you support (atleast in the second half of the tourney)",2
"If rr really wants left-right hand combo and is ready to push any middle order batsman to open, then send the lord!!",3
How is the pitch guys? Who does it favour? Batting first or second,2
"Just noticed that they have pushed down Butler!!

The stuff RR management is smoking must be pretty strong!",5
Chris Morris is the grown up version of Sid from Toy Story,3
"Wait, DDP field mein aur DDG comm box mein, interesting",2
wait did brian lara take the wicket alert? he’s the only one I fear,5
ffs thought yall were kidding when i read stokes and utthappa opening 😂,10
Who is this Shahbaaz Ahmed? What does he do?,7
RCB's plan should be to let Robbie play as many balls as he can..,11
They're opening with Uthappa and Stokes just to see who can walk forward the farthest before twatting the ball to the boundary.,20
Why is RR never good enough for meme team contendership?,11
Buttler would had hit 4 boundaries by now,11
Utthapa should play whole powerplay to settle,10
Morris's bowling action makes me feel like he's gonna get injured every ball,5
"God damn, South Africa has to bring back Morris in the team. He's in a superb flow! Imagine Nortje Rabada and Morris!!",13
So will sanju play at no 5?,2
"I'm nothing more than a arm chair expert, but that left-right combination crap is overrated.",9
Yarrapa ee Shabaz Ahmed?,2
"Hope Shahbaz Ahmed plays like the Ben Stokes of Bengal like he wished, and not the bhenchod of Bengal",2
"I realised that Smith is the only one left from RR’s 2014-15 squad that Morris played with. That was RR’s strongest lineup - Faulkner, Watson, Hodge, Smith, Morris, Rajat Bhatia, Tambe, Binny, Rahane.",3
"Smith playing 69D chess

Left and right opening combo

Uthappa out Normal Buttler comes out

Stokes out Left handed Buttler comes out",9
I'm waiting with bated breath for the entry of Lord Devereaux,1
"At least , Root makes better decisions as IPL captain than Smudge and Kohli",8
Halfway into the season and RR still don’t know their best XI or have a settled top order. That’s the difference between teams at the bottom and teams at the top. Guys in MI know what their roles are,8
Thalia Uthappa.. chinna Thala stokes.,6
Everyone in RCB looks like they got a fresh haircut,7
Inb4 the lord plays the innings of his life,7
Should RCB even try to take uthappa's wicket? I reckon they should let him stay...DC did it well. He'll eat up PP balls and run out some partners,7
Scenes in this thread if Uthappa scores a century,5
love that swing.,5
Calm down guys Butler literally bats down the order in ODIs for Eng,6
RCB bat till no 9,6
Dube got booted huh. He hit two good sixes last match. Should have looked to be explosive from the start.,6
I just don't get why batsmen are struggling to score against Sundar.,4
Oh no! Big brain RR is trying Mr. Nags' inflate-deflate strategy.,7
"Da faq, now  Buttler has been pushed down.

Kohli gets so much shit if he does something like this

Why is this Sandpaper guy allowed to go unaccountable?",7
"Ok bois,RR has lost the game",4
Mid season captaincy change was actually needed for RR and KXIP. I went from admiring Smith to absolutely detesting him this season. That fuckers decisions alone fucked up RR team big time this season. I hope they drop him from the XI after 1 or 2 more matches,4
Giga IQ leave. Comes down the track aggressively just to play a watchful leave,11
A Buttler 20(10) would be better than this,7
"Dread it, run from it, 9(20) Uthappa still arrives",12
Wheres my boi Jos at,9
fucking finally,6
"lmao RR this is power play, I hope u know that.",2
"That Cricviz analyst is seriously messing with RR's thought process, unnecessary changes to the lineup earlier then if that is not happening the batting order.",2
So when does this match starts?,5
Batting sides don't really go full throttle in the powerplay anymore.,3
Buttler is known for 50 ball hundreds down the order for england.,3
RR trading Tripathi for Uthappa is making sense now. Their decision making is staggering,6
“Robin Ootappa”,3
Sundar has an outstanding economy rate of just 4.50 runs per over inside the powerplay this season,6
"Bruh what is this, Uthappa scoring boundaries?",7
Uthappa is looking good,7
"Oh yeah robbie this is your game,do your thing",6
oh shit rcb feeling cheated on,6
"Okay, okay some intent from Uthappa",2
This Mr Nags moron is by far the most annoying and cringeworthy character any franchise has come up with,-1
Uthappa of KKR,3
Sending Uthappa to open might be a very good move.,3
Lord Uthappa!,2
Gayle has just mentally destroyed Sundar hasn't he,12
So uthappa was always a good opener?,45
"By the fact that it's RCB, expect either Smudge or Uthaapa to be back in form",6
Two more boundaries and Koach will drop Sundar in the next game,10
"Stokes playing slowly

He either wants robbie to hit or get out when trying to hit",7
Robbie wtf. This is not how u play,7
Uthappa up in the order to face Washington?,7
Robbie 👏👏,7

Sundar’s gonna do something isn’t he,5
Oh lord. We ded.,8
"Uthappa redemption, here we go <3",11
Uthappa yess,2
"Damn r/Cricket, you had to meme Uthappa into form today of all days",92
"alright now, remove the mask",10
Wth washi,5
Yeah take that Sundar!,2
Just tuned in. Lmao who is this super saiyan uthappa?,2
Uthaapa redemption arc incoming,8
Now just dont give your wicket away Mr.Utopia,3
Forgot how pleasing Robbie is to watch when he's in form,10
Of course Uthappa decides to play today -_-,7
robbie to u/aryanx1234 : talk nah,3
Fuck,3
Bruh Lmao,6
Washi Is getting dropped next match confirmed,2
LORD UTHAPPA,2
yes all it takes is playing against RCB to get form back,3
"Can we make a separate thread, where people can comment about that this is 2020",2
Smith is winning the 8D chess match now,4
Uthappa God,2
What do you say now r/cricket,5
W-Washington? U-Uthappa?,1
Utthappa opening is fine but why not butler instead of stokes..teams not realizing that you should pick your players according to the position rather left right combo,3
Sundar ko sundar se peet diya,4
BC Uthappa.,4
Where's Buttler?,2
"Wait...Uthappa's good when he opens? 

Always has been.",6
We gonna bring Uthappa into form lol,8
Goddamnit uthappa,1
"Uthappa just smashed Sundar, talk about unexpected",6
All I want from this year's IPL is Gayle to make Kuldeep cry again,2
I was promised 11(20) not 20(11) FFS. Why do you play with my emotions RR.,7
Are we in 2008?,4

How to shut  this sub up in an single over.,13
Uthappa trying to make the opening spot his own. Him and Buttler would be a great combination. I'd rather have Stokes a little lower considering the number of top order players in the team.,8
Oh an opener playing well in the opening position,9
"Gayle has destroyed Sundar , hasn't he?",3
Sundar' mystery is now fading away. Gayle paved the path couple of days ago,1
So sweeping Sundar is the key to success. Opening batsmen frantically taking notes.,5
This is like 6 sixes equivalent for Sundar,7
KKR Uthappa is back,4
"16 off the over, Rajasthan creating lords out of every player!",8
We're fucked aren't we,3
*Who is this Sundar guy and why is he bowling in the powerplay? Very bad captaincy from Kohli*,8

Udana was just unlucky there to be honest,6
I hate the rr management more now,4
"Didn't RR plan how the team should layout before the auction. Looks like they just wanted some big names and completely forgot about strategy. Stokes, Buttler, Samson, Smith all are good middle order batters. But what's the point of you don't have a good opening pair.",4
Looks like Luck is in our favour,3
"Everyone here wanted Sundar to bowl in the powerplay last game, but what exactly do you think would've happened on Sharjah, in the powerplay, bowling to KL and Mayank?",6
David Miller is definitely on a vacation,1
"If Uthappa was brought in specifically to neuter Sundar, that's actually a clever decision by RR. Should have used him against Ashwin/Axar too",1
Oh no Koach.exe will stop working soon,33

This is the first time RR's opening pair have lasted three overs in their fifth opening combination in nine matches.,14
"Uthappa opening is actually really good for RR. 

They couldn't use him in middle order. If he scores some odd 30-40 runs at 150+ SR, RR should count it as a win.",11
RCB back to their roots.,5
Too afraid to ask but what is with Indian fast bowlers and the exaggerated jump? Don't see it often with fast bowlers from other countries,1
"Shit , Uthappa is back , could be good for RR",2
"I add Uthappa to my fantasy team, and he suddenly performs good. Co-incidence? I think not.",10
"Uthappa good,Sundar bad",2
Ex RCBians always bring their A game against RCB,5
"What r/cricket expects : Uthappa 33(90)* + running out two of his partners. 

What ends up happening : Uthappa 98(33) and motm.",15
"I am in dilemma 

Didn't choose Uthappa in my 11, but want him to keep doing well now !!",5
Did he change the field caz he scored a boundary or was he waiting for it go boundary,7
"Since next year is the Mega Auction , do you think RR will retain Smith , Butler and Stokes ?",6
RR playing with England mentality,13
"Dread it, Run from it. The familiar RCB is incoming",14
"Now that I think about it, Rahul and Agarwal would have murdered Sundar.",5
We're in trouble today,7
I can see RCB losing some 3 wickets by this point when they bat already,5
Yup Sundar's gonna get cunted today,7
This makes sense.  I'm convinced Sundar has been given way more respect in the powerplay than he deserves.  He overs need to be dismantled and it isn't that difficult.,10
How good are we? Bringing uthappa into form,19
Lmao ump,5
[deleted],4
Match between 2 of the dumbest management sides with frequently brain fading captains who are the best criketers in present.,7
"Rajasthan: Robin, you're an opener?

Uthappa: Always have been",34
Wish Umesh Yadav was bit good we atleast would have new ball seamer,6
RR should Trade Smith for Bairstow and Rename the Team as England*TM*,12
Man Udana has been overlooked this season. He's been lowkey one of RCB's key player,12
RCB: [Chuckles] I'm in danger.,6
rr going full kxip mode lols,7
what udana doing,2
Stokes turned towards the ump like he said something homophobic,10
We are scared of Uthappa fuckin Uthappa,9
I'm still salty at RCB management for letting De Kock go. He would've been a perfect fit for us.,8
This makes sense.  I'm convinced Sundar has been given way more respect in the powerplay than he deserves.  His overs need to be dismantled .,9
"Is it mandatory to mention "" CRED"" each time you mention the powerplay? Like stop it bruh. It's cringe",4
I love to see robbie coming down like that,9
Uthappa back in form lmao,5
Uthappa POGGGGG,4
"So, Uthappas schooling Stokes eh? r/cricket has peaked",17
Back to back wides means you are shitting your pants atm,11
I'm sorry Robbie 😭,8
Uttappa 2016 has entered the chat.,36
Uthappa rolling back the years,12
WTF I went to take a piss and Uthappa is now playing in 163 S/R,12
"So they turn on the lights in the second innings, gonna get a few drop catches",6
I had a tasty uttapam for breakfast. Coincidence? I think not.,11
That's the Robbie right there. The walking assassin.,12
HOLY FUCK ROBBIE,4
Robbie not today bro. Come on broooo! 😔,10
hahahah no shitt 👏,2
"Oh my god ok Robbie I get it, I am sorry",7
They had to change Uthappa's position against us only,8
Hahahahahaha,3
When you want Stokes on strike instead of Uthappa.,3
**IDU IDU** Uthappa andre,3
"Uthappa opening makes sense

But why no Jos the boss",2
Robin ~~Chutappa~~ Utopia,5
Why do teams choose RCB to get their players back in form?,11
Where was this Robbie when he played out a maiden for us last year?,2
"Udana had no pace at all, can't give him the new ball",2
listen I’m as confused as you are,9
"Give ball to Saini!!

He will sort out Uthappa.",2

What a time to be alive to witness this,3
Seems Buttler is wearing Uthappa shirt today /s,0
"Slightly unrelated, but Rr winning today would increase CSK's playoff chances right?",3
ROBIEEE GIVING A BIG FUCK YOU TO THE MANAGEMENT FOR PLAYING HIM AT 5,7
I blame this sub for bringing uthapa back to form,9
R C B Bowling has entered the chat,2
What's this Robin Robbie thing? Did he change his name?,2
This is not even the Uthappa of 2016. This is the Uthappa of 2009. WTF is this. Holy fuck.,3
Giroud getting cunted,5
Robbie reveals his mask and shows us he is jos all along,4
"Okay, you can remove your mask Buttler :) We know it's you in disguise",5
Uthappa the ex rcbian,7
Not today,3
Wtf Uthappa is so good,6
"Uthappa is best as an opening batsman , no two ways about it.",6
Robbie watched some highlights from 2014,6
I'm tired Robbie: Koach,5
I will start a photoshop course if Uthhapa scores 100 today,5
RCB lost twice to Puuuuuuunjab,3
Lmao Sundar bowls one bad over and r/cricket immediately turns on him,41
Smith and Samson are not finishers why play them at 4 and 5. Simply do Uthappa Buttler Samson Smith Stokes,7
"Make an apology thread for Uthappa right now, maybe he will stop.",20
You people don't dare shit on Uthappa. Not even Sehwag was aggressive enough to come halfway down the pitch for Murali and hit him for a six!!,11
"Steve smith: Miracle, Miracle! my batting order is working finally",8
Wtf happened to Uthappam,6
"Why oh why, am I a rcb fan",12
\*chuckles\* we're in danger,7
The amount of disrespect shown towards Uthappa by RR management so far is appalling.,9
Excited for the 'steve smith captain apology thread',13
I need to see Koach and Smudge bowl to each other.,6
"Uthappa's coming down the pitch shot is very iconic for me, I still remember him winning a match for India in England in 2007.",15
Here comes the beamer cheat,4
"Robbie, you could have waited 1 more game before getting back into form, dude.",8
I hope it will be a high scoring match today,8
RCB is chasing 200 here pretty much sure,5
Sorry Uthappa...,9
Lol Koach destroyed everyone’s confidence last game,10
Need chahal to come in and do one bye bye to Uthappa asap,5
And suddenly rcb looks like a weak team.,5
"Saini with a Mohawk, why",5
Ofcourse it had to be this match,24
Always the fucking former rcb players,8
So Udana is the new Siraj today?,7
"100% RCB gonna bottle the chase. Cheap wickets from Kohli and ABD, you heard it here.",14
"RR : the biggest crime I can commit is not murder but , to waste powerplay",7
"Next up, Dhoni will open with Sam Curran after looking at Robbie's innings",3
How is it that everyone comes back to form against us,6
"Uthappa ensuring place in next IPL, gotta get those 5000 runs",5
Dale Steyn should play,3
Teams batting 2nd have only won 2/14 matches at Dubai this season,2

r/cricket memeing cricketers back into form since 2020.",9
Lord Uthappa wearing KKR jersey??,3
[deleted],-1
Is this the team that was 33-3 in 5 overs last time they played?,7
RCB should be thanked for getting players in form,7
We're fucked.,5
"We've had a plethora of opening partnerships this season

Also, 38/0 after 4 overs? Do my eyes deceive me?",6
"RR have been too focused on the glamor white boys, when it is the Indian lads without much fanfare who have been doing all the heavy lifting with the bat.",14
F,2
"Best opening partnership so far this tournament for RR is...
Stokes and Uthappa?",43
RR uniform looks so good in day matches,3
haha were fucked,12
i think uthappa was underperforming for the last couple of years cause they put 'robbie' on the scorecard and not 'uthapa',16
Umm.. So who's gonna put up a Robbie Uthappa apology thread after the game?,14
"Guys think about it this way, if Uthappa scores a 50 here, Finch will get a 100 without breaking a sweat. Anyone can be memed back into form!",13
"RCB always chokes while chasing. RR fans, you got this.",20
RCB's quota of 5 wins this year is already done. So it's about time we start loosing,20
Why is Shivam Dube dropped?,6
It was Gayle previous match now we have Robbie and Stokes.,21
RCB supporters: LoveDay lag gaye!,8
I thought Stokes was supposed to be the dasher.,2
RCB seem like they doing a repeat of their 2013 season,11
Guess what happens when you play a quality player in his position? They've only done it half though.,6
Play Uthappa in his natural position and he has come good? Who would've thunk?,14
Saini still dishes out one shit ball per over. He should try to get that down or he will end up like Umesh,5
"No Harsha it was Right- Left combination, teams cant live without it",12
Last match Kxip handed over their responsibility of bringing players back in form to RCB,12
Guys can you meme finch and kohlis captaincy into form too?,18
Every Karnataka batsman hits peak form when facing RCB.,55
Uthappa against other teams 14 (29). Uthappa against RCB 29 (14).,26
"When it's RCB, the batsmen suddenly get into a positive state of mind.",34
Big brain move from Aussie Smith ensuring the British Smith will shuffle the batting order of England to fix something that isn't broken.,11
Rcb fans are really optimistic,4
Can we start an award in name of Dhoni for anchors in the match as their role is underrated?,4
Me watching Udana go for 17: justice for Siraj,5
"Uthappa memed back into form, another example of the magic of r/cricket",6

RR taking the revenge of the first afternoon match,2
Normally RR would have already lost 2-3 wickets bt now. RCB is in big trouble,4
Yay! Yet another drop by a RCB fielder!,5
Also who is Shahbaz Ahmad?,5
"At this rate, they might open with tewatia-archer in a couple of matches.",8
The only Ex-RCBian to show his gratitude to his former team till now is Kedar Jadhav.... Being human intensifies,21
"Bruhh, even Luck is in the favour of Lord Uthappa",3
Smith is preparing for IITs and currently trying to learn Permutations and Combinations by practicing it on batting line-up,20
Good day for Koach cam.,11
Those moves in the last match practically showed all the cards to other teams.,2
Kohli dropping another Karnataka opener,6
*That was a sitter. Very bad fielding from Kohli*,10
200 anyone?,2
Koach trying a Kapil dev,6
"Wasn't an easy chance by any means, but feel like it's been a while since kohli last took a good catch. He used to barely drop any",3
Are smartwatches allowed on field? Looks like kohli is wearing one.,5
"So RCB is done. My other favorite team, Liverpool, hope they win today.",11
Is that the match?,4
Dropped or out of reach?,5
Uthappa now targetting Kohli,4
This is the right way to play PP. The good old Sanath Kalu way... Tonk everything in the air.,4
Hindi commentator still calling him Super V. Like dude you dont need to kiss his ass for a catch attempt come on.,8
Does that drop mean We're gonna see a Robbie 100?,6
Now r/cricket need to meme Kohli back into his 2016 form.,17
No way we're gonna chase anything above 160.,4
Not an RR fan but I just want Stokes and Butler to do well in at least one innings. Their reputations are so huge it’s a shame if there’s at least not one innings to back it up.,2
Yo Uthappa chill mate don't get out yet.,1
That's not even half a chance.,2
All Karnataka batsmen hit form when facing RCB. I of course am talking of Ben Stokes Hegde,10
[deleted],0
Leave it to RCB to get spanked by Uthappa.,2
RCB's bowling is back on the menu boys. Lol.,4
RCB ain't chasing this. RR win it is,6
Watch how the pitch behave when Finch starts to bat,6
If this was Buttler instead of Stokes RCB was *F U C K E D*,2
Love the approach from Robbie,5
4D Chess by RCB. Give so many extras that they can chase the biggest total in IPL this season. Understandable.,8
Stokes plz get out to Morris,-1

Finch 100 (52) loading?,2
Kohli drops astonishing amount of catches but is marketed like he's one of the best in the field.,-3
Some fresh uthappams on this scorching afternoon ...,1
Yo why does Virat rotate his bowlers so often?,-1
Can't believe I'm saying this but.....bat like Robbie BC,1
"RR: *finally plays Uthappa in his actual position*

Uthappa: *plays well*

RR: *surprised Pikachu face*",8
RR middle order suddenly looks deadly with Buttler Samson and Lord Tewatia,-1
Kohli and ABD to open for RCB and take home a 10 wicket win,3
"RCB drops Siraj

Now the rest of the team decided to become Siraj Lite",9
"Oh thank god, no siraj today",1
"If Finch doesn't fire like this as an opener, time to bring in Philippe or Ali. Idc",3
My advice to RR batsmen except Tewatia : Boys only fours no sixes....,3
Ab de Villiers would have caught this catch easily,1
"Nobody cares about that run out, we know it's not out ffs",4
Why does RCB feels like shit team after defeat to KXIP. I want them to win this time but don't know why i am feeling negative.,7
I wish our openers would play like this.,4
My family wanted to go out for a drive. I cancelled it so that I can watch the RCB shitshow. Am I a certified sadist?,4
Sundar's economy falling at a rate worse than Indian economy.,2
"Kohli should've glared harder at the big screen

Umpire would've given it out",1
Seriously how incompetent these umpires are,4
"See, Gill, this is how you play in a fucking powerplay",6
Why do umpires have to always phone a friend on every run out?,3
Fuck these umpires. Can't even give such an easy decision,5
"Oh come on, wtf are umpires useful for. That's a clear not out",4
Watch RCB do a KXIP and lose all their remainder games this season lmao,7
2014 vibes from Robappa,6
Finch 12(17) incoming,5
Swanny shitting on umpire is always funny.,2

"Genuinely feel bad for Miller. Dude played one match and got out without facing a ball, and hasn't played since. I know this is a tough team to get into for overseas players, still it sucks for him

Btw if he was in the team he would have probably opened by now lol",11
"According to my expert opinion, RR should not lose wickets and score at a good run rate to win. If RCB needs to win, they should take wickets and and control run rate. It's as simple as that",5
Finally.. Fuck finally,5
Thanks Morris,3
[removed],7
Yaaassss,3
"I think these Umpires can't see white lines.
How do you send that to third umpire?",5
Uthappa was always a good opener.. he was honestly wasted in middle order.. glad to see him play freely at the top,8
You Morris Anna.,6
Oooh,3
Chad Morris > Virgin Stokes,11
"The third umpire is like China, getting invited to interfere for everything.",13
Thank you,4
Yayyyy! Morris you beauty!,9
Morris you sexy man!,8
Welp Good Game Stokes,9
Morris has been a revelation,5
""" Morris is a bad buy""",8
Uthappa Stokes Face/Off confirmed?,-4
Can the stop this stokes experiment?,2
Chris Morris deserves those 10 crores,13
This sub should dissolve if Uthappa hits a 100,5
Imagine having 3 specialist openers in your team and sending STOKES to open.,6
Collapse incoming,-1
Uthappa and Buttler would have made more sense,2
hopefully they won’t send stokes to open after this,2
Stokes is so shit in IPL,-2
Shit Gets Wickets,2
Morris - 1 Stokes - 0,7
I knew it. 19 balls 15. Galaxy brain by McDonald,2
I'm just here for the battle of the giants: Jaydev Unadkat vs Isuru Unadkat.,5
Morris!!!!!,2
"Finally, a breakthrough!",3
[deleted],-1
"FFS Call them RR not ""double arse""",4
Opening with Stokes is understandable cos he plays with a very low strike rate in the middle overs.,1
Shit gets Wickets™ strikes again.,2
Morris lets go,2
"**5.4** Morris to Stokes, OUT, **taken down leg side.** Looks like a slower bouncer down leg side. Looks for the pull and is through it too soon. **50-1**

Stokes was looking hella uncomfortable,1
Jesus Christ stokes,1
"Just tuned in. Uthappa is opening?? And playing well?? Stokes is struggling???
What is happening???",0
Block a dangerous Yorker. Get fucked by a shit delivery. What have you done Stoksey!,5
Can we end the Stokes opener experiment now?,1
Stokes needs to get a move on.,1
Now see RR losing 2 wickets before 10th over,1
"Hope this is the end of the 'Opener' Stokes. He's a great middle order bat, why fuck that up?",3
Send tewatia you cowards.,2
"Maybe Rajasthan should move Stokes down the order where he normally bats and move Buttler back up to open

Needless complication of the batting lineup and its not working lmao",4
Sry wrong wicket rcb,3
Now to see who is coming next.,1
Block a dangerous Yorker. Get fucked by a shit delivery. What have you done Stoksey!,2
"No time to celebrate, RR looking like they going to score 200 at this rate, especially now with Samson batting...",2
Time to choke RR now,2
kohli: ben stokes,3
Morris with the golden arm for RCB this season.,4
Just open Uthappa with Buttler from now on. Stokes has no business taking Buttler's spot as an opener.,3
Bye Stokes.,1
Morris>>Stokes in T20s,1
Koach should shout Bhenchod everytime Ben Stokes gets out.,4
"Ben looks hurt, I hope it ain't much .",1
And here I was thinking how did RR go through entire pp without losing wickets,8
See? Stokes could've performed better than this if he came in at 5. Buttler would've been a better option to open. AB is still saving RCB.,5
these wannabe wholesome facebook ads are so irritating,6
Hopefully we learn from Uthappa's case today and play Stokes in the middle order,4
Smith should not bat today if RR wants to win,5
Was stokes ever good for RR ?,1
Chris Morris had been an absolute God send for us. Hope the owners retain him next season too..,8
"Was sad about Stoinis leaving but Morris is a better fit, we need the bowling more than the batting",7
[deleted],6
"Wait why is Stokes opening ahead of Buttler??

RR up to some naughty business again...",6
Was Stokes limping leaving field?,3
Buttler is now a finisher again,8
"Yes another good desicion by RR, Samson at 3",0

Samson?,3
Whooah samson at 3,3

Ben Stonks ↗️,7
RTG continues. Samson at 3,5
Why wouldn't you open with buttler tho he has established himself,3
Stokes needs a better captain,7
Smith trying the same thing over and over with Stokes and expecting different results.,5
"I have a feeling Warne is the one pushing for Stokes to open. He's just too big in the set up to be told,  ""NO.""",0
"Hopefully this will be the end of the Stokes opening experiement, he should be batting at 5, or maybe 4 if he needs to take his time. Our openers should be Uthappa/Jaiswal and Buttler",6
"So, now RR is using Butler as their finisher instead of opening. Hmm.",3
"Wooden spoon to RCB:

Uthappa gonna get holed out at cow corner right after the powerplay. Don't worry guys,2
nice to hear another english accent in the dugout,3
Imagine more than half your tournament being over and you’re still not playing the correct opening pair,6
Inb4 Samson gets out on single digit,8
"I want to believe, some of the fielders fight to be in the shadows today.",7
ABD is the MVP for RCB.,6
"how's this order

uthappa, samson, smith, stokes, buttler, parag, lord",8
When is buttler going to come? After Smith?,7
Imagine KXIP winning and RCB losing all of their remaining games.. threads on r/cricket would be lit.,11
Ok that's it from Morris till the death then,9
Dosa has finally evolved to Utthapa,13
I feel like you can only get the best out of Uthappa and Samson at this stage if both of them open. All 6 pp overs for these 2. Later on they'll fail to clear the boundary,5
RR 50 plus in the powerplay? Match is pretty much done. Aight Imma head out.,6
"Most destructive opener in the ipl as the floater, ok",7
Stokes opening experiment has flopped badly.,8
"I've never seen RCB's big money buys justify their price tags, so seeing Morris play good confuses me. .",9
This RR has no depth. Thet are rely sooo much on their overseas contingent.,2
Who is that csk bowler in lenskart ad?,2
"why did it take RR management so long to put Uthappam in his natural place, as the opener?",3
"Smith : I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.",7
Udana will be good option for Samson,3
"I feel like Morris gets a lot more respect than he deserves. Actually, you could say that about RCB's entire bowling lineup except Chahal.",3
"Our good luck charm Mann is back, so I'm optimistic.",6
"WTF, thought he was walking with a slight limp",3
Robin de Uthappa,2
Uthappa is on fire. No stopping now,2

Uthappa bloody hell what happened to u,3
Uthappa showing other Indian openers how it's done.,3
Take a shot every time someone says RR rely on their overseas players too much,3
*YOU CANNOT SET A FIELD FOR A SHOT LIKE THAT*,3
Uthappa treats fast bowlers like spinners by step down.,1
An expensive international buy playing well and working for RCB. What timeline are we in?,5
Uthappa removes the mask. It was Buttler all along.,3
Why did CSK release Chris Morris,6
"2 teams that are doing well in this year's IPL have not experimented at all and stuck to the basics. 

Fucking play openers as openers. 

How difficult it can be",12
"RCB going easy against teams with Karnataka players,lol",11

That step down slap is straight out of 2007 Uthappa,4
Vintage Uthappa shot,2
"*ONE MORE SHOT LIKE THAT, AND THE BOWLER WOULD BE OUT OF THE ATTACK*",2
Beamer incoming,2
I hear so much from commentators about how special Samson is.  I don't see it.  I mean he's good but I wouldn't rate him higher than Pant or Kishan in terms of batting talent.,4
Uthappa 100 coming up,3
Who will RR get to open next game I wonder?,2
"By opening with uthappa, RR has upgraded it to Onion Uthappa",8
Who is this guy... Unbelievable transformation,3
"Morris is definitely making a big difference, thank god delhi didn't retain him",2
"Vintage Robbie  show on here , just love it",5
Flamingos looking good today,3
"Step Out.


Smash.


Nostalgic by Uthappa.",8
I hope smith feels like he's a retard. Everyone knows Uthappa had to open.,9
Chad Uthappa,5
Why is Robin Uthappa asking for a beamer?,4
"I wonder whether this game will see Buttler coming down the order at 5 or 6. I know that he's had tremendous success opening for us but we need some stability down there, and his ability to counterattack and rebuild is something that no other batsman in the team can do consistently.

Uthappa (maybe Jaiswal in the future)

Samson

Smith (c)

Stokes

Buttler (wk)

Parag

Tewatia

Archer

Gopal

Rajput/Unadkat/Markande

Tyagi

That looks like a good team to me, but should probably be put into place next season, we've already fucked our batting order enough this year",3
I wish that was a 6. That would have been perfect.,5
Fuck if buttler opened with uthappa rcb would be cancelled by now,3
Holy fuck. What am I watching.,3
Ofc Robbie starts playing well against rcb lol,9
Uthappa turned to god only by switching a position?,3
Almost a beamer,4

Shakib doesn't have a team! Interested to see which team will splash money for him in the auction,3
Uthappa chill pls,6
"Awkward as a CSK fan, seeing people criticize 52 after the powerplay.

 Saini spending too much time with Umesh and Siraj,7
Padikkal is so elegant even while fielding,5
Will Stokes be able to bowl? That limp doesn't look very good.,6
RR opening with Robin is paying off really well.,3
"Just tuned in

Lmao why Stokes opened instead of Butler?",5
"Man!!! How good Uthappa hits ball ffs...

*Never watched IPL when he was in his ""prime""...*",7
"Navdeep ""beamer"" Saini",9
Morris is the same age as pollard,9
Uthappa is just so elegant to watch bat as an opener,4
Beamers already in lol.,6
Samson better show up today,7
Who added aged wine to the uthappa batter today?,8
"huh beamer gone wrong lol, seems intentional by Saini when he gets hit",4
Is udana really that much better than umesh at this point,4
Looks like RCB  is chasing a mammoth total again,2
"Didn't every man and his dog know that Uthappa is only effective as an opener? 

Why was he playing 4 for this long",5
"qualification is gonna be very hard once we lose this

we gotta beat kkr, srh and one of mi, dc or csk",2
Not even angry seeing Uthappa play well,8
Saini starts throwing beamers if he gets hit for couple of boundaries lol,7
beamer boy,3
Everytime FLICK is shown on screen the L and I are so dangerously close that it looks like FUCK.,5
Saini thinking about joining the Dinda Academy.,-10

Robappa's stance looks so uncomfortable. Ugh.,1

As per replay Stokes gonna need IODEX™ after that yorker,6
Thought there was an edge. Tf.,7
Shahbaz will bowl now?,4
Who is the new person in dugout,3
Can we please have Uthappa back? We will give you the shitster Rana.,3

Uthhapa fit back in his spot like an old shoe.,3
Robin opening essentially added an extra batsman to RR.  Now put Butler on top and Stokes at 5,4
I just shouted thinking Uthappa was out.,2
Sharman got off the coke in the second ad it seems. Much more subdued.,1
First Tripathi and now Uthappa showing their teams that they don't to fuck around with the natural positions of the batting order.,2

So they ask where is ABD best at? Outfield or keeping? Then they try to skew the answers by showing a clip where he was a beast in the outfield. ABD keeping brings more balance to the RCB team.,7

That was a clever ball. Decent amounts of sidespin taking it wide. Third time he's done this in 2020 so far.,1

Lol Sanju said he doesn't want to change his natural game.,6
I sensing Koach might not ask Chahal to bowl again until 20th.,6
Buttler still comes in the 7th over,8
Simple chess by Chahal. Remember how he dismissed Dhoni? Samson doesn't.,3
"This is exactly why Samson sucks, there was no reason to play that shit Shot. You Already Got a Six in the Over, plus the last ball was a wicket where batter went for a six and was caught. Defending it or Taking a Single would be the Obvious choice but no let's fucking gooo. Then Mallu bois will say keralite Discrimination",10
"It’s ok, it’s just another ploy for Tewatia to save the day",6
Wickets like this makes me feel IPL is fixed. Why would anyone go for that shot? Just after the fall of  wicket. Fuck this shit.,2

"Samson is Afridi, would rather score 6s than run runs",15
Truly brain dead cricket. You got a six in the first ball. Uthappa going big was a bad idea and Samson doing the same very next ball is downright stupid. RR throwing away a great start in just two balls,11

Is unmukt chand real,1
Samson is so dumb,3
I hope Parag shows what he's got this innings..,2
Sanju Samson is an awful Cricketer. I have no idea why people give him so many chances. There is a reason he is not even the best batsmen for his own domestic team in the Ranji Trophy. And people think he is on the doorstep to play for India,12
Pant > Samson and its not close,10
"Sanju Samson is extremely inconsistent, even in IPL. That was an absolute mindless shot, that too right after the wicket.",11
I really cannot stress this enough. Chahal is one of the smartest bowlers in world cricket.,4

That shade gonna be nice for who ever is fielding there,2
who's that new guy on DUGOUT?,2
Butler with that ethical leave to avoid the hattrick.,1
"I love how so many people claim Sanju Samson is somehow more talented in terms of pure batsmenship, than plenty of other Indian batsmen who look less good when they bat, or can clear the rope less easily.

It's such a base level analysis. If a batsman can only play one tempo, one way, struggles against high quality pace, and has no temperament, it doesn't make him talented and mercurial, it makes him an elegant slogger. Which is fine for T20s in the right team, but don't make it more than it is.",5
Bets on Rajastan being more than 5 down before reaching 100,5
"Well Jos, wanting to watch you bat is now the only thing standing between me and playing Cricket 2005 on PS2...so you know, either way here, I’m gonna be alright.

Also Cricket 2005 assures me I can play this new t20 phenomenon that is sweeping the world....in still not sure it’ll catch on too be honest..",7

There were these snippets of Samson that said he had taken extra training to play long innings during the lockdown. No amount of training can help you play a long innings if you don't have the mental temperament for it.,18
This is perfect batting order from RR. Sanju Samson ruined the good start.,7

These two need to see the next 5-6 overs out without doing anything crazy.",16
"Not only did Samson try to take on RCB's best bowler,  but he did so when 

> He had already hit a six on the first ball of the over 

> Uthappa perished trying to hit a six off the previous ball 

> Right after the powerplay, when what's needed is milking runs off the spinners 


Layers of stupidity to what he just did. Good luck staking a claim to play for India.",55
"If Stupid sexy butler does AB today, he no sexy no more",8
Samson has made 77 runs in last 7 innings at an average of 11.00 and strike rate of 105.47. He really needs to turn it around this season otherwise questions on his consistency are not gonna subside.,21
Bat samson at no. 11 because even they play brain dead shots and their contribution to the team is bonus,14
"Last time chahal dismissed Dhoni, dugout showed an analysis how he sucked Dhoni into a false slog by pitching it wide. Samson fell for the same trap. Unbelievable!",13
Samson should get a last go at this as an opener,14
Steve Smith taking the modern Bradman thing way too seriously and reversing the batting order,14
"No one:

Absolutely no one:

My PC every 15 minutes : ""Okay, 123 motherluvvers be around yaa""",18
"Scoring rate is still pretty high, should try to keep them under 160",5
"Left hand - Right hand combination is a luxury but not a necessity. Hope teams realise this and send players according to the position they generally play and not over complicate things.

In short - Buttler and Uthappa should open and Ben should go back to No.5, just the order they generally played in their career.",5
"Stokes opening for right-left combination makes no sense, because if he gets out, you have only Tewatia as the other left hander to maintain that. If you are perfectly fine with Butler and Smith playing in the middle through the middle overs, no reason why you shouldn't have Robin and Butler opening, with Stokes at his usual #5.",6
Worst Kingfisher ad ever in the IPL,2
"You can see how talented Samson his but his decision making is so off. Your team has won like 1 in 5 and this is a must win to get into the playoffs. Chahal is their best bowler and 7 runs already off the over with a wicket. Surely, you just play sensibly instead of bringing two new players and slogging it",11
I really shouldn't be enjoying Samson failing this much but people (both this sub and actual professional commentators) calling for Samson to replace Pant after 2 good innings makes this so much funnier,10

Redeem yourself smudge.,2
A leg slip??,2
The decision making of this team has to be attributed to some extent to the coaching and captaincy,3
buttler and smith look too uncomfortable,1
I still can't get over how someone who debuted as a spinner became the next Bradman. That's some sports movie level shit.,12
Anybody else feels Samson is trying too hard? He looks good and then gets out before even crossing the double digit playing a totally unnecessary shot. Not to take anything from Chahal but that ball should not be given wicket when you have already hit a six off the over.,6
"I'm seeing a pattern, whenever Gambhir compliments someone, shit happens. Nitish Rana, SKY (last game only) and Sanju lol",2

Lol. Smith is looking clueless.,2
I blame Samson for how they're playing spinners now.,3
I think RCB should try Parthiv Patel for at least one match,1
'Needs to get that average up a little bit more' a LITTLE bit??!! The SR of a top order batsman means nothing if hes getting out from single figures every game from playing a dumb shot,10

Chad Chahal here bowling some of the slowest deliveries I have seen in this IPL.,8
It’s okay ... I prefer go big or go home players like Samson than these run accumulator types (which you’ll find dime a dozen in India ) who save their wicket till the 18th over and then decide to go big . Samson needs to be supported and be given a long rope.,-1
Wasn't Shahbaz Nadeem in SRH?,1
how was that not a wide lmao,4
"As a SRH fan, I'm unsure on who to support this match. RCB losing might open up the 3rd spot, RR losing would make it easier in the race for 4th spot. Any help here?",2
Jaiswal in for Samson. Sure the Mallus can keep whining on social media but he has been consistently underwhelming for quite a long time now. Inject some new blood,11
Chahal's ability to lure the batsman into playing the big shot is honestly unparalleled.,10
Bloody hell,2
SPD is looking like a free wicket .,6
"Only hope for RR is buttler

Pretty sure smith will get out with another brainfade",7
Want Kohli to score a 30 ball 100 today,1
"On paper, this batting line up looks as good as Mumbai’s",6
RR have almost fixed their batting order,3
Too full from Shahbaz,2
That was smooth,3
"**Sanju Samson in this season**

159 off 74 in the first two games

77 off 73 in the next seven games",20
if I see anyone praising buttler it’s on fucking sight,3
"Robin showed today he can still open

Buttler is one of the best openers around in T20 cricket

Just fucking open with them both",39
"They reason India doesn't give chances to players like samson, SKY is because they always get cocky after 1 good match and play stupid shots. Paddikal has more probability of making it in the squad",12
"Samson just blue balling entire Rajasthan, Kerala and cricket lovers all over the world since 2013. Now this is slowly leading to erectile dysfunction.",14
"It looks like the commentators have been instructed by the broadcaster to sell this line hard : ""from the comfort of your homes""",9
170 should be good enough,5
God I LOVE Jos,8
"Buttler scooped a 156 ball the prev game, man is the most aggressive batsmen in t20s but by sending him in the middle you are absolutely dismantling his natural game. Its just a plain weird decision",8
"I'm sorry to say, Shahbaz isn't looking very promising to me. I hope I'm wrong tho.",4
Buttler just too good. And it looked so smooth and low risk!,8
Get Buttler out now or get fucked,18
Stokes opened again? Uthappa made nearly 50? Wtf am I looking at? They still depending on Tewatia?,11
Smith looks like he'll get out every ball,10
"Without looking at his history, Shabaz looks like a player who came from humble beginnings.",14
Buttler is my favourite batsman after AB,11
Ab screaming Shabaz lowkey gave me Pakistani keeper vibes lmao,16
[deleted],14
Smart batting from Smith to farm the strike to Buttler,6
Samson losing his mind trying to comprehend the art of taking singles after hitting a six,13
Couldn't RCB have just played Negi instead of Shahbaz?,8
There is no odi or test version of buttler. He just wacks as he likes it.,3
This is the best time for Smith to bat. He looks shot with his form so just stay in and try to rebuild after some quick wickets.,6
Shivam Dube died for this?,9
Is Virat using Shabaz as a part timer to squeeze some overs in?,5
"*Player plays 2 good innings*

r/Cricket: Is this guy Bradman ?",56
samson needs to be dropped,6
Smudge please captain's innings we need you rn,4
"Yes. Play the middle over like this and slog in the death, we'll get a good score",7
"12 overs and the openers are still at crease, only rcb can do this",11
"Still can’t believe Uthappa’s remarkable innings
Robin>>batman, sometimes",5
I think playing for a well settled team like MI would do sanju a whole lot of good. There would be rohit opening ahead of him and players like pollard and pandya coming after him. But don't think this brain dead shot selection is going to make a team like MI to consider him.,5
Looks like almost the entire RCB team got a haircut/shave after last match.,8
I want any cricketer to react to r/cricket match thread,20
"Something really wrong with Samson. He needs a sports psychologist to figure out what causes him to sperg out so bad after a couple of good innings

The talent is undeniable. The mindset needs a change",18
Will Gurkeerat get to bat today?,7
Masterclass in spin bowling from DMboi,5
Adil Rashid has to play in the IPL,8
Swann is the first commentator who doesn't make me cringe when  promoting the sponsor on air. His humor makes most things seem alright.,15
Chahal is showing his class,7
Always wonder why the likes of Samson and Sundar don’t go and play in English county cricket. Would help them so much,17
"Samson should open if gonna play like that, only 2 fielders outside will help him the way he plays",11
God damn it Samson why would you do that. So frustrating to watch,12
Seeing a good flipper after a long time.,4
Chahal exists. Commentators:Chatur Chalak goes brr,24
imagine playing all batsmen at their stock positions and giving them time to excel. Imagine,34
Archer hydrating himself like anything.,9
What a weird shot from Smithy lol,13
The discussion over Samson reminds me of the discussion around Rohit's talent at around 2010,12
Find a girl who can tease you in bed the same way Chahal teases the batsmen,45
Sundar is overrated,-8
wht an over?,3
"Is it just me or does Chahal bowl better for RCB than he's done for India recently?

Too often, I've seen him bowl very flat and defensively for India. He's more attacking for RCB, tosses it up, bowls slower and takes more risks which is how he gets his wickets",12
Archer should draw back an arrow and fire it when he takes a wicket.,3
I'm worried about the Aus-Ind series after seeing Smith's form the last few games. Pls Smithy get back into form.,2
[deleted],-5
"Finally seeing Smudger playing the way he should in T20. He can easily manufacture a single to any ball, rotate the strike and hit the occasional boundary when there's a bad ball. Let Jos do the heavy hitting.",3
"Really good battle between these batsmen and Chahal. Bowler seems to be predicting what they want to do quite well, but equally then know if they play him out they can target everyone else.",5
CSK 3rd in that table shows how fair the fair play award is .,35
"Smith is either going to hit six or get out in this over, isn't he?",4
The amount of talent that now England have is just insane.,12
Wtf finch has such a good left arm,8
"Have smith back at 3, Samson opening, butler at 4, Stokes at 5 and you're golden",5
I'm scared once the quicks come in.,5
Samson should just come 4 or 5 down and do some slogging if this is the case.,3
180-200 easily. Buttler has already played 20 balls. Give him another 25 to go bang bang.,5
"I know everyone wants to watch the lord bat, but if there are only 2-3 overs remaining, I think Archer might be a better call",11
Finally Smith playing to his strengths,10
[deleted],-9
"imagine practicing bowling skills on ground day in and day out and whenever you excel, all the credit goes to a board game you played as a child..",6
Steve Smith finally scores double digit runs outside Sharjah after scoring **3 5 6 5 1**,7
Is the pitch getting slower or is it our boys bowling so well?,5
Bappi da is literally gold,6
"Looking at how Chahal has grown, Kuldeep's decline looks even more stark",16
At first I thought how did Shahbaz Nadeem managed to become even skinnier and bit taller,5
Bring back Udana for a couple of overs?,2
Who remembers Steven Afridi from Pune Warriors era?,4
There s something about the way finchy throws a ball,3
"Smith looks like he is gonna trip and fall while batting, but never does.",10
[deleted],16
This is gonna be a wicket or a big over. Nothing in between.,4
Good decision by Smudge to stop batting like a tailender and start batting like Thala,19
Lord has a lot of rage within him. He is more of an anti-hero rather than a hero.,2
Why would you get Saini on when chahal was strangling them so hard,1
Magnum vs Ultra?,1
"Paddle shots, dilscoops coming in 3..2..",4
Altroz! Quick switch to dugout!,4
What do you guys think of dominic cork so far?,7
i hope kohli remembers to finish chahal,21
"RR still in a good position even after consecutive wickets thanks to Uthappa's innings, they just need to be sensible and keep getting 6-7 runs per over till 16th and then they have enough talent to accelerate",5
Does Chahal have a tooth missing?,10
"If koach uses some braincells, morris and saini death combo is quite formidable, definitely don't want to save udana till then",5
"Wtf, that angry Dhoni stare at the umpire didn't cost them any fair play points?",23
Smith is weirdest cricketer i have ever seen.,9
You know there’s something wrong with this game when Uthappa was the most interesting player,5
Smith shouldn't hit anything in the air till the 17th over.,5
Fuckin A Samson. Dig back out of that hole for once. Really put out the flames of this innings,7
A career as a car salesman looks unlikely for Cork.,4
The marketing team at Tata Motors should show some sympathy and put these guys out of their misery.,4
Why didn't Dominic Cork play more?,1
"fuck this, I wanna see Saini breaking Tewatia's ribs once more",3
"Samson is an example in how cricket is a very mental game, RR came in with the approach of hitting spin based on a very good powerplay but with utthappa's wicket instead of giving Chahal the he deserves respect, at least till the end of the over, he decides to do a broken record player and do the same shit without any thought.",10
No INTENT? Interesting. Thought this would be a big over or a wicket tbh,11
Chad Jofra Archer with that 160 Strike Rate,8
"I feel like Biden saying ""Would you shut up, man?"" when I hear these commentators yapping about that shitty car",12
That earnest plugging of a hatchback is the funniest thing I've heard all day.,12
"This is what Smith should have done whole tournament. Playing in the middle order, rotating strike and building an inning.",11
Ho do you configure a bot that wakes you up if you fall asleep in a match ?,7
Saini has been poor this season,1
"180 on the cards, if these guys stay till the 17th over.",0
Why does Steve Smith always play well against teams captained by Virat?,1
Why do you guys actually think about Altroz? Is it a good car?,0
What are Smith's memorable T20 innings? Either IPL or for Australia?,0
"Other than Jofra, that RR bowling line up is completely unreliable. Anyone in the line up can concede a 20 run over on a given day..",1
"Hot take:  


Virat Singh >> Virat Kohli",1
I thought Raju Rastogi was poor,1
Smith has to start taking a few risks here.,0
"RR should make samson open  
 
At least his aerial shots won't go straight to fielders",6
Decent foundation in place. They need to go for 50-60 in the last 5 overs.,2
"Saini keeps cutting across the non striker after each delivery, might lead to collisions",0
Why did they change the HDFC ad,3
"fuck this, I wanna see nokia bowling bullets at yellow oldies",13
Thing is Altroz is marketed as the Safest Hatchback and the madlads say everything except that,6
With Archer in red hot form. Finch will definitely be shit today.,3
that was comical from shteve,1
Why not finish the spin,1
Dubai looks so... lifeless,5
Smith has been trying to hit the ball too hard this IPL.,6
I like that the fake crowd noise varies depending on what sport I'm watching. It's actually quite nuanced.,11
Uthappa looking smug having guaranteed his spot for the next match,3
"Udana should've been a batsman, very unfortunate name for a bowler",10
lol.. umpire fielding the ball for the bowler,4
180 is tough bois,2
"Udana is such a sycophant, he points to Kohli everytime he gets a wicket",6
Let's go smudge,3
Wow that shot was brilliantl,3
RR looks much better today. Uthappa doing his job opening. Smith doing his job accumulating. Now buttler and remaining batsmen need to close,2
Hope Gurkeerat Singh gets to bat today.,6
No doubt that was a bad delivery,4
Robbie did play some tasty shots tho ngl,5
"Teams when Sanju comes on to bat:

**Oh no**

**Anyway**",10
Steve Smith 30 watch,-1
"Chahal & Sundar bowling at an economy of 5 in the middle overs.

Kohli brings in Udana.


Me to Kohli - ""Why dada, why?""",6
Want smith to have an amazing innings,2
"What a shit ball from Udana. Short and wide outside off, but also sooo slow",6
Udana sus,4
Wtf was that ball,2
Yo Udana whatchu doin,3
Bruh how does Smith's arms don't pop out of his body.,3
Dafaq is Udana doing,2
Udana bowling some shit,3
Thank you for your generosity Udana,3
Lol what are you bowling udana?,3
Shittiest fucking bowling ever.,2
Does RCB have no other international fast bowler?,1
Shit bowling this! Bowl to you effing field mate!,3
"Calling Udana overseas ""pro"" is a bit generous",9
I love how disappointed Ian Bishop gets at bad bowling,8
Chudana what the hell are you bowling?,3
Its time for RCB to concede 200 from here.,2
Anything that Smith does looks so weird,6
what trash is this,6
Udana is not the sharpest tool in the shed,6
This is dreadful bowling. Brain dead really.,9
RCB testing out Steve Smith's short and wide technique,2
"Udana, what's up dude? 🤷",3
Udana emulating siraj.,2
Shit bowling,1
Udana wants to fill in for Siraj,7
Anyone else miss Sanjay Manjrekar commentary lol?,0
"Just realised I've been casually watching the IPL for ages but don't have a team. I tend to just watch to see how the Aussies are going.

Do Aussie fans pick and stick? Or do you just float around?",8
Good guy Udana bowling Smith into form.,12
Udana what is you doing bb?,9
Udana is srilankan version of unadkut,11
Is it just me or has Udana's form just nosedived the last couple of games.,4
What's udanas plan here,5
That was 8 runs gifted to Steve Smith honestly,4
"With the great Unadcan't in our arsenal, we need at least 180.",5
Udana doing what his name suggests,10
Udana being umesh!,7
This is a big brain match. Players truly playing some dumb cricket at times,7
If RCB wins today CSK and SRH will be happy otherwise RR may  over take them,5
180-190 from here,5
"When u get smacked by Robbie, u lose all confidence for the day",12
"kohli, in his infinite knowledge, has decided to keep chahal for the death",11
Udana is in the team only because he's benchmarked against siraj and umesh,2
RR start smacking NOWW !!,2
Incoming RCB choke.,4
What would RCB's bowling attack look like with Kane Richardson in?,3
What's a good score on this wicket? 175 odd?,2
RR will reach 200 here. Too easy,1
Indian players should also be given tennis coaching to hit shots like this,2
Udana is RCB's finisher don't worry,5
Udana I'm sorry bud just because you hang with Chris Morris you can't start bowling short. You need to stick to your guns and bowl yorkers and variations.,9
Play Steyn instead of Udana!,1
James Bond drinking Heineken. We've seen it all.,3
Any news on Iyer’s injury btw?,2
Finish chahal pls,2
Wtf is happening,4
Get a move on,6
RCB missing Siraj. Decides Udana should bowl it.,5
Spirit of Sir Umesh lives on,4
HOLY FUCK SMITH,5
200 it is,3
Dang that was smoked,4
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Steven Smith is back!!!",5
"Noice, Smudge",3
"Me: Butler is attacking and Smith is slow.

Looks at scorecard

Butler 24 of 24 and Smith 25 of 19.

Me: (ง’̀-‘́)ง",9
Chahal still has an over wtf,6
Smudge is that you?,3
What a 6 from Smith,5
Smith you fucking beauty🥰,4
Smith will love the faster bowlers now.,5
What a shot,2
RR need at least 60 from the last 5,5
HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE,4
I took a half she took t he whole thing slow down,2
RCB gonna bottle the chase. I can feel it. Archer gonna smother us.,4
that Backlift,3
"Danny Morrison almost said ""Holy shit"" xD",6
"Get Lord in the 17th over and coast to 200, we're counting on you RR",2
Ah yes finish Morris now and save chahal for the death im sure it'll work,7
**TONKED**,2
This match is so weird. Smith is playing at a better  sr than butler.,4
fuck u kohli wheres chahal,5
Crappy slot ball from Morris there,2
"I want that bat on ball noise as my text tone, beautiful",4
"Wtf Steve, where was this in 2017?",4
They never showed if the ball went for six in kamala pasand ad but they show people celebrating. That's direction for all the kids out there watching,6
Smith with a strike rate over 150 after that start,5
Chahal for 20th again? ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯,5
"We did it Bois, we memed Robbie and smudge into form",5
What a cracking unacademy 6,7
RCB brought back Both smith and uthappa back in to form. Nice.,6
We're not winning this.,0
"Brought Uthappa into form, now bringing Smith back into form. Helping our fellow Royals out, we are such a generous team.",10
Requesting help to clean up the jizz in the commentary box.,2
Keep bowling Shahbaz to Smith,1
Tewatia and Archer left to bat. These guys gotta whack,1
Smith playing with complete confidence after getting plenty of time to bat himself in. Just shows how important that knock from Uthappa was.,3
Sees Buttler 24(24)- Look how they massacred my boy,2
"Best tools to get someone into form. 

1. R/cricket
2. Cricviz",13
Damn what a welcome to Morris,2
Chahal should be bowling this over!,4
Wtf that wasn't a Wide,3
Samson should learn from Smudge rn,3
He looked sharp since the toss to me. Stevie smith poppin off,2
Congrats on the 2 points RR,0
I love dugout because they even don't know if its a six or a catch.,5
"Just give one more over to Udana, please VK",0
Did coach get someone to sprint from square leg to point wtf,1
Seemed like Butler was playing all the shots but smith is going at 150 and Butler only at 100,6
Udana and Morris competing on who should be successor of Umesh to join Dinda Academy,-17
"Oh lord, we ded.",3
Can't keep a world class player like Smith down for long.,1
Lmao the only team that could bring Smith back in form is rcb,0
Nice,2
Umpire cannot resist Butler's puppy dog eyes,3
naww :'(,3
Aaand Butler is out,1
"Jio: Your data carries forward to the next month

Koach: Can Chahal bowl 5 overs today?",7
So lord Tewatia is coming?,5
"BC uske sir ke upar se gaya hai ball, the Dhoni effect on umpires already started.",5
Time for Lord Tewatia??,2
fuck :(,2
Thank fuck,4
Welp Buttler didn't play well,6
Oh no Jos this ain't it,8
"Is no one going to notice that this guy’s name is ISRO UDANA and he plays for rcb 


Isro’s headquarter is in bangalore

/s",15
Looks like they've decided to go for it. About time!,6
Oh no not the lord,17
"Oh no, Lord incoming",14
Buttler was totally wasted.,8
"Exhibit 45000 of why ""get set for 25 balls and then hit"" is a bad strategy.",11
so rcbs highest wicket taker isnt gonna finish his quota for the third time this season??,15
Yay! Go RCB,8
Lord time?,2
How accurate is the Dugout overall ? Haven't seen last week's stats,5
Yayyyy! Go Morris Baby!!,7
Butler played like Smith and smith playing like Butler.,16
That was a disappointing innings by Buttler. Over to Smith and the rest...,8
"**15.3** Morris to Buttler, OUT, **taken at mid-off.** Morris was brought back for the wicket, and he's got the biggest one. **127-4**

JC Buttler c Saini b Morris 24 (25b 1x4 1x6) SR: 96.00",3
Morris is really good with short balls,5
Dhoni lite incoming,9
Dugout is hilarious to watch,5
Shieet buttler gone for < 100 strike,6
Buttler and Stokes better off swapping places. Sort of proved now,13
It’s Tewatia time babyyy,7
"Morris is such an important bowler for RCB tbh. Whenever VK needs a wicket, he calls him on, and he just gets him a wicket somehow.",17
"Archer will belt isuru anna for 4 sixes in the penultimate over, you heard it here first",10
Lord bless us with your batting!!!,2
"After DK was fired from captaincy, Smith realised he could be the next one.",11
Excellent stuff from Morris.,3
No ad breaks in the dugout for the second timeout of the innings.  One of the many reasons I love it.,3
"Jos couldn't clear 30 yards circle with that hit, that's how bad the timing was!",3
Buttler was the imposter,4
Who is in the blue and pink in dugout select?,2
"morris has changed complete team around for RCB, A proper allrounder.",7
Buttler sacrificing his wicket so the lord himself shall play,10
Release the Tewatia!,4
Is Stoinis the only Australian performing well in the IPL?,2
What is a par score for RR's bowling? 170-180?,2
Chahal and Morris carrying this bowling attack rn,3
Guys am I anti national for liking Buttler and Smith?,-5
This pitch is nicer for batting than everyone expected. If AB gets going and Kohli bats with at least some urgency (not guaranteed) then RCB have a chance.,2
Buttler should open with Robbie. That would be the final opening combination lol,4
"Sanju samson when asked how are you feeling seeing smith and Uthappa get some form??
“Apne ko kya hai...apne ko bas ek six marna h”",10
"Please make some silly decisions, RCB management, please",5
RR's finally batting well,7
Lord is here,5
Swaney is scottys biggest cheer leader,3
[deleted],11
Send Buttler at the top idiots!,4
Katich telling kohli he should bowl himself for maximum surprise.,10
These run-a-ball 20-30s are the worst kind of innings from a team perspective,9
They should send archer,2
Adam Griffith is a BIG UNIT,3
"If ben can't bat in the middle and he is causing the shuffle of jos, then he has to sit out. He doesn't even bowl his full spell.",12
"People calling out Buttler, the guy is playing in the middle and has been given the opposite role of what he is best at. If anything the management shat the bed, it's not Buttlers fault at all",4
Chahal still not completing his quota before death overs yet again. What a brainless strategy,1
Smith is batting well,0
Chew Kamla Pasand and help your team win,0
Why do batsmen keep spitting?,2
Who's the guy next to Katich?,0
Should've sent in Archer here tbh,4
"Thanks udana, for giving smith nice momentum.",4
"U switch Buttler's and stokes position and u get sr less than 100 from each, who would've thought??",21
The lord is in the field,5
Why am I hearing boss music?,6
"Before the wicket 


This sub : Where is Chahal ?????


After the wicket


This sub : Morris is the best thing since sliced bread :p",9
Lord have mercy,5
Hi guys I just tuned in and what the f#ck is this batting order of Royals?,3
"Lord after seeing RR having a chance: fine, I'll do it myself",1
"uttappa and jos to open  
stokes to bat in the middle order

 with all the data they still cant figure this out.",9
Really hope we are privileged enough to see a RCB batting special.,6
I am feeling bad for our bowlers in Australia. Smith is gonna just tire them into submission.,9
It's LORD time,3
Robin and smiths batting prove why where you bat is important.,10
Lord Koachli seems to have forgotten that Chahal has an over left.,2
Overs 16 and 17 should be bowled by a spinner. Neither are big hitters against spin.,11
Can't imagine morris with nortje and rabada. Too much power. Gald they released him,12
[deleted],2
"Smith is in the zone. 

He could score a 50 today",2
Absolute meme would be RCB not qualifying the playoffs from here.,10
Tewatia is wall mart jadeja,10
Smith looks like himself now. I'm happy for now but will be sad for the test series,4
Uthappa & Stokes were developing great partnership & then Morris takes wicket. Smith & Buttler batting well.. who takes wicket- Morris takes wicket. Brilliant player for RCB,6
Stop bowling near Tewatia's pads idiot. Keep the ball away from him.,1
"Ian Bishop saying the word "" lexicon*. My day is made",11
Lord is here,2
Lord vs Chahal.. That's what i want to see!,8
Chahal vs Tewatia,1
Hey Hotstar give the people a Lord Tewatia sticker you cowards,3
Morris after taking next wicket pls say ' Tum sub BC ho'.,2
Why can’t RR open with Butler and Robbie ?,5
finally. THIS is Steve Smith. This is that modern day Bradman type game. Let's see if he can finish,9
"Sorry but Archer should come next, not Parag.",4
Lol the commentators is saying Pollard hasn't done much for Mumbai in couple of seasons before the last.,6
What do they reckon par score is? 180ish?,2
Sorry but Parag had to be on the pitch instead of tewatia. This will damage his confidence.,1
"""Anti-Viral technology"" seriously?",6
[deleted],11
Smith being the aggressor in a partnership with Buttler was unexpected,2
Why not bowl Chahal,6
I want both saini and tewatia to do well. :(,2
**LTT**,1
Is chahal refusing to bowl,2
C'mon man! Need to bowl Chahal out!,4
Looks like lord is in the zone today,1
How is rr doing rn?,1
Swann seems obsessed with Tewatia to the point it almost feels creepy.,3
So how many runs will Lord Tewatia make today? Right guess will get a small award from me let's see then!,7
Seeing quick singles against VKs team feels gooood,2
Lord already striking at 100.... Rcb is ded,5
RR need some Anti Virat technology today,3
/r/Cricket is more fickle than the Google live win probability.,9
Pretty sure kohli wants chahal to bowl the last over after what he did last match,11
Absolute power move would be to ask Chahal to bowl the last over as he did pretty well last match,6
these reviews LOL,6
Slide the bat bhenchod,11
Seriously are these umpires dumb?,22
Fire the umpire ffs,10
"Holy fuck umpi, wtf do you even get paid for",13
Umpires don’t go upstairs for stuff like caught behinds and edges but go up for blatant non run outs. Talk about “wasting time”,9
"If ball hits the stumps, overthrows shouldn't be allowed. Dead ball. 

Literally penalizing the team/player for being a good fielder",-4
Third Umpire Assault Rifle,5
Ffs these entitled umpires getting paid for doing jack shit,10
Going to 3rd umpire when not just the bat but both his feet are in 😂😂😂,8
Come on we really don't need the third umpire for this,4
There's something so satisfying about bails flying straight up in slow motion,1
"I don't get why people dunk on middle over, run a ball innings as bad things, especially after quick successive wickets. They add stability and crucial runs towards the scoreboard that the team can build up on in the death overs.

People would rather have an almost certain collapse than be 10-15 runs short?",2
[deleted],2
"Man Smith get the 50, you deserve it soooo much",17
Six next ball ?,2
Umpires should be fined for shit like this. This is not all that different from a slow over rate,19
"Tewatia is following in Kohli/Dhoni footsteps as spectators are less sad about losing the previous wicket Buttler, instead more exited about Tewatia innings.",10
How tf are csk third after all the shit they've done,13
"Suggestion: if they're gonna refer every single runout upstairs, the third umpire should immediately look at the footage without the 30 second delay of the onfield umpires deciding whether they should send it upstairs or not.",9
Kohli's captaincy has been very good today.,5
RR down in 8th coz of Tewatia fuel with Khaleel lol,6
Dhoni could literally murder the umpire and CSK would still be towards the top of the fair play award,19
100D chess by Koach to keep 4 overs of spin available to bowl at the lord,10
"Only time KKR will be at the top of the table, the fair play award.",3
Cameraman still on Ambani payment zooming in cinematically on MI logo 🙄,7
"Can someone explain to be WTF does it mean to ""uphold the spirit of the game""? How is this calculated?",10
Is it  pronounced तेवतिया?,10
Does the shadows of the stadium distract the players?,11
When was the last time Smudge bowled leg spin?,2
Excellent by Saini.,5
"I am nervous for Smith, the way I am nervous for Virat when Virat plays for India.",7
"Man saini’s first 2 overs went for 21, and last 2 for just 9",5
" saini is economical. well, except the Delhi match",4
"Why is Delhi so low at Fairplay,  and the guy who didn't apologise after bowling beamers higher lol",2
scenes if the third umpire asked to rock n roll that shit,8
"If that is what the fair play award is about, how are CSK in 3rd? 😂😂😂",6
Morris 1 chahal 1 udana 1??,2
Chennai should be at bottom of Fair Play,3
Bowl chahal! Tewatia struggles against spin,2

"You fucking idiot, why would you bowl Chahal now FFS",3
"That cutie is Chahal 's gf , isn't she?",7
Smith with big dick energy,1
Oh smith,2

Now you know why he befriended Warner.,5
Steve Smith really can do it all 😍,0
Who dat cutie in the RR camp?,4

"Yuzvendra Chahal, RCB’s specialist death bowler",11
Confidence dekh rahe ho launde kaa,8
Smith looks so innocent in that photo 🥺,6
Looks like our lord has given smudge a piece of his mind,3
"Lord gets what he demands, the spin",3
It's amazing how much better Smith looks when he's not trying to utterly dominate bowlers,8
Smith has played captain's knock,2
Umpire trying to prevent Smith and chahal bumping fists. Dafuq?,-1
Why don't the select commentators get the different camera angles simultaneously?,0
Lord tewatia vs chess playing tiktoker,4
Saini may not be picking wickets but he has been really economical in the past 4 games,4
Who is that fielder with the French beard?,0
Man Chahal as a person is pretty cool ig.,3
Absolutely love that this man is the best test batsman of our generation,3
Good guys RCB bringing Uthappa and Smith back in form,5
Will Tewatia employee the reverse sweep against Chahal?,1
"Happy to see that Smudge is back in business. He shouldn't feel the need to play huge shots at the beginning, just needs to take the singles and 2s and then accelerate towards the end. He has loads of big hitters around him to find the boundaries anyway, his job is as an anchor",7
Need Kohli to play a blinder today.,5
Smith saved his captaincy and place in the side for the rest of the season.,9
"Omg step bro smith, stop, what are you doing",10
GG SMITH,1
Shit,2
Smith trying to impress the lord,6

Gond tod di Chahal ki.,5
"Smudge reached a 50, I can’t believe my eyes",3
"When he's bowling well, he doesn't get an over in the middle overs. Now kohli bowls him. Has me lost his mind?",3
Smith in his territory,2
"I think star should use that fielding map for broadcast they showing in dugout. Every time ball is outside 30 yard circle, commentators start its a boundary, when it is going to a fielder's hand directly.",4
Chahal is not a death bowler you idiots,7
Insult to injury. Chahal 's figures getting ruined here,5
This is the Steve Smith we are used to seeing...,3
"Well played Smith ,now hit every thing",3
Smith striking a 50 at 160,3
Why spin now FFS !,1

Oh no. Oh no. That's why you bowl Chahal before the death,2
How does a spinner in a T20 bowl a no ball,3
2016 Semi PTSD,1
"As a Smith fan, yay. As a RCB and India fan, yikes",4
Big shout out to RCB for getting Smith back into form,4
No ball? Not so chatur chalaak from the grandmaster,4
Lmao Smith dead ass held his hands up when he heard the sirens,19
"Guess who's back, back again, Smudge is back, tell your friend.",3
"Lord Nehra saying ""abhi chakkon ki zarurat nahi hai"" 🤦",4
Finally. Been desperate to see Smith succeed in the IPL.,2
"How tf does a spinner bowls a no ball.

Fixed

Criminal from Chahal to overstep like bruh,1
If only smith had played like this throughout the ipl,2
Who took the catch?,2
You can't take RCB out of RCB,5
Solid innings from Smith. This was long time coming.,1
RCB and RCB-A team are given the responsibility to bring out of form players into form..,4

Padikkal has got a very safe pair of hands,8
Very difficult to chase 170+,6

It’s a pure crime if a spinner bowls a no ball,17
Lord 😳,5
imagine scoring 50 after a string of low scores. Yeah are you reading this samson!?,15
"That was a nice catch, even tho it does not count.",5
Finch to get fucked so hard by archer. Hope he finally gets dropped.,2
i never understood how or why a spinner bowls a no ball,3
180 on the cards,2
Tewatia can only hot on legside? He should give strike to well settled Smith.,4
Bruh that Noball siren feels like a nuclear siren,6
That palti shot from lord is dot ball proof even if the ball doesn't connect,4
Smith is a mad man,3
Wow SPD just wow,2
absolute domination,2
Smith is so good man,2
Fuck me Smithy what a shot,6
Fuck off Koach you retard.,5
"Smith to Tewatia: Look at me, i'm the Lord now",9
Holy shit that shot was just insanely good,4
180 possible,5
The disrespect,5
"21 off that over, that's big",5
Smudge showing his class.,2
Bruh Smith plays the most weird shots of all time,5
"Can we please, please have abd as captain? I'm done with this bullshit.",3
Masterclass from Koach to take Chahal off when he was on fire and have him bowl the 18th over,7
Tewatia is so good he doesn't even need to hit the ball to get runs,2
Smith 😨,2
WTF,1
Aussies livid seeing Smith playing these shots. Confirming their fears Stokes and Buttler are out to corrupt him so they can have a chance at winning the Ashes.,3
Ahhh how good does it feel to see Smith cunting the balls again,2
Oh god another one,1
*HOW??*,1
steve smith challenging the lord,3
FFS!,2
What. The. Fuck. Is this nerd doing out there? 😯,2
How do you even set a field for that lmao,3
Lol no ball again,3
Oh no chahal what arey you doing,2
Bc,2
Oh god. Oh god no.,2
Not again ffs,3
isnt that a wide?,1
"Sorry, what was that?",1
Oh no! Not again lmao,1
I still don't understand why you'd bowl Chahal in the 18th over? Istg if Kohli went to Chahal becuase of his last over against kxip,2
Bro *what*,2
"Chahal first 3 overs: 2-16

Chahal 4th over: 0-16",6
WTF Chahal,1
What happened to Chahal lmao.,3
Need a Steven Smith apology thread right now,3
OOOOF CHAHAL WTF,4

Never thought I would see smudge doing so many reverse sweeping,1
"Smudge showing buttler how to do it

Haha another one!,2
Lungi Ngidi flashbacks,5
Oh no yuzi,2

Thank you chahal,3
RCB trying so hard to lose this.,3
Lol damn!,1
Hahahah amazing,2
Smith has been secretly practising his reverse sweeps!,3
190+ incoming,2
"Koach couldn't stand a bowler having economy of less than 8, so gave it chahal in death overs",2
LMAO,2
Lmao suck off the chatur chalaak more now won't you,6
Bruh chahal should’ve been finished off earlier bruh,6
Two no balls for a spinner is absolutely inexcusable,11
Why yuzi why?,3
Lol Chahal what you doing bro,4
Don’t send this one to a fielder ffs,1
hahha no ball again my gawd,3
Lmao.,2
Smith will be determined to deposit this in the standa,2
Spinners bowling no balls is inexcusable,2
Petition to give motm to Uthappa despite Smith's 50,3
Seriously? Another No-ball,3
Chahal should literally be the first spinner to throw 2 no balls in one over lmao,7
How the fuck do you bowl multiple no balls in an over as a fucking spinner lmao,11
N ppl say ipl aint fixed /s,4
"*but right handers can't play leg spin* - RCB, probably

Smith: watch me switch hit, you idiots.",7
Lmao that was a wide,3
"lol That was Smith trademark, can't imagine anyone else playing it",3
This whole innings by RR makes it look like they were all just batting in the wrong order this whole time..,4
Bruh smudger,2
"Smith, toying with Chahal",1
We're never winning anything with Kohli as captain (of the national team),4
[deleted],5
Excellent free hit deliveries from Chahal. Very impressive,3
FBI open up,3
KOHLI what a joke of a captain!!!,3
ED raid incoming on Chahal,3
Chahal has been possessed by Umesh,5
Who's gonna bowl last two?? Udana and Morris?,2
That’s how games are lost,5
Yuzi liked the alarm the first time,3
Smith should forever play in the middle order in LO's. He's the perfect anchor.,3
How does a spinner bowl a no ball twice in the same over? smh,3
why tf,4
Two no balls. In an over. AS A SPINNER! Awful,6
Shit like this makes me think the ipl is actually fixed,3
KP called for Smith to be dropped LOL,4
Spinner bowling two no-balls in an over is shocking,3
chahal bowled better on free hits than normal deliveries this over,3
Can't find anyone braindead than Kholi at captaincy.,5
Uthappa and Chahal exchanged form,1
Yeah nice one rcb. Bowling chahal in deaths again idiots.,4
Smith playing champion innings here.He is the Smith we know,5
Great over. Let's get to 180 please :),5
Finish chahal's overs in the middle FFS,7
Smith weirdness at max setting. Absolutely loving it,3
2 noballs by spinner in 18th over 🧐 *Everything is fixed*,5
People who wanted Smith to give up the captaincy and get dropped from the team - please show yourself,3
What's more criminal? Spinner bowling 2 no balls or batsman managing to score 1 run off it?,4
Get ready for the udana spanking,4
"Last time chahal bowled the 18th over he gave away 23 runs, why the fuck would you bowl him again.",3
chahal at this point just keep bowling no balls. let this over never end,1
Indian bowlers under performing once again in the IPL,1
We are shit,5
Smudge is the most uncomfortable batsmen to watch but the guy when on song is something else,3
I didn't think Chahal bowled too many no balls. Suspicious.,3
The real chahal is in the trunk of Umesh. This is Umesh,3
"Poor Chahal. 2-11 from 3 overs and both batsmen on the ropes.

Genius from Koach to take him off then.",4
This one's gonna hurt more than the kxip match,7
"Smith back in his element.

Reverse sweeping on demand.",2
F to all the ppl who wanted Chahal to complete his quota,6
When do we see the lord hit?,1
Why will kohli bowl spinners at final phase of the innings? Every godamm time.,6
Udana bro no more short balls ffs,3
"So dumb, why didn't he bowl Chahal out when Buttler and Smith were looking to nudge him around for singles?",3
"I've basically never seen Smith hit a power reverse until this match but he's nailing it. Must've practiced it at least 1,000 times in the nets.",2
This was the role i had for Smith in my mind. Not the mindless slogging,1
"Chahal is not a death over bowler.

This just confirms it.",3
Godaddy Dhoni and Khatabook Dhoni looks the same.,-1
RR looking to score at least 20 off these last 12 balls?,2
Tewatia loves the left arm pacers,1
Smith the finisher,1
"Chahal 

3 overs : 15 runs

4th over : 19 runs",5
Only Koach would bowl chahal at the death because of last game,5
"Uthappa redemption complete.
Smith redemption complete.
Unadkat redemption loading?",0
"You have Saini, Morris and Udana. Yet the bowl them out and go to Chahal 😔",2
Why does Smith have porn hubs sticker lol,5
Chahal in death over experiment is gonna backfire big time someday. Should finish his overs in the middle overs,6
"Rcb : Right handers cant bat against leggies

Smith batting left handed to chahal",2
First 3 overs 16 runs. Last over 19. Bruh,2
Lol second will be no ball even chahal has not crossed line. Fielder left 30 yards circle even before the ball bowled,1
Anyone know who's the commentator with Harsha & Bish?,2
L O R D,5
Lord has striken,5

Lord Please Have Mercy!!!!,8

Ridiculous,2

Whatever the lord pleases,3
sanju samson sad at probably losing the super striker award this match,1
Tewatia and Left arm pacers is the love story of the season.,3
"It connected so well , even he looked up rather than where he intended to hit it",2
"I don't understand Lord Tewatia, he struggles against spinners and slams fast bowlers like they are spinners.",7
Lord Tewatia is here. This might not be pretty.,4
RR just about there to declare,3
Tewatia unironically converting to a great finisher,1
"Laft arm pace and tewatia tonking them, name a better duo",2
Tewatia is no fluke,2
"Go on Tewatia, do your work.",2
That shot was Stokes like,6
This is terrible bowling for the last few overs from RCB.,6
Tewatia makes it look SO easy,3
"Come on siraj 

We know it take off ur mask now",3
Swannie's having an orgasm.,3
Wtf Virat,2
Tewatia might be my favourite meme to come from this IPL,7
"Harsha ""he's got hold of that alright"" Bhogle",11
That did look like a hockey shot,3
"Jokes apart, when tewatia connects the timing is so sweet.. so effortless",10
"When Lord hits, it stays hit",8
Wow this batting order looks good now,3
Tewatia been the best finisher this ipl right?,7

Fuck RCB death bowling man. Who bowls spin on a track like this against smith,7
Lmao strike rate of 232 vs left arm pacers for Tewatia,8
The only benefit udana offers is batdeep,2
Koach using death stare to stop the ball,12
Udana over Morris? Really?! What's the point of Morris bowling the last over if the damage has already been done thr previous over?,9
Lord Tewatia is the second coming of Jesus or perhaps Yuvraj,3
that sound of the bat. woosh,1
tewatia mahn -,2
"Eoin Morgan: Bowls Adil Rashid in the 20th over in a series deciding match and the bowler gets hit hard

Kohli: Does the same with chahal 

I am def not saying kohli and Morgan are equal in their capitancy, all I am saying is that all captains make stupid mistakes and hindsight is 2020",11
That hurt,5
Unpopular opinion: Kohli is not a good captain. He does well as a captain for India because he has good players in a team and culture that is mostly been set up by Dhoni.,7
Lmao can anyone explain how are we going to chase this?,8
DEUS VULT,1
"who wears those blue shoes with red pants, Kanye was right Puma is ugly",4
"Oh no The LORD is down , we're all in big trouble",2
Two spinners meme'd into batting legends. What a partnership.,5
"Tewatia has a very awkward style of batting, it's working so can't complain much.",3
Mane and Rajasthan scoring makes me sad :(,-1
Would have loved to see Tewatia dispatching Starc out into the orbit.,1
"The only game today is dinda's academy new vs old talent , udana vs unadkat",2
Lord being down to earth,5
one more six lord,0
They need to score another 20 runs. it put more pressure on RCB,4
The more I learn... Kohli's hamstring strength flexed in that boundary stop. Wouldn't have guessed myself.,6
"Tewatia being hit by RCB pacer

*""MY TIME MACHINE WORKS!""*",5
That sort of tangled sweep would have torn all the muscles on my thighs,1
classic lord shit,9
What a beauty was that,3

Specialist fielder coming into play,2
Tewatia fuckin brilliant doing it again & again,6
Take out Udana ffs,2
Udana ffw,2
"Udana's gone for 43 in 3 overs

Siraj died for this",11
I guesd its always going to be lord tewatia now,1
"Tewatia is a good cricketer. He can bat, bowl, he fields well too. It speaks highly of domestic cricket too that he is a proper player.",8
Tell me again why Udana is a better option than Steyn?,5
Damn...I'm just worried my boi Iyer is not going to play and DC will get their asses gaped by daddies.,7
Saini should have bowled these overs and not udana,3
"Cheeky shot, he's been trying for that for few times. It worked. Now hit 16 in last over",3
specialist fielder gurkeerat,5
Is this the same pitch as RCB-KKR one or RCB-KXIP one?,6
Okay atleast Liverpool got a goal early on,3
Tewatia in the form of his life.,2
Lord Tewatia 1 Isuru Udana 0,6
Udana saw Unadkat in the opposing dugout and thought - I can't have you steal my thunder.,5
Momentum pretty much shifted back to RR,3
LORD TEWATIA,5
"He literally hits one part of the ground, put a fucking fielder there",9
[removed],3
I didn't know Andrew Tye was in this IPL until I just saw him on my monitor.,2
"Don't bowl left arm bowlers to tewatia. Udana should have been bowled out, not saini.",3
Is this the same ground where Maxwell open bowling for kxip and only conceded 20 runs in 4 overs ?,3
Yeah bowl sundar now koach,0
"This is not Dubai shit.

This is Lord shit. Rappers and Ambanis would never get it",2
"RCB: we want to bowl well at the death this time 

Tewatia: haha ramp go brrrr",5
No matter who wins the IPL but Tewatia is my MVP this season. He has provided maximum entertainment and I am pretty sure earned RR some more fans as well.,7
Two legends started as a leggi and now are the best batsman of their country,25
Smudge playing all the wide balls,5
Smith stop playing wides 😑,6
how many more matches should rcb win to make it to playoffs?,8
Why is TWATtia not in all time ICC 11 team,4
Lord Morris will u save us,9
That was a wide Smitthy boi,1
Udana feels like a waste of an overseas slot,4
"How is tewatia the most reliable batsmen in the lineup consisting of best test batsmen, 2 batters from wc winning team and the man who dances down the track to smash bowlers!?",13
What a catch son!,6
34 off the last 2 overs,1
the new guy?,8
"Holy, what a catch",6
That's some Trent Boult level shit,12
Tewatia is comfortably the player of the tournament so far.,6
WHAT A GOOD CATCH BRUHHHH,7
Shabash Ahmed!!!!,7
WHAT A CATCH!!!,7
Nice catch,5
Noice...,3
What a catch!!!!!!,9
Why don't they go for suprise delivery rather than according to field if the batsman are reading the field,3
"10 points for the catch
-10 for the celebration",9
Brilliant catch that,14
Morris my man!,7
BRUHH,6
"No one

What a catch,7
That is one of the smoothly taken catch in the deep.Excellent work kid,13
Get to 180 please :(,5
Top catch 👏👏,5
that’s a damn good match,4
That's some damn fine catch.,6
Soooo.... Does Smith get an apology thread now? Y'all been shitting on him for quite a while now...,15
Great catch by dungeon master,12
What an fucking catch,10
Are you not entertained celebration will never stop amusing me.,18
Spectacular catch ngl.,9
Switching butler's and stokes position should be ideal for RR,7
Reckon steyn won't do worse than udana,7
"What a great catch by shahbaz.

I look forward to him getting dropped next match.",17
"In 10 years of ipl auction, Morris has been the best buy for RCB in the auction for 10 crores.",17
"**19.2** Morris to Smith, OUT, **taken at sweeper cover by Shahbaz.** **173-5**

SPD Smith c Shahbaz Ahmed b Morris 57 (36b 6x4 1x6) SR: 158.33",2
Archer to finish off with consecutive 6s,1
shit is Kohli now the worst catcher in the RCB side,14
I thought that was six,12
Damn son,5
"Indian ben stokes
.showing his fielding D",8
Archer I hope we have some sixes on the menu,6
Lord back on strike,2
Lmao the commentators are just roasting the umpires this season.,9
"This why you bowl Morris in the 19th over. The goal should be to get wickets, not contain runs. If you get wickets, you will inevitably contain runs.",4
False god Smith exposed in front of the Lord,6
Morris bowled 2 wides and got away with it,-3
Poor Parag,6
Morris has been an absolute beauty for RCB,8
"That catch reminded me of Spiderman 2 metro bridge scene, almost off the bridge!!",1
Calling it: this catch is gonna be played on repeat 5 times in every innings till tomorrow,14
Udana taking udaan scheme way too seriously,5
Binga in the dugout : I think 3rd Ump is worried about his shadow touching the rope. LOL.,30
"1 run, I want 12 more. ~~6~~,6 ,6?",-1
They intercepted 2 wides this over,1
"The 2 most reliable rr players, I feel assured now",3
Kohli literally said how good a fielder he was during toss,12
What an over from Morris tho,4
Morris 3 for again. 😯,2
Morris is on another level this season.,7
Launched the air around the ball into orbit,2
"Morris you sexy man, just make me your slave already!",9
I am not saying it due to the fact the udana isn't performing well. But.. even steyn at his bad form will be a better choice than udana and I said it from the beggining,8
"Morris, what a death bowler!",4
Awesome death bowling by morris !jj,4
Close your eyes and swing as hard as possible. ~ jofra 2020.,14
"I wonder which of the international players would still play if their paychecks were drastically reduced- say $20k to play in the IPL. AB is back home quicker than you can say ""workload"".",8
Morris is probably the MVP of  RCB so far.,9
Morris has justified his 10 crores,23
Damn i love morris,3
I feel RCB is missing Kane Richardson because not Udana or Siraj can be better than him...,4
"If I'm not wrong, this wide was similar to the one in the csk match",7
"Wide, bowl in the slot Morris. We want to see Archer hit a six",7
is morris getting reverse swing?,6
How come RCB has not affected Chris Morris yet?,13
So overconfidence of RCB is gone. That's it guys RCB gonna win only those 5 matches thia season.,4
Tewatia should had take the last ball,2
Goddamn it Archer stop attacking blindly lol,3
"Morris Boult Rabada Nortje we could have played this with our Indian Batters, Imagine.....",3
Morris gun bowler,2
I want Smiling Koach back!!,6
"Morris and Saini need to be bowling in the death, cmon Koach",8
"Bruh the knee jerk in this sub.... Steyn was dropped for Udana, and rightly so. This is the first match Udana has underperformed. Steyn bowled absolute dross whenever he played.",17
Thank god we didn't get cummins for 14 crores.,26
What an over by the god.,7
I am just sad Lord didn't get hold of any in this over,3

Team player tewatia,3
Damn.bro,3
"If Morris continues his form, SA would be almost impossible to score against in the wt20. Imagine AB comes back and suddenly they are a very exciting team after some middling years.",10
Why review?,5
"This has been making me miss Morris in DC, even though we haven't been doing too bad without him.",6
He reviewed it lol,6
Jof reviewed as if it'll do anything but protect his average lmao,10
Riyan Parag specialist number 8,5
Morris with such a gem of an over.,5
Did they just review off the last ball,2
"RR probably wanted 15+ runs from the last over, Morris is like “NO!” and gave away only 4 runs, picked up two wickets too.",12
Sensational over from morris.,9
Nobody is even waiting for the review lol,5
That was cracker of a delivery,6
Reverse Swing??,3
"Fuck, that must hurt bad.",3
"Sans Morris, RR would have scored 195+.",12
Smith at middle order was the stability we needed,7
Holy shit what an over,14
I would fap to that ball,5
Morris is a fucking murderer,4
Watto level review,5
Real 50–50 there. Unlikely to be given out imo 😂,5
Definitely above par on this pitch.,5
"Good comeback in the last over. Morris is a gem. Thats OUT

Almost all teams have good pace strike bowler. Wish we had Mitch Marsh with us.",9
"It's still a good total. RR,don't fuck up pls",5
4fer for morris yay,10
Plumb,6
Morris carrying RCB soooo hard lol,14
lol might as well ask for the review,4
Archers so shithouse. Love the man,4
the good news is we'll stay at 3rd for a while even if we lose this,3
"LMAO, Archer using the review just for the sake of it",10
Morris is fire man.,10
"ball tracking for this, lol",7
Might be the most pointless DRS review in history,12
IMO you can't set fields to stop Smith the way he batted. Well played RR! 👏,7
They didn't cross 180? How?,1
Jofra trolling the umpires,9
what was that review?,3
"This is why wicket taking is very important. Any time, anywhere.",3
That's the plumbest of plumbs I have ever seen.,7
"Good score, TBH.",2
morris you beautiful man,7
"Umm this is hindsight and all but Riyan Parag is a specialist batsman, surely could have done better than 2 runs in 3.",1
Archer: I’m confident I hit it,3
Umpires just want their job to be secure,1
The run doesn't count anyway right? Then why the review?,3
Excellent last over from Morris but this is still a very competitive score.,7
"Dumbest Review, did Archer want to get back at Tewetia for wasting a review in the first game

no reviews left for Tewetia",-1
Morris has expensive tastes. He's looking for a 20 crore contract next season.,13
[removed],6
What kind of death bowling was that from Morris?! Insane,16
God level death bowling,10
Toe crushing delivery,9
That's a Man of the Match worthy performance by Morris. What a sharp last over!,13
I’d like to see Mitch Mcclenaghan replacing Udana.,-1
Lord didn't get strike last over,2
"That rule really does need to change though

If it's deemed not out on review, the bowling team gets away with a dot when it could've been runs. Maybe umpires should delay their decision until the ball is dead? Not sure how else you could change that rule to make it fair",8
"**19.6** Morris to Archer, OUT, **appeal for lbw is given out and Jofra reviews right away.** Full dipping ball at middle stump, rapped him right in front as he looked to go across that. Inside edge? No, says Ultra Edge. That's smashing leg stump, he was struck right on the toe. That'll remain out and Morris has a fourth **177-6**

JC Archer lbw b Morris 2 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66",5
"Rr batsman way oversold morris here, he should've been smacked in pp",-7
Parag be like 'me aasam se yeh karne aaya tha?',4
Jofra salty that another bowler challenging his lead on wickets,9
4-26 !! Morris is extraordinary this IPL.,9
Finch against archer ? Yeah rcb is already 0/1,3
488.5 pts after 1st inning in D11,0
Archer just wanted the 3rd ump not to take his innings break,4
Tim paine and kohli will be proud of this review.,10
[deleted],10
Morris. Pure fire 🔥🔥🔥,5
Might as well say this match is finished and play for nrr. My gut feeling tells me we're losing by 100 runs today,3
"Everyone was nice actually, except Udana lmao",2
[deleted],1
Not a bad total,1
Great last over but 177 is not gonna be easy to chase down. Imagine what this could have been if Buttler and Stokes were swapped and used in their best positions.,2
Morris has been a great edition to RCB. Still not sold on Udana though,13
How has Morris not played more T20s for SA?,9
We dont chase these usually,4
What an over!,2
Lmao those RCB simps pretending to look cool trying to push each other over the balcony,4
"Guys I don't know about you, but that guy from the sensodyne as looks exactly like Shreyas Gopal, like bruh they are soo similar",3
"Uthappa played better than stokes and buttler.

Is this the LORD effect ?",4
"If rcb win this, morris deserves to be motm imo.",11
Please stop playing Buttler as a finisher in T20s,2
At least 15 runs short.  RCB should win it with an over to spare.,-2
Superb last over,7
Is 177 a good score?,2
"Honestly not a bad death overs from RCB consider the hitting power that RR have, and how many wickets they had left. But it could have been so much better if Chahal had been bowled out, and Saini had one left to bowl in the 18th. Maybe 5-10 runs less?",7
Morris has 9 wickets at an avg of 9.33 with an economy of 5.25 from 4 matches so far.,14
Pleasing to see an RCB bowler other than Chahal picking up a 4-fer!,9
"Seeing Morris , things look good for Archer, but seeing Udana, I fear for Unadkat ( he was good in Dubai last match though!!)",6
"RCB gave only 58 off last 5, compared to their usual 80",15
Guys who's the leggie in RR that will push ABD to No.11??,6
"I think Archer used that review cause the ball didnt even hit his foot lol. Thats the only thing they should have actually checked,  not ball tracking. This is a review used right imho. Like for an actual mistake by the umpire and not just for tactical reasons.",-1
"Respect the review from archer there, gotta preserve the average",9
Morris you beauty. !,4
"Such a good death over from Morris, only 4 runs and 2 wickets",11
[removed],7
Archer is eating Finch's wicket today. No any chance.,14
"Exceptional rescue job from Smithy post the Sanju brainfade. RR slightly ahead, should be an interesting chase.",8
It's RRs game to lose now.,8
I am confused if this was bad bowling or is the pitch better to bat on? Batsmen had no problem playing their strokes and middling the ball.,3
"Uthappa as opener, Smith as middle order batman. Buttler should open up instead of stokes.",10
Udana might be in danger of his spot if he keeps bowling like that. It was a horrid day for a lot of bowlers but those short ball dollies gave Smith his form back.,11
Don't forget this is the highest score on this ground this season,1
Happy to see Uthappa smiling. Go uthappa! Screw other teams as well!,7
What's with South African pacers this IPL xD,8
Udana is too predictable man. He needs to mix up the deliveries. Bowl some fucking bouncers or bowl good length balls instead of bowling slow Yorkers every ball. Lol.,4
"Ok so just woke up (yes it's 12:45 in the afternoon here, but it's a ~~Friday~~ Saturday leave me alone) but wtf is that batting order from RR?

Robbie moved to open, good move, but swapping Buttler to move down the order and not Stokes? Seems a bit backwards to me",7
Umpires shouldn't give the LBW decision until the entire play is completed. Wait for the ball to die before raising the finger.,0
"Robbie seems like such a nice bloke, also could be one of those genuinely good commentators later on",14
This score is tricky to chase unless the Chase master stands tall,4
Does it seem like a good surface to bat on? Does RCB have a chance?,3
"Buttler needs to open for RR, he's literally the best when on song. Just let Stokes play as a finisher.",7
" lord remains not out, can't make him out",5
[deleted],9
Add Uthhappa to the list of wholesome players as well ☺️,13
"Uthappa is such a wholesome man, great for him to get a good innings in today",17
Who wins,3
Uthappa is going to replace Harsha in a few years,9
We should just bring in Rajat Bhatia for Udana. Spams slower balls. Handy bat. Frees an overseas slot.,1
Stokes is bade naam chote darshan this season. Rather have tom curran or miller in the team,5
About 5-10 below par IMO,-2
We absolutely suck at chasing decent totals. So I really don't have much hope this game. But Kolhi needs to step up today after that string of trainwreck decisions he made as captain the previous game against Punjab.,5
If Kohli doesn't score runs tonight then RCB will not win.,5
Score is about 15 runs above par,6
That's a bit above par here. Rajasthan has the bowling to restrict RCB. They can't knock it around like they did last time.,2
CSK defended 168 here. Tough to chase in Dubai. Advantage with RR here.,3
Archer and Gopal main threat. 8 overs 0 runs 2 wickets of ab and kohli. This is the mindset I’m going into the chase. Keeping my expectations low.,6
"Uthappa back in form(sound of ball on his bat man!!)

Captain back in form ( proper Smith shots today)

Tewatia..well dude is good( hits 80+m with flick of his wrists, needs to better his timing and he will continue to be good)

Morris WOW, Chahal is like a  wicket magnet but well Smudge is smudge",8
So nobody's gonna talk about morris?,10
Flair up mofos,4
"Morris is doing what no bowler could ever do in the history of RCB, and he is doing it consistently. He'll be their most crucial player if RCB go deep in the playoffs.",14
Chahal in the death is a bad idea.,13
"Swap Buttler and Stokes batting positions, and RR can maximize the PP as well as the death overs.",7
Karnataka players always play well against RCB. Uthappa showed that today,10
Tbh the only gap RCB have in batting rn is Finch not giving expected returns. Otherwise it's pretty much sorted,7
RR makes some sketchy decisions. Why send Stokes as an opener when you have a regular opener itching to go?,3
Trap music is the worst choice this Cricket live thing they do after the innings,0
We depend on Koach today,4
Who can bat with higher strike rate as a finisher? Stokes or Buttler? Can understand why Stokes opened. It didn't come off for Buttler today.,1
I didn’t expect Morris to be this good season. I mean he was great in DD but so so over the past 2 years or so,8
"Chris Morris deserved 15.5 crores instead of Pat Cummins. RCB are lucky, that they lost out Cummins' bid to KKR, and got Morris instead.",8
I see Finch finding his form today,2
"Uthappa Buttler Samson Smith Stokes Tewatia 

It's not that hard, RR.",9
Imagine kohli sending abd again at 6,3
People are really suggesting dropping stokes lmao wtf he's just arrived and scored a 40 the other game smh. One of the very few match winners in the game jeez.,6
Either we'll win comfortably or the match will be over before first 10 overs,2
"Robbie

Samson

Buttler

Smith

Stokes

(Tewatia/Parag/Archer at 6,7,8 as needed)

Edit: Buttler and Stokes swapped could be better, not sure",2
Finch play that one match winning knock for us please,3
"Just for the memes, RR should try opening with Tewatia next match!",5
"South Africa's bowling attack with Rabada, Nokia, Morris and Tahir is going to be fucking lethal in the upcoming T20 WC.",7
"If ABD gets intimidated by Lord Tewatia leggies, I wouldn't be surprised at all",4
Hallabol bitches,6
What braindead move are you expecting during RCB batting?,2
"I think RR has found their ideal playing XI, swap Buttler and Stokes in the order, and then bingo",7
I feel dirty rooting for rcb.,3
It was a good batting performance by our standards and in general but what scares me is that what I saw today was a desperate attempt by the RR management to have a left-right combo. So this unfortunately might not be the end of Stokesy opening.,2
Calling it right now Finch out on 1st ball of Archer just like Shaw,2
we are practically starting with 0/1 with Finch as our opener and Archer bowling start of the over.,0
"Jofra has really injected a lot of fire into RR's bowling. Without him, they would probably be the worst bowling lineup in the tournament. Playing his enforcer role to perfection.",4
Finch pls do something this time.,6
How is Rr looking rn?,1
"That Morris over including that phenomenal catch off Smith may be the game changer. If Smith hadn't been caught, the total could've been 10 runs higher, which could make all the difference. Given that Bangalore have a super deep batting lineup it's still their game especially since our bowlers barring Archer are generally crap. The utilisation of spinners is key. I reckon that we should only give Unadkat one or two overs at the beginning to try and get a new ball wicket or two, but otherwise to utilise our spin options in Tewatia, Gopal and even Parag. Tyagi and Archer can bowl decently at the death",3
"Udana may not be the best bowler out there, but he has bowled his heart out for RCB before this. Yes, he shat the bed today, but he is the best we can play. And yes, he is better than Dale Steyn, who was bowling 120 kph short and wide in his last match",8
I didn't like robbie opening .Good knock today but that makes sure a t20 batting god gets to face much lesser deliveries from here on. Always believed your best batsmen should face as many deliveries as they can and opening with buttler and stokes was the way forward.,-4
Imagine if Koach opens,5
Koach is going to lock AB in the toilet today so that even Saini and Chahal can bat before him.,9
"With 3 leggies, Gopal, Lord Tewatia and Smudge, I don’t expect RCB management to send ABD to bat today.",5
Kings XI fan rooting for RCB cause I think we can go on a little run here :),2
"If jofra can shrug off padikkal and finch quickly , it would be interesting to watch",1
"RR batting lineup next match:

Uthappa, Samson, Archer, Stokes, Unadkat, Smith, Tewatia, Parag, Buttler, Gopal, Tyagi",5
Buttler is a leggie isnt he,2
"**Best Bowling Figures for Morris in IPL**

4/23 vs KKR (2015)

**4/26 vs RR (Today)**

4/26 vs SRH (2017)",6
"Uthappa should open from here on for RR.

Stokes needs to go back to his traditional position of 6/7. Don't understand why he wants to open.

Anyway, let's watch RCB...",4
Did KKR bid for Chris Morris in the IPL Auctions? Any idea?,3
Are RRs sponsor niine? something women use or something I use to clean my face while I’m eating?,4

Buttler not keeping? Rather have uthappa keep so less mistakes in fielding.,7
"Remember Bois.      
Everything is temporary, ESCN is permanent",10
It would be a miracle if Finch survives Archer,3
Mann today is ur day to shine as i already see a collapse coming,5
"He might send gurkeerat before him or ab, but other than that he shouldn't mess with the batting order",2
We're gonna get fucked aren't we,3
"Captain of Australia, for the love of God dont get bowled by a spinner again",4
Who should RCB pick in the 11 by dropping Finch?,1
Samson with the gloves and jos not opening. Both changes that seem to happen for no reason?,5
"Rr has 2 leggies, abd at 11 confirmed",25
Nice to see Samson keeping!,2
They used to show 30+ statistic before. Why 50+ now,7
C H O L L A P S E   INCOMING,1
Nothing against RCB per se ...but hope they go to the bottom of the table  this IPL so that  BCCI gets a good excuse to drop Kohli as the T20/ODI captain ...then finally Team India can have a shot at winning ICC titles with Captain Brohit rather than winning  meaningless bilateral ODI series.,-11
Open with Morris you cowards,8
Padikkal has been clean bowled 3 times. Gand fat rahi hogi bechare ki abhi,0
Finchy... please do something other than walk towards the bowler,6
"Padikkal: ""Wanna face Archer?!""

Just woke up and harsha's speaking french wtf,8
Finchy gonna be shit as usual ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,5
"Off topic but anyone annoyed how some stats people bring up random unrelated/slightly relevant stats as if they mean jack?

Like ""Team A has won 100% of the matches when player B has scored x runs with Mercury in retrograde and me catching my wife cheating on me""",14
Phwoar. You don't play them,5
Finch already on survival watch right now...,4
Good start to a 170+ chase.,2
Finch is a walking wicket here.,3
Bowl Smudge you cowards,2
archer's chains! does he always wear them?,4
RR desperately need Gopal to come back in form if they want to win this. 2nd biggest disappointment among Karnataka leg-spinners this season. (wink),2
Can someone meme Finch back to form please?,7
Kl Rahul is currently the dream11 gamechanger of the season because he changes the game in favor of the other team,16
Archer's hair looks rad,9
More than Finch it's DDP who's sus. When the target is big he gets out quickly. Needs to learn the art of soaking in scoreboard pressure.,-3
Do you guys think Archer can increase his pace if he doesn’t wear those chains ?,2
"Jofra is, for want of a better term, a fucking God",7
hahaha finch you suck you cant buy a run right now,-2
Target would have been 190+ today had Siraj been playing.,8
"Poor finchy, like kallis, he always gets a jaffa",5

"Finch bad finch bad finch bad finch bad

Pls work",17
"""Powering back for the second""

Finch was just jogging back",7
Imagine a combined team with srhs openers and rcbs 3 and 4,5
woah I only just realised Buttler isn’t behind the stumps,1
Looking forward to Finch's 21(22).,4
Oh no its a karnataka player against rcb,2
Archer can't bowl 155+ because the chains are weighing him down,8
Honest question how can Archer have more MVP points than Rabada? Do they factor in which batsmen's wickets they took etc?,4
"RSA pacers Rabada, Nortje, Morriss coming good this IPL. Ngidi might be feeling left out.


Phehlukwayo, Mulder, Pretorius would have been perfect for IPL teams.


Hoping Thando Ntini comes good in future",3
Unadkat taking running practice.,2

 Finch scoring 172 in a T20 match is beyond my comprehension,13
Where is butler,6
Walking wicket.,1
Are all DK Dream 11 ads in Tamil?,0
Buttler not opening and now not keeping? Interesting...,3
I don't understand how Finch is a white ball captain. There has to be better options even if you don't want Smith and Warner as captains.,1
Keep Finch away from Archer...,2

Picked the bones out of that one.,2

"bsdk paddikal you're 20, kohli is 31, you're running like you're the senior",10
Today only I got to know that foreign players has to pay some amount of money from their IPL remuneration to their country boards. Leeches!!,2
Finch played poorly but Udana deserves to get replaced more next game I think. Bring in Ali or Steyn,1
"Ngl, the halla bol chants are hella annoying",6
"On Harsha Bhogle's earlier point: There are lots of French Afrikaners because of the [Huguenot migration to South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots_in_South_Africa) in the late 1600s. Eventually they got adopted into the Afrikaner fold after the Dutch East India company instituted that every school must teach Dutch.  

Some South African names with French Huguenot ancestry could include:  

- Cronier (Cronje)  
- Labusçagne (Labuschagne) 
- de Villiers 
- du Plessis  
- Nourtier (Nortje)  
- Mallan (Malan)  
- Rosseau (Rossouw)  
- du Miny (Duminy)  
- Villion (Viljoen)     
- Blignault (Blignaut)  
- Olivier  
- Fourtuin",7
What a massive disappointment Finch has been in this IPL!,3
"Bowl Jos Smithy, you know it makes sense",5
"People need to stop with the finch drop pepepepoopoo, stick with him, he will produce a Watson esque innings who knows",11
When will ABD come in today,6
I want to see aggressive tewatia vs aggressive kohli.,5
"i have only ever seen games played here in front of empty stadia, do they host games with crowds?",1
One pinga ponga free flow show from finch.. is that too much to ask for :'(,2
"Initially i was joking.

Now I do feel,

1. Kohli
2. Padikkal
3. De Villiers
4. Dube
5. Finch / Moeen
6. Morris

Should be RCB's batting order.",7
Feels like ages since the last Kohli Cover Drive^(TM).,1
Padikkal has been disappointing me. SORRY,-7
"Idc abt RCB but VK is my fav player, what to do...",-2
"Jaiswal in performance of the season list, what are those stats guy smoking",6
Padikkal struggling big time,4
RR will retain Gopal forever just for his 2 matches against RCB every season,3
Why are they still playing Finch? He has flopped terribly this IPL. Should play Phillipe or Moeen Ali in place of him. Make either of the two open.,2
"Can we just get over Finch & bring back Moeen?

Parthiv anyway performed really well in comparison to Finch
( Last year )",2
I don't see Paul Reifel in this match. Would he be umpiring in the next match? He is our lucky mascot.,3
Tyagi just needs to get his lengths straight tbh,3
Paddikkal seemed like a really good player but recently (in the last couple of games) hes been playing a lot of stupid shots.. I hope he doesn't turn out to be a one season wonder.,8
"For a few years I’ve thought Bumrah and Starc were by some margin the best limited overs fast bowlers in the world. 
Jofra is now clearly in that category",18
Doubt RCB will drop Finch. Given his form the fact that they haven't dropped him yet probably says that they are hoping he'll find his T20I form. Also him being more aggressive will probably raise his chances as today can be written off as bad luck and hope that he'll continue this aggressiveness more responsibly next match,11
"Even if RCB play out both Archer and Gopal, they can make the runs. Unadkat, Stokes, Tyagi. Our bowling is being carried by Archer this year.",10
Placement.,3
[deleted],-3
Tyagi cannot bowl short. It always goes down leg.,1
lazy bum unadkat! pretending to dive instead of running after the ball!,2
Is that chick padikkal's girlfriend?,6
What is unadkat good for?,3
Does anyone know who the lady wearing the white top is? They show her during every RCB game,10
That had Gambhir written all over it,6
Sir Parthiv should be selection next game he is a match winner,3
The intent is strong with RCB.,3
Unadkat has conceded atleast 8+ runs without even bowling.,3
This Indian reservation of 7 players per team is making us watch as much old shitters as young talents.,4
Did Smith just say Ben Stokes?!,4
Very excited for India's future in ODIs with Padikkal and Shubman Gill showing great promise!!,2
Tyagi needs some good mentoring and RR is not good in talent management.. I mean.. you know...,7
"No way Rcb is chasing this with 4 leggies in RR

Gopal

Tewatia

Parag

Smudge",10
RR were 50 for none at 5 overs,1
Moeen might play next match.,1
Changing too much this late will create more problem for RCB.,3
Don’t worry rr got their gun bowler on. Runs will slow down again,3
"Padikkal looks like a star man. Nice batting technique, great height, great fielder. A potential replacement for Shikhar dhawan",7
big over alert?,2
"Idc how quickly ab gets out. But if they won't send him to bat at 4 , I would think RCB IS STUPID",4
I can sense a collapse incoming.,5
Impressive last moment improvisation,1
Padikkal is a direct replacement for Shikhar,4
"I think Kohli tries to copy or imitate Amir Khan, when acting in the commercials.",0
"From KKR's point of view; Rajasthan, Chennai & tomorrow Kolkata (of course!) and Punjab should win; in the weekend double headers.",2
Finch's gone will perform next season when we release him,10
"Purple cap holder Tahir hasn’t had a game yet, RCB continue to persist with Finch instead of giving Moeen a few chances. This is bizarre",2
"If Viral Kilo doesn't attack the meme bowler, how we gonna get them runs?",7
"Idk how

But RCB is Shreyas Gopal bunny",2
Smexy flick,1
Gurkeerat is padded up,6
Batsmen should be fined for playing dot balls against Unadkat,5
Gurkeerat padded up lol,1
Holishit Ab is not going to be next in I guess,1
"ah shit, here we go again. gurkeerat is padded up",4
Feels like rcb will chase this.,1
I just want a wicket to fall to see if they'll send AB in next.,3
Lmao how did Kohli end up 3rd on the Orange cap list?,4
Those wristssss,3
Is that Shahbaz padded up? Don't tell me AB isn't coming 2-down again.,6
Did Unadkat graduate from Dinda academy?,-3
"Omg, why is Gurkeerat padded up? Don't tell me they'll send ABD at 6 again..",17
I think Mann is coming next hehe,4
I don't know why but I really hate Unadcunt's face,6
"RCB can't chase this. One wicket, pressure mounts and inbound collapse.",4
Kohli can tap the ball and take a quick single and it brings me more satisfaction than other batsman hitting 6s,9
"Last chance for Kohli to hit a boundary, before powerplay restrictions are eased.",2
Nehra dealing brutal blows towards unadkat,3
Match ups TM are the new 3d player TM,2
"Umpire to Smith :

Ye *BenStokes BenStokes* kya hai",4
"Bowl yourself Smudge you coward, if you get Kohli everyone in the front row better duck because I would blow a massive load",3
"Chahal went for runs today, what’s to say leggies are successful every time",2
Unadkat should ditch the beard look. Makes his face look small and very memeable,8
Only chase master or freak can save RCB today......like every other day,7
"How does Jofra not have chapped lips, he spends all day licking them??",5
Kohli v leggies time,4
"Nehra's tactics when on commentary are just laughable. 

No surprise he told Kohli to yo Negi to pandya in that MI match.",6
Bring Lord to bowl to dismiss Koach,1
Why is gurkeerat padded up,5
Really good start from RCB.,2
Inb4 Lord Tewatia's 3-20,3
"Left Right has to be some secret product these guys are advertising, subliminal messaging and all tactics are being deployed. Max sus",2
"If chahal wasn't rich, even an average girl wouldn't give a single look to him.

Edit- nothing against him... im just saying from girl's perspective.",-18
Lord Tewatia about to end haaRCB's IPL season,5
Hide your wives the Lord is here,19
Why did Jos make 24 off 25?,8
"yep, rr are fucked. only 1 wicket in the powerplay...",8
No!!! Send AB next,2
If the Facebook ad was accurate then it'd just be middle aged aunties and u kills sharing Republic TV articles that'll ultimately lead to a riot and destroy that flower seller's shop.,1
RCB treating ABD as Russell and protecting him against certain bowlers,8
Seeing kohli run it's a wonder how Rohit and him don't run each other out even more frequently,4
AB would be shit scared of tiwatia,1
This sub would erupt if Tewatia gets both Kohli and AB,25
Inb4 Koach gets Padikkal run out,6
I really want AB to tonk gopal,3
"Baring a few games of Pakistan in the past, this is consistently the worst fielding I have seen in any major tournament.",1
Stupid Padikkal trying to smack the lord,3
Scenes if Lord Tewatia gets king kohli out,3
Rajasthan done with their Sharjah games (3 for each team) and their afternoon games (2/3 for each team),2
Gurkeerat next is a good move. You would want ABD nicely in the latter half of the middle overs,6
"Any way to turn off hotstar chat, it’s giving me a stroke",4
"Me thinks AB won't be batting 6 today

What is the fuss over padikkal at the moment, very average",7
Swann is so biased,4
"Me: Always single  


  
Why is Kohli not able to find me?",13
"To be honest, Padikkal looks like an average player. Too limited in his shots and ability",7
"Hey you! Yeah, you scrolling the comments here - I see you scrolling with those dry ass lips!

Don't you go and try and wet them now, dry lip havin' ass",8
Do Rajasthan have to win every remaining match to qualify if they lose here?,1
Padikkal is consistant but slow,5
"Indian ppl love the word “obviously”. When in doubt, “yeah obviously”",5
"It's middle overs, so time for tuk tuk Kohli",4
Shreyas Gopal is the key today,2
Koach respecting the Lord,3
"Ab should bat on day 2, day 1 is too soon",4
"3 overs of Unadkat left, hoping he can guide us to victory",12
Yaar bc tewatia ke over ye log below 6 kaise jaane de rahe hain,1
Ben stokes where r u,2
"All 3 of Finch, Padikkal and Kohli have a SR under 125 this season, they need to sort this out if they are to chase > 175 targets. Finch can't hit two sixes and still be having a SR of 127 and likewise Paddikal can't be just nudging the ball around if he knows Finch is struggling.",2
point of concern would be how to got 3 economical overs out of unadkat,1
"rcb really slow down in the middle overs, something which they cannot afford today",4
I swear I saw Bryan Cranston in that Ramayan ad.,3
Kohli is out of form still at 3rd place for Orange Cap.,7
Bowl buttler you coward. He is not keeping for a reason,5
Gopal has 2 more overs left. We ded.,3
"Hoping for a Kohli masterclass chase today, it has been a while",2
Looks like RR picked bowlers based on who gets VK out the most,3
Commentators waiting for this match to get over to suck on Dhoni to justify their paycheck,6
"To the wise people of r/Cricket:
Why doesn't the top run scorer get an orange helmet to go with the orange cap ?",3
"> Kirayedaar bhi toh gharwale hote hain

*Laughs in Whitefield landlords*",1
man I hate that OOOHHH sound effect,3
Tewatiya has been very impressive. Perfect for his role.,2
Padikkal making Unadkat look like Akram there lol,4
Might as well play without a helmet against Unadkat's pace.,3
"Aight, Imma say this. Padikkal is overrated.",-7
Koach doesn't dance down the wickets for spinners but always comes against Unadkat. How T20 has changed things about approach,3
I'd like to see RCB going along well and almost chasing this down and then Tewatia comes on to bowl again and takes a hattrick to save the day.,9
Unadkat has the same demeanor as Ben Cutting when they bowl,2
"Sucking Kohli now

Sucking dhoni later

Tough day to be a commentator",9
Setting up nicely for death overs 45-50,2
"RR fans, don't forget you have four guaranteed wicket maidens in the back until Smudge starts bowling - RCB are really 51/5 after 11 overs",2
"Is it me or is Kohli not like Kohli this year. Even though he is scoring runs, the fluency and dominance don’t seem to be there. His strike rate is also slow every game. You don’t see boundaries much either.",2
Worst run rate in 7-15 because of Kohli's dismal strike rate and hogging the strike.,6
Even the dugout is shitting on RCB,3
Tewatia priced at 30 lakhs. Unadkat at 3 crores. this season.,7
RCB middle over slowfest has started,2
Padikkal SR is a bit of a problem,4
Wtf,0
RCB has worst runrate even below CSK in overs 7-15,1
[removed],0
Virat *'I'll expect my teammates to take on risk'* Kohli.,3
Parthiv is not even in the list of options,2
RCB making a grave mistake by not targeting Unadkat.,1
Seeing a lot of padikkal hate in this thread for some reason,8
Absolutely criminal to waste an Unadkat over with singles.,6
"Remove their best knocks of 120 and 90, KL Rahul and Kohli have shit strike rates this IPL.",1
None. Open with Parthiv. Moeen in the middle order.,2
These too are so slow batting together. Wtf.,2
"Moeen as an opener is a shit idea. He sucks there. And he will be facing express pace, something which he is seriously garbage against. Play Philippe. Keeps as well.",4
STUPID BATTING,4
Last 4 matches RCB has been batting as if its a ODI match. Literally only singles & doubles,2
Padikkal hasn't been as aggressive as his first 4 games.,3
Kohli really needs to be striking at 150+ in these middle overs... RCB really slow down and wait for AbD to play a blinder.,7
What a strange shot,2
Stupid fielding,2
Padikkal is the new Gill,1
Which IPL team would be the best ODI side,2
"Run rate is an issue. Pressure mounts, collapse incoming.",3
"Run for your life, run for your money Padikkal",1
Unadkat bowling well today. Surprised Pikachu face.,1
Virat nearly got run out,1
how are they making Unadkat seem decent 🤡,3
Just 8 runs in the last 2 overs.,1
Virat Slowli and Dotdutt paddikal!,15
Thala Kohli,4
Tewatia is the 15 cr allrounder KKR deserved,1
The snoozefest has started,1
Nice slow balls by Unadkat,0
Feel like this match is gonna be a thriller,1
What a shit of a thread,1
We're respecting Unadcunt we deserve to lose,1
Wicket or big over incoming this over.,1
"Should bowl out Unadkat in 7-15 overs phase, this 2 not gonna attack him",2
Unadkat having an Economy rate of 6 is peak RCB.,5
What a boring batting. Feels like theyre chasing 150,1
4 runs off an Unadkat over wt actual f,3
Someone like Unadkat is more effective when players are going after him. With his slower balls and variations.,1
Good over from Unad-cutter,1
Kohli and Padikkal laying eggs on the batting crease. Nice for RR,5
Lord,1
Which IPL team would be the best Test side?,1
Only truly explosive player on rcb is AB,5
"Although Kohli has scored runs, He failed to time his innings properly in 3 matches out of last 4. We can defend if we keep up the pressure now.",1
Look how Mumbai chased yesterday. What is this shit,1
Kohli at 7- Why,1
"As long as gopal has overs left, ABD shouldn't be sent to bat - RCD strategist!",3
RCB making Unadkat look like Malcolm Marshall,3
"I thought CSK was playing the night match today. Nah, they're chasing now in the evening match.",1
Padikkal hype dies.,2
Tuktuk.exe is now fully operational,3
Damn wtf Tewatia,1
Was that a replay or another ball??,1
Have a feeling Padikkal will do something silly this over,1
RR need to not dismiss Padikkal,3
Looks like pitch has gotten slow,1
Dotdutt Padikkal lmao,3
Tewatia is in my list of top 10 guys I do not want to hang out with,2
Tewatiya is going to get him next 3 balls.,1
Why is Kohli's average so low against left arm seamers? Do they give him PTSD of CT17 final?,4
You cannot chase a 180 total going run a ball in the 8th over.,3
Bruh Padikkal,2
Padikkal playing the same shot again twice and failing lol,2
"""Bhenkichoot tumhari yaar seedhi ball nahi maar paa rahe"" - Nehra, probably.",2
Virat Kohli has so blatantly transformed into Thala in recent times yet we haven't even noticed,3
Flailing is the only word for Padikkal against spin,2
Somebody remind RCB that it's a T20 and not a one day match.,1
"Rr 10.5

Good luck demoting AB now",2
"Ball’s slow and low, RR has to defend this",1
DDP doing what Tewatia did against Bishnoi,1
Tewatia is making Paddikal look like Tewatia vs spin,3
Scenes if Virat plays another ODI innings.,1
Kohli furiously jerking off watching a left hander play leg spin at the other end.,4
Wtf u doin paddy,1
"Samson: Bohot Badiyaa

Now where have I heard that?",1
No ball? Tewatia wyd,2
2 spinners bowling NBs what's this,2
RCB is scoring max 130/140 here,1
Pls kohli hit this,1
Only Finch and AB are capable of chasing 180. Kohli and Paddikal are 155 chasers.,2
Wtf is it with spinners overstepping this match?,2
"3 no balls this game, all by spinners, interesting",4
Spinner bowling a no ball is a crime.,5
Spinners bowling no ball lmao,3
Bwahahahaha,2
Padikkal is just putting pressure on other players. We know Kohli is there to anchor.,4
What is it with this game and spinners bowling no balls,3
Scenes if Kohli defends this,3
WTF,0
did Finch eat Paddikal's lunch,0
Why tf are all the spinners bowling no balls,0
Padikkal useless after powerplay... just like partiv.,2
Anyone else feel like Strike rate is terribly underrated in T20?,5
DDP piling on the pressure but rabid fanbois here will downvote me. 🙄,2
He should be shot for that,0
Hmmm,1
"gaand faad ke line cross kardi, extra effort for the no ball",1
Feel sorry for CSK fans today as they have to endure Thala like batting now and actual Thala next match,6
Lord giving koach an opportunity,2
I have a feeling that Udana is gonna be dropped next match. Leaked too many runs without getting wickets.,2
"If you think it's the vegan diet that's affecting Kohli, you clearly haven't seen Finch's performances.",0
I can never understand how a spinner bowls a noball,2
What's with leggies bowling so many no balls today..,1
Ah man,1
"A spinner bowling a no ball should be fired





out of a cannon",3
"""Can't afford to lose Kohli""

How are we supposed to expect our big players to show some urgency during the middle overs when the cricketing community basically encourages them to play this run a ball nonsense so that they can maybe win 1 game in 6 chasing 12 an over in the last 6 overs.",7
What's with spinners bowling noball today !,2
Juicy full toss and he couldn't take full toll of it wtf,2
Stop putting all the onus on ABBD please,2
Wtf is up with spinners bowling no-balls today,1
Can you get stumped on a free hit?,1
the fucking free hit sirens are jump scares,5
113kph,1
Can you be stumped in a free hit?,3
"Had VK left the full toss, that would have been wide",2
Single on free hit. Wow,2
"Make that 2 no balls in an over TWICE, both by spinners",2
Lord to chad to give boundary off free hit,2
Lord blessing RCB now,5
Wow Kohli is really struggling here to put it away here,5
"lol, I dont remember even one instance where batsmen utilized free hit",5
Fucking shit.,2
If that was Dhoni it would've been a no ball,3
Is Finch the best worst of IPL?,1
must be the lowest runs scored off no balls for a match,2
Lol the free hit sirens scared me🤣,6
Kohli doesn't have dhonis  influence lol,5
Lord level bowling,3
Tf is Messyside derby?,2
Bc how could spinners ball no bowl,3
Day by day umpiring going to new lows,0
"Did Kohli pressure umpire to check the height? Come on, what's going on this IPL?",1
Utthappa innings vs RCB innings. Hangs head in shame.,2
"Come on Kohli, be that guy who smashed SL in Hobart. I know that was an ODI but damn that Strike Rate.",6
This doesn't feel like RCB batting of old,2
Kohli boi this only works for dhoni.,3
"I was using phone and using TV as background noise, the sirens fucking scared the hell out of me",1
Lmao did Kohli really bully the umpire into giving another no ball?,4
Someone needs to talk to Padikkal. He is playing ODI Cricket,9
Cheater kohli forced the umpire/s,4
Lord gifting RCB free runs,6
"Ok as much as I love virat it’s only right I hold him to the same standard of dhoni over that wide . Hopefully he didn’t pressure the umpire

Edit: Nvm I love you kohli",1
Tewatia bowling gully cricket level,6
Spinners bowling noballs and batsmen taking a single wtf lol,7
Lord playing for rcb now?,7
Tewatia wtf?,5
"3 wides, get fucked.",7
"Say whatever you want. The numbers might hide this. But Kohli is miserably out of form. Even though he might be scoring runs, his fluency is of an average batsman right now. I hope he finds his touch before the international matches begin again.",11
wtf!!,3
"3 wides in a row, dafuq",5
Jeez. What's wrong with the Lord,3
"Kohli has lowest strike rate among top 5 run scorers this season. Even lower than >!""strike rates are overrated""!< KL",7
4 extras,3
So tewatia did get a hat-trick of .... wides.,6
3 wides in a row. Lol,5
It's hilarious how English cricketers are diehard supporters of RR but RR captain is Smith and coach is Warne,3
Has tewatia been betting on RCB?,2
"Wtf lol, is this spot fixing?",5
bowling 6 wides to save a boundary lol,2
Tewatia pitying on RCB,4
RCB gonna bottle this season as well looks like,0
Your nominations for the Worst IPL XI 2020?,1
"rcb is losing this.  
When AB comes 4 leg spinners will be around like vulchers.",1
Stop. Bowling. Extras.,0
These too are useless. They'll build up the pressure and when ab comes in and has to score 13 off every over and gets out. This sub will start jizzing about Kohli's plan.,2
Over dismissed,1
Tewatia giving free runs to rcb for being a meme team.,5
Spot fixing /s,2
3 consecutive wides. baby over,4
Deja Vu,1
Umpire getting exercise with the extras here,1
Omg Mao sorry Swanny,2

Lazy and selfish shit from Tewatia.,5
This is the first time I have seen 3 consecutive wides in professional cricket,2
Tewatia is broken boys,2
Bc this smells of fixing tbh 😅,3
Padikkal is slow,0
Te-wide-ia,2
Lord is being generous today,2
Is that a record for consecutive wides?,4
Someone else would be finishing the over If this was gully cricket,4
RCB are trying out the bat deep approach here.,0
"RR be like "" don't worry mate RCB here is free runs""",3
Paddikal was looking to get out,3
Hahahaha 3 wides in a row,1
What a meme over this is lmao,4
Tewetia on d r U g s,3
Lord showing mercy,3
Padikkal looks so out of his element,4
Tewidetia strikes again,3
Now the wides have been a waste.,2
Well built pressure deserved a wicket,3
Tewatia got RCBed playing against RCB,1
Smart drop there,1
"Swann is absolutely hilarious man, best addition to the Dugout this year.",6
"It was all part of Tewatia's God's plan.

The fielder failed him",2
Tactical drop from RR,5
"RR - Score runs BCs.

RCB - No.

RR - We will give you free runs then.",3
Village cricket.,1
Bruh Tewatia should calm tf down,11
Lord tryna finish 2 overs in 1,2
[deleted],13
Tewatia comes off as a VERY unlikeable guy,6
Did swanny just say fuck?,13
Swanny just dropped an F bomb.,7
Lord conditioned Padikkal into playing that shot with those 3 wides down the offside..,4
After all that it was only 9 off that over.,8
Tewatia auditioning for the hundred?,4
"Commentator : RR was 76 at this stage.

Tewatia : say no more fam. 

*3 wides*",11
Te-wide-ia 😂,5
Man Tewatia is kind of a cunt. Seen him yelling at his team mates and at Khaleel now,14
This was 4D chess by tewatia here.,2
"With all those wides and NB 

A good over by Lord",6
Tewatia seems like a shitty person on field.,15
Swann said Fuck,8
Got a 9 run over with 4 extras lol,7
Oh no the Lord is pissed,5
Tewatia is like id have caught that,5
Those wouldn't be wides to Finch,3
LORD always had a plan to bore the batsman into getting out.,2
Bad drop but tewatia can chill out. You aren’t doing anything by yelling at the fielder lmao,6
"Did Swanny just go ""fuuuuuck""? LMFAO!",6
Meme team keeps the meme dream alive.,2
A no ball and 3 wides and still they only managed to get 9 runs,8
I don't see RCB winning this.,2
Not the smartest shot from Padikkal after free runs from all those wides,2
He said the f word didn't he lmao,3
Tewideia,3
"Lol Tewatia has too much aggression for a bloke who is a bits and pieces and player. Easy there, lad.",12
Strike rate 100 each wtf,3
4D chess by Uthappa not taking that catch,2
"Inflate deflate strategy , don't bat in middle overs, hard hitting after that . It's all in the plan bois
/s",2
The lord gifting RCB runs so they could put up a fight,7
Swann and Tewatia both losing their shit lmao,3
16D chess by lord by boring batsman by bowling continuous wides. Too bad Robbie didn't help him there,1
Did Swann say Fuck on air?,13
Was that a strategy to create a chance by the Lord,6
I think we will chase this comfortably by the 34th over.,11
"2 wides, one free hit, one no ball and still only 9 runs wtf",6
TACTICAL DROP,11
nearly got a wicket by bowling so shit and  taking the concentration of the batsmen away,6
Swann said fuck lol,8
Tewatia wouldn't be playing along with Kohli at internationals with that shit attitude,11
Swann just said fuck on dugout. Is this a first?,12
"Drake may may

First pic: 4 of 1 ball.

2nd pic: 3wds and 1 run of 1 ball",6
"""Fuuuuuu 🤬"". Swanny kiss your contract goodbye 👋",24
What a set up by Tewatia. If only Uthappa was alert.,0
Swann is unhateable,6
A 10 ball over and only 9 off it. That's just poor!,5
Tewatia seems like he has anger problems.,13
Don't know what Tewatia is pissed about. That was the best someone like Uthappa could have done.,10
"Lol 9 runs of an over with 3 dots n no boundaries

Prolly first time in ipl",3
Swanny said fuck LOool,9
Wtf Utthappa!,1
Lol Lord trying to recreate Warne's ball of the century after spending time with him in the nets.,13
Virat taking deep TM,2
"3 wides, 2 noballs

Lord works in mysterious ways",12
graeme swann just sweared on live tv. lol,19
I hope RCB lose this one as well! So they finally drop Finch.,5
Did Swann just drop an F-bomb?,13
Dare I say it. Kohli is the problem in the RCB line up. He kills all the momentum,16
Rcb is not even trying anymore,13
utterly horrendous batting so far,8
RR's fielding is absolutely shambolic.,6
Fuuuuck,3
Why does RCB keep playing tuk tuk in middle overs? Same as last game. They don’t attack.,10
Padikkal needs to go now... AbD has to come in anytime now.,0
Swann legit angry af,7
Imagine being david Miller waving a banana around,3
"I might not have said it, but today morning I had uttappa for breakfast, along with green coconut chutney, and curd afterwards😋👍🏽",5
"Twetia will put his base price at least at 1 crore, next auction.  I think he rates himself pretty highly.",7
I had to check if the Stream was stuck on a loop for those three wides lol,25
Rcb dont deserve playoff spot.,16
It's like they have already thrown in the towel.,2
"RCB: *tuk-tuk*  

Lord: Thode wide balls daal deta hu",36
"Watching the replay, that actually was a pretty hard catch. Ya tewatia needs to lay off",10
Tewetia to undergo a breathalyzer in the break,13
Did Swann just said the F-Word in the Dugout Commentary?,6
"*Yeh saala bahut overacting karta hain*

T: Tewatia is way OTT",18
"Tewatia's behavior is so immature, they're still calming him down during the ceat timeout -_-",21
remember hesson was the coach of kxip when they went from playoff spot at halfway stage to 7th/8th in the last 2 seasons,3
Sanjay BANGer is annoying,0
"Trying to get the batsman out hit wicket by laughing so hard at you bowling a ten ball over, 5D chess",3
Swanny fuuuu>>> Rahul-Fuck. R we still on tv?,3
"I dare you to upvote me cunts. 

Pls",-5
Bangar has a horrible accent. Worse than Deep das,0
Swannie is such a drama queen! And definitely my favourite commentator of this IPL season.,4
This is the second time that Padikkal has played a run-a-ball innings for 4+ overs.,7
anyone know what Khaleel said to him in that game against Sunrisers,5
I hope Swann isn't fired,10
Only 9 runs from that over lol. RCB will rue their chances,3
Fear the wrath of the Lord,1
Man Robbie doesn't deserve to be yelled like that. Cunt tewatia,12
If RCB are losing without a fight. I am gonna stop supporting them,4
Fuck off Tewatia it wasn't that easy a catch,15
Swann tearing Robbie a new one,2
Leg spinner is here. ABD coming in at 8 today,1
Oh wow Tewatia losing his lid was kind of a cunt move,12
Stokes is still hobbling,4
Someone different keeps for RR every time,2
Tewatia is pissed af lol. Does he not remember how terribly he batted that one game for the first 19 balls?,13
"Run rate over 10. Leg spinners all over the place. Yes bois, we ded.",7
Tewatia really got a arrogant face.,12
Omg calm the fork down Lord,5
What is this 100 strike rate nonsense.,3
Rcb would be like csk if they didn't have abd,2
"Classic RCB incoming - Padikkal gets out trying to hit a wild shot, Kohli keep on eating dots, Abd gets confused with Kohli's bc batting and hit few boundaries before falling to Lord Gopal, Kohli will eat 10 more deliveries before getting out and reacting as if he would have saved the world if he had stayed.",3
"when is kohli going to turn it up, if he does",1
If kohli thinks he can score 100 runs in last 5 overs someone needs to tell him he's lost his mind,4
Where is INTENT from KOACH?,2
Uthappa was the guy at the other end who told Tewatia to not lose hope and have faith in himself after he was 8(19),13
Did uthappa say chutiya?,4
Gopal transforms into prime Warne against us.,10
I don't care who you are but you cannot shout at your team mates after bowling 3+ extras in an over,16
Channeling our inner CSK here,6
"I hope they keep up the tuk tuk batting

edit: spoke too soon",1
Point to prove ™,1
Lol Kohli 17(18)*,1
Tewatia has to learn from Bumrah how you react to dropped catches,9
Do they think the target is just 77?,5
CSK would be showing more intent than RCB are showing right now. Not sure what the plan is?,4
Lord thinks he’s hot shit,11
I wonder what the record is for a specialist batsman in the playing XI but not getting to bat.,6
Is it just me or does shreyas gopal look like a less ripped dev Gill,3
Tewatia you got be the world's best batsman to be such a dick on the field.,8
TakeDeep^(TM) approach from RCB so far,5
"paddikal 28 (28)

kohli  17(18)   


ODI match this",8
Is Stokes not bowling today?,2
Fuck this need pre 2016 Kohli against spin,4
chewtiya,11
Kohli really using the run up the wicket fakey massive 6 into forward defence,5
Smith should bring himself on,6
[deleted],4
RR should get Hugh Jardon in on a mid-season trade to really strengthen the bowling attack imo,6
"Didn't Swann say ""Fuck"" just couple minutes ago",3
Tewatia is behaving like that gully ka awaara launda who thinks he is the best sportsman in the mohalla .,23
Padikkal with a solid 100 strike rate here.,9
Finally some intent ;-;,3
They need to move on from this catch,3
Oh my god Swann will you stop whining about that catch,5
Keep these two at the crease till 14th and keep ab away. Ezpz,8
Vintage 2012 kohli shot,5
Tewatia reminds me of Krishnappa Gowtham. Another spin bowling finisher who was equally unlikeable. He used to play for RR too I think.,6
Terrible attempt by Uthappam but Tewatia acting like a pure twat tbh. Imagine bowling 3 wides and a no ball as a spinner and having that temper.,18
Tbf you'd imagine RCB to win the game if you need 100 from 10 with Kohli in and Abd + Morrison waiting to come in.,3
"You can't expect AB to come and strike 30 ball 70 every match. There is should be support from others.
This is where the coach should get involved.",7
Tewatia is gonna do a Harbhajan anytime this season.,7
Koach on the move yay!,3
[removed],6
There's something satisfying about Kohli hitting Gopal for a six,10
INTENT,4
are kohli and AB both weak against leg spin?,2
"Aight unpopular opinion on r/cricket...I don’t like tewatia, especially his temperament",18
That was the most desperate yet successful shot attempt I’ve seen in a long time,5
Good going congratulations rcb. You got this,3
Why don't they substitute Uthappa?? He drops a catch every fucking game!,-5
Finally timed it right!,1
Tewatia is going crazy..lol,0
how would hve kohli played against peak shane warne?,-1
"teams do not get the simple concept that hitting sixes wins you games in t20. moar sixes, moar wins. tuk tuk and beautiful cover drives don't",4
why are these guys bowling like gods while our bowlers get taken to the cleaners?,4
Bring back pace. Keep 5 overs of legspin for Abd,0
"If you guys think we are going slow now, wait till Sundar & Shahbaz come in next.",9
Was Rhodes really better than Jaddu at catching? Idk. Maybe at ground fielding he was but catching god tag should go to Jaddu imo,0
"Come on lads just cunt a few massive sixes, boundaries are the meta now and forever",2
Tewatia’s tiny fame already getting to his head.,12
Lusty Blow^TM,2
Swann is about to get a stern talking to or something,2
What did tewatia do? Missed it,2
Wtf is unadkat doing bro,4
Wicket incoming boys,3
"De Kock drops a catch off Bumrah. Bumrah fist bumps him and shapes it up

Uthappa drops a catch off Tewatia. Tewatia acts like Uthappa said something about his mum.",47
Tewatia looks like Lakha from Lagaan.,3
Fuckin Unad is the worst fielder I know,2
Just drop Unadcunt please,0
The match will depend upon how Kartik Tyagi bowls.,1
Tewatia is gonna have a heart attack at this rate,5
Wow fielding has been atrocious,2
Slippery fingers🙄,1
UAE pitched to slow and sticky for good T20,1
Comedy,2
Why the fuck is Unadkat in point,1
Why does Swanny say sanjay BANGer,4
Padikkal needs to go.,2
This is what Kohli's pressure on the fielders does sometimes.,3
"Yeah tewatia hype isn't going to last long, he had a purple patch of a few matches and thinks he has the biggest dick in the squad. Also he has like two proper shots in his arsenal and bowls in the ok to mediocre range, shit is going to catch up to him.",14
Future IPL strategies will evolve in such a way that teams will deliberately not take the wicket of  players like Padikkal.,5
"Alright Padikkal crossed 30

See ya RR",7
Damn that was alpha Af from DP lmao,2
Money Laudering at its finest,3
The fielders do a great job at justifying Tewatia’s emotions.,5
This fielding is next level,8
Padikkal doesn't bother rotating striker either lol,7
RR's shit fielding is worth 15-20 runs every match,7
Now watch Kohli hit 5 2s and a 4 every over until the end of the match while r/Cricket fumes,7
Paddikal is a powerplay player i guess,3
Tewetia is going to abuse a hotel staff,6
Padikkal sucks,2
There are so many tiny holes in this star studded megastar facade of RR. So many little problems.,7
Swann is unironically my favorite commentator,11
Scenes if Tewatia does something stupid and fires up Kohli,9
What's the highest amount you won in fantasy games ?,3
Lmao who did that shit throw?,3
Still chase able. Kohli just gotta go from 2nd to 3rd gear,9
Fielders are pissing off the lord..,5
I think Padikkal needs to go after it now. 32 runs is a lot,12
This is just painfully slow from Padikkal,8
Batting is not that hard as this duo is making it look like,7
Why the fuck is padikkal playing such a dull innings. Fire up or leave!!,9
Koach cementing his place as the Indian captain by batting like the previous Indian Captain.,9
"You know one cricketing cliche I haven’t heard in a long time - “good ball, good shot, good fielding - good cricket all around”",9
Did they take swann off cos of the f word?,7
"The meme syndrome of RCB is so contagious, they infect every team they play against.",12
"Shaw, Samson b Tewatia r the only aggressive indian batsman in this ipl",3
"control, tewatia control (in nana patekar voice)",8
DDP is stat padding. Smh,3
Padikkal clearly stat-padding here...,10
Tewideia?,5
DDP's offside game is weak as fuck,5
The fielding is absolutely piss poor and annoys me more than anything else as a fan. It's bare minimum to be able to field competently,3
Where is stokes??? Not bowling today??,3
"To my fellow RCB supporters, ABD will save us today!",2
"Lol if there was a Fair Play Award for players

I'd definitely see our lord coming in last

3 straight games, 3 arguments with 3 different people.",23
Why people hating Tewatia? 19 runs in 3 overs,3
What is Paddikal waiting for?,1
"Wtf, that wasn't a wide. Kohli had to move out of the way.",8
Kohli has forgotten how to hit boundaries,5
RCB playing like they need 95 of 95,8
So Paddikal has just made two boundaries in the last ten overs...,3
After scoring 30 u don't have to play safe padikkal,7
what has tewatia done now? did i miss something? other than his outburst right after the dropped catch i didn’t really see him do anything...,2
3 fours and 3 sixes in the entire RCB innings.,3
Padikkal trying to replicate Saha’s innings vs KKR,3
RCB should wear whites from next game. Playing test ffs.,4
Rr fielding will cost them this game.,5
Should sneak in an over by Stokes to keep options for the end,5
"dude, Kohli is more expressive than most of the Bollywood stars.",7
Imagine not smashing every one of Twatia's bowls for a boundary.,2
"Cmon Dev, you need to be aggressive",3
Koach is like that PE teacher to Padikkal who makes the kid run a lot :),8
"Only 1 wide this time

Kohli seems disappointed",2
One thing I like about Samson as keeper is that he doesn’t unnecessarily knock the bails off the stumps.,7
CEAT robot ad makes me so uncomfortable,7
Stop writing off DDP. He just needs a few bad balls to get going! Kinda like Smith with Udana,5
"Oh cmon tewatia got angry cause of a drop he felt like should've been taken. They're cricketers hopped up on adrenaline, it's completely understandable, stop turning so easily",8
"DPD has to get a move on here. 
Won't be easy against Jof and Tyagi at the death.",2
Run out incoming,3
with one wicker down rhey are playing pretty slow.,1
Padikkal aiming India test slot,6
Devdutt Shubman Padigill,8
100*(98) partnership coming boys❤️,12
"I do like Kohli’s running, he quick",2
"Kohli is animated on field: OMG KOACH SO PASSIONATE

Tewatia animated: WHAT A KNOBHEAD",7
is Siraj's pants tailored differently,3
Somehow running between Padikal and kohli not clicking..,4
Cut Tewatia some slack. Dude is relatively inexperienced guy who probably got embarrassed by 3 consecutive wide deliveries,5
Devdutt being Dev Manus to RR this time,5
Kohli loves taking on Unadkat’s fielding lmao,5
"Tbf rcb has done well than I expected , they are not yet out of the match by any stretch ..still very much in the game by running hard twos and quick singles",3
"why does rcb always give up right from the start, esp in big chases",3
Ball is following UnAdkat everywhere,3
Padikkal what u doing,4
every ball that Paddikal faces is one less ball for ABD.,4
Wonder weather gurkeerat has been praying for a win or wicket.,2
If Anushka doesn’t have twins Kohli going to be pissed. “There should have been two there”,88
1 boundary in last 5 overs lol,4
"Kohli running two's


Koach's in for a big one now",4
Has everybody forgotten that ab isn't just a finisher? Even the commentators are being retarded.,5
Think Paddikal is not able to keep up with Koach's running.,2
Lmfao Padikkal is throwing his wicket away very soon. Looks exhausted af via the 2s he's run,3
boundary jaaye tel lene bhai tu double double bhaagtey reh bas😍😍,3
One good over off Tyagi and we should be ok,2
Kohli thinks his batting as workout session,4
"Ah yes, the famous cricket chant: we will rock you",4
Why are rr players lumping jesus,1
Is Lord ambidextrous? He bats left but bowls and throws with right.,0
Umm stokes is limping.. hope he's fine.,3
Have a bad feeling koach is gonna get out ...padikkal needs to hit,3
Paddikal needs to start playing for 6's. He's not showing any intent. At least let AB come in.,5
Stokes limping still,3
[deleted],2
Is padikal in contest for no. #4 then why is he batting like rahul.,1
"On Paper, Padikkal should be able free his arms against both these spinners. What is the point of left-right combination here.",3
Why did rcb get bored of the game the second the first wicket fell,5
Lol it looks like koach is punishing paddikal.,5
Padikkal - BC. I can't run. I will hit out & go,3
Google win probability finally started to favor RCB.,3
Padikkal too tired. He gonna get out trying to slog.,2
So is RR gonna get a unfair play award,2
Inb4 RCB sends Sundar ahead of ABD,3
RR fans I got some bad news for y'all that involves Ben stokes,2
"Hey, what happened to Swann?",7
Looks like the extras are gonna save us today,2
4D chess by Koach making Ddp run fast. He'll get runout eventually,7
RR giving too many extras today..,1
"*Paddikal panting*

Kohli: umm, pathetic.",12
Padikal will die out of exhaustion today,7
"He's a decent leggie and a promising young batsman, but Smith doesn't have the stature to keep the Lord's ego in check.",20
Half of RCB’s runs are extras at this point,3
RR would not want to dismiss padikal tbh.,10
Sloppy bowling and fielding from RR. Too many extras,1
Never thought I'd say this but kohli's lack of power hitting is showing this season,9
Who is in dugout with bangar and binga?,2
What is happening to Devadutt Padikkal??,1
Paddikal not able to smash anything when did his last boundary came,3
Lol...,1
"Rather than attacking the leggies, paddikal went a run a ball there.",1
Would Swann be banned? He is bit over the top but entertaining. It would be shame to not have him in the dugout,6
i wonder if paddikal's high SR in SMAT is due to chinnaswamy,2
Why is Stokes still fielding Wtf,9
"Padikkal bringing in runs, in the form of wides that is",3
"Padikkal looks cooked from running, five bucks says he doesn't make it to 40 balls",6
"Stokes looks like he's about to cry, why is he on the field",5
"Ben stokes looking ginger

Also seems to be slightly injured",7
Stokes’ probably got corona,4
"Just drop finch for Phillipe at this point, cant be much worse.",8
Regular Indian Cricket players tuk tuking. Uthappa IPL MVP fight me,4
Why's everyone shitting on tewatia here?,2
KP left IPL Commentry.,3
">Shaam tak singles lenge inki gaand fat jayegi.

-Kohli to Padikkal",22
If stokes is just gonna field and not bowl might as well get a substitute fielder lol don’t want to worsen the injury,4
The intent™ with Kohli runs a sure single is higher than others running a risky double,7
RR is at least one big-ticket bowler short.,3
"Hmm Kohli's ""Ben stokes"" is out. What do you think is gonna happen now",2
Kohli sees Stokes field and remembers to say benchod,3
Yeap padikkal looks beyond done,7
Paddikal putting a lot of pressure on Kohli.,4
Mandatory BC from koach that...,1
rcb are teaching csk how to play for nrr,7
Padikkal needs to go big or go out here. Doesn't make sense otherwise..,9
[deleted],0
Kohli just exhausted the shit out of padikkal with the running,8
Padikkal looking like he just had sadya.,2
Hope Swann is not penalized for that Fuck. I really enjoy his enthusiasm in the dugout.,8
This side on image of tyagi is kind of creeping me out,6
Vincent van Stokes looks worse for weather there.,2
Where are the boundaries viraattt,4
It would be criminal if ABD doesn't walk in if a wicket falls,9
Rcb: boundaries are overrated anyways,7
[deleted],14
Tyagi turning into such a gun death bowler ahhhh,7
"Kohli about to run into Paddikkal and get him to retire hurt, so he can come back if they need him",5
Padikkal is preparing for next auction,5
"Archer's two overs at the death will make the difference, even if RCB starts hitting now",8
Padikkal is killing me here.. ahhh,4
We are like 15 runs short now ugh,6
This is pure shit batting. Bowling isn’t unplayable or anything,6
Paddikal hasn't scored a boundary since powerplay,7
Something tells me that all these extras are gonna bite RR in the ass later on,7
Padikkal is fucking this up,6
Two more tuk tuk overs and RR pretty much wins the game,3
"Finchy has coached Padikkal well, and they should have saved Kohli instead of AB",5
One excellent over of 3 or 4 and pressure will be firmly on Rcb,1
"Stokes out,  Miller in,  If Stokes is not bowling.",1
"36(36) beautiful innings. But after all the next batsman can't play leg spin for shit, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",1
"This feels like 2009-12 Kohli. Great timer, not so good in finding gaps.",2
Padikkal should just go for it if he's struggling so much. Atleast ABD will get some time to bat himself in..,4
The way things are going RCB will have 8 wickets remaining but need 4 of the last ball to win,4
Stokes looks so ginger in the heat that even real ginger will take an offence,6
Koach version of cruel and unusual punishment - running twos constantly in the middle of the desert,10
They’ve taken a wicket alert during every Tewatia over lol,3
"Chill guys, they're giving AB enough rest after making him Keep in the sun",7
86 from 48 is chaseable but u can't expect abd to come in 16th over when rrr is 12+ and expect him not to play some loose short at the start of his innings,8
"Archer vs Ab/Kohli might decide the game

Up for some top quality cricket",3
Brace yourself. 20 ball over is coming,5
"*running between the wickets*

No one:

Koach to  Padikkal: Shabash Kachra Shabash",5
Get Stokes off the field wtf,4
Kohli got 2 or 3 length balls in that Tyagi over and hit every single one to the fielder along the ground,3
"No boundaries, no wickets .... weird",3
Kohli has not had a great Ipl but still he managed to be in Top3.,3
brilliant over from tyagi given the circumstances,2
Parthiv and Moeen for Gurkeerat and Finch would balance RCB quite well,2
Paddikal ffs,2
"need a smacking this over, but knowing paddikal we're going to see more bed shitting",2
"This might be an Unpopular opinion but RCB's just no longer the exciting team that it was. A few years ago, even when they're losing they have that flair and boldness that seperated it from other teams.

Now it's winning a majority of its games but I'm so damn bored when I'm watching their matches (that ABD Sharjah innings being the only slight outlier, even then the match was boring til then)",3
Cmon Padikkal hit it,1
"Stokes is limping, have a sub fielder.",2
Padikkal is again playing for himself,2
Bruh devdutt looks tired asf,3
"Everyone is bashing Kohli but I think he’s been exceptional. Just let him get to 50 and the real fun will begin 6,6,4,4,6,6",2
Is it the pitch or is it the batting?,1
"Tewatia has bowled well except for the wides , knows exactly which area he is targeting",3
"if these guys bat through, they'll end up as 2nd and 3rd in orange cap list",4
Finally,2
Vintage Kohli,2
Onerun Paddikal,1
"Openers like Padikkal end up doing more harm than help in T20. Gill is another one, also Jaiswal",3
Beautiful.,1
Fucking finally,2
Koach made Padikkal run so much that he can't now hit,3
The one and only OG,2
Kohli go! Make the match interesting pls,2
"Fuck Tewatia


Smoke'em boys",3
Fuck. Finally connected.,2
RR would be foolish to get paddikal out..,1
DDP can't time for shit today,1
"Dude padikkal, just hit it in the air.",1
EZ chase for RCB,1
Beauty from the king,2
"Kohli's at least showing intent, Paddikal idk what he's doing",3
INTENT BHENCHOD,1
A 70 run partnership at a SR of 118 is uninspiring. The asking rate at least calls for SR of 184!,2
"Padikkal needs to start swinging that piece of wood in his hands, or let the ball hit the other piece of wood.  


He can't tuktuk his way to victory",2
"I'm going to hear Bhogle saying ""he's got hold of that"" in my dreams at this rate",3
Why are people so pessimistic RRR is still under 11,3
"Tewatia needs to be shown his place, he's cocky as fuck",9
They've been giving a wicket alert for past 3 overs now.,2
Koach's hoeing the Lord his place.,1
How many fucking wides,3
"Everytime RCB hits a Six, the comms go momentum shift and things will go silent for another 3-4 overs",3
Shitty lord,0
Padikkal slow,1
"Pakidall is forcing kohli to hit here. If kohli gets out, rcb is in a lot worse spot than if paddikal gets out trying",3
"Kohli: Fine, I will do it myself",3
Is devdutt playing anchor with kohli at the other end?,4
man i was excited for paddikal this season for his sr more than avg and now im disappointed,6
Finally Kohli releases after edging so long,8
Kohli: Ab bolo intent bhosdi waalon!😂🤣,13
"From commentary rules book:



Kohli on screen:

Commentators: something about fitness, best chaser.

Dhoni on screen:

Best finisher.",11
Wide-tatti-a,3
"Forget Dhoni, Kohli too is too old for t20.",-1
Parikkal not timing at all.,2
Who's the new commentator on Dugout ?,1
lmao gurkeerat isnt gonna bat again isnt he,5
That slo mo of Tewatia looked like a loreal advert,1
Rahul Wide ia,3
"Paddikal needs to hit here.

Edit: Welp",2
leg spin vs left handers see the result btwn tewatia and devdutt,2
Tewatia has bowled some utter rubbish and is lucky he hasn't been punished worse.,2
Padikkal needs a nap,3
Tewatia isn’t a good bat and I don’t rate him as a bowler.,5
Tewatia bowling wides like he is shaun tait.,2
Top class keeping from Samson so far. At least he's way better than Pant in keeping,2
Padikkal  looked so good at the beginning of the IPL. He is unable to get it off the square at the moment.,3
Padikkal just get out ffs. I've been wanting to watch ab for so long.,2
"r/cricket : just hit the ball

The batsmen: why didn't I think of that?",22
I just want a Roy-Buttler/Bairstow like opening partnership for India before we head to the T20 World Cup,1
Was the water guy looking at Stoke's ass?,2
Rahul __WIDE__watia,2
Google goes from 53 to 62% for RCB with just a six. Still more sensible than /r/Cricket.,3
thank you,2
Who tf was screaming there,3
Oh noooooo - every RR fan,9
"What a shitty shot, does he have like zero power.",2
Padikkal out,1
"I just came, guys",3
"One or two boundaries can change your strike rate, kohli is striking at 140, not bad though. Padikkal should do something other than dots and singles now",2
Match losing innings,6
Left right combination?,3
Bow down to Brian lara,7
Looooooooorrrrrrrrrrrdddddddddd,4
God's Plan.,1
How many extras is that by RR now?,2
Poor Padikkal had a bad day,10
What a relief there for RCB.,7
This is a Koach masterclass. His running will win RCB the game.,6
Finally. Now RCB have a chance to win this.,7
Please Kohli be celebrating.,2
Paddikal should just retire and let ABD in,5
Painful innings lmao,10
DDP should get out so ABD can run with VK,8
Ben Stokes looks uncomfortable 👀,6
What a chutiya innings by Paddikkal,9
"Kohli * exists *

Commentators: 2016 !!!",11
That was becoming painful.,4
I hope they are keeping the left right combo,5
Damn Tewatia is such a fucking cunt.,4
Thank fuck,6
Please send abd lol,6
Such a shit innings.,6
One of the worst innings I have seen. Smh,14
In the context of this chase this is a horrendous innings from Paddikal!,14
Advantage RCB,4
Fuck off padikkal.. useless,-3
Good for RCB,3
35 off 37,3
Thank fucking god! Finally,5
Good riddance,4
"How is that a well made 35, are you retarded?",13
Thanks a lot tewatia.,6
Oh no. Rajasthan in trouble now,5
"Don’t be a daft cunt RCB, and send AB.",5
Paddikal disappointing innings,3
That was coming.,1
Not sure if this is a win for RR or RCB with AbD coming in next.,6
YOU FUCKING BASTARDS GET ABD,7
Benjamin,2
RCB fans celebrating,6
Send ABD now,3
Idiot Tewatia screaming as if he has gotten VK's wicket.,5
RCB back in the game now !!!,2
That's the break through RR is not looking for.,3
Should’ve dropped him.,0
No kidding we should try Rishabh Pant opening in T20Is. No way we will win WT20 with slow opening partnership. Look at England and how they exploit the powerplay overs,2
Well played Padikkal. My boy. Halla bol.,2
"Nice, perfect time for AB to come in",2
"Get Ben Stokes off the field, my man looks like he's gonna break down in a few minutes.",3
Oh where's the left hander?,2
"Oh noooo


Anyway",14
"Fucking get Stokes off the field, the dedicated fucker will off himself in this heat with his suspected injury. We need him for the rest of the tournament.",5
Why are RR celebrating?,6
Good riddance,3
"Important wicket, lol. RR would have preferred having Paddikal on crease",6
"Oh lord. If ABD gets out, we are screwed.",3
Finally Paddikal,1
"oh no, it’s ABD",4
Lord u've disappointed many of us with ur attitude but u did perform good today.... I hope rr wins some games and u take a chill,2
RCBs game to lose here tbh. 11 an over for 7 overs with 8 wickets in hand with 2 of your best batsman and with Tyagi and Unadkat in the other team. Damned if they lose this.,3
Koach outrunning Devdutt speaks volumes about his fitness levels.,5
Turning point of the match. Getting Paddikkal out.  RCB to win now.,1
"No more experiments, we need a rapid fire innings to win this one.",1
Stokes doesn't have Uthappam smarts to keep ABD off strike,2
was that Tewetia groaning into the stumps,1
Unironically should've dropped that on purpose,8
"fuck finally. even if ab gets out cheaply, anybody else can do what padikkal has been doing after the pp if not even better",7
"RCB is not that dumb,of course AB is in next after that disaster Las time",3
"Paddikal, RCB's Himbo",3
Was that Tewatia with the primal scream. Kohli will be impressed.,5
It's good for rcb cleary today was not his day,3
"**12.6** Tewatia to Padikkal, OUT, dropped slow and short outside off, forces him to try and clear the ground with a pull. Not enough power on that and it's an easy take for Stokes. This isn't too different from the ball Kohli hit for six, except that it's climbing away from a tiring batsman **102-2**

D Padikkal c Stokes b Tewatia 35 (37b 2x4 0x6) SR: 94.59",3
People were saying Parthiv can't score after the PowerPlay but neither can Padikkal,3
Tewatia screaming..,1
"Just a bad day for DDP, when he is performing wow great has 1 bad game gtfo seriously?",5
Hello biscuit,3
"Y’all chill. They will send ab out, they admitted that their strategy to play against leggies didn’t work yesterday",3
finally will they send ab or sundar?,1
"RCB should send in AB. And if either one of them gets out, then it should be Morris. They literally have been bailed out by the wides by RR today. Not much margin left the with the balls remaining considering the pitch is gripping.",1
"Padikkal should start going early next time, he’s definitely not a player that can play 20 overs",2
We need a quick fire innings from AB.,4
Get used to not having Swann in the dugout. The one who flew too close to the sun.,2
Absolutely useless innings by Paddikal. He has no stamina. He s the new Shubman Gill,2
DP world sponsoring RCB makes send when ADV and Kohli are batting,1
"> AB de Villiers is in at 4. RCB with some radical moves.

lol cricinfo",5
Bring the leggies for ABD,1
"Tewatia.... that really didn't deserve such a loud reaction, you were bowling absolute rubbish before that",2
"Archer n gopal

Next 2 overs in any order plzz",1
"If you've played 37 balls in an innings chasing 178, you should at least be scoring 65, not 35.",6
"Uhh, that's why I hate slow innings after playing 30+ balls in T20. You look way worse than getting out at 12(8).",4
"
DDP has to work on fitness. He’s tiring out after 35 balls. I know it’s hot, but other players don’t struggle as much",4
"Not easy for RCB. There, I said it.",1
Lord lord lord,2
"RCB fans, tell me the truth, are you all disappointed or glad that Padikkal got out?🤣😂",2
Finally some ABD,2
Tewatia. What a player.,1
"Virat kohli bega out ago.

Translation : Virat kohli needs to play cautious now.",2
LORRRRRRDDDDDDD,4
Hesson didn't have a Eureka moment today thankfully.,1
ABD is in. This is completely unexpected from RCB.,2
"Commentators: ""Padikkal is out.""

RR fans: Yayyyyyy

Commentators: ""Coming to crease, AB de Villiers""

RR fans:🥺🥺🥺",1
Bhenchod,4
HOLY FUCKING SHIT,7
LMAO redeeming himself,6
Padikkal looked like he'd climbed a mountain or something.,2
Tewatia is the true god.,5
"Bruh Tewatia, I can't believe you",3
🙏,3
Imagine doubting the Lord,4
"Sensible thing would be to send AB out now, so I guess Chahal is in next?",3
Oh no,2
Lord is 3D,6
You really just cannot keep the lord out of the game,4
That was actually a decent shot....,5
The lord strikes again😳🤣😂,1
Lord Tewatia doing it again,1
Lord wtf is this,1
Lord taketh,1
Fuckkk!,1
Tewatia you beauty <3,3
Lord fields in mysterious ways,3
LORD,3
Surprised Pikachu,1
"It's clean catch , good job.",5
Lord!,1
Fuck.,4
Tewatia legit carrying RR on his back.,3
Scenes if AB gets out to legspinner in next over lol,3
"Idk, rcb is managing this pretty well.",2
I blame padikkal. Fuck that guy,6
The Lord works in mysterious ways :),7
"AB at 4?

What sort of crazy tactic is this, he's much better at... 

*checks notes*

Uhhhh, 6",10
Bow down to the Lord!!,7
Req Rate under 11.  This should not be difficult.,2
Yo wtf man.,3
Lord takes out Kohli,7
"Cut the guy some slack, he's 19 ffs.",7
Koach what are u do,3
LORD TEWATIA!,1
"Lord Tewatia at it, that's a beautiful catch.",5
"Poor from Padikkal, when he wasn't connecting he should have hit and got out earlier. He played 33% of total balls and scored less than 20% of the target.",12
FUCKING LORDDD MANNNN,4
Lord Tewatia is the find of IPL 2020,13
Kohlappse,4
Good catch. Bad for RCB.,6
"That was traveling with the speed of light, good catching",6
lol wut,2
Lord tewatia saving RR again,11
Bring in gopal and hope for a miracle of their wickets in same over,2
Tewatia is GOD,3
Lord works in mysterious ways,4
"Lord , god what",1
Stunner from the Lord,1
Lord works in mysterious ways,8
Lord Tewatia can predict future. He screamed in advance coz he knew he'll get Kohli out soon,11
"The Lord showing r/Cricket its place.

Unfortunately that means he's gonna behave more like a Twatia now.",8
Didn’t appear clean at first glance,3
Chutiya caught chutiya,-5
This is not going to help RCB or Tewatia's ego. Lose lose all around,15
Tewatiya making up for bowling so many wides.,3
Just make tewatia the captain already,2
"Well, Padikkal definitely needs to improve his power hitting.",5
Oh brother,3
How many 2s this over?,1
Tevatia is also a gun fielder hmmm,6
These boundary catches are enough to show that cricket nowadays is off a much higher level than ever before.,10
Lord shows Kohli who's the boss!!,8
"Guys, I just came again",6
Can't keep Lord out of the game,7
The lord giveth wides and taketh match winning catches.,5
Kohli bcmc,4
That's a great catch.,5
My.... LORD,2
*Well who's the idiot now?* Tewatia to me.,7
Your saviour is here!!,3
THE LORD IS HERE,5
Lord tewatia what a catch! We bow down to you!,9
Lol RCB is done.,8
Paddikkal needs to build some muscle before next season,13
Lord!!!!,7
kohli-ab bromance status: ❌,13
Congrats RR,9
Lord Labakkudaas,7
Oh NO,5
Rohul spoil the party tewatia,6
Fucking Hell Tewatia wtf,10
"When you can pull off things like that, you can afford to be a cunt🤷‍♂️",10
Obviously it had to be Tewatia,7
Tewatia wow,9
This is tewatia’s ipl guys.,10
Chase is dead boys,5
"Stop shitting on DDP, looks like the pitch is really slowing down. He could've played a fair foil if batsmen on the other end were finding it easy.",3
Fuck me. Game over.,5
See what DDP’s slug innings did here,9
"That's how you take a catch, les go lord tewatia",5
Koach stayed at the crease exactly as long as the lord allowed him to.,8
was that curran and miller? lol epic reactions,6
Why has this tailender come out to bat at 4?,13
"Man I salute you Lord Tewatia, I have nothing else to say. Please ABD SAVE US",22
"The rise, the fall, the redemption. Teawatia's got it all for you in one match.",20
Lord..,2
Lord🤩,2
Tewatia's chances of making it to Indian squad just decreased because he caught Koach.,18
An unlikeable guy like tewatia doing well is peak 2020,11
Im loving the reaction of the RR guys over the boundary line,10
"RCB should get PP in place of Gurkeerat and M Ali for Finch. Stronger middle order, more bowling option and reduced workload of ABD.",7
Tewatia is golden god!,3
"Oh fuck me, this is on Padikall",3
One of the best catches of the season so far for me,3
Smh I am sad now :(,2
Tewatia has to be the mvp of this tournament.,5
Tewatia impressing everyone with his fielding as well now..,3
"**L O R D**  
**O**  
**R**  
**D**",4
THE LORD STRIKES AGAIN,5
"Lord shocks his own teammates. 
Such are the wonders of Lord.",8
Bye bye now.,3
Man RCB is going to break AbD.,4
Game set and the match.,4
"That's game, fudge",2
How sweet it is!,4
"Yup that time again, AB, it's that time again. Please save us.

(EDIT: HE DID IT ONCE AGAIN!)",4
He deserves to curse at anyone who drops a catch,6
I guess this is down to a one-man show now. Can AbD pull this off?,3
where’s the “tewatia’s so cocky he needs to be put in place” camp now,11
"God Level Catch, Holy shit.",4
Yo is gurkeerat actually going to get a chance to bat? This is insane,9
This makes me 😭,2
Lord Tewatia !!!,1
"ABD: *comes in*

Kohli: ight imma head out",17
LORD TEWATIA I THINK I LOVE YOU,3
Gurkeerat: My time has come,7
"Unpopular opinion: those kinda catches have to be banned. If you cross the rope and then come back, it should be a 6. It’s like exploiting the loopholes in the rules. 
If you wanna catch, catch it behind the rope.

Edit: I get that ball didn’t cross the rope things, but the player did. I mean I consider the boundary a holy line kind of thing. 
Athletic? All cool. Remember when ABD took that superman catch or QDK took that amazing catch last season? That’s cricket. Not trying to find loopholes in the rules. 

Always had this opinion. Not since today’s match.",-17
Did Rahul just Tewati-Ed this game in two balls,6
Lord works in mysterious ways. That's all i have to say,3
Finally Gurkeerat getting the batting,1
Hahahahaha. r/cricket does it again. The Lord is back!!,3
Lord has cancelled RCB today!!!,2
Is there nothing the lord cannot do?,7
Into the tail,1
"Who's the better batsman? 

Like for ab de villiers

Comment for Washington sundar",-5
Tewatia just singlehanded you saving RR,5
"Nooooo, not Kohli. ABD is great and all but can't really trust him to finish the game..",2
"Hardik at #6, Jadeja at #7 and Tewatia at #8 for Indian LOI side",2
Too bad there's no place for Tewatia in India XI.,7
"**13.1** Kartik Tyagi to Kohli, OUT,  **102-3**

V Kohli c Tewatia b Kartik Tyagi 43 (32b 1x4 2x6) SR: 134.37",2
"Tewatia almost slipped & fell down when he came back for the catch, his body’s angle defied gravity, well done Tewatia",9
I swear I just went off the screen after Padikkal was out and came back to see Lord's magic.,5
Hypothetically if some one deliberately dropped a catch in a crunch situation of a batsman who is not playing well would they be fined or punished for being against the spirit of game or something?,3
Surely lord should play for India over Jadeja,3
ABD please perform today!!!,7
Shaata,3
"Hahaha RCB, get Tewatiyad",2
Big opportunity for gurkeerat,1
Has unadkat ever stopped the ball cleanly ?,2
Tewatia has been the best Indian all-rounder this IPL?,11
Gurkeerat on pitch. Unbelievable.,7
Lol how can Kohli keep justifying these sorts of innings? Absolutely atrocious batting.,1
Kohlapse incoming.,2
Bow to the Lord,2
"Kohli sees AB coming in:  


""Ight, imma head out"".",9
I wish I had the confidence of Tewatia.,6
"Wow, this sub is truly weird. When Kohli does it, it’s called passion, when our Lord does it, it’s called arrogance. I mean what do you want him to do? Say please & thank you ? Our lord doesn’t do that.",10
All thanks to DDP,1
Gurkeerat finally gets a chance to bat. Chance coz he at non striker. Anything can happen when tewatia on the pitch.,1
"Dhoni would have fucked the umpire in the ass, asserting his dominance and getting the wide call reverted.",5
"Super V ? NO, SUPER T !!!!",3
Padikkal has been found out slightly. He needs to tweak his game a little to adapt to this standard.,2
how many fucking wides in this game!,1
That was so enjoyable,1
There goes my Dream 11 career. I have had 4 losses in a row in 4 days.,7
Where is Sanju Samson PR campaign last few weeks btw,5
Tewatia mofo is everywhere,8
Came here to cum collectively on Lord Tewatia,7
Shout like Dhoni the ump might overturn.,3
Smith should bowl a over!,2
Tewatia is 2nd in the mvp list after Archer.,7
Lord had this all planned out. Roasting Uthappa was a part of his grand plan along with 20 wide deliveries he bowled.,4
RR paid 12 crore for Stokes only for him to end up as the 2nd best all-rounder on the team...,13
"Rift confirmed between vk and abd, they don't want to bat together",11
I don’t think unadkat is capable of fielding cleanly,0
How does Tewatia have a game changing moment every time lmao,18
Tyagi!!! What a find! More impressive than Nagar-mavi,6
God Tewatia loves his redemption Arcs doesn't he,9
Only time will tell if Tewatia becomes a Asnodkar/Valthaty type or if he will be an India player,10
"If RR lose today its cause of their shitty fielding, wtf is wrong with this team.",2
Lord is really Arjuna Ranatunga 2.0. Doesn't give a fuck about the world and gets the job done with in-your-face confidence.,10
9 wides by RR. Absolutely shocking.,2
"Okay if Lord can pull that off, his tirade at Uthappa for missing that difficult catch off his bowling can be excused.",10
"The real 3D player, Lord Tewatia",5
Tyagi or someone needed to back it up,3
Every bouncer Tyagi has tried today has gone down leg side. Fix your lines dude.,7
fuck I wanna see mann play at least a ball,4
That partnership between Devdutt and Virat really got RCB nowhere.,5
"Still expecting an AB classic, though this is not the Chinnaswamy..but still",3
"Gotta give credit to Kohli, he showed intent early and often. His timing just wasn't there.",7
Royals vs Royally Challenged rn,8
"Lol Gurkeerat almost got out without facing a ball

Dude thinks his role is specialist fielder",14
dugout must let go of bangar..,7
I hope ABD fails so that top 3 get some sense of how to start a chase. He can’t keep bailing them out,9
"I know that's a really good catch, but those sort of boundary catches kinda bore me now. Give me a spectacular dive over that anyday",5
AB Dotvilliers,4
[deleted],6
Tyagi stifling ABD! Wow,3
why are we still here?,3
ABD giving Archer fielding practice,3
C H O K E,1
RCB at 27%. Google doesn't trust ABD.,4
damn tewatia is 27. i thought he was as old as amit mishra,5
"Put them in order according to their performance please Kartik Tyagi, Shivam Mavi, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Arshdeep Singh",3
"Can Tewatia get a shot for the national team, seeing as we need a second all-rounder that can smash the ball like Hardik.",6
Tyagi is a gem,1
rcb really needs to start taking a more aggressive approach to powerplays. cant depend on ab every game,2
RCB will cook this and take the L,2
"~Under pressure! Pressing down on me, pushing down on you, no man asked for.~",1
Is goatee still a fashion?,0
11 extras from RR!,3
"They say lightning doesn't strike twice. 

But Lord Tewetia strikes again and again.",2
"Ashish nehra for God's sake. 

Yorker is the only bowl in T20 that a batsman can't hit. 

Period. 

How long is he going to go on about Length ball?",2
Kohli was called extremely arrogant when he started out...for his celebrations..ppl will accept Tewatia sooner or later,5
"Shreyas ""ABD killer"" Gopal will be coming in next.",5
Hoping for an ABD show now...,3
2020's weirdness includes Tyagi owning ABD,3
Wow ABD selling him down the river,3
Gopal should bowl next over.,1
"Gurkerat be like i don't what to do.

Fuckin Kohli keeps dropping me for fun and abd wants to sacrifice me to get of the mark.",10
Wtf! I go in to wash my face and come back to see both Padikkal and Virat gone. :/,4
"Next three overs are important, once deVilliers is settled, match is fucked for RR",2
"RCB doing what they do best all this team, screwing things up.",7
"What's Kohli angry about? Is he questioning the grace, the mightiness that is Lord T ?",20
I'm beginning to think RR may pull off a heist this year,3
Can anyone do the permutations for RCB in the playoffs after today's loss?,4
Wonderful tight bowling from RR in last few overs,2
Why is kohli angry tho?,3
uh.. hit some direct hits folks.,3
"I want RCB to lose this but I don't want RR to win by a big margin.

Ah, the dilemma one faces as a CSK fan in 2020.",6
RCB well on course to lose two in a row. Thanks to extraordinary tactics in the last game.,6
"Bangar is a goddam buzzkill...irritating voice , low on energy and shit tier analyses . Bhagaao isko",1
[deleted],3
Lmao Nehra calling Pant's chubby arms muscles,-1
I like this Tyagi. Him and Jaiswal were the players who I saw play against Aus in the U 19 WC,5
Wow 145kph speed ball from Kartik Tyagi,3
"Kohli demotes Ab to 6 last game 

Gets out as soon as Ab comes out to bat this game

Rift confirmed??",14
Noice pace from the man willing to sacrifice,-1
"OOTL, why are people saying Tewatia has a shit attitude? He comes across as a dick to me too, but any particular incident?",4
Tigh bowling,2
"Hopefully Finch is throw out  after this. 

Koach needs to start opening again, make full use of the powerplay",10
"Well-done Tyagi ,tght over. You created opportunities,if only one of these are direct hits. Smh",6
"[RCB win still possible, but I want to go for premature celebration](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jcrdch/match_thread_33rd_match_rajasthan_royals_v_royal/g935a0y/)",2
Why not send morris jfc,0
I love how r/cricket went from loving to hating to loving tewatia in a span of 10 mins,6
Gurkeerat do something please,1
"If Tewatia doesn’t go to Australia, we riot.",6
This is really tough even for AB with 2 overs of legspin left and no batting to come,6
At last we see Mann play a ball,9
"It's just normal bowling, but RCB batsman are struggling..",8
Good INTENT from RR,1
Batsmen caring about their average more than the chase. How can you go into a chase well aware of the run rate and pat it around to 35 with a below 100 SR?,3
"As a neutral I want RR to win.

Would make the points table more interesting.",9
Last ball was 145+ lmao from Tyagi,6
This over has killed the game.,4
I think this is it for Finch (justifiably) and Gurkeerat (for shits and giggles once again),2
Game over boys,1
Rahul tewatia is the actual 3D player for india,6
Kohli's furious at the cameraman for repeatedly panning to him after every ball -\_-,7
What an over,1
Fuck we play DC today. Going to get wrecked,0
Who’s the fielding coach of RR again ?,2
just to suffer,2
"As JBL once said: If you are that good, you should be arrogant.

Look at Ponting",2
No way rcb is winning this with 2 archer overs left,2
This ground is too big for AbD to play his SR 200+ kinda innings.,2
"Man, DC is gonna eat CSK alive in the next match.",1
Give Man of the tournament to Lord Already!!,1
Tewatia you beauty!!!,0
Clutch over,1
Guys is stokes injured i saw him limping when he was fielding,5
Why do they treat ab like a slogger? He's a genuine innings builder and needs time to get set. Please get him at 3 or something and kohli in the powerplay where he has more freedom.,5
I wonder what a more consistent opener would do for this lineup,2
For a moment there I thought RCB might make the playoffs,12
"Hopefully dehli win the next game.

Rr and Csk are my least favorite games, I can’t handle them both winning in the same day",3
AB Vs leg spin.,1
You know RCB middle order is a meme when your batsman misses out on a full toss.,3
Sir Jadeja is just a discount Lord Tewatia tbh. Can't believe the former is the one that got famous first smh,2
RCB is terribly unbalanced. Stacking mediocre bowlers and non existent middle order. Recipe for a disaster if top 3 doesn't fire.,7
Archer the least economical today lmao,3
ABD v. Unadkat will decide the fate of this game.  Very good chance he will go beserk.,8
Gopal vs ABD wonderful battle,1
Still RCB's game as long as AB is in the middle,2
"Royals must have the most big EGOs in a team, no wonder they aren't clicking

Archer Gold Chains Twitter Nostradamus

You Fucking Mankad Knobb Head Buttler

Sanju Afridi Samson

Ben World Cup Stokes

IPL Billionaire Unadkat

Steve Spectrum Bradman Smith

Harbhajan Twatia

Tom I will beat you like my little Brother Curran

Andrew West Coast Great Tye",13
The guy who said unpopular opinion - catches outside boundaries should be six. Fuck off mate. That’s a real unpopular opinion all right. It’s a batsman game already. If you don’t wanna get caught then hit bigger sixes.,16
why do i feel that pollard could win it from here but abd cannot?,5
ABD does have horrendous numbers against leggies and especially against Gopal..,9
"Put someone at deep fine leg /square leg for ABD, then bowl them googlies a little wideish",3
"How are Rcb struggling so much today? What’s wrong,is it the pitch or the lack of intent?",5
Shreyas Gopal is ABD's kryptonite.,6
Are they actually not being swann back,2
Maybe ab should just play this over out.,3
"I'm out of the loop, why do people think Tewatia is unlikable?",2
[deleted],7
Kohli s bad judgments stay hidden behind his batting,3
"As long as Unadkat still has 2 overs left, RCB still has a chance",6
Gurkeerat finally getting a run.,1
"How far out of the Indian T20I side is Tewatia at the moment?

I know that he is in the form of his life, but he looks like a complete allrounder right now. I’ve been impressed every time I’ve seen him play.",9
Please bring swann back,2
I am getting suspicious of this many wides.,-4
I'm so happy that they got Ashish Nehra to do Hindi Commentary. Best thing after his appearance on Breakfast with Champions!,6
Kohli's expressions never stop giving,3
Total 2 boundaries in last 9 overs by RCB.,2
"CMV: Kohli and Paddikal lost this match, even if either of them had gotten out for 35(20) it would've been much better for the momentum.",1
[deleted],2
"RCB batting: VK, ABD, Morris.  

RCB bowling: Morris, Saini, Washington, Chahal",4
"Lord Tewatia vs Lord Uthappa for man of the match, hardest decision yet. Don't even consider Smith's 50.",7
Extras gonna outscore Finch lol,17
Padikkal playing like Parthiv here. He needs to be more fearless like how he was in the first 2 games.,14
morris next?,8
Tyagi boi!! 👌,1
"Unless someone plays a blinder, this is RR's game. Seems like RCB is trying to be reverse CSK. qualify on points bit have shitty nrr cause of losing with big margins.",8
"If RR loses this, its because of the free runs they are giving to RCB",14
Nice effort from young lad,3
Great fielding lmao tyagi looked like a gazelle running there with his long ass legs,13
"The formula for DDP should be: if you’re at run a ball after 20 balls, either hit or get out",19
God this Tyagi is a serious cricketer,13
When will the obligatory big Ab&Virat partnership come? I’m desperately waiting,11
Unreal that RCB sent Gurukeerat. You have Morris. Who can go balls to the walls. You don’t have many runs overs left. When are you gonna bring him in? When you need 40 off 6?,9
"""Yorker pe Wicket nhi milegi""

I want archer to get a wicket of a Yorker just when nehra says this.",8
LoL they took on Smith and ran 2.,4
rcb has really struggled with finding boundaries these past couple of games,9
"Gurkeerat should show some INTENT, still Morris to come",5
AB really deserves a better team around him.,10
"Rcb top order is trying to play too safe, maybe because of their earlier collapses but if they want to be consistent they need to start going from the beginning",6
Poor gurkeerat is gonna get dropped next match.,5
So all the batsman struggle against archer and legspin? Might as well call it t8,8
"looked promising on paper and in the first few games, but rcb is just as reliant on kohli and ab like always",7
Why I am getting ads on Hotstar Dugout?,1
"As a neutral I don't mind it, but if my team is batting and they make a wicket alert on dugout and start praying for the fall of a wicket on every fucking ball, it gets pretty irritating.",6
Fielding has been nothing short of embarrassing.,2
1 bad match. 1 bad match is all what it takes to trigger armchair cricketers over here,6
It's still RCB's game to lose.,4
RR  could have easily saved around 15runs if they were a little disciplined in the field and bowled less wides,3
The way people are dissing Tewatia for showing emotion smh. Have you guys played cricket at club level at least?,12
Still pretty doable,3
Gurkeerat need to hit out or get out,6
Time for them to start firing. No point in holding back now.,6
Here comes Archer. Wicket incoming imo.,3
SWANNNNN,6
Is it only me or Paddikal is playing the self game too much?,12
Is AB capable of another 20 run over and chasing the face of this game.,5
"Archer has 2 overs left, 64 to score. So more or less 50 off 3 overs to score.",2

Riyan Parag also bowls leg spin why not using him,3
"2 overs frm archer

2 frm unadkat.. 

Donno which is more crucial",3
RCB were on a roll but then Kohli's big brain strategies derailed the momentum.,7
Cuck Star,3
Swanny apologising lmaooo,8
Shouldn’t have bowled archer now,3
What was the word that swaney said lol,5
looks like swann got a phone call from the PR department eh,6
We have wickets in hand but no batsmen,2
Censor Board just forced Swann to apologise lmfao,6
What do you guys think of Swann? I feel he is overacting on his joker role.,2
What did Swann do?,3
"I feel like you should be allowed to swear on dugout, can’t believe they made him apologize.",7
Ab is counting on Unad overs,2
Respect Swann,5
What did Swann say? My mom said I'm old enough to know.,7
Smith trying to kill the chase but that also means Unadkat bowing in the death,2
Nice to see Swann's really having a nice time,2
ugh yorker king archer,1
"If De Villiers struggles against leggies RCB really should have sent Chahal in ahead of him.

After all, who can play a legspinner better than a legspinner? Chahal could figure out what Gopal was doing and then get bowled anyway.",2
"Oh come on, making Swann apologize for that shit. It was harmless.",3
Swann apologizing for using the F- word.  Hope he isn't crucified by the PC brigade.,5
should have taken out unadkat over here instead of archer,1
"This is looking tough for RCB now. RCB fans, what do you think??",4
Swanny apolozising for the accidental F bomb.,5
"Fucking Smash Gurkeerat

Morris still to come",4
Gurkeerat doing a good job to give strike.,2
Tewatia and Swann could make the greatest romantic song of all time .,6
Imagine sending gurkeerat ahead of morris,10
"Where has the Kohli gone who use to love chases and would give 110% for every target? Huh 
This just seems to be someone else. The Kohli we all know never chased the game,he always likes to stay on top of the game. What happened now? Maybe I’m overreacting over one game but hey some things need to change",12
Chasing in this IPL.... something about it,4
DDP preventing ABD getting enough balls to play,9
This will be a hard chase for rcb now.,2
Excellent from Archer,3
remember when ab took on peak steyn? yeah ab pls do that against archer today,2
This is rcb's game to lose tbh,3
I can sense Kohlapse,3
If unadkat can bowl his two overs well then the match is RRs,2
Who's remaining to take over if Gurkeerat sacrifices?,1
Lol they made swann apologize. Swann's rants are 69% of the reason the dugout is entertaining.,7
What did Swann actually say?,1
Who is sitting with Harsha and bishop,1
Jean Paul is all of a sudden looking handsome BTW,1
Swann said fr\*ck,2
"Why not have uthappa as keeper, samson fields well",2
Come on Swann show some big dick energy tell them to get fucked,2
"Archer plays a nearly unplayable delivery 

r/cricket to the batsman: just smash it bro",10
we are too dependent on kholi and abd,4
"What's a single fuck when players are screaming madarchod bhenchod chutiya every minute. You cant hear it, but you dont need to be a lip reading pro to see it.",4
"If RCB fail to qualify for play-offs this year as well, finally the T20i captaincy should be handed to Rohit. Period. 

Not that he is terrible, just that Rohit is better",4
How does unadkat get paid so much every auction after performing poorly? Is it some kind of money laundering or what,2
See what lack of match practice does. Anyone other than Gurkeerat would’ve put that away,3
Ah,3
WTF is that chain Jofra?,3
Finally a good fucking batsman.,3
Rcb can't do this..... abd can't always save their ass,8
Archer please no more fucking slower balls smh,3
Who has been the best umpire this IPL?,4
"Captaincy from these two captains have been polar opposites. Smith the best,sadly Kohli the worst",5
Take that bitch,-4
It's showtime,1
"For RCB to win this, the two Unadkat overs should go for 30 atleast!",14
Just ball Yorker Archer.,2
"They've been talking about AB batting too low for 5 overs now. We get it man, nobody with a sound mind would want AB to bat at #6. It's not like you're providing us with some deep insights here.",7
"Length ball goes for a six. 

Nehra - Pikachuface",8
Indian Aunties get jealous every time camera is on Archer. My man is stacking.,20
"Archer econ: 9.5

Unadkat econ: 6.0

It’s pretty clear who the better bowler is. /s",24
Ab is the only one who can do a Tewatia against team Tewatia,14
God he made that look SO easy,4
Yess ABD is doing it!,5
Fuckin keep away Gurkeerat from strike,0
can smudge bowl an over just for fun,2
You literally have zero margin for error against de Villiers.,14
"It's almost like rcb selects the batsman least likely to hit , and keeps the big hitters out of the game",4
Unadkat gonna bowl 2 lol cakewalk for RCB if AB stays put,1
Who is that girl in white shirt and very long hair in rcb camp?,3
Morris' bowling may well be the difference between the two sides.,1
Commentators jinxing it heavy saying shift in momentum right after a boundary,6
Yes Ab let’s make Kohli or whoever the fuck thought sending u at 6 was a good idea regret it for the rest of their life.,3
"Why they are not trusting Morris the batsman, this is ridiculous",4
"If RR wins this, the credit should go to PADDIKAL",4
What is the point of gurkeerat if he's only gonna take singles ? Isn't paddikal and kohli enough for that ?,5
Come ON RR,6
Just hit more boundaries and win the game fivehead whats so hard about that? Easy game,3
Lmao why would you bench dube,11
10 runs from an archer over is pretty good for RCB. Just smash Unadkat all over UAE,7
Morris should have come in instead,5
Two overs from unadkat is too much for any player to turn the match around.,8
Archer getting smashed for 3 sixes in a match??? Unadkat is ur strike bowler smudge /s,4
"It is kinda sad, year in year out, they have to rely on ABD to bail them out yet again...sigh  my heart can't take being an RCB fan. ABD deserves better",22
Archie and his 10 tole ki chain.,4
Seriously screw this strategic time out.,9
Sending Dube instead of AbD last game & Gurkeerat instead of Morris now. We really suck at utilizing our resources correctly.,9
tHe BiGeSt CrImE i CaN cOmMiT,4
Expecting Carnage in Unadkat's 2 overs. Smith might even be forced to give an over to Stokes.,3
"Gurkeerat needs to show intent every ball, even if it means getting bowled.",6
Who would get offended by Swann accidently saying Fuck?,1
Does anyone missing BigBoi Dubey,2
Rr will lose this game,1
Wow now I think RCB is really missing Kohli. He was set and just threw his wicket. He would have been excellent as support to ABD and could have chipped in too. Way better than Gurkeerat.,1
Fucking unadkat man. He'll surely give away runs.,1
"Gurkeerat is a good pinch hitter, if only he can get the momentum going",1
"ABD or bust, if he doesn't score big they win.",6
"RCB going to lose against MI,DC for sure. They had to win this one.",7
"Over rate seems good, they'll wrap up at around 7-15, that's great even with all those extras.",2
"Another ""strategic"" timeout? Aren't 30 second commercial breaks between every single over enough you greedy fucks?",4
54 from 4 is easy with AB at the crease and 2 overs of Unadkat left,2
Another hdfc bank ad???? (Although this was kinda wholesome to the mom),1
2 20 run overs from unadkut comming up,2
Unadkat has everything in his hand now to improve his reputation and justify his price tag.,1
[deleted],17
"We all know RCB don't deserve to win this b/c of their batting in the middle overs. 

Now their ~~no 6~~ best batsman is trying to steal a win away from RR.",1
[deleted],7
Does Gurkeerat intentionally throw his wicket now and get Morris in?,1
The only things more irritating that tiktok are these tiktok knock offs,3
Unadkat overs are essential here,2
"People should calm down ffs, ab was pushed down for only one match and they even kinda admitted that it was a bad move",5
"If ABD plays 15 of the remaining 24 balls, RCB will win this.",2
"Why does Gurkeerat play? When he gets to bat, RCB fans complain and when he doesn't bat, they feel bad for him. Sell him back to KXIP.",5
in b4 unadkat starts bowling like rabada,7
Unadkat is the only hope now,7
[deleted],-3
I feel that last over from morris would be the game changer here,1
So given how much he is being criticised at the moment Unadkat is going to come out and bowl a double-wicket maiden right?,4
"If RCB win this from here, I’ll vote for Biden",8
Everyone's struggling,5
Need a 22 run over from Unadkat,7
Pls guys I beg you don’t jinx it by saying this is easy for Ab considering unadkat has 2 and then he ends getting out to him,5
Cricket is a great sport,4
Gurkeerat fuck.,6
Fucking wasting precious Unadkat freebees,4
Devdatt and kohli slowed down too much. Thats where they lost the match and gurkeerat will sadly have to be the scrapegoat.,10
ffs should have given this over to Tyagi,1
Nobody is getting abd out after he hit one six right? Then give strike to gurkeerat,2
Wasting Unadkat balls his absolute criminal here.,9
Wtf??????,3
"Mann has to either hit and maybe get out trying or rotate the the strike.

The biggest crime is sucking up dot balls",6
Wtf Gurkeerat,4
12 extras is genuinely disgraceful. RR have basically had to bowl 22 overs defending 165...,5
"Mann has to hit out or get out. Morris is waiting in the dugout 

Why was he even sent in at this point ?",3
Anyone else think that VK will not make it to the current World T20 XI?,0
Guys throwing shit at Unadkat dude has lead his team to the title in ranji,6
Successfully 2 done 10 more to go xD,3
"Love gurkeerat, but I don't believe he has a role in this team.",2
Hit him Singh,2
Damn that's one less ball of unadkat to AbdV,3
Just get off strike Mann,2
Nothing makes me feel more like home than sipping ginger chai and watching IPL. (6:20 am local here),4
Gurkeerat you useless twat.,2
Morris should have come before Gurkeerat,6
"Virat Kohli's last 6 scores - 43, 48, 33*, 90*, 43, 72*

This is Kohli's highest streak of consecutive 30+ scores in IPL. Only once he had a streak of 5 consecutive thirty-plus scores, which was at the start of 2016 season (75, 79, 33, 80, 100*).",3
Undkat actively shitting on r/cricket rn,3
Wow who is bowling while wearing unadkat's mask?,3
"RCB, what is happening??",2
Cmon Undakat prove that you're worth that 7.8 bid,1
"This good , but pls don't bowl slow balls to ABD",2
Do i dare to dream?,3
3 dot balls,3
RCB shouldn’t be chopping and changing against Punjab and losing momentum. They should’ve won that match,4
"Dafaq, just take a single",5
WHAT THE FUCK,7
How difficult is it to take a single FFS,4
This means two less sixes,3
What the fuck is he doing,4
3 dots....I feel my heart crack,3
First DPD a now gurkeerat. Fuck this team man,2
Fuck off,2
3 fucking dot balls lol,4
Feel like high fiving gurkeerat in the face with a chair,4
Why the hell on earth would they send Gurkeerat ahead of Morris and Washi? No offense to Gurkeerat but he is definitely not a power hitter.,2
3 dot balls in already,4
3 dots against Unadkat?,2
gurkeerat is a thoroughly mediocre player smh,4
God tier Altroz segue,3
Why Mann before Morris. Insane,2
Three Unadkat dots fuck it we're done,2
He better pull a tewatia here,1
If RCB loses it is because of............?,1
Gurkeerat take a fuckin single,6
Gurkeerat is fucking trash.,4
Gurkeerat motherfucker.,2
Morris should have come ahead of Mann,3
Fuck off Mann,1
FML 🤦‍♂️,2
Fucking kill me,2
"If Gurkeerat fails here, I won't blame him. 

You have Sundar, who has batted a heck lot this season and you sent in at NO.4 last game.

You have a ready made six hitter in Morris, who played a great cameo last match.

Why would you send in a dude who has batted 0 balls all season?",8
Gurkeerat will need to pull a lord tewatia here,1
Gotta love it when Unad shrieks and bowls 132kph,1
RCB's game with 2 overs of Unadkat still available.,2
"All u had to do was run. Just tap and turn the strike 
over",4
Mann wasting Unadkat over fuck you!,3
Lol unadkat bowling dots means Ab can't target him.,3
Kagiso Unadkat,7
Wtf you doing gurkeerat,5
absolute trash from gurkeerat,6
Fk Gurkeerat,1
This is why he gets paid millions all the time,3
Just hit wicket man,3
Mustafizur vs Vijay Shankar anyone?,1
Does Archer only wear his chains while bowling lol,3
"Are you kidding me, Gurkeerat!!",2
"welp. RIP keerat Mann, Koach is gonna eat you alive",2
Fml. Lets see rcb in the next one,9
this match is gone. 3 wins of remaining 5 matches will be enough for rcb to qualify?,3
does dc have more tamil players than csk?,1
So the credit should also go to Gurkeerat of RR wins,3
Gurkeerat is hoping for his Tewatia moment.,9
Fml,7
Morris should have come at 5,4
UAE is left hand drive country which means they flew that piece of shit Altroz from India,1
It's over.,2
Terrible by Gurkeerat,3
"RCB's batting game plan has by and large been very simple this tournament. The openers get them off to a decent start, Kohli tries as hard as he can to suck all the momentum out of the innings through the middle, and then everyone prays that AB can salvage something at the end.",10
"Fuck this shit.

Can't believe Mann has played for India",9
That's an Unadkat over wasted.,12
Gurkeerat playing his last IPL game for the season,7
Unadkat already bowled a good over and he just bowled 4 balls yet.,4
Maybe gurkeerat never should have batted,10
"Could've sent Morris in but no, send the guy who hasn't faced a single ball all tournament. Goddamn it's so frustrating being an RCB fan..",14
"Why is everyone being a cunt, unadkat is bowling decently to his field",3
Excellent batting from Gurkeerat,5
Unadcutter,2
Altroz always looks better in Gold. I agree.,3
Ab Hit the fuck out of him pls,2
Man Gurkeerat making Unadkat look like Rabada,5
The match is over. Not even AB can redeem this,2
"True RCB. Give us hope in the first half of the season and then shit the bed in the second half. As unpredictable as this year has been, RCB stays true to form.

Edit: Hail AB!",2
ABD need to farm strike against No.5 what's the point of our middle order,3
Only one legit ball for AB to play because he will have to take single on last ball :/,1
WTF Gurkeerat!!!,1
This is why they were hiding this fucker gurkeerat,1
"RR daytime robbery, 3 dots from Unadkat at the death. No throw at the stumps when gurkeerat wasn't even trying to get back in his crease lol.",2
How tf do you get so many dot balls against unadkat,1
Unadkat statpadding against Gurkeerat,3
"Unadkat building pressure with 1 off 4 , r/Cricket sledging is affecting every player",2
"No one, absolutely no one: 
Scoreboards in Dubai: D/L target after 17 overs",4
what a magnificent shot of archer that was... camerawork on point,3
"What kind of brain dead captain kohli is. He saw Morris hit quite easily last match, still sent this Gurkeerat guy. This type of shitty captaincy doesn't deserve to win matches",5
"Man why do I even support rcb, those random wins just come from single handed knocks from abd or kohli",7
I can sympathise with Gurkeerat but aren’t there better 2nd rung Indian batsmen in India?,4
This reminds me of Vijay Shankar's exploits(future CSK captain btw) Vs Mistafizur Rahman in the nidahad trophy final,10
Keerat wasted 4 deliveries trying to be a hero,3
Unadkat doesn't bowl slower deliveries... He bowls faster delivery,3
"Good job Gurpreet, but should have gave him the strike on last ball.",3
Imagine playing 3 dots in an over of Unadkat,5
"why does rcb make it look so hard to make competent decisions?

morris over gurkeerat is a no brainer",10
Why was Dube dropped,1
"Unadkat is a good bowler, f the haters",7
Shot!!,6
Anyone missing Doobie now,2
The fuck how did it go for six. Looked like it's mistimed shot,12
Whoever decides the batting order at rcb deserves sacking,5
Swann got back to commentary because Ratan Tata called and wanted him back because of how many Altroz -es he sold,3
Dube died for Gurkeerath.,11
Gurkeerat wasted the over,4
And that's why we were shitting on gurkeerat,3
[deleted],6
This is why you need ab on strike damnit,4
Dube or Gurkeerat?,2
AB: Feel like pure shit just want Amla back,12
Moeen should play next game,7
Six lets go baby,3
ABD could have hit  4 6s,4
"3 dot balls off Unadkat with RRR of 13, please go to CSK dude",6
Needs P A C E O F F,2
OH FUCK,1
"Morris had been absolutely trash for DC for two straight seasons. He might do better than Gurkeerat, but he isn't really the match winner with the bat that everybody assumes him to be.",1
This match is still open,2
Ohhhh almost,1
Gurkeerat Singh is Prabhsimran Singh in Disguise,5
Take fucking notes gurkeerat,2
"Taking singles, in the 17th over of a T20, when you need 53 to win.

JustRCBThings!",4
Gurkeerat fuck you. Rcb does not deserve ab.,9
This sub has been telling RCB exactly what 11 should be playing. Their decision making is shit,8
"Easy RCB game, ABD gonna take the game away, look how good touch he is in",1
I ALMOST PISSED MY PANTS,6
He should have just taken a single and kept the strike.,3
Pretty good over by Unadkat.,4
Lmao unadkat pulled out at the last moment,2
"2 was bad, now Gurkeerat is on strike",5
That's the match boys. Ab won't sit quiet.,7
Game changing over from Unadkat. And this time he did it for his own team,7
That's a beautiful car. Get an Altroz. Get an Altroz.,11
Unadkat bowls 4 balls for 1 run. He's shaking his head. It just doesn't feel right to him.,8
"Man the way AB picks them, so much power",2
Why tf did Ab take 2??,6
Samson looks tense as Dhoni,2
Fuck no strike for mann again,3
Unadkut is so bad,-1
"He is in umpire, for fucks sake",2
De Villiers go brrrr,3
Altroz,2
Agent Gurkeerat,3
Tough day to be an RCB and Liverpool fan today,2
. . . 1 Gurkeerat is better Unadkat than Unadkat himself.,4
Lmao match over see y’all in the next thread.,2
"So unlucky, Unadkat deserved that wicket",3
Gurkeerat gonna play 5 dot balls and change strike off of the last ball.,2
rcb playing like csk.,1
*Insert Ravi Shastri meme*,2
Dube's technique may be shit but his big hitting potential is certainly superior to gurkeerat,8
Unadkat slower balls are very effective here.,7
Mann just get ABD on strike at all costs,3
Yeah take 2 so that mann can take a maiden over,2
RCB should just stick to the batting line-up of KKR game.,1
15rpo,1
"Don't worry, Unadkat has one more over. Atleast 20-25 from that",4
Did RCB just find a batsman who can't score off Unadkat?,12
It’s ironic considering this sub was asking for Gurkeerat to be included,7
Actually not a bad over from Unadkat all things considered,5
Gurkeerat Bot Singh,5
"AB seems to be a pretty calm dude, but I think he would be pissed off how RCB aren't giving him many balls to face.",3
Key over this,2
Gurkeerat to do a Tewatia??,1
What’s the opposite if Bazigaar. Cause that’s Gurkeerat. Losing from a winning position.,1
Match depends on more on Gurkeerat rotating strike than Abd hitting sixes,3
Padikkal and Mann will be included in Thala Batting academy Tonight xD,-1
Pinch hitting by Gurkeerat,1
"Gurkeerat to AB - ' We only got 9 of that over and you still nearly got out, I can't carry you'",3
"RR dodged a bullet their, if AB faced those 6 balls it might have been a 20+ over",2
ab start farming strike,1
"Commentators: don't bowl wide, that's a very short boundary. 

Unadkat: uses his galaxy brain, bowls a wide half volley. Six runs. 

Unadkat: _Surprised Pikachu face_",5
"Unadkat should send Gurkreet a christmas card, for keeping the strike away from ABD for 4 of the 6 balls.",5
These umpires are useless.,1
"Bishop: Unadkat would be looking to not ball wides.

Unadkat next ball: balls wide ball and ABD hits for 6",1
that’s what happens when two meme teams are playing each other... 50-50 chance,3
Gurkeerat's career is over. Koach won't forgive this,2
Reckon if Smith has already asked ABD kya plan hei?,1
"People usually have Brain Fade, Only RCB have dead Brain all the time 


ABD scores big , next game let's send him at 6


Washington bowls well in powerplays , let's start with Chahal


Need to score big, let's send in Gurkeerat before Morris


It's going to be long before any team can out meme this one.",6
Atleast 15 from this over,3
I think umpires should give a soft signal for run outs too.. that will prove how shitty they are..,3
"Thodi der ke liye waha goti muh mein tha. 😅

T - ""Balls in mouth kinda moment""",2
Ab could have got 24,2
Yup chance who'll win is 50-50.,2
Unlucky,2
"Kuch din pehle, r/Cricket members hi Gurkeerat ke taarif ke pool bandh rhe the! lol",7
How did he manage to hit it there,2
AB AB AB AB AB,2
[deleted],-2
Ab DeLiVeRs,2
Ipl match threads are toxic af....,5
Gurkeerat’s first game of the year...May be not the best situation to send him ahead of Morris,2
Fuck. Come on no please no,1
One young Indian boi vs one 360 boi from SA,3
How the fuck did he hit that,2
Should have sent in Morris. Gurkeerat has cost them the game,2
DDP Kohli ABD Philippe Washington Dube Shahbaz Morris udana chahal saini is it so hard,1
7(10) and 22(13) - the dichotomy of man,2
"Good ball, bad luck it went for 4",3
YEssssssss lets go,2
"How the hell did that go for a 4, damn unlucky for Tyagi",2
ABD is pure joy to watch,1
I think the madlad AB is gonna finish it off.,2
[deleted],5
They don't deserve AB,6
Safe to say Gurkeerat should stick to cricket and stop retweeting political views on Twitter. I won't say which side he's on but it's not the only thing LEFT for him 😭😂😭😂,2
[deleted],2
Keep gurkeerat in strike,1
"If it's someone's first game, why send them in such a pressure situation. Morris should've came in at 5",2
Holy Cow. That was the perfect Yorker.,1
"Any player this sub bullies performs

Any player this sub praises fails lol",1
why do they keep calling tyagi varun aaron lol,2
Fuck finch. Koach should open and abd at 4...,7
"Hmmm, it's almost as if Morris, an international player who can put bat on ball is better than someone's first innings in the tourney.",7
"Man, fuck Gurkeerat!",7
"This is why AbD is so good , even if you bowl wide Yorker he will still hit you",7
Ab is too nice to say no to gurkeerat.,11
Isn't the Ray of sunlight creating disturbance for the  batsmen,3
"Ayyy gurkeerat on strike, it's over",2
"Come on Gurkeerat, prove the critics wrong.",1
"This is the guy RCB top minds sent at #6 in the previous game because he’s 0.00001% weak against leg spin, what a joke",2
Gurkeerat mf,4
Should deny singles to Gurkeerat at this point,3
Gurkeerat doing a Vijay Shankar,5
Just what the fuck mann,2
Bruh you have morris,2
Tyagi has got serious pace,4
Gurkreet losing the match nicely.,2
Left too much for ABD.,2
Dube shouldn't have been dropped.,1
Still think RCB will win this win two or three balls to spare. 15 an over has become acheivable in the last 4 overs this IPL,2
Gurkeerat you fucker.,5
Bring back  N E G I  he's better than Gurkeerat,1
You stupid ass fuck. Why can't you just give strike to ABD. Useless fuck.,2
Tyagi looks like a very exciting prospect,1
Lmao gukeernath,1
Just get out dude,1
Kartik is bowling fiery yorkers....,1
Robbie remembering his old days looking at mann,1
Really missing Chris Morris right now,1
"as much as it hurts to say this, i think ab is wasting his time at rcb",3
gurkeerat is pulling off a jadhav.,2
Gurkeerat singh plays like mahendra singh,0
This move to send Gurkeerat will lose the match for RCB,2
He's not even muscling it,1
RR is enjoying bowling to Gurkeerat . Thanks to great captaincy from Kohli,1
Gurkeerat wtf,1
"Gurkee losing us this match today, why is he going for hits",1
"Fuck singh. Just fuck off,",1
Gamechanger of the match goes to Gurkeraat Singh,1
tyagi resembles saini,1
Comeon Gurkeerat mannn my man you can do it,2
"Gurkeerat, slowly but steadily winning this match for RR",1
Gurukeerat winning the match for RR,1
He’s nowhere near the ball. Can’t even slog when he tries. SMH,1
Gurkeerat :look at me I am Uthappa now,5
Not sending Morris is another genius strategy.,3
Tyagi and Nattu - death bowling Indian finds of 2020,1
Honestly full tosses have been some of the most effective balls this ipl,2
Tyagi is gaining confidence..,2
Get hit wicket ffs,2
man i am getting depressed....why the fuck is morris in dugout,5
I know he hasn’t been playing but this is just daft,1
Gurkeerat and his premeditated shots.. Sigh!!!,1
"Even if rcb looses, I appreciate rcb helping your South Indian brother out and not giving RR a ridiculous NRR",1
Fucks sake gurkeerat,1
"Best test batsman since bradman and best limited overs batsman of all time in the same domestic match.

Too bad one of them has to lose.",2
Kohli can go fuck himself for bottling this chase,-1
Vijay Shankar vibes ✨,0
"Edges should not count for runs. This will change the game, and previous stats would be uncomparable, but still",-3
Eh...one outside for 6 and it's RCB,2
Gurkeerat is the Imposter,2
strategic drop,1
Hahaha I remember Gurkeerat played an ODI for India. How the fuck,2
Ian Bishop calls them R'n'R and I find it very disturbing,3
What the fuck was that? He cant even swing it properly.,2
Hit wicket pls,2
Rip Gurkeerat Mann's IPL career 🙏,7
Better to have an extra bowler than picking this guy,5
That catch could've cost RR the game,4
Gurkeerat lost it man. All he needs to do is put bat on ball,4

This is more retarded than Rohit sending Shankar ahead of Kartik in Nidadhas,6
Need a Six here from ABD,3
If ABD gets out now it's on Gurkeerat,2
"Even my auto-correct knows ""Gurkeerat"". But Indian commentators can't be bothered to pronounce his name right. Unprofessional nonce.",3
6 needed off this Ball for this over,3
Tactical drop,2
Gurkeerat is going to get his own personal palace in Rajasthan,5
Mann and Unadkat have some kind of deal going,4
Gurkeerat doing a Jadhav here.,3
Four would've been better than three,2
How the fuck did they run three!,5
Tactical drop by Unadkat,5
"Would you rather:

A) Get stuck in Silk Road Junction

B) Watch Gurkeerat bat today?",8
Specialist fielder is good for nothing,2
Don't take the wicket of gurkeerat,3
Retiring out should be normalised,5
How was that running 3,5
dude gurkeerat gifting your wicket would be the biggest contribution u can do rn,7
[deleted],3
RR is the only team that can bottle from here,7
I'm an rcb fan. Ab please leave rcb. You need a team that will bat you at 3. This is an insult.,12
Unadkat is fighting,2
Gurkeerat even holds the bat like a spinner who does't bat,2
RCB dropped Dube for Gurkeerat!! lmao,6
"Previous over...last 2 balls for abd

This over..last ball for abd",6
yo how tf they ran 3 there?,5
Well bowled 👏,2
Gurkareet reminded me Jadhav,2
Kartik Tyagi looks like Rishi Sunak,3
Tyagi 👏👏👏,5
Pure Gold from Tyagi !,2
"Oh no ab on the strike,im scared",2
This Tyagi kid is amazing,2
Unadkat vs abd :(,2
Be happy DRS hasn't ruined the cricket the way VAR has ruined football.,1
Great spell from the man who has sacrificed everything,1
If Koach would have been there it would have been a 4 instead of 3; by running,7
Kohli and padikkal just left it too late.,5
AB is the kid in the group project that's given the toughest slide to present at the very last minute.,10
Unadkat faces Abd!,7
Fuck it I am a Tyagi fan now...,4
This kid has got some talent.,3
Fuck DDP,2
"Archer last over coming up, RCB winning ez

/s?",3
Why is gurkeerat batting higher than Morris when the rr is above 12 already?,2
"RCB gave away 19 & 16 in 2 overs. That's 35 in 2 overs & that's exactly what is needed now.

If Archer does a Morris, it's all over",2
35 from 12 is still doable,2
35 off 2 overs.,1
Why gurkeerat why,1
"For once, I'm hoping Unadkat does a good job.",1
Gand phati padi hai feels like 2016 rcb again,3
"This is embarrassing. Poor team selection once again. Shivam Dube has a great Strike Rate and is playing decently, why would you drop him for Gurkeerat who hasn’t played at all?

And that was a match losing innings from Padikkal. I would have dropped his catch intentionally to secure the match.",5
This is why gurkeerat doesn’t get to bat. Ffs.. he has played 10 percent of RCB innings,5
Padikkal lost the game for us. Dreadful innings today.,4
"Mann 🤝 jadhav

Dot ball specialists",8
Should have sent W Sundar,3
Atleast they should get as close as possible.,1
Archer need to leave 25 runs for unadkat,2
"Unadkat to ABD?

Lol",8
"Gurkeerat, Rishi Dhawan and Barinder Sran played ODIs for India against Australia in 2016.",3
Clown Captaincy,2
RCB should replace Gurkeerat with Dube,5
Shot!,3
Match is over man,2
Just say no to gurkeerat.,3

"19th over by Unadkat, gamble or gambling?",2
Bad Captaincy !!!!!,2
"BIG OVER ALERT.

UNADCUT ALERT

Unadkat to ABD. Game Over. Should have bowled Jofra.,4
Shot!!,3
Oh yeah,3
"Should've bowled archer, brainfade by smudge",2
Yeah this is over,2
Thats it mfs,5
Lol Miller and the other guy on the boundary during tewatia catch - gold,2
It's a crime to give Unadkat 3 dots in the 16.Esp. with ABD at the other end These 3 dots have cost us the chase.,2
Unadkat will end the game in this over,4
"Slow ball, slower six",4
ABD has to do all this by himself. No problem. He will. Fuck it.,7
Why no Jofra?!,2
Undaaaaacaaaattttttttt whhhhoooyyyyy,2
Kohli and Paddikal left too much work at the end.,4
WTF is Smith thinking???,2
Unadkat you beauty 😍,4
I just wanna know if ABD uses some cheat codes while playing....,7
Gurkeerat has been under par for so many years for different franchises. I am amazed he still gets picked,3
Boiiii hell yeahhhhhhh,3
They should have gone with Archer,3
"Unadkat is the Dream11 Game Changer of the Match, not AbD lmao",4
As long as ABD there... there's a chance.,6
Wtf!! I was expecting archer,1
Wtf why not Archer,1
Oh yeah ABD,4
Unadkat will win Rcb a losing match,8
Wait.. Bowling Archer was the most logical move right?,5
Why not Archer???,2
"Unadkut kyun bhaincho

This will cost us.",3
Why was Dube dropped? He’s been playing well,7
"In all seriousness Paddikal’s innings was much worse than Gurkeerat’s.

35(37) when chasing 178 leaves the other batsmen needing almost 11 an over. Game losing innings.",7
"When someone says ""worst players ever in the IPL"", Unadkunt is the first name on my fucking list.",7
Unadkat is one dimension as fuck,0
Why won't you ball archer,2
Dropping Dube for Gurkeerat was really dumb,8
Godamn!!!!?????,3
Should have used Archer. Absolute shit decision to bring Unadkat. 19th over is the most decisive over,3
"Could a ball be more easy than this? Length, no pace, on his leg. Wtf",2
Why not send in Archer and try kill off the game? Poor captaincy,1
"Smith has a greater hunger for loss , can't believe unadkat bowling this one",2
Unadkat you beauty!,2
BRAIN DEAD CAPTAINCY FROM Steve,2
Props to Smith to give 19th to Unadkat to make it interesing.,3
THATS GAME,4
Thats the worst ball you can bowl as a first ball,5
You can't fool ADB with slower balls,5
Classic unadkat,3
Doesn't matter how horrible Unadkat balls. Archer's next and we are screwed.,6
Unadkant back to his real game. Fuck it,3
OMGFG,4
Biggest reason RCB gonna lose this game is Paddikal without question. Your opener can not eat 37 balls and only give you 35 balls. That's horrible.,6
This is the Unadkat we know,7
"Gurkeerat is 30 yo, I thought he was was 21yo youth player RCB had to play",7
Unadkut ffs,3
Unadkat will end the game in this over one way or another,5
EVEEY SINGLE MATCH DEPEND ON AB,10
AB masterclass,6
Unadkunted,3
thanks lord Unadkat :-),2
Prediction: 36 from this over.,1
Monster!!,2
Unadkat for 19th over. Pack up folks!,3
"RR.

Big F for you.",3
Lmao this might be over in this over itself,1
Those 10 wides coming back to bite them in the arse,3
Why no jofra? Ultimate brainfade.,2
ABD stands for Another Big Donger,2
Looks like abd is gonna do it all alone again,3
"Stupid captaincy, Archer should have bowled this over. wtf I can't believe this",3
BRAINFADE CAPTAIN BY SMITH,3
Brett Lee stroking out watching the best of Indian medium pace,3
Ok match over ...poor decision by Smith to give it to unadkat,3
Rcb is back,7
Brainfade captaincy.. Brainfade length balls,6
And Unadkat is back with a bang.,5
This is amazing striking,6
"If ABD wins this, fuck Koach and management. They doing my boy ABD dirty ffs",5
Smith is a shit captain too,5
Can somebody tell me why isn’t Archer bowling this,1
"Guys Just Make Samson the Captain, Smith is kind of retarded this season",2
Brainless bowling. Lollies in his slot.,1
I will totally suck ABD's dick on command no homo,6
There's gotta be a score to defend for archer in the first place ffs,2
Why would you give 19th over to unadkath when you have archer.??,2
Such a slow start and he just comes in and whacks em. What a guy,1
ABD too OP. Please nerf.,5
ABRAHAM BENJAMIN DE VILLIERS,5
RCB and RR fighting over who can make the worse decisions to lose the match,2
Noone jinx anything. Ab's batting,3
HOW MANY TIMES HAS AB DONE THIS FOR US?!?!,3
"Unadkat😂😂😂Sorry rr fans, for laughing on your player, but this is just.....",5
Unadcunt is forever,1

100 km.hr pies in the slot,3
Agent Unadkat reporting for duty,4
Unadkat ruining his all effort in last over.,3
Archer should hve bowled,1
This is what gurkeerat denied us in the last unadkat over trying to be a hero,7
3 dot bolls everyone believed our boi.,8
They sent this man at 6. Unbelievable,5
Unadkat needs to leave at least 12 runs for Archer to defend,2
Archer should've bowled this,2
Why Unadkats and Umeshs never learn.,5
"Smith fucked up, Paine should be relieved",7
19th over is the most decisive over. Why the fuck would you bring Unadkat?,3
Those were two cracking shots from ABD,5
Yes you give to unadkat -.-,4
Fuck! ABD is still better than anybody else around!,7
"Telugu commentator ""Call him 720 not 360""",8

Lol we dreaded it. Damn.,2
Unadcut is so shit man ... every fucking season same story for him,3
No singles please ABD.,3
"And this guy, in this form,  decided to retire just before the World Cup. If I was a south African I might have performed some vodoo curse on him!!",7
Would've been better to bowl a part timer than Unadkat lmao,1
He might’ve hit two 6s but it’s still a big ask,1
Unadkat winning it for RCB.,5
AB going to finish it this over,6
"When a fast bowler is more than 26 and is consistently declining, just toss them away in the auction. They're not at an age when they can easily improve, and there's a steady supply of faster, more fit bowlers in the domestic and U19 level. Applies to Unadkat, Kaul, Sandeep, etc.",5
Moronic from Smith,6
2 careers ending today,6
C'mon AB please take us home.,5
"Unadkat's favorite word must be ""slot""",3
"""What's the plan for Unadkat?""  


""Six!""",8
It should have been archer.,2
One more Six and the match is sealed,3
"I Want AB to finish the match for RCB this innings, he looks dangerous",4
**Jofra Archer or Unadkat Who would you pick?**,4
Do foreign captains talk to their Indian bowlers?,1

AB YOU ABSOLUTE BEAUTY!,5
Imagine not bowling Jofra in the 19th over what the fuck,2
"I feel really really really sad for RR, this is just inviting AB to fuck RR at will",6
Off topic but archer's arm sleeve on one hand looks so fucking cool,4
All aboard the AbD train now. ChuChu Mother******!!,3
"Jaidev ""from 3 dots to 3 sixes"" Unadkat",1
MRRRR 360 BABYYYY,2
I hope RR loses just for giving the 19th over to udnacunt,2
Poor captaincy from Smudge,3
kohli should donate half his salary to ABD if he has some shame left,9
Boys we have a new principal for the Dinda academy!!!,2
RCB don’t deserve ABD,6
What happened to best bowler-19th over theory.,3
Holy moly! Let's fucking gooooo.,2
Unadkat you beauty,4
Ek dum se jazbaat badal diye waqt badal diye,5
"so rcb has 3 problems. Even if AB pulls it off, they cant have him bail them every time

1) The thinktank is making questionable decisions

2) Too many accumulators and not enough big hitters (or big hitters who are out of form like finch). AB only one

3) Pacers are underwhelming aside from morris. Saini doesn't bowl enough yorkers imo. Just see how tyagi is bowling today",3
Smith is not even having a word with Unadkat.He knows it.,5
Warner is a significantly better captain than Smith in IPL. No question about it. None!,3
My boy ABD is gonna make me cry. What an absolute champ he is.,4
Guys guys guys kedar is back,6
Unadkat has lost RR more matches than any single player,3
Unadkat should fake a heart attack,4
"You dafty smudge , should have given the ball to archer",4
The fact I had total faith that AB would do an AB doesn’t make this any less enjoyable,6
Virat with the halo,7
Kohli missing not being at the non striker ends,4
Ab Devilliers is the main character,8
He can't even Bowl a yorker...and he's a millionaire ffs,3
Makes no sense not to bowl Jofra in the 19th. Smith entirely to blame for this loss,3
Thats the game guys,3
Unadcunt man just retire,3
If RCB win this I'd be happy but they totally didn't deserve this with that batting and holding off ABD again,1
Rr fucked it by not putting archer on for the 19th over,1
Lmaoooooo get fucked,2
Jofra is not needed Unadkat will finish it,4
Smith deserved this for his STUPID CAPTAINCY,3
Yo unadkat finally showed up,6
RCB should preserve this guy in a museum.,7
Unadcunt,2
"Koach will suck of ABD after this match,if they win.",3
Unadcunt strikes!!!,2
Why would you not give your best bowler the 18th over to leave them with a bigger target in the last! Smh,3
Gurkeerat are three dot balls against unadkat .,4
"Choose your poison RR fans. 


Archer bowls a 10 run over and Unadkat gets hit for 25 in last.


Or Unadkat bowls a 36 run over and match finishes in 19th over",5
Chutya bowler.,2
AND ITS THREE SIXES!,2
18 fucking overs of good captaincy and you bottle it in the final 2. Only by RR,3
19th over is the most important over in T20 while chasing. Archer should have bowled this.,10
Smith you idiot,1
"Thank You Unadkat, Not Missing Umesh or Siraj today",3
Come on Gurkeerat just one boundary,1
"Kholi biting nails

The pressure /s",3
Why would you not bowl Jofra now you dumbass Smith?,2

Wow Smith it's good ur not captain of aus,3
Unadkat  & Gurkeerat's bookies are out in the carpark fighting each other,3
Poor poor captaincy. Why bowl unadkat when archer is left.,7
Why are dugout commentators not talking about this brainfade captaincy?,5
"Unadkant felt he is a good bowler after 3 dots to gurkeerat, wtf",3
Gurkeerat should just get himself out so Morris can come in.,5
Smith should resign as captain after this,5
single kotbidu saku guru😩,2
Just pick the slow ball please Gurkeerat,2
ABD joining dhoni school of taking it deep.,2
You give the penultimate over to your best bowler : Unadkat?,3
This is more Smith's fault than Unadkat. I mean you knew what you were getting into with bowling Unadkat in the end,4
Everyone in RCB is impostor except ABD,6
ABD CAN DO ANYTHING HE CAN EVEN GET ME A GIRLFRIEND!!,8
"Dumb decision from Smith.


Best bowler of your team should always bowl the penultimate over",5
Smith is a shit captain. Unadkat can't field and can't bowl.,6
If this ball is a dot I swear,4
"Gurkeerat plays a dot, I will dedicate.my life to find him & skin him",2
Y'all celebratating.As if the acting director of the dinda academy will ever dissapoint,2
Theres a reason why people followed 19th over- best bowler strategy,7

Not a hindsight

Always ur best bowler bowls the 19th while defending

U cant win without doing basics right",9
Wow props for Mann to look for the wide. Under the pressure most players would just smack it wide or not,3
Ffs those dream 11 players would bat better than gurkeerat,6
Remove Mann's innings and RCB need 26 from 21,1
Poor captaincy by smith here. Wtf,6
"You can blame Smith for this. It is owners/coach who bought Unadkat for 3 crores are to blame.  Literally, spending money to lose.",11

Steve Smith must be thinking what did I do to deserve this guy as my death bowler :D,6
Yeah even Gurkeerat is hitting this,3
Gurkeerat redemption.,7
Undakat regularly bowls 20 run overs and gets paid crores. He figures that's exactly what his job is. And he's doing it well tonight.,4

No gurkeerat has kept strike,4

Unadkat getting dropped for the season for sure,2
Noooo that one was not worth it ffs,1
"Smith  has no right to be remotely frustrated, your decision mate",8
Lord Unadkat,3
The 19th over is the most important. This should've been Archer's over,5
Gotta feel for unadkat man,1
Tewatia gonna bang Unadkant tonight to teach him lesson,8
Smith mentioned about a brainfade for checking with dressing room if a review has to be taken. This is another such brainfade,4
That’s Unadkat benched for the rest of the season,6
"Unadkat is a moron, if Jof pulls this back last over it'll be a miracle",10
Gurkeerath pls dont fuck it up.,4
Why would you take a single,5
Lol RR deserve this. Bowler has a bad day ofcourse but everyday is a bad day for unadkat.,11
Smith could have bowled himself LOL.,3
Wtf was that. Why the single?,5
Wow unadkat bowled terribly,3
Absolute stupidity by Smith to give the ball to unadkat ..archer has to do magic now to get them.across the line,4
"When the dude who was struggling against the 19 year old smacks you for boundary, you know.",8
Lol abd not on strike.,0
Just give strike to ABD on the first ball itself man.,0
Unadkat - LEFT ARM ORTHODOX,2
The light looked like kohli had a halo over him.,2
"Btw, why I want 5 overseas players in the IPL.  So that garbage like Unadkat will not be making 3 crores while losing games. The only reason he plays is because he's an Indian bowler and not because he's highly skilled.",2
"Ok RCB fans, you have won. Congratulations 👏🏽👏🏽👍🏽AB played well👏🏽👏🏽",2
"Nooooo, Gurkeerat you dork",1
Unadkat the real game changer,2
No fuck not keerat on strike,0
"Poor Unadkat, riding his luck since that fluke season with RPS.",3
We lost this match. Mann on strike with Archer to bowl.,1
Single off the last 😕,3
I will never understand how Dhoni manage to convince everyone Unadkat is worth anything.,2
That single lost RCB the match. Why did you take that single?????,3
To all those shitting on Gurkeerat ... it’s his first game batting and that too under pressure.,3
This guy got 11 freaking crores?,6
my name is jayadev unadkat. please fuck me in the ass,2
Such a waste.,1
Waiting for the Subreddit to bully Jadev Unatkat,4
Hopeless!,2
Gurkeerat retaining strike. Things gonna get spicy.,2
Unadkat is one exception to /r/Cricket's superpowers,4
"Let's go RCB, RCB. King XI fans we happy! Win this!",1
This is definitely death bowling because it's making me want to die,8
Bro please don’t do this to me,1
Even Kedae Jadhav denied a Single but ABD just has to be Mr. Nice guy,3
"BEST RESULT is single off the last ball, unadkat did his job",1
Let Tewetia bowl the last over (if he has any),1
Are u kidding me ? Why take the single ? WHY ?,1
Sack Smith as captain.,2
25 off the 19th. Good job RR.,6
Smudge managed to captain worse than Kohli,2
Jofra vs Gurkeerat. Maiden very much on,1
I mean Gurkeerat is batting for the first time in like 10 months. Of course he was gonna be rusty.,7
"You call it Tewatia, we call it the ABD.",5
Maiden over by Archer incoming,1
Doens't the best bowler usually bowl the 19 th over??,2
Holy shit Unadkat is awful,1
Best bet for RR is for Archer to keep Gurkeerat on strike,1
Upvote if you wonder wtf is wrong with RR that they buy Unadkat for Crores every year,1
Unadkat shouldn’t be allowed to board the bus back to the hotel,3
Unadkat is 360 degree bowler - gives runs to all parts of the ground,2
Unadkat’s best move this over: Let Gurkeerat take a single off the last ball,1
Reminder. Nortje is getting paid 20 Lakhs while Unadkat has been paid 11 Crores and 3 Crores successive seasons,5
If Jofra can defend 10 against a fully set AB De Villiers he’s the best bowler in the tournament,7
 Where can I go for trials and play for RR. I bet I can bowl better than unadkat and I will not even ask for. Millions.,4
RR have thrown away the last 2 games now from massively in charge positions,1
If RCB wins this from here Morris last over will prove to be gamechanger,1
"Bhanchod yar it’s 2020 why is unadkat still
Playing? Why doesn’t he get dropped man??",3
"As long as Gurkeerat doesn't bottle it up, rcb wins it",1
RCB fans can rest easy now. Your team has won👍🏽,2
That is just pathetic. Why would you bowl a slow ball that's so short and so wide? Like what aspect of that ball is going to trouble anyone?,3
Nice of Ab not to deny that single. Good bloke,9
RCB would’ve won here had Kohli made a few better decisions with bowling,2
When i saw udnakat with bowl. I knew rr is gonna lose.,3
Archer has been shafted here,3
Brain dead Smith,0
Undakat is going to sleep like a baby tonight.,1
Unadkat is to RR what Umesh is to RCB,4
LORD Jaydev Unadkat never disappoints,4
Mann needs to take a single and chill the fuck out,1
ABD ABD ABD ABD ABD!!!,1
I mean how the hell is he getting a chance in playing 11. Like seriously how the hell! Cost RR so many matches ffs,1
Can't believe someone paid 8.4Cr once for him. Absolute shit bowling.,3
The single was a bad decision. I have a bad feeling about this.,0
"""It's raining."" - Swann is such a clown lmao.",1
"The commentators said nothing about Archer bowling until 3 sixes had been hit and they all went ‘Oh my god terrible decision it should have been Archer’
A bit of humility please",3
the top 3 spot is kinda fixed now. looks like it won't change.,1
CSK WON THE TOSS AND WON THE MATCH 🙏🏽,1
At least one thing remains constant in 2020. Unadkut. Keeping the rubbish consistent,5
"3 over - 22

1 over - 22

Unadkat 100",6
Archer should have bowled 19th over.. RR lost a match they almost won..,2
Who were the bowling alternatives?,1
"Archer can easily defend 10 in the last lover. 

This is gonna be some finish to the game",2
"lol, Liverpool winner ruled offside by 0.00789 nano meters and now this cunt get cunted.  Goodnight guys.",2
Why not bowl stokes?,1
Honestly tho i dont see RCB winning this season if they depend on abd and kohli,3
"10 is hard to defend, even for Archer in a last over.",5
I’ve never held a cricket ball in my life but I think I can bowl better than Unadkat,5
Whenever a bowler gets hit for a boundary they try a yorker and nail it. Why don't they try it as a default delivery? Yes it can become full toss but even full toss outside off is not that easy to hit.,2
My heart can't handle this shit man,5
gurkeerat please take a single mate,6
"Season in, season out.... same shit from Unadcunt",7
I hope Gurukeerat doesn't fluff this one,6
Drop Unadkat. Get Akash Singh in,1
"Lets see if archer can win this for Rr

Ab's game to loose from here",2
Unadkat... what a money laundering scheme he is,3
"Unadkat in first 3 overs - 21 runs 

last over - 25 runs",4
ABD changing his ~~gloves~~ infinity gauntlet for another infinity gauntlet.,7
"Unad takes what 8-9 crs for one season. Fuckin robbery. This idiot has been playing ipl for 4-5 years or more, domestic cricket for so long , can't even bowl 4 good balls when needed.",2
Even if Archer bowled the 19th over I'm sure Unadcunt wouldn't have defended it,6
Everyone knows that you bowl the best bowler in the 19th,2
Can Archer do a Morris here?,3
Inb4 5 fiery yorkers,3
You shouldn't be losing when opposition needs 35 off 12 man.,3
"ABD be like:

Ka kiye??? ...kooot diye .spiye aafice mein baap ke samne.",2
[deleted],3
"Bumrah bowls the 19th, everyone bowls their best bowler in the 19th. Shouldn't have gone to Unadkat",10
RR's best bet would be denying AB strike,3
Unadkat is a glorified bowling machine. He has no variations other than pace.,4
"Bruh imagine a super over, just imagine",2
That was hit nice actually.,2
If only Lord didn't generously give away those wides,3
shouldve sacrificed gurkeerat,3
"Smith: ""What was that mate? Absolute rubbish""  
Unadkat: ""Sorry skip, my name's not Jofra"".",4
Yeh matches sab fixed hai /s,6
What the fuck is wrong with Rajasthan Royals management/captaincy. Should have given 19th to archer and we would have won.,3
"Wtf man, why a double",3
Smudge you fucking idiot,5
Congo RCB for the win👏🏽👏🏽,2
NO!,5
"Dread it,run from it,Lord Unadkat still arrives.",8
finch vaping haha,9
They run 2 now lmao,3
[deleted],11
Give ABD strike man,2
"Lmao unadkat needs an academy on his name, he now has transcended into next level from dinda",2
"Gurkeerat played 3 dots of Unadkat with AbD chilling at other end


Remember that",2
Bc ab archer se yorker na dal rhe,3
Why why why why,1
"I dont blame unadkat, I blame Smith. Unadkat is as shit as they come and he still gave the bowl to him",3
lmao finch vaping,5
"After all the thrasing Undakat recieves, season after season, how the hell is he getting picked up for crores.",3
New principal of the Dinda academy has been crowned!!! Lord Unadcunt take a bow..that was Lord Tewatia in reverse.,2
Finch is vaping? Holy crap,6
Appreciate the confidence from gurkeerat lol,3
RCB gonna give heart attack to fans after all these years,2
Finch smoking back there... Lol,8
Unadkat: Form is temporary but conceding runs is permanent.,12
Ab is too nice for his own good,8
Ab is no dhoni. He trusts the other batsman to finish the innings,8
If RR bid for Unadkat again next year I'm gonna lose it.,6
Did Finch just have a vape??? Or am I going insane,22
Match not over yet,3
[deleted],12
**Unadkat might be shit but this much holy shit**,5
Was finch vaping??,4
Wtf. Why would you run two. Abd should be like Dhoni sometimes,3
"Poor captaincy aure but fuck me that doesn't excuse Unadkat, never an excuse to go for 25 in an over",5
Imagine ABD gets out here,2
"Tyagi had 1 and archer had 1 this is puerly captains mistake.

If dk done this ,r/cricket would have asked for his head.",4
 Bro was Finchy vaping,4
"I'm gonna cry now, this feels bad for any team, ultimate brain dead strategy to let unadkant fuck 19th over",8
Is finch vaping?,1
"Finchy hitting the fucking Vape, what a boy hahahahaha",9
"LMAO, finchy with e-cigarette",6
Was finch vaping?,5
Finch with the vape hahahaah,5
Common ABD finish this off.,2
next two balls decide the game,3
"Smith and Koach had a gentleman's agreement before the match. I'll play Unadkat, if you play Siraj. Koach backed out at the last moment.",2
Finch smoking a Juul??,2
Well done gurkeerat,4
Unadkat is the single worst bowler to have played the IPL for so long. For the price it looks even worse.,5
[deleted],5
Did I just see Finch vaping ?,10
"So last tiny winy hope for playoffs goes sssss....

When you got hit around for back to back sixes in such a ground...",2
Gurkeerat could become a hero right here,1
Was finchy vaping ?!!,3
RCB benefiting from a but of luck in the middle overs to capitalise on some poor bowling at the end.,1
Finchy on the vape has made my day,12
Wonderful from ABD to let Gurkeerat be on strike last over and also take a double first ball,2
Finch vaping??? Lmao,9
Meanwhile Kohli is experiencing a euphoria.,5
"Come on archer, 1 wicket.",3
Kohli me peeche kya hai,3
Finch: screw this shit I’m gonna vape,4
Man I missed Finch vaping,2
Why is Stokes fielding if he is injured?!?,3

Come on AB. Smack it please,6
[deleted],1
Please get ABd out here,2
Beamer incoming!!,2
Anyone else feel Stokes looks like a fielding liability? He is struggling,3
Is Stokes injured? If so why hasn't he been subbed off?,5
ABD and Koach to open the batting next match. Fuck the middle order,7
Lol... 5 sixes 1 four....Jesus...he is not human.,12
This is Devillier's world and we're all side characters,8
Why the fuck do you field Stokes when he isn't fit ?,2
" I am ready for a super over

Edit: NVM",5
lmao kohli is getting hyper,4
Man stokes struggling there :(,1
Stokes needs to go rest,2
Surely vaping isn't good for a sportsman?,10
Finch caught smoking..wtf,9
Let's bulldoze Dinda Academy and build Unadkat School of Waste Disposal.,4
Why is Stokes on the field. He is not a 100%,2
[removed],2
How South Africa would wish ABD would come back.,9
*whispers: super over*,0
"I never seen so many people hate Kohli when ABD does well 😂

Like be fucking happy for the player doing well.",11
lmaoaa get fucked,3
Stokes at long-on with his injury? What?,1
YESSSSSSS,2
"""that 25 off the 19th was huge""

ABD you god,7
No one is surprised lol,6
I love you man!,7
Lol they actually won....!!!!,7

Just how many times will one player win it for RCB. Sigh.,7

King AB,6
Orgasmic,4
"3rd Match winnin knock from ABD, off to Chennai Delhi thread now",4
Thanks Unadkat,4
"Right come on Archer, don't be a pussy. Beamer to take out AB, before yorkers for the rest of the over",8
Why the fuck is Ben Stokes fielding when he is injured and limping?,4
Thank you! Good night!,5
Ab is a literal god!!!,7
Thankyou Undakat 🙏🙏,2

"A wonderful match-winning innings from Gurkeerat, well supported by De Villiers.",5
Pls nerf AB,2
Unadkat HAHAHAHAHHAHAAH,3
EASY WIN,1
RR did a KXIP today,3
I still can’t believe what RCB did last game,3
Such a stunning victory! ABD FOREVER!!!!!,5
That's why ABD is the goat of RCB.,6

Wow just wow . AB HYATSSS APPP,5
"east or west

Unadkat is a retard.",19
Why would you bowl in his slot? Bc you are the choosen one who used to nail 6 yorkers.,7
Where the fuck did that sub come from so fast,7
Time for unadkat to go,5
Yeah love to see ABD not choking,12
AbD singlehandedly powering RCB to a victory.,12
That was the most pumped up celebration I have seen from ABD.,14
Shithouse captaincy from Smith.,7
Unadkat - Dream XI game changer of the match,12
ABD IS A FUCKING GOD HOLY SHIT,11
Abd you absolute legend,9
I love you Abraham Benjamin Devilliers.. ❤️,11

We don't deserve you AB 🙁 Champion stuff!! 👏👏,14
"Unadcunt fucked it all, all 3 SLOWER balls to AB ffs",16
Whew!,7
"Okay how stupid was RCB's decision last match to demote AB, *twice*?",23
Holy shit unadcunt thank you so much,13

How to throw a game - join RR school of assfuckery,5
KKR unclench their assholes.,3
Terrible captaincy from Smith tbh. Why would you save Unadkat of all people for the death. He's lost so many game for RR at the death.,6
"ABD is a god

Unadkat is the imposter,1

ABD O palan haare nirgun O nyare,4
Yo I am so happy guys :D weekend made. Now time to take gf out and spend some good time. Hehe,3
Hot damn! Finishing six by ABD and Fabio pole!!  Good feels!!,4
Unadkat won you the game rcb fellas. MOM to him,2
Rajasthan doing a kings 11 there. 2 overs 35 should be defended.,3
Last 2 over were disaster.  Stokes at the most important fielding position? Fuck me,4
This was our last hope for the season :(,3
ABD what a legend.,10
Lord Tewatia all your heroics go in vain,4
and he has done it with a little help from his friend... in pink ;),5
"that’s why you bat him 4, don’t know what we were doing",5
RR are masters at grasping defeat from the jaws of victory,4
Smith's 6D chess moves are so stupid that it isn't even funny anymore. Why would u bowl Unadkat at ABD in the 19th!! Even keyboard warriors know better,10
"Abd is love, Abd is life",7
ABD you god.,7

"Apath Bandhava De Villiers
T:Savior",10
Chutiya jaydevvv,2
Unadkat the game changer of the match.,7
Smith should be stripped off the captaincy for that,6
RR deserved to lose just for that god awful captaincy decision of bowling fucking Unadkat in the 19th when they have Archer,16
Unadkat ki maa ka bhosda,4
[deleted],5
Even 19 year old tyagi is far far better than unadcunt,14
South Africans saving RCBs ass.,13
Anushka looks super happy.,6
If ABD's back doesn't break carrying a team with finch in it. He has the strongest back,25
ABD you fucking beauty!,7
He really is the most talented batsman of all time isn't he?,11
This is why you don't bat AB at 4 bitches. He has won this almost single handedly,12
AB.... JUST AB..,5
Tewatia is going to kill Unadkat now.,10

ABD statue coming up near Cubbon Park,10
"When are we naming a street or circle after AB here in Bangalore? Also, Kohli and AB hugging is exactly what we need in 2020.",14
Friendly reminder that it's been over 2 years since ABD retired from International cricket.,9
Archer and Unadkat both are equally shit,1
"Shambolic captaincy from Smith. Screwed up the batting order, screwed up the death bowling. Unadkat should've been bowled out before the 15th. 2 from Archer, 2 from Tyagi in the death, with Archer in the 19th.",9
Hmm should have sent ABD at no.6,5
AB please take my house and flat in Bangalore. I will start a petition to re-name fucking MG Road after you.,13
AB DE VILLIERS IS A PRIVILEGE,17
Agent unadkat from rcb bois,8
Thrown that RR. RCB lucky that those catches and run outs earlier went their way. Shouldn't have got near that total,3
"RCB need 60 from 26 balls and AB de Villiers was 8*(9) then 6,0,6,2,4,1,1,6,6,6,1,2,6 and took the team into victory.",11
I feel for RR supporters. dogshit captaincy from Smith.,2
GOAT,12
RR is out of the tournament and I think thats best of everyone,6
RCB gained another 100K fans after these last 15 minutes,13
"Both lived up to their expectations and did what do they do best, I meant ABD and Unadkunt.",8
The difference between rcb and rr is that rcb benched umesh and unadkat is still playing,5
"Please get parthiv to open, throw Finch out and maybe get in moeen for gurkeerat",3
"The Royals ability to lose a game from any situation is incredible.

Smith fucking bottled the captaincy big time there",4
"Pfft. Stupid fucking game

/s",3
"If RCB has to retain only one player next season, it should be ABD",16
Anushka was giving batting practice to Gurkeet,4
ABD..ABD..ABD!! Oh how I wish this was in chinnaswamy..,9
Unadkat should retire from cricket for this performance,3
This defeat feels worse than the Delhi one. We could have been in top 4 but now a prime candidate to challenge Kings for last spot. **WE ARE THE NEW CHOKERS**.,3
Madarxhoddddddďdd,4
Man now we have to beat CSK to keep the table alive.,3
MF we could have won the last game atleast if abd came after sunder was out. Brain dead hesson.,5
"RR have shot themselves in the foot with a 6 foot ,8Cr gun",9
"Dream 11 game changer of the match
ALTROZ Super Striker",4
How much did RR buy Unadkat for?,2
ABD is too OP that he did this despite Padikkal and Gurkeerat's awful innings.,15
How does Unadkat keeps getting picked each IPL?,6
He did it again! Superman saved the day.,13
"Unadkat - Things change, being shit is constant",5
"Now that ABD bashed Jofra as well can the unadkat hate train stop, he bowled wonderfully for his first 3 overs. It’s not exactly easy to bowl to AB fucking deVilliers. I agree jofra should have had the 19th, but the way the 20th went, I imagine jofra would prolly have gone for 15-20 himself.",18
"Say, Virat?! That's how you get a 50. Yours sincerely, AB.",28
Time for RR to end the aussie love fest and dump Smith as captain for good. Choosing unadkat over archer for the 19th over should be a sackeble offense.,4
Fuck this shit fuck this team,10
Fucking hell how did we win this lmfaooo,23
Archer deserves a MUCH better team,16
De Villiers doing a Tewatia,5
"Well done RCB. Gotta feel bad for Gurkeerat, he tried really hard for RR.",9

Man this tailender could sure hit some shots.,6
GOAT,7
Time to shit post on the other thread,7
Thanks a lot Jaydev and a special thanks to Smith !,8
This win makes me feel great We were down and out and have won from a really precarious position.So happy.Good game lads,10

Its just the fourth spot in the table up for grabs. Three teams look set to qualify,2
Just another day where AB saves our ass,20
Anushka wondering why she didn't marry ABD,11
"RR has the worst bowling attack in IPL. Literally a single international tier bowler (Archer). Not even a single India regular.

No wonder we keep getting our ass kicked when defending",7
"This is EXACTLY why you DON'T send ABD inside first 6 overs when two wickets fall early. 

He can do absolute carnage at the end. 

You commentator muppets.",9
"Like I said, ABD pulled an ABD.",10
"AB being AB

Unadkat being Unadkat

No excuse there.",6

Not to excuse those last two overs but lets not forget that AB is a fucking freak and if he feels like hitting sixes then he's going to cunt some goddamn sixes regardless of who's bowling,14
"Out of words for abd. 
What a legend",10
Hitting sixes against even Archer. Complete sublime performance. Can't really fault Javdev as well.,14
Smith should be asked tough questions today about that 19th over,3
Unadkat in the 19th over was suicide,5
god bless unadkat. so consistent. true legend.,4
ABD!! But also TYAAAGII! Keep your head high!,10
"What an innings! ABd is a legit freak!

A bit of a brain dead captaincy to not give Archer the ball for the 19th over. Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh on Stevie.",9

"Two things:-  
a) Virat is playing far too slowly. Let's not mistake earth shattering fitness for batting prowess cause if that was true then 2015-19 Thala would be the greatest T20 batsman in history  
b) You can AFFORD to take questionable decisions if you have ABD in your side. The man is a cheatcode. Putting Undakat up against him is like putting up a goat against a tiger, there was no fair fight",23

Gosh. ABD would have won the previous match also. I hope they will never make that shit decision again,11

What a match. ABD GOAT,8

"And their own management thought this guy can't handle few leggies ??

Were they high ?",16
Should’ve bowled archer in the 19th. Not that even 25 would’ve been enough for Unadkat for AB in this form,8
"Why did I pick the most utterly infuriating fucking team to support? Should be on 5 wins, but absolutely bottled 2 in a row. 

The 3 runs off the last over, the absolutely shit fielding, 13 extras is absolutely terrible. Giving Unadkat the 19th instead of Jof....

If even one of those is improved on they probably win the game.",11
Why would Gurkeerat come before morris. RCB not winning this year IPL which such weird decisions,6
AB is better than the Fab4. QED,27
Ik these are international cricketers who have done wonders for their sides for years but then how the fuck do they make these stupid blunders which even a couch expert like me can see.,3

Poor captaincy. With 35 needed of 12 should have given the bowling to your best bowler Jofra. Always give the 19th over to your best bowler in a tight chase. That way atleast there is a chance of a tight over thereby the burden of chasing a lot of runs in the last over might get to the batsmen.,17

"Unadkat not only let his team down, but also removed some spice from the rest of the tournament.. Now, just one position for playoffs is up for grabs with KKR, SRH, CSK fighting for it :/",14
The only reason Unadkat should be playing for RR is if he's captaining the squad. No way would he have let himself bowl the 19th over Archer. Horrendous decision by Smith.,7

Lol AB scored his last 47 off 13 balls,36
"It is the the most obvious thing in the world that ABD, no matter the match ups or situation, can win a game single handedly if he is set.",15
Imagine what would have done last match if they would have sent ABD up the order. Brain dead captaincy.,6
I hope RCB learns how to hit sixes from ABD,18
de Villers justified his promotion to number 4 today. Maybe he'll get a chance to bat regularly at 4 in the future.,34

AB always Delivers!,20
Unadkat should retire man.,2
"Ok..now what is the purpose of Unadkat in IPL? He is Vinay Kumar 2.0, who just spams slower deliveries without any thought.

For years he has been an average bowler, who can't keep his economy under 10 if his life depended on it.",5
What a brilliant game changer this guy is lucky that we could witness his four over spells. Jaydev Unadkat take a bow champ,11

Neroli Meadows👍🏽,4
Thanks RCB for keeping our hopes alive! (Punjab fan).,17
"I don’t think the decision to bowl Unadkat in the 19th was that bad. If he bowled Archer and Archer went for 16, you’ve then got Unadkat bowling the last over to the small boundary defending 20 against ABD. 
Definitely not as bad a decision as you guys are making out",34
"Kohli  last match: I'm going to make AB bat 6 

Smith : I'm gonna one up you and make Unadkat bowl the 19th instead of Archer",48

This is a normal abd innings but becomes special as chasing hasn't been easy this year,22
If RCB had any shame they'd rename themselves to ABD,44
"RCB won due to team effort of Kohli, ABD, Morris and Unadkat",42
"Happy with the win but fuck me there are so many cracks and red flags here. Only Morris, Chahal and AB deserve to hold their heads high. Everyone else has been disappointing. Can’t expect AB to score 50 from 20 every game. Kohli needs to check his approach to these games. Tuk tuk will one day cost us a win. It already did against Punjab. Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals won’t be so forgiving",38
Another brain fade for Smith. Haha,16
Appreciate gurkeerat for not losing himself even though he missed a few balls,36
I swear these social distancing interviews are better than usual. Both parties seem less awkward.,5
"Why didn't we go for Archer in the 19th over? I reckon he would've got a wicket  along with conceding under 15 runs, meaning that Unadkat in the 20th over would've been bowling to batsmen under higher pressure",6
genius Genius GENIUS AB! ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE GUY. WHAT A LEGEND.,10
"AbD is welcome to become the mayor of Bangalore once he retires from IPL. Heck, make him the chief minister of Karnataka while you are at it for all his contribution to Rcb.",34
RR blew this match RCB style. Turntables,12
Why does rcb use udana when they have steyn?,3
"The problem isn't Unadkat bowling, the problem is when he bowled. Archer should have been given the 19th, there was no other way to proceed",4
"I envy RCB for Koach and ABD, god damn what a  finish",14
I'm moving on to DC,7
Missed match how did rr lose?,2
"I feel like Kohli needs to try for bigger sixes, can't afford to get caught",16
"this game finished a  lot earlier than previous matches, teams must have been told to watch their overrates",4
RR should have won.,5
"My theory is Unadkat gets very tired at the end of the innings, this is why he bowl slow so much. Not because it's his strength or whatever. Why he went super shit that over because he had to run all the ground right before the over after that attempted catch.",4
Behen ke laudeeeeeeeeeeeee,8
"We don't deserve ABD. Mumbai, please buy the man next auction and save him some grief",22
"Remember. Paddikal, not Kohli, was the one who shitted on the run chase.",21
"I've been told off by my wife for cursing Jaydev Unadkat's entire family because it's Navratri. 

I'll do it again. Fuck this thief. A clown of the highest bloody order. Why we persist with this imbecile is beyond any reasonable person's understanding.",1
Finch vaping has to be the highlight of the match for me,22
Smith getting scared after hearing a free hit siren while batting makes you feel like he's still carrying sandpaper in his pocket lol,27
"God when this game is good it's good. I love sport. No sport in the world leaves me the same feeling of adrenalin and relief in a regular league game than this sport. Physically shaking after that tense finish. So good!

&#x200B;

I. Love. This. Game.",29
"Feeling bad for Unadkat. Unplayable in domestic cricket, new hope before every year but can't cut it at the highest level. Wrong place wrong time. Smith threw him under the bus against AB there and now he has to deal with all the abuses and criticisms on social media.",27
"Making fun is one thing, but abusing a player for performing badly is not done. It's not like Unadkat is enjoying being carted around the ground. Moreover, it's ABD in great form. This was always on the cards.",30
The word genius really really suits AB. What a legend,24
Neroli's laugh is something😳😅,3
Abd today is what fans imagine dhoni to be,105
Who is that lady supporting RCB in the stands? Seems like a co-owner or something,7
Who are the batsmen you’d bank on to win 35 from 12? Other than ABD?,19
"**IPL2020 in death overs (16-20) so far**

Most runs scored : AB de Villiers (209)

Most 6s : AB de Villiers (18)",31
everybody forgot how good Tyagi bowled thanks to AB and Unadkat,16
Gonna have to wait for the full match to be uploaded on Hotstar to see Finch vaping,16
Thr leg side boundary was on longer side in 19th over. So Smith had to no option other than giving the ball to Unadkat.,10
RCB should just dissolve their team after ABD'S retirement.,64
"Respect to Unadkat but that first ball of 19th over, dude was seriously challenging AB to hit as big as he can",18
"One thing I've never understood is how everybody here is on the 5th stage of grief when it comes to bowling departments. Everyone has accepted how shit their team's is (barring a few). Khaleel, Unadkat, yada yada. Are there seriously no better Indian options in the auction?",11
i hope we dont lose ab next year cause kohli asks for 20 cr,13
"Commentator to Morris: Are you tired of watching AB keeping doing what he does?  

WTF bro?? Who gets tired of legends doing what legends do?",12
"This would have been an easy chase if some cricketers had come on the field with the intent of scoring quick runs, rather than showcasing their fitness level to promote vegan diet.",11
"A tip to all sides.

Fill your sides with 6 leg spinners only that can keep abd in the pavilion.",17
Cant imagine what being in that dressing room be like for unadakat. Poor guy,19
Unadkat is literally a money laundering scheme. I mean who would in their sane minds pay that amount for a player like him.,37
[removed],-18
"What would be the general cricket fans reaction in SA if ABD plays 2021 T20 world cup? I know the shady politics on CSA front, but would an average fan welcome his return with cheers or do they still feel he betrayed them by retiring before 2019 WC.",10
RCB was truly desperate to send Abd in 4,31
"**Jaydev Unadkat conceding 40+ runs in an IPL innings**

2019: Five times

2020: Two times (5 games left) can he beat himself?",26
"Unadkat needs someone to tell him he can bowl yorkers, it didn't look like he was trying. He doesn't have the pace to make slower balls slower, if your slower ball is 10Ks slower its not actually slow. Then you get this under confident average death bowler against the current best hitter, obviously he makes 50 out of 20.",3
"I know I said I was a neutral but it's hard to not root for the SA players when you see how well they're doing. Anna, Faf, AB, KG, Morris and Quinny are all doing well so far. I'm happy",53
The fact that RCB lost just 3 wickets but ABD had to do they heavy lifting tells a lot.....,55
"Credit to Gurkereet too, he held his nerve.",14
Inb4 Robin Uthappa is gonna have a fallout with Steve Smith like he had with DK,10
47 in his last 13 balls the man is not human,31
"Hey RR fand, If it feels any better, Umesh gave away 26 runs to dhoni when they needed 28 off last over.",19
"Changed the flair from RR to DC. RR don't deserve fans. Fuck this.
Go DC.",-8
i feel like any praise i give to AB isnt enough dude is beyond anything oof man,37
ABD is what MSD fans think MSD is 😂,58
All of us blaming smithy for 19th over has too much confidence in 20th over Unadkat,13
I wish someone would blindly back me in life the way Rajasthan Royals back Unadkat!,13
Each and every one of Unadkat's shitty slower balls deserve to be smashed for six tbh,10
I love only one God and that's ABD,20
"It's not Unadkat to blame, he was playing as usual. It's Smith captaincy, rahane would never make such ones",13
"Probable reason why Unadkat was given penultimate over was because his bowling figures were really good in the match today. Going by how things looked it was difficult to bat, Smith would have considered getting his over through . No one expected that innings but ABD..",10
"Finchy let out a MASSIVE cloud of vape smoke at 19.1 overs in the chase. What a champion 😄 Finchy mate where are you getting your nicotine liquid from, VaporEyesNZ? Join us at r/aussievapers, we'll hook you up 💨💨",19
"Some of these are a part of a special league of bowlers, who can single handedly lose you matches, Siraj, Unadkat et al",10

Was Finch vaping in the dressing room?,14
"A legend like ABD has been massively unlucky. 

Retired early from internationals because  the cricket board was screwing him over and now being mismanaged at RCB :(

"I dunno why some people think Kohli should have scored faster. He was stiriking at 135 and got out to a shot that was almost a six.

It was Padilkkal and Gurkeerat's innings that ABD has to offset. Even if they scored at 125 SR, ABD and RCB had to score 15 less runs in the same deliveries.",32
"The worst part about this win is that Kohli will think that his approach worked and continue to put pressure on AB by playing defensive cricket. First of all he needs to drop Finch or Paddikal. One is completely unreliable and the other plays like a test batsman. Bring back Moeen Ali, Parthiv Patel and Shivam Dube. This team needs firepower. It’s not balanced at all",18

"Again the problem with rcb continues,  all batting responsibilities on kohli and abd",25
Jadhav is back guys....,12
It is easy to criticize now but the idea behind giving Unadkat the 19th over was to let him use the long boundaries from that end against ABD. There's not much you can do when ABD is on strike,29

Gurkeerat was just in a 77 run partnership,43

Guy has talent sure but he cannot play under pressure",17
"Even if Jofra had bowled the penultimate over, would it have made a difference though? ABD was on his shit tonight !
Hope RCB play him higher. No.6 for the Genius is a disgrace !!",31
"I think we really need to tone down the abuse for players irrespective of sides.I know for a fact Kohli would have been abused while he was building his innings but it turned out to be a pretty decent one on such a slow track.Same with Unadkat, he had 3 good overs before that. Sometimes, these match threads seem like fucking Facebook and Twitter. Reddit is a much better place. 

Some people want Kohli released FFS😂.Do realize that  while you are chilling at home passing comments, these guys have actually worked very hard to get to where they are.

Constructive criticism is good but abusing players while sitting on the couch  back home? Nah!",83
You know what's worse than watching jadhav bat? Watching it right after what AB just did.,81
JD deserves abuse. Constantly taking crores yet this shitty performance. He is scamming the team,10
Why is Unadkat?,19

Abd being a bro and ensuring gurkeerat doesn't get scapegoated tonight",73
I missed the match. Is there anywhere I can go to watch it again?,12
"Just wondering, I missed the last 5 overs but based on the 6's highlights the death bowling didn't look terrible, was this just ab pulling off a miracle?",28
You can't expect much from any bowler if batsman is abd ffs. It's not like jadhav pulled tewatia during unadkat's last over. I hope RR gets better bowler next season. Whole team seems dependent upon archer. Tyagi seems promising tho.  Uthappa and Smith being in form is good for team overall. Feels bad for Samson tho. Guy has been performing same since he started for RR when he was 18. Hope things turn around for his career.,20
"I don't really understand people trolling padikkal and kohli, padikkal is just 20 and it is his first season and yes last few matches he was slow, but not everyone is perfect when they start their career. Rcb's first solid opener in years other than kohli tbh. And kohli had to play slow because he can't afford to lose his wicket before 10 overs considering the middle order issues",66
"I honestly think the Tewatia over was worse than then Undadkat one. Leaking so many free runs, versus taking on ABD and getting hit for 6. Credit to AB more than fault on Undadkat",12
Unadkat is too predictable,22

I get what Smith was saying with the longer boundary protecting Unadkat and his slower stuff could come off. But he was forgetting that ABD was on the other that can clear any ground and you just can’t rely upon Unadkat at the death. Even if Jofra gave away 15/16 that would’ve been 20 to defend with a lot more pressure on AB,22
Unadkat is that guy jisko sirf two buttons malum Cricket 07 pe 1.slow ball 2.slow ball,14
"With Morris' inclusion in the team,The team looks solid and is extremely good now!!

Consistent good performances with the bat and bowl,got a 140 to 170 in last match and also gts consistent wickets per match,he is underrated in Ipl!!

Today:4/26 in 4",20
Man I tuned in after the Merseyside derby and wow that was one of the worst penultimate overs I've ever seen in cricket. 35req off 12 and didn't even get close to defending it. Awful inexcusable bowling.,21
"Why tf do RR keep buying Unadkat every season? A travesty like him should not even be bought, let alone buying him for huge sums like what RR do. They brought this on themselves. Rajasthan's ranji team has better bowlers than Unadkat in Deepak Chahar & Khaleel Ahmed.",19
