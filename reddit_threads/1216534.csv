"Siraj, Manish, 3D, Narine, Rana. Who's going to have comeback this match?

My picks - Maxwell, Warner ( I know warner scored runs, but those innings are not upto his standard )",4
Maxwell Century to win this one for KXIP,1
Chris Gayle will hit a century,12
[removed],2
This is probably the first time with so many dead rubbers.,-4
KXIP in red hot form,4
People who are saying KKR will almost confirm their spot in top 4 if they win today. They'll still need to win 2 of their next 3 matches otherwise KXIP or SRH can reach 14 and beat them by NRR.,8
"Just got news that Mandeep's dad passed away in the morning after battling death out for almost a week

Lost a cousin couple weeks ago and now this, was advocating for him to play over Hooda but now I just hope he is somehow coping while being so far away from his family

Was a great jolly person, always encouraged him to do better. RIP.

E: i dont think the news is reported to any news publishers yet so please respect that if this you are talking about it on twitter or anything üôè",75
Hoping for a big Kings XI win so we can recover our NRR too,7
"Dang, I don't have much confidence in defending a score",7
"Oh man. Why Khaleel again!

They should have gone for Abhishek.",2
Waiting for Gayle storm...,2
Fuck DC,5
No Mayank. Fuck my life.,2
"Damn DC, not the loss but the magnitude makes this match not so exciting",1
DC BC,1
Mayank dropped? Or injured?,9
Kanos injury still?,3
Hopefully this game brings me more joy than the previous one today.,1
Is kane still injured??,1
No Mayank :(,1
Wtf why Mayank is not playing :(,1
"King Deepak Hooda facing his old side today. 

He has spent many hours facing them in the nets and will surely hit a glorious century including many sixes off Rashid Khan.",6
Gayle storm?,3
Let's see if Punjab can win without Mayank,3
"Fudge, Mayank's injured?",3
SRHü§ùKXIP Being upset at DC today,6
Why did we drop neesh. Our batting is incredibly shallow. Also when was the last time we won a toss. Literally lost the toss the last 5 or 6 times,5
I feel Kohli‚Äôs RTG was actually invented by Kumble.,8
can KXIP really only bat until 6. Here I was thinking our depth was bad,5
Why not play Neesham over Jordan if Mayank is injured. Increases batting depth. Then again Jordan's been playing solid his last 2 games,6
Seems like a lot of people really want KIXP for the 4th spot,57
Cmon Punjab!!,3
"Not only did Pooran run Mayank out, he injured him in the process as well. You better score a century to make up for it",11
"Me jumping from the kkr vs dc match thread to this one

Parkour!",41
Not confident at all. 4 Batsmen (Maxwell and hooda don't count) way too many bowlers for no fucking reason especially when Maxwell bowls 4 overs. What the fuck did neesham do to get dropped you fucking buffoons? Literally hit a 6 to win the last game.,6
"As CSK is out, I'm channeling my 100% reverse jinx power for SRH.",6
Neesham dropped for no reason,5
Let‚Äôs gooooooooo KXIP!!!!!!!!,6
"KKR's run rate is still pretty bad compared to  KXIP or SRH, if CSK decides to play spoilsport for them it could be the game that decides who gets 4th place between these two",7
Don't care who wins but want a close and even contest.,2
[deleted],81
"I only watch the meme team for Mayank, and he's not even playing smh",2
Neesham dropped for not taking it to the super over.,32
Why was Neesham dropped?,3
"KIXP,  SRH aren't a top shelf team, so no need to bring out your giant killing form please.",6
SRH and KXIP 's runrate still better than KKR,6
Why is Mayank not playing?,1
"Gayle vs Rashid !!!

Also would love to see gayle demolish the srh bowlers",5
[deleted],5
"SRH playing Khaleel and KXIP playing Jordan

Balanced as all things should be.",6
"If there's a collapse/situation where we need another bat and neesham would have been more useful I'm never forgiving these shit holes. Fucking morons are taking 5 specialist bowlers, which moronic team in the history of t20 cricket has taken 5 specialist bowlers btw?",2
KXIP have got both Universe Boss Gayle and Milky Way Boss Shami,13
"Someone get lottery tickets from Maxwell

Dude gets picked everytime through the RTG",3
Why am I reading every Mayank as Mayanti,8
Gayle storm pls,5
"Lesson learnt today: True Delhi fans don't count on Delhi to win, why would you?",6
"Yay no mayank, That's a bonus bois",5
"Based on NRR, I guess us KKR supporters should be supporting KXIP, right?",3
Punjab has to win today's and Monday's match against KKR to get 4th position.,4
Is this dead rubber?,1
Gayle should open with Rahul and Mandeep at 3. No experiments required here.,5
"It's gonna take pretty much every match to go exactly the right way from here on out in order for one of these two to qualify

It's a shame cause KXIP have looked fantastic these last few games and definitely could compete for the title if they did make top 4",7
Kkr fans hope that this match gets washed away,8
KL Rahul and David Warner after the toss be like ‚ÄúFuck Delhi Capitals‚Äù,20
"Damn, race for the 4th place gonna be so interesting",4
[deleted],-8
How many matches will our Goat Mayank miss?,1
"Rahul's strike rate has to be up to scratch today, even if Gayle is his partner. And Pooran better continue the good work!",0
KKR's NRR went from -877 to -476. Ours (Kings XI) is at -177 so we're still in this race for 4th seed granted we win out.,5
Who will win? Universe Boss or one 3D boi,7
"SRH looks sort of balanced on paper now given that Pandey and Vijay can taken confidence from their knocks last game. Good to see Khaleel back in. Also, how good is Holder the batsman?",7
"With Mayank out, Rahul will go back to tuk tuk",7
[deleted],2
Mayank should be available for the next game according to Cricinfo,7
I am predicting Gayle to get out to one of Khaleel's trash delivery. It's the Khaleel special,19
Is Mayank injured?,6
[deleted],10
"If Khaleel is brought back into the team because of the problem in the death, I'm laughing.",2
Why are they not playing Sarfaraz?,0
I'm honestly surprised they don't have a coin toss sponsor,23
"After KKR's win v DC, Top 4 almost decided or these two teams are still in the race for 4th spot?",2
[deleted],3
F1 quali got delayed. It's gonna affect my plan of watching KXIP's beginning innings. Anyone else in a similar situation?,2
"KXIP still have a chance. Win today, win against KKR on Monday and it is a 2 game shootout to determine who gets 4th. KXIP have better NRR too.",2
It doesn‚Äôt matter who wins RCB for life,4
Who's in for Neesham ?,2
Ffs doesn't Gayle have a horrible record vs Rashid as well. I'm out fuck off,6
Kane still not playing today :(,5
"Maybe it was the beard. Varun Chakravarthy now has a full beard like Kohli. In the 2018 season, he had a beard like Unadkat.",9
I'm so worried to see our medium pacers going against Gayle.,9
"Opinion: they should remove game changer award to best catch one, most times the man of the match gets the most fantasy points, atleast good fielding should be appreciated",5
WTF why ain't Gayle opening brain-dead management,7
"Where is my probability guy

I need answers",6
Is it possible that we win all our remaining matches and still not qualify?,2
Hope Mandeep does well ‚ô•Ô∏è,11
Why open with Mandeep when you have Gayle idiots??,3
"Why on earth are they not opening with Gayle. Especially considering what Mandeep‚Äôs going through, RIP.",18
I really hope we haven't dropped Kane. Surely he comes in place of bairstow who really hasn't been all that this tournament. I know this means we get saha in place of samad but that's definitely better balance i feel,6
"Not making gayle open(especially with no Mayank) is the equivalent of dropping abd to 6

Change my mind",10
Both the teams who got screwed by the Lord. Punjab got annihilated and SRH got double penetrated.  /s,5
Mandeep‚Äôs father passed away today.,9
Knowing us Mandeep will come to form.,7
AYO WHAT THE FUCK,3
Condolences to Mandeep Singh and his family üòî,22
These guys are absolutely sick in the brain. You have the world's best t20 opener and don't open him when your other opener isn't playing. What fucking nonsense am I witnessing? You want Gayle to play Rashid Khan ??????,5
Has Mandeep's father really passed? Google says the news is fake,1
"Punjab gonna smash SRH today, amirite guys?",10
Mandy vs Sandy you love to see it,10
So sorry about Mandeep. Hope he gives a good tribute to his dad today.,40
Punjab and Hyderabad still have better runrate than Kolkata,3
"My condolences, Mandeep. Really brave of you to play today.",58
[deleted],20
Another do or die. Heopefully we get the w,5
Why would you not play Chris Gayle against medium pacers??,3
WTF KXIP??? How brain dead retarded can you get. The most lollipop bowling attack and you don't get Gayle in to open??????,2
I want Mandeep to hit today so badly. It won't help him much personally but he still needs it,6
Really hope mandeep does well,5
Condolences to Mandeep's Family. Very brave of him to walk out today,8
[deleted],1
Why did they open with Mandeep ?,2
Gayle has a bad record against sandeep which is why I think kxip did not open with him,7
"@everyone in the match thread

Sandeep toys with Gayle most of the time, idk wtf you're thinking",6
[deleted],-1
"Oh man, hope KXIP wins for Mandeep today. That's sad.",5

"Jason Holder * exists *

Commentators: He tall",100
Ok so which morning disgraceful news outlet faked the news,0
"Anyways, why isn't Gayle opening?",5
What happened to mayank?,3
We're really toothless in attack without bhuvi. Like absolutely no threat this over at all,5
Classic captain trying to look smart move not opening with Gayle,2
"Can mods pin this comment for spamming condolences:

MANDEEP'S FATHER IS ALIVE, ON VENTILATOR, BUT VERY MUCH ALIVE",7
"So on air they said Mandeep‚Äôs father passed away. Players are wearing black bands, but there are articles from yesterday citing his brother denying the reports.

First news came 2 days ago, his brother denied it yesterday. Maybe there are new developments today?",4
Gayle scares the crap outta me. Always does well against SRH and reads Rashid Khan really well.,12
">Lost his father last night, but Mandy‚Äôs out here to open! Way to go, Mandy

Anyone else lose the beIN connect stream?,1
"When 3Ds showing his skills, I don't understand the purpose of another bowler. Has they taken Abhishek, there would be better depth in the battinng",2
Real Madrid scores,-2
Bruh Gayle would have killed em,1
Okay...so Rahul either gets out in 20s or after scoring 60 .... No inbetewen,2
"Guys, Mayank is probably injured from that runout with Pooran in the last matched. He was limping back.",5
"I thought it was unfair before, but I'm glad now that Kohli sacked Kumble.  Kumble has mismanaged Gayle game after game and cost Punjab games,",2
Fun fact : khaleel is literally Wasim Akram,2
How close is that?,2
So not only did DC just screw over KXIP's chances by losing earlier... It was also against us that Agarwal got injured. Damn. What did KXIP do to us to deserve this?,2
Why not open with Gayle?,2
Wtaf why the fk are they not opening with Gayle??? Earlier they slotted gayle at no.3 cos there was mayank but now they put mayank in front of gayle??? Senseless team decision making,2
Noooo. Not out please,3
What brain-dead running by KL! wtf,3
"This thread is gonna be dead, cuz of the el classico right?",0
"KXIP tweet now confirmed the demise of Mandeep's father.. RIP Hardev Singh.. Such braveness Mandeep, hope he performs well today :)",5
Is Mayank injured or did they let Mandeep play?,0
Thank god!,1
Even as a SRH fan I want Mandeep to do well today. Takes much courage to walk out to bat today.,8
Punjab winning,1
Wow Shankar Anna,3
Lol that was lazy from KL. He got lucky,5
"Wow, another quick 3rd umpire.",4
Oh KL you melon,4
"This is a shitshow about the Father's news. The players are wearing black bands, so obviously the news must have come from Mandeep. How can he be wrong ?",10
Lmao who told Bairstow to shave,4

"Sunny G trying to justify his ""Steyn-Stain"" joke.

I know its easy to criticize Gayle not opening but you have to plan for your the opponent's biggest threat: Vijay Shankar.,5
Mayank got injured last match right,2
KL must be feeling the pressure without Mayank,2
Punjab seem to get rattled under smallest amount of pressure. They only play well with a nothing to lose situation.,3
"If 3d helps srh to playoffs, as a tribute everyone should wear 3d glasses for a match..",4
We are fucking wasting the power play without Gayle. what a joke. Why would you send Mandeep there especially in the state he's in,4
How the fuck is maxwell is on gamechanger's list ?,8
"Very good over, only 4 was an edge.",1
I heard more news about death and dying in 2020 than in all the other years of my life put together.,3

"Unpopular opinion: 

Considering Indian population and interest in cricket, my thinking 12 years ago was that we would have an unbeatable team in 10 years but I think the expectations were not met. 

We are mostly top 3 but I was expecting an ABD, more Bumrahs, few Ben Stokes emerging from India.

Nonetheless it has not been for nothing.",2
Punjab don't deserve to qualify after they didn't send Gayle to open and wasted a good power play,-8
Rooting for a Mandeep century today,10

Oh no Shankar injured too now?,7
3D is unironically a massive loss for SRH if he isn't able to play the rest of this game,20
Looks like we're playing 10v11 again :))))),3
3D off the ground..,7
Good tight bowling,8
Maxwell should win the best impostor in the team award.,4
KL is truly Koach's successor in the overthinking department. Just open with Gayle ffs.,36
I feel there should be a appreciation thread for Sandeep. Almost everyone wrote him off.,1

"Now that Mayank is not opening, very little ""intent"" being shown in the power play.

Does Mandeep open for his state team or something? Can't imagine why you wouldn't otherwise open with Gayle.",5
guys call me when the post tea session starts,4
As long as we can build a base to jump off from we should be fine. Missing Mayank's explosiveness at the start but given the circumstances maybe Rahul should be the aggressor?,9
Fuck you Pooran for injuring Mayank with that nonsensical run attempt.,2
"KL plays like vintage Dhoni or VK thinking if he stays till the end he can win them the match but actually he is just putting stress on the other batsmen. He should give up that anchor role and play his heart out, trust his team mates to do their job and enjoy the game instead of making it shit tense for no fucking reason.",3
Chill guys. Those batsmen out there know what they're doing lol,6

Ayo what the fuck ?,3
Is it really that funny Kartik? Is it?,2
That sounded sweeeeet off the bat,5
"Honestly, gayle not coming in powerplay restricts him tbh. He needs around 10 dot balls to set his eyes in,which in powerplay could have been tonked for boundaries.",4
KL can play as slow as he wants if he starts striking the way he did against RCB in the last few overs of their first encounter.,7
Man if only KXIP had a player for whom outfields are irrelevant,24
wow what a shot,4
Mandeep is put in a messed situation here. Hope he does well,13
"Surface looks slow, or is Mandeep just not timing it well. That shot's usually a four in powerplay",6

"I cant understand who to support rn lol, i like both teams...",7
Where's Mayank? Just tuning in.,4
That was a good catch but Rashid unnecessarily goes on his knees while catching. Doesn't look like a smart technique of catching at all.,6
I watched 5 overs thinking that was Mayank lol,19
Rashid telling Samad to get the fuck away from the catch after his fielding just before,30
"Sucks for Mandeep,man.",8
Absolutely nothing shot from mandeep. Like there was no good outcome from that shot.,3
At least Mandeep didn't waste any balls,6
Tbh was hoping for Mandeep to hit a century but SRH to still win,5
Mandeep atleast tried to hit tbh,10
Samad got there to mess it up too,5
Rashid doesn't need APA.,1
So Mandeep had the job of playing away Sandeep Sharma to maake way for Gayle . Quite a good job I'd say.,3
Fuck that dude for making that tasteless comment on mandeep,5
Rashid has a bad record against Gayle.,6

Really wanted Mandeep to do well today. Hope he does well in his career. GG,1
Controversial opinion : Mayank should be on India's squad for WCT20. He's in prime form,11
MPL is claiming to change more lives than IPL.,8
I Remember Gayle destroyed a young Holder for a hat-trick of sixes when he played for CSK in 2013,5

Styris doesn't seem to be fond of SRH bowlers at all. If not all.,-2
That is just so good from gayle,5
effortless right there,2
Guys how does a huge built bowler like Holder bowl slower than Sandeep Sharma?,2
Wtf Gayle is all timing and placement today.,8
This is the length you Bowl if your brother is playing for the opposition -  Lord Swanny,6
Who's career will Gayle end today?,1
How does Holder bowl 115 & Nagarkoti 145 is out of me,11
These kind of shots > Power hitting,2
"For a fast bowler, Khaleel's chases are a sore to the eyes..",3
This is the kind of ball you would bowl if your brother is playing for the opposition and you want him to get off mark!!!!,-1
47 off 1 after 6 is a decent score.,2
Gayle has been a game changer for KXIP,9
Why are people getting surprised when Gayle is hitting classic grounded shots. He scored 2 triple hundreds ffs.,60
Can't believe I'm seeing Gayle focus on timing and placement,8
Rashid gets cunted by Gayle. Hope that's not the case today,9
"Kumble so shit, he had to watch dugout for all the strategies

-basically what dugout is saying",1
"Delicate, timing and placement from Gayle?

A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one",12
Srh is the only team in the tournament to not have a genuine quick bowler. All medium pacers,8
Is gayle going to cunt rashid today?,13
"I don‚Äôt get why not open with Gayle if Mayank was injured. None of the SRH pacers are express pace, and Gayle can have a huge over against one of them like he did against Deshpande.",10
I don't know why but Gayle is just so much interesting to watch even at age of 41.... Like he can still clear boundaries so clearly even at this age....,9
"I'm pretty sure it's Kumble who doesn't want Gayle to open for some reason. 

Definitely a dumb decision to let Mandeep open. He's a good middle order batsman, but never saw him opening in T20s.

Edit: Apparently, it's wise decision. Okay.",-5
17 yo Rashid vs 41 yo gayle,9
I can't help but enjoy Gayle hitting even if it is against us.,7
I feel like Sanjay Bangar might coach one IPL team next season,2
"One thing with Gayle. There will be hardly any twos...

He may compensate with 4s and 6s though",5
And so the nightmare begins....,6
I almost fell asleep before this shot,3
Gayleforce!,2
"Aight Gayle started, we're fucked bois",12
"Our remaining 3 matches are against MI, KKR and KXIP. It's gonna take a lot of effort for that number 4, huh?",12
That was a genuine bad ball,7
Oh god we're done,8
Gayle putting the oldies of CSK to shame.,25
Gayle getting ready to destroy economies,13
When did Sunny G become this shitty?,17
Great follow up ball from Rashid after that 6. Quality. Will be an interesting battle.,7
Is stanlake a decent death bowler? Anyone knows? Also how quick is he?,3
Rashid v Gayle is such a good little battle,5
YorkerRaj bowling,0
"If IPL was sponsored by Indian Government, they would've recovered replacement cost from Gayle's paycheck.",5
Saying ‚ÄòGayle‚Äô  and ‚ÄòKL‚Äô sounds the same,12
"Gayle is perfect anti-rashid weapon 
 
Has scored 43 off 19 balls against him so far",9
"As I said before, the Universe Boss deserves an IPL trophy.",4
Facemask beard Natrajan bowling,1
"Mayank, KL, Gayle, Pooran, Maxwell, Mandeep

Wow that batting lineup is insane",4
If Nattu misses his yorkers everyone of those missed ones will end up in stands.,6
Man that thing he calls a beard has got to go,7
Wow there's no one here huh,-12
Rcb should try and go for stanlake next year. Udana bowls like 1 over and bats at 9 anyway,5
"Why did KXIP let go of Sandy, btw? He played for us, 3-4 years, iirc.",6
"OMG I get its a cool nickname, but can Sunny stop saying Universe Boss in every sentence?",4
"I love how ‚ÄúUniverse Boss‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a gimmick anymore, it‚Äôs literally just his nickname",9
Really no one cares about SRH huh?,4
"Anjum saying Warner goes from mid off to mid off. So... he stayed put? :|

Edit: Left-right combo. Anjum - 1 Me - 0",-1
Why is crunch the new buzzword in dugout? Been hearing it a lot.,3
Sunil 'See what happens' Gavaskar.,8
"Gavaskar's need to say the same sentence multiple times is so trying to hear. 

He's probably one of the best Indian commentators out there (which isn't saying much), but the needs to keep working on his delivery.",5
"There's no hope for us, isn't it? 

~SRH fan here :(",4
Would love to see Gayle castled by Nattu,5
Iirc there was a stat shared last year which said SRH lose when Rashid gives > 30 something runs in his spell.,3
What would be the winning score??,3
I miss being in the fight for 4th place,0
Nattu's beard causes me pain,6
Anybody remember when Hanuma Vihari got Gayle's wicket on his IPL debut for SRH,4
Don't mind me I am still coming to terms with our defeat...,3
Haha that appeal,5
Desperate review???,10
Not out,4
Such a bad review.,12

Hooray review lost!,6
Above Gayle's knee roll = missing. It's a no brainer.,5
I'm drunk af  and I can see that's a not out.,4
That was a stupid Review,5
Which is the most boring team? Srh or RR. I think srh,0
People here have more opinions on Nattu's beard than on his bowling.,6
Lmao YJB,7
Now see a ball go for six,3
Haha jhonny u blind cunt,7

Natrajan‚Äôs beard makes me uncomfortable,5
"Rashid's eyes are failing him.

Hmm... So he's probably around the 32-40s region right now!",14
"Good umpiring, I thought it would be umpires call",3
Is mayank injured or dropped?,1
Can someone DM me a link for a working stream,-1
Why pitching criteria is considered in lbw review is beyond me,0
Pitched outside. Sanga saw that from the stands.,6
So anybody hear what Iyer had to say in post match interview?,1
Kumble wtf wait till the game ends,2
Gayle can‚Äôt even milk a single or two,4
"What a shit review tho

Probably triple green lmao",7

Damn that last ball deserved a wicket damn,11
[removed],4
It‚Äôs just the rule. Probably to disincentivize negative bowling,1
Rashid turned that ball a mile lmao,5
Anjum always talks like she started watching the tournament yesterday. Doesn't she know that Natarajan has been SRH's main death bowler for many matches now?,6
"Even in an unrelated match, nehra starts praising Dhoni.",17
KL Rahul making the case for test team.,-5
How can anyone believe Rashid is only 21 lmao,18
I reckon one of these needs to be the aggressor. Both can't be striking at 100 after the number of balls they've faced.,4
It blows my mind just how good Rashid Khan is. He could very well be the best T20 player ever by the end of his career,3
"Damn, I didn‚Äôt know Live comments was a feature until last week. I was always on New comments and kept refreshing.

Live comments is neat",10
"PSA: Pitching outside leg matters because it's the 'blind side' for a batsman and allowing balls pitching outside leg to be lbw would lead to boring, negative bowling.",66
I don't feel good about Rahul today. Probably another 55(50) inning at best.,9
We need to start firing by the 12th over the latest.,3
Baal bajuurg Rashid khan,2
Why didn‚Äôt they open with Gayle if Mayank was injured anyways,5
"*Batsman sees out best T20 bowler in the world to go after weaker bowlers*

"SRH players need to do Natarajan a favour and shave his ""beard"" while he's sleeping",4
Rahul should start attacking. They are wasting an in form Pooran,5
Gayle has to be one of the most astute cricketer in the world. Always played to his strengths.,4
"Nehra ji has come a long way since calling Thala ""bhosdiwala"" for dropping a catch off of him early in the days to licking his ass even in a non-csk match.",3

When did ncn become a bowling all rounder huh,2

Ayyy 3d is back on field,2
"Not good enough from KXIP

I‚Äôm loving this from our red ball captain,3
"Great job KL, aim for all the fielders, that's how you bat. Fucking fruitcake.",0
Don't understand this conservative approach from Rahul when you still have 3 batsmen left with one being your best ball striker.,2
"Orange cap tera hi hai bhai, strike rate badhale bhi badhale pls",6
Does this sub actually like any commentators?,7
KL Rahul back to playing Orange Cap knocks after Dhawan‚Äôs two 100s made the gap too close for comfort.,5
How to do this sort by live on Rif or website ?,2
What is this tuk tuk strategy,1
Holder bowling pretty smartly,1
Okay this phase of play has broken their momentum badly. Last 3 overs gonna have to be made up,1
Are you guys still going to downvote me for saying Gayle should have opened and we were way too slow and absolutely wasted the power play,-1
Mr.3D is back,1
Man... Is kxip playing slow?,2
"If KL doesn't start firing in 2 overs, he's playing wrong. You can't underestimate SRH, they can easily chase 200+ on good day.",3
Nice yorkers,2
165 should be enough in this slowass ground.,3
"Rahul with another Test-20 knock, even though they have Maxwell and Pooran in the sheds",2
Why didn‚Äôt Gayle open if Agarwal wasn‚Äôt batting,5
Fucking get hit wicket dude you're losing the match otherwise,1
Gayle is not unfit. Why doesn't he run quicker,5
fudge!!! gone,1
Rahul playing anchor is not a good idea anyway but even more so with Gayle at the other end who can't run 2s.,5
Jason my Man......,5
In comes Pooran!,7
"Carribean to carribean, fuck yeah",12
Doesn't it make more sense to aim for a above par total considering KXIP's weak bowling attack?,4
See you next year bois. We out,5
Yay,3
"Oof straight to the fielder

Decent catch",3
Is it compulsory to wear orange cap all the time as Rahul wore it at the toss also,7
LET‚ÄôS GOOOOO,8
This is a really good over from Holder barring the wide,2
Warner is gonna LOVE that one,2
Lame innings,2
Tom shellock wannabe takes the catch!,3
bhai 10 an over from here will only get you 170.. pls maar lo thode,7
Not letting Gayle hit and then getting him soon is really great for us.,8
Getting Gayle out after he has played 20(20) is a great great achievement,5
This Holder is impressive. Sad that he doesn't turn up as consistently.,4
"Maxwell HAS to redeem himself

The stage is fucking set",8

Holder throwing gang signs lmao,2
1 more wicket and we into the tail boys!,1
I want just one typical Gayle and Dhoni innings before they retire sigh....,7
KXIP missed a trick by not opening with Gayle and letting him unleash over the likes of Sandeep and Khaleel.,7
"Many might not know this but Swann had a major role in England's Test series win in India, the only home Test series india lost in that decade.",6
"Injured Mayank was the first blow, not opening with Gayle another. Powerplay wasn't utilised efficiently.",3
Oh fuck it's pooran,6
"Fucking cocksuckers , downvote me again for being angry at how slow we are playing. If you're happy with this you don't support Punjab. Nice guys finish last",-1
Now KXIP is with a terrible run rate and don‚Äôt know what to do,4
Holder doesn‚Äôt look ominous but plays to his strengths and bowls with a plan,2
tbf kxip shouldnt be in the playoffs cause of their coach's braindead decisions,5
wtf rashidd,2
KXIP really missing Mayank's power play acceleration here,6
Pooran ain‚Äôt not joke either can be just as destructive,3
Rashid you beauty,6
"Oooh that's a beauty

Rahul didn't pick that at all",4

"Get rekt Punjab, 3 wins against the top 3 and still can't learn shit.",4
Rashid seriously deserves more credit. He‚Äôs been carrying this SRH lineup this year. What a fucking gem,8
"Anjum is so clearly biased. First I saw her riding the toxic msdians bandwagon and now undermining Warner to show her love for Gayle. I mean sure he's the best but you're a commentator, you need to be neutral!",8

Tbf that KXIP top 5 is stacked. Get rid of one world class batsman for another to walk out (just pretend maxi is in form),2
"Rashid Khan, What a ball that was, truly a magician.",3
Pooran is the man for Poojab!,3
It‚Äôs like YJB took that wicket,2
Shit Maxwell's here,2
"Nice campaign u had there kxip, we'll miss u",1

Not gonna root for them to get that no4 spot",2

Both Gayle and KL going out for 100SR.,6
pitch bad or batsman bad?,2
Now watch Maxwell go for a duck,2
135-145 is my prediction for final score. SRH have the game by its balls.,5
"So, this is just one last chance for Maxwell to save the day Aand prove his worth.

Otherwise, KXIP will be OK TATA BYE BYE.",3
please don't get Big Dick Nick'd SRH,2

..... Have u guys seen him against Sandeep?",9
"This is why SR isn't overrated. Now, after they played at run a ball, they got out and the RR after 10 overs is just at 6.",6
Left the team in a hole again with his batting. And this guy is one of the leaders in the MVP race.,2
Letzooo maxi today is the day,3
You can tell YJB absolutely loves keeping to Rashid,10
"The way KL played, that ball looked even more beautiful",10
Last 5 overs 19 runs 2 wickets,3
What score are they targetting here? They have to play out of there skins to get 160-170 odd from here.,3
"Oh god Maxwell, not again",6
The No Show üòÇ,9
"Turned on the match to see KL Rahul bat. First ball I saw he got done in by Rashid

Get Pooran too please,7
That bairstow laugh has to be become a meme.,24
Another Orange cap saver innings by Rahul.,3
poor pooran has to save his team again,6
Glenn Minwell is here,7
Two new batsmen at the crease halfway down the innings. Srh have the advantage.,2
Guys top of middle stump. How good was that !,7
150 will be a good score here. Relying on pooran again.,4
People here really overestimating srh's batting. They literally have Vijay Shankar at number 4 lmao,7
[deleted],11
Please Maxwell play sensibly !,7
Anyone else remember that 2015 match where Warner took the catch of kohli and ran backwards into the boundary 2m back celebrating?,9
Can rashid do a bumrah equivalent of dismissing Morgan and Russell in a single over.,4
KL ‚ÄúStrike rate is overrated‚Äù Rahul out after a solid 27 (27) which leaves the team 66/3 in the 11th over,8
Hey is this a T10 match?? Why am I seeing 2 new batsmen coming out after 10 overs....,1
It's good thing for kX1p that kl got out,1
Warner has been probably the best captain this season after Rohit and Koach.,2
LMAO. Bairstow's reaction.,14
Get these 2 out and it‚Äôs game,5
I'll take 150,4
KXIP back to form!,0
If they get Pooran soon enough. That should be the game for SRH,1
I loved how mah boi Jonny loved that wicket,4
So neesham would have been useful today over Jordan huh,4
Hope no Poor-run episode today. KXIP can't afford this at all right now. Without Neesham their lower order is razor thin right now,5
I think we'd be happy for 150-155 at this point,2
"Is that a big, hairy caterpillar on Warner‚Äôs face?",7
Can we meme back Maxwell into form?,5
What‚Äôs up with Maxwell‚Äôs stance in the past few games,3
Ghislaine Maxwell has to turn up for KX now.,4
Hahah Maxwell has never been dismissed by rashid. Be scared,6
This seems like a horrible pitch ngl.,5
All is (max)Well,3
"Even with today's technology and data, it's still VERY hard for batsmen to overcome unfavorable matchups against bowlers. Warner still got out to Jofra. Rahul still got out to Rashid. Even Rohit Sharma lost his wicket to Sandeep.",11

Nice,0
"Run a two you cowards

What? Scared you gonna get run out

Well there go KXIP from the tournament. I‚Äôm not sure I back SRH to beat KKR to 4th place so the IPL is pretty much dead until playoff time,2

"Powerplay was not the problem

Neesham isn't playing? Wtf?,2
So Holder bowls his one in the death. Natfu has what 3 overs left. So Khaleel and Sandeep have to bowl 3 overs between themselves sad that 3d ain't bowling today.,7
pls csk dont play spoil sport,3
What has this stance really done for Taxi? He is so far away from the batsman that we all remember from 2014. Not saying it's because of the stance. But why?,3
Holder is consistently bowling Yorkers. Finally a good fucking Windian for us.,6
Pooran will prob attack Natrajan,5
Jordan at 7? Lmfao get fcked Punjab,6
Is pooran the most entertaining batsman this season,2
Sucks we don't have Neesham left. These two are essentially the only chance we have for a decent score,3
What's par score here?,2
"Holder has really refined his t20 bowling the past year. For the first time he has some actually useful variations, first time I‚Äôve seen him bowl the leg cutter, slower bouncer etc  so well and varies his pace almost every ball. Was too predictable in past and just bowled short when under pressure . Let‚Äôs see if he‚Äôs signed again next year",10

What was pathetic? RR's performance or Mirzapur's ending?,-9
Wow there's no one in these comments. It's all crickets,5
"If KXIP get over 160/70(hard enough) , we have a game to enjoy !",3
Maxwell won't hit a six with this awful technique,9
When do they start smashing em ideally?,1
Swann seems to be having a huge hate-boner for Maxwell.,8
KXIP Franchise is like Punjab state - Mediocre performer with lots of potential and bad management.,2
Please no Mirzapur spoilers here,1
What happened? Last I saw KXIP were cruising.,3
Bowl Rashid out next over. Pooran might start hitting.,1
Classic SRH choke in progress,10
Below 160 it's SRH game to lose,6
Swann doing more comedy than commentary,4
"KXIP didn‚Äôt play Neesh, got a long tail and now batting like bitch ass pussies.",7
"I think we can all agree that with csk being shit this season, this ipl has been 200% more entertaining.",7
We've all talked about which Coach is better for Indian team Kumble Or Shastri or someone else. What we don't talk is how having good Batting and Bowling coach is more important. See how Bharat Arun has been successfull as bowling coach. On other hand Sanjay Bangar and Vikram Rathore hasn't been that successful. Rahane still gets LBW early on with inswinger and our batters don't pick Leggies at all  just few examples of todayüòû,5
Pooran will have to go big this over,4
SRH struggles to chase anything above 160,9
Good thinking to end Sandeep's over now but I fear Pooran will smash him.,6
RIP Punjab. It was fun while it lasted,6
"Sandeep bowling always makes me nervous. At his pace he must nail length. If he bowls short, he‚Äôll be punished. His 125 km/h bouncers allowed Watson to easily punish SRH in the 2018 final even though there had been 2 maiden overs earlier.",8
"People last match: Jordan should be playing Kxip death bowling shit.

This match: Neesham should be playing over Jordan.",7
"Since y'all are giving me Mirzapur spoilers I'll give you Scam 1992 spoilers 


Harshad Mehta dies at the end",6
Kinda annoying SRH not having proper pacers tbh,6
Is Vijay Shankar still off the pitch? Any idea if he'll bat? Not sure if I missed something the commentators said,3
Pooran‚Äôs the danger man,3
Can we just talk about how much entertainment swanny gives us. Ipl needs to pay him extra.,4
Will Maxwell hit a six today? What's the odds?,2
Will Maxwell ever hit a 6?,5
Still no six by Maxwell,3
"Srh,pls trade bhuvi to us. He is always injured,you guys need better bowler.",2
Oh Maxi...,2
Maxwell can be name of a medicare company.,7
"Damn Rashid overdone his coach, what a player",3
This match looks difficult for KXIP,3
Smh Maxwell,2
Fucking fraud of a player jesus fucking christ fuck off,3
[deleted],1
Wish I had as many chances in life as Maxwell does with Punjab,13
No show again,2
"Taxi, as always üòê",5
"Braindead shot. On brand for you, Maxi",8
We aren't going past 140,6
Mwwwhahahahhaaah,2
Has maxwell ever hit a six?,7
100$ says Maxwell will be on the team for next match too,29
Why hasn‚Äôt Maxi been dropped?,8
Aussie caught an Aussie,3
Poor Maxi,3
"is williamson still ""injured""",2
"GLENN ""THE BIG SHOW"" MAXWELL",5
Angry Warner üò°,1
Glen Kedar Maxwell,5
KXIP playing *Find the Fielder*,3
I said he won't hit a six with that awful technique,2
KXIP giving us catches like DC did to VC,3
I still think the finals should be a best of 3,1
Still 0 sixes for Maxi,3
"Sandy is the perfect hit bait in the death overs, change my mind",1
"**13.4** Sandeep Sharma to Maxwell, OUT,  **85-4**

GJ Maxwell c Warner b Sandeep Sharma 12 (13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 92.30",2
Somebody pulled a proper one on Natarajan saying his beard looks alright,3
Maxwell and Mandy are batchmates in the can‚Äôt-hit-a-six-to-save-a-life school right now,3
I think even Pooran knew this was coming that's why he is playing more responsibly,4
Atleast drop maxipads for the remaining matches so we can shit on neesham.,3
Ffs drop Maxwell the guy just can't score,4
"Bruh. More than 70% of the time, Maxwell is a disappointing batsman. It's only those few occasions that really make the difference.",3
And the wait for Maxwell game changing innings since forever continues .,8
P√©tition to remove Minwell from KXIP,5
I am supporting srh but i feel sad for kxip lol,6
"Maxwell not showing up yet again, shocker",3
"NO ONE has been able to connect today. We have a lot of versatility in how every batsmen bats and still none of them have connected well. 

 Says a lot about the pitch",3
KXIP have definitely missed Mayank today,3
kings 11 deserve this for persisting with maxwell for this long,5
"Get Pooran, win the match",2
"Every time Maxwell comes out to bat I think 'maybe today is his day, maybe he'll finally figure out how to bat decently'

And every time I'm let down",5
Maxwell season sixes count: 0,3
"Ayyy Hooda is on the crease, expecting 2 dropped catches and 4 miscues that land nowhere",4
Good knock from off spinner here but why was he batting at 5 instead of 8,4
I don't think that was a bad shot. Just didn't get the execution right. The RR needed to go up and he tried it after getting set. Just didn't get it right.,2
Hooda shitting all over SRH would be peak 2020,6
Hooda!!! Our boi...,2
What exactly is their rational not bringing in Neesham when they're down Mayank.,3
They released Sam Curran last year and now are stucked with Maxwell and Neesham,4
"Maxwell is literally the biggest IPL fraud, picked for a heavy price on basis of international performance but does fuck all in IPL",7
So dropping Neesh doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea anymore!,3
For fucks sake what are you guys getting by spoiling shows for each other? Enjoy the match which is going on. There's already too much negativity on reddit.,0
"I think as a CSK fan, I spread the curse of ""no intent BC"" to the DC and KXIP by supporting them",3
"I see what Hoodra's going for with that left arm sleeve tattoo, but on TV it just looks like he has really saggy and twisted skin.",3
Duno sheer wale team bahar IPL sey. Welcome to the club :),1
warner's captaincy has been superb today,1
"Switches channel to see the score sees exact same score as us at this stage, cries again",3
Never seen Pooran even trying to settle. He just always goes right from the start. Don't know how to feel about this.,3
"The day they need a redditor, he's dropped",3
Warner is clearly taking advantage of his captaincy privileges... padding up his catching stats by placing himself in key positions.,3
Just reduced the freaking boundary size. 80m boundaries in T20s are too long.,-2
"Dafuq? How was that wide?

Yup that was wide. My bad",4
Maxwell desperately asking IPL scriptwriter to write his redemption arc....,5
SunRIDERs Punjab,5
Maxwell definitely walked in on one of the owners indulging in bestial sex or something.,6
Maxwell starring in The Usual Suspect,5
"Now that Maxi's out, Pooran will start attacking only after 17",4
Have someone in your life who trusts you as much as KXIP trust Maxwell,5
That's not a wide. Wtf,4
Kl Rahul will make up for maxwells cost by bowling him 4 overs,6
"Its amazing how some players get given chance after chance despite rarely showing any sort of class, and others play one average game and get canned immediately.",6
"Hooda was absolutely atrocious for SRH. I'm glad he's out of the team, let's see what he can do for KXIP",10
Imagine being bounced by Sandeep Sharma,15
"Can we consider Maxwell the same player as Afridi?

Love them both regardless, there something when they are at the crease that makes you believe lmao",6
That was not a wide sir,6
Play Neesham instead of Maxwell,6
Hooda pls play like you played for us,38
"Guys Bairstow was upset at the wide, can we hate him now?",-4
Everyone trying to hit straight sixes and getting caught is very Cricket 19.,6
So what do you think the final score will be... Ima say 135,2
Lol remember when sandeep used to play for KXIP and hooda for SRH?,10
Guess I'll have to jump on the RCB train for playoffs,5
Fuck off is that a wide #EndTheBatriarchy,6
Imagine getting bounced out by Sandeep sharma,5
10 an over from now gets 147. Hopefully we won't concede more than that.,5
Fuck.. KXIP can't lose today please,5
"I think Jason Holder is pretty under-rated as a T20 player.

-As a bowler he can swing the ball in the powerplay & is always a threat.
-Pretty handy as a batsman
-Incredible fielder
-Is a brilliant leader & can provide outputs to the Cap as well as young bowlers.

Only negative I can think of is death bowling. He has the control to bowl yorkers but he doesn't have enough *variations*. Love him as a player. Captain !",7
Can we give Kanos temporary Indian citizenship just so we can bypass the stupid 4 international player rule and just enjoy the class of the man. It's almost criminal for even a debate for him to be in the team.,8
Maxwell for CSK next season at 1 cr,7
"Lmao, Sandeep can bowl a wide bouncer?",4
David Warner looks like a racist cop with that moustache,11
"Hooda, Mandeep, Gurkeerat, Prabhsimran. Rando Punjabi boys who are good at cricket but don't always get into the first string team at the beginning of the tournament",2
Pooran will take Rashid on,3
Beat all the table toppers just to lose to srh.smh,4
sheldon cottrell in deep thought,3
Hooda we paid you so many seasons for being shit. Please return the favor today,10
"PuNjAb iS a BeTtEr TeAm ThAn KkR, ThEy DeSeRvE tO qUaLiFy aNd KkR dOnT",11
Get Pooran and we are done for the day.,4
Plz Pooran ffs it's Rashids last over :(,2
We need more from Hooda than his usual 21 (17) not out,3
KXIP need to accept Maxwell isn't going to perform and drop him,6
"Lmao, Hooda still sucks",9
"Nifty work from Bairstow

Well bowled as well",10
"Hooda, what were you doing in nets while in SRH lad??",9
[deleted],2
So will punjab be out of the playoff race if they lose today?,3
He's in the air. Wow!,6
Yayy. That's out,5
Lot of clueless people commenting on lack of pace in SRH bowlers fail to understand that this kind of sluggish pitch suits these type of bowlers. Pace off is the way to go on this pitch. We are in second half of the tournament now and these pitches are worn out and tired showing their true nature (which is traditionally being slow and sluggish).,12
I think the other dugout guys are getting sick of Graeme Swann's shit,5
Yeah comfortably out,5
Would be peak Hooda if Bairstow drops the ball,3
Time nearing to fade‚Äôem KXIP flairs,6
Love the Rashid and Bairstow combination,10
Adolf Warner,7
Hahaah bairstow you beautyyy,7
F for Hooda,9
Hahahahha Swanny,3
Waiting for the SRH fans to say that they can't chase 100 odd üëç,13
Wow get fucked Punjab,8
SRH fans not surprised by that probably,25
Silver duck for Hooda vs his old team,8
Gone boys.,6
This argument of which team is deserving to qualify is stupid. Whichever team qualifies is deserving to qualify. As simple as that.,37
ffs just bat 20 overs u fools,9
"Said it before, will say it again. Hooda is use-fuckin-less.",5
very here for the bairstow-rashid bromance,14
Hooda still remembering his SRH days,12
"**14.2** Rashid Khan to Hooda, OUT,  **88-5**

Rashid gets Pooran and he‚Äôs my MotM ... regardless of whoever scores the runs in the chase,10
Faithful hooda,9
Thank u hooda bhai,11
Choking again,3
That‚Äôs why we dropped you buddy,26
There's the Hooda SRH fans know and love and absolutely don't miss,26
Man these pitches behave so erratic or the players make it seem so,3
Is Jordan good??,2
"well, technically it's difficult for both teams to qualify after KKR""s match today.",2
"Feel bad for pooran, reminds me of Curran situation",4
Didn't knew MSD has ginger hair and is English?,8
what tf was that umpiring his foot never went back in the crease lmao,3
Deepak Hooda is shit. That one KXIP fan who always defends him is his family member.,13
Loving this umpire and his quick decisions,8
"I can imagine Bairstow setting up a company that makes bobblehead figurines of cricket players, just because he loves Rashid Khan so much he wants to own a bobbly Rashid. And for that matter, I want one as well.",8
"Playing so well for the last 3 games and then end up with this shitshow today, come on KXIP why you gotta do this to me",14
"‚ÄúSorry for shouting and if I gave your Granny a heart attack there, sorry Grams‚Äù

Pre- Renaissance Punjab: Well Hello There.,6
The third umpires took offense of all the roll forward roll back jokes and are now going faster than Shaw's presence at the crease,38
Lol that guy on the left in dugout is so sick of Swann,4
"Rash went for 9 in his first and look how he recovered, this man is gonna stay at SRH till the day I die smh",36
Rashid for the kill always,7
"If KXIP releases only 4 player Maxwell, Nair, Cotrell, Gowtham they would have 31 crore+ in purse",14
I'm actually surprised these ad hungry whores are okay with strategic timeout being taken in middle of the over if a wicket falls.,23
Are people still rooting for KXIP over KKR?,4
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST,7
"Teams 4, 5, 6 and 7 are equally meh. CSK is straight up shit.",8
Hooda doesn't even show intent and gets stumped out smh.,8
Just get Pooran and we will get low total.,8
SRH going to reverse jinx their way into the playoffs again aren't they,18
I'm not really convinced by Maxwell's new stance. It worked in the ODIs against England but there he had time to pick each ball at its merit. In T20s where he will have to score faster his arms don't seem to be as free as they should be. Ii know it's just IPL where Maxwell has been a no show even with his previous stance but I really hope his international T20 performance isn't impacted. It will be a shame given he really dominates the international scene,7
Keep squeezing bois,5
"KX is like *uper ke teamonko hara diya, hamara kaam ho gaya. Ham chalte hai*",4
"Shami is going to bowl out of his skin today, give some hope before seeing it crushed since the target will be small. Gotta mentally prepare myself for that",7
Restrict them to less than 150 and no need for boundaries even. Just hit the ball to Gayle and run two every time. Not like he can stop the extra run.,10
Which team will be dumb enough to pick Maxwell for 2 mil next season?,8
Holders addition really brought stability,10
[deleted],3
Poorans still there,2
Sunrisers have the best bowling lineup despite abscense of 140 kmph bowlers,7
I doubt if Kings 11 Punjab actually has any long term fans. The team never had a core group.,6
Man Idk I still think KKR don't deserve a place in Top 4. It should be KKIP or us(selfish me).,12
Thank god for Rashid Khan,3
"Bairstow‚Äôs ‚ÄúAhahahaha RASHIDDDD‚Äù man love this stump mic 
except DK earlier oof",14
Calm d f down rashid,5
Swanny‚Äôs Bairs impression is ticking hilarious,7
Young Johnny Bairstow and Young Rashid Khan. Bromance.,11
Rashid Khan is a cheat code smh,6
The last boundary was in the seventh over,10
"Maxi's only good(ish) innings was against DC which forced Punjab to keep him on. Man, DC really ruined Punjab's chances.",4
I love Swanney being in the Dugout as much as he loves the golden Tata Altroz!!,3
"lmao, Rashid went for 9 in his first over, then 5 in his next 3. What a legend",8
What an over Rashid take a bow!,5
We could've done so well this season if Bhuvi was fit.,6
KXIP knew that them stomping in the first half of the tournament and shitting the bed in the 2nd half was getting too predictable. So they decided to disappoint the fans more subtly by giving them a shimmer of hope in the 2nd half.,7
"Bruh 1-0-9-0 to 4-0-14-2. What a man, Rashid",8
Rashid is a fucking cheat code,10
Rashid‚Äôs asylum to the UK confirmed. Bairstow will be the sponsor.,8
"Rashid takes 2/14 in 4 overs and I don't even think of it as a special performance

Ridiculous how well he bowls regularly that I think of this as just another performance",13
88 in 15 overs. That's some great bowling. Now get Pooran at all costs.,2
"Can any of you imagine if MI, RCB or maybe even RPS (and then CSK) got Rashid?",10
Srh is in control only till sir khaleel comes into picture,7
Hotstar comment section honestly feels just like r/cricket -50 IQ points,11
Bairstow reading Rashid is art!,4
Kings 11 removed Sarfaraz and Karun after 2 bad games while Maxwell gets to play full season. Still living in 2014,10
SRH's bowling unit doesn't look impressive on paper apart from Rashid but boy do they perform as a singularity on the field. I like how they complement each other.,7
What a spell by Rashid! Best Leggie for quite some reason !,4
"Oh lol vintage Punjab is back lads.

Though I do wonder why Mayank didn't play up top to offer stability, especially since Mandeep has recently lost his father.

Fair fucking play to Hyderabad though, even without any express pacers (unless you count Khaleel who can touch 140kph sometimes) their bowling is still ridiculous, bolstered by the inclusion of Jason Holder. They seem to have found their ideal balance now, and their fielding is nothing short of excellent",9
Rashid is one madlad of a bowler. Such amazing consistency,5
"Honestly Rashid is just ridiculous. Playing against him is like only having 18 overs to score, because his 4 only go for half as many runs as anyone else",11
Khaleak and Pooran last hope for KXIP,4
Man Rashid is so top notch that his 2-14 is so casually done,10
"HOW ARE THERE FIELDERS EVERYWHERE, FUCK OFF",14
srh coming into their own as the three uae pitches deteriorate to suit their bowling attack and low sr batting lineup is a nice theory that im going all in on believing regardless of how much i get hurt,6
"Next season with bhuvi back, our bowling will be fucking diamond",20
6 of Rashid's 14 conceded runs came from one ball,12
[deleted],8
"Well, this match has been a bit of a dud so far",4
"KXIP needs to drop maxwell, bring in neesham for maxi",1
Are they holding back Khaleel for Pooran?,0
Shower thought: Wonder what happened to fans of teams like the Lions and Pune. Do they support like one primary franchise now close to their region or is it more player based and they just root fot the players they like.,3
Jordan never comes off as a all rounder for me.tbh.,4
"""rare error from Natarajan"" - I don't think so",10
I still can't believe Jonty Rhodes is going to Sweden. Such cool news.,8
DC playing 10D chess by deliberately losing against KKR so they don't have to face the wrath of Gayle or YRKFA,6
"I'll admit, I thought that Rashid Khan had been 'found out' by last year, great to see him still having such impact.",8
"KXIP should release Maxwell and buy 
Rassie van der Dussen this team will look unstoppable. Rassie can do damage control and also make 30(18) on most days üëå",7
Which over was the last hit boundary by this team?,3
"Jordan running gives me excitement now , it's truly a wierd year",1
"3D thinking from Dehli to first let Maxwell play well against them to screw over Punjab's chances of winning, and then to lose to KKR to reduce KXIP and SRH's chances of qualifying even more.",4
Jordan at no 7 is batting about 2-3 positions higher than he should be batting.,2
No boundaries since 1984,9
I wanna go to Dubai Expo 2020 üò≠,2
The Fizz,1
Does SRH have a sub? Take a look at r/reversejinx it's not taken,6
Did Bairstow thank Jesus?,1
So Kane Williamson will never play in SRH 1st 11. They're back to playing Allrounders like Cutting and Henriques.,10
Nice comeback from Nattu after the previous match.,3
"Hoping this is our obligatory low score defending match if this year, we have one almost every year",1
"If you ever watch Rashid live in a stadium, you will realise why he is naturally unplayable. Back of the hand, and very, very quick. No mystery, just great execution.",20
Nice to see nattu mixing it up.,7
"Punjab hasn't lacked luck, its lack of intent  
Their captain is playing for orange cup eyeing Aus series  
They don't deserve top 4",7
"Beast Sunrisers bowling

We could've easily qualified if Bhuvi was healthy",15
No boundary since 7th is too wild,4
"Love how we find a new bowler every year

Fizz , Kaul (2018), Rashid, Nabi and now Nattu

Let's hope this continues next season",8
Did Thala give off his jerseys to entire KXIP team?,14
Seems like the boundaries too faaar,6
When will nattu get rid of that horrendous facial hair?,7
Nattu looks like chapr.. with that facial hair,2
"It's good that kX1p is getting rekt, if they qualify then every match will be this shitty cry fest where kl cries after fucking with his SR",4
"even on a slow pitch against a bad side, srh squeezing the life out of a batting lineup is beautiful sight",3
Would wait till Holder's batting to say whether Nabi would have been a better choice. Till that time well played Holder.,3
Maxwell's performance has been complete shit this season. Guy is not even hodling the bat properly anymore. Smh.,3
KXIP probably was everyone's lowkey favoured team for 4 and now they are fucking it up at the wrong time. Need some brilliant bowling display from Bishnoi and Shami to keep them in the hunt,3
"Jordan used to be Budget Archer before Archer emerged, I thought he could do a little more with the bat than what's he's done this season.",6
Everyone talking about Natarajan's beard and not about Warner's mustache.,4
"I can see us not making the playoffs after losing to MI, RCB, and SRH given how listless we look right now.

Oh Delhi, never change!",2
Kane over Barstow for retention as much as I love em both,3
Need me a girl who holds on to me the way we're holding maxwell.,15
Pooran needs to hit 80 in the last 4 overs or Punjab have no chance,3
Last weekend had 3 superovers. This weekend has all 1-sided games???,4
I swear to god if Maxwell suddenly becomes god in australia,22
It just feels good to keep supporting this team because every fucking guy in it complements the other so well. Amazing lads!,14
Styris analysis of Maxwell technique on point,12
I hope KL Rahul did his field placement HW like Warner did,4

"Saying a batsman with low strike rate is playing a ‚Äútest innings‚Äù in IPL is degrading to test cricket. In T20s, a low strike rate innings is typically because of mistimes, and swings and misses. You can‚Äôt get away with lack of control in test cricket.",11
Excellent bowling by Neckbeard Nattu.,1
Predict the KXIP score : I say 136,1
Remember when JL said Maxwell is as good as Virat?,6
Kumble's role as coach comes under questions after poor team selection and  batting order,3

Someone tell punjab it's a T20 not a test,1
Massive Respect to Mandeep Singh. He lost his father yesterday and still came to play today. This is committment. I hope he get success that he deserves. I believe he is a really talented batsman.,11
Hoping for a classic Thala finish from Pooran,2

Yay. The No-Boundary combo streak survived Khaleel!,2

10.3 overs without a boundary is that a record?,8
Who were the top 10 player buys for this year IPL?,1
Holder going good with his unplayable full tosses,3
Damn Jordan forgot to go for a jog before reaching the crease.,5
guys what‚Äôs a boundary,8
Y‚Äôall think KXIP score a boundary next match?,4
Holder seems to bowl at a irritating line where you can neither smack him or leave that ball mostly.,13
This was coming. Jordan wasn't picking Short length well.,5
Neesham would've done better than cj,6

KXIP have a batsman who has 4 career runs in IPL at no 8 lmao. Truly tragic.,2
Holder has really given the stability SRH needed.,5

Top 4 sealed. Only a question of top 2,-6
"Honestly though, is the pitch that slow? Poor batting? Good bowling?",2
What a replacement Jason holder has been!!!!!!,11
11 overs without a boundary,0
CSK can now at least brag about being able to score as fast as teams half their age lol.,3
Why doesn't holder bend a knee after he went ranting on ipl not doing it. Someone has to start you tall boy.,1
"I'll give him the benefit of doubt because he's Nicholas fucking Pooran, but I'm really puzzled by this innings.",7
They are showing orange cap in scorecard also wtf,10
Pooran batting 18 balls and without a boundary is such an anomaly. I never saw him bat so slowly.,16

CSK would be proud of this batting performance.,5

What a fucking throw,2
"It‚Äôs the man again, Vijay Shankar!",3
"the pitch is clearly slow, hence pooran's innings alongside everyone except gayle struggling to hit, but i think srh's lineup suits a slow pitch nicely",2
Third dimension: fielding. First the tactical Stokes drop now this.,4

Good thing Vijay Shankar hit the stumps or Warner may have been pissed at Khaleel,1
"*Can ya do that, Ambati??*",6
This match is so boring,-2
Pooran is probably waiting for 21st or 22nd over to hit some boundaries.,3
Am I late for the 3D jokes?,1
3D got his mojo back after the 50 last match,5
It‚Äôs amazing the things confidence can do,3
"**18.2** Ahmed to Ashwin, OUT, **a direct hit at the non-striker's end.** And Ashwin is well short. Full slower ball outside off, gets well forward and opens the face to run this to point. Shankar swoops down on that and releases quickly to hit the stumps on the half volley **110-7**

"What a shitty performance by KxiP, how do you play so well for 3 games against the top 3, and absolutely SHIT the bed after that",2
3d shankar taking his tag seriously with that direct throw,6

Finally a boundary,1
Finally!!!,1
Fine-fucking-ly,3
MSK Prasad : I saw the spark,5
"I think KXIP didn‚Äôt bother to plan their innings according to the conditions. Everyone just came, ate up a few balls, tried to accelerate and got out.",3
A boundary!,2
A boundary? I haven't heard that word in years,6
Oof Finally a boundary after 70 balls..!!!,1
A BOUNDARY,1
Is this pitch really that difficult? I don't want another MI vs CSK today.,3
Its that type of day for SRH isn't it?,1
11.3 overs for a boundary,1
Nitish Rana played a day after losing his father-in-law. Mandeep Singh playing after losing his father. Nothing but respect for these two.,3
Finally a boundary,1
After that super over sunday every match since has been a one sided snooze fest this week.,3
Pooran is gonna go ham now. I can see it and I'm not from future.,2
First boundary in 11 overs... The fuck man....,3
finally a boundary!,3
r/cricket just CAME collectively together when they saw that direct hit. 3D enuf said.,13
BONDARY,1
69 balls for a boundary,10
Wow nice dive from Bishnoi,1
Boundary streak is kill,2
I was just thinking before this over. Should have gone with Shankar.,2
Wtf khaleel . where r u standing,8
"Ohhhhh

Finally a boundary",3
Khaleel you can collect the throw even standing next to keeper,6
Why khaleel asshole so far from stumps,4
Khaleel stand at the stumps man,10
Khaleel fucked up that run out chance lol,7
Why wasn't Khaleel back at the stumps wtf,13
Why is Khaleel not standing besides stump,10
"At this rate, Khaleel is gonna get dropped next game.

SRH fans, Sid Kaul is your next match's death bowler.",9
lmao what was khaleel doing so far from the stumps bruh,9
Warner that didn't look good :(,8
"""The last time I. Saw a spark like this boundary was when the fireworks started in 2011"" - MSD",5
That was well executed yorker,10
Why the fuck don't the bowlers back the wicket! Ffs! Second time it happened in this match,9
That was a freak yorker,9
Lmaooo Warner‚Äôs like DAFUQ,9
That's twice Khaleel has done that today,7
"Shit is serious when Bairstow says ""takes em""",12
That should've been run out. Poor from  khaleel,6
I wanted to make a joke about our chokehold and how Warner should dress up as Vader and the rest as stormtroopers. But then we wouldn‚Äôt be hitting anything later.,6
Shot by Pooran. Unacademy still waiting for their ad tho :(,9
That's the nicest boundary ever. Nice,5
Vijay Shankar is genuinely a decent cricketer and deserved to be in the WC squad over Rayudu and I'm glad people are starting to see that he's not just a meme now,11
Khaleel is braindead. Even YJB was telling him to get to the stumps,20
Why didn't Gayle start? Makes no sense!,2
Khaleel bowled good today. REALLY GOOD.,3
Khallel cannot understand English,3
KXIP always does this. Keep the battle for 4th spot spicy only to die down at the end,4
"For a must win game, KXIP's approach has been terrible all innings. 

They haven't played with any kinda desperation and positivity.

Really disappointing after they strung 3 Ws in a row and gave their supporters hope.",4
"Anyone doesn't like Khaleel? He's so irritating, even he's playing well.",5
"There is no aggression, there is no passion there is no mental state in this team!",6
Is Shankar fit enough to bat?,1
"So this pretty much solidifies KKR's no4 spot 
 
Would need top effort from SRH to win last three matches",2
"Khaleel bowling decently, what timeline is this?",3
Khaleel always does something silly,1
"Khaleel with a 7.75 economy, wow",5
Reminds me of Boult‚Äôs violent hit that knocked out Sam Curran,5
"Murder, climb aboard the murder train",2
The unacademy questions are stupid af.,3
Nattu watch the batsman,2
What has happened to Pooran?,3
"""i learn from others' mistake and do better"" - KXIP",7
"Just started watching, what were the highlights tonight?",3
Udana has 17 Yorkers while bowling an avg of 2 overs,5
Outfield looks much faster now. Should be walk in the park for SRH,3
Yay more boundaries!,2
Gg incompetant umpires,3
Trevor Bayliss needs to get his teeth fixed. The dentist in my can‚Äôt take my eyes off them,2
Shit opinion Anjum,3
Wtf,3
natarjan is good at following the batsmen's early movement,3
Tfw you realise this is not Discord so you cant spoil,2
That's wasn't wide wtf,5
Ya'll jinxed Khaleel. wait untill he finishes  his 4,4
Warner gives his 110% for SRH,21
Warner looks like he's gonna burst out. Boy take it out while batting.,3
How the hell was that given as a wide,12
"I can't figure out if this is a batting fuck up, bowling  masterclass , pitch being shit 

Or a combination of all 3",6
Wait the first one was a wide!? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.,8
PoOrAn iS gOiNg tO tEe OfF nOw,2
Warner is so passionate for srh,17
WTF that was given wide,4
[deleted],9
This is the most boring fucking game I‚Äôve seen in my entire life,10
Was Pooran taking tips from Dhoni?,1
Still discussing the stupid fan questions.,5
Fantastic bowling,8
SRH doing a great job of choking pooran with yorkers,10
Is Holder leading the bowling side?,3
Thala mode : ON,4
New look bring out his 3D game...the bad omens were in the beard,4
Natarajan has been a revelation this season. Consistent for SRH.,8
"Still, how was that wide?",8
Ooooof them yorkers from Nattu!,7
Yorker King üëë,7
why are they showing Holder after every ball like he is captaining the team?,6
*Nutted*,5
No need of on field umpires if they can't adjudge that,1
Nattu nailing Yorkers like it is EA sports cricket '07.,10
Nattu on fire here,6
Wtf happened to Pooran? Not like we have World class bowlers?,5
Nattu‚Äôs chin pubes power those deliveries so everyone stfu,23
Warner reminds me of a 'smile if you like men's prostate' Toby with a moustache from The Office.,6
Natu bowling like a g,7
2 sixes and 7 fours,5
Bowling like a champ against Pooran.,12
Pooran proper cpl player,4
"Guys, give credit to the bowlers too, Pooran definitely wants to hit boundaries, but the bowling isn't allowing him to",29
Good execution of the wide yorkers.,9
Nattu bowled well this game after going for runs in the last 3 matches.,8
This is very poor commentary,11
Kxip bowling has to produce a miracle to win this match.,7
Where did the people saying that KXIP deserved the 4th spot more than KKR go?,20
Bad throw,6
Rayudu jinxing 3Ds throwing..,11
Wtf was that throw. It was a sure shot run out.,8
Pooran neutralized so easily.,7
What the fuck is up with Natarajan bowling yorkers at will? God damn that is some over.,46
WTF is that lady commentator talking about.. bowling allrounder.. so irritating,11
Vijay Shankar hit the good length on the pitch. Somebody remind him that he's fielding?,24
given away a few runs with sloppy fielding now :/,8
Never seen this type of innings from Pooran what was he waiting for,3
We need a good 3 4 wickets in the powerplay to have any chance,10
This match is gone. SRH wins.,6
This is our match unless we do a real mega fuck up.,12
Why Pooran why .... you could have done this last match. BC humko hi lapetna zaroori tha kya,13
127 to chase,2
Nattu making Pooran look like a SRH middle order batsman trying to accelerate lmao,41
Nattu was amazing today,13
Why isn't Pooran going for sixes o_0,6
Best death bowling by SRH I‚Äôve seen in so long!,23
"Phenomenal bowling and fielding. 

Batsman‚Äôs game to loose",23
Kxip: Chief  the spirits have got me.,7
Classic SRH chokehold.,19
"Nicholas ""Strike rate is overrated"" pooran",7
"Said it before, say it again. Kxip is an inexplicable squad , beating all the greats, getting beat from the lesser ranked teams",17
Some how srh seems to have the most avg bowling attack but they always do decent,24
"Well Kings at least you fought, all the best next season",9
CSK 114/9 > KXIP 126/7,20
natarajan yorker spam <3,7
Some really brilliant captaincy and management from SRH. We really had a plan for every batsman and every situation.,18
"Maxwell is one of my fav player but 

Please drop him ffs",13
Hope the openers just play normally and don't try to rush this,8
Shami needs to bowl 24 yorkers today,18
Warner looks like a man on mission today. Won't be surprised if he takes SRH home while batting.,14
"Even if the pitch is slow and the outfield is pathetically slow, SRH should be able to chase this. Advantage of batting 2nd.",13
[deleted],-6
Wait so if KXIP loses today and win all the next 3 they can still get there right?,5
"You look at SRH bowling and it's always been young guns stepping up, their support staff when it comes to bowling has been doing so well",13
Haha here i was thinking we were gonna win all from here. Wtf is wrong with me,11
How much more balanced and threatening SRH looks once they abandoned the 3 foreign batsmen theory!!,9
"T Natarajan

Varun Chakravarthy 

Washington Sundar 

Murugan Ashwin

Ravichandran Ashwin


Tamil Nadu players shining in a season where Chennai Super Kings have shat the bed. Satisfying af, ngl.",54
We did really well to contain Pooran. Looks like he was waiting to balst off in the death with wickets falling around. But the boys did really well in the death.,6
Yo we back on track being the best bowling side,16
"I love how Natrajan didn't change a thing after he went for 40+ in the last match, backed his strength and executed perfectly. It takes courage to not let outside noise detract you and keep doing what made you get to this level in the first place. 

You might know what's coming but he's so good with his execution and skills that's it's still really hard to hit.",48
Kxip have done a csk here!,4
It's routine for Him but how good was Rashid 2-14 is good figures in any game,5
The bigger question is that have punjab learned their lesson about Maxwell the clown and will they retain him in auctions?,3
Another 10 wicket win?,5
Why would they show no intent in a do or die game? Even a 150-9 would've been much better than this,10
Ngl. Csk 114 yesterday was far more entertaining than this snooze fest,9
"Do people even understand what happened in this match? Pooran was under immense pressure the entire time as the other end was dropping like flies. Since he came out to bat, the other end barely managed to contribute anything to the total. Also great death bowling to limit his hitting arc",22
"KXIP:

The most entertaining team in this year's edition.

"Rashid Khan is so good, he makes 2/14 look average",23
Scenes if we choke this. *Trying to reverse jinx*,11
Only 40 runs worth of boundaries tonight.,7
Lol Doull's picking up Hindi,8
I am still skeptical of SRH winning. They fuck up real bad.,11
Ya'll calling it a one sided match. you are underestimating  our batting.,16
"If KXIIP loses, blame Kumble. In the break, we can clearly see he was saying something to   
 Pooran and the way he batted tuk-tuk cricket afterwards, the message was bat deep as it is not a big scoring pitch.",12

[removed],-23
Is this gonna be a low scoring thriller? Aren't the scriptwriters supposed to be back on job today?,5
David Warner really is a great player,11
"If it comes to NRR , SRH will make it over KXIP and KKR anyway. We don't have to go all guns blazing and win by 14th. Can play safe and win in 18 overs and take those 2 points especially when it means 2 less points for KXIP.",7
"As good as we were, if it weren‚Äôt for some fielding errors and wides, this would‚Äôve been a sub-120 score",6
Sandeep: My strength is to back my strengths,20
Any guesses as to how many overs SRH will take to chase this? My guess : 13.2 overs,3
Friendship with Delhi Capitals ended. Hyderabad is my new best friend. (Because Sehwag backed Warner back in the day),9
"imo SRH and KXIP still look better units than KKR. Iyer somehow let Narine face Deshpande, Ashwin and Stoinis.",8
Haha doull with that hindi bit,4
man i was so excited for this game,5
"There are days when a bowling team gets opponent all out for low scores

I always prefer second because it gives confidence than relying on luck",8

Still pulling for Kings XI.",11
Couple of quick wickets at the top and the pressure is gonna be back on SRH,4
In before another 10 wicket win??,2
"With KKR winning earlier today and *assuming* SRH clinch this one, are any teams confirmed qualified or eliminated?",2
Did Pooran take it too deep?,7
Imagine we choke this,9
We are going from the most entertaining IPL weekend to the dullest IPL weekend,9
"70+ balls without a boundary, is it a record?",8
10 wicket win i predit.,3
Warner has 9 consecutive fifties against KXIP. Hoping he can make it 10 today!,8
Just as I was starting to like KXIP....,3

"Kxip fans, we were literally hounding spark XI fans for scoring 114 yesterday, we made like 12 runs more than them smh",19
Let's up that net run rate boiz,6
Do people not enjoy bowling? All these comments about snoozefests make me wonder if we are still watching the same game.,12
Impressed by Skipper Holder...such a boost to this SRh setup,18
"Needs wicket quick, Shami needs to open not Maxwell",6
"Good to know we aren't the only side who batted shit today, although was really rooting for a KXIP victory tonight",7
How do players speak fluent english while having an interview?,-1

"I felt suffocated watching that innings . How is SRH not in the top 4 , and kxip can you pull a magical win out of your ass please ?",12
I called this bullshit a [fortnight ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j6vpeu/5_stages_of_grief_as_a_kxip_fan/g81h834/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) ago,6
Doesn't seem to be batting pitch. But the score seems too less to defend. Few early wickets from shami can change it,7
Well at least I don't feel as bad about losing our match because Punjab might lose this one anyway,10
Dc bottling must have hurt kxip and they have lost all their will,7
"Pooran took it deep but never picked it up, sigh",7
"There is a reason Kumble is on his third franchise now. 

He was a part of the team management and had a mentor role with RCB, then MI. 

You gotta separate his cricketing achievements and insights from his coaching. 

I don't think he lasts beyond this season. I hope he returns to the dugout. He was great there last season.",16
Scenes if this game goes to super over as well...,11
Why can't the dugout stream switch to the main stream if they have no content during the innings break.,10
how bad is Kane's injury?,11
Rahul not wearing his orange cap against orange team,6
I feel chahal > Rashid atm.,-6
"Teams with mystery spinners like Rashid and Varun will be deadly at the end of the tournament with the pitches slowing down because now their variations will actually turn, hold up, and matter.",4

Neesham should play over Maxwell next match.,8
Yo wtf KL not wearing his orange cap?,7
"So if KX lose, are they out?",6
"Kane is a great batsman... but he has downright the worst fanboy-base. 

There I said it.",-16

I'd love to see wickets go flying in this innings. Often.,6

these two run so well,7

Good fucking ball. Shami is looking solid. Play him out boys.,9
Why is the commentator not talking about the battle between warner and shami??,6
ORGASM,4
"Gotta appreciate Vijay Shankar's fielding today. Man's putting his heart in it.

My Saturday evening ruined.  Its like the three super overs in one day sucked all the available excitement from the IPL.  None left.,5
No disrespect to Shami... He is bowling beautifully... But with less than a wicket per match with Economy of almost 9 are not good figure for any premium bowler,9

Classic KXIP. Even after winning against top 3 teams they've put up this shitshow,10
"Even if KXIP loses today, they are not out of contention for playoffs by any means. All they need is to win against KKR on Monday. Their last two matches are against RR and CSK which are the bottom 2 teams and they can sit on 14 points. Of course they still need either RR or CSK to beat KKR to keep them on 14 and if that happens KXIP will likely end up with better NRR. To get to 14, SRH needs to win 2 out 3 matches against DC, MI, RCB. If they do that, SRH will be deserving to be in playoffs and they will because they have the best NRR.",9

He was replacing jordan but he should have replaced maxwell because jordan can bowl in death overs if they don't want neesham to bowl there. Neesham could bowl in powerplay and finish his spell before 15th over. Also gowtham. He scored 42 in 2 games he was given, how did they just ignore his allrounder skills? Also a gun fielder.

Bowl Maxi you cowards.,9
Fuck the Josh app man,8
Seeing lord Shankar perform has motivated measly Warner to perform himself,6

"Unrealistic how Punjab has decent pace attack, smart spinners, elegant and powerful Batsmen but still struggling to teach top 4 in tables. I guess prolly a glue is missing to hold all that together.",3
Cmoom kxip,1
The FUCK!,4
Can‚Äôt wait until Kane gets better man. Bairstow has been so out of form,5
Scenes if Pandey & 3D get out,2
"There's a chance, there's a huuuuge chance",4
Yesssssss another super over today,3
Crumble time boys,7
That was on the cards. He had no clue which way it was spinning,2
Atrocious performance from Bairstow.,2
Lol that ball tracking looks suspect,2
only SRH,6
p a n i c,4
YES Finally,3
Replay of CSK v MI? Tell me about it,1
Samad is in.,1
Bairstow and getting bowled lmao,3
"Wait a minute, why is Samad in lmao",2
Bairstow is shit. You need more shit to drop him and bring in Kane!? FFS.,1
Ashwin is celebrating like he took SRH's last wicket.,2
"Nobody:

Ump: I fucking told you you bitch!",5
Bairstow finds a way to expose the wickets lol,7
üò≠,1
BC Lara lol,2
KXIP are pulling an SRH 2018,8
Ok it's getting interesting now.,3
Weak middle order exposed now.,2
Such a bad shot by Bairstow,1
Dayum boi,1
Good spell Ashwin he deserves this wicket. Bairstow looks clueless on legspin.,2
If only the target was 150+,6
"**7.2** Ashwin to Bairstow, OUT, **bowled round his legs** but this is more his doing than the bowler's. **58-2**

JM Bairstow  b Ashwin 19 (20b 4x4 0x6) SR: 95.00",2
We doing another collapse üò≠,3
Maybe Kane comes in for Bairstow when he is fit and saha as a specialist WK,5
Can we deport Bairstow and Stokes?,6
"Most of England limited overs batsman are flat track bullies, will struggle on slow and turning track",4
Hahaha. Oh well. This gonna be interesting now.,3
"Ffs. Srh. If you are planning to surprise me, this ain't a good day!",2
At least one Ashwin is having a good day out with the ball.,5
Samad before Shankar interestjng,3
[deleted],0
Dugout said ‚ÄúBC Lara‚Äù which turned on my *bhenchod* siren for some reason.,1
Common SRH just don't do a Mega ultra fuck up,8
Is that Samad walking in?,2
Damn how many have been clean bowled by this ashwin?,3
Is it a crime for Bairstow to get out in any other way than getting bowled?,5
"Okay ffs, get Williamson in now, this dude has failed for 5 matches straight",5
Yeah Bairstow is just an English Finch.,10
This match has turned bitches,2
"People who complained the match was boring, I blame you",2
"Comeon KXiP, u got this...keep attacc on",1
"There's still a lot of runs to play with still, relatively speaking, but Kings XI are just coasting. I don't get it. Okay nevermind, a wicket fell.",2
this samad guy looks interesting,2
Is there a twist?,2
Where is my guy Vijay? I had my 3D glasses on ffs,2
"Smh, bad evaulation of pitch by Coach and Rahul. Mujeeb on this pitch instead of Jordan. Would've been nasty",2
why did they send samad over 3D???,2
Williamson for Bairstow and Saha for Samad/Khaleel next game imo,4
Looks like a Day 5 pitch,5
"Can we pls drop Bairstow now? He has been horrific in the last 5 games. 

Let us bring in Kane or Nabi as a spinner and use Sreevats/Saha in place of Garg.",3
Rahul Don't fuck up by bowling maxi. Just let ashwin and bishnoi attack.,1
We should really just drop bairstow now. Just get Kane. Wickets are slowing down and you need the technically sound batsmen to control games,7
Samad sent to not let the RR go up quickly.,3
I'd say this is a nice gamble. Either hit or get out.,2
"Man, this M Ashwin guy has been a treat to watch today.",2
C'mon just get Pandey now and it'll be over,2
The Bairstow disappointment continues,5
YJB had no clue whatsoever against top quality spin.,6
"SRH looking for a NRR bump here , could prove costly",3
"Well good thing bairstow is gone, let the middle order finish the game like the previous one.",3
"Guys hear me out, Kagiso bats like Brian Lara",2
"R Ashwin: I sleep

M Ashwin: Real shit",6
What why samad so early,3
Bishnoi is ‚ù§Ô∏è,7
Considering tamil players are having a good day today may as well send in vijay shankar.,9
"Guys, So when they say that Kanos is injured or any other player is injured, are they actually so is it an acronym for benched ?",7
Murugan's googly spins like Murali's off spin,6
"Pandey needs to pull of the exactly same innings as before. Defend, defend, bad ball => stands",6
Bairstow is a team player. Makes sure that Kane gets a place in next match.,7
SRH could've been in a much better position if they had the balls to drop Bairstow and played Stanlake with Kane opening.,13
How do commentators tell a ball is googly or leg spin if it doesn't turn?,1
KL needs to find a way to block the singles here.,3
I think they don‚Äôt want to do what KXIP did with slowing down in the middle overs so I‚Äôm assuming samad is sent in with the instruction to hit,3
If Baristow is dropped who's going to keep & where would he bat explain that also,2
"For once, Pandey needs to play his TukTuk innings and not do anything stupid",6
"It‚Äôs so weird watching all these Kane fanboys rejoicing at Bairstow‚Äôs wicket there 

Disgusting",2
Bairstow made 104 runs from the last 95 bowls in the last 5 games. Pls drop him. The pitch is advantageous to spinners and Sreevats/Saha could handle them. Bring Saha/Sreevats in place of Bairstow and Kane/Nabi in place of Garg.,2
"Gg kxip,you guys have won the game.",2
"KKR won, Real won. It's been a fantastic day. Hoping Punjab lose now, better for KKR",-6
4 more overs of leg-spin to go.,5
Bairstow is lucky that rashid is in his team and not against him,9
"its literally less than run a ball, just keep your composure and get the 2 points lol",8
Braindead batting from jonny. Deserves to be dropped if kane is available,2
"I am sseing everybody commenting bout replacing bairstow with kanos.

then who tf will keep?",2
Would love to see bishnoi in blue along with chahal.,7
"If pitches were like this from first game, CSK would have dominated the IPL. Chawla, Tahir, Karn and Jadeja",2
Pandey and Holder all they have with Shankar seeming injured,4
"Bairstow: **exists**

Stumps: I'm in danger",9
Perfect score for pandeyji to chase,3
Noo Rahul! Stick with ravi!!,2
Drop Bairstow for Williamson surely?,6
This is good for SRH. Getting Shami in. Should have gone for Maxwell.,3
"True, buttler sucks against rashid.",1
Anyone from hyderabad here?,5
What happened to Shami :(,5
So tired of seeing this shitty fake Chintu Whitehat ad on Hotstar. Crazy that people are paying lakhs for this scam where you can find much better CS material online.,3
*Raat tak khelenge to inki fatt jayegi* intensifies,2
Shami? Lol. Shit captiancy again,5
So shami isn‚Äôt gonna bowl in the death?,3
Why take off spinners when they are creating pressure and taking wickets?,3
"Even KXIP bowls their strike bowler before the match is over.

*Please learn the stupid fucks at Delhi*",2
"spinners were doing a great job, wth Rahool",2
I wanna see Holder bat.,1
"If Kings XI can put the squeeze on here, as Sunrisers middle order is largely untested, we can be in for a pretty entertaining finish, as all Kings XI matches have been all season.",2
Spinners are bowling beautifully. Why bring shami now?,3
I think it's a good move by bringing Samad. He can absolutely tank a spinner. 1or 2 sixes and the match is almost done.,4
Shami has been disappointing today.,2
"Kane for Bairstow, Saha for Garg/Samad",2
Give me one of those beautiful 6s samad,3
SRH should definitely back Samad in coming seasons. Dude got a great finisher potential,7
"Swanny: Bairstow shouldn't be criticized for getting out against spin.

Binga: Why?

Swanny: it's a national problem. Every English player sucks against spin.",26
"My brain and sense thinks that SRH will win this surely.

My heart feels that KXIP will win today.

And I always listen to my heart do KXIP come on you can do this!!!",11
Why not Bishnoi? üòí,4
Pitches are getting slow which might be advantage SRH at this stage of the tournament.,7
This game is much harder to win from here than SRH fans are imagining,8
Bishnoi is not being used well at all.,2

Damn that catch.....don't give me hope,6
I called it earlier and people said we never bottled this easy chase,15

Samad had a horror of a day,8
"I'll give to KXIP and Rahul, fucking clutch captaincy thus far. This is how you try to defend a low total.",10

How does Swann do that? üòÇ,3
Great Fucking Catch!,4
Classic #SRHChoke imminent,6
Punjab is planning another heist. Their matches always turns out to be value for money,5
Bairstow and unsold Alex Hales Evin Lewis >> Williamson(in t20),-5
Oh how they'd love to have kane there now.,2
"Srh, surely u r not gonna choke right? Right???",5
Dumbest shot of the day.,3
Only our batting lineup could bottle this lol,14
Get Pandey and all the pressure is intensified,2
3d time?,7
"if we lose this, I'm cancelling my hotstar membership",18
I guess it is too early to write off KXIP üòÄ,1

It's alright guys. He probably was just following instructions to the dot. Just needs a bit more maturity in shot selection.,11
Is this game still alive,1
Yes Chokerising. Yes,1
"Come on SRH, you can't give up now. This is your match to win.",3

Y‚Äôall are obviously winning this SRH guys stop reverse jinxing it,7
is it that time of the week when it starts to rain superovers,1
They shouldn't have fucked with the winning combination of Pandeyji and 3D Shankar,7
This innings seems like SRH 2020 v. SRH 2016,11
WhY DiD He BoWl ShAmi?,10
"We're chasing: Panik

We've got a good start: Kalm

We've lost couple of quick wickets: Panik",26
"Slowly but surely, SRH fans are calling for every single one of their players to be dropped",12
I don‚Äôt care how old Zinta is but I‚Äôd bang the shit out of her ... if I get the chance,-4
"i think Samad was just trying to do what he was told, he was  sent in as a pinch hitter, unfortunately it didn't work..",3
I believe both Samad and Garg had sufficient opportunities but they could not do much. It's better to give chance to atleast one sitting youngster.,7
"Boring match: *exists*

KXIP: we don't do that here",64
"Samad is good against spinners and SRH sent him to hit the spinners out. 1 or 2 sixes were enough to put the match to rest. KL surprisingly bought on Shami for a 4th and won the small battle by picking up Samad. The catch was outstanding tho.  


People here were bashing KL for no reason. Also more often thought process behind a decision rather than the result should be criticized of a captain.",11
What a captaincy by KL Rahul giving a legit fight,11
LMAO KXIP drlivering as usual.. I was about to turn the match off when Warner/Bairstow were playing.. glad I didn't,5
Will there be a twist?,5
Can SRH win this convincingly lmao?,3
Good to see Punjab still having the belief that they can pull this one off.,5
I smell superover!!,2
"Atleast we‚Äôre in the top 4 in fair play 

*curles up and cries in the corner*",8
Punjab are still 20-25 runs short. It would have been a different game altogether. Still hoping they choke Sunrisers here and create panic,8
Pandey sus,4
Don't trust PandeyG. He played well last game but that was more of an anomaly.,2
"Perfect kind of chase of Pandey and Shankar. Come on Pandey, please show us that you aren't a one match wonder",8

"Shouldn't have bowled Shami out, why not bring in Maxwell during these middle overs? His bowling has been way more beneficial than his batting.",4

This is just absurd just to have extra ad this guys take strategic timeout in middle of a 8th over or just batting team takes it to recollect strategy?,3
Not ashamed to admit that BTS song is catchy as hell,1
If SRH make a meal out of this chase i wont be mad about the Delhi loss today,2
"Samads gotta go, shit fielder as well. Maybe nadeem in as a spinner.",3
KL really channeling his inner Rishabh today,2
Holy shit srh fans won't sleep until there are 11 wholesome‚Ñ¢ kanos in the team,11
Wait what Shami bowled out? Trusting Jordan too much today,5
Kane fanboys praying for SRH to be bowled out any time now,10
I wonder what happened to Ben Cutting. It was cuz of his innings RCB lost the finals against SRH?,9
I only like one version of Pandey. Aggressive Pandey. Other one sucks.,4
[deleted],3
Maxwell is the Highest paid cheerleader!,13
Shankar's batting feels like a mix of Azha and Srinath.,6
SRH should take this match deep. Even if the RR gets to 10 in the last 3 overs with Jordan bowling they should be able to get it,2
"Don't forget, SRH fans, that I, /u/vouwrfract, single-handedly [brought Manish Pandey back to form](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jfbk3a/match_thread_39th_match_kolkata_knight_riders_v/g9tdgb3/?context=10000).

"How tf is KXIP 67% there lol, SRH are definitely a lot more likely to make the playoffs, atleast after this match",13
Shankar can't afford to do what he did last game.  The pitch is slow and Manish didn't get into his groove yet.,7
I'm just glad that if KXIP lose they aren't losing this by a huge margin (which looked likely when Warner was batting).,2
Abey dono last match Yaad Karo..,8
Ngl while didn‚Äôt like punjabs batting i think they still got a fighting chance left,10
Shankar bout to do a half Tewatia by getting out without hitting,5
Happy birthday bitch,-3
Now I'm certain Vijay modelled his batting around Srinath's game. Weird choice but whatever works I guess.,1
Ngl but even shabnam is hot af.,4
"i know its all fun and games in this sub whenever Shankar aka 3D is involved in a game. 

I'm curious as to how many actually like him as a player. I think he's got a pretty solid defence and can also change gears (he did it pretty well in his DC days - now he seems to be more of a crisis man)

And not to forget he's a gun fielder.",8
"KXIP have shown plenty of fight in the second half of this season, which tbh I wasn‚Äôt expecting after winning only 1 game from 7",3
great fight from kxip. Atleast they are going down fighting unlike csk vs mi,4

Very interesting scenario here. Ashwin and Shankar are regulars for TN Ranji team. Pandey is captain of Ktk Ranji side. Both sides have a bit of rivalry going on. Shankar can spot Ashwin's variations off his hand. Will he help Pandey crack the mystery? ü§î,10
Only KXIP can take it to superover from here. Only when they're batting though. SRH have this,2

Shankar honestly not a bad bat when he does this whole ‚Äúpresent full bat to ball‚Äù thing. Yet manages to spectacularly shit the bed when in blue colors,3
3D is a badrinath kind of player. Both India and SRH used him in the wrong position till now. #5 is the perfect spot for him,7

these RO purifiers brings the TDS level of input water usually by 90% !!
also lot of water is wasted, usually 1:2..

WHO recommends atleast 150 TDS so that water has essential minerals..

Municipality waters are usually pre treated and have 100-200 TDS... so a non RO purifier would suffice.. running them through RO purifier makes the TDS level 0.. which is not at all good..

these RO purifiers ain't that cheap..",6

"Ok bear with we here, this is a needlessly complicated shitpost

So AB is Mr 360 right? But 360 means you're only hitting shots in one plane, or **2 dimensions** (some of you may now see where I'm going)

Therefore a 3D player such as Shankar, should be able to hit shots in all directions, at all elevations. 360x360 = 129,600 which is all the different degrees in a 3D space. But this would create a sphere of points, which the mathematicians among you may realise means that half the points would be underground in the context of a batsman in a cricket match, and even a god such as Vijay himself could not achieve that. So you do 129,600√∑2 = 64,800

Now it's also worth mentioning that quite a few of these points would basically be the equivalent of hitting the ball straight up in the air, making it likely to be caught, but they are still shots that a 3D player will be capable of nonetheless

I therefore suggest that we start referring to Vijay Shankar as Mr 64,800

Gayle with the 'why am I here?' facial expressions.,6
"If you can't get him out, hit him... Looked nasty",3
Jesus Christ man. Don‚Äôt tell me where gonna get fucked by injuries once again.,18
Fuck that's bad,8
Shit,6
That's gonna hurt man.,4
"Holy fuck, miles away from the stumps that damn",0
Fuck these injuries.,3
"Bounced and straight into the side of the grill

Ouch but better the grill than the helmet itself ig",2
"Man both teams showing killer intent today, whatever the result, SRH and KXIP have played like they want this bad",19
Ughhh,2
KXIP just beating the shit out of the opposition now?,15
This will make him even more focussed. What have you done Punjab,4
Ah fuck that's nasty,2
They have literally taken him out!,3
Always wear a helmet even while playing a spinner.,18
I hope he is ok,3
If he plays on he's winning it in 5 balls tops,3
Nasty hit wtf... Give him a red card ref!,6
biggest blow to 3d since avatar 2 was delayed,10
Shankar is perennially in the way of injury :(,2
Imagine if he had no helmet,3
Punjab trying new tactics to win,3
Till last over he was playing without a helmet . Imagine if he got hit then .,14
"Now THIS is 3D defending! If you can't get them out, **PUT** them out!",3
Shankar is made of steel man. How is he standing up,6
Ball on ball,1
"Imagine we have changed rules.. instead of hitting wickets, fielders have to hit batsmen for the runouts",6
This is going to the super over again isn't it,6
Let him bat. Angry Shankar ‚ÄúThandav‚Äù mode activated,4
Reminds me of KXIP chase vs RCB going to the last ball earlier in the tourney,2
KXIP going to defend this surely!,2
"Total accident, ball bounced. Feel bad for Shankar tho",3
Shankar is steel don't worry bois,4
Oh shitt.....!!!!,1
Do we have concussion subs in the IPL?,5
Take him off and get him tested if in doubt. No point risking a career for this match.,9
"even if we win... our next 3 matches are against MI, RCB and DC. Oooof",12
Imagine if he had no helmet vs a Spinner,8
Game is ending in 10 balls now,2
"This is why players run in curved lines when there is a throw. 

First instinct is survival and then comes the wicket.",8
He wasn't playing with helmet against spinners that would have such catastrophic,18
Pandey wasted 10-15 balls here,5
WTF Maxwell threw it like he was outside the boundary,3
And that kids is why I wear a helmet for even spinners,6
"Game's still going on?

Reminds me of mi vs rps 2017 finals",7
"KXIP be like ""If you cannot run then out, then hit them out""",12
"For the few geniuses asking constantly about how they've struggled so much in a chase of 127

If virtually everyone struggles to score, maybe it's just a tough batting pitch? Both teams did well in the powerplay when the ball was hard and really struggled as the ball got soft. You've got brains, fucking use them",15
Just watching that made me poss my pants ..forget about actually getting hit like that. Kudos to all the athletes out there - massive respect.,10
WOW,9
Holy smokes games on,8
What a game,5
Every team except MI have been a meme team.,8
Viju gone üòÆ,4
Oh fuck,4
Arshadeep got him with a cheeky one,4
His head got shocked.... He cant help it....,8
Match on ooooooooof,3
I swear if we bottle this,7
KXIP: I wish we were chasing to win this,3
What an infiniteD move by Punjab.. Lmao,7
p(‚ï¨ √í ‚Ä∏ √ì)q,2
"Well well well, It's down to Rashid Khan with the bat as well now",5
HERE WE GO AGAIN lmao.. i swear KXIP matches always deliver,6
3D^gone,2
Fuxxxxxk,2
I swear if we loose this,6
Punjab knows they can win because they've lost from this stage,8
Super over or is it too soon to call,3
Yesssssssss super over babbbyyyy,2
More Haryanvi than punjab that hit,3
I slept through that snoozefest and woke up to this. Game onnn,1
Ugh as much as I want KXIP to win I really feel bad for Shankar there,10
Fuuuuuuck,2
"If Pooran direct hit that, I feel that's game",2
"Wtf, don't give me hope",6
Game is still alive!,4
LMAO... This is gold for a neutral observer!,3
CSK may not be the worst team of the tournament,7
"I guess thats why players should have helmets on, even while facing spinners, OUCH",8
It was a good ball but I wonder if being hit had an impact on the way Shankar played that,2
Sanga with the puns,1
This is exactly why I don‚Äôt like batsmen removing helmets when spinners come on. Bowlers are not the only ones that can hit you in the head.,14
More ads on the way bois,1
SRH more like SMH,5
There's still Garg and Rashid,2
Man... he was hurting so much... didn‚Äôt know what shot to play. Feel for him...,6
fuck me,1
Ahh I feel bad for Shankar. He‚Äôs probably still shaken and he fought hard,8
So it is a slow pitch,1
"Ah fuck no Mr 64,800",2
"ah sh*t ... here we go again.. 
just KXIP things..",5
What in the fuck of my fucking fuckster fuck.,6
Indian batsmen and getting in awkward position to short ball. üòí,3
Feel bad for shankar..,4
Pooran deserves an assist for this wicket..,5
Shankar : Here's a little lesson in 3D-ickery,1
"Well well well, another twist in tail and the match is truly on.",2
Rashid Khan's going to get SRH over the line he always does,1
ooooooooooofffff,1
"Bruh saying it again , kxip providing peak entertainment",8
This is classic SRH innings lmao,1
"Holy shit!!

If they manage to fuck this up, I am blaming Pandey!",0
Love me some low score thrillers,3
Feel bad for shankar. He looks rattled..the replay was ugly,11
Jason Holder is still there.,4
This is interesting now,1
I wouldve honestly sent in Rashid but big ups Garg pls come through,5
Well played buddy. Go get some rest.,9
Garg to finish it ?,1
I should buy a helmet,1
Kharar Express Arshdeep,3
SRH surely aren't going to lose this. *Right*,2
I am pretty sure 3D is out of this tournament from concussion. These injuries flair up next day and makes you dizzy and shit. Really bad injury.,2
Bad bounce from the throw shook him up. He is one that bats without a helmet when facing a spinner so he might change that now.,4
Pandey this is what happens when you play like a selfish cunt taking up 25%(!!) of the overs to score 15 runs. Fucking waste of space,3
"**17.5** Arshdeep Singh to Shankar, OUT, **he's got him!** Arshdeep's strangle has resulted in an edge. Rolls the fingers on this. Remember, he's around the wicket. So the short of length ball is into Shankar's body. Shankar is walking down into the leg side to try and open the face and get this through backward point and short third man. He gets a thin outside edge to Rahul **110-5**

V Shankar c &dagger;Rahul b Arshdeep Singh 26 (27b 4x4 0x6) SR: 96.29",1
SRH doing a KXIP against KXIP,7
KL clearly the type of captain that let's emotions show... Not saying it's a bad thing,2
WHAT THE FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUKKKKKK,1
welcome to the club SRH,1
"Man. What a team. I know we're losing this really badly, and we batted shite but this team makes matches so interesting... I love it.",3
"Pooran definitely dangerous for other players 
 
Last time it was Mayank and now Shankar",9
They always make the game close .love it,3
Tactical throw by Pooran!,4
Only SRH can do this,3
Warner is gonna smash his Oled Tv man.,2
Is that Mithila Palkar on that Josh Ad?,3
"How did both teams have such electrifying powerplays, yet end up here?!",5
S U P E R O V E R,3
Dirty cricket mate.,1
What‚Äôs with downvote trend today?,-1
KXIP wanted themselves to bat to win this,2
"Absolutely disgraceful by Doull(?) 

After Shankar got out, ""He can have a (concussion) Test now",11
Everyone has got a wicket now,3
Could have brought in Kane?,2
This would be such a perfect time to bring on Nabi...,6
"no worries no worries,  we have Rashid Bhai",3
Please don't do that. Don't give me hope. Saying this for the umpteenth time this IPL.,11
Garg only hits behind the wicket!,0
These two fucked the entire game and got out at the end. gg,2
Can't blame Shankar for that....hope he's okay!,6
Pooran 3d thinking with West Indies aggression took out Shankar for KXIP,7
Am I the only one who was cheering for Shankar despite wanting KXIP to win,7
Fuck-up coming up,0
Yooo why did holder come out before Garg?,1
"Bring on the superover bois, it's weekend after all.",6
Pls no more super over. I am bored of that shit,5
I pray to god for Jordan not fucking it up,7
Writer handling kxip matches need to become IPL head writer,7
I FUCKING LOVE PUNJAB,6
"Cj, do it man please .....",2
"There should be a ""Most Entertaing Team"" award and be given to KXIP, their matches have been so fun for neutral viewers even more so",9
17 off 12.. jesus.. if Jordan balls a 3-4 run over here this match is on.. as of now still SRH game to lose,2
Ah yes the classic SRH bottle. It's my fault I got my hopes up after our match against RR,5
Gotta feel bad for 3D,4
"KL smiling like ""Hey, this is fun when we are the ones doing the choking and not the ones being choked""",10
Wait Manish Pandey had a strike rate of 50 ?,3
"KXIP: we r fked target is just 127
SRH: hold my middle order",5
Fuck please no superover,2
Wearing helmet should be made compulsory for a batsman. Even if a spinner is bowling.. doesn't matter.,3
Holder let me see your big hitting abilities,3
I'm not an expert on SRH's youngsters but doesn't Garg at 3/4 and Samad at 7 make more sense than this way round?,5
"Players show a wee bit of humanity

Paytm: 5 fair play points to Gryffindor",11
Shankar and Pandey better get seriously told off for that partnership.,5
"Wrong move, Rashid should've come to bat.",9
"Scorecard:



Vijay Shankar    hit on head by-Nicholas Pooran26  (27)",7
"If Shami had an over left, SRH would have been screwed",10
Holder said no because he doesn't want to get hit again.,2
"Punjab lost all matches early in the last 3 overs.

Is it time they win some in the last 3 overs?",7
Kxip hired Abbas Mastan for their scripts this ipl,12
1 more wicket pls,3
Fucking white hat junior fuck off cringe,5
Battle of the chokers,2
We just don't have a t20 batsman after the top 2.,1
Send out Rashid and his fucking bizarre 'let me just flick you awkwardly over square leg for 6' technique,9
Why am I not nervous. Maybe because of Holder.,9
Round table conference,2
"Batting slowly because the asking  rate in control is one thing, scoring 15 off 29 is another thing entirely. He just needed to bat at fucking run a ball, everyone else is doing that across both teams easily and Warner gave us a massive cushion and he ate that completely and then took a massive shit and then got out.",11
Kxip having an emergency meeting,7
My day is ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable,19
Pandey is the most polarising player this season,6
KXIP is gonna fuck it up.,3
Why is Rashid not Batting now?,7
"If KXIP win this from the position they were,

I'll switch the only flair I've ever  had to Kochi Tuskers forever.",22
Srh trying so hard  to lose,6
"Kxip and nail-bitting finishes,name a better duo",6
Super over night!,1
"If SRH lose this then you should just scrap that money you're burning on Pandey, take his passport away, use that 1.6M USD to help migrant labourers and leave Pandey there to work as one because he clearly doesn't belong on a pitch",6
JORDAN?,1
This is sports entertainment bitches : vince mcmahon,4
Not Jordan ffs.,1
Man I love KXIP. They had the best matches this year.,7
"Dayum, Dugout is roasting Maxi.",1
wow csk not on top for once,-1
First ball would be a wide.,5
I think Srh may just win if they outscore kxip,7
POORAN did some real 4D thinking there with that throw,10
"Aight Jordan

Mandatory wide this over",2
"What‚Äôs with so many Indians with the name Deep?

I have one fella working with me... called Ball-deep. Boy is it fun when we call him to the office",3
"As a neutral this has been an entertaining match, KXIP always delivers",6
"Holder vs Jordan

2 runs 2 wickets",3
"I‚Äôm like 20% confident SRH manage this win, this lower order is too nervy",7
Khaleel with the OP SR,6

Dugout is smoking nehra's sasta nasha. They want length balls now üôÑ,3

Is Arshdeep bowling the last over?,1
Jordan will take holder,1
Have some faith in jordan guys..,3
"Punjab winning here will actually be better here, coz SRH will most probably lose their next 3 games against the Top 3 anyway, Punjab can at least use these 2 points to qualify",6
"Say whatever you want to say about punjab, but their games were most entertaining so far in the IPL.",5
MI beat RCB in champions league final defending 140 odd when Rcb were 40 in 4 for no wickets with rampaging Dilshan and Gayle,2
Oh god is Arshdeep gonna bowl if it gets to the last over?,3
"ladkhada rahi hai, antim sans lerahi hai - match in a nutshell",5
Is KXIP doing the reverse of what they did during the first part? Snatch victory from defeats,9
I have forgotten what a tight IPL game feels like. Very one sided the last week more or less.,5
This is turning into MI v RPS 2017 final,5
KXIP doing to SRH what SRH bowling did to everyone couple of years ago,7
Im starting to hate hotstar. Starts buffering during the last few overs of every game fuckfkaskkda,8
Seriously though ... 5 wickets left. Just swing. All they need is a couple of good connects,6
Rabada looks like a super hero and Jordan a super villain from the Marvel universe,3
what the fuck is this over rate - abysmal,7
Pune warriors is the worst IPL franchise of all time,7
"Holder gotta win this

Edit: Arrrrtrggggghhhhhhh",4
IPL scriptwriter urgent call worked!!,2
10+ runs in last over should be tasty,3
CMON JASON JUST 1 SIX SEALS THE DEAL,2
Is Vijay Shankar ok? Will he be able to play next game,5
146kmph shitttt Jordan has some pacee,0
One six Holder please!!!,2
SRH chasing this like the computer opponent in Real Cricket '19,5
That one could've been a boundary if it was Rashid,5
Why are Kings XI wearing a black armband? Edit: Thanks everyone.,5
Who are the writers of this game?? GOT's D&D?,2

"How the fuck this contest become this close.. Skipped watching when the scorecard read 56 in 6 overs, Warner was going BONK BONK all over!!!",4
Big win coming up for punjab,-1
And that's game probably,1
Warner sees his win slipping away...,2
Jordan got his Haqq,3
No fucking way. This can‚Äôt possibly be true. Lmao,3
SRH... Never change please lol,3
For fuck sake,3
Kings XI confirmed meme team,5
We need to close down these singles,3

Good swift catch too Mandeep,1
SRH is the underdog meme team.,5
"This is stupid!!

YRKFA save them.",3
Williamson would have been a better choice over holder,3
SRH has been pulling off low scoring thrillers for so long. They have been on the receiving end for a change. Kings make every match interesting. Truly an RCB spirit.,4
"Rashid about to show why he‚Äôs the true 3D king (pls)

Edit: /r/agedlikemilk",3
"This is 1st leg roles reversed here lol, srh doing a kxip",2
Jordan's last two balls were bowled at 146 and 144 resp. Latter one earning him a wicket. He's done well today.,4
warner_reaction.gif pls,1
That‚Äôs why when u r at the top u need to drive it in. Shankar and Pandey batted too slow and let it meander .,1
Ah fuck not rashid lol,2
Samad was a waste of wicket,1
Chad Rashid,1
I hope scriptwriters get some Oscar this year. At least filmfare.,1
Man I went out after the power play thinking the game was practically over. Just came back. This KXIP has some knack of making games interesting.,1

"Withdraw the fucking team. I am really tired this season. 

Dont care anymore. 

How can you suck so hard at chasing? Almost everytime.",2
Jordan to Holder : 3 matches 3 OUT,2

Test elitists where are you???,3
"If kxip wins this, u have my thnx

"We don't deserve the playoff spot. 

Somebody please take it.",9

Chakk de phatte!!!!,10
Where are SRH flairs now?,3

17-7 lol,7
Half assed running.,3

Khaleel did a Pandya and Sehwag.,4
Didn't watch the match. How tf did 5 wickets drop in 3 overs?!,5
Woohoo!,1
Pandey's innings will go down as one of the most atrocious in IPL if not t20 history,12
That sets up a cracker on Monday - KKR vs KXIP,11
Don't forget the spin web of Bishnoi and Ashwin. That kept them in the game üòé,9

So is SRH out?,3
This is not 2016 or 2018 it's fkin 2013,6
"A win against KKR on Monday will seal KXIP's playoff spot. Because that'll put both KXIP and KKR on 12 points, and KXIP have a better run rate. Plus both KXIP and KKR play CSK and RR in their last 2 games, so they are gonna win anyway. Both end up with 16 points, KXIP beating KKR on NRR",6

LMAO Lord Khaleel,7
Fuck me! the scriptwriters this year keep on giving.,6
Khaleel is so weird man,6
No way this SRH team deserves a spot in the playoffs. They should be languishing right there with CSK at the bottom of the table.,4
2020 playing its black magic on the hearts of loyal supporters,3
Khaleel runs faster when he gets a batsman to glove one down the leg side.,4
Srh went 14-7. Even RCB/CSK/KKR DIDNT COME CLOSE.,14

"RCB is propping up Southern India right now in the IPL. The less said about the other two teams, the better.",9
SRH seriously needs to get rid of Khaleel. Might be a wicket taker at times but has absolutely no cricketing sense and game awareness. Have to get a solid indian middle order bat and a finisher please. This is absolute garbage considering we were cruising at one stage.,11
Gayle you lucky mascot,21
Anyone who criticizes Shankar will face my wrath. SRH fans totally changed my mind after I criticized his ~~rubbish~~ amazing innings in the last match. Now I'm one of them.,11

KXIP are the hottest team in the IPL rn. Yes, there I said it !",14
"Looks like I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reverse jinxing lately

1) I said Washington would keep Gayle quiet - Gayle hits him for 4 sixes 

2) I said Siraj would get destroyed against KKR - wins man of the match 

3) I said SRH we‚Äôre finished when they lost openers against Rajasthan - they chase down the target 

4) I said RIP Punjab when they were 88-5 and they won by 12 runs

Ohhhh well the best part of the match was Khalil showing his defending techniques when 13 were needed of 3,8

Its Pandey who shouldve done better.",26

What an embarassment. I honestly expected better from SRH. They can't expect Warner or Pandey to guide them to victory in every single match.,17
Guys Arshdeep is the Harmeet of 2020. Deccan won the IPL with Harmeet as the death bowler.,17
Khaleel's not to be blamed but his batting was pure comedy.,12
Manish Pandey is a fraud.,16
Really happy for KXIP. They r scripting the best turn around story of their lives.,16
"Wtf i missed everything, op bowling or extraordinary choking?",5
Lol... Can't believe khaleel actually played for India!! Atrocious attitude!!!,17
How the fuck did rr manage to lose against Srh,12
Kanos wouldn't let this happen. Never.,12
Man if they don‚Äôt give MoM to Arshdeep or Jordan we riot,19

Even though I'm happy for Punjab. Now I'm just shit scared of them and don't want RCB to encounter them in playoffs.,17

So is no one here gonna compliment captaincy from KL?,20

"Man the tail was so horrible. Not a single shot could even clear the inner circle. They can't hit for shit, all the way from 4 down

U are at 15(28)*. The team need about 6-7 runs a over. Why on earth would u go fo a lofted shot. What a hack,14
Khaleel should be removed from the team as punishment for that lazy ass run on the second last ball. Absolutely disgusting behaviour from the man.,14

Just put me out of my misery please,18
I said before that Gayle will have a transformative effect on Punjab. So far I have been proven right. 4 wins from 4. Now they just need to get rid of Maxwell and play a foreign bowler and they‚Äôll be good to go. Mandeep can slot in for KXIP in middle order,20

"Brilliant win for KXIP after they looked dead in the water after 6 overs. Wicket was slow but it was terrible effort from middle order. But Warner or Bairstow or Pandey should have taken responsibility to bat through the innings and failed to do so. 

After this game it looks like KKR vs KXIP for 4th place and KXIP can take destiny in their control by beating KKR in the next game. if they lose then KKR are through. If they win it could still come to NRR if both teams win remaining games. Still it could be really exciting final week of IPL before play offs.",9

But why do you want him to be picked up by us again for a lower amount. It's less about the amount and more about his intent in last 3 years. Surely we'll get someone better for 4 cr or someone best for 11cr for that matter.,4
"In the celebrations of the win, people are forgetting the [poor batting](https://i.imgur.com/GKfno49.jpg) performance of KXIP.

Thank you Kings XI Punjab!!! Live to fight another day. This is prime and premium entertainment from this team all season. That KKR clash is gonna be pretty spicy. That was some turnaround with the ball in hand. Wow!,25
