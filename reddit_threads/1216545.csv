"Statisticians help me out please. What should an RCB fan want from this game? 

My maths suggests to me we just need it to be really close for NRR purposes",2
Ruturaj and Faf get the boys in yellow home.. PLEASE.,7
r/cricket vs rr,3
"If KXIP lose the current game, RR win this one and SRH lose on Tuesday, it wouldn't be the first time for RR to sneak into playoffs with the help of other teams. They have weird luck like that.",6
"RR needs to win by 60 runs to secure their playoffs spot, KKR needs to win by 84 runs to do the same, And if both of them fail to do that, still the winning team will qualify if one of the RCB or DC loses badly ior SRH losing the last match..

IF kxip Loses",14
RR to win,2
That's another maximum powered by #sextillion7thpower,1
"The one team that scares me, as a RR fan, is KKR. They seem to absolutely dominate us especially in recent years.",4
"KKHaar please show up, pretty please.",2
"both RR and KKR is 

Win To Qualify

Lose to Get Wooden Spoon.


This is the weirdest ipl i have ever seen Bruh",6
KKR could have chased any target with peak Lynn Narine. Remember that time they made 120 in the powerplay vs RCB? KKR should unironically open with Russell if he plays and they‚Äôre chasing,5
"Whosoever wins, I just wish Uthappa scores atleast a 50 today. I am not his fan but he's been a good batsman and he doesn't deserve the disrespect some people show. 

-- IPL 2014 Orange Cap winner 

-- Ranji Trophy 2014-15 Highest Run scorer 

He's been fairly consistent since the 2010 season when he scored a 21 ball 50. Only the last 2 seasons have been bad.",8
"I have a feeling, the only way we‚Äôre winning this is if we‚Äôre chasing...",3
"If CSK wins, RR needs to win by 60 runs(or equivalent if chasing) to ensure a better run rate than the loser of RCB vs DC (even if they lose in super over). Otherwise qualification will depend on SRH vs MI. 
I did the M A T H",4
KKR need that Yusuf Pathan who smashed SRH in 2014 today,5
The only way we are going into playoffs is to win the game today and then pray for a MI win against SRH.,3
"What should be the strategy of the team batting second? Just try to win the game and depend on SRH vs MI game or try to win it by a big margin to get close to DC and RCB on NRR?
Surely RR can pull it off but only if they bat second.",3

Andre In. Mavi In for KKR,2
RR has won the toss & KKR has won the wooden spoon,50
"this is it for this year guys, see you next year for another disappointing performance",7
"With everyone thinking that we might have this,  making me feel uneasy",5
Lol half of the match is decided at the toss itself and even more so today bcz the team batting first has no well in hell a chance to get close to DC and RCB on NRR.,4
Go get it Rajasthan!,4
Fingers crossed for my Royals,6
"Come on Royals, Qualify",5
It's fucked that the toss alone shifts chances of winning so much but man I am happy for RR.,4
Never thought I‚Äôd ever be supporting KKR wholeheartedly but here we are. Let‚Äôs goooo KKR!!!!!,5
Does the number of overs to chase in depends on KKRs score?,3
"Lol I have to support KKR today with their braindead decision of dropping Lockie, you should have dropped Narine.",3
"RR is chasing. 

FUCKK YEAH!!!!!",7

"Great to see that RR has stick with Aaron, hopefully he balls well today",3
How many times have we batted first? Jeez *angry Face*,1
"I back RR to chase this in 12.3 overs unironically, unless it‚Äôs a 200+ score",3
"If we lose this, we'll be 8th in the table.

Stop, I'm already dead.",2
Aaron bowled a lot of dot bowls glad they didn't ho back to unadkat,2
With the amount of people thinking RR is going to win now I'm scared! üò¨ Pls no jinxes üôè,6
"Kkr FTW

Plzzz, we'll lose if rr comes to playoff",2
Very excited for yet another umpiring controversy,2
"Win toss and win matches with dew on... Toss is so critical, unless KKR posts 220+ tough to defend with likes of RR lineup. to be fair it looks as scary as MI lineup or better",1
Dhoni is playing IPL 2021? Congratulations CSK.,1
KKR can qualify or finish last based on how this match goes,1
"Winner has a shot at playoff, and loser will probably end up last on the points table

Let that sink in.",4
This is one of those KKR matches where they defend a low score isn't it.,1
"For making it to the playoffs, winner of this match will be supporting MI to beat SRH on Tuesday!",1
"If RR wins today:

KKR from a strong 4th position to wooden spoon, all in a single week xD",6
 Lockie out?! Russell In!,1
Shubman Gill and Morgan to score heavy. KKR will post 185. RR will lose by 10 runs.,0
CSK and KXIP fans whom are you rooting for now?,3
Don't care who qualifies now as the bandwagon XI Punjab is out. Some bandwagon comments such as *My team is MI but I want KXIP to win the trophy this year* made me cringe.,8
"So how one sided this game should be to have an influence on Runrate to replace loser of RCB and Delhi, provided tomorrow match end closely",3
Well this match is officially alive...,3
KKR please win the match. You have full support from MI fans.,18
This is a knockout match.Isn't it?,3
I was wondering who will be the next Joseph Alzarri. Turns out it was Lockie Ferguson.,3
"Oh wow. Another toss loss for KKR. Argh, RR wins this right? :(",3
"HallaBol. C'mon RR, LET'S DO THIS",2
How quickly does RR need to chase to overtake DC/RCB's NRR?,5
So let me guess KKR to score 300 and RR to chase it down in 10 overs. Mom:  Stokes 200,5
I hope RR wins cos FUCK KKR,2
Full support to KKR today,4
So KKR could jump from 8th to 2nd if they win by 100+ runs?? What a season,5
What should happen for CSK to not finish last?,1
"Same prediction again:

If kkr wins toss and bats second then they will the match",0
As a RCB fan i hope this is very close match so the NRR remains same.,3
Kkr loses then wooden spoon!!!!!!!!! Wtf this year was not that bad,2
"Win margin for the two teams to go past RCB and DC in the net run rate 

RR \~37 balls left 

KKR \~79 runs

Courtesy: Cricbuzz",8
"No shame in being dropped for _Andre Russell_ of course, but on the other hand Ferguson must be wondering exactly what  more he could possibly do!",2
"While it makes sense to chase cause of dew, isn't it easier to win by 60 runs than chase in less than 15 overs?",2
KKR will pull this off. RR wont be able to chase under such pressure and KKR bowling is strong,6
Royals chose to field THANK FUCK SMUDGE,5
Want Morgan to open against Archer.,2
"Win toss, bat second, win match.",1
Really hoping that Russell is fresh and has a big appetite after that rest.,5
"Russels muscles are fake, you heard it here first",2
Can't wait to see KKR's shit show strategy.,0
So now top 3  teams fixed in top 4?,1
RR won the toss and decided to give wooden spoon to KKR,0
So CSK avoiding wooden spoon confirmed?,1
"I think the order should be 

Gill, Rana, Tripathi, Morgan, Narine, DK, Russell, Cummins",3
I am scared of what Andre Russell might do.,5

"I'm all in for RR today, even if we make in for playoffs and lose for RR, I wouldn't feel much bad cause RR is the only team that can dominate MI",4
Go RR,1
KKR batting first = C O L L A P S E,7
Hoping for the Royals to win this.,1
"Oh no..oh no...oh nooooooooooooo  

Not Russelllll :(",5
"Still waiting for the dreruss special this year,  hope this is it",5
KKR Management has got to be very stupid. You are dropping an in form Lockie Ferguson for Andre Russell who has not done well with bat and ball,4
Bye bye KKR. You deserve your 8th spot.,-3
Captain Morgan vs All of his England teammates,94
"Just hope the match is a one sided affair, and winners gets a huge NRR boost to make things more interesting.

GO KKR. It's Korbo Lorbo Jeetbo Re Time.,3
Need a KKR win today by a very small margin.,0
KKR ü§û,1
Who should srh fans support here,1
KKR either needs to collapse at 120 or go big At 180-200. Nothing in between pls :),8
"Steve Smith vs Eoin Morgan.

Australia vs England.

RR vs KKR",9
Today's result really depends on whether KKR's batting unit from the DC game shows up or whether the one from the RCB game shows up.,4

All set to get hurt for the one last time,0
Please win RR. KKR deserves to be last,-3
Does the number of overs to chase in depends upon KKRs total to get our NRR ahead of RCB & DC? Or it stays the same?,3
OH Hells yeah. RUSSELL is back!!!,5

Gill  70 off 60 pls,2

It has been a while since we last had a super over. Today looks like a good day for one.,1

Why would you review this bruh lol,14
Why waste the review you dense fuck,10
So good at taking early wickets. Test match dismissal.,5

Just play Rana in alternate matches,3

Do you think RR and KKR will go all guns blazing knowing even a win will take them to playoffs if SRH lose.,1
Archer LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO,5
Why did he go for the review tho? That makes no sense...,6

Why would you even review that ?,2
"As an England supporter this game is hard to watch, I hate a sad Eoin Morgan",8
What's the point of taking DRS. Even a blind person know this is out.,2
That was a waste of a review. Could hurt KKR later on.,6
"**0.2** Archer to Rana, OUT, golden duck for Rana. Oh hang on. He has reviewed with one second to go. That is strange. This is not an lbw decision, but a catch at the wicket. It shouldn't take you 14 seconds to make up your mind on these. Archer has dug this in short, gets it chest high, and the Snicko shows there is a scratch as this goes past his fend. Rana, and the review, both gone **1-1**

N Rana c &dagger;Samson b Archer 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",4

If a KKR have a howler going against them..they deserve it,1
Jofra 1 over 1 Wicket Archer,3
Okay so guys hear me. To go above RCB's NRR RR has to win within 13.5 overs and KKR need to win by 79 runs,2
Archer you beauty,5

KKR losing the review on the first over is gonna cost them...seeing the finger go up and cant do anything but walk to pavillion...also note how shitty the umpires are in IPL...its gonna be tough,4
Ridiculous bowler,5
"If I were Captain of KKR, I would be absolutely livid with RANA",4
RR gonna appeal the shit out of everything now,4
wtf another golden duck,3
I want rr's nrr to improve enough that the loser of rcb vs dd gets knocked out,2
Now watch as questionable decision from the umpire will come up and there won't be any review left,1
I know eoins bummed about kkr. But seeing jofra preforming for RR must bring him some happiness. Especially with the upcoming worldcup.,5
"Rana‚Äôs form is such a meme atm. Golden duck, big score, golden duck, big score, golden duck.",9
Kkr looks like they‚Äôll bundle under 130... RR needs to get there in 12-13 overs.. game on,4
Archer is bloody unplayable,16
"This isn't swing, its fucking spinning",4
Did KKR lose their review? Just tuned in,2
"KKR have batted first in all of the last 6 occasions.

They only managed to successfully defend it once (against DC). 
And now, we are up against a team that has chased 180+ scores against teams like MI and KXIP.

Yeah KKR is losing this. Feels bad man :(,3
They are happy it wasn't a wide,2

Super doubt SRH will win against MI. This is basically just  Eliminator 2.,2
"How was that not a wide, again?",1
How Archer generates 145+ pace is beyond me. Dude looks like he has the laziest bowling action.,4

Why not make Butler keep ?,1
I hope other RR bowlers step up today.,2
WTF. Why was that not a wide?,2
Rana doesn't play high pace very well. Braindead management to send him to open when they have Tripathi.,2
Sooo now KKR have no review for the entire game? Gg lads,3
KKR ü§ù fucking up the power play,8
Great over for Archer. Time for the other 2 seamers to fuck it all up,5

Lord Aaron is here,3

Is it 15 overs or 13.5 overs for RR to overtake DC NRR?,1
"Everybody in the KKR dugout thinking please don't get out, I don't want to come to bat to face Joffra now.",3

I celebrate Archer‚Äôs first over *every* damn time and always forget the other bowlers are going to come and chuck pies...,6
Thank god we have Varun to restore some balance into the game,5
"I just want to watch a nail biting exciting match, whoever wins today",1
We desperately need a good bowler to help archer.,4
"RR has to chase in 13.2/13.5 assuming RCB & DC match lose by 1 run. But likely the match will have a little wider result. So instead of losing trying to go for it in 13 overs, RR should try to go for it in 15 overs, is what the cricinfo comment meant.


Of course if SRH loses, it wont matter.",7
Gill we were promised tuk tuk,8
Are yar kya yar kyu yar,1
"Hopefully Gill plays out Archer‚Äôs overs, he seems to be doing well, wouldn‚Äôt want him to get out",4
Has anyone been a better bowler than archer this ipl?,3
Rooting for RR for Stokes and Buttler and SRH for Williamson now.,4
Said at the halfway stage that KKR would finish last. Worst team in the IPL by far.,1
"I still remember that, last season, Gill had got bowled out to an almost unplayable banana swinging delivery from Varun Aaron.",4
Imagine if Aaron had a brain to go with his speed.,7
Archer taketh Aaron giveth,18
"Rana took ""Go big or go home"" quite seriously",3
Varun Aaron looks like what you would get if you combined the faces of bumrah and umesh yadhav,4

So whoever wins this game is up against SRH for the 4th spot? And if SRH wins against MI they're in no matter what?,1
"If RR had a decent bowler to complement Archer, they would have been in a far better position.",4
Isn‚Äôt the loser of this game certain to finish in 8th?,2
Tripathi has one 80 odd and a few 20s to his name disappointing performance tbh,2
Archer breathing fire,5
There is no hope for KKR trying to win by big margin. There only hope is winning the match and hoping that SRH lose. That way they go in.,3
We need to give respect to archer and target other bowlers,3
royals fast bowling is archer + steaming dog shit,3
Literally Jofra vs KKR atm,2
"KKR better make 240+, or get your ass scoped",4
Poor Tripathi. Joffra is bowling some fireballs.,1
Varun Aaron is what you get when you order a Jofra Archer off that Wish thing on Facebook,4
I'm sorry Tripathi that you had to go through this,1
"Dugout: Keeps clicking Wicket Alert when Jofra is on

Me: I want 6 sixers just to shit on this level of ""taken for granted""",1

Which team should srh support?,4
Tripathi making up for Gill's hitting.,1
Mussel is back,1
Morgan padded up üëÄ,1
Whoever told Archer to not bowl a single slow ball good job,2
So whatever KKR scores RR would have to chase it down in 13.5 overs  for a  confirmed playoff spot.. With thier batting line up it looks possible...,3
Not having that 'T' pattern on the front of his hair has made Archer more aerodynamic and led to an increase his pace.,7
"Jofra looks as the most uninterested dude, and then he bowls",18
Tf is sunny g smoking,8
Only sky has bullied archer.,4
That was a 2 gill,5

Poor move shouldn‚Äôt have brought on the spinners in the pp,5
just joined. wtf was that DRS by Rana?,7
"We're going have a match against RR, aren't we?",7
Must be shit being the other opener with Jof. Every ball you bowl is being targeted because they‚Äôre terrified of the other end,3

Clueless captaincy from smith again as expected,8
"Looks like RR has only one proper bowler, an all rounder and Lord Tewatia.

If Rajasthan get even just 1 decent bowler to go with Archer next season they will be the best team,55
KKR hasn't figured out the batting order yet.,6
"Season after season, RR get hammered for shit bowling, yet they continue obsession with C grade Indian pacers, Varun Aaron, Rajpoot, Unadkat etc etc. 

My bet is on buying Parwinder Awana next season",16

Holy shit 17 runs wtf,6
Fucks sake,3
Eye can't believe this. KKR handling pressure and spin well?!,5
RIP rajasthan,1
Should have waited unil power play was over to bowl spinners,1
"If you want SRH/RCB/DD to qualify KKR win is better , especially if its by a close margin",2
Gopal has had a disastrous season. I wonder why he is not getting as much attention as others who have failed.,3
"Idk why everyone still bigs up McCullum as a coach, KKR have been rubbish this year and not one player looks better than before (other than VC of course)",2
Very cool Gopal and Smith.,3
Rohit has got some acting range,3
Smith undoing all Jofra's great work. KKR will be happy with this start now.,5
We have seen some very mind numbing captaincy in this tournament.,4
Do you think RR and KKR will go all guns blazing knowing even a win will take them to playoffs if SRH lose.,2

"""Pace like fire"", ""this is freedom"". Sunny G is at his best today.",6

Gopal undid archer.,5
"Whatever Archer does, his supporting mates have made a promise to shit upon it.",11
I just noticed that the top 4 has the opening player unchanged(barring injuries) since the start of the tournament,1

"Archer 2-0-3-1

Rest of RR 2-0-29-1",8
Just continue this and jofra will bowl all 4 of his and thats a winwin,3
Archer must be so frustrated that after putting  two tightest overs and still having the score 32 after 4th over.,18
surely our batsmen aren‚Äôt going to bottle this... right?,6
Gopal has a horrid ipl this season. Hardly see him picking up wickets or have a good economy,5
Why give back the momentum to KKR?,4
Just don't send in DK next to build the innings and we will have a decent chance to make a competitive score,13
Someone had a talk with Gill and made him quit thala academy,66

"Guys, if this turns out to be a close match: winner will hope for SRH to lose, loser will end on 7th and CSK will end on 8th. Am I right?",3
Believe it or not this is a relatively better PP for us so far all things considered,9
Turns out using sandpaper was the best decision Steve Smith ever made as captain.,65
Has any RR pace bowler(except archer) not gone for a boundary in an over in powerplay,3
Why are ads annoying?,1
"IF MI management is thinking they know who their bogey team is over the years. 

So a tactical loss next game (against SRH) is what I would do to kick RR out.

It's easier to tackle RCB's bowling which is like a leaky faucet and also take care of an ageing ABD than deal with two players who are in their prime Butler/Stokes and add Samson and Smith to that. These 4 collectively pose more danger than an RCB or SRH batting lineups in playoffs. Add to that Archer who can wreck sides in couple of overs with a freak spell.

I as a normal cricket fan want RR in the playoffs than watching imbalanced sides like RCB or SRH. But if I'm part of MI management my priorities will be to see RR is out.

Before people go on a rant saying MI doesn't need to do that as they are great team, I know that MI is a complete team which is on a different level. So lay off on that. 

This is more of  strategic ploy to eliminate the one team that has the potential to ruin their day.",7

RR bowlers sans Archer bringing KKR batsmen back to form,4
I'm liking the Gills aggressive approach recently. His batting was negatively impacting the team imo when he was going slowly.,2
Man it breaks my heart to see Aaron getting belted. Loved to watch him at his peak.,2
I picked Tripathi in my fantasy team. You are in the presence of a cricket genius guys,3
Tripathi looks like a totally different person with and without helmet,4
Rest of the bowling is bottlenecking Archer.,4
"arron gg to get half century faster than gill

Hopefully Mi throw the game against Srh. I don't trust Rr to fuck up in the play-offs,5

"When jof is bowling

"Alright today in this episode of 'Catching up with the pitch', is the pitch changed or is the bowling shit or is the batting good?",3
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Archer requests to be transferred at the end of season. He deserves to be in a team like Mumbai.,16

Narine is the only player in the whole IPL who doesn‚Äôt feel pressure,70
come on tyagi save us,6
"From Karbon Kamaal Chakka to Unacademy Cracking Six, we came a long way.",8
I don't get why Archer doesn't bowl 3 overs in the powerplay he can always get an extra wicket. The only reason I can see is the other bowlers are too expensive in the death hence 2 overs for Archer in the death.,3
Where are RCB playing tomorrow,1
Fake crowd seems to cheer Gill's singles more than Tripathi's singles.,4
"I wonder how quick Jofra bowls when he runs in full tilt. He must‚Äôve tried it at some point, and I‚Äôm sure he loses shape and accuracy, but I‚Äôd love to know how quick it comes out.",3

Bowling well dam less goo,2
Hopefully tonights game ends up in a landslide for whoever wins. Idw the case where both meme teams to qualify for playoffs tmr. At least one of them deserve to fk right off,3
Who do you think will win today,1
Good one Tyagi,3
Tyagi bowling a bouncer? Never thought I‚Äôd see the light of day,2
Shower thoughts: Batsmen wear helmet to pace and cap for spinners. Wicket keepers do the opposite,10
Tyagi is talented but needs to develop his cricketing IQ. First step is to maintain some 'Social Distance' with Unadkat and Varun Aaron.,18
How fascinating is it that the currently bottom placed team (KKR) has a chance of qualifying for the playoffs! THIS IPL HAS BEEN CRAZY IN TERMS OF COMPETITION!,9
"Why are these guys showing so much respect to Tyagi? 4 runs in an over with Russell, Morgan, DK in the dugout. Not acceptable!",3
Tight Tyagi,1
Smith is gonna hold back Archer for Morgan & Russell. Gill & Tripathi should make most of that.,2
Tyagi showing Aaron how to bowl nice without being Joffra,2
Archer is what Bolt would be if he were a bowler. And vice versa. Chilled out run up and 150 kmph thunderbolt. It is the run up which makes it harder for the batsman to face him.,6
*Angry LORD noises*,1
Everyone was hyping up RR so much now they jinxed them,4

"Its somewhat infuriating to think that, in a time when a lot of people have lost their jobs and livelihoods, a guy like Prem Jyotish is probably making extra bank.",5
Styris Meldown: Gill Out,1
"He did his job, we bat deep so it‚Äôs fine. Should be fine if either Narine or Morgan comes out right now",9
Fy gill,6
So RCB DC will make it to playoffs despite losing based on how things are going. They were calculated shit teams after all.,7
Narine pls.,3
Please don‚Äôt send DK right now. Morgan/Narine should come out,4
"Send Narine, please!!",5
Good inning by Gill.,8
I mean atleast he scored at 150 SR,5
Send Narine.,4
Send out Cummins you cowards,5
The lord answers with a wicket,3
Hail Tewatia,3
"**8.3** Tewatia to Shubman Gill, OUT, top edge on the slog sweep, and Buttler is under it. You can start walking **73-2**

Shubman Gill c Buttler b Tewatia 36 (24b 6x4 0x6) SR: 150.00",2
KKR will score 180 plus. RR cant chase it again,2
I don't mind this to be honest. Gill did his job,3
Surely Morgan next. DK was so good at the end in the last game.,4
"If things go right, Narine-Tripathi will be deadly",3
"Cometh the hour

Cometh the lord",4
Not bad. Gill did his job,6
Don't anger the lord ffs,4
"Is anybody here think that RR won't win this match now that they are chasing and there's gonna be jew? Win the toss, win the match. Hashtag that.",1
"Yo, our wild card Narine is in!",2
"**Engage all offenses and get this man his bat**


(Morgan to Narine)",7
Can we stop them below 160??,1
Not the worst thing to happen.,4
Varun chalravarthy should open,2
The team that wins qualifies for sure right ?,-7
Narine again hm...,3
What the actual fuck is that new whitehat jr ad?,6
The Lord has entered the fray.,5
Lord Strikes!,4
RR needs a Corey Anderson today,6
is it me or have you guys heard malayalam through stump mic?,5
"Tewatia is so good.


Koi iski RT utaaro.",27
Buttler has to be the most likeable English cricketer,15
"So finally Baz making the team play in his mindset...

Attack, attack, attack, no respite...",8
Narine that's a brilliant decision,5
"That's good game intelligence by Gill tbh. Realised that they have to keep going hard, and they have Morgan, Russell and Karthik still to come. Can't be afraid to go down swinging in any point of the innings during a T20. There isn't enough time to ""consolidate"" a good partnership on flat pitches especially when you see RR's hitting ability.",24
It‚Äôs either a 12(3) or 74(25) from Narine,11
"I will convert to Tewatiaism, if he manages to take Russell and Morgan out cheaply",10
I don't mind Narine coming out,4
How much runs do RR need to lose by to finish below CSK?,3
Narine is here,3
Anyone come back from F1?,3
Love how David Miller ends up on the field out of nowhere,5
"TMs just tweeted ‚Äúsecond ball wicket for Jofra Archer, yet KKR make 55/1 from the power play.‚Äù I can‚Äôt think of a better summary of RR‚Äôs bowling this season.",6
Chutiya,2
Narine out lmao,2
"Among bowlers who have bowled a minimum of 20 overs, Tewatia has the 9th best economy (7.20). Archer has the 5th best (6.50).",4
dont mess with lord,6
Who jinxed Narine you morons,6
Oh well,2
Madarchod Narine :),2
FUCK IM GONNA SCREAAAAAAM,3
Lord tewatia strikes again and screams his lungs out,6
Obviously Narine had to go berserk against us only ffs,18
Well well,3
Narine doesn't put a price on his wicket,10
"Who wants to join me, I'm starting a lord tewatia cult",10
Commentators- ‚ÄúSunil Narine experiment fails again‚Äù,10
Narine literally does not waste a single ball!,10

Tewatia has been such a game changer this season man,9
Fuck yes,2
KKR are beating themselves here lmao,3
Morgan needs to come now,2
"**8.6** Tewatia to Narine, OUT,  **74-3**

SP Narine c Stokes b Tewatia 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
LORD TEWATIA WTF HAHAAHAH,6
Shreyas Gopal has been an abomination this season. RR seriously have been hurt by his impotency in the middle. They really need to bring Markande in for him in case they qualify.,5
I ADORE BEN STOKES,7
Wow. This is a lost match. We expect more than a duck from Narine now.,3
Ben Stoke KKR! What was that?,6
Tewatia two wickets in an over holy fuck,3
"tbh, sending in Narine isn‚Äôt a bad move at all now. Low risk, high reward since he doesn‚Äôt eat too many balls. Has intent from turn 1",2
It's not an experiment when you do it 90% of the time,6
So like we can't chase this in 13 overs can we,5
"Morgan should've come in, unnecessary pressure now",3
Will Morgan come out?,3
It's Tiwatia Day!!!,3
Fuck Delhi. I'm a RR supporter now.,9
Fuck me,3
HAIL LORD TEWATIA!!,2
KKR falling apart,1
"I am happy that Narine experiment worked the first team . But KKR should really send Morgan in at No 4z

Teams would now plan for Narine . So you have lost the surprise element already .",2
Rohit Tewatia you fucking beauty!!,0
"I mean, he didn't waste balls tho",5
Send in Cummo or Murugan pls pls pls pls wanna see them play well in the last game,1
"This is just brain dead. Sure Narine is hitting right now, but Morgan needs to come in now!!!!

Edit: Oops, guess Narine decided to go 1st ball lulz",1
Watching KKR bat kills me a little from inside,7
"He didn't waste any balls, just pretend he never batted",8
Lord as blessed us!,0
Narine failed again. He only had one good innings which he played against us already. This tailender will not make any runs,1
"I'm now placed in the difficult situation of wanting Eoin Morgan to fail

I feel dirty",10
"Morgan please come bat yourself. Don‚Äôt send Dinesh Kartik to build an innings

Edit: Thank god!",6
Lord performing with bowl too,4
just realised that Tewatia is just Narine who hasn't opened yet.,13
Knights COLLAPSE,5
THE MOTHERFUCKEN LOOORRDDD,4
"Eh, so they can let Miller field in the first innings? I can understand it in the second innings if someone is tired but this is just abusing the rule",13
I wouldn't call this experiment a failure. It cost them 2 deliveries so hardly an issue.,28
"Cometh the hour, cometh the lord x2",6
That's not fair. Narine was playing **six or out**,10
Now morgan then russ and then dk pls,7
Sangakkara is such a brilliant commentator,10
Lord Tewatia is the true game changer,6
Rahul makes things happen Tewatia,4
"I thought today was Narine's day, shit",7
LORD knows he is LORD,2
Atleast Narine didnt waste any balls,2
"Russel next imo, dk outside of the end overs will just be a waste of deliveries",0
"""I want to meet the RR player who hard carried RR this year""  

RR send out Sanju Samson  

""I mean truly hard carried RR this year!""  

RR send out Joffra Archer  

""I MEAN TRULY HARD CARRIED RR THIS YEAR!""  

RR send out Lord Tewatia",4
KKR is stupid with their batting order decisions,4
[removed],3
"Good thing with narine is he doesn't waste balls. If he comes off he changes games and if he doesn't, he is not their Frontline batsman anyway so not a big loss",6
"I don‚Äôt understand why Morgan wouldn‚Äôt come in at 4.

11 overs of Morgan is better than 5 overs of Narine( if he comes off)then 6 overs of Morgan and so on.

Just bat and stop fucking around with the order for fucks sake Eoin.",2
"Wonder what Narine's instructions were
..?",1
Maybe RCB could use Miller in the middle order?,6
Maybe tonight russel will finally hit out for a 80(30),4
Sri sri 1008 lord tewatia,1
Morgan's batting stance looks like he's gonna play some baseball.,2
Haha Bmac spends all the time making notes and then takes this kind of decisions. If it comes off once in a while doesn't mean it is a tactic lol.,2
"Lord has dismissed Narine from his presence. Bring me Morgan, he says.",3
Lord tewatia should have done a srk pose just to rub it in,3
Aww Stokesy‚Äôs in a good mood,2
any possiblity cummo going unsold.might be competition for starc if he decides to play,2
"Ahh, I see KKR have learned to wait until the power play is over before C O L L A P S E",7
I will take my rishta to Tewatia myself if he pulls rekt KKR today,1

Tewatia has been the swap of the season other than Boult,1
tewatia is becoming krunal pandya for rr,5
RR's bowling is lowkey good. The only issue is with the second seamer(Unadkat/Rajpoot/Aaron),2
"*Narine walking past*

KKR Dugout: I pretend not to see it",9

You all can thank us for KKR sending in Narine perennially because that fucker Iyer won‚Äôt bowl Rabada before the death overs even if the match  is gone by then.,6
"shit ball, no need of that kind of deliveries",1
"KKR logically sends Morgan at the right time


**Shocked Pikachu Face**",18
Morgan specialises in top edged sixes.,3
That would have been caught at MCG.,3
We will see fireworks in the chase for sure.,4
I love being an incel ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòå,-11
This is the best thing about Narine. He'll do the hitting or get out soon. No wasting balls,9
Captain Morgan looks **ON** today.,4
This is the best thing about Narine. He'll do the hitting or get out soon. No wasting balls,8
Lmao buttler doesn't want to run at all.,3
"Problem with Narine getting out early after being promoted is not that he wastes balls but that it allows the opposition to come back in a big way by getting 2 quick wickets, and the scorecard reads worse.",5
KKR can get to 190 if they play sensibly,3
Always nice to see the lappebaaz get out early,3
KKR should trade Kuldeep to RR,2
"When I put normal commentary: RR doing well
When I put dugout: KKR doing well
So what should I watch on?",9
"If you think about it, tewatia would be the first Indian player that rr would retain",7
Assists for Tyagi. His first over only went for four. That brings wickets at the other end so often.,5
If Smith is such a great player why doesn't he bowl himself? Checkmate atheists,4
"From the urgency demonstrated by the batsmen, is NRR a thing in this game?",3
"6 years ago, if someone had told us that Miller wouldn‚Äôt be in the playing XI, and Maxwell would constantly fail, no one would‚Äôve believed it",8

Looks like Pune's astrologer has told Morgan he shouldn't come in at no.4,9
"Morgan scores a SIX

So who gets the Altroz? Man of the match?,6
"Don't know what's wrong with KKR they shouldn't be at this position at all they have a really great 11 & great backups also it's only an application problem. Don't know what can they even get in auction which will improve their team maybe Starc for Cummins exchange but they already had Ferguson.
What do you think what do they need in Auction?",2
They are already wiping the balls. This is shit.,1
Did you guys know that the Altroz is the Gold Standard of hatchbacks?,16
Not much dew tonight. Hard luck RR,1
"So many nasty comments on the narine decision so let me tell you what was probably going on in the KKR managements' head. Narine comes in - he is strong against spin and medium pace and weaker against extreme pace - RR bring extreme pace on - extreme pace used up before the death - Russell, Morgan and DK make merry in the death

Its not a bad line of thought, didn't work but with narine it's not too much of a risk - 11 overs left when he got out (66 balls) with Morgan, DK and Russell to come with tripathi still ther so even if he gets out its not delibitating - it's not like he pulled out a 10(15) innings",15
Cricinfo says dew on the field already.. Tough for KKR,7
"Kkr losing steam, need dre russ to fire tonight",3
This is one hell of a match where both teams want a big win. A small win might mean curtains for both teams.,2

"People should stop talking about Narine's batting role! If it works it's good, if not it's a miss. He's not someone around whom a batting order works. He's a floater and his role is to accumulate quick runs. People be making big fuss about his role with the bat.",7
Varun arron useless,1

* CSK beat KKR and KXIP

* KKR lose to KXIP(at that point NRR was not really in RR's favour)

* SRH to lose to one of their last 3 vs table toppers.

"LOL DK.

But yes the Lord, lovely stuff, this.",5
Guys how many times has DK gotten out on a duck or scored less than 5?,3
Tewatia take two come on pretty pleeeeaseeeee,4
Russel at 4 anyways,3
DK is gonna go to the bathroom and cry for a few minutes :(,2
Lord weaves a web around KKR,3
Ofcourse KKR had to play nicely against us only and fuck up our chances.,3
Man would be great if RR chase it down in 13 overs,5
Hahaha Duckesh Karthik,5
[deleted],-1
Lord has played around enough,1
The Lord is merciful and vengeful when he wants. Cower before his might puny KKR mortals.,2
Perfect set up for Russell,0
Lord vs Lord....,2
Andre Russell is scary tho. He might take them to 180+,3
Russel  play out LORD pls,1
"Everybody to DK: lopala, chaala lopala, koncham kuda kadu",1
DK HAAIYAA!,1
Karthik is literally the reverse Uthappa. The latter can only bat as an opener while Karthik can only bat at the death,6
Commentators crack the same jokes everyday when Russell comes out with those weird shoes!,2
kareena literally wearing a skin suit and saying breathe easy,6
So RR gonna do MI 2014 ? Not sure about the year,3
At this rate DK will replace Dhoni at CSK next season,8
"Guess that's curtains for KKR, don't think dre Rus has it in him to bat 7 overs",6
DK before the death overs is playing worse than Nagarkoti,3
Which part of send karthik in the last 5 and he wont fail you does kkr not get?,12
Yeah baby thats what I've been waiting for,1
For real. Why is Russel wearing two different shoes?,5
"If there was ever a table for unwarranted sympathy points, DK would win it for perpetuity. Why is someone his long term fan beats me",3
Stokes is going to throw DC/RCB out of IPL this year.,7
"36 - 0 - 39 - 0 - 20 - 0 

The numbers Mason.....

What does it mean?",7
"Even if Russell goes ape shit and somehow take KKR to 190 , Buttler, Stokes will easily undo that effort with jew to help them.",1
"Honestly. Seriously. How the fuck did Tewatia flew under the radar all this while. After the Kings knock they said he's a ""One hit wonder"". Man is proving to be a gem.",34
bhaag bhaag DK Bose DK Bose DK Bose DK...,7
"DK is always a disappointment. 

Throughout his career whether for Tamil Nadu or in IPL",6
Bruh at this rate RR will chase this in 10 overs. Please no...,5
"Lord, Have mercy of those mortals!! They have suffered enough!!!",8
KKR getting folded by Tewatia get off the face of ours losers,3
KK ~~R~~ Haar,4
csk looking to buy dk next season,4
"If kkr win this, bring banton and lockie in for either De Rus and Narine.",1
How NUFC takes a dump in Ancelloti's coffee,2
You can see the dew factor setting in. Fielders are slipping left and right!,5
"Despite the competition, KKR has to be the worst managed side of this lot.

Even CSK have made the right choices a few games. KKR have somehow managed to fuck their order up every single game.",11
Tyagi on a water slide,8
"I would say Russell clearly gets dressed in the dark, but I think those shoes are so bright it wouldn't matter",5
"Dew, what dew? -- *Lord Tewatia*",11
KKR ke ban gaye kurkure,2
"Wtf happened.

I saw before sometime it was 1 and now 5 down.",0
What a spell by tewatia,3
Thank you LORD,7
Morgan: nOnOoOnOoNonO,5
A 5fer from Cummo and some Narine magic is the only hope for KKR today,5
Things change quickly,1
"KKR has some quality leg spinners, and what's DK doing in nets. Must be improving his keeping skills. Cringe.",6
He played a cover drive and edged it to short mid wicket ??????,6
If Varun gets a chance for Australia then Tewatia surely deserves too,2
I don‚Äôt think Morgan gives any fucks about this IPL anymore since he has the WORLD CUP under his belt,4
"Russell in at the perfect time. Not bad from Morgan, team isn't performing thats all",2
And that's the end of DK at KKR. I think either us or RCB will be bringing him next year.,6
"Rahul ""Shane Warne"" Tewatia",8
"RCB and DC to KKR: bc, itna jaldi kyun?",7
Who did DC trade Tewatia for?,9
Mumbai gonna do a 40d move and let srh win against them so they don‚Äôt have to face Rajasthan,5
Russell sabka badla lega,2
DK would be perfect for SRH if KKR want to release him.,12
The matches are too one-sided now because the pitches are playing much better the second innings. It is making the results predictable and boring. Whoever wins the toss will win the match.,6
What happens if KKR get all out inside 20 overs  for 140 or so? And  RR chase it down in around  14 overs?,5
Morgan showing the respect and is just happy to keep Tewatia's last ball out,6
"I want a Russell and Morgan special, Please.",2
"Can we just call DK, BSDK from now on.",8
Par score anyone?,3
Lord casually letting people not forget hin,5
"If rr wins this, will there be some negative effect on srh?",1
Now repeat after me: DK is an excellent player of Spin,6
[deleted],10
"Lord Aaron and tyagi will undo all of tewatias hard work


You heard it hear first",7
Why does RR have to chase it within 13 overs? To beat whose NRR?,8
All hail Lord Tewatia,3
Weather report from Dubai. It's slightly less humid compared to yesterday but expect some dew.,7
Chakravarathy's spell is gonna be very important tonight,4
How many ducks for Rana and DK each this season,0
DK for RCB please,2
Lord during the post-match presentation: Why fear when I am here?,3
Lord showing his bowling skills today as if someone called him a bits and pieces player,5
Dinesh Karthik once again showing anxiety induced by Vijay. Returns back to the dugout before any of his teammates can chat his wife up.,4
Don't have to decide where to bowl Lockie if he doesn't play at all - Morgan prolly,4
"The two faces of Karthik

Before 16th over - The loser that Vijay cucked.

After 16th over - The star who snagged that badminton hottie.",11
KKR eventually found their true position at the points table :/,5
[removed],-18
Ajio ads are the worst,2
"100/5 7 overs left, a carribean bomb and an english/irish time bomb on the crease if perfect kkr, lets see how the fuck it up",1
DK and Rana have just become Platinum members of the 3 ducks per match club,2
"Tewatia has been incredible. Bowls either tidily, effectively or both, not neither. He also finishes well with the bat and is a solid fielder. I think that the calls for him getting called up for India are premature, but he‚Äôs a solid player for sure.",6
Entire batting lineup can shit the bed and yet one dude will be the scapegoat.,1
"If Varun can get in with one spell, why can't Tewatia?",2
Not gonna miss Karthik for sure if he is dropped whenever the next auction is held.,3
Theory: Dinesh Karthik is performing horrendously so that he won't be bought in the next auction by anyone and therefore be able to play Bangladesh premier league,13
"Said it before, time for Rinku Singh to step up for KKR captaincy",5
Hmmm do RR have the budget left to buy Starc? Just want to see Archer and Starc bowling in tandem. But that does mean they have to drop Smith so I am not too confident....,7
Rajasthan have to attack from the start right? They can't be thinking about using most of the 20 overs to chase the target down.,2
safe to say - we have more south indians playing in ipl right?,0
"MG Hector- compliments me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a human thing‚Äù.

Thirsty me when I see that exhaust pipe- üò´üò´üçÜüçÜüí¶üí¶üöóüöó",3
"Bowl archer please

Bowl archer please
 He can bowl short and dre russ and morgan suck against short ball.",0
Russel. 7 overs of dew. Must win. Let's go,1
I want to see Russel show today please Russel,1
hogg rider russell from coc in to bat.,5
Reminder that KKR will finish last if they lose this,2
Memes aside Lord's been impressive throughout the tournament!,6
Why tf was even Kartik selected for last year's WC.,2
"All the matches I've watched, Russell has never batted well",1
Lord tewatia back to his rightful top 3 spot in mvp,2
Anyone know the runs KKR needs to win by/number of overs RR needs to chase for RCB to qualify?,2
specialist batsman Cummins will save the day,4
Get Jof on now. Getting Dre Russ and Morgan ends this game.,2
"Surprisingly, Russell actually hasnt done anything with the bat this season.",4
So end of career for DK?,2
"So teams will go to fielding first now?

And will dew decide the result of the match from now on?",1
"DK will still make bank next auction if KKR releases him. 
This is because every other team has a shit lower middle order and someone like DK, despite his rough patch, will get bids from teams like RCB, SRH or maybe even CSK.",3
Time to get Varun or Jofra against Dre Rus,2
I‚Äôm pretty sure there are a few unsold domestic Indian batsmen who will perform as well as Smith has in this IPL if given an extended run in the top 3.,3
"Questions for you guys - 

1) Who'd MI want to face in Qualifier1? RCB or DC?

2) Assuming SRH wins last match & is the 3rd team to qualify & RR win this, who'd you like to see as the 4th team? RR or loser of RCB/DC?",2
Rajasthan's leg spin choke and 4 KKR middle wickets show that KKR missed a trick by not including Kuldeep. Kuldeep singlehandedly  won them the 2018 eliminator against the same opposition as far as I can remember. He would've been a handful against the likes of Stokes and Buttler. He could've been in the team in place of Mavi or Nagarkoti.,2
Russell dada pls play today we wanna see you,2
Such a nonchalant boundary.,2
"Russell is done imo, time for the glue factory",3
"Why tf is Russell dancing down the pitch? Dude, you can clear the ground with one hand.",2
"How did that go for 4, wtf.",3
"If RR wins & SRH loses, and RCB loses, can RCB still go through with NRR?",3
why the fuck is russell wearing different colour shoes? and please dont call it fashion now ffs,6
"I think KKR has a reasonable chance of getting to 170+ provided Russel sticks around.

With the dew settling in, Russel and Morgan are going to back themselves to play the big shots.",2
"Russell man, he is still there, he is a beast nothing can be sure till he is on field

 I hope Dubai ground is big enough such that ball doesn't go for six by just touching his bat's edge slightly

I hope Buttler's finger is fine...",6
Four runs but all the way along the ground. Dew will do the rest,3
That 4 was effortless,4
Really good chance for Dre to redeem himself,9
I would never understand that Rahul Tewatia is a good cricketer OR just a lucky guy!?!?!,9
Gopal has been average this season,10
How did gopal become so shit so quick?,4
Did Morgan play with Captain Morgan bat even when DK was captain?,5
"Fuckers can't send dk where he's supposed to bat....last four overs

But then kkr collapse so often that sometimes they don't have a choice",9
Morgan ¬Ø\_‡≤†_‡≤†_/¬Ø,5
Gopal wtf :(,5
this is the morgan i signed up to watch,5
Captain Morgan!,6
These 2 have nothing to lose now. Some manic hitting incoming,5
Um... well then what now,5
Gopal always coming to the rescue of KKR,5
I guess Morgan saw Rashid khan in shreyas gopal,6
Mumbai gonna do a 40d move and let srh win against them so they don‚Äôt have to face Rajasthan,10
Bring Archerr,9
Morgan has lion's heart to still go on hitting,10
Smith is an idiot. Ffs bowl archer u coward,7
Gopal's soul was taken by Lord Tewatia,3
Morgan has no use for a wooden spoon it seems.,7
Gopal get fucked lol,7
Morgan gonna show why he won the world cup,12
Gopal getting junked around tbh,5
Morgan is actually incredible once he‚Äôs got going,8
Shift in momentum...,6
Morgan going off,7
"Can you not bowl this jackass again RR, thx",5
Fxing gopal,2
21 of this over wtf,10
Morgan showing KL Rahul how to play without giving any fucks,14
Morgan has killed Gopal.,6
Who the fuck showed Morgan his strike rate against spin?,11
"Morgan as a captain might be a question mark for KKR, but Morgan is the best counter attacking player in this IPL. Iyer, Kohli some who could learn how to recover from a bad spot",10
Gopal undoing Lord's work.,12
Fuck yes Morgan!!!!!,6
fucking gopal ffs ruined everything,15
Morgan playing the captain's knock...,6
If Russell gets in 200 is possible. Funny how gopal has changed the tone of innings for a second time today,4
gopal LMAO,2
RR are fucked,3
Tewatia has gone for just 97 off the last 15 overs he's bowled. Has an economy of 7.11 this season (45.4 overs).,8
Lara questioned this guy's selection before the start of the match .,8
Why was this intent missing before Morgan?,4
Morgan showing why he's the English Captain,6
"well gopal already gave 17 off his first over, why would you give him another?",6
RINSED,3
"I can already see Karthik going down the Uthappa route in the next few years. 

He'll get 10 crores in the auction, play 2 good innings in the entire season, and will refuse to retire.",7
"Lol, switched to reddit for a bit and a mini carnage out there",2
"get fucked, AB's specialist wicket taker",4
Sober Irishman pounds small brown boy and his toy watch,3
"Man, just not Gopal's day. Wonder if Smith will try to get an over out of Parag",3
"Even though Morgan is going for it, I think we should play safely and get to 160-170. A wicket here and 150 will be tough with Jofra's overs left. Forget the NRR and get the 2 points. There is a definite chance that MI will eventually win.",3
Morgan showing England lite who is MVP lmao,5
Rashid Khan knows. Knows very well,3
"*DK comes in before the 15th over*.

DK: aight I'mma head out",9
Who was the rajashthan fan begging for gopal to be bowled?,5
Morgan doing a Russell,5
This has to be the ballsiest innings I've seen this IPL. No stopping this madlad captain!,7
All the work undone in just 1 over.,2
What has gotten into Cap Morgan??? This isn't the Thala Morgan we were promised. Anyways he looked in touch since a couple games. Hopefully will make this match interesting.,5
"Every team has one bowler that leaks runs, RR has 4 of them.",14
Gopal single handedly throwing the game,3
Pls sack smith next auction,2
My goodness that Rummy circle ad makes my ears bleed,2
"rr Has markande
Gopal has been bad in general

Still RR will suck on his ineffective googlies",2
That over helps KKR see out Archer's 12 deliveries.,2
"Need a wicket this over, good decision to bring back Archer.",3
[deleted],-1
"For RR to qualify, SRH should loose right. For sure they can't improve their abysmal run rate.",2
O Pal,1
Gopal is kill,1
Inb4 KKR buy Gopal next auction,2
See off this over ffs,3
Tewatia sets field for himself. Smudge sets field for gopal. Thats says so much.,4
"This is how you treat a uncapped leggie. GG Morgan.  If you are gonna give respect to every tom dick harry, then when are you gonna score?",7
Baz standing inside the field ‡≤†_‡≤†,4
"Wicket alert!

Archer Vs Morgan",7
Why go with Gopal there? You don‚Äôt need to. Some of Smith‚Äôs captaincy has been odd this tournament. Like Jofra not bowling the 19th vs RCB.,6
They should get markhande for the playoffs if they qualify.,2
McCulMorgan,3
Now watch russell hit archer for a six just to get out nxt ball (kg Rabada flashbacks),5
thank you morgan. rr prolly wont chase this down in 13overs now. sigh of relief as rcb fan.,5
That last over basically forced RR to bring Archer,5
"if archer does not get a wicet now, good score might be on board",3
Archer PLEASE GOD please *please*,3
*NOOOOOUUUOOOOO*,1
Russell looks very rusty.,3
Chad Archer vs Virgin Russel,4
of course russell s going to drop anchor.,2
That shoelace tie is for the sponsor,1
"Wow, looks like all Indian LOI players are struggling with leg spin these days.",1
hot take time - In all of world cricket Morgan is only behind Kohli at being able to switch between accumulator / hitter role at will,13
DK : i must maintain the pattern or I die,7
"Baz's philosophy is really simple. ""Swing harder, I guess."" LOL. :D",9
Well played.,4
Baz standing almost next to Stokesy on the field.,2
It‚Äôs somehow so great to know that Baz who scored 158 in the first game in the IPL for KKR is their head coach now.,8
Russell just has to survive this over now,8
That might just break the shackles for DreRuss,5
"Eoin Morgan be like, Fuck Y'all. Imma do this alone.",6
Morgan maar raha hai,5
"If KKR doesn't play off Archer, poor cricket from them. There's literally no one apart from Archer who they can't go after!",6
Maybe McCullum has confused his team by saying they have to be bold. It sounds a lot like bowled.,7
B R A V E,5
Russell in Bois,6
Dre is charging up ‡≤†‚Äø‡≤†,3
Cya next year RR. Dre Russ in form,2
"""We're gonna have to do it against their big bowlers""

Where are these other big bowlers then?",5
KKR winning this ...,5
"Ok Russell hit a six to archer, time to go",3
"Didn't get that at all lol, still 6.",3
Russell is back in form. Fk,2
"Russell going so hard, might get out soon.",4
Allah meherbaan toh gaddha pehelwaan,1
Only one bowler is allowed for RR to perform. Lord used that quota tonight,6
That phase where KKR might get 200 or even end up 160.,6
Russel dada showing signs of return and he's not 100% fit,5
The Russell I know,2
"Everyone: Russell, survive this over

Russell: Y E E T",9
Archer clean him up,3
Gg KKR,1
Buckle up lads,3
Six and out now?,2
Russell 60(20) incoming,4
"Common sense would dictate seeing this over out.

Dre - Fuck that.",10
Is peak Russel back?,6
Russell single handedly cancelling Archer,9
This is shaping up to be a depressing Sunday. Both KXIP and RR not doing well.,5
Inb4 varun Aaron 40 run over,6
Should've dropped karthik ffs,3
Morgan ki gun dhaye dhaye,3
"The NRR calculations are meaningless because RCB DC don‚Äôt lose games, they get annihilated. Just win your match and you‚Äôll be fine.",10
"Archer getting hit for a six, wicket incoming?",4
KKR should have rested Russell when he was injured and played him in remaining matches.,6
"Russel be like, my turn now.",3
KKR: Taking 2s is for the weak.,7
"6 and 1, sunny is happy",7
"If these two stay till the end, the total will be 200.",2
We're fucked.,2
KKR 196-6 final score,13
Get him out fast or game over RR,3
That should've have been 2,3
"I am not watching this match, and the bot is pretty slow and reading u guys'comments scares me",3
Question to McCullum: pariksha ki padhai kaisi chal rahi hai?,5
Everyone jinxed RR man. Everyone.,17
"*my stream is late*

Morgan bruh....

They are scoring 200",10
Suddenly Morgan and Russell look like Hulk and Thor. Smash any and every thing üòÇ,33
Eoin morgan knows all of Archer's plans. He's not taking any risks,8
Based Baz still on the field without a care in the world.,2
Russell is back in the house bois,3
Both DC and RCB are definitely making it to the playoffs now,6
Russel this is not RCB.,10
This is gonna be an epic game üèèüèè,3
End of road for DK?,6
smh.. okay we‚Äôve lost this one then gg guys,3
Daddy Russel's arm is wider than 2 Chahals combined,8
It's an all England affair,6
At least KKR are trying to post a massive total.,7
"11 runs off Jofra, more than enough off him",6
Credit to KKR for not letting their run rate drop even though wickets are regularly falling.,1
"Post match host: so how was it like with the middle order not firing again?

Morgan post-match: I am the middle order",5
Tfw RCB were 129/5 after 15 overs couple of matches back and ended up with only 160 odd üòí,6
One Jofra over left in the last five. 200 on the caards.,5
"Can we get 70 in the last 5, just like the good old days",5
Remember when Baz fucked India in Nz once?,3
"regardless of who wins today, England will definitely win today",8
Time to go back to keeping my hopes down.,7
"No way I can imagine RR chasing the target in 15, let alone 13. If they do, then give them the cup already.",8
Dont bowl aaron. Anybody but aaron,3
"T20 world cup is coming boys, Kohli will be back to his former self soon.",3
So who bowls 4 of the last 5 overs?,5
Dre Russsss,1
5 overs left. 1 over from Archer. This could get ugly for Rajasthan.,5
"""Score at least 180 or die trying"", Baz said. I like my coach.",10
Just bowl 6 yorkers madudes,3
Welp KKR is getting 200+,4
Wtf is Russell made of to be injured all the time?,3
Oh yes! Finally. And thank fuck it ain't against rcb.,7
"Smith, no why would you bring Tyagi nooo",5
**He's back baby**,3
*chuckles* We are in danger,4
Haha Russell coming back into form in the last game,4
It's muscle time,3
"If its get to 200, send Buttler up to open with Stokes and score 80 in the first 6 overs.",3
4D chess from RR bowlers to set the total perfectly been 180-200,5
You guys better UnJinx RR.,8
Muscle Russell is B A C K,3
"KKR playing sensibly right now. As long as these two hold on to their wicket, they have every chance of winning

Edit: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",3
Lmao DreRuss firing... Ciao RR,5
"kkr when their top order is dismissed.

ohno   anyway",5
Dre Russ pullin up on perfect time for KKR,4
"Cut Russell some slack, he isn't 100 percent fit. He can't run quick 2s",4
wHy dID tHeY bENcH fErGuSOn,5
Where was all this aggressiveness this season? FFS,5
Give the ball to stokes ffs,5
Fucking smoked that.,4
We're so fucked.,3
"Yeah, Russel looks dangerous. RR is getting their ass whooped.",3
Russel has awaken,2
why the fuck is tyagi giving it in the slot wtf? that looks like the most basic bowl ever. man fuck off tyagi,3
This is the day when Andre the giant rises from the ashes,2
I am scared,3
"Okay wow he was back, RR take it close yea?                                     Edit- was*",4
Game over for RR.,3
First 4 batsman are basically just ‚Äúhow many can we get before the game actually starts‚Äù,5
"Tyagi is like ""Fuck! Why me""",5
Russell finally showing up with the bat,2
Get in,1
Rr cowering in fear,1
Oh no,1
We are fucked now,2
Sad csk noises,1
"Offense is the best form of defense, see off the 1 over Archer has left and go hulk smash in other 4, 185 is still on for KKR. 



And as I type this, in total agreement with what I commented, Russell hits 2 sixes lmao. Harsha Bhogle who?






Edit- Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck",4
RUSSEL Muscle üí™üèªüí™üèª,3
Every team needs an Andre Russell,2
"Will be ""learning experience"" for Tyagi either way. Siraj had such an experience last year and came back as a better bowler.",2
We're fucked boys,1
"Russell peaking too late

But still I'll enjoy this",3
As a pak fan I was genuinely hoping my predictions about the worst happening were wrong but oh well this is RR,2
220 possible here?,1
"Andre ""Muscle"" Russell is back",3
Cmon man so is this KKR redemption arc?,3
"Tyagi set the field for that shot, but Russel doesn't care lmao",3
It warms my fucking heart win or no win this is why I still love this team,4
"oh no

anyway",7
Russel mania & Morgan blitz in progress. One for the ages,3
Oh no Russell firing is bad for other teams as well,2
Dre has picked the right game to turn up,3
Can we have Archer bowl all the remaining overs pls?,3
My projection : 24 runs this over,1
Get these 2 out :(,3
"Only one over of archer left. 

KKR eyeing 220 here.",2
Dre Russ showing Intent*,2
Except RCB all teams peaking at right time lol,5
Imagine if RR don't try to chase the total and just play to screw KKR NRR,2
Dre russ has officially arrived,2
Thala Stokes.,7
Lmao get fucked Russell in your face hahaha,3
Tyagi you beauty,5
HOLY FUCK THANK YOU BEN STOKES WHAT THE FUCK,25
LETS GOOOOO TYAGI SHOWS HIS CLASS,4
"If I was RR, then I'd finish Archer and expect he gets one of these two.",3
LET'S FUCKING GOOO,2
Oh what a relief,2
Damn great wicket for RR,2
Imagine if Russ had the sensibility to knock it around after two sixes.,5
What did stokes whisper to Tyagi lmao,2
RUSSELL SPRAYED SOME SEXTILLION 7TH POWER,5
"Today is the lord's day. Any score they put up, the lord is gonna get it",5
For fucks sakes man,3
There goes brain-dead Russell.,2
That's the match Bois.,5
Bloody hell...,2
Russell is dumb,7

"Lol who yelled that ""Noooo""",8
Scary territory now. Need a wicket.,4
Yesssssss. Halllaaaa bol !!!!!!!,3

Why Tyagi why :),2
Thala stokes tips,7

That went from 100 to 0 real quick,5
10 balls curse still got DreRus,2
U DID YOUR JOB BIG MAN,5
Brainless batting. 2 sixes and then also going when you know that you are the last batsman.,6
Yo leave our U19s alone Russell,11
What a shot by the cameraman.,3
Stokes talked to him before that ball üëÄ,6
"Man, how much i wish i was at home watching the live action, fuck everytime russel hits i am not the live game, and i am diehard fan of him",5
Fuck,2
Morgan need to take them to 180,3
"*my stream is late*

FK man, 5 overs left and only 1 of those Jofra's...shit.",4
"omg wtf RR do something, let KKR be the wooden spoon.",2
Fuck,3
HAHA RUSSELL,3
"In one way, im hoping the score will be high since They chase big scores in ease",3
There was zero need for that. He had already gotten 12 runs off the over.,3
"Russel: Right in the slot.

Her: Right in the slot.

Gambling machine: Coin in the slot.

Diary: I might have a slot.

Letterbox: In the slot.",4
Russell is Bac ^(aand gone),7
Tyagi you beautiful,3
Oh Man. Just when this was getting exciting where 200+ was a possibility Russel goes.,1
200 cancelled,6
Dre Rus/Morgs or Tewatia/Stokes. Don't know who I'd rather in the play offs.,4
"Russell can walk up straight to those ladies now I guess. I don't see an issue for him, just KKR",3
Being an RCB at this moment seems sweet ngl üò≥,9
[deleted],2
"Russell cunts Tyagi all over the ground.

Stokes talks to Tyagi briefly.

Next ball Tyagi gets him out.",5
"Before: DRERUSS IS HERE

Now: Dumb Russell",3
Thank god for that üòÇ,3
Everyone blaming Smith for bowling choices like he even has a choice to begin with :/,15
They had 5 sixes in the last 10 balls.. going for every single ball in 16th over was a bit too much,8
"Russell fits in the phrase

All brawn no brains",13
Stokes for RR captain 2021.`-`),11
"Only 10-12 balls more of this onslaught and KKR couldve taken away the game, RR have the upper hand now.",9
This is peak r/cricket Jinxing.,6
"**15.3** Kartik Tyagi to Russell, OUT, big grunt from Russell as he has found deep cover to perfection. Tyagi misses the wide yorker by a foot or so, which means Russell sees a six over cover, but ends up hitting this straight to the man. He is really upset with himself **144-6**

AD Russell c sub (DA Miller) b Kartik Tyagi 25 (11b 1x4 3x6) SR: 227.27",3
"Dre Russ gets carried away. After two sixes, that wasn‚Äôt needed",2
"Bruh, this match is swinging like a see-saw",11
Is Jos okay? He‚Äôs been off the field a lot. That can‚Äôt be a good sign.,11
How could we forget their best batsman Cummins?,3
[deleted],1
Stokes wondering why that didn't work with Braithwaite,8
Someone should've told Russell this is not Chinnaswamy,3
Yes Tyagi!,2
Who was shouting? Tyagi?,3
[deleted],17
Good comeback by Tyagi. Kept his head cool despite being smacked for 2 sixes.,3
Stokesy at it with golden tips,4
"In Russell's defence that's the only way he play, i wished DK was held back, this was the perfect time to for him to come and make a mark",7
Sir Ben 'Tips' Stokes,8
Scotty jinxed KKR ffs friendship ended with him Sanjay is my best friend,5
"Scott Styris, Ben Stokes, I'm gonna name my children after you.


Context-Scott Styris said that Russell is gonna get out this over, and Stokes had a chat with Tyagi and he picked up Russell's wicket next ball",6
I'd rather CSK finish last than RR qualify,-9
Our designated finisher comes out to bat to see us through to the 20th over.,5
Need to attack the tailenders and bowl them out.,2
Somebody get Russell back on steroids. This is just sad.,3
KKR is still in a good position to have a decent total thanks to Russel & Morgan,3
"I'm Sorry, I Jinxed Russell",8
"Stokes told the bowler to ""Just get him out""",5
It was there to be hit. He just didn't make the correct contact.,3
This matching is looking intense.,1
As usual Russell thinking with his muscles,4
"I think he did his job, 44 odd runs in last 2 overs",5
"I still sometimes go in awe of IPL, SMITH, and ARCHER in one team :D Wow! I remember the ashes!",5
Loving the ebb and flow of this innings. Could be a cracker of a match after three boring games this weekend,12
"*My steam is late*

Russel bruh...leave the kid, Tyagi deserves wicket here, after two back to back sixes",7
KILLAH MILLAH,4
Stokesy really saved our asses there huh.,6
Our main batsman is finally here !!,11
So stokes goes to Tyagi after 2 sixes and never in this season have i seen captain speak to this young lad about bowling...cunt smith,17
At some point someone needs to tell Russell that you can't hit every ball for six. Might work on some days. Maybe once a year. But won't work everyday. Singles of the rest of the balls would have still yielded 16 off the over.,9
captain stokes.,6
"What's interesting is Stokes was chatting with Tyagi before the wicket ball, I wonder what he said",3
"Wait, KKR are playing Cummins instead of Ferguson? Mavi and Nagarkoti over Krishna? How stupid is that?",-1
"Yeh toh shuru hote hi khatam ho gaya!

T: this got over the moment it started!",3
"Dre did his job regardless. His 25 from 11 shifted momentum completely.

Morgan and the Cumdog can easily guide this to a 180.",13
Turns off cheat codes gets out very next ball.,6
"Holy shit that was looking really, really scary for RR there that phase. Russell just dragged this a little more than timing it towards the empty backward point area.",7
Why is Stokes getting the credit lol?,16
Cummins on to make a 23(10).,6
"Russel gone, cometh Cummins, there best finisher this season ?",5
"As long as Morgan is here, 200+ is loading,.. Fite me",6
KKR just needs to get to 200. Pressure on RR will make things happen,5
Kartik Tyagi and Paddikal have been the most exciting debutant youngsters this year,10
ngl good comeback by Tyagi,3
"If Stokes had dropped that, everyone would have chanted          Go Stokes Go",-2
The problem is even if RR win they might not get top 4 now,8
"As a DC, RCB fan. I'm just happy at least one of them will qualify tmr.",4
KKR need a purge in the next mega auction,7
"Stokes must have told him, ""Keep it away from their body. I learnt it the hard way.""",11
Great comeback Tyagi!,2
Great comeback from Tyagi,2
[deleted],4
What a comeback by tyagi,5
Stokes versus Morgan let‚Äôs go,7
I respect morgans counter attacking approach really hope the results don't give excuses for coaches to play the tuk tuk game,9

Maybe it's time for Russel to be a mature T20 player like Gayle. Pick your bowlers and be content with a couple of boundaries an over. Don't get out trying to go for glory.,4
"Guys remember when great Thala gave tips to Tyagi? Yeah, it's showing now.",8
Damn that beauty! Slower one sextillion,2

Looks like Stokes knows Morgan's weakness.,7
I am sorry I still can't accept Stokes with bountiful hair.,6
"Comeback from Tyagi. Good on Stokes, too. Awfully daft on Russell's part, though.",3

"We can look at this match in phases of 10 balls. Like a heavy weight boxing match, the teams are throwing punches & counter punches. Fascinating to watch",5
At least we will get to 150. 180 will be good but looks tough.,2
Brilliant bowling from stokes!,3
Ben really gives his all doesn't he. Every single time.,2

Great over from Stokes,12
Russell Game plan :  POWER>>>>>>>>BRAIN,31
By how many runs can Delhi afford to lose tmrw?,5
"That throw was way off, the backup fielder had to dive for it",5
If the target is under 180 I think RR should go for the 13 over win,23
Russell cant hit towards square. Wide yorker/ slot is good to bowl at him.,9
Just 7. Remarkable over.,2
Is this the first game of the season that Stokes is bowling in? Feels like he hasn't bowled in this IPL,2
Holy shit that would have been an incredible run out,3
Could‚Äôve been way more than 6 so I‚Äôm not mad...,2
of course stoks is the one that knows how to curb thos windies powerhitters in full flow.,7
I wish I had Stokes‚Äô drive.,3
Is buttler injured?,2
They were looking like 210 just 5 minutes ago,4
"Stokes definitely should've bowled more, even his first over wasn't bad. Went for a six which was barely above fielder's height.",3
The dude just gave 6 runs off of a 16th over. He's still disappointed about the boundary.,10

Off topic but Deepak Hooda is just 25 TIL.,9

Stokes is in some ‚Äúnot today‚Äù mood today.,7
Ben stokes joined the team late but as expected made a great impact in short span.,8
"RR fans, would you prefer RR to chase this within 15 overs or would a win suffice for you lot?",3
Why Archer now?,3
"Wtf, this RR team only has Stokes or what? Stokes fielding, stokes bowling, stokes giving Bowler instructions and stokes batting. Very unfair to play this one person against a team of 11 guys.",18

Sadly can't fap to Stokes fielding in NNN,10
Morgan play this 2 balls sensibly,3
Where tf are all the fielders. Lmao!,5
All three matches of this weekend have been let down in terms of entertainment. And I think it's this one's gonna be too.,1
Anybody else but Uthappa there and that may have been a chance,6
Like how KKR is playing fearless cricket,9
WTF is that dew LMAO,7
When it's obvious they will show the most crystal clear angles and zoom the shit in and for close calls they will use the most shittiest cameras they have and the most useless camera angles,9
Is it possible for RR to chase 170 in 14 overs?,1
"I wish we had someone like stokes in India, probably my favourite cricketer in the world.",10
In the mega auction. Which overseas do you think rr will retain?? Archer is obvious. Butler or stokes???,7
Russell is such a waste of potential because he just won't use his brain. Needed a good mentor to mould him.,12
I kinda like RR jersey. There is something attractive about it.,8
"Morgan still hasn't got a 50 this ipl, damn",6
I feel likes there's no way we will win this,3
129 that felt like 149 hot damn,3
RR should try to win the match first before thinking about NRR. You have 0 chance without the 2 points.,3
Swann is definitely  on some coke..,3
Oooooh right on the knee,1
stokes is an absolute unit and true all rounder!!!,3
"Assuming RR wins tonight, I wouldn't be surprised if Mumbai loses against Hyderabad in the last fixture.

Man I just love it when Stokesy‚Äôs in a mood,3
180 ? Looks achievable tbf,1
KKR are playing some badass cricket right now,1
i like rr but rr winning would mean Warner against arche which is certainly not something I'm excited for.,2
Man Archer should be considered a national treasure in England. What a player.,5
"So Archer's quota is over, and next is Stoksy, so final over from Tyagi??",8
Swann does have a mind for marketing. Smort,3

"Yeah there is no way we chasin this in 15 overs, winning it could be done tho",3
"Ben Stokes, That was very many runs Ben Stokes, Ben Stokes",2
Remember how people were going over DK's last knock? It's very evident that he is out of form and not the same DK.,3
"If KKR had played this brand of attacking cricket from the start of the season, I would have felt a little better about the team even if we do not qualify.",5
"If RR somehow qualify for the playoffs, would they consider dropping Smith for a foreign bowler?",0

O Morgan!!! üî•üî•üî•,3
Don't give Stokesy PTSD Morgs.,4

Stokes should be given Lord Status always leaks runs,2
Ben stokes should've kept a few tips for himself instead of revealing all tricks to Tyagi,4
"Everyone: bowl bouncer to morgan
RR bowlers: we dont do that here",3
Fuck me Morgan. His six hitting is so sublime.,2

Kkr has atleast made sure that re doesn't get too much nrr from this match,5
Stokes just relieved at the fact that he doesn't have to bowl to Morgan too many more times after tonight,11
Biggest winners are RCB and DC,4
Why go for a two when Morgan could have taken strike with a single??,9

This retaining strike shit would have been sensible idea in the first ball itself.,9
How is 68* Morgan‚Äôs highest score??,7
Bc who calls a six aadha dozen run. Come on Chopraji,15
RR have to chase it in 13.5 overs to get past NRR of DC and RCB,5
Constant backing leads to improvement in performance of youngsters. Tyagi has the potential to play for India and RR need to back him next season also.,9
NOW THAT IS CONFIDENCE. CAPTAIN MORGAN,4
Something tells me this is below par,3
"Alright we chased 197 against MUMBAI, we can certainly do this too",3
Captain Morgan. You beauty,2
RR need 191 off of 83 (13.81 RPO) to guarantee themselves qualification,10
Morgan is so fucking alpha,11
I really want RR to win this but my god I do love Eoin Morgan.,9
191. KKR can take that anytime,6
Morgan big dick energy there.,7
RR chasing this in 15 overs üíâ,2
Morgan is forgiven,3
Nagarkoti couldn't have done that so better to deny the singles. It would have looked really stupid if Morgan was unable to hit a six off the last ball though Lol.,9
Scenes if RR chase in 13 overs,8
This is a super competitive total by KKR. Time to see if RR can chase a total again?,6
Lol people should have waited until the over was finished before criticising Morgan,13
Damn 3 duck outs,7
Chad Morgan justifying his decision to refuse singles,18
Still well bowled Tyagi.,7
Morgan is very good against full bowls.,6
I can never have the courage that Morgan has. Hat's off!,15
I'd fuck Morgan. He's a cutie.,8
Remember when MI chased 190 in 14.3 overs against RR?,4
RR have to go full MI vs RR 2014 here,2
MI 2014?,2
Fun fact : 10 years ago Morgan was RCB's finisher,1
"[Close enough, but not quite. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jm1aev/Match_Thread%3A_54th_Match_-_Kolkata_Knight_Riders_v_Rajasthan_Royals/gasqx7y/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)",2
How clutch do you have to be to refuse 2 singles to hit a 6 of the last ball,7
"Forget chasing it in 15 overs, It would be a miracle if they even chase this",3
Kartik Tyagi has been cannon fodder for batsmen this season lol.,2
RR please make at least 150,1
Kkr has done enough to get both the teams out of playoffs I guess,5
Dhoni did the same thing against Australia last year. At the end Australia needed 2 runs off 1 ball and won,0
DC and RCB are really happy with the proceedings so far.,3
Get your calculators out guys. What's the NRR if Kolkata wins this by 40 runs?,2
"Feels weird praising bowlers for RR who aren‚Äôt Jof, but well done Tyagi and the Lord. That could‚Äôve easily been well over 200.",4
"Morgan ‚ÄúMSD, I am.‚Äù",7

In how many overs do RR have to chase this?,1
The captain did his job. Credit to Russell too for going aggressively when KKR looked in a spot.,4
I want Cummins to get Stokes in the very first over.,5
Dawid Malan furiously punching the wall after seeing these two balls,2

RR score for wooden spoon?

RR overs to hit -0.2 NRR?",1

"Plot twist:Steve Smith is actually a genius and knew that RR will only be able to chase it down if the target is 170+ , so he gave the forth over to Gopal... 

Ok, I'll see myself out..",9
Aight whip out the calculator boys,7
bruh the guy slapping their ass,1
3 ducks and still a score of 191. Impressive,7
Stokes : *Vietnam flashbacks*,9
RR's gonna chase this before 15th over,3
Surely Buttler must open for RR now? They have to chase this down quickly.,11
Congratulations kkr,6
I hope KKR‚Äôs bowlers are generous with their pies... we need ‚Äòem,5
"Even if we lose this, we put up a good fight",8
"Not that's a captains knock 


KL, koach and Iyer can learn so much from Morgan.",8
"RR should settle for the win.
MI has decent chance to win and they can also hope for one of the RCB or DC to lose badly",9
RR have to hit at around 13.5 po to overtake DC and RCB. Too risky imo,6
MI 2014 anyone? Anderson‚Äôs 90*(30) to be replicated from Buttler,8
Score reads 191 but 3 ducks in them; the real BatDeep,11
"Nagarkoti has made more runs than DK, Rana and Narine, combined",8
"RR should open with Buttler and Stokes and come out swinging, thats the only chance they have.",11
"KKR would be very comfortable with 190 on the board.

I'd still say the scale is tilted in RR's favour. Stokes in sublime form. Butler and Samson can come in with the big hits. Smith and Uthappa ... well you never know.

But then, we have the lord. Tewatia.",5
Now the question will be by what margin kkr has to win to go past NRR of RCB and DC,3
"Quick qualification summary(approx calcs, not 100% accurate)

1. RR chase this in 13.5 overs- guaranteed qualification

2. KKR restrict RR to around 115- guaranteed qualification

3. If neither of these happen, the winner of this match has to hope that either RCB or DC shit the bed massively, OR MI beat SRH",14
RR just don't have the bowling to keep oppositions down. But they do have the batting to take em down.,3
If Stokes fires in the power play again this is definitely chaseable,3
Morgan unleashing his Sextillion^7th^Power.,14
I have a feeling that Stokes gonna do same thing to Patty that he did in headingley,4
" KKR have suddenly got a sniff at winning \*big\*. RR are going to keep going for this high total - if they collapse to 120 then KKR's NRR would go to about -0.15.

"From 99-5 to 191-7

Great from KKR!!",34

Kolkata just need to take Stokes out for RR to fold like a deck of cards,4
"that says what confidence is. 
I remember once was Dhoni  failed to do, everyone was very livid",2
I just hope RR at least take this close.,5
How quickly do RR need to chase this?,7
How does a team get to 190+ with 3 ducks? RCB wants to know,9
"So one team looking to win in 15 overs , other to win by 80 runs .. not sure about numbers but give me sparta

  


Dew incomming too",6
Rahul tripathi brother of munna tripathi... Mirjapur ka shan,1
I am happy and we might finish last. Decent courage shown by the team.,4
"RR needs to win under 14 overs to get ahead of RCB, DC NRR.",2
KKR is the equivalent of Pakistan. Totally unpredictable.,13
"The way the ball seemed to be coming on to the bat after it clearly started getting wet out there around the 12th over makes me think that this total might be a good 20 runs short.

Edit: Obviously, RR could be 3 down after 6 overs and completely fuck it up, but I don't think this is anything like game over that I've seen a fair few saying here. RR just chased down 195 and 185 with so much ease in the last 2 games.",3
This is what I am talking abput. This is the intent!!! üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•,9
Stokes will have to do a Corey Andserson here. But who will be Aditya Tare?,5
If it was any other team I'd say congratulations KKR but I have learnt to never discount Ben Stokes cheaply,6
"Do RR try to win in 20 overs and hope SRH loses, or do they go guns blazing hoping to chase it down in 15 overs, wait and find out",7
"Only clueless people don't know why he turned down singles. When you have a  No. 9 on the other end that is always the right thing to do.

Even if it doesn't pay off it is still the right tactic to make sure you face more balls. in order to maximize it. 

Everybody wants to be an expert talking from hindsight after the event occurred rather than understand what  goes on in the field at that moment.",12
RR will win comfortably.,5
Brilliant knock by Morgs. Led from the front.,2
Can we all agree that Aaron is Unadkat 2.0,4
"I think with Stokes and Butler, RR should try to chase this in 15 overs.",2
Need to win in  15 overs for a confirmed spot for RR. KKR need to bowl out RR for 111,6
"Jos and Jof to open, then Samson, Uthappa, Stokes and Smith.",7
"If MI beat SRH, the winner of this should qualify",5
"If KKR wins by 80 runs and SRH wins their last match, whoever loses DC vs RCB game will be out of playoffs",12
"So much many overs does RR get to chase this, asking for MI fans",2
"There's no way we're pulling an MI and chasing this under 14 overs to guarantee a spot in the playoffs. All of our batsmen have played incredibly in the last two matches which can only mean one thing, they're all done for the season. Guys we had a good run, I'm gonna miss this team but this is the end of the line for us.",4
RR to do an MI 2014? These guys surely deserve a shot at redemption,7
RR will bottle it,8
[deleted],15
"To go through no matter what happens in the remaining games, RR has to chase before 13.3 overs and KKR has to limit RR below 110.",2
"RR basically has to do what MI did to them in 2014, not just chase 190+ but chase while saving overs to qualify with NRR",7
Unless RR do a collective Ben Chokes it shouldn't be too hard.,2
Morgan must be using Sextillion7thPower,8
RCB fans - throw your calculators away. You might need a super computer to evaluate all possible combinations:),6
I don't think RR will be able to chase it. They will get close though,0
How fast do RR have to chase this to get around RCB's NRR?,3
"I'm very sure, RR are not looking to chase down this total in whatever that magic number is (13 overs I think)

They risk losing the game if they do that",9
191 in 15 overs. Where have I seen that before?,5
"**KKR's inns**

0-5 ov 43 runs RR 8.6

"At this point, both teams should forget about NRR and play to win. Then hope DC or BLR lose big and SRH lose to MI.",4
Rahul Tripathi sounds like Sambit Patra,2
I would bank on either RCB or DC to shit the bed and lose badly. So try to win in 17-18 overs is also fine.,9

MI chased 190 Vs RR in 14.3 overs to qualify. Today RR need to chase 192 in 13.5,12
Tewatia is the find of the tournament IMO,9

"Even if we lose,  i am happy to see the kkr i know",9
This is going to be like MI vs RR game from 2014.Exciting.Can Ben Stokes be Corey Anderson for Rajasthan Royals?,6
KKR scored 97 off the final 8. Excellent finishing under adverse circumstances at 99/5.,5
"RR shouldn't lose going for the guarantee imo. The win is a little more important given that SRH is playing MI. 

They should look to chase around the 17-18th over to give themselves a fighting chance over the loser of DC RCB.",3

"Neroli Meadows is right, it is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!!",3
"Forget chasing it in 15 overs, RR should just focus on winning this. Take deep if that's what it takes",4
"The way Morgan played today, it has brought me back to the same old question. 




Do we even have any real big hitters anymore? 



* Naysayers and ""experts"" have successfully ruined Pant. 



* the moment his partner even sneezes, Rahul goes into the shell and his SR drops.



* Iyer hits spinners well but the moment they pull their length back, he struggles to hit them.



* We never know about Pandey. Some days he goes 50(30) some days he is  30(31). Also, dont forget the lack of variety in number of shots that he plays. 



* Rohit seems okay, he can hit out when reqd. 



* Kohli and Dhawan again, are some days hot some days cold. There are days when these 2 cant go wrong and then there are days when they can hit out of the circle to save their lives. Although time and again Kohli has shown he does eventually shifts gears after spending some time on the crease. 



* Dube mistimes half of the shots that he plays.",10

This thread is so funny. Some are saying all it will take for KKR to win is getting Stokes out while others are saying RR should look to finish the chase in 15 overs. Excited for the second innings.,9
If RR go for that mental Target they could end up playing into KKR's hands and end up cattling out for 110,6

Looking at both teams RR chasing it down in 15 overs and KKR bowling out RR under 111 both scenarios are quite possible!,4
Rajasthan‚Äôs entire bowling is carried by a Twitter merchant and a Haryanvi boi,20
It would be hilarious if RR lose trying to chase this in 13.5 overs and then SRH also lose,9
Is it just me or the score and situation reminds anyone else of 2014 MI-RR match. More than once RR has been on the receiving side in playoff place deciders. Can they do it today?,3

It's worth simply looking to chase it down and bet on MI beating SRH? What am I missing here?,7
I'm hoping Samson can step up to the occasion here. It would be a great storyline if he can pull his team through within 14 overs,4
13.2 is the exact required overs right?,2
"RR should go for it. Buttler, Stokes, Samson, and of course Tewatia can whack the ball. Archer too.",2
RR should just look forward to win. Going with the mindset to chase this as early as possible will be the downfall.,1
"I always thought, in THAT mi RR 2014 game, why didn't they just use their 4 best bowlers for those 14 overs? Like even if you bowl out your best bowler in the 14th, it wouldn't matter even if you lost as you would've qualified",11

"At present its better being kkr prolly

Runs on the board in pressure game

We can also win by 40/50 runs if we get early wicket rather than rr chasing down in 16 17",2
Good thing KKR changed captains. Morgan really played a captain's role today.,1
Scenario isn‚Äôt that complicated. A win for either side would almost book their chances for the play offs. SRH doesn‚Äôt stand much of a chance against MI. And RCB/DC game could turn out one sided.,6
"KKRs game now. That was some pretty bad death bowling from Stokes ngl. Happy that Tyagi got into the wickets though, but the score was 20 runs higher than it should‚Äôve been.",3
Please RR just win this no matter how many overs. If you go hard and lose I bet KKR will eventually qualify with MI beating SRH. I don't want to see that.,5

Buttler Stokes Sanju Smudge Tewatia should be the batting order imo if they are to pull this off,2

Wtf is cummins doing lmao,1
If i were the RR batsmen I would simply hit a 6 every ball until the target is chased to ensure the max possible NRR,7
"GG Robin, need 31 more of those.",1
Why does scorecard show 6-1?!,4
There is only one thing you should not do in front of Robin. Do NOT bowl into his pads. WTF is Cummins doing.,4

Anyone else reminded of Headingley????,5
Yeah well placed Stokesy,3

"Okay, kkr we know you hate us but this is too harsh. Think about us also a little thanks",2
"Excuse me good sir, WHAT THE FUCK?",4
How many overs to beat DC in NRR.,1
Today possibly could be last chance for Cummins to prove he's still best Fast LOI Bowler or else it's Bumrah for now.,0
Fuckin hell the madlads are going double or nothing,1
Kkr and RR need to win by how much margin? Pls tell :),1

Hope we don't lose tomorrow now :(",1
"It seems we're going for it guys. 
14.1 overs to beat SRH. 13.2 overs for RCB.",0
Fuck they're on it,4
DON'T YALL FUCKING JINX,1
It's a great thing when your 16 crore marquee signing bowler can get you a fantastic economical start like this,4
Why would RR *not* go for it?,3
I am so horny right now.,2
These madlads are actually trying for the nrr win,3
That‚Äôs gonna beat the biggest first over in IPL,2

Lmao wtf is going on,1
Cummins will single handedly lose KKR this match,4
game over for rr,2
6 (2) the true t20 innings,6
Bahahahaha,1
At this rate RR can win in 10 overs.. even if they keep losing 1 wicket each over,13
Thanks Uthappa. You remembered your real team.,5
This over is on par with Nortje 156 over but without pace- change my mind,4
"Bye bye robbie

Just need 3 more cummo",4
Uthappa with the 300 strike rate,3
Should have been put away again,1
Stupid shot,1
Lol,1
300 SR is pretty decent from Robbie,4
"WTF! RR looking to go on a kill mode, and showing intent to chase this within 13.4 overs. Scary.",4
Uthappa - 6 and wicket.,4
Why is Uthappa the way that he is,1
"Oh, Uthappa is out. That's alright. Sorta relieved",3
Damn RR give some chance to RCB/DC NRR please,3
Uthappa did an Afridi today,2
It was fun while it lasted,1
No 100 from Robbie :(,2
Why Uthappa why :(,2
Uthaapa SR 300 üòÇüòÇ,8
That's ok from Uthappa atleast he did not was any balls.,3
Cummins what are you doing lmao.,2
Still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great ball lmao,2
Any reason Mark Nicholas keeps going on about how the Royals need to up their NRR don‚Äôt they go to 4th if they win with only Hyderabad able to pass them who need to beat the top team?,6
Robin being the samson,5
"~~I hope this over isnt just an aberration and RR is actually going for the kill. Be the master of your fate instead of praying someone beats someone else.~~

This wicket changes everything :(",7
Don't do that RR you need to win don't care about NRR. SRH loss will matter alot.,8
Samson passed the Six and Out curse to Uthappa,10
There are only 2 outfielders you've to avoid in the PP bro.,4
600sr Bumrah > fraud,6
"By current rate

RR - 190/10 in 10 Overs

KKR win by 1 run",64
Tell them to calm down and just get the W,8
Six And Out,6
Smudge just relax and build a partnership first please fuck,5
Why why why Uthappa already 19 an over,4
Y'all strike rate lovers must be happy with this innings,13
It's a shame that while Koach is in power 300 SR players like Uthappa will continue to be out of the team for 120 SR hacks like Iyer and Pandey,6
It went from 100-0 real quick,8
That‚Äôs just such a stupid shot to get out,7
So 120 odd all out is also on the cards,4
"Six and out, Samson virus is spreading in RR",6
Uthappa still faithful to kkr,17
How fucking stupid is Uthappa,2
Is it bad that I‚Äôm having MI vs RR 2014 flashbacks?,2
RR on target for 190/10 in 10 overs,6

SRH boys who do we support in this match?,3
"U already have 19 runs in an over. Why would u do that, you arent chasing this in 14 overs",7
Dew is gonna fuck kkr bad,6
RR just win this and hope MI beats SRH üòÖ,6
Imagine RR: 140 all out in 7 overs,11
Robbie 300 SR innings. T20 LEGEND,16
The audience in the IPL has been getting more and more... Guess teams are getting more people to cheer up.. In the first match there hardly anyone but now there almost 20-30 in there,9
I cannot handle another 2014 heist,11
[deleted],0
"I don‚Äôt know a lot about Pat, I must admit. But I know there was a lot of hype about him going into this IPL . He hasn‚Äôt lived up to his hype. Is he not really a T20 bowler, or has he just had a poor competition?.",13
Score card showed 6-1 by mistake.That was uttapa's run/s,5
Good job r/cricket now see a collapse happen,6
Inb4 stokes 100(40) and samson 75(27),13
Lol inb4 rr all out,5
"**0.6** Cummins to Uthappa, OUT, and what cricket. Every match should be played with an eye on NRR. Just big hits and wickets. Uthappa plays the pick-up shot again to a full ball, but this time he is dragging it from outside off, which means he needs more power. He hasn't imparted it, and he has found the man at deep backward square leg **19-1**

RV Uthappa c Nagarkoti b Cummins 6 (2b 0x4 1x6) SR: 300.00",3
Either put full power into it or flick it for single,3
Wow what a story of Stokes Sr.,6
"Guys, Uthappa plays really well .... for the other team",7
Where is samsung,3
Straight up stupid to go for chasing down the target in under 14 overs. Or is it uthappa being irresponsible in a chase?,2
Wow great story about Stokes' father,8
Everyone asking in how many overs RR need to win to get that NRR boost. Reverse question - inside how many overs to KKR need to bowl RR out for the reverse to apply?,7
192 in how many overs?,3
Guess RR's desperate to chase down the total,3
"as a RCB fan, I keep reminding myself that all we need to do is win the last game and not rely on other teams to make it to the playoffs.",5
Why do the commentators keep thinking even if RR win that they are still pretty much out?The NRR won't be that far behind DC who could easily get beaten heavily and SRH have to beat the best team in the tournament.,3
I am not confident man.. We might collapse,6
I think in about 90 minutes Bmac will throw his diary like Dravid threw his cap in 2014.,10
Where is Samson wtf,7
Stokes's father is a madlad. Cut his middle finger to play rugby.,7
The pat Cummins sister story again.,2
We gave them that wicket to save Cumdog‚Äôs integrity,5
Second innings starting....wake me up when this ends ...my heart is not ready for this....,4
Wow that's 10% of the total done in 6 balls,6
Shivam 6ix9ine Mavi. Fuck this snitch.,6
I thought Ben Stokes is a MadLad but his father is the OG.,6
Oh look look . . . a dot ball,7
How many overs do they need to finish this match for RR to beat Dc's NRR,2
"Ball ain't swinging and batsmen are going hard, 1st slip is almost useless",2
Robin Uthappa more like Braindead Uthappa am i right?,1
Calm ya pants RR. Just do tuk tuk no need to go all blazing and shit the bed,4
What is this 14 over thing about? Will that bring RR over DC's current NRR?,4
"From Cricbuzz:
Scenario now:
- Loser is knocked out
- To go past DC's NRR: KKR should win by 75 runs, RR should win by 14.1 overs
- To go past RCB's NRR: KKR should win by 79 runs, RR should win by 13.4 overs",8
DJ should play Marlon chants,2
"Anyone who's played cricket will know, it was a good shot to play for that ball just the execution didnt come off.",4
"So here's some math for you:

KKR need to win by 81 runs or more tonight to go past RCB and DC on net run rate

If RR want to do that, they need to chase down the target in 13.2 overs or less

Smith is powerplay? I hope he doesn‚Äôt go wacky,2
how is this wide?,3
19 after  1.2 overs so 192 after 13 overs. RR on track to qualify.,3
That was a harsh call,4

Stokes is looking truly clueles here,-2

Is dew not playing that big a role?,2
"Even if this match is close, the winner of this match can still qualify if RCB vs DC is one sided",2
There's a chance of big loss tomorrow so 16 over wicket might be a good thing for RR.,3
Wtf was that noise from Mark Nicholas,1
Don't fucking get run out,2
Russell and Pollard have played more IPL games compared to t20 and odi matches for wi cricket... I think soon there's should add quota added allowing 5th overseas player names IPL overseas player.,1
WTF RR. Already dropped the 14 over win idea?,3
Mavi fumbled,6
Speaking of 2014 why wasn't Uthappa able to make a comeback in the national team,3
That was a run out my dear,5
Should have let nagarkoti collect it,2
DK calling stokes name. Aww,3
Missed a runout chance,5
Smith tryna get Stokes out just like how he got Samson out last game,2
whats the story about stokes' dad?,1
"It must be kept in mind that the same equations apply equally to tomorrow's match too... KKR could win by 40 runs instead of 80, but RCB could also lose by 40, making up the NRR gap",3
Okay um give me a heart attack I guess,3
Lmao what was that,2
This is one chase where dots balls actually  are gold dust for the fielding side,5
Did he just miss the run out ?,10
"Smith you clown, again trying to run your team mates out",7
That could have been out. What are they doing????,3

Stokes in some brilliant form!,2
Stokes is literally the only guy in this lineup I can trust with this chase,2

yeah rr has lost this...i can feel the haste to complete this run chase..they'll mess up because of the haste,-3
Brought to you by **LENSKART**^TM,4
classic shot,1
I have a feeling they asked Stokes and Robin to go all guns blazing until one goes out and they will just try to win this by going deep,2
Poor throw I think.,0
Smith fucker is gonna get someone run out again.,2
What do you guys think was the rationale behind promoting Smith?,1
"I thought to myself

*What if DC loses 5 matches in a row?*

And that's exactly what's gonna happen tomorrow",6
"Don't worry RR, DC is going to whoop us.",2
Goddamn. Buttler is so wasted in this RR team. No offense to the fans but fuck RR.,11
This is not good for my heart ffs,7
Omg DK,1
The RR is still 13 lol,5
Now that's what I call intent‚Ñ¢,1

Are the crowd noises we hear pre recorded? Or is there a decent sized crowd there atm? It sounds weird.,1
Mccullum will throw cap today,4
"Come on KKR. Remember, in 2015 when he had to chase 200 against RR, but we lost by 9 runs in the final match. Losing that match meant KKR were knocked out. KKR will have revenge on the mind, by not only knocking out RR but qualifying themselves too.",2
This tournament is only interesting because of the incompetence of DC and RCB which I am not sure is a good thing lol. And at least one of those fucks will actually make the playoffs is seriously a joke at this point.,3
DC's gotta open with Stoinis tomorrow,2
What a catch,1
"RR should aim for a 16 over chase

Go for the kill and bowl Cummo out,3
"No RR doesn't necessarily have to chase in 13-14 overs to stay in contention for playoffs. Tomorrow's match RCB vs DC will also bring the losers net run rate down.

Why would you send a leg spinner at 3 tho?,3
At this rate Cummins is going to have figures of 6-48 after his 4 overs. KKR will take it with any given day.,4
That is why you pay him big bucks!!,2

Rr if you want to win next season dont retain smith unadkat rajpoot and aaron pls,1
CUMGOD,2

"I mean, team doing well, versus team doing absolute dogshite. The switcheroo in this match was inevitable",3

Time for Buttler to reaffirm everyone of his world class status,2
"Give Varun one over please, have a feeling he will get Buttler today",1

"**2.6** Cummins to Smith, OUT, oh the adrenalin is flowing. Cummins gets his former captain. Again he nearly beats the inside edge of the shuffling Smith. The last time the inside edge saved him from a dead lbw. This time it drags the ball from outside off to top the of the leg stump **32-3**

SPD Smith  b Cummins 4 (4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",1
Alright bois - how much margin should KKR beat RR to stay in playoffs hunt,2

That‚Äôs it. Pat Cummins is showing the world why he was paid so much money. Big match player,2
Rcb and DC praying RR to at least score 110 now lol,1
This match is setup for the Lord to show his greatness,1
Relatively new to IPL but I'm loving the dynamics. Smith facing off against Australian teammate Cummings. Smith partenering with ashes rival Stokes. Apart from every team winning that I bet against.,1
Get out the Cummins apology thread ffs :'(,3
Game went from rr going for a nrr win and kkr just trying not to lose to rr trying not to lose and kkr going for the nrr victory in a couple minutes lmao,5
Now thats a comeback by Cummins goddamn,3
Lets go KKR,4
Smith has got to be the most overrated t20 Player ever. Crazy that Rajasthan give 12 crores to him when guys like Hales Lewis Munro go unsold.,3
"First 5 balls for 19 runs. 

Next 7 balls 5 runs + 3 wickets


Comeback Cummo",5
Stage set for Lord Tewatia to be the undisputed universal Lord today,5
"My goodness Cummins. What an outrageous showing. Give up 24 runs in 2 overs in the power play .... but get 3 wickets?

Absolute mad lad.",4
Smith has been terrible this season as a captain and very average as a batsman - the average Indian domestic bat could have pulled off his numbers,5
"Time for a big Jos innings, I reckon.",4
"So what's the game plan, RR?",1
"As a Kiwi fan, why the fuck do I hate Ben Stokes so much but absolutely dig Morgan.",7
"There is still Buttler, the Lord, Parag and Archer left. And the required rate is 9.5 not impossibly high. RR are still in the game.",7
"RR, 150 atleast!! Pleaseeeee. Humble request from RCB fan.",4
Smith's weakness should be noted by the Indian team.,2
2-0 know your place leg spinner!,3
Only cummins can cum at the right time,3

"Kolkata needs to keep their tails up, Samson and butler can still take this game deep",1
"Is Buttler gonna be rr's Corey Anderson

Or will it be lord?",3
Well RR ain't no MI for a reason,4
RR please score above 120. Atleast for DC and RCB's sake.,7
What's the wooden spoon?,1
This doesn't look too good rn. Lord Tewatia is the incoming?,3
We talked about peaking during the wrong time but have we talked about choking during one?,3

Swanny‚Äôs probably imploding rn,7
Cumming coming in clutch,2
9D Chess by Smith to make sure his Arch Rival Kohli doesn't come 2nd.,11
RR losing at the rate of one wicket per over,3
Kudos to RR for giving catching practice to DK,8
Rajasthan Royals have awoken the real Pat Cummins.,8
Henceforth it will be Nalla Bol not Halla bol,3
Why do an MI when you can do a RCB instead?,10
"Why fear? 

Lord Tewatia is here.",3
Lmao so SRH won‚Äôt be guaranteed a place by only a win,0
Imagine if Cummins didn't go for 19 in the first over.. that RCB 49 would be in real danger then lmao,6
Swann must be dying inside,6
India is screwed in the test series. Cummins is just getting into form.,9
"Tewatia in.

Unlucky KKR, maybe next year",10
"ok, Tables turned!! are RR getting out below 111?",6
To all the RCB and DC fans rejoicing the KXIP victory would have gotten a huge shock from this KKR bowling.. There's big chance kkr might end up going above dc and rcb in nrr,8
"Cumeth the day cumeth the man, good one swanny",12
And to think Cummins gave away 19 runs in the first over,12
5 overs 5 wickets BIG YIKES,9
"Cummins justifies his price tag when it's needed.
Mad lad.",15
Lord struggles against spin. Can he prove otherwise today?,3
After few more overs....the ball will do nothing and skid on...with the dew...no one will be there to make use of it,6
KKR after the first over: Call an ambulance! *but not for me*,53
Just 154 more needed for Super Over.,7
"KKR qualifying is the best news for Mumbai

If you know, you know ;)",9
"I was literally gone for 15 minutes, how the hell did they go down 5?",9
Imagine winning the toss and losing the match,3
"Nothing but love for RR and....





Fuck TWATtia",8
About 50 percent of runs came in first 5 balls.,12
Only the Lord can save RR now. Literally üòÇ,7
A little too much for the Lord,3
"Get fucked RR, lets go KKR",2
"Damn so RR comprehensively beat MI (only ones to do so this season) just to get kicked off like this, that 2014 hate boner of their still stands",6
"Two legends, the mystery spinner vs Tewatia",2
"KKR has a horrible NRR, just checked it's - 0.47. They can only proceed with the help of a miracle.",6
[removed],4
"If RR scores between 110 and 162, CSK, RCB and DC fans will be elated lol",3
What a stupid decision to go at it hard. They needed to chase in 14.1 overs to even get near DC's NRR. Simply getting the points meant that they'd have depended on SRH v MI match which SRH are more likely to lose given MI's strength. They'd have qualified then.,5
"Inside edge that doesn't chop on?

Lord has arrived",2
How much should KKR win by to go above RCB/DC in the table?,1
"If Tewatia wins it from here, he should be squeezed into our T20 team for Aus",4
Wtf RR what are u doing,4
DK's comments are litüòÇüëåüèΩ,4
Started Supporting RR after Punjab's exit today. Next up SRH,5
If Tewatia hits 100 today I'll delete my account,10
Sorry RCB and DC fans :(,6
Rr has to score 120 to avoid follow on.,8
49 all out?,1
Narine has still now bowled a single over. It's over for RR unless Lord and buttler pull a miracle but please take it deep.,2
Tewatia is the epitome of it's not over till it's over. Keep the hopes up RR fans,3
"Dew factor, but noone there to capitalize on it. What a tragedy for RR!!!",6
Damn looks like 2 form teams in the IPL are going out now,3
This might be the very first time that the top 3 wicket takers are actually the best 3 bowlers in the league (looking at you Andrew Tye).,9
Had to wait 14 games for this! Steady start with Gill and finish by Morgan and Russell and then Cummins running through the top order. If we get a big enough win it will be worth the wait!,19
High chances of RCB/DC not getting into playoffs,9
how has the powerplay not ended?,3
Lord in today inside powerplay. Expect a lord innings from him.,3
KKR doing PARKOUR,4
"Royals batsmen saying to the next one ""Yeh tum kar lo""",5
"Someone make a mental health support thread for KXIP, RR, RCB, DC fans üòøüòøüòøüòøüòø",13
"From last to 2nd, how the fricking turntables",5
A mi vs rcb/dc qualifier? So a mi vs?? Finals,4
Pat was dew this performance (sorry),7
"I have no sympathy for DC or RCB. In fact they both need to be out of the play offs for me.

Shambolic display by both teams in the last few games.

Well done KKR to ensure at least one of them is out!",6
RR- When is dew coming?,6
"Somewhere in my gut, I get this feeling that Tewatia is oddly mediocre. Also want KKR to clap that ego back to square 1 so bad",7
lol at kkr fans thinking they can still win this with tewatia in,10
This kind of loss was in order. KKR deserve to thrash Rajastan here,2
"Cummins taketh, Cummins giveth",3
how much does kkr need to beat them by to get over SRH's nrr?,2
"Why is KKR such a hard-to-like team? 

Seriously I tried so hard, but no dice.",2
DK channeling his inner Pant,2
That shouting scared the shit out of Nagarkoti more than the batsman,3
And CSK are getting the wooden spoon after this result :/,6
F YOU RAJASTHAN DON‚ÄôT SCREW US UP AS WELL.,8
Just came back from dinner and wtf is this 41/5?,6
"If SRH lose to MI, then both RCB and DC will go to playoffs. No dead rubbers in this IPL. Nice",4
If srh lose won't rcb and dc both make it into the play-offs?,2
Warner getting a birthday gift as a win. Srk getting a birthday gift as a win. Please may DD come instead of DC so that Koach will play a match on his birthday.,8
What margin does KKR have to win by,3
Moral of the story : RR ain't MI,2
[removed],-2
Can't imagine being a DC or RCB supporter right now lol. The frustration is real.,13
If RR win this I will send gold to 500 random people.,8
"After first 5 balls, I definitely wasn't expecting 5 wickets at 35",7
KKR fan happy with Cummins- Calm                                               KKR fan realising he is gonna be retained for 15.5cr- *Panik*,8
Im gonna go cry in the corner now. See you next year RR,3
"Game over man, game over.",2
"If I could create a random IPL team

Cummins ensured RR collapse faster than I cum with Cummins in wooden cabinet,5

For KKR to beat RCB they need to restrict rr to 112. Difficult but possible,3
"Stupid RR, at least fight for 7th spot.",6
"Imagine if 1st over had gone economically, this'd have been 25-30 odd for 5 in PP",2
As KXIP fan this is satisfying as hell for me to see this .,3

He ends his 3rd over with 4 wickets for 29.",9

Dinesh Kartik lmao,5
"No dew to be seen, at least by the scoreline.",3
RR atleast reach 150 pleaseeee,5
Call me too optimist but I refuse to give up till buttler stays on crease.,16
Looks like RR won't qualify to comfort Csk and at this rate even take the 8th  position,3
"first kxip now rr...

Why tf is DK talking in Tamil to Narine,14

Such an anti-climax",5
Lord tewatia reverse sweeping? We are in for a treat today,8
Poor Jofra he‚Äôs been so good throughout the tournament. It‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs stuck with this team,13
I will take a MI defeat in the finals if tewatia and buttler pull it off from here.,13
"Some jitters in the RCB and DC fan base. If RR go down and go down big, KKR will finish with a superior NRR. Should SRH win their last game, the loser of RCB-DC will be knocked out! My my, how things have taken a dramatic turn - Cricbuzz",16
I wish there was a live points table where NRR is calculated on the go lol. with different scenarios. ie what if KKR wins? what if RR wins? etc,13
Overseas players have been unbelievably good in second half of the tournament.,7

Nagarkoti next?,5
Is there any others instance in the Ipl where a team lost 5 wickets in the pp?,12
One of the greatest T20 finishers of all time at the crease along with Jos Buttler,5
To get the ball wet quickly ..they need to hit the ball into the outfield more frequently...run lots of 2s,3
"Tmrws match, chasing team would have two targets one to qualify one to win the match.",3
Entirety of KKR fan base cummed watching Cummins 's spell.,7
Narine builds pressure and vc gets the wickets after his over. They work so well together. Best spin partnership this ipl,2
"DK shouting: bahot ache, ball geela hai ball geela hai...bahot ache...

*T: There is considerable dew out there*",3
TWATtias team can rot at bottom of the table for all I care. Shame that it had to be RR,-1
We didn't see bazz with his book today. Did we?,1
"Team: takes quick wickets or scores quick runs

112 is the target,1
"Even if KKR don't manage to win by 80 runs, they'll still win by a huge margin and the loser of RCB vs DC is bound to drop some on NRR, KKR have pretty good chances",7
Can Lord Tewatia save RCB and DC???,5
I have a feeling Buttler and the Lord can still take them to the qualifiers,6
Come on get them all out. Lord Tewatia is a devil in death overs.,5
Who would have thought of this 12 overs through first innings,3
"It‚Äôs when they lose wickets quickly like this that you realise how ridiculously strong the Royals lineup is. 

Anyhoo. I got to see Stokes score a cracking century and a half-century. I‚Äôm a happy lad even if they go out.",6

Why is kkr chilling? If we get them all out as quick as possible it's guaranteed spot for us,12
"Imagine MSD making that spark remark after 2ns match, CSK would still be playoff contention",6
It'll be hilarious if any one out of RCB and DC crash out despite being in top 4 for most of the season. Please KKR destroy RR.,13
Hope Rajasthan gets to 130,4
Why are KKR not going for the Kill? Just give finish off overs of Varun/Narine/Cummins and hope you get them under 110,4

"rr should make more than 116 and lose, so they take kkr down with them.",11
honestly i cant give a fuck anymore i really wanna cry but cant help but watch the match it really is dreadful,8
"U can't get the lord out, sorry lads

Best chance is to make everyone else out",5
When the LORD hits it even 3 people can't catch it,10
That was intentional from the Lord. Placing it perfectly between 3 fielders,10
"If RR ends up releasing Smith, which team will even need to buy him? SRH, KKR, MI have relatively settled overseas combinations. DC might want someone a bit more reliable than Hetmeyer but they already have Iyer. CSK might want a Watson replacement. RCB might want a buffer between Kohli and ABD. But no team is desperate for an overseas accumulator.",11
"Super slow stream. 

But don't know why Commentators hype stuff up. 

It doesn't matter if kkr win by 89 runs and reach to the second spot on the table. 

The next game is DC and RCB, the winner of which would be the second regardless.",10
Some hero needs to bowl 6 crisp bouncers aimed right at Twats helmet.,0
RR desperately wants to get all out under 100.,0
Cummins made a good comeback after being hit for 19 in the first over,7
And just like that both the Underdog teams KXIP and RR are pretty much out :(,5
At this rate looks like RR will end up with the wooden spoon this year!!,2
"Why're they not having a slip for fast bowler like Nagarkoti? Even for spinner, they need to have a slip in.",2
"No worries, from the interviews and comments from Jos Buttler I have heard that he's a huge MSD fan and apparently he like his BATDEEP approach too.. So don't worry rcb and DC fans...",11

"Bring back Cummins , these 2 getting comfortable",5
Can't imagine how many people failed no nut November with that shot from lord,7
How much does RR have to score to not finish last?,2
Incredible arm by tripathi - almost on par with baseball out fielders,6
RR needs 163 or more to not get the wooden spoon. Very unlikely now. CSK is not finishing last.,3
59 in 72. Should be easy,2
Dont worry guys. Lord and Buttler gonna do this.,5
"Knowing LORD and our decision making , games not over yet",7
by how much should RR lose by for CSK to move to No.7? I think 40 runs is enough to put RR at the bottom.,2
Such ease,2
Parag with a 0 from 7 balls. That's gotta hurt.,7
come on!! everyone start bashing tewatia,4
Smith out for 4... bet he'll be in perfect form by the time the next Ashes comes around though,7

KKR don't have many experienced death options.only one overs from Cummins. This match is still very much on,3

Atleast we got above 49 üôè,7
"DK you fool , shouts should only be in Tamil no matter the bowler",8
Batting Buttler at 5 when you need to win with a massive run rate is one of the shittest captaincy/leadership decisions I think I've ever seen. He's batting when the game is totally dead when he's arguably the most destructive t20 bat in all of cricket AND he does it opening the batting,7
KKR needs to get RR all out before 113 right?,6
127 in 67 with Jos The Boss and Lord Tewatia.Seems possible.,4

"Sunny G, DC and RCB can't breathe easy, they have to make sure they don't lose by a lot",8
Runs above 112 is the number of runs by which RCB can afford to loose to DC.,5
Why is Smith coming along? Going to tell the batsmen don't bat like me??,5

"Pommie‚Äôa ODI stats:

Batting average: 4.85

Bowling average: 103.65",3
God that lic ad is cringe,8
"So what changes do RR need to make for the future? They have bags of talent but too many gaps and no coherent plan it seems. I would swap Smith for a quality pace bowler (if they want to go full England then Wood, Plunkett or Willey would strengthen their team). Get Pathan and Pujara in maybe. Feels like they need a better spinner too. I know teams tend to stay national for spinners but is it time to spread the net wider? Zampa or Rashid? I dunno, they need to do something.",3
"Scenario now:

- Loser is knocked out

- To go past DC's NRR: KKR should win by 75 runs, RR should win by 14.1 overs

"After the MI vs Kxip, it was decided by the approval of all captains that if a super over gets tied and it gets started after 8PM IST(day game) or 12 PM IST(night game).

Buttler really does not want to give us the confirmed playoff spot even if RR don't win this game.,5

"**10.4** Varun to Buttler, OUT, huge wicket. Buttler is gone. And now KKR can look for the big margin. Legcutter, bowled fast, Buttler gets the length to pull but this one skids on hurries him into the shot. He has found deep midwicket to perfection **80-6**

JC Buttler c Cummins b Varun 35 (22b 4x4 1x6) SR: 159.09",1
There goes the Rutherford's gold foil like thin sliver of hope that RR had,8
RCB will be in the Play offs and then lose. Pretty cool.,1

Now this would be a hot take but Uthappa should have tapped that ball for a single instead of going berserk on that. Already 19 had come you were well over the rate for 13 overs also. Other batsmen were there yes but he should have stayed till the PP,3
Gopal has 4 first class hundreds,7
:(,1
Morgan going for the kill,1
"RR need 31 more runs. 

C'mon RR!",6
Morgan is spot on today.,2
Why do Rajasthan do so well against teams at the top and in form but so shoddy against the bottom ones and those not in form,6
with that guard when buttler walks - he prolly has a big bat hidden,1
RR will go 100 for 8 then all out for 120 just to make it interesting.,3
Honestly these two teams don't deserve to be in top 4,2
ffs RR you just had to get close,3
RCB and DC should hope that RR makes 30 more runs,3
Is it just me or does anyone else absolutely loathe Rajasthan Royals?,5
"Feels like RR know they are out of it, so they are doing what they can, so KKR won't make it either",5
Where is that Lord Tewatia innings when you need it the most,2
Gopal can bat???,1
How much should rr score to avoid 8th place?,3
If kkr doesn‚Äôt win by 79 then regardless they need srh to lose right ?,1

RR doesn't deserved it anyway,1
RCB & DC are best friends we both will play for superover & will decide who gets to play Qualifier by Superover,7
"Oh great, I just moved from my sofa to go to the toilet and Buttler gets out!",5
It takes just one match to change the fortunes. Hope RCB and DC plays with this mentality tomorrow,0

RR should self destruct now just to fuck with RCB and DC,10
"Give me chintu over this coding sikho, duniya badlo shit pls. I'm so glad I will stop watching TV in a couple of days",6
KKR qualifying will make me happy but what will make me more happy is these toxic dc fans who were bitching about how dc will qualify for sure getting out or RCB's tragedy another year,8
Y no wickets to Narine,2
Its time for the lord to sleep after doing so much work single-handedly,4
RR is a perfect example that star players don‚Äôt always win you games. You can have an average team that contributes together on a relatively consistent basis get you more wins.,6

KKR will let go of Narine in the next mega auction. They have a perfect replacement in Varun,1
This is the perfect time to ask what happened to the ATG Gujarat Lions batsman Eklayva Dviwedi. He was a pretty decent middle order batsman and would've fit in many of the teams rn.,4

DC released Tewatia for this. 4D chess.,17
Can always count on Lord Tewatia to bring the fight against all odds.,2
"Brain dead captaincy. Attack, KKR. Wtf are you guys waiting for?",10
If KKR wins by say 50 runs. How much is our NRR gonna improve?,1
Boult and Morris were understandable because they had hardly done anything to justify their place in the DC side and Rabada and Nortje are better bowlers anyway. It's the Tewatia trade that is hurting DC the most here.,8
"Brain-dead by KKR, where's the short leg? Field is too open, guess they're not going for 110",2

Its basically KKR and RCB supporters on this thread now. RR fans have fucked off.,10
"How have I managed to pick the one team to support that is exactly like supporting England in the late 90s/early 00s? A core of a few players who could get into most teams in the world, but basically only ever all in form for about 1 in 10 games. Hints of a really good team, with a promising future, but with a calamity just round the corner at all times. Basically, the team is far less than the sum of its parts.... A few shite fielders always in the side stinking the place up. Absolutely no bollocks when the chips are down. 

RR and 20 years ago England.... my boys!",7
Tattia winning it for RR will ruin my day way more than kxip losing,1
"17 runs, 4 wkts",2
Lmao what's happening,1
I don‚Äôt know how many fans agree with me but I would take a shot at finishing 2 instead of sharing points to finish 3/4 even if losing means knockout. Yes finishing top 2 is that broken in the IPL.,5
Chakravarthy is a tamilian? How is he communicating with DK?,4
tewatia has been an absolute gem this season,4
Pls another 30-40 runs,7
Get them to 120 lord Tewatia,2
Narine with a doctored action is useless,8

Still not a fan of KKR ... something about that team rubs me the wrong way,11

"Have you ever seen a towards the end league match where a good win would throw an 8th placed to 2nd?

Thats how crazy this IPL has been",13
So 96 from 46,1
Even a run a ball here will take RR to 150 and make RCB and DC very happy,4
This game is perfectly set up for a tewatia innings,8

RCB or DC could still lose badly and get out off playoffs even if KKR is unable to defend 111 today and SRH wins.,5
"RCB hear me out, lets have a superover tomorrow",11
This season everyone has their calculators out. RCB fans should do an AMA on this,6
"As per Lee there rule that super over shd be completed in time otherwise points are shared between two teams , didn't know that",2
KKR's best bet is to win by 50 odd runs and hope that one of DC or RCB get battered tomorrow because Lord works in mysterious ways.,8

The less said about Andrew McDonald, the better. And Smudge has been as effective as Rahane with the bat, while being poorer in the captaincy department. Need a better Indian core in frontline bowling and batting (Robin doesn't count, nor does Sanju).",6
I remember Gopal was a pretty good pinch hitter for RR last year. Playing like a proper tail ender here,4
Why is that DJ having an orgasm while cheering for a losing Rajasthan,5
Rahul Tewatia vs Rest of the World,10
"Morgan going for Kill, gg",5

Dc are gonna absolutely fuck us tomorrow aren't they,14
That DK catch was... wow!,4
"Fuck, I was supporting RR in the beginning. Now, I want the 111 for KKR. If not 111, please defend 163.",5

The amount of RCB x DC fans support for RR is wayyy crazy today,2
"DK pulling a Pant today. In the talking department, not the keeping department, where he is miles better.",5
Byjus is a fucking snake oil scam,8
Take his wicket KKR can't look at his fuck face any longer,8
How is that not a wide?,-1
"If RR are gonna loose,at least don‚Äôt get past 163",4
Cummins has got double the wickets tonight than he did in his first 8 matches,5
"Dinesh Karthik stepping down from captaincy was huge for KKR; Morgan is a much better captain.

Now if only Kohli could set aside his ego for his team(s) and do the same ......... he's a garbage captain.",16
"I feel this needs to be Narine's last season. His bowling has been getting less effective,with every action change and isn't good enough for kuldeep to sit on the bench.",1
"If Cummins gets one more, that'll be two 5-wicket hauls for KKR this season.",7
On a serious note - tewatia does seem to be a very good no 7 player in t20.  Takes the game deep and hits many release shots . Whether he can continue to do this in the future after teams figure him out is a wholly different thing .,13
"13 runs, 4 wkts",4
KKR was 105 at this stage. What shit Bowling lmao,9
Thank God now everything feels good...RCB begging for other teams to play good to make sure they qualify kxip out rr chocking dc chocking feels like home,6
RCB winning the next match and playing against MI in Q1 and Koach hitting a 100 and pointing his bat to the Sun (Surya) epic comeback!,15
"Tewatia is an absolute IPL star in the making.  
He hit sixes, he took wickets, he fielded nicely for the most part. Pity for him that he plays for a team which takes time to get their engine warm and purring.  
  
He's a star and if he isnt retained, he will rake in the dollars in the next auction (also could be part of the second string as far as India's T20 team is concerned)",14
"People shitting on Narine, but he's been much, much better than Cummins",2
Tewatia 6 sixes ?,1
RCB DC friends today rivals tomorrow,18
"I know Mumbai might be rejoicing, but what if this is just a set up for kkr to blitze them in the playoffs.",4
Lord tewatia starts running after Gopal has already covered 3/4th of the pitch,10
Gopal is a lucky mfr,2
"11 runs, 4 wkts.",6
"So guys I'm going to be asking the real question here.

By how much should RR lose so that CSK dont get Wooden spoon?",2
Rajasthan deserve it for mistreating Jaiswal,8
"Fuck off Tewatia, please get out so KKR can skittle the tail",11
Just make 25 more runs,2
Wow just saw the score RR what you did there cutie,9
RR required now is equal to what was required initially for that 13.3 over thing.,9
Pat Cummins üëèüëèüëè,1
I jist want kohli to.miss out on playoffs,1
"For once I thought I'm having a stress free season. I expected those cunts to just make it to the playoffs, that's it and they absolutely bottled it",7
Surely Sharma would play the Q right?,3
If you‚Äôre dying to know... Tewatia needs only 16 sixes to finish this off,14
Good stuff Cummo,2
"https://twitter.com/rajasthanroyals/status/1311006767506059264?s=20

RR admin tweeted this

And now we're at risk of ending up at #8",7
Bring on Mavi and mount pressure,3
"theres a pretty high chance either of dc or rcb get knocked out tomorrow. If that happens, itll be really sad considering we both were going for top 2 lmfaoo",10
"Atleast KKR won't go to second place, that's win enough for me",7
If Tewatia manages to pull this one off (exceptionally unlikely) he should be fast tracked in the Indian team.,5
Why Gopal over Archer?,2
91 in 6 overs now to stay in IPL,1
"9 runs, 4 wkts",2
"I never thought I'd find myself saying this, but as an RCB fan I want Tewatia to take the game real close so that no matter which team wins, their NRR doesn't go up by too much.",1
"Pat Cummins: *ends 14 over*

That one diehard RR fan: Oh no, now we cant go above RCB/DC NRR.",4
So 4th place it is :(,3
Come on Lord take the score to 150,5
KKR won't go to the 2nd place now for sure,1
"Russell's wifey is cute af,looks like they make a great couple.",6
"Get Lord, please VC!",3
In thos thread most of fans right now from rcb n dc. Lol,7
"Lol, who screamed?",1
Lord playing for 111 to piss kkr off,12
Are fans allowed on stadium?,1
C'mon guys 6 runs more you can do it to cross 110,5
Is it just me or does it seem sometimes that Mark Nicolas has a delayed stream that he‚Äôs commentating to? He was a second or two behind on that Tewatia pull.,1
Its lovely how they are doing everything they can to prevent KKR from qualifying,6
[deleted],5
Seeing Chakara bowl for India will be exciting. Let's hope he does well as hes done so far in IPL.,1
"RR new strategy seems to be 'if we're going down, we're gonna take your precious NRR with us'",5
Tewatia needs to make this a big over,3
Finally Doull talking some sense with NRR and not following the gavaskar logic .,3
please 50 or something more from here rr pleaseee,2
"7 runs, 4 wkts",4
Tewatia please get out,5
Soo KKR's qualifying is guaranteed with this win right?,6
How much runs for rr to avoid wooden spoon,4
"Bruh RR need to get to 150 atleast

The NRR calculations are not taking tomorrow's margin of loss into consideration",9
"Even after 37-5, still better batting than DDüò≠",3
I'm sure Lord twetia will surely help his former team even if he fails to help his current team,4
This RR innings actually made more sense than than the last 3 DC innings. Yeah we are that bad lol.,1
Lord has been dismissed,4
Get sweating RCB fans,6
"For a match that's supposed to be high-stakes, this feels so anti-climactic and surprisingly boring.",4
hattrick now please,2
GET FUCKED TEWATIA,1
Hope lost :(,4
5 Runs to win for DC and RCB,12
Noooooooo üò≠,2
Tewatia FFS,4
Fuckoff. Why did you have to fuck this up RR,4
It was fun while it lasted,5
KKKR ftw,1
Motherfuck,3
Come on RR just score 4 more runs,2
6 runs left,3
Fuckk script writers,2

with dew around all RR had to do was not try too hard.,7
Little late boys?,4

Lmao how many catches has DK taken today?,5

Beta blockers back on the menu boyz,5
we have to take 4 wickets within 6 runs now!!! Don't give up boys!,6
No lord no no,2
Smith walking in???,8
Too late,3
6 runs with 3 wickets,1
script writers have decided that dk shall not be axed \s,14
Man DK with 4 catches..wtf,16
DC will get knocked out tommorow for sure. They played shit. It was their luck that Bravo got injured or they wouldn't even have fucking 14 points,10
Its fun when we do it. Commentators going on and on about Tewatia just ruins it tbh,11
Rajasthan is kill?,11
Well that's an end to an exciting season by Lord Tewatia. Fun times!,6
"Ight Imma eat humble pie now, Chakravarthy's been interesting and the t20 squad spot is a bit justified",8
"Even if its not a 79 run margin, anything close to that ensures a playoff spot cz the team losing in the rcb v dc match would also drop some nrr",6
Smith shitting the bed in the IPL is not good for India in the test series. I hope Kohli goes super Saiyan too.,9
Surely Jofra can hit a few sixes and get them past 160.. So that they don't end up last,4
Tewatia and Archer deserve a better team,7
Don't see why KKR fans are so sad. A non close match tomorrow takes them through,8
Easy 112,3
at least score 140 ffs,3
"After interacting to dc fans on this thread, maybe I won't be mad if they beat us tomorrow

After all we both are shit",2
"4 catches holy fuck

No one can talk to karthik wife noq",5
I think RR went with an intent to chase it down in 15-17 overs to have a great NRR. Which worked out for KKR,3
Cricketing gods want to humble Lord Tewatia for the next season,4
"Need DC or RCB to lose big tomorrow, an MI victory is even better",3
Archer hit them big sixes,1
I think the RR team will do Tequila shots during Strategic Time Out. Sound strategy,4
kisi ne sahi kaha hai - Jaat mein dimag nahi hota.,1
What is Smudge out to tell them lmao,8
"Totally got over this match, not watching it any more but I‚Äôd just like to say it‚Äôs been fun thanks for the entertainment RR, I needed this shit in my life. See ya next IPL fam",6
Lmao why are smith and mcdonalds walking to the batsman in timeout,10
I mean what is Smith going to say? He‚Äôs walking towards the pitch as if he‚Äôs got a plan.,14
"In the Strategic Timeout

RR:Let‚Äôs ensure we fuck KKR‚Äôs NRR and drag 
them down with us",8
Never thought I would say this but still play Tuk Tuk for the remaining overs.,6
Bruh kkr can go from 8th to 2nd today wut even is this season,12
21st century Nostradamus to the rescue.,4
"Idk much about nrr, but i assume any runs rr scores in excess of 111 is the margin which rcb/dc can afford to lose by?
This is assuming srh wins.",2
"*If KKR wins by margin of 75 runs and go to 2nd spot, then they are qualified for sure whether SRH wins or not. In that case, if SRH wins, the loser tomorrow misses to qualify. Wow, incredible!* 

&#x200B;

\-cricbuzz",11
The burnout,1
How many runs does KKR need to win by to get their NRR to be higher than DC/RCB?,1
RR needs to get 163 to avoid something right?,3
"I would definitely love to see the highlights now, as i am not seeing this live",3
Expecting much drama from tomorrow‚Äôs game.,2
"Varun, find of the tournament for me.  Will be cruel if he doesn't replace Kuldeep in the limited overs squad. Dude deserves a chance atleast for a couple of series.",10
Most dangerous batsman gone,3
"If kkr win by huge margin and srh wins against mi, then it wil be 5th time each other trying to knock off other out of tournament",9
Varun seems to have experience beyond his years . Seems unfazed by any situation .,4
RR I beg you play tuk tuk,7
"RR don't be a bitch. We thrashed y'all, let us go forward",7
"Even if KKR doesn't restrict RR to 116 today, tomorrow game will ensure loser takes some NRR beating and KKR can still be above the loser.",5
And this my friends is how to bowl and captain and not think of dew and toss as excuses.,3
RR need to get at least 140 for bit of luxury for RCB and DC,5
Finally the Lord can rest now,2
"Smith (probably) : Ya mate, yeet the fucking ball mate",4
Last time we saw the lord this season :'(,10
Why ending up last is even a concern?? Just qualify or don't,5
Honestly the DC team is so well covered in all bases that someone from the management should be fired already for the clusterfuck recently.,6
Guys if we win vs Mi (big if) do we qualify irrespective of today's and tomorrow's games?,14
"this season has been pretty shite, had to support csk today and gonna have to support mi day after tomorrow cuz i have complete faith in us losing horribly tomorrow",28
"All these megacharting permutations and combinations are only relevant if Hyderabad beats Mumbai in the last game, which even if Mumbai rest their starters, isn't necessarily easy. Otherwise, the playoffs are set with all of MI, RCB, DC, and KKR making it, which were the four teams who were easily ahead at the halfway point. In the end Punjab and Rajasthan just gave everyone else a bit of a scare.",13
Shaw has been absolute shit against pace. Wonder what Bangar is smoking,4
I prefer Chakravarty over Kuldeep,6
"dc (first half) : hamare sath finals main kon khelega,bolo?

dc now (second half) : ek match jeetne do please, knockouts jaana hai.",15
Hattrick here would be peak RCB moment,7
"gg KKR. Let's be honest, RR with that bowling attack doesn't deserve to be in the playoffs",5
"11 runs 3 wickets.

KKR can still go past DC if RR is restricted to 116.",3
"If we win tomorrow, can have two bites at the cherry. But if we lose and SRH wins, we can happily crash out and not get embarrassed by Varun Chakravarty again. Positives.",4
"5 runs, 3 wkts.",2
There was way too much for him to do anyway. Look forward to seeing Tewatia in the next season !,7
Can we have a situation where both SRH and KKR qualify and RCB is out?,5
Out of Topic : What is something in umpire's hand that he presses sometimes ?,3
[deleted],8
Jofra just score 20 for RCB,6
Kumble would have caught that,1
"On one hand I want kkr to win handily so dc vs rcb becomes very interesting but I also want rr to take it deep so they don‚Äôt get the wooden spoon, csk does",2
Is it 111 or 116 for them to not take second?,2
Gopal will play for India if he takes RR to 140 somehow,3
KKR qualifying is a strong possibility now. Stronger than RCB/DC. Because one of them will definitely shit the bed.,14
Gopal doing a good impression of how I would bat if they send me out there.,6
Srh pls win on Tuesday,4
"Dive VC, dive!",2
Batriarchy confirmed if Morgan is MoTM and not Cummins,7
So if KKR win we're wooden spooners?,10
Tewatia struggles against spin. Should have played out Chakravarthy and tonked Mavi and Nagarkoti to have a chance.,4
"4 runs, 3 wkts",5
"The Architect, alright that's gonna be the nickname for Chakara",1
That would have been a c&b but the beard held him back,5
So the only possibility of having a new winner is the team that wins in RCB DC match,5
"Come on RR you already lost, just give us the playoff spot",5
Get Archer please!,2
WHAT THE FUCK 2 matches ago if you'd told me we'd need to whip out our calculators again,10
CSK the only team that got eliminated with a smile,8
The same team on winning by a good margin could climb upto the 2nd soon and also on losing by a large margin could go to the last position of the points table. Shows how good and competitive this season of Ipl has been,7
"Wanted KXIP>RR>RCB>SRH to qualify in that order

Fuck me",10
Sad that we won't see any more Archer blitz this season.,5
6 rune,1
"So KKR was 4th a few weeks back, craziness ensues, and they land back at 4th yeah? Full circle",7
Weird!! DK is in shit form as batsman but in prime form as a keeper.,5
RCB and DC should make a deal to drag the match out to a Super over and then let the best team win. That way both will qualify!!!. They should use the *Never won an IPL* brotherhood pact!!!,9
Suddenly sub turned into math class üòÇ,10
RCB and DC can qualify if the match is abandoned. Maybe the script production team can manufacture a sandstorm tomorrow.,18
Expecting atleast 5 or 6 sixes from archer.,3
"Does anyone know who the commentator with an Indian background (think he's English based on his accent but not 100% certain) is on BBC radio commentary?

"~~2~~ 3 runs, 3 wkts",3
"Hey any playoff equation expert!?

Please tell me now what it exactly takes RCB and DC to surely qualify for playoffs irrespective of their NNR?",2
Get Russell an over maybe?,1
Pls reach 130 leave us some margin to lose,8
"From mi,dc,rcb,kxip expectations

To mi,rcb/dc,srh,kkr (hopefully)

So that there is only one team that hasn't won ipl, feel bad for underdog supporters",8

what if DC/RCB match too is a big margin loosing game for one of the teams?,1
"Rcb and dc fans what are your predictions for tomorrow

How do you think your respective teams would fuck up

Let's compare who's more shit",4
Scenes if Hattrick Wicket ü§£ü§£,1
Can I do my calculations with Casio fx-991 MS?,3
I hate SRK and don't want to see his face near that trophy again. SRH you better win tomorrow plz,3
How many do RR need to make to keep kkr run rate lower than rcb/dc?,2
Rr should now play 5 overs and make sure they destroy good run rate victory for kkr i mean go while taking out your enemy,3
Swanny betrayed RR,3
"Russell doesn't even bother bending, how fragile is he?",1
I think all people with NRR calculations are missing something. There is a chance of NRR increasing when you lose a close match depending on the amount of the runs scored in the match. MI dropped about 0.02 or so earlier in the tournament where they had a close win.,4
we need 2 superovers tomorrow and a reminder to SKY that he's not a part of the national team the day after please,9
MI bois please spare us on tuesday lmao,6
Wicket please!,3
"Death, Taxes and RCB fans and clenching butts before playoffs",10
Please RR bat the whole 20 overs..,8
"Even if RR loses by less than 75 runs, loser of RCB/DC can more likely compensate for the shortfall KKR requires to go through",5
"Wait, just looked at the scorecard, Rana got another golden duck? Lmao",5
I would say 30 more runs just to be on the safe side but 15+ would do,7
"KKR win by a big margin

Stay just below RCB and DC

RCB loses by a big margin to DC (Shikhar ton and a nice 50 by Stoini-boi, with RABADA and Nortje destroying RCB's lineup)

SRH win against Mumbai Indians.

Top 4:

MI

DC

SRH 

KKR",11
My boy Gopal out there for too long,3
Even Swann bailed out of RR ship,7
"Its been fun Tewatia. You really gave hope to a lot of people who'd given up with your knock vs KXIP. Hope that if you hang in there, things can change.  
  
Godspeed and we'll hopefully see you again in 6 months!",12
Looks like RR is playing for NRR,2
"If BCCI have yet another year of this T20 challenge instead of a full fledged IPL, you may as well assume that BCCI doesn't give a shit about women's cricket.",5

Get out already!,1
Only saw first 3 overs of first innings. Kkr was looking shaky. How did they make it to 190?,2
"8 runs, 3 wickets for KKR to go past DC.",3
"2 runs, 3 wkts :monkaS:",3
Looks like 2020 points table is gonna end up looking almost exactly like the 2019 points table. Only that CSK and RCB have switched places.,6
Are the players even aware of these numbers ? Or they just want to win it ? Surprised they aren‚Äôt going all out to get them before 111,7
"As a neutral, it'll be fun to watch RR's Twitter banter tonight. Gonna miss them this season NGL",12
DK with 110 catches: Yah say na,3
Jof truly deserves better,10
I wish I had studied maths with dedication like I strive to learn nrr out of my worthless time.,8
"All this drama only for the table going back to how it was in the first half of the season with MI, DC, RCB, and KKR or is SRH going to do something about this?",3
"What changes would you bring in for RR next season? I did kick out smith. Make buttler the captain. Get another overseas seamer because tye, oshane, curran are just average. Also then they wouldn't have to play aaron/unadkat/rajpoot. Get indian spinners for gopal and tewatia backup or maybe an overseas spinner.",3
"1 run, 3 wkts",3
"Whatever RR scores after 111 is the margin RCB / DC can lose by, tomorrow. Come on Rr.",13
So all that notes by baz came in handy today eh?,15

Varun Chakravarthy - He was  so far behind the long list of spinners waiting in queue to get into Indian team. From not even being in the radar to clinching a spot in Indian T20 squad.  Quite the story.,20
What a boring script for a Sunday night match,4

111 siuuuuu moral victory,6

Ah it's over.... Hopes crushed.,10
We winning this match Bois!!! Let's gooooooooooo,3
So who'd get MOTM? Cummins or Morgan?,2
KKR doesn't want to face MI in the top 2 lmao,3
"DC, whatever happens tomorrow, let's just agree to take it to the very last ball",14
Uffff finally 112 reached!. Now whatever runs scored are the margin that RCB can loose against DC.,9
All this drama and imagine if srh just wins against mi,7
Now frm here all the runs scored my RR are loss margin for DC or RCB,10
This is depressing,2

Thank you Archer for your contributions throughout the tournament,17
Just score a run a ball from now and reduce the chances of KKR making it to playoffs.,1
"With KKR set to win by a good margin, tomorrow's clash of DC vs RCB will have Ind vs SA in T20 World cup match type implications.. like there were various scenarios in that match. Winner and loser both could've gone to semifinals if loser scored a designated amount of runs.. And SA were top of the table before that match and went out of the tournament just because they couldn't reach the minimum total to go through to the semis.
Same scenarios are lined up to come in tomorrow's match.",5

Jofra happy he won't be playing any longer with this team atleast for next 6 months,12
GG lads,1
Aaron and Pan Parag were the 2 impostors,5
"Oh come on Varun, please hit a 6",2
Maha chutiya Aaron üò†,1
How convenient that Mumbai get to play their last few games in Dubai where the Qualifier and Final are? They are very sneaky like this but you will notice if you pay attention.,8
Fuck you Aaron atleast should've taken a single ffs,1

"CSK fans, despite not making it to the playoffs we celebrate tonight!",6
Varun Aaron 0(8) wtf were you trying to do ugh could've been 10 runs more,8
So do RCB need to lose by 20 runs for KKR to go through if SRH win? And DC even less?,9
Send Aaron to Australia next month. What a gemüòÅ,12
Alright math time how much can we lose by tmrw,8
Usually I'd sleep by now but I gotta see how Swann reacts to this,9
How much DC RCB need to lose by tmr to have lower NRR than KKR?,12

Even if we don't make it to the playoffs, this was a good finish to the season!


Edit: Fuck you serial downvoter!",31
If we crash out I blame this guy Varun Arun.,19
Wow only 2 runs in last over I atleast expected 6 didn't know Aaron can't even hold the bat,7
This would have been so much more fun if last team were to get relegated,7
MORAL VICTORY^(TM) FOR US,22
As exciting as watching water come to a boil.,7
Morgan showed how fearless cricket is better than timid cricket shown by Rahul,27
From the possibility of qualifying to last place... Such huge stakes in 3rd last game of league stage. Marvellous,10
"RCB/DC fans expecting Varun Aaron to hit 4s/6s?

*surprised pikachu face*",8
"Atleast csk fans can rejoice, no wooden spoon this year",8

Still.. Fuck CSK,-7

Aaron fucking over RCB even when he isn't in the team,17
I still don't get the point of taking a single. First ball off the over. Shreyas gopal the fuck man.,5
Jadhav got pissed he couldn't play any match and latched on to Varun Aaron instead,6
"Fuck yeah!!

We are not last. Thank you KKR and RR.",9
So what's KKR's NRR?,4
KKR going from 8th to 4th..... PARKOUR,21
We at number 4!! No wooden spoon in mouth!! Heck yeah!!!,2
[removed],4
Scotty rubbing at the end was lmao,0
[deleted],-1
"Stats guy, bring in the next chapter",1
A sincere thank you to RR for trying your best to keep us and DC both afloat,4
Double Superover happening tomorrow we have made the setting with DC,4
We deserve to be out if we lose tomorrow. So I am glad it worked out almost like that.,1
Fuck those nrr are sooo close,5
"The winning team of this match would reach top 4 (for now). The losing team would end up at the bottom. This would hold true no matter the result.

That's pretty insane.",4
"That Archer smile was all ""I can now go home!! Yippee!!""",9
"Legends, By how much run does dc/rcb has to lose by tommorrow to make kkr qualify?",2
"russel getting his timing back,cummins bang for the buck ,they just need to play the playoffs now.",3
Boyz some math please. Am a bit drunk to do it myself.,6
Moral victory to CSK for not ending up with wooden spoon.,7
"So for KKR , MI has to beat SRH right?",1
Atleast take it deep tomorrow you dumbfucks,6
"The most unpredictable team this year


Edit: Serial downvoter go fuck yourself.",6
"So if SRH loses to MI and one of RCB or DC fucks others shit up real bad it'll get really fucking intersting with RCB/DC not qualifying

Get your popcorns ready for tomorrow boys",8
Shreyas Gopal has been the gamechanger :(,4
What's the diff between RCB and KKR NRR now?,3
"-0.214 NRR, good chances for us",2
"kohli please fucking show up tomorrow, and chase if you win the toss.",4
So its official either rcb or DC should win by 15runs and kkr will stay at 4th,12
By how much should DC lose to get knocked off?,6
KKR at -0.21 now. Can anyone drop -0.06/-0.07 tomorrow?,5
Is cummins appology thread cumming btw,7
how much can RCB and DC afford to lose by tomorrow?,5
Math nerds where are you,9
All RCB and DC need to do is to fix the match tomorrow to finish on a tie or atleast a very close game. This will ensure both go through regardless of what happens in Super Over,-1
"Six words: fuck you, Steve Smith, Pat Cummins.",7
By how much DC/rCb can afford to lose tomorrow and stay ahead of kkr?,6
What if RCB and DC agree to a draw like in tests and just play super over? Big brain time!,6
Some KXIP/RR loser  is downvoting all comments,8
If RCB makes 170 and DC loses by 20 runs they will be out.,8
What is the loss margin for DC and RCB so that they go below KKR?,12
Is Juhi Chawla drunk?,5
Give us the numbers boys. How many runs and overs can we lose by.,17
Arron just wasted 8 precious balls.,8
"So, Thala's NRR game is actually to avoid wooden spoon instead of actual qualification. Noice",19
motm who?!,3
Can someone tell me by how many runs/balls can DC/RCB afford to lose to stay above KKR?,3
65 million years. Zap,18
Are there any real winners here? I think we've all lost after witnessing that.,7
srh loss now will bring this fuckery back to square one with mi rcb dc kkr qualifying,10
All four matches of weekend came opposite to what I wanted. Feeling old RCBian again,8
Guys nobody is getting knocked out tomorrow. Hyderabad has to beat mumbai otherwise all this speculation is for nothing,8
"Aah. It's over finally. It was wild season for us. Tewetia pulling Tewetia for the first time is one of the best matches that I have seen and I hope it kinda made Rahul dravid happy after that MI match. Watching archer taking wickets during beginning overs, seeing stokes score century at the end and ofcourse unadkat  was fun to watch . Especially from the season which wasn't gonna happen this year. I hope we have good bowling unit next year season tho. See you guys in next six months. Cheers :)",17
"Finally if srh loses their final game, this ipl would have the same 4 team qualify for playoffs which was in top since the end of second week lol , and this after having all the qualifications scenario",9

"so tomorrows match is a quarter final I suppose,and we know koachs record in knockouts. /s",10
Two shit undeserving teams are going to get second place tomorrow let alone a playoff place. Let that sink in,-2
Where are math dealers tell fast tell me the scenario how can we lose & still qualify,1
RR went from possible playoff contenders to wooden spoon in one match.,6
"Varun Aaron : form is temporary, class is permanent.",8
"SRH wants DC & RCB to take it to the final over, they don't want lockie furgerson in the play offs.",5
From chasing the total within 15 overs to book a playoff spot to finishing at the bottom. Quite a turnaround for RR,1
What are the calculations for the loser of RCB DC match to be out of top 4 for sure ?,2
So how much do SRH need to lose by to finish last?,4
All of us thought that Thala was playing for NRR to get into the playoffs. Little did we know it was to avoid the wooden spoon. 4D chess.,20
Shreyas Gopal might have saved the day for RCB and DC. But he was the one who brought KKR back into the game twice when they were in trouble. Busy day for him,10
"Rcb and dc fans in the first half: rcb vs dc finals bois

Rcb and dc fans in the second half: Varun Aaron please hit sixes broooo, please",39
"[Don't ask me what's happening tomorrow, I don't wanna spoil the fun ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jlmtpn/-/gasigx4)",9
So this time MI can indirectly fuck up KKR chances :/,6
"As a Mumbai Indians fan, I'm relieved that we are not going to face RR this season anymore.",13
Lose by Less than 20 runs tomorrow and KKR can't get to 3rd,1
 No setting with RCB. It‚Äôs top 2 or bust.,0
Guys just ease out some DC hate. It's just too much,2
RCB and DC may make a pact to make it a close one tomorrow,3
Calculators and engineers and all that shit but still no one is telling me tomorrow's affordable losing margin,6
"Unless SRH pulls off a miracle, the playoff positions are sealed",5
If CSK had just won one match they would be be in contention to sneak in the playoffs.,14
What is the loss margin for DC and RCB so that they go below KKR? (Both by winning runs and by overs to spare),10
how tf did RR end up last?,10
"If DC loses by around 20 runs , KKR will qualify irrespective of SRH match.",11

"I could understand this match being so lifeless had Kings XI won, but the stakes were soo much higher and we still got a borefest.",3
Thanks KKR I betted 10 coins for KKR and won 242 coins!!! Thanks a lot!!!!!!,17
Downvoters are still here.... upvote this cross ‚úùÔ∏è again to scare them away,14

CSK not last due to NRR. Thala playing the long game,39
Iyer let me down one more time lad with stupid captaincy or stupid batting. Why not both even.,9
How much do you have to hate your own life to come downvote everything,14
The downvoter is back,6
I can see RR go for one of STH's Indian bowlers next season.,5
Travel safe!!!,2
Both the games today have been disappointments.,10
"So...given this run rate, what are KKR's chances of qualifying?",8
"Lmao if mi wins vs srh, all will be for nothing, and we'll be back to the long time top 4. Very nice stuff",24
Paging the Probability Guy!,8
So Baz was doing NRR calculation on that book all this time,39
Why is everyone here taking SRH win against MI for granted? In all probability kkr will go through regardless of what happens in the DC/RCB match,7
The fact that we won comprehensively despite 3 ducks in the batting order shows our potential. This and the DC game showed our strength despite not all players performing.,5
"KKR will go through w/o SRH result 

If DC loses in 18 overs or by 20 runs",7
[deleted],-5
Who wouldve expected this outcome after 12-13 overs in first innings,6
So Csk not worst team this year. Thala's NRR game came to the rescue.,45
Fuck this shit rather watch PSL now. No way any other team than MI winning IPL next few years,-2

"KKR can now qualify for IPL 2020 by two methods:

‚Ä¢ Tomorrow DC/RCB defeats DC/RCB by:

‚Ä¢ DC loses by 14 or more runs/18.5 overs. 

‚Ä¢ If RCB loses then margin should be 17 or more runs/18.3 overs.

Kal DC aur RCB fans ki phatne wali hai.,18
see yall after 4 months.,2
"And congrats to MI , now they can grab the trophy",8
"Looking at Mavi/Nagarkoti, they have so much potential but they are no where near their peak in this tournament having come back from such a long layoff. With proper nurture and more play I could see them develop into really good bowlers. I dont know how KKR can retain both so there is a potential for other teams to look at signing one of them after next auction. 

Gill is another player who did not do enough considering his talent. He can look at how Padikkal or even Gaikwad late in the tournament applied themselves. Sometimes its not forcing shots but try to hit the ball in the sweet spot and pick gaps. I hope he continues to improve his game. He has ginormous potential and I cant see KKR not retain him. They could go for Morgan, Varun, Narine and look at Gill/Rana through RTM. Could be risky as these young kids will get big bidding. 

Russell needs to work on his fitness. Considering he is 32, I am not sure its worth keeping him. His fitness is not going to get better. But he is a hard player to replace. But this season was beyond mediocre. 

Eoin Morgan is class. I would definitely hold on to him. DK also did well in patches. I think he will find a good team(I hope its CSK) after next auction. 

&#x200B;

From RR perspective, its something similar to KXIP, when they were good they were really good. Stokes, Butler, Samson and of course Jofra Archer are excellent core. I am not sure they will keep Smith but he is not old and so I expect him to play for some team. Tewatia is really useful considering how well he bowls and his ability to tonk around. Gopal is also very useful. They probably need young Indian batsman or 2. I wish Smith had given longer rope to Yashaswi. That was a missed opportunity.",12
Man Russell smiling feels good.,17
"So the only 3 teams that can stop MI are out

Nice",19
">Russell: I watch on the phone what the bowlers do and the batters do

CSK insulted Raina by not giving him a balcony. KKR outdid them by not giving Russell a laptop/TV in his room.",23
No dead rubbers this year! How exciting!,16
Morgan such a cutie tbh,18
Cummins will rip india apart,11
"Phew, quite a buildup of tensions before this match and pretty eventful too. What a way to end the weekend",10
" **KKR** gifted this victory to **King Khan - Shah Rukh Khan**, on his birthday.",-4
"the test season 2 will have new script where they say ""sledge kohli this time around"".",12
"This is why Morgan should come up the order. Difference between getting to face 15-20 balls and 30+ balls. He is the best batsman in the side, can play anchor, can hit at strike rates comparable to Russell and has plenty of international experience. Should bat at 3 if possible.",34
"This ipl has been soooo good, not one team has looked bad throughout the season.",16
"Can we just give the trophy to MI at this point


With RR out",31
Is this what heartbreak feels like?,9
"**Tomorrow 2 teams out of 3 will get Q.**

1. Winner of DC vs RCB. Finish 2nd. Get 2 chances in playoffs.

2. Loser - if lost by small margin.

OR If lost by big margin KKR gets Q.

**That margin of loss is** around 20 runs or 12 balls to spare for DC.

For RCB's loss that margin is around 23 runs or 15 balls to spare.


Team which doesn't get Q will depend on SRH match.

**On Tuesday**- If SRH wins they are in playoffs with 4th Q.

If SRH loses RCB, DC, KKR all 3 qualify.",12
"would hate supporting any of these 4 in the playoffs. but I don't see any of rcb, dc or kkr beating MI also",12
Adani needs to enter into IPL else the trophy can be considered as Mumbai's for good every season hereby and IPL will be disbanded eventually,8
Tactical fix by RCB DC tomorrow? I'm all in. Lol,20
SRH will win day after and then reach the final. RCB and DC are way past their peaks. SRH has just hit theirs.,17
It is so typical IPL that a batting lineup which is stacked af and had scored big in recent games with all the momentum on their side suddenly gets steamrolled and run through by a bowler who has been out of form.,13
"A King Sized Victory for KKR and already so many haters are burning. There is nothing like this team deserved more, that team deserved more. This is a league; where the teams work hard for 14 matches for the top 4 spot. If your team deserved more, they would have been in Top 4. Haters keep barking.",15

"Curious Case of Lockie Ferguson. He was the hero for KKR, a few weeks ago and was hugely hyped. But his last three games didn't work as expected, and his match vs CSK was awful. Eventually, he was dropped from the match against RR. *This shows, life can be extremely cruel to you and it is really a matter of survival of the fittest.*",17
"Nitish Rana last 5 matches: Golden Duck, Eighties, Golden Duck, Eighties, Golden Duck.

If FC Barcelona & Kolkata Knight riders play on the same day; if FCB wins - KKR loses, and if KKR wins - FCB loses.

* 21st October - Barcelona beat Ferencv√°rosi 5-1, and KKR lost to RCB by 8 wickets
* 24th October - KKR beats DC by 59 runs, and Barcelona lost El Clasico to Real Madrid 1-3
* 29th October - Barcelona beat Juventus 2-0, and KKR lost to CSK by 6 wickets
* 1st November - Barcelona drew with Alaves 1-1 (equivalent to defeat), and KKR beat RR by 60 runs.",22
I'm surprised nobody's talking about the fact that Swanny has now picked KKR as the team he's supporting now that KXIP has been knocked out.,11
