Don't know who'll win this,0

Fantasy guesses???,0
No kane no party,6
Hopefully we have a close match after the last few one sided matches,4
Will be supporting whoever fields first today,4
"SRH should just go all in with their top order by adding Kane at 3 or 4. Whatever balance they’re trying for isn’t working so might as well make your strength even stronger with a world class top order. 

If Kane is in form he can help guide the middle order by letting them play around him rather than collapsing. 

Also maybe look at getting Khaleel back in, did great last year.",8
"KKR should play Tripathi in place of Naik and make him open with Gill.
Tripathi, Gill, Rana, Morgan, Russell, DK should be the batting order",4
Ayy Game day! But boys we seriously need Kanos in the side.,5
Hope Banton’s playing today,2
"Offtopic, but why does the bot have an RCB flair?",-1
Peter Handscomb for the win,3
Sunrisers were pretty unlucky during the last match.hope they win this time,2
Holder / Nabi comes in place of Mitch Marsh,1
I hope this is a good game after a really strong start with the first few the last 4 have been naff.,3
I feel that the fate of this match will be completely decided by the the performance of the SRH top order.,6
Get in! Where my *Reverse Jinx™* bois at?,1
Are KKR one of the favourites?,1
Say all shit you want to say here. But the match will be decided on who bats first.,3

"As an Australian, this is the most difficult weekend to find a team to support. It is basically Cummins (KKR) vs Warner (SRH) today and Maxi (KXIP) vs Smudge (RR) tomorrow",12
"Gavaskar controversy is dominating my news feed and I have to say, I feel for the little master.

I have been annoyed by his cliches, but by maliciously manipulating of his words, these media people have shown their true colors. I'd listen to him rather than these liars on TV/Twitter.",47
"Hello, I am here for disappointment.

Kidding aside, I hope Tripathi plays instead of Naik and opens.",6
"It’s getting super frustrating with Manish Pandey. 2 years and he has not really won us a single game. The few times he’s done well we’ve actually lost. He’s 31 years old and his India spot is hanging by a thread. Enough of his “supporting role” of just giving strike to the other batsman. If players like SKY and Rana can play both the aggressor and supporting role and are younger than him, the selectors shouldn’t hesitate to treat Pandey like Rayudu and just forget about him.",2
[removed],8
Is Williamson injured?,2
"DK is just not captain material, they literally have the best white ball captain in the world rn",5
"I hope Nabi plays, not for selfish reasons but because SRH have a ridiculous record when both Rashid and Nabi play.",6
"Pls stop playing all of Warner's tiktoks

Please",1
"I actually dreamed about this match last night and in that dream, Kuldeep gets Warner out with an absolute peach, “ball of the century” type stuff that completely foxes him and crashes into the stumps. Let’s see if that happens.",0
"No one:

r/cricket aNalYsTs: Make the player ""who did not really cement his place in the team"" captain",4
I have a question. Why are the match threads never pinned?,5
Hopefully SRH play Nabi Saha and Khaleel.,3
I think Williamson in place of Marsh and Nabi in place of Rashid and Nadeem as front line spinner should be the way to go for SRH. I know dropping Rashid seems rude but to balance the middle order and spin department Nadeem can fill in Rashid's place,-1
[Obligatory NSFW Warner](https://i.imgur.com/rMFdtQl.jpg),9
Anyone know how to watch from 3pm on sky sports? They are showing the English women's until 4pm,3
[deleted],3
Does bairstow always play as opener for England in T20s or did he play at other positions too? Genuinely don't know and looking for an answer.,2
I just realized SRH are missing Shakib. He is an essential component in the team even if he has an average season.,0
Any team changes expected for KKR?,1
Warner playing against us in IPL 2017 scored 129 from 59 balls... still gives me PTSD.,10
Hopefully Nabi plays if Kane is still injured. I feel that would be a better combo than trying Holder or extra pace bowler.,1
Is Nikhil Naik a big hitter? What purpose does he serve in the team? I watched him open too and he struggled both times,0
"If Nikil naik plays today as well i dont mind us losing. 
Kkr management shud learn their lesson.",2
I can still remember being nervous about vs KKR matches when gambhir was leading it. Now it's no fun :/,4
Finally someone is batting first after winning the toss!,7
Damn 3 changes for SRH,3
Finally we can witness Nagarkoti,2
"win toss and bat first, SRH finally breaking the streak.",6
RIP 3D.,3
Who comes in for Sandeep?,3
Nagarkoti in the house. First time seeing Mavi - Nagarkoti pair after world cup. Let's goooooo,4
Ahhhh the best changes they could've made,3
"Yup, bat first is definitely best for us. We’re simply much better at defending than chasing. If they win the toss SRH should bat first against all teams but chase against CSK.",6
"Just a year back Shankar was playing for India in freaking WC and now he can't make even the SRH side. I never understand how many players like Dube, Sundar, Shankar, Khaleel get to play for India but doesn't play consistently in IPL",0
Who is this nagargoti?,-3
No Kane :-(,6
[removed],9
Mandatory game for Varun Chakravarthy before he is dropped next match,4
8 bowling options for KKR.,3
Get narine from first over itself.,-1
Congratulations to Nagarkoti for his IPL debut.,6
But have they paid respects to deno yet?,-7
[deleted],1
"Khaleel actually is our fastest Indian bowler. He crossed 140 several times last season. It’s extremely rare for Bhuvi, Kaul or Thampi to cross 140 and Sandeep has never done it.",3
"Batting first is the best option, we excel at defending especially low targets.",2
Shankar isn’t playing... my fantasy team is so fucked. I am too paranoid to wait until the toss to make my selections because I am worried I will over-sleep. But this hurts. Luckily I didn’t make him my captain,3
Khaleel isn't shown in the playing XI sheet?,2
Nagarkoti hype lets goooooo,5
"Lets go guys

This teams looks much better than 1st game atleast on paper.",4
JP duminy is a commentator now?,3
Phone call celebrations are back baby!!!,2
Get JP Duminy in the Dugout !,2
"Wait! Didn't Warner say Sandeep out for khaleel, why are they still showing Sandeep?",10
"2019 World Cup: *Shankar out of WC after he 'injures' his toe catching a Bumrah toe crusher in nets*  
  
IPL 2020: *Shankar out after tweaking back*  
  
Wonder which one of the lads did it this time lmao",7
"Nagarkoti is better than McGrath, Ambrose, and Wasim combined, I heard.",8
Good on SRH for not immediately dropping Garg. I think he deserves a few more chances. He didn’t become the U19 captain for nothing.,8
"No freaking clue why we're playing an extra bowler, especially considering how rusty both Russell and Morgan looked last match. Might really end up backfiring if we let them score 160+",6
"We have 3 players from the U19 WC winning squad today .

Nagarkoti hype train, let's  gooo.",4
danny morisson and his double Ds are back. this day has already had a bad start.,1
Unpopular opinion : Danny Morrison is cringe,3
Is this nagarkotis first competitive game since 2018?,1
"So hyped for Nagarkoti, waited far too long to see him bowl.

Just hope he has a decent debut, don't want anything extraordinary, just decent will do fine.",3
"If Cummins can't get YBJ or Warner in the first 6 overs, it's game over",2
It will be interesting to see how Cummins goes at 7. He hasn’t often had the opportunity to play as an allrounder.,2
Anyone know what channel this is on Sky? Can only find women's t20 currently,1
Are they not showing it in the UK until 4 or am I missing something? Not even on sky mix,2
I like this stamina meter thing,3
"Btw, DK said that Nagrkoti is the best fielder in India along with Jadeja. So, watch out for his fielding too.",3
Cricinfo down?,1
"Over the last two years, Nagarkoti has become this fabled mythical creature that bowls 150kph, that I'm afraid with little to no competitive cricket in the last two years he might struggle and fickle fans will will start shitting on him instantly.

Hoping his class shines through today.",3
"The only man stopping us from victory is David tiktok warner. 

That guy has insane record against us folks.",5
"Anyway Bairstow, Warner, Morgan, Russell 

Dingers will be hit",5
"why the fuck are Sky showing the Women’s T20 on 3 different channels and not the IPL from the start

I want to watch the worlds greatest batsmen opening in 10 minutes ffs",14
"UK people, can someone tell me which channel it’s on? SkySports seems like it’ll only show it at 4PM, because women’s cricket is more important apparently.",7
Sometimes I wish we could just loan our U19 players to other national teams. It unfortunately doesn't work like football lol,1
PRESS RED BUTTON ON SKY SPORTS CRICKET UK VIEWERS,8
Backing DK to play a match winning innings tonight.,2
"most fast bowlers from u19 tournaments don't have much success at the senior level, especially Indian ones.

I don't think Nagakoti will be any different",-1
Wanted to support SRH because of Kanos but no New Zealand player yet apart from Neesh and Boult?,3
Lara in the Dugout!,2
"Finally someone choses to bat first,

So KKR to chase down easily?",3
Difference between star sports select 1 and 2?? 2 costs just 1/3rd of select 1 why?,1
So hyped to see Kamlesh and Mavi back together,2
They chose batting....is it first this ipl ?,3
"I am scared, we will be on the bottom of the table after today's match

Hope we atleast our bowlers stay away from Russell's onslaught",0
will cummins open the bowling? or mavi and nagarkotti this game?,1
"Kkr has done one thing right by dropping nikhil naik

Now i just want them to open the bowling with Pat Cummins

They should give their premiere fast bowler the best chance to pick wickets esp with that top heavy batting of srh",3
dk is just so nice. i hope he has a good game.,4
Wow RCB has the worst NRR in the tournament -2.18,1
"Shankar dropped for Saha, don't they use shankar for bowling too ?

Williamson still not fit it seems",5
"No Kane.

This is day dreaming but if csk get Kane it'd be great at least in next ipl",3
I remember an interesting interview of Ganguly in which he said that he rated Mavi more than Nagarkoti as the former bowls heavy balls while the latter is more of a skiddy pacer.,2
"I like KKR's bowling options, but their batting line-up seems very thin",1
Gill is overrated. Fight me,2
No Kane again? :(,3
"Two flawed yet fairly evenly matched teams coming off defeats. Yep, should be a cracker.",2
"One thing i believe kkr is lacking is a proper character people can get behind(I don't know if it makes sense). Every team has one that fans would follow or attract their attention. Risabh, Dhawan for DC, Kohli AB for RCB, Dhoni for CSK, Stokes or Smith for RR, Rohit Pandya Bumrah for MI, Bhuvi Warner for SRH. KKR has nobody after Gauti's departure. Are they short of good player? Hell No. They can win all games if they want. But they just lack that character person. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

Edit: I would like to add that Russell's a great player, probably the best in the tournament. But nobody relates to him. He doesn't have the charisma off field like the others mentioned.",1
6 proper bowling options. Wow. When was the last time that happened?,1
Is Saha opening should I change my team?,3
I want to see Mavi and Nagarkoti open the bowling.,2
"Speaking of shit-posting: 

Assuming both bowl their quick deliveries, what would be the speed of the ball when Nagakoti bowls a Mavi who bowl the Kookaburra?",1
KKR have a long tail,2
"If you are new to match threads, feel free to use these templates for profit. Replace `$player` with player of your choice.

1. Man, `$player` is looking thicc (meaning - he has round butt and I can't stop looking at it).
2. `$player` has become so fat, wonder why they keep playing him (meaning - visual fitness > match readiness and stats).
3. I can't believe `$player` has dropped a difficult catch, drop him.
4. I can't believe `$player` has dropped a difficult catch, you cannot convince me this isn't fixed.
5. If out of options, comment on score symmetry. Ex: Batsman1 6(4) Batsman2 6(4). This sells and resells well. 
6. When you see 69 on screen, point it out with or without a witty comment for quick burst upvotes
7. When you see a lame attempt at fielding, say I P L F I E L D I N G.
8. When you see a common shitty umpiring decision that makes you pull out your hair, say **I P L U M P I R I N G**. Umpires will actually help you out on this.
9. `$player` has scored 150SR 3/5/N years back, why is he taking singles on a difficult pitch in unfamiliar/humid conditions?
10. Point out ass kissing attempts of commentators for quite a profit.
11. Say something equivalent of OK Boomer to Gavaskar and how old and out of touch he is~ haha, quite funny.
12. Talk at length about how Kohli isn't a good captain even if you don't know what you are talking about.
12. Talk at length about how Kohli isn't a good captain even if you know what you are talking about.
13. NRR, am I right. Sprinkle it here and there when team is slowing down.

I will try to come up with more. Please feel free to use these as you like.",20
I like this bowling unit a lot. The batting unit on the other hand.. Meh.. Given up on it already.,1
Astro Cricket be trolling!! Iykyk.,1
"Did Harsha just call Cummins a ""modern great"" ? 😂 LMAO that's a stretch",-3
"Too all the people sad about no Kane, how would u fit him in the team, just curious btw",1
"With the inclusion of Nabi and Saha, the middle order doesn't look so bad",3
"Man, Russel is looking thicc (meaning - he has round butt and I can't stop looking at it).",5
Anyone know why the first hour isnt on sky,2
I think they should have let Saha open and put Bairstow at 3 or 4 to strengthen the middle order. Give Saha a pinch hitting role,2
I'm so happy for Nagarkoti,2
"Nagarkoti and Mavi together for KKR! 
 
hopefully this combo plays for India too",2
[deleted],0
Did Warner.exe just glitch?,2
Why is the women’s game on Sky Sports Cricket *and* Sky Sports Mix until 4? Is there any way to watch the IPL on the SkyGo app until then? I don’t think you can red button on here...,3
"2 runs, too bad there is long off",1
Brian Lara in the dugout!,2
Just have a strong intuition that cummins will redeem himslef today n prove why he was paid so much,1
Ok so why did srh replace marsh with Jason holder a BOWLING all-rounder when clearly they lack the depth in BATTING....,2
What ever fuck you  don't play like us in yesterday.,1
Chowka nahin chahiye lol,1
Lol Warner wanted to switch hit first ball....he is in good space of mind.,2
Is this the only tournament we're likely to see Cummins v warner?,1
Weird hearing DK talk in Hindi,1
"My god, kkr has very good bowling.",4
Cummins is the perfect mentor for Mavi and Nagarkoti since he had injury problems early in his career too.,5
the stump mics are picking up everything.,5
Absolute bollocks running,3
Bhaag  ~~puji~~ Jhonny bc,4
Please please please see out Narine,4
"We guessing among nagarkoti, mavi n Cummins. 

Dk playing 6d chess n opening with narine.",5
"The speed at which Warner, Kohli and Dhoni run is of the next level.",5
"I have sky on a now tv subscription, does anyonr know how I can watch this?",7
Warner and bairstow batting as openers is kind of OP,6
Nagarkoti playing after almost 2 years or so,4
Is anyone better between the wickets than Warner?,3

"Sky sports showing the women's T20I on both mix and cricket

1 channel for each, cmon lads",11
"OMG Karthik stop, it's been 5 mins",3
Dk speaking hindi with 2 foreign batsman in crease lol,19
"Who would keep, Saha or Bairstow",1
8 bowling options for KKR lol.,5
Both these teams have a long tail,3
Ditch Sky and be an Inscect Enthusiast,1
Wonder how fast Nagarkoti bowls now.,1
How many players have the capacity to open both the bowling and the batting this IPL? Narine is something else.,2
Why the fuck aren’t sky showing the game,5
What happened to the sponsorship on Bairstow's bat?,2
Love the stump mic output,3
Damn Brian Lara has such a sweet voice,3
Makes sense try cummins and narine to put pressure in pp.,2
No wonder DK has a pathetic over rate,3
DK's Hindi is really good tbf.,6
"With all the running and talking and field placements DK does....I am surprised he never got penalized for slow over rate. 

Lol even he bats, he follows a routine.",7
Now we play the annual game of “what bat sponsor will Bairstow use this year”,6
Narine opening bowling and batting,5
Ya patty opening,4
Bairstow currently without a bat sponsor...enter Pan Bahar.,7
Cum daddy vs Warner battle of the oz,3
is this nagarkoti's first ipl match.,1
C'mon Davey bring that big dick energy,6
I hoped they filled enough Diesel in the Cummins engine today,3
"Any UK Sky watchers, this game is on the red button.",16
"I thought this is first season for Cummins in IPL. Dude already 18 games Lol.

 Which team did he play previously?!",5
I want Cummins to do well but SRH win,24
The understanding between Bairstow and Warner is always orgasmic,16
Warner/Bairstow is the IPL equivalent of Baz/Lynn?,3
Hoping from a better performance from cum daddy,5
Choose to bat.... rEgREt,0
DK's beard is 👌,3
What are those numbers? YJB is such a beast in white ball cricket,2
Let's see if cummo has a better day than last time he played,3
I have a feeling that whoever looses this match will end up at the bottom of the table by the end of the season and the other will slog their way to playoffs,4
I knew that Bairstow had one monster year in tests but never realized he has played 70 test matches. Some transformation he underwent,3
[removed],41
Surely Cumsock won't have two bad games in a row.,6
Is Kane still injured? The batting depth seems to be questionable.,4
Why does Pat Cummins always look like he's just a little uncomfortable.,2
Fuck me. Patty is one handsome man.,10
Is Saha keeping today?,1
Imagine paying to get sky on your laptop at uni and then not being able to watch the IPL because Sky (despite having paid for the rights) have chosen to show the women’s match instead....,6
Is the pitch really slow ?,5
Now this is more like CumDog,15
Cummins should be bowling two overs in the powerplay always. It's a bit of a no-brainer really.,15
Bairstow and Warner have amazing synergy. They take singles and doubles when no other paid would even dream of taking.,8
These two will probably steal an extra 15-20 runs just by running these fast singles or doubles.,6
Amir Dummy,4
That was Cummins in full glory,5
So that CEAT ad is nightmare fuel.,4
Bring back IPL on ITV with Shonali,2
"That's more like it.

Now pick a wicket in next over.",2
DK takes too long to set field,1
"This is what one might consider a 15.5 Cr player  , if Patty continues bowling like that",1
David Warner has scored at a rate of 188.37 against Sunil Narine since 2017 in IPL without being dismissed. (Runs 81 from 43 balls),3
Why is Lockie Ferguson not playing?,2
"However pretty he looks when he smiles , I like serious Cummins bowling.",3
Bhai kitni baar bolega single gaya toh theek hai,1
What's the point of a batting line up where your best players have to abandon their natural game and try to be apprehensive! Sad state..,0
the stadium dj still living in 2005 time capsule.,2
"If my math isn’t wrong then each group stage delivery Cumdog bowls is worth $9,404 USD",4
Warner and Bairstow are going to try and run a 2 off a leave one of these days,8
Happy to see Dk playing the role of rishab pant today,3
Yessssss go Daddy,4
Cummo back in form.,1
"Cardekho ad so good, I downloaded the app twice!!",1
Nice shot Warner.,1
I'm excited to see the nearly-mythical creature that is Varun Chakravarthy bowl at some point.,5
"Cummins From travelling to all parts of the park last game to batsman not even clearing 30 yard circle in his first over today

What a turnaround",2
That's what we'd like to see.,1
Sky aren’t televising this live at the moment ?,1
A wicket now will probably be the most important wicket the whole time. Warner and bairstow can run their way to victory if they want to,1
"Wait did DK not get fined for a slow over rate last game?

They took 2 hours and 6 minutes

Extremely bad over rate",5
"""lovely, lovely, lovelyyy, loveleeey, LOVELYYYY""

dk on song.",6
We were lucky to get Warner run out weren't we,4
Wow they chucked vijay shankar out 😂,2
DK is really fucking up the over rate with all of these field changes,6
What's with Bairstow's bat?,1
lovely lovely lovely lovely lovely,1
"If kkr manage to get these two, prior the 10th over I think its pretty much game over for srh",1
Kane Williamson please..,1
Wtf is an unacademy cracking six,8
How will Jonny get warner out today,3
"SRH IPL theme is easily the worst. It is just ""Go Go Go"". What a fall from Deccan Chargers",5
"I do not know about others, but I am enjoying lack of loud fake noise.

Nice to listen to stump mic , commentators and background noise.",4
How come the batsman hit a boundary? Piss poor captaincy! Sack DK! Make the world cup winning captain the captain for this team!,1
Just wanna see Kamlesh rip some stumps out of the ground,3
Niceee Warner with his game,3
Did DK just say lovely BATTING?!,4
Has anyone ever seen Narine smiling even once? Asking for a friend.,2
Is YJB not sponsored,6
We are going easy on KKR by going one less dimension than we normally do.,4
Warner probably has one of the best records against Narine in IPL history.,3
"Cummo baby pick it pick

Lele 1 2 wicket wicket",2
Who was that lady shown when Warner hit six?,2
"Bruh Scotty nailed the Hindi translation, wtf",4
"Good over, want Warner be there untill 14 overs.
I don't trust 3D or any other cunts in the middle order",3
No one should ~~criticise~~ troll Nagarkoti even if he plays bad today. He hasn't played quality cricket for almost 2.5 years now.,1
Just noticed HotStar has noticed the rewind button.,1
Scott Styris is such a gem of a cricketer.,4
Warner garu sirrr Warner ante Warner,3
I'm doing live commentary in English. Any kind of support is welcome 🙏 https://youtu.be/w4ABmaiyWHE,6
"Srh removed 3d vijay, csk just need to follow and remove their vijay now",4
"No don't go run risk runs, I won't be able to take early wicket",2
"need cummins to pick up a wicket to make this interesting. come on, patty!",1
"Imagine being on the fan wall and casually being spoken to by Scott Styris and Brian Lara

Lucky af",2
Finally Cummins bowling where he should have,3
Starting with Narine against Warner was probably not a good idea.,1
"If SRH are allowed to let Bairstow and Warner bat twice on the condition that the rest of the batting order be eliminated, they'd score more than they do now",4
Damn the noise...,2
I can cum on Cummins today,8
Cummo bowling like cummo today,7
Omg what was that.....lovely as fuck,3
"Warner has edge over Narine

I believe someone else will come in his place now",2
Warner is crazy lucky there,2
Why is [Chris Green](https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/787073.html) not in the team?,0
That's nice. Cramping Warner for room. Warner isn't someone who can generate room for himself spontaneously.,2
Imagine being the poor sod that has to bowl against the wind,3
Cummings looking shard today.,1
Cummo cutting warner into half,1
SRH play like 5 down when Warner and Bairstow are out lol,3
"If you stack two David Warners on top of each other, they still won't be taller than Cummins.",5
Is there a way to enable auto refresh on browser?,3
Bairstow is still the most successful player against Warner,4
Warner is clearly looking to make the most of his batting stint today...,3
Cummins trying the Broad tactics against Warner - trying to create an angle from round the wicket to cramp him up .,3
Orange kinda sus,1
The wind in my back...lol thats me after one too many shawarmas,2
Cummo breathing fire,3
Today is one day we need these guys to bat deep.,1
This is perfect bowling from Cummins.,1

Review? Why?,1

Warner averages 79 and has a SR of 165 against Narine in IPL,5
This is why he is a millionaire. What fantastic bowling,2
Shit Not out,5
No bat involved lol,2
"Bit annoying this isn't on Sky Sports Mix on Now TV, bit daft to have the womens T20 on both. SAD",2
Lol bad decision by ump,2
Fuck man..Cummings is so unlucky.,2
Booo,2
"Srh fan 

Uhohuohuhoh",2
Oh thank god,4
Lmao did they just show Umesh as an example of where to bowl to Bairstow,3
What is this 5d chess,2

Top comeback from Cummins so far. Champion bowler.,14
Cummins finally bowling properly,9
CumDog terrorised him and he got him. What a spell so far,13
Cummins redemption arc in IPL very sharp,33
"Cummins appears to have made the effort to bowl fuller today, hitting the top of off and it's worked",9
"**3.6** Cummins to Bairstow, OUT, **bowled him next ball!**  Looks like an offcutter. Bairstow swishing all over this . **24-1**

JM Bairstow  b Cummins 5 (10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00",4
Six and a half metres,6
Fantastic delivery!!!,3
Cummins earning his paycheck,9
[deleted],91
"Cummins is love, Cummins is life.",8
Tail starts.,12
Is Sky just not playing this?,4
Bairstow played well last match and Cummins bowled hot trash. How the turntables,15
"Lmao. Successful review, and then immediately gets bowled.

Hilarious.",9
Cummins with this perfect line and length. Looked absolutely on point this over.,28
The one time I make someone who’s not Warner my captain for Fantasy he gets out for under 10. Lmao,3
Warner's wicket and SRH tail begins,3
Pat cummins looks like a taller version of Tom cruise .,9
"Feels like last match was just us playing against MI , can't help ourselves",5
Didn't know I was watching The Ashes,3
That gap between bat and ball was....as wide as my ex gf,5
INTO THE TAIL NOW BOIS,7
Bairstow getting Ashes 19 PTSD,8
Bowled through the gates.... as always :(,9
Those 15cr jokes didn't age well,42
Patty Cummins ..... you can't keep class hidded for a long time. What an opening spell,7
Top of off stump always goes on a chef's kiss delivery,7
Bowled Bairstow at it again.,2
[deleted],10
Classic Johnny Bowledstow that,7
This is class from Cummins.,2
Just had to see that one ball out 😔. This would've been the end of narine and Cummins for a while,3
YJB and getting bowled. Name a more iconic duo.,3
This is top kek,5
"Damn, that was a good ball.",5
Cummo!,9
Cummins justifying that 15 Cr price.,11
Cummins has paid 1 crore back with that wicket,6
YJB changing bat sponsor again?,6
"It’s fine guys if bairstow almost got us to a win next time. Warner can definetly get us to them this time 

Right?

sighs",2
KKR into the tail /s,6
"Pat Cummins absolutely outstanding so far today. He had a tough  previous game, but his class is permanent.",3
The first ball from Cummins really rattled bairstow,2
Okay i got my content for the night 💦,10
Lol now the shit batting order gets exposed 😁,7
It's funny how many people had already written off Cumdaddy after only 1 bad match.,31
"Never been more happy with an Aussie bowling an English out

Myself being a England fan",12
Money can't buy me love. But they can buy you wickets!,10
LOL. We could now temper down our expectations a bit and just enjoy the show.,5
So SRH are 4 down,2
Always believed in ma boi,6
Patty Cummins is a fingertip away from perfection,11
cUmMiNs Is A bAD BuY,1
Bairstow was seeing a red ball.,3
Amazing over,2
LoCkIe fErGuSOn > pAT cUmMIns in t20,2
"Well unless Manish Pandey plays as well as he did in the last few games last season, we're fucked",1
"Bairstow and getting bowled.

Name a more iconic duo",5
"Remember people saying Cummins isn't a quality t20 bowler and stuff like that when he was getting thrashed in the previous match. This is his class. 

No offence to anyone.",6
Can someone explain to me how YJB keeps getting bowled. Is it a flaw in his technique?,1
YJBs wicket will bring the score down from 200 to 140,7
"Looks: Check
Skills: Check
Height: Check 
Pat can Cummin me. No homo",7
Bhai ne last game ego pe le liya,9
"Remember the time, when Narine was literally unplayable ?",9
Manish Pandey dot ball masterclass incoming.,4
"As much as I’m a fan of the Women’s cricket getting the broadcasting weight it deserves, it’s a bit of a piss take that Sky have it on two channels at the moment and have no room for the IPL game. Didn’t even get to see Jonny bat ffs",10
"MY GOODNESS, CUMMO",2
All those who were making jokes about how KKR wasted money on Pat.. How you doing fellas,5
[Exclusive press shot of Danny Morrison live from the comms box](https://st2.depositphotos.com/5982356/9400/i/950/depositphotos_94009086-stock-photo-funny-bald-man.jpg),1
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Cummins. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Cummins. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",11
Arguably the best opening batting duo an ipl bowler can bowl at and Cummins makes such a comeback statement! Take that critics!!😎,5
"Come on, Fraud. At least score in multiples of that 11Crs you gobbled up. 11,22,33,44.. We'd be happy with anything.",-6
"Indian bros – why is Pandey listed in the on-screen scorecard as M Pandey and not just Pandey, similar to the way Warner is?",4
Now all KKR needs to do is get Warner out and fast forward to a victory.,39
You reckon sky will actually put it on at 4pm or will they just put it on when England v West Indies is done?,5
Can we bring Broad for one match?,5
"Cummins last over was test cricket level perfection, you could have seen pressure was on Bairstow from 1st ball",7
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Cummins.

Pandey is a KKR spy in SRH,2
why are folks underestimating pandey?,1
Hope to see [Ali Khan](https://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/player/927119.html) soon,1
Omg Karthik tried to hug Cummins after that wicket but Cummins wasn't having any of it lol. My man DK getting dissed,10
Get ready for Pandey's test audition,4
[deleted],3
Wow look at these ungrateful fucks calling Pandey a fraud!,10
"Bc I was in no 1 position untill Jhonny was in the crease, now fell to 50k",5
Rohit-esque.,10
What a shot Manish,4
What a shot goddamn,4
Manish Anna...,2
One of these days common sense will be a technology available to the third umpire.,1
Pandey gaaaru,4
That was nonchalant from Pandey. Ooof.,2
"**Pat Cummins to Jonny Bairstow in all T20s (including  today)**

Balls 11 

Runs 6

Wickets 2",2
Manish Pandey had enough of tuk tuk cricket.,1
Nice stroke..,1
Why are everyone bashing Pandey here. He is the last recognized batsman and only maybe Nabi can bat after him. He has to be a bit careful.,4
Finally Nagarkoti plays for us,6
Just don’t bowl on a short length if it’s not a bouncer. Not hard to understand,6
That's not how you play test innings Pandey,7
M'Pandey *tips hat*,4
"Picked it so early, good confident shot",4
"I feel KKR shud continue with Cummo for one more over

He is bowling beautifully

U get Warner out here n u win the game",7
"Wow!!

That was something else.",2
Up ka rohit sharma,3
Pandey: /r/cricket talk nah!,5
Guys that was a reverse jinx. See it worked,4
"Pandey is going to fuck these u19s, what's the consent age in India",6
The big screen just went in inception mode,8
"Glazing over KKR batting lineup, it doesn't seem to be that threatening either except for the obvious couple.",2
Manish Pandey is the type of batsman to hit a six and then play out 5 dot balls.,7
Still can't get over United's finish 😂. Cummo bowling well today though,1
Em crowd ra ayya,9
Manish Pandey was the first Indian to score a IPL century.,7
"**Bowlers to bowled out Bairstow in IPL**

Piyush Chawla

Yuzvendra Chahal

Pat Cummins",7
Loud cheer for that crappy single.,20
Bring in cummin,1
Kkr should finish cummins quota. Man is determined to reverse his ipl show.,3
"So what I've understood, 

The DJs at Abu Dhabi are SO off their timing to cue the crowd noises. Was the case in the opener, MI vs KKR and now here..",1
Why is DK's dream11  ad dubbed?,1
Hope to see [Manimaran Siddharth](https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/1151286.html) soon,-2
Good call to continue with Cummins. He is not a good death bowler.,1
*Warner gets a single and the crowd goes wild*,0
Who will bowl in death?,1
Bold decision from DK to keep Cummins on,2
Warner seems to have had a little Ptsd with that last runout,3
Which side of the bed did Cummins wake up today? He is breathing fire.,3
"Just a small touch from the audio which I only noticed today. The audio matches the ""home team advantage"", I think. So KKR is the ""home team"" and you could hear the disappointment in the DRS call etc. The ""KKR KKR"" chant etc.",7
Fend this over boys. We can do this,1
Jeez. SRH middle order looks fragile.,1
"Tried red button on sky, came up with golf and now the red button won't do anything",3
"Can anyone explain Bairstow's wicket ? My observation is - 

Seam was pointing towards the slip..yet the ball came back after pitching on the surface. I think Bairstow was also expecting it to hold its line or move a little away. He was playing for an outswinger.

How do you prepare for such type of deliveries as a batsman ? Seam pointing outwards yet the ball coming back in or vice versa

Feel free to correct my observation.",6
Backing Cummins to finish with <10 runs conceded.,1
Not sure if it is Cummins or Broad bowling to Warner,2
Smart captaincy from DK. No point in saving the best bowlers for the death overs because SRH don't have batsmen who can score then.,43
Holy shit Saha strikes at 131?,5
"Nice gamble.

If Cummins get Warner, the game is won.",7
"How is it not illegal to bowl a Test bowling spell in a T20 league match, what the fuck Cummins",6
Kkr effectively has 7 bowlers today..,1
Does anyone know why Kane Williamson is not playing?,1
Wtf they're playing crowd cheers for Manish taking a single?! Is that the bar now? Him scoring 1 run?,-5
"SRH batting lineup looks weak. Get Warner, game over.",1
Get ur aussie homie out cummo,3
Slapped.,3
Isn't there a constant ring on dugout hotstar?,1
Aussie loves short balls,2
A real crowd never goes this wild for a fucking single,4
God my heart is slipping into my ass with every delivery of cummy,7
This match is so boring that this thread is not trending today,5
Isn't there a constant ring on dugout hotstar?,1
Omg. Shut the fake audience off. My ears are bleeding.,0
"Being from Sydney Warner & Cummins would rarely play against each other, it's interesting to see how they handle each other",9
Has Nagarkoti bowled yet?,2
"That's the shot, taking him . Well controlled shot David bhai.",4
Law of averages,0
Come on you 2. Give us a good match for the weekend instead of the snooze fests last few games.,3
"Mccullum be like "" upsc ke liye likh leta hoon ye "" .",13
"Interesting bowling strategy, Cummo going wider and bowling into Warner.",6
Why’s everyone talking shit about Manish? Didn’t he score 350 runs last year?,7
This is the first time Pat Cummins has ever bowled to David Warner in a professional match.,58
Why is everyone shutting on Manish? Didn’t he score 300+ at 42 last year?,3
Wait. Fake crowd nosies in dugout too? Fucking Donkeys,5
Cummins 1-11 haha,3
Classic opening spell from Cummins.,4
F for people who removed Cummins from their fantasy team after his last performance,42
11 runs from 3 overs for CumDog in the powerplay. That's a big turnaround compared to the last game. Remember when he was being compared to Umesh and Ashoke?,47
the fake crowd makes this unwatchable,3
"**Pat Cummins**

Last match - 0/49(3) and this match - 1/11(3).  Brilliant comeback!!",7
Seriously worried for the middle order. Shankar being injured was a big blow. I hope Abhishek Sharma shines. He needs to do what Deepak Hooda couldn’t for us.,4
40-1 isn't too bad as far as poweplays go. Just that this is the last batting pair.,8
"Cummins is looking really fiery today. May be proving everyone wrong who trolled him for a bad day against MI. Great bowling, he really is a premier fast bowler.",3
Damn Kuldeep got tanned.,1
Pretty Ass Garg coming in next,2
I don't like this tease with Nagarkoti,5
Nabi looks younger than Rashid,4
SRH has as edge here. Negate Cummins 4th over (if h gets one) and you're all set with Warner and Pandey on the crease,1
Lmao Warner is going after kuldeep from first hall,2
The DJ who handles background sound seems to be drunk.,2
"Only thing I know about Hyderabad is that they apparently have great biryani, that's a plus",10
Kuldeep wearing short sleeves looks so weird lmao,3
Those fake cheers are getting worse with every match,8
The crowd noise is so out of sync,7
Looks like Kuldeep's dropped a few kilos.,2
Warner looks in a different mood today; eager to make up for missing out last game.,3
The guy playing stadium noises hasn't slept in a long while it seems.,5
What happened to Kuldeep's complexion? Looks baked.,5
Warners singles are really turning on the crowds today,2
Batsmans game man. They show bowlers economy but not batters avg,3
"It's called stumping and not mankanding if you are in strike warner, don't wander to half crease to spinner",2
Is there a way to send feedback to the IPL production team? Because whoever is it should have figured it out by the 8th game.,2
Why does u/CricketMatchBot have RCB flair ?,7
I have a feeling Warner will destroy CoolDeep today,7
Cummo kya tum mere baccho ki maa banogi :'(,7
I want Manish Pandey to perform today the same way Sanju Samson and Mayank Agarwal performed from their respective teams,1
Next over Nagarkotti,5
"Warner yelling like the stadium is packed, you love to see it",11
"why do some match threads have 5 suns , sometimes 5 clouds?",5
 Who will keep foe srh saha or Baristow,1
"""Oh there she is, the beauty altroz"", swann forgot to add /s",20
Isn't it like too much to ask of Nagarkoti to bowl in the death on debut?,5
Cummins looking much better than the last game. A player of his caliber should need or use real match as a warm-up.,2
I love it when Graeme Swann orgasms over the Altroz,16
Warner has had his difficulties with reading Kuldeep in particular. Hopefully it gets better today.,4
Damn I didn't think Gayle was that consistent,3
That's clearly *Deshi Deshi basara*,2
*Warner anna stay in the crease pls*,5
You could tell Warner had a flashback,5
Warner playing safe knowing that the tail starts next,7
Hope to see Rana bowl today,4
I think my cringe meter exploded with that altroz shoutout in the dugout,3
What's with so many players wearing double caps this season?,1
Do the commentators get paid to hype up the Altroz?,7
[My current setup](https://i.imgur.com/9VMKx2u.png),4
2.5 years + 7 overs and counting,3
The dugout promoting altroz is hilarious.,4
Gold standard of a hot hatch? Golf R or nothing. Stop shoving a pos car as your gold std.,2
Mithun is here,1
"T20 is clearly designed for children, women, the mentally incapacitated, the weak willed, gypsies, homosexuals and other undesirables. Whereas test cricket is the last bastion of moral strength left in our degenerate society.

Comparing T20 to test cricket, is like comparing chimpanzees screeching wildly as they throw shit at a wall, to a symphony written by translating the chess moves in 'Kasparov vs Topalov' into music. There is no comparison. To be honest, test cricket would be the foundation of my ideal society, with the most successful test captain becoming the leader of the nation, as the mixture of intelligence and strategic thinking needed to captain a test side would mean they could easily lead any country into prosperity. T20 would be ok for kids, but once they reach their thirteenth birthday they would have to burn the brightly coloured garb associated with the ""sport"" and would be told ""you're man now, learn to block"".",6
One of the worst feelings in IPL is having to root for a foreigner in your franchise over a young Indian talent in the opposition,5
The architect is here to bowl.,2
DK is a Tollywood dancer,2
Petition to play EA Cricket '07 tracks in place of cringe item numbers in the stadium.,4
Didn't Varun go for a large amount of money a couple of years ago?! Or was it Kariappa?,1
Chakrabooty,3
How strong was that throw that fell DK!?,5
No nagarkoti again..they had him for the bowling or his batting,2
Ahahah DK using ad boards to set the field,1
Why do we design such ugly cars and bikes?,3
Morgan back with 2 caps,1
"He absolutely got the mystery beaten out of him, last time he played",2
Varun Chakraborty pursuing cricket after doing his architecture degree gives me hope. Except i habe no talent. Or age. Or money. Or time. Or health.,5
Seems to me that actual captaincy is being done by Morgan,3
"If I ever start my company, I will ask Danny Morrison to hype it up.

Can't wait for another 130-150 score and losing the match by 5-7 wickets.,3

Be You Nick is playing cricket now?,2
David! Calm tf down.,2
Manish with the wannabe orange cap,3
"Lmao,where did the ball go? Who is he",5
DAE think Chakravarthy looks like the YouTuber Be You Nick?,2
Damn Warner’s fast today,3
Manish is an expert at finding the fielders,6
Pandey needs to add more scoring areas in addition to the mid-wicket. Each team has a deep mid-wicket for him.,2
I have never really seen DK angry. Have you?,1
"It cracks me up that Banno Tera Swagger is playing, and Warner probably knows the song 🎵",6
Ranaji got lost,1
Good first over!,2
Man Warner is tiring out himselves. Hopefully he connects a few.,3
Ali Khan and Nitish Rana look similar.,1
DK taking just as long to set a field as he does to take his stance smh,2
"Today looks like dew might make a difference,it already looks really humid",1
NOOOOOO,3
That was a good over.,1
Lmao Warner is so itching to play that reverse sweep,3
Y is warner smiling?,1

Wow Dinesh Karthik is heckuva loud behind the stumps,2
davey is srh's only hope and kkr's greatest fear rn,1
I thought I saw Manish Pandey hit a six somewhere! How is he still 10(11),6
Is Kanos still injured or do we need to organize a change.org petition for Kanos to change his last name from Williamson to Patel? I think we have been through enough shit in 2020 to be deprieved of the best back foot cover drives,9
I feel chinaman is the least racist slur of them all.,1
"Warner saying ""you told him to bowl a carrom ball"" with a smile when DK shouted something in Tamil(?)",4
is it me or Kuldeep looks a lot taller now,2
"Pandey only finds fielders

Fielding is toit!,3
Nagarkoti playing as a specialist fielder,2
Nitish Rana has looks of best friend of Ayushmann Khurrana film.,4

Kuldeep crying face,2
Kuldeep is good for hitting sixes..,4

Moeen really broke Kuldeep that night.,6

Kuldeep hasn't been the same since that over against Moeen last year tbh,1
Almost hit the car,3
oye hoye pandeyji!,1
Don't feed Kuldeep to these ex-kkr batsmen,0
Manish Pandey asserts his dominance over r/cricket by hitting a maximum,3

Pandey don't give a fuck,-1

So sad that Kuldeep has been figured out by almost everyone. Opposition teams have tons of video data these days that no one stays a mystery for too long. A boon of our times for sportspersons.,-4

He was just testing if the car was actually a good standard when it comes to safety,1

Kuldeep needs to be in CSK or with Chahal in any team,1

We need our Pacers to do really well. Looks like a 150-160,1
Nagarkoti is playing as batsman.,7
It's only been 9 overs? Feels like the game has been going for ages!,4
I'd love to see Manish Pandey open with Rohit Sharma in T20 / ODI for India,-6

Sunsetters Hyderabad,3
And thats the game. Gg KKR,1
Good win KKR,2
KKR's crowd realised 2 seconds late that they had to cheer.,3
Kkr is into the tail boys!!,4
So is DK a good captain after all?,0
RIP SRH 100 lmao,0
Did his job VC,1
Swann should pick my lottery ticket,1
"**9.1** Varun to Warner, OUT, **got him first ball after the break!** What a return for this guy. **59-2**

DA Warner c &amp; b Varun 36 (30b 2x4 1x6) SR: 120.00",0
This CRED add is funny and shittiest at the same time,4
Alright guys. Just put the second loss in the Points table now,1
Simple.,1
End me,2
Warner got trapped in Chakravarty chakra,3
McCullum patting Nayar looks like strategy worked,1
Are we gonna reach even 120 now?,1
So this match is gonna be a bore from now?:(,1
The Anti-Jynxers are in early.,-1
Weak is a understatement for this middle order,4
"That was the Mendis Googly!!

Bamboozled a lot of people. Warner shouldn't feel bad.",1
"Fuck if cumdog does well, KKR looks like they have a kick ass bowling lineup.",2
That is the easiest return catch I have ever seen,-1
Kane better fucking play next match this is atrocious,2
Chakravarthy with the Murali eyes there!,4
Feels like KKR may win this game but this is cricket and anything is possible.,1
My eyes would light up like that too if Warner gave me his wicket like that,1
\*Switches off TV\*,1
Ok bye bye match over...,1
Okay my book doesn't have reference for Varun Chakravarty and architect. Someone let me know please.,-1
Who's DK talking to in Tamil,-1
I know Saha has an IPL 100 but he really isn't fit to play this late in a T20,2
Saha at 4 lol.,-1
"Their batting is weak as is, why include Saha?",1
That's my boi.,-3
That's out if there's no inside edge,3
Hahaha we're fucked,3
Varun is bought for 6 Crores no?,1
"Oh man seeing Saha gives me major early KKR nostalgia.

They sucked tho.",-2
Isn't that plumb!?,0
Baffling! Why wouldn't you send Garg now. He's not a finisher. He's an accumulator and that's who we need right now.,2
Inb4 less than 120,2
Should review it imo,1
"Common saha, atleast 30 if not 300",6
How's SRH tail for batting?,0
Chakravarty looks like a good no nonsense bowler.,6
this seems like a bad appeal.,-1

Good review,0
Fuck Swann talking over the third ump,6
Except for that one century is Saha any good at t20,0
Would that be a flat line because it could be air rumbling? Idk why it was given flat line.,2

Been waiting for Nagarkoti to bowl all this while,2
Wheres KC Cariappa?,-1
This is our Test XI.,2
And that my friends is the denominator of the society.,-2
Umpires call strikes again,2
A strategic timeout is almost always beneficial to the bowling side. This is fine when the batsmen are taking the bowlers to the cleaners but the match becomes boring when even before the timeout the RR was slow.,0
SRH batting order totally sucks openers can't even play freely no trust on middle Order,1
SRH tuktuk giving CSK'S tuktuk a run for their money,8
WTF happened Kayo came from a timeout break and Warner was gone,2
Knowing that crores of people are going to watch the IPL I won't do that kind of shit what those dream11 champion fans do,4
Collapse is still on. Just got delayed a bit.,6
Real cringe is these fan dances,5
Dont worry dudes Saha's about to hit the fastest century in IPL history,9

They should send in Abhishek next,2
"Now the whole match is basically ""who's batting is worse""",8
Mavi just patted Varun on the cheek lol,2
Match so boring I thought CSK was playing,6
KKR has 8 bowling options. Russell & Nagarkoti yet to come. Rana also has some knack for taking big wickets.,0
What is the point of umpires call? If ball tracking is hitting the stumps it should be given out no? Half the ball hitting the stumps still results in the bails coming off.,0
Where the fuck is Nagarkoti,1
"With Warner & Bairstow gone, where is the fire power?",1
Inb/4 Saha scored a ipl century in 1997...,1
Why did Tom Moody leave SRH? Built an awesome team with lesser known names.,0
Why tuktuk SRH?,1
Prince is here.,0
CSK might even make it to the playoffs if teams are as unconvincing as SRH.,0
Is kamlesh nagarkoti not going to bowl?,-1

Domino's pizza will still taste like 100% cardboard even with 50% discount so no thanks,1

Why are we playing like CSK yo,-1
"KKR has shubhman Gill, Russell, Eoin morgan..",-1

David Hussey looks like he is 70 years old,-1
Wtf is this interview,7
Where are those idiots who said let's not blame SRH management. We don't have a single fucking hitter beyond Warner and YJB. It's a fucking Test IX + openers.,8
The speed is still there which is a good sign for nagarkoti.,5
SRH needs a partnership..,1
What's the speed of those balls from Nagarkoti?,6
"Wtf! Kamlesh bowling like Tait. All speed, no direction!",-6

Most boring match so far. Jesus. How long since the last boundary?,5

Better crawl to 120 and then hit some boundaries than try to slog now and have another collapse to 69 all out,3
Somebody get us a good middle order.,4
Srh should bite the bullet and play Kane. They have the Indian bowlers to not play nabi. Their middle order desperately needs Kane,0

**DK** 's Nagar**GOTI** is kul**DEEP** into Chakra**BOOTY** and he **CUM**ming**S**,3
Do srh have any Indian players who can replace one of bairstow/warner at the top without losing out too much? Williamson would be huge on these wickets.,2
Warner and Bairstow batting long last season covered the cracks in the SRH lineup. Them not being in form has led to this,3
That has got to be the trashiest song ever played in a stadium,2
All these downvotes.... that's it for IPL. RIP,2
Wtf? DJ playing kethup song?,2
M pandey to saha bh**dk scorecard dekh le,9
Kkr is playing one too many bowlers it feels like. Varun Chakravarty has bowled well but you already have Kuldeep and Narine as your main spinners and nitish Rana can bowl some spin too. Unless you are expecting that Mavi and nagarkoti don't finish their quota.,2

"Batter: hits the ball to a fielder

DJ: HOOOOOORRRRAAAAYYYYYYY",14
"SRH are exposed every time they lose their openers. It’s unsustainable to rely on them for every game, every season. They have only been an elite team because Warner actually does it season in season out. 

It’s not commonly said but the team management has really botched it with their batting line up because they always make the playoffs. 

To not have any batting after 3, not one recognizable name where teams have guys who can hit till 6 and 7. Some have superstar finishers. 

SRH don’t have a batting order. They have recycled so many no name batsmen with other upcoming no name batsmen. One or two are fine to plug the gaps but your whole line up can’t be that. 

It was criminal to release Dhawan. Indian International players are gold dust in the IPL. You have to play 7 Indians in your XI, meaning atleast 56 Indians have to play in the IPL every year. There are tops 15-20 genuinely international level proven Indian players.The team with the most Indians  who are international caliber and international superstars always win.",18

At this point even 150ish will be ok,3

People abusing saha here. He's up against some good bowling and a sluggish pitch.,4

why send saha ..could have sent nabi instead.,5
Good speed..,4
Saha's strike rate above 50. Light the crackers.,10
even commentators are running out of things to say,8
Atleast score around 140-150😭,1
Nagarkotti might be getting the most speed per kg body weight of all bowlers.,2
Saha is one of those players bowlers refuse to dismiss,2
Look at that action !,2
Saha at number 4 is peak strategy,8
Wtf... Sahas strike rate crossed 60 with  that couple.... Slog overs here we come,8
Saha making a statement to be selected for the test squad for the Australia tour,8
nagarkoti lowkey handsome tho 😳😳😳,10
Saha is from Bengal. Just saying.,4
In the past SRH were satisfied for anything around 140 150. Not so sure if they can do it anymore.,2
Yeah sure the IPL is great but all cricket fans know that the WBBL is the best T20 comp on the planet,2
Dugout has run out of positive things to say about this batting,6
11 off 17 Saha. fml,3
Kane can't come back soon enough,5
If they bat till lunch without a wicket then I think in the next session they can capitalise,7
"Holy shit that action is gorgeous, I want him to go as far as he can. Hopefully that means running through test line ups in 5-6 years",11
Every over is a wicket alert over atm,2
"This is very accurate from Nagarkoti
Edit: whoops",3
Saha just fuk off🙏,2
*Finally a boundary*,2
You know you're going to have a great career when you're compared to Ajit Agarkar. /s,2

"Looking at the increasing number of bowling options in KKR, i think they will be the first team in IPL to say *sabko bowling milega re*",4

SRH should open with Saha in the 2nd innings. He can hold one end and play for the draw. Manish/Bairstow don't have the technique/temperament to succeed in these testing conditions,36
Finally ffs,8
Finally a boundary,10
Holy fuck that’s a boundary holy fucking shit a boundary we hit a boundary you guys,79
It's strange how I cannot figure out if it's a 4 or 1 because AUDIENCE STARTS CHEERING FOR EVERY FUCKING SHOT,65
4d Chess move: Saha is just there to irritate Pandey into playing with intent™.,21

I can see Pandey getting out trying to over compensate saha's incompetence,8

Nagarkoti looks like fast bowling version of Jadeja,6

This thread is so toxic. It has a way higher proportion of toxic comments compared to an average match thread. Get a grip of yourself /r/cricket.,8
SRH is missing 3D as much as CSK is missing Rayudu.,7
Pandey hits boundary... SRH fans we consider this as absolute victory,9
Saha showing shades of Nidahas Shankar.,5
Harsha Bhogle should move to Dugout. He would fit right in.,6
RemindMe! Next boundary,14
You know the team is messed up when you want a number 4 batsman to get off strike and you treat them like a number 11,2
"Pandey - "" Why am I still here, just to suffer ? """,3
Saha is gonna hear it in the break,8
Single off the last ball for Saha. Fml,2
3 fours/3 sixes so far in 13 overs,1
Nagarkoti's pace has reduced consistently bowling between 130-140. Earlier it was 150+,1
"SRH playing for NRR, even though it's the first innings.

Revolutionary tactics",76
Why not play Abhisek Sharma in case of Bairstow at top? Bairstow can bat at 4 as well. So make Warner and Abhishek Sharma open and you have a strong middle order with Bairstow and Nabi.,2
Just 2 wickets and SRH already seems like it's on deathbed,14
"There have been 4 fours, 3 sixes in this game

Says a lot",3
Runs are so hard to come by that the fake noise guy was instructed to put max volume for singles,7
Saha has been sent at 4 to force Manish to increase his strike rate.,7
11 runs of one over ? Are they being too reckless ? They can take it easy till 35-40th over. Have wickets in hand for the final 10 overs. One of these 2 batsman has to play till the end. Probably Saha as he looks more set and in control.,10
Whats with the stupidly shallow batting line ups teams are putting out. There's like 4 good srh batsmen.,2
Funny how I didn't check the venue before the match but the DJ was enough to recognise it was abu dhabi,5
Another nrr innings?,3

6 years ago Saha scored a 100 against KKR in the finals while Manish scored a match winning 90 for KKR in the same game. Crazy seeing them bat together today.,24
"4 fours, 3 sixes, 2 wickets in 14 overs

This innings is sooooo quiet",7
Pandey striking double of Saha lmao,4
Looks like no Russell today,3
This IPL has not been kind on the Yadavs,10
SRH please make enough runs for Russell to come in and hit a few out of the park. I don't want to see another snoozefest in 2nd innings,2
The downvoter last came in the last KKR game I think? So The person picks his targets on KKR games,1
Rumor has it that Anushka is offended because she learned that Virat Kohli plays with 'balls' for fun. She asked him to respect balls,3

"Ohh man, this one's turning out to be a real boring:(",2
Please Narine get saha out and end our suffering then at least nabi can come and help srh get to a respectable total,2
Saha needs to do a Pandaya here. Go deep in the crease and absolutely smash the stumps,5
Saha mann come on! Send one out of the park,1
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzunrizers,5

Take a review you dick heads!,5

What the fuck is that poll question. How can you even consider anything other than Raina's 87(25)?,4
Take the review Pandey.,-1
Narine in Narayan mode.,2
with bhuvi and Rashid bowling bowling on this track we can defend 130... Just hope they get something more than that,3
Narine doesn't want Saha's wicket. He didn't even appeal,4
Commentators throwing shades at DK,3
"14.2 Narine to Manish Pandey, 1 run, another quick offie from a short of length, Pandey stabs it to extra cover and hares to the other end

14.1 Narine to W Saha, 1 run, flat offbreak from a length, punched wide of cover off the backfoot

That has been story of the innings so far",4
Fuck this shit. Time to tune into the bollywood drug scandal news,12
KKR praying to not get Saha out,0
I may be biased but for me best batting performance by an Indian in one inning is Manish Pandey's 96 against KXIP in 2014 IPL final.,2
Saha looking very rusty,3
Not even considering review for Saha since keeping him in the crease is great for KKR,6
Upvote karte karte ungli dukhne lagi bhosadike downvoteee band kar,2
Lmao can someone please get Saha out so we can get Nabi/Rashid/Abishek in,1
IPL to all the senior players - Future is now old man !,-1
What are they waiting for?,0
I think IPL is the only league across where you get 10 mins of Strategic time in a match. Money makers for sponsers. Basically you are getting around 200 million people watching your shampoo ads lmao,0
"Saha..my man.. Just end your own misery. Hit the stump with your bat, like we used to do in gully cricket.",10
And the crowd goes RAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH,4
At least tomorrows match is going to be a cracker.,1
saha is no t20 match m8,2
What is the fan club of K L Rahul called? Kelas?,1

Umm how about Dhonis inning from 2 matches ago where he reduced the quatum of defeat? Best inning imo,-5
CSK should trade Sam Curren for Saha.,0

Hope KKR be generous and give some runs in extras.",3
"Downvoters have returned, their atrophied digits live to click another day.",1
I am failing to understand SRH plan here. There is no sense of urgency.,4
Saha is just eating balls lmao,1
Came here to see you village cricketers shit on IPL centurions Pandey and Saha for slow run rate. Wasn't disappointed,-1
can Garg smash it he looked ordinary last match and in the u19 tournament,1
"If Saha doesn't go big now , he's fuckin useless",2
So the take away is don't win the toss,1

"Last 5 overs, they need to start hitting atleast now",1
Kkr trying their best not to get Saha out,1
Pandeyji **INTENT**,1
They've barely middled any of these shots against the spinners,1
They ain't connecting shit,2
Saha give us some sixes please. I’m neutral but this is boring,2
Can't hit anything but can't get out either,1
Can they score 70-80 runs in last 5 ?,1
Manish Pandey's innings vs Punjab in the final of 2014 for KKR was also an excellent innings.,3
Seems like it's not only CSK that has forgotten about Raina.,5
Nobody except Warner seems concerned with the way game is going at the moment in that dugout.,2
Oh yeah I remember Garg now.. he's Ravindra Jadeja Jr..,2
Wriddhiman Slowni,0
"78%, are you kidding me? Short memories",6
Fuck off Saha,1

"Fuck off!!

Rishabh Pant 128 was much better, he didn't need 2 life either.",7
Someone tell Saha he's not playing a test match,2
LEG WORK FROM SAHA OMG,0
Best innings by an Indian is Raina's 87 and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.,7
"""That's more intent from Saha!""

Straight to fielder for a single",5
Is there an option to declare in t20's?,4
Saha showing the selectors he should be chosen above Pant in test cricket,2
Imagine the only boundary you see is that of KL from h/l pkg lol.,7
Manish needs to do a Faf and get Saha run out,4
7 boundaries this game lmao,3
Raina’s 87 (25) was better than KL’s knock lol. Recency bias affecting th poll.,21

Lmao Saha,-1
Funnily enough the only thing I remember first off the top of my head about past IPLs is Wridhhiman's Saha's 100 in the finals in 2014 I think it was.,2
Where are my fellow KLPDians??,0
Sahaaaaa bc get out pls,2
Manish Pandey is only player who when struggles to accelerate he doesn't get out quickly. Very lucky player over the years.,-1
100 in 15 overs is fantastic score - for an ODI,5
Let's just hope they don't send Garg when the inevitable wicket falls.,2
Fucking FINALLY,1
They have like 4ppl who can come in and they are playing like they are in their last wicket,2
This mf just left a bowl outside off,2
Damn Saha hit a six finally,1
What's this miracle,4
Oh my god Saaha hit it finally,2
How about Bhajji's 65 against KXIP at Wankhede?,3
Start of something huge?,-2
He's leaving balls lmaooo,0
Fuck finally a connection,2
Saha mann that is infuriating,1
Saha silences r/cricket with that six,16
Why is this considered boring? I'd rather watch a few great spells of bowling then a flurry of boundaries.,16
My boi Saha,5
Beautiful leave Saha!,5
Holy Shit! Saha >> Dhoni,6
Fucking finally,2
10 more of those please,5
Saha leaving balls like it’s test,6

Saha showing loyalty to his montherland!!😂🤣😂,6
Saha breaking character,4
Couple more of those please,4
"Lmao looks like u srh ""fans"" wanna see last games collapse again",1
KKR should try not to get a wicket from here,2
I hate to say it but Saha's innings reminds me of classic Dhoni...,6
I'll take 150 at this point,2
WRIDDHIMAN SAHA HAS HIT A SIX. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.WRIDDHIMAN SAHA HAS HIT A SIX.,8
Saha trynna pull a dhoni by waiting till last minute or smt,1

Let better sense prevail and send Nabi next. He can salvage whatever balls left atleast.,4
Saha reaching MVijay Strike Rate levels.,3
Y'all acting like Saha doesn't know how to bat,0
Giving wicket alert in death overs..  Never change dugout,0
I really hope something happens here. Last two games have been a complete snooze fest.,4
is it just me or hotstar's stuck for anyone else?,6
UPVOTING ALL THE COMMENTS TO KEEP THE DOWNVOTER AWAY,3
Its probably fucking cold already in NYC,2
Best IPL innings by an Indian was Aditya Tate's 6 against RR to knock them out of play offs.,1
Hotstar.exe has stopped working,3
Cummo has got this entire team in the cabin,3
"Now hotstar fuking with us ,great",5
At this point screw the batsman...bring in nabi and rashid after a wicket. They will probably be 2 overs left,6
"Does anyone know what a ""Jigger Thanda"" is?",1
"We keep bashing Saha, but at least he’s better than Shankar",1
Daaamn!! Mavi and Nagarkotti to bowl last 4 most probably. Some confidence!,3
Saha could do better if he keeps his bat face square while attempting to clear the ground.,1
Hotstar stream stuck for anyone?,7
Seems like a 140-150 wicket seeing the way these two have been trundling about.,-1
I feel like 140 might be difficult to chase here too,-2
"Oh man, this is giving me nostalgic 2013 vibes. Let's try and defend 140- totals like the good old days!",-2
Who's the finisher of srh?,1
Saha is playing worse than Iyer yesterday.,-1

Is Hotstar stuck at that car ad for everyone?,4
This is the first time I have seen Narain dive,3

"RCBs gotta wait, they have strong contenders in SRH and KKR for wooden spoon.",2

Good innings pandey,2
Pandey batting at a SR of 143 on this pitch is really good,2
"Damn 140+ SR from Manish, he's doing his job well for once.",2
Well played!,2
Pandey's game reminds me of Kanos,5
"Legendary innings here by Saha

JP Duminy must be proud watching on",6
"What dog shit level is the other commentator next to Harsha? ""Players should run in a straight line"", as if most are zigzagging during their run.",6
Fuck Hotstar,3
"Pandey and Saha have seen off the new ball successfully.

Second session should be easier for SRH batting.",6
Chakravarti looks like he'd be right at home as a nightwatchman at a haunted mansion in a Ramsay brothers movie..,4
Patty Cummins showing his class tonight 👏👏,10
"Saha following MSD's strategy. Play at 60 SR, wait until last 3 overs and hit a 4 & 6 to reach a 100+ SR. All looks good in the end. Clearly, they all discussed this over zoom calls",6
Applause noise borrowed from English stadiums,2
"150 will be ok from here, 160 at best?",6
Great spell Cummings.,3
Like ik im armchair judging but how hard is it to just hit the ball hard and just not worry about the outcome....there are still many batsman to come with only a few wickets,5
I don’t know where the word “maximum” started but I’m pretty sure it came from a millennial on Instagram,2
Cummins came back so strongly in this match.,11
What's with this team annihilating innings from Saha,4
15 cr justified today?,1
Did MG Gloster pay Hotstar for a long ad?,2
"Deccan Chargers scoring 140

Steyn 4-1-12-2
Mishra 4-0-18-2

The problem is the overs of Harmeet Singh and Jaskaran Singh. They would go for plenty",8
i hope pandey doesn't try to take too many risks from here. looks like a pitch that needs batsman to be set to score some runs.,-2
Beautiful spell from Cummo,3

"30 runs in 3 overs and we have a competitive match on table. 
Also, what happens to siddharth kaul?",1
Around 150-160 will be decent enough to defend,-1
Where the kkr fans at? Spare us the monotony of srh fans gibberish.,5
118-2 in 17? A sub-160 score with just 2 wickets down by the end of 17 is pretty atrocious.,1
"Honestly, only side whose batting looks formidable other than well established MI is DC !

"Saha is too slow, he's dragged the team total down by 15. Nabi is one of the best T20 finishers in the world right now, he needs to be in.",1
Surely Mavi should have come now,1
Nabi and Rashid should bowl 8 good overs of spin. Wonder if Abhishek Sharma will get the full 4 overs,1
Why not bowling nagarkotti,1
Kkr playing with 8 bowlers,1
"How much did Saha earn this IPL? Dhawan asked 6crores ,we denied. Fucking hell",7
laaame,0
Take Russell to the cleaners boys. Gonna see lot of slower ones though.,0
Nabi hitting for at least 2 overs could make a massive difference for us,7
What happened to Kane Williamson,5
Russell gets as many balls to bowl as he gets to bat.,1
Russell! That's a surprise!,1
LOL how many bowlers is too many hahaha???,1
KLPDians will destroy Smithians tomorrow. Beware !!,4
Saha go for it or just make way for Abhishek,3
I think i have to get used to the low scores by srh.,3
2 wickets down and you're getting 7-8 runs per over in the last 5... Such a shitty display of batting.,3
Dk is so fucking smart. He is nt letting them bowl because of the risk of no balls,3
Saha. Fuck you,4
Saha with his 25 off 27 is still half decent for us and that kinda shows how shit we are.,5
What's Saha's game here?,4
Saha with the 'I am with Dhoni' innings,9
Saha get the fuck out,7
"Nice innings from Saha, he’s seen out the new ball so that the middle order can capitalise in the  next sessions.",1
This artificial russel chant is making my ears bleed,2
This pitch is not as bad as Saha's numbers make it out to be. What a trash knock,2
*Saha trying to hit like ABD for those singles.*,3
That arabian song playing on the speakers sounds eerily similar to a famous tamil song.,7
Saha - Man. It's hard to score. It's even harder to get out,3
Russel - The Specialist Death Bowler & Finisher,3
Please Russell just get Saha out so that Rashid khan or nabi can come in and smash the bowling,2
Can Saha be mankaded or get a hit wicket or smt. I don’t think I ever prayed for someone to get out this much,4
Get out so Nabi can come in and smash it,2
"Solid from Russell, this is turning out well",2
"Mouth watering contest tom

Both coming after smashing their opposition n outbatting them

Wud be an absolute runfeast",3
Sending Saha up the order can cost srh the match and me the fantasy points,2
Worst 1st innings so far in IPL,0
"Best bowler in the last match

Gets one over today",3
Not a no ball?,2
Wtf was that,3
Are keeper batsmen told that you can't hit >100 SR?,6
NO BALL,3
Finally some drama,2
No ball,2
Saha showing us why he's the first choice in tests,8
Kkr will look to prevent Saha from getting out.,5
Too high.,1
Not no bal,2
Fuck this. Just call it out and let's give the Win to KKR,8
74 vs 132 isn't even a comparison FFS.,5
I’d rather have the wicket and bring in someone who can actually hit in the death,7
"Man eating idli

Dhoni : I will take care of this. You go play dream 11.",16
Thats out ☝,5
I think that's out,3
Manish is like if you ain’t getting out I will get out you coward,11
Why does Saha keep giving himself so much space to play it along the ground?,3
Out clearly,4
Soft dismissal,5
What was he trying to do there,5
Looked out to me tbh. Surely surprised Pandey,7
Looks good to me.,2
"No ball or otherwise, why didn't he have a full swing at it. 

You gotta try to clobber it regardless",9
n that’s p out,4
How much does Russel get ?,1
"2 wickets down in the 17th, had 3 full tosses this over and not a single boundary. Beyond embarrassing.",1
That's below sorry,3
"**17.4** Russell to Pandey, OUT,  **121-3**

MK Pandey c &amp; b Russell 51 (38b 3x4 2x6) SR: 134.21",2
Knee-length full toss is a low-key good strategy at the death lmao.,3
Good T20 death bowling,2
This is what Lee meant when he called a full toss an underrated delivery. You just gotta know when and how to use it.,9
How the fuck Harsha that is above waist height ?,7
"No look I'm sorry that's below the waist, sure, but bowling almost waist high full tosses should not be a fucking legitimate wicket taking strategy for fast bowlers. I'm saying this as a bowler. That shouldn't be on.",5
stupid way to get out.,2
Nabi would be the best person to send now imo,2
Shoutout to the umpires for actually trying and improving on their decision making.,9
"There is Nabi, Abhishek Sharma still left FFS",3
Why is pandey doling out catching practice,2
Saha has a 17/18 ball hundred in club cricket,7
Saha is going to be not out today.,13
Lol Manish,5
"Pandey is on his toes and has his shirt high tucked, when he played the shot. How the actual fuck is that not waist high??",6
Well played Pandey ji👏,2
Clearly wasn't looking to scote runs and was surprised,2
Having Saha at #4 is not good enough.,6
Credit where it's due. Fraud played a decent innings out there. Must keep this form up instead of blowing hot and cold alternative match days.,2
Hit it anywhere but Pandey chose to hit it to bowler.,2
I cant believe I have found a team more shittier than rcb and 2020 csk,5
"Bumbrah - I can bowl yorkers all day

Russell - Can you bowl a beamer directed to the crotch with that accuracy?",19
"Gotta say ..... this has been some awful batting today. Bruh this is T20. What are you guys playing so defensively for? 

121 after 17 overs is pretty pathetic, especially with 6 more wickets at hand......",8
"Hell, even CSK has a better batting line up than SRH. Too top heavy and low on firepower beyond #3.",5
"car dekho ad with Dravid is the most ""they gave me money so I have to do this"" ad ever",7

Wow! Russell hitting at 145Kph!,5
Why no Rashid )-:,3
"Look guys,free runs",7
They should use Hawkeye to determine if the ball crossing at a height above the stumps. Above waist height is such a vague rule lmao,5
"Pandey wanting to bat through

Shah saying Ye me kar leta hoon aap jake d11 me team banao",9
"Saha, Kab kaholega re tera khoon?",1
Just logged in. Is kkr bowling very well or srh being poor?,3
What a shot lmao,10
Saha can't believe it.,7
"Haha, this is a joke now.",5
Too many bowling options for KKR. It will be a real test of DK's captaincy in coming matches also. Today rotated well,6
Absolutely comical all around,11
That was a 5D shot,8
That's the only way Saha can get boundary this innings,14
LMAO,8
Even ABD can't play that shot,10
That was probably for the better.,8
Russell is underrated death bowler,5
"Saha riding his luck like a Tesla, on autopilot",12
That was the worst four I've ever seen in my life,6
That fielding effort is one for the bloopers reel.,9
Aren't you the best young fielder in the country,11
Not complaining but what the fuck was that,12
I take any runs at this point.,4
Nabi has come in 2-3 overs late .Top 4 - Scoring Under 120 for 15+ balls should be declared a crime !,5
Obviously they don't want Saha to get out here,7
The fuck was he doing jumping like that ?,5
Russel's bowling at similar speeds to Nagarkoti.,7
"What the fuck is that , he should have caught it. Anyway, runs are runs.",5
U are not spiderman!,4
"Good acting from KKR - to make it look like the drop makes a big difference. 

Keeping Saha in here is way better for KKR",7
LOL,1
Couple of 6s at least now will make Saha's trash innings into decent. Just went past 100+ SR now.,1
Absolutely appalling fielding. Making a moderately tough catch look impossible and costing your team precious runs,3
Hahaha. *Village* cricket at its finest,2
With that dive I thought nagarkoti was done for the season,1
Did I tune into village cricket?,1
LMAO literally was trying to hit on the leg side and went for nearly a six at third man... The bats nowadays.,1
Tactical drop,2
Brian Lara had heart problems last year while working out when in India for the Dugout didn't he?,3
Kkr's fielding is so bad this game. Misfield and dropped catches come on.,1
What was Kamlesh trying to do there? Putting forward his name for Catch of the season?,1
That's a really poor slip up with an awesome athletic strech,2
"Why Saha always fall playing off side as if he trying to convey it's hard to play ?













No his short-ass can't reach that end.",0
KKR would rather give away a boundary than get Saha out. Understandable.,4
"Unfortunate 5 runs added to rusell 

Was never wide

Nagar messes the catch n lets it go for 4 lol",5
Who is leading in your fantasy team?,1
That boundary is absolutely meme-worthy.,5
"""Jadejaesque""",2
"Fuck , looking at the score we gonna have to dig up the grave and produce a classic SRH choke",1
Bangar was saying nagarkoti was one of the best fielders in india,1
[deleted],1
Saha is using all his luck stats today. This man can win all lotteries today. Warner should open the bowling with him.,2
Saha will hit a 30 run over now,1
"Saha flexing, he just needs 40 mm of wood to hit a boundary",2
"Get to 150, folks. We can do this..",3
Wasn't Harsha calling for Saha to play at 3/4 for srh. Does he know SRH want to play T20 and not tests,1
"If Nabi doesn't hit shit here, I want all the obnoxious Afghan/Bangla fans to shut the fuck up",-1
Tactfully placed by Saha.,1
This will be the most comical ipl imo,1
Srh can defend low totals. Just go for 140+,2
Guess KKR's bowling strategy is to give everyone a go in 20 overs...,1
Pretty sure that drop was on purpose. Would much rather have Saha batting than Rashid,2
This mishit is the first four Saha has hit this inning lmao,1
As a KKR fan i feel it is better to have Saha at the crease than have Rashid clobber us like he did in the 2018 semis lol,5
KKR not taking any chances against Saha,2
Arre Cumlace,3
[deleted],1
"Bowling yorkers around the wicket, if you can, to right hand batsman seems to be a good tactic cuz most of the batsmen hit big shots towards on side and are not used to hitting inside out over the cover.",1
"Don’t blame Saha, they didn’t tell him it’s not a test match",7
"Nagarkoti drops a sitter while SRH limping with a RR of <7:



KKR: **Oh no**




  **Anyway**",22
Play kane ffs,2
Wasted lol,2
Saha is basically a specialist keeper in this srh side,8
The fielding this IPL clearly shows lack of match practice. We need to be kinder,9
Why doesn't Russel bowl his full Quota,3
[deleted],-2
"So, it took Wriddhiman Saha 29 balls and 18th over to cross 100+ Strike Rate. He is SRH no. 4 batsman  🤔",11
Finally a shot with I N T E N T,10
What a slap by Nabi,11
[deleted],9
Better see Kane in the next match. Warner/JB/Pandey/KW is a respectable top 4,1
"Saha look BC. Thats how you hit. Powerless cunt, couldn't clear 30 yards",3
Asking to be hit,2
Russell comes in casually at the death with his medium pace and almost picks two wickets. Easy AF,6
Finally some intent. Took ages!,2
Is it me or does Nagarkoti just look like a shrunken Mavi?,1
That one nabi shot has more intent than all of sahas inning,13
Garg would've done much better than Saha here in my unbiased opinion,8
Help us habibi Nabi 😔,13
Tracer bullet,5
Nabi needs to bat 4 if he's playing.,5
Saha - You can take me out of tests but you can't take the tests out of me.,10
No coach will say Saha hasn’t batted for more than a year and hence it is acceptable.,2
Can't believe Saha has a hundred in an IPL final,7
Nabi is ballsy af. almost singlehandedly defeated India during cwc 19,7
"That's the way they should have started hitting in 16th over, so many wickets in hand ffs",8
"what now?? if KKR finish good now, are we happy with DK as captain or Eoin is the best",1
Mavi improving by leaps & bounds,2
Not a ball? Or warning? It's over the head know?,2
Such a big brain move sending Saha at 4,2
Afghanistan is still considered one of the weaker sides or minnows. How do they produce top class spinners and pinch hitters? Fascinating. I hope they do well in the future,5
Who tf is the commentator! Doesn’t even stop blabbing shit during the bowls,1
Kaunsa lodu team saha ko IPL century banane diya tha?,9
Saha to hit a hattrick of 6s now,5
Mavi will definitely make it to the indian team,1
This SRH lost to RCB so I'm not surprised,9
[deleted],3
Saha this mofo,3
Mavi should have bowled more,2
Get 7 singles in 7 balls and end this shitshow.,9
The fuck was that Nagarkoti? Could give Hrithik a run for his money.,3
"Please end this misery of me, I want to kill myself watching Saha",4
"30 in 30 balls, player of the match to KKR batsman Saha",5
SRH just crossed CSK's score. Moral victory guys!,7
Saha SR watch 100.00,2
Gentle reminder that Saha has a 25 ball century in club cricket,4
Worst innings ever in IPL,5
This is one of the worst t20 innings ever by saha,7
So this is what feels like to be at the other end. Good bowling from KKR.,4
"Man, I take it back, even Shankar is better than Saha lmao",13
"Binga saying whats the best option for Shah here? 

Is it 1 or a dot ball?? 

Savage level 100",4
Jesus it is getting cringy to watch Saha flail his bat and hit only air,5
"Ladt over coming. Saha had changed bats, will refuse singles and will score 25 runs like all wicketkeeper batsmen",6
How have these cluster fucks not been all out yet is still a mystery to me,7
Just fuck offf,5
"Feel for SRH fans, He's there to collect paychecks 😭😂",4
They're bowling wide for Saaha,5
Bas bahut hua. ab aur nahi saha jaata,3
Middle order weak af.,3
U just wasted 5 overs of innings,6
scenes if they can't even chase this,6
One of the most boring innings I have seen this IPL except that Cummins spell,4
Lol bowlers must hate it when a dude who's chewing gum causally hits a shot,3
SRH batting reminds me of the grand Prix at Sochi - sterile.,3
Damn Saha has really sucked the air out this SRH innings!,2
Good last over Mavi..and shit batting Saha,2
Abhishek Sharma would've player better than this uncle.,1
"3 swings and misses this over. Proper tailenders.

\*Make that 4",4
"Such dogshit batting by Saha, it hurts my eyes",5
Umpire was like fuck off I never want to see this shit bat again,11
They just planned to bowl wide for Saha,3
Oh my god,3
"Wasn't that a wide ?

I didn't see it clearly",2
Mavi has impressed. Kkr have sorted out their death bowling.,1
At least SRH did not lose all ten wickets this game.,3
Shit umpiring again,3
That's a wide,2
That was wide!!,2
What is SRH doing?!,1
Can Nabi stay at the crease for the last over,2
Saha training to be the next MS without the sixes at the end.,3
KKR will smash this target in 14 overs,1
The good old 90s slower deliveries,1
clear wide wow,2
The umpire wanted to end this shit show....not surprised,4
Not having Moody is a big bummer.,2
"31 balls 30 runs, Saha benchod. He should sit in the next match.",2
"Don't let Saha finish with a 100+ strike rate, KKR. It'll be an insult for the entire batting community if he does.",3
That was wide lmao,2
Nice looking stadium,2
Everyone knew Saha at Middle order is disaster how didn't SRH Management see that,2
Fuck you too Saha,2
Another shitty cal from the umpire .,4
LMAO even the umpire is tired of seeing Saha hit and miss,6
They brought in Saha to stop the collapse. He has spectacularly outperformed in his duties.,4
4 dots in 19th over. Can't decide if Mavi is exceptional or SRH is dogshit,7
Umpires are so inconsistent with wides this year.,3
"I am guessing that there would be heavy competition between CSK, RCB and SRH for the last spot.",4
Bowl Nagarkoti you coward,2
that was wide wtf,5
"That was wide.Indian umpires are shit, all products of nepotism.",2
"What's the lowest IPL score for only 3 wickets lost? This has to be close, right?",3
Guys can someone please explain why Mavi only bowled two even though he was their one of their best bowlers last match? Tuned in late😔,3
Somebody has to do a Stoinis/ Archer here.,2
Umpire lost his GPS signal there for a moment,2
Is this 2013 seeing Murali Vijay and Saha in T20s hurt my heart,5
That's how you do it Saha,4
"That's how you hit boundaries, cunt Saha lookm eat something and try to hit.",2
Shah = Murali Vijay + Dhoni before last over,2
Saha better be a Superman and catch and save all the balls which might cross the boundary for his redemption arc.,4
"Perfect match for Gill ,take your time and play his normal game ,unless russel gets hit around the park",2
Watching SRH bat gives me hope for CSK.,2
"Shit umps man! They give non-wides wides, and don't call actual wides :(",6
Nabi better keep the strike man,3
Praise the fucking lord!,1
Lmao thats how you fucking hit it Saha,1
"I gave up hope for this season, at least during the next season auctions, we'll build a good middle order and have some power hitters at lower order.",7
Saha ran himself out.,1
"Wriddhiman ""30* (31)"" Saha",3
Rashid - Nabi 8 overs crucial don't see anyone elese winning it for SRH,1
Wide balls incoming,1
Umpire is also bored of this shit batting.. wanna get them out their misery,1
Sacrificed,2
What is this weird fetish of giving everyone game time. This was Nagarkotti's over!,1
beautiful shot,1
Should have done this a long time ago,2
Wow director has absolutely missed that haha,1
You could have done that sacrifice 3 overs ago. Fuck off,7
Wtf happened?,2
"Blessing in disguise, hopefully we see Rashid",4
He just wanted to get out. Good Guy Saha.,7
KKR will get their nrr back to positive after this match,3
Dude Manish pandey should've done that far before,6
Ffs srh you guys are playoffs permanent,3
This is pretty embarrassing from Saha. Hope he doesn't get picked again this season. He's never really been a T20 player.,2
Saha should have done that a long time ago. smh,5
Frustrating as F,1
"Umpire socha iss betichod se kuch nahi padna, wide dene ka koi poimt nahi",6
What was that innings,3
Umpire trolling srh fans too hahaha,2
Show the runout you idiots,1
What hapoened,1
Damn finally out,1
"If you have played 31 balls in a T20 game, you'd expect a minimum of 42 runs?",3
"Just tuned in.

Someone explain how SRH are just 3 down but only at 139?",6
"Though it's nabis fault partially , ahppy Saha got out",6
Why didn't they put Nabi in earlier?,2
Saha should've got himself out long ago.,5
"Nabi should just keep Saha at the non-striker as if he's a tailender

Edit: LMAO how the fuck did he got run out there? Not complaining.",4
Couple of overs too late that,5
"Saha knew Nabi had to take strike, atleast he knows what's important for the team",6
"Shit. Saha out!!!  
Now Rashid will hit sixes!!! 😫",7
KKR fucked up here,8
What camerawork is this lmao,5
Srh made sure not to collapse by not hitting at all . Genius!,3
[removed],4
Smart move by Saha. Should've done this 5 overs earlier though.,9
"Bairstow, Warner, Pandey, Nabi, Abhishek, Rashid, 


This should be their batting order. Certainly I know more than WC winning coach. Common sense Bayliss 😭",6
"Russ has bowled 8 balls, looks like he's bowled 8 overs on the trot.",3
Poor from Karthik. He should have let Saha bet. No point running KKR's best player out.,11
Someone please tell Saha that saving wickets makes no difference to the NRR!,3
What a shit show by saha,9
"Saha gone, big blow to KKR",8
Excellent camera work there on the runout.,4
Thank you nabi,2
"Camera man was perving on cumdog, cheeky",3
Other players ignore Saha completely,7
no fist bumps for you saha. about right,3
Why is no one clapping for Saha in the SRH dugout ? Lmao..,4
"Cummins looked upset , their best batsman was out.",4
TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK,4
Atleast he got out trying to get Nabi on strike,3
SRH better take early wickets if they want to keep this stupid run rate,1
Should limit Saha to play till 15th over unless 5 wickets down,2
Do you guys think all crowd noises have been fake the whole time,3
"Saha has been so shit, they didn't even think it was important to show him getting run out!!

Lol",5
Honestly this was a bit embarrassing. Feels for Saha's fans and family,3
Dk i thought you were a smart captain. What is this??,2
Awesome innings saha,1
That innings has possibly costed SRH the game. Unless the web of Nabi and Rashid can choke KKR.,3
Ain't Ganguly endorsing the betting app conflict of interest ?,4
"**19.2** Russell to Mohammad Nabi, 1 run, OUT, **Saha run out at the striker's end.** Full ball outside off, Nabi mistimes the drive, along the floor to long-off. Saha wants the second but is sent back. Puts in a dive but he won't make it. A forgettable innings for him, couldn't get anything away tonight **138-4**

WP Saha run out (Cummins/&dagger;Karthik) 30 (31b 1x4 1x6) SR: 96.77",2
Tactical mistake by KKR,3
"Btw whose keeping for SRH, Bairstow or Saha?",1
"Bazz should be disappointed, Saha gone",6
Still no rashid,1
Few seasons back rcb csk and srh fought for the top spot now they fight for the wooden spoon DD and RR fought for the wooden spoon and now fighting for the top spot .....how the times have changed,5
Such a sad display of batting,1
"Saha ke atyachaar se tumhe se ek hi aadmi bacha sakta hai, khud saha",3
"If you're telling me that Saha is gonna face 1/4 of the total of 20 overs, as the opposition captain I'm all in. I know he got a hundred n all, but that was quite some time back, and in Chinnaswamy.",5
BMac on walkie talkie : cunted,2
Nabi gives 0 fucks,2
Why not Rashid,2
Dick beamer incoming,3
Can someone explain why no sri lankan players are playing in the last two ipls,5
"Saha made M Vijay & MS proud, played 31 balls and strike rate less than 100. 👌",3
they really didn’t bring in my favourite 19 year old...,4
Lol Nabi gave no fucks,4
Saha's innings was painful to watch.,2
"Why not rashid khan here? 

Lot more experienced",2
Surely you send Rashid here or m I missing something?,3
I'm starting to think teams are buying players off-auction to plant them in other teams,4
"SRH batting is so woeful that their number 4 and 5 batsmen are batting like tailenders. Saha at 30 runs for 30 balls with 7 wickets in hand. Sad.

Unpopular opinion: Kane has to play for these guys. Pandey at 4. 

You can’t be batting like 90s tailenders when your openers get out.",5
DK is probably thinking he shouldn't have done that lol,3
DuPlessis would have run Saha out long long ago...,7
good thing nabi isn't on strike,1
Why is KKR playing with 6 specialist bowlers?,3
Great audition by Saha for Test keeper.,9
Nabi- get wrecked saha,3
Wtf wrong with this management.. Sent Saha ahead of Nabi/Garg and now Abhishek ahead of Rashid.,10
Nabi should have been sent earlier. He would have ran Saha out.,9
Saha out after playing an instrumental knock for KKR,9
BRING RASHID YOU THICK MOTHER FUCKERS YOU NEED A PINCH HITTER!!,13
They didn't add a run for the runout? They already ran one,0
I remember in 2018 SRH were winning defending any totals under 140 and losing all games defending over 150,6
The pickup on the run from nagarkoti was amazing,3
Poor from Nabi. He should take strike than taking 2 .,4
Shit show,5
Not a single player cheered Saha on as he walked back. He must be gutted. Yikes!,41
Saha played a contender for one of the worst innings this season,28
Only thing that can help help SRH now is kkr batting itself,13
Still they reached 140 not bad can defend it.,8
And here I was thinking no team can be more boring than CSK,6
Pitiful. That's it.,6
How do you miss aiming at 3 stumps from 4 steps away lol,4
"DK fast, that was experience",2
Great bowling by KKR,1
"Saha was going to hit 4 sixes in a row if the single was taken. It'll have to stay in his pocket-- that crumpled piece of paper that says ""r/cricket talk naah""",12
"Not a KKR fan, but I will be surprised if KKR don't win the IPL with this team. It's a solid all round team.",4
Kickass bowling by KKKR,2
Kolkata looking superbly balanced if they nail their batting lineup,1
"Doesn't matter which team he plays for, you can't just take the Bengali out of Saha.",5
Are we going back to the whole defending low totals thing?,3
Russell tried an offcutter throw,1
What a shitty innings really. To have 6 wickets left and score only 140 lol,2
Send Rashid as an opener and Bairstow one down. Just do it as an experiment,2
*2015-16 flashbacks*,2
SRH clearly exceeded expectations. This Sub is saying 140,4
"I will never tire of the feeling of child like joy in Harshas voice when he's talking about cricket, dude just loves it",4
DK needs to improve his over rate,3
"6 wickets in the shed and scoring just 140 odd is criminal.

43 runs off the last 5 overs with 8 wickets in hand. Oof!",8
Saha made us believe that Dhoni is the better keeper-batsman.,6
"Imagine being so shit that despite losing just 4 wickets, you score just 142 .... Like, you are not even CSK",19
"Ab kya wicket gaand mein daloge bc

t- will you shove leftover wickets up you ass",5
Saha be like : mujhse Saha nahi jara,5
This is the old SRH that I know. Our bowling always shows up on such occasions.,6
KKR and DC gonna light up this IPL. MI will still win tho,2
"If this was RCB, they'd have the good sense to lose ALL of their wickets trying to get this shit score.",6
Bmac writes a lot in his notebook and Abishek will try and sneak glance and write something in his notebook,2
I am confused. Is it great bowling or shitty batting?,3
Priyam garg being the Nikhil Naik of SRH here,2
Why not open with Warner and Rashid Khan to get the innings off to a quicker start and Bairstow at #4?,2
Problem with CSK and Sunrisers is that both teams seem designed to do well on slow spinners / flat roads with short boundaries in the subcontinent.,4
Don't know how many times Rashid has to prove he can slog. Brain dead SRH management.,11
"

**SRH defending below 150 targets vs KKR**

Won : 0
Lost : 3",5
SRH has a great bowling lineup. Shubman gills role will be crucial today.,5
"Cummins back in form, best news for kkr",7
This is like the perfect target for a player like Gill. Hopefully he delivers today.,6
"Nagarkoti looks are like one of those newly minted nepo kids from the bollywood factory. Less height , more built, very model-ish kinda looks. 
(Obligatory not gay comment )",-5
Love how SRH sending shit batsmen is bad management but CSK sending shit batsmen is bad captaincy,3
either this is a terrible wicket to bat on or srh blew this pretty bad.,6
Why did kooldeep only bowl 2?,1
Not showing intent is becoming a real thing now... scoring 142 for the loss of 4 wickets is really underwhelming,8
Russel and narine could finish this in 6 overs if they wanted to,6
Looks like Saha will be nuked to Oblivion for the rest of the season after that shitshow,12
"I don't even think bowling is our strength...I don't know how we'll do against Pandya, Rahul, and Pant.",7
These match-ups don't deserve weekend billing. Either that or make them play at Sharjah instead. Dafuq did we just watch?!,15
"Batsman scoring 1 - Crowd: AAAHHsAAHShsAHSAAAaaaaAAAAAA

Batsman scoring 6 - Crowd: ......

Bowler starts to bowl another ball - Crowd: ?????!!AAAAaaaAAAAaaAAA

crowd.exe stopped working.",8
200 iq thinking from srh to send in Saha at no.4,7
Saha must be good at test cricket,5
Saha will get jumped in the showers lmao,13
Imagine how the team that let Saha score a hundred in the IPL finals feels,23
"Nagarkoti and Mavi apart from being really quick seem to have to bullet arms, good for the future.",6
"Srh batting order should be:

Warner,Bairstow,Pandey,Nabi,Garg,Rashid, Sharma",5
Seriously. What was the purpose of sending Saha in that position? He was struggling. Literally no time was left for Abhishek and Nabi to push the runrate. Disappointed.,3
"Interesting strategy from both sides.

One bowling injury-prone allrounder when bowlers have many overs remaining.

Other not trying to hit much despite wickets remaining.",2
Lux Cozi banyaans,0
"I don't know if this is irritation of Saha's innings speaking,  but I genuinely think the umpiring has been piss poor. I am not generally one to complain, but the nonchalant incompetence has gotten on my nerves. 

I legit think Pandey shouldn't be out. He was on his toes and has high tucked his shirt. From my knowledge the ball should be below waist height in a normal batting stance. 

Also the clear cut wides which were not given.",6
"**Top 3 Test Innings of last few years**

Kusal Perera's 153 Vs SA at Dubran.

Ben Stokes' 135 Vs Australia at Leeds.

**Wriddhiman Saha's 30(31) Vs KKR, Abu Dhabi** 😂",11
Narine going to smash SRH's medium pace attack.,3
Varun seems like a really nice guy.,3
Why does SRH management keep hopes on failed batsmen? Send Nabi Rashid higher in the order you idiots,12
"Excellent cricket by KKR. Great performances for them by 
Pat Cummins, Varun Chakravarthy and Wriddhiman Saha.",5
I miss Tom Moody,7
Abhishek Nayar and McCullum were playing name place animal thing all along,12
"It is not Saha's fault completely. Management is responsible for sending him above the likes of Nabi, Abhishek, Priyam and Rashid khan.",1
"Sunrisers seem to have 3 worldies, and then absolutely nothing else",5
Why aren't they calling wides? Did they change the rules?,2
He an architect? Wow!,2
"Jeez when you are really struggling, you throw your wicket it's okay. Don't drag your team in",0
Dugout gonna scratch the bottom of the barrel for top moments in this innings.,3
"Missed most of his overs, how was Nagarkoti?",1
Oh its a game of chess where both the players are going for a stalemate,1
Is there any other Cricket team whose bowling is more exiting than batting?,-1
Honestly one of the most boring T20 innings I’ve seen. Disaster,23
"The pitch looks like it has something for the spinners, and is sticky with the faster bowlers. And KKR doesn't exactly have the strongest batting lineup. So although I feel Hyderabad fell 20 runs short of a desirable target. Will be interesting if Bhuvi takes a couple of wickets early on.",2
"Other teams after 3 down
Pandya ,pollard , pant , russel ,Abdev

Srh- saha
Csk- kedar",13
"Wait, is Tom Moody not the SRH coach anymore?",2
So much talk on RCB being dependant on 2-3 players but I think it's easier to make a list of teams which aren't dependent on a couple of players,1
Lol the best part of that last over was Nabi giving 0 fucks with respect Saha's runout. No reaction at all.,7
Listen all you Kane fans... who would you play him ahead of? Warner? Bairstow? The other 2 are in the team more for their bowling.,0
SRH fans: Does anyone know why Tom Moody's contract wasn't renewed or did Moody want to leave himself,7
Who are the Indian spinners for srh?,4
Only 21L/2.1 million on the hotstar stream that too over the weekend. Weird,4
CSK vs SRH would be Stoppable Force vs Movable Object,7
U know the quality of batting reserves when u have two field two wicketkeeper batsman,2
Saha should come after Nabi and Rashid,6
Vijay Shankar is useful because he can play with a good strike rate. He would have made 15-20 runs more in Saba’s place. I know he hasn’t put up strong performances but can muscle the bowl well.,4
I can't look at Brett Lee without thinking about Dean Jones.,7
"Playoffs:

kxip, DC, Mi, RR 

offchance: SRH",-2
"All other teams: Will give chances to young inexperienced players in between the experienced ones
SRH: let's ruin ourselves by giving infinite chances to inexperienced ones and warming the bench with stars",4
"Saha used to be so versatile while playing for us. I remember him going for boundaries as well as paying as anchor, whatever the situation demanded.",2
[deleted],3
MSK prasad has most punchable face !,-1
I like how suddenly KKR's batting line up is considered weak after all that hype,2
"MI after losing 3 wickets - Pollard, Hardik, Krunal

SRH after losing 2 wickets - Saha",11
"Srh only hope from here is Rashid Khan

But we got Morgan",2

Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha",7
Good captaincy from my main man Dk,2
Reaaaaally want that 2018 bowling that we did against MI rn,3
We might have collapsed to 120 all out instead of scoring 140 but we would have entertained the neutrals by losing all 10 wickets unlike SRH did.,7
"KKR, do not rate your bowling based on this game. Just a friendly suggestion.",10
If srh defends like the old times I will probably commit a war crime,7
I think they are massively below par score,3
Open with Narine and Russell. Cummins and Morgan next. Rest all can follow. Kill the game in first 10 overs,-5
"Top minds in the comments:

“Haha SRH sent in Saha. MI would have sent Krunal, Hardik or Pollard”

Saha came at 2 down in the 9th over.",25
Shit captaincy to send Saha at 4,5
"Warner
Bairstow
Pandey
Shankar
Kane

SRH has chance if they use this top5",13
"Saha came at right time, to save the wickets but he should have left on right time too, to  let the wickets he saved do something.",7
"WWWriddhiman Saha is right up there with Valthaty, Rahul Sharma, Sran or Bisla. He isnt just a t20 legend but a decent enough part time wicketkeeper, who can bat. He carried the whole ICL team after Rayudu left. What sets him apart from other players is he absolutely demolishes the batting attack. There is no rhythm to his destruction, he dosent care about being stylish or tries to go out of his ways. He plays by his strengths and that's what's allowed him to play for so long. Another thing that I genuinely like about him is how he enjoys the game. It dosent matter if he wins or loses, he's always smiling, dancing and makes you realise at the end of it the sport is just about enjoying yourself and being in the moment, fuck catches or stumpings! I genuinely thought he was done for after he was axed by the Sidemen but he's still going strong. It's a shame he isnt playing in the 100. No matter his form, he is one of the biggest crowd attractions and genuinely one of the most meatloaf evoking players on the planet.",2
KKR should look to score runs and SRH should look to take wickets.,8
"If Saha's batting was so bad, why is he wearing the orange cap then? /s",15
plz make the chase interesting. either kkr chases this down in 12 overs or srh get them 49 all out. make it close!,7
"Saha doesn't get to play test cricket outside India, so he decided to it in this IPL game.",2
SRH might as well get Amla Pujara and Dravid as their pitch hitters,7
Just watched the replay of Saha's runout. Warner didn't even make eye contact with him as Saha walked back to the dugout.,5
"Every Bowler interviewed after their side's bowling innings: ""I think we can chase it. It's hot out there, hard to grip the ball, the pitch is really good basically a road, the field is slippery and hard, dew is coming down pretty hard, there are poison ivys growing down at fine-leg area you have to watch out for. yeah, tough for the fielding side. We chase this eassyy""",5

Maybe closing eyes, god only knws.i respect all nationality ,i dont have any complain or problem, but icc really unfair and biased action against sakib. Some country plaeyer do ball tempering and not receive ban. Please icc bangla fans really harted by harsh decision",0
"Bad call by Management to have sent Pandey instead of Saha. Saha can at least pull runs in the powerplay and get out in the middle overs. However, I think playing him as a replacement for Shankar was still appropriate.",3

"If narine survives bhuvi, the game will finish pretty early",0
"Before anyone shits on SRH, they made more than CSK yesterday.",4
Narine is too lazy,1
"While I still think that we'll get dragged to the playoffs by Warner, I honestly do not feel confident at all about any aspect of our team this season. Only Warner and Bairstow are realiable with the bat, the pace bowling is extremely one-dimensional with almost everyone being a swing bowler and literally zero outright fast bowlers, Rashid has lost a lot of his lustre.",7
"Am I wrong in saying Bairstow upsets the balance of srh. Maybe Saha with warner, tell Saha to start hitting in powerplay. Manish at 3, Williamson at 4, shankar at 5, Nabi, Abhishek, Priyam order depending on the situation. After that Rashid Khan. It seems way more balanced.",36
"I don't understand why some of ya'll think SRH released Dhawan. [He asked for more $$ but due to some capping rules, SRH couldn't do that](https://twitter.com/SunRisers/status/1059363002539958272?s=20)",14

"India really has some quality young cricketers coming through the system, damn.",7
Calm down commentators it's just Naraine lol,9
Khaleel is high-key gorgeous tbh.,3
PASSION from Warner and Khaleel,3
6 bowler ploy gonna backfire??,6
SRH Defence^(TM),3
Lol calm down Warner you got rid of a bowler,7
Classic srh squeeze incoming?,2
"Can bairstow become a finisher  to give some firepower to middle order.

Is it bad idea?",1
Narine opening just wont work with these grounds,1
The bot having rcb flair is kinda hilarious,3
Chill its just narine the pinch hitter,3
If Sunil can't score against this attack then need to go back to lower order,2
"Said it at the start. Doesn't matter if you pick seven bowling options or eight bowling options, if you don't figure out your batting order, you're gonna have a bad time.",0
lmao kkr are only playing 6 batsmen,0
This Aamir Khan robot Ad is genuinely bad and very disturbing,3
Actually love Warners captaincy energy,3
Al-Khaleeli 👌👌👌,0
"Narine as a batsman is done deal!!

He isn't going to make runs in IPL now.",5
"Lets see our managements mindset

With who comes next",2
"""Dangerous Sunil Narine"" who can't play short ball to save his life.",8
I hope we won't be admitting later Saha played a crucial knock,8
Lol just another one of those 99 matches where Narine gets out without making an impact.,5
Can we pls open with Tripathi and Gill?,5
"I remember Bhuvi got Narine early in the innings in 2017, and Bhuvi just stood there expressionless. Didn't want to celebrate because Narine is a tailender.",10
I really want to know what McCullum is writing,2
"Open with Morgan, sack Narine as opener",5
Cummins economy of 4.75 with 11 dot balls is filthy. Good comeback from last game.,5
Rana..when is your birthday ? I want to send a card.,1
Pat Cummins is a better pinch hitter than Narine.,7
"Other teams: Send in our best openers.

KKR: What if one of our openers is a bowler who was successful some years ago but now is just a walking wicket?",9
Duck for deuce,0
Khaleel Starc,3
Great start for SRH..Narine has been figured out by everyone,4
Lmao imagine if KKR pull a CSK out here,4
"Rana and Gill batting together. Must be awkward after that ugly incident.

Edit: When the umpire reversed Gill's dismissal after his protests in a Ranji match.",6
"Gautam Gambhir invented the Sunil Narine opening ploy when he used to play good and it was fucking Gambhir coming at number 3, one of the best no. 3 of all teams combined. 


Why is KKR still sticking to it??",9
Fuck that's six,2
Gill Kill!,7
Who came in at Number 3?,1
Remember last year when we were almost winning with 53 off 19 for Kolkata and Russell really rampaged to win with 4 balls to spare?,9
Gorgeous,2
Gill Monster,2
Need to bring in Tripathi for one of the bowlers he's one of the best powerplay players.,3
Future of Indian cricket is bright,5
"You got Narine, Khaleel. Not Bradman. Tone it down lmao",8
What was that shot!,2
Gilly bhai is so good,2
Young 2007 Rohit Sharma vibes from that shot,2
Why is Morgan coming in at 5. Especially when he does so well at 4.,3
Superhuman Gill,1
"My biggest pet peeve in cricket is the phrase “southpaw” 

I don’t know why I just really hate hearing it, where does the phrase even come from",3
"Tripathi in for Narine, Lockie Ferguson added as fourth overseas. 

You're welcome.",2
"Gill tryna give me orgasms

Edged 2nd time",2
"LOL Narine is a nobody. Poor guy is going to be pushed into retirement after this IPL. And daddy Ashwin is going to lead India to the no.1 Test Ranking for a long time by taking 600+ wickets and averaging 35+ with the bat! Ashwin wins the long game, Narine can enjoy his last 12 months of being relevant! 😂",-8
Narine shouldn't be an opener at all with this team .,3
This bowling attack is best for young domestic batsmen to get in form as they face them everywhere,7
gills batting is so sexy,7
How many people have their favourite team tag along their name....how to get one?,5
"Gill has no Chill pill. If SRH doesn't get him out early, win the match he will.

- Inspired by Sir Akash Chopra and Legend Siddhu",7
Go Bobbie one more,3
Khaleel expelled from Dinda academy with immediate effect. Wicket in first over is an irrevocable level 4 violation which cannot be challenged. The academy prides itself in taking strict actions against those who try to tarnish the reputation of the academy.,18
What a way to start your IPL,2
Cummins should open with Gill.,8
Umm Bhuvi's age is showing on his face. Thats a first.,11
No worries boys. Gill is done with his quota of playing those good lookin shots. Throwing his wicket aways soon with one of those half jab pull.,3
Only express pace bowler are performing well in UAE so no hope for SRH,2
Khaleel is an rcb product. Anything less than 40 runs will be a disgrace 😔,15
Looks like the match is gone bois.,12
"Do you folks r/cricket think Narine should open? 

Me: not a big fan of losing quick wickets for a few runs—he can do the same job after 15th over. Sure KKR has good middle order but by that time you have given opposition some energy with th wickets",6
Yeah we're losing 2 off 2,7
wow Gill has already played almost 30 IPL games.,7
does Bhuvi even have a bouncer,1
"Irfan, Bhuvi -- lost the magic going for the speed :(",10
Great shot Nitish,3
If SRH loses it will be beacuse of saah . He  was just slowing game,2
Bhuvi lost his wicket taking ability over last 2 seasons.,3
Re: my comment about “southpaw” - how does a boxing expression end up describing a left handed cricketer?,4
uff Rana is class,9
So KKR has Fergusson too! Insane bowling resources 😲,19
Looks like a chasing team victory after so long,5
Gill has trouble with bouncers,2
"There should be a INDIA XI vs IPL XI T20 series.

IPL XI - 7 Indian players (not playing for national side) + 4 foreign players.",6
As a fast bowler being on top for 5+ years is not easy. Bhuvi of 2013-18 was great. Bumrah of 2016-2020 unplayable. Still I think Bumrah might extend his career 2-3 yrs more atleast at being in Top.,-4
"Sub asking bouncer from bhuvi

He says wish granted",10
"Good on Karthik to send Rana at 3, this is where he should be batting",8
Our season is over if Bhuvi can’t pull through.,36
Naughty naughty 😈,14
Naughty Naughty ball Bhuvaneshwar... LMAO,13
"That noise is directly out of star wars episode 3, those lizard things that obi wan was riding around",11
Rana one of the all time underrated IPL players,6
"Noticeable improvement
 in Sanjay Bangar's commentary, comparing from the start of IPL",3
Man that over sucked,11
Warner is a gun in the field,2
That late no ball calling is going to cause some controversies,2
Why are people down on Bhuvi already? Wasn't he great in the death last game?,10
Gill can replace Kohli in the upcoming years..he has so much talent and good looks.,7
"If thats the siren for a no-ball, I wonder what the siren for a fire alarm would be.",11
"1 2 ka 4! 4 2 ka 1!

I haven't heard this in 30 years or something",5
Is the dj guy retarded? I mean he has one job to play the audience sound on a boundary or a wicket and he's been playing it on singles,7
wow they playing ram lakhan songs. what even....,6
"Since this has obviously got more interesting than the match, here is the etymology of the word southpaw which originates from baseball:

>from the practice in baseball of arranging the diamond with the batter facing east to avoid the afternoon sun. A left-handed pitcher facing west would therefore have his pitching arm toward the south of the diamond",3
"KKR doctored the pitch at the interval but it doesn't really matter, This SRH team is completely hapless and would struggle to play decent bowling even if the pitch were a cement road. This is gonna turn into a serious humiliation which will leave lasting scars on the SRH team. Im calling it now SRH will get bowled out for under 100 in next match just watch. The fact that players like Priyam Garg is in the team shows how far SRH have fallen. People should stop viewing SRH as a top tier franchise they're now in the league of Delhi/Punjab. Its the end of an Era, SRH cricket is never going to be the same as they once were.",2
Need more yorkers from Bhuvi. A lot more. Hate to say it but he can’t bowl even half as good as his previous form without more yorkers in his arsenal.,2
Unfortunate!,4
This is a mockery.,10
How the hell does Khaleel Ahmed still have a career left?,1
This game is gonna be over in less balls than Saha faced,10
rinku bhaiyya humming to the song,4
Why bowl there when u don't have a fielder there,1
Is KKR batting on the same pitch?,9
Pleb bowling,2
Okay so we already know who's ending at the bottom of the table,9
"Right, I have given up the slight bit of hope I had left",9
"Rana ji mujhko maaf karna

Water has more flavour than Khaleel,13
"The way Hyderabad has been playing, they might lose to an associate nation",11
Real khaleel is back,6
Khaleel deserves to be in RCB. IDK what he's doing in SRH.,9
Rana for Team India,2
Khalol thought he was hot shit getting a tailender's wicket. Rana putting him in his place,7
R kkr tryna chase 195 from last game?,6
Could have been 4 also,3
greatest wicket keeper smh,0
Give SRH the wooden spoon already.,2
You can clearly see McCullum effect in KKR today. Berserk start,3
"Yeah Saha, more of that Shithousery please.",0
Khel Khatam Dukaan Band,4
Lmao Danny Morrison describing Shubhman Gill when Rana hit that shot is all the proof that he's here just for his Bakchodi and not his cricket knowledge,7
Nitish Rana could/should be a middle order option for India,2
Natarajan is a better bowler than khaleel if you have good bowler use them......atleast they can win you matches cuz your batting ain't doing shit,2
I don’t expect much from Nabi and Rashid. Spinners aren’t doing as well as expected.,3
"Danny, that's Nitish.",3
SRH desperately need Kanos this season. Where is he?,14
Khaleel is a poor mans unadkant who is a poor mans mustafizur,24
Rana over Kedar anyday!,7
Wow this commentator wants to get that giraffe Stanlake in the side over Kane.,4
"Discount Zaheer Khan, was right about this",8
Is this hell? It feels like it,5
Rana is trying to score more fours than the entire SRH team.,11
[deleted],2
They need to drop Bairstow to 5. Let Saha play at the top in powerplay. Let him get out after that.,9
So much for the best bowling side,4
sky and rana are the best uncapped indian players,14
"I suppose we've had a shit middle order since 2018, it's showing it's ugly side, now that bowlers aren't as effective.",10
On other days Saha would have caught that.,0
Yes. Khaleel never disappoints.,3
Saha should have a chat with both the batsman in middle. Get them to settle down and hold their ends. This is not the correct temperament for these conditions.,9
"Am I the only one who thinks David Warner may not be the best choice as your captain?

Not just because of the cheating thing, which should probably disqualify him from ever being captain again, but he doesn't really strike me as a tactical genius either.",-1
"What happened to Amla the IPL player? He batted just 16 times, but averaged 44+ and striked at almost 142. Those are numbers comparable to Warner himself (Avg 43, SR 142).",4
"Who in world cricket has/had the weirdest batting stances?

Bailey, Jack Russell, Chanderpaul comes to mind.",2
"If Steyn can be taken, why can’t the likes of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson be considered?",0
foakes would've caught that,4
Dang Gill. Learning from mistakes.,2
"From remember the name to handsomely, remember, handsomely rewarded commentary. IPL really does a number on everyone.",3
Khaleel would have never played for India if he wasn't a left handed pacer,7
RCB Khaleel back in form. Welcome!,3
Gill is so asthetitc,3
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bagCFX_Guw  

 
A chant that I routinely take comfort from as a Spurs fan. Looks like I should appropriate it for SRH use as well",6
"It's KKRs second match and people are already going ""Narine is struggling this tournament"" ""Narine should be replaced"" Lmao",8
Discount Khaleel replaces Khaleel,8
"K Ahmed took 7 wickets in the powerplay overs in the 2019 IPL season, the most by any SRH  bowler. 

114 balls 7 wickets  E.R 8.76

Bhuvi 180 balls 3 wickets  E.R 6.17",5
UAE just ain’t our spot if spinners can’t perform.,3
"Rana again looking in magical touch early in the tournament 

But i wont be surprised he gradually loses his form again as he goes into the tournament 

Different year same story",6
Niqqa salman khan filled 4 half liter glasses with 1 1.2 liter bottle of bebsi,13
I am surprised by SRH stock of medium quality fast bowlers,9
Wasnt Thankarasu Natarajan the guy for whom KXIP paid a lot of money in 2018 auction?,4
Fucking crowd getting excited for nothing.,10
Before this season- people actually liked srh. Despite the middle order debacle- people had a soft spot for the team. Kanos was there and everything was dandy even if we didn’t win the titles often. I guess that era ends this season.,25
Rana and SKY - these two have been quite consistent in past couple of seasons. Should get to play for India,6
Natarajan is more fearless in bowling yorkers than Bhuvi. That’s both good and bad.,5
The T in T Natrajan stands for Yorker,15
Natarajan is more fearless in bowling yorkers than Bhuvi. That’s both good and bad.,18

Yes natty,6
"Fucking something, good length bowling Natrajan",17

nicely done by natrajan!,3
"Power balance in IPL is shifting northwards. DC, KXIP, KKR, RR have become strong teams.

That's why Saha wasn't taking risks early in the innings. Watch and learn Rana ji,-1
Boss DK in,5
"Just curious, does anyone know how IPL salary for players works? Will there be taxes and bonuses?",1
Have they assigned Gambhir's 2015-17 role (i.e. hold down one end) to Gill? Makes sense if they did. Others can go crazy around him.,3
why is DK crying lmao,5
WTF SEND MORGAN YOU COWARDS,9
Rana did his work of bringing down the required run-rate. Now KKR have the luxury of scoring 6 per over for the next 10 overs,6
"Problem with Rana persists

Looks in supreme form

More often than not just gets out against the flow of the game",4
He actually has a neckbeard,14
Let morgan bat ffs,3
How quick is Natarajan?,1
They need to keep a special Rashid over for Russell. It worked last time they played.,2
Good first ball Natarajanikant,7
The only way we're winning this if the Afghan Bois show up,16
Don't think about NRR now pls,5
"Well bowled, Nattu. Some of those overs, please.",5

There was a chance to get him back in form",3
Havan Karen ge havan Karen ge - dk,1
Tbh I don't remember any match where Nabi didn't perform for us,4
Lure out the overseas players. Another wicket would send Morgan out. Make them face the spinners.,2
Kkr should not freak out here.....they can win this with run a ball,5
DK demoting world cup winning batsman and captain Morgan so he can bat more is the ultimate power move,8
Who is that lady in the comm box. Why is she speaking lot of sense.,2
"Nataraj has bowled well, give Apsara a go next",7
Rana resembles Pjanic,0
So umm ina completely unrelated note....name of the Amazon pay girl pls..,4

You think DK prefers Ramraj innerwear or Lux Cozi?,4
"Anti Deep Dasgupta comments are bs. Suddenly out of nowhere - the guy's being doing good commentary for 20+ years. Also remember reading an English newspaper article rating commentators and he was rated at the top ahead of other good commentators.

NOBODY can beat RCB at Chinnaswamy/UAE/anywhere. Even losing to RCB by less than 100 runs is a major accomplishment. We have a mega auction soon, we are not going to lose. You guys had ur chance, but we are the best team in the world. And we achieve our numero uno ranking.

Wow so I guess the DRS timer is absolutely useless.,8
Silly review,5
Lol... Such a dumb review..,5
As plumb as it gets,3
My takeaway from this IPL so far has been that India really lacks talent in the fast bowling department,3
"Karthik should let Morgan play ahead of him , it will help Morgan get used to the conditions a bit more and will definitely help the team in the later half of the tournament

Plus without doubt Morgan is a better Batsman than karthik",6
That is a selfish and braindead review.,13
Ha dk ! Whatever changes his complete inconsistency with the bat and his restlessness over the years never changes . Please never again bring him near the Indian team .,6
lol he is taking a review with him,6
What a waste. KKR finding new ways to lose this match.,10
And the meme umpiring continues hahaha,2

omg he has such a large helmet,3
"That DRS call was equivalent of ""last attack sir last attack"" in school",2

Morgan vs Rashid,2
"**6.2** Rashid Khan to Karthik, OUT, **big appeal and given!** Karthik doesn't pick the googly. And he doesn't take the review....**oh hang on, the timer seemed to have gone past zero, but he has a review after all.** Wondering if I missed his signal earlier, because this is very odd otherwise. Anyway, he was pushing forward, playing for a corridor line on this length ball. Was caught on the back leg right in front of middle. That takes the top of leg says tracker and...well, they'll lose the review that was taken in bizarre circumstances **53-3**

KD Karthik lbw b Rashid Khan 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
Back to back wouldn't hurt much.,1

"Morgan to Rashid: ""Remember Manchester?""",8
Rashid has a really good googly compared to his leggie.,13
Rashid absolutely murdering them,6
Fuck. Calm down Morgan,3
"Not saying that this match is fixed, but I can wager to say that KKR WILL WIN THIS, my reasoning is Saurav has too much going in BCCI for KKR to go there with 2 lost matches.... I will change my icon to Chennai if they win this match and will support Chennai and SRH for 2 games straight!!  anyone want to double down? Hai Himmat?",-18
Ghatiya umpiring wtf yaar,7
Intent,2
That looked out,5
Smart by Warner and Rashid. Not getting carried away by guts and emotions.,6
Hope KKR don't collapse,1
Watson: Even I wouldn't have reviewed that,1
Should have gone for the review. Why do we need if the goes away. Smh,7
Is it weird that they didn't show the correct replay?,1
Should have reviewed it.,1
Old man Maurgun can't pick permanent 18 year old's deliveries.,0
KKR nai hai tayyar,1
SRK bought umpires haha,2
This is the SRH we all love. Pulling back games with their bowling and defending below par scores.,8
"Its morgan,why didn't you took the review. We have 2 review's. Oh fuck",6
Only Gill has played every bowler confidently today in KKR,3
"Gill playing rashid much better than 2 experienced internationals 

Welcome to ipl folks",8
How many games to win to be confirmed a playoffs spot? 8?,3
Afghan jalebi coming up,6
"Man, I forget how good Rashid is. He really can be an ATG",8
Problem is that there's no one else to support Rashid.,3
Gill to win it for kkr u Heard it here first,5
Single! Crowd goes wild!,10
"Legit question, I'm new to IPL. Is Eoin Morgan good outside of England, cause IK he's a beast there",6
"Khud ko champ samajhte ho,  

toh champ ban ke dikhao  

my11 is ready, aur aapki",7
Hindi commentators can get away with saying anything. Some one just said Morgan is an excellent  player of spin,9
Rashid’s economy in UAE holy shit,14
In which season did SRH defend their total (high and low) almost every time ?,6
Gill looks settled,3
How much for 1 hardik pandya?,1
Nabi is very easy to deal with on paper with his unidimensional bowling. But batsmen for some reason always find it difficult to attack him. Curious.,1
It kinda annoys me that SRH wear orange caps. Things may get confusing if Warner or Bairstow gets in form!,13
tbf that was a fuckin sweet googly,10
"Definition of universal hatred - SRH fans complaining that Karthik shouldn't have been allowed to review because the timer ran out, and KKR fans complaining Karthik shouldn't have been allowed to review since the timer ran out",63
Dive Boobie Dive,9
"Rashid ""22"" but looking 35 with 3 kids and a mortgage",17
Jos will be available tomorrow?,8
[deleted],35
"Just Sweep it, Sweep it, sweep it, sweep it

No one wants to be defeated

Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just sweep it, sweep it

Just sweep it, sweep it

Just sweep it, sweep it

Just sweep it, sweep it",23
Morgan wants us to see Russell batting.,5
soo.....Morgan can't play spin?,1
I want Harsha to say fuck once on air. Please make it happen.,8
"So...why is karthik batting at 4?

Pulling rank as captain? Lmao",2
i want kkr to win this for dk man. man deserves a hug.,4
This the Rashid that was missing in the last match. Holding that wicket line for batsmen trying to sweep him and missing.,6
Bhuvi misjudged that catch because he knew how critical Morgan batting is for SRH victory. Change my mind.,7
Morgan literally seems to get out on every ball he faced till now.,9
How can a 20 year old be so much more sensible than a 34 year old?,6
I've been waiting for almost 2 overs and they still haven't shown the correct replay of that Morgan LBW shout,11
I dont know what Gill told DK that led him to take a stupid review to a plumb lbw. I hope it does not come to bit KKR. I think playing out Rashid khan is key to win it. I think SRH has their noses ahead if they can get into KKR middle order as they have more bowlers than required.,1
WARNER WIPED THR BALL IN HIS POCKET. WARNER WIPED THE BALL IN HIS POCKET. WARRNNNEERRR WIIPPPEEDD THEE BALLL INN HISSS POCOOOCKET,14
Gill is striking close to Saha's sr but nobody's whining now 🤷,-11
How can Morgan remain so chill always!?,5
Englishman Morgan?,7
Read it somewhere that Gill is in a relationship with Sachin's daughter,10
Good move to bring in a slip for Morgan.,2
Finally Morgs,3
What is point of orange and purple caps if you allow them to be uniform colors,12
Wow someone actually played a reverse sweep correctly. 2020 is crazy.,9
The crowd is mad. Cheering dot balls,16
“The Englishman or Morgan?” LMAO,11
"Morgan seems fidgety against Rash, wicket coming.",7
This Morgan I can relate to,5
Remember when Morgan smacked rashid in the World Cup? This is a stark contrast from that. You can tell he is struggling,7
Irish Morg isnt gonna have bad matches back to back,5
Hurling wrists!,2
"Morg starting to unsettle rash

17 sixes loading",10
Morgans reverse sweep > every other thing in existence,11
Ready for the Morgan show,5
"Good bowling Rashid, keep putting pressure",7
Y'all think KKR should further with the nariane strategy?,2
"We’re broke, Graeme",1
My knees keep cracking and popping. I am too young for this shit,12
Really hope Rashid turns out to be a Warne and not a Narine over the years.,4
Gill not taking any chances. Smart.,4
Give Natarajan the bowl. Spare 5 overs of spin for the last 10. Choke them somehow.,3
Eoin Morgan in full flow is one of my favourite sights in cricket,12
Hahahahaha... Swann will make a good car salesman. Fake enthusiasm just to bend you over to shag out your money,3
I HATE THESE FUCKING STRATEGIC TIMEOUTS!!!,7
*two world cup winning players out there*,9
Dude the workers ko bula lo ad chick is kind of cute af,0
"I'd rather drive on flat tyres than ever give a penny to CEAT tyres

Cunts owe me hours of my life",23
"Morgan is good but Somu is not bad either.

Sorry to those who don't understand",4
Who tf calls a baby over as a mini over?,4
What is Shaun Tait upto these days?,3
KKR opted for 1 additional bowler and are thin on batting. Few more break throughs and who knows we might be in for something.,3
I feel Strategic Timeouts are losing their value. They are basically being held off as long as possible and players seem to have a much more better idea of what to do.,1
Get the SRH special *Strange Job™* to initiate.,3
"Uhhh

Anybody know the name of girl in Bumrah's Dream XI ad?",8
Murali the legend,4
Swiggy ads are on point this IPL hahahaha,1
Remember that umpire Suhas Lamkhade from 2009 kxip vs DC game? That guy was a joker.,3
WTF is wrong with KKR having way too many bowlers but not that many batters in their squad. I am not impressed with the backup squad.,5
Swann is drunk,2
Kkr screwed now that murali gave rashid the cheat codes,7
any idea if shiv sundar das still plays cricket?,2
"Anyone know what happened to Paul Valthaty ,the dude who opened for KXIP during Gilchrist's times.",3

"can csk get williamson or something?

[deleted],1
i'm getting 2016 SRH vibes here ngl.,4
Why is Saha in the team if they have Bairstow. I swear to god these foreign players want to do the least work possible,-5
Why not unleash the Big Dick Russel and finish the match now and here?,-1
I only pray to be as hyped up as the virtual fans,9
Morgan looks like he might melt shortly,2
If I would be in one of those fan cams I would probably roast the shit out of the opponent team with my actions,1
I can’t believe nabi has only played 14 games,4
Surely someone from here is in the virtual guestbox?,8
We are just couple wickets away to be on top.,8
And the crowd goes wild *for a regulation single*,14
Sunrisers would be strong contenders for the bottom of the table this season.,6
CSK and SRH are basically trying to outsuck each other right now.. like it’s not a contest to see the better team but rather to see who can be less shit,13
I want Dre Russ to come..,5
"Missed the entire match up til now so my only question is, how the hell do you score just 140 in a t20 match with only 4 lost wickets? That's just pathetic.",8
Unpopular opinion - u shouldn’t have ads after each over if you are having a strategic time out,12
[deleted],8
Nabi is 123% of Akshar Patel right?,2
IPL broadcast coverage is at least 5 or 6 years behind UK  and Aus,2
That slog sweep demonstration is the kind of stuff I love the dugout commentary for.,2
Next ipl we have mega auction right ?,4
"Shubman Gill has decided the current chase would be too easy for russell, he has decided yo make the match interesting by wasting deliveries

Are IPL teams weaker than they used to be, I've not watched it much in recent years but the teams have a lot of nobodies in them now right?

Would it be better to grow to 10 teams and grow to 5 internationals per side?",1
Very bad call. Should have held off Rashid.,2
Those D11 ad actors act way more than required.,3
"Can we have a list of one season wonders? Start with Mustafizur, Markhande",4
Too many U19 stars playing,4
"If you play for franchise A one year and B the other, are you bound by NDA to not reveal secrets of franchise A to B?",2
Oh my Kanos ❤️,6
RRR is slowly but steadily rising,6
Kanos.. A sight for sore eyes.,23
"Oh god, that’s 5 overs of spin in a row.",4
Haven't seen Gill being troubled by Rashid. Even Kohli and ABD looked roughed against him at first,8
Finally we get to hear from Kane.,12
Captain Kane to running water bottles,15
Throw Abhishek Sharma an over too.,6
First and foremost Kane where is your mask?,13
It’s sucks to see Williamson in that blue sack,19
"""Fine, at the moment."" So basically they dropped him.",17
Shot!,1
Gill is poor man Manish Pandey,-2
"Broadcast director: How do we make the crowd more realistic?

Some sadistic fucker: Let's put that vuvuzela noise. Everyone loves that.",6
Kane is like a God to me..,12
Gill should try to hit every ball for six now. Russell will come and finish it for KKR.,3
How's Gill so comfortable here,5
"There is lot of  account which use their real  name as reddit account name.

For some reason I hate it.",5
Kane boying off Danny is muchos funny,3
Oh no! They dropped Kane! I wa such a fool in thinking it was the niggle.,17
Morrison is very interested in Kane's body,8
[removed],-7
"Gill finally giving another orgasm

Had been hard for too long",4
Why is Kane being so cagey,12
Kane in blue is almost criminal,10
mOsT oVERrated pLayer,3
"T Natarajan, Khaleel Ahmed, Siddarth Kaul, Basil Thampi. SRH have such ""there but not quite"" pacers.",6
Even if KKR lose today by thin margin their NRR would drastically improve.,1
Gill hasn't looked bothered by Rashid at all,4
Punjab Mumbai and Delhi are genuinely the only non-shit teams this season. The rest would get rolled over by Bangladesh 9/10 times.,4
Shubman Gill May be young in age but not young in experience. He’s been around the circuit for while. Indian young players play a lot of cricket compared to youngsters here in the carribean,4
Lol Kane being so defensive,3
Wtf is this shithousery. If Kane's available you play him no matter what,22
Lol Kane getting awkward,8
Oh man the interview was cringe max,11
"Kane is too nice to yell ""PUT ME IN FUCKERS"" Danny, smh",24
Criminal when he's fit and he's not in the playing XI. Fuck everything!,21
Kanos 😍😘💋,10
Bring in Abhishek Sharma or Natarajan. Save those Rashid and Nabi overs for Russell,4
"Kanos pretty much admitting the ""injury"" is an excuse",22
He’s kind of a weird guy,1
"Ah damn what an awkward interview,  poor kane doesn't want to throw his team management under the bus and the interviewer is making it so hard for him lmao.",37
I'll take a run a ball and one wicket from Rashid any day .,3
This is a sign of desperation ffs. Don’t keep giving them spin.,4
"the crowd is extremely silent and all of a sudden they all start shouting together, very normal",10
More Kanos.. Yesss,7
Lmao poor kanos.,7
Kane with that Parks and Rec level awkard exit,11
Too many *match thread analysts* shitting on Gill right now.,4
Stop hounding him Danny,8
[deleted],13
I would drop Warner to bring in Kane to give that much need stability in the middle order.,-1
"I wonder why they have to lie about Kane being unfit, they could've just told that he was benched we were all expecting it.",4
Meanwhile Chelsea 3-0 down to West Brom in 28 minutes 😂.,17
Why would you not play one of the best batsman Kane Williamson?,13
Kane seems to be kind of avoiding his injury question. I am wondering whether he was actually injured.,9
"The Narine experiment doesnt seem to be working. The reason it worked with Lynn was Narine would belt spin and Lynn would belt pace. Gill's a good batsman, but he doesnt yet have the hitting ability of Lynn. Could open with Rana and Gill. Keep the right-left combination going with Morgan or DK depending on who gets out.",4
So Kane was dropped not rested?,3
Only one over of YRKFA left. It's slipping away Bois!,3
SRH pretty comfortable right now. I think I'll go sleep,1
"Lol SRH are just getting karma’d for dropping Kane. Our middle order is still terrible, and Nabi isn’t going to fix it.",5
"FFS, they don’t have to target spinners. Don’t waste your key players. They don’t have to worry about the run rate.",4
Kane is not even mad than he's not selected...mann,17
Too many easy singles being given here. Warner is letting this game run away.,4
Give Kane to another team if you don't want to play him srh!,8
KKR can improve their worse than RCB NRR but looks like they just want to win the match.,1
That was a disappointing throw.,3
It's just so sad to Kanos warm the bench. CSK is definitely In need of a player like him.,11
You have the greatest NZ batsmen EVER and you bench him smh,21
What a limp dick throw,9
Bad throw bitch,7
That throw was terrible.,4
at this rate im gonna need an extra cup of coffee to get through this game.,3
"KKR are doing sensible thing, no need to take risk vs Rashid or Nabi. 58 off 51 is nothing with 7 wickets remaining",4
What an awkward interview!,4
"Safe to bet on CSK, KKR and SRH going to be wrecked this season",2
Ultimate Cringe Interview. (UCI),5
"This is going to be a slow boring depressing loss isn't it



Just end me",6
"Glad that's over, so awkward",5
Kaney giving me the sniffles. What a guy,7
"I've already grown up, but I still want to be like Kane when I grow up.",12
can kkr lose from here?,2
Hurts to see kano like this. We desperately need someone like him,1
Wait DK got out already? Lmao,1
[removed],9
Even the interview is as slow and boring as their batting today,8
Good thing they are playing out Rashid And Nabi.,1
Hope Kane recovers from his toe niggle soon xx,1
It's painful to see Kanos on the sidelines but I don't think he can come in place of anyone in this squad.,0
We are clearly 20-30 runs short. The Batsmen have absolutely no reason to be aggressive against Rashid or Nabi.,3
Is upma dosa a regular dish in Andhra? I saw vvs make it on camera once. Looked an unlikely combo.,5
"In all advertisements, KL Rahul comes across as the most sincere boy out there",3
[deleted],5
"Can we just stop with the Youngsters train already , it's in every interview.",6
I know Nabi's great and all but the biggest issue with SRH is their middle order and they definitely need Kanos,4
"Don't want to jinx it, but Gill has played some good quality spin comfortably",5
"SRH need a risk here, bring in somebody else quick and mess with the field a little cause KKR are walking this",1
Ahh the mandatory question on Indian youngsters. Such an idiotic question,8
Does any one understand the cred app ad?,3
"These are much better games to watch, 140-160 scores, 2 evenly matched teams. So far the high scoring games have been largely one sided.",6
"Who will Kanos replace ? Nabi and Rashid are good bowling all rounders and Bairstow and Warner are pretty good at the top. 

SRH would be trading one strength for another if they play Kane. That's why you need good solid Indian players in IPL. Delhi has hogged all the good Indian guys.",4
Can see morgan unleashing,8
Man Saha innings is still playing in my mind. Someone should have reminded him that he playing ipl and not for bengal,17
Gill getting tips directly from SRT via Sara.,10
Who is BMac talking to with a walkie talkie?,2
This game is so boring they’re really talking about staying hydrated,10
"there's no way kkr will lose from here. If they do, I will run naked on the coldest day of canadian winter",8
Wait one question no one picked marnus in IPL?,5
A wonderful cut shot by Gill..,2
McCullum and Russell both looking bored as shit looool.. meanwhile the commentators are talking about the importance of hydration. Syed Mushtaq Ali level game.,11
"Well played dude, well played.",9
Oooh Rana just came off a hot shower 😙,3
SRH middle order would lose this match from here,10
"Good innings champ, well played. Hope to see more you in this season. Well done",3
T Natarajan will turn the tide either for SRH or KKR,5
Gill stonks 📈📈📈📈,7
"Gill should see this through to the end now, not like Pant last year.",6
Irfan Pathan is a good commentator,3
Well done Gill. KKR in cruise control,5
In think my insomnia just got currrre.......zzzzzz,4
"Gill 50(42)!

thread analysts: **pigeon shits all over the thread*",12
"Rohit, KL, Shaw, now Gill. 4 days in a row Indian openers playing well.",8
"bruh all of Natarajan's facial hair is under his chin. It's technically not even facial hair, it's not on his face",10
"In the next mega auction, most teams will try to fight for Kane Williamson.",28
"What an absolute class inning from gill 

Might be litl early

But gill>>> Shaw",12
[removed],9
Part of me wants these guys to go beast mode and get the NNR looking good,5
What a snoozefest this game,3
SRH can only win now if KKR decides to pull off an SRH,6
Legit table bottom team game,3
Srh is the new rr,4
Saha: What is this thing Gill's team members are doing? Cheering him on? Shit like that never happens to me!,7
Still think he's overrated. Can't score fast,-16
See srh this is how you chase a sub 150 total with a middle order....,4
That one Rashid ball should’ve probably been reviewed,4
The Anil Kapoor CRED ad is much better than the Madhuri one I must say,6
If I would be in one of those fan cams I would probably roast the shit out of the opponent team with my actions,4
"Shubman Gill played Rashid Khan out here 10 (8) with no false shots played,.",8
Harsha : 50 off 42 bitch 😯,3
Shubh ideal-man Gill,2
Lol DK is such a terrible actor .,3
Pandey has a mean throw,5
"the kkr dugout looks very dispirited for a team in the lead. maybe they're just tired, but they dont look like a unit just yet.",7
Morgan's losing his shit lmao,3
DK has gone from a 9-foot hero cutout outside Madras theatre to an extra getting beaten up in a fight scene,2
"Okay, mark my words. Bayliss and Warner will play Stanlake before Kanos.",9
"Pandey garu nooo, you are the only good player in the middle.",3
Gill overrated. Prithvi overrated. Everyone overrated,-11
If snail decided to fuck tortoise this match might be the video version,11
2 more wickets can make this match spicy.,5
Gosh Graeme stop flirting,7
Swann's voice seems unsuited to his body for whatever reason,4
[deleted],12
"Chad England Morgan: Fucks every bowler, hit Rashid Khan for 5-6 sixes.

Virgin IPL Morgan: Patting down full toss for single.",18
I think Rahul Tripathi will replace Kuldeep. Narine will go back to batting at number 8 while Tripathi opens. Strengthens the batting while he can bowl few medium pace overs. Kuldeep is out of form anyways.,11
Nabi Already looks like a uncle,8
There is one word that describes the way Gill has played SRH spinners and the way I've spent my student days : Effortless.,7
Just make Kane an Indian citizen . Thats the only way to solve srh's middle order problem.,47
Wanna see couple of sixes from morgan to seal the deal now,8
WTF negative bowling by Nabi,1
SRH need to have a whiff of fresh asshole to wake them up,11
"*Bowls a wide down the leg side

Crowd: 🤑🤑🤑",13
How does KL Rahul speaks good Hindi? Any Kannadigas know?,2
Just give 2 points to KKR what a boring fucking chase,8
For fucks sake KKR just finish it already. End our suffering,8
"Maybe if they made a road from England to UAE, Morgan would be able to bat better.",2
Bowl Boobie now,3
"Fuck me i get so worried when watching morgan bat. There's literally no reason for it either, just enjoy watching him bat so much",7
"In the next mega auction if teams can retain only one player, I think these are the players from each team they will retain:

RCB : Kohli
SRH: Warner
CSK: Dhoni
RR:  Buttler
KXIP: Rahul
MI: Rohit
DC: Iyer
KKR : Russell",4
I'm seriously considering changing my flair to RR to support Smithy,5
"Morgan 17(20)

IPL is not for Eoin Morgan.

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in KKR If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 5 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Ireland's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Jos Buttler is a better version of him but no KKR have Morgan as their number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted Rshid all over the park.

Today's poll

Most exciting KKR player

Who won?
Morgan with 44% Yeah very exciting singles",-11
These fucking video game crowd noises for dots. How incompetent is this DJ.,7
"Warner is giving everything for these gawar idiots. Give kanos indian citizenship and play him in the middle.
That's the only way we can win few matches",13
"Why do they call Ian Bishop, bitch?",4
"Srh: don’t take a wicket so that Russell doesn’t even come to bat 
And kkr win it without him 
Srh: modern problems require modern solutions",8
Gill smack some sixes my man and finish this game already,6
"I don't think SRH would be dropping Bairstow/Warner/Rashid anytime soon. If Williamson has to play, Nabi goes. Their bowling will have to step up to fill in, if that's the case. They really needed to buy better in this auction",7
Someone needs to do a Chahal vs SRH here for SRH to win. 3 quick wickets is the onyl thing that will win it for them.,2
Now would be the time to accelerate,1
"Everytime Morgan yells no,  it's like he is batting outside my home.",4
This match sucks only because of Saha's snoozefest,15

Lol Hyderabad has given all their players orange caps. Like a proud mom “you’re all winners”,19

This season seems like win toss lose match,9
Crowd really liked that single huh,8
crowd is going Berserk for singles,9
Time for some coke. Even though relatively early for me.,6
This partnership reaching 50 at a SR of exactly 100 is one of the least surprising things you’ll see,6

facebook an advertising company running ads for itself on TV ffs 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️,7
SRH would have had a chance if not for Saha...,10
Gill is definitely showing what he can do. I hope he has a great IPL and gets a chance for a long run for India team. he is one of all format players. He can open or bat at 3/4.,12

they need a wicket so bad gahh,8
Can we stop the gay gay r chant. I know we wear fabulous purple but it's not _that_ fabulous,17
Will Sanju fire tomorrow or fizzle out?,7
"Even after considering Billy Stanlake and Jason Holder, SRH still have the most poor bowling lineup",12
Narine opening stint has to stop as opposition teams have figured him out. Open with Tripathi and Gill (or Banton and Gill if Morgan is not playing),16
RR vs KXIP. Any other year it would be the most boring matchup of the season but this time everyone's expecting fireworks. Just 2020 things,28
Rashid seems personally hurt with that boundary.,13
I think Morgan is bored now,12

will buttler play tomorrow?,1
Too Many One sided games already man. Not good for IPL. That was it's USP to have cliff hangers back to back.,3
lmaooo rashid cussing morgan out. curious to know which language he uses for this?,5
I usually don’t like to blame a single person for a defeat. But Saha single handedly threw this innings,13
"Don't try to fix what's not broken. SRH has a brilliant opening pair and two quality bowling all rounders in Nabi and Rashid.

They shouldn't break these two to fix the middle order.

They need an IN FORM Indian player to replace them. You can't expect Saha to open unless he is in good form. He will do to Warner what Murli Vijay does to Watson at CSK. Saha moving up the order would take out 2 good openers.",6
Gill : No more tuk tuk.,5
"Off topic , is snekaer culture big everywhere in the world?",5
Morgan : Yah r/cricket. Talk nah,14
Practicing for the next game now,8
We're done boys. RIP NRR,8
Gill Kill,4
"honestly, this game got rlly interesting somewhere in the middle with the crazy googlys and it almost felt like srh could win

now it's just a fucking snoozefest.",6

Wtf happened to IPL. Last 4 matches have been borefests with one side winning with ease.,7
Mota bhai making sure MI wins something this year,5
"Narine is the pinch hitter KKR think they have

Nitesh Rana is the actual pinch hitter they have.",14
I think we (India) should steal Sam Curran. Just keep him and tell England to fuck off. They have so many all rounders coming out of their ears already.,21
They should have retired the red towel after Steve Waugh's retirement in his honour.,2
"The bowlers did an okay job this game, Saha really lost this game for SRH with his innings. Shame. Good stuff from Gill too, even Natarajan was looking somewhat promising. Bhuvi needs to get back into form ASAP, otherwise SRH are gonna finish 8th.",6
"I know designated home and away teams doesn't really matter in a neutral venue like UAE, but for context IPL fixtures did have a home team in every fixture. Based on that, the winners have been -

Away, Home, Away, Home, Away, Home, Away and now with KKR winning this one - Home 

Based on this sequence, KXIP wins tomorrow vs RR",18
"Buttler will be returning tomorrow, hopefully in-form Buttler",9

"Reason why MI-RCB-CSK get preferential treatment from broadcaster. less snoozefests, no matter what scores",7
Gill wants to finish on 69,3
"Hopefully this match makes people realise there is nothing inherently more interesting about a lower scoring game, and all that matters is competition.

RR vs CSK and now this have both been dull - nothing to do with the average run rate, just the fact the second half of the game was largely uncompetitive.",5
"We really don't have one pacer whom we can count on to take a wicket, deliver a <6 run over. MI has Bumrah, DC has Rabada, KXIP has Shami, RR has Archer, and RCB has Saini.",8
The pure joy of a good Morgan NOOOOOOOOO,12

Feels bad for srh..no Williamson!! Will he available from next match?,10

This match was too depressing guys,4
2 minutes of silence for the people who had hopes after DK got out,14
Imagine being sent out to wank off a bat and get the grip on properly lmao,5
"Fixing bat now

Gonna hit six

Tribute to dhoni",3
so williamson is fit but not playing because of management choices. but the management are using injury as an excuse. mess.,8
If everything goes right for Shubman then he might be one of the best bastmen in the world in the coming years and also the son-in-law of one of the best batsmen in the world ever.,11

"Nailed the straight drive

Shame it hit the stumps lmao",8

Omg. Something happened!,2
"Sorry I missed the first innings.

What was the deal with Saha’s innings?",5
Wtf we all knew Sunrisers can't win because the Sun has already set why are they even playing??!,6
"My god .....the background noises sound like ""ek break aur"" lol",1

Morgan show mercy please,6
Hope this is finally Morgans year in the IPL,10
"rohit, shaw, kl, shubhman. good tournament so far for india openers.",9
Captains should not win tosses from now on this IPL if they want to win.,5
The only way to improve SRHs bowling lineup is to buy Root and make him bowl in powerplay,15
I think Morgan knew what he was doing guys,32
Oh what a surprise they won,4
Here's a proper captain-cum-finisher,6
We did boys we did it ಥ‿ಥ  ಥ‿ಥ ಥ‿ಥ,9

See y’all next season bois",3

So this is how it feels to be an RCB fan,9
Is not winning toss the strat? 🤔,3
"If you are in the bubble, why not just shake hands w everyone, why fist pump. Everyone has repeatedly tested negative",13
Cummins the real match winner ! He took out 1/3rd of SRH's batting in the powerplay.,23
Another meh match. Waiting for monday.,6
Good night lads.. Hopefully a better run fest tomorrow..,1
Fire these writers became incompetent after first few matches,3
My cummo is looking happier today 😇,8
"Pathetic af. Deserve to be at the bottom of the table. Not gonna sugarcoat anything about this pathetic management, team or performance.",26
Why is Nagarkoti padded up lol,9
There is no greater pain than seeing your team losing this badly. :(,5
One week in. Only one team is yet to win. SRH.,11
The loss rate after winning the toss bodes well for RCB given our toss history... then again we have umesh so 🤷‍♂️,6
[deleted],20
Shubhman gives that Vengsarkar vibe.,3
Feels good to win a match.,7
We have better NRR than CSK rn(with 1 less match tho) so that's ok I guess,9
"Too breezy, SRH wasn’t even trying towards the end",5
Tomorrow’s match prediction?,1
Hope this knocks some sense into them and makes them bring in Kane.,14
My heart erupts in joy everytime Gill or Prithvi Shaw pulls off such gems. Hope to see both these guys play together for the senior team someday.,18
Lessgo KKR good win this.,9
"For other it is come on man

For us Cummo man",10
"We deserve to be at the bottom, sorry kanos, Warner, Rashid, Nabi and Bairstow. Apart from Pandey every one is underperforming, saha and other model order batsman can fuck right off. Even under19 players will play better than our lot.",13
Chalo bhai time to sleep good night everyone,5
Well it's a long tournament. Bound to have odd snoozefests like these,5
We did it boys! We have points on the board!!,10
I honestly don't see us winning a single game with this team combination,14
"So, RR or KXIP?",1
"Very one sided game, SH didn't get anywere close to a par score on that pitch and KKR knocked it off very handily, nice cameo from Morgan and a great partnership with Gill!",10
"So RCB, CSK, SRH fans - let's assemble after this match. We got some shit to deal with.",13
"We lost today not because of our players. More due to strategy and organisation.

I feel we are slowly slipping back to that Deccan Chargers level of crap management.",23
We actually revived KKRs fucked up NRR lmao,42
So after seeing that scores can be chased - the new parameter for winning is to lose the toss.,4
Always great to see the young talent coming through. Good to see Nagarkoti play after a long injury layoff. Well played from Gill.,2
Tomorrow will be a good game,2
Prithvi and Gill. Hope my boi Yashasvi plays equally well tomorrow,9
I know they’re Hyderabad. But didn’t know the were Hydera THIS Bad,17
Morgan 1-0 YJ Bairstow in the Ginger Derby.,25
"Somehow after 13 seasons, RR isn't the most boring team anymore. It's us. Thanks guys.",41
With this DK Performance don't know how long he will stay as Captain. If Kuldeep was even 75% then they could have dropped Narine & brought in Ferguson. With Morgan at helm they are almost perfect as team.,5
This team is literally nothing without it's foreign players lmao,13
long way to go and i hope srh bounces back. one team bombing hard is not good for the tournament.,7
"Where r those who wrote off cummo n Kkr after first game?? 

Calling cummins the worst buy ever n kkr the sure shot 8th team

This is for ya",23
The management today has demonstrated that they can’t think critically and have some very narrow thought processes.,5
"SRH batsmen - Bairstow, Warner, Pandey


SRH bowler - Rashid, Nabi, Bhuvi.

Rest 5 are specialist fielders. 

It wasn't a fair match. It was 6 vs 11. That's why SRH lost",22
"Damn, we are at #5 in tables now, climbed up 3 ranks in one match.",6
[deleted],-6
"Anyone love the ipl scorecard theme

Does it have any name or official version",15
"Well, it's a looong tournament! Can't predict one team won't do well till the end at this stage. Losing 5 out of 5 matches in the beginning hasn't stopped a team from winning the Cup. All in good time, Hyderabadis, all in good time. #RiseWithUs",1
"We should have a 'Vijay Academy' for Batsmen, and Saha would be the first applicant",19

Bitches bring in Kane or just rot at the bottom like you deserve. Damn what a shit show.,16
"Eoin Morgan snapped, go off king",4
"Here's a good news for us.

2020:..........",41

DK looks so happy,7
I'd take 3d player over this Saha who plays for the opposition any day ffs. Atleast he takes wickets,8
This dude Irish AF,11
SRH strategy for improving their batting is to go harder at the top?!! What about in the middle?!,3
"Rana's inning just gave us a flying start

N later gill n morg just could nudge around afghani jalebis for singles without taking risk

That was the game there",21
5 straight one sided games in a row,4
"Except for the very first game, it has just been ' win toss, lose match' this season",9
"i would drop nabi for williamson tbh. they need an additional experienced batter in the side. no doubt. also, idk who replaces saha but he can't be the best option?",9
This match doesn't even deserve a post match thread,23
"SRH always gambles with Warner , Bairstow , bhuvaneshwar and Rashid Khan...when these four play well they win matches , else it's a foregone conclusion.

Now that bhuvaneshwar slowly losing his form atleast in the next auction they should try and find a balanced team to get them over the line.",11
"If you think Kanos not playing is a loss...


CSK bought Karan Sharma for 5.5 crores. He hasn't played more than 3 matches in the 3 seasons.

Ffs..release the player and buy someone you would rather play. Or better give me 5.5 crores and I would warm the bench for you till I die.",30

Most boring match till now in this IPL.,3
"SRH is going to be that team this year, right?",9
I refuse to believe that Pandey hit a longer six than the one Morgan dispatched to the second tier. Mockery of a presentation this.,11
"We also paid 4 Crores for Varun  ,not saying its bad or anything but we are clearly not spending wisely at the auction .Need to build a team not just go out and buy players just like that .",-5
CSK at #6 despite playing the most games and DC at the top...this is the stuff of dreams,22
kane rarely ever expresses displeasure. but he seemed a bit unhappy during that interview.,22
Can someone please create a post match thread? It's not up yet.,11
Matchbot switched from Lancs to RCB,9
Uh Nabi over Williamson might be a little bit unwise,16
Gill being told to show the sponsors logo properly is hilarious,17
"Great knock from Gill and Morgan played his role perfectly. Only issues are they are too bowler heavy. I dont see any reserve worth making the team as well. Otherwise Narine is not ideal at top. 

That said I am not sure who would be retained next time around. I think Russel, Gill and may be couple more of young players (Varun C and Mavi/Nagarkoti?). But I would like to see Nagarkoti in a team where he get consistent opportunities. 

SRH middle order is a big problem. Need to get Kane in for sure to shepherd the middle order.  But the batting  beyond Pandey looks grim. So if Warner/Bairstrow does not perform they are going to find it difficult to win.",12
"Time for unpopular opinion. Definitely not reactionary this. David Warner is an average captain.. There.. I said it.. Most SRH fans won't be happy hearing this, but it's my assessment. The primary argument in favour of Warner is, he captained us to 2016 win. Let's turn back time a little bit. 2016 was just individual performances coming to the fore. Bhuvi, Fizz and Warner, those three carried the team with odd performances here and there. The team was rarely in coherence(expect in that Final). Our group stage Performance was mediocre and we shithoused through the playoffs. Switch back to 2018, you could see a perfect tactical captain at play. Deploying bowlers at the right time, setting perfect fields and managing underperforming personnels effectively. For a purist, 2018 IPL season was a poetry in motion tactically(until the last part). So there it's, winning an IPL might have gone in his favour, but David Warner is an average Skipper.",32
2018 u-19 wc boys getting two MoM awards in two days,14
"People should really stop shitting on Saha. He's a test player, SRH did the mistake by selecting him.",21
The only option is to retire the franchise after 2 straight losses that would make CSK feel proud of their NRR goals /s.,11
KKR🔥🔥🔥,5

"But you know what SRH, you keep leaving out your best player Williamson so you let shit Nabi play every game 🤭 Fan of SRH but their openers are coin flip and they have no middle order whatsoever. Mind boggling....",5
