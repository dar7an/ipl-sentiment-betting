If Kane is in form he can help guide the middle order by letting them play around him rather than collapsing.

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Cummins. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",6

There is no comparison.

It’s not commonly said but the team management has really botched it with their batting line up because they always make the playoffs. 

To not have any batting after 3, not one recognizable name where teams have guys who can hit till 6 and 7. Some have superstar finishers. 

SRH don’t have a batting order. They have recycled so many no name batsmen with other upcoming no name batsmen. One or two are fine to plug the gaps but your whole line up can’t be that. 

It was criminal to release Dhawan. Indian International players are gold dust in the IPL. You have to play 7 Indians in your XI, meaning atleast 56 Indians have to play in the IPL every year. There are tops 15-20 genuinely international level proven Indian players.The team with the most Indians  who are international caliber and international superstars always win.",19

He carried the whole ICL team after Rayudu left. What sets him apart from other players is he absolutely demolishes the batting attack. There is no rhythm to his destruction, he dosent care about being stylish or tries to go out of his ways. He plays by his strengths and that's what's allowed him to play for so long. Another thing that I genuinely like about him is how he enjoys the game. It dosent matter if he wins or loses, he's always smiling, dancing and makes you realise at the end of it the sport is just about enjoying yourself and being in the moment, fuck catches or stumpings! I genuinely thought he was done for after he was axed by the Sidemen but he's still going strong. It's a shame he isnt playing in the 100. No matter his form, he is one of the biggest crowd attractions and genuinely one of the most meatloaf evoking players on the planet.",2

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in KKR If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 5 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Ireland's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Jos Buttler is a better version of him but no KKR have Morgan as their number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted Rshid all over the park.

That said I am not sure who would be retained next time around. I think Russel, Gill and may be couple more of young players (Varun C and Mavi/Nagarkoti?). But I would like to see Nagarkoti in a team where he get consistent opportunities. 

SRH middle order is a big problem. Need to get Kane in for sure to shepherd the middle order.  But the batting  beyond Pandey looks grim. So if Warner/Bairstrow does not perform they are going to find it difficult to win.",11

Most SRH fans won't be happy hearing this, but it's my assessment. The primary argument in favour of Warner is, he captained us to 2016 win. Let's turn back time a little bit. 2016 was just individual performances coming to the fore. Bhuvi, Fizz and Warner, those three carried the team with odd performances here and there. The team was rarely in coherence(expect in that Final). Our group stage Performance was mediocre and we shithoused through the playoffs. Switch back to 2018, you could see a perfect tactical captain at play. Deploying bowlers at the right time, setting perfect fields and managing underperforming personnels effectively. For a purist, 2018 IPL season was a poetry in motion tactically(until the last part). So there it's, winning an IPL might have gone in his favour, but David Warner is an average Skipper.",33
