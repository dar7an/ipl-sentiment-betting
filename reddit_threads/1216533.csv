Please give us a win on MahaAsthami :),7
Today is a really important day. Every one of us is a Delhiite today,4
Lessgoooo delhi please win this.,5
Chad bois Rabada & Nortje gonna run through Virgin Knight Riders,2
"I officially predict a cracker of a game. Just don't see Delhi smashing Kolkata somehow, even tho I'd love to see it. I would say probably a last over finish, with a small chance of Kolkata beating Delhi semi-convincingly.",6
"My ass was like ""why is the match thread active so early for a 7:30pm game"" and then i realised that it's a double header",4
KKR is due for a dominant performance. Otherwise I expect them to finish 7th,2
Please kkr win this. I beg you.,0
"Apart from KKR and maybe some RCB supporters, everyone has to be rooting against KKR?",40
Karthik Masterclass Incoming hopefully,7
"I reckon rabad needs a rest today. Work load management. 

Nortje sure hasnt had enough rest in 1 game.",2
"I will be that guy and say. Sams should still continue, Nortje needs the rest. Rabada could be rested but I think he is needed atleast till we have qualified, then he can be given the rest.",1
"i dont really care about this result - dc win i'm happy (cause its good for kxip), kkr win i'm happy (good for us)",6
"If KKR bat first and get to 160, they're gonna somehow shithouse their way into winning this game.",1
"My man punt, I've been your fan since 2017. I know what a mad cunt you are. Please put the anchoring bullshit to rest today and come out all guns blazing.

Regards,

A Pant-tard",7

Dhawan averages 333 in his last 4 innings,8
"KKR should get Russell, Narine and Mavi in for Banton, Cummins and Prasidh.",1
"Does it become realistically impossible for KXIP to qualify if KKR wins this? If yes, I'm supporting DC, otherwise KKR",1
"Can someone explains KKR's musical chairs with Mavi, Krishna, and Nagarkoti? Depending on who you ask it seems all three have been simultaneously ""fantastic"" and ""lackluster"". Why not just go with 1 or 2 (if you play Narine ahead of Cummins) of them and stick with that guy?",3
"❤️❤️ Delhi ❤️❤️

*Sad biryani noises*",6
Dhawan predictions today? Surely the law of averages would catch up with him right?,1
Dhawan is ripped,1
DC should let Stoinis open with dhawan and replace Shaw with Rahane. Will solve opening and middle issues. Hetmyer can do the finishing.,-1
We're all bhenchods today!,2
Where is my homie @pikapant?,4
I feel like we're losing today cos we always suck in Abu Dhabi lol,2
Good that DC are bowling can get some work done before 2nd match,2
Kolkata Biryani > Hyderabadi Biryani,2
NOOOOOO,2
Good changes for DC,1
Happy with team changes today. Perhaps we could have batted first but chasing would be good as well as we haven't chased many times.,2
"Ok, Answer  this, and don't sugarcoat it , if KKR win, do we still have a chance to qualify?",6
[Anrich Nortje is playing](https://i.imgur.com/G2YzHBW.jpg),2
Shaw gone,1
Why kkr is playing Rana he's the weak link in kkr camp,2
"Hyderabad, punjab, Rajasthan supporting delhi today. Go DC.",4
"C’mon DC, win this one for our sake (and also KXIP’s)",1
This is not even a contest. KKR's batting is too fragile for this DC bowling attack.,2
Dude can everyone stop suggesting dumb ass changes like dropping Stoinis or making him open or replacing Hetmyer with Rahane? This shit is how you end up with an RResque season. Not that anyone from the team management is reading this thread haha but I feel like it's absolute crap tier ideas.,13
"Very harsh on Sams, its a shame but probably once and if we qualify he would be back in the side.",2
This is bad. You pick Kuldeep. Does relatively well against SRH. You don't bowl him in the 84/8 game. Then you drop him. For fuck's sake he is a quality bowler and was a consistent member of the national team!,16
Should have played Tim Seifert. Idk how they expect this shit batting lineup to still perform.,2
[deleted],5
I want KKR to win this but they gonna shit the bed,6
"This ""super over quiz"" bs is cringe af",9
"Rahane ffs 

We need to score quicker and you bring in this guy",-2
Come on Delhi do it for your Hyderabadi and Punjabi bros,4
Getting top 2 is crucial for Delhi and RCB you can't let those knobs from Mumbai get top 2 for your title hopes,3
Gill apology thread coming after his 600(100) guys.,11
guys I heard domminos is giving 50% off or something?,1
Dhawan should open with Stoinis,2
"Good move from DC dropping shaw , this will give him time to reflect and come back stronger for the playoffs if Rahane dosent perform",1
"Why good opener is needed? Because the last time we won comprehensively without the other team fucking up, it was against RCB and the opener gave us a good start.",1
Delhi pls for the love of God don't bat Hetmeyer at 6 again.,5
[deleted],0
"Stoinis is performing well at 5, so what should we want let's pull a RR and tell him to Open. SMH",2
Seems like every other team except for rcb is rooting against kkr.,1
"Hello, I am here for disappointment.",9
[deleted],1
"I am a bong, I am from Delhi, I live in CR Park, today is Ashtami. DC are my faves but KKR is very much my second team. Conflicts, conflicts.",0
"_Sigh_ let's get this over with, shall we?",4
I do not understand KKR's lineup. Pretty sure McCullum doesn't too.,7
"KKR, where bowlers come to play as batsman. Narine, Cummin.",11
"Logistically, srh fans should be supporting dc today correct?",4
Kuldeep came and went away without bowling even 4 overs smh,4
"Guess Narine is opening the batting again, not disappointed.",1
I'm not for dropping Shaw but somehow I feel comfortable with it because Punter made the call and I trust him on player development.,6
Letting a team like KKR into the play-offs would be a mock-up of IPL quality,-5
"Hotstar! Give us Bhojpuri audio language commentary yer cowards! 

Can't wait to hear Ravi Kishan saying,

*Zindagi jhand ba, phir bhi ghamand ba!*

T: Life sucks but I don't give a fuck!",8
"I want Delhi to win today to improve our top two chances obviously, but also to improve KXIP playoff chances.",5
The sheer disrespect of Kuldeep is mind numbing.,11
"I feel like if they open with Narine, he would be a walking wicket, seeing the quality of Delhi pacers.",9
"With all these folks questioning our No. 4 spot, I take solace in the knowledge that there is one team unquestionably worse than us this season.",2
suddenly I am a dc fan,8
"Glad to see Anjeer Nokia back in the camp, ready for some fiery pacey innings.",7
Good that both the team got rid of bbl hits. They perform good in bbl because bbl is shit compared to IPL,1
"Kuldeep really does not deserve this team. They need to release him so he can go play regularly for a side that would actually value him, like SRH or KXIP.",12
Supporting kkr to improve rcb chance of top 2.,4
"DC fans : my victory

KXIP fans : *our victory*",10
"Looking at the team now, KXIP is giving 2014 KKR vibes. 2 gun openers and picking up pace and winning games in a row in the 2nd half of the tournament.",2
Never have I ever taken Russell even once in my D11 fantasy team and it was totally worth it.,4
Stonis had what 1 good match? DC is a team waiting for collapse unless pant steps up massively.,-1
Good afternoon fellas. Feels like a Rahane day. Let's see how it goes,2
Nokia must be fully charged today.,2
Reminder that if you support KKR knowing well that Kolkata Biryani has whole potatoes in it you're a maniac,1
I didn't think DC would drop Shaw,3
KKR doesn't deserve Kuldeep,3
Thank you DC by not holding back and playing your best XI unlike last game,4
Let's go Nokia rabada special,1
"A team of Rahane, Iyer, Pant  Kohli, Unadkat, Manish Pandey would be confusing af. Same facial hair",2
We are playing with 5 batsman. Still trying for the lowest score in IPL it seems after last game's nearly successful attempt.,2
KKR winning spoils the fun for every other team. They are not gaining any supporters by dropping Kuldeep every 2nd-3rd match.,3
I am feeling a bit tense. Our season could end today.,2
I have no idea how we're still 4,4
"Rahane literally has 0 haters, but surprised that shaw was dropped.",7
wait shaw isn't playing?,3
[deleted],2
[deleted],0
Paschim is in the house!!!,1
Am I being too optimistic for hoping KKR will beat DC today?,4
Here comes Taher Shah,2
[deleted],8
[removed],2
"Paschim Pathak is back, bois!",2
"Anyone else see Iyer spitting his chewing gum in the air, kick it back in the air then catching it with his mouth? D: hahahaha",10
Par score here?,3
RCB should buy Kuldeep. At least we'll get our KulCha back.,10
"Why are they opening with Nitish, lol",5
Surprised we dropped Shaw.,3
"Morgan to finish on 86*

You heard it here first",3
Prithvi Shaw averages 60+ against KKR and less than 25 against all other teams. KKR would be happy with him getting dropped.,3
I'm kinda glad that Deshpande is being given another game despite being torn to shreds by Gayle and Pooran. I think he offers just a little bit more than Harshal,4
I want confidence in my life that long haired umpire has,4
Baz is just shooting in dark with his strategies,4
KKR joins the meme team chat.,4
Lol Rana,1
Scenes when Shaw comes in as a specialist fielder just like how jinx comes in when he is not playing,6
Harshal Patel is better than Deshpande,1
Nitish getting out to short ball coming.,2
"If life gives you Rahul, be not Tripathi. Because even if your partner fails, you'll get the boot. Fuck you kkr. Fuck you.",4
Deshpande to open the bowling?,2
Tushar's economy fucked by the last game ouch,9
Man this really sucks for Tripathi,6
"Gill is so underrated, he is the best batsman ever.",-1
"Like Koach's RTG, KKR have RBG(random batting order generator)",7
Why go the RR way KKR? Give my boi Tripathi his opening slot back.,6
I want to come back up again after i am being beaten brutally like Tushar comes back after that Gayle over.,5
"Wait, Kuldeep didn't even bowl last game and they still dropped him lol.",14
KKR just doing random shit at this point got Tripathi but still opening with Rana,10
What happened to the Mussel?,5
"Gill has been playing straight to the fielders a **lot** this season , if he can keep finding these gaps he can play the role that KKR want him to .",4
Why KKR not dropped Cummins yet?,5
Why drop kuldeep? He was your best batsman last match.,34
"Tum chutiye ho, why bowl deshpande now!",2
Just noticed KXIP could probably end up as no. 4 tonight,4
Kuldeep is the third wheel between the lovestory of KKR and Shitting the bed consistently.,5
Gorgeous shot. This guy oozes quality every time I see him.,4
Desh-pie-de,7
What is this? 8 runs and we haven't collapsed yet? I take this as an absolute win!,60
Why start with Tushar? Why even play Tushar in the first place tbh,3
Why doesn't DK sync with what he says in the AD lmao,6
Kuldeep should be released by KKR. They don't deserve him anyway,3
Damnit that shot made them mad and now Nortje is on.,5
Nortje and Rabada in team bowling pitch still gives 1st over to Deshpande 🤔,3
Rana looks more out of touch than Narine,6
randmbattinggenerator.exe,7
The only indian regular in this Kkr side sits on the bench.,4
Inb4 Shreyas : Tushar leaked runs,7
"Man, I really hope it's either us or KXIP that qualify. KKR and SRH have had their fair share of glory the past 3 years while us and Punjab have been shit on.",7
"Why on earth would you open with Deshpande, when you have Rabada and Nortje?",3
Haha srh with the pie chuckers at the bottom,4
"Batsman knocks it down to 3rd man

Fake crowd: whooooooooo",10
"Batsman: *takes a single""
Crowd: *erupts""",9
What kind of batting lineup is that KKR? Only 5 specialist batsmen?,6
I'm foreseeing smashed stumps behind Rana in the near future,1
"10 runs and now wicket down? Absolute blasphemy.

Edit: Almost.",3
Arre yar,2
DC tagline should be Roar Benchod to be more relatable with Delhi fans.,3
I thought Morgan would be a better captain but he is making very questionable choices,4
[deleted],7
KKR management is absolute shit. Hope Kuldeep moves to another team that is willing to give him the chances he deserves.,4
We need PP wickets. Their weakness is the batting. Exploit it early on ffs,7
Wonder why Koach gave Siraj the ball last time when clearly Morris was the more experienced and Saini was way more faster.,2
here we go again Bois,6
And it starts.,8
Gill is kill,5
Collapse in 3..2..1..,3
"Slower ball, 127kmph",9
"Shubman ""Fake Talent"" Gill",5
Let’s gooooo,3
Best yung batman of India. Wow.,5
Ah the collapse starts,3
Nortje yaar pyaar hai tu,7
Gill Gone,3
Collapse incoming!!!,3
"HERE WE GO, DADDY NORTJE",4
At least they lasted for 10 runs,7
Nortje Strikes again,3
Why is Nortje bowling below 130?,4
"Nortje in the powerplay, Rabada at the death. Too OP.",4
No powerplay if we don't lose a wicket in the first two overs. ffs.,8
Kollapse Knight Riders incoming.,5
Soft way to go.,2
Collapse.exe has begun.,1
Red hot Nortje,3
Sara needs to break up with Shubman.,-2
"They keep trying Tripathi, Banton, Narine, Rana for opening. Maybe the problem is Gill and not the others.",17
"**1.5** Nortje to Shubman Gill, OUT, that is a bit of a nothing dismissal **11-1**

Shubman Gill c Patel b Nortje 9 (8b 2x4 0x6) SR: 112.50",3
Okay anyone else reminded of Wide Putin after seeing Deshpande?,5
"Thoda intent kya dikha diye, out ho gaye.",7
"Kuldeep should move to SRH, he'd do great alongside Rashid.",8
Kolkata Knight Riders more like Col(apse)Kata Knight Riders,8
Sachin to Gill: Bolo Pencil,32
Overrated Gill,3
sachin pissed rn,16
And it begins,5
is Nortje nursing an injury? He isn't bowling as quick as he usually does,3
Tripathi opening after all,8
[removed],1
KKR switching rana and triphati as if both aren’t gonna play an opening roll anyway,15
"Jaldi se out hojata hu, instagram pe comments ka reply bhi dena hai

T: I should get out quickly, have comments to reply to on Instagram /s",5
Beautiful bowling.,3
"Sara left disappointed again.....


/s, please don't murder me.",4
See KKR management isn't that bad. Tripathi is opening.,8
Tendulkar ain't marrying Sara to Gill now,8
Gill kinda forgot how to bat,14
Even Harsha done with the randomness of kkr's batting lineups,17
"Unpopular Opinion : Even if you have great technique, if you can't score above 130 SR coming in as opener.. You are shit in limited overs. You should try your hand at Test not in T20 and now a days not even in ODIs.",11
KKR has the lowest RR in powerplays this year. 6.7,10
"If Gill makes it into the squad for the Australian tour, India is screwed big time.",9
Bc bowl out Tushar here. Don't want him at the death.,9
Iyer just want to get rid of Tushar overs,9
Pre 2018 DC would've dropped that catch and Shubhman would've scored a 70(45),11
"Just to clear up , I'll be downvoting every comment about Sara and Gill.",10
Is this umpire only officiating in the afternoon in Abu Dhabi when KKR is playing?,3
Tushar 'Hummer' Deshpande,2
[deleted],3
"Shubman watching Shaw score two boundaries and getting out: Yeh mein karleta hoon, aap jaake dream11 pe team banao",14
Tushar bowled similar line and length and was taken to cleaners last match. He is lucky he is bowling to KKR,6
"Having a heavy bowling line-up works only if the batsmen are able to score some runs.
Kkr management : I am going to do it anyway.",10
Tushar bringing Rana To form,2
Mohit Sharma is better than Tushar,3
" I agree with DC's approach to give long rope to Deshpande. They  can afford to lose a game at the cost of ensuring that they have more  than enough options going into playoffs with Harshal Patel already  performed decently. Also, not to forget it was red hot Gayle who made  Deshy suffer which is not inexcusable",5
"Come on nitish,Tushar is not THAT fast",6
No Kuldeep this time to save KKRs batting.,12
inb4 that one Delhi fan rant at iyer for not bowling Rabada enough in the first 10 overs.,9
Gabbar wtf,3
Baz needs to stop fucking around and start opening for us,18
We are all DC fans on this blessed day,23
"Even McCullum stopped writing notes in his book, after seeing this performance.",55
How did Tushar go from apt replacement for Ishant to meme bowler in 1 game?,2
"DC have four Mumbai players in their squad, three in the XI. This makes me sad",4
Joining in late. Did we end up dropping Shaw? Or make any other changes to our batting?,4
In before Iyer mentions Tushar in post match conference,7
Why does Harsha trot out bullshit opinions as if he's not quite sure if they make sense to himself even? Pretty fucking annoying.,-6
[deleted],14
Now we know where Gill learnt getting out early,13
"Just a question , why do batsmen not have 2-3 selected bats that they can just pick up and start playing , rather than brining in half  a dozen on the field",2
Gill needs to change his name to Shubman Lungs if he wants to score in UAE. His Gill won't help him score in a desert.,98
"There's no excuse for Gill batting slow because he's an opener, and he's getting the best of the conditions. His game just isn't suited to T20.",6
"Rn I can't see match on tv and I don't have hotstar subscription.

You guys are my only support. I really like this r/cricket thread and all you guys.

Wish I discovered this community earlier.",42
finishing tushar's overs early or just that Iyyer has trust in him?,5
"Why bring up players’ WAGs in the first place?

Edit: i meant when you criticise a player or make jokes.",6
"Gill should bat at 4 when the field is more  open.

Rana and Tripathi open.

Need to find a batsman for number 3.",9
Need an Axar over here,3
No-notebook-McCullum in the dugout seems weird for some reason.,16
Kkr making Deshpande look like Shami,10
"That was barely short pitched, though. Want to see a couple at his head",1
Came to this thread to see if anyone had started ranting about how Gill should never play for India based on 2 months' cricket. Tbf there's less of it than I imagined there would be.,24
"KKR as a team has a lot of detractors due to SRK, and many non Indian fans for the same reason long back.

Still CSK is # 1 team in support and hate both.

MI had hate amongst people who hated Ambanis and had conspiracy theories but its players, coaches etc. have all been mostly cool.",5
Youngster does well- oh second coming of Jesus                        Youngster does not so well- fucking crucify him,8
Cmon KG,4
Baba Yaga is on,2
That frugal woman brought just 1 Cadbury celebration box for 3 grown men,6
"Want dc to lose so we can compete for top 2.

Want kkr to lose cuz punjab should qualify.",8
Mussel is dropped?,2
"Morgan: Baz, our batsmen failed. What should we do?

Baz: Drop Banton and play Narine.

Morgan: Wait, What!! You want to drop a batsman and play another bowler?

Baz: Yes

Morgan: It doesn't make any sense.

Baz: This is called attacking cricket.",14
Umpire Pathak definitely smokes weed,13
I'd rather listen to Sanjay Manju and Akash Chopra together for a day than listen to Harsha Bhonkle for 5 minutes,-5
Right Pathak the rockstar is back today,6
"Our remaining batting line-up : Morgan, DK, Narine. We are doomed boys.",6
"Feels weird when everybody is supporting DC so that we end top of the table. 

Usually it's when we're 8th and they're supporting out of sympathy/ taking somebody else down with us.",8
Come on KG. Blow these silly smart stats out of here!,10
Hello friends,3
What is this chutiyapa man?,7
Seeing McCullum and Nayar sitting at their desk with the notebooks and walkie talkies while their lineup bats like they're playing gully cricket has been one of the more comical sights this season.,29
The 2 deliveries they’re comparing aren’t even similar,12
Narine to smak ash 6 6s in an over.,4
Is russell injured or dropped?,6
Wow. Seems like Delhi don't want Rana to leav the ground just yet. Stokes 2.0?,6
Kkr are toothless. How did they even win 5 games?,-2
There should be wicket alert every over.,5
CMV: umpire Pathak is an absolute sex god,75
That is so risky to do against rabada lol. He's licking his lips rn,10
Oh come on JP you got out sweeping A LOT more than facing the short ball,4
McCullum has been busy writing the screenplay for SRK's next movie Baz-eager.,142
Have a feeling KKR still has some fight left in them.,6
"Wow, fantastic shot from Tripathi. This guy is so underrated. Cant believe guys like Shaw play ahead of him for India. /s",10
KKR top order becomes awkward as fuck in front of quality internationa fastl bowlers,3
Ashwin or Axar this over?,2
"Tripathi definitely impressed me that one year he opened for RPS. Clean hitter, uncluttered, aggressive. Poor guy just hasn't had enough chances.",6
"CSK is playing the day game against us tomorrow, uncles are gonna get tired.",6
"Rahul Tripathi is playing fearless cricket. Those two shots, vs Rabada. That blew away my mind.",7
I would be calling out the bats and getting rid of that one. Even if it was just bad timing.,2
Rabada doesn't take wickets in PP. Bad 'wicket over alert' from Scotty.,1
Why doesn't joe Root gets picked up in the auctions?,6
"Can't take my eyes off the umpire, he needs to have a gimmicky style and he'll become a jojo character in no time",9
Nortje > Rabada,1
Tripathi has more intent than Gill and Dhoni combined.,27
2 digit total incoming,2
I was hoping dhawan broke his glasses,4
This Axar experiment is gonna be a superhit or a blow up in DC face. No middle ground in this case,2
Ian Bishop is so intense it's almost like someone died or there was a new baby born on the field.,5
Kkr & <6 RR in the powerplays. Name a better duo.,6
how slow is the outfield?,2
"Good intent from Tripathi ,, playing for the team",4
There is self harm and cutting yourself and then there is supporting CSK and KKR,3
"Always seems like Iyer first ntroduces all of his bowlers in the Powerplay like a fashion show, and then chooses who's going to bowl going forward. Why not bowl Stoinis in the Powerplay as well?",5
Axar is a champ tbh. Regardless of what he concedes today,16
Is this weakest top 3 of tournament?,2
Pant shouting discourages Batsmen from taking twos because they want to get the fuck away from his vocal chords,5
I would take test cricket over a batting collapse any day.,8
either a wicket misjudging the length or a smash hit in this over most probably,3
KKR’s batting has only been better than CSK this season.,9
Hot shot from rana,5
Mast Rana ji 👏,5
Sorry but Tripathi is roobish,1
That was a poor delivery,4
Itni short ball kyu bhai,3
Goddamn I hate kkr so fucking much,10
Appeal thi ya dukh?,7
People seeing Tripathi hit everything- What is he doing               Baz Probably- He is beginning to believe,6
Is it just me or is Iyer getting dumber with his bowling changes with every passing game,4
Thanks pant for reminding me your presence,7
Did Panty just yowl like a cat at the end of the appeal ?,9
Gambhir needs to come out of retirement and open for KKR.,9
"why no team bought Duanne Olivier, he's another solid SA bowler",3
"Okay, Pant can you please start making those noises. Batting hasn't been entertaining anyway",8
KKR and RR open based on who brought the bat lol,6
"Damn guys, axar is only 26. Feels like he's been around forever",38
I hope there's a heavy breeze breeze and we can enjoy umpire Pathak's lush locks in all their keratinous glory (~￣³￣)~,6
Sensing some smashed stumps this over,21
"From these dream 11 ads, looks like Rohit can potentially become a decent actor. Kohli is shit, no doubt.",5
"Tbh I wished Punjab won in that final against KKR. It was a weird one where Manish Pandey played one of the best innings. However bad captaincy and planning from Punjab didn't help.

OTOH 2012 defeat of CSk by KKR in final was amazing. Would've been bad for competition if CSK won thrice in a row.",9
Atleast Tripathi is showing intent.,7

"Fuck , Nortje had to play today",8
"Nortje what a ball

South African pace bowling is in good hands.",3
That's perfection. Not even mad as a KKR fan.,15
Learn from this Dumbrah. This is how you bowl yorkers.,-2
"Talking about delusional owners does anyone of you remember when Juhi Chawl, coowner of KKR said that Shahrukhkhan brings crowds to cricket and (paraphrasing) games would not be popular without him.",1
Bruh even SRH batsmen don't throw their wickets in that manner,1
Is the audience audio effects this match a tad too much than the usual over the top sound effects?,3
That ball swung late just as the ball pitched on yorker length. Fucking unplayable,7
one of the first genuine yorkers I've seen a wicket off this season,2
Why has Mavi been dropped?,4
aww the lil purple cap next to rabada’s name,1
SA could’ve done pretty well in the WC if Nokia was fit last year.,4
Why does everyone call nortje nokia? Is it a meme or what,3
Ngl that purple cap with white background on the scoreboard looks hideous.,3
Imagine KKR released Nortje; without giving him a game.,15
KKR is the dude that packs a 10 incher but can't get it up,10
MI DC are neck and neck this season. But feel DC have the upper hand,1
Ez win for Delhi today,2
Nortje's on fire,2
Wtf did he bowl a 150kph legspinner?,10
Nortje and Rabada next Morkel and Steyn,12
What a fucking delivery. Take a bow Nortje. Tripathi had no clue about that one. Wow!,7
Man South Africa are stacked for the T20 WC,12
"That was a matter of when not if, seeing how Tripathi was slogging like a tailender against Rabada and Nokia.",8
"Ah.. The sound of timber, soothing to hear.",7
That purple cap in the bowler scorecard looks bad. Should have a cartoonish purple cap rather than the actual image. Would fit the aesthetic better.,3
I'd fucking pay to see Baz's notes at the end of the season,14
[deleted],0
"DK being selfish as a captain and promoting himself ahead of Morgan.

*puts on glasses

Oh",40
Atleast 6 run per over. Appreciate the effort.,4
Stupid of Delhi to drop Nortje they would have sealed top 2 by now,4
Shaw out finally. Its like the management stopped being braindead.,-3
Lmao that colgate mouth spray ad is ultra cringe,5
"Will never forget the image of Rabada greeting Axar with "" Bapuuuuu Kya Challaaaaa?"" whenever he sees him ❤️",11
It's just Lockie Vs Nokia today,6
11 games in and the bottom 5 teams still are tinkering with their batting order and haven’t found the right balance,8
Bc Iyer slipping in a Deshpande replacement over here 😂,5
Rana wicket in this over,7
I still dont get how this team has been in 4rth since so many days,13
Is this the first time Karthik and Rana are partnering this season?,8
A leftie out there and no Ashwin yet?,6
Time to drop Gill,2
"DK is a finisher, and Morgan is a builder...

Why KKR doesn't het this logic, I don't know",26
Is there any one with a good form in KKR other than sunil narine? What happened to the over hyped pat Cummins,8
Rana is shit,6
Thank God there is no leg spinner in the opposition. Next over *Ashwin bowling wrist spin*,18
Was baz writing his novel in the cpl also?,8
"Where exactly did Rana ""leave off"" Mr. Bangar ?",1
"Imagine resting your clutch bowler when you bowl 4 overs a game and top 2 actually makes a difference.

Just DC things!",6
Kkr's batting is so bland,6
The crowd audio has gotten a lot better,7
[removed],3
I remember in 2014 when KXIP were so OP they had around 22 points in the league stage and went on to the finals but they lost 4 out of 4 matches against KKR that season lol,13
Why can't the Dugout boys call their band The Dogout ?,2
It's hard to see KKR keeping their place in the top 4,7
watch Narine come out to bat next for kkr,1
Rana used to be so reliable in MI.,7
"Good Decision by Iyer for saving Ashwin and Axar for Morgan ,Narine and Cummins",4
"Today in 220 IQ  
When you play six bowlers but not even score enough to let four of them complete their spell.",5
"Kinda worn out joke by now. But KKR youngsters, backed to the moon by KKR, credit to them, havnt shown *spark*.",13
This is the weakest batting line up so far this season.,1
People shat on DK and will shit on Morgan when in reality I'm pretty sure most decisions are determined by the coaches. As we saw with the RCB batting order shit.,7
"KKR XI looks great on paper, they just have correct their batting order, still never understand why is Morgan not batting up the order.",4
"Delhi has 1.5 bowlers that are comfortably hittable, they've wasted 3 overs off the deshpandey/stoinis combo so they have to take risk off axar and probably lose wickets against Ash, nortje and Rabada.",5
Wtf is this batting lineup man?,7
[deleted],1
Rabada and Ash both getting blood thirsty at the prospect of bowling to these guys.,1
KKR needs an experienced opener at the top. It would fix many issues.,6
Shaw not playing this game?,4
Pant has tiny fingers! Lol,1
Kagiso bowling 8th over???,2
So apparently BCCI is not doing mega auction as there are only four-five months left for preparation.,5
"DK out this over to Rabada, you heard it first here.",6
Sanjay. Please. Stop it.,7
Wow Rabada for the 7th. That's a surprise,4
I haven't seen DK do well when he comes in at these situations. He's actually a good finisher. Wasting his potential by moving him up the order.,8
TENNU BURJ KHALIFA !!,4
Lmao. Mishra's expression,8
"At the start of the tournament, I thought we had the best and deepest batting line up(T20 wise). Now I feel like every ball is a wicket ball against our batting.",10
Rip kkr,3
RABADAAAA!,4
i’m just a rabada stan account now,6
Beautiful,5
Streak continues,3
Iyer Legend bc ❤️,1
"What a ball?

DK got the second unplayable delivery of the season.",9
Fuck it. Waste of a Saturday afternoon.,5
Is the pitch slow?,1
"Get outta here smart stats
This man can't stop picking up wickets and that's more than enough",4
Kkr is proper tatti.,7
Purple Cap boi strikes again,7
Wow.,3
Fake crowd noise was weird on that dismissal.,4
So how many matches now for rabada wicket streak?,2
So I have just tuned in Dugout. Are they sarcastic while promoting Altroz? Swanny is praising the shit out of it.,5
DK inconsistency continues,3
Bc har bar garam karne se pehle se hi thanda kar dete hai,5
Sanjay sounds like he wants to drive the Altroz off a cliff with him inside,7
"And to think some people said KKR has the best line up before the season started.

RCBs batting is better even if u remove VK and AB",6
DK overrated af,3
"DC in mega auction  
Retain: Iyer, Pant, Rabada  
RTM: Ashwin, Nortje  
Agree or not?",2
Nokia and Rabada OP,2
Obligatory wicket of Rabada,3
[deleted],2
"Dear KKR management, 

That is the reason why you don't send a finisher to build an innings.. 

Again, Thank you from Hyderabad..",14
DK' batting is falling down a cliff,5
[deleted],2
Expect Baz to send Cummins next,2
I am calling dibs on 60 runs all out.,3
Next time people call Rabada's wickets useless they can fuck right off,8
Kagiso 'I'll have a wicket please' Rabada,9
"Still waiting for KKR vs CSK
It's going to be legendary!",10
KKR is like a guy with a 7+ inch dong suffering from ED. Great tools but just doesn’t perform when required.,5
Is EZEZEZ playing today?,5
*Kolkata Kollapse Riders*,5
Rabada to *ESPNCRICINFO SMART STATS™*...talk nah,14
"**7.2** Rabada to Karthik, OUT, and Karthik has been sacrificed again. He has been doing well in the second half of the innings, but KKR continue to send him in early **42-3**

KD Karthik c &dagger;Pant b Rabada 3 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00",0
Ok so the last proper batsman comes in for KKR in the 8th over.,6
How many (c) Pant  (b) Rabada up until now?,7
Did Stoin just use the knee down technique to field?,1
Rabada ne krdia Kabada seriously wtf is this commentary,6
DK has done shit all this IPL,4
"When will KKR learn to use the ""finisher"" DK properly, smh.",3
Karthik is the perfect player to take the mantle forward from Dhoni in CSK. CSK will surely pick him in the next mini auction. /s,6
"Someone arrest Swanny for false advertising. The Altroz has only 89 BHP of power, he keeps saying that it has 143 BHP.",6
how tf do they not get that DK is a finisher?? stop sending him so early,7
No Kuldeep today. It's 60 all out.,6
Naraine wtf?,1
Narine gonna lose his wicket,3
"Absolutely criminal how shitty kkr is in top 4 while kxip, playing so much more well are below",11
Lmao why would you remove a batsman when you got all out on 84 in previous match.,8
Narine?!,3
The fuck is Morgan doing? As a captain you have to lead from the front. Not pussy out,4
"take that ESPN Cricinfo you stupid fucks, stay sleeping on Rabada",3
Seems ridiculous to send DK before Morgan when his strength lies in finishing the gane and Morgan’s lies in stabilising it.,8
DK handed a sinking ship to Morgan lol,11
Narine? Lmao Morgan is trolling KKR now,7
[lol I was joking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jh58rj/-/g9w1pxu),2
Maybe McCullum and Nayar should just stop writing and use common sense. Wtf is this batting lineup,1
Fuck this......not letting this team ruin my weekend.,4
This is why KKR is never gonna fucking win anymore this season. Narine is a fucking bowler bro wtf are you doing,3
"Hey Cricviz and Scotty Styris,

Does this count as a ""quality"" wicket?!

KG got the wickets of Pooran and Maxwell the two set batsmen the last match and now DK and people keep harping about this stupid narrative. 

Not his fault he gets to bowl just one over in the powerplay. Boult, Bumrah, Archer all get to bowl 2 and sometimes 3.",2
"Feel bad for my KKR homies, today’s the last day of Durga Puja also iirc",4
Around 2019 there was DK fan army in full power making ridiculous claims like if Dhoni wasn't there DK would have surpassed him as best middle order player in India. DK is very inconsistent I am sorry but that's true.,4
Narine before Morgan? What a joke,1
Another great decision by Morgan and co to send in Narine off all the people to steady the ship. 10/10 decision making,3
"I'm sorry bmac, but what the fuck?",0
ARRRGH SHE BE A WIDE,5
McCullum should come in next WWE style.,5
"I thought we didn't deserve No. 4  spot this season  but holy fuck KKR is absolute shit, like in almost every parameter.",8
Hope rahane gets at least 4 matches. Criminal how the indian and ipl managements handle him. Chutiyagiri,-1
Has DK played one memorable innings other than the Nidahas massacre?,-1
Still no Morgan LOOOOL tf is this management,1
Narine - Best batsman of kkr,2
"Baz has escaped criticism so far, hasn't he?",6
"lovely locks indeed, he fucks",1
don't like Swann but his pirate impression fucking kills me,1
Narine playing test match. 3 shoulders,1
"""Delhi are all over Kolkata atm"" ಠ_ಠ",3
At least CSK usually have a game plan. KKR is just.... Dunno wtf it is even,9
Ok here's the next prediction lads: Narine out slogging to a spinner/Stoinis next wicket,0
Dafuq are these bozos doing? Narine ahead of Morgan. FML!!!!,1
Bish dont be jealous,1
"ball aimed at off stump now, too many leaves",2
Oh yeah this is big brain time.,1
"Quite disappointed with KKR as a CSK fan. The run rate is not nearly low enough. They should've paid attention yesterday, gave them a perfect demo",9
Beautiful leave man. Rabada is totally shocked. Brilliant move by Baz.,1
Beautiful leave hahahaha,2
[deleted],2
KKR please sign mccullum and ask him to open from next match,4
"nice start to day 1, session 1 from Narine. man's left two balls.",1
KKR using randombatsmangenerator.com I see,6
"To be honest, KKR looks more dead than CSK.",11
Narine playing like a night watchman in a T20 match. 2 well left balls.,1
"If KKR had JP Duminy in their team JP, Morgan could've chased any score",2
I miss the chris lynn and Sunil narine days,0
What is the record for most wickets in a season?,0
"What are we going with?

Rabada to overtake Bravo? Yes or No",0
Morgan be like batting tum karo me Dream11 pe team bnalu,0
not graeme yawning on camera lmfao,1
Bruh KKR just drop out of top4 and let KXIP come,1
"You got this Punjab, just don't fuck up the next game.",4
KKRs goal is to not score big as they want to prevent Dhawan getting three back to back centuries.,1
Siddhesh lad might get a chance next match.,0
Five teams are doing really bad this IPL 🙈,3
"Whatever DK does for the rest of his career, I bet for most us Indian fans, he deserves a place in the Indian hall of fame just for his nidahas trophy final heroics. Give him the Bharat ratna just for that",9
Just one more over from stoinis/deshpande and DC can complete the rest with Ashwin/Axar/Rabada/Nortje. Kkr is fucked,1
Morgan is a Coward,5
I feel like DC has come unprepared for narine and narine will slap them.,4
How did we end up here? How?,1
"Fuck sake, RCBs chances of getting to top 2 is diminishing, they have to win all 4 to make it top 2",3
Morgan Chickened out lol,1
"KKR is easily the second worse team of the IPL this season after CSK. 

They had won a couple of matches on fluke and one courtesy to Lockie.",9
"Behenchod kkr batting has given up hope, it's like they're all playing with food poisoning and dehydration, zero energy",2
"Man you give an excellent performance in IPL, your fans grow immensely. I'm pretty sure people didn't know who Nortje was before this season started and he would definitely end up with a huge fanbase due to his amazing performance.",4
That's what they were waiting for. TWO left handers.,1
Oh no. Spinner to Narine.,1
Morgan being a pussy and sending a bowler to bat before him smh,0
"Baz to Sunny: ""Bhai maar nahi paya toi hit wicket kar diyo""",0
KKR and Csk having their own competition now,2
Narine seeing of last over before stumps so that Morgan can come tomorrow and setup a big score,3
"Whatever ganja DC's camp is smoking, I want it.",3
"Ngl they've tried loads of different combinations under 2 captains

You need at least try to play a consistent XI and give them opportunities. Maybe McCullum is at fault?",2
Rabada is just insanely good. He is not even bowling 150+ which we will see in the playoffs!!,1
Pathetic captaincy again.,5
Why? WHYYYYYY?,3
"Brendon Mccullum doesnt seem to very smart strategist.

KKR management really shot themselves on foot by signing someone with not much coaching experience as the head coach of the team.",11
Ethical mind gonna get some wickets here,0
Chad Narine showing gayle how to play ashwin.,16
"Smartest decision DK took is giving up captaincy. After the last 3 matches with Morgan as captain, I am now sure that it was Baz who was making all those ridiculous batting order decisions.",9
"Morgan should send himself in at 4 every time... I know he wants to take it deep and make sure they post a decent total but this lineup is truly awful, he needs to take up deliveries early",5
"Lmao, Gauti had done experiment with Narine for a few matches and KKR is now taking him for granted. Bunch of idiots.",10
Just the red herring before Narine gets out trying to slog,3
"Morgan to Narine: Tum batting kar lo, main Dream11 pe team banata hu!",21
Mankad attempt this over,2
Spin isn't workin here clearly. Axar and Ashwin are gonna be EXPENSIVE,2
I love narine,1
"""Sunil Narayan"" - Sanjay Bangar",8
Narine is the best batsman in this lineup,3
How is narine pronounced,1
4D chess by Morgan to confuse r/cricket,4
If lose another wickets in 2 overs it's game over for us,1
Lezzooo Ash come on come on,3
Let’s zooo yaar,2
Difficult to understand the thought PROCESS behind Butler batting so down the order?,1
"When someone asks me about my mental health, I tell them that I am more dead inside than Sunil Narine",4
I think he should simply mankad Narine now,1
oye hoi hoi,2
I can never understand KKR 's fascination with Narine's batting.,3
Narine be like : Russel who ?,6
We're going to settle for 3 aren't we?,2
"KKR never looked like a cohesive group ever since Gambhir left. It seems like these guys don’t even talk to each other once the match finishes. 

KKR is another franchise who should just nuke their team when the next mega auction comes. Players can find a better home and the team can be built better.",3
"Unrelated but whatever

Have you ever butt messaged most inappropriate message ( not anything vulgar) to the absolute wrong person.

How long does the cringe last? I am dead here.",1
Are Pat Cummins and Lockie in next?,1
brett lee’s mic? lol,7
Morgan didn't pick himself in his Dream 11 team.,8
Check your mic Brett,5
Rishabh Pant’s customary “Cmon Ash cmon Ash” hahaha,9
"Desphande: 2-0-13-0

Nortje- 2-0-10-2

Rabada- 2-0-9-1

Axar- 1-0-7-0

Stoinis- 1-0-5-0

Ashwin- Idk guys the pitch seems like a belter",9
"KKR GOING TO SCORE 160+. 
YOU HEARD IT FIRST HERE.",4
"As long as we don’t bowl Stoinis, it is a win.",0
Bro wtf is happening to the dugout audio,1
Brett’s audio is having a rough time,1
Who do u think is the best spinner in the world rn?,5
Bowlers are much better in stopping collapse than batsman. That's a proven fact.,2
Is dugout audio fucked?,1
Did Brett Lee's mic conk off?,3
"Is the pitch bad?
Nah we are bad",6
Narine out this over. Calling it now.,3
I will not be surprised if Cummins comes in next.,4
Would really love if Narine destroys Ashwin and breaks his comeback hope in Indian team. After 2015 WC & 2017 Champions Trophy I have nightmares seeing Ashwin in Indian jersey with white ball in his hands at bowling run-up.😞,2
"RCB and MI both got their share of NRR, now it's our turn",9
How will Dhawan score his third century if KKR doesn't score above 150?,23
[deleted],6
Pashchim Pathak has the full potential to become the next Tata Altroz for the dugout guys.,5
Dhoni saw more spark in mutual funds than the youngsters in his team,28
Narine is going to smash Deshpande,0
Narine is the best batsman in kkr squad,2
Where are the narine haters now? (⌐■-■),5
Top 3 teams not letting each other breathe. Loving this,5
Hypothetically Can Joe root be of any use in kkr team if they picked him ?,2
Narine doing his best to get KKR up and running,3
Iyer trolling Morgan with his bowling changes,5
For KKR bowlers are batting and bowlers are bowling.,29
DC plays Tushar to gift some runs so as not to appear bullies.,3
**Kagiso Rabada** has now taken at least one wicket in each of his last 25 IPL matches. The record is held by **Dwayne Bravo** with 27 consecutive matches.,7
Why do we always have to play at least one shit fast bowler,1
Narine kala jadu krke aya h aj,5
KKR has now been reduced to an NRR farm for the top 3,13
Paschim Pathak is that Pakistani dude who sang Eye to eye,6
"Tushar, Rabada, Nortje.

There is one imposter among us.",6
Iyer captaincy template says left handers implies bowl Ashwin. Doesn’t matter if left handers are only dangerous against spin.,3
Iyer - Tushar is shit,2
"There's a KKR vs CSK match remaining, I am looking forward to it.",27
Deshpandey is exactly the kind of bowler Narine loves.,8
Lol Tushar facing another West Indian,6
Did Narine smile towards Iyer??,5
"Tushar managing to be shit even against KKR, takes skills man",11
Wonder what KKR had during Time out....,4
Tushar is Shardul Thakur Lite,4
Forgot Rana was still at the crease.,3
Brain dead captaincy by Iyer,2
"What happened to Harshal? He was pretty decent bowler and a handy bat, why did they get rid of him?",2
Tushar was doing so well in the earlier matches. Maybe bring back Harhsal Patel?,4
Narine smiled. Note down the time and location. One for the history books,7
Knowledge and entertainment wise isn't Binga the best person in dugout? Doesn't overdo the Altroz thing as well.,3
Aw jeez,2
We desperately need a good indian pacer. Even Khaleel is better than him.,2
What's the point of giving a second game to a bowler who got smacked for 41 runs in 2 overs the previous game when you've got a seasoned campaigner and all-rounder in Harshal Patel.,5
"Man, Iyer was right about Deshpande. Fuck off man",3
90 more runs and our bowlers can have a solid total to defend,6
Get Harshal Patel or Mohit Sharma in instead of Deshpande,1
Tushar deshpoondey is absolute trash,1
Justice for Harshal Patel,9
Harsha commentating- ASMR                                                           Bishop commentating- Anti ASMR,1

How many more matches before they realize that Stoinis is a better bowler than Tushar and he can bat too?,6
140 might be tough on this pitch if KKR reaches that.,1
The yorker worked but he went back to bowling shit. Bhai kab sheekhega.,0
Narine has done his job can't ask more from him,8
Sanjay Bangar’s fake enthusiasm + extra long description when a boundary is scored is more annoying than the fake crowd noise.,1
No Russell today though?,1
Why doesn't Rabada wear the purple cap lol,7
Should have played Narine instead of Banton last match,3
Why play Tushar again after last game.,0
Dinda so proud of Tushar rn,0

So we're done with the 5th bowler. 4-0-36-0,2
Me and r/cricket eating our words the one day Narine experiment comes good.,3
Interesting fact: Rabada was born 10 days after Tushar,7
one over from Tushar potentially changes the course of the game yet again,5
Everyone's getting out then there's Rana Ji like  👁️👄👁️,0
Off-topic: Borat 2: Subsequent Moviefilm just landed on Prime Video India.,4
"saare baal katwa le tushar, Takle pe Hawa lagegi to shaant dimaag se bowling karega",2
Stop trying to make Tushar Deshpande happen. It's not going to happen,1
How is Bangar the guy they come up with to partner fucking Brett Lee and Swanny in the dugout? Imagine someone like Yuvi or maybe a Dravid instead.,2
Deshpande when he sees a Carribbean player - *Maro MUJHE Maro*(Rajpal Yadav face),4
Iyer is gonna mention Tushar in the interview isn’t he? Hope the interviewer asks him why he becomes Thala while batting first too.,5
Kkr breaking their middle over curse,5

"Better bowl deshpande out, if Morgan comes in, pardon my French but he is gonna buttfuck DC wjth pinch hitting deshpande.",7
Deshpande is bowling terribly,1
Please someone dismiss Narine,1
What is this captaincy ffs,4
Why is Iyer not trusting Axar or Aswin more. Ridiculous,9
Uppish but safely in the gap. KKR's luck might be changing.,5
"Tushar is still pretty young, he will get better the more he plays. Gosh if every youngster was immediately removed after 1-2 bad performances I wonder where every successful cricketer would be",11

KKR getting boundaries? INTENT™,4
How good is Iyer's captaincy? Objectively.,2
This is **INTENT** you mothafuckas,8
shit captaincy,3
"Wtf DC, bringing narine and Rana in form",8
"Narine's really changed the momentum of the innings

Rana's got going as well now",2
bruh our top batting order other than Dhawan HAS to show up.,14
Rana ji 👌👌,2
I'd totally watch a film named Reign of Rana.,9
"Nitish rana boundary percentage 69%
Nice",4
r/Cricket curse working again,5
Sunil Narine is thinking he is facing RCB after seeing Tushar ji,6
Damn these have been some hella costly overs,3
Shreyas most capped player of DC,4
"Iyer at match presentation:

Everybody played well. Except Tushar deshpande",18
So Tushar has bowled 3 overs and Stoinis is bowling is 2nd. Meaning one of Ashwin & Axar will bowl 3 and not 4. This is bottom tier captaincy.,5
"Excellent use of Narine by Morgan. He knew DC would want to save Nortje and Rabada for him so this would be the best time for Narine. 

Now either Narine makes the most of the worse bowlers or he faces balls from Nortje/KG that Morgan then won’t have to!",7
"Plenty of Indian bowlers who bowl 140 but you need to be able to move the ball laterally too or have one special skill. 

Tushar Deshpande doesn't get extra bounce or is someone who can swing it with the new ball. He could easily go the Avesh Khan, Basil Thampi route. 

Delhi were unlucky losing Amit Mishra and Ishant Sharma to injuries. I'd play Harshal Patel especially now that the wickets are getting slower and tired. 

If not play Mohit Sharma. Poor guy got only one game and was made to bowl at the death. Mohit Sharma can defo swing the new ball and if given the Deepak Chahar, Sandeep Sharma role and made to bowl 3 in the PP, he'd be more effective.",4
sometimes good batsman will make good bowlers look like shit,3
good to see delhi havent forgotten where they came from,18
Bro someone teach Iyer Maths pls.. 1xstoinis + 3xtushar = 4 overs of 5th option bowling. Why the fuck is he bowling 1 more of stoinis..,8
Tushar is a fodder for Windies batsmen,5
[removed],5
I think KKR should open with either Cummins or Lockie. It's the only thing that seems to work for KKR.,7
"*score > 84*

Aur KKR samarthako mein khushi ki leher!",14
"not bad captaincy from Iyer tho to bring to Stoinis, Narine is better vs the spinners than the pacers",1
I don't like what's happening.,10
DC need to figure out thier 3rd Pacer cannot play Deshapande in playoffs against a team like MI with Pollard and Pandya,13
42 off the last 3 overs. Peak DC.,1
"Everyone bashing Iyer when Pant on stump mic was saying keep pace from one end , pitch doesn't support spin much.",5
Ashwin should bowl more,2
I hope Deshpandey improves but I suspect he'll be following the footsteps of Our Vinay Kumar.,1
Does KKR only play well when Narine is in the team. If yes then why so? (5 Marks),8
"Sunil ""I play one good innings and they will let me open"" Narine.",5
Iyer being way too conservative with Rabada and Nortje has cost him the game before and today looks the same,7
rAnA iS sHiT,3
That was excellent.,2
Did Pant just say kuckoo?,2
Just wish we dont fuck up again,2
Narine wicket here,2
He premeditated the reverse sweep and ashwin bowled it even more outside off so that he can hit it finer. Kya bc chutiye,3

Delhi please don't lose this.,4

Narine proving me wrong,5
"*Delhi Capitals... Delhi Daredevils*

Aaja aaja.. Main hu pyaar tera!",9
Our lord and savior Narine is here... redemption for kkr is here!!,5
DC going back to orignal form :(,0
"Specialist Batsman Sunil Narine reporting on duty, Sir!",7
Just bowl Nortje and end this cameo pls..,7
I hope KKR learnt their lesson last game. They look more sober today,7
Thank You DC! It was a good run whatever it was.,5
"KKR KKR KKR LETS GO BOYS NO JINX , DO THIS FOR RCB",4
"Good comeback this, from KKR. Rana stepping up well after a lean patch. Somehow Morgan looks like a Galaxy Brain captain with his decision to promote Narine.",13
This is KKR batting from last 2 seasons. All guns blazing!,7
Wtf is wrong with Ashwin,4
Ok this is out of script,7
Kkr are tearing DC apart,6
KKR showing intent?,5
Ethical Ass: ✅ Kicked,5
Ashwin's being taken to the cleaners wow,2
This wicket has nothing for spinners,3
Narine now a proper middle order batsman.,7
Ashwin Ka axar Ka Tushar Ka sabka quota Pura karega ye stoinis,3
Rana and Narine on fire,3
Swann keeps making fun of the Umpire and I'm all for it,4
Insert Johnny lever meme: Aab maja aayega ba bhidu,3
happy with the spinner on?,2
Did the pitch suddenly change to sharjah lmao,4
Since when did George Michael drop down and play cricket? Fuckin' solid lefty he is..,1
Yeah I’m turning off the TV. It’s clear we only won most of our games due to one guy carrying us each game. Just support MI every year guys.,-4
200 on the cards lads?,3
Damn. All the pressure is off,1
To go by history under pressure Ashwin is toothless. Too many haunting memories from Shahid Afridi to World Cup Semis to Champions Trophy. 😞,2
ಥ‿ಥ ಥ‿ಥ  ಥ_ಥಥ_ಥ,1
Should Delhi send hetmeyer Up the order,1
[deleted],1
How quickly things have changed,1
[removed],-3
"Not the day to lose today DC, hopefully Rabada and Nortje can fix this later on",5
Thank god someone stepped up for KKR today to stop our batting collapse. Thank you Narine and Rana.,4
Ashwin was long due this hammering.,4
Need some good pace to pull things back,2
Not very ethical to let KKR sneak in at the expense of Punjab and SRH.,5
Wtf is Ashwin bowling,2
Bowl Pant you cowards,3
Time to get Nortje or Rabada back on. DC have to break this partnership and neither Narine or Rana are great players of pace.,3
"Narine is rubbing off on Rana as well, I have missed him so much",4
After yesterday's game this is starting to feel like a lot of runs.,7
Ashwin getting thrashed on this pitch ooofff,1
"This lack of trust on Axar Patel is just comical. Probably the best player this season after Shikhar, Rabada & Nortje.",2
RCB fans supporting KKR,6
Absolute masterclass in releasing the pressure,5

Luck is again on our side,1
Circus,1
dafaq dizz running,1
"The meltdown is insane, tho i relate guys its just the first 12 overs, 28 overs still remaining chill",4
DC ARE FUCKING IMPLODING,2
Morgan is way too good to be at 6?,2
Why not just lob it to Nortje?,2
What was that. Don't give it away like that.,6
Sunil doing the cha-cha,3
Please don't.,6
Axar is an idiot,2
Village running,3
Absolute circus,3
Axar wtf. Nokia got there,5
"That's a big missed chance

If he delays the throw for a second, Nortje would've been able to get back. Obviously tough to make that decision in real time",3
Lol Narine trying to get run out so he doesn't have to face Nokia,5
Lol ..both don't want to face nortje.,4
I guess the comeback talks of ashwin in India LOI side doesn't look good now does it ? Always falls when he's put under pressure,-1
"If axar had given the ball to nokia, it would be out.",7
why does narine want the strike lmao,3
What is this Narine playing Russell innings?,8
"Hetmyer out for Sams could be a viable alternative if we have a good Indian pinch hitter or even if Shaw performed(we can bring in jinx) .

Deshpandey leaks way too many runs to stay.",5
I think we are gone lose a wicket,9
Please don't get Narine on strike against Nortje. You are asking for Narine to get out!,6
[removed],4
Delhi like always fuck up at Crucial Stages,11
Narine's whole shtick is to smash spinners and medium pacers. DC played right into his hands with the bowling changes.,10
"Oh, Swanny sings now?",2
[removed],3
"Partnership 62*(31)
Lynn-Narine opening flashbacks.",10
Intent,1
"So Axar actually sees Narine half way then somehow decides he wants a direct hit instead of lobbing it to Nortje and then whines at Nortje.

What a twat.",13
"I'm scared, please get them out soon",3
"Bruh just bowl Axar, there's no point trying to hold Axar back rn bc Morgan will eat him alive anyway",7
Do you think Baz and Abhishek Nayar copy each other's notes ?,2
of course these fucks who made 84 last game blast against OUR bowling line up... what tf,7
Come on Delhi. Don't do that to us,3
Good captaincy by Morgan tbh. Put a wrench in dc's plans. Can't bowl nortje and rabada that would hurt us in death. Can't bowl axar bcoz narine. Can't bowl ashwin bcoz narine and can't bowl Tushar bcoz narine.,5
I’m an IPL casual. Does this game mean anything?,5
Someone needs to tell Sanjay Bangar that its opportunity not apawrchunity,-1
"**Ashwin to Rana in IPL** 71 runs (27 balls) No dismissals

from cricbuzz",7
"If kkr wins , what are the chances of kxip making playoffs?",9
"No way are we chasing anything above 150 against a line-up of Cummins, Ferguson, Nagarkoti & Prasidh.",7
"Other teams have good players 
We have luck",6
Am I reading too much into it to say that maybe Morgan is getting his stamp on the team after a couple of games? Classic attacking approach that the England team usually show under him.,3
Who is Surinder?,3
Who's surinder?,4
Who's Surinder? Rana ji 👏👏👏,3
"Fuck banger, he just shouts everytime there is something.",3
What was he holding that jersey for ?,5
Who's Surinder?,6
He just called Nitish Rana Natesh Raina,3
"Nitish ""Raina"" is accurate today :(",7
175 -180 would be match winning score here,3
"Rana loves the Delhi bowling line up, doesn't he",3
Yo KKR winning this EZ,3
Sanjay Banger tries to sound exciting in an incredible bored voice.,3
What was that celebration by Rana? He held a  kkr jersey with SURINDER written on it. Any backstory?,8
Who's Surinder?,7
Who is Surinder,7
Take the timeout ffs DC,4
Russell is a visitor now?,6
That's what Baz wanted to see from batsmen. Intent! Confident and positive batting!,4
I say bowl out both Nortje and Rabada here. And pray for the last two overs.,3
who's surinder?,7
Surinder?,3
Milestone up with a streaky shot. It happens more often that not in cricket that way I swear.,2
Daddy Narine with his BIG DICK SIX,3

Rahane's not good enough and Iyer + Pant haven't been great",2
The Josh ad is so cringey!,2
"OOTL : What was the gesture? For a friend? 
Respect.",3
That was smashed outta there,4
"No way this batting line-up is chasing anything over 150. So, 4th place it is then.",2
"This partnership is giving me hopes, thanks Narine and rana",8
Eoin Morgan. My fucking captain,9
Why. Why Stoinis now,3
DC threw away all the good work,4
Graeme *Blackbeard* Swann,2
Narine is a legend,3
Shot Sunil,2
Where was Rana hiding that jersey?,7
"Narine showing Stoinis his ""aukaat""",1
Thanks for not brining in Rabada,3
Lmao narine is there for only one reason and he shows it every ball,2
"Just bowl Axar

Stoinis, Deshpande and Ashwin have been dicked anyway",1
I'll do you one better. Why is Surinder?,4
Lol getting hit by Narine in 2020,1
This is absolutely pathetic. Shreyas Iyer finally showing his true side of being a captain.,1
Good luck bowling spinners after 15th over now.,3
r/cricket in the mud. Saying that sending Narine in was an awful decision.,15
Wtf is happening,2
Narine motorboating the double Ds,4
Bhenchod bowl Axar,3
Bowling Stoinis to Narine is asking for trouble,5
Bro bowl Axar,3
Is the ump a woman,-1
"Since other players have gotten memed back to form, why not Rana",8
Stoinis: Gazab beizzati hai yaar,7
This is phase where DC is vulnerable and MI has the upper hand I guess when comparing MI and DC.,7
"Last 5 Overs, KKR 67/0",6
Spank me please,3
why on earth are they not bowling Rabada now????,2
I thought Rana was asking DC if they would like to surrender.,5
Oh bhai maaro,3
Who's surinder?,2
"Daddy Narine, what a stud!!",2
Spank me please... LMAO,6
Bc 180+ score incoming,3
Love this hit out or get out strategy by sending narine,7
stoinis getting cunted :(,2
is the ground short? this shot doesn't look like it would've cleared boundaries much less this into the stands,1
Did DC peak too early,11
Scenes if Narine gets a century,5
DC messing it up with their bowling.. Need to find 3 more overs from Ash/Axar/Tushar/Stoinis :|,2
"KXIP fans don't worry, They have a game vs KKR. 

KXIP vs KKR on 26 will probably decide 4th spot",5
SPANK ME PLS.. Horniness for daddy stoinis slipping into commentary,3
Kkr is gonna post 200,3
Fucking hell DC,7
"For all the hate Rahul gets, I’ve never seen anything in particular from Iyer to suggest that he is a quality captain",10
why no axar ?,2
Sunil Narine > Rest of the world,8
This is such poor bowling,6
"Sunil ""Russel"" Narine",8
210 + score,2
r/cricket bringing KKR into form,7
Narine loving his pies from the pie chucker,7
Iyer again losing the plot.,3
Has anyone heard Narine speak?,3
4D captaincy from Morgan by sending in Narine,5
Can we build a statue of Sunil Narine outside Eden Gardens?,6
God damn that is a glorious umpire,8
Narine is batting like Gayle today. Certainly a hint of it.,2
Hoping Pant to show 2018 version today.,6
Iyer's captaincy over the last half hour has been quiet terrible.,13
Stoinis is bowling pies to the extent I think I could hit him around the park and I bat at 11,2
"As a KKR fan I am really enjoying this. But I definitely don't understand this modern trend of not bowling left arm/leg spin to lefties and offspin/chinaman to righties. 
Come on, where is Axar?",14
C'mon now take their wickets or something,4
Credit to Baz/Morgan. Showed attacking intent after being 42/3 could’ve easily put in Morgan and just built their innings but Narine’s been perfect and  gave Rana a boost,4
Narine century incoming,7
"Danny Morrison just saying ""spank me please"" on national television lmao",54
Lmao what's with the Lazytown sounding music,3
[deleted],12
Only Delhi can do this,11
The best/weird part of this partnership is these guys are not talking with each  No words at all. Just communicating with hands.,4
[removed],3
RCB has better bowling lineup because they can use Saini in middle overs,3
Russel sitting with the babes lmao,7
Scenes if DC misses top 4,5
"Poor captaincy. Not bowling Axar at all, not bowling Rabada here.",7
Surinder kon hai?,2
"Naraine gets out for low score 
Commentators - he's not moving.

Scores well.
Commentators - doesn't move and that's what  
i like about him",33
Bowling wide Yorkers to Narine is a different kind of rock bottom.,6
"Other teams : Bring on their best bowlers when the opposition starts going


DC :Risk hai  to Isq hai

T: where there's risk there's love",23
Stoinis figured narine out? Bowling a wide yorker?,8
I think this umpire is only allowed to attend day matches because he is some sort of reverse vampire.,12
Why wouldn't you bowl Rabada now? This is the game right here. And it's escaping for Delhi.,6
"Rana's FIL, Surinder, who passed away recently. Mystery solved.",16
Come on DC I trusted you :(,8
"To avoid bowler persecution, Narine seemed to have converted himself from Bowlerism to Batsmanism.",8
"Swann: ""Surinder is the late father in law of Rana""

Respect, Rana!",54
Was that an edge,2
Surinder seems to be Rana's now late father-in-law,25
Axar's overs are left right?,4
[deleted],-11
The nation wants to know. Who is Surinder?,10
"Andre Russell watching Narine's batting -

Bhai! Bhai!! Bhai!!!",8
"Punjab fans, even if kkr Win this, if we win vs srh, we still have a chance",6
What a shot that by Rana,5
Surinder is his late father in law. RIP,19
If this score's being set up just for Dhawan's 3rd century i'll accept it.,13
200 pakka,3
Is this plan of avoiding bowling left arm orthodox and leg spin to left handers just data analysis gone too far,5
Who is Surinder? What's the Rana jersey context?,2
Narina showing the power of his big DICK.,0
Ponting looks furious,4
Paschim Pathak has Hugh Mungus dick energy.,3

84 runs from 4’s and 6’s... so far...,5
"Yeah, keep Rabada's two overs till the match is gone. Great captaincy, Iyer.",6
God these Josh ads are annoying,7
"Surinder is Rana's Father in law, nice of him.

RIP.",10
"Ponting not here for it, he wanted that 84 all out team",6
I don't know whether Baz imagined this onslaught...,9

Ayo wtf bring Rabada back,5
What the fuck is going on?!?!,4
"This man is a fucking idiot

Ashwin given a third when he's been dicked

Just bowl Axar you idiot",9
Why bowl Ashwin again man? He’s gonna get cunted,6
Delhi owes Calcutta for taking away their capital status. Glad they are returning that favour.,6
So are folks convinced about our bad captaincy now or need more games?,8
Bc Axar ne kya bigaadha he bhai?,7

The batsmen get comfortable against the shit bowlers and so when the good bowlers come back they are set and don't have pressure.

Of course one has to come off in order to achieve 20 overs from 5 bowlers, but it is very rare that someone bowls 4 on the trot even when they are on fire like Boult was",4
Who is Sam's fielding for? Hetti?,3
“I’ve been treated unfairly and batsmen don’t respect me” Ashwin YouTube channel 24 October.,11
Morgan Cummins still to come go guns blazing,6
Have a bad feeling Ashwin gonna cost us T20 WC next year. He'll be great till semis though. 😭😂😭😂😭😂,4
This line is working,8
60 off 30.. against delhi. that just happened,9
"People asking for Rabada, deed has been done...you want Morgan to face bad ones later on then !!!(he scored 44 in 17 last time against KKR) , now only DC batsman can reverse it.",5
"Pollution in Delhi plus pollution in Delhi captaincy

I tried lol",14
Bruh this shit is pissing punjab fans more than the dc fans itself lmao,66
Ponting is going to murder Iyer and Axar in the break.,11
We need to score 180+ if we wanna win,9
Good comeback from Tushar,7
"Credit where credit's due

Far better over from Tushar here

Edit: and he ruins it on the last ball lol",12
allowing deshpande to properly fuck this up,5
Holy shit that was a smart shot by narine,12
Wow Narine scoring 60 of 30 and that too not in powerplay,19
"Oh Dadddyy , yeahhhh Narine",9
Iyer hates Ashwin and wants him to lose confidence/s,6
Narine playing like a proper batsman,7
Narine 64(31) . Are we in 2018 now?,10
Behenchod I missed this match for mirzapur. Bc usme sirf randibaazi hi chal rahi hai,7
"what a comeback from Narine, KKR missed the trick earlier lol",5
You cant ban him for his batting,20
This was all part of Ashwin's gambit to exact revenge on KXIP,10
Tushar is DC's gift to other teams,6
Narine will hit century,3
Should be a  200 if Narine bats through,5
It's raining fours,2
Get Shaw off that emerging players list please. He is a veteran of IPL now.,8
[deleted],3
DC have no reason to panic. I don't see why they can't chase whatever KKR make.,5
You know it's a bad day when an over off 9 is a good over.,7
"Good over tbh, only 9 runs that too with a wide!",2
do the same with Andre and they'll be in top4 easily,4
Suddenly DC's bowling looks ordinary,4
Narine 100 coming up???????? That would be such a slap in the face.,6
ffs just get rabada in and tryna get a wicket how difficult is that 😭,3
"Us: OMG we suck as a society, we are always close minded wtf

Us again after seeing an umpire who looks different: WTF is he even a guy lol",20
economical spell from Tushar,2
I would’ve given Rabada one over at 11/12 over mark and expect him to pepper Narine with short balls.,1
Narine had to clean up Tushar and gift him that perfect 10 economy,3
They're gonna bowl this exact line to Pant today and he's not hitting anything,4
DC and narine single handedly killing the hopes of SRH and punjab.,5
"Narine got warned for his bowling. 

Comes back as a batsman. The absolute madlad.",62
Bro Narine really gonna topscore against us 😭,9
Narine is redeeming all the conserved points of the matches he didn't play.,12
Random bowler selector would bowl Rabada earlier.,7
Westandees kiwadiyabo,6
Narine first 100 loading,2
Narine century can provide another edge to 2020,9
"Bring in Axar, if he shits the bed then Iyyer can rub his balls on our faces, if he performs then we can blame the poor captaincy without a doubt",8
"And this is why Shaw would have been good, Rahane probably gonna waste 16 balls and score 9",6
Only gabbar can save us now,3
"KKR next 3 matches KXIP, CSK, RR can easily qualify",6
"Narine moves to the off-side wide line   


Deshpande be like - why target the stump, let me just bowl straight to Narine..",5
Man Narine really hates SRH and KXIP,12
">According to Hindi commentary on Star, Surinder is Nitish's father-in-law, who is unwell right now

>An update on Rana's father-in-law. He was unwell, and died yesterday. His celebration was a tribute to him. Condolences to the whole family. This has been a tough year for everybody

Narine is a legit batsman with these shots.,6
Iyer looks like he has a head growing out of his head,3
Petition to feature Narine in Ashwin's next Hello Dubai'ah? YT episode..,6
Why is Gayle umpiring today?,2
Did you see that. Narine is batting on another level today.,2
One over of stoinis still remaining,1
DC is the real meme team... They peaked too early in the tournament.,2
Destini 125 looks like an Activa 125 clone. Don't we already have enough of those on the streets? 😒,3
Is there any explanation for persisting with Tushar over Harshal? Conspiracy theorists where you at?,3
"I’d love to see Narine get 100, but that ain’t happening vs Rabada and Nortje",2
Narine 100? I don't want to jinx it tho.,5
Why no kuldeep today??,2
Dugout has officially started referring to Pashchim Pathak not as the umpire but as The Pirate... Well done Swanny,8
"Batsman: Hits 50

r/Cricket : This will be a well deserved 100",6
At the rate KKR is going it looks like a minimum of 220,3

Watch narine destroy DC with his bowling too.,4
107 from last 8...,4
"This umpire is bringing back the days of Sex, Drugs and Umpiring.",8
"Calm down, Sharman",3
I didn’t see Rana’s celebration. What did he do?,5
Delhi really ruining bottom 4's chances lmao.,8
DC shitting over SRH and KXIP.,9
Great captaincy by Iyer. Ashwin fed 30 off 2 overs. Let's bring him back for another so he can feed 45.,6
"bet Rabada and Nokia will bowl 17, 18 and 19. Stoinis will  get the 20th.",6
Happy that DC are losing because we're competing with them for top 2 spot but sad that this might sabotage Punjab's chances of making the playoffs..,8
I am getting the feels that our bowling will fuck this up,11
Rabada ka Kabada,13

"Bloody hell well luck is on your side, an edge on yorkers from Rabada can also go for 4s",1

Sad to say Rana is getting out this over,3
Third man being in the ring has cost them a lot of runs,2
"Bless him, hitting rabada too",3
Short turd man,2
"According to Cricbuzz, Narine now has a SR of 286 against Ashwin in IPL without being dismissed even once.",6
I know it's due to the two lefties in the middle but they were carving up Ashwin and let's just not talk about stoinis. How bad could have Axar had been?,5
DC won't qualify this way. Others will catch up. Damn.,5
Edges and mishits going for boundaries is so infuriating,11
"All said and done, Pathak is clearly the right man to umpire a game like this.",8
"44/3 at 8 overs. 
They’re at fucking 155/3 after 16. 

Jeez",22
This is great intent but my god is he lucky,-1
"a 190+ chase after so long, fooooooooooooooooook yeah",6
"KKR bounced back in style here. Captaincy change, best player injured, seniors not performing, batting order blown away 3 days ago. Looked like they were down and out.",4
"Another incidence were r/cricket memed Sunil Narine into form.

This never gets old.",3
"I don't see the point of not bowling Axar, next batsman is also left hander and more dangerous, why even play him then",2
"One thing I've noticed this IPL

When bowlers are bowling well, some teams try experimenting too much and end up fucking up

Then when bowlers are being tonked around the park, the team gets too rigid with the ""process"", and keeps sticking to plans that are clearly not working. 

Thats how yesterday they got away after being 43-7 and today as well",10
"WithDC's batsman doing very badly, Good Luck chasing this down.",6
IYER & Rahul our next captaincy candidates nobody gives confidence atleast KOHLI had some euphoria which we were looking forward for,7
I want Morgan in now but I dunno man. Rana might hit a few out of park.,7
"Not long ago, backing away like this was seen as showing fear of the fast bowling, now it's showing no fear.",5
"If KXIP / SRH win all their remaining matches, they will make it to the playoffs, won't they. 

No point worrying about KKR's performance here.",3
"Ffs ~~DC~~ DD, all of us were counting on you",11
"Axar to 2 lefties would have also been a disaster. 
See what DC and MI did to CSK.",5
Hey how do you reverse meme a player into form? Asking for a friend,7
Nice catch,2
Jinxed it,3
I hope my man Danny Ricciardo has a better day today than his buddy Stoinis..,3
Haha get rabaded,0
Fuck Morgan to rabada now,3
[deleted],2
Any one using the Cricket.com app? I think it's cool.,5
Narine did more than enough,22
Well played,5
Tactical wide,2
Almost a six off RABADA. GG Narine. Now KKR needs to pay him back by winning.,6
"Brilliant knock from Narine

Now they've got Morgan walking in lmao",4
Fucking finally,2
Atleast we’ll get to see some aggressive Delhi hitting right from the start,2
Sunil Narine 👏👏👏,4
Show over but what a great show he put on.,2
"Learn from Rabada. Nariane is shit against short balls, no DC bowlers before Rabada were even attempting it.",6
Well played Narine!,3
Not surprisingly Narine gets out to a pacer,3
You sir have done your job! Thank you Sunil!,8
M doing Narayan Narayan on maha asthami today,9
" Narine is disappointed ,he wanted that 100 lol",7
That's a great early Diwali Bonus,5
Shoulda brought him earlier Iyer 🙃,2
"Ok Narayan
 You did your job",10
Rabada’s smile I think I died a little,5
Lmao and they say rabada’s wickets have less impact,11
"Lund le behenchod, finally some good fucking bowling",5
"You did your job, Narine. You brought some positivity in KKR's dugout with that innings.",17
KKR must change their name to KNR (Kolkata Narine Riders),10
This could've happened in 13th over but safe and stubborn captaincy cost them extra 40-50 runs.,13
Thank fuck,3
There is something about Narine and Gayle. I love watching them bat.,8
Rabada's regular two wickets no one coming close to Purple Cap,3
Should have done long time back when narine walked into bat.,2
Best time to get out. Now Morgan will take care of Rabada and Nortje. Bruh why are we so bad.,4
I didn't really watch the middle overs. What the Ashwin do so wrong? He's being blasted left right and centre,4
Finally..,2
I just want one match where rabada doesn't get a wicket,6
"Batsman after r/cricket gets credit for him coming back to form:

*Hours of net practice session wasted*",40
That was a good shot though.,6
Lovely 200 S/R innings by Narine,6
Great from Narine🐐,8
Dominic Cork is still upset over the Mankading bless him,7
Here is captain morgs,7
Finafuckinly,0
Who would’ve thought bringing in Rabada would prove beneficial eh? Definitely not Iyer,9
Well played Narine Babu 👏👏,5
He did enough damage already. These are no longer 200 is chaseable pitches anymore,4
Iyyer is a shit captain. It is only because management has been good by Ponting.,10
Send Gill to No. 4 and open with Rana and Narine in next game,1
Rabada stopped us,6
We are losing this and we are giving up on the NRR too. Well played fuckers,3
"**16.4** Rabada to Narine, OUT, big boundary and Rabada gets his man. He digs this in short, cramps Narine up by following him, meaning the short off boundary is taken out of play. He pulls, makes a decent connection, but not decent enough to clear the big square-leg boundary. Caught, but has he played a match-turning, a season-turning knock here? **157-4**

SP Narine c Rahane b Rabada 64 (32b 6x4 4x6) SR: 200.00",2
"Dominic Cork: "" Ashwin was bowling round arm robbbish"".

We needed shaw today 😂,7

Why the hell is Cork defending Iyer?,0
"Why the fuck are you bowling a bouncer with fine leg in the ring? Idiotic

Bowl to your fucking field",7
"10 of Rabada, I'll take it",10
Axar bowled his first over for 7 runs. That over was in the powerplay. Ashwin bowled his first over for 13 runs. Outside the powerplay. Guess which bowler got 2 more overs from there on and which didn't get a single one. Shreyas' captaincy and batting has been poor for quite some time now.,5
This is all Iyer needed to do in 9th over. Too late.,3
"Give me 185+ I ll be happy

Lockie n narine both playing tonight",14

The funniest part was Rabada literally laughing at Iyer after Narine lost his wicket.,9
"**S Narine's Highest IPL Score**

Ponting shadow captains DC. Iyer is shit.,6
"Yes the captaincy has been bad this game, but blame defeats on Iyer and the victories on Ponting is extremely convenient, decide who and stick with it",6
Damn Ashwin got tonked,1
"They’re gonna bowl Stoinis in 20th over, and kKR is gonna whack 20 off that over.",1
"The team version of Nohit-Brohit is DD-DC

Today DD turned up, not DC",16
"Both Cork and Styris are right. The bowlers have been poor but the bowling changes have been poor. Should have bowled Axar and not Tushar more. 
Hope Iyer doesn't blame Tushar alone today.",14

Pointing angry with the field placement,3
Questionable field placement.,2
Ponting is really scary,8
These field placements make no sense. Iyer has been terrible past 2 games.,9

The only way we win this is if ponting scold the fuck out of dc in the break and they chase it out of fear,21
DC death bowling is really best in the tournament,4

"After this Sunday, the 8 teams get divided into 2 groups, in such a way that they play games only amongst themselves

- Group A - SRH, DC, MI and RCB
- Group B - RR, CSK, KXIP, KKR

Basically, Group A will be fighting amongst themselves for the Top 2 spot, as tryna try their luck at somehow making the playoffs against the big guns. Group B will be battling for the 4th spot (not CSK duh)",11
KKR have a good score. Long chase ahead.,10
Score 👏 more 👏 boundaries 👏,7
I love Rabada. He's such a class bowler. Hope he breaks the most wickets record,7

Either mankad or do youtube channel shit,0
"Umpire: has long hair

Swann: Arrrrr",5
I think the reason KKR are playing the extra bowler is in case Narine gets disqualified from bowling in the middle of the match.,14
Ashwin singlehandedly destroyed any chance of him getting back into the India White ball team,12
Rabada beast mode.,8
30 run last over incoming,5
Rana from Haryana fucking his neighboring state up :(,6
"Iyyer hoped ash or even his middling bowlers would leak a little bit of runs in the middle overs with the pressure mounting up and maybe take a wicket and he'll save nortje after Rabada for death, that's a valid strategy, what's not valid is not giving axar a single over when your other options are stoinis and deshpandey.",16
Iyer needs to take over pooran if we have to win this one.,3
Rabada is a crazy bastard. Is he considered better than Bumrah in death overs?,5

"FYI, Rana has a good record as an opener. KKR should go with Rana-Tripathi from next match. Gill at 3",2
"I know the Narine experiment worked, but Morgan should ideally be batting higher, it's just a travesty that such a player is batting so low",3
"KKR : Will help Lord Siraj get back into form.
Also KKR : Smash the best bowler for 10 runs in 2 balls with beautiful shots.",2
Eoin Morgan is making some strange decisions. Although Narine came off today but many believed Morgan should bat at 4. Why is he coming so late to bat? It's possible the management is making all these decisions and DK was receiving flak for no reason since the time he took captaincy.,1
"So, Rana will get a 100 here?",1
"Love how versatile Morgan is, can play anchor or finisher at a very decent level",5

Dehli look to be faltering at the back end of the season once again, almost like reverse Mumbai",9
This just shows me how good was RCB's bowling in the middle overs as well,3

Should just open with stoinis and dhawan. Go big or go home from the start.,2
Opening duo of Rahane and Dhawan doesn't inspire confidence to me while chasing nearly 200,9
That's an extremely weird field,2
Behenchod rana has scored a lot of runs off us but he still doesn't feel settled in.,3
Rana looks possessed.,3
Dhawan to Shit the bed today.,3
""" Delhi doesn't look like they wanna play cricket today"" 
Damn BC",10
Shreyas Iyer deserves this. Behenchod I can't put it in words how bad his decisions have been today.,10
Delhi wtf,2
"Looks like Delhi is fielding with 6-7 guys only, no matter where the ball is going there's no one at the boundary.",14
"MI are winning this aren't they

They've lost 3 matches so far, 2 in super over and 1 was the opening match. 

They look unstoppable",12
You had one job cunts,8
"Delhi's playing very average cricket. Dhawan has been the highlight over the past few games and Rabada-Nortje have been excellent. 
Everyone else has been pretty average these last few games. Our batsmen need to step up today. All of them.",10
Y'all are acting like Dehli can't chase this down when they have a guy coming off back to back centuries as well as a solid and deep batting lineup behind him. Even Rabada can hit the long ball,7
What was the Surinder jersey that Rana held in his hands after his fifty?,5
"Rahane should start steady with Dhawan accelerating. When Rahane is set, he should accelerate too. He’ll probably get out but it doesn’t matter. Anybody who comes in should accelerate almost right away",6
Well played rana,6
Never seen an umpire stand like that before?,4
Great innings,5
"If Delhi Kulchas lose this match, it's on them. Bowlers could've done much better. Dafaq was Ashwin doing today?",11
Who is the DJ telling to do a standing ovation lol,9

Great effort from Rana,3

I hope you will stop comparing virgin dc with chad MI after this.,7
Six last ball to bring up 200.,3
Rana did real good here,3
Is Dehli gonna sh!t the bed while being on top the whole tournament and not make playoffs again?,-2
Cunt this last ball out the stadium Morgz,2
"**19.5** Stoinis to Rana, OUT, short, outside off, gets it high, and Rana has fallen to a short ball that has got big. Who would have thought? Except that it has happened in the last over of the innings and not the first. Top edge for a catch inside the circle. A very important hand in an emotional time for Rana **194-5**

Too late cunts. Too late,3
"Honestly I thought we would barely make 140 after that poor powerplay. This has been an amazing performance from KKR, with a bit of help from Iyer's bad captaincy. Lockie and Narine should be able to defend this easily!",14

Pointing needs to give his rubber bat to his batsmen if they want to chase this down,6

Narine saved KKRs asses today. Rana played well but without Narine's early blitz he might not have played with the same freedom.,22
"Thank God, Gill got out cheaply.",10
I never cared where Hetmeyer batted till now but play him at atleast No.4 today.,3
KKR redemption thread? Irrespective of the result.,1
194 and that too without their best batsman Pat Cummins facing a ball.,10

Can Delhi chase it??,2
nice that they've gone back to the classic scorecards. used to hate the half batting half bowling bs,5

Can Dhawan get 3 in a row perhaps?

Or can Pant finally fire?

And like the rest of the batsmen also do their jobs?",8

3D chess by mah boi Gill by getting out early today,6
"Everytime delhi bowling rescues delhi batting.

I don't think so delhi batting can make up for the bowling.",6
Game on I say. Big bad mustachioed Lockie Ferguson has some runs to play with.,3
Pace was the factor today and Iyer couldn’t even got that. He has managed to remain captain till now just because team is good. Fuck sake. Give it to Dhawan on the basis of seniority and i will still be happy. Fucking hell.,3
"Just woke up boys, how's the pitch playing?",1
Ashwin 12. Ball 50 redemption coming,3
"Narine's contribution with whatever role kkr hands him, is brilliant,  what a team player",8

Why did Axar only bowl one over? Only gave away 7 runs and I don't think that he would've done worse that the disaster that was Ashwin's spell,4
With how we played our first 7 games I thought we were the best team this season. Mumbai are clearly a class apart. Going to be extremely tough to hold the top two spots.,10

Delhi can chase this if rahane and pant turn up for the occasion,3

"The whole right left combination and don't bowl a leftie to leftie or a off spinner to a right hander is totally overrated and way overused. Yes, it's useful in some scenarios but it should not dictate every single move. 

When Gill got out, KKR sent Tripathi and DK to keep a right left combo. Eventually tho, we saw two lefties batting together scored 120 odd and also scored the most vs a off spinner. 

Just bowl and bat your best players more often than not. It's not that hard.",8

"I get pissed at people asking why Bangar is in the dugout, dude has top notch analysis",15
BRUHHHHHH BISH SPEAKING HIS MIND,8
"Kkr has a good team , but only thing bothers me is that in order for them to do well some punt or experiment has to come off ...its ok for one or two games in a season but not for every match.

No 2 matches they go with same batting order or same bowling resources.

Why karthik comes at 4 is beyond me ..

Also if you are too dependent on hit or miss narine to bail you out every second game ...Good luck on the playoff in case you qualify.

Not telling them to be predictable but too much experiment or punt won't help either.",11
"Dehli do have firepower down the order though, don't count them out",2

Rahane should go Pujara route now become exclusive test player or his test place might aslo go,5
"Dot ball Dhawan is cringe.

God I love Bish,4
Bish dont give no fucks,8
"Darren Ganga coming close & singing in Danny Morrison’s mic  

*social distancing intensifies*",7
Bishop sounds mad as fuck at being old.,12
"Bish responding to Double D Morrison's ""Happy Birthday"" and cake cutting antics with ""there are other things I could do with the knife but I will stick to cutting the cake"" :)

Happy 53rd Bish.",16
Actually think we needed rahane to concentrate on test cricket like pujara is doing. When India will be 50/4 in Australia real soon we need people to bat specifically in test matches,22
"If DC lose this one and RCB win tomorrow, will RCB be the 1st team to qualify for the playoffs?",6
That pickup and throw from nagarkoti was 🔥,3
"Wrong decision to drop shaw at this point imo, if you stuck with him for this long you have to play him till the end imo",5
"The outfield is very slow but the leg side is shorter, need to go a bit aerial.",4
What are the odds of DC becoming original DC from here on? And loosing all the matches. Just like OG DC.,3
Does DC have an Indian middle order batsman in their team? Let Stoinis and Dhawan open maybe?,1
Dhawan gonna take it away from us isn't he?,6
Just tuning in...the cool umpire is back it seems,6
"Missed the first innings, is this a good batting surface? 194 chasable or nah?",2
Need to bring lockie,2
If Dhawan does it again. The batters should do shaashtaang pranaam to Dhawan daily till IPL finishes,4
This Dhawan can be the issue for KKR,5
Prasidh Krishna handing all those *Prashad* balls,3
"**1st Innings 190+ at Abu Dhabi, IPL 2020 -**

Wouldn't have thought even in my dreams that dhawan would be carrying DC's batting.,8
"Whichever team you support, deep down we all want panty to play a good knock today",7
Iyer needs to play a captains innings.,1
"Everyone asks where is lockie, no one asks how is lockie ;(",17
Rana had only one scoring shot in the V. Is there anything different DC could have done to exploit that?,2
BRING LOCKIE NOW BRING HIM SOON MORGAN,7
Bangar is all over Dugout now with his analysis,3
Need a big innings from pant,3
Delhi can experiment by sending Akshar at the top.,6
Absolute Peach,5
"Pat, I am cumming",3
Cummoooooooooo,3
Match over!,2
Cummins back in form with a bang!!!!,2
If DC doesn't get going Lockie gonna tie them up in the middle overs. Unless he does what Ashwin did today,3

Cummins apology thread coming up,6
"Top bowling

That's probably game over",10
Is this real life ?,7
Cummins investment finally paying off,2
Jaffa,6
And lockie is yet to bowl,6
Finally Cummins getting the wickets he deserves,5
WTF is happening?,2
Winning is over rated :(,5
3rd century is out of the menu bois,3
Brüh,3
"Cummins coming into form would have long term implications ... 
Good luck india.",11
And Ferguson is yet to bowl,3
"Of course Cummins bowls brilliantly today. 
Delhi is bleeding. I hate this feeling.",7
DC exposed,8
RIP,2
fuck me that's a jaffa,3
"Just 9 balls in,it's already cumdog's best match so far",4
Yes kill DC NRR,7
No gabbar today,3
And that’s gg for DC,3
Cummo bowling like a million dollars in the desert heat 🔥,7
"Cammo and Narine in form, KKR winning IPL?",6
Game over.,3
Control Uday Control,3
Pat!!! Please don't do this in November!,4
DC must be pissed that Cummins comes back to form against them lol,10
All those sweet sweet 15 crores finally brearing some fruit!,9
"Our boi Cummins finally doing the thing we wanted from him, kkr🙌",10
I love you Cummo,7
Finally fortune is smiling upon us,5
Pack up the bags DC and bottom 4 xD,7
Oh pattiiee!!,3
All permutations and combinations got fucked now,2
Cummins will not bowl like this for the rest of the tournament.,6
Ffs why's lockie's soul in Cummins?,5
Aaarrgh!! Hate to see Gabbar get out!,6
"Cummins, Narine, Rana all needed DC to get back to form",3
Cummins finally delivering with the ball too.,6
Cummins doing what he's best at. Getting back into form right before the India series?,13
"babakaalibhed in shambles

"Welp, no 100 from Dhawan today. Should be an easy win from here on specially with Lockie and Narine yet to come.",6
Almost like what Abbas did to Stokes this summer,4
"KKR hain taiyyar!

Let's go boys! What a ball!",5
The ‘D’ in DC is gone,3
"You took a long time cummin, Patrick! :')",2
Give that man his 16 crores!,10
Now that's the Dhawan I know and don't love,9
"KKR: Looks like Lockie will be our strike bowler now

Cummo: **Doesn't look like it**",16
Narine and Ferguson hasn't even bowled and DC are 2 down,2
Every rcb fan should thank kkr. They saved our nrr twice and are now defeating delhi so we move into top 2,10
"**2.3** Cummins to Dhawan, OUT, like the London buses. And it tells you the old thing about bowling: you keep bowling well for long enough, and the wickets will come. And if they come after a long interval, they will come in clutches **13-2**

Bruh cider coming in form just at the right time of the tournament,2
"U-19 to IPL switch is not easy. So many players from 2018 team were hyped as world beaters but no one has stood out till now as genuine match winner apart from Parag. Gill, Shaw, Nagarkoti, Mavi, Abhishek, Arshdeep. All good players with great potential but now it is time to take the next step.",3
Law of averages...,3
Ash really pushing the envelope by sitting next to Ponting lol.,5
Funding casually doubled his season wicket total in less than 3 overs,7
Cummins you beauty !,8
Cummins clutch,6
Delhi fizzling out harder than Samson,5
We getting in to CSK mode in last part of the tournament. Phew,4
Stop playing badshah songs DJ! That's what's causing the mayhem,1
"Cmon pant, 128* again. Bachao yaar",3
Time to turn it off?,2
All my predictions true so far,2
Special innings from iyer.. come on...,3
"Figures, Cummo gets back in form just in time for the test series.",6
"Honestly guys if dc loose here, does srh still have a shot",2
Imagine DC sh!tting the bed from here on and not making playoffs lmao total scenes,16
Someone get the dumbass Josh ads off air please,5
"End of 2020, DD is back.",6
Cumdog cumming to the party finally.,7
DC should take leaf out of CSK book and play for NRR now,4
Lockie gonna lock em up soon too,6
Well there goes our only batsman from the previous match,5
"Pant walking out to face Cummins and starts outside the crease

BDE",5
"Every KKR fan rn: Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?",16
Cummins is possibly on the moon right now,8
"So if KKR wins does that mean that the top four are locked?
-MI
-RCB
-DC
-KKR 

(in no particular order)",7
"Bruh if Cummins is doing good now

Varun, narine, lockie and Cummins is a fucking lit combo",16
I'm sure it means nothing but Ashwin sitting next to Ponting looks awkward af right now,6
"It's curtains pretty much for the bottom four.

Dead rubber galore.",5
Cummins on #hairlinewatch,7
Cummins:- 2 wickets in 2 overs. Funding secured,18
"*my stream is late*

Now that's a million dollar baby !!",6
Iyer- Pant please do the WI T20 innings again thanx,4
Lol y does pant only cough when batting.,11
"Pant with a 124 sr

Look how they massacred my boy😔",10
Perfectly set up for a big pant innings. It’s been a while,4
Ra-1's team too good for The-1.,1
Pant is long due a good knock,2
That was a Test match wicket. Wow!,6
[deleted],-1
Time for RCB to remove the mask as well. DC has removed it already.,6
Dhenier would have been proud of that defence. Pant showing he is indeed the chosen successor,6
I blame this all on that 1 arrogant DC fan,24
"""If only cummins wore yellow today""

- Dhawan (Certified Australia basher*)

* ICC events only",10
Typical big price players coming good in the end side of the tournament.,5
This is great opportunity for pant and Iyer. When India will be 5/3 in icc semifinals they need to step up,10
"KKR destroy DC's NRR✔️

DC's confidence fucked✔️

Thanks KKR",10
How did all the KKR players come into form in the same fucking game?,7
"If kkr Win this and we lose, our season is basically over today",2
Let's see how pant reacts to this situation,1
Didn't watch majority of first innings. Were there any missed chances in the field when Narine and Rana were batting? Making a list of match ke mujrims.,2
"Bruh someone give rahane another chance

It was varun who was batting instead of him",1
Late season collapses always depress me in any sport. Shit man,5
"All the bandwagon DC supporters can you all fuck off now, this isn't surprising for us OG fans",6
"Lot of wickets earlier on in the innings now, is this a sign that the pitches are becoming more bowler friendly?

Come on Dehli, you guys can do this.",3
Don't forget about the NRR. Prioritize that first rather than going for an improbable victory,4
Dc is going last year's kxip way.,3
"Who will russell replace now, when he is fit?",1
Rabada deserves a better team.,4
At this rate DC will finish 4th. What a decline.,7
This is a terrific chance for KKR to improve that poor NRR.,14
Want the upcoming fuckbois of Indian team to do well today.,4
Pointing will never play for NRR,8
I'm done with rahane btw.. Fuck him,5
After 10 Matches Cummins only had 3 wickets even Simon doull said it's stupid to play a player just cause he's costly. Kudos to KKR team for sticking with him 👏,10
We want 48! RCB fans more than KKR.,4
"We still haven't qualified. We have to beat either SRH, RCB or MI to qualify. This is going to be extremely tough now.",13
Looks like it is a time for me to write. Delhi's top order is shit.,6
"http://imgur.com/gallery/A3wB78D

I told you soo...",0
"Rahane has failed in all four matches. 

Shaw is better, when on song he will make full use of the powerplay atleast",10
DC still has a shot as long as iyer is at the crease,5
Please win DC,5
Is there a reason why they don't bowl Lockie up front?,5
"Please upvote the Match thread guys, it's hard to find",8
DC have to get going now tbh and take advantage of the powerplay. Still 4 overs of Lockie and Narine,2
Atleast he's bowling at 145,4
"Cmon lads, the RRR is 10 which is possible. As shown by KKR the pitch becomes easier to bat on. All they need to do is hang in there, these two. Only problem is that you have an in form Ferguson to deal with",11
Mavi>Nagarkoti,1
"Just tuned in, whoa... Wtf",2
"I feel that performance of another international pacer Ferguson has rubbed off in good way for Cummins..

Earlier when we was going plenty there were others also taken for cleaners .. Sometimes you just feel ohh the pitch was flat , batters played well.

Now when Ferguson comes up with a performance like he did in game 1 , it pushes Cummins as well.

Tbh, Cummins is a good bowler may not be t20 specialist but overall a good bowler.

And regarding price tag, if unadkat gets the money in crores ...Cummins does way more in international circuit year by year to command the price.

It all depends how many times want you in same auction and with presence of so many Aussie coaches n support staffs Cummins was bound to get a good deal.",14
And their goes over chance to play in playoffs,2
May be I am trying to jinx him but Iyer is looking gold today.,9
Iyer always gets a stiffy when KKR bowls,8
Nagarkoti doesn't look like a 145 kmph bowler at all,14
Is mavi playing today?,1
What will be the margin of Delhi's loss? 50? 100?,5
Just when i thought we were winning prasidh steps in,2
This is stupid!,3
Feels like deja vu from yesterday's match.,3
DC should play for NRR.,7
Cummins No.9 on MVP list woahhhhhhh,10
God that announcer's voice is obnoxious AF x-(,4
Where's my homie PikaPant??,4
Deli needs at least 55 after the powerplay to have a chance,2
If KKR and KXIP win their games today then the KXIP vs KKR on oct 26 will pretty much decide the no4 spot,6
Why delhi team looks worse with every match? How are they top of the table? Looks like it is MI vs RCB then.,10
"If Karthik now screams ""NaHt EeZyyy bOiS"" I will forgive his 3(6)",6
Overseas fast bowlers have started flexing their muscles now. Will be an interesting second half of the tournament.,3
I think Delhi will win,0
Iyer-pant to do a specialist fielder-3D?,5
That purple cap is so badly photoshopped,5
Plz let Lachlan bowl in the powerplay,2
"Last time they compared Shaw with Rahane, now Rahaee with Iyer.",7

Ngl kinda missing the sight of the yellow painted Dhoni fan and RCB uncle and Sudheer Kumar Gautam in the stadium,6

2 rr players in that mvp list lmao,2
"Bowler two balls into spell gets hit for 2 boundaries

r/cricket: <bowler he replaced> is so much better than him",11
How tf is cummins 9th on the mvp list? He's been absolute shit with the ball,-1
Just saw that analysis. Iyer for the Aussie test tour instead of Rahane.,8
I feel DC still has a good chance.. if they can build a partnership between Iyer and Pant/Hetmyer. Two more wickets for KKR and the game is over,1
Pant is playing like a wimp... Go on and smash some,2
DC still recovering from that Universe boss over,5
Thats my boi,1
"Why doesn't Morgan bowl Ferguson, give him atleast one over, makes no sense tbh",5
"Shouldn't be a surprise, Delhites are used to choking when the winter sets in.",4
[deleted],5
Pantastic!,2
"Genuine question, Ferguson not gpod in powerplays?",5
The umpire is going to have a back ache,2
Man this would have been the perfect opportunity to play Hetmyer at no 3.,3

Anybody got prasidh krishna domestic record? I wanna know what kkr saw in him,2
How did that go for a six?,1
140 will be a ideal score for Delhi on this pitch. I think they can chase that,2
Off side play from pant is almost nonexistent,2
"Time to end this ""sensible"" bullshit, Pant. Be the senseless bail you were meant to be.",15
The playoff teams are finalized.,5
DC gonna lose. I'm sad.,2

Delhi woes started when they asked a gujjar to be sensible,3
"Lol, is Pant ever gonna get checked out by a doctor, or just keep going around coughing like General Grievous?",2
I can’t take this umpire seriously man,3
Ponting's philosophy of freedom comes with its own risks. Some players thrive under pressure. Seems like there is no one apart from Dhawan in this batting order ready to put his hand up and say I'll take the responsibility.,2
"Just with shot selection, you can tell that Pant ain't in good knick.",2
"KKR, just finish DC's innings early. People are looking forward to El Clasico.",3
"Fuck if dc and mi lose and rcb wins

They'll be at top! Fuck",2

Imagine getting 2 singles in two free hits,2
more rock n roll umpires is clearly the the T20 way,2

The umpire is just a hipster dank god,5
"Mavi, Nagarkoti, Prasidh - rank them according to your preference.",1
Sidenote- Has RCB ever lost a match in their go green jersey?,4
I don't understand how you can bowl no ball after no ball unless you're really trying to.,2
It hit his helmet??!,6
Bruh what a waste of a free hit. Just tonk that,0
"Bc out of all the ground, he hit it straight to the player ffs we're done",2
"DC gonna lose, it's all about by how much.",3
Wow 2 no balls but DC couldn't make the most of them at all,6
Lmao what is this garbage no ball back to back? That is turrbl.,1
Prasidh you are a vishudh chu,3
Not my Pant :(,1
Just tuning in. Shaw dropped or injured?,1
Well he managed those Free Hits well at least,2
Prashid wtf,2
why can't these young guns fookin rotate strike?,2
***ROCK AND ROLL UMPIRING***,1
This is very poor from.krishna,1
does he have any plans on finishing his over.. jesus,2
Prasidh having a brain meltdown,6
9 fucking balls bowled in this over!! The fuck ??!,7
I know this sub adores pant but I honestly don't see the hype around pant. He's a very low budget Suresh Raina at his worst and a medium budget raina at his best. He has two proper shots and everything else in his arsenal is a slog with his entire body behind it.,7
9 ball over lol,6
This over has been long as fuck,7
[removed],6
Most of this thread is about the umpire lmao,11
Pant plays too many shots off balance,2
lmao this umpire cracks me up..,3
Pant needs to raid Shaw's cough syrup stash. He's been coughing like crazy.,22
"I blame the media + Koach & Shastri for 'responsible' and boring Pant

Let him play his natural game",5
"He's not bowling badly, but God, the extras",11
lol,1
The umpire looks like that bad priest from Padmaavat.,8
"Actually Prashid is impressive here, just 2 singles on 2 free hits",8
Garbage over,4
"Prasidh is a good bowler, but extremely inconsistent!",8
Thank god this over is finally done!,7
Bowl lockie or we boycott srk movies,21
Go DC show them you're top team this year for a reason,1
A 9 ball over goes for 12. Lmao,11
12 runs from 9 balls. Not a bad over at all.,7
"Ha bhai Krishna, don't finish your over. We are here till 12.",4
Now ik Delhi fans are naturally pessimistic and we have a right too but for a change lets be optimistic eh?,3
Why does pants body language look so lazy,13
Paschim Pathak is the greatest chad in cricket history.,8
"Once you dig deep into this DC line up, the batting is very fragile. Their batsmen peaked early in the tournament and Dhawan the last few games but it looks so weak once one player doesn't make runs.",7
Prasidh Krishna is the bowling equivalent of Sanju Samson. There are 2 or 3 good performances and he retains his spot through the IPL season.,12
Delhi needs someone like root in 3/4 to provide the structure.,4
Holy shit wtf happened to dc lmao,2
Lockie and Cummins should be bowling the first 4 over.,3
India need to look at Ishan Kishan alongside pant. Maybe a good backup/replacement when needed,2
"2 NB, 1 wide. DC still score 7 out of the 5 balls from Prasidh's last over.",9
Can someone tell me why lockie doesn't play in power play??,3
Pant with an innings that would make Thala proud,7
"So give Ferguson a go a little early for once, yeah?",4
This is like reverse kkr. KKR hit it everywhere where there were no fielders. Dc hitting it straight to fielders.,7
Dravid looks more awkward in that ad than youngsters in CSK squad trying to impress Thala.,14
"Look at their Sr, its csk tuk tuk batting",4
Delhi needs someone to play exactly like Manish Pandey did for SRH vs RR,2
I think we are gonna lose this,1
Idk why but I'm kinda feeling comfortable about this match. I think we can do it,2
Why doesn’t he bowl lockie ? Someone explain the logic please,4
Is Flash not good with new ball?,3
Iyer and Pant struggles have opened up the dreaded number 4 position again in Indian team for wt20. Prepare for another saga guys. Who'll be the next 3d?,3
"""Naam h siddhu"" best montage.",6
What movie is Swann talking about??,6
A lot has been said about Delhi's Indian batting but they really need Hetmyer to face more than six balls a game.,8
Kya captain hai re yai T:What is this Morgan? Give Fergunson or even Narine one over,1
The Bollywood movie. Goal?,1
Lockie and Narine gonna choke DC after 8 overs,6
I love swanny,3
"As a SRH fan, please Delhi do it for us! Don't shit the bed",8
do these kids not have classes to study for,5
I guess Lockie is more comfortable bowling without the restrictions on,7
We want that 2nd spot,9
Shreyas ¿yer,2
3 out of the 5 top scorers this IPL have been from the bottom half of the table. Team sport.,11
Lara: 'lucky' ferguson,5
Pant seems to be coughing a lot hope he's okay..,6
Some people here want Pant to score 100 off 50 every match. He is trying to find the gaps without playing any rash shot and he is still getting shat upon.,6
Is swann talking about Namaste London? Wish he would give a hint about the story,5
Delhi's bowling >>> Delhi's batting.,7
These are good conditions for pant to come back in form,4
Why is Pant batting like this?,8
What the actual fuck!! How did KKR get to 194!! The last time I saw the score they were 52-3 after 9 odd overs,8
Looks like we are going after the NRR. Too sensible for the chase,5
PRASIDH HIGHLY SUS,8
Fight Club has a good montage,1
Good play. Get through the power play and then hit a ball straight to Cummins at long off in the 7th over.,2
Bring on the long sleeve Fergie,3
KKR were in the exact situation after the powerplay,2
"What a shitty powerplay, 6 rpo and 2 wickets, KKR on drivers seat",5
Is Pant DC's highest paid player?,1
Swanny wtf 😂😂,6
Scott Styris chillin lol,5
Why is Shaw not playing,3
"Run rate of 6 in the PP with 2 wickets down. Wait, the batting team isn't KKR?",4
Lara thinking what has he done to deserve swann,12
Brüh pant batting at 9 off 14 in a fucking 200 chase. What the fuck is Delhi doing,3
They are enjoying too much on Dugout,10
Not looking like Pant is gonna score big today either. Hand coming off of the bat is a tell.,1
Lol Dugout is on drugs,11
Lockie back babies,1
"Unpopular opinion, as a KKR fan I'd rather we face DC instead of RCB in the playoffs",10
Panty gonna tee off soon.,3
Swann being Swanny.,5
lockie ferguson got a nice stache,1
That yoga clip by Swann felt like start of a porno,9
"Just a matter of time, once one of these gets out.",2
Swanny is as high as a kite,7
Can we have a close match today ?,3
"Absolutely Pathetic Captaincy. Cummins has gotten 2 and is on fire... why take him off attack!? 

Like I can get Smith doing it with Archer because he has only one wicket taker but Morgan has Ferguson and Narine!!!!",4
I'm really high and seeing Swanm commentate makes me question reality,6
"Take some singles, take pressure off you.",1
Dugout and Swann are the greatest thing to happen in 2020,8
I have a feeling pant and iyer will take the match away from us,4
Lara's face is like white people crazy.,10
Swann has become unmissable,4
lol that Swann yoga commentary is more entertaining that the match,5
I'm really high and seeing Swanm commentate makes me question reality,5

Pant is playing too many risky shots but with no rewards,2

Shreyas it's time tk bang Narine,1
"Spinner comes

Iyer : Aight imma take it off",3
Why is Narine wearing short sleeves today? (Especially after being reported),8
Wtf is that action narine??,7
16 off 19? What the flying fuck is this guy doing. The target isn't 85,8
The new action is unsatisfying to watch,10
I want pant to play a good innings and seal the mouths close of all the people hating on him.,7
Narine definitely wore full sleeves to mask his action. Now he’s clear he’s wearing short sleeves 🤔. Weird sight,1
So Narine has changed his action huh,6
Pant Kishan Samson all are top order batsmen & we need No.5-6 finishers. I think KL Rahul will be our full time keepers for T20Is.,11
Another new action,16
Thats injured Russel action.,12
Only people who won't earn $2.1 million in their entire lives can justify a $2.1 million payout,17
Narine without long sleeves. Must be pretty confident about his new action.,38

His previous action looked cleaner",7

Narine bowling in short sleeves is very much a 'I've got nothing to hide' move,8
Ferguson is a much much better bowler to right handers than to left handers.,7
Narine with new approach to life.,3
"Pant at 17 (23), where have I seen a left hander doing this before",2
Pant needs to come good today.,1
RCB gain from DC's loss here right?,11
NGL I am starting to like  DC theme,3
Pant targeting Ferguson absolute madlad,7
First time seeing Narine bowl in ages. He looks like a 5 year old learning how to keep his arm straight for the first time.,8
Need Pant to do a Tewetia here. He was 17 of 23 when he hit those 5 6s.,9
"KKR looks a bit more energetic, right?",3
Slower Yorker please,3
KKR's fielders look more committed today. How a good innings can lift the spirits of a team,15
"Nah i don't think even winning this will put a smile on ponting's face. 

He'd want DC to completely dominate the opposition in all areas",8
"People already discarding DC when Iyer Pant still batting and Stoin and Hetti yet to come, ok",6
Pant looking to hit every ball for a 4 or 6 and yet batting at 22*(26),7

It's with time before Ferguson goes onto to steal our spices and fly to England,9
Lockie so satisfying to watch,3
WOW. The last delivery was at 154 KMPH and right in the blockhole. Well handled by pant,17
Deli really needed to get off to a better start from the powerplay,6
23 off 27 is ridiculous when you are chasing almost 200. Pant need to unlearn all the sensible BS,10

The Ranbir Kapoor-Paresh Rawal Coke ad is competing with Download Cred Baby for the best IPL ad this season,6
"I understand how Narine got a warning for his actions, he's got one before and this time too! What's wrong is that ICC and the IPL committee is that they don't clarify what kind of ball is the issue and Narine bowls 6 of them! Good that he got things worked out for him quick enough! But some other player would have needed more time maybe even lose an year or more of his career working on the actions!

We saw how Pragyan Ojha lost everything in an year. He was no.1 bowler in tests and one issue of suspect warning and he wasn't bowler he was anymore!",17

Who do you guys see as the next LOI captain after Kohli (and Rohit) ?,0
Why is Narine bowling like my gf when I pin her hand behind her back?,-3
Pant gotta be most overhyped player i’ve seen,5
I swear I'm gonna be so upset if we end up ruining Pant which looks like it might be happening already,2
48 off 46.. this would be an amazing comeback partnership in an ODI lol,3
"I like how Narine is super confident and wearing the half sleeve shirt. 

Usually he'd be so worried about his action, he'd wear a full length shirt irrespective of how hot it is.",6

is DC trying to lose this on purpose? intent^TM missing,4

Ferguson or nortje?,1
Holy fuck that was beautiful,3
Guess now we now who's the first choice wicketkeeper for the AUS tests,7

He literally knows only 1 shot. Jump on the Ishan Kishan hype trian before its too late. We call him ishu.,10

What does a mystery spinner mean?,1

whats wrong with pant nowadays,3
Varun Chakrvarty is a gem,2
I think Pant should drop down to 5 or 6 even. He should play like a finisher role to get his confidence back up and Hetmyer is a very capable player at 4 too.,7
Is it just me or  does Chakravarthy's celebration remind you of Jesus?,4
End to a torturous inning.,3

Good chance for Ishan to play a few more good knocks this IPL and pressure the selectors to pick him ahead of Pant for the T20Is on Australia tour,2
Hetmyer making iyer dive for the laughs,3
Is it fair to call CV a mystery spinner when he only has 2-3 good balls? Why do people throw that word around with every new leg spinner who can bowl a googly?,0
West Indian Pant on the crease,8
what was that lmfao,3
at least Samson gets out without wasting as many balls.,4
By whome Russell will be replaced once he is fit?,3
Required run rate is 13 rpo and Pant played at strike rate of 80 something. LMAO,7
DC should play Pant on grounds with small leg side boundaries,4
Hetmeyer is thicc with triple Cs,3
"Hopefully next match onwards DC play Hetmyer at 4, above Pant.

He's usually batted at 3-4 for all his franchises and the national team and is a proper batsman, not just a dasher who'll give you a quick cameo. 

Show some faith in him pls.",7
"They kept criticising his natural game, and now he's joined the tuk tuk academy.",10
Can Thicc hetmyer bat better than thicc pant ?,6
A worthy successor to Dhoni.,3

[deleted],7
Varun Chakravarthy has been an underrated revelation this season,8
Almost got Iyer.,1
DC fucked us all bottom half of the table folks,9
Pant should not bat at 4 again this season. Should stick to slogging at death. Hetmyer at 4. Pant at 6 or even 7.,5
God this is some DD-esque performance from DC,3
Big Dilemma :- I want Punjab to grab the 4th spot. So want Delhi to win this. But then given how inconsistent Punjab have been what if they don't qualify and one of RR or SRH qualify. I also don't want that. Punjab first preference else I'm okay with KKR. Don't know whom to support lol.,4
If pant can't take criticism and changes his game just to please his critics; maybe he isn't made for international cricket,1
"Iyer lacks that fifth gear that better anchors have. Manish Pandey and Kohli can score at a strike rate >200 once they're say 60 off 50 balls. Iyer can destroy spinners in the middle, but in the death he can't accelerate.",6

Looks like he just immensely enjoys playing the game.",8
Delhi hasn't paced this well at all,7
Strange seeing Narine bowling with short sleeves,4
Both MS Dhoni & Rishabh Pant started as super aggressive batsman. But Dhoni's innings started becoming slow gradually. Now Pant is following the same route,2
Dhoni should come back to ODI team at least after dismal performance by these keepers,2

"Pant isn’t performing this season because he has put on a few more pounds in the lockdown and isn’t fit enough for a 23 yr old. He has to first keep and then bat in the UAE heat which will drain an unfit player quicker than a fit one imo. No stamina left, no more power hitting. He also got hamstring injury due to extra chubbiness for a WK.",10
On field umpire must be a huge fan of young Dhoni.,6
160 is a good score from here.,6
Open with stoinis. No need of rahane or pant.,3
"Struggling to hit cleanly

Edit: You're welcome",4
iiirc pant batted well with freedom when he used to bat at 3 and iyer used to open the inning. Delhi should try to repeat that. Opening isn't working any way.,2

let's hope this doesn't fuck up our nrr at least,1
That had some serious hang time.,1
Hitmyer,2
thicmyer,1
"What a poor chase, can only hope a miracle now",1
"Can't believe people are blaming Virat Kohli for messing up Pant! Pant got what not other player in Kohli's team had! A fringe player getting an extended run despite below average returns in limited overs! 

If Rayudu or Karthik got that, they would have been thanking the Gods! Not Kohli's fault and it's only his one off season!",3
He chunky,1
Pant Is destroyed by people criticizing him when he lost his wicket by hitting,3
Why can't they just play proper cricketing shots instead of mistiming everything,1
Narine's new action is funky.,5
This game is still on bois,1
What happened to Iyer's timing?,1
Every fucking player goes out of form,1
"I really like how stupidly  impulsive the whims of this sub are.  
 
If Pant gets out while playing aggressively, people whine that he can't curb his natural game.  
 
If he tries to play more conservatively, people whine that isn't playing his natural game.  
 
People some idiot jumps on me, yes I know there's a balance to be struck. But people don't advocate for the balance, the narrative swings from one extreme to the other here.",8
Woahhh,2
Lol this is over. My man Iyer already slogging.,4
"If Hetmayer plays as many balls as Pant, we may be close to the target",2
"Guys Pant aint fully fit, you can see that from his movement. The reason why he is playing now is because if he doesn't play, the team balance is really screwed.",4
Hetmeyer’s ass tho,2
"Rahane shouldn't even be in the IPL, let alone in an IPL playing XI.  He's ruining not just the chances of the team he plays, but he also is ruining his test career fiddling with his technique to become a T20 batsman.",3
Iyer is turning into Manish Pandey very fast. Please someone do something.,0
"So why did Pant make a solid 27(33), KKR bowled really well or Pant was playing a ""sensible"" innings?",3
Finally. Hitmeyer,1
"Seedhi baat, no bakwaas. Hit sixes. More Indian cricketers need to learn this. Manish Pandey played such an innings the other day",-1
As a Kings XI fan just hopinh Delhi doesn't lose too bad and help KKR recover the net run rate,5
"Hetmyer, Pant and Shaw. All young players from DC but doesn't seem to be at their peak fitness wise.",9
RRR over 14 now,1
heytmr has a beer belly ?,2
Catch me if you can,1
Indian spinners are fuckin shite fielders,1
"KKR win: RCB top 2 finish becomes more likely
DC win: RCB lite qualification becomes more likely 

Literally a win-win today",5
"Heytmyer: Watch my booty
Upmire: Hold my hair clip",8
Varun Chakravarthy is the poorest fielder in the KKR squad.,1
Why Chakarvathy was taking the catch,1
Hetmeyer should be in at 4 over Pant,6
oh fuckkoff,2
"Pant was good while being a wild unpredictable player. This maturity shit aint for him, needs to drop it asap",-1
Imagine having Hetmyer batting like this but still not playing him at 4. DCs think tank missed a trick.,-1
Hetmyer has a thicc ass,1
So it's pretty much curtains for us?,3
"Mandatory comment by commentator-

Did he just dropped the ball or he dropped the MaTcH?!",3
"No need to be mad at a fielder for missing your catch if you miss your own catch.

Just Chakravarthy things",7
Hetmyer wanted to hit that ball to the next country,5
Reminder that Item is 47 off 37 in a 200-run chase...,0
Well at least he tried,3
Great going Chakraborty,4
Intent is best wicket taker,3
One day when you want DC to win they do this smh,11
Varun keeping smart score in mind,2
Tripathi is an excellent fielder. Seen him in a few games now,6
My boy VC! He is the real deal!,7
Chakra is like *I Am Number 1*,4
good catch.,3
was a tough one,5
Goodbye NRR,3
hetmeryer's ass: chef's kiss,3
Pant and Shikar should open followed by Iyer and Hetmyr,2
Rcb fans must be fucking ecstatic,5
"Player having one bad season after being top scorer for last 2 seasons.

r/cricket- he has become tuk tuk,why not replace him with much inconsistent playerw.",6
Come on kkr. Bring that dc nRR down.,2
"Hetmyer did nothing wrong,  he had to do what needed to be done, RIP Delhi",6
"**13.2** Varun to Hetmyer, OUT,  **95-4**

SO Hetmyer c Tripathi b Varun 10 (5b 0x4 1x6) SR: 200.00",2
Win KKR win,3
Delhi doing Delhi things 😭,3
Moti gaand players fucking us in the gaand today,9
So he was worth that 8cr+ contract,9
Pant and Hetmyer both flopped today. Vaughan should by in tears lol.,3
Hit-and-runmeyer,3
I can't believe this guy Varun used to work a normal office job a year ago. What a bowler!,8
This Indian side from Delhi side does not have that believe factor which a winner or experienced player always have. Pant in last IPL seasons showed that but this season he has been poor and god knows why he changed his style. DC needs a good experienced player in mid or they will just keep getting out during knockouts.,4
Hetmyer has been a massive disappointment this season,0
"Delhi always shows promise at the beginning of the tournament and dissapoints at the end. 

Try getting all the shit out of your system in the beginning for once",8
Lara looks sad today.,1
4D chess by Varun misfielding the previous ball to get the danger Hitmyer out,2
"Hetmeyer should've start coming in at 4 though, doesn't waste ball",2
Wait wtf,2
Pant-Iyer innings will cost DC this match.. both playing anchor innings at the same time.. smh,2
"BC Tushar is out, make Pant sit out like Shaw and score more in middle overs rather than tuk tuk",3
Come on dc why you gotta give me hope,6
It's hard being a DD fan.,14
Lol wtf is happening,11
gg,7
BGB- Big gaand boys,2
Chakra is truly number 1,8
Sunil Narine's action is identical to my bowling action when I was 10.,11
Yes kill their NRR,12
Is this boundary way too big or something?,5
Lol,3
Is the ground too big??,0
F,3
Stoinis 80(30) loading,6
Brain dead from Iyer there. Why would you do that,11
Bruh!!,5
I will take the Blue Pill thankyou,1
Gg it’s over,5
At least Hetmyer tried,5
wtf Shreyass!!!,1
Varun Chakravarthy is a terrific spinner. What a find for KKR. But he really needs to work on his fielding skills massively.,8
My boy Varun on a HATTY!,6
Ponting going to have an aneurysm.,9
How high is Chakravarty ?,10
Iyer got hopeless I feel.,7
Unbelievable,4
"Stop, I can only get so aroused",7
"We lose, we throw the NRR, we get pit of top 2, perfect day for us lmao",4
Destroy their NRR KKR(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ,15
Was Varun sledging Shreyas?,4
Lmao Varun with the sendoff.,3
"Question of the hour, how we gonna include Russell in this team next?",3
"Big holes in batting. Horrific captaincy from Iyer with poor field placements and bowling changes. No he is NOT a good captain, no matter what reddit says. The last 2 matches have been testament for that.",3
Hoping DC don't do a kxip and make chakravarthy report for sus bowling,3
"DC : causes collapse of KKR while chasing 228

KKR: Uno reverse baby",4
Lol Chak with that Namaste,3
So the top 4 spots sealed now?,4
Six or out ATM,5
Ayo lmao why did you do that Varun,11
Varun has been a revelation this season.,6
Iyer did not like that namaste one bit hehe,19
Rahane better with the ball than the bat it seems,1
Did he just give him a send-off?,9
Game over,2
I hope Stoinis performs in the way he never has for Australia,2
Cmon Chakra was that send off really necessary?,9
DC trying to loose this so bad! They don't want kxip in playoffs for sure!!,4
"**13.3** Varun to Iyer, OUT, and he is on a hat-trick **95-5**

SS Iyer c Nagarkoti b Varun 47 (38b 5x4 0x6) SR: 123.68",3
Ooo what did iyer say to varun?,8
Unnecessary send-off,3
Changing the flair to Delhi Daredevils in honour of our effort today.,5
That drop by Varun was 4d chess. It was a dot ball in disguise,10
Save the NRR somehow...,2
Chakaravarthy gave Iyer a send off! kind of mean,7
Let us take second position. Do it for RCB,6
No way Sunil Narine should be bowling in professional cricket anymore  such an obvious chucker,4
"Varun Chakravarthy added to that list of unexpected performances, starting with Siraj",5
"Delhi loses and punjab is probably finished too. Fuck, my 2 favorite teams.",7
Kings XI  again will have to rescue this season with a tight game tonight.  Last few games have been unwatchable,4
How the hell did Corky hear DK tell Varun C it's sticking in the pitch when they almost exclusively talk in Tamil only,7
Rahane lookalike >>>>> rahane,9
"Lmao, what was that sendoff? Jeez",6
Atleast we won't play for NRR like some other teams.,1
Hey look its the Delhi Daredevils,3
MY GOD RCB NRR LOOKING MIGHTY GOOD NOW LMAO,7
Wait why is Shaw not in the 11?,2
I can sense SRH and punjab fans crying in the corner like anything.,6
Welp my delhi friends. It's been real but we've shit the bed yet again. See you next year. And Ambani ki poonani .,7
Varun C chopping this middle order,8
Sorry kxip and srh fans,9
"Thanks agent KKR.

Regards

Every RCB fan.",13
If KKR win this and SRH fuck up next...then IPL done for me as a SRH fan. Cannot rely on luck as this is 2020,1
"Well we had our fun this tournament. Now we need some serious retrospection. If we lose the remaining 3 matches (and we may as we will play MI, RCB and SRH), we may be out of it.",3
Good guys KKR giving us 2 big wins and now damaging delhis Nrr,5
"These two hits showed us how big the boundary is and that just makes Narine and Rana's innings even better. Or in other words,it makes Ashwin's bowling look even worse.",4
"I like the DC fans who's screaming ""yeah Intent"" when they're probably gonna lose by a big margin now!",2
That's it for Punjab then? I don't see them winning 3 games,5
100 off 39 lmao,2
DC needs to keep faith in Prithvi Shaw he will either give you start full of fireworks or get out without wasting many balls!,5
"Varun ""Sunil Narine"" Chakravarthy",2
Cmon dude really? Atleast we thought we had NRR advantage over KKR. Now Delhi is spreading wide to KKR in that too,5
"Chakraverhty, KArthik and Iyer are all from the same community",-3
I don't see DC qualifying for playoff,3
Ponting flanked by Kaif and Dahiya. Didn't think I'll see this trio together ever in my life. You gotta love the IPL.,7
~~Iyer~~ ~~Pant~~ ~~Hetmyer~~ Stoinis to do a Tewatia,14
Axar Patel 80(30) incoming,4
Braindead.exe got executed,4
Hetmyer has escape completely throughout the season except one match. I don't think Delhi even has any middle order replacement.,2
"Don't do that Harsha, Don't give us hope",3
Shreyas got a send off. Lol. Hopefully that'll fire him up for coming matches. This is awful stuff from DC.,6
DC Killed two birds with one stone.,11
"DC prepared for Lockie Ferguson, but Varun Chakravarthy came out of syllabus.",5
"That's why Shaw is a viable option, he is the only dude who could hit at a sr >150 in the top 4 when Dhawan was out of form",5
[deleted],3
"Indian batsmen in the 90s and 00s used to be great batsmen of spin, Not anymore.",8
Pretty sure Iyer could understand everything Karthik and Varun were saying,4
[deleted],3
Need a big Poinis Stoinis inning,1
"Even if DC loses this, I hope they end in top 2  by the end of league matches.",-2
Which team is this? Am I watching some old match replay?,9
Reminds me of 2019 when we looked well set for a Top 2 Finish and then a huge loss vs MI dented us pretty bad,5
Any idea what Shreyas Iyer said to VC,5
"That Pant-Iyer partnership pretty much killed the chase.
Cmon a 63(53) chasing almost 200.",4
Varun is cheeky lol,7
wtf was that Chakravarthy. Not cool at all.,9
only 1 catching fielder for the hattrick ball? weak,1
Loving Dk's Banter with Varun in Tamil! Delhi is clueless wtf is being conspired.,15
Ooh fellow tambram shade,6
GoodBye SRH,3
DC already into playoffs right?,3
It was a matter of time. Not sure what was the plan from the beginning while chasing 190+ score.,2
Absolutely fucked them in the ass good. This is a huge upset honestly if KKR win this.,6
Varun CV making KXIP pay,10
I remember Stoinis playing a finisher’s knock against Blackcaps. Can he do it here?,5
Varun with a sanskari send-off there lol,12
"~~Spider-Man~~ DC was a ~~hero~~ shit team, I just couldn't see it.",4
lol Chakravarthy wasn't definitely saying well played,2
I didn't know Abu Dhabi cricket stadium also had sabji mandis @DineshKarthik,5
Easy easy boi. Feck off,0
KKR is winning cuz DK is shouting more than Pant,9
"/r/Cricket, I find your lack of faith in Lord Axar disturbing",10
This kills kxip,4
Didn’t see the first innings. Axar went only for 7 runs in his only over. Why wasn’t he bowled the other 3? Deshpande  and Ashwin got tonked. Still no Axar overs.,4
One bad match and DC fans be like.. we are not qualifing for playofffs. Lol. Get your shit together guys.,15
"Delhi couldn't bear the expectations of 4 fanbases on them, understandable",8
Turns out DC were DD in disguise all along.,4
Bc game over. Karma biting me back in ass- I have made lots of fun of CSK.,8
"RCB fans: ""Yesss kill them. Let the hate flow through you...""",10
"If KKR wins this it will more or less confirm the top 4, right?",6
At this point I'd take a 30 run loss,3
SRH and KXIP can still catch up.... to DC,3
"Fraud Chakravarty will get slaughtered against AB, Pollard etc",-7
I’ll never not appreciate a good send off. Cricket needs some spicy send offs to offset the whole “wholesome” business.,9
Chakravrthy seems to have gained weight. He's chunky now,2
"Can anobody translate some of what DK way saying to Varun? I don't speak Tamil, but would love to know.",2
Lol Varun is getting nowhere close to the national team if he does this to the future captain,3
[deleted],2
"Kkr giving us 2pts and nrr and taking DC's 2pts and nrr

Thank you guys",8
The rest of the ipl would be spoiled after this match as the chances of other two teams aiming for the last spot go down.,3
Is there a possibility that all other teams except MI end up on 14 points and the 3 spots are decided by NRR? or no?,1
Instead of getting Ashwin back in white ball team let's give Chakravarty a chance he will do us good for 2 yrs like Kuldeep untill the Marleen Machine decodes him too ❤️,3
Wont mind going out guns blazing,3
Hetmyer is such a useless player in these clutch situations. Never pulls through,2
"Oh dear , what happened in the hour that I was away?

DC have to play for NRR now, even the Hulk won't be able to do this with the final guy who can bat with him at the crease.",5
"I dont think the pitch has changed much from the 1st innings. KKR also didn't bowl anything out of the ordinary, just bad batting by DC",4
Imagine sending stoinis at 6,5
We ded 😭 ✌️ see you next season Bois,5
"Cmon guys, will by 50 runs",3
[deleted],2
"Ashwin getting tonked, and his team likely losing? Love to see it.",2
"Varun: Thank you for that easy wicket boss  
Us: So disrespect|Rude|Mean|What was that",9
Why is narine not wearing a full sleeve t-shirt today?,1
69mts six. Nice,0
Axar gonna take a payback for his bowlers,1
Nice six,1
Yes 15 more of that,1
That Axarshot was way better than whatever Pant was doing,4
So looks like our hopes were ephemeral,-1
Axar >>>>>> Pant,1
This action change is really hurting Narine,7
Narine with his minimal effort bowling action,3
[deleted],1
"Do they keep narine in future matches only for his ""batting skills""",9
"So I guess the luck has finally run out then?

This feels so similar to last year. Decent start. Almost make top 2. Fall just short. Fuck up playoffs.

I know there's still matches to go, but the past few games have been disappointing performances. Other than Dhawan.",8
This is getting dangerous.,1
Narine’s action looks sus,1
Delhi Capitals should release the video of today’s post-match team talk by Ponting.  Would love to see it.,22
[deleted],7
"Fan of Kolkata after this! 





They are making DC look like CSK now",8
Dont worry guys.. kxip is going beat kkr and get everyone back in the race...,5
MI is winning this season too. Isn’t it?,2
"Fan of Kolkata after this! 





They are making DC look like CSK now",9
"Delhi may well not even make playoffs bcz their next 3 matches are against SRH, MI and RCB. Even they lose against SRH they it may get very interesting.",4
"looks like kxip,rr,srh will play for the 5-6-7th position only now 😂 kkr running away with their luck",1
"Speaking of stoinis, what even happened to zampa? It's like be disappeared",6
Gosh DK needs to shut up,4
Narine 101*,2
Why is Stoinis not trying to hit?,1
Just to the people who's saying Delhi fans are crying. We are crying for top two slots. We know we are shit in the playoff and doesn't want the repeat of 2009.,7
"I dont want KKR in playoffs, need punjab to give the other teams a good fight!",1
"Mathematically, there still is a chance that DC doesn't make top 4. Would love to see that lmao.",12
This Delhi batting line-up is deep. They may be slightly out of form as a unit but it'll be very vital in playoffs if they make it.,3
"DK: HOWAZZAAT

umpire: not out

DK: why.",20
DK  badly needs a mouth gag to stop him talking.,6
If Narine doesn’t Chuck then he is very much hitable,-6
Axar Patel can still take them home,3
Didn't Rana use to bowl?,2
I like Paschim Pathak's smooth movements. Yes.,3
"West Indies fans probably dont have these shitty fights like Pooran > Hetty and stuff, I only see stuff like this with Indian fans",3
"Even if DC can't win here, they can pad their NRR. Perfect situation. Lose by ~20 runs instead of 60 runs",3
Being the one backing Pant hurts 😭,1
"Reminder that KXIP bought Varun for over 8 cr, gave him one over to bowl to the most aggressive opener against spin (Narine), and offloaded him.",9
"Eminently doable for DC. 

Just 17 rpo for 5 overs with 5 wickets.",4
Game,1
"Kings XI still have a chance if they win out, they play KKR on Monday",6
Architect is on 🔥,4
"Why is everyone saying that that this seals the playoff spots, wtf? If SRH and KXIP don't lose any of their games going forward, and KKR lose one, then all will finish on 16 points.  
 
If SRH or KXIP lose, they're pretty much out, true. But that would be case even if KKR lost today.",6
What a brain dead shot,3
Stoinis malding,5
tag yourself I’m the camera not finding the ball,3
Thank you DC/KKR. Very cool.,8
Chakra cutting DC in half.,5
Replay,3
Imagine varun taking 4 wickets and sunil narine being beaten for sixes lol,3
Varun took out 3 biggest hitters. Insane,5
KKR will increase their nrr after this match too,4
Last two matches from DC doesn't make them look like they are top of the table. They are peaking in the wrong direction!,3
gg guys see ya next game,1
"You guys wank off to the big Stoin's physique when things are fine, but you don't support this sex God and Lord Axar in their toughest hour? Smh unbelievable.

Edit: Alright, I fucked DC",2
Don’t remember the last time Ashwin got spanked so hard,1
Chakravarthy spinning a web. Narine regen,4
Why do we keep giving Tushar and Rahane the chances?,3
Helllooooo it's the Varoon and DK show. DC got a mouthful of it haha!,2
Lol idk where they got these cameramen but they constantly lose sight of the ball.,4
"You're welcome, RCB and MI",7
VC came out of the syllabus.,3
Gg bois,1
I find it a bit hilarious that instead of tying it as a ponytail that umpire is fabulously spread his hair over the shoulders. Metrosexual icon,11
"KKR's batting just needs to click on a consistent basis.  Their bowling is pretty strong, especially when defending a total.",7
I want DC to release Ponting's dressing room speech following this game.,11
Chakravarthy omg,6
Why does Varun look stoned even after getting wickets?,6
Ball be like - Wherever I go I see Tripathi,11
"Now Axar also available as No.7 option for Team India what is your preference

* Jadeja
* Krunal
* Tewatia
* Sundar
* Axar
* Ashwin
* Specialist bowler",2
I don't mind KKR winning this match. This gives more opportunity for RCB to be in top 2. Lol.,5
Excellent move of saving Varun for the end!,2
Marcus should swap his place with Pant for better utilisation of bowlers.,4
Should have reviewed that looked like it was hitting leg stump,5
Yeah blame them why can't they score 17 runs in every overs.,3
Varun Chakravarthy to take a 7-fer Ackermann today!! U heard it first here,7
Varunalitharan,3
GO KKR GO,4
"**15.1** Varun to Stoinis, OUT, No. 4 for Varu. The legcutter is turning enough to do the DC hitters in **110-6**

MP Stoinis c Tripathi b Varun 6 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",1
What's unique about VC that everyone is skying him?,4
"Chakravarty is a nice bowler for KKR, plays over international bowler Kuldeep and picks crucial wickets",4
KKR helping MI despite us beating y’all everytime. Thanks guys,12
"Delhi Capitals players are in a hurry to watch El Clasico, starting at 7:30 pm IST.",5
Ah here's the Stoinis that played for RCB.,15
Wooohooo Quali 1 here we goo,3
"Timeout, just to make sure they don't lose ad money",3
"why are they calling VC mystery spinner, he has been really good with the ball this season.",3
SRH and KXIP: Why we still play? Just to suffer?,12
"Poor Pant is gonna get a shitstorm of criticism for his innings today, soaking up a quarter of the innings for 27 runs. Was it the right move to send him ahead of Stoinis and Hetmyer?

Now I reckon we should appreciate Narine and Rana's innings in hindsight now, wasn't the easiest pitch on which one could clear the boundaries.",18
DC prepared for Narine but forgot about Chakravarthy,12
"So the last few games have been boring. Don't worry lads, we are on tonight to provide entertainment",6
CSK wanted this 1 match to go their way and then this happens.,7
My favourite team - KKR. LOL,4
Tripati has a teleportation pad? How come he’s everywhere?,4
I'd rather lose like this than finish with a 150/5 after the full 20 overs,1
I was actually delusional enough to think these fucks could compete for the title lol.,5
"Last year too, we stumbled towards the end of the league stages. And looks like we will continue the tradition",0
Chakravarthy might get a call for Indian T20 squad. He’s been loads impressive than Kuldeep or Jadeja anyway.,8
VC killing it,3
"KKR giving proper payback after that sorry 84 run performance against RCB. 

Btw what is Varun Chakraborty doing????",3
"Absolute Morgan masterclass this, build pressure at the top with controlled pacers, holding the spinners back to pick up wickets when they start to go hard",6
After that Super over match. All matches have been one sided. Not good for IPL. Surely we're gonna have next year IPL in india no matter what.,6
"I told ya, i told ya Stoinis is overrated.",1
"As a DC fan, think I have jinxed it. If DC loses all its remaining matches, what is the probability it will make to playoffs?",2
Top4 are pretty much decided. I don't see any miracle happening. Unless script writers want to make things interesting and not boring from here.,2
I don't think delhi is playing win the match from here. They aren't even trying. Most likely they are aware of NRR,1
Chakra is just 1 wicket away from that fifer.,3
sandpaper banter,2
Lol at least watch the ball you guys. Just swinging from the hip smh.,2
"Kudos to KKR for giving Chakravarthy a second look even after a terrible game last year. In many cases, one bad game for a new spinner, and they're out. See the examples of Prayas Ray Burman and Shivil Kaushik.",7
[removed],2
Varun Dhawan will become the first choice spinner for India soon,7
"On a serious note, is pant playing cautiously coz people were criticising him for throwing his wicket away? I mean that's good, he needs to value his wicket but that doesn't mean he doesn't even show his natural instinct to hit bad balls. He has X factor to his batting that makes him different. I hope he realises that soon otherwise that would be a waste of potential",5
Now dc and rcb will compete for 2nd place if a three top teams get same points (like last year),4
People saying KKR will almost confirm their spot in top 4 if they win today. They'll still need to win 2 of their next 3 matches otherwise KXIP or SRH can reach 14 and beat them by NRR.,9
Punjab seething with rage right now,6
Chakravarty with nearly Siraj-esque figures,9
Rest in Peace the redemption arc of KXIP. Fun while it lasted.,10
DC batsman forgot how to hit 4s,7
Bc Saturday morning ruined.,11
Did the daredevils possess the capitals this game,2
"Dugout has gaming chairs, nice!",3
Stoinis finally playing like stoinis.,6
4 teams depended on Delhi today so they suddenly performed like Delhi Daredevils instead of Delhi Capitals.,13
"Imo Even though the bowling shat, Pants dreadful innings cost the game",5
[deleted],9
"Dammit, just realised that this means that the 4th place spot is slipping further and further away from teams like KXIP, SRH and maybe even RR. KKRhave almost sealed their spot and their newly boosted NRR will help them.",6
Are the venues for playoffs announced?,1
Shreyas Iyer got everything wrong today from scratch to end. Poor captaincy in every domain.,1
Swanny keeping the sandpaper alive.,3
"As a spinner, it beggars belief to me that someone can bowl at 105 kmph and still get some turn.",2
DK as a keeper is also good at directing spinners,4
"If kxip win today, it'll set up a mouthwatering 4th spot scramble on Monday and I can't fucking wait for it. KKR vs KXIP will basically decide the 4th spot. Sweet!",3
Shit batting from our team,3
East coast US,1
Lmao Ponting still pissed with Ashwin. He promoted KG over him in the batting order.,8
"I think it's clear now that DC won't win the cup. Their batting does not have the lethality factor like MI with Pollard, RCB with Kohli-AB, or KXIP with Gayle-Pooran.

It's possible their bowling might steal them some wins, but it's a weak chance.",2
Rabada 52(19) and we can do it!!,4

A 5 haul pretty cool,3
[deleted],3
Hahahahaha Axar looks befuddled.,3
"Reminds me of the CSK vs DC game at Chennai last year.CSK had a negative NRR and DC had a positive NRR before that game Lot of things happened in that game. 

CSK batted first and went on to post 179 after being 7-1 after 4 overs.
Axar Patel getting Watto for the nth time.
Dhoni, Jadeja Carting Boult and Morris to all corners.
Delhi getting to 50 in quick time with Dhawan and Iyer in 5 overs. 
Then it was a procession with Tahir and Jadeja sharing 7 wickets in between them and getting all out for 99.
Iyer the lone batsmen with a 44.

CSK won the game by 80 runs and the NRR flipped and CSK got to positive and then ended up pushing DC to the eliminator all thanks to this one game!

KKR might have made way for RCB similarly here.",8

VC did Tewatia with the ball,4
"**15.5** Varun to Patel, OUT, that's the five-for. The wrong'un this time. Hits the top of off. The first five-for for KKR since Narine did it in 2012. Seems like Axar has picked the wrong'un and is looking to make room and hit it over the off side, but he has been done in completely by the flight first and then the turn. the first five-for of this IPL **112-7**

Damn this guy Varun is just impressive today. 12 for 5 in 3 overs.,3

After this match I can comfortably say that MI seems to be the only settled team this IPL....,4
Give Cummo the next over so that he can get a 5-fer too pls,6
Specialist bowler op,3
DC has the best lineup for spin on paper. Gets unraveled by spin. It's about time out batsman gets exposed that the bowlers has been carrying the team.,3
Well DC has let both SRH and KXIP down here,5
"Chakravarthy having one of the best moment of his life, well played 👏.",6
This is why you always play on your strengths instead of your opponent's weaknesses. DC should have chosen to bat,8
Delhi Capitals are such morons,1
Delhi missed a trick by not bowling Axar,2
Chakravarthy for MOTM anyone? I know game was over before he took some of his wickets but how rare is a 5fer,7
"Mr. Architect.

For Delhi bowler Narine happened

For Delhi batsman Varun Chakraborty happened

Edit: Cummins also happened. He got Dhawan out.",5
Wonder who's gonna get Man of the Match. VC for me!,5
"and Iyer not bowled his spinners, and here VC picked a fifer",4
Ashwin just got cunted by Narine on the exact same surface. This is something else from Varun.,8
wtf is this ipl even. this team literally got 84 allout in the last game and is now running through the 2nd best team???,4
"Chakravarthy has one more over left, and he already took a 5-fer. Damn boy.",6
I think it's time for some ethics. This thrashing does not comply with the principles of an ethical cricketer,1

"This has been a template for DC's batting this season. There top order doesn't take responsibility after eating so many balls. When Dhawan took the responsibility, he finished the match for DC easily. It doesn't surprise me that they have lowest run rate in power play. Time for some experiment. Send Patel at the top. Take the advantage of powerplay. Drop hetmyer, he is been shit so far anyway, play keemo Paul you will have one more bowling option and do you not have to waste rabada over between 7-15.",4
MoTM vrooom?,2
Cummins hattrick pls,6
"Axar ""I will only hit out of form spinners"" Patel",6
"Instead of playing cricket, young spinners need to get their carrom skills in order",3
Good bowling but it does really help when you start bowling when the opposition needs almost 14 runs an over for the last 9. Even though big slogging will gift you wickets he's done very well not to go for any boundaries in between.,2
Shit. I wanted KKR to lose and KXIP to win today. I want to see Punjab in top 4. Not today I guess.,2
"Past performances mat Jana  Shreyas, Sahi hey bhai",7

Maybe Chakravarthy has a dick too big to use? What else could explain his enigmatic sadness.,7
Come On Cummins. Clear the tail up.,3
I want Chakravarty to get rest of the wickets.,5

Kkr to dc = main ye karleta hoon aap dream11 pe team banaiye,5
"Didn’t watch pant bat, what’s gone wrong with him?",3
By how much runs DC need to lose here to go below RCB?,6
DC obviously should focus on NRR and try to bridge that as much as they can,2
I appreciated the bowling by Chakarabharty when I first saw him ball. He is hard to read so he was economical as per IPL standards. He deserved this feat.,3
What will be KKR's NRR if they win by say 70 runs.,3
"So man of the match, Narine for his batting or Chakravarty for his bowling?",5
Just give Cummins the 5-fer godammit,2
DC after giving hope. Please do not fuck with your fans. Do the required changes in the batting order. This ain't working,3
KKR steals NRR from the rich (DC) and gives to the poor (RCB),9
I am just so happy today!,5
Scenes if DC don’t qualify,11

Yaaaa Ashwin get some batting practice before Australia tour,2
A fifer and yet Chakravarthy's face has the look of a man who picked Rahane as his Dream11 captain.,16
CSK for the love of god please smash RCB somehow tomorrow.,2
Narine's knock changed the game imo.,5
DC started off brilliantly and they have now lost 2 in 2. Ashwin is kind of familiar with this script.,3
Former no1 all-rounder boys,4
Atleast keep their nnr below us panchod,7
DC bowlers always rescue them. Sad the batting couldn’t be there for their bowlers on their bad day,7
Brett Lee gets numb talking about Cummins bowling. He went 10 matches for 3 wickets. If not for 2 million dollars he would have been dropped. 😭😂😭😂,2
So who's fucked now that KKR is winning dis?,3
All the trash talk on RCB nrr at the start of the season is looking mighty stupid now,4
People only look at 15cr and criticize but without Cummins KKR would have no bowling attack,8
Overconfident and toxic Delhi fans are gonna be so salty today.,9

"Why would you bowl first in a day game on a slowing pitch with no chance of dew?

Because DC logic!

Why would you not even try Axar once because all bowlers are getting fucked anyway?

Because DC logic!

Wasting Rabada at the end?

Persistent Delhi logic!

Oh but we did change Rahane for Shaw you know!

Yeah but now because Rahane got out first ball to a ball which would have 100% got Shaw out too, we will go back to Shaw again!

Also, we are trying to convert Pant to Dhoni and failing spectacularly as expected too.

Absolutely no way we win anything with this kind of dumb shit every game. We were actually good enough to win despite a competent management. Imagine us with some brains!",5

But that KXIP-KKR match where KXIP were absolutely cruising is gonna be the difference. 

8 wickets in hand. Reqd run rate at 6, absolutely no way they should have lost that. Pooran plays a hack, team management send the young keeper. Maxwell misses the six by inches.",20

We're not just losing but improving KKRs nrr in the process. Jeez,11
"KKR absolutely destroyed us, we seriously have to get our shit sorted",19
KKR is so unpredictable. I won't be surprised if Russell finds form in the playoffs.,27
"Its a repeat of last year in the best case: we will limp along to the playoffs and get knocked out before the finals.

Worse case: we don’t even make the play offs.

We don’t play like a champion team so i don’t care even if we win the whole thing at this point to be honest. We don’t deserve to!",12
RCB now has a good shot @ NO 2.,13
KKR NRR- -0.4.  increased by 50%. Thanks DC,31
"Eoin Morgan, solid meme captainship",11
"DC just dont have the batting anymore. Pant and Stoinis are struggling with the pitches slowing down, Iyer is ok at best. Its all on Dhawan, Ashwin, Nortje, Rabada, Axar.",22
what happened between iyer and varun?,19
What's our NRR now?,9
"For MI, I’ll take RCb anyday for Q1, over DC. 

I’ll also take KKR for the Eliminator if it comes to that Lolol",14
Teams exposing DC's weakness just like DC exposing my anger issues.,25
[deleted],10
"Thanks for fucking up DC’s NRR, Kolkata. Might make the race for 4th boring but also makes the race for top 3 interesting.",18
"People here trying to defend pant by saying the critics are going hard on him imagine if he played during Australia's mental disintegration era, dude wouldn't even last 1 tour",16
"Just to put MI's NRR in perspective, they need to lose by 250+ runs to even get 0.0",22
"We can't chase anything above 160 with our batting form. And of we keep having bad captaincy days, this year is slowly turning out to be just another year. But as DC fan, this is familiar feeling so not heart breaking tbh.",17
pls csk let us go to 1st tomorrow,2
DC NET RUN RATE halved thanks KKR,14
[removed],3
"Won't be surprised if KXIP wins all of their next matches to move to 16 points. KKR has matches against CSK and RR apart from KXIP, so they can go to 16 points too. If DC can't win against SRH next match, their last 2 games are against RCB and MI. If they lose them, they will be stuck at 14 and will be out of playoffs. I know there are a lot of ifs here but very likely outcomes.",14
"KKR win is the first outright win for a side batting first since Delhi Capitals' 13-run win against Rajasthan Royals in Dubai on 14 Oct, ten days ago. (Stat: Deepu Narayan from Twitter)",10
"DC changes its opening batsman.

Opening partnership: OH MAN, OH GOD, OH MAN, OH GOD......",4
Where are those DC fans who thought this team is better than MI?😂😂😂,17
[deleted],6
Suddenly top 2 contest is more fierce than the contest for 4th position,12
"Narine has to be man of the match.

After being dropped for so many games due to the rules which cater the batriarchy and thrashing the one of the best bowling attacks in the tournament and earning the imp 2 points for his side.",20
I just realized Varun gave that send off to Shreyas because he smashed him in the first encounter in Sharjah,17
"DC's batting shortcomings first came to the fore during the Chennai game itself, where Mr. Fuxalot Axar Patel got them over the line somehow",14
Kohli : DC BC,12
"Has a table topper with Ashwin, Axar and Stonis in playing 11 shit the bed and failed to qualify before?",15
Just entered the thread. How did Pat Cummins get 3 for 17?,9
"People talk about the team learning lol. Are you kidding me guys?

Literally last game Gayle and Pooran taught these guys how to do a chase correctly and they literally CSK’ed the chase today. Like wtf was the run a ball in the first 10 overs. By the time even Hetmyer was in, the match was already gone.

We don’t learn shit. It’s rinse and repeat the same shit.

They will even bring back Shaw next game to prove the point lol.",13
Player of the match? Nitish Rana vs Sunil Narine vs Varun Chakravarthi?,1
The players of this match were indeed in a hurry to watch the El Clasico.,11
"They said only change is permanent.

DC *changed* the opening batsman. But Opening woes are *permanent.*",13
"If life makes you a Varun, be Chakaravarthy, not Dhawan!

If you have not, please do watch his post-match interview with Harsha Bhogle",14
Is there any reason Mayank isn’t playing? I just turned the match on and I’m surprised to see mandeep out there,2
Why did Stoinis bowl 4 overs? He's always expensive and Russell destroyed him twice last season.,5
Only positive from this. Law of averages will eventually catch up. We've won enough and now losing enough. Hopefully we'll win when it matters in the playoffs.,8
Missed the match. How tf this happened?! I thought dc was good and kkr wasn't doing all that great?,4
Why is KL wearing a black armband?,5
"Looking for a lesson on how to waste a batsman? 

See Delhi’s use of Hetmyer in the last 2 games!",13
"DC at disadvantage, MI and RCB play against RR and CSK :P",9
Tell me when Swanny comes on,2
"Holy shit, Varun got 5 for 20. Well deserved MotM",11
Jason Holder Tinder notifications must always be blinking ...,0
"At the end of the day, all I can say is thanks KKR for the Durga Puja gift",7
 Thank goodness,0

"Gayle out for 20(20)
 Just 2020 things.",2
We are fucking tragic. Notice the extra pressure due to no extra batsman,2
Do you guys not know there's something called non lofted 4s,1
Only Pooran can shave this sinking ship.,0
"Yeah so then tell me, how much of this could have been avoided if Gayle opened??? Fucking idiots",3
Maxwell is eating five star and doing nothing.,4
Today's games have been boring af,3
Can never get tired of that Mishraji video,7
What does the physio spray on the nutsack for such injuries?,5
Oh shit. Hope he is fine.,3
Varun Chakravathy is the cutest,4
