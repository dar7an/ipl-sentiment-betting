Hope srh wins so that DC vs rcb is a fight for #2,3
Please RCB win - top 2,3
Warner you got a gift from dc on your birthday as a win. Can you return gift us by losing today so that kohli has a chance to play on his birthday on 5th November. Plisss.,4
perfect time for a classic virat-ab 200 run partnership,3
"I'm done with these injuries üòí I hope we lose not more than 1 player to injury in this match. Saha and shankar missing this match will be double blow. Hopefully Williamson is fit, At least. I can't bet my life on fuckin bairstow again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",3
Rcb to top,2
Whoever starts getting into some kind of form gets injured in our team ... Hard luck :(,14
"I want SRH to win this not that we currently have a top4 worthy team with all these injuries, but I hated the bully kohli was to SKY, there is a line between aggression and bully.",-15

"RCB - SRH matches always had some banger moments over the last 4 years and I'd expect nothing less today.

Remember these two have never won both matches against each other in a single season so there's that going for us.",40
One more loss to srh and one more injury?,2

"If we somehow get virat out before rashid's spell starts , we'll easily win this

Otherwise koach can easily score by 1's and 2's against him and rashid wont be as economical as he usually is and wont get any wickets as well",8
I think RCB should send shivam dube as 3 because usually rcb score 45 - 50 runs in powerplay  and lose a wicket but in the middle  over kholi nor ab take risks because after them the batting order is weak.. So the run rate in the middle over gets low. Shivam dube could be used a Sunil Narine. Just go out there and try to hit everything. If it works then it works otherwise he was anyway gonna do the same thing when he would come at 16 or 17 over... It's gamble but it could work well.. It worked in the indian team,1
I love my telugu bros but fuck SRH today,28

Good guy dc finished the match soon so that we can see the toss,114
"If SRH wins this, we'll have four teams at 12 points, with RCB and DC stranded at 14. And then RCB plays DC next. Which means it will be guaranteed that one of RCB and DC stays stuck at 14 points, and from there on it's all up to NRR. 

Note: this is provided SRH wins today.",5

Well guys i won 2 Reddit coins for the last match prediction... Let's zoooooo..,2
"Okay so now we're down to a very few fixtures. 
Here's what the points table will look if the following results play out. It will make stuff really exciting and open until the very last fixture in the league stage.

1) SRH beats RCB [to keep the tournament open]

2) KXIP beats CSK [for KXIP to get to 14]

3) KKR vs RR (?) [It's simple. Win the match to stay alive. The winner too will then be involved in a tight NRR clash with others stuck at 14 points for the remaining two slots. Even then it's an uphill battle for the winner, because both KKR and RR have relatively poor runrates]

4) DC vs RCB (?) [One team can directly climb to #2 if they fetch 16. The winner will bypass the NRR drama entirely, and the loser will be thrown into the mix with the rest stuck at 14]

5) SRH beats MI [SRH climbs to 14, clashing with KXIP, RR/KKR, and DC/RCB, keeping the tournament wide open until the very final hour. Note: SRH have a superior runrate, they're likely to edge out all others on current NRR] 

Potential Final Points Table: 

MI 18

RCB 16/14

DC 16/14

KXIP 14

SRH 14

RR 14/12

KKR 14/12

CSK 10

And that's a wrap.",2

This is 2013 all over again for RCB.,3
Both the captains have completely opposite opinions on the pitch behaviour today. Interesting,8
Has Koach evolved from '20 runs short' to 'pitch changed'?,7
This match is the pre-final.,2
Is abishek sharma playing,4
Remembering RCB vs DC Hyderabad 2012. Tied on points with CSK. NRR fucks us over. CSK make the final winning eliminator and Qualifier 1. Glad we're a bit safe now but still need that second position,6

Someone should tell Rashid to tone down that wicket celebration. We all know what is the intent behind it and that is toeing the line of telling the batsman to go back to the pavilion.,1

"I see players using towels, dew setting in already?",5
I don't know why but the lack of Indian players in the SRH team makes me think they are not a strong team. Only if they had fir Bhuvi.,6
The day I support RCB they play like KKR. ffs,8
we are replicating dc every time. score will be 100 all out or something,7
Saw that Bumrah-Sandeep comparison post. Won't mind Sandeep taking 3-17 to keep up with his counterpart.,6
Is Sandeep selected for Oz tour ?,4
So this is what not loosing a wicket in the first over feels like,45
Sigh this is not good already...,-1
YJB,3
Sandeep Sharma is so fucking underrated,66
What will happens once the dew sets in??,2
What are other teams rooting for from this match?,5
Warner always has amazing field placement. He really does his homework,10
"gurkeerat can anchor, what do you guys think?",4
"If RCB crash out of this year's IPL, then Virat needs to step the fuck down from his role as a captain.",6
Binga always says Jason holder 6 foot 7,6
Par score anyo?,3
whats holders speed??,2
Holder bowling like Holder OG,2
Somebody give Jonny a pair of binoculars so that he can recreate that meme we got from him sitting in the dressing room during the SA tour,3
"Playing as anchor in T20 opening is the worst plan. Even more, if you're setting target, or chasing high score.",3
Need 200+,2
"Only if Australia would share their smith cloning machine with the world

*Sigh*",21
With the bounce that holder gets a misshit can  go for 4. Surprised they went with him over nabi,2
Josh loves leg side,3
Come on sumdge jr! You can do it,3
Honestly we should never release Rashid from SRH until he's 50.,27
Phillipe's trigger movement is same as Smith's,8
RCB fans trying hard to reverse jinxing this. FFS we couldn't even chase 120 the other day despite blistering start. This match is already yours,47
Josh even looks like Smith lmao,5
Tuk tuk already,1
What kind of shitty pitch is this,3
wicket incoming,4
Gaikwad is a more stable and compact player than Paddikal.,-8
Please RCB don't fuck it up,10
pitch is already slowing btw.,3
God fuck you haze. Wait outside the ground to catch some balls,5
Is the entire next generation of Australian batsmen just gonna copy Smith's technique. Cause I'm up for that,54
I‚Äôm glad the pitch has slowed down and everyone will stop doubting Sachin‚Äôs desert storm innings,5
Has anyone been to Chinnaswamy stadium ?,4
RCB batting in powerplay as if they're DC.,8
Nabi must have been most under utilized player in this year's IPL among all teams.,7
RCB really have to do atleast 40-45 in the powerplay otherwise Rashid will choke them hard in the middle overs,13
Wicket incoming,1
Game over,1
Would be fun if RCB lose this and then do-or-die against DC. Kohli could be staring at Pant lol,1
Is this Sharjah or Kotla,3
Love to watch Double Penetration bat.,2
"Oh man, this isn‚Äôt looking good. Also rcb bowlers better learn from SRH already on how to bowl. Don‚Äôt bowl like you did against csk",7
"Paddikal doing good in rcb?

Kid is destined for greatness",8
[deleted],1
I feel mark Nicholas over praises everybody just like Harsha,2
Broooo what's happening,1
A thought - an Indian captain cannot let someone else be the captain in IPL.,4
Imo anchors in T20 shouldn't open and instead be flexible within the middle order according to the situation. I mean why the fuck wouldn't you take advantage of the powerplay.,2
Sandeep Sharma is just 27. Will he ever play in LOIs? Or the line-up is already packed?,3
Imagine holder smacking the ball around in this tiny ground,3
Finch must be so embarrassed to be dropped for an uncapped Australian kid as Aus captain.,11
Aaron finch 2.0,1
"2 games which we should have won-

KKR superover

KXIP 127 chase

No excuses for this team. There were other games which should have been ours as well but we through it away!",6
wicket alert alert.üö®üö®üö®üö®,4
180 against SRH is a defendable score?,1
That was a catch at 30 yards ay Dubai,1
So. Does Sandeep Sharma deserve a National call up?,3
Hope the real Saha shows up today,2
That w√†s a good try to stop the ball,1
SRH‚Äôs attitude on the field today looking real good,2
"I am rooting for RCB, need that super intense RCB v MI match again!!",3
Both openers have had boundaries and settled in. Carnage about to begin.,2
Why are they batting slow. Is pitch already slowing??,3
Mothefucker,1
Pitch is tailor made for SRH,10
Fuck this,2
Damn sandy,1
What has happened to this pitch lmao,1
Koach time Orange Shits,-4
THATS MY BUMRAH JR,6
Same old same old,1
Looks like 160 will be a winning score on this pitch,3
feels like a game rcb only make 120,8
Cleannnn,6
Let's go Sandeep Sharma! Padikal gone great start.,5
Bruh! Sexy,7
Lol,3
What a ball,8
Sandeep Sharma is a superstar,8
Ofc Sandeep has to match Bumrah's numbers tonight to keep up.,5
Ah yes. Kohlapse incoming,3
What a bowl!,2
"**2.5** Sandeep Sharma to Padikkal, OUT, top of middle. On pace, swinging slightly, but mostly wicket to wicket **13-1**

D Padikkal  b Sandeep Sharma 5 (8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.50",1
Yesssss!!!,3
noooo üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,1
I‚Äôm sure SRH will unleash Rashid now,3
Fucks sake RCB get your shit together need you to win,9
"ARR SEE BEE

ARR SEE BEE

ARR SEE BEE

ARR SEE BEE

ARR SEE BEE",3
Gurkeraat in ?,2
Sandeep Sharma loves taking wickets of quality batsmen.,6
Sandeep! Love the sound of timber!,6
Inb4 Koach 100,4
Koach masterclass incoming,2
Maybe Koach will make some runs today. Padikkal hasn't taken pressure off him today,7
Castled !!,2
"DD, RCB to everyone- aap ke saath ek chota sa prank hua hai",4
"Yeess baby, sandeep in powerplay is something else.",6
The closest we'll get to Smudge and Koach batting together,23
"This is a slow pitch, im expecting saini, siraj and morris to bowl 145kmh thunderbolts.",1
Sandeep ‚Äústats as good as Bumrah‚Äù Sharma with yet another perfect yorker!,8
Kohli 32(30) incoming,2
Are we the worst batting side in Sharjah? None of our innings looked convincing and against KKR we were saved by AB,2
Choking time choking time.üïú‚è±Ô∏è‚è±Ô∏è,3
"And here we go... Goodluck SRH!
Will see you guys next season",3
What an ugly shot. Horrendous,2
"Sorry, but KABOOOOOM DEATH RATTLE BABY just cant hold it in Devdat padikkal out noooooooooo",3
you miss i hit,2
Okay mission 49 for now guys,2
Time for Koach to shine.,1
Incoming tuk tuk kohli,3
Man Bhuvi would've been lethal on this pitch üòî,5
Another 150-160 score today and Kanos will class his way till the end.,3
Hope we see ruthless Kohli,3
Sandy Sharma is an underrated work-horse.,3
Nooo look at how they massacred our boy,3
Damn son! RCB have lost all their games when Paddikal didn't score double digits,3
Sandeep underrated Sharma,3
Someone go and slap this creepy tongue twister Josh app guy.,9
I would like virat to show why he's the best in the business.. long time due,5
The SA in SAndeep Sharma stands for Silent Assassin. 104 wickets in IPL from 88 matches at an economy of 7.7!,15
I'm okay as long as KKR doesn't reach the playoffs because they're the one team that doesn't deserve a spot,3
Sandeep could be next Bhuvi ? Serious talent.. sadly no one notices him,11
Is Sandeep better than D Chahar in the powerplay? Someone pull up the numbers,7
Why do we always screw up crunch games vs Hyderabad?,18
We need another wicket,3
2 more wickets and we are done,5
Effing hell F man F,3
"Not moving feet, swinging the bat away from the body. It looks very good while it comes off, but it doesn't mean it'll work forever.",2
"RCB got them into this must win situation because of some crazy team selection in previous matches, I am guessing influenced by overthinking Koach.",5
Big fan of Philippe getting to bat with Kohli,23
I remember Sandeep has a very good record against Kohli. I think he has gotten out to him 8-10 times in the IPL.,5
"Everyfuckingtime RCB lose a wicket in the powerplay, I pray to god that the next wicket doesnt fall before the 10th over, otherwise it's destined collapse",9
Yeah Virat better show why he‚Äôs the best,4
now r/cricket will make sandeep sharma look like glenn mgrath,8
Koach and Smith batting together. What a time to be alive.,11
Anyone else excited for a gritty 54(50) from Kohli?,8
Smudge and kohli playing together. Lets gooo,8
In before everyone criticises Kohli for 40(30).,4
"once rcb start losing wickets, it just continues to fall",8
[removed],3
"I read whitehat ads are taken down by court, but still showing up in TV",3
The ball seam was facing towards 1'st slip but the ball straightened a bit.,1
Lmao we are making Sharjah seem like  Dubai pitch,7
"Damn that swing, Lord Siraj's day?",6
Incoming VK master class. 34(35),4
"All teams from 3 to 6 want RCB to win , come on you got it guys.",1
Gotta show some respect to Great sandy when facing him.,1
Koach can play slow now to stabilize the ship.,1
We will score 160 and pretend it was a slow af pitch and then let them chase in 15 overs while bowling 150 kmph,11
Kohli jinxed by saying everything they hit goes into fielders hands,1
It‚Äôs always the medium pacers that‚Äôs get wickets,3
"We're gonna lose, right?

~SRH fan here.",2
Are we in for another 51 (50) by koach,2
Lol RCB pacers will be clueless bowling on this pitch,3
i dont trust srh to chase anything above 110,-1
"Quick question, has Virat Kohli won any tournament as captain?
 (Other than the U19 WC)",1
Still paddikal>>>>>>>>>sky,-4
"I hope teams realise that bowling around the wicket is dumb to DPP, he barely moves his feet and by bowling around the wicket, u r just gifting balls for him to pull or flick",2
Even tuk tuk kholi will be great tonight.,2
[deleted],16
"NGL the Padikal wicket sound sounds nice, even if you ignore him getting out.",4
25% of batting is down.,19
"RCB - 122, SRH gonna chase it down in 14.2 overs",55
" **Virat Kohli vs Sandeep Sharma**  
11 innings  
66 runs  
Six dismissals",5
When did they start calling Koach Super V ? It‚Äôs super cringey. King Kohli much better,10
Anyone has issues with hotstar not loading ?,2
Feel like Kohli actually prefers coming in shit situations like this rather than when platform is set.,4
"TBH DDP should be more respectful. 

Gully Cricket like swing of bat.",2
There is the 2 we all have been waiting for.,5
If they can make around 45 in the poerplay now it will be good,4
RCB need to play thinking about the 4 Rashid overs in the backend.,5
"Oh shit, I even forgot that this is Sharjah",4
Koach has to keep a good strike rate this match.  160 wasn't enough against MI and on this ground I don't think even 180 will give you a piece of mind.,3
"Budget SKY  is here guys : ) 




/s",4
Sanga's pitch reports are always spot on.,3
Holder is quite an average T20 bowler. They should be playing that giraffe Stanlake over him.,7
Phillipe to reduce 5 kgs after running 2's,9
"Kohli playing with a young Steve Smith (Philippe) in RCB.


Smith playing with a young Virat Kohli (Tewatia) in RR",9
Why RCB don't counter attack every other team is trying to dominate :),4
Warner must give Sandeep one more over here.,3
"If Virat doesnt hit a half century with nice SR, I'm gonna have to bully him.",4
Kohli 56 off 45 incoming with plenty of doubles,5
Can RCB please make ABD bat at 11?,3
Imagine women's game on this pitch,0
2 runs every ball = 12 runs per over. Don‚Äôt mind it ya know if it‚Äôs like that haha,8
"To those guys who will diss on Kohli's doubles, take it from a DD fan it is severely underappreciated, we would kill to have someone willing to do that",27
"Padikkal == Padikkal ; SKY == SKY

Any other comparisons are invalid",14
Can't see them scoring more than 140 here and then SRH comes in and bats like nothing wrong with the pitch.,37
Remind what was DC's score at the end of the pp in the earlier match?,2
Why doesn't kohli look playing good these days?,2
"Man I wish Delhi and RCB didn't play each other, would have been so fun watching both of them bottle out of the competition",14
Never thought I'd see Smudge and Kohli bat together,9
RCB bros... What's going on with our teams.,4
"Miss field from lord khaleel. Anna show mercy, pls field well 

So it is nattu, smh",3
7 runs wtf?,3
"My favourite RCB XI playing. Steyn, I respect the legend that you are, but you are basically Umesh junior now.",6
Sandeep has dismissed Kohli 6 times. Now is a good time to make it 7.,7
Philippe such a cutie honestly,1
"If kohli had to sacrifice his beard to win an IPL championship, would he do it?",9
And the expected Holder boundary per over.,2
"Philippe's shots looks so fucking risky, or is it because Im a RCB fan?",20
"Don't ask me why but I feel like kohli is about to enter a rough path, much like root hit a little while ago.",1
Just look for one boundary every over and singles / doubles in the rest. Simple formula really,2
fuck yea philippe,3
"Say what you will about Koach, if it's not his day he gets out. He doesn't play Thala innings",2
"These commentators talking about Josh like he hasn't already belted Broad, Anderson, Rabada and Steyn everywhere in tour matches in Aus already. Do some research ya slackers",17
Yes sexy run rate of 6.00,9
Am I the only one getting RCB vs KKR Sharjah match vibes ? Feel another big Devilliers innings incoming,8
Which team will Philippe play for next year?,2
Not sure why too many teams don't use the pinch hitter strategy like KKR does with Narine. Why can't RCB send someone like Udana at the top or first down..,3
"RCB  * exists *

Commentators: OMG they have Kohli **and** ABDV",20
These commentators are so condescending wtf,3
wouldnt be surprised to see srh come in and score as if nothing is wrong with pitch at 8-10 runs per over in their powerplay,12
Looks like a graveyard of a pitch.,5
I hate seeing kohli not being the same batsman these days,4
"Just saw this scary stat.

Kohli vs Sandeep 
11 innings 
6 dismissals
66 runs",15
Inject some Isabgol in Kohli's game so we get the fluency back. His batting feels like a lot of effort to score a single.,14
"It's a slow pitch, RCB is fucked.",8
"Between Rcb not utilizing powerplay so far, Rashid choking them afterwards and SRH‚Äôs killer energy on the field, I see RCB not making more than 140",8
There should be an Anjum Chopra-less IPL channel. Her commentary hurts my ears,6
"Warner: *brings on holder when ab is batting*

AB- so you have chosen death",5
"This is Sharjah ffs, what you guys doing?",2
Oh shit the keeper came up,2
175 par score? I don't think we'll reach 150.,3
Who is going to bowl the death overs for srh?,6
"Koach is chewing gum, channeling his inner Finch.",21
Listen to these commentators and you'd thing Philippe was the one already out? Saying he is putting pressure on Kohli when Kohli is also out there yet to do much,7
David Warner is so fit for his age,6
"All criticise RCB for playing slow in middle.
Now RCB bringing the balance by slowing slow in PP.
Way to go team",20
"I bet in the prediction thread that srh win, putting virtual skin in the game. Plastic fans would never",7
If RCB and Delhi didn't play each other. The fans would be like.. YES WE LOST BY A LESSER MARGIN,8
Collapse,8
Fuck,6
RCB playing powerplay like the middle overs...its actually depressing,12
Great,4
"Well, fuck.",6
Virat one‚Äôs and two‚Äôs kohli,8
"All these Bravo academy kinda bowlers such as Sandeep Sharma, Holder that too on a slowish wicket must be real irritating to face.",17
Bruh,6
Rip in peace,7

"Sandy and kohli, tell me a better love story üíò",9

Useless cunts,5

Sandeep has Kohli's number,6
"Fuck it, amma roll. This ain't worth my time.",3
wow can't believe Philippe made Kohli do that...,6
Sandeep Sharma is underrated,4
FUCKKK YESSS,5

I'm gonna say paddikal >>>> kohli

VK has weakness against Sandeep,5
Okay congratulations for the win srh,4
Just hope Kane isn‚Äôt injured. He is an extraordinary fielder but it is scary watching him.,9
Sandeep Sharma and kohli never ending story!!!!,2
Well time to switch off eh,2
"Koach Noooo.

We are fucked today,7
OH SHIT IS AB BATTING IN THE POWER-PLAY,6
Ah yes out of the tournament we go,3
I really hope we get to see at least 1 interesting match today....,4
Sandeep Sharma - kryptonite of Virat Kohli,11
"Kohli's 7th dismissal against Sandeep. 65+ runs, 7 wickets.",4
SMH why did I predict RCB would win this.. real dumb energy from me,4
Awesome strategy by Saha to stand-up.,7
No way in hell we win this,8
"So the Prophecy was true. 

Sandeep Potter gets Voldemort Kohli's wicket.",3
Sandy-Kohli >>> Archer-Warner,9
Kane you beauty ‚ù§Ô∏è,7
Pls don't bring out AB it's too early,4
iight imma head out.,6
Ffs. The one day I support RCB,9
Take ABd out and that's the game!,1
I think Shahbaz is going to get a bowl now. Warner was waiting for ABD to come out before he could use him.,6
Lucky for the Indian team that Sandeep Sharma is also Indian,7
Should have sent gurkeerat now. Don't expose abd so early.,6
"Warner's brought out the towel.
Looks like lots of dew already",7
Well VK smashes all the bowlers around the world and is a Sandeep Sharma bunny. TIL,2
"Sorry to ask, is kohli going on the same lane as dhoni did? Bcz he's just a different batsman this season except one innings. I know its early but still.",2
And IPL gets interesting till the last match.,4
"Well it was nice while it lasted, 5th place it is",7
So finally RCB is back in form,8
What's Samsung toll free number? I've an accidentally broken tv screen üòí,10
"One more wicket SRH needs , after that it's a looooooong tail",5
Boy. SRH is going to fuck with RCB. Aren't they?,7
F F F F F F F THE STATS CAME TRUE SANDEEP GOT HIM,10
Good easter egg with the number 7 there by the script writers /s,5
"""This bottom of the bat I tell you, always takes the ball to the fielder"" - Kohli",3
What an over from Sandeep to get rid of Paddikal though tbf,5
Kohli is Sandeep Sharma's bunny? Who would have thought!,5
Good to see Koach not abusing on getting out,4
How does he ALWAYS get Kohli's wicket. FML,6
Sandeep Sharma can be a great bowler in Test cricket.,6
"Awww hell yeah, let's dent the run rate bois",1
Is Philippe the love child of Steven smith and Marnus?,2
"K O H L A P S E

What are RCB doing? We just handed them 2nd place on a silver platter....,7
Why the fuck does this happen every year? Can we not make it comfortably once?,7
Sandeep's bunny,8
Kohllapse‚Ñ¢,4
Sandeep underrated Sharma,3
One more wicket and the game is in SRH's bag,1
What secret of Kohli does Sandeep know? I wonder.,1
Don't send ab. Send gurkeerat.,2
Bhai aaj kal Kohli ko kya ho gaya dhobhi ke raste pe jaa rha hai,0
so i guess this means sandeep gets injured today,3
Chad Tiktoker vs Virgin Dinosaur,7
ehh idk if this rcb team even deserves the playoffs,3
Don't worry guys.. just wonder what'll happen if AB gets to face 50 balls,5
Sharjah is too Sandy for Koach eh?,1
Wheres that guy who was worried about the stats of sandeep vs kohli LOL nice one,2
Sandy could get Kohli out 10 times and still wouldn‚Äôt be selected for India‚Äôs T20I team. Underrated,7
Mr 360's time to shine and entertain.,1
2015: RCB chased 81 in just 5.5 overs v SRH in a rain affected game,2
"Ab, send AB you cowards!!",1
Kohli bought Zampa. He will now buy Sandy Sharma in mega auction. He doesn't like being a bunny,5
Earlier I thought the match was 60-40 in favor of RCB now it is looking 50-50 and that's great for a neutral cricket fan.,1
Jeez. One more wicket and the tail starts,4
"Now since ABD is in, so will be Rashid Khan",3
Say good fucking bye to top 2. Say hello to hoping other results go our way to qualify.,5
Kane mamaaa,3
"Come on RCB score 180 without Kohli, ABD and shock the world",3
"Kohli: *exists

Warner pointing to Sandeep: Give this man the ball",9
COLLAPSE.,1
"MI pls beat SRH in your last game please üôè - Sincerely, Winner of KKR/RR & KXIP.",4
AB show us yo magic once again.,1
Ah Devilliers with that MRF bat. Love,1
SRH PLEASE F OFF YOU GUYS ALREADY TOOK OUR 2016 IPL WHY YOU GUYS SUCH A BUG IN OUR ASS. F OFF PLEASE,9
Can we get AB out too.,1
Doesnt De Villers have a pretty poor record against Rashid Khan as well?,2
RCB done with Rashid around i dont think it will be easy with ABD in early,1
"Kohli in meaningless friendly matches: Legend.

Kohli in important matches, especially in tournament knockouts: Garbage.",7
Why is Sandeep not in any squad for the Australia series?,2
Bring in Rashid!!,1
Sandeep being nearly identical to Bumrah on paper again,1
"No matter what score RCB end up from here, we can never rule out SRH bottling their chase.",6
Back in February when Virat shat bed in NZ he said he was over worked and needed rest certainly 6 months of rest hasn't done much to him. üòû,5
"Well rcb is fucked, they are 2 down and haven't faced rashid yet",2
Kohli really hasn't had a good ipl this year huh.,2
"AB comes, send in Rashid",2
So RCB vs DC is a knockout?,4
I'm getting a feeling that rcb is gonna lose today idk why but now ik,8
So Kohli doesn‚Äôt champion taking bowlers in the team who repeatedly get him out?,6
"De Villiers inside power play. 

Good luck to us.",7
"*Kohli Struggling*

*Upcoming series in Australia*

India fans: *chuckles* I am in danger",41
You can smile now Sandeep.,2
Tfw when your tail starts at 3 down,3
"For the love of imaginary god, I hope Kohli comes to form in international matches atleast. He's been kinda dull since 10+ months now.",11
"Anushka ""Panoti"" Sharma",-22
RCB vs DC potential knockout lessgoooo.,8

YRKFA coming in the next over.,3
Srh fans getting happy . Imagine abd playing 60 balls on this ground.,3
"Looks like neither of the teams I support will make it into playoffs.

Feelsbadman.jpg",6
Rashid still to bowl guys :),1
Can't hide ABD now has to play 4 overs of Rashid,6
From the look of it anything above 120 SRH would suffer,1
What is this shit RCB?,8
What is RCB doing? Rashid hadn't even come out to bowl yet!,3
"Now, with Kohli gone, as a Kings XI fan I may as well wish RCB gets bowled out early and destroy their NRR.",6
"Why is he tapping the ground, is he feeling for the pitch surface or for evenness?",2
this commentator just blamed Philippe for Paddikal's dismissal? It was the 3rd over ffs there was no pressure,11
Has Phillipe played any international matches?,3
"Get ab out, and match is done",4
"Should‚Äôve send gurkeerat before abd, this would be his natural position also",1
[deleted],2
Wait I thought AB was supposed to come in after Sundar and Udana,3
Cheeku was a cartoon bunny. Virat is called Cheeku. He is Sandeep's bunny.,0

that a superhero low-angle shot of De Villiers taking guard with two floodlights in the background is apt! make this a thing for every ABD innings!,3
It's going to come down to RCB vs DC!,2
Why does that guy have to promote his app while taking a shower?,2
"As they mentioned in this Sub, Sandeep Sharma is indeed discount Bumrah.",9
Sandeep really is a true war horse,2
"Kanos mama dancing is going into my ""homework"" folder",1
Alright I'll go cry in a corner,6
RCB choking,0
Rcb feeling bad for dd,1
Should have just sent in Gurkeerat,0
Chances of Rashid getting AB and this innings going down the shitter after that?,7
"If we ever let go Sandeep Sharma, Kohli will make sure he is in RCB, no matter what cost...",5
Have they morphed the face of Kane in that Jio advert?,1
"This is the RCB the world knows and loves

"Either kohli plays a slow innings accumulating runs too slowly or he just gets out. Before you attack, yes I do remember the innings against chennai. An outlier.",0
The non-cricketer actors in Dream11 Ads are really good. 1000x better than Tiger Shroff.,2
"Koach would have thrown few benchods, Mc's at batsman if his side got two early wickets.",6
Good thing is there's no Sandeep Sharma type bowler in Australia üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,3
Smudge and abd batting together. Lets gooo,3
Other batsamen for RCB Gurkeerat Sundar Morris would drag out the score to 140ish and SRH chases that down in 17.,2
I guess lord is going to enjoy bowling today,4
Is Pitch slow or is our batting tripe,2
This doesn't look good... Kohli looks like he's gonna be a walking wicket against Australia!!! He just can't seem to score!!,0

IN ABD WE TRUST - üôè",7
Breaking news: Australia wants to give citizenship to Sandeep Sharma,5
SRH always playing spoilsport for RCB,6
Sachin:Cronje::Kohli:Sandeep,6
The biggest problem with Kohli is that he always takes some time to get set..... early on he always takes singles and doubles till he gets into the flow and starts striking.It backfires if he gets out early though,4
Yeah AB gonna fuck us,2
Waiting for chahal to score his first century,20
As long as AB is batting I will not lose hope,4

"RCB and Delhi Collapse

Bandwagon fans : wtf?

Og RCB and Delhi fans : First time?",56
When we are amazed at the teams that win all their remaining matches to qualify we should not ignore the part played by teams like delhi and bangalore who also lose all their remaining matches to get knocked out.,1
"If ABD doesnt start hitting after 10 balls, i'm gonna fucking cry",3
"The wicket does look slow , DDP would have scored at a better SR otherwise",3
"Rcb has a very good bowling lineup for this pitch, udana will do well I reckon",2
First 6 overs without main Strike bowler Check                               2 Wickets down in PP while below 6 RR Check,3
ABD is just in. Should have given this over to Rashid,0
Abhishek Sharma hasn't even bowled yet. Rip RCB.,-1
"Expecting RCB to now playing with a SR of 80 for the next 8 overs, choking, and reaching 125 at the end.",8
is the wicket actually this slow or is rcb fooling us again ?,2
Bowling boys,1
Just heard that the Great Sean Connery have passed away. Truly a marvel of modern cinema. RIP :(,11
RCB and DC back to their original forms,1
Nattu really needs to work on his grooming department.,1
wtf is happening,1
"Everyone was making fun of SRH for not having a genuine fast bowler, but with the pitches slowing down, these conditions are ideal for SRH‚Äôs slow pace attack",6
Lol Ashish Nehra should just shut the fuck up.,1
And Koach wanted to bat first. Big Brain Move.,2
Nataranjan wont ever get selected for the Indian team until he cuts that thing off,15
"Quality Top Order Batsman : *exists*

Sandeep Sharma: Its free real estate.",14
These commentators are seconds away from blaming the holocaust on Philippe. He has done nothing wrong at all wtf. This is ridiculous,3
Kane Williamson's dancing in the jio dhan dhana dhan ad gives credence to the belief that white men can't dance.,-2
Hope we are not playing on this shit pitch in the play offs.,3
I feel guys like Kohli need a crowd to perform better,3
"Virat got confused playing with Phillipe, thinking it was his nemesis Smith and gave his wicket away",4
"Commentators when RCB‚Äôs batting ‚ÄúThis is a low-slow wicket‚Äù

Commentators when RCB‚Äôs bowling ‚Äúerr! It‚Äôs not really a bad wicket eh‚Äù",15
"Two left arm spinners and Rashid yet to bowl with right handers batting, yeah RCB is fucked.",5
AB de Villiers and his proteg√© batting together,6
Now that Kohli has shat the bed 3 times in a row will he possibly blame himself? Nah clearly the RCB bowling has already lost the game.,1
"Ashish Nehra at 7:20 P.M : "" This pitch is not for RCB team""",6
Let's goo orange armyyyyyüî•üî•üî•üî•,4
"We already got to see vintage Delhi, vintage RCB now??",11
And more evidence that this Sub messed up Kohli's mindset. He looked to score boundaries before he faced 20 balls. That is a cardinal sin,2
[removed],22
Dc wanted to bat too today. Kohli==iyer.,6
"Looks like RCB took raw pace at the auction (Umesh, Saini, Steyn, Morris, Siraj) and only one bowler capable of off-cutters and knuckle balls (Udana)",18
"Sanga blaming Philippe for Padikkal's dismissal when Padikkal was 5 off 7 balls at one stage, with 4 of those runs coming via a boundary. What the fuck, honestly? How did Philippe 's inability to rotate strike put pressure on Paddikal to go for the big hit? Disgusting commentary.",25
Is this pitch actually slow or is it just poor batting?,6
smith looking bit shaky compared to last night,13
Only hope left is holder,10
"I know ABD kept wickets in the previous game too. But can someone tell me, why Philippe wasn‚Äôt keeping?",7
Finch > philipe,1
"Tbf that was dogshit from Koach. Packed offside field and he tries to muscle a shot through the covers. All he had to do was go over the top, but he's really stubborn about playing checked shots in the early part of his innings.",6
What an over,5
Daaaamn only one run out of Natarajan,8
Superb powerplay for SRH.,6
Good score on this pitch ? 84?,6
Looks like RCB un-peaked at the wrong time.,12
"Rashid and Siraj are yet to bowl.

60 runs at stake rn",10
"Welp, SRH are winning this",6
"Good Yorker ,great stop nattu. Well done",4
"Reminder that if RCB lose this, RCB vs DC will decide who plays the qualifier.",8
omg those yorkers tho,5
"Why are commentators blaming Philippe for padikkals wicket, it's not like padikkal was scoring at a SR of 150 and then succumbed to pressure.",16
So that was a horrendous powerplay. Thanks,5
Friendly reminder : This SRH doesn't have Bhuvi.,18
Bowl out Holder here?,2
I'm curious how they use different crowd noises for different outcomes of shots. Is it AI? Or manual? Lol,2
Now imagine this bowling attack but Nabi instead or holder and bhuvi instead of Shahbazz,2
Future Fatherhood has already made Kohli soft. Good for family bad for India.,-1
That reels as with the tractor is so cool,6
SRH gonna bowl Rashid Khan now,3
Rashid khan go for it.,1
"1 run off natrajan over.

Looks like everyone is Rashid today on the SRH team.",5
"Rcb has 3 bowlers who will bowl over 140+ on slow pitch.

Bye bye rcb",6
Philippe will make it big. Rcb needs to trust him.,3
"Everyone in rcb is out of form. Can't expect anything if even kohli and abd don't score and mediocrity from players like Paddikal is celebrated like crazy just because it's not outright terrible play. Just have to ask for bowlers to save them again, which won't happen on this pitch",-2
Why does Philippe get so many chances while Jaiswal gets kicked out for batting the same way?,-2
"almost repeat of last match, 2 wickets in pp with low scoring rate, and the best bowler hasn't bowled yet",3
Thala is a state of mind. Anyone can be a Thala on any given day.,9
"Blaming Phillipe is so easy, try doing Dhoni when he does the exact same maybe, yea commentators?",9
[deleted],5
[deleted],64
"This slow start at Sharjah, it seems like everything is set for Koach to say his usual ""We were 10-15 runs short"" post match",17
Philippe doesn't belong here,1
abd will demolish the spinners,-1
Bring in Rashid and go for the kill.,3
"I know we will lose today, but I just dont want the nrr to dip down further.",7
yeah save Rashid overs for the death /s,1
Which teams are out of contention with an SRH victory here?,1
"Here‚Äôs a cool fact about Koach‚Äôs dismissal a few minutes ago


It was the same ball from Sandy, same shot from Virat and caught at the same fielding position (only it was caught by Kanos this time instead of Warner)
which dismissed Kohli at Hyderabad last year",53
I remember AB destroying Holder in an ODI in 2015,8
Is Labuschagne a good T20 player?,3
RCB better post 140 plus. Else this day would have been a fucking waste.,7
"SRH bowlers take off their masks.

They're clones of Rashid.",7
"""Josh Philippe started Covid"" - Sanga",25
My my- what have we got here!?,3
Anyone who calls Labuschagne as Sabudana in their heads ?,7
Rashid literally licking his lips,8
spinners will be taken to cleaners with the dew on. ABD wicket is crucial,10
"This is exactly like the last game, except we dont have a strong start",2
Josh needs to do the #tonguetwisterchallenge on Josh.,5
"This may be unpopular, but I'm really enjoying Sangakkara's commentating. He has a lot of information and talks about things normal commentators don't. Also his voice is so deep and calm",12
"The worst thing for Kings XI, Rajestan and KKR is RCB loses their next two games closely, and passes us on NRR. 

Which makes top 4 - 1) Mumbai, 2) Deli 3) Sunrisers 4) RCB",4
Why are there two abd‚Äôs battingüòÆ,5
"Rahul, Dhawan, Warner, Kohli and Padikkal are in the top 5 for most runs. Still feels like only Rahul has been consistent. Rest have had some disappointing innings",7
Can we pls not lose the momentum now,9
Dropped the cup there mate,19
Thanks nadeem ffs,17
Smudge bout to explode,7
Fuck,4
Fuck...,6
No no no,3
Dropped the cup there mate.,8
"By looking the way Philippe is batting, I was expecting his strike rate to be over 300 and then realized it was less than 100.",7
"dropped abd?

ha he'll score 99 now",7
Thank god,1
So commentators went from shitting on Phillipe not rotating strike to orgasming over his looks...,3
"In 2014 Virat had poor Eng tour and smashed 4 centuries in Aus after that.
 



In 2018 Virat had great Eng tour only smashed 1 Century in Aus.





In 2020 Virat is having not so good IPL by his standard so how many 100 you expect in Aus from Pujara?",26
SRH tamullu please stop with the reverse jinxing,10
What happened?,1
"*""Thanks for the Thooth Fielding"".*  
\- RCB",1
I think everybody will focus on and and smith lite would go under the radar and score a masterclass.,2
Rashid is def gonna get a wicket this over,6
"Nadeem is actually very underrated, sadly we‚Äôve only been giving him max. 2 overs every game",5
"All is want is teams at position 3,4,5,6 to have same points at the end of league phase.
It will be fun :D",3
YOU DO NOT EVER DROP ABD,8
Can RCB defend a low-ish total?,2
If Phillipe goes big here Captain Finch should add him for India white ball squad,6
Match right there :(,2
Bad toss to lose for RCB?,4
Ball is stopping like hell,2
"I refuse to believe this is a slow wicket, until Warner fails to wreak havoc on the RCB bowlers.",2
Dropped the game,3
Fuck you don't drop ABD. :'(,4
[removed],3
Dropped,1
AB is looking shaky as fuck man,4
Okay now im genuinely scared,2
That was surely Philippe's fault for making AB play that shot?,3
ABD gonna spank us. He already got a life.,1
Atleast have a slip for ABD vs Rashid,4
Don't worry guys that catch doesn't prove costly.,1
AB looking pretty shaky,3
I'm predicting 130 here,1
It would be mad scenes if DC & KXIP lose their playoff spot to SRH & KKR,2
Who is this Rashid? This young teen looks promising!,6
I‚Äôm Telugu but support RCB; this match is a lose-lose,2
This is painful,3
That' drop is very very expensive,3
Pressure on ABD. way to go boys!,2
Today we'll get to see if ABD is really poor against leg spinners,3
Expect a googly next ball.,3
Love to watch Rashid bowl well but not today please,2
Bad vibes about RCB today. Collapse incoming I think.,3
There was a stumping there.,2
Rash is making AbD dance,5
Ab is still 4(10) and Rashid has 3 more overs calm tf down,4
ABD can‚Äôt play leg spinners?,3
Waiting for that smartstat from ESPNcricinfo saying dropping AB saved SRH 50 runs.,8
Boy. I bet the hearts of many RCBians might have stopped the moment AB drove back to Shabaz.,6
Get to atleast 49 ffs,7
[removed],5
Target the stumps now,2
"DAMN, de Villiers isn't able to hit Rashid at all",3
AB 4 off 11? Why are these commentators not telling AB he is Stalin?,8
ABD beaten twice,4
Put a slip for fuck sake,8
Rashid is matched with a keeper that can handle him behind the stump,12
What a contest this,6
"Why is ABD going after Rashid? You already lost kohli, just see him off.",7
That's some quality bowling from Rashid,3
That is some seriously good bowling from Rashid,9
Bruh Rashid literally bullying ABD,26
This is as good as a battle I've ever seen,10
Sympathy run given by Rashid,6
Either abd gets out playing the cut or its a huge drive and bowled thru the gates,7
We wait for another year bois. Just RCB things,25
Wide s the only way we getting runs,5
Super human from rashid,6
"I was eating dorito chip when phone ring
""AB is kil""
no",6
Where are the strike rate nerds.,12
Rashid is the kryptonite,9
AB please just survive rashid. Lift the others over the stadium. Just survive Rashid,7
Rashid looks unplayable,8
4 dots,7
I wanna see Ishan Kisha v Rashid one day!,9
"Ffs, discounting rashid's quota, we have 9 overs left to find runs in :'(",9
"6(13) ,is ummm did uh Ab join Thala academy ?",6
DEW‚Ñ¢ is gonna fuck us in the second innings.,5
"Roses are red

Violets are blue

Against young Rashid

ABD has no clue",44
It‚Äôs fun watching other teams shit the bed to be honest lol.,9
Nadeem just dropped SRH chances to top 4,6
Expensive over from Rashid. Gave away 4.,21
"Did Anjum Chopra say Nadeem's pants are too tight, too stiff..


*What just happened here?*",6
"If there's no dew, Chahal & Sundar are gonna wreak havoc on this pitch. SRH needs to restrict RCB under 140.",4
It's gonna be so fun on Monday if RCB manage to lose this one... It'll be a game of who can fuck up shit more.,6
Perfect time for RCB to use the depth in their batting!,4
Fuck RCB gonna shit the bed. We are countering inform Warner and Shah.,7
The teams that understood you need to attack in the powerplay are doing well. Warner and Saha will blitz the powerplay when they bat.,8
Abd looking dangerous,3
If Philippe gets out I expect to hear that it's AB's fault,7
"Why're Rcb fans worried that Abd is playing slow, if he sees off Rashid he can single handedly get rcb to a winning score",12
"AB you can do it. This is sharjah. Just lift the other bowler‚Äô balls into the air, you‚Äôll get them over",3
ABD is looking like confused cat chasing a laser pointer in Rashid's bowling. No offense though,6
This is as bad as Delhi's batting performance so far.,1
I know it's too risky to take chances but is that Kohli in disguise of ABD?,6
[removed],-6
[deleted],13
The tiger is angry now. Just smash like hulk ABD,2
Sheeeeeet Dev looking more like Mr 36 to tonight.,3
I don't like Amitabh Bachchan. That is all.,39
Tfw Sanga shits on the guy scoring half of our runs üôÉ,14
They need to go after Nadeem. Rashid has 3 overs left,6
Phew... Passed 49... Moral victory,7
oh stop flexing sunny.,3
some INTENT‚Ñ¢ from phillipe,2
49 crossed. Moral victory,7
What do you guys think will be a decent total here?,3
"Give ball to Kane, he bowled well than this. Smh",4
We should surely play Lamichhane next game right? Leggies look a bit troubling to rcb,2
Think the likes of RCB and DC have become complacent enough to lose matches in a streak.,2

Maybe they should try to go aerial,2
"Philippe showing great character, that isn't an easy pitch to bat on",5
I‚Äôm calling 140-160 for RCB here,5
Looks like they have picked Nadeem to smash!,7
"SRH RCB should be a real rivalry now, even these guys are getting on our nerves now.",5
Can someone explain how dew affects the play?,2
I swear The dugout commentators are giggling every time they say ‚ÄúSanjay Bangerrrr‚Äù,5
RCB batsmen's kryptonite is bowlers running fast and bowling a slow delivery. It just bamboozles their mind.,45
"In western genre movies there would be a scene where a bully cowboy would make some poor guy jump and dance by shooting near his feet. Rash's bowling and AbD dancing to that, reminded me of that scene.",9
I think 180 is par score if due is a factor . Rcb will have a fighting chance if they score above 160.,8
Phillips looks and plays like a budget Steve Smith.,39
Phillipe already doing better than his skipper Finch. Anything more is a bonus.,37
[deleted],2
"ABD, Gayle, Pollard the more the balls they eat and spend time on crease, the more destructive they will become later on.",28
Delhi were 49 for 2 after 10 overs. RCB are 52 for 2 after 9 overs.,4
"Just tuned in, and WTF has AB also joined the tuk-tuk bandwagon?",1
"Guys do u think if there was a pole in the dugout studio, swanney wud pole dance?",10
Phillipe all set for a magical knock,4
Philippe playing a gem of an innings here. Taking some pressure off AB.,5
Philipe is a good future prospect for rcb.,6
[deleted],2
"Ah shit 3 more overs of Rashid, AB needs to survive",3
"I'm not sure what curator has done to this pitch and it is good or bad, but whatever it is . It has started creating snooze fest in last few games.",6
"SRH have 4 bowlers who turn the ball away in their lineup today. 

So happy RCB went with common sense and not matchups, otherwise we wouldn't have seen AB today",9
For a moment after koach's dismissal I was worried about 49!,8
I can't believe they dropped ABD. This was SRH's chance.,10
That AB catch should have been taken. It‚Äôs definitely going to be costly for us.,6
Ok Most likely Rashid going to bowl on ABD now. Damn this'll be crazy.,6
Mumbai is gonna win it this year without any pressure.. csk was the only worthy opponent until last year and now they are gone too.. look at dc and rcb crumble.. smh,9
Phillipe is so good,4
Phillipe was dropped from Australia LOI's squad for replacing Finch.,9
Please remind me of a situation just like this for AB where he took the team to a very good total,7
"We can still qualify. It depends on SRH repeating the collapse they had in the reverse game and against KXIP today, or on DC being more shit than we are in the last game.",10
"Pitch looks unplayable rn, wait till warner comes and smashes every bowler",40
Srh reverse jinxing and Rcb jinxing today at r/cricket,8
"Win toss, win game",5
I really hope that drop of AB costs SRH. AB needs to show why you shouldn‚Äôt give him chances.,19
What is with hyderabad and screwing rcb playoff chances... Why do they hate rcb so much,28
[deleted],7
"I HAVE SEEN GOD, HE BATS AT NUMBER 4 IN RCB. IN ABD WE TRUST. PLEASE SAVE US ABD",17
Philippe on his way doing SKY to Aussie selectors.,13
"I imagine David Warner in a darkened room with a pen and notebook, watching opposing teams bat. ""F*cking got him."" 

And sets up the perfect field placement to crumble them.",10
"After every Virat failure I check on Social media of other players who can win us matches in Aus. 


Update: Ishant is staring at ball and hoping to bowl soon. Vihari is staring at Cricket bats and hoping quarantine to over soon. And Pujara is just staring at passport size photos of Starc, Cummins and Hazelwood without blinking. I am not lying go check it out on Insta.",10
"If this was VK this sub would've crucified him, but since it's AB he gets a free pass",4
Our fielding is bang average excluding few good fileders,2
Fuck man that Nadeem drop is gonna screw us over. I sense it,8
"*A bowler runs fast and bowls slow.*

RCB batsman: Wait... thats illegal",38
Lol at everyone aghast at ABD struggling. He's demonstrated so far this tournament how he doesn't look to hit the spinners too heavy and double down by going mental against pace.,5
"Hate how much you want but reality is:
1. Kohli has said he cannot do multiple things at one time, tons of examples, 
2. When other team players are practicing, he is swimming with his pregnant wife for 3 hours followed by a BBQ night.
3. During strategic timeout - other captains are focused on strategies and discussions with players - Kohli is asking Anushka if she had enough food.

So lets not brush aside everything under the carpet of feminism, reality is its case by case - its not Anushkas fault but its Kohlis, he cannot focus on game due to his family, so family should also understand.",-42
"RCB- Whenever wins make sure fans cry of happiness

Also

RCB-Whenever loses make sure fans will cry more :)",20
Can't blame Nadeem for that drop. It was hit hard,13
Nothing is more dangerous than a settled batsmen on these kind of pitched. SRH needs to keep taking wickets to keep up the pressure.,7
It will be the most RCB thing to have Saini's 145 km/hr smashed in the powerplay.,46
Why don't captains go out to talk to their batsman during strategic timeouts?,2
"Aakash bhai ne bola hai ""oos ka afsoos hoga"" to hoga",4

Lexington,8
Dew is really coming down,2
VVS needs to come with a trigger warning for the Aussies watching. All I see when I see him is him and Dravid dead batting,17
RCB to over complicate the innings like Delhi where they try to setup a stable base all innings only to throw everything away in a over.,1
What's the PPT joke?,2
Come on rash get a wicket.,0
Smith lite is doing good .,3
People said Sharjah was a bowler's graveyard. How do you explain this.,3
What's Rashid's official age?,5
No mincing words. VVS is fat.,7
"If we get at least 20 off Rashid, that's a win",11
"Obviously, I'm not in on the joke. What's with VVS and PPT?",7
Fuck I sense an invincible AB now,7
The fuck did u bowl short?!?!,3

Couple decent overs!,1
AB is moving more freely in the crease.,5
Saha's face looks like he's been stung by a bee.,2
Defnitely impressed with  Philippe. He got variety of shots,5
What's with Laxman and PPT memes?,4
Getting a panic attack each time Rashid comes on to bowl,6
"ABD is getting into the groove, the getting closer to 360 boss mode...",9
Everyone has been calling Delhi the second best team of the tournament when RCB are right there.,7
Philippe living dangerously. But but it‚Äôs the only way he lives.,5
The only reason I watch IPL matches is so that I can listen to Sharman Joshi shout in my ears.,6
Nadeem took a wicket this year right???,5
Would 160 be a good score ?,4
It's fine replicating the crowd noise but do they have to include those annoying vuvuzelas? It's an assault on the senses,4
My prediction : RCH 160,3
SLAUGHTER TIME BABY,3
Nadeem is the bowling version of Jadhav,4
"If not RCB, I can definitely rely on MI to beat SRH right? Right?!!",2
Haha Ab go brrr,1
Who are the hittable bowlers in SERH?,1
Almost forgot what a 6 was,2
"meh, this isnt the worst of starts, If AB stays till the end we can get an above par score.",5
Fuck off Nadeem,2
Philippe trigger movement is negating Rashid's googly. It is also affecting his rhythm in a way.,3
"Nadeem is useless here, isn't he?",3
AB time,3
I believe that dropped catch is going to cost us badly,4
So it begins.,4
We dont deserve ABD :(,6
Right RCB getting 200 now,1

Our bowling is good this year but what I saw in last SRH match we are pretty much screwd :(,3

hahahahahahahahahahahahha,3
Fuck fuck fuck,7

"WTF , ABD, that was not necessary",6
I don't understand why he had to play like this!! Just stay there for the team man!!,4
"Man, I thought that was 6",14
I feel my heart crack :),11
Fuck! That never looked like it was going to be out!!,8
Legggoooo,4
That looks a straight forward catch but wow he hit that so hard,6
Fuck off RCB,6
*insert Mario game over music here*,5
Ok done for the day I guess,7
Why the fuck was he trying to hit every ball ?,3
Alright boys see you tomorrow,3

all that mutual funds ads helped nadeem to calculate the risks here.,5

Perfect day to watch some good ol TPL(Test Premier League),1
"Lawda lasan logic by Abd.

Already hit enough runs this over. Why risk again in 11th fucking over???",7
Sad,5
You can trust the South Africans to be useless in crunch matches.,8
Mark Nicholas unleashed the commentators curse,2
Udana can bat.,2
Bangar can't be sure ABD was playing on front foot or back foot and he was Indian team's batting coach üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,2
"ABD tuk tuk /s

Seriously this sub would have ripped Kohli apart if he played like that",4
Unpopular opinion: I've said this before too but AB shouldn't come in before the 10th over,3
Nattu only bowled 1 over?,3
"AB is just a discount Philippe

Don't @ me",5
"Come on RCB..KXIP,RR,KKR trusted you",2
"Unless a miracle happens today, RCB is gonna lose.",2
All of r/cricket now coaching AB on how he should have placed his innings. Good stuff,6
Get him Rash!,2
"That over was already 10 runs, why did he need to go for more :( :(",5
And Warner is going to bully RCBians.,3
Alright DC game it is then. Delhi please be shittier than this shit show.,2
That was not in the script lmao,2
only actual big hitter left now aside from philippe is morris but he's not consistent at all,2
"Guys it's Halloween and Sunrisers are wearing spooky season colors, we should've known",5
Yeah this was gonna happen. Even AB was struggling against Rashid and he had to look to hit extra against others. That one 6 was not enough looking at the score and with 2 Rashid overs left.,1
"Guys, anyone know to get yourself out of a Stockholm syndrome type relationship?",4
....why not send Gurkeerat?,2
Looking like 3 losses in a row. At this point we don‚Äôt deserve to make the playoffs tbh,4
Irresponsible. With 9 overs to go,1
"Yo Philippe, calm your tits, please see out this over",6
"We‚Äôre gonna have to regret that csk loss don‚Äôt we ? Effing csk in the one season they don‚Äôt do anything, poop our party.",4
So.. RCB tail exposed?,6
ABD has infused South African choking into RCB. It‚Äôs inevitable,5
"Yes, Philippe, attack rash. That‚Äôs how he takes wickets. Go after him.",4
i dont think its fair that one of rcb - dc is getting second place,3
"ABD was just about to change the gears, Nadeem got him already. What a time to get a wicket for SRH.",2
RCB look like the most and least balanced side at the same time.,7
Bonus 4 from rashids over,1
5 wides! Oh no,2
Pant would had stopped that,1
Why is gurkeerat in the team lol? Rotating strike is what they need now.,3
Looks like we will get to see another one sided game today,2
Philippe and Myself have similar batting style. We look explosive but won't touch the ball.,4
[deleted],1
Fucking hell,1
Washie is Sunil Narine tier batsmen no?,2
They might not even get 130 now.,3
"Game over. After Kohli and ABD, the rest of the batsmen on this team are garbage.

RCB desperately hoping Chris Morris shows up and saves them lmao.",2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xJ4q-V2Glc,1
Noo Rashid is getting hit,1
Philippe not reading rashid well,2
"5 runs off Rashid ,now they can play him out

Edit : Phillippe got 0 sense lol",2
"Someone: Name someone more bipolar than Kanye

r/cricket: hold my beer",6
Josh not giving any fucks,6
I've never seen any spinner enjoy beating the batsman as much as Rashid,4
Rashid legit gets mad if he gets hit. Was all smiley-happy in the first over. Economy goes a touch above 6 and now he's looking at Joshua like he insulted his mum after every ball,39
Dew will play huge role tonight,6
Collapse,6
he's not picking your legbreak so why bowl a googly lmao,7
Fucking idiot,3
Pain,4
Why???,5
"Typical RCB, fucking losers.",6
Phillippe is working in progress atm.,5
And Rashid had gotten the Wicket.,5
This is getting worse,3
Rashid already given away 18 runs!,4
That was like a lion playing with its prey.,3
Pure blisssssssssss‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®,8
"Out of all the bowlers in the SRH lineup, you decide to attack Rashid",27
What the F is he slogging Rashid for,9
Is this replay of last match... Fucking shit,6
Let‚Äôs go Rashid!,5
Why. The. Fuck.,6
Rashid is unreal . A total freak,5
"Look now as Phillipe is shat on, while Kohli and ABD go unscathed",2
Philippes getting beaten was satisfying to watch,2
Seems like there's a lot of dew. Ball is slipping. Hopefully makes batting easier in the second innings,6
Oh shit.,2
How stupid do you have to be to attack Rashid,5
Way too reliant on AB and Kohli this team is,2
Let‚Äôs gooo babyyy,3
[deleted],8
DC' mindless batting lives on in RCB,3
"*AB tapping his temple*

You can‚Äôt be Rashid‚Äôs bunny if you gift your wicket to some other bowler",11
why the fuck would you want to hit now,5
DC - RCB,5
RCB has done a RCB.,5
Couldn't see this dude off?,2
WTF RCB. Surrender already.,2
"Don't worry guys, we've already crossed 49",10
"Haha I knew, was going to get out.",5
"If RCB don't trust Gurkeerat as a batsman in this situation, what's the point of playing him in the XI?",6
SENA and their struggles with Spin. Somethings never change.,4
"no one, i mean no one attacks Rashid without facing the consequences",8
Typical RCB chokers.,4
Philippe is future ABD,6
"Note to self-

Never trust RCB again",5
RASHID KHAN IS MY FATHER,8

I blame this on Vijay Malia.,4
"Rashid be like : ""Yeah talk nah Phillipe bhaijaan""",10
RCB really needs Mooen Ali for the middle order. No one's scared of their middle order at all.,9
Oh fuck yes Rashid!,4
2 absolutely new batsmen on the crease now!,9
Man. Mood swings of r/cricket,11
Rashid is a freak,8
RCB looking forward to lose this,4

98/10 works too,5
almost certain rashid bowled that half tracker on purpose knowing he would go for it,6

Let's appreciate how field placement has been absolutely spot on.,5
"Thanks for restoring NORMALCY to 2020, RCB",6

Batting order over already lmao what a joke,5
Have to pray MI beat SRH on tuesday then(provided RR beat KKR and CSK beat KXIP tomorrow),4

At least he played more overs than his age,4

"""We were 20 runs short"" coming up soon",40
I hate the IPL :(,4
Calling an SRH batting collapse on this pitch,3
Ahhhh shittt,2
RCB back to their roots,2
Choke choke chokersssss,3
at this point mi is more scared of kxip and rr than rcb and dc,5
Mumbai is gonna win this IPL really easily man,2
"IPL is in final stages, still RCB couldn't decide on Opener.",8
Rashid be like you really trying to hit me ? ME?,0
 there is much dew out hope we don't  end up giving too many full toses,3
lovely. fully erect now,2
No batting left to play almost half of the overs,3
I have no idea why RCB are playing 4 pacers today lol,7
Why RCB? Why do you do this? Why ? Why do you give us this pain ?,3
RCB batsmen are more determined to get a 100 strike rate rather than 100 runs,3
RCB know the true meaning of bro code,3
Lol all 3 wickets were catches right into the laps of the fielders. Proper RCB fall this.,6
Fuck me. Every year man. Fucking srh you shitwads.,46
DC and RCB ensuring that somethings are normal even if this is 2020.,5
Guys this game is far from over. We couldn't chase 126 ffs,11
That was the worst ball Rashid bowled this spell,2
Our entire team can get injured but if you just leave Rashid we'll still be competitive.,5
"It‚Äôs Gurkeerat time. 


Said noone ever.",9
wtf RCB,3
"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why most teams just play out Rashid",10
I hate SRH wow,5
Untested Middle Order^TM,3
Rashid's wrong one is leg break,3
Is Gurkeerat in form?,2
"I will take anything more than 120, thank you very much",1
All I know is pain,3
Akkan Shaata guru. Why RCB.. Why RCB.. kak thooo.,3
0(0) and 0(0) batsman,2
Common sense has left RCB,4

Long face Gurkeerat is here!,1
"SRH you don't need the NRR, pls go easy and we will hand you the 2 points in the 20th over, okay?",9
King Rashid Khan is lethal,3
might actually be the right situation for gurkeerat to prevent a collapse,5
fuck I feel bad for RCB fans man,8
So looking at RCB I feel we will lose the last match too against DC and again will be get bashed by literally every other teams fan :),9
[deleted],6
"Warner, Saha, Kanos are more than enough to win this",10
Rashid you motherfucking god,3
Rashid - shit. This is not even challenging anymore.,2
Why is RCB treating Sharjah like Abu Dhabi?,3
"Come on RR/kxip/KKR guys we should be supporting srh, we've to expect rcb lose this and the next one too badly and still one of our three would have a chance to replace rcb on the top half",2
"""yeah phillipe's a promising youngster"" rashid in the post match probably",5
Can I have the same thing that Mark Nicholas is having?,3
Somehow get the score to 100-4 in 17 overs . Morris can take it to 150 in 20 overs,1
This Kelvin kid is irritating as hell and his mom too.,2
Here I was thinking it'll be a dead cert RCB win...,3
[removed],23
Hope they stop them around 110/120 max.,1
My boy Udana is going to launch some balls out of the park and save the day for the bewdas.,2
"I don't even bowl this well in cricket 19 üòë

This man is unreal!",5
"What a shame that off all the teams to start winning at the business end of the tournament, potentially only 1 will make it to the playoffs. Other than MI in first place of course",2
"Safe to say neither RCB nor DC is winning the IPL. It's all MI's to take with a bit of competition from KXIP/RR/SRH, whoever makes it.",21
What a boring match this gonna be now.Both DC and RCB don't deserve play offs.,10
"Gurkeerat could have come in at 4 , would have been perfect for him with spin operating from both ends",1
Calling it right now. This is 180-190 pitch and rcb mindless batting is making it look like otherwise. Srh will chase the total easily.,12
"Side note: What‚Äôs the fun in being an MI fan? No calculating, no ups and downs, no depression.",12
Lmao DC vs RCB will be such a meme match.,3
"Went to kitchen then pee, what did miss? 3 wickets? Fuck me",3
RCB could declare rn and I still wouldn't feel confident about chasing this down. Everything the potential to be too far for our batting lineup,6
"BC, just play out Rashid. Got a free 5 wides already, ffs.",9
"Manish and Saha need to hit out or get out.

They aren't good enough to play the anchor innings on this sticky pitch.

Also, Williamson should be in at 3. Perfect pitch for him to win us the chase.",1
RCB and DC choking hard at the business end. Finally some normalcy in 2020,26
it's pretty much a foregone conclusion mumbai gonna win ipl. no side has the balance they've got. might as well enjoy the race for the other playoff spots while we can,13
"In the last Sharjah match (KKR vs KXIP), 150 was not sufficient batting first.....is RCB screwed?",1
"Philippe be like, 

Lost ABD 4 balls ago. 

What shall I do? 

Build a small partnership and prevent Kohlapse? 

Naah

Let me try to hit a BIG six, that too off Rashid fucking Khan.",39
I obviously don't watch a whole lot of T20 leagues but I don't think I have ever seen anyone play Rashid better than Matt Renshaw the last 2 or 3yrs. Won't get to see him sweep Rashid to death any more now that they will both be playing for the Strikers now.,6
RCB and DC trying there best not to get the No 2 spot in the points table,6
Are RCB playing a batsmen short? Wtf are these remaining batsmen Gurukreet Washington Morris.,6
"Can this middle order shine.
PLEASE SHINE",3
DC RCB and imo KXIP are cursed teams,6
Rashid looks pissed everytime his economy goes above 6 lol,10
**RCB to SRH:** Spank me and call me Nancy already.,3
RCB wants to ruin its net run rate too now.,6
If pitches are slow try playing sweep and lap shots for 1s & 2s against spinners,3
"I can't remember the last time a rcb batsman not named abd, kohli or Gayle played a blinder of an innings..",5
Morris is a powerful hitter... We need more wickets... No chances...,2
Who would have thought that Phillipe was better off narrowly missing the ball than to connect with it.,3
Peak braindead from the batting. Everyone whose name isn't Josh needs to look themselves in the mirror tonight. So glad this team is my backup,3
Okay now I'm worried about Chahal and Sundar. I hope Kane handles them well because our middle order can't.,5
"Batsmen: *take on Rashid and get out

Also batsmen: il fucking do it again",7
"It really is shameful that at least one of DC or RCB will definitely be in that #2 spot, as one of them will get to 16 points. And the other is likely to still make the playoffs. Frankly, both teams are in terrible form.

I'd have rather seen KXIP and either RR or SRH make the playoffs instead of DC (trash) and RCB (chokers).",3
The only positive if RCB bails out of this IPL is that AB gets to go Home early.,7
"I think 56 matches are too much for 3 grounds, pitch slowed a lot",2
We can shit all we want on Kohli for playing anchor role. Now we can see what happens if he doesn't stay at crease. Proof of concept right here,13
Josh must've been High to try to hit Rashid,5

"AAR CEE BEE, come one. WIN IT!",1
The collapse vs Kings XI is going to cost SRH a place in the top 2.,3
"Don't say it

Don't say it

Don't say it

Holding back abd was not a bad idea.",18
"I had a ""hum to dube hae sanam"" joke ready but Dube isn't playing :(",6
It‚Äôs guaranteed. We are gonna witness a Chahal 34(8),10
"If SRH somehow manage to qualify despite all these injuries, this team will attain legend status!!!",24
[removed],11
Guys remember that SRH couldn‚Äôt chase 126. Idk I‚Äôm just being hopeful this game is done,7

What‚Äôs the plan now for RCB?,2
I can see Parthiv opening next match before HaarCB is knocked out of the tournament,9
Can RCB and DC both not make it to playoffs?,10
"If RCB can somehow get to 135-140, and if the surface is truly going to get harder to bat on. 

Getting Warner and Saha out is like 80 percent of the task vs Sunrisers. The only team with a worse middle order than RCB is Sunrisers.",17

Why Rcb why do you always find ways to break my heart?,8
Now we know how rcb fans feel.,6
RCB‚Äôs batting depth is horrendous,17

Please atleast reach 150 odd. RR winning in 16th will really fuck up things for KXIP.,5
Give Kane the ball you fools,7

Woah Trevor Bayliss is bald. Um he does a good job covering it,3
Not related but I miss Shaun Marsh in the IPL,7

My vote is for Abd.",8
"Ab was looking set to get a big one today, just needed little luck to go his way",7
"Is this good bowling, bad batting or the pitch is slow? We need the lordest Siraj today to win this.",7
A Aron Finch died for this,18
ABD shifted the gears a bit too early.,21
gurkeerat won us a game v sunrisers last year right? hope he can do it again,10
"BC DC aur RCB dono chutiya team hain aage jo bhi ho!

T: DC and RCB are into shithousery no matter what happens next!",6
I looked at the schedule 2 weeks back and saw rcb last match  was against dc and thought it would be a dead rubber considering both would easily make into playoffs.. Only to realise the winning team would end up being the 2 ND place team and the losing team could very well get eliminated from the ipl,10
"If only SRH had not bottled that chase against punjab their chances to qualify would have been more, now they have to beat MI next match.

This is on you Manish",13
Drag urself to 150+ somehow someway R¬©B,3
"Washi is middling it, but so was AB and Virat",1
Why would Kohli on top of this try to be over-confident and say he wanted to bat first?,4
The advice to RCB and DC is either get rain seeding technology in place for Monday or dig up the pitch. That way both of you go through.,10
"What a poor squad.
Always been.",5

"TBH CSK bitched so much about missing out on a past-his-prime Raina in the initial stages of the tournament and were victimizing themselves. They had two weeks to sign a replacement yet they chose not to. 

Sunrisers lost their designated finisher (Mitch Marsh), their best pacer (Bhuvi) both in the first week yet at no point have they even stopped competing or used it as an excuse for sloppy performances. 

Gotta give a lot of credit to Warner. I doubt if the likes of Natarajan would have thrived under a captain like Koach.",23
"for fucks sake, somebody take the mike away from Anjum Chopra.",8
"Natarajan very well replaced Mushfiqur Rahim's place in SRH, and also eased up a foreign spot.",4

How this SRH team is even contending despite all the injuries and the weak middle order just reflects Warner's passion. He should even be forgiven for the Sandpaper incident by now...I know all SRH fans have",19
I would prefer to see RCB getting all out than watching Gurkeerat playing test cricket,9
140 is minimum if we want to have any miniscule hope of defending this,10
How is the Hindi commentary? I can't take anymore of Sunny Gs shit,4
Did you have to beat us that other day CSK?,34
SRH is going to win this by 8 wickets isn't it,7
"No.5 and No.6 for MI: Pandya and Pollard

Why did RCB drop dube for an additional seamer?,5
Murali or Bayliss: who has the better belly?,1
It makes sense to play out all the overs if you think your team has lost too many wickets. It is also advised to score runs while you play out those overs...,10
"Some hilarious cricket rock for musical accompaniment:

"Question about hitting Sixes. Sanga goes first. Goes on a solid 2 minute detailed reply. Over to Sunny G's turn who has the easiest answer ever. Simply:

Agreed!",16
I just stumbled across a Barmy Army tweet wishing Warner a happy birthday with a video of Broad getting him out. The replies were all angry SRH fans lol,60
Why isn‚Äôt Gayle playing again?,6
"Being an RCB fan is a skill at this point. Only people with extremely strong hearts and minds can watch this shit team. I'm literally laughing out of pure anger and sadness, next to me my sister is crying because the poor woman actually had hope. No no, RCB fans don't have access to hope. It's an alien feeling for us. She'll learn the hard way after this game. Fuck this team",45
I think 140 is defendable score considering Washi n chahal bowling on this gripping pitch,7
Wtf she mean by they have been in good form,6
"Why the fuck is this tongue twister moron naked and showering. Why couldn't he do the same tongue twister with clothes on?

And this was the best model they could get?",37

This is a slow wicket where ABD scored 24(24).

"150? Even 135 is looking like a stretch from here.

Ultimate script by the IPL writers - RCB vs DC is both the shit teams last match,3
At least get 140+,1
Even Sanga is shilling for Altroz. Oouch,5
Fucking RCB and DC. Shit the bed against other teams and murder us.,7
Parthiv Patel has now completed his transformation into Coach Mike Hesson. Look very similar now,9
What happened to Dube? Thought he was ok in the few times he played,2
RCB really needs a good pinch hitter that is not AB,5
Gold standard car?,1
Looks like 150 is a competitive total,2

"All my fellow RCB supporters, say it with me:

*Washi bhai will take us to victory today*",12
"The thing with MI is that if you have them 4 down they would have Hardik and Pollard batting, not Gurkeerat and Sundar.",6
Why was Gurkeerat playing over Dube again?,2
Gurkeerat has joined Thala Academy,0
"Sanga, I mean, c'me on dude, the forced ""stylish car"" endorsement doesn't fit your stature.",7
"Bangar is spreading the ""boundary following by single - sensible batting"" contamination to Dugout.",4

"Fulltosses straight to midwicket! Ah, RCB is truly back.",2
[deleted],7
Gurkeerat is rated very highly by Virat for his choice in Punjabi music. And ofcourse he can bat so that's a bonus ‚ù§Ô∏è,21
What do you mean Gurkeerat has played 41 IPL matches?,18
RCB don't deserve a playoff spot at this point. Good teams need to qualify. And usually good teams have a middle order. I can't seem to find one in this team.,-1
"If Gurkeerat doesn‚Äôt perform, he‚Äôll be the scapegoat. Even when he complimented ABD well during the RR game, people were ready to pin the blame on him before the result.",15

"Guys whatever be the results be, what according to you are the best 4 teams to qualify.",2
"MI has Hardik and Pollard at 5 and 6, we have Sundar and Gurkeerath.",8
Lol Sundar is a bowler primarily and he's doing a better job with the bat than loser Shitkeerat,0
"Chahal's mandatory 1 wicket isnt gonna cut it today, he gotta get atleast 3",4
Imagine if RCB had retained KL Rahul instead of Negi,5
140 would be impossible to chase for us. Heck after that last chase I don't even know if we can chase 120.,1
Imo Dube or Negi would be a far better option than gurkeerat,3
RCB & DC are like those middle schoolers desperately waiting to hit pubery & growth spurt. They have been perpetually stuck at 14 for an eternity.,6
"Warner after this match : ""Alexa play ButtaBomma""",8
It really is fascinating to see that RCB middle order options are so bad that absolutely worthless player like Gurkeerat gets a consistent run with no problem.,5

"Now they should go Sandy, Rashid, Nattu, Holder, Nattu",1
Pathetic batting line up. Its just 4 wickets down and feels like tail enders are on the crease.,7

Suryakumar > Whole RCB team,5
Morris should have come in instead of mann,2
"Srh and Deccan Chargers before have always have a good bowling lineup. I guess since Deccan had one and srh retained a lot of those players, that good bowling has carried on with the franchises.",5
Gurkeerat's batting technique looks so unimpressive that I don't expect more than a run a ball from him.,3
TIL Gurkeerat's favourite player is Dhoni,5
Start going at it. Morris to come.,1
Warner going for the kill.,3
"When you visit Thala: Autographed T-shirt

When Thala visits you: 4(11)",6
"130+ is competitive here. With Morris to come, SRH needs to aggressively look for a wicket instead of letting these two build a partnership.",4
If RCB loses today by a big margin then we'll have a wild match on Monday when the winner of DC vs RCB will go to the top-2 and the loser may very well be eliminated.,3
thats got to hurt....ouch,3
"Man I'm done with these commentators disrespecting Phillipe. Now Sanga and Gavaskar discussing how RCB can solve their opening ""problem"" and how Sundar opening can be solution. 

Yeah fuck you, too bad RCB's highest run scorer today was Josh Philippe, the kid you lot can't seem to give a fucking ounce of credit to. 

Did they speak a word when Kohli and Paddikal padded hundreds of inconsequential runs at 100 SR in different games in the season?",8
Dick before Wicket ?,2
Anjum Chopra is telling stuff which any 5 year old can also decipher. Next she will tell he just has to hit the ball over the rope for a 6,3
Dammit Mann hit something ffs,3
"Honestly very ordinary batting especially from Kohli, he hasn‚Äôt shown up in any important games. I feel bad for Philippe or Padikkal because either of them have to play in order to put up a decent total.",2
Dube should have played today mahn fuck this,2
This batting lineup is so frustrating to watch,3
"Gurkeerat, please do a Tewatia.",3
Still not enough runs on board for Warner and Saha's century partnership,2
Gutkeerat with nice 5 balls 12 runs. Wait,3
Gurkeerat playing a solid test knock,5
RCB is a fucking meme team. Their batting order ends at fucking 4!,8
SKY fucked the confidence out of RCB last match with the revenge innings,6
"Sandeep Sharma is underrated as fuck, why the hell didn't we retain him",2
RCB must be relegated.,3
Does gurkeerat play well in the domestics or something?,2
"Gurkeerat, Rishi Dhawan and Barinder Sran all played for India against Australia in 2016.",7
Wait a minute did she just say Rashid will get the purple cap if he gets another wicket? I‚Äôm pretty sure he has 18 wickets while Bumrah has 23,8
"If we aren't playing the same team then,

We must open with Parthiv and play Moeen in the middle order.

Only option left",2
our expectations were low but HOLY FUCK,5
Man fuck these guys. Get out and allow Morris please,1
mark my words gurkeeraats gonna do a tewatia now,3
What a shot Sundar,2
"Was watching the new Borat Movie between the matches saw the first 15 mins, holy shit it's hilarious. Next level shiz.",2

"next ball wicket?

edit: wait, did i fucking call it??!

edit 2: would've been a great catch tho",5

25 on Rashid aaand we have lost this year gg see you next year.,2
Gurkeerat pls hit or get out and bring morris in. This seems like an ideal situation for morris,1
Rashid Khan's economy this season so far is just above 5 per over. Insane..!,2
SRH better  not take Gurkeerat's wicket and bring Morris in,2
These two have rotated well to finish.. SRH needs some control and Morris early,1
Are you kidding me?,2
What a catch.,1
Specialist Fielder^TM,3
Brilliant timing from Washi Bhai,3
Pandey is superman xD,5
Wtf,2

But what actually happened lol?!",3
"Fuck me, that's a great catch if it carried",1
Pandey ji whats with suspense?,2
Please god no,3
SRH should not be lethargic here. Games turn in one over,3
Pandey LMAO,10
Got clickbaited while watching cricket,9
That was a moment of silence for RCB and its fans by Manish Pandey,6
Is it a catch or not bc Manish clear bol,3
Honest boi strikes again,7
Dhoni giving signed t shirts ? He is the Gilderoy Lockhart,6
manish pandey with some kiri kiri,3
Did Pandey ji drop a turd he was tryna hide?,2
If Manish is in doubt then it‚Äôs not out lol,31
Manish Pandey is a cutie,5
Keep calm and believe in Washi,3

So what was Pandey doing there wtf?,8
Wtf Pandey? How can you do that?,4

Give Manish a Oscar,13
Well that's not fair play.,12
Oh thank you,4
Manish being sneaky xD,4
Ohhh look that third umpire sounds like my chemistry teacher,5
Ah come on. Why not just say no catch straight away.,5
"Not a good over to bowl out Rashid. They didn't mind playing him out, have free reign for the last 4 now",1
The fuck Pandey lmao,6
Pandey casually fucking with more than 30Lakh viewers,11
How tf were you high fiving that lol,6
bruh even RCB fans are sad that the decision is not out ffs,6
"What the fuck, just wasted our time.",18
Legendary James Bond actor Sean Connery has passed away,9
Weird seeing rashid go for 24 in 4,3
fair play points gone,4
Gurkeerat needs to fuck off now.,4
"Pandey wasting everyone's time

Will also lose fair play points",2
Lool what was that about Pandey just tell them it wasn't out,4
"Manish ""Pointing"" Pandey",7
That‚Äôs kinda cheating from Pandey,8
It's amazing he got a hand to it,3
Aji lawda ka catch hai,4
All that shit acting for this shit?,4
Gurkeerat better do a Tewatia or bring Morris in....,3
pandey bruh,3
"Great effort tho, saved a 4.",1
4d chess by Pandey to stop batsmen from running.,20
The fuck?,2
Wait what just happened. I'm only following on cricbuzz. The commentary went from out to no run.,1
3rd umpire is quick,2
"This was poor from Pandey. Excellent fielding effort, but this he clearly saw that he had dropped.",6
Are you kidding me? Why tf did he appeal for that?,6
We should atleast get the fair play award /s,7
Maarde Bhai Gurkeerat ab toh,2
Pandey wanted a wicket just for the fielding effort,5
WTF was that from Manish,6
Gurkeerat get out ffs and let Morris smash it,7
Gurkeerath pls it's time to go. Morris is in the dugout ffs.,3
Rcb hit hundred we have lost this.,5
"Fucker Pandey, wasting time.",6
"Fielder has half a second to realize what happened while he's in the air.

r/cricket: LiAr",9
Great fielding nevertheless,6
We reach 100!!! Moral victory,2
He told no right away,4
Dont mind Pandey guys. There's no thrill watching this boring match so he decided to make suspense on his own,11
*Ahmed Shahzad feels threatened rn*ü§°,3
Why did that go upstairs? Never looked out at any point,2
99-4 off 102 balls.... Rcb wtf is this,4
Not sure those 2 were picking Rashid there!!,3
Gurkeerat fuck you,9
Kamaal karte ho Pandey ji...,5
Gurkeerat needs to go Tewatia mode to redeem himself that SR is shit,8
Gurkeerat has more tattoos than he has runs today,8
I feel like the reason why Dhoni gives away his t-shirt is to promote his upcoming Tshirt brand called Dhoni.,7
Fuck should have been caught,2
That would have been a boundary for most other fielders,8
Fake catch lmaoooo,3
Come on Gurkeerat hit or get out for Morris,5
Are the players and umpires asked to advertise for PayTM by taking simple decisions to the third umpire? Possible imo,3
Good strategy to bank fair play points /s,4
"Manish ""Ahmed Shehzad"" Pandey. Only thing left is asking a cricketer to convert to Hinduism",2
Pandey eyeing that fairplay award,6
Pandey hoping that the camera dropped a few frames,9
TBH Pandey immediately shook his head and did not ask for it to be taken upstairs.,7
Should have sent Morris over gurkeerat,3
Money on Mr. Mann to do a Tewatia and bring up a 170+ total.,3
Shehzad sent friend request to Pandey,3
Anyone tell me wtf Gurkeerat is doing in the team.,2
Did Gurkeerat take Thalas jersey last match by any chance?,2
I'm conflicted. He knows 3rd umpire will see and give not out. Then why?,3
What was that from Pandey. Surely he knew he didn't catch it lol,4
"So, is that positive points or negative points for SRH in the fair play table?",4
Get Gurkeerat Out man bring in MORRRRIS,4
why did punjab release sandy?,2
Gurkeerat had Kohlis nudes confirmed,3
Wtf is Gurkeerat doing dude rotate strike.,3
Guys RCB is only 4 down?! Wtf HIT,8
I LOVE SWANN,1
"GURKEERAT nanna magane, FUCKIN FLOOR IT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.",4
Full toss for a single.....shit,3
Gurkeerat fuck off. We need morris in,3
If only there was Steve bucknor umpiring. Would've been out,3
Manish dropped the fair play award there,7
That was just... Weird. Almost like he forgot this was in front of a dozen cameras,6
"Under one tip one hand rules, that was clearly out",6
I cant believe that Manish Pandey was unsure about that catch. It dropped in front of him.,2
[deleted],2
Strategic drop by pandey,2
Game on if rcb get to 140.,3
Unpopular opinion but Graham Swann is insufferable,4
Is it possible for Gurkeerat to redeem himself by pulling off a Tewatia or am I just being overly optimistic,4
Gurukeerat Singh Dhoni,1
Gurkeerat hit out or get out. We want Morris,1
Where the fuck are your big hitters RCB?,1
HOLY FUCK GURKEERAT DO SOMETHINGGGGGGGGG,3
Why didn't they run while pandey was just sleeping there,1
Gurkeerat looks truly mediocre.,1
6D chess by SRH not trying to take chances created by Guruji,1
How can they seriously think Gurkeerath is better than Dube?,6
Gurkeerat ü§ù Jadhav,6
one question: on what basis would you select gurkareet in?,2
4 wickets down and mann is batting like he is saving test match,5
"Pandey staying on the floor for a long time, thinking whether to claim the catch and calculating the possibility that cameras wouldnt spot the ball hitting the ground. 

It was so clear, he also knew it. He cannot be unsure of it. He took a chance anyway.",5
Back in the days this is what I used to do when asked did I took all the tape out of the cassette.,2
"Surely, they are gonna start hitting now?",3
Gurkeerat get out you dickhead,4
GURKEERAT YOU GOOD FOR NOTHING!,1
What is Gurkeerat doing?,2
RCB should be fined for making our Saturday evening boring as hell.,6
Gurukeerat's shots are not even reaching the boundary line fielders. smh,2
Gurukeerat can't even reach the fielder,1
Half expect the next 3 overs to go for 50,3
"Remember Akshdeep Nath?

It's Gurkeerat now

Feeling old yet? :)",6
"Exactly what is Gurkeerat's role in the lineup? To suck the life out of the game or to just turn the strike over?

No _intent_ today, else they'd have sent Morris out.",5
"What is it called when Washington is torn into pieces?

Washington Asunder",12
Pandey was not convinced he took the catch. Stop blaming our boy!,8
They don't want to get Gurkeerat out!,4
If MI was in this condition we would have been seeing Pollard and Pandya show now and look what we have here :(,2
SRH field placements are on point,3
GURKEERAT YOU POS DO SOMETHING GOOD MAN YOU BLOODY F,6
Gurkeerat you're doing great.,5
I'm feeling so angry...can't watch,3
"Gurkeerat you better pull off a Tewatia now, nor else RCB fans along with KKR, KXIP, RR fans will be extremely angry on you.",6
Dube is average but still much better than Gurkeerat,4
Lol Gurkeerat is the one who gets saved by the lights. Pretty sure Morris and Udana coming in now and going for it is RCBs best shot,3

Get run out pls Mann,5

"Gurkeerat mann. More like gurkeerat man what are you doing

Gurkeerat is shit. Change my mind.,5
Can RCB be eliminated from the playoffs?,1
Agent Gurkeerat should improve his strike rate by 60% by going from 7(14) to 20(25).,5
Gurkeerat doesn‚Äôt deserve to be in a tournament of this standard,5
Shit Mann is fucking useless. Kill yourself. You're no TEWATIA!!! /s,1
Washie trying to get Gurkeerat run out. Good on you mate.,5
Get the fuck out and bring Morris you idiots. Don't ruin my Saturday,4
"RCB is the lanky lefties club - DDP, Moeen, SDube, Washi",6

gurkeerat singh man",5
"If one didn't know how shit RCB, KXIP and DD have always been, they would think this is all scripted.",3
Stop being Harsh on Gurkareet.,2

Gurkeerat might as well hit or get out bcoz he isn‚Äôt making any runs and is even struggling to rotate strike,3
"Fuck you gurkeerat, you stupid freeloading twat",3
"Next year, hope we buy Tewatia for Gurkeerat please",7
Criticize Warner‚Äôs capitancy all you want but the field placement today has been on point,9
140+ and good chances SRH will choke after warner and kanes wickets,8
Gukeerat and Hooda for Kings XI are two of the worst #6's I've seen.,3
Rashid with a 6 economy. Disappointing day for SRH,7
"RCB get to 120.

*Sad DC noises*",3
Lmao gurkeerat is so shit he can't even get out if he wanted to,7
"*I like how Koach will just copy paste his last match post match speech (btw which he is reusing since 2017)*

'It was a strange phase of batting (the last five overs of the RCB innings). Everything went to the fielders and these kind of things happen. They bowled in good areas in the last 5 overs and stopped us 20 runs short.'",5
Gurkeerat has not a single T20 innings in the tourney and I don't know how he is still in the team. Sundar is batting better than this guy.,2
Rcb could have really used moeen right about now,4
Dube died for this.,10

"Gurkeerat is trying to impress selectors for test selection, someone tell him it's late now.",6
srh will be praying that these two don't get out.,5

"Gurkeerat would be better up the order , at least Ab could have been around for these final overs , is Parthiv worse than this guy ?",3

"SRH jeez, drop a catch ffs.",1
Morris is gonna end us. I feel it,3
So r/cricket has got a scapegoat in Gurkeerat today.,4
Gurkeerat has to be the worst buy of this season. Worst strike rate in the entire series. Wtf was the management smoking when they bought him,3
Just 1 six in Shar Jah. Abysmal batting.,2

Dube is inconsistent but atleast he can hit.,3
Hope MI beats SRH,1
RCB you beauty!!! Keeping the tournament alive and wide open.  They are the unsung heroes.,5
Well Rcb and Dc finally showing what they have been doing till this year,6

Natraj hurting me both with that wicket and that beard,7
Gurkeerat finally picks up a wicket lmao,7
Rcb and dc trying their best to not qualify,3
Can some one please explain that Cadbury add to me.,3
Fuck you man RCB doing this shit when you need 1 win to qualify. Fuck you,6
Mann doing what Manish does when he usually comes on,2
Someone please ban this gavaskar idiot. üòñ,1
Totally forgot they have Morris.,0
"As much as RCB was doing well, I still hold on to what I said. Finch was a really useless buy for RCB. PP was doing really well for us last year, and also kept pretty well. We needed a lower order whacker, could have bought a guy like Neesh with that money",3
Dude this nattu guy is a good good find üíØ,0
Rcb and dc are the anti kxip,2
RCB shouldn‚Äôt qualify. This is painful.,3

Tactical drop,6
[deleted],7
I'm convinced Koach doesn't even know that Udana can bat.,6
RCB should target to reach around 140. Get Warner out early and SRH could choke.,3
Gurkeerat has batted only 31 times in 8 years in the IPL. Can't expect anything special from him. But how the hell did he manage to play for India? Must have had a hell of a domestic season.,4
Sandy dropped that catch deliberately. Mann is worthless!,8
What an ugly shot,5
Tactical decision right there.,4
Jadhav is to csk is what gurkeerat is to rcb?,3
Pretty sure this piece of shit was dropped intentionally.,5
Difficult to catch those but boundary is shit bro!,2
WTF Sandeep? Seriously man WTF?,5
You guys are right. Gurkeerat keeps trying to throw his wicket and keeps failing,5
"Gurkeerat, not even kidding when I say you're perhaps playing the worst death over innings I have watched recently. This is coming from a CSK fan by the way.",4
Tactical drop there by Sandeep,6
Should have been 2-5 smh,2
Rcb thinking this pitch is slow can't hit boundaries so let's take singles..sure Srh will finish target in 15 overs..rcb will be like wtf did we batting conditions were poor,8
Is gurkeerat doing a Tewatia??,2
"Gurkeerat, the legend. Too hot for SRH fielders",4
"TIL Gurkeerat is a capped player

Can't believe.",3
Gurkeerat worst batsman in the IPL?,1
"I hope RCB and DC find a way to tie or N/A their last game, finish with 14 points and negative NRR, and both get disqualified.

I'd like to see SRH, RR, KKR or KXIP take the other 3 playoff spots.",2
That's a wide surely,2
Everyone in this sub to gurkerat: Why are u gay,3
He dropped it so that he can play more dots /s,4
"RCB really must be thanking the stars for being within touching distance of the playoffs. This is perhaps the worst batting lineup they've had in a long long time. All those years they shat the bed, they were known to be a fearsome batting unit. This year they're anything but intimidating. 

TBF their batting ends at 4 and the only impact player in the entire batting unit is AB. Sure you can pull up Kohli and Paddikal's numbers this season, but how many games have they won this season? Or how many games have their innings had an impact on the game without AB not having to do his magic? One or maybe two, at best. 

Unless and until AB goes mad, I really can't see them even reaching the final. Even look at the previous game - Padikkal scored 70 odd, they were 90 odd in 10 overs but what's the use? AB failed and everything came crashing down.",8
Inside the line. Brilliant!,1
I want Morris to do well but I also want RCB to collapse so that we're not the only collapse of the day.,3
They don't want to catch Gurkeerat. Tactics.,3
"If RCB comes out and bowls 140+, not having learnt from the CSK game AND this innings, I swear, after 13 years, I'll stop following them, for real",28
That looked deliberate lmao,4
Impressive stuff from Nattu,7
8D Chess from Sandeep,8
Nattu sad for his economy than for dropped catch,2
Lmao Gurkeerat is so getting kicked out,5
Looks like Sandeep Sharma doesn't want Nattu to have a better economy than him /s,6
Why does Natarajan's beard hang the way my mask does when it's on my chin,6
"So rcb have scored more than us already, moral defeat",11
"I love Gayle so I hope kxip win this cup, they really are a match winning side",3
Morris will now score the runs which he'll inevitably give away in the last balls of each of his over,4
guys wish me luck im outside the stadium waiting for a ball,10
Gurkeerat is playing a totally shit innings,6
Told ya it was a tactical drop,6
In b4 cricinfo shows that the drop actually saved srh some runs,28
There is DC RCB match otherwise both teams don't seem to be in any mood to win any match,3
"If we can get warner and Williamson out early, we might have a pitch",4
How could they possibly rate this guy ffs,5
Gurkeerat's bat speed doesn't look like he can hit a six or four. Fucking atleast try to swing the bat,6
They are not even attempting to score big. Just swing.,2

Anyone still defending gurkeerat? Fucking trash.,4
Playing for stumps!,0
"Gurkeerat has scored 64 runs this IPL in 71 balls without getting out or hitting a six, while batting in the death. weird stats.",6
I remember Gurkeerat only for an absolute blinder of a catch he took at square leg. SuperMann memes for a few weeks. Nothing with the bat though I can recall.,3
"Commentators were shitting on my boi Philippe by saying 'he doesnt belong and all', while he was finding the boundary from time to time. Where are those comments for Gurkeerat who is playing perhaps one of the worst T20 knocks of all time?",9
"Open with chahal and sundar and try to get Warner early. If he stays through the powerplay the game is gone. And this lineup has kane, they won't collapse like vs kings xi.",8

111. Wicket incoming,5
Lmao calm down idiots. Gurkeerat stopped a kohllapse here. Rcb would have been 80 all out.,5
"What can Gurkeeret do , that Dube can't. What's the point him being in team",7

Warner's gonna cunt Siraj today as a trailer of test series,7
Come on Gurkeerat ......Good time to secure your spot on the team with some great hitting,3
This guy Gurkeerat almost cost RR vs rcb match. Still he's playing,6

What a terrible inning from Gurkeerat,5
"Second half of IPL is just like IPL a decade back, CSK winning, RCB duh, DC being DD and Gayle still the huge hitter",9
They eek out a 140 here and baby we got a stew going.,4
mann up!,2
Gurukeerat is so bad,2
Why couldn‚Äôt he have put down Ab like that,3
"So srh bros, how will we fuck this one up?",6
OH RCB please atleast make 130 like really? wtf happened? ABD and Virat only batsman in the team,3
Nattu looks like hes put on a decent bit of muscle in the last few months.,3
We need to find another good Indian batsman,2

Someone like Dube can hit big.. dont get why Gurkeerat is being selected over him,5

Royal Capitals Bangalore,8
Moris thank you for coming. Please don't forget to take Thaamboola on your way out.,9
Gurkeerat's inability to rotate strike or connect ball is costing us wickets. Putting pressure on other batsman. This guy has no intent. Morris steps in starts to hit ball he can't even cross the pitch length? Why does Koach keep him in team?,6
"omg, holder is a giant!",5
Scriptwriters want to keep the tournament interesting for those sweet sweet moolah.,2
i love swanny,4
"Umpire: *Declares 1 wicket*

Morris not being to able to hit a Holder full-toss in Sharjah reallly shows his quality as a batsman. That's what he had been doing in DC for 2 seasons now and that's why he was released.,1
Maybe Holder doesn't know that that gesture is for white supremacy,2

"A journeyman from Punjab, Gurkeerat's IPL career began with his home-based franchise, Kings XI Punjab, in 2012. In only his second game playing for the franchise, came a match-winning 12-ball 29 in a run-chase. Always a part of the fringe, his cameos were useful in the larger context of the match. His ability to hit big and long and his useful off-breaks, coupled with his fielding abilities - makes him an attractive package for any franchise. In fact, his catch to dismiss Ross Taylor was voted as the 'catch of the tournament' in 2013.",9

How is RCB #2 in the points table?,6
Siraj with that helicopter,3
Lord Siraj with the helicopter shot.,4
Gurkeerat would slot right into the RCB Test team of 2008.,3
Damn Helicopter Shot from Siraj,2
last mann standing...i'll check myself out,3
Gurkeerat is good for nothing.,2
Siraj playing helicopter shot for 1,3
Is the fact that Saini and Morris are express fast bowlers a good thing or a bad thing on this pitch?,3
Did I just see a helicopter shot?,7
Fuck man Washi was slowly taking them to 130 at least and maybe a push. Now it's dire af,6
Siraj is showing more intent to hit than Gurukeerat,5
Even fucking siraj hitting it cleaner than gurkeerat,8
I though rcb vs DC would be a best of the two would get a chance to play mumbai and now I realise the one who shits less will qualify,5
"Lol. Just watch SRh easily chase this target down. Apparently slow pitch is only applicable to RcB. 

I don‚Äôt even get the logic of playing Gurkeerat. He can‚Äôt even hit. He absolutely sucks. Whoever of DC and RcB make the top 2 will be the most undeserving in history",11
Typical SRH crushing RCB dreams since 2016.,11
How many imposters do we have I have lost count,9
Lmao Helicopter shot from Lord Siraj,10
[RCB fans right now](https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2019-06-13/240225_110636_updates.jpg),6
Yes this TVC sir. Give me the link to the music!,2
discount  helicopter,5
"Watch out, siraj pulling out the helicopter shots",2
Siraj helicopter?!,2
Gurk 50(26)*,0
Siraj Helicopter?,2
Mumbai RCB SRH Kings11 is going to be top4,2
14(20) nice,3
I see that helicopter attempt Siraj,7
Kane is the key here,6
"It's actually gonna be so good to have 6 teams competing for playoff places going into the final round of matches, with only one team confirmed to be knocked out and only one team confirmed for qualification",5
Grand salute for Gurkeerat,2
RCB collapse is making me feel better... Which is odd considering they're my second favourite team.,6
This kingfisher add sucks right ???,1
Siraj Helicopter shot üòÇ,7
Man Kane looks so good with a beard.,4
Yes Siraj. Keep that strike away from Gurubhai,1
Either RCB is total shit at batting or the pitch is difficult and SRH will struggle to chase here,4
Blaming Gurkeerat is bit rich when the others are falling like dead weights,10
Siraj remembering MS Thala,2
Take singles pls,1
I HATE YOU SRH I HATE YOU. I ALMOST HATE YOU AS MUCH AS CSK AND THAT‚Äôs SAYING SOMETHING. UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I HATE YOU THEN.,13
"I don't always bat, but when I do, I always play the helicopter shot. Suck on that, Thala. - Lord Siraj",9
Inb4 the lord blows away nattu with his helicopters,5
Siraj with helicopter. I have seen everything.,4
"Nattu 3 overs 9-1 
Wow",1
Did Siraj just play the helicopter shot?,1
"Fragile Openers, Middle Order big on names but nada on performance. Bowling Lineup has some shades of brilliance also some shades of shit. RCB and DD vibing at another level",5
Nattu with variations!? Fuck yes.,4
"Yo don't swing, we good with 123 or something",2
Guys surprise stat! Gurkeerat has played 3 games for India!!,5
Siraj: look at me I'm the thala now,4
"I'm telling you gurkeerat will play the 30 run over

*while writing this he missed again*",8
"For all you people wanting ABD to bat 2 down no matter which over it is, 

Would you rather have run a ball 30 runs(innings building phase where u can't go bang bang) by ABD coming inside over no. 6? 

Or would you rather have him at the crease in overs 13-20? 

Innings consolidation earlier can be done by other batsmen who can't play big shots later, such as Gurkeerat or someone.",0
Is this what we are down to? Stealing singles from the keeper? Fucking embarrassing state of affairs,3
"He missed the stumps on purpose, I can tell",1
Ngl Ipl script better than a Tarantino movie,6
Trash Gurkeerat,3
Fucking hell. 21 balls gone to trash,3
Dube > Gurkeerat,8
Somehow I feel bad for Siraj,3
That's what even surah did,1
RCB jinxed the whole season by saying they wouldn‚Äôt have to do calculations this year,4
Natarajan wore his mask on the chin for far too long and it gathered all sorts of lint and gunk. Now he's embarrassed to take it off because everyone assumed it was a beard.,3
Omg these 2 idiots can't connect..,6
"I can't believe this shit.

What is Gurkeerat doing?",3
Gurkeerat has been sent to make the IPL interesting,3
Tomorrow we could see 4 teams at 14 points,3
There are cops outside stadium ..no one can grab balls now,1
Dube would've been a better choice over Gurkeerat. Pitch is super slow and we need slower bowlers! All we have is pace!,3
The rat is playing for the tea break,1
Gurkeerat üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,5
Shite rcb vs mega shite dc for the virtual quarterfinal is what i want.,5
inb4 SRH chokes this match.,2
Gurkeerat playing a great cameo for SRH,4
I love Morris but his performance to pay ratio this season is absolute daylight robbery. Quickly establishing himself as discount Morne Morkel - 80% off.,2
"6 teams competing for playoffs, while CSK‚Äôs chilling.",4
Is the Sharjah pitch really slow or rcb not able to make runs??,2
Wicket this ball,2
"Misssed the last 6 overs, what in the world is Gurkeerat even doing? He could have just sit in the dugout and RCB could have benefitted more!",4
"Saha mate, that's why most keepers underarm it",1
"Fuck it, I will just enjoy RCB getting spanked",2
At this point Siraj looks more likely to get a boundary. May be he should be the one farming the strike.,2
So guys match ke baad kya plan hai?,2
Saha's line is good. Length not so much,3
"Pitch seems same as csk vs RCB one, hopefully rcb players don't do what they did against CSK and do use slow balls",1
Nattu's beard looks like he was wearing it and it just slipped down a bit,2
Fun Fact Gurkeerat is much into Politics than Cricket and it shows üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,5
"Pace off is troubling the batsmen, can't wait to see Siraj and Saini bowl nice 140+ pies now.",7
Is gurkeerat generally good and struggling today or is he like hooda?,2
Remember Mushfiqur bowling similar deliveries to Shankar in that final,1
Jadhav = Gurkeerat confirmed,7
"In Gurkeetat's defence, he is swinging the bat.",3
"Lol, Gurkeerat turning down singles - as if he is gonna six",13
Why didn't he run? Omg...,3
Gurkeerat madarchod,8
Trust DC and RCB being so hopeless that both fans are exploring possibilities of qualification at 14 points lol,5
Gurkeerat denying singles . Bruh this man still thinks he can get it,4
Gurkeerat refusing a single lmao,3
Lmao the gall to decline singles now,3
Natarajan deserves an Indian call up,7
Siraj would've done a better job than gurkeerat,7
Wtf???,3
Big Brain Gurkeerat not wanting to rotate strike.,3
Nattu is too good for Gurki. Bairstow should have bowled him,3
Gurkeerat taking strike away from Siraj to score dot balls..,4
Koach does quick 1s & 2s masterclass on a flat track and gets out early on a pitch where you actually need it,5
Give how badly SRH choked the last low run chase I don't have much hope today...,4
You know I was wondering how Gurkeerat didn't get more opportunities with the Indian team because he had a 45 batting average and 30 bowling average... I think I see why now,6
I blame ABD for that stroke play with 9 overs to go,3
RCB's quota for winning certain matches per IPL was over already. So it's obvious they lose matches now.,6
What the actual fuck Gurkeerat EVERY RUN FUCKING COUNTS U AINT DOING SHIT,11
He turns down the single üòÇ,7
Wtf why did he not throw the ball at non striker's end?,5
Gurkeerat you fucking asshole. You are so shit. Wasted one run.,9
Hahahaha Gurpreet not taking that single is hilarious.,3
bro this guy is so bad. Gurkeerat is so bad.,6
Imagine the audacity to deny a single at this point,10
WHY didn‚Äôt he run? Idiot,3
Gurkeerat denying a single? Siraj is probably better than him lmaoooooo,6
Lmao. Gurkeerat doesn't want a single now. This is hilarious.,3
Refused the single for nothing lol,5
Why reject singles mann,9
Denied single lol,7
If there was a mega auction next year this would be the end of Gurkeerat‚Äôs career but it probably still is,10
LMAO,1
Nattu does not even care to bowl his yorkers now. Lol.,4
What. The. Fuck. Chukeerat denied a single.,3
Lmao gurkeerat denying run as if he will touch the ball,6
"On what grounds did gurkeerat refuse a single, smug bastard.. what a fucking idiot",9
Gurkeerat can't even put bat to ball. Looks clueless every time. Why pick him?,6
Gurkeerat engraging half of India rn,7
Why? Why is Guru not running? Chances of Siraj hitting a boundary is high,3
Mann needs the strike to continue from his 14(22),2
Ooooo I sense a meltdown today Lmao,9
gurkeerat playing baseball on a slow cricket pitch,6
Takes a single the next ball. Fucking most useless of this lot of useless.,7
Iska kya logic he bhai üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,1
SRH smiles saying they won it already.,2
Koach should be like 15runs apni Gaad me daal le Gurkeerat bro.,3
Why didn't he throw the ball?,1
Who the fook thought Gurkeerat was a good T20 player,3
"Tamil cricket players are slowly getting into the nation scene. Nattu, Washi, 3D, Murugan Ashwin, Varun Chakravarthy. Should give a few opportunities to these guys in the coming years",9
I can score 0(1) where's my IPL contract at?,9
At this point both RR and KXIP look like more deserving and dangerous teams for playoffs than RCB and DC.,9
Gurkeerat paying tribute to his Punjab teammate Yuvraj with that 14(21),6
Lol. The sheer gall to reject single when you have a strike rate of 60.,13
"Man,the choicest of abuses gurkeerat's gonna get from Kohli.",4
Warner Anna looks proper Tollywood hero,8
Gurkeerat denying single. Wow. Cant hit and denies single as well.,4
How has Gurkeerat played for India but SKY hasn't.....,11
How did Gurkeerat play for India...,1
This is such a depressing Saturday for RCB and DC fans.,8
Pathetic,2
"It's gonna be like mi vs csk match in sharjah, srh openers will teleport and bat on a different pitch",8
Good innings from Gurkeerat overall.,6
Can't hit a boundary but denies singles lol,10
I admire the fact that RCB are at least collapsing by swinging for the fences.,3
Gurkeerat: I am the Thala now.,1
Can't even touch the ball and trying to be a hero.,4
Gurkeerat tuk tuk academy,5
Commentators saying net run rate of rcb is good lol,4
Good fielding Kane mama,3
Siraj with a better stroke than Mann,4
"Refused a single.. to get a single.

Nice.",11
Mohammed *Helicopters Only* Siraj,6
What is r/Cricket tonight assessment on Gurkeerat's innings?,4
If he's denying a single he's inviting memes towards him.,7
All the work we did to get our nrr positive is gonna be undone,1
"Scott Styris: "" Gurkeerat is not MS dhoni""



Gurkeerat: "" Hold my 15(23) Scotty""",8
"commentators should stop talking like we (SRH) already won the match. THe other day, we couldn't chase 119 against KXIP. This is a pitch where Kohli and ABD struggled",3
Just tuned in. Tough wicket to bat on or just crafty bowling from SRH?,2
Srh has become a top tier fielding side that can support the bowlers,4
RCB vs DC is going to be a chokefest,5
"What is the point of Gurkeerat??

Absolutely shit batsman, poor fielder.",4
Gurkeerat . Hats off to you man.,5
siraj is much better. Gurkeerat OMG,3
"One thing mostly on point in SRH matches: Bowler changes and field placements. Probably due to many players with leadership roles in team. Kane, Warner, Rashid, even Holder",8
Jesus Christ run some 2s lads. Kohli please teach these boys about Intent‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,3
CSK played 10 times shittier in the MI match than RCB today but still both teams made the similar score on the same pitch,8
"Although management did a good job this year, they definitely should do something about this middle order thing during next auction, i mean after 4 wickets we are a joke",8
"""Gurkeerat,  you are a marked man""  -- CSK",15
Gurkeerat is the worst player in the ipl. Dubey died for this.,10
C'mon srh chase it down in under 14 overs.,8
Our bowling is incredible and always has been....now hopefully our Batsman just go out and play at Ranji trophy level atleast,8
"so, he rejected the single only to give him the strike next ball?",13
Breaking News: Gurkeerat officially joined Thala academy today. President Dhoni and VP Jadhav were present at the ceremony,11
"Unfortunately, Gurkeerat has run of deliveries to do a Tewatia.",2
My dad just said: who's that mf playing like Dhoni Lmao üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,8
Has gurkeerat ever played a match winning knock? Why is he consistently selected?,6
What is the point of Gurkeerat.,6
"Time for this comment again


DC ü§ù BC ü§ù RCB",8
Kohli looks dejected,5
SRH are gonna cruise if Lord Siraj doesn't strike early,9
Guys tell me when did Gurkeerat play for India?!?!,3
"If next match kohli doesn't bring in dube instead of mann, I am done Supporting RCB.",11
"Dig a hole and bury yourself, fucking useless hack gurkeerat",15
Gurkeerat tried to pull a tewatia. But not all can imitate the Lord,9
r/cricket has a new lord,10
"Bowlers never let down Srh,only the batsmen",14
CANT WAIT TO SEE KOHLI FRUSTRATED,7
Gurkeerat acting like he's chasing 2 runs in last 2 balls,6
Scenes if RCB lose by a run.,5
"Kohli has done well to take an international capped player like Dube, and remove any confidence he might have left.",10
Rcb gurkeerat depression thread,6
Outstanding inning by Chukeerat.,5
Nattu superb beyond anything 4-0-11-1,6
Siraj has a higher strike rate than Gurkeerat,9
retard,5
Koach looks dead inside,5
BoJo's announcement in a little bit is gonna be more exciting than this match,4
r/cricket fail to bring Gurkeerat to form,6
[Almost got the first prediction right](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jlhd8m/-/gap6xz4),1
Run a ball 120 from RCB,4
Why him instead of literally anyone?,7
"I feel so bad for RCB fans it's not even funny, please stop doing this to yourself lads.",9
Nattu has been on fire today.,7
"This pitched outside leg nonsense has no place in cricket. If it's going on to hit the stumps, it should be out.",8
Lmao. Gurukeerat you beauty,4
Gurkeerat ‚ÄúThala‚Äù Singh,6
15(24) just legendary. Fucking loser.,7
"This has to be the worst innings in IPL history?

Edit: I'm talking about Gurkeerat's innings",1
"
""We were short by 20 runs""",6
Man I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre just ending up with 120. I would have atleast excepted 135. This isn‚Äôt even as much as SRH choked on. The f are we going to do with this ?,10
"Can‚Äôt believe this is the same pitch where RR chased down 220+. I fear ourselves in the 2nd innings after that KXIP game, this total is even lower, if we fail to chase this...",7
There is a chance that DC might go to second place if Warner goes mad. Keep your memes handy folks,7
"Run a ball

Warner and Saha to finish this in 13 overs",4
Okay 120. With Saha and Kane hopefully we can do it.,3
time for some braindead bowling by rcb,3
Tharamana sambavam from Gurkreet üëå,8
Good bowling as usual! Gotta get rid of the chase curse!,4
"I don't blame RCB at this point, serves me right for being a masochist",8
"If RCB manage to win this one, no one's stopping them from win the IPL",4
Natarajan you genius,6
"Man, every player shit the bed today, you are blaming Gurki for slow innings.",6
Man of the match Gurkeerat,8
Gurkeerat redemption coming in rcb vs DC,5
"Virgin DC 110 vs Chad RCB 120

we're losing on Monday",7
Well hey atleast Gurkeerat‚Äôs never been dismissed in 2020. Man‚Äôs got an impeccable track record. Should RCB retain him?,5
"Well done boys, great bowling effort, fielding has been great. Great captaincy from Warner as usual.",2
Get Gurkeerat for a post innings interview please..?,3
Wow. Dugout shitting on gurkeerat lol. Poor guy.,9
Awesome bowling Nattu,4
Can RCB somehow win the game?? Or nah,1
120 reached. Better batting than DC,2
Gurkeerat is shittier than shit.,9
Aight who‚Äôs ready for SRHs miserable collapse?,12
I don't like the target,7
Fuck Gurkeerat.,2
Mann‚Äôs 15 off 24 is the worst t20 innings I have seen in a long time!,6
"All the ppl hating on Gurkeerat, sure he could have done 28(24) instead of 15, but him hanging in there was the diff between 90 and 120",4
Scenes when Nattu concedes less than half of the runs Rashid did,4
GURKEERAAATTTTTT - FEELING SAD FOR YOU BRO,1
Dube has potential to be a big hitter and RCB drop him for mediocre player like Gurkeerat instead of giving him confidence,1
"I feel Rcb got no slow bowlers to defend this. Hope the bowling unit turns up. If siraj and morris go over 140kph, might be over for them.",2
NEVER TRUST SRH IN A CHASE.,3
Does Natarajan play in any format for Tamil Nadu team?,3
15(24) NEVER FORGET!!,5
Tbh the only team that can fail to chase this is SRH,5
Gurkeerat Jadhav,3
"So if SRH chase this in 15 overs, only one of RCB or DC can make it through to the playoffs if KXIP win tomorrow right? 

Please lord. Make it happen üò≠",2
is this the worst innings by any batsman after yuvraj singh?,4
"Nattu 4 overs, 11 runs, 1 wicket #nuttin4nattu",4
SRH late resurgence is directly related to the pitches slowing down. Their entire bowling unit is suited to exploit this and they are back to winning games based off their primary strength which is their bowling over the years.,5
"What a fantastic bowler, and a person Natarajan is. Tamizhan da!",4
Feeling somewhat normal now. This is the RCB we knew all these years.,3
"KKR, KXIP, RR have unanimously passed the tender of beating SRH to MI

Atleast PP used to score consistent 30-35.,6
What an innings Gurkeerat take a bow,11
Gurkeerat: Can't hit regular shots. Let me bring out the reverse scoop.,3
 PROBABLY LAST MATCH FOR GURKEERAT IN IPL EVER,5
If i was gurkeerat I would have Hit the wicket after facing the first 15 ballls,3
Short by like 30 runs. But SRH can still choke.,3
"Once kohli is out early, we need to give up on a good score and focus on not shitting the bed like today",4
"After that shitshow against KXIP, I‚Äôm just numb no matter how low the opponent scores.",6
Unpopular opinion right here: Gurkeerat innings was below par.,4
"Jeez Gurkeerat, I feel bad for you now",3
Fun fact gurkeerat has an average of 6.5 in 3 odis,6
"How strange it will be if maximum number of possible teams end up on 14 points & 3 playoff teams are decided by NRR, thus proving once again the genius strats of Dhoni early on /s",5
RCB has been frustrating in the part but this is just another new level of frustrating,3
Super Spy Gurkeerat playing for SRH in RCB jersey. What a legend!,3
"Thankfully, this wasn't the playoffs. Sigh",3
"Can't see how Gurkeerat is better than Dube??? 

RCB fuckall team selection. 

Same level of pathetic team selection that cost us a few games earlier. 

Koach fuck off.",11
Gurkeerat couldn't even get out lmai,7
I need to know what Gurkeerat is in the team for. RCB deserves to lose this and the playoff spot,3
"Gukeerat with a tidy little innings to secure the draw. 



Oh wait, it‚Äôs t20",3
RCB should remove Royal and Challengers both from their names the team ain't royal and Challengers? Challenges thier fans like can you still support us? Fuckkkkkk :(,6
Enough of this disrespect. Don't underestimate our skill to bottle low scoring matches.,6
What happened to Dube?,2
Tricky pitch but 120 is way too low. Unless SRH collapse they will chase this easily.,3
It is understandable RCB have suffered seeing their best batsmen Udana and Morris out so early,7
1-11,2
I remember seeing Gurkeerat in the Indian XI during the Indian tour of Australia in 2016. Nothing to add.,7
Sandeep dropping Gurkeerat is probably the most blatant tactical drop I‚Äôve seen. Benefitted them in the end I‚Äôd say.,4
I hope they don‚Äôt see the low total and start slow,3
Guys scotty said something about kings 11 having the perfect day with MI winning and RCB struggling. So does this mean that kings 11 are hoping that RCB lose?,4
"If rcb manages to win this, will gurkeerat become a hero?",4
"If not for dropped catch by Sandeep and pushing it for four,natarajan probably conceeded just 9 runs",7
"I felt sad for him in a couple of games when he couldn't score, but AB was able to do damage control.

Then couple more where he couldn't score much I thought he was getting into the rythm.

But this is just complete incompetence from Gurkeerat. He needs to be dropped, but don't know if RCB has a viable replacement for him.",9
Great innings for SRH by Gurkeerat,6
"Wait, if we he was trying for a reverse hit, why does it matter that it pitched outside leg? I've seen those given out when batsmen play reverse sweeps against spinners.",5
"""Pitch was slow for stroke making today""",3
What a scrip,2
The hell happened to the top teams except MI? Did they get complacent after reaching the top?,3
I mean these guys are professionals...should be hitting 4s and 6s all day every ball...,2
"Since it's SRH chasing, RCB is still very much in the game.",6
Every team has a Jadhav of their own except Mumbai,6
"Bro please liquidate this franchise if they bow out of the playoffs, I am not even kidding.",5
Go SRH !! Let's not fuck this up.,3
Gurkeerat ‚Äú Kedhar Jadav ‚Äú Singh,8
Gurkeerat Singh Mann snatched strike from Mohammad Siraj just to score 1 run in next 3 balls. IDIOT SHOULD BE KICKED OUT OF THE TEAM!,5
did dhoni meet devilliers or something?,3
"Srh to chase this down in 10 overs so that we know its not that bad of a pitch , just another rcb thing lol",5
RCB is just 60 runs short of winning the match,8
Laughing in SKY,7
"Srh have lost chasing a similar score before , lets see if rcb can do that as well .",5
"Natarajan has be to playing soon for India in T20s. Is very unassuming, gets things done and hey is a left hand pace bowler.",5
SRH should have reviewed the last ball shout for lbw. you never know if that run will make a difference. There was nothing to lose.,7
What's the point just give the trophy to MI already,17
delhi and bangalore back to their original forms?,8
now we'll watch warner and saha bat on a different pitch,9
Formidable total against SRH,11
"How the fuck did Gurkeerat make it into an IPL team, Jesus",4
Who was the imposter ?,8
No way rcb wins this. Right?,4
In before CSK buy Gurkeerat for 7.8 Cr next season :/,11
Did Gurkeerat even hit a boundary in his inning ?,3
"When we let Kedar Jadhav go in 2018, we made sure to get an adequate replacement in Gurkeerat.",11
"""we were 20+20 runs short""",6
So in how many overs should SRH chase this in for RCB's NRR to fall below KXIP's?,7
One of Warner or Williamson needs to play throughout and see the game off. Manish Pandey is inconsistent as fuck. Rest of the middle order is inexperienced,7
They should have picked Natarajan for T20Is against Australia,8
Please SRH don't bottle this üôè,7
RCB have a mercurial lower middle order hence why Gurkeerat had to play anchor. I am now starting to hate the word anchor,6
Sandeep finally got that knuckleball down.,8
This is funny.,5
Sandeep Sharma is GOOD. I mean GOOOOOOD.,3
"Gurkeerat, this piece of shit batted for 24 balls, hits just one boundary, and that too off the edge. This guy can't even swing bat properly. Don't know who the replacement would be, but this guy is just not on.",7
"Really hope RCB don't drop Philippe. He's not the issue. Yes he can be better against spin, but worth keeping him in. But please drop Gurkeerat. Until now, he didn't do anything of harm, but now he literally has lost us a match. Please drop him.",11
We need the annual ritual post of how RCB can make the playoff. That will bring a sense of normalcy to 2020. Please someone do it1,7
RCB fans hoping not to get to the playoffs to protect our health and the inevitable disappointment??,5
Now see SRH score 65-0 in 5 overs and prove that there was nothing much wrong with the pitch.,14
does anyone really think dube would've played better than gurkeerat. he's not really a timer of the ball and on this pitch probably would have played a similar innings to morris and udana. and i say this as someone who strongly dislikes gurkeerat's game.,3
"For fucks sake, pick anybody, another bowler, someone from the support staff or something instead of this useless hack gurkeerat",9
People here are talking about match finishing in 15 overs. Don't forget the same SRH side folded for 114. Get Warner Early and panic ensues.,2
To be chased in 14-15 overs,5
Tuk Tuk Kohli > Intent Kohli,11
There IS  DEW.,5
21 runs and 3 wickets in the death. This has to be one of the best death bowling ever,4
Watch SRH skyrocket their NRR chasing this down in 13.,5
This was a 160 pitch. This will be easily chased down.,6
Johnny knows a lot about in swingers,2
"Gurukeerat, what's the point of staying not out in all the games ffs!",1
RCB PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS 120? EVEN 130/135 I WILL UNDERSTAND DA WHAT CAN WE DO WITH BLOODY 120?,4

SRH gonna finish this in 14 overs,0
Lol Sandeep‚Äôs like ‚Äúball‚Äôs coming on nicely on the bat‚Äù,5
Either RCB should win or SRH should win in 16th over to screw up RCB's run rate and give a better chance to KXIP. DC's run rate is already lesser than KXIP so if RCB's goes lower too then KXIP would only need to win against CSK and not worry about run rate.,7
I just hope Manish anna learnt his lesson from the Punjab match.,7

Gurkeerat has milked his tattoo quota enough. He's getting the boot next match.,1
Bottom teams are showing full intent and zeal to qualify. While top team looks like feeling way to comfortable after reaching 14 points.

Keeps picking Siraj no matter what (okay in one game he did well, all other games piss poor). 

Picking clueless looking Gurkeerat over promising six hitter Dube.",8
"So here's what is going to happen.  

Sundar and Chahal are going to be decent, but Siraj will go for a few runs and so will Saini, unable to limit their pace on this pitch. By this time the batsmen are set and take 1s and 2s and keep the scoreboard moving and targetting the occasional over till the score is about 23 to win off 36.   

Then Saini comes and bowls a 4 run over and gets a wicket, but Siraj, still bowling test lengths, goes for 14.",6

RCB and DC looks like identical with Virat and ABD at 3-4 in RCB and Iyer and pant at the same position. If they fail their whole batting line up collapse.

"**1.2** Washington Sundar to Warner, OUT, Warner looks to dominate him after the first-ball six, but chooses the wrong length now. Sundar is a little fuller than the last ball, Warner is looking to clear midwicket but ends up going straight to mid-on **10-1**

Just as I feared,4
"I hate watching Siraj bowl, but damn that dude always looks positive to be around",6
Pandey knows his loyalties lies with Karnataka and not srh,3
why you always gotta make an interesting match out of low targets?,6
RCB have a foot in the door. This chase is right up Williamson's alley though. He lives for these odd-ish scores.,6

Oh god don't repeat that,3

you're chasing 121, already hit a 6 and your NRR is the second best in the table after MI.",5
Oh Sundar you Sundar!,3
Pandey's gonna be gone soon lol,2
Game's over folks,2
SRH gifted their important wicket,3
"Basically for RR fans, 13.5 over win by SRH here. 

If that happens, a fairly big win by RR will be enough to qualify if either KXIP or SRH lose their last game. DC vs RCB doesn't matter if RR beat KKR hard enough.",5
is the ball swinging ? apart from that one  KKR game siraj never got the new ball,4
Washi for captain,6

The only time in the history of the sport itself that I root for Warner to do well he goes out cheaply... It's just one of those days. I need to stop supporting teams/people now,9
"There's only 2 gears on Pandey.

don't do that. don't give me hope.,2
Saini is a bit brain dead too yeah?,5
It should have been udana! Saini‚Äôs pace not suitable.,1
Either Pandey plays really well or really shitty. No middle ground.,2
Morris and Saini where the ever loving FUCK is Siraj man fucking hell even Mr. Nags would've thought of that,6

Still no Siraj. Great,9
Omg guys we're fucked,4
"Wth

Why Saini over Siraj?",9

"Pace off Saini, pace off !!",8
"KXIP loss flashbacks for SRH fans, at least we got good score in powerplay in that game",3
again two keepers batting,3
When is the lord coming,6
Yay go manish,2
Some guys are damn too negative. Surely SRH is gonna chase down 121.,6
Change the pace you fucking idiot fuck Saini motherfucker,7
"Alright, time to turn this chase of 120 into 160.",7
 Pandey is a part time keeper right,4
"Come on Manish, redemption for the Punjab innings and the exact same chase",4
Every other team has been supporting us for the last few games but no one wants to join us at the bottom of the table :(,7
Manish Pandey is like AK Hangal. You know he will be bullied when he comes on. And you know he will perish.,3
"Retarded captaincy

Great shot Saha!! Now that we got the boundary let's just take singles,4

So they shud keep their intensity up continiously with the bat. Dont repeat the mistake like in last game where they were batting like chasing 127 n batted with just the required RR n choked at last. Try to finish early.",4
These guys are showing more intent than I saw in whole DC innings earlier.,4
Siraj was good with the new ball why not give it to him?,7
Why tf are we rushing,3

"With kohli in the field, you hear him more than the commentators at time. UNREAL energy he yar bhai.",6
Cant believe Saini is gonna let Manish hit boundaries easily,7
saini really isn't a thinking bowler at all,7
Yet again Siraj doesn't bowl with the new ball. Can't wait for RCB's fast bowlers to bowl full pace on a slow pitch and get hammered,11
Didn't Manish Pandey hit a 100 for rcb once upon a time. Or maybe I've just hallucinated,6
PACE OFF JESUSSSS FUCKING DENSE ASSHOLES,12
Dumb motherfucker,7
Pandey's selection over SKY in T20 for Australia must be one the greatest mysteries of 2020. Of course Rohit's non selection takes first place.,2
"Irrespective of the results, we should be happy that there are so many talented youngsters giving these old geezers a tough fight. The future is bright for Indian cricket.",6
I waited all day for this game. I feel so shit.,6
Whatta shot,1
No need to play shots. Just rotate strike and get a boundary every now and then... I don't want a repeat of KXIP,5
"SRH probably reckons pitch will get slower and harder so they want to attack early.

Fair enough I would say!",3
Chalo good night bye bye congrats SRH gg!,8
"Historically, Pandey becomes twice the batsman at this time of tournament.",7
That's RR match Pandey! We just need a Shankar on the other side and we can pull it off boys!,4
Why would you give the ball to Saini? The pitch is slow and Saini provides extra pace and bounce to work with,8
Warner's wicket was so important today. He should have curbed his instincts and played his accumulator/finisher role.,3
Is it time for Pandey redemption arc?,1
legit all we need to do is 1 four and 2 singles and over,3
I knew it. I knew they would hit more sixes in the powerplay than we did in the whole match,11
"Saini is massively overrated.

Fight me.",7

"Not bowling their best pace bowler in the first 3 overs, with the new ball ...

Really tells you how shit of a captain Virat really is.",11
"Fuck it, bowl slow",22
1/6 of the runs done lmao,14
Does RCB not have a bowling coach to tell these idiots about bowling strategy that suits the pitch??,8
Saini really shouldn't have been bowling now. Would have been perfect for Siraj.,11
KOHLI IS THE BIGGEST UNLUCKY CURSED CAPTAIN THIS FELLOW WONT WIN ANYTHING FOR INDIA AS WELL MARK MY WORDS.,5
Pandey swinging like a mad man at everything man.,4
Why isn't siraj bowling? Isn't he the factor with good lengths early on?,8
"Cometh the hour

Cometh the lord pleaseeeeeeeeee ffs Kohli, dont even care if he gets thrased",12
Alright nibbas pandey in form this game is done,6
Is there any ground in the world where the par score is below 300 (for ODIs)?,2

Do RCB have a possibility of getting knocked out ?,7
Imagine if we had won that punjab match üò≠,18
Thank you RCB for pulling me out of DC depression,20

I'd rather listen to a Stephen king audio book recorded by Kp + sunju than listen to 10min of Anjum,4
Koach threw that ball like he was bout to murder someone with it,10
No foreign player should be allowed to join the srh team further since they'll never get picked,3
"manish pandey is two face, heads for awesome innings tails fr working for opponent team",8
what's the point of having Siraj if you are not gonna give him the ball in the first few overs,7
Karnataka boys always play well against RCB!,8
"Saini lucky to not concede 20 last over. 

Looks like he's the latest addition to the ""Hey look. I can bowl 140 clicks but I'm braindead"" gang.",5
SRH got to ensure they keep rotating the strike,5
kohli's captaincy makes no sense. why not siraj to open and get some swing,9
You got what you wanted from washington with getting warner. Now get your best bowlers to get wickets,3
"Fucking Kohli doesn't bowl Siraj during new ball swing time, how he is still captain is beyond me",9
"Pandey ji I like this intent

No fear when Kanos is here",3
Philippe is a good fielder for a kid that kicked up a stink and left the scorchers because they couldn't guarantee him the keeping spot.,5
"I just realized it isn't ""unacademy cracking six"" but ""unacademy let's crack it six"". The commentators misled us all this time.",9
The saddest part of today is that if SRH win the MoM will go to a batsman instead of a bowler. The MI/DC MoM should have gone to Bumrah,18
"Pandey: let me do tuk tuk

Pandey the very next match: I'm gonna swing at everything

Pandey the match after that: tuk tuk

Literally nothing in between",12
Lol did Kohli not see the swing Sandeep and Holder were getting. Why would you not bowl Siraj,33

*Cries in Bairstow*,8
Lmao this is what happens when you don't use Siraj early,17
What is Kohli doing? You have to bowl Siraj early. He is good with a new ball and not so good with an old ball.,11
"GGWP RCB.
That string of wins at start made me watch the IPL which I never cared about.",13
Saha plays sweep really well.,8
"Manish Pandey: Full intent, BC",8
Beautiful shot,3
Making ABD bat at 6...not opening with Siraj after he performed wonderfully with the new ball....giving the 18th over to Siraj in a crucial juncture and leaking runs...no wonder Team India hasn't won anything significant under Kohli.,14
SRH batters just need to stay in and keep the scoreboard ticking ..,1

Calculater Time for RCB,4
Saha is a better keeper and has been in better batting form then pant. But watch the management play pant in tests because of how he performed 1 year ago in Australia,4
This might be the only day I'd be ok with a test match innings from Pandey,8
"Ok. Time for that comment: 

Josh Philippe: ""Look at me! I'm Steve Smith.""",4
The more Saha scores runs the more he puts pressure on Pant before Adelaide test. We know how easily Virat changes team in Test.,5
One of many questions that has puzzled people in 2020: What is the role of Siraj in the team?,10
"Unless it rains which it never does, RCB NRR shit does not matter from a Delhi perspective as long as they lose.",5
Memory : MI defends a sub 120 score against RPS in 2017 to go on win the IPL,10
Can you imagine if RCB lose their next match whilst getting thrashed in this one (negatively affecting their NRR).. and KXIP win tomorrow against CSK lmao.. absolutely scenes of RCB miss out and KXIP make it.,12
"Why isn't Phillipe keeping, he's a WK right?",8
"Saha sweeping like a master in the last two matches makes me worry about Kohli, Rohit and KL. All 3 of them looked really uncomfortable against spin in this IPL. More than the pace trio of Australia, I am worried about the GOAT in the upcoming series down under.",16

"FFS Virat, bowl Udana. Take the pace off. Learn from your last match mistakes.",7
No point giving siraj bowling now.. The ball is not going to swing. Sundar should be used for 4th and 6th overs and not 2nd and 4th..,5
"Damn, I thought Govinda would make the cut.",1
"I like this frm SRH

Everyone shud learn how to chase frm yesterday's game. How RR never let the intensity down even tho run rate was under control. SRH doing the same here.",5
I want to see a  SKY type of gesture from Manish Pandey at the end of the game,5
RCB could've played another spinner,4

Siraj is going for 30+ runs today in his first two overs.,5
Isn't Siraj at his best when he's able to swing the ball at the start? Why hasn't he been used yet?,5
Dw SRH there's no way Kane bottles this,8

Why am I still watching this,1

This is the Morris everyone knows.,3
I just saw Kohli call Chahal Ben Stokes.,11

Morris just wants to give us a boundary off the legs,3

"What was the plan here?? He kept bowling at the legs, bowled wides, kept at it, concedes a 4 , surprised Pikachu face.",6
Thing with Virat's tantrums is as long as he keeps scoring runs you can defend him but when he doesn't score himself he just looks silly.,13
What a terrible over. Absolutely awful.,11
Kohli could cut his antics and focus on being a better captain,1
Looking at the scorecard wtf was mann doing,4
Well we need our calculator back. Csk return it now,3
ohhh the dew!!!!,2
This is so bad from Morris. He was firing so well which was THE big reason RCB had that winning run. Form is a fickle thing.,3
This over is lengthy af,2

"Kohli, you are such a shitty cApTaIn, especially for rcb.",2
This game conclusively shows that Virat Kohli is a terrible captain and needs to be replaced immediately with Namma Vinay Kumar.,9
i want rcb to release siraj and i want him to come back and rip through our batting order,8
What a controlled pull shot!,3
I think we should drop Kholi in the next auction. 17 crore is a lot for this performance,8
Kohli playing the delay and break the flow game?,1
Siraj and his bouncers. Complete shitshow,3
SUPPORTING RCB GIVES YOU MENTAL TRAUMA,9
I love how RCbians hope big things for Siraj. He is not a superman and can't do shit if his batsmen did not give any total to defend.,7

Those KXIP player celebrating scenes gave me PTSD...,5
Doesn't bowl siraj with the new ball. Absolutely small brain.,4

Ok. So everyone can see that pace off is the way on this pitch so naturally rcb bowl siraj and Morris. Makes perfect sense,4
My man has my triple test centuries as a number 7. Ik it‚Äôs not the same but it just goes to show how UNDERRATED he is as a batsman,9
So the reason why SRH did not win all time was due to playing Bairstow which effected the team balance.,10
I love how Murali is looking for the bowl without moving an inch,8
if rcb manages to drop out of top 4 then 2020 will return to normal,13
I will never understand Kohli as a captain,9
What will rcbs nrr be after this match? Below kxip?,1
We're fuelled by RCBs fanboy's salt right now,1
"Please SRH chase this total down in 15 overs..... with love, from a KXIP fan.",2
DD vs RCB. Stoppable Force meets Movable Object,9
I hope MI rest some key players for the final game against us.,5
RCB fans are in a familiar territory now.,7
"Imagine if RCB as we know it never happened in Kohli's life. Imagine how much better batsman and a positive cricketer he might be. The fans joke about their fate being RCB fans, imagine playing and leading such a team

 (I know he is partly responsible for RCB's fate but still...)",7
**Umpire looks like indian DAD ordering his kids to stop the TV and go to bed**,2
How they are getting the ball immediately after it went out of the park,1
The only time Siraj produced a performance of note ever was when he opened the bowling vs kkr. Why wouldn't rcb give him the new ball?,6

Friendship ended with RCB. MI is my new friend,6
"I really find it funny that Mumbai fans think they have some truly overpowered team when in reality, the rest of the teams are just shit.

But whatever floats your boat man!",1
Where are all the Siraj fanboys?,6
Why are they displaying DL par score on the screen?,2
[deleted],10
Lol half way done within the powerplay,5
I am pretty sure Kohli thinks he's a great captain,14
Honestly who is more pathetic between DC and RCB. Let's watch on Monday to find out.,7
"Considering DC and RCB are handing over #2 spot to each other, I won't be surprised if there's multiple super overs on Monday",7
Any chance MI will not qualify now?,1
"Yeah it looks like Bangalore are losing momentum towards the back end very much like Dehli. Hyderabad however have found their balance at the right time, and if they continue they should make the playoffs. Saha opening and keeping instead of YJB as well as Holder in the middle has made a difference. Nice of them to be on the way to winning after I bet virtual money on them.",6
"Few days ago, the Supreme Court ordered the winding up of United Breweries, which owns the RCB franchise. I hope that the team is disbanded too, for my mental health's sake",10
Koacb worst captain? Yes or yes?,13
Hate to say ..Delhi and Rcb are called chokers for a good reason..,16
everything about rcb is braindead. why are we bowling short and fast,10
How bad does RCB need to lose for its NRR to fall below DC's?,6
Morris has shown why he moves from franchise to franchise every season,7
"Why doesn't Siraj bowl that good length to full length channel always? He gets bashed when he goes short. The pitch isn't as fast as he thinks it is. 

And I thought Kohli is some wizard who injects some elixir into fast bowlers to make them world beating instantly? What's going on?",5
Whip out the calculators lads,7
May be we peaked at the right time? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,5

I don‚Äôt mind if they remove him if he doesn‚Äôt perform but I feel like saha should be in atleast the first and second test.,3
"There he is, Zubaan Kesari!",9
"I'm already thinking about next match. 

RCB vs DC 

Best thing about that match is, at least one of them is going to win. Finally. 
Otherwise I don't have any hope from these two.

Royale chokers bangalore VS Delhi Chokers.",17
Umpire's like we can't risk having this match end before 9thover without the Time-out,5
LIC ad is so cringy,6
"SRH were staring down the Barrell, demoralizing loss to Kings XI and having to make the climb against the top 3 teams.

They decimated DC and controlling things against RCB. Batting first and second. Ace example of them actually taking the cliche talking point, taking the positives and coming back stronger. Giving Saha the go ahead to let loose and keeping Williamson as a sureshot insurance policy.

Saha delivers and they've got back up and the bowling is sharp with Rashid being at his absolute best.

Big ups.",12
Kohli is a God like batsman but a shit captain with horrible tactics.,15
"What is SRH chase in 12 overs. 

Rcbs net run rate below DC?",6
"Ok SRH fans, we had a similar powerplay against KXIP. These two should play another 4 overs for 25 runs for us to relax.",6
Why is that dude advertising while showering,7
Just be challenging to come up with a jingle for life insurance without it being morbid.,2
LIC jingle pretty good!,2
Who scored slowly in rcb?,2
Chahal comes in and the target is half made,5
Is chutiya team ko hataao tournament se,16
"Can RCB fans cause some online rage to get kohli removed from captaincy?

You have the power to get this change.",5
We suck. If we do make playoffs we're going to get embarrassed,9

Now this looks like Sharjah,5
All we need is KXIP winning with a fair margin and SRH winning against MI to knock off the loser of DC-RCB. Wild to consider it a couple of weeks back but here we are.,5
So Chahal won‚Äôt bowl in power play even if the match is over before that.,3
This is the phase they have to be careful. Just don't attack Chahal. Get 4 to 5 off his over,3
Wait what did Kohli do? I'm just switching on.,4
"As per my weakass calculations, if SRH chases the target in 14.4 overs, and then KXIP and SRH both win their next matches, they both qualify and RCB vs DC becomes the decider",8
This happened to Bairstow in the England set-up. Eased out of the keeper spot by Buttler and then not considered good enough to be played as a pure batter. It's why he frowns a lot!!,9
Dew and Kane between SRH collapse and RCB win,3
That loss against CSK is/will really hurting/hurt RCB considering they are playing DC next.,6
Morris has been the bowling MVP for Bangalore this season. One bad match and RCB fans are shitting on him.,8

"These bowling changes, bowling plans, and field placements are just poor strategy. RCB had just had a good little period with Washy outsmarting Warner; all they needed was to keep applying the pressure.

But they go ahead and bowl fastest bowlers in the team on a slow pitch and bowl short on a ground with smallest square boundaries. Now actual strike options like Chahal and Udana have no wriggle room. Captaincy is poor and strategy is worse.

"Been thinking for a few years that the cursed influence of Mallya is the reason for this team never doing well. Change the name to something else, maybe that will work.

Because obvious things like changing the captain will never be done by Bangalore.",10
how rcb even have fans left after all these years baffles me sometimes man :(. We are like the pokemon audience waiting and waiting for him to win a championship. Even ash won a championship recently but our wait continues,12
Who will koach sledge today?,3
"FFS, slow pitch. Let's pack the team with 3 140+ bowlers who do not have a knuckle ball, slow ball or any variation. What brainless captaincy and at the toss, he stated he wanted to bat first. How idiotic is this? SRH without Marsh, bhuvi, vijay and still playing like this is unbelievable.",18
Pandey these days is high on something,3
"61 required of 78, who's taking bets that SRH chokes here",7
Rcb not bowling slower balls.. Srh going for biggies when req run rate is less than 6.. Do they do these cunting deliberate? Like Wtff! They are international players!,3
Another sub 15 over match for the weekend incoming...,1
DC and RCB losing their way near the day end of the tournament?,2
Get the fucking sunny g out of commentary,1
Fuck! Kohli started sledging again.,4
Chahal could take two more and it wouldn't matter,5
Guess it's going to the 14 th over after all.,2
How did two kids afford a phone.,3
What did virat shout?,2
Under what circumstances will RCB and DC both not qualify?,3
Somehow the batting makes it seem like we are chasing 200,5
[deleted],1
This is last recognised pair.... As I said they will make this score look like 190...,2
"Y'all be shitting on RCB's bowling, but really you shouldn't be expecting much defending 120 ish. Gurkeerat was the issue today.",6
Can someone pls tell me the prayer that Nita Ambani was chanting? I really want Rcb to win,6
"""Nothing to lose lads..come on!!"" -Kohli

Umm I beg to differ",7
Imagine if gurkeerat smashed into Morris,1
Lol most of the Indian T20 batting squad for AUS is either injured or out of form.,2
I think Kane's gonna win us the match,1
Snickers ad featuring Dhoni is cringe.,2
"Year 4040: 

Dhoni is still playing

No covid vaccine yet

RCB still shit",15
I have a feeling this might get down the wire or SRH collapse like earlier.,1
[deleted],6
Someone should give MSD Snickers on the field next time he tries to get umpire to change the decision out of anger.,4
"First half of the tournament teams cant chase, 2nd half of the tournament teams cant defend.",4
Geez just how good is Chahal,4
Only 60 runs left and 4 decent batsmen left,1
"Obviously Pandey was playing for the NRR, he was hitting everything from ball one. Stop the rant.",3
Koach admitting we got nothing to lose is hilarious,8
Aye 50th match of kanos,2
[removed],20
Nothing to lose lol Koach you have not qualified yet.,5
giroooouuudd,1
Why are srh fans panicking with just 2 wickets down please trust your team man,6
"Get Kanos out

Then trigger collapse.exe",9
"Ipl 2020 playoffs. MI, DC, Kings and SRH.",3
I hope dew factor reduces in the coming matches. Playoffs will not be fun if it becomes a win toss bowl first and win match sort of matches.,10
Whats up with these leg lines mfers?,4
So RCB vs DC is going to be a knockout. This season just got a lot spicier!,11
Please don't lose these 2 easy points SRH,6
KOHLI PLEASE LEAVE RCB IM DONE WITH YOU.,11
Awww Today is Kane's 50th IPL game. Remember when haters said it's not Test it's T20 why would you buy him?,8
If they collapse they are out,7
Vrat makes me like and value Kane a lot more,7
As much as I hate mi they're the only ones who deserve to win the tournament,26
"Take Kohli's mask off....its Dhoni saying ""nothing to lose""",10
"Smart play from Saha & Kane, shows how stupid of a player Manish is, and we pick him above Sky",2
Swann fuck off. We've got the best NRR by far and there's just one game left for everyone. Nobody is overtaking us unless they win by 200 runs or something,18
"feel dube's medium pace would've done well today

and not to mention he couldn't have possibly batted worse than gurkeerat",7
Wtf Udana. Stop bowling at the legs,3
If SRH win here I would like RCB to beat DC. Koach is a legend who deserves to win IPL once. DC have a young core so they have time.,2
lmao CSK at the top of the fair play. Typical,12
Isuru is a cute name. Sounds nice,10
Am I the only one who Is seeing so many Dhoni ads of late?,5
Wadda fook? CSK took our spot at the top of fair play. Damn you CSk,7
Kane and his test Innings,3
"For lads from UK, 4 week lockdown coming up.

Stay safe, fellas.",8
It's amazing how the winner of RCB vs DC will go to top 2 and the loser might end up getting knocked out of the play-offs all together.,6
"Aight guys we are atleast winning the fair play awardü•∞ü•∞
I dont even know whyüòÇüòÇ",6
Swann going on arguing when he doesn't have a point.,3
SRH has to get one of Kishan or SKY in the next mega auction. Kishan is still more of an opener so SKY it is,4
"Udana just keep it tight, chahal will get the wickets.",9
Giroud in for chelsea at the same time too lol.,1
"All things considered, bowlers for RCB haven‚Äôt been too bad. Can‚Äôt constantly give them sub 150 scores to defend",5
"No one cares about the fair play awards, why they keep showing it",3
"Is anyone old enough to remember the discussions where people said that t20s will lead to the end of spinners and their skillset !

Sounds so funny in retrospect but shows how much our thinking about the game has evolved",4
Manish fucked up another good start? So typical,1
RCB shitting the race and dropping out of top 4 will be the biggest choke in IPL,4
"""We have nothing to lose""

Bruh what about the fuckin tournament",11
"Who gives two fucks about the fair play award, why do they keep showing it to us? They might just as well show us the flight arrival/departures board from a random airport.",7
slower balls work? who would've thought,2
How do they quantify fair play?,1
I simply don't understand how CSK winning fairplay with Dhoni bullying umpires...,6
Damn it's almost as if not bowling express pace aimlessly helps,3
Might as well start bowling underarm. The only way to win it.,2
"Udana, Chahal and Sundar all eyes on you.

No point in giving bowl to Saini, Siraj and Morris as they are not able to bowl slower ones.",3
Fuck that kane..,3
Fuck Williamson,2
Gone?,1
Out,3
"As an RCB fan, I want to know how it feels to not need a calculator. Anyone?",3
LMAOOOOO,3
"Udana is such an intelligent bowler. 

Can't believe koach dropped him for his wicked permutation combination experiments.",6
Lol here comes the collapse. This is big standard cricket from SRH.,3
lmao no way,2
"Damn, I think Chahal got him..",2
What,2
Someone call a Williamson run out,2
Who here called a run out lol,1
you gotta be kidding me,1
no not kane,1
oh shit,1
"Any Srilankan fan here?
Please tell me guys is he really worth the 4th foreigner spot?",1
Even in 1st match Umesh got Warner out in similar fashion,2
Scenes if they show snicko for the hand touch,3
Chahal's agility on the field is actually underrated,4
Oh fuck me,2
worst way to get out for kane :(,3
ffs,1
"F**k you @RCB mgmt and ImVkohli...you guys have screwed your fans over for nearly a decade now. I hope you crash out and a more deserving team like KXIP or RR makes it. At least they'll have the cojones to take on MI. I've said this before and I'll say it again, if RCB and IND are serious about some wins in competitions that aren't bullshit bilateral series, change the effing leadership. Kohli the batsman and Kohli the captain are two different animals and you know it. #rcbpaintrain

PS - @DC...screw you too.",4
That's exactly the kind of luck RCB needed.,4
Rolleeeee rolleeee rolleeeee,3
Tell me he is safe plsssüòîüòî,2
"Udana ER is 4. Morris, Saini and Siraj are 10+. Even at 120, rcb had a fighting chance. By not bowling udana earlier, opportunity squandered. Thanks to Koach the great!",2
[deleted],1
Srh gonna choke lmaooo,-2
Honestly I can't say if he's touched that.,1
Ultraedge on the fingers,3
Check whether he is inside first,3
"i wanna cry, dube was needed",1
He's in,1
Swanny you blind pos.,6
Did it touch the hand? Can't say conclusively,2
no contact,2
SRH WINS THIS 100%,1
"Reaction of Sundar is hilarious. He was like, "" yeah, he touched it, I saw it"" from gully cricket.",2
Shades of Mark Wood in the World Cup .,1
"RCB v DC knockout

 


MI v SRH one-sided knockout


 

KXIP v CSK one-sided knockout

 

RR v KKR knockout+depend on other results.",3
Chahals stuck with all the luck of rcb,2
I don't think it touched his fingers,2
We need ultra edge,1
Shouldn't you check whether he is in the crease or not first,9
Ultraedge on finger ball touching,3
he ded,1
Uff! He is in,3
Check if he made it at least you stupid fucks!,6
I have a deja vu srh gonna win it,1
"Check if he‚Äôs in crease first, if he is then no need to waste time",8
Williamson looks in tho,6
Hand of God IPL edition,2
no contact.,2
see ashwin this is how you mankad someone,5
It didn‚Äôt touch,1
Damn that level of zoom,1
I don't know man. looks like it didn't touch. can't conclude?!,1
Don‚Äôt think he touched it,1
Chahal is cheating,1
No touch,3
He touched it but he got back,2
E N H A N C E ONE MORE TIME!,2
swann would make the worst third umpire,1
He has touched it. There's a deflection.,2
Slightly touching,1
No contact,1
Srh please win this,1
Gonna support RR from next season.,2
Won't be given out. Not conclusive,2
Fucking cheats.,2
Yo check the bat it's in probably,1
Chodu 3rd umpire first look whether Williamson was in or not,5
By the barest of margins,2
Darn cheat,2
IT FUCKING HIT,3
WTF is umpire smoking. Lol.,3
Very tough,2
Same shit again. This happened in the previous RCB game too for us.,2
Third umpire looks drunk af,4
"from next time, check if batsman is in to save time kek.",3
Swan jizzing to chahals fingers,2
"I think he touched it, doesn't look like the kinda guy who appeals that loud if it didnt",4
"He touched it, see the deviation",4
Funny if he's in after all this. Moronic to check this way round,8
Lmao check whether Kanos is in or not before rock and rolling,3
Bro it touched,2
"His finger is bending backwards, definitely touched.",3
BRUHHHH YAAAAYYYY,2
no side by side?,2
Who was the dumbass asking to use snicko?,3
Warner in the reverse fixture and Williamson now. Luck hasn't been on our side at all this year.,3
Chahal gonna cost fair play points,2
Looked like he was in,2
Come on at least show the side view!!,3
Chahal fingered the ball. But I feel Kane made it.,7
Is the umpire jacking of by seeing the ball?,3
Noooooo :(,1
Stop arguing ffs,2
DRAMA,3
What the heck is this umpiring.,1
Was there a soft signal?,6
Kohli expression will be pricessless when the not out is shown on the screen,2
Tf is wrong with kohli decision has been given,3
Poor zampa running drinks,2
Bat is probably in anyway,3
Did he finger it?,5
IPL need Thermal IR tech,5
Koach BC chup. Go and field,0
Kano looked like he made it anyways,3
Show if he‚Äôs in or not ffs,6
Benefit of the doubt to the batsman rule.,3
Kohli being Kohli...,3
LOL cant wait to see Kohli rage,4
Stay in crease ya cunts!,2
Is there no Snicko for that?,0
"It definitely touched but Kane was inside the crease  
Edit: I called it haha",3
Tbh it looked like his finger kissed the ball,4
"Third ump can scuk his own willy, if he has one.",3
Was Williamson in or out,1
Chahal must be heartbroken. He was so confident,2
Not conclusive enough. Not out in my opinion,3
Uff thank god,1
This proves Chahal and Koach ain't no MSD!,5
"Didn't touch it, but seriously how do they not have a top down view?",3
"Cameraman finding cuties, definitely a tharki chokro",3
"Virat "" The BCCI"" Kohli on it",0
I don't want to sound biased but this was clearly touching and Chahal ain't a guy who will lie like this,3
Kohli staging a protest there?,4
"Koach arguing, what do you think you are, Thala?",4
maybe the slightest of touch. can't blame the third umpire i guess,3
VK and Chahal negotiating at Sabji Mandi,4
Fuckers are going to steal our last position in fair play which is Delhi‚Äôs birth right!!,8
Need back angle to see this. From the front def didnt look conclusive,1
"Thank God it wasn't Dhoni, else sub would have become extremely toxic.",2
Wtf shithousery review this decision again,2
There‚Äôs no way Chahal would‚Äôve appealed so hard. He definitely got a hand on it :(,4
Absolutely rigged- see the deviation,0
This scene in movies : ZOOM AND ENHANCE,2
"Forget whether he touched it or not for a moment, was Kane in or out?",2
I like that this umpire has taken his time to make the decision.,2
Clowns umpiring. Remember the DC vs KXIP match?,1
Blind umpires,1
Looks Kane already kept the bat inside anyway,3
"He was in anyway, lmao",4
"Wtf koach asshole wanna argue, does he also want ravi shastri to be third umpire",3
Okay nice stfu it's over now,2
loool was not out anyways,4
lol easily in. Waste of time.,4
It touched..... can‚Äôt really blame Kohli for being mad,2
Idiotic third umpire,3
Damn they got Warner last time and almost got Kanos this time,2
It was not out anyway lmao,4
Was he in?,3
He is in..,2
Not out anyway lol,3
"Lol. 

He was in. 

Cool down Kohli",6
It was a waste of time. Kane was in.,3
Doesn't matter. Williamson made it,3
he was in anyway u idiots,5
"Yeah fuckers , who was saying shit umpiring ????",5
"Which ""slight deviation"" has Anjum seen? And he was in anyway.",4
It was not out anyway,3
Bat was inside anyway,3
Kohli and Chahal reprimanded for Breach of Conduct,6
"Fuck this slow mo. 


Just ask the feilder like ponting did.",8
He was in lol,7
I think it touched but I feel Williamson was also safe,5
Oh baby.. just roll it one more time,2
Show the side Angle ffs. Was he in regardless?,6
WOW,1
lmao kane was already in,1
Bruh üòÇ,1
Lol it's not out anyways.,2
balls on the umpire to upset kohli,2
Lmao,1
He's not out already lol,1
The replay everyone needed,3
Less go Williamson,1
Lol,1
Who was that cutie? üòè,3
Clown umpiring,6
Omg what a stupid umpire!,2
Two fundamental tendencies are now coming into play - RCB inherent memeness vs an epic SRH collapse.,4
"All rrollleee wasted, he was in anyway",6
He was in. Pointless debate,1
batriarchy in display there lol but Kane was back,2
Lmao not out anyway. Should have checked bat's landing first,2
Waste of time,2
What a waste of time that was,4
Kane is clearly in. What is the argument about?,4
"He was in anyways, so it didn't matter at the end.",1
Kohli should be banned for rest of the tournament for this.,-2
"He was in anyways, so pointless üòÇ",2
"Well, it's not out anyway.",1
"Stupid 3rd ump, should've first checked in kanos bat is in crease instead of rock and rolling 100 times",8
Lol.he is in anyway. So much drama for nothing.,2
"Should've checked if he got in or not first, would've saved all this drama.",5
Why didn't they just check the run-out first,3
"Lmao all time deciding whether he touched or not, just to find out batsman was already in",8
The umpire slowed it down so much that he couldn‚Äôt decide. First replay showed a deflection,2
whats happening damn power cut,1
"Side Angle says he was in anyway, if anyone is curious.",4
Lol this is time waste,6
"Thanks for showing kanos was already in, couldn't stand woke people on insta and twitter making rainbow charts asking ""out or not out""",11
"Dint touch, so stfu now",1
Lamao he reached the crease lamao,1
"Kane was in lmao

Hope Kohli sees it and gets calm down lol",6
LOL THAT TOOK FOREVER,2
"If RCB release kohli or AB they can buy legit better bowlers, kohli and AB have exorbitant retention fees",1
Oh he wasn't out anyways. Calm down lads,3
"He was in, this is brain dead umpiring",3
Zampa holding those drinks like its a baby in a towel,11
They should have checked if he crossed the line first .. wasted everyone's 5 minutes.. shit umpiring,6
It would've been not out anyways. Wtf was he doing checking the fingers without checking if he made it to the crease.,9
I hope fatherhood changes Kohli.. Can't go around throwing tantrums like a 10yr old,11
This is one of most moronic things I saw today and I saw the whole Delhi batting innings.,35
Anjum Chopra is trash. Made a fool of herself,7
"Ok why didn't they show that side-on first, to show that the batsman was fucking **IN**. What an utter waste of time.",3
Wtf is anjum Chopra going on about. How can she confidently say chahal touched the ball,5
"Such chutiya umpiring, First should check if he's in or not",0
I could literally see the ball changing its course once it crossed by Yuzi's fingers.,2
"For people cursing the umpire. 
1. It's a rule to look at events in chronological order. 
2. It wasn't conclusive enough to overturn the on field umpire 's decision.",13
Kane made it..ffs should've shown if he was in the crease first.,4
Shmshuddin is a Hyderbadi. This is a disaster lol.,5
"Should have started with that part. I believe Chahal touched it, he wouldn't go up like that otherwise.",4
Shouldve checked the crease before the Chahal debate lol,4
Umesh woulda touched that,3
3rd Umpire : Task failed successfully,6
"Ffs should have checked whether he was in the crease the beginning, no need for the time waste.",1
Graeme Swann gets so excited for the smallest of things. I wish I had his enthusiasm for my life,7
"This is what I find moronic. Check everything first and _then_ make a decision ffs! The touch didn't even matter because he was in but the 3rd umpire spent a considerable amount of time _rock and rolling_. 

Dumb as shit",10
We are choking on this chase again,1
"Chronology samjhiye. First check if he's in, then roll it baby.",10
"They should've checked whether he made it inside the crease first, lmao. Would have saved time for sure",3
Atleast get a slip in,3
lol kanos even grounded his bat,5
Chagall could have gotten a dislocated finger there and the umpire would say ‚Äòinconclusive‚Äô.,4
[removed],13
There goes RCB's chance at Fairplay Award as well as the real IPL trophy.,8
Kane was clearly in,3
Was hoping for some juicy drama but kanos was comfortably in,6
"So Shamsuddin basically saw wrong on both counts..clear deviation but didn't bother to see whether Kane made his ground or not

Garbage",8
Wtf why wouldn't you check crease first? Is there a rule to evaluate step by step first?,10
[deleted],2
I swear if we loose this,8
Third umpire should be an IAS officer. Fucking time waster.,23
Yeah it‚Äôs not out anyway but how tf does Shamsuddin think a ball changes direction while in motion smfh,5
"Srh : *look at me , im punjab now*",12
"Anjum Chopra, Murali Kartik, KP and Sunny daddu need to be locked up during the IPL. Shockingly bad commentary.",14
4D strat by Thala bribing the 3rd umpire to make Kohli mad and make sure CSK stay at the top of the Fair play award,13
"Spend all that time seeing if he touched the ball when the whole time the bat was in the crease, incompetence",12
Can we use ultraegde for these kind of reviews? Im dumb,3
Give hairdryer to Chahal already,2
Shamsuddin sounds so drunk and dumb not just from this incident but any other time I‚Äôve seen him,1
Why can't the umpire check if the batsman is in first? Collosal time waste.,3
SRH is the only team in the league that could need to go at under 5 an over with 9 wickets in hand and still have us on the verge of a fucking heart attack,12
Man the confidence levels in Chahal literally polar opposite to Kuldeep who can‚Äôt get a game,9
"Why did the umpire not check whether Kane was in or not? Finger touching was not conclusive, but this was conclusive. Why didn't the umpire care to make a conclusive decision on priority?",2
Just a Hatrick and RCB are back in the game,5
"SRH got a way superior run rate to all the others in the race. Second best behind MI. They don't need to hurry.

Could be what happened in KXIP match where they overdid that, but with Kanos around there'll be constant rotation.",1
"Kohli like bhen**** how dare you umpire that you doubt the integrity of my bowler. FFS, the batter was in.. What idiocy.",2
[deleted],6
People saying they should check if he was inside the line first don't understand the concept of run out in cricket.,5
That was very well played by Saha,1
"In world of 4K cameras, third umpires still can't see obvious things, can they !?",2
"With the amount of money poured in IPL, BCCI can surely afford Hotspot tech",7
"Was going to sleep, but I cant go sleep without seeing complete chahal's spell.",3
all they we need to play is tuk tuk and take the odd boundary... but you never know this is T20,3
RCB truly are the meme-st of meme teams. Can't believe I was watching footage of a finger on a ball for a whole minute,15
KP the legend https://mobile.twitter.com/KP24/status/1322453640360173568,5
Who tf even came up with the term 'Rock and Roll',3
"Kohli was likely asking if on field umpire gave soft signal of out and if that should stay if third umpire doesn‚Äôt have conclusive evidence, on fiend umpire probably told him there is no soft signal for this",6
What a shit ball.,2
"So how many people are rooting for RCB win apart from RCB fans?

I'm here for the memes if RCB gets knocked out again if they lose both their matches.",2
"Kohli should part ways with RCB for the better good of both. RCB under kohli has been a disaster, except 2016. Any other IPL captain would be sacked with such a high failure %",7
Saha flexing to Koach who the real 3-format keeper is.,5
"Saha is a mature player,. Where did srh hide him",4
We should have Unacademy ‚Äúdon‚Äôt learn from the worst‚Äù montage showing bad things that teams and umpires do.,4
"Who has a right to blame the dew: Chahal

Who actually blames the dew: Thala",6
"Offtopic - dc vs rcb match, ash bowling to abd kohli in non striker, Ashwin mankades kohli and dc goes to playoffs.. the scenes!?",4
So much dew and this fucking clown said at the toss that he wanted to bat first *anyway* lol,18
That ball right there was exactly why Udana was dropped,4
Man really wanted to see SRH chase it down in 13 overs.,3
Udana taking advantage of the slow pitches by bowling a full toss,12
Was that a no ball?,1
Saha > Bairstow,1
why are we still here?,2
RCB being meme RCB again,5
Udana > Morris,2
That Siraj spell against RR is the death knell of RCB rofl,1
"Like Hazelwood once said, Who the fuck is the third umpire?",2
Kohli is the main reason I do not like RCB. His attitude is so rude almost all the time,0
Nehra ji must love length ball more then his wife.,5
RCB losing fair play too,2
"By any chance, do we(SRH) have a chance to finish in Top 2?",1
"Evidence of finger touch was inconclusive. Once you accept that, then benefit of the doubt went to batsman. The very fact that commentators and fans here are discussing is pointing to the conclusion that the touch wasnt clear.",3
saini would be proud of that...,3
Nice bowling udana,1
How the fuck is that not a no ball,3
"Did anjum called chahal Kohli's go-to man? Chahal was bought in when match was over... Hardly looks like it...
He should be the go-to but kohli dont take enough risk in mixing bowling combos.",1
Udana trying to kill willaimson,2
Probably irrelevant right now but why is AB keeping when we have Josh in the team?,2
"RCB fans, why y'all even watching still?",2
FUCK RCB!!!!!,0
"This happened earlier in this year's IPL too where the batsman was in but the 3rd umpire kept wasting time by checking if the bowler touched the ball. I remember Bhogle saying something like ""In the end the right decision was made but it was reached in the wrong manner"". Does anyone remember which match it was?",7
Noball,5
NOT A NO BALL WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK,3
How is that not a no ball,3
"Wait, WHAT AHAHAH WHAT???",6
WHAT SHIT UMPIRING. THAT WAS ON HIS NECK,6
Bruh that is a huge no ball,4
This is shambolic umpiring benchod are you fucking mad??????,7
Umpires doing drugs,7
"But shouldn‚Äôt the umpires have checked whether the bat was in or not,then the ball touching the hand wouldn‚Äôt matter",5
Clear no ball benchods. Fucking idiots,5
Disgusting fucking umpiring. What the fuck,6
That decision was fucking brain dead. Umpires really should start being penalised,5
Jeez fucking mate how is that not a no ball..,6
WTF?,6
"Before you call them shit bowlers, go to an actual cricket ground and check how much dew affects when you bowl with a cricket bowl. It's not fucking easy",6
Wtf?,5
Wtf how is that not a no ball.,6
Lmaoooooooo,2
Should just retire the team ffs.,3
To wtf why is it not a no ball,3
Shit umpiring,3
Umpire r-worded,2
Wtf how is that not a no ball?,2
Bruh what are these umpires smokin,3
In today's episode of shit umpiring,3
Wait that's not a no ball? What's up with this shithousery,3
Not a noball?,2
Umpire on kohlis payroll,5
The umpire is kidding,5
Really?,2
That was wild,2
Ball at his fucking head and not a noball? Revoke that umpire's credentials because he clearly does not deserve it,3
What the fuck is going on. Umpiring is shittier than DC' batting,2
"Only above waist is a no ball, above shoulder is fine.",32
Joke umpiring,4
Wtf,3
What a shit umpiring fuck this,7
umpire blind,4
Next level umpiring,5
Can Chahal just bowl the rest of the 12 overs.. What a bowler.. Him and rashid in the same team would be bonkers,5
Udana got away with that one lmao,7
"Who do you think, from the regular commentary team, should be called in Dugout ?",2
Massive beamer,3
"Imagine, if kohli's at the crease and umpire didn't give this as a no ball üòÇ",10
It‚Äôs on the fucking face high.,7

Ayy we back to shitty umpiring... I missed you,5
Can't see kohli arguing over that bad decision. Hmmmm,8
This is worse umpiring than my 40 yo drunk uncle volunteering for the neighborhood kids,8
Umpire giving chance to RCB loooool,8
That was like head height wtf,10
Lol they were looking at all the different camera angles of his hand when kanos was in the entire time,11
So the pace of the ball comes into account for a waist high no ball.,2
We don't need umpires,11
My grandma can be a better umpire than these waste of space cunts,12
Umpires probably got orders from above to make things *spicy* today,3
What a shit show,3
Umpire chut. Was a fuckin baseball throw and not a noball?,10
Kohli shoud STFU,1
These umpires are giving Cuneyt Cakir a run for his money,1
Umpire thinking about dinner,5
It's a no ball wtf,4
Udana‚Äôs cutters make him a slow bowler kappa,3
Village umpiring,8
The worst bit of umpiring I have seen in a long time.,11
"Kohli  makes umpires nervous, I'm sure",13
Kohli is smirking that umpire missed to call it a no ball.,13
"What's worse than one Indian umpire?

  


Two",21
Are you fucking kidding me,5
Umpires give a bouncer at that height lol,8
WTF is this shit,5
That's the blatantly worst call I've ever seen.,8
T f is going on,2
Man even the U-14 level has better umpiring than this fucking shit,11
"What a shit show this match is, wow.",3
*Abe iss se acha umpire toh meri gully ke 80 years old andhe uncleji hai*,7
Classic IPL... Mi and CSK not caring about other team performances,11
"If RCB doesn‚Äôt qualify to the playoffs this season, would this be the biggest choke that RCB has ever done in IPL history?",9
You still have time mr ump,6
Umpires so arrogant still not calling it after watching the replay,7
"Incompetent on field umpires 

Incompetent third umpire 

What the fuck are the players supposed to do man?  What's the fucking use of technology?",11
"Looking at the shit show with umpires, I'm really glad csk wasn't playing instead of RCB.",4
Folks. Remember. One of these 2 teams (RCB or DC) who have given clown performances today will be in the top 2. Never forget that.,7
Freshie umpires,3
What do you mean there's no ball? I can clearly see a white ball.,8
That was chest fucking height Jesus,5
why didn‚Äôt the third umpire even step in,3
Is umpire dreaming? How is that not a no ball,4
Why should Ambani's and Srini mama have all the fun üòÇüòÇüòÇ,1
"Thanks for your service umpires, Ill send in the check later.",2
"Every year in ipl we ask ""is this the worst standard of umpiring"" and then the next ipl arrives",2
Kaneos is too nice to even be mad at that umpire for that god awful decision,3
new ball? Second chance for the lord?,3
Lol the umpiring in this match. They're trying to one up RCB in memeness,5
Peak IPL umpiring,5
3rd umpire should be able to overrule,6
"Fun fact: it is so easy to trigger the Mumbai fans even though they all claim to be humble lol.

First off lads, it‚Äôs super easy to be humble if you have won the damn thing 4 times.

Second, i saw your reactions after the RR match.  

Third, *it‚Äôs even year and nothing happens anyway for Mumbai*. So why they fuck do you guys care to watch anyway and not just come next year or some shit.

Finally, stop being some greater fans when deep down we are all the same and some are okay expressing it.",4
Dugout is ripping into the umps lmao,11
Have the rules changed overnight,5
So when Kohli makes a valid inquiry to the umpire he‚Äôs a sore loser but when Kane Williamson asks for the no ball he‚Äôs a gentleman?,3
Why can't the 3rd umpire check that? Coz he checks front leg no ball too.,5
Euthanize these umpires. If y'all wanna be dead then actually be dead. How the fuck is that not a no ball. And I support RCB. What a joke.,10
Umpiring ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°,4
Indian umpire have been absolutely shit,9
I know it's Halloween but umpire decisions being this horrifying,18
Umpiring is atrocious,6
"Worst possible outcome gonna happen for Kings XI, Rajestan and KKR",1
Umpire phazed out for that ball..lol,2
Some top class umpiring in display once again :),2
The umpires are being neutral by showing impartiality to both teams equally.,3
"If this was CSK, r/cricket would have blamed MS",29
They can STILL refer it upstairs. What a madarchod.,8
Damn! Wasn‚Äôt that a no ball,2
Love how they decided to show the umpires names after not giving that no ball call so everyone can abuse them by name lol,11
Umpires are so fucking shit,5
My 10 year old nephew would do much better umpiring ü•±.,9
Can't players review such utter shit decisions?,6
"Uncle is sleeping, how's that not a no ball and why is third ump not interfering. Standards are very low.",12
Fuck this umpire. What's his name?,6
Williamson should've gone for a review if he could. Ffs this is absolutely unacceptable,8
At the fucking least talk to the 3rd umpire.,4
"Anju please stfu jinxing SRH.

You are trying too hard",5
"Miss umpires like simon taufel and billy 

The fact that i dont even know the names of any other umpire says a lot",14
Saha has been really impressive. I wish he could get gotten a chance ahead of Samson or Pant in Australia..,1
Giroud vs Messi,3
"Diplomatic commentator: Use the technology available.
Swann: Use your EYES!",28
I'm liking Saha's game today. Not throwing away his wicket and slowly building his innings.,6
Third umpire - It wasn't conclusive enough if it was no ball or not .,12
Umpires taketh umpires giveth,0
Damn Kohli found out 4D Thala strat  and is trying to get back those fair play points.,6
"SRH and poor umpire decisions, name a more iconic duo",2
Every Indian umpire  except the pirate umpire has been dog shit,14
I once tried bowling a back-of-the-hand delivery. It floated in the air for a while üòî,4
The Malinga no ball non-call was much more egregious than what happened today.,3
Umpire was taking a nap guys....spare him...,7
Somebody take the mic away from Anjum,5
"Why new ball? If there is dew, doesn't mean a new ball should be given no?",15
DRS needs to be extended to wide and no ball reviews. Basically decision review system than wicket review system.,10
Dugout is just Swann hijacking everyone's commentary,20
Kohli threatened the umpires with the termination of their contract obviously,22
Wtf is nehra commenting ü§∑,9
"At this rate of umpiring, if RCB still don't win, then it's hard to make them win even the next one.",8
Kane trying to replicate Manish Pandey's 15(29),0
"Nice guy Kanos let that slide with a smile.

Someone like Dhoni, Koach or Warner in that situation would have been risking a suspension.",29
Umpires: I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that,13
Umpire‚Äôs bad decision making was Phillipe‚Äôs fault,12
Is there a points system for Umpires? Iirc they have one but not sure if there's one for IPL too.,6
Beautiful umpiring,5
Umpires are being fair tbh. Helping SRH once and helping RCB the other time.,2
"I wonder how many careers have been ended by Indian umpires in domestic cricket.  
  
Also, given the noise around nepotism in India...umpiring is one of the MOST nepotistic professions in the country. The job is almost transferred through generations, to hell with quality",13
Call wides ffs!!!,4
"Kohli is probably the luckiest player to be captain. 
Despite such poor performance as a captain in the past 10 years.",6
"This is just stupid umpiring, I hate Indian umpires",8
Petition to make swanny the third umpire,8
That was a wide. Man this is a comedy show now,3
Davey Warner was almost ready to perform the Butta Bomma to intimidate the umpire.,8
"top 2 spot up for grabs

RCB: Imma collapse",3
I'm sorry that ball was so high it could have been given no ball if it had bounced first.,3
Wtf ????,1
"Wtf,that is a wide",2
Wide come on,1
What the hell is wrong with the umpiring! That was face high and not given a no ball! Umpire is high or something?,5
Dude this is ridiculous. What the flying fuck. That literally was a fucking face beamer,6
OMG. Abduct these umpires and leave them in the middle of a desert,5
finally power is back i can watch the game,3
Wtf?,3
Cameraman has to show Koach picking his ears lol,7
Steve Buckernesque,3
What's the name of the umpire and leg umpire ?,2
Can umpires be spot-fixing?,6
Why isn't Udana throwing beamers every ball if beamers are allowed from now?,6
What the fuck is going on,2
Literally shit umpires here,2
Umpires need fair play points too,6
"https://mobile.twitter.com/JofraArcher/status/1322580513891246082

Even Jofra talking about that",7
The only positive thing about this match is that our NRR won't take as much of a hit as DC's,3
Guys what's your opinion on this: Any other franchise would have sacked their Captain after so many years of failures.,12
"Feel umpiree specially just fear kohli , dhoni or other Indian stars shd not be th case though , the handtouch not given which wouldn't have mattered  , kohli arguing would have feared umpires ...",5
Buckneresque,5
Shocking umpiring. Makes my blood boil. Incompetent fucks.,8
"rcb theme song : hum paagal nai hai bhaiya,hamara dimaag kharab hai.",3
MC kya chutiya umpiring bkl,5
Where did they get idiot umpires from?,3
Wide de maadarchod. Tatti umpiring. Even non cricket fans will tell its a no ball,11
What the fuck didn't he call the other one bouncer then what is this then?,6
Can't tell if umpire is supporting RCB or against them.,7
Nehraji super upset over umpire lol,8
Now Malya has joined bribe umpire club,10
Joke,6
"""I'm off to take an umpiring course"" - Swann, 2020

Why was the no-ball not given and the last ball wide?",19
Imagine if this kinda shit happened during the final,5
"chahal has been the best indian spinner this IPL. Bowled with great control and takes wickets fairly regularly. kuldeep on the other hand has barely played for KKR :-(

So this IPL will go to last match before we know who would qualify. MI will play winner of RCB/DC for qualifier but 3rd and 4th place is up in the air. DC could miss play offs if they lose to RCB. We just need KXIP and SRH to win their final games. KXIP, RR, KKR all need to go for big wins to have real hope of making play offs. SRH will easily qualify if they win against MI.",1
Swanny doesn't give a shit about the umpires.,3
"I always suspected, IPL matches are rigged to go on as long as possible to rake in the advertising money. That's the reason no free hit was given to SRH",3
Surely lord gets the new ball to redeem himself?,1
"I should have known from the start,it‚Äôs not possible for Rcb to qualify easily they somehow will find a way to take it to the last game and make the fans have their hearts in the mouth. Atleast we have this suspense what do you Mi fans have? /s",5
They even changed the wet ball as well but couldn‚Äôt bother calling the 3rd umpire for no ball. Pretty ridiculous.,3
"Hey look at me kids I have no legs, LEARN CODING YA LITTLE SHITS",29
"Make this shit trend in Twitter bois. Use #UmpireGate or #NoBallGate or some shit.

Fuck that umpire.",3
The quality of umpires has drastically gone down in the recent years.,4
Saha really have a thing for weaker teams like DC and RCB. Weak team bully üòÜ,6
Bcci need to invest big bucks in training some decent umpires,2
Is Aleem Dar banned from the IPL?,0
"Nice Saha, win it under 13 overs",1
That ball was higher than Marlon Samuels,7
"I don‚Äôt know why I am mad that wide is not given, considering they didn‚Äôt give that no ball.",5
"What a shot ,full of confidance.",2
Women‚Äôs T20 team names are far better than IPL names,2
Pathak gets so much stick for his long hair but he has been the best Indian umpire by a mile.,6
Umpires are the new referees of football now,5
saha for t20i? üò≥,3
"What a beautiful shot, Saha!",4
Saha > Pant,5
"If it wasn't kanos batting, maybe someone like thala or koach, they would've spanked the umpire with their bat for that decision, and I wouldn't be mad",9
"DC was piss poor today..

RCB- Hold my üç∫",8
press F,3
SAHA  the magician,3
Isuru Udana's figures just got saved by the umpire.,4
Saha if not for his injuries would've been a decent batsman in LOIs.,7
Fucking fixed by the umpires... If Kohli was the batsman instead of Kane they would've given the free hit without a second thought,12
Saha turning fortunes for SRH,7
One part of me want rcb to win and reach the playoffs easily. Other part of me wants them to shit the bed so bad the kohli is forced to make an apology video like he made last year,14
Its been a great IPL. But today is some of the worst cricket I have ever seen.,4
VK and team laughing about that no ball not being called one. I am glad that they haven't won IPL even once for their arrogance then will go over the roof.,12
I genuinely feel bad for the kids whose parents will enroll them in that whitehatjr shit,10
How has Chahal not played a test for India?,4
"Is there fair play award for umpires, where players can rank who was less shitty? I feel there should be.",7
"What should happen for teams to qualify: given SRH wins today

RCB - Win against DC and they are in top 2 or  either of SRH and KXIP should lose

DC - Same as RCB

KXIP - Win next match

KKR - Win against RR and SRH and KXIP should lose their matches

RR - same as KKR

SRH - Win against MI",7
"Lauda chus S. Ravi, you dumb piece of shit",2
What do RCB fans have to say about this?,7
there should be an eye test for umpires before selection,8
"I won't lie, this match has been unnecessarily spicy",4
Fucking assholic umpires. What is this?,3
Ump should be happy it was Kane at the strikers end. If Pollard had been given that decision he would've slapped the ump üòÇ,11
the commentator is so annoying,3
Man Kane is too nice to pressure the umps,5
Saha looks like the players from stick cricket. The body and the face both.,7
Why are teams batting first playing like gully cricketers all of a sudden?,3
"RCB bought into the Finch hype and ruined the team. 

We can't play the best XI now.",2
The fact that every team gets fair 14 shots to qualify and still end up depending on other match results to make it is the comedy of the tragedy...,3
Do you guys remember that ODI game where kohli defended a free hit. Lmao,6
"With so much dew, batting second will almost always win now.",3
"Kohli the type of guy who would argue with on-field umpires regarding a decision made by 3rd umpire. Williamson the type of guy who won't even raise his voice when umpires don't give a chest level full toss, a no ball.",24
Still fucking pissed about that call,8
SRH robbed of some crucial extra's . 1 beamer 2 bouncers went unnoticed just like that.,8
"RCB should eat

Paan Bahar pehchan kaamyabi ki",4
It's all a conspiracy by the umpire's to make sure the second strategic time out is taken cus they don't want the game to end before the 13th over lmao,6
The difference between the wrist spinners Chahal and Kuldeep is that Chahal doesn't get afraid after getting hit for a six and continues to bowl that fuller length hoping that the batsman would hit him again and the gets caught on the boundary... Whereas kuldeep just lost all his confidence after that moeen ali fiasco last year,3
Mithali Raj still captaining a T20 side reminds me of Thala,6
If Yuzi don't get a wicket this over this match is all sealed and done.,8
"Wth with umpires sucking up to the likes of Dhoni/Kohli in IPL, like seriously every decision invariably goes in their favour, someone needs to establish accountability for such blunders",4
3rd umpire should be able to overrule these chutiya decisions,7
Audacity of rcb players to laugh over no wide. Damnn,21
"kane's the best kane's the best kane's the best

am i doing it right?",3
"Like captains have fines for slow over rates and stuff, these bloody umpires must also be fined for such shit umpiring and must be discarded after 3 warnings. Taking everything for granted",8
"Like FairPlay Award given by Umpires

There should be a Umpire rating maybe xD",6
"Wait if srh wins this, that means that one of either rcb or dc won‚Äôt make playoff right?",11
Idk why I'm still watching,10
"After seeing performances of DC and RCB

Both teams be like

Our Battle will be Shitty :)",6
Why is a Leg bye is extra in cricket ? It's counted against the bowling team ...,2
"If DC lose against RCB in the next match, there‚Äôs a very good chance they‚Äôll be out of the playoffs",6
If that happened to Warner 100% he would‚Äôve gone ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna bat unless I get that checked by the 3rd umpire‚Äù.,9
It is so nice that scriptwriters add in a bunch of drama to make a bland match a little spicy.,10
"I'm pretty sure the umpire has been bought, thats the most basic stuff for an umpire, A person needs to be blind to not see that",9
Can't imagine if Dhoni was the one at receiving end of that no ball call. Heads would fall lmao,20
Batsman should be able to review all umpiring decisions.. should stop all the shitshow,13
Take this to the 16th over atleast,1
If that no ball was to Dhoni he would have just stared at the umpire until it was a no ball and bowler removed from match,11
IPL really needs to get umpires with eyes and backbones (ref wide ball ft Dhoni),0
"I love Williamson for being as calm as he is

If kohli was there and umpire gave that decision , he would have called him ben stokes and smacked him with his bat or smthg lol",19
Bishnoi has the better googly. That's all he bowls,7
If there's no Ellyse Perry Women's T20 challenge is a second-tier competition IMO.,9
Why're they letting the ball roll along the grass like that?,7
"I guess considering so much pressure in international and even in IPL matches, there should be a age limit for umpires and that should be below 50.",12
Yessss Chahal,4
Rcb you were lucky that saint kane was facing that ball,12
A token tournament for women with generic team names is pathetic for the richest board in the game.,6
"after all the talk about whether we should play pant in t20s, turns out saha is the best choice",8
Wtf... No need for that,9
Kane made too much pressure on Saha,4
Oh ffs. Imo we should still be able to win,8
Umpires giving content for next year's Lenskart ad.,15
[deleted],4
Wondering if the umpire saw his foot grounded inside here as well,8
"Rashid is a Magician, but Chahal is a Genius.",9
Let's go Chahaal!!!!,6
WHYYYYY THIS IS THE ONE BOWLER YOU CAN LITERALLY PLAY OUT MAIDENS AGAINST,15
"Well played Saha, you did your part",6
chahal you fuckin beautss,2
[removed],35
Saha is now waiting for Chahal to play Tests. Will miss stumpings off him for revenge.,8
Idea: an umpire leaderboard for the percentage of correct decision by each umpire and an award at end of tournament for the best one,9
At least RCB is having fun lmao,7
Could have hit it for 6 tbh,1
"Imagine Kohli's situation. He cannot blame the toss now as he publicly declared that they wanted to bat first. FFS, why betray your fears by this false bravado. Atleast you could have got toss as a nice excuse when you lost. Learn from Dhoni in these matters.",38
"l'm still laughing about that no ball, pure Indian meme league gold",11
Chahal magical again. Hope he does the same in the T20 WC,4
gully cricket umpires look internationals in front of them.,5
Saha upholding the SRH tradition in this IPL...,7
How tf does Chahal manages to pick a wicket when needed.,6
C‚Äômon Rcb there‚Äôs still hope. After all it‚Äôs Srh we‚Äôre playing,2
"If SRH lose this by a run, just fuck off umpires and never show your bloody face",11
Just about to say Saha is playing sensible,4
"**10.6** Chahal to Saha, OUT,  **82-3**

WP Saha st &dagger;de Villiers b Chahal 39 (32b 4x4 1x6) SR: 121.87",3
Royal Collapsers Bangalore,3
"why tf did he have to hit , wait it out man",6
"Come on Kane, do a gurkeerat",0
Woahhh the amount of spin,3
Aww the drift in that bowl. Chahal you beauty.,3
is it just me or anyone else notixing intentional delays between balls by RCB?,7
Reminded me of those good old days of Kul-cha. Chahal is doing good but Kuldeep seems nowhere currently.,3
SRH meltdown gonna start?,2
Chahal is such a child.,4
Kohli should ball for memes,3
CHAHAL YOU BEAUTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,5
"like how koach talked to chahal just before this ball and then he got a wicket but no one will recognise it

if thala or rohit did this everyone would be giving them a bj by now",21
chahal deserves better,11
Omg just take singles pleaseüò≠,7
Upgrad degrees are useless,3
WHY WHY WHY ARE YOU NOT PLaying chahal out oh my god,6
"If srh loose by anything less than 6 run margin, they should riot for the no ball and subsequent freehit..",5
Sundar or Saini please,2
"It‚Äôs fine if we loose this, we have the no ball debacle to make ourselves feel better",4
SKY took over Chahal quite effectively. One of the few.,9
idiotic batting!!! warner should kick him in the dressing room for this shit,2
Send Rashid out lol,2
"SRH needs to be given the fair play award, just for accepting that no ball decision.",10
Pretty against of spirit of cricket from AB there. No warnings smh.,17
"That no ball call is gonna somehow manage to lose us the game, watch",5
That leg spinner..chef's kiss,4
Don't think one bit that this game is done,3
Genuine question. What happens if we lose against DC too?,9
"On a positive note, chahal only has one over left",7
"Saha is another of those idiots who doesn‚Äôt know how to play according to the situation

Still can‚Äôt forget that crazy shot he tried in Adelaide to get out with Kohli at the other end.",5
Tbh our bowling has been better than batting this season.,9
Can someone notify SRH that they have the second best NRR in the tournament and just need to see off Chahal? Thanks,5
"Nice to see happy Chahal, I met him once on airport. Cool guy.",9
Fuck fuck no srh collapse pls I want more drama in the points table,2
Into the tail.,2
RCB would be relegated without chahal lol,7
[deleted],1
"We can't seriously lose from here.

But then again that KXIP match is still fresh in my mind",2
Yo can I be umpire for next season?,5
Teams that batted first won nearly every game in the beginning and now they're losing every game,4
"Such brainfade, it was the last ball of the over. Why?",2
"Since there are limited reviews, why can't you use wherever you want.",1
Stop giving me false hope RCB....,1
Why did RCB bat first at this venue though?,1
The tail is in,1
And so it begins...,3
"Match will go to a superover. You heard it here first folks.


Then it will also be a tie so there will be a Butta Bomma competition between Davey and Kilo, and Davey will sweep the floor with Viral Kilo due to his supreme dance moves.


/s",8
Has SRH secured this game or could there be some more unintended hiccups?,2
"What a ball...

Wriddhi WHY????",4
Fun Fact: Harbhajan Singh does rubbish commentary In hindi feed. But he himself watches the IPL on Eng feed,6
If SRH chases it in 14.3 overs. The NRR of RCB will be worse than KXIP.,6
Warner shud call out umpires. Fuck fairplay points,10
Srh need to win to calm the rcb players the fuck down. What isthis attitude,5
How the hell is DeVIlliers such a good wicketkeeper? I thought he was a dogshit stumper from what RCBc fans g=have been crying about no keeper.,6
I wonder if people will trend this Kohli chatter with Chahal like they do so with Rohit or Dhoni?,10
Supporting both SRH and Tottenham is the worst of both worlds. The most bottley fucks in existence,5
"Play out Rashid, don't attack Chahal. How hard is it?",19
How many times have we seen Chahal take wicket like this and batters still don't learn.,9
Why don't we make Chahal captain? I love his positivity.,23
"The chase feels good , much slower than before

Amazing",3
If we choke this I'll be rocking that RCB flair.,13
Yuzi tossed it like a salad,6
Chahal deserves a better team,13
"At this point, I'm just gonna hope for a Sunrisers choke. Kane no intent Williamson will try to take this to the end.",4
8-10 second chat confirmed,3
daddy chahal only behind bumrah and rabada for purple cap,11
"This is the reason why Williamson is picked by SRH, to have that assurance and guarantee.",20
"Look at all the Kohli this Kohli that comments every day now mocking his every move.

Now that Dhoni is on his way out, Indian fans need to find that next target to continue the hate train. You can already see that the next target is Kohli and the hate is slowly building in the last 18 months.

From here on whatever he does in the next few years he will be mocked.

Kapil to Sachin to Dhoni to Kohli next the train will continue. The bigger the star your are the more of the adulation will convert to hate by the end of their careers.

Typical Indian trait that they always need someone to hate/blame to get by their day to day frustrations in life and sleep well.",-5
"I think nobody has told srh that they just have to win both games and they qualify, nrr doesnt matter in their case",5
Man this Anjum lady needs to stfu,24
lmao why does Kohli not trust Siraj with the new ball,3
If KKR and CSK win both DC and RCB go through to playoffs?,4
If Kohli was so good at set ups there would be way more wickets taken lol,13
SRH is the real ‚Äòtake it deep‚Äô team,6
"""What kind of setup Anjum?""",19
SunnyG calling Anjum out on her statements lol,17
Wtf is Anjum on about? She's a weird commentator.,9
"When Kohli went to ask for a ball change, I thought that he'd ask the umpire to give the no ball, well maybe in spirit of the game. This kind of umpiring is abysmal",8
Imma be salty about that no ball even if SRH wins.,25
Chahal is pure genious,5
Tbh anjum is kinda dumb,4
Kane wicket here,1
"Mindless dismissals, all till now. Needless attacking shots",1
[deleted],6
Sundar is easy to score off out of the powerplays,1
Please tell me there's no fucking chance of us screwing this up.,3
Excellent fielding by padikkal,1
Test player Kane Williamson gets a chcnace but two time T20 WC final MOM Marlon Samuels gets no chance in IPL. What a joke!,9
That's all you guys need. Singles.,3
"ABD is super Positive with everything & Kohli is super Negative with everything, no wonder opposite attracts each other.",9
"Please, lady, I cannot deal with the second-hand embarrassment. Just admit you were wrong",6
"\>   If RCB take this game beyond 14.3 overs, they will still have a better net run rate than KXIP

 May be thats what umpires are helping with ;)",8
Anjum is talking garbage,2
Does Kohli have any say in picking out umpires for an IPL season?,1
"what would happen if a fast bowler just bowls really slow, like 80 kmph? why hasnt anyone tried that",3
If RCB lose this they need to lose bad lol,1
Now is the time for Abhishek to make his case.,1
"IMPORTANT: If RCB take this game beyond 14.3 overs, they will still have a better net run rate than KXIP",5
"Warner, Kohli, Dhoni. Probably the only 3 Ipl captains who might be willing to call out umpires",4
So we all going to ignore tuk tuk kane?,1
Why SRH is not playing Priyam?,1
"Abhishek plz do something :"")",1
"Williamson scores 8 off 11 : oh dear oh gorgeous

Koach  scores 9 off 12 : you fucking donkey",12
"I guess you could say...   

*puts on sunglasses*  

They got rid of man. (wri-ddi-man)  



I'll see myself out",4
Guys still cant get my head around how that was not a no ball what explanation would umpire give if asked about it not conclusive enough???,3
Anjum: sab pata karenge hum CID hain,5
"Fuck off with the ""chat with the captain"" nonsense. Only Wasim Akram is allowed to do that.",0
Chahal has 100% win percentage as a captain for rcb practice matches.,21
"If Kane gets out this over, it will become very competitive.",5
Anjum has been around for quite some time. Always has sucked at commentary.,2
There's a little bit of Jadhav spirit within Abhishek. RCB should explore that.,2
Gawaskar bullying anjum chopra lol,4
So no winning before 14.3 overs and do KXIP a favor,4
SRH are dearly missing the services of Vijay Shankar,2
Only if RCB managed to score 30 more runs.,6
Anjum Chopra is one of the worst commentators ever,3
That's some sick observation from Bangar!,1
"Guys, I created a new discussion post, feel free to contribute and comment.


[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jllvhq/ipl_razzie_awards_2020/)",1
Makes one wonder how many crease no-balls go unnoticed by these sleeping umpires,3
Replace Anjum with Isa Guha,3
Who‚Äôs this new girl in the jio ad?,1
I think there should be one non-wicket review with the teams to review no ball/wide decisions. Why not give the teams a chance to overturn clear incorrect decisions for those as well.,1
Gaya match. Bhenchod,1
Wtf is this shit,2
All Pandey had to was not to attack Chahal for an easy win. But no he doesn't want that,3
SRH collapse incoming,1
"If they can get Williamson, Sunrisers can def choke this",4
p a n i c,1
"There is 12 balls of spin remaining . Don‚Äôt try anything crazy . Just knock it around for singles as much as possible . Even if then can 6-7 out of those 12 balls pretty good result .

That would mean they would just need 27 of 36 deliveries . Very easy chase still. Just bat sensibly for once particularly now that Williamson is gone.",2
CRUMBLEE,1
Thank you chahal! For saving RCB's NRR,3

Ok one more over of chahal just play it safe.,2
Uno reverse by Kholi.,9
Is the game still one sided or Rcb can somehow win this?,5
"Even if we win the game, the coaches should sit Pandey and saha down and tell them how important it is to close out games",6
SRH what is u doing baby,9
It's literally the same way Kohli got out. And he takes the catch. WoW,14
Oh boy how the hell do you find a way everytime to bottle games SRH?,4
Here come the SRH,1
"Having Holder, Samad and Rashid after  gives a little tineesy bit confidence if the score is below 20",3
Big fish üêü caught by VK,3

You know the rules and so do I,3
Yess Izy!!!,5
Fuck yes Udana. That's a beauty.,7
Hell yeah Udana!!,8
Too late?,3
What just happened?,3
creative ways to lose ft. SRH,6
Very similar dismissal to Kohli,2
Finally some interesting cricket today? Well i guess,7
Kohli pulling an uno reverse against Kane lol,10
That's the game boys...why cant we just knock it around ffs,5
Good guy Kane wanted to return the catch practice Kohli gave him,7
That's some give back by koach,2
GOTE MUH ME AAAGAYEEEE,3
hahaha this cant be real.. first they choked against KXIP.. surely they cant choke again...,2
Very stupid from Kanos,2
This might be one of the oddest matches and run chases ever.,3
Ahhh the collapse started...,3
"Ffs, we're doing it again",2
Either lose or win it with two overs to spare ffs. Winning it in the last over would be the worst possible result for us,3
Kanos?,1
Absolute collapse,3
Wow kanos pulled of a koach there,4
oh no they're not losing are they,3
"SRH bois please end our suffering fast

I cant take false hope anymore I'm dead inside",5
"Lol... What morons, are these international best?",4
Don't do that RCB and SRH. Don't give me hopesüò≠üò≠,3
SRH really wants to beat 17-7,7
Are SRH about to bottle this?,3
Sheet! The beginning of the exit from the tournament for SRH. Such a shit batting line up,3
oh no srh,2
Well.. Fuck..,3
lmao stfu,2
Just fuck off man,2
"No, I'm sorry, there's absolutely no way, SRH are losing this. Not even KXIP would lose from here.",3
wholesome KS giving catch to Kohli,8
Who would've thought some people miss 3D even when kanos was in the team,3
"SRH losing this. SRH middle order is the cricket realisation of a deer getting caught in the headlights, watching its approaching death while frozen and unable to do anything but die pathetically.",0
disband this team if they lose from here.,8
Ha fucking hell,7
kohli just played reverse uno against kane,5
SRH got the same script as the KXIP game,2

"SRH: Look at me, I'm the RCB now...",4
here we go.,1

Kohlapse",5
"**12.1** Udana to Williamson, OUT, and what a bowling change it has proved to be. Williamson has chipped one straight to short extra cover. Slower offcutter, on a length, and he ends up pushing at this well in front of his body. Easy catch to Kohli at extra cover **87-4**

KS Williamson c Kohli b Udana 8 (14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14",2
Do we really deserve it to go to the playoffs?,2
"Lightning doesn't strike the same place twice, SRH you got this.",2
Kohli with the uno reverse card on Kane there,3
RCB is still in the game. SRH can still screw up things.,2
Butterfly effect: Kane was internally upset about the no ball incident. This forced him to play a rash shot straight into the hands of Koach.,3
"SRH - please, please, don't trigger my PTSD",7
"Okay, this is a real tricky situation for SRH. Can Holder guide them home?",2
Oh FFS! FMFL!,5
No way kane atleast you could have stood up for the wide/no ball,1
Giving me hope to destroy it all again. Classic RCB,2
Bhenchod Kohli. Don't you dare call my Kanos a bhenchod.,3
Srh man not again,3
Calling it now we choke this hard and  get all out before 100.,2
"RCB win a must for us, right?",1
"Here we go again, typical RCB game",2
I also feel that Kane's hamstring Injury reoccured. He was limping slightly.,3
"If SRH lose by 2-3 runs, everyone should blame the umpires.",3
Even if they just bat it out....even dew can win it,2
Choke! choke! Choke!,3
"Should send Holder in now . He is not a slogger so give him some time to get in and rotate strike.

He is more than capable of taking them home",4
Hahahaha we're losing this. I can smell it.,5
I love the way this game is heading to.,3
Warnlapse,3
"Lmao, Kane is out.

Now SRH can mega choke this.",3
Bloody Bangar. Doesn't shut up,2
2 half csk is better than both rcb and srh..,3
Too late? Atleast ma bois are fighting. I can't blame our bowlers tbh. Our batting has been shit,3
What did Anjum say? Context pls anyone.,3
Only with srh are you worried that they can‚Äôt score 34(47),2
"everyone who was asking why SRH fans are so damn pessimistic, this is why",4
Can we still win?,2
holder will win this with his long levers,1
C'mon srh bottle this,3
[lmao this comment aged badly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jlhd8m/match_thread_52nd_match_royal_challengers/gapfw8x?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),1
"Srh ain't winning this. 

*Ptsd from kxip match*",4
Good lord Anjum commentary is worst than Sanjay manjarekar.,5
Guys chill. No way SRH will bottle this again,4
Jason Holder does play the calm game well.,2
Mishraji's wig is so odd looking,1
Why Samad didn't come,1
Chahal has one more over if he can. Break this middle order we might actually win .don't do this don't give me hope.,3
"Kohli caught Kane at short extra cover, the exact place where Kane caught Kohli",5
That was a loose ball and even looser shot there from Kanos. Utterly woeful there from someone who shows so much composure,5
Cunt 5 sixes and be done with it.,6
Saha you absolute tit. Why the fuck did he go after Chahal of all the fucking bowlers,4
Am I the idiot here for watching this game?,3
"Everyone else bat's with a bat, Holder bat's with a toothpick",8
WHo was saying Koach is a terrible captain?,-3
I think Holder will take them home.,2
"Honestly, I'm not even surprised at these batting collapses. Get one or two wickets and you've practically beaten SRH..",1
"Reason Chahal gets wickets has to do with his personality. He knows his limitations and bowls to his strengths. Like many, he has his off days. But he doesnt get bogged down by it. He is grounded and knows he has to work to get wickets. And does that well and keeps improving.",10
Rcb‚Äôs game to lose from here.,1
SRH are dead if youngsters dont show up today,5
17-7 pleaseeeee,8
s haarich,1
"Beautiful set up by Udana, pushed him back with the magic legal beamer",6
Jesus Christ Holder is tall,4
3 tight overs and the match is on.,3
"I fucking hate to see this shitten Williamson bat, He bats like he has no power?! Wtf, atleast try to hit you stupid fuck. Now he is out",-4
"Parthiv patel must be included in the team instead of Mann. Also no need of extra bowler for rcb,",5
"Basically every team except MI is shit. It just shows up at different times. Except CSK, who have been shit mostly throughout.",10
Really irresponsible from Kane again. Disappointing.,6
"If only we scored 20 more 

Shit batting",11
I just realised they dropped Priyam. And they didn't even bowl Samad or Abhishek. Why even?,5
IT HIT THE ALTROZ!!!,5
Truth be told MI are the most deserving team to win. But Mumbai winning once again makes this tournament feel like dull and repetitive.,3
Srh have got nothing to worry. Holder can easily win it. Rashid yet to come. Chill guys,2
That was hit on altroz,1
IT HIT THE CAR LMFAOOOO,5
How many Siraj's overs left?,1
Calm the fuck down big daddy Jase,1
goddamit another choke? 120 FFS!,1
Holder almost put a hole in the Altroz,2
Still SRH match. Abhishek Sharma in his short career has played well against RCB,5
Finally someone try to hit the car,6
I mean holder can bat too did everyone forget,3
Kanos was probably thinking about his catch in the first innings before the ball,1
Lmao he hit the Altroz. You absolute madlad,11
Oh no,1
Pretty sure Koach will drop Udana for conceeding that six.,6
Kanos and Kohli playing catch catch üòÇüòÇ,4
srh pls,2
"Oh no the car!

Anyway",10
I think it is terrible for SRH to give no chances to Priyam Garg after his matchwinning 50 down the order early in the season.,3
"Holder Thanos : Fine, I'll finish it myself",5
Holder ain‚Äôt got time for this shit,5
fodo gaadi ka sheesha,6
Oh my god..code red..he just hit the beaUTIfuL altroz,7
I‚Äôm glad Kane isn‚Äôt on my team because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get mad at him even if he played poorly,2
Whole Subreddit presents award to Holder for cunting Altroz Cash Prize- RS 69,12
And Holder reduces it under 30.,1
It's easy to forget what a giant man Jason Holder is until you see him bat,4
"Holder hit the altroz.....

Friendship ended with everyone

Holder is my best friend",8
Jason (I don‚Äôt give a f) Holder,3
"i dont think SRH are gonna bottle this tho, but im having fun watching our bowling attack do something for a change after so many years",3
Not even one good wicket RCB took today. All were just SRH throwing away,4
Srh just need 30 runs from 7 overs,1
Holder with that West Indian power...,1
[deleted],2
Holder hit the Altroz boys,11
Much needed six,2
Fuck you Holder,0
Finally the altroz was hit.,5
"Finally, someone targets Altroz.",10
Yes finally someone hit that fucking ugly car,10
If only we got 20 runs more.,11
That shot killed me inside. Not gonna lie,9
Isn't Priyam Garg a better batsman than this Abhishek?,1
Finally someone hit that ugly car.,5
"Come on Phillipe, you gave up an extra run there",1
anjum is female manju,11
Thing with SRH NRR is that they can afford to win even on the last ball and they should be okay.,5
Yooo less go srh boisss,2
HE DID ITTTTTT FINALLY THE CAR HAS BEEN HIT,11
Yar sanjay bangar and Anjum Chopra ko koi maaro chapaal se,11
Destroy that Altroz Big Jason!!!,5

"The best thing about IPL is it compell you watch the match till the end.

Thriller√ó100",8
"Oh man, almost hit the Altroz",8
Fuck you altroz. Fuck capitalism,9
Best to keep hitting.  More dangerous to try and win with singles,8
"Srh: loses two quick wickets.. 

Me: Dont do this. Dont give me hope.",20
Smash that car. Smash the safest hatchback in India if not the world.,12
Juuust missed the Altroz window :(,2
They'll never show the dent,9
Swanny almost had an heart attck,9
"Altroz got hit, swanny must be bleeding through the eyes",2
Holder doesn't like that car :),3
Swann wouldnt like the fact that holder hit thr almighty altroz,4
Rcb fans still have hopes on this match..optimism,2
"Fuck the altroz

All my homies hate the altroz",14
"Kohli after the game 

""We were short by around 20 runs""

BRUH.",11
What is Udana blowing on to the ball ? Just air or something else.,3
trust holder and calm your tits,2
Knock knock...the safest car in india,6
The shield of safest hatchback of india broken finally,7

Why don't players just hit sixes like that?,5
The max fantasy points are 56 lol.,10
Holder be like imma test to see if it‚Äôs the safest car in India,34
So jason becomes the favorite player on r/cricket for that shot.,11
Yes holder aaram se khel bhai,3
This is a do over chance for the lower order... They must not fuck this up.,3
Holder almost destroyed the Altroz.,4
"If SRH wins, is RR out?",6
AFRINA sweets has gotten better advertisement value than WhiteHat this season,5
That's like 2 overs worth of runs in a ball,7
"Holder should be out, like that Dream 11 ad, ""khadoos ki gaadi ko lagna out hai bhidu""",6
I dont like Udanas run up.,3
Imagine Altroz windshield breaking when someone hits a six while commentators saying the safest car in India. Hard chance but would be funny as hell.,8
RRR is 3.5 can we still win?,7
"So, RCB will finish above DC today. GG",1
We were 20-30 runs short - Koach probably.,4
"We are fucking losing this. After watching that KXIP shitshow, I have zero hope",2
We either lose comfortably or win comfortably. Nothingin between,5
"No way SRH r gonna win against MI this way

Unless MI decides to play all their reserves",4
Fuck if holder takes us home then this team is sett,3
"Aight 9 balls left

Lets not get KXIP get ahead",5
Come on Chahal two wickets in the next over.,4
"It literally is a battle of who sucks worse lmao, I can't even...",4
HIT THE ALTORSZ,2
CMV Chahal best spinner in the world right now,1
I think they traded in Russell from KKR for Holder. There is a mid-tournament trade window actually this season.,1
"SRH need 26 off 7 with 6 wickets in hand....


Why're fans worried?",7
"Ado Udana, monawada yako karaney...",-1
Only way rcb can win the ipl is if they buy marlon samuels and he knocks out every bowler of the opponent team.,3
NRR calculation please?,4
I hope we r doing this to make mumbai feel that our team is weak enough for them to play their bench squad which will still probably beat us,9
Swann to show up at SRH hotel tonight in an Altroz!,2
RCB still have hope till now just because SRH is chasing... How bad we are,2
Chutia Kohli bowl spin to holder,3
"Sometimes, I feel it‚Äôs better SRH lose miserably so then I can watch IPL without the risk of a cardiac arrest. But where‚Äôs the fun in that?",5

Deztory that gaadi,2
"Who is more hopeless now?

RCB fans upvote

SRH fans downvote",2
Holder testing Altroz's gold standard in safety,2
Big mistake not bowling Chahal this over.,2
Bc Kohli choose extra pacer over a batsman on a spin friendly pitch. RCB things.,3
New game: the team that can break that car gets 2 points,3
That shot was scripted by Altroz to advertise its safety standard. Must say the marketing teams are getting innovative.,1
"Just need 25 of 7 overs not even 4 an over needed.

Should just play out a maiden against Chahal if needed. Don‚Äôt try anything silly",1
"Getting all these shit commentators to jizz on Altroz has ensured a lot of people will never buy it unless bullock carts are the only vehicles left on earth. 

Like imagine listening to Murali Kartik spew nonsense for 15 minutes about a game he was a professional at. Would you trust anything he ever says after that?",3
That's out,1
That's out if not edged,1
Holder is the best holder is the best holder is the best,1
Show the car you cowards. Let's if the 5 star safety thing is true,2
Fuck you umpire. What the actual fuckkkk.,1
Thank you holder for killing our hopes.,2
Fuckers managed to squeeze in an ad for Altroz while describing that six!,5
Looked out though,1
Holder looks good. That six might be the most important moment of the match,1
there is literally no way this hyderabad team will beat mumbai... at the end i think Delhi Bangalore and punjab are gonna go through...,1
It's high...smh,2
Victory Over incoming,3
"Bruh the umpiring, what the actual fuck.",2
Don't trust the umpires lol,8
I want to kill this fuckface umpire ü§¨,1

Kohli is seriously such a cunt in the IPL. No other word describes him better.,9
kohli you fuckin retard,5
It was too high and inside edge?,3

Looked plumb,1
RCB need to all out here for any chance to win.,3
Looked Plumb,2
"Last year commentators were told to peddle the Tata Harrier but I don't see it filling up the streets   
This year its the Altroz.  
  
I think the MBAs which occupy positions at the Tata Administrative Services need to be given some real work",6
too high may be?,1
High?,1
Not out,2
Are we gonna qualify?,1
Exact same way Sehwag used to get out man those flashbacks,6

HOW IS THAT A NICK FUCKING DUCKING FNJDKDISKSJSHSUSUISS,6
Fair decision.,3
UMPIRE'S CALL?,1
I could see Holder‚Äôs six replaying in Kohli‚Äôs mind before taking that review.. the dread and fear in his eyes,6
Ugh! Fucking spike!!!,1
thats tuff,1
Maybe I have treated you too harshly ump,3
Umpire redemption arc?,5
"Why is he saying ""the call is Naaaat out""",6
Umpire's Thicc Indian accent got me,2
Looks plumb but holder is too tall,3
looks plumb and in line :(,2
Umpire pulled a Tewatia. Good decision,5
"Umpire apology thread, lol",7
Would've been umpires call even without the spike,2
Umpires call would freak the heck out of Koach,5
Wtf umpire has super sonic ears,9
No fucking way the umpire saw the edge. He was taking a chance,8
Accidental correct decision from the clueless umpire,9
Actually great decision from umpire . Thought Holder completely missed it,4
C'mon Holder trash that stupid car!,4
For once,1
Srh defending 160>> chasing 120,2
"Tall guy, jumping up, hit on knee roll, that was over the stumps for sure. Horrible review",2
I bet the on-field Umpire didn't even knew he nicked the ball.,9
The gods shit on rcb and Delhi lmao,1
"Finally, a good umpiring decision",3
Stop fucking bowling short,2
"Oh ffs, that was plumb. Tiniest of edges saved him",2
being blind gave the umpire superhearing lmao,5
Holder‚Äôs long levers coming into play,1
Umpire like phew I was actually right,6
Fuck,2
Big Boy doesn't trust anyone else to finish this game,2
Only if SRH could chase like how RR did...,1
Chad Paschim > Virgin Ananta,3
Fucked our run rate too. Thank you,2
Virgin srh batsmen vs chad Jason holder.,3
Bc holder,1
"Before the review SRH fans be like, ""Gote muh mein aa gaye the""",4
"Why would you bowl Saini what the fuck lmao not only is it a release of pressure, but he is bound to fuck the NRR up as well",2
"Nope, the on field umpires did not detect that inside edge. That was a fluke.",3
Gn frends. Our shitshow continues. üò™,6
Tollder,1
"SRH fans : we are gonna bottle this

Holder : I'm gonna dump those bottles out of the park",4
"Holder boy you sure can hit sixes, but let's play a bit safe",4
Effortless from big Jason,4
Well guess Chahal cannot bowl his last over,1
Holder dealing in sixes here.,1
What's Anjum saying,1
Long levers,1
How the fuck do you not bowl Chahal Washi back to back here lmaooooo,3
What a BIG DICK shot by love machine Holder‚ù§Ô∏èüí¶,4
Every team needs a West Indian to calm the nerves I suppose,8
holder created his own super sixes competition here.,3
Natural game,2
Again big mistake to not bowl Chahal's last over,3
Jason Holder to be christened and Jason Tewatia.,3
THAT'S NOT THE ALTROZ,1
Chahal still has an over left...,2
"That looked plumb in real time. 

No way on field umpire heard that faint edge in real time. 

Below par umpiring.",0
"The bloke's like 12 ft tall, him getting hit on the knee roll is like hitting any other batsman on the shoulder",1
Oh come on,2
Holders pads as tall as the stumps,6
Holder is such a good pick! Making sure there are no jitters in the chase.,1
"Saini is so shit
Even that 19 year old tyagi is better than him.",0
"You cant be out if you hit it for 6

*taps forehead*",2
HaarCB reverting to type with nonsensical featureless pace bowling.,1
Kohli please bring siraj back so srh can finish this quickly.,3
Rcb giving false hopes and then making a mess,3
To think this guy went unsold initially while guys like Chris Green and Neesham went for high price,2
Game killing 6.,3
"Holder Holder

Meethi baatein bolkar",3
Umpire is the real life daredevil,4
Brek that car less go,1

Short balls to holder are in the slot,2

Most sixes hiting that shitty altroz award",9
Holder to everyone- kaisa laga mera majak,5
Aaaand RCB will remain second on the table for now.  Not that it matters,7
What happens if they win within 14.3 overs?,3
Why is Saini bowling?,1
"Stop fucking our NRR, Holder!",3
"Forgive me, but Saini has a very punchable face",0
Fuck SRH. They make sure to fuck us. Now they fuck our NRR too,1
This over could cost RCB the IPL,2
Saini is just 5 iq points higher than Umesh,5
Kohli you fucking retard why would you take Chahal off,6
And that's the game,3
RCB/DC getting knocked out,0
Moron Saini not even bothering to bowl slow.,2
"Everybody else changing their pace and bowling slower balls

Saini : Watch me bowl fast and get fucked.",3
"Chahal has 1 over left, Washy has 1 left. And Koach gives Saini the ball... Rubbish captaincy!",6
How tall is Holder?,2
"Thank God, we have one west indian whose flicks can travel",3
Holder is so tall the normal bouncers some to knee & hittable height,4
"I'm back to being a proper RCB fan, CSK and MI please destroy your opponents.",5
Should have given Chahal :),3
Why didn‚Äôt Kohli bowl Chahal? Match is done and dusted now basically.,3
a west indian finishing games for srh? what is this 2014?,11
Keep bowling 135+ you idiot.,2
Arre yrr mc,1
ultra edge fixing,1
"Fuck it, bowl fast and get hammered",6
Holder is thinking about the run rate right?,7
Klassic Koach. Should've brought Chahal.,11
Holder to RCB : Hold my thong.,1
Fyea,1
Wish Kohli had 1 more over of an world class spinner left in this slow pitch,6
I do not understand why Kohli would bowl Saini right now? What is the LOGIC?,6
"If there's Jadhav spirit in Abhishek Sharma, there's Umesh Yadav spirit in every RCB bowler.",2
Holder let me kiss you my man,2
Holder is so tall that it misses the stumps most of the time when it hits his knee roll.,3
Saini is a world class bowler but not right for this pitch. He just gives extra pace so it‚Äôs easier for batsmen to hit,3
"RCB ü§ù DC

Fight for who plays worse on Monday bois",10
Holder provides so much stability to the lower middle order. Very good add üëç,6

Kohli has been really mediocre this IPL both as batsman and captain,8
RCB joining Bairstow wondering why Holder isn't in New Zealand with the WI preparing for the series there.,6
Why did he give it to Saini? Pace wasnt needed!!! Could have bowled Gurkeerat ffs,5
"Am I the only one who wants to slap the shit outta the RCB bowlers for bowling short? Like idiots, SRH didn't bowl 1 short ball. Fucken learn.",9
"RCB could have easily pulled this off. Got the selection wrong, didn't play the selected bowlers in their proper role either.",3
"Holder 

Hold my beer, gonna smack a few toward cow corner",4
It looks like they don't want NRR.,3
guys how does holder dig yorkers for his height!!!,2
Should have bowled chahal and washi.  Braindead koach.,8
[removed],6
Is saini dense or something? Why is he tryna bowl faster and faster.,3
Caribbean men are T20 gods,6
This last round of games is going to be ridiculously fun tbh,5
Saini should have been a net bowler in Australia. Another excellent selection decision,6
Why do we bowl so many wides? It's not just this season.,4
Why not bowl Chahal and Sundar and try to get Holder out? Why to feed him pace?,3
Holder you baddie.,3
14.4 is back in game,2
"I sometimes don't understand the auction. 

Holder was unsold in the auction. 

Not saying that he is a great T20 player, but having him as an extra is always a positive for any team.",3
Finish it before 14.3 Holder!!,1
"Phew!!  Finally, WE win. By WE, I mean any team playing against RCB.",3
Mhahaha,2
Holder has a Test century but I didn't know he can hit big.,2
Mann almost rcb,2
Why was Chahal not given this over instead of Saini,6
I've come to peace with the fact that RCB will never win IPL in my lifetime,8
Saini wasn't the right person to bowl this over IMO,6
Brain dead not to give over to Chahal when there was pressure..,4
How many more balls so we can stay ahead of KXIP?,3
"If rcb looses this over, they go below punjab",10
Damn holder is playing the role he is supposed to.,5

Koach : alright bois, time to fuck up",7
"Can Russell, I say can he finally play tomorrow just like holder is doing for srh?!",1
"Acc to my calculations, if they chase it in 14.3 won‚Äôt the NRR be changed by 2.4 but that doesn‚Äôt seem right, how tf do you calculate NRR, someone help",2
Chahal saved for final over by brilliant galactus mastermind,5
Can't believe csk player is in super striker list.,2
"can any legend please calculate 

By how much Runs or over does kkr have to win by tommorrow to have a better NRR than both RCB and DC, because that almost perfectly fixes our spot in playoffs,

After the match",0
"IMPORTANT: If RCB take this game beyond 14.3 overs, they will still have a better net run rate than KXIP

LOOKS UNLIKELY NOW. Could have been possible with Chahal  but :)",5
Do they know about this 14.3 overs thing?,4
Kohli making fuckall decisions and then blaming umpires. Ah the old classic,7
"Take it deep, save the NRR",3
"Tbh the way RCB are playing, they don't deserve to be in playoffs. But other 6 teams except MI are equally shit.",5
My God what utterly brainless bowling.,3
THANK YOU SAINI YOU FUCKING IDIOT LMAO,16
Does this mean that whoever loses from dc vs rcb will not make in playoffs,2
Hit that fucking car,1
Thank fuck we are doing thissssssss,1
"Fuck you Koach, our NRR is fucked.",6
Holder is my MoM. Wbu guys?,1

Srh : NRR DESTROYERS,7

What the hell how are these shots going for sixes. Stadium is to tiny lol,5
"If they score 7 runs in 5 balls, KXIP get a better NRR than RCB",2
Saini or umesh cant say,1
Come on Holder finish this quickly!,1
**14.4**,1
Hahaha altroz getting smashed today,1
This IPL is a good indicator that Kohli's captaincy is shit. I hope BCCI hand over the reigns to Rohit Sharma. He deserves the captaincy in LOIs,10
Holder is doing a better job for SRH than Maxwell has done all season for KXIP.,5
Holder really hates that car,1
A guided six. RCB will have a poor RR at the end of the match.,1
Universe Boss Holder,3
Wew,2
Saini going the Umesh Yadav way,2
Thank you Saini and Kohli for all the pace on the ball,6
Saini finishing off the game for RCB in style,3
They're really going after the Altroz today,2
"What does Cricbuzz mean by ""If RCB take this beyond 14.3 they will have better net run rate than KXIP? Is this calculation including the remaining match of both teams?",3
Too easy with Saini's pace,2
Bring it to at least 14.3 dammit for the NRR,1
"That ""we are 15-20 runs short"" interview coming up after the break",3
Yes let's take our best bowler off when they need less than run a ball and give them pace on the bat on a slow pitch with small boundaries to a guy who's twice the size of tha bowler what could go wrong,7
"Saini ahahhahaha

Pace is pace yaar is kill",2
"Why wasn't Chahal bowled, WHAT THE FUCK KOHLI COME THE FUCK ON",5
It was a deflection ...nothing more..pace and dew carrying it away,3
Mumbai gonna make sure srh makes the playoff wont they?,4

Srh batsmen eyeing altroz... Srh become overnight fan fav now,3
They knew the match would get over way too early so they made us watch Yuzvendra Chahal‚Äôs hand for a couple of minutes,5

Chahal had an over left and they bowled Saini? Lmao,6
"Been batting for Abhishek's inclusion in every match. He's good.

EDIT: WTF Abhishek",2
59m? Seriously?,2
Safest car in india is not safe,3
It's good for us if SRH finish before 14th over right?,3
Pls bowl faster and shorter. Great idea mate,6
"The fuck how was that 6, I thought he made a grounded shot

I was trying to find the crawling ball on the ground while it was cruising",4
DON'T BOWL SHORT WOW YOU ABSOLUTE SHITBRAIN,4
Does Saini know any other ball than fast,7
NRR got fucked for RCB,3
Too late cunts,2
Sunny G losing it lol.,4
Lol why would Kohli not give to Chahal? Is he thinking he can take it to the last over or something,3
What's this 14.3 over thing ??,2
"Good fkr kohli to save chahal for end...brilliant, excellent quality leadership and a chutiya",5

Why not Yuzi,3
Holder going for the kill,4
"Now everything going kxip way today

Cant wait for them to bottle it against CSK tommorrow",7
Surely not?,5
Negative IQ move by Kohli to play a 140kph+ bowler to ensure that SRH batsman don't struggle with timing on the slow pitch,17
No way RCB gonna win the match against DC. RCB is out of the torny,2
Rookie going for glory shot... chill mate,4
Can SRH still KOHL-apse?,6
ahahahahahaaa! Beamer Saini IQ is in the negative zone.,8
Holder finished it.,2
7(4) required for KXIP chances. Can Holder hit a six and run a single?,3
"That‚Äôs a whatever wicket. Liked the intent. Poor execution

Move on and win the game",6
Kohli' brain dead captaincy will cost us another series. Taking spinners off and saving them for what? FFS,7
Good car. Shitty marketing.,7
He played well tbh. Pandey played a 15(30) in a similar situation,6
"Wow, Holder and Abshike bringing Kings XI, Rajestan and KKR back",6
Saini legit has become such a garbage bowler I can't even,2
i would love to see RR qualifying. don't know if it's possible but they seem to be the only side that can halt MI at the moment,4
"Why are RCB worried about staying above kxip NRR? If Kxip win tomorrow, we go up either way due to nrr being too close. If we lose, it's game over for us either way 

RCB chance will depend entirely on DC match.",9
"RCB : *you gonna win this*

SRH : *NO U*",11
This is exactly what SRH want. Pace on the ball. The few sixes they've hit have all come off fast bowlers. Why tf is Kolhi persisting with pace when Chahal has done so well? I swear Koach's decisions as a captain has been absolutely terrible in the last 3 seasons.,7
"Woah this make a rcb and dc more entertaining, since both their nrr r shit now",3
Currently betting on us still losing. One wicket down after I placed my bet. Can't wait to win this.,0
A fucking hattrick would be useless now,3
How has Saini been this season? Cant really remember a motm performance,0
Holder might just be the finisher SRH have been desperately crying out for years.,7
FOR GOD‚Äôs SAKE PROTECT THE NET RUN RATE,7
Can anybody choke this,1
This is what I have against Priyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma. No responsibility shown.,0
Don't shit on Abhi guys. He was going after nrr,4
"Should SRH win by 14.2 or 14.3?

"CHAHAL HAD ONE OVER REMAINING, NOW PUT THAT OVER UP YOUR ASS KOACH",14

Csk winning tomorrow,5
So Holder is the finisher SRH has been looking for!,8
"3 balls, 6 runs

EZ",5
Yuzi Hattrick incoming?,1
Has Chahal got overs left?,2
Guess it's safe for us now.,5
Surely srh can't collapse now right?,3

RRR at 1. Still not done guys,2

"Honestly, fuck SRH for such irresponsible shots. Pandey should've stayed back and made sure the team got over the line, now that he's a part of the national team as well.",2

"What a boring day of cricket

Hopefully we get a one sided win for KXIP followed by a double super over between KKR and RR tomorrow",2
This match has been an unnecessary rollercoaster,5
I have little trust in srh batting but I think we got the win this time boys,4
Giving saini the ball was brain dead when NRR is at stake here,5
Holder: I will do it myself,7

Yessssssss,2
Lmao rcb,2
Yeah let's go risers!!!,5
Rip RCB run rate,5
Holder is such underrated,3
I really hope whoever conducts the post match interview with Kohli asks him straight up about why he didn't bowl Chahal over Saini,9
"5 runs or 5 wickets for SRH? Nah 5 runs is a tad too much, my bets on 5 wickets",4
Holder CHAD,7
A Chahal hat-trick can do something for RCB,3
Chalo RCB ko vanakkam,7

I dont understand why fans are hung up on 14.3?",5
Haha Holder,2
Whats the point if your two best bowlers dont even bowl their qouta in this kind of match. ffs,6
And he did it! Hahaha!,1
Finally the torture has come to an end,5

Thanks for the nrr RCB. Very cool.,4
THAT is the treatment Chahal deserved. Love you Jason!,3
At least we took MI to 14.2 overs with 10 less runs to play with. Did I said against MI's power house batting,6
"RCB, standing over a crawling DC: You may think we are different. You may think you choke better. But we are the same you and I.

You have misfiring batsmen, so do we. Your bowlers love to give, so do ours. You dissappoint your fans, we're the meme team bitch. So don't go around stealing our thunder, don't go around stealing what's rightfully ours. WE ARE THE MEME.",17

Holy shit 0.01 difference in NRR for RCB and DC now..,10
Thanks RCB  fans for supporting us !! We will come back strong next year - Virat kohli on monday.,13
Yep! 20 runs short per Koach :),2
Fuck probability shit.. rcb better lose next game and go home cunts.,11

Kohli - We WeRE 20 rUnS ShOrt,10

Kohli seems so happy. So am I,8
"He thought 120 would be a good total

We somehow sneak into the 4th place,15
Siraj sucks so bad in T20s,4
RCB NRR below Punjab :(,4
RCB overhyping Sharjah pitch. This is a 180-190 ground. Nothing less,5
Warner chose to chase even after that kxip debacle. Turned out to be a master stroke,12
Is rcb nrr worse than dc now?,2

The team bowling first is gonna win for the rest of the IPL now. Toss is gonna decide the champions. Shame,5
"KXIP (-0.133) now has a higher NRR than RCB (-0.145) and DC (-0.159), and has a good shot to beat the loser of the next match if KXIP can get to 14 points.

"Both RCB and DD will qualify regardless if Mumbai beat SRH or Punjab lose tomorrow, any of them will do",2

What's the status of the table now? Are we making it or not?,2
Sun is rising again for SRH. One more hurdle.,7
Thanks srh and mi now if kxip wins they are definitely going to the playoffs since both the winner of rr vs kkr and loser of dc vs rcb will have worse nrr.,5
Boring matchday,5
"""We thought 140 would've been a good total...""

Keep dreaming Kohli",11
It's been freaking while since we broke into Top 4,10
Oof Kohli with that dc vs rcb shade,2
I'm glad they brought in Holder and he performed almost immediately in the team.,9
Kohli is definitely not a captain material & I just get goose bumps thinking about he is captain of India.,5
How are we still 2nd? This is a disgrace,10
Eesaaala RCB?,10
DC-RCB bhai bhai,17
Saini really tried to bounce out Holder huh,9
"Dear MI management,

You were fantastic till now and your spot at the top of the table is guaranteed. This has been a long tournament and most of your reserve players spent almost 3 months in the bio-bubble which took a toll on their mental health. It's only fair that they get a chance for the inconsequential game. Moreover, it is prudent to rest key players since the turnaround time between your last league match and Qualifier-1 is just 48 hours. So I suggest you field this team against SRH:

1. AnmolPreet Singh
2. Aditya Tare
3. Sourabh Tripathi
4. Prince Balwant Rai
5. Sherfane Rutherford
6. Ankul Roy
7. Mohsin Khan
8. Jayant Yadav
9. Dhawal Kulkarni
10. Digvijay Deshmukh
11. James Pattinson

Sincerely,

SRH Fan.",45
"Yup 20 runs short

Everyone anticipated that",6
"you‚Äôre welcome KXIP, all you need to do is win and you‚Äôre in playoffs unless RR/KKR pull off a miracle and overtake you in NRR",7
CSK bros you have nothing to gain. Please let us win. I'll join the Thala cult with you,16
Kohli doesn‚Äôt even look sad lmao,9
So now two of the most shittiest teams recently will have the 2nd spot. Kinda undeserving but hey who's complaining.,8
"RCB: -0.145

DC: -0.159

Final & only match against each other. Real chance only 1 going in playoffs.",7
"So you are saying we need to beat RCB to secure top 2 spot.

Not gonna happen, just watch our last 3 matches.",6
"Can someone list out the wrong decisions made by kohli this year? 

Yea i dont have a whole millennium to jot down every single one of them either",8

DC -0.16

This team should never bat first.,2

Let‚Äôs go csk,6
"Holder was nonchalantly hitting sixes. I cant believe he was not even picked by any teams during auction. Really under rated cricketer. 

With this defeat RCB could miss play offs if they lose to DC. DC is in similar boat. I hope KXIP and SRH win their final game. Even a teams like KKR/RR could win huge and make up but that looks tough.",10
"Bring it on monday, classic rcb vs Delhi daredevils.",8
Tf is wrong with RCB all of a sudden,4
RCB calculators will be in full flow after tomorrow's results. I hope they don't have any South Africans doing that match ;),6
While we are amazed at the teams that win all their remaining matches to qualify we should not ignore the part played by teams like delhi and bangalore who also lose all their remaining matches to make this happen.,7
"Tbh, if we can't end our losing streak before the playoffs, we don't deserve to be there",10
"Fair to say that the result of last league game, MI v SRH will decide at least two spots?",5
"I just don‚Äôt understand RCB‚Äôs logic in the auction. Yes, Morris is a great buy but they do anything to address the problems in the batting. Finch has always been shit in IPL and they spent 4.5cr to bring this bum to his 8th franchise. They didn‚Äôt want Parthiv to play, but yet they didn‚Äôt invest in an Indian wicketkeeper. They released Stoinis but didn‚Äôt buy a proper finisher. They are basically heading into every game with 4 players who can bat. Gurkeerat is useless and Dube is a flop. They should have played Moeen Ali to shore up the batting and give some solidity to the middle order. Right now the only player in this side who can play at 200 strike rate is ABD and we‚Äôre all seeing what happens when he doesn‚Äôt fire. This team needs two lower order batsmen, a quality opener and a world class express bowler like Starc",20

DC and RCB competing in who deserves not to qualify more.,9
So much dew.. spinners gets the best results.,2
Gonna need a calculator out for the next match day,5
Koach's mind games not working now.... He's definitely not thinking that 140 was a par score,9

KKR - L W W L W W L L W L W L L

CSK - W L L L W L L W L L L W W

Other than MI, the three teams in the top 4 have suffered badly in the 2nd half of the season. And KXIP, SRH and RR are having a late surge to stay alive, even CSK have won 2 in a row but it is too late for them. The tournament took a total U turn at the end of league stage.",8
Thanks RCB for sharing some embarrassment with DC. True brosü§ù,10
"If Kxip win tomorrow, they're in?

Their NRR isn't that high compared to RCB/DC..",5
Aus could have a great limited-overs captain in Warner but they shoot themselves in the foot.,7
If Punjab and KKR win with better NRR then RCB vs DC loser will be knocked out. Wtf.,3
Man can't believe KKR is in 7th place. If CSK wins tomorrow then they'll be last LMAO,13

Only chance of RCB going into Playoffs is by winning next Game",8
"So two meme teams now fight for the 2nd spot, lmaooo who would've thought it would come to this.",10

Its becoming monotonous to blame dew by losing team.,11
"The hype was surrounding KKR vs. KXIP for 4th spot but if SRH didn't choke vs. KXIP, Kings would've been 7th rn. 

Now, if they win tmrw, they're 2nd. SRH/RCB/DC would've been fighting for 3rd & 4th spot as would KKR and RR for 4th.",4
That Punjab choke is the best things that‚Äôs happened to SRH for this year and next. They needed to play an overseas rounder over 3 top 4 batsman.,15
"Really want to see MI RCB SRH KXIP. All that needs to happen is KXIP win tommorow and RCB beat DC, SRH beat MI.",9

Rajasthans out of the tournament right,0
It would be funny if SRH doesn't make it to the playoffs even with such a High NRR and 3 teams with negative NRR get through.,18
"After the shit season we had, I'm just happy our fate is now completely in our hands.",24

I expect nothing and I am still let down.,44
To come off that depressing loss against Punjab and winning 2 games comprehensively is a commendable task. Let's go boys. We can win against MI,26
Just hoping rr qualifies because they‚Äôre the only team that can defeat Mumbai,7

Tomorrow: 

1. KXIP to lose to CSK, even if last ball. They will be out.
2. We MUST win vs. RR, else we are out. Preferably win by a good margin to increase horrible NRR.

RR & KXIP officially out. Now we fight with (loser of tomorrow) & SRH for 4th spot.   

Monday:

1. DC vs. RCB, either to shit bed (likely DC given streak, but RCB can surprise), preferably by a good margin. 

Tuesday: 

1. SRH to lose to¬†MI really bad to bring down RR (whatever helps, helps us worst case scenario. Thanks a ton Mohammad Syringe u nasty rat). 

Outcome: 

1. We make top 4 likely to loser of RCB vs. SRH and if we beat RR healthily (tough but better we chase than they do because they're set very well chasing, no?). 
2. Would be great to see DC shit so hard they don't qualify after chilling in Top 3 for well over half the season. Would be absolute memes if RCB are knocked out. Win-win!",12

"I am an RCB fan as you can see from my flair and yes, I am hurt by today's loss against SRH. We were simply incompetent. But this is not about RCB or their loss. 

This is about Anjum Chopra. How the hell is she sitting up there in that commentary box?? 

Absolutely out of context commentary when she has nothing to say, adds no value, often states the obvious and makes obvious grammatical errors (Hint : ""Womens"").

To top it all, her voice is so damn irritating. She continues to blabber her nonsensical shit the entire match and makes the experience worse when your favourite team's loosing. 

Easily the worst commentator I've heard this IPL season. 

Spare us of your nonsense and go home, please, Mother Anjum",23
"I love how every team's fans (apart from MI and CSK obviously) have their own little permutations and combinations going at this stage in order to find out how their team can enter the playoffs. 4 matches, 6 teams, 3 spots, it all comes down to this over the next 3 days.

"Ok so I'm a **DC** fan and I need the following to happen:

CSK v KXIP: CSK has to thrash KXIP considering DC's low NRR and horrible streak(upon which even Monday's game looks difficult due to the openers' struggle)

RR v KKR: Doesn't matter who wins, but the match has to be very very close so that their NRR doesn't change much.

DC v RCB: Now if DC wins this, idc about Tuesday's MI v SRH. But if we lose, MI has to THRASH TF OUT OF SRH for DC to make it.

Also, I think it'd be better to give Stoinis a chance to open, as there's nothing to lose anyway considering how terrible Shaw, Rahane and Dhawan(after the centuries) are performing.",10

Just hope whoever bats first set target of around 160 so we might get Russell/Morgan opening if Russell is fit or Buttler/Stokes. I badly want to see a game similar to MI vs RR 2014",17

"Don't know which team to support today, both their fans (loyal ones) have been through some tough shit for so long.
