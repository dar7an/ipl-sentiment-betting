I think a lot of these fuckups are to do with Baz and David Hussey ""as well"", but DK seems like the convenient target. You look at Baz/Hussey interviews and you get the feel that they have huge say on stuff like batting order. 

I mean, after all Baz opened with Narine in the CPL, so there's a good chance that he might be advocating for the same in the IPL.

Dhoni's batting has been very poor this season and also his captaining is questionable. Fans are quick to blame jadhav now but he had to come in because of dhoni. It was Dhoni's decision to sent him over bravo.,26
2020-10-07T18:25:45+00:00,singhsrb,"More than anything, this season should serve as a reminder that either you consider: 

 - A) a captain is as good as his team and we should probably not give Dhoni exclusive credit for the trophies.

 - B) Or, Captain is responsible for everything , and therefore, also takes blame for shit performances.

There are too many people here who selectively believe A or B to keep the blame off Dhoni!",42
