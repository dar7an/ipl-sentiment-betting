"Pretty sure KKR have zero chance of winning today. But hey, it's not winning that matters, it's the participation that counts.",6
"If we lose today, I call dibs on posting the sadness thread.",24
Please open with Gill and Tripathi today.,14
Jadhav and Dhoni partnership a key for KKRs victory.,56
"In b4 Kedhar Jadhav himself starts a ""Personal Apology"" thread on r/cricket for playing this match",4
"If Kedhar does not do something useful this match, he will only have himself to blame.",1
"*Announcement* : Guys few of us have written and E-mailed to Star Sports team for tonning down on Dhoni Ass kissing in their 90 Min Pre-show. Apparantly they have replied and said "" It's upto to producers & VT team, but we will look into it"". Please Watch today's Pre-Show and let us know if there is any shift from their usual "" Thala Dhoni"" "" Lion will Roar"" shenanigans. 👍",6
Curious to see if KKR would persist with Narine opening again,2
"Ideally, this would have been the match, our bowlers continued their upward trajectory. But I think Gill and Russell will have other ideas.",1

Welcome to the Thala sux circlejerk thread!,8
"RCB boys, I bought a new book from the stationary today. Let the season of mind bending calculations begin. 🤗 Btw who should win and by what margin today?",2
How many of you remember KKR Vs CSK @ Eden Gardens in 2012. Where CSK needed 5 of 1 and Bravo smacked a full toss for a six at deep mid-wicket,13
I want a complete one-sided match so that SRH can be pushed up. That’s how we came to 6th from 7th and that’s the only way,2
My prediction batting first team will win the game,5
Watson and Faf will determine this game for CSK. I don't think the domestic Indian batsmen will be able to handle the KKR fast bowling.,1
I feel like the CSK middle order will come good today. Mighty Thala gonna troll our collective asses for doubting their chances.,1
"30 Min in and this is 3rd video of series "" Will Thala dhoni Roar again?"". Man at 39 Sachin had less expectations.",3
Pls give me some Banton to watch tonight KKR,4
Thala sucking off Thala like Indian media channels suck off mudiji,0
Pat Cummins' form decides the outcome.,5
I just wanna see dk and murali Vijay looking at each other with serious looks😂,12
"Dinesh Karthik as batsman: 30 (23), 0 (3), 1 (3), 6 (8) 

As captain: Trying every possible combination with the team's batting order. Sending himself before Morgan.

Can't be dropped because he is the captain. 

Press F.",6
Will DK and Vijay fist bump after the match...that's what I wanna know,9
"Hi folks, I generally don't do this, but here's a bit -- What's your opinion on Sunny's story on [ this r/cricket thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j6or8p/heres_a_bit_from_sunny_days_where_gavaskar) today?",1
"Me: This should be a thriller match. Tense, CSK winning, winning six by Dhoni. Aww!

Also me: Dhoni suxx. I dont want to see another Jadhav-Dhoni duet. Spare me!",3
"DK and MSD, both have underperformed in this IPL. It's hard to choose one for the dream 11 team.",1
This match will be unique because both captains are being asked to consider Gambhiring themselves,2

RCB should get Suresh Raina next year.,2
"I can't see CSK defeating KKR, sorry",2
"Taking 26 wickets, Imran Tahir was the highest wicket taker last IPL season. 

He was the third highest wicket taker (15) in the recent CPL which clearly shows he isn't out of form.

What's keeping him out of the playing-XI?",6
I'm sure Andre Russell will want to know Piyush Chawla's exact diet and fitness regimen that he has adopted over the last year.,3
Boys are we ready to meme dk into performing??,23
[removed],-6
Imagine being Brian Lara and have to praise Dhoni for 21 straight days. Tells you how after retirement cricketers life is not easy in carribian😂😭,5
Make. Tripathi. Open. Instead. Of. Narine. Also. Promote. Morgan. Up. The. Order.,1
Ffs CSK chase again,1
Love DK's new look. Hope that changes the fortune too.,5
"I've not started watching yet, but I can presume that the amount of times dhoni is mentioned in non-csk matches, today there'll be dhoni in each sentence",3
"Holy fuck DK without a beard, looks so different.",5
"CSK chasing.

Easy win for KKR.",6
Bruh DK,2
"Without a full beard, DK is an imposter.",1
Will we ever bat first or nah?,1
Fucking hell CSK are always losing the toss this year,2
">Narine opens

Bruh",2
Rajma Chawla dropped,5
Nice to see the Curran brothers playing for CSK today,5
"OK. KKR is doing one thing right at least today. Winning the toss and batting.

Let's see if we who comes out to open the batting.",1
Kohli winning some tosses and Dhoni losing thrice in a row. <Insert 2020>,5

CSK are gonna struggle to chase on this used pitch unfortunately,1

Aerodynamic DK,1
for a moment DK looked like that anchor Jatin Sapru lmao,3
"I feel csk will struggle a bit today. 

1. They are batting 4th on the same pitch used for both yesterday and today.
2. Havent seen much dew in abu dhabi. 
3. The ground dimensions are bigger so more running is needed and boundaries harder to come by. 
4. Batting second if opener gets out early i dont think middle order can sustain.",2
KKR chose to win!,1
Jadhav still in the 11. What does he contribute to the team?,4
"Karn Sharma for chawla .

What a change lol.

Why the fuck they can't try Kishore.",0
Hope Karn bowls better than Chawla,1
"DK is such a likeable guy, no wonder even after being cheated by his wife he still got to marry one of the cutest athletes in india ❤️🥰",13
Can we not do better than DK as a captain :(,-1
What does Narine have to do to get dropped? Just wanna watch Banton :'(,2
People were saying Patt Cummins is getting paid 1 crore for each match he plays. Karn Sharma is getting paid 5 crores for one match each year.,72
Karn Sharma selected- This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 runs,13
"I just realised....

**Bois today is dk's day, murli vijay is in the opposite dugout**",15
CSK is chasing.. sigh😒,4
"If Narine opens, in supporting csk",2
We made a change after winning ? Wtf,3
[KKR last opted to bat first in 2015](https://twitter.com/deeputalks/status/1313834867558236161?s=21),14
"If narine is going to do well against any team it's csk, no real express pace bowler that can bounce him out. If he fails here he needs to either move down the order or get dropped. 

Do kkr have an indian opener that can replace him?",5
I'd be stoked if KKR pulls it off!,9
Whatsup with Chennai players and nipple pokies!,3
Guess Dhoni used up all the toss luck to the early part of his career.,14
I am getting heavy rps 2016 vibes  from this csk.,14
[deleted],-23
"I think they'll go with Narine on the top, one last time today and it will work somehow which obviously would be a disaster for KKR in the games to come.",4
My tamil friend called me a chamatu  (spelling? ) today. Was he taking the piss?,4
Surprise that CSK made a change but KKR didn't,3
 All the best Knights 💜,2
Could have used kuldeep to boost his confidence,0
"Morgan is a fucking madlad he should come in at 4 no questions asked, guy smashed Rabada like he was some gully bowler",2
You know you have screwed up badly when Dhoni replaces you with another player in the team.,5
I don't know why but I keep forgetting that KKR won multiple IPL championships,21
KKR has actually a brilliant xi like MI and DC. They don't have many gaps. The just need to be more consistent. The captaincy is a bit surprising.,6
Been raining all day feels like I'm in Manchester again,1
supporting kkr today!,3
Our management is braindead as fuck. They are gonna open with Narine once again and we are gonna be 5/1 by the end of 2 overs once again.,5
Chonker replaces Chonker,3
Really expecting a Karn Sharma masterclass/disasterclass today. Nothing in between.,2
Chawla dropped against his old team. Maybe Russell feasted on him in training all those years.,3
Come on. Let's see another Faf and Watto show.,5
No Banton. Boorrriiinngg,3
"> Trivia - The last time before today KKR opted to bat first after winning toss was in May 2015 - 69 matches ago.

From Cricbuzz. What the fuck?",99
All I want to see is CSK and MI lose.,10
"Anyone think that KKR will open with Tripathi and Narine and bat Gill at 7?

At this stage it honestly wouldn’t surprise me.",3
Kuldeep went from the most exciting new talent in India to a non-regular in ipl. Meanwhile Chahal is going from strength to strength even when he had to bowl at Chinnaswamy most of his career. Shows how important mental toughness is at the top level.,15
"Unless Kuldeep has forgotten how to roll his arm over, he should get a game, at least in games not in Sharjah",1
Why would KKR buy Banton with established pros like Alex Hales and Evin Lewis available at base price,0
Keep calm and  ~~trust MSD~~  pray to god!!,8
"|Rabada- 4.2 Crore|
|Karn Sharma- 5 Crore|
Makes you think",6
I am here just to see them lose...,2
"On paper KKR are stronger than CSK. However with Karthik being not a good captain and Dhoni being a better captain ,CSK have a better chance of winning the match. If CSK wins , they enter the top 4",4
"BC Imran Tahir might get injured bringing drinks, play him asap.",6
LMFAO picking the WK for your Dream11 team is the most boring choice today. Thala or DK?,4

"Karn Sharma gives CSK's bowling attack additional weight. That's good, isn't it?",2
"Imran Tahir only runs & carries the drinks, because it reminds him of his wicket celebration",5
"I noticed something over the past few days, especially after KKR's loss versus Delhi. 

McCullum is being credited for everything good and DK is being shit on for everything bad. 

I feel for DK tbh, I've been impressed with the way he's handled the bowlers, although I agree that some decisions have been braindead. But does DK have full power? I doubt it. I think a lot of these fuckups are to do with Baz and David Hussey ""as well"", but DK seems like the convenient target. You look at Baz/Hussey interviews and you get the feel that they have huge say on stuff like batting order. 

I mean, after all Baz opened with Narine in the CPL, so there's a good chance that he might be advocating for the same in the IPL. 

I think there's serious tension and conflict within the setup and it's kinda reflecting on the field.",62
[deleted],7
Amazing how under the radar has Faf been despite having such a stellar season so far.,1
Lmao was Dhoni bowling?,2
[deleted],-1
Wtf that doesn’t look like dk,1
Chawla spoke so much about this contest Vs his former team [here](https://youtu.be/NXxbui-kqzA)  only to be replaced eh???,3
Looking at these teams you see how OP MI and DC are with their bowlers.,6
"So Nehra not even trying hide anything.

Dhoni's CSK and King Khan KKR

Will he say in another match Ambani's Mumbai Indians?",5
Dhoni should’ve played M Vijay for the psychological advantage smh,27
Will Chennai ever bat first this year?,7
TRIPATHI!!!! LESSGOOOO,6
"Yeahhhhhhh, RAHUL TRIPATHI",6
And its TRIPATHI. Yay!!!,5
finally some sense in the KKR management,7
Thank you!!!!!,3
Finally a change of openers by KKR,4
Happy Birthday DJ Bravo. Turning 37 today,8
">Trivia - The last time before today KKR opted to bat first after winning toss was in May 2015 - 69 matches ago.

That's some stat. But understandable bringing Eden Gardens into consideration.",9
"""This is the 33rd toss KKR have won since they last chose to bat first back in May 2015"" source: cricinfo",7
Tripathi finally,3
Tripathi opening gives me hope that Morgan will come at 4,2
"Tripathi, my man, please don't let r/cricket down!",5
Csk is being chasing in all the matches in ipl 2020 until now...,3
"Rejoice my Brethren, our wish has been granted.",4
"Dint Expect Piyush to get dropped outta nowhere. CSK changing team for no reason is shocking. 

Bad for me as Chawla was my constant in Fantasy, as he's cheap and gave decent points.",2
Specialist fielder Jadhav is underrated,2
"Why isn't Vijay playing tonight?
Would have been fun ಠ_ಠ",1
Do csk basically bat till 11 ..,2
Karn Sharma must be the least well-known cricketer to play all three formats internationally for a top nation.,11
"Damn, a sensible decision by our management? What is this world coming to?",7
So who is up for a test match?,6
Now if only Eoin could come up ahead of Karthik.,9
"RCB boys, I bought a new book from the stationary today. Let the season of mind bending calculations begin. 🤗 Btw who should win and by what margin today?",1
"Change in opening order, yay!",1
great shot,1
"Deepak Chahar, Rahul Tripathi and Dhoni. Nice tribute to RPS",6
"Csk doesn't have an out an out pace bowler...Narine gamble could have paid off. 
They made him open against quicker guys man.",2
"Know your limits Master Chahar, no one could have swung it that much",6
Finally KKR giving the narine experiment a rest,4
I hate our bowling so much,1
Already a better start than Narine,6
Thank goodness they opened with Tripathi. I thought they would open with him after they played 12 or 13 matches /s.,2
"Told my grandma to skip her sleeping meds today. Snooze-fest, this match. She'll sleep by 9 easy peazy.",-1
Tripathi looks a million dollars,1
"Woah Tripathi is a Maharashtrian boy, gotta support KKR today then!",11
Good seam position tho,1
should narine have opened today? since csk doesnt have any express pace bowlers,8
Jesus the KKR camp looks dead,1
Jadhav and Dhoni partnership a key for KKRs victory,3
Karn Sharma makes 5.2 crores this season,2
"Bring russell at 3 , there is noone in csk bowling who can intimidate him.",2
"Kedar jadhav is just OP. 

He doesn't need to do anything to get in the 11.",5
"Brett Lee's bias for KKR is obvious. 

After all, he's BingaLee.",128
Finally Narine is not opening,5
"Good fielding,but looks in",1
Dhoni to Tripathi:- shankar Ham tmko pala hu!!,3
He clearly reached?,1
Glad Tripathi is opening,2
Bruh Karn Sharma looks like a mob-boss.,6
Dude that's so clearly not out. Why tf you gotta waste time like this?,10
Out,1
"Go subhuman Gill, Go!",2
Bro wtf. The umpire was not even looking at the stumps.,2
"These umpires are making easy money. No work, all pay",7
Lol why he referred to 3rd umpire we never will know,2
Karn Sharma looks like a BJP leader with 3 riots already under his belt.,118
OMG the wicket is **B R O K E N**,4
Remember when Faf got Parthiv runout in a final? Similar runout.,5
How Tahir hasn’t played a single game is beyond me.,1
umpires waste time for bs like this and then have to give soft signals for catches that happen 70 metres away,20
Sam Quran,5
What intent we seeing today?,1
That cringy “the game” ad from State Farm for Willow viewers. Gets me every time,1
That was a sexy shot,2

"Sam Curran is our main attacking bowler, don't know to laugh or cry looking at CSK bowling attack.",15
Great shot by Gill but big oof,2
There is no shot more beautiful than a straight drive for 4,5
CSK attack is one bowling lineup Narine could've possibly succeeded against. Interesting choices KKR have made.,8
What's the par score here? 170?,3
"Sometimes I wonder how it must feel like to be

Mark Waugh

K Pandya

Never hit the stumps directly when it really matters.,4

Id love to go on a date with Sam Curran. Such a cutie.,11
Glad they are not opening with Suresh Narine today.,6
"Good to see kkr learning after losses


Removing a non utility naik after first

Making batting line up stronger after second

I feel more confident now",12
Can these commentators stop about big name bullshit,7

What's up with those risky singles,4
Just don't get runout man,3
If he was playing Australia Jadeja would have hit both of those. Dude never misses against us,84
Is Tripathi on a suicide mission wtf,1
Holy fuck jadeja throws like a gun,6
The crowd was really excited about that single lol,10
"Why would you bowl short when the ball is swinging, or when you have no deep midwicket?",3
karn sharma is in for piyush chawla simply on the basis of not being as much of a chunky monkey,5

Start swinging ur lathi (bat)",4
"KKR actually looks dangerously strong on paper. Abundance of in form Indian batsmen. Morgan + Russell, probably the best complimentary pair. Cummins + 2 talented Indian uncapped fast bowlers. Narine, Kuldeep and Varun. Surprisingly they haven't performed upto their mark. I think they're not far from MI or DC strength.",23

Ugh stop looking at that and just declare a boundary,5

It's a boundary!,3
How did that take so long lmao!?!,1
Shardul Thakur was the number 10 for India after Sachin. He got so much flame for that.,5

Thakur's gonna bowl 180 kph against Tripathi lol,1
"Hotstar is having some issues, ahh man",1

They couldn't zoom in on his pinky and the ball so we could see lol,3
Kkr finally getting a good first few overs. I wonder why.,11
Chahar can just bowl outside off and keep a good line. But why do that when you can needlessly try to vary and bowl medium pace bouncers?,2
"Deepak you stupid fuck. The ball is not only swinging, but you also don't have deep fine. You have just been smashed over deep midwicket for bowling short as well. So WHYYYYYY would you bowl short?   


Gosh some cricketers really lack some thinking do they",6
Irfan Pathan Seeing 129 Kph Chahar getting carted makes his blood boils. Even though Pathan lost his potent swing he was equal to chahar in pace wise 😭😂😭,2

I see 200+ score already.. which CSK will struggle so badly to chase 😭",8

I wanna brush Sam's hair and feed him grapes and tell him about my day while some Iron and Wine plays in the background,14

So happy to watch Tripathi open,6
Pretty surprised to see that Tripathi is 29. I thought he was 25 or 26.,2
Morgan will bat 9,6
Sammy runs in with a face of a kid who larps as the evil power ranger.,1
A'ight. Sam's stay in the CSK side is coming to an end lads. Sad but that's how the management works. Expect Tahir or Ngidi/Josh in next match.,2
Why has this Tripathi guy not just got out for 7 off 5 like Narine?,4

Tripathi looks in great form. surely he would've been hitting some in nets too. took too long for master tactician coach sir mcculum to notice that.,4
LORD IS HERE!!,4
Tripathi's 2017 season for Pune is super underrated. 391 runs at a strike rate of 146 for an opener is fantastic. Was really crucial in their run to the final.,9
"Contrary to the prevailing belief here, I’d say KKR should have gone with Narine to open today, because it is against CSK and their powerplay bowling is very ordinary.",-1

Imo Sunil Narine should forget about batting and only focus on his bowling. There shouldn't be any pressure on him to give kkr a good start. He's economical but doesn't take wickets anymore like he used to. He can get back in form and he's a great asset for kkr as a pure bowler,6

Narine at 4 makes no sense at all. He is a handy bat down the order who was used as a slogger up top as a pinch hitter. They have a good base in this game. Just Morgan at 4 and Russell at 5. There are a perfect number of overs left for these two to create an impact.,2

this narine move is to take on the spinners. whether or not its a good move is questionable,2

Narine is not a floater Baz. Let it go,7

Sunil Narine over Morgan at 4 sums up Mcculum's coaching career.,15
"Narine at 4
6D chess Captaincy + Management",5
So good to see jaaved jaafry in his takeshi's castle styled advertisement. That was one of my favourite childhood shows,3
CSK jerseys remind me of the jerseys of Villarreal CF in Spain. They're called the yellow submarine which is a cool ass nick name tbh,3
I can understand this type of strategies if Amir Khan was the team owner. But we are talking of King Khan. He'd never do that!,2
"I like how this sub thinks DK is taking all the decisions about batting order. And, Brendon Mccullum (who is the TKR coach as well) and David Hussey are there to eat free lunches.",13
Breaking: Eoin Morgan doesn’t exist,9
Karthik in at 5 and r/cricket loses its shit forever,9
Why is Big Show in CSK dugout,5
if narine is going to rotate the strike why the fuck would you not send morgan?,7
this is peak DK. This is the man who had Washington opening and Ashwin at no.3 for Tamil Nadu. Tbf to him it almost worked - they got to both the 50 over and 20 over finals,14
Ngl dk had is in the first half. Convinced all of us that he had learned from his mistakes so far. But nah....,2
"Calling a Narine 13(15) now, dibs",6
Well played Tripathi.,2
mike hussey with the Mr.Fantastic hairstyle.,3
2020 is doing a DK and it needs a Tevatia.,5
And Tripathi rightfully cements his place.,6
Yeah Rahul! Show 'em what they've missed,2
Dinesh Karthik will now go captain T&T Knight Riders too giving BCCI a big fuck you in the process,3
"If Narine lasts any longer than the end of 12th over, it would be  a blunder.",3
It's almost like you play an opener at the top and he'll do well,8
Gg Tripathi,2
I want tripathi to get a 100 and show everyone what a quality player he is,3
Just when you think  KKR management got sane they do something even Wierder,6
Well played G,1
narine is just painful to watch.,3
Is kkr rolling a dice to decide the batting order?,5
Now Narine will put pressure on Tripathi which would make him loose his wicket.,5
Fucking Bon Jovi in 2020. What is up with this dj lol.,6
How good is this? Finally Tripathi at the top. Almost all of us were calling for this.,2
"Morgan coming to bat:

Narine: *yar ye mai kar leta hu aap dream 11 mai jake team bana lo*",8
"morgans gonna come in at 7 isn't he, behind DK and Russell. Ridiculous decision making!",1
India now has too much competition for openers,5
"Samson : "" Why hasn't Tripathi played for India yet? """,5
It’s not a CSK vs KKR match. It’s Mike Hussey vs Mota Hussey,4
This is definitely a McCullum move to send Narine in...they have good base Morgan and Russell can easily build on it to reach 200,1
Well played Tripathi!,1
"It is inherently Captain's responsibility about every team decision. Captain's word is more important than anyone else. If anything goes wrong, he'll be the first one to be criticised and rightly so.",2
David Hussey already looking 50+ while Mike looks like he just crossed 40,5
I though Morgan and McCulum were buds?,8
Does anyone have any idea why they sent in narine now?,7
"Narine consistently gets to bat ahead of Morgan because



....fuck Logic",6
"have a feeling russel will be sent out too early after this leading to him getting out, and then dk will come in, leaving morgan at 7",4

Pat Cummins in at 5,8
Hope Tripathi is fit enough to go hammer in the last 5 overs.,5
"Not saying MI is perfect but they keep it very simple with their batting order. This helps their players because they bat at same/similar positions and get better as tournament progresses if someone is not in top form. 

Stable team is important in T20 too",5
"And right there, DK has completely cancelled out the advantage he gained by making Tripathi open by sending DK. What on earth is he even thinking?",1
DK is r/cricket’s official windup merchant,3
David Hussey looks 20 years older than Michael,3
Narine looking around the field to see who he can give a catch to,3
Opening with an actual opener actually works huh?Who would've thunk!,6
Mike Hussey looks more and more like  David Hussey as time passes,5

Playing Narine at 4 is beyond my understanding of cricket.,5
Naraine at no 4 is totally nonsensical!!!,3

"Wow. Just checked the score and Tripathi!

Look at that, management. Its almost like you'll get a good start if you use proper openers",13
Makes you wonder if Baz has been writing pages and pages only to profess his love to Narine at the end of the tournament /s,11
"I guess they have delayed Jadeja from bowling with that Narine ""4d chess move""",7
RR really wasted a couple of years of Tripathi's career playing him in the lower middle order.,5

I was so happy for not letting him open. DK has disappointed.",1

"Narine should have always been surprise floater like this  
 
batting at high SR against opposition's best bowlers was always gonna be difficult",6
Damn Narine played a class shot,8
It is not DK's turn today. It is Narine who is coming back to form.,4
It’s a brain-dead terrible decision. But if it works it works.,5
Bowling half volleys to Narine is as brilliant as sending Narine at 4,4
We bullied another player into performing again let's goooo,5
Lmao r/cricket armchair experts at it again,2
If Narine plays a good knock with a high strike rate please send Russell and Morgan next,7

DK: Outstanding move,4
"Me: Narine sucks

Narine: I'm going to end this shitposter",3
Narine giving the treatment it deserves.,1
Bravo is trash now I am sorry should have played Hazlewood,5
Narine took a 2. This. Is. Biblical.,3
RR did a mistake by releasing rahul Tripathi. Just imgaine rahul and  buttler opening for RR,8
Narine has already done his Job,3
eoin morgan would have hit 4 sixes by now so it don't matter,1
NARINE’S FLUKES DO NOT JUSTIFY MORGAN’S DEMOTION,1
Bravo's secret ball used to be the slower delivery. Now his secret ball is a fast ball which never comes.,4

This is how you use Narine. Send him anywhere as a floater when the team is on top,7
DK actually does all the things I wanted a captain to do watching cricket as a kid,11
DK might not be a great captain but his mediocrity is far surpassed by r/cricket's ability to be wrong,10
Narine always destroys fellow Trinidadians same happened with Badree in 2017,4
Narine actually ran a 2!! KKR's luck might actually be changing now,8
"Stupid fucking Jadhav can't even throw straight. Seriously, what is he doing while super talented youngsters like Ruturaj and Jaga warm the bench",12

More than 2 sixes or Narine Wicket this over,3
DK to r/cricket: I am going to end this man's whole career,12
Kedhar showing dhoni he can spin the ball in the air with his throws lmao,10
Karn is such a big hearted bowler,1
Was Karn always this big?,2
Narine doing well at 4 today would be the worst thing that can happen to KKR. They are massively underutilizing Russell and now Morgan as well. He comes through today and they will continue doing it. Will get fucked against quality bowling attacks with this strategy and Russell and Morgan will never get enough balls to make the impact they can.,5
So when are we getting a Narine redemption post?,3
Narine can be useful for messing with the bowling team's strategy. Though it's not really necessary to use him if things are going well.,4
Karen Sharma bowling strategy: Finish your action so quickly that the batsman has no chance of picking up what you're gonna do.,7
Lol Narine is so derp and meme,2
Off topic : How is your mental health?,8
Where are the fielders?,2
Narine should only be used as floater to tonk the spinners.,3
CSK gonna be chasing over 220 here,5
KKR has the second best batting line-up behind MI & third best team.,2
We've seen a lot of batsmen slip while running. Do you reckon it's because of the different surfaces in the middle east?,2
What happens if a batsman knocks the wickets while taking a run?,3
Kedhar showing his exceptional fielding skills.,13
Unrelated comment but I just slapped the soul out of the mosquito which has been bothering for past 15 minutes,14
"KKR batting line up is the Pandora's box of cricket.

Nightmare for opponents to strategize against though.",4

₹ 7.8 crores worth of ball throwing,2
"Narine in 2018 

357 runs at a SR of 185

17 wickets in 16 games with economy at 6.72",5

"Wtf, there was 2 there.",3
Dream 11 fans are dancing like clowns 😅😅,7
"I guess Dk is messing with dhonis mind, if Narine breaks loose,he has to resort to his death bowlers,that frees up overs for Russel and Morgan. If dhoni sticks to his weaker bowlers,Narine can keep scoring",3
So when CSK gonna start playing for nrr,4
"Tripathi deserves some luck, that was first false shot of this innings so far.",3
I remember when this chip shot for 2 was a regular shot in limited overs  cricket. In the 90s I think.,3
So don't send in Morgan while opposition is in a hurry to bowl their leg spinner out. I don't understand,1
Running between the wickets have been really good in this match.,2
So easy to mistake Karn for Chawla looking at their actions from behind.,1
"Ah ,yes cringe fans . will be back after sipping my unsee juice.",2
Yeah baby do the gangam style on the big screen,2
Missing ^so ^many ^throws,3
Tripathi playing with fire,3
Lmao I think this is the first time I've seen Narine play a sweep shot,5
They play cricket as a profession and get paid. They should hit the stumps 7/10 times with their throws. Not 1/10. And no excuses.,7
argh why sunil,1
I think Chawla might have been a better pick for this game,2
That's Jaddu back to his best,5
Fuck me,3

Great presence of mind by Jaddu,3
Great catch. Didn't need to relay but ok,2
Who is that? Is it our Rayudu garu?,2

Amazing fielding.,4
Just wow,3

Still his best innings this IPL,4

I'm not even mad he got out to that,4
Please send DK.,1
"It's okay, did his job. Let the big bois come in now",6
Good cameo by Narine. Did his job.,2
This is what I admire about Jadeja. A very committed player who gives it all on the field.,4
I was on the phone and I just looked over the screen and what a catch.,4
"Sir Jadeja, watta waow.",1
Who caught that!!!,2
Narine did his job tbh,3
Jadeja can fuck me any day of the week,3
Damn🔥,3
"Jadeja, you beautiful fielding GOAT.",4
What the fuck just happened,6
Jadeja making it up for those missed throws with this screamer.,6
17(8) Narine did his job,7
Doesn't matter still I would say that move of narine at 4 worked,6

CSK probably have the most number of ""Highlight Reel"" catches(this season) despite them being perceived as a weak fielding side.",10
"My life is so fucked 

Expected RR to fuck everyone, but they themselve got fucked.

Expected my crush to ask me out,but she asked out someone else and I got rejected",4
All hail Sir Jadeja . Dude can literally be selected alone on fielding basis,6
Lol Jadeja actually need not pass it to Faf lmao. He never actually hit the boundary ropes,7
"Morgan: Fine I'll do it myself, these bhenchods never learn",5
Pretty sure Faf is the captain of Jaddu's fantasy team. Gave him 16pts lol,49
"Jadeja knew how badass that was lmao, he was smiling at the end.",29
DK please come in,1
Jadeja and Faf combined bringing decency to CSK's otherwise lackluster fielding stats.,14
This was an ideal Narine innings,11
Lol that's not needed at all.,5
"Du Plessis (Goal), Jadeja (Assist).",7
DK pls come in. for the bantz,5
Surprised faf also didn't throw it up and go in and out of the boundary for the fun of it,35
Insane core strength by Jadeja to throw that back up on a slide,11
"I'm very confused, what happened? I just read on cricbuzz ""caught by du Plessis,, just Jadeja things"" lol",10
"Yesterday Sky and today Tripathi

Love players like these. Who aren't hyped much but keep giving performances like these. Ruturaj next!",4
R not there any folks shitting in Dk for sending Morgan ahead of Rusell now??  Lol,6

"Manish dropped a couple of catches, redeemed himself later with a stunner! 

Jadeja dropped a couple, what he did now was amazing!

"So Karan Sharma has two wickets now, Dhoni Masterstroke?",14
"Baz and DK must be congratulating each other for sending Narine at 4 after that *destructive*, *potentially match winning* inning of 9 balls 17 by Narine",5
Look at these old ass motherfuckers pulling a legendary piece of fielding. Brilliance from Jadeja and Faf.,9
"He was sliding so much, even the grass in Middle East has oil in it wtf",7

That wasn't as hard a catch as Jadeja made it seem lmao.,4
"I’m laughing so hard at Graeme right now, my standards have dropped",4
"Commentator: Narine batting at number 4 for the second time. Seems to be liking this position, 17 off 8

Narine: Bitch please",7
This is what an ideal Narine innings looks like. 17(9).,8
Karn Sharma was MOTM against KKR in 2017 playoffs,6
The catch...the jadeja...and the faf...i dont even want to mention twilight,7
tripathi treating these balls  like tirupathi laddoos,7
So awkward between Swann and Sanjay,5

Bhai Morgan???,1

Oooff that drive,4
"You kids think this is irritating. But pray you never have to endure what we did in the 2010 finals with Sachin's absolutely brain dead captaincy. For those of you who don't remember, MI sent Pollard in to chase an almost unwinnable target at fuckin no 8 after he had demolished nearly every team on the way to the finals. Harbhajan Singh batted at no.4 ffs! Sachin is absolutely the worst captain in the history of captains in my book. That was an easy chase and I'm still salty we didn't win it. People like to think Sachin was a bad captain in the 90s because he had a bad team. But even when he was leading a side as gifted as the 2010 MI side, he was fuckin trash. 

I swear if I had a gun, I'd have done something to myself.",17

Beautiful!,3

What a fine shot by Morgan,2
"Tripathi playing good while opening, happy for him",5
damn morgan! sweet,5
That shot tho.,2
Morgan and first ball boundary. Name a better duo,4
Any batsman in Tripathi's position would have wanted all that luck today. If Jaddu had direct hit him out earlier on that would've put a lot of pressure on him and his position.,2

narine did his job. 20 odd runs scored at 200 strike rate.,6
I forgive you DK I,10
Morgan to DK: Observe,21
Get Morgan out😒😒😒,1

Chad moves by Jaddu and Faf.,9

Morgan don’t play well. You’ll bat 9 next game if you do,6
"Harsha:Can they get 200 in 9? Thakur: Dream a little bigger, darling",12
Dugout guys saying Tripathi sounds like Chhapati.,9
Why send a pinch hitter when you have Morgan? 🤦,1
How long before we see a relay catch involving three or more fielders?,10
Left handed cover drives >>>>>>>,11
Will it come under Jedaja or Faf catch,8
So basically Rana did a narine n Narine did a Rana today,13
KKR are adamant about their left and right combos huh.,9
"Run rate above 9, 8 full overs left. I see easy 200+",10

Shardul McDermott anyone? Get ur cunt on and delivery sweet chin music.,3
Tripathi opening and Morgan batting at 5? 2020 continues to be weird,9
Using left right combo in a better way,5
Fuck that catch was credited to du plessis.. wth,6
"Damn, Morgan's bat lift is pretty high.",1
Is Tripathi also a WK?,6
Does the team get negatively impacted if the captain is insecure about his batting?,11
Anyone rooting up for a Tripathi 100 now??,29
"Tripathi is playing a nice innings here, hope he goes long",2
Looks like we will cross 160 which makes Dhoni play for opposition team if you can actually get him to the crease.,9
I think it's time to remove the lordship title of Thakur. How the fuck can he bowl economical and chahar go 11rpo.,8
Wow how is Thakur bowling so good. Is it 2020 effect,2
"We see so many good players year after year at the IPL, but they never tickle the selectors’ interest for the national team",1
Weird that Tripathi had to sit out for 3 years lmao,5
Where was this thakur all this time? 9-1 in 2 overs dayummm,1
Only Females I get are female mosquitoes 😀🙌,-6
Varun to bat next,2
Lord thakur bowling rather well.,3
Shardul has improved,9
RCB has a young squad but they field so shit at the boundary. Compare that to CSK which is basically a retirement home. Dynamite on the boundary,10
"Sunil Narine : * gets famous for murdering spin in the IPL*

Jadeja not bowling?,1
Where is russell,-1
"Morgan looked absolutely in golden touch in his first two deliveries. Then for his next four, looked like someone who's absolutely out of form who can't even lay his bat to the ball.",2
Patty has fixed his hair slightly,1
I still remember Tripathi's innings vs KKR back when he played for Pune. Was dismissed on 93 with less than 10 runs to chase. That was such a fluid innings from him when everyone else on his side were falling like flies. I think he was the only one who went past 20 that game for Pune.,29
Did Dhoni even appeal?,1
"bahot badhiya, karn",0
"'Nice and slow, nice and slow'

That was a Wile E Coyote moment for Chahar,2
Karn has outperformed PC,5
Why is every KKR batsman except Tripathi struggling here,7
why does the batting order look like dk put the numbers 1-11 into a random sorter,4

[deleted],9
Swann now shilling Ceat Strategic Timeout. Found a new sponsor.,1
It'll either be an 8 wicket victory for CSK or a post-2016 Dhoni special chase.,-7
They did not send Tripathi to open because he lasts too long /s.,7
KKR might have send in Narine for Dhoni to not use Jadeja in a 4D chess move. But Dhoni probably had no plans to use him from the start!,6
"DK, Morgan, Russell all asking Baz to bat higher

Baz can't decide between them so he just sends in Narine.",14
csk winning this is entirely dependent on watto,14
Iyer's acting reminded me of KRK,10
Narine's 17 (9) can turn out to be quite crucial by  the end of the game.,15
"Reminder to everyone that WhiteHatJr is a fucking scam

E: please take a look at some of his posts u/pooniahigh",45
"All anti Dk in this sub r Murali Vijay fans

That was a great spell by Karn. CSK have just pulled things back slightly here. Wonder who'll Karthik decide to send next.,6
"Bc coding karne se desh kabse badal jaata hain, fucking whitehat",8
Pls keep Karn in the team next match. I just can't see chawla running in the field it's just atrocious.,6
karn will stay on the team his figures were very good,2
Tripathi with a 100 and Russell with a 14 ball 50. I hope my jinx works.,10
Piyush Chawla serving bananas 😂,10
Chawla serving bananas to Jaddu is.....ok,7
Sam ‘the terminator’ Curran.,0
I miss Lynn at KKR... or playing at all for that matter,4
Who else cringed watching Dhoni Oppo ad,0
Excellent long term strategy by KKR to ensure selection of Karn for next matches.,8
Third Umpire sounds like he is an indian in an american movie,2
"Wait, why did Jaiswal just peg that straight into the ground?",1

He was a gonzo,0

Lmao Tripathi survived 3 runout chances,4
Sam Curran bowling at Morgan. A nation holds its breath.,8

How many times has Tripathi survived the run outs,0
ooh sam bowling at the skipper,5

KKR are trying to increase their score and CSK don't want that,0
"Idk if this is relevant here,but jaiswal fucking looks handsome with that hair. No homo",1
I swear if Russell doesn't send CSK's army of dibbly dobblers into the next dimension...,-1
Off topic but can anyone tell me how whitehat is scam ?,1
Who hurt DK?,0
Anybody remembers when Kuldeep used to play,1
What is Morgan doing? Russell is yet to bat and he is doing tuk-tuk.,1
"Tripathi really hates being in either crease lol, good batting tho",5
Fleming has the best reaction faces. His reaction to Pune paying so much for Stokes(iirc) during the auctions was such a classic.,3
Tripathis weakness is fucking obvious...running between wickets,2
Too many hitters left to not be hitting.,3
Tripathi running in the middle of the pitch like a champ.,3
Being swept is the ultimate insult to a fast bowler imo. Maybe only batting without a helmet comes close.,4
"it's almost criminal and unfair that MI has boult, pattinson, bumrah , pollard and pandya as bowling options while the only good bolwer we had is injured. Now we're left with 110 kmph pie chuckers",3

On Banger's team Santer will probably not get a game,8
"""Sun was on my eyes"" moment",4
Imagine being the captain of England and playing only the last few overs as a finisher in the ipl,5
Bangar is terrible in the dugout,6
Bangar chose Virat over Rohit. What an idiot. Kohli has only one good game,4
"Tripathi is trying so hard to give his wicket. *Le lo, are bhai le lo*",5

"Lil Sammy's growing up

Looking a bit aggy today and he's grown some fluff on his face",3
Bangar chose Santner lmao he hasn’t even got a game,11
Curran looking older and more stressed out by the day.,1
Why are commentators cribbing about Narine No. 4 experiment? Its not as if he wasted balls. He scored 17 off 9 and thats what he was supposed to do as a pinch hitter.,6
Bangar lmao,4
Idiot Bangar has picked Santner in his Fantasy XI,13
Banger's team is some vanilla stuff,3
BC Tripathi hit or get out.,2
Tripathi seems to have no sense of when there’s a single & when there’s not,7
Ok Swann we don't do gre words here lol. Facetious 🙄,2
Lol Swann and bangar,1
"Fuck these lights.

No wonder so many drops",2
Tripathi is too lucky today he cant get out,8
Tripathi has Curran in his fantasy team seems like.,3
Tripathi is exhausted af,1
Why is everyone struggling to time the ball??,0
The only way CSK can win this game is by scoring more than KKR in their innings,2
Bangar is so slow,1
Don't apologise Swann. It was stupid of Bangar to select Santner who will probably never be selected this IPL.,5
Projected Score is obsolete why do they keep showing this every game,1
"Abey out hoja,
Get out man.

Trying hard to out",0
Bangar justifying picking santner lmao,4
Bangar hasn't understood a single jone on the Dugout so far lol,3
3D play by CSK not letting Russel come in by letting Tripathi play,1
Understood. Tripathi won't get out today.,4
Tripathi looks tired. Seems like he has lost a bit of his strength,6
It's getting awkward in the dugout with Swann and Sanjay lmao,8
Nobody does it better than CSK when it comes to not getting the struggling batsman out,3
KKR have missed at least 5 extra potential doubles,8
RUSSELL TIME BITCH,6

Sam Curran won't be playing for England's limited overs sides for a while then,12
Rip Currans LOI England career,7

Samuel is the only player that I want to do well in CSK,1
"Curran bowling bouncer to his captain

Wish commentators had that gut",6
"**13.6** Curran to Morgan, OUT, and there is a wicket at the wrong end. It is Tripathi who should be getting out from KKR's point of view. Instead it is Morgan gone off a really good sharp bouncer. It is angled into the body and over his right shoulder and takes the glove on the way through to Dhoni **114-4**

EJG Morgan c &dagger;Dhoni b Curran 7 (10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70.00",3
Russel out there makes me very very uncomfortable. He could take apart Shardul and Chahar at the end,4
Sam getting his captain out.,4
Suddenly Narine seems a better choice than Morgan eh /s,3
DK playing as a specialist captain,5
This was the perfect innings for Morgs to fire. Disappointing knock tbh.,2
"The one time Morgan is sent over DK and  Russel, he ends up not performing lol",4
Narine > Morgan confirmed.,1
"I know hes just been dismissed and probably wrong time to ask, but has anyone really seen Morgan smile this IPL?",3
Narine at number 4 looks like a genius move in retrospect. The run rate would be looking horrendous without his contribution,2
SRK,1
Only one Curran shall remain in the team now,3
Deepak is bowling shit. Wtf was that leg stump half volley. Umesh Yadav like,2
Who is DK,2
Chahar has been shit today,1
Chahar bowling like a bhenchod,4
Fuck yeah,2

Why the fuck do you keep bowling on his pads,1
"Can't wait for Cork to get into the Dugout so Bangar never fucking returns, he speaks at x0.5 speed, such a pain to listen to",6
Lets jinx Dre Russ so he doesn't get to double digits,6

Wow! Jadeja didnt even bowl today! That's something,5
Who are they announcing this for? There's no one in the fricken stadium,8
Chahar has forgotten how to bowl is it?,6
Suryakumar Tripathi scoring in the V behind wicket,4
Single digit score for Russell today,3
Tripathi is apparently ex RCB. Figures,5
The K in SRK stands for Kocaine,7
Why is Tripathi vibrating while facing lmao?,5
"Man, Madhuri still looks stunning after all these years. Looks like she took a bath in the fountain of youth.",12
It's interesting how batsmen who don't have a great big hitting game try the ramp shot to get boundaries. SKY yesterday and now Tripathi too.,6
Rahul flicks with one knee on the ground as if he's proposing someone,3
3rd time Chahar bowling same shit ball down the leg,2

Cmon KKR!,2
Karan four overs done?,2

DADDY TRIPATHY,4
I see csk getting murdered today by russ,2
Fine leg up.. A nice military medium outside the leg stump. Just begging to get hit for a boundary that.,4
Chahar giving Umesh level freebies,7
Atrocious bowling from Chahar. He is single handedly costing CSK the game.,4
Chahar's not having a good day today,3
Fucking beyond leg stump line.. fucking joker,3
Jesus another shit ball,3

Chahar what the fuck,4
Bc itka gavthi shot 😂😂,6
Kkr need 180 minimum,1

Remember when Shane Watson used to bowl??,10
Lord Chahar nearing a quick fifty,2
Seeing Rahul bat pisses me off on how RR underutilized him by making him bat down the order,9
Bangar is silent lol,3
Why are all the bowlers bowling at the leg today? So many unwanted boundaries,4
Chahar is not the same after he got COVID,3

Andre Tripathi,6
Give Ambati an over,3
"Despite Morgan's failure today, this batting order is perfect with narine as floater. DK should come as low as possible. Once he himself said he feels most sorted when he is finishing.",4
we live in a world where narine and thakur r better than chahar and morgan,3
Chahar single handedly changing the momentum of the match. In KKR's favour that it is. KKR fan probably disappointed that they won't be getting anymore over from him.,3
"If another wicket falls now, DK should send Cummins just for the memes",3
These commentators never laugh at each other's jokes lol,5
Tripathi for 100?,1

"**Andre Russell vs CSK between overs 16 and 20**

Hindi comms (except Pathan) are calling Sam Curran stupid who didn't know Morgan struggle against short stuff. Dhoni had to tell him twice what to bowl with right field setting because he didn't understand it first time. Wtf is this commentary. Pathan is only sane one who says Curran understands Morgan's game because they play together and was asking Dhoni to set the field.,9
Karthik calling Karthik - ye mein kar leta hoon. Tab tak aap \#7 mein khelo.,1
Hope Tripathi scores a 100 today. It has been 12 long years since we saw a KKR batsman reach that milestone.,3

"hehe, we are in trouble",5
"**15.2** Thakur to Russell, OUT, huge wicket. Russell clears the front leg to slog to leg, but Thakur has been superb. Unerring with his length. Short of a length, cross-seam, lands on the seam, bounces, and takes the top edge through to Dhoni **128-5**

WTF happened to DK?,3
russell needs rcb's bowling to get back into form,10
"There's gonna be a talk about sending Narine ahead.
And DK's gonna get criticised.",7
Thakur has turned into Bumrah ffs,17

Looks like KKR need Tripathi up top and at the end of the middle order too 🤦‍♂️,6
Btw is Tripathi playing on a different pitch?,3
Russel gone taken by Lordd Thakur.,2
Has the pitch slowed down or is Thakur just a lord?,2
Russell has no brain,5
DK looking Jatin Sapru now,5
"For the past few seasons, karthik has been a good pinch hitter at the end. Failing to bat in the top order. Lets see how he does here",3
Thakur has surprisingly been impressive,11

Dk turned into a different human being with that look,10
They are not even reaching 170 from here. Whats the point of that deep batting ?,6
"175 frm here

Both team will be ok",9
"DK to r/cricket: ""Aap hi Dream11 pe team banao, mujhe mera kaam mat batao""",14
This Amir khan dummy ceat ad gives me nightmares,4
Shardul and Karn were the surprise performers today,6
DK with no beard is Cooler DK 😎,5
Audio sync is slightly better now,2
400 IQ by Karthik to send everyone else before him to show how they fail as well.,100
"Thakur next over gonna be a hattrick over

\#YouHeardItHereFirst",8
Imagine expecting Delhi rejects like Russell to perform lol.,10
DK should pretend he's facing Bengali bowlers,12
[removed],-8
KKR bought Tripathi for less than 1 Cr. He could easily have fit in SRH at number 3 and everyone else moves down one slot.,24
"Right from ball one, there's been complacence and over-confidence from Russell this season. Not just in the IPL, but in the CPL too. Of course he succeeded to an extent in the CPL because the bowling is shite, but that ain't gonna happen in the IPL. 

Someone needs to remind him to stay grounded.  He's not bigger than the team.",20
All the rahuls giving great performances,3
Imagine this innings without tripathy,3
177 is my prediction,1
Guys I know KKR's deep batting line up hasn't really delivered but we shouldn't discredit CSK and the way they've bowled,4
Das went into salesman mode there,2
Honestly might be worth KKR deciding their batting order by randomly picking names out of a hat at this point,4
i think the reason why DK shaved so that we can know who's the real DK,5
Score will easily be 180,3
Aah we didn't use Jadeja today thanks to karn sharma,5
"DK before shaving: Adorable

DK after shaving: Child Predator",6
"Reminder that bowling hasn’t been our problem this year, but batting. Last match was kind of an anomaly. We are on top now but it will mean nothing if our batting shits the bed again",2
Seeing dk clean shave is like seeing 2007 all over again (that natwest series was dope af though),5
Today is Jadhav’s day,6
Lord Thakur killing it,2
"Pollard > Russell (as finisher)
Pollard takes his time and picks his bowlers. Russell is much more brutal but seems way too hasty",15
I want to drive the Altroz off a bridge,7
😂 this shaved DK is his evil twin,3
"Sam Curran dismissing Eoin Morgan for the first time in T20 cricket, it was his 7th innings against him.",6
When is nidahas starting,3
"Seen a lot more racism and baiting in these ipl threads compared to normal threads

Come on guys, cut this shit out",10
"BC kya batting kar rahein ho, get to 180 at least.

T: stop fucking around and get to 180 at least.",2
I just want Tripathi to get his 100.,7
Another 10 wickets win on the cards? Hope not but KKR giving all bad vibes. Should get 180+ with the start they had,0
"Bumrah, Archer, Rabada, Thakur. One of these is better than the others. 😆",5
Chad Tripathi with his big dick FOURS,4
That Russell wicket was massive . Not just that he is destructive in general but record against Bravo is utterly ridiculous.  If he was staying for the last 4 over KKR probably would have scored 80 runs atleast,9
Tripathi gonna make a century today,4
I wish Bravo bowls well ooof,1
This is my opinion from my arm chair but Baz  is disrupting this potentially IPL winning team with too much unconventionality,8
Did I just watch the camera pan to Altroz and commentator not say a word about it? Crazy times!,6
Whats the par score here?,4
I think DK shaved his beard so as not to get confused while batting with tripati..both wearing similar helmets,8
Birthday boy bowling birthday pies today,4
Indias t20 future is looking so fucking bright that I need sunglasses to take a look at it,7
DK shaved to regain his wife,-2
Russel has been proper shit this IPL,7
"Sometimes I feel we average people are much smarter than the people running so many teams. Why is Tripathi so undervalued having proven himself, could've easily filled the voids at SRH or RR and I daresay even RCB could've tried for him.",8
Have a hunch that thakur's figure will detiorate in his last over,4
It won't be Bravo's over without one juicy delivery,3
"CSK winning the IPL?! Absolutely not going to happen. I am in India right now and touring rural Chennai. Whoever is telling you this is either only interacting with a limited subset or has a perception bias. Let's come back to this comment after the elections. I will double gild you if you're right. From what I am seeing, deDhonitisation is going fuck CSK in the 2020 IPL. They were cruising earlier and doing even better in the first match. But not anymore.",4
Bravo continuing the birthday curse,10
"They were 102-3 after 67 balls...last 33 balls, 38 runs and 2 wickets",6
"This isn't KKR v CSK, this is Tripathi vs CSK.",7
Hope he gets a century here.,5
"I just hope the Dinesh "" Nidahas "" Karthik doesn't come out.",9
Tripathi looks such a complete batsman when he plays in the IPL. I wonder why that talent doesn't translate into domestic success as his domestic stats are abysmal.,7
"So, looks like Banton will have to wait for few more matches on the bench.",5
Just want to see a Tripathi 100,2
Even younger CSK players are shit fielders,-1
Late post but dint knew Sam Curran can get that kinda steep bounce in UAE. Amazing Bouncer to get his Skipper Morgan.,10
soft dismissal again.,6
Who is that fielder,5
Looked like a bumper,5
Time to get off Samson and Suryakumar Hype train I am gonna hop on Tripathi for India train if he makes 100 today ❤️🥰,13
If itsn't out he's extremely lucky today,6
Umpires discussing on their vadapavs for dinner,4
Weird wicket,8
Soft signal absolutely doesn't make any sense to me,21
That has to be one of the most random wickets this IPL lol.,28
[deleted],1
looks out,7
[deleted],12
Hate it when Bravo tries to be over smart and tries too many long balls and slower deliveries instead of Yorkers which is he is perfectly capable of bowling,10
Nooo. Deserved a 100,17
That's it bois.,9
This 3rd umpire is fast!,13
These misfieldings can get costly,1
[deleted],10
Tripathi looking more like DK than DK,11
Could have easily scored 100 today,4
Ugh,1
That's so fucking sad man. He deserved a 100.,8
Gg,1
How did he see the catch clearly from that angle?,5
Great knock tho,2
"why the soft signal tho, they are not checking the catch itself",3
Cummin's special now,5
"Oof soft dismissal after a good knock

At least I'll be able to tell the 2 batsmen apart with ease again",9
Well played man,3
If you don't ask the camera to rock and roll are you even a real third umpire smh,47
Tripathi's century :(((,1
Nooooo,3
"That was weird. Looked like it bounced after hitting, but doesn’t look like it!!",8
Tripathi hard luck :(,4
Great innings by Tripathi here,6
Yes! That's it.,-1
Nice one and loved the 3rd umpiring today.,6
Gg nonetheless,1
If u slash slash hard,5
damn kkr had such a silent collapse,6
Cricket can be a cruel game. Everyone was criticizing the batting order but even after they fixed it they're now gonna have to count on DK and Cummins to get them to a decent score,14
Oh man. That's really unlucky. Could have easily scored a century,3
3 overs 14/2 damn Lord Thakur is now legit decent. 2020 is indeed weird.,7
Well played Tripathi. Hope they don't open with Narine again next match.,3
Russell is due a good knock and his next game is against RCB in Sharjah...  That is not worrying,9
Cum-mins,1
Pat Cums in D. Karthick,3
"Cummo, bring on the whammo,",2
At one time KKR used to be such a Chad team absolutely destroying opposition. Such a shame,7
"Time for some CumSlog Millionaire

No I will never stop making this pun, I'm too proud of it",5
"Cummins time to hit some sixes now
.. We know he is at receiving end for so many",1
"**16.5** Bravo to Tripathi, OUT, **catch or a bump ball?**. It is a near yorker steered straight to short third man. We go to the third man. The soft signal is out. It bounces short of the bat, and goes off the toe end for a clean catch to short third man. A fair effort by Tripathi, who did his usual Powerplay slogging before selflessly hitting out post PP. Not his fault that Morgan and Russell got out at the other end **140-6**

RA Tripathi c Watson b Bravo 81 (51b 8x4 3x6) SR: 158.82",3
RR traded Tripathi for Uthappa,16
Tripathi deserved a century,1
These cricketers make so much money good lord. How much is a good retirement amount y'all think?,0
Are we going to see Karthik's once in a year hit?,5
Deserved a 100. Comes in from the bench and plays an innings like that. Why would you have him bat at 8?,2
Cummins marry me 😍,0
will the management back DK if he flops today?,-8
Imagine if Thakur ends up being the reason CSK returns to winning ways...,7
Honestly expecting 180 is overkill here lol,8
170 is par score,1
"Somebody go whisper ""Nidahas"" in DK's ear.",2
I really hope those no balls against DC don’t come to bite CSK in the ass. That was such a winnable game,4
I wonder who will break the curse of a KKR batsmen never scoring a century after the first one by Baz.,6
"This is DKs moment to shine , come on Dk we have cursed you enough ,, time for you to prove us wrong",3
"Sakshi : How many ads you are going to act

Dhoni : Yes",12
Opportunity for DK to exorcise his batting demons,1
Everytime i support the underdogs hoping something new might happen but every year it's the same deal. Another MI v CSK final loading,4
Unpopular opinion: Dodgy umpiring is part of the game and is important for getting you into the game.,-5
Dhoni acts better than Siddhart Kapoor in ads,11
[deleted],-4
Why was Jaddu not given an over earlier,1
Narine is KKRs 2nd highest run getter today (till now),5
Tripathi looked like he was playing on a different surface. Great innings.,4
Bravo with 507 T20 wickets. other bowlers in 300s,2
Does anyone know why Jadeja hasn't bowled? Haven't been following IPL too closely.,2
"Serious question, is there a realistic chance that dk might get dropped?",2
DK looks weird without the beard..,2
Thakur is brilliant period,0
This match has perfectly played into the hands of CSK. They are the masters of chasing 150-170. Time to prove everyone wrong DK.,3
DK is looking like actor Dhanush,8
Has anyone notified Karthik he can hit in the air?,2
I don't understand when are these guys hoping to swing it and get some runs... Absolutely shit batting by KKR,-1
Is Curran going to bowl a death over here? Brave if so.,3
What do you guys think would be a good score to defend?,1
dk needs to retire from t20 if he cant score some boundaries here.,8
Tf was that ball,2
bruh curran is very clearly our most important all rounder,7
Thank you Rajasthan Royals for trading Rahul Tripathi for Robin Uthappa❤️,13
Guys if you have so much money give awards to me instead of gliding bots ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯,6
Always with the flamewar tier polls.,1
Can Bravo see that poll result?,2
Cummins playing more as a batsman than bowler for kkr,5
Boss DK should play anchor role here.,2
Cummins showing more intent that dk,5
[removed],-7
Thakur is joginder sharma repackaged,8
"I normally struggle to watch any sport as a proper neutral; there's always something that makes me prefer one team over another

But I'm pleased to say that I pretty much have no preference at all for any of the IPL teams, so I've literally just been enjoying the cricket and the memes with no strings attached and it's excellent",21
"Oh, didnt knew hitting a boundary was allowed.. thanks Cummins!",12
Cumdog Millionaire,7
"Shardul ""appeal at every ball"" thakur on a song today",11
Thakur's in gully cricket mode .. appealing for everything,3
Today Karthik has to prove his worth. It's now or never situation.,3
"Dhoni be like, ""Bruh""",13
That cheeky smile from MSD,8
"Dhoni: bas kar BC.

T: Dhoni thinking who hired kids in my team.",8
Aw that smile :)),2
"Oh no Dhoni smiled, Star Sports about to cum",13
Lmao Dhoni smiling and shardul is like wtf captain let's review,12
LMAO Dhoni's smile at Shardul's appeal,10
Harsha jinxed it lmao.,7
Eoin Cummins,5
Oof patty you beauty.,1
Lol,0
hindi comms are in mumbai or what,2
Cummins opening next match,7
Man this batting line-up is insane,2
Trash finish but he did his job,2
"Lord Thakur giveth, thakur taketh",6
What exactly does dk provide to this team?,0
GOAT CUMMINS has taken his T20 batting to the next level. Huge for Australia.,4
Dhoni is tanned now.,0
Finally thakur revealing his true self. Power mode wore off,-4
Cummins some value for money- every kkr fan who got disappointed from russell throughout the season till now,6
You know you are a good bowler when Cummins smashes you for boundaries,10
lol why have Cummins and Archer been so good with the bat?,7
Karthik once said “Dhoni is the headmaster of the school I am still a student in”. He is definitely following in his Master’s footsteps.,6
Thakur taketh thakur giveth,3
Jofra & Cummins are power hitters from the future,3
"Next KKR match Tripathi & Cummins should open the innings, rest of the batsmen can fuckoff",4
Fucking Harsha...,3
Cummins you beauty!!!,2
why does the shreyas iyer portrait they have look like raina,6
"Why are Australian, English, West Indian tail Enders such clean strikers, while Indian bowlers are such shit at batting?",9
[removed],7
Cummins....you monster...why would you hit thakur on his perfect day😪,10
Cummins and Narine will open next match just watch,4
Lol Dhoni smiled. Star sports gonna have a field day with that,13
"I can't grasp how big this ground is 
 
Some nicely timed ones fall short some go 10m beyond the boundaries",2
"What's with these fake all-rounders making runs this season?

Jofra, Cummins,",8
Unbelievable from KKR in ensuring Thakur’s selection as well while showing us a glimpse of what he is capable of.,7
Do kkr have a replacement keeper?,3
Ah.. Shardul.. You were on the verge of excellence. You were this close.,1
"**Highest Score by KKR opener since 2018**

Lynn: 82

**Tripathi: 81**

Gill: 76

Narine: 75

Lynn: 74

*This is Tripathi's 2nd highest score in IPL. His best-93 for Pune came against KKR in 2017*",6
One of the reason i like dugout because they also don't know if its a six or a catch out.,3
Was suprised to see Curran in that poll for CSK?,1
Dhoni mast,3
Sam Curran not getting belted is absolute travesty this year's IPL,4
"No, DK. You're a conventional player. Stick to your guns.",0
Grandfatherly save,-1
"Kolkata arguably have a batting lineup as strong (and more deeper) as Mumbai but the difference between the two sides is that in one team, everyone exactly knows what their role is and in the other, no one fucking knows what they're supposed to do. This is gonna ultimately hurt KKR at a very crucial time.",10
"A team should have the option to pull out of the tournament lol 

KKR in absolute shambles this year (also KXIP)",-1
Nehra always with his jarring continuous comments on particular player is so weird,1
jadeja specialist bat?,1
"Khud ko champ samajhte ho,

toh champ ban ke dikhao

my11 is ready, aur aapki",2
I just came here to say that Cummins has outscored both Russ and Eoin combined and his strike rate is more than their strike rates added. Something about it is making me lose my shit lmfao,9
Why tf did RR trade Tripathi for Robbie? They traded a younger more agressive Indian keeper opener for an older keeper opener with waning abilities?,9
Has DK played any remarkable innings after that Nidahas final ? I just don’t remember any,-2
ffs cummins hitting the ball better than an actual fucking batsman,1
Current family debate: Sam Curran or Parthiv Patel - who has a more baby face?,2
Tfw Cummins bats better than Russell,3
Think about it.. It's D(ic)K & Cummins,1
Cummins showing DK how to bat,1
comeon DK. one for the team.,2
There is something very odd about Cummins' bowling action,1
god knows how many commentators and star sports officials fapped to dhoni smiling.,7
15.5 crores make you a better batsman than you really are.,12
Next KKR match Cummins gonna open with Tripathi,6
MSD has insanely good field placements,10
Why does it look like that Bravo is being forced to be in the field when he doesn’t want to?,2
"Without DreRus and DK firing, KKR will always look below par despite other good performances.",3
"I'm glad I am not having to endure Slats right now. Cummins is batting, and he would talked incessantly about how handsome Cummins is.

Edit: Cummins is indeed handsome. Just Slats gets annoying. Like Warnie with trying to make Hulk Stoinis happen.",4
What a shit animation. Can’t see shit,2
"Colin Ackermann should have an IPL contract smh my head

Who else has a 7-fer in T20 cricket",3
Bravo batter make all these runs he's lost in bowling & fielding today,1
Harsha please stop jinxing,0
Hope pat uses all his luck here,1
Fuk man,0
Virat Kohli could've been on that list if he didn't keep dropping shit,2
Karthik to Cummins: Look at me I'm the tailender now,9
Shardul looks so much like  Shreyas Iyer. They are both from Mumbai as well.,1
Sam Curran is definitely the better Curran bowler. Doesn't Tom have the highest economy rate?,6
Cummins should farm the strike,-1
He could have tonked it over cover ffs,-2
"> There should be a Rahul of the tournament award. Tough competition xD

Copypasta from CB.",6
Stand and hit. Enough fancy shit.,1
Jadeja just saved DKs season. Lol,8
"Almost Jaddu, almost",8
jaddusdi wale,-1
"Damn Jadeja is missing a few today.


Despite how difficult that catch was",1
"I thought Jaddu would take that as well

Great effort",4
Dk hit a four..... That's one more than russell,13
Jadeja might have just saved DK's career,13
100 points for effort,7
MSD  god tier field placement is [back.DK](https://back.DK) just cant hit it.,2
I guess the shaving tactic didn't work for DK,1
jadeja shot for aashiqui 3 by that expression.,16
"No faf, no catch!",2
That's the first one he's really connected this season,6
Bitter sweet? Lmao who the fuck is this commentator,0
Noo Jadeja normally takes those,6
Just checked the score and lol,1
Retake the all rounder poll and add Patty,7
Jadejas dropped few catches this time,6
Well that didn't last long,5
[deleted],3
Thakur almost made a meal of that lmao,8
Counts as a drop yet half the fielders wouldn’t have made an attempt,8
I would've left Karthik too.,3
Holy fuck Jadeja is such a beast. Almost caught that,9
Jadeja ruining Curran’s figures there,3
Is Jadeja getting old ? /s,2
"Sam Curran is lethal, holy hell",6
Jadeja helping DK save his career,1
Thakur > Jaddu in catching. Peak 2020.,9
Good spell from Curran,5
Fucking shit not enough entertainment no sixes snoozefest,-3
Please Karthik drop yourself drop yourself,1
He drops screamers and catches screamers.,2
Who would've thought Narine would be KKR's best middle order bat today,9
"Karthik should try shaving his pubes next time

Maybe that'll bring him some luck",6
Excellent death bowling displayed here. 34 runs in 4 so far,4
KKR should thank Chahar today.,3
Ppl gotta realize that he missed the catch bc he went for it. Most fielders wouldn’t have even attempted that,6
Kartik giveth and Kartik giveth again!,3
"DK mere bhai, uper nahi, neeche nahi, kaha pe batting kar sakta hai tu?",2
"Dhoni's going to get a fine for the over rate today. So that would be Smith, Kohli, Dhoni fined 12 lakhs each. IPL making a killing with these fines.",8
Clean shave did not change DK’s fortunes,2
Specialist captain coming in at the 15th over and getting a solid 12 (11),9
So no beard didn't help either.,4
guess it's not the beard then.,2
DK struggled this time,1
DK is just not playing well. WHat is he doing?,2
Niceee!!,1
Dinesh 'I dont remember Nidahas' Kartick,3
12(11). How is that a “nice little cameo” Harsha?🙄,3
After shaving DK was looking like Dhanush (Tamil Actor).,2
Lolololol dk ...there’s only so much one can ride the goodwill of that Nidahas innings.,2
Scurran is actually having a gem of a tournament isn't he,4
Someone take us to 175!,2
"**18.6** Curran to Karthik, OUT,  **162-7**

KD Karthik c Thakur b Curran 12 (11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 109.09",2
170 is decent but they could have batted CSK out of the match.,1
Seeing Jadeja drop catchee hurts like a mofo.,3
Every kkr fan : is Cummins on strike?? The only finisher we have in this team,8
Everyone bowled well except Chahar and Bravo,3
Karthik Morgan Russel the overhyped trio no one clicked today still they reached 160+,1
Karthik behenchod,1
Alright Cummins smash 28 off the over like you did Bumrah.,4
Jadeja tried saving DKs career but DK had other plans,11
"Something, something ""fingers up"".",1
"If Thakur would have dropped that, Curran might have exploded! Lol",2
Arrey Jaddu we expect you to take those,2
"I feel like Jadeja tries a lot to make catches look cool for the cameras with his technique, just an observation I've made over time",7
Brilliant death overs innings of 12(11) 💪💪,11
"Hope Bravo can close out the final over.

Have a bad feeling he will try some smart shit and gover 13-15 . Hopefully sticks to Yorkers instead of length balls and slower deliveries",2
if dk has even an ounce of humility he'd take a step back.,5
Cummins above Dk next match??,5
This IPL it has felt like 2 teams are competing for the trophy and rest of the 6 for wooden spoon.,5
Noice,1
Time for Cummins to smash,2
"12 (11) is not a cameo, Harsha.",9
why do all of these hotstar movies look like porn without the sex,6
KKR losing a wicket every 10-15 runs is what made the second half slow,5
I really feel bad for DK. Dude was such a good hitter and even in IPL he was an asset to the team. Now he has become a liability playing ODI in T20. Hope he regains his form.,7
12(11) is not a cameo,5
Brian Lara sounds like he could do some quality ASMR videos,1
Give Watto the over man,2
"The team is good but it is not clicking, Russell and DK need to perform.",3
atleast a bearded karthik can connect the ball.,2
"Dhoni just saying if you concede over 170, we will have to play for NRR.",4
He is going to bowl a slower one first up,1
DK doing DK things,1
"Okay now with that performance on top of that moustache, DK is really making it easy for mangement to drop him..",2
That jio dance is extremely cringy,4
"Problem with KKR is Tripathi bats like DK, DK bats like Cummins, Cummins bats like Russel, Russel bats like Rana, Rana bats like Morgan, Morgan bats like Narine, & Narine doesn't bat at all",15
"GG can be called anything, but he knew when his time was up",6
hahaha. what is that.,1
"Why would you crossover, fucking idiots.",5
PLEASE NO DK NEXT MATCH PLEASE,1
110 min and 1st innings yet to be finish.,2
Why Cummins not on strike,2
Why did they cross?,1
Tripathi really hard carried this innings,3
Lol maari to send off DK ... gotta suck,5
DK not doing anything.,3
"Harsha : Karthik's (12 from 11) lil cameo ends !!!!! 

Wtf wtf wtf !!!",9
Nagarakoti with strike rate of 138,7
Shit. Csk gonna quality yet again for playoffs isn't it??,3
Everyone tryna pull off SKY shots from yesterday,7
What is player's obsession with the scoop shot? It doesn't work like 80% of the time.,2
Bit of a tricky situation for management when your weakest player is the captain,8
Thakur should come at 3 today.,1
Bhogle's commentary is just poop,-14
"Tripathi - 81 (51)
Others - 81 (64)",12
He’s made 11 runs in total. His strike rate of 138 doesn’t mean shit,4
I think Star Sports have gotten enough Dhoni material from this match,5
Kamlesh should taken a fevicol hit,2
Dhoni discussing very vigorously with Bravo as to how long of a test innings he should play today,5
Brave going for 15,1
Happy B'Day Bravooo!,1
Fuck how many catches is that now,1
lmao wat a rubbish shot,2
"What has happened to Dinesh Karthik the batsman, its not like he has any captaincy pressure. He gave everything up to McCullum anyways.",15
Most wicket taker from csk is in 9th position overall.,2
I hope they crossed over,1
"Kkr first purple cap entry is at 20th place, that too an all-rounder, really shows why kkr look good on paper but still struggle",12
Cummins : just gib me freakin strike,3
"Bravo can be nightmarish for tailenders. Especially the ones who are new to the crease, and have to go from the first ball.",4
"It's amazing how often when a fielder drops a catch or misses a run out the commentary is always 'thats a surprise, they're usually such good fielders'. I guess they clearly aren't quite as good as people think because that phrase gets used pretty often.",6
Came late to the match. Who has higher chance of winning? And how Bad is the currant score?,1
Bravo is actually really good when he decides to bowl just yorkers,1
Tripathi batted on a different pitch,4
What a SHIT batting performance by KKR!,6
Won’t be an easy chase. Wicket seem to be slowing.,8
They've derailed somehow has KKR. Narine's boost up put them in a prime position but unfortunately for them Morgan and Russell got out quick and cheap,8
Good guy Nagarkoti providing catching practice,5
This game has been going downhill since the halfway mark for KKR,9
I am so happy 😂😁,1
Is Bravo the James Anderson of T20s?,7
Why is nagarkoti tryin to play like ABD ?,5
Come on CSK now don't fuck this up in the second innings,2
Potential 180+ wasted,9
Why does Cummins have a hump on his back...wtf??,7
"Bowler hits a bad shot

Great minds of r/cricket: Just bat better bro",12
I think we given 15-20 extra runs,5
"**19.2** Bravo to Nagarkoti, OUT, slower ball now, and Nagarkoti mis-times this to mid-off for a catch. At least that bring Cummins to the strike **163-8**

KL Nagarkoti c du Plessis b Bravo 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
Stop jinxing Harsha!,2
"Rabada also had the best economy in that list of highest wicket takers.

Watch Delhi not retain him!",9
N.Jagadeeshan. I feel bad for this player. He's with CSK since last 3 years but was not asked to play even once. I am sure he must have some talent to be selected in that squad.,6
WTF is that hump mister Cummins?,5
Is it time for DK to do a Gambhir?,9
[deleted],2
KKR really suck. I swear I still can't believe we have managed to win IPL twice.,6

Dhoni OP bhai OP...,6
Time to drop ze Captain from the team. Shubman Gill doesn't plays to the merit of the ball. I am sorry but it always looks like that he makes up his mind whats he gonna do before the delivery is bowled. Plays defensive stroke to the overpitched delivery. Tries to hoick or pull the length delivery.,-1

some people just want to hate on Dhoni,20
Would have been really awful if he dropped that because of the glove off. Now it just looks even more amazing because of it,3
Lmao I was actually joking about Star Sports having enough material from this match to jerk off to but I think they actually do have a shit ton of Dhoni material from this match,14
All out.,8

That is a run out!,5
AWWW YYEAAAHH DHONI DID IT GLOVELESS,44
Lol. CSK took 10 wickets today.,6
What a catch by Chacha Dhoni. He is still the best keeper in India isn't he,19

Forget about the wicket. Dhoni saved 4 runs there.,21
Only 39 runs in the final five overs,9

Did CSK's bowling attack do this?  Wow ... I mean wow..,12
Dhoni may not be performing with bat but his wicket keeping is still one of the best,18

Starting petition to bring Gambhir back to KKR as non playing captain.,7
Kkr are gonna need Cummins to bowl out of his skin to win today. Bowling isn't good enough to defend a below par score.,4

Cummins didn't have to crossover in the last over. 😔,5
Can't blame DK for this team performance. This is on all the KKR batsmen.,10
"Wicketkeeping is still top notch!!

It's just the power hitting that has gone down.",11
Bravo turns 37 and returns with a spell of 37-3. Got to love these numbers. Would be cool if he scores 74(37)*,19
But I can't stress the fact enough that death bowling by CSK WAS AWESOME.,11
"Jadhav praying faf, watto and Rayudu to finish this",11
dhoni with 4 catches today jesus christ,11
This IPL |Cummins- 67 Runs| |DK-49 Runs| 😶,38
I mean Dhoni could have played a lot longer in tests. Second only to Saha in keeping and he can keep his wicket and hang around there (which Saha won't).,8
The batsman batting at 8 last match has scored half of the runs today,5
Sending Narine at 4 really arrested their momentum,-12
Without Tripathi KKR would have been total shit,12
Did CSK take more catches today than RCB in the whole tournament?,19
Dhoni is still fitter than some of these youngsters out there.,21
Four catches and one run-out for Dhoni today. Brilliant day at field for MS.,38
They should have atleast scored 190+ after that start.,7
CSK is most welcome to keep Dhoni in the team for the wicket keeping for the next 3-4 years.,16
Choking in the end overs is a sign of a weak hearted team. Should’ve gotten 180+,4
What the fuck just happened. We were 90 odd in 10 overs. I hate this team sometimes.,12
"Thats 58 in the last 7 with Morgan, Russell, and Tripathy. Thats impressive",12
not an easy total to chase. Wicket has some bounce and seems sticky on some balls that are slow and cross-seamed. KKR has a good pace battery. Need a good start for CSK.,11
I want study what is genetically common between Dhoni and Tom Brady,8

Fingers crossed.",2

Overs 1-10: 93/2 (9-4s; 3-6s)

Overs 11-20: 74/8 (5-4s; 2-6s)",13
MI would have scored 220 with that kind of start.,17
This was an RCB level collapse for KKR,19
KKR were 93 in 10 overs. Epic comeback to restrict them,17
I think this is enough to defend against csk. The pitch has slowed considerably than the last game.,3
People keep shitting on Karthik but Andre Russell hasn’t done anything either . And this year he has been given the opportunity to go berserk .,35
We did a good comeback in last 10 because Chawla wasn't there.,7
The amount of people in this sub getting triggered and crying everytime Dhoni is praised is frigging hilarious,48
Tricky chase against a good pace attack,4
Narine is will be the danger and there's no Raina to counter him,2
"Narine gets watson

Cummins gets Faf

NRR gets dhoni

Easy win",20
"Its amazing how many times dhoni has taken full length diving catches this IPL.

Then you remember the times around 2014-15 when he used to let go so many catches between first slip in tests because he didn't want to dive.",17
MSD has 4 catches and 1 run out this innings. Crazy is it T20/Test Cricket.,20
Imagine if Dhoni had dropped that catch without glove.!,9
Tripathi made half the runs on the scoreboard today,7
I will not be surprised if this think tank of KKR consider to open up with Cummins and Tripathi next game. It's one thing to be adventurous but this management takes some of the most insane and stupid decisions.,11
The Dhoni glove removing catch was so perfect. It’s exactly what he wants: make the problem harder so that he looks impressive if he solves it.,-11
"Run from it, dread it. But CSK vs MI finals is always there",45

how often does a team take 10 wickets in IPL?,3
S Curran is literally the one player KXIP needed to make their squad look complete. But now it seems that they’re always a batsman and bowler short.,24
Jadhav is the head of HR in CSK. That’s why he gets ₹7.8 crores for doing absolutely nothing,42
"For everyone jacking off to Morgan, look at his IPL record. I agree he must not be getting ideal time to bat but nonetheless it is very average.",13
This just seems like a day for Jadhav to find his form back.,12
"wow, CSK continuing to dominate the league with death bowling so far. Best economy so far from overs 15 to 20. Who would have thought.",14
Omg i praised dhoni i must be toxic,30
"In addition to their insights, i think Star mainly hired Styris and Swanny to break awkward silences in an otherwise shy Dugout.",12
I feel that we might defend this but this score is extremely disappointing especially after the start they had.,6
As usual Star Sports ignoring Tripathi and wanking off Dhoni.,7
"Chahar going wicketless, only five bowlers used. All other bowlers except Chahar taking at least 2. Other team getting all out. Just wtf is going on",14
"Feeling bad for Abhishek Nayar. He always looks sad and let down by players, no one else seems bothered in KKR.",4
Narine n cummins both 17 of 9 balls with 1 six n 1 four,11
"It's a two paced pitch. And KKR have sneaky bowling unit. They look terrible the one day. But then absolute champ the next day. So, hopefully a good chase. And not like the usual CSK where they bat themselves out of it.

Edit: Well CSK is a hit & miss team with the chase as well. So.. I'm being unfair about their chasing game.",8
"Commentators: Dhon....

r/cricket: Mommy, save me, they are doing it again",46
Dhoni was alive on field today,19
Chennai has to capitalise in the power play. It will become tough to bat later on. So csk depends on the top 3 to win.,3
The commentator sounds like a Chennai ass licker. He's acting like csk already won.,7

Can't blame DK today. He sent everyone as per match situation and came himself at 7. If players won't perform what can he do..,14

"CSK need to bounce back after small hiccup in last match. Play safe in powerplay, respect the dew and watchfully play out oppositions' best bowlers. GO YELLOW ARMY",10
"It's still an interesting chase btw, all depends on how csk start..if you take early wickets , the middle order tends to become extra cautious making the required rate go up to sometimes unmanageable limits..
Early wickets key for kkr.",5
Both Narine and Cummins outscored Russell and Morgan COMBINED.,10
"It seems like it gets difficult as the match progress and the ball gets old. 

It should be a fun chase",1
"Are they gonna rotate dugout or is it going to be Lee Banger Lara and Swann for the rest of the season.

I remember in initial seasons they will have so many stars they will regularly rotate . The likes of G Smith Sangakarra etc used to be so good at their analysis",1

Don't forget Dhoni + Bravo + Curran. This is the kind of total they are quite capable of chasing down the csk way. That is if Watto and Faf have a bad day.,9
If these two don't get out soon it will be another boring chase,2
Make Jadhav to open in rest of matches and give him free license to attack. Maybe he will get a few boundaries in PP. After that he is useless anyway.,3

"Lol KXIP bought CSK into form , now they'll make playoffs",8
"Naaah, Narine should have bowled this one.",1
SEXY Four.,1
Running not necessary. Supreme touch !!,1
That’s a weird boundary from Watto lmao,0
Mavi's action reminds me a bit of Abdul Razzaq,1
Watson has reached double figures. Game over for KKR,9
"Both of these batsmen love pace and have struggled vs Narine, wtf is DK doing",5
"the foreign players really be putting the Indian players' fitness to shame

Shane Watson's nipples could cut through diamond",4
"KKR missed a trick by not opening Narine against Watson imo

Not that I am complaining",3
Four and single. Gavaskar is happy somewhere.,5
[deleted],10
I bet SRK fired Karthik after the debacle of the last match and he came back shaved and all pretending to be a different guy.,10
Longest unbroken partnership?,3
Kkr wtf. You're letting wide watto take a quick single.,3
Faf noooooooo,6
Faf.. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,3
Big wicket that.,3
Mavi is 1 trick pony,-1
"Good Mavi, very good 👌👌👌",2
We have a game now,4
"CSK opening pair can tear this inexperienced bowling attack upfront  
I thought narine would start specially against watson",0
This is just plane garbage strategy. Pace up front to a south African and an Australian on a sticky wicket.,1
Intent ™©,2
Hittable ball but gets a wicket lol,5
"**3.4** Shivam Mavi to du Plessis, OUT,  **30-1**

F du Plessis c &dagger;Karthik b Shivam Mavi 17 (10b 3x4 0x6) SR: 170.00",2
Fuck.,4
Not faf...,1
RIP Francois,-1
No NOT FAF,7
You fuckers jinxed Faf,7
Hehe he we are gonna lose.,1
How did watto get so good since the last match. He looked completely different in the first few matches,4
Now who asking to bring Narine?,4
Is this first time Fafda got a low score this season?,4
Was about to say that these two can do no weong. Fucking jinxed it,5
Thx everyone for jinxing faf into oblivion,11
Can never feel safe with Watson in there.,6
rayudu time,2
Send Scurran you cowards,1
New phonepe ad with amir is hilarious.,-1
Curran?,2
Fuck.,1
One more and they are into tail!!,8
Curran above Jadhav?,4
Mistake from Duplessis chasing a wide one.,2
Who’s next? 3D?,4
Whose that takatak guy,1
Into the tail,2
Faf's wicket is the most important wicket. CSK are as reliant on him as King XI on KL.,6
"Whose is bigger, Dhoni or Watson?",2
I am liking this Mavi lad... such a subtle outseam there.,9
Put on your 3d glasses bois,9
Game on now would be exciting,1
Want to see Jadhav masterclass,11
Looks like short & wide is the way to go for pacers if they want to pick up wicket today.,1
Oy vey,1
Watto pls don't go for the Big shots now,2
Did CSK run out of money to buy undershirts (banyans)?,5
Rayudu's strike rate is lesser than I expected,0
IPLs very own child - Ambati,7
Why does everyone here sound like the same person?,7
From outta nowhere that wicket. So many identical dismissals today,5
That obese uncle from the swiggy ad on hotstar looks like he needs to uninstall swiggy from his phone if he wants to live atleast for another 5 years.,17
Still not convinced by Mavi.,0
As long as Kedar-Dhoni-Jadeja stay in the pavillion it's CSK's game.,15
"We get watto next

We win easy",4
It's easy win for kkr now.,-3
Where did they get so many children to chant for KKR,1
Thirst™,1
Faf was our rock,4
The key to KKR winning will be to make Kedar Jadhav bat as many balls as possible,5
Don't run watto out mate!,1
I like the extra over to the strike bowler!,5
Random Fact- Akshay Kumar was once DD's Brand Ambassador,4
Bringing Cummins again is aggressive!,7
"A good move

Cummins in for 3rd",5
Curran versus Karn,1
Rayudu as usual in giving calls,1
They are going after last recognised pair with their best bowler!!,12
that should've been 2.,5
Village level fielding..,3
[deleted],-1
Lol why did they just take a single,1
I could swear after seeing DK today that he was among the crowd of some Mughal era painting,0
Plz send Curran and Jaddu against Narine and Varun. Just plzzz,0
Narine elevated himself from being a mystery bowler to a mystery altogether!,17
There's been a lot of very village fielding today,3
oh... Rayudu... some free runs for you,1
A close match on the cards,3
"Haven’t seen any sign of dew, so spinners will kill.",6
no Mitchell Starc in IPL?,6
Whatever happened to DK's beard!,6
Sunil Narine's value is going to tank by the next auction,10
Tf Karn opens in Ranji??,2
"Off topic,amateur cricketers of this sub,how to get better at wicket keeping?",1
3D shot!,4
Cumdog redemption arc when? 🙁,4
How the fuck is Cummins so good looking ?,13
Trash tier captaincy. Should have three slips and a gully.,1
"Chahar at 11. Hell yeah, we bat deep. Remember he came in at 4 in one match last season.",11
"Fake crowd is so wholesome

Going ape shit over miss timed singles",13
this CSK team is the ultimate BATDEEP^TM in IPL,10
Petition for tuk tuk dhoni to come at 4 and dot every single ball,9
With the humidity and sweat a reasonable haircut looks like a dead plant on Cummins' head.,6
Rayudu turning down runs smh,5
IPL+ICL legend : Rayudu.,5
Another 2 there.,2
Holy shit that was just 1.,6
This is actually a good powerplay for csk. Usually they do fuck all.,3
Impeccable,1
Good Test for CSK middle order today,0
"He couldn't get wins by changing up the team so DK decided to change up his beard.

Desperate times call for desperate measures",4
jeez Rayudu.... enti ra??!?!?,3
"Commentator: “Two games they have won, their top order has performed”

Me: that’s some analysis dude!",7
"Other teams convert singles into doubles.

CSK converts doubles into singles.",11
McCullums pen skills are sharp.,7
Good job seeing off Cummins. Now kill the spinners Watto,3
Was Cummins staring at DK for not having 2 slips?,5
[removed],3
Drop Cummins.,-5
"Can someone tell how Cummins is 2 million + $$, while Rabada is at 560k, and Bumrah is at 800+k??",5
"so far CSK playing the maintaining rr game   
good too see the engine has warmed up for the old guards",2
Chennai average a healthy 44 in the powerplay this season. The problem starts after it,9
Scott Styris is killing CSK for the missed singles and doubles.,3
Russel may not be his best with the bat but his bowling allows Cummins to bowl most of his overs with the new ball. He's been excellent at the death.,1
What’s the Nohit/Brohit line for Shane Watson?,4
[deleted],0
Kkr fans how much do you miss GG?,-4
Does Mavi bowl another length?,2
Inb4 a jadhav half century and him securing this spot in the team for another 5 years,7
So y'all telling me if i slam my middle finger in the door i'll be as good at cricket and as good looking as Pat Cummins?,7
"Without context, that commentary on Cummins’ middle finger and balls will raise some eyebrows",1
5 overs in both teams 41/1,2
There is low turn out of people on this thread today,5
DK cosplaying as protagonist from V for Vendetta?,0
Just give swanny a free Altroz ffs,2
He could have fuckin saved that',1
Did I just hear a Mavi chant lol,1
Hope they give Swann that Altroz for free.,1
"Cummins hasn't bowled any bad at all, still nothing to show for despite bowling three overs straight. This game is really harsh on bowlers",5
Can Rana run anymore slowly,6
Wtf he could have stopped it with some effort,9
My favorite part of the dugout commentary is Swanny simping over the Altroz every chance he gets,5
"Mavi is one of worst bowlers I have seen so far, bowls one length, so easy to line up.",1
Give swaney the car already. Man promotes it better than anyone else lmao,11
Better fielder would have chased that down,8
ARghhhh!!! Yeaaahhh Daddyyy! Give it to me Daddy!! SIX. Go Daddy Watson.,3
This is so frustrating!! Both bowlers are attacking the same line. Fuck me!,3
Inb4 narine takes a stunner at long on,1
bowling Cummins' 3rd over was a bad idea.,4
Lol Mavi bowling tripe.,3
Uh-oh,3
Swanny plugging CEAT and Altroz in Dugout is hilarious. Deliberately over the top,13
That was great timing too,3
"Mccullum : Dear diary,help me find a batting line-up.",32
What the actual fuck was DK thinking?,1
FFS kick Banger out of the Dugout. Man doesn't know how to commentate.,3
That was just lazy,2
Game over for kkr unless there's a tewatia,4
WatDaddy,1
Never bowl short to Watto... Never.,8
The WatFather,8
Getting punished for bowling that line.,5
Watson apne bhai ka badla lega aaj Mavi se,4
Slapped by Watson.,6
"BC akhand chutiya bowler hai yeh toh

T: this is an unbelievably shit bowler!",2
Mavi and Nagarkoti are not t20 bowlers,4
Games gone CSK going to chase it down comfortably for those sweet NRR gains,6
Where is Nagarpalika 😖🤮,4
Watto back?,6
Mavi learned bowling good length and haven't bowled anything else since,4
Imagine how accurate Mavi could be if he actually looked at where he's bowling.,10
I miss Brandon + Dwayne Smith opening for csk before ban,42
"pumped crowd noise is same for a single and a six. annoying. when you are working and listening to the commentary in the background, it sucks.",6
[deleted],7
KKR should let Morgan captain the side instead of Karthik if they wanna win the rest of the games. This one's already in the hands of CSK.,6
"Watson first 15 balls : SR of 101
Watson after facing 15 balls : SR 191",13
Someone get Watson out so that tuk tuk jadhav can come in and win it for KKR,9
"Fuck off KKR, you can't do shit by bowling 100% of your balls the same way!!",4
do you guys think that rayudu brings in a sense of assurity to this CSK lineup?,19
If daddy bishop asks me to download cred i shall do so,8
Rayudu looks like he is auditioning for test team,-4
I wonder if the commentators have any embarrassment as the advertisers' names roll off their tongues. My least favorite part of IPL by far,1
we never see square cut in IPL,0
Does Swann's wife know that he is cheating on her with the Altroz?,39
People shitting on Kedar haven't been following CSK at all. Kedar's role is very similar to what Badri used to do. His role is to stabilize the middle order if CSK lose too many wickets. If CSK needs to aggressively chase then he bats at around 6. His role in CSK is a floater.,13
Mavi bowling is more predictable than a girl leaving me after 3 dates.,15
"sooo, chased down before 18th over?",9
What's this about cummins' finger? what's wrnng with it?,8
Bring in my mememan Chakrabarty you,5
"Jadhav is there only for you to appreciate Dhoni. If not, we would be bashing Dhoni more.",13
"Watson my boy....
Wtf you arnt supposed to stay this late on ground untill and unless its final...",9
How dumb is DK to bowl 3 overs for Cummins already in powerplay? Should have brought Narine after the wicket to control the runs,10
Who's the bowling coach for Kkr?,3
"No wonder Mavi looks up while bowling, he only wants to bowl one length.",13
So we’re all in agreement that Cummins’ sister slammed his finger because all the guys she brought home went for him instead right?,67
KXIP brought Watson back into form so early in the IPL and now every other team is gonna suffer,25
5 twos converted into 5 singles so far by Rayudu. Sunny is about to pound his meat.,7
"KKR  have now given Pat Cummins three overs in the Powerplay on three separate occasions this year.  This is the only time this season that those three overs have been wicket-less.   


via cricviz",3
Good segment this on dugout,2
[deleted],4
What are the stats for wickets falling after time out,2
"Best CSK opening partnership

Gusset and Vijay

Baz and Smith 

Watto and Faf",8
Watson should be careful of not spending runs from quota of knockout games for league stage matches :d,3
"Wink for us, sammy",1
Fantastic analysis from Scotty there. Can't wait to see if Dhoni can hit those short balls now.,4
This season has brought out the worst in KKR fans. Almost forgot  how obnoxious a part of that fanbase is due to them having been irrelevant for 6 years.,7
Guess they are saving Narine for MSD.,4
[deleted],3
Rayudu's timing is off,2
Varun Chakravarty over Kuldeep is just bad tactics.,1
Rayudu is the last person you would expect to have a neck tattoo,7
DK looks like he wants to act in Maari 3,7
Spin is key this match.,1
"Of all the Indian players who grew Knock-off Kohli beards a few years ago, is DK the first one to shave it off?",2
graeme’s smoked an extra one before coming to work today,4
If CSK win this match they would move from 8th to 3rd in matter of 3 days.... Incredible,7
Wtf happened to Kuldeep?,5
"No idea why KKR bowled Cummins for 3 straight overs in the powerplay.

He would be lethal against our middle and lower order",7
Spinners will probably win this for KKR (I hope),6
"Jesus, even the spinner is attacking the same line. Wtf!! 🤷",8
DK worst captain this season surely yeah?,-2
"1D guy is good enough to milk any amount of mystery spin, especially under minimal scoreboard pressure. 

Bleak here no. Sigh!",1
Kolkata Drop Riders,0
did he just drop Watto?,2
hurry up and get out so I can watch Sam 'makes things happen' Curran,3
Did he drop that fucking catch?,2
It’s like they practice bowling length in the nets lol.,3
Fuck catching that shot lol,6
Wait why didnt he go a step or two in front?,5
Holy shit that almost carried lmfao,6
"I'm not watching, and I may be dumb, but I was under the illusion Narine batted at the top, and specifically as an opener, so he could effectively act as a pinch hitter and nothing more. Today, they send him down to #4, ahead of Morgan. Why?",10
Watson still falling for that ploy lol,4
Watson is like that mine which is end of life and people feel the gold is over but they keep on extending it and finding something enough to keep it afloat every year and even a surprise bonus sometimes.,10
Whys everyone bowling trash short balls on this wicket?,2
Did the fielder not even attempt a catch,8
"Seriously, what kind of a plan is to bowl short to watson?",3
God it feels good to have a real number 3,7
How the fuck did that travel that far :o,6
Do y'all watch Dugout or the other commentary?!,3
The only thing that DK had going for him was that magnificent beard and he shaved it off.,4
Should have dived and gone for that,5
"If I bowl, I will at least get hit down the ground bowling full.",3
I screamed at that sad drop,2
Bring your leggie. Bowl a few yorkers. Do something different. Dafuq is this bakchodi bowling short and on the pads?,2
They really playing GoT theme there?,10
Nagarkoti going to be mauled this over?,4
What a poor attempt at playing GOT music.,6
Unexpected GOT?,5
Game of thrones tune playing in the stadium lol,3
"Smart play by csk especially Rayudu
Single and doubles whereever possible and a boundary to add to end the over",4
WTF game of thrones LMAO!!,10
Wtf? Why is the got theme playing?,6
Test match length to test batsmen. Woah ji woah,6
Playing game of thrones in the stadium?,12
I want a Fleming-Dhoni authored book on their secrets to Franchise T20 cricet,15
"Alright Kamlesh, take a wicket now. I would personally ensure you are selected for T20 WC",5
"Tripati’s feet were bolted to the ground, otherwise he should have taken that.",9
Narine still ghayab. I guess he is a batsman now,3
We need a Rayadu Redemption Thread.,6
Do you count that as a dropped catch with that one where Watto hit it to the square leg??,3
Hey this dude balls full! He will be out of the attack soon.,11
"Bad judgement. Committed way too early.

Looked very catchable that.",9
Rayuduuu,6
CSK are playing so well with all retired players imagine if we actually get a good team in the auction for once like MI,17
Rayudu been using the same shot to hit boundaries since 2018 lmao.,7
[deleted],-3
"Doesn’t Shane Watson look like Jamie Lannister from GoT? Especially the Jamie from the first season. 

It’s funny now that I think about it. It is the same arc. He was considered to be that smug asshole when he used to play for Australia but he is now this wholesome figure for Indian fans in the IPL at the fag end of his career.",7
CSK putting loads of trash talk to the bin since the last match,12
I am sorry to say but this match is done,10
Wear your fucking mask Mr.Khan. These entitles assholes,-7
Damn it feels good to be a gangster - Rayudu,11
where's the best batsmen and part time bowler Narine.,13
"Interesting titbit: When IPL was played in South Africa, Fleming asked Hayden how he wanted to train, so Hayden said that he wanted to surf. And the CSK management gave Hayden the permission to skip training session to surf. Hayden ended up scoring the most runs in that IPL with 582 runs. Since then CSK has given players freedom in whatever way they want to practice (Not completely but for players they deem good enough). 

Some Indian player was training every day and Fleming had to tell him to stop training so much and to relax.",32
"Also this tournament is fucked in the head when after 20 games you have RCB sitting 3rd with 6 points, followed by 4 teams vying for mediocrity, then KXIP, whom nobody really cares about.",-11
No Narine yet?,3
[removed],12
[deleted],7
If I don't get to watch Gayle  hammer some pie chucker all over Sharjah this season I'm gonna be severely pissed,16
"Bah, Rayudu what you dooooo?",1
Rayudu: Please bring me my 3D glasses. Who is the correct point of contact for that here?,4
Oh no full ball almost got a wicket!,2
Rana looks like a gunda,2
Nothing going right for kkr :(,7
Giving up some runs but Nagarkoti still bowled the best over KKR have had,4
DJ really warmed up.,7
Oh yeah nice short ball again,5
There are like 0 2s between rayudu and watson,3
Watson loves short balls.,1
How does Rayudu manage to play like that when he plays one month per year.,8
Haan nehra ji...dikkte rhengi...smjh gyaa...bss ab...sun chuka hu me yarr,-1
"Couple of overs with no boundary, probably a wicket, and things might take a turn..
CSK hasnt been allowed to run away with the game yet.


Is that hoping for too much?",6
DK would have WC semi final flashbacks if that catch is taken,2
"So I gotta ask, is this now the 2019 CSK with bad games with the bat here and there or the 2018 one which most bowlers fear?",1
"Do these fuckers not know Watson is Australian and will feast on short bowling. Also, he is famous for reviewing plumb LBWs.",9
[deleted],-5
"Brett Lee looks a bit off in dugout. All black today too, wonder if it is for Deano",4
"A comment on cricbuzz   


 **anish**: ""Sunil Narine could be more destructive in death overs with big outfield and his variations with the pitch slowing down later in the match. I think this is great move from DK.""   


Interesting perspective",14
Go Daddy Watto!,2
Give it to russell,2
For such a big man Watto does really play that sweep shot well,3
I don't think I've ever seen Watson hit scoop shots before this year. I guess Faf has been teaching him how to.,6
Is Narine playing as a specialist No 4 batsman?,2
Wtf is that field placement?,3
CSK should cruise to victory.,1
Sometimes I feel DK is brain dead. Where is Narine?,7
"Watto coming back to form, nature is healing",5
"KKR need to invest more on Nagarkoti than Mavi. Nagarkoti is truly special. Mavi is good, and can be very good on his day, but he is definitely not special. He's always been a level below Nagarkoti right from the 2018 U19 WC.",0
Un-Watto like.,3
Swanny going over everyone's head with that English banter,1
Narine Ko ball dega ya nahi bhsDK ?,3
"Narine has better figures against csk. Are you gonna bowl him?

DK: I don't think I will",22
Watson playing scoop. Yeah I've seen it all.,5
"Fk kxip for bringing watson to form, it was not supposed to be done until playoffs",7
Who bowls at the death for KKR now that Cummins has bowled 3 overs already . Narine?,6
Bowl Narine you cowards,3
Am I the only one who dislikes the helmet style that DK uses?,2
How has Banton done on drinks duty so far? Learnt a lot?,2
It’s almost too late for Narine now,2
"RR plays like a team without management, KKR plays like a braindead team.",5
Last time I remember DK being good was when he played for MI,2
Wtf is wrong with the Star Sports audio guy? Putting a CSK chanting song in now.,8
Somebody should make a separate thread to talk about Ashish Nehra's commentary.,4
How to rage quit a match as a viewer without breaking the tv?,11
People asking how Rayudu plays this well when he's only around for a month and I'm wondering how he's able to play this well with his eye and well known-problems of depth perception!,4
"Sunil Narine bats shit

*DK: yeah let me make him an opener*

Sunil Narine dismissed Watson 60% of the times

*DK: yeah let me not bowl him till Watto is there*",6
I thought McCullum would do wonders for KKR as coach as I was a huge fan of his tactics and captaincy. But KKR are reminding me of the old Delhi management. Pure knuckle headed decisions.,6
DK talking to the bowler in Tamil is nice to hear,8
"Unpopular opinion but KKR should play only one of Mavi and Nagarkoti. They are both still raw, and KKR would be better off with an experienced Indian pacer alongside either of them",2
[deleted],0
Watson lookin for that squareleg boundary for a long time now,5
why the fuck is every KKR bowler bowling short balls!! I just hate DK's captaincy,2
"FUN FACT:

DreRus has the Best Bowl. Avg., Best ER, Best SR and 2nd most wickets for KKR this season so far.",3
RIP takeitdeepsavenrr: 2020-2020,8
Ball caught his hand there lol,2
I think finally Narine about to bowl,6
"Sometimes I myself forget that Narine's a spinner, to be honest.",2
easy win for csk it seems,4
Why would you hold off Narine until Watson gets settled,6
"I am feeling that this KKR team may not crack top 4. DC, MI, CSK and 4th one up for grabs.",3
That little tap of foot before watson hits six is like watching scarlet johansson in bikini in your pool while sipping vodka martini cocktail shaken no stirred,13
Watson doesn't play any other league in the world ( except for PSL I think) and yet so good when he's in form,5
Hold on Narine hasn’t bowled a single over wtf lol,7
Ah the Chakravarthy.. familiar surname in India now...,7
No Narine AGAIN!,3
DK has been a shit captain this season. With batting line ups and now with bowling changes.,8
Narine has the best record against CSK...,7
Lol Narine last 4 overs I think,4
DK is treating narine as death bowler. Confirm,5
DK trying to finish the game before bringing Narine into the attack,4
"If this is how Chennai play at their worst then I will take them any day. 
- RCB FAN",6
"I remember when Natine was at his unhittable prime, Raina was the batsmen to have hit him for most sixes.  Who do you all remember tonking Narine back in the day.",5
MY GOD HOW MANY POUNDS HAS HE PUT ON WTF,6
"""Guys we need a CSK chant.""  

""OK, how many syllables in CSK?""    

""Three.""  

""How many in Rajasthan?""

""Don't you think that Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan have unique culture and...""  

""Did I stutter?""  

""But...""  

""Exact. Same. Beat.""",12
Dave Hussey has got thicc,7
Kamlesh is so lean. Perfect for a speedster.,3
David vs mike huseey,4
Narine has probably turned into a #4 batsman completely,5
Not giving the ball to Narine or Russell is criminal,5
Only two reasons Narine hasnt bowled yet - DK thinks he is either a specialist batsman or specialist death bowler?,8
Is Narine injured or what?,2
Narine waiting for Dhoni to come realizing match would have finished by then.,7
QUICK^(TM) SINGLE,3
Watto & 3D doing a great job of keeping the scoreboard ticking.,5
Shite fielding is at peak today,1
I thought shaved DK would be smarter  but he just looks malnourished now,6
Darren Ganga asking the question 1 billion people thinking,5
Watto tryna get out,3
LMAO,3
"Yes, keep bowling short to Watson.. great tactics.",5
DK looking like lassie from Psych,2
Even Dave Hussey is baffled why Naraine hasn’t bowled yet lol,10
David Hussey being diplomatic.,3
[deleted],2
Lol Watson's lucky day today,6
Commentators straight up calling out KKR's poor decision making,5
Fuck take those catches ya shits,4
Damn. Mike Hussey has aged really well.,11
Hussey has no answer for the question,9
That fell short. Wasn't catchable.,7
MS is endorsing Go daddy now. Virat pushing us to learn from Great learning. Truly weird stuff. Just give us the old kingfisher surrogate ads,10
Hussey's appearance has chnaged a lot in the past few years,10
We need to have a thread for discussing who's the worse captain: dk or kl,19
Lol switch to English commentary guys they asked kkr specialist why they haven't bowled Narine to Watson and he said it's the captain who decides that,5
"Yeah, more short balls plizz.",2
David Hussey dodging questions like I dodge my responsibilities.,31
"So, the demise of CSK is a bit exaggerated?",10
"Idk about captaincy but DK has the worst hair style out of all captains in this IPL

Edit: Probably ever",5
Wtf happened to David Hussey !!!!!!!,5
Nagarkoti should be top on the list of bowlers who don't look like they bowl 140kmph+ but does it,8
IS THAT DAVID HUSSEY???,7
Yo why does the match bot have an RCB flair,3
"So, DK waiting for the pitch to slow down to bring Narine?",3
Darren Ganga sounds way too much like sanju,3
I feel there is a lack of intent from KKR side.,8
"This is bad captaincy from DK, there was no need to bowl 3 mavi overs in powerplay  or even pat they bowled well but didn't look threatening and now with nagarkoti looks he's Works on a plan made outside ,T20 captainship has to be adaptive",2
Wtf happened to Hussey,1
This crowd noise for mishits is so shit,3
Pretty good strike rotation and a boundary off every over between these two.,1
Is the plan to hold Narine until 10 overs and apply the squeeze? I am afraid  they r running out of time,2
"Why hasn’t Narine bowled yet?

D.Hussey: *I have nussing to say*",12
DK is Dhoni reverse. Dhoni waits to get going until the match is gone when he is batting. DK is doing the same but with the bowling. Russell and Narine will get overs when the game is gone.,3
[deleted],1
"Seems like DK will loose his job soon hopefully not both of them ....actually  don’t know if hopefully or not, would love yadav and banton in the team instead of dk and Nairne",1
"I don't think Dhoni batted the two matches Chennai won.

Edit: Scored.",4
This is gone. Gone already.,1
What is happening behind the scenes at KKR. did Hussey just expose that there is no communication among the coaching team.,2
Rayudu needs to put on some muscle dude just doesn't have the power to hit boundaries consistently.,3
This is painful.,3
Nagarkoti is Peter Dinklage in disguise right?,2
I think the standard should be to bat first against all teams but chase against CSK if a team wins the toss. CSK is MUCH worse at defending than chasing.,2
"Lol wtf commentators trying to help KKR by asking Dave, why Narine isn't bowling to watson who has gotten him out 7 times.",7
Watson gonna end the game the way he is going. Solid,1
"Narine has troubled Watson in the past , today he has not bowled yet. Seriously can someone explain me what is happening?",2
Lmao they said they should just ask srk why narine ain’t bowling cause hussey ain’t giving answers.,1
And that's the match for kkr. Absolute shit in all three aspects,1
Will probably be the 4D chess move of the IPL by DK if KKR win this!,3
10 overs done and no Narine. Such a bummer,1
Narine hasn't bowled a single over? why?,4
dk took crack before this game there’s no other explanation,2
CumDaddy with a hat-trick here,1
"Before the CSKvsKxip game, Joy was on Cricbuzz analysis. He and Simon Doull were asked about CsK top order. While Simon was talking, Joy was seen laughing at the team configuration of Csk. Guess that's not much funny now Joy.",5
I underestimated watson,2
Lmao Cummins to bowl out and still no Narine,3
Shane Watson since his last dismissal: 130 runs in 86 balls,9
Still no Naraine lol,3
The most surprising thing about this IPL is that Koach is only in one ad. Ganguly is in more ads than Koach lol.,7
Has it ever happened in the history of r/cricket that we overhype someone and they actually deliver? All I see are surprised pikachus,4
Nothing is better than Watson scoring runs & his erect nipples.,10
"10 runs good over, Rayudu should stay there till end,both needs to finish this match",1
What the fuck?,1
Not needing 100 from 40 balls feels very good,9
Why is he using pat,3
Wow still no Narine ? What’s DK smoking ?,3
"Damn! Watson said there was something wrong with his technique and that he had worked it out it. I guess, that's the reason he posted in Twitter that CSK's perfect game is coming!",2
Wow.. Cummins to bowl out his quota now :|,5
And we are back to cummins !  Unless Narine is injured - this is getting next level 4d shit from DK,1
This has to be the worst captiancy of this IPL season.,2
DUDE NOT CUMMINS LITERALLY EVERYONE THINKS NARINE SHUD BOWL U IDIOT,1
Cummins bowling out 😂😂,4
The fuck they are bowling out cummins? Is narine dead?,7
"This is very surprising, hard to make sense of the bowling changes and choices",3
Narine's the specialist death bowler today. I think he's being held back to counter Dhoni.,5
That Hotstar ad which shows that missed run out from the first reason makes me realize that current Rohit Sharma ate 2008 Rohit Sharma.,6
Stop Jinxing Watto,0
"R/CRICKET OUTDATED

YOUNG PLAYERS OVERRATED

FOUR GAMES HE WAITED

SHANE WATSON HAS ACTIVATED",5
"If Narine isn't injured, kick out DK as a captain.",1
Wtf DK bowling Cummins out.,5
Guess Cummins not gonna bowl at the death :(,3
Sensible batting?,2
"**Suni Narine**

v Watson in IPL: 28 balls, 29 runs, 4 wickets (Runs per over: 6.21)

v Rayudu in IPL: 50 balls, 41 runs, 3 wickets (Runs per over: 4.92)

*Still hasn't bowled yet*",9
Absolute dogshit. Wake up kkr,4
Don't give a wicket away in this over. Don't care even if it's a maiden.,1
So is there something with the pitch here which doesn’t favor spinners like  Narine & Jadeja?,1
"Yes, SRH was required to bring Watson back to form. But because it’s 2020, there was a one match delay.",2
DK CHUTIYE DUMBFUCK,3
"I think dk is going with the plan to take quick wicket here. He prolly thinks that if they a wicket here, csk are done for.",5
KKR is just so moderate in everything.,4
If Naraine is injured why the hell would he be on the field. He is arguably their worst fielder,6
They are going to see Cummins off and go at others.,7
I know this game might not go till the death but if it does somehow who tf will bowl there?,7
DK turning into Narine,3
Old or new ..both DK are dumb.,9
DK seems clueless here,5
Dinesh Karthik looks like Karthik Kumar (comedian) with this new look lol,3
This match is done done. CSK don’t capitulate even in a big chase. The just don’t score fast enough and show no intent. Needing 78 of 59. Even if they get wickets. Jadhav and Dhoni tuk tuk would still win them the game.,8
WHY TF THERE is no option of neither of the looks,7
r/cricket neither,6
"Imagine finishing your best Bowler in the 11th over. 
Captaincy level : DK",9
Wtf is going on?,3
Don’t take risk against Cummins . Just play him out pls Watto,7
DK with the sage beard > chikna DK,5
Some extra-dimensional chess going on here,9
that's the Poll question? Lol,9
Old look. Anyday. It was a glorious beard.,7
"I’m sorry, DK isn’t chuckling at the screen",6
Is Narine injured? That's a possibility,2
This should be the most lopsided IPL poll ever. Who tf prefers the current look of DK?,5
Strange decision by KKR by still keeping Narine in the pocket. Thought he should've bowled an over at least by now.,5
The one time CSK lost after a Watto 40+ was in the final.,4
this is at a point where jadhav can just accumulate runs and win,2
Narine should have bowled during the powerplay itself.,3
McCullum doesn't know cricket.,2
Wtf are these polls man,5
lol cummins bowled out with 9 overs to go. DK' s gotta go!,3
Narine successfully following in Smith's footsteps to be playing as a batsman now.,4
"I understood Dhoni's decision to bowl out Chahar early cause he had a shit day, but why is Cummo being given the same treatment?

Him and Russ at the death could be pretty good... vs Mavi and Russ or Narine and Russ",4
Hot take: people here have a hate boner for csk and especially msd and people pretend like csk is over but the truth is csk's demise has been greatly exaggerated.,3
Why won't he bowl Narine????,2
Narine is giving DK the silent treatment for dropping him from the opening position which is why DK can't ask Narine to bowl.,9
DK looking like discount Dhanush,11
DK went from godlike beard to that weird ass dude from the Phillips trimmer commercial,8
Lmao at this point its just a contest between kohli dk and rahul to see who the worst captain is,-1
"KKR really suffering in the pace department , it's high time they bring in lockie for next match to put pressure from the other end...they are not using Narine for bowling properly as well.",2
DK went from looking like a Bad Ass Thalaiva to the guy who asks for Bobs and vegana pics from white girls.,9
Imagine commentators are having a discussion about the captain's look rather than worrying about his incapabilties.,11
Danny Morrison promoting an online vote about cricketers hair styling is peak IPL,5
these polls are embarrassing... the way the dugout isn’t even acknowledging them lmao,7
Who’s the new KKR wicket-keeper? Is DK out with an injury or something?,3
Hindi Commentary has stopped talking about the game now.,5
This week on *Captaincy for Dummies...*,12
What the fuck was that poll lol,8
"Narine to bowl 12, 14, 16 and 18.",10
Inbefore Narine comes and does mayhem.,8
"I seriously doubt whether DK uses his Captaincy(or his brain) or not? 

Looks like he was given instruction manual and he's sticking to it without looking at the Situation of the game.",9
Scenes if Narine picks up couple of wickets lol,4
"Irfan Pathan: We used to talk about the crowd between overs.

What Pathan *really* means: Londiyon ki baate karte the...

Trans: we used to talk about girls.",8
"Go on srk, fire DK on live tv. Make this match memorable.",5
Loving Narine's transformation from mystery offspinner to pinch-hitting all-rounder to specialist no. 4 batter who doesn't bowl,4
"Even if Karthick didn’t wanna bowl Narine initially surely the dressing room would have sent a message to give him a try considering his record against us .

Just bizarre",5
"Lmao, IPL guys are so bored they're putting a poll on DK's facial hair.",13
CSK is in a comfortable position. They should start playing their shots,5
37% voted for the new look. Wtf,9
Harsh call?,1
Ngl would love more polls like that,1
 like seriously! Imagine having such a good start and shitting in the last 8 overs,6
Hold on someone said there’s some tussle between DK and Narine?,2
"Hahaha omg, umpire yelling WIDE",3
Waiting for Narine to come in and get smacked,8
[deleted],7
[deleted],6
Phew... done with Cummins,11
"If it's not a messed up batting order,it's a messed up bowling pattern. There's always going to be one with KKR",1
Two Million dollar man seen off,1
"Where are all the arm chair ""bro CSK fucked last place old washed up"" experts now? You're not laughing now are you 😪😪",2
Did DK lost the plot by not bowling Naraine against Watto so far?  Watto already did the damage expected out of him.,3
About to get crushed here and they have time to discuss if the new look is good or the old!,3
Why narine is not bowling? I don't understand kkr tactics,2
DK shaved his facial hair in the hopes that SRK won't recognise him when the latter comes to tell DK that he's being dropped from captaincy.,6
CSK looks damn strong all of a sudden,6
"Even if KKR win this somehow, Eoin Morgan needs to be captain",2
So KKR strategy is basically to let Watson settle down and in form and then let him face Narine.,6
Dhawan is a mother-lover 😳,2
"Even if they play out Narine at run a ball, they'd need 50 off 30. Which is more than gettable.",4
Iyer had immediately brought in axar to get rid of watto and it paid. Surely narine should have bowled in pp,3
Where is narine,3
Gambhir must be really in a mood rn,6
"Damn, you can put CSK down but you can never keep them down can you?",10
Can Narine do a Thakur,2
"KKR job is too big for McCullum, DK and Kyle Mills.",-1
What's the soundtrack of the boat ad?,2
And now he comes in lol,2
Narine 5-fer incoming,4
Finally,2
I'd rather move to Pakistan and download and use TikTok than use this Josh app.,2
"DK going to go out with a bang now, will bowl russell into the ground and destroy the young pacers confidence....wait we see a wild nairne at the crease",-1
Hugeeeee test for Narine,3
DK probably thinks it's a ODI and not a T20,2
"I know narine is not in best of his forms, but imagine being him today.. getting demoted in batting,no bowling till the 12th over, that's the mental stress which many cricketers complain about I guess",3
Atleast these BOAT ads are not cringe,1
Ayyyy here he is,1
In before Rayudu smacks Narine out of the park,3
DK brings Narine now to get slaughtered.,2
Sunil Narine is all about mystery,4
"11 overs done .

RUSSELL and NARINE have 8 overs.",7
What’s more frustrating? CSK doing this right from 1st match but then losing the fizzle towards the end or the other round?,4
Incoming 20 from this over or 1,4
"At this point whatever happens, I really hope they send Curran in next",2
Will Narine bowling so late be a genius or stupid move?,5
Rayudu giving no fucks lol,10
Narine is here guys,3
Did Ambati play domestic cricket after the CWC?,6
Nice fielding by the big man,8
Would love to see Narine beaten around the ground for all the hubbub.,5
Russel injured confirmed.,8
"Isn't it mysterious how after that one tweet from Watson, CSK has turned into one heck of a team? O.o

Watson making it obvious for us. 😌

/s",11
Experts said that KKR needs a change in their captaincy. So Dinesh Karthik shaved his beard.,27
Just heard KKR's replacement US bowler Ali Khan also gets injured. Is that true?,5
"Here comes the man, the myth, the death bowler.",7
we sure any finger spinner who plays for KKR doesn’t chuck...sometimes for specific balls . I think they do,1
"DK bowled out Cummins and has Mavi, Nagarkoti and Chakravarty at the death 😭",8
Are we gonna see Dhoni smash some today or can I go to sleep now?,6
"All the pessimists out there, the move to hold back Narine must have some thought behind it. Why can't people just be patient?",20
I was so looking forward to this match.,5
WAITING FOR FINISHER TO FINISH,2
Should bring in Russell next. He has been economical. And the two pace nature of the pitch should help someone like him.,3
The virtual box is the most cringy thing I've seen in IPL,12
"I feel like Kedar Jadhav should just get an affidavit done and change his last name to Yadav, because I don't think these commentators are ever going to call him Jadhav, he should just embrace it.",8
I swear if you guys jinx the game 😡,4
All those virtual guest box chaps look like they are on biryani diet which only means over thing.. 😎,2
God virtual fan box is 10/10 cringe,10
Need some stats. Has Narine been as effective as he was before the action change?,3
Still remember Sunil Narine coming to bowl and getting George Bailey in his first ball of IPL 2014 final,8
Bizarre tactics.,3
Only logical reason for Narine not bowling earlier I can think off is KKR expect the wicket to get a lot slower as the game progresses and so held him back,7
"Past 12 balls, 9 runs.

KKR back in the game bois",4
Is that DK talking to Morgan for.... Advice?,5
Get MS on the crease. Only chance KKR are gonna win this.,12
KKR can save their season in only one way. Drop DK. Make Morgan the captain. Give the gloves to Tripathi.,5
They should send Bday Boi Bravo to finish the game. He hasn't batted in the tournament,3
What happened to that leg spinner from WI who was t20 specialist ? Can't remember the name,3
This will be a big over for CSK,2
"Cummins bowled out in 11th over, what is DK thinking",3
"This match is done unless MSD and Kedhar decides to play Test cricket.

If KKR somehow get these 2(Watto & Rayudu) out, it could be interesting.",9
"CSK need 2 off the last over

Dinesh Karthik brings himself into the attack, and bowls a triple wicket maiden. KKR wins by 1 run.",19
Hope we don't slow down like KKR did :/,2
Mavi and Nagarkoti are more Umesh than Bumrah lol.,3
Lara straight on the money with his wicket prediction,3
shiiit i smell a tewatia from DK here,4
Friggin Brian Lara still got it lol 😄,3
Oh shite,1
Dhoni pls,2
"Rayudu definitely needs more muscle, he's only a 2D player atm.",5
Damn Rayudu,3
Not Jadhav not.Jadhav,2
I reverse jinxed the game. Fuck we lose.,8
Lara killing it with his predictions.,2
Lololol Rayudu,1
they should bring curran here,1
Oh no....shit!!,2
why do indian commercials have kids in them more than western ones. Interesting for human behaviorists to study.,2
MSD walking in at 4,4
If Fucking Jadhav comes in now.,1
Good captaincy from dk!,3
Thala pls play fast thala,1
Wicket alerts are awesome hahaha,6
"Eren Jaeger

Kedhar Yadav",2
Stop comparing GOAT Pollard with Russell.,7
Jadhav Jadhav Jadhav Jadhav,3
"Dang, Dhoni at 4",4
Fun Fact: Dhoni has never hit a four against Sunil Narine,3
4D move by DK by not bringing Russel,7
Curran or JTFO,5
Dhenier pls score,2
"Holy shit, Brian Lara was spot on wicket prediction",1
Scratch what I had said previously.,1
"Oh no!!

Dhoni is going to dot up Narine!",5
Dhoni at 4!!!,1
"Wait, is Dhoni walking out?",5
Nagarkoti fanboying SRK after the wicket. Nice boi!,3
Tf Dhoni against Narine. Omg we fucked.,7
Holy shit it’s Dhoni coming in at 2 down,8
It's apocalypse bois. It's Dhoni time,11
Dhoni!?,6
Oh no.,4
Ah fuck... It's Thala time,6
**THALA** is here.,6
CSK tail starts.,2
Ambaaati why. Should have stayed till end.,6
Dhoni it is!,3
did the sun rise in the west today,3
Was there some exchange of words?,2
"lmao every time i tune into dugout and they bring out the wicket alert, a wicket falls",4
"**12.1** Nagarkoti to Rayudu, OUT, wow the bowling change works. What do I know about cricket? Rayudu has found long-on with pinpoint precision. Short of a length, not much remarkable about the delivery except that Rayudu decided to pull in the air. Long-on says thank you very much **99-2**

AT Rayudu c Shubman Gill b Nagarkoti 30 (27b 3x4 0x6) SR: 111.11",4
"So, MS is on the crease. Now KKR will win. 👍",3
Brian Lara why did you have to call Wicket Alert :(,2
Dhoni??? That's a surprise,2
Dhoni in 6 overs too early.,2
"Dhoni def gonna walk in. The match has already been won. Would up his PR by making it seem that he does come up the order when the team needs him. Fucking cunt.

If 89 was needed of 47, the fucker would come at 8.
Would send the whole team up and come when the match was unwinnable so you can blame the top order.",-9
If Watto gets out. We should be worried.,1
dhoni better hit out no settling in bs,1
"Cummins, Narine. 2 quiet overs. And the youngster gets the reward",2
"Narine and Chakravarthy vs Dhoni. 

*You have my interest*",9
Surprise surprise. MSD,3
Suggest a srk song for Dhoni. Go!,3
Dhoni should play like he has done in the previous games this IPL,7
Now I can see the capability of Cummins,3
MS has to contend w 3 overs of Narine now,8
"If watts goes now, KKR will win.",2
Incoming last over 25 runs needed,8
Oh Lord save us!,0
"Everyone is complaining about Dhoni. But just remember, he’s retired from international cricket. We are fortunate to watch him bat, won’t see too much more of this",5
Save this comment. Dhoni is going to win this for CSK,5
Captain Morgan forming a coup,9
Dj stop playing stupid songs,3
Wow,1
"Dhoni vs Narine: 59 balls 27 runs 2 outs.

Yet to hit boundary against him in IPL.",11
"Dhoni Vs Narine
OH NO",5
Bhogle just said Dhoni will take time to settle in,7
Y'all thought DK shaving his beard was the biggest twist of today but while DK is playing 2D chess Thala is playing 5D Chess with Time Travel.,7
Only Dhoni can save KKR now.,8
Morgan literally seems to be the captain lol,5
When was the last time he wore a half sleeve shirt?,5
Dhoni will take this deep,7
dhoni in at 4.. surely i must be dreaming,8
Dhoni vs 3 overs of Narine,7
Tuk Tuk Slowni activates.,5
Didnt they change ends? Why is MSD on strike?,2
Get him out quickly.,3
Kedhar Jaeger should come to bat,7
Right in the minor kunju,13
Thalaiva neengala,8
Dhoni starts slow 🤝 Narine slows Dhoni down.,10
First ball into Dhoni's dong,8
attacking his pp bold move,11
Great incoming required 50 from 3 overs,6
Oh no dhoni nuts,5
DHONI HAS NEVER HIT A BOUNDARY OFF NARINE,11
Dem nuts,7
Thala sacrificing everything for team,14
Ball hit Dhoni's samaan.,16
Right in the baby maker. Oops!,7
Dhoni got a 3 ball problem,4
Dhoni bowled!!,-2
That will wake you up,10
"Now that the target is easy to get, Dhobi is out to bat. If not, he’d have come after Piyush Chawla. Best finisher indeed.",3
Damn bruh that’s a dick move,11
Bulls eye by Nagarkoti,11
Looks like watto and MSD has become best friends,11
Right in the Dhonuts,28
I dotn get why KKR havent  given Prasidh?Sandeep warrier a chance. Those bowlers are furhter in their development than Mavi. Good pace means sometimes that it reaches the boundary faster in this format.,0
These last 7 overs are going to take an hour aren't they,10
High IQ tactics by Thala to have already fathered a child before getting hit in the nuts.,13
Dhoni with the post nut clarity now,22
two youngest players in the match Nagarkoti and Gill didn't even celebrate one of the biggest wicket. Maturity beyond years or have they already given up?,4
Dhoni averages 91 this IPL. Surely a successful one according to his fans right?,22
Dhoni's 'thala' got a nice beating.,16
Thalas nuts under attack,20
what's the point of playing Jadhav? just play with another bowler ffs,16
Things getting awkward in comm box ..,8
"Yo heard from Twitter this the first time KKR elected to bat first since 2015. 69 matches ago.

Pretty insane, but nice.",20
Ah yes. Right in the baby maker.,13
should've just let Scurran do the job.,5
Thala showing intent ™,12
"Dhoni in, Bois grab ur popcorn for a last over finish",17
I thought you had to start jumping if you get in the nuts,7
Dhenier started,1
I N T E N T + P A S S I O N,5
Alright boys get read for some nice deep game.,7
"""slash and slash hard""",2
Lund before wicket.,5
Right in the Dee-eye-see-kayy,3
Nagarkoti hitting the Gotis,5
Dhoni showing intent with that slash,6
"someone get the chunky monkey out please.
Jadhav is the need of the hour for CSK",4
Intent from Dhoni? Wow!,3
Morgan to DK: Look at me I'm the captain now,24
Sara looks at her dad for approval as Gill takes a catch in the deep.,12
"I can hear the groans in the commentary box, ""but I'm okay with it."" rofl",8
"Post nut clarity bois, that’s what was missing",4
Now thala will hit ball aiming at bowlers nuts to assert dominance.,3
jadhav has been so horrible that dhoni decided to promote himself,8
17th place lol,2
"Req Runrate is 9 when Dhoni came in

Let's see how much high he leaves it at his wicket or 20th over.",10
INTENT^(TM),4
'I can hear the groans in the commentary box' lol,15
I am ready for a classic Dhoni start of 6 (17) before accelerating,12
CSK been losing the plot in these last 2-3 overs.,4
This man got hit on the nuts and looked slightly uncomfortable at best... Wtf!!,4
7D CHESS By dk introducing Narine later as he know dhoni will come 2 down and Dhoni's record is not too good against Narine.,10
Great over this from the you gster,3
"Kkr lost the match, they don't know yet.. /s",5
"""strikes Dhoni on the thigh""

Cricbuzz",10
Kamlesh Katakuri : Dhonuts!,3
Number of people who are online in this subreddit gets a jump when dhoni steps in. Anyone noticed that? People drop by just to shit on this guy.,9
Need Watson out now for some real Dhoni fun!,7
CSK - I know he is your captain but you can't seriously like him as a bloke.,6
yo we gotta start hitting that run rate is creeping up,5
"Honestly I hope Dhoni finishes this off and ends 40*(27) or something just so people can stop making the same shitty jokes over and over about playing for NRR

I'm not even a big Dhoni fan or anything, I just want the match threads to stop being shit",29
"I love the fact the Dhoni has promoted himself up and is not holding back. This is what we all asked for, didn't we?",18
Watson is here to close this on his own,4
Dre Russ to bowl,3
We are in need of a close match. The last week has seen very routine matches.,12
Go on Morgan,7
"CSK fans : ""Ah no need to worry, we still have enough batters"" 

Dhoni : ""I'm gonna make a pro gamer move""",34
"10 runs in the last 3 overs and the pitch is slowing up

Going to be closer than we think",10
This match is going till the last 3 balls no matter what is the result. Dhoni means thriller guaranteed.,25
"Nagarkoti, Mavi, Tyagi - good pipeline of quicks for India.",12
Boundary of this delivery?,4
Wait they are bowling full to Watson!,6
Tuk tuk Watson,6
I hope Watson gets his credit today as well,6
How tall u think Koti is?,3
Nervous 40s Watson,4
"Lovely, Nagu. Lovely bowling. Beautiful rhythm.",7
"This is going to be a last over finish, isn't it?",14
Those trumpets are going to haunt me for years,4
"So dhoni conveniently pushes himself up the order when it's a easier chase and pushes himself down the order when it's a harder chase

Shouldn't it be the other way around?",7
"Only 10 of last 3 overs and now they have fucked themselves.

Why!!!? Should have won this, but now with 3 of Narine vs Dhoni and Watson. Impossible",4
Time to take it deep^TM bois,3
20 year old Indian pacer hitting Dhoni in the groin on his first delivery... only in the IPL,9
"Dhobi is a hypocrite. He has come out to bat because target is very achievable, he only *finishes* these kind of games.",-12
Will be interesting to see these too play against Narine,2
Nagarkoti next Sreesanth,3
"Well played watto, good to see back on form.",1
Nice one Watto!,1
"Which sounds more made up?

IPL Fairplay Awards, or

Boost Stamina Meter on cricbuzz",7
Well done watto!,3
WATTO YOU BEAUTIFUL SEXY BEAST.,3
Possibly a naive question as I haven't historically watched loads of IPL. I'm assuming there's nothing stopping them just switch Morgan to captian? It's not set in stone or anything?,7
Nagarkoti > Mavi. Dude at least looks at what he is bowling.,5
Dhoni has already retired.. what do you haters want now? He really cannot play like young talents.,10
Nagarkoti has bowled 2 good overs. The first one went of 7 runs and the last one for 2.,4
"Guys, when does the mid season transfer window open?",6
Say what you want but DK has brought the best out of Nagarkoti and Mavi last few games,8
Nagarkoti looks like he has an issue with his MYSQL DB.,10
Playing dots in infectious. Issued in public interest.,1
Could use a Dhoni special 30(27) here.,1
Damn dhoni looking scary in that ad,3
Combined age at the crease 78. Magee koti is just 20 bowling to them.,7
"No matter how talented these youngsters are, you can't lead a bowling attack with 3 inexperienced players.",4

"DK saving Narine might actually have been a brilliant move...

Also Nagarkoti was excellent today.",10
"66 needed of 7 overs with Narine still having 3 overs left. I don't see how this is ""easy"" Chase.",8
"**Dhoni has NEVER hit a boundary off Sunil Narine in IPL**

Anyone feels they've had Covid mostly asymptomatic and now life seems different with foggy brain?,10
Kedar Jadhav is the first specialist fielder who is not even that good at fielding.,17
"I don’t think Dhoni himself has a clear idea of where he wants to bat.

It’s weird. I know people change the batting order depending upon the position. But with him it’s like you have to ask yourself- ‘what is his role?’ Does he see himself as a finisher or someone to bat in the middle overs?",4
Koach - Bevda - Banger (aka PIG 3) didn't allow Thala to come and bat at no. 4 in the CWC so Thala gonna do it now and prove dem haters wrong and take revenge on NZ by humiliating McCullum's team.,4
Dhoni has been doing a Tewatia even before Tewatia first started playing cricket and he is still the same!,9

NRR saved. Hopefully we are going deeeeeeep. Just get watto out. Dhoni and Jadhav will take it to last over for Jadeja to win it @ the end. #jinx,4
Lmao the promos for RCB vs CSK have already started,4
Dhoni's here and so is my anxiety.,1
Taking the game deep boys!!!,4
Last dominating performance from KKR i remember was last year against us at Eden Garden.  That's what KKR can do on their best day.,2
Dhoni is great at not getting out. So they can hit around him. It is good strategy!,2
Dhoni has always struggled against Narine. KKR probably saved Narine's overs for the same,5
The timeout was longer than expected,2
Final over might need 26 runs to win lmao,3
hopefully dhoni has the slog bat out,2
Nice seeing dhoni coming out to bat,4
This is going to be an interesting match,1
He likes teasing us... LMAO,1

Why did Watson review that,1
Out,0
Called it,2
Why the fuck did he need Ultraedge for this?,7
Umpires call?,1
That's harsh.,-1
There should be an XI with the most punchable faces. Watson and Warner would be my openers,-3
Watson would review clean bowled if he could,2
WHy does he need ultra edge🤦🏾‍♂️,3
OMG WHAT THE FUCK I THOT THAT WAS MISSING CLEARLYYYY,8

No jadhav pls,2
good I want a close match today,1
"Good thing they used ultra edge there, was a real close one",5
People said Watson is back when he carried his bat last match.I say Watson is back because he took a failed review.,8
Okay now Dhoni coming in is bad!,1
"I don't blame Watson. Most of the times those are given not out. Anyway, the review is still intact.",3
sam just needs to get the run rate up,0
"It was missing leg, i don’t see how the umpire can give that.",4
Oh fuck who made the neighborhood boomer uncle third umpire,3
"for some reason i dont see csk choking, ever",2
DK was a genius. I just couldn't see it at that time.,1
Would've loved to see MSD + Kedhar. KKR too would've loved that.,5
Dam good decision,2
FUCK,1
Curran please,2
Sachin has once again tampered with DRS I see,3
So CSK are indeed showing intent. Sam Curran and not Jadhav!,2
If only DK 🤡 used him early,0
This is cheating. Why send Curran.,5
"Dhoni: Watson will strike and I will play support and we win. People will praise me.

  


Watson out, dhoni: fuck",2
"Ah, if Kedar had come out this game was over.",1
"Narine doing bits here, maybe they had a plan all along and as i type that i see ratty curran coming out, could be the game here if he slaps a couple of boundaries",3
For the first time I saw little bit smile on narine's face,8
Sam Curran has really got some backing from management ..,2
You guys are seriously underestimating Dhonis capability.,3
Bruhmoment from the 3rd umpire right there...,1
They got a settled batsmen out. 2 new batsmen at crease. Why the fuck are KKR not happy? Settle your issues amd Play like a fucking team.,2
Bravo birthday knock incoming,2
Looks like SRK offered to dance at that umpire's marriage reception,4
"How many times does it need to be proven that /r/Cricket is not better than the professionals.

Keep your hot takes to yourself.",12
Fucking Scurran let's go,4
Lol this match is going deeeeep now.,1
Surely Narine is too much for Curran.,2
They asked me to save the trees and I smoked weed today with bhujia sev for flavor.,1
Curran about to do to Narine what Narine does to spinners,1
Watson surprised while walking off as he does not see 3 reds after the review,2
Dhoni and Watson look like pehelwaan bahubalis,2
Curran in to slog.,1
"CSK: ""We don't have any youngsters""

Chad Narine to Virgin Curran,5
F for Jadhav. Literally why is he in the team?,2
"MAKES

"As always ""LEG BEFORE WATSON""",3
CSK gotta hide Jadhav as much as possible. Maybe send him after Thakur,1
CSK bottle incoming,2
Watson getting out lbw and Dhoni playing like he has in the recent past and this  doesnt look too different from  Test  Cricket does it?,1
Fish... I want fish. Haven't had seafood since lockdown 😔,0
Inb4 dhoni 36 of 7,1
KKR needs one more wicket before they get their match winner Jadhav in,1
"Now, the quick 2s will pile up.",3
"Fasten your seatbelts boys...we're in for a 20th over chase now...
NRR...standby as close a possible
Jaddu keep your sword ready for if jadhav decides to finish it in 19th...or 21th you never know of him",4
Quick running finally,4
Dont choke this innings CSK!,3
"Req rate up to 10, oof",2
Only Sam Curran can win CSK the game from here,4
Part of me wants dhoni to fail at this chase.,1
"Shit dhoni runnings 2s, prepare for the extra 15 mins",4
At this stage KKR 109/3. CSK 101/3 ..... Damn this game is getting tighter,7
"Uh oh, Sam Curran is here",1
"That was such a slow ball, why couldn't Watson get a bat on it?",5
 No Kedar. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.,8
Watching Watson run and now watching MSD run is like night and day,12
Jokes aside this is working out for dk to be honest. Narine still has three overs and dhoni always struggled against narine. They also have nagarkoti and Russel two of their most economical bowlers,9
Dhoni is like the Indian flash. Man runs fast for a 40 year old,9
So that's 8 times Narine has gotten Watto?? And Dhoni is like 40 runs from 75 runs against him??,8
Dhoni is fast boi,6
"After this, off the 6 overs, 4 from Narine and Varun Chakroborty",6
"there can be only two reasons for jadhav not coming

1) csk knows he would mess up the chase

2) he pulled his hammy",5
"Speaking of Curran and his bro, remember Albie and Morne Morkel?",11
Next over Russell!!,1
Hope the game is good to watch bois,3
"If everyone is in the bubble, why that woman sitting below Khan is wearing a mask?",4
Dhoni is buffed bruh. The muscles dont lie.,8
WE CAN'T PLAY OUT 2 MORE OVERS OF NARINE,4
Ooooo rr almost at 11 this might be good,1
Ahhhhh boi narine!! Time to get back into this,1
Mahi ki Paheli,1
This is the match 160s chasing interesting,4
Rip CSK,4
"It's going to be one of those matches, isn't it",4
"Ah, things are back to normal I see.",1
Even Dhoni knows that Sam Curran will be better than Kedar Jadhav.,5
Think Jadhav is one of the Infinity Stones..,3
MS SR watch: 25,1
Strong feeling that someone recommended reddit to franchises mid season and we are finally getting to see what we all wanted,3
welp gg we lost,5
"We are on the way to lose this match, aren't we ?",3
Why does Jhadav exist?,1
"CSK: *exists*

Narine: Stonks 📈",8
KKR could have brought Narine earlier and made this match much more easier.,1
Narine does everything in slow mo. Maybe that's his bedroom game too.,5
RR just climbed to over 10. Only CSK,2
Dhoni dotting up against spin is so good to watch... attrition in T20 only Thalla can do it,1
Why does every Dhoni innings versus spin start with a backfoot punch to short cover. Jeeeeeeeez.,4
RRR creeps past 10..,1
"14/2 in the last 4, absolutely brilliant man",8
"Stuff like MS Dhoni + Sam Curran partnerships is truly why I bother to watch the Indian Meme League

Undeniable entertainment as a cricket fan",6
Ranveer singh is by far the cringiest dude ive seen,7
Dhoni will wake up when its 15 rpo,4
Dhoni is gonna take this to the last ball Bois,2
MS has never hit Sunil Narine for a boundary,7
"I have never had any doubt

When my fave part of IPL comes about

Now please don’t get shirty

For just two minutes thirty 

CEAT tires strategic timeout",7
"wtf is Narine injured, why was he walking like that?",1
Ffs Dhoni take singles for once,7
RRR will hit 12 soon. Classic CSK,9
What do you want me to do? A) take another 20 balls to score 5 runs or B) win the match,2
Why is the audio guy playing massive cheers for a Dhoni dot?,6
Interesting! Both spinners,2
I miss hearing : *ROLL IT BACK ROLL IT ROLL BACK BACK BACK YEAH BACK BACK BACK BACK*,4
Please take advantage,2
r/cricket is jinxing Curran real bad :D,5
i smell a cheeky rana over here,2
Ayeee my man gautam vermaaaa,1
[deleted],9
This game just turned on it's head,2
What the hell happened? CSK were coasting? I stepped away for a few overs,7
what in the world is that cred power payer doing,3
12 runs in last four overs.,3
Varun Chakravarthy has Krunal's cunty energy,4
El Clasico on cards RR reaching 12 rpo,2
"Target Varun, this is the over",1
"It’s 2020, so we could see Dhenier hit a boundary off Narine finally",2
I can guarantee the next overs will be equal to what Red says in Pokémon Gold and Silver,5
CSK finally found their test match mode after 10 overs,7
So last overs good for Kkr so the pitch is getting slower,2
The fuck is the cred guy doing,3
"CSK choke, seriously wth?",6
We have batsmen till 9. But the way the batsman bat makes feels like they think we only have 6,8
"For csk to win it, dhoni should get out",1
Kkr gonna win this match lol,2
Aight we had a good run,2
Fleming had scoffed when asked why Jadhav ahead of Dhoni hmm,7
Banger is not counting Dhoni's balls.,5
. 🎾 dhoni,6
ms can't hit a single off Narine for his life,8
"Dhoni is a good test player, ironic he retired from tests first",6

That saved 2!!!!,4
If krunal is here he will bowl 6 Yorkers,4
Anti-IPL fielding by Tripathi,5
the top 3 are crucial for csk. Get them out and maybe put pressure on sam and the game is going to be hard for csk.,1
Awesome fielding..!!,1
"Incredible stop. Keeps up the pressure.

Great stuff.",1
What's going on lads?,1
Guys time to think about Quantum Of Loss^TM ?,0
"DK to stump Dhoni

Perfect Ending",4
"rahul tripathi, pune lad doing bits... mildly pleased to see that",1
"Dhoni pls, stick to your regular form tonight.",4
Damn! Required Run rate shot up to 11.45 from 8.5 :(,4
CSK is still gonna narrowly win this,1
"Come on folks, even 15rpo is doable in last 5 overs. This is right up Dhoni's alley. He knows it! He loves it! He's MS Dhoni.",-1
CSK remembered their roots after 1.5 innings with the bat,0
I wonder if Ali Khan or Chris Green could at least get a match this season?,1
"Watch as thala mounts all the scoring pressure on Curran and then get credited for ""Guiding Curran""",1
How did they manage to fail at this! WTF!,0
Inb4 Curran 40(20) and dhoni wins it with a six.,2
That stop deserves Nicholas Pooran award,1
"Me: This is an easy chase. 

CSK: Oh I don't think so.",3
"KKR should make Dhoni run, he gets tired quickly now-a-days",5
absolutely brilliant,1
What's the longest streak of overs without boundaries in IPL?,3
We've all been playing 3D chess while DK has been playing 69D underwater checkers with sudoku.,8
"KXIP - why do bad shit happen to us? Things that were not possible like Tewatia, CSK’s opening firing that one single day.",3
KKR can win this only if they get Sam Curran out and get Kedar in and ensure no more wickets fall.,7
"Dhoni’a hitting it well, just to the fielders",3
Batdeep Singh Dhoni.,3
HOW is this match even tight lmao,2
Brilliant stop that.,2
Unrelated but how do you get a flair?,4
"Guys I'm a huge fan of MSD
But what I don't get is, you can even settle by striking the ball anywhere else safe singles down the ground rather than the fielders on the off side. I don't understand it Mr. Dhoni",9
"Man that tease.... T_T. Welp, there goes 4 overs worth of runs from Dhoni",3
Dhoni is lightning fast,8
"As a KKR fan, I'm happy that MSD will take it DEEEEEEP",7
20-2 in the last 5,1
"""Dhoni knows how to take it deep""

Yea maybe dont do that",8
Dhoni running 2s as rrr approaches 12 with a more explosive Curran at the other end...where have I seen this before,14
Imagine if KKR middle order capitalized on Tripathi's rapid 81 and scored 200+.,3
"Dhoni has strike rate of 200 in the last two balls

CSK will win",7
2k 2k Dhon1,3
"Who is the media gonna blame tonight since the CSK top order did well? 

Maybe It will be Curran and the lower order. 

“it’s not Dhoni’s fault the lower order can’t bat” 

I am gonna laugh so hard 😂😂😂😂😂",3
Dhoni keeps strike to Narine?,2
We're gonna lose by 7-8 runs again aren't we,6
Intent bois,1
Last game openers did the job for CSK. This game middle order better finish the job.,1
"Dhoni hits hard, finds fielders at the ring. This disappoints more than tuk tuk.",2
20-2 in the last 5 overs,5
Lmao just logged on after like 6-7 overs. How have CSK managed to fuck up a smooth chase,2
Oh man this match was exiting a few overs ago,1
Hey how do we get a team flair next to the username,2
How tf the RRR suddenly become almost 12? 😂😂😂,4
"""How deep do you wanna take the chase?""

Dhoni: *Yes*",6
How has this worked out for KKR?,1
"Dhoni and Curran should start hitting now.
We have batsman till 9.

Believing in yourself to hit 40 from 12 is a brain Dead move. Dhoni please don't do it.",2
So uhh .... Csk has a chance or no?,1
Come on thala!,2
Gill is shown stopping a boundary in the outfield. Sara looks at her dad again for that elusive approval.,5
"I have decided to not comment about Dhoni because folks can’t take it lol. 

The man speaks for himself! Master class innings coming up.",4
Russell is being held back for the real finisher K D JADHAV,7
Dhoni Fan Boys...what say ?,1
"The games so far this week had been very once sided. This looks like it will go to the wire, very refreshing.",5
I feel for Dhoni. Old Dhoni would have smacked couple of sixes from the last over.,9
CSK please don't lose this now.,6
58 runs in 5 overs without Cummins doesn’t look *too* difficult,8
20 runs in last 5 overs,5
Is CSK playing for NRR?,5
Dhoni already thinking about NRR™,7
"I know male commentators says it but when the woman commentator(Australian(?)) said ""He knows how to take it deep"" I lost it.",5
Is the dubai expo ad money laundering?,5
"KKR fielding could've been better, a lot of singles turned into 2's with bad diving",4
DK's masterstroke might just win them the game.,6
Stage is set for Dhoni to silence his critics,4
They are playing with 15 fielders!!,9
"Maybe RCB needs to keep the faith in Steyn. Watson, Narine have come good",5
This is getting out of hands for CSK,3
Just when I had tuned my mind ignore the commentary in lenskart advert they changed the match clip used and now my mundi goes up again.,4
Even the Dugout Gurus cannot understand these high IQ tactics that both teams are playing.,5
lowkey feel dhoni's gotta go back to the dressing room if csk wanna win this,1
"Dhoni is going to win it for CSK, just because of regression to the mean",2
tuk tuk dhoni making it interesting,5
We know Jaddu and Dhoni are gonna finish this so let's just get Jaddu on the pitch now,1
"Wait hol up, kkr got all out on the last ballvof their innings ?",6

Karthik brought Narine thinking Curran only smashes Indians but he forgot that Narine is a West Indian.,7
"Ah, the little wonder continues to be impressive.",6
Why is dhoni trying to attack narine? He couldn't do that in his prime. Play him out,5
Ah damn it i wish it was kd and dhoni instead curran is too good,1

We need more of this,7
Love this bloke,2
Damn Curran!!,2
Why hasnt in all these years someone told Narine that his hairstyle is ugly,0
Mavi & Nagarkoti will bowl last 2 overs and Dhoni is counting on it.,4
Curran ruining the CSK hate circlejerk,4
Dhoni reverse farming the strike and putting Curran on. Smart move.,2
Oh yeah. Need a lot more from Curran.,1
Oh this guy can bat too!!,1
Sam Curran making it happen,3
Scurran!,2
Take It Deep^TM,2
Narine hype died really quick!! Lol,3
Curran taller than Dhoni😳,2

Give this man the keys to our fucking franchise,1
Curran doing what Dhoni hasn't been able to do in years.,4
This is so satisfying,1
SAMMY 🤩,3
Sam Curran and breaking hearts. Name a more painful duo.,6
Watson looks so much in control when he is in flow,4
Imagine if Kkr had batted better and scored just 10-15 more runs.,2
Dhoni playing at a mighty strike rate of 70,-2
First boundary in 34 balls,1
Curran what a bad ass!!! FOUR,2
great fucking shot.,3
Curran is fantastic man,1
sam no respect for narine curran,1
Curran refusing to take it deep,9
"CSK, don't blue ball me by ""taking it deep"". Either get all out now or hit 5 sixes in the next over and finish it off",4
Curran to the rescue,4
More and more strike to Dhoni pls,1
Curran Boi doesnt give a fuck about Narine,5
"Quick thalla take some big deep breaths and leave six hitting to Curran.

  


Do your part.",3
Was Dhoni panting right there?,2
Watson and Rayudu slowed down a lot. They should’ve got out earlier if they were tired,-1
Curran is going to bail Dhoni out.,3
LMAO. A test specialist is smacking Narine around the park.,5
McCullum talking with fixers,7
Sam Curran is a FANTASTIC cricketer,6
CSK does have someone who can hit boundaries off Narine,4
Singakutty Curran 👌,3
Sam Curran to dk: Uno bitch,3
"Where does Sam Curran gets his power? 

With the Ball he doesn't look like he has Pace but Bounces out Batsmen, with the Bat he doesn't look like he has power but smashes quick runs.
Live wire in the field too.",9
it took Sam Curran 6 balls to smoke Naraine and to think MSD has not yet hit him for a boundary is insane,7
Curran to Dhoni: *Observe*,6
Ratty Q Ran is a good little player...,1
curran got me feeling some kind of way,2
Don't do this curran because u won't get the credit until Dhoni is on the crease,7
"Currantly, things are looking hopeful",4
Go Sammy go go go,4
Sam Curran protecting the tail!! Good batting.,18
Bringing in the correct batsman at the correct time need to learn from Dhoni.,2
MAKES THINGS HAPPEN!!,0
Sam curran has reached his 17 score limit.,12
"No one dare jinx Sam boy, else I will plant a bamboo in ur ass so deep it will grow outta ur mouth",2
MS knows his role is more about providing stability to the middle order now instead of finisher which is more of Curran/Jadeja’s job now,6
take out sam curran and the game gets real interesting,6
Those ten runs eased up the pressure damn,3
"I'm absolutely loving Scurran being used as a pinch hitter. It feels like it shouldn't work, but it does",7
Dhoni should give more & more strike to our more talented players Sam Curran.,9
Curran will keep the strike <3,3
Curran mah man,1
"Mccullum on his walkie talkie : “room service, what’s the menu for today’s dinner?”",5

"Faf

Sam. 
The rest are night watchmen",3
"FFS Dhoni, just hit a boundary off Narine, it shouldn't be that hard",2
 Curran to Dhoni: Ye mai kr leta hu ap jake Dream11 pr team bana lo,6
what is the issue with rayudu,3
KKR needs to keep their friend Dhoni on strike!!,3
Man.. Maybe it's all psychological. Cause Dhoni & Watto look like they can barely play Narine. Meanwhile Curran is out there making the same bowler look nothing special at all.,10
Curran didn’t get the taking it deep memo,5
Sam C > MSD.,5
"Convinced at this point Sammy has magic powers, just seems to have it on tap",3

Which letter does he not understand in  D E E P...",6
come on dhoni start hitting pls,3
Dhoni shouldn't even try batting now. Just captain the side. He's way past his prime,4
The Hast Fands of Sam Curran lol,6
"Russell 18 and 20, Narine 19. Interesting!",2
So russell bowls only 2?,3
Sammy: cunt it mode ACTIVATED,1
"Even though I criticize Dhoni a lot, I must say he always brings oit the best out of his batting partners.",0
[deleted],3
Lol. Dumbass captaincy,1
Karthik is the worst IPL captain by a long shot.,2
Narine vs Dhoni has been one of the most lopsided contests going around in IPL. Dhoni all at sea as always.,3
"

Curran: We should divide responsibility. I'll score the boundaries.

Dhoni: right and I'll take the credit.",17
Beautiful Dhoni,4
Dinesh Karthik first bad decision of the day was to cut his beard.,8
"Pie™

Edit: Humble Pie for me please",5
Imagine getting hit for a four by Thala,9
Russell isn't bowling because his knees are made of cheese,5
DK using Gambir tactics and trying to stop Dhoni's singles.,7

KD KD KD KD KD KD,1
What a selfish innings from Dhoni.,4
Jaddu please,1
oh ok tuk tuk cancelled.,5
👁️👄👁️ Wow that just happened huh?,2
Until this exact moment I thought Dhoni was like a foot taller than Sam Curran but he’s actually shorter.,4
Guys it's Jadhav who's coming on 😭😭😭😂😂😭😂😂😭😂,8
r/cricket just got a raging boner....,4
Wooooaahh comeback from Varun. Vital,4
Kkr to ask for review,7
LMAO,1
That was the best thing that could have happened to CSK.,5
"Ffs Dhoni, now the memes will never end",6
Mystery Varun for u,2
Tripathi has more Intent to win than other players of both the teams combined.,3
"Dang it, that actually improves CSK chances to win!",4
Dhoni's on to us! Get out early so we can't complain about him protecting his average,4
"Dhoni slogged the ball and missed it, kinda rare one",7
 I will take this any day over Dhoni trying 40 from 12.,7
7 crore Jadhav will win this for CSK now..,7
"Not thala, wtf dhoni 

This is such a anti dhoni move",5
Lmaoooo,1
No no no KKR what have you done!!,5
"Thella has given away his wicket for the team.

  


Thella always thinks about the team.",3
Lmao I don’t even remember the last time Dhoni got bowled like that,4
FUCK. Captains can call a dismissed batsman back right?,8
Bruh there's virtual cheerleaders now?,3
Fuck why Kedhar is walking in. Send Bravo or Jadeja to smash few,3
Stop calling him the greatest finisher. He was great but wasn't the greatest even in his prime.,2
Game slipped out of KKR’s hands right there,12
Dug out commentators are in shock!.,5
Used to bringing his team home? Lol,3
Lol the mutual funds ad of dhoni about retirement right after his wicket.,6
WOW lmao. This is really gonna come down to the last over,3
Classic ball !!!,2

Jadhav- My time has come (Works both ways),5
Damn..Dhoni is swole,3
Csk will win this now ffs.,1
Suck a dick csk...,1
"Fuck me, it's Kedar",5
Jadhav lol,2
"this felt so good, really have been a while",1
Not Kedar pls,2
Varun Chakraborty,1
He manages to kill every single chase. It's like a superpower.,1
Dhoni shutting up his critics by not hanging around till the last over,4
"DK - 12 (11)

Dhoni - 11 (12)

Noice",7
"Stand tall dhoni, thats how you have always hit.",2
Jadhav? Wtf!! 😂😂,2
Even though Dhoni got out this is how CSK should bat. What's the point of BatDEEP if you don't use it,5
"You miss !!!

I hit.",2
"DK 12(11)

Dhoni 11(12)

Perfectly balanced",14
Lmao,2
That's a pro gamer move by CSK,2
I don't care if Dhoni got out because he showed intent from the 1st ball and didn't play tuk tuk! That's a positive!,2
"Hey guys, you know what bowling full maybe just works!",2
KKR should review this imo,4
He was supposed to get the other guy out!,1
"Thala be like r/cricket can't meme me as tuk tuk Dhoni if I get out early

36D chess",3
Imagine losing from here,2
"Petition for ms dhoni to never play on his knees again...
Man you can smoke those balls right on your feet i have seen it",1
Yessss jadhav is in,1
Dhoni’s definitely planning to change his game against spinners. I don’t know if it’s possible at this stage but that does mean he understands his current set of skills won’t work. But atleast its appreciable he is not adamant.,1
KKR should be happy Jadhav is coming in next but Curran can do anything so he needs to go.,1
Thank got they sent KD. I was scared that Jaddu will come in.,7
"RRR when Dhoni came in: 9.5

RRR when Dhoni got out: 11.5

Dhoni SR = <100

Becoming all too common",9
OMG it's over Bois,2
"Oh boy, Jadhav in. It’s in the best interest of KKR to keep him until the end.",5

BMac using a radio to guide DK lmao.,2
I’m much happier dhoni tried and lost instead of sticking around and struggling.. he can come back stronger with this intent 😊,4
Time for Jadhav to redeem himself?,1
Jadhav is a sexy player.,1
Trolling us at this point,5
Lol no Sir?,1
Here comes Jadhavvvvv. About to take a giant shit on r/cricket,7
And everyone in India turns off their TV and goes to sleep,-1

"/r/cricket 16.1 KKR going to win this

/r/cricket 16.2 CSK have got this in the bag

/r/cricket 16.3 KKR 100% going to win",11
No way Jadhav should have come even if he takes CSK to win from here. Jadeja is a better contender.,2
Karma has a way of biting you in the ass when you put selfish motives above team's needs,-1
Why Jadhav now? Where is Bravo? Jadeja? Oh fuck it! Just fuck it! Lost a well set match,2
Perfect chance for Kedar to hit a four and play  another 10 matches for CSK,2
Thakur and Chahar hitting will be better than Jadhav's,2
"Can this subreddit please stop shitting on jadhav?
You all will shitpost him into form ffs.",9

“Finisher jadhav” said noone,3
"LMAO the Yippe advert where Dhoni says "" yeh hai clean bowled"" after him being out is is just LOL",9
Why is Kedar Jadhav being sent. Jadeja or Bravo should have been brought.,3
Is that eye of the tiger?!,2
Pain.,2
"C’mon KKR, I rather you win than CSK.😑",3
Need to bowl like the way Boom bowled yesterday!,1
"Oh Bravo yet to come, CSK should win this",5
Jadhav starting out with a proper test block.,7

Not too sad by that dismissal tbh,3
Nice defence fucker,3
Jadhav vs Narine will be fascinating to watch lol,2
"Equalizer Jadhav is back , nothing to worry",4
Im almost glad he got bowled. Wish people would stop kissing his ass,2
Amazing test match defence by Jadhav,3

Classic first ball,2
"Ms Dhoni goes.

Discount Ms comes.",2
"Jadhav madarchod wtf man lmao
Tuk tuk boss",9
Jadhav please for once prove us wrong you tiny useless fucker,5
Yeah Jadhav. A defence is what we needed right now.,5
"People call it circle jerking.

But truth be told...Dhoni has been shot since past few yrs.",5
Nice front foot defense.,4
well defended,4
jadhav u stupid fuck,6
Jadhav to defend all balls from now?,8
"Would be kinda weird if CSK manage to lose this, would make us kinda the worst",8
"Kedar ""street smart"" Jadhav",7
Kedhar Jadhav. Why. Just why does CSK do this,2
"5'4 Salman Khan version is here,boiss.",10
"wtf, Jadhav is in the squad?",5
helicopter crashed before taking off again,5
Dhoni seems more upset getting out now than he has ever been when he is not out at the end but team doesn't win.,5
Chakravarthy! You beauty!,1
Jadhav with the perfect defence in death overs chasing,11
Nice. Please play yourself in and take your time KJ,11
Loving the forward defense!,7
Almost 💯% strike rate for Dehnier,6
What an excellent front foot defense,6
SOLID DEFENCE ON THE 100TH BALL OF A T20,10
This should be the last chance for jhadav to prove himself,2
Kedar with the Day 5 defence,4
Jadhav latest contender for the Australian Test Tour.,3
Jadhav redemption arc?,3
[deleted],3
Either Jadhav wins or DK. r/cricket shitting on both,3
So can someone explain what Kedar Jadhav's role is in this CSK squad? Why Dhoni continues to keep him in the team?,2
This chakroborty guy won't sleep for few days,1
"First ball: front foot defence


I'm fucking done",10

The best defence ive seen in a while,3
Thala’s student on strike,3
This is very high IQ from Jadhav,9
Good defend by Jadhav,5
Why wasn’t Jadhav in the test squad against NZ ?,4
Kedar isn't even trying to hit it.,5
Hope Kedar gets out for a duck forcing us to drop him next game,2
We have jaddu shardul bravo. Why send jadhav?,6
Balaji looks like a blore techie.,3
Why tf he's defending,5
Bruh fuck this LMAO just give strike to my man Sam,6
JADHAV OMGGG WTF GET OUT OR HIT,11
Jadhav is the unbeaten lord of tuk tuk realms,26
The real Thala is in,11
They don’t have anyone to replace Jadhav?,6
Wtf Jadhav.,8
This jadhav motherfucker got paid by srk,6
The win is on Curran's bat.,3
Jadhav and Dhoni induced r/cricket rage is beautiful,13

Chakra just got better of MS after getting hit for 4. Gotta appreciate him 👏,6
Lol that's the only shot Jadhav knows,5
oh no not csk choking again.,3
Jadhav getting out also wouldn't be very bad.,4
DK's won it for KKR,3

"We have batting till #11, slogging is the way to go you fucks",3
"Kedar ""Street Smart"" Jadhav",3
3 dot balls. What is CSK Management smoking.,4
He wasted 3 balls lmao,1
Bekar Jadhav,2
CSK bowled beautifully! Pls don't fuck up you batters,2
3 fuckin Dot balls. Let that sink in.,1
Playing out 3 dots when you need 39 from just over 3 overs,5
Le le... retirement .,1
The good old days when Dhoni used to hit inside out over extra cover,1
HIT THE BALL U FUCK,1
And CSK has lost. Pack it up fellas.,2
Jaddu or Bravo would have been better.,2
Jadhav you useless piece of shit,1
"Jadhav, are you freaking kidding me!!",1
KJ following his guru well...taking it to the marina trench,3
Dhoni has learnt how to take it to the last over without staying in crease- just make way for Jadhav.,3
39 in 21 balls and Jadhav plays a forward defense. Amazing game awareness.,4
KKR if you wanna get Jadhav out that'd be greatly appreciated thanks.,1
This peedai Jadhav will cost us the match.,4
"Jadhav with all these dots :Don't worry captain, I will do what you couldn't",2
3 dots in 17th over .. cool cool cool,3
"DK was using big brain moves all day long, we mere mortals just couldn't see it.",6
I believe in Jadhav.,2
Pujara will be proud of Jadhav :),3
Hmmmm street smart^TM Jadhav probably belongs to the streets^TM,5
This match has already had such nice twist and turns,2
So what does Jadhav do exactly here?,4
Jadeja and Bravo in the dugout. Wonderful,2
Jadhav playing his natural game dw lads,1
Tamil boi wins it against chennai.,7
Curran should take a single first thing next over.,2
"Worst over ever.

  


Bowled a pie which Thella hit a four. And got Thella's wicket before 20th over.

  


Hope Jadhav rescues KKR",7
Jadhav doesnt disappoint,6
"Jadhav playing Dhoni role today making sure we don’t miss him.

You love to see it!",3
Csk batting problems have moved from the top order to the middle order now,3
Should have sent Jadeja,1
Big over alert 🚨🚨 Sammy to score 22 runs in this over. Mark it. Pin it. Whatever.,2
Replace Dhoni with Dhoni,3
Take a bow everyone to the one and only Don Jadhavman,3
4d chess by KKR by getting Dhoni out so that Kedar comes in and dotballs KKR to victory,8
Should have sent in Jadeja or Bravo or even Thakur. Anyone but Jadhav. Sigh!,3
Holy fuck this is annoying to watch lol.,2
"Good defence by Jadhav, atleast a strike rate of 20 by tea and csk will be able to tie the match...oh wait wrong format",7
"Fucking gun over from Varun. Elite mental strength. For everyone asking about Kuldeep's dropping, THIS is why Varun has been picked ahead of him.",7
Jadhav is trying to make sure no one blames thala today.,6
"Watson proving his critics wrong- You said I am done but I have still got it.

Dhoni proving his critics wrong- You said I should be coming up the order but that will not help because I suck there too lmao",4
Jadhav you fuck. Resign,1
I’m convinced that Curran and Jadeja are the only one who understand you have to score runs to win games lmao,5
Jadhav redemption thread,2
Holding back Narine has just won the game for KKR. Exceptional captaincy.,10
"Ffs KKR let CSK win this pls

RCB cannot handle CSK's Intent in the next match",3
Why did they send Jadhav man. Curran would be like 'WTF',3
If only Kuldeep was in form. Our spin attack could have been legendary.,2
I can't believe I'm seeing preemptive defense in the 17th over,3
Jadhav not even trying so that Curran can hit more runs.,2
Will he slog sweep? Will he come down the ground? Will he reverse sweep? Ah! FRONT FOOT DEFENSE,4
Jadhav needs to play 20 balls to pull a tewatia,5
"Jadhav 0(3)

I cannot express how happy this makes me

Side note: If this guy ever comes close to play for India again, I will punch a wall",4
Will Russel bowl,1
Fuck you jadhav,1
I want to see Natarajan in Indian T20 squad,2
KKR's best strat here is to give KD as much strike as possible,1
Ohhh fuck we lost.,1
"Jadhav looking to play out till the 20th over, can always accelerate later",1
I think kedar is going to shit on us at r/cricket so has been this year's ipl,3
KKR is cheating. They're playing with 12 players incl. Kedhar.,2
curran pls win this for us ur our only hope,2
This is funny because kkr fans are shitting on dk for using narine too late and csk fans are shitting on csk for sending in jadhav,6
Kedar is game changer,2
Just throw the bat at everything and we will win,1
Jadhav auditioning for Sammy Curran's test spot with all those blocks.,2
"Dhoni: I'm getting out, I'm too slow for this. 

Jadhav: Hold my Fanta.",5
Can we get a birthday special from Bravo,1
If Jadhav screws this up today he sure is getting dropped next match with the way Fleming behaves nowadays,0
"Right kedar, you don't wanna give your wicket away, so please make sure and take your time to get settled before making any rash shots",3
Jadhav won’t even score run a ball from here.,1
Amazing batting,1
Ik it’s not fixed but literally defending the ball with rrr above 12 will come with allegations of fixing,3
Just joined and why tf CSK is here in this position,2
Jadhav suk ur mum,0
Curran gonna win it for them ngl.,1
Curran should turn down singles,1
"lmao, now they are gonna take the run rate from 9.5 to 15 in next 2 overs",2
Stg if I ever catch Jadhav on the streets,5
I dont even care for CSK but Jadhav is already pissing me off,5
"So jadeja, bravo and chahar are yet to bat and they send jadhav with RR over 12. Genius",5
If curran and bravo were in this match would be over,3
Today is jadhav's day,0
This is some serious bullshit. The required rate is above 12 and this cunt comes and plays three dot balls intentionality.,5
How did the decision to hold out Narine for so long work this well? What happened there?,2
Imagine losing chasing a 168 total with 6 wickets to spare.,4
Let's hope jadhav does a tewatiya.,2
"Where was this CSK, vs KXIP?",3
Jadhav is street smart indeed. Conned CSK into a 7.8 cr contract.,6
Jadhav earns 8 crore. This shit earns 8 fucking Crores!,4
"Kedar Jadhav literally lives 2kms away from me 
I have seen him thousands of times
Im so proud that I never went up to him and asked for autograph",8
Morgan’s part-time captaincy job,2
"Sam Curran single off the first then Jadhav forward defence to the next 5 balls

Calling it now.",1
This over from Russell will define the game imo.,3
Atleast he didn't run 🤡,4
Fucking Shardul Thakur would be better for this situation.,1
"Jadhav hitting that whirlwind 120 off 76 balls against England in an ODI has really hurt India and CSK over the past 3 years. That was an exception, he is not fit enough, he is not good enough, cut your losses CSK, India already did",8
Russel..... *INTRESTING*,2
Bravo and Jadeja instead of this bhenchod!??,8
Kedar is an absolute piece of shit,2
What on earth is Jadhav doing,3
"Jadhav, Dhoni, Jadeja

The holy trinity for the opposition.",4
This has been great captaincy so far to be honest. Using your strike bowler early and then giving the spinners the chance with the oldest the ball can be!,7
And that's it gg,2
Fuck no wtf,2
Lol that’s the game. Sorry CSK,5
Russell u beauty,3
"Csk bat till 11, why are they not utlizing it?",5
Guys goodnight.,3
Fuck yeah Curran our. Now they’re gone for sure?,3
Game set match,3
Adiós,8
"Game over csk, u couldn't win this also smh",3
"Fuck off jadhav, fuck right off!!",4
Think csk misunderstand when people say they bat deep..wtf is this,1
Fuck off overrated,3
F in chat for the yellow bois,5
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck,1
And just like that DK has become an exceptional captain..,19
Dude im laughing so hard like wtfffff,2
Mr KKR strikes again!,1
DK making r/cricket eat crow?,5
There's the match Bois.... Will you all next match.....,2
game done these lickle chennai bois can’t face the short stuff from Dre Russ,1
Done and Dusted.,2
That's the match,2
Match Over,3
"Curran's our only hope here. If he takes us home, I'm definitely going to forgive him for what he did to the Indian team on their last tour to England.",3
Might be gone now for CSK.,2
F,1
Game fucking over boys,4
Not Russell this is jadhav's wicket,5
gg,1
This is a collapse of epic proportions.,3
How have CSK messed this up,7
WOOHOOOO... Love you DreRus,1
lol sam got morgs out last innings and now morgs caught the ball!,5
Noooooo whyyy.,1
GOODNIGHT. Cya guys tomorrow,8
When has Jadhav ever finished a game with the bat? He is handy in the 130/140 chases on spinning pitches but he’s not what you need here. Why is he promoted over proven hitters Jadeja and Bravo?,3
Lmaooo,3
"Russell isn't an easy bowler to put away, despite his military medium pace

Edit: as I said it lol",5
CSK imploding and imploding how ... DK's super high IQ captaincy is working tonight.,7
CSK choking is a pleasure to watch,3
I will cry,2
Dre Russ comes in and picks SCurran like he is a nobody,4
Russel is only using 2% of his powers in this ipl tbh.,3
F,4
[deleted],9
Noooooo this was meant to be my big over 😭,8
Jadhav ahead of Bravo and Jadeja?!?!,7
Dhoni looks sad,11
"I felt like Dhoni game at 4 today so he can somehow justify his purpose in the team. Meaning he isn’t just there cuz he is ‘thala’ and a captain. He actually adds some value and gets his team the victory. 

But hey, Varun Chakravarthy got David Warner so I ain’t going to pounce on him for getting out to him. Glad to see Varun Chakravarthy preform.",9
Pack it up fellas.,5
I usually criticise DK a lot but this is great captaincy by him. Perfect bowler for every batsman.,8
"Suck it r/cricket!


Brilliant captaincy from DK today..",9
Why the fuck wouldn’t you bowl Russell earlier ?,2
Imagine losing after being 90-1 in 10,8
Reddit again successfully shitposted bsDK into making 4d chess plays,8
How the hell did CSK manage to lose the plot with this game. Smh.,4
A Dhoni team choking in the group stages. Something I never thought I would say,7
Great job by Russell.💪,4
It feels like Sam Curran plays the same innings every game.,9
Jadhav crossed,2
Ded,1
CSK lost it.,1
DK captaincy was on point today,2
Morgan gets his revenge on Scurran,1
Russell doing with the ball,1
And that’s what happens when you assure the set batsman that he’s gonna have to do it all by himself because you’re worse than useless,3
YES. WE HAVE A DEATH OVERS SPECIALIST. WE DISMISSED THEIR BEST BATTER TOO!,3
Those 3 dots from Jadhav absolutely built pressure for that wicket.,8
Dre Russ..my man,6
Jadeja will still win it easily despite Kedar,2
Morgan is real captain here dk is just setting the field ...just like pant sets the field in DC,5
"Hold ya horses ,Jaddu can hit it",4
Time for someone to curry Curran's wicket,1
Does csk tail start at 4?,2
"The game is done and dusted for csk i think 

Or is it?",2
"Morgan making the field changes and talking with the bowlers, just make him captain already",9
We are done. Thanks Thala and Jadhav.,3
**COLLAPSE SUPER KINGS**,3
K O H L A P S E,2
Was Kedar Jadhav ever good enough?,1
Assist: Jadhav,4
Jadhav Tewatia moment incoming,3
Jadhav plays 3 dots now Curran gets desperate and gets out. What a shit show,3
"Kedar Jadhav is a such top class player

He is already honing his skills for the Test series against Australia in December

Fuck IPL matches, all glory for the National team

I mean, why do you guys not respect the hussle of this legend !?",4
Only KXIP can lose to CSK,4
Some of my friends support KKR. Just cause they have hots for Bengali chicks.,-1
Jadhav fuckin did this,6
Russell the batsman has underperformed but Russell the bowler has been really good.,7
Russell’s transferred his batting power to death bowling power.,4
jadhav should be dropped for those 3 balls alone what a dumbfuck,1
omg are... csk..... choking??,5
I have a strong feeling csk won't make it to playoffs,4
Send Bravo,2
SEND BRAVO NOT JADEJA OMG,4
Fucking obviously this was bound to happen. This lilliput literally left the last three balls of last over.,3
"The way Russell ran in, I felt he was warming up. I didn't think he would legitimately bowl, much less get a wicket.",3
Yeah that's gg... completely bottled by the middle order. We have no business losing 78 off 60 come on,5
It definitely gets harder when the ball gets older,1
Csk needs to clean house and get some youtthhh,1
"Meh, just appear like losing and then win it. Is this the real taking deep part? Or is it Jadhav’a redemption to show middle finger to us?",1
Guess this match was another one of those stoppable force against movable object kinda scenario,3
Birthday boy bravo winning it hopefully,1
"Curran is a 20(10) sort of player. If you’re relying on him to close a game by *himself* , you’re doing something wrong",3
DK playing 9D chess with the bowlers,3
Jadeja can still swing but Jadhav...,2
Why the hell isn't Bravo out there ?,1
Saala everybody bats in this team.,2
and with that all English TVs have their channels changed,5
"**17.1** Russell to Curran, OUT, can he ever? Can he ever? **129-5**

SM Curran c Morgan b Russell 17 (11b 1x4 1x6) SR: 154.54",3
Jadhav will now hit six sixes in an over.,3
Dinesh Kartik playing chess in  uncountably infinite dimensions,8
Currantly things are NOT looking good,6
oh no. Sir jadeja is here.,4
"DK to MS : match mai jeet leta hoon, aap Dream11 me team bana lo.",10
Collapse of epic proportions,3
"Faf, Watson, Curran and maybe Rayudu are the reliable batsmen on this team.",5
"Cummins bowled that economical over in the middle and since then CSK hasn't been in the game. 

Maybe came in for a second when Curran hit Narine for 6/4",8
Thakur would be better than Jadhav,3
"I not even disapointed, I am just sad!!",6
Russell is hard to hit. Has a mean bouncer and good Yorker!,3
Alright. We lost this.😭,4
"This isn't really RCB level bottling yet, but I'll take this for now.",7
Meh game tbh. Typical CSK. Openers get out. Dhoni comes in. Dhoni gets out. Game over.,5
Balajii,5
They were 94-1 after 10 lol,11
b a t d e e p,7
Holy fuck Jadeja Jadhav DJ Karn it's long tail,6
Guys relax lord Thakur is yet to come,11
Keep jadhav on strike please,7
DK best captain in IPL don't @ me,6
I guess DK outplayed us.,3
Just put under so much pressure by Dhoni and Jadhav. Can't blame him,1
I want Jadhav to be slaughtered by people online if he doesn't perform today,1
Jadhav won't even run lmao.,3
Did jaddu said chutiya to jadhav after he said no for the second run,1
Jadeja can hit it around. Worried about him.,2
The only way CSK is winning this is if Jadhav sacrifices his hamstring.,2
Csk can still make it. Don't count them out.,1
Lmfao Jaddu has a SR of 123 being a lower order batsman.,2
why is this fuck not running,5
Loda jadhav bhaag b nahi rha,3
Jadhav not even running ffs,2
CSK going the RCB way and RCB going the CSK way. Strange year indeed.,3
People shitting on DK for not using Narine in the first 10 overs. Where you at?,4
"Send birthday boy Bravo to finish the job already. Bravo didn't bowl to Russel , let him at least get to bat against him.",2
CSK middle order with smol pp energy,3
Despite the outcome I hope people learn to not shit on captains (DK in this context) after a couple of bad matches or calls.,2
"We never saw it coming, did we?",4
Haha jadhav,3
"Hahahaha, jadeja mad at jadhav",3
*CHOKING SUPER KANGZ*,2
"Russell bowls 140+ with a bad knee..
Hats off to the guy.",1
"This is nice captaincy by Morgan

Single handedly turned around the match after that shitty first half

You can see him talking to the bowlers every ball since 10th over",3
So a fielder and specialist hair dresser on the crease now,1
Jadhav fucker is good for nothing,1
DK apology thread when?,2
"Dhoni 10 years back : ""We want young and fresh players in the team""

Dhoni today: 'We want players with a lot of experience""",10
I am feeling happy for Karthik,3
Sam got Eoin out and now Eoin was half responsible for Sam getting out. They are Even Stevens now😀.,1
Someone has to try to hit if other players gonna play 3 dots in a 12 run an over required rate.,1
No way KJ is running a quick 2 with a hamstring that has the structural integrity of a snowflake,8
Used to be a fan of Slowni but then I grew up,1
"Should’ve sent Bravo, he has that BirthdayBoyEnergy^TM today",1
How is he hurrying batsmen with 135 ks on a slow pitch?,1
We bat till 11 but can't chase 168. on their way to 153/5 again. How does this happen again and again,2
DK comes across as a genius for holding Dre and Narine for the death overs.,3
I think Jaddu is the only one to have 100+ wickets and 2000 runs in the ipl,1
if jadhav doesn’t hit a 6 i’m gonna be fuming,1
How the fuck did Kings XI lose by 10 wickets to *this* chaska lineup?,8
All of a sudden DK is like 2011 MS,6
C'mon we'll win this,1
"does bravo play as an out and out bowler now?  
sure he's better than jadhav",3
Dhoni should have been the one to be given a room without a balcony.,6
"These match threads make the game so much more enjoyable, I love it!",7
Brilliant captaincy by Eoin Morgan.,7
What does Dhoni see in Jadhav ffs,11
Incoming proper defence,1
DK took it DEEP™ today,3
Time for some test cricket,2
Four over mid off incoming,2
RR 14.5 tf ?,2
Jadhav worst batsman of IPL?,3
Bhaag DK bose,1
3 fucking dot balls bro my head's hot,1
Great swinging by jadhav.,1
Jadhav please,1
Jadhav tf you counted fielders for a dot?😭,12
Plizz Jadhav.,3
Amazing 0 in 4 balls by jadhav,6
JADHAV YOU CHOOTH,5
CSK = Choking super kings!!!,7
Jadhav def match fixing,2
The self confidence shown by jadhav denying jadeja strike should be declared the 8th wonder of the world,13
*StReEt SmArT pLaYeR*,8
Jadhav 4 dots,9
Rinku Singh can't be worse than Jadhav?,5
Shankaresk miss,1
Don’t shit on r/cricket for lambasting DK’s captaincy everyone thought that was loony biz. look at the process not the outcome only,9
Bowls-a-heavy-ball™,3
Bravo still in the dugout. Is he out of form or injured? Why send Jadhav ahead when he hasn't been doing well.,1
DK OUT HERE WITH HIS 7D MOVES.. THAT BEARD WAS FUCKING HOLDING HIM BACK. DK DOES A TEWATIA BUT IN THE FORM OF CAPTAIN AAAAAAAA,9
"Well Sam, you took 2 wickets, scored runs quickly and gave me Fantasy points. Obi, your work was done here.",4
The last match just put some paper over the cracks. A lot of our batting order is shit.,2
WTF JADHAV MADACHOD,9
That fake audience is seriously ridiculous. Really need to sort it out,3
"I’m happy for Varun Chakravarthy. In his first season expectations were incredibly high and there must have been a lot of pressure on him.

Good to see him do well. On the other hand, it must be difficult for KKR to unable to use Kuldeep. Did lockdown kill his career? Not that he was exceptional in last year’s IPL.",3
Mistake by Dhoni to come out at 4.,0
"KKR lost a matchwinner in Dhoni but they have their other matchwinner, Jadhav in the crease.",9
11 of 12 from Dhoni. I understand taking it deep but man this isnt 2018 anymore.,3
0 in 5 balls,6
60% to 38% chance of winning,1
Jadhav why why why why u exist,2
"0 by 5 balls, guess the player.",2
Why tf he's even playing ffs.,1
Top notch batting by jadhav,1
"Man, this is so sad. The top 3 played so well",3
"Not a maiden over, surely?",1
Painful to watch Jadhav,4
"Jadhav already in retirement mode, totally given up on his career.",7
This dude is worse than Tewatia’s shitty phase.,9
Jadhav just feeling the pitch,5
"Can we give Morgan captaining theory a rest. Was he the captain when CSK was cruising? If that was DK, this is DK too.",8
Holy shit Jadhav is gonna get brutally trolled on twitter today,7
"This is actually embarrassing for an international player

At least Dhoni gets bat on ball",13
5 dots,3
KKR's walking injury bowling to CSK's walking injury. Gotta love it!,3
Inb4 jadhav pullsnoff a tewatia,5
A length ball from Russell is a short ball for Jadhav,5
"In the words of Danny Morrisson, ""the Double Js are at the crease""",5
"I hope none of these two get out now!

Don;t want Shardul Thakur in the crease suddenly in the last 10 days.",5
Jadhav dot ball count: 5,10
JADHAV LMAOO,5
Jadhav get the fuck out and give chance to bravo atleast,5
Jadhav you fucking cunt,3
At this rate Jadhav gonna raise the bat when he score his 1st run,12
Ohh fuck off Jadhav you piece of shit,8
Press F for Kedar’s CSK spot,8
Lol Jadhav looks like he might start crying,8
It's like Dhoni never got out...,9
Lord Jadhav is doing his bit for KKRs win...,5
Jadhav bhenchod,8
Jadhav best batsman,6
OMG. I think I might punch this guy.,3
And Jadhav has completely forgotten how to bat.,2
Jadhav 😂,3
"Ohh man, I am just waiting for Dhoni's post match after they lose this game.


Tip: Switch from Dugout to English. Dugout doesn't show post match interview immediately.",3
"DK, if he pulls this off, is a fucking genius with the bowling chances.",2
"I keep seeing people mention Bravo, he can't really bat anymore. He's not dangerous",2
Morgan it seems has overtaken the reins.,2
Jadhav looking at the umpire like as if bowling short balls is illegal,5
Gets off the mark in one over.,1
Nice Kedar Jadhav taking it deep,2
Most surprising twist of the day is the DK redemption arc. Hasn't put a foot wrong with his captaincy. Just 30 mins ago this whole thread was shitting on him for holding Narine back.,7
jadhav lol omg,2
"Yeah wr have lost it, both of them can't hit.",3
What an over so far from DreRus,3
"I want Jadhav to get a 10 ball duck and make us lose humiliating, so that MSD and Fleming will have no excuses to keep him for the rest of the IPL.",6
0(5) is really some half Tewatia BS come on,2
And takes a single...hahaha,1
Why wouldn’t they send in bravo after curran? It’s like they’re trying to lose.,3
Jadhav with a gritty 0 (5) bois.,6
Seriously hilarious what this match has turned out to be,2
Imagine earning 8 crores for this.,8
How t f is kedars exclusion from the team so obvious to everyone else other than CSK think tank.,3
Nice flick off the hips. A beautiful elegant shot!,2
You see that’s why Dhoni does not come out early. He gets exposed so bad and it hurts the brand.,7
Oya kr rha hai ye,1
"Should have bought some batsmen!! 

Motherfuckers!!",3
"Jadejadhav partnership is going to win this, still doable",1
Karthik to Morgan: ye me kar leta hoon aap jaake fielding karo,5
"Damn Russell is back again as KKR's Top wicket taker this season. 

He has switched from Batting AR to Bowl AR this season so far.",3
CSK burying themselves,5
"Ah yes. Kedar Cricket, inventor of the sport called Cricket",5
At this point Jadeja should refuse the strike to Jadhav,9
Jadhav doing exactly what is expected off him... Nothing,2
"Upgrad: I got promotion from learning not licking.

Jadhav : I got 7.8 cr for licking Dhoni

  


Jadhav> Upgrad",13
Man.. I'm not even a CSK fan. An usually I'm very understanding of the batsmen. But 1 (6) at this situation. C'mon Jadhav. Have to do better than that.,9
Don't worry folks Jadhav will play entire season without getting injured,6
he got a run!! let’s gooooo!!!,4
"If DJ doesnt get to Bat again and CSK loses, i'll be absolutely mad.",8
Scurran died for this shit,10
pathetic,12
Kkr need to be very clinical now. CSK can still win,6
"Jadhav 1\* (6)

KKR fans loving it.",13
Can Jadeja weave some magic?,5
Useless Jadhav,5
Reminder that Kedar Jadhav has an Indian contract. Go apply for that job! You’re not under qualified.,7
Gentle reminder that Jadhav was RCB's best batsman in 2017 lmao,13
Jadhav is such a frustrating player to watch.,8
Maula mere Maula mere Maula mere Maula,6
"Top 10 biggest mysteries science can’t solve

No.1– Jadhav’s role in this CSK lineup",16
Trivia: name the player with 1 run off 7 balls in the 18th over,9
"What kills me is, Kedar will play next csk game.",20
"Is Jadhav’s knock the worst in entire IPL history. 

Cannot think of a worse knock that was this bad comically.",19
Jadhav should raise his bat after the single,20
No way KKRs gonna lose this now,2
Now I want to see Jaddu refusing a single to Jadhav this over,6
"Russell and Pollard are sooo likely to come in clutch omg. Game changing players, and consistently so",4
So 2 remaining overs are Narine and Russell right?,2
I’ve seen this story too many times this season,4
That was some good bowling from russell,1
Well it's the energy that CSK is lacking.,1
"Is it just me or someone else also think behind Karthik's successful bowling rotation, it is perhaps Morgan who is devising these clever plans.",2
[deleted],9
Russell has quietly put in some great death overs this season. Respecc,6
36 off 12 still chaseable. Don't lose hope machas.,1
Russell is underrated as a bowler.,3
"Sam Curran is the real consistent player of the IPL, constant score of 15-18 in each match.",10
Kedar Jadhav wants to pull a tewatia but without the good part.,4
"God fucking hell Russel dada, just throw the ball at my face instead so I don't have to watch Jadhav bat",7
Can’t believe CSK will lose the match. At 10 over stage it was their game...,5
What happened to Kuldeep?,1
Reminds me of Pak v RSA wt20 2009 semifinal,1
"CSK going to lose by 20+ runs today

You heard it here first",5
He's just wasted a full over. Embarrassing,3
Shithousery from DJ playing Chammak Challo,3
"Yeah CSK ain't winning this. This loss is gonna be more infuriating than the last three, argh.",3
CSK Slowly but surely trying to snatch defeat from the mouth of a win,3
So kkr theme song is basically srk movie songs?,1
Jadhav counting fielders like he's gonna hit it in a gap and cleanly misses,5
"Hope Russel can Pull through this ,doesn't have much of a problem there",3
This guy is paid a million dollars for this,3
Gr8 over by Russell nevertheless,2
Fleming's having an existential crisis right now.,9
"Jadhav is a limited player, they'd get better results with Vijay playing at 5. Wouldn't you prefer a 4(6) instead of a 1(6)?",8
DK lowkey showing Dhoni he's still got it captaincy wise,3
Hazelwood rarely comes to play IPL and now he's here and on bench,6
One more Russell over and that's the game Butlya Jadhav can't do shit,2
MS to r/cricket: Mere retirement ki bhot fikr hai tum logo ko,5
What was Jadhav doing with those forward defence against Chakravarthy,2
Ian Bishop is the Sangakkara of bowling. Very insightful comments on bowling actions and tactics.,4
Jadhav got paid,7
Is it that stage where we move over from shitting on DK's captaincy to praising Morgan's captaincy?,5
"Jadhav got to play in India & CSK, because Dhoni always backed him. Change my mind.",6
"Eoin Morgan, ""look at me, I'm the captain now.""",6
Damn Jadhav cant bat for fucks sake,1
Jadhav single-handedly infuriating all of Chennai. Carry on good sir,5
It’s infuriating as a CSK fan to watch this shitshow especially Jadhav,2
CSK collapsing in the same way KKR did,1
BRO JADHAV WTF,1
CSK treating Russell like he's rabada. This is the most glorious botching up of a chase I've seen in a while,7
Jadhav bsdk,1
Send his ass straight from the field all the way back to India,1
Narine 😅🤣🤣,1
Come on jadeja.,1
"""ye andar ki baat hai, Jadhav hamare saath hai"" - KKR fans.",3
The pitch has really slowed down. Good idea to save Narine and Varun's over.,2
6 overs 64 not walk in the park,3
Omg. I am nervous,3
42 runs in 8 overs. They were 90 for 1 after 10 overs.,7
"My favourite part of the threads

Pant, Kohli, dhoni, jadhav while batting

Siraj, unadkat, rabada while bowling",10
Watching paint dry > this match,5
"CSK fans, If y'all lose from here, the below comment on cricbuzz by one of ya'll is the reason. I've never got more jinx vibes from anything else before

***SJ****: ""The sleeping giant has finally woken up! Should be a walk in  the park for CSK from this point on. As for KKR, lots of things are  going wrong for them, starting with their skipper first. They must make  some adjustments quickly to stay in contention for the next round.""*",9
Russell has been Excellent with the ball this season,5
DAE Street Smart?,3
Like I said CSK absorbed more than a little bit of RCB. #thenewRCB,4
I want to appreciate MS for working on his beard game. Nice barber find. Hope he is getting some good selfies,5
Some masterclass from DK saving Naraine and Russel for later part of the match.,3
"Full props to DK on his tactics but I still don’t agree. CSK still needed 68 of 48 when Narine came on. That is gonna lose you the game most of the time. It’s just that CSK are real shite with their batting. Everyone after Rayudu is just a big name not a good player anymore. The one who shall not be named .And even with that if Curran doesn’t get out, you lose the game.",8
Now or never for Jadhav,1
"I don't think Kedar sucks, but the way they use him definitely is. He needs a few balls to get in and Curran can hit right away. Why send in Curran in the 14th over and Kedar in the 17th? Also, he's not good enough on batting alone, but he's handy with the ball. Play another batsmen and let him bowl part time.",1
"Do I play for pride? No.

Do I play for glory? No.

For money? No. 

For family, for country, for the sheer essence of competition...? No.

You see sir, I play so that one day I might be named the Altroz Super Striker of the Match™",5
Imagine having batting till 11 and sending this clown Jadhav in,3
Keep trashing KKR here don't drop your guards here r/Cricket,7
Jadhav to play out the last over before tea,4
I thought KKR bottled this with 74 off last 10 and we have 42 off the last 8 lmao,3
Jadhav chance to redeem himself and do a tewatia.,3
I really want csk to finish last if they lose this match. Stop this experience player grabbing bullshit,6
"Kedar Jadhav is the best batsman in death overs.

For the opposition.",5
Welcome to the shit batting club CSK,2
Eoin Morgan is talking to the bowlers all the time. Looks like he the designated bowling captain of KKR.,8
"KXIP are generally shit, except that match, no CSK batsman except Curran has shown he can go at 150 strike rate from the word go",7
I know Jadhav's neighbor. You can send me whatever message needs to be passed on. I will insert the MCs and BCs myself.,7
If you thought Dhoni was bad....,8
"bugger off Jadhav, You don't deserve to be wearing the jersey of CSK.",6
Kedar is good against spin.,4
Damn Jadeja tryna break his back or something there ?,3
Another classic suicide by CSK.,3
Whoever thought of keeping Narine till the end took a gamble. Gamble paid off.,7
Tripathi's innings 🙏,4
"CSK plays for NRR, Jadhav plays for KKR",36
Oo jadhav,3
Jadhav suddenly has more fans and people supporting him than he has in his entire career,8
"I think CSK should drop Jadhav and give an extended run to youngsters. Even if he somehow miraculously ends up winning this game for CSK, he is a shadow of his past self with the bat, a liability on the field and is not bowling either.",6
I don't believe my eyes.,5
God's miracle,5
SRH may win tomorrow. Kings look hopeless.,0
"Shit Jadhav hit a four, I'm sorry csk fans, his spot is now cemented",13
Raina is the missing link. They are playing like they still have him down the order,8
I am not ready for tomorrow's game...No Bhuvi against arguably the best batting side,8
Why csk fans are acting as if this wouldn't have had happened ?,8
"When kkr does bad: DK iS a ShIT CapTAiN
When kkr does good: MoRgAn iS DoiNG iT.

Y’all are just dumb",14
kedar tewatia???,4
Curran must be seething with anger at these clueless idiots,6
"Prediction : Russel bowls last over. A sudden short rain forces ground to be slippery. Russel keeps slipping, all balls are wides. He bowls 36 wides. Csk takes home victory",13
Jadhav with I N T E N T,7
Jadhav redemption,6
Csk could've won this,3
wow jadhav!,4
Dhoni's expressions throughout the season has been like a failed dad,4
"Morgan's kinda involved but looks like this was the plan all along. Keep the spinners for when the wicket slows to a pulp and they responded by removing the dangers.

If Narine closes this out it a fantastic spell.",5
This short to Rohit and he will hit you on roof,10
4 sixes jadhav,2
Can he pull a twatiya?,4
Mistake by Karthik. Jadhav and Jadeja are strong against spin.,1
Lord Jadhav 🙏🙏🙏,3
Kadhav’a first four in how many years?,6
Yeah that’s Jadhav’s quota for the total boundaries this season,11
Lord Jadhev coming on,2
"Curran can’t always be expected to perform. If he fails, then who will step-up? Like how TF can Jadeja, Dhoni and Bravo can’t be trusted to close the game? You have to be kidding me if Bravo can’t bat.",7
"My lecture starts right at  lunch time (12 PM)

Still who has a more shitty timing - 

my lectures or Jadhav-Jadeja ?",5
Gotta hand it to them - that's one hell of a choke job by Chennai with the bat,5
18 runs an over..  :(,3
"No excuses here, we should have won this game",9
Didn't have to be so close.,1
[deleted],9
Jadhav doing the dhoni,3
Should have been Mavi,3
Time wasting tactic™,2
Hits a four and asks for a new bat lmao,17
Kedar Jadhav is stealing a living,3
We should have sent bravo.,2
Lol Jadhav replacing bat after 1 boundary,6
Bravo taking a nap.,2
Jadhav is just waiting for the perfect time to pull a Tewatia guys,7
Jadhav bringing out his Tewatia bat now.,6
Ofcourse a change in bat,3
"So Watto and Faf gone, match gone for CSK.",4
so jadhav can hit narine for a boundary but Dhoni can't,5
This is Jadhav just trolling us,8
A spinner in the death overs is always a risk. Maybe should've gone with Nagarkoti.,1
[deleted],6
Well well well jadhav changing bats,2
"Strategy of keeping Narine till the 10th over

If it works, r/cricket: Home work done by Bmac and team, good suggestion by onfield captain Morgan. 

It it fails, r/cricket: DK is the worst captain of the IPL, cant wait for the mid-tournament captaincy switch.",9
Kamlesh nagarkoti looks a little bit like Jin kazama from tekken.,2
Every match I've watched the chasing team has lost. Somehow that's about to happen again...,1
My 2 bucks on Jadhav getting out after the bat change,1
Both teams played like shit after their 10 overs.,1
CSK are a team of Dhoni mimickers,6
"People asking will he pull a Tewatia 

Answer : Big NO.",6
That Russel over tho. Removed Curran and perfect lengths to Jadhav at pace,2
CSK: Pta nahi kyu aise situation mein hamesha me hi  kyu aa jaata hu,1
"I hated it when rcb dropped so many good players over the years.
Do not regret jadhav",2
Jadhav dot ball count : 6,2
What things exactly go into the fair play award?,1
Super over would feel like a win rn,3
😞,2
Should Punjab do this? Use Mujib and other wrist spinners in death (except Sharjah)? Can't be worse than our pace bowlers,2
"Yes that's right, its the bat's fault that you bat like its a test match  Jadhav.",3
Kedar Jadhav out there pretending to be a cricketer.,4
"Obviously it was the Bat's fault guys, curse that stupid bat",5
That was a Wide!!,2
Great batting jadhav baby,5
"Lmfao what did he do with that bat, he missed 3 of his 7 deliveries at least. Why does he need a change now?",2
If KKR pull this off. Credits to DK.,6
"Just a reminder, this mug earns 7.8 crore per season for this shitshow.",9
Fielder almost gifted Jadhav the boundary so CSK wouldn't drop him lmao,8
"Ha! Yeah,  the bat is the problem. You useless fella",7
"This was a self inflicted choke by csk, they can't qualify for playoffs like this",14
Yo..what did we do to be 7th on fair play rankings?,2
"KKR on top of fair play award  ,this is a parallel time line people",3
BMac trying to pull off sandpaper gate 2 with that walkie talkie?,3
Lol danny just said 3 dots to go,6
"Should've sent Bravo in, he'd have tried to win it even if it meant he would get injured. These two ain't doing anything.",6
Amzing 8 balls 5 run by jadhav,13
That was a fucking wide,7
Jadhav doesn’t fit in this team at all,9
Yo why tf are we at the bottom of the fair play?,6
Jadhav about to pull a tewathia?,8
"Jadhav - 7.8crs
I bless you.
Take the money and don't ever look back at a cricketing ground.
Enjoy your retirement life.",23
"Unpopular opinion but these matches are toooo slow. They keep changing bats, gloves. 4 hrs for a game is too much",10
New bat did wonders.,8
All the commentators keep talking about the CSK batting depth but it doesn't reflect in their middle order performances so far. Hope they get in form as the tournament progresses.,3
Give me a Super over please,2
Is it possible for csk to win now??,1
"Even if jadhav tries to hit a six, the Earth's gravity will increase 3 fold and ensure that it ends up inside the 30 yard circle",2
Fat lady Swanny has already sung.,1
Jadhav played cricket for India in 2020.,7
Will this be the year that CSK won't qualify to the playoff?,5
~~can he pull a twatiya?~~ Can he pull a single?,6
What did we do to be #1 in the fair play award? Missed most of the DC game,3
"Love how the KKR try new things, some work some don’t but atleast they back their ideas, probably also plan around the match up stats. Narine and Varun bowling 6 in the last 10 is interesting",5
Curran must be thinking he is in the wrong team,6
Dude WTF. Just went to attend an online class. How did CSK manage to bottle this??,7
Fuck off jadhav!,3
Imagine beating KXIP and thinking you are back in the tournament!,8
Jadhav is COMPLETELY WASHED. Take your money and kindly fuck off,11
"Yep, can play defense better with the new bat!",11
"It was a very similar target CSK chased against Mumbai in the 2018 opener, but their chase has been the opposite of that match tonight. I haven't seen Jadhav play one decent innings since after his bowling got found out. Dude can't catch a break",2
THE DJ TAKING THE PISS WITH THE LIVE UNRECORDED CSK CHANTING,3
Hagg diya yaar,2
*Lawde ka* all-rounder.,5
70 of last 4 in an impossible chase two matches ago. And today they cant do 78 of last 10. Absolutely ridiculous. Karthik looking like a genius now with his decision to hold back Narine till the 11th over,6
StreetSmart^TM,2
Name a replacement for Raina and play him instead of Jadhav. How fucking hard is that! CSK management are retarded or what,3
"Kedar ""Manoj Prabhakar"" Jadhav",2
"\*hits a boundary\*  
too much intent, lets change the bat",2
Still can't believe this guy pulled off that limping victory against us 2 years ago,1
DJ is trolling CSK,1
"Whenever commentators say 'saw him coming' in reference to a bowler changing their delivery in response to a batsman charging down the pitch, I think of that Harry and Paul sketch where there's the shop that sells overpriced tat

I get that this is a very niche English reference, just checking if anyone else makes that connection like I do

Edit: [for reference ](https://youtu.be/1i4rgxOi73c)",3
"Lol, Bravo is sleeping, people discussing tomorrow's game.",5
CSK isn't even trying anymore...this is a disgrace,2
After first 9 overs I predicted no way CSK is gonna lose but well well well...,2
Jadhav should’ve just given jadeja strike,1
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ TAKE OUR ENERGY KKR ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ,2
For the irony check out kedar jadhav's twitter cover photo,2
"Tewatia to Jadhav: Beta, tumse na ho payega",5
6 please 🙏,1
Jadhav has shrini mamas nudes I guess.,5
"Wtf happened. I thought CSK will win, few overs back",4
Raaaiiinnnaaaaaa,1
Captain Cool Dinesh Karthik.,2
Jaddu can be game changer?,1
Plizz Jaddu.,1
Fuck why didn't they send out Thakur. Why did they send out Jadhav in this situation.,7
How much better are CSK bowlers expected to do? This is pathetic chasing.,11
Who is the guy sitting next to McCullum,2
Watching CSK lose is somehow so satisfying,19
"I can’t even blame Jadhav. He is struggling so shouldn’t have really come at this stage to bat.

But what the fuck the management thinking sending ahead of Bravo and Jadeja seriously",6
"Naarayan, naarayan.",6
This is kkr's game to lose now they should be atleast win by 14 runs,6
"I want CSK to win so that Jadhav plays the next game against RCB

Take all my strength Kedar-san(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ",14
Selectors take note we have a decent prospect for the Test side,7
Don't fucking go for 6 pls,3
Should have sent Bravo in place of Jadhav!,12
Bravo is smart by dozing off instead of watching the chase.,9
Tbh a lot of non CSK supporters feel schadenfreude because CSK really overachieved with their smart cricket over the past decade.,8
"6(9), just what CSK needed",12
How did kkr manage to pull this off?,11
thats some slow poison captaincy from dk+morgan.,13
DK has a special fuck you for Dhoni for ruining his career as a player.,19
SRK really like his team.,5
Jadhav took a new bat coz he couldn't middle the last 5 defenses,15
THALA trained his disciples well I see.,15
"So why is Jadhav in the team, can't bat, can't bowl, can't field. Lord Binny would have done a better job than him.",26
Jadhav now asking for a change of underwear as well. He's not wearing his lucky ones.,8
Holy shit i was right. 26 runs of the final over.,7
Jadhav has some real dirt on Fleming or MS on him lmao,8
"Lol Jadhav on Strike, game over",3
There's no way they'll hit 26 in russell's over if they haven't played 10 balls atleast,3
KKR will (rightly) never drop Narine,5
One of these teams need to take one for the...well...team and allow Jadhav to score a 50(30) in one match so he doesn't get dropped in future matches,2
"Literally any of the tailenders will have done better than Jadhav today. Dude literally defended his first 3 deliveries. I can excuse play and miss, but at this point to not show intent is a crime.",6
"Not sure why Bravo wasn't sent in, but I ain't complaining lol.",3
"26 in last oher with Jadhav on strike


I have more chances to get laid",22
I've been betrayed,3
I cant believe this is happening.,1
Ab thread mein maza aayega na bhidu,2
"Kedar jadhav hits boundary,
On such a high note he should announce his retirement",8
F U C K Y O U J A D H A V,2
"Narine, you fucking beauty.",6
KKR has stolen a win here,5
Inb4 Jadhav plays a beautiful defensive shot on the first ball of the last fucking over.,11
26 to get and Jadhav on strike to Russell. This is going to be funnnnn,7
fuck jadhav,3
Jadhav honestly stealing a living out here,6
Narine and Russell are complete chads Lmao,2
I can't believe how on Earth KKR managed to pull this game back,3
Jadhav on strike. Pack it up boys,3
"Do you know what's worse than a dot ball


Fucking Jadhav on strike again",7
Our first problem was murli vijay. And our second problem is jadhav.,2
Looks like we might never see the Jadeja sword swing this year.,1
CSK is the most intent less team. They don't look like they want to win at all,5
GUYS WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK DID WE SEE TODAY,6
Choking Super Kings 😂😂😂,2
Anyone in for a super-over?,3
Fleming and Dhoni deserve so much shit for sending in Kedar lmao what the fuck are they thinking?,5
Russell gonna finish it up for KKR,3
"This team has 4 potential finishers: Dhoni, Jadeja, Curran and Bravo. They are all capped players. 

It would be incredibly shameful if they can’t finish the game. It feels like Curran has to be the one to finish for them or else they will collapse.",6
Meanwhile narine loads a big middle to r/cricket including me..,2
What a shitshow,1
3 dots and a single incoming,1
Jadhav having nudes of MS and Flemming?,5
Eoin Morgan captaincy masterclass.,1
Yaay another game gone because of sir jadhav and lord dhoni,3
This is just such a sad fucking match now,1
Time for six 4s from young Jadhav,3
CSK only have a chance if the first ball is a wicket,1
"Dot Balls Count:

MSD - 5

Kedhar - 8*

Kedhar >>>>> MSD",3
"KJ has let pune down there , Tripathi did enough today tbf",2
"I thought we have the shittiest middle order... Lmao, CSK is giving us a stiff competition.",2
"Gg boys, we choked it.",3
Just how fucking useless is Jadhav. Fuck you man,2
It's actually sad that the only consistent batsman in that CSK side is Faf.,2
Unsure if masterstroke or masterchoke,3
"Even with Dhoni's form, 26 off of 6 looks achievable. With Jadhav, 10 won't be possible. Argh, they should've won this match, stupid fucking loss.",7
At least Tewatia made 14 off 21.,5
Narine back to his poker faced business,3
Who trimmed DK's beards? Barber or gardener?,3
I don't remember watching a worse innings in ipl than Jadhav's today,6
"Instead of spring, Jadhav put lead in his bat.",2
"Come on KKR, final over to hold your mettle",3
"Huge gamble sending Narine imo, does Karthik think the young pacers can't hold it together?",4
"Csk is playing very hard...


      To become new chokers in the tournament..",2
Credit where credit is due. DK has captained well here,7
What a fucking disappointment,3
No premature sword celebration this time Jadeja ? Lolololol,3
It official. We cannot chase any score.,8
Now we know why India lost the semi-finals against NZ.,4
Great dot bb,2
“Take it deep” is a flawed strategy which is better exposed early so that India can come out of it.,5
Whoever said Virgin Jadhav vs Chad Russell is actually factually and literally correct I think.,2
18 from overs 17-19. Pathetic is a very small word,3
"This match will be right there in the mother of comebacks. What a choke

Another I remember is Mumbai chasing it down  even after being 7/4 vs RCB",3
Hahaha csk losing the match. Love to see it,3
I just realised I've never heard Narine speak,5
Nothing short of a Yuvraj will let csk win atm,3
OMG THEY DIDNT RUN FOR THAT?,6
Lmao,2
"Whatever Swann is drinking, he has had too much. Dhoni should start drinking right about now",3
Refusing a single?,1
Should Morgan still replace DK as captain r/Cricket?,3
Dot ball? What the fuck,3
why is Bravo not out in the middle?,1
Nagarkoti and Mavi won't finish their quotas which is understandable but it makes me sad.,3
I dont see why jadeja is in the team either. He is shit with the ball and can't jit with the bat.,2
"I don't know if this is a choke. The batting past the top three isn't very good. Its been evident throughout this tournament. Dhoni, Jadhav, Jadeja have forgotten how to bat it seems.",1
Didn't Even took a single,1
Doesn't run,1
Jadhav misunderstood who the game changer of the match award is for.,4
They didnt run? Wtf,2
Y didn't they run ffs 😂,1
KKR's batting lineup today was pretty good. Just interchange morgans and naraine's batting orders and it should be fine,3
Jadhav coming ahead likes of Bravo and Shardul is peak CSK when RRR is 13+,6
"Time to bring in some youth. Drop Jadhav, play Jagadeeshan or Gaikwad",3
StReEt SmArT bAtSmAn,6
"Wtf Jadhav, didn't even run?",3
Utterly useless middle order,4
So it seems CSK are only worth beating KXIP this season(the win against MI doesn’t count because it’s their ritual to lose the first game),5
That Lenskart ad is some Black Mirror shit they pulled for this situation precisely,2
Thank god Jadhav is out of Indian team,3
Two obligatory bouncers imcoming.,1
CSK had made DK look like a genius..,2
Commentary was talking shit about Narine not bowling early but that tactic totally changed the match for KKR,3
Jadhav commiting seppuku,3
Goodbye Jadhav. Nobody's gonna miss you.,3
Jadhav is useless.,2
Only Dinesh Karthik can win from this over for csk #nidahas,3
CSK should have send Shardul Thakur instead Jadhav. At least they chance to win.,5
WTF is kedhar jadhav?,5
"If KKR win this, Narine man of the match for me",4
Bravo is going to kill Jadhav in the locker room today.,3
14 runs in 5 overs.......,5
At least Dhoni could bat for NRR.,2
I hope we never ever see Jadav in national team. He looks more done than Dhoni.,3
ohh the confidence to not run,3
Virgin Jadhav VS CHAD Russel - last over,3
Daily reminder that Jadhav earns more than double of what Rabada earns,3
Credit where it's due. DK had a plan and stuck with it. It's worked like a charm.,4
Kya chutiya hai be ye jadhav,3
"Only reason I can think of, why Jadhav defended 3 balls, 'cause he has some kind of reading disability.",3
Jadhav lol,1
Lmaooooo,1
Why would you not run you fucking idiot,4
"Only CSK can WIN a match like this.
Only CSK can LOSE a match like this.",6
Jadhav retained the strike? Lol why?,7
There better be a Kedar Jadhav sledge thread after this match,8
Yep..,1
Do they realise that 2 dots and the game is done? Why didn't they run,3
He didn't run wtf? Why why why???,6
"HAHAHAHAHAA 

Did he just refuse a single holy shit",5
"Didn’t even attempt to run what the fuck lmao

Probably thinks  he can he can hit 5 sixes lol",5
Jadhav is the greatest conman in the world,1
Lmao,1
"they have absolutely given up, clowns",3
How tf did CSK manage to lose this one?,8
Damn jadhav you absolute champion,3
Can I celebrate csk loss now?,2
"To be tbh I was kinda expecting a more close match, not gonna ngl",3
What a horrendous innings this is from Jadhav,3
"Jadhav saving NRR guys, chill. He learned from the master.",3
"Bravo sitting in the dugout idly to Jadhav - Ye mai karleta hu aap jaake Dream11 pe team banao""",3
LMAOOO,3
"Ooo Jadhav didn’t run, 4 sixes coming",2
Jadeja's 7(5) has flown under the radar because of that Jadhav innings lol,5
I love this match ngl,7
"Csk needs a change in captaincy.

It might be a bitter pill to swallow. But it will work.

And a change of coach as well !!",-1
Jadhav doesn’t even run.,2
I'm not kidding but CSK's absolute lack of urgency feels extremely fixed,7
Lol.,1
"Jadhav thank you for making this match so interesting

Honourable mention: dhoni",4
"Lol, Jadhav isn’t a finisher. But Thala wanted to be a hero and went ahead of him.",2
Wow what a comeback,4
Fleming looks like he's about to commit a genocide in the CSK locker room,9
:(,3
FUCK YOU JADHAV FUCK YOU FUCKNYOU FUCKGKG,7
"Scenes if Russel bowls a maiden lmao 

Wouldn't be improbable with Jadhav out there",7
Lol,2
What the actual fuck how bad are you jadhav,4
"Wow, just wow. Fuck you CSK, seriously. Fuck you Jadhav, fuck you to hell.",10
Absolute state. They had 5 fucking wickets left and weren’t swinging.,8
I stopped watching at 90-1 and came back now. Wtf happened 😂,9
7.8 crores and you get this.. Pay me half and I can do so much better :),5
I feel really sorry for jadhav.,6
Kedar Jadhav is just a money laundering scheme,5
This is actually hilarious,7
We should now add struggling batsmen to the Jadhav Academy. This is painful to watch.,3
Atleast Dhoni Hits in the last over.,5
Jadhav is probably playing his last match so he wants to face all the balls,7
Lol Jadhav this is sad,5
Kick this guy out. FFS,8
Guess Raina was the secret ingredient in Dhoni's CSK captaincy.,8
Jadhav's just trolling now,4
"I just want us to be eliminated man. Get 8th, whatever. Whatever it takes for some passengers in the team to be thrown out of the team.",3
"Jadhav seems kinda sus, CSK should kick him the fuck out. He's been an absolute trash.",8
"Useless piece of shit!!

Motherfucker shouldn't be anywhere near any team!",5
Hahahahahaha this is so good . Loving every moment of this,2
"Lmao, we didn't deserve to win this one.",4
"Wtf is it with the chants. Lmao heard it as Jhaantu, Jhaantu.",3
I fucking want to kill that Jadhav for not running.,6
Why not give youngsters some chance?,1
Don't bowl a NO or Wide now. PLEASE!,3
Daily reminder that Jadhav gets paid more than Bumrah,8
LooL what a pathetic player,2
Choker Super Kings...,1
I just can't wait to see dk and murli vijay together 😂,5
Legal deliveries please!,2
CSK have managed to chole this successfully. Jadhav is so bad it seems he is playing for KKR,3
Those 12 runs that CSK would have if Jadhav stayed on pace would be useful right now.,2
"And just like that, it's over",4
Lol Jadhav this is sad,5
Jadhav has to be getting paid to be so bad at this point I can't believe anything else,7
"Thakur once hit 6 sixes in 6 balls in the competitive Mumbai school cricket, was worth a punt against the spinner. Now he is sitting and watching Jadhav score at a strike rate of 50",4
Why didnt you fucking run!,2
"Fleming : why can't he score boundaries?  
Josh : Hazelwood.",2
"I'm laughing hard here looking at Kedar batting. I don't know man, I don't feel bad anymore.",9
They are not even playing for NRR this time LOL,4
Jadhav worst player in IPL?,4
"At least CSK should’ve tried sending Thakur out early. He whacks the bat so hard, maybe he gets out, maybe he hits couple of sixes. Anyway a better choice over Mr Snooze Jadhav",3
Not even gonna hit those nrr runs?,3
Fk bc,3
"why is bravo not being promoted to bat, bravo is a finisher too right",3
What more proof do they want that Jadhav is inept at an international level?,9
WTF lol,3
When you have Bravo and Thakur in your team who can swing but you send in Jadhav.,5
Kedar HAS to have Dhoni and Flemming's nudes. No way is he in the fucking team,5
"Jadhav is fucking useless, why csk select him still now is baffling",4
"_26 needed from 6_

INTENT is strong with this one.",6
Probably the last we see of Jadhav in IPL 2020.,7
Pain.,1
KKR wanted Jadhav to run for a two lol,2
"Jadhav, please work at least for the money you get paid.",3
Bravo with dick in hand ayyy,2
He thought he had middled it:(,2
Lmao Jadhav,5
Is Jadhav injured?,1
Classic Jadhav 10 Cr. Repaid,5
Do you think the reason 'we lost the momentum' is any good in modern IPL games ?,1
If Jadhav doesn't get dropped now he has Dhoni's child hostage,8
Jadhav ensuring he doesn't play in the IPL again with this innings,6
Bro this dude can't even bat,1
Seeing csk lose feels sooo good,-1
Jadhav be like I’ll only give away the strike when I’m sure we have lost,5
"Why didn't they send Bravo 
What te actual fuck",3
It's working guys. Dhoni made sure jadhav plays more dot balls so no one would blame him. Master stroke by thala. Tips working like always.,2
Not sending Bravo is the mistake fuck,3
Jadhav successfully won the game for KKR,7
Jadhav replacement?,3
Can CSK drop Jadhav and never pick him again? Kedhar is anti-Tewatia.,5
DK is a genius!!,5
CSK and Dhoni deserved to loose because of their shitty squad selection.,6
I love kedar's batting- said no one ever,7
"Props to Russel.However horrendous Jadhav is batting, Russel is bowling really well.",4
This is the tamest end I have seen to a t20 match in a long time.,6
Jadhav is now disappointing artificial crowd,5
Ada Pongada. GG.,5
"> Game is running away from CSK


Genius commentator when 26 runs required from 4 balls.",14
Long Live Kedaritharan ... it was fun while it lasted. Now fade away in obscurity please.,3
This is painful to watch. Jadhav has basically been doing Tewatia (bad part of his innings) without leading up to anything good for years.,11
Unbelievable comeback from KKR. Will do wonders to their confidence. Especially this young bowling lineup. Well done boys,6
Jadhav for MOTM from a KKR perspective,6
You all put some respek on ma boi DK's name now,3
Lol Jadhav changed his boundary bat to his dot bat,14
Lenskart countering Cred's cringe.,1
"Jadhav is an equivalent to Jeevan Mendis. A shit batsman, a shit bowler and an okay fielder.",6
How the fuck does this mf earn 7.8crs when someone like chahal earns only 6cr,4
I cant sleep,3
RIP Kedar's Insta/Twitter,11
LOSER JADHAV!! LOVE TO SEE CSK LOSE HAHAHA,1
I know the pitch has slowed up in the last 10 but this has been one of the worst displays of batting I've seen at this level,9
Alright bois time to sleep,1
Even if my russel didnt do well with bat but he surely is banging with the ball,2
Jadhav seeing off the new ball,8
Jadhav legit must have MSD’s nudes,17
"8 crores for a strike rate of 50, well done Jadhav.",10
7(12). FML.,3
Why did Dhoni come out so early today?,1
"It's quite sad to see Jadhav like this, he used to be one of the players I was afraid to see SA playing against.",3
Lol he really didn't connect a single one,2
Jadhav sus,12
Jadhav is confused I'm sure. He thinks they need 3 runs of 25 balls.,12
Drop jadav from the IPL not just csk. Smh,9
"Why isn't Bravo batting, I have even seen Karn Sharma hit sixes in the past. Chahar and Thakur aren't too bad either. No excuse for CSK to defend in 18th over when they need 15+ an over",2
How TF do Watson and Faf cruise through last match and then you have this shit the very next match,2
And thats why jadeja shud have gotten more of the strike,2
"Honestly man, Jadhav the entire tournament has looked like he doesn't want to be there lol. Atleast Jadeja's shown urgency today.",3
Not a fan of Karthik's captaincy but his decision to back spinners in death today was a masterstroke.,7
The CSK era has ended.,3
"Lol@CSK Jadhav and Jadeja instead of Curran and Bravo

Edit: As the comment below points out, Curran was out at this point",2
"Jadhav is actually an extremely elaborate money laundering scheme. 

Also Jadeja hit a six now lmao.",10
Lord jhadav best KKR player 👏,8
Let’s talk about the brilliant captaincy of DK. Shall we?,7
"CSK were cruising, their middle order is horrible.",7
Take a run once the game is done and dusted (゜o゜;,3
Csk fans we don’t mind losing to KKR. DK namma ooru dhan,2
Good strategy by Dinesh Karthik to bring Narine late.,4
"Thala: Fook the INTENT, I'll play my way from now on",3
CSK batting for KKR's NRR.,3
Me to jadhav : fuck you and I will see you next game,9
Jadhav doing what he does best.,1
Nice nice shot jaddu.. atleast you are showing some spine unlike useless Jadhav..,4
Jaddu showing why Jadhav is hated so much.,6
jadhav playing for kkr!,3
CSK reaches the tail after the top 3.,3
That six looks even more hilarious after Jadhavs batting 😂,5
CSK seem to have misinterpreted the NRR column for the points column probably,6
I'd rather blame the people who keep picking the underperformers rather than the underperformers.,7
Ah yes jadeja doing a dhoni when the match is gone,3
Captaincy masterclass. Honestly give DK and Morgan MotM.,6
Jadhav thinks he could pull a Tewatia. Useless fuck. I can't believe we are losing this match.,4
ChoSKers!,1
"That 6 is just applying salt on the wounds. Fuck you Jadhav, useless fucking twat",4
How to lose a winning game? Watch today’s match highlights,7
OMG my perfect day ruined! Kedar seriously with bravo sitting,1
CSK and the last over NRR 6s.,7
FUCK I was hoping for a maiden over,2
Too late from Jadeja,2
Dhoni looks so unbelievably mad at jhadav holy shit,6
"Yep classic CSK, showing intent^TM after the game is lost",6
Even Chahar or Thakur would have done better than Jadhav,2
What were Csk smoking when they paid 7.8 cr for this. That would be some high quality shit,2
"Bravo, Thakur, Watson, Faf, Dhoni watching Jadhav bottle everything : 👁️👄👁️",3
Two minutes of silence for over-enthusiastic CSK fans who were pumped after 10 wickets win in the last match.,15
Dhoni's masterclass: come up the order so that no one blames you for not being able to finish the game.,12
Bruh now they hit,3
The real treasure is the nrr we got along the way,7
Time for some NRR damage limitation now 😂😂😂,7
REMINDER: Kedar Jadhav and Andre Russel get paid the same amount of money!,18
[deleted],6
"After M Vijay, Jadhav plays his last IPL game for CSK.",9
Ind vs Eng wc19 flashbacks,7
i would rather play another bowler than having Jadhav in the team.,3
Jadhav you fucking muppet. Not even prepared to put up a fight. What a terrible attitude to have for a professional.,10
Few Csk fanbase is so toxic that I am starting to enjoy csk failure.,23
"Csk: Look at me, i am the choker now.",7
Thanks Kedar Jadhav you are the game changer,10
Lmao jadeja immediately hits a 6 when he gets strike,15
Omg that sarcastic Fleming smile was golden,9
Wtf is wrong with Chennai? You know smt is bad when an RCB fan is worried about you.,27
Jadhav looking like a huge fool on national tv,7
Hope Jaddu leaves Jadhav hanging when he comes over for the fist bump,4
Russell has to pull a ngidi if csk wanna win,2
Jadhav can FUCK OFF!!!,5
Jadeja deserves a better team than CSK,2
My whole understanding of the game has been brought into question by DK and Jadhav!,4
Jadhav will be speaking on behalf of the wining captain today /s,12
Aww yes 360 strike rate after the match is lost.,8
Dhoni in spirit for the last three balls...,6
"Honestly I'm only invested in CSK games for my boy Sam Curran, but these performances are starting to get me depressed even though Sammy's playing well  - can only imagine how proper fans feel lmao",17
Lol Jadhav,1
No ball 6 makes this interesting,3
"Jadeja doing a Thala here.

Hitting sixes after rr is above 36",20
Atleast we can have good company with CSK at bottom of the table. boys (RR and kings xi) we have new friend this year.,10
[deleted],12
This is just depressing.,5
Here comes the NRR six,5
I would rather take Tuk Tuk Dhoni,8
WTF? Jadhav didn't even try.,4
So Jadeja has picked up the stat-pad ability from Dhoni.,10
Jesus 7 (12) in a run chase is simply unacceptable,9
How did CSK lose this ? WTF?,6
Jadhav is just Uthappa in yellow,7
Bravo can’t bat can he?,3
Jadeja following the footsteps of Dhoni.,5
CSK deserves to lose because of they play Jadhav,4
Aur ye bhosdika Jadhav Jadeja ko strike nahi de raha tha. smh!,11
Thala mini has lost the game.,13
NRR^TM,3
"If Dhoni doesn't drop Jadhav for next match. He is a fucking pussy and hypocrite. 

I am sorry but someone has to say it. 

This is fucking stupid.",17
No ball six no ball six still lose,2
Quantum of loss ™,2
"jadhav is done , doesn't fit in this squad at all",7
CSK reducing the quantum of loss again today...,8
Jadeja giving death stare to Jadhav after each boundary.,14
Jadeja lowkey just hit those to show Jadhav he would’ve won them the match if he gave him strike,11
just don't bowl a no ball.,4
"Come on jadhav, thought you were a fan of Salman Khan.  You just need to hit and run.",33
Jadeja playing for the NRR.,11
Hopefully this is a big enough reason to finally bench Jadhav,3
CsK iS bACk,9
Ah yes jadhav the game finisher,9
Just fuckin drop this shitty batsman for fucks sake!!,9
Fucking Jadhav god dammit. Have some shame man.,20
We need a DK apology thread,12
No ball!! 2 above the shoulders!!,1
How Jadhav came in ahead of Jadeja/Bravo is troubling,9
That's what CSK gets for boring me to death last season,6
The hell does baz notes down so much?,9
Quantum of Loss™,9
Jeez... Didn't know Russel could bowl 140KMPH+,9
NRR management there... top class,8
">Remember, if a player performs well, credit goes to Dhoni for trusting him. If not it's players fault and his fault alone

Abhishek from Hyderabad on hotstar gets it.",36
"Jadhav wasted 5 balls, fucking idiot. Fuck him.",13
It was so natural to think that Jadeja should have come to bat before Jadhav but I don't know what Stephen Fleming or Dhoni is thinking or smoking to make such decision.,24
Seriously Jadeja?,1
Royal Super Kings,5
Lmao SRK still not convinced. Think he probably remembers that mortaza over vs Rohit,11
Classic CSK. Knew it that spinners will do it for KKR. too much unnecessary tuk tuk,4
Kedar Jadhav MoM for his solid 7 of 12,28
Jadhav is definitely involved in something seedy,17
If this happened 3 balls ago lol,14
Fuck me DK DADDY,11
Smh CSK middle order. They were cruising the chase at one point,16
This is so enjoyable!,10
"JADHAV 7* (12) 

JADHAV 7* (12)

JADHAV 7* (12)",27
Fuck off Kedar.,8
Csk should start a drinking container company with how good they are at bottling everything,13
"Next time when Kedar asks for bat change, they should show ""Eat Shit"" board",24
Jadhav's biggest contribution these days is his height that helps draw a no ball here and there.,14
Hitting boundaries after the game is lost.. Jadeja learning from the best in business,14
I love how Jadhav thought that he had the call to not take a run.,8
how tha fuck did they lose lmao??,8
"19 in 2 balls, idk guys they can pull it off./s",1
Jadeja should come in at 4. Curran and bravo following. Dhoni and jadhav only seem to increase required run rate.,6
"7\*(12).  
I made a joke about 153-5. Fck me.",7
Lol. Jadhav denied a single on the first ball,9
Jadhav ko nikalo behenchod.,4
Jadhav's last IPL game?,6
bloody fucking manlet cunt.,2
Brilliant captaincy by Dhoni. Kept backing his key players regardless of how they played. Masterclass,6
Ofcourse Behenchod you come close and lose,2
Bring Gaikwad in for Jadhav and move Faf down the order to strengthen this non-existent middle order.,3
"Wow, CSK bigger chokes than South Africa.",2
Props to jadeja for palying for NRR,6
Jadeja did his part. Not his fault he wasn’t given strike earlier.,11
It’s funny to hear CSK theme song after each 4,4
Jadhav about to become the first MVP for 7 different teams in the same season,3
NRR,1
Atleast the NRR is saved /s,1
Fucking Jadhav,1
 me right now: (⌐■-■),1
LMAO hitting sixes after they've lost,3
Hopefully Jadhav gets the Dream11 game changer of the match. He changed the match in KKR's favour!,8
"CSK were just playing for run-rate all along. They just wanted to make the game mathematic impossible so
opposition could throw them some dollies.",8
Respect for DK restored. Excellent captaincy.,-1
"Literally if Jadeja batted alone taking 2,4,6 alone CSK would have had a better chance to win this one. What a useless innings from Jadhav.",5
Post-2016-Peak-Dhoni finish by Jadeja. Hit boundaries in a lost cause lmao,8
I am just here to lol.,7
"JADHAV 7* (12) 

JADHAV 7* (12)

FUCK YOU JADHAV. FUCK YOU JADHAV MOTHERFUCKER,2
"Sorry CSK,it was not KXIP but KKR.",3
RIP Jadhav's IPL career 2012-2020,2
The DJ is a fucking plastic lmaaaoooo. Why chant KKr after the match.,7
Now we need 6 out of 8 games right??,2
This was one of the weirder matches I have seen.,6
CSK grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory.,10
I know Dhoni trust his players and he’s persistent but Jadhav is a consistently poor performer. Why is he still in the playing 11?,8
Csk back to form.,8
7(12) is pathetic coming in towards the end of a chase,9
"Everyone knows the only reason Jadhav stays in the team, is because he's BFFs with Dhoni, another reason I've started to dislike the way he's been captaining",6
Doesn't Suhana have classes to attend? What's she doing at the ground?,-1
Jadhav needs to go but CSK don't even have any replacement for him.,3
RIP Jadhav's Career.,8
"Jadeja scoring 14 off the last 3 balls to further rub it in that Jadhav cost them the match with his batting, should have just blocked and ran singles",9
"So Jadhav basically lost CSK two games single handedly

3(10) and 7(12)",11
OMG! Is Jadhav braindead or something?,5
So the last performance was just a one off throwback?,2
Quantum of loss achieved,5
"JADHAV 7* (12) 

JADHAV 7* (12)

JADHAV 7* (12)",12
Hats off to KKR. The better team won.,3
Daaaaammmmmnnn Jaddu shoulda had more of the strike,5
CSK went from winning the match to losing the match before I could drive back to home. What a turnaround.,4
None of us our batsmen other than Tripathi could even score 20 but we fucking won.,11
Jadhav returning to the dugout *swag se karenge sab ka swaagat intensifies*,6
"Points are temporary, NRR is forever",16
Man if Jadeja would have been on strike they could have come closer.,5
Super Kings is such a stupid name LMFAO they deserve it.,1
Dhoni and Kedar kill a promising chase? Who could have ever seen this coming?,9
"So technically, two dot balls by Jadhav made csk lose",8
"If I was jaddu now, I would have slapped Kedar hard instead of a fist-five",22
Dhoni trying to relive his past glory only to choke the run rate,6
Thala didn't tell Jadhav to save the NRR it seems,6
Fucking SRK is the only thing that I hate about this team.,9
Well that was very anti climatic,3
Bro Jadhav killed his own career,11
NNR saved yay,5
Today Raina was desperately needed in place of Jadhav.,8
Narine's 17(8) made the difference in the end.,5
Waiting for MSD's excuses now,5
Sir Jadeja playing as specialist batsman at no.7,4
jadhav MotM for KKR for not taking that single on 1st ball.,2
Jadeja's last 3 boundaries were a part of msd's mission nrr,15
"How lovely it burns.

Not going to lie, it's so satisfying to see CSK choke and fade away.

Feel a tad bit sorry to see Dhoni struggle, but he really should have retired on a high. It's his choice entirely to put himself through this, after batting for 2 overs he looks tired as if he's batted the entire 50 in an ODI.",10
Jadhav fr was denting singles.,3
Hopefully end of Jadhav’s IPL career. Only silver lining,7
Holy shit. How just How ??,6
Jadhav you motherfucker,2
I've no skin in the game but I am feeling angry on behalf of the CSK lot.,7
"This win is going to wonders for the KKR bowling line-up's confidence!

In batting, it was one bad day. They got the batting order right. I am (cautiously) hopeful!",2
"Kedar Jadhav 7(12)

NEVER FORGET!!",16
Camera pans to KKR skip Morgan,6
Jadhav went to the Dhoni school of batting,7
Jadhav is MoTM along with MS Dhoni,6
If bravo and Jaddu were at the crease we would have lost,2
So far dhoni has score of 0 in winning matches for csk. Moral of the story for other teams : let him bat and win matches.,5
Those last 3 shots by Jaddu was a fuck you to Jadhav and the team management which keeps selecting him.,11
"Don't blame Jadhav, guys. Everyone knows he can't hit sixes for shit. Blame Fleming and Dhoni for not sending in Bravo, a ready made six hitter, when the RR was 13.",22
"If hitting useless boundaries is an art, CSK is the best at it.",9
Really fucking hate how they keep panning to SRK's face after every win.,11
Jadhav after being on 5 from 7 deliveries changed his bat just to score 2 more runs in the final 5 balls. Brilliant,17
"Now people will see this Jadeja innings and say he should play for India in t20s. Ignoring that he might be a liability bowling wise as seen today. Krunal, Axar, Sundar there are better guys ahead of him in t20s.",8
[deleted],1
Bitch ass jadhav fuck you,9
Why is DK apologising to umpires?,3
"So many tamil nadu players shinning in the ipl this year.

I hope everyone one of them performs well against chennai for not buying the young talent available there.",2
Where the kkr fans at?,2
Hopefully this is the straw that breaks the camel's back when it comes to CSK picking Jadhav for every match,8
DK trying to convince the umpire to not fine him for a slow over rate is so adorable,10
CSK totally gave away this match to KKR.,10
"Hindsight is 20/20. DK’s move today makes him look like a genius, but it could have easily backfired. Bowling atleast an over of Narine to Watson early is what any sensible captain would have done, so people getting angry at him was not unprecedented.

Credits to DK though, under fire as a captain and not performing with the bat he comes up with this
balls of steel move",24
I need therapy,11
MSD and Fleming should have fought hard for Raina against Srini.,12
"Lmao, Karthik looks like a completely different man.",3
"These last few boundaries are so fuckin frustrating I swear, and I hardly give a shit about CSK.",13
"Jadhav's strike rate: 58

The guy he refused the single to's strike rate: 262

CSK are memeing harder this season than even RCB could ever have hoped to.",36
"Till 2019 : hangon , csk can still win this .
2020 : hangon, csk can still lose this.",10
"If Jhadav gets to play again, then there is something else going on inside CSK",10
NRR achieved.,6
KKR will be laughing that they didn't had to put much effort to win this match. Match came automatically in their hands,6
This. Is. Criminal.,6
"CSK loses: it’s the team that lost not Dhoni’s fault. 

CSK wins: we are only winning because of Thala.",17
"Two dot balls from jadav in the last over,what a shame",6
Why the fuck do you send Kedar Jadhav. Something is really fishy ?,9
Jadega coming so late is brain dead management,6
Lord Jadhav - Vice President of Thala academy of tuk tuk cricket 😂😂😂,3
"As a non dhoni fan, I don't want him to be sent off to retirement like this. But karma hits back",9
Last minute boundaries- just CSK things.,8
Dk is best captain.,2
Still wasn't clever at all of DK to make narine bowl the 19 th over. Somebody make Morgan the captain,1
Jadhav is completely out of touch. Find a decent youngster and back him. This guy is terrible.,6
This is what Jadhav did in the match against England,7
"Rayudu shouldnt have gone for that shot, when he was with watto score board was ticking and slowly cruising towards victory. May the he was asked to hit or get out ? So others can finish it",7
"Best thing about Dhoni performance in CSK match day is the mental gymnastics he does in post match presentation.

  


Best part comming up.",21
Jadhav ka Jadu in this match.,3
"If Jadhav's 7(12) was 17(12), CSK could have won.",19
"I think Jadhav is in the team these days only to make Dhoni's innings look less bad, I'm not even joking.",36
We will not qualify for playoffs. DELHI OR MI will win this IPL season.,9
Jadhav... The most clueless batsman I've probably seen on the crease,10
"Thank you, Jadhav",7
Dear Dhoni please have more faith in Jadhav and play him next match against us,27
"Russell is my fantasy team captain. This is like my worst case scenario, what a bad finish.",3
Jadeja paying respect to thala by keeping the nrr under check,9
CSK reserve their best only for RCB 1.0 and RCB 2.0,9
Yesssss let's gooooooo,0
"What has csk done here , they players who can bat till 11 still didn't chased a tad above 160 + score here",8
"It's not even that CSK lost the match. It's how they lose the match. They almost bat themselves out of the chase. But congrats to KKR. I was questioning why Narine wasn't brought in early on. Or why Russell, their most economical bowler, wasn't being bowled. But having Narine bowl his 4 in the back end really changed the game. Along with the youngsters who were almost as effective as Narine.",15
NRR specialist Jadeja.,10
"MSD brilliance of going for big shots in last 3 balls means they keep up with the NRR. Take that all you Dhoni haters......


/s",12
If I was Jadhav Myself i will get a flight back to India.,8
Is Dhoni going to proud of Jadhav or is he going to be proud?,7
Waiting for MS's interview,5
Jadhav deserves The MoM today,12
Hello darkness my old friend.,11
"Drop Jadhav and play Gaikwad or you know what, give  Jagadeesan a shot. Anything better than that short sack of shit wasting balls cause he can't clear the 30 yard circle.",7
Jaddu learning from thalla on how to keep up your strike rate in a losing match,18
Jsdhav's 12 balls cost them the game tbh.,11
Someone please take jadhav to Antarctica and throw him in whale poop gutter😡😡.. absolute shit...,12
"Today's match kkr played trash, but then there was someone who played worse.... The points table is not doing justice for rcb, based on how shit kkr campaign has been (rcb improve the nrr ffs)",12
What makes me mad isn't Dhoni's terrible form. It's the poor management. I am very happy with Dhoni being the specialist captain and excellent wicketkeeper. But fuck he can't even give me that now?,8
"KKR was shit  , Csk was just bigger shit",29
Jadhav is useless. Send him back to India.,13
CSK is better off playing a 10 man team without Jadhav,6
"Honestly great to see DK and Morgan smiling at each other

Dudes have worked well together",12
Jadhav you piece of shit,9
That shave job actually worked for DK lol,14
"They sent Jadhav before Bravo. What the hell were they thinking? Fucking deserve it, dumbfucks.",7
Only team to think NRR matter more than points the moment after they lose 3 wickets,14
Only Sam Curran played with intent.,14
Some positives for us- Watson is truly back. Faf is in good nick. Rayudu is a stabilizing presence. Our bowling overall is great IMO,4
Fucking jadav!!! Why the hell is he in the team and why the hell didnt bravo came before him,3
The worst thing about CSK matches is that they don't even try after 15 overs. Look very sus for fixing.,11
Jadhav has no business playing any cricket outside of Ranji trophy.,10
"Honestly Narine spell at the end and small cameo in batting made difference. Well done Narine.

 r/Cricket can eat shit for shit talking about DK and Narine.",31
Jadeja's last few hits rubs salt into Jadhav doing fuck all in the start of the over,9
Fuck Jadhav. Fuck Jadhav. Fuck Jadhav.,6
Lmao i thought I'd see some action tuning into the last two overs but I saw a classic CSK type finish,6
"I bet Jadhav wouldn't have scored even those 7 runs if the scoreboard said ""7 required off 12""",7
Obviously Jadhav was promoted so that his 7(12) takes everybody's eyes off Dhoni's 11(12),10
Seems like the plan was to hold Narine till Dhoni came. Worked out pretty well tbh!,8
"**Kedar Jadhav** : 7(12)

**Ravindra Jadeja** : 21(8)

Jadhav is going to be brutally trolled from toxic CSK fanbase. Should take social media detox this season.",16
KKR has a NRR of +0.00. Perfectly balanced.,14
"**Kedar Jadhav batting in IPL for CSK**

257 balls

243 runs

Run Rate: 5.90",22
"it’s the end of a cycle for CSK... they’ll clear the board next year, keep curran and maybe jadeja and rebuild from there. The owners there have been running and involved in cricket for a longggg time. and yeah MS retires from ipl by then or opens and retires after the season",1
Really funny seeing all of us do a 180 on DK,8
I feel cheated in every CSK match. Not that I support them. But it just feels they aren't even trying,14
So DK did manage to fuck r/cricket. Albiet a different way,13
We need to fr drop jadhav man.,7
"I thought Jadhav would shit on r/cricket today, wow feels good to be wrong/s",9
"Long live Dhoni and his strategies!

Like what a clusterfuck, if you are one down by the 14th over, the match should be over. But no, let’s take it deep!",15
CSK rushing to lose this as hard as possible.,3
"Even if Jadhav could have scored run a ball with one lucky edge, this could have been a different scene.",6
Why would you send Jadhav in place of Bravo?,1
"Yesterday I asked why was Krunal Pandya in team, but seeing Jadhav he looks 100 times better.",5
"If you can kick vijay, you can kick jadhav too... literally anyone would have played better than him wtf",4
Holy crap Dhoni is a God with that bod!!!,2
Literally made a reddit account because i'm so fucking angry - bottling what should've been a easy win!,12
I bet Tripathi this game as opener made more runs than Narine in total last season as opener,11
"I, for one, am finding CSK to be the most entertaining team to watch this year. Who else can make 160 chases look like a 220 chase and a 220 chase look like a 300 chase this consistently",19
"So many people on twitter said Jadhav and Dhoni batted like that in the WC game against England to get Pakistan disqualified, but, the simpler explanation, they were no longer batsmen who could win, might also have some merit",26
I apologise for calling DK dumb.,20
Remember the 7.8 crores,7
"If Jadhav doesn’t get kicked out after this, CSK MANAGEMENT & Dhoni are super fucking RETARDED",9
Someone please tally how much dhoni and jadhav scored in how many balls. They both alone are the reason CSK derailed from the chase.,4
I changed my mind about dk. Good dude,11
MoM: K Jadhav,5
CSK without fixed matches...,5
I am pretty sure it's not Jadhav who selects himself and takes decision about his batting order. Blame the ones who despite such performances keep him in the team.,5
Bruh they scored almost if not 90 off first 10 overs and only needed almost 70 runs off 60 balls or something? Wtf,5
Lol Chakravarty taking pictures with dhoni,14
"Other reason could be that Jadhav plays like Dre Russell in nets, and Dhoni decided to wait for him to shine on ground.

Or, they all are morons.",11
[deleted],11
[deleted],17
Who can come in place of Jadhav?,5
"If Jadhav isn’t dropped after this match, I’m gonna think there’s some serious inside shit happening or Jadhav knows really bad secrets about Dhoni/Srini",15
Jadhav and Dhoni were the imposters in the team,19
Bit of a pet peeve of mine when commentators pronounce Cummins as CumminGs,5
Bravo died twice for this.,9
Perfect execution in setting up the loss by Jadhav,6
".msds traumatic face in the dugout says it all.

either he fears for his tuk tuk replacement or he fears there's a force greater than him in the team.",5
Now watch as CSK beats RCB this Saturday.,6
Switch to English commentary for Dhoni interview,3
"I usually try to think that ""these selectors are professionals"" and ""they're the best in the world"" but bruh",5
Jaddu gonna take his Rajput sword tonight and cut Jadhav up and CSK successfully asks and finds a good replacement.,10
"Couldn’t chase 167 when they needed 68 of 48 with 9 wickets in hand. Yeah sure CSK haven’t declined. 

I blame Jadhav.

How dare I blame the guy who took the momentum away when he came on to bat at 4 by playing dot balls and getting out for 11 of 11. 

CSK are going through what India have been with Dhoni in the team. Let’s blame everyone else but him. Making easy chases hard. Putting pressure on other players and then blaming them. 

Jadhav was trash but that doesn’t make your so called thala blameless. If you give him all the credit when he wins, give him equal blame when you lose. He creates more losses than wins when he is actually needed. 

Have some shame you can’t even hide by blaming the top order today.

Also if Dhoni had pulled off what DK did today, we would hear about it from every Fucking person for months. Hope he gets some love from the media and commentators.",31
So CSK thought Bravo is not better than Jadhav😑. Not sure what MS and Flemming saw in him,11
Is it still possible to make the playoffs?,-1
You can take the match as deep as you want but you are not making it deep into the tournament.,7
"People criticized DK as captain, but his decision to hold back Narine and use him when the pitch was slowest was brilliant.",27
To think Jadhav has been a regular in the Indian team smh,16
Csk has lost in every game kedhar came on to bat.,7
Someone ask Dhoni whether Jadhav is in the team just to make him look good,11
"Jadhav faced 50% more deliveries than Jadeja, and scored 1/3rd the runs, and he is the big hitting batsman while Jadeja is the bowling allrounder. Jeez",17
You (jadhav) vs the guy she says not to worry about (tewatia),24
How shit is KIXP that they lose against this team by 10 wickets,11
Did MSD say Karan or Curran?,4
Dhoni send Jadhav before Bravo so everyone could blame him after he shat too LMAO,11
"Have to admit, SRK is a lucky charm for KKR. Whenever he comes to see the matches, KKR mostly wins. 💜",7
Jadhav showcasing how to defend in 17th over ..,8

Bravo looked sad.,3
Bishop is too nice to ask hard hitting questions.,5
We were one wicket away from this smh,10
Does Jadhav have Dhoni's or Fleming's nudes or what,9
Commentators saying Dhoni's wicket was turning point of the match. Wtf,14
“Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don't try it without that 10 per cent.”,11
Bravo looks distraught,7
"To be honest, I have no issue with KKR's batting order today. Kudos to captain for that. I'm not sure about the some bowling choices he made, but then again they did well at end. So for today, it's good. 
Surely an improved captain today.",9
"Lol everyone blaming Jhadhav but not the more senior Dhoni. Also who sends Jhadav at 17 over, ahead of Bravo?",15
Damn Bravo looks angry,7
Jadhav wasn't even trying. Looks like he's already cashed his cheques.,14
"Jadhav will play, because he's the best option they've got. There's not a single Indian or even foreign batsman on the bench who could replace him, the best is Gaikwad who's an opener and didn't do well.

Jadhav is an international name at the very least. Their decision not to get an Indian batsman after Raina's leave is hurting them, they either need a batsman or simply push Jadhav to 7 (or 8 when Bravo plays) where he can't hurt when it matters.

Dhoni, Curran, and Jadeja as the middle order (4-5-6).",13
"When you try the same tired out-of-date approach and game strategy game in, game out, you are going to be found out as a team. Add insipid coaching and bizarre captaincy and what you get is this shitshow.

Let's not even talk about short sighted squad building with zero focus on developing young talent. Feel sorry for genuine CSK fans.",11
Lol I just checked a CSK insta page fans are not uttering a word for Dhoni and everyone is on Jadhav,20
My soul is hurting after watching this. I should seriously give up on CSK and find some other team. This trauma is not worth at all.,10
Great match boys. Onto the next one.,4
Jadhav: Things change. Being shit is constant,10
LMAO how did MI and KXIP ever lose to this lot defending a total too?!,29
Anybody remember when Jadhav actually used to score well for Delhi along with JP Duminy.,19
"**Most unsuccessful chases for CSK in an IPL season**

5 in 2013

4 in 2020 (in only 6 matches)

McCullum needs to publish the notes he’s writing as a manual for captains and coaches.,13
"Man it looked like Narine and Baz were consoling Bravo, and prolly he was upset that he wasn't promoted :/",17
Still think Narine early would have been as effective if not more.,9
[removed],21
Nice to see Mcculum and Narine trying to cheer Bravo up. Bravo is from the Knight Riders family in TKR,20
"Watson

Gaikwad

Faf

Rayudu

Dhoni

Curran 

Jadeja

Bravo

This should probably be CSK's batting lineup next game",22
lol this was embarrassing to watch,10
Wish they had the guts to ask him why his batting has completely disappeared,3
Bravo seems really unhappy.. complaining about something..,15
"I'm fine with losing, honestly, but if you don't try at ALL when you have other options..

I'm done with CSK in the ipl lol, especially when MS leaves after this year",6
Commentators absolutely murdered dk for not bowling sunil early if dhoni would have done the same they would have called it a masterstroke,29
MS indirectly called Jadhav a dumbass,20
"I still can't wrap my head around how CSK lose chasing 160 odd so many times and none of Bravo, Thakur gets to bat. It's pretty simple RRR goes over 10 you start hitting, atleast one batsman will have a good day.",10
"Man, I never supprted CSK. My brother is hard-core CSK fan and I am SRH but this year I supporting CSK because I want it to be Rayudu's redemption IPL but the way they are losing and seeing dhoni feels bad. 

When SRH lose I feel pain, but CSK losing giving me sad vibes. They should have won this match. SMH",7
Was just looking at CSK bench. They only have Ruturaj Gaikwad who could come in for Jadhav.,11
Good thing Watson scored good today so you can criticize Thala and not receive replies like 'madarchodh what can Thala do if top order fails',37
Shardul Thakur could have won this game for CSK. He is certainly a better batsman than this clown in T20s,11
Guess we're the meme team now.,30
"CSK fans: but we always make the playoffs!

Just don’t be too sad when you don’t because there is no way you are!",12
And I thought Australia's choke in first T20I against England last month was the worst I would see this year,8
Don't just blame jadhav. Dhoni did incredibly in bottling that too,30
So Dhoni and Jadhav scored 18 in 24 balls combined. They both are the reason why Watson had to go for shot unnecessarily in narine's over and Sam Curran has to hit in Russell's over and get out.,25
Am I the only one or is Morgan a bit too active today on the Field compared to the previous matches,12
"Jadhav playing as pure batsman is bad at every level. I don't think he will be dropped but he should be. CSK could instead give a long rope to Ruturaj or maybe Jagadeesan, atleast if they come good they will have a future in the club maybe even an addition to the queue for Indian team.",12
"Watson and Rayudu not blameless in slowing down and adding to scoreboard pressure!

EDIT: I know I’m getting downvoted, but Watto went from 47(33) to 50 (40), while Rayudu went from 24(17) to 30(27). In total, that’s 9 runs in 17 balls",-14
Stellar contribution by jadhav with bat in guaranteeing defeat for his side.,7

Jhadav Sorry but finally I saw a 4 feet pile of sh\*\* today.,18
Lord Jadhav,11
[removed],24
Other teams back themselves to chase 50+ in last 3 or 4 overs and here is CSK who shit the bed in the second half of the chase. CSK seems to be evolving backwards.,24
We can get that sweet no. 5 spot if we win tomorrow,10
"The match Dhoni shows intent, he lacks power. And then when he has that timing, he lacks intent",16
"Looking at KKR's bowling figures, it's quite clear that the cunning use of bowlers was the reaosn they won the game, not any one particular performance.",11
Masterclass 7(12) by Jadhav. That was reason he was in WC 2019 squad,18
Might as well play Chawla in place of Jadhav. He can smoke 6s better than jadhav imo.,22
"> Dhoni failed as a batsman 

> Dhoni failed as a captain 

> Everyone but him and Jadhav contributed, and sending in Jadhav was his (and Fleming's) blunder. 

Where are all the Thala-tards who were crying that he didn't get enough support. He's not a finisher. He's finished. Simple.",24
Bruh how did CSK lose this??,11
And CSK paid 7crores for this guy!,15
"Obviously the post match show begins with a 2 minute speech on Dhoni. Then briefly mention KKR, then go back to Dhoni.",20
See you guys on Twitter and FB for meltdown. GG & Love you KKR!😘,17
Scoring 157/5 in 20 overs when all of your 11 batsman can bat is........ Bad,17
"Felt sad for bravo when I saw him distraught, talking to Narine and McCullum and it felt like they were consoling him or something? Lol",10
I liked the captaincy for using the strike bowler Cummins as a strike bowler. Forget about everything else like holding back Narine.,8
"I feel for Sam Curran. He’s a real star but I can’t seeing him going far with this team . Eoin Morgan is a natural born leader , he is a bit like Ben Stokes in that he is a great captain . But he does not need that title to be a leader on the field and in  dressing room, and players respect him.",11
"How poetic that KKR makes all the bad batting order changed throughout and eventually win because CSK didn't send Bravo in. Lol

Today was quite literally a battle of the worst.",26
Lol Chakravarthy is having a fanboi moment with Thala,31
"This IPL table looks so shaky

Everything is super unpredictable",18
"Man I feel bad for Dhoni... all these years he built up the responsibility of finishing games easily and increased expectations, and now suddenly he’s just lost touch and there’s nothing he can do about it.",-4
I must say cSK iS bAcK iN fORm,14
Koi baat ni lads spare him maybe he is playing his last ipl,10
Kedar is the definition of a 0D player. Cant believe this clown gets 7.8 crores.,15
Jadhav is Sus af,13
"Dk deserves appreciation for using bowlers smartly.   
Narine bowled difficult overs and using Russell for last 2 overs instead of young bowlers was brilliant.   
This is a capable team and should go a distance,  just dk back in form will be a plus.",23
That Jagadeeshan guy has not played a single match for CSK despite being with them since last 3 years. Iam pretty sure picking him cannot be much worse than Jadhav.,40
Need to win atleast 6 of the 8 matches to qualify now?,14
Jadhav thought he was going to pull a Tewatia in the last over but instead he pulled a Jadhav.,113
"Guys, I think I figured it out. Based on the commentary this IPL, CSK only lost this because the master of the chase Dhoni got out.",25
BBC Russell choked CSK into submission.,38
Hahahha wtf,14
This match reminds me of GG days of kkr where he had too many bowling options and spinners deliver big time,11
69 runs needed off 48 deliveries with 9 wickets remaining and yet they took it DEEP™ enough to lose,21
"So I did the math, CSK has lost 4 matches batting second, and adding up the runs scored once the match was theoretically impossible to win, they scored 50(20)


And that is including 7(8) vs DC",16
"Yes after 10-15 minutes of Dhoni, actually remember that Tripathi batted in the first innings",-1
"It's good to see streetsmart Jadhav's still in that ""England match"" mode",9
Why the F did he change bats in the middle of the over anyway? LMAO,15
"Before you shit on CSK, note that they achieved their NRR goals to help them finish 7th in the season.",12
CSK being RCB (oh sorry..... CSK being CSK*),7
Get Chawla back in for Jadhav and that forces DJ to bat higher. Better for both batting and bowling.,7
Kedar Jadhav needs rest!,3
[deleted],21
"Failing to chase below 170  5 wickets down is simply pathetic , Jadhav being a tad selfish didn't even took a single 2 ball last over think 1_2 sixes there would help him lol",7
"Yeah jadhav saved them in MI vs CSK 2018, but don't forget Bravo set up the platform for him",12
"Honestly it's hard to support CSK when they constantly pull shit like this. Bravo was visibly fucking annoyed. Jadhav is a fucking liability everywhere. He needs to be hidden in the field, doesn't even bowl anymore and actively sabotages run chases.

Yet if Dhoni and Fleming continue with him and keep promoting him ahead of better T20 batsmen, they can go screw themselves. Don't remember being annoyed at any other non-home team.",58
"If this is not the end of Kedar Jadhav's career, I would be very surprised.",14
"4th time in a 20 days Csk lost it chasing , cuz of Jadhav and MSD",12
I am depressed,12
"All done and dusted, I'm happy that MSD showed some guts today. If it didn't happen for him, then there's nothing he can do more.",9
Jadhav did well to see the day through without losing his wicket...oh wait...,22
"Looking at how bad people are trolling Jadhav over here, won't be surprised if he scores a 20 ball 50 next time, given r/cricket 's history.",18
"Jadhav does a Dhoni: dude can’t bat, that’s the last we will see of him.

Dhoni does a Dhoni: did you look at his commitment for the team!",38
"Guys, I missed this match, What's up with Bravo?? Why everyone talking about him?",8
Lmao what did Faf even do to get that award,22
What the fuck man,6
I just want to know who gives 7 cr to Kedar Jadhav CSK or other teams.,18
"Do you reckon CSK retaining Dhoni for **16 crores** next 2 season? 

He's still icon for CSK, but at what cost? Even Sachin for MI didn't play after 40",23
KKR be glad they did not try to take Jadhav's wicket.,12
Calm down guys it's just an ipl match.,-1
YOOOO why did DK shave lmao,4
Tripathi having the time of his life out there. He has been smiling all day 😇,16
"I saw Kedar Jadhav asking Dhoni in dugout, are you going? Like WTF dude! What you gonna do even if he sends you? It's not a test match dude. 3 dot balls at the very start. Super disappointed.",9
I expect Jadhav will be given MOM.,4
DK's cheeks are seeing sunlight after ages,11
"Watching Cricbuzz Hindi post match is really funny, Ajay Jadeja be sucking on Dhoni and Sehwag be laughing in the corner laughing at Ajay",15
Are ma homies fed up with blaming Dhenier every single time and have shifted the blame baton to Kedar?,15
Chennai super Kings-of-cant-finish-any-games,4
I am pretty sure CSK will not pick Jadhav in next auction. I'll will be curious to see who picks him or if he is picked after these kind of performances.,10
Its not that we lost. But the fact that we didn't utilise bravo and thakur is just sad. Dont send jadhav when we have to accelerate wtf.,16
Okay why does CSK pack their team with bat deep hitters if their strategy is not to hit out anyway lol.,11
Dil chahta hai beard was the key today.,3
Bravo and Thakur still to bat and we get 7*(12) EPIC!,12
"Jadhav should've been the game changer of the match, completely changed the game for KKR.",12
Jadhav is an impostor. I saw him killing CSK,30
CSK would be better off picking an uncapped batsman than have Jadhav in the mix.,10
DK looking so different now without the beard! I think this look suits him better.,7
"**Teams to beat CSK In (India, SA, UAE)**

Delhi Capitals

**Kolkata Knight Riders**",21
[deleted],31
"It's cute CSK/Thala fanboys questioning Jadhav's ""intent"".",28
I just wanna be like Harsha - always happy & enjoying,12
"DK was gifted a second life by CSK, he would have taken all the warth Dhoni+Jadhav are facing.",22
"**Most balls faced in IPL2020 without hitting a six**

59 Kedar Jadhav

48 Dinesh Karthik

44 Glenn Maxwell

42 Robin Uthappa",34
"This is the result of batting a proper opener at his real spot, hope it's the end of Narine experiment for good.",18
"I find myself feeling good when Jadhav fails, the 2018 innings against MI left a along lasting mark.",10
Scenes when dhoni is told to fuck off from csk as well.,20
"CSK can do this, CSK can do that!

The honest truth is they don’t have quality to compete with the best teams in the tournament. They should try their best to avoid an embarrassment.",27
Naraine and Rus don't get anything. This is fucked up,8
"CSK fans = Jesse

CSK's playoff chances = Jane

Jadhav = Walter White",25
Dhoni should watch Cars 3,19
Suresh Raina and harbajan spotted dancing in the corner.,18
Wish we had little unbiased commentators/pundits to show some pair questioning Dhoni and his lack of form.,38
Dhoni plays Jadhav to make himself look good.,37
KKR would have lost this if opposition was any other team. Thanks CSK. Thala Academy rocks.,19
These commentators kept on bashing dk for not bowling sunil/finishing Cummings over but did they ever criticize dhoni for his ultra slow bating?!,28
Kkr wins in the  battle of teams witth most annoying fan bases.,10
Kedar Jadhav got robbed of MOTM #JusticeForKedar,28
"It's so unfair for CSK, KKR played with 13 players.",22
Csk fans should just stop shifting blame from one thing to another. Today Jadhav is the scapegoat. Up until this match the excuse was that the top not getting runs. Dhoni's batting has been very poor this season and also his captaining is questionable. Fans are quick to blame jadhav now but he had to come in because of dhoni. It was Dhoni's decision to sent him over bravo.,29
"More than anything, this season should serve as a reminder that either you consider: 

 - A) a captain is as good as his team and we should probably not give Dhoni exclusive credit for the trophies.

 - B) Or, Captain is responsible for everything , and therefore, also takes blame for shit performances.

There are too many people here who selectively believe A or B to keep the blame off Dhoni!",42
"So the fight is gonna be between RCb, csk and kkr for 3 and 4th spots. Srh and punjab for 7th. RR will be fighting for 5th",6
Long time CSK fan here. I'm so fucking disappointed amd angry. 4 losses in 6 games is just so sad.,24
"What a shit decision to send Kedhav Jadhav, a batsman who is shit in T20, who is in terrible form, who cannot strike the ball hard, who is literally the worst player in the league now, ahead of Bravo who is coming off a good batting performance and a full tournament match practice in the CPL. We deserved to lose this one.",32
Kedar Jadhav to Tewathia nahi Chewathia hai!,3
"Just saw a video on fb about rosogulla biryani. 
M FUCKING DONE.",3
KKR won the match so it means Karthik is now a genius captain.,18
"This IPL is so unpredictable, is the KXIP bowling really that bad that CSK can cruise through them but absolutely bottle it against KKR?",15
"Jadhav is big Salman Khan fan, what else to say.  
Salman can't act, still get paid.  
Jadhav can't bat, still get paid.",28

All other fanbases to Jadhav: * Careful he's a hero Spiderman Meme *,27
"If I was Rajni i n Arunachalam, I’m gonna spend that 30 crores on Jadhav",14
Wow csk really playing like rcb these days,31
Any bongs who might wanna share his feelings with3-4 paragraphs?,6
"If only MI would start losing games too.

Maybe we could get a DC vs RCB final!",21
"Jadhav has scored 58 off 59 till now in the tournament and he was sent in the 7th, 11th, 11th and 17th overs",30
Ultimate troll would if KKR fans make a Jadhav appreciation thread!,6
It wouldn’t have hurt this much if they had gotten all out,13
"Dhoni is like icing on the cake kinda of like Ozil for Arsenal in football context.

If the cake is not good enough, icing ain’t saving the day.",13
bruh i slept through the match but this loss hella funny they lost only by 10 runs with half lineup left :dogekek:,26
"Maybe off-topic, but he did play for KKR, is anyone else watching a Brett Lee interview on Aussie Fox?

EDIT: Never mind. It was a 2018 interview with Bob Craddock.",8
Can't believe we shithoused our way to 3rd in the table,36
"**Dhoni against Narine in IPL**  

Runs: 30 Balls: 63 SR: 47 in 13 innings with 5 dismissals. Not a single boundary off Narine. Reason why he went after Varun Chakraborty, because Narine got an over left.",37
Dream 11 Game Changer of the match. Kedar Jadhav 7(12) & MS Dhoni 11(12).,34
CSK Fans have some over-the-top reactions: Here's  [change.org](https://www.change.org/p/ms-dhoni-drop-kedar-jadhav-from-csk?recruiter=846182825&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&utm_term=psf_combo_share_initial&recruited_by_id=3ae8f810-efcd-11e7-943b-7905b2abe27b) petition to drop Kedar Jadhav from team. smh.,39
Ma boi Tripathi's innings going unacknowledged in this anger over CSK's botched chase. He's been warming the benches for almost a season. Good on him for grabbing this opportunity.,34
"CSK fans: we will jump to 3rd if we win today! 

Also CSK fans when I criticize their team: clearly this is your first time watching CSK matches.

Me: Anything else guys because all i see is a team destined to finish bottom 4 watching the games?",28
"Is Jadhav managed by Dhonis sports management company? I really don’t know why he keeps selecting him, unless his company is managing him.",30
"Rahul Tripathi - ""Performing in front of Shahrukh sir is very special, it's a dream come true.""",31
Jadhav sus,21
I'm in dire need of a csk support group to cope up with this shit,22
"Jadhav is getting serious abuses on his Insta profile, he limited his comments section now",38
Csk just ruining Ruturaj & Jagadeesan's career,32
"CSK fans: Watching Dhoni play can get very irritating sometimes.

Jadhav: Amateurs! 

CSK fans: What did you say, punk?

Jadhav: You fucking Amateurs! Watch me play today and see how it really feels.",33
"CSK fans acting like it's the end of the world. Common guys it just a game. Shit happen!

get your shit together. Get it all together. And put it in a backpack. All your shit. So it’s together.

and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know, take it to the shit store and sell it… Or put it in a shit museum, I don’t care what you do, you just gotta get it together.

 Get your shit together after all it's just a game.  ~ Shri kedar morty jadhav.",46
Atleast CSK didn't lose all the 10 wickets. It's a huge moral victory.,23
"All this build up for DC vs MI. 

Rabada + Nortje >> Pollard + Pandya. 

Its not DC’s fault that other teams are so mediocre.",6
WTF stopped watching at 10 overs. How did CSK lose this and fall 10 runs short?,39
Next CSK will take on RCB. Meme fest lol.,54
Dhoni is the Abhishek Dinda of Batting.,26
CSK fans must Thank jadeja for maintaining the NRR again 😂,19
**Warning(Explicit Content):** CSK fans in Kedar Jadhav's [Instagram](https://twitter.com/LoyalSachinFan/status/1313913246202556417?s=19) comment section. Feel bad for this guy now.,20
"Fun Fact: Jadhav is getting all the blame for yesterday's match, but deep down, even you know that Thala was equally responsible for his test knock.",4
"Only a 10-run defeat for CSK which will ensure their NRR remains in decent shape. But the same can't be said about their middle order. Until that fixes itself, they're in some trouble in this tournament. How good was that from Karthik though. Saving his mystery spinners to exploit the struggling middle-order. Anyway, that's it from us. It's a goodbye from Sagar Chawla on behalf of Vineet Anantharaman, Rishi Roy, Raju Peethala, Abhinand Raghavendran and Siva.",3
