His batting didn't really matter because sky and hardik, pollard did well in middle order. 

I always thought that Pollard with his antiques would be a terrible captain, but he showed us in cpl and few games for mi that he is very mature and can definitely lead a team. 

Another problem is ishan Kishan's position. He has always been meh at number 4 but this season he seemed in form and got even better when he started opening. He also opened for gujarat lions and gave them explosive starts.

Axar's impact is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of Nortje's balls will go over a typical batter's head. There's also Iyer's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Dash Player let me down, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these wins and losses, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Delhi truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Pant's existential catchphrase ""EASYEASYEASY"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Baz's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

Samson scored 3 50's and 375 runs with a strike rate of 159. He has Rohit Sharma level range of shots and timing when he is on song. He excelled better than Pant in every aspect this season. Ishan scored more runs and he can be considered purely as a batsman.

 I can't seriously believe it when people say when Pant is above pecking order than Samson for his talent. How much more hypocritical can guys get? Talent wise Samson is way above Pant. I don't even understand why the heck every one calls Pant a generational talent? He has a very limited range of shots and his offside game is weak. 

It's also seems that the opponents are already figured him out. Pant is asked to be responsible for his run of low scoring innings repeatedly.Generational talents don't keep making the same mistakes, they adapt and improve.  Pant doesn't adapt nor improve and that's not the fault of coaches of management. It's his own fault. He lacks cricketing intelligence.",9

One thing I would like to bring is how loyalty to some franchises might pay you in more than one way ...

With mumbai , if you are a MVP like rohit , bumrah , pandya etc. Ambanis take care of you  completely , even in off season ... Medical issue , fitness ..

They have become an all bases covered franchise with experience to manage professional sports.

There is always a after career opportunity with mumbai in some capacity.

Kkr is another such franchise...But  there is no comparison for money mumbai can bring to the table.

Now say you play for revolving door franchise like rr, kxip etc..

You never know how many seasons you would last.

Bailey has one great season soon he was gone...Ashwin came n gone ...Hope kxip stick with rahul.
Rr is also foreign management..

Question is if you are surya kumar yadav or nitish rana or tewatia ...Who is more confident about their role in team going into next season of ipl .

He carried the whole ICL team after Rayudu left. What sets him apart from other players is he absolutely demolishes the batting attack. There is no rhythm to his destruction, he dosent care about being stylish or tries to go out of his ways. He plays by his strengths and that's what's allowed him to play for so long. Another thing that I genuinely like about him is how he enjoys the game. It dosent matter if he wins or loses, he's always smiling, dancing and makes you realise at the end of it the sport is just about enjoying yourself and being in the moment, fuck catches or stumpings! I genuinely thought he was done for after he was axed by the Sidemen but he's still going strong. It's a shame he isnt playing in the 100.

2020-11-05T18:33:32+00:00,vedvineet98,Prithvi Shaw is an absolute abomination. His footwork is horrible and his feet go nowhere! How can he get out for a single digit score (if not a duck) in every match and still show his goddamn face in the next game. I don't understand why Ponting keeps backing him game after game even when he has shown no responsibility whatsoever.,42

2020-11-05T20:59:01+00:00,,"Is no one going to talk about how dependent MI's bowling is on Bumrah and Boult giving them early breakthroughs? In the last match against SRH they were not even able to take a single wicket, or no one was economical. In today's match too, no one was able to drag the momentum of 31 for 5 forward - I don't understand what Nathan Coulter Nile is doing, or what is his purpose on the team - neither economical, nor a wicket taking bowler. He was used as a strike bowler in the last match and it didn't go well.

So if a team decides to play out Bumrah and Boult overs carefully, they are in good shape for the next 10-12 overs. DC could have won today if they did that.",30
