2020-10-28T12:38:56+00:00,,Feel nervous about this match as an RCB fan. I’m not happy with how RCB has been batting. Paddikal started the season brightly but then regressed to playing defensive cricket even in the powerpla. Finch just throws his wicket away and looks uncomfortable to any and all bowlers. Kohli doesn’t try piercing the gaps for boundaries and just rotates strike. Gurkeerat is unproven and doesn’t look like a player who can strike big. On top of all this Saini is likely injured so we’ll have lord Umesh and lord Siraj most probably,56

The balance of the team required Philippe to keep wickets in order to manage ABD's fitness through the tournament. This is how RCB intended to be structured when the IPL started, but their backup WK has been keeping for a major part of the tournament already. 

What has happened now is that ABD could potentially be getting a little too fatigued out at the business end of the tournament, requiring protective strategies (which RCB have already shown their are prone to do) and Philippe has been underexposed, which could be a problem if this is the structure RCB want to have towards this part of the IPL. Phillippe is batting well now, and thank god for that. RCB need in-form openers for the playoffs, no doubt.

Also, not like Finch made the difference between winning and losing in any of the games so far. RCB have scored a lot of points, so it looks like it's worked so far, but they've definitely paid a ""soft"" price for this.",10

Also AB did what he does so often. Get ahead of himself and let the lower order hanging. He knew Kohli was out. Him and Padikkal were the last known batsmen left. So many overs to go. He has a poor record to Pollard. He could have just played it out. We all know how he can capitalize. His dismissal angered me so much. He did the same thing when RCB were in the final against SRH.

He has a shot for every ball, an answer for everything that is thrown at him.He plays shots all around the ground. He genuinely doesn't looks like a bowler will be able to get him out when he's on song. He plays the field like a magician and has the ability to hit any gap you provide him with on the field. A true 360° player. And the determination he showed today was testament to how much he would be hurting inside. What more he has to do?",33

People except VK to behave like Sachin/Dravid but he is a different kind of personality. Remember people lost their shit when Dhoni was caught saying bsdk idhar daikh le?

Koach's bowlers were getting their asses handed to them so he tried the next best thing, getting into the batsman's mind. Good on SKY for coming out as the winner here but this was a high stakes game and people are acting as if Koach has never done this before. He's done the stare down and walking up thing millions of times. Pollard can sledge Virat as much as Virat can sledge SKY as much as Hardik can sledge Morris. 

""Stature"" doesn't matter when you're in the field. This is also why it's annoying to hear people whine about players cursing, like when Rohit said BC a couple of games ago and insta was all like Virat se seekha hai (learnt it from Virat)

That being said, I loved the reply SKY gave but it's annoying to hear how Virat should've kissed his feet or even go easy on him due to the Australia thing. Not like Virat didn't first bump SKY or something, that would've been an indication of something deeper than on field banter.",23

Like I mean yea he didn't specifically say Surya played well during Presentation but he isn't obliged to do so, stop crying over it.

As much as you want to believe Virat conspired with selectors to keep Surya out, no that didn't happen. Selectors have fucked up earlier as well in selecting wrong players. 
FWIW, Ravi Shastri on Twitter praised Surya right after the match but according to r/Cricket he is Kohli's man so why would he ask
 for Surya's inclusion ?

As far as the on field things are concerned, it didn't even escalate to anything. Just a bit of stares and Koach  pressurising him in a tight contest. I mean worst things have happened on field and this wasn't it. All in the game.

Remember peeps, IPL will be over in another 2 weeks ;)
