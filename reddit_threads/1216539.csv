"Lord Umesh might play today, because Saini is injured.",3
"Must win game for both, gonna be a great match!

MI are more settled and balanced.
RCB need to up their middle over game, maybe promote Moeen to up the RR.",3
Bruh. I am so depressed jesus christ. MI losing this match doesn't even make sad even though I am a MI fan,1
Qualifying for the finals is a lot like the eating of an Orange,2

"Moeen should open, imo, also, 8 overs of off-spin would be handy against MIs 4 lefties.

Instead of bringing back Umesh, Udana and Dube can replace Finch and Saini, that'll still leave us with 7 bowling options.",7
Go Mumbai. Please let us qualify for the playoffs. Plis,6
"Yesterday DC did a favor by losing so badly that RCB are back in top 2. 

It'd be totally in character if Good Guys^^TM RCB show up and send DC back to top 2.",25
Is there any psychologist or a therapist here??,6
One team qualifies for certain today doesn't it?,8
Feel nervous about this match as an RCB fan. I’m not happy with how RCB has been batting. Paddikal started the season brightly but then regressed to playing defensive cricket even in the powerpla. Finch just throws his wicket away and looks uncomfortable to any and all bowlers. Kohli doesn’t try piercing the gaps for boundaries and just rotates strike. Gurkeerat is unproven and doesn’t look like a player who can strike big. On top of all this Saini is likely injured so we’ll have lord Umesh and lord Siraj most probably,53
All I want is a good contest. Enough with the collapses. Give me a fight.,9
"How did Dube make it to the Indian team, feels like there are way more talent in the Indian side.",12
"Feel like phillipe should've been given a long rope instead of Finch, given Finch's ipl record. And of course him keeping is a massive bonus",8

Kohli should bid goodbye to his middle over tuk tuk.,23

"Ima say this again. SRH is capable of beating RCB and MI is capable of beating DC. If MI wins today and the previous matchups happen the way i said it would, one of RCB or DC could finish 5th with 14 points since RCB and DC play each other. Call me a deluded KKR fan but if KKR and KXIP can win their remaining 2 games, there is a good chance they can both make it.",1
"One for the football fans here -

Last week, MI vs CSK was followed by Barca vs Real, the greatest team vs team rivalry

Today, soon after the Rohit vs Kohli game, Messi vs Ronaldo game is gonna happen, the greatest player vs player rivalry. Turns out Rohit is injured, so is Ronaldo",17
Theory: MI are cock-blocking Surya Kumar from getting into national team so that they can have him under the valuable uncapped quota,15
What is a good score on this pitch? Considering 196 was so easily chased by RR,5

Josh Phillipe reminds me of Steve Smith fsr,3
Aside from Philippe's trigger movement the more yall see him the more Ponting you will get than Smudge. Plays through the covers more and plays the pull shot a lot more. Not that good though haha,6
we are going to lose today. MI never lose two games in a row,6
How good is Josh Philippe on a scale of 1-10?,3
Omg so beautiful,7
Good one again,5
Pollard with his brain dead captaincy. Make qdk the captain.,4
No MI dont loose to rcb,4

I know that was a misfield but it was a really good shot,2

"So, who's coming to bowl next? They had a new bowler every over so far",8
"Dear RCB, please either lose or win by a giant margin. Thanks.",11
Padikkal is one of those guys selectors could be looking forward to in future seasons imo. He plays some really classy shots.,4
"Aaron Finch was Hosh.

This is Josh.",31
he looks like smith and plays like smith.,4
How old are these two?,1
"OK Harsha we get it!
Stop jizzing over SRH !!",6
After this match the points table will be a mirror image from top to bottom,4
Haha. He took pitch catch with 2 hands. Idiot,4
"RCB may have made a mistake underplaying Philippe. Hear me out, I am an RCB fan as well.

The balance of the team required Philippe to keep wickets in order to manage ABD's fitness through the tournament. This is how RCB intended to be structured when the IPL started, but their backup WK has been keeping for a major part of the tournament already. 

What has happened now is that ABD could potentially be getting a little too fatigued out at the business end of the tournament, requiring protective strategies (which RCB have already shown their are prone to do) and Philippe has been underexposed, which could be a problem if this is the structure RCB want to have towards this part of the IPL. Phillippe is batting well now, and thank god for that. RCB need in-form openers for the playoffs, no doubt.

Also, not like Finch made the difference between winning and losing in any of the games so far. RCB have scored a lot of points, so it looks like it's worked so far, but they've definitely paid a ""soft"" price for this.",12
Why do people hate Finch. He gave some amazing starts to RCB. He took Archer on for a huge 2 sixes as well.,4
Script writer frantically making notes of what Harsha is saying!,10
They need to start converting these dots onto singles,4
Hopefully Rohit will recover soon and be a part of the India vs Aus series,3
Pandya looks like a kingpin lmao,3
"I might be wrong, but has anyone else noticed that these days Bumrah is not able to nail the Yorkers like he used to earlier?? Most of his attempted Yorkers are coming of as low full tosses.

While his numbers are impeccable this IPL, but as a huge Bumrah fan I feel a little worried. Shami seems to be doing a better job with the Yorkers these days.",5
This game looks set up for a 200+ run chase where MI top order collapses and requires a mammoth innings from Pollard to take them over the line. One can only hope,5
Somebody gonna have to do a madness to account for the 50(15) from Hardik.,4
Missed Boult's over. Was it swinging?,1
next over by pollard then hardik,1
4 overs 4 different bowlers. Pollard to bowl now.,2
Boult needs to bowl in PP. Wicketless PP doesn't fill me with confidence.,1
Hardik Pandya seems to be one salt tax away from doing a Dandi March from Abu Dhabi to Sharjah,3
"Just started watching the game, can someone please explain the logic behind RCB’s changes today?",2
Pandya was so impressed by Monu Kumar's look that he copied it !,6
"Koach is so intense, he'd probably be wearing that helmet if he was watching from home too.",10
Pls no Anjum today,2
Did Josh played in bigbash,4
Nice start for RCB and for Josh 🥰,3
"After yesterday's batting display by SRH, this feels pedestrian. Not critiquing, but what a display by Warner and Saha.

Edit: downvotes!!! For what? Just cause I thought SRH batted well and enjoyed it. Some redditors need to get a life or maybe some comprehension lessons.",-2
Even if rcb score 200 these mi fuckers easily score 20runs per over in the death overs,14
Hardik Pandya - Diwar potne wala lag raha hai,6

Everyone was talking about Finch being a big match player. Josh tho scored a match winning 50 last BBL for the Sixers in the final!,5

Joshy😍,7
Already scored more than Finch's average,8

Oh damn! That shot was straighter than a conservative.,7
"Kohli sitting with all the gear on if someone gets runout, he'll personally complete the run",10

"Having siraj, steyn and dube as your 4th and 5th bowling option is fucking redundant. Have udana in between for fuck sakes",3

"Alright, Friendship ended with Finch

Josh is my new best friend",7

QDK has been awesome with the gloves except when Bumrah bowls ofc.,9
QDK is a great keeper.,2
Taken quinny,1
Gayle is 2 years younger than these two openers combined,4
I'm now more and more confident that Finch was playing like shit on purpose to sabotage Koach before the Aus Series,5

Pollard is going to bowl himself now isn't it.,2
MI missing Rohit or No,3
Rr broke MI. You love to see it,2
Phillipe has already done better than Finch’s regular innings of 17(10),3
"Mumbai are struggling of late because both Pattinson and Boult over-performed in the first half. 

Both of them have always been average T20 bowlers in their careers. They've now fizzled out and so all of a sudden, Mumbai look so non threatening minus Bumrah.",3

Bumrah scares the ball lol,6
Swann opens his innings all grumpy like an old man 😁,3
The real test for RCB begins after these 4 balls. They lose moment ij the middle overs many a times,6

they've pronounced Philippe every way except the right way haha. Ends in Pee,11
Young man in their early 20s destroying world best bowlers.,16
VK want to fuck with pollards brain today,13
Pls fuck up Mumbai today,6
sexy chris gaffaney,3
How garbage is pattinson,-4
Ez 180,1
He's gotten out also by trying to play this shot,1
"RCB played phillipe initially but played him in the middle order. 

He didnt perform  well so dropped him.  


Today made him open (his natural position) he played well

suprised face.",20
We're fucked. Hugely fucked if we don't pick atleast 3 before 10 overs.,3
"54 off 6, great start.

Ngl was scared with 2 youngsters vs Bumrah Boult Patty but we're out unscathed.

Need to see how they manoeuvre now with 5 outside the circle.",14
Dafuq Bumrah everywhere,15
Padi and Phili are showing INTENT! Sunny will be proud.,6
Mi gonna lose so bad . Survive the pp agaisnt mi and u can easily get 200+,4
My heart goes 💗❣💗💞💝💗💞❣💗💝💞💖👀,11
"Kohli & AB have no idea how to play when their team is not 15/2, they gonna panik and get out, great strat from MI",29
"How old is Smith?, he has his son already playing in the IPL.",22
This is easily our best PP of the season,9
Par score anyone??,1
"Lmao 

Schrödinger Philippe",2
"If DDP scores more than 30runs, we’re gonna win this",9
Padikkal is the emerging player of IPL this year. No debate about it!,9
Steve Smith second copy first being Marnus.,-1
Philippe looks younger than me and im 17,16
Zaheer and Rohit look chill af,1
Scenes in r/cricket if kohli does tuk tuk in this wicket after this start,2
"ABD will smack us around, we will lose by a huge margin",7
*Sad Finch Noises*,9
Pattinson resembles Ben Affleck so much,6
Are the timeouts any help? I mean surely the players are qualified enough to read the situation and play accordingly,2
Pandya looks like Shakal today.,7
Who is doing these haircuts for MI bc oof,11
How many Smith clones?,14
"JOSHUA PHILLIPE HAS ARRIVED, LESSS GOOOO!!",18
Our worst phase starts now,11
"RCB at the top, CSK at bottom is so 2020",3
Dont do this MI 😔,2
this ground is cursed for Mumbai,1
ACB should share their Smith cloning technology with all of us.,3
Josh is what smith dreamed to be,3
Man hardick was such a handy bowler. Miss his bowling.,5
Phillipe and smith started their ipl careers with rcb. Coincidence?,7
ABD has taken Josh Philippe under his wings something gonna rub on him.,10
"With all these Smith clones, Deveruex evil incorporated?",2
Is Rohit playing today?,0
Devdutt needs to be groomed for tests. Bring back elegance to batting.,3
Josh would have gotten orange cap if Virat had played him before. He got scared,-3
Philliphi looks more Steve Smith than steve smith.,9
Looks like that NRR is in danger tonight lmao,3
This powerplay doesn’t bode well for us.,1
Anyone knows which year was r/cricket established?And which was the first match thread?,9
"Damn these two youngsters actually handled well in the pp against bumrah,Boult, Pattinson and Yorker king krunal",7
cant watch this mauling. see you on saturday!,-4
Steve smith played for rcb?,2
Will be interesting to see how Kohli fucks up this start by looking exclusively for 1s and 2s until the 15th over.,5
"Cork: Philip-ey

Lee: Philip-pee",5
19 Bananas 🍌 a day FFS. Siddle is unreal.,4
Did I hear that Siddle used to eat 19 Bananas every day?,4
"Really MI.. we're letting some Steve Smith wannabe score against?! 

Unleash the spinners please.",4
🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 a day 😳,3
Padikkal has been the only youngster who has consistently played like he belongs,10
Paddikal will fuck Krunal,3
Saurabh Tiwary looks like he ate the 12th man and all the bananas,7
In b4 DDP throws his wicket away because he doesn't want to bat with Virat,2
We're saving chahar for ABD it seems. But the way we've been bowling ABD might not get to bat today.,3
We're fucked.,2
Man for some reason I just Hate Krunal Pandya,14
"Joshua has that ""Imma bang your girl rest face""",2
Fuck Tiwary really saved that,10
That's a solid start by the double Ps. RCB should be disappointed if they don't score 180+,4
Who is that thiccc fielder?,8
"Like how DDP is playing this match, playing more aggressively is just what is needed in PP",5
Tiwary should get a samosa pav for that fielding effort,8
That's the most Tiwary has run since the lockdown.,9
Well tried inzi,6
Tiwari must have lost at least 2kgs after that jog,10
Great powerplay for RCB. Not many bad balls by MI either. Exactly how Stokes and co. played against them. Hope they don't slow down now.,3
My mother thought it was Rohit Sharma running,4
Is Phillipe being picked in the Australia squad against India?,1
Tiwary tired for rest of the innings....,9
Saurabh Tiwari tumse na hopayega,5
I have an inkling that Gayle might be faster than Tiwary.,3
Who called him samosa pav?? Nikal laude,7
Samosa pav with the spice.,4
Pls don't slow down in middle overs now,8
Chonky Boi Tiwary,5
"Josh was the motm in bbl final, the only stat that should matter to the rcb fans.",12
Rohit would have been proud,13
MI will gift Philippe 5 runs just for making Tiwary run that much lol,8
start ddp strike rate watch,8
"Jeez RCB, atleast use a lube /s",3
That was his top speed?,4
Wow! Zero wicket in Powerplay,6
"""The Steve Smith experiment has worked fantastically, we must now mass produce and capitalize on it ""- Australia, circa early 21st century",32
Can someone send me the link to when Harsha said Kohli know the target when batting or something like that?,1
Yeah we are fucked,7
[deleted],9
Wonder how long we'll have to wait before we get a Rohit SLAMS Kohli article on Cricinfo lmao,4
So happy to see Philippe play after they dropped him only after two matches,3
I remember Gilchrist really was pushing for Philippe to play in the series in England. And for most of it he was right until Carey came good and played a match winning innings. You can see why he likes him.,8
DDP 30 reached! We gonna win this bois,6
"Padikkal please don't slow down. 🥺

You've done great in the PP.",9
"As an MI fan, I've a bad feeling that Phillipe and ABD are gonna tear us a new one today

Their bowling is kinda weak, hopefully we can pull through",3
Cloning technology in Australia has gone real far huh!,18
MI missing Finch today.,9
DDP SR watch: 167,5
"Padikkal scored 30 , rcb win confirmed",7
"Danny you can call us the Double D's again, we are playing like that only.",8
Someone's gotta fuck Krunal up,4
So Koach shuffles between helmet and cap even when sitting in dugout?,9
PredictViz says RCB will get *175* runs after 20 overs.,3
"Three times this has happened now, natural opener players replacing somewhat out of form legendary openers.

Ruturaj, with Watson out.
Saha, with Bairstow out.
Philippe, with Finch out.",11
[deleted],10
Why are pandya brothers wannabe cerabians?,12
I bet even RCB management didnt expect this good start,24
DDP SR watch: 155,4
Would like to see them a bit more aggressive running 2s.,4
Daily Reminder: Pollard is younger than Rohit,8
Danny loves finding Double isn't?,4
Long long ago when Saurabh Tiwary was [budget Dhoni.](https://superstarsbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Saurabh-Tiwary-facts.jpg),6
"Guys relax, rcb will slow down the game between the 10 to 15 overs and then struggle to score in the last 5 overs against Bumrah and boult",5
"Hate it when bowlers yell ""catch it"" and the ball is no where near the fielder. Gives me anxiety!",9
[What the ball saw when Tiwary approached him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlplCs00wTE),10
It is great to see 2 youngsters stepping up and playing well regardless of the result today,9
"Foreign keepers be like : aaah oooh
Indian keepers be like:- ayyo uiyyo",9
[Skip to 1:45 to see what Josh was trying to do there](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ytLCWYLv4z0),7
The Smith gene-pool must be strong indeed if his 15 year old son is already playing for RCB. Bet he's extremely proud. Also jealous.,12
"If we are going on form, why do people like gill and Shaw get picked for white ball cricket but not DDP? He has been better than both this season and the other two players don’t have much reputation to go off of either",3
Bring on Chahar!!,-2
"Mumbai are like RCB without Rohit, they're lacking a captain",3
Josh looks like a young homelander !!!,6
Replace finchy with baby smith in Ind-Aus series ಠ﹏ಠ,3
Make QDK the captain.,1
"Koach, pls capitalise on atleast one good start this season...",5
Loving the MI fans' meltdown.,4
"If Dominic Cork starts speculating about Rohit, BCCI will have him on the next plane back to London tonight.. that's what his fellow dugouters were trying to warn him right now LOL",4
Nice to see the trend of lower ranked team dominating the opponent is continuing.,4
The amount of poise and confidence in these youngins is really impressive,8
"Just noticed, Krunal didn't make the t20 side. Koach is definitely showing RCB bias. /s",5
"Philippe looks like he should be getting out Lbw easily. Just like I used to think when Smith was a new player.
I was so wrong.",8
Brett lee still looks fit af,3
" MI has taken the most wickets in Powerplay this IPL - 22  
The only two matches they failed to pick a wicket in this phase was both against RCB - 59/0 in Dubai (28 Sep) and 54/0 in Abu Dhabi today.

Source: Cricbuzz",4
I just want the repetition of yesterday match,4
“gyaaaaohhhh!”,4
Can't wait for AB to take Bumrah and Boult to cleaners at the death similar against prime Steyn,4
"Dont worry Mi fans, Koach will Himself Drag the RR to 8 runs per over by his HUGE MUSCLES",5
"For some reason, i fucking hate when Chahar bowls so much",6
Morrison is calling Paddikal and Phillipe double P's. We know deep down he wanted real PP (Parthiv Patel) out there.,9
360 padikkal,9
chahar that was nowhere near a catch,5
is that eoin morgan?,10
how is he getting bat on those every go?! Insane,5
"If I ever coach a team, I'll make sure I'll select openers that chew gum when batting. Those are the openers who do real damage",12
Looks like 200 is back on the menu boys!,7
"RCB fans: \*Panic\* \*What's happening\*

RCB Fans: Relax bros, we will slow down soon.",10
Eoin Morgan and Steven Smith,6
Guddu pandit got cardio,2
"Hardik Pandya not bowling is really fucking up the balance for MI 
 
Would love to see Anukul Roy play in place of KPandya but that's probably not gonna happen",8
Padikkal looks so assured!,5
Paddikal has been taking notes from Mr.360 clearly,9
WTF was that shot Padikkal? I SUBSCRIBE!,7
"RCB are REALLY going to struggle in the death bowling department without Saini, against Pollard and Hardik. Siraj and Steyn very much opening bowlers.",2
"He scored a few 50s, but imo this is DDP's most fluent innings.",7
"Holy shit, these are not rcb players",7
Both of these guys is amazing.,8
Philippe seems very active,6
Great shot!,7
JOSHYYY,8
DONT STOP,10
DDP has to put on a big one here,6
such fun watching the youngsters bat,12
Why is Big Aaron not playing?,8
OOOH BEN STOKES BC,2
Why is Qdk going Aiyoooo like a South Indian.,10
Damn Padikkal has the touch of a gentle lover,4
"Damn, whatta shot!",4
That footwork tho!!,3
"Team SKY assemble here, I have always said he should be captain in Rohits absence",2
That was a cracking inside-out shot by Phillipe against Chahar!,5
[deleted],8
"New RCB fans: ""Yay""
Old RCB Fans: ""This is nothing. Wait for MI to bat""",10
Lol De cock,6
Thank fuck they dropped Finch.,4
Why do I feel AB will come at 17.5 overs,3
I think I found the imposter guys. IT'S THE WHOLE FUCKING TEAM,4
We're in deep trouble,1
Good josh. Nice josh,3
Young blood yaaaah,3
"India's only pacey all rounders are: hardick,dubeyji and 3D. Not much backup",2
Are they saving Bumrah for Kohli and De Villiers who don't mind pace?,3
Fuck this match. Aim for the moon by Pop smoke is a banger,2
"Hopefully kohli can play naturally today, with this start :P",1
Two kids fucking with mighty MI so far,5
Finch ain't coming back.,2
That's out,1
DDP: Im gonna sweep this man's career away,3
nice ballerina pose!,1
"Chahar slowing it down after being spanked. Brave. 

And gets a Wicket!! Woohoo!",5
Why is Steve Smith playing for RCB?,6
"Oh well

Job fucking done buddy",5
invincible QDK,6
Great work by quinny,9
I wont get hyped until we win this match,9
Pain phillipe,3
That's out? Qdk u beauty,4
GONE,0
Dhoni 2.0,3
Ooh gone,4
"Fuck this shit,  

somehow bring in Koach, need those 7-8 run overs",3
Unlucky,6
HOLY SHIT THAT’S OUT,5
The amount of abuses Kohli gets would probably reduce by 50% if they don't play an ad featuring Kohli right after a poor performance by him.,5
"Alright I know it's overstating the obvious, but how fucking good is Padikkal for a 20 yo",21
Koach time bitches,6
Ffs,5
soo much talent and he was sitting in the dug out for finch,8
Rcb is the only team that has managed to put pressure on the MI spinners and force them to bowl pollard or someone else.,9
"Looked out to me, foot in air",5
RCB have never beaten MI twice in a season. This could be the year,4
All RCB need is a good Indian wicket keeper batsman(We had KL) and a good death bowler.,10
Unlucky,7
Aww I feel bad,8
Time for standard 43(35) Koach knock.,9
Well played young one. Keep your head high!!,12
"Is the rubber on the tip not touching the ground ?

Great stumping still by Qdk",4
That's brilliant from QDK and Chahar,3
Nooo...,3
"Damn QdK, excellent stumping.",9
"Well, shit.",4
Damn it looked like a casual appeal,13
"**7.5** Chahar to Philippe, OUT,  **71-1**

JR Philippe st &dagger;de Kock b Chahar 33 (24b 4x4 1x6) SR: 137.50",4
Virat Kohli ready for his odi innings,10
So unlucky but he did great!,13
FUCK YOU CHAHAR,9
Hope RCB keeps up this scoring rate in the middle overs ;-;,2
Bad luck. Wanted to see more,3
Koach needs to maintain momentum,2
so much better than finch though,6
QDK didn't think he had him,6
oMg pHiLiPPe iS bEtTeR tHAn sMiTh lMAo,0
"In comes Kohli's 1s, 2s and the rare 4s and 6s.",6
YASSS BOYY!!,1
Good innings this. Definitely better than what Finch would've achieved.,3
Incredibly lame way to lose your wicket,3
"Peace Peace, I am not angry.",5
T20 ends. Test match starts. Collapse incoming.,5
QDK the new thala,3
Ok koach give us those 6-7 runs per over,2
dont get too cocky you bastards. If our batsman hit you can be damned sure our bowling will fail,6
Philippe had good luck with the bowled and bad luck with the stumped,3
Josh did a pretty good job should be kept for the remaining games. Looked much more comfortable than Finch did and scored well too,2
Koach to play tuk tuk innings,4
Well done Joshi sir!,3
F,1
Phillipe has done his job. But now the real danger will start for MI,2
"Poor Phillipe, he did what Finch was supposed to do",5
Well played lad,2
"Any guesses why players like Dawid Malan, Martin Guptil, Mitchel Starc etc aren't in IPL? Did they go unsold?",2
That's just unlucky,3
"what a weird soft dismissal, wanted to see this kid take it deep",6
"Such a nonchalent reaction from QDK. No one looked excited lol

Great stuff!!",4
"FFS Kohli, nothing of that tuk tuk bullshit. Today is not the day.",3
Did his job but that was sheer brilliance from DeKock,3
"Rabada got smacked, archer got smacked, Nortje got smacked, bumrah got smacked, Boult got smacked and Pattinson got smacked in the last 3 matches. Time to watch Chahal and Washington get smacked next innings and it'll be fucking gold",2
"Idk guys, that was pretty quick. 3rd Ump kinda sus",7
"Deja vu from yesterday, win the toss choose to bowl first can't take wicket, openers doing there job perfectly, one of the opener coming from long gap.",3
"Erm, wasn't his foot down there?",3
Inb4 kohli 54(45) and ABD doesnt bat,7
Neither team thought it was actually out,6
You've just been De Kocked.,11
Send ABD now and let the carnage begin.,3
"There you go,my rajasthani boi♥️",0
"Holy fuck, didn't think that was out as De Kock appealed half-heartedly and  late",8
Inb4 kohli tires padikkal out by running and rr drops,10
Phillipe played well,4
Bummer. Good innings though. Cant imagine we switch back to Finch.,7
Raised that foot at the last moment bit unlucky for Josh.,5
That’s dhoni style stumping,3
That's unfortunate. Was really enjoying seeing this kid bat.,7
Finally something!,0
Already twice the player Finchy is,9
Would've liked to see more Phillipe,9
wtf is up with the disrispek to Kohli in this thread lmao,10
they making pattinson run lol,2
GG Phillipe did more in this match than Finch did all tournament..,13
Kohli already with 200sr,6
"Why do I feel this decision is bizarre? 🤔

Initially it looked as if it was in the air.. but it was actually on the ground itself . 


Maybe there's something wrong with my eyes only. O.o",5
Quinton singh De Dhoni,15
Mi playing with 4 Caribbeans. Unfair.,14
Only thing for Kohli to do now is to keep this momentum going and not get out. How hard can it be?!,1
Koach has to take a leaf out of Warner's book and be more aggressive,1
Is Sam Billings a Smith clone? /s,2
Why does ishan kishan looks like ravi kishan?,3
Can't wait to see quick 1s&2s masterclass from Koach,5
Tuk tuk Kholi has arrived,4
Abey Amit bsdk gaand me ghusa apna Expo 2020,7
[removed],4
"Koach with 200sr, fuck off r/cricket",6
DDP is now grinning about running 2 runs with Kohli...,6
Koach will tire out Paddikkal with his running and will kill the momentum,4
I really really hope kohli doesn’t slow the run rate down today,6
kohli will now prepare for the australia test series. Expecting rcb to be 100 in the 13th over,2
Koach without helmet. MI is doomed.,3
Not bad from philipppe,3
Even in dugout koach switches to cap when a spinner is bowling and goes back to helmet when a pacer comes xD,5
Josh has certainly earned his spot in the team no? Sorry Finchie,3
"I love cred ads, anyone else :D",4
"I would keep qdk just for his keeping, based on how many runs he has saved",2
Kohli should look to be aggressive from the start put more pressure on MI bowlers l.,1
Lmao people will literally shit on absolutely anyone for a couple of bad innings. Fucking 12 yo's,2
I want kohli to have minimum 133 sr today,2
"QdK is extremely underrated as a WK, and I mean peak dhoni level of performance for a consistently long period of time.",5
Why does ball go to Pattinson so many times,1
Wasn't he inside crease and touching ground???,4
He was looking so good wanted to see more of Philippe,1
Frick koach all my homies love poach,1
"I just wanted Josh to get a half century in his return, im so sad",3
"Less go Mumbai 

Final time I'll be rooting for you",1
Padikkal is only 20 😶,3
"Kohli tuk tuk is contagious, now Padikkal will tuk tuk too",0
Koach should wear a helmet. That throw Shankar copped the other night was nasty.,10
"Philippe looked really good today, frustating way to get good.",3
MI bowling is falling apart,1
Josh's innings more graceful than any innings Finch has played this season.,4
"As a keeper himself, Philippe will have to admire that bit of work. After  he gets over the disappointment of course.",10
Out of topic but do you guys think cyberpunk will come out before the vaccine,7
Man I love Kohli as much as the next guy but I'm begging him to score faster today rather than just run faster,14
"Padikkal crossed 30

See ya MI",11
hope DDP maintains his form and doesn't depend on koach for runs,11
Seems like Finch and Bairstow would be released next season.,5
Ok MI fess up who's the one we just heard on the stump mic yelling AIIIYYYOOOOOO,3
Nice tuned-in in time to see koach,6
"LMAO Govinda with that fucked up hairline. 

A painted over line would look better.",3
Rahul Chahar looks like Virgil van Dijk's son.,8
Lulli will struggle today,-3
Van dijk bowling well,4
Pls Kohli don’t slow down the pace and turn it into an odi,4
Guess which team Finch will play next season,3
Kohli trying had to kill the momentum.,6
Wtf koach,2
"I remember when Kohli used to sign the match ball , he never even looked at the mope who he was signing the ball for LOL",1
[deleted],0
DDP should just go for it before Koach exhausts him out with his 1's and 2's..,5
Don't tuktuk that much. Need a big score to win against Mumbai,7
Koach looks nervous,1
"Come on Koach, Focus!",1
"Phillipe : getsout

Padikkal : *nervously massages his legs*",9
"If they dont get atleast 185+, im gonna get so mad",8
[removed],3
Funny how Koach was wearing his helmet while sitting in the stands but now comes with his cap on.,7
"The only RCB player, management or fan; who was sad to see Phillipe perform tonight was Finch.",14
"can't wait for 6yrs time when our entire Aus line-up is just 7 fidgety, lights saber leaving, giant trigger movement, run scoring weird cunts",11
Kolhi practicing for the odi/test games in the tour,8
kohli slowing down the momentum,1
Kohli looking very shaky,0
"Kohli's in bois, get ready for a flood of 1s and 2s and a drought of 4s and 6s",7
Kohli walks in at 3. Bhaag milka Bhag playing in ddps head,13
Hope Kohli takes inspiration from Warner and play his natural attacking game instead of wannabe anchor.,7
"Although Mi is filled with match-winners, they buckle under pressure. Koach should start attacking and wait for Polly to start his shite strategy",9
Krunal 'Economical' 'Comeback' Pandya,3
Muthoot Finance sounds like a company that funds masterbation.,5
Even Koach can improve Krunal's figures,1
"Just want to point out that Josh has played a fluid 33 here, the only times Finch went past 25 this season were when he was dropped 2-4 times",9
Koach generally tries to hit a boundary every over even in ODI and that's why I don't understand why he is playing like this season :(,9
"A decent left hand Indian batsman exists...

Entire r/cricket: Is this next Yuvi?",11
"No, Rohitians vs Viratians today. sed life",2
DDP disappointed with Koach,4
"Bhogle is a horrible commentator,atleast in the ipl",2
"Kohli has  dube and Gurkeerat in the middle order  today, hoping he don’t do his safe odi batting",5
[deleted],17
Thank god lord umess isn't playing,5
I want paddy to go big today. Looked in great touch.,3
First <5 run over this match,3
He looks out of touch today. Trying too hard.,5
"Yeah, I dont really hate Kohli but fuck your tuktuk",9
"Mike Hesson feels RCB has been 10-12 runs short in the middle overs in the previous matches. 


Didn't know 30-40 runs = 10-12 runs for Mike Hesson.",11
"How do people still claim Kohli is a great T20 bat

17 fkn crores for this guy",7
"Kohli ,please do not play your classic odi inning here.",5
"Koach went outside edge, inside edge, leading edge in his first three balls. The Pant Special",52
Padikkal needs to keep hitting boundaries until Koach is set.,13
Padikkal gonna make up for Kohli’s slow batting,2
"*Kohli comes out to bat*

r/cricket: he slow",5
Glad that padikkal is playing with a higher SR today.,6
"*kohli enters
Le ddp- i need new shoes",3
Kohli should open. He needs time to get going,5
"Dev “fine I’ll do it myself, koach” Padikkal",7
"""Virat wants to play that way, expansively""

I don't believe you.",5
r/cricket is too critical of Koach,8
If mumbai wins I will order pav bhaji for dinner. If rcb wins I will order masala dosa for dinner!,3
"Y’all need to chill with the kohli slowing the game down talk. Liek he played 5 balls

Some of y’all really expect him to hit a boundary every ball I swear",7
See Rohit's happiness when he got Kohli out. RIFT^^TM confirmed,2
Paddikal has finally given on koach approach hes gonna attack.,4
Padikkal for emerging player.,7
Incoming Kohli run rate critics don't realize Kohli always plays like this for a few overs before accelerating. That's why he has been so consistent.,5
Koach still looks like he's in anchor mode. Hope he can accelerate towards the end,3
"Everyone asking kya plan hai and Chahal showing his phone, looks like he set for tonight.",2
"Padikkal, what the fuck man, you have that shot in your armory? JF Christ",5
Koach should watch and learn from the young bloke.,3
"Padikkal with boundaries, koach with 1 and 2s. Perfect.",6
There’s no question that the pitches have slowed up. As soon as I saw Stoinis bowl well yesterday I knew SRH would win the game because they have an attack of slower bowlers. Looks like bowling slow is paying off in today’s game too.,5
"Hodeero bolimakla

T: Keep slogging, sons of mothers with shaved heads",5
Paddikal showing VK how to play spin,3
"Guys , have Australia announced the squad for India test series yet? If not, when?",1
I suspect Philippe won't get a match for Aus soon unless these simultaneous NZ T20's and SA tests end up happening.,2
"Do Not Criticize Koach.......

he is just making Australian Odi and test Bowlers pee in their pants",11
r/cricket well underway into getting a 70+ innings for Koach,3
Padikkal showing Koach that the pitch isn't slow this time.,11
SLOW KOACH EXPRESS.,5
Kohli and DVP seeing off Krunal like he's Rashid Khan smh,5
Padikkal blessing my eyes today,11
PADDIKAL YOU BEAUTY,8
Padikkal’s timing is something else.,9
Bumrah :((,4

"A promising start from Phillipe, and hopefully he’ll be persisted with up top, especially with his ability to keep wickets and give ABD a rest. Him and DDP are wonderful to watch up top.",16
Koach had that amazing 2016 season because he opened,3
Which team has the worse RR at death ?,4
"Now that I actually think about it our T20 side has 3 Anchors in our Top 4, cause for concern surely.",4
DDP BC,3
Was Padikkal selected for India?,3
Comms trying to cover up the slow batting style of Koach,5
[deleted],9
All the runs without a single rash shot!,7
DDP doing bits today,3
Hope CSK poach Paddikal next mega auction,-3
Padikkal shaming VKs ones and twos,6
DDP is the future,4
"Guys, noob question and I think its a complicated answer. But how does the position of batting matter? Some batsman like being an opener vs few like to be at No 3/4. What changes for those positions?",3
"Padikkal gonnascore a 50, stats dont look good for MI here",4
Rocket powered Padikkal today,3
bruh padikkal’s tall next to QDK,5
Absolutely not understanding the decision to keep Bumrah in the covers wtf!?,7
"Virat ""can't hit boundary before facing 20 balls"" Kohli",10
"Bumrah be like f  it, I ain't running anymore",4
Devbutt,6
"When I'm in my dying bed, my last wish would be to see Bumrah diving to save a boundary.",9
"Oh sorry, if paddikal can do that regularly, i dont hate kohli's tuktuk all that much",4
"The field placement is pretty bad, ngl",5
terrible field placement if it's happening twice,5
"Batsman : pushes for a single

[Fake crowd](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=z-JRdRXiNv4)",4
If Paddikal gets a big innings here he might get ahead of Bishnoi for EPOTY award,2
Feel like Bumrah is being just a wee bit conservative on the boundary.,3
"The fast bowlers avoid diving while fielding, right? Right now Bumrah could have stopped them, if he dived - but the danger of injury is there. Now connecting the dots, have noticed that most of the fast bowlers avoid it (exceptions are there).",4
Oh God Kohli,2
Kohli struggling,1
Padikkal is hitting boundaries bcoz he’ll have to run anyways from the other end so atleast he’ll only have to run half of them now because of hitting boundaries,2
Trying too hard mate,2
Man fuck this guy,3
"Paddikal drives a ball


People:  mini YUVRAJ!!!",3
Koach what is you doing?,4
Bumrah must be pissed that Pollard chose to field first. Now he can't see what Siraj does and try to imitate it in the second innings.,8
Kohli looking off touch today,4
Just want to reiterate that I’m a Krunal fan. Not super talented but by god he’s an intelligent player.,4
tf is Kohli doing,2
Still can't get over Josh wicket. Hope Padikkal score 100,3
Pls Kohli don’t fuck up this start,3
Thala Kohli,3
"Kohli trying too hard to get a move on

Reminds of wi match in hyd",3
Kohli please don't fuck this up!!,6
"Alright. Nailed the first half. If you had asked any team to take around 90 for 1 wicket down at 10 overs, they woulda gobbled it up. Just keep going.",4
lmao,2
"wtf kohli, let Paddikal play",7
Kohli is struggling here.,0
"I just have this attachment to players like KL Rahul and now Devdutt who got big in RCB. can't ever be unhappy watching them play well, it's like how it must be like seeing your son grow up",2
This fucker thinks he's the world boss,0
Kohli trying too hard?,0
6(10) so far,0
Kohli really fucks our middle over rate,9
Paddikal not struggling against spin today. Impressive.,6
Kohli trying to do a tewatia,2
Wtf did they kept saying lmao it sounded hilarious,2
"who said thala left indian team, We still have

Thala kohli
Thala Pandey
Thala Pant
Thala Gill",7
Kohli 4 dots really mate,4
Virat slow kohli.,3
"I told you Kohli has no experience how to play at 80-1, look at him perplexed out there lol  
Give him 3-1 and watch him roar",4
Krunal bowling a ball every 10 seconds here. Super stuff.,5
Virish Kohndey,5
SRH Scored 45 in their last 5 over yesterday when they made 220. If they bought a Middle order that could have been 250,1
Koach ffs,1
Aw man kohli please no tuktuk :(,1
Did Kohli take Dhoni’s jersey too?,3
Oh who would have thought Koach would become the weak link in this RCB batting line-up...,6
Lol what was that screamfest.,2
Why is Kohli so nervous today :(,3
Kohli kills all the momentum man.,3
Kohli never used to be this slow. What has happened to him?,6
Wtf koach,2
Scott Styris is on comms now :),2
Has Kohli regressed against spin? Seems to struggle a little these days.,3
What’s with this rookie player trying to get DDP out,2
Koach soaking up dot balls like he did in the previous matvh vs MI,3
They shout catch for everything.,7
"Calm tf down folks, even prime Kohli would take 10-15 balls to settle. He was never Gayle/AB/Russell to start hitting from ball one",6
Koach struggling to rotate strike. Surprising,4
4 dots on Krunal is how you lose T20 matches,11
"I saw CSK using that fielder next to the bowler. For some reason, it is hampering Koach's ability to score. Maybe cuz he can't get off strike.",3
Padikkal making his runs before getting tired out by kohli 's hiit,5
Kohli already into AUS-IND test series zone,6
Kohli's going for boundaries instead of singles this time but just causing more dots,4
Let Kohli practice for the test series ffs,5
Kohli doing a Thala.,6
Kohli not batting well and also running out batsman who is actually batting well. Just 2020 things.,8
How tf has Kohli already faced 12 balls wtf,5
"Virat ""Ajinkya Rahane"" Kohli",3
Thala is India’s captain? Again?,4
What constitutes a catch to Krunal?,3
This year's Kohli has turned into pre-2012 Kohli. Brilliant timer but not great at finding the gaps.,7
Yes please give strike to Padikkal,3
Kohli is programmed to not take risks till the death overs,4
"As Hyd fan, who is the better bet? Mumbai or RCB",4
Four dots and a single... Peak Kohli?,9
Y’all ruko zara sabar karo,8
Kohli just slowed down the momentum,5
Didn't Virat said he got back to form after the four against Bumrah in super over. Ummm..... Is this what form looks like?,11
Thought they will keep an over of krunal for ABD,8
Koach gonna take 25 quick singles only to see Kishan and De Kock cunt those runs in 8 balls,33
"Kohlis wasted 2 whole overs

For heavens sake you need to show the 'intent' you keep talking about",15
FFS Kohli it's IPL and not away England/SA tour.,13
[deleted],30
Kohli wants the title of Thala...,3
"More than 2 dots to Krunal, and batsmen should retire out of shame",6
This is going to be easy chase for MI. They need at least 185-190 to put pressure on Hardik and Pollard.,5
"Great show, DDP",5
Paddikkal smashing it!,5
[deleted],8
Devdutt my love,7
"How could you play four dots of krunal Pandya,like wtf koach",4
This has to be dev's best knock this ipl,8
Koach eats the balls saved by Padikkal,7
Deserved half century there.,2
Virat ‘SR is overrated’ Kohli,5
Kohli will either get out next over or go on to play an absolute blinder from here on. This is the gist when he proper struggles early in his innings,3
Padikkal 😍,3
Kohli pressure gonna dismiss Padikkal,4
Koach simping for singles,6
Well played DP!,1
"Paddikal has improved his agression a lot. I wonder, what problem Shubman Gill faces while doing the same.",2
Well played Padikkal...smoothest innings so far from him,8
Padikkal for capt of the Indian team,2
Well played young DDP,9
Top class innings from padikkal,7
DDP picking up Koach's slack.,3
Padikkal looking like the senior batsman again,4
lol @ Padikkal saving Koach's ass in that Krunal over...,3
This is a new side of DP I hadn't seen before. He's scoring boundary every over 😎,3
Kohli needs to rotate the strike at the very least.,2
DDP 100 incoming,3
Ddp gets 30+ RCB win confirmed,2
"Paddikal: keeps hitting in the same region 

MI : I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that",10
Pattison be like - 'Why do I always have to run to stop boundaries?',6
Kohli needs to just take a single and let Padikkal bat.,7
Vk MC,1
Padikkal really making up for Koach's tuk tuk batting,6
DDP back at it again with that half century,5
Kohli looking cooked. Time to drop him from the national side.,2
Dhoni was also at Kohli’s age only when he started slowing down,5
Koach would probably try to run a 2 at a 100m long six,5
Right time for AB to come in now,3
FFS Padikkal you are supposed to play well after you leave RCB,8
My boy DevD has announced himself on the big stage.,4
Koach be like - thanks chotte,6
"Kohli

Padikkal

Philippee

Abd",4
Kohli singlehandedly made Krunal's bowling stats look acceptable,1
Hasnt r/cricket melted yet for Kohli tuk tuk,3
Well played!,1
Is koach slowly moulding himself into the next thala. (Please say no),1
Brilliant batting this.,1
"I hope DDP doesnt get tired too quickly, have seen him get tired and not get enough power in shots",3
"DDP is hot, no homo",1
"Kohli made 1 off 5 balls in that over, Padikkohli made 4(1)",2
Krunal going economical for us once again....,4
Two overs should be enough for someone like. Kohli to get set right?,4
If kohli continue playing like this they'll hardly reach 160-170.,0
"Rcb fans don't like virat's batting. If that's the case,trade him to rr pls.",2
"It's crazy the amount of time Padikkal has hit in that area, maybe move the fielder by some feet in that direction.",1
"Krunal has to be MI’s unsung hero. People criticize him a lot over here. But remember that if he wasn’t an economical 5th bowler, Pollard would always have to bowl 4 overs and that would’ve cost you at least a couple games.",2
Koach please play your natural game. We trust you,2
Koach now this is too much I don't care even RCB lose this Match lose trophy but I want old Koach back  :),4
"Thala doesn't retire, thala leaves his hocruxes everywhere. It's in kohli, pant, gill, jadhav etc",8
Don't make DDP run 2's ffs,3
"Koach should drop himself, lmao",2
Kohli gonna tire padikkal out with the running,1
"How exactly is Koach coming in at 3 to strike at 90 helping our cause? That only works if others around him explode and DeVilliers aside, no one else gonna do it consistently.",2
"Batsman : *hits the ball out of stadium*.

WK : Catch!.",4
Kohli vs Bumrah. Juicy.,2
Boombox is back!,1
[deleted],0
"Don’t worry guys, Koach will run his way to a 130+ SR by taking 2s.

Edit: Nevermind. At least he realised he was slow and tried to be aggressive.",4
"CAN WE PLEASE PUT THE FIELDER CLOSER TO COVER THAT SHOT.  

Or stop bowling so short. Fucks sake.",1
"He needs to keep going, can afford to get tired and get out",1
Kohli has started to turn into dhoni.,5
Get them MI,1
Out,3
[deleted],9
Lmao,4
Why is Archer bowling for Mumbai rn /s,4
"Fuck the 2s, we want to see Paddikal",6
Fuck,2
Imagine being a relative from the US visit you after a decade and bringing you a Rs150 Cadbury celebration. Hooray!!,11
"Said it before, saying it again. Kohli will not make it to my World T20 XI.",7
"Well people don't need to worry that csk isn't qualifying this year. 


Tuk Tuk Dhoni might not be around


But Tuk Tuk kholi shall carry the legacy forward",14
Kohli needs to play better than this because is where Paddikal seems to give his wicket away,3
"It sounds ridiculous but given at how Padikkal is going, RCB are 10 runs short halfway through the innings.",6
Oh no Koach,4
Every time Saurabh Tiwary runs I feel an earthquake,11
"Ffs, Kohli...",6
Who was defending Kohli’s dot balls?,6
"Doesn't Padikkal look like Adi pinisetti, an actor in South Cinema?",10
Terrible knock from koach,7
Kohli should drop himself,2
Lmao koach,6
Koach is boom boom bunny 🐰,11
"Fucking hell man...kohli's gonna keeps running 2s, tire out paddikal and then he'll get out ffs",12
Kohli fucked it.,10
What was the point in that,2
"Ffs man, when did the Indian lineup become full of anchor role cunts who look like headless chickens when trying to maintain the run rate?",8
Bumrah gets Kohli!,1
We jinxed Kohli 😔😭,1
Bc Bumrah why did you get Kohli out now AbD will smack us :(,3
Give 2 samosa pav to tiwary for that catch....,3
Can r/cricket pls meme Koach back to form.,8
Great for aaarCB.,3
Bye koach,3
Kohli:(,2
"Nice, Now De Villiers has to come before death.",3
Bumrahs first IPL wicket kohli and 100th kohli too,5
Wait till the producers play an ad featuring Kohli,1
"Well, ABD incoming so I guess it's not bad",1
That's actually good for RCB. Can't believe I am saying this when Kohli got out,6
Can Kohli drop himself next game?,5
Fucking hell. Ab save us!,5
India's best bowler gets India's best batsman,0
:),2
Koach ate up 14 balls for that shit.,7
Thanks Kohli,6
Good for RCB,4
Bumrah took form from kohli,2
That’s actually the perfect thing to happen for us now,7
He grabbed it like a samosa.,6
So glad VK is out.,3
please give boost to paddikal before koach makes him tired,6
Incoming ABD 0(2).,4
"I'm sorry guys, I made Kohli my Fantasy captain,  I'm sorry",5
“Boys I know we’re a big fan of de Kock on this show”,3
Definitely looked inevitable the way Kolhi was playing..,3
Kohli's wicket has shifted the tide towards MI's favour.,7
Boom boom bhenchod,3
dafaq,2
Is Chahal better than Rashid Khan?,1
"Saurabh Tiwari taking that catch, wholesome for some reason <3",3
inb4 why de cock is not selected for Aus tour? /s,2
Fucking hell kohli,2
BUMRAH > KOHLI,5
"Chonker runs and takes fitness master's catch

Who's up for the fitness debate now huh ??

 /s",2
AB time,3
Iyeresque knock from the skipper. Imagine these two batting in t20s for India. Ffs.,1
"Bumrah's first wicket : Koach

Bumrah's 100th wicket : Koach",10
Kohli gone quickly again...very disappointing,1
Lmao samosa pav being adorable.,2
Rohit takes the catch. *RIFT™️ CONFIRMED*,-2
Good for RCB this.,3
Tiwari uncle took a catch!,3
Tiwary sitting there like a small samosa mountain,8
Honestly dont know if Mumbai shouldve taken Koach's wicket,4
Kohli looked so lost today. Good for MI but buddy we need you in Australia.,8
Our #3 and potential #4 in T20s are playing quite similarly and they are not playing well at all.,4
ESPNCricinfo: Kohli's wicket costed MI 10-15 runs,9
Kohli ably following Dhoni's footsteps in playing cautiously and raising BP on r/cricket. lol.,2
Just when I started watching koach got out,2
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
That's it Koach. Drop yourself for Parthiv for next match.,0
VK vs Vada Pav : the battle continues,2
When you realise Sandeep Sharma has better IPL stats than Bumra,2
Kohli needs to open. Push Josh to 3,-4
Kohli test performance in Australia is gonna be a huge question this year.,5
Oof there goes koach :(,2
"Fucking koach, you had one job to do",4
Bumrah's 1st and 100th IPL wicket : Virat Kohli,7
Atleast he will make the great minds of r/cricket happy by forcing a boundary out of nothing,1
Quick someone check if Tiwary ate the ball,4
ABD NEEDS TO STAY TILL THE END FOR US TO POST A GOOD SCORE,8
Aussie fast bowlers salivating looking at that Kohli dismissal.,4
InB4 ABD 89(27),9
That shot looked like a replay of MI vs RCB Malinga no ball game,1
Tfw /r/cricket rejoices Kohli wicket because of his SR 😳,7
"**11.2** Bumrah to Kohli, OUT, and Bumrah gets to No. 100 with Kohli's wicket **95-2**

V Kohli c Tiwary b Bumrah 9 (14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 64.28",3
"Virat is horribly out of form!!

We need him in Australia.",6
Kohli should really fucking change his approach. This quick running between wickets arrogance will take him nowhere in T20s.,11
Tiwary has been surprisingly good in the field.,5
"Naah, I'd have preferred Kohli staying. ABD gonna bang the shit out of Patty's 3 overs",6
Oh Koach!!,1
"BREAKING NEWS: SLOW KOACH derailed, nobody hurt.",6
Samosa pav's critic would have dropped that.,2
Abd pls make up for Kohli’s dot balls,6
So Kohli is Bumrah's 1st and 100th wicket. Damn.,3
[deleted],-1
Kohli is Bumrah's 1st and 100th IPL wicket.,11
Now ABD will come who always smacks MI. Bumrah should take the responsibility and get ABD as well now.,2
Everyone say thank you Bumrah,2
Shit.Kohli should have remained 5 more overs slowing runrate.,2
Seems Kohli took Dhoni's jersey last match,4
"Virat Kohli 9(14)


Huh, wondering where have I seen it before.",2
ABD vs Chahar!!!,1
100 IPL wickets for Bumrah!,6
Getting Bumrah against Koach worked,4
The amount of cringe I experience everytime i see the jio dhan dhana dhan ad is beyond expressible,4
"Krunal : I defend 

Bumrah : I attack",3
"Kohli materclass

Ab misfires n RCB fucked here",9
And he’s lost his form again.......,6
"Kohli knew he was doing it again, slowing the middle part. And them decided Bumrah was the one to take on after looking awkward against Krunal.",6
Glad he's out. But I just want Kohli to be in good form for the Aus series.,6
"I low key wanted Kohli to stick around longer..

Instead, in comes ADB with a platform set.",4
Inb4 Krunal gets AB's wicket lol,5
Kohli is Bumrah's 100th IPL wicket.He was also his first IPL wicket IIRC.,10
Paddikal could be in consideration for india if he does well domestically (no idea what his ranji stats are)— he genuinely looks the most confident of the young indian batsmen this ipl. Even has “technique” we indian fans keep creaming our pants about,8
Bad wicket to take. You never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.,3
"Kohli just isn't playing explosively for the past few matches, he seems to be in great form for odi but for T20 he ruins the momentum",3
[removed],1
That dismissal of Kohli reminded me of 2015 WC semifinal against Aus. He got out exactly like that.,8
[deleted],2
Just love it when Koach gets buttfucked by Boom Boom,7
we need some ABD magic to go along with DDP's show,3
Kohli: Boundaries are underrated,6
"This new kid Kohli is not good, I wanna see him dropped 😂😂",6
"Can’t believe people are complaining, at least he didn’t take up too many balls. He wasn’t connecting and decided to hit out or get out. Have you tried being a csk supporter in these situations?",3
Bumrah is genuine wicket taker just changes the game like that.,3
That would have been a six if not for Tiwary's gigantic mass exerting a gravitational pull on the ball.,12
"Another mediocre innings from the world's most overrated batsman.

He's just occupying Parthiv Patel's space IMO.",7
"Good opening partnership did this to Kohli, he forgot how to play when whole world is not collapsing around him",12
If Dhoni became Thala Kohli is becoming Nayaka,0
I love that Kohli is Bumrah’s 1st and 100th IPL wicket.,8
Koach is Bumrah's fuck bunny,5
Kohli was struggling... Padikkal and Josh-smith-phillipe looked so good,9
Be the light...to spread the light,2
"Kohli post match conference : **Strikerate is overrated**

It's conspiracy, I'm sure.",5
Abd will go out cheaply. Just got a gut feeling.,-1
Everytime I see ABD bat against us I get 133* PTSD,19
Ate up 14 balls to score 9...classic t20 kohli,18
[removed],11
MI trolling everyone by selecting Saurabh Tiwary... everytime he's shown on camera everyone's like hey there's Rohit Shar... oh,11
Downvote me if Tiwary doesn't look like vada pav XL (Upvotes not necessary),0
Abd man get out,2
Not sure why but there’s always something so likable about the big lads,5
If RCB get to 180+ they have a decent chance of winning.,9
170 should be the target from here,3
Kohli is waiting for Ind vs WI series in India on flat pitches to show how lethal is he in t20i.,6
AB 76*(38) incoming,4
"Rahul Chahar,  a leggie still has 2 overs left but AB comes to bat. Interesting",7
Sources have confirmed that rohit has been injured after motabhai made rohit do dhan dhana dhan dance for over 100 takes,8
RCB not gonna win a trophy until then free up funds for bowlers by releasing Kohli,3
Hope DDP can convert this to a century,8
Damn man....kohli killed all momentumw,12
I feel like Shivam Dube has been good with the bat against Mumbai,5
Have a feeling that we will see the old Morris the aggressive batsman tonight.,11
Time to drop Kohli from T20Is before the WT20,4
I want to see Padikkal go all the way to 3 figures. He deserves one,9
Scotty called this Ego battle in 2nd over already to hold Bumrah for Kohli,4
100% sure we're gonna lose all 3 formats in Australia.,-5
"Guy is upgrad legit?
My dog wants to do a MBA specialization from a top university.",28
1st and 100th IPL wicket for Bumrah : Kohli,13
Ofcourse Chawla is youngest to 100 IPL wickets,6
"As an SRH fan, rooting for MI win.",9
Tiwary is built like a teddy bear.,9
Would be a miracle if we can keep these guys under 190. That power play to start the match really hurt us.,0
ABD will probably get out very cheaply today,8
Lmao Kohli making a special appearance in Bumrah's IPL milestones,18
Haha it's funny to see a bunch of online cricket experts shit talk about the 'approach' and 'intent' of a player who literally averages 50 in all formats,42
Kohli killed all momentum and got out. A real Captain's innings.,17
Why did they complete overs of Krunal before ABD came? Krunal has been ABD's kryptonite.,12
Saurabh Tiwary went from poor man's Dhoni to poor man's Rohit Sharma,29
"Now, will pollard give one more to Bumrah?  Tricky call",3
Oof! AB served up a perfume ball first up. Mm mm mm. Love this contest.,4
Pretty nice for Bumrah to have Koach as his 100th wicket in IPL.,10
How much relief for all the Indian Batsmans that they don't have to face Bumrah !,9
"So much hate on Kohli here, and people preferring ABD, support Indian made products under Atmanibhar initiative",6
Jasprit Cheatcode Bumrah,7
Ngl Tiwari looks like a dollar store DJ Khaled,9
We hit avg 10+ rpo since the third over then Philippe fell,11
I am always nervous about ABD until he starts hitting,42
"Kohli should stick to ones and twos, it'd been working well for him and he's not a natural powerhitter.",2
Bumrah saving captains ass since 2016,34
"Bumrah first wickets were also kohli and abd.

It would be fitting that 100 101 also be them.",5
"Where are people making fun of my boi Tiwary, those are muscles not fat",9
[deleted],-3
Looking at a below 150 kohlapse today. Don't think they can play spin cleanly,4
"MI with a better NRR, looks more assured to go to playoffs unless they play very badly. 

So as a Hyd fan, with heavy heart, I say, Comeon MI...",9
Yeah we are scoring again at Run Rate of 6 in middle overs,7
Boundaries are overrated anyways,6
Need to get ABD out early or else RCB will get to 200,9
"I was at home eating dorito when phone ring

'Momentum is kil'

No",17
Barring 2016 Kohli is a different player when playing for the national team,8
"Paddikal must be thinking all these Kohlis/Finchs/Phillepes are so shit as a batsmen, but son wait for your Australia/England/SA tour.",6
Jio are also the sponsors of KKR. Why isn't there any Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan ads involving KKR players?,4
What a fucking ripper this ball was,8
Kohli hasn't been in the form of his level since 10 months now. I hope that changes in Australia series.,8
"As an Australian, I agree with the comments in here to drop Kohli in all formats",48
Ab no need to rush plzzz,7
"It's criminal to not show that Govinda CRED ad for half the season .

Chintu tormented us for quite some time",9
"INB4, MI lose early wickets in the chase but an 85 run 5th wicket partnership wins them the game",8
Bumrah's 1st and 100th wicket in the IPL were both Virat Kohli.,7
Should have sent Gurkeerat in first,2
"""I lost my heart to Virat, one of the Dream11 fan girls said... For the million time.... He's taken, girls, he's taken!!!""

TIL Swanny is Team Anushka",8
Abd and Virat has same problem looks like.,4
Damn what the fuck is happening to Koach and ABD 2 games in a row,3
Apparantly Creds first 2 ads worked so they made 2 more of the exact same ones. Bro ever heard of diminishing marginal utility?,9
Okay. With AB struggling. This looks dusted.,5
Oh man ABD pls,2
Someone calm AB down,3
ABD should let the senior pro play the spinners,3
Feels bad watching these comments as a koach fan,10
Wtf is you doing AB bb 😔,1
"r/cricket to someone that averages above 50

Play better bro",18
Any rcb fan feeling tensed?,28
ABD is fucked against Chahar.,6
Do people need to bring up one of the WC Semis whenever he gets out of a bouncer or a left arm pacer.,7
Quick maths ™,3
Chahar bowls either rubbish or rippers. Nothing in between,6
"Pls dont give me a heart attack, AB",14
Man my boy Bumrah’s thrashing em,5
How do the two best batsmen of the last decade both struggle against leg spinners?,5
I feel DP's gonna throw it away because of vk and ab.,2
Get off strike AB,2
"Abd, please save us again like last time you did against MI.",8
I remember AB used to get out to Krunal a lot. It's a good thing Krunal has already completed his 4 overs then.,1
"People shat on RCB management for sending ABD at 6, maybe they had a point",3
Want to see Gurkeerat and dube bat well today,7
De Cock smirked at ABD oh boy MI is done now.,4
How should I sell my soul to Satan so that RCB win?,10
"as a 90s kid who grew up watching mediocre Indian pace attacks in the era of McGrath, Donald, Ambrose & Akram, it's such a pleasure to hear the commentators referring to Bumrah as the *world's best bowler.*",10

So let’s roast abd too",13
Damn we really slow down like crazy in the middle overs,9
Kohli is 31. Dhoni was 33 around 2014 when people started memeing him. Give him 2 more years guys he's the best player in the world.,5
I wish Mishraji was fit for us. Would have sorted the ABD headache,6
Fuck man Kohli ruined all that momentum,11
boomboom listen so like can you marry me,2
100 should have come 2 overs ago actually.,5
"Damn TIL Bumrah's first wickets in:

IPL : Kohli

T20I : Warner

"Out of the memes ,stuck in the middle overs.",3
imagine being in bad form and still being the 3rd highest run scorer in the tournament,11
Padi please shield AB from Rahul thanks,4
How does ABD who dominates every world class bowler on the planet struggle so much against literally any above average leg spinner?,7
RR was peaking at 9+. It's back to 7. something now,3
AB gonna wreck us,2
I was admiring how well Chahar is Bowling then it hit me that RCB have Chahal. I hope dew makes sure he doesn't do much,3
RCB Fans:  *90% of the things you worry about are out of your control so it’s not helpful to worry. The other 10% you can control so do something about it instead of worrying.*,5
MI seem to be that team that need at least one wicket to gain some confidence.,2
Virat destroyed the momentum of the innings.,12
Don't come at me but Rahul Chahar really have a punchable face,10
Govinda in his vintage form in that cred ad lmao,2
The middle overs run rate still shite fuck this man 13 years rcb fan same story,13
Just 12 runs for 1 wicket in last 3 overs for RCB....,8
Quinten lmao,3
"Krunal Pandya wicketless for so many matches?!!?! I thought that he was the purple cap holder with all those stares, abuses and other acts...",8

Powerplay ruined.,14

Kholi is a great ODI and a Test player. T20 not so much,1
Just 29 runs from last 5 overs. Unless a major makeup comes RCB have knocked their win chances down this phase,6
"Anyone else tired of ""we 90s kids.... bad pace attack.... spinner Venky Prasad..... Bumrah..... now happy"". Like we get it now",9
Run-rate less than 8. When did this happen lmao,7

21 balls for 15 runs. RCB hit the Banglore traffic,6
"Still in awe of that Kohli innings. He's played some absolute stinkers this season but that innings was basically the essence of how India's white ball batting is 3 years behind where it should, distilled in to 14 balls.

No plan, no matchups against certain bowlers, no attempt to impose yourself on the game, just try and block and run for three overs on a flat pitch where your openers have got you off to a great start and you'll definitely make up the runs by the end of the innings because reasons.

Smith might have been in bad form but at least he hasn't wasted this many balls with his mindless slogging.",8

We are scoring below our Average middle over run rate different match same story,3
ABD,3
I wake up every morning and thank the ALTROZ and it's spacious interior and high end music systems for the glorious day I'm about to have.,11
Here wego again,4
ABD starting the fireworks early today.,3
"From an excellent start, to a struggling middle overs and to a Khollapse. Story of RCB",4
Danny really said zZzZzZzZ,2
"Every RCB match, We were 100 in 10/11 overs. We could have got 200 easy, but we slowed down in the middle there... We could get only 160-170.",7

Holy fuck what a maneuver,7

"ABD will fuck MI, just watch",10
"Looking at you Delhi Capitals, I now actually have to watch this match because you can’t seal the top spot.

First scoop of the tournament for AB! Takes you back doesn't it? We used to have a couple every match!,3
A fucking 180 degrees six. Bravo,3
As a mumbai fan the memories are painful,3
"Fuck off AB, don't score against us please",-1
Patto started the tournament so well but has fallen off,2
Now Chahar won't trouble him. He only gets troubled before getting set.,6
"Spinners   vs AB!!

That's all you need to to Polly!!!",3
Just in :- Kohli to retire from all formats after keyboard warriors of r/cricket don’t like the way he bats.,22
Bruh Patty's bouta get smashed,2
RCB is not Winning this with the bowling they have anyway against MI batting. Just enjoy ABD batting and go to bed.,10
Kohli has had only 3-4 meaningful innings this season right?,2
Thank god its not no nut november cause I would have lost so fast,9
ABD and Pattinson just relieved all the pressure,2

Lmao how can some of you say that kohli should not play for india wtf,6

"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
Anything less than 200 with the batting they have left is a win.,3
I have a feeling that Kolhi is gonna be the highest run scorer in India Australia tour,10
Polly kaka bowling karo na,9
That moment you realise that Kolhi has been mostly responsible for RCB's terrible performance in the middle overs..,11

"Never been happier after Kohli got out, wish he got out before the dot balls",15
rohit injured right?,2
Cunt him boi!!!!!,8
scott styris about to murder the producers for the dugout guru award,5
ABD loves pace. If chahar doesn’t get him out and Padilkkal looking smooth we’re in for some trouble,6
Padikkal u beauty,3
Anyone else see the rockstar umpire there for a second,6
DEVDUTT ABD PADIKKAL,3
That looked straight up in the air for a sec,3
Padikkal should start hitting and be more aggressive with morris and dube still in depth,10
Peak Padikkal right here,2
Is Paddikal in the white ball squads to Aus?,3
No wayyy gey padikkal idiots. ABD and him will smash us out,2
Lmao did anyone else notice the running pirate,4
I saw the Jallad umpire there!,4
Absolute tonker,0
Doesn't matter where you pitch the googly if it's that full,2
"If nothing else, Padikkal has been quite a revelation this IPL.",7
Ddp is gonna make a century today 😋,0
It looked high... but damn...95 mtrs,3
Chahar is almost done with his 4 overs and De Villiers still there. RIP MI,6
"For ppl criticizing kohli for how he plays, realize that he partly has to do that because the middle order is trash barring abd. And he needs to take the game through in order to avoid a collapse, hence why he doesn’t start hitting till the end.

Abd is a phenomenal player but he can seldom take the innings through with the strike rate he plays at for 10-15 overs,",15
Padikkal just play this over.,2
Chahar reminds me of the kind of guy who plays the loyal friend to the hero in subaltern settings in Bollywood movies.,2
Long hair umpire seems like a true fan. Runs to get every ball after the six,5
I remember some people saying Rohit as a captain is overrated because MI is so good of a team it doesn't need great captaincy to win. Last few matches have been a bit of a defense in his favour looks like,7
PADIKKAL YOU BEUT,10
Padikkal gunning for that 100,6
"That ad is wrong.

Kohli was struggling on outside off deliveries and not getting bowled",2
Padikkal offside game is godly,5
180 would be gettable for Mi here without Saini,1
"Kohli was Bumrah's 1st wicket as well as 100th Wicket in IPL.

What a great beginning and end to his career",9
Paddikal century plz,3
"Padikkal shielding ab, fuck",6
"Pattinson sucks man. We need to be rolling with NCN instead.

Especially because it allows us to bat even deeper, while still giving us a decent bowling option.",5
That 6 was satisfying asf. Beauty,5
Padikkal century today please. That lad deserves it today.,1
After watching dug out commentary it is hard for me to go back to regular commentary.. anyone else enjoy dugout?,6
We’re in big big trouble,2
"Padikkal hits all on the off

MI bowlers : off side it is",8
"It’s amazing to see Padikkal hang in here and continue finding the boundary, clearly his fitness is improving",6
Paddi is showing great intent today let’s zooooooooo,4
Wicket alert after bowler gets smashed should be disallowed anyway.,1
"Padikkal is such a good find for RCB, they rolled 2 6's",10
Should have been taken,3
Padikkal century coming,6
"Chahar too Bowling at 100 now,",3
Wtf happened to our bowling,4
We've been just trash in the field.,8
Devdutt Padikkal is one beautiful creature. He's a champion. I love him.,11
Padikkal saw some comments on r/cricket about his strike rate today.,6
budget pandya at it again,5
Good that Kohli got out.,7
Koach not playing well and 1 youngster trying to give his best and try to increase the run rate? Just doesn't feel good :(,2
"DDP for century. Come on laddie, do it. **JUST DO IT**",6
"Not ma boi Rahul, he's innocent with the dreads",5
"Man, Paddikal has worked on his aggression so well. I wish Shubman Gill also works on this aspect.",6
Its lovely to see Chahar getting cunted,6
Dev is so much more relaxed and in better form when Kohli isn't there because he knows he won't be out of breath all the time.,27
[deleted],4
ffs Krunal,3
"So the supposedly Best Bowling units getting thrashed in the business end of the tournament, nice",5
Thank you Krunal. Very Cool,8
This is such a crucial innings from Padikkal. He's the reason why Chahar isn't going 3-4 an over as he easily could have here. In fact has plundered him and that's given them the impetus again.,12
RIP MI vs DC final,4
Protect abd against leggies at all cost. Need him to bat at the death,5
WAS IT FUCKING KOHLI ALL ALONG? FFS,12
I hate Pollard for slowing down the game when batsman in flow,5
Padikkal deserves to be paid wayy more honestly,11
Disappointing from Virgil van dijk,7
That was a chance right?,7
maybe DDP plays better when his partner isn't making him run marathons ......,19
Is anyone else's stream also spasming out repeatedly and going to the 'we'll be right back' screen?,4
Somebody stop padikkal,4
My favourite thing in cricket is watching players pick gaps perfectly and Paddikal is doing a great job of it,12
"Kapil Dev PG-13: *Aa raha hai aisa show, jo aapne kabhi nahi dekha hoga.*

Kapil Dev IRL: *Ek aisa show aa raha hai gandu, jo tere gandmare khandan ne dekhna toh dur, socha bhi nahi hoga bhenchod.*

Trans: a show is coming which you haven't seen; a show is coming asshole which your whole family haven't seen or heard about.",2
Yess Padikkal covering for ABD.,9
paddikal 10 away from becoming RCB's highest scorer this season,13
Yes and this is Chahar's last over too. Now ABD can accelerate from next over..,8
"No Luck today, have it your way then RCB, defeat us.

ps: reverse-jynxing like the SRH fans",-1
I'm praying Padikkal gets a century tonight,5
I'm Kohli worshipper but I hope he lose his captaincy for his own good. That burden is taking him down.,0
Paddikal is batting well but he is being served balls short and wide by the spinners like it's prasaad.,16
Koach was the imposter all along smh,10
Is twitter down?,1
"This is so stupid 
 
Should have just darted one in to get DDP offstrike so that he could bowl at ABD",5
"With ABD getting set and Paddikal showing no signs of slowing down, this could become very tough for us",11
Padikkal has a strong off-side game.,11
Krunal Pandya has to reflect on his cricket come back and show that attitude on field,3
I think Padikkal should get a chance in the T20I team,4
Discount Van Djik got tonked in last two games,9
"Ab is the best RCB batsman this season

DDP is the best RCB indian batsman this season

N obviously Kohli is the best RCB captain this season",12
200 still on the cards. Time to go for it guys,6
RCB slept on Padikkal last season.,2
"Jeez. Great counter by DDP. 

Boult has to bowl 2 out of 5 left.

Fuck.",1
70 off the last 5 overs and we have a slight chance against this batting with our bowling,5
RCB gonna score big only for QDK to hit revenge century against them,8
Padikkal is a better T20 player than Gill.. change my mind if you want..,15
Koach new ad looks dope. Boom Boom 💥,2
Chahar > Chahal ? Agree?,-5
Just noticed he’s wearing a Kapil Dev shirt. That’s a great gesture.,1
I think Devdutt has overtaken Gill and fraud Shaw as India's best opening prospect.,1
idk why gurkeerat is in playing xi?,1
"Think of Williamson for srh. No one expects him to start blasting from the start, and are ok with him hitting towards the end.

Why can’t virat do the same?",10
"Everyone asking ABD to be roasted for his slow start seem to forget his innings this season


73* (33) V kkr


55* (22) V RR


55* (24) V Mi


51 (30) V Srh

Lol RCB wins 7 games almost 4 games thanks to this one guy. 


So everyone with all due respect please STFU.",8
"RCB this is your year to win, if MI win 1 more from here I will be happy",2
Who is next ? Morris or dube?,1
Devdutt went from Dotdutt to Dashdutt in one innings,5
"If Bangalore stuck to their locals...

DDP Rahul and Mayank fuck man",9
Never realised how much of a vital role Rohit's captaincy used to play. Looks like without him we're falling apart a little.,8
Rcb is doing well with an off colour kohli so far. Hope he finds his touch asap,7
Shite fielding from MI,1
Pollard about to get smacked so hard,4
Will india Australia matches be shown on hotstar?,3
Would love to see Padikkal and Pant bat together someday,3
So all the *has beens* are using Cred.,3
I don't have good feeling about Pollard's bowling,1
Wtf,2
Rohit's captaincy is being missed,2
"I would keep the LH-RH combo going. Gurkeerat if AB gets out, Dube if padikkal gets out",2
Padikkal looked promising this year... Biggest challenge with him is he is an opener,2
De villiers gonna destroy pollard lmao,1
Lmao Polly with his dollys,3
KP showed the world the way forward. Tall batmens are the best batsmen. Now we are seeing them come through in Padikkal and Zak Crawley.,3
"Kohli opened before for RCB sometimes, why didn't he this season? Could really complement his current form.",1
Pollard against ABD what,6
Pollard subscribing to the 6D school of captaincy.,6
They need to cunt him this over,2
Pollard w 100 kmph,3
Polly vs abd this has to be entertaining.,3
Aala re aala polly kaka aala,3
Must have hella courage to come and bowl to pollard at this stage,3

Wwttff,4

And AB is OUT just as I type this! Wow wow wee wow.!!",7
"It's not about matchup lmao 
 
Polly just really likes to bowl",3
No ball!!!,-2
This wasn't supposed to happen. Fuck.,8
That's -30 runs right there for RCB,12
Has there been no CEAT tires timeouts?,3
Polly makes batting and bowling look soo easy,8
Lmao that was fucking quick decision,6
wtf,5
"Who comes in next, Morris? He can surely cunt the ball a long way",3
"Out of all people, Ab has to get out to Pollard",11
"Not just best bowlers & batsmen & allrounders

But MI also has the best fielders in the IPL.",2
Y'all didn't believe me when i said AB will go cheaply.,3
Aaaand there goes my hopes of 190,5
Wasn't that clearly above waist high?,2
Yup we’re done,5
Lol what,6
I think its clean,1
"lmao no way KEIRON POLLARD, REMEMBER THE NAME",8

What a decision to bring himself on tho. Can't believe AB took the bait.,13
That is so fucking baby soft af,8
I’m out of the loop. Why is pollard the captain? Wasn’t it Rohit?,1

How to get AB de Villiers? Dibbly dobbly rubbish.,16
Fixing hai,-7
2020 continuing to surprise us in mysterious ways.,3
What a rubbish ball by Pollard,9
And just like that 40 runs disappeared from the target,17
Bowl shit get wickets,11
Oh dear truly,2
not a no ball. Would have been below the waist in his normal standing position,10
Get Ready to see the Pic of ABD hitting the ball above his waist to be spammed everywhere with is bent legs cropped out ofcourse,17
Guys Pandya like inning coming from Dube,4
Gg lads 😒,10
170 might be face saving now,6
This is a good chance for Dube and Gurkeerat to prove themselves with the bat. Paddikal could also look at getting 3 figures.,8
Top 2 is lava,13
Ambani doing bits once again,5
DDP pls clutch this we need 180 at least,8
Shivam Dube masterclass incoming. You read it here first folks.,19
That’s a 30 run bonus at the minimum,17
Well played MI. Gg.,4
I was just about to vent my anger on how Pollard acts like a gully kid who owns the ball and tries to bowl every match despite having better options.,43
Well that sucks,8
A par score looks bleak now,6
"*If you want something done, do it yourself*

Oh Captain, My Captain.",10
Morris will have a blast now.,7
Chalo now this is chasable,16
"Guys, I think I can also bowl that ball and have an international career.",18
Dube has to go for the big shots now,12
No one smashing Bumrah from our side now,11
FUCK MAN FUCK FUCK,5
Looks like the guy puts no effort wtf Polly,1
"That was clean,right?",3
Stop this torture.,2
"ABD got out to a full toss, that too by Polly. WTF.",8
"Gurkeerat, Dube and morris all can smash",3
Save us dev,7
**leading from the front my man Pollard**,4
We are still losing this. They have already made too much in the first 15 overs for this ground,4
"This is good conditioning for the RCB team, let their middle order play more - overall development is the key.",3

Bumrah or goat polly?",5

RCB to do get RCBed now",4
"And yall were shitting on Pollard's bowling , he's kieron 'mgrath' pollard smh",2
Perfect Yorker by Pollard,10
Fuck you Pollard.,6
Sridharan sriram advising Morris how to bowl the slower cutters,5
Bruh rcb needs acc,3
Pollard always bowls the worst delivery of the match and manages to get a wicket,11
Both Virat and Abd failed. This will be amazing to see how RCB play.,11
"Wasn't that a no ball? Looked like it was above the waist, wtf??",-1
De villers could have hit it anywhere but he was aiming for the Altroz because of the sheer contempt he has for it.,20
Dube or Gurkeerat?,3
RIP chances of getting 200. I'll definitely take anything over 180 now..,7
Yes yessssss abd gone,-1
Congrats to MI first team to qualify for the play-offs,4
Morris needs to smoke some now,7
Koach was the imposter,6
"Pollard had got him 3 times out of 7 earlier.

It was a clearly tactical of Pollard to come bowl himself as that's what Captains who take responsibility do.",11
"After being RCB fan for past 10 years, I should have learnt the lesson of not getting my hopes too high",8
such a promising start too. This slide down all started with Philippe's soft dismissal,9
Padikkal deserves a century,6
4th time Polly has taken AB’s wicket in T20s for just 30 odd runs,9
Now the remaining overs being Boult and Bumrah is giving me alot more confidence,5
I dont even know whats going on anymore,2
"want Shivam Dube to do good and DDP to hit a century, but want MI to win ... I really hope we chase 200",2
"Would be nice if RCB had any batting/ finishers below 4.  


Oh well",5
RCBs choke began last game,8
Inb4 Dube 30(10),0
RCB gonna win today,-2
Fuck you pollard and MI. Just let us win this damn it you guys will make it later anyway,1
That's it guys. It is Padikkal'a day of reckoning. Go for the 100 boy!,3
[deleted],7
[That's all folks.](https://i.imgur.com/EL4PfQF.jpg) We have lost the fight but not the war. Next match it is!,4
"Kohli and ABD have both got out to bread and butter shots. Just one of those days I guess. RCB needs to prove that they can win a game without them firing, no time like the present.",7
Thank god kohli didn't send gurkeerat to have left and right handers,7
Have to mute the erectile dysfunction ads in a socially conservative Asian family,15
"Prediction? Could go either way now, but advantage MI because ABD won’t tonk their bowlers at the death now.",8
"Dube, Singh and Morris are our only hopes now",3
Jezz this Rcb ads are proper cringe wtf was that,4
[deleted],-4
Pollard is RCBs kryptonite fuck,4
"The problem with Kohli's knock is that it slows the innings considerably, this works only if he stays till the end to accelerate again but he gets out and the momentum is now gone. This is not just with Kohli but every Anchor",17
I hope Dube smashes. Has a good record in domestic,3
We are fucked. Next match with SRH and then with DC.,2
Paddikal just find the 4's No need of 6,10
If this ball was bowled to ABD would have been a 110 mtr Six,3
Paddikal is the main man now. MI has to find a way to dismiss him otherwise 200 is on the cards.,4
Which international team has the best chance to be champions for next WT20? My Picks: West Indies and England,3
BUMRAH 4 PRESIDENT,1
"Someone even said earlier when PP goes amazing, Kohli ABD don’t feel as pressurized they go out fast and cheaply sigh",10
"Vijay Shankar: Discount Hardik Pandya

Shivam Dube: Discount Vijay Shankar",12
I see 164/5,1
We have batting till number 8 but still no hope,4
"Mighty South African failing when needed most. Where have I seen this before?

All my life with the latest being just yesterday with Rabada.",11
Shivam DUBAI,6
Wasnt ABD a bit too deep in the crease which nullified no ball chances?,6
Just saw a stat that ab has got out to pollard 3 times out of 6 innings.what the heck!!!!,7
Man Pollard gets sooo many lucky wickets,11
Good thing is we have two Bumrah overs.,7
"Holy fuck this is some of the worst bowling I have seen, and its working for some reason",4
"We're gonna miss the playoffs cause of that match where they sent AB at 6, aren't we?",11
FFS after the opening. How did we end up here. Gonna be an easy chase for MI.,7
I can’t tell if pollard has fat on this tummy or like one of those muscular bodies where you look fat,10
"That gave me fever, jesus christ. I need to stop being that big of a fan of AB.",12
Ah man I was hoping for 200.,1
Kohli has got to bring back 2016 koach please,3
Pollard should bowl 1 more over.,1
26 balls with Sundar Mann and Morris in the shed attack ffs man,4
We are 35 runs short,4
Dube should just keep striking,4
Oh god pollard with his outswingers i tell u,3
Will padikkal be the youngest centurion in ipl if he scores a 100 ?,3
Ab d wicket costed RCB like 20-30 runs in the death,3
Pollard bowls really slow need proper power to him,5
six ball it was.,3
180 please......,4
Are they sending Padikkal along with team for down under tour as a reserve player for any of the formats? He is a solid player. Not only in IPL but even in domestic circuit he has been doing great. Actually expected a direct call up for him in either test or T20.,9
Wow polly with his 115kph looking dangerous now?,6
4 runs from polly over so far,4
Rahul Chahar is officially the most hated player by me :(,6
SA players are good AF,6
Was Rohit ever considered as a Captain for the national side ?,-1
So Dube doesn’t move his feet,12
Paddikal to entire Rcb batting line up : Insert Dream11 joke.,13
Pollard is like those annoying extra slow bowlers from Cricket 19.,80
"Wtf was that dube, no leg movement, no body movement it's like his swinging bat in air",6
[deleted],0
This is an epic bottling job by the middle ordee,6
I don't like the fact that Pollard is getting some purchase on this wicket. All the signs of a slow wicket and we are batting next.,1
Does winning this match guarantee that MI will qualify ?,4
Dube show some intent lol,5
Just wrap this under 160 man.. just too much pressure...,1
2 overs of both Boult and Bumrah..,3
Pollard's run-up is hilarious,4
Bc Kohli is fucking the momentum every match,5
Pollard I dare you to bowl one more over I double dare you,10
Lol Lara saying 175 would be enough!,6
"Y’all remember when we had dube in the Indian team haha

Good times",7
We’re going to lose aren’t we? :(,8
I'm launching the find my goat app ASAP,6
Can't believe Pollard managed to sneak in a 5 run over with the wicket of AB too.,7
Oh man Boult and Bumrah incoming F,3
"Jesus fuck, 5 off Pollard is criminal. How tf does his slow long hops not get cunted.",6
should have sent morris instead.,6
When will they learn that Dubey is trash,4
A lot rests upon Steyn Guns shoulders now,5
Pollard goes for just 5 bowling in 16th over LMAO,3
Abc's wicket gonna cost us 20 runs.,2
Single off the last ball? Come on.,3
RCB about 40 runs short,1
Exceptional over considering the circumstances. Looks like RCB could've used Udana today considering how much it's seemingly gripping.,6
Go for every ball,1
Koach needs to have more faith in the middle order and keep accelerating.,4
"This is the same team that scored 80 off the last 4 runs against us, I have no hopes",4
Should’ve been at 145-150 by now,2
"I was just watching highlights of 2016 Koach and goddamn what aggression, intent and hunger to win. Idk what has mellowed him down so much",7
It'd be a real positive for rcb if they post 180-190 with ab and vk,2
Great start from Phillipe,1
Wtff man Padikkal won't get a 100 now,2
Please Boult and Bumrah save this match!,3
"**400+ runs in an IPL season by players 20 years or younger -**

684 - Pant, 2018

439 - Iyer, 2015

432 - Mandeep, 2012

419 - S Tiwary, 2010

**410* - Padikkal, 2020**

*ESPNcricinfo*",9
Dube is worse than khaleel,1
I’m not into ASMR but if Brian Lara did it I’d pay for it,1
A person in wheelchair could bowl a action that shows more intent than the one Pollard's shows,3
So this is why dube was dropped i guess,3
All of you are shitting on RCB without considering that batting in the powerplay is the easiest time to bat now with pitches slowing down.,3
Paddikal 100  pls,2
Fuck Steyn is playing today!,1
The fuck......,1
"Goddamn this match just changed completely in the last few overs.

I thought for sure RCB was gonna get at least 190-195.

Two huge wickets with AB and Kohli.

We might actually hold RCB to under 170! Very chaseable.",2
Dube looks like someone is forcing him to bat,2
Please fucking drop Dube from the squad.,3
Boom Boom always smiling,1
Why the fuck do we have these tuk tuks everywhere,2
"Shivam Dube is the slowest ""finisher"" I have seen ever tbh",3
"I swear it feels like It'd be easy when Pollard or stoinis come for bowling, but those cunts break the back of batting lineup and leave",3
Would 175 be enough?,2
"Me sitting peacefully on my couch and enjoying the match.

Akshay Kumar: _aata goondna seekh gaye? 😉_",8
"Dube dude, this is the 16th over not the 6th.",9
The pitch has slowed down considerably. 160 might be above par.,6
Let’s stop them below 170,2
Imagine taking a single off the last ball when you're just defending in the 17th over.,4
YASS EASY WIN BOIS!!!,1
It was looking like 200 at one moment. Now they gonna crawl to even get 170.,7
Fuck,2
Morris please,9
Anything below 180 is a win for MI.,3
Should have sent in Morris imo,6
Polly being effective is probably the best indicator that pitches are slowing down and pace heavy attack is not the way to go anymore,6
Should’ve sent Morris,1
Cricviz: Kohli even after not timing 41% of his balls is in Top 4 Most run scorers this IPL. Tells you his quality and we should bow down to him!,6
"Kohli should reconsider his approach. He’s sucking the soul out of innings. At least if he goes hard at it, the middle order will mature faster",9
C O L L A P S E,8
Come on dube!!! Let's crack a few,2
Fuckin hell man,1
"Given the amount of times i have seen anukul roy as 12th man, i want him in playing 11 for a match at least to see how good is he at this level.",1
That was a 12 in Sharjah,4
"Bumrah is going to eat Dubai up, he has no chance and as i say that, he's OUTTA HERE SON",4
Press F for Dubeji,1
Fuck off man fkn useless cunts life sucks so much for an rcb fan,12
Is Twitter down ??,3
Crawl to 180 at least.,9
This was actually good for rcb,7
Yeah we don't have anyone to hit Bumrah,4
[deleted],1
Gube,27
Okay collapse now.,2
This is just shitty as it gets,2
Kohli happy that bumrah got wicket,2
Wasted 6 balls to play that shot..,4
Dube is such a chutiya.Why are you attacking Bumrah,3
"Okay so if you had to do that, why waste 5 balls lol!",2
How tf is Anukul Roy always on the pitch for us? Who's gone out?,5
"**16.3** Bumrah to Dube, OUT,  **134-4**

S Dube c Yadav b Bumrah 2 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33",3
Dubye,3
I’m livid right now...... what’s the point of tuck tuck and then Hail Mary outs....,9
What kind of asshole coaching staff sends Dube in clutch situation instead of Morris?,6
Now fortune favours MI,1
What's a defendable total now??,2
This is the work of analysts . No way in a sensible world that Morris comes after Dube . Just to keep left right combo . So stupid,4
fuck this shit i wish the worst upon mi,-1
K OH L A P S E,1
"This is just bad, took 5 balls to defend, atleast could have rotated the strike.",3
Mfs get to 170 atleast,2
Dube can only smash Mumbai club players on Wankhede pitches,4
I am so fucking done,3
How many times I need to tell you fellow RCB fans that Shivam Dubey is good but he isn't like Pandya :),2
Poor lineup by RCB today,1
Dube didn't look like he had any intent to bat today.,2
Dube looked completely out of touch,1
If morris doesnt come out now kohli is officially brain dead,2
Christ Bumrah is good,2
They made a mistake taking that catch. Thanks though.,2
"Aaaanndd this is why Kohli and AB play slower in the middle overs. Even if it's a deep batting order, they know that if they get out the rr will go down. Almost like a paradox",1
Is 150 gettable from here?,1
Dube was in Indian team?,1
"SEND MORRIS, YOU COWARDS",1
💞💞💞KOHLAPSE💞💞💘💞💘,2
I see Dube going back to his Ranji team tonight.,1
Poor Padikkal. Great innings gonna get buried under others not turning up,2
Is Anukul Roy always on the field?,1
I’ve said it once and I say it again; Bumrah is our lord and savior,1
"This is why Kohli and ABd eat us balls till the 16th over, cause this middle order is filled with utter nincompoops.",6
Who is that singing guy in the new cred ad?,2
Choked,5
"Leg spinners have bowled their overs , whyd they send dube over morris",5
Gurkeerat in this RCB team reminds me of the 2011 CSK team having Saha in the playing 11,2
"Dube is shit, isnt he?",1
The chase will be painful and quick for RCB fans.,2
Should Pollard take another over?,1
Dube following bc Kohli's approach,2
[deleted],3
RCB has good bowling to defend 160,1
RCB vs DC gonna be a virtual quarter final at this rate,7
"Brainless from Shivam Dube, defending 5th ball and taking single on last even after knowing that the guy on other side is striking well. And then getting out after eating deliveries.",0
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",0
Mistake not to rotate strike to Paddikal. The only batter doing work today really.,2
Absolute shit. The guy doesn't even show interest in batting. Should never get a game again in RCB,-1
Maiden in the 17th over only rcb can do this,4
"There's no way we cross 170 here with Bumrah having 2 left

Edit: fucking scratch that 150 is off the cards now",6
Only Morris can save them now,3
160 and atleast we'll lose gracefully to de cock and kishan,4
Even 160 is looking tough now,5
"Dube will still get in the Indian side in the future. Reminder kids if you're young, Indian and want to pursue cricket be a fast bowling all rounder",5
Forget 180. 160 only seems tough,3
"Virat and Dube both could have just rotated the strike instead of building up pressure by playing so many dots. 

Sounds simple but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",2
Fuck yeah!!!!!! Booom boom!!!,6
What the hell RCB.,5
"No one:

The guy in paytm ad:
Papa kehte hai 🎶🎵",3
Ffs,4
Fuck off Bumrah,5
[removed],2
If AB and Kohli don't fire RCB are finished. Maybe  Padikkal will play a good innings but that's it,7
Lmao RCB moment,7
Bumrah wreaking havoc,9
so the plan is to score 5 off pollard and attack bumrah? got it!,6
At least Tewatia managed to smack an international bowler for 5 sizes in an over. What are these losers like Dube doing?,2
ALRIGHT BUMRAH 😌,9
Boom Boom. What a bowler,6
"Before it was shitty death bowling, now it's the inability to keep the runrate flowing in the middle",18
"This Bumrah lad is pretty decent, he should get an opportunity for Australia tour.",16
BOOOOMIEEE 🥺🥺🥺🥺,6
I’m not even surprised.,8
Looks like 160 today lol,3
Peak rcb,3

Wow,3
Bumrah's ripping through the RCB line up lmao,13
Boom u beauty,3
Bumrah God,5
Kohli tuk tuk is better,7
Lmao,4
Now we know why Kohli and ABD play the way they do.,8
can't believe Philippe is making all these batsmen throw their wicket away smh,6
CHOKEDD!!!,3
Maiden with two wickets,9
That’s the advantage of having a cheat code,5
"**16.5** Bumrah to Padikkal, OUT,  **134-5**

Bumrah is THE final boss in entire cricket history,4
Yeah we're fuckedd now. Fucking hell. All time. Every time. They just cant see us happy can they,8

Bumrah is too OP for us without ABD,8

Hahahahah what the hell,2
"Anything under 180 is practically impossible to defend against MI. GG Mumbai, you deserve the top spot..",7
Bumrah and Pollard changing the result of the match,2
Heh so this is how it feels when a team other than yours is collapsing. I like it.,3
Kohli and Dube’s tuktuk cost Padikkal his wicket,4
*Kohlapse.exe is running*,10
"Boom boom

Good night RCB",6
"Well, this match is RIP. What a collapse, giving a run for the 17/7.  

I have no idea why they're checking their shots, and not having a full swing if they want to play shots.",2
Fuck me can’t catch a break,2
MI have pulled this back wonderfully. Fuck yes Bumrah!!!,9
Typical RCB are back,3
triple wicket maiden let’s go,4
Hello darkness my old friend,11

I trust my Mann.,3
Bumrah is a cheat code,4
Omg been stuck at 134 forever wtf,3
Paddikal faced like 10 balls in the last 5-6 overs. This was bound to happen. His teammates truly fucked him over lol,3
K   O    H    L   A     P     S      E,2
Always love a good RCB collapse.,1
Was hoping for a padikkal 100 man,4
RCB is fucked,1
Atleast reach 150 bois,1

Let’s goooooo. Stop them at 160 now please,2
Completely fucked,1

"SKY be like even beard couldn't get him into national team

EZ PZ wont even reach 150.,3
That's what you get for putting all the pressure on a set batsman.,1
"We should build a statue of Bumrah at Wankhede after he retires, it's crazy the amount of times he has pulled the game in our favour",11
What is the point of Gurkeerat. Bat 8 doesn't bowl.,4
Can we hold under 160? That would be crazy good.,3
Yeah. We're done. That's all folks,4
Only a dream spell by Lord Siraj and Lord Steyn can save us.,6
suddenly kohli's tuk tuk doesnt seem so bad....,13
Booom,4
Padikkal carried the scorecard today.,5
"I’m sorry Kohli for hating on you tuk tuk survival batting, I wouldn’t trust the middle too",12
C'mon mann do something,2
A beauty of a over.,2
I guess now we know why Kohli likes to play a little safe in the middle.,10
"genuinely curious, are bumrah and mumm-ra related?",2
Run a ball Gurkeerat is here,4
Sorry everyone that got offended by my comment today,1
Gurkeerat should’ve come instead of Dube,6
Boom boom Bumrah😂😂👍🏽,10
Why Bumrah? Bad manners,6
2 wicket maiden are you serious right now?,6
Kill me now please,2
Indian batsmen really cannot play against Bumrah....,8
"This is exactly why one of Koach or ABD should try to ""STAY ALIVE"" for the last 4-5 overs. 

Normally teams score 60-70 runs in the last 5.
For RCB, it's certainly not possible when ABD and Koach throw their wicket away trying to score BIG in middle overs 8 to 14.

I haven't seen another team management as overthinking and as tinkering as RCB.",4
"Started with 200, slipped to 180, felt like 170ish could be possible.

And now I wish RCB at least puts 150 on the board. 😔",6

Man give bumrah everything put him in a glass box,4
Double wicket maiden in the 17th over. King Bumrah,8
"Ever since JR Philippe got out, the momentum has been sucked out of RCB's innings, starting with the string of dots by Kohli.",6
I feel like kohli coming in at 3 is slowing rcbs momentum so much. Phillipe and DDP got a great start and then since Josh's wicket it's  all gone downhill,4
RCB are fluffing their lines as we speak....,5
Just Bumrah things,2
"Bruh. Bumrah is a fucking cheat code. 

DOUBLE WICKET MAIDEN 😍",9
Double wicket maiden - just Bumrah tings,2
Good night guys.,3
Double wicket maiden in the 17th over wtf,4
"The innings in phases: 

60/0 (7) 

74/5 (10)",7
Double wicket maiden in the 17th over. Bumrah is too OP,8
Does MI have any full time spinner apart form Rahul?,2
Jaspreet *RCB hunter* Bumrah,3
"Do you know Bumrah is the best bowler in the world? He can bowl length ball at death and still take wickets. Because of his action and accuracy, his 140 kmph ball feels like 150 kmph. On his best days, he is unplayable. If Australian pitches are similar to last summer against NZ, India will have a great chance to win at least one test if not more.",4
Of all the MI bowlers Pollard ends up being the one to personally break RCBs spirit. Didn't see that coming. Bumrah and Boult taking out the rest.,2
"Double wicket maiden in the death.

Fucking god of T20s.",4
 Bumrah fucked us up,2
"Very unimpressive from Kohli today. Sucked the momentum from the innings. 

I hope he plays more aggressively for India. For all I care he can score 14(21) for RCB 😉",3
Fucking wicket maiden AGAIN,3
"So whi would MI retain in mega auction , if they have to choose 3 from

Pandya
Pollard
Rohit
Bumrah",2
Double wicket maiden in the 17th......damn!,3
Double wicket in the 17th over. Bumrah saving our ass today as well.,6
Maiden over in the 17th,6
Lads. There’s a reason why kohli does tuk tuk motherfukers,8

I’d give bumrah a foot massage for free,4
"And just like that shit goes south for RCB yet again. Honestly as a RCB fan I don't expect much..but please atleast make the playoffs RCB, choke and lose like you always do after that but atleast make it to the freaking playoffs",4

"G Mann and Morris are out.
Let's hope they they do some good.",1
They better fucking attack this over,1
wHy DoEs KoHlI bAt TILl tHe EnD,2
Bumrah bowling double wicket maidens. Nature is healing,4
12 balls 3 runs 3 wickets,2
We should not look to take risks in the second innings this is a easy chase.,0
only rcb can play a double wicket maiden in the 17th,3
Bumrah ♥,1
"ABD is good, but cmon man. Rahul and Mayank have been performing every match. You need to too. This won’t cut it",2
Even 160 seems farfetched now,2

Fuckin two wicket maiden at the death including a wicket of a batsman on song (O_O),4
"Wtf RCB, are you worse than even DC man?",0
Who is gurkeerat and why doesn't koach want to bat him instead of these bowlers?,1
"Bumrah doing his own things, RCB doing their own things.",2
"Once Kohli and AB get out, the rest of the batting order collapses",1
Double wicket maiden in the 17th that’s ridiculous,2
Double wicket maiden at this stage of the innings...still the best limited overs bowler in the world.,2

maybe I am just not watching at the right time or has Chris Morris not done anything in years? Or am I thinking of Miller?,3
One more maiden and Lord Siraj level reached,3
"WTF, collapse happening",2
Bunch of losers,1
RCB back to meme-ing again!,2
Ah yes. Perpetual pain.,3
Welp Koach now has reasons to bat even slower from next game,7
RCB pulling an SRH lite here,7
RCB crumbling like SRH now??,6
LMFAOOOO L,1
"""Actually we wanted to win the toss and bat first""",4
Mumbai gonna chase this down with 5 overs to spare,2
This innings has been a rollercoaster ride,3
We have no finisher,3
Congratulations mi you have one this.,4
Wtf is happening,3
This is peak RCB,8
Bro’s. RCB IS BACK. Let’s gooooo,7
"Cmon rcb, 16/7, take the record away",6
"For the last few matches, apparently teams aren't flawless now you wonder. Every team has holes that teams have started exploiting.",12
Good guys RCB giving catching practice to MI fielders,6
"Which scenario is more likely :

Kohli leading RCB to their maiden IPL title
or
Kohli leading India to their second Test series victory in Australia",5
That was brain fart,4
"The mood swings RCB fans had in last 20 seconds 
Amazing",6
DC Morris was back in the last game so this is not surprising. Brain dead all rounder,4
These bc's are all getting out the same way,5
"Can RCB declare the innings? Just declare and bowl dude, you're not gonna make much more runs anyway",4
Ffs use common sense RCB. Such a bunch of losers.,1
You go hard on MI bowlers and then they'll come harder at you,8
"Now y’all realize what kohli is there for, he won’t give away his wicket in the 17th over, that’s all I’m saying",10
Kill me now please. Just end the misery.,8
"Seeing Pollard's bowling makes me hopeful that Dube can bowl well here.

And he better, after the way he batted.",5
"Why couldn't I just be a mumbai fan, why do I keep doing this to myself?",13
What the fuck is this. Embarrassing. And now watch as Dale Steyn dishes out pies to everyone.,4
"Don't worry guys, Morris played with a sr of 200!!!",7
"K
O
H
L
A
P
S
E

Back on the menu bois",4
Will the loss to arch rivals CSK hurt us ultimately for qualification,3
rcbs kryponite : bouncers lmaoo,4
Rcb vs dc for 2nd place bois,3
K o h l a p s e ™,5
Big bruh moment,5
The way Morris was hyped,6
Absolutely legendary collapse on display here,6
Might not even get to 160 at this rate,3
I'm sad Mo can't get in this team,3
Morris 😂😂😂😂😂😂,4
"Ahhh RCB vs CSK feel

Hope MI finish it a bit quicket",5
Classic RCB moment 👌🏻,6
Biggest collapse since 9/11,10
Peak RCB if they bow out of playoffs after hyping up almost everyone!,5
Lads its RCB.,3
Match fixing?,-8
Kohlapse,3
"As an SRH ""fan"", who should I be rooting for in this game? Does it matter?",2
Just rcb things,3
"10 minutes ago I was wondering if they should try for 190. 

Wtf just happened",4
Remember all this started when polly the goat bowled his unplayable fulltoss,7
"at least gurkeerat is there, get us to 150 pls",1
Padikkal and Philippe should simply just bat in every position,2
Comeon bois I want to see Bumrah vs Chahal,3
We are definitely regressing to our old self,6
KOHLAPSE,3
"**17.2** Boult to Morris, OUT,  **138-6**

CH Morris c Pattinson b Boult 4 (2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00",2
90/1 at one point lmao,8
WTF is RCB doing?,7
"Pollard you shifty fuck, stop celebrating",3
I was gone for 10 minutes. How did RCB go from 130-2 to 135-6....,9
"If RCB lose this and then vs SRH, and if DC lose vs MI, then DC vs RCB on last day could effectively be a knockout match. Nuts considering where these teams were at halfway in the tournament.",3
Why do we even let people like Bumrah or YRKFA play? It feels as unfair as letting Boris Johnson play rugby against kids,9
See that's the problem with us. A few wins from rcb and we start dreaming about qualifying and winning the cup. We need to know our place.,5
Kohli would've at least taken till 160-170 lmao rcb be careful what you wish for next time,3
Atleast get 160 FFS. Give Lord Siraj something to defend.,5
"Well the moment ABD gets out to a full toss from Pollard, you know things aren't right",7
Go go go go!!!!😂😂😂😂,2
Pls send Chahal,2
Lol this team will never win the tournament. Cannot even get Top 2 on its own.,10
"If MI wins this one, all teams will pray (except SRH and DC) that they win the rest two as well. The table drama has been intense in last 2 weeks.",4
Kxip and kkr should really be thanking us,10
"It’s hurting even more because they haven’t bowled exceptionally well,we’ve batted poorly and gifted them wickets",4
"Who would have thought RCB would be doing well in a season where Kohli is a shell of himself? So much of the blame is on him, they were going so well, until he came in. He is just out of form. Took away the momentum and progress when he came to bat. And then got out. 9 of 14 is really really bad for when he came on and how easy they were making batting look on this pitch.

Also AB did what he does so often. Get ahead of himself and let the lower order hanging. He knew Kohli was out. Him and Padikkal were the last known batsmen left. So many overs to go. He has a poor record to Pollard. He could have just played it out. We all know how he can capitalize. His dismissal angered me so much. He did the same thing when RCB were in the final against SRH. He can’t help himself and that is his Achilles heel.",8
At work and I'm laughing watching the RCB collapse lmao. So many terrible shots on short balls.,6
DC 🤝 BC 🤝 RCB,8
At least get 160 to make this an interesting game. Please.,3
We need a siraj special to show that he’s not a one night show,1
MI bowlers are playing RCB batsmen like puppets lol,6
Tbh I'm surprised we have this many runs with ABDK failing,5
MI gonna chase this in 15-16 max,2
"I swear, if Mumbai had gotten Rashid, him and Bumrah bowling for the same team would be literal HAX mode",4
Even 150 looks difficult now.,1
"Terrible batting.

Nothing else.",2
Morris walking back like a robot after getting dismissed.,3
PredictViz now says 161 with MI favorites to win.,2
Abu Dhabi is a fuckall ground,4
Last six balls 5/3,2
Scotty styris just nailed the pronunciation of Mohammad Siraj,6
We are at 4 wickets down for 7 runs atm. This is a legitimate run to rival 17/7.,6
"Forget the total. 

I hope RCB doesn't get all out before 20 overs.",8
Scenes if they finish at 149.,6
"Coming up in 2nd innings: Yadav to de cock, Siraj to Kishan",4
It's a disastrous collapse.,2
Pollard is a game changer!,5
"At this rate, I don't see them qualifying.
SRH and KXIP must qualify.",2
How pathetic for RCB despite the start they got,1
Mental torture,5
RCB returning to its peak prime form,5
We rely highly on VK and AB in the middle order. At the end of the day opponent is just 2 balls away.,7
Is Rcb's cinderala time period over.,12
17cr bc should be ashamed of his shitty batting,3
160 is like a dream at this point,11
RCB fans meltdown 🤝 DD fans meltdown,10
Lmao styris saying rcb can use bouncers at the death too and lara saying it might not go till the death...,9
Should just play to save face now. Dont get all out.,0
cameraman loves ABD,6
And it is that time of the match when r/cricket learns the value of hard accumulators.,8
"If sundar is not opening, I dont want to see him bat",8
Stepped out for 15 mins. WTF happened to RCB? They were shooting for 180+ at one stage,6
Gurkeerat do something for once,3
"16 balls. 11 runs. 4 wickets.

Ouch.",8
bruh,1
Gurkeerat this is your hero moment. This is what you've been waiting for kid,7
"Commentator : Chris has a job to do here 


Chris : Fuck, I totally forgot I need to make tea.",10
Kohli should have played normal and without caring about strike rate..,7
Simon Doull on Cricbuzz predicted 158. He might be onto something hahaha,9
Why do I even bother with this team,8
Last 17 balls 12 runs 4 wickets,8
Goddamn it. Here I was hoping for a 200+ score and this shit happens,3
If kohli has any brain cells left he shud be observing where the mumbai bowlers are bowling and seeing how the pitch is slowing down,2
Let’s remember there’s still one over of bumrah left,10
"Fuck just realized 17th over was a maiden was well with double wickets

Come on man who bowls maidens at death. Cottrell salute for Boom Boom.",13
Koach😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,6
Omg Kohli's expression 🤣🤣🤣,2
Now we should understand why Kohli slows down because we have no one below ABD. Should play Finch at 5 now no swing problem.,7
40 runs short.,1
Calm down rcb. You still have runs to play with it.,0
What does RCB see in Gurkeerat? He doesn’t look like a finisher and not wicket taking bowler either.,0
Lol G you’re a batsmen. More is expected of you,1
Brilliant captaincy by Polly to bowl himself and for that Bumrah over.,2
DC at least plays shit throughout the match and doesn’t give hope like RCB lol.,10
As a DC fan I want MI to trash RCB ngl.,2
18 in 2.1 overs please,1
"No middleground for RCB. Kohli was too slow and AB considering how weak their lower order is , was way too aggressive . Trying to hit every ball as early as 13th-14th over not a great idea.",6
RCB needs to stop chopping and changing their indian players in the side too much.,4
"4 wickets 7 runs? 

Srh fans: rookies",13
Suddenly Kohli's approach looking not so bad.,5
Now KXIP looks more probable to play that final........ But not with us.... Shit,9
"chuck the sr , just get a run a ball. Atleast 160",6
Time to move Philippe to middle order for stability?,-1
So no WLW pattern this time :(,8
Went from 129-2 to 138-6 real quick.,8
"I hate to write off a match, but damn.. Regular Collapse Boys are living up to it.",5
Kohlapse™,4
Resurgence of Meme Team - RCB,5
[removed],2
This is why Koach batted the way he batted.,8
MI Fans won't complaint even if MI does a Tuk Tuk today.,6
Sundar doing more than the batsmen,1
Bring boom boom finish this,1
"Boult has the yorker but won't execute it unless it is the last ball of the innings. It's the tail ffs,  dart those Yorkers in",5
bruh how many cred ads have these guys made lmao,3
Why I'm i even bothered supporting this team,1
"Bittersweet moment :(

Probably the first season in which Kohli's Captaincy is better than his batting",9
Commentators! Stop jinxing us so bad!,3
165 would be the best we could get,2
RCB will win next match by 100 runs guys don’t worry,3
20 in next 2 pls,1
Mumbai VS mix of world class and club cricketers,1
Kxip looking more and more likely,5
Vintage dale steyn to win this one for rcb,3
"I'm in a group chat where 70% participants are MI fans, and 25% are CSK who would give anything to see RCB lose... The fucking smugness in the messages is so frustrating",2
I think Kohli should go back to batting at 110. Clearly going after the bowling and getting out means everyone else also wants to do the same thing.,5
Washington Sundar needs some sponsors on that bat.,3
Cmon boys at least get 170 or something ;(,1
"200 is still on the cards 

RCB's best batsman Dale Steyn is yet to bat",8
Hoping for a Steyn special today,4
The unacademy ad is so depressing,8
Supporting RCB is injurious to health lmao.,13
[deleted],3
Why,2
Kohli looks like his own anime version,6
I am in for fifer from Boom boom,2
Bumrah shoul be illegal,9
Rabada's economy fucked by the beating he got yesterday,11
[deleted],10
Never question a man's tuk tuk until you've seen the whole being lineup play,1
Honestly I think 160 is defendable. This pitch isn't as good as Padikkal made it look.,6
SKY is very likeable,8
No other RCB match has angered me more than this one.,5
"Koach eating 15 balls in the middle overs and then throwing his wicket away killed all momentum.

If they lose this one is all on him.",1
After the powerplay it was looking like they'd easy hit 180+but after that collapse even 165 looks good,2
SKY looks 4 years young without beard,3
Most teams have spin bowlers bowling in the middle....and we have 2 batsmen who struggle against spin who came in during the middle overs,2
If Mi wins this year too (which is most probably going to happen) and no mega auction happens other teams should just not play and let them win why to waste time for 2 months just to see MI win the trophy (-_-;),4
Cred went big on celebs lol,2
I think its over for MI here. They cant chase 150,3
Why is gurkeerat still in the team?,2
"Well they wanted Dale Steyn instead of Moeen Ali, with MI having 3 Left handers in the top order.",2
Cant blame kohli now can you ? Similar thing happened with KL earlier,4
Unrelated note: Twitter down?,2
Negi > Mann,2
do we really not have anybody better than gurkeerat?,2
Just 2 RCB matches ago I saw RCB fans saying that they should drop Udana. And now they want Udana back.,6
Middle Order: Super (~~V)~~ Free,2
"Abd struggles against legspin means RCB will have a tough time beating Rashid and srh. If dc also beats them, they have a real chance of missing out. The memes would be insane",9
Lol they had to put subtitles on that Cred ad,7
Washington wasn't Independent. He was Republican. Look red,5
What's with all the players having a soul patch?,3
That guy yelling aala re aala awkwardly so cringe,5
"Wow, SKY looks just out of his teens after shaving",3
Who's better Boom Boom for T20 format? Boom Boom Bumrah or Boom Boom Afridi.,2
"ai ima say it, that beard cut or whatever is very bad lol",2
I hope Steyn Gun bowls like Bumrah today.,3
Hope only brings pain,7
I don't remember one match where gurkeerat has played a match winning innings,3
"Mumbai is not some person ffs 
 
what is even 'Mumbai aala'?",0
Bumrah na raj ma Motabhai majama,8
This is the first time I can think of when Bumrah is in Purple cap race otherwise he is economical,5
"Kohli should open, he definitely plays lile an opener",6
Bro sky without a beard looks like an average 16 year old from Bandra lmao,9
Rashid casually sitting there 4th on purple cap list with 5.00 economy. All this while pace is the flavor of the season.,7
[deleted],11
Casually bowling dot after dot in 17th & 19th over #JustBumrahThings,5
As a Saffer and an RCB fan I think I need to consider whether I have a secret choking fetish...,13
Gurkeerat sucks,3
"
Rashid: playing like a top bowler

Bumrah: playing like a top bowler

Rabada: I choose to die like my team",9
This is all the more disappointing because it was all due to poor shots more than good bowling,12
Gurkeerat Singh Jadhav,7
Loosing to CSK will be really hurtful,11
"Watching this as a fan of both RCB and KXIP, I'll go ahead and say it. We deserve that 2nd place spot. Not RCB. Imagine this game being the final. No. Just no. We can do a better job fighting MI than peak RCB.",11
CSK better win tomorrow,7
IPL should get an official Bruh moment sponsor,20
Not gonna be surprised if Sundar tries to hit Bumrah,9
It would be such a disappointment if India don't win a world cup with bumrah. He's the best bowler we have had in 30 plus years.,23
Thanks Devdutt and Phillipe for atleast taking us a place where we could at least get to 150. Reckon we'd have been a disaster if they hadn't fired at the start.,27
I feel today Saurabh Tiwary will have a good day today,7
Can we defend this?,4
We should have won against effing csk. I don’t know if we can qualify now,13
What is Gurkeerats role in the team?,2
Either play well and continue the momentum or play shit from the start... Wtf is this?? Not everybody has a health care plan bruh!,15
"Just imagine the obliteration, if RCB had taken UMesh today.",11
In that KKR match Bumrah's figures were similar until Cummins scored like 26 in his last.,4
"What is the role of Gurkeerat in this team

Bat while chasing 85 n bowl when defending 263??",36
"Even wicket keeper batsman Parthiv Patel looks better than dedicated batsman Gurkeerat, both in technique and effectiveness.",8
CSK looking to drag down as many teams as possible with them,10
[deleted],18
Our middle order is practically non existent lmao,10
Look man I don't mind losing once in a while but can we PLEASE not make an ass out of ourselves with every single loss,13
This fucker can't find timing,1
Gurkeerat trying his damn best and still scoring at 50 SR,8
Bumrah is a cheatcode,8
"Sorry RCB, you still can't pull of a SRH better than us",4
"MI doing what they are good at. Their players come good towards the end of the tournament. Hardik was back in form, Bumrah now, Pollard to follow later tonight.

Other teams get out of form",8
Chahal,5
Last 4 overs 21 runs 4 wickets. Damn.,4
"Open the batting with Boult and Bumrah, you cowards",9
How can gurkeerat be our finisher it's really a shame but we have no options also maybe play Finch at 5,7
"Teams are so shit, I don’t know how teams take pride in winning this thing /s.",0
RCB Kohlapsing...... no wonder they’ve had more South Africans in the team than any other side,6
"What a yorker

No idea how Sundar kept that out",9
"Whether we win or lose this match, lets accept, Bumer is #1. We were fortunate to have Malinga and now we have him. Take a bow my man.",9
Looking at t20 squad selected this is exactly how India gonna play in T20Is,11
Fucking unplayable,5
Sundar and Washington can't even play like tailenders.,8
Anyone remembers James Franklin? Least threatening cricketer I was scared of,2
"RCB should just play 4 batsmen and be done with it.
This is just painful to watch.",7
"Imagine a T20 attack with Bumrah, Malinga, Umar Gul, Rashid and Sunil Narine

I'd declare at 0/0 and punt on a super over.",6
toe crushing,3
"lol who was that behind chahal, seemed like he had already taken a 90 and staring at camera",3
Who does Chahal play for?,1
"Its hard being an RCB fan guys, its fuckin hard",6
"Fucking peach, shame it didn't hit the stumps.",1
[deleted],4
That yorker though... Daaamnnnn sonnn.... Awesome,4
Bumrah is only getting paid 7cr this is daylight robbery,8
Commentators suggesting Gurkeerat to play out Bumrah in 19th to score against Boult in 20th lmao. Bhai uska bat lag jaaye ball pe vo hi bahot hai.,6
Why is Gurkeerat even here?,1
Him getting a run out of that delivery feels illegal,0
How did it not crush stumps?,2
"Me being a csk fan have been an ill wisher for MI naturally, but I have to give it to their talent scout process and progressing the team with keeping the core intact which csk failed .. kudos to motabhai..",5
Washi survived Boom's yorker somehow.,4
That one over from Pollard genuinely saved the game,7
Would you send SKY instead of Kishan (left hander) to open cause Sundar will bowl 3 overs in PP,5
Bumrah you beauty. India's best bowler for a reason,9
36 runs of last over?,0
My Dad is MI fan and even he is trolling me now :(,17
"Masterful Spell. Too good Bumrah.

Let's keep this under 160 Boulty!",6
"Lol the Yorker was so good Sundar thought he was a goner.

 Only later did he realise that somehow he  managed to block it 🤣",7
Brilliant from Bumrah,7
Bumrah has bowled really well but ironically two of his three wickets came from poor deliveries.,9
"Holy shit, what a yorker.",9
Bumrah has been tonked by other teams. RCB just panicked hard,-3
like sending a middle order batsman who specializes at rotation and odd boundaries 7 and then expecting him to hit from ball 1 has ever worked,3
In before SKY demolishes RCB in the second innings,8
[deleted],5
[deleted],4
Madlad Gurkeerat has the same strike rate of 100 in tests ODIs and T20s,18
"What a peach!
Even though Sundar played it,he himself was unsure if he survived and turned back to see his stumps.",5
"Well, I guess I should be glad we've at least crossed 150.",3
I don't think that India's death over batting will be any different than what we're seeing from RCB today.,8
Boult has to nail his yorkers now.,2
Lmao that is some good running,3
"Washi has no bat sponsor ?


Capitalism is broken",2
That fucking rcb chants when they're struggling to reach 160 lmfao,3
RCB middle order rivalling SRH’s rn,9
This is actually good for RCB.,6
Twitter is down in india,5
Damn if Bumrah would have got a fifer he would have also got into the t20 squad.,8
[deleted],2
Chahal and Morris pls save us,3
"No guys, that's what the fielders are there for, right? So that batsmen can aim shots at them.",7
Ffs hit or get out .I want to see Steyn bat,5
loving these indian soap opera-style shots of koach and ABD,7
"Just realized, RCB is no better than SRH in middle order dept. They have been masked by Padikkal, Kohli, AB playing at top.",10
We are going to get absolutely destroyed aren't we,7
"RCB were all set for 180+, then

RCB happened",7
"Imagine a bowling attack Umesh, Unadkat, Dinda, Negi and Dan Christian. No such thing as a safe score",3
Gurkeerat legend,5
It was better when Gurkeerat made no contribution. This is in negative,9
I am a big Koach fan but today we will lose and he will be the reason :),1
These idiots are not even trying to hit boundaries.,5
Gurkeerat is so shit.,6
"Bumrah at 4-1-14-3, I missed these kinds of stats from him. Reminds me of his test stats from 2019",8
"Can see it in the RCB dugout, they have already lost the match.",4
Wtf is Gurkeerat doing,5
"Wait and watch, India is gonna play Washi at number 7 lol",6
Hope Kolhi is thinking about how he ruined the momentum of the game with his terrible batting..,7
Anything below 160 would guarantee an MI win. Can't see RCB restricting them.,5
Tushar played better yesterday Gurkeerat doesn't give anything batting like a Tailender. He's also a mediocre Fielder.,7
[removed],15
Omg Philippe is literally a kid Steve Smith,10
"Reminder: Gurkeerat is playing as a batsman!

Like what the actual fuck!!",2
RCB doing KXIP stuff.,5
Siraj need to take a hat trick in his first over else this will end in 17 overs,8
"Gurkeerat, man... better bowl sizzling tonight to justify your existence..",3
Gurkeerat is a fucking joke of a batsman. Dude at least try to hit,4
[deleted],7
[deleted],25
"Give my man washy a bat sponsor, he shows more intent that all the Batsman",12
RCB are 20 runs under par.,9
[deleted],16
Wtf were you doing till now Thalakeerat,29
If we get De cock straight away... It can be interesting... Let's see,13
Gurkeerat apology thread??,6
It's still a good wicket to bat on. Boult is still getting carted all over the park. Really good 13-17 over span from MI.,9
Yes Maaannnn,5
Send in Chahal cowards.,6
Boult channeling his Kiwi super over energy.,30
160!,5
"Ok 160+ achieved. Seriously though, when he is poor, Boult is very poor",15
Reminder that RCB lost to CSK. So did we but that doesn’t count,6
Boult gets leaky in the death,7
Honestly rcb are still dependent on ABD and Kohli even after all this year's. Only Padikkal has performed well other than those two,14
Boult is overrated,-3
Boult is not a death bowler,19
That’s the difference between boult and bumrah,16
"If Vijay shankar was 3d, Gurkeerat is 0.3D",25
Boult really needs to work on those yorkers. That slot ball ain't gonna do it.,10
MI will win in last 3 balls.,8
"Thanks Gurkeerat for giving at least a semblance of decency to the score, although it's still a disappointing total after the start we had.",10
At least we got 160,6
[deleted],20
Time for Lord Siraj to skittle Mumbai,5
We memed gurkeerat into form in just a matter of seconds.,9
"ngl boult should bowl 4 overs straight at the beginning.

He's not good at the death",7
yes keep up the reverse jinxing boys,10
165 to win! Any predictions lads?,3
Bumrah single handedly dragged this total below 170.,51
"MI fan here... With this score the match is on... RCB fans, breath now...",8
Well some valuable runs in the last over.,6
Boult keeps missing the mark in death overs.,7
Looks above par on this pich and rcb has bowling to defend,1
Rcb being considerate by giving batting to every batsman. Hope MI do the same :),10
Boult conceding 13 runs to tailenders is embarrassing,4
Boult at the death is such a liability,7
With this MI batting line up rcb are just short by 87 odd runs,5
[removed],4
We gave 5-7 runs more than we should’ve but will win so it’s ok,4
Why Boult bowling poorly in death overs?,3
30 runs short. Dismal batting,5
Below Par^TM,5
Dube does not do shit for the team when they really need it .,7
Is Tiwary the weak spot in MI lineup,3
They will chase it down in the 18th over,6
"Theoretically defendable, but we will need to get QdK early. And Ishan. And SKY, and Pandya, and Pandya, and Pollard

Yeah no this ain't happening lol",27
"76-5 in last 10 lvers for RCB

Compare that to 88-1 in first 10....",6
164 is a decent score overall. Need to bowl well!,3
"Kohli and RCB promoted Gurkeerat at 3 vs KKR to give him batting time, only to bat him below Dube and Morris in the very first opportunity lol",2
Any chance of us being able to defend this?,3
"If rcb can restrict Mumbai in the Powerplay, they will have a big chance",5
bowl Boult out before the 18th over please!,3
By God they got to the 165 target. Harsha I'm sorry for doubting you,8
The entire MI team should bow down to Bumrah in the dressing room.,7
"88/1 - first innings

76/5 - second innings",9
"If RCB lose this one, see you guys in the IND-AUS series",5
"Bowling master class please RCB, please bowl well",5
RCB atleast 20 short here. They have to bowl out of their skins to defend this against MIs batting.,7
"Got to say, underwhelming total from RCB. DeKock is going to OP them.",3
Now I really understand why Kohli tuk tuk in middle overs.,10
our bowling lineup scares me,8
This total has to be Waaaaay below par right?,3
We don't have middle order.  Playing sensibly to get 180+ score is much better than trying to score 200 +,5
Fuckers stole my momentum. Can't have shit in Abu Dhabi.,7
Boult is not a good death bowler. Ignoring it will bite us in the ass in a crucial match. Malinga even in his declining years is a better death bowler.,2
We are losing this one but the good news is there won't be a drastic effect on nrr,7
Padikkal should volunteerily get released from this shitty team so that he can join a better franchise,6
"Mumbai is chasing this down easily. Even without Polly and Hardik, they'd easily get this",6
Projected scores at one point were in the 200s man,2
"Does NZ have good death bowlers other than Boult who looks to be losing his touch? 

Ferguson is an option but any others?",1
We're gonna lose this in the 17th over by 8 wickets.,4
Bumrah just wrecked RCB,7
Boult bowling length and in the slot at the death is peak Boult.,7
Expected RCB to score 190-200 at 10 over mark. Excellent comeback. Batsmen are in good form. Should be able to chase this down ideally if  MI don't lose more than 2 in the PP.,5
"At least Mumbai have shown exactly what needs to be done on this pitch, bowl bouncers!",5
Yeah Pollard is going to take a nice nap now. He doesn't even need to pad up.,11
"If IK and QDK bat like they always do, this should be over in 15 overs",8
Is there any changes in the pitch from rr match or it's just about poor batting?,3
"Polly over pulled it by 20

N boom boom over by 20

200 looked well within reach with 130 in 15 n Ab at crease.",5
~~George~~ Washington to RCB:  “It is better to be alone than in bad company.”,3
MI will be desperately hoping for Rohit Sharma to get fit so that they can release Saurabh Tiwary back into the wild where he can forage for berries and catch fish in streams.,27
Mumbai win by 6 wickets in the 19th over,7
huh. I thought they would reach 200 easy.,2
"You know, I felt happy that we made it to 165. I mean, this is a total that a good bowling line up should be able to defend..then I remembered that we have the lord on our side",3
[deleted],4
Can we declare the win for MI right now? Don't want to get my hopes up thinking the wicket will slow down like I thought it would against CSK.,2
Predictions anyone??,1
165 is too much to chase for MI IMO.,-1
Lord Siraj economy predictions?,3
Seeing Mumbai's bowling. Remembers our Fragile batting unit *Chuckles we are in Danger*,3
Every side other than Mumbai is terrible.,2
"Good last over but still short by 10-15 runs atleast and Mumbai bat deep. 

Good comeback by Bumrah and Pollard. Bumrah is a fucking insane bowler.",10
"10 under par, will take a serious bowling effort against this line up. Pollard and Hardik have been way too good this season so even just early wickets won't be enough",1
"Mohammed Siraj and dale steyn could swing the ball early and shatter the MI batting, I am feeling today we wont win",2
Expected RCB to score 190-200 at 10 over mark. Excellent comeback. Batsmen are in good form. Should be able to chase this down ideally if  MI don't lose more than 2 in the PP.,15
Hot take: 100 all out here,3
I'll play Shabhaz ahead of Gurkeerat atleast he will bowl some overs & is a brilliant fileder can hack some runs also.,4
"Srh wants mi to win right, or does it even matter",7
"Koach  makes a team with 4 batsmen


Team collapses after 4 wickets


Koach: [...........](https://i.imgur.com/AITuXIA.jpg)",12
"Even if MI have the RCB kind of collapse in powerplay itself, they can still easily chase it. Gg bois",11
"Bumrah's figures today is as good as it gets for a pace bowler in T20 cricket. The pitch didn't look like it had demons. and considering that, it is even more impressive",11
This one is all on Koach.,7
"I keep on being hopeful about rcbs middle order, and I'm again reminded of why I'm such an idiot",15
Siraj needs to be in a destructive mode today for us to win,7
"My god, send a top order batsmen out to play at 6 and then shit on him for not hitting every ball for 6.

That’s a super specialized role and there are maybe 3-4 Indian batsmen capable of playing it well. Gurkeerat did pretty well all things considered",10
[deleted],27
"DALE STEYN INCOOOOOMING!!!!!

^^#excited",5
"As much as this is hard to grasp, I think RCB's hopes rest on Siraj. I don't expect much from Steyn and most of the others, except Washy and Chahal. So the only unpredictable bowler is Siraj here. If Siraj has a good day like that game where he won MoM, RCB win. If not, MI to win somewhere between 16.3-17.3",7
"I dont get why teams keep players like jadhav and gurkeerat to bat deep incase of a collapse and then not go all out in the middle overs 

They are clearly not power hitters and are forced to come late and swing at every ball",6
Guys no one is hating Koach but the way he is playing fans like me are disappointed because over the years he and AB were the only constant run scorers and finally we are having a good 11 and everyone is contributing but Koach is failing and that's what disappointing :),20
Unpopular opinion : virat can only play when there are early wickets. He can't come immediately and keep the run rate constant,7
Can anyone do the math which causes DC to come second?,4
"RCB have an amazing seam attack with Siraj Steyn and Morris, This looks tricky for MI. Hopefully they play well.",2
Boult is a rich man's (motabhai) Southee when it comes to death bowing.,8
English teachers fuming at Krunal’s “telled that”,20
"Best bowling sides this tournament by runs conceded:

1. SRH (1,856)

2. KKR (1,897)

3. RCB (1,906)

4. MI (1,926)

5. CSK (1,950)

6. KXIP (2,003)

7. DC (2,008)

8. RR (2,106)",8
Aaron Finch never played Josh Phillipe in England series. Hmmm.... Wonder why?,10
Murali Karthik on commentary seems like a VIVA instructor.. well prepared with standard questions.,3
I just hope our batsmen come out with INTENT,2
Am I deaf or did bhogle just say we have a deep batting lineup while talking to Krunal Pandya?,6
"Gurkeerat isnt a finisher, using him there is the same IQ decision RCB made with having Mandeep as a finisher and then saying he failed.",9
Unless Steyn winds back the clock big time RCB gonna have a tough day out.,10
"Abd got out to a fulltoss by pollard. I repeat, **a fulltoss by pollard**",25
MI fans leave the reverse jinxing to us. This is easily a chance for MI to increase their already untouchable nrr and qualify,5
Scenes if Siraj and Steyn bowl like each other,5
We’ll chase this with our endless batting,10
Watch SKY and Kishan take MI home.,8
"BC Kohli won’t hit Krunal but would hit Bumrah!

Of course, that was gonna work!

Learn how to hit the worst bowlers from Dhoni, that’s one thing he does well!!",23
All RCB hopes on Siraj now...to not do anything adventurous,15
"Bumrah has been quite exposed at the beginning of the tournament and always a shit bowler in important matches for India, teams should have seriously learnt a thing or two on how to smash him, you can't keep always thinking he's Bumrah let's respect him.",-21
"Kohli needs to look at Warner's knock yesterday and give up this ""anchoring"" role. Just play your natural game from over 1 and stop trying to ""accelerate"" once your set.",26
Hope saurabh tiwari smashes a 50 today,8
MI will chase this down like a piece of cake. Easily with at least 3 overs to spare,11
"Why does RCB have such godforsaken luck. We have an amazing opening partnership, padikkal was doing so well and then everyone else just shit the bed, this at a situation which was supposed to be good for Kohli and AB. F man F.",33
Sundar is a must in PP against the two lefties opening to avoid a flyer. Then Chahal has to work his magic in the middle overs.,18
another 10 wicket win for Mumbai?,6
"Imagine this scenario: Rohit and Saurabh tiwary in crease, 3 runs to win last ball, but couldn't pull it to the boundary",6
Lord Siraj or KKR Siraj today?,9
I know it looked bad for rcb in the end. But they got genuinely bumrahed. Did well to make runs of the other bowlers.,13
Bumrah is fucking op,11
We NEED vintage Steyn today!,14
This reverse-jinxing and unnecessary pessimism from every fanbase on this sub is annoying as fuck. Stop doing all of this and say what you're thinking for fuck's sake.,19
In 2018 umesh took 2 wickets in first 2 balls of the innings and Mumbai still scored 200,11
"It's a decent batting pitch as shown by Philippe and DDP. What followed was a mix of shit batting from RCB's middle order and an amazing bowling effort from MI. MI never do the former, and RCB are incapable of the latter so the game is over",13
They need to open with Siraj instead of keeping him for middle overs,9
If Mumbai can't win this it'll be embarrassing,4
Pollard's action in slow motion looks pure fast bolwer af. If he just had pace to go with his terrifying frame he would have been the best allrounder ever.,5
[deleted],-9
Pollard getting Abd out is the definition of shit gets wickets,16
Game Changer of the match- Lord Siraj either way.,11
"SKY is not happy with Kohli for Australia team selection, he will go berserk.",14
Wtf they actually dropped Australian captain for Australian reserve player,14
Inb4 SKY smashes a blistering knock to mock the selectors,7
Mumbai’s game to lose,3
I remember kohli got out THE SAME way last year against bumrah,10
Why doesn't Bumrah get five-wicket hauls ever? It's really frustrating. Mark of the best vs good bowlers is how many five-wicket bags they get. Bumrah is still one of the best but it would be good to see him get five in an innings.,2
in last game vs rcb Pollard scored 60*(24),11
"We should stick with Philippe and Paddikal, they can easily bat till the 10th-12th over before Kohli and ABD come in, which allows them all to play their natural games.",10
"Kohli will face heat from the bois he kept out of the LOI squad. Can't help it. SKY today, Pant vs DC. Wait n watch.",2
90-10 in favor of MI,5
"In almost every other thread you see supporters reverse jinxing their teams saying 'its gonna be tough to win this' and so on

But MI fans are just genuinely confident which is a pretty admirable display of the faith that this team has inspired in their fans",13
"If Mumbai chase it in 18.4 overs or less, RCB will return the favour to DC and go third",20
"Is it true that MI fans are thinking that RCB can win with their bowling ?

Or they are just trolling us :(",11
Siraj getting QdK or going for 55? I don't think there's much in between,15
So annoying to hear superV instead of virat or kohli or the way r/cricket knows him .. koach.,13
Match over in the 17th over? Or will they fancy themselves within 15th over? Let's see,2
20 runs short interview loading,11
"Again, people are saying for kohli to play his “natural game” it’s easier said than done. When the middle order is trash he can’t play his “natural game” coming in at over 5 and he defknetly won’t be able to finish the game.

Likewise, abd can’t bat through the innings either. If Virat and abd get out playing their “natural game” who is gonna save the team, it’s a team sport after all",7
Siraj 4 wickets minimum,5
Hope MI chase this in 18.5 overs so RCB stay at 2,4
"It’s really astonishing with all the think tank in the world, teams opt to hit the best bowler of the opposition when getting out can hurt them so much at that point in the match. 

Hetmyer: Rashid first ball I am gonna go!

Kohli: Bumrah over! I am gonna go!!

Get a brain you dumb fucks!",11
"Date - Oct 5th 1999

Him - No, let's not. That name is so common. Let's name him Washington. 

She - surprised pickachu face",100
"Udana should've played instead of Steyn. Even if Steyn plays well, there's a fundamental problem- there's only one death bowler, Morris. With no Saini from the other end, who bowls? Siraj? Steyn? Dube? It doesn't add up",24
"If Bumrah can get 3 wickets here, then surely that means an incoming Lord Siraj 4-0-54-0",18
What a great comeback from Mumbai! Koach and ABD were unable to perform today even though DDP and Phillippe showed that the pitch hasn't slowed down as much as it has been hyped to have slowed down,1
*Normies (MI) fight for the top spot to get two chances to go to final. Me and my homies (RCB and DD) compete for third spot to advance into eliminator*,15
Mumbai has been consistently making 190ish in Abu Dhabi so they should be able to chase this.,4
Early wickets or RCB are done with in PP itself.,2
Krunal hasn't batted much this season but he's a solid af fifth bowler. He has almost never been expensive this season. With Hardik bowling missing its been really good for MI.,3
Saini got injured at a pretty bad time,6
Inb4 Steyn 43 and Siraj 54,10
Incoming Lord Siraj double hat-trick? I don't see us winning this otherwise,5
"Speaking of that ad, where can I watch Hindi dubbed Takeshi's Castle online?

Had fun watching it as a kid.",4
Paddikal is getting emerging player award right?,9
"Look at Siraj's face

He's ready to take 10-7",9
Gurkeerat should be on the pitch if virat gets out quickly and should play the same role virat plays. They can have the big hitters at the other end.,2
Mumbai 165/0 in 18.4 overs,5
Kohli's fuckin dense. He played Krunal out and then tried to take Bumrah on.,8
Kohli should use Siraj as Deepak Chahar is used,2
"If Mumbai get out for -91, DC will go second. 

Or if Mumbai chase it in 18.4 overs or less.",6
"If MI wins this match, who has the easier route to qualification? RCB playing SRH and DC or DC playing MI and RCB?",2

There won't be any double maidens today big boi...,1

RCB is one of the few teams which plays without common sense frequently,8
Please show us some *MiyaMagic™️* today Lord Siraj,6
Space time and MI batting order is infinite how can wickets help if you have soo much goddamn match winners :(,4
Open with washy you cowards,1
"I cannot tell you how little chance we have here, 
We scored 200 last time took 3 wickets in the powerplay and still couldnt defend it.",8
We literally have 4 players capable of taking a wicket in the first over but just one to do that in the last.,8
Would mi go for win or would they bat sensibly first to avoid any Nrr damage due to collapse??,3
It's the same person opening either end,10
RCB will jinx again this season and DC and SRH will make the playoffs.,2
Does anybody else from Telugu states think that the guy from MPL ad looks like bhitiri sathi,3
OPEN WITH SIRAJ FFS,3
"Every other team: Sponsored by cement companies

seeing kohli struggling against average spin is worrisome. Indian batsman have no clue against swing/leg spin for some reason. Older generation were incredible against spin but had trouble with pace,4
RCB should have started with Siraj and Sundar...,2

Translation: just watch the movie!",7
Go MI. Sky should kill it today hope selectors are watching,3
It’s Mumbai’s game to lose even if the pitch isn’t easy to play on after the PP. Their batting lineup is too good not to chase anything below 180 here. Though of course RCB can win if they show commitment in the field and bowl well.,4
"On a serious note, anyone here worried/feel inferior that kids much younger than you are earning money and fame?",6
i have a feeling that this match is gonna have a really close finish.,2
Is anyone else feeling they're getting distracted by IPL. Usually I like to watch test cricket while multitasking but for the last month I think I'm getting really addicted.,13
Open with Steyn and Siraj and use Morris in the death when Steyn and Siraj both go to shit and we actually need Morris... Ffs how hard can it be,3
Why is AB keeping even though Phillipe is there? Maybe Kohli discusses stuff with him?,4
Is de Kock out yet?,3
“Fast keeper’s hands”,2
Why is no one talking about Kohli's poor IPL?,3
If Polly comes in at 3 match will be over in 15 overs,1

"Looking at RCBs batting thru this IPL, the biggest weakness seems to be the anaemic batting in the middle overs and a lack of a genuine finisher in the final few. And we haven't even CHASED big scores, the two times we looked at 200ish targets (against KXIP and DD) we screwed the pooch during the chase. 

Maybe AB at 3 and Koach at 4 with PP coming in place of Dube/Mann brings a better balance. Hard to see how else we'll make the playoffs else.

The KKR game aside, the bowling doesn't look like it can defend 165 w/o a Lord Siraj level special performance and that ain't happening again.",4
148 kmph and dispatched,4
"Guys, I’m firing my advisor (emotionally abusive). I’m struggling to hit send on the email. Some motivation from my friends here ?",2
Steyn has to physically scare de Kock like he once did. I don't think RCB can win through just playing cricket,5
Wth is kohli doing? Why would you not bowl Sundar in the pp against 2 left handers? Should've opened with Steyn and Sundar..,4
No way kishan will be selected for Indian team of accumulators,5

Ishan throwing the Kishan sink was so obvious. Still hurts I couldn't get in there first.,14
Steyn gun? More like steyn gives run 😭,9
Kishan loves RCB,6
we saving siraj for death bowling? lmao,4
How’s this a fair match Rcb have 11 players whereas Mi have 14(including umpires),3
Washington Sundar is the PP bowler Steyn wishes he was.,1
One bad ball per over continues....,7
"Kishan, one of the few Indian players that can pull off that hairstyle",6
I really hope styen will do well atleast for this match. Feeling bad for him,4
mi hitting atleast 1 boundary every over,6
"Shouts of ""Action!"" at the stump mike proves that IPL indeed does follow a script",9
"Any rcb fans still watching this?

How the hell do you guys still have hope",20
Ironically kishan has been playing more aggressively and consistently than Pant,8
"Siraj: does well with the new ball

Koach: gotta save him for the death then",19
Bowl a bouncer man!,2
147.5 KPH!!!,3
Why must rcb play with my heart like this?,6
Why even play Siraj if you're not going to use him up top? Weird captaincy,9
Has a team ever had all overseas from a single country?,5
Just checked and Kohli still has a 50+ average this IPL season. So I don't know why I still feel his performances are a bit underwhelming 😕😕,8
Dube has the worst running technique ever,3
Don’t know why I am watching this when RCB fans have given up lol.,4
It's still a mystery to me how Samson is hanging in there on top on the sixes leaderboard lmao,4
This the intent that will make a match out of this....,2
Give Dube an over. He’ll bowl slow,2
why not open with Siraj and Sundar. Both are powerplay specialists and two left handers on the crease. Also why is ABD keeping and not Phillipe? RCB really suck at management,4
"""Dats de Kock for you"" 


LOL",5
Isn’t siraj a new ball bowler,6
I still cant believe how RCB are in top 2 with this shit pace attack,-4
"I know Steyn is awesome and all 

But seriously when was the last time he had a great IPL season ?",3
Have a feeling Brett Lee doesn't like Steyn. Might be some history but personally Steyn has better Test record in India that's all matters ❤️,2
"Again, remind me. Why is Saini dropped?",2
they gonna chase this with 10 wickets left lmao,2
"Why pick a fast bowler if you cant bowl him in 1st 6? re: Siraj. 


He is not a good death bowler. But its one of those Koach tactics, that has lost him so many games so what do I know...",4
Only a miracle can save Rcb from this match. Really disappointed to see RCB batting like this.,4
"He still has the speed, idk why he isn't bowling well",4
Steyn is RCBs weed dealer,9
"Dube is one of the guys that looks super athletic, but yea, just that

He could pass of as Tapori Henry Cavill",6
SA Bowler to SA Batsman and SA Keeper.,10
"Regardless of what he bowls, 146 at this age is pure madness",17
"I've seen this on several occasions now, when a throw comes in from the deep Kohli fucking runs in and intercepts the throw before it reaches the bowler/keeper, like bro wtf you don't even trust them to do that much now?",11
Why is bishop raging? Yes we know you meant virats options..,6
146.5kph...still got it,8
Steyn to be taken by CSK next season,13
"Why RCB fans are watching this? -No

Why MI fans are still watching this?-Yes

Do you still think MI can lose this?",5
Man where is the timing,3
Fucking play tuk tuk yall playing dale,5
Danny Morrison: That's DE KOCK for you AAWWWWW YEEEAAAHHHHH,7
Steyn is still a beauty to watch.,3
Good to see Steyn hasn't lost his pace even after so many injuries.,2
Smoked!,2
Siraj got 3 for 8 here with the new ball last time he played here. Koach is braindead to not bowl him. But I fear another3 wicket haul by the Lord,19
Steyn bowling at 146.5km/hr at the age of 37. Legend!,25
"South African connection in the middle between the keeper, batsman and the bowler.",7
QDK really wanted to hit Steyn for a big one,6
If there are no wickets in this powerplay rcb have absolutely no chance,12
Mumbai are hitting a boundary every over without fail,8
One bad ball per over is really a thing innit,13
The bat speed,3
Nice Kock bro👏🏽,7
Steyn 😣,2
TV rcbd,2
Lol They are saving siraj for death overs,7
De Kock and Indian De Kock opening is so fun,8
Is this guy ishnan kishan ever played for india ?seems good why he never got selected,4
"Dont get the point of selecting Steyn over Udana

Steyn is quite predictable and one dimensional",7
we are so fucked,6
Steyns IPL career ended?,3
Styne vs De kock.  Anyone remembers when Styne scared DeKock with his reaction after a wicket when they were playing for SA.,6
Fuck off RCB.,5
Should be a cruise for MI. RCB were 20 runs short if not more. All they need is to capitalise on one loose ball per over and it’s easy. So I wonder whether they’ll push for the NRR to try and cement their place in the top 2,3
Dale 10 run an over Steyn,8
MI must be kock-a-hoop with this start.,3
Big de kock energy,3
"I hate the fact that RCB doesn't have good finishers,this is a big chink in the armory",6
Quinny with absolutely 0 respect for the greatest bowler his country has ever produced,14
"Man, steyn seems like such a shadow of his former super dominant self 😭",2
Siraj is gonna bowl all 4 in the death isn't he? Fml,12
LOL why are you guys saving Siraj overs? At the death?,3
Never a bowl a bouncer to De Kock on the legs. Outside off bouncer is what you want!,1
"Virat's brain:  ""We were 20 runs short"" and ""This is not club cricket"" are both good options right now. IPL is easy bro",2
"So is CRED all about shitting on every 90s icon ever?  
  
Also, despite the age and bags of extra weight Govinda dances fairly decently",9
It's sad to see Steyn like this. Even more than Dhoni.,3
Dale Homelander Steyn,6
Has anyone ever seen DeKock's forearms ? Why does he always wear full sleeves ? Is he a cyborg and hiding his bionic arms ?,8
Love the western union ad on Sky Sports. Oh he's doing exactly the cricket thing you're supposed to do.,1
Danny (again): de Kock got suckered into pulling himself,1
I really think Rafael Nadal is posing as Steyn to play some cricket here. No other explanation for the shit bowling but great hair. RCB sponsors must have done it to get more marketing,3
"Philippe given only 2 chances and dropped. Parthiv never played. Gurkeerat, Washington, Dube and Moeen messed around in the middle order so they never got stability. Fast bowlers rotated. Steyn not given enough chances and rotations for Saini and Siraj",2
I don't mind losing the match but at least come close.  Make it interesting. Where are the script writers.,10
Have MI ever had a batting collapse? Asking for a friend.,11
sundar is bowling beautifully,2
If anyone is still surprised by Kohli's big brained strategies then you haven't paid any attention to cricket in last few years.,4
"RCB not having good finishers is gonna hurt them in the playoffs, RCB invested too much on the top 4 but now they don't have finishers to back them up",6
I’m watching because I’m also hoping MI takes it deep to atleast have our net run rates stay above DC’s.,2
"please QDK don't throw wicket to spinners, especially don't try those switch hit",2
"Lmao MI, RCB and DC are desperately trying to avoid finishing 3rd and likely having to play KXIP in the knockout match.

DC especially seems to be in really poor form recently.

KXIP with Universe Boss has been a totally different team. Brought some damn mojo to that team.",7
atleast let mumbai bat till the end if we cant win,2
"Steyn's been over the hill for quite a while now, should retire. That being said, I think if he gets a short haircut his bowling might improve.",5
I think RCB now should try with Siraj. I guess this is the same pitch where he performed exceptionally brilliant.,3
"I guess virat could have thrown the ball to siraj, this match is already out of RCB's hand",5
Does MI ever play defensively?,5
Fucking casual in the deep man,3
Sundar bowling Sundar. Also good intent👍🏽,5
Anyone can relate still watching this with dead eyes and no emotion,7
Qdk wanting to send the ball to Capestown.,4
Parthiv Patel would be a lot lot lot better option than Gurkeerat. Wonder why hasn't he played. He should have been traded off.,5
This is going to be another one sided game.,2
Well that fielder was chilling,1
Koach konfuses me sometimes,2
The lack of variety in RCB's pace lineup is concerning,3
Koach is interested in civic beautification. He wants to make Washington sundar again.,9
Calm down quinny. Ffs play him out,1
No boundary in this over,1
"So (Kishan,de kock) >>>> (Rohit,de kock)",5
"Honestly tired of ranting, but why hasn't Siraj bowled yet? I just can't think of any reason.",9
"Is RCB the biggest contender from
The IPL to go on a Chicago Cubs like 108 year title drought?",8
What's the least no of matches lost by a team in a season?,3
"Siraj bowled an incredible spell opening the bowling against KKR, and Sundar did a great job last time against MI opening the bowling, he came late in the PP today. This is braindead captaincy",9
Iyer makes stupid decisions- fucking braindead captaincy            Kohli making stupid decisions- fucking bowlers,8
One good over and he will get Siraj in to compensate for that. Smh,2
And now they bowl Siraj when the ball stops moving,6
With Phillips on the team shouldn't rcb have him keep wickets and have abd in the field.. he can def save a few runs and take a stunner or two.. sorry if this was discussed earlier.,6
Random question: Is Jaiswal's career over?,1
Here comes the game changer!!,1
How are spinners like sundar and axar so economical in pp? why is it hard to smack them?,1
RR and batting order 🤝 RCB and bowling changes,8
Rcb too has a bowling cheat code — Chad Chahal.,5
Lord is here,2
Come on Siraj man... off one of these guys....,3
Fuck you Koach and your brain-dead decisions,6
"lmfao, wtf happened to steyn's barber?",4
Miya ready ho jao!,4
"Siraj almost strikes with his first ball

A true lord",6
"The secret to bowling at 145+ like Steyn in your late thirties? Look no further than,-

Sextillion7thPower",24
"Siraj ripped through KKR batsmen with the new ball. Why wasn't he given the new ball tonight, when it was needed the most?",7
Siraj has great hair,7
"Bowling Siraj to Hardik would be a huge mistake, wo gond tod dega. Saying it as a MI fan.",9
Steyn's speeds show he can still do the job at the highest level. He just needs to play regularly. Not just a few games here and there in PSL and MSL.,6
First ball. Lord raising his arms in expectation.,3
"Koach: Don't worry boys. If we take 2-3 wickets we can expose their fragile middle ord.... 

*self realisation hits

Koach: Oh sh*t",8
Why is ABD keeping? After today's innings I am pretty sure Josh will play at least 3 more games for RCB,4
Chotu kishan is gonna blow today,2
De Kock is going painfuly slow. WIll come back to bite Mi in the ass.,1
"Started playing among us, Can't find decent players to play with :/",2
"I think Koach has been over-depending on these matchups. Sundar against lefthanders, etc. Nothing else can explain the baffling decision.",1
Lo aa gaya rcb tumhara siraj,13
Lord,8
"In before Kohli doesn’t bowl Chahar because left handers on the crease. Also, revives PTSD from the Delhi against KKR!",8
Fuck yes siraaaaaj,4
In Siraj we trust,8
Siraj the Savior,8
Siraj OP,5
This is Siraj’s ground.,8
THE LORD DOES IT AGAIN,9
Lord siraj,5
Lord Sirajjj!! Back at it!,3
*LORD SIRAJ STRIKES*,3
"Although Ishan finds it difficult to rotate Strike, he is a great runner between the wickets. Love the dive he puts in.",5
"If Siraj can do that to a set batsman, imagine him bowling the first over. Lordy",8
Lord Siraj strikes !!,5
Yaaaas Siraj!,3
That is why you should give Siraj the new ball,4
Yes boys lesgoooo,2
Siraaaaj,2
Miyamagic Bois,4
Sirajjjjj,3
LORD SIRAAAJ!!!,3
SIRAJ OP,4

SIRAJ GETS DE COCK oh Lord,7
"Match is still ON 
RCB fans are just trynaa jinx it",6
Lord is back,3
In b4 Siraj 3-8,6
was waiting for the bc mention,2
"Get in, Lord Siraj!",2
Lord has returned,3
Kohli sure loves ben stokes,10
Siraj make love with me,11
One shot too many,2
"If Siraj can do that to a set batsman, imagine him bowling the first over. Lordy",11
Looks like Siraj has evolved,11
Lord Siraj at it again... We are fucked...  :((,10
"Love it or hate it, Kohli is one hell of a hype-man.",12
Siraj is bowling like a god,6
This is the only moment of joy for us rcb fans,7
SIRAJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ FUCK YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,9
Ben Stokes being invoked here.,9
"> Siraj getting QdK or going for 55? I don't think there's much in between

Posted that half an hour ago. Boom.",11
Oh lord my lord,6
NAWAB SIRAJ-UD-DAULA IN DA HOUSE,11
9D chess by MI to make sure Siraj is selected in playoffs,9
"Still should have given him the 2nd over :'| 

He'll get thrashed later.",6
We call him Lord unironically,9
Lord siraj it is,3
"De Kock flicks Steyn for 6

De Kock gets out trying to flick Siraj for 6

Siraj > Steyn. Facts don't lie",8
SIRAJ STRIKES!!,4
Why were they withholding Siraj so far.....,6
"If Siraj gets another wicket in this over, game on.",8
Ben Stokes!!!,2
Huge Wicket! Rest of the middle order did not even get selected for Indian XI /s.,6
Steyn makes me want to look to Siraj for hope,1
Lord slays de Kock. #Mirzapur,2
LORD,2
Atleast we got to see Koach all fired up!!,3
Koach. Curse how much you want but please not at De Kock. How can someone curse DeKock.,6
"**5.3** Mohammed Siraj to de Kock, OUT, de Kock looks to repeat the shot he played to Steyn last over. The pull to a length ball, but Siraj doesn't offer him the high pace he got from Steyn. Ends up toe-ending it to the deep midwicket. Siraj can do no wrong these days **37-1**

Q de Kock c Gurkeerat Singh b Mohammed Siraj 18 (19b 0x4 1x6) SR: 94.73",2
I swear to god if kohli gives him the ball in the 17th and he goes for 30..... I will be sad,15
Qdk played 18(19) in POWERPLAY why no one shitting on him,9
[deleted],16
"Oof. Looks like QDK has come back to Earth after a few great games.

Let's go Ishan Kishan! Your name is dumb as shit, but carry us to victory!",-6
Heard Ben Stokes name being said 5 times after the wicket,40
"Win or lose , love Kohli's reaction for every wicket !",12
"If MI have Bumrah, RCB have Siraj",18
I genuinely believe SKY is not in the Indian team because he shaved at a wrong time...,11
How tf did Siraj become good?,4
I almost came,5
Never though I would place all of Rcbs hopes on Siraj,10
Get sky or kishan plsssss,2
"Virat Kohli : "" Come on BC! You Siraj haters yes he's gonna play the Adelaide test now what BEN STOKES YA BOIIII """,9
Sky and ishan itstime to blow up,1
"that feeling when you survive Steyn, Morris and Sundar and get out to Shitraj...",2
Wide but good carry.,2
Harsha: de Kock was looking good..... ;),3
Moral victory by already doing better than csk vs mi match with that wicket,9
"Do we like using Lord Siraj both ironically and unironically, or do we need Nohit / Brohit names?",4
This pitch and Siraj. Well Can we see the 'siraj' of KKR match,2
[removed],3
Ohh fuck we need to protect Morris.,12
Chainsaws in the dugout!,2
Kohli is so hyped love it,3
Slowass outfield,2
Morris is going to injure himself. He is trying really hard!,5
You know Siraj is a legend because there's already a Sir in his name.,16
Chris Morris is looking a little uneasy right now. Hope he is okay.,9
Sky and kishan ANGRY mode for team selection.,8
Sun Boy Yadav,3
Morris has been struggling for a while,3
Shot,2
SKY looks in such good touch . U fair he didn’t get a chance in any of the white ball squads,7
Its over for MI now,2
"I know people hate Kohli for this but I love him for the exact thing

Celebrate everything for the team regardless of your performance",15
no morris no,6
God Morris don't injure yourself for one run,10
"Oh no, Morris.",7
Is the pitch getting sluggish,3
Siraj is back among the runs,2
"Lord with a wicket and a wide and a boundary in a single over.

Entertainment package.",9
sky beast mode today,4
Hope SKY plays till atleast 14th over he will play Chahal/Sundar well,3
Kohli is so loud lmao,8
Last 2 balls of Siraj over gone bad,4
A boundary cutting exactly between the two fielders >>> a 6.,14
Is the outfield relatively slow today? Seeing a lot of shots being dragged back in this innings alone,5
Choking now and ending up 5th would be peak RCB.,19
Is injury loading for Morris? Please no God..:(,5
Just 7 more wickets and we win boys 😂🤣,8
Fight my team.. c'mon,9
Kohlis aggression  is fun in India games. not against MI boi. Don't,14
"What’s everyone’s ranking of the cred ads? Mine goes Anil Kapoor, Govinda, Madhuri, Alka-Udit, Bappi in that order.",3

"Jack Daniels ad : *yeets phone* I always wanted to do that

Next day : homeless and Jobless",5
Prayer circle for Morris pls no injury,7
Washi needs wickets now,5
ffs get kishan out atleast. Idc if we lose,1
It would have been better if SKY opened,0
SKY is what India needs in their t20 squad. He can hit it out of the park with brutal force or hold the innings and still maintain SR over 120/130 with good strokes.,6
"Slightly off topic
How is Mirzapur series guys?",7
He threw the Kishan sink at that one was a damn good pun,6
"Atleast give some fight

That's what I expect",5
"If Morris cannot bowl his 3 overs than the match is finished for sure, RCB does not have a 6th bowler",7
"mf we lost, i dont know why i got so excited just for a single wicket",9
Guys is Morris ok??????,4
"There is Bumrah and Rabada celebrate like, ""Hmm, nothing new."" 
Then there is Siraj...",13
[deleted],12
Siraj and Steyn brothers up there with the economy.,6
"*Ishan Kishan places the ball through the gap to the boundary*

Swann: He threw the kitchen sink at that",5
Glad the stupid “ask the experts” question got called for what it is. Finally.,9
RCB fans worried that RCB may end up finishing 5th                   DD- Allow us to introduce ourselves,21
SKY is scoring a 50 today.,4
Question to MI fans- When was the last time MI had a collapse and Pollard didn't saved their ass?,8
I hate Ishan Kishan so much,9
"Rohit with that expression seems like he knows the end of his international career is approaching if lads like Surya, Kishan and Paddikal keep on batting like this",10
Why is Pant being pitched against other Indian wk performances when clearly now KL is the LOI wk first choice for India? KL should be the benchmark now.,14
Damn whats with kohli being so angry on field. Calm down,0
Sundar controlling amazingly.,10
"At least for Delhi, win toss and bat first is the only option. If the other team win the toss, hope that they choose to chase.",3
"RCB are truly blessed

They have Morris, the greatest bowler of our generation and some bloke called Dale Steyn as their seamers",17

Shitty fielding,2
The stat is wrong . Iyer won the toss yesterday and lost.,6
Just play out sundar and we good,5
surely a mandatory chahal wicket soon?,7
Why is Kohli called biscuit?!?,4
Mumbai Indians being 49-1 is a subtle reference to the time RCB were 49-10,9
[deleted],3
Sundar 9 dots in 18 balls.,5
Fuck... We're winning this at any cost.,6
Tunak tunak makes its way to IPL lmao.,6
Sundar has built up the pressure.. now koach should bowl chahal and get the wickets,7
It’s Chahal time lads,7
"RCB ‘S’ bowlers: Steyn, Siraj, Saini, Sundar",6
Please bring the SKY down,1
I am hoping for a dramatic collapse from mumbai is that too much of an ask?,5
This is typical RCb get fans hopes high and then lose the game. So just chillax MI fans.,6
Has Morris gone off the field?,4
Why does Kohli keep intercepting throws from the deep?,9
The game on a knifes edge here,3
"Bhogle going like a typical Bollywood heroine in 90s movie, playing with flower petals: ""He loves me, he loves me not"".

Except with ""they'll take a run, they won't take a run""",10
Harsha Bhogle is a national treasure,13
Chahal is either gonna get a boundary and a wicket or nothing,9
we need mi to win only after 18.4 overs to keep 2nd spot,9
I still can’t wrap my head around the president of BCCI promoting a gambling app.,32
MI will lose this,0
Hey there rcb fans let sky score just for selection,5
"washi's already bowled 3 overs, MI still has a chance ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",7
Rahul Dravid's Car Dekho ad is nightmare for introverts like me 😭😂😭😂,15

why can't Indians hit spinners anymore,7

I guess a wicket is  comming now,12
"It seems like Kohli always gets particularly impressed by any player  who plays well against his team. Buying the whole KKR bowling line-up being one of the countless examples. So, youngsters should target playing well against RCB especially to have their way to the Indian team.",14

I thought Inzy had come back after retirement,7
It is amazing how often Chahal's flighted wide outside off stump works.,5
Saurabh Tiwari playing a slow innings is the last hope for us now :),6
Bruh MI pls what is this yaaar,2
"RCBs shit bowling lineup is aided by long boundary, they would get fucked in India",-4
Surya's innings is the make or break for MI.,7
tiwari needs to play his usual knock. He's been an underrated player this season tbh,9
I love how you can always hear Kohli after RCB take a wicket,2
Some cricket fan on Cricbuzz totally jinxed Kishan. They had published a comment praising his batting just a couple of deliveries ago.,3
Oh lawd,2
"what's up with beards and shaving this ipl, every other match some player is coming beardless / clean shave",4
"*My Grandpa half sleeped just uttered*: "" Saurabh Tiwary is in team to make Rohit feel he's not really that Fat.""",9
RCB and KXIP both showing fight in their every game. This is the best IPL,3
How is RCB 66%? What even is that?,3
Any excuse to give Dale a big hug.,3
ABD jealous of Virat giving attention to Steyn,6
Those odds are the wrong way around,1
End rant,1
hardik de kock kishan bumrah boult steyn,3
27 ball 23 followed by 35 ball 43 incoming by Tiwary,2
Oh fuck nonononono,5
"lol Chahal is now injured, RCB just cannot win.",6
Saurabh 'Teddy Bear' Tiwari incoming.,2
"Last night I watched breakfast with champions Chahal episode again, this dude is so genuine",7
MI only with 34 percent of chance to win,3
Chahal injured?! Ugghhhhhhhhh,2
"Nah fuck off don't tell me Chahal's injured

Kinda want us to win the LOIs vs Australia",8
Budget inzamam ul haq,5
Did Steyn just say I'm going to be a father? Why was koach so happy?,3
Don't give us hope guys. This match is done. 9.28 rrr is unfuckupable for MI middle order.,5
Fuck me the spin choke is on.,3
Bruh chahal and morris injured?,7
"*""You don't wanna ball any buffett to him""*

Swann throwing some shade on my boy Tiwary.",8
Cookie discussing Tiwary's physique on TMS is amazing,2
Chahal looks in some pain,6
Shit we cannot afford Chahal getting injured,3
Is Tiwari fit?,1
Chal n morris injured. Good luck to our death overs,4
"Morris, sundar and chahal can cover 12 good overs with a good economy. Steyn and siraj will have to ball really tight. They are the ones who will leak runs",1
RCB keeping things in check while Steyn has the highest economy. That's a sentence I'd have laughed at in the preceding years,8
"Hotstar app so shit, i prefer looking just score in cricbuzz",3
Pollard and the Pandya fuckbois still to come,4
Game is in Mumbai’s favour 70-30. Ffs stop with this doomer bs,4
"what happened to chahal, nooooooooooooo :(",11
Easy two boys!,2
Players dead randomly.,7
"Saini injured, morris looked kinda uncomfortable and now chahal",5
BIG CHUNGUS TIME,1
Why has SkY started to look more and more like Hardik?,7
Specialist Fielder^TM Pawan Negi,3
R/fucknegi activity watch today?,5
"The match is RIP for us for sure if Chahal's injured, or if he can't grip the ball the way he wants to.",2
"Ah yes. Let's go the SRH route and pick up some injuries. First Saini, now Morris and Chahal seem to be having some issues",9
"Whenever Kohli celebrates, he looks a young kid finally getting his dream toy after begging his parents for a long time. Love his enthusiasm and celebrations..",12
Do it sky . Show kohli he made a mistake not picking u in any squad,5
"Fielding coach to players ...

Guys ..it's sand underneath ..dont dive.",2
"MI deserves to be champions this year. 
Pls dont start with even year bullshit guys.",0
No one expects the ~~Spanish~~ spin choke inquisition.,4
Sundar take a wicket also cmon,1
Who was shouting 'easy 2 boys'?,5
Fuck Hotstar,1
Well Chahal having problem in his bowling hand.,4
Oh god please don’t let anything happen to our lord and saviour Chahal.,6
Come back chahal pls,3
"Openers did the job for RCB. 


Let's see if middle order can finish it for MI",4
Dugout trying their best not to call tiwary a fat fuck,34
There’s no more spin after this over if Chahal is injured :(,3
Why is inzamam in MI blue?,9
"ok, Tiwary's cut out reminds me of Inzamam ul haq",1
Required runrate is never a problem for MI as long as they dont lose wickets quickly,6
"Nobody:

&#x200B;

AB: Catch it, Naise Washiiiiii",2
"Swaney: points to a random bald guy

hE lOoKs LiKe NaSsEr HuSsAiN",5
How many dots has Sundar bowled in the tournament so far?,4
Can anyone remind me the origins of r/FuckNegi?,3
[removed],1
Abid Bhamcerwala is the best name of all time,2
AB is super chatty behind the wickets. Is that good or bad?,1
[removed],4
Saurabh Tiwary looks like left handed Inzamam these days,5
"Sundar's done his job

4 cheap overs",8
Guys why is AB keeping and not Phillipe?,5
Chunky boi,1
[deleted],13
Watching Virat being proactive for every second on the field as the skipper and then I realize we've got a numb zombie in Shreyas. Doesn't fucking flinch at all.,13
[deleted],10
"Wait, why is AB keeping if they have Phillippe in the side?",12
I don’t have a good feeling about Siraj bowling in the death against hardik,16
Is the pitch dying?,2
Pls chahal be okay,7
My goodness looking at Tiwary it feels like we don’t really have any fitness standards at the IPL level,12
Kohli looks pissed. Everything is normal. We will survive 2020!,6
Washi being economic as ever,10
[deleted],4
Pawan Negi and Anukul Roy- Spidermen Pointing at each other,11
Pollard & Hardik to fuck it up for RCB today,11
[deleted],10
I think we need a couple of overs from dube here.,6
The bowling coach went straight to Siraj.,13
Zaheer Khan 😳,1
He's so Sundar 😍,3
"Sundar is gone, now smack (except chahal)",3
"We all know Graeme Swann has so many great fat jokes on Saurabh Tiwari, Alas this political correctness.",19
When you become a billionaire just to get hardik and de kock on the same team,55
"Looked up Tiwary to see who tf is he is, and wow did he age horriblly",5
Any update on Morris?,2
Brüh if MI bottles this with their fucking lmk batting lineup,1
Whew Yuzi back,8
What happened to Morris?,2
Hopefully Chahals gf can read what ball he bowls from the movement of his fingers,6
I miss Tiwari with Thala hair,2
Team rcb is extremely  aggressive and makes too much noise around batsman. Damn annoying,-2
Off topic: why is Lee called Binga?,3
"As long as these two are able to maintain a partnership, up until atleast the 12-13th overs our middle over can come in and finish the game",1
Is Morris Injured?,1
Need to make sure Tiwary wastes as many balls as possible and get Pollard out early,1
Taking a huge risk with Chahal. His finger looked very off in the closeup shots.,1
MI have the best middle order in ipl by miles. Almost 7 players are match winners with the bat,8
Bowl one over of Dube. Slow might work here,1
Why is Tiwari playing for singles 😂,3
"Mi took the ask to almost 10 per over, if the power hitter click no big deal for MI. Bht im liking the Kohlis captaincy woth slip and rotating the bowlers. I wish he played zampa instead of styne",4
I know we make fun of cricketers for being thicc and looking unfit. But damn Tiwary is proper fat. Not athlete at that level has an excuse.,14
Slog sweep for six? Hell yea,3
How did that travel jeez,4
Fuck we are done lol,7
Bruh SKY goti muh me aagye the ek second ke liye,3
SKY deserves a chance in the national team ffs,9
Gote muh me aa gaya tha,5
beautiful SKY,3
Suryakumar seems angry at being left out,4
"Lot of folks consider me toxic on these match threads.

Imagine animated Kohli on the field. Now just translate that to me watching the match. And there, you are not surprised anymore at what I do!",3
SKY showing Virat,4
[deleted],9
alright wrap it up,3
How do you not select this guy for T20Is?,9
Perfect time for big fuck you to the selectors right in front of Koach,5
AB sure does expect a catch on a well grounded shot,6
"Yeah Surya, show koach how fucking good you are.",5
Sky❤️❤️❤️,4
Kohli realising slowly that he is gonna be with Iyer or Pandey and not with SKY,10
Siraj steyen and morris left guys this is gonna be easy if you play out chahal,2
Dekh kohli dekh kohli. How good is sky,4
This is how MI plays no matter what situation is they try to hit the boundary,6
Better off doing everything possible to keep Tiwary on the field rather than get him out and face beasts like Pollard and Hardik,2
Tiwary reminds me of Guddu* from Mirzapur,6
Yea Fuck those selectors,7
"We're playing so goddamn slowly ....... goddamn guys, we're chasing a total here. Don't play so damn defensively. Especially with Tiwari out there ...... fat ass can't even run well to push runs.",-4
Sky purposely targeting yuzi too show how good I am,13
SKY proving his point right to the captain's face,8
SKY FLY,8
[deleted],13
Kohli is pissed af,12
"Forget international, but SKY should atleast get to play in India 'A' team.",3
SKY shaved? could barely recognize him,3
Sky bats soo fucking good,2
Who is the worst indian player of spin,3
Virat is being way too aggressive there. Uncalled for,9
SKY smacking their best bowler to prove his worth.,2
95 in 10 we got this bois,3
Why Virat is called koach?,4
Surya is like kohli is this the best you got?,4
75/1 in 10 overs would have been fine. But 70/2 not too bad either,3
kohli stopped the ball like “fuck you bitch tryna take a single on my watch fuck off bc”,4
Can feel the tension between Koach and SKY,11
Kohli be like - tu aayega team mein?,5
Last game they scored some 80 odd in 4 overs. 95 in last 10 is easy peasy. Game over😔,3
"If you were MI and could only retain one of Kishan or SKY, who would you go for? Considering the age difference as well.",2
How can sky and paddikal not make t20 squad?,1
"If Morris is injured then.....


WE HAVE DUBEY OVERS LETZ GOOOO",6
Cmon Siraj,3
Surya is in mood to mock national selectors.,6
SKY and Kohli got T E N S I O N,5
Aang and sokka ready to beat the fire lord,1
Banana boy Hardik lol,2
RCB needs a couple of wickets or this is going to be tough for them without Morris at the death.,2
Bish only said tracer and stopped. Didn't go the full ''tracer bullet'' out of respect for the big man.,3
we need to get sky and pollard out asap and just wish fucboi isnt in his zone today,3
Big over alert,4
Meme alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3
Bald Pandya eating bananas looks like a proper pujari.,10
Siraj has to try and break norm and not give many away here.,4
[deleted],7
Pretty boy Shivam went to the catholic church to take revenge of his childhood scars. He pulled up his teacher and said : My name is Dube and I won't need Lube...,9
"Can anyone hear what koach is chirping, scumy little cult leader",2
Out of the loop but anyone has seen Nadal Federer docu on discovery,4
Lord is back to give runs!!,2
"Everyone was talking about pant comeback , but Surya Kumar is doing it",2
What does a director of cricket do?,1
Just keep tiwary on strike,1
"Saurabh is so frustrating to watch, I used to love him in his initial days",1
Why is Virat so pissed?,4
"Used to hate dhoni for csk quota, now virat's doing the same with rcb.",5
Tiwari wtf,2
Virat Kohli needs to behave like a captain.. over the top celebration looks childish,1
Pandya eating a banana to build up protein for his 35 off 10 ball knock,11
Kohli be like - roadie banega tu? Haan ek chakka maarke hero ban raha hai?,7
"If Virat kept quiet for like 20 seconds, he'd catch the ball, throw it to the keeper and just think. Bizarre but might be the eighth wonder of the world if it happens",2
Tiwary will build pressure on SKY unfortunately,2
Why don't MI try Aditya Tare instead of Tiwary?,2
"People shitting on Tiwary, the guy runs pretty quickly",1
"Zak : comes on screen

Greame Smith : *aight imma head out*",5
Guess I’ll cry myself to sleep.,1
Yes Surya deserves to be part of T20 team without a doubt,3
Saurabh needs to start braking mid-pitch so as to not run off to the boundary,3
"Everyone was clapping there for Tiwary running 2, not for the fielding",5
No tiwari no,2
Siraj of all people is RCBs lead bowler,4
Woah 🔥 game,1
Quick two from Tiwary huh,2
Damn Lord,1
"MI looks weak without Rohit.
Their batting looks empty ngl.
After them only Pollard and Hardik are there,hope they don't fail tonight.
Pls don't say flair checks out.",2
Fuck nooooo,2
Lord Siraj.. Remember thy name.,2
Holy shit!! What a brilliant catch !!,7
That's a brilliant catch,6
"Loved how Kohli face palmed after he realised SKY's 6!

Yeah he's an awesome Batsman who does not play for RCB!,

Talent exists outside your team too!",-1
Tiwary is fast for someone his size.,8
That's padikkal bois,8
Siraj u beauty,2
GET SHIT ON!!!,3
DDP- Fine I will do it myself,8
Uhh that's the wrong person to get out,10
MI don't  bottle this,2
What a catch!,4
Devdutt why so handsome,7
I think Dube can bowl a quick over or two before Hardik / Polly arrives.,3
"Fuck

Shouldn't have taken that catch",14
DEV YOU BEUTU,2
"damn, tiwary can run",4
Fuckkkkkk why they got out Saurabh Tiwari that was our last chance :(,10
Mother of God!! Paddikal you flying Mallu!!,11
I think Sirahj gonna take another,8
What a catch,6
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT DDP,8
WTF DevD,6
Catch of the season,7
"You didnt have to get him out siraj, wrong move",4
Not the wicket we want.,3
WHAT A CATCH,6
"What was that innings, so bad. No intent",5
What a catch,2
That sounded like MI camp was fapping when Zaheer was speaking lol,4
BY THE BAREST OF MARGINS,2
"Bad move, RCB! Bad move!",9
Should send Krunal right now and save Hardik-Pollard for the death.,6
Paddikal is a star in making.,7
Good. Tiwari needed to go,2
How....DDP you beauty,11
That 2 took all the energy Tiwary had,4
What a catch.,5
No don't get him out!!!,5
Sky looks like an awesome player. I hope he makes it to the Indian team soon.,3
"Wow, just wow",6
[deleted],7
Why padikkal why? What did mi do to you?,2
Lmao at this rate DDP will get a national call before SKY,15
Siraj is doing bits,6
wow,3
Paddikal is a superstar!!,8
That might very well be the catch of the season,6
Wow!,1
"As 2020 will have it, Siraj to shut everyone up!

I won’t even complain, good for you lad! Go Siraj!!",5
Is there any beef between SKY and Koach or is it just speculation?,1
Pollard incoming right? :(,3
Wow what a catch DDP,6
What a catch!,4
SIRAJ MAN,4
that's an exceptional grab..,2
"Ye nahi karna tha

Shouldn't have got him out guys",2
Kind of shit gets your whole team pumped up.,2
Pant FC not doing well this IPL,4
"If MI lose this, they'll be the second team to be beaten by RCB twice in this IPL. 

First was KKR who got thumped by RCB in both matches : by 81 runs and then 8 wickets.",5
whataaa catch!,2
Tiwary's innings serving as a toilet break before the real action starts,11
"Siraj is love, Siraj is life.",2
Oh yes it's DDP,2
Wow Devdutt wow. That's just fabulous man.,3
This Padikkal catch should be in top 5 catches this season.,12
"**10.4** Mohammed Siraj to Tiwary, OUT, sensational catch at mid-off. Padikkal uses all his height to dive full-length and forward to send him back **72-3**

SS Tiwary c Padikkal b Mohammed Siraj 5 (8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 62.50",3
Padikkal is having a great fucking day. That effort should really light a fire under em. This is still a mountain to climb to pull this off but don't make it easy.,5
SIRAJ is going to wreak havoc in the tests in Australia. Mark my words.,10
"Padikkal Op 🔥

RCB! Win it for him. 🥺",5
That catch 0.0,2
Blessing in disguise . Hope they send pollard not krunal,6
What a bloody catch that was,8
Should have allowed Tiwary to eat up a few more balls,7
"Arey yaar isko thodi out karne ko kaha tha

T: Didn't tell you to get fat Rohit out",1
Kneel to to your Lord,7
"If rcb somehow get hardik before he does the damage, we can easily win this",7
Zaheer Khan looks more fit than Tiwary,10
No not tiwary man,2
Padikal stunner,5
What a fooking catch! Shame it was Tiwary and not Yadav...,8
Why did Dev catch that? Noooo,8
"Haha we just need to get SKY, Pollard, H Pandya, K Pandya and Pattinson out that's all. Might as well include Bumrah because you never know",15
"Still Krunal, Hardik and Pollard to come with SKY at the crease. Still Mumbai’s game",18
"Frankly, Tiwari getting out is a good thing. He's dogshit.

Now we can actually score runs.",8
Lmaoo Padikkal so tall and Virat so short he barely makes it to DDP’s shoulder when hugging him,11
that was beautiful but he was not the guy we wanted out of the crease,9
I think Krunal will come,5
"Still need to get 4 more wickets, man fuck this MI team",11
"Bowl fast Bowlers to counter Krunal!

Steyn next over please!!",5
"I want people to tease the f out of Krunal, like he does when he bowls.",7
Lord Siraj has awakened,5
"In couple of years or so if everything goes right for Paddikal, he will replace Dhawan as a left handed opener for India.",11
I want RCB bowlers to get wickets but then I see that Pollard and Pandya bros are yet to come....,9
Why can't we play Aditya Tare in place of Tiwari?,3
"via @sagarcasm on Twitter..

*Twitter is facing too many technical issues these days. Looks like they are employing coders from White Hat Junior. #TwitterDown*",40
Bhenchod what is wrong with siraj. How is he taking wickets this season,9
"No Hardik or Pollard yet? MI are throwing away the match like this, by increasing the RRR",5
C'mon Siraj give a 6,2
Siraj is fuckin unpredictable,13
Chahar has a resting bitch face even a mother wouldn't love.,3
"DDP looks like a class bat and a very good fielder, now quickly get out of RCB before that gets ruined.",4
Krunal would be my captain in the punchable faces 11,18
"This guy can add lot of value with his fielding as well for India in future if he keeps up with his batting talent. 

The big question is can he break into the strong top order of India with so many competing for that top 3. May be in 2 to 3 years.",2
Only with MI you can get away with sending Krunal before Hardik and Pollard. Any other team would get shit for such a decision,8
Katich looks so lonely when Hesson has gone inside to take a shit,8
Till Hardik and Pollard are to bat I won't count MI out.. any one of them can chase it single handedly,8
RCB - Takes stunning catches of other batsmen but drops straight and simple catch of Pollard and lose the match.,10
Kohli is being loud out there,5
Lord Krunal 🙏,1
Siraj is a staunch follower of the inflate - deflate strateji hence today's performance!,3
I miss the old Hardik Pandya.,1
That’s out!!,0
Krunal wtf,2
MI just want to get it to 70 off 6 and then go berserk,2
"This is still Mumbai's game with Krunal, Sky, Pandya, Pollard.",3
Damn MI just got DPed,3
A great bit of fielding always turns the tide. A mountain to climb for us now.,2
Thats the most gully cricket appeal if I've ever seen one,1
Krunals batting makes me cry.,1
Shot,1
Siraj is proving why he is picked for the big time dance.,3
the worst thing about this is RCB will keep giving us hopes of winning even tho we are def gonna lose,8
"Why the shit is Krunal up before Hardik or Pollard ....... terrible decision.

We need runs.",2
Yes kewnal hitt,1
Chahal goona take another wicket in this over.,1
"Usually the bowler is always certain it's out. With Virat as the captain, the bowler has to calm him down",7
KPandya gets paid more Bumrah FYI.,4
Shit looks like a difficult chase from here. At least Krunal will score more quickly than Tiwary though,3
[removed],3
"Saw Hardik having a meal, just couldn't resist noticing, threw his wicket... Saurabh Tiwary for you.",43
" MI don't mind losing wickets, every run is bonus before Pollard and Pandya",10
Siraj very clearly using a hard length and cross seamers to get the ball to stop or skid on. Good tactics tbh can not be pitching it up on here.,11
RCBs match to lose from now,4
"what do you think of the fast bowling so far?  
well…  
thanks for your time",7
Reverse Sweeps - *Innovative intensifies*,7
"Btw, Siraj is gonna be a damn joy to watch if he starts making the national team consistently. He looks rock solid as a bowler.",8
"Saurabh Tiwary is liability, how is he part of such a decorated line up",8
SKY jeeta dega aaj.,5
"I can't recall Krunal playing switch hit before, am I right?",4
Why not Hardik?,3
Why is Saini not playing today?,7
"So again, how did we come to dislike krunal for his attitude and like Hardik? Krunal was supposed to be the matured bada Bhai",23
[deleted],5
MI should win this with their batting lineup and RCB’s death bowling abilities,13
SKY exuding BDE,6
What was the auction price of Saini and Siraj?,3
Chahal pls go back,2
There’s no way MI is winning this surely.,2
Certified class shot,2
Mi's batting line-up just refuses to end and kkr has Nagarkoti coming at 5th down!,11
"SKY, You Beauty..😍😍",4
If MI wins this they are 99% qualified but not the same case with RCB.,5
Pure class. The selectors are blind.,7
SKY is proving why he should have been on the plan to Australia...,19
"Virat to chahal: Kya be gandu, kya ball tha",11
Selectors shaking,7
"SKY picking on the best bowler of Koach's side

Thats some good shit...",2
"SKY needs to go, man.....",-1
SKY is so good man. Best uncapped player in India.,8
I wouldn't be surprised if AbD starts advising Chahal how to bowl in Hindi.,5
don't like the the pace they're chasing atm tricky total this.,1
Just injure someone and take sky in the squad.,2
Stupid bowling to throw that up offside as the last ball.,2
If sky doesnt get out koach gonna be whipping himself later in his room in the night,3
Holy shit the Siraj buffs were permanent?,3
Sky targeting chahal in front of koach is the best thing today,5
"Man its just Kohli's karma always. Whoever isn't picked to Indian team, wil come and smash us all over",4
Let's go Skyyy,3
And they choose Six and Out over him smh,4
"Get inn SKY, bats like a dream, right in koach's face.",7
MI needs to speed up,2
want sky to play well today. A batsman who can play spin well is a rare occurance nowadays,6
"By the time MI plays final whole team will be clean shaven, probably bald too.",7
Yes SKY smash him in front of Kohli,5
"""Tu janta hai woh shot, toh fielder waha rakh lete""",3
It's sad to see Chahal getting smashed while defending.,4
Imagine not selecting this guy for T20s,4
Don't worry we're winning this,-1
Poor guy plays well every match and they select pant instead,1
SKY is one of the best players of spin in the world but selwctors won't even let him play a game for India,4
cant even ask to get sky out bc either thic or fucc are gonna come and annihilate our bowlers. Fuck MI,3
"I want RCB to win, but want SKY to beat the shit out of RCB bowlers in front of Kohli too.",3
Kohli unleashing a few Ben Stokes on Yuzi after getting hammered for 6s. Seems he hates SKY,1
SKY is so much better than IYER lol,5
Sky could honestly replace Kohli in the t20 squad,-2
"Good movie to finish Steyn now, rather than getting hammered in the death by Pollard & Hardik.",4
"With our indian top order stacked, you needed someone like SKY to hold the ground in middle overs. But no, don't pick him or whatever.",7
Keep calm and trust sky,8
Please Dale One wicket please,3
"All Dug Out Fans, if you look closely the pink line is where a Kilt would end on Scott Styris if he were wearing one. I don't think he ever wears underwear anyway because it is inefficient",1
Surya is like i will destroy all your best bowlers you still keeping me uncapped bitch.,13
"The fuck, SKY",5
That's the shot to play against chahal's wide leg break. Batsmen usually tries to play straight and gets out,1
79 in 48 is MI to lose. Best team so best bet it to try and take them to the last over so we can keep 2nd place,7
"Btw, is Udana injured?",1
Iyer for no.4 in ODIs and SKY for no.4 in T20s 🔥🙏,6
"I kinda miss watching KP using his feet to play vs spin, a lot of people forget footwork is key to counter spin",3
Lord Steyn atleast get one wicket ffs,4
KEEP GOING SKY!!!,2
"Sky is so getting a 50 today
On your face cap",3
SKY winning the game for MI would be a big fuck you to the selectors and Kohli,5
GET DUBE IN FFS,1
"Stop it, he's already dead",2
Dugout bar charts are peak /r/DataIsUgly,2
This is done for us,7
"Our batsmen are just so goddamn passive today. Taking too many dot balls and singles, instead of aiming for the gaps and running hard. And then they get tempted into hitting sixes and get out. 

We are chasing a decent total. Get runs or get out so Hardik/Pollard can come in and do work.",-2
fuck this is hot stuff from SKY,5
Yeah apparently Iyer and Pandey are better than him. Fuck off.,8
[deleted],1
Virat can easily leave Indian t20 team now I think ...,3
"Remember that scene in MS Dhoni movie where Dhoni starts tonking in front of the selector?? Yeah, SKY is doing that to Koach now.",8
Kohli should show respect to Bumrah. He just tries to own him everytime,5
what a stud SKY is,6
Sky to BCCI: suck on these,9
"SKY got swagger with that cool demeanour, casual bubble gum chewing and excellent shots.",8
What the fuck is this bowling?,4
Fuck SKY what a gem man!,3
"Fuck this shit, I’m gonna do some work or something",3
Sad to see Steyn like this,3
"Steyn is done. 

Still better than Umesh I suppose.",4
India's selectors are shit. Head selector has only played 3 matches for India lulz,7
"This is already done, isn't it.",7
No mercy from SKY,6
"Mumbai are still cruising, dunno why their fans are so worried whenever their team does anything apart from absolute domination. They’re the best and most balanced team, the RR game was just Stokes doing his thing.

Suryakumar looks in top form too.",7
"Damn, sad to see Dale Steyn bowl so poorly. Would rather have Umesh at this point",1
Surya is making it count when it matters,5
NOOOOO STEYN NOOOO fuck,2
Aesthetically pleasing Sky shots,5
"Okay MI, you can win this. But don't hit Steyn so much please",7
"Sadly, this might be the last ever IPL match for Dale Steyn.",6
It sad to see a legend go through this.,6
Sexy Sky🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺,8
Kohli getting pissed at every sky shot. WOW,5
Aur maar Surya selectors ki gaand faad deh.,8
"Dale steyn, bowl slower, pace doesn't work",2
Man Steyn sucks now. Just bowl 1 over of Dube,3
Man SKYs strokes are like butter.,4
Surya showing Kohli what he's missing out on.,4
Poor decision to get steyn back. braindead RTG from koach,2
[deleted],7
Loving the fact that SKY is so calm after hitting these boundaries. Kohli would be burning from within in wrath,7
"Well, you know what they say. 

SKY _is_ the limit after all",8
all the pressure gone in this over shitttt. Kohli should have brought Sirajj,2
[deleted],1
Hard to watch Steyn like this :(,6
"Yeah, the game is done and dusted. stop wishing for a wicket and just cry yourself to sleep tonight.",8
SKY showing Koach why he should have been picked for the Australian tour.,6
Wtfffff,3
Every time sky hits a boundary kohlis anger meter goes up a notch...  good for sky to prove he is better than the selection committee thinks he is. He definitely deserves a chance.,11
Is steyn okay? Wtf is he doing,2
"Da fuck, Steyn.....",2
Surya is schooling Steyn.,5
Wtf Steyn,4
What a shot surya bhai,5
That's so fucking classy,3
Surya over Iyer every single day of the year.,4
wtf why is steyn playing he is garbage,3
Can we borrow Bumrah for one over?,8
Steyn is such a punching bag lmfao,-5
Surya you beauty,4
This is how a response should be for not being selected instead of a sarcastic tweet,10
"Excellent SKY. Please give captaincy to Rohit please (after he gets fit). Also at least drop Sasthri,. Until that happens , SKY and Pant wont find a place.",0
I genuinely feel bad for Steyn now!,9
Sky ftw,2
"The selection brought this out of him

Not holding back any punches",5
Steyn getting hammered is making me miss Umesh Anna ngl 😂,2
Is it wrong to wish for mi to loose but SKY to perform extremely well?,0
Not sure why people here think Kohli selects the team.,6
Sky is smokimg mann!!!!,4
Terrible bowling. DC bowlers bowled similar lengths and got tonked,2
SKY starting to heat up! Let's go!,3
Yep we're done. We are missing Saini big time here. Where the fuck is Udana,2
Kohli scolding Steyn smh. One day Kohli will getting scolded by one of today’s kids.,4
WTF Sky,1
Siraj is unironically RCB's best bowler rn,7
Why is Steyn so effin useless,1
Steyn's become BJ Penn of cricket :(,4
I rather see Dube than Steyn now,4
No I am not crying nooooo I am not crying :(,4
"Too much South African vibes in RCB, gotta be careful or they're gonna choke",8
This is pure revenge batting from SKY,4
Steyn at his Prime was in DC. The original DC not the knock off DC that we have now,10
SKY for indian team,6
[deleted],2
"Bc Mc Kohli, Dube is a better bowler than Steyn. Ffs don't give Steyn another over.",1
"just realised, suryakumar’s donning the same facial hair as tewatia",4
"Why are RCB dropping in-form Udana, and replacing him with out-of-form Steyn?",11
Why is Isuru not playing? Steyn is a leaking tap,7
This is some serious trash from steyn,10
"That's the end of the match.

Thanks Steyn.",17
"Both legs in the air, damn",8
SKY pointing a huge elephant dick to the selectors,6
SKY going all out today is just what I wanted,5
Oh my god! Suryakumar! What class batting. He deserved to be atleast in the squad. I will say it as a DC fan. This man is more fluent than Iyer for sure.,9
Casually having chewing gum and smashing steyn,3
Got the wrong person out,2
Poor bowling by Steyn. Keeps bowling him same place.,1
Sad for Steyn but SO HAPPY FOR SKY,3
"Why the hell is SKY not considered for India T20 squad. he has been one of the more consistent batsman for KKR and MI over the years and has played multiple roles of a finisher and top order bat.

His attitude issues earlier on in his career should have definitely pissed off somebody higher up in BCCI.",5
They stared each other?,3
"Oooo staring contest, take him down SKY, he's gotten to big for indian cricket.",8
Fuck off this guy deserves to be in the T20 team. Selectors 0 IQ,7
Still wondering why TF KKR let SKY go??,6
[deleted],10
"Udana honestly would’ve been more effective than Steyn, and he can bat",6
surya from don no.1 in the middle.,3
Many pure cricketing shots SKY you beauty,3
Fucking Koach. RIP RCB.,7
SKY Kohli staredown. Lmao. Even the cameramen know what to focus on,10
"Had SKY been in RCB, he would have been selected for team India. Change my mind.",7
Just casually smacking South Africa's greatest bowler,6
SKYs shots are Eye candies and dagger to the heart 💔,7
Sky ensuring that he is never selected in the team by bashing Kohli’s team.,9
Are they having a stare off? Kohli and Surya?,9
You grow up watching and idolizing this guy destroying the Indian lineup on a flat pitch like Ahmedabad and then you see him suffer against a Ranji player.,5
Umesh we know it's you now take off that Steyn mask,9
"Steyn is so past his prime. Don't see him playing next season.

&#x200B;

Good that RCB gave him a game, really special bowler back in his heyday,",5
SKY should be dropped for that soul patch,3
Omg SKY staring Kohli downnnn,13
Both sky and kohli trying to assert their dominance over each other,7
Don't know why koach is shaking his head. He hasn't been batting too well either in most games.,4
"Really, what more does SKY need to get into the India T20 squad",5
That's gonna leave a Stain.,5
SKY asking questions to BCCI with that knock?!,6
SKY not afraid of staring back,12
why is Steyn playing in T20? He is not suited for that.,1
Kids nowadays really not gonna know what a champ Steyn used to be 😭,11
Tunuk tunuk. Insta reels. Lol,9
Steyn so poor,5
Kohli and SKY just had a stare off,12
Udana at least took wickets,8
"Children: Kya Plan hai
Legends (Shyamgopal Bajaj): plan kya hai ?",2
Were sky and Kohli having a staring contest?,24
"once again brain dead selection by kohli, rcb is a shit team that is in top4 solely on the basis of few individual performances by AB and one from virat and siraj each.",5
LOL. SKY ignoring Kohli,26
And why is Saini not playing?,2
Lol the walk away!!,7
"Been a fan of Surya Kumar for 3 years now. Everytime he is on song, it almost feels like there's no legit way to get him out. One of his flaws is that he gets out in real innocuous ways. 

That being said, only a head filled with sand would ignore him for T20 national team.",13
Steyn circlejerk can stop now. The guys a bowling machine now who just gives batting practice,2
Ppl saying ddp should be in t20 team during his first ipl.. sky should have already been in the team based on all his ipl performances,6
oh that bollywood-esque stare down,3
Dale Steyn looks like elder brother of Sam Curran,0
"Staring contest between Koach and Sky. Looks like they don't like each other. Go on Surya, bring him more misery for not picking you.",27
Not an MI fan but God do I want SKY to score the winning runs tonight,14
"Damn, something's cooking between Koach and SKY.",17
Take fucking Wickets for god sake,4
Fucking cheap kohli,10
Kohli is a cunt. Plain and simple,17
Honestly I don’t agree with all the sky hype. He needs to be a bit more consistent only then he can get a place. All these people y’all are trashing like iyer pandey etc they’ve also had blistering seasons in the past,5
"SKY is never getting in the Indian team for sure, isn't he?",37
"For real, India are missing out on SKY's brilliance in Australia by not picking him.",9
~~Kingfisher~~ more like Cringefisher,5
Fuck off Kohli,11
SKY is just so pleasing to watch ❤️,10
press F for RCB,4
Gully Cricket tactics from Koach,8
SKY is a man on a mission here. Loved the stare off there.,7
Hahahahaha kohli with some peak Australia form right there,8
SKY to Kohli:🖕🖕🖕🖕,9
SKY just dealing in boundaries now,2
We might get to hear some spicy selection comments post match if SKY finishes this off.,2
"Sky even fields brilliantly, what do selectors even want more? Koach supposed to love fit batsmen who field well",4
Damnn I am enjoying this,4
"Afraid, the game might be over. Next up are Pollard-Hardik.",3
Fuck them Sky!!!,4
Kaleen bhaiya and Tommy Shelby like stare off between SKY and Kohli,3
Simon Katich looks like Joe from Impractical Jokers.,3
Bas kar SKY 😠,2
As rcb fan smash all over sky,3
woah! serious drama between SKY & Kohli! oh yeah! i like this bloke! fuck kohli for his unwanted aggression.,7
"thanks kohli, now I’m rooting even harder for suryakumar",7
Fucking SKY I like you but please,2
Suryakumar is here for vengeance. Fuck Indian selectors for riling him up,7
"If chahal doesnt get a wicket or two, there is not even hope to get the game to the last over",1
Koach had to go and rough up SKY,1
FUCK EM UP SKY!!,3
This SKY guys is ice cold,4
Kohli feeling insecure in SKY's presence,3
"If surya was in any another team than mumbal he would have been selected.

Rift Confirmed.",6
" Cmon sky, tear Chahal a new one",1
SKY  with balls of steel.,6
This is the first time that I'm witnessing Kohli actively avoid eye contact with the batsmen when hes fielding.,4
Sky trying to mess our nrr,4
What more do selectors want from SKY :'(,6
is kohli abusing surya kumar? looks like so !,10
Not a good idea to get him angry now koach,2
"Hahha you beauty, if this is where SKY's career turns around , thanks koach.",3
SKY playing a ‘Fuck you for not selecting me’ innings,9
"With all due respect, Steyn is trash now.",6
"What a statement to send out to the Indian captain lmao

SKY is gonna make bank next auction IF MI doesn't retain him",6
"Rcb fans, blame this on koach and selectors for overlooking our man.",7
if SKY was in CSK he'd already have played 50 LOIs by now,10
Surya don't want any beef with Koach,5
What is going on between kohli and sky guys?? Who started it,2
Gonna need Morris to pull a Bumrah,3
SKY's taken his opportunity to show Kohli what he's missing perfectly,5
I’ve never seen Kohli sledge someone in an ipl match,3
Does Kohli have a say in team selection?,11
Krunal chutiya,5
They had to announce the squads for australia tour before this match. Lit a fire in SKY,7
Imagine Dhoni doing similar shit.,2
Aaaaa unnecessary,1
SKY saying fuck you to Kohli,7
MORRIS UR SHOULDER STOP CEĹEBRATING,4
Fuck the selectors for not picking SKY.. now we have to pay for your sin,7
SKY has owned Chahal today,2
"I remember SKY as the hard hitting finisher, then he went to KKR and came back, now he is an ideal number 4.",6
Totally fucking unnecessary shot that. Krunal you dumbfuck,6
r/Cricket whining about Udana being useless and wanting him to be replaced with Steyn and now shiting on one of the greatest bowlers of this generation.,15
Kohli has no class.. this is cringy coming from one of the most followed athletes in the world,8
"Why SKY, why were you never this good during your KKR days??",5
Either there's some bad blood between Koach and SKY or that's some excellent cinematography to show a narrative,15
Hardik's on his way to take revenge for Krunal,9
https://media.tenor.com/images/ac341992b64ea710ec33f2a881a3eec2/tenor.gif,1
"Now watch kohli, he acts like he finna win that trophy hahaha 🤣",11
Mistake. Fuccboi will just end this sooner,9
How the fuck captain of Indian team and the best cricketer we have is trying to sledge an uncapped Indian young batsman. Absolutely shameful,22
Wtf krunal wtf,4
Can SKY play at No.5? I think the major reason he's not selected is due to him being Top order player,3
I would rather have Krunal in than Hardik,7
Even VK wouldn’t be surprised if RCB loses remainder of the matches and crashes out of ipl,3
Ok until now I was rooting for RCB but now Im rooting for Suryakumar to win it for MI because Koach is being a total dick.,14
Pandya time,2
Atleast krunal is showing intent,4
Steyn retire,1
Kohli off the field seems like a nice person but a massive twat on the field.,13
"Chahal, we wanted to get rid of SKY not Krunal",3
I think krunal was thinking of last two balls from chahal as free hits,7
Please Hardik...not today,7
I get why most non-Indians hate Kohli. He acts so much like a wanker and you notice it when you're not supporting his team.,14
"Kohli : I only can stare at you because I don't want to make headlines tomorrow


Sky : Bitch I can only stare, because I still want to make it to the team.",16
Jokes on RCB. Krunal was sent there to hit. Now bros from the hood will step in,9
Krunal man that was completely unnecessary,4
Kohli sledging SKY is extremely  low from captain,24
"one more wicket, chahal, please. get this fuccboi out, please please",3
Why Koach? If you can't support your youngsters don't fucking do that. Save that for Smudge and Warner,10
RCB have to get Hardik and Pollard out ASAP or this is dusted for em,3
No guys we can't win this only a miracle can save us,3
Need a hatrick,2
 SKY needs to get out or this is over with 2-3 overs to spare,2
Ugh i absolutely hate kohli's reactions,10
Not a bad wicket to lose given spinners quota is over,3
If SKY was in RCB or CSK he would have played bunch of international matches by now,12
oh it’s hardik “remember the name” pandya,5
Hardik I appreciate your services but I don’t need it today,8
"SKY and Harddick...Game will be over in next 2 overs, either ways....",1
Sky got some guts hah. Special vs koach. Damn love that guy,9
"**13.5** Chahal to KH Pandya, OUT, Chahal gets another batsman with a wide slow legbreak. Unlike Yadav, Krunal Pandya looks to clear long-off. This doesn't turn back, and takes the toe end for a catch to long-off **107-4**

KH Pandya c Morris b Chahal 10 (10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",1
Dumb from Krunal when SKY is going on from the other end just take singles. Putting undue pressure back on him,4
Jo bhi karne ka... kohli ka ego nahi hurt karne ka.. ( do whatever but don't hurt kohlis ego) I wonder if this staring contest between sky and kohli will make skys selection in the team even harder. Select on talent please...,3
"Steyn bowls like he doesn't care at all.. idk what has gotten into him.. he was so much better last season..

not a gun bowler anymore, trying too many things..",9
Just imagine exept varun every kkr player just gets hulk level angry for not in t20 team and just blasting tommorrow??!?!?!?!?! : 0,6
Virat's childlike enthusiasm is really endearing!,2
"Sky, Hardik and Pollard.....bye bye 2 points",14
Lol,1
Ngl but kohli perfectly looked like a chimpanzee when he was shown celebrating in slow mo,18
[deleted],9
"If you want to show aggression on the field, you gotta do it like David Warner yesterday.

This from Kohli looks embarrassing, particularly on the back off a 9(14).",35
"the only reason SKY isn't in the Indian team is coz he can't play dots like Kohli and ""anchor"" the innings",11
What's Kohli been doing?,3
"Think i missed, did Kohli sledge Sky?",3
"Wtf Krunal. Completely unnecessary. 

WinViz drops from 69 to 60 for Mumbai.",1
"Hardik:Aaj mei mere bhai ka badla lunga!!

AAJA KOHLIYYA!!",0
"Scores 10(10). 

Fans: Atleast he played with intent. 

_Sure_",2
SKY the only player to stand upto Koach after Gambhir. MASSIVE respect!,6
I missed the Koach fracas. What happened exactly?,2
Sky will hit the winning shot while staring at kohli.,1
"Still winnable, but imo, we messed it up a bit by putting in Krunal instead of Hardik or Pollard.

SKY bailed us out by smashing Steyn that one over, but still got a long way to go.",4
SKY isn’t in the Indian team because he is from camp Rohit and not camp Kohli.,10
I absolutely love koach's reactions,3
"Well that was shitty from Kohli

SKY's day today",4
"That was dumb from Krunal, bad match awarenes..",4
"To be honest Suryakumar's domestic One day average is 35 in almost 100 games and his IPL average is 28 after almost 100 games, strike rate is okay in both case 99 and 134 respectively. But now at the age of 30 he's in form of his life, now how long can it stay is other thing, India surely should've given him a go.",15
This Mumbai team should canter to the title. None of the other teams look like they can even compete against them.,7
Hardik can you just not be Hardik today,10
rip,2
Is it wrong that I absolutely love Danny Morrison on the comms,3
Dumb shot just when they looked to be back in control.,7
58 from 37 they are going to cruise to victory with 2 overs to spare lmao,6
Tbh now even if MI loses idc but kohli s losing so much respect rn,7
"Don't shake koach's hand at the end, whatever happens on the field stays on the field is a great cop out, he acts like a little goon even for the national team, never a gracious winner/looser.",6
Oh yesss Morris is bowling,2
some hindi dubbed south indian movie level stare down between those two.,13
Our poor last 5 overs are gonna bite us in the ass,8
Koach should have ideally saved a couple of overs from chahal to bowl to hardik and Pollard.. but he had no choice I guess given SKY was smashing everyone,4
6 overs left and Chahal bowls out his 4 overs. Kaptaincy!,8
"Cricbuzz straight up described it as ""brainless cricket from Krunal Pandya"" lol",11
There was no sense for krunal to bat for singles with pollard and hardik to follow. He had to hit out or get out and he did that,6
Krunal Pandya baffles me,8
So you just seriously can't like him as a bloke. End of story,12
few more tattoos and praising kohli/shastri in interviews is what SKY needs to get into the team,7
I hope RCB stop chopping and changing the team too much. The side is not settled.,5
"Only a miracle wins us this. Maybe one of hardik or Polly doesn't fire, but one will and SKY is set",10
What will they do with the remaining over of Steyn? Will Steyn bowl or will Dube bowl?,2
Jeez even the commentators want Kohli to calm down.,0
Can't wait for Kohli to give his signed bat to sky and fuck r/cricket,11
Kohli se dushmani karega to national side main kaise ayega?,-1
"SKY to kohli: ""Select shit, get banged""",7
"If only Rohit TO lead the national team , SKY Would definitely get a place.",8
Koach has saved two overs of Siraj for the death.,7
Nobody gets the 666 huh?,1
MI has such a gun team.....,3
"So, 58/36 is doable, but not a gimme.

Gonna need a classic Hardik to close this match. He's got Polly behind him, so should be able to be aggressive here!

This is why I really wish we played NCN instead of Pattinson ........ allows us to bat deeper.

Pattinson sucks.",3
Still need about 50 runs from 6 overs,1
"What is wrong with RCB, looks like everyone is stressed in RCB camp",3
Pandya giving death stare to moris. We are in danger.,10
[kohli everytime after bowler gets wicket](https://ibb.co/xXm25Pz),6
Bumrah was the difference in today's match. Otherwise it would have been close,9
Mumbai is the only team where after getting a batsman out you are more afraid of the batsman coming in next.,12
Rcb gonna win this match by 10 runs,0
"Looking at Surya's batting, its unfortunate he was not picked for T20 team. He has an easy way of batting and ability to score at will. I rate him higher than Iyer or Pandey when it comes to T20 batting.",5
[removed],8
well to be fair we were bowling pies that day,5
Pandu bros aise kaise chalega,3
"Say what you want about virat, but he's the kinda cuntish player you'd absolutely LOVE to have play for your team",1
"morris got fuccboi angry, fuck",7
SKY should try anchoring all the way to the end and let Hardik + Pollard accelerate.,3
Boys we don't need Intent right now just play safe,5
I am pretty sure the selection committee is independent from the captain,6
Aaj Hardik karke aaya hai ki nahi?,8
"fuckin shit credit to MI this is a solid af team, no weaklinks, except krunal",3
Big hit alert,1
MI will win this match even if it goes to super over,4
Selectors must be patting each other on the back for picking Pandey ahead of Sky for T20s.,14
what can two quick wickets do to the game at this stage?,3
It was stupid of SKY to stare Kohli. He should ignore these silly things and focus on making it to the Indian team. That doesn't mean you have to be like Jadhav,3
"DONT LET PANDYA HIT ON THE LEG SIDE  

E:  I said it here first",4
I’m convinced neither RCB nor India will ever win a trophy as long Koach is the captain. Mans gotta mind of his own. Even a mediocre captain would’ve won us the World Cup last year with the team we had. But no had to send Hardik at no 4.,6
"This should be sushi, pasta or pizza walk for MI.",5
"Why are ppl describing Krunal shot as braindead/ unnecessary? I think the intent was right, the execution didnt come off. With firing Pandya and Pollard in the bank, it doesnt make sense to keep Krunal till the end.


He had a clear purpose.",13
Thats how kohli plays. Thats how he is on the field. Idk whats wrong with it. People here commenting as if he's stopping sky from batting.,8
Fuckin pandya often fucks up in pressure situations.,3
Shot,2
One ball and look what happens. The margin to get ur ass whooped is unbelievable,4
Damn every MI player shows INTENT🥺🥺🥺🥺👍🏽,10
Someone’s gonna get hurt in Australia and SKY will be called in as replacement. Save this tweet.,3
"Imagine sky, hardik and Pollard getting out to a hat-trick. One can only hope..",7
"RemindME! 20 minutes ""reply to this thread.""",1
yeah lolhli scream now na,1
[deleted],10
"There was a fielder there, the audacity of him",2
Dicks out for Hardik,2
Here we go boys,2
We DONT WANT YOUR SERVICE HARDIK,6
"Hardik & Pollard. Terrifying. Total is too less, and one over of Steyn still to go",3
Seems we are blocking even links to gifs,2
Wow we didn't lose it in 15 overs.,3
Ffs stop bowling half volleys,2
Krunal hits first ball for 4(4) and HardDick does a 6(4),5
When you finally realise that Paine was right about Kohli,-2
MI is the only team with Indian in its name,-6
VVS Pandya.,4
Really wished Rohit had better attitude towards fitness.,5
"That's my boy,good hit Hardik",2
never make the fuccboi angry,4
CSK you know what to do,1
RCB bowlers bowl easy boundary giving ball every 3 balls.,3
man KLPD can get into test squad on IPL performances but SKY can't even get into T20 squad,12
"Hope Kohli takes it positively, stare down by SKY",7
"Holy shit, Chahal is fast!",2
Okay only a miracle can save RCB today,11
Kohli's arrogance is really annoying,2
So indian thala vs england thala tommorrow,8
chahal should switch from the steady diet of chewing gum to some real food,8
Obligatory Morris pie after 3 good balls *check*,1
Some test match leaving from pandya there can someone explain?,2
Can someone tell me what Kohli did? I missed it,4
[deleted],13
Yes sledge hardik lol,2
Good leave,2
"RCB haven't learnt from the last match, keep bowling pace when the pitch is slow",5
Plz sky score a 50 and point the bat to koach,5
At this point RCB were 130/2 with ABD and Dev still in :/,7
48 off 5 overs. This is MI's game to win.,5
"SKY is so good, how was he not selected",3
Hardik to Krunal(probably) : Don't worry onee-chan. I'll handle this one.,4
Kohli's more of an obsessed rather than passionate I guess,3
Oh no...,1
There was someone in this thread saying that kohli should play mindgames by sledging sky for not getting selected lmao. Predicted the future,2
Really hope SKY wins this match and stays not out at the end.,8
"*Morris trying to dominate Pandya by throwing ball at him*



Pandya doing the Ben Stokes Pleasentries so Morris understands 😂😂",5
I don't feel so good Mr. Koach,2
"If RCB get two more wickets they are back in the game. Even then I’m sure that one of Polly, Hardik or Sky could win the game singlehandedly with the tail sticking around",2
Will anybody be surprised if either DC or RCB get knocked out?,2
Lord siraj,1
YESSSS,1
Whats worse is that SKY doesn't even get picked for india A. No chance for him in team India over paddikal,5
50 for SKY!,3
What a knock SKY,3
so much meme content we're missing here due to fuckin copyrights on cricket videos and gifs.,7
Harlun,2
is a half volley and a yorker the same thing?,2
Yeah Surya. Show them what they're missing.,3
FIFTY FOR SKY 👑,5
"That is a good ""fuck you"" 50 from Sky.",6
"Did our bowlers even look at what MI bowlers did? Jeez, at least try a slow bouncer FFS",7
Brilliant 50,3
I have full confidence in SKY to take MI home.,7
"on one end, set sky with fueling anger and on the other end the harddick",2
What a 50.. come on buddy.. show your bat to Koach!,7
"I love that Siraj is performing well and all, but can anyone explain me how? Because others call him a red ball bowler, how is he doing good in t20 then?",2
SKY to BCCI and Kohli rn: SUCK MY SCHLONG....,11
SKY didn't celebrate.. hmmm.,7
Jesus christ Dube lol,4
Jesus Christavarthy,7
Would we see vintage Siraj or new one?,3
Ez mi win,3
Please Sky we all got your point now please stop :),10
SKY ❤️❤️,6
Surya Kumara Yadav Remember the name,6
This game is a win for uncapped domestic talent,12
"These two are quite similar, Hardik feels like SKY on drugs a bit",12
Kohli gotta take it easy with showing his emotions in the field. He just made Surya more focused.,6
Smooth,3
"Jhaantus, giving half volleys on pads",4
Oh boy. What a shot.,2
No celebration is the best celebration.,8
SKY playing at a better average and strike rate than both Iyer and Pandey🤐,13
Sky is playing effortless!,7
So happy for sky!! Take that selection committee in your face!!,12
Damn SKY,7
Fuck you selectors,6
We all predicted this would happen...,1
Why does Manish Pandey gets selected over SKY over and over again?,5
"If there is an injury to any batsman, SKY is going to be the replacement I guess.",1
Mumbai's game to lose,3
What a shot. That was like knife on butter.,4
Suryakumar: Fuck r/Kohli,8
Beautiful shot,4
"SKY is visibly pissed off

Absolute chad innings till now",4
"What a garbage field placement, what tf are they expecting to do here?",2
"""Yea lets save a bucket load of over of siraj for the death""",4
stare him down now why don’t ya,3
SKY to Kohli- *Casual Deathstare*,6
Surya wow 😍,3
What's up with sky and kohli koi bata do pls,1
"I think Steyn has had enough of cricket now. 

Can't see him getting smashed in every other match. 

He should consider retirement. While his pace is great, but his wicket taking ability has fallen at a drastic rate over the years.",5
BRUHHH SKY OMGGGG FUCK YOU KOACH and BCCI,7
"Get this man, a selection.",5
Is it me or does SKY look very sad right now?,1
Gimme 100 replays of that shot. Majestic,1
"Simple elegant shot. Well-done Yadav, great innings. 
Now win this and show the cunts who doubted you",2
Selecting Siraj in Indian team was a mistake,0
"SKY, you dropped this 👑",10
"I always want Mumbai to lose every single time but today I want SKY to give a huge fuck you to Koach and the selection board. 

Also want MI to lose but that doesn’t seem possible now.",13
Beautyful shot,2
Now our NRR is fucked too. Thanks,2
SKY is the best Indian no.3 T20 batsman. Don’t @ me,7
These balls by Siraj are not exactly bad,8
"If they can still pick Rohit, can they also maybe still pick SKY?",3
KKR why did you leave Suryakumar Yadav? :(,2
Kohli be like : Bruh,1
Hot trash from RCB bowlers,1
What was the tussle between sky and Kohli?,1
SKY teaching lolhli and his boys how to bat,4
I want SKY to hit the winning runs and give a stare to kohli so hard that he just resigns from captaincy from all forms of cricket,15
This is some exquisite batting from Suryakumar! India's missing out...,8
Fuck MI & RCB! Get Surya on plane down under with Indian team.,5
"Oh God, wow! We have witnessed some exquisite batting from Devdutt, and now Sky",7
Bole the Siraj nahi..,3
Some glorious batting,5
Net session. SKY is treating RCB like a net session.,10
Pls bhogle fuck off. Where were you when padikkal was playing all those delightful strokes?,1
"Did Hardik say ""har ball yaad dilaunga tujhe""?

Wonder what that was about",8
Sky destroying kohli's blue eyed boy is so good.,8
"Have RCB bowlers ever heard something called ""Variation""",3
"yo kohli, for you SKY is the limit. remember that.",13
My god I've never been so needlessly angry at a batsman before,9
Finish the game Siraj! Finish it,4
Lmao chonky Tiwari only one to not stand and applaud SKY,5
tbf even I would applaud him in slow-mo for that 50,3
Lively debate going on in Star Sports Tamil with Srikanth batting hard for SKY instead of Mayank.,7
Lord Siraj Loading,2
SKY showing Kohli why he should be selected,12
Rcb for d win,3
Cheeky,3
Game over,5
Smart shots,5
Lol Siraj,5
"All this talk about Samuels and his cologne has got me thinking. Ben Stokes should launch his own cologne called Ben Stokes, Kohli would advertise it for free",31
DONT FUCKING STOP SKY,8
Danny Morrison chip BC,4
Siraj back in form guys B),7
SKY my man I have no words to describe the way you are treating v these higher presssure situations like net practice,10
SKY is so fucking calm it's astonishing,7
Sky : Im the ABD now.,5
Cheeky af,3

Siraj is backk babyyy,8
Fuck this guy is classy.,10
"SKY wants to finish the game himself, you can see that.",5
Match Over. Good Night Everyone.,3
Brain dead for kaoch to put siraj in death,2
Classic shots all around the ground!,3
Does Rohit get a say in picking the India squad?,3
Thats lunatic from SKY....,4
"Beautiful shot, now show us that attitude again Siraj. I missed the reply. Class from SKY",3
Let the bat do the talking and aggression! Let's gooooooooooo SKY!!!,8
SKY is on fire,3
He's sending the message straight to the selectors.,8
not to go on about SKY but I have a big phat crush on him now,9
Siraj at death lol,3
SKY is a top tier bat,6
Kohli is getting soft with his dark arts. Sledge Surya Kumar out of park. His intent can't be better than your sledges,9
Kohli getting paid in his own style,2
[removed],5
Yes boy show them selectors!!,4
"Lol if Mumbai lose this it will be such a meme. Whatever Siraj tries goes for 4, poor guy.",3
Yeah fuck off kohli. Shove your attitude up your ass,16
Meanwhile Iyer and Pandey watching this: _Surprised Pikachu_,21
Gond tod diye.,6
"Siraj doesn't have a yorker, we can't have him bowling death",2
How is this guy not selected for India? His range of shots is much wider than Iyer's.,31
It's the same shit every year.. I'm just depressed now man,12
That's poetic fucking justice for ya.,16
SKY turning into peak Tendulkar.,14
"KOHLI, DUN FUCK WIT SKY!! 🐐🐐",11
How dare SKY hit the Swingin Siraj for boundaries!,7
"No seriously, fuck the selectors and fuck Kohli for his bias against MI players.",18
Neither Samson nor Pandey can hold a candle to Surya's consistency and maturity.,17
Amazing show by Suryakumar Yadav. Select him guys. Come on. What else does he have to do?,7
"IK Pandey is considered more of a finisher thus made the team, but never should he be chosen over SKY.",10
this is gem of an innings from SKY.. showing how skillful he is.. good for him .. bad for us.. :(,7
Damn I love SKY,6
SKY should just finish this cleanly and show Koach/Selectors what they are missing.,11
Love it the way the camera points towards Koach everytime SKY hits a boundary.,37
We have Dessii ABD and he is not in Indian Team...Let that sink in,19
Just so much difference between batsmen approach in MI and CSK,4
Rcb choketh,3
Guys 12 runs in the iver from an RCB bowler at death is very economical,10
"If Pandya-Polly's SR in death is anything to go by, this match could be over in an over or two.",10
"Why would you give siraj death overs, play him like Sandeep or chahar",11
Greame Swann is orgasmic again,11
The shot of the tournament thus far was when SKY reverse scooped archer over the keeper for six,22
Can anyone see mr Pandey playing like sky? I know Pandey has played more international games.. but sky shots are pleasant to watch,9
Kohli majorly out of form. RCB going to pay for it again this year,7
This is the Siraj I know,5
"I was hoping for a MI loss but Kohli changed my mind. He is good at getting under the skin game. But unfortunately for him, its me and not Sky.",12
What incidents did sky have that showed that he had lot of attitude,3
No bowler can beat a batsman who's hurt for not getting selected for the Indian team even after performing better than his counterparts.,20
Remember playing turning out of form with  fatherhood? Kohli is peaking early..,0
"KKR fans, whose win will benefit us more?",5
Pollard yet to come lol rcb for 3rd place,6
Where is dube? Why aren't they giving him the ball?,6
Guys Surya didn't get selected because he shaved his beard a day before selection not much rocket science . ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,16
I’ve never seen such hype over such a shit car,5
why does SKY give a thumbsup and no ball sign after every ball??,6
"Siraj took 3 wickets in the match against KKR

Koach: *ah Finally a good death bowler*",14
Sunil Joshi in the mud,6
"36 in 15 required for DC to go second. Plss SKY do it for yourself, MI and DC",7
SKY went into God mode after Kohli sledged him.,13
I love how Smithy subtly bags that car everytime he's forced to flog it.,3
"""Is he going to Australia? Why not?"" Danny hitting r/Cricket right in the feels",15
SKY has the entire mayan calendar tattooed on him,13
Two back to back wickets coming after timeout. But.... We'll still not be favorites to win this,1
If there's one player I want Ambani to use his influence for it's SKY,13

"Bruh, even if we lose this match, I just love most of our lineup. Very good top order batting (Rohit/QdK/SKY/Ishan), elite middle order batting, and great bowling (Boult/Bumrah is a juicy duo).

Right now, Tiwari is my lone issue in the lineup; Rohit plz come back soon .... But the rest are mostly solid players.",11
RCB needs to bowl an over without a boundary,1
this is the first match where I’m rooting for MI... suryakumar yadav converting me into a real mumbaikar for a change?,16
I want SKY to get out to watch Kohli celebrate,0
MI never fucking struggle while batting ffs,11
Kohli losing the battle agasint SKY.,9
Siraj was the perfect choice for the upcoming tour... NOT,-1
Suryakumar is such a class batsman,9

Cheeka very animated in Star Sports Tamil,3
"SKY having great revenge innings, liked it",5
"r/cricket be like:- 
Friendship with smudge over. Now SKY is my best friend.",10
Varun CV getting selected just after a good season is kinda insane he might be good but if we judge just cos of 1 good season then SKY not being in it makes even lesser sense,9
"Cakewalk for MI,unless they pull a KXIP vs KKR",3

Swann out here whacking it to the alltroz,2
"Kohli shd not have behaved with Surya the way he did , he shd sledge hardik the Pollard krunal , hope after match he talks chill with him",1
SKY high💥,3
SKY didn't get selected because he was gunning for no 3 spot in t20 which VK will not leave.,18
"Now watch Punjab, Kolkata and/or Hyderabad qualify instead of Delhi and Bangalore. Only Mumbai look like they are guaranteed qualification especially with their monstrous NRR",8
Bruh Nescafé advert I don't really care if your nickname was Princess in school.,5
This guy Siraj is another arrogant bloke  like his captain. Now combine it  with 3 chokers  in the team and that explains why RCB has not won  a single IPL cup.,4
"Even if Morris bowls two maidens, this game is gone.",6
"Manish Pandey should not be in the Indian team , not because he is not good because players miles ahead of him are waiting for chances. Raina Rayudu scenes",6
koach stark and siraj parker in tears.,2
"MI's success comes from 3 factors:

- Bumrah
- Two of the world's best finishes in the same team who also bowl well (pandya + pollard) 
- Two of the best non-capped players",12
"I like SKY, he's been very good this year and definitely should've been selected for India but you lot are going overboard with the SKY praise now lmao

How's someone calling him desi de Villiers? Lmao",12
What better way to put out a statement after getting denied a deserved T20I batting spot.,9
[removed],9
People acting as if Kohli isn't always out of form in the ipl. 2016 was an anomaly,6
We might have to make a second international India team to give justice to so many cricketing talent from the 1.3 billion population.,7
"no hate for siraj, but i am really enjoying how sky is treating his mediocre bowling.",15
Can't wait for the Australia series where Steve Smith is going to fuck Koach,8
DC fans should wish MI chase 35 in 14 balls so that they regain their 2nd position,4
"If Mumbai wins (and SKY closes out with say .... 70 runs), who gets MOTM? SKY or Bumrah with 3/14?

I think Bumrah saved our hides this match, so I'd give it to him.",2
Tiwary managed to con the selectors into representing India with that Dhoni hair style. Sky needs to grow a beard like Koach.,7
"{India Domestic record}


Kedar Jadhav in 150 Matches with Average 45 and strike rate is 103. 




Suryakumar Yadav in almost 100 matches with average 35 and strike rate is 100. 




- Stats do lie.",7
How do MI afford to have so many good players?,2
"As long as this goes to the last over, I'll take solace in the fact that we put up a good fight with no Saini",7
[deleted],3
Damn. Girls these days are interested in cricket with some knowledge and that's a good thing!,8
"When Kohli acts hyper in the field like he's on steroids,  it is never a good sign for his own team",3
"Siraj: effective at the top, shit during the death.


Koach: Ok, I will keep for the death...


*stretegy meme goes here*",5
When padikkal has a higher strike rate than kohli smh,6
Srikanth is that one uncle who only gets 2 things out of 10 right but hearing him speak about it feels so right. Sort of like a Samson in commentry if you will.,5
Did kohli say something to SKY ?,7
"SKY be like, 'On Your Face' to Koach.",4
How many hundreds is Smudge gonna score against Koach during the series? At least 4?,5
"SKY: How much should I perform for you to consider me for team selection

Selectors : Yes",11
Some one for the bluff at least go and tell sky that he got selected to Indian team and end this massacre,3
Match turning point was padikals needlessly brilliant catch to get rid of Tiwari.,21
SKY is such an amazing batsman.,7
SKY is hurt man...He was better than most of them and still you are not taking him to australia...,13
Why is this sub so anti-kohli?,7
"Unpopular Opinion: Regardless of whatever runs Kohli scored this ipl, for his standard he has been shit with the bat, not just shaky but shit.",21
How much say does the captain have in the selection process? I remember reading a statement by Kohli that selection is not his area of operation. Is this true?,17
[deleted],22
How does Manish fucking Pandey get picked in the squad but SKY doesn't.,26
"Now comes the problem for RCB, the death overs!",8
Dale Steyn's hairstyle is nice !!,4
damn Jacqueline ruining concentration from the match.,13
People just wanna kill Kohli today. Shows how much people will hate you.,16
Why is cricket Twitter biased against SKY?,16
"SKY has performed as a finisher, tail ender, opener, and middle order... i think he definitely deserves a chance in the T20i team.",9
shankar wouldve tactically dropped tiwary.,3
"Why don't they send out 600 sr bumrah, are they playing him as a specialist bowler ffs",4
"Holy fuck this thread is Soo toxic

Kohli is biased against sky because he plays for mi, wtf?

Do you guys only watch ipl or what",15
Bro you guys serioussly trolling Kohli?,-6
Ahsaas channa is playing cricket now?,2
"Effing sick of how RCB keeps letting the match slip away, keep it tight man you losers. Save the run rate at least",8
Seriously don't understand india going with a  accumulator heavy top order for both odis and t20s.,8
holy shit this sub.... its not like kohli is the selector of the team,14
Happy for SKY.,2
Surya doesn't seem happy man he wants to win this match. *spelling,10
"Remember SKY was really good opening for MI two seasons ago (their highest run getter iirc) and played as a finisher for KKR. Guy is so versatile, just baffles me why he never made our T20 side",12
RCB need a mega auction with absolute dogs. Bring in some fire power after AB. Someone like Pollard. And one quality Indian batsman to open with Paddikal. Finch is not the answer.,4
People go on about England's batting depth and with good reason but this fella can't get into the India squad. This batting is as good as I've seen this IPL.,13
SKY decimated RCB.,9
"Aight so its 34 from 12 to save the nrr

Please for the love of god atleast defend this",10
Chad Pandya vs Virgin Morris /s,3
[deleted],4
"manish pandey is like that piece of \*urd stuck to the bowl that does not go away no matter how many times you flush. i have been seeing his name in the squad for as long as i remember and except one innings in AUS, i recall nothing of substance from him.",-2
What is the highest ever NRR achieved by a team in a single edition of IPL?,9
This Mumbai Indians team is very strong compared to other teams this time in IPL. All because MI gave so many opportunities to youngsters to grow themselves to be match winners.,8
"Mumbai know they have to play out Morris,there are 2 overs of freebies left",6
[deleted],3
"Guys Kohli bad SKY good

upvotes to the left",16
It’s the fucking hairband. If steyn gets rid off the hairband he might get a 5-for the next match. It worked for Siraj,9
I am supporting RCB but enjoying watching SKY innings as slap to indian selectors,3
The reason RCB are a meme is because this squad is fundamentally flawed and every auction the people who are supposed to build this team are letting it down. Even if you cannot scout well at least look inwards towards Karnataka teams to get better players than Dube and Gurkeerat ffs.,6
"Jfc this sub really hates Kohli lmao

You do realise he's still India's captain and best batsman

He'll also have minimal, if any, say over squad selection",5
Smash a couple sizes and this is over.,2
"So next over Steyn or Siraj?

I am going Steyn!",1
[deleted],13
How is Kohli representing India as a skipper when we have many good players with way better temperament,3
"When filled with rage, all we could do is see the sky high",7
Mi fans are soo toxic dumbfucks. Change my mind.,-14
"Wait, is it Kohli who selected the Aus squads?",10
Two overs of Siraj-Steyn left no worries,6
Maybe gavaskar should ask the selectors to explain the SKY decision. I care more about that than Rohit to be honest,21
Kohli is not standing at long on? Means RCB are still in the game boys,3
I think SKY is one of the only few Indian batsmen who can play spin comfortably,17
Mumbai doesn’t have a single liability player. All other teams have them. Rcb has gurkeerat and dube,16
Looks like their plan is to attack the bowlers other than Morris.,4
A player who's perturbed over missing out despite performing comparatively well is being stared at and intimidated by the national captain. Not cool!,11
This kohli bashing is too much,7
"Poor padikkal, plays a blinder of an innings and takes one of the catches of the tournament only to see his bowlers shit the bed",9
Time to call emergency selector meeting,4
siraj : win one game and lose 2!,4
"Now, watch out.. Rcbians talking like it's not about kohli being the mastermind behind the selection xD",4
[deleted],15
"Next over is going for 20, doesn't matter if it's Steyn or Siraj",11
[deleted],3
Fuck,1
RCB suddenly realised their fans werent using their calculators this year,10
SKY toying with the field placement.,5
SKY art.,1
MI to lose this,2
Koach is fuuuummmiiinggggg,6
kohli’s eyes filled with regret for challenging lord SKY,8
Back to shitty probability to calculate RCBs chances in the remaining matches,4
"They want to attack Steyn or Siraj, dont they?",5
Choose tuk tuk Pandey instead bc,4
I remember CSK quota memes from the early 2010's. Good to see that tradition is continuing with RCB and Kohli.,6
He's like an oil painting!,3
Morris is a great utility player to have in T20s tbh,2
"For fucks sake man SKY, get your point, kindly fuck off now",8
Kohli's shit field setting,4
"Worst part for RCB is that a wicket would mean that Pollard comes to bat, that way the match will finish even quicker",7
It was MI death bowling VS RCB death bowling today. And we all could have expected how it could have ended in the first over of the match.,2
Surya kumar *monalisa* Yadav.,5
I remember watch SKY play back in 2014 or something for KKR and he was a finisher who used to play his shots down third man (mostly in that region) and now he plays shots all across the ground. Such a joy to watch then and now as well.,5
CSK flairs have faded.,4
"Simple and beautiful shot. What a placement, he is in such a good touch. Well-done SKY",1
The meltdown of RCB fans here after seeing their captain get a little criticism lol.,2
Id go dube over steyn any fkn day,3
what the hell was that field,1
"If RCB lose this game, what are their scenarios for not making it to the play-offs? Is it going be easy?",1
We are all yellove tomorrow,2
Who started the sky vs kohli? Sky?,4
RCB aint making the playoffs.,3
[deleted],8
"How the BCCI didn't pick this guy to go to Australia, I'll never know",2
Steyn’s gonna finish it off this over,2
HDFC ad is so dumb yet so funny,1
Duh styn for death?,2
"Important boundary that 
 
RCB could have vome back in the game with RRR touching 10",4
"Even tho RCB is losing, I'm happy SKY gets to say Fuck you right in front of Koach",9
THAT'S A WIDE.,6
"SKY has kept the boundaries coming at regular intervals even with wickets failing around him

Reminds me of Kohli from T20 WC 2016",10
"MI is an underrated choker's team,. They will choke IMO.",-7
Well at least he is in the Ambani team. Right guys?,4
"If that is not wide, I don't know what is.",4
The final over. *Finally*,4
Pls go back to 2013 Steyn for this 1 over,2
Free sun benchod that's big fucking a wide,2
"Bleh, we slowed down too much this last 2 overs guys ..... come on Hardik. Can't be batting 100 strike rate in the closing of a match .... need you to smash runs. Or get out. Polly is behind you to come in a close.",1
How was that not a wide lmao,5
Why isnt budget stokes doing anything?,4
How the fuck wasn't that wide lmao,2
Is this Sky's best innings?,1
Big brain Kohli giving Siraj an over at the death.,1
"Guys relax, you will see SKY bowl some medium pace next game and bang he's our fast bowling all rounder in Australia.",2
Unnecessary boundary to give away. Took that fielder out and bowl it right where SKY wants it,1
"Dale ""Jesus"" Steyn",1
"Yeah, people here need to chill the fuck out. Kohli is going to lead India to a series win against Australia away, while Suryakumar will be in a conundrum whether to play for India blue or India red in Duleep trophy.",-8
"27 from 7 lezzgooo

Save the NRR, CSK style",1
Now imagine losing Odi or T20s in Australia and thinking we have Suryakumar back in India 😭😂😭😂😂😂,6
Steyn do something man,1
I'd say that was a wide.,1
"Kohli has been bad for his standards yes this season but his standards are itself exceptionally high his best season had 973 runs. Next best is Warner with 848 runs. So even though he is not playing very well, he is still our best bat, in T20s maybe not but in all 3 formats yes.",2
"Test fast bowler hoga apne ghar ka, Indian players to steyn this season.",0
"Why is everyone caring so much about NRR for DC and RCB now, like there are 2 more games remaining for both teams, right ? 

Or am I really missing something ?

Edit : Thanks for the replies. And I understand if DC fans wished MI beats RCB really bad .... But the whole 18.4 overs thing is what I don't get lol.",3
How is that not a wide,4
Umpire completely blind,4
"Bruh, how wasn't that wide",6
Remember how abd cunted steyn when he was playing for dc? 22 off his over iirc. Can hardik do the same?,3
Haven't seen it but from the comments I'm guessing Kohli was being a Chutiya (twat) to SKY,7
"it’s not the season for mangoes, dugout fam",1
Pls someone give 50Rs to Steyn to get a haircut and gtfo of the Playing 11,1
"That was a wide ffs

Where is your money, Ambani ?!!",4
Shit ball,1
Looks like the match is going to end early thanks to Steyn,2
insert- lagta hai Abu Dhabi tak ambani ka paisa nahi pahucha,3
How is that not a wide?,2
Wide if I’ve ever seen one,2
Lmao absolutely got away with that wide,8
I feel like the ball to bowl to Hardik would be full and aim to the leg stump as he covers the stumps.,3
What is Steyn doin.....come on man .... You are better than that.,1
[deleted],-8
"Even don't give this a wide , chutiya umpire",2
Sky has to score 400+ runs now they have to take him as extra like natarajan is also travelling.,2
Pandya wishing he was Dhoni,1
Take it to 18.5 atleast!,3
Umpire to Steyn: bruh!,7
"Lee is right, alphonso mangoes are awesome.",3
Steyn more like pain.,4
At least let them get the runs and not bowl wides!,3
Stupid decision to only play one death bowler,1
Even if MI had a target of 180 or 190 at this point they would have easily chased that too,1
Steyn- *you want a wide? Say no more*,2
Steyn is a shadow of his former self. I don't remember Brett Lee being like that toward the end of his career.,2
All this fake cheer for the batsman for a wide?,3
Dont fuck this up,4
Steyn looks rusty,3
Remember when Pollard stood at wide line while facing a delivery once against CSK when umpire didn't give the previous ball wide.,14
Steyn bowling some serious pace here jeez.,3
I am expert in Maths. A six is better than a wide or no ball,2
MI Probably has most match winners than any team,2
Hardik needs to hit some boundry's SKY might get out hitting all,2
Swann straight up said “fixed” when the fair play table came up lmfao.,10
"SKY deserved a t20 spot, once again goes to show kohli's bias towards his friends",1
"（╯ ͡° ▽ ͡°）╯︵ ┻━┻

that's it.. we are back in business.. let's now concentrate on who needs to win/lose for us to qualify.. and hope for the best..",6
It is sad to see steyn bowl so badly. He was one of my favorite bowlers growing up.,3
Steyn Gun firing blanks ... again.,3
Surely there was a nick there?,3
"One from Steyn, Morris and Siraj? RCB can't catch a break",2
Not bad from steyn,1
Whisky owners paid umpires hehehe,2
oh fuckoff Steyn,3
"*We are fucked, we ain’t making it this time*

Other club fans: Nooooo We will do it. Hope. Believe.

RCB fans: We know",5
Steyn may lose the game here.,1
Only way SKY can get in team india is if Mota bhai calls dada,1
Steyn the wide merchant,2
[deleted],-1
Will we get a similar [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7QIN7h5ZU&ab_channel=MetroSaga) if somehow RCB wins tonight?,0
Dot wide dot wide lol,2
Why would you not play udana?,5
"It's quite sad to see the decline in Steyn from when he was the best pacer in the game.

He even looks like a washed up pornstar these days.",10
Swann just shitposts in the commentary box. He probably spams hotstar comment sections too.,9
Steyn going to bowl 26 wides so that Siraj doesn't have to bowl,1
2 balls 2 dots and 2 runs,3
"Good ol free runs,. well done. Cunt one ball to six Pandya",5
Bowl a slower one and outsmart pandya here,2
Bruh is Swanny actually trying to get fired?,4
Get fucked,4
As a Liverpool fan I never unclench.,1
Lol steyn is so scared of bowling in Pandya s arc,5
"RCB, either win it or lose in 7 balls. 

Ye to KLPD ho rha",3
"Whip out the calculator boys

Its that time again",4
How much say does Kohli have in the selections?,1
"1 dot ke saath 1 wide free , new scheme",9
"Wide again, and again, and again😂😂🤣🤣",8
"Instead of piling on pressure, Steyn is making it easy for LMAO",3

Suryakumar is having Uthappa IPL season of 2012-16 where he made 400+ continuously every season but wasn't picked. Now we all hate Uthappa don't we? 😭😂😭😂😭😂,6
Mini over karo yaar,3
Poor Steyn.. feeling sad for him,6
"Steyn gonna practice wide Yorkers right here, right now",6
"Steyn mate, we're playing on the pitch to the right of the one you seem to be aiming at",2
WTF steyn. You had 2 great dots,3
As a RCB fan all excepted was an entertaining  ipl.. Didn't care of RCB ended up coming last or first... But then RCB had given a bowling performance that'll be remembered for long time.. Only to end up showing thier true colours at the end moment...,2
Wtf with wides,3

This Steyn guy needs to retire ffs,3
WTF IS HAPPENING WITH THIS BOWLING,5
Is this some strategy to make em slow down?,4
"If Steyn doesn't pick a hattrick now. He should fuck off -_-

Enough is enough!!",3
"Look at players who got into team India from RCB and then from MI. RCB has lot more. That means we groomed a lot of talent than MI, but in the case of RCB thier prices went on increasing. For eg bumrah is paid just 7cr in Mumbai Indians.",-1
Baby over,6
Koachs master plan to avoid SKY from scoring more than paddikal,7
Lol Steyn is scared shit less from Hardik man. 2020 is just unreal.,6

Am I in a time loop or what?,3
24 more wides to go,1
Okay say it goes to the last over...WHO BOWLS IT?,1
Steyn is past it,3
"Pretty convinced the dude bowling is Jesus, not Steyn",2
Bishop calm tf down mate,3
Seeing Steyn Gun trying to bowl wider from stumps just because the batsman can hit him is humiliating :),6
This is how i bowl when i haven't on played cricket in years,11
Scenes if Mumbai loses from here.,2
"Super over,

You heard it hear first",2
Lawda saalaa,1
DC is at the bottom of fair play tables even when ethical mind playing for them. Time for some ethics lessons to the youngsters!,4
Has Surya chewed the same gum through out his inning?,4
"Sizzling yorkers by Steyn, JUST NOT ON THE RIGHT PITCH",4

[removed],6
Cut your hair already dale,3
Yeah Udana was better,3
"SKY is showing his real class, power and finesse here...",7
Fuck Kohli for disrespecting my man SKY,9
Koach’s face says that he’d grill Steyn but he’s Steyn.,8
"Full off side was working, why change????",3
So Kohli getting punished in his own style,5
Just finish the game in the next over. SKY has been amazing today,4
"Sky is the most underrated indian player

Fight me",5
My dude is just fiddling with RCB at this point,6
Bahahahaha. Sky is a man possessed. Can't win against him tonight boys.,3
Pack it up boys go sleep early.,3
This match is over...Steyn is so washed up sigh,3
Sky show him yes FIRE OFFF,1
Man.... It's not Steyns day today.,3
Lmao the kohli household has the best reactions,4
Sky: eat that koach,2
Koach is dead inside,3
Remember when umpire didn't give a obvious wide against CSK and Pollard stood at the wide line for the next ball 😂😂,9
Fuck off selectors!!!,8
"Steyn come on, man",7
SKY is totally fueled by rage today. No stopping him,9
Steyn removes his mask to reveal that it was Siraj all along,8
Even Anushka doesn't want to be there anymore,9
"SKY shot variation is absurd,what a pleasing player to watch",10
I thought that dude was ready to catch it crossing the boundary lmao,5
"This is what suryakumar has to do to get selected grow a beard, get tattoo and reduce SR to 120",7
the wides were a better tactic,6
Bowls all these wides and still concedes a Six ROFL,1
Preggo Anushka chilling there,7
"Kohli deserves this rubbing in the face from SKY, Ganguly and Dhoni were way better in sticking by the right players and giving them opportunity",8
SKY plays normal shots in ecstatic ways,6
[deleted],5
Fuck off to whoever deserves to fuck off,12
[deleted],13
Sweeping steyn is special talent..  look on kohlis face though,3
SKY is the new ABD.,4
Suryakumar maar raha hai,5
Enoughhhh Surya everyone understood your point that you deserve the place now just stop ffs :),11
"Maybe siraj takes a hat trick maiden next over....
who knows...",4
How did RCB waste such a great start today will be a mystery to us all,4
Which smartass selected Steyn instead of Udana? Fucking sue him.,11
"Ngl I really hate Pandey right now, through no fault of his own",5
Sky taking it out on Koach for not picking him,2
woah steyn’s over is still going lol,4
Steyn smiling when getting smacked looks so humiliating,4
Koach channeling the pakistani bald guy.,13
"Kannan Devan Tea Pudi, RCB Pudupudi",8
Anuskha having angry orgasm/s,-11
Steyn just couldn't wait for The Hundred so decided to bowl a 10-ball over in a T20,2
"Dale Steyn needs to stay in the dugout. He was incredible at his prime, but I'm afraid his time has come.",4
This is a huge fuck you innings from Suryakumar against Kohli,16
Virat gonna name his kid Suryakumar,11
Should be over in the 19th. Just give it to Siraj,1
"Thank you for the memories, steyn.",5
Sky is like I will hit each and every bowler of your side out of the park. Deal with it.,6
"Kohli was seen abusing the giant screen after it showed "" the S.K.Y is lit""",10
Pls just last 6 more balls atleast,4
Udana died for this,18
Koach has the look of a man who knows his tuk tuk batting and terrible selections cost them this game.,8
Inb4 Morris quadruple wicket maiden,6
Steyn bowls like shit for a top bowler,3
Why does Sky not get selected for the indian national team?,9
KKR miss an Indian batsman of SKY’s caliber. Can rebuild and score quickly as well.,1
How did we not get two their?,2
\#dispatched is the new buzzword in the Dugout.,4
Kohli dying inside each time SKY hits a boundary.,11
Chad cameraman,4
For how long is Saini out?,2
Last over is Siraj take it easy MI,3
Who’s innings is better Suryakumar yadav or Padikkal?,2
how good it is too see that disappointment on lolhli's mugface 😍😍,4
MI can go all the way without the cheese vada pav...,-1
Siraj or Morris for next over?,1
This over makes Mohammad Asif look like a modest man,3
cinematography today : 🔥🔥,5
[deleted],0
Should try and finish the match in the next over only by scoring 10+,2
SKY was chewing gum and staring at virat before virat came close to him,6
Bowl dube,1
My god that just looked like an U14 game,3
Anushka thinking aaj VK ka frustration konse social media ke user pe deflect karu ?,10
Bc Kohli is a waste of 17cr,3
Steyn has been washed for years now why is he still getting chances,2
Damn the cameraman is on 🔥 tonight😂😂😂,12
"At this point it aint even a match between mi and rcb, its just sky raging",3
India selectors should be ashamed of themselves for not picking Surya. This needs to happen. Koach should protest to the board to get him involved.,11
That was last from steyn this ipl i guess.,6
"Broadcast director so tired of showing Kohli's face after every SKY good shot, they now showing Anushka.",12
[deleted],3
"9D underwater chess by Koach and Steyn, bowl wides so SKY can't reach 100 #khelodimaagse",9
Cmon Mumbai...how about a superover? I'm sure you need the practice.,2
"Steyn's been a champion for a long time, and I don't want him to be known for fizzling out at the end. He should take on a mentor role imo, if he's interested in it.",7
Udana is so much better than Steyn ATM,4
[deleted],12
Was Umesh really worse than Dale.... really?,0
Kohli deliberately played 15-20 runs short just so SKY can't get a century,7
72 off 39 without one slog shot . Such class,7
Imagine having a past it Steyn as your main fast bowler,3
BCCI apology thread to SKY when?,7
"To be fair to dale, udana would’ve done pretty much the same too.",1
Sky chewing the gum as if it's kohli,4
someone pay the scriptwriters to make it 10 needed in 1 over pls,6
"I still don’t understand why SKY doesn’t get selected for the national team

I’m sure he’ll impress everyone",2
Good times when I thought bumrah was a Abhishek Nayar clone,4
"Even as an MI fan, I still hate to see Steyn like this because he was one of my favorites growing up",5
With a heavy heart I have to say Dale Steyn should retire :( :( :(,4
This over could go for a maiden and still Siraj won't be able to defend 16,5
I'd take SKY over VK,3
Steyn has been terrible in all his games this season...miss the old steyn,2
Anushka bhabhi is so god damn pretty.,-3
Bumrah looked like a kid and Koach looked like Tiwari's younger brother in that clip from 2013.,4
Bumrah's first and 100th wicket..  so much maturity.,4
"DJ playing eye of the tiger. Lmao, proper trolling",2
"braindead selection and friendship bias is why kohli will never win an IPL or World Cup, there's nothing wrong with his captaincy, his random team generator has lost india the test series in south africa, nz and England.",0
[deleted],-5
How could selectors keep SKY out of T20 line up beats me.,1
"Well done SKY. That's the best possible response to the moronic squad selection.

The selectors deserve to be lampooned thoroughly for that call. This guy deserves to be in the T20I squads at the very least.",7
Hardik really boundary chasing way too hard.,2
Sky just outside the top 10 in orange cap 😍. Also the joint highest SR along with Mayank Aggarwal,4
"Let Steyn just do BBQ, its painful to watch such a fierce bowler lost his prime, its like a toothless alpha male lion waiting to die because of age.",2
"Why does Sky not get selected for the indian national team?

No seriously, asking the Indian redditors here a question",6
"Missing Udana, aren't you, RCB? Ffs",4
"ABD probably to himself in the field: "" Finally a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary""",7
SKY striking at 185 here damn,5
"Bumrah first IPL match : Yelling and screaming after Kohli wicket

Bumrah now : Chad smile",14
People are saying Kohli is an aggressive captain. Lol if Kohli is an aggressive captain in his tactics then I have a big dick.,6
Please tell me someone got a screencap of the expression on Anushka's face lol.,5
Suryakumar has become Indias's Fawad Alam in LOI's,7
Hardik Pandya without his bowling is a discount SKY don't @ me,3
At least rcb won't drop to 3rd lol,2
"Can't believe with all the laptops, stats, video analytics, hawkeye and what not, they still can't figure out it's the fucking HEADBAND that's ruining bowlers.",13
At this point i will be happy even if SKY has a adam voges like international career.,3
Steyn's current bowling is a stain on his career,9
"Suddenly this sub turns into Facebook and Twitter

Ha ironic",7
This thread got toxic real fast,4
"Well might as well

Come on SKY, give Virat the middle finger....end our suffering",1
Who is the white RCB guy they keeping showing whenever Steyn bowls wide,4
Well imagine if MI loses from here,3
Steyn is just a waste of an overseas spot. I'm glad Broady/Jimmy never went to the IPL. Would be horrendous to see them like this.,6
I like this strategy against Hardik. At the cost of few wides you can stop Hardik from going to off side. Those 2-4 extra runs are worth getting Hardik to doubt his strategy.,2
Would RCB have been a different bowling side if Starc continued to play for them?,5
"*SKY exhibits his batting ability*

r/cricket experts: yeaah fuck kohli",15
Super over pls,6
What is hardik doing?,7
Surya plays with the field very well.,3
"Steyn would often give away runs like this even in the past few years, in case people are thinking this is new for him.",1
Is Siraj bowling last over? Scenes if he defends,2
"Siraj gonna do the 20th over, lmao  


if we reach there that is",3
"Swann, Styris and Binga get paid to sit in an AC room and watch some cricket :(",4
"How could you not pick sky,padikkal or Bishnoi in any of the teams for India?",3
When was the last time Steyn bowled great?,3
How's everything going on no man's land,3
RCB retain their second position,4
"Kohli if you're so damn mad at sky, just go ahead and bowl your awesome leg breaking off medium swing balls now.",7
"If Morris doesn't give away any boundary this over, the last over is gonna be nervy af !",3
Let’s just skip to the super over,-1
I want super over,1
"Goti muh me aaagye hai 
...",3
this is surfer steyn not bowler steyn.,3
"Geez, K.Pandya has to be the strongest weak link in a team ever. Mumbai is stacked.",9
"Head to Head guys
Sky 1 - 0 Kohli",6
I want Surya and Kohli to clash while taking a double and then both stare into each other's eyes.,8
fucking perfect reply by SKY to bewda,6
Bumrah aged well,9
"MoM Sky or Bumrah? Bumrah took wickets of DDP batting at 74(45), Kohli and Dube. Kinda tough choice",6
Fuck the Indian selectors and team management. Bunch of incompetent buffoons throwing shit at the wall and hoping it sticks instead of doing what's right.,0
Bumrah looked so different lmao,3
Lord Siraj to defend 7 runs in the final over.,4
"Yadav has been an unsung hero in MI's success over the last few years. 

For all the talk of the Bombay lobby, he never seems to get his due.",6
"No one:

Chahal: Fields while backing up with the body

Nice. Good boy. You a good player",3
RCB playing inflate deflate strategy with fans all the while by winning first few matches only to lose in the second half of the tournament and not qualify. We have been clowned 🤡,3
Only Bumrah and Shami would give any chance from this situation.,3
What a shot by love machine fuccboi💦,3
Hard dick power😎😎👍🏽,3
SKY showed 10x more intent than Koach. What an impressive display.,10
Our beautiful WWL pattern comes to an end :(,2
thank god,3
"Dale Steyn in IPL 2020

3.3-0-33-1 (ER 9.00)

4-0-57-0 (ER 14.25)

4-0-43-0 (ER 10.75)

Tournament ER: 11.56

His only wicket in the season is that of Sandeep Sharma.


Cricbuzz",6
"Hardik targeting altroz

Respect +",9
Dale Steyn 43(24) MVP,6
I’m laughing way too hard at these shots of Kohli lmfao 😭,7
Hardik has incredible power for a twig,8
All the 4 MI wickets are left handers,4
Go pick that ball said Pandya,7
And this guy is not in squad...,3
sixes come naturally to this beast,5
Morris the death bowler is dead today,3
"Bruh, how did he hit that?",3
Steyn needs to retire. He’s finished at this level. Let him go out with dignity instead of pulling a dhoni,9
fuck yeah hardik with the bants,3
Big dick unleashed,4
"Pandya to Morris: Look at me, I'm the real all-rounder 



And just as I type this...",9
Did Hardick ask Morris to go and fetch?,5
Hardik you arrogant cunt,7
Last time MI qualified to playoffs in an even year was 2014.,5
Is it too late,0
Is there a better timer of the ball than Hardik?,1
I think MI vs RCB is now a bigger rivalry than MI vs CSK,6
Kuut diye RCB ko,3
Had Ab stayed they would have been chasing 30 more by now,3
Sky smack a six,2
fuccboi gonna finish this now,5
[deleted],30
Pandya jake ball lane ko bol raha hai kya?,2
Taken,2
So this is what swinging the bat feels like for a csk fan,2
The frick they talking??,3
"Hardik as good as a hitter he is, still has some attitude issues",17
Words exchanged. Nice,17
"Man fuck Hardik, such a dick",0
Super over pls,4
bruh drama on the field,3
Now mumbai will deliberately lose to DC on weekend to keep RCB out.,13
Hahaha spicy banter,6
There goes their Fairplay.,17
I trust MI to do 60 in 4 overs rather than 20 in 15,19
The drama in this game is insane my god stop behaving like children everyone,16
Was Hardik saying that to SKY or Morris?,8
Morris lol ... he killed you my man. Don't be a kid and shut the hell up,18
[deleted],-7
Who's Hardik arguing with,9
Slower ball and wicket who would've thought,1
Hahaha fuckboi get rekt,4
Polly kaka to the rescue,2
What's with the sledging? Both teams gonna lose fairplay points. It is childish tbh,3
It takes one bad mouthed Madafaka to shut up Another! (koach),6
Fastest comeback,4
What did hardik say?,11
RIP fairplay award,5
Hit that ugly car.,7
"Man who mouths ""go pick that ball"" gets out the next ball.",12
Wholesome banter :),3
18.5 target achieved. We stay 2nd,6
"Guys, what did Hard Dick say? Did anybody understood?",6
"**18.5** Morris to HH Pandya, OUT,  **158-5**

HH Pandya c Mohammed Siraj b Morris 17 (15b 0x4 2x6) SR: 113.33",4
"*""Ye dekhiye, Pandya bhi behti ganga me haath hi nahi, gaand bhi dho rahe hain""*  

~Kapil Dev  

E: Damn",15
Fuck me what a catch,4
Finally some sledging ...bring it on,7
"this Mumbai team is unfair, 5 wickets down and you still have Pollard coming in",25
fuckboi complaining to Koach lol,5
At the end of tournament Shia lebouf will release a YouTube red documentary on how he fooled all of IPL and Bowled full quota in multiple matches,19
Morris sledging him even after getting pummelled lmao.,34
Wowowow..... Pandya is getting verbal..... Probably nothing serious,8
What is this heat between the players lol.,14
Why are commentators so apologetic these days ? Fair criticism is fine.,17
Send Bumhra next you cowards,11
Brilliant plan from Kohli to make MI lose Fair play points,25
When is Koach gonna grow up lol,13
Spicy,3
What did Hardik say 🍿,9
"Hardik to Morris :
""Tu bas playoff me mil!""",14
[deleted],-1
full gully gameplay here.,6
Pls get this MI,6
Hardik already won them the match with that six anyway,15
RCB needs to fail this year as well. Koach needs to realise that he is a shit captain that needs help with team management.,5
[removed],9
Venkatesh Prasad to Aamir Sohail vibes.,8
"Bruh fuck RCB vs MI is where its at

Pollard vs Starc 2014 was fucking epic",39
MI lost 2 more wickets than what was expected,9
Inb4 Siraj defends the final over.,13
"Ok, the RIFT is real.",13
Biggest unit on the ground now,2
Love to know what was being said there.,7
"Do all players become dicks after coming to rcb (chahal u an angel tho, abd too)",13
Pollard in for overkill,1
"You're a 100 Biryani's too short to challenge our Lord, young grasshopper",2
"I cant understand why they say 'two bites at the cherry', cherries are so small, they'd probably be finished in 2 bites.",1
I think this is why MI think tank keeps pollard back. He can play the pressure situations at the very end excellently,5
LOSING VALUABLE FAIRPLAY POINTS THERE BHENCHOD!!!!!,6
Udana instead of Steyn and we could've won this :(,2
Lol RCB have nothing to celebrate with the game nearly over,2
MI losing the top spot in fairplay award :(,5
Damn I think I'm missing out on so much while I am watching these fucking ads in between overs on Star sports,3
MI Batting line is like free refill of pepsi from taco bell lol,1
There is a certain level of panic in the way Siraj plays his cricket,4
I am still not sure if we can win this,1
Pandya would never have the balls to lip off to Koach.,10
MI can say bye bye to fairplay award.,6
"Ok no matter what happens, I wanna see an RCB vs MI final. There's proper heat between the two.",10
Steyn killed the match. Udana would've been better.,10
Let's get it done Pollard!,5
Proper top of the table clash this,7
We are gonna lose fair play points today. Fuck,14
"Having Pollard come in at 7 is just ridiculous

Absolutely stacked batting order",8
Mi vs rcb is the new rivalry. Koach vs rohit sky hardick,7
Was Hardik getting angry?,6
"If this somehow goes to super over, IPL is 100% scripted.",3
Scenes if Siraj bowls a maiden with a hat trick..,6
Kohli's shockedpickachu face is really enjoyable. Even when he's playing for India it's hard to like him with his retarded celebrations.,10
Pollard v Starc > Hardik v Morris,11
MI we have to win this bois,2
1 six to win from 7 balls,2
"Kohli goes to talk with hardik

r/cricket: Kohli is sledging him, remove him as player, captain, kill him reeeeee",6
Doesnt matter which team they play for in the IPL. I will always love any Indian player giving it back to any foreign player. We have been nice for too long.,10
Polly : *fine i'll do it myself*,13
Who was pandya showing his fingers to,2
IPL brotherhood > Indian Team brotherhood,9
why is Hardik trashtalking Morris?,6
Hard-dick single handedly throwing away the Fair play Award that Ambani paid so much for,22
[deleted],2
[deleted],1
Jaa ball lekar aa Morris,2
"Pollard with sr of 400 already

Goat",2
"Don't Worry, Siraj will bowl the next over and Pollard(🦁) comes at 7 for us",4
Haaat BC well-done. Show em,2
POLLARD IS SCARY,2
"Finally some cricket.

Fuck that sham that is fair play award.",9
I actually enjoy this sledgefest. Fairplay shit is boring,11
"Imma support my man.  Fuck off Morris , chutya madarchod!",-2
Lmao Morris still got smashed after that,2
Game set done,1
That will shut Morris up for good,3
What is this bowling?pathetic👎🏽👎🏽,2
A short snorter to Pollard first up...,2
Cameraman you cunt hahaha,6
Lmao Polly.,3
Let’s goooo,2
Fuck this shit.,3
Theres a rift and rohit isnt even playing,7
thank fuck mumbai doesnt give its fans any heart attacks,10
Morris : Mission failed successfully,8
BIG DADDY Pollard hits BIG DICK FOUR. What a CHAD💦,6
Sky doesn't give s flying fuck just chilling like a boss,5
"and Kohli goes..

*Ben Stokes*",6
Pollard at 7 is too OP,9
Who was pandya arguing with,4
Yes yes fight some more and we will win the fair play award,9
I just hate this Pollard guy every time every fucking time he is there to save the ass of MI,6
What did Hardik say? Anyone could listen?,5
Fuck RCB are back into the match,0
Lol that looked so easy for Pollard,5
[deleted],-1
Pollard is an absolute giant -  what a man,9
Edit : No more goti muh me,5
Kohli is going cry himself to bed tonight...,6
If Siraj defends this the mods need to pin his apology thread.,4
Fking advertisers not even sparing time between balls.. Peak capitalism,6
Look at koach haha deserves it for not pitching in for SKY.,7
Lol Pollie,3
F,3
[deleted],5
Makes sense. SKY will hit the winning shot,5
Kohlis gonna cry,10
Are they gonna bump fists or end up in a fist fight at the end of the game?,12
"SKY to bcci: Thukra ke mera pyaar, mera intekaam dekhegi",4
Will be fitting if sky scores the winning runs,4
RCB bowling is back in form,4
Pollard slaps that away with a 'the fuck did you make me walk all the way for 2 balls' face,16
"Stupid death bowling from RCB, saying this as an MI fan.",5
Are those tears in Kohli's eyes,6
Ben stokes comes out to bat?,3
"POLLARD toh FAULAAD hai.

(Translation: Pollard is made of steel)",3
Now the question is who gets the finisher sky or pollard,1
I am enjoying watching  twat face of Kohli.,6
"RIP RCB. It was nice knowing y'all, guys...",1
What happened with Morris and Pandya?,1
I really hope there is a system for good performing players to question why they are not selected. At this point not selecting suryakumar is just injustice!,1
RCB and MI can kiss their chances of topping the fair play table good bye.,5
Yeah all you need is one bowler to shit the bed,2
Kohli legit look like he bout to cry,2
Lets gooo MI,1
Pollard wasting ZERO time,2
What did Morris say? Hardik only reacted to his comments. No replays.,2
Getting Pollard at to come at the crease after you’ve lost 5 wickets is too op,3
I want Lynn to play in one of the remaining league matches.,1
pollard vs starc was the peak with deva shri ganesha playing in the background for the stadium.,4
Pollard > Abd,-1
Lord siraj gonna defend 3 runs,6
RCB looking to make RCB vs MI new El Classico.,10
lol what a bunch of premature ejac's in RCB team. Meme team for a reason,-1
MI batting depth is insane.,5
Pollard is going to hit the next one for a 7,3
"Pandya Bumrah Another pandya pollard everyone is showing aggression in the field still they are at no.1 in fair play????

still you guys wonder why we say umpires are MI player?!!?!",3
"Mahela: Polly just play the over out and give it to Sky.

Polly: Nah man *Whacks a 4*",9
they managed to take it to the last over somehow,6
INTO THE PLAYOFFs we GOOOO!!,9
Pollard 🤝Pandya,6
So Kohli can only be mad at Sky but too much of a bond with Hardik to say much ?,4
Kohli's almost crying 🥴,2
no offence but RCB look so stupid on the field rn.. tiny dick energy,11
I  want MI to win this just for SKY .,9
Hardik said now my daddy Polly will come and beat your ass,17
Okay. IPL teams need to seriously consider starting a petition to get MI out of the tourney. They sre too op,5
MI might just as well take the trophy home. I don't see any  team who can go toe to toe with this MI side (and they don't even have their best batsman playing)!!,13
SKY <3,6
💦,3
SKY gives zero fucks !,8
[https://gfycat.com/smugincompletedanishswedishfarmdog](https://gfycat.com/smugincompletedanishswedishfarmdog),5
The bowling of the last overs has been atrocious,5
"SKY stunted on Kohli's team, Kohli sledged him also. Still he will never get selected.",9
Fuck the fair play award! We want some spicy ness👍🏽😎,12
Jesus...to everyone saying Kohli is going to cry or Kohli got humiliated. He doesn't care. Calm down.,14
Kohli fans malding rn.,2
Siraj hattrick can take RCB home here.,5
Fuck yeah SKY!! ❤️❤️,12
That's the FUCK YOU from SKY,14
KXIP could have still taken this to super over,11
Chad Suryakumar.,14
Sky for the win,9
Watch Kohli die inside,7
"Bowler: OK I have taken a wicket now let me bowl a good last ball

Last Ball : Full Toss",9
"Honestly, Udana would have done better than Steyn today..",10
DAMN S.K.Y,4
Ok so atleast we keep our net run rate over DC right ?,9
Best celebration ever. Love it,15
That was too classy,14
That Swagger!,12
That looked like a slap to the selectors.,11
Pollard telling Morris not to mess with his boy Harddik.,7
iF sIrAJ dEfEnDs mOdS nEeD tO piN aPoLoGy tHreAd,8
SKY bloody brilliant. What a sledge that was.,10
Surya Kumar you fucking boss. Owned it. 💯,11
Yes surya,5
Sky Masterclass!,2
SKYYYYY 💙💙💙💙,4
Kohli is such a sore loser,3
"AB, Kohli and the middle order let the team down today, especially Koach. This loss is on them.",11
Siraj 5 in 5 ala Amir can take RCB home here.,4
"What's the beef between Hardik, SKY AND rcb?",11
GG S.K.Y,7
LOL @ YADEV,5
damn the bitch im here calm down SKY,12
Lol utter alpha moment for SKY,19
SKY really giving it out there.,6
"You beat us too much MI, but nothing more important than seeing kohlis face like a deflated balloon at the end of the game",11
Indian selectors and captain being embarassed on national tv again.,13
LOL SKY saying main hoon na. RCB owned.,8
Hahahahaha sky just killed them,11
Sky made me a fan tonight. Cool guy and a bigger man.,13
BHENCHOD,5
Was he signaling to Kohli there?,7
Suryakumar teaches Koach what happens when you don't select the right people for the national team.,12
So MI due to their NRR is virtually qualified.,11
"What a brilliant gesture from SKY here, I'm ded. 
I'm Here don't worry ❣❣❣ True King",18
LMAO was he doing that gesture to koach?😂😂,23
Surya Kumar : I'm here to stay (to kohli),17
Even with Pandya going at less than 100 MI chased this easily thanks to SKYs class. Risklessly took MI home .,11
Smooth SKY...very smooth.,8
Fuck those sons of bitches who didn't select Surya for t20. Fuck you bitches for not giving this man this opportunity.,16
Loved SKY gesture after finishing,7
That was a fucking Alpha celebration.,37
[removed],2
"Wish granted, sky hits the winning runs",6
"Lmao thank you Siraj for ending it immediately, but ngl he was actually good apart from the 3 fours over.",8
Pretty dope celebration from SKY,25
Pandya looks like Lothar from Mandrake,7
"Fucking hell, SKY has played an absolute blinder here hasn't he",15
Sky said fucking take that Kohli,10
Kohli is such a sore loser,15
Happy for SKY,11
"Fuck it, finished it in style . Calm as fuck. What a legend Surya Kumar Yadav. Take a bow.",13
Ok.... Mumbai definately losing some Fair play points here,13
dil jeet liya SKY,11
Give dilli sky 😢,5
SKY really said Main hoon na,15
Go SKY!!!!!!!!!!!,6
Lmao. Chad SKY with the calm down while chewing gum.,23
Haha SKY with the ultimate banter,12
Got an eerie feeling rcb will be kicked out of the top 4 lmaoo.,11
Hahahaha Fuck the Fair Play. Never cared about it anyway,14
Alpha SKY with all the Big Dick Energy...,11
This was never a close match because MI never choke. They are not RCB.,19
Who is SKY signalling?,15
SKY only made one mistake today - that butt ugly soul patch,15
Damn SKY. The SWAG!,11
Love love love this MI squad!,17
Perfect ending by SKY. Fuck the selectors,25
Can't lie that was some King shit from SKY,24
Had multiple orgasms on SKYs revenge knock. Can easily be the most watched video on pornhub.,11
Bruht the drama is too much,12
I want the confidence in life that SKY has while batting. Such a Classy player.,18
That's the way to finish it. Innings to remember.,5
Man Kohli and Morris look like such chutiyas after mouthing off so much in this match. SKY just silenced them,29
"*3 required off 6*

Good Samaritan Siraj gifts a boundary off the first ball",12
ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ SKY (っ.❛ ᴗ ❛.)っ,6
Mumbai is so op that somebody who can play in the team just on the basis of his batting is coming at 5 down,6
Sky is a fucking masterclass. That's how you respond to sledging.,14
Even Yadav's cockiness is understated,19
"His gesture at the end was so adorable. 

Winning hearts with that.",38
"Qualifier 1 and Finals in Dubai

MI : *chuckles, i’m in danger*",5
"Sorry, but, Who the fuck keeps picking Steyn?",13
Another 20 runs and this wud have been interesting,1
"Surya Kumar ""I am here"" Yadav.",10
SKY - Main Hoon Na,5
Happy for SKY but still dead inside :/,7
SRH please thrash us like DC in next game,12
Suryakumar: 🤫,12
MI looking unstoppable,4
Koach deserves that shit lmao. What a statement by SKY,8
Hahaha SKY rubbing it in the Koach,7
KOHLI IS A SHIT CAPTAIN.,12
SKY 💦💦💦💦,5
"Kohli Shashtri and selectors can do one. 

Fuck yourselves assholes. 


Well don't Surya, he had time perform today after non selection",15
Why is he called sky?,5
"what a cunt lolhli literally is, did not even appreciate SKY's knock",24
"Really feel bad for SKY, dude has performed better than atleast 4-5 ppl named in the selected squad",10
"Two things I'd like to change on our lineup:

- Boot Tiwari out. He's trash.

- Play NCN instead of Pattinson imo. More consistent bowling, and gives us even more batting depth so top/middle order can play more aggressively.",2
This sub shit talks about other social medias and proceeds to do the same thing here.,7
So siraj did get accepted to dinda academy (lel no offense),9
Arrogance on mumbai players really shows,3
Sky's most identifying facial feature was his beards now it is slightly harder to recognize him,4
That reaction at the end. SKY you rockstar.,9
"Apparently only icc knockout runs count lads

Better let international cricketers know runs in bilateral series don't count. Don't need to score in group stage games either, only the knockouts",6
Good game. Both DDP and SKY were superb today,6
"Haha cheeky Cricinfo, mentioning Steyn instead of Siraj for the last boundary",4
Poor SKY he cant make it to Indian team untill Koach retires.,6
Brilliant from SKY. Jeez the swagger was off the charts.,4
Can we get a 'fuck the selection committee' thread going in honour of SKY,14
Kohli is such a sore loser lol. Didn’t even say anything while passing SKY.,15
SKY showing the Indian captain why he should have been picked. I love it!,8
SKY having a perfect day,4
at least we are still in the top 2,2
Yeah MI in top 2 trophy confirmed,2
CR7?,2
"Surya still did not act like an asshole after all that has happened, what a player",16
Sky gave a deserving fucking to bc Kohli,8
Sky the limit for SKY.,8
Knock Knock RCB ka baap aaya 😂,14
I can’t wait to see the aggression when rcb and srh play together with Virat and Warner,11
What was surya trying to say after scoring winning shot?,9
SKY giving off a cool guys don't look at explosions vibe there,16
"Damn, Steyn unfortunately has lost his mojo. Each time he gets game time he loses his nerve. Maybe they need to stick with him until he gets it back? Too late in the tourney I'm afraid.

His overs lost them the match. And their batting tbh.",7
Pollard changed the game with his bowling,16
They should have just selected him to avoid his wrath,16
Thoughts on linking fairplay points to match fees and tournament prize money as percentage multiple?,2
Lmao SKY with that swagger. Absolute madman.,14
How does India not pick SKY? He's one of the best striker around,6
"Man, Surya just emanates cool at the moment. 

Was a trip seeing him come up the ranks in KKR, great to see him continue with MI.",15
Who was SKY gesturing to? Dugout?,6
Those great learning ads not doing Kohli any favours,6
Sky is a Top lad,7
Bruh tapori hardik vs dilli se hi bc virat would be fun,6
It's amazing how SKY can walk around this non-chalant considering he's carrying around balls of steel!,10
"Yeah I still think Udana in place of Steyn should've been the change I mean Steyn hasn't played a match for almost month, and Udana takes wickets, not to mention the oh so glorious slower balls! Ffs I'm so mad",9
Yep. That’s how you answer your haters.,7
"Surya's celebration is soooo over powered man..
Couldnt think of anything better than ""Tera bhai hai naaa""💪",14
MoM: Steyn,3
"Retain:
Bumrah
Rohit
Hardik

RTM on:
Pollard
Surya

Maybe Kishan for Polly if they're looking at the future.",5
Teams are so shit even Delhi might deserve to make the playoffs lol.,4
Sky with the boss move at the end,7
"I'm watching the star sports stream, and where have I seen the guy in the HDFC advertisement?",2
"If you had any brains, you would add him to the squad after tonight. But the ego must have been hurt so its not going to happen.",15
FUCK we missed out the second spot by 0.02 points fuck me.,12
Lodu Lalit,9
"SKY answering the doubters the best way one can, by smacking them silly.",8
"surya : main hoon na.

*srk shivering in fear.*",20
WIll be interesting to see what Kohli has to say in the post-match interview.,5
[deleted],1
SKY BOLTEEE!!,3
"MI team really getting cocky against Koach. Selection beef? Lmao, SKY's action was gold though.",17
"Damn, how are MI not supposed to win the IPL now? The only thing that can stop them is a freakish individual performance like what Stokes did.",18
"Moral victory for taking it to the final over, match was closer than I expected.",15
SKY: I let my bat do the talking,14
SKY made my day more than MI winning the game.,27
"With a nrr of 1.25, it's very difficult to maintain, even when u r winning",13
Tiwary looks so out of place in Mumbai playing 11. Literally every other player has almost won a match for them single handedly,14
"Now Kolhi will go out and give his usual ""we were 30 runs short"" excuse. Yeah, we were, because you ruined the momentum of the game when you came out to bat..",44
Biggest Fuck Yous to Kohli I've seen,23
"As much as I wanted RCB to win, well done SKY. He got shat on by the selectors quite hard, making them regret it",10
SKY made a  big statement more than a match winning innings today. Love his attitude.,23
I have a feeling that RCB is not making it to the playoffs,13
"Any time I think ok maybe I can like MI a bit as a csk fan, I just take one look at Hardik Pandya and his on field antics, and I'm back to square one.",7
SKY is here to stay.,12
How tf does srh have the second highest nrr with only 5 wins??,14
Surya you deserve better than those bitch ass selectors.,20
Lol did you guys see how Kohli didn't even shake hands properly with SKY?,26
This was a statement game from SKY after getting hosed by the BCCI. Exactly what I was hoping Pant to do but Pant is off form.,55
What swag!,3
[deleted],-3
Main hu na... SKY is amazing,10
Imagine India absolutely shitting in Australia without rohit and sky.,13
Did MI NRR decrease?,11
Man this guy deserved a spot in that Australia tour but now that he fked with koach he will never play,17
*Normies (MI) fight for the top spot to get two chances to go to final. Me and my homies (RCB and DD) compete for third spot to advance into eliminator*,20
Fuckin hell a fired up MI is no good news for the rest of the teams,20
fuck the selection committee,14
"There is absolultely no way Surya is not retained. So Rohit, Surya, Bumrah, Pandya and Pollard will be Top 5. They will have to bid for Ishan Kishan and others in auction.",20
"If we dont qualify this season, Kohli should drop captaincy plis🙏(i know it ain't happening)",12
"What did sky signal ? i missed it, any replay anywhere?",4
"Someone earlier said they want sky's wicket to see Kohli celebrate. 

Damn am I glad I saw sky win it and his ""Don't worry folks, am still here"" celebration.",49
"MI won the match even without Rohit, RIFT™ confirmed!",12
What's up with Pandya always looking pissed ?,13
Most Toxic match of this year's IPL?,20
Kohli is not best guy for captain. Some people like to quote his win stats but I will say that he will never win any big ICC tournament because he always screws up in big moments,14
Sky didn't looked troubled one bit by any bowler... Fitting to perform against Kohli & RCB.,17
Being second on the table still doesn't seem safe for rcb. Lol,8
FUCK YEAH SKYYYYY,4
Suryakumar Yadav’s demeanour after that winning shot has legend written all over it.,30
Pollard is an absolute unit.,3
"RCB letting their guard down, changing the team left and right, losing that balance they had initially. I'm not even sure if they would make to the play offs at this rate.",8
It would be great to see SKY against Australia....oh wait a second.,18
"SKY is just too cool! Taking Kohi's stare head-on, playing at ~200 SR playing elegant shots, Showing a middle finger to the selectors by finishing the game...",51
Pollard's belly showing up hahahaha :P,8
SKY showing Kohil how good he is,10
SKY you my man bro! Just kill these fuck ass bitches and take the playoffs and the finals.,10
Kohli with the 20 runs short lmaooo,8
20 runs short. I am now satisfied.,6
SMH commentators shying away from any criticism of the BCCI selectors for failing to select SKY,5
Reckon r/cricket will kill koach today if given a chance,10
He said it. He said the thing. 20 runs short.,8
Siraj and koach setting up the field and I’m like why bro it’s gonna be over in 1 ball. Jo try karna tha wo pehele karna tha ab koi fayda nahi.,13
"20 runs short lol 
I'd say 40-50 considering its MI",16
Bishop Should ask kohli about skys selection,4
"He said the magic words lads, 20 runs short. Upvotes to the left",16
That innings by SKY had BOSS written all over it.,9
The 20 run short non-sense will never stop,5
Le 20 runs short!,9
[deleted],-23
RCB deeply missed Saini,5
SKY daddy being a daddy😳😳😳,3
20 rUnS sHoRt^(TM),8
[deleted],1
Unfortunately we won't see Sky anytime soon in Indian colors.,7
Highly doubt we’ll go to the playoffs this way 😭,10
"RCB on a losing spree ?

If this was any other year/edition of the IPL, I would have backed them to crumble.

But hey, it's 2020 and wierd things have happened already.",8
Virat 'we were 20 runs short' Kohli,13
"Why SKY is not selected.
The selectors gone mad",6
Anti-Kohli circlejerk in full force,8
Ask about SKY,3
"Sala Yeh dukh kahe khatam nahi hota :( 

Well Played MI and Sky you played fabulous today!",7
Lol. If only Kohli and Morris showed that aggression in playing instead of sledging other guys.,11
Why is everyone taking a dig at Koach for not selecting Sky? Does IPL define that you'll definitely get selected in Internationals. Also he isn't a selector.,7
How did we overlook Sky for the Australia series? Braindead selectors.,16
This SKY innings is a slap on a face still time left call emergency selector meeting,14
NRR decreased :(,11
I'd pick Suryakumar over Shreyas Iyer anyday.,16
Why does it seem like Sky is honestly dejected that he wasn't picked for the australian tour.,16
This match  gives us direction : Two wins and straight to playoffs.,10
Unpopular opinion:   Players like Sky and Ishan Kishan should be given a chance in the international cricket. At least one of them. Why they were not in the squad until now is baffling!,1
Difference between Sky and Pant. Both had a chance to prove a point and sometimes I feel it was right to drop pant,9
pollard with that stomach probably looks like asking buffet main kya hai to pandya.,13
Does Kohli have a say in tour selections?,13
RCB has problems. MI has solutions. That is the difference between these two sides.,24
"He knew there would be swing with the new ball and still didn’t bowl siraj, how hard is it?????",9
What was SKYs celebration afte winning?,5
"Suryakumar “Why isnt he selected for India” Yadav, long lost cousin of Sanju “Why isnt he playing for India” Samson",4
"Really don’t mind if MI win this year, SKY got me pumped. As a Mumbaikar, it feels good to have finally discovered the great spirit of this team. Still love my meme team Rajasthan though",28
It would perfect if the final was rcb vs mi. Can see some great banter,8
"Yup, screen-recording that gesture by SKY  at the end",10
"I don't know if it was Main Hoon Na.

It felt to me like "" You know what, I'll stay here winning matches for my team in this blue jersey""",25
"Honestly I thought Kohli had matured, why pick on a 30 year old uncapped player lol?",32
"RCB really needs to start picking Parthiv, make AB field instead of keep, get Morris and Ali playing together and have Udana as the fourth overseas guy. 

Stop picking players where you have good Indian alternatives. Start shoring up your lower middle order.",7
"i am coming from cricinfo, whats going on between kohli and sky?",15
when will he stop with the 20 RuNs ShOrT. goddamn sore loser,11
Heart wrenching loss this.I was thinking this might be the game where we show our class but fucking Mumbai are at it again.,13
Koach indirectly saying Steyn cost them the game,15
20 runs short because 7(13) should have been 27(13),17
"They way sky plays is much more important than his records. The shots are safe, the sixes are clean. He finds gaps and plays according to the field placement. What more do you fucking want?",33
Honestly the presenters should Kohli why Suryakumar Yadav is ignored,22
Kohli is an arrogant cunt,28
Fucker didn’t say a single word about SKY after being hopelessly outclassed by him .,45
Pollard is too fucking valuable as a player. Insane hitter very handy bowler and outstanding fielder. Honestly believe Mumbai should retain Rohit Bumrah Pollard because he’s only 33 rn and Hardik isn’t bowling. We can use RTM for him,41
[deleted],19
Post match convos amongst the lads are so wholesome,23
Lol Koach taking a dig and smirk at CSK,11
Toxicity at 50% and rising,20
Vk ain't good as a person,4
Why are they not asking about the little spat ... disappointing from Bish,20
SKY needs to be in Australia man. BCCI needs to fix this.,19
What was the drama? Can anyone tell those who doesn't know?,16
Hard core RCB fan for 13 years but I'm not too disappointed because I'm so happy for SKY,29
Why have Dube and not bowl him at all? Steyn was expensive. At least try something different. Play another spinner maybe. Sometimes you feel like Kohli is giving away a match without trying all options.,27
[deleted],23
Why is this sub so anit-my_fav_player? Why can't you guys always praise who I like? This blows.,17
What were these softies bish where is danny morrison.,10
[deleted],26
"If RCB being RCB wasn't enough, they now have a truckload of South African players. Looks like they're looking forward to BLACKED level Choke^TM",34
LOL Simon Doull quoting Main Hoon Na,21
"Not every mumbai player will make into national team, stop crying about it.",-5
I just can't wait to see sky coming to rr after the next auction,-4
"Kohli bullied surya on the field with his words, and Surya answered that with his bat, what a player",23
"DC team reaction to non selection: We'll prove the selectors right.
Mi team reaction to non selection: Bounderies go brrr",35
No mention of SKY in the post match speech.,12
I can def see us choking after these two losses in a row,15
Just think if we get an RCB vs mi final.,14
Koach ki bolti band,2
Same shit done by another guy and r/cricket would shit on him all day,11
"Kohli : They played well (in regards with mi batting)

Bruh, Atleast now that the match is over, acknowledge Sky in particular maybe ?",27
Well SKY might never play for India if he’s rubbed off wrong with some people but he’s bound to get a big pay day in the next IPL auction.,49
[removed],27
Lol still no team has qualified and only 1 team is disqualified.,17
What is Dube doing in the team? RCB is essentially playing with 10 men,22
MI vs RCB >>>> MI vs CSK,44
Sky has just couple of shots and one of them is to sweep every ball. And number 3 is available position now,-2
What RCB is still 2nd?,6
"Look at how chill opposing team members are with each other. Tell me if it doesn't look weird, If this thing was not fixed why would there be such camaraderie between winning and losing team.",-22
"Honestly who cares if Kohli is a dick on the field. Gets the runs which is all that matters.

People with talent often have big personalities which people commentating always question. But hey that big competitive personality is why he is playing the match and we are watching.",0
Why has Mi not confirmed qualified yet?,9
"If we go to Australia and have that stupid motherfucking ""where is our no. 4"" discussion while losing games out of our asses, I am going to break something.

Fuck the selectors. We have enough talent in India and it is your fucking responsibility to make sure talented players are given chances. SKY should be going to Australia, there is no argument against it, except maybe that the cost of the airline ticket is too high.",35
"Ootl what's between kohli and sky, I thought the banter was between hp and Morris?",20
"Dirty Politics by Kohli and Bcci, not considering Surya. Burn in hell",6
why is everyone mad at koach’s post match presentation here? Am I missing something?,6
My brother watching Trent Boult for first time and he is shocked to see this nice a guy for that name. How did I never notice this lmao.,12
"If DC or RCB lose one of their two matches, isn’t there a chance for KXIP to go to 2nd position with NRR?",8
"Reckon r/cricket want every fucking player in the team

Guys there can only be 15 in the squad not 100",10
"Overall I'd say we put up a good fight with Saini not available, middle order needs to start firing if they want the top 2",9
Steyn should ve been selected much earlier so that his comeback would ve been out of the options 😉,6
"I need a SKY apology thread to apologize on behalf of BCCI. His innings is such a delight to watch, imo a no rash shot inning in t20 is so rare. We are sorry you were ditched SKY.",21
"Y'all can complain about RCB's batting and management all you want but they'll always be and play like such a meme with a bowling attack that is hot trash... you got Inverse Thala Jesus Wank Steyn, Udana Stock Slower Ball, Mohammad Unlethal Syringe, Chris Two-Dots-Three-Pies Morris.

Ain't gonna win anything having to pray that your bowlers don't leak boundaries for \~10 overs every game",23
"Mumbai lobby is at it again in the thread,  where is srikanth when u need him",2
"r/cricket: Koach is cunt

Meanwhile Aussies: Can we have him?",14
OH MY GOD HOW HAVEN'T I NOTICED IT YET WHERE HAS KEVIN PIETERSEN BEEN I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM SINCE A LONG TIME,11
MI batting is out of form a little bit apart from Surya. COuld be a concern if chasing big targets or setting bigf scores.,8
Chin up King Kohli,7
Isuru Udana has done nothing wrong to be replaced by Dale Steyn.,43
This was so much fun to watch ngl,3
"The biggest blockbuster finals would be rcb vs Mumbai, there might be a few punches thrown.",5
How did MI's run rate decrease wth?,9
Yup got it. Sky isnt in national team cause of vk. VK  slegded him which means he doesnt likes sky which means he was the reason why sky isnt selected.,15
"After getting a snub ...coming up with performance like
 this against team lead by india captain ( arrogant india captain i should say ) is job well done SKY...
Now if they don't pick you to fix their fragile middle order issues  , their loss.

M pretty sure the day rohit gets white ball captaincy ( full time ) , sky walks into the team.

Behind the scenes things aren't looking good for india blues.",8
Saini is also missed.. remember the super over,3
the Kohli - Surya stare off was really something.,14
"So many toxic people here in r/cricket

Reckon they will start simping for Kohli again when he plays for india

Remember 2018 when whatever shit Kohli did was praised like he was the greatest fucking guy ever, here",6
Bumrah too op plz nerf🥺😞😞,14
"Did people here never see people, with a personality slightly bigger than a piece of toilet paper, playing games before? Good lord",2
So once again tomorrow is KKR vs Rest of India?,15
Will motm be Bumrah or sky?,5
"BRUHHHH I'm rooting for a CSK win tomorrow
C'mon THALA !!!!!",10
Anyone know this female anchor's name? ... for science,13
Figuratively literally.,3
[removed],2
Post match commentator should have man’d up and ask Kohli about SKY not in Indian squad.,15
want kohli to take this attitude and go guns blazing next game,4
People here think Captain has no say in the Squad. Absolute BS. This is BCCI we are talking about.,11
You gotta believe in rebirth just look at Boult he was an eagle last birth.,6

"I want RCB Vs MI in both Q1 and the finals, such drama much wow",9

Young Bumrah And Koach🥺,13

"Must've been a difficult one for Koach tonight, SKY with that brilliant innings and Bumrah getting him as his 100th wicket. Bumrah sure earned some bragging rights.",11
Swann has the balls to say Kohli put pressure on the team.,17
Kohli didn't even praise sky for his performance in post match which all captains do. Surely its his vindictive nature which is preventing sky selection,12
Give SKY the spot on the Indian Team. Please.,4
Kohli got burned for staring directly at Surya.,15
chutia hotstar cut the spicy bits from HL wtf,8
"I personally don’t think there’s any internal “politics” behind non selection of SKY. It’s just that as far as batsmen are concerned, the slots are packed in the T20 side. Even the “mercurial finisher whatever” Pant couldn’t find a place in the side. Maybe there are fair cases to pick SKY over Pandey/Iyer in the T20I side, they themselves have been waiting in the line for their chances when guys like Rayudu and Pant were getting their chances.

If Iyer fails in T20s and Pandey is unimpressive, SKY is next in the line. It’s unfair for SKY, but that’s how it is I think",18
"Let Kohli swim in sea with Anushka in afternoon and have BBQ in night. Let guy enjoy, dont put pressure of RCB on him.",3

Ask something spicy Harsha,2
It is hard to see a player like Steyn who I admire so much perform badly. I guess good players should also be able to say goodbye at the right time.,9
Hope Kohli carries this aggression into the next match and fucking Ben stokes himself into form like he did Vs WI a while back. Angry Kohli is best Kohli,8
MI fans pissed at Koach for not including Sky is deserving not toxicity. How do you exclude a player like that?,13
Reminder that IPL is Mickey Mouse competition and performance does not translate to international level.,-7
"This sub hates King Kohli.

*Proceeds to write fuck you Kohli comment*",-7
Anyone got a video of Koach sledging SKY??,8
Don't think the match was too toxic or something. Good aggressive cricket. Well played SKY and Bumrah. Gg MI,5
SKY is so cute🥺😔,6
Surya just went back 5 years with that shave,13

I hope harsha asks surya about what happened in the middle and what he thinks why he is uncapped.,10
I swear Mumbai Indians fans are literal hellspawn,-25
This subreddit is creating too much drama around Kohli and Surya Kumar. Bet Kohli doesn't give two shits about this guy after the day.,9
Surya bagging all the awards 💙💙💙,18
I hope Surya continues to do well and win IPL for MI. He wont be ignored next time around.,26
"Madarchod star doesn't let you rewind, I missed the stare off",16
"Kohli should've mentioned SKY's innings in his speech but didn't do so because he is still in the heat of the moment. Not excusing him because he is too experienced to be doing this stuff at 31, but I am sure he will congratulate him later once things are cooled down. I remember SKY calling Kohli GOAT once and either way Virat is not petty enough to keep today's events from selecting SKY for Indian team in future.",57
RCB really needs Saini,14
[deleted],7
Why the fuck people are comparing Sky with VK? I understand that he is really good player and deserves the place but in no way he is better than Koach! Don't get this toxic he is the same fucking guy who have scored 70 international tons and he almost the same age of Sky so need any more explanation?,-7
So the Indian fans will hate their best batsman over some chump who can’t even make the team /s.,13
"Damn, even Pollard talking about him🥺🥺👍🏽",42
"Pollard putting in a word for SKY, wholesome",57
"The threads nowadays are soo fucking passive aggressive. Either shitting on a player having a hard time and then worshiping the same bloke if he hits a couple of sixes. Maybe test cricket threads would be better than IPL ones, same people shitting on social media. Thought here would be more true fans of the game rather than these social media bullshitters.",18
"If ABD doesn't fire, this team would lose almost all the matches.",14
"seeing steyn like this brings the mood down.
Its like a slow drag now to a military medium pacer.",16
16 points still not qualified for the playoffs what the hell?,7
So no words exchanged between Kohli and SKY. Just a stare.,17
"Mods, just rename this thread to RCB crying fans thread. Lmao
They finna talk about SKY and vk every now and then now.",22
Thank you Pollard for reminding he hasn't been picked yet! SKY needs to be in the Indian side!,43
"If someone is watching unofficial streams, please try to record moments like these, because Star never shows them in the highlights package",18
I understand Suryakumar has been really good this season and he's a quality cricketer but comparing him with Kohli? That's taking it too far!,4
Kohli literally just talks abt what luck didnt go rcbs way and didnt even mention how SKY took the game away from them...,48
After not bowling for years Pollard has been servicable this season. Especially today.,22
"Sky played well, but bumrah deserved MOM. He pulled the match to MI side",24
"Lol what a fall for RCB fans, from comparing VK to AB, to now comparing VK to SKY",21
[deleted],-11
"Surya needs to keep going. I think If Iyer and Pandey don't grab the middle order spots in Australia, he will get his opportunity. I hope he gets some time before wt20 though. No one wants another 3d saga.",23
Pollard always maintains the bro code.,36
Ewww what is that on skys face,-30
Pollard is a wholesome leader tbh,37
"Nobody comparing SKY with VK Bois, it's just a fact that BCCI SELECTION PROCESS suxx.",49
People who hate Kohli are now finally getting their moment to shine.,-3
"Come on Harsha, don't bottle the international call up question.",12
Dil chahta hai mustache is the key i am telling you.,16
this thread so toxic it can be used as harpic.,29
SKY a sweetie,12
So 30 yo Sky who haven't even debuted in International level is better than Virat the guy who scored 70 tons at the same age? Really the hate is getting beyond understanding,8
Script writers wrote a win for KKR tomorrow to make things interesting,8
looks like Suryakumar is gonna get a wildcard entry to the Indian team. Lol,20
"So much toxicity in the thread lmao, and I do mean from both sides just to be clear... How about just discuss the game and refrain from the death threats yeah?",22
To everyone saying SKY's IPL performance doesn't warrant a national selection - we have a player who got selected based on ONE bowling spell,45
[removed],-9
"MI needs to beat DC too so that they can be secure about their top spot. Considering the Qualifier-1 is on Thursday and their last league game against SRH is on Tuesday, they can rest SKY, Pollard,  Bumrah to manage the workload. Of course, this has nothing to do with me being a supporter of SRH.",19
SKY IS WAAY BETTER THAN KOHLI IN T20'S CHECK STAT,-28
"Sky good

Kohli bad 

Now give me my gold",-30
It appears Surya can bowl as well. That makes him super valuable as few indian batsmen are bowling these days. I am keeping fingers crossed Surya is given a run soon in Indian team. This knock by Surya is at KL level when he is on flow. Easy and effortless.,24
"The problem is Surya bats at 3. No 3 in India is Koach. He cant open because there's Dhawan Rohit and Rahul. But I think he could come in at 5 or 6 easy. Should be there in reserves at least. Theres just too many batsmen in India all of a sudden now,.",16
"No. 5, 6 and 7:
Dube, Mann and Morris vs. Polly and the Pandyas. Moreover, Steyn and Siraj to bowl at them at the death? Yeah you are losing this more often that not. 

Also, really happy for SKY!!",18
Okay missed the match for last 10 mins. What happened between VK and SKY?? Did kohli sledge or what?,4
"I keep seeing comments about MI supporters saying Suryakumar is better than Kohli but I haven't seen a single MI supporter say that here so far


Edit: nvm found one",25

What a bad fucking day to be an rcb and a die hard koach fan lol,27
"Imagine rcb not winning this time as well..and there is an option to replace koach with kl Rahul as captain ..

The same rcb fans might go full on bashing of koach.

Deep down they know it's not about poor bowling only over the years for rcb failures but poor man management and leadership.

Would love to see kumble , Rahul and co.  In top 4.",14

"The toxicity in this sub is a major reason why I don't any particular circlejerk, jeez 12 year olds have a better conversation having different opinions",24
"Before Kohli sledges another batsman, he should remember he has bowlers like Siraj & Steyn in his team 😭",40
"No one here is comparing sky to vk lmao. Sky deserved to be in the squad and people are just calling out that. As for toxicity, Koach sledging a player who was already down having not been selected even after performing better than his peers is such a low blow.",48
mcCleanaghan with that cheeky you look good in blue tweet.,20
India needs an all rounder coach or a wk coach who understands all aspects of the game because Kohli’s guy decisions are dogshit,17
For someone who is considered as Goat he is big pussy,18
"similar to last game bad target and no hiccups during the second innings smooth sailing atleast this time MI slowed down liiitttlee bit, last game was just smooth sailing for CSK (2nd innings)",9

Wait i missed post match.  What happened?,4
Any reason why udana didnt play ..he did well in the couple of games he played ..injured ??,4
Love seeing egos get crushed,18
Surya kumar Yadav crushed Kohli’s ego in classic way https://twitter.com/sfcunity/status/1321503815971999744?s=21,20
I hope India loses badly in the upcoming limited overs tour in Australia. Enough of these politics and shitty selections.,6
"Matthew Vaughan said something beautiful on cricbuzz that any player that's not been picked, your only job is to embarrass the selectors and continue to do that until you are selected.",44
okay enough of koach vs sky let's talk about morris vs pandya,15
"It pains me to see Suryakumar Yadav NOT being selected atleast in the T20 side for the Australian tour. He exactly showed the captain of Team India what He's missing out on by putting on a masterclass and taking his side home against his team. He has a shot for every ball, an answer for everything that is thrown at him.He plays shots all around the ground. He genuinely doesn't looks like a bowler will be able to get him out when he's on song. He plays the field like a magician and has the ability to hit any gap you provide him with on the field. A true 360° player. And the determination he showed today was testament to how much he would be hurting inside. What more he has to do?",29
I like this RCB MI rivalry till CSK makes a comeback. Too much wholesomeness causes toothache.,21
"People supporting SKY selection for india blues T20 side aren't saying because of this game only , this guy has been performing well consistently...
Plus no one is looking to compare sky vs kohli , won't be fair to kohli the batsman..he is legend.

India team has a known weakness after 1,2,3 ..good that Iyer has shown some promise but what if either of Iyer and pandey is out of touch ...sky is a viable alternative who can bat anywhere from 3 to 6 and he bats with a good strike rate as well.

If there is a better middle order batsman to put in reserve or backup , m all ears to know about him .",35
A lot of folks consider a normal conversation between Delhi folks as toxic behaviour on this subreddit lol.,16
"Super off topic but what happened to the only comparison to bumrah i.e. Mustafizur Rahman, wtf happened to him.",8
"I'm convinced the vast majority of people here have never played any competitive sport in their life. On field aggression literally has zero effect on personal dynamics between players off the field. Kohli's 'antics' are nothing to be outraged about. It's so banal. People except VK to behave like Sachin/Dravid but he is a different kind of personality. Remember people lost their shit when Dhoni was caught saying bsdk idhar daikh le? On field aggression is not the equivalent of arrogance. And ffs, there is no grand conspiracy by Kohli to keep SKY or other MI players out of the Indian team",27
"Does anyone find it weird that there are 4 spinners(Chahal, Jadeja, Sundar, Chakravarthy) in the 16 man T20 squad for Australia where typically pitches aren't conducive for spin bowling? They could have literally added a middle order batsman or a fast bowler, considering Chahal and Jadeja will 99.9% in the playing 11 since Chahal is the main spinner & Jadeja can bat too & makes no sense to have 2 more spin bowling choices for a 3 match series!",7
"People here acting like Kohli should have got down on his knees and apologised to SKY lol

Koach's bowlers were getting their asses handed to them so he tried the next best thing, getting into the batsman's mind. Good on SKY for coming out as the winner here but this was a high stakes game and people are acting as if Koach has never done this before. He's done the stare down and walking up thing millions of times. Pollard can sledge Virat as much as Virat can sledge SKY as much as Hardik can sledge Morris. 

""Stature"" doesn't matter when you're in the field. This is also why it's annoying to hear people whine about players cursing, like when Rohit said BC a couple of games ago and insta was all like Virat se seekha hai (learnt it from Virat)

That being said, I loved the reply SKY gave but it's annoying to hear how Virat should've kissed his feet or even go easy on him due to the Australia thing. Not like Virat didn't first bump SKY or something, that would've been an indication of something deeper than on field banter.",24
"I am supporting MI (see my comment history) but the bashing Koach received was way way way over the top.

Like I mean yea he didn't specifically say Surya played well during Presentation but he isn't obliged to do so, stop crying over it.

As much as you want to believe Virat conspired with selectors to keep Surya out, no that didn't happen. Selectors have fucked up earlier as well in selecting wrong players. 
FWIW, Ravi Shastri on Twitter praised Surya right after the match but according to r/Cricket he is Kohli's man so why would he ask
 for Surya's inclusion ?

As far as the on field things are concerned, it didn't even escalate to anything. Just a bit of stares and Koach  pressurising him in a tight contest. I mean worst things have happened on field and this wasn't it. All in the game.

Remember peeps, IPL will be over in another 2 weeks ;)

Kohli wouldn't have made it this far if held a grudge against everyone.",20
Is there a petition to get SKY onto the Indian team?,6
"Good to see that SKY has changed his attitude towards the game. He seems a lot more chilled out now on the field. Not the SKY who used to  get into behaviour problems with the MCA. 

From once being considered a journemam in IPL, he has come a long way. Never thought he would receive such support and backing for Indian Team.

 Definitely gonna rock in future seasons (Hopefully for MI :P). If not retained before Mega auctions, he is gonna laugh his way to the bank and he surely deserves it. 

We will be seeing him in the Indian team soon and hopefully for the Australian Tour itself",14
"The all-round excellence of Suryakumar Yadav has been a treat to watch. Interesting that **he talked about meditation to get over the hot-headed image he had acquired**. Whatever the reason, he is playing the best cricket of his life.
