Hmm. Looks like I'm gonna have to be the first one in a match thread,1
"Clash of the two teams with most weird and redundant names.. Mumbai INDIANS vs Delhi CAPITALS

Also the most likely table toppers.. bring it on.",11
"A win today for MI would put them at the top of the table, at least till Wednesday comfortably. A loss today would push them down to 3rd tomorrow.

MI have a winning percentage more than 50% against every IPL team. Against Delhi capitals, it's 50% exact (12 wins 12 losses)",7
Mumbai Indians vs Rahane's team since 2017: **1 win and 7 losses.** The only win was the 2017 IPL Final,1
I'd pay anything to watch Pant belt Pandya and Bumrah around the park like last time.,3
Lmao I am hyped for this match since I woke up today knowing fully well how comfortably we will choke,8
"I'm amazed how Delhi is the only team on equal terms with Mumbai head to head. Despite the shit teams we've had over the years

Just something about Mumbai riles up DD/DC competitiveness lol. Delhi vs Mumbai thing",14
"I really want to see pant getting it right today. He's been trying so long. Hope he'll be able to recreate the kingfisher jingle in this game at least. 

oh la la la oh le o",5
"Mumbai Indians have exact same win loss pattern as they had in 2019 - LWLWWW

In 2019, they lost their 7th game against Rahane's team (RR). A big plus for Delhi today, coz MI take their streaks seriously (else there was no way they'd have lost against CSK)",9
"The first match DC played vs KXIP literally changed the fate of both the teams

If only KXIP had managed to win it, they just needed 1 from 3, probably the points table would have been a lot different",7
Delhi should be winning this comfortably,-2
Looking forward to Jayant Yadav getting a game ahead of Rahul Chahar today. Too many left handers in the DC lineup today,0
My money is on MI,0
"**MI vs DC**: Last 3 years, have a 3-3 record against each other

Lezzooo, hoping it's not a snoozefest",4
Wonder how many times they'll show the Rohit Iyer Mutual Fund ad today,3
"Brian Lara asking who will win tonight in his IG?

Me an intellectual: The team batting first!",3
Whoever bats first will win. Match will be decided in 10 minutes,3
Hotstar showing stream will start soon. Where do I watch the toss?,0
Oh yeahhhhhh!!!!,0
Fuck we're chasing. Gonna be difficult with Rabada in the death.,1
Pant injured ffs noo,5
"Okay guys quick rundown, how is Carrey in T20s?",1
Rohit playing his 150th IPL match for MI.,1
"When you gotta watch 2 matches at a time :P

https://i.imgur.com/I90ZjDh.jpg",2
"I consider this a win- win situation, Carey and Rahane get game time and our batting hasn't gotten significantly weaker.",4
Pant injured kill me now üò≠,7
"Congratulations DC, you won the toss and chose to win",11
"Fuckkkk, Pant is not playing. He is in my fantasy league",2
[deleted],0
Delhi slightly ahead imo since they're batting first,2
CLASH OF TITANS!!!,6
Shit I don‚Äôt know if I should watch this match or Roland Garros,3
2 untested players in a big match? I think MI have it in the bag,5
Rahane in for Hetty? Welp. DC going back to its brain-dead ways.,-10
Nooo wanted Pant to shit talk Pollard and Pandyas,9
Rahane is Mumbai's kryptonite,4
Did iyer give any reason why hetmyer isn‚Äôt playing?,1
M I D C game certainly needs an away jersey though both are playing away,2
I fancy MI‚Äôs chances. Pant has done well against Bumrah previously and him missing a game is definitely beneficial.,1
What happened to Pant? Nice to see that my boii Rahane is playing,7
I‚Äôll miss Pant‚Äôs energy behind the stumps,0
Just gonna put this here: we lost this match because we weren't at a 100% with pant and hetmyer out. Therefore losing this doesn't make us inferior. I wanna see whether this comment ages like milk or wine.,12
If there was only 1 day in this entire season for Rohit to make a daddy hundred then its today,3
We have done well against MI surprisingly. 12 W and 12 L.,4
"this will be good to see,2 mutual fund advisors going against each other.",15
Wow Rahane is in,5
On the other note Tewatia is going to make a bank in the next auction.,52
"Sehwag on Cribuzz was talking about mind games by Ricky where he won't want MI to get used to DC's prime XI,because atleast one playoff might be between them. Lets see.",6
"My fellow DC fan's i agree with your skepticism but this team deserve's a bit more faith. Rahane and Carey are far better replacements then any other team could afford. Both are pretty solid, so let's keep a little faith ya as we have kept over the years",8
"Thank fuck, Rahane finally gets a game",3
"DC has solid team, even when pant and hetmyer are out, backup options are solid.",2
Djoker getting bageled lol,2
Gonna miss Pant shouting while the spinners are on :(,10
"The top 3 really need to show up, we don‚Äôt have anyone to accelerate the innings after them",2
"3 Mumbai players in Delhi Capitals, just one in Mumbai Indians

Edit: 2 in Mumbai Indians, SuryaKumar Yadav too",1
Me jumping from the srhVSrr thread to this thread...pArKOuR,0
"Fuck yeah been looking forward to this all week.

Mumbai vs Mumbai (Delhi branch) Letszoooo",36
Rahane solely in to weaken mumbai.,10
"**Most matches for MI in IPL**

Kieron Pollard - 155

**Rohit Sharma - 150**

Harbhajan Singh - 136

Lasith Malinga - 122",8
Who is keeping for DC?,2
Delhi is more Mumbai than Mumbai. /s,2
"Shaw: is a youngster
Also shaw: looks like the oldest member of the team",2
"Really upset about Pant being injured.
Shame Hetmyer has to miss out because of it too, after a very solid performance the other night.",8
"If Mumbai win this they'll prove to be the better side without doubt considering both teams have only won batting first so far.

If Delhi win, well, I'll be happy, but they're batting first again, so.... Need to see them chase one down still.",1
"So MI has 4 overseas, 5 Indian and 2 wannabe West Indian players.",34
"Tough luck SRH, rest assured we'll gift you 2 points on Tuesday",3
Today is already a 10/10 day thanks to Lord T. Anything from here on is just cherry on pie.,3
Why do they start the match at 7:26 pm ?,-1
No singing from Pant today.,2
Ok bois. We are here.,3
Petition to make Carey carry a speaker and Pant speaking trash from the dugout,8
Delhi looks quite weak tbh without Golu and hetmyer.,2
IPL teams seriously need an away jersey.,8
"That time of IPL is here, where you support the teams which will help your favorite team in points table.

From KKR's perspective, happy that Rajasthan won today. Had SRH won tonight, then they would have displaced KKR for number 3 position.",3
2 untested players. Big oof for Delhi,1
What happened to Pattinson's hair lmao,1
I'll predict : The bois in blue are going to win,17
Pain,1
So they really bench hetmeyer just when had his first good knock,0
Anyone else remember rahane's debut for India. It was a T20I in a series where we weren't really batting well and rahane I think batted brilliantly with plenty of hook and pull shots.,3
Boult‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
I hope this match is EAZZYY even without Rishabh,1
Yup next over Bumrah incoming now,2
"Of all days, why didnt they go with the classic kit?",3
Amazing placement /s,3
YESSSS,3
Boult.... You Beautyüòçüòç,9
Yooooooo let's go,3
GG MI just take the two points.,8
MI's usual tactic of scoring a fuck load in the death won't work with the likes of Rabada and Nortje.,7
Insert Michael Scott GIF- Everybody stay fucking calm,4
:(,1
"**0.3** Boult to Shaw, OUT,  **4-1**

Why do Australians not know what a haircut is?,4
Send jinx,2
Just came in time. It's time for Ajju masterclass ü•∞,2
Blue jerseys should be banned. So boring.,4
Lol Rahane in the middle order. Send him in now and cut yo losses DC,0
"[Yup. Law of averages kicks in, he was doing too well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j94ccr/match_thread_27th_match_mumbai_indians_v_delhi/g8hexqt?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)",2

DK apology Thread get ready you might have to create one today",2
"Guys, there was a post where people complained the IPL match threads have turned toxic and racist. Let us moderate ourselves and report any comment/accounts that make racist comments on the match threads.",6
MI vs MI lite,8
Toucha boy gone with a softy.,1
Don't do *cough drops* kids,3
"Without Pant, Delhi's batting suddenly looks so much more non-threatening. They'll really be screwed if he's out for the season or something. Does not bode well for them that Rahane is the only replacement they can turn to. Yeah Jinx can be a handy opener, but in the middle-order as a Pant replacement? No way.",3
[deleted],8
I feel Carey gonna pull an Ingram from last year vs MI. And this game is gonna go on a similar lines,3
Nothing shot from Shaw. It's all boom or busy for this boi,4
Kinda wanted sandeep to play for DC so that I could get a chance to project myself onto him and feel the vicarious thrill of fulfilling a dream I had when I was 14,3
Scene's if Rahane scores a Century and Pant is left in the dugout for the rest of the season /s,4
Rahane + Dhawan. ODI innings incoming,7
Why is Rahane here?,2
So DC are back to their regular jersey? What was the switch about?,2
Why is this match thread buried deep? Any way to make it sticky or bring it up?,21
This is pretty much the only way Rahane will get to open,3
Benching pant for rahane looking alright now,-1
I still remember Rahane cunting SA bowlers all around the ground in the 2015 WC like it was a T20.,8
I trust Rahane to negate the pace duo of Boult + Bumrah.,2
That catch reminded me of IPL final where Krunal dropped similar catch of Rahane,1
RIP the run rate now,-2
"I want Rahane to score big, Bumrah to get purple, and MI to win.",2
Best thing that coulda happened in terms of Rahane. Can  make up for Shaw's wicker and settle the innings if he gets going.,1
Can't differentiate between the 2 jerseys today but I'm colorblind so it doesn't matter,19
"Imagine having Rohit opening, Hard Dick and Pollard as hitters, and Boult and Bumrah to open and finish an innings. Mumbai have such a polished side",5
So Rahane gets his wish to be the Opener literally.,9
The teams really need to be more imaginative with their jerseys,7
Rahane 99*(59) coming up,3
When was the last time someone got a fifer in IPL?,1
Is it now time to think about Home and Away jersey in IPL as well?,3
I hope rahane scores today as a big fuck you to rr,1
To think that this pair was India‚Äôs opening pair in a WC SF in Wankhede.,0
Delhi bat so deep until Rabada. Does Nortje bat too?,0
What happened to Hetmeyer and Pant? Injuries?,1
DC and MI have the same Jersey,0
Oh Carey is playing. Interesting,0
"So MI has more Delhi players than DC
& DC has more Mumbai players than MI

Welcome to IPL :)",18
"If Rahane performs and Pant recovers, Dhawan‚Äôs place would be in grave danger",6
absolute scenes when rahane disappoints,1
"This is the worst time in Delhi in terms of weather. I'm fine with the 46-47¬∞C heat and the 2¬∞C winters. But this slightly hot, slightly cold weather is shit. Turn on the AC it becomes too cold and turn it off and the room becomes a fucking desert.",1
Lol I just showed up and a wicket fell very nice,0
"Rahane was decent last season for RR, Avg. nearly 33 and SR of 138.",4
Cunted,1
Oh no..........    You sexi rahane,1
"So, DC's lineup today, can we look at it as rotation or experimentation?",3
Wow. Jinx looks in fine touch.,2
Rahane preparing a massive fuck you to r/cricket,5
Rahane looking very positive today!,2
DC deosnt have an Indian keeper?,1
No Bumrah in the power play today?,0
Halsey said everything is blue and today I understand what she meant,1

Rahane might be the best batsman to take on Boult and Pattinson,1
Ok so Pant is out. Was limping in the last game. Does anyone know how he actually got hurt? Didn't look like he fell or had any other issue.,2
Ugliest hairstyle of the year goes to.....,4
Was in your arc jinx.,1
Can we start a donation drive so that pattinson stops cutting his own hair and go to a barber?,3
[deleted],1
Hope Jinx scores a big one here and cements his position. I don't care dropping a slogger in favour of some solidity,8
"Wait, Rahane is not in RR anymore?! I feel so ignorant about IPL",3
"Man, I wish Shaw could be just a tad more responsible, not too responsible in the sense that he doesn't score any runs, just enough that he doesn't give so many soft dismissals away.",5
If people are having trouble telling the teams apart here‚Äôs the biggest difference I‚Äôve noted - The Delhi team are wearing some kind of headwear and holding what looks like a stick,3
DC's middle order without Hetmyer & Pant is looking very brittle,11
Australians really love the ridiculous 80's hairstyles.,2
"Rahane so technically correct

Rofl",2
Shaw is actually very overrated,6
Rahane anchoring will be crucial for DC. Dhawan should attack if Rahane is for anchoring.,2
Rahane has more IPL centuries than Rohit Sharma,5
why aren‚Äôt hetty and pant playing?,0
Kings XI could have got Boult for Ashwin,3
"If I were Rohit, I'd have dropped Pattinson today from the team solely for his haircut",2
"Shaw is overrated lol

One good innings and that's all

No footwork. No technique. Just bs",2
Pattinson with that haircut looks like the villain's psycho sidekick in an 80s camp movie who likes slicing people open with knives,2
Can rahane play an innings here which willl make him un-droppable next match,3
Time for Dhawan and Rahane to settle everybody's debate of who's the better choice.,2

"Hetymer getting the rcb treatment.

"Good opportunity for rahane to anchor the innings, he normally opens so the early wicket won‚Äôt matter much to him.",3
2014 counter attacking test Rahane vibes,6
dhawan 0(0) : Batting aap karlo mai dream 11 pe team bana leta hu,10
Delhi should‚Äôve worn their rainbow gear today to differentiate,4
Rahane has good footwork duh. He was India's third best test batsman in the last decade,10
Why are Pant and Hetmeyer not playing?,0
"If and when Panty is back, and if we have to play Rahane, one of Shaw/Dhawan will have to sit out",1
"Pant was going to get injured eventually. Wicket keeping is a tough job. Look at the fitness of other keepers in the IPL (Bairstow, Buttler, Samson etc.) and compare that to Pant's.",2
Playing Rahane is a Master Stroke by Delhi,1
Thank god DC let go of that shit tier rainbow kit,1
Rahane is looking so assured in contrast to Shaw. Early days yet but Rahane at top may work for us.,7
It is easy Scotty. Dhawan will sit out if Rahane scores a century.,6
"pant is injured, was it before or after his batting in last match ?",0
Rahane >> dhawan. You wankers can disagree and call him the second coming of Uthappa as I've seen said here often ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø,10
Ouch this hurts,2
When is the aus tour?,1
Shaw is a free wicket lol.,-6
"I had never heard about pattinson before, so I didn't know how to feel about him in MI. It has been 6 matches, and I am still clueless. Is this guy good or.... ?",1
"If Rohit doesn't have an acting career after he retires, I'd be disappointed.",7
Hope all the CSK fans who wanted Rahane in a trade cry while watching this innings.... OUR BENCHWARMER <3,1
"Good boy Shaw, wants to show rahane is better than dhawan",5
Patty has big hulk vibes,1
Dhawan did not face a single ball until now :),2
Mumbai jersey sucks. Why don't Ambani put some money to design a nice jersey for the team.,6
Rohit 150? Is that his weight in kilograms?,-8
that gold is sooooo tacky,1
"After that first game, and Danny Ric's podium, I have very high expectations for this one. Pls don't disappoint DC",1
[deleted],6
As the wickets get progressively slower that‚Äôs when you need Rahane in your teams,0
1st and last chance for Rahane this season(unless ofc he gets transferred to some other team). He must make this count.,3
Wow. Pollard hit 150 before Rohit?,6
"Hope it's Brohit day today. With the kind of form he has had from the WC19, it's hard not seeing him score hundreds every match",3
"This is why you need atleast 2 Indian WK in your squad. Now DC is in a position where they have to replace 2 players just to play the WK who is an overseas player, & one of them being someone who performed pretty well in the last match",7
Chak de phatte etc just faced his first ball. Moral victory (:,2
We should always play Rahane on these pitches. You need 160+ to win which he can really help get.,1
All or Nothing : Delhi Capitals.,0
Shaw is poor man's sehwag.,28
Let‚Äôs take a moment to pay respects to SRH,24
One of these teams should change their jersey color.,3

Did someone on this sub shit on Rahane to ensure he makes an appearance and plays a blistering 53(27) knock hence being memed into form?,6
The two jerseys are too similar,6
need new zealand rahane from February back plz.,2
Nothing reads 163/2 after 20 overs than a top four of Shaw/Dhawan/Rahane/Iyer,13
Strike rotate BC!,1
Rahane middling like he has a point of prove,4
Whu don't teams rock black? It is great as a primary colour. I have only seen RCB.,9
I had actually forgotten how much I missed Ajinkya bat:),6
Happy to see Rahane yay,6
Fucking hell. No slip in place against a Boult who has been spot on,3
The two jerseys are too similar. Looks like a practice match,2
Rahane carrying on from the NZ Test series.,3
Been 3 overs and Dhawan boi played 1 ball,6
Watching Dhawan and Rahane brings back fond memories of my Hero Splendor. Took an eternity to get started.,6
"feel bad already that jinx gonna be dropped mid season, like last year!",0
Why don't they have Home and Away Jersey's every top level league has it,3
Why would you give any width to Rahane?,3
Mumbai vs Mumbai,2
"Oh my god all this time I thought MI was in top, I celebrated Shaw's wicket too soon. Go Delhi!",2
You all say Dhawan not good in powerplay. *SO MY MAN is at non-striker for the whole powerplay* üòé,6

160+ should be defendable,0

"Rahane has got one shot to prove himself.

Mumbai better beware",4
Rahane is legitimately one of the nicest dudes in modern cricket. Such a positive guy,5
Ok calm down now jinx,1
Why's Pant not playing?,1
Rahane not letting Dhawan get on strike to take his spot once pant returns,5
Rahane can score a 50 but hes getting dropped next game regardless. No room for tuk tuk post 6th over in this team boi,1
No idea why RCB released Stoinis. He was amazing last year and would have slotted in perfectly at 5,8
Rahane vs Bumrah will be a good battle.,5

"Gabbar channel your inner sehwag, one way or another",4
"Abhishek, Drink water man.",2
Have always felt for Rahane - he's better than his stats suggest and India could've used him in world cup last year and should more consistently be playing in tests.  Guess Koach has no/low faith in him.,17
Rahane after hitting three fours 15(14),14
If I ever dance like that on a big screen which is broadcasted to millions I will be trolled endlessly for life,54

Gabbar playing a 1 run over in PP. Good stuff.,6
Wait where tf is Pant?,3
Ishan Kishan low-key looks like Definite from Gangs of Wasseypur,20
I haven't seen any genuinely good middle order Indian batsman since yuvi and dhoni. Raina was good for a while but apart from that no one has really made it their spot. Perpetual youngsters in middle order.,12
Missed a maiden :(,9
people here wishing for two sets of jerseys as if main ones aren't shit enough,22
Rahane should be more proactive running between wickets,4
Bin this dj I beg,1
Everyone's a Rahane T20 simp until they remember his innings in the 2016 WT20 semis.,6

Looking at the jerseys and dhawan‚Äôs batting it sure does look like a practice match,3

Krunal Pandya taking Rahane's wicket in Powerplay is something I never thought would be possible.,6
Krunal looks like a budget Hardik.,5

Krunal 'Muralidharan' Pandya,4

"**4.2** KH Pandya to Rahane, OUT, lovely arm ball from Krunal. Given lbw, and Rahane refuses to review after Dhawan suggests this might perhaps be a touch high. Short of a length, angling in, Rahane looks to punch this to midwicket and misses completely **24-2**

What‚Äôs the Hetmeyer shot every other ball lol ?,2
Ajinkya Rahane showed more intent than what Shikhar Dhawan had shown in this entire season.,-3
Man pleaseeeeeeeeeeee keep a slip,2
Big innings coming from Dhawan,2
Love how Indian fans are confused that we haven't replaced Yuvraj or Dhoni when they want every player with any potential dropped after one bad game,21
Why is cameraman showing hetmyer after every shot?,2
Ooof what a shot,1
Pant vs kock,3
Need Iyer out for cheap,2
So Delhi is going off-spin both ways? Haven't seen an all-offspin spin attack since MI used to play Bhajji and Krunal in 2017.,3
This dj or crowd noise guy or whoever is so fucking annoying,4
Can anybody stop Mumbai juggernaut? Even Delhi seems faltering.,6
So many senior player's in the side                                                  Shaw- Why you bully me,2
"Rahane couldnt play a match losing 43 (40), thats a victory in itself for DC <3",3
"Message to all neutrals. 

Support Delhi. If MI win then the top 2 spots will be basically locked and if DC win then the first spot will absolutely be locked with the 2,3,4 positions still open",20

I wonder what happens to the commentators if they forget to call it an Unacademy Cracking Six?,3
Did Patto run out of charge mid-trim,8
Patto bowling garbage today man smh,8

BC Pattinson,6
pattison is gonna get PATTED off today i got a gut feel,7
lmao i knew all of yall would shit on rahane the moment he got out,6
Both teams and the umpire all playing in blue - someone didn't think this through...,19
pattinson leaking waaay too many.,6
Shot,1
"r/cricket: Iyer is useless. Only scores against off spin

Iyer: FUCK R/CRICKET",17
Does anyone take Shaw seriously? I don‚Äôt see him performing consistently and people just don‚Äôt seem to care enough.,3
Pollard be like lets jog with the ball,9
I was told Iyer struggles against Pace?,3

"Your genes have to be really bad if you're gaining weight after playing international level cricket and having the facility of the best cooks, physician and dietician.",4
Iyer just survive for their spinners.,2
"Arent Dc lacking firepower in middle order tonight? 

No pant No hetmyer

Carey isnt a well known finisher even tho he bats at 5 6 for Aus.  He is more of an accumulator.",8
Pattinson should go and come back bald after Ceat Tyre.,2
Why isn't hetmyer in the team,3
My main team let me down today. Hope my side team Delhi lifts up my spirits here.,0
"If Pollard comes running at me like that, I would pass out of fear before he catches me.",7
Pattinson getting punished for that haircut.,4
Wtf is that haircut patty,3
Pollard will finish Pattinson's quota. Dude will probably not get another over.,7
I‚Äôm scared of these two,6
Pattinson getting a 50 today imo.,2
People shitting on Iyer                                                                        Iyer- Mein aapko seriously nahi leta hoon,4
Without Pant this batting order doesn't look all that strong. Especially when Shaw can't stop throwing his wicket away every single match. His development has been so frustrating. He is lucky people aren't noticing that because Stoinis has been in unreal form.,13
Why isn't NCN playing over Pattinson?,3
MI vs DC is shaping up to be the rivalry to subscribe to for the next 3 to 5 years.,5
Imagine ASKING your barber for a window‚Äôs peak. On purpose,4
MI players watching too much of peaky blinders,0
I know I‚Äôm late to the party but Pattinsons haircut makes him look like the half wit page boy in medieval plays,0
"It's silly Rahane took 15 balls to ""settle down"" and got out for an LBW , not even for trying to score an boundary.",1

Only 30 lakh on HotStar? Damn I was expecting much more today,2
People tearing into Rahane innings but can't say anything against Gabbar Dhawan,4
Why did the batsmen put helmets on when Pollard came to bowl,6
When will Hardik bowl????,4
They have to give an altroz to swanny,5
Does Hardik not bowl much for MI?,2
Pollard bowling it always scares me especially since he's become Rajat Bhatia.,6
"H Pandya to elder brother: Aree bhenchod idhar fenkh na ball ko, bhonsdi ke (Hey Benstokes throw ball to other end asshole)

"Dont Dc have other wk options than Carey??

Pollard the most hittable bowler who is never hit.,23
What's with the chutiya haircuts all around?,12
"Looks like Dhawan is going to make all the Rahane fanbois go back into hiding today, ominous touch and form for him today",1
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I hope at least DC would lift my spirits,5
"That was 108kmph lol

Pollard might soon bowl at a spinners pace",1
poor fielding today.,3
"It's so good to see a younger lad Shreyas Iyer captaining Delhi Capitals side, which has senior players like Shikhar Dhawan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ajinkya Rahane etc., who were captaining other teams in the previous years. Fascinating.",8

pollard bowling in slo-mo.,8

Pollard‚Äôs right arm lazy medium is probably faster than Kohli‚Äôs right arm QUICK medium,14
If looks could kill...,11
With hardik fully fit Mumbai will have 7 bowlers and even the part timers are really good,6
Yuvi chants? Did I hear that correct?,2
Can anyone please tell me which Bat is shikhar dhawan using???,0
DC doesn't have an Indian keeper?,4
Pollard reminds me of Denzel Washington from training day with this beard,5
Wait do they still have an announcer at the stadium even though there aren't any crowds?,1
"The slow ball used to be the deception, for pollard it's the run up that's the deception.",5

So what's our official stance on Rahane? Are we getting him in the T20i squad thanks to those cover drives or we still thinking rationally and keeping him away from white ball team?,-3
If you guys have a choice would you rather be an owner or a coach of a T20 franchise?,2
Pollard should be happy that DC took only 10 runs off his slow rubbish.,-20

"Wear your helmet,Iyer boi.

Whole sub is drooling over you",9
Big boundaries.,1
YESSSS üëèüëèüëè Good bowling Krunal,6
An outfielder actually taking a regulation catch? Weird,8
shit fuck,2
Ashish Nehra speaks exactly like the Indian stereotype English,12
"Yaas, Pandya tuich re!",3
DC better register a score b/w 180-190 if they wanna beat a dangerous side such as MI,2
Krunal Pandya has a thing for Delhi doesn't he,9
"Spinner getting Iyer, bruh",5
Has to be stoinis right?,1
LOL,2
FFS Boult would have gone over the line if he was closer. Control the momentum,-1
Krunal just gets the job done somehow,7
Gonna miss u tho shreyas ):,1
Props to Shreyas trying to accelerate now instead of waiting for his 50.,7
Iyer once again fails to finish an innings after getting a start. He's been doing this since the start of last season. A very Rahul'esque knock which has the potential to do harm to the side.,3
Dhawan realised his responsibility of opening well when he saw Rahane walking into the middle,8
"**14.4** KH Pandya to Iyer, OUT,  **109-3**

KL Iyer,1
[removed],-7
Haha Timeout to break the momentum üòÇüòÇüëçüèΩ,3
Send stoinis in,2
Krunal is the VERY DEFINITION of shit gets wickets,6
I have a doubt. If the batsman tries a reverse sweep and is hit on the pads will they still be safe if the ball pitched outside leg?,4
Pressure  in Delhi's batting very much visible...,6
"Problem solved, no more drooling over Shreyas Iyer.",4
Hulk time,1
Is rohit an example of fat and fit?,16
stoinman please have mercy on us.,5
Did I see Iyer getting out on a short ball bowled by a spinner?,5
Why the hell is Nehra obsessed with theory of length ball in death overs ...didn't work shit work for RCB when he was bowling coach,5
Khadoos and Fuccboi otherwise known as Pandya Brothers,5
More like CEAT Tyres Strategic Time Waste,9
I love the McDowell's ad. Especially when all three friends hugüòä‚ù§Ô∏è,6
Shit gets wickets,4
[deleted],-11
Lol they are comparing Nehra to Binga.,8
Imagine playing Gully Cricket with Dhoni and he leaves 4 balls outside off in the second last over,7
krunal didn't deserve one but somehow got two,6
STOIN THE GROIN DESTROYER YEAH CUNT THEM MARCUS,-1
Every wicket involves either Boult or krunal,3
SPEAK NAH ON KP,2
What a shit ball to get out on.,1
Krunal Pandya looks like a young Gulshan Grover,11
"Somebody should pin the message that Pant got injured in Cricbuzz Scorecard somewhere.

Fans everywhere asking angry questions, where's Pant?, why this shit Rahane playing ahead of him? etc.,",6
Stoinis (sasta ponting) coming soon,6
Pandya brothers (+ Pollard) add such value and depth to MI team (in both late order batting and bowling) which is why they are so successful and consistent season after season.,22
I just want someone to hit 4 sixes in a Krunal Pandya over,1
s t o i n i s coming in strong with the i n t e n t,3
"Iyer is usually the anchor. But since Dhawan is already playing it, he tried to hit.",4
165 is par score here imo.,0
"This sub would have called Bradman a bad player after his final innings duck, so reactionary...",21
What choice did Iyer have? Dhawan going slow af. Someone had to go for it,3
Is it just me or does Rohit look less chonky 7 matches into the tournament,11
Big Dick Marcus is here,2
Sexyass Iyer Noooo :(,3
Boys what's the par score here?,3
Dhawan is to Delhi is what Shubman is to KKR. After the 12th over you want them to either go ballistic or get out.,18
STOIN THE GROIN DESTROYER YEAH CUNT THEM MARCUS,3
Feel like pure shit just want him(pant) back,3
Is it an unpopular opinion if I don't want Krunal anywhere near the T20 team? Or am I being prejudiced?,5
Why is the BCCI President allowed to be in ads of gambling apps. Seems inappropriate,18
unlucky shreyas. did the right thing. never really rated shreyas in the t20 format but he keeps on proving me wrong.,6
Australian buddies together at the crease ü•∞,16
"Krunal's job title on LinkedIn is Post man because he delivers whether it's sun, rain, snow or wind!

Put some respek on his name",10
"Shaping to be a close contest. Pretty pleased with MI's bowling so far, Patto being hit isn't too bad as one bowler is bound to go for runs. Doesn't seem to be a very batting friendly surface though.",8
Nadal cruising to victory against Nole in the French OPen.,1
Have a feeling DC will pull this off. They have some amazing bowling plus it will be tougher to bat later on. Patty giving away those runs would cost us.,7
Dhawan has lost his spark. The guy used to be so aggressive until just 3-4 years ago.,1
[deleted],-5
Finally a good bowling day by Krunal.,4
tuned in just in time for the stoinis show,4
"Dhawam had to go mad earlier, now is the second best time",1
Krunal looks like Gulshan Grover,3
Shikar will smash Bumrah for 30+ runs in an over and then slap his thigh until it starts bleeding.,13
Haha. Swann with subtle boult seldom missing catches in the deep joke xD,5
So mumbai has Shane Bond as bowling coach. What does Zaheer Khan do then?,4
Boult is about to get smacked by Stoin,0
Stoinis has big Forrest Gump vibes,1

Damn those ear rings! How much jatre(Fair in Kannada where you get cheap sunglasses and ornaments) can one get?,-4
anyone getting really irritated by the parents in the white hat jr ad?,12
"Hoping for one of the Nole's masterclass comebacks, that he seems to have specially reserved for Federer.",3
"This sub look at Krunal, like he's a village player, he is a decent player, who does his role really well, his economy in IPL is around 7, his main job is to contain the batsman.",27
"El Boulto is so cute üòç

DC were wasting him on the bench",23
Cmon that should have been stopped,7
Shreyas Iyer might be our future captain don't know how to feel about this,3
I have a bad feeling about this match. Rohit and co will take Rabada to the cleaners.,8
50(39) is exactly what Kohli had around this stage yesterday,9
"Tbh, DC batting so far has been borderline tuk tuk",11
"Mumbai got that wicket by playing to iyers ego... If virat out thought and planned for those kind of wickets, we'd have a couple of world cups and a champions Trophy by now...",5

Was Ponting MI's coach when they won IPL in 2015 and 2017?,7
"Dhawan was never struggling this season, just didn't convert those good starts, good on him on the 50* and hope he starts churning out runs like last season",14

Can Carey go big in an over‚Äôs notice?,-3
Great shots,6
That almost hug between Boult and Dhawan,10
We're massively fucked.,4
Stoinis is in some form.,7

Stoinis needs to go else we're fucked,2
Bumrah vs Stoinis gonna be good.,1
Chahar looks more like a rapper than a bowler lol.,7
Aussies what is this?,2
Wtf score is this from No. 1 team?,2
Boult‚Äôs figures mirror the score,4
Doesn't this happen every game of every year? Why don't teams just bowl out Boult by over 7?,9
Anything below 175 would be too easy for MI,1
Till last year Stoinis wasn't able to middle a ball and now playing like this. Did Ponting lent him his bat with springs for this season?,18

No why no  not chahar,2
dhawan needs to swing at it,3
lol no way Pollard is bowling..,2
Dhawan has to take Chahar down now that 50* is done,4
Dj doesn't deserve any rights,3
dhawan forgot he's dhawan?,8
Expecting a murder,4
Wtf was that,2
WHAT THE FUCK,3
What a clusterfuck,3
Would it be an exaggeration to say Stoinis has been the best player of the tournament?,6
Thank you Dhawan,8
F,5
YESSSS ghar ja chal,5
Hahahahaha... Thanks statpadder!,17
VILLAGE,9
That's probably saved us 20 runs minimum,5
Yikes. Stoinis is not happy about that.,9
"Ah yes, DC and that mandatory runout",10
YESSSS,3
Hahahahaha,1
Hahahaha lmao.,3
So casual,1
DHAWAN MY MANN!,3
"Dhawan,what have u done?",1
Rohit really goated as a captain. Chahar getting an economical over here ffs,8
Lol Dhawan wtf you doing,2
Hahahaha,2
fAkE fIeLdInG,9
Never run on a misfield ... old saying and shit,10
Wtf is stoinis doing lol,5
Wtf Dhawan altho Stoinis sort of doubled down and kept running,4
-20 runs from the total there,10
Ponting is gonna eat Dhawan alive today,8

Thats not even dhawans fault wtf?,8
Wonder what Stoinis said to Dhawan as he walked off,3

Stonis brainfart moment lol,4
Lol what shitshow,1

dhawan you better make up the runs,2
there‚Äôs no run there lmao,3

"Lovely. Cheers Dhawan. 

Danger man gone.",4
Idk but are we seeing a lot more run outs lately?,5
Tbf Dhawan did show interest in that run,3
"Dhawan: na run banaunga na banane dunga.

Duuuuude!!!!,3
Run out every game lol.,3
"Which players from non-cricket playing countries have played internationally? Stoinis with Greek origins, there was a Portuguese dude also for Australia. Anyone else?",5
That's just stupid from Dhawan. Don't run on a misfield,3
Silly.,3
Dhawan got lucky.,3
Dhawan playing Pandey innings today.,5
Dhawan is the imposter,7
"Dhawan is trying to get out, but he can't",5
Ffs. Stay up to watch Smithy and the Hulk and they both get run out. Would be sleeping so angry tonight if it wasnt for Marn's shield hundo. Bed time for me,2
Stoinis turning into Wasim Akram of running.,3
Lagaan type fielding there.,5
that's not the kind of misfield you run 2 on my GUY,3
"not on dhawan imo, didn't have the potential for a double",5
Anywhere b/w 170-180 is possible,3
that was lucky..,1
LOL what a catastrophic mistake,3
"Whenever we had stupid runouts in this tournament, we've won the match.",3
What the fuck is up with DCs running between wickets?,7
If I were Dhawan I would not want to go back to the dressing room at the moment.,6
[deleted],11
Why are people acting like that was Dhawan's fault?,7
Dhawan did say no to be fair,7
Second time Mumbai has had 3 fielders try to go for a catch lol,4
The hell...3 fielders and none came close,8
There was no second run in it. Never run on a misfield.,9
Stoinis was just showing us how Pant got out the other night.,9
We dont get over 160 we are in deep trouble,3
KL Dhawan,6
Would have been peak memes if Dhawan got out after running his partner out,7
What is with Australian‚Äôs and absolutely dreadful haircuts?,6
"Dhawan after the match: "" strike rate is overrated""",14
Chahar is misfielding so much he got to bowl,7
"Surprised ma boi Carribean Chahar caught the ball, but glad he did",6
"Rahul Chahar and Yuzi Chahal are sooo good, Imagine them together for India.",1
That's an impressive over from Chahar. Good job boi!,1
Dhawan might as well reveal the mumbai jersey underneath,8
motherfucker go aerial,5
So we're gonna need another monumental effort from the bowling unit today,10
"Carey isn't a pinch hitter, but he's pretty smart and can improvise",7
"Now I ask , is Gabbar better than Jinx ?",3
Why do i feel like pitch is slowing down rapidly?,8
lmao the two Australians Dhawan and Stoinis had a mix up of time zones of Adelaide and Perth,11
Dhawan needs to call a loud NO there because he's looking right at the fielder.,5
Awesome decision to give Chahar that over. Altho run out was lucky but still.,2
Way better than we expected,3
2 overs from bumrah,2
"Great over by Chahar, didn't expect it tbh",3
160 seems defendable,2
"I don't think Carey can come in and start firing, he needs some time to settle in",2
Why do people always like to blame the other batsman for run-outs? This was Shawn's call as he was running to the danger end. He didn't run. Stoinis ran without looking at Dhawan. It was on him.,1
Gabbar ensuring his replacement one failed shot at a time,2
I can't believe taking the risk of bowling a spinner paid off,3
Does Dhawan have that extra gear like Kohli yesterday and convert this 50 to an even bigger one? Let‚Äôs see,2
"I don't know why Star is hyping KKR v MI match. 

We all know how that is gonna go.",8
"Ian Bishop: Hello Lisa, how are you down there?

Lisa: I'm really comfy here

Why isn't Nortje playing is he injured or something?,2
It's not a DC game without runouts.,4

"There is no run, even Dhawan called for it. It's no brainer.",5
Delhi are 100% fucking up a big chase in the playoffs through a run out.,4

Dhawan chutiye tuk tuk,3
Stop playing cutesy Gabbar and hit the ball out of the ground..,8
"With Axar and Harshal still to come, we have to get going now it's the 18th over

Need 165+",5
what happened to pant?,3
so many awkward shots by dhawan,7
Does DC not have any Indian keeper in the squad? Could have used Hetmyer right about now.,2
Half century and a wicket for dhawan in the same inning. What a chad,8
He's not even trying now. C'mon you faced 42 balls. Take lead and strike the ball.,3
I think we'll be chasing around 175 180. Don't think we can do it but hey..,1
Dhawan really can't accelerate and keeps playing at similar tempo,5
Dhawan you‚Äôre not Sarfaraz,2
"Lol Shikhar Dhawan was like ""arre! wahaan toh fielder hai""",10
no Dhawan!! I know DC and MI have similar jerseys but I think you picked up the wrong one instead!?,6
Dhawan is a great ODI player but a shit T20 one. Most of his innings are like this and they do more harm than good more often than not.,10
Dhawan is trying too much and it ain‚Äôt happening for him. Good thing for MI is he‚Äôs still in the middle instead of stoinis,6
Nehra lodu chup ho ja,10
"We won't win any T20 WC in near future the way our batsmen are batting.

40 balls 50 isn't going to win matches on most occasion.",16

Dhawan might start hitting big after the 35th over.,30
Carey was really good in the WC.,9
I swear only Bumrah can make a full toss look like a good ball,9

Sorry I am late were is pant and het?,0
Good luck getting 170 when Bumrah is bowling two overs like this,8

Uwu jasprit,6
"You could see dhawan saying wait but stoinis didnt hear that, miscommunication by them sadly",9
"Chahar & Krunal - 8 overs, 53 runs, and 2 wickets. 

That's absolutely gold right there.",13
Dhawan's stay is now starting to hurt DC,6
"Guys what the fuck is the running nowadays, is it like 10 run outs in 5 matches?? Is the UAE heat affecting them for real?",3
Carrey had a good run during WC19. He isn't a bad replacement for Hetmayer.,2
What to make of Shikhar's innings today. Into 18th over and 55\*(43). I don't remember last time when I saw him batting this deep.,8
Superstriker Heytmer dropped for this match *facepalm*,10
Carey gonna run himself to a quickfire cameo.,10
"Dhawan's problem is that he plays the exact same way in all three formats, which makes him a quick scorer in tests, amazing in ODIs but mediocre in T20s",65
Dhawan wtf are u doing,3
"Pant not playing good for our ears. 
Is he injured?",-2
Gabbar is such a meme player honestly,7
lol Dhawan,3
Couple 20 run overs needed now to handle pollard hardik show,1
Dhawan going to lose this match for DD,4
"""Sateek gend"" defines Bumrah (T: Precise ball)",11
Bumrah has got wide yorker now. Nice,8
boult pls dont fuck it up,3
Bumrah and Dhawan are the best behaved guys in the Indian squad,22
[deleted],8
Shikka Not Da-one,8
I'm disliking dhawan delivery after delivery,5
Imagine Rohit missing out a game and u get Dhawan and Rahul as openers,12
Stoinis runout was his own fault. There was no two there.,11
Missing Pant and Hetmeyer here,5
Shit just went from 100 to 0 real quick....,8
Can carey carry Delhi to 170?,2
Dhawan has always been 120 SR T20 batman and it‚Äôs annoying how many chances he gets for national side.,3
"Bumrah earning his money here, doesn't give anything loose and easy, gift for india.",13
I'll be happy with a 160 chase. 170 will be too much with Delhi's bowling attack,5
dhawan just can‚Äôt see the ball,0
Hate to say this but this inning's from dhawan clearly looked like he is playing to save his spot and not for posting a competitive score.,8
Srh scored 36 in last 2. Is possible but someone needs to go berserk.,5
Proper rubbish innings by Dhawan so far but will get us to 160 which is sufficient.,-1
"Shikhar ""KL '~~Strike Rate~~' Rahul"" Dhawan",8
"If there is one team which can defend 160ish though, it is DC",5
Dhawan‚Äôs roommate couldn‚Äôt get any girl because all the singles were taken by Dhawan,45

I know it was one of you fuckers.",16
Dhawan should‚Äôve sacrificed wicket even if Stoinis was in the wrong,7
"Some idiot was comparing Natarajan to Bumrah. Big, big no. Natarajan just has an accurate Yorker at 135 km/h and that got exposed today. Bumrah has immense variation on line, length and pace that most bowlers can only dream of.",12
"Not one convincing stroke by dhawan today, gabbar my man what is you doing",4
Perennial 120 SR Player,7
F in chat incoming for us,3
Eesh boult at death is always a worry. Big moment if carey can capitalize.,3
How has he played 40+ balls and still can't time for shit,17
"Batsmen striking at 18 against Bumrah when he hits back of a length, at the death, is astonishing! Did not expect that",8
Excellent representation of Dhoni's entire career by Dhawan in just one inning,25
120 renaissance man,5
What is it with these top Batsman settling for a 125 S/R innings? Shameful.,9
Dhawan masterfully stealing singles with 12 balls to go & 6 wickets in hand...,11
Another game where we have to rely on  our God-tier bowling after making a subpar score,8
Shikhar Dhawan's Death over strike rate is 116 what a joke,12
Dhawan might win Mumbai this game,2
First time I agree with the fan poll Bumrah‚úåüèΩüëçüèΩ,1
"If dc loses, they can say their team didn't have full strength. If they win, they've beaten MI despite being the weaker side. Some accidental 6d chess by DC",17
Why are we playing like Chennai,16
"With each passing delivery, Dhawans innings is looking worse and worse",16
Lads imagine Dhawan and the KL of IPL 2020 opening the batting for India,7
Show that poll result to Rabada to rile him up please!,8
Not even running hard. No intent bc.,1
"""We know strike rate is just a number""",7
*Shit got real when he was nicknamed Shikhar Da-One*,5
Dye Jason Roy's hair black and we can convince ourselves he is a Bengali. None of our openers are good enough,4
This is poor from DC,3
Not sure if corn rolls on Indians would fly here in the States,0
they've already got par score imo.,2
Give Dhawan to CSK he belongs there.,9
"Shikhar ""Parthiv"" Dhawan",5
Why is pant not playing again?,1
Does Delhi have big hitters if Dhawan throws away his wicket now?,6
Shikhar tuk-tuk-one,7

This is some god tier death bowling,12
"Oh come on, Dhawan plays like this everytime. Rahane deserves a go, he knows how to pace the innings once he is settled in. Ajinkya has 2 IPL Hundreds!!!",6
"I think the bowling‚Äôs been just that good , the batters have tried",5
"Dhawan should have gone for the run, atleast Stoinis would be here.",3
actually painful to watch,7
Why did they drop Hettie for Carey?,-1
"180 was what was required. 
160 below par 
dhawan with a masterclass here",2
If these guys run another quick 2 Carey will lap Dhawan,5
"Never thought I'd say this, GET AXAR PATEL IN

Commit harakiri one of u bhenchods",12
Nice game tomorrow,7
Finally I thought he forgot how to hit a boundary,13
"DC wasting wickets on run outs is so dumb, Stoinis could've powered the team to a total of 170 here. I think they had like 2-3 run outs last game too.",16
DC top order needs to take a hard look at themselves today. So much talent but throwing away wickets at wrong time. You can't always rely on Stoinis to finish. MI wins this nice and easy.,12
Bumrah pls 10 max,3
Bro Dhawan WTF ü§¨üò°,14
nice to see a boundary every couple overs of this odi,9
This is not looking like enough for a team like Mumbai,11
Bc mushkil se 4 maara fir dot khel gya.,4
Missing Pant-Hetti here,3
Shikhar DhaONE,6
I call 154,0
Surprised Boulty didn't get whacked around,2
beautiful delivery,4
The downvoter is back!!,1
Bow chikka shikha DaOne,3
"I could‚Äôve been fooled if someone told me this was the 9th over, not 19th.",7
Delhi probably won't even reach 160 at this point.,6
ITT: both sets of fans thinking they've lost already despite this being the first innings,10
Incoming MI collapse 8 req of 6 balls krunal on strike,6
Well Boult!,8
Odi type shit goin on here,2
Dhawan is the imposter.,3
Dhawan to CSK next season confirmed.,6
[deleted],5
Wait... we‚Äôre in the 19th over already??? Wtf?,6
Why are rishab and hetmyer not playing?,1
Dhawan is fighting for a spot with rahul. so he's going to bat like Rahul.,10
Are these Death overs going?,1
I remember when he played for mumbai people called him shee - kar.  Shee is shit in marathi,5
Ffs even Rahane was showing more intent than Dhawan is,2
Lol they tapping it around like a test match,3
I get that it‚Äôs a great Yorker but I still wouldn‚Äôt be blocking it,4
Strategy for Delhi when they meet MI next time: Make sure Pant is fit and ready to hit.,8
Honestly even if Dhawan gets set he rarely cashes in during the final overs. That's the major difference between him and Rohit/Kohli,10
"Scotty trying to do an Donald trump here.

Refusing to accept the results.",7
"""Best cuisine in the world"", I nod in agreement as I devour my vegetable pulav with raitha.",6
"Nobody can even hit a full toss from Bumrah, who genetically engineered him?",8
I thought as long as Stoinis was there 180 was reachable.,1
Selfish innings from Dhawan.,2
Thala Dhawan,8
"For the 100th time, Pant is injured!!!",30
Stoinis getting out has definitely made DC 15-20 runs short,3
Damn he can hit boundaries too??,2
"Honestly, that was Dhawan's call for that run, and he ran Stoinis out. He costed DD 15-20 runs.",6
Get Rahane in for Dhawan next match,1
dhawan just showed why he's the best ODI player.,25
*Intent* making a special appearence,6
hardik's birthday jinx gonna hit us today.,6
Well paced innings by Shikhar ODI Dhawan,8
[deleted],1
180 was guaranteed if Stoinis would have been batting,7
Iyer giving Carey and Dhawan the middle finger for fucking shit up,2
This is the same dude that scored 92 in 50 against us and cucked Pant‚Äôs 100.,6
More of that please Gabbar bhai,3
DC missing Pant and Hetmyer,2
Rohit chuckling at the stupid DJ playing Prithi hype music instead of Dhawans. Lol,6
[deleted],1
[deleted],6
Can Rahane keep?,6
Dhawan statpadding with that 4,8
Dhawan is a cunt and has always been,1
"Talk about efficient bowling, Bumrah is so good",5
Bumrah still not landing yorkers,3
Delhi do not have a single Indian backup wicket-keeper. That's horrible. They're gonna be so fucked if Pant is out for the season.,9
Mumbai should chase this down in 16,5
This is a great ODI innings,2
How do you not hit full tosses???,2
"We've lost so, fuck the match, but that DC girl waving the flag is cute asf",6
FULL TOSS PE TO MAR BC,5
Bumrah bowled two full tosses and you got 2 runs of those,3
I've lived in Bangalore long enough to always read it as Roar Maacha instead of Roar Machaa,5
"52 balls in, still can't hit a full toss ffs",6
KLrahulitis is contagious it seem,3
Two full tosses that Gabbar missed. Really need power hitters here,6
Dhawan hitting a four every few balls so that people forget about the wasted balls,6
"When you hear commentators say much needed boundary in the last 2 overs of an innings, it is not a good thing",9
Can't hetmeyer keep?,3
[deleted],7
Delhi gonna lose because Grandhi is here,1
Bumrah is bowling full toss & they still can't clear boundaries,5
Too much Dhawan slander. Maybe it‚Äôs goddam hard to bat against Bumrah and Bolt for 20 overs at a SR of 140 in sticky conditions with big boundaries? He‚Äôs played well.,10
Are full tosses getting more difficult to hit nowadays,7
"What's up with everyone flaming Dhawan here, the bowling is just good. He has played a good innings.",11
"Why does a batsman like Dhawan who is so aggressive in Tests & ODIs, bat so conservatively in T20s!!?!! This is beyond science.",10
yeah nah,1
DC missed Hitmeyer badly today,6
Cheeky shiky ending on 69,9
Carey is not the kind of batter who'll go berserk in the end of the innings. Would have been better sending Axar in,9
Yay we got 160!!,0
Good score by DC on slow track. Above par,5
"I think they should broadcast why Pant, Hetmyer were dropped. 
Many people are still asking it again and again.",6
Delhi have the bowling to defend 160 odd,6
"Dhawan 69\*   
Me: Noiice.",3
Fell short by probably 20 runs.,1
This is a 160-170 pitch so we have par score. Won't be easy for MI.,8
"Guys discounting the target, need to realize, delhi has a great bowling attack as well.",9
162 not bad...I think MI has an upper hand,5
[Holy fuck I was so so close ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j94ccr/match_thread_27th_match_mumbai_indians_v_delhi/g8hm6nu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3),6
Bumrah has bowled at least 3 full tossers this over  he's really gotten away with it,9
"can't hit full tosses, wtf",3
"Now I know why we're underperforming, the other panauti owner Kiran Gandhi is here watching, needed the Jindals here",6
Three full tosses in last over & still no six,12
"Well, as our beloved King Kohli says- We are 20 runs short...",7
Is Boult/Bumrah the best bowling duo in IPL?,6
Ponting‚Äôs death stare to the camera,5
Kinda worried that Bumrah is missing that yorker length so much,2
Man 170+ should have been achievable,5
"160 achieved moral victory achieved, inshallah bois played well",2
How tf did Shikar survive the night,2
Below par score. MI should win this,1
Did JP just say Yasspreet Bumrah,5
"Corey and stonis  in middle order , I have seen that combination before",3

"It looks to me as if the pitch is slowing down quite a bit. 
Might be difficult for mumbai",1
69 niceüòÇ‚úåüèΩ‚úåüèΩ,3
Bumrah is bowling awful full tosses and they could barely hit wtf,7
Stoinis run out saved 20 runs,8
"69

nice",4
This match really shows the importance of having Pant in the team.,10
"163 to win, still feel like Delhi has the edge but we have a chance bois",5
162 is still defendable if the openers get out early,4
Can't even hit full toss smh.,4
Is Carey supposed to be Delhi's big hitting west indian?,6
Chhii yr dhawan odi khel jaake,6
"Mumbai favorites to win this, surely. 
Rabada and the spin twins gotta do something special to win it from here.",2
Last over - 3 full tosses - 2 singles and a double,3
Vintage Delhi,2
Last 4 overs went for 35,3
"Not sure if this is enough. If the pitch do not slow down further, then it will be hard to explain dhawan knock here",3
Thanks to the gun bowling attack I still have faith,4
"Ahh the in-between score, still feel 10 odd short. But it's gonna be a good game.",6
That was the lowest risk 20 over innings while getting a good score,8
running out stoinis cost us 20 runs,6
Bumrah bowling full tosses and these International players can't even hit them. Pathetic,10
"Iirc DC had another jersey 2 matches ago. With more colors and stuff. Why did they wear that? Was it a special day or dedication?

also, the current DC shirt is a beauty.",6
DC has never conceded 162 (except in sharjah). i think advantage dc.,11
Shikhar should‚Äôve gotten out 15 minutes ago. Rahane should‚Äôve never played. Wtf is this management? Even Ashwin would‚Äôve been better than Rahane at that position.,-5
"Bumrah bowled 6 full tosses that innings, including 4 in the last over, for a total of 7 runs. Is this an intentional thing he's been working on?",13
Above par score delhi shd defend it easy with bowling attack,0
"Delhi played like a team who think they already have enough.

Such confidence in the bowling!!",1
"Bumrah has 0 wickets from this game? Whaaaat?

RABADA will hold on to the purple cap",15
Uh so Pant's 30 off 15 were an important part of DC's batting,17
[deleted],9
15 short of where they could've been. Some excellent bowling and some missed full tosses.,5
162 is decent. Not the kinda score that DC will feel that's enough to win but also not the score that MI can just waltz to.,8
"Without sounding pessimistic, Nokia will have to operate at 6G and Ash being ruthless in running out the lad's pulling a sneaky one. For us to defend this",8
Dhawan with a nice 69 not out,4
"Dhawan scored at 7.96 per over 

Run-rate is 8.1",7
I think we have been too critical of dhawan here. We don't know the conditions as of now. Let mumbai bat and judge then. He has run a lot kn this innings and the bowling has been top notch too. Let's see how it goes.,6
"Is 162 a par score on this pitch and surface?
(P.S.- Delhi have one of the best bowling attack in this IPL)",1
Not scoring at least 80 after carrying the bat in a T20 innings is criminal.,6
1/51 off the last 5,2
"Feels like we are 15 runs short, but DC has the bowling attack to defend this score",3
"We lost to SRH chasing 163, but we can't chase to save our lives, while MI with their mighty batting lineup should find this chase a piece of cake",2

How do you not hit 3 full tosses out of the ground in the 20th over ?,4
3 Bumrah full tosses in the last over for 6 runs. Nice.,12
If DC don‚Äôt want him we will take Shikhar down in Chennai any day,4
"So, can DC defend this?",1
Mishraji playing today?,1
"Below par score, IMO. Especially with how strong MI's batting is.",2
Who is jinx?,2
DC batsman really make it look like that  bumrah was bowling well,2
Is it just me or Bumrah hasn't been as consistent as before with his yorkers since his back injury.,4
Feel like 10-20 short of a challenging total for MI. Let's see how fierce KG and Nortje is today.,3
The real Nacho Varga would score more than 69 if he batted all the way through a T20,10
If Delhi wins its all well and good. But that sort of innings bounds to get you dropped if you lose. Especially when you bat through and sort of is the reason for your finishers run out.,3
"Dhawan's SR is 132.69. If the entire team plays at that SR for 20 overs they make 159, they ultimately get 162, largely as a result of Dhawan's SR. 

It's not good enough considering they're just 4 down. I don't think T20 is Dhawan's best format, he's a class A ODI player though.",10
"**Delhi Capitals**

80 for 2 in the first 10 overs

82 for 2 in the next 10 overs

*Consistent performance-Thanks to Dhawan*",21
"This just might be my bias bubbling up but this hasn't really looked like a 180 pitch

Will see in a while if it was the pitch, really good bowling or just plain bad batting that resulted in such a slow innings",5
Kohli & Dhawan were treading similar paths at the 16-17 over mark. What's difference is the way Kohli ran & looked to score every ball,11
"This match has shown how important Pant is in the middle order for DC, keeps the RR in check and without his presence team composition has take a hit..",6
"Damn, I don't think we're winning this one. Maybe if it was against KXIP, but MI are top class.",7
"If you open the batting in a T20 and you're still there at the end of the innings, you should really be at least close to scoring 100",4
Did krunal get a new haircut?,1
This is one of the lamest carry-the-bat innings I've seen,4
The only other time Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane have played in the same XI was for MI against RCB in Johannesburg in IPL 2009.,5
Dhawan score nice,0
"DC got what I considered the bare minimum in the last 6 overs... 60 ish runs. With the wickets available, they should've had 70-72 runs. MI may just chase this down",4
Mi is winning it.,2
Who's gonna be the first choice opener for India in T20s alongside Rohit? Dhawan or Rahul? Dhawan kinda looks past his prime. Or will Dhawan open and Rahul play at number 4?,2

What a wonderfully balanced 1st innings,1
DC  were so stubborn not giving any fantasy league points to MI bowlers :(,3
I will comment on Dhawan's innings after the match. I have a feeling that Delhi's score of 162 is pretty decent on this pitch. With their bowling i would back them to defend this.,0
"I love Krunal Pandya in that Zubaan kesari ad. The gesture he does with his fingers like I'm watching you boi, you better be chewing that pan masala.",7

"honestly I think want to judge Dhawan's inning after MI's batting has finished but he couldn't seem to connect as convincingly as Iyyer(or even jinx, even though he shat the bed)",2
The game depends upon the famous Nohit-Brohit line,12
"Krunal definitely looks like *gareebon ka Ajay Devgan*

Hope at least we can reduce the NRR damage.,9
"Dhawan's innings is a good innings if you have Pant and Hetmyer in your lineup, not as much with Rahane and Carey. 10-15 runs short imo, need to get Rohit and QDK to stay quiet early if we want to defend this",5
"I've seen people bashing Rahane for scoring a 100 off 66 balls (they said it's a low SR), which they then use as justification for not playing Rahane, who's directly competing with Dhawan for a slot in the XI, while Dhawan makes a nice little 69 (52). Just wow.",4
"160 is a great score considering they were up against slow pitch and  possibly the best bowling line up of the season (and one of the strongest in the history of IPL). I dont' see the reason for hate, Dhawan did what he could. Maybe stoinis would have done better, but more than likely he would have gotten out earlier. This will  make for an entertaining match",2
"Why are there so less MI fans in this thread?Everywhere  I read,I see only comments in praise of Delhi's bowling,Does no one have confidence on MI's batting!!",5
It's going to be close.,1

Not sure about this total. Dhawan does not seem to have that extra gear like Koach or Rohit in T20 cricket.,6

MI never successfully chased 160+ target against DC/DD,11

No idea why this thread shits on Iyer. The guy came in a crunch situation. Hit 3 quick fours to release pressure. Built a good partnership. Showed intent and got out while trying to hit big. He even has a 88(38) in the tournament so clearly not a tuk tuk guy.,31

"Every cricket fan after hearing nehra's commentary in dugout and in hindi commentary:

RCB mishandled Quinton. Should have persisted with him.,3

Ashwin costing us valuable fair play points smh my head.,11
lol Ashwin's shithousery starts as soon as he gets hit for a boundary,6
"Trying to belt Axar, nice try",2
Ashwin running reminded me of mishraji,1
Ashwin needs to come closer to the wickets while bowling to de Kock.,1
Yeah Quinnie!,1
What was ashwin saying to the umpire,1
That's poor from Ashwin really.,1
Ashwin has to get De Cock out now. Via runout.,3
"What a shot, Kock",2
Nehra after every ball: delhi ~~daredevils~~ capital....,6
yes my boi QDK,1
"Ashwin's got a quick hand

He'll look around the crease, he won't tell you his plan

He's had enough of batsmen's shit

Hanging out his mouth he's an ethical kid

Yeah found a six shooter gun

In his changing room, oh in a box of fun things

I don't even know what

But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

All the other kids that are outside the crease

You'd better run, better run, outrun his gun",5
So Ashwin was gesturing to the umpire because he was making him too much in between balls?,1

Well.. the good news is that now we'll see some 2s and 3s which are becoming crucial to keep ticking over in these grounds.",0

That was such an unnecessary shot. Dekock is already taking the pressure off. Just give him the strike. Literally the whole leg side is open as well. Could have just swept and it was a 4,2
One thing that is missing now is Pant's incessant chatter behind the stumps :),4
Rohit doesn't like even a pinch of spice in the pitch.,3
Hetmyer finally performed and got dropped immediately because Pant got injured lmao,6

Why do Ceat Tyres want to sponsor a destroyer of momentum?,3
"Ho gyi na.. Hadbadi mai gadbadi

T: It happened, mistake in the rush",3

Nice intent you showed today Kock. Your thrusts and shots were good. You kept up the momentum and didn't disappoint. Keep up the fluidity and easeüëçüèΩ,8
I feel MI is going to choke,-2
I just found out about the world of wattpad fanfics. There's teenage girls writing fantasy romance novels on cricketers.,2
Swann has been an excellent addition in the dug out,3
"If I don't see a ~~Mankad~~ Ashwin tonight, I will be very upset",2
Should bring in Rabada next over,2
Ashwin‚Äôs tactical and Ethical‚Ñ¢ drop because he realized that the wicket of de Kock was more important than that of SKY,6
"Ashwin was threatening to take wicket from the first ball.

Finally it comes",3
"Too late already for DC, IMO.",3
timeout gets yet another one,1
Sky and hard dick look exactly the same with their shape and tattoos.,3
I hope the selectors give Ashwin another run in the LOI team. He's bowling beautifully!,1
"De Kock leaves, Oh wait hold on, De Kock comes back... nvm its Ishan Kishan",3
DC needs atleast 2 more wickets for even a chance at this game.,3
Sidhharth Malhotra totally banged that chick,-2
Finally! Now just 8 more wickets and we have a shot at winning... What a batting lineup Mumbai have.,3
Iyer thinking like r/cricket üëå,3
Ash's left shoulder is still drooping a bit . I doubt he is 100% fit for the game.,1
fucking fuccck. rabada is back. welp.,1
86 from last 10. Surely they can't do it now against Pollard and sons.,1
Rabada is always smiling and Jofra is always disappointed it seems .,5
"Surya is really underrated player, even for kkr he always scored at a brisk pace. Never one to soak up balls as we often see.",2
What does Tata Altroz mean?,2
not sure if ishan can (or has played rabada) before?,0
Why so many surrogate ads in IPL for alcohol,1
Fuuckk!! The way things have gone. After a wicket falls usually batting sides shit the bed.,1
What the hell SKY?,1
What tf man,2
This is what we do in gully Cricket,2
Fuck that was bad. Wrong end.,3
Lollllllllllll,2
Oh my god how can you this lucky?,1
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT MAN????,1
"SKY is a better batsman than Ishan, imo",1
How do add the trademark and copyright superscript,4
what a shambles!,3
"How is the not a wide, utter shit umpiring",1
Calm down,1
Fuck shit no,1
ISHAN BHOSDIKE WHY YOU ALWAYS SO DESPERATE,5
Lenskart jacking off to this right now,13
"Mumbai: here, have a free run out

Delhi: no, I don't think I will",7
Ponting literally having a meltdown rn,17
Awww fuck this,4
Kishan ffs,6
Rabada run back to the bowler's end!,5
Yikes,1
Is this auditioning for lenskart ad ?,13
Absolute comedy LMFAO!,2
Bad cricket all around. Wtf was that.,1
"Kya kar rahe ho bc!

Applies to both MI and DC LMAO",12
Yo what...,2
No idea how Delhi fucked that up lmao,5
Ishan Kishan looks like Definite from gangs of wasseypur,9
Rahane makes one good effort and its a missed opportunity,5
Rahane is good,1
Kishan playing relay race,2
"shambolic, I tell you",2
"Stay away from Pointing! Stay away from Ponting, Rahane!",4
Sky will only be considered a success once Times of India publish their 'Bihar's son makes Mumbai Indians proud' article on him,6
Lol why are we hurrying this? Especially against Rabada!,0
Kishan ran 1.5 times the pitch lmao,3
Ohhh don't do this to me MI.  we can easily win this if we just calm down,4
Ponting is going to eat them alive!!,8
"LOL.

Direct hit.. saved him!!",7
ARGHHHHHHHHH,3
"Bad at running, bad at running out. This is proper Daredevils territory",13
New ad material for Lenskart,7
Is that what u call Comedy of errors?,7
Kishan absolutely runs like a headless chicken a lot of times. Ffs calm down bro.,9
Omen is with MI today.,1
Badrinath wears some whacky jackets,1
Ponting was staring daggers lol.,6
Lenskart: Stonkss,2
Kishan would have been out if he had stuck to his plan.,2
How did they fuck that up so bad???,2
give ishan the 1.5 runs you ‚ú®cowards‚ú®,2
WideüòÇüòÇ,1
That nicked come on man.,3
"That had an edge, no?",1
Surya sold him down the river. Luckily the transaction was declined.,3
Shitty umpiring as always,2
"*Checks Ponting's notes* 

Why do I read just *fucking idiots* written down a hundred times?",23
FFS guys what the hell was that. Terrible running .... let's clean that communication up. We don't need to be busting for singles so hard .... plenty of time still left.,1
Ponting thinking rn: MC!,2
"Rabada so wholesome ngl, still clapped for Rahane üòä",13
Still get a feeling those 10 or so runs DC missed out on will be the big difference.,3
[removed],2
SKY plonked his bat in too; would have been epic shithousery if he was the one run out after all that.,5
"Alright pack up, Mumbai are losing here

hehehe......",0
"Lol Ricky ponting looks really pissed, like when he smashed a television after being run out one time",4
"Rabada, please rattle this brat",4
Is that Ryan Harris near the laptop in the DC dugout ?,4
"Dahiya used to be a Hindi commentator a few years ago, wasn't he?",2
That was such a good bouncer!!,2
"That hit him, not a wide. Wtf is up with umpires this year thouhh",3
Two Biharis at the crease for Mumbai atm. Love it!!,0
IK is just a Pant in disguise,6
Ponting clinched his ass so much that we can see it on his face,6
Direct hit at the wrong end. My teachers would have said 'why don't you use your talent for something good?',12
cricinfo shows that throw was iyer's ?,3
*Delhi can runout their own batsmen but not the oppositions*,9
"MI batsman can't hit Rabada. 

They are losing momentum.",8
Thank god he touched it. Otherwise balls going over the wickets are also wides apparently,3
Ishan is not good at facing decent pace.,4
Harsha thought there was a wicket lmao,3
Need another Pollard Masterclass probably,2
"Still two overs of Axar left for Ishan Kishan, just smash him.",1
kishan does not look in good nick.,2
Can we try bowling Stoinis again? Spin ain't working,2
"Ah yes, Katrina kaif‚Äôs father",5
Wicket alert this over üö®üö®,-1
Do DC have any meme bowlers?,2
Kishan needs to bat more sensible,1
Rahane always looks sad and Shikar always looks happy.,9
Pollard's beard is straight up shit though,2
"If Ponting had laser eyes, he'd have obliterated half this team by now!",15
Should Stoinis get an over or two?,1
Will we see a slog at 0 by Kishan today,0
Mahela always always sits in that corner chair,4
Biggest fantasy point heist by dhawan,2
[deleted],1
Ashwin is bowling a lot of easy one today.,2
Ashwin: bowls trash then complains about the fielders lol,9
I see Rabada's childish smile and can't believe that guy was banned for displaying too much aggression,34
"Hi, I'm from Utopia. Why is DC not named Delhi Indians.",9
These pharmeasy ads make no fucking sense,7
"what is Badri talking about? SKY is usually pretty consistent, can understand if he said that his SR is a problem to bat at lower order in Indian T20 side",4
Bring in Saurab Tiwari in place of Kishan,-14
[removed],4
How the hell is Sky not playing T20s for India,10
Is doosra illegal now?,2
Yusuf Pathan‚Äôs voice is surprisingly calming,2
Nortje can come in now Big cock de kock is gone,2
"These 2 should keep it easy. 

Even 50 off the last 4 overs is possible with Pollard, Hardik, Krunal in the hut",3
"Why is SKY still uncapped?

So the Mumbai can right to match him as an uncapped player. Duh!!",12
Can't see Sharman Joshi screaming in that HDFC ad,10
MI cruising here. Will be tough to beat this team.,1
Our country's capital should be the city which wins the final every IPL,9
Abey saale,2
"MI's game to lose now.

We just have to make sure it goes to the 19tg over so that we don't give up much of our NRR",2
Hahahahahahaha,2
"There is no player front of the wicket in the circle , which is crazy. One boundary and 5 easy singles on offer. Terrible stuff",1
This is where MI takes the edge,2
(cuts to punter),1
"Calling it now, DC will bring it close but MI middle order will see them through",6
Why was Pandya stripping off? Oh wait the song was... Tatad tatad...,3
Ponting gonna eat them alive tonight,14
That smirk that little smirk,1
"Village fielding

Shaw will be obliterated by Ponting*",6
What was that? Poor fielding by ShawüòÇüòÇ,4
Delhi capitals player say: DC se hu BC,4
Prithvi you dumb,9
MI took that 'lockdown feels like a year long' meme too seriously that they think this is an odd year,17
"Oh wow if i was shaw, dont even look at ponting",4
Ponting is gonna kill someone today,9
Ricky about to blow a blood vessel in his head lol.,8
Bruh. That's shambolic fielding.,2
Ponting's gonna murder these lads,2
Shaw is such a liability on the field. Just drop him please!!,1
Sachin was a better fielder than Sachin lite at this age,4
Surya you beauty,1
Ponting looks like he wants to kill someone,4
Pointings gonna tear Shaw a new one,2
Village fielding that lol,1
"Sky targeting Shaw

Smart batting",2
Agent Shaw,3
Ponting seething rnüòÇüòÇ,3

Delhi leaking runs,2
Keep all weapons away from ponting tonight.,1
Shaw is such a bad fielder,4
Shaw is getting some private lessons from Ponting today.,6
That was proper village stuff,2
"Prithvi : Call me ""Riverdale"" cuz I'm an overrated Shaw.",10
Pointing will kill everyone and their families..,6
"Surya has walked out, and played like a boss so far. It's like De Kock, and him have been batting on a totally different pitch.",4
Kishans gotta go now!,2
Will someone pull off a Thala tonight?,6
Prithvi shaw se badha lodhu nahi he koi. 100% correct opinion.,-1
Ponting does have that Homelander glare,5
prithvi pls leave and play for mumbai indians next year,2
"Bottled this one DC, without Pant they are nothing.",1
Shaw is such a shit fielder. Poor fielding speaks to a lack of effort in general IMO... its not so much about talent,5
Shaw is a 40 year old in a 20 year body,6
Ponting wants to win against his old team so hard.,3
Uncapped players used to be called Kingfisher Virgin of the match,2
We need 5 quick wickets now. Well at least we saw Tewatia's brilliant innings so not a bad day tbh.,4
SKY is Samson with consistency,6
Ponting is going to meltdown in rage tonight,4
Cameraman is savage. Every DC mistake and they just roll to punters face lmaoo,28
Can we just end the match now. It's so one sided. Just end it right now,3
[deleted],0
Lmao fail fielder.,8
Imagine being a doctor and still acting like that on TV in front of millions,14
DC isn't going to be able to monetize Ponting's speech today eh?,9
Ponting's face after the Shaw misfield. I'm surprised smoke wasn't coming out of his ear.,9
How does Ponting always have zero emotions on his face?,9
Prithvi Shaw shitting the bed on both ends.,9
Wait... did the lady commentator just says that Delhi spinners didn't had that much of an impact this game..... While in reality it is the spinners which have taken both the wicket!.,2
This innings puts in perspective how terribly we batted,7
Nortje needs an over now to try and get Kishan,3
That Doctor in the cred ad needs a Doctor,6
[Ponting going MCBC](https://i.imgur.com/P6QLCkY.jpg),2
FFS that doctor is dancing on an IPL big screen while others are busy working hard during a global pandemic,3
I'd love to see Ponting's change room talk tonight.,3
bc shaalu kon h??,2
"Bowl next 4 Rabada, Nortje. That‚Äôs the only chance!",2
The ease with which they took 12 runs in that over is amazing,4
"Good chance of Rabada going wicketless today, which hasn't happened in the last 13-15 IPL games, IIRC.",6
Sky is playing so confidently from last match. Fantastic strokeplay! Plays spinners better than many in current Indian side.,8
Lol that's gully level fielding from Shaw,7
Haven't seen an Indian player play spin so well in a long time.,9
"Expo 2020 Dubai

""Agle saal""",5
Shaw is super inconsistent opener with a blemish in the field ever on the cards.,3
I am afraid for tomorrow's match,7
DC need a KXIP level meltdown from MI to win from here,5
"Short of MI Punjabing this chase, there's no way we're winning this",7

"Just asking, no judgement. Would you trust your doctor if you saw him dance in a Cred ad?",31
"I think 25 more runs would've been deciding factor for the match. Pant chose the worst moment to get injured. There were so many full toss in the last 3 overs that we would reach 185 easily. Had stoinis stood, we wouldn't be in the much bad condition rn",6
"If I told you in the morning one match today will be a thriller, which one would you have picked to be the thriller? üòâ",10
SKY>>> Manish Pandey.,15
"NGL, I am kinda scared to face RCB tomorrow with the kind of form Kohli is in.",7
weirdest thing of Indian culture is lakhs and crores,-5
those pythons on stoinis üí™üèº,3
It seems like they want to get as many runs as they could before rabada comes back.,2
"Stoinis vs Pattinson.

it's also the battle of worst haircuts tonight.",6
Shoooooot!,4
Taking the game DEEP,3
Oh that's sexy,2
Nice one KishanüëèüèΩ,3
Play Nokia and Rabada asap,3
Kayo can suck my brown nuts for these ads those greedy bastards,2
Dhawan man that runout will cost us the game most prob. Fucking unkills,9
Chalo bye Pant dekh lega tumhe agle round,1
Now even QdK lite is hitting sixes,9
Aargh gabbar why,2
Ponting looks like he‚Äôs gonna bring out the belt tonight.,23
Who is that MI chick? Selectors?,6
Suryakumar Yadav is to MI what Subramaniam Badrinath was to CSK.,5
Somebody made Ponting's pani puri too spicy today,6
"It's OK, we will defeat them in the finals!",6
Ishan Quishan,3

Absolute waste of Rabada and Nortje overs!!,0

lmao that dude just ran in a circle,10
What's with all the dodgy haircuts among the Aussie players? Did they cut each others hair or something?,8
"Sky can play much quicker and pace the innings better than Manish, really hope to see him get a fair chance atleast",2
"Now next 4 Rabada, Nortje.",2
Even KXIP won't lose this tbh,2
Oooofff size: large,2
Weekend matches yielding similar results. Day games close af. Night matches one-sided.,2
Lol nice KishanüòÇüòÇüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ,2
Ponting sitting there thinking what he is going to tell Shaw in the strategic timeout,2
The fact that Ishan Kishan doesn't rhyme is tragic,8
Rank ball but how an earth did he reach that,5
stoinis dropping some F-bombs,3
Tbh Mumbai are winning so much that I'm actually getting really bored. Exited for the mid season transfer and the end of the group stage. Hopefully once Mumbai are garunteed a spot Mumbai can expirment more with the team.,3
"If DC loses, there are 4 teams with 2 losses each?",3
Badrinath in tamil commentary > Badrinath at Dugout,6
I'm hoping for a collapse so some excitement will be injected,6
MI playing as if the match is at Sharjah lmao,9
Badri in dugout üò≠,2
There is so much more room for storylines in franchise cricket than the international game. It makes it a bit more compelling.,4
Is the match in the bag now? The pessimist in me still has doubts.,3
Mumbai have the best effing Indian batsmen in the tournament. Let's fucking go,6
For CSK and KXIP(maybe) this is how you rotate the strike and keep scoreboard ticking so that you dont fuck up in the death.,2
"Please MI, do a KXIP today!",5
"Axar is yet to concede a six, I believe (?)",3
Calculated shot by Kishan,2
We have been winning despite Iyer captaincy. He absolutely wastes Rabada every match.,-2
It was about time Iyer realized using a fixed template for rotating bowlers won't work every time.,5
Shit over from Stoinis... Nearly brought the RRR to 7. MI can just get a run a ball and an odd 2 to get over the line.,4
Was hoping for a good close game to distract me from how shit England are but this game gonna be over real quick,3
That 6 by Ishan was such a brave shot given the way he got out in previous match. This would've looked so silly had he hit a part timer straight to the fielder in the deep when they were motoring along quite nicely.,6
No intent from Delhi,3
Quite the embarrassment if they win without even having to bring on any of the 3 Ps,7
Rabada time,1
"Danny ""the MIs"" Morrison",3
I thought people were following social distancing rules seriously but turns out it was because of me wearing a Delhi Capitals T shirt that no one wanted to come near me,3
SKY running away with this game,2
Stoinis really said benchod there,1
[deleted],1
Iyer plays random bowling generator,1
"Mumbai really do seem unbeatable. So, so comfortable at whatever they do.",7
Ponting probably wearing a 2013 MI kit under that DC kit.,7
It's just their day today. It's okay DC,2
Time for groceries. GG MI. Hard luck DC.  You should have put another 20 runs on board.,2
[deleted],5
"As an RCB player, I‚Äôm shocked we beat this OG Mumbai team",10
I think it's a reasonably warm take that SKY should play for India.,4
"I want to turn off the match but the way matches have gone in the past few days, I am scared that I'll miss out on some Shyamalan-esque twist here.",1
[deleted],0
Dhawan's half century was probably the most useless one this season.,11
Every skier has fallen into no-man's-land today,2
"Danny says a lot of annoying things but his frequent use of ""hustle"" is the worst",2
Going after Rabada either shows immense confidence or immense insanity,9
Classic Delhi daredevils game,3
SKY is the boss!,6
Everything going MIs way today,3
Beautiful SKYüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ,7
So damn elegant from SKY,5
The morale is already down and they are just going through the motions.,3
What a shot that is,5
"When DC has a bad day, they have a run-out, they miss a run-out, the top edges don't carry",3
Would be great to see Rabada go wicketless,2
SKY should be retained. He seems like a class apart from many domestic batsmen IMO. Even though we might end up losing Krunal. There's like a good 9-10 players MI would like to retain sadly they are gonna lose 3-4 at least.,11
Trademark SKY flick,5
Every team's fielding has been shitty this time...... Athleticism missing this season,3
Woah...... What an amazing wrist work.....,2
NO MERCY,3
fuck this gay earth,7
"SKY don't hit the bowl in air man, let IK take the risk",4
There need to be questions raised if Suryakumar Yadav doesn't play for India after this tournament.,5
Sky is dealing in sky,3
SKY treating Rabada as a county bowler,7
SKY you bastard...Take a bow!!!üôåüôåüôå,8
How did we beat this team.....?,14
This has been some statement performance by MI,6
So pleasing on the eye,2
Oh tomorrow its nice Australian guys match. FINCHY VS CUMMDOG,5
Sky on fire,1
Why did Dhawan struggle so much,9
Mumbai making it seem DC were 25runs short.,3
need sky to see this through plz.,0
"Woah, SKY has swagger",2
LOL get fucked rabada jog on,2
Delhi's batting lineup had next to no firepower except Stoinis.,3
What do you guys think of  Dhawan's innings?,1
"Yeah, Dhawan absolutely shat the bed today",1
I hear firecrackers in Bangalore. Could be a military attack? ü§î,3
DC team collectively making sure Axar doesn't concede a 6. Whatta team.,4
Now I am just watching to see the absolute class of Surya.,2
"It's unfortunate that SKY got to bat up the order at age of 30, would have been an amazing ODI player for India for a decade or so. He will probably still play for India but not for that long.",5
SKY nonchalantly launching KG for a 6 is so nice to watch.,6
"RCB vs KKR at Sharjah, looking forward to it and not looking forward to it at the same time üòÇüòÇüòÇ",7
What happened to pant?,0
SKY really deserves a call up to the Indian team,8
"This is just getting embarrassing now, not even gonna be close.",7
Get fucked RABADA!!,2
Rabada Who.,3
I thought this would be the match of the tournament but this is dead already,9
So everyone's gonna shit on dhawans innings in post match thread ?,1
SKY so sexc...,2
This is a preview of the finals,5
Fml,2
Cant believe this is the pitch where Dhawan was struggling even after spending full 20overs,11
Damn SKY is 30. Why hasn‚Äôt he played a national game yet?,5
That is how you anchor a chase,2
Was hoping for a better contest tbh,6
Mumbai won .. *2019 final PTSD*,3
Pandya giving haircut tips to pollard,2
I feel like DC is letting them win so they'll underestimate them in playoffs,2
Wth is this luck for  MI today.,3
Don‚Äôt play any more risky shots off Rabada,5
SKY not receiving an Indian cap is the biggest scam in the last 70 years of our country,12
"‚ÄúWrist work, sex work‚Äù",4
SKY should be considered for India 2021 WT20 squad.,7
"Can you believe it? Suryakumar Yadav was once the vice-captain of KKR, & he was released from the squad. The management must be regretting that decision after every MI match.",8
Man dhawan doesn't deserve those dream 11 points for this innings,12
"SKY reminds me of Dravid play style.

Such excellent shot placement.",7
Honeymoon period had to end sometime,4
"MI meeting: ""Delhi are good at death, what should we do?""

That was unnecessary,3
"Hardik: Nice hairs bro

Pollard: Thanks bro and i like your hairs too bro

Hardik: Bro",10
Oh fuck me. Please don't do a Punjab,7
DC needs to pull a KKR now to win,2
So... Pant comes in for Dhawan and Rahane opens with Shaw?,1
"If mega auction happens, MI should retain the same set of players, and bid like hell for Kishan and Yadav",3
"No Stoin No Pant, DCs score would always be 170ish.",6
"I asked before, and will ask again: WHY are MI batting with such ease, while DC was into such a grind",10
Why SKY!?,4
"COLLAPSE please, need exciting night matches too, yesterday and today too, noon matches have been amazing...",7
Prolly please,5
"With SKY in this kind of form, I think Rayudu should have stayed retired.",10
Dhawan really should‚Äôve sacrificed his wicket for Stoinis‚Äô,9
two more,1
That was unnecessary. We just had to nudge it around now.,2
"For the person that was pissed about dhawan being criticized, well now you know why ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",3
The fact that SKY is uncapped shows bad desicon making of BCCI,7
"How are these Aussies so passionate about this game.... Loved what they showed in ""The Test"" and now  I'm imagining their dressing room scenes looking at ponting.",5
Not even KXIP could fuck this chase up from now.,8
Well played SKY,3
Unnecessary,0
Could've finished this match... anyways well played,5
Rabada streak continues. All we asked for,4
Has done is job but that was unnecessary. Run a ball almost should have finished,6
Birthday Boy Hardik Pandya Kya Karke Aayega?,5
TBH MI really has a knack for getting players that people don‚Äôt really notice that much (not incl the big names ofc) and workshopping then into form,10

Crazy SKY hasnt got a chance at the international level.,3
Both SKY and Kock fall with nearly identical knocks,3
Chutiya batting lol. I guess MI can afford with players to come,2
"What do we say to comments predicting end of Rabada's wicket taking streak?

Not today.",8
This shouldn't be a problem as long as the players coming in play sensibly,4
If this was KXIP I would have been really worried rn,7
Well played SKY üëèüèª,2
Right if DC can grab some momentum back this might get a bit more interesting now,-1
Since I saw what KXIP did. I'm not going to say this is over till it's over.,1
sabko batting melagi,3
"Ngl, Lisa is a very good commentator.",9

"**14.6** Rabada to Yadav, OUT,  **130-3**

SA Yadav c Iyer b Rabada 53 (32b 6x4 1x6) SR: 165.62",5
Well at least Rabada doesn't get away with a wicket-less match,4
ffs why would you give them a chance?! just run fucking singles and finish this off. there was no need to take those risks.,2
Well played SKY. Nicely done. Softdik please just take us home. Nothing fancy or anything.,4
LOL 50 and out... what a surprise,1
[removed],6
"Lol. What door? 
It'll be a huge effort to take this even to the 19th over from here. Just make sure that they don't finish before the 18th. Keep that NRR in check. We have lost this one before the 10th over. 
MI deserve the win here.",8
How does the dugout get the wicket alert right every time? I get nervous when they call one,5

Rabada has his own back but is it too late? Yadav gets too ambitious. Shuffles across to try and take on the long-on, but Rabada's length is not full enough for that. The skier is taken at mid-off. He is gone but he has left them only a run a ball to get. That is better than batting deep and turning it into 13 an over",8
Maybe this is just one of those matches where everything went wrong for DC and hopefully they will go back to their winning ways after this.,0

"Pretty sure MI has incredible support staff too. I don't seem to recall a time when an MI player was out due to injury. Hardik is fit but they're being careful by not letting him bowl but the team is managing well.

Pant was limping around in the second half of the previous game but he was never taken off the field, and now he's out.",31
Taapsee and Kangana should buy a couple of IPL teams. Spice it up a little bit.,0

Pollard the Starboy of MI,5
Just hoping for Rabada to pick up a few wickets and extend his purple cap lead. Match seems to be in MI's grasp anyway.,5

Actually Mumbai have only 1 over. Rabada has 2 overs and Nortje has 1,2
"Good to see, SKY still thinking hard about his dismissal

"Can't be giving away runs like that, we need dot balls",5

Just not giving a fuck even when wickets are falling.... I want this from KXIP,5
"Pandya is not at all reliable while chasing. Pollard is too experienced, he'll make sure he is there till the end.",3

Kishan is a saviour,2
Load like Big Stoinis is running out of the Nitro boost. Back to his roots now.,2
Scoring 70 of 4 overs is a task to do but chasing 30 of 24 is depressing sometimes. Ask k11p fans they'll give you the details,3

"*He's beaming, in his mind he's beaming. He's steaming.*",7
Kishan has really worked on his off side play and grounded shots.,4
I feel like MI has to make more unwilling sacrifices in coming mega auction than the prev mega auction. Everyone in the team is a T20 royalty or has the potential to be one,9
The only way delhi is winning this is if Rabada and Nokia bowl all the remaining overs,5
Ngl the download cred baby song is kinda catchy lol,7

Absolutely loving Swann in the dug out,9
Fuck me. DC has really bottled this game. Those 15 short runs really coming back to bite them.,7
Dhawan's innings was the cause of Delhi's loss. The runout of Stoin changed the momentum too.,6
Excellent Danny Morrison impression by swanny,4
yes come on dot ball king,4
Very matured innings from Kishan 22 off 13 with absolutely no risky shots!,3
yo this car really isn‚Äôt that great,7
"Swann is either a world class actor for pretending to like the Altroz, or he has a thing for cars that look like matchboxes on wheels.",6

Pollard auditioning for the WI Test Team,-3
Pollard please don't do a Dhoni,-1
I hope to one day love my wife as much as Swanny loves the Altroz,5
"DC in 7th on fair play table, a certain Ashwin might have something to do with it",7
Swann really hates ashwin lol,7
"DC had good middle overs only if they finished it more properly , that damn stoinis run out if we had 15-20 more runs it would have created more pressure .Need more than average target for a complete batting line-up like MI",11
"He might be a little cringe, but Swanny is gold in the dugout",10
Tuk tuk polly,2
How are they fucking finding gap always,9
I actually like Swann going all in promoting the car.,5
Iyer is one of worst captain of strike bowlers I have seen in my life!!,6
Tomorrow we will see a 250+ or 49 all out there's no in between,16
Not sure if this is a shit field set or Mumbai batsmen are stupid good at finding the gaps,8
"Swann keeps talking about how Ashwin's mankad is not in spirit of the game by taking indirect jabs, not cool buddy.",11
That pull might've dug a hole where it landed,6

Tuk tuk pollard with Rabada to come,1

Pollard and SKY are the only MI batters I trust,4
Pathetic Umpiring,-2

"Pollard and Kishan at the crease.

Dhawan's strinke rate cost Delhi the match,3
Volkswagen car in IPL>>>>,4
This game was over 48 hours ago when pant started limping. Removing pant for Carey and you also loose hetmeyer who knows the grounds. Pants injury destabilized the team. Would love to see delhi vs mumbai with a full strength team.,3
"Sigh. Just so frustrating. Even in fucking Sharjah when SRH was batting, the ball was like a magnet for fielders. But now MI is almost getting boundaries at will at perfect intervals.",4
Pant getting injured really upset a well settled team. Hope he is back next match,0
No more breaks in dugout now for remaining ocers,5
Reminder that KXIP needed similar runs at this stage,7
Lmao there was an obvious noise,2
A lot of talk about Right and Left hand combination... What about bowling bouncers to Pollard and IK in the same over LMAO? Imagine trying to vary your length by more than a foot to get the same result. Add the Right and Left on top of that.,2
Is Acko related to Gecko or just shameless rip off,1

Losing one game ain't gonna make the team shit..",10
Rabada never goes wicketless really consistent,5
Australia really out performing the West Indies in the weird haircuts department!,4
MI almost always win these 'big games',10
I think RCB are favorites tomorrow. KKR are a good team but they got their fair share of luck in the last two matches.,8
DC really missed Hetmeyer today,4
At least it's not an NRR disaster,3
What if Ishan Kishan hits a 6 off of Rabada,15
Dhawan fifty led to the delhi loss.,5

SHOTTTT,2
Prithvi bro..,6
What y'all smoking thinking MI can lose from here?,10
"Shaw is so useless, I can‚Äôt even!!",2
Bc most tingu fielder in the deep wtf,14
In what world is putting a 5'5 fielder on the boundary in the death overs a good idea?,40
Ponting is fuming,8
Why though,5
Where is your brain Ishan?,7
"Surya's dismissal doesn't look too good on replays, but he had the right mindset.",4
keep Shaw away from boundaries,4
Ponting is definitely making a basanti out of shaw tonight,6
If only Shaw was a foot taller like the average height,7
Prithvi again with a (difficult) drop,6
Prithvi Shaw has been invited to Hardik's party and wanna get done with this ASAP,6
Fielding is the only thing wrong with DC today.... They need to show some athleticism in the coming matches,11
you did that for what though,12

Ah yes let's keep the shortest bloke on the team at the shortest boundary of the ground,9
"When are we gonna drop Prithivi? Shit on field, shit while batting, shit while running.",4
Axar showing how its done,3
"Too late, axar finally becoming useful these days",7
He was not catching this in any universe.,3
Shaw should have drank Horlicks instead of cough syrup in his youth,14
Again 2 wickets of Rabada give him Purple Cap no one's coming close,3
Match ka Mujrim - Dhawan for slow strike rate,5

Kishan this is so not like Jharkhand wicket keeper batsman üòÇüòÇ,11
"honestly, I was terrified for this match",6
"Death, taxes, and Rabada getting two wickets",10
I told y'all that reaching 180-190 was necessary,6

I turn on the stream again and there‚Äôs a wicket...,4

Lmao very soft dismissal that,3
Please drop Shaw and elevate someone else to open.,-3
Smh these unkills with their tuk tuk Strike rates. Obligatory fuck gabbar,2
Shaw really needs to improve in the field.,6
Shaw is a disgrace as a fielder especially since he is young.,4
Rahane's 15 of 15 looks worse by the minute.,8
"DAE think Ishan could be this generation's Yuvi?

Has the capability to hit big shots, decent batsman.",2
Rcb ain't winning against kkr,9

Should have crossed atleast,5
Defend or Leave Rabada,4

"Half of DC‚Äôs energy is sucked by Iyers body language, No matter what the match situation is that dude looks like me when my wakes me up early on a Sunday morning",12

Em... not too many batsmen left MI. Don't pull a KXIP,5
"Except Stonis, all DC batsmen never stepped on the accelerator",8
MI is the opposite of CSK. It sometimes shows too much intent.,28
"If Dhawan had accelerated a little bit more, 170 wouldve been really competitive.",8
Shaw's score was -6 today,20
"MI really shouldn't have lost the wickets of SKY, Hardik, Ishan",11
Shaw needs to score 30 every game to make up for the runs he gives in the field.,6
"Last time Rabada didn't get a wicket in the IPL, Delhi Capitals were Delhi Daredevils. The game Rabada goes wicketless we know Capitals have reverted back to the Daredevils.",7
Kohli or Shastri need to whack Prithvi Shaw on the head. for all the talent he has his fitness is atrocious,8
Hahha.. As soon as that dropped catch 6 happened. I was just waiting for the camera to pan to Ponting's face. Punter has got an amazing way of not showing anything but giving away everything at the same time.,5
He's still standing at the boundary why,6
[deleted],8
"Man, Prithvi alone has conceded 10 runs in the fielding and a catch.",3
It is not a horrible performance but we could have been much better with the bat and fielding,6
"Mumbai really doesn't do anything extraordinary, they just do the basics properly and execute their plans very well!",10
"Rohit and Pandya haven‚Äôt fired but MI still winning this comfortably, that‚Äôs surely a champion team",15
Couple of maidens here should do it for DC,8
"I aint even mad at Kishan 

He has the liberty to play those shots when your tail has only like 2 bowlers and rest all can bat",13
Who is gonna bowl last over if there will be one ..axar or stionis?,2
Shaw will soon get to 100 dropped catches like his Jersey says.,11
He came he Shaw he dropped,31
[deleted],5
MI be like MC BC DC,5
Krunal to pull out a reverse Tevatia?,3
Shaw's awful fielding will be one of the reasons for DC's loss,3
"Everyone saying DC needed 15 extra runs. Well no shit. But the bowling line up has Bumrah, Boult and Pattinson. And they are all in rhythm. Getting 180 would have been difficult for every team",5
When is the mid-season transfer window? Any specific rules or any 2 clubs can transfer as long as they mutually agree?,3
"Oh shaw is a shit fielder, fanboys downvote me",1
Youve got a six off the best bowler in the tournament.  and still want to hit it in the air. Like wtf Ishan?,6
Where is limegreennalgene? Are you awake baby?,0
This is the last over,3
I would have bet my house on Shaw not catching that. He is an absolute liability on the field.,6
I think I hated Pants behind the stumps chatter so much that I ended up loving it,8
lol the sexual tension between shaw and dropping any ball,9
Why is the shortest guy on the team at the boundary?,9
Maiden hattrick over coming,7
A fully firing DC would be hard to beat.,11
Dhawan's IPL career strike rate is 125 lol,2
"YeH Harsha... Ponting is also ""*intrigued*"" by Shaw",3
Dhawan's crawling really costing Delhi here. Few more runs and who knows,3
Fake crowd going wild,5
The batting and fielding failed the bowlers today,2
"What's with the Back to back useless wickets by Mumbai Batsmen?

"That looked plumb

Edit: or not",-1
Bumrah is yet to come so I am not worried,7
Don't DC have specialist fielders like other teams?,4
Obv not out but a review won't hurt at this stage?,3
Down the leg,2
I still feel all the MI batsmen have the right mindset. Taking it deep can easily eff you up and increase pressure. It's best not to do a CSK or KXIP,7
Nokia no don't,3
but shreyas captaincy a bit lacking today,7
Umpires call,1
How serious is Pant‚Äôs injury?,3
out,-4
Fokat ka DRS,3
"Third Umpire gets Swann's approval, now that's a first",6
yo why is there late drama,5
Okay we just wanted some time for Nortje to reload another thunderbolt.,6
That‚Äôs not out. Clearly going down leg.,4
The hell,4
Just let me go to sleep you guys. Finish it please.,8
Time to rock and roll,2
missing :(,1
Who's bowling last over?,2
The commentators are going about a PC way of saying Shaw is a poor fielder to be patrolling those part of the boundaries.,2
I thought Shaw was going to be a generational player like Sachin. He was being prepped since he was kid playing in England too. Still has a lot of time on his hand though,9
omg dot balls.. keep going nortje sweetie you can do this,9
"Lol, crowd groaning at the ball tracking",13
Fake Crowd : ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. So close.,12
Kieron has..... a gut,3
Why why is this match so unnecessarily close,17
"C    H    O    K    E

Iyer with that cap style looks like a teenager lol,3
Not a single tuk tuk player in MI. That's how you win. Otherwise u get fucked,12
fucking pissed at sky and kishan.,6
"Come on nokia boi, knock those stumps out",3
"Delhi has an excellent team and regardless of this game I think they will make it to the knockouts easy. 

They need Pant back at 4 however; without him DC's relative scarcity of power hitting options looks worse. Having said that, Pant for Rahane is the only change they should make. Carey over Hetmyer addresses that lower order problem imo.

Mumbai simply look very strong. Anything can happen in knockouts but they seem to have all bases covered and even the bench is one of the strongest on the circuit right now.",8
2 batsman on drugs are at the crease....did you guys saw those memes...,8
Pollys plaging too conservative,3
Virender Sharma is man of the match for not taking the ultra edge,27
I love Swann shitting on anything and everything he can.,9
Wtf I‚Äôm scared again,7
I really like this 3rd umpire..doesn't give af for ultraedge if it's straight forward,25
I'm really nervous about these two trying to take the game to the final over.,5

15 more runs and we might've struggled. Thanks Dhawan.,9

Just imagine DC with much better fielding..... they'll be favourites I guess,4
yorker pls,2
Fricking finish it already,4
"I hate Iyer as captain so much, really wastes the main bowlers.",-11
POLLARD LOL,2
I think this is the difference between good and great players. Going for the glory shots when singles would do,5
Why is the field so defensive?,7
"Ambanis - MI if you pull a KXI here, I'm gonna personally come and dildo fuck SKY, IK and all you cocky mfers.",2
ffs this didn't have to be so close.,9
Pollard run goddamit!,1
Nortje is the find of this season,17
Ngidi is the only bowler to dismiss Pollard this year in the IPL. That was in the first game of the season. Pollard is too good.,20
tbh r/cricket mentality: if have bat... why not smash...?,32
Mi & dc camp :- *goti muh me*,18
More nervous at 7 of 7 than I‚Äôve been for 20 of 7 in the past,27
Hit a six,3
Ponting writing in his notepad : beat the shit out of Dhawan,48
"3 choices for last over - Axar,Harshal & Stoinis. Pick your poison!",11
"Yar, if we had a Rabada over pending. I'd still hope. None now.",11
fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me,7
Stoinis to bowl the last?,3
"Man this match is so much closer than it should have been lol ..... great bowling by DC, and some awful batting by our middle order..... Hardik has been straight trash this IPL so far.",1
Oh boi.,3
How are these matches so close,4
"- MI beats DC today

- [IF] Finals is MI vs DC

- DC beats MI 

There is bank to be made on this trade if these two teams meet in the finals.

PS: Winning the finals doesn't meat you're the best team on paper (DC < MI on paper).",6
What an over,9
How many runs did DC lose in the field due to shaw? I watched atleast 9,5
Why just why save it for last over.....,4
"People asking why hardik was sent above Pollard, it's probably the running. Running between the wickets is really important rn",2
What the fucckkkkk what‚Äôs the POINT of this,4
Who bowls the last over? Stoin?,2
Iyer should just stick to his day job of being a scientist,6
Ok but really though.,2
Rohit winning from everyone but lost to Dhoni and Kohli is Peak Indian Cricket for some reason...,6
Fuck noooooo,1
YAAR YE BSDK KO PHONE NUMBER DEDO KOI,2

Nortje is phenomenal,4
[removed],8
MI should have won this game an over ago. They are now in dangerous position.,7
"This has been more of failure of the captaincy of Iyer. Bad field placements, getting the wrong bowlers in at the wrong time.

You need to place your good fielders at the boundary.",4
this could‚Äôve been over in the 18th...,4
Beaten by brutal pace ü§ïüî•üî•,3
One super over to go please...,1
Just 4 runs have come in the last 10 balls,3
Thala Pollard,3
Stonnis bring in that luck,1
Axar with ultra attacking field PLEASE,2
Looks like Pollard has forgot how to bat,2
Nokia is gonna earn some green next year,2
"It has to be one of Dhawan or Rahane, so yes slow Opening will be the one weakness for Delhi",3
These are the moments I feel there is some kind of fixing in IPL. They take some of these matches way too deep.,-1
Wish Rabada had one more.. To spice things up xD,3
If we lose this assign us meme team cap,7
Nortje what a player,2
Stoinis is bowling,1
"This has become unnecessarily close, good fight shown by DC",9
Aaaa super over plsss,3
Mi taking it DEEP‚Ñ¢,10
"A little more intent from DC batting, esp Dhawan and 15 extra runs would have made this match a lot more tighter.",3
Ughhhh pollar pleaseee hit,1
What the fuck,1
"fuckkkkk krunal on strike. i fucking hate this so fucking much,.",8
"Bowl anyone, you lost this by not bowling Nortje, Rabada earlier anyway.",1
Not much NRR lost,6
Pollard pulling in all his experience. A wicket here and the game could have gone anywhere. Can't trust Pandya.,11
"If you can't hit Stoinis for 7 in the last over, you need to pack your bags and leave UAE.",25
Scripted /s,2

Dhawan's slow batting or Shaw's awful fielding - which one was more disastrous?,2
Superover please,2
I think MI will somehow bottle it,1
Can anybody tell me why Shaw is anywhere near the outfield?,1
Discussing where to concede the six,3
Yaar what bakchodi is this. Please guys why you do this?,9
Yeah just telecast all ads now,7
I really wanna tear into Prithvi but he's too cute.,1

"This is the MI I know, taking winnable matches till the end",2
Shaw fielded very poorly. DC didn‚Äôt manage the ‚Äúcontrollables‚Äù,8
Hung the stoin out to dry but there wasn‚Äôt much they could do given the situation,1
DC win will be as good as RR win today and KKR'S yesterday !!,4

Shaw midfielding again. Lmao,3
Why the fuck no one can pick up the ball off the ground in one shot,3
LoL. Prithvi can't catch a break tonight,3
Pollard became Jadhav literally this innings.,1
Good delivery Stoinis! Exactly what we needed,2
"Discussed for 3+ minutes how to bowl this shit delivery, Stoinis is just another level",5
Every season of supporting Delhi takes a year off your life. It's like smoking a pack a day.,5
Prithvi to DC: *no*,10
I would never pick Shaw in my team for his shite fielding,3
Prithvi boi will be having some spanking tonight,6
GG NO RE,1
Again Prithvi Shaw's awful fielding. What a disaster he is.,2
Stupid delivery from stoinis,2
"I don't mind Hardik batting over Pollard if we are chasing and RR is under control, Pollard has been playing intelligently in last year or so. Don't want Hardik and Krunal batting together",1
Pathetic,3
"Damn, what a liability.",3
Prithvi Shaw MI 12th man,9
Shit Shaw fielding strikes again lmao,7
Everyone and their mother know bowl short to Pandya but no we will bowl a leg side slower ball.,5
Shaw bc sleeper cell,7
Prithvi Shaw has had a terrible day today!,2
Yeah don't really deserve to win when they're gifting runs,3
"Bad ball

Garbage

Hot garbage

Stoinis to Krunal",3
Shaw is never gonna forget the scolding he is gonna get from Ponting in dressing room....,6
Even Im scared of ponting today regardless that im in a whole different country,9

Prithvi has had a disasterclass today.,5
Bada bekar hai prithiv toh,4

Prithvi Shaw,3
Ricky ponting is fucking seething.,6

Prithvi Shaw is the worst fielder in the history of cricket.,5
"Ponting: Ghar aaja, fir batata hu",19
Of course its fucking Shaw again,3
Big question for DC where do you put Shaw on the field!,4
LMAO PRITHVI SHAW BOTTLED IT AGAIN BRUH,3
"Shaw again, man is having a disaster of a night",2
Punter looks ready for murder.,5
"Vishnu Bagwan : I am everywhere

Damn scriptwriters do something,2

Prithvi Shaw really needs to improve his fielding. Massive liability on the field.,12
"Guys why did Mumbai's NRR drop from 1.49 to 1.34?? We won, right?",12
DC needs to work a lot on their fielding. And MI needs to not take every match to their middle order ffs. Good game tho.,10
So now can we have ponting for the losing captain chat.,5
"In an alternate universe, someone runs Pollard out and it goes to a superover.",8
Petition to break MI into 2 teams because they're too OP... Heck who am I kidding. They'd still dominate then.,11
Rahane can keep wickets. Should they have actually picked Hetmeyer?,6
what was the point of setting close field and then bowling a bouncer?,12
Give dhawan MOM for Mumbai,2
Any team other than Mumbai would have shit the bed today in this chase.,15
"Shaw was a poster child batsman when he was a youngster as he dominated when he was a kid. Now he's in the big leagues though .....

But he hasn't seemed to have improved his other skills .....

He's in bad shape and is a terrible fielder. His height is a disadvantage, but being in bad shape at age 20 is a choice.

I am not sure whether Dhawan is a liability or an asset,19
Shaw's fielding and Dhawan's strike rate are a real worry. They need to start doing better because Ponting won't let them play another match after the next.,24

Tomorrow is RCB v KKR. Looking forward very much.,8
"Seriously, people here have such a short memory. Calls to drop Shaw are totally unwarranted. He is the second highest run getter for DC this season after Iyer and second highest strike rate after Stoinis.",34
"Koach will beat MI, mark my words, coz
Angry Koach > World XI",15
Classic 10-15 short excuse by Shreyas,14
It seemed SKY and Handsome were intentionally going after Rabada .. even ifit meant risking their wickets.. I guess MI as a team wanted to send the message of dominance to him.,4
"Mumbai Indians are just incredibly deep. Batting till 7. Bowling is scary with Boult, Bumrah, and Pattinson. They're winning it this year.",17
Should make Shikhar Dhawan & Prithvi Shaw appreciation thread.,1
that stoinis run out was not dhawan's fault tho. there was no run there. why are people blaming dhawan for that?,15
"keep the Shaw away from boundaries, sub in a specialist fielder if we can",16
MI to CSK - This is how you 'tAkE iT dEeP',20
"In a world full of KXIP, be someone's MI üíú",24
I'm a Hyderabadi but gave up on SRH after their performance this season. Mumbai's always been my second home (in India) and their team is actually worth supporting. Well done MI!,15
"Mumbai is too strong.

Someone needs to stand up to this bully as a team. Individual performances don't matter.",6
MI's next game against KKR is in Abu Dhabi as well. 5 days from now. That would mean they would've played 6 out of their first 8 games in Abu Dhabi.,15

Bad captaincy from Iyer to put his 4 feet shittest fielder at boundary.,-5
"Gamechanger of the match to Shikar Dhawan. 

Peek trolling by IPL management",28
Dhawan winning the gamechanger award. Sure he changed the game in Mumbai's favor üëåüëå,15
Wtf Dhawan for the game changer of the match üòÇ,9
Game changer for Dhawan lol. Yeah he changed this game in favor of MI.,12
I guess half of us must have guessed Shreyas was gonna say the usual ‚Äò10-15 runs short‚Äô,9
"Lmao, Dhawan got the Game Changer of the match award and I couldn't agree more...",43
Let's hope this is NOT the preview of final. Don't want a one sided final,0
"Gamechanger Dhawan

Bohot hard",6
"This game really messed up other team‚Äôs chances. With 2 teams at 10 points (and three tomorrow), the only spot realistically up for grab will be the fourth spot, but the remaining teams would have to play out of their skins to get there.",15
"Ponting's team meeting video today will feature him saying 'If you want to be the next Say-Shin, you need to be a better fielder' to Shaw",17

Proud of the lads!! No wonder we are the best team in the history of the IPL.,14
Rohit hitting the nail on the head...,5
On what basis fo they give this game changer award?,3
nothing for my boy SKY? :(,16
"QDK took 3 lakh INR there. 

Wow",17
"Is it just me or has the ""prick"" quotient of MI drastically gone down post the departure of Harbhajan.",22
SKY has a higher SR than QDK and didn‚Äôt get power play advantage. Why is he not the MoM,15
QDK‚Äôs such a likeable guy,26
Where's the playoffs and finals going to be played? Plz tell me not at Sharjah,10
When Rohit is speaking it looks like he is a bit breathless. Noticed this in the last match presentation as well.,17
DC fans here being really cocky about being guaranteed in the finals. Even MI fans are not this cocky despite their team having won multiple times,39
"Mumbai fans crying about reduced NRR even after they dominated almost the entirety of the game. 

That's what I'd like to call 'suffering from success'.",41
"DC fans : I hope this isn't the preview of the final

Woah woah slow down there buccaroo",19
"MI fans crying that their NRR fell after winning.
RCB fans just want positive NRR.",32
I really want the mega auction to mess up MI. Sorry MI fans but you have to give us some chance at winning,-20
It seems like I have grossly overestimated my team‚Äôs ability.,11
50% + win rate against all the teams. üêê,29
We even lost out to be first team to lose 100 games to KXIP! Fuck this shit!!,12
"Ayeeee. Stop trolling Dhawan. He was indeed the game changer. Yesterday KL got the gamechanger. *inserts ""aap chronology samajjiye"" meme",15
Serious question: why do we play Harshal Patel over Ishant Sharma? We never need his batting but we can have an attack without any weakness if we remove Patel.,13
a win tomorrow and we'll have the joint highest points in the league at the halfway stage,21
"Impressed with Surya. He is able to score without effort. Amazing that he is 30 and has never been in conversation for a place in Indian team. Not sure he will get a look in now as well. Delhi bowling was not perfect and Iyer made too many changes early on. When it works it makes him looks like a genius but today was not day for sure. 

Mumbai batting is looking more and more menacing. Their seam bowling attack is great and have chahar as primary spinner. Definitely the favorite at this point.",32
"**Predictions RCB vs KKR in Sharjah**

RCB : 220/2 (Finch 105(55) , Kohli 80 (48) , Narine 1-48)

KKR : 206/8 (Morgan 70 (40) , Rana 55 (30) , Morris 2-45)

**RCB wins by 14 runs**",19
"All indian openers are playing as if strike rates are overrated nowadays. First KL, then Dhawan. Soon Rohit gonna make a 80(92) against KKR soon and KKR *still* gonna lose cuz its against MI.",26
People were saying we should stop IPL and give away the trophy to DC. Lmao!,25
[deleted],-13
"This is the 100th IPL match loss for DC, right?",20
"I did a lot of shit slinging earlier but you can totally see why CSK(well not this season so far but mostly) and MI win this competition a lot.

First off, their game management is excellent. They bowled Rahul Chahar and Krunal Pandya out today because the spin was doing the trick. Meanwhile, we did not bowl out Axar. Similarly, I don‚Äôt really know who is responsible for it but you can‚Äôt have 4 overs of Rabada, Nortje left in this game with the game almost over barring a miracle. At one point, it was 26 needed of 24 with 3 overs of Rabada and Nortje left. That‚Äôs criminally bad management.

Also, Shaw can get you to the playoffs because he will perform in 1 out of 3 matches while others can save you in the rest. But he is a total liability for clutch matches: very likely to fail against quality bowling and a complete liability in the field. It‚Äôs a good time to phase him out of the team with 7 games to go but this probably won‚Äôt happen to be honest! 

No idea why we play Harshal Patel instead of Ishant Sharma. Yeah he can bat but we never really need his batting. 

Overall, I don‚Äôt see DC winning the competition till they sort out such deficiencies in management with the other teams who are at least similarly competent if not better.",10
I also like having Pointing in the dugout just for capturing my emotions aptly during the match. Shaw‚Äôs fielding is particularly triggering!,24
This loss will keep us fans grounded and the team going for more,14
what the fuck is going on,4
