2020-10-22T12:48:09+00:00,,"I actually started a Rajasthan Royals campaign in Cricket Captain 20 yesterday. We lost the first game horribly to Chennai (courteously of Faf smashing our bowlers) with Smith somehow getting himself a long term injury and being ruled out of most of the tournament. After the next game, we finally managed to strike a balanced team which was:

Jaiswal
Buttler (c)
Samson (wk)
Miller
Stokes
Parag
Tewatia 
Archer
Gopal
Tyagi
Aaron

I found that while Aaron was expensive, he at least managed to regularly prise a wicket or two upfront, and anyway Stokes could fill in his overs. Speaking of Stokes, while he‚Äôs been solid with the bat he‚Äôs been an absolute monster with the ball, taking a wicket every match and almost never failed to break a partnership. Archer has been solid and consistent, Tyagi sometimes expensive but very dangerous and effective, with Gopal and Tewatia also being key breakthrough men.

We should‚Äôve won our most recent game against KKR, but even in a fucking simulation they‚Äôre the most shithouse team. Nagarkoti batting at 9 top scored with 45(27) not out to drag Kolkata to a respectable 155, then and bowled a wicket maiden in the second over to get Jaiswal. Samson and Buttler then rebuilt, but with Jos unusually slow, eventually falling for 41(39). Samson then counterattacked at the death but even with a six off the final ball of the penultimate over he could only reduce the equation to 22 off 6. David Miller struggling on 10(8) was on strike to Nagarkoti, where on the first 3 balls he hit 4, 2, 6, before getting trapped LBW for 22(11). Ben Stokes then walked out after taking 3/24 earlier with 10 needed off 2. He clubbed the first ball for 4 but could not get the maximum on the final ball, leading to Kolkata winning by 4 runs. Samson was unbeaten on 74(58) at the other end.

Might try Stokes at 4 next game",8
2020-10-22T12:48:45+00:00,berbathlicism,"Look how they massacred my boi David Miller.

in conclusion, kkR is a CHINA pawn which India is also but agreed to bcoz BCCI will be able to convince to bring 5th pace option to india tour australia to infiltrate australia and give them colonelvirus so that they agree to strong arms and ALSO become china pawn. u know how i know? coz this 5th pace option played a beauty vs kkr....his name is MOHAMMAD SYRINGE",5

The problem comes that Stokes is really still finding his way after being out for the best part of 3 months being with his family.

It‚Äôs a calculated risk, if Stokes gets a bit bogged down at the top then Buttler is still to come and in form, even with 5 overs left, he‚Äôll do his thing. If Stokes gets bogged down with 5 overs left, it gives all momentum to the opposition at the end.",6

11, 8, 0, 7*, 1*, 16*, 6, 11, 14, 12, 1 and 0

Honestly if he's gonna bowl like garbage, they'd be better off dropping him, opening with Sanju and playing either Miller or an extra overseas fast bowler. 

Stokes' situation is different from Maxwell because while Maxwell has been giving 4 overs and has been only failing in a firing batting unit, Stokes has hardly bowled and has almost always hindered the team with his batting upfront.
