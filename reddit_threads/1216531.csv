Yup. I am always 1st to comment on rr match threads,17
Hi we need to win today,6
Today we will witness beardless Lord and beardless 3D.,9
Rr fans will have massive heart attack if rr chokes,7
[deleted],7
Early comments of rr fans shows how important this match is,7
"All rr fans, are you all rajasthanis? Am I the only non rajasthani here?",5
Damn why is everyone an RR fan here,11
I'm here to ruin the RR flair streak,6
"Bro mcdonalds,dont send stokes to open pls!",3
"Beardless Tewatia ain't it. Shouldn't have shaved. 

Maybe his power is in his beard, guess we'll find out today",9
"Probably will get crucified by SRH fans for saying this. I wouldn‚Äôt mind losing this match to RR. 
  
Our chances have pretty much been fucked because of Bhuvi‚Äôs injury and we have too many holes to fill in our lineup. I don‚Äôt really feel we‚Äôre playing an exciting brand of cricket. 

But its mainly because of Tewatia I‚Äôm rooting for them, the dude is a superstar.",8
"You know what's common between rajasthan and RR?


Not many give a shit about them",3
"I visited my grandma today, and the first thing she asked me was if Kolkata had forgotten how to bat yesterday lmao",40
Who should neutrals support in this match?,2
"Rr 11 should be like

1. Uthappa 

2.jos buttler

3. Samson/manan

4. Smith

5. Stokes

6. Parag

7. Lord

8. Jofra

9. Shreyas

10. Tyagi

11. Ankit/varun",7
Is kane injured ?,3
I want Hyderabad to win this I guess I am just angry we lost TWICE to RR...,4
"I actually started a Rajasthan Royals campaign in Cricket Captain 20 yesterday. We lost the first game horribly to Chennai (courteously of Faf smashing our bowlers) with Smith somehow getting himself a long term injury and being ruled out of most of the tournament. After the next game, we finally managed to strike a balanced team which was:

Jaiswal
Buttler (c)
Samson (wk)
Miller
Stokes
Parag
Tewatia 
Archer
Gopal
Tyagi
Aaron

I found that while Aaron was expensive, he at least managed to regularly prise a wicket or two upfront, and anyway Stokes could fill in his overs. Speaking of Stokes, while he‚Äôs been solid with the bat he‚Äôs been an absolute monster with the ball, taking a wicket every match and almost never failed to break a partnership. Archer has been solid and consistent, Tyagi sometimes expensive but very dangerous and effective, with Gopal and Tewatia also being key breakthrough men.

We should‚Äôve won our most recent game against KKR, but even in a fucking simulation they‚Äôre the most shithouse team. Nagarkoti batting at 9 top scored with 45(27) not out to drag Kolkata to a respectable 155, then and bowled a wicket maiden in the second over to get Jaiswal. Samson and Buttler then rebuilt, but with Jos unusually slow, eventually falling for 41(39). Samson then counterattacked at the death but even with a six off the final ball of the penultimate over he could only reduce the equation to 22 off 6. David Miller struggling on 10(8) was on strike to Nagarkoti, where on the first 3 balls he hit 4, 2, 6, before getting trapped LBW for 22(11). Ben Stokes then walked out after taking 3/24 earlier with 10 needed off 2. He clubbed the first ball for 4 but could not get the maximum on the final ball, leading to Kolkata winning by 4 runs. Samson was unbeaten on 74(58) at the other end.

Might try Stokes at 4 next game",8
"Look how they massacred my boi David Miller. 

Run out without facing a single ball and not a single match since.

People keep saying his form the past 2-3 seasons in the IPL wasn't very good, which is true. But how will he get a chance for redemption without ever playing.",41
Today I want every RR fan to troll Samson to bring him in form.,58
Stokes will probably open again. Uthappa and samson need to deliver otherwise a low scoring game i think.,3
DEAD RUBBER,4
Which result would be favourable for KXIP in order to qualify?,1
"RR fans - Don‚Äôt keep expectations, don‚Äôt get disappointed. Simple.",10
Will kanos play?,2
British Royals vs SRH.,6
"Today is a big game for both teams. Whatever the result, please refrain from abusing the players please.  Players will have good games and bad games. It's a part of cricket.",2
Go RR!,9
Don't see any SRH fans here. Have they already lost hope?,4
[deleted],8
Sandpaper Derby Part 2.,8
Sanju it's cool that you've worked on your power game but it doesn't mean you have to hit every ball for six,6
"Since this match doesn't effect my fav team, I'd love to see either an all out batting display or a total collapse

Nothing in between",1
"Fuck fake RCB , Go RR",4
"Out of all teams, RR and DC have sensible names . Like what does MI even means?",3
SRH you've been to the playoffs so many times. Let us (RR) have this game,16
"Hoping for a century each from YJB and Stokes 

Thank you

And please don‚Äôt open with Ben Kenobi again Smith.",8
"Everyone talking about Warner vs Smudge or YJB vs Jos. 

I'm just here for Tewatia vs Robbie Uthappa 2.0",61
Which team should KXIP fans support?,1
"Alright lads, who do we want to win today?

feel like a coin toss to me",3
Which team do you think has the most sensible logo?,1
"If SRH win, Warner should pull out the Bihu Dance",25
"Of the teams which have defeated us, SRH hurt the most,           So Go RR, Stokesy get a 100 pls",10
Does ipl promotes regionalism?,1
"I‚Äôve been saying this since 2018 end but the Dhawan trade deal was a disaster. Forget the effect on the squad. Simply look at it in terms of support. 
 
We simply lost the support of the thousands of Dhawan fan boys who simply jumped ship to DC. We might just be the team with the least number of supporters due to the lack of star Indian players. Even RR has the support of the entirety of Kerala and Assam.  
 
Could‚Äôve just given the guy an endorsement deal or something. Team lost a lot of brand value.",28
">Looks like Kane Williamson has been ruled out. Mohammad Nabi seems like the likely replacement. And Aakash Chopra tweets he has not seen Jofra Archer on the field yet. Interesting

The fuck no Kanos?!?!",8
Srh should win this and their players must have dal baati churma to take revenge for last time,3
"Surely Allen gets a game now, SRH fans what do you guys think?",3
SRH fans why do you dislike Pandey so much?,4
Yeah!! Bring on the sandpaper derby,4
[deleted],30
I'm just here for Archer vs Warner again.,7
If there's no Kanos is cricket even worth it?,5
Warner & Smith in leadership role hmmmmm,6
Ayyyy Holder gets a game,11
"I'll say this, Warner's choice when he wins the toss seems the most logical ones than most other captains, we're just losing because we're not good enough.",10
Jesus Christ it's Jason ~~Bourne~~ Holder,8
"No Kanos.

I think SRH is going to compete with CSK for that bottom spot.",5
That confidence of Warner üëèüëèüëè. His team will win - my prediction.,4
"This Mark Nicholas guy is good, but I prefer Double Ds.",6
"SRH are bowling (RR wanted to bat anyways)

Holder in for Kane, Nadeem in for Thampi

Same team for RR",5
"Was hoping Holder gets a game. He is a decent bowler and can hit a long way too. Exactly what SRH missing in the lower order. 

Our top 3 are all overseas batsmen and it hadn't worked for us since 2019 yet the management keeps pushing it. May be Kane's injury is a blessing in disguise for us.",8
So why not Nabi and why Holder?,7
How come Warner be so overconfident/cocky even when we're sucking alot? I don't like it but ok,8
Why has RR swapped keepers? I thought Jos was first choice,5
"Ben Stokes will hammer SRH bowlers, he looks in good form, just keeps throwing it away.",7
"Ppl gotta realize that regardless of how good the pitch is for chasing, we are not good at it. Idk why we chose to field after winning the toss",10
"Am I the only one who thinks Smith got weird body especially his neck, too long like a Kangaroo.",10
Rr bound to lose. I cant see this.,3
[deleted],2
so we have one batsman less,4
So we are playing with 2 batsmen.,10
As long as we aren‚Äôt last I‚Äôm happy. The bigger thing for me is seeing young Indian players perform. I just hope to see another strong innings or two from Garg or Samad.,4
"Those quiz question are really easy, atleast have few tough questions",2
I think buttler should open when setting a target.,3
Would have preferred Fabien or Nabi for Kane. The fact that they decided not to drop either Pandey or Shankar for atleast one youngster is sad and disappointing.,4
How fast does holder bowl?,4
"Lord is enough for srh without kanos, kanos is like the titan of srh 

Lord was hoping for a challenge",8
Watch us break the 9 games streak of chasing and winning,8
Got a good feeling about 3D. I doubt he will bowl but might come good with the bat.,2
"So our options today:

Pace:
1. Sandeep
2. Natarajan
3. Jason holder
4. Shankar

Spin:
1. Rashid
2. Nadeem
3. Samad


Batting:
1. Warner
2. Bairstow",84
"Leaving from work now, Google says I will reach by 7:37. Should I hope to see our top order bat?",4
Batdeep Royals vs Bowldeep SunRisers,6
Excited to see Jason Holder bat,6
Why is kane not playing??,1
"All I want is one of our batsman to cunt Tewatias bowling, I don‚Äôt even care if we win",9
"Holder will be shit, you heard it first here.",1
I have a feeling that we might see Jos' first IPL ton,7
Holders batted at no.4 in the Carribean league. So he might make an early entrance today.,2
"Star Sports doing Samson dirty he is being consistent that is all. No rise, no fall",1
If RR wins today I will be surprised bc they are the least deserving team with CSK to qualify for playoffs...,1
"First time after 2018, our bowling is again stronger than batting. And ofc, our batting is absolute shit again.",4
Why don't RR open with Samson and bat Stokes in the middle order?,1
I think 4 overs on the trot by Jofra at the start is enough to set up a 50 run win by the Royals.,5
Can Holder bowl at the death?,2
"pessimistic SRH fans in the thread are not helping right now. I need to be mentally prepared for a defeat, this is RR after all",8
Holder in. Will they be taking the knee?,5
"No.of international captains in each side

RR 0 SRH 1

We're already ahead in today's game.",7
"I sacrificed so much for RR. Blocked my crush,stopped jerking off. I will sacrifice one more thing, If RR wins, I will not buy a new phone for next 3 years. RR,pls win.",4
"I was about to complain about our toss selection but then I felt Laxman, Murali, Bayliss, Warner together would take a much better decision than me.",5
"My guess for RR's openers today 

Uthappa and Smith",7
Which team should RCB support ?,4
I love the pessimism from both set of fans. There is only so much reverse jinxing that you can do.,26
will sanju do something today,3
Don't think holder is great at t20s. Nabi should've been picked imo,9
Let‚Äôs go SRH!!!!,6
The toss was the correct decision. Why should we enter with the mindset that we can‚Äôt chase? We can‚Äôt became scared and give up whenever we are chasing.,4
Is there a case for bringing Warner down the order just bc it worked ok last time and egos asode Warner is trash against jof?,1
Buttler has a poor record against Rashid Khan so might not be the best idea to play him in the middle order today,1
"Made Bairstow captain, and stokes vice captain in fantasy team, good? or I change?",1
[deleted],3
Jesus Kanos humbly steps down after realising that Lord Tewatia will be gracing the ground today with his presence.,3
"I know everyone says that both teams have equal chances of winning going into the match, but all it takes is one inside edge onto Bairstow‚Äôs stumps and it‚Äôs curtains for SRH",10
"SRH fans, 

What happened with Tom Moody. Wasn't he terrific for the franchise. Any reason why his contract wasn't renewed?",9
"Take this u/HarshaKing


No. of World Cup winners in RR squad : 5

No. of World Cup winners in SRH squad : 2


Edit : ODI WCs only",7
"If RR somehow wins, I will stop smoking.",4
"Fk warner being smart and not playing khaleel, lord would've cunted him for last time",4
"Srh will definitely hold Rashid for buttler, so he may come even lower down in order.",4
Is KW out for good?,2
Why they showing csk vs kxip highlights in srh vs rr preview?,1
Have a feeling Samson will score 72 runs today,4
"I know I sound like a dick, but kanos batting injured in pp, not running at all and making a 12th man field would've been better than this 2 batsman team",1
Should this battle be called the #Sandpaperslam ?,2
Jofra got quick hands,1
"""Some""son will shit the bed again",1
"Number of players with awful facial hair in RR: 0

Number of players with awful facial hair in SRH: 2",11
"Did they risk aggravating Kane's injury by allowing him to bat in the last match, the same thing they did with Marsh?",2
"No.of specialist fielders each side today

RR 1 

SRH 2

Now we talking u/AnantShrestthPajaMaN",6
The SRH management will get away with it but they were literally toying with Kanos previous game. It could have been much worse,3
Sandpaper < Fixing,2
Why am I still an SRH fan?,5
"Even if we somehow win this, I can‚Äôt see how this squad can win against mi dc and rcb, Punjab have been going strong too",6
"I always thought it was RR vs SRH for the 4th spot with KKR freefalling. Now after Kane's injury, I can't see SRH winning 4 games out of their last 5. Seems like it is RR vs KXIP then. High chances one team with 12 points will go through this season too like the last one.",2
Battle of the Angry Ginger Openers. Let‚Äôs fucking go.,3
"Thanks, we will have a bowl?",1
"Y'all forgetting the most imp.

No of Ipl winners in srh: definitely more than 0

No of Ipl winners in rr: 0",1
"kKR is CHINA drone confirmed bcoz eoin morgan=EA morgan=5.2crore. daddy BCCI will never let go of morgan coz he loses matches, see, not bowling lucky funguson yesterday but camping chicken patty cummins no intent to win at all after doing potty on the bed and giving mohd. syringe chance in australia. BCCI will never confirm this coz BCCI=ICC=PIG3 Overlord making KkR lose games so that kolkatta fans in high population density area stay at home watching matches to hope other teams r strategizing losing so that KKR come top 4 while daddy EA MORGAN keeps shitting his mattress. if all kolkattians stay home, more ad viewershit on TV means BCCI=cashcow thx to daddy morgan while preventing spread of colonelvirus in dense areas. in may, IPL supposed to happen but nooo, daddy CHINA give every timeout at home, also attempting to strong-arm Australia at the same time........country which is relatively COLONELFREE. it is in the name!

in conclusion, kkR is a CHINA pawn which India is also but agreed to bcoz BCCI will be able to convince to bring 5th pace option to india tour australia to infiltrate australia and give them colonelvirus so that they agree to strong arms and ALSO become china pawn. u know how i know? coz this 5th pace option played a beauty vs kkr....his name is MOHAMMAD SYRINGE",7
[deleted],2
It's been quite cordial on here so far. Can't wait till the match starts and the abuse begins lol,5
Sangakkara's voice is soo smooth...,1
Guys can u still use the sort by live option ?,3
Watch Samson get into form today,5
Sanga commenting is so easy on the ears,5
"Australian derby, game on!",3
Am I the only one who gets an urge to pee while watching intense matches?,5
Slow Mo Ben Stokes ;),2
"RR gonna smash 250 with Stokes and Jos getting a century each and a quick fire 30 from 6 from Jofra

YJB gonna carry SRH to 180 with a 100 from 80 after Warner fails with 6 (15) after being bowled by Jof

You heard it here first",5
Kane's loss is a big blow to SRH. Man was super consistent.,2
How much cunting will Tewatia do tonight?,4
Can anyone see this comment?,4
"""Some""son 17(32) bowled by Manish Pandey",0
"I would love to hear Sangakkara and Shashi Tharoor talk to each other, about anything.",7
"Do or die game guys, nothing to loose. Looking for some competitive cricket

Let‚Äôs goooo",3
"The moody English ginger opener is gonna smash a century today I can feel it


Not decided which one yet",12
Cougar\[Warner\] VS Kangaroo\[Smith\],3
Random opener generator not working?,6
Can stokes get his revenge on SRH?,6
"RR: Have one of the best openers and also one of the best clutch finishers in the world

RR: Haha Stokes opening goes brrr",11
Please make this a 200+ match. Its been a while.,3
"They should bowl out Sandeep in 1 opening spell like Dhoni does with Chahar, anyone else agree?",6
Am I the only one disappointed that Fabian Allen hasn't gotten a game yet,6
The trend of Hot girl for number one still follows....,5
Bruh why stokes again. Collapse incoming,5
Top two teams of 2018 are last two teams of 2020 RN. LMAO,10
fuck I‚Äôm nervous now,5
Welcome to the Sandpaper Darby,7
Ben chod,4
Picking Holder over Nabi and Allen just shows how much SRH overestimated their pace bowling at the auction.,4
"Damn, so do they get absolute 10/10 attractive girls for the countdown to the match?",7
"Who is the better t20 batsman, Nabi or Holder?",3
RR management is shit. They are wasting Buttler's form,9
"Probably two of my favourite teams, looking forward to this",5
Ffs why open with Stokes when you have the bloke who *actually* opens for England in your team as well,51
[removed],7
Why no Williamson!,3
"Without kane mama, our batting sucks big time. He was the one who was carrying our non existent middle order. I don't have any hopes guys.",5
What happened to Kane Williamson? Is he injured?,2
"I have a strong feeling that KKR, KXIP and One team who wins today will end up with 14 points and it will be on NRR at the end.",7
Buttler should be opening anyway but it would make even more sense today considering his bad record against Rashid,6
I would have surprised RR by giving 1st over to Rashid.,2
[deleted],5
Sandy going dandy with his swing,2
Take the review you cowards /s,2
Why is Kane not playing?,0
No kahleel so they have to play holder in the pp,1
I wonder if Sandy's lack of pace accentuates his swing. He really makes the new ball talk,1
"It feels absolutely criminal that Buttler doesnt open. In T20s he is a fuckin beast, would explode in the PP as he did against us",1
Rajasthan has the nicest jersey of any team in the past 4-5 years,6
"Commentator shitting on holder, hope he becomes the difference as Morris was to RCB",8
Srh's batting lineup is thinner than my will to live,5
Jason with the new ball? Interesting,3
Anyone know where you can check a bowlers average pace? Say I want to check how quick Woakes is,4
"Dang, Kane out with an injury? Shocking",2
"Wait Holder's playing. Let's goooo, I love watching him bowl",3
Bc kaise khel raha hai tu,1
Uthappa plays 1-2 good innings the entire season and then goes missing in the rest of the matches.,2
Completely forgot Holder was at SRH ngl,3
"Q: What is short form of Ullu Ka Pattha?

A: Robin Utthapa",4
Not getting a great feeling about RR today.,1
Surely Jos isn't coming in at 5...,6
RR's logo still looks classy. Tell me again who came up with this pink bs?,5
Shubman Uthappa,5
Robbie back to his tuk tuk form,2
"Ok it‚Äôs not easy ik but o feel like if you are 6.7, 140 km doesn‚Äôt seem like a super hard task?",5
Was Williamson dropped because injury of last game?,2
The 2022 mega auction is gonna suck for SRH,3
The best Test all-rounder vs the best test all-rounder according to ICC rankings playing a full on Test match here.,3
Holder finally brings variation to our bowling line up. We don‚Äôt just have mechanical pie chuckers,8
Robbie looking in great touch today!,6
Kane Williamson is just as good as Dhoni also remember brilliant wicketkeeping of Dhoni adds more to him,1
"There have been no Hat tricks this year, right?",5
Ah yes proper test match lenghts,2
"First time hearing Sanga for a full game. WOW, he makes the commentators around him look so bad. He is on another level.",14
Murali Karthik just shut up pls,2
"I think IPL should put a new rule that for 4-5 matches 5 non Indian players can be in your lineup. 

Since 5 players for all matches is not suitable. It can make matches more interesting and competitive.",1
One of the only dugouts that holder can be in where there is someone taller than him,4
SRH and CSK are gonna be fucked next season if mega auction is only in 2022,7
Uthappa is one of the most elegant players to watch when he's playing good,4
"Seeing the fragile middle order, I feel Rashid should open with Warner /Baistow to see off Archer or smash it like Narine",3
"Is Billy Stanelake not around this time? Looking at what pace bowlers are doing this ipl, he should've gotten his chance today.",2
"Robbie is a much diminished player now but the Indian T20 team kinda shafted him.  
He was great for us (KKR) and I for one really expected him to make the squad for the 2016 ICC WT20 as backup opener. In the end they picked up Rahane and I still feel that Uthappa would've been a better call",3
Joffra ArcHER and Jason HoldHER. Coincidence. I think so.,8
"Someone pointed out to me that whenever Pandey plays a long innings, they lose. I hope he scores a good 50!",3
I love Sanga's accent,1
Rona band kar Murali Kartik. Nahi khilana unko Nabi ko. Chup chap commentary kar,9
Jesus Christ that shot,3
The lord has shaved???!?,0
Wow that was beautiful,5
is kane still injured?,3
Damn anyone get attached to players even tho they don‚Äôt play a single game. Liek I never want to drop nabi even tho he hasn‚Äôt played a lot yet,4
Fuck that was clean,1
I think we‚Äôve got that the commentators wouldn‚Äôt have picked holder by now,4
How many teams would Nabi start in? Shame SRH can‚Äôt fit him and Rashid. He probably would‚Äôve been today had Bhuvi still been fit,4
After Siraj yesterday its going to be a Robbie 100 today,4
Robbie plays some classy shots,1
Uthappa better than Finch,7
Srh has completely fallen apart after bhuvi left,9
It feels odd watching 6‚Äô6‚Äù bowler not bowling 145+,5
Really beautiful flick for 6 that tbf,3
And to think that they demoted Robbie down the order lmao.,7
Does Rashid have the potential to become a batsmen for us too? He has the power and can strike the bowl from the middle of the bat.,6
Which team should KXIP fan support,2
"I can see this game being a bit of a snooze fest, I hope not but I just have a feeling",2
[deleted],5
A win for RR will take them to 4th place,5
Ben Stokes needs to be snub the things he learned from Thala at Rising Pune Supergiant though he won a world cup because of his tips,6
Wow that sure is Unacademy Cracking Six.,7
Why didn't Stokes extend the bat,3
"Now that I think of it, with Warner out of form bairstow not living up to his reputation, our batting is full of tailenders",7
Ffs uthappa pls not today,5
Uthappa 100 today,7
Going from KP to Sangakkara on comms is like going from McDonalds to a gourmet restaurant,4
"Robbie Buttler should open, it is not that hard RR",5
Stanlake should have been playing when bhuvi got injured.,5
"Ah shit , it begins",8
"The only chance we have is if Pandey and Shankar start popping off.

So see y‚Äôall next season",11
Robin üòçüòçüòç,5
Yes Uthappa.,3
Is it me or does Yes Bank Maximum sound SO MUCH better than Unacademy Cracking Six?,7
So good to seep Thappa performance with a massive smile on his face,6
I like the idea someone suggested in another match thread that all those super fans for the sponsored stuff are actually screaming for help as they're trapped in a virtual prison,9
Uthappa is a poormans Hayden,7
Ravi Utthappa - Simon,6
Stokes doesn't even look like he wants to play,2
What are RR gaining by having stokes at the top and buttler in the middle?,6
That lenskart ad lmao,8
Robbie chill out pls,5
Robbie is connecting well today,4
Lmao that lenskart ad just showed Uthappa's catch being dropped. Foreshadowing?,5
Best all rounder in the world versus best all rounder in the world,3
Koach will be so disappointed by this running between the wicket by his favourite player,4
I don't understand the obsession with Stokes opening tbh.,2
Fuck lenskart and their advertisements!,3
Do you guys think Natarajan uses his beard like sand paper for swing ?,3
"Stokes likes to live on the edge, doesnt he?",6
Stokesy üò≠,2
Feel like pure shit just want Boobie back,2
"Regardless of this season, would like Kane taking back captaincy and Warner playing freely. Kane is far better Skipper than Warner any day.",2
The luck is still in his favour Bois,2
"These two bowlers don‚Äôt look the least bit threatening. They‚Äôre simply too slow. But pace isn‚Äôt everything? Right. But we need at least one fast bowler for some variety. 
 
Notice how the only two teams without a genuine quick, SRH and CSK, are struggling the most.",2
That shot was uncharacteristic from Stokes,5
Did he just inside edge a lap?,5
Jonny didnt really wanted to catch that,6
"Stokes playing so aggressively, team instructions?",6
Lmao,8
Wtf,7
LETSGOOOO,3
Why are openers playing shots aren't they suppose to just play test cricket and get out quickly.,5
Bruh What,8
Whoo whoo Holder...,5
ye kya tha bc??,5
Bairstow didn't do enough there,8
Why did he do that,7
The players involved in that need to sue Lenskart for that distasteful ad,5
What kind of fuckery,5
Oh dear,4
That was Utthapa's mistake,9
These batsmen need to drink Sprite. Then they will do seedhi Bat no bakwaas.,6
Love you big boy,4
So unnecessary. Pure BRAINFADE.,9
Village running,8
Let‚Äôs gooo,3
Peak RR chaos,8
Les goooo,3
Robin wtf,3
Running has been atrocious this IPL,6
How to get yourself out 101,7
Fucking idiotic running.,3
Stokes looks pissed off today,7
Kxip fans who do we need to support today?,5
Why didn't Uthappa dive?,7
AYO NO 3RD UMP SOMEONE CALL SWANN,23
"Well that was fucking stupid wasn‚Äôt it,..",16
Uthappa stresses me out so much lol,7
Dead face Smith lmao,6
That was brain-dead running from Robin,7
Hodor..Hold the Door,16
Good throw as well,9
"**3.3** Holder to Stokes, OUT,  **30-1**

RV Uthappa run out (Holder) 19 (13b 2x4 1x6) SR: 146.15",1
Whats with the stupid run-outs in the past few games?,5
Samson out before 19:55 ?,3
Uthappa turned like a truck. Brain dead noobda. Was there even a run???,3
so many stupid runouts,3
"In the battle of all rounders, poor Uthappa got suffered /s",2
Letzoooo,1
WHY DID HE DO THAT,3
Robbie you colossal melon,4
Finally an umpire who didn't go to the 3rd umpire for a clear runout.,1
"Srh ü§ùRunouts

When the bowling is too trash to get wickets",6
4 weird doodles,1
"Uthappa turning slower than a truck, Harry Maguire ka bhi baap hai yeh toh",3
Uthappa tried to pull an Uthappa but Stokesy hit him with a no u,1
"So Samson, how early are we planning to get out today",1
RR's running between wickets is horrendous.,3
"Nothing new here, we have seen several times Uthappa getting run out.",1
Rr collapse incoming,3
How long did it take him to turn around lmao,7
Cheeky Ben.,2
First direct hit of the tournament?,1
Unhappy taking lessons from the Riasbh Pant school of running between the wickets,1
Mr. Consistent has arrived to the crease,5
Damn that was a quick release with those long Windies arms!,5
SamsOff incoming,2
Robbie became robin againf ?,8
Commentators went from great powerplay bowler to not enough pace to open the bowling. Great going guys,7
Whatever Uthappa is taking for that extra performance is showing its side effects,5
Just when I thought Uthappa is playing well ...,4
"Robbie part time duty as a batsman is over, now it‚Äôs time to do his full time job of cricket analyst",5
Stokes is such a excellent middle order batsman. RR should open with Buttler and Robbie. Stokes can play at 4 . There are wasting his services here,8
First time I've seen a run out not go to 3rd umpire,7
Uthappa is batting well and in form. What a ridiculous thing to do,6
Inb4 samson 6(2),4
Samson stokes gone before 6 over ends,1
They were going so well and find the way to fuck up outta nowhere.,2
Robbie with his fat ass took 2 seconds to turn and run,9
Poor Uthappa. Just started middling some and gets run out. Bad luck Brian in cricket.,8
Samson scroe prediction?,4
RR find the most stupidest ways to throw away wickets,6
Mr inconsistent.,1
It was looking at good for RR,1
Robin padikkal,3
Why does the music playing in the Stadium remind me of Kakyoin‚Äôs theme?,2
Samson is as good as gone. Devereux will need to do something now that Uthappa is gone. He was actually looking good today.,4
"There was no run there.  He's a big unit, cant change direction that quickly",16
The beauty of the IPL in football terms can be sometimes described as going from Champions League level to Conference level,8
That runout is a disgrace,3
Please get out of the PP without loosing another wicket.,4
Anti Michael hussey,4
"Time for Sanju Samson‚Äôs six that gives RR hope until he loses his wicket in the same over!ü§£ü§£

Edit- Might have been a longer journey today but the destination is still the same!",51
Will RR lose 3 quick wickets again?,9
"Oh crap the man is out, troll time",8
Nazar Ghati Durghatna Ghati,8
holy fuck how tall is Holder,9
I yelped at that throw from Holder,1
Robbie: I am the one with the force and the force is with me.,5
Uthappa and Karthik are prone to getting run outs in this fashion. They have poor understanding of rotating the strike.,5
Uthappa was the imposter always trying to get the other batsman run out. Stokes saw through that,4
In before Samson 15 of 6,6
One six wonder batsman on the crease,7
Episode 120 of Whether Samson will show any batting maturity,7
You guys are gonna bully Samson into form please stop,7
Sanju in to make his 8 runs,11
Samson prediction: will hit Rashid for a six and get out in the same over,7
Samson 150* incoming,4
Why do feel like Samson is going to get out every time he comes out to bat!,3
It's the day to meme Sanju Samson back into form.,9
Why did they decide to send Stokes opening and not Buttler?,7
Samson 7(5). One six and a single.,3
RR should just open with Lord Tewatia and he will score 720* (120).,14
Buttler at 5 makes fuck all sense,8
[deleted],15
Come on Dunlop Samson (sandshoe),1
"Damn, stokes almost messed up.",5
You know why SRH is such a weird team. If Holder comes up with some extraordinary form then they'll scratch their head next match coz they need Kane but they can't drop Holder.,6
[deleted],7
Samson wickets coming anytime now,3
Will Sundeep bowl another or Nattu?,3
Who needs to win in this match for csk to get out?,4
"I quite like the colour pink, but my god does RR's kit look stupid

I think it's the helmets, if they were blue like the top of the shirts or even a more pastel kind of pink it would be much better",7
Man that was so unprofessional from Uthappa,6
I find it weird that the Pant vs Samson debate is always framed in terms of who is the better batsman. Never in terms of ...who is the better keeper? which is their primary role,4
What is this horrendous running between the wickets lmao,5
Thiccboi has no sense of judging a run. Good that it didn't cost someone else's wicket today. \*cries in Parag\*.,7
I‚Äôll be pretty disappointed in Samson fails again today,5
I can visualise AB casually hitting 4 sixes in a Jason Holder‚Äôs over on 31st oct,9
Uthappa was looking good,8
Where‚Äôs Stuart binny nowadays,8
Too many blueish kits. Need a Matte Black one.,9
"Should srh give samad opening as a pinch hitter

Also mention a player from each team who can play this role",2
Holder? She won't even let me touch her!,85
r/cricket trying to meme/bully Samson back into form here,26
These Josh commercials are weird,10
Smol ground bully Samson,9
Tbh Sandeep has done reasonably well till now this season. Was expecting him to be smashed.,9
Does Mark Nicholas ever stop talking absolute shit?,6
"If you don‚Äôt want to turn up the stump mics IPL, just mic up Bairstow so we can hear him IRL shitposting at Stokesy.",9
Sandeep sharma bowling looks like spinner(ravi bishnoi with a longer runup),2
"Look I like Holder. He's led WI test team very well and one of the top test all-rounders in the world. But I were 6'7 with athlete physique and in the prime of my life, you won't find me bowling early 130s .",9
Who would win in a Warner v Smith cage fight? I'm saying Smith,2
Would love to hear Bairstow giving Stokes some chat please,2
After last night debacle I have lost my will to reddit. Sad,7
I really want Samson to deliver today!,7
Can ya all meme Stokes and Smith into form pls,12
"Samson: *hits a boundary*

Me: Redemption?",21
"already exceeding expectations , well done Samsung",6
Is that gonna be Samson's one good shot for the innings or is he gonna actually go big this time?,4
"Samson brought back to form.

You're welcome RR",6
Uh oh. Is it really SamsON day?,6
Are we allowed to call this the Sandpaper Derby?,5
"When life makes you Sanju, be a Samson and not a Manju?",7
"In some ways, Uthappa was very similar to how Samson is now. When he came to the Indian team he looked imperious with his beautiful shots. But somehow his international career was extra short and lacked consistency to score big. The fact that his highest score came in his debut match itself kind of validates that. 

Can't forget his ODI chase against England in 2007 though.",10
"Uh oh Samson's hit a boundary, wicket incoming any second now",5
Bruh Samson pls don't get my hopes high,12
Isn't it time for Kumbhakaran Samson to wake up again? Dussera is around.,2
"The Samson. 

With double digit score.",4
Where will the finals be played?,5
Shot,3
It just takes so much of unwavering resolve and willpower to watch a CSK/SRH match,9
"sigh 


Pull out the sand paper boys",59
DAMN Samson. You'll always have a shot at the Indian Team (despite your temperament) cause your shots are sexy,9
no swing,3
Samson going to make it 3/14 good innings this year.,9
Sanju Damnson,8
"Stoke ko choke karke rakha hai

  


T: Stokes not looking in fluent touch",4
Inb4 samsung becomes out in next over,6
I bet kumble bowled faster than Sandeep,5
Couldn't Samson wait another match to get back into form? Why does it have to be against us?,16
"Though he is being hit right now, I like that SRH moved away from their template and gave Sandeep his third over in the powerplay.",4
Hindi commentators‚Äô reverse curse - they were dissing Samson for being inconsistent just now lol,8
That four and the previous six are both beauties,4
So as I understand Samson is RR‚Äôs Maxwell?,5
"Is that Sangakarra on commentary?

And did they get him to replace KP? Because that‚Äôs like trading in a Rover 500 for Merc.",10
Manish Pandey doesn't get enough recognition as a meme player even though he deserves to be there,5
"Calm down Samsung, one boundary per over",12
dhawan looks brazilian in that commercial,3
"Why cakewalk, why not sushiwalk??

3d gonna get smashed,2
3D glasses on.,2
0/10 I want to hear the gingers get in a spat which gets picked up on the stump mic,1
poor poor bowling,1
Lord spared Stokes today,4
How good is Samson behind the wickets compared to pant?,3
"Stokes, my son, please",3
"3 D in powerplay.. 


Amen....",3

Rashid buddy that waas a chance,6

Stokes can't play trundlers lol,4
Sam can just play risk free shots and ill enjoy it,1
3-D player incoming,1
2.5D Shankar now. Beard is gone.,4
I think rr losing is slightly better for us since srh have difficult games coming up but i just wanna see stokes play well,6

Why is butler not opening the match ?,1
I like this. This is good. We are increasing our quality bowling options.,3
Can someone explain to me why the opener comes in the middle order and the middle order batsman opens?,4
Vijay babu with no moustache? I can actually hear the girls across India screaming *Nooooooo*,1
I‚Äôd like to see Binga analyse Holder‚Äôs pace triangle. Why does he bowl in the 130s? He‚Äôs 2m tall.,37
What happened to KP in commentary? I don't miss him though,9
Specialist fielder doing his thing,5
Guys we sneaked bhuvi in. He's wearing a 3D mask but clearly it's not gonna fool us,6
Specialist fielder,2
"3D has added an extra dimension to his face. 

Legit cant tell what tho",5
"Stokes is a classy player but like he's playing some ultra aggressive shots, not sure why. He's opening he can afford to settle a little.",3
Customary stokes 100 sr in pp,5
Where was Stokes batting when he scored that century for whoever he was playing for that year(Rising Supergiants or whatever their stupid name was?),4
Looks like srh paid manish 11cr just coz of his fielding,5
Gun fielder Pandey,3
3D was our most economical bowler in our last match,3
"How come 3D didn‚Äôt concede much,",1
3d will get some more d's with that cute shave.,2
"Are RR the team with the most lords?

Lords Binny, Tewatia, Unadkat",12
Ngl this is the least interested I've been in a game since the start of the ipl,3
"Pandey is a nonchalantly  good fielder.  
Great stop and then he has this *Oh I'm top of the class at the yoyo test so that's not a surprise* expression on his face",8
"Samson Innings usually-                                                                    So it begins, and now we will be taking a short break.",5
[deleted],1
"Serious question:

How is Holder as a T20 batsman? I know he is a good red ball all rounder.",8
yo wtf is 3d bowling really good or are they batting shit???,10
Finally a decent PP for RR.,0
I just remembered my dream where Rahul gave Neesham the 19th over. I might be watching too much IPL?,3
"Stokes joined the team late, so to take their money's worth from him RR management decided that he needs to play more balls. So now he comes opening.",9
"Earlier SRH used to struggle to complete 20 overs. We were desperately trying to sneak in overs.

Having more bowling options is a sign of a good team. We are utilising our resources.",10
3D doesn't deserve this much shit from r/Cricket . He is one of the humblest cricketers .,20
Stokes doing a Thala.,2
Udaipur was my favourite place in India and 3 English Cricketers. Big up RR.,10
Yorker specialist in,3
Nattu <3,5
Agreed,4
Wow this thread is inactive af(compared to other ones),5
Samson 60+ loading,6
Thala Stokes,5
"Fuck you new update. When I press ‚ÄúAdd a comment‚Äù, I want to comment on the match thread, I don‚Äôt fucking want to reply to my previous comment. Sincerely, fuck you.",6
U know 3D is their best bowler when he bowls over nattu in pp,1
Any thoughts on Warners mustach? I think he looks very different.  I just noticed he thick it was.,4
Areee areee 200 banana hai aaj,3
samson bats like an overclocked CPU. goes above and beyond occasionally.,5
I can relate with Anushka from Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Facial hairs can really make a huge difference in your appearance.,2
Shreyas Stokes,1
I would like Nattu's Yorker to go past batsmen's bat and hit those wickets.,2
"Samson is like James Vince in the sense that he's such a great player to watch and plays some lovely shots, but rarely kicks on to get a big score",2
"SRH made Warner a good captain, Bhuvi a good death bowler, Williamson a decent finisher and now Shankar a bowling allrounder.",9
Only if Natarajan shaved instead of Shankar,2
buttler should come in next.,1
FFS take a couple of wickets here... This innings is heading for a 200.,2
Samson looks real classy for someone who just spends 10-12 balls at the crease,3
"Why do people nut over a good cover drive compared to other shots?  Is it more technical than other shots?  Is the delivery more difficult to time or harder to judge?  I'm just curious.  Seems like a confident shot, played low so it won't be caught and fast so it gets to the boundary so I feel like I kind of understand...",6
How long before Samson plays that one stupid shot ?,1
Natrajan should shave that ugly ass beard.,1
"I'm going to say it, RR looks like digene antacid tablets",9
"RR after not losing 3 wkts in PP:

We're now in uncharted territory Bois",39
Yorker baba,5
Yorker Yorker length ball yorker yorker,4
If they score 150+ it's over for us,4
Natarajan‚Äôs beard is mask compatible.,7
Great powerplay by RR but these guys going on and on about stokes not finding gaps. He hits one boundary next over and they'll forget they even talked about all this. would be consistent with the commentary this season.,4
"I used to think most franchise names were a bit stupid...then The Hundred introduced the Oval Invincibles and everything else seems fine now.

Calling a team The Invincibles is basically just asking to lose every game and finish bottom.",6
"All time effortless power/timing the pants off IPL batting order --- Shaw, Shaun Marsh, Robbie Uthappa, Samson, Pooran, JP Duminy",4
Buttler is better than stokes both at his and stoke's original position,11
"When Samson crosses 25, he makes a 70 apparently",4
Another advantage I see of having more bowling options is that now Rashid can play more freely. He isn‚Äôt surrounded by part-timers.,2
The most depressing we will rock you,2
stokes needs a heavier and a bigger bat. bigbat^TM,3
Need stokes. Looks like Nadeem won't bowl with a left hander at crease,3
"4 runs vs 6 runs


3D >>>> Natarajan",2
"You know what, fuck you guys. I like Nattu's beard",4
Natarajan beard looks similar to how most of the people look while wearing mask in public,7
Is it just me or does parag bat way too low,5
"Stokes has got this. Just you wait...

Or because I‚Äôve said this he‚Äôll be out in about 3 balls..",5
"Sanju following his usual trend, score boatloads of runs the first few games, be piss poor throughout the middle of tournament, then play one random good innings towards the end to remind everyone how talented he is",2
Tactical drop ;),2
"Stokes is really good with the reverse sweep, huh?",2
That was difficult lol.,3
"Swanny has a point,  if stokes is going to play 16 of 16, he's not using the powerplay at all, is he? 

I'd rather have Butler do his thing at number 1.",2
They are going after Rashid because now there are no part-timers to exploit.,4
"Without kanos, even 160 will be a 200 for us",5
Why didn't he go for it?,2
We look balanced today.,3
"RR's batting is so deep.

matchwinners till 7.

meanwhile we have deepak hooda at 7 lmao",6
17 year old Rashid Khan with the ball. Imagine the pressure the young teenager must be going through rn bowling to one of the finest all-rounders in cricket.,5
Be quiet swaney that was pretty difficult to catch,3
6 incoming from Samson,3
Stokes trying his very best to get out,9
"Shit, all our upcoming batsmen are weak against spin except Smudge.",4
It‚Äôs weird to see these talented batsman respect a youngster like Rashid,7
Fuck me why is Rashid always unplayable,6
"We should never, under no condition let Rashid go lmao. If he wants to leave gift him 10 mansions in Afghanistan",5
"Yeah yeah Rashid scream and shout now, but you don't go for the catch when you had the chance.",1
Did Lara postmortem Sanjus Technique like he did with Gill?,3
"Butler has pathetic IPL stats v Rashid

Dismissals: 4

Avg: 1.00

SR: 40",4
I'd be pissed if Mr. Consistent is gonna fire against us,3
FUCK NOOOOOOO,3
Lmfao,3
Talk about living dangerously,3
Ben Stokes has been diagnosed with Thalavid,6
This youngster Rashid is showing a lot of spark,1

3Demon,3
Clown music intensifies,3
Ben just wants to get out.,5
Talk about luck,2
1d just reduced from the 3d player,3
Wtfff,2
3D lmao,3
rip 3d,1
People talking bout Butler not opening and shit but in the beginning they wanted him to go down the order? I dont understand what they want,3
"Stokes dropped?


Well I now know who the man of the match is.",2
English 3D dropped by Indian 3D,3
"Samson batting smart and Stokes batting silly, what a reverse",3
"Ok, look, Why do I feel Stokes want to get out, but SRH don't want him to go out?",9
"3D being an actual 1D

Only god level bowling",3
"Break the beard XI

Man! It's so hard to be an SRH fan :(,4
Give that man 3D glasses,6
"Fuck, 3D boi at least field well",1
SHANKAR WHERE IS THE FIELDING DIMENSION,1
3D drop..,0
Shankar tried to make that look difficult and paid the price.,2
How many lives will stokes get in his career,1
Not even 1D,2
3D DROP,3
It seems 3D forgot his glasses today,3
Swear that happened in slow motion,4
"dropped 

fuck u vjay but ily for those dots",1

Ok lets do Beard Challenge again Mr. 3D,3
His fielding skills went out with his beard,8
"3D, shit in all 3 aspects of the game",4
So much for 3-d player lol,1
Why do they wear pink tho,2
3d -> 1d,2
~~3D~~ 2D.,2
"Can't bat, can't bowl, can't field. Why the fuck are we still playing this year I don't understand.",9
Shankar forgot to wear his 3D glasses,4
3D U moron,3
todays a 2D movie it seems.,3
Maybe not getting stokes out is a blessing in disguise,5
Oh Shankar,3
I wonder if Ambati Rayudu takes a sip from his glass of wine and chuckles whenever Vijay Shankar does something stupid,5
"Lmao Stokes is gonna shithouse his way through the entire innings, nearly getting out every other ball",9

Yes bowl short cunt,5
Fuckin smoked that samson.,3
Stokes lucky af out there,7
Samson and Stokes would get out soon,5
afghan jalebi looks like he's gonna murder shankar,38
What was that stupid jump by 3D Shankar just before getting his hands to the ball (and subsequently dropping it)?,9
Ambati Rayudu watches that drop with a smile,7
(3-1)D now.,6
ambati rayudu curse,8
How is Shankar ridiculously bad at all 3 dimensions,40
Nattu be sipping on some York-shire tea.,5
"Oh crap Samson crossed 25,",6
I think Dubai's ring of fire headlights make difficult to pick flat shots,2
Vijay Useless Shankar,2
"Samson isn't hitting a six for the 

Six then wicket curse",1
"I think Stokes opens because on balance they‚Äôve decided Jos is the more valuable as a finisher and Stokes, when he gets going, is good enough to do a job at the top.

The problem comes that Stokes is really still finding his way after being out for the best part of 3 months being with his family.

It‚Äôs a calculated risk, if Stokes gets a bit bogged down at the top then Buttler is still to come and in form, even with 5 overs left, he‚Äôll do his thing. If Stokes gets bogged down with 5 overs left, it gives all momentum to the opposition at the end.",5
Lol why did 3D jump there,5
Stokes 100 coming,2
Chutiyon ki fauj.,4
3D shankar downgraded to 2D,6
Fielding like that when you‚Äôre literally gasping to make it to the top 4 :/,3
I think even Vijay Shankar knows there is no way he is going back into the Indian team now,4
Ik we just dropped a catch. But almost everyone in the team are decent fielders,5
Lol Shounen jump.,5
Rohan's acid is just kicking in,2
Why did he jumpü§°,5
"Any lurking KXIP fans, some terrible news... Mandeep Singh's dad has passed away and he will probably go back to india.

a smaller bad news but hooda will probably start every game now",8
Shankar is too 4D for you plebs. Why would they want to get tuk tuk Stokes out and suffer Lord Tewatia's wrath?,37
"Oh my god mark Nicholas fuck offfffff!!!!!

It was a drop just shut up trying to sound smart",-1
0 D catch drop by a 0 D cricketer,1
Listen to the commentators. Easy to take more shots at Shankar.,8
"Has anyone watched this video?
https://youtu.be/1iPxzaS8vrc

Maybe warne should be in the 11 based on how he is still able to spin the ball.",5
The only reason they open with Stokes is because RR doesn't have any other left handers in top 6,5
Will we ever have a Vijay Shankar apology thread?,11
Nice running b/w the wickets!,2
is there a pair of more unlikeable blokes in one team than Warner and Bairstow,-20
BC for single adding so much of crowd noise,1
Lol the match's been feeling like it's death overs already,2
Now a four for symmetry :),3
Siraj went against r/cricket yesterday. Is today the day Sanju does it too?,3
I reckon if these two last til over 15 skip smudge and bring out Tewatia and Archer first,5
Ben Thala,1
I've never known someone who uses so many words to say nothing like Mark Nicholas does,8
Comms are blaming the ring of fire lights,1
Glad we'll probably never see Shankar in the national team again,4
Do they specifically tell them to maximize the cringe factor?,4
VJS jumped on gummy berry juice.,1
Fucking vermins get off the screen,3
Rayudu was robbed.,5
"Don't if Murali Karthik there sounded jealous of us watching from the ""comfort of our home""",4
"Sorry, Stokes has turned on his wizard powers (see: world cup final bat bounce for overthrows, boundary tread to turn a catch into 6; Headingley bad lbw call, missed runout and like 10 sixes that went inches beyond a fielders' reach)

When he does that it's over",6
Some one remind me how Vijay Shankar got into WC squad,2

Stokes Ben sounds like Fafda supplier from Rajkot,5
3D should be kicked out of field,1
We need to bat deep for the chase. I tired of loosing chases with only 2 wickets down,7
Samson looks good doesn't he? I'd watch him destroy the Hyderbad Philistines every day of the week,-5
"It's not a virtual guest box, it's the next season of Black Mirror",8
I just can‚Äôt get over how cringy those Dream11 dancers are.,6
"I dont have a good feeling about chasing 160+
I'm ready to get hurt again - Michael Scott",4
Those dream 11 fans aren't as loyal as me. Please stop lying you sellouts.,5
The loyal fans from the comfort of their home ad they make the commentators do every game is so cringy lol.,7
Can someone ask Natarajan to shave his beard? Looks like mold growing under his neck.,9
3 dimensionally garbage,5
People will take frustrations out at Vijay for Rayudu being dropped but won‚Äôt question Kohli or Dhoni about. You can‚Äôt possibly tell me they didn‚Äôt have any opinion in this matter.,8
"If Rashid doesn't pick atleast a couple of wickets, RR gonna score 230 and we are gonna lose the match. No other bowler is not even remotely capable of getting a wicket purely on his ability in our team.",0
Lmao just saw Robin's run out. I have finally seen someone who's even slower than Harry Maguire on the turn,13

We have Shahbaz Nadeem in the squad. Why aren‚Äôt you giving him an over if wickets aren‚Äôt falling?,5
WTF is Murali Karthik talking about? He's spewing absolute nonsense. It's a double whammy with Gavaskar Jr. along with him.,5
Shut the fuck up Murali Kartik,6
Natarajan's beard looks like he's wearing a black mask on his chin.,3
"What universe is this. Just tuned in, hoping to witness a rebuilding phase but we are 1 wicket down!? 1 wicket down!!! Hoping to not jinx this",1
The biggest crime that I can commit... Please guess guys I'll guild you if you're spot on.,1
2D on now,3
Nadeem?????,2
Warner having a trundle?,2
"Has Stokes been sent out to absorb Rashid's overs so that Jos can feast on Hyd's relatively weaker death bowling?  
cause 23(23) is Thala level batting",7
Stokes is more BRAINFADE than 3D Shankar,3
"No matter how blockbuster player you are, Stokes at RR will always be <<< Watson at RR",4
All Mumbai's dickriders should be banned from commentating,5
RR given who they have in the shed should look for at least 180 here,3
Ben Chod get out and let ButtLure play,7
"Stokes + luck is a dangerous combo. We've seen in the WC finals & Ashes.

*Cricbuzz*",7
At this rate we might meme csk into form,5
Eoin never makes stokes open the innings. So why is RR doing this,7
Mahendra Stokes Dhoni,10
"Buttler died for this, wtf",7
So if Shankar bowls we might as well could've had a batsman in for Nadeem,3
why is Stokes an opener not Jos?,4
"Damn just realized srh has 7 bowling options

Am I dreaming?",2
Samson needs to go big,3
Agent Bairstow activated.,13
Now smith will come in and play 8(20),2
Aye that's there fifth bowler! Do not respect him. Please fucking disrespect him!,4
Fuck me. 3 idiots in the comm box,3
YJB to Warner: Yo mama so fat haha,4
[deleted],3
Don‚Äôt remember much but has catching been always this shitty in previous IPLs?,1
Jonny off to field at long on,7
What tip did YJB gave to Warner so hurriedly?,8
Benjamin is actually just spinning a roulette wheel in his mind to pick what shot he's gonna play,5
Bairstow snitching üòõ,5
"fuck it yesterday was mahendra singh morgan 

and today mahendra singh stokes",15
"In one season, I want an IPL team to do a social experiment. Try their absolute best to score 0 in fairplay award points in every match. Sledge the batsman after every ball, sledge the umpire/players/whomsoever or basically do everything possible to warrant 0 points.",44
Stokes need's to start hitting it,2
Why can't we get England team's stokes :/,2
Must've taken breath away from Stokes realising he's not the best ginger on the pitch,3
Samson to score a 50+ today,2
Stupid slutty Buttler died for this smh,4
"Just as well for the harmony of the England team and Yorkshire Durham relations, whatever YJB said to Warner didn't work.",2
"Wow, Stokes Ben completely killing the mood",2
"Stokes is getting frustrated, I see a wicket incoming",2
100 marks for I N T E N T!,10
"This batting lineup is so fucking stupid, you really telling me stokes is in the team to play a 100 strike rate innings at the start. Why not open with Samson and uthappa and save stokes for the end",1
Butler is impatient in the dressing room,4
üíØ for trying? What is this kindergarten?,6
"Samson crossed 30+ in the 11th match of IPL. Just blame it on 2020, such impossible events dont happen in normal years.",1
"Hey Ipl, Request for some drama right now",1
"Karthik was a decent cricketer, wish I could say the same about his commentating",6
Only thing that was consistent for SRH was their bowling and even that is not working tonight. RR can get 180-190 with buttler still to come,6
Ben stokes just wasting balls,2
[deleted],3
3D performance.,2
You have to hit Shankar. This will put pressure on Samson and the innings as a whole.,3
Bring Nadeem u coward warner,2
Don‚Äôt know how to feel about any of this right now...,2
What are you doing Ben 10,2
Wasted a good hittable over. Bring on Buttler ffs.,6
3D is now a good bowler wow,8
Kareena looks fiiineee ü•µ,4
How the fuck did 3D become our best bowler,9
Wow Shankar Bowling two overs cheaply? Could have got Abhishek instead of Nadeem,2
"Commentators : *praising Bairstow for running all the way to Warner to tell him Stokes possible weaknesses*

Bairstow : *Who just wanted to sledge Warner by asking ""You got any sandpaper left ,bruh?""*",30
C'mon not at all,2
Stokes has played 26 innings for RR and hasn't even scored a single fifty.,3
"Ahhaha we mememing Shankar but his bowling has been the best today

r/cricket deserves pay",3
Thala Stokes taking it deep,2
"I don‚Äôt get it though, if you‚Äôre going to bowl Shankar instead of Nadeem, why not just choose Abishek to strengthen the batting?",1
"2 possibilities

Either ginger will get out in frustation

Or he'll do a tewatia",3
Damn I missed that - who was getting fit during lockdown?,4
Stokes batting like Uthappa,-1
"Bc Stokes putting so much pressure on Samson, then he'll get out playing a rash shot and then we'll call him stupid.",3
Stokes not middling a single ball and uthappa got himself brainfade run out when he was hitting every ball so sweetly,5
"I don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôre even playing Stokes at opener 

Like there‚Äôs really no logic in that decision",3
Our bowling is so rubbish this year that even Samson is scoring in the second half of the tournament.,8
Vijay Shankar's bowling is what you get when you combine Shaun Pollock's accuracy with Glenn McGrath's discipline.,5
Wicket alert,3
Ben Stokes plays tests like T20 and T20s like Tests,4
Wtf dubai expo? Did the guys in-charge even watch the ad?,5
VK was probably just overthinking,2
"Rajasthan has Buttler+Smith+Archer+Riyan and Tewatia in the hut.  
Stokes HAS TO go for it now.",3
"partnership 47 off 46, yikes",6
Did Warner get a chance to act in any south Indian film considering his craze in Telugu states? I mean that moustache tho,6
Wtf Karthik wtf?,2
Stokes should survive so we can't have a JBL here.,4
Fuck me. These 2 teams are the most boring to watch,1
Oh Nadeem our specialist death bowler now?,2
Holder? Whose gonna bowl in the death? 3D??,1
Jonny was just letting Davey know his epidermis was showing,1
"Robbie gets out.

Spark vs Vada Pav tomorrow,10
cricinfo timeline looks a depressing sequence of dots ones and twos.,2
"Sick burn Karthik

God now that's a height difference. Holder is so tall,3
Stokes can't time today even if his life depended on it!,3
"So unlike stokes, just unable to find the middle atm",2
"So, is this a 160 pitch or what?",1
"Now that I think of it, I believe that Stokes drop catch was a tactical drop",2
Saving Sandeep's overs for the end is a death sentence in itself,7
"No one:

Absolutely No one:

Brett Lee: And the seam is pointing this way so the ball will swing that way and his arm comes down like this and the ball goes that way",5
"I think 3D is an alright bowling all-rounder, a decent backup to Hardik, but nowhere near good enough to play at 4 for India at the highest level",7
Idk but Karthik is kind of irritating(commentry),4
"I've said it before but I seriously don't think Stokes is a shoo-in for England's T20WC team

We've got plenty of batsman that have better records than him in the format and he doesn't really add enough with his bowling to justify his selection because he can do a bit of both",4
Can r/cricket PLEASE meme Pandey back into form?,3
How can someone allow Kartik to be a commentator?,3
"Tomorrow's game LMAO, there is gonna be some serious shitposting in that match thread lol",3
"Weird innings from Samson, not super explosive but also not out under 10 runs",4
Shit ball,3
SRH plz play holder against RCB (ABD),2
Samson fine today,1
Sanjuuuu,2
Samson doing what stokes wishes he could.,3
[deleted],2
Samson broke the curse finally.,1
50(48) partner ship. Great ODI,2
"Samson is getting out now, he hit is obligatory six",12
Why is Holder in he's garbage,-4
This.... Is not happening right now lol,2
Ok dude,3
Holder bowling looks shit,4
The one six done. Now time to go.,17
Stokes has to get some inspiration from Tewatia.,1
"/r/cricket fixing another cricketers life

isnt this the best place on earth?",1
Imagine giving fewer than 10 overs for Buttler to shine. Loathe Smith's captaincy. Should have sent him at first drop.,3
Someone remind Warner that Shahbaz Nadeem is in the team as well.,3
"I don't want to disrespect the legend but with the corona message before every call, I think I have enough of Amitabh Bachhan in my life to get annoyed by this Dubai expo ad.",8
Who's in the comms right now boys? Don't think I've heard him before,7
Yes Samson is going to get out soon. The cursed six has been hit.,100
Swanny has bad impact on Sanjay when it comes to altroz,3
Was there a tewatia doppelganger in the small crowd?,1
I feel like Sanjay has developed quite a bit in his commentary in just a few weeks.,3
HOLDET LETS GOOOOO,8
Lmao Samson is literally taking the piss,3
Typical Sanju ü§¨,3
Had me there Jason.,7
Why am i not surprised,5
shit why did I kinda see that coming,2
"Holder making the neo nazi ""ok"" sign",4
Let‚Äôs goooo,2
"I KNEW it! The second this sub starts praising a batsman, they'll turn total shit",7
Wtf. Holder showing the white supremacy sign,8
LETS GO JASON,7
Byeson,4
Oh no Samson. Just when we thought,2
Uh oh a 6. It's wicket time,53
Samson confusing everyone by playing neither a blinder nor a shocker,7
"You did good Samson, now rest.",7
"In fairness, not a bad innings by Samson. Good cameo",7
"I was just gonna roast holder, he made me discard",3
Sanju gonna Sanju,3
"Wicket after a six, not a suprise at all.",3
"Six and out, the Sanju Samson special",9
The wicket we deserved....,1
So stupid to make Stokes open simply because of right left combination,5
Y'all. Maybe it's not a bad thing we dropped stokes,6
"If they send Smith ahead of Buttler, we riot",5
"[I'm surprised people thought ""curse"" was broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jfydvx/match_thread_40th_match_rajasthan_royals_v/g9ni345?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)",2
Ja son gets Sam son,2
Buttler needs to come now,1
Holder's brain isn't the only thing that's big,2
Did Samson just raise his bat as he was walking off lol,0
"Non performing/Criticised player starts performing :

r/cricket : Ayee, We memed him into form.",2
Sanjay doing the Altroz ads reminds me of me fumbling through my presentations.,5
Samson played good,4
6 and out again. Samson smh,7
"**11.4** Holder to Samson, OUT,  **86-2**

SV Samson  b Holder 36 (26b 3x4 1x6) SR: 138.46",3
Butler in please,5
Sanju memeing himself this season,8
"Cmon RR, send another 110SR batsman to compliment tuk tuk Stokes",3
Samson go for the kill now.,2
Samson's Quota of 1 six per match is fulfilled. His work is done,27
Classic Samson,4
And the curse continues,4
36 at bout 140 SR is a decent job from Samson.,10
"Best and worst of Samson in 2 balls.  
Though I do believe that Stokes slowpoke batting had something to do with this one",5
"Did Mark Nicholas just say ""you can fuck me out of the park?""",3
"36 of 25, not bad",10
"even in his best day he is shite, poor lad                 /s",2
Did a good job Sanju!,3
Why is stokes opening? I don't understand this.,2
"Nas Daily: That's one minute, see you soon

Samson Daily: That's one six, see you soon",3
F F F F F F F F F F F F F.........,1
This is the last good Sanju innings this  season. Enjoy while it lasts,6
Still acceptable from Samson. Tried to up the ante. Unlike stokes who just isn't middling it,6
Buttler please be good today king,1
Glad they sent Buttler in,3
I had a feeling they are gonna send in Buttler with 11 overs in,1
"Murali: ‚ÄúAbsolutely disgusted with himself, Sanju Samsan‚Äù  
Samson: ‚ÄúWTF, no I‚Äôm not!‚Äù  
Murali: ‚ÄúThoroughly ashamed and wanting to kill himself‚Äù",9
Memed back into form? Bitch please!,1
Good decision to send JOS,1
Tom Curran bats better than current Stokes,2
Opener and faux opener.,2
"Smith should had come, Smith as finisher üòê",3
Give me Rashid vs Jos pls,8
Still a better job than scoring less than 10,7
Jos above smith is a good call here imo,6
"Poor decision to send in Buttler over Smith tbh, especially when Rashid still has 2",7
England's Test openers out there now,5
Sanju made 36. All set to do nothing for 3 matches now,7
Sunrisers Bros. Is hooda really that bad? So far he's had one good game and one bad game,5
"When life gives you Sanju, don't be Manju and please don't be Samson.",5
I love how the commentators advertise that car as if its the greatest thing since sliced bread when it looks like a piece of shit,12
"36 off 26, not bad, not great, much better than what we've seen in the last few matches from Sanju. r/cricket, our work memeing him back into form is done",9
Samson is done enough to do nothing next season now,3
"> CSK might make changes to their lineup for the MI clash.
Downbeat CSK search for missing **spark**

Off topic but even Cricbuzz trolling MSD with that title.",9
Ah yes it's England's best test opening partnership at the crease,38
"Samson did a good job. But with Stokes being shit atm, that's a bad time to get out.",10
Who's the keeper here?,3
Rashid vs jos now,3
If Sanju Samson can keep playing such innings with occasional failures and occasional success he will be a much better batsmen,12
Wicketkeeping ginger should have bullied the umpire into giving that out.,6
i love the last ball DRS wait - fucks the ads,7
Y‚Äôall saying classic Samson but that was a decent innings,26
Is Sanju the new maggi man?,4
"Cmon r/cricket, please meme the shit out of Pandey and bring his form back!!",8
Yeah even I‚Äôd put a wicket alert now,1
Beautiful,3
"Death, taxes, downvotes on a match thread and Samson throwing it away.",3
I saw spark in Samson's innings,8
Ben 'Thala' Stokes.,6
wtf that was so good rashid,3
"God damn it Stokes, didn't even redeem yourself",5
Buttler is rashs bunny so we might have a chance,4
Let‚Äôs goooooo!,9
Hell yaaa,4
Stokes out.... Not sure which team It'd benefit more,5
Wow what the hell was that ball.,1
Cmon beat the colonisers SRH!,3
Rashid has the knack of picking wickets at the wrong moment.,5
So Bairstow is Vice captain?,4
Ben Pokes,3
Well played Stokesy ü§°,2
"If not Tewatia, next over is by Nadeem",2
Give Rashid whatever he wants damn it,5
Beauty from Rash,5
Was just about to type two of Rashid Khan's bunnies are  out there.... oh well,4
Bring back Curran. He even bowls better than stokes. And hits big.,2
Oof,1
every team has a thala in their team,7
Lord Tewatia be like: Here we go again,3
"What's your favourite Altroz color?

Sanjay: Whatever is shown on the screen",5
That was amazing by rashid,1
why are we so average,6
Proof that you can‚Äôt play t20 cricket like it‚Äôs Odi cricket,4
Stokes has conned RR into thinking he's a world class T20 player,3
Lord has do to everything smh,4
"Classic SRH bowling display, this. Even without Bhuvi!",7
Stokes opening was a brain dead move 3 matches ago. Stokes opening is a brain dead move now.,11
Stokes gonna punch a hole in another wall,5
Rashid - Buttler battle yet to come,3
Yeah this Stokes experiment has to end. He's not a new white ball player.,3
I was *just* about to type on how boring Rashid's overs have become as batsmen just try to play out his overs and it's just the same more or less every over. And lo...,3
i'd like to see him change a tire in that tux,1
Stokes suffering has come to end,3
Stokes the T20 player is a joke,2
So how old is Rashid Khan?,3
Ben Slowkes out,3
Stokes has been shit since his 2017 season. And even that wasn't such a good season.,4
Oh Ben Stokes you stupid Benstokes,1
"**12.1** Rashid Khan to Stokes, OUT, double strike. Rashid gets Stokes. A long struggle comes to an end. Legbreak, middle and leg, turns in, beats the inside edge as he drives, and deflects off the pads onto the wicket **86-3**

BA Stokes  b Rashid Khan 30 (32b 2x4 0x6) SR: 93.75",3
Sanjay Bangar got the Wicket alert immediately,2
Stokes will be bought by CSK next auction,5
Buttler wicket when?,1
UltraEdge vaale ko paise diye hain to kuch to karwana padega lol,1
"What is the par score here? 160 should be defendable, right? RR is well on track for that!",1
first pretend to build a platform for Buttler. Then make it worse when he actually comes to bat,3
"for others 666 is evil, for Jos it's 444",3
"Thala is everywhere, just like god.",4
Thala-esque innings from Stokes.,4
How does a team have 3 openers and still choose a middle order batsman to open??,2
Smith needs to now bat thru with others hitting around him . 160 they have a chance against srh .,2
Was that a bit slower ball?,2
And you guys thought dropping his catch was a bad idea,3
Curran brothers are better than Stokes in the T20 format (both batting and bowling),5
Smith 24*(36) please,4
"Meet you in next season , rr",2
Playing Stokes as an opener and Butler in the middle is a secret ploy by Smith to destroy England‚Äôs 2 best players confidence,9
Who is suppose to lose for KXIP to qualify,2
collapse,2
I'm sorry but Tewatia this season has done more for RR than Stokes has in 2.5 seasons combined.,5
"Stokes, Finch, and Maxi hate the IPL man lmao",1
"Genuine question, if rashid was to go in the auction , how much would he be sold for considering he's still a teen with a bright future",9
Why can't they open with Uthappa and smudge like a normal person would do?,3
Stokes threw his bat and helmet on his way to the dressing room. If you watched Sachin biopic he'll tell you never to throw your bat away. Handle with care.,4
Reminder: Hotstar still refuses to give the people a Lord Tewatia sticker,8
"Ben Stokes?
More like Ben Chod üòÇüòÇüòéüòéü§¨ü§¨",0
"I expect Steve Smith to go soon, he's not good when he feels pressure to play shots. It's how he got out early in those earlier games",2
okay Rashid flexing,8
Is Rashid Afghanistani?,4
What is Rashid's strength ? The fast googly? for some reason it seems to work more on foreign batsmen than Indian ones,1
36(26) is the most un-Samson innings of all time,8
"Buttler vs Rashid in IPL
4 innings, 4 runs and 4 wickets",5
That flip catch tho Rashidddd,10
"‚ÄúSrh have got the game‚Äù

Ahhaha new boy corkey underestimates our batsman abilities to chuck games",14
The idea to switch batting positions of Stokes and Butler should be the dumbest idea of this year's IPL,8
Behen stokes had no idea how to play Young Rashid Khan from Afghanistan ^TM,6
did y‚Äôall see that thing rashid did with the ball?!,8
Rashid flexing his football skills after seeing Smith in last match,12
How is smudge against rashid ? I have the impression that no human can get Smith out with lbw.,8
Ben Thala Stokes,5
That was sexy from Rashid,11
Neat from rashid,5
That little move by Rashid is for the highlights reel.,11
Butler plz get out,3
"Imagine you live on rent , and the house-owner comes to collect the rent but you don't have enough money to pay the rent so you come up with the excuse that the ATM was not open. But the owner is smart , he says you can use Paytm instead of ATM but you literally don't want to pay any money so you outsmart him by saying I don't have Paytm KYC. But the owner says now you don't even need KYC to pay money and you have no option but to pay the damn money. Fuck you Paytm",12
That's a great ball from Rashid.,3
Stokes' bat must be a homophobe.,5
i cringe everytime the commentators call him khan sahab,4
"Cmon, end this experiment already. Buttler and Uthappa open. Cmon.",3
Buttler was like ‚Äúcan‚Äôt believe I survived that‚Äù,9
Nadeem and Shankar.. get the 5th bowler done with..,4
"Even cricbuzz jinxed it:

11.4 Holder to Samson,¬†**OUT**, Bowled!! Oh no! The jinx! ¬†Samson b Holder 36(26) [4s-3 6s-1]

Holder to Samson,¬†**THAT'S OUT**!!¬†Bowled!!

"Rashid to Buttler in t20s: 4 innings, 4 runs, 4 wickets",4

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,3
"Has IPL reduced their commentary budget ? Pietersen's gone making some wierd excuse, Slater's disappeared, Nerelie Meadows doesn't seem to be around either, commentary teams seem to be doing much longer stints recently etc.?",10
Lol Dhoni with an ad for retirement planning. Accurate,31
"rashid is a show off

/s",6
Why Stokes :(,3
Simon are you fucking serious?  Nadeem is a full-time bowler.,8
Open with Jofra and Tewatia next match you cowards,10
McDonald I swear I have to shove a dildo up your ass to make your brain function properly. Why tf are you playing stokes as an opener,7
"David Miller should replace Stokes next match, much better T20 player than him",3
"Why not send Tewatia to take on Rashid? Shield Buttler, and if gets out Smith can see him out. Then there's Parag and Jofra",2
"Not taking anything from players like smith, stokes, root and some others but its really amazing how kohli switches gears so easily between diff formats and stil is one of the dominnant players in all formats.",30
60% voted for Buttler at 5? Get the fuck Outta here.,45
"Ok, so 60% of the cricket watching population is as brain-dead as the RR management.",8
60% really voted Buttler should bat at five,11
60% people have 3 brain cells.,7
Desperately need a big over now,2
Bairstow and Pant are north and south pole of cricket sledging.,8
"Rashid Vs Buttler/Smith

Goddamn",6
Who the fuck are these clowns that vote on these polls,1
91% of the poll statistics are just made up.,4
Bring in Natarajan next. Don‚Äôt get tempted with Rashid Khan.,4
"To put it into perspective, Rashid has taken 12 wickets with an economy of 5.46. Insane",9
"okay smudge, go crazy I guess",3
Unlucky there Nadeem,2
RR management using multiple accounts to put that shitty vote in,7
What planet are those 60% on,4
"what school of power hitting is Jos from?

Sehwag school of risky lofted 4s

Gayle/Russell school of going for the fence and just cunting everything

David Miller/Pooran school of bat speed and timing

ABD/ Maxwell school of 360 shots

or a rohit/rahul school of utilizing everything",8
Shankar has economy of 3.5 wtf Stokes.,6
Sanju should just stop hitting 6s. He gets dismissed right after one.,2
"Rashid throws himself at a lot of deliveries but he misses more often than he catches/stops  
Fields for the camera I feel",6
"Most ipl fans who vote on those polls are woke generic idiots who remember only recent events

Fuckers declared pooran's fielding better than most catches and then rate mayank's catch higher after that",18
3D's been the most economic bowler for a second consecutive match lmao wtf,16
DOWN,4
Listening to Bairstow on stump mic feels like he just wants to go back to his farms.,7
Smith looking determined,10
It's amazing how Afghanistan has produced two stars like Rashid and Nabi so quickly after coming into the international scene. Hope Afghanistani cricket has a bright future,10
"Smith's technique looks awkward at the best of times, but looks even worse when he tries to hit hard",7
"Bowl the last over of sandy you cowards

Shankar can bowl in death better than him",1
One thing which star has massively improved is making the scorecard graphics look better. Sony's was a bit too striking for my tastes.,7
[deleted],9
Sometimes I feel SRH just wants to let the opposition ignore Rashid and target the rest of the bowlers. Should have used Natarajan instead. He has 3 overs left.,10
"Natarajan has 3 overs left.

Edit:- 2 not 3",4
"Buttler such a bunny he was born in easter,
Young Man Rashid Khan sent white boi for a twister.",6
Buttler and Smudge swapped roles. Incoming Buttler 14(24) and Smudge 44(23).,7
Massive Slog there,5
"oh no, buttler has to face another ball from rashid

okay we good",18

130-140 seems defendable if archer could bowl 20 overs,6
"SRH to opposition: ‚ÄúHey guys, why don‚Äôt you simply ignore these Rashid overs. Just make 6 runs. Then you can target our other inexperienced Indian seamers.‚Äù",8
420 D move by warner to bowl out Rashid before lord comes,5
Just made biryani from scratch. Lets fucking go,8
Feel like they should‚Äôve got rid of the Sandeep over before finishing up Rashid but can‚Äôt blame Warner for attacking,3
Guys which team has the best spin partnership attack in this IPL?,5
"Buttler survives Rashid

Moral victory",15
Smith is pretty fast for a guy that spent lockdown eating Cadbury dairy milk chocolate cupcakes,9
at this point it is better to play out 2 last balls of rashid smudge.,3

On great days, he runs through the opposition   
He barely has bad days  
What a player. What a find for the Sunrisers",14

"[Steve Smith in the team as a pure ‚ÄòRashid Khan watchman‚Äô for Buttler, T20 teams are going to another level with these specialist roles now...](https://twitter.com/BerbaSpinCric/status/1319295322498105344?s=19)",6
"Credit where it's due; really disciplined bowling from the SRH lads today, just 1 extra in the first 15 overs",3
Swanny‚Äôs talking about Star Wars and I‚Äôm all for it,4
"I think butlers gonna get out cheap today 

I don't want that to happen but that's what gonna happen",3
Which team to support today to get csk kicked out?,2
Is the fake crowd chanting 3D Shankar?,3
Big over vs wicket alert @ dugout,2
"If you don‚Äôt already know, Rashid is the most economical bowler in the history of the IPL",4
If Shankar is able to play 3 overs why not bring in abhishek instead of Nadeem,4
Shankar looks like a fuckboi with that haircut and beard combo,2
Smudgy is wild swinging again bois,3
Mohammed Shankar,15
"Mark my words, this over will be the turning point of the innings",2
"Damn, smith seems completely different from his previous knock",3
"I dont think ive ever seen bradley cooper play a good innings, the two games which he hit this year, i watched the games, but missed him batting. i think the only game ive seen hi best is the mankad game lol",2
1 over too many for Shankaranna,1
Vijay looking different today? Hairstyle?,1
"warner you fucking retard, what are you doing?",1
Boys time for some 3D smashing,2
shaking my fucking head,6
3D 3D 3D 3D 3D,3
LMAO WHAT,3
"Damn it Buttler, No",2
Okay I really didn‚Äôt expect Shankar to get that wicket.,7
Damn dude 3D too good,3
Shankar Anna!,3
Noooo,2
Buttler's no match for 3D,4
Shankar >>>> Kapil Dev,5
"Fuck,you guys memed shankar in form",7
Mister 3D!,4
"Gone, 1D is working for sure. Well done",3
Vijay Shankar - makes things happen,2
Lol Shankar Anna is OP,5
Does Warner go back to opening today?,1
So Shankar's picking up wickets now?,2
Get your glasses out and get in!,2
"2020 for a reason, 3D getting Buttler",2
3D BABY,3
Serious question - is Shankar actually bowling well or is everyone just playing terribly vs him? He‚Äôs been VERY economical these past 2 games,5
"Shankar bowling like every gully cricketer. No pace, no swing, no Yorkers just regular balls",2
Hahahaha. Another player trolled into excellence,3
"Hi American here new to cricket, why is Burmah bowling for SRH right now I thought he played for MI",5
Is it still wise to replace Buttler with Stokes as the opener,2
I like how rr fuck up their won batting lineup.,2
In comes lord. But Rashid is done.,5
Did Shankar just get Buttler lol wtf?,7
Holy shit lmao 3D annnaaaaa,4
Rr lost .fuck you McDonald,2
Buttler 9(12) BIG OOF,2
Scotty wins against Swann.,2
"Vijay Shankar gets memed a lot but he's genuinely a handy bowler

Bowled a very good spell vs Pakistan in the world cup too",11
Rajasthan's overseas players bar Archer have been so fucking shit,3
3D Shankar strikes!,3
Shankar annaaaa,4
3D: bowler who can‚Äôt bat?,6
~~3D~~ 1D specialist bowler,4
"**15.3** Shankar to Buttler, OUT,  **110-4**

JC Buttler c Nadeem b Shankar 9 (12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 75.00",1
Lord Tewatia incoming,4
Shit gets wickets,3
Prepare for the arrival of the one true LORD,3
What if Pandya gets replaced by Shankar in the Indian team and he become the next Kapil Dev for India?,8
"Vijay babu , u son of a üëèüëèüëè",2
Vijay 3D Shankar üòéüòé,7
Go srh,6
"Rajasthan dependent on Tewatia to bail them out again it‚Äôs a fucking shitshow. They have Stokes, Buttler and Smith and yet he‚Äôs the one who should score.",20
"nvm, davey is a genuis ffs, my curse of buttler playing like shit everytime i watch him continues",1
Buttler did a THALA,6
Lord time.,2
Oora mass,4
"That was a 4D wicket, he's evolved",9
Actually survived Rashid only to get out to 3D,18
"Fuck the timeout, shankar is in good mood. Who knows he might take a hat-trick here",5
So Shankar turning into reverse Hardik? From 3D to a bowler who can‚Äôt bat.,5
"Vijay Shankar you beauty!!

You can keep your place in the team.",3
"Jos has to open, such a waste down the order",5
I'm done with this team. fml,3
Pls we should just bowl Shankar or Nadeem instead of holder in depth,4
"Idc what team, i want yuzi and rashid in one team",10
Who is this commentator who absolutely hates the English lads?,8
"Buttler should be back to opening instead of Stokes, but it might be too late for RR.",4
It costed them just one match unlike RR,7
[deleted],14
Benstokes has to take the blame for the low score.,5
Buttler couldn‚Äôt play that cause he was blinded by 3D‚Äôs sparks.,13
"Tewatia gonna smash a 50 now dudes

MVP points go brrrrr",9
150-160 could be a winning total. Pitch looks slow.,5
I don't think we'll get to 160 now,3
The day has come when 3D evolved into 4D,8
Bhuvi came back disguised as Vijay Shankar,14
one shankar's Ds ‚úÖ,5
Evil Shankar is 69D,4
3D gave atleast 1D to RR,6
3D chess by 3D boy by Dropping Smokes and kill any momentum that would come later.,8
Send in Archer with a license to go crazy,2
Rr letting me down as usual,6
[deleted],2
"Stokes opening 30(32)  
Buttler at four 9(12)  


We move on...",14
How could asking our opener who won the match last game to come down at 5 be a bad  idea? RR big brain thinking probably,3
"Lord Tewatia, although we may not be deserving please take the opportunity to once again show us why you have earned the moniker that we so humbly bestow upon you   
  
E: Sandpaper Smith has forsaken you, playing Parag is sacrilege",8
Buttler took Dhoni's jersey after last match and did 9(12). Not bad!,18
Msk giving money to scriptwriters to get 3D some attention,4
The situation was similar last time in RR vs SRH as well. Tewatia took the match away and started the SRH downfall.,5
and the redemption arc?,1
It's already 3rd good bowling innings from Shankar this season.,4
Rajasthan team management made butler into superman now they want him go back to be clark kent.,3
"Vijay ""Pink Cunt Destroyer"" Shankar",9
LORD,1
"""Buttler failing in the middle-order is a big blow for RR, especially in this game."" - Cricbuzz.

The Lord Tewatia disrespect is SHOCKING",2
"Me : Are you gonna bat Buttler down the order once again? 

[RR Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLi5UUsxxM)",1
Jason holder said he was working on hitting in the power play. I think they might consider him as one down if they lose a wicket,5
"Hi American here, new to cricket. Why is Mrs. Smith batting and not Mr. Smith.",1
"Swapping around Stokes and Buttler is an easy fix, gets 2 players batting in their preferred roles and probably improves team performance as well",7
Man we have a very week bowling lineup. Only jofra to trust. We need atleast 180 to be safe,7
Curious if Warner would give Nadeem an over now. Nadeem bowled once in the first 15 overs.,1
I'm always confused between Parag and garg,5
I want to see Ryan parag over Lord tbh,3
Bihu vs. Kuchipudi,4
"RR overseas player performance

Buttler stokes Smith archer 


There is one imposter among us",3
"Stokes really didn't need to play that slow, 4 overs left and there's still tewatia and archer to come. Incredibly shitty innings",2
Why won't you send Tewatia?,5
I can smell the collapse from here,1
Is nadeem chewing pan?,1
"Best trade would be Bairstow for Smith.
Rajasthan gets 4 British overseas players and SRH get the sandpaper buddies. Perfect",13
I still can't believe how badly RR have batted with the kind of batsman they have.,4
That slide tho,1
Nadeem eating Paan,1
Rashid is an elite cricketer,2
Ashish Reddy is as plumb as the fake crowd. Shouts like a cunt when a fielder misses the ball.,3
I hope Dhoni brings in young players due to backlash tomorrow and they completely demolish MI that‚Äôll be neat.,2
Love the sliding stops Rashid does in the deep.,3
Is Nadeem chewing a paan?,3
Is shahbaz  chewing pan? Where'd he get Pan in Dubai?!,4
10D chess by Smudge to fuck up his rival Englishmen. Makes Stokes open and cunts Buttler down the order.,7
"Predicting 145 max from them. Parag had 1 good game, he's not reliable, and Tewattia eats up like 6-10 deliveries before he finds stroke.",6
2 Yorkers in the name of 3D boy.,3
I think 3D will bowl another over. Too risky to bowl Nadeem now,2
We were looking for bhuvi replacement but didn't realise Shankar was in front of us the whole time,3
Can't believe I am saying this but Shankar should complete his full quota.,6
"Hi American here, new to cricket. Just wanted to commend you on how progressive you folks are, you allow gingers to play the game.",16
Ben Stokes makes David Miller and Tom Curran look like good options,5
Shankar may not be performing with bat but his bowling has been good enough for SRH,4
Lord Tewatia vs Lord Shankar would have been a battle for the ages.,8
If only Shankar improves his batting a bit more... he'd legit be such a good number 4 for India cuz he can bowl as well,2
Wish Warner does a ButtaBomma dance tonight.,6
Would be interesting is Nadeem gets an over.,3
"They better bring out some fresh pitches for the playoffs, we need big hitting entertainment back",5
Looks like another 160. Can't blame bowling they are doing fine but batting is so shit we can't even chase 140-150 now.,4
Need 150 min,3
yo is the pitch batsmen frndly?,5
"Weird to bring up Anderson and Broad, AFAIK they have always just devoted themselves to test cricket and haven't tried to transition?",3
[removed],6
Just try miller once smithy,1
WhiteHat Jr? More like EmptyPurse Sr.,5
Wait what Sandeep bowling out,1
3d has so far failed in 1d ( dropped catch) but did well in another d (took buttler's wicket).,7
Why was Nadeem brought in then lol,1
Smith lookin solid tonight,2
Looks like Smudge practiced on Xbox Kinect. He is doing those hand gestures,7
"RR have the players to make it to top 4, not sure if they have the management tho",12
"Mmw, Sandeep be getting clapped now",3
Did.... He just say Anderson and Broad have played no white ball cricket at all?,9
50 Cent would sue VIVO.,4
Shane Watson and James Faulkner at RR >> Stokes,10
"Ben Stokes' 106.79 is the lowest SR among those who have played at least 100 balls this IPL

*ESPNcricinfo*",21
RR gonna lose simply because they refuse to send their boss man to bat,3
This parag is the cunt who danced last match isn't he?,9
Heard Something,3
lol even I thought that was out,1
Is the pitch tough or are rr not playing fast? The match is slow from a t20 perspective,1
Only day I want CSK to win,1
Sanju Samson - Exceed Expectation,2
If ben stokes does shit with his bowling then I don't think he really can justify his place in the team only with the price tag.,6
Braindead batting lineup,3
Lmfao I thought Warner was giving the Nazi salute for a second there,5
There was an edge,0
"4 overs to go, why is the lord not in yet?",2
What the heck,2
3 overs after this. Nattu will get at least one. Holder and Shankar are options as well. There is Nadeem too.,3
[deleted],0
Lmao Swann's Boycott impression is so on point,8
Tewatia should've been out here now. Parag is wasting too many deliveries. Tewatia is comfortable with pace on the ball.,6
Wtf are these 2 doing,4
Need some tewatia right now,5
"Damn, Swanny would be the perfect Boycott ventriloquist.",3
we didn‚Äôt take that review to avoid tewatia,18
[deleted],8
"David Miller hot tho, no homo",9
Fafs arms make me blush.,1
If this cunt dances once again Im'ma lose it,13
This Riyan has batting stance like Lynn,2
Wtf why are they not even trying to hit boundaries,7
Is the pitch tough to bat on?,2
"Great impression of Boycott by Swann lol

Pity kids watching the cricket these days missed Boycott's golden age of comms",2
Do they realise only 3 overs are left?,5
"Good over by sandy, sorry for questioning your death over abilities",8
Someone tells them that their innings will only last 20 overs.,3
Jesus this guy has a real hate on for Ben . WTf is the matter with him .,4
Reels ads are cool.,0
Do RR stand a chance with a 140-150ish score or are they fucked?,2
This is the stage where we lost the games previously. Last 3-4 overs.,2
"Stokes, Smith and Unadkat did well at RPS and were bought for big money by RR but none have justified the price tag.",7
Nattu and Warner chatting there like two high schoolers checking out girls,13
A bit Rishab pant üòÇüòÇ,4
"Think people are being a bit too harsh on Stokes in here. 

He arrived a month late, his dad was/is pretty ill, he‚Äôs playing in an unfamiliar position, and on pitches he‚Äôs not used to. If you know what sort of person he is, you‚Äôll know that he never gives less than 200%. 

Blame the management if you really want a scapegoat.",7
"Choose a poison.

Choosing absolutely shit non performing players in your team and everybody plays at their spot no matter how bad the form is.

Have a great team where everyone has a dedicated slot, yet no one plays at the spot they are made for and you don't know the position you will play at every morning you wake up.


Hello CSK & RR",11
RR have fucked up!!,3
Matches feels fixed when they don't  even try to strike,3
I guess 150-160 is the new normal as the pitches have slowed down,3
"Little bit Rishabh Pant

Lmao Swann",3
‚ÄúA little like Risabh pant‚Äù I love swaney lol,4
If only RR had a player who's amazing against left arm fast bowlers,1
Nattu has been missing a few of his Yorkers lately. He hardly missed any in his first games.,1
"Dugout commentators require a good Chicken Tikka recipe, someone to tweet at them to let them know please.",6
Warner resting his arm on Nattu's shoulder as if he's not a good bit shorter than him,1
can we get some uhhh fuckin boundaries üëâüèºüëàüèº,4
All of a sudden even 160 is out of reach. Always advantage to the chasing team,3
Pls I wanna see Riyan's bihu :(,5
The lone guy who is batting well consistently is not sent. These RR tactics are plain dumb. They themselves are finding unique ways to fuck themselves,2
Around the wicket full tosses are much better than what Khaleel bowled in his last over against Parag.,3
It feels strange to say this but yesterday's match was actually more interesting than this.,4
"I know RR played CSK 3 days ago, maybe they took inspiration from that and played like CSK today.",2
"Guys, Just tuned in. Did I miss the show?",2
Can't hit those for runs,1
"Stokes is useless with ball in IPL anyways.

If he isn't going to be useful in middle order, sending him at top is stupid cause he isn't firing and keeping potential match winner Buttler away from his natural position.

So, drop him and bring in Miller, I say.",1
"Stokes doesn't look in great touch, and that can easily be explained by the month long absence because of his father's illness. However, I can't help but wonder why Smith and RR feel like he is an opening batsman; of their 5 top order players in this match, I would pin him as the worst opener of the lot.",2
Why RR is playing tuktuk is beyond me unless the pitch is too slow,3
Daammmmmnn that's a buttler level shot,3
Parag is the GOAT,3
"I was a dugout skeptic but ever since I switched to it few weeks ago, it's been damn fun. Swanny is such a character can't hate the bloke. Considering how trash the normal commentary is, my advice is give dugout a try.",3
Nattu bruh please shave that neckbeard,2
Man these yorkers are a legit turn on.,3
Bounce one at his head Nattu..,0
Natarajan PTSD vs RR,6
They put Parag with 72 runs with a 111 SR on the Emerging Players showcase lol,4
Nothing wrong with the delivery but still goes for 4. Where's the justice for our bowlers?,3
"Who is that guy in rr dugout

He looks like a mix of murali Vijay and jinx",3
jesus fucking christ the way srh management showed trust in nattu over the years,3
Ffs I hate these batriarchal snobs,1
Those light pink pads look hideous ngl,1
Just tuned in. Why are RR 120 something in the 18th over with 6 wickets in hand.,0
Am waiting for whole sub to lose their shit if 3D comes on to Bowl the 19th over.,5
thats what happens when you try to bowl a yorker every ball and are predictable,2
"Imagine being captain Smith, and Stokes of all players is letting you down.",9
Why no Bangbros in this year‚Äôs IPL?,3
Parag looking gorgeous again.,2
Shitty bowling? Yes. Bowl something other than Yorkers.,3
"Parag Jesus Christ, you just surpassed Ben fucking stokes",9
Yorker is such a tough ball to execute. Miss it by a fraction and the ball disappears,3
See this is why the yorker isn't the magic unhitable ball commentators seem to think. Still won't stop them saying it.,3
Tewatia and Parag have outperformed the big guns for Rajasthan this year imo,14
Bawaal shot,1
Should have gone for a slower one,2
Why always show up against us kid?,8
Beamer phek na bc saini bhi vohi karta hai,2
"RR have taken lessons from CSK. Dhoni must be coaching them personally!

Oh yes, I mentioned Dhoni.. Kingtards awaken! Downvote train incoming!",0
Fuck man why is Parag after us,8
Parag ü•∫,1
Peanutrajan,2
"Parag, Samad are treasures cuz they got them pace hitting levers",9
How good is oshane thomas?,3
Parag > Smith ? (T 20),3
"""Ben stokes was impresses"" - He wasnt even looking there",8
Inb4 RR open with Uthappa and Parag in the next game,6
Same ball again. Smh.,3
"Wtf, lord shaved",4
Fuck...,1
Warner elbow on Natarajan's shoulder triggered me a bit. Reminds me of bullies from my childhood. F#ck them.,1
Time to do the bihu dance,9
RR‚Äôs spark works,1
Natarajan needs a slower ball,2
Parag fucking up SRH twice this season,8
Lord has shaved?,2
What a great shot that was almost a yorker.,2
"Parag is a great find, performs under pressure.",3
*parag*on of success,6
[deleted],7
"RR should retain Tewatia, Parag and Jofra",4
now we have Lord Parag fuck me,7
We can't chase 150 and now this kid can take it to 170 easy.,5
Ruined all the tight bowling with just three good shots. Great stuff.,4
The Lord has shaved,4
"In a team with Smith, buttler and stokes it feels like Parag and tewatia have been carrying the batting.",4
Nattu has bowled very well actually. It's just a batsman's world this.,25
Shaving that beard is the only reason why tewatia ain't batting rn,6
Somebody plz shave his neck beard,12
"Saw Ashwins interview with natarajan. Truly a really humble dude, only started playing with a cricket ball when he was 20, hope him all the best",10
Next two overs like this please,4
Tewatia looks 4 years younger after the shave,7
"Parag, what a young talent",5
Nattu bowled well this over but Parag played some stunning shots. Dont bash em,8
"Sorry Parag!!

I doubted you and wanted Tewatia over you.",4
Scenes if 3D gets the bowl.,1
Parag is a small lil man,1
Warner looks like an absolute midget compared to Holder,1
That is a horrorshow of a neckbeard,2
"Bowler takes the run-up                                                            

Buttler's shoulder : *I like to MOVE IT MOVE IT*",1
"Looks like the MG car ad dude is a fan of Modi, bringing up an anagram for everything",5
Imagine not bowling your best bowler in the death.,1
Jase is gold,1
Lord. Lord. Lord.,3
"SR of parag vs length balls is 105

Nehra must be salivating at the stat",8
Damn Holder is a big unit.,2
Here comes the Lord,5
My bac,2
"Wow, Holder having a great first game back.",6
"I literally just told my dad, ‚ÄúSteve Smith will get out this over‚Äù",6
You know something is very wrong when you are getting hit for boundaries but r/cricket wants you to shave your neck beard,7
Specialist fielder,3
Holder picked 3 wickets.,3
Legoooo,2
Jason BLM Holder gets the cunt.,3
"Lord Time, Lord Time",4
Smith needs to do some deadlifts or something lol that looked so weak and he looked like he middled it,2
"Yes. Shake your head and walk on Smithy.


Lord Incoming?",3
"This is actually good for RR, two Lords at the crease",4
"When all your overseas player are world Cup winners, 

And u depend on the lord and his disciple

Then u r in rr",4
The lord cometh...,4
RR's two best bstsmen at crease,4
So who should KXIP fans support for this match?,2
Oh no now we have to face Tewatia,5
Send Archer and not Lord,5
Bring in Shankar just so we see Lord vs Lord,4
Smith should stick to shadow batting /s,4
Lord incoming now ffs,4
"Please don't go for Natarajan in 20th lmao, go for 3D",4
"Steve ""shaking my head"" Smith",3
TWATia is in,1
Parag and tewatia PTSD incoming .,1
Tewatia for the kill,2
Oye..so kissing the ball is okay with the COVID protocols?,3
Ash asked Nattu if he should be doing something in addition to yorkers and he said  its what he is good at and will continue to do that. And today we see how much of a problem it is when he is missing yorkers or becoming too predictable.,4
Now big boi holder has to get arrogant tewatia out and I‚Äôm satisfied even if we loose,2
Straight into the hands of SRH's specialist fielder,3
Who ate RR's balls?,2
Lord: Every fucking time...,2
"**18.1** Holder to Smith, OUT, Smith gets no power. He is expecting the yorker, so he goes deep into the crease to turn this full ball into a half-volley, but manages no timing in the slog. Caught at long-on **134-5**

SPD Smith c Pandey b Holder 19 (15b 2x4 0x6) SR: 126.66",0
[deleted],5
Ah shit parag and tewatia again...,2
The Lord hath come,4
Smith looks so ungainly when he slogs. He's not a natural accelerator. Less so compared to Kohli (of course) but I think even Kane is better than him in this respect,0
"There was a time when we used to wonder how to get Smith out, now it's not even a news when he gets out",2
"This the over folks. Holder at death isn't a great record. Tewatia, Parag or Archer should feast to get them to a decent total. Or they fucked for the season.",5
So the two players who fucked SRH last time are back in the middle.,1
"Did he kiss the ball?

Get out the wipes lads",3
I see swanny cheating on his wife with tewatia again huh,16
Lol!! The height difference between Holder and Warner.,7
Parag super underrated,9
"The more overs that go by, the less shit Stokes innings looks. Parag last over aside, it looks hard work.",4
Bah gawd its Tewatia's music,7
"Just realised that ""the length"" is the good length area, not ""full length"" area as what I assumed it to be. Now I'm in total agreement with Nehraji - to bowl at the length at good pace is not a bad idea at all.",1
Swann simps for tewatia just as much as r/cricket smh,1
Does Smith really fits into this side as a batsman?. There are better batsman at the top and with Buttler and Parag in the middle order I don't see him batting there either. He can't come later on since he's not a quick run scorer or a power hitter.,1
Parag may not be as exciting as Padikkal/Gill/Shaw but he is the most confident and has the best temperament among any young Indian batsmen. Redefining the Cool. Sure shot to play for India at some point in coming years.,8
"Smith should open if not Buttler, it is the worst of both world's at the moment",4
Finally grabs.,3
FUCK YES WARNER,4
Holder 4 wickets.,9
The 3 international batsmen have really screwed with RR batting line up. They need a better planning to go into their lineup.,8
Wtf Holder,7
Warner pulled off a Sreesanth!,5
"Holy shit holder, first match and already a 3 for",6
Okay Holder don't you fucking start bowling Yorkers.,5
Oh gawd no,4
Jason Holder is worth his weight in gold!!!,7
we‚Äôre really fucked today huh,3
Holder my Man...,6
"Tbh, would've sent in Archer, he strikes from ball 1. Tewatia takes a little",9
Holder hasn't put a foot wrong today.,10
Is that the... white supremacy sign what Holder did?,2
Waiting for the dance move,7
1 Lord gone!,3
Warner you tit,3
Helll yaaaa tewatia next bois,2
Butler and Smudge have been absolutely useless this tournament.,3
Test bowler with variations > Yorker boy,5
"Bye bye, good catch captain",6
r/nonononoyes,6
I'm sorry lord holder,5
Scenes if Warner does kuchipudi!,5
Every fucking catch is a big suspense this year,4
lmao that catch was a 'yes no no no yes' situation,6
Holder best Death specialist? /s,6
Good bowling by Holder. Is he all of a sudden a good t20 bowler or is this just his night?,6
Lmao Warner made a mess around of that.,1
OMG Tewatia and Archer. No please,2
"**18.2** Holder to Parag, OUT,  **135-6**

R Parag c Warner b Holder 20 (12b 2x4 1x6) SR: 166.66",1
Damn Holder making an impact,6
Letsss gooooo butta bomma,9
"The Lord shaved off his beards, Kohli I hope you know what to do",7
"Warner has such incredibly strong core 
 
someone else falling like that would have hit their head due to backlash",4
Warner missed the perfect opportunity to Bihu dance,3
SRH are gonna gey thrased now üò±,3
time for RRs middle order/depth to show up,3
Lord of the Death has arrived.,4
Time for 6 sixes Archer üò≥,6

Just give strike to the Lord,5
SRH skipper fumbling with the ball... As if it was a bit too smooth... Almost as if it had been.........,5
Bihu dance time bois,6
Holder already has the same number of wickets Cummins has in 10 games this season,12
Holder vs Jofra contest! But it‚Äôs Holder who bowls to Jofra!,5
Lord cometh,1
The ring of fire is shit man. How many catches have been dropped in this ground already?,1
Why does Scottie call siraj shiraz?,3
Finally the two big hitters for rr at the crease,3
Absolute roller-coaster of a catch,2
" Out of the loop , why isn‚Äôt kane Williamson playing?",1
What if stokes and parag switch their positions in the batting lineup?,1
[deleted],0
Tewatia skin tone also became lighter after shaving,1
"There they are, rr only two batsman

Unlike srh they don't open",6
Why is RR batting lineup so agonozingly long?,10
"Warner's facial expressions with that moustache as he was catching that, you could literally hear the charlie chaplin soundtrack",7
"Jof in now. Striking at 160, he will be eyeing the opening position next game so look out.",5
Joffra and Tewatia. It better rain 4s and 6s now. Take out the popcorn bois.,5
English and Australian batsmen are terrible this IPL. They're surviving on reputation alone.,2
"Does Warner wake up in the morning, look at himself in the mirror and think ""Wow I look like Tom Selleck with this moustache.""",6
Another match in which the team left too much for death overs.,1
"If Stokes, Smith, Buttler all struggled to score freely you have to assume this is a difficult pitch, but watch SRH chase it in 12 overs.",1
Feel bad for Kanos man but I feel Holder is better for SRH as far as team combination is concerned. More so since Bhuvi is also injured,1
So who does Holder replace when Kanos returns?,2
[deleted],-2
Warner looked like Bubbles in that slow-mo,-1
"Tewatia and Archer both at the crease, 175 total incoming ez",1
Archer is RR's actual finisher.,1
Get tewatia out and I will support your spot in the team for the rest of the season pls holder,10
[deleted],-1
How did they not get 2 there?,1
imma judge nattu by the way he gonna bowl the last over to jofra,0
Get ready This is gonna be hell of a ride!!,0
Priyam Garg has such a nice smile,6
No worries 3D. You bowled good today.,4
SRH should get Parag in next auction.,5
Shankar for the last over please.,1
Why is archer wearing a watch,1
VJ and Tewatia shaved together,14
How did Vijay Shankar manage to start looking like Priyam Garg,8
"There's something in this ground which make it difficult to catch.

Good fielders are finding it hard to keep the ball in hands properly.",1
"Lord stealing 2s

Oh Warner's mad üòÅ,1
Somehow got 2 there lol,2
"Beating 3 great teams in a row is not going to happen too many times which is flaw with the current playoff format. So, I always consider it top 2 or bust.",3
"Why did Tewatia shave??
His beard was Badass!!!",5
Good over from holder,6
Holder‚Äôs fucked us.. gg,3
"Pls guys, just close it clean. Pls don‚Äôt do anything stupid.",3
Jofra trying to smack every ball to oblivion,1
"welcome to the Rajasthan Royals bottle shop, what would you like bottled today?",1
Very good spell from Holder.,2
Unrelated but goatee is back? I mean I see lot of these cricketers trying it out,3
How tf did they manage to get 2 runs from that,1
Swanny gonna cry now,11
Holder u beauty üëè,1
What is Archer always grumpy about? Noticed this while he fields as well.,0
Warner looks like a responsible Indian dad with that moustache,15
Vijay Shankar maybe..,1
Predictable bowler,-1
"Ok, someone must have wasted enough balls to make everyone mindlessly slog now. Who is the culprit?",1
Jofra pyrotechnics are the best,3
Please Just finish it with less than 10 runs.,1
Haha yes Jofra,2
"Swann and Tewatia, still a better love story than Twilight",7
"Not gonna be an easy chase if they get to 150. 

Pitch looks dangerous.",2
STOP WITH THE YORKERS YOU STUPID CUNT,1
my whole neighbourhood probably just heard me going ‚ÄúOH JOFRA! JOFRAAAA‚Äù,3
Nattu being too predictable there,-1
Nattu man please,4
Lmao predictable bowler.,1
The watch is helping his timing,8
Its happening!!!!,3
Haha Nattu cmon,0
Nattu is a cunt. RR sure look prepared for this YoRkeR specialist.,4
He's one of the meanest fast bowlers on the planet and he's playing shots like that.,7
Why is natrajan laughing after bowling the same delivery all time???,5
Jofra already striking quicker than Stokes.,3
P. Natrajan (Left arm fast Yorker/Full tosser),6
"Poor Jofra, just can't stop sighing at every ball",1
Nattu is the only bowler who is reason for this high score.,0
Jeez. Batsmen are now prepared fully to face an yorker. Nattu needs to work on his variations,1
Yo Archer a proper rounder executing picture perfect scoops and shit,4
Archer read him like a book.,5
"If lord doesn't hit one six also, I'll be disappointed",1
That was good from Bairstow to stop that going for 4,5
The hell was that,0
What was that wide,2
Hahahaha cheeky shot from Jof,2
"Jofra Archer‚Äôs watch is helping him with his timing 

~ Rohan Gavaskar, 2020",66
Wide wow,2
Wtf are u smiling at ?,0
Never thought we would have to ask the bowler to stop bowling yorkers,4
Just close it clean.,2
Natrajan - zindagi m aage badhne k liye use great learning,1
Why is Jofra never this good with the Bat in an england shirt,8
Archer has such a nice stance tbh.,3
lol archer better than the lot of them,1
Balls that wide should give 2 runs,2
"Just subscribed to dugout, let's see what's the hype is all about.",3
Need 4 sixes tewatia,1
"I'm really curious, how much are the IPL commentators paid?",8
Oh lawd he on strike,3
"I did not even know SRH had Holder, maybe they forgot too.",2
"The match has gone very much along expected lines till now. If nothing changes, I would say it is advantage SRH at this point.",6
Problem with Nattu is if his yorkers are not coming off he doesn't know anything else.,4
"With the pitches getting slower, 140-150 actually seems like a reasonable first innings score.",7
Atleast put 2 guys behind the batsman if you're going to bowl the fucking yorker wtf,2
And that's why bowling 6 yorkers on a trot is difficult as hell,5
Johnny did well to keep that.,4
Stokes and Buttler less than 100 SR lmao,0
Swanny‚Äôs gonna start a YouTube channel! Looking forward to it! (If he does decide to go through with it),6
Doesn't that beard itch Nattu?,4
Why are they playing Nadeem if they are going to be give him only one over? He is the Chris Martin of batting in IPL,6
So is Natarajan a yorkerer,6
Wtf natarajan,3
160 coming,3
SRH missing Bhuvi in the death overs?,4
"Pandey's KRAs in the team -

- Fielding

- Batting

- Explaining Warner's suggestions to Nattu",48
Was Mumbai Indians comeback that 1 year the best one ever in ipl ?,6
Where has holder been all tournament for srh!? They desperately needed an attacking fast bowler,1
"r/cricket: Natu is a hella good

When Natu has 1 bad day

r/cricket: Natu can‚Äôt bowl",75
Nattu's neckbeard is like one of the Indian uncles with their masks pulled down.,8
My boy Bumer is not even in top 5 in the yorkers list. Boult is.,5
You want to know what's going to be the next delivery?,1
"Every match it's the same thing, we bowl well all the way until death and give it away. Takes one bowler only whether it's Sandeep Kaul thampi or natarajan",5
42 yorkers from Nattu lol,6
"If Nattu gets a better bowling coach, i think he would be one of the best bowler for SRH. I say invest in coaching staff along with investing in players. We can clearly see the difference coaching and support staff made in RCB and DC teams.",7
So... clean shaven Lord doesn't work.,10
Wow udana. But still his economy > 10,1
guess Tewatia‚Äôs no match for Natarajan,5
"Ngl, natarajan's beard looks horrible",10
[deleted],-5
Natrajan's facial hair is ü§Æ,8
lord needs some time to get going,2
Shouldve given it to Shankar,-1
"It is clear players are finding it difficult to get away slower balls, shouldn't Natarajan try that? It is easier to execute than Yorkers.",4
[David Warner (file picture)](https://i.imgur.com/qMSgXIl.jpg),3
"Absolute trash unhittable ball, somehow a dot. Make T20's batsman friendly ffs. Sincerely, a bowler.",7
"RR struck gold with Jofra. 

Also, does anyone remember that Cooper guy? Medium pacer played for RR a while ago and was getting wanked off by commentators cuz he was from the Caribbean? Haven‚Äôt seen him in forever.",18
"I think there is a silent rule in SRH about atleast one bowler going for 40+. Have to pay respect to Thampi, Kaul and Khaleel",18
"Jofra feeling bad about shot not going through makes me feel for him, the guy really cares about the game.",11
Natraj went for 11.5rpo,2
They don't have enough do they.... Man Archer running through that top.order and getting into that brittle middle.order of SRH the only way here,0
This I WILL TRY YORKERING EVERYTHING attitude deserved this.,12
[removed],2
I think I saw Tom Curran saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a good score‚Äù or sumn lol,4
Wish India had a pinch hitting bowler like Jofra.,7
Archer and Tewatia the only one consistently contributing with both Bat and Ball. Never thought I would see the day,4
wtf nattu has forty fucking three yorkers to his name,2
Nattu‚Äôs spell was much better than his figures suggest,6
SRH can't chase. More so when the target is over 150.,5
"""Nattu kelandruchi pa"". 

Translation: Nattu is Bolt in Tamil, Bolt dismantled.",3
Lord gonna take a 5ifer cuz he didn't get to bat,0
Do the SRH players have some sort of inside-joke ‚Äòwho can grow the dodgiest facial hair‚Äô challenge going on..?,9
What can possibly make someone with that beard go on national TV. Is this a prank?,4
[deleted],-4
We might not have good batsman but we bat deep. One of them is bound to click. Warner or Bairstow have to go aggressive at the start,6
Another gem of an innings by Archer.,4
"Unpopular opinion: they take too long to bowl. Changing fields after every delivery, chatting in the middle. There have to be rules against it

T20 shouldn't take 4 hours",7
47 runs in the last 27 balls. This is going to kill us again today.,7
10-15 runs under par but defendable against SRH,3
Wtf why isn't Lord unadkat playing,6
"Yeah, we're not chasing that down.",9
Jof to go take a 5er off the first over now,2
Open with Jofra and put Stokes at 6,3
Slightly below par but really not by much.,1
Will jof get another xbox for a warner wicket?,3
My man archer cares more abt his batting than bowling lol,1
Is 155 decent target?,3
Everyone except the recognised batsmen in RR is looking more comfortable with the bat.,3
[deleted],1
That's 3 games in a row with over 40 runs for Nattu.,7
Easy for srh unless they have a brain fade,7
Rajasthan are at least twenty runs short. At least.,5
Only Jof deserves to be retained,5
[deleted],4
Needed another 10-20 runs to win I think.,4
How has Vijay Shankar been bowling this well this season?,5
I think Jofra has just swung the match for RR.,4
Was Khaleel just dropped or is he injured?,2
And just like every match 1 bowler undoes all the work,3
Natarajan looks he'd be a legit test bowler.,2
Was the pitch bad or we just fucked up?,8
When u realise that 3D have same economy as Rashid in last two games he played,16
"Weird not to see boom in the Yorker list, then realised his stock delivery has been *unplayable* fulltoss",12
Jofra had Warner on toast in the summer so wonder how this is gonna go,3
"Go SRH, chase it down.

Full support from KKR & KKR fans.",24
I'll take it. 50/50 right now. Need to play out jofra archer and we'll win,11
"I just realized that SRH's next 4 games are against: MI, DC, RCB, and KXIP. Those are the best 4 teams in the competition right now, going by recent form.

So, if SRH can't chase 155 today, god help them in the next matches.",18
"Joffradamus needs more Batting time, he's in some smoking touch, another cameo at 200+ SR.",3
"What do you say when Jason Holder is bowling and he just missed the stumps?


AdJasont Holder",8
Buttler or Smith? Who would RR retain with Jofra?,2
archers gone cuckoo,2
"Can someone explain the logic of Smith asking bhenchod to open instead Of Butler? 

He's trying way too hard to optimize the opening, like just let your openers open dude.  You bought them because they do great as openers!!!",6
I think suoer overrrrrr,5
Bottom dweller problems- batting team thinks they scored less and bowling team thinks they gave away more runs,10
"Srh should chase this down as long as either Warner or bairstow has a reasonable knock, the middle order should carry it through",3
Tom Curran was doing better than Stokes tbh,6
"catch pakde shahbaaz ne bangaye shah baaz 

wtf is he saying",9
Match ka mujrim : Stokes,6
I have a feeling that Holder was disappointed on not being asked any question regarding BLM.,10
Surprised to see Bumrah not even in the top 5 for Yorkers bowled. What's up with him?,11
Tewatia has done pretty great this year but his attitude is making me not like him.,7
"If rr loses, you know is to be blamed?that mcdonalds guy and the owner.",5
"Stop crying srh fans, you are easily chasing the total down.",8
How much was Rashid bought for?,2
"Division of SRH bowlers:

A. Main bowlers:

Rashid khan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar


B. Good enough bowlers:

Holder, Sandeep, Nadeem 


C. Part timers:

Samad, Shankar


D. For-Entertainment-Purposes:

Khaleel, thampi, Natarajan",8
"Klusener way of batting.

In those days when reverse swing was prominent and people got Yorkers right more often than not, Klusener said, his plan was simple: You can't get all 6 Yorkers right, bowlers will miss 2 and I will hammer them to boundaries.

So, for all the Yorker talks, Natarajan has got most of them right but still has very high economy in this IPL season cause of that.",6
I am still nervous with that score.,10
Team budgets for the auction must be inversely proportional to where they finish in the table to bring everyone at par! That will also give us a lot of teams throwing away games to be last which should be fun lol.,-4
"Natrajan bowled well. He knows his strength and he has the backing of his captain who tells him to focus on his strengths. He's been mint all tourney and one off day doesn't change it. 

You also have to realise once Bhuvi was ruled out, he's been their lone death overs banker. 

Most other franchises hunt in pairs -- Rabada & Nortje, Bumrah & Boult etc

He has to shoulder all the pressure and burden and has done fantastically well. I hope he doesn't change anything.",18
ITT: both sets of fans thinking they've already lost,14
">opening up the tournament further more and making it more competitive

Which team should win today?",3
With SRH you are never 15 runs short. It‚Äôs called being on ‚Äúpar‚Äù,17
Why did jaiswal flop though?,1
SRH fans are annoying,-6
"If Jadhav hadn‚Äôt royally fucked up against KKR, they‚Äôd be 8th",3
todays game brought to you by Spirit of CSK^^TM,3
I know it‚Äôs whataboutery but what score would RR have ended up on Uthappa didn‚Äôt attempt that ridiculous run,6
One thing that‚Äôs become clear in this IPL is that Warner and Bairstow struggle to hit in the middle overs if they get a slow start. I reckon we will know the result of this game right after the powerplay.,5
Only Sanjay Bangar calls him Steven Smith.,9
Congrats srh on winning,6
Sucks for miller and TC. Miller specially because he is a proper middle order batsman and he can't get a match because of big name benstokes. They even accomodated benstokes batting position just to play him. RR deserves to not make it in playoffs.,5
"Sad for Jofra man, dude gotta bowl in powerplay and  death overs + handle finishing job too...",9
"Unless there is a collapse, SRH will be winning this quite easily.",3
SRH has a very tough schedule after this match.,9
Stokes showed why he is the MVP... in tests,6
"Lmao *absolute cracker* dial it down a bit, we will see it dw",2
"Commentators calling MI vs CSK tomorrow a huge interesting clash. Lol!!

They have to stick to their script..!",15
"Tonight, CSK aren't even playing; but the Hindi Commentators are continuing the Dhoni-Chants. It has become so annoying.",12
"Fun fact: Kamran Akmal, Younis Khan, Darren Lehmann and Justin Langer - all have 1 more IPL trophy than Kohli, de Villiers and Gayle combined.",13
First 2 overs of Jofra are gonna be most important. Let's see how it goes.,7
Warner c Samson b Archer 0(1),3
SRH tail begins at one down.,9
Stokes out Miller in.,8
yo we are gonna lose this,6
Out of the 5 teams only Punjab deserves to be in playoffs.,3
Daily Reminder- Jof and Buttler are stuck with RR till death,2
"RR next game is against us, I hope they don't make Buttler open again for that match",3
Archer warner battle predictions?,2
In all honesty Kxip deserves #4 over RR,4
"I think Rajasthan just promoted Stokes to open because he shat the bed so much in the last two seasons in the middle-order. 

His last 12 scores at 4 and 5 in IPL:

11, 8, 0, 7*, 1*, 16*, 6, 11, 14, 12, 1 and 0

Honestly if he's gonna bowl like garbage, they'd be better off dropping him, opening with Sanju and playing either Miller or an extra overseas fast bowler. 

Stokes' situation is different from Maxwell because while Maxwell has been giving 4 overs and has been only failing in a firing batting unit, Stokes has hardly bowled and has almost always hindered the team with his batting upfront. They have a real good chance of making the top 4, need to be ruthless.",10
The next hour of play is going to be crucial.,4
Archer is the best finished ever. He hit the last ball six /s,1
"Okay here's a call: SRH wins from performance of an Indian batsman

(I fucking hope)",10
[deleted],7
Sanju Samson has got wonderful hands,2
"Oh god what have we done. Stokes looked completely out of touch and soaked up a whole load of balls but yet didn't kick on. Samson was decent but also couldn't kick on...actually that's the story of our batting today. We actually made Vijay Shankar look like a good bowler.

Watch them knock this off in 16 overs",4
SRH have the worst fans ( so pessimistic ),5
"If srh gets 100 in 12 overs, we are dead",3
"SRH's disadvantage is RR is not playing Unadkat today, so they got to offset that.",8
Our entire batting lineup at the crease,10
why does smith look like a child whose kurkere has been snatched because he has a prostrate test tomorrow,2
"Lmao, we did not win a single match this season, chasing..",6
"If Jonny doesnt get cleaned up by Joffra, this match is ending fast.",3
Swann taking on trolls. Lol.,4
Warner and his tik toks getting roasted lmaooo,3
"come on jof, get warner in the first over",2
Dugout commentators talking about Warner‚Äôs TikToks lol,4
"Well hoping that jofra would fuck over warner again lol, I am disappointed not seeing the lord",1
LOL Warner's TikToks WERE cringeworthy and terrible at last someone said it on comms!,2
Some Aussie English dual citizen guy has part stakes in RR right ?,2
"Though SRH has the best NRR among the bottom 5 teams, their next matches are against MI, DD, RCB and a rejuvenated KXIP.",3
"Tomorrow's MI v CSK 

Sutron ke anusaar, pitch will start deteriorating on the 2nd half of Day3 itself!",4
"Here is 10 dollars and 80 grams of cocaine

Good thing about the game is both captains can share sandpaper,6

Is this the Ashes?,4
lol I was just going to comment that Bairstow should have taken the strike against Archer,1
We have entered test match mode.,4
Epic,2
Why take strike if you are a bunny to a bowler? Just let Bairstow take the strike ffs,5

You ever reach a point where you are more curious who ‚ÄòShallu‚Äô is in the PhonePe add over the match?,5
Warner vs Jofra and Broad > Warne vs Cullinan,3
There was an SRH fan who kept saying how SRH needs to move on from Davey. I agree with you mate. Warner has done his part for the team. We both need to move on now,1
Specialist fielder Stokes,8
David ‚ÄúI forgot how to bat‚Äù Warner,5
For Warner to go out with a c Stokes b Archer combo definitely gives me a semi.,30
Yeah playoffs are done,9
Good on smudge to have 2 slips esp after a boundary .,5
Stokes and catches is a treat!,3
"It's absolutely unacceptable for Robin Uthappa to ""drop"" a chance that didn't even exist in the first place and Rahul ""can do no wrong"" Tewatia will scream at him but of course when he himself fails to grab onto Warner off Jofra he'll just grin like nobody was the wiser",6
There‚Äôs bad chemistry between Smith and England All Stars IMO. It‚Äôs kinda weird,4
5D chess move by Warner: Don't need to worry about runs or orange caps if your entire team is already wearing orange caps...,4
"two english players combining to get rid of warner, you love to see it",6
Good cricket by RR. Genuine dismissal,2

KKR fans wondering what is this witchcraft of having two slips and actually bowling your fastest and most in form bowler immediately.,27
Warner c Stokes b Archer is a nice way to start my evening,8
"stokes made that catch look easy, moved early, kept his hands together",9
Every time I finish work and look at an RR scorecard and see they've opened with stokes again I get more and more confused. Just stupid really.,7
"CSK has the chance to play all the youngsters tomorrow since they're out of the tournament, don't come complaining spark nahi hai yeh nahi hai wo nahi hai loda lassan.",7
"I am not really fond of the English cricket team, but I always find myself rooting for Bairstow whenever he plays, partly  because he is such a weird unit, but mostly because I have a very similar technique as a batsman - getting bowled right through the gate.",7
Bringing in Rajpoot to kill the momentum that Jofra generated.,10
It is painful to be an SRH fan,11
Trying to imagine how awkward the planning for the Warner wicket would have been in RR dressing room.,7
Lord Tewatia went from looking like a badass Haryanvi truck driver to an awkward sales rep for a bad SIM carrier with a single shave.,32
Okay how did this team defeat us,1
üèπ‚Äôs üê∞,10
"No Scotty, Smith doesn't need to expose the secret to Archer about Warner's weakness. Every Englishman and their Grandma know about it.",15
Ideally Bairstow should've taken the strike but Warner ego won't allow that to happen,7
"what a shot, too hard to execute",1
Love how these Aussies forget footwork in the beginning of innings.,2
All those length balls by Archer. Ashish Nehra admitted to the ER for massive rush of blood to groin,6
SRH management needs to go back to drawing board and question all their assumptions and perceptions. Once again bring in better support staff and build the team from scratch. Us fans won't mind if we are in 8th position this season if it forces the management to do this,3
Arey Pandey oka winning innings adu ra babu,1

What the hell is going on to our batsmen. Even out best are not in form.,5
why isnt uthappa keeping?,3
"69 meter six

*Nice*",3
yo wtf a google search is showing anushka sharma as rashids wife,5
It's crazy that Archer has made one of the most devastating openers from Australia a bunny for him this year.,1
Is it me or Smith as a captain does not look comfortable with this RR side. I remember him as captain in 2015 and 2017 RPS. Those sides look.....more harmonious?,3
Rajasthan is out if they lose this match?,3
"I am scared that our Bois may not reach 49, ngl",9
Won't be surprised if RR kneejerks to bring back unadkat again next match.,4
Rajpoot is in RR as catchment area quota,2
Bairstow plz take your time don't hurry we really need you,2
Rajpoot get this Bairstow bloke out,3
Swanny fapping over lord's sunhat,4
Parag looking better and better as he gets more experience. Might be a Suryakumar Yadav type player,21
Rajpoot is going to win it for SRH.  If you observe carefully you can see the 'bali ka bakra' costume on him.,4
[deleted],4
People that are suggesting to drop Warner are the most idiotic people ever.,7
This is a below par total right?,2
"What the fuck happened to Ankit Rajpoot? He was bowling 135 with movement consistently, not so long ago. Now he looks like he's no better than Vijay Shankar with the ball. 

(No disrespect to 3D, IK he's been great for two games now).",2
Where's Buttler? Last match also Samson was keeping,2
This is an easy chase if Pandey or Baristow bats through,3
Rr please please win and keep the tournament alive and make it interesting .,1
"Without kanos, srh has their only batsman at crease",2
If every batsman makes 15(10) SRH will win,7
"Can't wait for Vijay Shankar's 11(15), shaking his head and looking at the skies on his way back to the dressing room",6
"Once Warner becomes your bunny, he'll forever be your bunny. So loyal.",7
[deleted],1
Yeah Pandey just pile up pressure on Bairstow by eating all the deliveries.,1
Come on Archer get Pandey,2
They should really cover the stadiums in solar panels so that it can act as a power plant during the day ...,3
Archer after Rajpoot over- Mehnat barbaad behenchod,7
Nothing serious just mirzapur 2 is out on prime video 4 hrs before it's release,7
Archer is just so good,3
same as Pandey against CSK chance,2
Robbie's brilliant fielding continues,3
Strange throw,1
Why is Kane not playing today?,3
Manish pandey trying his best to get off strike lmao,3
"Bairstow my boy....not today, not today",4
that should be run out,3
"my dad facepalmed at uthappa‚Äôs throw, I can‚Äôt stop laughing rn",11
Robbie just looks like he is dragging along to get a paycheck .,6
Uthappa is just good at getting run out himself,5
"We have rcb searching for a keeper, rr has 3 on the field",9
Fuck :(,10
Holy fuck.,3
Archer absolute fire,7
Classic Bairstow dismissal,13
There goes ur batting srh,10
Utterly clueless.,6
Omg,5
Gg Bois,7
Good night,5
What a ball. Fuck,7
THIS MAN IS ON FIRE,9
Fuck,3
Damn that was amazing,7
Damn SRH is done,6
See you boys next year,2
JB just can't play inswingers lol,4
"Damn, what a ball",2
"LMAO, CSK make way for SRH.",7
Absolutely peach,3
There goes our batting,4
"I think once Kane is fit, we‚Äôd likely drop Johnny and continue with Holder.",9
Beauty,3
CASTLED,5
"SRH derives their energy from Warner and despite being in top 5 for Orange cap, he has been really off color this season. He has the second lowest SR among the top 10 batsman in the race.",7
Kill me,6
GG for SRH this season,2
Jof and Tewatia will singlehandedly drag RR to playoffs won't they,15
Fucking hell,4
Show the speed you cowards.,5
Joffra deserves a better batting line up.,5
Jofra is a fking beast,5
That's a bad man,3
I have seen something like this before actually I have seen this many times Jhonny,2
Keep Archer in the attack. Try to get the 3rd wicket.,5
Match over,1
Rajpoot plays as a specialist bowler ffs,4
Lol who saw that coming?,2
"Give Archer a 3rd over Smithy, please.",5
jonny 'through the gate' bairstow,6
Fs for SRH,3
"**2.4** Archer to Bairstow, OUT, Can he ever? A 149kmph length ball seaming in to take the top of middle. As good as his ball to Shaw earlier in the season **16-2**

JM Bairstow  b Archer 10 (7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 142.85",2
"SRH in trouble now, no Williamson",2
Peak Jofra. Man it's a treat to watch!,5
Don't worry too much Jonny that was a JAFFER,5
Holy shit! What a ball,3
Peak Bairstow,2
OK. TATA. BYE BYE.,2
Fucking peach!,3
Bairstow bowled by one that nips in...never seen that before,5
"Jofra single-handedly winning another match, I'm shocked",2
"Bairstow and getting bowled, name a better combo",1
Maku kuda assam ticket ready cheyandi,3
Wake me up when Sunrisers win,1
Bad shot. Just defend. Why the flourish?,1
Manish Pandey will win it for SRH,1
Hit sixes all you want but no sight is better than a fast bowler taking the stumps for a walk,3
"This fucking guy man

King Jof",7
"Best bowlers in the world currently? Archer, Rabada, Bumrah, Amir, Cummins, Shami, Rashid, Chahal, am I missing anyone?

EDIT: Boult, starc, Lockie",3
JOF THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL,2
idk whether to laugh or cry,2
"On a length, nipping back and Jonny Bairstow getting bowled, it‚Äôs a tale as old as time...well as old as 2016.",1
That Bairstow gate was open,2
GAME,1
Jofra is God,2
Jof providing some quality banter for when they're back in the England camp üòÇ,4
Archer is better than Rabada imo just because of he is so much more effective in the power play. Has basically won them the match in the first 3 overs.,9
Classic YJB dismissal,2
Completely outclassed by Archer,1
Absolute shit management. They want to chase after lost 3 games chasing and now winning one till now. Some confidence you need to take that shite decision. Gambling in a must win game.,2
Not knee-jerk but we should seriously consider getting Nabi /Kane and drop bairstow. He has been really hit and miss,6
"Fuck this shit, I can't take it just can't. I'll check in by end of the innings and see how we are doing and decide to watch or not. I don't want to be all pissed off tomorrow.",4
"Warner edged and gone: check 

Bairstow bowled through the gate: check",5
YJB batting inswingers: **We dont do that here.** ‚úã‚úã,3
Classic Test Jonny that,4
Ok bye! GG RR. Still don‚Äôt like Parag tho.,3
thats game,2
Archer has been player of the season for me,6
People complaining  about Ben‚Äôs innings as an opener . Yet he still got more runs than both SRH openers combined.,6
Joff-Ra!!,2
Tail is here,1
3D Shankar walking in 2 down . Just as he was supposed to in wc2019,3
Top quality stuff from Archer. /r/deathrattleporn worthy!,6
Nothing better then watching a pacer cleaning the openers in first few overs.,7
They really brought Shankar early lmao,1
"Well if there is any opportunity, it is now for Shankar and manish to perform",3
Jof tha man... pandey key though,0
It would be more concerning if his heart wasn't pumping Mark. You pleb,1
Lord you and Lord 3d out,1
Archer should bowl 3rd over too,1
"Smh, come on Sunrisers at least make it competitive and not make Rajestan recover their NRR. Speaking as a Kings XI fan",3
Only srh can choke in run chases like this fuck this team,4
Expecting a classy 50+ from 3D player and an apology thread followed by that,4
Would you bring Joffra for 3rd over?,6
"Is it just my imagination but has Archer just ""turned ON"" something in the IPL that he just didn't during the English summer?  Or is it that the conditions (team, venues) just suit him?",5
"lol SRH fans were talking about how even 150 is a great score and here I was thinking what the hell they are talking about, now it kinda makes sense why they are reverse jinxers",1
Lord yoyo and Lord 3d are going to win it for us,3
Been saying this but Bairstow is a hit or miss guy!,4
Every time I watch Jofra Archer I am more and more convinced he's the closest we'd get to a modern Michael holding.,13
Quick how do I make 3-D glasses at home?,3
Can we let Jofra play tests in pink?,3
Srh done for the day,3
Bairstow gap is inspired by the veteran prostitute of Birmingham brothel,4
Jofra Archer single-handedly defending this score,7
Just rename the franchise to Jofra Archer at this point it's a one man team,8
If we lose now we don't deserve to qualify.,2
feel shankar will do well today at the top of the order,2
YJB departs after a quick fire (142 SR) innings >!of 10(7)!<.,3
How about giving Archer another in the powerplay to go in for the kill,4
Gotta question your batting when you've got Vijay Shankar coming in at 4.,1
"This is so good to watch, watching Jofra knocking out Bairstow and Warner. So much better than watching ABD dismantle B grade bowlers like unadkat.",8
"Good captaincy from Smith, 2 slips and a short leg",2
"Literally a Test field setup in Cred Powerplay, Peak IPL",2
Name a better love story than Bairstow and getting bowled,2
Warner is playing with a strike rate of 120 as an opener this season.,2
"I'm surprised the win % is 25 without kanos, I thought it'll be 5-10",2
Yeah...I now understand why KKR is 4th.,2
Hope archer gets his third now,1
Bairstow with some more content for r/deathrattleporn,2
Watching SRH just ruins my day.,4
SRH's tail starts now,3
"With this form, you can just pull Warner or bairstow off and make Kane the captain again lmao",5
Ffs Not another over from Rajpoot,2
Jofra Archer if you read this im free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. Please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I‚Äôm free.,7
"YJB bowled through the gate? 

Imagine my shock",5
India's WC No. 4 back in his usual spot.,4
"Each time I talk about replacing Bairstow, I get geniuses rushing to me and asking who‚Äôll keep? Like WTF, did you really think we have only 1 keeper ?",3
Archer again carrying rajasthan on his back.,4
Good game boys. SRH competing with CSK for bottom of the table.,2
Just think he almost wasn‚Äôt in England‚Äôs 2019 WC squad,2
Jofra ‚Äúcall me daddy‚Äù Archer,3
"Hyd folks, do we still have hope without Kanos here?",0
"Archer after getting all the post match awards,

*Sonar bhai, 10 tola aur daal do*

T: He's gonna get a bigger gold chain",8
They should let Archer come back for the 3rd and end this.,5
GoodBye SRH,3
It feels like Jof has been 2/5 from his first spell basically every game lately. He is absurdly good.,3
"Why not RR start opening with Archer, just like Narine did for KKR?",2
r/DeathrattlePorn,2
"Time to drop Bairstow, Kane is a more capable batsman and we can bring in Nabi and boost the lower order.",1
We are officially competing to replace CSK.,3
Tyagi is your second best fast bowler? Why won't you give your second over to him?,1
Nortje seeing that list- And I took that personally,2
"Back on line Tyagi, come on",2
"Most teams have a cheat code bowler who rarely get hit 
Rr- archer
Dc-rabada
Mi- bumrah
Srh -rashid khan
Rcb- sundar /chahal",5
[deleted],2
SRH's last batting pair gone with just 16 runs on the board,2
[deleted],12
No disrespect to Tyagi but let's see if Tyagi gets his lucky wicket today. He has usually got one every match except vs CSK,2
Bairstow made 85 runs from 78 bowls in the last 4 games.,4
[deleted],7
That sound off the bat,3
I‚Äôm tempted to buy SRH team tickets to Hyderabad.,3
3D in at #4,2
Who are the people that are allowed into the stadium to watch? Family?,6
Useful information: India started the WC with KL as the #4 and it was only after Dhawan got injured that KL was moved to open.,5
Jason Holder is going to single handedly win this and become the Dream 11 Game Changer of the Match,7
Tyagi kitna liya be? ü§®,4
Pandey has a weirdly good record against only MI and RR lol,4
Is any other team as dependent on one man than we are on Archer?,7
"Imagine RR had even a half decent Indian quick to back up Jof. Saying that, imagine even one of the other overseas had even been half as good as Jof too in this tournament",2
Guff bowling at the other end,1
"Commentators have been fapping about Rabada a lot this IPL but a lot of his wickets have come late in the game and have been tail enders. He's been great, but not as you'd think given his stats.

Joff been the best fast bowler this Ipl me thinks.",22
"Imagine RR had even a half decent Indian quick to back up Jof. Saying that, imagine even one of the other overseas had even been half as good as Jof too in this tournament

edit: I do think Tyagi looks pretty good, but would be better for him if he was 3rd seamer with the option to only bowl a couple of overs if it's not going right.",5
Jeez man how disheartening this must be for archer,4
Guruvar to Pandey ji ka hota hai.,2
Tyagi undoing all of Archers good work,3
I wish we could just clone Jofra and make some indian versions of him,4
Mods better change Rajasthan Royals fair to Jofra Archer,9
"Perhaps they could get Stokes on for an over, and one over of spin.",3
filth from tyagi. 90s indian bowler drivel,0
"Tyagi is doing tyag(sacrifice , donation)",1
"Karthik: *On a good day bowler should bowl upto 5 or 6 overs.*

What?",23
"Though Rabada has more wickets, I would say Archer is the best bowler of the tournament so far. And if you add the batting too, Archer easily wins.",18
"I really thought Hyd will end up at 7th, team‚Äôs crushing my hopes",2
idk why RR intentionally fuck with their batting order. Why can't they go with what has worked in the past i.e Butler at top? It's not like they're in position to experiment ffs,7
Hot take. We should've sent in Rashid so he could try scoring a quick 30(15) to reduce pressure,7
Stop bowling short and wide ffs,4
What happened to young lad today?,3
RR have one reliable bowler,2
Some commentators can't even count,2
Idk why but Smith's face always looks a mix of happy and sad,2
Sweet revenge would be to let lower order take SRH through like how RR did the previous time round,2
Pandey is as good a white ball batsman as Bairstow wtf is Swann going on about?!,-1
Wtf was that over from Tyagi? I thought he was RR's second best bowler.,4
"if the other rr bowlers were good, they would actually be the best team in the league, jfc",2
"How Manish Pandey constructs his innings?

4 boundaries. 11 dots.

16(15). Strike rate - just over 100",1
"Jofra Archer be like,

'Man this is rough, I'm bowling my heart out and there's absolutely no support at all. 

90s Sachin: First time‚ÄΩ",30
Other bowlers undoing whatever Archer has done so far.,7
The best all rounder in the world vs stokes,5
"‚ÄúSRH can‚Äôt drop Bairstow because you have like two batsmen!‚Äù

85 runs from 77 balls in the last 4 games. Where was Bairstow the batsmen? Still stuck in the KXIP game when the opponent was at its lowest point?",4
The way Archer is bowling puts into perspective how incredible SKY‚Äôs scoops and ramps were in the MI game. Played him fearlessly despite getting hit on the head.,4
Best all-rounder vs ben stokes,6
Wish Sunrisers kept bidding for a Archer in that 2018 auction. Bhuvi/Archer/Rashid attack would‚Äôve been so effective.,5
Archer did it for XBox,5
"RR playing without Unadkat, that's illegal",1
No Joffra! Thanks Smudge.,5
Tyagi doesn't want that emerging player award I guess with all the wides he's bowling,0
"Ball after ball of utter filth from Tyagi. All he had to do was bowl straight and build on what Archer had done but he blew it.   
You're barely 140+. Not even regularly 145+. More of this misdirected drivel and you'll suffer the ignominy of being replaced by Unadkat",2
Warner is scared of the ball LOL,2
Pandey..... Dude uncool,2
Swann is an idiot... Pandey probably has a better IPL record than Bairstow does.. quite insulting of him,6
Looks like Jofra has to do it all today,7
Ok can someone tell me why Manish Pandey is not doing tuk tuk,7
Archer is single handedly keeping this out of sorts RR side in the competition. He has been thoroughly consistent this season.,11
Benstocks bowls absolute pies.,-1
Tuk tuk k marna tha Kut Kut k nahi,0
Sanga should teach a class on batting.,2
Manish Pandey feeling slutty today,10
Stokes maybe you could‚Äôve played such strokes yourself,0
"Don't do that, don't give me hope",8
Just joining in guys why the hell RR can't play as butler as opener and Stokes as middle order batsmen.,2
This specialist fielder can bat I'll give him that,9
Impossible,0
Srh are finished,-3
Has Manish Pandey ever score a match winning  innings for us?  I don't think so.,-3
Ya Manish Pandey going to play a match winning innings after the tournament is done for srh.,1
Lmao Smith bent back and said DAAAAAAAMN,4
Pandey ji is winning this. Fuck it.,7
WTF Pandey Ji?!,1
Yeah. This is essentially a 16 over game now.,-1
Stokes is economical when batting and run machine when bowling,13
Pandey took offence to all tuk tuk jokes,6
Lol what happened to Pandey today,0
Different strokes for same stokes,4

Manish Pandey: Not Today",3
Stokes just loves getting hit for 6 eh,3
"Why is IPL plagiarizing Hillary Clinton's campaign slogan of ""Stronger Together""",2
Good ass whooping by Manish.,5
3D looks at least 5 years younger.,3
Looks like Tyagi's cocaine stash got over mid series,6
Smudge is a shit captian too.,3
Is this the same ump who had reversed his decision after Dhoni yelled at him?,1
All three bowlers have bowled horribly for RR. Joffra is the only stand out.,6
Bruh Jofra has been the best player this tournament. Bowling like a beast and has been handy with the bat as well . MVP for me.,6
"I wonder what wrong did Varun Aaron do? Got one game, that too at Sharjah, did reasonably well and even created a chance upfront. Raw pace is working like a charm, why not use him?",5
We all talk about SRH having only 2 batsmen today but RR has only 1 bowler tho.,13
Jadeja in that SR list                                                                               CSK Batsmen- Yeh konsi line mein aagaye hai aap?,10
The only thing Shankar doesn't need to do is put pressure on Pandey by scoring slowly.,4
Sanjay b is like the introvert who gets adopted by the extroverts,9
"Quick, knock these runs off before they bring Archer back",8
Y‚Äôall be criticizing the bowling but not give props to Pandey for great shots. Ik y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like him but a good shot is a good shot,22
Pandey looked good all tournament but hasn't played a match winning innings yet. He should take us home today.,10
as long as Hyderabad plays smart cricket and rotates strikes and gets the occasional boundary they should easily win this one,6
We are gonna cross KKR‚Äôs total,5
That was a proper Golf shot!,5
Lord Shankar‚Äôs 4D game to ensure he gets spot in test team,7
"Tyagi is struggling at the big stage. Control is critical at this stage. He is bowling all over the place striving for pace. Minus Jof(who has been phenomenal) rest have been crap. Its almost as if they are bowling on different pitches :-)

I still think RR will win this. No Kane and Manish will screw up at some point.",4
Lol Garg!,3
Pandey for No. 4,3
Thats some shot,5
Pandey looking extra assured today,7
"IPL leading wickettakers lists usually don't represent the best bowlers, but this time with Rabada, Archer, Shami, Chahal, and Bumrah, it is spot on.",9
Pandey should open. Let him get out there and removing Bairstow will open up another overseas spot,4
What happened to Pandeyji?,5
Who is this Pandey,7
Pandey annaaaaaa,8
Any sax scenes in the new Mirzapur S2?,-3
Abhishek and Garg are just having good time whatever is the situation lol,7

Calm down pandey wtf,6

Wow Pandey is actually hitting. Can you believe RR,5
that sound from the bat.,4
Smith saving those overs from archer to let him defened 3 of the last over.,9
Captain Garg really enjoying his U19 mate Tyagi getting smashed there.,9
"WTF Pandey, spare that kid. LMAO",7
" 
Has my wish come true with Pandey being memes back into form?",12

Pandey turned into KKR Pandey,34
I like this PandeyüëçüèΩ,4
"Just an opinion here, but Smith's captaincy has been a let down for RR this year. Like he doesn't know who are his players and where and when they should be used.",14
I heard that sweet sound directly from Dubai.,5
Pandey just said Fuck you to Swann.,10
Wow! props to the bowler for bowling all balls on the same length even after getting hammered all around.,7
Rajpoot advising Tyagi.,6
Please pandey don‚Äôt spoil the tournament with your meaningless knock at this point . Your team is out of the race anyway .,-16
"Wow, Pandey on fire.",7
Lol Nadeem there is sitting there in shorts without a Jersey confident he won't have to come and bat.,7
Good thing Rajpoot is there for tyagi. He knows a thing or two about being spanked silly every match,14
"Damn, Pandey ji is on a mission.",6
Tyagi's got to be fuller and straighter.,6
Pandey is on üî• tonight!,6
"Nice one, Pandeyji",6
My god Pandey ji you are good üëå,5
Hoping 2021 is better. Heartbroken this time though!,2
congrats SRH good game,6
Pandey God wtf,4
Tyagi getting the Tushar treatment,8
r/Cricket you were meant to meme Sanju into form not Pandey!,12
Pandey looks pissed,9
"Pandeyji read y'all comments and has something to say:

Fuck r/cricket",8
"Shami, Chahal, Bumrah being the Indians in top 5 wickets is boring. We already knew they‚Äôre the best. Was hoping for some fresh Indian talent",4
Oh my,1
"So how many players you want to meme into form ?

r/cricket : Yes.",10
God DAMN that was some shot,5
Bring back archer,1
"Did somebody freaking memed Pandey into form?


Fucking hell.",8
Warner should get rid of that abomination from his face.,5
who tf expected Pandey to be smashing sixes today,4
Dear Steve Smith: There's no point holding Archer back for the death overs if SRH are going to hit the target before you get there.,8
Manish Pandey woke up feeling dangerous,8
2 wickets by jofra and yet SRH cross 50 in the powerplay. Rest of RR is shit.,3
Pandey 2014 final vibes,5
Hello 911? I've just seen a murder,7
Unadkat giving private tuitions to RR bowlers and I think Archer missed the session,6
Where the fuck is Pandey apology thread,3
"Another six, calm down Pandey ji. What is this. Am in love",3
Pandey was Doped.,2
Pandey apology thread coming soon,5
"When CSK, KXIP,  SRH fans pray, SRH cannot lose.",3
Last ball had to be a six with Rajpoot advising him,11
Pandey absorbed Warner and Bairstows essence when they got dismissed,4
Pandey just showed his middle finger to Swann,0
Pandey has already hit as many sixes as RR did in their whole innings,2
Powerplays and Manish are things that are meant to be together but fate doesn't allow it.,1

Should have brought gopal in after the 2 wickets,2
97 in 84. Seems doable with sensible batting.. no?,2
Meanwhile 3D 2(7),3
"Here's 9 words I never thought I'd say,

Manish, please do a comeback like Siraj did yesterday",2
Pandey already highest score of the match lmao,3
Guys have we mEmEd Pandey ji iNtO fOrM?,5
"Someone other than Jof do something, please.",1
Fucking play archer as much as you can,2
Where em toxic cunts who are always abusing Pandey on this sub?,5
Now meme shankar back into form r/cricket,7
Warner : where was this Manish all this time ?,1
What's up with the meme players doing well,-1
What are they saving Archer for?,4
Archer pls train the bowlers,2
Pandey striking at 200,7
97 off 83. Only SRH can lose it from here,4
"3D trynna sneak into the numbe 4 spot for the Australian tour

Test obv",4
"This Kamala Prasand commercial so over the top, makes me cringe every time",4
wtf is happening?,5
KKR are you watching,9
SRH made 58 in the powerplay last match as well and still failed to chase down the target. There is hope for RR still,11
"Tyagi's not having a good night. He's trying to bring the ball in to the right hander, if its short, he's going down leg side for wide. If he's too far outside off, with the field up, he's getting belted through covers or straight down the ground.",5
"Young teenage Indian bowler struggling, not one of the overseas glamour boys come and put a hand on his shoulder. Great camaraderie.",5
"Tewatia, Dhawan, Pandey                                                                  CSK Probably- Aap chronology samjhiye",8
Swann should apologise to Pandey for calling him a worse batsman than Bairstow..,8
Such an impactful innings from Pandey. Those two up to gone for cheap should've broken this chase a bit but it's completely back on track now. Poor Tyagi.,8
I solved it. Pandey needs his partner to play like shitty version of Pandey at the other end to unleash himself. All Kane had to do was to strike at 50SR and Pandey would have been playing this masterclass  much earlier.,20
Bhuvi transferred his bowling powers to Shankar and Kane has transferred his powers to Manish,8
Vijay Shankar just needs to play a supporting role for Pandey,3
SRH have to be vary of only 2 player to win this match - Archer and Vijay,5
"Aussie ex cricketer tells an IPL team he wants to be in the support staff.

Indian owner: Son of bitch, you're in.",20
"Archer should've got the 3rd over while RR had the momentum.


Captaincy choices have been weird this IPL.",18
Is Riyan pansexual? That would make him Pan Parag,19
Pandey isn't gonna get out against spin. 3D and Pandey have more chances of getting out trying to slog then to spin.,5
Shankar looks like a discount Sanjay Dutt.,5
"Now they just need to bat till the 20th over, without losing more than a couple of wickets, to win the match. The required rate is down to 7. So, that won't be an issue",3
When the fuck was Pandey so bad that he deserves such [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jfydvx/match_thread_40th_match_rajasthan_royals_v/g9ntm9y?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),2
"Just joined , such a shame that SRH cannot find a place for Kane.",-13
Why exactly did SRH go with Warner for captaincy over Kane? IMO Kane is a better captain,2
Why is Vijay called 3D here again?,2
Need to bring back Archer before it's too late.,6
"unrelated: its actually good to see RR playing in pink and SRH in orange.

a few years ago, every team was blue",11
Shankar with threatening 40 strike rate.,6
4 of 10 from our 3D boi. Just hoping he pulls out a Tewatia.,3
"Considering spinners are RR's strength apart from Joffra, hope Pandey ji and Vijay babu focus on singles and doubles.",1
Pandey was the first Indian to score a 100 in IPL. I still remember the knock. Watched it with my cousin's roommates. Pandey was cross batting sixes over long on and long off.,6
3D going the Thala way.,5
"I'd say bairstow out, Kane in",1
Who is this guy and what has he done with the real Manish Pandey?,7
The battle of the Lengends: Vijay vs Tewatia,4
Jofra deserves better team...smh,6
Josh needs to create more josh for its ads. They're atrocious,-1
Pandey taking a leaf out of poorans book. Just attack regardless of situation .,3
a few more years of commentary and swanny's gonna find himself in a lot of shit. he has no control over himself. something super-offensive is gonna slip out..eventually ‚è≥üçø,7
"As the dugout said

Manish is a great Robin, but a shitty Batman",6
Aakash Chopra used to be an OK commentator 2-3 years ago. He has been awful since turning to those cringy puns.,4
Is mcdonald on social media. I gotta talk with him,2
Any takers for my bet that Shankar's strike rate will be < 50%,-1
Vijay Shankar has transformed from South Indian serial star to a lead star of a rock band,5
M Pandey actually decent today,1
I dropped Mirzapur bcoz Pandeyji is on song,4
"Not gonna lie, I enjoyed seeing Karthik Tyagi being hit.",0
Need Pandey ji‚Äôs wicket asap,5
Pandey‚Äôs actually good today,6
Lord kind of looks like Prince of Persia with this facial hair.,6
Just a reminder that Lord tewatia beat some random Australian leg spinner called Shane Warne in a net session leg spin accuracy competition,14
Gosh I just want to see someone hit tewatia for a 6,7
Shankar... Assist a bit,5
Unstoppable force vs Unremovable Object,1
ENG fans was Swann a good spin bowler for ENG?,12
Rr suddenly seem to have given up .,2
Tom Curran robbed,4
Maney Pandey is ensuring that his ex-team stays at the number 4 position. He is still KKR by heart.,12
i really hope one of these 2 guys smack tewatia's cocky ass,2
"So, 3D is trying to play the Nidahas Trophy final kind of a role here? I swear I have seen him bat much better than this.",4
Rahul Tewatia shaved looks like Vir Das would play him in a bollywood film about the origins of the lord.,6
3D doing 3D things,2
Are you stupid smith?,0
With RR you get a vibe that overseas players hangout on the top floor while the Indian players are in a huddle in the basement.,8
lord vs lord,2
I was scared bit when shankar crossed 50 strike rate. Good that he is balancing with dot ball then took a single. Consistent fellow I like him,3
These guys really love I N T E N T,5
Who's Lomror in for?,2
Stokes played too slow today. No other excuse for RR i guess.,7
"SRH has such a weak batting, 2 out and you have Vijay Shankar ......smh",2
2d from Shankar,1
"*You should have an aggressive intent to bowl the slow ball*

The word 'Intent' has been milked so hard, it's near to irritating now",5
87 off 72 ez pz,6
How much are players paid for each game?,0
Beautiful Anchoring innings,1
Play archerr,2
Pandey's showing lot of intent today,4
If they get pandey I think it's game on,2
We did it we memed Manish pandey back into form,4
"When I stopped watching pandey started hitting boundaries, then I turn on lights, TV everything they are taking singles. Smh",7
Just take 6 rpo for the next 7-8 overs with the occasional boundary,3
The only things which can stop SRH from winning are Archer and Vijay Shankar,8
"He is in Trouble, looks out",3
Why does Manish play like that when he can play like this?,5
"Bairstow and Warner: out for 14

Steve Smith: this little manoeuvre is going to cost us 51 runs",8
Pad first,1
Except archer. No overseas is showing any intent.,3
No no no not now,1
impact outside,3
Impact outside off,2
Looks plumb to me,2
"Impack out, not out",2
Impact outside,3
Something about smith's face always makes me cheer for his side no matter what lol,9
Not out. Outside line of off stump,3
Love this no non-sense third umpire.,10
Are you serious? Play archer ffs.,4
Impact outside or umpire call,0
Fine margins,1
Wtf is the use of *I M P A C T* in lbw?,7
"This maybe not out but something is wrong with the system! Even if pad wasn‚Äôt there, just clearly would have deflect it the bat.",-4
Phewww,0
Is impact outside off never out? Pitching outside off is out in this case right?,3
Uffff Pandey bhai pls,1
3D lost one D with poor catching but adding another D with test batting to balance out his 3Dness.,3
Rock and roll,0
"we need to target the weak bowlers.   
getting the singles  keeping run rate in check won't work for us.",3
Lol the Dugout was so damn sure he was out..,12
Uh without ball tracking also you could see the impact was outside in the replay,7
Shankar looks like batman while batting in SRH outfit,4
Murali strikes me as a Sanju fanboi,1
Can the players on field see the tracking thing too? On the big screen,3
[deleted],0
"Another one, super man pandey. Fifty?",2
Samson competing with Pant even in behind the wicket chatting,1
"yeah we‚Äôve lost this one folks, time to pack up",-2
Why hasn't Tyagi's coach worked on his bowling correction yet?,2
After 4 good balls and how can you ball suck a rank short ball?,4
"Hello I am American, new to cricket. Why doesn't Manish Pandey play for India at # 4 ?",1
"r/cricket bringing meme players to form since ages.

Next: Jadhav tomorrow.",17
Why does the ball has to stay in that line? So stupid. The job of a spinner is to deceive the batsman.,6
Shankar Vs Gopal. The two most popular Hindu Gods are duking it out there in the middle.,15
"Pandey 

Noice üëè",5
Manish Pandey saw Ankit Rajpoot and David Miller so he thought he was playing Punjab ffs,15
Pandey 50 in 28 balls. Nice.,16
"We need an ""intent"" counter from next match. I've heard it atleast 4 times in the last 20 minutes",3
"Perfect strategy by Pandey. Defend tough balls, go after bad balls",9
Peak Pandey is in the house,5
Fuck time out,3
"Ladies and gentlemen, **Pandey** is here and he's gonna win this one.",6
Hindsight but man one more from Archer to try and get Pandey could've made a difference,3
Pandey not playing a statpadding innings. Awesome!,5
Ankit rajpoot bol dalay ye khota kiyun dal raha hai,1
Manish Anna.....,11
Jofra deserves better,8
See ya next year rr,6
What does impact outside means?,3
Manish has 42 from 8 balls in boundaries and have 7 runs from his rest of the 19 balls.,6
Can someone please tell Swann to apologize to Pandey for calling him a lesser batsman than Bairstow,17
Excellent.... should stay to finish the match,6
Should have gone for the kill giving Archer another over,6
"Just saying, if Pollard was batting, that umpire would have given him out. Then Pollard would do something passive-aggresive",14
Pandey gonna wrap it all in 18 overs,7
"Manish Pandey playing amazing, not forcing anything. Willing to take dots, picking his shots nicely",12
"Guys, I am on my bed,if rr dies , I will die. There is nothing in between",12
Pandeyji wildin damn,7
Not enough people giving credit to Pandey in this thread for some exceptional batting as much as they shit on him when he's struggling,15
"I love that 3rd umpire, didn‚Äôt waste time, straight to business",8
Sanga keeping the INTENT flag flying high after KP's departure!,2
That lenskart ad. LOL!,7
The biggest achievement of r/cricket would be bringing jadhav to form tomorrow,25
"There won't be any death overs at this rate, stop saving archer. Bring him into the attack now ffs",3
Serial downvoter is here,1
Can't wait for stokes to blame this loss on others in the changing room,1
RR are about two good bowlers short from being a play off contender.,6
"I know Pandey's going great at the other end, but Shankar at least has to strike at a run a ball to not put pressure on Pandey, even if the RRR is just above 7 now. One or two good overs and it could rise, and considering their batting to come, they don't want to take it to the end.",5
Pandey apology thread? r/cricket??,14
Fucking bring archerrrrrr,1
exemplary intent Pandeyji!,4
Which app do you guys for the match thread? My reddit-stream is expired,5
"my PC every 15 minutes or so: ""Okay 1,2, many mother lovers be around ya""",7
"Pitch pe khade on duty, bajaye hai Pandeyji siti",1
Can't believe this scorecard Williamson playing with Pandey's mask ?,6
I'm rooting for the Timeout for a breakthrough. Yes we're that bad lol,-1
"Traditionally, we lose a wicket after strategic time out",3
Thanks Kris Srikanth. Now I think of Jadhav when that scooter ad is playing,19
Wicket incoming after timeout?,-1
Cmon Manish Anna win it for us,6
Lord get pandey!,-2
Why tf no archer?,-4
For Virat shooting for commercials must almost be a full time job.,3
"I hereby take back everything r/cricket said about you, Manish.",3
My heart skipped a beat,1
"Calm down Pandey, of get out then situation will change completely. Play sensibly and play till you finish the game.",-3
Foakes would have caught that between his legs.,1
9(15) is THE most Vijay-Shankar stat line,5
Smudge should bowl himself.,3
Shankar ffs show some intent,-4
Vijay Shankar is a useless appendage .. don't even know why he is vacationing on the pitch rn,1
"If Pandey gets out soon, Shankar is gonna choke this one for SRH",1
Off topic but Mirzapur 2 has arrived a day early,5
"Bruh wtf. For what are you saving archer,bc smith",0
Shankar is looking to maintain that 50 strike rate no matter what,3
Shankar Anna is weird. He just doesn't want to hit at all. When he does hit it he is gone.,2
Has smith ever bowled in ipl?,0
Shankar atleast rotate the strike,2
One rule change I'd implement is giving 5 overs to bowlers in t20 tbh. I think Warne suggested this thinking it's better for the bowlers but it's pretty good for batsmen as well lol since they can field another Batsman.,2
God this Shankar is so 0-D its not even funny,-2
Lol cricbuzz bolded **49** in their commentary,4
there is a downvote buffoon going around now I see .. best to wait a few,9
Hoping we don't see the customary wicket after break,2
Thala Shankar,7
Why did they drop Sharma. He showed so much more potential than this Shankar fraud,-2
"This is classic Manish, already has played out 9 dot balls today, but unlike most of his Innings, he made up for it today with more Boundaries.",5
Waiting for Shankar to show \*INTENT\*,1
Vijay Shankar is our only saviour,2
I gotta make some tea for me to calm down. RR are just so infuriating,2
"Come on Shankar, unless you're planning a Tewatia, the dots are piling up too fast.",3
FFS justify your all-rounder status you dumb cunt. Perform with the bat atleast once.All we are asking in this game is rotate strike and support Pandey,2
I am not perfect,1
Future Tamil Nadu chief minister is soo handsomeüòç,-6
 Havent seen much turn today.,2
Rahane last year batted better and captained better than what Smith is doing now.,8
Vijay Shankar‚Äôs wicket can cost RR the match,9
Shankar acts like next ball he's facing would a boundary but moves all around and dot. I've never seen play one innings confidently.,4
Honestly they are batting very sensibly knowing that there is fire power to come w it h samad and holder,5
"Shankar Shankar

Don't do a CSK",5
Kris Srikanth is such a sore loser he just had a heartburn that Thala dropped his lovely son from CSK,-12
"*downvote buffoon exists*

""Downvote karne do.. Takleef hua hai bechare ko!""",6
Shankar the team's all-rounder for test team in Australia,1
Man.. that lifebuoy ad is pure cringe lol,-1
Dhoni is gonna score 70* or so and win 1 match for CSK because r/cricket will meme him into form. I just hope it is not against RCB.,2
Shankar has to go,5
" [https://www.iplt20.com/video/129433/vijay-shankar-s-counter-attacking-54-31-](https://www.iplt20.com/video/129433/vijay-shankar-s-counter-attacking-54-31-)   
Can't believe that this was the same guy 2 years ago.",10
"Good running take singles, they will bowl bad balls",9
"*from cricbuzz*-

>All the efforts of Jofra with the new ball going down the track. It was a sight to be honest, one of the better spells I've ever watched.

Sums up RR bowling.",10
I'm upvoting. I'm doing my job. Do yours. Fuck the downvoters,14
I think ABD was at gunpoint doing that lifebuoy ad,5
shankar is recreating his nidhas trophy innings,8
No stoke of luck.,6
This way pandey has to get a 100 for them to win,5
[deleted],1
11(19) is not really okay sunker,3
Pandey is more consistent than Samson and even he's not that consistent to get nod ahead of Iyer. Tells you where Samson stands üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,-2
Stokes just found out how guptill felt in the WC final,4
"What a shot, smacked it so well. Even that brilliant fielding couldn't stop that.",7
Lol Stokes having a bad day all around,3
Shankar needs to score atleast at 100. Not put pressure on pandey,1
What does it take to bring archer in???,3
"Nothing is going right for Stokesy till now in this IPL. Bad timing while batting, not being able to save boundaries even after diving.",8
"We have such shit bowling lineup. Poor jofra,he must be so annoyed by bowling along with these bowlers",3
"I love this manish Pandey, dominating in the pp and slowing it down and batting sensibly after pp",9
manish anna kiraak,8
"Stokes has been very underwhelming, but maybe it‚Äôs a 6D chess move by Smith for the next ashes",5
Yes yes. Please give the strike to Shankar :),4
"Ben Stokes, had he stayed back in NZ , wouldn't have made a tiny bit difference in RR's fortunes.",7
sanju wants 1 wicket .. lol,3
Shankar did a decent job by playing second fiddle after losing Warner and Bairstow early. Should play more positively now and take his SR to 120.,9
A sweet lofted inside out from 3D,5
Shankar is very talented but has a terrible temperament,10
Pandey should be a model wtf,17
Just wanted rr to play the most matches and go deep because of the sheer exciting hitters on paper . But they have completely underwhelmed in 10 games .,5
Even 3D is hitting now. Bring Jof ffs,3
We are gonna lose :(,7
3D shots only,6
Smith cannot really be blamed for this. The RR management and owners have given him one top notch bowler. Just one.  And to make it worse he has Indian bowlers like Unadkar and Rajpoot to pick from.,10
"Inside out lofted shots seem to be rare these days, no?",2
Shot. That was nicely played.,0
I SAW THAT SHOT IN 3-D  like Shiva Ka Insaaf !!,3
Thank you Shankar anna!,1
Playing both Warner and YJB has become liability for SRH Kanos and Nabi has to sit out. In 2018 Shakib and Nabi played a very crucial role for SRH and Kanos was at his peak. With Rashid and automatic selection having YJB/Warner at the top reduces the middle order flexibility which Nabi/Shakib used to bring.,2
"So, RR can't bat and can't bowl. That's pathetic",6
Shankar shitting on /r/Cricket . Few things never change,15
Holy shit,1
"Tewatia has been rr's lead spinner and finisher

Tru lord",7
"RR really don't have anyone apart from Archer, and that sucks. Shreyas has been disappointing this year",5
Manish Pandey effortlessly playing between power shots and light singles,7
" Beautiful shots, 2 boundaries at same place. Great placement. Not bad deliveries",2
That's Vijay babu right there üëä,5
hindsight is something something graeme ..,1
Dik erekt,-1
"Smith you Buffoon, how can you not give it to Archer.",5
That's how you silence r/cricket,5
3D unlocking his full potential,4
We're gonna have a joint Manish & Shankar apology thread!?,6
"Match is approaching run a ball stage, which means some funny shit is about to go down",3
I still can't get over Jofra's phenomenal opening spell. He's right up there with KG and Bumrah as the best bowlers in this format.,8
Shankar man of the match for dropping stoke?,4
Shankar's technique has always looked very compact and there really aren't any glaring weaknesses in his game. He has just failed to utilize his potential so far.,4
Oh Snap... are we going to have another apology thread today?,5
Bangar has good insights but he's so SLOW in explaining. He understands cricket but is terrible at making it presentable,10
Thankfully Pandey didn‚Äôt do anything stupid with his beard like the others,3
At this rate Umesh will comeback into the team and will Fuck r/cricket,1
"Majority of these ads are so cringy but whitehat has to be the one takes the cake for the most cringiest, with that 2 year old that is coding",2
How do they randomly pull up these stats on dugout? Isnt that a lot of data collection?,0
First of all this match doesn‚Äôt have much consequences for the other 6 teams. Second of all it‚Äôs been boring in itself. Probably the most boring game yet,0
Archer and Tewatia trying to drag the team to 4th place and the rest of the team are trying their best to make sure it doesn't happen,2
Smith should have given Archer that 3rd over when he was on fire,4
"Shankar was disappointed because that first boundary was along the ground, so he did it again, but more aerial, thus adding another dimension",9
This entire week r/cricket has been thrown their shit back at em lmao and I am  gulity of it too,5
"r/cricket, Vijay Shankar apology thread when?",1
Shankar going to blast Jofra into 3D orbit.,2
"3D started hitting at the 20th ball, just like the Lord. Another fuck you to r/cricket.",4
Rr prepared for Warner and bairstow. Pandey came out of syllabus,5
Big test for Shankar. Play out archet,4
Oh no jof is here,5
Now shankar gonna smack Archer for a six,3
"I don‚Äôt even care if this is a maiden over, we get catch up against other bowlers",3
"i remember someone commenting 'please meme that useless pandey into form' today

the power of r/cricket is too strong",2
There is no scoreboard pressure. Why is Kartik making such a big deal of Shankar's innings.  And just like that his strike rate is fine.,5
Stokes' face in his little mugshot is so funny to me,1
That‚Äôs the thing with RR I said it at the start of the tournament but Archer is carrying that bowling lineup. Arguably the weakest after CSK.,5
Dogout is so cool. I should have subscribed way earlier.,3
Shankar showing Koach the solidity he missed by dropping him after 2 WC matches.,0
PLAY HIM OFF,4
The poll voters are drunk.,14
Instead of Curran and Stokes Royals should have gone for Archer- Thomas duo of  brutal pace like Rabada-Nortje.,2
Which are the teams who d be happy witha srh win today ?,1
Archer York him,3
Target is small please play out Archer. Won't care if it is a maiden.,12
"Stokes is having a terrible time today. Shit batting, unlucky fielding and not-so-great bowling.",6
RR really need a strike bowler who can take wickets apart from Archer,6
Ok Pandey take Archer apart or at least don't get out to him and prove Swan utterly and totally wrong,3
"Dudes of the sub be confused today as to which thread to create, Manish apology thread or 3D apology thread.",3
"I mean I get it why you all want Smith to bowl Archer now, but he literally has ONE good bowler to work with. How can he span out his 4 over throughout their innings?",1
"No idea who to support, almost dozed off",3
Why are they even playing Jofras balls. Just let them go through to the keeper.,6
"Swanny not calling Jofra by his name and referring to him as Mr T because of his gold chains feels RISKYYYY in 2020

Dugout just doing what dugout does",3
Hello boys,1
"If there was a mega auction and no players could be retained, Jofra would definitely be among the top 5 highest paid",7
Chutiya fan polls,1
Just play him out 3D. Show your shots later,2
"Tyagi didnt fire today. But I like this guy, if he has a sound mind, he can become a good prospect for India.",1
The fan polls are being voted by the same guys who make statements like Jadhav is the best bowler and today Dhoni will hit 200,3
Archer is nearly unplayable. Too bad everyone else is for RR.,6
"Lmao that poll doesn't make sense

Archer and Rashid carry their respective sides bowling attack",6
"Lmao this poll. Rashid is the better bowler, but he has a competent bowling attack around him. Jofra has been carrying this RR attack singlehandedly",19
"Shankar play him off mate, what are you doing. Take single or defend",5
"Shankar :

Talent= Similar talent to Hardik(Not equal)
Temperament= Worse than Mo shami with the bat",4
Lol! RR you so pathetic if you let 3d score a 50 today!,5
Atleast he's doing the smart thing and playing out Archer. 3Defense.,6
manish anna doing suryanamaskar on pitch to recharge .. good signs,8
Wish Archer had some support,15
"Yeah SPD should have given Joffra 3rd over in pp, but at the same time all the other RR bowlers have sucked ass today.",3
Swann being an ass and taking a dig at Murali talking about Rashid's elbow when he was imitating his action earlier in the practice.,7
"Wide, TBH it's over the head.",4
Archer might be happy that was called wide,5
Is Jofra bowling in different match than other RR bowlers?,10
"After this archers isn‚Äôt gonna come till death, block it off bois",13
Vijay shankar doing his night watchman duties perfectly . Protected Pandey against archer 5 balls .,15
‚ÄúUse the extra ball lads‚Äù,8
VS must be like it‚Äôs alright- don‚Äôt give it a wide. Let him go,13
[deleted],7
[removed],9
Vijay successfully protected Manish. What a team man.,16
Can we aknowledge how much of a flash in a pan Tewatia is?,5
FUCK THE DOWNVOTER,9
"Kaat, fair play points kaat. /s",6
One run off the wide? We'll take that off of Archer,2
"They'll still manage to lose this, won't they?

It's hard being SRH fan. :(",-2
Shankar looks like he hasn't slept from so many days.,7
Shankar's FC batting practice is the only thing keeping RR in the game still.,4
"Holder, Garg, Samad, Rashid. Sunrisers should win this easily.",2
Smart Shankar. Better to try and hit other bowlers.,2
It brings me so much joy watching players that get ridiculous hate here do well,18
Good job Shankar for playing out Jofra's over.,5
I will call that a win for 3D. No casualty,4
An apology thread = getting surprised that someone finally did the job they were hired to do.,9
Good over from Shankar,2
"These Dubai Expos are so cringe. Pizza walk, yah right Bacchan ji",10
Someone on this thread getting as much kick out of being a serial downvoter as serial killers or something..,5
This Rajasthan side doesn't deserve Archer.,5
Just see off one more Joffra over and u are done for the day. Easy win.,0
No way we (rr) can win this now. Can we?,7
"Does RR have any fans?

I have a couple of friends from Rajasthan but they support CSK and RCB",2
Yea lets go all the fucking way to dubai to have food in a fucking expo,8
"Great dodging, boys. Definitely wouldn't want to be you. Good job!",1
"Downvoter thinks 3D should be back in the India side. In simpler terms, is retarded",6
I changed the channel ten minutes ago I can't deal with the forthcoming pain,4
Having Cummins as your strike bowler must have felt like a downgrade for Morgan after Archer,15
What a beautiful shot,1
Who would've expected this specific partnership lmao,5
who/what is 3d?,6
Lord bowling to Lord,1
Shankar was the OG Lord when Tewatia was still in diapers. Of course he only played the first half made DK play the second half of a Tewatia.,4

You cant expect more from a player who bats at the position he bats in + he bowls tidy overs and picks wickets occasionally.  
He's good and one of the few bright spots for the royals in a dark campaign. Should be backed STRONGLY.",25
Shankar needs to play out archer here,4

Pandey is so appealing to watch when he bats like this,2
"So, it looks like you cant take a bunch a amazing players form different countries. put them in a team and expect them to win. Maybe works in an exhibition match where there is no pressure. In IPL, Nope!",4

Shankar should now go for it. NRR is very important for SRH,5

Shankar bullying Archer hmmm not surprised tbf,8
Lmao wtf is this,4
Shankar I'm sorry I ever spoke shit about you,4
Rajasthan probably would have a better shot in the playoffs if they could sneak into 4th but looks like that won't happen with this loss. I'm hoping Punjab can take that spot over KKR. We gotta do our job by whoopin em on Saturday,4

Vijay Shankar you are not only ruining Archer's great figures but stopping your teammate getting a hundred. Beautiful batting though.,17

"Sorry 3D boy, Really Sorry",8
Tactical move to prevent Pandey from getting his 100. 3-D indeed,7
Am I right in thinking that Archer should have bowled his third over right at the start when he was taking wickets? Would they have had enough bowling to pick up the slack?,5
"Beautiful batting from lord Shankar, who would have thought, removing beard is the dream11 game changing movment of the match..",4
SRH plan for the chase at the break must have been this. Warner and Bairstow play themselves in scoring 75 or so in 10 overs and chase the rest down in the backend by keeping wickets in hand. Glad that it didn't work out and we are seeing this.,7
Lenskart ads are annoying,2
"After those 2 wickets, even the most hardcore SRH fans didn't imagine that they will be trying to better the freaking NRR.",8

Exactly run a ball. Also known as the most tumultuous times in this IPL,5
"Hattrick fours in the previous match against the SRH‚Äôs strike bowler, similar treatment to RR‚Äôs strike bowler now",4
I think the issue is Shankar is meant to be a proper batsman. He needs time. He isn‚Äôt the kind of player who bats at 6 or 7 to score quick runs. We‚Äôve probably been using him the wrong way. He actually played an innings just like this against Gujarat Lions in 2017.,16

I think scoreboards in the Gulf displaying the reqd. D/L score is a sign of strong optimism.,5
"Can anyone find a legality which makes Jof and Buttler come out of RR, thanks",1

two wickets here will make it interesting,-1

Kane should still come back be it for Bairstow or Holder. First time both have performed have to use it as an outlier rather than expect it next game.,2
"Seriously, great fucking innings from Pandey man, I think SRH can genuinely qualify if he keeps playing like this. He showed intent from the get go despite being 2 wickets down in the first 3 overs

Amazing support by Vijay too tbh, low strike rate but he really didn‚Äôt need to strike it. Good stuff, and nice to see them stepping up",5

"I‚Äôm dumb, still can‚Äôt understand how srh winning favours kxip . Now it‚Äôll be three teams with similar points. Someone help?


Edit - understood now. Thanks so much guys !",8
"Manish hit them so hard, Lord shankar found his form",3
Get kanos for bairstow next match and we're fucking SET,3
"Listen, Sunrisers might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it. Let him write whatever numbers he wants on there, given what he's done since he's come in. Pandey's at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. Sunrisers Hyderabad are BACK.",9
Dugout with Bret Lee and sandpaper jokes.,7
Excellent partnership,3

Battle between CSK and RR for the wooden spoon with Jadhav ensuring he wins it for CSK.,3
Scotty and swanny just ripped AUS a new one,14
Bruh that was savage,8
Good one Scotty!!,9
Dugout - Its not looking good for CSK. Unless there's a Seniors competition coming up. And we are all available!!! Lolz!!!,16
"Holy shit Styris absolutely murdered the cunts there lmaoo

""Like the aussies once told me..if you're not cheating you're not trying""",16
Vijay Anna half century incoming.,4
Brett lee rofl,9

"Damn! Dugout went all aggressive real fast, poor Binga, lol",13
Haha classic fans still shitting on Manish and Shankar. smh,8
"Biryani Boys, please don't screw this up.",16
"They are going to stretch this to last over , aren't they ?",3
And here it goes again! V Shankar will be worshipped in this sub till he fails again next match.,6
"Smudge bowl yourself, you coward",6
Brett Lee just died inside,20
Manish Pandey counter attacking today will be the thing that gets SRH across the line. They were on the back foot and he just took Tyagi for the cleaners who is a pretty decent bowler. Never took any unnecessary risks and never let the run rate get crazy.,5
"Pandey overcompensating the 11cr by batting good

He's the specialist fielder dammit",9
People on shit on Murali Karthik but he had good insights today. Called out Warner for taking the strike against Archer before the innings start and also called out Smith for not giving 3rd over to Archer immediately.,7
I just want Tyagi to get a wicket. The poor guy has been hammered today and it was Pandey's counterattack against him that probably sealed the game. He needs the confidence boost as he's probably the future of Rajastan's death bowling,6
"I believe you Brett. I know you've never cheated.  
A lot of women wished you had though",35
I don't think IPL fans will even notice if RR disappears from the league. Most unIndian least popular franchise of the IPL.,15
I would suggest these two to finish off this game before the last over otherwise SRH might choke. One never knows with these bottom teams,8
"Every analyst asking for Tahir instead of Hazlewood or Curran, just drop Watson man, I have a feeling that he is not gonna perform in the finals.",13
Good to see Indian batsmen showing up for SRH today. Is this the spark the team needs (no connection with MSD spark),11
And to think RR sacked Rahane,10
The fact that Shankar has had two classic consecutive bowling performances now. 4-0-20-1 v/s KKR and 3-0-15-1 today.,22
"Everyone here behaves as if Shankar cost us the World Cup. He bowled well against Pakistan, got injured, and went back home",65
Close this by 19th Over man.,9
"RR,you guys should just dissolve. Dravid and warne pls sue this team",5
Swanne and Scotty absolutely roasting the fuck out of Brett Lee for Sandpaper gate.,23
Lol Swann. Candidly dangerous or Dangerously candid,14

Has a 4th place team ever won an IPL?,1
I still can't believe my eyes,6
This is top class batting from Manish. I hope he would bat with such consistency in the long run.,8
Couldnt let Tyagi go cheaply,7
Sound from Manish's bat is so sweet to hear.,6
Dugout zinger level  ‚ôæ,2

"If you win literally just one game for your team you‚Äôve done a good job. Your team only wins a handful of games in IPL anyway.

4D move by shankar to prove his odi worth,6
RR being consistently inconsistent.,4
"Well I didn't expect this would get chased with an over or so to spare.

Let's hope SRH don't pull a KXIP",6
Smith exposed,2
What‚Äôs the point of selecting Ankit Rajpoot when he bowls just one over every game lol,6
The day in ipl2020 srh played like srh,5
"Why isn't Smith Steve ""executing his skills""/""playing good cricket"" and letting the youngsters show some spark so that they can ""express themselves"", he could have just ""stick to his plans/process"" and come out ""all guns blazing""",2

Is Carlos Braithwaite part of any ipl team this year?,6
Stokes? RR want this over with,3
Virats favorite bowler,10
Scenes if Manish dances after the match like the last match with RR,5
I've seen Shankar get out for 46 many many times. Wont be surprised if he gets out now,6
Bruh. SRH suddenly looking like a well balanced side. All because of a well grown moustache.,15
"for the last time this sub should think twice before shitting any players, enough with these apology threads",13
Does anybody think there should be best of 3 finals?,7
You can't win too many with just 1 bowler army.,11
Pandey ji reminding everyone that it's still the INDIAN Premier League.,6
3D has long levers,2
Dhawan had a very low strike rate but now it's close to 150. He has been really unselfish about personal records and so has played fearlessly,3
[deleted],3
"Rajpoot bowling one over for consecutive matches, why he is even in this team",6
Steve Smith isn't a good T20 captain to be honest. Bowling Unadkat in the 19th over against RCB and not using Archer when he was on song in the first spell are just mistakes you can't make at this level of cricket.,5
3d shankar: Jofra Archer - Destroyed. Ben Stokes: Wait for it...,2
A team with Uthappa in 2020 is bound to fail,1
"The Royals don't deserve Archer, but then again no team probably does...",6
You fucking cunt rr management.  Why u wasted 8 crores for undkat. Couldn't you buy decent batsman and a good bowler,10
"Someone tell me RR have lost this so I can stop coming back to check the thread and get on with my college work, thanks",5
Sikes at this rate Jadhav comes into fo....,5
Yes bowling Stokes at the end in a T20 has historically always gone well for his team,2

The Fairplay award has always been a scam.How are CSK 3rd?Makes no sense,5
"Too bad for Pandey, no opportunity for a 100",5

wasn't Pandey the first indian to score an ipl century ?,19
OMFG Pandey I can't breathe,11
Will 3D boi get his 50?,8
Thing with Manish throughout his career is him being this good in certain matches and then getting out like nothing  or looking out of sorts in another.,9

If Vijay Shankar was our No.4 we would have won the World cup,-4
Let's reverse jinx Jadhav back into form,8
I cant imagine.this guys didn't bid for pooran,4
It‚Äôs pretty clear Shankar is more like Badrinath than Pollard. He can be used as our crisis man rather than a slogger. I still think we are one power hitter short of being a true contender for the title.,17
"Bam, 7th place to 5th. But next they have king's xi, RCB, MI. Not easy",11
"Ben stokes plays for money and fame, there i said it.",6
I was way off. Brilliant knocks from Pandey and 3D shankar. They gave no chance to RR. May be Smith missed a beat in not giving another over to Jofra. All other bowlers lacked teeth today. Still it needed great execution to win this way. Back to back days we have seen great performances from indian players to win the game for the team.,8
Steve Smith is trying his level best to give proper excuses/answers lol,11
Viju is a macho south indian hero.,6
It's pretty sad that no one realises that kkr and srh knocking each other out of playoffs for last 4 years,24
Now even smith said pitches getting better in 2nd innings. Where are the armchair experts who were criticizing dhoni when he said the same?,9
beard was the imposter,13
"Good performance by 3D, but since he dropped that catch of stokes I'd give him 2.5D at best",18
Tewatia in shambles because he didn't get a chance to scream at a fielder,20

WTF is up with everyone's facial hair this season?,10
Before this match almost this whole thread was saying that SRH was playing with only 2 batsmen... Little did we know they meant 3D and Pandey ji,21
Shreyas Gopal is overrated. Atleast in these conditions,4

ngl srh middle order looks strong after this match,19
How exactly do pitches get better over the course of a match? I would think they almost always degrade,4
Mah boi 3d talking very well. Poor soul was taking it to heart and was considering this his do or die game,19
"Why does Ben Stokes play so well for England but not for RR. I mean he's practically superman for them, but has been a bit of a let down for RR",20
You can't win with one good bowler. He will be seen off and the others get smashed.,9
at least Sanju regained some form today. Him and Archer of course were the silver linings,9
2nd highest 3rd wicket partnership in IPL,15
"The Manish Pandey that was promised to Team India but the one that was never delivered.

Hopefully he gets another consistent run in the team. Remember him doing well during the T20i series vs New Zealand",18
Pitch has just a little bit of grass on it - that‚Äôs what I can say about Shankar‚Äôs beard/goatee or whatever we call :),4
Why would they expect to win when they play 2 players out of their batting positions and have no one good enough to support archer.,15
Remember when everyone thought Stokes in the team would mean RR becomes unstoppable. Seems like ages ago,36
Bad day for Tyagi. Taken to cleaners today,10
Lmao KKR at 4 despite being diabolical this season,27
3D hitting a 4 off the first ball of Jofra's final over was the biggest Fuck You ever....... to r/cricket,31
"Steve Smith treats IPL the same way my crush treats me

Fuck no importance or seriousness at all :)",16
Pandey is just unfortunate to be living in the same era as Kohli. He plays the same role as Kohli except Kohli is a lot better. He could probably get into any other team as a first choice player except England. Might even be a decent number 4 for Aus in white ball cricket.,16
Williamson was a problem,11
Holy shit did we shitpost these two to form. Shankar was still very slow though,19

3rd dimension - Drops Stokes so he wastes 15 more balls before getting out",92
Who's the hottie?,7
RR already plays with overseas players that play only half of the season most of the times. This time when they finally play all matches they are still shit. Tough for their fans.,15
"If these two gonna play like this, SRH Middle order have no problems. Warner and Bairstow fan play their natural game. Particularly Warner has been very slowly in this season.",11
Swann needs to shut the fuck up about Pandey's batting. Pandey is a really good batsman. Swann should apologize to Pandey.,20
Pandeymic happened during the pandemic,14
Manish and shankar both stepping up to rescue srh is more satisfying than winning ipl üò≠üò≠üî•üî•,38
"Get rid of stokes, bring in Miller. Butler can open then. Also Rajpoot plays as a specialist one over bowler? Trust him a bit. He ain't that bad. Get a couple of overs from Parag and smudge himself",9
"If Williamson was playing today instead of Holder who got 4 wickets (including run out), they would be chasing 190.",23
"Who is the female host for byju cricket live? She never gets opportunity to speak, sad",11
Ben stokes is a home track bully,12
who is that women in the hindi dugout?,3
Smith- ‚ÄúWe have to keep winning. That‚Äôs our job now‚Äù. You have to start winning to keep winning,23
It is going to be another cracker of a weekend with 4 teams competing for 4th place,15
"Holder did well to make himself undroppable for another couple of matches at least. Considering the current form, I would want Kane to replace Bairstow when he gets fit. But that would open the door for Saha and his 40(50) masterclass. Going to be a tough call.",27
"Saturday's game between KXIP and SRH will be the decider. Whoever loses joins RR & CSK and is probably knocked out. 

So then KKR and either of KXIP/SRH will fight is off for the 4th spot",12
"So SRH/KXIP are right behind KKR for 4th place. SRH is ahead of KXIP but the game on saturday between the 2 teams would decide who has better chance. Based on the game today its anybody's game though previously I was more optimistic on KXIP. Presence of Holder improves their bowling and middle order batting. Plus with Pandey/Shankar scoring runs, it makes Kane less important(if he comes back I dont know who he can replace. To me Warner is the best bet :-) )",16
Both Uthappa and Pandey looked at their 2009 best,9
Will be interesting to see if India go with Iyer or Pandey at 4 next month,5
"Lol! Manish became so rich with one match, with all those awards",19
It's always so funny when one player gets multiple awards and they play the same highlight reel over and over,18
I think there's something wrong with me because I think Warner's moustache is looking good right now,33
Manish SWEEPING,7
Don't let any of this drama distract you from the fact that Tahir will play tomorrow,19
Jofra was not here for that award picture,9
Smith talking about consulting couple of other guys regarding giving Jofra another over in powerplay before ultimately discarding it. I think he is talking about his alter egos.,38
"Aussies really love saying ""obviously""",17
I hear Jew everytime anyone says Dew,12
What are those whistles in the background of presentation?,10
Why is Pandey talking in 2x speed?,21
Bruh who this woman?,7
these rr threads always have half the comments,14
I don‚Äôt think tomorrow‚Äôs result will have any impact on the playoff spot. Is CSK fully out or tgey have an off chance?,12
"One advantage KXIP has is they only have games against bottom 5. Their games against MI/DC/RCB are done. So they have games against KKR, SRH, CSK and RR. They need to beat KKR and SRH and win 1 of CSK and RR to qualify. SRH has games against DC, MI, RCB and KXIP. Wont be easy to win 3 out of 4. KKR has DC, RR, KXIP and CSK. They can hit 7 wins by beating CSK, DC and one of RR/KXIP. If they win both the games against RR and KXIP they will qualify.",17
1st motm for Manish for SRH in 35+ matches,31
Hearing Manish talk reinforces my opinion of him being a player who relies on confidence. That short and wide balls of Tyagi which he middled to boundary in his first over gave him that confidence to take on other bowlers too. He rarely does well when he starts off scratchy. This is where he is behind his fellow U19 contemporary Kohli who could be struggling hard to put bat on the ball but can tee off in a moment like we have seen it many times in International cricket as well as IPL.,31
[deleted],3
Love that IPL montage with music they have at the end of every match/season,23
"SRH's job is simple. Our next match is against KXIP who are on a streak beating the top 3 teams. If we can beat them and break their huge momentum, our chances of making it to playoffs will be quadrupled from 10% to 40%.",27
"Don‚Äôt get too excited fellow SRH fans, 3 of our next 4 games are against the current Top 3",70
"Looks like every other team wants to keep KKR at the 4th position, except KKR themselves.",37
"Depending on how bad KKR continue to be and if the top continues to dominate, I can see another situation where a team with 12 points qualifies for the playoffs",21
3D player finally performed today üëå,36
"That was a comprehensive win. Pandey, holder, shankar have done what they are capable of. The boundaries shankar hit of archer's over were too good. This is the first time SRH had 100+ partnership between indian batsmen.",39
Need DC to beat KKR to make things spicy,20
SRH finally subscribes to Athmnirbhar concept.,25
