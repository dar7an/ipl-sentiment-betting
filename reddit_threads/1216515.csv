DROP MAXWELL FFS!!,10
"Fast forward this match please, we know the story, KXIP will shit the bed

RCB vs CSK is where its at",107
"What's your opinion on the captains, KL or DK?


My respect for KL took a hit when he ran Mayank out. It feels like a shit Teton be in when captain is playing for himself. Most of the team looks demoralized AF. Not what the rest of the staff is doing.",7
Gayle getting a chance today you reckon?,1
"Russell and DK must perform with the bat today, the batting in the last match was carried by only Tripathi.",7
"I've never accused anyone of playing for their stats, but after watching Kl in the WC and the IPL, I'm convinced he plays for personal records",7
"Any chance of 

a) Banton getting a game


b) Morgan batting at 4

?",5
Announce Gayle,7
I'm gonna lose my shit if they play Maxwell today,8
"Dk's captaincy was excellent last game, people need to stop calling for his head purely as captain.",4
Russell & DK have been out of form. If KXIP manages to get out the top 4 they wont have to worry about their death bowling. Also if Gayle plays today what better team to make a comeback against \*2011 flashbacks\*,7
Banton gets to do the challenge atleast.,5
Gayle and Viljoen in for Maxi and Cottrell please,6
"Things seem to be slowly falling in place for us. No idea how the fuck we won the last game but I'll take it. Tripathi needs to play well in order to not give the KKR management any dumb fucking ideas about making Narine open again. Our bowling attack has a lot of variety and depth, and is much improved compared to last year. Now, if only Russell finds an inkling of form with the bat, we'll be fucking unstoppable. 

Of course, now that I've said it, we're prolly gonna make a bunch of dumb fuck decisions and lose like 4 on the trot. Ah, being a KKR fan isn't easy.",9
I'd pay to see Mayank run Rahul out and then score well to take the orange cap away,46
"[Still full from last nights curry](https://i.imgur.com/6l3ifPz.jpg)

Ah",25
What team will KXIP's RTG give today?,5
"I hope KXIP doesn't drop Prabhsimran, he looked good in last match.",3
"Fuck Maxwell btw. I'll always be grateful for 2014 but he's literally not had one good innings since then. Love the guy and he's probably our third best player of all time after Marsh and Bailey, but I'm done with hoping for, ""just one more match"".",8
I'm embarrassed for Kings XI. Hope they win today.,6
Gayle- Yayle or Nayle?,7
"KKR does not have a single player neither in the top 15 run scorers, nor in wicket takers list, but are still placed in top 4 in the points table because in every win they have a new match winner.",8
Any signs of gayle?,2
Lets see what stupid shit KXIP management pull today,13
Punjab never wins toss,1
Kxip players playing rocks papers scissors to see whose turn is it to play today( ofc Maxwell is an exception to this rule),1
It's depressing Kuldeep Yadav can't even get picked in the side after being India's best LOI spinner for some time,6
Jordan 😂😂😂😂,1
FFS JORDAN OF ALL OF THEM?!?!,0
damn it why no ishan porel yet,1
Maxwell still playing lmao,2
Cottrell Injured :(,2
Wow. No Gayle.,2
No Gayle. Maxwell Stays. Jordan in for Cottrell,7
Jordan in for Cottrell has to be the worst change lmao,2
"Wait why the fuck are we playing with 5 full time bowlers again. Bring in neesh ffs.

And fuck this Maxwell again.",5
What the fuck KL,2
So will Jordan or Neesham be brought in to get hit for 50 runs today?,3
"So no Gayle today as well , smh.

Why Mavi was replaced? As far i saw he was doing well",1
"Maxwell gets another game smh

That being said, Gayle was never gonna get a game be realistic lmao

Also, i dont mind Cortrell out. Arshdeep literally did what he was supposed to do but better. 

My only concern is these clowns will send Mandeep down at number 6 again",8
No Gayle again🙄,1
"Rahul looks completely down and dead inside, as that interview progressed his tone became more and more dejected",9
KL Rahul said Cottrell is injured and might miss out multiple games so more of a forced change for those wondering the reasoning,7
"DK's been poor for a lot of this tournament, but I don't think I'll ever go off him. Just love the guy, fantastic cricketer at his best and it's a shame it never worked out at international level for him.",8
Another game with mujeeb as number 7 fuck yeah.,7
"Ahh yes, Mujeeb ur Rahman, the guy with an International batting average of 6 and more LOI wickets than runs.

Definitely a good choice to bat at 7.

Edit 8: Jordan will presumably bat ahead of him.",9
Also hyped to see what Prasidh Krishna can do,3
 Batting average this season -  [\#DineshKarthik](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DineshKarthik?src=hashtag_click) \- 9.8 [\#KLRahul](https://twitter.com/hashtag/KLRahul?src=hashtag_click) \- 62.6,7
How does Maxwell keep getting in? He's one of my favourite batsman to watch in international games but it's obvious that he hasn't merited a position in the team this IPL,10
Is Gayle still sick or something?,4
"Copied from cricbuzz - *KKR does not have a single player neither in the top 15 run scorers, nor in wicket takers list, but are still placed in top 4 in the points table because in every win they have a new match winner.*",10
Lesgoooo,1
If a fast bowler doesn't have a Yorker in his armory. he shouldn't be playing T20 cricket.,5
Bruh if Maxwell has that same useless Batting stance again I'm not even going to bother with this shit. Openers finish the job or it's over.,10
Rahul looks dead from Inside,5
LMAO I JUST FORGOT THAT POORAN WILL BE FACING NARINE AGAIN. END ME.,5
"Make Mayank the Captain, Rahul has no Leadership Quality",-5
Could've tried viljoen if Cottrell is injured and Jordan hasn't been good,5
Kings taking down KKR today will add more chaos to the table.,5
"Me and Rahul are similar

Both of us are dead from inside",6
We want Gayle. This may be his last IPL ffs,8
They are backing Maxwell not because they believe in him but because they spent crazy ass money on him. Benching him will only make that decision look crazier.,3
"I still remember at the start of the season and in his second game everyone was talking about how amazing of a death bowler Jordan was first, then said he just got unlucky lol. I agree hes the best death bowler in the world. No one kills their own team more than this guy. Fuck him, no sympathy for him unless he plays a match winning game. Cost us the game with both ball and bat (harsh but true) vs Delhi.

Lmao @ the freaks downvoting - do you really want to go round 3 with me?",6
"C'mon, KXIP. Win today and make the table a bit more interesting.",7
"KL ""strike rates are very, very overrated"" Rahul",6
Wait guys can we also get a bowler if Cottrell is permanently injured?,5
Ready to be heartbroken again,6
2 mins silence for KXIP's team selection.,5
"I know that KXIP like having bowling allrounders, but I don’t think that they wanted Maxwell to become one.",8
Kxip are going to win this,7
"I want kxip and csk to win today.... So that srh, rcb and kkr fight for two spots with 3 wins-losses a piece and rcb's inevitable exit cuz of their shit nrr",7
"On paper and on field, KKR look far superior so I will have to back Punjab today. Lets go Punjab.",10
[deleted],7
not is chris gayle not getting a game? any particular reason?,3
I'd like to see KXIP break their streak of losses because they have a very talented team but not against us lol,3
[deleted],2
KKR have won the toss and elected to win by runs,7
I love that in the KKR team graphic everyone was giving it a straight face and then there's just Morgan with a full smile,9
Specialist fielder maxwell in playing xi,8
[deleted],-5
Someone wrote an article here talking about how overrated he is as a death bowler and his stats are below average.,3
I just wanna see russel hitting big sixes with those muscle,6
Tripathi is an SRK fanboy lmao,7
Ngl though man I was kinda sad when Jordan got destroyed on his birthday. I hope him and Maxwell redeem themselves today but even half that is a lot to ask for,10
I didn't even know that these 2 had a match today?,0
Neesham >>>>>>>> Jordan!!! Wtf Punjab!,3
Cummins and Arsedeep hope they face each other,7
"People who wish for teams to lose, why? Why can't you pick teams to support instead?",5
Think Zinta and SRK will watch this game together in the stadium.,6
Cowardly omission of the universe boss.,2
I want someone to put in as much faith into me as Rahul puts into Maxwell,4
KKR could get Tripathi to bat again for  Karthik they both look the same under their special helmets,11
"Tripathi for rahane lookalike club??

(Kinda resembles him)",7
"Not a fan of their team selection, but got to appreciate that they didn't make 3 changes this time.",3
maine everest pe football khela hai🎶,3
Either Maxwell food poisoned Gayle or Maxwell's father in law is Kumble,8
Veer v/s Zaara,4
Batting at 2 o clock in UAE. Unimaginable.,4
"Glenn ""2nd most expensive specialist fielder in IPL after Manish Pandey"" Maxwell in playing XI today",4
Can someone tell me what makes mujeeb good in lois despite being an off spinner?,2
looks windy,1
Why isn’t Mavi playing today?,1
"How many years till we see an augmented an edited, customized version of the match ? I would love a Disney themed characters with exaggerated expressions.",3
Are we finally getting into the part of the tourney where spinner's have more of a say?,1
"GILL OFF THE MARK, WITH A FOUR",2
"Russell is in terrible form right?

You know what that means

Russel 80(38)",6
Sunil Narine always turns into a beast v/s KXIP,2
I remember when Mujeeb top scored for the Brisbane Heat batting at 10/11,2
Gill is so good... I'd be very interested to see how he does on fast pitches in Australia and South Africa..,7
Yes Binga please be a coach at KKR,2
binga please save rajasthan royals,1
Btw don't get it twisted. We probably make the playoffs if we had Curran and Ashwin. We gave away Ashwin for peanuts and why did we even let go of Curran?,3
Bangar with the zingers today...,2
Excited to see Arshdeep. I would say he bowled well last match,2
hello hello,2
Arshdeep seems happy go lucky. Would pay top $ to get that kind of mental state back.,4
"I can make a joke on ArshDeep, but I won't.",4
"Good bowling, didn't carried. he impressed in the last game as well.",4
Harsha- Good to see a young man young                                       Shaw- Why you bully me,5
Bc Tripathi,2
“Falls short on KL Rahul”,3
Tripathi is really lucky today,6
Arshdeep is straight up giving me small hope.,6
"3 good deliveries, trupati is in so much pressure. Can expect a wicket here",2
haha.. binga confused awakardly,1
Tripathi what are you doing.,1
Man these small margins have been going against us :/ or not carrying ot whatever,2
Arshdeep Singh shows some promise.. hope he does well,7
"Yooooo Tripathi chill, see him out.",4
"He has got a very innocent, sweet face... Lulls the batsman into a false of security does arshdeep.",9
"Holy shit, idk who this lad is but this is some seriously impressive bowling",10
Dayum,2
Man don't pull an Uthappa here,6
What the fuck is happening,6
Tri party agreement shaky,3
"Arsedeep has the smallest turban I have seen

being bald and a Sikh would be a lucky combo",5
Tripathi really struggling here. 5 balls in a row he almost got out to all,6
tripathi.exe stopped...,7
"5 dot balls, bc still swinging at everything.",4
"Wow, this boi has some arsh for sure!!!",6
please be a sexy maiden,2
Simran Singh graduated from Rishabh Pant annoying wicketkeeping academy.,14
Maiden!!!,4
Good pace from Arsh considering his frame,3
What an over from ADeep. Deserved a wicket but a maiden ain't bad too.,3
"Freaking bowled man!!

What a start!",3
Arshdeep feeling like Akram to Tripathi,3
Arshdeep is a good prospect bowler,1
is that the first maiden in IPL?,-3
What an over,3
Bencho that's why punjabi players are important in this team... At least it's enthu and fun despite the results,6
Oh boy what an over man Arshdeep,6
Man's playing test cricket,7
Phenomenal over,5
Tri party will need to channel inner Watson to make up for that over,4
I'm sorry but I keep hearing ARSE DEEP,2
Bruh arshdeep s GOAT,3
Will Gayle ever step onto field?,3
"Fantastic bowling, who is this kid ?",7
"I thought this is the bowler KKR will go after. And, Tripathy gives them a maiden!!!! 😠",4
tripathi and dk both have that weird looking helmet lol,7
Pressure on Gill now.,3
Is the wk blind or just over excited?,4
"they paid 20 Lakhs for Arsedeep, that maiden cost 1 Lakh",8
I tapped KL Rahul a million times on hotstar in the previous over. Does it show for others?,6
Anyone elses hotstar shitting bricks?,5
"with that Maiden, Chris Jordan can go for 24 in an over",8
"Sikh bros, how much time do you spend daily maintaining your hair ? Serious Q.",17
Arshdeep owned Tripathi in that last over,8
Trips gotta take a toke here and make sure the next ball goes the journey...,1
Tripathi boi what you doing,1
"is that the first maiden in **THIS** IPL?

since everyone got heated",0
"Prabhsimran is definitely high, man. 😭😂",2
Head of Design looking like he has snorted some of his paints,1
Ump's name sounds like gaand hahaha,1
"Rahul ""Watto"" Tripathi.",1
"I think Prabsimran has been brought in to have both KL and Pooran in the outfield. Fielding is an important aspect for this team

Edit: Added advantage of not having either keep and relatively fresher for batting",2
Simran shouts at every chance lmao,5
Six,1
Is this keeper going to celebrate on every ball?,5
Tripathi has forced quit jadhav.exe,8
Great start from the KKR lads,7
"Love tripathi's childlike smile.
So cute :)",1
Ffs Shami what was that ball. The kid was under pressure.,9
Shami what the fuck you been doing for 3 games now,5
[deleted],1
I don't think I've seen 5 false shots in a row in the IPL before.,4
6,0
MI and RCB have the most fluent free flowing openers. they attack in the first 6 overs. don't understand the point of tuktuk early in the innings.,5
What's up with these atrocious camera angles that we're being served each game?,10
Tripathi trying to play out the first session lol,2
KXIP management paid millions for guys like Jordan and Cottrell so played them before Indian pacers. I wonder when will they realise they bought Ishan Porel also.,8
"Shamiiiiii, you beauty",3
Terrible from Tripathi this game,3
"that was brilliant, fuck!",3
Cringe harsha got tripathi out,0
I'm not liking this,1
"Brett Lee just called Sanjay Bangar Sandeep LOL 

Swann had called him something else too the other day",25
r/cricket bringing another player into form.,13
Ouch. Big ouch for Tripathi,7
Put him out of his misery,10
Nothing more pleasing than the sound of stumps going brrr,13
FUCK YEAH FINALLY,8
Godamnnn shami!!!!!!,11
Rattle babyyyy,8
Excellent ball from Shami.,8
"Haat bc, swinging at everything. Deserves to get out like that.",4
Shami should be used outside of power play.,1
Narine was demoted for this hahahaha,-12
No batsman in kkr performs in 2 game in a row huh,12
Is this how it feels to take a wicket in powerplay 🥺,45
Arshdeep messed up Tripathi's game.,13
"**2.4** Mohammed Shami to Tripathi, OUT, timber. Shami bowls seam-up, targetting the stumps, and gets appreciable seam movement from a length outside off, and knocks back the middle stump **12-1**

RA Tripathi  b Mohammed Shami 4 (10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40.00",5
"One of our batsmen has to do a Narine, right?",11
Shamiiiiii,3
Why is the virgin chris in the 11 instead of chad chris,4
Should have watched ball a bit. Wtf swinging at everything tripathi,5
Kxip winning will make the table really interesting,7
Peak Shami is back,7
Dinesh Karthik has to be the luckiest dude on the planet.,5
"It's gotta be the Rana show today. He's had starts but not converted them to something big, like 80+.",2
I sense Gill playing one outside the off stump and edging one to slip / keeper,-1
"He hasn’t shown it consistently but I think that Rana has the potential and talent to play internationally. He is almost extremely good, but just finds ways to get out.

Edit: and he is out for 2.",9
MI exchanging Rana for SKY was one of the best move,4
Kkr coaches should work on Tripathi's composure,7
"Tripathi was so good in his previous match, only batsman who did well for KKR, struggled to do anything today.",7
"Why tf they're not playing Ishan Porel? I thought he's a good alternative, if they don't want to play foreign bowlers.",4
Simran is high. 100%,9
This KXIP keeper appeals every time he gets a hand to the ball,8
"I really think the sunlight is blinding the batsman, my dad just said the same too.",7
Simran stop bro you asking all the time is giving me false hope,4
Is Sunil Narine at 4 really KKR's long term strategy?,6
What the fuck happened there...,6
Shami should be given another over imo,3
"anyone saw kumble's arm fat just swinging around as he claps? 
Kinky ಠ_ಠ",10
Dont know if KKR are messing up or this pitch is really good for bowling...hmmm,3
"KIXP are paying 5.6 crore for Nair & 6.2 crore for Gowtham Krishnappa

I have never even heard of the second guy

KIXP have the worst GM",5
"At this point, KXIP should just play an Indian pacer like Ishan Porel. 

Arshdeep can be the find of the season.",8
How did they make a state farm ad just for American Indians?,7
If this wicket stays the same Cummo may have a field day,4
"I havent been able to even 1 ball properly with 1gbps internet

Wtf hotstar",5
Prasidh with a batting strikerate of 14. Get him in the test side as an opener.,6
Quite impressed KKR have managed to do something even dumber than continuing to have Narine open in having him bat 4 ahead of Morgan,10
Might be a 150/160 game lads. Those are the best matches.,5
Could have sent Narine to score some quick runs in these PowerPlay overs.,3
Legend has it the KXIP keeper is still appealing.,13
Just need to not lose a wicket before lunch,5
Has no one else noticed the similarities between Ambani kids and Nitish Rana ? Also he was in MI earlier.,3
Simran and Arshdeep have more emotions than the whole kxip team,7
The fuck is this random bhangra?,6
What is this fucked up song they are playing WHILE the bowler is bowling! Very distracting,3
What are they chanting,4
This bowling pair are better than any other foreign option they tried in the past,10
lmaaaao,4
bruh 💀,3
Noice,1
Brain dead from Rana,5
"Lol, that is not going to impress any Tendulkar.",6
"With that name, Arshdeep will not enjoying fielding on the boundary in Australia if he ever ends up going",12
PEAK KKR BACK BOIS,8
Hahahaha,6
Holy mother of god,7
Damn wtf,7
Lmao...kkr shitting the bed is good for IPL,9
KKR back to form,9
Lmao what a shambles,10
"Yes yes, nononono NO YAAR",5
Wtf was that,6
Hahahaah worst one yet,6
V I L L A G E,3
Gill kinda sus,17
Lmao we almost fucked that up 🤣,8
"Yep, as someone mentioned Rana does find ways to get out",7
"Wtf was that...

Seems like kkr are high...",8
Run out on the Fashion Runway with Gill and Rana,3
What was Rana even thinking? It went straight to the fielder,4
KKR HAI TAIYAAR,5
SHUT THE FUCK UP BC,1
Inb4 48 ALL OUT.,8
LORD Narine save us from this mess,11
This won't improve things between Gill and Rana,9
KurKuRe crumbling here,7
pooran going for them d11 fantasy points,34
almost a lens kart ad there,11
Lmao peak cricket,9
Smh KXIP where was the Social Distancing next to the stumps????!,11
Something only KKR can pull off.,6
[deleted],0
This is a Pakistan level run out.,30
BHENCHOD. BHAK,9
Ideal situation for Morgan to calm things down and unleash later,7
"Gill should have run!!

It was Rana's call and he was at danger end. The selfish nature of our cricketers is worrying sign.",17
"**3.3** Arshdeep Singh to Shubman Gill, OUT, both batsmen at the same end. Disastrous start for KKR **14-2**

N Rana run out (Mohammed Shami/Pooran) 2 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00",3
KKR players forgot to have their morning coffee before coming in to bat today. WTF!!,7
"Shubman ""inzi"" gill",5
LMFAAAOOOOOooooooo,4
Run outs have been really common for the past few days ngl,4
Damn KXIP going RIGHT today,4
"Seems like the writers have changed their focus from super overs to run outs in the past few games. 

What would be the next major plot line?",9
There is an impostor among us.,4
6d chess moves by kkr ultimately making narine play in the pp,6
Morgan early,5
God bless this comedy of errors,6
"Ishan Porel might be feeling down a bit at this point. 

Not just his team-mates from WC2018 but even the players from the 2020 batch have made their IPL debuts",9
"Ngl I’m an advocate for sending Morgan at 4 but 3 overs seems too early tbh

I’m sure he can handle it tho",6
That was a poorrun,54
Finally Morgan at 4,7
That's on Gill totally.,7
Ok that was a shit run out and all but it gave us the first look at Rana's glorious locks as he walked back,11
R I F T between future Kohli and future Rohit :(,9
Morgan better do something all the Poms in here have been writing strongly worded letters demanding he come in early,8
Morgan at #4? KKR management finally have subscribed to r/cricket.,10
"Offensive joke: Captain Murugan is here.

Women on periods: I'll see myself out.",3
What basis does Maxwell get selected on,4
So which out of form batsman will tear it apart today? I bet it's gonna be a Dre Russ show 🙃,9
Both at fault. First Rana and then gill as well.,7
"Nobody :

CRED Player of the match :

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  \ (•◡•) / (/) (°,,°) (/)¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",50
I have faith in KXIP to still lose this somehow.,3
Narine: I may have left opening but playing in powerplay has never left me,8
It took them a farcical run-out to finally bat Morgan at 4,7
"YOOHOOOOO, didn't pick rana and boom",2
Arshdeep and Simran are Punjabi and are giving their life to this team,12
This test match run rate though,4
Interesting off piste tactic from KXIP here to have their world class no 4 bat at no 4,6
Is anyone else's Hotstar buffering?,1
Finally Eoin at 4. Thank god!!!,7
Morgan at 4 is oddly satisfying,11
how do they select these fans,3
Whose laughter was that? The witch-like?,4
"15 in 4 overs , what a mess",7
Anybody hearing a whatsapp ping sound on the stream?,3
Jesus Arshdeep is better than 8.8 CR Cottrell,10
"Damn, we could have had Indian Murugan bowling to Irish Murugan, but alas. Team selection.",17
There was no run there he hit it straight to the fielder,6
Always knew Punjab's fortune will change once they play us.,17
Arshadeep with an economy of 1.,11
"“We will have a bat first, thanks”",6
[deleted],7
Is this a sign that we're winning our 2nd match ?,9
Jatin Sapru said Prabhsimran has kept wickets many times for Arshdeep Singh. The funny thing is Arshdeep has never played a T20 match for Punjab as he is our Ranji specialist and Prabhsimran has never played a FC match in his life. They have played some List A matches together where Anmol Malhotra was our keeper (maybe once he kept in his absence). Commentators talk without even doing a little bit of research.,26
"That's why Regional players are important I guess, Simran and Arshdeep Genuinely Care for Punjab",11
Welcome back Lord Jordan. We need to keep the game even after all,6
Rohan commentating is as dry as popeye biscuits,5
KKR should've gone bowling first.,4
Is Gayle in the game or is he still “sick”,4
"The young Indian bowlers have been excellent to watch so far and so droolworthy, Mavi, Nagarkoti, Bishnoi, Tyagi and now Arshdeep.

Hope Porel gets an opportunity as well, he performed well in that India A tour of NZ, and after all the changes Punjab has made to the 11, his non selection has been a shocker, especially after how well his U19 batch mates have gone and he's played the most cricket out of them in recent times",8
Worst start this IPL,7
Get Mujeeb in,1
"Whenever I see these runouts, I'm just glad how well Warner and Bairstow run between wickets. Absolute trust in the partner and just drop and run.",9
CSK would be proud with the start :D,7
It would be funny if KXIP lose this game from here.,9
"ffs, where's mYsTeRY sPinNer?",1
They aren't even hitting Jordan lmao,4
KKR trying to one up KXIP in stupidity. At least we get to see Morgan bat at 4.,2
"Perfect time for CJ to bowl, almost imperfect cz we need to attack lol",3
Tuning in to find KKR 2 down already... surely Tom Banton has to get a go at some point???,10
This is the reason i love the test cricket batting! Soo soothing without any care in the world just like Gill on the crease right now,1
Yes finish his overs. I do not want to see him at the death.,5
[deleted],7
"Good job Jordan, make me eat my words today",7
Hopefully KXIP forgot to read their “Somehow we mess up and manage to lose” manual today. Punjab couldn’t have asked for a better start.,7
"Gill is not handling this well , get off the strike man",-3
15/2 in 4.3 lol,3
"Ok so Arsh MIGHT be our best death bowler. 

If you were captain, what would u do? Keep attacking with him? Or save him for later?",7
[deleted],-12
"yesterday's Pant & Stoinis run out was worse

I don't know if Stoinis called no or not but Pant did the right thing trusting his partner and not turning around to see where the ball went",7
"Hey KKR, shitting this badly in the PP was our thing. *cries*",10
Finally,2
Gill is a terrible t20 player.,-4
That was birthday present from Jordan.,5
Some actual analysis from the commentators. We've entered into the twilight zone.,6
This might go on to be one of the lowest power play scores this season,8
Morgan's form is a big worry for us. Might wanna tty out Banton soon.,6
That’s more like the Jordan we know.,6
19/2 after 5. What a joke,5
Dinesh Karthik without beard looks like Vikrant Massey,7
"""KKR, KKR, KKR."" - Okay",9
How good of a bowler is Prasidh Krishna,1
This is dream start for KXIP but they may find ways to screw this up somehow,4
Unless Russell goes on a mad one we have no chance of winning,8
off topic / unpopular opinion : Yashaswi Jaiswal isn't all that and is overhyped by people.,-6
DM!!!!,1
"Jordon has done what he has to do, FREAK!",8
Bowl Arshdeep mate,4
I have a feeling Andre Russell will go nuclear to spoil all that Kings XI have so far gained in this match.,11
im just waiting to see how KXIP will fuck this uo,15
"Projected score based on current scoring rate:

76/8 (20)

Will they reach it?",10
"Everything about the fake chants, fake crowd noise is pathetic. I wish they give an option to watch the match without this.",9
"Gill, Iyer, Pandey etc are natural ODI players, they struggle in T20 a little. They're not bad, but you just can see it.",11
"Good. One over of shami in the death is what they should be doing, anymore and they are in trouble",6
There's only a few teams that could lose from here and KXIP is one of them,12
"I’m generally proud of the heritage and culture of my country, the exception being when I see that MXTakaTak ad",9
So I was outside in the garden and I knew Morgan was in when I heard a “Noooooo”.,51
They figured out Morgan lol. He's a dummy against bouncers,11
"Ok, that was a very smart set-up, well bowled shami",3
"Now bowlers have done well for punjab.

So now batsmen will fuck this up somehow for them.",13
Shami is so good when he is on song.,9
Not sure if Morgan or Raina?,5
The moment you drop Bumrah and Shami from your fantasy  team - they are back in form .,22
Who's this new guy in the Select Dugout?,4
Shami NO,4
Cant bowl half hearted bouncers Shami. When will u get rid of this habit,9
"KXIP's job: Bring out of form players/teams into form.

Dre Russell. Hmm.",13
Short ball is a risk against Morgan - you'll either get him out or get hooked for 6 three times in the over,50
"That's some good captaincy from DK, giving Shami his 3rd.  They need to get Morgan's wicket.",1
Talking about csk again.,4
Is this the lowest score in the power play this season?,5
"This bowling performance looking similar to that against MI..
Rahul is going overboard now with shami bowling the 3rd over..
Might get trickier in backend of the innings",4
2 matches today and It’s going to be a day of who can mess it up more . Let’s see who comes up the winner today,5
"We’ve seen a short ball and a full ball. I predict that we will now see a short, length, or full ball.",3
"""Look, I think strike rate is very, very over-rated. For me, it's only about how I can win games for my team. ""

But Rahul, the problem is that the team isn't really winning any games rn.",96
25/2 in power play lol,10
Stage is set for a perfect Thala innings from Rahul 50(55) *,24
"Sam Curran is a cut-throat, bouncer to Morgan while brother Tom was dropping him",17
"I think punjab figured some pieces in the Hyderabad match even if they lost. Arshdeep, simran bishnoi have shown they are up for it. Pooran firing also put some confidence in the middle order. 

Now they need their big hitters to play confidently and they can do damage",13
"I thought CSK was playing the next game, not this one.",13
Inb4 Russel comes and doubles the score in an over,12
daily reminder for people to not buy CEAT for putting the evil that is the sTrAtEgIc TiMe OuT on us.,6
Mujeeb has been bad In IPL,5
"""Second time Morgan has come in this high""

- Bish Alex Hales-ing Morgan over there",11
Almost half way in the tournament and not once apart from those 2 overs by Morgan and Tripathi in the DC match have we seen consistent solid hitting by KKR.,10
I think morgan might struggle against mujeeb.,3
Mujeeb pls ball well,6
I am gonna get downvoted but Shubmans batting puts pressure on his own teammates. He needs to play with a little bit more courage.,17
Gill be a Loyal Punjabi and get out pls,7
Tuned in late i see its CSK in purple vs CSK in red,12
"Haven't watched porn or Masturbated for 3 days. The withdrawals are real, lol. 

Hopefully IPL matches would be helpful",13
“one wicket chahiye” okay who brought pant on the field,43
"KXIP is playing with 2 batsmen, 3 wicketkeepers, 5 bowlers and Maxwell today.",42
Idk who that is shouting from Punjab but keep it up,9
I've watched the IPL for a few days now and don't think anyone has got a wicket alert right,14
Mujeeb bowling so Short,10
Noggin Morgan.,9
"Banton & Chris Lynn are the most wasted Overseas players ATM

0 games 3 weeks in",9
Nice shouting Prabh lol,13
Morgan: I need coffee!,7
Morgan don't care if it hits him in the face again.,12
"Even though summer is over, today's weather is bloody hot and humid compared to previous days.

damn arshdeep’s been great,9
Hahahaha *boop*,8
Simran Singh reminding me of Kamran Akmal.,1
What did M. Ashwin do to get dropped? Mujeeb is bowling trash,0
"***gets hit in the head playing reverse sweep***

Morgan : imma do that again",10
Here's some random Saturday afternoon [thumbnail gore](https://i.imgur.com/RGlB7Bj.png).,7
They should target a couple of bowlers now... Else KXIP can strangle KKR for a beliw par score,2
"KXIP look like Mumbai ,I almost can't believe it,but we have an equally good pace attack so it's not as bad so far",4
I hate it when I tune in the first time and its a time out,11
They need to target at least 170.,9
"Arshdeeps over made a huge difference, beating the batsman often puts the batting under pressure which led to their subsequent mistakes",9
Why does Jordan have a black full sleeve on his right arm?,4
Abhinav Mukund is the best Indian voice I heard in the dugout,8
Ganguly's acting is cringe af,15
"So, KXIP has a max 12 overs of **pace** in their line-up. Right? And they have already bowled 7 overs of pace in the first 8. So, there will be 7 overs of spin in the last 12?? I don't think KKR batters would mind that at all.

And, high probability of Narine coming to bat next.",11
"Brian Lara: ""Set up the game for the Andre Russel and Pat Cummins to come later on""",22
Was rooty not picked by any franchise?,9
My remote’s working overtime thanks these bs commentators,7
"***any cricketer going at round about a run a ball***

/r/cricket : Is ThIs DhOnI?",18
"Nice repair work by both with 100 SR.

Now they will look to capitalise in next 42 overs.",12
I think Morgan will be Bishnoi's first victim today.,6
we would have to agree if kxip wins the tournament opens up,1
"Good ODI innings, but are scoring at 100 strike rate
 No problem guys still 42 overs are there",8
Swann in the dugout : The boys can't have enough of me.,9
Abhinav Mukund is an eloquent speaker. Enjoying his commentary so far.,8
Who's the target audience for Viru's vim ads?,9
Need to break this partnership. A set Morgan will bat KXIP out of the game.,5
for fucks sake at least go over 6 rpo,3
Nobody balds more gracefully than Sehwag,7
"Get bishnoi in ffs, the last over was peak filler shit",6
Ah Bishnoi is here yay!,4
Mujeeb speaks urdu?,3
"Morgan's weakness is a quick bumper on his head, have seen him a lot of times getting out while hooking/pulling",4
This takatak song/ad from Badshah is a tough pill to swallow for my ears,2
"I really wanna get on commentary and say shit like 

*I'd say the team that scores the most number of 1s, 2s & 3s along with the boundaries, added together has a strong chance of winning the match.* 

*This is what champions like Kohli, Dhoni and Smith focus on, you know, running between the wickets and boundaries*",67
Ofc Prabh appeals 🤣,5
"Off topic, I've a few questions.   
1. I need to pay credit card bills. What's the easiest way to do it?  
2. Looking for all season tyres. Which one's the best?  
3. Best hatchback money can buy?",17
"BISHI BOIIII, hope you get a 4-fer today",2
"Not in context of this match, but would love to Gill bat with Kohli in International cricket.",4
Why didn’t Mujeeb/KXIP get fined for cheating last game?,0
"People think it's a foregone conclusion with Padikkal, but I wouldn't be surprised if Bishnoi becomes the emerging player of the tournament.",10
"Play straight or go with your preferred mid wicket region.

These reverse sweeps are looking ugly. Looks like he can't play spin to save his life.",-3
Morgan reverse sweeping both leggie and offie. \#Equality,6
Narine to bat at 5 and leave r/cricket in shambles,7
"Terrific stuff so far from Bish, not the commentator",7
Beautiful jesus,4
It’s hard to believe that this is Bishnoi’s first season. He was thrust in as the front line spinner of the team despite his inexperience but he’s really played well.,31
[deleted],9
Ffs they steal a single,4
"How hilarious would it be if Bishnoi started sledging Morgan and telling him *madarchod bat se maar*, ala U19 WC final, after every single delivery",10
Gill is emulating KL perfectly. Bilkul ricks nahi lene ka,14
is the bowling team more advantaged by having these two at the crease instead of getting a wicket,-1
Hope they stick with this team for a few games (except Maxwell),5
One of these two has to atleast up the ante.,4
Looks like we are not even scoring 100,5
Is  the wicket slow as hell or are we trash ?,6
"Kkr played last against csk, thala has infested in gill's mind",11
M Ashwin is better than Mujeeb,9
Why so many balls on gill s leg side?,2
9 overs 49/2 even in ODIs this is bad start. What is par score on this ground? 180?,1
Anyone else awake since 5 am(USA time) to watch this game?,5
That symbol for strategic timeout is so lame.,1
"Hear me out. In the auctions, the players can choose to play for whichever team has bid for them regardless of their bid being the highest or not. 

Honestly want guys like Gill, Vohra to be playing for Punjab and it might actually work out well for a lot of players. Ofc, still just an idea. Maybe with some tweaks it can be worked out",2
Good analysis by Lara,2
You can't just rotate strike when you are scoring @ below 6 in the 9th over. Intent had to be shown from both end.,6
TIL Kedar is actually a mutual fund,9

"Wickets in IPL are slowing down. By the playoffs, we could see really low scoring matches.",6
"Jhonty comes on the field for the pep talk, everybody leaves, but he still does it to keeper",5
I know Gill is playing slow but he is not the only one. His SR is better than Morgan who was supposed to be saviour no. 4.,4
"Good to see, Jonny and Warner back on orange cap top 5 list",2
At this rate if Russell doesn't fire we will not even reach 150.,1
What do you guys think about this trade: Markande to CSK and Hazlewood to RR. Markande has a much higher ceiling than Karn Sharma and Chawla isn't the same.,1
"With reference to the Kingfisher ad,

When did mujeeb become shit? Inform me before these things happen,11
Mujeeb seems out of form,9
Just want Morgan to fuck some shit up,8
Man Mujeeb has been underwhelming,9
Bish is damn good with his fielding too,6
Not that long ago 75 meters use to be normal six. Now 77 is huge.,2

Mujeeb be looking like a club bowler in comparison to bishnoi,4
This keeper is annoying than pant,6
Told you to hit to mid wicket!,4
"One would imagine one wouldn't find a keeper worse than Pant , but KXIP keeper is setting a benchmark here.",8

"Gill, time to show us your hitting.

I know you can hit sixes straight.",2
"Man, does anyone had a satisfying feeling when they fully stretch their one arm and a crack pops out.",9
Mujeeb bad,2
"Not going to comment on the levels of Simran's annoyance behind stumps, but atleast he's got a bigger range of vocabulary to mindlessly mutter, every now and then you'll hear some ""beauty""s, Pant just resorts to nonsensical ""ooooooeeeee""s and ""eaaaaaaaziee""",13
Difference between Bishnoi and Mujeeb: the latter is bowling a lot fuller.,8
"With KXIP's luck in the tournament, I am predicting a 60(25) from Russell.",16
"I love this KXIP keeper, it’s his job to keep the morale up on the ground. Who cares what he’s saying",17

"A bit confused by Morgan with that shot. No point trying to slog it against a bowler that you're struggling to simply lay bat to ball. Should've just rotated the strike, and gone after Mujeeb, or whoever is going ot ball next over.",6
Someone please cut off the stump mic,8
"Whenever this mofo says Bohot badiya, Mujeeb gets spanked",6

That Hero ad with ARR vocals was quite nice,0
No way Shekher Dhawan didn't know the meaning of one drop one hand.,5
Seriously impressed with Bishnoi this season. I hope he keeps this up and becomes a good FC spinner too. We need a good wrist spinner for tests.,5

Imma say it.. that car ugly,9
I think DK is single handedly responsible for Russel's sadness,7
I went down a rabbit hole watching 2016-2017 IPL highlights and saw a few of classic KKR games under Gambhir. Man. The whole vibe is so different now. The aggressive KKR of yesteryear.,10

How did that went for six!!,0
Maxi’s fielding is top notch,5

"When Punjab wins today, I will open the finest bottle of butter chicken that I have.",6
Maxwell's average should always be considered with a +5 to account for the number of runs he saved per match.,10

Mujeeb has been extremely village today. Bad day at the office for him.,5
My dude gill playing same shot for 14 overs!,2
Scenes if they send Narine over Russell,3
Thereby DK broke his no 6 hitting streak.,8
The keeper's not even saying actual words now. Just making random. guttural noises.,8
Ah so it's DK who we are bringing back to form today,6
Mujeeb having a tough day. Still will take it any day than the age-fudger Rashid,-5
Does Maxwell run from one end of the ground to the other between overs?,6
Jeez Mujeeb conceded 45,2
Who's a better fielder Maxwell or Rhodes?,1
This is a 160-170 wicket,3
"People on this sub when Gill does well: ""oMg hE sHouLD pLaY fOr InDIA.
When he is going at a run a ball in difficult conditions: ""Tuk tuk gill playing like Thala""",10
"What's gill doing here, he needs to get going or go back",0
[deleted],5
Cameraperson frantically looking for SRK.,4
That was beautiful,1
Bishnoi is so fucking good. God damn it. He gonna give Kuldeep another reason to cry,5
Shubman how can you do this when you are a Punjabi. Traitor 😡,4
By Sanjays logic it should be a big over alert not a wicket alert,1
Gill should be on that plane to Australia.,1
Bishnoi has been great under the radar,2
"7 overs 50 runs, pretty avg in T20",3
Gill after this match: Yeah strike rate overrated lmao,6
Lmao why even go upstairs.,7
Gill has the perfect temperament of all the young Batsman out there. Have high hopes on him for the future.,10
Take out Mujeeb and it's 10 overs 3-47,4
KKR ruined Kuldeeps career.,4
"Congratulations Gill for the 50. Well done. He held one end together, and scored at a brisk pace. Now go on a hitting mode.",9
Yo Gill warm that coolness a tad bit,3
People were asking SKY to hit or get out when he was batting well last match for Pollard. Now same for gill. Calm down peeps. We all know how SKY scored in last overs.,4
Lazy ass running,4
wtf Gill,7
Got lucky there. Careless running,3
Sunny G might get a stroke after watching that running!!,2
Top tier Sehwag running,5
SunnyG would've lost it if that was out,9
Abu Dhabi games are better to watch on TV than Sharjah games,3
Surely you have to try for 170 here.,5
"Another wrong'un, again short - got the treatment it deserved. Perhaps a coincidence but every third ball of Bishnoi's last two overs has been a wrong'un, on a same-ish length.",2
That could have been out. Shubham should not make simple mistakes like not grounding the bat,8
"Dravid trained these guys well, but he forgot to teach the lesson about grounding the bat. First Shaw, then Pant and now Gill smh",14
"Gill runs like Ganguly

I remember Saurav getting out like than in Australia",2
Wtf are they checking for lol. Check this but not that one run you take away for no reason.,5
Are we auditioning for Aussies test?,3
Lol Gill looks like a 90s wrestler with that hairdo and accessories.,5
"I think people really sleep on Shubhman Gill, he's not as talked about as Samson or Pant, but he's a good player himself, probably the future.",20
1 match old Arshdeep is our death bowler now ?,10
"I just tuned in, why is Maxwell still playing?? And is Mavi injured?",5
I'm scared for the 2 Chris Jordan overs,10
"Great innings by Gill. Steadied the ship after an early collapse. 

170+ on",10
DK either needs to hit or get out. It's time for russell to come in.,2
"Enter the final 5 overs, the phase KKr is waiting for",3
Predictions for last five? Imma say 77,3
Does Gill have a cross in one of his ears ? Harnessing the power of man who walked on water.,1
2 Jordan overs left add +45 to the score,5
Maxwell: Runs scored + Runs saved = decent average,16
"Gill 53(44)

Other batsmen 44(46) (4 of them combined)

r/cricket: Go home, Gill. You are making KKR lose.",43
Was that Rhea Chakraborty in the Altroz ad?,3
"I really hope Jordan doesn't bring Russel into form, KKR's next game is against us at Sarjah",3
Hoping for Arshdeep Vs Gill aggressive sledging in Panjabi,10
"With Dre Russ, Narine and Cummins coming in next if they start swinging the bat now 160 is possible.

Unlikely but possible",9
Everyone would be talking about Bishnoi if he played for literally any other team,23
"Arshdeep back with his Test match like  figures, 

will it be converted into T20 like ?:P",10
Man look at Arshdeep's bowling figures,6
Why are some of the players wearing full sleeves in this weather?,7
Wait what....arshdeep only went for 2 in 2 over!!!,11
Somebody should sacrifice themselves now to bring in the behemoth,11
"Lmao 3 wickets should have fallen by now, dugout, just give up",4
I think Punjab is the worst bowling side while MI is the best,2
I wish DK put on some pounds during lockdown so we could meme him as KarTHICC,9
r/Cricket - thanks for bringing DK back to form,18
DK Bose on the Abuse!,5
"Finally able to tune in to an IPL match, go KKR",7
"Morgan scores 24 off 23 : “oh dear oh gorgeous”

Karthik scores 16 off 10 : “you Fukin donkey”",98
Swann can coach SRK and KKR lol,6
Bowl Yorkers dude! You were pretty good in last match.,6
[deleted],4
KL captaincy is nuts. First he didn't give Mujeeb a break and now their best bowler would not be bowling in the death,6
"Gill really is just an accumulator, those SRs especially after facing that many balls are underwhelming, while Kohli hasn't been in the best of form recently, he still is a lot more proactive initially and maintains a 120+ SR until he changes gears amd starts accelerating, Gill seems to lack that game atleast for now",4
Don’t trust Simran got caught behind. Dude appeals at everything,8
Didn't sound right.,5
"I don't understand some players. 

Jordon is an amazing death bowler in all the other leagues except in the IPL. 

Finch, Morgan and Maxwell strike fear into other franchises in all the other leagues except the IPL. 

Feel free to add similar players. 

I am not talking about one hit wonders like tymal mills.",15
Haha Punjab death bowling goes brrrrr...,9
They are not taking the review to stop Russell from coming to bat,8
DK: Fuck you r/Cricket in particular.,27
"Dinesh ""Nidahas"" Karthik",32
Poor arshdeep lol,6
Arshdeep not bowling to the field that KL set?,5
So good to see DK doing this.,8
You go DK! This is your day!,9
"_sigh_ 

Karthik: fuck r/cricket",9
Hats off to KXIP for getting so many players back into form,7
Karthik fucking /r/cricket Arse Deep,13
Fantastic Karthik? Doesn't even rhyme,9
Man DK doesn't deserve all the hate he's getting,14
"Well, KXIP got DK back to form. Thenks.",11
Lol what’s with that DK chant,2
"DK to Russell: ""Yeh main karta hu, aap jaa ke Dream11 pe team banao""",8
That’s a wide lol,1
Bro what?,2
DK Bose DK Bose DK,4
That WK literally appeals for everything,4
Man they are really enjoying it in the dugout,3
Polite enquiry : why don’t we have more turbaned fast bowlers ?,1
That was a wide. Doesn't matter where DK was.,6
Arshdeep getting a pounding,7
Gill please go crazy now,7
Oh come on.,2
Pretty sure Swann is rich enough to buy that damn car with the tires,9
"Lol at everyone who said eoin morgan should be up the order and that dinesh ksrthik is shit. Not saying the opposite holds True, but just goes to show how little this sub knows",12
This bowler is called Ars(c)hdeep lol,3
Oh yassss KarThiccc let's go,5
r/cricket might have to wait for KKR’s next game against MI to get a chance to bash DK again,36
Of course DK back to form,9
Anything full or short is being punished. Bowlers should stick to their strengths and not try any variations.,8
DK redemption arc,6
Why not bowl Yorkers or even slower ones .....stop listening to *Nehra JI* and bowl length bowls.,7
Field placements are so shit,2
OMG Morrison shares the same intellect as us,2
Man went from Akram to Unadkat real quick,18
DK showing no major demons in the pitch,9
"Why don't they bring Russell in earlier, makes no sense . You can slog the 10th over just as easily as the 19th",0
The Dugout isn't the same without Deano but still prefer it for the chill,5
That's ma boi DK,4
Did Danny just say Aarshdeep as opposed to Arse-Deep?,5
"Lol DK scoring in a match 

Punjab bowling is definitely the worst",2
Fuck bruh,3
Greame Swann makes Danni Morrison sound normal.,3
At least DK is stepping up today. Not all is dull.,3
nobody gives a fuck about srk no offence,15
I think r/cricket bashing players works as a good luck charm for them....,4
SRK back from hangover,6
Nidahas yaad agaya DK ko,8
And r/Cricket has jinxed Arshdeep,10
Jordan in to open the taps,3
This is the perfect batting order for kkr. Even if they lose this one they shouldn't tinker with this order.,5
"I am once again telling you


Guru Randhawa iz the bezt singar 😎",0
Gill needs to start hitting man,5
"Shit not Jordan, not Jordan plzzz",2
Just tuning in. Mujeeb - oof.,3
Bengal Bangladesh it's all the same to DK,3
Is Punjab the 2017 RCB?,4
KXIP are still gonna lose aren't they? They've taken over RCB as meme team hahaha,6
[deleted],6
"It’s time fore DK to shine. Life hasn’t been good to him.

Got cucked (literally) by Old CSK opener.

Got cucked by Old CSK WK-Captain is his career.

Took his revenge and teabagged them with strategy last match. It’s only up from here.",10
SrK saving his fresh hair transplant from the elements,6
I feel they don't want to take a wicket and give Russell a chance to bat.,6
Nidhas Dk finally decides to make an appearance,4
"DK’s SR before trimming his beard : 109.09

DK’s SR since trimming his beard : 186.17",9
DK BABY,3
KKR needed captain playing well for team morale. So that's something I guess,2
Karthik striking at 200,5
"DK you beauty!!

Gill time to go big or go home.",4
Karthik is doing very well but I don't think he does well when he comes out too early. This is probably a good position for him.,7
DK with the sweet sweet SR of 200,9
I will never not hear that KKR chant as gay gay r,6
DK plays attractive shots when on song,10
Bruh whybdo we always do this shit,7
Maybe Kartik had issues seeing ball with that beard. Now he can see it like a football,12
Russell can be sad but Dinesh is doing a great job,7
Gill should go for every ball now. No point keeping Andre in the dugout,8
That was similar to Nidahas shot!,13
"""Fuck r/cricket"" Karthik probably",11
HOLY FUCK DK,2
DK Popa redemption,6
[deleted],6
Bruh....tf,3
R E D E M P T I O N,7
"Meh, Daytime bully",4
"DK clapping KXIP, never thought I'd say this",10
The Jordan we know is back,3
"I'm afraid DK is gonna take this as evidence that he should bat above Eoin. But in fact it shows the opposite because he's back to doing what he does best, coming in at the start of the second half of an innings, staying busy, and then hitting smart boundaries once he's in. He's a very smart finisher.",8
Holy shit that beard of his was truly cursed wasn't it?,3
Jordan the dead bowler.,6
DK fuck r/cricket,6
"DK is the best T20 finisher from India since 2018

Don't @ me",3
No beard Dk is chad AF,7
Its Nidahas time bitchess!!!,4
"Ah yes, the specialist death bowler",5
DK redemption arc,4
DK you beauty!,4
So that's why we don't see Jordan outside England,5
KXIP death bowling go brrrrr,6
Redemption complete,6
What a beautiful innings this is turning into from DK,6
Punjab is a different team after 15th over,9
Want Russell to enter now,5
DK: It's my turn today bitches,4
Jordan at death is such a buffet bowler,5
did we just reverse jinx DK again :))),8
DK seeing KXIP bowlers as Bangladesh bowlers now,10
Isn’t Jordan supposed to be a great death over bowler,10
Alright I'm convinced. Just drop Jordan. He's the most useless bowler of all time,12
DK doing a tewatia.,10
r/cricket in shambles seeing dk score,35
"My neighbour kid asked me to see if his fantasy team was okay since I know so much about cricket, I asked him to swap out Dinesh Karthik...",10
"Waited for this day to watch r/Cricket die watching DK in form, finally",20
Honestly wtf happens to our bowling in the last 5 overs.,5
Specialist death bowler ™,9
"Fk u dk, sly bastard waited me to remove him from my fantasy team",9
Nidahas mode activated,6
Thank you Kings for bringing DK back in form ☺️,15

Dafuq happend at timeout?,6
For fucks sake.,3

Oh how the Turn Tables,3
KXIP last 5 bowling is ridiculously bad.,4
CJ noooooo,3
DK back in form. Will it be Jadhav’s day too? /s,8
"It's so weird watching Jordan bowl like this at the death, he's been so poor in this IPL",11
KL Rahul following his mentor’s captainship ::)))),6
"Same old, same old.",7
How does r/cricket manage to be so wrong about literally everything,14
DK playing the inning so as the critics don't raise questions in the next 5 matches,2
"This is not the Jordan I remember, no control all of a sudden",1
"""kKr sHouLD dROp dK.. onLy nIDaHas pLayEr""",8

Who did Naagin 🐍 dance in the dressing room to charge up DK? 😒,5
"If I see ANYONE, ANYONE, EVER, say that Jordan is a great death bowler one more time, I'll personally come to your house and drop horse shit on the front door.",10
Gill needs to pickup pace,2
fuck yeah! go Karthik!. the beard was holding him back.,3
DKs body language seems like Hritihik from Koi mil gaya,4
If kedhar plays today and plays a match winning knock r/cricket will melt down,8
Well if Jordan is death over specialist then we need to search other definations for specialist,2
"Chris Jordan is just British Umesh Yadav. Gun fielder, not a bad hitter, always smiling on the field but tends to go for a few runs",11
"So beard was the problem, good for DK to figure it out quickly",7
"So, Jordan really performs shit in IPL. Drop him for good. Bring Ishan Porel.",3
Wakanda death bowler bowls no yorkers,5
"Can we just not bowl fucking yorkers, instead of length balls.",1
 just waiting for all DK memes today,8
Gill hasn'tgot strike since long,7
160 is a must for this to be competitive,5
Gill shouldnt take a single now,1
Nah he’s safe,1
"That looks out to me

edit: sike",1
Law of averages catching up with DK. One good show after many days.,10
Ya dk want that strike so badly,8
Attempt to suicide!!,1
DK 200iq trying to run out Gill,19
Finisher DK back at it,3
Another instance of r/cricket memeing a player into form,11
Safe all day,4
Sehwag wouldn't have dived.,7
"lmao, Pooran wearing 3 caps",6
The was a real good dive damn,6
What a fucking effort from my boy Gill!,2
Good guy Gill almost lost his wicket to give DK strike,9
Jordan the specialist death bowler.,3
How did he complete his 2nd? It looked out in real time replay.,3
"DK has been memeed back into form 
Well done r/cricket",10
"Wanted that to be out tbh, want a Russel storm now",8
CJ is allergic to bowling Yorkers in the IPL apparently,12
"Time to start ""Apologies, DK."" thread.",5
Couldn't help but stare at Gill's ass as he slid in,8
"Jist when I thought 2020 couldn't be any weirder, DK comes out all guns blazing. Wtf is happening?",1
Hat's off to the fitness level of DK and all other wicketkeepers. Gotta keep for 20 overs after batting in this heat,5
Seems like we can have at most either good death bowling or good power play bowling in a match,3
"I like this 3rd umpire, no unnecessary angles , just made the decision right away",1
They will be glad Gill didn't get out.,3
Imagine if Dhoni dived like that during that SF,5
How can the leg umpire even see anything at the crease from where he was standing?,1
"My man Karthik might not have had the international career everyone expected, but boy isn't he a domestic cricket legend.",3
Looks like DK needed the Sun to perform,3
JP Duminy's fetish seems to be the mirror image of Sunny G's 'left hander hitting a cover drive'.,1
I don't want to see Jordan ever play another game in the IPL again. No franchise deserves this level of shit bowling,4
KXIP will try to invent 15-15 format after this IPL.,7
Can get 160+ now hopefully,2
Somebody needs to keep track of all the players r/cricket has memed into form. It's Maxwell's turn next,9
"Man KXIP's Foreigners are ShIT AF. 

Mujeeb,Jordan, Maxwell all are shit",0
That a proper Chocobar dive. so satisfying to see no bobble of the bat,1
Holy fuck how did DK make 43 (19)????,5
"Chris Jordan is more like Chris Gayle , the difference only being he plays for the opposition",2
KXIP's ability of bringing players back to form > r/cricket meming them back to form,10
"Think this is KKR's best batting order tbh

Think they've finally got it right today

Obviously won't always come off but pretty much everyone is batting in the right spot

I know people want Russell up the order but I've always seen him at his best when he's coming in with 5 or so overs left in the innings",10
"SRK wanted to name the team KKKKR but mgmt convinced him to reduce 2 Ks.

Khan Ki Kolkata Knight Riders.

Instead of doing kkkk kiran he could now do kkkk r but had to settle for KK r",-4
"And, with DK coming into form, we now need only Russell to get some runs under his belt. After that, I won't have to worry about KKR's batting this season, barring the odd bad day",9
Does this mean we're gonna get mowed by Jadhav today?,10
"I guess, KXIP got full team of good players, but they don't want to perform for some reason. Maxwell, Neesham, Jordan, Cottrell.",6
They should have a small drone that can take the cap from the bowler at the beginning of the over and return it at the end,5
Good cricket all round,2
I’m loving KKR tearing KXIP apart here,7
What? What's Dhoni got to do here?,7
"They playing Arabian Dilbar Dilbar, nice.",5
When will Gill accelerate?,1
Bruh.  I fking hate Nehra philosophy of bowling length ball in death.,12
Karthik on the warpath. He has the bowlers frazzled with his wild movement before delivery.,7
DK and Gill fooling Punjab lol,4
Can we just play neesham who atleast knows how to bat and also concedes 40 runs anyways.,17
Just play normally DK -\_-,2
DK about to overtake gill any moment now,7
Omg I love DK now,5
Started with the Dhoni cocksucking again,2
r/cricket please shit on rcb bowlers so they do well in tonight's match,4
This batting order is what KKR should have played from game 1.,2
Our lord and saviour Dk 🙏🙏,5
Mr. Nidahas is back bois. Strap in,5
A player out of form suddenly plays a decent knock and then so many in this sub suddenly think the past criticism is somehow invalid now,8
Always rely on commentary to name drop dhoni when the situation has nothing to do with the situation,8
"KKR really don't feel like they've managed this innings well. 17 overs, only 133 on the board and Russell & Narine still in the dugout",1
DK protecting Gill xD,11
DK wants that strike. Responsibility 10/10,18
goddamn what a shot,6
"If you aren't going to use Maxwell's bowling, then why is he still in the starting xi. Play Gayle, move Mayank down to 3 and strengthen the batting.",4
Nidahas DK is here,7
BossDK has arrived,8
Fuck what a shot,10
What a shot,3
"DK about to overtake Gill

VJ & Sachin upset",3
Omg where was this Karthik all along!!!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼,6
Ok.... That's a great shot btw.,8

Excellent knock cap DK.,6
So proud of DK :'),3

I just wanna know who had a *talk* with DK?,5
Have to admit I had doubts about Karthik this year but this is impressive,5
Dk you beauty,2
People shitting on /r/cricket but don't ignore the fact that /r/cricket were right 5 times before the said player came good in the 6th game.,6

9D chess by DK to get Gill out to bring Russell in,10
Seppuku,2
For all his shambles so far this has been quality shotmaking and a much needed injection to the innings from DK.,8
The best and worst part about Karthik and Gill is that they don’t slog,7

"Dre Russ also out of form. Well, you know what's gonna happen.",8
Great innings from gill,5
KXIP will not be happy with Gill's wicket,5
Shaving his beard has done wonders for Karthik.,6
That languid batting style carries over to his running as well,1
R/cricket brought karthik back into form too lmao,6
Tactical run out by the best captain in the IPL,10
"Even in the Nidahas final, DK played his cameo on a slow pitch where all the other batsmen struggled. That is such an underappreciated aspect of his game.",12
It doesn't make sense to run out Gill and allow Russell to come in. I feel T20 cricket will evolve a lot in the next few years.,9
"Binga:""Do you wanna runout Shubhman Gill ?""

Absolute madlad",2
That's gill going for runs to compensate for the powerplay and giving Russ a chance,4
This is how 3rd umpiring should be done. Fast and furious,18

"**17.5** Mohammed Shami to Shubman Gill, 1 run, OUT, looks for the slog, Shami cramps him up, Gill is asked to run a second as this is the fifth ball of the over.

Now over to Russell and Karthik **145-4**

"Wow, arshdeep and Jordon Vs Russel. Gonna be fuuuunnnnn!!",3
"Damn, I wanted to see the sight of DK overtaking Shubman Gill.",3
Karthik and Russell will get out this over,4
Our next match is against RCB. Every year our fortunes change after meeting RCB.,6

Wrap Shami up in cotton wool please.,5
Tough task for Arsh. Dre Russ has all the license to swing here.,2
Russell will slaughter us now.,3
Russell gonna bully a kid,8
What's the par score here?,2
"Wow Arshdeep to Russell , didn't DK bash him last time",3
India don't have many clean hitters like DK. He's still got it.,8
"Arshadeep's test by fire this. Getting Russell here would add to his already rising stocks

Edit: wow! Lmao",6
"Bad balling. No third man
Edit: FUCCCC",2
binga has really been pronouncing it as Arsedeep this entire time,3
Russell has brought out his big guns,2
"DK don't perform well





Our bowling is crap 



*Pops bubble*",7
Arshdeep is going to take 1 wicket from this over,11
"This is absolutely shambolic field placement. If you want to bowl wide Yorkers, don't have third man up",3
Graeme Swann singing 🔥,9
"Ahh shit, here we go again",2
"Tbh I don't get why people play at those

He just about got 4 but could've easily been caught

If he left it it's a free run and an 'extra' ball",1

So unlucky. Story of our season,2
"lmao, DK doing something meaningful. Not bad",0
Lol lmao run out wasted,8
"Go King, good to see you taking big Russell's wicket. Well done",2
Russell weakness has been exposed this year,6
I called it! Lolllll,2
Unexpected!! Props to arshdeep.,8
What is Brendon mccullum writing?,6
Russel has been dogshit with the bat this season.,1
I don't think Russell is in mood this season with batting....,8
Wow Russell has been disappointing this IPL,14
The fuck,6
Lmao rip people who were saying Russell is going to cunt KXIP,12
Fml,7
Lmao Russel,6
I am absolutely shocked. Looks like we only bring one batsman back into form,8
I’m not saying dk is better all I’m saying is Dre Russ wouldn’t have gotten 53(23) at 5,31
There's an Arshdeep pun here but I'm not clever enough to find it,13
ARSHDEEP YOU MEGAFUCKER THAT WAS AWESOME.,16
Cummins instead of Narine? Lol,8
Russell is not even on form this season. Idk why everyone wanted Gill out for Rus,10
Russell hype train has derailed this season,11
"**18.2** Arshdeep Singh to Russell, OUT, Arshdeep has got the big wicket of Russell. That might be worth 10 runs **150-5**

AD Russell c &dagger;Prabhsimran Singh b Arshdeep Singh 5 (3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 166.66",2
Haha Gill's accumulation could have fetched more runs than this,7
"I'm shit at judging fielding placement, so I'm gonna ask you guys. How's KL at placing fielders? For some reason, I suspect he does a shit job.",2
RCB will get russell back to form,6
someone here made russel capn here yeah? hard luck,1
Arshdeep is Sikh Bumrah confirmed,4
Adding DK to the growing list of players r/cricket brought into form.,9
0.2 crore for Arsedeep & 3.0 crores for Jordan,7
"Finally simran can be happy, one successful catch behind wickets",6
Pretty sure Bazz and Nayar are prepping for UPSC.,6
Why is Russell playing like Chris Jordan ?,6
"That was anti-climax!!

Fire the IPL scriptwriters.",8
It's his weakness can't play wide ball. Should have been out on first ball.,3
Give Karthik strike you fuckers,2
Arshdeep deep into KKR tail.,6
I want Cummin vs ArseDeep,7
Russell's batting has been disastrous this season so far.,1
[Russell and Maxwell riiiiiiiiight at the bottom.](https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=13533;type=tournament),5
Its Russell the bowler this year y'all,6
"Arshdeep has been really good in the 2 or 3 matches he’s played so far, we should’ve been playing him from the start",2
The way Dre Russ is spoken about you would think he is in good form and provides for the team,2
"Russell needs to stop chasing those wide fucking yorkers. Just leave them be, you'll get an extra one after it.",2
Arshdeep is a promising bowler. Get him far away from KXIP,3
Arshdeep afraid of cumdog,5
That can't be not wide,3
Arshdeep is the new dhoni because arsh-deep?,0
Wtf is Josh® by Dailyhunt? Cringe tiktok clone?,7
Nehra has predicted 15+ runs in this over which means less than 15 runs will be scored.,6
What's up with the fake crowd chanting names now,4
Arshdeep beta woh ball pitch ke bahar gayi thi. Wide to banta hai,10
Russell has gone from a Superman to an average Joe. It feels like even I can get him out.,7
So what do we think? Will 165 be competitive here?,3
That's a no ball??,5
"dreruss should have just played a square cut, missed the show tonight",2
"Both Overseas bowlers have gone for runs in this match and people wanted overseas limit to be increased lol

Instead play with Indian talent like Ishaan Porel who will eventually come good.",11
Can someone plz explain why so many players are seen wearing 2 or even more caps this season??,3
So in that MG ad the dad took his foot off the brake with his daughter in the car as they were about to hit the tractor. 10/10 parenting,4
"Can we take a moment to appreciate this young lad Arshdeep? 

Bowls sick yorkers, gave breakthroughs last match and was extremely economical today early on.",24
"We have been shitting on DK all along , but Russell is out of form with his batting",27
Cummins has scored more runs than Russell at better SR in this IPL.,63
So wide lol,5
Wtf its no ball . how can the umpire not know the rules,7
"Russell, specialist death bowler.",22
Arsh'wide'deep Singh,11
Guys Russell is a full time bowler now,29
Gill died for this,11
"Are the Indian batsmen best at playing that chipping over covers shot? I have seen many doing it perfectly like Raina, Gambhir, Kohli and even DK today. This is a great shot to have to counter the wide ball yorker stuff.",7
"If Russell is collecting all of his power and strength just to cunt rcb in the next game, I'm ok with his failure",50
Dre's meds are weaning off.,7
Biobubble means Russel not getting the supply,15
Karthik took 2 runs instead of hogging up the strike.,4
"Will someone in KKR coaching staff talk to Russell and let him know that he is setting too high a standard for himself. You can be the God of hitting sixes but atleast take few balls, understand the surface, don't reach out for every ball. Build up his confidence, the shots will follow up naturally",9
Wut does Cummins have on his back?,3
DK has more belief in Cummins than Gill xD,35
Karthik didn't take a single with Krunal at the other end against NZ but he trusts Cummins enough to take a double lol,11
"Lmao commentator saying that first wide was harsh, the ball didn’t even land on the pitch it was that wide",5
So we’re looking at about 30 runs from Jordan’s last over bois?,6
Whenever I see a Bollywood celeb I only see drugs and narcotics. News channels have fucked with my mind.,14
 Nehra is an annoying commentator,5
Cummins Arshdeep,10
Dugout™️. More game per game.,1
170 looks a good score on this pitch today,3
Styris and Lee are why I primarily watch Dugout. Still missing Deano.,10
"There's no winning with people at what position DreRuss comes in, the match situation is not going to be perfect every single time for him to come in, if he's getting 3 overs to work with then he has to adapt and get on with it.",33
switch hit him,2
Could it have been possible for him to ball at the stumps for that (edit: second) last ball? Or did the batsman anticipate the wide?,5
Fantastic execution from Arshdeep,10
Arshdeep you madlad!,5
This dude is bowling wides,2
Arshdeep take a bow!! 👏,6
Sometimes Harsha goes too far with his romanticization of the game. Two international players putting pressure on a youngster...come on now,3
"Well in, lad",5
Arshdeep can unclench now. What a spell from young sardar.,3
"I rate Arshdeep

Been very good since he came in, looks to have a good temperament as well",5
Man Arsh is GOOOOD.,4
You are a gem Arsh. 👌👌👌,4
Arshdeep Singh is a FAR better bowler than Saini imo,-4
"KKR is a very balanced team this time. Not dependent on anyone, unlike last year.",4
Great job,1
Imagine calling for more overseas players instead of watching young Indian talent like this shine,7
"now every bowler is going to start bowling wides

batsmen will need to switch hit them",4
2 left arm youngsters Arsh and Natrajan have shown better temperament than experienced Khaleel till now,7
Arshdeep has been seriously impressive in the last two matches. He has mostly bowled in difficult positions so it's great to see him do well.,6
Lord Jordan on his way to +25,5
well bowled Arshdeep bro,1
[deleted],6
Feels good to see an Indian left arm pacer do well. Well played Arshdeep!,8
KKR squandered the chance to make 180+,0
Love it from Arshdeep especially his confidence in sticking to his plans. Had only one plan and executed it every ball despite going for two wides.,8
CJ with the last over oh lord I cant bear to watch,3
We have found 2 left arm pacers in Natarajan and Arshadeep. Hopefully they don't take the Khaleel or Barinder Sran route,11
I am confident that Jordan has forgotten how to bowl good length balls,5
"Kl just wear one cap buddy, no one gonna doubt your loyalty towards Punjab. You deserve orange cap wear it proudly",4
"That was a phenomenal over. Had Russ, and free flowing Karthik to deal with when KKR had all the momentum. But just 8 runs, and the wicket of Russ. Nailed almost all of his yorkers, and bowled to his strength, and field.",10
Good over by Widedeep Singh,3
45 dot balls fuck.,2
"KKR sends Russell early so gets to face more balls : OMG why are they doing that's not what he's good at

KKR sends Russell late : OMG give him more balls why are you sending him late . 


Lose-lose situation",44
Whose idea was Jordan in last over lmao,1
Well looks like we got the sole good bowler in Punjab lol,3
I don't want to see Jordan bowl for us again. Better bring Porel in,2
Bowl Maxwell last,1
at least 24 from this,1
"Coms: *OOOOO what an over from the young man, very well bowled*

<wide 4 wide W, 0WD, 0WD, 2, 1, wide dot, wide dot>",0
Lolol bowling short with fielders inside the circle,2
Chris ‘Umesh Yadav’ Jordan,2
"Do KKR not have a social media presence? I see tweets and YouTube videos from other teams all the time on this sub, but I don't ever recall seeing anything from KKR.",3
"Jordan bowling wide, with third man up...what a death bowling specialist",3
Jordan has the arsenal but he's not bowling with a clear mind.,3
"IPL is good  for young players who have missed the U19 Bus. 

Bumrah, Hardik",7
Why is Mavi out? Injured?,3
Jordan is soooooo baaaaaad man,0
"Even if 160+ is a low total, kkr did amazing here.",9
Incoming punch over cover,3
Horrible bowling.  Overseas bowlers have sold Kings XI down the river this season so far.,18
DK coming to form will transform KKR like crazy,10
"Isn’t Jordan a highly praised English t20 bowler?

He is playing like a club bowler in ipl...typical medium pace right into the bat",9
"When people find names like Mandeep, Arshdeep etc. funny, I find it extremely disrespectful because their names have such a beautiful meaning. Mandeep means lamp of the mind and Arshdeep means light of the universe.",49
Is that Gayle I'm seeing!!,2
Man’s bowling almost all the balls in the slot like wtf,1
Wtf was that Punjab Punjab,2
Has Jordan forgotten that he doesn't play for rcb anymore?,5
"Shit bowling, good fielding.",2
I would pay for only fans of DK 🍑☺️🥵🥵🥵,5
Why don't they play Hardus Viljoen instead of CJ?,7
"Seen a few people call Natarajan ""young"" , just a fyi he's 29 years old",17
Pointless poll that was. Russell's batting is far more important than his bowling.,11
"Jordan: How to bowl with out getting hit
ARSHDEEP: just bowl WIDES",2
"Jordan needs a good captain i think to tell him where to bowl. Not to shit on KL, but Morgan we see does have a constant talk with bowlers when bowling at death, so may be...",7
"C'mon DK, one more boundary.",2
McCullum writing whole essays about players lmao,14
The first one he's landed where he should,3
That Wicket Keeper thinks everything is a wicket,10
"Damn, didn't know Arshdeep was also in the 2018 U19 WC squad",11
Jordan showing what he's all about. They should keep him for the next game too.,9
How did Jordan manage to infiltrate the Good Death Bowlers Club?,9
Small redemption arc this over,17
Punjab gave only 50 runs in last 4? Damn,8
Good bowling in the end by KXIP standards,9
"Eoin Morgan will be pleased

Karthik sacrificing his wicket to try get an extra run",10
DK finally came to the party,5
"Wait, did we not concede 30 runs in a Jordan over, there might be hope in this match after all",4
We are screwed if we don't get at least 2 wickets in the 1st 6,3
Who the fuck asked for third umpire for that,8
sack this pathetic blind umpire,7
3 run outs in a single innings* lol,2
"For all the shit people were saying about Jordan, his last over only went for 7 lmao",5
Morgan happy looking at DK not playing for average.,7
Omg that's a Out! Phew important review.,6
"Good guy DK doesn't give a fuck about his average

Anti-Thala",42
Par score,3
Pathetic of umpire to send that upstairs,8
I think both teams will be happy with the ending. KKR end up with more than what they should have and Punjab pulling things back in the last couple of overs.,6
I like this 3rd Umpire. He should be a regular fixture from now onwards.,11
DK with average of 9 looked like a clown captain. This innings will make him feel secure about his own skills and allow him to captain more confidently.,11
HOw the fuck do they need 3rd Umpire for this too,7
Shit on-field umpires. Can't even give a simple decision,7
Love this no “rock and roll” BS 3rd umpire,14
McCullum filing his Income Tax returns,10
[deleted],2
"DK has a weak ass jawline

Should've kept the beard",1
"Well that was out with the naked eye, lazy ass on field umpire",8
"If Jordan can keep his trade going and with Arshdeep coming real good at the death in two consecutive matches KXIP are starting to solve their death troubles.

Now to arrest their batting form's downward spiral",7
"There is no way KKR winning this 

160 is too low of a score against Punjab batting",5
I think we bowled kinda well today considering we broke some 35 over wicketless drought in the last match,7
Man. Why even have square umpires at this point?,8
"Videocon has been super generous today it seems, been ""previewing"" Select HD since the 9th over, it's still going on!",4
Why the fucky angles for run out instead of the side on view?,3
That square leg umpire is in a competition for the 'nothing to do in my job' award,8
Love it when the last ball has been bowled but a Hostar comment says today kkr will make 240,7
"Tbh if at the end of the powerplay you told me that KKR will go on to make 164, I would have been very happy. I'm sure KKR can pull this back with their bowling.",11
"**19.6** Jordan to Karthik, 1 run, OUT, short, quick, into the body, Karthik hits this straight to deep square, and for a change someone takes the second off the last ball even though it is not on. Karthik is run out, but this is a sight for sore eyes **164-6**

KD Karthik run out (Pooran/&dagger;Prabhsimran Singh) 58 (29b 8x4 2x6) SR: 200.00",3
"If Punjab don't win this, they deserve to finish last. Bowlers have finally stepped up. Now to the batsman.",12
hella fight back by kxip,3
Run out looks funny from that angle,1
Happy with this score after being at 75/3 after 13 overs.,3
"Jordan this season - 0 for 135 at economy of 12.3

Ouch!",14
Jordan frequently displays moments of excellence. He just needs yo be more consistent.,10
I don't think on field umpires even bother with run out decisions now. Apart from the brain fades like the Rana one.,11
Come on KXIP have to be able to chase this.,3
Oooo Jordan did amazing lash over,2
Shubman batting is tailor made for chasing this sort of score. Unfortunately his team was batting first.,16
What's up with Mavi liking wildly problematic tweets?,8
"DK, where were you all these days?",4
KKRs game.,3
Decent score! Russell needs to improve the batting this season.,3
DK had to work overtime to undo the damage done by Gill and Morgan,7
Advantage kxip. Kkr should have scored more against arguably the worst bowling lineup in the tournament,4
Better from Jordan. I think mujeeb seems to be figured out though. Neesh needs to play next game,8
DK did a complete 180 on this sub.,9
Why do they need a DJ and announcer for an empty stadium?,9
"How cold is it in Abu Dhabi right now?
Shahrukh Khan is wearing a wintercap and a jumper. The players must be freezing on the field.",11
"Karthik is anti-Dhoni; scores runs fast, and doesn't care about staying not out at the end.",24
Abhishek nayar competing with Brendon mccullum. Who scribbles the most?,8
"The plan was to “keep it simple” / “play my natural game” 

Like wtf does that even mean?? Hate when players say that",9
Good interview by arshdeep,2
165 target? KKR would take that any day of the week,9
"If Mayank gets out early, I kind of expect KXIP to bungle the chase.",10
"As much as I adore Nehra ji, he speaks a lot of nonsense.",6
Arshdeep was excellent,4
[deleted],6
Arshdeep and Bishnoi have been superb for the past two matches. Nice to see,10
"20 runs short I reckon. I'm not confident we can defend this, especially with Mavi out of the side.",2
"DK should get bonus points for sacrificing his wicket on the last ball of the inning, wholesome performance.",15
"If KXIP can't chase it, just disband the team mid-tournament.",11

"Can I just please get a good innings from Mayank today, he’s the only one apart from Pooran in this batting line-up that’s enjoyable to watch",2

Mine is KXIP wins this. I know it is bold.",5
"Someone just said DK is great against minnows, be it Bangla boys or Bhangra boys. Lmao",22

Why is Gayle not playing?,5
Was Gayle unwell? I assumed he would slot in for Maxwell.,3

Has he done his shoulder there? I hope not,1
LoL. That's all.,1
What a flop this guy!,2
Come on russell you can't be serious,3
Prasidh thought it’s a six,1
Bowler was like fucking hell you could have caught it and then got injured,4
I didnt really notice but did anyone see how much Arshdeep was clocking in at?,2
Srk favor to preity?,2
Strategic drop by Russel?,11
You don't need an apology thread every time a player does well after being shit for a while 🤦🏾‍♂️,5
"Dropped catch, four runs conceded and injury!

Ouch!! That most have hurt😅",4
KL SR Watch: 85,7
:(,2
Russel injury #473,3
"Last time we saw a team chasing 165 odd, they ended in a position of needing 78 runs from 4 overs with 7 wickets in hand.",2
"If KXIP bottles this, they should relegate to play Mushtaq Ali trophy.",2
Russell was an athletic man. Not anymore. Has gained too much muscle to move freely now.,7
Last time when KL was dropped he scored 132* this season,8
Hope he's okay. He's worth way more than 4 runs,6
KL SR watch: 78,3
What's with these guys changing bats in the second over?,4
"That's okay, Russ. Not everybody is Hardik Pandya",5
Ball’s holding up everywhere except Russell’s hands,6
Bruh Rahul is done for. His confidence is well below 0,6
"Talk about a triple whammy. A dropped catch, that then goes to boundary, and the star player who dropped the catch might be injured in the process.",6
"Russell seems to be not taking this IPL seriously. The way he batted and now this catch, he might not be playing again for KKR next auction.",5
Why do so many players get injured moments after dropping a catch?,3
morgan in a floppy hat! cute,3
"russel didn't get his dosages this year I guess,looks unfit as well.",3
"Prasidh is tall, quick, and can get quite a bit of movement from what I've seen watching him play Ranji on Hotstar. Looking forward to seeing how he develops.",9
"I don't know, this drop of the catch and the accident look like bad acting to me.",2
"If Russell is injured, KKR is fucked",4

Why does it feel like everytime Russell dives he gets injured? Too bulked up imo,7
Would love to see a good knock from Rahul and Mayank,4
Mandeep should come at 3 today. He played a good cameo of 30 couple of innings ago and was unceremoniously dropped to 6 against SRH.,12
Feel so bad for prasidh. Should have been 1 run for 1 wicket,12
Don’t think it’s possible for that attempted catch to have gone any worse for Dre Russ,8
Good for KKR i guess from a neutral's POV he was just giving them some overs at the death but nothing much apart from it,5
I swear r/Cricket is gonna meme KL Rahul strike rate into form.,11
"Boys, which team has the biggest chance to choke away their chance at playoffs despite starting well ?",3

KL SR watch: 80,4
"If Russell's injury is serious, we might get to see Banton this season",6
Looks like Kings XI are again repeating the same mistakes. Playing too slow at the start and making it harder for everyone who follows.,11

The same reason why Pant and Pandya are virtually undroppable because they are the best for 5 and 6 and nobody so far in IPL made a case for themselves except possibly Tewatia. A trio like Yuvraj, Dhoni and Raina of 2011 WC still looks like a dream for 2023.",16

Should've cunted him that over. Rana was bowling short pies,3
"I know kxip has this in bag but doesn't they need something to do for the run rate as well ??

If not today then when ?",3
Someone needs to pull off a Thala and win it for KKR,3
Lol who TF is that 😂: ek acha over,4
who was that saying ek acha over T: one good over,3
Couple of wickets in the last two overs and KXIP could still get stuck here,7
"What exactly is the point of Russell now? He causes far more trouble than it's worth. Last year he performed brilliantly in few innings and then went ahead and caused a tussle in the entire team with his ego.

The guy has a ego which is as brittle as his fitness.",15
KKR clearly missing their specialized bowler Lord Russell,6
Does KXIP have legit good fielding or did KKR pull an Inzi?,5
Any news about mid season transfers yet?,2
Pooran would have hit Rana for 30,3
Has anyone noticed these cricketers have stopped eating bananas during break?,6
Bad shot,3
"unpopular opinion..

while deciding on who gets the orange cap they should consider no. of runs scored and SR..

similarly for purple cap they should consider no. of wickets taken and economy..

both SR and economy should get some weightage..",2
Send Maxwell for Big Show,5
Koach too cool for Dream 11 ads?,11
Bruh,7
Punjab 155/4 after 20 overs,5

just took a quick nap and came back to see not a single wicket taken yet... as soon as I sat down on my chair mayank got out lol,8
Yo nothing is off alright it looks buried but if Pooran gets out and Maxi still got no clue shit could go down,3
mccullum and nayar look like those indian idol audition judges with all that set-up.,5
Kl be like my orange cap is safe for now,10
I'm gonna eat Maggi without Masala again if KXIP bottle it.,4
"What notes are they even taking, even when the opposite team player hits a delivery straight to the fielder",5
Good new let pooran do the rest,3
"The commentator just said this is gonna be a game changer, they've already won it",10
They've got to send in Pooran now,5
It was all pressure due to Rana's over,8
2 Karnataka boys batting and karnataka lad bowling. And rcb isn't playing for another hour!,8

Karnataka bowler to Karnataka batsmen,1
Does Pooran have Indian roots?,4
"Rahul

U have ensured orange cap for yet another day

Now u shud get going too",2
We want Maxwell,3
Did KL give up keeping just so he can wear the orange cap all the time while on the field?,11
Now this is interesting,2
Lmao Dhoni looking like a proper unkill,-1
Well Player 🐐 Mayank !,3
"How does Karnataka contribute so many players to the IPL?! Prasidh, Gopal, Gowtham being the less prominent ones",10
Why not maxi :(,-2
"2 quick wickets 

N we might just pull this off",3
Pooran against Narine will be the matchup to watch,5
KXIP already lost two matches they should have won. That should give some confidence to KKR.,9
"KKR coaching staff seems to go Andy flower route of believe in data and workout a plan, but these days isn't there something better way to capture .

Are they pulling a CSK here?",1
Scenes if Pooran doesn't score a 32(8) *,0
Really irks me when Harsha is the one mispronouncing words. Slyver of hope smh.,2
Bring in narine fuckers,1
Baz and Nayar just teenage backbenchers drawing a set of tits,8
"Even if KL wants to be the anchor, he can play at the rate Mayank did today. Not really an issue even if you’re playing proper shots. At least hit at 130-140",3

Kxip plsss dont bottle this chase,3
"Kxip is winning this ,there is no way they can lose it

Bowling so may overs of spin in the death is eventually going to bite KKR in the ass.,4
KXIP taking this match unnecessarily close even after dominating opening partnership. 2 overs out of 5 will be bowled by Narine.,2
Waiting for Narine to Pooran,2
I'm having a very bad feeling that we're gonna bottle this tooo,5
These commentators are mad or what. Talking about NRR when we can still bottle it from here,5
that KL hologram looks like its own statue of liberty in middle of the stadium.,3
"Required rate is manageable, kxip could have sent Maxwell up early to get him back in form.

Pooran already striking well, if Maxwell can join the party it would be good for later stages.

P.S. Since they keep selecting Maxwell I feel he in part of their scheme for long term this season hence the suggestion.",4
Super thoughts incoming!,3
KKRs form is so patchy. Really stressful as a supporter,13
"Fuck

R they gonna give the last over to spinners",6
Shot!!,3
KL SR watch: 130,2
Well played Dk,5
That's just bad bowling,8

"No matter what you change with field, bowling at the slot is not going to help",1
What is Mavi not playing today? Injury?,4
"KL looks at line up after Pooran 





*Fine I'll do it myself*",6
Kkr bowling is actually toothless,4
Can't allow those easy runs ffs,6
Friendly remainder that Narine still left with 2.,5
This dil chahta hai look is bringing positive vibes to dk.,7
How the fuck they can be at bottom with top two leading run scorers...... Is it the bowling or KL has been selfish,2
"KXIP 2018 vs 2020. If they win their nth match in 2018, they lose it in 2020, and vice versa. Basically,

2018 - WLWWWW

2020 - LWLLLL

Fun fact, their 2nd game in both 2018 and 2020 was vs RCB.

If the pattern continues, KXIP will win 7 of their last 8 games and qualify. The only game they'll lose will be their 9th game (against MI next Sunday) coz the only game they won in 2018 was their 9th game (vs RR)",8
Either KL Rahul is selfish or doesn't trust his team's middle order to do the job. Why isn't he accelerating to win this comfortably and secure good NRR,8
"What's the fucking point of Fairplay awards, I don't think even winners care that much.",8

Nice shottt!!!!,1
Should have gone for the kill with Narine,2

Is Pooran the captain of the Westindies side yet?,0
Robin Singh should come in to bat next.,3
KXIP doesn't deserve Pooran,0
"This is buffet bowling. 

All you can eat for $9.99",6

Kartik Tyagi does a better job than Sheldon Cottrell. Thats why teams need better scouts,2
POORAN 😍,1
"35 in 25, easy peasy",3
Fucking love Pooran,9
Not sure if Nagortkoti or Umesh Yadav?,-1

Pooran simply collecting freebies,2
[deleted],3
"Nargoti learning you can't bowl half pitch crap at overseas batsmen, even if they look Indian",15
This should be easy,1
Game over.,1
These 2 are literally the most stylish batsmen in world cricket.,1
I have a quesion which might be seem stupid. How do IPL teams earn their money? The winner just gets around 20 crore while RCB pay 27 crores alone to Kohli+ABD.,2
KKR threw away whatever chance they had,6
Change has to come from within. Dhoni took this quote seriously.,8
Nagortkoti looks 12. Very mean of Pooran to hit the 12yr old like that,7
"KKR need to bring in Lockie Ferguson in place of Cummins. You can't hide your premium, foreign fast bowler in the first 10 overs, and expect inexperienced Indian bowlers to curtail runs at the back end of the inning. It's not as if Cummins is taking a lot of wickets either.",3
Even pooran wants csk vs rcb to start asap.,8
Finally KXIP getting one,1
[deleted],10
"Kkr need to try with Lokie Ferguson as a wicket taking bowler in powerplay   
This is a very inexperienced bowling,  no yorkers or bouncers",6
Fair play to Pooran for coming back from the pair in the first match,6
Pooran in this kind of form is deadly. Kumble better be making plays to get in a bankable bowler in the midtransfer to bolster these guys up.,10
"So, it's over. Next match with RCB in Sharjah. It's gonna be a bat vs bat battle.
Both team have only 1-2 good bowlers at best.",3
CEAT Tire strategic timeout is like youtube ads. It will make anyone want to buy their products even less.,5
"Unless Nagarkotti develops the ability to bowl yorkers at the death, he will disappear from the scene in two or three years",6
"If Pooran was born in India, he definitely would've been competing with Pant, Kishan, and Samson for that keeper spot.",5
Kings need 29 in 24 balls with 9 wickets innhand yet win probability is KKR 57% kings 44%,11
[deleted],1
"Could have used the spinners over before giving Nagakoti another over, poor move",3
Pooran please finish it in two overs 😍,5
Mayank & Rahul are the Warner & Bairstow of this IPL,2
KL should play the last 4 overs with 80 SR to show all the critics that strike rate doesn't matter in T20s.,10
"Anybody here who have avon cycle, how is it compared to montra,and firefox",6
RCB won the toss and chose to bat first. Dhoni: Even the coins hate me.,8

"Excuse me Bish, RCB is decorated? How exactly?!",4
"Mayank and Rahul should become permanent openers for India in Tests, they're ready",5
Man Punjab batting in a different pitch,9
I remember watching an ODI in the 90s when 28 off 23 would be a super tense situation favoring the bowling side. Now it seems like a doddle.,10
Okay guys this game is done. head to the meme match of the year.,8
kumble with palpatine smile.,8
"Hey, do you think the Altroz is the gold standard?",3
"Altroz is definitely not the safest car in the world Sanjay, calm down.",8

Economy Rate of 8.36 bowling almost exclusively in the first 10 overs.",10
" chill out bongs. you still have a chance, You're playing against us after all",10
Pooran is in no mood to BS around. He wants to wrap it up,11
Hope Jadhav doesn't play today.. wait a minute.. wrong thread.. Declare KXIP winners already..,5
CSK yet to bat first in 7 games. Don't remember something like that happening before,10
Rcb batting boys.morris makes his debut in ipl 2020,9

"Bruh CSK dropped Jadhav for Jagadeeshan, never thought this would happen",6
"Gill seems he had the fitness of Kohli but his running between the wickets and ground fielding is nowhere near him. Same with Dube, most unathletic fit person I have ever seen.",8
Kolhi winning the toss AND chosing to bat first?! 2020 is full of surprises..,8
Narine vs Pooran,2
"2 points is what's key than NRR Right now, they had hit rock bottom already",3

What if 3 wickets fall and Bishnoi has to quickly change out of those shorts?,13
Jaggi debuts,3
Pooran vs Narine,3
Kedar out for CSK,7
No kedar = no memes :(,4
"Kolkata's ""exciting young pace battery"" has not been able to get us through today.


Cummo is not picking many wickets as you'd expect from a premier bowler like him. This is where the top 2 (even RR) have done much better .",4
These clowns always choke,6
"Welp, here we go",7
Lol,4
Wasn't it narine who bowled a maiden super over against pooran in cpl ?,7
Jagdeeshan is getting a game kedar out,4
A twist in the tale?,2
If you bowled Narine over Nagarkoti this could have been close,3
Should have bowled him instead of Nagarkoti everyone knows Pooran has been poor against him.,3
Are we gunning for a moral victory here?,3
Narine to Pooran: baap baap hota h beta beta hota h.,4
You don’t expose stumps to narain,3
Silly and stupid,3
Oh man. Why.,3
Why has Narine lost his edge?,3
Choke begins?,4
"Yeah, that wasn't really necessary",3
Bruh no way,1
Maiden super over flashbacks for pooran against narine,3
Kxip back in its original form,3
I swear to god if maxwell pulls a jadav,2
Ok. Take KL out and we got a stew going 😈,3
Pooran still don't know how to score against Narine Lmao,2
Bottlejob incoming,5
Haha,2
[deleted],19
Still no maxwell 🤦‍♂️,2
Super mature innings from kL,5
Pooran becomes a tailender against Narine,2
Which of the three Cred ads is the best? For me it's the Bappi Lahri one,3
"**17.2** Narine to Pooran, OUT, oh Pooran. What is he doing here? **144-2**

"Pooran gone. Hope Maxi doesn't do a Jadhav here, I'd feel really bad for Rahul and Mayank who set this chase up so nicely",5
Will Rahul still wait till the last moment to do the honors?,6
This franchise should be liquidated if they choke yet another time,19
dadas eyebrows have more movement than the ball during the match.,6
"I feel bad for the Star Sports presenters who were all set to hype the Kohli vs Dhoni battle up, but gotta wait till KXIP finishes this",7
Love that song,2
Prabhsimran is that guy who will impress everyone in net sessions and give average performance in actual match.,2
"KKR had a poor planning and execution today. DK batted well, Gill was slightly underpar (considering how Mayank played), and bowling/fielding was poor.",5
Just now in Chris Morris will play 🥳,5
No one can underestimate KXIP middle order.,7
PTSD shot from pooran,7
He looks like a Punjabi Rashid Khan,5
Send Mujeeb out to bat you cowards,7
Rahul now has to do it. What’s the point of batting till the end if he can’t now?,1
Not Maxwell ?? Surprised,3
Why did they not send Mandeep or Maxwell,6
Cmon Punjab don't bottle this,1
I'm calling a choke here from KXIP,16
Someone dismiss Rahul dude!,2
"KXIP fans : Ah fuck here we go again

CSK : first time?",10
"Why not ask Maxi to come and smash it, whatever happens",4
They bottling this I'm feeling it,6
"So you are telling me if rcb and KKR loose today srh will be an actual number 3 in the tourney?

We were in last place only  a weak ago",7
Prabh doing a Jadhav,3
"If any team can find a way to lose this match from this point, it's ~~SRH~~ ~~RCB~~ KXIP",8
Everybody on the field should shout the hell out,3
"I love how careful the commentators have been constantly adding ""But they still gotta cross the line!"".

I guess they can't be trusted after 1 off 3.",3
Good test match audition for Simran,7
It almost definitely won't happen but imagine KXIP bottle this,4
"Surely KXIP can’t botch this, right? right??",9
Bc what are you doing,4
Omg missed a dolly!,2
Lmao this match went 0 to 100 real quick,7
Guys....superover?,4
"Why play Maxwell if you don't send him in such situation, putting pressure on some young guy",6
Here we go haha,2
Why is the anti climax turning into a climax....,9
Prabhsimdar Sindhav,7
KL is just too good a batsman to bottle it up from here,5
Tactical single,3
Narine bowling alone is enough for him to be an automatic pick for Kkr even if his batting is figured out,5
"Lol they don't even trust maxwell to chase 21(16), why even play him?",5
So many comments of Chris Morris playing by RCB fans....you know that you are RCB fans right ? Don't jinx it man.,3
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡,3
"Jadhav - front foot defense

Simran - back foot defense

Nais",4
Bro..come on....for the love of God just win...,3
Jadhav intensifies,2
"Lmao, MF played a wide after wasting 3 balls",3
If only KKR was at the top of points table like that fairplay shit.,6
"Good single to give away tbh

Keeps the inexperienced new batsman on strike",3
I’ve seen this script before,8
Don't do what CSK did the other day..@KXIP,5
Rahul will go for the kill in 19th over and get out,3
"Nobody should lose from here..

Kxip - hold my lassi.",9
Prabh on strike smh,4
Kumble sucks. Why would you send Simran here?,9
death bowler narine™©,9
If Russell was fit KKR would have been favorites,5
What an over,5
*3 dot balls away*,3
"Wtf, just 2",7
wtf is this... why is maxwell in the team!,7
This is far from over. Trust Punjab's middle order.,6
You can’t send in a newcomer in a chase. Send in an experienced guy. I don’t blame Prabhsimran,10
"Nah, KXIP can't bottle this shit. This can't happen",7
"If they lose from here I swear I'll delete my account.

Save this comment",38
"Please!! It will be hard to watch.

Win this one KXIP.",7
Feel like shit just want international cricket back,18
"What Pollard is to MI, Narine is to KKR. Legendary.",9
Man the youngsters are put under the hammer here,4
KXIP are the team 2020 deserves lmao,13
Why you gotta play with my anxiety bro.,5
We had in form Mandy. Why kxip WHY?!?!?,5
Russell missing big time,3
"Kumble got it wrong here, what is the point of sending an under pressure youngster at this stage ahead of maxi and mandeep.",12
"Bruh as a loyal kxip fan , if they lose this one just liquidate it yr",9
Should have given this one to Rana?,2
"Please please, get the chuck of runs this over",4
"KL Rahul was set, Pooran was new. It's a known fact that the set batsmen should attack and new batsman should rotate strike.",7
It’s still Punjab’s game to lose by a long way,8
KL is confusing lethargy with responsibility.,5
"Nice ... Prabhsimran keeping strike so he can unleash based on being the set batsma... wait, what? Why?",1
Just give the strike to KL you fat fuck don't bottle this one aaaaahahhh,0
Another choke job incoming.,4
it looks like kumble sent him because he was in his dream 11 lineup.,11
Newcomers aren't a bad choice in such times. They have little to fear and often don't have bad history or the weight of past expectations.,2
Prasidh is a looker 🔥,2
"Matter can never be destroyed. But when it matters, it transforms from dropped Jadhav to newcomer Prabhsimran",2
"If we bottle this, Kumble deserved the koach treatment

Why would you send a 20yo against Narine when you have two experienced explosive options on bench",10
I will never understand why a new batsman takes two dot balls when there are 8 wickets in hand and they need to score 9 an over.,3
Morgan will hopefully just slow the game down here a bit with some direction and chat,2
"I thought the DC game was the worst way to lose for KXIP, they might outdo themselves here",6
"OK. A man can only dream. But, think what happens if KL gets out in this ball!",3
Imagine if KXIP lose with something like 7 wickets in hand,9
It almost looks like we're seeing 2012 Narine. Gambhir used him so well in the death overs.,2
Since when did Krishna bowl at 144 clicks. Damn!,5
Nagarkoti 0-40 in 3. Why hasn't Russell bwoled?,3
That Nagarkotti over for 19 runs really hurt now.,7
Punjab still could lose this,4
KXIP finding new ways to lose a game,6
Another terrible innings from Rahul to even put them in this situation,5
KL vs Narine in the final over. Get your popcorns ready!,4
Oh Punjab pls don't bottle this,3
Punjab will get fucked if no boundaries this over.,5
What's Maxwell getting paid for ?,3

Bhaag Simran Bhaag,9
"kumble removed his shades,you know what that means.",8
Anything above 8-10 runs is going to be tough vs Narine :|,4
"Nagarkoti to bowl the last over, oh my.",7
Lmaooooooooo,2
Kings will lose and KL's stupid slow batting which has been going all season is to blame a lot.,3
How has Narine become this monstrous death bowler from some washed up old guy in space of 2 games.,4
Imagine gayle not opening and coming at 4 in this situation,8
Why is KL playing like Babar?,4
Ugh india new zealand t20 vibes,8
Wtf are KXIP doing making this chase so close while down only 2?!,9
Good catch from Rana,3
Lol,2
"More than the wicket, that's a dot ball!",2
Hahahahahahaa,1
This is bizarre from KXIP,3
I don’t think it’s a question anymore... this is done and dusted.,2
Pathetic attempt at a big shot.,1
LOL HOW IS PUNJAB BOTTLING THIS,2
"WTF. If KXIP lose, they have themselves to blame. This is silly shit",6
KXIP is more RCB than the actual RCB,5
Prasidh so underrated. Excellent spell so far! 👏,1
ROFL so much for being a PIA the entire first half,1
Brain Dead Middle order,1
Looks like he dropped it! What was the white thing,3
Does Rahul not like Mandeep or something? Why is he not sent even now. Karun Nair was given all the freakin opportunities to suceed at 3 before being dropped. Mandeep is just being fucked with,5
Bruh feeling really sad for Kumble rn,1
Lol so tense,3
Choke.exe,5
I'm going to cry if we win,5
Seriously 😂,3
Maxi for the win?,2
LoL Punjab!,5
Peak KXIP right there,4
Maxwell doesn’t play spin well. They should have sent Mandeep. KXIP are making a mess of this.,1
Typical kxip,5
"Maxwell this is your chance , I'll forgive you for the past if you win this for us.",10
Should i laugh or cry?,2

"Is it time to spell Kings with a C, FFS",5
What the fuck is happening,5
Even South Africa doesn't choke like this😂,4
What a blunder to take that catch and let Maxwell out there,4
Was that catch? 😂😂I failed to notice,5
We're going to bottle this aren't we lmao,6
BOOM! Thank you Rana,3
Now watch Maxi get caught in the deep  trying to slog.,2
"Why Maxi, why?",2
Ian Bishop is a fucken boss,3

"If Kings lose this, Kumble needs to go.",7
Dude this is the worst team in the history of cricket,7
Sending that idiot Infront of Maxwell was the biggest mistake. One of the best finishers in the world not sent to finish the game. Stupid.,7
Oh dear oh dear OH DEAR ME,4

7 balls is enough make you a villain. Top notch stuff from Simran there,3
We have a thriller boyss...,3
"I suspect that is Kedar masquerading as Simran Singh. Dhoni dropped him, so might have come here to play the MoM role.",4

"It’s confirmed. If KL finds his SR dipping below 130, he needs to get out",1
"**18.6** Prasidh Krishna to Rahul, OUT, bowled'im. This is what happens when you leave yourself too much to do. Suddenly 74 off 58 doesn't look like a great effort after all. Full toss outside off, Rahul looks for the boundary into the leg side, and gets a big inside edge onto his wicket **151-4**

KL Rahul  b Prasidh Krishna 74 (58b 6x4 0x6) SR: 127.58",2
I love Rahul so focused in his own stats this shouldn't have been close,2
Oh that's a fucking great ball,2
Win or lose KKR should definitely go ahead with Prasidh in every game.,3
Just wow.,1
Can Maxi redeem himself?? Keep watching to find out!,1

Punjab need to improve their luck more than batting or bowling.",5

Prasidh Krishna the absolute MadLad.,2
They're gonna run 12 aren't they,3
Chokey chokey,8
Can’t believe rcb is the only team to lose to these guys,11
Whatever the result this over by Prasidh I think is promising enough to keep him in the team. Bowling 140+ yorkers like this is an asset.,5
11 crores for 14 runs you can do it buddy,7
How the hell kkr has managing to win the losing games,3
Sad stuff,3
Lmao,1
It seems that Maxi doesn't pick narine. He is just gonna swing,2

This will be the 3rd game bottled. 

Should be top....sitting bottom",2
"Indian fans: why don't India have any finishers? Why can't anyone finish a game apart from Kohli and Dhoni

Also Indian fans: wtf are you doing sending the inexperienced Indian batsman out to finish a game?

 How the fuck else are they gonna learn?",9
Kxip playing like RCB as well as CSK at the same time,3

Reverse....4...Brave choice!,1
Most one sided thriller game ever,4
We did it guys. We fucking did it.,3
Super owner possible,2
How fucking shit is Maxwell LOL he can barely connect,4
Damn why did they send Prabsimran before Mandeep who is senior and did well at 3 in the only match he played up the order. Braindead strategy .,6
Wtf.. y review that? Other than giving batsman time to breath .,5
Reverse sweeping at this stage is....well maxwell i guess,10

Peak meme moment.....,3

If KL and Mayank played more aggressive in the middle overs then this game would've been over ages ago,6
WHAT A CHOKE,8
😭😭💔,2
Just tuned in.. wtf happend. They should've won this,6
"I just tuned in, KXIP have taken it too deep ?",3
"GET FUCKED, WHAT IS THIS CLUB MAN FFS",4
It’s amazing that an innings of 74 can cost your side the match. As 95% of people recognised Rahul had to go harder.,8
Who's in for a super over ??,4
What's the DK Captaincy status now,7
"Holy Shit, Preity is crying",5
Lol at that girls reaction.,3

KKR should do more of this batting first tbh,1

"So this is what it means to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory

You have probably the two best openers right now and the rest of your batsman are trash?",5
"Dude we don't choke this bad while chasing, maybe defending but not chasing.",12
"God dann this is depressing, even from a neutral perpspective",8
I went for a nap at the start of this innings cause I thought it’d be a snoozefest.. so glad I woke up before it ended lol,6
WE WANT SUPEROVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR,6
Fuck this useless franchise. Liquidate them. Disband them. I don't want to ever see you again.,2
I was a fan of RCB before but this is definitely more painful. Atleast you know straight away that you're losing if you're a fan of RCB,6
FUCK YEAH KKR,6
Super over please,2
Feeling sad for Punjab fans. Such a shit team this is. Can't even score 22 of last 3 overs.,5
"If Dubta Punjab movie ever needed a script, this is it",5

Come on Maxi. Give us a Super over.,3
Wtf Jordan,2

How did Punjab do this? U can't do what we did against them😭,3
All bow before Lord DK,2
Super over,1
6 needed for super over!!!,1
This is depressing,1
"As i said, keep calm and trust Punjab's middle order.",3
"Wait.. y maxi did not cross ...?

Ok..he crossed..",2
Oh they didn't cross? Fudge.,2
Why the fuck would u keep Maxwell if you are just going to send in Prabsimran ahead of him!?,4
"They needed 22 of 18. They've scored 15 runs in the last 17 balls with a well set Rahul at one end.

Absolute madness.",5

Narine > Any death over bowler.,2
"Kkr winning this ipl

Calling it now",1
Wtf just happened😂,3
This is worse than what csk did lol,4
KKR have managed this without the services of Russel at death,4
Strike rate is rated just fine,5
Most of the matches you score atleast 90 after playing 58 fucking deliveries,2
"This kkr is giving me 2014 vibes

Narine bowling at death

Give them any total they will defend it",8
Lmao what the fuck LOL,1
Rahul looks like he's going to cry,2
Punjab comes up with creative ways to lose,1
Maxi to hit a six and explode in super over,3
Can maxi?,2
dude.. even by RCB standards this is a pretty hard choke.. ahh!! indeed we are long lost brothers.. :(,4
I am still comprehending what the fuck is going on,1
Rahul still be like strike rate doesn't matter,4
Which fucking cunt decided to send Prabhsimran????,7
Ultimate choke,6
Jordan can hit,1
"Some players, Mandeep, Saha, Parthiv, etc. have been around forever. There's immense data on them that prove they're just average. Why not go with young players instead?",2
KXIP lives and dies with Rahul.,2
Rahul really has a mindset problem. Was doing the same during the world cup.,2
KXIP simply play T20s wrong. It’s way better to go for it and have a bunch of batsmen hit 20s/30s than hole out at 70 odd off 60 balls.,3
That's the juiciest golden duck I've seen in a while,3
"**19.5** Narine to Mandeep Singh, OUT, he goes for a six into the big side of the ground. Clever bowling from Narine. KKR are favourites now. He has holed out. Gets too much under this front-of-the-hand delivery. Taken at deep midwicket **158-5**

Mandeep Singh c sub (CJ Green) b Narine 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",3
KXIP just shit the bed,1
Switch hit six or straight down the ground six.. Leg side six nearly impossible,1
Come on Maxi. This is that last chance or fuck off forever.,1
I wonder if Rahul still think SR doesn't matter...LOL,4
Who is Baz talking with in the walkie talkie?,1
I used to feel sorry for KXIP and Rahul but seems like they don't have winning mentality.,2
You deserve to lose if you can’t chase 165 after an opening partnership of 115,9
"Total disappointment watching punjab lose this , they are losing close games ...",3
"Fucking great writers, hire them for next season too please.",6
"If it goes to super over. One may miss few overs from other game..

Over rate has been pathetic this ipl...Stupid strategic timeout doesn't help either",6
Lol KXIP.,2
Who does McCullum talk to with his walkie talkie?,5
Maxwell has more confidence on his reverse sweep than any normal shot,4
What really matters is the Orange Cap,6
Memes XI Punjab.,5
Maxi did not cross?,1
KXIP out RCBing RCB lol.,1
Maybe Kings XI Punjab need to change their name to King XI Punjab,4
poor KL if he doesn't do it all himself it doesn't happen,0
Maxwell do something pls. High time.,3
Why does KXIP has to take the game soo deep?,3
Why wax Maxwell not sent in earlier.. baffling,2
Can't wait when people will credit Morgan for this turnaround,2
absolute shithousery,1
This is a proper choke.,2
If maxwell hits a six will they broadcast super over instead of next match,7
Punjab screws up every game. Except the game with Chennai. They should've won most of the games they lost.,5
Bottling at it's best (KXIP edition),1
chicks with daddy issues and arts degrees don't choke this much,3
how is Narine even pronounced? Surely cant be Narayan as showing in star sports :(,4
I think we were a bit too hard on Kohli when he didn’t want Kumble.,18
"Friendship broken with RCB Memes, now KXIP memes is my new best friend..",8
Now Kxip fans must know the pain DC fans endured against them when DC choked in the similar position last year.,3
KXIP is gonna be messed up after this match,4
OMGGGG,2
You never know,2
They had plenty of wickets in hand. KL should have gone harder.,2
This is the anil kumble who was gonna be Indian coach lmfao,3

Even Umpire showed some emotion. Paid his F to Kxip.,19
Heist!,7
"Kumble as coach, KL as captain - is a mistake. Sack both from their positions.",13
Rahul on suicide watch,14
Lol this is getting funnier,14
Wow. The umpire did not even go up to check,6
Omg omg omg omg watteh match,5
Press F to pay Respect,12
Banter,4
"Brett lee lost his mind, said he heard a no ball.",6
Lol they lost by 2 runs,8

Kl please retire,1
F,3
"Oh



MY





GOD",8
How did that not go third umpire,10
That was next level umpiring.,13
KXIP have to rethink their tactics. That was a game they should have won yet they found a strange way to lose.,6
it bounced like an inch before the boundary.,5
'No Show' strikes again! Properly messed up that chase,0
Literally a centimetre in it ffs,10
Prabhsimran muh man Rofl,3

Scriptwriters pls leave some drama for actual tv shows,5
See. A few inches matter. :(,12
KL and KL alone is responsible for this,5
FFS missed by millimeters,8
The umpire's face when he signalled that 4 was priceless,31
It's literally one inch. Oh my god,5
Lenskart will use this umpiring decision for their next ad,10

StRiKe RaTe DoEsNt MaTtEr,16
OMFGGGG WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING MY BRAIN OMGGGGG STOP THIS TORTURE,6
You can't fake or fix such spots. Real life is stranger than fiction,12
Damn the umpire has eagle eye,10
Wtf man what was this match,3
That's the most minute distance from boundary line. This match deserved that.,4
Holy shit,2
Oh if this doesn't get best original screenplay then oscar is fixed,3
Literal definition of a close match,9
I literally left the game to eat breakfast. Mayank and KL were batting. What happened lmaoo,2
Second consecutive game where KKR win after their opponents choke a chase after cruising,4
If only the boundaries are 2 inches shorter. Barest of margins^(TM),8
I'm not so sure now when my Gf said size doesn't matter.,6
The gap was the size of my dick,18
Short by 2 inches. WTF!!,6
"The umpire was like: *fuck this, they ain’t paying nobody overtime*",13
Yay.. Kkr pro clutching,3
How something less than 6inches made all the difference...,7
The Scriptwriters this year are on another level,21
missed by a hair line..,5
Oof.,3
Poor rahul,3
Incredible call buy the umpire.,9
KXIP living the true 2020 nightmare,7
Maxi had to be sent in instead of Prabh. That bottled the match for Punjab. They’ll punish Prabh by dropping him after this,13
"Maxwell is the most overrated ipl player ever, every damn year. If he was from the West Indies he would’ve been dropped back in 2014",0
"Man, even Bollywood can't come up with such scripts. Only the Manga can top this shit.",14
Lmao at this rate an in-form kl will retreat back to 2(4),3
kkr with 4 win out of 6 games lol,16
"Fuck it'd have been awesome if it was a six, well, off to CSK v RCB",5
if Maxwell had one more Weet Bix he would have gone for 6,6
Tough Luck,1
"Kumble is shit. Glad he was kicked out as the Indian coach. 

No-one would send Simran over Mandeep, Maxi in this situation",8
Narine you absolute beauty.,3
WTF,1
Me trying to make sense if it's a 4 or a 6 on a 360P stream.,8
Kxip loose by 2 inches lol,11
"Had this been a football league, KXIP should have been relegated.",5
"Feel so bad for Maxi, so so close.",8
Wow Homelander is the Umpire!,2
Cucks XI Cuckjab,9
DK you beauty,4
That probably couldn't be closer to a six haha,3
"Haath me aaya mooh na laga

Edit: fixed it",2
Kumble is a massive idiot for sending Prahbsimran ahead of Maxwell,15
Wtf did I just watch....,3
By the barest of margins^TM,11
I can't support this stupid team anymore. Sending some idiot Infront of someone who can win you a match. Maxwell should have been a no brainer.,6
KL Babarul,2
Gareebi me aata geela,4
"losing by 2"", sounds like my love life",13
yikes that’s so unlucky,2
"Insert handshake meme from predator with KL and Hulkenberg as each arm, and me being blue-balled in the centre.",6
KKR win by 5 cms,11
Fuck I cannot believe it,5
"Fuck off kxip. Seriously, this is ultimate choke. Sack the captain and coach",8
Should've sent Jordan ahead of those Domestic wankers at least.,6
Another Houdini act from DK and his band of magicians- Bish,10
"Err, what the fuck?",10
By the barest of margins!,7
Why have Maxwell when you don't bring him in the 17th over. Brain-dead kxip deserve this,15
As women say couple of inches can make a huge difference.,11
Umpire must have some super powers to be able to spot that,6
That is literally BAREST OF MARGINS bruh wtf,6
Laughed out loud. They needed 22 off 18. Bahahaha! How do you lose that?,12
Lmao how the hell did we manage to win this,6
Gaffney confirmed having a bionic eye with 16x zoom. No clue how he gave it a four on-field when it was so close.,13
Don't blame the captaincy. This is just a trash middle order.,6
bigSAD,2
Fuck KXIP,2
Gaffney saw that in real time? Chad,6
So close to a 6. Still somebody is gonna say this is fixed too.,2
What should i even say right now,3
This is the new barest of margins imo.,3
This was the most RCB way to lose ever,2
"Narine is a champion player for kkr, not at peak but bowls difficult overs",9
[removed],2
This shit has to be fixed lmaooo,1
Pooran cost KXIP the match. He should have just rotated the strike.,1
"One shot Maxwell nailed, absolutely nailed...",2
F for Punjab,2
ANOTHER NEESHAM TEAM LOSING IT BY “THE BAREST OF MARGINS”,12
"I know orange cap should be respected, but Rahul should wear it on his ass",30
I love how the KXIP theme song played after that boundary,5
KXIP inches away from victory. Yet again.,7
It's not even sad anymore lmao it's just funny,10
"6 inches... 

Difference between super over and KKR victory",7
Motm kl rahul?,1
Punjab really found a way to lose a comfortable win,7
Maxi is gonna face all the shit but this was not his fault at all,11
The “it’s fixed “ gang can’t refute to this now,7
"Gee, turns out, strike rate does matter after all",8
Umpire reaction video anyone?,4
KXIPKLPD,6
One of the greateat matches ever (inches matter)+ worst choke of all time,15
Petition to rename Hawkeye to Gaffney Eye,13
"4 by the smallest margin possible lol

I bet that if KXIP were having a good season and KKR were having a shit season this would have landed on the ropes.",13
"Ok.. I was gone to run some errands. KXIP were at 100 some for 0, and needed 8 rpo. I thought this match was a wrap. I come back, they need 6 off the last ball just for the tie. And then lose the match in dramatic fashion.",7
Haha - Dinesh Karthik and a Houdini act ! Such an apt comparison,7
How has cricket not got ultra edge at the boundary yet that's twice this match its had to be checked,5
How come they didn't go for the third umpire,2
"I wasn’t watching, how the fuck did they manage to bottle this???",11
Can't even comment they all should better go home and fuck off forever,7
game of the ipl 2020 ?,6
"Did KKR remove an ""s"" from their name or something? Looks like they did some numerology magic to get this run of luck",8
Fs in chat bois,7
"I do not know how KKR is pulling these off. But, I am loving it.

Please win more convincingly next time!!!",16
KKR bowlers in last two games,7
"KL : "" StRiKe RaTeS ArE OvEr RaTeD!""

Me: "" Chup kar bhen ke dine""",16
Punjab needs to win next 6 games out of 7 to qualify. Lol.,12
This is the alternate universe version of Lagaan where the Englishman hits it just short of 6,25
Kxip gonna have PTSD,9
I am dead inside juat like Maxwell is rn,12
who the fuck is simran and why was he sent before max?,14
Cursed XI Punjab,7
"Damn, that was so close to a six",4
"Get in wtf lol, anyway we won :)))))",2
i can't even cry anymore,9
I can't believe it,6
Kumble wtf was he thinking?,8
That painful feeling when Maxwell missed by just a few cms..........,8
Fucking 1 or 2 inches,3
Next time let only Gayle take the field.,4
Performance Bonus application for Narine and Prasidh,7
KL Rahul: Orange is the new W,8
Maxwell looks dead inside,3
Pretty easy to give that from the naked eye tbh. Ball flew up from the rope substantially. Although I don't mind a fixed brainlessly followed SOP of always referring these incidents upstairs,5
Gotta feel for Maxwell. Granted he hasn't performed but you can see him trying.,10
"We all asked for a nailbiter, so far IPL2020 never budged until this game. And how it gave? Almostl Lagan style",5
Poor KL with the orange cap but a team that is last,6
This is peak choke if I've ever seen one. Why did Punjab send that Simran guy ahead of Maxi? Anyone?,24
🤡 performance from Punjab.,9
I gave benefit of doubt to KL so far but this is purely his failure. Who the fuck cares if he got the orange cap?,9
Never leave it to the last over...,12
So DK actually won KKR this game with his innings,26
I hope CSK vs RCB match is as good as this gold we witnessed today,4
https://old.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j8gq33/match_thread_24th_match_kings_xi_punjab_v_kolkata/g8bj5v4/,3

Rahul take that orange cap and install it on ya ass forever and roam around,18
HAHAHAHAH CLASSIC PUNJAB,6
Maxwell did everything he could this time,12

Good to see a really close game again,5
"If you play 50 balls , it's your Job to finish the game",11
How did we do that?,3
I never even considered that scenario ever in my life. To lose a game by literally 2 inches. Fuck anyone who calls cricket boring,16
Imagine losing because of an inch,12
"Whose decision is it to send simran before maxwell, that dude scored 4 out of 7 balls at death. Didn't even try to slog",6
rahul and agarwal are gonna get fuckin injured bc they have to carry their team every week,10
From Punjab you deserve better to Maxwell you deserve better,6
Turns out strike rate matters after all,13
"That's it. Get Maxwell out, Gayle in.",2
Kumble needs to fire himself after he’s basically lost his team the game,7
4th game where punjab should have won but lost.,13
They should have sent Maxwell instead of simran,7
"Ffs IPL writers calm down , I can't handle that much emotion in 3 hours",13
Kl should have finished this,3
Dinesh Karthik delivered the ultimate fuck you to r/cricket this game.,15
"Now I see why Kohli kicked Kumble out

Dude sent Simran instead of Maxi wtf, that was the match lost right there",9
SRK >>>>>> Ambani,11
"Now I have to see a sad KL again, which makes me sad 😞",12
"Sending Prabhsimran before Maxwell. You deserved to lose, Punjab.",17
"4th spot to be fought between RCB, CSK and SRH.",6
Everybody apologies to DK now!!!!,9
**HAARE HUE MATCH KO JEETNE WALE KO KKR KEHTE HAIN**,6
"Maxi should have kept the strike for whole last over, no single!",3
And this my friends is why Narine is never dropped from KKR.. clutch last over...,8
Sky just showed the wc final replay! By the barest of margins!!,2
"Unlucky Maxy, good effort mate. :(",5
People accusing KL of caring for orange cap more than the match reminds of 90s cricket fans.,6
Congratulations to Punjab for losing a match that was well placed! CSK welcomes you!,9
My best part about this is that little smile by the umpire towards the end. Even he can't stop himself from laughing at the absurdity.,11
"Loved it!

Punjab snatched defeat from the jaws of victory!",12
"People, fucking YuppTv switched to the other match. I just want to know what KL said in the post match interview. Please please",2
Thats some balls from the umpire given the current umpire decisions,6
Oops peak Narine might be back. Crazy how good a spinner can be at the death .,7
Let's watch the next one and pretend I am RCB fan.,5
"Rahul and Mayank had the chance to play KKR out of this match, but then who cares about S/R. Where are the KL fans now?",6
Wow how kxip stopped watching thinking it would be boring easy chase. Though when I saw 20 runs requird from 2 overs I switched on . What a pathetic management who sent youngster ahead of Maxwell,3
I stopped watching after 10 overs cuz I was sure kkr lost. Now this. Lmfaoooo,5
Guess KL went inside to screw Prabhsimran in the ass,5
Damn that umpire good,6
Oh boy post mach thread gonna be fucking lit. ~~Kings~~ chokker XI can kiss good bye to their playoffs dreams.,3
"Bottled 1 from 3

Couldn't defend 220+

Today

Wtf is up with this team 🤣",12
Why are people blaming Maxwell here? It was completely Rahul's fault both as captian and batsman,18
"KXIP are not gonna make it, nor do we.",2
"Strike rates are overrated guys. Believe me I am the Orange Cap

&#x200B;

\- Thala Rahul",13
"Man these 2 past KKR games,RR vs KXIP and the Australian ODI I was just wanting to be a dumb optimist but the teams I supported actually won.",9
KXIP BIGGEST HAGGUS IN THIS YEARS IPL CONFIRMED,3
Where are the shits saying if only Morgan had been Captain,5
I love how Maxwell hugged Narine after that final ball. He seems like such a nice and positive dude,26
"Bowlers winning the match in the death overs.

Rare sights.",3
"Strike rates are very, very overrated. It's all about winning games for the team.",3
Big F for Punjab. It's just sad.,5
By the barest of margins,4
"Death, Taxes and Kings 11 Losing. Is it because we are the new RCB?",5
Mayank Agarwal deserves to be in a better team.,9
Guys stop strike rates are overrated,9
We'll miss you,2
Boys! We have a winner. Kings offically snatched the baton from RCB!,10
Jadhav then and simran now. Who the hell sends that guy before Maxwell,5
You understand why some people think the game is fixed 😫,6
Sunil Narine never smiles.,9
What a finish.. this game is something else,3
"Come on Guys, head over to shitting on Csk now",8
ON TO CSK VS RCB BOIZ!,3
"I reckon the last time KL Rahul actually accelerated the innings was vs RCB, that too after being dropped twice!! Mahn, such a top player, definitely need to rethink a bit, if not a lot now...",10
" You can take Karnatka players out of RCB, but you cannot take RCB out of them",16
That was worse than Tottenham coming third in a 2 horse race ahahahahahhahahahahahahaha,13
Dissolve this club.,16
[deleted],7
How do you even lose from there?,9
This is worse than RCB level choking. This is unbelievable.,12
It was too much to ask from Maxwell probably but why the hell the storm still hasn't played a single game? Is he injured or what??,4
How have we pulled this off twice now,15
KXIP need to target to win the game in the 19th over,6
I will say this again and again. Kayle is way too relax when his partner does well. He cannot be blamed totally but he does play a part.,7
kOhLi Is A rEtArD fOr GeTtInG rId Of KuMbLe,6
KXIP making great arguments for RCB fans to switch sides,7
"Other teams go crazy to find out the right combination. For KKR to get back to winning ways, all it took was to shave off their captain's beard!",15
Why was the post match thread removed?,3
We find ways to win losing games.,7
Was unfair to expect maxwell 14 off Narine having just come to the crease,10
This is just sad now,5
Even umpire was laughing at that boundary,10
This game reflects punjabs campaign perfectly.,10
Kings Xl chokejab,6
We are just winning somehow,12
Now i am heavily leaning towards Koach between Kumble-Koach dispute.,14
"SendMaxwell up the order at 28 off 23, This is street level cricket from KXIP think tank. Kumble needs to drop himself. Now I get why Koach threw him out of Indian team .",10
Only if Arshdeep Singh didn't bowled wide yorker 😂😂😂,3
[removed],7
Boundaries are so arbitrary. It would have been 6 if the padding was an inch closer,7
"Man I missed the second game on dream11, leave it, KKR wins!",9
Well that was hilarious,5
"Hey KL, SR still overrated mate?",9
Sent Simran ahead of Maxi when they needed 25 odd runs off 3 overs.....,6
Absolute bottlejobs. Fucking useless team. I am done. I ain't watching you anymore.,19
COMEBACK KKR!,9
I don't think KL deserves the hate he is getting right now,6
KXIP pulling an RCB better than RCB themselves,9
Feeling bad for Maxy.,12
KL Rahul is the most unlucky captain in the IPL,1
Why the fuck would you not send Maxwell ahead if you aren’t keeping him in the squad? Prahbsimran wasted 2-3 balls.,12
"That innings by KL shows how important match awareness is in cricket. You can have all the talent in the world, but if you don’t know how to use it you will cost your side games.",10
"Difference of Margin. 

New Zealand getting PTSD Watching this match",20
"22 off 18. After this point, Rahul faced only 4 balls and scored 4 runs. The blame has to fall on Simran. Those 3 dots in a row against Narine were criminal.

Rahul kinda choked by getting out at a crucial phase, but he doesn't deserve blame for SR. He paced his innings perfectly.",6
r/Cricket did meme Maxwell into some form. Not enough to meme KXIP into winning though.,20
Lol people actually blaming the loss on Maxi in here. Absolute clowns,13
"I hope the Maxwell bashing stops, because despite being in terrible form he did the best he could. Luck wasn't on his side.",31
Reminder guys strike rates are very very overrated,16
"Rahul combined Faf, Rayudu, Dhoni n Jhadav inning in his 1 inning",16
"The best thing about this match:-

You could literally see the change of emotions in KXIP dugout. 

From clapping after Nagarkoti's over 

to a sence of worry 

to panic 

and finally the disappointment, the shock",18
if MSD had done what DK did today there would be 15 page articles written everywhere..😂,29
"This loss is on Rahul. Should have taken the responsibility to see this home.

Although the decision to send in Prabhsimran ahead of Maxwell, regardless of his form, is just as shocking.",20
"You know what was brilliant?

DK giving Narine the last over instead of second last, knowing KXIP are chokers",19
I'm still not over from this match pls wait to start next,1
Holy shit how did you end up losing Punjab. Only SRH is capable of bottling a 24 off 21 chase. Nice to have company I guess.,12
The question is....was the rope where it should be or was it one or two inches behind?,-7
Snatching defeat from jaws of victory thats kings 11 p,11
Koach was right about Kumble. He is useless.,12
"Rr, kxip and kkr next face rcb. This is pure luck for them",6
Dk pulling of a Nidahas with his captaincy this time,19
this match was directed by Martin Scorsese,13
Is punjab out of playoffs yet?,7
"I know I was making fun last game but seriously wanted KXIP to win
How??",2
Kinky KKR..like choking huh,10
MaStEr StRaTeGiSt Kumble lolololol,16
Lmao how did Punjab fuck that up. Even RCB wouldn't have lost from that position,15
Those blaming management should remember maxwell was not conneting ball at all this seasin,10
"Why would they not bring out maxi at 4. The management are  an absolute joke

Kumble has to go

&#x200B;

Won fuck all as a player, and is equally as bad in management",7
KXIP on suicide watch.,12
"Toxic comments all over instagram and twitter as usual. Thankfully Rahul doesn't have kids. These ""fans"" are horrible.",22
Fuck that was a weird match! KL & KXIP unnecessarily took it deep. Snatching defeat from jaws of victory. TF is Kumble planning there?,15
"Kl Rahul with ss of 128 said SS doesn't matter.

As a matter of fact mayank had SS of 143.5",12
When is the post match presentation telecast?,8
"what bowling from KKR btw, hats off man",10
I usually don't like overreact but if it was KL decision to send Simran above Maxwell then KXIP need to chance their captain to Mayank ASAP that decision had no logic.,3
"This defeat is completely on Rahul. Fuck you and your ""strike rate doesn't matter"" statements if you cannot take the team home. Another sub 130 SR match in a losing cause, and today he didn't even show intent after Simran got out. Embarrassing. Shove your approach and orange cap up your arse, mate.",18
Can we talk about the comeback Prasidh made after being cunted for boundaries early on?,12
"KKR is the most unorthodox team. 

Neva know who's batting where
Neva know who's bowling when
Will drop catches at will. 

Fool the opponent into complacency, almost give the match away and somehow snatch it back.",37
"We may set a low target, we may field bad, we may give the opposite runs but we will somehow end up winning the game.",11
Rahul and Kumble sacked . Mayank made new captain of kings11.,5
I wanted Punjab ko qualify so bad this year with dc and rcb as they haven't done it ever.but fuck you k11 you all don't deserve. Dissolve ya self and go masturbate on ya captain's orange kinky cap,7
Kxip ka KLPD hogaya,11
I really feel bad for KXIP and Rahul. Hope it doesn't ruin Rahul's form.,8
maxwell should be at 4,3
"Fucking chahar, he was in the crease",2
"Don't blame Maxwell or Mandeep they tried their best, blame the batsman who was playing ODI",22
props to Prasidh Krishna.. first match of the tournament and such a game changing performance..well done..,15
"Honestly, KL didn't show any intent to win, KXIP needs a captain and KL Rahul should play freely, They should've bid for someone like Morgan, hope their mega auction goes well",7
Lol pacer tryna mankad,3
"People were more excited for CSK vs RCB, can they match this....

Damn people blaming KXIP , but actual wonder is done by KKR and Narine, also prasidh",8
We know which team is going to be dead silent at dinner tonight,12
"F you MBA, that's how you make the best out of the limited resources - DK",11
"They knew narine will be left for last few overs.

Was setting simran a wise decision ? Instead you had maxwell and Mandeep",15
Teams having Eoin Morgan tend to steal victory out of nowhere,37
"Big appreciation for Narine, what a champion player  
Prasidth impressed too  
I feel kkr bowling will do well on big grounds",10
This and that CSK match. Great performance by the KKR bowlers just when you think things were going to shit for them,13
"*Strike Rate? Ye kya hota hai bey?*

"Someone said afternoon games are boring, and complained that this is too boring to watch. 

*IPL writers are read your comments and made it intresting. Are you entertained?*",19
Where's that chap who promised to delete his account if punjab looses?? I demand one less account!!,30
Maxwell's wife: I always told him those extra 2 inches matter,17
Punjab should really experiment with maxwell at 3. He is a genuine match winner on his day and there is nothing to lose at this point,9
I know Maxwell is not in great touch this IPL but should have sent him after Pooran wicket fell as Maxwell has been in such situations before and knows that best thing to do was give strike to Rahul. By sending Prabhsimran singh they not only built up pressure on Rahul but also did no good to confidence of the young man,22

"With all the praise going to Narine and Dk, we shouldn't forget Prasidh. What a lad.",42
Maxwell keeping the tradition and maintaining his position in the charts of Most balls faced without hitting an six(61 balls).,23
KKR matches are turning out to be one sided until the last two overs,31

Kxip chokes better than my ex,24
22 reqd of 18 balls and Narine gave only 2 runs with a wicket  20 from 12 after his over,24

"What the fuck Punjab, why not send out maxwell instead of prabhsimran. The blokes playing his 3rd match, what were they expecting fk sake",29
"Kkr bowling defending 3 below par total n stopping first batting to below par once ie 4 times in 6

One of the most underrated bowling",28
I really hope KL not to become Indian team captain. Iyer is the way to go after Koach,28

SRK is really a lucky charm for KKR. He should come and see all the matches ❤️,24

Maxwell's 4 and dhoni's 2019 sf runout that close,24

"Pooran innings was similar to Curran in csk match, after his dismissal i thought we can have a repeat of csk win",18
KXIP were just 2 inches short of satisfaction,31
KXIP fans - no need for a new sadness thread. Just revive the last one which has been active this season,40
"Don't troll too much guys, feel for the KXIP fans, probably everyone changed their flairs by now, but still.",34
IPL script writers putting a twist in today's game.,24
" At a point, I thought we are losing by 10 wickets 😭",48
"In 15 years of T20 cricket, haven't come across a single team whose strategy is to let an opener play 60 balls striking at 120 hoping the others can just get in and smash the bowlers. Except RR with Rahane, which yielded them unparalleled recognition. Now, can we guess why teams like this don't exist?

Fuck KL Rahul.",32
"I regret missing the last few overs. Is there a way to see the full match highlights, not that 15 mins thing.",12
"After two similar wins for kkr, credit has to be given to kkr bowlers for tight bowling in death overs  
Not a fluke",44
"i promise this is the last one for the day..

You can take a RCBian out of RCB but you can’t take RCB out of RCBian..

PS: RCB for life..",19
respect kkr. coming out on top in tight games is really important in the ipl. they now look like serious challengers for the trophy.,25
"There’s something about DK who pulls shit like this. Remember Nidahas trophy, no one even thought that was possible. And again this IPL, this time 2 matches in a row",37
"Ahh, perfect match for ""wtf just happend, I thought KXIP gonna win this easily so changed the channel""",31
"See you next year my fellow Kings XI supporters, when we're not our own worst enemy. Love and respect. Hopefully we'll be in rare form next season.",26

You can take KL out of RCB but you can't take the RCB out of KL.,58
KKR had very similar games this week. Narine in the death and pre-death overs is a really good strategy.,27
The important fact is that KL Rahul extended his lead in the orange cap.,38
"That one over from Rana where just 7 runs came, was handy",23
This is worse than our loss to KKR. They had so little to score in 4 overs with 9 wickets in hand. Switched to tennis and saw Kings XI had lost just now. Safe to say we won't finish last this year,43
I humbly apologise to DK to question his captaincy. You have put us in our place. Great win. Great captaincy. Great batting. Hats off sir.,23

"A big middle finger to all the Dinesh Karthik haters, who were continuously saying to drop him from KKR midseason. In the last two matches, he made great bowling changes and today, he even fired with the bat.

I slept when they needed 29 runs in 24 balls. I was thinking that they might still lose, and they proved me right.

Well done boys.",30

Maybe Kohli was on to something. This KXIP team is in shambles.,5
DK's inning was a 'Fuck you' to his haters. Maybe his new shave is helping,21
I actually feel bad for KXIP and Rahul now. That short run and now losing by 2mm.,14

That’s not jadeja lmfao jadeja would have caught that,5
"After this match, I contemplated if I should change my flair from KXIP to India (to become a neutral fan), but finally decided against that. It's better to have a team to support than being neutral/choosing random team, even if your team perform super shit. I'm supporting KXIP since 2008.

Cause of disgusting failure of KXIP:
-Shitty management. Didn't bid on any captain. Didn't bid on quality pacers. Fuck off.

-KL is a shit captain. Never saw him performing under pressure. Let him be a batsman/opener/wk whatever. He's definitely not a captain material. Doesn't even console his bowlers when they are getting pounded. He just stands there having ""oh shit"" expression. Da hell, man. 

-Kumble. Maybe, Kohli was right all along. They send Simran instead of Mandeep or Maxi, when you need runs against Narine. Seriously? I would make better decision here, when I was 16. Fuck off, Kumble.",24
