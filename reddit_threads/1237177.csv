"I am not mad at Delhi Capitals for chasing that within 17.3 overs. I understand, coming after so many consecutive losses, and many out of form batsmen - it would have been tough to chase the total within 20 overs too.

But I am really mad at Mumbai Indians, for the way they played against SRH on Tuesday.

Pant has only hit 3 sixes in the overs 16-20 this season while Pollard has hit 20 and Hardik has hit 14. Need some big runs from him today,5

"I am gonna call it right here I have a feeling Sams is gonna be the X Factor for us, has flown below the radar in the 2 games cos wicketless but has bowled extremely well except the last over prev game. Makes it better that he can hit some lusty blows",4
"This season really changed my opinion on rohit's place in the team. All these seasons of rohit underperforming seemed fine because we needed a captain and a big indian player to represent us. His batting didn't really matter because sky and hardik, pollard did well in middle order. 

I always thought that Pollard with his antiques would be a terrible captain, but he showed us in cpl and few games for mi that he is very mature and can definitely lead a team. 

Another problem is ishan Kishan's position. He has always been meh at number 4 but this season he seemed in form and got even better when he started opening. He also opened for gujarat lions and gave them explosive starts. 

I am anticipating that rohit will open and will ruin the batting momentum we got when qdk and kishan opened.",7
"Idk why but Shreyas looks  like he has no idea like '*TALK TO POINTING SIR, He's right there'*",6

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand how Delhi plays. Axar's impact is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of Nortje's balls will go over a typical batter's head. There's also Iyer's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Dash Player let me down, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these wins and losses, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Delhi truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Pant's existential catchphrase ""EASYEASYEASY"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Baz's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ponting's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them",21

Not one risky shot by de Kock,2
SAMS... was the wrong choice,1
DeCock makes my pp hard,1
Wtf,1
"Sams is good, this is an off over bad time for it to come but he needs to be backed",1
Quinny 😍😍😍,3
"Rohit gonna smash a century on Koachs birthday and screw the yo-yo test.

Rift confirmed",8
Nice of DC start to start with pies,2
de Cock is rising to the occasion,2
Why give Mumbai the momentum? Start with Rabada,1
"I fear one of these days, Prithvi Shaw would be running hard on field to stop the ball and would just dismantle like a robot’s head, arms and legs going into the air separately.",4
"QDK is literally in ""commando"" mode.
I can see kock right from here at home.",3
Oh no DC what are you doing,0
It's been just five minutes but you can clearly see the disparity in commentary quality between Gavaskar and Bhogle,5
Someone tell Sams it ain't De Kock's b'day today. Absolute dollies!,2
"After a strong start, Mumbai Indians have declared they have won the IPL 2020. Congratulations to them!",9
I hoped for a really nice match but this start says it's gonna be legendary.,2
I just want them to send pandya 1 down pollard 2 down and go for the kill,4
Deserve it for opening with Sams tbh... what a dumb move,1
Why is DC playing with black arm bands?,4
Quinny you beauty,-1
Somebody get those guys before they get going.,2
"They really wanted to torture us by making Gavaskar the commentator for a Mumbai game, huh",3
How does Ashwin pass that YoYo test?,3
Ashwin is quite a liability on the field,0
"I mean dew could be a factor in the second innings, but if Mumbai get 180-190 in a Knockout match. that's bloody GAME ON",5
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
Yar bhai kya he yar overseas Tushar Deshpande,2

Qdk: I've been on the choking side enough in my lifetime. Not today biotch!,3
"That over reminded me of Zaheer Khans first over vs Aus in 2003 final.

Match over in the first over.",1
"Me before the match : sledges Mumbai and cheers Delhi
Me after the match: da fuq",1
Hotstar shat the bed,1
"I wonder which is a bigger regret for RCB, leaving Quinny the best wicket keeper batsman right now, or not getting back chris gayle for base price and now they miss an explosive opener?",6
De Kock is scary,1
tf sams shimron's been robbed of a game,1
Why wouldn’t you open with Nortje or Rabada,0
Ashwin gonna get smacked; my sixth sense is tingling,-1
Looks like a good pitch for batting. Mumbai looks scarier than usual,0
There hasn’t been a more expensive first over this IPL? Don’t remember Cummins going for 19 vs. RR?,0
DC consists of 10 humans and one unbreakable phone,7
Ok so rohit on strike for first time....,0
WTF is that pitch,1
Hetmyer died for this,2
Delhi gonna be crucified - Jofradamus.,2
"Sams, and now Ashwin.... why would you give MI such a big momentum in PP?",-3
Hindi commentary is so so bad.,2
Why black band sorry for ignorance,1
After 8 balls rohit on strike,3
Bro Nortje looks like such a meanie but when he talks such a softie,1
Surely isn’t going to appeal that.,2

Do we know the reason DC players are wearing the black arm band?,2
Jeez Rohit.,2
Black band for ?,1
Woah rohit is like a walking wicket.....,5
Should’ve just rested,3
Chubby gone,-1
Why open with VadaPav when Kishan has been 10/10 in opening so far??,1
Who here commented that Rohit never delivers when they want him to,1
"Ethical bowler, ethical batsman.",5
Rohit: Why are u guys abusing selectors. Not on my watch!,5
Well it's Nohit today,7
gg Rohit,3
"Lol the comms literally said ""Ashwin had the cock last game"" hahahahaha",6
"That was such a lazy shot, God-damn it",6
Khikhikhi motu out,1
Gavaskar is fumbling lol,2
welp....,2
So everyone wanted kishan to open anyways right ?,7
Damnnnnnnn it was turning,8
"IMO, Sams has been good only in Abu Dhabi matches. He should be only played there. He will fare better there, and he will fare poorly in Dubai.",4
Letzzzoooo Ashhh!,3
Ashwin is the key.,2
Koach would've gone for the appeal,7
Rohit bad form in the playoffs continues...,6
Golden duck for Vada pav,8
Rohit and Knockout games,18
Saurabh Tiwari > Rohit Sharma.,-2
Wtf no review!!!!!!!!!!,2
Sunny G is depressed,3
Rohit playing as specialist Captain,10
"**1.3** Ashwin to Sharma, OUT, big offbreak first ball, and he has been given. Think he needn't review if he hasn;t hit this **16-1**

RG Sharma lbw b Ashwin 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",4
Atleast he didn't waste balls and a review /s,5
Ravi Ash you beauty,2
They brought in Ashwin for De Kock and he took the wicket of Rohit Sharma. Lmao,7
oh no rohit,2
Ashwin strikes at critical times.. great bowler.. and this was a terrific delivery,9
E G O   P L A Y Gets you no where..,3
Sharma is the Goat for me but fuck you mate its DC time.,4
Now Kishan can open in peace with QDK,6
😭😭😭😭😭😭,2
Well that was Anticlimactic,2
So Nohit today,2
Classic brohit,3
Looked worth a review tbh,3
Rohit: 0 Kohli: HBD,11
"Wait a minute, wasn't it pitching outside?",0
That was plump,1
Guys what's with all the black bands??,2
"Bada bing bada boom
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/johrcr/match_thread_qualifier_1_delhi_capitals_v_mumbai/gb82po8/",2
Rohit and QDK have a SR less than 100 in the PP against spinners. Why didn't Ashwin get the ball in the first over? Only Iyer knows.,6
Good opportunity for Rohit to prove selectors wrong wasted,6
"Why didn't we go with Rohit at 3?!

Why mess with the Ishan - QDK combo.",7
Good guy Ashwin making sure Rohit doesn’t get himself injured again,15
Nohit has appeared,9
Should've sent Kishan,2
Rohit be looking older than Zaheer Khan,7
"On a positive note, at least he didn't wasted the review",9
Why not send Ishan Kishan or is he not playing?,6
And I changed captain from dkock to Rohit Sharma at the last minute.,2
Should send Ishan Kishan because he plays well with QDK,9
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.,2
Sunny G in shambles,5
Why are DC players wearing black band around their arm?,4
Spinners bailing us out again.,2
Open with kishan next time onwards and just play rohit at 4 smh,3
Why are DC wearing a black armband?,4
Mumbai Indians were a better team without Rohit Sharma. Period.,9
"Dugout:  Rabada!!

Ash spins a brand-new ball!!",2
[deleted],8
PT cancelled for Rohit Sharma,0
I said it during the last game....saying it again.... Mumbai should’ve stuck with the consistent opening partnership and got in Rohit 1 down or at #4🙃 I hope they learn for the next game,2
Prior to this I was legit saying to my mom that he's probably gonna get out first ball,3
"Should have just rested. After facing a whole of 1 ball, will have to field for 20 Overs.",7
Umpire's call,0
"Quinton de Kock to Rohit: Ye main kar leta hu, aap Dream11 pe team bana lo",12

Why is Rohit terrible against spin?,2
Kohli R I F T confirmed???!!,7
Pathetic decision that,1
"Definitely worth a review that one, surprised de Koch didn't encourage him",4
Who should be the one spinner India play in Australia tests? RA or RJ?,0
Rohit is a walking wicket,0
"Ok, back to MI kicking DC's ass.",0
There was a MI fan abusing Ashwin for coming to bowl in the powerplay against Rohit and QDK ( he's clearly not seen cricket ) well searching for the comment now.,7
"Ashwin gets Rohit for a golden duck

He's clearly on Team Kohli",-1
Kinda want Mumbai to win. Easier for SRH to go to the final,-6
"Yess Quinny.

Looks business tonight.",0
"Scotty: ""kock's on fire""",7
QDK - fine i will do it myself,2
Yar QdK 100 nahi,1
Is decent start for both teams,0
13 duck in IPL for Rohit the most. 😂😭😂😭,-1
behenchod this was umpire's call? koach would've been vindicated I guess,2
QDK wants to take revenge for making us play him in our franchise for long,5
Left right combo isliye no kishan,1
Ashwin confirmed for all matches against aus /s,1
"QdK: Oh no, anyway.",6
QdK has been supremely important for MI. V underrated.,4
"if we can be 50/1 after 6, I take that as a win.",4
"I know Rohit is great and all but Kishan and Cock were getting really good starts, why break it?",2
Why did RCB remove De Kock again? Sometimes the shit this team does really tick me off.,6
QDK is about the drop a century.,2
"Somebody needs to cut de-cock before he is in flow... 

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",1
"Cocks off again.

Cocks on fire today.

Can't beat the cock today.

Are the dugout guys doing it intentionally?",4
Kohli >>>>> Rohit,-6
Ishan(1+k) will bat @ 4 then,3
Rohit remembered he forgot to wish koach,13
"I am a big Rohit fan, but I wished him to come at 4 today and Ishan at 1. Qdk + Indian Qdk have been so good together",5
Now Shane Warne will tweet that It should be out if its hitting the wicket there's no umpires call blah blah blah,-2

Unless he can concentrate on fitness not sure he can reverse the fortunes",-4
"Shastri, Gavaskar and Manjrekar together in the box for a Mumbai game. Wouldn’t that be something? 😍",4
"QDK used to pee his pants when he faced Ash in that 2015 series. He even said that by not being picked to play the test series , his career was saved. But the way he has evolved and even scored a 100 against him in India is a hallmark of a great Player. He'll be a legend by the time he ends of his 20s which looks like a long way from his face.",7
Feelin thoda sad IPL is bout to end and schls will restart soon ......,8
Kohli vindicated after Rohit's duck /s,4
"Well, Rohit was shit last IPL too, and still got those 5 centuries immediately after. IPL opener Rohit has never been absolutely devastating so don't buy too much into it.",5
Rabada please a dream spell today,1
That first over so toothless not a single delivery on proper line and length! not giving new baal to Rabada / Anrich ...?,2
Me looking at the MI batting line up: fuck that's deep,4
"I am yet to see a match with good tactical decisions from ""India's Next Captain"". 
He looks clueless af most of the time",5
Shaw looks older than Dhawan! He needs to just shave his head and go with the bald look,3
Sunny G definitely got some foot fetish,6
A true 4D chess by Rohit would be to deliberately lose this match and have two more games to improve his runs in this season,11
Downvoter is a KKR fan!,-3
Rabada is bowling beautifully!,0
Dhawan and rahul/mayank should open for india in LOI S for Aussies tour. There i said it,-2

Decock is playing in different mood xD,4
I thought he was bowled :'(,2
Dadi is here. RIP DC.,11
Dadi kaun hai,1
Inb4 rohit was dropped due to his recent form,5
Actually Rohit has been shit for the last 3 seasons of IPL. He has been averaging under 25 even when he batted in the middle order. But he can get runs for India whenever we want him to. Pre-2013 Rohit only performed in the IPL consistently and not for India. So I don't mind the trade off here.,12
MI playing so much better without Nohit,3
Quinie please play Ashwin carefully 🙏,0
De Kock hitting these balls pretty hard,4
Dadi got a chartered flight from Ambani to fly to Dubai.,3
I am almost sure QDK will get to a century within 50 balls if he doesnt get out.,2

Guess Quinny is thriving under the much better management at MI than he'd ever get close to experiencing with CSA.,3

A south african performing well makes sense here since this is not a knock-out match after all,10
Mumbai have 3 players who've got 400+ runs this tournament and 2 bowlers who've got 20+ wickets. BRUHHH,14
Nehra & Gary should be maligned for selling DeKock to MI when he only cost 2.8cr it was unfair to all teams not only RCB giving DeKock on platter to MI.,12

"Delhi already have three seamers in stoinis rabada and nortje, could have played lamichanne if they wanted another overseas bowler instead of sams",4
I think Ashwin is saving the Mankad for the 2nd playoff(if DC lose today) or the Final. It's his Brahmastra (nuclear option),17
I thought he almost abandoned that delivery.,7
Delhi keeping the finger spinner tradition alive,3
SKY storm incoming.,5

Take that pause again Ash..,13
MI’s batting is scary good.,9
SKY says fuck your pause,14

Good powerplay for us despite the wicket!,7
Nice PP,8
More like booryakumar jhaantav,-12
What a powerplay,7
63 in the PP. DC gonna need a miracle.,4
I've never seen Ashwin pause and not been hit for a boundary that ball,17

"Swanny Hates Ashwin to death. From 2018 Eng tour where he kept saying Ashwin doesn't flights the ball he even complained this to Smriti mandhana, then to his Mankad to Butler to Ashwin's stop and start action. Swanny loathes him 😂😭😂😭",15
Oh man that pause by Sky before launching into both the drives. Was he always this classy or has something changed this year?,5
170+ and game over for DC,2
De Kock is an awesome investment for MI. 40 runs at a brisk pace every time in the bank.,10

It’s incredible how many games we lose in the first 10 overs lol.,5

DC already rekt.,2
Why are the players wearing black arm band today?,2
That's why I was saying for first batting 🤦‍♂️,2

Is Shreyas making these bowling changes based on random fan polls on Twitter?,8
Mandatory wicket after time-out,2
SKY and ishan kishan should get at least a fraction of chances pant has gotten in the Indian team,2

Rohit getting out was a blessing in disguise. Lawl,6
pant bhai wtf??,4

Meh we'd score this in 10 overs,3
Selector will be gutted to see they missed on SKY. Even though he might not able to replacate same form in International tournament but he should be given at least a chance for his approach and his touch in this tournament.,0
Pant fucked up didnt he,3
Qdk's face was sad,2
Shreyas iyer looks so clueless as a captain,-1
Guys upvote if you think paddikal will make it into team India before sky.,-2
"QDK: oh shit!

chris gaffaney: don’t worry fam I gotchu",4
not out please not out,1
Waiting for people to pounce on Pant if this turns out Not Out,5
QDK's reaction though.. don't know what to make of this,5
QdK looked guilty af. So out probably,9
 Howzzat Howzzat Howzzat,3
After online education ads now TCS ads are here to fuck up life of Indian students' family time,5
Just see how QDK reacted. Maybe some knick?,7
Did de kock fake it 😂,12
Decock fucked up with his reaction SMH.,10
"PANT IS A JOKE!!!!

Reviews like its dead out and then isn't sure about the review...",5
lmao shreyas asking SKY,8
Pant please save us,7
Nice and slow😂😂,7
It's an out man,2
Even tho i support rcb we need SRH for MI. No other teams didn’t even came closes.,8
One of the bad decision from Iyer giving only one ovr to Rabada in powerplay. It will surely cost them.,2
"Rock and Roll 

Rock and Roll",6
chup law-re,2
Gloves??,6
3rd ump really said rock and roll,9
Phewwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!,3
"One more time rock and roll

It was the pads lol,2
Pant you dumb duck,4
Fuck,1
Shit De Kock looks nervous,3
Fuck dc,1
It's a 1 way ticket to final from here.No way MI is gonna take this match lightly.I can already see a score above 160.,7
Ffs check the ultra edge. Rock and rolling ain't gonna do shit.,5
Bat hitting pad smh,4
Dugout commentary giving me the creeps,3
"Nice and slow, nice and slow",4
Check Hawkeye bc,1
REVIEWW LOSTTTTTT,3
Iyer went with the emotions,5
IT'S AN OUT,-2
Cmon man thats not out,0
No glove thank fuck,1
230 on the cards bois,2
Qdk with 6000iq brain. Act like he has knicked it when he hadn't,36
Good boi pant!,4
What a shit review.,5
Wtf pant,6
"QDK gave that 'regret look' to trick Delhi into taking the review Lmao

Master-stroke",98
QDK fake reacted to compel DC into taking review,21
Dream11 trolling KKR hard by putting Eion Morgan together with the 4 captains in the ad for Playoffs.,11
De cock looked more frustrated that he missed out to score on that ball than being guilty,4
What's the point of front on spin vision..when you get the same view with ultraedge ....why can't they go to ultra edge first?,4
QDK: *wink wink motherfuckers*,6
That's the closest I've seen a ball passing the bat with ZERO SNICKO,7
"yeahh babbby NICE and SLOW, ohh dadddy Nice and slow💦",6
Why not go with ultra edge in first instance,5
Why didn't they check Hawkeye if it was pad first?,2
Iyer bhai great captaincy,12
Thanks pant,8
Never Trust Pant,5
Pant🤣,5
This loss of review might cost them bad later on.,6
Only Pashchim Pathak should be allowed to say Rock & Roll.,13
de Kock is better than 90% of bollywood,49
I thought that was out looking at QdK's initial reaction and Pant's appeal,7
Lmao de Kock faked so hard we thought he was out.,8
He looked guilty on purpose so that you could waste the review,8
QDK big brained Pant.,5
Pant is such a dumbfuck.,4
"""tactical"" face by QDK to waste DC's review lol",5
From bad to worse for DC!,3
Damn that was so smart by De Kock LOLL,7
quinton looked pretty guilty there!,3
More importantly DC lost the review.,3
QdK is looking sublime today.,5
Gaffney is prepared. Good umpiring,3
*Insert obligatory joke on de Kock*,3
Anything above 160 this team can't chase. Bowling was the only way. :(,3
Iyer took that review out of peer pressure,12
Mental games by QdK. I like it.,11
QDK too good,5
Mind games by de Kock😂,11
Not Pants fault that was extremely close even when we saw it on our screens,4
Great acting by de cock,15
QDK conned a keeper who would have thought.,9
Liar liar Pant on fire.,7
Quin looked guilty there. Lmao. Great acting.,6
Anything above 180 would be a winning score. Right?,3
"If pollard , hardik are in touch today , they could easily score 250

And people thought we have a chance against their real team , we are gonna lose against rcb next",5
I want the team in blue to win,6
That innocent face tricked them,12
If you're going to go to ultra edge anyway why do drama with the other camera angles before?,2
Le De Cock to Pant:Chutiya banaya bada maja aaya!!!,17
"Pants off, nice and slow, nice and slow",2
Not sure Iyer would ever trust Pant again with a review... LOL,13
Is this how it felt to be on the recievng end of peak Australia or at times Current England?,3
There's 1 imposter among us,2
"One rule with pant keeping, never trust his drs decision",4
Gaffney is an elite umpire. He's so spot on,5
"QDK: ""Powerplay done? Alright let's play brain-dead Cricket now""",3
Is this the same MI that played against SRH?,1
Where does the phrase _rock and roll_ in this context exactly come from?,3
QDK doing 200IQ plays here,7
RIP DC now. Umpires are not gonna give out,5
I think de Kock reaction was because he missed the shot and was disappointed. Not to fake anything lol,6
"My guy sky is 31 years old already and ganguly, shastri are saying his time will come.",10
Gaffney is on fire today,4
Altroz-the gold standard car!!😆,3
"All good trying to be innovative, fun stuff. But sticking to the traditional way of bowling your best up front (x2) is what works more often than not, for champion teams.

See: Mumbai Indians",5
"*Rohit gets out on golden duck*

MI: Best Power Play ever!",79
mI bUyS uMpIrEs,5
MI's big game experience and DC's relative lack of it is clearly showing,2
"4D chess from De Kock. DC saw his reaction, reviewed, and lost.",6
De Kock to go big here.,1
"Gaffaney bhai, tu karke aaya hai

T: gaffaney is being a fucking boss",7
"O God, altroz",3
"Btw, seriously, when QDK sighed and looked straight up at the sky right after that .... knowing that he didn't touch it.

He completely faked Pant into that.

Lmao.",95
Dugout commentators have made Altroz into Loltroz,2
Is it possible to stop MI from 5th title?,5
"the secret is, QdK always looks guilty",64
"I thought Sanjay bangar just overacts over the car in dugout, but was watching SS1 Hindi yesterday and the dude wanked on it there too. It was worse in Hindi",5
200+ score incoming.,2
Can we win this,4
Send SKY’s passport to Australia embassy please,4
This is reminding me of 2012 ipl qualifier situation,1
Imagine being an Indian Selector,11
I want someone to love me as much as Swann loves the Golden Altroz.,8
"Ok, RCb's 263 safe or not?",2
Altroz safest hatchback gold standard😍,5
they should use that clip as Altroz ad,2
"Not to often that umpires get due credit, but this dude has been rock solid today. Some close calls, and got both right.",8
I want Delhi to go guns blazing on ball 1. I don't give a fuck if we get bowled out for 120. Just go for it lads and play free.,7
SKY's shot selection is on a different level,6
Normally the clocks go forward during the IPL and I have to get used to games suddenly starting an hour later. This year the clocks have gone back and I have to get used to the games suddenly starting an hour earlier. That's my analysis of the tournament,13
That cut shot by SKY having Kevin Peterson vibes,6
"Swann had a little too much ""coke"" today.",1
"Don't think we have bowled too badly, it's been a really good exhibition of batting so far by MI..",4
"Bruh.

Chris Gaffaney flexing. Didn't flinch for either call.",2
Btw really good umpiring👌🏾👌🏾,4
"MI is like that autralian team back in 2000's that won back to back worldcups... Has one for every role.... crazy bowlers, opening wicket keeper, power hitters, finishers...",11
What more does SKY needs to do to get into the Indian team?,2
What a shot by Sky,2
We need 6 wickets and we needed them 2 overs ago,4
"I really miss Malinga. It would have been too good with him, Boult and Bumrah.",4
"DRS improvement- for caught behind reviews, the bowling team should retain the review if there is a spike shown by snicko, even if it is not from the bat.",2
Laughable that this guy isn't atleast in the Indian squad,1
Smh I thought there was some 5 minute adbreak but my uncle had switched it to start sports 2 by mistake,3
"Lol axar's face

Bas Kar pagle rulaega kya",3
This guy must be playing for Indian team!,2
DC already lost the match,3
MI fucking DC raw.,5
Everytime I see DC in qualifiers I get happy and finally get my hopes up only to be disappointed again,6
PANT trying to do an MS!! LOL... COuldn't lift his heavy leg,6
[deleted],15
De Kock is weaker against spin. Sky is weaker against pace. I wouldn't want to be Iyer right now.,6
"After 50+ games, even I wouldn't be able to praise that crap of a car.

Not blaming Dugout one bit for winging it.",7
Quinton didn't fake. He is disappointed for missing the shot. Not acting to trick them into taking a review ffs,8
Is this a good batting pitch or MI batting extremely well? Cos our bowlers are not bowling that badly,6
Not even a shit ton of dew in second innings can save DC now,3
This is not the DC bowling that has carried them through the tournament if they continue like this they're out,6
Wtf was that umpire chat about?,5
"All aboard the MI tuk tuk train, next stop is Pollard station in the 16th over.",11
and sky will STILL not make his Indian debut.,5
SKY needs to be in the India team!,4
"DC's Mohit Sharma has lost his father, which is why they are wearing the black armbands

-ESPNcricinfo",110
Rohit low-key helped us get a good start by getting out on duck. I wouldn't even say low-key.,102
The way how SKY plays spin alone makes him worthy to get a call in Indian team.,8
I don't see much point continuing watching this... See y'all on Sunday.,6
lmao thanks DC for winning against us the other day. Atleast srh wont fuck us this badly (i hope),6
DC needs a miracle to restrict MI.,3
My YouTube sources have told me that SKY is considering playing for New Zealand.,9
Did QdK bait Pant into taking that review with his reaction? 😂😂😂,7
"God help us, ill believe in you",3
Sky is best at playing spin bowling,2
SKY 💖❣💖❣💖,5
The fuck is that a 6,2
"""we will bowl thenks""",3
"Top edge for six.. yeah, not our day..",7
"Still striking at RR of 10, 220 for sure",5
DC doesn't stand a fucking chance against Mumbai,5

220 or 240?,1

Unnecessary,3

The heck that looked like a clean strike,1
Somewhat related: who are worse: KPop stans or Thala worshippers?,-3
Damn Ash! Didn't expect this from you,2
Finally a wicket,2
Yesssss lets gooooooooo,2

Fuck,1
"Finally man, fuck yes",0
"Dhawan is probably the only player in the Delhi team I'd put money on catching that

Good catch, massive wicket for Delhi. Ashwin was brave to toss it up again and it worked",1
SHIKHAR THIGH SLAP FOR DE KOCK,8
This is what an ideal T20 opener's innings is like. Take a note KL.,6
I stopped following the IPL for the past 2 weeks. How is Rohit hurt for the Australia tour next month and still playing for Mumbai? What am i missing?,4

Sorry guys.",3

"Delhi fans can be confident right now

When Iyer wears a cap sideways that's about to fall down, then you know we're fucked",7
Cock's down no,4
Ethical mind is a very smart bowler.,9
Fuckers here jinxed QdK,6
"slap me like dhawan slaps his thigh, Ash you beauty",5
DeKock ejected prematurely... whats new?,6
Why does he need to go big again when there's already a six in the over ffs,3

"Be honest, the only reason they didn't select Rohit is because of that gorgeous paunch, right?",4
SKY HIGH❤️,3
“Pant fell for de kock” 😏😏😏😏😏,11
No need to take that risk.,4
QDK slows down a lot after PP. could be another blessing in disguise,1
Mini QDK should play 40(23),3
"**7.4** Ashwin to de Kock, OUT, Ashwin has another Mumbai wicket. He is single-handedly keeping them in the contest **78-2**

Q de Kock c Dhawan b Ashwin 40 (25b 5x4 1x6) SR: 160.00",5

Such a shame Ashwin is not in white ball tour for Aus. Kuldeep has been broken by Brother Moen Ali 😞,5
Fuck Bigg Boss!,3
Last thing MI want is Kishan playing some dot balls and invite a risky shot from SKY,4
40(25) > 50(40),11
"It’s VERY hard to know which domestic Indian players will actually succeed in the IPL. Many domestic superstars are really bad in the IPL. Before being picked for MI, SKY didn’t have a domestic record  among the best and neither was he an exceptional performer for KKR. Whether MI saw some exceptional talent in him or whether he developed after joining MI is anyone’s guess. But it’s obviously MI’s win.",13
Just what the doctor ordered.,1
Salman and his smug face,8
"QDK gets out 
Relax's for a second realise Ishan Pandya and Pollard left 
Cries in corner",19
Only need 160 to win against DC. So about 80 to get from 12 overs. Seems doable.,8
Now desi QDK will hit,7
"Bruh, when QDK and SKY are both in top form .... I think MI can drop a 250 burger on DC at this rate. Goddamn.

Edit: QdK ..... too aggressive lol.",4
As if a wicket is gonna hurt MI. Pfft.,7
Pant spreading his legs too far,3
Qdk gone qdk lite in,9
Asswin is lazy in his celebrations too. Is this guy always in energy saving mode?,10
Ishan kishan no dots please,1
QdK has to take some less risk if the boundary has already come in over,6
Is there any sane person who gives a fuck about Bigg Boss airing 24x7?,7
Big respecc to Ashwin for rediscovering himself in a format where offies like him generally struggle,7
"Can never be too happy after getting a wicket of a MI batsman, one after another only aggressive batsmen will come.",7
Pls god,6
Pant lite batting in front of Pant,8
QDK after seeing SKY’s six was like “hey I wanna do that too!”,10
De Kock is out? Arrest MI for indecent exposure!,6
"QDK taking on Ashwin? wouldn't have mind him trying that against Axar, SKY was batting well against Ashwin, should have taken single.",4
"Next over should be a wicket taking fast bowler. 

But we will see Sams.",4
confuse if I should laugh on the wicket or cry because every other batsman is in monster form in MI. Wicket doesn't change the any thing.,6
QDK lite in for QDK,8
Ishan don’t repeat last game’s play.,3
"Apart from the 2017 champions trophy, Ashwin has always performed in big games, i think",7
De Kock wicket was always coming,2
Only Dhawan's batting can save DC now,9
Pant with his U19 team's captain.,6
RR below 10 fuck,2
"* QdK out *

MI: There is another",18
are people here asking sky to be included for the loi or test matches? what are his domestic stats?,5
How much did rohit score?,2
Kishan plays so low he's always in a great position to hit long shots. Dude must squat a lot.,3
Can we restrict MI to bw 160-180,9
Kishan I beg you not to play dot balls. Keep it ticking,4
Sandeep Sharma is selling sariya to Pant again,4
"nortje and Rabada in for the pressure, sams could work too with his inswingers maybe?",6
Whats par here?,5
"Pant called an Emergency meeting asking to vote out De **Cock**. 

__De **Cock** was not the imposter__",3
"Is Rohit injured today? 

Can't see him on the field..",3
"Swann: ""Mi skipper will be disappointed of QDK""

Umm... I don't think so swanny",8
Those projected scores are wild for DC,5
Sky is the most dangerous batsman in this MI lineup imo.,1
[deleted],4
Dhoni is still keeping csk relevant in ^ads,3
I can even call Iyer’s chutiya captaincy now.,2
India definitely need a big match player now if we want to win big matches. Someone like Yuvraj or Gambhir. While Virat and Rohit are ofcourse batting legends but they definitely have a not so good record in knock out games.,9
"Fun fact - ishan kishan captained pant, khaleel, sundar, mavi in u19 wc",16
I have a feeling Nortje will trouble SKY,2
"2008:Rr

"26 sixes in 12 matches!!! 


What a tiny legend!!",10
Sams redemption arc??,2
A wicket. Only Pollard and Hardik yet to come in.,4
"QDK faking the nick was too obvious or subtle enough. Not watching since at work hence asking.

ICC has brought in rules pertaining to faking. However they are with respect to fielding. This may lead to a debate.",10
Why the fuck is Zomato charging ₹100 as delivery + packaging charges on a ₹300 order?,11

I am thinking it is for RCB, if SRH is knocked out by an odd super star performance this year",8
"Saving Rabada and Nortje for Pollard and Pandya, but here SKY might take the game away from you and then it'd be too late.",4
"That's the fucking thing with MI. Any other team and you'd think that getting a wicket will stop the flow of runs for at least 1-2 overs. But not with this side. Get 1, they keep coming. Get 2, they keep coming. Get 3 and thatll be enough right? Watch the run rate go fucking UP instead with Pandya Pollard batting.

It's like the terminator, truly scary stuff",183
Dhawan og regardless of results,3
Mumbai have no confidence in protecting a score where lies Delhi’s chance.,1
Not sure if we will see 30 (30) Ishan Kishan today or 75 (30) Ishan Kishan,8
Lovely to see a female head coach for such a big IPL franchise.,9
"Rohit's poor run with bat continues.

This IPL it has been lackluster Koach and NoHit",10
"Pant is completely untrustworthy as a keeper with his idiotic reviews and as a batsman with his one handed ridiculous shots. 

He will likely never play for India and Delhi would do well to trade him away. What a dummy. 

Although knowing Delhi's luck, he'll probably hit form against Delhi next time around.",12
"Come on guys! Let's keep smashing and get to ~140 or so by 15th over.

Give our closers some room to smash us to 200+!",8

Ashwin is hanging around so I don't want to give too much info!! LOL,14

"Mahela saying, ""Ashwin's near so don't wanna give too much information""

Lol....",45
Never thought I’d say this but Rohit is a liability to this MI team now,9

"Did Mahela say ""Ashwin is hovering around, I don't want to give too much info""",112
every IPL team with MI is like “you versus the guy she told you not to worry about”,15
I hope we don't give Krunal one of his promotions today. He's better off in the 16-20 phase.,7
How beautifully does sky plays ?,5
Mahela afraid of Ashwin overhearing him. Ethical Mind is offended.,62
DC be like gift pakad.,8
"Krunal getting ready to bat next, i don't like that.",8
Lmao Karthik had to repeat his joke. Love it,41
Is Hardik Pandya a Cricketer aspiring to be an Instagram model?,44
Keep bowling short and wide mate. Thanks definitely gonna work,9
Iyer does not get the concept of set batsman will destroy Rabada Nortje remaining overs no matter how late he holds onto them.,15
"You really have to be batshit insane to rate Kishan over Pant. Like there's no way you can have that opinion when you have reasonable cricketing knowledge ""OR"" an idea about the staggering gap in their stats.",6
"Ashwin is hovering around so I don't want to give much information!!! 

- Mahela Jayawardhne",72
We need more Sanga-Mahela banter in our lives.,41
Swanny's on too many uppers rn,6
"Mahela J is hardly mentioned when talking about MI's success, Its always Malinga/Rohit/SKY/pollard/bumrah/hardik.",19
Sky scary,10
Send SKY passport for Aus visa processing now,50
Awkward chat with mahela there lol,13
Mumbai showing how to exploit other teams with deep batting lineup just like Ambani exploits other business with deep pocket !,5
"SKY having no problems, I see.",3
So glad Jayawardene is still involved in the ipl. Loved the sri lankan team he was a part of.,13
"Just came here, Rohit got out on his first ball and may I ask why is he still playing after his bad record this season.",5
"Someone on cricbuzz:

Lol. He does know that DC staff are watching the match and can relay the info later on, right?",20
"MI is like Hydra, take a wicket and more wicked demon comes out.",12
"However it happens there has to be an RCB vs MI match, just to see Koach and NoHit together at the toss. Those few seconds will be worth SRH getting eliminated. And I am supporting SRH this year.",12

Pretty sure Mahela made Karthik repeat his joke.,16
Sunny g is a big fan of mahela,7
SKY oof,4
"Have to say, MI looking like they want to win the title. Great strategy here to just go for it. One 40(25) batsman gets out, no prob. We have another 42(26) guy at the crease",15
Ashwin ethical spy!,11

There is always a good coach.",25

What is this Ethical Mind joke related to Ashwin?,3
*Do your Chhinaal-panti. Instagram reels.,7

MI steamrolling.,12
Did anyone noticed the 🤰 glow on Iyer's face?,10
"The only thing I watch the Delhi matches for is how stupid Iyer is now and he never disappoints. 

What a consistent performer!",7
SKY is 30? Crikey. One of those players who give the impression they are in their mid 20s because they are always talked about as prospects.,11
[deleted],27
Mahela just had to RIP Sanga there 😂,6
"MI when they loose a wicket : Oh no

Anyway",224
Irony is SKY plays like Virat Kohli lol,18
It is a disgrace Ashwin isn’t in the Indian team for limited overs Cricket.,9
Kohli should learn from SKY on how to bat in middle over,-3
"Man getting head.


Pant: Yeh Mai kar leta hoon aap Dream 11 team banaiye!






Head as in coin toss you weirdos!",1
Swanny Chillin on his phone lol,6
I wouldn't mind seeing someone like a Pollard coming in during the middle overs to keep the spinners on their toes.,5
Those fans dancing😂😂😂,8
"Pant has to bat at the similar stage Hardik comes at. Stoinis should come over him. Stoinis can do what he is doing, but what Pant does at the death freely no one can.",7
"Hopefully Kishan and SKY can hold until the 13-15th overs, and give Hardik and Pollard a great foundation to smash on.",8
What does Dhawan's celebration mean?,8
DC getting murdered. In the gaps.,2
Ian Bishop just said sunny bhai lol,6
Anything above 165 with MI bowling attach will be next to impossible for DC no matter how much JEW is on ground.,7
MI should score more than 220 so that Pant can score a century today.,5
Only thing left to watch is Stoinis over in this game. But trust Iyer to give him an over.,7
Similarly between Uttappa and suryakumar. Both didn't get selected when they were in prime form,12
Last 4 overs: 30/1,1
"You really have to be batshit insane to rate Muralitharan over Ramesh Powar. Like there's no way you can have that opinion when you have reasonable cricketing knowledge ""OR"" an idea about the staggering gap in their stats.",11
they’re keeping DC fielders real busy lmao,7
"Sometimes these long breaks make me think ""Maybe script writers are making some changes according to the TRP"" 😂",9

"6 overs is Rabada Nortje left.

Has to be next over!",2
Pant speaks too much,7
Surya could be Indian Micheal Hussey. Debut late in career but doing extraordinary well. Many would say Iftikhar Ahmed is new Saeed Ajmal after his Fifer against Zimbabwe. You never know the future do you? 🌝,11
Decent over for DC,5
Just play out this over please. No wickets,6
Damn..this was the first over without a boundary. MI way ahead right now,4
"Bowlers are not taking wickets.

DC fans: Hmm.. Lets shit on Captain",9
"You really have to be batshit insane to rate Glenn  Mcgrath over Vinay Kumar. Like there's no way you can have that opinion when you have reasonable cricketing knowledge ""OR"" an idea about the staggering gap in their stats.",11
We are one bad spinner over away from a Stoinis over.,4
Well this sub loves to shit on Iyer's decisions but he did well to drag back MI in the last 5 overs while still preserving Rabada's and Nortje's overs for the bigger fish.,8
Imagine if premier league players had to dance to jio dhan dhana dhan,10
Don't worry guys south african bumrah is here,3
Sanjay bang-her,9
Mumbai Indian is so mature and composed in their batting they at least score a boundary per over which  makes run rate so stable.,7
Nohit has been a liability for MI at least this season.,3
is this what good middle over batting looks like?,6
[deleted],10
So we all virgins fucked after IPL and have to wait for Aus tour huh,3
Disheartening from DC.,0
[deleted],6
6 overs of Nortje and Rabada left for the last 10. Think MI can get another 90 odd here.,14
Mumbai should just endorse the meme and rename themselves to vada mumbai,26

When I'm not on R/cricket delhi has won. Adios everyone,5
Shreyas needs to be more aggressive. Bowl Rabada immediately after the wicket fell instead of waiting 3 overs and allowing them easy rebuild. SRH held MI back by getting wickets in clumps.,3
"Rabada is ever so often just discarded but he is such a good bowler, doesnt get enough respect as Archer, Bumrah",5
everyone retire everyone goes out due to new laws. But Rajiv shukla stays,7
Rohit can get away with his average performances due to good team and probably captaincy.,8

[deleted],1
"MI in first 7 overs: 71/1

MI in next 7 overs: 37/3",7
With Bumrah chasing will always be difficult. Rohit will hold him back to the end of the Innings.,1
RCB please beat SRH. I am fine with new winner if we don't win,2
"In all seriousness, I think mi will whack remaining 6 overs. I predict score around 170👍🏽",3
"I hope Delhi doesn't bottle this now, should try to restrict 170 now",2
"Jeez, they’re taking this so seriously",1
Time to clean them up KG,3
"37-3 in last 7

71-1 in first 7",3
"Good innings from Ishan Kishan today.

Batted out the session & survived. Let's see how he plays after Tea",1
"MI fans ranting like RCB atm.

But they still have good finishers",7
Hardik motivating krunal,0
 For once the right call to bowl Rabada now!!,2
I'd have kept rabada for hardik tbh,1
Iyer wants to kill the game in this over or what,2
"Ah, the pregnancy glow back on our boi Iyer! ☺️",5
My perfect IPL: delhi beat mi -> rcb beat srh-> rcb beat mi -> delhi beat Rcb in super over,1
They will go big in the 1 over left for Axar because both are left handed,1
u/BalaatkariBaba can I kiss u?,-1
Rohit sharma unironically making this team worse,8
"Yes 2020, one DC vs RCB final please and thank you.",1
"160 is still the make or break number. Higher, impossible for DC to chase.",1
Does sextillion 7th power bot work?,2
Rahane will be the Achilles heel of the chase.,1
"Everyone saying SRH Vs MI 

So it is then in Qualifier 2",2
"Pollard vs Ashwin (T20s) - 

45 balls

72 runs

Five dismissals

"Krunal should start hitting, even NCN can bat",3
That was a catch,3
"MI fans panicking!

RCB fans: First time?",7
Love how Brett lee and Sanjay just ignored swannie and continued,3
Nokiaaaaa 😒,7
I left for an hour and what the fuck,2
Lmao that was a catch,1
That was tactical. We want discount Pandya there for few more overs.,2
"Kishan could have just been kept the opener tbh , was no need for rohit",4
Nortje doesn't want to give Rabada wickets /a,5
Idk what changed but these days wickets don't fall just after the timeout. Initially when timeout was introduced there were way many instances of batsman getting out in next over after timeout.,1
When’s the last time Krunal played a good innings,0
[deleted],2
IshKish seems to be costing this match as well like last one,1
Rabada told him to catch the ball but fielder ne No-kia,10
That slide lmao. Good effort tho.,4
Swanny openly letching at Ricky calling him a hot dinner he wants to gobble up,2
Was that Hardik who took charge of the Mumbai huddle?,1
Fuck we needed that 4. Been a while.,3

Good attempt anyway,2
Stop trying to attack Rabada ffs,2

Threw the kishan sink at that one!,8
[deleted],2
Rabada getting smeshed.,5
Man that should've been caught,4
For fucks sake,4
Swann just let Sanjay talk . So irritating hearing him constantly interrupt him,3
Nortje should’ve caught that,11
My cousin's have made a pact to dance on every 6 & 4,17
Why would you bowl short KG wtf,2
"Don't mind either Batsman going at it now.

Don't see DC chasing this tbh,7
"On one hand we have cricketers advertising for mutual funds, betting, gambling, and alcohol ads disguised as music ads and then we have Kane Williamson advertising apples! Good lad.",14
Kishan spinning more than Ashwin,8
Ishan with the most sixes this season now. What a lad,11
Rabada going wicket less for the 2nd time?,0
What is Dedh footiya doing in the MI dressing room chilling with Rahul Chahar?,3
Smacking RABADA for 14! GAME ON,2
"Man, Kishan looked ready to strike. That was a beaut",2
"Even after getting hit twice, Rabada still bowled short. Genius level thinking",4
DC fans out here thinking they have a chance to contain them yet ;-;,1
Kishan was the captain of the under 19 team that Pant was in. Where did it go wrong that Kishan went uncapped while Pant got two years of experience in international cricket?,11
Not particularly clever from Rabada bowling short to Kishan in his arc,4
"The minute I stopped watching they lost 3 wickets, the second I tuned back in Ishan makes it look like he is batting on 50 ffs",4
\#sextillion7thpower,4
"5 overs - should be minimum 60 runs, should reach 180",3
But I like Ishan the opener 🙏,3
swanny becoming the new Neesham for this sub,4
Turns out Instagram reels gave me cancer,4
DC can chase anything below 175,2
Rabada kept bowling short and hoped for a wicket and gave 2 boundaries.Idk what he was thinkin,2
Bowl Nortje this over!,2
u/sextillion7thpowerbot,4
Sextillion7thpower 6 of the match.,5
Ashwin knocking hard on the door to national selection. Man's still got it in white ball cricket,3
Kishan finally beats samson on the sixes chart,3
Whose ugly hoick is more attractive: Kishan’s or Pant’s?,2
Open with Ishan,3
No way Rohit drops down the order even in the next game. This is his way of proving his fitness for the upcoming Aus series,2
MI will score atleast 170. If not I will eat Uthappa with 4 chillies!,7
Bruh Pant has been flickering the lights ever since that ad only,5
"I like this back and forth between ball and bat, continuous short deliveries challenging the batsman. One mistake and it's a wicket, one connect and a six. Also props to Rabada for not backing down even after that six",2
Its already so stressful MI pls dont choke.  Josh app FUCKOFFFFF,8
Prayer dadi in the stadium🙏,2
Krunal needs some #sextillion7thpower now,7
These mumbai batsmen are performing infront of their competitors kishan-pant and surya-shreyas.,5
Iyer is doing some high gambling right now if it doesn't work they are fucked,6
[deleted],10
Nortje please little bit of magic,4
Legit Sunny G must have had an orgasm after Ishan Kishan's six,6
Tbh Ishan should open,7
Last over might be by Stoinis. See this going above 180,5
"Ashwin after 4-0-29-3

Fuck it I can afford to give away 10-15 runs in the field",12
Stoinis will bowl 20th over I guess,5
Has Rabada forgotten how to bowl yorkers?,3
Rohit Sharma totally useless,0
What a shot. Kudos,6
Kishan taking on these two bowlers is so impressive!,2
Rabada has turned into Kabada in the last few games.,3
One over of spin or Stoinis left gives me some hope.,2
Few minutes ago someone was pointing out ishan for bad form... Here we go,6
Retarded camera work.,2
Kishan has looked so good this year,2
Rabada hasn’t been as good with his lengths as he was during the first half of the tournament,2
Damn what a shot,2
Why are they bowling into Kishan... he's very strong there,2
Bruh Ashwin has already bowled his quota. Why is he not out of the field chilling in his shorts yet?,4
the next crop of Indian opening batsmen is so classy,2
Why is Warne's fap material not bowling yet?,2
[removed],0
Who tf are these people in the stadium besides the team and media? I thought there weren’t supposed to be any fans at all,6
Getting close to that 160 now!,1
This is MI for you they play attacking cricket everytime no matter what is the situation.Look neatly they try to hit atleast one boundary per over but they can do this because they have Pollard and Pandya at the back and a good bowling line up which can defend any score.,2
"Nortje has been the find of the Tournament for me. DDP, Bishnoi also excellent but Nortje has been extremely good for us",5
Yorker dug out in the gap WHAT?!,3
I cannot imagine Mi's strategy being to tuk tuk the spinners and then smash the SA pacers,7
We back on boys!,0
Make him play offside you morons,1
Should've waited a little before bringing out KG and Nortje,1
Why is DC punishing ashwin by posting him at the boundary line?,3
"Gonna call it: 184 for MI, and DC will chase that down.

EDIT: fourteen short in my estimation. And Boult has just taken Rahane. I deserve all the downvotes for daring to dream.",0
"Ahh yes, let's bowl some full tosses and short balls.",3
"*wicketkeeper batsman scores more than 20 @ > 100 SR*


Fuck you Rishab Pant!!!",8
Nice Kishan.,3
Sams and Stoinis overs might go for a lot,1
"Bruh Pant this is a wake up call, Look at Ishan. He might be up for consideration very soon.",5
goes and cries in corner,9
Such a shame Ishan Kishan is not in Indian team. 😞,1
Pant making sad noises seeing a young and FIT Indian wicket keeper scoring runs.,9
Bc kishan har ball pe chakka maarne ki try kyu kar rha he yar,2
Now imagine Hardik at the other end!,9
185-190 possible if fuckboi fires,5
Guys Rabada yet to take a wicket today. It is a bad omen for DC.,4
"Christmas from South Africa coming early for Kishan.

Both Rabada and Nortje bowling tripe to him.",6
Iyer saving axar's last for Hardik?,2
Kishan is so good man. I guess playing video games till 4 at night really helps you,12
MI are too fuckin strong mahn,3
Feel bad for Rabada n Nortje,2
Yessssssss maro,0
Imagine Krunal hitting you for a 6,2
I was afraid of nokia but it is also destructible,2
That's the way boyz! Fight!,3
That white smoke is so Vaticanesque,3
Their best two pacers getting taken down wtf,5
Bc still 200 padhenge,2
Krunal to channel his inner Pandya,8
"Here's an idea lads, stop bowling short balls bc they're going for 6 repeatedly",2
Wtf that's huge,3
Finally a competitive Delhi v Mumbai game,3
"lappe connect ho rahe hai behenchod, kya pace hai",6
Yo Delhi can yall stop now,7
"Guys, there are many more MI chicks. Are common people allowed now?",12
Never would've thought Ishan Kishan would be the best Indian wicketkeeper-batsman in the IPL this year,54
FFS. Stop bowling short. This is not the pitch,4
MI really took DC being called best bowling attack to heart,15
Krunal Pandya saw that bouncer coming even before Nokia started his runup,8
Swanny is MI pro guy,7
Fuck mi depth is next level . Someone always performs,6
Absolute garbage bowling,4
Why tf is everyone bowling short n getting smashed,6
Is it just me or the wire from mid wicket cam during replays is too irritating?,4
This is really good for MI. Hardik can absolutely take down Stoinis and Sams,3
"wtf god hates us Delhi please have some mercy

I'm dead inside",4
"Iyer hasn't been good as a Captain , could have won a couple more in the league stage",5
"When Strike bowlers getting belted, Stoin is the man to call/s   Edit- You heard it here first folks",3
Who would have thought Ishan kishan would be top on most sixes tally ahead of pollard. pandya abd,25
A Pandya is a Pandya,9
Nokia's fast pace boon or curse?,8
"Ambani in Time-out : ""Alright, kisko kisko Mercedes mangta hai ?""

T: ""Who all needs Mercedes ?""",52
"If you bowling short, bowl outside off with the bigger ground surely!",8
Eesh keesh has had a very good ipl,9
32 off the last 2 overs,12
Try some variations ffs,8
Again a short ball lmao,6
"MI too OP. Just 3 overs ago, commentators were saying MI would do well to score 160+.",8
Mumbai gonna show delhi what 12.2 death overs run rate looks like,6
Kishan was like “oop lemme just hit that for a four real quick”,3
Easy 200 if fuccboi is in his zone today,5
So 200 still very much possible,5
"My God, this kid is playing a fucking blinder here",4
Iyer's striker bowlers going for Rons. What next now?,0
Cmon this isn't even the batsman Pandya,3
Toying,3
Josh app ad are so cringey,5
Kissan Jam what a shot,2
"14 of Rabada
18 of Nokia.

Ashwin bowled out.

We got this fam.",4
Captain clueless is back bois,1
"Delhi bowlers bowling short and back of a length: get hit for boundaries

Delhi bowlers: I'm gonna keep bowling short",1
Did RCB exhange their bowling attack with DC ?,1
Bc bhakk yar. What a shitshow. Bowl stoinis ab aur kya,0
"Bruh, last two overs 30 runs",2
Lol 190 is on the cards now,2
When MIs management asks for intent from players... They fkin mean it...,7
Kishan is in top 5 scorers in this IPL after missing 3 matches...,4
They are going to go for it every single  now. 22 balls to go...,1
Aight but Stoinis does bowl a good 20th over,3
They are alternating between exquisite timing and negative timing,1
"What is going on XD.

The strike bowlers getting smashed will really hurt DC's morale.",2
Ok. Now they’ll hit it or get out.,3
Fucking Josh ads are hard mode for nnn,1
DC's main players are Indians and South Africans so choking in playoffs is expected.,5
Hardik-gaali-dugout anyone ?,2
"Death overs exist!

MI batsmen: *This is free real estate*",3
PANT WAKE UP see him PLAY. He could take your spot.,12
150.7kmph... just a dab to four,8
Can we open with Nortje? When Trent gets a wicket in the first over at least we won’t have to bring in that useless Shreyas and actually have a proper “opening” partnership.,2
Lmao Pandya,2
All those people cheering when mumbai was playing like rcb can't see them now can i,0
I really want to punch that kid from whitehatjr.,5
Why tf does Iyer always look so clueless geez have a stronger face and body language,6
Hardick wtf.,5
200 BACK ON THE MENU LADS,2
Wow this is an amazing counter attack,4
Both rabada  and nortje short ball plan didn't work,4
That over has put MI back on track somewhat.,2
Every ball is a free hit from now on for Krunal.,3
Looks like DC is going to meet RCB in Q2.. No way they are chasing ~200,3
Highly doubt if DC can chase this with MI bowling attack,8
Just bowl the slow balls ffs,3
Fy pandya,5
Both Rabada and Nortje have picked a great time to enroll into the famed Dinda academy.,10
Stoinis (⊙_ʖ⊙)_/¯,3
Stoinks,2
whahahahahah,2
Ponting told Rabada and Nortje to bang the ball in middle of pitch. It's his fault. 😞,7
Stoinis for his share of pitai ?,3
why are delhi capitals palyers wearing black arm bands?,5
Why the fuck stoinis is always picking wickets when he should not,9
For fucks sake,6
Perfect time for hardik to come in,7
Stoinis = strike bowler,7
Brother helping brother,4
"Smacks Nokia

Gets out to fucking Stoinis",13
u/singhsrb - talk nah,4
Lol stoinis magic again??,3
I wish we had 4 retentions and 5 RTMs.,4
I'm seeing 180 on the cards atleast. I just hope DC opening batsman are not walking wicket in the first over today. But knowing DC i'm pretty sure 6 over 24-2 is on the card.,5
What did hardik do?,2
Stonkis,2
Stoin makes things happen™,3
Ineffable,1
Ofcourse they smack both Nortje and Rabada after nurdling Sams around,5
Ishan fucking up both Rabada and Nokia aaaahhhhhhh,3
Right Pandya at crease at the right time. Not sad,4
Perfect time for Hardik to come in,5
"Among all the empty cricket phrases, *expressing yourself* is the one I hate the most. Wtf does it even mean? You want Krunal to spontaneously start a Gujarati rap to express himself?",4
Og pandya is in bois.,8
Hardik playing with the camera is basically POV Rohit Sharma grabbing vadapav,3
So all wicketkeeper batsman in IPL>>>>Pant,8
Now DC are in trouble,3
Here the the Love Machine Fuccboi™❤️💦,1
Iyer needs to pull up his body language during such phases. He’s barely talking to his bowlers,4
Stoinis again being the lucky charm for DC,4
Hardik is so horny for attention he is literally grinding the camera at this point,2
"Overs 10-14 , 15 Runs 2 wickets. That changed the game.",2
"Stoinis : Look at me, I'm the strike bowler now",2
Without Swann dug out is so much better.,2
Abbbe krunal idiot,2
Sasta 3d getting a wicket first ball,3
"Looking at Kishan bat this season -

Pant: *Chuckles* I AM IN DANGER",5
Fucboi on now,2
Guys my mom pointed this out but doesnt ashwin look a little weird as of late? Has he started drinking a lot? Ik somethings wrong but i cant pin point it. Does anyone else feel the same?,2
This might be a wicket they didn't want..,3
Always rated Stoinis,2
Sams is everywhere lol,1
Oh no this means another Stoinis over!,0
Ok bring the hardick,3
"MI is too OP.

Change my mind.",3
Aight fuckboi in,3
Stonks,2
"Don't mind that innings. Sparked us into life.

Over to you Hardik.",3
Thats what happens when u dont bang it short every ball,3
Yup.. these surfaces are definitely suiting the medium pacers with variations rather than the express quicks. Hope that gives SRH an advantage..,1
Inb4 Stoinis fucks us over,5
Lmao I called it correct jokingly,3
The other Pandya is going to abuse Stoinis now,5
 Stoinis > Rabada Confirmed,6
"Stoinis lucky he is slow.

The lack of pace on that is why he got a wicket instead of getting carted for a six",4
4 overs... either 50 or 30.... that'll sum up the match...,3
"Pandya lite out

Pandya mega incoming",8
Well they just took down DCs premiere quicks for 32 in 2.  Fancy DC to do the same to Bumrah and Boult?,3
"Iyyer is like, if good bowlers are going to shit then I'll bowler stoinis, kya pata confusion me wicket nikal jaaye",6
"Imagine hardick coming after 5 wickers , RCB would change their name to Bangalore Indians for batting depth like this",10
"Risk : Hitting the deck at 145kmph

Reward : wide outside off @120kmph",12
Krunal has literally done nothing this season apart from bashing Sid Kaul,5
Keep going hard off Stoinis. He's capable of going for 20 an over,4
"**16.1** Stoinis to KH Pandya, OUT, wide length ball, and he does well to drag this out of his reach. Pandya looks to drive it over extra cover, but this goes off the toe end as he has a long way to reach. Caught at deep point. Golden arm eh **140-5**

KH Pandya c Sams b Stoinis 13 (10b 0x4 1x6) SR: 130.00",3
Mumbai really don't have a shortage of capable batsmen.....,10
Jacqueline Josh ad is so cringe wtf!,10
PANDYA INNN,2
Shit gets wickets,1
Krunal has been largely useless with the bat outside of 1 or 2 innings,9
"Good captaincy, Iyer! if Rohit or Dhoni did some unconventional bowling change and got wicket, they would have been praised.",19
Stoinis just crushed feeble pandya with his thicc biceps,7
I'm a simple guy. I just want Pant to win the match for DC :(,13
That Jacqueline chick is hot...,5
As an Indian national cricket team fan I want Hardik to succeed. We don't have good hitter like him now.,6
Take notes mi bowlers. Bowl wide to the larger side,4
Last batsman,2
"Here is F U C C B O I

The 'West Indian' Indian",10
"Krunal Pandya gets out : 'Happy noises!'
Hardik Pandya enters : 'Panicccccc!'",18
How did they not cross?,2
As a DC fan not sure if I'm happy or sad about this wicket,2
[deleted],8
"This left arm Boost drinking pacer just bowled Koach, but Koach won't take him to Australia because Koach has ego problems.",2
"LOL, why Dream 11 is showing KKR in the advt of the playoff?",2
Stoinis the golden arm,3
Fuckboi and Fuckboi lite,10
The best results in the context of watching some good rivalry would be Mumbai losing this and Bangalore winning tmrw to give us an Rcb vs Mumbai knockout match,1
Does Sams bowl at 140’s ?,2
"Ishan and Hardick still at the crease for last 4 overs. Only 2 overs of Nokia and Rabada.

Dorime. 🙏🏻",4
190,1
"Incredible that MI keeps dominating, despite carrying a specialist opener who averages like 24 in the last 4 seasons.",4
"Fuccbois on the crease. If they play 20, 180+ possible",1
"Smash Rabada and Nortje, lose wickets to Ashwin and Stoinis, now that is a unique strategy",2
"SmallPeePee Pandya bro out.

BigPeePee Pandya bro In",7
Going by current form I would've trusted us to get 190 with Pollard in there. Hardik has been blowing hot and cold this season.,3
"I hope Rabada or Nortje bowl the 18th over from here and the weakest link bowls 20th.

It’s so obvious but Iyer is stupid.",6
"Bruh what is this belting Nortje, Rabada. Mistiming Stoinis cant make this up",9
With all people blaming Rohit and Pant for their fitness. Mind you working as a waiter serving to Ashwin in Dubai. He has eaten 8 Idlis and 3 Dosas before match today and you see the result. I rest my case 😊,8
Stoinis being more economical than rabada and nokia wtf,2
foreshadowing cinematography?,4
Big dick stoinis to Hardick :),3
Bc batting line up is like a never ending snake. Star player after star player,4
Rohit's vada pav partner,1
It'll be a psychological win if we keep them below 190,1
Australian fuckboi vs westindian fuckboi. Lets have at it!,7
Why doesn't Lamichhane play?,5
Thats a two Hardik,1
Can we chase this guys w Bumrah and Boult at the other side,3
How do you not hit that for 4 Hardik,2
Ipl trophy bis fat and ugly....,3
Can anyone tell me what's written on the cup?,2
Missed out on a pie,2
Fuck me. Stoinis getting away with a quiet over in the death.,8
Hardik missed out there. Freebie bc,3
"Shreyas has been great for dc, but he literally looks like he is crying at times while captaining on the field",3
Coz of my slow stream this thread giving me spoilers of match.,2
Rohit and the trophy. Script writers are foreshadowing.,3
Looks like bowling slower cutter on this wkt is a good option. Pace will go,2
Next over who?,1
We need 6,3
Future Indian Captain: Rahul>Iyer,8
180 at least to be competitive,3
"Ipl trophy looks like a bra 

Shittiest one till date imo",6
"Guys, does vada pav with chilly taste better than Uthappa with chilly?",4
MI bowlers better be watching this. Pace off.,4
What is hardick chanting to himself lol,6
I just want Pant to cross 38 today,3
"When ugly shots go for runs it hurts the soul of the opponent, if you're gonna hit us then do it elegantly pls",5

Thala Pant,9
"Krunal is what an utility Player is. Always ready to put his hand up.

Maybe not skilled  enough to make it to the international side, but good enough to make it in the Top IPL side!",27

/s",15
"Knee high full toss at military medium pace and Pandya flicks it for a single.

Stoinis' Guardian angel working overtime today",5
What an over 🔥🔥,3
They really should just have Hardik open with De Kock every time. For no other reason than their names.,6
Is Ashwin still on the field or up to his old tricks again?,4
Sams fielding great,4
"Stoinis bowling a good over, what?",3
"Rabada went for 15 and Stoinis for 5, what the fuck",7
what a brilliant over by Stoinis!! Take the fucking pace off and Mumbai chokes,4
Well stoinis was the brake I never thought was possible,8
This is so below par,2
[removed],-2
"Lol, absolute boss over by Stoinis",10
"All Attention was on SKY, Pollard etc... Meanwhile Kishan has been quite amazing this season playing aggressive as well as anchoring and trying to stay till the end.
Excellent stuff.",5
5 run 17th over. Iyer missed a trick not bowling Stoinis earlier,2
Has pant ever got any drs right ?,11
Don’t bowl Stoinis another over no matter what.,12
Atleast mumbai will cross 160 which mahela talked about,2
Hulkmania is the best mania,1
I can safely say one blue team will qualify today.,2
Stoinis saving our ass once again,3
Stoinks,3
Pollard Krunal Same initials pollard hardik same country hardik krunal same mom,5
Why is Stoinis a fuckboi? He’s never said anything,4
Yh mate I dont think hardik cares about singles,4
"Stoinis has been really good with his bowling this tournament, should have bowled more by Iyer..",0
Got away with that one Iyer,1
Can't fucking believe how good a death bowler Stoinis has turned out to be!,7
RCB fans must be fuming seeing pie chucker Stoinis bowling well for DC,0
LESS GO STOINIS,2
[deleted],4
"Well at least Simon ""Pollard has a great FC record"" Doull and Harsha will now stop saying that Pollard should bat up higher",1
Mumbai even after losing their way have the perfect platform. What a team yar. Itni depth.,3
Just tuned in. Ashwin what a legend!! Shame he's not in ICT,2
Bowling Stoinis might make more sense to Kishan than either of the Saffer quickies,3
Why did we not retain Stoinis ffs!😤😤,2
"Stoinis has been a very good buy for us. All things considered. 2 Match Winning Knocks, 1 Match Winning Over. Gets overs in the middle",8
Stoinis is the evolved version of Dube,8
We need a Shaw or Pant miracle to win today,3
Omg this fucker Iyer is the dumbest shit ever!!,3
That was a freebie,3
Can we get 180 pls.35 in 18.,6
Axar still had another one?,2
Stoinis going for 5 in a death over. This is some serious captaincy by Iyer even if it was a fluke.,2
Minimum 20,2
"Best thing for Australia from this IPL is bowling of Stoinis and Maxwell. Along with Marsh, these three can be trusted to play the role of 5th bowler in white-ball cricket.",1
Ok stoinis pies are not good enough but sams pies are just mmmmmh,1
Should’ve bowled Nortje or Rabada,4
Sams is Ricky Ponting quota,7
BigPP onslaught begins!!!,6
Bc why are you bowling Sams,5
Why does Iyer always do this? Bowl Rabada and Nortje first then bowl Sams.,4
Straight up chutiya delivery lmao,5
Is he really worth sitting Hetmyer out for?,5
Cmon Sams!!,0
Sam's lodhu 😭😭😭,3
Why the fuck is sams bowling,4
Big over this,1
"behenchod, 60 nahi chaiye firse

Edit : inb4 100",4
Sams has enrolled for the no chin gang,6
Bro atleast try to bounce the ball,5
Stop this bull shit Delhi..around the wicket into the batsman short of length,5
Pound-ya,4
Full toss to Hardik. C'mon.,3
"Some of these deliveries tho man, woeful",4
"Iyer and his stupid captaincy, why will you bowl Sam's and not rabada and Nokia against Hardik.. dumb",2
What the fuck are you giving that to Pandya for,4
Again Sams? I don't get this captaincy!,4
I can't watch this over,6
"No not Daniel Sams, wtf Shreyas",2
They average 2 RPO more than all 7 other teams in the last 5 overs 😂😂😂,9
Sams will get the Unadkat-Rajpoot treatment now,9
Gayle is more energetic in the field than Ashwin. And he's 41!,13
Nice Yorker,2
Who was that fatty that just jogged after the ball,6
I am betting on Hardik being in his fuccboi zone today and going the fastest half century this season,9
[deleted],7
LESS GO SAMS,5
"Nobody:

Rohit: 4-5 vada paav kha leta hu. Phir fielding karne jana hai :p",6
full toss to pandya all the time,8
"Retarded captaincy from Iyer.
Why Sams now?",10
Sams has been DC's worst bowler and that's saying something given how horrific the Saffer duo have been,12
Pandya gets suspiciously high number of full-tosses in death overs. What's the deal?,9
Who the fuck is Sams and why is he in the team? Looks like Sunday league bowler,17
Should have played Keemo Paul instead of Daniel Sams,18
Iyer doesn't know how to use his bowlers.,11
Deshpande was enough for this shit but we have to get variety and took Sams.,7
Iyer you better score these free runs you give the other teams!,9
I dont have much confidence in DC's batting,2
Sexy bowling,0
"Ishan Kishan was really nowhere in the conversation about the Indian team spot 
 
He has really boosted his chance of a spot in t20 squad",2
Have a feeling its a very decent score,2
"hardik go soft now, only one cock per game is allowed to score",9
Lmfao what kinda face is sams making??,7
why does Kishan go aerial every call,3
"Interesting a lot of guys with RCB flair has problem with sky getting attention on this sub , wants to point out at other guys. I wonder why!",1
That was wide. Fuck,4
"Still a serious score, and with two explosive batsmen on the crease.",3
Sams kind of did a comeback,5
Kishan bats ugly,0
My gf says she likes Ishan’s face🥴,12
Wide ball,4
Wtf he jogged infront of the ball,1
Hope tomorrow's match is on a batting wicket,3
Pocket dynamo kishan,3
"Kishan Kishan should go ahead of Sanju in India's T20I WK sweepstakes, at this rate. How has he been in domestic/FC? Could he play ODIs and Tests in like a few years after Saha retires?",4
"Why Pandya has Audi on his neck?

Lmao",8
I thought Stoinis was covering Sams' quota but now I realise Axar got snubbed.,4
"Been a pretty good over from Sam's so far, only the one bad ball

Edit: My RCB reverse jinx powers are mighty",4
Shit bowler. Absolute nobody,1
Sams is painfully mediocre,13
Sams is bang average,10
The figures are gonna suggest otherwise but Sams didnt bowl that badly.,2
Bruh,3
2 overs left. 30 runs possible,2
I hope kishan gets more strike,1
Ok two overs from the best bowlers left 20 runs and I am fine,5
Sams is waste of an overseas player.,3
Ishaaaandar,4
two wickets next over,3
Game slipping from DC hands. Idiotic to bowl Sams now when Stoinis bowled well.,4
Did Sams suck Ponting’s dick or something? Why’s he playing? At least Harshal could bat a bit.,7
"I don't understand hindi commentators, batman will play the worst possible shot on a delivery and they'll say whatta shot.",5
This is on the captain!!,1
Has there been an instance where a 6 caused injury to someone in stands?,2
Kishan so good  this season!!,2
"5th bowler is such a massive problem for this team, should've used sams in the powerplay to take wickets. He's not a death bowler",2
190 on the cards,1
Why do Hardik and Pollard get much more full tosses to cash in on than other batsmen?,1
Sam's has been really a pie chucker.. next game get Hetmyer in and let Stoinis bowl his overs..,2
Why isn't the fielder near the boundary rope???????,2
Kishan looks so sad after scoring a six lmao,3
Under 180?,1
Daniel Sams = Australian Unadkat,4
"No matter how much you run from it, 190 arrives",5
I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to bowl against MI,2
Our 5th bowler problem biting our ass again,2
Ishan might not be that consistent yet but he should have been the one selected for the Australian Tour instead of Samson as the backup Keeper.,4
SKY and Kishan need to get into the Indian team immediately.,5
Sams ain't it,2
Kishans stance is made for sixes. Really strong core.,7
28 sixes in 12 innings!!!,3
Delhi could chase 180 if the top order fires but it's like a 50/50 shot,5
What a waste of a foreign slot. Keemo Paul wouldnt have been this bad.,6
How did it go to six kishan? He looked so out of posn for that shot.,3
Poor poor final delivery,2
"honestly ive never seen crowd sound so bad, everytime its a boundary theres nothing but when it goes straight to a fielder they go mental",2
"I was wrong. MI won't score 170 they gonna get 190, and DC won't score 90, they'll score 80.",3
"After wicket falls, bring Rabada back. Some sus captaincy here",2
So sams is an aussie unadkat after all,5
Can someone tell me why DC is playing Sams?,7
"They should have given another over to Stoinis, maybe 20th, after finishing with Rabada and Nokia.",2
Not much difference between Sams and Deshapande,2
all I ask for is ~40 of last two. is it a big ask? XD,1
Stuck with a stupid dilemma. I don't want either of these teams to win.,6
Daniel 'Khaleel Ahmed' Sams.,8
"Sams 40(4) last match and 44(4) in this match.



Surely Keamo Paul can do that for you plus he can cunt some balls",9
Just play my boy sandeep instead of this guy before it's too late,11
Fuckboiiiiiiiii,8
Excellent shot!,4
"Man even Harshal patel/Deshpandey would've gone for 40, but taken a wicket. Don't like this sam's guy at all.",6
Mumbai always gets a good score despite a couple of ducks,7
What a waste of legendary tunuk tunuk,6
Poor Lynn,7
Lmao Hardik you slut!,7
Daniel Sams is like discount Harshal Patel lmao,12
Good timing.,4
That was some shot! Helicopter lite,8
What a shot fuccboi,6
mamma mia,5
"Lol. People were praising Iyer just 30 mins back when Ashwin was getting lucky wickets because batsmen wanted to hit out. Now, they're saying he's shit.",6
"They already have 160 which we can’t chase with overs left from Rabada Nortje left.

There lies the moronic Iyer captaincy!",3
Man MI’s Batting is tooo OP,3
Lynn looking like a make-a-wish kid,5
"Best bowler in the world being spanked all over, only in IPL",3
Lmao vada pav had a golden duck today ? Damn,2
Who is Daniel Sams?,1
Hardik is OP but his tattoos are absolute trash.,3
May as well have played an Indian seamer and kept Hetmyer lol,3
Chris 'Jonny Sins' Lynn,5
Need 4-5 sixes more :P,2
A large part of MI’s success has been Krunal quietly slipping in an economical over here and there. DC absolutely has to maul him if they need to win. Can’t let him get away then succumb to Bumrah.,9
Fuccboi fuccs,4
Rabada wtf,3
Poor poor bowling..,3
What a shot,2
Delhi Daredevils making a comeback!,3
Fucking Hardik man,2
Pounding by Pound-ya,7
Man MI is so hard to bowl to - they got 5 wickets and are still up against 3 more players who can take the game away.,5
Hardik smashing Rabada woah,11
Yeahhhhhhhh HARDIKKKK,3
Fuckboi mode on 😎😎😎,10
Show more of Lynn camera man,6
This is why Rabada Nortje should’ve came after the good Stoinis over,1
Rabada getting taken to the laundromat,6
People downvoted me last time when i wrote rabada and nortje have been meh bowlers,5
"Le Rabada bhi pit gaya, ab?",2
Panduuuuu take my energy!!,2
Pandu bro killin' it,3
Ok rabada has channeled deshpandes spirit and I ain't complaining,2
That's ruthless,2
"Purple Cap Holder?

Hardik doesn't care",4
"Imagine player like Chris Lynn has to sit out an entire season.

That shows the strength of current MI squad.",6
Knock knock: fuckboi is here,1
"lmao, start doom posting bois",2
Hardik is def not surviving this over,1
Please stop God help,7
HARD DICK,3
"Hardik's hitting Rabada with ease

This is incredible hitting",3
Praying to god for an RCB win. We can’t beat SRH at all.,2
Lol Rabada thrashed,5
"Why is MI sooo strong? This is illegal.
Team like this shudnt exist.",12
Lord Sams,5
ok Delhi is done,8
No Ishan Kishan and Surya for Indian team. Time for Mota Ambani to launch Jio Mumbai Indians as registered ICC team?,7
400 strike rate incoming,3
"Dan Sams 3 matches 114 runs in 12 overs no wicket

Why dont they play Keemo paul or even a Sandeep Lamichhane instead",3
Hardik is a killer man,3
Hardik is clearly a bellend but boy he hits the ball so cleanly. Serious player,4
Bowl a fast bouncer not this crap!,2
FUCCBOI in IPL>>>>>>>>in International,8
Bru Rabada wtf? Giving him length???,2
"Fuck, that is some power hitting",5
haha hardik doesn't care about rabada,3
Banging a specialist bowler,3
DC Is BaCK In ThE GamE,3
'Pan' in Pandya means 'Lau',5
[removed],17
Don't ever bowl slow to fucc boi..,6
lmao and this is rabada bowling to you,3
Hardik is absolutely laying into Rabada. MI looking well on course to win this game.,6
"Damn Hardik! 
 
Didn't know you could hit express bowlers too",4
"Hardik be like ""Rabada who, all I can see is Unadkat""",9
Ashwin and Axar bowled their heart out to save Rabada and Nortje overs. But these fuckers are ruining it.,6
Wow! Dude Hardik maintain this form in Australia as well!,11
Pandya!!!,5
THAT SOUND off the bat..makes me cum..,9
"Should've dropped Krunal's catch, but Ethical Mind wouldn't allow it",7
"This score is already so high, damn.",4
"Jesus christ, Hardik is abusing Rabada.",8
Daamn Hardik smashing Rabada. Good news for India too.,13
Does Krunal whoops his ass in dressing room. Why is Hardik always angry lmao,16
Meanwhile rcb players celebrating party in a yatch knowing tomorrow's result,25
"Rabada has been bowling tripe.

But Pandya is making him look like Dominic Cork",3
Remember the name.,12
Pitch is definitely flat!,3
"Yeah Rabada can do THAT and shut players down, but nooo gotta try that sweet slower one ffs",11
We're screwed,7
~~boost~~ monster energy is secret of my energy : HP,3
Surprised that Pant didn't appeal for that,5
What a player hardik is,6
All hope is lost let me go and cry in a corner and wait for Q2,5
"RCB top 4 gone, its game over. MI top 4 gone comes Pollard and Hardik",12
Well next match it is then,5
Keemo Paul should've been tried on these slow pitches instead of Sams. Proven performer.,7
he's getting ruined,3
"People always think mumbai gets hunted 

*but at the ned of the day mumbai is always the hunter*",5
Rabada appealing. Lol,7
Gaffany doesn't give a shit about bullshit calls.,9
This target is beyond DC's reach.....,6
We ain't chasing this,9
This is what confuses me. Bowlers like Rabada and Bumrah have the yorker but always go for length in the death.,8
Only Pant storm can help chase this total but that is very unlikely.,10
Hardik just proves you don’t need a big beefy body to cunt the ball all around the park.,11
Hardik helping his bro Bumrah by smashing the fuck outta Rabada,10
"As I said, no matter what happens before, MI always find a way to get to 180+ (exc last match which was a dead rubber for them)",19
Kagiso rajpoot,7
[removed],2
"Pandya hitting Rabada?

As a RCB fan- confused noises 

As a India fan- happy noises",10
Rabada going for a run is  bad very bad omen that too wicketless. Very bad,4
What is it with so many players having shit neck tattoos lmao,5
Idc if this over gets no more runs we got 13 from rabada,2
"Bc bowl 6 yorkers, why the fuck do you want to experiment.",8
rabada appealing for one hand one bounce,6
Lmao did rabada even take a single wicket since that srh game where his record broke,11
190 looking not so far now,3
"What's a good target on this pitch? MI can easily get to 190+ now, which is quite competitive in a qualifier game.",4
"Team plays well for a moment: Great captaincy!


Team concedes 2 sixes: Shit captaincy!",8
"wtf thiccboi gave away 5 rpo with a wicket, get him back",5
Delhi choked pretty hard after a good comeback in middle overs courtesy Ashwin,14
Score already out of our reach :(,11
Inb4: Panty 100,7
Clown fans: Hardick isn't bowling so he shouldn't be in the national team 🤡🤡,29
"In some matches, when I see Hardik Pandya going nuts with all those boundaries, I feel that he is a real life version of the players from those cricket games I used the play in the childhood. No singles or doubles. Just boundaries. Every single over.",14
Hardik is the one bright spot in our T20I squad middle order,12
Bye Bye DC,3
Iyer: Rabada let me down,14
Pandya clears this long boundaries so easily. Respect,14
Obligatory 190+,7
"Nice cock kishan

I mean shot",15
Lol tharki cameraman😈😂,5
Wow. Cannot believe Nokia and Rabada getting cunted around like nothing.,23
Scenes if MI somehow gets to 200 lol,13
WTF Rabada. Club level bowling this.,7
Rabada having a bad back end of the tournament,10
Who's this club bowler? - MI probably,8
Kissan Jam ahhhhh,2
Iyer literally gifting runs with his shitty field placement,2
Rabada been trash the last 4-5 matches,3
LETSSS FUCKING GOO MI!!,3
Absolutely amazing that he got that in the gap even tho the bat turned in his hands,7
Chutiya field placement again by DC,6
Brohit finally looks relaxed,6
Delhi is out of this game now.,5
Pls get 200 pls get to 200,6
200 seems possible now,3

Ok now 190 is on the menu boys,13
Ishan Kishan plays offside shots?! Surprised pikachu face,2
Rabada has lost some confidence after being destroyed by Warner in that over.,36
Is the outfield slow or I am just hallucinating?,3
"Can bring in Keemo Paul instead of sams, use axar, stoinis, paul for the 8 overs.",3
"ya no, it's done for DC",2
What's that field,1
W I C K E T L E S S,5
40 off 17... madlads,3
Bowl stoinis cowards,6
Good thing about Rohits innings was he did not kill momentum like Virat. He killed the momentum killer instead.,9
"Fuck me , mi should be illegal just too fucking op",11
Wow pandya,4
"Rabada:42-0, I guess that tells you a story",16
Rabada wicketless again 😳,10
hot take : bowl stoinis,3
The match seems done. With Bumrah-Boult chasing 180+ is a hard ask.,5
Whew Bumrah's got a chance to catch up,3
"Nah we can't make this much.
Will lose 5 wickets before even reaching 70-80",11
Every Commentators seam to have idea on how to bowl to Pandya Alas Bowlers are stupid as shit 😂😭😂😭,1
Hardik to play in Australia only for his batting or no?,9
Helicopter from Ranchi !,7
Man what happened to rabada,5
"So, Rabada conceded more runs than Sams (:",8
How India aren’t winning T20 WC with these insane players is just crazy to me,12
Rohit 0 Polly 0 still 180 wtf is this team?,61
Thala Kishan,7
Rabada has had terrible matches recently. His economy compared to Bumrah and Jofra is not good.,7
Rabada not having a good day makes it so much worse for DC. All upto Nortje here...,1
"Two successive low full tosses.

Rabada lucky Kishan didn't connect well on either",5
How's dew atm?,1
"As said earlier ""Dread it, Run from it, but MI's batting comes alive in the death overs""

190 is a very good score here especially against this DC side",17
was that a helicopter shot?,7
Rabada going wicketless...,6
I love that two captains car ad👌🏾,2
Delhi would try to play for NRR,2
We played like rcb we lost wickets but we somehow still reached over 180,2
Doesn’t deserve the purple cap.,1
No homo but Vikrant Massey is very handsome,2
I think that first game against MI broke Rabada. He was taking wickets like a boss up until then,1
How many of ishan's mishits have gone to the boundary?,3
No chance DC chase this unless Pant steps up.,3
"200 is on the card boys, believe in pandya",2
Sams to rabada:- You and i are not so different,3
You can literally take Axar out of the game by sending in two left handers. That is so hilariously sad.,4

Typical MI finish,1
this MI team are just fucking bullies man. You get rohit and pollard both out on 0 and still they will score a shit ton,9
Do orange and purple caps thing continue into the playoffs?,2
Ishan kishan seems to be more consistent than Pant and Samson this season. Hopefully he will get a chance to plan for India.,4
please stop Mumbai from reaching final,5
Man its so unfair MI has 2 of the best fast bowlers and 2 of the best finishers.,5
200 plssss,3
I mean sure Mumbai are an inherently dislikeable team but at least they didn’t change their name from being pretty cool to something that sucks so bad it doesn’t even really make sense,7
"Hyderabad, specifically Warner broke Rabada 🥺",8
Rabada getting bullied like he's Avesh Khan. You'd hate to see it.,7
Rabada losing his magic at the most important part of tournament.. :(,4
Rabada going wicket less hopefully Bumrah gets Purple cap this time,7

To be honest that was shit bowling after over 15,2
Nobody is saying how consistently ishaan is playing,3
"Why is little ambani at the ground, is he the one who enters the password for the caymans account?",4
Kohli made 302 out of 460 runs by running between the wickets.,4
I only see Deli chasing this down if two people can strike over 200 for 40 runs or if one person score 80 plus.,3
Finally Nortje with some variations,1
Shaw and Pant need to get off their fat asses tonight or we're done. Don't see us winning against SRH either (sorry RCB),2
It seems like what ever kind of start MI has- they always manage to get to 180-200,2
"Rabada getting cunted and wicketless:


DC fans: *Dorime* 🙏",1

Bowl to the leg stump and not the offside where he can free his arms.,1
Yes Pant you have to finally wake up from your slumber and do some shit today,7
Kung Fu Pandya,5
Having rahane today chasing 190 is just gonna be a liability,4
Pandya can't fuck girls now because he's married so he's fucking boys now.,17
Right MI has once again rampaged at the death and pretty much won it. This is not gonna be chased with Rahane and Iyer at 3 and 4.,2

Hardik is back,3
This one even better****,7
Holy shit. Pandya - the six dealer is back.,5
Snacking Rabada Nortje with ease this is Hardik 2.0,5
This is 3rd or 4th time this season MI has reached 190 when it never looked like it,5
Where did MI find Hardick tho?,6
What was that six!!!,3
Ok DC you're not chasing that. You're not winning against SRH either.. can kiss that fatass trophy goodbye now.,4

wtf even is the point of getting wickets against MI,2
Woah Pandya!!!,1
WTF Hardik is unbelievable,3
Why would you even bat Krunal before this guy who is hitting sixes for fun?,3
I'd let Hardik fuck me,3
Can't believe I thought Delhi might restrict them to 180 🤡,3
The plan was all along to hit the Best death bowlers,3
1more 6 pls,2
"Get Dhawan out and the match is over, right?",6
Man! Hardik just makes me orgasm with his hitting.,2
Yeah I dont see Delhi chasing this,1

Harddick Porndiya,7
Bhenchod,1
Hardixk has hit 0 fours. Dealing with only 6s,19
Springs in Hardik's bat confirmed!,2

Let’s hit a 6 and get to 200 please,6

Now if only DC had a Ben Stokes who’d make everyone forget Hardik’s name tonight,3
"Finally a short ball! 

How dumb is this team!!",3
Good thing Pant has added all that natural protection.,1
Should have dropped Krunal's catch 😂😂😂,12
Pant injured again,2
they dont seem to have a plan for hardik. England vs india in cwc 2019 was painful to see because they were prepared for him. they bowled that offside line close to the body choking his main hitting strokes,8
What a mess by DC!,3
Hardik good enough to play at 5 for India without bowling,10
"Had [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/johrcr/-/gb8fldu) this when Mumbai were looking at 160 maybe, lmao

Where was that rcb guy who said we won’t get to 150?,7
Yes yes yes yes,3
Pandya's sixes are gonna give me wet dreams tonight.,7
MI somehow find a way to keep getting to 200 somehow. Favorites to win the IPL hands down.,11
Called it - 200,7
"Good guy Pandya giving the final ball to IK. 

This team needs auditing. Too OP. Not joking.",10
"Rohit and Pollard out for 0

MI still proceed to hit 200",10

If DC chase this down, they'll fully deserve it.",14
"Lost 4 wickets under 20 runs, still got that 200!

Why is he still disappointed lol,6

Hardik will be dropped from Indian team because hE dOeS nOt bOwL,8
DC gonna lose bigly here,4
Kishan and pandya fucked dc without lube.,9
MI should be illegal. Both senior players scored duck and they still got 200,13
Ya the only hope we have in the T20 WC is Hardik catching fire.,8
CHUTIYA JAISA BOWLING KAROGE TO PILOGE HI NAA,6
hardik made nokia look like unadkat,4
Has a team scored 200 with 2 players going for a duck,6
"They have Ishan, we have Shaw.",2
I just love this team!,3
Ayy Anant Ambani looks like an inflated Ishan Kishan,2
Rohit and Pollard ducks and still end up with 200,26
Very difficult for DC to chase thus,4
Someone upload this match to PornHub,5
Looks a batting pitch advantage delhi,2
FUCK THIS TEAM,4
"So, turns out Sams is DC's best death bowler.",5
See MI pulled a sneaky on ya,5
nobody chasing 200 here,2
Fking eh Mumbai. That's one way to grab the match by the balls and take control,2
Can we see a 100 from Dhawan?,3
Delhi ain't chasing this.,4
"I'm so happy! Psychological advantage for us. Also, who would imagine getting to 200 when 2 of your main batsmen get out on duck?",7
*Two people reach 50 with just one six*,4
Yessssss fuckkk yeah,3
Hardik has gone for the Sardar Khan look,5
Hardik: Fours? What are those???,5
MI laughs at the concept of accumulator-hitter.,10
I will be very surprised if any other team wins the IPL,10
Which International team can defeat this team? If MI players plays for MI not their national teams.,8

"Rohit and Pollard get ducks and they still score 200? 
Ban this team ffs",7
"Dread it, run from it, Mumbai's death overs onslaught still arrives.",9
The fact that we were able to get a 200 score despite 2 ducks from 2 of our best batsmen is insane!!!! Fuck yes MI!!!,5
This MI team is invincible.,6
How can Mumbai afford so many match-winners? Do they pay behind the scenes?,4
Always nice seeing VadaPav happy,2
"I went off reddit, because superstitions. 

WOW. Only took ducks off Rohit and Pollard to stop us at 200",5
Sams: *mai karu toh sala character dheela hai*,4
Uncapped Kishan made mockery of Rabada-Nortje bowling (won’t mention Pandya because he’s obviously so OP),13
"Fuck Sanju, all my homies now want Ishan in the team.",7
"29 fucking sixes in 12 innings !!! 

What a baby face assassin we have found in him!!",9
See you in the finals on Sunday,1
"Well delhi are fucked like always, no hope now",5
The strongest team of IPL,5
"Nokia should now say, “I am here” to MI dugout",2
WTF Nortje Sledging SKY and both scores half century,5
"LOL. Even with the captain and vice captain going for zero, MI still goes for 200. Fuck y'all",11
Nortje got a half century too oof,8
Saffers and choking in big games. Feelsbadman,2
Gg bois. Let's just hope RCB wins or we're not even entering the fucking final.,1
MAN I LOVE MI MI IS LOVE MI IS LIFE,6
MI finishing better than Johnny Sins.,2
kUUUUTT DIYE!!,2
Enjoyed the innings dang,1
"Iyer should never be Indian captain.. such dumb captaincy with his bowling changes.. Stoinis gives 5 runs and doesn't bowls again.. wow.

200 to win.. against bumrah and Boult.. Nah, not gonna happen.",3
Skinhead Pandya > fucboi Pandya?? 😳😳,9
Man this MI team reminds me of 2000s Australia,6
"Ok indian selection need to include young stars (ishan kishan, suryaKumar )",3
We have one of the best T20 sides ever rn,6
"MI : 101/4 in 12.2

Also MI : Anyway.",10
"I am sorry, but the way Delhi has been batting this game is well beyond lost.

Especially considering Mumbai aren't going to gift them as many as Delhi dished out.",5
And this is what a good middle order does.....where can RCB get one of that?,7
DC done. Hop on to Q2 now,5
How in the flying fuck do you score 200 after losing Rohit and Pollard for ducks?,15
92 runs off the last 6 overs,6
I bet that prayer reading grandma of MI will go for record amount if she ever enters IPL auciton,10
Can’t wait for 70-5 after 13 overs now ',8
my body is ready for a gabbar/pant 100,7
"God damn MI, how do you manage to get 200 so effortlessly?",7
It’s alright! We did what we could:) no regrets,3
The belief of this Mumbai Indians side is amazing - full of intent and backing their game. They would be able to beat a lot of international sides.,8
Pandya wants to send Rabada and Nortje to Dinda Academy,5
is hardik the most consistent closer? astounding,9
Arey chotte -- Rohit sharma,10
Going back to cave,3
Obligatory MI OP comment,8
I said we are gonna show our 12.2 death run rate and we showed them,4
Half century for nortje 🤩🤩🤩,8
"Man shit bowling and all I know, but MI just plays on cheat codes, it's super unfair.",8
Rohit sitting at a table and clapping like the Chief  Guest at my sports day,11
Give walkover. Enough embarrassment,8
"Thank god for Kishan and Pandya, they brought MI right back on track on 10 RR after that middle collapse.",5
Hardik is the answer to the view that you need to be thicc to hit sixes.,7
"Mumbai op guys, need a nerf in the next update.",5
Mind you this Kid Ishan Kishan is not on flight to Australia. shame on BCCI THE SELECTORS VIRAT KOHLI SHASTRI YOU ME EVERYONE WE HAVE FAILED 😭😭😭,11
Delhi best bowling team lol,4
Game over,3
Almost 100 runs in the last 8 overs.,4
MI reached 200 where Nokia and Rabada bowled 4 overs at the death.,9
Mi I love you so much what a team. OP,4
"Awful deliveries from Delhi in last 3 overs.

is this a comfortable score on this ground ?",3
Rabada and Nortje  - 92 runs in 8 overs.,5
"Massively let down by our three premium overseas pacers. Might as well drop all of them and play Avesh Khan, Mohit Sharma and Tushar. Surely they'll do better lol.",3
Mumbai Indians is such a titan,2
"Last 5 overs:

2 4 1 6 1 4 W 1 1 1 2 0 6 2 1 1 1 6 6 6 0 1 4 1 1 0 6 6 1 6

78 runs

RR 15.6",9
Mumbai Indians definitely like the figure 200 😂😂,4
"Nokia-Rabada-Sams gave 136 in 12  Overs

Wah Bhenco Wah",10
"MI and proving they're better in death overs, both in bowling as well as batting",5
92 off the last 6 overs fuck me,6
"I really don’t understand how Pant doesn’t get fired up seeing such knocks from Kishan,Samson and saha",4
Mumbai are the Golden State Warriors of Ipl.,3
Rahane tuk tuk today?,1
This will be a cringe interview,2
MI be like MC BC DC,5
Mumbai reaching 200 despite Rohit and Pollard scoring a duck. We need a mega auction soon!!!,5
Stage is set for chonky bois,3
"The lower middle order of Pollard and the Pandya bros is a cheat code in T20 cricket.

Add QDK and Suryakumar in his current form and it's going to take a miracle to beat MI in the final.",10
120 all out incoming.,1
Jokes on my friend who bet MI wud never reach 200 today.. Neways I won the beer,8
"This is why MI is the best team there is.

We don't depend on one or two people.

Everyone contributes and gets the job done.👊💪",34
Turning a 160 innings to a 200 one. Just the usual innings for MI.,9
Rahane 29(34),10
Why are the players wearing black bands?,3
"Didn't give stoinis another over, straight up shit captaincy lmao",2
Mumbai is on whole different level. No one comes even close to them.,6
Mumbai has so many douchebags in their team (pandyas amount to 5 douchebags) and so many fat doughy rich motabhais sitting on the sidelines.,3
Quite a few of Delhi’s players have choked today. Just hope Dhawan doesn’t play a silly shot to get out now.,3
"Rabada ko kya hogya,  pichli 4-5 games se",3
Imagine a batting lineup where Rohit is the weakest link,9
While kohli and Rahul prefer 120sr,3
Congratulations to Nokia for scoring half century,5
Gg delhi,4
I don't think I will support DC in the future.,5
wE wiLL bOwL tHaNks,7
"Surely Kishan is better than Samson Lmao

Pant>> Kishan> Samson",14
"Har gaye pakka. 130 bhi nahi reach karegi delhi.
Mein ab nabi dekh raha direct ending mein check karunga",1
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",13
Sams has no skills with the ball. HE DOESN'T BELONG HERE.,1
"Rohit and Pollard going out for duck and MI still reaching 200.....

I mean how many players do you need to get wickets of to restrict MI...

Truly an OP team....",16
Mumbai this season : first 10 overs look like they'll reach 200. Next 5 : would be happy if they cross 160. By the end of the innings score : 200,47
[deleted],37
Tbh aren’t mumbai fans bored by now ? Fuckin hell,5
"Lol chasing with 1 batsman down, 4 accumulators and 2 out of form hitters. Yeah Delhi gonna be dead today",11
"Same shit different toilet. Worst part is We bet all our chips on the bowling, we do not have the batting capable of chasing anything close to 200.",15
"Sams: You!!!

Rabada: No you!!!!

Nortje: NO ME!!!!!!",15
Just get Shikhar out first,4
"Two players who are considered as power hitters, go for a duck. Still reaches 200. That's not just a good innings, that's domination",11
Mi could play the WT20 and be favourites there,15
I would rather face DC than MI in qualifier 2 if we beat SRH in the eliminator,4
Is this the highest number of runs scored in last 6 overs?,3
"Rabada and nortje both expensive that in a crunch game.
Now this now boult and bumrah bowl",5
Kohli : Hardik is dropped from Indian team because hE dOeS nOt bOwL,24
That’s one hell of a finish after their mid innings collapse,5
"18 , 5, 17, 18, 20 in last 5 overs.",13
Honestly MI vs SRH is going to be a good competitive one.,8
"Rabada and Nortje were bowling well before the 2nd time-out.

Both of them received the payment from Mota Bhai after that. Imagine if Mota Bhai paid them on time? 250 runs was a possibility.",15
"The only way I see RCB winning a final against MI (if that happens, that is) is if they chase and both of their 2 top players fire",9
Inb4 obligatory duck from one of the openers and iyer scoring 27(22) masterclass,28
Rohit Sharma is me in College projects where I contributed least but was hoping to get 80/100 everytime ☺️,15
Mi op,2
Someone remind Mumbai that this is an even year.,9
Poor bowling. Full toss and in slots. No preparation from DC bowlers. Ashwin saved their ass or it could have been worse.,8
So Pollard and Rohit go for duck and MI scores 200! What a batting lineup!,7
Well that was impressive.,5
Lord Rahane gonna win this 119SR,14
only RR can chase this,9
"*Rohit and Polly out for duck*

MI: Oh no!
       Anyway",44
"U drop hetmyer for an overseas pacer

But 3 overseas pacers bleed runs at >11 rpo",15
That was an ABD shot,6
78 in last 5 (73 from 4 excluding thiccboi's over). This is just fucking bullying. MI death batting is class apart,12
Ah you know your team bowled trash when stoinis was the nest bowler,3
"Forcefield conspiracy theory confirmed for the safest hatchback, not even MI's OP batting line-up can hit it in this masterclass of an innings. 

Definitely buying an Altroz now",5
Wtf 92 runs in last 5,5
200 enough? YEAH I THINK SO!!!!,6
I had to go away for 2 overs and damn,2
"Why didn't Stonis get another over? He should've bowled the 20th, Rabada and Nortje should've got the 18th and 19th.",3
Pandya’S head is very shapely👍🏽,5
Pandya and Kishan starring in a porn clip,7
I'm pretty sure they Braindead Management Shastri and Kohli will play Sundar over Hardik,1
"MI OP in the chat, boys!",6
"I mean I'd say that maybe if they don't panic while batting they might actually stand a chance to chase this down... But I don't truly believe that. 

I fucking hate MI. 

Well not really hate them, I just hate how good they are.

At least NRR isn't a factor tonight?",15
55 off the last 3. Mumbai is fucking scary this year.,24
Man Kohli and Iyer are almost on the same level of captaincy there. The inability to use their resources the best cunts them everytime,2
Do you think they would have done better if they bowled stoinis more?,4
Wtf is this tactic to bowl full tosses Bc,11
"hamko lavada farak nahi padta toss se..

toss: we dont give a rats ass about the toss",9
"To the people who said Hardik can't hit against the best bowlers, there you go.",14
"MI winning easily, expecting another 129-7 type inning from DC",5
let pandya breathe ffs,4
MI : I am inevitable,5
In before Rahane 20(23),12
"If Rabada and Nokia are getting smacked like this, what chance do others have?",11
Hardik should be dropped . He hit no 4s in 15 balls at the death . What a waste .,75
Insane hitting by paltans,5
"Can't match rn

Tf, last i saw  MI was like 120/4, how did they climb to 2 frickin hundred?",12
Only Gabbar's 100 can save DC,11
Inb4 Shaw 0(2),16
Delhi 100-10 (19.2) overs,6
Sunny definitely supports MI lol,6
"DC 201/3 (18.1 overs)

Rahane 105 (40)",15
[deleted],2
"Who's more important to any team, Bumrah or Pandya? Unfair comparison maybe but it's very close.",3
Why doesn't Hardik bowl anymore?,1
"Kaun Jitega? 
⭕️RCB - like🔥🔥
⭕️SRH - comment",-13
"Ishan Kishan is the real deal. Wicketkeeper too. Seems to have overcome some attitude issues. If the other young Indian prospects (Pant / Samson) don't sort themselves out quick, he deserves a shot at the big time.",6

"I am gonna upload this to Hub:-

Fucksters Youngsters in blue clothing fuck South African players for fun and make fun of the old while teaming up with their homie from Australia with sexy commentary with an angry coach giving them the **** position in the depth field of 30 yards giving the viewers orgasm.",7
Ashwin must be getting KXIP flashbacks with this kind of death bowling.,6
hardik starting to look more like krunal than krunal himself,3
You can rely on South Africans to fail you in crunch situations.,16
delhi batsmen horribly out of form to chase 200,7
[deleted],11
"Take a punt, and send Pant to open.",5
"Small skinny guys consistently hitting sixes for Mumbai, Ambani steroids must be working well",5
200 runs in last 5 overs!,2
Braindead to play rahane+sams over hetty+harshal Ik rahane gave you a good innings but that's his peak lol he's useless in 180+ chases and veryyyyyy selfish.,2
"MI after 100 for 4 - no worries we will get to 200.

RCB after 2 wickets - ABD has to play cautiously as there is not much batting to come.",9
"Random thought  - Rohit is not at his best physically, but it’s not okay to make fun of his weight, calling him vada pav and shit, I get doing it as a joke, but people like Sehwag calling him like that in public is just inexcusable. Why is it not frowned upon to body-shame men?",6
"Just want a MI RCB final , then I don’t care who wins",8
Have a hunch that Rahane gonna give us something special against his home town based team,4
"MI is such a balanced team.

They have scored 200 and yet there were 2 batsmen who scored 0.

Pandya with SR of almost 300 !?",7
"MI’s uncapped Indian players are the strength of the side, for other teams they often turn out to be the weak links to be targeted, changes everything",5
"I really love this kind of batting man. Very few teams have the confidence to go. When they were 4 wickets down, any team would have played low because if 1 wicket goes, score is done. It's just so much fun to watch. 


MI are truly a complete team. From openers to middle order to finishers.",7
DC's best pacers were destroyed today. I am expecting a similar result for mumbai Pacers.,8
"DC can still steal this. Our win depends on how well Rahul and Krunal would bowl, DC's batters will definitely target them.",3
"The fuck Mumbai??

Its an even year!!",24
Why the fuck you don't bowl stoinis more!!!,5
"It's on Shaw, Iyer, and Pant today. Either show up or fuck off.",4
The only way DC can win this is to keep up with the asking rate of 10 and not take the game to a stage where you need 70 off 20.,5
"200 against DC in a pressure game, should not be hard to defend",3
"Rabada and Nortje are fucking overrated this season

Downvote me as much as you like idgaf

Archer, Bumrah GIVE their team a wicket whenever they need it

These two on the other hand barely deliver it when it matters the most

Not to forget rabada's wickets majorly came in the death overs when batsmen are constantly slogging the ball

This match is lost, wouldn't be surprised if this bowling lineup gets wrecked by SRH/RCB",12
"Rohit and Pollard gone for duck, and STILL they managed 200...

I don't think there's any other team capable of this right now.",8
Should Shaw open or rahane?,3
In before DC 112 all out,5
"If MI vs Rest of IPL team happens, I bet MI still has a probability of winning the match.",9
I am not even a MI supporter but I absolutely loved the way Pandya and Kishan batted. This is the kind of finish I've missed watching when India plays. Wish Pandya bats the same way in T20 WC.,12
"even if Dhawan scores a 100(50) here, the rest of the team will still be only be able to score 70(70)",12
Aye cheating cheating karta hai mumbai,5
"Dhawan 100

Shaw 101

Match over.",16
"Against trundlers like Boult and Pattinson, I'd be surprised if DC don't chase this in 15 overs.",6
Sams gave you an 11 economy. Probably would've been better off with Hetmeyer,6
"Hindi Commentators : *Hardik only hits against uncapped bowlers.*

Hardik Pandya : And I took that personally.",24
"At the moment. 

Mumbai Indians = FC Bayern Munich",15
So the 190/200 pattern stays alive.,7
DC be looking for How to kill T-1000 for dummies.,6
More props to Kishan as he played through the collapse to get MI to 200. If he keeps performing like this later and Samson fails to perform in Australia then Kishan should be the choice for T20's.,8
This MI team can beat any international team too I feel.,7
Mi were on 106 at 14 overs.,14
"love him or hate him, he is gonna fuck you up",8
"Most fours in tournament: sky (60)

Most sixes in tournament: kishan  (29)

Mi is too op mostly cuz of these beast uncapped players",38
Boult will get Junior Ravi Shastri in the first over,4
"On a serious note, I hope Rohit Sharma comes back in form. Some rough patches can last reallyyyy long and I hope it isn't the case with him.",9
Don't give them any pace on the ball and we should be okay.,6
Lol no way DC’s chasing this against the MI bowling line up,4
"Waiting for r/deathrattleporn from Boult to ""you know who""",9
This is what mercedes f1 fans must feel like.,8
How the hell did SRH control this batting lineup to < 150?,15

Delhi know they have to go from the first ball. Still far from over if they don't lose early wickets,4

What a fucking god tier batting performance,6
Last 6 overs 92 runs,6
Back to back playoffs without depending on other results. Something did go well for us in last 2 years. Just need to develop the knockout punch.,3
"Shaw and Iyer have played atleast 1 good innings. Pant has to show up now, not this devolved Pant but the Pant of past please for godsake",4
"Kishan's performances for India A have been getting better too. His last 5 innings for India A:


71* (84)

44(55)

40(41)

55(24)

What a score   fucking Ishan and pandya you beauties,3
"94 in last 5.

DC:Wait!!That's illegal.",14
Only Thigh Slapper with a 💯 and Panty boy could chase this.. sadly Pant is still wondering how to hit the ball this season..,8
MI’s indian players would alone carry the whole international team lol.,13
I want MI Vs RCB finals and whoever wins it is also the winner of the rift.,6
Wouldn't mind a dc win only if Pant finds form,3
Just realised that KL Rahul and Hardik are the only two proper T20 batsmen which current Indian team has.,13
Prithvi Shaw Redemption Arc?,3
I know we are all tired of Mumbai winning so many titles but they fucking deserve it.,10
Just a reminder that Delhi's bowling is much better than us,8
What's even more impressive is that these boundaries are huge,3
"DC boys: We gonna chase that. We can chase that!

Under their breath *BC MC Pandya janta nhi mera ba..*",12
"As a Rajasthan fan, Delhi fans should prepare for a vintage Rahane 60(45). He has screwed Rajasthan over several times in chases and I won't be surprised if he does it again today.",4
"Kishan most 6s in the tournament

QdK and SKY 483 and 451 runs at SR of 140 and 148

Pollard and Hardik with highest overall SR of any batsmen",12
3 overseas pacers were so bad. Even a batting slot gone now,3
200 with 2 ducks 😳,7
Atleast put up a fight. I'd rather we lose by 20 than by 90,3
"Pant sitting on his haunches when wicket keeping wondered:

WTF MUMBAI!!",19
"All my childhood I used to get bored of Australia winning the ODI world cups almost all the time. It almost always used to piss me off. I used to tell my friend that they should give a permanent trophy to Aussies and let all other teams compete for a second trophy. 

Let's do the same for MI. 

Edit: typo",14
"two kinds of predictions from ppl:

rahane 105 (40)

rahane 20 (23)",26
What was that rating thing,4
"I dont like Iyer the captain, or in this case Pontings tactics. When Krunal got out to stoinis and he finished with 5, why wouldn't you go for a rabada or nortje over then. You gave Pandya time to chip in and clearly he made the most of it

Now forget that, what kind of bowling was KG doing today. Missing his lengths completely and getting punished hard. After that Nortje getting spanked in the last over was the nail in the coffin",16
Why MI so op? Rohit pollard both go out for duck still they score 200!😩😖,12
Inb4 37(38) masterclass from Pant,13
MI just wanted to bully which ever team that’s gonna meet them in the final,9
4d move by Rohit Sharma getting a golden duck. More balls for Pandyas and Ishan Kishan,12
Time for Shaw to step up and get some big runs,7
Reality is that every team this IPL is scared of winning against MI because they are afraid if they do so Mumbai Police will arrest them all and put them in jail,4
What Delhi did wrong: got Rohit out for golden duck.,16
What if i told u this still isn't the best finish the've done all tournament,7
MI death over batting is basically stick cricket.,8
MI YOU BEASTS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
Illegal team dismantle this franchise,9
Bumrah and boult will show how to bowl on this wicket to rabada and norjte,6
saala rohit and Pollard duck gaye still 200 maardie... buri waali pitne waale hai.. (-ι_- ),9
What are the kkr fans feeling rn?,15
Should open with Pant and Dhawan,10
"Why are Biden-Trump stuck at 264-214 ?

When will the remaining counting be done?",18
"Archer

Bumrah

Rabada

Boult

Shami

Nortje

Fast bowlers ranking for me this ipl",8
Imagine playing rahane over hetty in a t20 game just to have useless sams in your side.,16
The only way Delhi is winning this is if Bumrah gets whacked.,8
Lol calling Ajit a fast bowler is a joke. Jadeja sometimes bowls faster than he did,8
Hehe.. that's what happens when u play saffers in knockouts. *hides*,12
Delhi have nothing to lose here. No worry about NRR. They have. Second chance as well. Just go from ball one.,12
"55 in last 3 overs

Nice.",5
"Pandya maybe a wanker, but he's our wanker.",33
Delhi Daredevils are back baby!!!,5
"This team proves me wrong again and again


I genuinely thought they will be restricted to something around 170 when Polly got dismissed and they scored 30 more than 170.",6
DC Neeeeed to bat the big Stoin ahead of Iyer and Pant to have any chance,4
"Bhogle: ""  Sorry, If Hardik doesn't bowl I don't think him playing as a batsman for India""




Hardik : "" Hold my 4 sixes against fiery Rabada & Nortje duo you nothing to add hack 😎""",39
I still stand by opening with Nortje so that we can get an actual partnership after the first wicket.,11
How are rcb fans doing,3
bc dhawan pls play the way you did against us,6
My bets on delhi. set the reminders.,10
"Who is the best player

Ishan Kishan - hit like 🔥🔥
Rishabh Pant - comment",-10
"So, technically, DC have to chase this 16overs. Bcos Bumrah. 

Unless somebody does a Nortje on Bumrah.",9
Someone who said that Delhi should've let Rohit play hasn't actually seen Rohit hitting after scoring 25,68
Can somebody PLEASE whisper ICC EVENT into Shikhar's ear. Grant me this wish.,47
abundant relieved joke wild rustic elastic recognise soft file hat ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `,11
That couldn't bat like this vs SRH -_-,5
inb4 Delhi loses 4 wickets in Powerplay and Iyer says “we lost the game in Powerplay itself”,8
Rahane at 3 and Iyer at 4 isn't really a great option for a 200 run chase.,9
I don't think MI will go easy on DC.,2
Scenes if Shaw and Pant redemption arc?,5
At least we'll have peak Pandya for India's tour of Australia.,5
Why is NCN playing over bogan boi,2
Stoinis the man only gave away 5 runs,5
Rahane fucks MI always. Guessing a 36 ball 50.,0
Are we gonna see Gabbar or Gobar today?,0
Someone needs to do a Stokes today,2
"MI are a dynasty and we all just gotta accept that. They're the Lakers, Mercedes, Patriots, Barcelona of the IPL",2
CSK fans sadder than DC fans,2
Friendly reminder that we had QdK and then we traded him to MI.......,6
[deleted],3
60/0 off the first 6 or the match is done,3
Rajasthan chased 190+ against MI a few matches ago pretty easily. Stokes played a blinder. DC need an innings like that today.,5
First wicket will be very crucial. Hopefully Shaw doesn't forget his roots,3
Rohit wants to bat again,2
"Elsewhere, great test match going on in US b/w Red Oldies and Blue Oldies",6
"Next time some American says- how can you follow a game that lasts 5 days?

Remind them the game finishes earlier than their election results :)",13
"4s/6s in overs 16-20 this IPL

"How many wickets do you think DC will lose in powerplay?

2 or 3?",2
Petition to let DC innings to start from 0/1. Why trouble prithvi?,10
 When boult bowls a ball at 110 kph he becomes krunal pandya.,4
Lol Just saw Northje mocking SKY's *'I am here*' celebration against RCB after getting his wicket.,6
DC: He can't keep getting away with this,2
Someone needs to play fearless cricket like Stokes to even have a chance at winning this,6
"I will be downvoted as hell but Shaw is perfect for this chase, if he fires which he rarely does, he almost certainly takes us home with the momentum. Those 2 match winning knocks showed that",6
"Ishan Kishan is fuckin underrated, fight me!",12
"god I don't understand what's up with Iyer/Ponting saving Nortje and Rabada for the end overs. It's like they don't pay enough attention to the mistakes that have been made in our previous matches. Imo, Nortje should have come after that stoinis over while the pressure was still there.",7
Are DC not coming out lol?,3
"Dhawan alone can't do it. We need Shaw, Iyer and Pant to all go all guns firing and we know that's not gonna happen.",3
"Important note to my fellow SRH fans: Since there's alot of jinxing about us winning tomorrow, we should get our A game in our reverse jinxing.",7
Can’t believe how good Mumbai are,3
Why is 20yr old Bumrah back,6
Why no Pattinson? We have lost more than 6 wickets just twice this entire season. There was no need to keep NCN for his batting.,6
"This season when Hardik bats above Pollard, Pollard performs and when Pollard bats above Hardik, Hardik performs.",8
DC needs a perfect innings. One batsman fucks up and it'll all be over.,1
"Alright guys, predictions? As a MI fan, I think its gonna be close. If < 2 wickets in powerplay, I think dc is good",2
"In the sledge thread DC fans sledged Rohit only and got him, but forgot about 10 others",10
Prithvi needs something stronger than benadryl today.,7
Dhawan scoring century is the only way,3
Chota Ambani cheering and clapping😁😁,5
"There needs to be ton from a DC batter to win this, which certainly not going to happen",2
"how often to BBL stars perform well in IPL?

Darcy Short failed back then
Daniel Sams has failed",4
Fuck Mumbai is too OP. I want a new winner as much the next guy but I would not mind if Mumbai wins. They have dominated this season.,9
Earlier i agreed with everyone who said that rohit should go back to 4. But not anymore. Our top order is inconsequential. The middle needs to be the strongest.,9
"Why doesn't India have a B team with no players from the main side who play the West Indies, Bangaldesh, Sri Lanka series? I don't care if we lose a few games but at least the talent won't go waste.",9
Ambani jr. steadily putting back the weight he lost it seems,7

"hey MI, if you win this match KKR GETS MORAL VICTORY




now just kick bumrah in the nuts and bowl ishan kishan and sky",6
I still think DC can chase this.,6
"DC is fcked.

"Delhi should just go all in. 

Anyway they have a higher chance of winning against SRH/RCB",3
"The people making conspiracy theories about SKY's exclusion from the national team need to up their conspiracy game. Kohli doesn't like him is a meh theory. Most conspiracy theorists of repute would at the very least allege caste based discrimination (there's a Kambli copypasta that reappears or Facebook and the Indian subreddit), and also come up with theories like every team needs to play one uncapped player so Mumbai Indians are blocking SKY's national team selection so that they can fill that spot with SKY who is a very good player, perhaps the best uncapped player out there.",4
"Aight boys see you on Sunday, hope we win that",3

we might be at the bottom of the table but we did beat this team and chase a gargantuan total with boult-bumrah playing + while having a shitty bowling attack apart from archer 😌,23
Ambani jokes in the chat😂😂,4
Dhawan is a true bro of Rohit no RIFT,12
There are spells where boult looks like he is getting a wicket every ball. On his day he is too dangerous,6
Delhi capitals: at least we have another chance in the next game. Let's bring back another fucking vada pav in deshpande.,8
DC top order be like batting tum krlo me Dream 11 pe team bna leta hu,7
tHe ToSs WiNs GaMes,6
"Hulkmani+Pantmania required

N MI wins by 30 runs",5
"Play out Boult and boombox, clear the hand for the other 12 overs",7
"This is the second time these fuckers have come to an exact same situation in this season. Ponting should give them hell honestly, our bowlers have dragged us to the playoffs",9
48 LETS GO 48 LETS GOOO,10
DC's Pant will be removed today,6
Pointing might kill Shaw tonight.,10
What is this team yaar,9
Coulter Nile gonna get tonked today. Should hv played Bulldog instead,8
"""wE wIlL jUsT pLaY oUt bOuLt""",3
Come on 43 runs to go bois,6
Amazing,1
Every other team lucky that we don't have Malinga instead of Pattinson/NCN. Good luck trying to get past a Bumrah-Boult-Slinga trio,11
That Jio nanobots unleashed on the pitch during mid innings seems to be working /s,10
and we thought it was the DC middle order that was fragile...,10
Boult's set up to Rahane was brilliant,2
"Inb4 MI win toss in the final, bat first, low scoring thriller.",8
Ponting would outscore the entire DC team,7
"Hope DC won't play tuk tuk because of wickets, they have to chase 200.",5
Reminder: Boult and de Kock were in Delhi and got dropped because they didn't perform well. It's like no one plays well for Delhi,30
Those were just 3 high class balls its not even dc's fault imo,4
I am supporting MI to get DC 48 all out,3
Dc have their ass handed over to mi.,3
"Thank God I'm not as optimistic as my teen years

I can actually laugh at this embarassment",5
This is a good approach. No point defending now. Do or die.,3
Is there anyway we can get timeout right now?,2
Only way DC top order can be reliable is if Ricky Ponting himself bats at No.3,10
"Arey har gaye,50 sein phele out ho jao, thoda acche sein haro",4
Get all out for less than 49 or score min 180 and make this little bit interesting. No in between.,8
Scenes if Shreyas scores a century and wins it for DC lol,8
Shreyas INTENT Iyer,3
"Getting India vs NZ semifinal vibes.

We also have a budget Jadeja.",12
Most of the selected batsman are playing trash while those not selected are trashing others.,4
I kinda wish there was an option for a team to just concede defeat to save us all some time and pain.,6
"MI winning IPL again

I am tired Robbie",7
MI will defend their title after all! They're just a touch above everyone else right now.,7
Incoming Pant 180(60) to take DC to a glorious win,11
"Even this match DC will score 49+ 

this shows how weird RCB were batting on that day

they were on fucking 40/4 then lost 6 wickets",12
"If Iyer is not out until 15 over, we might as well call off the match! He is dangerous!!",2
"Even DC shows Pant is shit now, sent Stoinis over Pant",8
"just joined in, wth happened",3
If Another wicket goes down punter should come in.,5
They bowl 8 overs of Boult and bumrah...DC will be bowled out,5
"3-4 years from now, IPL will turn into Mumbai Premier League. This team has no loopholes. I don't think it even needs a captain anymore.",11
"Every time a batting team has an horriawful start, they just give blue balls to RCB fans and then go on to lose by huge margin while scoring marginally above 49.",6
"Iyer showing intent in PP. Interesting, Very Interesting",3
If only Boult had shown this skill in world cup final,2
"Need to get stoinis early, that guy can score big.",3
It is still chaseable guys,3
Okay Shreyas,6
"Next match team sheet

Out : Shaw
In : Ponting",14
Anyone else remember Iyer dancing around while batting in Nz this year,3
"Look I'm just gonna say, if Mumbai wanna get our best bowler and our best finisher in red hot form before the T20 World Cup, I don't have any problems",18
who hurt you iyer?,6
Lets goo iyer!!,1
Nah man they gon go past 49,7
35 runs to go,1
Thank fuck at least he is counter attacking today and not going in a hole like we used to in previous games,2
MI was withholding their most potent weapon for the playoffs. It's the prayer aunty doing this.,23
This is not all that bad for DC. It could be a lot worse; they could have that ginger cunt Stokes in their team.,1
Fuck man we’re leaking runs,-2
"If these two play until 19.5 overs, DC have a chance.",7
Goes on to show how important it is to give new ball to your best bowler!!!,2
lord Tewatia needs to send his powers to Delhi. No other way they win this,3
getting a bad feeling that iyer will be out soon,2
Why has Hardik not been bowling? Injury?,7
"4 most experienced batsmen rohit, dhawan, pollard and rahane all out for 0",14
This game is over right,3
Get shaw the fuck out of the team. Open with stoinis and hetmyer in for sams. Or maybe alex carey instead of hetmyer. Rahane goes out for harshal patel/deshpandey.,4
The difference between MI and DC is so much Pranav Dhanawade is getting nostalgia watching this game,5
"Cmon crack some iyer jokes now

Is he asking Pointing where to hit Now?",10
The last time I saw a match being killed this early in the chase was in the 2003 final.,13
Iyer needs to put on a real show today. Chance to shut all critics ques his selection..,8
Sorry but that was a shitty ball from Boult on 2.5. Short and way outside off.,2
post match thread is up,9
"Bruh if I was Iyer I'd have cried right there by now. 

Get us home captain.",8
This innings will have effect on NRR of DC. Need to get closer to total,2
Ponting : Welp Ima head out,6
"Proud DD-DC fan, 12 years running. I'll take anything above wooden spoon as a fantastic season. See ya in 6 months!!!",10
God bless who ever thought of a mega auction.,11
"This is the difference in strategy, MI bowling there 2 best pace bowlers at start and DC keeps holding Rabada and Nokia and opens with Sam's and Ashwin..",3
Does Dhawan now have the most number of ducks in a season?,2
Has any team in IPL ever lost 3 wickets for no run?,2
"Wow, this DC collapse makes me feel  better as a KKR fan.",7
"Boult

&#x200B;

Most Powerplay wickets.

Bowler with most boundaries hit against.

Perfectly balanced",29
*WE ARE DELHI DAREDEVILS CAPITALS BUT THE CAPITALS IS SILENT*,15
This is Iyer vs Surya.,4
"Fuck this shitty team. I didn't have much hope the would clinch this, and all the hope was based around a choke from Mumbai, but what the fuck is this? I hope Mumbai bowls them out for less than 49, the team deserves to be the laughingstock of the IPL, not RCB. This is a shitty team in and out full of players with all talent but no hunger to win. I wish I could steal a living in broad daylight as these chucklefucks have.",16
We are just too OP lmao,5
Get pointing in now!,4
DC are MIs B team,5
Was my dinner break so long that 3 wickets fell,2
"Let's be honest here DC ain't winning this. I'll only say this, do the mega auction ASAP. Can't have MI winning the trophy next year too with this broken team",9
One sided matches continue. After the initial months of excitement all the matches since the past week have been dull affairs.,5
[deleted],7
This IPL is rigged. What is the point of coming 2nd in the league table when you have to play against MI,3
"*After one more wicket falls, everyone looks towards the dugout, waiting to see who will walk out into this cauldron, with the team facing the monumental target of 200*


BAH GOD, THAT'S PONTING AND GANGULY'S MUSIC",14
I'm from Mumbai and remember Shaw being in the news all the time. Really sad the way things have turned out.,3
Ishan kishan is going to be part of 2023 wc team . Dont @ me,10
"Wickets lost in over #1 in #IPL2020 

9 DC (Shaw 5, Dhawan 2, Rahane 2)
3 MI/CSK
2 RR/SRH/KKR
1 RCB/KXIP",10
Iyer and Stoinis to do a Stokes-Sanju?,3
"So, DC has a messed up top order, SRH has batting till 4 and RCB has middle order accumulators till 5 down. Guess it's MI again this year!",14
Kkr fans punching the air rn 💀💀,13
The only thing MI is missing is a world class spinner..imagine if MI gets rashid khan.,9
Present day MI is 2000s Australia,10
Only Warner can prevent MI from winning this IPL.,23
 RCB is destined to retain the 49 forever :(,27
Dread it. Run from it. MI still arrives.,9
Dugout is such a pleasure to watch,6
So eliminator and Q2 are just formalities?,16
Someone SERIOUSLY jinxed DC at their peak.,10
This kinda start is not something you get over,8
woah Rohit rarely gives second over to Bumrah in the powerplay,8
Rohit going for the kill,9
MI just took their final league game defeat to heart,16
DC will win this ..you heard it here first,4
"DC have absolutely nothing to lose now. A good counter-attack could turn the tide and get them going here. If not, they always have a second chance in the qualifier 2.",5
Lmao Shaw's father has a better hairline than him.,8
"The real winner today is the Australian bowling that will bowl to the likes of Rohit, Rahane, Shaw & Dhawan.",19
"Shaw: *comes into crease

Shaw 2 seconds later: Aight I'm out.",26
" I always imagine that just after he backs away but before he swings the bat, Shreyas Iyer yells out 'JAI MAHARASHTRA'.",9
"They said at the start of DC innings - ""DC have nothing to lose"". I was like WTF. They had future vision, now I know what they meant...",2
"Stoinis gonna hit 120(50) today, with the power of Adam zampa's friendship (????)",7
Any chance virat leaves Bengaluru and plays for DC like gambhir and dhawan?,6
MI always has a substitute fielder on - Anukul Roy. For whom? And this is allowed without a legitimate injury??,5
Shaw needs to take a good look at himself.,3
[deleted],-7
"This is why as a RCB fan I'm afraid of RCB chasing in knockouts. I know conditions and stats favor fielding first .But keeping RCB team in mind, batting first will be a good option else if we end up  like Delhi  with 3 down for 10 odd ,Delhi might still have a chance as they have few good players, but  for RCB its game over.",3
Atleast my 10 coins ain't going to waste,5
Rohit looks like the professor from money heist,7
"Why not just go all out right now, it's not like NRR matters. Can't take any time to settle, and might get lucky hitting a few while settling down",2
Ambani ka darshan,2
That chubby innocent looking boy is going to run India one day,8
India need to bring in Suryakumar and Kishan into their T20 team.,10
I wonder whether the Ambanis had to stay in quarantine for 14 days?!!,5
"This reminds me of the match between Delhi and Mumbai in 2017

Mumbai posted a below par total of 142 

In reply Delhi were 21-6",10
"Whitehat junior ad: coders hi hain, the hope of generations. (coders are the hope of generations) 

Me: if you think unwashed, unsexed coders slaving away in IT companies around the country are the hope of generations, I got some big fuckin news for ya.",7
The madam herself is here. No way they'll lose,3
Is Shreyas from a Tamil family?,1
"if MI wins this,who would get MOM? Unless DC gets close to winning this and a bowler pulls it can a batter should get the MOM.",2
Hardik shining like peak Jayasuriya.,4
"If Nortje and Stoinis value their efforts/want more money they should switch over to another team, because they’re just getting wasted here.",1
Lol Shikhar costing Rahane his wicket,1
Save me the pain and don’t make the playoffs next time. This hurts deeper man!,5
"My Whatsapp status section is already flooded with MI statuses 

No man not again  :)",12
[deleted],-2
We ourselves are to blame for the Bumrah-Bolt combo. Should never have let Trent go.,12
Bum Bum getting his purple cap back,4
Haha DC fans are hurt by this performance.,2
Prithwi shaw is the next Unmukt Chand,10
"Shaw has hype of SRT, Swagger of Richards, Attitude of ponting and batting of Maninder Singh",12
[deleted],13
Big Stoin just want to protect iyer from Bumrah by hard no to the singles,3
I bet shaw makes into team India before sky will.,13
Donate some money to the poor you rich cunt ambanis,-6
take a shot every time they replay those three wickets,4
Petition to get Stoinis a day away with Zampa if he wins it for us,12
Ripped shoes,2
Neeta Ambani looks cringy to me,4
"Between the three, Shaw’s dismissal was the unforgivable one. He’s an opening batsman. He can afford to leave it. The other two got sensational deliveries.",12
How is Anukul Roy in the field every game xD,3
"Calling it right now. Mumbai win this game, Hyderabad defeat both Rcb and DC to reach the finals. Finals is a low scoring thriller, and team batting first wins by one run. So basically the team losing the toss wins the finals.",14
"Sunrisers, capitals and ***MUMBAI***",6
"Should have sent Pant when DC lost 2 in first over, that was a golden chance to give pant the go after bowling license",7
They should just send Ponting next...,12
Would have liked to see RR in the knockouts. Only kryptonite of MI,12
MI chill the fuck out. There's no NRR to destroy over here,9
Bumrah looking straight into our soul!,4
We need another wicket man,2
We should all thank SRH for waking MI up. Now good luck hoping to win the IPL if you are a non-IPL fan 😒,5
Shottttt,1
Delhi deliberately losing this so Rabada has more chances at Purple Cap,7
That was a sexy shot,1
Incoming ashwin 100*,6
"Good captaincy, giving Bumrah a second over. Will just make it harder to chase.",3
Top class!!,1
I will never get tired of beautiful cover drives,3
Wait no Iyer you can't do that,1
No RR to be worried about. Go Berserk or anyways it is looking like going to Qualifier 2                                                           Edit- fuck,3

SS Iyer c Sharma b Bumrah 12 (8b 3x4 0x6) SR: 150.00",6
This is a bad prank on the DC fans,10
Irrespective of form rohit sharma look ok fit though,5
29 more 🤞,3
No fault of iyer. This is all on the top 3.,11
48 all out still in menu or what?,9
Oh ffs DC. If you are going to collapse do it before 49. Don't just give us hope and then take it away,9
From 0-3 to 20-4??? Mumbai crumbling ^/s,10
"What the hell happened to Shaw ? Ideally I would make fun of him , but I just feel sad for him now . Was supposed to be the next big thing .",5
"Stay calm, RCB fans there's still a chance",9

Honestly prefer this from Iyer than his fuck all tuk tuk 30(28) stat padding anchoring. Was fun to watch.,7
Pant Redemption innings incoming?,1
I was confused between Hathway or Jio broadband. Now I'm definitely buying Jio,4
Better to get out in Eliminator than to face this humiliation,12
Burmah is now again the Highest wicket taker even though he was rested for 1 match!,9
Fuck yes Bumrah!!!!!,2
This Shreyas Iyer is another over hyped player,0
Minimal footwork from Iyer while hitting in the covers! I wonder how much control can he have. He is bound to edge it or hit it in the air more often with that lack of balance.,6
I really hope we don't get the same match in the final . Mumbai have gor DCs number,3

Poor KKR watching Bumrah and Boult running riot today,15
Intent from Iyer = 3 fours,9

"Fuck MI but come on lads

Save us🙏🙏

Get them for 48",10
As a rcb fan only thing I'm thinking about is 48 all out,11

alternative to reddit stream for desktop?,2

Rohit showing his fitness with that jump.,7
TCS has the best ad this IPL,3
20 - 4  dc cannot chase 200 now so might as well just break some records . Cough 49 cough.,9
So who's TCS targeting with those TV ads?,6
Was getting surprised seeing iyer play well against fast bowler. Finally  restored my faith!,8
Just finish Bumrah’s and Boult’s over now.,6
Can’t remember a single time a team lost 4 wickets in powerplay and went on to chase 200,6
Man we finally had a good number 4 in limited overs and Iyer started playing like this in IPL  :(,7

Sheryas still needs temperament and control.,3
Inb4 Pant 180*,3
"I just feel fucking bad for Dehli now. At least they have another chance at getting to the finals. I think this just shows how important Pandya, Boult and Bumrah are to Mumbai though.

What’s with the hype around Shreyas Iyer? always looks tentative in pressure matches and an extremely poor body language . Just replace him with SKY in the ODI setup .,0
inb4 48,1
Delhi Chokers😂😂👌🏾,1
Rohit caught that like it was a vada pav,5
DC needs to be sensible here. Save the nrr now at least.,2
So basically the only team which can defeat MI is SRH currently,4
"Everytime I look away from my stream, a wicket falls",2
How are they gonna come back from this loss? Absolutely dismantled them,2
Just bowl out Boult and Bumrah. Finish the game within 8 overs. Ffs why Krunal.,5
Chahal's fiance is good looking,3
if krunal doesnt get a wicket this over ;-;,2
Bowl out Bumrah and Boult pls Rohit🙏🙏,3
Noooooo where's Boulty 🥺,3
[deleted],6
Please get to 50/10 so I can sleep peacefully.,7
Will DC lose by more or less than 100 runs?,3
"MI isn't trying to just win the match, MI is instilling fear",15
One of those two have to play an absolute blinder here today... Somewhere close to a hundred?,4
Today's score DC = velocity,6
"DC seeing how well MI's middle order played, let's try that.",5
It’s not over until Pant and Stoinois are back in the pavilion,5
Where are my “Delhi will play against Mumbai in finals “ squad?,6
Just in : Sehwag and Kevin Pietersen to come in next,4
Rahane wicket although umpires call looked out in real time. The players movement makes a big difference in perception.,7
When was the last close game?,6
"*early wickets fall in the powerplay*

Everyone: 49?",13
"Man I knew this was going to happen since yesterday. Still hoped for a miracle.
DC, it was good while it lasted",6
">So just the one ball for Bumrah to Pant this over. Will Mumbai give him one more in the Powerplay if Pant is still unbeaten at the start of the sixth over?

Cricinfo guy doesn't have faith",10
"It took all of 8 overs - the last 4 of Mumbai's innings and the first 4 of Delhi's, to destroy what was looking an even contest.",8
Bowl bumrah and boult for 8 ovevs straight. Finish them off.,10
"Stoin 100* anyone?
Even In a losing cause  for the MI fans.",6
[removed],8
"Early wickets by Boult, one of them being LBW. Other two top wickets were caught behind and bowled. Then the fourth wicket was caught playing cover drive. This is like, very very similar to Ind vs NZ semis.

Tie in the finals confirmed",7
Management gonna release this entire DC team and start from scratch.,3
How the MI  franchise has been built indicates why the Ambanis are one of the most successful business moguls in the world.,4
KP bowling tight,4
We would’ve at least put up a little fight!!,2
"Since there is no net run rate to take care of, shouldn't they just try to get a move on?

Will be interesting to see DC's approach!",3
I don't think DC will mentally be able to recover from this beating. Whichever team win the eliminator-1 will have a good chance of making finals.,11
"Thank fucking god, i would have cried if that was caught",9
Lol wtf Pandu?! That was the moment for RCB fans,8
WTF Pandya u stupid cunt,9
Damn,3
Hardik dropped the match right there,16
49 collapse was incoming,3
Should have taken it. That would have been game over.,4
Pandya wants 50 all out,6
The only way to beat this Mumbai team is with a bat when they are sleeping,3
Fuckkk drop catch,6
RCB would have given us a better fight plus the memes and VK SKY banter,9
Weellll fuck,2
Even DC aiming for that 49,3
Misjudged it completely bruh,3
"RCB can beat DC, but I'm not sure they can beat SRH. Next match is going to be interesting.",4
That's a terrible drop,1
Thats an easy catch for Hardik,4
Hardik did that deliberately /s,9
Appreciate Koach's foresight. Didn't want us to go through this degree of humiliation against MI again and let Delhi take the heat.,16
CSK should've won more titles before itself. 8 chances and only 3 titles. Now we can never even catch up to MI.,5
Sallright Pandya you've done enuf.,3
I'm curious as to how MI is allowed to have the ponytail guy fielding in literally every match even though he isn't in the playing 11. Is this legal?,1
Hardik wtf that's your bro,7
"25 more runs to go, DC",2
"Looks like Iyer, Shaw and Rahane just remembered they were from Mumbai.",3
no 48 all out :(,2
"Good guy Pandya jnr. 

Dropping catches to ensure Delhi get to 49",3
Come on hardick,2
RCB fans can now blame Pandya,2
"Hardik drops it to make the game interesting

/s",3
that was lucky af,4
Hardik Pandya or Sabu from Chacha Chaudhary?,2
"Damn, I miss Amit mishra, obviously our batting is straight up inconsistent, but he could take wickets whenever we needed. The score could've been less than 180 if he were there",8
Stoinis picking the fielders to perfection.,5
[deleted],13
"Iyer ""we let them get 150 runs too many"" incoming",61
Stoinis to score 149 and then get run out,10
Gujratis and Ambani the match made in heaven if you know what I mean 🌝,8
Pandya catch pakad saale,6
He couldn’t catch it. Too much light bouncing off his head,10
10 overs ago MI were 108/4 after 14 overs and this was an even game,14
Pandya to Pandya: Tu ghar pe mil,10
"Delhi Capitals win a match : shares dressing room special players awards and Ponting speech on YouTube

Delhi Capitals loose a match : we don't have a Youtube channel",36
Why does Mark Nicholas go on a funeral eulogy everytime a wicket falls down?,8
why do they drop Patto? Has he not been performing?,3
"Can’t bat, can’t bowl, just missed the Shaw drop catch in this performance!",4
Smh younger siblings always tryna push down older siblings,7
"Impressive shithousery from DC, this.",2
Qualifier2 - I would like to see RCB v DC. Both teams trying their best to lose the match would be entertaining :D,11
Lmao Krunal goes for just 5,7
Hardik saving DC from <49 all out,8
Only KKR can be forgiven for playing a game like this against MI in a playoff  this is worse,8
Rare sight of Hardik dropping a catch.,6
Thank you dc for winning against us,8
Please DC cross that 49 runs mark ffs (not jinxing) I don't want to see DC face that humiliation that's it :),3
In retrospect Ashwin was great today,7
Why MI always has that substitute fielder,5
Fuckboi saving delhi from <49 all out,10
Go for the kill dafuq is this,4
RRR reaching 12 lol. 4 overs b/w Boult Bumrah left. Start hitting now,6
What does DC have to lose anyway? Is there anything by name of intent in this team or just a bunch of pussies out there in the field.,2
People complaining about Delhi: did you see those deliveries? Plz nerf mi,5
Pant will hit 200 inshallah xD,7
NCN you gon throw pies today orrrrr,3
"Pant, Shaw and Iyer are not even the future of DC, let alone Indian cricket",3
Axar already padded up omg,3
It really is a great looking trophy. Defiantly wasn't the same company that makes the plastic F1 trophies.,3
[removed],3
Should've given one more over to Boult...,1
"Classic flashback to rr game Hardik played well then dropped a catch of stokes , which proved dangerous hope it's not case here",2
Forfeit kar do yaar. Itni bezzati kum hai?,3
"SRH vs DC will be easy for SRH.

Morris is injured as can be seen in RCB’s video, he can’t even walk without support. So that is easy win for SRH.",4
Return  of the Pant?,1
"Alright, NCN is here, now DC can score some.",3

It’s time to change your flairs( this is for all the recent overconfident fan base that rose out of nowhere),7
25(31) from pant incoming,5
I'm now convinced that sky is the best batsman to ever pick up the bat. BCCI should clone him and replace the current batsmen in the squad with his clones,3
Just tuned in after the break. Wtf happened here.. did I tune into 2013 season??,8
Kurnal isn't going to let Hardik live that down for the rest of his life.,7
Looking forward to a sensible™ 26(35) from Pant now,5
Just put them out of their misery.,2
Pant doing some test match timings. Nice,2
Who else thinks SRH is the only team that can atleast give tough fight to MI?,2
Pant with his usual tuk tuk in a fucking 200 chase,1
"Hardik, don’t bring sibling rivalry into the field.",5
Everyone keeps talking about our batting and bowling but our fielding is top notch as well,5
I expect Pant to score a 40+ score here.,3
Thala Pant,3
Man I'm fucking scared what's gonna happen tomorrow,6
declare the innings,3
DC shouldn't  have RCB qualify and should have gone for 17.3,1
Tbh Bumrah has been bowling miles better than Rabada since about game 8 or 9. Just had to catch up due to his horrible start.,11
MI winning this season again will be the worst ending to this best rollercoaster of a season.,8
"Don't they have coach interview in the middle of the game when their team is shitting the bed.

Give me ponting now.",9
The worst thing about Delhi is that their batting is totally dependent on Indian players who fail collectively and bowling is dependent on foreign pacers who now seem to follow the lead of their batters.,8
Hardik's head is fuckin weird lol.,13
Are we getting back Jason Roy next season?,5
[removed],9
Is it just me or the Dubai Expo ads are annoying af now,10
"Pant is just a walking wicket, no threat whatsover!",3
What an opportunity for Sams to get his maiden IPL 50,11
Is Pandya high on banana?,6

for the Sub the target now is 50 lmaooo,10
"This MI team is carried so hard by Rohit, QDK, SKY, Kishan, Pollard, Pandya, Pandya, NCN, Boult, Chahar, and Bumrah, wtf???!?",15
"Every passing day, Pandya is becoming more likeable. Taklu maast hai.",10
I'd rather listen to Sanju Manju than Mark Nicholas,1
"If Hardik doesn't play cricket, everyone take him for a junkie.",9
"I want to see Ponting's speech today, DC please.",9
"Bruh ideally you would want to settle in but the score you are chasing is 201, pls hit big. Iyer was trying to do that atleast",10
Can’t relax until Pant or Stoinis get out,1
"Even now the strategy makes no sense as always. Just go for it, there is nothing to lose.",6
What just happened here,4
"Sky not selected in aus series ...scores streaks of 50 scores .
Pant selected in test squad ..please don't play like test.",6
thank god they didnt play Bumrah and Boult against us,16
I feel Sky wouldn't have got this recognition if he was still with kk,3
Pant with a superior block,3
"Pant plays so slow, but is blamed for his poor shot selection. Lmao",5
"Mumbai can play Lynn in place of NCN and make Harddkik bowl NCN's quota.
Use Lynn like a wildcard in batting lineup , surprise hitting in 10-15 over",-1
Pant will be gone under 10 runs.,1
"Genuine question: who tf needs an ad for Dubai Expo to decide, ""Haan bc chalte hain"".",10
[deleted],6
How and when did DC lose 4 wickets?,5
"NCN is here

Destroyer in chief of 49 all out",8
I fear IPL won't be IPL anymore. There is no competition. MI wiil again retain these highly experienced uncapped players. Maybe that's why Surya wasn't picked.,8
"Stoinis be like, ""pant, you really think you're going to make that run?""",8
Rcb fans felling feeling absolutely lucky and delightful for losing to dc,6
Pandya dropped catch so that DC would cross 49.Pandya just wants to get back at Morris /s,10
SRH has an easy road to the final,4
Will Pant earn r/cricket 's love back if he wins this for Delhi?,9
Pant showing why he was picked for the test team and dropped for the white ball ones,4
Does it rain this time around in Dubai ? Coz none other than rain can save delhi,2
"KKR fans can have their closure

Its not that Delhi played slow intentionally vs RCB...they're just shit",15
Who took 4 wickets ?,2
The only thing which would have been great if RCB was playing today are the memes. Really missing them.,2
Can any explain why captains change the spell when two bowlers are just killing it from any where? I see this everytime when a bowler is just taking back to wickets the captain just bring in new bowler.,10
MI is too OP. Feel for pant. So many such collapses this season and he hasn't been able to play his natural game.,7
So shud we need the remaining matches or give it to MI now and be done with it ?,4
Now everyone will find a way to blame pant for this,7
"apology for poor english

when were you when DC dies?

i was sat at home eating Vada pav when phine ring

""DC is kill""

""No""",24
Why is everyone assuming SRH will beat RCB ?,6
"I feel Pant’s pain everyone. That feeling of going out there only to not connect with anything, not time anything. The feeling of being out of form is a horrible one.",7
"Mumbai is to reluctant to make changes to their bowling attack, should've sent Boult for one more over since they've already gotten 4. It's not like they need to finish the match early but still",3
Please DC don't panic cross that 49 runs mark please trust me if you don't you will have to face a lot of humiliation,9
"Pant dont listen to Ponting, just practice for the Border Gavaskar series",24
What is Pant trying to do here?,3
Ankul roy fielding 🔥,10
"BC if you are batting defensive anyway, why not do it against Boult and Bumrah where it actually makes sense?

No that would be too smart for us.",8
Wtf Anukul back at it again.,1
Pant is one of the ugliest batsmen to watch.,1
Pant's habit of wandering down the pitch for non-existent singles is fucking weird.,7
DC batsmen getting some much needed practice before the second eliminator,9
Anucool our specialist fielder,11
"Pant is like 10,12 years younger then Rohit but has a same belly as him",4
Anukul👋🏽👋🏽👏🏽👏🏽,3
The only people worse than Shaw and Rahane in this whole thing are the Mumbai Indian dick riders in the comment thread. There's something despicable in supporting the stronger team. These are the same people who clap at unforced errors by Federer's opponents or support Chennai despite not being from Chennai. Aathooo!,-7
[removed],13
I can see Pant’s stomach through his shirt. The lad needs to work on his fitness. He is freaking 23 only,9
Anukul Roy is the best non playing fielder.,8
Even substitutes are doing good fielding,5
Is Shaw the next Haseeb Hameed?,4
[deleted],1
"One thing I’ve noticed, Hardik absolutely sprays anyone who misfields. Always hated the bloke like that at the Uni who thought it made him the leader and bearer of standards.",1
Has Ankul Roy taken the title of specialist fielder from Pandeyji?,6
How is Anukul Roy always on the field,3
"MI even has the best 12th man. What a fielding Anukul.

Only Pawan Negi of RCB comes close!",9
DC slowly killing all RCB fans hopes,7
How many people here will be like 'wicket slowed down'?,4
Ye Anukul Roy har game fielding karna aata h kya?,7
173 from 85 balls,4
"Must feel weird to be in the shoes of Coulter-Nile. On one hand you won't be noticed if you do badly due to the bowling lineup, but your good performances would also go unnoticed due to the same bowling lineup.",6
"i think pant should forget most of the last year and a half and go freestyle .his natural game ...

Might as well get them a bunch of runs before the 5th falls... if he tries to hold I dont think it will work",3
"Ah, MI's specialist fielder",8
I will take a taking it deep situation only for this match,2
Sharma could come on to bowl after 8. Max humiliation.,5
"Have seen Anukul Roy fielding every now and then. Sad he didn't get a game :(

Even Tare, Anmolpreet, Mitch 

Jayant got just the one match",5
"At this point the only counter attack pant can launch is on the vada pavs, Rohit Sharma is hoarding",8
No 49 :(,9
Stoinis with a BBL knock to save the day please. That would be entertaining as fuck,7

"Imagine DC loosing today,  winning the second playoff  and coming back in the final to play against.... MI!!!


 That'd  be most excellent dude's!!!",13
Should've given boult another over.,3
Pls tell me anukul roy the specialist fielder gets paid/bonus for his fielding. Poor guy can't get a properr game in this monster of a team,9
Mukesh Adani must be gutted he won't be able to retain an entire team in the next auction.,5
STOP THE ~~COUNT~~ Wickets,13
How many runs to avoid Follow On?,33
"DC: ""We wanted to play the extra game to try out some tactics. All part of the plan..""",16
Is Ankul in for Ishan?,3
The scoreboard looks like it belongs to a team playing school cricket.,6
Pant needs to recreate that Raina innings of 87(25) against kxip in the qualifiers,12
"Cross 49, and I'm good. We had a good season.",4
We always give away wickets to opposition best bowlers which means we have no management lol.,2
Dc missing one Jason Roy!,4
"Come one stoinis, destroy them with your physical advantage",7
"Dc is gone, we brought on our best bowler",8
Why tf is Pollard bowling.,5
Pollard is unnecessary now Rohit,5
This over has to go!,2
Man at this rate Ponting will need to consult a psychiatrist,15
I can't believe this shit.,3
Pant and his tuk tuk.. fuckn hit the ball..,2
"Specialist fielder buys of IPL 2020

1. Pawan Negi  - RCB

2. Suchith - KXIP

3. Ankul Roy - MI",8
Krunal bowls faster than pollard sometimes,5
I see that CSK has indeed made it to the playoffs,11
Idiot pant will defend easy bowlers and go after Bumrah and get out lol,8
Ponting should spit on these players like he did during his whole career on the pitch,8
stoinis is atleast trying i'll give him that,6
"DC hammered CSK and RR, indirectly got KXIP eliminated, and then, they shit the bed like this in Qualifiers? 

I guess I understand how RR/KXIP fans used to feel about CSK qualifying earlier.",5
Lmao now MI is using this as an opportunity to get in bowling practice for Pollard,6
Wtf injury risk for Pollard man,2
Bring Bumrah back for Pant,3
Why pollard?,2
Pant used to cunt balls like these. Good lord. Fuck this,7
DC needs 18 to win against RCB,6
We are literally trolling DC by bowling Polly lol,6
Rohit just teasing DC by bowling Polly lol,3
Anukul Roy- Specialist Sub/Fielder,2
[deleted],11
wenger out,1
One second what about the dew?,5
DC missed a trick by not resting Nortje and Rabada this year.,7
Lmao Pant is actually practising for the test series,6
Can the BCCI appoint a therapist for Pointing at this point? Feel bad for him,8
"Who gives a shit about 49, this is an embarrassment anyway. Just go for it.",5
I love Pollard's on field Expression. Lol,4
"Rohit just choke them out, why krunal and pollard?",5
"This a whole kind of flexing, Pollard is bowling to prove how fucked DC are",7
MI is just meme-ing at this point,4
"This is what happens when other teams give away their good players to MI for free.

DC gave away Boult for money

RCB released De Kock

KKR released Suryakumar Yadav



Up next: RR releases Archer and gifts it to MI


MI management isn't smart, other team's managements are chutiyas",18
"Seeing Pant like this is genuinely heartbreaking, ik he is settling in or whatever but this has been what he has been doing this entire season.",5
Man what the fuck is Pant doing,2

What did they do to Pant man? He’s too careful now,2
I really want to know what Pant is thinking right now,2
DC fans still lingering in the thread?,3
Rishab Farzi Pant,1
What has happened to you my dear Pant? Where's the aggression?,4
Peak 2020 when MI wins in even year,8
I love watching Pollard bowl. It's like watching a large gentle beast amble in,6
"We have a saying here,
""Iske haath me sone ka katora dedo, fir bhi maangni inko bheekh hee hai""

Translation: ""Give this man a gold cup & he will still use it to beg""


Delhi Capitals apts this perfectly.
:/",6
Lol. Rohit brought on Pollard to rest bumrah and Boult for the finals. He'll probably bowl the next over himself.,12
"If Hardik could bowl, they might be the complete team.",10
"My Grandmother has more footwork than Prithvi shaw. 
God rest her soul",14
MI really wants RCB to have the record #RIFT,2
"If Rishabh Pant gets a hundred today, will KL Rahul be automatically declared injured for the Australian tour?",2
pointings australian team was almost invincible. Feel bad for him that he has to mentor this crumbling shit,1
"Losing is fine with me , but this is just embarrassing 😳",3
Pant has wholeheartedly embraced the test specialist tag.,2
Fuck off man I'll say it. All this pLaY sEnSiBLY talks from dumbass indian cricket fans and pundits alike fucked up a generational talent like Pant. I absolutely enjoyed how we got tonked by NZ in the semi. We don't deserve anything with some donkey brained personnel leading the way.,9

Rohit bowl now and take a hattrick pls.,4
Unpopular opinion: Rohika > Virushka,7
Shows how dead this game is when there's a big discussion on the bowler's run up.,14
"Scotty, Stoinis did open today :)",10
"Velocity, momentum, run up👏🏽👏🏽",4
Cant imagine the pressure on Stonis,0
Ah finally discussing Marcus Stoinis opening the batting which I was calling for since the beginning of the tournament.,4
DC management will be a big joke if they still play Shaw in the next match.,6
How did DC even qualify for the playoffs btw?,2
"Why isnt the former hattrick hero rohit not bowling , opponents not worthy of facing him ?",11
Somebody remind these lads that NRR no longer matters. Better to go hell  for leather right now.,8
They really ruined Pant.,3
"Samson, SKY > 100000 x Pant",7

Now MI are trolling DC by bowling Pollard.,6
Rohit making Pollard bowl to make the game interesting,6
Polly has such an uncle type action,7
"Need a Vintage Pant, yes this is a 23 year old",9
Polly looks like that uncle bowling those dolly balls to the kids in street cricket,3
Not even hitting Pollard.. idiots..,6
Mumbai will either get the best players or get the best out of the players,14
[deleted],5
"Rohit wants to stay out for all 20 overs to showcase his fitness. 


That's the only explanation for this bowling selection.",6
"Starc and Hazlewood licking their lips thinking about bowling to Shaw, Rahane, and out of form Dhawan + Rohit.",8
"cmon DC, dont make it a snoozefest",1
Reminder that Delhi replaced Roy with Sams,10
Opinion (dont know if popular/ unpopular): Pollard is a shit bowler who shouldnt bowl. He doesnt have any variation except going wide on the crease. Only place he can remotely perform well is on slow 120-130 pitches.,2
Delhi can comeback strong next match don't worry you delhi fans,6
Watching Pollard bowl is no soothing. Chillest action ever.,2
Shaw cannot be allowed to open in Australia.,11
Roy’s fielding is electric,7
"Man imagine ICC starts fucking with bumrah's action like they do with naraine, hope they don't ever.",4
Just on pure aesthetic sense ishan kishan and sanju are both better than pant. Plus better keepers,10
Where is the intent **TM**?,1
Are they fucking planning to start slogging after reaching 49 or what,8
"Pant trying save the nRR....., Oh wait.",3
"Why r they not attacking

There is no NRR in playoffs come on",6
Lmao Pant has given up,8
"We were all like, "" 2020 is a strange year, RCB might win this time"" and nobody thought MI can win in even.",27
What’s the plan here exactly boys?,7
Pollard taunting Pant,3
Pant has been an absolute disaster this season,4
"Correct me if I am wrong, but I miss Pant's uncivilised hitting rather than this sensible buffoonery.",28
I know its very comfortable but I don’t feel safe until Stoinis is out,5
Pant is playing test practice now,3
"Bumrah runs like a fawn/foal through the meadows. I really worried about how injury prone he would be. Turns out, not much more than the others.",8
Oh ok.. We are playing for the RR... Wait..,10
"Cant hit Boult, Bumrah. Dont hit Pollard and Krunal also. Great",15
Pollard is bowling with the seriousness he has when he bowls to his kids in his backyard 🤦‍♂️,12
Isn’t pollard chucking,1
Now I want to know Archer's runup speed vs someone like Brett Lee or Shoaib,10
Top 3 scored 0 collectively and r/cricket is pissed at Pant for trying to settle down.,24
3 off 8. Ha betichod aur araam se khel 2 din hai apne paas,7
MI in cahoots with broadcasters and are extending the game time for them,7
Are they trolling DC? Just end their misery,7
Man seeing Lynn in that bench uniform made me sad :/,6
Why even bother showing D/L score in Dubai??,7
"12 runs to go lads, get Stoinis and we are in the game",7
I think Ponting will tell Pant to just clear his mind and play his wish rather than for the result. Better have Pant ready for the Qualifier 2 if loss is certain.,13
[deleted],11
Wth Kishan injured ? Hope nothing serious,5
"Taking Pollard for 4 runs is such fucking rubbish. You have no nRR to worry about, try to win the game ffs.",11
"If you can't score against Pollard, then you are fucked.",10
DC taking those important singles.,7
"Aggressive batsman : Jason Roy

Aggressive fielder : Ankul Roy",18

I wish RCB- B made it to play offs :'(,8
"As much as I love this Mumbai team and hate the Mega auction, new players haven't been discovered this season

Probably the same Eleven players will play  next season as well (Nothing wrong with it, everyone is here to win)",11
"Dear Indian cricket fans on facebook and twitter,  
  
Fuck you for ruining Pant.",13
It's not like Pant is trying to hit the ball and not middling... He's just defending it... Nobody knows what he has in mind,6
"Someone tell dc that the league stage is over , nrr doesnt matter now, go slog dumbfucks",9
"There's no NRR here fuckers, go hard or go home. What's the point of defending anyway.",15
At least tonk Pollard ffs,6
"peak 2020 would be RCB beating SRH, DC and THIS MI to win the IPL",13
It was Rohit Sharma who backed Sanju Samson to get into the Indian team [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPP8CdAirhc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPP8CdAirhc)  @0.34,4
Just turned the TV on. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH DC?,9
This is just MI torturing their prey before the kill.,11
Anyone thinks Delhi can make a game out of this? These are have the ability I think,1
Did they really see off Pollard's dibbly dobblies when the RRR is 13+? What do you have to lose at this point?,7
Mi should really go for the kill right now by bowling Boult and bumrah. It would really dent DC's confidence in case they face them again in finals.,16
Looks like ponting is padding up ;),13
I wish rr or kxip were in the playoffs.  Dc does not deserve a spot here with the way they have played lately.,15
Anukul Roy is surely the best substitute fielder of the season.,11
Pant is a living example of what happens to players when they listen to those ‘take a single after hitting a six’ types Indian experts ...they want the same thing for Samson as well . Never listen to these dead ass moronic experts and fck your natural style,35
Pant practicing for test series,4
these cred mofos,5
"If you ever feel useless, remember, in a tournament with no fans, in the middle of a desert, someone is still calculating and displaying the duckworth-lewis score.",13
Mumbai are fielding with 12 players. This Anukul = 2. He's so fast and athletic,9

"As soon as we cross 49, I will switch the channel. Mission will be accomplished.",12
At least act like you wanna win.,3
Imagine pant scoring a 100 and giving DC the win despite the odds,4
Man punjab would have been interesting in playoffs. Dc is just dirt poor.,6
"DC goes tuktuk...Kedar Jadhav & Dhoni, ye hum kar lete hai..aap tab tak...",2
"Now, imagine Prithwi Shaw in Indian Test squad!",3
RCB better not pull off an DC tomorrow. I have high hopes for them,3
r/cricket trying to get Pant to form,9
Lmao RRR of 13. Game over ?,3
"Batsman has a slow start in difficult run chase

Me : Is he doing Tewatia...",14
"Didnt expect both MI's batting and bowling lineup to shit all over DC like this, damn",7
"I remember once Delhi had a similar start chasing against Gujrat Lions and then Chris Morris just went apeshit and was 83 off 32. It was one of the best innings I had watched, he hit Pravin Tambe for 3 consecutive sixes. Delhi did lose by 1 run but man that was some innings",9
Csk's mouth is watering to get him nxt season looking at pant rn,2
How Delhi management thinks between Shaw or Tushar Deshpande... both will get out for 0 runs but one will give away runs so Shaw it is.,6
"2020 is the most odd year i ve seen in my whole life

No points in guessing in who is gonna win this ipl",10
How did DC beat RCB? Or anyone?,14
"Not gonna lie, it was disappointing that DC didn't show intent even against Pollard. A one sided beatdown doesn't do justice to a qualifier.",11
Maybe they're just gonna defend until 49 and THEN unleash.,8
Lol @ this sub shitting on Pant when the top 3 scored a grand total of 0,23
I'm so confused do the people in this thread want pant to slog out and leave everything for the legendary batting trio of sams axar and ashwin?,8
Imagine if DC wins from here!,3
Man y'all keep joking about how SRH's tail starts at 5 but DC only has Dhawan,16
I'd rather you get all out at 60 in 15 overs rather than 100-5 or 6 in 20 and trying to save face while chasing 201.,4
Stoinis should single handedly carry dc and then flex his pecs,2
"With the number of top order collapses this season, we have to give props to 2017 KKR. Getting a team all out for 49 isn't easy.",3
Give ur best shot I don't mind them getting all out for 140  in 15 overs then to make 120 in 20.,5
Shreyas has good hair. That is the only compliment he'll get from me,9
"This isn't Delhi Capitals, this is Delhi Daredevils.",13
Rohit bowling Pollard to make sure DC's score crosses 49. Rift confirmed.,11
Our timeouts are the best. We do more dumb shit after it lol.,13
U/singhsrb u/dillikaladka man does our team suck :'),5
"Honestly T20 is a fickle game and any team can have their day, but after Mumbai Srh looks like the most dangerous team. If only they hadn't thrown a few of their games away and so many injuries.",7
They need to choose one bowler and go apeshit. Krunal is the one.,2
"TBH Rohit's captaincy record looks much better because of the strength of this team rather than his captaincy capabilities. It would take some real shitty captaincy to not be in top 2 of IPL with this team. Strongest squad in the tournament and it's not even close. They will beat you on good and average days. Even on their bad day, you need to play well to beat them.",8
I'm kinda wishing RCB had won that last game now... Maybe they'd have faired better 🤷🏻‍♀️,3
Bonus over,1
[deleted],1
Ian bishop : unfortunately you couldn't hear Murali Karthik speak about the question during the break. Me: UNFORTUNATELY? LIKE REALLY? UNFORTUNATELY?,3
How is fairplay award decided ? Majorly net over rate right ?,1
"From espn:

>""A couple of years ago, we would expect a Pant special 80 off 35 balls in this situation. Today, it is likely to be 20 off 30 balls and then getting out. "" kannan, that is what happens when you don't get rewarded for 80 off 35 but get punished for 15 off 5 when trying to do that

Man I hope Pant does get better,",11
"Dhoni took 12 years to go from Boom boom to tuk tuk.

Pant just has taken 12 months to achieve that lmao",5
This exactly looks like CSK batting.,1
"IPL should enact a law to make MI do some charity by forcing them to donate their NRR to poorer teams (read, KKR).",4
"Atleast Stoinis is trying, no intent from Pant",1
5d chess by kohli to lose to dc so we wouldn't have to face this humilation. Can you imagine the meltdown on this sub alone if rcb played like this?,9
Punjab deserved this playoff spot lmao.,5
I'd like the other commentators to form a gang and beat up Murali Kartik after the IPL is done. Add Deep Dasgupta and KP to it.,3
Love the intensity in the field today. Players were playing like dead fish in the RCB vs DC match and later MI when they were defending the low target vs SRH.,1
MI is all guns blazing in batting bowling and fielding,1
"Take your pick:



Bolwers like Rabada-Nortje who bowls 150 to 155 kph but are not very consistent. 



Bolwers like Bumrah-Boult who bowls 140-145 kph but are consistent as fuck",6
We're trying to maintain BREVITY here.... who hired this Murali for the commentating job.,3
Pls break RCB's record DC.Rohit bring in Boult and Bumrah pls.,3
"People on here defending pant by saying they ruined him etc etc can fuck off. He is not special, every Indian player has people who tell them how they should bat. You SHOULD/MUST know what works the best for you and if you don't, then honestly you won't be surviving much at the international level",13
Delhi playing for NRR now,1
Good defending by van dijk,2
"Stoin is there for the long game, Pant has to go destructive.",1
Pant playing for NRR,3
Showboating now. Pick up and rolling like that.,2
DC fans thought Rahane will be like 23(22) but Stoinis came out of syllabus,4
"What’s the point of defending man? You either smash and win or get folded. 

Ain’t no NRR at play.",1
Dd should just declare after crossing 49,6
Look how they massacred my boy,4
Man DC have given up at this point,2
Geography with Swanny,3
I'm not sure DC have played this right.,2
oh shit i forgot about rahul chahar,2
Mumbai has shown the most intent in fielding this season hands down.,5
"Remember even last year's Qualifier 1 to be a snooze feast. 

CSK in that match showed us the trailer of how they were gonna bat this season.",1
hotstar stuttering a lot on a decent connection. can any of you kind sirs help?,-2
Why they are showing highlight of 78* (28) that is just making me feel more sad :(,7
"Sad to see Pant turn into someone like this. He took his criticizers way too seriously. He was the only person in the current set of Indian players, who resembled Sehwag's style of fearless play.",33
"During childhood when the other team had a few players short, 1 or 2 players from our team would go on to play in opposite team.

MI should loan a cpl of batsmen to DC to make this competitive.",7
Swann flexing all his geography,7
Why would DC fight here? They'll get another chance to go to the finals anyway,4
Lezzzoooooiiii generational talent lmao,2
"There are literally talking about mountain ranges in Dugout.

Definitely more interesting than the match.",23
Rip pant,2
What tf happened to pant man,4
The young team aged along the tournament and playing like oldies and leaving nearly and the old team played like young team at the back end of tournament while leaving,9
So there's no chance Delhi drop Jason Roy right? That means they drop Woakes though and I hope we get him,2
Lmao.. Pant can't even hit spinners now...,8
"Stoinis: ""Look at me. I'm the opener now.""",13
RIP,0
Eeezzzyyy eeezzzyyy wicket,5
48 all out still on the cards,4
Pant goes without even trying to hit it as hard.,2
Amazing batting pant.,2
Pant lmao,0
Game over,2
49 still possible,1
Feels sad for Pant.,9
Even KKR does better than this against MI,11
9 more guys,2
MI takes PANT(s) Down. Time to do it doggy style now.,4

What has happened to Pant💔,9
"Shikhar Dhawan's last 4 innings:

Against MI: 0 (2)

Against RCB: 54 (41)

Against MI: 0 (2)

Against SRH: 0 (1)

Thanks RCB.",15
Pant got out playing this same shot in 2019 WC SF.,6
Aur cake khaa mote,7
It's extremely sad looking at the decline of Pant the hitter! He could have smashed it with eyes closed and feet tied 1 year back.,3
Why Pant not able to clear the boundaries nowadays,0
Next year watch Hetmyer go to MI and become a beast there.,6
very nice,1
"Mi vs Srh will be a  worthy final
DC and RCB both suck",6

Pant answered all those questioning his Test place this season with his s/r,7
Pant is burned down,3
"I am speechless. Was genuinely expecting Pant to show up, extremely disappointed. Knew we didnt have much of a chance but this is just humiliating",8
Never seen anybody more out of form than these Delhi batters lately. It's fucking insane how out of touch some of them are.,9
Bring this man to csk RN,5

SKY is such a cutie,5
F for Delhi. They should just go for it. NRR doesn't matter just build up the momentum for the final from now on,3
"I am Pant fan, but glad he's dropped from Aus tour, he don't deserve to be in test team with this form",1
"Oh wait we lost a wicket from a left arm spinner to a left hander!

That’s a concept unheard of in Delhi!!",6
Rishabh Moti Gaand Pant,6
Fuckkkk Bumrah and Boult still have four overs left between them...Thank God Rohit is out of form or else the team would surpass OP status 😵,3
This doesnt even seem like a fitness issue ... Pant not being able to take down a left arm spinner is just sad,8
RIP DC,3
"LMAO WHAT A GAME

mumbai Maulers",2
It’ll take a lot to get Pant back to playing at his best. Looks completely shot.,6
How did we let this team beat us . Only one explanation is inflate deflate.,6
Now here that generation talent back to dugout,3
"1 shot he goes for, pant gets out",4
"People can all the excuses they and blame everyone but him but the only person to be blamed for his poor performances is Pant. 

Some of the excuses for him are beyond ridiculous.",7
"Who is the guy who hugged SKY after the catch ? 

BTW he is in as a substitute and even Anukul Roy. How many Mumbai players are out rn 😂",6
"Seriously, what happened to Pant? Feels so bad man",3
Pant could do well with the month off till the test series.,2
"New to watching this sport. 
Why are there so many unfit players ? 
By unfit I mean overweight/obese . 
Are there no physical tests to pass ?",2
Oh Pant.... this was your chance for redemption,5
DC is getting massacred. Someone help plij,6
Unpopular opinion: Ambani payed DC for this /s,4
"Rishabh. This is not a sarcastic post, but what happened to your confidence dude!. You used to tonk Bhuvi for fun with your insane shots. Feeling bad man",9
Our Don Bradman up next,4
Come on guys 8 more runs to go. We can do this.,3
Really wish DC got thrashed like this in the group stage so that a more capable team could've taken their place,5
"Now even Anmolpreet is fielding, who is he in for? Ankul lol",4
hogaya match,1
I hate seeing pant like this. I really love watching him bat in full flow.,3
"~~Pant, Samson, Shaw~~

**Kishan**",7
Got out to krunal???,2
Feeling terrible for Shaw and Pant 😢,0
*RCB enters the chat*,2
I am so sad about Pant's intent and loss of spark. He is rapidly moving towards Kambli type downfall.,5
"""This will give a massive NRR boost for MI!"" - Dhoni probably",8
Are you seriously telling me that Pant is the best we can do in the WK-batsmen department?,5
Okay who is our next captain after koach?,-1
Surya taking catch of Pant poetic justice?,3
Damn RCB how you lose to this team,4
"DC's downfall started with that match against KXIP. Dhawan scored a hundred at 170 SR and rest of the team collectively couldn't score any runs or cross an SR of 90. 

Look at their team totals in consequent matches:

135/9 vs KKR (lost by 59 runs)

131 all out vs SRH (lost by 88 runs)

110/9 vs MI (MI won by 9 wickets)

154/4 vs RCB (DC won by 6 wickets)

Absolutely brainfade stuff.",9
Pant has a month or so before tests and should focus on losing all that weight he has put on,3
Pls pant at his best next year,0
Is it worst to go for a duck or to go 3 off 9 out lol,0
Delhi do not deserve another shot to reach the final after this shitshow.,1
Delhi Chokers,0
"Just give every award to MI and end this boring one sided competition here itself 👍

Purple cap

Fair Play

IPL trophy

Super Striker

Cred powerplayer of the tournament


Just do the ceremony and get over with this shitfest of a so called ""exciting"" tournament",-2
Temporary captain,1
"Our test batting looking murky, someone like Pujara and Vihari with ofcourse koach only looking good",-4
SRH cordially thanks MI for resting their bowlers and letting us through. We shall try our best to get to the finals and lose to you there.,10
Rishab still not learned the lesson from world cup semis for pressure games.,2
Axar with 150* now,5
"Kishan>>>>Pant t20

Saha>>>>Pant Test",8

please delhi make a game out of this so i can get paid",4

therefore, RCB = MI

Has anybody tried telling MI it's an even year?,3
"RCB lost to THIS DC!

I hope SRH wins the elinimator, otherwise we will have another super boring DC vs RCB match to decide who gets to be humiliated by MI in the finals!",12
iyer looked like he was about to cry,5
Daniel Sams has 2 List A 50's... just telling,5
I am glad Pant wasn't selected in white ball... Even in tests Saha should be preferred over him.. he needs to go back to domestic and sort his game out..,9
Pant was publicly criticized for playing his natural game and having a few bad games by the coach if I'm not mistaken. This change in approach is a direct result of that.,6
"Seriously IK is twice the batsman Pant is and probably a better keeper as well. Don't throw domestic records in my face just watching these 2 bat I can see how much superior IK is in terms of technique and power hitting. At least in T20, he's my pick",5
I've been an ardent supporter of Shaw but dump his ass for now man. Bring in Lalit/Tushar and make them open. Tushar showed good sign and can be a pinch  hitter. Lalit is also an allrounder(leg break). So do it DC.,3
Pant needs to get dropped surely. He's just a waste of a spot at this point. He's completely out of touch. Some tough decisions need to be taken next game.,1
DC should be rename to duck capitals,3
Kkr were 42-3 after 8 overs n made 190+ against DC,3
[deleted],13
Pretty sure siddharth malhotra in the himalayas plays better than this current team,4
"Saha 58(39) Pant 3(9)

India test vs Aus......

Pant>>>>>>>>>> Saha",6
"Axar talking to Krunal, spiderman meme intensifies",3
"Pant's bat speed seemingly decreased this season.

I reckon this fitness issue is indeed serious and hampering his batting.",3
Kohli realised he couldn't perform no matter how hard he tried without working on his fitness. Pant should learn something from him. Or atleast Kohli should have a little chat with him.,2
Time for Pant fans to blame everyone but pant for getting caught at long on for nth time 😭😂😭😂😭,8
"Axar: Wait why am I opening? I'm a bowler.

*looks at team*

Oh I was picked by DC. Opening it is!",7
These fuckers make Krunal Pandya look like the greatest left arm spinner who ever lived every match lol.,12
"This thread : Pant let's go, hit out or get out.

Pant gets out.

This thread: *Shocked Pikachu face*",27
Pant is playing like 40 year old Dhoni at 23,6
I'd rather watch Arnab Goswami getting arrested in loop than watch Axar patel's batting,7
[deleted],13
"Pant was also dismissed playing the same shot against a left arm spinner in the NZ semi final. Another similarity with that game, besides the already noted similarity with the first four dismissals.

Although this is Pant's most frequent dismissal so no surprises there",7
Serious question- Can any International Team defeat MI? (without players that are involved in MI),9
I want rcb vs dc in the qualifier because choker koach will give us a free win,2
"When Lara says mi 2020 is the best franchise, u gotta admit it",8
A young time alone won't do it. A young team guided by Dravid is the real deal.,5
Damn that was a good question,1
7 runs more guys,1
Meanwhile Koach getting ready for the post match presentation speech tomorrow to blame toss or pitch.,3
"Sad to see what the Indian cricketing fraternity has done to Pant. Yes, he's also responsible for his lack of fitness but the way he was always bashed for his swashbuckling and cavalier style definitely messed with his head.",9
"If Pant fails to perform in Aus, give Ishan Kishan a fair amount of games before the world cup",9
7 to make with 5 wickets in hand,1
Ponting has a lot of pointing to do now,1
Where is SAMS?,1
Is this the same team who beat RCB in a decently comprehensive manner?,8
Shaw played better than Pant because he cost less balls being shit!,8
Pant needs to take a break from cricket for six months and come back fresh and fit,2
Scenes if DC gets all out for 48😂😂,1
Would love to see a WI /England vs MI match,2
Does anybody have any idea where I can watch  RCB's 49 runs  match?,3
Lean patch is a concept foreign to this sub apparently,5
6 runs to go,2
"Pant is like dhoni .......dhoni of 2020

Not like dhoni of 2006",8
Actual 48 on the cards.,2

TKR finished unbeaten????? No team could ever do that in the ipl,10

The reigning T20I champions can easily beat MI for sure,2

Just tuned in and wondering how did this happen.... bad batting or good bowling? Or a bit of both,0
MI should play against best IPL XI out of all other teams. Then there might be a chance of even contest.,3
"Man i miss the days of being mad at 9(3) Pant. Atleast i knew next match he'll score 60(28)

This 3(9) version is just sad",17

INTENT,2
Forget 49 lets target 69  xDD,2
Bye bye 49 memes,4
No way we are better than England or Australia or India (if we (India) actually select our team well),1
"I hope both Pant and Shaw are made to sit out of the Australia Tests for their own good. They will get humiliated so bad. It could be an embarrassment as bad as Rahul 2018. Let's be honest, there's no way they are turning shit around with this kinda confidence. The two are a complete mess rn.",5

85(35) for axar and 90(40) for stoinis.. come on guys put up a fight,4
"It will be interesting to see if DC decides to retain Pant, with his current form, in the next mega auction!",1
Thanks to Swanny for shuting down stupid question of MI being best T20 team in world better than International T20 team,5
Might as well enjoy some stoinis.,5
Is it me or does Stoinis’ chest become bigger with every boundary,6
"Pant is a very talented guy but he's going through a rough patch of days it's not easy to score 150 against a quality attack in aus and eng, I hope he makes a comeback",6

Stoinis boinis the only one playing. Everyone else is existing.,2
Sad RCB noises,0
May be Pant should see a therapist. Someone or something has deeply f'ked with his mind,5
Those Dhoni comparisons finally make sense now,1
Dugout commentators drilling Shaw's ass lmao,1
I like how the commentators are speaking as if DC still had a chance lol.,4
The All Star game should be MI vs best XI combined from 7 other teams,5

Stoinis to open with Dhawan.

Shaw and emerging player DO NOT go together,17
"This is kinda reminding me of my brother's school cricket games... We'd always hope his team batted first so that it could be over quickly.

This game is like those days when we'd have to spend the whole day there while the other team scored a ton of runs only for his team to collapse within like a half an hour anyway as per usual.",11
[removed],5
Stoinis still have a grudge against RCB. Single handedly got us over 49.,7
Lmao Parth Jindal waving the flag like a clown. This team has let him down massively. Can't fault him.,2
Yet another heartbreak for RCB fans,2
Stoinis to recreate that innings from that NZ ODI?,4
" Cricketers are criticised all the time, it's how you react to it that showcases if you have the fortitude to make it in international cricket.

MSK Prasad, then the chief Indian selector, told Samson he needs to change his game and become more consistent to be selected in the Indian team. Samson said he's not willing to change his style for consistency. Samson backed himself and MSK Prasad ended up selecting him for the T20i squad.

This is not to say Samson is better. Rather that Samson had belief in his game, whereas Pant heeded to outside noise.",14
Damm Delhi batting line up is huge..,1
As a Delhi fan its natural for us to find the best in the worst situation- So 2 boundaries and rest singles every over and this can get close,3
Man this is just plain torture to watch Pant playing like this :((((((,3
want to see stoinis go ballistic,2
Bring Bumrah and get the Stoinis,2

Inb4 Stoinis 119(56),7
DC better not beat SRH/RCB. Otherwise MI will just get a free championship win.,3
Fuck man we need that Stoinis wicket,1
Feel really bad about Pant. This is exactly why sometimes you gotta trust your own guts and not bow down to opinionated advice.,7
If only people here criticized pant as much as gill/shaw,9
What’s with the one-sided matches for a week now,3
"Pant should take a break and work on his fitness and play a bit of domestic cricket to regain his lost form and confidence

Stoinis plays every Delhi match like that 146 game,3
Stoinis what a hero,1
Stoinis resisting like he is leonidas.,2
6 #700 for this year!!,1
wtf are these things this guy stoinis is hitting and why isn't he going back to the pavillion,3
Stoinis 150(69) incoming,7
Stoinis is triggered,4
Imagine stoinis clutching this,5
Ffs don't try to jinx him now 😑😑,5
Damn. Got hulk angry now you lot,3
Good sign for Deli if Stoinis can use this innings to regain form for their next match vs winner of RCB/Sunrisers,5
Stoinis is love.,1
"The only way i see this going is stoinis powering up ,his biceps becoming big enough to rip his jersey , him screaming "" this one's for you zampa"" and hitting the winning runs",7
"Braindead Delhi management, I say to you for the last time: Stoinis is your missing opener.

And you deserve to be fucked if you don’t figure that out all tournament when I had that set before the tournament.",0
"*49 achieved I repeat 49 achieved. Mission accomplished, over.*

Ricky-okay that’s enough for now abandon your posts, over.",7
Stoinis going for the NRR!,4
How many people turning gay if Stoinis chases this down?,10
"Poor Pant. 



Madlad used to be the kind of guy who cunt any team for a 74(35) any day. 



They told him to bat ""sensibly"" and be a boring 50(43) kind of guy



Now he is neither a 74(35) kind of guy nor a 50(43) kind of guy. 



The only thing that is still with him is his age. Hopefully he will be okay. And for FFS every goddamn ""Expert"" should stop bringing up Dhoni whenever this kid's name gets mentioned. Forget about him, he is gone. You ""experts"" have done enough to ruin this guy, now just STFU.",21
good on you for not going for the kill and not ending the game too quickly,3
Feels bad to see Pant playing like this.,4
Stoinis 146 repeat?,5
[deleted],9
"DC fans, I would advise you join me in rooting for SRH instead. They can beat MI",6
Deshpande would have carried Delhi to victory here,7
Stoinis king slayer mode is on i guess,2
Lads want stoinis to go ballistic then complain when he gets out 🤦‍♂️,4
"MI, you can win the finals just let us win this game. We just wanna reach the finals once",7
"Fuck me, our boys in blue will run into Warner, finch, Stoinis, Smith, Maxi, Starc, zampa, Cummins in 3 weeks. They gonna get smacked around!",20
Somewhere else zampa: I raised that boy,17
The only way DC can win is if Ricky ponting says to Stoinis that they will buy Zampa in next auction if he hits 150 today,14
Ponting told stoinis in the timeout he could have a day off with zampa if he wins,23
If DC doesn't open with stoinis next game they deserve to lose,6
"If stoin pulls this off, no other IPL performance comes close",13
Does Stoinis think he's playing against RCB? 😂,4
What a fuckin massacre! But Honestly Mumbai Indians is the only team where the 2 star batsmen can score ducks and then also win the match comfortably! What is even Rohit Sharma’s role in Mumbai Indians?,15
"Play the Indian leg spinner or Harshal, drop Sams and Shaw, get Stoinis to open with Dhawan, get Hetmayer in. And then pray to SuperMan^^TM that we don't embarrass ourselves so badly.",9
"We all agree that Pant is an insane talent who’s lost his way. 

But the hype around Shaw seems to be based on the fact that he’s a diminutive batsman from Mumbai who has MRF as his bat sponsor.",28
Axar has to switch to Gayle mode,6
Indian cricket having great depth and vast number of future greats is such a myth.,7
Time to get Bumrah back into the attack.,2
Its already 10 overs 😂😂😂 dc fans why are you still watching LOL,1
Who is that sub fielder,1
Australians looking at ipl: why can't you do that for us!,7
"There is something  that many players like Rahul, QDK, Stoinis can't perform under Kohli but play well after they are released. Is it team environment,  attitude of captain,  pressure , lot of ben stokes. 

And then he keeps backing Lord Siraj and such.

He is so lucky that he got amazing India XI so that his captain records look good.",14
And to think only 2 of the MI players were selected for Australia tour.,5
Stoin 100 tonight ?,2
Ankul Roy the fielder is everyhere,6
"This batting effort by DC clearly shows us how horrendous RCB batted to get all out for 49.

And it was not like they got out to Bumrah and Boult",15
"Rohit must be giving the ball to other bowlers just to let them practice, right?",3
"Ganguly sitting there thinking :"" Behenchod yeh kaisa script hai """,7
Stonis showing why he has the highest individual score in BBL,5
Saurav don't embarrass us wearing your mask like that. Take it off.,10

**happy ashwin noices**,0
"Other players play bad: Fans criticize the player

Pant plays bad: Fans criticize everyone else but Pant",10
Is DC playing for NRR now?,6
"England T20 Batting is equal to MI for sure (Roy, Bairstow,Malan,Morgan,Butler,Stokes and Moen). Coming to bowling they have Archer, Wood, Jordan, Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali. Can they match Bumrah, Boult, Coulternile, Krunal, Chahar?",4
"You know what would be hilarious? DC losing all 3 games against MI, only to turn up and beat them in the final.",6

"Hot Take- Open with Stoinis, Shaw cant face swing send him at 6, he will have a decent chance then atleast.",8

it's now ""what is the lowest number of runs DC can lose by""",14
How is Krunal giving only 4 runs off the over bad? Some of you are ridiculous,10
Who wouldn't want a one-man show Stoinis innings now,8
"Do People have confidence that Pant has the fitness to last 2-3 days in Australian heat and keep his performances up behind the stumps?

Australia is the worst place to drop catches . That's my biggest worry at the moment. 

Not whether he has intent or not. But is his fitness good enough",9

Jokes on you lads, we ain’t winning shit!",20
This is chasable if they had wickets,5
Someone tonk Pollard for the love of God,5
Thr fucking downvoter is back,12
Shaw is LOI Sehwag but scores ducks instead of the 10s-20s for 7-8 innings before one great one.,8
Lol I thought Stoinis would lose his shit after that Krunal interaction and get out but I remembered he’s not Pant,3
Man I hope RCB win. Delhi can't play Rashid Khan at all,2

Shaw in the emerging players contention,7
Fuck the downvoting bots. I am upvoting every parent comment.,6
I just don't understand why RR and KKR fans are shitting on DC and RCB here? Why they don't just accept that they played well but not just well enough? Stop crying ffs.,11
"Pant is definitely struggling but some of the slander he gets feels too much, the man scored hundred in England and Australia in tests ffs, something even Dhoni failed to do and he's still 23.",10
"Why is everyone getting downvoted..

This isnt a CSK game guys..",13

This match will again ignite the DC team and we'll win the Q2 only to put out a deflating performance in the finals again.,8
imagine playing so bad that a bowling allrounder (axar) has made more than your top 3 combined,10
FairPlay Award confirmed,8
Isn't Pollard stepping on the Danger zone (whatever that center bowling line is called),7
Anyone know why the striker end umpire is never on the off side?,6
If the dew comes from the clouds I'd walk backwards to Kashi,3

"This match is turning into a Xerox copy of KKR v RR, their last match.",7
"Honestly, at this point it looks like we(SRH) are with the best shot to take on MI. We are already riding on a huge wave of momentum and if somehow make it to the final, I have faith in Warner and Williamson garu to pull it off.

Other teams are in a state of depression.",13

Chennai topping fair play award? Lick my ass Dhoni.,12
Saha doing better than pant in the IPL is hilarious,13
Ngl if mumbai was in same situation in the end somehow they would've managed to win it,5
And FairPlay Award goes to the fanboys who start downvoting when their teams start losing TAALIYAN,2
dont think pant would play LOIs for 1-2 years or so with kl and samson in the team. dont think he'll play tests either if he flops this bad in aus.,4
"So Prithvi is in , SKY is not.

What were these selectors smoking?

Smell some politics against MI players.",6
Axar looking dead inside after wide not given lol,4
An plausible theory: The laziness of Pollard while bowling makes the batsmen lazy as well and they don't feel like hitting him.,11

Iyer’s strategy can be summarised by his dismissal today. Team is 3 down for fuck all and we are attacking Bumrah. Yeah that was going to work!,14
It really tells u how shit dc is playing when pollard has been the most economical bowler this innings,5
"Pollard looks like a bowler who doesn't want to bowl but is under legal contract to do it..

Kinda like Daniel Craig playing James Bond..",13
"It's gonna be MI vs SRH in the finals, isn't it?",7

Why half of the MI players are so unlikable.,14

"Every time Krunal doesn't release the ball, he be like *I had you in the first half, don't lie*",7

How is it when Kohli does it it's agressive cricket and when krunal does it he's a cunt and has a punchable face.,8
Wtf krunal,5
Stoinis scored as quickly as SKY!,8
Sneaky bowling change by Rohit by making Pollard bowl 2 overs just in case a bowler starts getting smacked later,7
Pant needs to develop his offside game. Bowlers have started to figure him out and he will be done if he doesn't adapt his game. The bad form isn't helping either.,5
Lmao Krunal getting all that hate because of that punchable face 💀💀,19
We'll have a bowl first,11
Bouncer from Krunal lol,5
So are we still supposed to believe that Krunal is a spinner,7

"Hahaha, Krunal Pandya is a jack~~shit~~ of all trades",3
"I don't understand.  Unless Pant had some Mental health issues or something else, there's absolutely no reason he should be this unfit. He's paid 15 fucking crores to play for Delhi. The least he could do is stay fit?. Forget Delhi he plays for the national side. He could hire a personal trainer, a personal dietitian,  a personal chef and have the best equipments and then STILL save a lot of money lol. There's no excuse for this kind of fitness.

I'm a student and I've had weight issues myself. I actually lost 15 kgs during the whole stay at home period and keep continuing to do so.",16
Krunal you piece of shit,-3
krunal is a medium pacer who just comes with a spin action,5
Anyone remember Miller - Axar 100 runs partnership in punjab. I am getting that vibe here. Can someone share that match stat?,5
Krunal's face is the most punchable face ever,6
DC playing for NRR even in playoffs. Big brain move,10
Krunal is a spinner with the intent of a fast bowler who can bowl 150+,8
"Stonis Delhi's best batsman and 2nd best bowler.

At least Shane Warne can get a good wank today.",5
So you're telling me Krunal is a spinner?,11

Krunal bowls like a 50 year old flexing his skills on the neighbourhood teenagers,12
Krunal is really messing it up.... doesn’t suit him... a player like hardik taking on another international player makes sense. Krunal has rarely played for India... shitty guy,9
Poor Chahar,2

"stoin be like: *sniff *sniff HMM its chahar, smash! must smash HUNGHHAHAAAHHHHHHH",4
Wtf poor Chahar,0
[deleted],3
"We all know this is not going anywhere, we have lost this. Even if there is a situation where we need to score 1 run in an over, I'll still say that we'll lose. Expect nothing, be surprised when we win.",1
DC can still do this,2
I can clearly see why Zampa and Warne got such a man crush on Marcus.,3
send bowlers to face the new ball against boult and bumrah,4
What is this pie fielding!!,1
Inb4 Stoin 146*(69),2
I wish Jason Roy parachutes onto the pitch in a Delhi Daredevil kit.,3
"Why's he gone round the wicket? Bowling at leg stump too, very negative, he's not going to lose the game, might as well attack.",0
We’re being too complacent,4
Hope stoinis gets a 100 today,4
TONDU Bois playing so bad today.,2
MI so confident that they’re not bringing Boult/Bumrah back in yet to get the job done. Giving bowlers extra practice I guess?,2
Lenskart ft. Pollard part 2,3
The MI fielders feeling sorry for Delhi today,1
Hope Pollard gets this sloppy in the finals too.,4
"Straight up fact: you all don't like Krunal because he looks a certain way. If any other player bowled like he does, he'd be the second coming of Christ. If Koach or someone this sub loves behaved like Krunal did, you guys would be down on your knees ready to suck. But that's OK.",9
Lol lenskart just got fresh footage,6
How is the batting team 86/5 and on the ropes but one bowler in the opposition has gone for 34 in 1.4? Just baffles me,7
Pollard got intimidated by God Anukul roy.,2
Abey Polly kaka,4
Only reason to continue watching the match is Big Stoin cunting bowlers around.,8
Why does pollard have to do that ? Needs to be fit now,4
Stoinis one man army right now.,9
MI tryna make this match interesting,2
Unnecessary dive from pollard,3
Someone explain to me why Stoinis is not an opener. Man is sticky af,4
Wtf are we in doing? Were taking it too lightly at this point,2
Pollard possessed by Neymar suddenly.,5
Delhi playing for nrr. I don’t understand?!?!,4
"These overs mean shit when you follow it up with a 3 run over, make that a 10-12 run over atleast to have a chance",4
"I honestly hate Krunal and Chahar, they've the shittiest faces in MI. Nice to see Stoinis smashing them",-3
Kieron Pollard credit card declined fielding...,8
Bat stoinis at 3,2
Marcus Stoinis Highest T20 score is 147 !!,2
Almost everyone here would get inner peace if Stoinis was doing this to Krunal instead of Chahar.,19
Stoinis here is giving me heavy flashbacks of Faulkner's 100 after Rohit's first 200,19
Stoinis score a century,1
Indian van djik getting whacked today,4
This game is not over until Stoinis is out,7
If DC wins from here I'll cut my privileges,2
Has there every been 5 ducks before in a T20 game?,5
"Stoinis saving face, get a 100 please big man",2
"""Everyone except Chahar bowled well today""",6
MI: Let's try to get them a little closer. Don't worry we will clean up with Burmah and boult later.,1
Does anyone remember 10+ years back MI got Pollard in a special mid year auction I think. There was a secret tie breaker when max amount was reached. 1 m $ was max amount then I think.,7
Bruh wtf Imagine Stoinis scoring a 💯,3
So our batting starts at 5 down,4
Lmao even if DC beats SRH or RCB...they have to meet this MI again in Final lol,9
"110 in 7, I've seen stranger things happen this season",9
Big stoin carrying delhi.,3
"If our batsman were remotely competent, this would have been a good game.",2
It's a miracle Pollard doesn't get broken by his own weight when he dives.,1
Lmao just bowl Pollard instead of Chahar,5
"If you are bowling with 17.5 eco rate against DC, imagine what the likes of Warner and Saha are going to do",3
Chad Brian Lara,3
"I think that if Pant does ever play of MI in next 2-3 years, it will be great for him and Indian Cricket in general. Right now he isn't clear of his role is in DC or Indian team. Both haven't managed him properly.",5
"MI trying to ensure #Quantumofloss is low for Delhi so that DI go into their eliminator with confidence and reach the final for them to tonk again.

69d chess",11
Yeah man. Make it interesting. We don't need a boring match.,5
Scoring 160+ will boost the DC's morale!,2
[deleted],3
teams need to play away that first boult over. At this point as an indian its getting really frustrating.ffs everytime,4
Would love for Stoinis to pick up a 100,4
[deleted],-4
"If this match finally convinces these fucks to open for Stoinis, I am all for it.",7
that pollard dive going to launch another investigation into match fixing?,6
Axar is batting like a top oder batter,6
We need wicket,0
Ffs just bring boult or bumrah.,1
Chahar is going home after that over,1
Game on?,0
WHAT A SHOT,5
Masterclass by DC so they can get 1 extra match for Rabada to win Purple Cap,2
"What is Axar doing? No point in preserving wickets, NRR doesnt matter",1
"I will not raise my hope, but if we chase this down, stoinis shall never leave the club",5
Bruh bring on boult bumrah,1
Stoinis is doing a Jadeja. This is just semi final all over.,4
[removed],6
Textbook,2
In b4 Delhi wins this and stoinis scores 150,5
Discount Jadeja going good,-1
Stoin can take on Boult. Boult isn't as effective with the old ball.,6
"Next opening pair for Delhi, lets play them",1
"Delhi know Stoinis is better as an opener, good decision to let him do so today

Not sure losing 4 wickets in 3 overs was the way to do it however",4
So basically any team with India in the name can't take wickets after the fifth one?,8
We’re leaking runs man,3
Where did that come from?,2
Why aren't they bowling Pollard?,5
"Stoinis: Guys I'm not going to an angry Ponting rn, will wait till 20th over",5
Csk will be looking at 110 required off 42 and thinking that DC have played this perfectly,3
"Nathan ""16 economy"" Coulter-Nile",1
"Even if count out Bumrah 2 overs for 10 runs, 90 runs in 5 overs pretty plausible with dew",4
Imagine buying a Great top order batsman (Stoinis) and playing him at 7,9
r/Cricket tonight: Axar and Stoinis for openers next game.,9
NCN probably playing last game or two for MI. I don't think they will retain him.,1
"Even if Delhi manages to get this close, two overs of Bumrah unfortunately remain...",9
DC would have won this if they weren’t 0-3.. rr is not an issue,3
Mclenaghan wasn't even given one match. NCN gonna be a liability.,3
"Lara makes Cork his bunny in the dugout.

Feels like watching Windies - England test cricket from the 90s.",2
Handy batsman? Bruh that's a proper beautiful cricket shot. Would have made kohli proud.,4
NCN is just shit and from the looks of it he doesn't give a shit.,-3
Guys MI scored 92(30) in last 5 can the same be repeated?🙄🙄,9
If these two somehow pull this of. This would be the greatest partnership in IPL history,11
This is still within reach for Delhi. MI is too relaxed,2
Holy shit MI was only 9 runs ahead for the loss of 4 wickets at this stage. DC is still in this.,5
Betting companies hate Brian Lara,4
Cameraman shows red top chick😲,2
Time for ponting to snatch back those dressing room man of the match thingies.,1
Should just treat Bumrah and Boult like McGrath and Akram against Mumbai and treat other bowlers like some useless U-16s.,5
"Krunal Pandya won't remain at MI at the next mega auction. Pretty sure some other team will break the bank for him, and MI won't even care if he goes.",7
They took Coulter-Nile in the team because of his slight edge in batting. It allows them to go gung-ho from the start.,2
"Bumrah and Boult have overs, they aren't winning this but I hope stoinis gets a century",5
How come this rich assholes don't wear mask properly,9
"DC's ideal XI: 

Dhawan, Stoinis, Stoinis (c), Stoinis, Stoinis, Stoinis, Stoinis (wk), Stoinis, Stoinis, Rabada, Nokia",29
So rest of the overs are NCN + Boult + Bumrah right?,3
"LMAO to all MI supporters saying this game ain't over. This match was long over, sealed after Pant dismissal. Stoinis just delaying the inevitable.",14
MI's 3rd pacer is their only weakness right now,1
Wonder why MI did not try Mitch this year. NCN was pretty meh this year,5
dc would’ve had a proper chance if it weren’t for the asswipe top order,0
Rcb should bring back Aus skipper into the XI. Big match and you need big player.,6
"hear me, hear me, DC really really needs to drop Shaw for the next match!!! he doe snot show intent to defend atleast a over when he a lean patch, throws bat at everything, they should let rahane and dhawan open innings and find some one in middleorder... his fielding is not on par the standards too... please stop gving free wickets to opposition strike bowlers!",5
"Downvoter please come back, you were lucky for DC.",7
I am happy that atleast some of our Batsmen are trying and making it still look like a chase. Otherwise this was straight headed for a humiliation,8
 Scenes if kl rahul doent win the orange cap.,8
Tf is with indian middle order batsmen in ipl when chasing this season??? Always trying to slow the innings down its so annoying,4
Please give Rahul Chahar one more over to redeem himself,5
They will not go back to Pattinson. Coulter-Nile provides more balance to the team. Even Chahar is just having a bad day.,3
Ishan Kishan is on 4th place in Orange cap list Lmao,3
Boulto gone out. Yikes if he is not coming back.,4
I would have still gave them a chance if there wasn't Bumrah in MI lineup,9
If Boult and Kishan are out for the finals...MI will be in big trouble.,8
Mumbai managed a tie against RCB from similar position.,8
[deleted],5
Bruh if boult dont bowl we done,9
"Impossible to pull off this chase, that too with 4 overs of Bumrah and Boult left",6
"Why is everyone asking Pollard to bowl? He didn't bowl well, he just bowled slow and no one intended to even hit him",8
Trump losing... MI winning... Best day ever,7
"Ishan Kishan >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Pant. Going gets tough, pant is no where around. Kishan came around in a critical match and has been very consistent this season.",10
I expected nothing with DC and I'm still disappointed,10
We need bumrah in next over,3
MI do not wanna piss off sponsors by finishing the game before the 2nd strategic timeout.,6
Coulter Nile went for 6 runs in that over.,4
Why don't MI play McClenaghan instead of NCN?,3
What's weird is that if they play stoinis up the order then he has to face Boult and Bumrah and you wanna save your best but then if you save him with this team then it will most probably be too late..,9
Shaw is doing bad cuz he's too high on cough drops,11
I hope Boult recovers from the groin injury before final.,8
"No Boult now right?
Fuck",4
Another over from Pollard with 3.5 runs coming,5
We haven't won yet please don't be overconfident,5
Cork's love for Surya is only matched by his saltiness towards Ashwin,5
"Axar, kab kholega re tera khoon?

T: Axar, when would you start hitting?",2
"With Boult being off Stoin should sense that there is still a miniscule chance left, has to try his level best to chase it down otherwise this already great innings gonna go in vain",7
Did Anukul Roy ever got to play in a match?,2
This is dragging on long enough. MI should bring in Boult and Bumrah and finish the match.,4
Almost 100 reqd of 6.  Bah gawd! It's Raina with the steel chair!,9
only MI could choke it from here,0
Only thing I respect now about Rahane is that he doesn't waste reviews. He knows he is shit.,1
Mi were just 7 runs ahead at this point with 4 wickets lost.,6
It looks like stoinis will carry dc over the line,3
Get chahar out,2
Bowl Pollard and Coulter-Nile for the next 2. The Boult-Bumrah will have to finish it off.,3
No Harsha. Bowling out Bumrah now is stupid,5
"Switched to Hindi comm just to check

*Usual sher shayaris noises*

Biggest mistake of my life",9
If only DC played Hetmeyer,7
Can u hit Polly atleast,1
4-D chess by Rohit: Give DC enough confidence to beat SRH/RCB then bowl out Bumrah and Boult in the first 10 overs of the final. And then finally 2 match extended rape complete.,4
Shaw will get to enjoy Australian summer as a tourist. I am kinda jealous,5
They need to attack pollard here.............,5
Mumbai at this time 108/4,5
So the pitch really looks good for batting. It's just that DC's top order fucked up.,8
"I'm telling everyone from the start mumbai is gonna trash everyone except the finals now with two injuries it looks certain 

Mumbai 2021 boys",3
"Why are they reducing the quantam of loss for the nrr.

Gotta go for it.",2
"I just saw kohli's all time t20 being displayed he's good, great but this just next level ass licking he has been in bad form and his all time doesn't display his current stop it man it's cringy",3
What does our boy Anukul Roy do to get a match? Get emotional in a Netflix documentary?,5
Axar klaxon,2
Finally Axar showing Pollard the right way...,4
As mi fan i am scared now,6
Mumbai were only 6 runs ahead,10
Pollard is the laziest smart bowler,5
Axar is the rockstar that Jadeja pretends to be.,1
Why they hell they are asking people to bring JVC look alike to home.,5
I’m actually worried now,5
"104 off 6 overs, 2 overs of Bumrah. Need 22 from Every over from here on. NRR won't matter so DC have to go biggie big here on , No use taking it deep",3
"I'd be okay with stoinis hitting our bowlers, but axar? Cmon guys show some intent",6
Why does everyone hate Krunal. Its like i missed out or something. What did he do,7
scenes when axar is ur 2nd best bat,4
I swear our genuine Batsmen can learn so much from our All Rounders and Bowlers on how to bat.,10
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
"Good shot Axar, didn't connected well. Still enough",3
Lmao at that poll,2
"""That's a huge six""

Ball falls 2 inches outside the boundary",9
Sponsors asked MI to make this a close match tinfoil hat ready. /s,8
"Will Pollard become the Koach of 2012 ?

If you know, you know ;)",9
Can anyone explain to me why so many on this sub hate Sanjay Bangar from Select Dugout?,3
MI were 110/4 yes but they had Hardik left. Who do DC have? Ashwin?,4
Breaking News: I'm entertaining the idea of DC getting these runs now.,3
Just a reminder that Boult is out with a groin strain. So as of now bumrah's 2 overs are the only ones to fear,2
Lol.. please bangar.. Pollard has no strength in bowling.. he just bowls SLOW...,-1
"If only we had one more wicket in hand, or 2018 Pant. Damn.",8
Delhi bottled the death bowling too hard and now they're at the same position.  MI won't bottle theirs,1
Is the dew coming into play?,2
Axar plz win this for DC,3
Just bowl bumrah-boult omg its past shaws bedtime,3
How good is axar batting rn,2
It must worry Ponting majorly that Axar looks more comfortable with the bat than Shaw these days.,7
Ohhh this one is even better. Such a clean hit. Well-done Axar,2
Bumrah ko jaldi lao varna match palat jayega 😂,2
20 from this over and they're back in the game.,4
"Other team followers are like yes this is over for DC
but us MI fans know.....we know.....",6
Damn. Are we gonna choke now? Lol,4
Scenes if DC win this from here,9
"Axar, what the fuck!",1
Axar is constantly failing to connect with balls dropped slightly short. Stupid of Pollard to pitch it up.,2
Now I am scared,2
Around 90 in 5 overs. Gettable?,3
Rohit with brain dead captaincy here,2
Fuck man I’m tensed now,1
"Axar has been a better batsman for DC than rahane, shaw, Iyer and pant combined lmao",10
R Jadeja feels proud,2
No Boult. dC might actually win this.,-4
Stoinis was brilliant as an opener in BBL maybe DC can open with him the next game cause Shaw and Rahane aren't in the best of form.,8
You have my attention,9
Can Delhi do a twatia?,6
MI mfs helping Axar get back in his batting form,5
"Axar ""Tewatia"" Patel trying to see DC home today",5
It’s soo fucking satisfying seeing pollard get whacked for some reason!!!,9
What a shot !!!!!,3
how is axar playing better than pant and iyer,4
Bruh stop bowling pollard,2
Bro I know we're gonna lose but it's still very entertaining,6
Axar is probably the most underrated player in the IPL,7
"Hahaha fuck off Pollard, your fluke bowling is getting punished",11
"Axar have my babies

I know we can't biologically but, we'll adopt one",2
Why is Ashwin not padded up?,3
DC crowd overreacting like Krunal,9
[deleted],5
Axar has legit hit it better than Pant this season.,4
Y'all forgetting Bumrah and Boult both have 2 overs left lul,3
"Downvoter come back and stay, please. You are DC's lucky charm.",6
Anyone genuinely expecting Delhi to somehow win this chase is requested to apply for modship at Bernie2020 sub.,2
"Jadeja is a wannabe Axar xD

/s",5
Should've gone for the kill. This is getting uncomfortable,5
This is good. Very very late but at least these two can take this confidence in next match.,10
4 overs from Bumrah and Boult left.,8
Axar> top 4,9
"boult injured, and stoinis set, there is still some hope",4
"Shouldnt the Dugout be even slower than the English commentary, considering the latter is watching the game live?",2
FFS now I am starting to get worried. Get a wicket,6
Bumrah or bust,3
Same situation guyzzzz,2
That purple cap on the bowling charts looks like someone made it on MS Paint,6
Rohit's  beard ain’t hiding his double-chin,1
Is Boult injured???,1
Only if we didn't concede 94 off the last 5. We might've had a chance. Even a sliver.,9
"dun dun dun, imagine big stoin and budget jadeja do to bumrah what mi batman did to nokia and KG",2
Is Boult injured?,2
Why did we let Tewatia go dammit.,3
Bumrah's gonna kill the match next over..,6
Get Bumrah back in and stop messing around,6
"Boult won't bowl his remaining 2 overs due to groin injury and is off field currently. Pollard will have to bowl full quota considering chahar's off-day

If only DC kept wickets in hands to capitalize on those. Smh",8
"Now people would tease us about being Daredevils again, myself included but there has been a change. We have come to shit situations more often then not, but unlike those dark days, we dont give up and succumb but actually show some fight. I am genuinely happy with that",5
only hope for dc is if lord tewatia didnt get salty frm ponting and blessed his powers to axar,5
People saying this is getable are also forgetting Bumrah and Boult have 2 overs left each of remaining 5 overs.,5
"Even with Boult out, I can't see Dehli winning this. Required run rate is over 17 lmao",4
Boult is done isn’t he?,1
MI were 122/4 at this stage.,1
Great opportunity for Axar to showcase his batting prowess and prove he is much more than a spinner who can bat a bit.,6
Bumrah is gonna end the match when he comes back.,4
Dominic Cork tries a little too hard. I want him gone from Dugout,2
My butt is slightly clenched right now😅👍🏽,1
Dew for sure is troubling the bowling team...,4
Gg stoinis and axar for atleast trying unlike that cough syrup crackhead,6
Look like Boult is injured,1
"Boult won't be bowling again today. Used all his powers in the first 2 overs. 

Hope he will be fit for the final :(",5
Dugout needs better viewing angles. They don't know fielding placements from the studio.,4
Rahul needs to Bowl 1over 4from NCN and bumrah,1
"Even if Boult and Bumrah start bowling like Dinda and Unadkat, 90 runs from 5 overs is a bridge too far for Delhi.",3
MI fans: *Inner RCB choker intensifies*,2
MI needs 1 over someone if boult is not coming back,2
[deleted],2
How serious is Boult's injury!?,1
If only they had tewatia to come.,2
Bowl out Chahar make it interesting,6
Bumrah has his overs left though. Let's see how that goes.,3
Inb4 Bumrah goes for 15 this over,5
Why is Pant rated so highly?,5
Boult is injured?,6
15 off every over from here and MI win by 13 runs. Not to Forget 2 Bumrah Overs and maybe one Krunal over with deadly bouncers,3
"Lmao, nortje and Rabada lost us this match basically. Happens so rarely",3
We need one Tewetia over. Come on Axar. Time for you to become a lord and pull of the same story.,6
"Hot take: Mumbai bowlers aren't that great apart from Bumrah and Boult, and it might not be a bad idea to either play them out or counter attack them. Nothing in between.",7
Wasn't watching earlier. What happened to Boult?,2
"MI having bowling issues. Boult seems injured, Chahar expensive. If DC had wickets, they could've easily won. Even now, I'd say they have a chance.",3
"At most they gonna get 60 from 5 overs, with Bumrah & Boult bowling.",4
Haha.,2
Well that'll do it,6
What a fucking ball damn.,2
0-3 almost like a football match 😂,3
There you Go,4
What a jaffa,1

Good to see Bumrah in full flow before the Australia series.,3
Literally envisaged Bumrah clean bowling Stoinis and then it happens. Could just tell it was coming.,4
That was an absolute jaffa...,5
It's okay STOIN. You did very well. Very very well. You don't deserve that top order. Go well mate,12
lol stoinis looks like he's about to give a transfer request,13
Bumrah is something else,5

Ambani should just donate 50 crores to Bumrah after he retires or give him 1 floor of Antila,13
Bumrah deserves MoM today.,7
Aaaaaaand Bumrah delivers.,5

"This IPL, Samson showed he has the superior glove work and technique among the current WK contestants. Pant's wicket keeping skills are below average and prone to make mistakes often.


Samson scored 3 50's and 375 runs with a strike rate of 159. He has Rohit Sharma level range of shots and timing when he is on song. He excelled better than Pant in every aspect this season. Ishan scored more runs and he can be considered purely as a batsman.

 I can't seriously believe it when people say when Pant is above pecking order than Samson for his talent. How much more hypocritical can guys get? Talent wise Samson is way above Pant. I don't even understand why the heck every one calls Pant a generational talent? He has a very limited range of shots and his offside game is weak. 

It's also seems that the opponents are already figured him out. Pant is asked to be responsible for his run of low scoring innings repeatedly.Generational talents don't keep making the same mistakes, they adapt and improve.  Pant doesn't adapt nor improve and that's not the fault of coaches of management. It's his own fault. He lacks cricketing intelligence.",6

"Simon Doull: "" IPL is best league why would you not play in it are you mad?""

What happened to Boult why is he not bowling ?,3
Good guy Bumrah sharing wickets and not keeping everything for himself.,9
Can’t even get a 5-fer. Noob,4
"I've been workshopping some jokes for my next stand up set, can you guys let me know if this joke is good? It goes like this: 

Daniel Sams

That's it...that's the joke",14
I am pretty sure Pant might stay as a second choice keeper in upcoming tests unless Saha gets injured or we lose few matches very badly.,3
"I am done with Today, if SRH win tomorrow might as well be on the next flight back",5
I think someone showed yesterday's Sandeep Sharma = Bumrah post to our boy and he very very angry. Result 4/14.,15
Why don't teams shake hands and move on. Target is mathematically impossible now. Or do DC want to injure one of their bowlers,-2
"People discussing auction strategy ..

One thing I would like to bring is how loyalty to some franchises might pay you in more than one way ...

With mumbai , if you are a MVP like rohit , bumrah , pandya etc. Ambanis take care of you  completely , even in off season ... Medical issue , fitness ..

They have become an all bases covered franchise with experience to manage professional sports.

There is always a after career opportunity with mumbai in some capacity.

Kkr is another such franchise...But  there is no comparison for money mumbai can bring to the table.

Now say you play for revolving door franchise like rr, kxip etc..

You never know how many seasons you would last.

Bailey has one great season soon he was gone...Ashwin came n gone ...Hope kxip stick with rahul.
Rr is also foreign management..

Question is if you are surya kumar yadav or nitish rana or tewatia ...Who is more confident about their role in team going into next season of ipl .

Credit - some insights are from the MI web series .",39
Hope Boulty is fit enough for the final next week. He and Bumrah hunt in pairs and that has been the secret to our success,25

"Just heard the commentators say that Boult's groin injury will keep him out for 8-10 days(probably). So most likely he'll miss the final, which gives their opponents a big advantage.",8

Reallllly hope Boult can play the Finals,6
"Mumbai seems to be everybody's main rival, xD.",4
"Pretty sure bumrah gets paid unofficial money by ambanis, he deserves more than 7-8 crores, he can easily triple it if he goes into auction",6
Bumrah is so 😃😃😃 it makes me so 🤩🤩🤩🥺🥺🥺,6
Is Boult injured?,2
We let Boult go because we play in Kolta where he is useless. That’s it.,5

No boult in the final will hurt MI’s bowling in the powerplay,2
"IPL riches, big money so early in their careers is ruining Indian next generation cricketers.

the rest of DC batted like DC but Stoinis and Axar kinda sus,5
Reminder that these folks drop Axar if you have too many lefties in the other team lmao.,7
Bumrah🙄🥺🥺,5
Bumrah would break bravo's 32 if only they played him against srh.,8
NCN is the only guy in our side that scares me. He hasn't done anything worthwhile this season so far and this might come to bite us in the final.,7

Just an example- NCN was able to bowl 3 runs over because Bumrah took 2 wickets in previous over.",6
Wholesome Bumrah. Single-handedly retaking the fairplay points lost by the Pandya bros,7
Bowl Rohit in the final over you cowards.,12
Axar showing more intent than the entire top order,9
Axar Patel is poor man’s Hardik pandya,0
Guys is Boult ok? Someone plz reply,9
"bowling cheat code is bumrah

batting cheat code is abd",12
Wtf MI already started resting their players for the finals before this match has even ended,14
Hitman century in the finals to win it all for Mumbai. You heard it here first,8
"With Bumrah and Shami in form, we are looking good for Australian test series. If Sharma gets fit, we might actually win but his role is very important.",6
bumrah is the only man to matter right now,4
This MI team must be declared illegal. Cant have so many talents in one team. Break them up :-),11
"But imagine tho, if the match had been close like DC chasing 160 or something people would have been crazy mad about Rohit giving the ball to Krunal or Pollard and holding back Bumrah till the 16th over. Having good players really helps you with captaincy I would say.",9
At this point I don't know whether to root for rcb to watch another shitshow on qualifier 2 or srh to have atleast a chance of  a competitive final,3
Axar Patel to open next match,2
"Who to blame more for this loss? Our management, our batting, our bowling? Or just being simply outclassed by an all time great team?",8

Hardik is a true bakchod,5
Is Rabada better batter than Ashwin?,2
"We should play Aaron Finch tomorrow, he is like our good luck charm even though all he does is score 15 (13).",5
Is it me or any one else feels like NCN just running up and releasing the bowl for the sake of bowling. He had looked pretty average tbh.,8
This Boult injury is making me wonder how we would’ve fallen off the table into a bottomless pit of nothingness if Archer ever got injured,14

"MI fans getting cocky about Bumrah. Lol, even your batsman couldn't survive him. It's a miracle that Axar survived. 4 of our best batsman did.",3
Lol and I thought mega auctions shouldn't be held because DC was stacked,11
I still don't understand why Delhi Capitals owners were piping up  when Axar was going after pollard. It's almost as if they don't know Bumrah still has 2 overs left. Clowns lol.,6
Who’s likely to give the hardest challenge to MI in the final?,4
I would prefer Mitchell over NCN. Can NCN bat through last 3-4 overs and go at 10+ RR. Otherwise Mitchell/Pattinson are much better.,3
MI are definitely gonna be weaker after auction than current side,10

Pollard bowls like a middle aged IT dude playing park cricket but surprises you with proper jaffas.,28

People pressurized  Pant to show some maturity. Seems this young lad has succumbed under pressure. He should play with same clear mind  he used to play like Ishan Kishan.,11
Pollard is bowling his over quicker than Jadeja.,4
"Not Ponting's fault that outside of Dhawan and Stoinis (and a good showing from Axar today), the rest of the batsmen on this DC team are fucking trash. DC is always in trouble if Dhawan doesn't score a ton of runs.

Especially Shaw and Pant. Shaw is pure garbage. Overrated batsman, terrible fielder, terrible fitness. Pant has been ..... mediocre at best. And his WK skills are bad. Iyer is a subpar captain imo.",22

"That last delivery from Pollard was 78 kmph 
Amit Mishra bowls faster",15

Rahul Chahal leading the team off the field after that horrendous spell. Won't be surprised if he's the MOM in the final.,13
The reason Rahul Chahar juggled the catch was becuase Pollard had misfielded a four during his bowling. Chahar wanted to give a heart attack to him.,20
This team will get a second chance. And KXIP/KKR did not qualify. Smh,7
"That's vada pav power, bitches!",12
Delhi have been anything but ruthless. They have been toothless.,5
"In the end, I will take a loss by only 57 runs. At least no one can make memes out of this score. Moral victory",11
"Hey SRH, you and me. Head to Head. Game on.",16
Honestly glad RCB didn't end up 2nd. Would be pretty hard to come back from this. I'd much prefer facing Mumbai in the final with momentum from 2 previous wins. This is assuming they can beat SRH & DC ofc.,15

We had 2 double wicket maidens today didn't we?,21
Is it a positive for DC that they get one more chance or just more misery for DC fans?,10
If Boult isn't available for the finals then they might lose the match. It really would take injuries or some alien abduction to stop MI.,12
Imagine MI buying Mitchell Starc next auction,12
Pant doesn't even have the power to clear the 30 yard circle.,5
Iyer is emotional... my heartbreaks 😭😭😭😭,10
"Iyer: We could had defended 170 here, lmao",15
"""I don't want to talk anything negative about the team""

Some PR guy must have told him to stop saying ""[Player] let the team down""",24
"Chahar's drop in form in recent games in worrying tho, he was right up there with Boult and Bumrah in the start, can't rely on just two bowlers",15
"If delhi would have stopped mi at 170(pandya ke 5 chakke) and not lost the 3 wickets itna jaldi. Delhi would have a good chance. The fact we made 143 despite 0-3 is ok. We might do ok in eliminator, but idk poor 2nd half season.",21
Iyer doesn't even know whether they were chasing or defending,10
Tomorrow match gonna do spicier then today I hope,15
"DC: lost 4 out of last 5

Guys no point in saying DC doesn't deserve to be #2. Your team also had 14 chances to be in similar position but they couldn't. Give credit to MI who are playing like madmen.,43

The best part of this game is Stoinis both batted and bowled well. But you can be sure we won’t promote him to open but will instead bowl more overs from him next game lol.,18
"Half expect Gavaskar to burst out into ‘Parampara, Prathista, Anushashan’ monologues on Hindi comms.",9
MI fans are now gonna want RCB to play bold,8
People here really think SRH have more chances than RCB against MI lol,-5
Iyer has problem with Gujarati people. No surprise.,8
"Fantastic performance by Mumbai, totally outclassed Delhi tonight",6
Shreyas please see to it that we don't qualify for the final cos we're stinking up the playoffs for everyone else except MI.,14

"Can MI rest Bumrah for the finals

Thanks

We scored two and DC were like trying to outscore us in the number of ducks.,14
As a fan It feels sad to see Mumbai boys Iyer and Prithvi fail :),22
Wish KKR or KXIP had been in place of DC,17
Is Lynn related to Jhonny Sins? Or just trying to look like it,14
"Pant with his poor fitness and current form, won’t stay around in the Indian team for long",11
DC in won in most ducks....something to smile about?,11
Alrighty DC boiis gud luck against SRH. GG,16
"If DC dont play Sandeep next game, I am bringing him back home",16
Selectors made a mistake not picking SKY. They look stupid now.,35
MI were so confident they didn't bother letting Boult even finish. (Although Pollard bowling like he's bowling to a 6yo in the final over was just bad sportsmanship),15
Bumrah collecting his MoM award be like: Pichli bar kya bola tha! 3 wickets?,16
Hey SRH fans stop shitting here if RCB and DC can't beat MI you also have no chance against MI,-6
"Don't know what will happen in the Eliminator but I want to see King Kohli play an innings of substance. SR near the 150 mark, and at least 60 runs. He hasn't looked himself for some 4-5 games.",15

Can we reach the final this time or what?,8

Is Boult injured?,7
"rohit vs kohli final will be more mad than batman vs superman,plus there will be no martha to end the fight.",29
If SRH loses against RCB then we might have a chance to reach the final. That's if.,16
"Harsha: Was there a plan batting first

Rohit *in the inside*: Yes me getting a golden duck lol",28
[deleted],37
"Bumrah is going to scratch out Boult's name from that Cred trophy, take it to parties and let everyone believe he won it.",26
"RRRRishabh Pant is right up there with Valthaty, Rahul Sharma, Sran or Bisla. He isnt just a t20 legend but a decent enough part time wicketkeeper, who can bat. He carried the whole ICL team after Rayudu left. What sets him apart from other players is he absolutely demolishes the batting attack. There is no rhythm to his destruction, he dosent care about being stylish or tries to go out of his ways. He plays by his strengths and that's what's allowed him to play for so long. Another thing that I genuinely like about him is how he enjoys the game. It dosent matter if he wins or loses, he's always smiling, dancing and makes you realise at the end of it the sport is just about enjoying yourself and being in the moment, fuck catches or stumpings! I genuinely thought he was done for after he was axed by the Sidemen but he's still going strong. It's a shame he isnt playing in the 100. No matter his form, he is one of the biggest crowd attractions and genuinely one of the most meatloaf evoking players on the planet",23
"***INTENT***
if I had a dollar for everytime this was said",14
Rohit has just put the BCCI on the mat the last two games. ‘What’s all this ‘medical staff will monitor’ bullshit. I am fit’.,25
Need 3 classic Kohli and AB innings and we're set,22
We really fucked up in the bowling department didn't we?,15
Rohit simping for bumrah and boult,42
I don’t think Boult has much of a problem.... says a player who’s showing up in the midst of a hamstring injury,16
BOOM BOOM MOTM,15
Why can't we win against MI? Where are we lacking?,12
BoomBoom So wholesome,10
That dhawan wicket alone deserve motm,23
Bumrah seems rehearsed with most answers. Like a VIVA,16
Twitter's a shit fest as always,14
Ishan Kishan and QDK are look alike wicket keepers.,34
Bumrah is so wholesome🥺🥺🥺👍🏽,32
"Bumrah: I don't care about wickets only team results

Meanwhile, KL is still wearing the orange cap watching the game in his hotel room.",74
"But seriously, how does Bumrah get so many wickets? Doesn't have a lot of natural swing, pace is not the fastest. Mainly line and length and his ability to hit the spot isn't it ?",22
"Bumrah shouldn't wear that Purple cap in final, what if we get the KKR curse",26
We just might be able to reach the finals if RCB eliminates SRH and we beat them,17
Harsha always brings these candid conversations out in the most formal settings.,33
DC is going to lose Q2.. Batting lost their rythm after initial matches.. And now Rabada-Nortje screwing up as well. Truly disappointed.,20
"And to think MI don’t have Malinga

Imagine having to face Bumrah-Boult-Malinga",41
"Abd said it's"" trophy time"" at VK' s birthday party today. So either Rcb wins tomorrow, else that video is going to be meme material.",85
DC and Qualifier 2 don't have a good history,31
How good id hardik as finisher ...he has been a boon for Mumbai,37
Star sports simping on Koach,20
"The fact that guys like bumrah , rabada , rashid still getting heaps of wickets when teams are making strategies to see them off speaks about their skills and quality.",23
Why are we the way we are?,48
I know Malinga is close to retiring from all forms of cricket but I just wanna see Bumrah-Boult-Malinga combo for the 2021 season before they have to separate,30
Rashid vs Pollard in the final would be something to look forward to.,22
Nita Ambani is here. So Motabhai's health is fine.,22
Star sports staff is high on weed lolllll,15
Wtf MI on 20% lmaooo,17
"Let's be honest, MI's gonna win this IPL",22
Damn MI's so dominant,14
Now will the selectors suck up their ego and get the more in-form players like Surya in the Australia tour? Shaw will basically be like Warner was in the Ashes. Form matters more than past performance,35
Who do you guys think will win the IPL? MI?,10
"I just paid 80 dollars for my dog’s haircut. While dropping the dog for the haircut, I missed the 0/3 in the beginning of the innings. Hair cut is awesome too! 


10/10 would pay for the haircut again!",42
Good thing I didn't watch the match. I wouldn't be able to take it.,16
"Bumrah. World class bowler like there never has been. 

Hardik Pandya. Flawless hitter of the ball- what a finisher 

2 great finds by the MI scouting team.",61
Can DC for once go past Qualifier 2?,17
"Continuing on the topic of my dog, it learnt the spin trick faster than Delhi learning they need to open with Stoinis (which to be honest they still might not). 

Hence proved my dog is smarter than the Delhi management.",29
DC and RCB must really be spending an enormous amount on bedsheets.,27
Prithvi Shaw is an absolute abomination. His footwork is horrible and his feet go nowhere! How can he get out for a single digit score (if not a duck) in every match and still show his goddamn face in the next game. I don't understand why Ponting keeps backing him game after game even when he has shown no responsibility whatsoever.,42
"Pant and Shaw are generational talents, they only perform once in a generation.",105
Heartbreak every season.,21
More visibility should be given to ishan kishan as a potential wk batsman for india team. He looks better in terms of consistency and composure than all the prospects out there,23
Can’t even shit on youngsters like Shaw and Pant when Dhawan and Rahane made fuck all.,33
"I would take a captain who is not in the awe of the Mumbai team lol.

Dude comes out in the post match presentation with “They are strong team”, “They can afford to attack early”, etc. 

BC we know all that. Tell us what our team is doing to take them down instead or just step down for someone who believes in the team.",41
Of course this post would have more comments then upvotes lol.,-13
"Rohit, pollard , shaw, dhawan, rahane 5 ducks in one game is that a record?",30
"Is no one going to talk about how dependent MI's bowling is on Bumrah and Boult giving them early breakthroughs? In the last match against SRH they were not even able to take a single wicket, or no one was economical. In today's match too, no one was able to drag the momentum of 31 for 5 forward - I don't understand what Nathan Coulter Nile is doing, or what is his purpose on the team - neither economical, nor a wicket taking bowler. He was used as a strike bowler in the last match and it didn't go well.

So if a team decides to play out Bumrah and Boult overs carefully, they are in good shape for the next 10-12 overs. DC could have won today if they did that.",30
Mumbais batting lineup is just too good. I think they'll win again.,14
How did i find this thread on the top of fp?!,13
Really feeling bad for prithvi shaw,10
Never thought I'd see cricket on the first page of the internet,18
Stoinis should open,2
Funny that ponting once coached mumbai and led them to success and now he is losing to MI as a DC coach. He must be thinking that he should have stayed with MI,10
I don't want Rishabh Pant anymore in the team. This match was a chance to prove himself or at least fight for winning. I hope they bench him for the semi-final's match.,3
i hope prithvi shaw doesnt let this affect his confidence going into the Aus tour. He's clearly got some technical issues but he needs to back himself.,3
