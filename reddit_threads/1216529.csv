Let's go boys.,2
Lets gooo,1
"DC,pls win fam.",4
Way too early isn't it,2
"Udta Punjab for today, or whatever their tagline is, haha. Khelengi aaj Delhi backfoot pe",6
"I don't take happiness in other people's sorrows but holy shit, 1 bad season and the sheer meltdown in the CSK fanbase is something I wouldn't see with other teams. Take a break you guys. Other teams have had it so much worse than CSK and they're much more forgiving. Guess there's always a first time.",71
"Delhi is Sharjah and Dubai bullies, never won a match in Abu Dhabi.",1
I'll just stick to shitposting now guys. :(,3
maxwell will make 100 today watch /s,1
Punjab has been the most entertaining team so far this year.,14
"I want Punjab to win today to make the tournament spicy, although I like Delhi more",3
I'm actually rooting for Punjab. Can't wait to see the madness in the points table if they continue to perform well. Underdogs ftw.,101
[deleted],20
Delhi pls win this . Fate of rajasthan is in your hands!!,3
Easy win for Delhi if pant and hetmyer are back,2
Go Poonjab,0
"Since I watched the match in Tamil, my mother tongues commentary since there are no ads, Punjab has won both games, now I don't believe in that stuff but, if they win again, I'm only watching games in Tamil every day lmao",6
Is there any neutral supporting DC?,2
Go KXIP take my energy !!,1
Good to see Cricket Live Hindi is back in a real studio rather than at the top of some virtual skyscraper.,2
"Punjab lost their first game against DC not being able to handle nerves in a super over

Now after a month Punjab r again facing the same opponent winning 2 nail biting games back to back n acing the super over defeating MI in a double super over

**WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND**",8
I like DC and want Punjab to win (by a short margin) as it will make for an interesting points table.,4
"Big innings from Maxwell coming in, eventually. Maybe today, maybe tomorrow or maybe after 8 more seasons. Fucking clown.",5
I'm still salty about that 1 run in 3 balls match v DC. Why Mayank wanted to hit a six to win? Could have easily taken a single there & 2 points. :/,9
[deleted],62
"Maxwel 9 matches 58 runs 1 wicket for an overseas batting all rounder.

Gowtham 2 matches 42 runs 1 wicket for an Indian bowling all rounder.",11
I wish pant plays today.,3
[deleted],2
Serious question. If lord is released next year then which team will most likely buy him and at what price?,0
"If maxwell had made 1 run in previous match, then punjab would have won without the super over fiesta. Thankyou Maxwell for the exiting and the entertainment you bring in the IPL.",7
"I may not show it, but I missed hearing EASY EASY EASY, in past 3 games",60
"Rishabh, bro, no need to rush back. Take your time and recuperate. Come back fit and firing for the playoffs",43
"Honestly I'd be happy with any outcome in this game. Of course I'm a Delhi fan so if they win great, but I love and am in love with Chris Gayle and low-key want Punjab to make the comeback to the 4th seed. I can watch this game fully enjoying it because I would be happy if either side won.",27
I hope Redditor Neesham plays instead of FlopShow Maxwell,12
7 victories for DC and 7 different player of match awards. And Rabada hasn't been one of them. Crazy!,8
"Prediction time: will discount sehwag get out in first over again?

(Yes)",5
"As a non Indian first time IPL watcher I'm so glad I said DC is the best team


I feel validated.",10
In b4 people start getting annoyed about pant being chatty behind the stumps,4
"If pant defeats the boss in a ""power"" challenge, u should know it's rigged",-1
"Because we were mostly at bottom of table, nobody noticed but Delhi and Punjab have a little rivalry going on from last few years :

2018 : we needed 5 to win on the last ball. Lost. The match made Gautam step down as a captain

2019: The iconic 8/7 match which had Sam fucking Curran taking a hat-trick. ( I still have PTSD from that match)

2020: Punjab failed to chase down 1 off 3. They had a mental block after that for the rest of the tournament. ( + The short run controversy)",66
"C'mon kxip, don't take it to the superover this time tho


Go table toppers crushers",7
"No nortje, lets hope we don't regret that",1
So finally wait is over Daniel sam is playing today,1
"Take maxi out and give it to viljoen, with rahul-mayank,gayle,pooran and Hooda also able to fire, u don't need a useless batsman in there, lineup looks good",1
Been supporting DC since the beginning of the tournament but rooting for Kings XI today.  I want to see them have a decent shot at the playoffs.,3
[deleted],1
I have said this before and will say it again RCB is gonna have a shitshow soon. Not making top 4. WHILE KXIP or RR or KKR willslap up the top 3 and 4 places,1
so tired of all the hotstar ads lmao,2
I am sure punjab would struggle the Sa Pace duo.,1
Will love it if DC wins again but won't be heart broken if Punjab wins. Let's have a fun evening boys,1
Karthik reminds me of a younger version of Moleman from the Simpsons somehow,1
KXIP definitely doing a 2016 RCB,7
TRT Karthicc,2
"**coin spinning midway in the air**


**Iyer:** We're gonna bat first",65
offtopic but MI is literally the most unluckiest plus the most luckiest team in IPL. comeon man they always have to do a shitshow first in the league stages losing won games bcoz of unexpected individual brilliance and somehow clutch playoff close matches matches everytime. WEIRD AND ABSURD but true...,2
"Before people start blasting, Sams is good and the rest was much needed and earned",5
Will Pant play today?,2
[deleted],2
[removed],6
Fk it I'm bullying maxi throughout the match to get him in form cuz kxip won't bench him,5
Yeah Maxwell is sleeping with Preity. No other explanation,25
JORDAN FOR NEESHAM ??? WHAT U DOIN RAHULLLL,5
"DC won the toss and are batting.
Daniel Sams, Hetmyer and Pant in (I am guessing for Nortje, Carey and Rahane)

Neesham in for Jordan",5
"Why tf would you take Jordan out when he finally started bowling well? Well, it's KXIP after all so it makes sense",47
Wait wtf? Jordan was doing well and they brought in neesham? Who will bowl the death overs?,9
They freaking dropped jordan,9
Why is Punjab still playing Maxwell,5
Why would you drop Jordan and keep Maxwell? WTF,11
"hmm, expecting 4 more overs from Maxy after dropping Jordan. 

Arsh and Shami kind of have to bowl in the death. Not sure if I like this change, I thought we had our balanced team.",6
Why did KXIP drop Jordan and why did DC drop Nortje?!,8
Why Neesham for Jordan? It would have been if he replaced Maxwell instead.,9
Who is Daniel Sams?,4
why the fuck would you replace Jordan with Neesham who was so shit,14
[deleted],3
"Well, The NEESHAM CURSE HAS BEEN LIFTED. His team won a second superover afterall so fuckin justice. That's why Punjab brought in him. a quickfire cameo coupled with blazing bowling performance upcoming",7
No Rahane means TV remains off,5
"Wtf is this kxip lineup

Proper batting till 7 n 8 bowling options 

But still qsn remains the same: Who will bowl at death?",4
I am genuinely excited how Sams does today. Also can be a handy bat so ya excited!,1
"nortje is injured or something, or just rested ?",3
Did they drop Jordan cz of stoinis? How's Neesham any better. Jordan finally started nailing those Yorkers but...,7
One loss for KXIP and then spoiling party begins...,2
"Someone explained that the reason for KXIP dropping Jordan was the Stoinis matchup, so fucking stupid if that's the case. 

They should have kept Jordan not only because he's quality, but because the guy who's replacing him is bollocks ANYWAY, with both bat and ball.  

Ugh I'm so pissed. Why could they not have gone with the same team? Jeeeeeeeez",8
Theory: Neesham got hands on maxi x zinta porn,3
"Maxwell was always gonna play after his bowling spell and Delhi has Dhawan Pant Hetmeyer and Axar he can bowl to. 

Dont get why people are so surprised, his record against left handers has always been good",8
Guess we felt we needed more firepower since Pant and Hetmeyer are back thus dropping Jordan for Neesham.,2
"Idk man, jordan was really good with the ball last two matches",5
"Fuck, imagine if KXIP win today and KKR lose tomorrow. The battle for the fourth playoff spot would be unbelievable!",3
"Also, 3 lefties mean Maxi will bowl out. So Neesham can bowl 1/2 overs max and provide some powerhitting spclly against express pace of DC",3
"Would've liked us to give another chance to carey tbh, maybe play him as an opener where he thrives in t20",1
I am glad they dropped Jordan. Idiot doesn't deserve to play another game of cricket the way he ran that second run.,-8
"I trust Arsh more than Shami in death anyway so lets see what happens. 

Shami is so good at bowling yorkers, but being the type of attacking bowler he is, he will bowl length/slower/bouncer deliveries that will go for runs. Arsh didnt do well last match against Pollard, but it was Pollard.",2
Nortje out should be a bit of a relief for KXIP,5
I have a feeling that Murugan Ash is gonna run through DC today.,2
"Why would you drop Jordan, he was doing so good :( I suppose he might be injured in some capacity... Otherwise it sounds like a v bad decision",6
"Hey dc, mind resting nokia on 31st also?",6
Shaw has been a little out of touch lately. The stage has been set for him to find his form again,5
"Delhi should try to chase in remaining matches, they chased in only 2 matches and shit the bad while chasing in 1 out of 2 matches. We do not want repeat of 2009 at any cost, in playoff.",4
"Also cant believe Axar's parents had the balls to name him Axar and not Akshar

Axar Rajeshbhai Patel",24
"Daniel sams? Oh boy, this could get ugly.",7
DC think that we are so shit that they are giving a rest to Nokia. What a flex,8
"CSK : *arrrgghhhh maaah gawwddd,fuck thala,fuckoour lives*

KXIP fans : ""*first time?*""",9
"I had no clue who Daniel Sams was, then I googled and realized I saw him plenty in the BBL",4
Now this is where Sams is gonna prove whether he’s a BBL track bully or whether he’s actual quality.,1
KXIP probably also making Maxwell drive crew bus back and from hotel to get that ROI,5
Shouldn't have dropped Jordan imo. Guy was executing perfect toe crushers,3
I really don't see any reasoning of Neeshem replacing Jordan other than an injury which Rahul didn't mention.,2
"Lmao, dropped Jordan for Neesham. Are they dumb? Or Jordan injured? Is it because of his super lazy run that caused super over?",0
Daniel sams looks like Thom yorke. Yay or nay?,3
[removed],1
"Alright lads, who do we need to get back into form today?",2
Why is Nortje not playing ?,1
Barest of margins,1
Maybe Gayle should open along with mayank,2
Neesham is finally playing,1
"I wud have played Nortje today. Allow the best bowling pair of the tournament to go against best batting pair n see who stands where. 

If he really needed the rest, I wud have rested him next game against good guys KKR.",5
James Neesham finally getting a game,1
Punjab looks like a solid team,1
Another two day match please. lets go bois,4
"Maxwell has Rahul's nudes, confirmed!",11
"JImmy Neesham replaces Chris Jordan

Not Maxwell !!",3
I feel with Daniel Sam in there's a Gayle Strom coming,2
Shaw is Do or Die personified,6
Guys no sub for discussing fantasy 11 ?!!,5
"I am calling Neesham's half century, with his bowling",1
"Idc about the result, more super overs please",2
"Nortje has a niggle. Oh man, we're riddled with aches and pains this season.",5
Ash vs Chris is going to be very interesting man.,5
Fuck me Sams is an all rounder,6
Lmfao did Sanga just call him D-bag Hooda?,3
"Idk why they brought in Neesham for Jordan, he can’t even bowl in death which is what Punjab need",8
Sams t20 record is excellent fuck,5
"If i say something, folks can’t take it lol.",4
I'm a big fan of Rahul Mayank. But please open with Gayle. Then it's the best ~~top2~~ top 4 of the tournament,4
I am really torn apart choosing between dugout and commentry today with kumar sangaakara and Mark Nicholas,3
They dropped Jordan for Neesham? I think Maxi is playing as a pure bowler then. Can be a good move looking at all the lefties in DC.,6
What happened to Nortje? Resting him or he's injured?,3
Inb4 Maxi's 50 (13),8
Neesham over Jordan? Is this a twitter competition,4
"*Super Over exists*

KXIP Supporters: Arey mujhe chakkar aane laga hai",7
"Bowling a spinner in the first against Shaw, DaOne. Bold move",4
Why are they not pressing the GOLDEN BUZZER to send KXIP directly to the semiFinal. Such a exciting team to watch.,2
Whoever came up with the idea of the dugout commentary was a genius,5
Is ma boi prithvi gonna score today or is gonna go for duck once again. Excited!,4
"Daniel Sams was pretty great in the BBL, so should be interesting to see how he does. Can bat a bit too.",1
Where is keemo Paul,1
Is Sanga on the comms today might switch from the Dugout if so?,1
[deleted],1
NO DUCK FOR SHAW,3
Can I watch dugout on star sports?,2
"Guys, I have a question. Why is KL having that Orange cap in the crotch area?

So that Mayank wouldn't wear it?",3
Shaw got out to pace twice in a row for ducks. Let's open with spin,13
Discount sehwag vs specialist bowler,5
Mate what,2
Pooran wtf,2
Poo from Pooran,2
Maxwell was bought as the opening bowlers by KXIP. His batting was just a bonus.,6
"Playing for a super over already I see

/s",4
"Neesham replaces Maxwell.  
Fans: YES finally!!   


Maxwell replaces Jordan.   
Fans: ........",9
Unacceptable from Pooran after that cracker of a save on the boundary in one of the earlier games,1
Pooran's gotta do something amazing in the field later.,1
Thank you for not opening with a seamer against Shaw. He needed that,8
I know KL Rahul-Mayank worked so well as opening pair for them but I hope they let Gayle and Mayank open.,3
So it begins,3
Finally somebody taking it to Maxwell. I like this.,3
Oh no. Oh no,1
"By the way guys, Deepak Hooda does not sound like you’d expect him to",2
"Not a bad record against Shikhar

E: nvm",1
Oh boy. Dhawan is in some serious form here.,1
Good work Shawan. That is exactly the treatment Maxwell's bowling deserves,2
Why no Nortje?,1
Finally shaw has opened his account,1
Now Maxwell bowling is shit too,0
So punjab are coming with hattricks of win.,1
Yup this game is done,-2
"Why the fuck KXIP is changing teams for no reason? 

Ffs Jordan was decent in that super over and he still can do better if given more chances and he batted decently too",8
Mi playing 69D chess by bringing Dhawan to form,3
"Jumble really doesn't have balls to drop Maxwell.

Indians are biased towards Aussie overseas players",5
"Maxwell is bowling well.

""give him first over""",2
Pooran needs to fine tune his game. For a talented batsman he sure sure does fuck up a lot.,4
What a phenomenal start for DC!,1
Oh fuck that was almost it,1
13 runs in the over. Nice,2
Motherlover vs motherlover. Let's go!,7
Maxwell when he realized he is in the team for his bowling...,2
Maxwell again. This team has no brain. And gave him the first over smh,1
"Shaw 100, calling it..


Didn't get out in first over",2
"Dhawan: ""Get the fuck outta your part-timer""",5
What is shaw starts tonking maxwell. That has be his career ending spell.,1
So Maxwell is basically useless now?,2
Kumble's masterstroke failed in first over lol.,0
So since Maxwell is a specialist spinner these days doesn’t jt make sense to instead bring in cotterel? More effective than Glenn will ever be In the bowling department,0
"It was really difficult to get a live match thread among myriads of CSK/Dhoni rant threads, lol.",3
">Maxwell to Dhawan, FOUR, messy fielding! Pooran the culprit at point and a dot ball turns into a boundary. Can't afford such lapses, not against a side like DC.

---
>. Can't afford such lapses, not against a side like DC.

DC fans had to wait for such a long time for this to happen.",20
Trying to play out maxis 4 overs early wont work every match.,1
Dhawan really shifted gears in last few matches.,2
Feels weird to see Shaw last this long,6
Great save KL.,7
Wow aren't we starting well today...,2
The only way kxip can win is if Rahul talks about mutual funds with iyer while playing fifa,9
"DC having to play whack a mole with injuries. Just when Pant is fit, Nortje has a niggle. Hopefully they are all fit come playoff time.",0
"Still hate that fake background noise. Thought I might get used to it as the tournament goes on but no, still annoying.",-1
"If the player is not in the form open them, it doesn't matter bat or ball. IPL 2020",5
Wait wtf we dropped Jordan? Fuck kumble,2
Even dugout feels Shaw is a walking wicket,2
[deleted],1
Dropping Jordan was unnecessary and damaging,8
Hoping for 200+ run fest,1
Shaw has already scored more than what was expected of him.,1
Shaw's looking sus. Swinging like his last day on the ground.,0
So Punjab have a genuine wicket-taking bowler with the new ball when it's swinging. But they would rather give the ball to Maxwell to take pressure off the openers and let them settle in. Nice.,3
Why new comments are not automatically updating :),1
"I feel like Maxwell offers some extra services to Franchise owner, to cement his place in playing XI",2
Gabbar looking royal. What a treat.,2
Cottrell atleast used to take early wickets. Just don't bowl him at death.,6
"Dont mention Ajinkya comm box ok please, thank you",2
Shaw needs to play his natural game,2
Shaw looks looks like a walking wicket. Rahane at least look more solid.,2
Fuck kartik in comms. Imma head out.,1
Prithvi Shaw looking at what food items are available after his batting. /s,4
Prithvi is proof that earth is not flat but plump,4
KXIP have to lose for dropping the best second super over bowler,2
Jordan is probably taking the shortest route from hotel to the ground. So he is late! and had to be replaced,3
"**IPL Season vs Number of tied matches**

2009 - 1

2010 - 1

2013 - 2

2014 - 1

2017 - 1

2019 - 2

2020 - 4",3
Big PP or small PP tonight?,1
2nd catch that almost carried :(,3
The lord single handedly made the kxip management lose trust in cortrell,4
"Seeing Maxwell opening the bowling reminded me of 2012 Deccan Chargers. I remember a game when Shikhar Dhawan opened the bowling (yes, you read that right). What a joke of a side!",13
No logic in dropping Jordan unless he’s unfit or something,8
The fake crowd noises are so loud that I can't even hear the commentators at times tonight. Turn that shit down,2
"Shaw looking sketchy, needs to calm down a bit.",1
Dugout went all in for wicket alerts for Shaw,1
"3rd catch that almost carried, fuck. Let it not be one of those days please.",3
Why aren't they playing cottrel? Is he injured?,2
Anyone else watching on kayo and having it lag like crazy?,1
"give maxwell a role, and he will remind you he can do the other one better

Except it never stops",4
"With the entertainment value KXIP gave in their past two matches... I wouldn't be too mad if they took this one as well. 

Although it would be good to have DC confirmed to make playoffs tonight already.",4
Shaw looks like he is just trying to get the bat on the ball withiut estimating where it might end up,1
Who's the thin Rohit Sharma talking to Rahane?,4
Shaw looks uncomfortable out there. Don't bring Maxi back ffs,1
Shaw trying his best to get out to give company to Maxwell's form,2
How the F#ck people compared Shaw to young Sachin. The guy has worse footwork than Chris Gayle. Zero improvement since he burst on the scene.,2
"Aussie players: Exist

Indian coaches in IPL: Oh fuck yeah, pick it",21
Why is maxwell playing again?,1
Any particular reason jordan was dropped?? He was just catching his form,2
"Dhawan is the antonym of Samson. Scratchy at the start of the tournament like he’s totally out of form, gets better as the tournament goes and does best in the knock-out games.",4
Unpopular opinion- DC should have rested Shreyas because in the last game he wasn't at his best and if his injury becomes more severe it will affect DC a lot...,2
Seeing Shami bowl 6 yorkers in the last over he bowled (before this) and now seeing him bowl wides here - [Everyone](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/359/cover4.jpg),3
"Great over, damage control",2
I just realized its shaw's 3rd season and he is still shit.,7
Only just noticed Shikhar bats with a kookaburra. His transformation into an Aussie is almost complete.,70
"Some people are so fickle, initially after Hetmyer had a couple of off games they were like bring Carey then after watching Carey and Rahane for a couple of games they then wanted Hetmyer back",24
"Arsh will get Prithvi, dont worry lads.",2
"I so want Maxwell to perform, no excuses for poor performance but his morale is probably at an all time low",5
Is Shaw Punjab’s 12th player ?,1
Fucking hell but is Bangur's vocabulary limited to **brilliant** and some other generic superlatives a 4th grader would use?,9
Prithvi looks like a walking wicket,2
Only way to bring maxi in form is to send him to rcb and then get him out of there,14
Punjab needs to get rid of Shreyas and Shikhar Dhawan cheaply to give themselves an edge over Delhi,2
"Shaw 🤝Maxwell

Living off past glories",7
Arsh's economy doesn't reflect how he's actually done unfortunately. Things always return to their mean so its fine.,2
"The Jordan Neesham swap strengthens the batting considerably.  
Maybe, KXIP have resigned themselves to chasing a high total.  
Defensive move",3
Agressive shaw sr 33.33,-2
"Bangar has good enough analysis but fails to communicate it well. Oh well, it's hard to speak a second language",10
"This Maxwell experiment as opening bowler has to die. It worked in couple matches, good, won't work at all against in-form batsmen like Dhawan.",1
"Prithvi shaw takes guard

Dugout: WICKET ALERT lmo",61
So shaw is Sehwag not Sachin,5
Prithvi Devdutt Shubman Shaw,4
Seems the surgeon of death did a swap on Gabbar and Shaw.,2
"Just tuned in

Good to see our ""de-sensitized to super overs"" reddit boy playing today",3
"Ah, unlucky",0
As an RCB fan who should I be supporting,4
"Shaw is having a shaky start, maybe he needs this to catch some bit of form.",1
Thank god Nokia isn't playing. Is his replacement any good?,1
Prithvi Shaw is 20. My man's out here looking like Rashid Kahn's father.,67
"KL Rahul is following his Idol blindly. Bat like him , take decision  like him , give excuses like him and look like him.",-3
I can’t believe they made Mark Nicholas read that credit card rubbish,1
"If they can get some overs out of Hooda then dropping Jordan isn't really a bad move 
 
They'll still regret it if they end up giving like 80 in last 6 overs though",0
Let's see if Kxip can bring Shaw back to form...,0
Prithvi Shaw looks like a tin beer,2
Prithvi doesn't use the feet to much because he is afraid that a hole might form in the pitch if he did,2
Don't worry prithvi we will let you score big with our shitty deliveries so that you can cement your place for rest of tournament - KXIP bowling attack,3
"Arsh can probably gain speed after putting some muscle on that frame, given his body can handle it well. A good long term project for Indian bowling",1
So happy that we memed Dhawan into this form,6
Ok why is Neesham picked over Jordan? Didn't it make more sense to drop Maxwell instead of Jordan?,2
Dhawan is in some form,3
Shikki pa needs to get out,0
Ravi Shastri uncle would have been been fun-fantastic addition to Dugout,4
"So yeah , saw that Jordan is dropped again after giving that performance against MI. KX why the fook aren't you playing consistent 11?",4
Unpopular opinion : Prithvi Shaw won't ever cut it in Indian team. Maybe a few t20s here and there but not a regular. He isn't improving as well as others in his position are.,1
Would be fun if KLPD wins this in super over again,1
"Cover drive was invented just so Left handers can play it.
Change my mind",4
Everyone praise Dhawan and jinx....plzzz,0
I have never seen Dhawan’s IPL batting so ultra pro Max aggressive,1
DC are so damn lucky to have Dhawan getting back in form at the crucial point of the tournament,5
Need to get Shikhar out asap. He looks so confident.,2
I am going to change my chawanprash name to dhawanprash so I can open my day with a bang.,19
Holy fuck Shaw’s technique is so bad. Needs to fix the huge holes before he plays for India again,3
"Dhawan's game just keeps getting better the deeper his side goes in a tourney.  
Its like his hands and feet start working in sync.  
I think he's slightly underrated, never slows down in anticipation of a landmark. Quite fit and a decent set of hands in the field.",6
Pepper fry model is an Indian Milf.,0
Alright MCC president put under the cosh about the bouncer rule,3
Shaw and piyush Chawla probably have eat offs during off seasons,4
He's here lmao,3
"Ooo nice, Neesham has a good seam position usually",3
Shaw’s shots are a stark contrast for the worse when you look at dhawans batting,1
Prithvi's really struggling eh? Cant put that away either,3
"Ugh one more over from Shami and he would have gotten Shaw

Edit: Maybe Neesh works too",3
The ledittor is here,2
Good one max,1
r/cricket having a hard on rn,3
Noice,1
I think Kl showers with the orange cap too,6
[deleted],6
Maxwell or hooda will take out Dhawan because it's a kxip match,0
Shaw's poor form continues.,1
Oh no.... Anyway!,4
Neesham making us proud!!,5
Has Cottrell not been picked since the Lord Tewatia thing?,4
that's an absolutely filthy hack,6
Perfect catch from specialist fielder,7
Damn sucks for KXIP,4
Shaw beta Bat ki galti nahi hai. Usse mat dekh haath jod raha hu. Khud ke andar dekh,5
Visual representation of the meaning of braindead right there.,1
Nesh does it,1
Make reddit proud neesham,4
NEESH!!!! REJOICE r/cricket,3
Prithvi Shaw living up to the expectations everyone had from him,2
"As someone who bashed Dhawan for his batting during the match against MI, I'm happy to take those words back. He's been a different player ever since. This is solid T20 opening, wonderful turnaround from him.",1
"Unpopular opinion but Punjab wasting the advantage of new ball by giving it to part times, but by the time I ended this comment, Prithvi has proved me wrong.",6
"Maxwell taking catch, step #1 to come out of depression",3
"James Bond drinking a non-alcoholic beverage goes against the very essence of what 007 stands for.  
Bond in the books is supposed to be...not happy about his situation, a cynic through and through. He masks his borderline alcoholism through a veneer of coolness. Ad doesn't work for me",3
Free wicket at the top!,0
Shaw looked like getting out from the first ball today,1
Hence Neesham > Maxwell,1
Prithvi Shawmson,3
What's Neesham's reddit username?,1
Shaw-shank no redemption,3
In u/unleashthequiche we trust,2
Shaw will go back to eating in the dressing room now,2
Neesham getting the first wicket...how the turntables,1
Drop Shaw please,1
"Congrats, we doubted Neesham into form",0
He was a walking wicket lol,-1
One of the ugliest non CSK batting innings imo,-1
Shaw really seems to be struggling with confidence,1
Not even mad anymore. Just feel bad for the kid.,1
Reddit represent is here,1
Is Nokia Injured? or is he just out cuz they wanna experiment,1
*Insert comment about Neesham using reddit here*,5
I had a dream last night that Rabada took 8 wickets in this game. I don't think that's actually going to happen but I'm writing this just in case it does and I'm psychic,1
"Sad to see the pressure getting to him, he has the talent to go all the way but needs to work on his backfoot",1
Surprised Shaw even lasted this long,2
"Every team has one free wicket, for DC its Shaw.",6
"I swear if i played a shot with that technique Pant played with, my coach wouldnt let me live peacefully",1
"**3.2** Neesham to Shaw, OUT,  **25-1**

PP Shaw c Maxwell b Neesham 7 (11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.63",1
Atleast now the real batting of DC can start,2
Was Akash Chopra trolling Neesham? That was piss poor even by Chopra's standards. World cup jibe is totally unnecessary.,7
Maxwell atleast making up for his trash anting form with fielding and to a lesser extent his bowling,2
Maxwell is still an amazing fielder,2
Hopefully Iyer coming in earlier during the powerplay gives him more opportunity to build momentum so he doesn't get stuck during the middle overs.,2
"Shaw out of form is a good thing for us in the playoffs, could get an early breakthrough.",4
"Ok, another cheap failure. Shot selection is still an issue. Seems low on confidence after those ducks. Ponting needs to have a talk and boost him up..

And yes, people who will start again with Rahane instead of Shaw, please, Shaw is inconsistent but a match winner on his day. Rahane is inconsistent and not a match winner in T20.",5
Shaw is also on the Samson Inconsistent Academy,3
We still have to deal with Shaw in the field where he really brings the net negative lol.,2
Has prithvi always been samson 2.0 ?,1
Ravi shashtri lite is gonna become alcoholic due to this IPL season,2
"What a bizarre innings. 7(11)

Other than the first ball he nudged for a single, he tried hitting almost every ball for a boundary and also could've been out 3-4 other times.",3
"At least he scored 70.  


Oh, wait.",3
"Desert storm more like desert phus

Sachin Imposter",2
Reddit takes a wicket,7
Just remove Maxi and bring in Jordan and the team will be better,1
Earthboy has lost his form? I see Jinx opening for DC in future.,1
Shaw came to practice his hugs,3
Why tf did they play Neesham?/s,3
[deleted],-1
Redditor gets a wicket,11
Man he could've easily played second fiddle here and try to settle himself in especially with Dhawan going aggressively at the other end but well ehh..,4
That's 10 balls more than I expected Shaw to last,8
"Who else wants to see Cornwall, shaw, chawla in the same team",2
I can sense a flurry of wickets,0
Shaw looking more like Samson than Sachin,6
Not sure how people can say they'd rather have Shaw over Gill in their team.... At least Gill is predictable,1
"As I am getting older, I am not finding in myself to criticize players so young given they have already achieved far more than I have. Does anyone have this issue or is it just me?",3
I still dont get what is going on with the kxip management? Why’d they sit jordan/cottrel and let maxi play...,2
Maxwell: hahaha quota done,9
Jus wanna see rahane for shaw and carey for hetmyer for one game. nothing against Shaw but we struggle to stitch together strong partnerships at the top and make it just a little bit tougher for the bowlers,0
"If this is the guy you’re a huge fan of it must take very little to earn your adulation. Shaw gets out way too many times to wild slogs, has no control over the shots.",-1
"I was just beginning to wonder how come Shaw's still not out. Next ball, he gets caught.",5
"So, Rohit-Mayank to open in Australia. It's settled then",7
The bromance is unstoppable,3
Shaw is the new samson.,10
"lol they compared this kid to Sachin, even at 18 sachin had amazing technique",5
How many more chances for Shaw? Should he be sacked?,5
Kinda a relief that Shaw is gone...,0
Why not play Jordan? He actually did pretty well last game.,2
It remains that the only thing I like about Shaw is that he gets out quickly and give others a chance to save the game.,3
NEESHAM MAKING US PROUD,6
Why DC always play with 10 players,4
Rahane and dhawan should open. Rahane can hold from 1 end.,3
Well that was a *Shaw-rt* innings.,7
"Prithvi bats like someone who reads all the Sehwag comparisons and believes it now. He's an opener, someone needs to tell him he's allowed to play himself in before he starts swinging like a mad man.",3
Shaw acts like the uncle in gully cricket who doesn’t want to run so he smacks every ball regardless of how trash the ball is,6
"Whatever you do, KXIP, don't make another close game. *Thak gya hu bro*",4
"There are soo many Sachin imposters out there.  
Rayudu was touted as Sachin 2.0, then it was Shaw's turn.  
Point is you won't become Sachin just cause you started playing at a young age or have similar looking shots/stance.  
Tendulkar at his best...found ways to score. He put shots in cold storage if they got him out and he was always open to learning new things.  
I remember him playing helicopter shots for 4 in the IPL at the fag end of his career.  
You gotta copy his work-ethic, not just his stance",9
Maybe Shaw was hungry again and left to have his dinner.,5
"I think they select shaw in the 11 to show us common folk how difficult international cricket is.

And this is what will happen if any of you are sent in the middle.",4
Jimmy Neesham looks like a French model who took a break from Paris fashion show to play IPL,49
"DC, I love y'all, but I really hope you lose today. Wanna see KL in the playoffs, I've been hyping him up in all these match threads and I really need him to back up my words",8
"Ppl saying Gill shud stop playing run a ball knocks n play shots like Shaw even of he get out

Shaw making 7 of 11 lol",6
What a beauty from Iyer. Just makes it look so easy,4
DC can afford to rest Shaw for few games. Bring in Rahane since Dhawan is anyway the aggressor now.,1
My word that's some shot,3
Iyer punished a Redditor. Ceiling gang confirmed,6
Bwoah,3
Beautiful,1
"Bad ball again, shami gonna come back to tighten this",3
People comparing Shaw with Sachin. At 18 Sachin had already fucked his Bullys mom,7
Maxwell: Aight I'm done for the night,5
Captain with a 6ix to balance the lost wicket in this over. Momentum is still on DC's side.,3
Bruh Shaw looks like he aged 15 years since New Zealand series.,4
Neesham becomes a competent powerplay bowler? This subreddit would have a bigger boner than himself,4
Oh skip,3
Shaw's giving good exposure to the middle order,2
That's not an easy shot to play. Shreyas you beauty,5
Wtf that was a leading edge for 6,-2
I love Sanga's voice,1
Thank god for that six. What a shot as well. Can't let a Jimmy Neesham over in the powerplay go for 1 run and a wicket.,23
Pooran is so fine,3
cant decide whom to hate on - shaw or samson,0
"I think this Delhi team is too OP now. With Pant at 4, Hetmyer at 6, Daniel Sams at 8. Big hitters everywhere.",2
Bangar showing excitement through his commentary is equivalent to Porno actors 'acting',3
"Remember when Shaw got a fifty against csk and kkr??


Feels like years",4
Is this sharjah?,3
Watching Shreyas bat calms all my frustration from watching Shaw bat,7
Is Shaw the most overhyped youngster of all all-time?,4
these RBI ads with cricketers reminds me of school plays the way they speak their lines.,5
"Shaw need to join MI to improve his game, some motivation to play for hometown",9
"Hopefully, Shaw is not the first choice opener for the Indian team for the Tests in Australia.",4
"Iyer hits the best sixes, from current Indian team.",11
"Why is Jordan dropped here , didn't he bowl well In the second super over to keep Mumbai to a gettable total",12
"Samson : No one can be a Dhoni.
Gambhir : Samson is a Samson.
Shaw : I'm Samson!",8
"Don't worry, it's just dc trying to fool Rahul into thinking Neesham is a good bowler so that he bowls him in the death",12
"When Shaw came back from his ban last year, SMAT, he directly replaced Jay Bista in the Mumbai team, I was so pissed lol Bista was having a pretty good season until then, had a great partnership with Tare but they broke it up.",5
Bangar with his fake excitement,4
Shaw being a free wicket and a free extra 5 runs to the opponents on the field,5
Ah unlucky,2
Oh fuck me,1
Shaw shouldn't have taken that 'cough syrup',4
"If the technology from White Christmas in Black Mirror becomes real at least on TV I would like to remove certain repetitive people from ads for premium price and go even more into my extreme filter bubble.

Primary triggers: AB, MSD, SRK, AK, Salmon, DP, ABhatt etc.",3
Shaw is just an underdeveloped Sehwag without Ganguly to guide him,9
"Wait Sams is playing?

What is this? Big Bash?",12
"Where do you think Neesham will be posting after this match, tifu or happy?",10
Okay. Who is that Discount Ishant Sharma next to Axa?,1
"Would genuinely take an L today if it means KXIP reach the playoffs. They've got way too good a side to miss out. Much, much better than Rajasthan, Kolkata, Hyderabad.",1
Shaw is such a walking wicket now. Painful watching him bat.,1
"I dont see why kxip still wanna ride maxwells dick, like that bitch not doing anything. Give that position to neesham or something man. It’s ridiculous",3
"The way Shaw is playing, I won't be surprised he does a ""KLPD Eng 2018"" in upcoming Aus test series. If you know, you know.",0
Shami almost had him chopping on!,4
"Prithvi Shaw this season 5,64,2,66,42,19,4,0,0,7. This sucks for him.",4
Glad to see Pant is back! Dude is our future,8
"\+0.921 and +1.203, The top 2 teams are miles ahead in terms of NRR compared to the rest of the teams. This shows that they not just got 12 or 14 points, they have got it convincingly.",8
Mayank/Rohit in Aus actually looks really good not gonna lie. No one else deserves the spot,4
I think the decision to leave Shaw out for Rahane would do the former more good than bad.,3
Gabbar looking in touch,3
Dhawan starting blazing fast.,5
Dhawan just dumped the tuk-tuk and is now aboard a lambo,5
Dhawan's 8 ball is shining bright,3
Shikhar is amazing,3
Is this comment visible?,3
Dhawan went to an enchantment table and got a fortune 100 enchantment on his gloves,5
Dhawan looks infallible now,2
Fuck Shikha is in good form. I mean take no prisoners kind of form.,4
Dhawan is what Warner thinks he is,4
An on-song Shikhar Dhawan is beautiful to watch. ICC tourney feels.,2
Idk left handed power hitting is so satisfying to watch,7
"MI might have the most dominant wins, but DC deserves an award for winning games despite having to carry Shaw in the XI",9
Atleast donot gift a ball to a inform batsman shami !!!,3
Get Dhawan out please or i am fucked in Fantasy,4
Dhawan is in such good touch!,3
"Poor Shami, poor",3
I slapped my thighs for that shot,7
"Dhawan operating at another level now, let's meme Shaw into form now thanx",9
Fuck off I hate this game,10
If Team India was finding no. 4 . Why didn't they choose Iyer.,8
Someone nerf Dhavan and remind him that this is not ICC tournament,38
200 on the cards bois,3
LOL slow mo fall,5
"It was moronic to not play Jordan. Pay the price now, Jokers XI Punjab.",16
Lara said Dhawan will score only 8 due to Shami threat. Lol,11
love it when they goof around lol,8
I like how before this IPL there's a clear line between Samson and Pant supporters. Now everyone seems to be rooting Pant.,11
rip punjab,-2
"Ah yes, 2015 spanking ptsd",6
Whats with us bowling so short of length today,1
[removed],8
That dive tho lmao,10
200 incoming,4
Fucking love Dhawan,2
Does Dhawan think that we're playing the Champions Trophy?,6
Someone tell shikhar this isn't an ICC Tournament,3
"I would love Shikhar Dhawan more than my future wife. What a fucking character, man. ❤️❤️❤️❤️",3
TheOne is everything SRH fans think Warner is this season.,2
[deleted],0
Shikha makes a point to be friendly with bowlers he has hit for boundaries. Good guy Shikha.,3
Dhawan taking-the-piss streak reaches match 4,7
Dhawan is in ICC form. Go off king,4
"Dhawan is so much fun on the pitch, especially when he's in good form.",5
"Klr already has that ""ah shit here we go again"" look",5
Coming late. Did Prithvi Shaw play today?,2
"Do you guys think IPL teams use tactics showed in movie ""money ball"" to pick players? If not will advanced analytics would be useful to pick players in a sport like cricket. Really interested in knowing if science can help teams.",1
how long till Shikhar isn't around the Indian national set up and can complete his full Australian transformation by playing for the Melbourne Stars as a local player?,5
"Ipl Maxwell is a wannabe abd

Change my mind",1
"A wicket would nicely do, please and thanks Arsh",-1
"Dhawan on a mad run of form, KL might have competition for his orange cap soon",8
I goddamn love Shreyas's head position when he hits sixes. So still and so straight. Gives himself the best position to execute,4
*Sigh* KL Rahul’s gonna end up batting 4 for India in T20s isn’t he?,1
"I’m sorry but jimmy is an avg all rounder in t20. He can’t even bowl in the desth, dropping Jordan was a bad decision unless it was an injury or smt",4
"Stop this bullshit, Shaw is not going to even be in the running for the stupid Emerging player award...",3
MI may have the most balanced side but DC have the infectious laughs of Marcus Stoinis & Shikhar Dhawan.,7
Hey guys looks like we are going to be in thr 7th position again today wOw?!,5
He is DaOne,2
Is this Sams guy good? why didn't they go with J Richardson or Beherndorf over him?,0
"Nobody has bowled particularly badly, and still Delhi going at 9 RPO",10
Arsh takes out iyer this over,1
Shaw literally has a technical problem with every ball-short pitch- can’t play. Good length- edges it. Full one-gets bowled .,4
We are getting fucking wrecked,2
Heard with changes now India might play all 3 ODIs and T20s in Sydney now. Dhawan will be useful with Sharma not looking at his absolute best.,3
Shaw has just made enough runs to cover up for the misfields he's gonna do later,7
How can a batsmen decide in milli seconds which shot to play? (like how Dhawan scored for shami s delivery),6
The thigh thumper looks in unreal form,3
"I distinctly remember just one to two weeks into the tourney there were calls for Shaw, Gill and Samson to play for the Int'l side and dispense with the likes of Shikhar Dhawan cause he was washed and old. These takes were pretty popular too. 

Just shows that good fundamentals and experience is priceless and always comes good eventually. Dhawan been a big match player for years. I've always feared him and he's been a LOI stalwart.",16
Wtf I love this confident Dhawan,11
"Please Dhawan, don't throw away your wicket this over.",5
"Man, both our openers (Brohit and Gabbar) just relishes short balls.. amazing to watch!!",2
Whos that guy always next to Kumble,2
This is where DC is different from other teams. They score at 10-11 rpo in powerplay. While other teams struggle.,5
Dhawan playing like it's sharjah,6
DC not gonna commit mistakes like MI last match. They wanna stay at the top at all cost.,4
letting hetmeyer and maxi bat at number 3 or 4 for one or two matches might let them play without much pressure and boost their confidence,7
Anyone know how to stop my kayo from repeatedly buffering once or twice a minute while chromecasting? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!,1
ICC IPL Dhawan.,7
Rahane should come in next game for shaw,1
I missed the emerging player eligibility by 12 days. Feeling old,-1
Reminds me of 2013 CT Dhawan,5
"Why TF are people talking about our test opening partnership? 

1) It will be Mayank and Rohit because Shaw did not do enough to replace Rohit whilst the latter was injured.

2) It will not be based on IPL performances. Rohit was brought back in to the test team because he has a long history of international cricket and Shastri rates him, not because of some T20 knocks. I understand the management's selections are weird sometimes, but if you look at who Kohli and co have given debuts and chances to, you'll see that India is consistently one of the best countries at rewarding domestic first class and A team performances. We believe in our red ball pipelines. IPL is not relevant.",13
[deleted],4
Shaw is in no form.,2
"People thinking Iyer is a C Grade player, guy is India's 4 now and is DC's Captain for a reason",41
Was Shaws cough syrup incident a cover up for something worse or something like that does happen due to misunderstanding?,1
So who's the leading candidate for the emerging player in this edition of IPL??,-1
"Mi let Dhawan be cuz he was his sr was low

Rr let Dhawan hit a 50 at 200 sr

Csk being wholesome gave him 4 chances

And now...... we've created an absolute monster",6
"For the first time, I'm not officially eligible for emerging player award. It's depressing af",13
How about this criteria. Any foreign player who played more than 150 ipl matches will not be considered in foreign quota.,-4
"Dhawan body clock is supposed to perform in oct-nov 2020 as world cup was supposed to happen now.

That is also why he did not perform in September.",103
200 possible?,4
"Match starts.

Commentator: Shaw on the crease. Don't blink. You might miss it.",10
Pant is getting thick.,1
This match is truly gonna be a match between No. 1 team and No. 7 team. Domination by DC so far.,-2
"This Emerging Player criteria is stupid. You cannot be eligible if you have a national cap lol. 

 Shaw is in the list lmao. This dude emerged, got banned for six months, re-emerged and declined. Sure ""Emerging player of the year"" contender.",9
What is this strike rotation I'm seeing? I thought that 1's and 2's were no longer part of t20's.,0
"As soon as I am born before ~~than~~ the emerging player date, I'll go into an existential crisis",18
Is Deepak hooda any good?,1
"Got to get in Bishnoi at the earliest now after power play and look for wickets, but pretty sure Rahul will keep him away from left hander",-2
Why nokia is out of network?,9
Someone tell Dhawan this is not an ICC event,8
Dhawan batting like THE-ONE man army,1
Dhawan looks in imperious form,3
When technically deficient batsmen are out of form they look awful. Precisely how Shaw is looking right now.,7
"First it was 3d and now it's neesh

The part timer having the best bowling figures",3
"Dhawan is fit as a fiddle.. how come Shaw isn't even embarrassed to see his opening partner almost twice his age is a better outfielder, better catcher, better runner between wickets and even a better batsman. What the hell has he learnt from Dhawan till now.. zilch.",24
"With Shastri being big fan of Dhawan feels our T20 WC top 4 will be Dhawan, Sharma, KL, Rohit. He's only 34 and looks fit.",-3
Why is kxip not bowling their best bowler Maxwell?,-1
I think virat is taking IPL play off qualification courses in great learning,6
You know it was a good powerplay when the bowling side takes strategic timeout immediately.,2
IPL - ICC Premier League is how Shikha sees it.,8
"Dhawan has been nuts last three games. If he comes into the t20 india xi, who will need to go out.",-2
"should bring in M Ashwin, have a feeling he will get Dhawan",0
Why would that kid with icecreams need automatic parking assistance?,4
Gavaskar absolutely right,-2
Why is there so much weed on the pitch?,3
Okay. I'm no cricket guru but the difference between Iyer and Shaw was Iyer was watching the ball.,11
"Shaw's footwork needs serious fixing. Lad has the best resources around him, should make the most of em.",10
Looks like the moron who downvotes every comment is back again,10
Wow Dhawan is really in form! Fucking finally!,8
KL with that silent Bhenchod yell.,2
Off topic: Where can I find the song in KL's boAt ad?,3
"Shaw needs to ask punter give him pointers(heh) on short deliveries, also play a slow game if Dhawan is firing already.",1
KL is angry today,8
"M Ashwin's career eco is 7.86.  
If that isn't a sign from above, I dont know what is ha!",6
Does Rahul talk in Tamil to M Ashwin?,3
Delhi at the top without single truly explosive innings from Pant or Hetmeyer. Mumbai near the top without Hardik bowling or even being in the best of form. Shows the depth of these two sides.,3
"Is brian fooling around ?
Get the feeling he is legit annoyed by swannie nowadays",6
Why is everyone batting for Jordan he's not any good himself. Only didn't give 15 runs in super over because of Mayank's brilliance,5
We talk how Kohli and Dhoni have been performing from very first edition of IPL. Same with Dhawan I remember him making back to back 40 or 50 playing for Daredevils in 2008,9
Gotta get Shikhar at any rate,2
Shikha be like : BCCI = ICC. IPL = ICC Premier League,4
No look six is due any minute now,3
Biggest mistake by kxip was to open the bowling with an Australian bowler against Dhawan,10
Ponting probably not the best batting coach if he can't bring Rahane back to his t20 form,4
Think everyone including Lara has had enough of Swann's bs,-1
"Indian Team for T20

1) Rohit
2) Dhawan
3) Kohli
4) Iyer
5) Rahul
6) Pandya

"His job is to make the most of the powerplay, not to statpad to a 45 ball 50, you old geezer.",5
Dhawan seems like one of the few Indian flexible enough to compete with East European gymnasts,5
I want KXIP to win because it would be beneficial for us,10
"Shock and surprise, Gavaskar hates a player who tries to accelerate early",21
Sunny G with some really good critiques on Shaw.,12

But sometimes he overdoes it. Just talk about the game sometimes too.",15
Oh they didn’t drop Maxi thank god.,10
Unacademy has got to be the stupidest name for a learning platform. It sounds like a place where they teach you how to be dumb.,78
M Ashwin isnt gonna bowl a full length delivery to Iyer lol.,13

Just now saw the score ffs drop Prithvi Shah,1
the rise of the Kiwi bowlers - Neesh and Lockie.,8

Swann has literally driven me to a point where I'd rather listen to Danny Morisson instead,-5
That question was ask the expert so why is Anjum Chopra replying?,8
Why is Nortje not playing today? Rested?,0
Is it only me or Neesh n Lockie look pretty similar,-1
Shikhar making his 5000th run EASILY today,2
Seems like dhawan gonna get that orange cap by the end of season,10

Wow Jimmy Neesham AND Rishab Pant in the same game ! Look forward to miserable failures so I can make fun of r/Cricket,7
Who's gonna open for India out of Dhawan Kl and Rohit now?,-1
Nokia not playing today?,3
At this rate it's going to be more difficult to get a post prime Dhawan out of the team than it was to get Dhoni out.,3

Which Indian player would you like to steal away from another franchise for your team in next Mega Auction? Realistically.,1
I don't want to see Indian selectors picking Dhawan instead of Rahul for opening in the next T20 series due to IPL. Seriously... He's ranked no. 2,2
"For the love of god, let Bishnoi bowl. He is our best bowler",9

Can Maxwell at least try spinning the ball instead of bowling that trash arm ball.,5
[deleted],-3
"Holy shit gabbar we get it, you fuck",6
We have a lot of batsmen who are an absolute joy to watch.,3
Poor Shadab Jakati has to watch his worst moment on a cricket field after every over. And Bumrah was triggered by a Jaipur police billboard lol.,3
I have never seen Dhawan playing this aggressively,5
Maxwell you fucking moron. Can we do a justin bertha from hangover with him? Just shove him and a matress onto the roof of his hotel,1
Petition to call it Umbrella shot,3
Why have kxip persisted with maxwell???,1
The fuck did i take Prithvi in my fantasy team and excluded Dhawan. F for me bois.,4

Maxwell : NOOOO!! GOD NO!!",3

Maxwell is just giving reasons not to play him",3

Now he's barely a batsman and sprays it around as a bowler.  
At least, Afridi was consistently threatening as a bowler",6

That shot reminded me of Tendulkar,0

Is there an advantage of bowling an off spinner to the left handers ?. Looks like bishnoy is not gonna get his 4 overs..why play a specialist leg spinner if you are not gonna use him ?,2
"What is the bowler's equivalent to pinch hitter..

When is this part time bowling experiment with Maxwell ending?? 

If u need a part timer, give it to UNIVERSE BOSS",1
Why dont I see aggression in Rahul's batting even though he's hitting boundaries,2
Bishnoi and mujeeb are the same person imo,8
Pant really has worked on his offside game.,6
Pant vs KL vs Dhawan,4
"Dhawan has been in red hot form. Good headache for India to have in T20is. Rohit, KL, Dhawan and Mayank all competing for the openers slot.",9

Pooran after that marvelous Fielding has been poor in field consistently,4
"So pant has already overtaken samson


Huh, who would've thought",5
"Bishnoi has been so impressive this year. Very composed and looks so mature. Watching him, it is hard to believe this is first season. Doesn't get enough mention as the other youngsters at all.",5
What happened to Shaw? He's having an awful IPL,1
Why is bishnoi called a leg spinner,1
"Punjab aren’t even utilizing Bishnoi, trade to CSK pls. Poor guy doesn’t even get 4 overs",0
Today KL Rahul sounds like a parent telling their toddlers to do things,2
"Last time Delhi were this good, they were trashed by Gilchrist in the SFs. Good thing that top 2 teams get a second chance now.",7
Strangely Pooran has been quite bad at field today,3
"hope we have a 200 runs+ finish today,been a while.",2
Let neesham bowl 4 overs not maxwell.,1
Damn Dhawan's in form DC is so OP,5
Has pant gained a lot of weight?,10
I don't understand the reason behind bringing Bishnoi after 9th/10th over every game.,8
Bishnoi has such a Gully cricket bowling action.,4
Someone give Prithvi his lean before next match ffs he’s been horrible.,2
discount dhawan on zoom audience,3
"What the fuck did SunnyG smoke before coming to commentary today, blabbering some shit.",1
How does Rishab do a kip-up with that बैल like physique ?,1
Shikhar's form for DC might well prove to be clutch in the play-offs.,5

Anyone notice that since Maxwell changed his stance he has been shit.,3
Finally some good commentary,1
Prithvi and Juice Wrld look similar-ish. Or am i just not very sharp in the ed.,1

Why Maxwell again?,3
Kohli's 2016 season year on year looks to be too big a target.,9
I can't remember a time Gavaskar wasn't speaking,1
Bhosdike Maxwell,3
DC is doing the right thing,1
"Maxwell can't take wickets, can't hit well. What is he in for? Why did Punjab waste a foreign spot on him?",5
Fun Fact around 2016 Mayank got overweight and thought of turning it around and got fit made loads of runs in domestic now he's doing really well. On the other hand you have Pant. Kids be like Pant Letsssss Zoppppp❤️,0
Dugout 😂,5
Kl what are you doing? Another over for maxi 😒,1
What the fuck is happening in the Dugout?,8
I just remembered that Dhawan used to play for MI for a couple of seasons.,5
Maxi better make up this shit bowling with his... haha,2
With pointing in the coaching squad it'll be criminal if Shaw doesn't improve on his short deliveries,1
If Pant doesn’t work on his fitness then his WK career will be short lived marred with injuries. If he only plans to become a specialist batsman then it’s not an issue but his outfielding skills will be at par with Chawla soon,3
"Finally, Delhi has seen through the trick Punjab is playing by convincing everyone Maxwell is a world-class spinner who goes at 6 RPO",1
Hahahahhahaa Sanjay and Swann 🤣,4
ALLLTTRRROOOZZZZZZ!,7
"I thought it was gonna be a no ball, turned out to be the fucking Altroz",5
nooo rahul neesham and maxi have already combined for four!!! you don't have to keep bowling them!!! let ashwin and bishnoi bowl together pleaseee,3
Dugout is always fun when the Altroz is shown,8
Dhawan out or six this over,5
"Pant needs to go big, our batting is pretty deep",3
Dugout going insane over the Altroz,6
Dugout commentators fighting over Altroz lol,9
"“Very stylish just like the men along side me.” Rather weird comment to make Karthik.


Just to clarify: weird in a cricketing context talking about a car and comparing it to the men along with him",3
Thought somebody had  a heart attack on dugout,4
"Dhawan's getting another 100 today, isn't he?",4
Is it me or Maxxi looks sexy?,1
Hit a four it’s just Maxwell.,3
Dugout on crack,9
"Tata be like, this is the best advertisement money we have ever spent.",8
Swann is an absolute blast. Bangar's insight as a coach is quite good too.,6
"Jadhav's uselessness has reached Maxwell in ipl, bowling action is also getting affected",2
KL gives off Dad vibes when he says GET IT YOURSELF,5
Pant hit that into the blackhole,3
Sanjay bangar will be boring even if swann inject steriods in him. I mean who doesn't get all pumped up on looking at THE BEAUTY altroz,2
Only reason Maxi is bowling is KLR knows that he has taken Dhawan’s wicket twice in IPL. Barely any solid reason,3
Bruh pant take a single,3
Lmao what was that shot by pant,3
4 runs in a maxwell over is an ABSOLUTE win imo,6
Sunny ji with his dad jokes,2
Predictions for Maxwell's innings today? Redemption time or not?,1
Coco Cola marketing team in India makes the most shittiest ads. Globally they are known to make so many memorable ads.,3
"I don't have dugout, what's going on?? Real FOMO here",3
These two probably have the worst balance among current Indian batsmen. Pant loses his shape every ball lol. Shows you don't have to play pretty to be successful.,3
"Anyone rooting for back to back 100 for Dhawan??  First time in ipl

Have only seen KP achieve that feat in CPL for t20s",5
How does Pant pass yo-yo tests?,3
Maxi sliding in cheap overs 👌👌👌,3
"Last 3 matches

Shaw - Avg 2.33 - SR 50

"KL 500+ runs.
Shikha 400+ runs.
Umm Rohit, where are you?",5
Dhawan has been carrying DC batting last few matches,2
Good over from specialist bowler Maxwell,2
Hooda looks like a good villain,8
"Lmao they showed meme making fun of commentators

Good sport",8
From Ghislaine to Glenn... Not a good year for Maxwells.,14
There are some REALLY punchable faces in REALLY frustrating ads this season.,6
Lmao bishnoi appealing for that,4
Dhoni and kJ should watch and learn from the one.,1
Gabbar is such a boss man. So nice to watch when hes smashing it like this,3
Is it correct to assume that IPL players have no rights in picking or preferring teams and have to accept auction results ?,6
Finally,4
Dont know why Maxwell changed his stance he was so good with the old one.,1
"So Altroz is actually a good car right? 

In the market for a car in that segment",7
Get a fielder there KL.,3
What if there's no Rohit in the next T20 WC lol,13
I love when players actually progress and get better from match to match. Beauty by Shikhar,3
Next over for M Ashwin or Maxi?,2
Why do the cricket gods just hate me man,2
"As a neutral fan, wud love to see DC getting 180 190 here..

Then scenes of Rahul-Mayank pair going hard against Rabada in pp shud be amazing",6
Man he is in sex form but his sweeps give me anxiety,6
"people be criticizing me for losing balance while trying sweeps, now I do be losing shape everytime I touch the ball",5
"Swann : you feel like my wife.
Scotty : I hope not . This is hilarious.",11
Dhawan with an amazing shot,7
Gabbar will have to pee in a cup today. What is he on?,5
Does Bishnoi not realise it can't be lbw if it's pitched a mile outside leg,6
Is Leg spinners to left handers a bad idea?,6
5k for Gabbar,5
Okay Russell and maxi came in as batting all rounders and became bowling all rounders. Nice.,5
4th batsman to get 5k ipl runs?,5
The battle between Dhawan and Rahul for the second opening spot for India is so good to see.,10
Scooter Pant,8
CSK will pick up Dhawan next auction,4
Another 100 dhawan please,9
I am slowly becoming a Dhawan fan,6
Won't lie In form Dhawan can single handedly take us into semis of next year T20 WC.,7
"Dhawan has been absolutely brilliant over the last few games

Loving this run of form",5
"Rahul, Dhawan, Kohli are in the top 5 run scorers list, is Rohit out of form?",2
Good call from Pant to deny the second run,3
When's the last time we scored 200+? Wasn't it like the 3rd match?,2
Time for Panty boy to tonk a few..,1
I'm smelling another century from TheOne.,3
Pant there helping down his brother Maxwell feel good. Nohomo,3
Brainless captaincy again,2
What is with the half ass feilding ?,3
Gabbar ain't leaving the T20 opening slot anytime soon.,8
Dhawan's carried DC's batting in the last 3-4 matches damn. And his SR has been brilliant.,5
Pant channelling his inner thala,7
"I used to have a friend, he will buy boomer for 1 rupees and will chew it for 3-4 hours even though boomer lost its essence in first 10mins itself. He will take every bit out of the boomer to make sure the 1 rupee is spent well. 

Boomer is Maxwell

Freind is KXIP",15
Can 2 wickets hurry up and fall so I can see hulk burst out of his shirt,4
Man Pant is struggling,2
5000 IPL rules for Dhawan are more impressive considering how much he has been memed last few years.,5
"Panty feeling fidgety, ngl",2
Rishabh Pant should be next inductee to get a full bright scholarship at tuktuk academy.,5
"I mean, Pant's connection right from match 1 was dodgy, although he was getting runs, now it looks like he's lost that 10% timing as well. Jeeeeeeeez he's struggling.",3
Down with WhiteHat Jr - predatory fucks,9
Can pant not run or something?,3
Pant struggled against Bishnoi in their first meeting as well.  Not picking him well may be.,2
"Dhawan thinks he's playing the T20 world cup right now innit

ICC Dhawan always turns up",6
Did something happen to Dhawan after that innings against Mumbai?,4
Rohit as backup opener in t20??????,2
Anyone watching that white hat jr ad with the fighting investors? Doesn't the kid resemble the neighbour more than the lady's husband? 🤣,8
"When Pant isn't hitting the ball well. He still runs down the pitch for singles and all.  
Samson is so much more, all or nothing. Either his shot reaches the pavilion or he reaches the pavilion. No in-between",4
Pant is going from Gilchrist to Dhoni,7
Back to back 100 incoming,6
"What's the T20 ratio for how many overs should be required to make half the runs?

In ODIs, it's 30:20

edit: personally think it's 13:7",2
"Panty was struggling before getting injured too. Probably the only weakness in this strong DC side, Pant not making runs.",6
Did Dhawan get a time warp to 2013,6
"so Pant is the anchor in this partnership i guess? He should hit freely. We still have Hetmyer, Stoinis, and Axar",7
"Just a reminder, We got Dhawan in exchange for Shankar and Nadeem",9
"Styris: I tune out whenever you start talking.

Swanny: Yeah it feels like I'm talking to my wife sometimes.

Styris: FEEL like your wife, I hope not!?

These poor commentators have been together in the bubble for too long...",10
Brilliant from dugout,4
Im anti censorship but these josh ads need to be banned,23
Just checked that dhawan has 350+ runs every season since 2014 man's a bank,10
Do any of y'all use whatever new cloned versions of Tiktok which are getting advertised? Just curious. I've never used Tiktok so it doesn't matter but there are so many ads on these new unheard short video platforms..,6
"[this video explains why Maxwell is in the team, it's pretty short](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)",8
Pant has ensured there were no wickets which is good enough at this stage to be honest. He just needs to carry on now!,7
I hope the absolute nerds who kept on insisting Pant needs to play sensibly and stop getting out by (gasp!) hitting the ball in the air are satisfied when he completes his transformation in to a run a ball merchant a la current day Kohli. I'm sure the sensible strike rotation (TM) must be great to watch.,-3
"Dhawan is using Ponting's kookaburra with the springs in it, its the only explanation for his resurgence.",12

Sad man,1
Why Pant why must you hurt me this way,3
Seeing Dhawan bat like this really makes me hope Warner has a late season resurgence. The numbers do not express how much he’s been struggling. Even in the last game the few boundaries he hit against Russell were all edges even though Russell was bowling absolute pies.,7
Pant needs to get fit ngl.,3
Boomer still has some essense left in it,2
Specialist bowler Glenn Maxwell,5
Scott Styris so good,3

Dhawan : Maa chudaye teri googly,10
"With Gayle getting better match by Match , KL and Mayank to Open. Then Pooran hitting sixes at 4, and Jimmy Neesham in as well. Delhi will lose if they don't get to 190",0
Dhawan isnt going anywhere today lol,3
Bruh Dhawan such form much wow,3
Is dhawan the only Indian player who plays sweep shot?,1
"Swanny: This tournament is rigged.

Everyone else: Bold strategy, let's see if it pays off for him...",2
Swann is only right 10% of the time talking about cricket lmao Dugout.,4
"Btw Sanga called Stoinis all muscles, no timing. Just in case it slipped under the radar. I agree ofc.",5
Don't think it matters how much we get if we struggle to get Mayank and KL both.,0
If it's leg-spin why don't they go round the wicket for Dhawan?,1
Shikhar PLEASE no reverse sweeps to stupidly throw your wicket,5
TheOne is toying with the bowling. Love when he’s in form.,6
Anjum- Need to keep away with that bat                                                     Bowlers- Oh shit why didnt we think of that,5
"0/28
0/24
1/31

Against the Top 3 sides in the competition. Everyone bashing Maxwell conveniently ignore how valuable his cheap spells have been. All these games have been 170+ par score matches btw. Of course he was picked in the side as a batsman, but why would you not pick ANY bowler who is going to give you 4 overs every match at under 8 RPO? Add to that he's also a gun fielder.",10
"Dhawan is so fit, he looks same as he did 10 years ago",23
punjab will be happy with anything under 190 from here,7
Gabbar back to back 100s today?,9
"Csk player in super striker, lol.",10
Punjab would’ve been much higher up the table if Gayle hadn’t been benched first few matches.,4
Someone's been slapping his thighs just right recently,6
Why is Stoinis playing full length on the backfoot?,6
Ok now its getting annoying from dugout,1
Anyone scored 2 consecutive centuries in IPL or rather T20? Maybe Gayle did it?,2
Need 180+,1
What’s with KL and his perennially drooping shoulders?,8
"As much as I want DC to win this year, want Punjab to win today for the league table",2
Has anyone hit back to back 100s in the IPL yet?,6
Would be fun to see 2 wickets in succession rn. Hetty needs a bit of time too,3
Pant has a test hundred in Australia and test series win in Australia. He is already worth the hype for me!,5
"Pooran's not good the best arm in the field eh? 😂

That extra 4 unneeded overthrow vs MI

This throw rn that idk where it went really

Still, got the run out when we needed it",2
DC playing 2 bbl hits? They want to lose this match.,4
Oh man that 100 is on!,1
"Mumbai Simpians

Simpisthan Royals

Royal Simpengers Bangalore

Delhi Simpitals

Chennai Simper Kings

Simps XI Punjab

Simprisers Hyderabad

Kolkata Simpriders",5
that gap was smaller than a supermodel's thigh gap,5
"Shikhar ""Gap"" Dhawan",4
Maxwell is playing the Mujeeb role this year,4
"Do you realise, Punjab play SRH, KKR, RR and CSK after this. Still could have a outside chance.",9
"Wtf, how is Dhawan so flex now all of a sudden haha",7
"I am almost certain that a large portion of the people making fun of Pant for trying to get in and then go aerial also made fun of him for hitting a quick 20 or 30 and not going on. Literally the only thing some people will be satisfied with is if he gets 100 off 40 every innings and only gets out if someone bowls a 120mph inswinging yorker to him. Otherwise it's ""too aggressive"", ""too slow"", ""didn't play enough shots"", or ""got out playing recklessly"". 

The perfect three format batsman does not exist, and even if they did, it was never Pant. The sooner you realise that a middle order finisher with a high strike is very likely to be inconsistent and get out looking silly, the happier you will be.",6
"At this point, I would put every fielder at Dhawan's leg side",1
"Don't see Gayle scoring big today. Rabada and Nortje's pace is a BIG bridge to cross.  
Has to be a KL-Mayank-Pooran show to help them out",2
Back to back centuries coming,5
I’m glad Dhawan stopped this accumulator BS mentality. Beauty,7
Looking at 180+,4
Placement boi,3
Could have bowled shami here? To nick a wicket?,3
Bas kar bhai Dhawan 🙏,2
"All Dhawan's shots have been placed well, dare I jinx it",2
So we're settling for 180?,1
"What that's Jhonty Rhodes, looking completely different",3
I miss the old Pant.,3
"Hindsight is 2020 but if in the previous World Cup we had: 

Dhawan, Rohit, Kohli, Iyer,Rahul (wk), Pandya, Jadeja, Shami, Bumrah, Chahal, Kuldeep/Bhuvi

We might have had a chance.",3
Commentators still haven't caught up on the sponsors. It's Altroz super striker of the match guys. not that hard. Embrace the reality.,5
rahul stop shouting catch it after every slight flight,4
"Shikhar, time for another century?",3
Lmao kl shouting catch it after every hit,9
"I'm so used to see Jonty with MI, this feels so different",24
What Dhawan did CSK unleash ffs? Drop a man 4 times and this is his confidence level!!,16
[emperor dhonpatine](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/37461653/good-good-soon-your-transformation-to-the-dark-side-will-be-complete.jpg),1
T20 WC was originally scheduled to start last weekend. The very same weekend Dhawan gets into incredible form. Coincidence?,69
Jhonty looking daddy af.,18
Safe! Thank fuck,8
Oh shittt,3
drop for the century,4
"Dhawan

Luck: it's over 9000",2
The other guy should have been catching it,2
perfectly placed,2
You lucky lucky man!!,3
"Here we go, team started dropping Dhawan catches",5
3 more drops remaining,3
Sanga is a former KXIP captain ! Don't forget,6
Bkl iska to catch pakad lo,3
Whewww,4
"It's insane how age affects people differently. Shikhar and Uthappa are the same age, yet Dhawan is batting as well as ever, while Uthappa hasn't averaged over 20 in 2 seasons.",9
Jonty's lips look almost powdery white...,5
Dropped by KL,6
Indian management is going to screw over Pant and Samson. They are both going to end up playing tuk tuk bcz of the management's outdated ideas,5
"Aww man, Was Hooda's call",7
Prithvi Shaw needs to get the hairpiece that Jonty has,10
imagine being so shit you get out to Maxi,6
Poor fielding when jhonty is in interview lol,18
Dhawan has been really unselfish tho. 100 for the taking but he has the team as the priority. Good to see.,10
Fuck me that was an edge as well,8
Dhawan is anti-Manish Pandey. He finds gaps whereas Pandey just keeps hitting to the fielders,12
Maxwell has lost basic cricketing sense also. Please drop him ffs.,-2
"Dhawan dropped, 100 confirmed",5
I wish I had 1% of the luck Dhawan's having for the past couple of games,8
Lmao Dhawan has the gods on his side rn,9
"Whats with all this luck for Dhawan, keeps on giving",8
I hope KXIP stick to legspinners as long as Stoinis is there,4
That was Mayank's catch tbh,5
"Shikhar seems to be playing in a different match.  
Delhi is running on one engine throughout this game.  
Got to fire at both ends",5
Dhawan’s luck has been out of the world these last two games,13
"Jhonty comes on to talk, Kxip drops two catches. Coincidence?",23
Kl didn't know he was bowling googley lol,4
dhawan since last game : catch me if you can,10
Come on Gabbar. Try a reverse sweep. That’s the only way you’ll get out,5
"Which devil did Dhawan sign a contract with, to get this much luck the last few matches?",9
"If kL is injured, Punjab’s career is over",12
No catch by kl when it matters,3
Dhawan is the luckiest man this season,2
"KL dropped that, right? Two missed chances in one over, while Jonty Rhodes getting interviewed",6
"GOT : Valar morghulis

Dhawan : Not if they keep dropping me",3
KXIP should not blindly use the fast bowlers here and use the spinners who are doing well enough.,2
Its incredible on how soon Bishnoi became the first choice spinner for KXIP. That too with a couple of good spinners in the squad. Dude's the real deal.,6
How about Delhi open with pant and dhawan next game,4
Midfield just when fielding coach is on mic. Perfect.,4
People saying the catch was a drop have never played cricket in their life,11
Dhawan scored 64.8% of the runs of DC's innings with four overs to go.,6
So each of the hundreds in ipl is a result of dropped catches eh ?,4
"Rahul's not a very good keeper

Struggles against spin a lot especially, rarely picks the variation",1
Uh oh spinner in 17th over.,3
Did the commentators sense that something was going to happen that ball? Is it ICC=BCCI time yet?,2
Ooo thats a ballsy call. Spinner in 17th over.,4
Not a ringing endorsement for Jonty's coaching,3
Can we limit them to 170,4
"1. Shaw
2. Gill
3. Iyer
4. Pant
5. Riyan Parag
6. Priyam Garg
7. Shreyas Gopal
8. Arshdeep singh
9. Tyagi
10. Ravi Bishnoi
11. Saini.
Would love to see this team",0
How handsome is Jhonty and lovely too... but mostly handsome and mostly lovely too ..,2
Stoinis dried up after that 1 good match. Mi and DC's are not so perfect now.,6
"Is it true that Shikar wife is 12 years older than him ? If yes, more power to him. He broke Sachins record by more than 2x.",10
Back to Back centuries loading,3
Spinner in last 4. Interesting,5
"Since this is not a csk match thread, what do you guys think is the bigger crime?

Match fixing or murder?",14
"Thread full of Pant apologists. If thala or Samson played that kind of innings, they would be all over them. What has Pant even done post Aus test series ( 2 years ago) to justify the hype anyway?",2
DaOne,8
"IT HAS GONE OUT

Great commentary",7
Another hundred loading,5
Inb4 Dhawan scores four centuries this IPL,8
Gabbar for another century,3
"Rohit is looking class below KL, Dhawan and Mayank this year IPL",24
Is it just me or Hooda doesnt really give his 100% on the field?,6
Time for daddy Stoinis to flex some muscles..,10
"Catch drop by Maxwell during Jonty Rhodes interview, haha Jonty is fun guy",6
Don't want to jinx it but would love to see back to back 100s!,9
"Just keep Dhawan off strike, every other batsman for them is shitting the bed",8
So Rohit and Dhawan will remain Indian T20 openers,9
"What is Stoinis going to do here,",3
Werent these the same experts saying he is bad while playing the sweep shot?,5
Stoinis where the timing at bruh,5
"Marcus ""Bruce Banner"" Stoinis",10
Dhawan on his way to second century of his IPL career,9
Dhawan needs to be nerfed,5
"No one has batted well today other than Dhawan, surface tough to bat on?",3
is it gonna be dhawan's kohli 2016 year??,5
Could have just bowled Arse deep,5
What I love about this DC batting is how they’ve relied on lots of singles. Just the one boundary per over and many singles and the run rate is absolutely fine in the the middle overs,12
"Reminder that SRH traded Dhawan for Vijay Shankar, Shahbaz Nadeem and Abhishek Sharma",18
"Sanga, Jayawardene,Yuvraj, Irfan Pathan, Brett Lee, Sreesanth, Shaun Marsh.

KXIP were so good in 2008-2010",7
Sunny saying OUT OUT for a six is a bit unorthodox.,5
Dhawan to Indian selectors: try dropping me now you pricks,7
“Without worrying about getting lbw” won’t he just get bowled instead in this case though,4
Prepare to chase 170-180 KL and Mayank,10
Anyone understand why Hetmyer has been so underutilized? I get he hasn’t delivered when asked but he could’ve come in today instead of Stoinis.,7
"I don’t even mind Stoinis not hitting that much, he should just give Dhawan strike rn he’s playing like a god.",7
Is Dhawan playing exceptionally well or is everyone else is playing like shit,6
Dhawan's back must be in a really bad shape after single handedly carrying DC's batting in the last 2 matches.,46
Dhawan can even sweep a fast bowler. What a player of sweep.,5
So this what feels like to be a fan of a strong team.,19
Who bowls the other 2 death overs with Shami? Arshdeep?,5
Anureet my dude get some 🐔 tikkas in you man. Get beefed up,3
"Genuine doubt. If Dhawan has a very powerful legside game, isnt it wise for bowlers to make him play on the offside?",4
Dhawan might even overtake KL next match he plays depending on how KL plays this one.,11
"Kinda strange to say this as I bowl legspin in club cricket but I think there are too many wrist-spinners in this IPL and not enough orthodox finger spinners. Especially quality right arm offspin bowlers. Theres just Ashwin and Washington Sundar. 5 years ago, every squad used to have a couple of decent offspin options to choose from.",5
"Kohli, Jadeja, and Shikhar are some fit ass mf'ers. Need to get all of our players on their level",36
Has anyone ever scored back-to-back hundreds in IPL?,6
Please gawd let DaOne get himself a back to back century.,12
Dhawan's SR is 180 and combined SR of everyone else for DC is 90.,34
Dhawan just casually scoring 2/3rds of DC's runs,18
Dhawan may not get 973 but he has a good chance to equal most centuries in season record,8
Ashwin has bowled much better than his final figures suggest.,3
So the debate about wt20 team has settled then? Dhawan it is. KL at 5 like odis?,6
SRH should have given Dhawan extra 2 crores he was asking lol,79
"Are Delhi matches at cooler places or what.

Or Dhawan is fitter than everybody. Showed no signs of tiring in both the matches.",12
Gabbar is in god mode,4
Dhawan doesn't need water he needs a chiropractor for his back,7
Did Dhawan have a jersey change? His usual number is 23 right? Def don't remember him wearing 42.,2
Dhawan inventing a new role: pinch hitter who also stays till the end,8
Andrew CALVIN HARRIS Tye,2
"Dhawan 92 off 51

Rest of DC 43 off 51",13
Wow all bowlers have 7+ economy currently... Dhawan effect,1
Dhawan getting gifted centuries,1
Anything under 190 would be a good job by kings 11 based on how things stand right now,5
Who's gonna open for India with Rohit in Limited overs cricket?,7
Stoinis should go hell for leather now. They got two proper batsmen in the dugout,6
Fucking do something Stoinis,0
DC scorecard without Dhawan is utter shit,6
Shikhar Dhawan GOAT status,7
Play your best batsman at the top is actually an OP strategy in T20.,6
Rahul always looks like he's on the verge of tears,9
"When Dhawan first entered the Indian team, I thought he would be this tattooed thug that was bad tempered, getting into fights all the time, but he turned out to be one of the happiest, most easygoing guys lol. Or at least from what I've seen on field",12
Second innings Shami comes into attack,8
Idk why but I cringe so hard when the instagram reels ad comes up,8
"Imagine if Dhawan, Kohli, Rahul enters god mode in 2021 World Cup.",11
Shami's seam position is amazing on every single ball,5
Dhawan is going to ~~go~~step out because shami is bowling very accurate yorkers,1
"KL Rahul is one unluckiest dude when it comes to Orange Cap. Last 2 years, he could have won it had his team went to playoffs. Similar scenario this year if Dhawan plays like this",6
Shikhar looks like he's batting on a different pitch. Literally carrying the DC batting on his shoulders.,12
"Dhawan 92(51)

Other guys 44(52)",21
"Shikhar is officially at 2nd position in runs of this season, KL being on 1st",12
Feels like after switching to Kookaburra Bat you can see Dhawan being in much more control with his bat swing. Bat's weight do matter sometimes.,3
Shami's yorker game has been on point since that super over.,5
Dhawan is made to look like Matthew Hayden by these amateur teams,3
I thought csk played yesterday?,5
Shikhar is on daddy status,7
Shami crack those sticks please,9
We should've hit Maxwell for big runs when we had the chance,4
"Gabbar, ""kitne centuries thae?""

r/cricket- ""do thae sardar""",36
Yorker after yorker. That's what the fuck I've been talking about Shami!,10
Shami was India’s reliable death bowler in 2015 before Bumrah came onto the scene,8
Folks thinking it’s a good pitch based on Dhawan’s innings. He is in another zone lol.,5
"Oh no.
Anyways.....",4
"Why is it called par score? What does ""par"" mean?",2
The Stoinis of Australia is back?,2
Match Bot thinks Bishnoi bowls Right Arm Fast Medium :/,8
Consecutive centuries in T20 is not a normal feat. Gabbar is very close,10
Shami boi and his biryani power,4
"Not today, Stoinis",2
Shaminator is as good as Bumer and sometimes even better. 👌,6
BC getting out on full toss. Looks like a slightly below par score,5
Shami bhai 😍,5
StoiNO,6
Full toss is the new yorker these days,8
Stoinis wtf,2
Punjab surely winning this?!,1
DC's middle order exposed,5
Bishnoi should bowl the next over imo,3
Stoinis has started to suck,5
KXIP saved 15 runs there,8
This is kinda bad for dc..... One player carrying them is basically kxip 2019,9
That's the Stoinis Australian's know. Not a middle order bat.,8
Why the identical outs today for DC?,3
Stoinis is not a finisher. He should open instead of Shaw in my best Delhi team.,1
This could ve been such a low 1st innings score if Dhawan wasnt so fucking OP,8
Shami & Bumrah both bowl difficult full tosses,3
Nice one Stoin,3
Time for thicc boi Shimron,8
We now have 4 out of 6 top run scorers and 2 out of 3 top wicket takers this tournament playing this match,2
NO PLAYER HAS MADE BACK TO BACK 100 IN IPL EVER. But Warner has done it in T20..,3
Such an underwhelming end,3
Gane set for Hetti to do a Lord Tewatia,1
The full toss has been really fruitful this season,1
Delhi daredevils is back on the menu boys.,5
That's what first ball yorker does.,1
If Shami doesn't take Dhawan Arsh or Neesham are fucked next over,1
Don't expect 180 here.,1
No batsmen apart from Dhawan has looked comfortable on this pitch. Maybe 160 would be defendable,4
No Joke Preity Zinta hasn't looked this hot in all 13 Seasons of IPL  🔥,2
Damn that CAKE on hetmeyer,3
This was a really poor innings from big Stoin,2
"Once again, Full toss gets a wicket.",2
We want 6!,1
"Bring back the best AD #Kingfisher

&#x200B;

OO LA LA LE OO",8
Show ‘em what you’re made of Hetty.,3
"**17.3** Mohammed Shami to Stoinis, OUT, yorker gone wrong, but when you err you err on the full side. That is what has happened, and Stoinis who is looking to go deep into the crease is surprised as this full toss gets big on him. He gets a thick outside edge for a skier for Agarwal to catch after running to his right from cover **141-4**

MP Stoinis c Agarwal b Mohammed Shami 9 (10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 90.00",3
Need to step out,3
We need Axar,4
Other than Shikhar everyone has been totally shit today,3
Honey badger fireworks,4
Oh my God Shami when did you get this good?,5
Shami fuck me,5
Shami is high today... Fuck it,5
Shami is the new Bumrah.,6
Why would u bowl short against mi if u can nail those sexy Yorkers?,4
God of yorkers must have blessed Shami,9
"Shami's been nailing those yorkers

Did the same in that super over",10
So shami where were these Yorkers all along,6
Reminder: Kohli didn't play Shami in WC semifinal,13
Stoinis returning to form as the Australian summer nears,10
"With Bumrah and Shami going as they are, our fast bowling department looks set",6
No support for Dhawan today. Barely reaching 150 despite his effort,8
3 more,2
Why the fuck would you bowl that Shami?,9
"Stoinis fucks up :

People who are following him for long : ""that's our boy""",46
"DC released Shami in 2018. Ffs, the divorced couldn't have come quicker?",25
Simran Hetmyer is to play don't worry,12
Shikhar is literally carrying this team for the past few matches.,8
Of course Shami you had to do that lmao. Never change.,13
Damn what a shot,5
Shami seems the type of guy that Dhawan likes to hangout with.,18
"One gavaskar was bad enough, now we have two. Fucking 2020",13
Dhawan is the greatest cricketer to have ever played the game. CMV.,3
"Doesn't matter the team, love watching batsmen get a century in T20, come on Dhawan",5
Iyer's jelly when he doesnt score & others do,6
he's scored more than 2/3 of the total score,6
This is the time Jadhav usually comes to bat for us for a cute 5*(9),70
3 more till history is created,8
All DaOne haters real quite rn,6
"For a change, Gabbar saying ' Main aa raha hoon!'",8
"C’mon kxip, just 12 balls, please don’t be shit today in the death?",18
Crawl to 170 if you can lol.,4
Shami and Rabada have been a treat this IPL,4
Good over. Only 6 from it,2
And they said Shikhar was the only guy in DC who plays slowly,10
"Shami: Bowling yorkers and getting good results from them

Also, Shami: maybe i should bowl wide bouncers that the batsman can hit lmao",27
Gabbar to dc batting lineup: Welcome to your tape,11
The century had been under the pressure of a chase but this innings has been just as good.,3
"predicted score at 8 overs: 200

predicted score at 12 overs: 180

predicted score at 16 overs: 170

predicted score now: 160",11
"Shikar anna is IPL legend, fight me",6
Apart from Thighslap it's been a horrid batting performance.,3
I think DC is on its way to the lowest score with a hundred,3
"With one world class bowler like shami and a god batting line-up

How tf did u end up at last (atleast until recently)",0
Dismal batting performance by DC today.,4
"Kp record in danger of consecutive 100 in t20s

He did in CPL",1
"This is good for India if dhawan can carry on like this. With kl also playing really well the top order looks good. Kohli has been rotating strike so that atleast a good sign and bumrah and shami have been excellent

Now just need a middle order pair of Iyer and pant to step up incase we go 5/3 situations and even jadeja can play at 7 because he's been good with the bat",3
No one else getting the boundaries though except dhawan,3
Excited for the second innings of this match between KXIP and Shikhar Dhawan,5
Gabbar Vs Shami is a tasty battle. Both red hot.,8
Perfect yorker,2
Shami and Bumrah really giving me special feels,6
This is not the death bowling i was promised,9
God bless whoever bowls 19th,3
Arshdeep nailing yorker,3
IPL teams really need to stop buying top order overseas batsmen if they don't plan on batting them in the top order.,7
If at least one batsmen gave suport to Dhawan DC would be looking at a huge score.,3
They’re nailing these yorkers holy shit.,7
Punjab bowlers nailing those Yorkers. Good prospect,11
It's been an absolute shit show with the bat excluding Dhawan.,9
This guys are nailing yorkers,7
I dont think the pitch is difficult to bat on,2
Delhi “Left Handers” Capitals,2
"Dhavan: 97

rest of the team: 45",9
Imagine getting a shit 20 over score despite a batsman scoring a century.,10
Tbh Pooran's was more impressive,1
"After that 1 of 3 defeat punjab got fucked.

Can the dual super over victory raise their spirits and can they be the giant slayers this season.",3
Shikhar getting out now,0
KXIP is actually one of the better teams we have played this season. They deserve to be in the playoffs.,5
How do you even hit these yorkers!,1
Slower bouncers coming up,1
Pooran was more impressive than Mayank!,4
Very bold of dhawan to hit that and then run a late double,4
Now this is just receny bias Pooran save was much better,3
Damn dhawan would be the only player to do successive centuries in IPL. Awesome.,2
That was so close,1
"I don't about that one. Both amazing but I definitely prefer Pooran's save.

To each their own I suppose.",7
99 let's go DaOne. Let's goooooo,2
"Serious question 


Just turned on the game. 


Did Shikar get any drops in this game ?

Edit : Ah reddit thanks for the downvotes for a genuine question. But on a serious note thanks to everyone for the replies :))",0
Dhawan God,1
Dhawan saw Australia in CSK but what team did he see in KXIP?,5
"Shikha 100 Dhawan, that's his full name from now on.",2
Hetmeyer wouldve been out smh,2
Gabbar first man to get consecutive IPL 100s,7
"Take a bow Gabbar. You’re TheOne Delhi’s relied on and you’ve got back to back centuries now. IPL history, great stuff laddie.",11
These commentators wanna jinx everything. Glad he still reached it.,2
Yorker was a prostitute at the brothel and only the best cowboys got a chance to nail her. Only the best of the best nailed her frequently.,7
Brilliant stuff! Hats off sir!,1
Dhawan : Yes we've had a century but how about a second one?,7
First player to score back to back hundred in IPL,8
👏,3
Mighty achievement.,6
It seemed fucking impossible but he did it. Hats off.,6
"**THIGH SLAP** ANOTHER HUNDRED FOR DHAWAN 

100s scored in consecutive matches. Dhawan really getting in form at the best possible time for DC. Dhawan is the first player to score back to back 100s in IPL history.",5
dhawan - reverse sweep = immortal,3
Take a Bow man.,2
"Take a bow Shikhar, so fucking good",1
What's the lowest score with a centurion in T20s?,6
Bruh why do you change lengths when yorkers are working,1
Dhawan you absolute madlad,2
Mayank's save was better just because of the situation at the time.,3
Dhawan the run machine!!,3
"Brilliant knock from Dhawan again

Surprised that no one's scored consecutive hundreds in the IPL before this",6
OMG dhawan you animal,3
Boss Dhawan!!,3
"I wanna see Shikhar with full hair, he isn't even balding",6
Such an unselfish innings. He kept playing the way he had without going for the 100. Class act,4
Gabbar freaking legend!!,2
I mean imagine the people that criticised Dhawan at the top of the season lmao,7
Rest of the team: 49(52),12
"What  if you wanted to  


Show Intent  


But Kings XI said  


Yorker",10
Awesome,1
Well played Gabbar. Finally got to celebrate that 100,3
Shikhar Dhawan you beauty!,1
Dhawan always starts to lose his balance when he nears 100 lol.,2
Fucking hell dhawan. 100 off 57,3
"Doesn't get an IPL hundred his whole career, then gets 2 in a row!",15
Back to back 100s for Shikhar! You get one and then the floodgates open...,3
Fuck yes Shikhar,4
"Fuck back to back hundred!

Please take notes Prithvi Shaw.",8
Bc score runs now,2
Scenes when DC loses even after the Gabbar masterclass!,6
Shikhar Dhawan you absolute beauty,4
Fuck yes Gabbar,6
"Batsman to score back to back t20 100

Kp in cpl

Dhawan in ipl.. All hail Gabbar",5
I’ll say it again - we lost World Cup because of dhawan injury,10
My guy did his best to put up a reasonable total. Got no help tonight. Smh,6
What a player,5
"Without Dhawan, Delhi would have folded for below 150.  
Great performance",4
Now at least 20 needed off the last 8 balls,2
The thot increased the skin exposure after she wnet viral lol.,2
Still remember people commenting about dropping Dhawan from the Indian t20 side. He has surprised everyone,7
has anyone scored back to back 100 in ipl before?,1
"When Dhawan gets into form, he is always impressive to watch bat",4
"No offense, but I never thought of Dhawan as a batsman who can hit 2 hundreds in t20s let alone consecutives ones and with a healthy strike rate. Great Innings for the man !",28
Dhawan didn't get to celebrate his previous  100 in the field so he asked for a redo,25
"Well played Dhawan, now have to push for 170+",3
One man army.,3
"Rooting for Kings XI, but Dhawan with a nother special innings. Respect",6
He did it wow no support from the other batsmen of DC is gonna flop this show tho,4
He's tired af. Don't give him the strike now Hetti,8
Dhawan looking at rahul bitch even i can stat pad runs.,1
Sublime form Dhawan. Excellent!,2
"Gabbar is carrying this batting line-up in this match.

But don't think this score will be enough, unless they get 20 off last over.",3
How tf did all the bowlers go from conceding 15 rpo in the death to bowling pinpoint yorkers this ipl,3
Yes Hetty!!,4
"Gabbar man I love you, I'd never doubt your abilities ever again.",2
2 matches ago Dhawan didn't have a 100 in t20s. Now he's got 2. AMAZING!,2
KXIP death bowling is surprisingly good tonight. Was it the super over Shami needed to know he could bowl yorkers?,4
Finally someone except Gabbar took responsibility.,1
"Apparently Ayesha used to get angry and hound him when Shikhar didn't score.   


Seems like he's going to go back to K A L M wife now.",2
Yeah mah windies boy showing some windies flair.Lets go baby gayle,3
Gabbar finally showing in IPL the value he brings for team India,2
"r/cricket before- Dhawan is inconsistent af and plays ODI in T20s

meanwhile Dhawan- aaya karo ji kabhi sadi gali bhool ke vi aaya karo ji kabhi sadi gali bhool ke vi",3
"Dhawan

Kl/rohit

Kohli

Iyer/mayank/sky

Pant

Jadeja/axar

Chahal

Bumrah

Shami

Another seam bowler",1
Goddamn Gabbar you a real G.,2
178 would be tough to chase,1
DC will end around 180,1
23 in the last over plz,3
Hettyyy,3
Yaas hetty,2
Tfw when you realize Sikhar has scored 101 out of 150 DC has scored till now,9
"Gentle reminder that our top order for the series down under could potentially be:

1) Mayank Agarwal/Rohit Sharma

2) Dhawan

3) Kohli/Rahul

4) Rahul/Kohli

5) Dinesh Kartik

6) Jadeja

and we still have Prithvi Shaw, Iyer and Pant to fit in somewhere in there",8
"Excellent back to back hundred from Dhawan , he is carrying dc on his back for the last three matches, high time other batsman wake up and not bask on Dhawan's glory.",8
No.no.no arshdeep.,2
Crazy that it took a lad from Melbourne with a kookaburra to finally score back to back IPL 100's.,5
Great death over bowling by us.,2
Dhawan is pure class the way he maintained a strike rate of 170+ over 100 runs scored without wildly slogging at the balls and hoping for the best,7
"Carey crying in a corner

He would atleast taken 10 2s in Dubai and played a 20(10) cameo",4
Bc dhawan give strike to hetti first ball. Please. We need a 15+ run over. V underpar score here.,7
"Has anyone scored back to back hundred in T20s

Other than Dhawan",5
"If your opener is 102*(58) batting first, the least you'd expect to score is 180-185ish. 

The Pant + Stoinis innings scoring a combined 23(30) with a ton of wickets in hand was really poor cricket. 

Also, Shikka.DaOne is not only a clutch player he seems like a really likeable bloke. Love that guy!",54
Dhawan is literally better than the whole CSK franchise,6
I don’t wanna be Kohli now. Who will he choose as the openers in t20is ???,5
Looking forward to seeing another ton from KLPD. That'd be good.,3
Hetmyer should come in at 4. Great batsmen.,4
Shimron's 6s also look thicc af,3
I can imagine 3 consecutive centuries. ୧( ˵ ° ~ ° ˵ )୨,8
"Arshdeep, Krishna and Natarajan. Can’t believe that India have young seamers who can bowl decently at the death.",2
Why do we waste Hetmyer at the end? He takes less balls to get started than Stoinis but he always sent after him?,8
Remember Dhawan getting slagged off after his fifty a few matches ago. Glad that it was just a springboard for him to such a huge achievement. Brilliant turnaround from him.,3
"That's why bowlers avoid yorkers 
 
Ruined the over because he missed by few inches",3
Hetmyer is thicc,1
"**Batsmen with most 100s in an #IPL season**

4 - Virat Kohli (2016) RCB

2 - Chris Gayle (2011) RCB

2 - Hashim Amla (2017) KXIP

2 - Shane Watson (2018) CSK

2 - Shikhar Dhawan (2020) DC

Also, Shikhar is the first batsman to hit back 2 back 100s in IPL",3
"Dhawan - 102*
Rest of DC - 55

He just carried the entire team on his fuckin shoulders",8
I mean they batted really well all throughout and just kinda lost the way in the death?,2
That is a very good question Karthik,2
"Who's gonna open for us in T20I's? Gabbar, Brohit and KLPD are all in incredible form",3
Shaminator was good last year too.,2
Its WILD to think that of the 157 Dhawan has done 101 of those so far..,2
"Even when he was on 99, he was trying to play an attacking shot..",7
step out king,1
dHawAn shOulD mOve to CSK hE is ToO oLd,5
Damn Hetty's got a thicc ass,12
Shikhar Dhawan has shown great maturity for someone who doesn't even understand the meaning of One Tip One Hand.,24
My favourite current Indian cricketer. Always seems to play with a smile. Two great innings.,5
Dhawan doesn't care much for yorkers,3
"I feel like Dominic Cork just picks up one or two points whatever the other commentators said and repeats them in his own language a bit like a kid cheating on an exam... might be inexperience, maybe but also a lack of research / hard work on his part..

Edit: Not when making points about bowling though.",1
This is some crazy good late career turnaround from Dhawan here.,7
looks like Dhawan has found that magic bat from Chain kuli ki Main kuli.. 😂😂 De chauka De chakka..,11
Dhawan has hit a very good century. The score though isn't good. :/,3
"I think this game is bigger than the game tomorrow (RCB vs KKR), mainly because the game today is the top ranked team vs. the team that's been taking down other top ranked teams all of last week.",2
Lol why does Shaw look high as a kite all the time,6
Hetmyer has a better ass than my gf,25
Very poor final score when one man has hit 100 at a phenomenal strike rate,8
Cmon 170,2
[deleted],-23
Excellent Dhawan!,2
"Man, these West Indian players have some juicy asses damn.  
\#NoHomo",5
Holy shit Hetmyer has a huuggee Butt,3
Punjab is bowling really well in death overs,6
Dhawan looks to be so fit! Running all these doubles with ease.,8
"Gabbar, ""kitne centuries thae?""

Normies- ""do thae sardar""",10
"DC still 160 with dhawan scoring a century lol, wut...",11
Shikha is saving DC's ass.,8
Shikhar is easily the best Australian player in the IPL,49
This pitch must be really bad if DD doesn’t even make 180 here against KXIP bowlers. /s,5
Gabbar going 'tera kya hoga KaaLia'?,3
Is Sams a bowler?,1
This makes me remember the time when Tendulkar scored a 60 ball century or something similar. And MI went on to lose to Kochi Tuskers of all teams.,6
Nice shami. Got the fielder back to hint i am going to bowl a bouncer and then bowls a yorker.👌,3
170 won't be enough,7
"Without Dhawan, DC have scored 55 runs in 56 balls, and that includies any extras. If one batsmen scores a hundred in about 60ish balls, then the team score should really be around 200, and not 160",33
Why isn’t Nokia playing? Rested? Our score is shit and bowling attack toothless without him.,7
Shami is bowling terrific.,9
Wow gavaskar such great critical reasoning,3
"Me to my dad: *How did Pant get out?*

Dad: *Take a guess and it'll be right.*",4
Why didnt Mayank hit???,2
Final over where we are not being tonked. What is this reality?,3
Why didn't he go for the run out opportunity?,3
This is brilliant death bowling,2
What is the lowest t20 score with a hundred then?,2
Great over by Shami,2
Damn u guys 🥵 for that Hetty ass,5
"Dhawan 105 in 60 balls.

Rest of DC 56 runs in 57 balls.",7
Waiting for the trademark short ball,2
Consecutive hundreds but he still can't reverse sweep lmao,7
Super Shami is back boys !,4
"Punjab is going to win this because if Delhi wins, they will have a repeat MotM winner and we can't have that.",3
When did shami become such a brilliant death bowler?,1
Great death bowling by Shammi. He has bowled more yorkers than Bumrah has been bowling,1
Doull is a shithouse commentator. Talk about cricket you idiot,3
Kxip having a good set of death overs in bowling is legit ASMR for the fans,4
Lol,3
KL needs to learn that this is how you anchor the innings even if others don’t perform as well.,3
Damn man hetmyer's ass gonna make me act up. Gonna make do something I might regret.,5
Wtf lmao,2
Godly stuff from Shami!,3
Bruh excellent bowling. 😳,3
"Shikar : 105 from 60 balls

Everyone else including extras : 55 runs from 56 balls

How in the world is that even possible damn.",6
"Mr. KL , please take note. This is how you pace a T20 innings as an opener.",0
hit a six here hetty take it to 170,2
"Selfless of Dhawan to continue batting exactly like he did before he scored his century, he’s not throwing his wicket at all",7
Cmon 6,2
which of the two hundreds was more gorgeous to watch?,3
What is with shami’s yorkers man,10
 circus music intensifies,3
"Whoever is analysing the Delhi innings:

Dhawan scored 106 in 61 balls, wtf is the rest of the team doing lol.",11
Man that super over really changed Shami.,14
Wtf shami wow,7
Shami DAMN son,7
Fucking hell poison last over💀,7
Great death bowling,7
Last over was sexy af,2
Damnnnn!!! What an over from shami.... Infact what A spell by shami!!!!,3
"Dhawan played full 20 overs against CSK and today* too...but in both matches he didn't look tired like other players do.. leaning, gasping and all",12
"The ICC t20 world cup was supposed to be on around now, looks like dhawan is still in that timeline.",11
Move along Boom. Shamo is the new yorker king,3
Oh my Shami. That was a brilliant death over.,5
Fucking fantastic death bowling.,5
"Shami : Look at me. I'm the Bumrah now.
What a gem Shami. What a gem.",24
What an insightful discussion about jersey numbers. Sunny paaji and friends chakna leke baithe hain.,6
Lara is by far the best analytical commentator I've ever heard.. except for Stuart Broad when he did a stint in the Aus v Eng matches recently.,3
"The god of yorkers has blessed us today.

Shami 💪",9
Shami>Bumrah,-1
DC ending up with 165 after Dhawan scores 105 in 60 is actually terrible,7
KXIP will be happy with that score.,1
Shami nailed those fucking yorkers I’m not even mad.,6
Shami you beauty!!,3
Shami you’re a God.,5
KXIP : death bowling specialists,9
Delhi only scored 81 off their last 10 overs. Unbelievable effort.,2
So good to see kumble making use of Shamis death over skills. Definite improvement from last few games especially that super over,2
Shami be like.. Bumrah who?,4
"Dhawan 106*(61)

Rest of DC 58(59)",5
It’s alright we’ll defend this,2
What an over lol. We pulled them back pretty hard but still a good total to chase.,3
10 runs below par,2
"Shami, the power of briyani is really crazy man",4
Top notch death bowling.,3
What a treat that was. Shami and Gabbar stealing the show!,6
Wow that over from shami too good,3
"Shami to be pressured to bowl 24 yorkers a match, every match, starting tomorrow!",4
CSK unleashed the beast to take on its sworn enemy in the final. all according to plan. mahsterstroke,5
"Dhawan : 106 (61)

Rest of DC : 54 (59)

Extras : 4",9
"Lol bruh, Dhawan with the hard carry",2
Sub par score but can't count DC out considering their bowling and KXIP chasing record lol,3
"Shami was right on the money in last over, hope he keeps the form in India matches. Well done bhai.",3
"Hetty needs to face more balls! Send him before Stoinis, come on.",5
"**19.6** Mohammed Shami to Hetmyer, OUT,  **164-5**

SO Hetmyer  b Mohammed Shami 10 (6b 0x4 1x6) SR: 166.66",2
This reminds of the Viru hundred against Kochi on a minefield at Kotla. No one else scored then too.,2
I’m glad Shami has gained confidence in his death bowling skills after that super over. Extremely well done to restrict them to a score below 170,3
"Well played Gabbar again.. brilliant..
15 short cos of lack of support by others. 
Excellent death bowling by Shami..",4
"Before this ball Dhawan's run percentage as a part of team's total was 65.4%. Currently it's 64.6.

Without that Hetmyer six and if Dhawan had gotten a couple of big sixes, he would have broken Bannerman's record.",3
Last over by Shami was excellent,3
What a well mannered guy omg how is he Virat’s best friend,1
"Dhawan : 106*(61)
Rest of DC : 58(59)",4
No Nortje Advantage Punjab,1
Fuck imagine this Shami and Bumrah at death for us,9
"After that super overs, Shami is a changed man.

No more short stuff or slower balls, yorker after yorker after yorker.",6
"With that good an innings from Dhawan, this score is pathetic. Others not even scored at 6.",3
Let Hatmeyar do his job and Rishabh pant his job,3
What a last over from Shami!,2
"Friendship ended with Bumrah

Shami is now the Yorker man.",6
That over and that last ball was just amazing.,2
"Shami has become a yorker factory in the past 2 games.  
Good signs for India if he can replicate it on the intl level",3
DC really shat the bat given they had almost 60 in the first 6 overs with 1 down.,5
It's crazy that even after that 100 still DC didn't even reach 170. Pant should have been aggressive against Bishnoi. They still had Axar/ Daniel who can bat,7
Meh below par score,3
"Dhawan: 106(61)

Rest of DC : 58(59)",4
"India should just pick the team with the nicest smiles. Imagine Dhawan and Mayank opening together, the happiest opening partnership in cricket",5
Looks like a similar innings when pant scored 130 odd runs. Team score was 180 and srh won with 9 wickets remaining.,2
"KXIP batting order should be - Mayank, Gayle/Rahul, Rahul/Gayle, Pooran, Neesham, Hooda, Bishnoi, Shami, Ashwin, Arsh, Maxi",5
This isn't a great score though. Dhawan's exploits aside the other 60 balls were just 58 runs,3
"Dhawan actually scored 2/3rds of the runs

Wow",2
"The rest of the batsmen should hang their heads in shame, how shite were they???",6
Shami is flying high on the Super Over. Yorker after Yorker. Jeez.,6
"106(61)
58(59)",3
"Finally  


First Innings Shami",3
Beautiful death bowling by Shami.,1
"DC is my name
Having cocky fans after 2 good seasons is my game",5
"Without Dhawan's century, Delhi hasn't made much runs. Not a good score when someone in your team has a century.",5
"Dhawan - 106 off 61

Others (excluding extras) - 54 off 59

Barring Dhawan, woeful batting",12
Inspite of Dhawan's century 165 is gettable if punjab can keep their wits about,6
DC batting was so shit one batsman scored century still couldn't score 170,5
Shami man where was this all season?,21
We usually think atleast 50 runs for kxip in last 3 overs. But we conceded just 25. Wow.,9
Shite score,5
"With no Ishant, Shami needs to be at his best just like Today on Aus tour. No more 2nd innings Shami will need all match Shami 24*7 this time❤️",6
"Delhi's post match briefing: using a bar chart to graph the rub contributions. Dhawan, extras, all the other useless cunts 😂",4
Shami being a gentleman congratulating Dhawan there,7
What a mediocre total when there's a player with a century.,3
"I think Shami being expensive in the death previous is due to his mindset of changing things up and not his ability. His ability to bowl the yorkers, as seen in the last two matches is genuinely second to none.",7
I just saw the big bald spot on shikar's head. Probably why he is always keeping the bald haircut.,6
"Shami, Boomrah, Bhuvi (hopefully gets fit) is god tier pace attack.",8
"Because of Dhawan’s innings, we don’t know if he was brilliant or rest were shit. 

Actually my guess is both are true.",9
165 doesn't seem bad....WAIT....THEY DONT HAVE NORTJE TODAY....but still I think it's a good score to defend.,9
"Dhawan: 106(61)

Rest: 58(59)",13
Call out yo arshdeep who bowled an excellent over too.,5
"Shami: Look at me, I am the Bumrah now",7
"Don’t worry DC fans, just gear up for the super over",6
We traded Dhawan and got Vijay Shankar ;_;,12
Waiting for kings to fuck up,1
"What rubbish fielding. Overthrows should not be added to the bowler's figures. Shami though, those yorkers were really good.",6
Somebody forgot to tell the other batsman that you were supposed to score with Dhawan too and not just admire his batting from the other end.,3
[deleted],7
Shami you absolute beauty,6
"Dhawan batted like a god, but boy that was a piss poor effort from the rest of the DC batsmen. I'll exclude Hetmyer because he only got 6 balls to face, but honestly it was CSK level of batting from the rest.",8
"Holy shit.. Shami just leveled up and unlocked a new skill : Death Bowling, after a boss fight with Mumbai.",11
Excellent bowling from Shami,6
"Dhawan 106*(61)
Others 54(59)
Extras 4",0
"Punjab bowled really well. I think they can go on and win this easily. 
As much as I want DC to be dominant this tourney, I guess Punjab ate the only team I'm okay with losing to because they've deserved a ton of wins in the past this season.
I'm also very happy with Dhawan's performance!",3

"Dhawan hit hundred.... 7,14,14,9,10 are the other scores",1
"Dhawan's SR: 173.8

Rest of the team: 98.3",4
Jonty was saying they hope to restrict DC below 190 runs lmao DC batted really poorly the last two games except for Dhawan,1
Is this the worst IPL team score after a player scoring 100? Pathetic.,6
2nd highest score was 14 lmao. Dhawan literally carried this team,6
Pitch is turning and is slow. Dhawan played a blinder but it is a defendable score.,0
Hetmeyer is a proper no.3 for country and franchise cricket elsewhere. I understand DC top order is stacked but surely you can't be sending him in with 15 balls left in the innings,9
"Actually a decent effort with the ball. If someone scored a 100 in a T20 and the total score was 161..

I'd take that and run. Run far.",13
"If Mayank and KL go early, this could be game on",8
"Dhawan - 105 off 61 balls
Rest of the team - 54 off 59 balls

"This may as well be Dhawan's Dream IPL. 

(No pun intended).",11
"Dhawan: 106(61), rest of the DC : 54(59)",6
"If Shami can bowl like this at the death for a sustained period of time then we have a formidable death bowling line up, even with the assumption that Bhuvi keeps getting injured. But for everyone getting excited, Shami has always had these games where he's in the zone. The problem has always been reproducing it game after game. No guarantee that he won't be bowling slower ball bouncers that will be getting sent in to the stands in two games' time.",5
Hopefully the pitch is absolutely garbage now so they can't score.,3
How pathetic other batsmen played couldn't even score at run a ball,7
"Dhawan 106(61) 



Others 58(59) including extras  




Moral of the story: sensible batting is overrated. You've got only 20 overs. Instead of one player hitting 70(55), better have 2 guys who make 40(27).



The brand of sensible batting that says take deep and then go bonkers works better in ODIs or in T20 in case you are 20/3 in 4 overs. Otherwise just go out and have fun, you've only 20 overs.",8
"Top knock by Dhawan, but damn, he was man alone out there... Hopefully the pitch is actually tough to bat on and Dhawan is just magic.",2
This inning by DC reminds of that ODI in which South Africa scored 265-2 off 50 overs. Didn't seem troubled by wicket loss but never really pushed on either,2
Why did kxip bowl good death overs ?,2
[deleted],5
Come on we can’t always have one guy carrying our batting. Shaw and Iyer need to step up. Pant too.,6
Can't believe we've become Shikhar Dhawan and Inshallah lately. No one else contributing. Shame.,8
SRH is owned by a billionaire and they couldn’t give Dhawan a little extra money under the table. Pathetic that we released him.,25
Shami and Bumrah bowling with chahal and sundar will be a dream to watch.,6
Good lord! Dhawan scored a century @173 SR  and the total is only 164?,9
"They're a bit below par, but if anyone can defend this it's Delhi",2
Hope India recall Shami in T20i format,2

"Dhawan was amazing today. I'd say this was a better innings than the one vs CSK.  
Clean striking. Proper cricket shots and countered the spin very well unlike Pant who got bogged down.  
Performance to be proud of",2
"DC's bang average batting getting exposed. Shaw, Iyer, Pant, Stoinis are all hype and no bite. Their bowling is their last hope.",-5
Shitty innings from Delhi. They were carried by one guy,5
It’s a bit crazy that Dhawan has a ton from like 60 balls and total score is only 164,4
Back to back unbeaten hundreds.. this is amazing stuff,2
"KXIP 20th over economy rate before this match was close to 20, they bowled brilliantly at death today.",2
Dhawanto his teammates.. Mai adhe run bna deta hu aap log jake dream 11 pe team bna lo..,9
Shami was Dhoni's go to death bowler in 2015 WC. For a guy of his talent his IPL numbers are very poor. 2 good finishes here and maybe he finds the consistency finally.,1
I wish yorkers were a separate match statistic so my man Shami could get a MoM,9
"Taking a shot everytime someone mentions the Dhawan v Rest of DC stat.


Wish me luck boys!",12
"Literally everyone else shat the bed so hard, smh with a player century only 164",7

"Rahul, Mayank, Gayle, Pooran, Maxwell, Hooda and Neesham should be able to chase this subpar total. C'mon kxip, win a game nice and early for once!",9
"KL, Mayank, Gayle, Pooran... IF they all fire for at least 30 runs each,  Punjab has this in the bag",4
Dhawan scored 64.6% of the team's runs. Surely this has to be a t20 record?,4
[deleted],2
"If we replace Shaw at the top with Stoinis, we will have a much stronger team. Bring in Rahane at 3 with the role of playing through the innings. One of these 3 will inevitably bat through the innings while others just hit.

That’s been my preferred line up even before the tournament. I hope they figure it out before the playoffs. 

Shaw is a disaster in playoffs for me. It is a risk we absolutely don’t need to take. He will probably also drop a catch in the field lol.",3
"Delhi batting today : 

Dhawan - Giga Chad

Everybody else - Extra Virgin",8
"Gotta get KL, Mayank, and Pooran then it's easy win.

Edit: Forgot about Gayle Lol",5
Pant innings hurt DC total could cost them the match. Excellent stuff from Punjab,6
"Got to say, good stuff from Kxip inbthe end. DC was set on a bigger total",4
Our batting has severely underperformed except some individual performances. Our bowlers save our asses,6
Drop the overrated kid Prithvi Shah. He is affecting the momentum of the entire team.,2

DC - Gabbar = smol pp. Quick maffs bitches!!,8
Why did gabbar leave us man? He was pretty decent,3
Pant 14(20) has been hanging out with the wrong crowd. I can feel the spark go out here...,11
But can Dhawan keep wickets?,10
In before Punjab scores 120/0 then fucks up and ties with 164/5 and then wins it in super over,11
two unbeaten hundreds. average go brrr,17
Dhawan hasn’t been out in 40 overs now,12
Take this to another super over please,4
Lowest team total with a century after Stokes 103 in 163?,6
Open with stoinis/rahane. Hetmyer should be playing a bit above.,5
SRH boys calm down. Dhawan achieved everything at SRH. Now he wants to play for his hometown. Let's not talk about what we got in return.,17
Well now other teams know our weakness. Do everything you possibly can to get Shikhar out. Aim for his offside too.,7
People here hating on Delhi when they are playing against fucking Punjab - the weakest middle order in the tournament. We stand no chance vs rabada,5
Shikhar Dhawan: Beta ek zamana tha jab hum bhi gareeb hua karte the,9
Dhawan drinking sparkling water,3
"Shikhar means PEAK

Dhawan means THE ONE",5
"Not joking but if KXIP keep executing death overs like they have done in past 3 games, they have a very strong(if not the strongest) top 4, and i will be tempted to back them to chase any sort of targets on any pitch.
Chances of Top 4 looking a bit clear now",7
Ashwin's spell will be very important,2
"Without Nortje DC had to score 15-20 runs extra today. They've been getting away with the 160 ish totals because of his partnership with Rabada, will be interesting to see how his absence affects the side today.",9
"Not at all confident Sams will do well against players of this quality, but still interested to see how he goes. Might have the advantage of not been seeing by a lot of players, but I feel like his variations may be worked out pretty quickly by quality players.",3
Excluding Dhawan only 2 fours & 2 sixes has been hit,6
[Shami's death stare!](https://i.imgur.com/ecCaU8v.jpg),3
"Take a bow Shikhar! He has made a great statement with these two back to back knocks. That's the only way to answer criticism.

He has been so immense for India in ODIs. Really wish that he and Rohit get to be a part of a WC winning side along with Virat.",5
"Well Dhawan in form, now I don't see we how we can have Rohit Sharma in T20, rahul is there and Mayank is also good. . Rohit is irreplaceable on odi but in T20 don't think we need him . Also we have youngesters like padikal too",-1
"Anything other than:

Rahane
Dhawan
Iyer
Pant
Hetty
Stoinis

for the next game is wrong. I still back Shaw to regain his spot but he needs serious fixing up. Shreyas & Rishabh need to step up more often. Can't overly rely on your bowling each game. A quality deep batting line-up like the one of Kings XI will definitely cause headaches at the end.",3
Looks like dropping Jordan was not a bad idea tbh. We have 7 Batsmen now and it's important of a collapse (likely) happens,2
Rabada gonna get an early power play wicket easily,2
"First dc changed their name, now Dhawan changed his jersey no.

Ab chronology samjhe?",5
So this is what's happening. Shikar Dhawan scores a century in 10 overs. Rest of them will take 10 balls each to get set before perishing and we end up with a 160 odd score. Need to step up.,3
Is Dhawan the most underrated IPL player lol,3
That elephant atta ad with fat Indian kid oof,2
I’m impressed with all these professional cricketers. The skill to always spit through the grill of the helmet is astounding,8
Just realized that the next IPL is almost six months away 👌,5
"Drop Shaw, Iyer and Pant please DC management. 

Open with Rabada and Dhawan. Bring back Amit Mishra @ 3 (he can help steady the ship) and Rahane @ 4.",0
Lmao I forgot Sams was playing. Excited to see how this goes,4
Shikhar Dhawan is currently 207* in 19.5 Overs. Petition to make Dhawan a new franchise in IPL 2021.,29
Hoping kkr loses tomorrow and the top 4 position actually goes to a deserving team,4
OK I'm loving this new shami now. Can we have shami and bumrah for India t20s now please,12
There should be an award exclusively for the bowlers based on the maximum no. of dot balls played in their overs.,10
Everyone struggles against Ashwin except.......umm....Glenn Maxwell 😀,7
Shaw looks to arrogent and egoistic to improve his technique lol,6
Dhawan getting into form is a good sign. But they need to up their batting in case if they lose Gabbar early.,6
"7 Deep today chasing 164, feeling good about our chances",1
Shami Ahmed was brilliant today.,2
Kxip are way too reliant on Rahul and need to step up if he's out early. He can't play anchor in every match,3
So how good is Daniel Sams? Never heard of this left arm fast bowler.,1
ash vs gayle. 2011 final flashbacks.,3
Gearing up for an Ashwin masterclass against his former team. Don't forget he got two wickets in his first over and then got injured in the other match against KXIP.,1
I feel like KXIP are the kind of team who'd prefer chasing 180 rather than 160 because it makes KL just a little less complacent. He's the one who'll be inevitably carrying their chase anyway..,3
IPL is a long tournament and there are always phases to how a team performs. Thats why no team can afford to get complacent. Peaking at the right time as a team is so so important. MI is great at that.,7
Only if Dhawan performed this well before his 5.2crs auction bid.,1
"Little late here, but kxip did a great job restricting dc at 164",1
Rahul vs Rabada will be nice to watch,1
Hope Punjab wins this easily. Then kkr loses tomorrow. Without KXIP playoffs will be boring,3
Average total and No Nortje. We are losing this one.,6
How good is Daniel Sams?,2
"Shami really wants to get into that Ghost Protocol photoshop, worked his ass off today",2
"At this point, we should just drop Shaw for accountability.",6
What if Kxip opens with Neesham and Maxwell today?,6
Dhawan apology thread incoming. Brace yourselves :),10
Kohli and Shami both found form in a super over!,12
"What a bowling performance, DC batters couldn't play one shot that went in Chris Gayle's direction.",2
"Hope KXIP wins this, I want them in the top 4!",9
WTH 164 ain't enough,4
Shaw needs to be dropped.,1
"Kxip need to stop relying on Rahul. The man has done great but he can't step up everytime

Reminds me of rcb relying heavily on Gayle in 2011. Gayle carried the team destroying everyone in his path EXCEPT in the finals when he got lbwed in the second ball to ashwin",8
"Dhawan: 106*
Next highest score: 14

Surely some sort of record??",5
क्या bakchodi है ये,2
Rest of dc's batting lineup is cricket's version of unreliable narrator.,2
"I'll be really surprised if a Nortje less DC attack defend this mediocre total against the likes of KL, Mayank, Gayle and Pooran.",9
Can we even defend this?,3
"Maxwell to counter Ashwin, Neesham to Rabada, expect change in batting order",1
[deleted],-13
I think Dhawan's century is gonna be the big outlier here. His batting made this pitch look easier than it is.,5
"Nortje has actually been the impact bowler this season rather than rabada imo. Nortje picks up the crucial wickets, rabadas wickets usually come cleaning up the tail or lower middle order.",1
Honestly thought the score would be higher the way Dhawan was playing. Sadly he kept losing partners on the other end,5
KXIP now win pls. No messing around like you did with MI.,2
"From Cricbuzz
Lowest 1st innings total to contain an individual 100 (IPL):

164/5 S Dhawan 106* DC v KXIP 2020,

170/4 M Pandey 114* RCB v Deccan 2009,

177/4 D Warner 107* DD v KKR 2010",3
"DC Supporters to Dhawan:

Mein toh tereko haraami samajhta tha, tu toh dev maanus nikla re 🙏",4
"Shaw is actually one of those players I am never convinced by even when he scores runs lol.

And yeah, I thought Sehwag was very convincing as a batsman. Like I could see a method to his madness.",2
Pls win tomorrow RCB.,3
"As much as we are fuming on Shaw, we can count on Punter to be similar level pissed. But he won't be dropped, and honestly shouldnt be. He needs to get better asap",4
"Dhawan got back in form with a slow 50. Shaw have the luxury to try that. Have to change his footwork and arm movement like kohli and rohit did. Playing your natural game doesn't mean, you can't change at all. 
Pant, sadly, doesn't have the fortune to try that. Any idea, what changed in pant? He has been in insane form in ipl for last 3 years.",1
Chris Gayle made his 1st class debut 2 years before Ravi Bishnoi was born. Thank you,8
"Still feel KL, Rohit and Mayank be the openers for wt20",-2
[deleted],1
Gabbar is the ultimate chad,2
"With the kind of match KXI had on sunday, I'm hoping it managed to win a few more fans.",5
"Dhawan 106 off 61, rest of DC just 58 in 59 balls.",3
Kasigo Rabada kar do kabada,1
Hit pair of this IPL walks in :),1
"Gives me the vibes of season opener of 2013 prolly

Mi vs RCB where gayle played through n scored 92 but RCB cud only manage 158

Won by 2 runs at the end, sachin pointing opening for first time, too many memories",1
Can rahane replace shaw?,5
All my MI homies cheer for KXIP,9
"Ashwin will help Kings 11 win this after all the hard work Shami put in. That would be the ethical move, in my humble opinion",6
[deleted],5
"Dhawan: 106 runs, 61 balls, 12 fours, 3 sixes. 

The rest: 54 runs, 59 balls, 2 fours, 2 sixes.",6
Daniel Sams in the IPL feels like a weird fever dream,9
Sams has got to be nervous,2
"Except Robbie in 2014, no other team won the IPL with a player owning orange cap",1
Where's my boi Nokia?,7
Mayank 0(1) pl0x,2
Daniel Sams reminds me of Officer Doofy from Scary Movie,2
sams looks like discount wolverine,4
"Who is Sams, first time I'm seeing the dude.",4
idk who Daniel Sams even is tbh lol,10
How do u guys rate Sams ?,3
what happened to nortje? not caught up with team news,1
Daniel Sams is a BIG UNIT^TM,3
"Pant thighs versus Thiccmeyer booty.

Choose one!",14
"Daniel ""Finn"" Sams",9
Why do players wear two caps I've seen Warner Maxwell Iyer and Morgan wear a cap over a cap.,6
Tried to mankad,8
Welcome to the IPL Sams,6
Bowling no ball while bowling under 140ks should be illegal,-2
Putting the freehit to where it belongs.,3
Thought why all of a sudden umpire started calling no balls Lmaoooooooo,5
Daniel Whomst,1
"You can take the man out of the BBL

But you can't take the BBL out of the man",9
Long long long maaan,3
Why the fuck is that a nb,2
Sams in Ricky Ponting quota,9
That was a great shot ngl,6
So it's proved: Nokia > Sams-ung,18
Was almost expecting Mark Nicholas to say LONG LONG MAN,9
What if you knock the bails off accidentally but appeal for mankad?,3
You reckon we can win this even if KL departs early?,4
Sams' action is similar to tait's,3
Sams be yorkin,3
Sams bowling as if asked he's asked to bowl for the first time in his career ever.,3
Who is this Sam guy? Never heard of him,5
"The fickleness, 1 shot for six and already being declared bad.",20
Calling that a no ball? Bit harsh on the bowlers I think,11
Why isn't mankading a no-ball if that was? Stupid rule.,2
Still find it hilarious that Steven Finn has had a lasting effect on international cricket for the most shithouse thing possible,11
"how about an IPL team of these oldies - sujith somsundar, atul bedade,  amey khurasia, ritinder sodhi, vikram rathore, ajay ratra, dodda ganesh, sairaj bahutule, tinu yohanan, abey kuruvilla, pankaj singh",3
Only 4 legal balls have been bowled but cricinfo show rahul's score as 7\*(5) why?,4
Sams sorta has the slinging yorker of Malinga,11
Sam bowling well aside from that nb.,8
Why is Nortje out?,3
Guys in the thread. He's a pretty decent bowler in the big bash. Picked up 30 wickets in the last season,3
Knocking off bails while bowling is no ball now? Boy bowlers do get reamed in ICC universe if that is the case.,2
Rahul's stone-cold look scares me. Man is dead inside.,10
1 no ball ruined that over. There is absolutely no margin for error in T20,4
Sams looks like the guy who partied 3 nights straight without sleeping for getting place in IPL playing XI,2
Gayle should've opened today. He'd have gone after the fast bowlers and would have brought the RRR more down.,2
Good first over aside from flicking the bails. Unfortunate.,8
Sams looks like a clean shaven Bruno Fernandes,7
Wanting to see Rahul bat and wanting Delhi to win.,2
Is it not counted as a run out attempt if he hits the stumps with the ball on the follow through and a dead ball?,3
"Wow, Roy and Dhawan opening would've been mental.",5
Wouldnt mind if we tuk tuk every single Rabada ball,2
Could Sams argue he was trying a Mankad?,3
Sams kinda reminds me of Nannes,6
"That ball went so high, It Could Have Got an Air Hostess Down with It! - Sidhu, Long long ago.",7
"Channeling my inner hindi commentary, Rabada Karo kabada",7
Lmao just noticed sams doesn't have a chin,3
Can’t you abort your run up if hit the wickets?,4
Why are they having a go at Dominic Cork? He’s explaining a genuine issue that bowlers have.,3
BC Lara be trollin',3
"Someone shut this ""Brian Lara"" fellow in the dugout lol. What does this mutt even know about cricket anyways.",9
Knocking the stump was a dead ball before. But batsmen are unfairly punished if they hit a 4/6. So now its a no-ball...fair because its a bowler's mistake.,9
Rabada has such soft skin,17
Sams is instantly Ashwin's favourite cricketer for knocking off those bails,13
bro who has Rabada's skin care routine?,6
"Just tuned in, what did I miss?",2
"Steven finn effect like we call mankard what shd be call this noball , suggest interesting names",3
Mayank Agarwal never looks convincing against short ball but doesn’t get out to it enough lol,7
Is it me or Mayank looks like a lighter Pooran ?,3
[deleted],14
"Why is rabada brought in here.

He only takes wickets in the death overs.",1
After kohli came into limelight. Almost all indian players have a tattoo sleeve or something.  Wonder if that is a thing in indian cricket now a days.,2
At this expansion rate Pant will be needing a new set of pants within a few weeks,8
"What is this dugout, and how do I get a piece of the action on hotstar",3
Shami bout to bring his economy down if he nails the Yorkers in coming games.,4
I don't know why that Finn no ball law was introduced. Call it a dead ball and move on. Bowler wacks his fingers off the stumps and is then punished again.,3
"If Hotstar can have PL replays, why can't it have IPL replays?",2
Diwali edition phone? That's a first.,7
Fielding cost 2 runs there just for those who don’t care about fielding.,4
"What's happening r/cricket? Simran Thicc Boi, Kagiso ""Soft Skin"" Rabada?",4
India's 2 main fast bowlers among the top wicket takers. Feels good,10
"Why is everyone considering that no ball harsh ? 

A Batman would lose his wicket. Rashid just did the other day. 

And no that's not mankading a Batman either, you don't bowl when you do that.",8
Ah bowler roulette again by Iyer.,3
I didn't watch after 13th over. Wtf happened. How did they only make 165. Not complaining very happy,1
Axar here for revenge ffs,3
Has ashwin mankad anyone while playing for India?,3
"Why would you rest the man, the myth, the beast, the nemesis of Rawalpindi express, the south African sexy supergiant though?",2
That single could be the difference of super over and a win,4
Axarrrrrr,1
Why no Nakia 5610?,3
"Kohli's lage raho, seekte raho great learning ad is a direct attack on Dhoni-CSK.",5
Should Axar be in squad for Australia?,3
Ah Pant finally you are back,2
India is blessed for having both kL and Dhawan as probable opners,2
"I'm in a mental dilemma, I want KXIP to win but don't want to see Dhawan on the losing side.",6
"Dream 11 Gamechanger of the season top 5  
1 ) One of the most aesthetically pleasing batsmen in intl cricket  
2) SA's premier fast bowler  
3) Experienced SA batsman with proven credentials  
4) India's Test Opener  
5) Rahul Tewatia",3
"It is hard to believe that Rabada isn't in top 3 fastest bowlers this IPL. Archer, Nortje, Lockie, Saini. First time this many 150+ bolwers playing in the IPL.",4
Axar my man,2
YESSIR,3
"Man youngsters need to look upto Kohli in terms of dedication to the sport in  fitness, Dude is a generational talent and still doesn't take a single chance with it.

Instead they try to emulate Sharma ji ka launda",11
Interesting.,4
Anchor pulled out.....,3
Poor shot...,3
Axar bitches. The X factor baby,5
Universe boss time,3
Hmm... Gg then?,3
50% batting gone,2
Time to go to sleep,3
Ah fuck,1
"Apparently Rabada has a 12 inch cock. Maxwell should use it as his bat, might be easier to find the middle.",2
Axar has been soooo good this season for us.,3
kxip to giyoo,2
Oh God why,2
Axar the magic arm,1
Fuck off. Fuck yay!,1
KL performs everytime. Terms and Conditions- Against DC may not,6
Noice. That was a dumb shot to play but we’ll take it.,5
"Got dugout, thanks bois",9
"Ah shit, here we go again...",9
"Huge wicket!! 

KL Rahul out in first 3 instead of last 3.",8
"Axar you beauty, won us the last match, almost won us this one",4
This is not ideal. You just hit a boundary KL my man.,9
Axar just dismissed 3/4th of Punjab batting,12
Big wicket. Shame cause he was looking good again.,7
Anchor gone. KXIP is fucked.,9
In b4 reactionary r/cricket goes on abt how trash kL is,9
"Can't wait for KXIP to make this easy chase very difficult, then very easy, then very difficult and eventually super over.",18
This is a pre planned wicket.,8
"That's a fantastic comeback from Axar, what a bowler he's been so far this season.",5
Scott Styris looks like a Panamanian White-faced Capuchin,1
KL PD ho gaya,3
"Sams can take simple catches, guess he didn't get the IPL fielding memo",9
Honestly if we lose to the Universe Boss... I'm not even mad,3
"**2.2** Patel to Rahul, OUT, huge wicket. A rare Rahul failure **17-1**

KL Rahul c Sams b Patel 15 (11b 1x4 1x6) SR: 136.36",3
Kl why? Unnecessary shot,1
The word ‘fuck’ doesn’t quite capture how I feel,3
Kxip tail exposed,3
This is because everyone kept berating him about strike rate,7
Punjab starting to choke already?,2
ow man this is chasable. hope for a maxi special tonight. he better step up,2
Bruh Rehul,3
'~~Strike rate~~ Scoring runs is overrated',12
Get in Ashwin next over.,3
"50% of runs, gone",7
"Cork is being a little bitch in dugout. Just because he had a problem...

When you mankad, you're not delivering a ball to the batsman so it's fine. If you knock the bail off and continue delivering the ball, no ball. No need to argue some stupid shit against the rules",5
Why are DC so fucking OP,5
"Dammit, the KL wicket helps Punjab",7
Bad choice of shot imo,2
"Gayle in, next over Ashwin surely!",2
Axar just dismissed the match winning man for KXIP,7
Giving me srh vibes,6
"School: Apne bete ka naam bataen 

Parents: Akshar Patel

School: ok. ""Axar Patel""",6
Still have ptsd from axar,3
"Ah well Rahul out with a strike rate of 150 but it's not helping the team much.

Strike rate as well as taking it deep both depends on the context of the game",3
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say Axar Patel is the best spinner in the history of the game,1
"म्हारो डीकरो, अक्षर!

 T: my lad, Axar!",2
Man I wish I discovered dugout when this IPL started lmao,7
Waiting for Gayle v Ashwin,3
Gayle will cunt Axar right?? Right?,3
Universe boss music intensifies,3
Axar Patel is kinda player who will keep performing in IPL and get picked for T20 WC and get thrashed in semi final. 😭😂😭😂,5
"Everyone is saying ""KXIP's anchor gone"" 

Lol. Get Havells then idk what's the big deal.",1
Axar Patel went from discount Jadeja to discount Yuvraj 2011. Hits sixes at crucial moments. Takes wickets and is economical.,3
70% of punjabs run maker. Gone,3
Probably nothing more satisfying for a bowler than getting a wicket after going for a boundary,1
"I said once yesterday, I'm saying again *Josh ad with Jacqueline Fernandes is cringe af*",2
So everyone has gotten a MOM except Rabada. Is it justified?,1
"I'm asking again , as an RCB fan a KXIP win is desirable, right?",1
The silver lining is that we aren't going to choke in the end. An emphatic loss hurts less,0
How fortune changes when a player goes into a better team and culture. Axar’s fortune as taken a drastic turn,3
Kl ShOuLd AtTaCk FrOm BaLl 1!!,3
Need my main man pooran to score heavily today,1
Yet another Gujarati trumps Rahul.,11
Gayle’s gloves are sweeet,3
Right bring on Ashwin vs Gayle!!,3
Rahul out heats up the best Rahul of the tournament or does it?,0
KL to Gayle: Ab tu bata kya plan hai.,3
"Oh damn, I thought Mumbai last day, Delhi today, how happy would that make me!",1
Ashwin always gets Gayle. Probably on the mind of Iyer now.,1
"What if Ashwin mankad's Gayle?  

Mankad's would 100% be bad again, I think.",0
Just tuned in and Rahul got out??!,3
Dhawan made this pitch look easier than it was. He will be the only player to score above 50 here,3
Maxwell should play a big knock today. He is due for a match saving innings.,8
This is what happens when KL doesnt do tuk tuk.,1
Does anyone know who needs to win here for srh to benefit?,2
I'm shocked. I thought KL was immovable... during powerplay at least.,6
Universe Boss has entered the chat,7
"Today Maxwell will get exposed, either he will become hero if he takes panjab home or will become villain if he gets out without scoring decent score.",3
Would still like to see rest of kxip play their shots,1
"Gayles jersey is 333, he also has 333 sixes for his name in IPL at this moment.
Highest in IPL",3
Has to be Ashwin!,1
Only just managed to turn this on. Good to see KXIP are opening with Gayle again,3
At least the target isnt huge so we can afford to take a bit of time,2
"can someone explain wtf ""mankad"" is? I'm out of the loop",5
Kinda wanna watch Gayle hit sixes... Quite the internal conflict.,6

"Chris vs Rabada is going to be dope!
Hope Chris plays it safe and doesn't gift a wicket to their primary bowler. Lets hope !!!",5
funny how kl has a bad record v delhi while also having scored his 14 ball 50 v them,9
"Woah 145 from Sams, where did that come out of",6
Why does India keep persisting with Nohit when they got left right combination of Dhawan and Rahul,-8
Fuck 145 clicks!,1
Good pace 144.9 kmph,4
Wait? Sams bowling 145? What the fuck,3

"I'm waiting for the gayle show, please don't disappoint me",3
"Chad Brett Lee played back to back to back tests For Australia and bowled at 150+ consistently. 

Virgin Nortje rested after playing a few 4 over games.",9
Perfect opportunity for Mayank to step up today.,1
"No one:

Anjum Chopra: I think that....",4
"No quick singles with Gayle on strike.  
So he has to start striking if he's taking time.  
I know he can make up for it, but will he make up for it THIS TIME? idk",3
All of Sams BBL wickets were shit balls,-1
Just shat the bed... trying to follow in my favourite teams footsteps,2
"Sams is doing quite well, those inswingers are working out",2
Wide calls are so harsh sometimes. That hits him in the thigh if he doesn't move inside the line of the ball,4
Prithvi Shaw looks like bhai from Mumbai.,3
Ashwin vs Gayle is back again. Ashwin vs Maxwell is on the cards too. Used to be blockbuster once upon a time.,5
"Who would you pick for your team ?

Rabada + Nortje or  Bumrah + Boult",8
"Shaw is the worst fielder to put in the deep. Can’t catch, can’t run.",5
"Yes, good idea. Lets target Prithvi in the field.",3
Bruh prithvi looks 35 already,5
why tf is shaw on boundary,11
Love AJIO ads music,3
"Two times KL has got out in the powerplay so far, both times against DC.",8
"How is every players that dehli brings in so good?

They have the strongest bench strength this tourney",9

Beautiful Cut from Chris,2
So apparently Nortje debuted in teh recent India tests. How'd he do?,5
Vintage Gayle's cut,7
Have a feeling Tushar is going to get slaughtered by Gayle,5
tushar is a run machine,4
Specialist fielder Rahane reporting for duty,19
Why is rahane on the field?,5
Why no Ashwin?,7
Elegant Gayle. Not used to sayin that,4
"Tushar you dont bowl there, you simply dont",4
Bowl Ashwin. He will get Gayle out,2
160 odd is not a big total. Please play sensibly,6
Is Daniel Sam's first uncapped overseas player to play in ipl?,0
Mayank Agarwal is a cutie. Never realised before,3
Bowl Ashwin to Gayle. Everyone and their mothers know that but not Iyer!,8
"Gayle looks so matured

I mean he is 40, but still lol. I thought he would go the Afridi route.",4
Chad Gayle on form,5
Gayle Storm is on the cards bois,4
That was a fucking total mishit.... Love his power,9
446 inevitable W incoming,6
Damn...Gayle,4
"Tbh, I don't think it is a very good idea to have a digital money transfer system advertised all over the umpire's clothes",7
It's boss time 😎,3
Sixes go brrr,7
Is Gayle back to destroying careers?,8
"This Tushar Deshpande..  I see some potential in this lad. Could see his inclusion in our XI at some point in the future

Talking about the Thiccness XI btw.",2
Ashwin just ethically steal the ball,6
"Btw fun fact for you guys - Mumbai Indians liked Iyer so much that they wanted him from Delhi Daredevils. They even offered three players in exchange for him in 2016 as trade.


Thankfully the Delhi Management had some sense and didn't let him go",14
Unacademy Cracking six 🤮🤮,5
Out of form Maxwell becomes extra friendly and cheerful,7
Gayle will obliterate weak bowlers.,3
5 feet Deshpandey bowling bouncers to 7 feet Gayle,3
Bruh,3
I'm fine with the Universe Boss beating us... if it's Maxwell or someone else fuck that,6
Gayle finally playing in PP,2
~~boss~~  daddy,2
Boss,1
Gayle making every ground feel like Sharjah,2
Someone tell Tushar you're not bowling to Parthiv,2
"Who is in charge of these crowd chants lmao. Gayle hits a boundary and they play the ""Rahul! Rahul! Rahul!"" chant",3
"This over damn, DC getting punished",2
Vintage GayleStorm!,1
41 years young,5
Bruh,6
"Tushar- Spank me daddy

Gayle- hmmm",5
Smashing the new boys is Gayle's agenda at this point and i like it. Calculative stuff,7
4 short balls... 4 boundaries. Change the plan yaar.,5
"God damn, Gayle smacks the ball so hard. Even the mishits are going to boundaries easily",6
Two vada pavs Tushar and Shaw need to be sent back to Bombay.,4
"LMAO, come on KXIP.",2
"Will never not love a Gaylestorm

Braindead captaincy tho by not bringing Ashwin",14
"Everytime the ball goes in the air, KX fans blood pressure goes up.",7
I am starting to like Harshal Patel now lol,1
Gayle vs young indian medium pacers should be a separate section of the Geneva convention,50
The Boss has picked out the weak link in the armor and is taking advantage,5
Nice spark from the youngster Gayle here,11
"deshpandey running like he's about to cry mid run, and I can understand",5
Bad captaincy. Ashwin should have been bowling this over.,8
My mans Tushar getting slaughtered,6
"all 4 short half-trackers, either the boy has came with a plan or...",2
"Chris Gayle be like:

Let's finish it in 10 minutes!😂",9
So surprising to not see Ash,5
"OMFG, vintage Gayle is back baby",7
Gayle 😍😍😍😍,11
BOSS,9
RCB misses you Gayle,5
That's y boss for pp,3
now 5th one too,2
Oh fuck....newbie having a tough time against Universe Boss,6
BOSS,4
"Dhawan has scored centuries twice in 2 matches. These innings show why he shouldn't be in India's T20I team.

If other top order batsmen like Rohit, KL, or even Virat hits a century then you may be sure of a victory, but not so with Dhawan.",0
Wonder how many domestic Indian bowlers this guy has murdered,4
This is why you need Gayle to open . All KL fans can hate me but he should step down to 3.,5
Bruh moment,5
"Damn Delhi is really missing Ishant. Tried Harshal Patel, didn't work. Even Tushar has been quite expensive",3
HOW EASY WAS THAT? I missed Gayle,3
What a stupid decision. Wasted all that effort.,2
Tushy Deshpande 🍑,7
Bowling short to the universal boss,3
Name a better story than Gayle destroying newbie Indian bowlers,10
Man he has been absolutely MURDERED.,3
Rabada Coming in Next,6
Absolutely brain-dead bowling..,2
"If Tushar bowls 4 overs to Gayle, we'll have 2 more centuries today!!",5
"This reminds me of the time when Gayle destroyed Rahul Sharma's career. If you don't know who he is, don't blame you.",6
Oh man feel for Tushar,4
"Kumble is like this was my plan all along. To keep Gayle out, make him angry and then unleash him.",5
Poor Tushar,4
41 year old takes advantage of youngster,8
He is destroying Tushar's career.,5
"Tushar buddy, what exactly is the game plan here lmao? 

Im not complaining but i simply dont get it",3
This guy just came to bowl after watching the big Short ...,5
Yess Bosss,3
Gayle storm incoming saleyo,3
lmao tushar conceding as many this over as in 4 earlier overs,3
Dude it had to be against the team I like.,2
Absolutely stupid bowling. When will you learn not to bowl short balls.,2
Tushar just undid everything they saved in first overs,7
Lmao what the hell😂,2
We deserve this for putting up a limpdick target despite knowing Gayle is on their team,3
Gayle storm,1
Tushar kinda looks happy though,2
"Ah, I wish we'd won in 2016. Koach, Boss, AB, KL, everyone I love in a team",10
UNIVERSE BOSSSSSS,5
Gayle's still got it.,5
who'd have thought picking the best t20 batsman ever would improve your team?,10
Even Gayle looks disappointed with that delivery,10
Bruh they made brian Lara say Unacademy Cracking six,10
Poor Captaincy by Iyer you don't expose Tushar to these 2 you don't,3
Iyer feeding gayle some pie bowlers during pp. **Big** brain move,9
Boss makes my pp big,6
Bowl a proper bouncer or get cunted,8
Gayle is love Gayle is life,8
Good to see top teams getting spanked by KXIP.,8
Prashanth Parameswaran flashbacks,6
Tushar: Gaand phati padi hai BC,7
Hope the Greek god deigns it a good day to roll his arm over because I don't think Tushar is getting another over lol,5
"""Innikum raja naan. Kaetu paaruda"" 😎",4
146 kmph. All these new lads got pace.,12
Gayle eyeing that 30 ball hundred again lol,18
Gayle storm,9
Ruthless gayle,8
Fucked,5
Yikes Tushar,6
You are bowling at 122 kph  at a shit line and length and that too to the universal boss. WTF did you expect a catch at long on. You need to grow up boi.,12
Must be like net practice for gayle facing tushar,29
Bowl a yorker now or get smashed more,4
Why did they bench Gayle for the first half of the tourney?,7
Universe Boss ending careers since 1999,17
No one from DC is even going to talk to the bowler ... smh,7
"Gayle, thats pedophilia!!!!",9
I missed this,6
Lol. Who doubted Gayle is getting old :),11
Gayle is honestly one of the most intelligent T20 cricketers and that doesn’t get talked about enough,24
"When Gayle started doing this, half the DC Team was in School.",18
Gayle's 3 year older than Dhoni right?,7
"It hurts when people compare Gayle to Dhoni.

He like at least thrice the player lol.",5
"Poor Tushar. Did well in last couple of games but ran into the Universe Boss first up. 

Gayle is like a freight train that will trample anything it's path on it's day.",7
Maxwell knowing he cant replicate that,5
Still the batsman in the world to watch,6
"Fast bowlers of r/cricket, what to do when u get spanked like that?



I cant think of anything other than praying to god and going for a yorker because whatever Deshpande will bowl here, he will get hit.",5
That over probably killed the game for DC.,5
Feel bad for the young guy. Getting absolutely mauled,9
Length balls at good lines are the best to bowl to Gayle who doesn't move his feet much. This is shit tier bowling. He's not even trying anything else and just feeding him shit.,9
Anybody remember Scott styris saying he would absolutely not play gayle? Changed his colors now.,9
Now imagine if dhoni could also connect.,5
"Bhai maa chud gayi, bowl ash next",5
Man I missed this,5
Cheers Iyer for not bowling Ashwin! Good idea you absolute dipshit,2
Ending careers since debut,4
"Is this a strategy to try and entice Gayle into big shots and hopefully get him caught early on, or is this just complete shite? I vote for the latter...",2
"Rajasthan, you know how delhi became a strong team suddenly? Because they got good coaches. Rahul in past and pointing in present. Why can't you get good coaches? Cant you take adam Gilchrist? Also you have Shane warne who is the goat. You fucktards made him your brand ambassador. Fucking appoint him as the head coach.",2
"Gayle should open, period",0
Gayle literally did more in one over than Maxwell the whole year,5
"When Gayle started doing this, half the DC Team was in School.",5
Really missing Nortje here.,2
You love to see it,3
"Prithvi doesn't move according to his age, weight or height",5
Gayle rn: *I'm still worthy*,7
"Even though I'm DC fan, enjoying Universe Boss",3
Gayle absolutely muscles balls but yet led it looks so effortless,3
Gayle literally smashed his way to get the team to 10 RR.,4
I think gayle has done the damage. Doesn't matter if he gets out now lol. Not bringing in ashwin cost them,4
This is how Thala's fans imagine him now.,3
Gayle feasts on uncapped Indian pacers. Still.,9
KXIP need to change their pants,6
Wow what a difference one bad decision can make.,6
KXIP's run rate literally went from 5 RPO to 10 RPO in just one over. lmao,7
1 over too late,1
Gayle and Mayank as openers has been such a missed opportunity for KXIP,2
Wtf gayle is unreal . He played in India tour of windies in 1999. And is still tonking them around.,6
Some stick cricket shit going on here,3
Chris not-good-enough-to-get-into-a-shit-KXIP Gayle seems to be on a mission!,6
333 vs 999,2
Gayle just increased the current run rate from 6 to 10 that over,4
lmao Dravid in the cardekho ad. What a madlad,6
Looks like Punjab has decided to end the match early today👍🏽😂,1
Put some respect on the name,3
KXIP looking like a whole different team now,1
This was proof that we win despite Iyer’s captaincy instead of because it. Can bowl Rabada/Ashwin to take wickets but instead wants to protect the 5th bowler!,1
"Gayle's timing on that last six was beautiful. He's not just a slogger (as some think)..he's a violent artist. Violent yes, but also an artist.",2
Learn from the experience Tushar,2
No Gayle don't run 2 in this please,2
"You bowl next

No, you bowl next!",4
Damn son Punjab would be top if Gayle played from game 1,4
I can't believe people here were comparing Dhoni and Gayle currently.,4
ASH ANNAAAAAAA,1
Freaking again,2
I called it!!,5
I was told that people above 35 can only do tuk tuk.,8
Oh fuck what a inswinger,3
Ash has his number. Well bowled!,2
Ashwin. Why man??,3
Well... there's the match.,2
Oh ofc Ashwin's bunny,5
What the heck,3
Ethical power > physical power,3
Ashwin just won us the game,2
Oh well.. it was fun while it lasted. :(,3
Ashwin always gets him,7
2011 Flashbacks,5
you know when you have to say youre ok but youre not,7
Let's get it motherfuckers,6
Bruh,2
">Gayle is honestly one of the most intelligent T20 cricketers and that doesn’t get talked about enough


Definately. In the last dugout game, Gayle was trying to hit Chahar. He mistimed one ball and then Gayle on Dugout said that knowing Gayle, he won't take a risk this over. He didn't. Just took singles that over after that",0
just muttered yaar bowled karo gayle karo,3
Send maxi in not Nicky p,3
WTF MADLAD SWANN. SOMEBODY STOP HIM !!,1
Fuck yeah,9
Ashwin baby I love you and miss you,3
People will be writing Gayle off when he's 60 and still hitting the longest sixes,8
Now that was hella dumb,8
It was just about time ........why Gayle whyyyy,3
Saw that coming,4
Ethical is still  India's best spinner without a doubt,10
Like clockwork,2
"Ah well,",2
Shit,3
Didn't need a big brain move to bring Ashwin,3
SEND MAXWELL,3
Chod ta lmaoo,2
I knew it,2
2011 final flashbacks,7
GAYLE RAN A 2 KLAXON,3
Jinxed him lol,2
2011 vibezzz right now,6
Gayle did his job,1
Chad Ashwin!,2
Bye bye Gayle. You don't pinch hit real bowlers,2
Delhi. The phoenix that rises from the ashes,3
Gayle buddy why. You know you struggle against Ashwin.,10
Should have brought him in 2 overs earlier,4
Holy shit world class delivery that,2
woahhhhhh!!!11,1
"I started watching IPL only a couple of years back. I can see why Gayle must have been a monster during his youth if he can do such hitting at this age.   

E: :(",6
"Without KL and Gayle, Mayank has to stay till the end",9
[deleted],10
Ok punjab fans pack it up lmaoo,6
Punjab's lower middle order looks good with Hooda and Neesham,5
Knew it,3
How many times has Ashwin gotten him,7
This would've happened an over earlier and we would've had 20 odd runs in the bank. But alas whatever..,2
CSK need to buyback Ashwin,6
Gayle bruh that wasn't meeded,6
Petition to rename Ashwin to BossSlayer!,10
Ashwin you God you can Mankad my ass all night,39
"You don't let a player like Gayle settle in

You're supposed to attack when he is still trying to get his rhythm.",10
The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long RIP christopher henry gayle,4
Fuck Punjab in trouble now,8
r/cricket jinxing IPL since prehistoric times😂🤦🏽‍♂️,5
Gayle you doofus!!! Could have played out that over.,3
BC Iyer cost us 20 runs there which can make a difference as the end.,1
Cue Keh ke lunga,1
Done his job though Gayle. He's brought down the RRR enough that KXIP can play easy for a while.,10
Swannn getting everything right XD,3
Aswin to Gayle: bas smurf Kar Tu ... noob sale,3
"golu seems to be sad with gayle wicket, maybe he was learning a thing or two...",3
bunny alert,2
"Ashwin need to play in Aus Tests right? Warner, Wade, Head and Starc all Lefties ❤️",2
Bruh Ashwin's got to be IPL's greatest find,4
Ashwin's probably the only bowler that has troubled Gayle to this level,3
Tushar thanking his stars that he didn’t have to bowl one more over to the boss this match.,3
My brother is saying it's Maxwell's day today.,5
Sanga was so on point. Why not bowl Ashwin earlier when he has a history of getting the best of Gayle?,6
Ashwin is too OP for left handed batsman.,6
"29(13) is not bad.  
but he could have done more. Just wait for the weak link.  
Some other time.",5
Seems like Mayank is gonna carry this till the end,9
Well better late than never,2
As a RCB fan I am having PTSD of 2011 RCB vs CSK final :) I was scared because Gayle was not just able to read Ashwin and he got out when he was needes the most....,2
"**5.2** Ashwin to Gayle, OUT, oh he still takes him out. To say that he has the wood on Gayle will be an understatement **52-2**

CH Gayle  b Ashwin 29 (13b 3x4 2x6) SR: 223.07",5
Bring in Maxwell,1
Virtually half the batting down.,4
I guess that is why everyone wanted Ashwin to come on as soon as Gayle walked in to bat.,5
Maxwell in IPL = Minwell,9
Gayle couldve hit Tushar for 100 runs in 4 overs but decided to go after Ashwin ☹️,9
Foregone conclusion really,1
This is going to the last over now if Mayank carries his bat,1
"Haha the previous over got Gayle too excited, perfect strategy",6
29(13) >>>> 28(28),15
And so ends the Gayle storm.,4
Well that wasn't very ethical,2
How ludicrous is it that CSK let go of Ashwin 🤦‍♂️,3
"LOL, they dropped Ashwin from the Indian team and searched for 15 other bowlers; now they're going to come right back to the ethical King.",7
Gayle no :(,1
How did that not spin,3
Ashwin hates us way too much. Fuck our management,7
Here comes my most fav player to watch .please play a long innings pooran,5
999 > 333,7
Are we seeing a maxi special today?,2
"Shitting on Tushar would be bad, Gayle did that to best of bowlers. Iyer boi should've bowled ethical mind that over instead.",5
Guys I'm getting the SRH chase vibe ffs,3
Nicky please play sensibly,2
Should have sent Maxwell,4
Class cover drive from a Lefty. Lets go Pooran laddd,5
"Ash you beauty. Was wondering why they didn't bring him on as soon as Gayle came in. Young Tushar would have been saved.

Ash has been a bogey for Universe Boss over the years.",6
Ethical revenge,2
Perfect opportunity for Pooran and even Maxwell.,3
"Absolutely no turn, perfectly done",2
How does anyone manage to score anything with /r/Cricket jinxing the shit out of everything,5
Punjab batsmen are in hurry. Good for DC,2
Pooran is so good to watch man,2
Pooran doesn't settle lol,2
Ashwin da Man 😎,2
"I dont know why you guys are so appreciative of Iyer, but i think he is not a very good captain. He makes horrible decisions at times and his field placements are also not well approached.",-1

They're batting at 6th gear only,2
Bruh this hindi commentator just called him ASS-WIN,6
"well, at least Gayle performed well with the opportunities he has been given so far.",3
Net run rate gents,4
I love how Maxwell makes us all believe but manages to disappoint more often than not.,8
"Graeme Swann humour reminds me of Eddie Hall, are all Britishers like that?",8
If KXIP play this smart. This should be a walk in the park honestly. Required RR is under 8.,6
Pant- Execute Order 66,5
"Ethics had him for soup and dessert there. Still 29(13) could basically be game breaking, the chase is at 7.5 runs an over because of that onslaught.",8
What the actual fuck,2

3 times Gayle = Ashwin",10
Mayank needs to be sensible here,3

Well done!!.... That's one way to lose your playoff chances,9
Kxip will always be shit,2

Punjab choking it hard. Damn.,17
Fuck my life,19
Only Punjab could have done that,16
Mayank is hurt.,7
" C O L L A P S E 

Please?",7
No one can Dare snatch a single from The Ethical Mind..,12
Bhenchod this is the team we lost to.,15
ok so we are LEGIT. once Shaw and Pant play a little more consistently we should be unbeatable unless we play Mumbai,4
Mayank injured too,7
Probably pulled a muscle too. WTF were they doing?,3
There was always a run there!,7
"It's really good to see my team dominate, but I really feel for Kings XI.",11
Gayle was clearly trying to boss Ashwin to show him off. Should've played him through,6
WHY DID MAYANK HAVE TO SACRIFICE,6
"Serious question to all Punjab fans, why does your team like to choke? Like WHY????",4
Pooran has absolutely no game awareness,4
2nd time Mayank run out by the other batsman this season.,6
KXIP back to their old ways. Normalcy restored.,7
"Wow, making it difficult for themselves.",6
"This is KXIP's game. If they end up losing, its just KXIP way of doing things. Aaaaand yes.",5
KXIP doing a KXIP,5
Whyyy,4
Why do i support this shit team,7
Mayank clearly sacrificed himself there,8
R Ashwin giving his very best against KXIP lol,7
WTFFFF????  There was no run there.,3
Minwell on the crease,5
Adding injury to insult,8
Oh yeah we are dead,7
"Oh shit, Maxwell's here",4
Fucking idiots,2
Mayank has gone from the crease. This match is over for KXIP.,4
This is village stuff.,3

Poor Mayank gave up his wicket there. Pooran better make it count.,4

Called 2 in 2 to my father... He is kinda feeling proud,2
"RRR is under control, just bat sensibly guys lol",3
KXIP has too much talent to be sitting alongside CSK. Hopefully that changes today.,3
How many runouts has Aggarwal got this season? Dont think it was his first,5
Summary for KXIP'S whole campaign,1
Banter team strikes again,2
That was entirely Mayank's fault. Caught ball watching.,3
Delhi didnt even have to do anything get all 3 wickets. Fucking gifted.,7
Glenn and Nicholas together. Is Maxwell gonna score >5 or >10 or >15 or >20?,1
I am so livid right now. Cruising along and we have to do these stupid stunts,3

Time for Aussie Thala to come.,4
More worried about Mayank's injury,3
"Gayle just brought the RRR to 7.5, can't wait for these  clowns to make it 10 in quick time",5
There goes Punjab’s chances of winning,3
Wtf when 165 is needed they bat like they r chasing 200.,4
Pooran  seriously needs to mature,5
Maxwell will play a sensible knock today,1
Spot fixing spotted,-5
"As a long-time KXIP fan, we won’t make it to 150. I guess this is it for us.",2
Poor Mayank . Such a selfless player . Always the sacrificial goat.,2
Both could hv made it,5
Of course this team can’t do anything correctly,3
Mayank is such a nice guy. Any other batsman would have just let the other guy get out,6
"Ohh man, Ashwin vs Maxwell is pure IPL.",5
That was actually a good call by Pooran.,4
The last hope has gone,2
Stand straight you piece of shit maxi,5
Horrendous,4
There was a single there mayank shouldn't have stopped.,10
[deleted],3
rrr < 8. whats the hurry?????,6
"Once a meme team, always a meme team",3
Bullet throw from ethical mind,4
 agarwal sacrificed himself there. Pooran was at fault for running despite being told no.,7
Sometimes the pressure of trying to get away from facing a premiere bowler leads to such poor decisions to run.,2
Bc Ashwin ka over khatam nhi hua ab tak,2
Maxwell will take Punjab home today boys,3
Ok maxwell has more than enough time to het settled today,2
Another ATG matchup of the IPL: Ashwin to Maxwell.,2
Mayank been run out how many times now this season?,3
So many bad run outs in this IPL it's not even funny anymore. These guys are international level players running like they're in a village game.,6
❤️ Ashwin is love. Ashwin is life. ❤️,8
Arey yar,2
"Big Show, please deliver this game. Expecting nothing less than a proper innings from you !!",3
Poornan just screwed over Mayank big time. The call from Mayank was loud and clear and Pooran went through with the run anyway. Hope Pooran doesn't throw away his wicket after what he just did.,10
KXIP is peak Pakistan in antics and shithousery,17
What's the over - under on Maxi today? I am saying he would do better and score atleast 15 today,3
If Maxwell doesn't turn up today might as well drop him.,3
This is Maxwell's day. Calling it now,11
Istg if Mayank is injured,3
Trying to figure out who won this powerplay...,2
Who do you guys think is winning? I think it’s 70/30 DC bc this Punjab middle order isn’t reliable,2
KXIP: **Are you not entertained?**,7
"That's why gayle should open, can go explosive from the start and Rahul can come in at 3 and play according to situation",1
"You wanted to run , should have run earlier",2
Need 2015 maxwell vs aswin wc semis too ok happen for Punjab to have a chance today,3
Mayank injured too,6
"KXIP are honestly in a different league when it comes to screwing up games.

I've stopped laughing. Unable to cry",9
Mayank listen to batsman's call. It's his call,6
Maxwell better play the innings of his life to justify his position. Do some of the stuff he does in internationals,5
If Pooran wins this for KXIP we should write Nicholas Purana in his honor,3
"Lol lads punjab are just setting the stage up for another super over, can't clench victory from the Jaws of defeat if you aren't in a losing position first.",10
These instagram reels ads are so bad,2
Our batting has been shit. Our bowling is the best rn,2
Man why does agarwal get all the unfortunate outs.,3
Neeshgod coming in at 6,3
Maci show them how it's done! Show these guys a glimpse of your peak form today when your needa you the most,2
what time does the big show start?,1
Was it Pooran's call or Mayank's? I legit cant figure it,2
"Remember the 2014 opening game, the chase seened impossible? And then Maxwell happened..",7
That will help keep Ashwin off Mankad hopefully since he got a run out.,6
Now I've to watch this whole innings to find if I will get a redemption arc here.,1
"Pooran would be a good samurai with the way he commits seppukus

(Lmao I just realised it was Mayank)",6
"Haha, well, congrats DC. Hope you win the tournament as well.",3
"My team keeping their tradition of giving its fans a heart attack, only to push it to the last over alive and well.",2
"Today is best chance for Maxwell to prove his worth. RR is under control, he can take some time to settle in.",6
Thank God we played neesham today,5
Maybe today's the day Maxwell finally fires?,3
I think Punjab are playing the game as super over.,6
Doesn't matter whether there was a run there or not. Mayank clearly yelled no still pooran kept running and then he sacrificed his wicket.,6
They just need to play sensibly. It’s not a big target.,3
Good we have Neesham and Hooda Today,9
Another team bites the dust...,1
Maxwell behnchod aaj toh khel de,5
Ashwin has bowled wonderfully in this IPL. India will have a tough time to choose 2nd spinner.,6
Limped his way to the dugout LMAO,-1
Ashwin is a snake,4
Cmon Maxwel!,2
I swear Rabada comes on and bowls a wide every match.,3
Good throw by Ashwin there,3
Maxwell 7(11) or 70\*(31),7
Punjab with 420IQ to play Neesham,4
"Maxi, play conservative against Rabada for gods sake and drop it against spinners in the mids.",2
Pooran better score his quota of runs as well as Mayank's quota.,3
There was a single there,6
A troll to these grounds after IPL and once can see all these stuck bats in the ground serving as a memoir for all those runout victims.,2
Why did they send out a bowler this early,3
I will be very surprised if Maxwell survives this over from Rabada.,4
This is how Punjab lost against us,3
"999 is not ashwins jersey number,its his power level.",8
Maxwell masterclass incoming,6
"This is the best climax setup to complete the Maxwell redemption arc this season

Come on Maxi !!! We believe in you",12
"So Maxwell stands wide of the crease, the bowler bowls at his legs, he shuffles, and that’s a wide?",7
"“That’s 4.. Just a 1.”

“2”",7
Bro imagine Shaw not being a total fucking deadweight. Imagine a consistent 30-50 runs at a 160+ strike rate. We would be OP,8
It's fucking 7 rpo from now just play singles and doubles and they will get the odd boundary. Similar to Smith and Butler yesterday!,14
This is Maxwell's make or break innings.,11
This is your chance to bet good money on KXIP with great odds and lose your hard-earned money.,4
How is it on Pooran? It's an easy single and batsman called it,2
"[Me before Tushar's over](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkYtuwDUwAAqnZh?format=jpg&name=small)

Me rn: *Insert the recent kohli dancing clip*",3
Punjab have a strong batting line up. Need to chase this down,0
Maxi and neesham gonna win this one for kxip. Looks like a great set up for this kind of script and maxi is not looking jittery today.,1
"That was definitely a tight run and confusion but it was the strikers call and Manyank had to respond. He didn't and got run out, so in the end much of the blame is on him (though Pooran isn't totally blameless as well)",4
I'm surprised by that throw from Ashwin lol,1
"""Can you imagine if Pooran and Maxwell gets going after Rahul and Mayank have batted"" - Harsha Bhogle (2019)",5
Every bowler in DC is an attacking wicket taking one. Reminiscent of peak Aussies.,2
Maybe the sight of Daniel Sams will trick Maxi into thinking this is the BBL and he'll actually play competently,8
Remember when Ashwin vs Maxwell used to be so hyped in 2014 IPL.,5
Poor Neesham can't get a batting spot above the specialist fielder,6
Maxwell Mastapiece today???,3
Time for KXIP's overseas pros to finally show their worth.,2
KXIP is wasting no time today. Maybe finishing up this match earlier to compensate for taking too much time last match.,6
Why did Maxwell change his stance? Does anyone know?,2
"Wouldn't mind a repeat of this to be honest. Watch till the end for the weird celebration from Ashwin -


https://www.iplt20.com/video/18751/m59-kxip-vs-csk-glenn-maxwell-wicket",2
"This is your maxi , just prove yourself",1
Maxi special coming up.... I can feel it,1
Come on Maxi!!!,1
"That was a good call by Pooran, and as Sanga said it was his call. Also mayank started to run, he shouldn’t have hesitated.",5
I will get crazily downvoted but I feel Maxwell is going to play well today,5
KXIP only plays to entertain the audience,5
"Take good rest mayank, hope you destroy Australia in December",3
Mayank runout thrice this season lmao,3
"WTF Maxwell @ 100 SR 

sight to behold!",2
Put 2 Ashwin jerseys side by side and it will look like the 999999 in 1 video game cartridges from the 90s,3
"Both of them just need to bat thru. Nothing over the top needed. If Maxwell is ever gonna play well, this is the game to do so.",2
"Is this the thickest matchup? Pooran, Guy with frosted hair whos name i cant remember, Pant and Gayles bitch are all painfully thicc",6
Maxwell looks gold whenever he plays proper cricket.,3
"F*ck opposition, KXI is planning to chase down 200 this match",1
Only bowler I was scared of today. Ashwin. And he did it.,3
Openers were bound to fail sometime. Law of averages. Still backing Kings to chase this. Maxi masterclass 52\*(45) incoming.,4
This does seem perfect for Maxi redemption arc.,2
See how that works mayank.,2
Nick?,2
"Drop Shaw, get some Indian player in middle order and let Stoinis Open please",1
Where’s Binga?,2
"Mayank Tim saaf Dil aadmi ho, I will envy that",7
Everyone clapping when Maxi takes singles 😂 every run is a bonus at this point,9
With the quality of DC bowling both max and nic have to bat out of their skins for Punjab to even get close .,11
KXIP need to win to keep the league interesting,8
107 from 84 balls seems gettable. Just need one good partnership like buttler and smith did yesterday.,8
"I dont think DC can even hold on to Ash beyond next auction. They have too many youngsters to hold on to. I expect Iyer, Pant, Rabada, Nortje, Shaw/Dhawan? and many be Axar rather than Ash. So CSK better get him back as captain of the team for few years. He has stayed fit and so can play longer. Plus he just plays long form and IPL. That helps in sustaining.",1
"Looks like the youngster that does not have ""spark"" is number 5 in the most valuable list",6
Ashwin is such a good supporter in any bowling line-up. Don't know why CSK let him go. Also KXIP put lots of faith in him by making captain which is also not his forte.,8
Why isnt the quiche unleashed yet?,3
Okay. I want Maxwell to find form and also DC to win. Is it too much to ask?,9
KL sitting there nervously clapping every single.,10
BC review it!,3
r/cricket can jinx the sun to rise from the west but not Maxwell to bat well,21
"U get mayank-rahul best batting pair of ipl out, u also get a firing gayle out

Then u have pooran n maxwell on crease with neesham n hooda to follow

On paper this is the best batting lineup any team has fielded ever in ipl history. Period.",11
Pooran has run out a lot of his batting partners this season.,2
Lots of hopes on Nicky p here.,2
Gayle died for this...,4
Man it's about time Maxi wins a match for KXIP. They desperately need it.,7
"Pant

Dhawan 

Mayank

Hardik

Arshdeep 

Pooran

Cummins 

Bolt",2
"Gayle vs Ashwin in IPL:

51 runs

61 balls

Avg 10.2

SR 83.61",4
"Pooran looks guilty for that run out

For the time being focus on getting ur team across the line",9
Pooran Poor Run lmao,8
Neesh will see Aakash Chopra's face in Rabada today,3
"This is why KL should play in ""strike rate is overrated mode"" ffs",13
Great attacking captaincy,2
"3 Biggest Booty in Cricket: 

1. Heytmyer
2. Pant
3. Finch",18
Mayank is such a likable bloke.,9
haha poor ran,6
"Idk why but I feel like KXIP aren't gonna fuck this up like before 
 
Plus Maxwell has a pretty good record against Ashwin",4
"That was a POOR-RUN.
Haha, nice one from Dugout",9
I will bowl Rabada another over here! We need these two out.,2
Jimmy 'slick hair' neesham,7
Neesham looking calm and collected as usual,5
Why did R ashwin leave punjab?,3
Daniel christian + Sam Curran = Daniel Sams,7
Neesham face reminds me of Corey Anderson.And then 2014 match... Ah those days,1
Deepak Hooda can bat?? He is a batsman ffs that’s his job,8
I'm literally more scared of ash than rabada,2
We find one or other way to take it to the deep or screw it.,1
"Can pooran run a poor run?

Mayank : Yes",7
Our own Redditor can be the dream 11 game changer today,3
"I know expectations are high on Maxwell (and rightly so), but please for the love of IPL gods, get 40(40) atleast",3
This thread and r/cricket will collectively come tonight if we manage to meme Maxwell to power KXIP to victory.,7
Maxwell redemption arc incoming.,3
Maxwell has to perform in this game. KXIP has shown too much of faith in him & now it’s his time to pay back,2
Wicket alert,1
neesham hitting the winning runs and akash back to twitter.,5
I miss gimmicks like mongoose bat,2
"Forget Deshpande. Bowl him 16, 18, and 20 if needed.",2
"Maxi vs ashwin??

Only if it were 2014",5
Holy! Man! Can we do something about that blaring horn sound in background.,2
I still feel like we gonna lose for some reason.,1
I want to see neesham bat.,2
Every kxip fan made a Neesham style poker face at that run out,2
Pooran knows only gear to bat,2
Dugout is just a bug bruh moment.,2
How quick are Nicky P's feet? Wtf,1
hate myself for laughing at the dugout’s pooran puns,3
Ash vs Max,1
In school I had a friend named Mayank Agarwal. Used to call him monkey. Would that be racist in 2020?,3
Tewetia was tailor made for chaotic KXIP world. We need to fix this next season.,2
Maxwell and Pooran just need to do what Smith and Buttler did last night. Big ground with loads of singles and doubles. Uncomplicated cricket from two international players isn't too much to ask.,3
"Taxi , Dadar chalega kya?",1
That was Poor-fect. Dugout keeps on giving !,3
"They need just more than run-a-ball. Please play it safe and score 6 per over for the next 10 overs with occasional 8-10 and they'll reach something like 45 of 30. Then, they do these crazy running or big shots.",1
"Punjab should win this with Neesham coming in next but knowing it's Punjab, there will be drama or epic fail at the end.",3
This is going to the super over isn't it,6
KXIP fans have been least toxic to Maxwell through all these years of his poor run of form. Great day to payback their love ❤️,4
This approach by Pooran is the best suited approach for Pant.,3
That 26 over has really helped KXIP here. They can take their time now,4
Lol Maxwell still edging it,2
KG wants to support our boy maxi,4
I want to see Sams take wickets economically but I also want Maxi to wintl this for Punjab,3
KXIP turning around a top order failure into a win would definitely be a glorious rise of the pheonikx,4
We are such a poor fielding side lol.,3
Maxwell and Pooran have the ability to do what Buttler and Smith did last night. International players that have the potential to drive you home.,1
Fielding has been highest quality this ipl?,7
That’s out if not a bat.,1
Tbh I don't think Maxwell's stance is suited for T20. It worked in ODI cause he can be patient and pick a ball he's comfortable to hit but in T20 his off side has been very restricted.,2
Wtf Pant lmao,2
Phew that was close,5
Wow I just laughed OUT LOUD,3
Pooran's mistimed slog to to get out seems inevitable,3
Swann’s savagery on dugout is unmatched,9
Wtf is happening lmao,3
Yeah now this is a kxip match,7
MOTHERFUCK what is going on,3
What the hell this guy smokes.,4
"Maxwell calls the same way as I remember from EA Cricket 07. 

""Yeah yeah""",5
almost a poorun!,6
Wtf is PooRun doing,4
WTF ARE YOU DOING POORAN!!!,4
De Pant just said Fuck fuck fuck ? Lolll,4
Pooran don't wanna face Ash,6

"Pooran, for fuck's sakes, run properly.",9
This is getting ridiculous now,5
POORAN YOU DUMBFUCK,8
What the fuck Pooran?,11
Pant will be shat at for this but that was a bad throw,9
My fucking god we are a joke,6
Kya bc,2
Pooran wtf are u doing,5
did he just say the fielding has been of the highest quality immediately after a fielder let a ball gently roll through them almost to the boundary?,3
Could have been out,2
Poo ran out,2
I love mix-ups like this.,5
Pant tried to pull a rahul,11
Pant needs to be calm behind the wickets.,7
🤡,5
Ashwin to mar hi daalega,5
Fucking stop taking singles Pooran. Wait for Axar and tonk ffs,2
Pant never do a Dhoni man. It doesn’t work for you!,4
Pooran needs to calm the f down,3
Gayle not running is better than pooran running,5
Pant you idiot. Style marna zaruri hai kya BC,3
These two need to bat together till the 16/17th over w/o worry about the RRR.,1
Pant-ies in a twist,3
Haha dugout. Poor run,2
Village cricket from both sides.,2
Swann bantz on dugout are something else 😂,1
Pooran is a shit tier runner.,2
Pooran's name loosely translates to Poor run,3
Bhosdike,2
wtf is going on. Even RCB in those meme years doesn't play like this,2
I think ball bounced off the stump,2
Is it just me or Risabh is just too unreliable for tricky moments? He can still develop tho. Time's on his side,6
Kxip - We'll make the match interesting enough.,2
Ashwin is bowling at just the right speed this innings. He looks like a different bowler this IPL.,3
Maxi is no Mayank :),3
Lucky lucky lucky,3
"Another poor-run, lmao",3
KXIP trying to choke so hard.,1
Lmao Pant that is shithouse,1
Pooran to bowlers : wicket mai le leta hu aap dream 11 pe team bana lo,17
Pant ain't no msd,5
Pant is no KL behind the wicket,4
Why is Pooran so antsy?,1
Pooran teri maa ki pooriya,3
Terrible throw Iyer,1
WTF is this match,2
KL would’ve got that,1
"At this point, with the start the KXIP have. To win the game, they need only to play sensible cricket.

But since when have KXIP played sensibly, should make for an interesting finish to the game.",4
"Swanny playing the Pooran ""Poor Run"" joke lol",2
Shreyas' reaction was hilarious,3
Pooran needs to calm the F down,1
POORAN.. *nah* POOR RUN!!,3
Pant had plenty of time. That was a shit move,4
That was such a stupid move form Pooran and Pant,3
windies need to get Pooran in test cricket. He should learn how to build innings. Shades of AB in him definitely,4
Pooran seems sus,4
Dat one was on pooran,1
"&#x200B;

Pant has disappointed Shreyas and let him down :)",0
He had absolutely no idea where the stumps were lmao,2
Could've done with a better throw. Can't really blame Pant there.,2
"Dude that run out was honestly on mayank. The single was on, Pooran would be running to the danger end...why wouldnt Mayank listen to Poorans call? Its literally Poorans call to make",7
Poorunout,3
Pooran desperately trying to commit sudoku,2
It’s still Punjab’s game to lose,0
"Take a timeout to knock some sense into this guy, Jesus fucking Christ",3
"I'm seating on edge of my seat, and eagerly waiting to see how  Maxwell will shit the bed again. Riveting stuff",1
Where’s the strategic timeout when u need one. Pooran needs to take a step back .,1
Sanju would have got that wicket.,2
"Punjab fans, how many heart attacks did you have uptil now? Collectively?",2
LoL pant fail: trying to do a Rahul throw...,1
Poor ran ?,3
Nicholas Poor-run lmao,2
"ya'all need Jesus, curb your anxiety",1

"Comedy of errors, Pant missing from so close to the stumps, if Pooran was out there, KXIP were dead and buried.",3
Not Pant's fault. Shit throw,5
"Horrible, trash tier throw",1
Weak ass captaincy to get another over out of Deshpande instead of attacking with Rabada.,1
Well hopefully Tushar hasnt recovered from the last over,4
[deleted],4
Lmao is pooran match fixing,3
Pant tum Gulabjamun khao bus.,7
Maxwell’s stance is like /\,6
Pooran high on Ramdev’s chooran.,3
Take strategic time out and tell pooran to calm the fuck down,3
It's incredible how much more entertaining meme cricket is than genuinely good cricket,3
Miss those days when Maxwell reverse swept Ashwin for sixes,2
Pooran doesn't wanna be in his crease lol,3
Gonna try this position with my gf today using... SCORE,2
Shaw looking at his hands blaming them for that dumbass throw lmao,6
"FFS guys, that was a poor throw. Stop blaming Pant",3
Pant be throwing the ball he already caught.,1
"Maxi's stance scares me

Imagine a toe crushing Yorker, how will he defend that?",3
Maxwell is looking good today. Is this the silence before a storm?,2
Bruh WHY IS POORAN SO NERVOUS,5
BC Shaw can’t even throw now lol.,5
Pray for Maxwell to return to form 🙏🤲🛐✝️,4
Ben McDermott taught Pooran how to run between the wickets,5
Pooran really don't want to face Ashwin lol,3
Lazy Pant. Get behind the bloody line of the ball .,0
Pooran is suicidal running personified,3
Nice throw by the old man,1
Pooran inspired by Jordan's running between the wickets in the last game.,5
Timeout much needed now😂😂👍🏽,3
Shaw has to be the worst young fielders ever,7
All the potential Dhoni replacements keep one upping each other to make sure Rahul just keeps the gloves as long as possible.,5
maxwell's stance gives me anxiety,4
Very Chanderpaulesque stance from Maxwell,3
"Rabada: Physical form that people into their early 20s want to be in

Prithvi Shaw is curious case of Benjamin button dude,2

Great! Maxwell is gonna scream NO after every single now,3
What a shot that was.. no words,1
"Why are KXIP making this chase seem as if they are chasing 200+. The run rate is well under control, all they need is a little temperament.",5
That was fucking beautiful,0
Tushar is unlucky with West indies lol,6
Shaw needs syrup...*coughs,6
Deshperate move,3
Pooran is a bad imposter.,1
more of this and none of that please,2
At least they are attacking the weak link,3
SHOT!,3
Tushar showing signs of unadkat...,1
Why the fuck are we bowling Tushar again.. make Stoinis bowl his overs.. ridiculous captaincy,3
"Tushar: Look at me, I'm the Umesh now",2

What a shot pooran,2
One of the best pulls I've seen probably,1
Can these morons play a normal match for once?,3
"Before discarding Deshpande, this is still a young player and is a work in progress",7
Don't be a meme team man ffs,2
"Unacademy cracking Six? 
Is it just me or Yes Bank Maximum sounded just way too good?",3
Ball was a fly. Bat was a swatter.,1
Left handers are always fun to watch,1
Pooran is going to be such a great batsman when he fixes all the small issues he has. He already is but the potential is fucking insane,7
"Super over today, got a sneaky feelin'",1
Oof! Tushar’s honeymoon is over,2
Why is tushar bowling short so much. Literally everything has gone to the boundary,5
Deshpande giving half of the runs for KXIP,1
That is the end of tushar's career,2
Swann and co. are really grilling Maxwell in the dugout,4
Dropped by Pant,2
OMG SO CLOSE,1
Tough chance,2
why are these guys acting like they're chasing 200?,2
Tushar will never go on a holiday in West Indies,4
"DC have tried their level best to negate Shikhar's performance so far ,but KXIP won't let that happen that easily",2
Nice one. Poor-run should attack Tushar and play out Ashwin.,3
Entertaining af match 😅,8
Tamil commentators comparing pooran to Lara but i see Gilchrist,6
Pant was standing as a first slip lol,6
Luck favouring Punjab,3
Horrible day for Tushar,3

Ffs pooran... Don't u want preity's hugs??,1
"Jesus, that was close.",1
This does no favours for deshpande's confidence,2
[DC fans to Tushar](https://imgur.com/a/vhDzTt3),2
Pooran ans Maxwell would be the last two players we can expect to play sensibly and take Kings XI across the line. Pooran has no patience and Maxi simply not there this season,2
Tushar not having a good Mangalvaar,2
Pooran going for the win plus the NRR.,4
Pant is on rare form today 👌,3
Tyagi>deshpanda?,2
This guy is fast.,1
Omg that was a good ball by Deshpande! Such drama in this match so far!,6
Not Tushar's day at all,4
Quentin would have gotten that,1
Every ball is a heart attack with this team,7
Pooran pure chutiye ho gye ho ka,1
Pooran needs to calm down here,5
Pant would have caught that,2
So many people's heartbeats are going fast right now😅😂,3
You guys reckon Carry would've caught that?,1
"Haha, thank you fucking Pant 👖!",2
Nice six but Maxi should take strike and defend until Poorans cocaine wears off,15
Pant too slow,2
Pant. What a sleeper(keeper).,2
"Okay I didnt wanna hate on Anjum, but is she blind or what how did Pant mess that runout?",4

Pant Gravity loves you too much you dessert lover.,2
Lol. Shaw can’t run to save his life.,7
Poor tushar,3
"Welcome to dinda academy,Deshpanda.",2
Ofc it was Shaw after the ball... It had 4 written all over it,2
I have important meeting tomorrow. And this is looking like another super over finish.,7
Prithvi is a shit fielder,4
Just want Harshal back smh,2
Was stoinis crying lol,3
Deshpande being spanked,4
This catch was actually tough nice try Pant,10
Bruh Shaw 😂😂,13
why tf is shaw on boundary,6
"Swanny: "" If you're from Tushar's family, please don't look at his figures rn""",10
Pant has gotten fat enough for his own good. He is becoming a liability in this game,6
Short ball... FFS Tushar. Hadd chutiyapa hai,0
Lmao at Shaw lol,7
What is shaw doing on the field lol,8
Just 1-2 wickets and we gucci,3
That maneuvre cost Shaw 2 kgs,27
Pant giving vibes of young inzi,6
Why are commentators talking like that was Pant’s fault lmao,10
I am assuming Pooran can only bat in one mode,7
Didn't anyone taught Tushar how to pitch the ball up? This is shit bowling.,0
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ That dive,6
Why do they hate this boi? 🤕,6
Pant has to work on his fitness. He looks to be a bit slow and chubby now,9
10 bucks says Deshpande's most hated country is WI rn,10
Prithwi Shaw should be dropped just for his abhorrent fielding. WTF was that,3
Poor Tushar,3
BC why are you bowling Tushar and not attacking with Rabada. Why is Iyer such a stupid captain!!,1
Shaw fell at the end as if someone shot him,10
Now all we need here is few big shots from big show,1
Why is Shaw in the deep at all?,3
Was Stoinis crying lol?,4
Shaw uncle😂😂,8
So the RR is never gonna be problem for KXIP. Just need to get those partnerships in the middle order more often,3
41 from 2 overs YIIIIKKKKKEEEESSSS,5
Prithvi Shaw is the oldest 20years old I have ever seen,26
I doubt shaw and pant pass the yo yo test,6
Tushar gave 41 in just 2 overs wow,8
0-41 in 2 overs. Mate mate mate,6
"""Least athletic dive ive seen in the IPL"" LMAO couldnt agree more",23
Tushar seems like a very generous person,5
"KXIP in overdrive atm, they will cruise through with 3 overs left or choke again and lose",9
Tushar not having a great day,6
Shaw's fielding is something even r/cricket can't reverse jinx.,6
I knew it was four the moment Shaw appeared in frame,11
Ravi shashtri lite ain't sprinting on straight line,3
That dive by Prithvi was shaw funny,7
Tushar about to score the fastest 50 this season,7
Lovely seam position,1
Tushar getting smashed all the way to gulli cricket,1
[deleted],12
Should've got smacked by that ball on the face for that fielding effort.,3
Shaw putting in a dive to show intent while fielding,7
Shaw is like here let my shoulder get damaged,5
"Tushar, after giving away 41 runs in 2 over, takes his mask off -

**Jordan** - IT WAS ME ALL ALONG!",6
Deshpanda making sure that he scores 50 before the batsmen,1
Kxip innings looking like extended highlights,7
Deshpande going to be the 2nd centurion today,7
Earthboy is like sabhi mere taraf hi marte hai.,3
Gayle destroyed Tushar's confidence. Big time,14
CMON MAXI . WE BELIEVE IN YOU,4
Punjab's game to lose,3
If you told me Prithvi Shaw is 2 weeks away from his 37th birthday I'd believe it,20
Neither of those were Pants fault,4
There is no excuse for being above 15% body fat as an athlete in these times. And Pant looks like he is well above 20,7
"""That's the least athletic dive I have ever seen.""

Man Swann is sparing no one tonight",12
Shaw Lmao,10
"Both Gayle and Pooran are in great touch. Gayle threw his wicket away and I hope Pooran takes KXP home today. Chase looks easy unless they mess it up. 

&#x200B;

Pant needs to get fitter. He should have ran out Pooran despite poor throw from Dhawan. I hope they dont consider him as test match keeper.",4
Shaw needs to completely overhaul his fitness,3
Kumble please give Pooran an earful. Wtf is he doing.,3
Shaw needs some tonic(Steroids),4
"Without tushar's overs

46(42)",7
Prithvi shaw adding to the comedy show. Diving after the ball reaches the boundary.,4
Swann's strategic timeout call outs are the best thing,3
Lmao the shit Swann is allowed to get away with. Poor Harsha got fired for nothing.,3
Pooran has to be the craziest player in t20 cricket currently,1
"Tushar, tushar, tushar.

&#x200B;

Oh dear, I feel that this is going to shatter the young mans confidence. Not great captaincy by Iyer, it's cleat that the poor chap isn't having the best day.",3
Ravi Shastri right now might be a better fielder than Jr Shastri aka Shaw,6
Swann's so random. Brilliantly random might i add,3
Shaw😆😂,1
Legend has it that Prithvi Shaw drives lorries when he doesn’t play cricket to make ends meet,10
That wasn't Pant's catch. Hope he's not blamed for it.,4
[Tushar Deshpande](https://indianmemetemplates.com/storage/hum-koi-mandir-ka-ghanta-hai-ki-koi-bhi-aake-baja-jaata-hai.jpg),6
Shaw literally wanted to hug the boundary line more than stop the ball,3
"I'm gonna go on a limb and say , my boy Pant isn't a 100 percent. 

That actually terrifies me cos we have a long ass Australian tour coming and he's gotta keep for 4 tests all over.",1
BC 2 over 41 runs. :D,4
Pooran does not want to face Ashwin at all.,2
Come on Maxwell. I am rooting for you,1
Tushar has been bribed by KXIP,2
Pant is the Kamran Akmal of India lol,0
RR did the same thing. They were too aggressive and lost the plot. Punjab is following in the same footsteps,3
[deleted],2
"Shaw, LMAO! The Jadhav scooter was definitely faster!",5
Poor guy has given away almost half of the total runs scored in just 2 overs. Would have been some consolation if Pant had taken that catch,2
Literally all Maxwell has to do is hang in there and not go crazy. This target does not DEMAND crazy. Just good ol' cricket shots like Shikhar.,4
"
Is there any specific reason why a no-ball is penalised with a free hit but a wide isn't? for me the free hit is a rather silly rule and while it does add some excitement in a game it does feel like a rule that kids made up playing gully cricket",4
"""That's the least athletic dive I've ever seen in my life... but I love that he's gone for it""

Swanny giveth, after he taketh away",5
Shaw always looks like he is pretending to do good.,6
Prithvi Shaw about to become another Unmukt Chand,3
Post match Iyer: I was banking on my fast bowler Tushar but he didn't turn up right,3
"Pooran and Maxwell need to take this a little deeper. Don't go boundaries galore. 

Pooran please keep your cool.",3
Someone please tell Pooran that we need just need 7 per over. Singles will do the magic and no need for this drama. Making me anxious.,1
Please bowl Stoinis over Tushar. Even Shreyas would do.,1
Shaw nearly lost his teef,1
RRR is very manageable. Now don't get out trying to hit everything. Keep calm and see the team through.,2
Hope DC bring Axar on vs Pooran 🙏,2
"Gayle pooran maxwell Neesham . This is madness. 

Is this the first time any ipl team has played 4 overseas batsman?",3
Pollard is the only West Indian I have seen play according to the situation of the match,7
Tushar has given 41 from 2 overs while the rest of DC have given 46 from 7 overs,3
Only Yo-Yo test Pant/Shaw pass is on the DC Buffet table.,5
"Holy shit this why KXIP are exciting. BATSHIT crazy batters, edge of ur seat stuff. It's either a fast tracked win or a collapse or slow journey towards death. No wonder KL wants to anchor them hard.",9
Kohli please give your nutritionist's and trainer's number to Shaw.,7
Earthboy looks out of shape ... Swallowed some more pills ??,5
"Lol, and people claim Pant is a better wicketkeeper than Rahul.",3
Shaw and Pant really need to work on their fitness,4
Shaw is unfit simple as. Work on your fitness you are a professional player ffs.,4
Deshpande experiment needs to stop. Yes he is fast but Harshal too can bowl 140 here and there and is more effect because of his variations. He needs to come back in the team. Middle overs are leaking without him.,2
Tushra looking to beat Dindas 60 in 4 overs and inaugurate the Deshpande academy of bowlers,5
Fun fact :- Kartik tyagi has more wickets than navdeep saini this season,5
"46-3 off 7 overs off other bowlers


41-0 off Tushar's 2 overs.


Really taking the pressure of this chase.",6
"Bois we winning this ! Ain't nothin to worry 

We move up form here .",4
"I am not even kidding when I say Shaw should be made a Murga, guy is talented but it looks like he is taking it casually",5
Kxip misread it as 265 lmao,4
Is this tushar first game or something?,2
"With Iyer's blessings, Tushar can break the record of highest runs conceeded by a bowler in a match in IPL",6
KXIP matches are a must watch,7
"Man, all this team has is aggressive batsmen. This team needs a Joe Root type player in the middle order. I hope we get Steve Smith in the auction if RR don't retain him",5
Mayank runout thrice this season lmao,6
How difficult it would be to hire a personal trainer for Shaw? He needs it.,3
All these S20 FE ads. Does Samsung not realise that the S20+ is selling cheaper than the FE? (Probably not for long though),0
Delhi minus Tushar has given away 46 in 7 overs. One of those days for Tushar,6
Mayank could have saved his wicket but he saved Pooran's. Hope it pays off,6
Probably the worst pair for when the target is a run a ball haha,7
I will do a kadi ninda if Shaw ever gets selected in the Indian team before he improves his fitness and fielding. Can’t have that shite at the international levels.,8
[deleted],6
Gayle and Pooran have broken the back of this run chase. Punjab can play tuk tuk risk free and easily finish this game,9
Give Shaw some of those cough syrup.,3
[removed],7
"Gayle at top, Pooran in middle & Pollard to finish


Windies coming out Strong!",3
Pooran is a different breed of player don't know who else plays like this in middle overs maybe his current batting partner.,9
"16 overs chase or COLLAPSE, no in between",8
"Lol I just read a headline ""Arnab Goswami writes to the President of India""",6
Lenskart have set their eyes on their next brand ambassador - Nicholas Pooran,5
KL and Mayank gone. If Maxwell fails today they're gonna turn on him,2
the hate boner for Pant in here is wild. Not many keepers in the world would take an inside edge after been wrong footed like that. Y'all need to chill,2
Pooran could either smash Stoinis or get out to him,2
Stoinis was booted from RCB because he was better looking than Koach /s,5
Post-Match Iyer: Tushar let me down today.,3
Someone tell them that the target is 160 not 260,5
Shaw making up for Mishraji's absence from the team.,2
pant needs a rocky training montage to get fit.,4
Mayank should stop running away from responsibility by getting run-out,-1
Shaw and Pant future of India isn't as fit as Old Dhoni.,3
Gayle killed the game. MoM contender already.,3
When will people understand that they just can't drop batsmen like Dre rus and maxi just because they had few bad games.,2
Prithvi Shaw doing the best impression of Indian uncles. Dude looks beat and old.,5
Tushar will never visit West Indies,6
"Kohli

ABDV

Chahal 

mOrRiS",2
Have a feeling kxip will bottle this like rr did,3
"Ffs Maxwell hasn't hit a six this IPL after facing 71 balls.

Guy was legit flicking his 3rd ball for six off Archer before the IPL.",11
Hotstar such sellouts. They stopped having gyan specials during timeouts. Fuck!,6
Why is Axar not bowling,3
"Maxi scored double digits, I’m happy.",4
"Bad day for Tushar, that Pooran wicket really could've changed the tide towards DC.",2
What’s Swann on?,2
Looks like Tushar Is NoT sHoWiNg SpArK,6
"Looking at Deshpande, Ishant's absence is already being felt even before start of Aus tour 😭😂😭😂",2
Damn RRR is 7. KXIP to lose now,1
If only Shaw left the field instead of clutch fielder Dhawan,1
Is Maxwell stance has to do something with his awful returns this year ??,1
"RR is around 7 rn.

If KXip bottle this, then they donot deserve the top 4 simple as that",2
"10D chess by punjab. you cant choke in the last over, if you dont get to the last over",5
"Tushar with heavenly counts of 2-0-41-0

Thampi sweating on if he'll lose his record",2
"On a serious note, why did Maxwell change his batting stance? What advantage does this new stance give him?",1
Smooth action from zampas daddy,1
"Nicholas Pooran showing intent, like other Punjab batsmen today👏🏽👏🏽✌🏽",1
Pooran bruh,1
Pooran is in Rohit after running out Kohli mode.,3
"For pooran it's either boundary or wicket, pure entertainer",12
"Dhawan looks worried , 100 looks to be going in vain.",5
Pooran has no chill,2
Pooran snorted coke before going out to bat. He is hella high,4
Pooran is hell bent on unfucking the Mayank run out,8
Hooda is SRH discard... imaging taking him in your team and playing him in 11...,1
Pooran is a next gen talent. Brilliant,7
In the air but perfectly between the two fielders.,3
fuck me daddyy P,3
Pooran I love you but no need to hit every ball man,10
need a wicket rn,1
This man is LEGIT,8
maxi just needs to play the role Smithy played last night. Just get Pooran on strike,3
"BC Iyer and his captaincy makes no sense to me! Why bowl Stoinis here, match is going away. Bring back Rabada!",5
My man playing like he chasing 200.,13
Maxwell is still not out? I wonder why,5
"why ashwin and axar not bowling, iyer's fetish with righ/left hand effects",4
Mental player,3
Pooran deserves the hype around him. Believe the hype!,3
"What a shot , show them some Carribbean flavour boy!!!",4
Calm down Pooran 😲,3
Pooran - Fuck this shit I will not run anymore.,8
Pooran is on 🔥🔥,3
West Indies got a Gayle regen just as the original Gayle retired and he is an upgraded version.,6
Even a 46 year old Ponting would be a better captain than Iyer tbh,-1
At this rate they might win it with 4 overs remaining.,3
"Pooran, lad, that's disrespectful lmao",5
Pooran is what I wish Pant would have been today,8
Nicholas Pooran IS THE ENTIRE KXIP MIDDLE ORDER,5
Nicky p is the REALEST MF out there in da game!,5
"Jesus fuck Nicky, calm down. The target is 160 odd. You are the last batsman ffs",3
Pooran - what r u smoking? Jeez. What a clean striking,3
Who hurt Pooran lmao,6
Pooran is so exciting to watch until he gets out playing a rash shot,4
"Punjab team is burning with revenge, they wanna defeat all the big teams 😂😂👏🏽",8
Pooran gives 0 fucks,7
Wow pooran ...Just wow.,7
"Geez, KXIP lineup is so exciting this season. How the fuck did they manage to lose so many matches!!",8
"Shaw needs some syrup.


Body syrup.",7
Is there any condition to chase it down in 14 overs,7
"Fucking play axar,cowards.",6
"Honestly they should go a bit slow with the hitting, cant afford to lose their wicket.",4
dhoni going mad somewhere with the lack of spark.,9
This is how West Indians play! Pure entertainment!,7
Should've bowled out Rabada against Pooran. The game is gone now.,7
Pooran is getting to this target in a hurry.,8
Gayle needs to open and take advantage of the powerplay.,2
Who tf said the pitch was difficult,2
No Ashwin when he was bamboozling pooran.. brilliant captaincy,2
Fearless batsman,3
This match is really bringing about the laps in DC batting. Except Dhawan no one looked to get their foot in on a pitch where the ball is coming on nicely.,2
Nicky P what the fuck mate,3
Vintage stoinis,2
"Just get Rabada back on to break this, or it might be over by the time the death overs come around",2
DC really needing Nortje today,3
Pooran's shots are some of the most beautiful in the game,5
What are the other sports apart from Cricket where you could make the team even if you are much overweight?,2
Pooran has been such a gem for KXIP this season. Just need Maxi to not bat brain-dead today,7
This is why i fear west indies the most in international tournament. You don't get 50-50 from them. It is either this or that. Most often you are on the losing side.,7
"Reality Check for Delhi Today.

&#x200B;

Good to see Punjab finally winning some games. What a comeback it would be if they can make the knockouts.",6
Pooran in full flow is one of the best batsman to watch. Just so fucking stylish and extravagant,7
Calm down Pooran. This dude is giving me a heart attack. Seeing this after the match last night. Unbelievable,4
Haha funny joke dont test the tea theres nothing there shhh,3
"technically, he finished scoring Mayank's 35 runs. Now he needs to score for himself lol",9
Pitch looks like a road. Why the fuck were the other DD batsmen batting like they were playing for CSK?,5
"Fuck points table. The team that starts peaking now has a really good shot at the trophy.

I m really scared of this KXIP",7
NRR going down the shitter today,5
Pooran please calm down,6
Tushar = stoinis,3
Bruhh,2
guys stop reverse jinxing we wanna see punjab win,5
Pooran is a special bat,4
"How do buff dudes like stoinis, russel bowl so slow",6
I don't want to get carried away or anything but non super-over Nicholas Pooran is better than Bradman and Billy Beldham combined.,3
Iyer has cost us this match! 3 overs from the 5th bowler in the first 10 needlessly!,7
Pooran fucking DC.... *Thats gay af*,3
Iyer doing a Kohli impression with that captaincy.,6
Pooran is unnervingly comfortable while hitting 6s. It's almost too easy for him.,9
Doulley thinks it's Ganja,1
Maxwell just needs to support.,1
Pooran is a beast,1
"Am I the only who feels shots of Pooran are very very pleasant to eyes, only other I feel is ABD.",6
"Of any team capable of defending this, of any team capable of chasing this.",2
Most batsmen have gears. Pooran works in ludicrous mode,2
Pooran is a monster.,3
Fuck it no point holding Rabada now go all in,8
Come on man... 65 off 60.... No stress....,9
KXIP making my ₹399 hotstar subscription well worth it.,16
Pooran plays only in Gear 5,6
"Is pooran consciously playing for nrr

Or is he being pooran",9
Pls get a single for the satisfaction of 100 runs in 10 overs,1
Pooran is this generation's Gayle,3
Seems like both teams have identified that the 4 Tushar/Stoinis overs are key. Iyer tried to sneak them in when the partnership was building but Pooran had the guts (and incredible ability) to take them on and it’s worked out nicely for him,7
Pant being lazy.,2
"*Maxwell exists*

Simon Doull: Imma end this man's whole career",5
"Feel for Tushar, but he's getting the experience of how opposition teams are going to treat him given he's the most inexperienced guy in his team's bowling lineup",1
Pant is average keeper at best,5
It would be so KXIP to lose this from here.,7
Aww Pant is mad lmao,5
Stoinis just needs a warner moustache to be the biggest douche in cricket.,6
Looks like Harshal Patel will be back again then. Atleast he keeps it at ER of 10,6
Iyer saves the best bowlers for way too long,5
Punjab has taken an oath to defeat and humiliate all the top guns before going down😂😂,6
Scooby doo Gang: Let's see who's behind this mask. *unmasks Stoinis*.  Tushar!!,2
Let this be a lesson: we win despite Iyer’s captaincy!!,2
Punjab are 17 runs ahead. Which is great news because Delhi didn't really go gung ho at the end.,3
MF who is blowing vuvuzela in this empty stadium?,1
Kxip should keep going at 10RPO to get that holy NRR bounce,3
Maxi please go back to your original stance.,4
This batting order is mental,2
DC deserve to lose today's match because of this batting performance and terrible fielding. Only supporting them today so Dhawan's efforts don't go to waste.,4
"Come on DC. Gayle spanking you? Counter with Ashwin. Great.

Now Pooran spanking you? Counter with Rabada. There won't be a death to use him in otherwise.",7
Maxwell is like the least scary batsman in KXIP's top 5 imao.,10
"Yes perfect 100 at 10 overs

Edit: screw the wide",7
How long before everyone refuses singles batting with pooran,4
"Oh man,  Pant looks pissed!

It wasn't all your fault mate!",3
BC we're getting Pooran'ed,8
Why pooran is in so much hurry,5
Absolute scenes if KXIP botch this run chase to go to a superover.,3
"Kxip have looked a way better team than kkr this season, hope they somehow make it to the playoffs",6
Pooran is the next AB,5
"Formula to Win against Delhi- Bowl first Don't dismiss Dhawan, Then Let's Fucking Go in the 1-15 overs, then play slowly in the last five to win. Reccomended By- Mumbai Indians",8
Pant is not good enough as a batsman and not good enough as a keeper,5
Fuckers scored 100 in 10 overs.....and it's not even sharjah,8
"58 matches, 18 average, 860 something runs for the last five years. Yeah no doubt Maxi's IPL career is solely based on his reputation and not performance.",2
Congrats Maxi for tentury,7
Man this shit gonna fuck up our NRR,5
Absolute embarrassing bowling by Tushar. That pitch map tells me he's looking more like a back of a length bowler without the pace or swing.,3
Why the fuck is that a wide?,0
KXIP's resurgence has been quite something. Can't rule them out as a dark horse. So many batsmen capable of killing a game.,5
Absolute dogshit bowling by DC. Ponting better beat them with a belt after this match.,-3
Bhosdike Maxwell can't cash in on that slot ball,7
I somehow have bad feeling on this too 🤪😞,3
[removed],12
All of a sudden this batting looks so good.,3
ITT: 90% people complaining about shaw and pant fitness. Ffs we get it.,2
"I can guarantee with KXIP, it's not over yet.",0
Delhi are still in this if they get Pooran out pretty much now,2
Punjab's batsmen have scored so much ahead of the required rate now that even Dhoni and Jadhav can come in and finish this game,3
Lmao Maxwell not even in that poll says all you need really,2
Lol 106* 14 14 10,1
KXIP is the most entertaining team this season,3
This is some Pooran Porn stuff,1
surely they cant fuck it yp from here,1
"Guys, please pray for us. We promise to make every match interesting af, you can’t afford to have us out of this competition",6
KXIP has the best top 5 in the IPL... if Maxwell was in form.,5
"The faster something goes up, the faster it comes down. Now fearing for KXlP",2
"Hello CA guys, can you crunch some numbers and find the number of sixes hit by CSK terror boys.",2
"Maxwell, all I asking you to do is stay there. Don't do anything dumb. Nicky is going batshit and his wicket is imminent",3
Take a single maxwell. I wanna see axar vs pooran,5
Punjab is opposite CSK,1
Ohh boy I am looking forward to Axar vs Pooran,2
Bhag bsdk! *I've always wanted to do that.*,2
Bowl Rabada out now if you have any semblance of a brain in your head lol.,3
I’m sure this has been asked plenty but where is Nortje?,4
[Cricinfo had one job](https://i.imgur.com/VV6QcmH.png),2
poorans a torquey lad.,1
"Dehli are trying to restrict the scoring, but if Kings 11 can score more than them in twenty overs, they will win the game",3
Iyer's captaincy doesn't give any confidence it all depends on Pointing & team.,0
"So under normal conditions, the last 7 wickets of any team in the world - including the weakest professional cricket team you can think of (let's say, the team that came last in the Zimbabwe Premier League, if that was a thing) - should be able to get a run a ball. This is our game to lose and if we do lose, doesn't matter that we had close losses - we deserve our spot on the table.",3
All the Delhi fans are silent for some reason 🤔,2
"As an MI fan, it's a pleasure to see KXIP in such a form after an abysmal start.",8
Only way we lose this game is if Pooran goes reckless,1
Pooran doesn't probably want to wait for Rabada and Ashwin,3
Stoinis the bowler was on the same level as Siraj and Umesh last season.,2
"Fuck me, Punjab are going to storm into the playoffs aren't they? Might even win the whole thing with the momentum they generate.",7
Eagy eagy eagy,5
"if punjab manages into the playoffs,that will be real roar of the lion.",3
Why isn't Nortje playing today?,3
They probably had to sodomise Maxi into hitting singles only,9
KXIP batting line up is deadly,4
I just want to see maxwell hit a six,5
"Knowing Kxip this season, they will take it deep to the last over.",1
Dhoni was clearly talking about DC when he said the youngsters have lost their spark /s,5
Gayle looking old 😔,1
That's a chonk six!,5
Holy mother of Pooran,3
Easy easy easy,3
Winning is as overrated as strike rate.,3
Aunty Gayle.,2
THERES THE EASYEASYEASY,3
Pooran is a boundary or naught kinda player every ball. Can't help but think that he'd struggle the moment things start to not go his way.,2
Tbh good time for Maxi to come into form. Least pressure situation you're gonna get in a tournament like this,5
Who is best captain in IPL? They all kinda suck. Probs Rohit,4
Pooran got no chill,5
I will be surprised if this ain’t a 7 wicket win,5

I award 12 runs to Pooran for that shot.,5

Bringing in axar when pooran is on strike and inf form is big iq play by dehli,1
I won't be surprised if Axar is hit for more than two sixes this over.,2
Pooran always shows intent no matter what. Perfect t20 batsman,9
Tushar : *chuckles* I'm in danger,9
He fucking hit it in the third tier. Lmao.,6
The good thing is Maxwell is rotating the strike instead of playing reverse scoop which don't connect,4
lmao my stream is slow and yall are giving spoilers,4
Pooran NEVER holds back against left handers,5
Bangar is so bhangaar. Bloody ear sore,7
"It seems pooran want to fix nrr too, if we win this game",2
Match is over with 2 overs of purple cap holder Rabada left. Fuck Iyer!!,0
"Pooran hits a six then takes a single

Sunny cums",3
How can he hit like this,3
"I remember Axar getting tonked in a T20i in 2014-15, then Gavaskar said, ""why he's in team, he can't spin the ball as a spinner.""",1
"Who amongst you were called DC a ""settled side""?",2
Is Nortje injured?,3
Chirping behind the wicket is back,2
"Bruh , DC is my friend's fav team.when I said her that DC  is playing like shit,she replied saying that I cant criticize them because I dont play international cricket 🤡",7
"Gayle at 3 has helped KXIP. Lengthened their batting lineup. Given them ammo for super overs. His fear factor has helped.  
This is how you should bat when you're ageing. The approach should be the same...even if you're not scoring centuries anymore",1
Has anyone told Nicky P that they barely need a run a ball,5
[deleted],1
I have a feeling Maxwell is holing out this over.,1
"64 off 60. As Mourinho would say, 

PARK THE BUS!",5
"Just tuned back in and Punjab after beating MI is now being cut-throat on DC 

So KXIP is doing what people thought CSK would do after half season ?",8
pooran playing ea cricket 07 in VR.,8
Is Maxwell there so Punjab doesn't win too quickly?,5
There's no way you can win a match with your top batsman scoring 106 off 61 and the rest 58 of 59.,7
Pooran is what Sanju Samson should aspire to be,10
"In the end, the real cricket is friends they made along the way",9
"Maxwell just needs to do a thala here, that's it",9
I want Punjab in the top 4 tbh. I'm ok with either outcome,6
[removed],5
NET RUN RATE👍🏽,3
"I swear guys, it’s Maxi driving this partnership by not being an absolute idiot",8
"Pooran be like -

Baap ka, dada ka, bhai ka.. sabka badla lega re, tera faizal",10
Maxwell playing very sensibly here. Nice stuff when other batsman is controlling the hitting stuff,4
"If not KKR, would it be fair to say that KXIP have the highest chance to take the 4th spot? SRH NRR is still positive",6
At least Taxi is taking singles and keeping it moving.,6
Pooran being so chad that everyone forgot about maxi,3
Punjab is going for that sweet NRR,2
Why is the fake crowd noise getting more and more obnoxious the longer we go into the IPL? Who the fuck thought adding vuvuzelas was a good idea.,5
It's over.,3
Pooran making up for that wild run-out.,2
Kings XI gonna win the whole tournament LOL,2
Maxwell probably got the memo from Kumble before going into bat.,1
"Pooran has to keep the the ""KXIP matches are most entertaining theme"" but for the love of God, calma calma",2
KXIP going for NRR it seems,2
"164 was never going to be enough at Dubai. Too bad Dhawan's 100 might be in a losing cause, only if the rest had given him some support.",2
First saw Pooran when he could not connect a ball of that super over from Narine. What an absolute joy to watch him now! Would want to see him in tests too and give the team the much needed impetus at the back end of an innings.,2
bring in sams and Ash,1
STOP THIS VIRTUAL GUEST BOX FFS,3
Sanjay Bangar at dugout wants to roar like a tiger when someone hits a six but it comes out a wet cat. Sorry Sanjay.,9
Pooran is highly entertaining to watch.,3
Oh Pant you shouting Parrot..... perform or keep quiet.,2
"Found this gem on Rahul's Wikipedia 


>Lokesh, who was a fan of the cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, wanted to name his son after Gavaskar's, but mistook Rohan Gavaskar's name as Rahul.


Was supposed to be KL Rohan",6
Gayle’s cameo put them in a good position run rate wise and they just had to continue building on it. which they have done beautifully so far.,2
DC needs to keep Pooran off strike and focus on Maxwell. A few good balls and surely Maxwell will do what he does best.,2
Would be surprised to see deshpande get another game now,1
Gosh they got away with just 11 in that. Could've easily been 16-17,1
CSK fans would give an arm and a leg to have someone like Pooran in their team,1
"Man I remember when pant used to be like this in the ipl, now he’s just another tuk tuk bat",1
"Pooran changed completely after Kumble wanted to drop him for Gayle, no looking back",1
"Hard to believe Shaw, pant, hetmyer are in early 20s with those big asses",4
People in guilt often play outstanding innings.,3
[deleted],3
"Pooran hitting bowlers effortlessly:

Pant: *eazy eazy eazy*",7
"RR: mom can we have pooran 

mom: we have pooran at home

Pooran at home: david miller

Even though david miller is my favourite batsman",5
Bowl Rabada you dumb fucks!!,1
Collapse incoming,1
Maxwell doing an kohli noice.,2
Good one Maxi,1
Hope those vip fans are paid well for acting like clowns in front of the camera,2
was that the first 6 conceded by Axar this IPL?,1
Pooran hits it so cleanly. Good to see more classical batsmen from WI,6
Pooran knows they're going to choke so he's making the runs as fast as he can.,3
I don't see why KXIP fans have a problem Pooran trying his best to improve their NRR. Its worse than RCB and SRH rn which they could possibly be competing with for a playoff spot.,6
Maxwell is playing good so far. The situation he came in he’s just playing the anchor while Pooran goes berserk,8
Maxwell is rotating strike beautifully tho.,6
"Hooda out Mandeep in and we've got a super solid Batting and bowling order

I cant decide between Jordan and Neesham tbh, Jimmy did well today",3
Pooran afraid to run doubles. Atleast 3 of.them were doubles. But doesn't matter its better not it.get run out,3
Will Punjab give us a collapse and some drama tonight ?,2
I can't believe sensible batting from KXIP,3
[deleted],5
How much money would convince you to be on the virtual guest box?,6
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",0
"Match is gone for sure, the best hope is now to reduce the margin of defeat if delhi wants to be in the top 2",2
Kxip will take the 4th spot..the form they're in,4
"I see you, sitting in the stands with your small but energetic smile. I see you biting your nails nervously during the super overs. You wave the KXIP flag, but it's my heart that flutters.",0
"Changes stance

*Becomes shittier*",9
[deleted],3
Lol I'm still worried we won't win this.,1
Pooran is the second person I'll retain after KL Rahul,3
DC fucked up big time today. Atleast 30 runs short,4
Thanks for reminding everyone Pant,8
Love how people pretend they knew what was gonna happen all along after 75% of the match has finished,7
This is the most chaotic innings of the season so far. Big wickets but it hasn't stemmed the run rate at all,6
Pooran : I better finish this match before I run someone else out.,6
Ohh God not pant,7
"axar ko daalke mixer me
Pooran ne kiya uska chooran",3
I love these Pooran almost side on pulls.,2
"Aye Taxi, Dadar chal na.",2
I want a life size poster of Dhawan staring into my soul opposite to me bed.,2
Someone please get this one two many motherlovvers out of my head,2
Tushar out next game,1
"Ashwin bowling, don't try a quick run",1
"Delhi fans, ummm, where is Nokia? And why not bowling Rabada???",1
Listen to pant and get a wicket god damnit,5
lol I love Pant,5
Fuck yeah Pant 😂😂,8
Maxwell at least going for a reverse this over?,2
"With that stance, Maxwell can as well shit on the pitch itself. TBH, he hasn't disappointed either in the last few matches.",3
"*Pooran smacks a ball into the air*

Me: Kalm, it's going for six

*Pooran taps the ball for a quick single*

Me: Panik",8

"Batsman I enjoyed watching bat this IPL :
Jos
ABD
Kohli
Kanos
Pooran
Stoinis",4
I've missed pant's wicketkeeping,3
Easy easy easy easy,5
Pant is a great team player behind the stumps haha,4
Gayle and Pooran have 73 runs off 35 balls. 5 6s and 8 4s between them. Gayle vs Tushar changed the match.,6
Pant can be so annoying behind stumps.,10
Are bhai pant jara aaram se,9
Wow Maxi so watchful. You can literally see his neck moving with the ball lol.,3
Rohit Sharma did get two 200s after getting Kohli run out on the other end....guilt is a powerful emotion,6
WK hawking one wicket,2
Yeh Pant pehle sabji bechta tha kya,9
"Lot of balls that could be hit on the off side, Maxwell is squeezing on his leg side. His new stance seems to have made him somewhat restricted.",0
Someone please put a bat in Pant's mouth,11
"Rishabh Pant's ""CMON BOYS"" is so cute hahha",6

Motm Mayank Agarwal for a brilliant sacrifice,3
Just don't try sth new when ashwin is there.,3
"If only maxwell starts firing

Gayle

Pooran

Maxwell

Scariest middle order right now in any team",9
"I cany stop laughing at pant tbh, dunno how the batsmen are holding it in",10
All this happened cause boss smashed 26 in an over,9
Maxwell's current stance opens up so much legside space to take a single easily,1
Pant shouting 1 wicket 1 wicket like a vendor in a Sabzi Mandi,5
Mature umpire helps put rubber on Thicc young carribean mans LONG handle,5
No more 2s,1
The strap on Pant's helmet isn't on properly. Tut tut,1
"As an SRH supporters, I feel absolutely jealous that other teams have middle order batsmen who can bat..",8
It's nice that even if it's only a single... Maxwell takes the first run quickly.,1
"Pooran may throw wicket this over , he shd b probably cool this , ashwin is bowling too good",1
Ayo Lemme see the face of Ricky p now.,2
Pooran through to pant... much like the runs I had earlier (honest),2
How are we no 1 in fair play with polly in our team???,1
MaZwell keep rotating strike,2
"pooran for all the power he has got, he could make an excellent feather weight southpaw boxer.",2
This is probably the most chaotic chase I have seen this season.,1
Bruh Mumbai even trying to win the fair play award,1
Something tells me there is gonna be a twist in the tale. This is going way too smooth by Punjab standards,4
This will open up Delhi's eyes,2
Pant shouting more than a street vendor,3
Been watching few DC matches this IPL . Someone needs to tell DC coaches that not all 20 year olds are agile and fit enough to field near the boundary. 34 year old Dhawan is definitely a better fielder than Prithvi.,4
"I want Punjab to win this whole thing.

There I said it",2
Chutiya hai par apna chutiya hai.,3
mmm baby put it on,2
Ok this tha over.,1
Calling it now...kxip will play the final!!,6
"Maxi playing responsibly.


Is this the part where I say 'Peak 2020 Stuff' ??",14
Keep hammering them,2
Rabada needs to come on next over,1
lmao pant with those cringey motivational shouts,3
"Good thing that Pant rarely removes his helmet. One of these days, one of the batsmen might ""accidently"" swing their bat at him.",2
Iyer should keep some legside fielders in to save Maxwell's singles. You want him to not rotate strike and try to slog it,2
Mast running,2
Pant is that boy while playing Gully cricket who memes his bowlers to get a wicket.,7
"Pant trolling kxip by saying just 1 wicket

He also knows punjab will bottle if pooran gets out",2
Pant could become a great desi bus conductor,6
Is Iyer saving Rabada for next match lol,10
I am pretty sure that Iyer doesn’t understand the concept of a strike bowler!,6
[removed],-4
I'm just thinking of the meme of the kid tensing so hard his veins are popping out of his head. That is Maxi resisting a reverse right now,9
Universe Boss deserves an IPL trophy,5
Shikar Dhawan pissed he wasted a ton on this game.,6
[deleted],5
How tf did kings bowling become so good? Kumble is a good coach kya? 😯,6
"Maxi has graduated from the Prithvi Shaw academy of 0(1) and  moved into to Thalas academy of 28(28)

Upgrades people upgrades",7
Man why didn't Mayank refuse that single. Pooran would have been runout,9
Someone's gonna pretend to attempt reverse sweep to hit Pant for shouting so much while keeping lol,1
Rishab “motivational speaker” Pant,12
"Niccy P is the absolute boss
Big boy biz all the way",2
How's MI's fairplay points unaffected after Pollard semi-threatening the umpire the other day? Or do super overs not count?,5
Fuck off Mark Nicholas you know it all wanker,3
Punjab winning IPL,3
It's sucide running,3
"C'mon maxi, go for a reverse sweep",2
"Some absolute brain fades from Iyer this match:

Bowling Stoinis, Tushar and Axar to Pooran when they needed a wicket instead of Rabada and Ashwin.",6
"I hope mayank is fit, not Injured",2
Maxwell is playing well imo. stop shitting on him until he gets out.,1
iF iT wAs A dIrEcT hIt 🤡,7
Maxwell with that Kohli running,1
"If we can lose from 1 off 3, we can lose from here too. don't let up guys.",3
"This mf Sanjay Bangar adds 2-3 new words to his vocab  every morning and uses them in the dugout.

Love it.",6
Maxi😂,1
"Pooran is a gayle that can run quick 2s

Don't @ me",6
"3 players running behind the ball and the 4th one picks it.

90s cricket vibes.",7
"Pollard's team at top of Fair Play award, now I seen it all...",11
Poorans got no chill. Maxi better just shout NO the moment he completes a single if it ain't a jog,3
Pooran making sure that even if the following batsmen shit their beds they still get less than run a ball chase to get the game,2
Maxwell needs to dig in before the tea break so he can fire in the next session,1
"After the period of craziness, KXIP are charging toward this target. Run a ball 50... surely they cant screw this up.",6
Man bring in Rabada,2
[deleted],8
"If these 2 continue, this will be the easiest win for KXIP, possibly for most of this IPL",3
Come on Pant... Make those weird sounds and shit.,6
I think KXIP think the target is 200,6
50 off 50. Fuck me this is going to the last ball isn't it?,7
I am really not mad at Maxwell this innings. Pooran is ballistic at one end and he has adapted well to get the partnership going.,11
Less than a run a ball,2
Pooran has hit more sixes this match than Maxwell has hit this entire fucking season,13
Pooran making Maxwell run harder.,6
Rahane doesn't miss that pooran run out btw,2
"I feel for Tushar, he is out now :s",5
3rd in fair play after releasing Ashwin 😎,6
"Rishabh ""Sandeep Maheshwari"" Pant",11
Ashwins strategy against pooran seems to be to give him easy singles and run him out,11
Aussies literally live in one of the hottest places on earth even they cannot stand the middle East heat,9
I remember Maxwell in his peak hitting Ashwin effortlessly,11
I have always been critical of Iyer’s captaincy but he has been absolutely shocking today to say the least.,5
Lmaoooo csk pushed down fair play table for the spark comment.,17
"No maxi don't go now , let Nicky p handle it",2
Goddamn Maxi thanks for using your brain,5
Pant just orgasmd,6
Pooran 8%? They gotta be kidding me.,3
Gayle has beautiful eyes,7
This is Maxwell's highest score this season,8
I have never seen Maxwell playing so watchful and careful.,8
Sarfaraz vs Rishabh in a shouting contest. Who would win guys?,7
We are third on fair play cause we're too nice to win games,12
Deshpande really fucked up the bowling single handedly.,5
Maxwell has that laugh. It's a danger to him,6
Bring on Rabada ffs,2
"Pooran trying to prove that the runout was not his fault....

by trying to get Maxi runout...

*Ironic*",3
KL has fucking inspired this team,4
Game too far gone for DC. That missed runout changed the game.,2
"That last shot.  
After all these years, despite his loss of form, Maxwell STILL can't resist going after Ash",3
Bc Gaan& maar li Dilli ki. With no lube!,1
If this was any other team I would say it would be an easy win,6
Pooran has a split bet on 3 run outs in the game,5
"Why not Rabada? Becuz at this rate, death bowling won't happen!",3
There is 48 balls left and there is a big partnership  wtf are they saving 3 overs of rabada for,3
See this match will also go to the last over...,3
"Looks like Ponting told Iyer before the game: 'You are on your own son, no strategies from me today...'",6
Chris Gayle might just be the coolest bloke to have ever lived,0
"The rate at pooran is going, maxi won't be able to hit his first six in ipl 2020 this game also",1
"45 off 48, run a ball and it comes down to 1 off 4. Hmmm",3
Maxi cant resist a miscued slog. Cmon maxi. Make this interesting by throwing away your wicket,1
LOL at KL being most indimidating batsman for KXIP. That is definitely the universal boss. He browbeats most bowlers.,8
53% people doing that poll don't know what intimidating means,10
this better not be the game where Rabada loses his wicket streak,2
I am convinced today that we are not winning shit under Iyer’s captaincy.,-3
Pooran pls play through sensibly,4
Kuch to hai tujhse Rabada,7
With this Maxwell has booked his place in punjab's team for 4 more seasons.,8
Rabada brought on 4 overs too late. Brain dead captiancy by Iyer.,2
Rabada is finally here,2
fucking hell pant,0
Why does Pant's Oyeee come out as Ohehehehe?,5
DD fans don’t worry Ashwin can mankad Pooran if he gets a chance /s,4
Rabada is used to bowling to Quentin,3
"Yeah kxip, keep rabada wicketless atleast one match",2
Lol...even luck is on pooran side today.,4
English comms trying hard to jinx Aussie Maxwell.,3
"""this one's for you Mayank""",5
Found the gap perfectly,5
more lives for Pooran than a cat today,5
Do you guys think KXIP will make Playoffs? They'll have to win all games,3
What new twist are we going to see today with Kings XI,4
Luck is on our side bro.,3
"I understand that they wanted to bowl tushar as a death over alternative as opposed to harshal, but then why is he bowling in the powerplay",1
DD will miss a lot of run outs to compensate for Dhawan getting dropped by CSK,2
[deleted],2
"Pooran, I have no words. This is the most fucking chaotic innings I have seen",5
Maxwell playing underrated innings,3
RIP the guy who picked Shaw instead of Dhawan in his team,6
Looks like even Rabada cannot save the game now.,5
Those baby shouts ain't gonna end anytime soon,2
Pooran can definitely score but there's this feeling back of the head that he is gonna throw it away,2
Why not a slip in there when that’s you only chance in this match!,2
The quiche won't need unleashing,5
Pooran you crazy man,4
Jimmy Neeshan will be breathing easily as Pooran and Taxi take the game closer and closer.,1
Pooran night till now,2
"Do you like Kagiso Rabada

Or being bowled late in the game",2

Shikhar D. : Am I a joke to you?",8

Wtf lmao,5
Press F in the comments for Pant,8
WTF,1
jinxed.,2
What the *shit*?,2
Well played Pooran.,2
"I guess so, some places in Australia is literally desert",3
Rode his luck and finally it ran out,3
Sensible doesn't suit u Pooran,9
Pants expressions 🤣🤣🤣,5
"Maxwell having more points than gayle is a joke

Gayle was a innings changer with that one over",11
BRIAN FADE MOMENT,5
"40 req of 45

This is where it starts getting tricky for kxip",8
Rabada and his obligatory wicket,3
Wtf,2
Rabada you beauty,3
This and 2 previous matches has showed Rahul to trust his teammates,4
"Maxwell needs to ask his partner to play calmly. 

*--Things I never expected to say.*",7
Fuck off Iyer! Just fuck off man!!,0
Soft dismissal lol,1
Rabada : Can't beat the streak,6

Rabada can never got wicketless,3
Pooran was on self destruct all the time still well Played champ,3
"If any team can screw it up from here, it's punjab",4
I don't know how to react,3
Thank god. Though match has slipped from our hands. At least NRR would be somewhat okay.,4
Arghhh! Hope Jimmy keeps his nerve and bring it home !,3
About time,3
"players losing their wicket IMMEDIATELY after the half century, what else is new?",4
These violent delights have soft ends,3
I'd like to think that pointed bat nod was to Mayank,3
Wtf was that,7
Oh so thats what they are going to do,2
Here comes the choke.,5
K bois time for a redditor to bat,7
Wow. Fuck.,3
"The onus is now on Maxwell. We have a game on, r/cricket.",4
COLLAPSE™ incoming,7
Rabada saving the day,4
Man Rabada is gold.. should have brought him in instead of that Stoinis over.,5
..... Every fucking wicket has been dogshit to watch,5
now imagine if ashwin bowled before tushars over and rabada bowled an over before.,3
F,3
So it all comes down to Maxwell,3
Halfway through the Redemption arc..... cause it's KXIP we're talking.,6
Kagiso *1 Wicket Per Match Warna Paise Vaapis* Rabada,26

Well well..... Is this the match?,1
Well played pooran,1
Finally Rabada has a wicket,1
Just started watching. Just here to see them choke,1
Nicky P 👏,1
Where did their review go?,1
Previous ball wasn't a Pant drop catch. Just putting it out there.,4
1 run from 3 balls coming soon,1
Please don’t KXIP this KXIP,2
"Yes KG!

i am dead inside",1
Is that... a twist?,1
There's that KXIP choke,3
So glad we waited till the RRR was 5 to bring rabada in. Thanks iyer,2
Maxwell needs to hit big or its a definite loss for kxip,3
Pooran went to wrong Kings he would have been even better under Thala's tutelage,-2
I have faith on Deepak Hooda.,3
"Unleash the quiche, motherfuckers",3
Time for KXIP to implode.,2
Oh man never ever easy for Punjab,3
DC could've had this much earlier bringing Rabada straight away. Now they're looking at a tough comeback.,3
It's started Bois,3
About time kings 11 fuck this up. This was going way too one sided,3
What a limp dick end to this chaotic innings,9
"Wow, Pooran just unlucky there",3
Nope still too easy for KXIP,1
This stance of Maxwell is the weirdest he has tried yet. I hope it brings change in his fortune.,2
KG keeping his great wicket taking run going,1
Come on neesham make us proudddd,2
Rabada 🐐,1
Aight bois tighten your seatbelts from here,2
Pullapse,1

Absolutely no one.


KXIP: Let's make this interesting 😏🥴",1
Oh here we go again . Punjab fans are u ready ?,2
"**12.3** Rabada to Pooran, OUT, Rabada strikes again. He gets a wicket at least every match. Pooran has gloved it while swaying out of its line **125-4**

Oh pls don’t fuck this up kxip,2
Rabada continuing his streak,2
Too late to bring Rabada,2
Oh no pooran - KXIP please don't take this to the last ball.,3
They have Hooda & Neesham to come so a very long batting line-up but only KXIP can lose from here,1
Well that was anticlimactic,2
Now bring in Axar and Ashwin. Chock them dadd..... Delhi,2
Pant acting like he took the catch of the century,1
I haven't seen Maxi trying to hit some this season.,1
"This is where Neesham over Jordan should come in handy

E: nvm they sent Hooda",1
Pant has cheeks chubbier than me and I don't even run let alone play an outdoor sport professionally.,4
I want a stream that exclusively focuses on pant. It's just him making his expressions and lezzgoooo's,3
"Pant like I'm done for the day, get me to hotel please",2
"Pooran has basically won the match for KXIP. If they lose the match from here, they don't deserve playoffs.",2
I n t e n t *intensifies*,2
Survive and that's enough,5
"Ok guys ready for this prediction:

SUPEROVER",2
"Nicholas ""wild bull"" Pooran",3
And Rabada's record is still on,2
Maxi hits a comfortable single slightly aerial that lands 25m short of long on and people go off like he has just tried to reverse a 150k Rabada ball off middle stump,5
hattrick right now would be lovely,1
"Finally, Pooran Couldn't  handle Pant anymore",5
Rabada's streak continues,3
Game on boys,1
"Come on Punjab, we know you can choke from here on.",6
"insert *ah shit, here we go again* meme here",3
Rabada is here to clean this up,2
Where's Neeshman?,2
That's an unfortunate dismissal. Pooran was looking really good.,2
Let’s win this boys,1
Can't wait for Maxwell to get out next over?,3
Gonna be a tight end to this game,1
We're not winning this but at least Rabada's wicket streak is alive,1
Pooran and Gayle has given the momentum .upto maxi and Neesham to finish it off,3
[deleted],1
Poollapse,3
KGR has been taking at least one wicket in the every match in IPL since 2017. And he's just 25. Holy fuck.,3
Can Anyone tell me Jimmy Neesham's reddit Username???,3
Hooda bats like me,7
Do you get why you bowl your strike bowler now Iyer?,5
Ahhh bringing in your strike bowler who has a wicket streak of 20+ matches going on to provide a breakthrough.. who would have thought that.,4
"How often does this happen with Rabada?

He gets smacked. Then he gets a wicket.",6
🤡,5
Collapse ?,4
I just wanna see an ipl match where KG ends without any wicket before i die,3
Arhhh fuck... Dugout have started to pump in ads.,1

I think kxip straight off do things like these fir the vibe lmao,5
KXIP plz no,3
"That was a soft dismissal, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone strike the ball so cleanly like Pooran has in the last 5-6 games in a long long time. Probably ever. His connection coupled with his batswing and elegance in something else. My word he's some talent.",18
Thank you rabada,2
RRR is below 6 now. I want to say it's a easy win but you literally can't trust these buggers till they hit the winning run,9
Every batsman from KXIP have got out in a horrible way so far....with Maxi on the crease.,3
What a disappointing dismissal,1
Delhi were easily 20-30 short looking at how KXIP have played.,2
"Hooda is a lucky mf lol

2 dropped catches last match and this",2
"Punjab is getting in the danger zone now.

Run A ball.",6
[deleted],3
No point keeping Maxwell if he can't get them through this,2
Twist in the tale. 😥,2
Jimmy was better choice here. Hooda is unpredictable at this stage.,3
Hooda is the key here i reckon,1
Spark™,1
I dont understand why Sarfaraz was dropped when he didnt do much wrong,2
Just 3-4 sixes and i am ready for super over,1
That was KXIP's biggest partnership this season that didn't include KL Rahul. Their 6th biggest overall,11
The bat twisting saved him,1
"IPL Auction prices

Prithvi Shaw: 3 crores

Nicholas Pooran: 4 crores",11
DD bowling reminds me of SRH of 2016,6
Rabada's short balls are SO tempting for catches,5
This is perfectly in our territory to fuck up from,10
*Very bad captaincy from Iyer. There should have been a forward short leg there*  just fuck off Iyer,0
I hope klpd doesn’t get diagnosed with ptsd after this ipl,7
The difference between good players and great players is that great players stay untill end to make sure their team win.,4
Wait why no Neesh?,3
If KXIP lose this KL is gonna kill everyone,11
Kings XI fans will need to see a cardiologist after this season,8
Iyer made two poor decisions today not bringing Ashwin early & holding Rabada for too late,6
[deleted],2
"Punjab fans, I think is winning comfortably tonight. Well done👍🏽👏🏽",2
"In most cases, 40 off 45 in a T20 match would mean I just go to sleep, but it's KXIP so we're waiting to see whether the usual memey implosion will occur",10
Good news is Rabada has only 1 more over and there is no Nortje today. Otherwise KXIP would struggle big time.,5
"Maxwell, please play out this last ball from KG.",5
Come on Maxi. I think it's the perfect time to execute a reverse scoop. I believe in you!,10
Too late unless Punjab wants to repeat their first game.,7
I still can’t believe how dumb Iyer is as captain.,-4
Your choice of commentary depends on whether you would rather suffer Bangar or Anjum.,8
I have no faith in Hooda,2
Maxi redemption arc??,9
Let’s go Maxi,3
Maxi,2
GO MAXI,2
"Man , that is the problem with kxip this season.... Even though only 4 batsmen are out.... Even though we only need 38 off 43... I still don't have faith that we will win this match... That's how kxip have played this season.",19
We mighy have an all-out tie today,8
Tushar is of no use today,1
Come on man i rly wanna watch maxwell redemption arc,6
Come on ashwin!,1
Goti muh me aagaya,3
"Scenes if redditor hits a 50*(20)
Edit:- nvm",7
Maxwell in his usual shitting the pants mode,3
Must not be Jimmy's Niche. Hooda  thought it,2
Tushar would like to forget this day. Lol,2
Punjab is winning 👍🏽,3
old maxi can finish this match in 2 overs.,6
If Tushar had caught that everybody would have given him a handwritten apology note,8
"Maxi hitting a boundary off Rabada, someone remind which timeline I am in?",9
Maxwell day bois,2
Maxi shifting gears.,2
boys you need to take these to make it happen,2
Maxwell redemption arc looking good,3
"Come on Kings XI, don't give them the sniff to get back in.",2
Tushar you mug,2
Has maxwell hit a six this season?,0
Is that hardus Villain from SA?? why he ain't playing??,1
They need 5 runs an over hope they know that,4
"If maxi brings this to Kxip from here, this can be a huge confidence boost for a guy like him whose been in just poor vein of form",5
Deshpande la Pooran poli jasta zhala aaj,3
"Pooran gets out 



Me: ae kya finisher bnega re tu",5
Hahah Maxwell still hasn't been training smart.,1
"Hooda is going to be playing for his position.

 Mandeep is coming back into the team next match otherwise, he's almost recovered",13
Pooran needs a 30 day yoga session with baba ramdev 🧘🤸,7
Tushar is having a very bad day... Tubbs probably.,3
Unleashing the quiche today making sense now,3
Punjab playing completely unnecessary shots in such a comfortable position,16
KLapse incoming,3
runs coming too easily for delhi to win this,2
Why is Pooran so pissed off lmaooo,7
Gayle's innings been crucial here.,4
Good KL got out early otherwise they wouldn't have reached here this fast,9
It would be funny if another KXIP DC match ends in super...,15
35 from 42 and I’m still not confident,7
Can Shikhar captain us again please? Iyer bowls Rabada when the match is over like always!!,7
[deleted],3
Hell of a run rate they're going at. This is showing up the Delhi batting even more than Dhawan did.,4
"Pooran was also in MI, m just thinking the players we have let go the poorans, buttler , chahal , kuldeep, shikhar many more still MI is one to top sides just coz talent made by us like bumrah , pandya bros, and old stars like Pollard , malinga",5
3 super overs today please,6
"If maxwell gets this, he will ensure his place in the team for another 6 years",6
rabada created 4 chances out of nowhere,8
Last time I saw a team shit a chase like this was Australia after Maxw...oh right.,3
Why was Hooda sent before Neesham?,2
"Most t20 team this season has been punjab ,their innings are just like highlights lmao",3
"Some years ago, this guy was dreaming if he could walk again. Brilliant",8
Wont feel bad today for Punjab winning this,6
DC will do in playoffs what India does in knockouts. Choke due to almost everyone collectively shitting the bed and poor captaincy,4
This team is the WI of IPL,5
Hooda's been too lucky,1
FFS don't bottle this KXIP,1
"Hooda before Neesham because of Ashwin? Neesh does well under pressure, not too bad in playing spin too.",1
Maxwell has to hit a six here. Conditions ideal,2
No luck with DC today,1
Calm Down Hooda please.,3
Kxip- Entertainment ka baap,3
Abe chutya Hooda,1
one more wicket and we're in.,1
"Required rate 5 rpo , Hooda isn't convinced",3
"You know if I was a god I'd make Punjab and CSK win every game from here, get to the finals, with Maxwell hitting a run-a-ball century with no sixes and still win it for Punjab",9
I want to be as lucky as Deepak Hooda.,4
DON'T TAKE ANY RISKS YOU DUMB FUCKS,9
Brain dead batting.,3
Bruh hooda,5
The game is in last ball decider zone now,4
Wtf are they playing in the air,3
Mesut Sams,2
What is hooda doing?,2
"Deepak ""please catch"" Hooda",6
This guy has skied 3/3 balls he's played and he keeps surviving 😂,12
is maxwell braindead or is he braindead,1
KXIP is trying their best to throw this.,7
"I'd feel more comfortable if it was 42 from 35. But since it's 35 needed from 42 balls, I'm nervous.",12
"i

kxip here giving heart attacks every other ball,4
Hooda wants a super over,2
"BC KXIP just want to make this interesting, don't they!",6
Come on maxiiiii,0
did Maxwell change his batting stance?,0
I ain't resting easy till required runs are below 20 or something. Been conditioned to see bottles with them and this one looks ripe for one.,4
Oh Nortje where art thou?,3
It's feels good too see how many people are hoping that Maxwell should play well today!,4
Let's hope off spinner maxwell can win this for kxip,7
If KXIP loses this game I'll never freaking support them again.,3
I need heart medicine.just play down the ground,8
Very ordinary captaincy from Iyer. That over from Stoinis was unnecessary,7
At least let Tushar finish his 50,3
Anybody wanna tell KXIP that they're allowed to win it without going to last ball/super over?,13
Nortje injured?,1
"First win the game before thinking of NRR, stop taking these risks",1
RCB and KXIP Final,6
"34 runs in 40 balls with 6 wickets in hand . 
But KXIP",3
inb4 maxwell on strike with 6 off 1 required,7
Who was the fielder on the last ball of Rabada's over? The one which Maxwell hit for 4,2
The sams guy kinda looks like that green animal in Ice age,2
Tushar looks agitated,2
Aah that batting stance!,2
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",17
"3 balls.. 3 floaters into the air in an almost runner ball chase. 

Wtf is Hooda playing at?",5
all they need to do is tuk tuk.,6
Goosebumps everytime I see Lara with the bat in his hands.. peak Lara would have shown these peasants,1
[deleted],9
This match is as good as over and I would very much like a different captain for Delhi than piss ass “let me protect my 5th bowler and then get folks out with my strike bowler” Iyer!,-3
Jeez this is some tense running between the wickets.,4
Punjab really need the tuk tuk msd right now,23
"Oye Kings XI, the run rate is in grasp, please don't take any uneccesary risks. I beg of you please play a bit more conservatively, for my heart's sake.",7
Sam's looks like he was summoned from the dead,6
Deepak Hooda can't even pull off a spot fix,2
Why do u bother wearing a mask if you are gonna keep it that way,5
Idk what's going to fuck up KXIP. Hooda hitting in the air or Maxwell's stance,5
Seems like Iyer has set a perfect field in order to not take wickets,6
Bowling a second over of tushar at that point was brain dead,4
"Iyer  : Bro, wanna hear a joke?

KL   : Yes bro

Iyer :  Comfortable wins

KL   : I don't get it

Iyer : Exactly",59
How many chances have we given to Maxwell?,3
KL looks dead inside this season,3
Suhas living life in slow mo,4
Just not Tushar's day,9
What is wrong with maxi’s stance..,10
[deleted],12
3 super overs incoming?,8
"lmao KL face, 39 balls to go but he's already looking dead",24
Idk about everybody else but Sams has done a damn good job so far,11
KXIP showed more intent in these few overs than CSK'S whole season,64
Rahul sitting in the pavilion with a dead expression lmao,9
"I'm kinda feeling proud that among the big 3 this season, it was the most difficult to beat us by the ""revamped"" kxip",5
Congrats to Maxwell on his 1st twentury of the season,44
"KXIP are going to qualify at this rate. The difference has definitely been Gayle, not so much his batting but more so his composure and the fact that he brings some much needed intent to this team after a string of defeats.",31
Same teams had super over like 2 match of the ipl,4
kxip are in a position where even jadhav could win this,8
Any other team would be chilling if they were in this situation. My heart is racing even now,12
[removed],13
These guys already played a super over,6
Go maxiii TT TT,1
Looks loke both teams are trying to lose.,-2
Class shot from Glenn !!,3
"Kings need to be happy campers....

Positive In tent",3
"Damn, are we really going to waste Dhawan's century? Shame",2
Punjab Intent👏🏽👏🏽,2
"The only thing is, if another wicket falls then the game is in the balance",1
"Maxwell keep doing it! Redemption arc, ftw.",4
Come on Maxi don't throw it away now. Even a 30\*(42) will do.,4
Mi will definitely pick up carey as backup.,3
Why everyone here shitting on Hooda? He did played decently in last match against MI.,4
Finally maxi looking confident,4
"Maxy, thank you for playing maturely",4
Maxwell getting into form might turn the fate around of KXIP by a fucking lot,5
Tushar been total shit today,3
I told you this off spinner can bat.,13
"Not expecting anymore twists in this game now, going to sleep",3
He was trying to pierce that gap. Finally.,2
"Mumbai players of DC doing braindead stuff today, including Deshpande

Maxi doing great",5
Lara in dugout has been a very pleasant surprise. He has been providing great analysis but he does not take himself too seriously which is great to see.,7
Finish it soon boi and let us keep up that NRR,2
"Way too many missed runout chances in 14 overs of crickets, both sides need to be better.",1
"As a non believer in Maxi’s finishing ability, I have to say that was some shot, my man’s playing grounded when it matters",6
"DC, RCB and KXIP going to the playoffs would be great;  The three teams who are yet to win  a title.",10
Maxwell redemption incoming,1
"Damn, Kings XI is like paper in rock, paper and scissors game. Beat Rockstars but go down against the rest",5
"If Maxwell is making runs, you know it's not going to be DC' day.",4
Bring in Ash,2
That was beautiful. Maxwell Redemption Arc in full force.,3
Maxwell's hit a half half century🦀🦀🦀,4
"You know our management is fucked when they come out of the power play and bowl Stoinis! That over had to be Rabada!!

Like for all of Ponting praises, he lost a game where the team scored 434 for fucks sake!",1
"Friendship ended with Neesh, Maxi is my best friend again",7
Now he's Boss Maxwell,3
Maxi making his millions count now,6
are tattoos mandatory for new Indian players now?,10
KKR really need to loose tomorrow to keep this tournament interesting,10
"KXIP is like, i am not writing Internals. Externals i will score 100 directly. Living on the edge...

\#Engineering #VTU if you know what i mean...",13
A guy scores a 100 at 175 SR and the team score was still 164 at the end shows how much other players let DC down big time.,29
Maxi doing well for KXIP is my ultimate dream,8
Tushar 2 overs were so costly,5
People who watched Maxi's English innings are lucky. I haven't seen him hit a six in a long fucking while.,8
Maxi is winning this one for KXIP. Sad that it has to come against DC but so happy for Maxi.,16
Punjab is the most exciting team to watch in this ipl,34
"the team is filled with match winners, yet it turns into ""bangladesh when they realize they might actually win""

Press F for Mushfiq-Scoops-Leaps-Pulls-Dies",25
I hope we win today so we can beat the openers-are-the-only-batsmen-in-kxip tag,9
"Maxi playing a sensible knock in the IPL?

Truly these are strange times",13
bkl 2 ad dikhane ke bad kon krta hai strategic timeout pehle krdete na,10
Maxwell is doing what Smith was doing with Buttler the other day.,9
Maxwell's batting stance looks like that of Chandrapaul,9
Where are the cocky DC fans now ?,5
"I never doubted Daniel Sams, haven't ever talked shit and never disagreed with his inclusion in the Aus squad to England... Big fan since day 1",6
"I am sleeping cuz I have to get up early. I know Punjab is going to win, otherwise I will eat my sock. Good night guys, see u all tomorrow. Muahh😘😘",5
1 2 many mother lovers  be around ya,7
Axar can get Hooda out so don't give him next over please.,2
For a team with a lot of problem in the middle- SRH loves hanging out there on the table every season,13
Maxi said fuck off to r/cricket lol,1
Lmao come back from an ad break just to tell us there's a timeout so we get another ad break,5
Maxwell apology thread?,3
"Feel like there are only 6 DD players on the field, literally no one covering anything, no dot balls, no pressure, no catching chances, no run out chances, fucking nothing",9
I have a feeling the first KXIP game with the 'short run' might prove to be very very costly.,4
Is Shubman really the X factor for KKR anymore?,6
"Pls do an RCB 2016 KXIP, then lose the final to RCB. That'd be glorious.",9
KXIP is always Paisa Vasool,8
Strategic tire timeout lol,4
"Just taking out one of the fast bowlers from the line up makes DC bowling a lot less threatening.

Still quite good. But, not extraordinary any more.",4
"Maxwell smiles.. finally! Now he's gonna play all of the remaining games for KXIP, IF he gets them through tonight",5
There should be excitement quotient table for IPL like FairPlay awards. We all know who will top that table,4
"Delhi need Rabada and Ashwin to make the most of their last over, have to use them now, can’t leave them
for the end",8
Jimmy neesham asking maxwell to don't fuck the chase and let him in,12
Make an arrangement for 5 team playoffs if kxip doens't qualify. Excitement machine,3
"So basically, all Rahul has to do was play with intent and score 30 (20) and trust his teammates to do their job instead of anchoring the shit out of the match and play 70(60) and put everyone else on pressure and fuck up in the last over. Damn, sounds very simple.",3
Fucking just bowl Deshpande now just to confirm we were playing dumb today.,-4
"With guys like Maxwell and Pooran in your team, you always know that if you win, you're gonna have a great NRR.",2
Bruh this condom ads getting me embarrassed in front of family,11
KXIP Robin Hoods 😂😂😂,6
"In recent news, police bust a drug den. Cricket team found OD'ing on intent.",7
How swell it would be to beat MI and DC back to back this season?,12
"DC need to get the target down to 1(3), thats when the magic happens",6
RCB vs KXIP final done for sure... Also haven't seen a SA vs WI final,8
That tweet about the short run costing play off spot might actually come true now lmao,9
Story of DC this game. Only one guy batted really well and only one guy got clobbered badly. What a day.,5
"Wonder if Kumble had told Maxwell it was his last chance 5 matches ago, he would have performed",7
Punjab team looks really good on paper,7
There's a fucking condom ad. Shows how much we need to control the population.,17
KXIP is the most unpredictable team so far.,8
Why does Sanjay Bangar start doing regular commentary in the dugout,2
Pant is so fucking annoying,-2
"RR already fucked the chances of Csk yesterday.

RR has a match with SRH , KXIP and KKR. Chance to throw them out of this tournament.",2
Is hooda better than mandeep?,1
Gotta love pant still cheering the team on,4
Maxi definitely gonna try to hit a six atleast,3
"KXIP should easily be top of the table if they weren't chokers. Instead, they will probably not make top 4. Makes me sick.",5
"Holy fuck everyone shitting on the time out usually !!! 

And there are like 8 dudes from KXIP giving strategy to the two batsmen :p",5
"KKR would be afraid, very very afraid IF Punjab continues this form, although Punjab aren't at 100% obviously.",2
KXIP is giving us 2014 MI vibes,5
I am fist pumping at every single here. Don't let me down bois,9
Think Pooran was playing for team's NRR,8
Looks like Hooda is the latest victim of Thalanavirus pandemic.,4
"Boy oh boy, that Nicolas Pooran is a gem of a cricketer. Looking at you West Indies, I hope you don't mess this up like you did with another remarkable talent who was on the rise, in Adrian Bharath.",4
This condom ad is quite hot.,3
"Punjab's last 4 matches are against SRH, KKR, RR and Sparks. They can definitely qualify for playoffs.",12
Hooda has made his career out of one innings,2
Like my English teacher used to say- this is not a fish market Pant,10
"After ipl final there shud be a charity match betn winner n wooden spoon

Scenes if wooden spoon holder wins",13
Altrozzzzzz,2
Kxip pulling off a Mi 2014 here.,9
Fucking banger interrupting others for altroz.,5
It's not like Punjab didn't gave us chance. They gave plenty but our fielding let us down in the end.,11
"Looking at the economy of other bowlers, Tushar really fucked up :/",9
Ooh baba.,2
Why is Hooda shit 90% of the time but randomly pops off once in a while against Mumbai,7
I feel Maxwell became slow between the wickets.,3
Damn i missed pant,6
This timeout was definitely needed to get my heart rate stabalized a bit.,3
Hooda is a batsman? What a Joke,2
Hooda bAtTiNg like a Test \#11.,3
Owwurhghhh. Pant sounded like a tiger lmao,12
Very subdued Altroz spot by Mark there.,4
W O W,1
KL's intent is too less for this team lol,1
Only if Pant gave more thought on his batting rather than what he shouts behind the stumps,1
Delhi definately needs to improve their fielding. Need to build pressure,1
"Maxwell, I've stayed a fan through what must be getting on for five disappointing years. That period where you kept claiming to be a gun red-ball cricketer. The feud with Wade. God knows how many inexplicable balls hit in the air straight to mid-off. And even this new batting stance that makes George Bailey look like he's not taking the mickey. But if you run yourself out here, that's it! We're done!",3
We need a r/RandomPantNoises,11
Lmao that grunt,1
"Pant as hawker.. ""ek wicket le lo bhai, ek wicket"".. No imagination needed, none.",8
That midwicket fielder should have been brought in earlier against Maxwell to stop singles. He would probably have done something stupid if he didn't get those easy singles against Ashwin.,2
Are they gonna take it to last over?,1
The rest of Dugout gonna buy Bangar an Altroz just to troll Swanny.,5
Pant is badly missing his man Paine today.,8
Anjum vs Sanjay,2
Hooda is basically Jadhav,1
For Pant's sake shut the stump mic,6
Maxi looking at the scoreboard again and again. He can't believe he contributed to the team.,4
Now this feels familiar,1
Why are these guys patronizing Bangar? His English is so bad ..,1
Maxwell's most effective innings since 2014.,7
"Please guys for once, don't make it interesting",10
"Maxwell is playing a very responsible innings, I really hope he does not bottle it",3
"I know KXIP should play safely to win but given their position, shouldn't they look to boost their NRR?",2
Have to say the difference between Dhawan's captaincy some days ago vs Iyer's has been quite a lot,8
Ngl missed Rishabh Pant's commentary from the WK mic hahah,7
Someone slap pant,7
This surely was 180-190 pitch. Rest of DC batsmen messed up bad.,8
Scriptwriters need kxip in playoffs to pull another double super over.,3
Maxwell with this inning ensuring one more ipl contract at least,2
"This is literally a lesson on how to waste Rabada. 

Thank you Iyer for the class!!",4
Maxwell hasn't hit a six in IPL ever since Delhi Daredevils became Delhi Capitals. Let that sink in,19
Just go through this over please,2
What's with those half hearted shots?,4
Hooda was playing well the last time when RRR was around 10. Sub 6 RRR is where he struggles at. Truly KXIP material,7
Hooda should be the one trying to play some shots and Maxwell there to support. Maxwell's wicket holds the highest value.,2
"Don't know if Hooda looks any different batting in the nets, but it should be pretty obvious that he doesn't belong in the IPL",2
Happy for Karnataka XI Punjab. Hope to see you in the eliminator,2
Maxwell's how faced more than 80 balls this season and hasn't hit a six yet. That's so unlike him.,3
How addictive is r/Cricket seriously... Missed my assignment lol,13
deepak hooda has a best fc score of 293\* wtaf,2
Wicket alert this over 🚨,3
"Ghutne tek diye Rabada ne, Maxi ke samne.",1
I am still so scared that kxip will lose from here,3
"Either u love the pant commentary or hate it

Nothing in between",2
[removed],2
Just need couple of wickets to spice things up,1
not a single yorker by dc till now,1
"Unpopularopinion, pooran's knock here displays why he's inconsistent, dude tries to take way too many unnecessary risks. It's unfortunate he got out doing the sensible thing because it means he'll not learn his lesson",8
Rabada Pattis.,3
1 off 3 incoming?,2
Hooda boy take singles only,4
Surely Mandeep isn't as bad as this ?,5
Hooda tatti hai bc. Mandeep kaha hai?,2
Maxi teasing DC fielders,2
Mujhe inke kuchh lakshan thik nahi lag rahe. Inse ho payega?,1
"Bhai one tip one hand ka kya matlab hota hai

Shikhar: Haan chal na lavdya",3
I would have a short leg in and a slip in,1
KXIP in IPL is what Pakistan to World cup.,23
KL laughing first time this tournament,10
"Every1 say wicketkeeper is d vice-captain of the team , best man to set fields for the team but I just can't imagine Pant with his weird 15 yo noises marshalling the troops",6
I kinda want kxip to make playoffs but they're also the scariest team other than dc/mi for rcb to face,3
Lol...still no six yet.,10
why are they not playing Mandeep?,7
Damn I just realized KXIP could be ahead of KKR if it wasn't for Tewatia and short run,2
We are playing the whole 20 overs guys,1
So he's gonna go big now,1
Maxwell hit a six break the curse,3
"Taxi na na, Maxi it is 💪


E- Aaaaaand back to being Taxi.",3
"If KXIP wins, who will be MoM?",2
Rabada some of the Russell Yorkers please,2
Maxi...in,5
Still no six for Maxwell this season,5
"Damn, everyone supporting kxip,  even DC.",9
Maxi wicket incoming,17
Over/under on 1 off 3?,3
Not a single yorker from Rabada. And he is not bowling too many yorkers this season... Hmm,6
Glendeep Singh Maxwell!,9
Okaayy spankswell I see you.,8
Relaxed KL <3,6
Fuckkkkk,8
Oh no,8
I'll call it a six. Just for the intent.,8
pleeezzz rishabh,5
Does anybody remember Bailey’s stance? Kinda looks similar to Maxwell.,5
Oh ffs,3
Collapse incoming,6
That's a great catch. Very very difficult,4
Brilliant catch,4
Nice catch actually...,6
"Maxwell showing some S P A R K

Glad Kings XI stuck to their process",10
Oh no.,2
"Whatever happens, maxi not hitting any sixes",2
What a dumb fucking shot,7
MASSIVEE........for four,4
ah shit here we go again.,5
Big ~~SHOW~~ Trailer,9
Match still on?,1
Lol Maxi. Can't help himself,4
What a catch!,3
WHAT. WAS. THE. NEED.,5
"Bhosdike -> Boss 

Boss Maxwell

Boss -> Bhosdike

Bhosdike Maxwell",3
KG YOU BEAUTYYYYYYTY,2
You didnt need to do it maxwell,2
"I have seen all Delhi games this season and I can tell you with great confidence all of these things:

 - Shaw needs to be dropped.

 - Iyer absolutely wastes Rabada every match.",1
Still no six for Maxi..,4
Wtf Maxi,6
I spoke too soon :(,2
Fuck this....pure shit,5
Bring on the redditor,3
Maxwell is a retard,4
C O L L A P S E,8
"Ahhh, the Maxwell we expected",7
Oh Maxi! Sweety no. We don’t do it that way,6
Classic,5
Lund,7
"I don't understand why Maxwell tries to take on opposition's best bowler 
 
He could be so much better if he just keeps his ego in check",9
Unnecessary,4
Useless shot by maxi. Should have stayed till the end,8
let's push till the last over and get some pressure.,6
Why would you play that shot?,6
Gotta appreciate Pant for holding on to this. That was high as fuck,11
Danger™©,2
Fuck still no six,2
"Delhi probably should’ve got 180 to make this game competitive, but Deshpande’s overs probably cost them the game. Going at 20 RPO is brutal. 

Poor Dhawan will feel robbed, a second consecutive century at a fantastic SR and this happens

Edit: Hold on Maxi is out, now it’s interesting",5
CHOKE??!,3
Another twist?,1
Scriptwriters back at it again,2
Redditor to save the day.... right??,2
I don't understand what's with batsman hitting Rabada and then trying to send the next ball out of the park,5
dumbest move by maxi,2
"If a player hits a six with textbook slog over mid-on which he learnt at his cricket academy, will it still be called unacademy cracking six?",4
Chonky boi finally done something good today,5
Brainless maxwell can’t stay inside too long . Has to pop out,6
Kxip pulling a Kxip?,3
Maxwell trying for a 6 too hard. Just see this match off dumbo,1
"Was the run rate 18rpo or what??!
Maxi , this is the part where you show maturity and take a single & get off strike ffs",9
Pretty good from Pant,2

"**15.5** Rabada to Maxwell, OUT,  **147-5**

GJ Maxwell c &dagger;Pant b Rabada 32 (24b 3x4 0x6) SR: 133.33",2
can KXIP screw this?,2
Collapse coming. Kxip still got it to choke from here.,2
Maxwell played well,3
Game on,2
There are people dying of poverty and Maxwell is getting paid millions for this,3
Why Maxi? Why?,6
Vintage Maxwell that,6
love how nobody had the expectation rishi would actually catch it hahaha,5
Shaw-esque shot,2
Maxwell just can't help himself.,6
Can someone explain what a cross seam delivery is?,2
I knew pant would have caught that.,0
Oof the KLapse incoming,10
Neesham to bring KXIP a win to meme r/cricket,6
Twitter contents out there.,3
Of course Maxwell did that after hitting a four,7
Only KXIP can lose from here.,2
Lmao Maxwell. Gtfo,4
Maxwell moment,4
"Stoinis to do a hatrick
.
N repay the Curran's one",1
Our representative is now at the crease lads. Respect the Neesh,12
Pant was terrific there. Brilliant catch. Maxwell wtf was he doing?,3
Super over pakka,2
Alright Bois. Bets on Punjab losing this on the last ball,3
I am a csk fan but the amount of drama kxip gives has gotten me thinking,4
Take that haters🖕 And I got my wicket alert right too 😌,2
KXIP: **NRR is overrated**,1
Hope Neesham doesn't suck here,1
Maxi you’re shit. I hope KL says this to your face.,1
Brain dead to hit Rabada across the line when 1s and 2s are all that's needed. Maxi WTF.,1
All those deliveries left to play but they still choose my anxiety.,8
This was the first time mayank and rahul were out during PP in ipl 2020,5
Oh maxi....why u do dis?,2
Take us home Jimmy,3
"Made about 32 more runs than any kxip fan expected, we’ll take that",4
Reddit represent.,3
Any Shaww during the catch,1
Yorker gods not blessing DC.,3
Why would you do that when all you needed were singles....especially with the collapse track record,6
Rabada is way too OP,4
Good innings from specialist bowler Maxi though,5
"Death, taxes and Rabada's 2 wickets/ match are guaranteed.",5
And thus Maxwell retains his playing 11 spot for 2 more years...,4
Big brain Maxi can't see of two fucking balls of Rabada before going for glory ffs,4
The good thing is we played Neesham and only 1 more ball from Rabada and he's done.,3
~~Foakes~~ Samson would have caught that,2
All kxip fans please get a medical insurance. I am searching now,13
Just two more wicket of NEESH & HOODA please ! MATCH is gng to be so much more interesting,1
Neesham so low in the order may as well call him Shinsham,6
Redemption Arc canceled,3
Great catch. Maxwell shitting even though the match is well under control,3
Effects of not training smart ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯,5
With this 32 Maxwell has insured his place in KXIP at least for the next two IPLs,6
Messiah is here bois,4
this is peak kxip,2
"Even though he didn't finish it, I'm not mad at Maxwell today. He stayed long enough to get us so close, just 18 needed.",3
Neesham redeem kxip.,1
"Maxwell.. going to type something nice and there he goes, he threw the wicket.",2
180 would have made this such a tense and thrilling match.,3
Seeing the main bowler off woulda been too mainstream innit,9
"Dumb shot but atleast he made an important contribution before getting out, and that alone is an improvement for Maxwell",9
Maxwell has such brainfade moments while batting while he's usually pretty smart while bowling,7
Neesham to take KXIP to another super over thriller.,7
Only KXIP can defeat KXIP,3
Aah this is the KXIP we know,6
"Tuk tuk is the basics of cricket, what are these stars high on west indies school of cricket",5
Why Maxwellll,2
Not bad Maxwell you had us in first half.,4
"I guess we know why they call him the big show

at least he got some runs today",3
"Well now we have 2 players playing for their spot. 

Hooda still doesnt fill me with confidence but im sure Neesham should be pretty sensible. 

I shouldnt be anxious 18 reqd off 25 but i am lol",5
That went to shit but I still think Maxwell is getting into his gears which is good,6
RABADA : plot twist,5
Taking bets for how many runs needed of the last over.,6
One player who can take your wicket and you choose to take a risk on him. Maxwell is basically doing whatever he feels like,5
That's a fucking shit shot,6
Redditer is gonna get the W for KXIP,11
"Neesham: Fine, Ill do it myself",11
I hope Hooda doesn't do anything stupid now. I trust Neesh to play sensibly.,10
Still not a single six in this ipl by Maxwell,4
Bruh i just predicted maxi's wicket XD,2
Only 16 runs to win and still not sure about the victory. Clearly KX is 90s Indian team.,16
Maxwell not hitting a six this season says a lot of about his confidence at the moment,7
End it Jimmy... End it!!!,3
"take out hooda too, pretty please",2
Just when I got hope,4
Just see off the best bowler in the tournament.,1
Glenn fuck NRR maxwell,3
Nope still too easy,3
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jeo4zk/match_thread_38th_match_kings_xi_punjab_v_delhi/g9g85hz/

I don't care if he scores in this game but Hooda is crap.,7
The. Quiche. Has Been. Unleashed.,5
Swann 😍,2
So who is winning today's super over ? :P,6
"And yet again.

Smack Rabada. Then get out.

Maybe treat the highest wicket taker with a bit of respect?",3
I want to chill in the dugout with the commentators!,2
Contenders for catch of the season,1

Inb/4 redditor playing cricket hohoho very funny guy mr quiche.,7
Let's support our fellow Redditor and make IPL table interesting shall we?,4
I hope maxxi comes out of the rut.,4
Maxwell played well,5
Match about to get interesting,3
More spanking in dressing room for maxi tonight regardless of result,3
"You already got a four, should have just milked him around for singles and stayed there at the end. Would have done him a world of confidence.",11
Neesham will win kxip in...... *superover*,10
"CSK : lack of intent

KXIP : too much intent.",63
"Surely Punjab can not lose it from here,can they?",8
"18 from 25

Pls not again punjab",11
Well it wasn't a reverse scoop per say but I ain't complaining.,5
tf maxi we were rooting for you buddy it's under a run a ball,3
punjab gonna lose bruh 😔 2020 rly badbad rip,1
Was just about to comment how Maxi hasn't thrown his wkt this match,5
"Other teams fans : KXIP surely cant jinx this! 


KXIP : OBSERVE",9
Neesham's ipl career on line here.,4
"Maxwell could've easily scored a 50, stayed till the win, and won favour in the camp, but no.",4
Please don't fuck this up..... please don't fuck this up,10
"LOL, last ball close game coming, typical KXIP.",5
Is hooda a good t20 player or test,1
Maxwell's talent is stolen and trapped inside some cricket bat like the Space jam players.,7
Why... Just why,4
Guys what happens if 2nd superover is tied?,8
Can we loose a couple more tickets to make things more marketable?,1
Everyone knows Pooran's weakness is 140+ pace & Gayle's Ashwin still Iyer fucked up,0
Rabada is even taking wickets when the match is over. Imagine if Iyer actually used him as a strike bowler to change a match for once.,5
Innovative ways to achieve a super over,12
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jeo4zk/match_thread_38th_match_kings_xi_punjab_v_delhi/g9g2xps?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

I was close to being correct.",4
Let Hooda take the risks if you don’t have the patience. Hit someone after Rabada finishes if you don’t have the patience. You. Dumb. Cunt.,1
MAXWELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😩😫😤😪😭,2
One more wicket and then most of them are no. 11 like batsman,5
If kings 11 lose this.....,5
Axar and Ashwin are DC's last hope. They should be able to trouble the new batsman.,1
I don't see how DC can win this. 17 runs is nothing to defend.,2
"KIXP losing this, the absolute banter loving legends",0
KXIP show too much intent for their own good sometimes,4
Anyone up for yet another super over,1
Only punjab and pakistan can lose or make a game interesting from this spot they are neighbours too,1
Didnt Maxwell know he needed 4 runs an over?,7
I think Hooda's gonna win us the match,1
"KXIP, you can't seriously lose from this position

KXIP: DO YOU KNOW ME AT ALL?!",11
"Scenes, if this goes to superover",8
"No more Rabada, deep sigh of relief",2
Swann and Styris - Gems in the dugout!,6
Between Jadhav and Swann I'm still surprised Swann got to keep his job!,0
"Why win the easy way, when there is a difficult way",7
A wicket or two here would make things so interesting,1
"Rabada gets wickets when batsman attack him, yet Iyer was bowling Stoinis when Pooran was on a rampage",5
So who should come out in the super over,6
Scriptwriter letzzz goooooo,3
Haven't seen more idiotic game awareness than Maxwell today. There is no need of any shot at all.,0
Come on script writer. Give us another Super Over (:,3
OOYYYEEE ASH,3
Hooda what you doing 7(14),3
"KXIP doing what they do best, Choke.",6
I muted my TV and still heard Pant,11
Kxip = Elliott/Mr. Robot confirmed,2
Did... Did pant just bark like a dog?,10
Not sure why Maxi couldn't just bat out the last few balls of rabada. Then it would have been a smooth run till the end....,10
Hooda to be bought by CSK next season.,4
Oh boy did we miss his chirping,14
Pant begging for a wicket now lol,7
"Random Youtuber must be yelling at Swanny who was singing 'break free' .. copyright BC, beware of copyrights",3

The wait for a Maxwell six continues.,5

We need a thala innings here for once,3
"It's going to be 16 off 18 , then 12 off 12 , then 8 off 6 .... And dc win.",14
Pant asserting dominance with his noises is the reason kxip are losing wickets,15

KXIP: oh yeah it's an RCB TYPE YEAR,  LETS PLAY LIKE RCB",12
"The true redditor will win it, he is unfazed by all these last over finishes",18
"KXIP have now beaten Mumbai, RCB and DC. The tough fixtures are all done. Next they only have KKR, SRH, RR and CSK. If they can keep this momentum up they can not only make it to the playoffs, they can even finish as high as top 3 if a couple of other results go their way too...",1
Fuck it! Wicket alert this over 🚨,2
The only way Iyer is a great captain if if you have all 5 bowlers who are great. Wait that’s exactly like Ponting lol.,8

Classic Kedhar Jadhav,1
A spinner in the 17th over and this nincompoop has no idea what to do,1
KXIP so scared of bottling this that they aren't even trying to finish this early to boost their NRR,3
Earthboy was like thank god I didn't have to catch that.,4
If only nortje played this match..,2
Hooda hell does this batsmen think he is?,3
Neesham out there karma farming,1
"Your top 3 dugout commentators ? Mine are Scott, Lara, Swann in that order.",2
If somehow DC pills this one off. Definitely they deserve this year's cup.,2

KXIP: Where's the fun in that?",17
My fking god.... It's happening again m,4
"With that catch, Pant gets a free pass to shout whatever he wants.",9
When is the last time Neesh batted?,1
Death taxes and Rabada taking wickets in this IPL 2020.,8
KXIP are the only team in this IPL whom people would still think could lose with 17 needed off 24 and 2 proper batsman in the middle.,12
"Lmao, Pant ran cause he knew Prithvi was there.",11
Stfu Pant,6

Wtf was that batflip,1
Pant stfu man,5
Who do you think is gonna kill Hooda today... KL or Pooran?,4
Lmao Pant is an entertainer,7
They should just turn off the crowd noise when Pant is up at the stumps. He will make all the necessary noises,3
"Is this a freaking Test match?
Just take some ones or twos atleast",1
Lmao Pant noises.,8
Hope the quiche is dense enough today to take this pressure.,2

Pant is the only person who is keeping the match interesting by his antics,12
Pant is my spirit animal,7
I think aggarwal and gayle should come for super over and obviously shami for bowling,9
Pant has devolved to Doggo howls now,8
Stop squealing pant,7

Wow pant what was that,3

Hooda is bringing the balance between CRR and REQ by eating balls. Thanos would be proud.,6
WTF Pant,1
Idk how but i have a feeling kxip is gonna find a way to fuck this up,1
OMG Pant. Be better,6
"Risabh Pant on stump mike: Yo boys, I am sing song",22
Pant is shit today.,2
Kxip: Deja vu,7
Shaw shared some of his medicine with Pant during the break.,1
"Pant shudnt be allowed to orgasm on the field

Even if he is, he cant moan so loud . I am watching with my family man.",8
Hooda black magic worked pretty well id say lmao,1
Interesting. CSK and KXLP are the only two teams capable of fucking this up.,7
Hooda City Center ko out karo,11
Hooda gives me no confidence tbh,3
"RISHABH uses SCREECH  


Batsmen avoid the second run. It's super effective.",19
lol someone needs to compilation of Pant keeping,6
Pant behind the stumps sounds like a pack of hyenas,13
I love this from pant though,7
If Hooda loses this I think he should retire from T20s,3
Ashwin will make Pant diet just for that,9
Pant keeping has been worse .,4
How can we get to super over?,2
Someone make a petition for ipl to have a pant mic every match even after crowds are back,4
Hooda is so nervous.,2
"Kishan, Pant, Samson who's the better keeper",1
Did a off spinner just bowl a googly...,9

Sam pls,1
Pant playing on 100ms ping there,8
That Lifebouoy ad would look really inappropriate if the sound was off.. some questionable gestures there,8
Hooda is shit. Isn't he?,5
Can a redditor jinx himself on r/cricket before playing.... That's too op,5
Its clear hooda had all the luck of kxip,1
Which ipl season has had the most super overs ?,1
If you hate on Pant for providing entertainment from behind the stumps then I'm sorry but you're a miserable person.,12
horrid performance from Pant today,5
Calm down on the intent lolll...kxip needed a Pujara In the middle lollll,1
Ashwin bowling leggies???,1
Did he just bowl leg break!?,1
"Come on, Neesham! It's been two days, haven't seen a super over",2
Has Hooda won any matches ever?,2
Maxwell's shot was totally unnecessary and careless.,1
Ashwin absolutely done with Pant's shenanigans,3
"All Pant does is make noise, bat a little, and miss chances lmaoo",7
DC pulling it back. One more good over and it's going to interesting.,3
Stop howling and try to catch the ball pant.,4
It's happening isn't it ? The brain-dead finishing,6
"14 runs required off 18 balls.

Only one team can give sweats to its fans even at such stage.",9
Pant vs Sharapova is a good scream contest,7
"Lol Ashwin angry at Pant for not taking an impossible take, Ashwin r/cricket shitposter confirmed",7
This is going to super over,2
"So whose fans do you think more want DC to steal a win here... DC'S fans or RR, SRH and KKR's fans?",2
Ashwin be like: Stop squealing and get him stump out Bro...,5
Pant seems to be only good for providing noise behind stumps .,3
Opposition batsmen will intentionally throw their wicket away just to stop hearing Pant.,5
"DC should lose some points today because of Pant's bullshit interference while the batsmen are trying to communicate while running. If Pant was actually calling for the ball, or giving directions, it's acceptable. But to shout for the heck of it like a fucking money is uncalled for.",5
This match was decided by in one over by Gayle. What a guy.,25
Common Rahul just stay till the end next match. Even if you score 60 off 60.,3
I think Tushar will have a decent comeback if he bowls,1
Has Pant been shit today or were they all just tough chances?,1
*Pant has every sound available in animal kingdom*,3
Bad field placement. Easy singles on offer,3
 I swear if you lose this punjab,7
I'm scared that they gonna lose this match. Only KXIP can find a way to fuck up the game from here.,8
Pant with a strategy to just annoy the batsman,3
"Come on Neesh, I am sure you don't want another super over",2
inb4 super over? inb4 super over,2
"Ik it's off-topic but can't wait for the match threads for our Test series down-under.

Everyone shut up already these two are doing fine.,2
Neesham badly wants another super over,2

"The match was over when Rabada did not bowl over Deshpande in the second over. The tide shifted when Ashwin did not bowl the first over over Deshpande.

And then we put the winning touches by bowling Stoinis. 

I cannot believe how stupid our management is and here we are sitting on top of the table lol.",0
Come on panty keep awowing. But catch the ball also damn it.,3
[deleted],1
The batting falls of a cliff after this. We need one wicket,4
Anyone else remember when hooda looked like a future India T20 player when he used to play for rajasthan?,4
Neesham loves a super over doesn't he,1
So it's on the newcomer Sams to make something happen? A lot of fucking pressure,2
Hooda Bhenchod hit some fours,1
13 off 15 now,2
Slowly slowly we will become  true RCB from fake RCB,1
Fuck everyone bullying Pant. Him shouting is the most entertaining shit.,1
"One wicket, Kings XI directly land in the hairy part of the tail",1
"If KXIP looses, I blame Maxwell. He had no business playing that shot after scoring a boundary.",2
Pant uses so much energy in ranting behind the stump than keeping the wicket,4
this is going to the last over I guess......,3
Hotstar really the biggest jinxers around. Everytime they send a notification about a player. He gets out,6
Not very confident are we,8
My fucking god. It's happening,3
Bruh how do you take 35 of 42 balls deep? Even Thala would struggle with that,11
Are they ssly losing this?,4
Yep they gonna choke for sure now,5
"I know it's Punjab, but I somehow can't not trust Neesham to be smart here",6
Thank god,7
Thank God hooda.,7
Finally,8
I was just following reddit thread and cricbuzz but had to switch on Hotstar to listen to Pant noises,7
Lmao kxip losing this,2

They always find some way to make match interesting.,3
Rishabh '*dBSPL*' Pant,3
Punjab better win this.,6
Yes its happening. Sigh not again.,6
YESSSS HOODAAAA,9
Proper timing from Hoods that,2
"Okay Mr Ricky Ponting, its about time we should drop Shaw from the team. A 19/20 yr old should not be an undisputed starter after these performances.",9
My mom woke up from sleep to ask us mute the weird sounds,11
Thank God,3
Hooda 9(17),5
Finally a boundary,6
KXIP should be doing it quick to get that sweet NRR they're already 3 overs late,5
Who is going to pay for our medical support? Supporting KXIP is not for the weak hearted. We need an insurance,8
"fuck me i thought the plan was not to get to the last over

and they're still going to do that",8
Eaaaazy 4,4
Omg come on. We can't lose from here,9
Last ball finish?,5
5 overs ago we were talking about nrr. Classic kxip,7
Kxip can't lose now. Can they?,2

"If you think about all the banter games Kings managed to bottle this season

They really should be up near the top of the table....",6

KXIP better win in this over. They can really mess up in last over.,6
So maxi lives for another day?,3
"If there's one team that can blow a 4 RRR game, That's KXIP lmao",7
Man Gayle was the difference in the match. He ensured they were never under pressure. And Delhi was always playing catchup,7
Deshpande's 41 really hurt Delhi today,5
What's the lowest team score when one of the batsmen scores a century?,3
Remember punjab went from  2 in 6 to 1 in 1 with Gayle and Rahul. The game is still on!,3
"KL really needs to be relieved from captaincy , he isn't playing his natural game ,the team lacks that killing instinct under him .",5

There's no need to put your fans through another last over thriller.",9
"Oh wow we wanted to finish the overs of our fifth bowler early in the game who won’t even finish his quota anyway!

Learn you dumb fucks or go out in the playoffs again!",-3
Deepak Hooda is so trash. Watch KXIP somehow go out of the tournament on NRR,2
Remember when the NRR talks started to surface in this thread? lmaooo,6
Punjab's only tough matches left are KKR & RR they can win 3 more,4
Finish it this over!,9
"KXIP fans and sweaty palms, name a more iconic duo.",8

Man KL must've lost a lot of weight this season cuz of all the stress,7
"If neesham loves reddit, he will take this to super over just for the memes.",23
good fielding rahane,3
All neesham is thinking about is super over.,18
"KXIP stomped MI, then DC, inclusion of Gayle really did wonders to the team didn't it",21
Punjab dressing room atmosphere looks like they are the ones defending lmao,18
sadge,6
Dhawan went off the field... He's like fuck it,5
"Hotstar comments be like ""Rohit Sharma score 100 today""

He is not playing for either of these teams, but okay 😂😂😂",18
An outside edge going for a boundary pls,8
Neesham having no clue where the ball is,10
What is this team man,5
..... Why not go for the 2nd run?,8
Need another wicket to spice things up,4
Fucking hurts everytime the commentators say that if it were any other team we’d be calm,25
KXIP has the same problem India has. None of the bottom 4 have batting capabilities.,16
"So many 2s have been converted into 1s.

*Kohli disapproves*",18
"KXIP play SRH, KKR, RR, CSK next. They can actually do it. Having come off confidence of winning Vs RCB , MI and DC now",14
Neesham batting like Tailender,7
Perfectly set up for a hat-trick,4
bc just play a game normally sometimes ffs,11
"Eng vs ind tomorrow.. 

According to bewda Shastri",14
Shitty bowler rotation by Iyer today,5
Pant should be in a biryani ad.,13
how tf did dhawan score 105 out of 165,12
That Lenskart ad of CSK run out chance will never not make me laugh.,12
Maxi pulled his hat down when the camera focused. LMAO,13
Finish it now bois,5
Cmon 3 dot balls,2
DC's not gonna win this keeping the field out. Getting everyone in now and force the equation,2
1 off 3 incoming,4

Pooran not being fed by KXIP. Eating that towel.,6
"In the end, it was a par score had we fielded better and bowling change were more creative.",1
"should bring everyone in 
 
They'll be too nervous to even hit over the field",2
maybe bit of overconfidence from dc today,3
"Ngl, Maxwell really had me in his first half of the innings. He was sensible, playing according to situation, I was like Damn, he changed for good.",7
Fucking finish it in these 3 balls,4
"Fellow redditor Neesham, living on edge of what he has feared most...",3
Kinda hoping it can go down to 1 off 3 again so that KXIP can get a shot to shake their past demons,2
Neesham thinking of all memes if he manages to take this match till super over,9
Not this over...not like this,6
My heart is racing. This team will be the end of me,7
Why is Shreyas wearing 3 caps at the same time,6
We gotta make runs in this over. Don't take it to the last over,1
Any other team and you'd have know by the 13th over that this game was done. But with punjab you have to watch this till the last ball to be sure.,11
Taking it deep,4
"Is that refrigerator just a sponsor thing ??? 


I wouldn't imagine players playing to be running around drinking cola during the game",1

Stoinis to do it again?,1
KXIP the Robin Hood team of the season,6
Punjab beating the two “unbeatable” table toppers has to be peak 2020,20
Thank you camera man.,3
"Taking it deep, eh ?",3
Fucking Hooda...,1
1 of 3?,3
Hooda fooda,1
Iyer wearing 2 caps doesn't give double brains. Should have got Rabada sooner,6
Pls bowl five wides,5
Is DC's time over? Marvel's doing really good these days,8
Deepdar Hoodhav,2
This is why I think DC is really good team but still not indestructible like MI.MI is better than them and if these 2 teams play the final 99.99% MI is going to win and not just for DC if MI qualifies for final they are going to win,6
[deleted],4
Lmao,2
Lmao 5 off 8 😂😂,6
Dc wants to lose,3
Oh boi stoinis!,7
Stoinis the FUCK,2

Meanwhile KXIP : we don't do that here",1

Aah Jimmy....knows how to steal the show,1

Yeah yeah games done. Show the girl now ffs,3
KXIP made this chase look so much harder than it was LMAO,1
In an alternate timeline stoinis took the catch and the game is now hurtling towards super over,2
Shoutout Nicky pooran,3
I am crying. We didn't take it into the last over. Love you Quiche,4

Neesh said fuck yall I ain't doing another superover cya,10
Neesham: Fuck super overs,19
No Super over today? Kudos KXIP ! Well Played now qualify for playoffs!,5
Lmao neesham was done with all the close finishes,10
I'm just thankful they did not take it to the last over.,6
Let's go!,1
Mahendra Singh Neesham finishes it off in style!,9
FUCK OFF STOINIS,3
"Neesham getting over his DEMONS, with a Six",3
Okay. So not going to last over then,1
Neesham had a killer game in the end! Broke the opening partnership with the ball and hit the winning runs with the bat.,7
"Neesham is like ""hatt bc, twitter pe online jana hai jaldi khatam kar""",10
Neesh didnt want it to take it to the last over.,4
"Well......that was anti-climatic

KXIP has spoiled me for dramatic finishes with their other matches",7
See SRH? That's how you win when you lose early wickets,6
KXIP knows how to take it deep.. just finish it for god’s sake,2
Yeah Neesham's NEVER gonna take it till the end. Fuck that,7
"Yes baby. We're coming for playoffs. KKR, we'll have your spot kindly",11
"Can’t choke in the final over, if you finish the game in the 19th.",15
Can't believe KXIP took it to the 19th over almost. They will choke one day again if they keep doing this.,5
"Reddit is proud of ya ,neesham",7
DC lost because of poor captaincy in this match,6
KXIP just needed a Universe Boss to start winning.,20
"If any of DC, MI or RCB win this year, we have already defeated them, therefore KXIP is the rightful winner of Dream11 IPL 2020. Don't @ me",19
Take that 6 Aakash Chopra,11
Jimmy 'Fuck this shit I am dead inside' Neesham not taking any chances,21
Thank you Neesh. Proud of you.,5
Cameraman zooming on 'logo' lmao,9
Somebody check KL's blood pressure please.,11
"KXIP's chase didn't finish in the 20th over? No super over? 

Somebody pinch me.",15
 Redditor has finished the game so it doesn't go into last over and pressure of potential super over is evaded,13
I'm still in awe of KXIP bowling performance. How the fuck did they do that? 😯,9
Now people will understand why SRH fans hate Hooda so much. Fucking useless player who never played a single decent innings for us for I think 3 years he has been with us.,14
Where tf is he focusing lol,11
Neesham be like not on my watch again.,8
"If KKR loses tomorrow's game, Punjab have a super good chance",8
"Kxip wins

Happy KL comes for interview.",15
rcb boiiiis win tomorrow and we're on par with table toppers B),11
"Tbf the gayle over turned the tide, never did their rr drop after that until the end",17
When you're a Reddititor and hence know the cheat code for KXIP is finishing before 20th,35
is Neesham the whitest cricketer ever?,9
Neesham’s had enough of last over finishes,26
Kxip : The duality of man,12
Lmfao it would've definitely gone to a super over had Stoin held on,10
Jimmy not interested in super over,16
"*The redditor finishes it off in style.. 

A magnificent strike into the crowd

KXIP lift the world cup after 97 years*",41
"The stars have aligned for KXIP to win this league. Even in the last match, they got so much lucky. We couldn't score any in the last 2 overs. God literally wants them to win this cup this year.",10
KXIP need to target to finish chases in 19th over so they don't unnecessarily drag it and choke,10
LETS GO NEESHAM,6
"stoinis had us in the first few seconds, ngl",13
MOM Pooran?,5
We shouldve been at 14 points *sigh*,15
I'm impressed. Finally not a last ball finish.,10
Kxip middle order confirmed,14
Needed this reality check. Few areas of improvement and need to change middle over mindset.,8

They are actually pulling off an MI 2015.",12
Surprisingly Maxwell batted well today. He can become a bowling all rounder if he keeps this up,19
Hooda looking like a clone of Purab Kohli (the rock on guy) out there,6
If RCB dont win tmr we riot,12
"Gayle playing from game 1, little bit of luck, no team would've dared touch KXIP",12
"It cant be so easy

It is so unlike kxip",5
"gg boys, onto the next one!",6
"That was a team performance from KXIP tbh, everyone contributed in some way. I guess MOTM is Pooran",6
cameraman focusing on zinta melons lmao,20
"That was the most atrocious display of captaincy I have seen all season.

Literally a random bowler selector would have bowled Rabada earlier to take out Pooran and Maxwell lol.",1
"Ahem to people who think that DC fan(s) are cocky: 

I have been highly successful in life being cocky. It’s better than being under confident if you want my take on things.

Regarding DC, they should run away with the tournament but the management is really questionable at times so I doubt it. This is a better DC team for example:

Stoinis (Shaw is super unreliable)
Dhawan
Rahane
Iyer
Pant
Hetmyer
Axar
Ashwin
Nortje 
Rabada
Ishant Sharma

I don’t see this team losing too many games despite Iyer who doesn’t use his strike bowlers before the match the over.

But oh well, it is what it is.",0
Harshal Patel >> Deshpande,1
KXIP NRR goes from -0.262 to -0.177,7

Redditor making us proud !!!,7
"So who won today's IPL match?

Punjab in 5th... Hope them and RR put up a fight against KKR.,5
"bottom team of ipl beats top 3 teams of the ipl (rcb, mi , dc)",12
I know the two Tushar overs went for plenty but this was a good wicket which needed 180+,6
Unleash some hugs n kiss for our quiche,3
[r/cricket right now seeing neesham finish the game](https://images.app.goo.gl/kkQEt3W42cPr6moq9),5
"Who Punjab thought would have won them games:Maxwell



Who actually is winning games for them:Gayle",14
Kumble has lead RCB to finals from a similar position before. He will do it again with Punjab too. Trust the AK!,11
The gap between top and middle teams are shrinking. Even more if KKR wins tomorrow.,3
It was the redditor,7
What's the last word written on the IPL trophy ?,3
Hope mayank is not injured. Will hampers Punjab's chance. And India have that tour of Aus too.,6
KX can actually qualify. Next matches arent that difficult if they have beaten MI and DC already.,3
Kxip: to be or not to be,5
Neesham had it with last overs shit,12
10 runs short? lol you guys were 30 runs short.,10
Well deserved loss. Hopeless batting barring Shikar. Didn't grab our chances in the field.,5
Damn imagine Punjab with 6 more points this time. Shit why you fuck up so bad at start Punjab.,9
"Team effort to lose this, everyone played their part in fucking up (except for Dhawan)",10
Only 10 runs short? No way,8
Imagine getting hit for a 6 by a redditor LMAO,54
Kings XI beat the top 2 teams in a space of 2 days. I’m gonna lie on that thought till I absorb it fully,11
Lmao Gayle made a Burj Khalifa out of the runs per over stats,23
only if srh didnt lose to kkr ....,4
And mandeep is better than hooda,17
That catch could've given us a tight game.,7
Lmao r/cricket being happy for Neesham being a redditor as if we've coded the codebase of the website,16
I feel RCB might lose tomorrow Ferguson is in form & Narine will be back they only need to get our top 4 out.,10
Everyone is praising Pooran but don't forget Universe Boss and his small but effective cameo!,18
"As someone predicted, Iyer did point out Tushar.

Come on iyer! Don't do that",46
Gayle is a game changer,23
With this Neesham has also hit more sixes this game than Maxwell has hit this entire fucking season,25
KXIP should have won in 15 overs,10
Just open with gayle and get mandeep in for hooda and they are good.,6
RCB should do new RCB a favor and win tomorrow. Then KXIP qualification will be in their hands,13
Proof that ipl squads need to recruit more redditors,16
"Good win for KXIP. Their top 4 are in tremendous form. While their bowling has holes their batting is as good as any other team. If RCB beats KKR tomorrow, KXIP can take their destiny in their control by beating KKR.",10
WASTED Dhawan man. But GG Punjab. Hope we learn from it,11
"KL doesn’t perform -> KXIP wins, Pooran scores 50, Maxwell starts to show some signs. See y’all at r/conspiracy",29
KKR it's up to you now. Gotta win tomorrow. To keep it interesting.,4
Kohli please win tomorrow! do it for your ancestors,25
"Kxip last 3 victories. 


RCB 3rd in table

MI 2nd in table

DC table topper. 

Aap chronology samaj lijiye",31
Happy for Coach Kumble,5
"Punjab has now won against RCB , MI and DC.",19
"Man I'm happy for KL, dude started to look depressed as fuck.",47
Sams should get another match or 2. Didn't expect to be saying that 90mins ago,6
"Harshal Patel is a seasoned campaigner.. he needs to play ahead of a rookie like Tushar.

I understand if Harshal completely flops, then you can get Tushar",10
I feel like Pooran & Rahul look similar a lot.,17
The main reason DC lost this is the collective failure of its batting barring Shikhar,8
Well DC. Bowlers can't pull you out every matches. Literally don't remember the last time batsman did well.  The RCB game probably?,8
Fellow redditor had mercy on our hearts and finished it before 20th,24
"Oh god, thank you! Unleash the quickieeee",14
"I’m glad we lost. Prithvi, Iyer and Pant need to step up. Very shitty batting bar Dhawan, everyone left it on him to hit boundaries.",25
"I hate super overs almost as much as you do, thanks Neesham",26
"Damn, Iyer shouldn't have mentioned Deshpande by name, won't help his confidence",10
iyer personally apologising to u/singhsrb,11
"Jimmy Neesham: Fine, i'll do it myself.",16
That game against KKR if won by KXIP would have made for quite a different story at this point .,17
"Man as a KKR fan, I want KXIP to qualify. They are slowly performing together as a team and not just one or two player performance anymore.",17
Offtopic - Can you now use Netflix and Prime Video on Mi TV?,5
"While I think Pooran's innings was absolutely vital, Chris Gayle's attack to the newbie firing 26runs in a single over, after a slow start was a match defining moment as well. Put some respect on the Universe Fucking Boss !",26
Punjab now have won against all of the top 3 team this season. Hoping for a good run.,24
"Gayle

Rahul (to break kohlis 900 record or let Mayank open)

pooran sounds like shaggy,5
"With that loss, we are just as good as MI and DC",15
Kxip: Schrödinger's match,10
Feels weird to see us win without having my heart in my mouth. More of this please!,12
"DC can choke here their next matches are against KKR, MI, RCB & SRH",15
"Pooran and Gayle- 82 runs from 41 balls
Everybody else- 85 runs from 73 balls",17
I like how I support teams that can help my team to gain/maintain the position.,9
Y'all think Nortje instead of Tushar would have changed anything?,9
"DC needs Pant to deliver. He just has not fired this IPL. Shaw has also mostly disappointed except one MOM performance. If these 2 can perform, DC will finish in Top 2. Otherwise a finish outside Top 2 would need 3 wins to win IPL. Wont be easy in play offs. My money is on MI or RCB to win it all.",8
Why wasn't Nortje playing?,7
"Those who are shouting this is DC's IPL, just think if Dhawan is not scoring - your batting is shit.",11
"I hope Rahul never plays anchor, today middle order did well",13
u/unleashthequiche decent effort,11
Iyer always calls out players who didn’t perform. He also had an outburst when they missed a run out. He consistently facepalms at every misfiled and points at the fielders who make mistakes. Rahul seems to be a much calmer and collected captain. DC is doing better than KXIP not because of Iyer’s captaincy but because DC is objectively stronger than KXIP.,25
How does this win shape up for this resurgent Kings XI to potentially make it to the top 4?,7
Is neesham a proper batsman?,3
Dhawan literally carried entire Delhi batting today. They need to do some introspection. This will not work at big stage.,21
Do we have a 5th bowling option we can try?,5
All round team performance >>> individual brilliance. Well done KXIP.,21
They should go easy on deshpande. In an inform Kxip batting lineup least explosive guy is KL ... If not him they would've  went after somebody else.,10
"Punjab, win it for the sadbois",6
"I can't believe that Maxwell finally scored double digits

Still waiting for that six",22

"To KXIP fans not satisfied with this win - winning in the 19th over is significantly more convincing than winning it in the 2nd Super over. They're starting to gain serious momentum now and look like they can actually turn it all around. One game at a time, guys. Well done KXIP!",56
"Shreyas' first bad game as captain this season. I think DC lost the game in the two Tushar overs, particularly the first one. You don't gift 30 runs to Gayle in the powerplay.  Match could have been different had Ashwin bowled to Gayle as soon as he came in.",14
"Yes I am the cocky fan which makes the whole fan base look toxic but I would be lying if actually think we will win anything with Iyer at the helm and our management. 

Like they come out of the strategic timeout and bowl Stoinis when the match literally running away from them and calling out loud for a Rabada over.

We have been winning because we have a great squad even with our atrocious game management. But it will catch us good in the playoffs is my realistic prediction unless things change dramatically which seems unlikely to be honest.",2
[u/unleashthequiche](https://www.reddit.com/u/unleashthequiche/) no super over when i am here.,10
Does Punjab still have a chance?? To make it to top 4??,4
I guess DC batsmens inexperience is starting to show,13
I have never been pinged in reddit.. can someone ping me,13
I wonder if KXlP of 2020 would become the best team in the history to not qualify for playoffs.,25
"Other than KKR fan , everyone will be supporting RCB.",24
Punjab has now beaten all the three top teams and yet is scrambling for the fourth spot. Really hope they make it,40
KKR better win tomorrow,-25
momentum is everything in this tournament and i hope kxip can keep it up,13
Who'll be man of the match?,2
Supporting underdogs is always fun,18
"Well people say "" *Do not count the chickens before they are hatched* ""

But boys I'll see you in the finals. See ya !",25
"Mayank, KL, Gayle, Pooran, Maxi - KXIP has such a fine batting lineup. Looks like they r finally getting their shit together",35
"man with the platform Dhawan gave us, we could have easily pushed to 200 with slightly better batting. Interested to see how we respond against KKR",24
Lol Brian Lara's pants 😂,9
"If this is what it takes to kick Shaw out of the team, I am all for it!",16
"Iyer: I'm glad we took it to the end.
Umm no, KX took it to the end.",44
"Ffs iyer proper kohli, with the 10 run short nonsense",21
Kxip has usually been so mediocre that no one even memes it enough while rcb gets picked on. Lol I’m happy that we’re atleast entertaining enough this time,29
"KXIP is the MI from 2014 season, what a comeback. Rising from ashes like a Phoenix. Damn",51
CSK will qualify for play-offs,-42
"Come on RCB and Kohli, de Villiers and DDP, depending on you guys to handle KKR tomorrow.",37
"From blaming avesh in 2018 to backing tushar now, Iyer has come a good long way of being a mature captain",18
Tushar recently said that he and Shreyas are not good friends. Damn the captain really threw him under the bus today.,31
Having a really young side has its pros and cons. We've already seen the pros but now I guess the cons have started to show more.,23
"Punjab now really deserves the 4th spot, although I support KKR.",37
"Hey, that's the guy from EA Cricket 2007.",30
"Boy, Hooda is one lucky boi today. He tried his level best to give us another super over",67
"We couldve been at 14 points *sigh*

Finally a game where we didnt have to rely on our openers

Gayle's over of Tushar changed the game 

Glad Maxwell played the way he did, and I hopw this is the turning point for him. His last 12 overs have been very crucial as well. Economy of 7. 

So do you lot think we have reached our best XI for rest of the tournament? I dont think Neesham gets dropped after this. 

Hooda, idk, still not confident. Hes been very lucky too many times. We already have an offie in Maxwell as well.",40
Pooran for MotM?,14
Dhawan is the new Tendulkar XD,20
So tomorrow who are you supporting guys? (Non RCB and KKR fans),14
IPL needs to be sued for not having Mark freakin Nicholas all these years before!!,23
KXIP is like that backbencher who just want to spoil toppers mood.,33
"DC with its jackshit batting is going to get exposed this season. Only so many times your bowling can save you. Shaw, Iyer, Pant, Stoinis all getting figured out and exposed. Gonna be nasty in the playoffs for DC. MI will be licking their lips.",27
"This is what happens when you back your guy. Maxwell was Giving his 200%, though dwarfed by Pooran and universe boss innings, got us 36 in 24 just by running. Man had fight in his eyes",40
"rahul - you always want your batters to bat


**the insight**",34
Will teams now rethink their strategy of batting first after winning toss? It's weird seeing teams not preferring to chase in T-20.,13
Probably helps that Maxwell has Rahul as captain. No one knows about having a lean patch more than Rahul. Boy he went through a lot last year.,34
"What a talent Pooran is for WI. He is going to be their most important batsman next decade for WI. They are building serious talent with Holder being a great leader as well. There is Cotrell, Gabriel, Roach and Roston Chase(all rounder). Short form they have Pollard leading the team who adds a layer to the team as well. I hope they continue to thrive and we get bowlers like Holding/Ambrose again. They are so exciting to watch.",35
I am already looking for forward to the test matches where at least Kohli attacks with the fast bowlers after looking at how Iyer thinks Rabada is some miracle worker who will win him matches after they have been already lost.,12
wait how is shikhar motm?!!,11
Lol Shikhar’s cheque says KXIP,15
Dhawan just won MoM,18
How tf does your previous match score matter in being motm wtf 😂😂,16
"That smile, that damned smile. Such a lovely character Dhawan, so likeable.",13
"I don't want to be a buzzkill, but in 2010 DC had 14 points after 10 games, and still missed out on top4.",33
Dhawan has such a calming effect. His kids must be sleeping before he finishes 2 sentences,27
Being captain from outside really needs to be a job considering how shit folks are at it lol.,5
"Gotta appreciate for the efforts of KXIP, it takes huge balls to lose your initial games and then win every game by defeating top teams. KXIP you have my respect as a MI fan",41
I really want DC admin to release dressing room talk today. Ponting should give mouthful to all the batters.,28
"So how good are KXIP's playoff chances?

Edit: now I kinda want them to win",2
Shikar was great today but one good throw from him could've turned the match in our favor. But anyways this KXIP win is best for the tournament.,23
Wasn't Evin Lewis picked up by any team? I remember he played for MI,5
"Shaw should be rightfully dropped now, even if Rahane don't score runs he will save 6-10 runs by his fielding",18
"I actually want the people who disagree with me to find one match where Iyer bowled Rabada when the match was not already over (won or lost) in the second innings. 

The closest one is the KKR Sharjah game and we even won that even though 3 sixes were hit off Rabada so that one was also over as far as I am concerned.

It’s actually astounding how bad these guys are at using Rabada lol.",10
DC drop pant(s) to assert dominance.,15
"Big shout-out to the DC fan who made that thread before Kxip Vs MI  praising DC for having a different MOTM every match and dissing Kxip for being a 2 man show. 



Reverse jinxed whole squad to form 👍",72
[deleted],-1
"CSK and MI win tournaments because they simply use all their prime resources to change the match till they can well.

Even yesterday, Dhoni bowled out Hazlewood and Chahar which was really the only way to win the match. I can never imagine Iyer and DC management bowling out Rabada in the first 10 as an example.",23
"Gayle can have the same impact on kxip as he did on Rcb in 2011. Before he joined, rcb were crap but he turned them around. Pooran was great today but Gayle gave them initial momentum",35
"If Mumbai faces Punjab in playoffs in Dubai, Mumbai is fuked",29
"You can't be blaming Tushar for the DC's loss, it was the batsman's fault for not sticking around with Dhawan. This dude is playing his first IPL and bowled against the Universe Boss. What else would you expect? Gayle targeted him as he was the weak link in the bowling line up and it paid off. Iyer should not have pointed him out.",38
Thing with kxip is we’re a schrodinger’s team like someone said here. We’ll beat all the greats and then get a 10 wicket loss from thala XI,53
"Time to go back to work and be competent at it unlike Iyer and DC management!!

See ya later folks :)",13
The single biggest problem today with DC was that they didn’t target the easy bowlers. They were probably pinning all hopes on another death overs bungling but that didn’t happen because Shami,24
Kings 11 is a really good team. I think they deserve to be in top 4. I think SRH and CSK are the only poor teams this season.,41
"I have to say, as with the match with MI, the match threads are really great, haven’t seen many toxic fans. CSK and RCB games really do bring out the hate here in r/cricket lol",35
Ok thought experiment- what would’ve happened if Stoinis held onto that catch?,19
"Edit: Yeah my bad. Bowling Tushar in pp may not have been the best decision but its not as bad as i initially thought.

Bowling Ashwin first up against Gayle would have been the killer move though.",-14
Bring Karun in place of hooda,3
"Holy shit, tomorrow's match will decide if, there is fight for no.4 on point table or not",20
Any update on Mayank's fitness? He was hobbling after the run out.,20
"Uhhh, wow

KXIP, which was the last place team just a while ago, just beat #1, #2, and #3 seeds in the standings.

Just goes to show how unpredictable this beautiful game could be.",46
Nice match,10
"I so love UAE as the venue for IPL, not a single match washed out or curtailed!",52
r/cricket will go bonkers if CSK somehow still manages to qualify.,31
How many times a player won MoM in IPL when his team lost?,42
"Gayle: * Looks at Deshpande * 





*imma end this man's whole career*",88

Can I know who unleash the quiche is?,1
