Punjab to win and Delhi Capitals will remain the only team to not have dropped points,2
Jos Buttler + Sanju Samson + Small ground = really happy Rajasthan,24
Since I‚Äôm here early... UPVOTE THE MATCH THREAD!,5
"Gonna be a runfest! KL,Buttler,Samson and others",1
Both teams have likeable characters.  I'm a esp. a fan  of Smith and Rahul.  So not sure whom to support.,7
Rajsthan shud put on a show with bat tonight n prove the last game wasnt just one of those off days.,29
[deleted],8
~~robbin~~ robbie uthappa's  9(20)  incoming in 3..2...,13
Playing at Sharjah is a lot like the eating of an Orange,17
Samson vs KL . Thats it.,3
[deleted],7
"If Neesham plays then whole r/cricket is supporting Punjab right? 

Though I really want to see Buttler hitting some of those sixes as well.",9
Wonder if Buttler will replace Neesham?,-6
Small ground so good chance we might pick Gayle. Hopefully there is a Gayle storm tonight,11
"waiting for those sweet matchups...


KL vs archer

shami vs Samson 

shami vs butler",10
"Samson must have a great pr team

Might be the most overrated ipl player",6
"If Gayle plays, free early wicket for Royals. I feel punjab will go with an unchanged squad.",3
"Sharjah against KXIP, we need to bring best game of ours on field tonight",4
"And this is the game I've been waiting for. It was sort of a toss up between RR and KXIP, Buttler sealed the deal. Those eyes! Just so pretty in pink.",28
"Neesham vs Archer....""he's got it it's huge""",3
KLPDians vs Smithians. Clash of the new Titans.,6
"Maybe if I just go in with a losing mindset, I‚Äôll be fine when it ends",6
Scenes if Neesham gets dropped for Gayle lmao,5
[deleted],1
So its twitter vs reddit tonight,3
"Gayle could play his 1st game this season today. 

Lots of similarities in both teams.

Boss vs Jos(who's certain to play his 1st this season), 

Archer vs Shami, 

KL vs Samson and 

2 leggies on both sides too.",3
yashavi jaiswal ( RR opener) looks very much like the [Tamil actress gayathri ](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Gayathrie&iax=images&ia=images),3
Should replace Pooran with Gayle imo. This pitch is for him.,2
"After the spanking Kumble gave Kohli, he might be feeling so giddy he will pick Gayle.",2
[I stumbled across this and I have been laughing for 5 minutes straight](https://np.reddit.com/r/LadyBoners/comments/1aurke/steve_smith_never_fails_to_get_me_wet/),5
"Since there has been some disapproval over post match threads for this years IPL [here is the official template](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/akmiq8/meta_making_post_match_threads_more_detailed/). Earlier today I posted the post match thread for the Australia, New Zealand match but don't think I'll make it to the end of this match.",3
So are we gonna follow the win toss-lose game theme again today?,3
Jaiswal out what,8
JOS BUTTLER IN BOIS,2
"jasiwal out :( should've dropped uthappa, smudgy.",13
So RR won toss and KXIP gonna win match?,3
"Uthappa retains his place

Big lol",10
No questions about team to KL?,6
Stupid Slater didn't ask Rahul about KXIP changes,11
Hold on he didn‚Äôt ask about changes in our team loooool,5
Feel sorry for Miller,4
Yashavi Jaiswal with his hair and skinny frame looks like [Ram & Lakshman in religious drawings.](https://i.imgur.com/QZZM8tY.jpg),2
Smith and Butler to open then.,1
Can't believe Jaiswal got dropped,10
"ffs slater, forgot to ask KL abt the team changes! brb, checking cb",10
I'm reeeeally looking forward to this match. God almighty knows how much I want a close game. Please make it happen guys. Good luck to both teams and fans!,3
Is gayle in?,2
Here to witness Smith vs. Shami. A nice juicy preview of the upcoming test match series.,8
Why isn't Gayle playing,3
How good is Rajpoot ? In place of Jaiswal...,4
No changes for Punjab.,4
"Star Sports is the gold standard of content. There was a picture of all the batsmen with CGI clouds crackling above, ""Storm in Sharjah"".",5
"Why isnt Slater fired from the toss yet?? 

Twice he hasnt asked caps abt changes.",8
Slats had one job ffs,7
Apparently KXIP is unchanged so gotta wait more for Gayle :(,3
We are back on Sharjah run fest ground,2
personally I'd rather  play with 10 players than play with robbie ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2
Uthappa who isn't even timing the ball is in the team while Jaiswal is out. Smh!,3
I had mujeeb in the fantasy league u pussies make him play,4
My body is ready for the run fest,1
Is Samson still keeping?,1
Jaiswal seems like an awkward introvert,2
They aren‚Äôt bringing in Gayle because then they‚Äôll have to remove Pooran but he‚Äôs got more runs than Maxwell who the fans like a lot more. 8D chess right there,2
"Strangely the team with highest score this season seems to have a weak batting line up today

Two quick wickets at the top n u r into uthappa",6
"KXIP: no changes, Kumble doesn't like changes that much.",4
Tf I tuned in to see jaiswal play mf.,4
NO UNIVERSE BOSS! I WANTED TO BLUSH SO BAD BABY!,8
"Why has Smith started opening? Shouldn't he be in middle order where he could provide stability. Drop Robbie. Open with Yashasvi.

Or is he trying to emaluate Warner- Bairstow kind of partnership with Buttler-Smith.",4
Do we have no one to replace Unadkat,3
Nit Reverse sweep manga sonya ve teri dua ni koi hor mangdi,5
Replacing a opening batsman with a bowler.. brain fade from Smudge,3
Guys where is Ben Stokes?? I checked the squads on Cricbuzz yesterday and his gorgeous mug was right next to Butler‚Äôs. Now he doesn‚Äôt even exist in the squad WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON üò≤,1
No Gayle? What has this up-and-coming youngster got to do to break into the KXIP XI? His stats suggest he is good.,4
Imo the Jaiswal decision is a good one. This ground probably needs him to start hitting from ball one which is gonna be hard for a debutant. So I could see them wanting to introduce him back in the other grounds where he has more time in the middle.,1
"Can't believe they benched Jaiswal to play the fossil that is Robin Uthappa, he is way past it and can do nothing but suck any momentum out of the innings with the bat, Jaiswal's an opener but they could've used him as a floater",8
Missed opportunity of Gayle and Rahul opening on this ground,2
"Can‚Äôt believe I am super excited about RR vs KXIP match. Before the start of tournament, these were the two teams I cared least about.",3
Samson to open? Rather have jaiswal at open so smith can drop lower to be a finisher,2
"RR have so many options instead of Robbie,

Mahipal Lomror

Anuj Rawat

Manan Vohra",4
Last night I dreamt that Hardik Pandya started a new Yeehaw phase after he got bored of the Caribbean facade,2

If maxwell plays poor even in small ground then throw him out,1
"Taking out Jaiswal is only reason I will be supporting KXIP today

Before this I was happy to be neutral",6
"Buttler should open, not smith",2
What‚Äôs gayle even doing in the team if you‚Äôre not gonna play him on this ground after consecutive failures for pooran,2
is porel playing?,1
Last night I dreamt that Kohli has stared opening his Post match interviews with Inshalla boys played well,4
Last game was just a tool to build my hopes. I'm ready to be disappointed again. Give it to me. Lay it on me.,5
Good decision to stick with this team from Punjab. Outside Karun we really have 6 batsman all capable of hitting. Bowling as always seems thin but so far in a short while has been the best so far in the tournament,1
Final will be played between these 2 teams.,0
"After Smith, Buttler and Samson, our batting is shit. Kings have a good chance of winning.",2
Final will be played between these 2 teams.,-3

these are the changes I would have made        
Gayle for Neesham        
Hooda for Nair",2
"Gayle couldn't have played worse than Pooran, right?
I know that Pooran is capable T20 player, but he seems to be out of form.",3
Damn the pressure on Buttler must be immense today lmao,6
"Smith Dropped Jaiswal





What a clownüò≠üò≠",7
"Heart says Robbie is going to roll back the years, head says he is going to screw over the chase.",4
Smith making controversial decisions again. Love it,1
Idk bakut you guys. But I was dying to see ankit Rajput back in action again.,1
Take all the balls you want to settle Maxi. Just want to see you blast boundaries all over the ground.,3
All The KL fanbois and (girls) Join r/KXIP,1
"Uthappa should open with buttler at least for today, double fucking pivot. Samson and smith to follow",1
"I don‚Äôt think the Jaiswal and Rajpoot swap is a bad move. Yes, they should back Jaiswal but this is sensible for team balance in order to counter Kings XI‚Äôs batting and give themselves an extra pace option. They can bring back Yashasvi when it‚Äôs time.",5
"Scuse me ladies and gentlemen, I was away for ""hygienic reasons""

so I've just seen the line-up. WHY THE FUCK ARE WE PLAYING WITH ONLY 4 BATSMEN??!!!",4
I'm honestly very annoyed they aren't playing Jaiswal. I wanted to watch him open the batting with Jos,4
Robbie - Throbbie or Utthappam today?,2
"[They two teams are lowest valued teams](https://www.statista.com/statistics/805534/india-franchise-value-of-different-teams-in-ipl-by-team/).

"I was looking forward for Jaiswal to play. They should have dropped Uthappa. If Steve Smith is opening, he needs to be fired.",2
Smith and Buttler opening. Dream team,6
Barbies dropped jaiswal and my support..,1
Would love it if KL scores another 100 (provided RR wins),0
Is it me or is Tom Curran batting at 6 too high?,7
how does uthappa keep getting selected lol,3
"players still on the bench that i'd love to see at the IPL:

* MI: Coulter-Nile
* CSK: Santner 
* KXIP: Porel
* KKR: Ferguson
* RR:  Tyagi
* RCB:  Ali
* SRH: Stanlake 
* Delhi: Carey",7
Swann is a joker,3
They should just give us the trophy. Why to stress out the other teams so much,1
HALLA BOL ROYALS! We got this!,5
Feeling sad for jaisawal.,5
I‚Äôm grinning like an idiot whenever Buttler‚Äôs onscreen gosh darn it,6
Vohra should be an automatic pick for RR considering the state of their middle order.,2
Butler is OP,5
How many sixes tonight boys??,3
"Open with butler and jaiswal, let Smith take uthapas place",5
To be fair Rajasthan has to buy a rajpoot.,10
"Really disappointed with RR. They've unbalanced their squad big time. Parag is not good enough to bat 5. Curran/Tewatia are not good enough to bat 6, barely justifiable to bat them at 7.

Dropping Miller for Buttler is fine but should've kept Jaiswal and bumped Smithy and Sanju down one. And why bring in Jaydev Unadkat's right handed cousin as an extra bowler? Rajpoot should change his name to Rajpoop it's a more accurate description of his ability",4
Mr Predator in the change room,2
RR is so good this year plus they are likeable too. I wouldnt mind losing to this side.,3
"Our middle order is Robbie, an 18 yr old and 4 players who likes to have a swing.",8
With all this talent I would be disappointed if we don't win at least one of the two back to back T20 WCs,4
/u/lonelyIsland did you just grin like an idiot?,9
"While chasing 214 against RCB last year, LORD Robin Uthappa scored a glorious 9(20).",7
"I still don‚Äôt understand how Tom Curran keeps getting selected internationally/in these tournaments. 

His bowling is consistently very expensive and his batting is only useful.",2
RR has the best jersey in the IPL till date.,7
What was that stare Unadcunt!,4
Bowl Rajput and Unadkat out in first 8 overs.,6
Smith looks a little uneasy in the RR jersey. Maybe it is a size too small or something else is off that I can't put my finger on,8
Seems hasty to drop Yashasvi Jaiswal,7
My money is on RR. They have a strong team,10
butler hinted during interviews after the csk game that he's pretty happy fielding elsewhere on the field. seems like butler as wk has been the plan all along.,7
Shoulda dropped Pooran,1
"If RR wins this, they will be in the Playoffs.",1
Anybody else feels foreigner limit should be increased to 5? Indians would still be majority with 6.,6
Pls get kl's wicket early on ..,4
"Unadkat to bowl 3 overs for 15 in the powerplay, come back in the 16th over and bring up his 50 guaranteed",10
Looks like an electrifying match on the cards after yesterday's snooze fest,10
"Rahul strike rate less than 100, looks to be in terrible form now",9
poor yashaswi. man management is so important this early in a player's career. i really hope it doesn't mess too much with his confidence.,1
"Royals also have the u19 star fast bowler Tyagi

4D Chess Smith is making sure they don't develop too fast, they could be a problem for Australia few years down",9
Archer should bowl with the new ball,5
Wasn‚Äôt this Rajpoot guy a KXIP player?,1
I had a stomach bug once. Did an Ankit Rajpoot and ended up with a Nicholas Pooran,2
Scenes if Rajput mankads KL,3
"I'm not a massive fan of Unadkat early on, yeah have Jofra bowl first and then have no one at the death. No wonder you were a shit T20 captain KP",1
Unadkat has conceded in an over what he usually concedes in half a ball,6
Who are we supporting today?,2
Bowling unadkant and rajpoot will allow these to get their eyes in and then it will be just slaughter.,3
And the thrashing begins,2
great that‚Äôs fucking great,1
"Unadkat 3 runs in an over.


2020 surely is memorable.",1
Where is Sanju fielding? Expect a catch or two!,2
Shot mayank..pls stop,7
Why is Gayle being benched? Imo they should replace him with Pooran for a couple of games.,3
Haha Balaji literally laughing at Badris face after that six.,1
God damn Mayank you‚Äôre making me hard,2
Fuck off raj poop,7
RR must have a lot of trust in their top order to go with that long a tail,7
"Unlike batsmen, bowlers don't perform that well against their previous franchise. Let's see how Rajpoot does here.",2
Inb4 'rajchoot' comments like last year,13
"‚ÄúNot disrespecting Rajpoot‚Äù.

Proceeds to immediately disrespect Rajpoot.",48
RR batting looks weak barring top 3,5
"Bowl pie chuckers whilst all the fielders are up, big brain shit",7
"once you hit 4 6s in an over you are a batsman

Archer can't open the bowling",9
That was a gorgeous looking shot.,5
This is gonna be good man,2
"KP figured out the game, it seems, how to retain commentating contracts. Excessive praise of Dhoni/Kohli, repeating popular-but-cringeworthy phrases, just enough good insights to connect with us resident experts.",7
Rajpoot is a double agent playing for KXIP /s,4
Good comeback so far.,2
Any reason why they can‚Äôt have a small group of fans at matches in UAE? Their covid rate seems fairly low from the numbers,2
"Sarfaraz should be the no. 3 for KXIP. He had a very good domestic season.

KXIP line up looks good
Rahul, Agarawal, Sarfaraz, Nair, Pooran, Maxwell. 

Solid top 6",-1
Wasn‚Äôt Rajput bowling 140s last season ?,1
Ready to see a high scoring game today (from both the sides).,2
Who is more irritating kp or sivaramakrishnan,4
Do RR plan to bowl 30 overs tonight?,1
Ridiculous to think that a third of the 99 sixes came off a single game.,5
thanks for that unadkat,2
"Can‚Äôt afford a car, still downloading the car Dekho app because Dravid asked me to",9
I like Jofra's watch!,1
"While the commentators shit on him, I think that was a very good over by Rajput.",2
man I like KXIP I can‚Äôt even get mad at them,1
Clearly mayank>klpd..dont @me,2
Hoping for a close match today.,1
"Gotta feel sorry for David Miller. Plays one game while Buttler's in quarantine, gets a diamond duck, never plays again",8
If I saw Unadkat at the mall I wouldn't even stop him and ask for a selfie tbh,12
Mayank with the INTENT.,2
Smith going to really bowl Archer all 4 overs in the death overs,0
When will Stokes be available for RR?,1
"Kick in the ass after one failure is the best way to kill the confidence of any player let alone an youngster. 

Smudge should've easily batted 4 and let Jaiswal play as is.",-1
"Archer IPL bowling strikerate- 19.07

Rajpoot IPL bowling strikerate- 19.68

Rajpoot is definitely more sloggable and less intimidating but he regularly takes wickets, not really fair criticism from the commentators.",11
Unadkat trying his outright best will go at 8 an over. Unadkat not giving a fuck will go at 14 an over.,1
"Marcus Harris averages a billion at the MCG and sucks everywhere else

Unadkat is basically the Marcus Harris of bowling. Can only get wickets on one ground",7
"So lads, when is Stokes joining? I see Buttler behind stumps.",3
Wolves : Portugal :: KXI Punjab : Karnataka,1
Maybank will flourish this IPL and forget test batting by Australia Test series. KL 2.0.,4
Did anyone hear the 'hehehehhe'?,3
"To be fair, Pietersen, if Unadkat were bowling at me, I'd hit a textbook perfect defensive shot too.",2
I have a feeling that KL's gonna do a Virat Kohli of 2016 this time,1
Wtf I expected 50 by now,5
"RR batting looks so thin. Uthappa at 5, Curran 6, Tewatia 7.",4
Smithy doesn't bowl Archer and bats him 11 as penance for hitting him in the head,10
Buttler with Test match keeping,11
Samson would have caught that,0
Nice fucking shot that is,3
"Unadkat giving Buttler the staredown. Lol fuck off mate Buttler has like 1000 runs in 2 years, you've given away that many despite being paid much more",9
Agarwal you beauty,6
"that ball was a fucking knobhead, Jos couldn't be bothered",4
Unadkat in form,2
great now my dad‚Äôs busting my balls,2
"One bad over

N lord unadkat making comeback in style",3
who says an Indian passport is useless? Unadkat made millions solely because of his Indian passport.,54
2 sixes = raining sixes?,3
Name an IPL player with a better auction to performance luck than this Unadkat,1
100th IPL six damn that was quick,3
Hot damn kxip is looking so strong this season.,3
"Sad to see RR choosing Robin over Jaiswal. 

Even Tyagi is waiting, who can be given a go in place of Jaidev",4
"Indian batting reserves are great.

Where the all-rounders at?",2
Unadkat back in form,6
Its almost like Unadkat thinks his job is to give away runs..,4
Is it just me or does Unacademy not sound like a place where you learn things?,16
Tara my girl,2
Unadkat in great form. Scoring 17 in an over,2
"I just want Mayank to succeed in Tests. Great batsman, Raina-like on the field, always with the boys and cheering and being a good positive presence. Hope and wish that he continues to has a great test career.",6
This ground is a nightmare for mediocre fast bowlers,2
What the fuck is this bowling,4
<Something derogatory about Unadkat goes here >,2
Looks like the strategy from Punjab is Mayank to go bang bang and KL holds himself for fireworks later.,2
Why the fuck we aren't playing Tyagi in place of unadkat,3
Pls just banish unadkat from the team at this point,3
[deleted],5
Unadkat back in form! Happy!,2
If only we had a world class opening bowler with genuine pace,7
Is there a way to sue Unadcunt for Emotional Distress,3
KL and Agarwal v/s Sanju and Smith tonight. This is set for entertainment,4
Agarwal is like the indian Loosebuschange,3
Lol RR has just 3 batsmen,5
Magnificent,2
"(Agarwal and Rahul) or (Bairstow and Warner)

Which is a better opening combination ?",8
Mayank 100 today,3
Jof wyd,2
KL welcomes Joffra,5
Holy smokes that was gorgeous,8
Chad move,8
Bruh did Rahul just hit Archer for a 4 on his first ball,7
"even Uthappa will be hitting 6s on this ground, RR have so many big hitters KXIP need to get 200 at least",3
There's just no pleasing Pietersen is there,3
Turns out Unadkat's shite is more contagious than coronavirus even Jofra's bowling pies,4
Daddy KL,5
This match feels exciting after the snoozefest of yest,5
This guy is just so good to watch,6
Fucking beautiful shots,3
Yeh toh halwa deta hai,4
Lmao  archer is wearing the same watch he always does but it's pink this time,3
2 sixes but this 2nd drive was shot of the match,5
I‚Äôm hoping that Archer gets smashed here just to prove the commentators wrong.,7
They in now. Bowl peak McGrath on this road and he will go flying too.,1
KXIP plan is clear then  :   attack archer,3
This is fap material.,9
"**KL Rahul has a terrific record vs Jofra Archer in T20s, scoring at a rate of 170+ against him**

Runs 58

Balls 34

Wickets 0",6
r/KXIP just orgasmed,12
YKL Rahul my favourite player.,2
"No not Jofra, he only hope in fast bowling department",1
Classic 2 cover driver from KL .. wow,2
KL is easily the best batsman in India ATM,9
C'mon 3 more KL,2
KL's bunny Jofra?,4
Tf is this bowling Archer!,3
KP wondering why they didn't stick with Ankit Rajpoot,9
Why does KP not understand slower balls?!,6
"Waiting for KP to be like ‚Äúshocking call, Rajpoot should be bowling. Get Jof off‚Äù",11
4 4 4,1
holy shit. jofra getting plastered all over. rare sight.,5
Jofra wants to bat,5
"You‚Äôve to be shitting me, Archer getting hammered",3
Uff KXIP doing well just worries me due to their nature to absolutely fuck up in the 2nd half of the tournament after they dominate the points table in the first half :S,12
Who‚Äôs the female KXIP supporter they keep showing?,4
"I love this stadium, more matches should be held here. I dont miss Chinnaswamy and Wankhede anymore.",7
Maybe this is why Smith didn‚Äôt get Archer earlier.. he knew it,7
just take this win KXIP just take it,5
Maybe Ankit Rajpoot would've been better off bowling this over,5
Both open are looking in terrific touch. Bad news for RR.,4
Sunny ji wildling,1
[deleted],-2
Joff vs Rahul lmao,6
Hope KP is happy rn,2
"Must let KXIP get a huge total so both Buttler and Tom Curran can ton up, I approve of this tactic",9
THICCAPPA,8
That drive is orgasmic,8
Whats your best shot of the IPL so far? Mine is Rayudu's irreverent front foot straight smack off Bumrah's.,2
Someone give tissues to KP .. he is about to cry .. he was rooting for Archer from beginning,7
Glorious cover drives. Man! Whadda player KL is,5
KL is the toughest to bowl - Jofra in an interview,20
Wicket seems to be an absolute asphalt. I‚Äôm more worried about Pooran and Maxwell than KL,4
"Just wanna see Jos on this road now, come on",10
"Man, Kl smacking Starc around the park a couple month's ago was something. Hopefully he keeps this from.",5
"> Jofra's worried about KL Rahul, about how good he is

Kev Jofra's the bloke who decided he'd aim at the best since Bradman's head and pulled it off like fuck he's scared of KL Rahul no matter how good a T20 player he is",9
Why the fuck is he bowling slower balls?,2
Love KP begging for Archer to come into the attack... He's very Mitchell Starcesque. Either an absolute gun or sloppy dross.,2
One more and I'd have called him Jofra Ar4.,6
Rahul really shut KP up there...,10
What commentary is this when Rajpoot was bowling they wanted Jofra now they say he should have stuck with Rajpoot and they act like they know it all,9
Lmao why did he pitch three full length deliveries in a row?,3
"nice comeback from Joff, good over tho",2
KL and Agarwal with 2019 Warner YJB level opening partnership,2
"I was prepared for worse things for rest of the 2020 but was definitely not ready for fake vuvuzela sounds. 

Kill me already.",5
welp. early wickets was RR's only shot here. 200+ loading.,2
"Pietersen-

‚ÄúHow dare Archer not bowl 170 km/h deliveries that swing both ways, spin off the pitch, and then dismiss both batsman at once?‚Äù",155
Bowl spin,1
I wanna see these two teams in final so badly,3
Is Sharjah smaller than even Chinnaswamy?,2
"KL has good record against Jofra, break the batriarchy Archer",1
A common saying in cricket is that left-handers are more elegant than right-handers. That saying is in danger because of KL Rahul. Brilliant stroke play!!,5
KLR has been in form since fuckin forever,2
Im bankin on Gopal for this situation to diffuse,3
arey that bowler from government advertisement.,2
Majestic shots all around,2
Captains are still choosing to chase lol,1
Change my view: bowling first has still been the right option this IPL it's just that virtually no team that's bowled first apart from KKR has actually executed (and they didn't choose to do so). RR doing no different today,1
abhi wicket le lo na yaar bhai kya jaata hai,1
KL is having more than just a purple patch,2
Oh man when are those I don't like the sound/noise comments gonna end,4
"That was a terrible over!!

Of he can't bowl at 140 kmph for 4 overs, why is he playing?",-1
"KL Rahul is really the next great batsman for us, isn't he?",8
These guys might be the best opening duo of this season.,2
Fuck this stadium,8
RR is struggling for team balance without Stokes. Their batting looks really thin without having a decent all rounder.,1
"Unadkat gets slammed on short balls.

Rajput: Bruh how about another short ball",6
Smith will bowl himself at this rate.,7
Poms vs bangbros,4
"These two are definitely going to open for india when they tour Australia, right?",2
Hahahahaha,1
Man oh man it‚Äôs lovely to watch these two,1
Man... Unadkut sucks at fielding too.... why is he in the team again?,0
Unadkat so shit man,1
winning the toss and bowling in sharjah ain't working out too well.,0
These two are a fucking cheat code right now,6
I agree the bowling hasn‚Äôt been ideal but they need to understand that this ground is not kind to the bowlers. Rr could do the same thing if not better,5
"another 230 unsuccessful chase loading, eh bois?",4
This stadium is smaller than my micro peepee,3
Who needs Gayle when these 2 are in this form,3
Fucking Prank Agarwal pranking us outta the match,2
Sanjay Bangar has a good cricketing mind but shouldn‚Äôt be commentating. So uncomfortable now,5
"If Pakistan could participate in the IPL, we could see Rajput bowling to Babar and that would be a nice little historical shout out",121
"Might be a bit early to say, but kxip has finally got their shit together",7
Archer is so bad in the field.,3
Hot potato with that orange cap,5
"How many dot balls will be bowled? I need that 200 bucks from Zomato

25 or less, 26-50, 51-75, 76 or more",4
Was 2018 Pant's best year?,4
"Hitting across the line, through the line are both looking so easy.",1
1 and 3 are KXIP,2
RR is one of the few teams that could chase 220 on this ground,0
It seems $50 on rajasthan might not have been the best investment,33
What was that throw?,4
Ffs Rajpoot,3
"I see, Jos is continuing his wicket keeping form",6
wow this is going swimmingly!,3
FREE HIT,2
Honestly I'd love to see Tyagi play. Any bowler's gonna struggle in Sharjah but at least Tyagi has years ahead of him to learn. Not like military mediums like Rajpoot and Unadkat are gonna get any better,7
What is this Rajasthani Village Cricket show called?,3
This no ball siren is worse than whitehatjr ad,12
He's giving competition to Umesh...,6
How many have been till now? If it's less than 5 then 1st one,4
Rajpoot doing what he knows best,5
No ball as well fucking fabulous,9
R A J B O O T,6
Ankit rajpoot....the gift that keeps on giving.,8
Good job taking an extra step and bowling wide,6
"No ball and wide off the same delivery, dude..",10
Lol wide and a no ball,2
Buttler dropping everything today,2
Damn Rajpoot spraying harder than BLM protesters,4
"At this rate, Punjab could reach 250.",2
Sound of the police !,6
What the heck Rajput?,1
I'd kill to see punjab lift the cup this year if my sucky team well... Continues to be sucky,6
geez just five overs in and they‚Äôre sweating like balls,5
Wide+no ball+boundary in free hit,2
Ankit Rajpoot bowling a NO ball is useless. Every ball he bowls in practically a FREE HIT with his pace in Sharjah. üòÇ,7
KL and Mayank tellin them.how to powerplay.,1
A ball that shit when you bowled a no ball really should be given as both so that Rajpoot concedes the most runs possible.,1
"KXIP has to play like this, otherwise RR will just steamroll them.",1
Rcbians this 2 are your product don't forget,3
This is already looking like a 220+ match,3
"Rajpoot, Unadkat, Umesh and Siraj are trusted recruits of Dinda Academy ;) 

Yeah I am bringing fb shit here. Don't @me",6
I don't even know what's a good score on this pitch. CSK scored 200 and they weren't even trying,5
They dropped Jaiswal for Rajpoot on a small ass ground where you are chasing a big total,2
Imagine you're just chilling driving through Sharjah after work and all of a sudden you hear a loud ass siren and thinking you're gonna get nuclear blasted,16
Petition to include the term Butler fingers in dictionary,5
I feel sad for the bowlers,2
what is the highest powerplay score in this ipl?,2
"Jofra‚Äôs first over 

https://twitter.com/jofraarcher/status/486606978815651841?s=21",10
At least Rajpoot is bowling his wides and no-balls together rather than one after the other.,6
This is Cricket 07 level bowling,8
Rajboob out here widin‚Äô and no ballin‚Äô,1
200+ guaranteed,1
"Lol, wide and no ball at same time",1
Rajchut lmao,0
Rajpoot is getting paid 3 CRORE same as Unadkat,4
Umpire really hid his feelings well on that siren.,4
I'm so glad these 2 are playing so well. Looking forward to the Australia tour!,2
A bit early but KL is reminding me of 2016 Kohli,3
Umpire with that bowler hand marao signal there,1
okay archer maiden let‚Äôs go,7
"Why do people think that domestic Indian performance doesn't count in IPL ?

How many international/Indian national team bowlers does RR have ? Tom and Archer. Rest all are domestic Indian players only. 

Sarfaraz who had a wonderful season for Mumbai should be able to play RR's bowling well. He was absolutely smoking it in Ranji. He is an in form Indian player.",6
Not cool hotstar,4
Jofra needs to ball McGrath's line and length with Akhtar's pace,2
"Samson will fail today, heard it first here",12
Archer's slower one is the same speed as Unadkat/Ankit Rajpoot's faster ones.,17
I just wish Gayle would play today imagine him getting sixes even with edges and mis-timed shots. They could very well have gone past 300,4
"Yo KXIP robbed of a Run again? 

It was a Wide + No ball at 4.6",3
Should have dropped Robbie and kept Jaiswal :(,5
"umm rajasthan has only 4 proper batsmen: smith, butler, uthappa and samson. and idk if uthappa even qualifies as proper anymore.",5
Punjab middle order still not tested,2
Kxip is gonna have that one match where maxwell is gonna go completely baserk and im here for it.,4
Who's the Indian dude in Dugout,2
Shami is like WTF!?,25
Chad Shami vs Virgin Archer,8
[Jofra Archer said KL Rahul is the toughest batsman he has bowled so far in his T20 career.](https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket-jofra-archer-picks-kl-rahul-as-toughest-batsman-to-bowl-to-in-t20-cricket-615970),10
"Rahul creating another number 4 candidate for him to compete by making agarwal to open.

They both have to succeed dhawan rohit eventually.",13
Good to know that Abed is directing Cred ads,1
AgarWAR has decided to show that he can be as aggressive an opening batsman as anyone else.,2
WTF was that throw Smith,9
Shami is literally all of us whenever the wedding photographer comes around to click photos/take videos when we're eating,138
"Shami had a ""cameraman in your face when you eat at a wedding"" moment",86
I am with you Shami. I would hate to be videographed while eating.,22
"I can‚Äôt get mad at KL and Mayank so can they both get out so I can get mad at whoever‚Äôs batting next, thanks",11
2 runs of Jofra Archer on Sharjah pitch.,57
Great comeback by Jof,24
That was excellent man,11
Good comeback over from Archer,14
Only 2 runs :(,1
Finally a good fucking over,8
That shot of Shami has meme potential,67
Lol shami,6
Shami smirking at the screen like I came here to have some fruits and some doodh and I am almost done eating fruits,7
Was Shami reacting to the question on the screen?,14
"Bowled, Jof",9
"ground looks so small, they should give six runs if batsmen can run three here lol",5
Shami is worried now he's got give half of that too his ex,30
Nice comeback from Jof.,3
"Shami's like ""what! I earned it.""",9
Why do they have a separate seat in dugout now?,7
Oo it's spin time,6
Both these teams look good this IPL. I want them to make it to playoffs. Delhi too.,8
I'm getting a April May vibe just becuz of the ipl,4
Curran and Unadkat are going to score their respective 50's here aren't they?,2
"So all Karnataka here.. bowlers and batsman. 
GO Gopal GO",10
KPL nostalgia,2
Mix it like Betty Crocker,2
Are they going to score 250-300 today ?,3
[deleted],32
"KXIP are so dependent on their openers.

One day they‚Äôre gonna fail and the whole team is gonna fold for 50",2
I missed that shami shot...,1
Mayank should be a lock for limited overs for india. No questions.,1
Unadkat should have his GonadCut,6
Shreyas ‚ÄúBetty Crocker‚Äù Gopal.,7
Can anyone please help me get that Shami shot? Missed it,15
Betty Crocker the GOAT,3
"As MI fan, the meer sight of Jos Butler gives me shivers of fright. *gulp*",14
Has Uthappa officially changed his name to Robbie or what,10
Ooh insider info,2
kl is gonna come out of this ipl as an absolute legend. ooof.,14
Has any other bowler had so much scrutiny and expectation on them so early in their career as Jof?,36
Ashwin's and Rahul's jersey numbers add up to 1000,19
60/0 is KXIP's best powerplay score against Rajasthan Royals since 2018 by a large distance. They couldn't even go past 40 in the first six in the previous two years. Before today it was 39 runs in 2019.,6
At least that wasn't a boundary,9
That's caught in Dubai or Abu Dhabi,24
Maxwell would have caught that,7
Damn good stuff Riyan,14
Excellent fielding,11
Faf takes that catch for sure,4
Would've been out in any other ground lol,14
Faf would've caught that,14
"Nothing against parag

But why not smith in long on",4
"Saved 5 runs, great effort",6
"Wow. T20s are the one form of the game where 4 runs saved could win you the game!

Despite my preference for test matches, there is something to be said about the impact that the bare margins of the game have on the outcome of the shortest form. Just brilliant!

Edit - why the downvote?",7
Maxwell better score some runs or he is going to be the next Miller,3
He could have stood there and took the catch,1
My grandma would have caught that.,11
We need to get that Shami shot ASAP.,2
You guys think Kohli would be Jelly looking at KL's performance?,3
pollard would've caught that without even jumping,2
"Not gonna lie, Parag is good looking dude",5
"Damn.. these ‚ÄúJosh‚Äù are so fucking irritating!
Another cliche app like TikTok!",11
Riyan sounds like AMDs new graphic card.,15
"I know Sharjah is a small(er) ground. But, does anybody know the exact dimensions for today's match? Doesn't look like they are using the centre pitch.",2
"KXIP are a little light on their fast bowlers, otherwise the team looks quite balanced. Any good fast bowling all rounder would make their team balance one of the best in IPL",6
Yep they're right. Sanjay's a fraud.,5
Last match's partnership breaker! Go Tewatia!,2
"Agarwal is so classy, he can be an all Format player I think",7
Thanks Twatia,2
I'm calling it Tewatia makes a half century today,7
"Damn... If you look at players from the 80s 90s hitting 6s on this ground on youtube, you'd think the boundaries were 100m back then. And now you watch these fellows just chip it for a 6 and you realize that batriarchy is real.

Smash batriarchy!!",11
Yeah we‚Äôve lost this one,3
Make Mayank and Rahul open for India,5
So do I watch this slaughter till last or no? üò≠,5
Shot!,2
Agarwal is getting his 100 today,8
My god that was a sexy six,2
Mayank on fire.,5
Oh man mayank you beauty,3
TWAT,1
Chawla vibes,3
Sharjah is a poor man's Chinnaswamy. Change my mind.,16
"Wowza, what a shot",2
Sharjah is kill for bowlers,6
RIP spinners,2
This is pure class,3
was sharjah this big when desert storm happened?,5
Property cunting,2
"Awesome batting !!

RR under the pump",3
Yeah fuck this Tewatia guy,4
Agarwal wants that orange cap from KL,6
Gayle has no chance now,3
"Tewatia, I hope you don't get wicket. But if you do, please do not do that ""celebration"" , where you put your index fingers of both hands in your ears.

I don't ""get"" it.",7
"I am loving seeing Twatia get hammered

He's going to waste a review soon",9
Mayank has been so smooth today.,9
Daddy Mayank,7
We are rekt üòë,5
Boy oh boy he is a test opener...,7
Sharjah was always known as the graveyard of bowlers.,6
I just hope Punjab ain't showing their best performance only in the first half of the tournament,5
Yeah Tewatia talk now nah!,6
Tewatia rn : üëâüòîüëà,17
mayank yanking it around.,3
Tehwaashia/Tehwaatiya/Tehwayshia?,3
Can't wait for Jos to get 2(3) on this somehow,12
"Right then, Rajasthan getting a taste of their own medicine.",5
No no no man wtf are these idiots doing we can't lose,6
Techutiya,10
Joss is mad.,3
WTF is this bowling? Damn! Its so disheartening to see bowlers being fucked this way!,3
Tewatia puts in a lot of effort for zero spin,5
When's the last time Smith got a chance to bowl?,5
"Between Mayank Agarwal and KL Rahul, Mayank Agarwal is the aggressive one üò±",2
"Kamal Hasan after the over: Tewatia, Tewatia , Tewatia oh ho ....",5
RT has the ugliest action in IPL,9
Tendulkar had posters of Mayank Agarwal on his bedroom wall growing up.,49
le Buttler :- how the fuck,10
Need to get hold of a postcard sized photo of Tewatia and shred it tbh,5
ok RR is fucked,6
" Not gonna lie, since mayank has mainly played tests for us I didn‚Äôt expect him to crush it like this",7
Russell should bat at No.3 on this Ground.,13
Welp. We dead.,8
"Ok, so important question for all KXIP fans.

Canada or UAE ?",4
I wish a shot could just be appreciated for what it is instead of being sponsored by a tyre/cement/mobile phone company,70
Playing two spinners on this ground is suicide,4
Tewatia will do that celebration again but this time towards smith.,12
[removed],20
I want to see twatia get smacked for all his shitty celebrations,46
KXIP is the RCB we were promised!,39
Timeouts are shit,6
Press F for RCB who are playing KKR on this 30 yard field,143
This fucking timeout kills momentum,12
"I was watching Deano's batting in a video uploaded by Cricket Australia's YouTube channel and one 6 that he hit was so huge, and now compare it to this ground. Doesn't matters, it's fun watching so many sixes. Batriarchy FTW.",7
I want all games in Sharjah,11
Is RR supposed to be worse than RCB?,2
I bet this ground will produce 500 runs in a match (both team totals combined),5
Tewatia getting cunted... good stuff.,12
what do you even say as a captain when all of your bowling options are getting mauled?,3
was sharjah bigger during sandstorm or was it just the cameras?,6
Is Mark Nicholas still around or did they fire him/did he quit after Sivaramakrishnan got mad at him for comparing Jadhav to Tendulkar?,-1
Mayank is absolutely smacking them short ones.,3
Wanna bet Kohli will still pick Dhawan as his first-choice opener for T20Is in Aus despite all this carnage from Agarwal and Rahul,27
Maxwell Miller 2014 ü§ù KL Mayank 2020,29
Mayank is making a pretty strong case for his spot in Indian white ball team in this IPL,6
We are dead only Buttler can save us now,2
why is such a big kid learning about circles in that byju‚Äôs ad,7
Wicket after time-out ?,2
Mayank has never really done justice to his talent in IPL. Hope we finally get a great season out of him.,10
"Lol why tf are people so insistent on saying games lost for RR, calm your tits we're 8 overs in and we've got the universe jos to come in to bat on a road",7
"Speaking of big sixes, do you guys remember Justin Kemp?",3
Desperately need wickers here. Chases have been really tough this year,2
Sharjah should have a bowling friendly pitch. It would be a crazy contest between bat & ball,1
How much of RR's Championship win in 2008 was down to Warne's captaincy? They have been a meh franchise ever since,3
TWATia,3
"Tewatia might as well cover his asshole, cause he is getting fucked.",5
It's crazy that Mayank averages just 20. I recently made a post involving stats from all sorts of obscure players and Mayank flew right under my radar.,2
Is the pitch super flat or what?,2
"Something seems to have clicked for Mayank this year in the IPL, maybe the opening slot and the backing of Kannadigas Bois leading the side has put him at ease, because he would've got out after making an aggresive and pretty 20-30 in other seasons, but his shot selection seems to have improved.",6
why did smith decide to bowl first? i don't get it.,1
Josh Buttler licking his lips,4
This hurts,6
"All lime light on Rahul

But what a fantastic season has it been for Mayank

Had he finished that game against dc, he wud have been above Rahul for this season till now atleast for me.",8
Really missing live audience here!,9
Smith should have opted bat first,5
Prayer circle for Smith and Buttler to radiate BDE in the next innings please,3
Aggarwal and Rahul competing for that orange cap lol,11
prediction for Jos? picked him for my fantasy today!,9
Oh carnage,1
Bahutule can use those ears to fly.,3
"Bowlers: exist

Sharjah: We will end your careers",11
Which PornHub category would this be in,12
I'll be right back I just wanna wank to the idea of KL and Mayank playing for RCB.,10
We needed this boundary assault to recover from the boredom of last two games. Thanks ~~M. Chinnaswamy Stadium~~ Sharjah,3
I hope RR wins,2
Mayank that is a fantastic knock,7
Bring on Smith to bowl,7
This is Sanju Samson all over again,3
"Come on Kings XI, show your inner RCB",5
Tom Curran won't be able to bowl 4 overs at death. Get him in next,8
Wow that Hosh Josh ad is hot lol,5
Mayank going bonkers,5
"Mayank is so good against spin, especially the way he handled the GOAT Lyon in Australia",5
"Identify 4 over bowlers - Archer, Curran, Gopal

Other 8 overs among 3 bowlers - Tewatia, Rajput, Unadkat",1
Batting masterclass by these two.,2
I don't have access to Hindi commentary but has any commentator made the 'Than Than Gopal' joke yet?,2
So did KXIP miss a trick not playing Gayle here in place of Maxwell?,3
"Fuck it, bowl Buttler",5
with those ears if he can't hear you then there is something seriously wrong,5
"If ground is this small, atleast should keep something for the bowlers in the pitch smh",4
*UNIVERSE BOSS APPROVES*,6
"Maya with that 200+ strike rate!!!


Karnataka XI have top 2 in that highest run scorer list!!!",5
Been a while since I've e seen Bahuthule,2
RR gonna win this one easily,4
"If Mayank scores 100 ,  warne wud want him as well in indian t20 side",3
Damn,1
Imagine SRH openers playing on this ground.,2
Not sure if this is Agarwal or Gayle,6
I want these dudes to bat 20 overs both.,4
This ground is fucking disgrace. Hitting balls for sixes seems like child play,5
"What the fuck, Mayank!",5
I know the ground‚Äôs small but their shots are going well beyond the ropes,6
This is ridiculous from Mayank.,1
I think Sairaj bahutule was just pretending that he could not to hear the commentator's so that he does not have to answer questions about RR's bowling ü§£üòÇü§£,6
230+ is definitely on the cards. This is absolutely murdering the RR's confidence,4
It's a war for AgarWar.,1
Cmon smith have a bowl would you?,2
Gayle's D has a bigger diameter than this ground.,8
That's gayle's ipl carrer done right there.,7
Feel like pure shit. Want a collapse now,2
RR's bowling is pretty bad ngl .,3
"Kudos to KXIP for sticking with their decision of not selecting Gayle. These two have amazing chemistry as opening pair, playing for Karnataka as well.",14
What you guys think? 250 on the table?,5
Mayank has such disdain against spinners.,5
Mayank showing a disdain to leg spinners like Sehwag had for off spinners,6
[deleted],7
"Petition to never play any form of competitive cricket at Sharjah ever, these dogshit boundary lengths just make it a batsman's game and nothing else",10
Good to KL  taking a backseat and giving  the strike to Mayank because he is in all rage,7
I am enjoying KXIP batting immensely but one has to wonder what would Gayle do at this postage ground,9
Agarwal trying to outhit Rahul's 132.,10
Rahul will marmalize Curran in the death overs unless they get him out now.,10
This is going to be a blood bath.,7
"KXIP: RCB rehab program

change my mind",11
"No turn, no bounce, no seam, short boundaries, excessive dew. At this point, matches in Sharjah seems to be a big joke.",11
"26-ball 50 from India's Test opener. Mayank Agarwal showing his versatility in his batting. Also, smart approach from KXIP with Mayank going hard and KL Rahul keen to bat through.",6
Google says Tewatia = goddess. Mistranslation? Please educate.,2
Easy 250.,2
Did we have such high scores even in 2014?,1
Why hasn't Tom Curran bowled a single over yet?,1
"Rahul is  34(25) but Mayank‚Äôs 63(29) making him look slow as fuck, this is next level stuff from Mayank",2
"Apart from Mayank & KL, rest of the KXIP batsmen aren't in much form.",5
That csk run chase is going to be questioned even more as the tournament goes on. What were they doing on this ground.,5
The duality of Jofra Archer in his two overs. When they're going at 12.5/over sending 6 balls down for 2 runs is really impressive.,3
So plan is Mayank plunder while KL plays the proverbial anchor role?,5
Is that aamir khan without botox?,3
When will Kohli play like this ?,2
Rcb boys doing well for KXIP in consecutive games,6
Karnataka opening is fucking amazing man,8
Buttler is going to make 150 in 30 balls here. Gayle could do it in 25.,9
Damn that dummy is gonna give me nightmares,7
Unleash the quiche at 3,3
they're completely ignoring my boii badri at the dugout :(,1
Has a batting first team ever finished without losing any wickets in IPL?,4
Welcome back to da club RR,5
My two favourite batsmen just hammering bowlers left right and centre. I'm so happy Cricket and more specifically IPL is back.,2
I low-key like this batting friendly ground and six fest after witnessing slow chases for entire week,2
After 3-4 dead matches today everyone wildin,4
Is Pepto Besmol a popular brand in India?,1
[deleted],7
Tommy the machine gun is here,1
Good luck Tom Curran for the fifty ü§û,2
I want all KXIP games to be in Sharjah,3
shit streaming from yupptv,1
Why the slow run rate?,2
Ooo bit of TC,1
Mayank wouldn't let Nathan Lyon settle in Tests,2
"If RR wins this, I will shave my pubes and use it as a stache! EDIT : looks like my timmer will be busy tonight.",44
Swanny is a treat to listen to,3
"As a Delhi fan , this ground makes me happy.",2
We are winning this.,2
Playing at Sharjah must feel like heaven on earth for batsman after playing at the long boundaries in Abu Dhabi and Dubai,1
These 2 are going to eat Tom Curran for breakfast,3
Why are Tyagi and Jaiswal not picked?,3
Can't wait for buttler to absolutely smash everything to the stands.,5
Seeing a batsman charging down the ground against a leg spinner in Sharjah and hitting a six makes me nostalgic,8
Tommy gun!,3
"Unpopular opinion: India would've been much more successful in all formats if they didn't mix t20, odi and test selections over last 8 odd years",10
220+ looking good here. Looking forward for Butler and Samson,4
Should KL also be going from his end now?,3
Dinda Academy bowler from South Africa is here.,3
When Mayank was selected as replacement for vijay Shankar I was thinking why ..at that time I had a perspective of him being just a test player,7
I can't unsee those ears. They are like mutts.,16
"Mayank bro, katti(friendship over with Mayank bro)",4
Can they really call it a maximum on this ground? Probably only if Glenn is batting,2
Curran's celebrappeal?,2
"Just release Gayle ,Kanos if you're not gonna play them ffs",4
"This is such a wonderful batting partnership. Quite often both the settled batsman try to the play the anchor role and end up digging a hole for the team. Remember RCB's 1st match ?

One of the set opener has to fire and Agarwal is doing it beautifully. Both Rahul and Agarwal seems to know their role quite clearly. 

Wonderful execution by KXIP.",5
He looks like a rat who metamorphed into a human,2
250 loading,2
I can‚Äôt support RR for picking Uthappa again over Yashshvi Jaisval. Makes me so angry!!,9
"
**KL Rahul-M Agarwal**

- Highest powerplay score of the season 

- First century opening partnership of the season",3
the only way rr to win the trophy is yo bowl in abu dhabi and bat in sharjah,3
Why would anyone even want to be a bowler,3
Everyone out here learning to code,2
Did Tom just say ‚Äúhow the fuck did they get four‚Äù LMAOOOO,8
The boundary behind the keeper is so short you can see it in frame when the bowlers start their run-up.,3
Mayank is cunting it,3
"This Royals bowling is total shit. Or Agarwal is making it look that way, idk. But, wonder wtf CSK were upto earlier in the week",1
Remember this is Sharjah so anything above 200 is par I guess,3
Agarwal batting like prime Gayle,4
Agarwal doing a sehwag,3
My brother scored 16 runs off Sairaj Bahutule's over when he visited his college in 2007,4
"Downvoter is here, boys and girls",8

Mayank going sicko modee,1
Parag is a good fielder apparently,3
"Dude's really gone off

Idk who pissed him off but he seems on a mission lmao",7
Mayank here giving no chance to universe boss.,4
250 on the cards?,3
"Save us lord Curran , bring back that Curran from odi against Aussies",11
Who's this guy?,1
"I'm surprised that Sairaj Bahutule wasn't able to hear them the first time around, given the size of his ears.",12
Mayank at 1.8 crores was such a steal,114
"Agarwal has forced the spinners out of the attack.

It was spinners who took wickets for RR against CSK.",9
Not following the match rn. Who‚Äôs wearing the orange cap and are they exchanging it as one goes past the other? That‚Äôd be hilarious,3
Holy shit. it's sairaj 'the sidekick man's anil kumble' bahutule.,6
15 run short.        /S,3
"180 would be a dream. 220 minimum I'd say with pooran, Maxwell still left.",1
It's nice to see that my U12s ground would be big enough to host IPL matches.,3
no way rr is restricting them to 180.,3
Mayank killing it in IPL is giving me fears for Aus Tests. KLPD PTSD.,3
180 lol,2
"Mayank to Gayle : *look at me, I'm the Boss now*",5
8 run over at this stage is considered economical :),4
" Rajasthan's manager is fucking high. The lads like, we should keep them down to 180.",2
Hopefully we restrict them below 190,3
Good over in the context of this innings so far,3
"Agarwal on 69\*

Best time to get him out, come on bois",6
230 minimum,1
Even CSK scored 200,7
With 10 overs & 10 wickets left KXIP should aim for 225-250 score.,2
why kl playing so slow,3
"Rr doing a kkr by playing an extra bowler

But not doing what they did right onfield that is opening with premiere bowler

Who tf opens with unadkat n rajpoot when u have Jofra",1
Even 230 can be chased easily on this ground tbh,2
I was alive when Shikhar Dhawan was the brand ambassador for ETFs,1

We want 250 pleaseeee,1
KX must have been inspired by the damage that Ganju exacted on CSK .,1
Yusuf Pathan with his sword,1
"Me: This whole win the toss and bowl thing isnt working

IPL captains: no, no next time it'll definitely work",9
267 final score,1
Jadeja would be disappointed in that sword dude,8
Don't think they're bowling the spinners again. Going to be all slower balls from here.,2
Unadkat taking one here would be peak meltdown for this sub.,9
is that Yusuf Pathan with the sword,6
Warne : Macgill :: Kumble : Bahutule,6
Even mishits are going for 4's,3
That's just cruel,2
uthappa giving away more runs with misfields than he'll make in this match.,10
Is 250 on the cards? Seems like it,4
Ok this pitch is a bit ridiculous,5
"yeah, nah nothing champion about them",2
"Opposition striking at 11 rpo and you have to bring in unadkat.

  


Poor Smith",7
Lol the edge is the most productive shot in cricket,4
Mistimed shots for boundary. RIP bowlers,6
Please get to 240. I know Buttler will chase it down anyways.,5
Just how big this mutual funds is ? seems to have employed every Indian IPL players just for its ads,3
"Both KL and Mayank are at the prime age for a batsman (Prime age for batsman supposed to be 27/28 - 32).

If Indian can shed the conservative approach and get away from super star culture, the we can maximise the returns from these guys opening in ODIs till 2023.

KL, Mayank (Shaw/Gill as backup) for opening.

Move Rohit down to 3 and Kohli moves himself down to 4 (which he was already trying on occasions to fit in KL in the last year).

This will solve the No. 4 and middle order issues with Kohli holding the innings in the middle part of the game and helping the lower order explode (Pant, Pandya, Jadeja).

Thank Dhawan for his services so far but his time is up. He is struggling with long breaks and no active game time between ODI bilaterals. It's common for aging batsman who do not play all formats of the game to be out of practice.",7
Everything turning gold for Mayank atm,2
Everybody except RR loves Unadkat,5
Mayank to score a 100 today,1
"Bruh why doesn't Mayank just get out?üòìüòì
Hitting boundaries of edges",3
On a scale of 1 to intolerable how cringy are the clips of those people making weird gestures with no sound on,11
What a joke of a ground and pitch this is though,1
Mayank trying to get out,1
"That dude with sword, bro they slashing us already keep that shit back.",2
Those fanboard is poor man's tiktok,6
Chances Smudger decides to show the spinner how it is done?,1
"and as a csk fan, this ground makes me uncomfortable",5
"If I didn't know and had to guess which one of these two scored a 132 in the last game, I wouldn't be picking Rahul.",7
Too many of Mayank's mishits have gone to the fence.,5
"mayank 100, kl 150 loading.",1
Everything landing in no man's land!,2
"KL should just start swinging at every ball from now on, still lots of firepower remaining in the back",4
RR should open with Jofra. lad would smack 4 sixes per over,8
"I want to see Mayank making 120+ so that RCB is not in that list, for at least one entry",7
Par score is 250 here,6
Can i switch sides now,3
Whose the madlad with the sword,1
Agarwal is on 74! How tf is he scoring so quick?,4
Used to like Mayank before today. Now I fucking despise him.,3
Tom Curran at 9.3 over: Ah Fck I don't wanna bowl.,3
What Kings XI are doing is scoring quickly which is not what Rajasthan Royals want. Rajasthan will need to score more runs than Kings XI if they want to win,-1
Nice to see RCB lite doing well...much better than RCB.,5
Mayank swinging at everything now. Not the worst idea with what they have in the shed still. Can't really afford less than 10 an over even at this point.,3
Jos the boss can chase down 200 in this stadium on his own on his good day.,11
Seems like Kl will break Kohlis record of 973 runs in a season this year.,1
The dream 11 fanboard is far cringeier than boomer uncles dancing on tik tok.,5
"Someone remind Uthappa aaj sirf gand nahi dikhani hai, khelna bhi hai.",5
[The guy with the sword may chop his bits off](https://i.imgur.com/TRVNd8O.jpg) if he isn't careful,1
RR opted to bowl after winning the toss!,3
"I don't think you can ever say ""Today's just not Unadcut's day""",3
This ground is just goddamn ridiculous!!!!!!!!,2
Lmao RR actually thought they were good after last match,6
"When are MI gonna play in Sharjah? With QdK, Rohit Pollard and Hardik they are gonna get 250 lol",7
Say what you will but jaydev walking back to his run-up is quite a sight lol,3
"All those saying CSK scored 200 easily are overlooking scoreboard pressure while chasing, 230 isn‚Äôt going to be easy at all. Scoring 10-15 pro while batting first vs when it is necessarily required while chasing - 2 different things",6
Shami steaming in will make the score look even bigger. Tough day to be a RR fan. fml,7
Maxi at #3 and Pooran at #4 i suppose,5
I think Rajasthan Royals need some wickets here,11
C'mon KL don't eat up too many balls. You got plenty of batters in the shed.,-3
Kl playing tuk tuk.. why?,-5
Unadkat wow you never fail to impress me with your idiocy,3
Unadkat in depression,2
What an opening from these too best in whole of ipl teams this season. just WOW,2
I have seen so many players who were memed into form by r/cricket. Except for this fucking cunt.,8
[deleted],7
"Dugout has become such a narcissistic cesspool. ""Oh yes get me a wicket. Here's the wicket! Oh here's the wicket!"" The big over/ wicket alert is just fucking awful, they spend the whole over just talking like bookies and gamblers, and the next they spend talking about how they could have gotten it right, and then just stupid banter. Watching without audio now.",3
"120 and 9 overs to go 



Hmmmmmm.",1
Unadkat‚Äôs body language seems to be questioning his existence,5
Unadkaat daala reh baba,2
I think every team needs a Kiwi to tell them what to do in this ground,3
RR opted to bowl after winning the toss. Clown team,4
Where I thought this is the over where unadkat won't give 10 he surprises with a wide,2
look at that teacher's pet sitting in between the two coaches,1
[deleted],-1
"Agarwal piled on runs in domestic and was finally given a chance after Dhawan,Vijay and Rahul became so shit that it wasn't feasible to select them anymore. He grabbed the opportunity with both hands and didn't throw away his shot",5
"Time for Rahul to have a swing. 10 wickets in hand, 2 set batsmen, they should both try to go absolutely crazy at this stage.",2
"Given the number of wickets left, Rahul should be taking more risks.",0
I think an all Karnataka XI can beat Bangladesh,11
Where the hell are Rajasthan Royals' fielders?,3
Rahuls strategy is basically not give wickets away. Slog if the other batsman is hitting. Pretty good plan and very unselfish from him,5
Time for Schrodinger orange cap,3
How to mute this fucking takatak ad its killing my soul.,2
"KL 38, Mayank 76 i really wanted that reversed. Fantasy busted.",8
I wonder what happened to Reetinder Singh Sodhi,5
Cunted,3
Rahul playing a good innings by keeping the other end safe while agarwal smashes.,11
that was a slap more than a shot,8
KL decided he wants another 100,6
KL Rahul tuk tuk what now?,2
Why are they sharing a towel?,3
This ground is just mental harrasment with bowlers,10
Dispatched,1
"As an RCB fan, I don‚Äôt feel so bad about the last match any longer",6
What happened to Paul Valthati?,4
"Guys I don't mind Sanjay Bangar's commentary

Unpopular opinion probably",4
Its amusing cause RR chose to be on the receiving end of this,7
"Is it okay to question Steve Smith‚Äôs captaincy? Or is it automatic downvote? 

For one, that toss decision was a brain fart.",25
Wow! Great partnership so far,5
I'm interested in how Smith will go on about this given the size of the ground,4
[deleted],8
I wanna see 2 centuries scored,11
Both are gonna score hundreds,5
Coonted,7
"RR lineup

4. Parag

5. Uthappa

6. Curran

How has Tom gotten away with that full toss?,2
These Altroz plugs are fucking great,7
"Dugout bois are getting it wrong today , have predicted wickets 5 times lol",6
Punjab feasting on tom curry,9
What a shot from Rahul,6
Was that a fuckin golf shot man wtf,7
Unadkat's bowling reminds me of 'Abhi to humein aur zaleel hona hai' (T: I am not done getting insulted) from a movie starring Kangana,5
That was darn good,7
Cmon that's cheating. How can you do that?,3
Is this Hong Kong sixes match going on,10
Mayank looks like a cat about to catch it's prey I fucking swear he ready to get 150 today.,5
KXIP on üî•,2

OHH RAHUL I CAME,7
KL is undoubtedly one of the best LOI players of this generation.,2
That grip üçΩÔ∏èü§§,1
WTF. Was that.,1
I for one am marking down on the calendar all the Sharjah games. Worth a watch.,4
"Only 1 team has won the game in this ipl after winning toss that is the opening game

The best t20 league in the world having matches decided at toss lol",1
"Don't understand Royal's decision to chase, surely on a pitch this small with the batting line up that they've got it'd be better to bat first and do what Kings are doing, just settle down and smash out a 200+",3
The down voter must be a KL fan girl.,8
"Man I love Mayank, but KL is just so awesome to watch. The way he effortlessly hits the ball to the boundary is beautiful.",6
What's is highest first wicket partnership??? Between gilly and marsh,4
Now KL is toying around!!,5
Can't believe this meme ground produced legendary ODI matches,10
bro he just tapped the ball and it flew to the boundary. what is this ground even?!,15
Swann wants a wicket so bad,7
Batting paradise,11
Someone whisper sweet nothings into my ear please.,10

"Long shot but I would be so so happy if Punjab wins the season. The way they've been playing for this match, and the last, they deserve to be the contenders for the Cup.",12
RR will probably lose this by a big margin,6

"Absolute class, now Slog.",6
Fucking ban this ground already,14
"I understand the crowd noise is being pumped in, but it's really grating today. Did they turn up the volume or something? Fucking hate this.",5
Playing an anchor still 50(35),9
KL 100% getting the orange cap this year. His purple patch is still going strong.,8
Unpopular opinion: this match is as boring as the low scoring ones as the bowlers have literally nothing for themselves here. Might as well bring bowling machines here.,0
Still can't believe how Tom Curran can get an IPL bid and Mark Wood can't who always plays ahead of Tom for England.,10
This ground is smaller than the grounds at New Zealand.,4
Tom has given up,1
I swear if Mayank gets out before his well deserved 100..,5
man this aakash chopra guy is so irritating,4
Revenge of the kings,2
Maxi should come in next,8
Mayank time for century today,5

We'll have a bowl first lmao,6

Rahul India's best batsman rn?,9
"When u have a team that can‚Äôt find place for the universe boss, you know that is special",2
KL Rahul holds his bat like its a fucking toothpick,4
Feels like Tom Curran is going to cry at any moment now,5
Surely it's a collective decision by the team whether they want to bat or ball first. Why are fans blaming Smith?,4
KL is an absolute master.,2
Records made on this ground shouldn't be counted,6
KL Rahul becomes first batsman to complete 200 runs in IPL 2020¬†at an average of 202.,10
This is like getting a star on super mario,8

"I feel like if ICC doesn't add some rules to help bowlers, no will want to become one.",3
"1, 4 and 6 are the only possibilities right now.",5
"With Curran getting smacked, you can‚Äôt really fault Unadkat here",7
"Tom Curran looks like he‚Äôs gonna cry, someone pls give him a hug",6
Imagine how Smith would feel about his decision to bowl if both of these guys play out the 20 overs?,3
Its surprising and annoying how the sponsors send the worst car in their lineup for advertisement.,5
I can't bat like this even when playing book cricket.,5
138 after 12 overs looks like a comedy score,7
Congrats KXIP party hard tonight,5
"watching Tom Curran getting hit for boundaries is amusing, he over-reacts like a Bollywood Actor",4
Why did rr even choose to bowl. Didn't they see the last few matches. They were in one.,3
These guys are hitting boundaries at will,5
KL has to stay till the end. Maxi and Pooran are too mercurial,4
Atleast 230 with this rate,4
These grounds are like death sentence for bowlers .,5
Man people be jinxing joss today. He will go on a duck.,8

"**16.3** Curran to Agarwal, OUT, follows him as he attempts a yokrer. He ends up bowling a low full toss but he has successfully managed to cramp Agarwal, taking his arms away from him. Agarwal still attempts a six, but ends up holing out to deep midwicket **183-1**

Wow. How did that not hit stumps,1
"I'm really inspired by Mayank Agarwal's performances. Guy has been around for so many seasons, but was underrated, and could never really make his mark in the tournament. Must have been really frustrating- to miss out on opportunities season after season. But he never gave up, and kept performing wonders in domestic. He's now one of the most promising upcoming players in the national team, and also making a great name for himself here at the IPL. Life is about never giving up, and Mayank has made me learn that. Keep playing like the champ you are, man!",14

OK i love KL Rahul but I sorta don't want him to get a hundred here.. Him getting a hundred would kinda end up overshadowing Mayank here... And Mayank deserves all the attention esp after the huge volume of runs he's scored in domestic cricket in India.. Unfortunately ipl performances are second only to international performances in India.. So hope he gets the appropriate attention for this brilliant knock,1
Come on KL. I was promised 250.,4
Maxi swinging blindly,3
New trick for Sharjah. Don't let openers get out till end and they will get tired and runs will slow in death overs.,4
if any captain chooses not to bat first on this ground they‚Äôre high out of their mind,12

Finally the fake crowd noise feels organic,8
What a brilliant shot!,7
That's a Maxi special lmao.,6
Even NZ grounds are bigger than this,7
Go on Maxi,9
To all those saying they're doing this just because of the ground being tiny. You still have to have the execution to do it and that too in an opening partnership. Mayank and KL absolutely wreaked havoc.,10
Maxwell doing it finally,5
Why the hell is everyone getting downvoted?,8
What a shot Maxi,10
Who got out and how much did he make,9

ended with SR < 130. Actually turned out to be kind of a poor knock.,2

Not often that 69(54) isn't a good knock but a tad slow here - ofc he did give Mayank good support so maybe I'm being harsh,5
9 overs for 69 is not great on this pitch. KL got too conservative and couldn't compensate.,7
No quiche today either.,-3

Who downvoting? I get upvote,8
As I've been saying for the last 5 overs now KL Rahul has been unnecessarily slow. After 110/0 in 10 overs you should aim for 250 with 10 wickets in hand at Sharjah. They've gone for 85 off the past 8.2 overs which isnt actually bad,10

Maxwell looking in great touch today for a player of his caliber,1
Don‚Äôt replay that shit I‚Äôm gonna throw up,5
The umpire looks like the kind of bloke who would stare at me and mumble something because I am wearing a Metallica t shirt with skulls on it.,9

Archer is shit bowler lmao,4
Don't give four 6s Archer,2
Do they search for the lost balls or just let it go?,4

Same score that RR made against CSK?,4
"Your team's club legend

CSK - Mahendra Singh Dhoni ( One of the greatest captain of all time, has carried his team so many times, his wicketkeeping skills are insane)

MI - Malinga ( The greatest T20 bowler. Bowlers feared him, on his day, he could get any wicket he wants) 

RCB- Virat kohli ( if we keep the banter aside, he's already a legend at such a young age, he is a class apart, he was there when he was nothing, now he's still there after everything)

DC- Amit mishra ( Always performed when he played, the most consistent spinner in the league, always gets the job done) 

SRH - David Warner (a batsmen who could challenge virat kohli in his peak, it's him, man puts it out of the park making the bowler look like a child)

KXIP- Piyush Chawla ( although not considered good, his consistency for this team was amazing)

RR- Shane Watson (A great all rounder, man has centuries and could take some amazing wickets, a perfect all rounder)

KKR- Gautam Gambhir ( Fucking hated this guy so much, he just used to stay at the crease and play, and didn't even give any chance to other bowlers)

Any other opinion is welcome, this is just a random list I made because I was bored.",17
Anyone doubting pooran should look at his odi stats.,9
"""We'll have a bowl, thanks""",9
Lmao both the top strikers are bowlers,6
The beauty of this score is there is no 30 run overs. That shows no bowler was spared,11
"Doesn't the line move with the batsman ? 

So if a batsman moves to leg side..does the off side wide line move with him closer to the stumps ?

If not, then bowlers shouldn't cry about leg side wide line not moving with the batsman.

Rules are quite clear about it.",-2

Get Butler and Samson out and Game is over.,5
Nicky P can gain some confidence off this and build,2
So this ground is this year's Chinnaswamy?,10
No way Royal Rumble is chasing this down. The problem with chasing 223 is the pressure of chasing the big score and also KX bowlers must have figured which lengths to bowl and what pace. But i hope we gonna get an exciting chase.,6
It's chaseable. Would need to bat well but it's certainly not improbable.,4

"I have trouble understanding the wide rule. 

 Does the off side wide line move with the batsman ? Then it should move both ways. When batsman moves to off side..it goes beyond the marking on the pitch. So if the batsman moves towards leg side, it should move closer to the stumps.


The wide line is marked according to the position of the stumps, not the stance of batsman. It's not just about whether batsman could reach it.

So if a batsman stands outside the pitch on off-side..where would the wide line go ? Is the bowler bowling to take wickets or giving throw downs ?

Stumps don't move with the batsman.


This whole movement of line is very much like elusive ""spirit of the cricket"".",10

And that's game over y'all. G'night.,6
jos does not look in goof knick at all. welp.,3
"That gentleman is **Game, set and match**.",2
Fuck off Scott Styrus and your fucking Dugout ... I‚Äôm trying to watch the match here,1
Sharp catch!!,3
That innings was a bit all over the place. Hopefully Samson can pick up the pace here,5
Nothing makes me less happy than Cottrell‚Äôs celebration.,2
Ffs jos,7
Just do it fucking collapse already for my sanity,10
"As expected, Buttler fails.",8
There goes the chase,8
"cottrell bowls like a freight train with a crazy action but is not that fast lol.

&#x200B;

and now he just got a wicket",12
holy shittt. that's the game.,4
"Oh boy, Samson it's gonna be your time today",3
"Rip

RR need a Samson special

Shame he used it last match lol",9
"**2.2** Cottrell to Buttler, OUT, the Cottrell salute comes out **19-1**

JC Buttler c Khan b Cottrell 4 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14",5
"KLPD not wearing a helmet, jus so he can flex on that orange Cap  üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è",7
That celebration is the fucking best.,14
All that hype for Buttler to get 4 from 7.,13
bruh üòî,2
Great catch from Panda,9
"Oh fuck that might be the game, also Cottrell is the single most annoying human on the planet",10
A salute it is.,6
"My day is ruined, congratulations, you sad little men.

Pathetic",13
Had to be that saluting cunt as well....,11
One of these days they're gonna have to bring in someone to finish Cotrell's over because he injured himself after a wicket,6
Cottrell winning the salute battle.,5
"Shud i sleep now?? 

Or samson gonna surprise with back to back good knocks",6
We were never going to win anyway after that opening stand.,6
Uthappa will chase this down. He did it last season for KKR,7
"/r/cricket: Jos, talk nah!",6
Hope they get less than 109,6
Everytime samson hits a boundary please spam DAMN SON,4
Everything depends on these two,5
Samson uhhh can we get some sixes on the menu please,3
Guy who does laal salaam bowling to guy who does laal salaam,2
Thicc boi sarfaraz is just in the team for fielding lol,4
Sarfaraz taking diving catches! Someone's gotten much fitter.,3
High hopes from Samson & Riyan Parag,1
"Cotrell , you beauty",3
That angry stare lol,2
"Okay Samson, get in first

Edit : or that. GET IN!",2
"RR don't loose one more here ,we need one good chse  this season",2
Lollll it's the Cottrell vs Buttler match up again,3
booooooring. another dead rubber chase.,0
Okay Cottrell‚Äôs salute is fun to watch ngl,9
"[Hauntingly, sickeningly accurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j0q0o6/match_thread_9th_match_rajasthan_royals_v_kings/g6utc95?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",8
These wide calls are so inaccurate. In the previous innings too,6
Why is KL getting fuckin excited every time the ball touch his hands,3
Samson my captain,5
Samson,3
Damn Son,5
"No Sanju, don't give me hope",4
There is **one** imposter amongst us,3
OMG best shot of the match,2
Sheldon should do his salute celebration only after a 5 for. Doing it after every wicket is so stupid . It‚Äôs like jaddu doing the sword celebration after every boundary .,4
Get in there Sanju boi.,1
Remember when England beat the shit out of Windies and Buttler mock saluted after slamming Cottrell for a six?,7
First ball six... He will probably get out this over,3
"I dunno man, you‚Äôre 3. That celebration is bit much, no?",0
Last batting pair for RR,4
"I‚Äôm in the minority that doesn‚Äôt like the Cottrell celebration, like, ever",10
"Based on history, I'm expecting Sanju to hole out to long on for under 10 today.",11
Why dont they show six distance now,6
"Ganju is like I dont care, bring it bitches!",6
LMAO Sanju,10
"Samson is here, guys! This match is alive.",9
Salaam saab op,3
Samson u beauty,4
What a shot!,2
Samson at it again!!!!,4
think they'll get to 150?,3
"Okay, I guess I'll stick around longer Sanju.",5
"Samson can't play two good knocks in a row, right?",14
Remember having talent like Samson and Mayank and still playing Jadhav and Dhoni in a WC semi-final.,17
DAMN SON,4
KXIP is one wicket away from a win,5
"Alright, time for the Samson show",7
Gg wp. Gn folks!,3
Golf swing,3
How many time have we seen Samson getting of the mark with a 6,9
Samson doesn't give a fuck,12
Damn Son,3
Samson my man,5
"this is problem with Samson he will try to a hit a 6 off the first ball

even Afridi wouldn't do that",6
"Without Buttler it's nearly impossible to chase this imo. Smith won't be able to accelerate a lot, all hope on Samson.",6
big dick six samson,6
Ffs,2
Yeah that‚Äôs good Sanju don‚Äôt let the pressure get to you,7
Perfect SR already,3
Time for the SanjuStorm‚Ñ¢,9
Starting to think I may regret my comments slagging off Samson,3
Holy fuck this guy doesn't give a shit,10
Samsons pretty confident from the last knock against CSK,5
I am definitely not a plastic RR fan and will definitely not be turning this off at 6pm now Jos is out,15
SAMSON IS OUR ONLY HOPE,10
"Dhoni, see and learn! This is called intent! RR needs nearly 12 an over so they going from the start to have any chance to win.",16
Fuck me in the ass what a shot from this lad!!!!!!,8
Salute to your daddy now cottrell,8
Samson in this stadium is just unfair,7
I still remember the day Samson made that century for Delhi. It was magical. Should repeat it today.,13
Let's see if he can do this whole day,3
The heck with chin masks,7
Dream11 removed the high strike rate bonus and also points for dot balls :/,5
Damn son,3
Don't let Samson ever get a haircut,4
"""Salute this, dick""",6
lmao he's still playing against us,3
India to play wicket keeper 11 in next T20i,10
I want cotrell to strangulate me and than salute me off while I slowly collapse fainting with a boner.,4
As expected Buttler carried away with pressure,2
Sanju and Steve are on here. Also that sounds like the name of a slightly racist early 2000s sitcom,9
Wtf is the point of a Telugu commentary channel if you say everything in English?,8
The spinners are gonna get ripped apart if he doesn't get out soon,4
Let's see if Samson is Gonna do this in Dubai and Abu Dhabi as well,3
Sanju uyir!,5
Smudge,3
Cred ad appreciation comment,1
Buckle up boiiiis,1
"whenever they discuss technique in the combox I take notes like it is somehow applicable to me, a 27 y/o living in America with no intention / opportunity to play organized cricket anytime soon",14
Ffs can cunts stop throwing the ball at Smithy's head?,3
Even Smith's slogging now lol,6
Runrate's a 10. RR on the way to make a perfect 200,3
Smith :: I am the Buttler now.,7
Fucking hell Smudge,1
Imagine scoring 30 off the first 3 overs and still being behind the RRR. We need a Smith and Samson special to win this.,5
okay smudge smack that outta here,6
I wish to channel my inner Samson and give no fucks about my university,6
"fk, not a boundary off shami's ballüòî‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è",1
Cottrell just looks so hittable.,8
I love seeing Steve Smith when he goes at it rather than playing his usual patient game,10
"Smith & Samson

est. 1943",52
Wouldn‚Äôt mind a pair of tons by these blokes,11
1 more wicket in the PP and RR are done.,9
Smiths batting gets weirder the more aggressive he gets,27
"Wtf was that frm smudge. 

Ridiculous",10
Halllaaaa Boolllllllll,5
Yeah this is a wrap. If Smith is hitting like AB it's over,19
Ok this is scary now,8
Maxwell's transition into Maxwinder is almost done.,16
"If Shaminator can take SPD's wicket, I'll consider him the best bowler right now in IPL.",13
**S E R I O U S I N T E N T**,13
What was that shout Smith!!?,10
This Smith guy looks pretty decent,10
Rahul channeli his inner Pant with the appeals.,0
"Same ball given wide in the first innings
.",9
"Smith's like, I told you to go there, why didn't you go there, I fuckin told you to. To the ball.",15
What a shot by Smith,6
This INTENT^TM for the first time in a run chase is making me teary-eyed!,19
Smudge is like fuck being the anchor imma be the star now,14
I kind of low-key miss Navjot Singh Sidhu in the commentary box & pre/post-match shows.,9
Smithy channeling his inner Finchy with that groan. Swear words aren't far away,11
"Shane Warne might be bouncing off the walls but it's not because he can't be here mentoring his side

It's because he's done a massive amount of coke",11
Warne is RR's mentor?,4
Sanju does seem like he has found that crazy gear to shift to right from the start,8
Dammit RR is not opting to not go for a win like CSK. What even is this? This defies the genius of Dhoni.,29
Win or lose smith gonna take home 1 Lakh from the Cred Power play award,5
Who are the weak bowlers in KXIP that RR can target.,3
"KL gets excited everytime the ball touches his gloves, just like my duck on seeing the camera cut to Priety Zinta",2
"Well they‚Äôre on top of the run rate here, might as well call the match",6
Intent‚Ñ¢,3
"Shami: god, I need to bowl the good stuff, don't I?",1
"Some people wank before bed

Smith shadow bats himself to 100 before bed",10
Never saw Smith play This destructively,5
Wtf this doesn't look like a nrr run chase,9
Two SS batting out there,7
"They're dealing in boundaries, would also need to take singles",3
"Fellas Smith might be past it, doesn't seem to have the same hand eye coordination",2
Sixer Shami,2
If smudge pulls this off no one will ever doubt Smith the t20 batsman,13
Who is that lad Archer wanted to kick,4
I like this RR team,8
Why doesn't Shami simply get Smith out instead of conceding boundaries? Strange tactics imo,30
RR is hurrying too much. Playing like they've got nothing to lose.,6
CSK would only bat like in a chase after the RRR is above 36,11
How fucked is that,7
Dancing SPD,8
Arabian camel porn in Sharjah. Of all the porn Smith going at weird angles,6
It's shami bisssh,3
Please don't blow it up Smudge,5
"Lmao that vote, Archer is easily a better T20 bowler than Shami",9
DONT play that shot SMITHWA!!,9
All of Smith's runs have come from boundaries,6
Weird cunt,3
I hope both these teams make the playoffs,6
Stop that shit smithy,9
"The way it's going , the last 4 overs of our innings might cost us",3
Pommie: Warne knows how to write?,6
"This is real intent. He doesn't care if he is out, he just goes at it, and he's not even an explosive batsman.",3
Fuck I can‚Äôt wait for 10 years time when the entire Aussie test team bats like this,8
What Archer just did is very offensive in some cultures hehe,5
"The ramp to square leg, I love it",7
"How are people going after Dhoni for the CSK top order not showing intent lmao

It's not like he tells vijay to go out and be shit",7
Lol he almost holed out,4
"Smith getting a bit desperate here, he's already got 10 off the over, no need to try anything extravagant.",7
Damn good running,6
"Gonna keep an eye on Samson, they may well be his season. He wrecked CSK the last time he batted.",9
"How tf did they get 3 there?

Great running",9
I don‚Äôt think Smith should be playing dumb shots like that. There‚Äôs plenty of time. Wait for the bad balls,5
Even with couple of boundaries every over they are scoring just about 10-11 rpo. Need to play less dot balls,3
Did they just take a 3 .... in Sharjah?,9
When do RR play for NRR? This is inconceivable.,8
"When Buttler inevitably gets going.. an in form top 3 of Jos, Smith and Samson is absolutely fucking lethal.

Followed by Uthappa.",10
Done well there,1
"has anyone seen the movie ""Like Mike"" where a kid gets a pair of magical shoes from Michael Jordan and becomes an NBA star. That's what I feel we are living in for Steve Smith. He doesn't ever ""look"" like an all time great, and him slogging here looks hilarious but it is effective.",8
Orgasmic Elegance from samson,5
"Buttler looked rusty, first game after long quarantine understandable, hope he is back to smash in next game.",8
Royals and Kings... what‚Äôs with all the obsession with royalty?,11
"This ground is injury prone too, terrible ground",2
I am loving the competition between Smith and Shami.,2
Is Shahbaz nadeem still active?,1
Alpha move from Samson to take a 3 on a pitch which is dwarfed by my club ground,7
How many sixes this over,4
AH YES SPIN,5
"Australia are going to have an entire generation of people brought up on Smith's batting who will be emulating him in the nets

The world is not ready for this",12
Exciting phase to see how Bishnoi does today.,3
Have a feeling Sanju might have a go at this bloke,5
Bishnoi vs Samson,3
A lion once sprayed urine onto my face. True story. Visit San Diego zoo if you don't believe me.,4
They're gonna respect Bishnoi,5
When is Ashwin back? (or is he),2
"This whole Dugout bs between overs, and sometimes in the middle of the overs, is really fucking annoying",2
[deleted],13
Sanju Samsix,4
damn that's sex,3
SANJU WITH THE SOUTH INDIAN SLAP,5
Smooth af,3
How many dot balls this match so far?,4
DAMN SON,5
100 IPL sixes at 25 DAMN,11
What a Big Dick SIX,3
"They need 15 runs from this Spinners over.

Edit - they got 11.. Not bad for them. Decent bowling from the spinner",6
"I am the Danger 
- Sanju Samson",9
Spin in power play?,2
"if KXIP can get a wicket here, Uthappa will reward them with a 35(33)",8
Samson's Arc,2
Spinners to Samson after csk game. Rahul not learning,2
Samson trying to hit every ball,3
"Spinners would be key here. Rahul can't bowl out Shami or Cortlell this early. If RR can dominate KXIP spinners.. they could absolutely chase this down.

Only problem his this is the last recognised international batting pair for RR.",2
The genius of Dhoni for me is that he can convince a whole team to buy into NRR nonsense lol.,16
LMAO WTF don't tell me they are actually looking to topple the target,6
Alright I‚Äôm scared now,3
Bishnoi does Garba in his run up,4
"I like that theres one ground where it's just gonna rain sixes, it's fun every now and then",8
Lol look up early if it's pitched up cuz that's where its going,2
Sanju : Okay smith I'm gonna hit one more and take a single,5
I do not want to see Sanju against Umesh Yadav...,11
Who was the fastest to 100 sixes?,4
DAMN SON,5
"I'm so excited about the young Indian players coming through

Hopefully at least a few make it to the national team",8
"yep, nightmare of a game for Bishnoi..",3
Kl Rahul has just stacked the team w/ his mates and is killing life,16
Good battle here,5
"Royals off to a great start, barring Butlers wicket. Exactly what any team should do when chasing a huge target...

Hope these two can go at it for a while, because one more early wicket the chase is done",8
Buttler missed out big time today,14
"Bhenchod, kaisa team hai ye? darata bhi hai hasaata bhi hai 


T: what kinda team is this? Scares the shit Outta me and makes me cry with happiness",10
Bishnoi looks like kid Goku,5
Sanju fucking with the bowler. Did y'all see that last minute shuffle just before he releases the bowl,6
Wouldn't you love to have a Miller in your side right now RR?,7
3 boundaries and 3 dot balls. Hmm..,3
This is exactly how you should chase a 200+ target. Take note.,18
"Even those slow, low pitches where 135 is the par score are probably better than this tbh",4
"‚ÄúSpinners aren‚Äôt real bowlers‚Äù

- Sanju Samson, 2020",16
Imagine actually wanting to chase down a target,15
"Smith - I told you to take a single
Samson - Yes. I just hit a single six",10
I hope CSK is watching this match and taking notes on how to chase big scores.,7
NRR super kings should take note.,6
I really like the look of this Bishnoi guy. Kumble seems the ideal mentor for him.,8
Yoo samson's only 25?! Feels like forever since he debuted,6
Sanju Samson is just fucking belting every loose ball he gets. I don't want rcb to face RR,11
"100th IPL six for Sanju Samson. In IPL2020, he has hit 11 sixes in just 40 balls.",8
"lmao just saw Shahbaz Nadeem ,where is this slow brilliant test spinner nowadays",4
Samson and Deverliah,1
Whatever the result . RR can already be proud that they fought back and had a real shot at the chase .,5
Are they planning  to finish this match asap?,3
"I still think this is KXIP's to lose but at least it's entertaining, rather than the CSK snoozefest ""chases""",6
Why is Rahane not playing for RR?,3
\*Wtf\* who are the batsmen in RR besides the top 3?,3
Sharjah more like which team has a better net session.,4
Nice to see a team actually try to chase after some disappointing run chases in the past week,5
NEESH!,3
0 fucks shami,1
Dhoni probably shaking his head watching this atrocious run chase by Rajasthan. When will these kids ever learn t focus on the NRR,20
"The danger for Kxip now is Samson had taken leg spinner on his remand last game n they have 2

Their 6th bowling option is maxwell n they dont have gun death bowlers

Need to get wickets upfront",4
Even with all this strokeplay. They are just keeping up with the run rate. Need to play less dot balls.,6
Really don't think that Bishnoi should be bowling in the powerplay. He went for a few in the last game as well but bowled extremely well in his other three overs.,2
I'm scared of neesham. I feel they'll attack him and get out,5
Dealing in boundaries,1
Jimmy Jimmy aja aja,1
Oh Devereaux you beaut!,2
Unleash the quiche,3
"The quiche has been unleashed. I repeat, the quiche has been unleashed",2
"Gosh, that was beautiful!",2
If jimmy performs 50% of what he does on twitter... He will be MOTM in this match,3
Ridiculous boundary,1
I have the feeling Smith could have a similar season to 2018 Williamson,5
How does it feel to see a fellow redditor get smacked!?,6
"Ah yes Neesham, I can finally make some ' fantasy points' for his performance",4
"Neesham, Maxwell bowling will be the moment Punjab lose the game",3
Save the game Neesham.,4
Neesham take a wicket,5
Lmao he scooped it over the fielders,3
"Sanju Samson's increasing SRs:

2013: 121

2014: 124.2

2015: 125.2

2016: 112.4

2017: 141.4

2018: 137.8

2019: 148.7

2020: 226.8",12
Looks like wicket keeper batsmen for RR don't give up chasing just because the score is big,5
fuck neesham‚Äôs cute,3
Bishnoi once smoked 3 joints at once. I rolled one of those. Ask him about it.,3
World Cup choker dispatched,1
WTF is Smith trying with the ramp shot,3
Man Smithy has really taken his T20 batting to the next level. Huge difference from last year to this year. Love it.,4
He ain't no neesh he our reddit brooo,2
Atleast there is INTENT,6
Smith emulating Maxwell,2
"Improvised?

Inside out hit over cover is on page 2 of the Steve Smith official textbook.",8
He literally sprinted across the crease there,3
nice to see a chase with some actual intent,9
Wonderful wists,4
Let‚Äôs go Neesh,4
I'm scared for neesh man,4
Swann doing push-ups,2
Steve Smith!!!,3
neesham is kinda cute wtf,7
"RR is top heavy with just 3 and a very thin batting lineup with an over the hill Utappa and unproven inexperienced youngsters in parag and Tom.

Until Stokes comes in beefs up the No. 5 position this batting line up will falter after initial fireworks.",7
Smith looks like Gavaskar trying the ramp shot,5
smudge doing some bharatnatyam on the crease,9
Lmfao Graeme Swann is a legend,3
Graeme Swann is soo Andy Bernard,6
Nice inside out shot,2
The umpire couldn't help but look impressed giving that four!,4
"CSK, please watch this",21
"Smith's batting just giving nostalgia

How he used to be a funky middle order batsman in early days of RR",14
These teams today making up for yesterday's snoozefest.,11
So how much Coke does Swann take,3
Steve Devereaux... Rich man's Shivnarine Chanderpaul!,4
"Hate me all you want, but Dhoni could learn a thing or two from Smith",23
"Every batsman: Strokeplay

Smith: Legplay",18
This what I've missed so much in IPL. Trying to actually win games aka INTENT,65
"Teams going hard from ball 1 , srh and csk left chat",21
Smudgy day today,4
"Smith is more important to his side, because Punjab has other top quality batsmen",11
"Honestly, if any bowler concedes less than 10 RPO on this pitch they are doing a bloody good job",17
okay serve us a Steve Smith special why don‚Äôt ya,11
Redditor not bowling well,27
That was a good ball,4
"Samson has already done it on this pitch, and Smith is Smith. RR have a great chance",6
Archer should come in next,9
how much did rr pay butler? for playing 11 games?,7
My my someone needs to get either of them out,8
lappa,7
Not sure if I‚Äôve ever seen Smith bat with this sorta aggression. He really wants this match,10
Lol what can you even do as a bowler on this ground? Just pray and not try to spray.,7
"NGL, for a long time I thought Jimmy Neesham was James Franklin.",1
Good shot but fuck u smudge,5
"Oh dear, oh dear. Gorgeous Neesham getting battered.",6

Even if you hemorrhage runs I Iove you neesham!,3
yo i thot smart watches were banned by ICC,1
"Has dugout given up commentary, I don't want to see Swann doing push ups.",2
Jimmy is shit,1
Yeah Jimmy tweet nah,10
Neesham is going get dropped without his fault this is just bad time for anyone to bowl.,2
"Neesham cunted, /r/cricket in shambles",8
Looks like Cricket can be entertaining if teams don‚Äôt give up.,10
This is disrespectful,3
Neesham bowling pies,3
how come karma is zero or in negative??,3
">who's more important to their team's batting line up?  rahul or smith


\* rahul with 132(69) last match, scoring 60% of team's runs\*

am I a joke to u",10
Damn Smith just tapping the ground like.. Yeah come on! Bowl another one!,8
"Neesh go tweet about it, since you are too big for Reddit now",9
"That was a ""nice"" powerplay for RR.",12
Splattered.,3
Finally both the teams showing I N T E N T today.,12
Lol I never thought I'd see Smith taking the charge hitting the ball like he is now,9
"KXIP  does best powerplay this season at 60 


RR with 69: hold my lassy!!!",10
After six it's 69,3
Wow. Kitu,3
Smith is determined to bag this game,2
"Ah shot Smithy.

Ganguly used to play that shot, come down the wicket and blast the ball into the offside.",4
What do ya expect giving a redditor the ball,6
"On such flat tracks and tiny grounds, at least watching the 2nd innings is somewhat entertaining",5
When did all the players shoot the dream 11 ads? Pre covid?,3
69 in the powerplay - NICE,3
"As a KXIP fan, I shouldn‚Äôt be drinking watching this.",2
"Bloody hell, we have a game on here, if RR get close, this will be some watching.",1
"Two contrasting styles of play here, the elegance of Sanju and whatever-the-fuck-it-is of smudge",8
It's looking good but sad that they don't have depth in batting. Would've been amazing if stokes was here too,0
Who tf is downvoting all comments,7
Why are people saying RCB didn't try to chase? They clearly did,0
Well I was gonna go to sleep but fuck it Steve Smith it is,5
Damn why isn't RR playing for the nrr.,4
"2:30am here in Aus, I'd honesty stay up all night to watch Smudge bat like this",12
"Different captain strategies for chasing large total: Some captains come up early and go hard, others assume that their day has ended early and let others bat.",7
Man I love watching smith bat,6
"With the return of Sir Stokes team would be slightly balanced. In any case, they need a couple of Indian batsman. DC took all the youngsters.",3
Why does nehra ji's voice sound like hindi dub artist voice,2
anil kumble aged really well. drop your skincare routine plz.,18
What a nice score after powerplay,5
Mayank scored 37 more runs than KL Rahul in 4 balls less.,4

Devereux REALLY wants to win this damn,4
Smith what a Big dick player.,6
Smith needs to keep going. Beautiful,5

Hmm seems like someone has mistaken the downvote button for the ‚Äúim gay‚Äù button,10
"This is bonkers but I think Smith's bat has shorter handle compared to norm and longer bat face, those extra few inches matter...",6
"SMith to Bishnoi - 'I used to be an 18yo Leg Spinner, eat this '",9
Looks like the serial downvoter is here,4
Wicket alert? You mean 6 alert?,5
Steve Smith to star in a movie titled 'No time for Tuk Tuk'.,14
I don't know how long Smith's innings will last but so far I am enjoying every bit of it.,6
"Meh , shame Buttler couldn‚Äôt have hung around",1
"ESPN commentary::::-

   Now begins Smith's test. So far he only had to clear the 30-yard circle even when the bowler outsmarted him. Now the field goes back. Will he assume the anchor role now? Bishnoi to continue....

*Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, SIX runs*",12
I love the Smudged Samsung combo,4
Wtf is happening?,2
"In every match, I see Sarfraz's boxer.",2
Steve 360 Smith.,5
Captain setting the tone for the chase. So unexpected!,3
These two or atleast one of them needs to finish it for RR. They can't leave more than 50-60 for the last 5. KXIP bowlers would have figured out the pitch by then.,7
"RR need to be super duper careful here. That weak ass middle order with Chuthappa can't chase this. If one of these two get out before over 15, it's 2 points to KXIP.",11
Smith batting is porn,6
ima send hugs to Bishnoi after the game! poor fella,8
"Saying Bradman and Smith are in the same conversation is ridiculous. 

Bradman was never this good.",13
Shocked that Smith hasn‚Äôt tried to reverse ramp that,4
Smith is a champion. Would not put anything beyond his reach,9
Smith not got no time for singles.,6
Bishnoi is pretty good talent,5
Is Smith  Australia's best  T20 batsman?,7
I am straight up not feeling good right now. Ashwin will be smacked today,5
"Still advantage Punjab. One loose shot here from Smith, and it‚Äôs game over for Rajasthan",11

This match is on steroids,7
20 minutes ago - Why‚Äôs Steve Smith opening?!??,10
Sarfraz Khan is fat,5
Top notch effort by Cottrell there.,6
Amazing from Sheldon,6
Cottrell is such a gun fielder,10
First successful dive to stop boundary in this IPL I watched,6

BC downvoter is back,3
"Kumble , please do something",3
Feels so weird to be enjoying a Steve Smith innings,9
2 runs saved could be the difference between a win and a loss in this game. Well done.,7
Holy shit he actually saved that run,8
These sixes are massive compared to the ones I recall from the 90s in Sharjah. Modern strength training and power hitting really is at a whole another level,4
"Smith: *Smashes a six*

Cricinfo commentary: Can he flight it into that spot again and again? He might get a wicket",7
Clearly this ground sucks for cricket... seems like its way too easy to score here.,2
Quite possibly the first piece of good fielding this entire IPL.,7
Graeme Swann sounds like Andy Bernard doing an English accent,6
"Fuck! I hate this timeout, it completely changes the batman's mojo.",6
Didn't know TVS made GPUs,1
Really good effort from the soldier,3
"everything that Cottrell does, i laugh! as simple",2
Both teams are playing entertaining cricket. Nice change from the earlier matches where Intent^TM was missing.,3
RR already holds the record for highest successful run chase in IPL history. They chased 213 of DC back in 2008 ( not sure about the year),3
The overrate in this match has been so good. Mind you 220 is playing 70+ in 7 overs already. Kudosüëè,3
"This game reminds me of MI chasing KXIP's 230 in 2017. Fell just 7 runs short, scoring their highest ever team total somehow",5
"Perfect chase, singles when needed, boundaries when needed. Perfect batsmen on the crease.",3
Who is downvoting everything,5

I love the energy Cotrell brings to the field.",9

Guys it's time for the strategic ad placements,3

[deleted],11
When I saw that paralympian in the ad the last fucking thing I expected was seeing Whitehat Jr.,7
Were the boundaries of this ground always this short? These batsmen make hitting 6s here so easy as compared to the matches of the 90s.,5
"fuck this timeout bc, completely changes my mood to watch the game or not..",10
Is this the desert storm stadium?,7
What a run chase man !!,3
"I really hope Smudge stops with these random ramp shot attempts.

Leave that shit to Buttler or Maxi, you keep doing what's working for you Smudge. Be your weird self.",3
Fellow Bob Willis Trophy refugees?,2
Karol Justin is the Oppo Girl.,2
Rajasthan is competitive but Buttler being out means a ton of pressure on these 2. One more wicket falls and Punjab will be heavy favourites,2
Is dugout better than English comm. They just seem to be gambling on wicket and doing their shenanigans instead of commenting. But has less ads,2
I just want to say i am happy Delhi is not shit anymore.,8
"Who should come in next?

Miller or Robbie?",5
Bruh this chintu is gonna eat my job,9
"I know Buttler is a gun opener but if Smith can bat like this up top, RR would be better off opening with Smith Jaiswal and sending Buttler at 4. Their middle-order is paper thin. At least until Stokes returns, they gotta do this.",11
Smith is batting a lil too good for me to get comfortable ova here,10
"coding nai sikhenge,jidhar dikha waha kaan ke niche pel denge bc saale.",5
Aalaporaan Tamilan!,3
"This is intent. 

Hopefully CSK are watching this,

the less said about RCB the better",6
Fucking White Hat jr my dad asked me how my coding skills are.,16
this partnership should ideally go to around 150. RR middle order is not the greatest,10
"In between, Essex are the winners of the Bob Willis Trophy. Their third first-class title in the last four seasons.",9
Now is the best time to MANKAD Ashwin - Lite,5

The fact that Sky Cricket has long ads for ED treatment and hair growth treatment says a lot about the fanbase of the game in the UK.,5
RR spinners were taken to cleaners during middl overs. It all depends on how RR plays spin,2
Wristy Ashwin has a good googly.,1
*Intent*,1
r/cricket already writing Ashwin off so he is defs getting wickets now,5
"MS confused by this new NRR strategy that Steve Smith is employing. He calls it ""winning a game strategy"" apparently.",5

HOLY SHIT,10
WOW,10

Quick someone post that on r/sports,51
This is just the best fielding effort I have ever seen!,14
That is honestly the best one of those I‚Äôve seen,18
HOLYY FUCKING SHIT...,9
He fucking saved 4 runs the absolute mad fucking lad,11
"Poo-fucking-run 

Very well done.",5
Wozers,5
Air Pooran,7
I would keep Pooran in this team for that insane 4 runs he saved.,9
That is unbelievable,7
Maxwell stops to say wtf was that,7
That's the best piece of fielding in the IPL so far.,12
Daaaaammm.,9
What the fuck!,7
Behnchod,6
Chris Lynnesque save,3
What the hell was that,9
Indian batsmen need to learn about intent from smudge. Most would've shat the bed like they did last year.,9
Insane save,7
Man that's not allowed!? Fuckin GENIUS,11
Holy Shit!! Real life Super Pooran,8
Wow,7
WTF take my money pooran,12

Doesn‚Äôt get any better than this!,16
Holy fucking shit Pooran,19
Amazing Pooran!!! Freaking Amazing!!!,14
Thats insane!,8
Maxwell gave up on Pooran too,8
This is definitely the best boundary save ever.,12
Pooran's save is magic.,6
OMG!,8
I am calling that a deepfake,18
Unbelievable. What athleticism.,14
NO WAY,10
Most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve seen in the field,13
Mental fielding,9
So Gayle won't have done it,6
HOLY FUCKING SHIT,6
That is some of the best fielding I have ever fucken seen,10
That is sensational from Nicky P!,8
"Had Maxwell caught it, it would have been greatest catch of all time.",7
Holy fuck that's outrageous.,8
"So RR had luxury for 6 bowlers so they could have spinner bowling one over.

KXIP will have to bowl their heart out with 2 spinners on this pitch.",3
Truly an unacademy learn from the best moment.,5
I'm trying to figure out the physics behind that,8
That is crazy!!!,2
Holy cow. That's probably the most acrobatic save I've seen,6
Downvoter won‚Äôt downvote that,1
That's what you do when Jonty Rhodes is your fielding coach.,2
This game is just game between feilders and batsmen.,3
Just imagine if someone had actually caught the relay fuck,10
Su-pooran-man,13
Ah our fielding coach is jonty makes sense,10
Give him man of the match,6
"Wow, this would the most sensational of all fielding saves",4
BRUH THAT FIELDING,5
Who is that,2
"What what what da fuck was that? Un-fucking-beilivable !! No, i don't wanna believe this. This is not real. Nicholas Pooran, you are a maniac !!!",9
"Ngl i(maybe we all)thought KL gonna be the aggressor with Mayank as support and Jos is gonna be aggressor with Smith being support.

But second fiddle took the main stage today.",6
IPL FIELDING,7
Holy shit sensational,7
That's the greatest save I have ever seen in my life,5
Oh my god!,5
Think that is genuinely the best piece of fielding i've ever seen,18
"the batsman who hit that out for the boundary :

wait, that's illegal!!!",8
Best I have seen too!,6
"Andy Flower and KP having a chat

Do they have any bad blood or did it happen after Andy Flower left?",2
That is the best thing I've ever seen. And I've seen some tits,14
Best league in the world. Good lord.,11
Someone very hate full is down voting all the comments. Wonder who could it be.,8
That would have been the best catch ever if completed successfully. Still one of the best saves ever!,6
Only if Maxi was closer and that‚Äôd be the dismissal of the season,20
Holy shit pooran,11
I came,6
Every bone in my body creaks seeing Pooran do this.,13
Wtf was that pooran!!,8
KP interviewing Flower lol,12
"I'm not one for sensationalism, but I'd say that's quite good fielding",21
My jaw fell to the floor and I can't find it now,10
[https://i.imgur.com/YPn3eJn.gif](https://i.imgur.com/YPn3eJn.gif),1
Can't believe Andy Flower's a T20 coach lol,9
Thats unbelievable! How's he saved that?,4
holy shit that's quite possibly the most impressive fielding moment ive ever seen,10
what the fuck,9
Thats fucking absurd,10
WHAT THE FUCK!!! You can't do that! You just can't do that. That's insane.,16
that is the greatest fielding effort I have ever seen in my life and I have seen some spectacular fielding,11
Best fielding effort I have ever seen,6
THE BEST,5
Samson is more pissed,3
Holy fuck....save of the tournament right there from Pooran.,12
DC comics presents ~~superman~~ **POORAN**,10
Pooran having a good game tonight after pissing badly in the first 2 games.,2
WTF is the third umpire doing,3
He took it one handed also holy moly,9
Takes notes rohit,6
What a goddamn effort,8
Lmao gets hit for a 6 anyway,10
Can they actually give that the catch because it fucking deserves it.,14
Not stopping that one mate,10
that's the best piece of fielding I've seen in a long longg time.,15
No saving that one,14
"Well, their fielding coach is Johnty Rhodes for a reason.",14
"Bruh wtf has happened to samson. Holy shit, on the up.",6
Best fielding I have ever seen and I have watched a lot of cricket.,7
999/1000 times that‚Äôs a six,9
Best save EVER. Jesus christ!,11
Samson : Fetch that Nicholas,3
"That's fucking sick, why is BCCI letting aliens play",9
I don't mind 3rd umpires taking multiple takes. Maybe he is impressed too,10
Sanju be like try saving that,6
Nicolas superpooran,5
Samson has gone ape ahit,3
"Samsons like ok , I will hit you again try stopping that",7
"If you bowl in the slot, you're getting spanked",6
"A Mallu doing well in Gulf, this was expected.",13
Yeah!! Save that one!!,5
EXCEPTIONAL!!!,3
The third umpire knew it was not a SIX after the first slow motion. He just saw the replay so many times to appreciate the effort.,11
KXIP Fielding is insane so far,2
God damn that was some exceptional fielding.,10
Sam-Big-Dick-son,3
Don‚Äôt bowl there to Sanju,6
Ah yeah the very next ball is smacked,5
Probably one of the best fielding efforts I have seen in a long time,5
That is outrageous. Holy shit,6
Still can't get over that save,6
"oof, no Pooran can save that",4
Low-key  WTF moment: KP and Andy Flower talking civilly to each other.,10
Samson: Stop this one motherfuckers,16
I think you angered samson with that,8
"I‚Äôm sick of jerseys being fucking walking billboards. Print the players name below the collar, not fucking ambuja cement or whatever steel",9
K then I'll just make it bigger,12
I don't believe that even our best Jadega can pull this off.,4
"Samson, after not getting a 6 last ball :

I'll fukin do it again!!",19
Samson gameplay has been so impressive,6
how tf did he get the momentum in his arm mid-air to fling that over? unbelievable!!,3
"That was insane, imagine if there was a fielder behind him",3
Samson pissed lmao!!!,2
Murugan Ashwin just did the Pakistani meme guy pose,9
The best piece of fielding in IPL so far. Brilliant from Pooran,5
[deleted],17
"Downvoter, we know you have a sad life. We have only pity for you buddy",8
"Tbh can't blame Unadkat or any of the bowlers, this ground's just shit to bowl in",12
I still can't believe that didn't go for a six!,11
Time for Chris Gayle to leap,5
No one saying faf wud have caught that this time,9
CATCH that motherpooran,8
"I wish that had ended in the other‚Äôs fielder as a catch, cuz then it would be celebrated as arguably the greatest play in all of sports. 

Unfortunately this will be forgotten by cricket fans by end of season itself. 

But seriously, GODDAMN what a play",16
Best league in the world,3
Bowl a few more overs of spin KL,3
Unpopular opinion: that should be a six,-4
What is the Highest run chase in IPL?,3
damn that's some fielding. incredible.,10
Samson wtf?,8
"Samson be like, I am gonna hit again.",11
"Mann.. FUCK this interview.

We need more appreciation for that pooran save.",24
LMAO GANJU SALA,5
Just for that save they have to remove 10 runs!,13
"With the kind of form Samson is in, it will be a real shame if he is not picked for India this season.",14
Ashwins reaction is Indian version of that Pakistani world cup dude meme,19
Pooran holy shit.... That's illegal mate!!!!,14
It should be illegal to hit every ball for a six :|,6
Great Fielding,6
Pooran won't stop that one,6
Is that fielding illegal? Call the police I'd like to report a crime.,8
are the pitches a lot more flatter this ipl? I don‚Äôt remember teams only losing 2-3 wickets max almost every game before,2
Please let Sharjah host all the remaining games. This is eyebleach after yesterday‚Äôs game.,14
Andy will be getting the KXIP XI off to SAS bootcamp in Germany if they don't win this,9
"There's no fans, they could take the advertising boards and boundaries a little further back",7
I've seen some genuinely brilliant fielding in my life but that might be the best,38
Were the many replays to admire the effort or check if it was a six,18
RR down to 10.93,11
Retirement home players perplexed watching both batting and bowling sides making effort to win,22
That was some Chris Lynn level shit,12
The required rate is under 11... Do RR have this under control?,12
The best save ever only to be followed by that shot,11
Nice to see KP and Andy Flower getting along,11
[removed],32
Did they stop play to replay that orgasmic save?,6
This so far is a big bold beautiful **FUCK YOU TOO** from RR,9
Smith has been in 40s for 2 overs. Time to drop him I think,4
Every Spinner ball that doesnt go six against samson is a win,7
Do the commentators have a requirement to talk about young Indian talent every time they interview someone?,8
That's why they say don't judge a batting performance until both teams have played..,4
sanju: damn that's some fielding good job.. **anyway**,6
This match makes up for yesterday's snoozefest,6
Smith is playing this real smart now. They are aiming to get one six or two fours in an over and then take singles. Real smart.,7
"All our foreign players are absolute gun fielders. Pooran, maxi, neesh and Cottrell",9
this is absolutely top of the class batting,4
Yesterday's match was covid. This match is the vaccine.,13
"Pooran actually saved 4 runs, have a feeling this will somehow matter",8
That would've been catch of the decade if there was fielder behind him. Outrageous stuff,8
We are either getting all out on 150 or chasing this no NRR bullshit,3
"Samson to pooran be like ""I can do this all day""",15
"Samson : 

u won't be able to save it, if I hit it father.


modern problems require modern solutions",5

They should play all matches in this ground tbh.,4
Pooran > Kepa,9
">reminds me of a young scott styris


was styris really that good in the field or dugout comms trolling again? üòÑ",3
"If the required RR drops below 10, I'm calling the game",1
Who TF is Daniel Alexander and why does he hate India lol,1
Which ground has the most balance between bat and ball ?,3
Still not over that inhumane save,9
"If that was a shared catch, it would have been the greatest of all time and nobody would fight it.",9
It was so sensational that Maxwell was just not ready for the catch.,9
What the fuck is Samson on?,7
Sanju Samson is playing well because a Mallu always performs in UAE.,18
*typing furiously something witty before the topic chang...*,11
I feel Pooran is better than Hetmyer,9
M fucking scared now. Someone please get a wicket,4
Andy Flower doesn't have an Afrikaner accent at all!,10
"A thought: With specialists like bowlers and batsmen, there should be a team motivator on the ground for these kind of grounds. One can only take so much beating without letting your morale down while fielding and bowling. Fucking slugfests",3
"Smith and Samson on crease


Hide your spinners",1
Well... He gothim on the next ball,1
Scott styris calling it out lol.,2
Sanju Samson is the GOAT,7
Unleash on neesh,2
"By the end of this IPL, bowlers should be treated for PTSD",6
samson my man. that's class,5
Clean,2
"Guys that's the best piece of fielding i have seen. And, no, credit doesn't go to Jonty. U can't teach anybody that in that short a time. It's Pooran all the way. This is next generation of fielding.",6
This is too fuckin easy for Samson,5
Can anyone tell me who is commentating with KP and LSK?,2
I have a feeling these 2 batsmen will take the match very close only to get let down by the middle order. Reminds of certain Indian batsman.,8
Looks like RR will chase this down in 15 overs.,0
The ground is a joke,2
"DJ Punjab fan confirmed, playing dheeme dheeme for Smith and Samson lol",6
Sanju can hit fours? And without an edge,4
C'mon RR just break your own record,1
So RR had some trash fielding and KXIP pulled off the fielding move of the tournament.,2
"Both striking at 200 , this is good.",2
Quiche!,2
The redditor is getting tonked,6
Even Pooran's unbelievable save couldn't bring a smile to KL's face,3
Samson looks like the classiest batsman in the world when he is in flow. Why isn't he given more chances in the national team?,6
[removed],3
Someone need to get some kryptonite and meet me at DXB airport. I have a hypothesis to test about this lad pooran.,6
I still can't believe how Pooran got rid off the ball ffs,5
Reddit pie chucker,3
"Block singles , get a wicket",2
Rahul too slow,2
If Maxwell had caught the throwback from Pooran!!!,6
"If there‚Äôs anything I can say right now is that this ground is fucking horrible, no match should ever be played here",1
Sharja but in EA sports,2
Atleast Sharjah DJ doesnt annoy us with the sudden cheering noises,2
tbh i'm sick of the MI-CSK hegemony. high time for the RRs and DCs to rise and make IPL a truly unpredictable tournament,11
bajvskskskgsdbh Pooran..üòØ,3
This season could be an entry for Samson into the national team,3
Wish Umesh Yadav was bowling to Samson here. What a sight that would be.,4
A wicketkeeper who is also outstanding at the Boundary a rare sight this.,2
Pooran's fielding has got nothing over Dwayne Leverock's catch in World Cup,2
Get someone out,3
fuck pant. sanjus my wk batsmen,6
This would be the highest ever successful ipl run chase,4
Wtf was that,6
"Knowing this duh obvious, but KXIP really need wickets to win this. They don't have the bowlers to slow down the game atm",3
Haha what,5
Measured approach from RR so far unlike the insanity we saw from RCB,6
what did smith just do.,12
Neesham for the memes.,6
I am sorry you can‚Äôt stop Smith on a pitch where you can‚Äôt even stop Samson.,6
what the fuck was thia delivery,3
Yes Neesham.,4
"What the fuck happened there lmao

Wtf was that bounce",6
"after watching RR and KXIP bat, i feel like they're playing on a different level altogether.",4
Lol Jimmy what was that,7
100% of all the redditors playing the IPL is having a bad day...,11
What the fuck was that delivery,7
SS good fifty üòÑ,4
How slow was that ball,3
Lmao Smith wtf,4
"Neesham ahead of Mujeeb is pretty questionable a move

Edit* lmao bad timing indeed",4
Smith is pulling kane 2018,1
Not a bad ball if it only concedes a single haha,7
Oh Neesham thats pretty poor line n length. I wish real Cricket was as easy as typing on Twitter.,4
Wtf was that shot hahaha,2
What the fuck was that ball,6
We need to bring back cotrell and shami,2
Redditor shitposting on the cricket field,6
Neesham shitposting on the field. Based.,8
Wait wtf happened there,3
"Uhhh.

 Is KP okay?",2
If Koach scored 50 in 26 he would have jumped and screeched like a chimpanzee for 5 mins straight,8
"I was told Samson sucks because he only scores in the first match then is trash.

But I'm not seeing that here.",7
"Good over so far, only 7 runs",8
IPL smith is better than australian smith for t20s.,9
Neesham shitposting in matches instead of reddit and Twitter.,8
"Look at all these boundaries followed by a single.   


 SunnyG must have came in the pants by now",8
Samson currently has the most sixes in ipl 2020.,7
Neesham's funny on twitter and on the field too!,1
"Sanju's got some swag. Pant out, Samson in. Dude deserves to wear a blue shirt consistently.",4
"TIL redditors can't bowl for shit


Edit: TIL redditors are amazing bowlers and can dismiss the likes of Smith",13

Jimmy Neesham trolling online and trolling IRL,9
"Lmao ""The worst ball ever bowled""",8
Jimmy bringing out the Redditor in him,16
Neesham nearly bowled that on to his own foot haha,5
Finally a redittor has a wicket.,12
How many kmph was that Smith ball?,2
Fuck,5

Ahh atleast he hit a fifty,2
Smudge 50*,2

"If they send in Uthappa, imma loose my shit.",7
Neeeeeshaaaammmmm,1
Steve Smith gets out to a redditor,9
"""It's all about maintaining momentum.""

Steve Smith gets out next ball.",8
Yes he is fellow redditor. Obviously he takes a wicket.,7
Guess it‚Äôs the redditor to save the motherfuckin day eh?,10
grandpa uthappa gonna tank this completely now.,4
It was good while it lasted.,3
Mark this thread NSFW mass orgasm incoming,7
"I think there should be fielding ranking too. Fabian Allen, jadeja , hardik and many are saving runs and taking unbelievable catches making the matches turn",5
Yes our brother getting a wicket!!!,6
Noooooooooooo,3
"Pretty much all down to Samson now

Can't see anyone else doing much",5
Highly irresponsible batting by these two. Why take unnecessary chances before the required run rate reaches 40 rpo?,9
Samson has to do it from here. Don't trust the other batsmen to hit sixes.,5
"Robbin ""tuk tuk"" Uthappa",8
Please don't send in utappam,3
Thats not good news for RR,3
Next is Lord Robbie?,2
"every single redditor playing the IPL has taken Steve Smiths wicket..


coincidence? I think not!!",10
Neesham just won the game.,2
That is not ideal,3
Finally a r/Cricket shitposter has an IPL wicket .,12
Let's goooooo,2
KXIP needs an Uthappa master class to win this from here.,7
Robbin utthapa needs to peform now,3
Good knock but LOL Smith out,0
What is a tewatia exactly,3
"Well played Smith. Even if RR lose the match, you have my respect.",7
"That should be the game for Punjab, there are no batsmen left.",5
This whole sub is now fapping to death about neesham,7

Ace card of Punjab coming uthappa,5
RR needs Stokes asap..,3

"Who is Robbie gonna rob today ?

RR or KXIP ?",4
Uthappa going to smack everything after hearing all the smack talked,2
Promote Archer as pinch hitter if they lose another wicket,8
poor sportsmanship from Neesh. Disrupted Smithy's flow with that shit delivery,3
If Robbie comes in the match is as good as lost. Man they're going to miss Ben stokes,4
"Smith must be liking it here in UAE, because of the sand... /s",1
"That ball was genius Jimmy. Gave only one run and while Smith is still distracted by how silly that was, his wicket is taken. Thinking outside the box.",10
Will rr recover from this?,1
Archer,1
Now Samson needs an absolute blinder. Smith has to be there for another 5 overs or so to have a proper shot at this,4
Tewatia? At 4? Is this the tail?,3
One of us! One of us! One of us!,1
omg they sent a bowler in to bat. wtaf.,2
"Lol Mr Robbie is a cheerleader for RR

Tewatia in at 4",4
"Good move to promote the leftie to target the leggies.

Gaywatia and his earplugs are back,2
"Steve Smith after getting a fifty :

My time has come.",3
Rajasthan has a bigger tail than SRH damn,4
Neesham will tweet about this very moment when England bowl helplessly to Smith in the next Ashes,3
Damn RR seem to be doing well and here I for sure thought that they would become another victim of the seocnd innings curse.,2
And the batting is over,2
I hope RR don't send in Robin Uthappa next,0
Neesham just gave  twitteratis an orgasm,2
For some reason tewatia seems very irritating,3
Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.,8
Tewatia instead of Uthappa. Okay.,1
Is tewatia good?,3
"I have a question. If a fielder on the boundary is sure that the ball is going over the boundary for a six marginally but he cant take a catch because its a bit high, can he position himself inside the boundary as the ball is coming and as just as its within reach, the fielder jumps and catches it and throws it inside while he is in air, or just jump and slap it inside, no need to catch and throw it inside quickly. Is there any rule against it?",4
Tewatia is such an odd option,3
I hope that Neesham slower bouncer becomes a new variation in itself. Would be fun to see what players do.,2
"Wtf Robin Uthappa and Parag is the middle order.

Game over.

Too big of a task for Samson.",7
Too much to do for RR now?,3
Everyone on r/cricket to Neesham : Do that again!,5
The TWAT is in boys,-1
uthappa to win it for kxip,1
KXIP's social media accounts doesn't have as many lassi moustache photos as I had expected of a Punjab team :(,5
That‚Äôs probably the game,3
Why are they into their tail already at 2 down,5
Folks forget Neesham was part of the team that shared the last World Cup.,11
Neesham looking forward to ceat time-out so that he can run and check this Sub,7
inb4 Robbie 28(30),3
Why is Twatia in? he's going to waste a review and looked ordinary last match,5
Wait why is the tail in already,2
Samson gonna fuck maxi lol,2
"Just looked at the Batman's to follow, looks difficult for royals.",5
Surely Samson takes this for 36,2
Rahul Tewatia is batting two positions too high.,2
[deleted],5
What the fuck is Tewatia doing out there,3
That's what is legitimately called an Intent,10
why did they drop jaiswal.,3
Going for a left right combination. Could work out.,3
Maxi giving no shit,5
"Can't blame smith, only had 8 off the over, needed to keep up with rr, big run chases will do that.",5
Lmao tewatia in,3
Why is a Tewatia?,2
Lol what Tewatiya?,2
Archer needs to bat higher. He's the next Russell in the making.,5
Tewatia on the crease lol no trust on Robbie whatsoever,16
Twatia will play for his average,5
MR. TEWATIA,3
And I jinxed it,3
Chad move sending in Maxi,4
this is such defensive tactics from RR. send in your best batsman. how tf is tewatia gonna manage a rrr of 12?,3
What is a Tewatia?,3
Smudge would be filthy getting out to a crab like Neesham.,3
Need at least half decent hitters here.,7
Wanna see how far can Sanju take them,3
Game changing wicket I say.,10
Lol this is a joke really?,6
You guys think RR have a genuine chance from here onwards?,2

Niw let's get this Samson mf out and we move !!,2
Ahahahah you expect tewatia to chase this?,5

CHADXWELL,3
The fuck is Maxi doing there?,3
KL trying to get 2 cheap overs from maxi,7
KP finally seeing some iNteNt,1
This middle order is total crap shouldn't have dropped Miller,8
Maxwell defended 2 I think of last over against Pakistan.,8
Imagine the state of this sub if Robbie runs out Samson today.,9
This just shows that Uthappa literally cannot be trusted,9
RR badly need a player like Stokes.,10
"It really was, quite possibly, just the absolute dumbest motherfuckin decision to remove Yashasvi today",11
"Great captaincy by KL, get a wicket and sneak in a cheap over from Maxwell",6
Twatia will run Samson out,3
Someone has got to shave Samson's head.,3
Rahul Warner Tevatia,2
You all heard about Left arm pacers being tougher to face because most batsmen don't face em alot in the junior levels! I'm wondering how bad would have been if he was right armed!,1
maxi aganist this samson i?,2
Not much of Jew tonight.,3
Tewatia? This is going to be hilarious either way.,5
Stop Ashwin and bowl more of maxi.,4
It's sad that so many of my casual cricket watching relatives don't even know how good Steve Smith is because they don't follow test cricket much,9
"If Tewatia scores a 50 in under 30 balls, I'll personally give him a handjob",28
Tewatia showing Maxi his best Maxi impression there,9
Just a matter of time before Samson is out.,6
Anyone has any link of the megathread of the match where Ashwin mankaded ?,4
"if Samson will pull this off..i am f*ckin gonna pray to this guy everyday..i will make his pic as my home screen wallpaper, lock screen wallpaper and my desktop wallpaper.. forever..üòÇ",12
Tewatia simply in the wrong mindset. RR is done,2
If they wanted a Pinch hitter they should have sent Archer,5
Why is Uthappa even in this side if Tewatia comes above him,5
Why isn‚Äôt Stokes playing? When will he start?,2
Game is done. Atleast RR tried,1
"Shami , Cottrell, Bishnoi and Neesham all thave given 22 off 2 overs",2
A 3 run over by Maxwell... such gold.,4
Good captaincy from Rahul,7
Even Maxwell can't believe what happened last over.,6
Seems like virtually it's over for RR. I wont back anyone in this lineup other than Smudge and Samson to score 120 odd in 10 overs,3
"Economies of all KXIP bowlers 11,11,11,11,12

Economy of Maxi : 3",11
"Really needed a boundary this over, Samson looked off against Maxwell.",5
What the actual Gorilla fuck with this reverse sweep and switch shots today,5
I can‚Äôt believe they let Maxwell get away with 5 runs,7
one more wicket and kxip are right back in it,3
why tewatia?,2
All chase excitement gone,10
KXIP getting away with murder with such a cheap Maxwell over in this chase,6
Archer should come in next,3
RR missing Killer Miller who would've played his once in a 5 years knock to chase this down.,9
Lol I‚Äôll never get tired of watching Dravid sell cars at gunpoint,4
"Tewatia trying to be budget ABD, Chewtiya.",8
Man RR should just pick Manan Vohra and ask him to twat the ball out the park every over. Surely that'd still be a better option than having Uthappa in the side.,9
Is RR going for NRR now?,5
This is where you take it Deep,3
"Samson needs to put prize on his wicket. Chase would remain alive because of him only.

There is a time for intent and then there is a time to be smart about your batting",4
They should have sent Archer,8
Why tf wud u send tewatia at 4 lol,5
Well that over really fucks things up. Tewatia gotta swing or he gonna put extra pressure on Samson,5
Congrats kxip,3
There goes the momentum,2
1(4) lmao gg twatia,2
This is such a crazy game. The crowd would have gone mental if they had been allowed,6
"maxwell's equation has never been more clearer

there it is.. wanted to be the first to say it",2
The only time Uttahapa would have been useful is against the spinners.Why are they holding him back?,6
"Expectation: Jonty rodes, reality:Sarfaraz Khan",2
How did smoth get out? I missed it,3
Tewatia pls prove r/cricket wrong,5
Yeah the chances of RR winning from here are almost non existent. That 3 run over killed all momentum,4
fuckkk andrew mcdonald. total cuck leadership group in RR.,1
Tewatia is killing this chase.,3
Feel sorry for tewatia,2
Retire him out,1
Why is tewatia trying to defend?! Its a 200+ run chase. Smack it!!,3
Twatia is gonna kill the game,3
You had to take risk with Uttappa RR.,3
Tewatia batting like a no11,3
"Swing you idiot

The only thing you have to do",5
"Wait, there are no other batsmen in RR after top 3?",5
"Imagine keeping Uthappa in the side over Jaiswal to bat him at 5 at best lmao

Jaiswal can bowl as well",4
Twatia doing his best to get Sanju's wicket.,6
that type of helmet is cursed mind ya,1
Send in Parag! He impressed everyone last year! Sorta like Samson in 2013,6
Whose idea was to send Tewatiya!!!,2
"Neesham has a cool wiki page:

James Douglas Elchapo Sheahan Neesham¬†(born 17 September 1890), known as¬†Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n, is a New Zealand international¬†drug dealer, who plays all formats of the game.",9
1 off 5. I hate tewatia after his obnoxious celebrations v csk,2
"The way RR are batting is making me realise, how bad RCB really played",3
1 off 5? Tewatia did not get the memo?,6
Chewatiya,7
Twatia looking good as a dhoni replacement,2
Is Tewatia today's Saha?,2
Game is slowly getting out of RR's hands..,2
1 of 5 he's about to waste a whole over,3
God couldnt send Thala everywhere so He gave Tewatia to RR.,8
You know maybe sending Uthappa or even Curran or Archer would‚Äôve been a better move,5
why is tewatia playing ahead of whoever else is left? I dont understand this.,6
KL Rahul Tewatia?,3
This Techutiya better put on some work out there,3
Why did tewatia come before parag ?,2
Tewatia why bro why,2
Tewatia will end up being responsible for Samson‚Äôs wicket.,2
Get Samson out,2
2 off 6 balls,4
"Just in-- my university has moved all courses to remote for the next two weeks.

They have as much chance of going back face to face as RCB has of winning the IPL",1
Tewatia is doing cameo for RR or KXIP?,3
Tewatia is no Sam Curran. Bad move RR.,3
Riyan Parag would have made more sense here if you don't want to go to Utahappa,7
What a turnaround this Tewatia guy caused after that absolute carnage,5
Why does tewatia exist ffs,2
Samsons the only hope,2
Tewatiya means whore,2
"Tewatia is CSK type player,",2
2 off 6 balls,2
Bumrah will get kohli out,1
Trwatia gonna win KXIP the match,9
Samson or pant?,5
Twatia doesn't look like he could hit a 6 on this ground,7
Why is samson not just farming the strike and clocking a couple boundaries per over,6
Sanju Samson is so fucking good,7
They literally call every game a big one now,2
Remind me again WHY Samson doesn't play for India regularly?,4
Tewatia must be good talker... He gets too many games for too many teams and weirdly enough he hasn't played for RCB yet.,4
Bat has a spring he is cheating,7
Rotate the strike you Twatia!,4
this will endup like raina mccullum right?,12
"Samson will have to do a Pollard, if they are to win",7
This Samson is something,2
"Samson might not be able to do it alone ,need someone to at least stick there and not face many dots",4
So rr is basically second Srh without Stokes,5
Didn't Parag scored a great innings last year why are they demoting him so low,5
"Why is everyone surprised with maxi's bowling, he isn't great but he had some great bowling performances for Aussies and in BBL.",1
Come on redditor just get Samson,6
Should RR have Butler in middle order until Stokesy is back (or Miller is playing) or should he open? I think Uthappa and Jaiswal as openers will add a lot of depth to their core batting.,8
"Tewatia literally means ""prostitute"" in Tamil, lads. You don't even have to add ""chutiya"" next to his name yk.",36
C'mon just stay in game Sanju. You've got this,10
"Look at RR's batting lineup, they dont really have any big hitters now",7
Tewatiya will remove his mask and we'll see a dhoni,20
Why are people hyping up Jaiswal? Is he a gun player?,6
Why does Samson hate the white ball so much? He's beating the hell out of it.,5
"You can go through and finish your shot and the ball from Neesh doesn't arrive until a minute after you finish your shot.

Players with brute force who can stand and deliver can take such slow bowlers on. Batsman who rely on pace and timing will find it tough (especially when they have to maintain the tempo of high RRR).",3
Why did they send Tewatia? He lacks i n t e n t,6
Samson hasn't mistimed a ball,4
fuckall twat. put laxatives in his water and retire hurt him plz.,4
Mugabe would be love to be a batsman on this pitch. Venezuela wouldn't mind it too,3
Tewatia can't even get out if he tries,7
[deleted],2
Twatia keeps the strike. Hahaha.,4
What a fking joke,6
"RR there is an imposter among us.

Rahul send in to play by kumble,3
Weak polio hands of tewatia,5
LSK keeps saying Trivandrum like KP knows where that is,6
Village cricket from Thevaatiya.,3
If he hit that a bit further RR would‚Äôve had a proper chance,9
Yeah r/cricket shit nah on my boy Neesh.,2
Tewatiya chutiya doesn't have the strength to clear even the 30 yard circle,1
Tewatia just not able to smack it. Probably the wrong choice to send here,3
IPL is still going on??! Wild!,0
"'Dukaan se'

Quote of the lockdown",3
"Bruh cant even hit a full toss, Archer would have cunted that",7
"Why is Sanju Samson not backed as much as Pant? His batting skills seem like 2x better than Pant. Holds his shape well and is much more powerful. After KL, he should be the top contender for behind the wickets.",11
This middle order is worse than SRH's,6
Tewatia is here keeping the NRR in mind,10
"lol he can't even hit a full toss to the boundary

pinch hitter my ass",10
FO Tewatia!!!!!!,5
Samson is so fucking good. I wish Kohli backed him as much as he backed Rahul,16
Reckon Neesham scrolls through match threads to see what people are saying?,3
"Tewatia farming the strike, we love to see it",12
Ffs tewatia shots are so waste,9
Tewetia move is soooo stupid.,7
Might as well send Archer next,6
Chadwell back at it,3
Lol why send a guy who cant hit a nice juicy full toss outside offstumps at no 4,5
If only smith had played similarly in that RPSG final xD,6
Surely they have to take Maxwell down,5
"A veg Samsun started eating meat and working out too much for the wicket keeper position.

He deserves every bit of this",1
Slow over rate today?,2
Just try to go 65 from 30 equation and it's gonna be interesting,4
He barely hit a full toss out of the 30yd circle.,4
Swann's banter is dead af,3
keralaites like the middle east. samson in amazing form.,4
Tewatia doing a saha there,7

Twat ko one player shot kar do please,2
20+ run over,2
30 run over incoming,2
Retire out Tewatia,5
Looks like Pietersen Gonna Kill Tewatia just with his words,3
"Man Damage already done with Tewatia on, only he can repair it and doubt it",3
Many teams are suffering from srh disorder this season.,3
Tewatia needs to just touch the ball and run. Run a bye for ffs..just don't remain on strike for more than 2 balls.,2
I genuinely think RR is the only team with a worse middle/tail than SRH. They‚Äôre really missing Stokes,4
Tewatia trying to out meme Saha,13
"KXIP was at 118 at this point, RR still have a chance if Twat gets out and gives Uthappa a chance to support Samson",4
Lol almost thought Tewatia hit something there,2
Does anyone know what kind of form Manan Vohra has been in recently?,2
And the run rate fell as fast as it could,6
Tewatia has ruined this game.‚Äô,5
"Sending Tweatia in, they put a death nail on this game",6
Can we just appreciate that there is no SanjuManju to commentate this IPL?,3
Tewatia acting sus,11
Is Bangar getting paid for his shitty analysis? Or they just keep him there for the lols,3
KXIP quickly pumping out the Neesham Maxwell overs while Tewatia is on strike,3
Who is RR coach? Huge tactical blunder,5
Lmao they're ripping Tewatia,5
Woow maxi,2
Why Tewatia? Why steal that single,5
"Indian fans, why don't we see samson play International cricket?",4
better field placement from kl than smith i think? lots of shots going to fielders.,2
Should get Ben foakes in,3
is Twatia related to the RR Owner who got caught spot fixing,7
Tewatia with some test match sweeps,4
Why is cameraman zooming Uthhapa,3
"Y‚Äôall are forgetting Shami and Cotrell‚Äôs overs are left, this is a chad move by Rahul to play maxwell",6
Tewatia is making us Not miss Uthappa,5
I'm actually hoping Tewati hits his own wicket instead of wasting another fucking ball,3
"if riyan parag's father is not paan parag, I riot",5
Like the other thread said.. retire him out ffs,6
Choo ke Bhaag tewatiya,3
Maxwell‚Äôs gonna somehow bowl 4 overs with 0-21,6
Either of smith or buttler has to be in the middle order. Send uthappa up.,6
Maxwell the best bowler so far..LMAO,10
Chewtiya Tewatiya ko retire out karo,6
Twatia gonna get Sanju's wicket... I said it first.,5
Samson shud start rejecting singles now unless it is the last ball of over,6
This is gonna cost you KXIP,0
Even thr commentators are shitting on Tewatiya,7
[deleted],26
Noooooo,2
These maxwell overs are proving to be goldust,3
Good guy neesh,5
Sanju having to strike for Tewatia too,8
Pinch hitter batting slower than the sheet anchor. #JustRRThings,11
Maxi went off at Bishnoi,6
Who the fuck even is this Tewatia,9
Every team has a Thala in them,15
Fucking Tewatia is gonna get Sanju out. Building pressure like a one sided relationship.,14
Damn costly drop,3
Was that dropped and overthrown runs. The gods are with us today!!!,6
Should've probably sent Parag instead of Tewatia if they really wanted a cameo,8
Would have been Twatiya's fault if that was out,3
Maxwell bowling like Shane Warne now.,7
"Yup, Samson under huge pressure now thanks to Tewatia.",5
"If Tewatia wants his team to win, he should run himself out",6
"Twatia doesn't even look like he could do a chin up

Pinch hit my ass",9
Fucking tom Curran can bat better than this  twat,9
"And that's what's happening, Samson trying too hard with the lack of anything from the other end",8
Rajasthan's tail started at 4 lmao,10
"Robbie could not possibly have batted worse than Tewatia. Why did they not send him up the order?

Tewatia is making Sanju play bad shots!",10
Bitch Nahiii,3
It is games like these which can finish your career. Tewatia should either hit or just hit his stumps and sacrifice at this point.,8
Uthappa looked so said sitting in the dugout seeing tewatia doing tewatia things.,6
"I've always had this doubt - when the captain is batting in the middle, who decides which batsman to send in next? Like does he communicate it, or does the coach or someone make the call. Or do they discuss it in advance.",6
Tewatia finishing the match... for Punjab,10
Just run yourself out tewatiya you fucking dumbass,9
RR have botched this chase with Tewatia,8
Maxi SLAMS Bishnoi,11
Tewatia needs to hit or get out,9
5 in 10 what a god,9
Tuk tuk Tewatia,5
"Tewaita can slog the spinners, not a bad call from Smith to promote him as a pinch hitter. Still don't get why he's not just swinging, 5 from 10 is dreadful from a pinch hitter in a chase like this.",4
Rahul ‚ÄúSaha‚Äù Tewatia.,6
Te(chu)wtiyaüò°,11
Archer was a better option tbh,7
Fuck me dead that‚Äôs a joke,8
Nicely bowled Maxi,6
Tommy would have been smacking Neesham all over,7
Anybody has any link of that pooran save?,4

Stokes might change that once he comes in. Until then..........",4
"Amazing how cricketers like TEWATIA never produce something amazing. I have seen this , many players never break away from their poor reputation",2

Cost them the game,2
Make up for the drop yo. Get a wicket.,1
50 strike rate in 220 match. He should be judge in debate between amit shah and Mamata Banerjee,2

Tewatiya rips off the mask. Its saha trying to redeem himself today.,1
"IF someone like Twatia can play in the IPL

it's a good reason why it should not be expanded to 10 teams

we don't need more Twatia",2
"Tewatia knows that Sanju has immense talent, we can all see it in front of our eyes but the problem is that he‚Äôs crumbled when given a chance at the international level.

So Rahul without any instruction from anyone has taken it upon himself to take Sanju under his wing, he‚Äôs going to soak up balls, NOT hit 4s or 6s or 2s and force Sanju to face the heat and pressure so he‚Äôll emerge .... a diamond on the other side and become the next left handed Kerala Sachin.

SO STOP THE HARRASMENT HE IS DOING THE RIGHT THING",8

My theory is that, in previous seasons the three or four big teams used to hoard all the good ones.

CSK looking at twatia: sign him up. Sign him up now!!!,12
"Team: ""We need a pinch hitter...""

*sends in Tewatia*",12
This match is not fun to watch at all. What's the point if a ground favours the batsmen so much? A decent touch and it's a 4 or 6,1
Next in Jofra Archer ü§î,5
"Can we trade Tewatia back to Delhi in exchange for Rahane? Jinx would at least get a run a ball

Fuck I'd do better. I'd face one ball, get ripped but at least I only ate up one ball",11
King XI have probably save more than 10 runs on the field today.,9
Tewatia playing for CSK next IPL confirmed.,9
55(31) &5(13) lol,7
Feel bad for RR tbh. RR could have focused on stars only but has been giving chances to youngsters since the inception of IPL,2
The one Indian guy in The Dugout always seems akward when the other commentators are bantering with each other,8
Batdeep,2
The best thing Tewatia can do now is get out in the very next ball. Anything else is a crime.,8
First ball wicket,3
"Okay, i just saw the scoreboard. Quick thoughts.


1. Fuck, Punjab's on fire.

2. Wait, what? A team chasing 200+ how it's actually supposed to be done?  *cries in CSK*",2
Need to send Archer next,3
Dhoni for Tewatia - Get this man in CSK,11
Tewatia ruined this run chase for me. If this guy can't hit the ball at Sharjah than he can't do anywhere. Useless.,5
Our 12th manüíï,6
Everybody wants to be dhoni,3
"Bangar when they ask you for your opinion, they don‚Äôt really want you to give your opinion. Read the room.",1

Blame the management for sending in Twatiya,5
"Tewatia - Will have to repeat his ""ear block - noise out"" celebration for next two days......... to keep all the bad words out...!",9
KXIP will be the biggest losers if they try to dismiss tewatiya,10

Why take maxwell off?????,3
"Pommie in commentary.

""Tiwatia , smash it or get out""",19
Haha Rohan Gavaskar speaking for r/cricket,8
At what point do they cut their losses and retire out Tewatia,5
Tewatia teaching Dhoni how to play for Nrr,8
Oh my fucking God. Samson is a God amongst men when he's in form,9
"Tewatia has fucked this, what a prick",11
Why not maxi,3
Pretending Uthappa will do anything better than Twatia .,12
This over can really mean something,3
They sent Tewatia in shattering his confidence while also showing Uthappa how much they trust him. Great freaking idea,7
I would send in RT for the super over and also will bowl him,3
Please please tewatia run yourself out,3
"TIL RR are playing for NRR. 

Preserving wickets for the final flourish!",2
Tewatia to Sanju : Bhai bacha leh yaar log kha jayga muje,1
Sanju needs an absolute worldly here. Has to take on all the 12 KXIP players on the field,8
That's right in the spot asking to be spanked,2
That shot made me nut.,3
I'm getting so irritated here,1
punjabs game plan is not to dismiss tewto.,4
"Someone get on field and tell Techutiya ""Aap Dream 11 kheliye, ye mai kar leta hu""",9

Neesham with the reddit nod of approval for Samson,4

RR coach/Mgr: Am I a joke to you?",5
Simon Doul my man.. speaking out the truth..üòÇ,8

I could watch a million matches at Sharjah. Scintillating batting on display!,3
I wonder who are some decent middle order batsman in T20s?,1
Quiche upvoted that six,2
Kings XI playing 3D chess by not getting Tewatia out,2
These match threads r awesome. Reminds me of those days watching cricket in hostel TV rooms with 50+ ppl. I wish IPL was there back then,13
"If I were Sanju Samson, I'd rather punch tewatia rather than a fist bump

*edit",3
Sanju effortless Samson,6
Can Tewatia do a Pandya here ?,5
Whoever made that call to send Tewatia is in for a treat,5
this what happens when Ronald McDonald is your coach,4
The management only has themselves to blame,8
Bitch is Uthappa next... tragic,5
Lmfao the commentators are ripping Tewatia a new one,11
neesham appreciates,3
Samson doesn't want to give strike to Tewatia,4
"LMAO anybody who is ""strategically retired"" will instantly be put on suicide watch",4
"Robbie is like Imma win you the match, get me in there.",3
Commentators are talking as if it's up to Uthappa to decide whether to go in or not,3
Sanju would be better off farming the strike instead of rotating. Tewatia is just gonna miss them anyways,1
61.... coming now,1
Commentators Samson can replace dhoni... meanwhile tewatia I can be the better replacement,8
If we capture all active users for this match we can eliminate all non-Neesham accounts,3
Don't take singles please,1
Tewatia back on strikeü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,6
RR fans currently googling if Twatia has a social media account so they can abuse the shit out of him once this game is done.,4
Why would you retire out TEWATIA. Robin Uthaapa is nextüòÇ,6
Oh no a single,3
God I hope Tewatia doesn't check his Twitter feed after this match! RR had no right to send a bowling all-rounder up the order like this,7
Why is samson giving tewatia strike,3
Wow man we still have Shami and Cotrell left,1
"Doull saying for all of us here, for Dhoni that is, you never catch up!",1
Why did they send out Tewatia instead of Archer?,5
Worst part of this is that this ruins samson's momentum,6
Samson rather twist his nuts than rotate strike,11
Who suggested retire out on air?,9
Please just get out tewatia. It cannot be more embarrassing than this,5
Sanju single handedly trying to win this game,7
shit move to send this guy in.,8
Tewatia better smash or get out,8
Tewatia following csk strategy,7
What the actual fuck.,5
Tewatia is wasting the most precious resource in T20 cricket. Captain should just force him to retire.,3
Junior Waugh will be delighted more people are agreeing with his idea of retiring misfiring batsmen in T20 cricket.,2
It's not coincidence the name Tewatia contains 'a twat',4
Re bating line after first 3 is just awful!,1
When was the last time his bat touch the ball?,2
Just walk on the stump you dumbfuck,2
Is Tewatia old enough to play for CSK?,7
Just retire out please,5
Dhoni deserved as much shitting on by the commentators.. but their mouths are tied up.,7
KXIP : Don't get him out boys,8
This is painful from Tewatia. Poor lad,3
"Man, everyone's pissed at tewatiya and now i feel bad",6

Tewatia is literally ruining the fun,1
LMAO,1
"Commentators when CSK are 50/2 in 13 overs chasing 170 - *Oh dear dear gorgeous*

Useless cunt even gets hit outside the line. Can't even get lbw,2
"Go Tiwatia , win it for Punjab",1
I feel so bad for Tewatia,3
Hahaha even the commentators are going bonkers in the background,3
Why isn't Sanju trying to get Tewatia run out? There are ways to make it look unintentional I am sure,8
Just walk off mate,3
Tewatia is playing worse than tail,3
Uthappa is like : ‚Äúaur mat bhejo mujhe‚Äù,5
They will retire out Neesham if he takes Tewatia's wicket,3
Jeez Samson is on fire,2
This is why samson doesn't get a call to team india. He gives strike to twats,3
Sanju Samsung on top of using iPhones has a Sony TV at home.,3
Simon Doull is all of us,5
today has been the team selection and tactics so far this tournament.,2

Nidhaas final level PTSD from tewatia,3

Fuck the team management. I blame them more than Tewatia who's fucking useless anyway",3
CAN YOU FUCKING TRY SOME SHOT OTHER THAN A SLOG SWEEP?!,5
just hit your wickets already chutiya tewatia,3
Tewatia üò≠,1
This is truly reminiscent of Yuvraj's epic meltdown in that t20 final.,2
Amazing strike rate. Apt for Csk and SRH,2
Omg this has to go down as the worst innings in ipl history?,5
This is like watching the Scott's Tots episode on the office x10 in terms of cringe,7
Good reception back in the dressing room for this guy,1
I am sure I can bat better than this tewatia guy,2
Both Uthsppa and Tewatiya having their confidence destroyed right now.,3
Can he get out.,1
"Dosto RR pe paisa nahi lagana, behenchod",3
Tewatia batting like a right hander trying to bat left handed,3
 Tewatia ha ha ha,1
Tewatiya playing like a left handed dhoni üòç,5
Who's dick was he sucking to get a promotion,5
"Scenes if Tewatia hits the ball in air and fielder drops it ""accidentally""",12

Tewatia just act like you‚Äôre injured and get the fuck off,5
Man twats confidence is broken. Be gone cry on the pitch,10
"Holy shit tewatia. I feel bad for him, he looks scared every time facing a ball",5
I'm seeing a lot of potential in Twatia to become the next Dhoni,1
40 SR while chasing 225,2
"Tewatiya is going to be a brand ambassador of ""performance anxiety"".",4
Tewatia has graduated from Dhoni school of run chasing,4
I never thougt i wud see shittier inning than Yuvi 11 of 21 in t20,7
Only the bullshit addled brains of Warne could think of Tewatia at this stage.,2

Tewatia chutiye out hoja fuckkk,1
"What I remember is that Robbie Uthappa did a Tewatia last year for KKR , on a must win match in the last stages of the tournament.",2
Punjab would probably drop a catch if Tewatia offered them one rn,9
RR threw the game away by sending out Tewatia. Would have been an amazing chase attempt otherwise.,7
HIs head has to be an absolute pressure cooker rn,3
What did they even discuss in the timeout if he is still playing like this ugh,7
Imagine having a required run rate of 15 and scoring 6 from 15 fucking balls,8
15 balls 6 runs is criminal,9
Csk owners are looking keenly at tewatia,4
Whose ass didn't Robin kiss to be playing there right now,1
Rohan G dishing some truths.,3
Jeez man 6 from goddamn 15 wtf is wrong with Tewatia,3
I don't think people understand the Brilliance of KL bringing in Maxwell instead of the leggies negating Smith's move of getting a Curran out of Tewatia! Brave of a new captain with Samson at the other end!,10
"Take your mask off, Murali Vijay!

We know its you",8
I feel for the humanity now.,3
"Tewatia's, Vijay Shankar movement.  Does RR have Dinesh Kartik?",5
He should just hit wicket now. Fucking hell,7
">Tewatia 6 (15)

What the actual fuck?",6
If I was KXIP I would do my best to not get Tewatia out.,3

What the fuck is this guy doing? I hope he never plays again.,7
Balla ghuma tewatia!!!!!,4
Tewatia pulling a Vijay,6
Tewatia would target Shami for 30 runs in 17/18th over,7
Tewatiya auctioning for test team,3
"Guys tewatia is a bowling all-rounder, RR mgmt fucked up",8
Damn that was a perfect chance to get Tewatia ran out,7
Feel for him though. Poor guy having an absolute nightmare.,28
I feel sorry for him. It's like sending Chahal out there to hit sixes,12
If Tewatia runs out Samson it‚Äôs gonna be the cherry on top of this pie,28
Watching tewatia is like watching Vijay Shankar from that bangbros match.,24
Lets make Tewatia Academy a thing,7
Was that a leading edge? What's Samson's fucking bat made of haha,6
Smith undid all his good work with this bit of braindead captaincy,15
HOW FUCKING STUPID I WAS thinking RR would win,7
Newfound respect for saha today,6
Jeevandaan,5
Should've taken that second run to run out the Twat,8
"RRR: 15 runs off every 6 balls

Tewatia: 6(15)

It's okay boys he just has dyslexia",27
Take a single last ball you cunt,7
They should have sent archer over tewatia,3
SRH & CSK in race to get Tewatia,8
Sarfraz Khan may be our gunda but he takes a lot of catches,6
Tewatia taking inspiration from ex-KXIPer Saha,9
Sandpaper was his second worst mistake as a captain,22
Tewatia is KXIP agent /s,8
Rohan is much better at commentary than his dad tbh,1
Wow guess who has the strike,9
He's just not getting it,4
"I feel Sarfaraz is the only liability in the fielding department, he‚Äôs trying really hard but he‚Äôs just not fit enough",5
FML. Walk off tewatia!,13
Tewatia‚Äôs got smith‚Äôs nudes.,22
my boy bbw Sarfaraz lost some thicnes,8
Whoever send Tewatia is more responsible for this inning. You had Uthappa and never has Tewatia shown any batting skill.,15
This is just cringe to watch. Can they not retire him somehow?,8
Keeping the strike,3
[deleted],12
rahul the wall tewatia,2
KXIP secret agent take a single to keep the strike.,7
"haha, single on last ball of the over.",6
"Ye tewatia ko ‚Çπ100 dunga, out hoja bhai",8
The least Tewatia could do is not take a single off the last ball of the over,12
Genuinely just take him off,8
Tewatia pulling off a dhoni,3
Who was the Idiot in RR to send Tewatia,8
Nice. Tewatia took a single off the last ball,7
In gully cricket Tewatiya would be beaten up and having the bat taken away from him,7
This is where the team Mentor should step in and retire the guy. No shame . It‚Äôs just strategy .,3
Tewatias taking single to take charge in the next over,4
This is getting a little embarrassing for the RR think tank,6
One of the rare moments when the commentators are 100% on point,8
Why keep the strike? Sanju should not have run,5
Imagine you're chasing 223 and one of your team mates decides to pull a 6 (15),9
Hahahahahaha.... Keeps the strike. What an utter chutya! Shit! Can't stop laughing at how incompetent this cunt is.,3
Just please retire out,3
Rahul tewatia common man you can do it young lad,4
Lol r/cricket will melt if Tewati runs out Samson,8
Guys I guarantee Tewatia's more annoyed at himself than you are at him,9
"If I were Tewatia, I would have shoved that bat up my ass and retired hurt myself.",5
"Tewatia, future CSk prospect. Very excited!",8
Neesham OP,3
haha. single of the last ball. perfect tewatia.,2

hmmm...",-1
Samson is losing his focus. Should stick to his strengths.,2
"Who tf sent tewatia at 4 as smith was batting

Smith shud ask archer to black him raw",3
This would have been the perfect situation for someone like Krishnappa Gowtham to come in for RR,3
"50* sixes at Sharjah, in just second game

55 sixes at Abu Dhabi and Dubai combined in 7 games.",7
Tewatia does brilliantly to take a single of the last ball to keep strike,3
I don‚Äôt have a pony in this race but a single on the last ball of the over is the worst thing Tewatia could do.,3
A simple defeat would not have hurt this much.,3
I am not sure why would you send someone who is clearly not in touch in a 223 run chase?,2
Only our 3D boy can understand the tremendous amount of pain Tewatia is in right now,2
Tewatia should start looking for tickets back home not gonna get another match here.,1
THIS IS THE OVER HE'S GONNA EXPLODE,1
Would be cool to watch Sanju Samson bat through,1
"A single, FML",1
Please name the commentators. Never heard this voice before.,1
I have no idea what's going on in Tewatia's mind. Is he playing for team or himself. He should get out for the sake of his team.,2
"If Botham can run out his captain for playing slow, surely Samson can do it for Tewatia?",4
All bowlers padding their economy rate against tewatia,3
He needs to get hit wicket,1
Farming the strike,1
Ok this over a wicket will fall,1
"Match was getting really interesting until twatia turned in. I'm so madd, fuck! 

Someone get twatia some ear plugs now",2
How do you guys refresh to get NEW comments? I have to manually pulldown to refresh. I'm on phone.,2
Who sent Tewatia out? Was it Smith or the coach?,1
Tewatia keeping the strike wtf. This has to be fixed,3
Lol at ppl taking a shot at MS big D even in a RR v KX match thread.,7
Twatia,1
They could've sent Joffra for quick runs,1
Hahahhaahhahahahah keeping the strike,1
"When Thala does it, it's ""NRR calculations"", but when my boi Tewatia does it, it's ""poor batting"". Double standards smh",5
Tewatia can say goodbye to his slot. Lol,1
"Swann just can't control himself looking at the way Tewatia is batting, he's laughing saying he got a single on the last ball",1
My God Tewatia is bad,2
He retains strike lol lol,3
"RR will learn from this and let Jaiswal open, push Smith to 3 and Samson at 4.",2
Tewatia needs to fuck off,2
The thing about having arrogant celebrations is to be good enough for that to not look foolish You are failing Tewatia,3
Can you retire hurt a player in such a situation ?,3
"Don't blame tewatia, blame the one who sent him out to bat. Like, who tf decided that?",5
Who is this guy!!!,2
Tewatia - player of the match from KXIP side,4
Tewatia is a Haryanavi stupid lad who somehow got the biggest stage of IPL. Fraud üòÇüò≠,5
"Imagine tewatia coming down and slogging it only to miss it, but Rahul doesn't stump him. üòÇ",8
At this point tewatia shd just get hitwicket man,3
"My fav aussie is Maxwell - guy is a gun in all departments, too bad Langer doesn't trust him much. I absolutely love him ‚ô•Ô∏èüå±",2
This is hilarious I want Tewatia to stay there till the end for the memes.,4
Make Tewatia great again,3
"once retirement happens for the first time, it will be commonplace in all of t20. just do it!!",5
[deleted],5
I feel this is a call Amol Mazumdar has made. He's a part of their think-tank and was talking about Tewatia's range hitting skills highly before the tourney's start,6
Take a single at the last ball. Good job RR,5
*Imagine for the first time you see an aggressive chase of 200 in this year's IPL. Your top three go out of the skin to bring that RRR down and then an unknown guy wearing pink fucks up entire chase with 15 balls*,8
"Nothing wrong with what Tewatia is doing. See it off till lunch, grab a good feed, and then go big in the middle session.",11
I feel bad for the dude. Under too much pressure now,6
Gavaskar Jr making a lot of sense with the pinch hitter comment,3
Even tewatia is wondering why he was sent after two wickets down,5
This is the most frustrating innings I have ever seen,3
Match winning performance  for Punjab by Tewatia,5
Tewatia definitely has nudes of some RR higher management dude's wife. No other explanation for his promotion to top order,7
Fucking shit,2
Is retire out actually a thing?,5
Tewatia is the Murali Vijay of RR,4
Tewatiya nikal pehli fursat me aur archer ko bhej,3
Tewatia has become a unique case where even the commentators dont want him to take a single of the last ball.,6
I have not even paid for anything but I want my money back,6
Tewatia should be demoted to permanent 12th man.,5
"as a CSK fan, I don't think I could've asked for anything more today",4
"Samson trying to win it for RR, Tewatia trying to protect NRR.",2
"I can't think of a more ridiculously obnoxious innings, maybe Yuvraj in the WT20 final against SL",1
Just hit wicket tewatia. Please.,2
At this point tewatia should do what we do in gully cricket just hit the wicket with his bat.,2
This has to be one of the saddest t20 moments ever... honestly this bloke has just ended his career. Wouldn't be surprised if he isn't here next year,2
This just hurts to watch man!!!!,2
[deleted],1
Seedha khel le pehle,1
Is Tewatia doing his Test cricket audition?,1
Tewatia is the Hetmeyer of batting,2
Neesham is much better than jordan. Jordan is just overhyped because of english pundits,3
Tewatia's looks like that gully cricket cunt. Who can't bat or score run. But takes single at the last ball.,3
"Is there troll bet btw Smith and Warner? Both sending batsman, in crucial situations, who cannot hit to save their lives.",2
"Okay so who do you blame here? The batsman who just can't get going? The captain who made the error with his line-up? Or senior pro Uthappa, who didn't push to bat at #4? Something similar happened to CSK and we know who was blamed.",3
"This is gonna destroy this dudes confidence, why would they send him in he was set up for failure he clearly does not have the skill

Edit: I have been proven wrong",3
Book a shrink for RT,3
Samson‚Äôs hit 25 off 15 in a partnership that‚Äôs 33 off 32,3
"Tewa: I have taken Watsons wicket. Did u see that, I mean did u see that? I will go next, kay?  
Coach: okay, you go next. 

- scenes in RR dugout probably",2
"This tournament is showing time and again that's it's VERY difficult to find a quality number 4 batsman. If India couldn't find a proper number 4 batsman for the World Cup, it's even harder to find 8 number 4 batsmen for the IPL teams.",3
In b4 casuals cry match fixing,2
Are bhai tuj se seethe lag nahi rahe kyoun ulta sidha hokar khel raha,2
"Rahul needs to channel his inner Ravi Shastri and hit the ball like a tracer bullet, make sure all three results are possible, if he wants to win he‚Äôll need to play well, he‚Äôll need to flash and flash hard, take the aerial route, needs to perform in all three departments",2
Which genius sent Tewatia in a record run chase lol,7
Tumse na ho paega Tewatia,3
Get hit-wicket,2
"I think even if tewatia gives a catch , the kxip player will drop it intentionally.",5
Rajasthan need Jofradamus to get a 30 run over.,3
Surely Samson must be thinking of just calling yes and standing there to run him out,3
Guys Tewatia is a spinner. He's not decided to bat at number 4. He's trying to hit but unable to. Cut him some slack,3
Tewatia should be the Man of the Match if KXIP wins this,2
Ravi Bishnoi - Right arm googly,2
Fucking Ishant Sharma would have hit it better,6
Now it's just a ploy to have him out there by KXIP,3
The guy's got zero confidence,6
Jut hit wicket ffs,2
"Even if Tewatia gets out, the next bat is Robin Uthappa. RR are truly fucked",10
At this rate KXIP shouldn't even bother taking his wicket,4
This is what happens when you watch one De Villiers innings and think you can replicate it,6
Tewatia clears 30 yard circle. That is an improvement,5
Twatia after attempting a reverse hit and then adjusting his gloves lmao I'm dying üòÇüòÇ,5
"Tewatia... Don't mean you ill will for I'm only sitting on my fat ass... But just sacrifice your Wicket, dude. You can't do this. It's ok


Edit-- boy was I wrong",10
Atleast I can hit wicket with my bat,6
Punjab has only 1 tactic: Not to get Tewatia out.,4
They should just keep dropping tewatias catches ez win,2
"There‚Äôs 8 wickets left... hit out of the ground or get out. 

Swing motherfucker...",3
17 ball 8 is what u score and get benched,7
"Man, this thread blew off. I remember only some 1k comments halfway through KXIP's innings and now almost 6.5k comments",5
Even sanju is playing for singles,5
Rahul boi it‚Äôs your time now,2
"Tewatia runs down the pitch and misses...

KL lets him come back in.",8
Deciding over,2
"Good ball, Bishnoi",1
There's no way he can play well now. His confidence is already shot. Really not his fault though. Stupid decision and coaching.,3
Man I feel bad for Tewatia. It happens sometimes and it's a lot of pressure,5
**He can't even clear the inner ring**,2
"Go Tiwatia go , go out",3
MOTM for sure is Tewatia! Unbelievable knock given the state of the match.,4
He‚Äôs got the yips,4
[deleted],0
i wonder what RR fans are feeling rn.,1
My eyes hurt watching tewatia,3
Ouch,2
Why the fuck is Samson giving him strike?,3
Worst thing is Yashasvi was dropped for this trash.,5
Lol Jr Gavaskar is funny,3
"jeez tewatia, stop channeling your inner dhoni and get on with it son!",1
Even the commentators are ripping into the guy. I feel so bad for him. Fucckk,3
Poor guy I feel bad for him :(,4
I am getting serious 2014 T20 WC final flashbacks rn. Yuvi playing all those dot balls while Kohli was batting so fluently,3
2014 yuvraj finals PTSD.,9
Wtf is Samson doing? Just run him out!,3
What is even going on,1
He should have lifted that back leg,2
I genuinely think they should send in Archer at this point.,2
"8 off 17 chasing 200.

Building up nicely here..",5
Ohh no I feel bad now,1
His confidence is dead,2
I don't get why being retired isn't a strategy. The batsman can walk back in if needed I assume.,2
"Rajasthan do trust their batting at all.

They fuckin sent tewatia.",3
Would've loved to see Stokes on this pitch/ground,3
Ronald McDonald has to resign,2
Tewatia should just hit his own wickets and walk.,1
At least jump down the ground you idiot,0
Did RR really believe that Tewatia could be a pinch hitter?,3
[deleted],3
Just leave the crease and get stumped.,3
Tewatia should hit his wicket,3
I would have fainted by now,7
RR fans and Tewatia will need therapy after this innings.,3
Even samson slowed down..,2
Come down the track please...,3
Pinch hitters should be sent in with the instructions that if you can't get it going just retire.,2
It's times like these you wish cricket had substitutions.,7
Bruhhhhh,1
Tewatia is so inept lol.,5
He's gonna win Dream 11 Game Changer: Badri,4
"As much as I feel sorry for Tewatia, the comms are right

Time to dance down the pitch and see what happens",7
"Marna saale, naashpite injured kyun nahi ho gaya iss game se pehle",2
Saha is so relieved now.,7
Tewati was sent to prevent an implosion and he did his job.,2
Now Samson trolling Tawatia... keeps giving him the strike...,3
This is just sad,2
Simon Doull wants to send Tewatia to the danger end LMFAO I‚Äôm deadddddd that‚Äôs the ultimate shitpost of all time,1
"Poor Tewatia is gonna cry all night. Feel for him, shitty decision by management.",8
The match is gone... poor Tewatia,1
Im depressed watching this,6
L O R D Tewatia,3
Out hoja madarchod,2
Out hoja bc,1
Ok he is gonna cry now,10
Fuckin step out & get stumped,5
Samson has ~~one~~ two good games every season and that's it,2
I would have just hit the wicket,6
No KL why are you trying to stump him? He's helping you,3
He's got that Robbie spirit,3
Now I feel slightly bad for him. No confidence in his movements at all.,6
Atleast get yourself out Twat,1
dude's a dim wit,2
Tewatia csnt even get himself out. Would you not just run down the track and try for a 6 and get stumped,2
This is past being painful. Its just funny now ü§£,3
"In all seriousness though, Uthappa would have played a perfect partner and would have handed off strike to Samson every ball.",3
Bosdk out ho ja na,3
r/watchpeopledieinside material right here,11
Is this the worst embarrassing batting in the IPL ever?,2
This is really painful,6
Damn! This is the first time I have seen commentators shit on one player soo much,5
GG yo guys. Chase practically over.,2
Ngl if I was him I'm getting out on purpose,5
Hahhahahah Samson laughing at the other end,4
Run urself out man.,2
"Lol Tamil Commentary taking the absolute piss out of Tewatia.

Calling him the Dream11 Game Changer of the Match!!",8
Are you telling me IPL isn't fixed? /s,2
Get stumped out you idiot.,2
Just run yourself out lad,4
Should've ran him out here,4
Tewatia absolutely single handedly lost rr the match,3
Why he is not getting out,4
Seriously man wtf is wrong with you,3
"Feel for Tewatia. He's getting trolled online, which happens all the time, but the commentators are also roasting him",5
Lol.. this has now become a joke. What a disastrous decision by Smith.,5
Rahul not even trying to get him out üòÇ,3
"I blame the team management/coaches for ruining Tewatia today and potentially his career.

Player's careers are ruined when they play with brain dead management.

Poor tewatia will never get away from this (with more than 50% of Indian fans who are harsh as f\*ck and vindictive in nature). Once the hate train starts on a player he can never get away from that tag in India.",9
I feel like crying.,6
This is literally ROFL stuff üòÇü§£üòÇ,2
If not 2 sixes then this is done for sure,5
Feeling bad for him,4
Bishnoi bowling really well too,5
JUST RUN YOURSELF OUT HOLY SHIT,4
I'm not even a rajashthan royals fan and I'm livid,2
"8 (19)

aint stepping out of crease",2
Tewatia is a geniuine gamechanger I see,7
Jesus Christ poor guy,5
"Fucking tewatia, just charge down the pitch and get stumped",3
Oh my.,2
Tewatia should just leave a straight ball,4
They won't even run him out now lmao,6
tewatia should hit wicket at this point he can‚Äôt do anything,5
*why am I still here*,4
"I feel for Tewatia

-- Also Shitting all of the commentary on Poor Tewatia",14
ED should check Tewatia's bank account,5
Rahul why are you trying to stump him? If I were Punjab I‚Äôd keep him in for the rest of the innings.,9
are you kidding me!!,2
LMAO,2
It only took a decade,4
Holy shit.,2
FINALLY!!!,2
Finally,2
Ahhhhh finally,2
Get out mate. Nobody wants you in the middle.,5
FUCKING GET OUT,6
Get ready for Tewatia memes.,6
Finally!!,1
'Deewar'tia,1
What did I just see?!!,2
How many play and miss it takes to realise he is only bowling Google's?,1
If you think Tewatia is number 4 material then you have nothing to complain,9
There you go,1
This is beyond embarrassing. 19 balls 8 runs. This guy can't even connect the bat with the ball.,4
Dhoni Jr.,8
I feel for Tewatia's family man üòû,16
Riyan Parag would have done 10x better than Tewatia. I remember his 50(26?) while chasing last year.,7
Tewatia is unfortunate to have been put into this situation by the RR thinktank.,8
Finally...,1
Tewatia shud me MOTM for Kxip rather than Mayank,3
Yes!!,1
How the fuck that happened,1
FINALLY,3
[deleted],11
Oye WTF,1
"I want tewatias confidence, trying reverse sweep when you cant even middle a proper delivery.",7
Finally he hits one!,6
Never seen the commentators this annoyed at a player lmao,5
This is Tewatia's 14th innings. He averages 18.43 and he strikes at 113. I don't see why we should be so surprised.,9
I am feeling bad for Tewatia now. How will he ever recover from this?,7
India's talent pool is surely amazing,4
tewatia to do dhoni here,4
Someone tell tewatia that punjab and haryana divided long time ago. This haryana lad playing for punjab still,6
"i feel so sorry that we are s*hitting on Tewatia so much.. but come on dude.. just give the strike back to Samson...



i am not proud of this.. 




no wonder his name rhymes with ch*tiya.. coz he is being one, right now..



alright i am gonna head out now..",6
"Game on,bois",1
Atleast Robbie would be run a ball,3
This is just painful to watch now,3
Tewatia doing a Gavaskar here. And by Gavaskar I mean 36 (174),12
Finally,2
SIXXxX,1
I have never seen a player fuck their team over this badly since last Saha in last match.,6
P O G C H A M P,2
Ok I hope RR have a good therapist,4
Tewatia actually has better intent than most of the CSK players.,6
Oh shit he's starting to hit,0
Backing Tewatia to get a dentury here,3
Tewatia said fuck r/cricket,4
Just like Thala would've done.,2
Tewatia redemption arc,0
Is this the same match even? I swear batsmen were just timing the sixes earlier.,1
Woah. He must gave got an orgasm out of it.,1
Smith trying to be too clever sending out Tewatia,0
Redemption arc?,0
Should've really sent Uthappa. His experience could've come handy and possibly take some pressure off of Samson. Tewatia is literally adding more pressure by wasting balls and taking last ball singles. It's understandable if he's under pressure. It happens but he should really consider sacrificing his wicket. I kinda feel bad for him but really should consider sacrificing.,1
He will start smacking now,0
One six won't do anything.,1
Even Samson can't help but laugh at this,3
"dammmnn boiii, I didn't think anyone would've one upped our Lord robbie",3
Absolute scenes when Tewatia gets these,2
Idk but Tewatia kinda sus to me,5
Thank Christ I was feeling so much second hand anxiety watching him. Atleast he has something now,8
Good let‚Äôs all troll Tewatia some more so he can cunt some more shots,6
"90 off 34 


I think it is asking too much now.

Shame, it was a close game",8
That six should shut us up alright!,2
10 more boundaries right now,2
Finally tewatia! What a relief it must be for him.,4
Tewaatia has been playing since 2014 so it is not even nervousness of the stage.,8
"I would have fainted straight on the stumps, if I was tewatia rn",15
Hope he gets some much needed confidence from this.,6
this explains https://imgur.com/a/PuNqqaA,5
if i were Samson i would be frustrated to watch this.,7
Back to normal for him,4
Even the fake crowd is dead at this moment,23
[removed],10
Nothing left in the match now,5
He has to hit a few more of that to redeem himself,8
Tewatia 6 balls 6 sixes incoming,12
Tewatia is just being selfish. There are 7 wickets to follow so there's no extend your stay if you can't hit.,6
"Dont fuckin' switch

You cant even hit the ball in ur natural stance",7
He is so nervous....you can see it in his face,2
Tawatia shuts all his critics...,0
Only Yuvraj singh can understand Tewatiya struggle rn,8
"Tewatia innings is worse than any innings by Csk batsmen.

But the worst thing is every batsman in Csk bats this way for first 10 balls. Atleast it's one or two guys in rr now",4
They need 25+ in this,1
Agent Tewatia,2
Shane Warne would be absolutely mad,3
He finally hit a six,3
Hitting one six doesn't allow you to start shitting again,3
If Dhenier would have done this it would have been called Masterstroke,4
Tewatia could be on for a dentury here,3
So embarrassing,2
Can't play a normal shot. The guy tries to play a reverse sweep. Big brain time,4
Ganju should show some maturity and tell Tewatia what he should do.,4
Don't get him out,4
Tewatia please just get stumped,2
What a stupid decision to send him ahead of Uthappa,4
Tewatia pulling a Dhoni now.,1
Dude it's quite painful to watch him bat and I'm supporting KXIP,4
Anyone know if the cricket rules allow you to retire batsmen?,2
Stop reverse sweeping. You cant hit shit.,4
at this point punjab probably dont want him out lmao,1
"Bruh why would you drop Jaiswal after such a short run. Give him a fair run at least. Even if it's out of position. Uthappa, Parag, and Curran is not a reliable middle order",2
They need a medical miracle to win from here!,1
Parag and TC should be sent ahead of Uthappa,0
Kya Lund player hai,1
This hurts to watch man!!!,1
Definition of deer in the headlights,2
"And/if any of the two get out, please, please do NOT sent Robbie in. Please do not.

Send Joffra.",1
I feel for him but he needs to get out,-1
Bishnoi should stop playing cricket. Letting tewatiya hit him for a six. üòÇ,-3
"Someone should do his celebration now, bwahaha Tewatia..",-1
Tewatia must be feeling awful.. Give him a break already,0
Tweatia Man of the match for KXIP,1
The guy who's struggling with conventional cricket shots wants to be 360¬∞ ABD.,2
It is painful to watch. This must be how it felt watching Sunny's 36 not out in the 1975 world cup.,1
Tewatia tha thevdia,1
Just fuck off man why in the world he is in team,4
STOP üëè TRYING üëè TO üëè REVERSE üëè SWEEP,9
These guys get an ipl contract for what! And then there is manoj tiwari,1
"I like to plug in my earplugs listening to this commentary, close my eyes, and play back Dhoni's tuk-tuk innings a few nights back",3
I want them to speak with Tewatia in the post match presentation,0
Literally all he's trying to do is reverse sweep and slog. His childhood coach gonna be giving him a call pretty soon..,2
Almost felt bad for him and then he tries to reverse sweep again smh.,5
Tewatia Greater than 50 SR Klaxon,1
0.5 dhoni,1
Blame RR management not Tewatia dude is a bowler,-1
Tewatia XII man for the Kings,-1
Why the reverse?,0
Rajsthan got no one to blame here other than themselves. What were the management thinking when sending in tewatia.,0
"What's he doing? He's just hit one straight down the ground, and then this ugly reverse sweep...smh",0
check SS call records - I bet you will find MSD in call log,0
Rrr 17 boys see u tom,1
Brilliant comeback from bishnoi. Not bad figures on this wicket for a spinner.,1
If I was a RR fan I would have started a petition for banning Tewatia from playing cricket ever again.,1
Yes samson,1
"Scenes if Tewatia goes 50 off 20 from here on. 

Or scenes if he scores 20 off 50 üòØ",3
OH LORD MAXI IS GONNA GET KILLED,1
I feel bad for him.....he should not have been promoted up the order,1
Tewatia will play slow now done too much need restüòÇüòÇ,1
Samson is just superhuman. Wow,3
*from tomorrow I am goin to be extremely kind and generous to every human and animal I see*,7
Aw man kinda feel bad for tewatia. He's trying but it's clearly not enough:(,3
"Tewatia is taking this home, brilliant 6!",5
Now I am sure KXIP doesn‚Äôt want Tewatia out.,1
What happened in his last match ?,2
I feel bad fo tewatia..this dude can bat ..but unfortunately not  a batsmen for this level of competition,7
KP must be gauging his eyes out,2
Tewatia for MotM,2
3D Shankar must be relating hard to Tewatia right now. He must be getting flashbacks of Nagin Trophy Final.,2
I am getting Yuvraj in WT20 final vibes,2
I would have got hit wicket out of shame at this stage,3
Samson just looks so in control. Absolutely quality,2
C'mon samson this is the over,2
YES TEWATIA! ROOTING FOR YOU MATE,2
Samson getting century would be a consolation atleast,2
"What the fuck is Sanju on, like really WHAT THE FUCK",2
"Bro try to hit from the left side first, before trying to hit it from the right side.",1
Tamizh folks... What's tewadiya?,5
Ye andar ki baat hai...Tewatia Kings XI ke sath hai,2
Pant needs to go Samsun is better,4
"Samson and Smith batted perfectly well for this chase, just didn‚Äôt have anyone else",2
"Why not just get stumped? What goes into someone's mind when they're playing like that? 

And what the fuck about ""feel for Tewatia?"". No one feels for me when I fuck up at my job, and I don't get paid crores for 6 weeks of work",6
'sit-up and take notice',2
This guy was doing all sorts of antics on the field against CSK. Plugging his ears and jumping around. All that shit. Life has a way of catching up to you.,6
Does the PharmEasy ad make anyone else irrationally angry because the lyrics of the actual song go ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need a pharmacy‚Äù,1
Somewhere Vijay Shankar is rubbing one out to Tewatia's innings,3
Tewatia's strike rate is destroyed by that six,3
Who is the RR coach ?,3
Sanju üíã,2
Sanju lets go 6x6,3
[deleted],5
Sanju givin it to maxi,2
Not this over,2
"Rahul choking harder than Mia Khalifa rn, god he probably gives good head",3
This is 25 plus over,3
6 ball 6 sixes please.,5
Sanju Damnson,5
SANJU SAMSON!!!,2
Shouldn't have given another over to maxi,2
Damn son,1
Even more frustrating when Sanju is smashing 6s with no effort,7
Samson has reached radioactive stage.,3
Six sixes in an over. Come on samson baby,8
"""Mom can we have a pinch hitter?""  
""We have a pinch hitter at home""  
  
The pinch hitter at home--",13
weirdest match I have seen recently. So awkward.,7
Common samson this is the bonus over,2
D A M N S O N,6
Sanju Damnson!,8
How is he not playing consistently for india,5
He needs to face every ball from here,2
"Jfc don't overdo it mate

Samson makes you take notice once or twice in an ipl season

Commentators acting as if Samson scores 100 every game every year",3
"On one end we have Sanju Samson effortlessly hitting those big sixers and on the other...



Cicada noises",10
Good thing for him is that no one‚Äôs gonna remember this innings in a year or two.,3
MAXWELL WHOOOO,6
Man of the match isn't Agarwal. It's McDonald who decided to send Tewatia in.,7
Sanju you are something else,14
I feel for Samson.,7
"If Sanju somehow manages to bring RR home, this has to be one of the best innings of IPL",8
Tewatia must have done something exceptional in nets to be sent before Robin and Riyan Parag,3
Lol what‚Äôs up with the reverse sweeps from Tewatia when he can‚Äôt even hit normal shots,10
Six 6's loading?,0
Tewatia should be charged with slow batting rate,6
Oh fuck I'm scared,4
There's always a player in gully cricket whom we use to waste balls. That guy grew up and became tewatia,4
I want RR dressing room scenes video after this innings. I'll pay 10 days of my salary,13
"Samson - Me playing EA Cricket 07

Tewatia - Me playing cricket IRL",26
Samson is such a braveheart. Hope he wins it for his team.,10
IN THAA SLUT,1
Samson stole all Tewatia's runs,5
You can get retired hurt by yourself. Just dance down the track every ball or get hit-wicket. No need to alter the rules.,1
Damnson,2
Tewatia just try to come down and slog. Playing as a proper batsman for fuck,1
"My god Samson, guy is killing it",2
Look at how the bloke at the other end is playing! Coulda been a legendary match!!,1
"If Samson doesn't get a limited overs call up after this, I don't know what will.",4
"if u think tewatia is bad, wait till our  Lord robbie comes out to bat",1
RR should have sent proper batsman on this heavenly pitch.,2
"Tewatia should have scored ~25 more runs in those deliveries, no matter how much he hits now those are some valuable runs lost",2
God dammed. Sanju Samson is playing on different pitch altogether with ponting's 2003 world cup final bat.,6
Keep hitting sixes till you win please,2
Bowling Maxwell to Sanju is as braindead as sending in Tewatia at 4,4
Jeez. Wonder what would have happened had they not sent Tiwatia,5
"CSK interested in this Tewatia lad, multi-year contract insights",9
This will not help Maxwell's mental health.,2
"Sad part of this match is that for every six Samson hits, it is negated by Tewatia",4
Samson has done enough in this ipl to be in my india 11 team.,3
Samson finally got the strike,2
"I made popcorn for a grandstand finish to this match. Tewatia came out and said ""Well fuck your popcorn"".",7
Samson fighting a lone fight out there.,4
What sort of cirque-du-Soleil does Rohan Gavaskar think RR is...'put a shoulder around tewatia...',0
"If Tewatia had scored even a normal 30 of 20, this might have been feasible",7
Oof this is like watching faf and dhoni again,7
Bishnoi got him on strike twice and then ended his career,1
Sanju ‚ÄúChris Gayle‚Äù Samson,10
"Swing zara, swing zara",2
are you even allowed to get retired out?,2
Robin utthapa in form would have won RR the match,3
Six Six Want another,3
I want to know who's decision it was to send tewatia,4
4 more to go,2
Could have killed the chase here by bringing Shami. Rahul still noob Captain,4

Dhoni 8(21) flashbacks,4

Sanju really didn't run. Man that's awesome,8
Oh my that should hurt tewatia,6
Good decision Samson,4
They not even running now lmao,6
Sanju 6 sixes please.,3
Lmao sanju turning down a single,7
Tewatia needs to hit 3 sixes in a row to cover up,3
"well done, sanju.",7
Lol didn't take that single.,3
Lmao Sanju Samson didn't run there. Jeez the disrespect to tewatia,6
Ultimate Disrespect from Samson,2
It‚Äôs a pretty astonishingly bad innings to have that many dot balls at this point given the game situation,4
Lmfao Samson not giving strike to Twatia,7

Samson telling Tewatia to fuck off.,11

Samson treating Tewatia as a tailender now lmao,10
LMAO BEST,2
Samson is not running!!!!!!,5
And Sanju won‚Äôt run. Lol,6
Turned down for what,10
Sanju needs to farm strike if RR want to have an even outside chance,4
"FARMING THE STRIKE WITH A NUMBER 4

THIS IS BEYOND RCB LEVEL",18
He's not running.,3
Tewatia: Atleast I stitched a partnership of 50+ with Samson,6
Refusing a single. Like a tailender.,9
Oh Ganju playing like it's death over. Not giving him strike.,2
Samson just trolling now.,8
Oml not even running. I‚Äôd just give up if I was Tawatia,7
Lol he's not running!,5
Dhoniesque,1
Poor Samson can't even get singles due to having to stay on strike,9
"Sanju 'Fine, I'll do it myself' Samson",8
Samson treating Tewatia like a tail lmao,11
Samson playing like he be playing with a tail ender,11
HAHA he refused the run,9
Samson farming the strike...lmao,6
"Samson not giving him the strike, good",2
Thank you for not taking a single. You are smart Sanju.,9
"Samson 76 off 37

RR needs 78 off 29",5
Sanju denying single with 4 and a half overs to go.. That clearly speaks,10
Single rejected nice!!,5
Feelings Sanju bro,2
Haha no single,3
He is refusing singles!!,3
Suggestions for r/cricket names for tewatia as twat and samson as damnson?,7
samson straight up said no to a no. 4 batsman üòÇ,13
"Samson poor guy, has to do everything",7
LMAO,2
Take a bow Sanju. He did get a let off but he's still going with all he's got. Gonna try and get Maxwell away for maximum,7
Still better than the infamous 8(22),5
"Lol samson no single, good decision",6
Tale of Tewatia the tailender,3
"He is denying the single now. Bit harsh, but needed",9

"This is the most beijatti ever done for batsman who came at number 4 , Sanju Samson is trolling",10
"Samson just plainly refusing single in 15 th over . Damn . 

That must be embarrassing for Tewatia",9

Give Samson the Samsung sponsorship you cowards.,8
Stokes and Miller in for Archer and Curran and just aim to score 300 every time.,6
Fuckin hell man,8
Ganju is like watch me chase this down üí™,7
Why would you give 16th over to Maxwell this is like Dube bowling 20th over,11
Farming strike with 2 wickets down must be a first time in IPL history.,14
64 off 25 in this ground is chaseable,7
3rd over was always a big gamble!,6
Samson for India,13
Here is your 20 run over,9
Come on Sanju!!,6
taking a single on last ball *Typical gully cricket*,10
Tewatia tearing up right now.,11
Add 16 more to the total... Make 30 off 20 for Twatia and you have a game.,4

"great players make me feel ""hey i can do that too""",9
Defo never seen a batsmen go fuck it I'll do it myself only 2 wickets down,34
Shouldn't have given Maxwell this over. It was obvious Samson was gonna go this over.,4
Samson and Delilah!,4
what a fucking over,5
Please don't give him strike,6
Just imagine if Sanju had some help from other end in this run chase.,14
"tewatia, you are welcome - samson",11
Samson on literal God mode.,12
Man shouldn‚Äôt have sent Maxi against Samson.,6
"Samson, you beauty... Sixes on demand",13
Holy shit this match tho,9
wtf why not just retire him out if you‚Äôre gonna farm strike?,16
I want to know who's decision it was to send tewatia,23
Probably shouldn‚Äôt have bowled Maxi. Well played by Samson,9
royals dont deserve sanju,7
Single off last ball. Finally some sense,5
"Can‚Äôt blame Samson for saying no to the single, Tewatia is not only putting more pressure on Samson, he‚Äôs destroying his flow",25
"Bad form
OR Sharjah shenanigans?",3
Samson take a bow,5
"Maxwell to Sunil Narine, anyone remember that? (International game)",5
"Lol, why even keep Uthappa in the squad when u don't even have the confidence to send him over Tewatia?",7
Tewatia should retire after that. That's a smack on the face.,7
Its like they are using the Pitch Reversal Technology^TM while poor Tewatia is batting,2
RR can still win,2
Shoulda bowled Murugan ffs,5
If only we would have given Samson as many chances as we gave Fatboy Pant!!,4
Sanju:Fine I'll do it myself,7
Imagine if those 21 balls were played by Samson,5
63 off the final four can they do it?,4
What's Samson like at 50 over cricket ?,3
Chad Sanju,1
Pure Match ki maa chod di (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª),4
"If Samson is not in the flight to Australia, Koach has got stones in his skull.",10
Samson you absolute weapon,2
Should the long off fielder have let it go to the boundary and keep Tewatia on strike next over?,2
Lmao he ain't giving tewatia strike,2
Just one of those days for Tewatia. Braindead management to put him in this situation.,2
Single on last... Gawd it must be killing tewatia,3
"Yeah Maxi, shout nah!",2
Sanju i love you,1
This is like playing with a tailender on day 5,2
"Samson gets 50+ runs in 2 back to back innings:

r/cricket : wait that's illegal",5
That single to end the over üòÇüòÇüòÇ,6
Sanju is playing really smartly right now,1
RR need 60 odd from 4 overs. If Tewatiya hadn't eaten up 21 balls this would have been so close,3
Maxwell's economy went from 4 to 10 real quick there.,3
Shit decision..will cost RR the match!!,0
This is more like it,1
Tewatia - the official non-striker batsman from now on.. Run tewatia run!!!,5
Samson > Pant. Why did we waste time on that waste of time?,1
Time to retire him out. Get Uthappa in ffs...this doesnt make sense.,2
At this point the only person who feels worse than Tewatia would be the one who suggested promoting him ahead of the other batsmen,8
Lowkey team management clapping,3
Man... Feel for Tewatia. How bad would he be feeling now..,10
"Samson has always been special but he has been really inconsistent in the past, would love to see how he plays the rest of the season",6
Chad Tewatia taking it deep and virgin r/Cricket too dense to understand the gameplan,6
[deleted],5
fugging hell sanju is a gem,3
Last ball Samson was like taking single is better than hitting boundary,3
"This is what the chad move by KXIP was, instead of the usual Nair or Sarfaraz they sent Maxwell to avoid this Tewatia type momentum blow",6
"Punjab deserves to loose

Giving maxy the 16th over is as shit as promoting tewatia at 4",1
Theory: Tewatia is actually a right handed batsman. He is being made to play with his left hand by the lefti illuminati.,13
"If you ever feel useless, think of Tewatia when Samson refused that single.",4
"Samson be like fuck pleasantries.

Im gonna keep it real here.",6
Why didn't Murugan Ashwin bowl? Is he injured or something,6
Can't the dude just declare himself hurt and retire?,1
Maxi takes off mask... It's KOACH!!!,9
I know it's sad for Tewatia but at the same time this has been hilarious in a cruel twisted way,4
"I don't particularly hate Tewatia, but if you are in such a bad spot I would've either got myself out by hit wicket or retire hurt. There is no point swinging your bat if your missing.",3
I hope tewatia doesn't do further damage atleast,2
Good to see varun aaron on the bench.,2
Samson finally realizing Punjab will not be getting Tawatia out!,3
This is without a crowd. If there was crowd tewatia would have been pelted with stones,6
"If Tewatia made only 15 more runs, it would have been 48 off 24. Basically just make 29 off 21 balls.",7
Samson deserves an apology from BCCI for ditching him so many legit chances...,5
It would‚Äôve probably been 43(24) if someone else came in place of Tewatia,2
Shami's going bald,5
I feel so sorry for Samson. The required run rate was already too much and it was further shot up Tewatia.,3
"This tewatia move by smith and co, beats Rohit‚Äôs Vijay Shankar move in the Nidhas trophy",3
"Samson not just knocking the door of team India, he is burning the house down",17
"Samson seems like a good prospect, why we play Pant over him??",7
Bishnoi got Sanju on strike for Maxi as revenge for Maxi shouting at him.,7
Tewatia could get a kidney stone and get shot in the leg and it would still hurt less than Samson turning him down,6
Incoming tewatiya resurrection. Would love it,4
Farming strike with 8 wickets remaining. Lol,4
One more big over and you just might see the heist of the century,3
Gone,1
This has fucked both Tewatia and Uttapa's morale,4
Shit,1
Jeez. RR camp is still under illusion that the target is 180. That explains reason for sending Tiwatia,9
shit man. that's sadüò≠,1
Game over,2
Fuck,2
Oh no,2
Oh Nooooooooooo,2
Damn,1
gg Sanju,3
Well then,2
I get the feeling RR middle order is even more shit than ours.,9
Fucking hell sanju. That was lazy,7
That was Tewatia‚Äôs wicket.,4
2nd innings Shami strikes!,2
Fuck no Samson,2
Fuck well played though lad,2
Eat shit RR,3
Oof. Samson gone.,2
Send jofra,3
bowling a part timer so late when he had neesham or Ashwin was a big mistake. But RR is well behind despite that over. Let us see how Shami/Cotrell does.,2
2nd innings Shami,2
BRINN ARCHER PLSSSSS,1
Good Night RR,3
Match over lol,3
shami üî•,1
Soft dismissal after a good innings,2
SRH fans you see what an actual shit middle order looks like ? Look at Sanju struggling...,6
"okay, it's been nice till it lasted boiiss",6
Shami!,1
Good night guys...nice game,3
Send in Archer,2
ARCHER COME ON,3
Samson thank you for your service,7
That took the air out of this chase. Samson üëèüëèüëèüëè,3
Shami is so fucking OP these days. Must be the milk.,12
game over,1
Not Tewatia's fault that a player in the Sunil Narine mould was sent at 4. He can swing bit he's not a batsman,3
Hope this is a breakthrough IPL for Sanju. India needs power hitters like him in the top order.,3
Oh no shami show mercy,2
Hell yeahhhh,1
My man deserved that century,7
"What a shame!!

Game was just heating up.",4
"Anyone who's bitching about sanju not being in the indian team, this is the first time he has gotten two 50+ consecutive scores. I hope that stat tells you guys something",21
"Well played , too much pressure",7
Gone. Pressure killed Samson,4
Such an anticlimax. We'll played Samson.,4
Over now,1
it looks so wet out there,1
SEND JOFRA IN,3
"Sanju's back to back 50, well that's 2020 for you folks!",6
"Samson is playing like the old dhoni, denying singles to no 4 and tewatia is playing like the current dhoni",16
Tewatia lost Rajasthan the match,5
"Tewatia's soul has died inside guys, there nothing left there, just a void now",12
Chad Sanju vs Virgin Tewatia,9
This is very poor from Tewatia,4
Don't fuck with shami. Fuck you tewatia,7
SHAMIIIIIIIII,6
Shami what a fucking daddy hell yeah,3
They badly need Stokesy,5
Shami you beauty,5
Game set match KXP. Bye Bye Samson.,7
As long as Tewatia is out there they have a chance. Real young prospect,11
"Ah shit, this is on you tewatia",2
Shami you beauty,4
Shami ends one and a half hour struggle,5
F,2
"Mohammed ""second innings"" shami",7
Sanju played his part. Take a bow champ,10
Well done Tewatia !! Sucked out Sanju‚Äôs momentum!,11
[removed],0
Shami bags the match.,6
Alright boys bye,2
Shane Warne is destroying his room,8
Haha. That was funny,3
"If this was an ODI, Tewatia's house was definitely going to get attacked",11
Classic innings from sanju,3
Salutes in the chat bois,5
Samson getting out before Twatia. Lololol,8
Thats the game,4
I feel so sad man.,2
"Game over for RR, their set batsmen's gone",1
Send Curran pls,2
Second Innings Shami !,6
Tewatia has costed them the match. Even Archer or Curran would have been a better choice for pinch-hitting.,12
Dhoni jerking off to the thought of Uthappa and Tewatia together,28
Tewatia to lead the charge from here,10
Joffradamus will save the day or not.,4
Gg,3
"I don't blame him, had to do it . Good knock Sanju",6
Awww,2
It's all on Tawatias tiny shoulders now...,3
And guys that's the end of the match.,7
No Graeme don‚Äôt give us hope thanks,2
Samson's gone what will they do now,4
Poor Samson,3
Such an anti-climatic dismissal. But such a beautiful innings. Played really well,8
Twatia gonna win it from here and do a Hulk Hogan celebration.,5
Inb4 Tewatia gonna win it for RR,3
"Man did his job , Man departs 




Salute !",8
Scenes if Tewatia wins it for RR now. Who am I kidding though.. haha,6
Shami hero aada hero,2
That's it. Game over. RR would have had a genuine chance without the fucker tewatia. Please dont send Robbie now,3
Tewatia once ate 22 gol gappe.,3
Thank you Tewatia.,1
Brace youselves for jaydev unadkat,4
Jonty fan girling is so cute,6
We need ARCHER now,3
Rajasthan team management was the imposter all the time.,3
Shami bamboozled Samson. Well played! Majestic stroke play.,2
Robin Uttahapa and Tewatia. What a combination. *Jinx*,6
It would be full on flip if Tewatia win this for us,1
Take a bow indeed Samson! Hope he gets picked over Pant for India and remains consistent,10
Tfw Tewatia takes over and wins it from here,4
How good are his short balls man,3
Tewatia gonna hit 6 6s and bring RR home,3
Scenes when they dont send in Archer,2
Tewatia ke batting ki CBI jaanch honi chahiye.,1
"**16.1** Mohammed Shami to Samson, OUT, oh heartbreaking. Samson has perished. **161-3**

SV Samson c &dagger;Rahul b Mohammed Shami 85 (42b 4x4 7x6) SR: 202.38",1
Cmon send jofra not Robin *rolls eyes*,2
Tewatia with Uthappa.....time to go to sleep,2
"unfortunately no hole is deep enough for Tewatia to hide in today..

i swear this is my last s*it post on him today..",3
"Just gotta say I never thought I‚Äôd see the day when a number 3 refuses a single to retain strike from a number 4 with 4 overs to go and everyone, including the commentators, are like ‚Äúyea fair enough actually‚Äù",12
Well played Samson!,4
In the next 10 matches in Sharjah. No ones gonna choose chasing.,3
Tewatia will fight right in the CSK team tbh,6
[deleted],3
Its archer time,2
Chalo RR ko Vannakkam,2
Useless stat: Murali Vijay and kedhar Jadav are the only players not to hit a six in this stadium who faced atleast 10 deliveries.,9
Samson and mayank new found respect for both of these giving challenge to regular squad members,3
It should have been 50 from 4 overs,3
Game over. Good Night.,2
A young lad barely having any international experience made the entire team doubt whether 232 in T20 was sufficient. Take a bow Mr Samsom!,10
"Come on Tewatia, it's your time to shine",3
Samson poor guy. That's on the guy who sent tewatia,6
ARCHER PLEASE,2
Tewatia gunna pull off a redemption arc here. Only sixes from now on,5
:(,1
My stream is slower than u/CricketMatchBot,5
"Tewatia is an idiot sure, but this is on the whoever sent him in at 4.",5
Can they call him back if they make sure Tewatia retires after that.,4
Deserved a hundred,2
Cmon robbie? Ffs really?,2
175 max from here,1
Let's do it Tewatia,2
Fantastic knock. Assume even 35-38 off Tewatia's 21 balls faced and this would be a 50-50 match,1
"Is it illegal if the fielding side let a single go for a boundary to bring Tewatia on strike? 

If I were in KXI I‚Äôd be trying every dirty tactic.

Edit: FUCK!",0
"What a shame.

On the bright side, we get to see Lord Tewatia vs Lord Uthappa",2
And now there are 2 Tewatias,2
Maybe now I understand what CSK fans are going through,5
Time for double shithousery now xd,1
Can't feel too bad about the guy given his mindless celebrations after taking a wicket,4
"Props for Samson, he fought well :)",3
Put fucking archer or Curran in jeez,4
This has got to be one of the best innings in a losing cause (assuming kxip would win here on),3
Time for KXIP bowlers to statpad now,2
"Shami.... gets ignored but honestly I think he‚Äôs one of the most gun bowlers in the world right now, based on form (and fitness)",3
"Lets go Robbie, 2s every ball",2
Ahh the scenes if Uthappa starts tonking now,3
Twatia u cunt,3
Samson . What a inning dude . Take a bow,2
Game perfectly set up for Archer,3
And now for the Tewatia Chutia....,3
2 Robbies on the crease now.,3
Chad Robbie wanted to runout tewatia first ball,5
"Lmao, Uthappa comes in. Goes for a clean grounded hit for a single",3
Why no Archer,2
"This game will rest in peace in the t20 graveyard. 

What could have been a legendary match turned into a cricketing lesson for teams everywhere: batsmen bat, bowlers bowl.",5
"Lmao Uthappa was trying to run him out, but Tewatia said noo",3
Everybody in the RR think tank should apologize to Samson.,3
Shami reminded me of Kane's last over wicket,3
"India needs someone who can start striking from 1st ball, Samson should be a shoe in the middle/lower order",7
they should've sent in Archer,3
Tewatia will pull a Dhoni where he will hit 2 sixes and claim he has a 100+ sr,5
Well done macha Sanju. Shame you had no support from Tewatia,3
Why tf was a bowler sent out for a 200+ run chase? I'm so confused. Do you not want to win?,5
"Does RR have the shittiest batting lineup?

Literally nobody after Smith Buttler Samson.

E: Tewatia stands vindicated.",5
[deleted],5
"Lol Uthappa and Tewatia forget nrr now 

Ps I hope this riles him up",2
Scenes if tewatia wins it from here,7
Now fucking send Archer not Uthappa,3
"Samson is such a champ.


And what a fitting end to it, only a champion like Shami could've done it and he delivered.


And now I dont feel like watching this game anymore.",6
Now tewatia will deny singles,9
All players in middle are of Punjab,3
How much have the comms practiced saying Tewatia?,3
F,2
Tewatia and uthappa death batting. This is going to be fun. I predict a final score of 170,11
Tewatia could have at least been 30 from 21 and the chase would have looked easier.,6
Should have sent Archer,5
"Should have sent Jofra, RR management is on drugs",7
"even that one single looked so \* b u s y \*, something tewatia hasn't shown at all",3
What happened to Utthappa walking down the track while the bowler runs up to bowl?,1
Second innings Shami strikes,3
"Another young prospect in Uthappa, cannot wait to see the waves this guy makes in the international scene",6
Uthappa looks way too old to be playing,4
If tewatia wins it from here...r/cricket will die from shame...,14
"LMAO Uthappa came in 

Gg Rajasthan",5
*Robin and TEWATIA on strike. Pls don't question why they didn't even play for NRR now*,3
Mate I would rather have RCB choke and get out for 100 than this,3
"Ofcourse tewatia wants the strike, he needs to hit 4 6s",7
Dream 11 team dedo koi lol,1
Looks like Tewatia will be the MOM for KXIP,11
This is so fucking painful to watch,3
Quite bold of Tewatia to deny the second.,8
Really utthapah you want to win Rajasthan,6
tewatia's 14(21) did more to change the course of this match than Samson n mayank's innings combined,25
**Operation N R R begins**,11
How Not to Chase for Dummies,14
Wait for Uthappa to do a Nidhas trophy DK,8
"Lord Uthappa, Lord Curran, Lord Jofra...

Just hit the ball, no tuk tuk please",3
"Well done guys. Smith was browsing r/cricket and decided to send Tewatia. Now the match is ruined

Edit 8D underwater chess by Smith.",11
Abe full toss toh maar,2
Sanju Samson is an absolute danger-man and *needs* to be in India‚Äôs T20I team atleast,9
"Dugout guys have no mercy for Tewatia , I like it.",8
"Gotta feel for Samson, played one of the better innings of his career. Let down by his partner.",4
"Well, that's the game boys. Lovely effort, Sanju.",6
Tewatia would hit 3 sixes of Shami now.,3
"Tewatia for India no 4

In Tests",3
Who is waiting for Utappas running six,6
Bc archer ko bhejo,2
RR and SRH showing off their TAILDEEP lineup,8
"Lmao still sending uthappa

Not archer

Lol RR thinktank",8
Don't know why Smith got it wrong....,1
Tewatia to take Kohli's spot at 4 for the Aus tests,6
Telling that they'd send Tewatia ahead of Uthappa.,1
Petition to get the boundary up to the 30 yard circle for Tewatia.,9
"Imagine if both these guys go insane out of the blue and win the match themselves lmao.

But well, only one can dream",16
These are the kinds of events after which Tewatia does a press conference with Smith besides him and says 'I take full responsibility',7
WHAT A JOKE,1
"Tewatia's celebration last match was cringe but this is a very big punishment lol

Aur bhai Aa Gaya swad?",10
Sarfraz needs to chill lmao,4
Oh ffs... Tewatia should have taken 2,3
Honestly can't even get himself out,3
"Sanju, thanks for making it interesting mate üôè",7
Tewatia on strike!! This is why we watch IPL,3
What batting display today wow!,1
tewatia's gonna pull off a dhoni and reduce the victory margin to 20 runs,9
inb4 tewatia goes bezerk and wins the game with a 6 off the last ball.,9
Techutiya motm for punjab,0
Nominations for the worst five innings of the IPL so far?,3
I just hope RR doesn't drop Tewatia for the next match,5
Tewatia is gonna kill Smith for letting him bat after this innings,2
KXIP will do WHATEVER they can to not get the wicket of Tewatia,4
"If Tewatia really wanted to chase this for RR, he would have been out hit wicket 10 balls ago.",3
"If there is still a Nayi Soch award, it has to go to KXIP for not getting Tewatia out",4
Oh my god he‚Äôs still on strike,5
Only if Tewatia had atleast gone at a striker rate of 150. The pressure wouldn't have gone up so much,2
"Keeps Tewatia on strike, lmao",5
"I'm not saying I support it, but I would understand if Samson started beating the shit out of Tewatia after this match",10
These two are some of the worst at hitting the long ball and they have to bat together in a chase like this. Smh.,5
man he played a full character role instead of a cameo.,4
Why did they not send Jofra?,2
Tewatia going for MAXIMUM NRR,8
Hey already our move to promote Tewatia has backfired so let's send Uthappa(who is fresh off a horrow show last match) IN. Makes total sense.,4
"Tewatia must have been a good hitter in the nets, so they sent him. But point to learn from this is fuck this pinch hitter shit. Send in proper batsmen, always.",7
Showed just one shot of kohli and for MI all shots were of Rohit.,1
Shami please be at your best in Australia test series,6
If RR are chasing 100 on a shit pitch they should send Tewatia in,3
HOLYSHIT!? I THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO PLAY SAHA AT 4 FOR SRH. BUT THESE PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR MINDS BY SENDING IN UTHAPPA,8
Rajasthan aren't going to pick tewatia ever again,3
Samson has brought a bulldozer to this IPL and he will fuck shit up to get into that India dressing room.,5
Its like 2 tailenders are batting. Why not send Curran?,3
"At this point, Punjab would be smart to not take catches or run out chances if it‚Äôs Tewatia",4
"True Words -> 

Arun: ""Hey stop blaming Tewatia! There are more Tewatias in real life than Samsons. ""

But FK u. Tewatia",9
"Tewatia asking umpire, ""Where's the ball?""",7
They should‚Äôve sent archer instead of robbie,6
"If Tewatia wins this for us, we will build a statue of him in front of statue circle.",9
He gave a header into the boundary,3
The comms are roasting Tewatia every chance they get,6
That 'chal chal chal chal chal' was the equivalent of get the fuck out of there if ever there was one.,4
Robbie's eyes look like he's given up on life tbh,10
What happened there?,1
[deleted],14
"Hateship ended with Unadkat, Tewatiya is the hated one now.",17
Get this Tewatia out BC.,7
"Slats is right. You want a cameo, you send Archer and not someone who can barely clear the 30m circle",11
Making odi out of t20,3
Lmao did he just get slapped by the ball and then it went to the boundary,9
"I don't think I've seen anything as sad as this in a t20 match ever. Honesty mournful, RIP",12
Lol love this.... tewatia is like wtf why are you making me run?,10
[deleted],4
"**7 or 7+ 6s in an IPL Innings**

Gayle - 14 times

ABD - 5 times

Russell - 4 times

Pant - 4 times

Samson - 4 times",11
Tewatiya must have bamboozled Warne with deep fake Tiktok videos to be sent as a pinch hitter,4
Sending tewatia at 4 was a badder move than selecting vijay over rayudu for wc,12
What a gun header,3
KP the voice of reason,3
Commentary people are being politically correct,8
Where is Jofra ffs,4
I agree with commentators until they talk about sending Uthappa,8
"Uthappa would have rotated strike at least,  would have put a lot less pressure on Samson",13
If Tewatia and Utthappa remains not out then RR score would be 190,3
Why no one's Trying Yorkers ??,1
Hold on! Wasn't Warnie supposed to be with RR?,2
Signature Uthappa,3
Uttappa will win the match for RR.,2
My guilty pleasure is watching these BIG BRAIN gambles backfire spectacularly,16
Would they send twatia if they were batting first? Hell no. Then why would you send him now?? That's shooting yourself in the foot with extra steps.,6
this is the greatest struggle I have ever seen after India's independence struggle,12
Game still on bois. 30run Archer incoming,3
This is vintage Uttapa,11
Robbie üëç,6
Robbie ? Is that you ?,11
im so angry at their shitass decisions that i am now rooting for rr to be bottom of the table. complete shitsandwich.,7
Scenes if these two win the match for RR,5
UTTHAPA.,7
RR still have a chance IMO. Tewatia should somehow get 20 this over,3
Uthappa shutting people's mouths,7
When you score slower than Uthappa,4
51 of 3 is possible!!,7
Um guys I guess Uthappa might win it for RR after all,3
If only RR management sent Uthappa over Tewatia,9
Fuck me Robbie!! Where the fuck were you all along??!,5
As I said Robbie won't be uglier than tewatia,5
"Archer would have done better than tewatia, warne used to praise him like anything for his allround skills ..wonder why they didn't think of sending him up",9
Ugh,4
Shami is the best subcontinent pacer... Don‚Äôt @ me,10
"If Uthappa can play then everyone should play,it's super batting pitch",8
Robin  fuck you Smith uthaappa,11
"Ohhhh man, why wasn‚Äôt Uthappa sent in earlier. Dang",6
The decision to send Tewatia earlier looks more worse & worse after each delivery.,6
Drop Uttapa and Tewatia in the middle of the match.,2
Okayy looks like sending Uthappa ahead of Tewatia would've changed everything,11
They just need one 22-23 run over.,8
Uthappa showing the management how much they've fucked up,6
Tewatia in test mode,3
Going back to the hotel isn't gonna be safe for Tewatia,3
Wtf was that shot,4
Uthappa to Tewatia - Give me the strike fuckwit.,6
this match could well be Uthappas redemption!,2
"Tewatiya has generated a lot of hate towards himself and he has himself to blame , he fucked up RR momentum and lost them the match. We are correct to blame him for match.",8
"My handjob offer also holds for Uthappa, btw",2
I mean sandpaper was bad but sending Tewatia in over Uthappa was a bigger crime honestly,9
Tewatia‚Äôs innings the difference between both the teams.,7
Ashwins header > van persies header,3
51 from 3. Need a Russell like innings,5
Both Rahuls contributed towards punjabs victory here.,6
Robbie for the win,1
Uthappa himself played Tewatiaesque innings last year for KKR.,3
Tewatia 36-run over coming right now...,6
The worst part is even if Tewatia gets out now it's too late,3
Love the intent shown in this chase. Argh i hope it goes to the last over.,2
"Uthappa should run Tewatia out, will do his team a massive help.",3
Think this is not over yet!,2
"Imagine not sending this guy in..
RR were cruising",2
Great. But now Uthappa's off strike and it may be a challenge to get him back there.,1
RR need Uthappa of 2007 series against Eng in Eng,1
"Uthappa can do it on his day, believe",2
The sub in shambles as Uthappa hits a 4,1
All fun and games till Tewatia starts using 2% of his power.,1

"Feel incredibly bad for Tewatia. It's been such a painful innings to watch but the abuses that are about to be hurled at him in the near future are going to be much worse.

Every player has a bad day. Yes, he was abmysal with the bat but the management also has to take some responsibility for these poor tactics.",9

I feel like a meme has been born today. Tewatia = play a bunch of dot balls. Hit the same number of sixes later in the innings.,5
Twatia just did it. He's gonna go back to the dressing room and laugh about Samson denying the strike,7
He made the entire r/cricket eat their shit,11
What if final over is maiden or just one run,2
r/cricket memeing cricketers to form since forever (vPro),15

Now everyone apologize to Tewatia.,12
R/cricket : TeWaTiA should just get hitwicket,6
From most hated to most respected.,5
Just a few minutes ago everyone here was hoping that Tewatia never gets to play again. Ahahahhahahahahahahaah,5
Cotrell the true MoM,2
The only explanation is that tewatia wanted to hog the limelight and so he forced Samson into getting himself out.,6
DON'T GET ME WRONG IM HAPPY THIS MATCH  EXPOSED HOW BIG A FRAUD DHONI AND CSK ARE.,6
People tewatia is playing like Dhoni  .... Well!,2

Imagine if Sanju had run him out,6
Holy shit! What an innings Tewatia,4
"Bollywood should start recruiting script writers from IPL. BC much more exciting story arcs, that's for sure",8
Not only did good guy Tewatia give me a shit load of fantasy points. He also decided to give away his wicket to Shami to get me even more,5
From rayudu to Braithwaite.,8
I take back everything I said.,1
r/cricket : we have created a monster,6
I take it all back,2
Cottrel is always expensibe at death,3

My heart can't take this shit. My BP is done for,1
Deniel of singles might be the trigger point fir Tewatia.,3
Changing the game in 5 balls,2
Tewatia is the next MSD,5
CSK might approach Tewatia after the match. They could really use a finisher like that.,4
"Last 12 balls

In hindsight Tewatia's innings contributed much more than Rahul's,10
Greatest match ever !,7
"Rajasthan is way ahead of other teams, what an all-round squad they have",13
"Tewatia is what we want 3D to be. At this point, we've players in every position who play like unfulfilled dreams compared to players playing in the same positions in other teams. Make sense of that.",16
samson should get the MoTM,10
Sorry for my shite comments Boss Tewatia,24
RR showing CSK how it‚Äôs done,21
Commentators look like absolute idiots. Love it.,19
"Fuck me, I don't care if it's scripted or what. It was entertaining, it was unpredictable and I am completely satisfied",9
"Tewatia played the most insane Uno reverse card on r/cricket.

I can't fucking believe what I just witnessed!",40
You can get out of RCB but RCB can't get out of you,11
So now KXIP and CSK have same points. KXIP ahead due to.....NRR,7
Mayank the RCB undercover agent,8
"~~Bottas~~ Tewatia -  **to whom it may concern, fuck you.**",16
Utter madness. What a game!,9
Tewatia destroyed Agarwal innings,8
Wow. What a chase!,5
Never expected the match to go like this. Poor bowlers though.,8
JINXING WORKED. But boy Rahul Tewatia just showed us why he is playing at international level T20 league and we are just keyboard warriors.,36
MOST WTF MATCH EVER!!,14
"Well i'll be damned, mother of all Zero to Hero shit. Amazing game.",10
Hall of fame game right here,6
Tewatia for MOTM. Talk about turning from a villian to a hero in a span of a few minutes! Take a bow!,10
Anyone wanna start a religion with Tewatiya as the sole god?,15
Absolutely surreal viewing that.,7
Mind boggling match. Highest run chase in IPL. Sharjah is old Chinnaswami confirmed. Hopefully this match will usher in more exciting matches.,11
This game made up for how boring the last 2 games were,11
"RAJASTHAN ROYALS AND ESPECIALLY TEWATIA, TAKE A BOW MY KING!",13
"Benchod! What. A. Game! 
I was hoping tawaria would hit wicket earlier in his innings lol.",15
I just came seeing this match,5
"Rr chasing 224 without Buttler firing n stokes not playing

Never imagined this",15
K11P: we were 18 runs short.,5
They were short by 15-20 runs.,9
"**Highest successful chases in IPL**

**223 RR vs KXIP Sharjah 2020**

215 RR vs Deccan Hyderabad 2008

209 DD vs GL Delhi 2017",6
"Ayy, a chasing team won this time, a chane in trend",5
Biggest plot twist I've seen in ipl.,9
Tewatia went from edging to r/edging (NSFW).,10
Best T20 match I‚Äôve ever watched. Better than international matches,11
Where are all the dhenier fanbois ?,5
The way kxip threw this match was extremely impressive,10
Wait WHAAAAAATTTTTT. I went for 15 mins and the fuck happened. Whh... The... Waat... What happened.?,11
seriously how the fuck you lose two games which were pretty much impossible to lose smh.,12
One of the best matches of IPL,8
THESE GAMES!! SO LIT!!!,3

"I know we saw some mad hitting towards the end, but props to Steve Smith for setting the tone up front. That was some statement from him. That's how you lead from the front as a skipper.",19
OSCARS 2021 BEST SCREENPLAY : TEWATIA INNINGS TODAY.,17
actually can't think of a better T20 I've ever seen,20
So 2 30-runs overs have cost KXIP have cost them 2 games.,6
That was a robbery under flood lights,7
Best T20 match I‚Äôve ever watched. Better than international matches,10
"Man if you can't defend 223, the reason is not because KL scored slowly. Punjab was way way ahead till 18th over.",8
Tewatia to r/cricket- who has the humiliation fetish now?,11
So Punjab has not only taken RCB player they have taken their luck too lmao,15
Unbelievable Jeff,1
even fixers won't risk this script as it would be too obvious,17
Archer 13 run in  3 balls. Bowlers are better than some of the batsman of RR,13
Feel bad for KL and Agarwal...But yeah Tewatia was fucking brutal..You need balls of fucking gold to comeback after the disastrous start,15
A great day indeed whenever a good portion of fickle r/cricket fans get trolled.,14
"lmao imagine being Agarwal, two of your best IPL innings both end in a loss",48
This was so chaotic i can't even,4
**Bad captaincy anyone?** Kohli's influence?,10
"So many redemptions in this match-

Smith and his decision to chase

Tewatia and the greatest come back since Kim Kardashian

Samson and his answer to the critics who said his one good innings if the year was done",72
it's so fucked up how you can go from struggling to hit over the inner ring and then be able to hit 6s in 7 balls,34
Tewatia is the new samson,8
"After first innings many people said, if Buttler doesn't fire RR should go for NRR. Wow.. What a win.",12
Wah maan gaye Mukesh bhai kya script likhi thi,10
"Feel bad for kxip, those could as well be 6/6 points...4/6 atleast",8
"this thread is gonna go down in history, to show how clutch this game was",11
Tewatia was playing 8D chess by making Cortrell underestimate him by playing shitty,65
[removed],21
One over can change your life.,17
Tewatia 0 fours 7 sixes. one of the most absurd innings i have ever seen in my life. well played,17
That's two heart breaks in three matches for Punjab.,14
Tewatia should get MotM. That was some redemption.,15
Thanks Jay Shah for employing Christopher Nolan to write the script for this match.,17
After Samson I expected them to lose for sure. What a game.,17
"**Highest target successfully chased in last 4 overs in IPL**

"Gents, we witnessed an ATG match. 

It was great to have your company.

This is the match that will be remembered forever.",20
"Theres a life lesson here..No matter how hard the times seem now, just stay strong and there will be a Cottrell 30-run  over incoming",43
Tewatia was trolling us. He could have done this from ball one but that would have been all too easy for him.,15
It was a good payday for my fantasy team haha. Wish Samson had finished his century though,4
Will say it again: Sharjah is a bowler's fucking graveyard,11
"I thought in 2020 RCB will be different.

No, RCB remains same it's everyone else playing like RCB.",19
Tewatia will forever be an inspiration for me to never give up in life.,43
"If they ever make a movie on Tewatia, this match would be the climax.",10
"Mayank Agarwal will be gutted, thats 2 games now where he's got big runs and ended up on the losing side by the slimmest of margins.",15
Sir Rahul Tewatia. Take your knighthood and get the fuck outta here and rest inside some temple made for you,25
KXIP is from RCB players. I can see it now!,14
Tewatia struggled against spin and murdered pace. Ekdum opposite to normal Indian domestic players.,34
Tewatia crossed his NoHit-BroHit line and look what happened...,27
"This is how a 200+ chase is being done, well played RR.",13
KL's captaincy?,-2
#\#HALLA BOL!,15
As a CSK fan glad to see some teams showing us what is possible with a young team. Also for the Indian talent on display!,13
Why is Tiwatia so stoic,15
Script of this match should be considered for Oscars next year,23
"This chase takes me back to 2008, when RR chased an improbable 215 against DC, when Symonds made his cracking 100. You'll also see Graeme in that 435 chase mood that evening - he made 71 (45)!",8
Everyone is gay for tewatia,15
IPL is absolute madness,11

Do we have a new admission in Dinda academy,8
BAN Sharjah 58m sixes wtf,20
"Sorry Kings XI fans I don't mean to be a rebel rouser but I got down voted to hell when I kept saying Rahul should have ended his innings with a strike rate of more than 140. 

127 on this pitch was criminal and it turned out to be true.",12
"Been watching cricket a long time, and in the space of just over a year we've seen arguably one of the best T20s of all time (RR now), ODIs (WC final) and tests (edgbastion) of all time.

Unreal.",31
One of the best T20 games ever,20
Salute for Tewatia,12
WTF was this match??,13
"Sharjah post match scenes from now on: ""Did you think 240 was enough at the half way mark?""
Losing captain: ""No, we were about 60 runs short""",26
Cracker of a game. Definitely have to re-watch it.,14
"Intent + No Execution = RCB

No Intent + Execution = CSK

Intent + Execution = RR",84
Absurd match. Massively entertaining,11
Damn I never thought I'll say this today but I'm seriously confused on who should be the MoM- Samson or Tewatia,10
From TWATia to Sir Tiwatiya we saw it all.,21
[deleted],13
This is going into all time great lists,24
I don't think KXIP can come back from the ghosts of their 1st and 3rd match.,23
Rahul Tewatia made a Snape like turnaround in everyone‚Äôs hearts lol,52
Imagine not liking cricket fuck me,78
A ridiculous game of cricket,35
Tewatia gives a befitting reply like Taapsee. üòÇ,19
"Wait, omg how did RR win?",22
"He taketh. He giveth.

Lord tewatia works in mysterious ways.",32
Good game. Enjoyed it. Hats off Tewatia. Extraordinary self-belief.,16
At one point th3 commentators were saying how tewatia should throw his wicket by walking down the pitch. Oh what self belief and what a reply.,18
Romg rahul smiling but crying inside,17

Never underestimate the underdog!,2
I'm sorry Tewatia I doubted your ability.,7
"So we'll meet tomorrow for hopefully an exciting, good encounter. RCB v MI.",5

"Tewatia.. take a bow.. after all that it takes some guts to pull that off..

and yes.. i am sorry we s*it on u so much..

insane game of cricket..",14
KXIP matches are just class apart from others. Too exciting every season,13
plz drop uthappa next game and team could actually be great.,0
tewatia you absolute beauty,1
Thats two difficult losses for KXIP,13
"feeling bad for Mayank, in first game he scored 91 and now a century. KXIP ends up being losing side in both games.",15
Will be interesting to see this RR play in Dubai/Abu Dhabi,6
Denying that single by Sanju ignited the fire inside Tewatia.,56
All I have to say is wtf,10
If only they troll even more by awarding MoM to Tewatia,11
"Man, I just feel sooo haply for tewatia. Imagine being in the middle with 8(19). Imagine if he got out after that.... Could have really fucked him up.",15
"A spectacle for the ages, can't quite believe what I have just witnessed. This was some absolutely extraordinary stuff.",11
This shows how badly RCB bottled it. Ffs..they had much better batting line up than RR.,9
RCB should learn from this chase and how not to give up after skippers dismissal and have confidence in other players,39
"A testament to why cricket is the greatest sport ever! I'm a test purist, but this really encapsulated the spirit of the game.

I'd say greatest ipl t20 of all time.",63
"I really think the problem ultimately was the slight slowing down by our batting after Rahul was gone, we looked to get around 235 and got 10 runs short. Bowling wise both teams were about at par",10
Tewatia's innings is the cricket equivalent of cramming for exams and succeding,109
Every single Non-SRH matchthread is slowly and steadily pushing me into the Twilight zone. Where mind meets Madness and skill meets Shithousery.,12
"Makes me think guys like Malinga, bumrah , rabada are gold for their teams..they seldom lose it from that stage.",30
"Kxip in last 5 - 51 runs

Rr in 18th n 19th - 49 runs

That was the difference",21
This kind of script I can get behind lol,13
MSD should learn a thing or 2 from this game,13
Tewatia was playing in 2 matches there,18
Imagine how easy samson would have won this game with a good partnership and not the fuckmashery that happened in the mid overs. Most WTF match ever Jesus !!,16
Everyone frantically deleting comments/tweets berating tewatia they posted few minutes ago üòÉ,51
I'm sorry I called him TeWHYTHEFUCK but it should have been TeWOWTHEFUCK,10
Ah fuck we have 2 games in Sharjah and one of them against CSK,12
Every year there is some RR match where we pull a win out of nowhere,15
An all time classic match.,4
"Unlucky kings xi, should have won 3/3",5
"KL is such a gentleman, so gracious in defeat.",20
Poor KXIP. Luck is not on their side despite terrific batting performances today and in the match against DC as well.,5
This really is one of the greatest IPL games of all time. Just fuckin unbelievable how it turned out.,25
They say life is full of surprises. Even they will be surprised,18
What a Match üëèüëè,11
Tewatia: Call an ambulance! BUT NOT FOR ME!,128
Meanwhile Dhoni not able to figure out why RR tried to chase down a huge target so EARLY in the tournament.,29
"Mayank Agarwal score 89, century and still ends up on the losing side",18
We all should apologize to Tewatia.,19
I missed a good game :(,5
Poor captaincy by KL today. Tewatia was struggling hard against leg spin and he brought Maxwell back instead of Murugan. And I have nussing to say about Cottrell's shocking death bowling. Even Shami was poor,7
"I hate it when something special happens in cricket, specially T20, everybody just says it's a fixed match. Like come on people give the players the credit.",23

just 2020 things fr,4
"RR did well. They just need to cut out the stupid sweep shots that never paid off.  


When you have hitters like Samson, Tewatia, Archer, Smith etc., why do you need to try sweep?",10
Should've been 3 out of 3 for KXIP,9
Sorry 'Daddy' Tewatia for the comparison with Murali Vijay. You can take away my virginity now.,14
Can I post a meme in this sub?,10
I sincerely apologize for the tewatia comments.,15
Get your yorkers right in the next match.,5
I was here to witness this epic game of cricket....,8
Rahul being classy. Not throwing his bowlers under the bus.,19
What the fuck did happen? I went to watch Mahabharat characters. And the whole game turned upside down.,13

"Man I felt so bad for Tewatia in those early overs, everyone was dissing him and even his own team were like just gtfo already. But then that comeback... He just made me remember why the hell I loved cricket in the first place..Holy shit.. I never saw it coming! +Respect my man!",23
0 fours 7 sixes lmao,18
You don't bowl a part time finger spinner to Samson in the 16th over.,17

Even though we won but for the last time fuck this stadium,14
"449 runs scored in 40 overs. Cannot ask for a better entertainment on Sunday . 

This is why I don't agree with ten-ten matches. Tewaria would have been clown if he was got hit wicket or self runout ..but look at his comeback..never seen someone hit sixes just standing where they are without any leg work or swing of bat..just wrist move connecting bottom of the bat.",15
"*Now I‚Äôm better* - Tewatia

Oh man you‚Äôre just amazing.",18
"Hell, yes. Taking game deep without loosing - everything Dhoni wished to be but could never emulate to the same level.

Telling the world to fuck off and FOLLOWING it up with fuckoffesque performances - that's some alpha shit right there. Tewatia has revitalised bragging about big dicks and then actually having a 13-incher - and that's a good recipe for fun times (no homo... I think?)

He's a spicee boii, is that Tewatia",14
That over to Maxwell was bad captaincy. The danger was Samson so Ashwin should have bowled turning the ball away.,11

"Personally, I needed to see that Tewatia inning. Keep calm and carry on!",12
Cotteral has been dishonorably discharged from the military,14
They found someone to bat at 4 who is exactly opposite to rahane. 0 fours and 7 sixes lol.,13
Take notes RCB! This is how you fucking chase without shitting your pants!!,18
Maxi opened the floodgates really,3
Wonder what's waiting for Tewatia on his phone. Probably lots of deleted messages on his Whatsapp.,133
"If all teams had the same attitude as CSK, we'd never get games like this",28

Tewatia take a bow. What this guy just did deserves a LOT of respect.,10
Tewatia hit as many sixes as Samson,16
My prediction was right when Tewatia was 8(19) LOL,14
"This game had it all. Very high chase, excellent fielding, especially that pooran save, Tewatia piss poor, RRR @ 17 and of course, Tewatia redemption arc. Amazing.",12

So Brian Lara has predicted 3 out of 3 wins so far!!!,15
Why do I keep supporting this team which out of nowhere seems to bottle the easiest of wins. We like Barca in the champions league bruhh. Except we had like a 6-0 lead in the first leg and somehow still lose 7-6. How does Tewatia go from meme player to prime chris Gayle? Why does this only happen to us,7

The commentators should be ashamed of what they said about Tewatia‚Äôs innings. They of all people should know the game has glorious uncertainties.,12
"WTF was this match. I don't abuse but what the absolute shit. High scoring, great batting, great fielding.

Tevatia as villain.. Tevatia as hero. My father was like  from what shit part of India they picked tevatia and then he was like he is a fucking fuckster.

IDK how can I display my fucking feelings, as a Rajasthan Royals fan I am shitting joy.

What the fuck did I just fucking saw?",26
PRANKSTAR of the year Award goes to my BOI TEWATIA,17
This match was as crazy as Mi  vs RR 14 overs chase just coz of tewatia. But then it's hard to be bowler in such a small ground,10
">**Rahul Tewatia:** Now I am better. The worst 20 balls I have ever played. After that I began to hit so I kept going. The dugout knows I can hit the ball long. I knew I had to believe in myself. It was a matter of one six. Five in the over, that is amazing. I tried to hit the legspinner, but unfortunately I couldn't. So I had to hit other bowlers.

WTF ARE THESE AWARDS LOL,10
"Truth to be told, I don't even like such matches. Bring back the classics where batsmen shit their pants while hitting a boundary, test wicketkeeper are sent at No. 4 to accelerate and end up with under 100 strike rate, tail starts at No. 3 etc etc. Those matches are my jam, you know.",4
Everyone losing their shit over Tewatia. But lets not forget Sanju Samson's innings too .,26

that last  maxwell over was completely unnecessary. shifted the whole momentum in six balls,9
"Such a wholesome conversation with Steve Smith, its so nice hearing these experienced captains talking about what they see in their young talent",18

"When Dravid threw his cap at Wankhede I threw an imaginary cap off my head too.

Today I can put that cap back on.

Sorry if I am spamming this thread but I am a Royals fan and we fucking won an absolute fucking unwinnable game with the help of a fucker nobody would have took a selfie with two overs back and then he fucked the entire Sharjah with his batting.",45
Rajasthan's journey from the most boring team to the most exciting team.,21

in case you guys don't know tewatia is also from rcb,40
When I saw the RRR go over 15 I honestly thought there was no way RR could win the game. Then Tewatia went hulk on Cottrell.,19
This game had it all. Thank you all for tuning in and making my evening with this glorious thread,16
I have a dream that one day RCB will bat first at Sharjah and prove everyone that it is not the absolute belter of a pitch everyone thinks it is. I have a dream...,43
It's going to be tough replacing Tewatia with Ben Stokes...,23
"This is RR's redemption story, right here.",15
There should have been 6 sixes in that over lmaooo,24

People the match and this thread. If you have any history books throw em out because if this is not in there it's worthless,18
Tewatiya making everyone (including myself) eat their words. You love to see it.,20
Samson said that he hits well because his father is powerful lol,18
Why was Shami bowling a short ball to a 6 foot man on a slow pitch with 60m boundaries when he has such a good yorker ffs?,19
KXIP with all the Karnataka boys feeling homesick and trying to morph into peak RCB,31
tbf I do not remember a single yorker that was bowled in the last few overs by cotrell and shami. extraordinary batting but some below average bowling,17
We need to do something about that non existent death bowling,18
"A question , What would have been the result of the game if stadium was not empty?

Well as you know sometimes fans are pretty toxic",17
Tewatia biopic when?,23
"Harsha is right if anybody told you what the end was they are either lying, drunk or don't know what they are talking about.",18
I have seen tewatia sixes on iplt20. Where can i see his initial struggle innings of 8(19)?,22
Akshay Kumar has probably acquired rights for Tewatia Biopic by now. You cannot get more drama than this!!,28
12th oct. RCB vs Russell at Sharjah. Can't wait,29
"Tewatiya did the cricket equivalent of ""How to master C++ in  7 days"".",42
Rahul Gandhi must have got inspired after Tewatia's innings /s,15
Seems like RCB of 2016 scoring 200 every match and see it being chased. Feel for the bowlers though.,19
I have seen school grounds bigger than Sharjah's stadium xD,29
"With all the comparisons to CSK's approach at chasing, I just wanna add that whether as fan of either team or a neutral, as a watcher I'd prefer a game where both teams are trying to win. That's what makes it entertaining. 

Thanks RR for showing how to keep trying until the last ball.",23
"Broadcasters should start showing matches like or talk about it rather than saying dhoni returned after 435 days , nothing against dhoni but it's very boring",17
I feel turning point was when samson denied tewatia the single thats when the transformation of being the incredible hulk began.,45
Sharjah graveyard for bowlers,20
I'm still high on adrenaline and I can't sleep.,10
"Props to Tewatia but you gotta blame KXIP for the poor choices they made. Why would KL Rahul choose to bowl Maxwell(16th over) to a set Sanju Sampson? They should have closed the match when it was 84 off 30 balls. And, from quality bowlers like Shami and Cotrell, that was a very disappointing performance.",9
"I still cannot believe what I watched today, this is just too much to take in, who would have thought man, what a game, this is why I love cricket",6

I'm not being able to leave the match thread,9
Imagine the riot when dhoni denies a single and the non striker wins it for them,14
"Unrelated, but someone make a SRH subreddit please. I'm tired of slandering my team in public.",19
Samson has a strike-rate of 215 this season. Fucking insane,18
"Whenever they show an aerial shot of the stadium, if you look at the top left/northwest corner, you see another Cricket ground. Any idea which ground it is?",4
anyone know where i can rewatch the last 4 overs?,14
Tewatia's inning was a big Middle finger to Dhoni,29
8(19) to 50 (31) what a turn around. From zero to hero in one over!,16
"I don't see people appreciating Smith enough. Went on to open the innings, Did everything initially, and literally set the platform for the middle order.",27
"If you have 3 hours to spare and are deciding what to watch, 

WATCH THIS FREAKING MATCH.",28
Tewatia is the guy who whom you are disappointed to have in your group project but ends up winning it for you.,30

"Could someone post what smith had said in the presentation. I think cricbuzz has got it wrong


[Smith presentation](https://i.imgur.com/eTLEWmG.jpg)

Smith said how Tewatia said to him that he believed he could hit 3 sixes of shami or cortell and man that was very inspiring to me hearing that.",21
If only folks had half the confidence of Tewatia!,11
How do you guys refresh to get NEW comments? I have to manually pulldown to refresh. I'm on Android App.,14
Highest fantasy points? I am assuming you all must have easily 400+ from today's game! üòÑ,7
"What the Fuck did I just watched...! 
That was a treat...!",9
Most stunning match evah. What a redemption for tewatia. All his critics including myself proved spectacularly wrong. That said bowling also missed a beat at the end though it was forced,25
RRüî•üî•üî•,7
Rajput's 16th over is equally important. He gave only 6 runs in that over and this is when punjab's batting lost momentum in the death overs.,30
The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you - NDT,24
"Thanks RR and kxip for an amazing Sunday match, love you guys.

We showed intent from the start, as I said Smith was  confident in his [decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j0q0o6/match_thread_9th_match_rajasthan_royals_v_kings/g6uqk8h?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

I hope Mayank's amazing innings doesn't go unnoticed.",15
"Cotrell be like:Ekdum se inhone waqt badal diya ,jazbaat  badal diya,jindagi badal di",19
My life lesson from Tewatia's innings is that I could either finish my work on time by doing something everyday or I could get the thrill of finishing it just before the deadline after days of procrastination,31
I guess the people totally forgot about parag who got out for a duck it's really bad you can't forget his duck due to extremely good effort by Tewatia I hope he improves,4
Never seen a player go from zero to hero in the same innings,7
I really wanted Punjab to win,3
"A quick glance over the 'crickiverse' this morning, and there seems to be some sense that this will go down as one of the more memorable games in IPL history.

Seeing as this is my first season watching IPL, that I adopted RR pre-season (\#HallaBol), and watched every ball of their last two games, of course I am delighted. I'm also a little scared that my viewing has peeked too soon and that it will be all downhill from here.

That's being a sports fan, I suppose üëç. Now I'm off to find someone in IND who has a paypal account who is willing to get and mail to the UK a RR jersey.",18
