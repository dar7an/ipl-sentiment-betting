"this match: *exists*

me: I pretend not to see it",5
"Comeon boys...halla bol....lekin mi pr, rather than on yourselves",2
RR has such potential. They needs sort their batting order. I am confident this team is more than capable to beat any team on their day.,6
MI have mercy,6
Archer to take 4 wickets and MI win by 6 wickets?,7
Fun fact : in last 5 matches between these teams rr have won 4,11
Rr wins . r/Cricket in shambles !,17
Ah yes. Suffering from agony vs Suffering from success,7
[removed],4
I hope they open with Buttler and Uthappa.,1
Can't wait for Jof and Tewatia to open the batting,13
Pls remove stokes and bring in David miller,1
Will Rohit play today?,3
"MI need to end the coulter nile experiment, his batting isn't good enough to compensate for his bowling.",10
RR for gods love win today please.,6
" Samson is basically the Bottas of cricket. Hypes everyone up at the beginning of the season, only to taper off consistently",5
"I don't even remember when I last saw a good Pollard performance. It just shows how good we've been throughout the tournament. This may not make sense, but MI please don't play so good. I wanna see my polly bat.",3
Hopefully RR again open with Stokes today and place Buttler down the order :P,6
MI should bat second if they win the toss. Maybe bring in Pattinson for NCN? Will Boult get a rest? Pollard did say there won’t be much experimentation now on but it could be to throw teams off plans or something.,4
I swear to god if Benjamin is opening again I'm gonna take a Ceat Tyres strategic timeout on life,73
RR might not be in the best of form but they have consistently got the wood over us in the last few years. The first match this year might just be an anomaly.,16
Play Jaiswal,0
"Mi might give rohit rest again and play many players from the bench. I want to see Mitchell McCleneghan, lynn and tare.",1
"Think they should bring in Pattinson for Coulter-Nile today and get some wickets upfront

Edit: Yay!",3
Guys I'm starting a new gambling app based on predicting RR's opening combination. Any early investors?,14
Last Sunday we had to miss the first few overs because the KKR SRH Super Over was still going on. Today we are done with the post match presentation even before the toss,6
This IPL is kind of snooze fest except KXIP matches.,0
"If RR wins,I will make out with the girl I like.


Which will never happen.",4
"1. Uthappa
2. Buttler
3. Smith (C)
4. Samson (WK)
5. Stokes
6. Parag
7. Lord
8. Archer
9. Gopal
10. Tyagi
11. Aaron/ Singh




Literally how hard is that?",5
"Guys, i didn't watch RCB CSK match. What really happened?",1
Hope killer miller plays today,4
Pollard is captaining again.,12
RRs night. Sorry MI,-6
Na harsha today is NABAMI(9) NOT DASHAMI (10),4
So batting for MI,1
[deleted],5
Mi has chosen to win during toss.,8
Pattinson in finally,2
"MI are batting first. (Pollard is captaining)

No changes for RR, Pattinson in for NCN.",4
Pattinson is back. Good.,6
Who was that girl in pre toss presentation?,1
Tewatia to score century with bat signed by kohli to help RCB still have hopes for the top two spots.,5
Jofra vs ishu. Will be interesting.,1
If ben stokes opens today then we can safely say that McDonald is scamming RR,10
"RR and Delhi have been Mumbai's Kryptonite (I don't know why). Hoping for a good match


Also can someone make a teekha paani puri with jamalghota for Butler so that he has loose motion by the time he comes to crease?",5
Guys what happend to Rohit Sharma?,5
[deleted],49
Kishan vs Archer will be interesting.,4
[deleted],7
Rohits gotten thick again,1
Where is that probabilities guy with his post today? Doesn’t seem to have posted after the last match.,6
"Ah yes, our home ground

Abu dhabi",5
"""Kung Fu Pandya"" should be stopped",8
I'm not even raising my hopes up even if MI are dismissed for 132,3
Buttler gives 0 fucks for that power competition.,25
Thank fuck Pattinson is back in.,7
"What is a ""spek"" in this prematch segment?",3
Prediction: Samson will make a 50+ score today..,14
"RR batting second is definetly good for us,because our bowling lineup sucks and it will be hard to defend any score especially against mumbai. We have good batsmen,not everyone in form, but could pull a tewatia any moment. So i have hope in this game",3
"Please for the love of God, don't open with stokes again",4
Backing RR to finish it with a hat-trick of top3 humbling this weekend,5
QDK is us in Vivas,6
[deleted],7
de Kock seems like such a genuine guy,4
Why do they ask shit questions to qdk everytime like he is a youngster. He is the captain of South Africa lmao,73
"I kinda feel that Archer is the only great bowler in RR(or the only bowler in great form), it would be good if we just get a good pace bowler to back him up. Unadkat and Rajpoot aint good at all, while Tyagi is still young.",5
Just need RR to come to the party today and then it'll be the perfect day,5
Fact: kishan opened with baz in Gujarat lions,8
Lol what is the key to you getting runs in ipl.  Spectacular question,3
"Even CSK gave their bench players a chance towards the end.

But no love for my boi Miller. Surely he deserves to play over Stokesy. Just give him 2-3 games at least ffs!",12
De kock is speaking like he was about to go take a shit and these commentators called him for interview lol,11
"RR fans: please don't make Stokes open

Smith : [...](https://i.redd.it/r488a47ti2f51.jpg)",5

Kinda wanna see Lynn play a few tbh,2
is this presenter dumb!!!,5
This bitch stooooooooopid.,1
Oh my god this quiz is so annoying,5
I would rather stare at my ex's pic than watching this match.,7
Mumbai's matches are really stretched out.  They played the first match and will play the last match as well,4
Rohit doesn't talk much but when he is in mood he is sehwag 2.0. i really want to see him among pundits after he retires.,4
Nehraji going for the kill on that CricViz analyst,1
Rr fan here. Ready to be hurt again :),6
Rr fan here. Ready to be hurt again :),9

Edit - For this match

Which team are you supporting and why?",2
CSK's all time worst team still managed to beat RCB's peak team LMAO.,5
"I want any team other than MI to win the cup. 

Guess this is how Pakistani fans feel when they want any other team other than India to win after getting knocked out.",5
The reverse jinxing from RR fans is through the roof in this thread. Lmao,3
Tonight it's gonna be MI fans vs everyone else on this thread. Bring it.,3
Can't see how but RR winning will really light up the play off race,1
Is anyone supporting MI today? I've even seen some mumbai flair users rooting for rajasthan :(((,4
"Last Sunday, table toppers MI played the team at the bottom of the table KXIP, and lost. Today RR at the bottom of the table ....",3
"Come on my RR brothers, lets huddle together so that no one can see us cry and we don’t feel scared of these Ambani boys.",14
"Crazy that of the 3 matches MI have lost, 2 have gone to a super over, one of which had 2 super overs

Shows how difficult they are to defeat",46
MI still playing for NRR by choosing to bat first.,1
"You legit have to spend 30 minutes, get a magnifying glass and sacrifice your first born to find these match threads. Please pin these fml",11
I knew we lost the match the moment Padikkal got out before scoring 30.,6
MI batting line-up looks so bland without Rohit Sharma,2
Hoping for a MI win so the competition at least has one team that deserves to win the whole thing.,2
Lord with sunhat is the most dangerous lord,2
"Dead RCB fans, 
There is a seperate post match thread for your loss banter and coping. Don't ruin this thread.
Thankyou.",6
I’m not having that Uthappa is 34. He looks older than time itself.,6

Clones at the crease.,3

"Upvote the match thread guys, had to scroll a lot to find this",7
"If jofra dont take wickets in powerplay,we are fucked",5
Just play out archer guys...,4
Not expecting anything apart from another loss.,6
Here RCB fans we'll show you how to put up a real target!,-1
c’mon archer.. our lord and saviour,1
MI even without Rohit looks formidable,7
"Gentle reminder that Pollard averages 208 in this IPL, only being dismissed in the very first match",3
"I know Jof is the quickest in the tournament, but the last few games he’s seemed to have been bowling absolute rockets. Everyone seems rushed for pace.",2
Finally found the thread,14
Take that,2
Cunted,2
de Kock hard already,5
that stung harder than I thought it would,5
"Ok, six on the first over of Jofra, we officially lose",5
"That wasn't cunted, that was K O C K E D",5
fucking hell qdk is good,2
This is out. Hit too hard.,1
That is a ridiculously good cricket shot,4
De kock stands tall and delivers.,3

HELLO FUCKING HELLO,9
WHAT A COMEBACK,12
r/cricket Jinx MF,12
Lmao Jofra you are the best troll,34
Fuck. Can't even get angry cause it's Quinny,13
Sanson,3
y’all were saying 🌚,10
FUCK IT BOWL FAST,12
JOFRAAAAAAAA,5
49 allout?,-3
Looks like he got too Kocky,8
Good. I took ishaan over kock in my fantasy,3
Archer is OP. Seriously.,11
The sanson virus is invading.,5
"Archer is very very good, he has the pace of Nortje and wicket taking nature of Rabada. Simply too good",16
Kock blocked,3
No Quinny ☹️,2
Bruh,1
Why does de Kock always look guilty?,23
"Hey is everyone in this IPL suffering from the ""Samson Syndrome"" i.e. hit a 6 and get out??",4
One does not hit Jofra for 6 in the first over and get away with it,8
Universe Jof?,12
"**0.5** Archer to de Kock, OUT, **chopped on!** Jofra delivers, almost every time. Good length and swung away outside off. Stays still and reaches out with an angled bat, trying to stab that towards third man. It's a big inside edge onto stumps **7-1**

Q de Kock  b Archer 6 (4b 0x4 1x6) SR: 150.00",2
"Upvote the thread guys, it's too down below",8
"Right now Rohit is that guy in gully cricket who says ""Ha bache log, ab tum khelo""

T: Kids, now your turn to play",7
Keep calm and believe in Jofradamus,7
"A rare failure for De Kock and that alone significantly improves RR's chances of winning.


I'd bet on RR to win now.",6
Quality shot for six. Then a half assed cut chopped on the stumps. QdK shows his pro and cons in 2 balls.,7

Mi Gus. Can we get sky in place of pandeyji?,2
"Ian Bishop during MI Vs KXIP: I am sure Preity Zinta won't be happy with ""the Cock"" standing hard & long here.",24
Aight SKY time to be back in form again,6
did jofra say “bye bye” LMAO,12
"So we are done for this year already right? Given SRH, KKR, Kxip all 3 have better NRR",6
The other RR bowlers should also keep it strong from the other end. Archer seems like a lonely attacker in the RR bowling unit.,6
"Lol what is qdk thinking? Going after the best bowler of IPL, no shit he will come back at you",2
Rr probably has the most bat deep team in the league and still don’t know how to utilise that,10
As soon as he hit that six I knew jof gonna strike back with a wicket,6
"What the hell is Smith doing at 5.

Still can’t believe that they have Stokes opening and Buttler at 4",4
Why Thickwari?? why not Tare??,0
"Archer is the worlds best fast bowler with Rabada a close second and bumrah a close third.

That's IMO.",3
RR either needed TEWATIA or csk to win matches.,6
"I started watching cricket around 2009-2010, so tell me this- is MI as dominant a side as Australia was in the 2000s, or were Aus even better? Because the tales I've heard are legendary",7

For the last time people, match threads are linked in the daily discussion threads, which *are* pinned",56
Imagine if we win lol,3
That’s unlucky,3
QDK lite escapes. Hmmmm.,4
Mi should have played tare just to fuck with RR fans. Also none of the rr players from 2014 plays in this team.,9
"Left hander, better in middle overs against spin. Tare likes pace",3
[deleted],2
Whos a little worried today?,6
is Rohit injured?,5
" Man i want to see Rabada, Bumrah, Archer, Rashid and Chahal in one team",13
Why do we lose against meme teams :(,14
"Hot damnn! kishan almost did a QDK! 

Pitch 2 paced or just silly batting?",5
How come tiwary is next best batsman on MI bench to replace someone.,3
"I don't mind QDK getting out actually. This match is not a must win, and it helps give more practice to others before the playoffs",8
Didn't even realize QDK got out. Kept replaying his six lol,7
I love Kishan’s little head gesture after he hits those shots👌🏽👍🏽,5
"Ankit Rajpoot is hopelessly mediocre. I remember his wink against MI last season and, boy, how he regretted that afterwards.",12
"Difference between MI and RCB is that you're like ""Oh fuck Kohli is gonna bury the run rate "" regardless of whether he comes in at 5/1 or 85/1 but with SKY, you're happy to see him bat regardless of whether it's 0/1 or 125/1. 

I'm only talking about the Kohli of IPL 2020, btw. Just to make it clear.",9
Come on Jofra take 9 more wickets,6
"Archer's delivery went through De Kock


*A terrible way to die in the medieval times*",18
2034 - RR stil trying to sneak in play off,5
Bas Karo. Rr is being gang banged by all teams. Why tf manoj,3
"Qdk did a samson, hit 6 and get out",7
Oh god Jofra don't kill the child Jesus Christ,15
"Have to root for MI, I guess. I am not one of those csk fans that is desperate for us to make playoffs, but I wouldn’t be opposed

I usually like all IPL teams but the arrogance and trolling from MI people on here has made it a bit tough! Go Bumrah and co tho!",2
Jofra is too good,8
He looks in agony. Must have hit a real soft spot.,5
[deleted],21
"If you can't beat em, injure em",9
Kishan getting knocked the fuck out with a hit to the pad. Archer is a cheat code.,16
I have started to really hate these dream11 ads now.. Have turned into cringey now.. Also so you guys know anybody who has won that 1 crore thing on dream11,9
How stacked are MI you ask? Chris Lynn is their *back up* foreign opener,32

Magic spray does its work yet again.,3
"Archer is looking at Ishan like ""that wasn't even my effort ball mate""",7
Remember when Dream11 ads used be those shady photoshopped ads with Harsha in cricbuzz. It’s come a long way since then.,2
Just give him the magic spray ffs,6
Magic spray doing the work,2
what did it hit? seemed like it came off the bat?,4
"That clearly hit the pads, what happened there?",5
"no wicket here, no win for us",4
No mercy from Archer. As it should be,4
Ummm what's the deal with taking Archer on? There are 16 overs from weaker bowlers to attack.,9
"Bruh kishan, play out archer

There r ton of bowlers to target except him",6
Ishan Kishan simp gang where you at,7
I got my sleeve tats from the same guy that did Kishan and Pandyas sleeve.,7
"Judge me all you want but I think this new generation of players are too much of sassy/weak, every now then for small shit they need physio - I can still remember how Watson played with blood oozing out from his knees, how Akhtar use to put injection in his knees to take out water out before bowling etc.",8
We need to do something about bowling quotas. Just unfair that the best bowlers can only impact 24 balls a match!!,4
Is Ishan Kishan a Marwari?,0
"On a side note, pretty bold/unusual of RR to pick the Barbie Pink colour for their outfits. Is there any other sports team that does that?",4
"Archer is too hot to handle even in international cricket. 
 
Most of the domestic players probably never played someone as fast as him",6
Kishan is out plumb there. RR needs to take this review!!,-1
"I still can’t get used to the crowd noise when the ball beats the infield. It makes me think “must be four”, and then a bloke comes into shot on the boundary as it dribbles to him for one.",13
Remember when Rajpoot winked at Pollard and got smoked all over the park after that,11
"Daren ganga is a pretty good commentator, idk but he has a nice smart voice",4
What Arabic song is playing?,2
I really have a good fucking laugh when these players scream their lungs out to appeal but then don't review.,6
They just got 4 leg byes btw,13
"Lmao, that went for 4?",7
Why are some MI fans rooting against their own team here?😂😂,7
Omg phew! what a blunder by RR not to review,5
Why is pitching in line a thing? What difference does it make if the ball goes on to hit the stumps?,4
Don't use GM bats to avoid chopping on.,3
Sigh. No good fights this IPL. Can pollard and jofra fight today please?,7
Oof good not to review I guess,4
"RCB in Green Jersey:

Played : 10

Won : 2

Lost : 7

No result : 1",4
The way Smith was giving a speech at hurdle at the beginning of the match and uttappa interview makes me believe RR are playing this game with a strong mentatily..,3
"Sanju fans be like ""Atleast he takes reviews like Dhoni, should be in the Indian team""",2
"Cmon Rajput, you can do this. These extras could cost us if it gets tight",6

Anyone else find it weird that they have an announcer voice pumping up a fake crowd?,17
"4LB, 2 wides...tf is happening",2
SKY has automatically disqualified himself from Indian selection by shaving his beard.,37
Extras going nuts this over,3
Ishan kishan is 2017 Rishabh pant,2
Archer sets a good tone and then the other bowlers fuck it up.,9
We are fucked. Rr is basically getting raped,2
"We don't even have 4 proper bowlers, how are we going to even think of winning the most competitive league",5
This Ishan lad is the real pocket dynamite,2
Fuck off with all these extras,5
"The extras cost indirectly also, the momentum is broken and then on top of that you have to bowl another bowl which could go for boundaries. Poor Bowling",1
KISHAN is LIT,2
Surely there are bowlers who are far more accurate than Rajpoot in the Indian circuit.,3
Nah rather just bowl gopal in pp so he can try for some dots.,4
This Ishan Kishan lad is good👍🏽,2
the jofra powerplay overs have the feel of the starting grid in a boring f1 race. unless something happens there you know the outcome,5
yeah I mean we’re pretty much fucked here aren’t we,2
Kishan and SKY are what Delhi fans think Pant and Iyer are.,4
Can anyone make a historical joke with respect to Ankit RAJPOOT? Thank you,3
That laugh😂😂😂😂,2
RR tricked us into thinking they were good and playing an exciting brand of cricket in the first 2 games. I want my money back.,7
I think I'd rather Smith opened the bowling than Rajpoot or Unadkat,14
"Ishan to Rohit ""Opening mai kar leta hu, aap jaa ke Dream11 pe team banao""",14

RR have been very gracious with their extras. Otherwise MI would be near run a ball right now.,5
"The way Kishan is batting, I think he will top edge one in the air soon",5

"FORTUNES 

RR : 1

MI : 2",4
Come on RR! please win this one,3
Inside edge going for a four must be one of the most frustrating things for a bowler.,2
Mumbai already got 3 fours they shouldn’t have gotten. Lucky,5
Are Rajpoot and Tyagi good in Ranji? You cant just expect 4 overs from archer to be enough to pose some bowling threat ffs,2
RR plays much better without Stokes and Butler in team.,6
Tyagi just bowled at 147 kmph,6
Inside edges and Extras are actually the ones having a partnership out there,5
Mumbai should get to 200 easy and roll Rajastan for maybe 120.,7
Is this Tyagi guy good?,3
Flick by Sky😍,7
"There might be an argument that with so many talented batsmen, that only one of Rohit or Kohli should continue playing in the t20 side. Out of the seniors only Rohit and Kohli should be selected for the t20 world cup squad.",2

That’s the funkiest scoop I’ve seen in a while,5

What exactly does Shane Warne do in the RR setup?,3

Need more extras, I guess",3

Lord Rajpoot,1
Holy Shit Rajpoot What the fuck,5
Jofra looking at the rest of these clowns like “what the fuck am I playing with?”,17
All the fast bowlers of RR except Jof are run machines,6
Raj 'wink' poot.,2
Archer desperately desperately needs a quality bowling partner,41
Why tf is rajpoot always bowling on the leg side. Bloody idiot,5
"“This is what we see from any bowler not called Jofra Archer”

Lol even the commentators said it straight",19
Rajpoot is much worse than Umesh at t20,6

Now here I am back doing all sorts of permutations and combinations on RCB not doing an epic choke and leaving things to the last match or not do a epic choke but not end up in top 2 and end up losing in playoffs.. For once can't they play normal... Always with some drama and shit... Christopher nolan movies are less complicated than thier playing way,7
good thing jofra is famously chill as imagine your effort being wasted by these idiots,5
"Rajpoot, Aaron and Unadkat are the heads of Hydra. Chop one off, another emerges.",4
Ankit Rajpoot wouldn't even make it as a net bowler for Mumbai Indians.,8
Shreya Ghoshal,3
"MI : Bumrah, Boult & Pattinson

DC : Rabada, Nortje

RR : Archer

SRH : Lord Khaleel",12
Unadkat gets a lot of shit but surely he is better than Rajpoop,1
Batting and bowling spectrum are in totally opposite end of the spectrum for RR. Feels bad for archer.,2
I'd like to see Rolly Polly come up the order tonight,2
Rajpoor should wink at Pollard or Pandya today.,8
Re should trade archer for umesh and Siraj,2
Disband this team. They're too strong,6
"Rr's bowling attack consists of Archer, Jofra, Jof, Jofra Archer and Archer Jofra",12
Why don’t real sports companies make IPL jerseys? It’s always some shit brand,3
SKY is always trying to flick just like thala is always trying to defend against spin,2
Rr's bowling is so shit,1
Nagada noises intensifying.,1
"Where do we fit SKY in a stacked Indian batting line up? I feel he is better than Shreyas ""115 SR"" Iyer.

And ffs SKY. Convert your 50s into a 100 every now and then",5
"I actually feel a bit sorry for players who are a bit shit. Like that can’t be helped. But this bloke just bowled onto Kishan’s shoulder, with fine leg up, to a 60m boundary. How braindead can you be? No excuse for that.",8
"Kishan and SKY are very good, but everytime it becomes natural for someone to drag Pant and Iyer into it when they perform. They are performing good on their accord, they are performing bad on their accord. Kishan has just started performing, Pant is not performing well now but he has done the same what Kishan is doing in the previous seasons. SKY has been consistent, well so has been Iyer. In an Ideal world all of them should play for India, who knows they might too!",7
"can another team buy jofra, he’s the only reason I’m still following this team smh",9
Mayank Markande was good for MI iirc,8
"Where is Lord Tewatia ?

Need to see Ishan take him on",6
Bring yourself on to bowl Smith you coward,16
They should have played Markande by now instead of Unadkat/Aaron/Rajpoot. Abysmal decision by the management.,8
"MI is such a good team man wtf. If I was part of the MI management I'd be disappointed with anything other than finish first, win Q1, win finals every single year",10
Sadly the biggest negative for SKY chance to nt is his age. I fear it would affect his chance mostly than talent which is there,7
I don't even feel sad at this point. It's just emptiness.,27
"RR bowling is literally Russian Roulette(RR). One in the chamber, nothing else to remember.",12
IPL after IPL we keep seeing Ankit Rajpoot and keep saying same thing. He isn't good enough. And he keeps playing.,4
The problem Ishan faces is not rotating the strike,3
SKY playing like how Kohli used to play in T20s before this season. Good strike rotation peppered with timely 4s. 1s and 2s have got into Kohli and Warner this season.,4
"Ishan just needs to rotate strike better in current innings. He has hit 3 fours and a six, yet he is 27(27)

Edit: 3x4s 1x6, thanks u/bunnyoverkill",10
"I hope we keep up this form into the playoffs. MI is playing so goddamn well recently.

Just need to shore up our play in super overs though .....

Of course, better if we just win games in regulation.",10
"Id rather see the likes of Tyagi, Mavi, Nagarkoti, Bishnoi rather than season run givers like Unadkat, Rajpoot, Siraj",7
Is SKY uncapped?,10
"Make an IPL all star XI with players from the other 7 teams, vs MI and MI will still be the stronger side lmao",16
Pollard will bat at 4 to prove to Rohit he can bat a long time.,6
Hope SKY gets an Indian cap soon. MI won't be able to retain him and he will get the money he deserves in the auction.,8
"Hey Royals,  don't drop difficult catches, lord will be angry.",3
"If Buttler comes true today we are fucked. Sanju and Smith will continue their shit single digit innings, I am sure.",5
should’ve bowled steve smith instead of rajpoot i’m not even kidding,4
Supreme beard is gone!!!,3
I hope our batsmen show up with vigour and the will to fight. That's the only way we can win the match because we have the Batsmen to chase 230+ anyday of the week.,4
Just realized SKY is 30. This makes me even more disappointed,14
Rajasthan management : let's drop Rajpoot and buy him for multiple crores next year !!,8
"It's natural for people to compare Iyer with SKY and Pant with Kishan because, ummm, they're fighting for the same spot? I don't see how it's a problem, ideally it should be pushing everyone to be performing better. 

IMO SKY has always been a better T20 batsman than Iyer. Make no mistake, Iyer is a great ODI batsman but he is simply not a very good T20 batsman, not at this stage in his career at least. He is too similar to Kohli and lord do India have a fuck load of anchors in the team already, don't need one more.",6
SKY is okay but have you seen PADDIKAL?,1
[deleted],2
Suryakumar yadav is so silky and talented. It makes you realize how much talent there has been in the past decade for Indian batting if he has been nowhere near the international team. If he were playing 5 years earlier I bet he could have walked into the team.,11
"Lord Tewatia and Buttler, please spare us 🙏",3

10. Tyagi

11. Unadkat/V.Aaron",3
Come on kishan get out. Wanna see tiwary jiggle down to the pitch,2
[deleted],43
Imagine how much better RR would've been if they'd spent money on one good Indian quick,9
Tewatia would probably get around 10 cr in the mega auction if he keeps this up,5
That was a bravo-sque mistimed insideout shot.,3
Genuinely mental how Jof is the only capable bowler for RR,11
SKY thrives under pressure,2
Tewatia gives his 100% everytime. Madlad.,5
Tewatia would have abused the fuck outta the fielder if he was the bowler lol,10
Tewatia should get yelled at now,7
I want SKY to play till death overs only to witness his 360° shots,3
Khudko gali de,6
"I remember SKY doing well for KKR and Rana for us, and then we swapped these 2 and SKY has only done better!",10
"Quick gopal, yell at tewatia",4
The LORD wants to bat today,3
"No disrespect to Kohli, but he should take notes from SKY on how to be positively agressive",7
SKY not trying hard yet striking at 150+ while Ishan trying to cunt every ball just going at 100.,2
"SKY should be in the India T20 lineup against Australia. And, given a long rope at the no 4 spot.",5
Not looking good for RR. Lord dropped,5
Lmao Tewatia ab nahi chillayega,10
Tewatia would abuse the fielder if that was dropped off his bowling.,14
"When the Lord drops you, you must be destined for greater things",7
Is it for me or for everyone that ms Dhoni's post match presentation looks lengthy. Like others speak less when compared to him,8
"Ishan needs to be given some time. And India needs to come to grips with the fact that people can debut for the national team in their mid-20s, even late-20s. We need a better system for selection though because the current way is not suitable for the talent pool.",7
SKY is playing beautifully today.,3
Surya hai to jaan hai.,3
If someone dropped that off Tewatia he'd be going off at them lmao,7
MI reaching for the SKY,5
that jofra wicket made me believe we had a chance against the most OP team ever.. I’m a clown,8
"That was a solid effort tbh and Samson and Shreyas Gopal applauded it but if Tewatia was bowling and someone missed it,

He'd go full maa-behen and absolutely ape shit.",37
nerf mumbai ffs,4
MI are relentless,8
"Ah, just euthanize us",9
We always talk of bowlers setting up batters. This time SKY set up the bowler. Kept hitting it wide again and again to open up the straight shot for 4. Super stuff.,8
"As a DC fan who know what Sky can do. Good Luck RR, FIght for NRR",7
Watch csk get sky next auction as a replacement for raina,-7

Hamilton 92 in other news!,3
Umpires Hair + Shimrons Booty  = From back view Boys will hit,10
Good domestic Indian batsman make Kohli and Rohit look so pedestrian in how they play spin.,69
RR has no off spinner and they banked on gopal which didn't work out. Terrible season for them overall.,7
Let's go Kishan time to go bonkers!,6
Ishan may get out soon,5
Swann is a riot,3
"Last year almost the same time, Rohit pulled a hamstring in the t20 series against NZ, and couldn't play the test or ODI, now again before our Australia series.. hope he gets fitter soon,.maybe lose some weight or the last few years of his career will be more injury plagued",6
The nerves on this guy to come front foot for lords ball,4
Lol. Ishan must have tried atleast 20 times to cunt that ball without success,6
Dugout commentary is just something else altogether.,7
Can someone please tag me when RR decide to get back into the game?,6
"Aunty in red Dancing, thoda rest kar lijiye varna RIP ho jayenge.",1
"Markande could have been a better option here instead of Rajpoot, considering how Varun absolutely destroyed us",1
Swann doing an Attenborough. What can't this man do?,5
David Attenborough mimicry on Dugout is giving me life.,3
Lmao swanny now doing a David Attenborough impression,2
"Every time a teammate bowls shit, Jofra adds another link to his chains. Soon he may not be able to walk under the weight of gold.",6
Lmao Swanny comparing Gopal's bowling pitchmap to Global warming,3

Good man Swanny educating everyone on climate change,3
"TBF this MI team can work on autopilot without a captain. Everyone does know their roles well.

 It's the crunch situations like bringing Bumrah in 12-13th to break a good stand in where Rohit has shined compared to other IPL captains when facing similar situations.",14
Rajpoot and Tyagi will undo all the work done by Archer,3
"Honestly I don’t see how Mumbai can be stopped, they are the perfect well oiled machine of a team. Even when they lose, they make the opposition play super overs to defeat them",7

I am pretty sure RR fans dread Surya more than Rohit. Always steps up against them,5
Tewatia brought down to earth,2
Who is that lady in Kelviinnn ad,3
"If rr wins ipl by mistake, who will be the major culprit in making that happen",6
I think the people who lost too much money on Dream 11 but can't pay it are made to dance on the virtual guest box to humiliate them. It serves as a hall of shame.,10
[deleted],4
Mumbai look invincible.,4
Yo what can they do if the few times induce complete miscues from MI's batsmen it doesn't go to hand,3
Why did RR let Gowtham go ? He is a good enough spinner and handy with the bat in the lower oder.,3
These batsmen are showing that the domestic system in India is pretty strong. Just need to figure out how to bridge the gap to international cricket.,9
More Yorkers like that pls Tyagi,3
"Good boundary. Checked the shot last second and placed it rather than cunt it.

Keep your head on Kishan!",3
"What i find most interesting about MI is that there is hardly some ""anchor"" player just living on with 110 SR role throughout the season irrespective of situation

The batting is deep enough that they don't need to slow down most of the time which keeps them mentally superior while batting",5
His runs might say something else but Kishan seems to be really struggling.,5
sanju needs to drop off this list if he’s not going to do it again,3
Fuck you MI you perfect bastards.,8
"Compared to Surya, deewana Kishan is playing on completely different wicket",13
Another edge,2
Ishan 'I see I hit' Kishan,6
"Sky has hit same number of boundaries as Ishan and both have scored similar number of  runs but Sky has a lot better SR

Ishan has a problem rotating strike, i believe",5
Can Ishan play on already,3
Ishan man what is this timing,3
Jofra u beauty,2
"What a fucking catch, Archer is too precious",3
ALL HAIL OUR PROPHET JOFRADAMUS,3
Archer is everywhere,7
Archer has to do everything in this team. Amazing catch.,11
What a catch,5
"RR, for the love of God and cricket, oen with Sanju and Uthappa. Leave Stokes where he's good at. Ffs",8
Wow.,2
"Archer: fine, I'll do it by myself",19
Holy faaaak Archer!!,9
What a fucking catch? Can't complain,5
"Damn son

Didn't know Jof could do that

Brilliant catch",8

Archer turning up for RR again,3
This is how a real lord fields stupid twatia,3

Wow. No Archer. You can’t do that,9
JOFRA MVP IPL 2020 CONFIRM,7

Lol Archer can do nothing wrong. Dude might score a century tonight.,10
jofra I would like to be your lawfully wedded wife please,11
"Jofra misjudged that

Good catch tho",2
An evenly matched MI vs Archer match.,7
That was similar to Jadeja's catch in that New Zealand series.,4
"**10.4** Kartik Tyagi to Ishan Kishan, OUT, **one-handed pluck from Jofra at third man** Tyagi has his head in his hands. **90-2**

Ishan Kishan c Archer b Kartik Tyagi 37 (36b 4x4 1x6) SR: 102.77",3
Jofra MVP this season even if RR ends up last on Table.,6
"RR is going to loose this match by atleast 50 runs, like last MI vs RR match. Except Jofra archer no other bowler has made any big impact.",5
YOU CANNOT DO THAT JOFRA ARCHER,6

Anyone come back from F1?,3
Nobody could believe that Jofra would catch that,5

Rajasthan 'Archer' Royals...,6

Kishan's gonna be a proper moody git for the rest of the game lmao,1
"It seems like mi, dc, rcb, kkr are going to playoffs. Wonder how the virgins do against the polygamists",3
Archer's back really hurting badd having to carry RR like this.,5
just rename the franchise to rajasthan archers. or jofra royals. I don’t care. put some respect on this man’s name,12

Somebody find the relevant jofra tweet for this.",3
So nonchalant,2
Archer did a Ben Stokes.,1
What a fuckin catch,3
Just wow,2
Woah Archer.,4
Time for some Tiwary magic,1
Everyone was surprised.,1
Absolute gold reactions from others,2
That was special.,1
This happens routinely in the IPL now. This is the highest standard of t20 cricket there is.,2
“Only a West Indian can do that.”- Ian Bishop,12
"RR needs to spend their auction money on Archer, and cloning technology to make 10 more Archers (and make them in India, so that they aren't overseas)",5
"Wtf Archer.

Mans can drop dollies.. and then does that. INSANE CATCH.",9
"Rr doesn""t deserve Jofra.",7
If Tewatia is Lord then Jof is God. Such a cool mother fucker.,5
Expect no twos Tiwary,2
"Unfortunately a flurry of wickets only brings Pollard and the Pandyas to the crease. Heck, I’m fairly sure that Pattinson and Boult could tonk our bowlers.",13
Jofra has been the best investment RR has made in years.,12
Holy shit. Some of the fielding this IPL has been insane.,4
Tyagi reaction looks like archer dropped the ball intentionally,5
Jofra Royal and 10 peasants,18
Saurabh Tiwari to management: I will take 50 lakh less but I want 3 buffets in a day,11

God! Tiwari seems to have added some more weight this IPL,7
Lol Stokes knows whatsup,6
"Man. I know it's textbook to send Saurabh Tiwary right now, but I want to see Pollard ASAP",7
Tiwari's role should be 30(12),8
[deleted],12
Big chungus on crease,7
Yeah he misjudged that a bit initially but man the athleticism needed for that recovery is crazy. Jofra is a true athlete.,9
Archer's impressed with the bowling and fielding so far today. Won't be surprised if he beats us around when he comes to bat. He's that fucking good.,12
Chonker,4
Csk gonna bid for S Tiwary in next auction,7
If RR didn't have archer they would be at the bottom of the table.,3
Saurabh Tiwary looks like hes had an excellent feeding season after his 4 month hibernation in a cave.,4
Archie can easily dunk the basket ball.,3
I was pretty surprised why would KKR let go such talented player like Sky?!!,2
">Tum log clap karmna band karo aur khelna chalko karo BC

- Archer to RR.",3
Rohit Sharma is out because Saurabh Tiwary ate him.,17
How tf did Archer remain so calm and nonchalant after catching that.,3
"Very good over, and even though it was Archer’s catch which was sensational Tyagi started nailing the Yorkers. Hopefully the wicket gives him confidence.",2
We're all Kartik Tyagi looking at that Jofra catch,6
I think Pollard should have come instead of Tiwary.,3
"Like Stokes in the first world cup game, misjudged but recovered spectacularly. What a cricketer he is.",6
"Ok, AJIO makes some of the best ads on TV....",2
Ishan Kishan worst is Shubman Gills best. *Crying meme*,7
"Bish with the Windies claim!

Cheeky.",2
"Saurabh Tiwary is good and all but considering Hardik and Pollard to follow, RR could try tightening the screws trying to keep these two as quiet as possible",4
"This stadium looks so weird from up above. There is all this grass in the ground, but there is desert just outside it. Like not away on the horizon, but right where the grass ends. Makes me thing the upkeep must be really high to keep that grass alive.",5
Big chungus out to bat,6
"Danny Morrison saying only a West Indian can do that in response to Archer's catch

Spicy",4
What a chonker tiwari is,8
Saurabh Tiwary looks like he ate whoever he was quarantined with,11
Blessing in disguise for MI for Kishan to go. Hope Tiwary grabs this opportunity.,8
Tiwary is cultivating mass,7
Saurabh Tiwary looks like someone who could be a henchman in Munna Bhaiya's gang in Mirzapur lmao.,7
Incoming why doesn't Tiwary just eat the other cricketers comments.,11
Why isnt Rohit playing?,3
Thiccwary,2
Holy fuck what a catch....,3
"Jofra Archer doing batting fielding bowling for RR

Rest of RR : Yeh tum karlo mai Dream 11 mei team bana leta hu",6
Tiwary was in the bodyguard business after his initial stint in the IPL?,5
How did Inzamam come out of retirement to play for MI,6
"*ahem*

What an absolute **UNIT**",5
/r/chonkers,2
That looked like a no ball almost to me...,1
Tiwary has lost some weight since beginning of IPL. Props to him.,2
"The foreign contingent of MI is so strong, bit lacking in the indian reserves tho",1

"Rumours are Rohit's injured due to a lack of vada pav

With all due respect to Tiwary’s talent he may hinder MI from taking the 2s,4
I want 100 sr kishan instead of 40 sr tiwary,2
Tiwary bagged a fat contract from CEAT for the tyre around his belly.,11
How can MI not be even a bit complacent after being at the top? Why is it necessary to be so ruthless every fuckin game?,13
Don’t waste balls pls.,2

Tiwary hasn't usually wasted any balls when he's come out to bat. Hope today is the same.,3
No 2s possible with Saurabh Biryani,-1
This motu wasting precious balls here.,-1
RR has pulled back the game,6
Tiwary is like the Switzerland of cricket. Just there. For no one. Against no one. Resurfaces sometimes on some occasions.,9
No time to settle in Tiwary.. have a go or if not keep giving the strike to SKY.,4

"**12.2** Gopal to Yadav, OUT, **lofted straight to long-off.** SKY is playing this loft off the back foot, because he wants to make room to go from in to out and over extra cover. But he's managed to lift this full ball from middle stump straight into Stokes' hands **95-3**

"Guys, a question.. The people in hotstar chat, are they intentionally typing nonsense, grammatically shocking sentences or they genuinely type that way?",6
Two big men in the middle now,3
I might be wrong but most of MI players don't look like they do kohli level of training in the gym or just fitness freaks... But they still manage to dominate the IPL.. In a world where there's constant talk about rigorous fitness regime teams like MI and CSK(barring this season) have shown that skills are more important... Look at pollard..

Damn look at the chonknation at the crease,3
Ben Stokes dead,4
Polly ffs don't give me a heart attack,4

Mi have this in the bag tbh. Pitch looks hard to bat on and they are 100+ already,2
"Saurabh Tiwary and Kohli were from 2008 under 19 squad. Tiwary was lean that time, Kohli was chubby. Now look at the difference. Not body shaming but I don't think so athletes should look like that.

Pollard going all out from the beginning noice,3
"Ok Tiwary .... gonna need you to step up here. Can't be tuk tuking in T20s like this. Score runs or get out and let Hardik, Pollard and Krunal close this match.",7
MI in IPL is like Australia of the early 2000's this is just unfair,9
Ben Stokes would’ve caught that,5
Ben stokes has done nothing this IPL.,1
Tewatia and gopal both are in opposite end of spectrum oof,3
"Apparently 4(8) put pressure on sky. 

Sky just wanted to hit a boundary and he didn’t execute it well and he got out. 8 balls ain’t building pressure and it shouldn’t, it’s not even a chase",7
Pandya should have come in when Ishan got out to keep the strike rate up. Also would have saved the unnecessary pressure on SKY,2
That tummy display above the boundary line lol,2
"Wow, pollard defended that beautifully",3
"For a moment thought Ben Stokes went in coma 

And then finally the hands came up to clap lol",3
The only reason Tiwary is in the team is because he probably makes the meanest vadapavs,4
Aate hi pelna shuru lmao,3
Pollard would've caught that,7
A huge units batting for Mumbai!!!,2
lmao google's live probability of RR winning dropped by 10 percentage points just because Pollard walked onto the field,3

Yeah bitxhes,1
Daddy pollard is gone!!!,2
Good ball that,5
Gopal you beauty 😍😍😍😍,5
It's that Jofra catch. Everyone's got the belief now.,10
Pollard realized this was RR not KXIP,10
COLLAPSE!,3
Wtf was Pollard pirouetting on the bat😂,4
Fuck ... We wasted a potential 180,6
No need to catch that...,1
[deleted],9
Can't wait for you guys to blame Tiwari for Pollards wicket,10
"Let me guess

That was Tiwary's fault as well right?",15
Never take potty break when you have to bat - Rayudu and polly,5
"Pollard took this lightly. 

Wasn't at all expecting the googly",11
"Imagine seeing your team lose two wickets in an over, and then realise neither is Saurabh Tiwary",19
MI shitting the bed against lower teams.. first KXIP now RR..,2
"MI ki batting ka saara bhaar ab Saurabh Tiwary ke pet pe hai....

"gopal is on it atm, a beauty",2

Looks like pollard is weak to specific spin deliveries.,3

Pollard average dropped from 200 to 100,9
Pandya plz save,4
Two wickets in this over. Momentum has swung. Shows how things change in a T20.,2
Tailor made situation for Hardik. Need some runs under his belt desperately.,5
Shows u how important fielding is. We looked set for 200 when Surya and Kishan were together. That catch just changed the tide.,6
Hardik out after 19(18),3
Why tf we lose against meme teams :(,5
"If I ever came across Saurabh Tiwary and Kieron Pollard in a dark alley,

As soon as I turned off the TV RR picked 3 quick wickets. So now I'm gonna follow the remainder of the match on cricbuzz. You're welcome,5
Waah. Finally some breathing for RR,3
"RR: gets Pollard
MI: Sends Padya
RR: For fucks sake",10
Hardik Pandya 60(25) incoming.,5

Tiwary to play Mahishesque innings?,2

Hardik and Saurabh are the opposites of the ipl body spectrum lmao,8
please win MI,1
"Tiwary's been in for 8 balls. He's playing himself in while the guy at the other end was doing well.

SKY's wicket wasn't his fault and neither was Pollard's.

These are professional cricketers batting in the first innings of a match. They don't instantly shit the bed after their partner plays 2 dots.",3
Love Machine fuckboi is here❣️,4
Samsonesque innings from Pollard,3
Gopal dancing like butterfly on boundary,1
"Why is Gopal making eyes at Pollard after getting him out? Celebrate with your team mates don’t embarrass yourself by giving it to a guy who has just got out. Hate when bowlers do that, be gracious in victory. Batsman will very rarely be smug to a bowler when they’ve tonked them for 6.",6
"4 wickets down

Pollard just got out 

And still have Pandya bros, ~~NCN~~ Pattinson, El Boulto left to bat

Edit : Fixed NCN not playing",2
Wtf MI,1
"I was about to type ""Imagine losing an opener early and not having a complete batting collapse"" and then wickets started tumbling. Sorry MI fans.",3
People are telling that all team are shit. They don't even understand that this year it was always going to be IPL for bowlers. Shit batting doesn't mean Shit team.,1
Gopal. I love you.,4
Are they playing Tiwari out of peer pressure?,3
RR playing superbly even with Tewatia only operating at 2% of his powers,3
"MI is gonna lose, RR is our boogey team",6
Gopal was secretly watching the dugout commentary,4
Motu and patlu on the crease /s,10
We need Hardick gone soon. Else he'll tonk the shit out of us at the death,5
Inb4 Rahul Chahar rips Rajastan apart,8

Saurabh Thicc,6
Tewatia no,4
Good job Tiwary👍🏽,6
Tiwari is like imma score match winning 31(30),9
Can't wait for peeps to diss tiwari for that four,7
No matter what form they are going through RR almost always turn into prime CSK when they see us.,13
Nice shot by Saurabh Tandoori!,8
Spinners seem to be more effective these days than the opening phases of IPL?,3
Ben Stokes turning up as the fielding all rounder,6
How amazing would it be to see MI lose to RR. It means all 3 top 3 teams lost to a weaker team.,4
S.Tiwary is still 5 years away to be eligible for csk selection.,45
That was a six,5
No Tiwari no matter how hard you try Virat's not taking you in the test team,15
What does Shreyas Gopal and Butler have against us man. Every fucking time.,9
r/cricket pressuring tiwari into hitting boundaries,10
"This might be good thing as it allows Hardik some time to build an innings here and boost his confidence. 

Feels like he hasn't had as much time in the middle as most of the others..",3
Cheeky lick of the lips,5
"Why is Tiwary trying to defend the ball, man just try to hit we have Krunal as well, Tiwary is no Pollard that he will catch up",2
"If I eat pav bhaji today, will CSK be out of playoffs?",8
Doesn't look like Polly will get to bat up the order now,2
"MI: Saurabh, no!
RR: Saurabh, yes!",2
"IS Saurabh Tiwary the most overweight cricketer in IPL? Someone like Pollard maybe heavier but thats attributed to his height, but you know what I mean?",3
Tewatia‘s pretty economical for a leggie ngl. And even on the days where he goes for 30 runs or more he picks up wickets,3
Once Pandya is settled he should just go hard and get points on the board instead of leaving it for the final four overs because 2 of those will be bowled by Archer.,3
I know everyone likes Mumbai but how good of a find is Gopal for RR. Barely anyone knew him in 2018's auction but now he's a first choice spinner for us.,8
[deleted],7
Wtf they didn't show replay of that. Scripted shit,5
Mi pls lose this match so that csk is out of the tournament. All other 6 teams also wants this.,7

"Saurabh ""yuvraj singh"" Tiwary",6
CSK fans wishing for MI to win. You don't see that often.,9
We all know that Tiwary will be the one who screws Rajastan over.,8
Saurabh= 10 hardiks,0
anyone else fearing a classic RR top order collapse in the next innings,10
Wasn't the boundary the previous over a six?,4
Yea cunt him tiwari,3

based on this thread no team buying rakheem cornwall is a crime,9
"MI should get 170 from here. Not a bad score, could have had a few more had Pollard and SKY not got out quickly one after the other.",7
I'll spare tiwary for everything....if he hits that altroz,24
RR turns into a combination of 2017 MI and 2011 CSK when playing against MI.,24
There are two Archer overs in the last 5. Not gonna be like other matches where MI scores 80 odd runs...,6
Is this the guy who had long hair and built so many good partnerships with Rayudu?,16
What is this wicket? Whats the par score?,1
Has anyone got a video for that archer catch?,2

Elon Musk should come and test the windows of Altroz,7
[deleted],1
With the always animated Pandya Bros in the team how the hell is MI at the top of FairPlay™ table,2
I think Pollard let Rohit know that he prefers batting above Hardik and immediately regretted it.,10
"MI fans, how does it feel to still believe that you all are comfortable enough even after losing 4 wickets at the end of 13th over?",11
Difficult for MI to get to 170+ with two overs of Archer remaining. Hardik needs to start smacking.,9
Is Ben not gonna bowl today?,2
Wait a sec.... wtf happened?? I thought mi will cross 200,3
That Boult's catch though ✨🙏,6
Jofra reaching for the stars with that brilliant catch,3
Guddu pandit to rescue MI out this muddle,12
Stokes had a similar catch too right?,1

2 overs of Tyagi - 18 runs

1 over of Rajpoot - 18 runs

50 runs is what they could get.",9
omg... what happened,2
If RR win this then my Dusshera will be mega lit.,3
They should show the field placement after every ball. Its add to the broadcast.,2
I’m surprised this wasn’t a big over,1
"Even 2 overs of Jofra left smh, will take even 170 from here",2
"Damn, the dugout having a real fight.",6
Man Tiwary can really run fast for being  India's Inzamam,5
150 looking difficult lol,2
"Wanna know how Smith picks the least worst among Unadkat, Rajput and Aaron to play each matchday",6
I'd rather the irresponsible Hardik and Pant which tonked bowlers all over the park than the shitshow we are getting this year from the 2 of them.,10
More like Fuddu Pandit 😓,2
That was wide  but boy is so thicc.,5
Tyagi is from the batch after Nagarkoti/Mavi/Porel right?,2
Ball fell short of the third man fielder because of the gravitational pull of Saurabh Tiwary. #LastJoke,10
Archer should ball 17th and 19th. Don't let em get in to the game. Tyagi's done super in this here 16th,4
Tiwary emulating Dhoni since start of his career. Long hair then Thala innings now.,14
You guys won't be laughing anymore when Saurabh hits his double ton after following the Brohit diet,6
One end of Abu Dhabi looks like a crashed flying saucer,4

Haha Tewatia drops again.,8
RR just win this bruh. From your close neighbours.,9
Lmao why are you guys panicking? Have you not seen Mi defend low targets like hundreds of times before.,9
Tewatia would have given every gaali by now if he was bowling,20
That's gonna cost RR,7
Lmao Tewatia getting his just desserts,10
Lord Tewatia's energy has disappeared into the thin Martian atmosphere,6
"Tyagi quick, yell at tewatia",10
Oh damn he had it,4
Lol cork and styris,5
Dugout could be 3 redditors watching the game together and bickering about everything besides the game.,16
Nagar-Mavi got so much hype however only Arsh-Tyagi have provided performances of substance,5
"I would rather bench James Pattinson, play Dhawal kulkarni and swap tiwari and lynn.",5
Finally Lord Tewatia proving that Gods can also do mistakes sometime.,6
"Oh yes obligatory Pandya drop, I don't think I have seen anyone drop catch of any batsman more than Hardik in last two seasons.",8
Now imagine if others drop 2 catches off Tewatia. He would have gone berserk,13
The Dugout banter is brilliant.,3
"He giveth, he taketh",4
If anyone else was fielding like Tewatia today he'd have called their grandma a cunt by now,12
Had there been someone else missing that catch for tewatia he would have launched a verbal assault,5
Fuck tewatia,2
He's that fixer from Lagaan. Has taken money from motabhai,9
Someone scream at Tewatia that's a nasty drop,14
They sent him out lol.,7
Amazing placement /s,6
Can anyone tell me where can I watch the dugout?,3
did pandya just dab in that dream 11 ad,8
Tewatia screams at other players when they drop catches off his bowling. Look at him now after dropping two himself,10

Why is that fortunate? Looked like a fine stroke,1
Tewatia rather make some money on the side because this shit team cannot win without him.,5
Tiwary's tattoo on right forearm has warrior written on it?,1

Rajpoot peaked when he got Tendulkar out.,3
"Anyways, how Tiwary got heavy? Lockdown eating, depression or some other disorder? He almost doubled up in a year, if I'm right.",4
Fuccboi and thiccboi name a better duo,13
Rajpoot genuinely looks like a case of spot fixing. At least Unadkat  leaked runs bowling standard deliveries,10
Vada pav ftw,3
Hardik likes the look of Rajpoof,4
"Dread it, run from it, but Mumbai batting comes alive in the death Overs",13
"The way even Saurabh Tiwary can smash Jofra makes me think there's seriously something amazing with the MI support staff. The more I see MI, the more I think even Deepak Hooda would've been a good finisher if he started with MI.",8

LOL goodnight RR.. no way they're gonna chase down 180+ against Bumrah / Bolt,1
"Holy shit, Pandu is killing it",3
Holy smokes,2
"Guys this is my logic behind why MI are undefeatable?

Because-
1.They don't let the Run Rate down in any situation.

2.They have Pollard who can score runs against any opponent any situation.He can bowl and huge experience of T 20

3.2 proper all-rounders who can bat and bowl and both Indians.

4.With Bumrah and Krunal bowling tight overs so opponent have 12 overs only where can score some easy runs.

5.They are fucking MI they are like King Midas who ever they touch (give a chance to play) turns fucking gold !",10
Rajpoot fucker,8
Am I the only one who is missing our eternal superhero and sex symbol that is his holiness Shri Stuart Binny? This IPL doesn't feel the same without him.,14

"Okay Pandya slaughtering Rajpoot was pretty predictable

Iirc i saw that when rajpoot played for kkr",11
Pie bowler,2
Rajpoot lol,7
Dreadful bowling,7
Unadkat only bowls bad overs at death. Rajpoot bowls bad everywhere.,11
"HALF CENTURY RAJPOOT !!!
YOU BEAUTY!!!",7
Fucking Tewatia and Rajpoot,3
"If Saurabh gets selects for next match, MI should advertise - 


zameen hil jaayegi, dharti kaanp uthegi...jab Saurabh crease pe utrega...",-2
I LOVE HARDIK. 💕,2
I’m just laughing now I’m so unfazed by all of this,4
RR have bottled this ffs,5
The Dhoni jersey failed,7
... keep bowling full toss's during death overs,5
Pandya 🔥🔥🙏🙏,2
"60 of 24 for Rajput,",6
Rajpoot gone for 60,3
60 for Rajpoot bc. There’s no way MI aren’t winning this year either.,2
Rajpoot and tewatia blew it for RR,5
Rajpoot carrying on the proud tradition of unadkat. RR gonna buy him for 25cr next year... watch,9
Three full tosses in that over. All 6s.,3
Big Harddick energy!!,2
60 up for Rajpoot,7
Need Unadkat right now.,3
Brilliant Hat trick of sixes by F U C Cboi,5
I guess this is what happens when Rajpoot bowls more than 1 over,9
Love you Rajpoot ❤,4
"Hardik is brilliant when he's batting like this

I love Pandya",3
Damn rajpoot is on the verge of crying..,7
27 run over yikes,3
"I swear I'm so done with IPL. It's like a tournament for 2nd, MI is fucking untouchable. Kinda like Mercedes in F1",13
So even Hardik is in form now. Just give MI the trophy already.,7
Why these low full tosses bro 😂😂😂,5
Hardik: aaj main karke aaya,6
How can you bowl like this in the 18th over Jesus,5
"Rajpoot you beauty 

\--Ambani",3
Fucc boi fucking,3
" पाऊस पडतोय  Sixes!

is this correct for Its raining Sixes?!",4
50 for Rajpoot,4
And 4. Rajpoot scoring 60 for MI,2
Hardik will go down if not as the best all-rounders but at the least as one of the best limited over batters,3
Hardik fucking Rajchoot #YeaBoi,4
Looks like Rajpoot has still not lost the KXIP touch,10
Aaj karke aaya hai,3
I'd have stopped bowling rajpoot after 2nd and given stokes some if he's fit,4
60 runs in 4 overs. He should audition for RCB depth bowling.,16
Is this the worst figures this year?,4
Rajpoot 4-0-60-0 lmao,3
[kar ke aaya sounds intensifies],3
"*slurp *slurp *slurp arghh yeahhh dadyy love me dadyyy, Go Pandya",2
rajpoot pure shit,2
Fuck I have rajpoot captain of my Dream11. Was worth a throw at the stumps I suppose lol,8
highest scorer from RR:- Ankit Rajpoot 60(24),9
Good innings by rajpoot. 60 in 24 is insane,10
Pathetic bowling by Ankit Rajpoot,8
Bhenchod rajpoot.,3
Brilliant 60(24) from Rajpoot,17
please disband mi,8
Unironically bring back Unadkat,7
Rajpoot is bowling himself out of a contract,8
"Fuck you Rajpoot, nothing else, just fuck you",8
Tu Rajpoot nahi tu Das hai.,3
Partnership: 64(30),5
Mumbai out here knocking out teams one by one even without Hitman as captain,4
"If it was T16 instead of T20, RR would have been at the top of the table by now",8
Unadkut was better?,3
RR not missing Unadkat,4
Fuccboi ftw!!!,3
"First ipl season I've watched, just typical of me to pick the shittest team to support.",3
I knew Hardik is gonna fuck RR over when Tewatia dropped him,3
Thala curse ❌,2
Fastest 60 runs by Rajpoot.,5
Rajpoot... Just wow,4
Shit. We're only watching this IPL to see MI win it in the end.,10
"That dropped catch finished the game for RR. Lord taketh, Lord giveth",5
wtf. Get Akash Singh in. Was promising in the U19 WC. Can't be worse than Rajpoot,7
If De Cock doesn't get you hardik will,10
Thanks Rajpoot! But wtf were you planning to do here?,6
I hate this team,8
Honestly don't see how Rohit gets back in this MI team.,31
That was village cricket bowling,6
Why did t stokes bowl?,2
Now RR will buy Rajput for 9 cr next auction,4
More like Rajpoop,2
MI setting it up nicely for a Tewatia storm.,7
Earlier it was unadkat and now ankit rajpoot. RR still not able find a decent death bowlers.,3
~~Rajpoot~~ Rajchoot,4
I don't understand why they have to bowl rajpoot ? Couldn't Stokes bowl that over?,2
HARD DICK IN FORMMMM,2
"Brainless bowling, back to back Fulltosses",0
Ambani definitely paid him or why would he bowl full tosses,-3
Next mega Auction only 3 players should be allowed to retain. No RTM.,1
Absolute pies,3
Tiwari injured? :(,2
Rajasthan brought this upon themselves. Dropped Pandya. And that Tewatia drop was catchable.,3
this is really shit bowling,3
Someone brought up sambar biryani to eat. But I think sambar biryani topped with some churma completes the meal.,2
Why is Ankit Rajpoot,5
"In the next mega auction, Rajasthan should get rid of everyone except Archer and Tewatia.",6
Pandya's innings for the season incoming?,1
Rajpoot in his mind: *usne mera kar liya*,3
Mumbai has built team smartly.,6
Rajpoo more like,1
Motabhai paying rajpoot enough to deliver those pies. Hail capitalism!,4
How does MI always manage to do this?,7
Rapjoot making sure RR don't miss Unadkat. What a team player.,3
"Hmmm all my full tosses are going for 6’s

Wonder  what ball i should  go for next ?

Ofc a full toss ,fuckin brain dead mate eh ?",8
Lol 3 full tosses and one in the slot,3
Rajpoot.. latest graduate of the Dinda Academy of Bowling,1
There are bad spells and then there is Ankit Rajpoot's spell.,6
Choosing between rajpoot and unadkat is deciding if u want to concede 60 runs or 60 runs.,10
Rajppot looks like he's about to cry...,7
Some relief for the pink boys,4
yeah well now what,2
Guddu Pandit out...yess....,2
[deleted],6
Tiwari ji gone,2
"LORD Ankit Rajpoot this season:

Bowling avg: 99.50

Economy rate: 11.70",16
Why would you not bowl your worst bowler in the 20th over is beyond me lol,6
[deleted],12
Tiwary did well.. don't troll him,15
Fuck this is incredible from Rajpoot. 4 full tosses.,10
Thats 15-20 less run right there,5
Why even bother Jofra? Your team will screw you anyway.,12
Poor Archer has to do everything,12
Pollard and Hardik should be banned from T20s. Please.,7
Chonkyboi played his part,5
They still have a batsman. SMH.,2
Chad Archer is bacc,5
so this is what it feels like when i dont keep any hope of winning,6
pandya on both ends now.,6
"**18.1** Archer to Tiwary, OUT, **taken at long-on.** **165-5**

SS Tiwary c Stokes b Archer 34 (25b 4x4 1x6) SR: 136.00",1
Praying to cricket gods that Curran turns into a Pandya in the future,5
Nice innings from Saurabh.,3
Was Rajpoot crying?,5
love Machine tiwari holed out,2
Archie is the most badass cricketer.,6
Rajpoot was an imposter. 1 Unadkat remains.,26
"Ankit Rajpoot probably has a new record for most expensive figures, 0-60.",19
All the Games Tiwari played. He did really good.,8
Tiwary played a decent inning nevertheless. Perhaps treated him too harshly in the beginning....,6
"Another solid cameo Surabh! 

Good stuff. Fuck the haters.",7
-Laughs in Unadkat,5
MI team is full of Mirzapur characters,5
Why is MI even playing? They don't need the money. Too op,13
"This isn't exceptional batting. This is just exceptionally shit bowling. And it hasn't happened for the first time. About time bowleds like Rajpoot, Deshpande, Thakur, Siraj, Avesh stopped getting bumper IPL contracts.",5
"It was bound to happen, he hit Archer for a six",7
At this point Buttler shld bowl atleast he won't give 3 fulltosses in 18th over,2
Sourabh Tiwari reminds me of original bassist of Arctic Monkeys,6
Majal hai Tiwari ki ke woh 35 ke uper score banaye. Good hand played tho.,5
Saurabh tiwary saying Ben Stokes in his mind,1
Can Jofra force himself out of the team the same way Dhawan did? Go to MI buddy. You deserve it,12
Pandu bros together,1
Did that guy just call Pant 'Golu'?,4
I was thinking 200 but Tiwari has thrown away wicket.,2
RR has just bowled 6 consecutive full tosses.,5
None of the Indian players are useful in this RR match,2
Don't worry paltan. Brothers of Destruction incoming.,5
1/3 of runs came from Rajpoot. Absolutely shat on everyone else's efforts,8
Why did they go for Rajpoot and not Stokes? Stokes as an opener is the most braindead strategy ever by Smith,7
2 brothers at the crease!!!,8
And this is how MI becomes the first team to qualify,14
This is second match RR is losing because of  Tewatia,4
Amazing how Hardik has so much power with his lean figure and Tiwary needs to pull power from the dark dimension to get out past the inner circle,16
"KPandya is laughably inept against pure pace 
 
They need to somehow get 10 in this over",3
I really hope that Rajpoot is doing spot fixing. The lack of talent is heart breaking,8
Archer will break his back by the end of this ipl for the hardcore carrying he has done,16
I just realized the match is in Abu dhabi and not Sharjah  smh,9
Super Pandya Bros🔥🔥,7
Only SRH and RR can find ways to fuck up a game.,8
If Stokes opens today instead of Butler that’s game over for RR even before they start their chase,8
My man Rajpoot in this IPL has a bowling Average of 99.50 only second to Bradman's 99.54 (batting average),120
Battle of the WIs.,7
No point in trying a yorker against hardik. Hard length generally with the yorker as a surprise. Nonsensical bowling there,2
Archie playing for England is a very big loss for WI.,7
Whats with motavai Tshirt not being tucked in?,7
[Rajpoot after bowling a full toss which gets hit for a six](https://i.imgur.com/VpxlRra.jpg),12
"Been saying for a few games now to just bin off Rajpoot and Unadkat, pick an extra batsman and Stokes, you're gonna have to bowl pal, or you can get dropped as well!",9
"TIwary batted only thrice so far if I am not wrong 42 (31), 21 (13)  and 34 (25) , he's doing good for number 4",44
RR better show some fight with the bat,8
RR should play Akash Singh next match let's test him out Unadkat Rajpoot are gone case.,5
I still remember Rayudu and Tiwari wreaking havoc in the first IPL we got to finals and lost,63
Wow Pandya is amazing,5
I am fine with an 8 run over please. Don't lose another wicket,6
I85 would be nice,4
Tewatia’s drop proving to be game changer,11
"I read some article that they aren't planning to take Pandya to Australia because he doesn't bowl much. Buddies, we need him as a finisher even if he doesn't bowl.",8
"If you want to support a team and want to watch IPL on easier difficulty just support MI. They never disappoint. 

One or the other player will just rise to the occasion and play a good innings.",30
Saurabh Tiwary has actually done really well,11
Lets be real. RR ain't chasing this. How many do we think they'll get? I say 120-130,5
I hope RR don't fuck up with the batting order. JBL to open please. PLEASE!!!,5
I am waiting for the last over now,8
IPL seems shady to me when I see spells like Ankit Rajpoot's. How do you keep giving him 4 overs when he's getting hit that bad?,-5
Smith had 2 fifties in 2 matches as an opener this season. None since then since he started playing as 2013 Test match No 5 Smith. If he doesn't promote himself up the order and Stokes at 5 where  Stokes bats the best (swap between him and Stokes) and RR do not make it to playoffs Smith will not get a bid next IPL.,5
Should’ve been a wide. Square leg umpire is cheating.,7
Corky always sounds a bit cranky.,6
180 is still on the cards.. even 190,11
What an over by Archer.,15
"Hardik vs Jofra in IPL 
26 balls 
32 runs 
Two dismissals 
SR 123 Source - Cricbuzz",6
Buttler big innings incoming today,12
"wait who’s bowling the last over?

you know what, don’t answer that",5
"I still think SRH is shit but atleast we got the tactics right. RR, CSK and KKR have been terrible in that department.",5
Hardik with west indian link with archer and bro link with krunal,7
Those super charged strikers stats from Mumbai are insane,4
Just 3 runs off it. GG Jof. Hardik has to go nuts here,9
Archer redeeming the fucked up over by rajpoot,18
Ankit Rajpoop undoing all the gains from the middle overs squeeze in 6 balls,7
Almost 170 is up which could be considered as par score for RR on this ground,4
Buttler opens,9
Gulshan Grover on strike,4
Getting another quality bowler should be number 1 priority for RR,5
Can MI get to 190?,1
I think Stokes is injured and can’t run. Hence he’s opening and trying to hit as much as he possibly can,2
Rajasthan still in this. Mumbai only exploded in the death overs against punjab last sunday night and the bottom of the table team fought back.,3
Krunal batting and bowling is so ugly to watch,4
Come on Tyagi,3
I'd back MI to win a T20 WC. In fact they'd be favourites,14
What's the point of having stokes if he can't be prefer over rajpoot or unadkat? Just give that space to David Miller. Lad didn't even get to play a bowl yet and got dropped.,6
If RR can win this they deserve to go to the play offs,1
How many runs was it in that Rajpoot over?,1
Rajput is the new Udatkat,5
"First Match ""Surely Aaron can't be this bad""

Next match ""Surely Rajpoot can't be this bad""

Next match ""Surely Unadkat can't be this bad""

And then the loop continues",17
How tall is Tyagi,6
I want Buttler to be the opner and Stokes to be the finisher today,5
Isnt it weird that RCB and MI are only going to play 13 matches this season? Wonder why RCB vs MI wont happen again,5
"Saurabh Tiwari should go to a team where he can regularly play for. He is really unlucky to be just a replacement player for MI. He is in good form and could have really proved himself in this season, with more number of opportunities in some other team.",11
20-30 runs jyada banao bhailog! Buttler will definitely come all guns firing...,3
"Hardik finally coming through big time. Now let's finish this innings with a closing knock Pandya bros!

Let's get to 185-190!",6
This team deserves to finish below csk imo,3
"Tbh unlike archer, a lot of rabada wickets are stats padding",6
yes 190 let’s go 🤩,6
I’m straight but I’d suck Pandya’s hard dik. Wow,15
"Yes, good strategy to bowl short with Pace to Hardik.",2
Only Pandya was not performing at his level now he's back dissolved this team,4
Am I the only one hearing the *Ching Ching* of Archers chain when he gets closer to the bowling stump mic?,5
Hardik ' Ruin Indian Pacer's careers' Pandya,7
How costly was that drop from Tewatia.,5
"Smith to Kartik: Howz my captaincy now?
Kartik: its still shit",3
"Archer be like ""Cheeee""",5
Archer is like WTF,9
Smugness level : Dick Pandya,3
"ahhh oh dadddyy give it to me dadyyy, what a BIG DICK six by fuccboi love machine",1
"Rajput is shit seriously shit.

Like the shittest shit. People have bad days, he has a bad life untill he redeems hinself sopn.",8
Dik has risen,2
[deleted],5
So close to the mega auction where Mumbai would’ve had to dismantle their team now they have another IPL to dominate 😂,6
"After seeing Tyagi getting hit for sixes,  even Joffra calling him BC.",4
"No matter what, MI always end up getting to 180+ when batting first",11
Stokes why not bowling,7
Hardik after eating vada pav,8
Kapow,3
"hardiks bat has that monster energy drink sticker, it so aptly suits him haha",3
Pandya being proud of pandya,3
Bowl the Yorker nah dude!,3
Ben stokes' batting isn't worth 12.5cr,3
This is hardiks role. If he plays like this he comes into the Indian team even if he doesn’t bowl I reckon,9
more daddy more,4
"CSK can do this too with pinch hitters down the order like Curran and Jadeja.

Though the slight inconvenience is that the rest of the batting is non existent most of the time",7
Hard dick magic,3
Hardik was having an iffy ipl finally some action,7
Is this guy for real?,3
Lord bless our batting line up.,8
I sincecierly hope RR loses all their games for leaving Miller to warm the bench,8
"If Lord doesn't redeem the dropped catch today, he loses his title. No more Lord Tewatia",7
How does hardik generate this much power with such a slender build ?,4
At least spare the kid Hardik please,8
Hardik doesn't even need lube to fuck Tyagi,5
Lol. Like taking candy from a 2 year old. Easy,6
MI deserve to win this year. Just look at this onslaught,9
Looks like MI is a better team without Sharma,8
Hard dick energy is spilling,6
Are Unadkat and Rajput only available pace bowling options after Tyagi and Archer in RR camp?,2
Who the hell fetches the ball from outside the stadium?,3
Jofra in prayer stance @ Tyagi,9
Now Only Rohit is yet to bat to his potential in this team.,14
must have ate the most delicious vada pav. wow.,9
Someone slap Tewatia for this lol,10
Will Rajpoot get a bid next IPL or was this the end of him in IPL,7
"Dread it. Run from it. Mumbai ""190"" Indians always arrives",16
Ian Bishop just jizzed,4
give me 195 daddy,3
"Why don't RR bowlers learn from Archer on how to bowl, it's a fucking shit show from RR pacers",2
😂😂😂😂😂,1
Disgraceful,1
What a knock.,1
HARDHIT TAKE THAT RR,2
"Lmao he's hardly middled anything today, and he's crossed 50",2
I’m gonna vomit,2
"Yo Pandya, let's see that 50 boi!! Aaj Kar hi daal.",3
It must feel so great to be an MI fan.,3
I feel bad for RR. With such a brilliant team on paper their execution has been fucking poor,2
Ok this is murder. Wow. What a finish.,3
Hardik got access to Brohit's personal Vadapav stall.,8
"Mi too op

No nerf plz",7
HARD DICK ENERGY,6
"54 (20)

Beast of an innings. WOW.",7
Magnificently garbage bowling. Nothing special about the batting.,0
Is Tewatia OK?,3
Hardik just became 40 inches in size.,6
Did anyone hear what sehwag said about rohit and tiwary ? Lmao im pretty sure he's reading this sub,6
So Pollard fails Hardik get's you,6
Next time better spend that 8 Cr in someone like Ishant rather than releasing Unadkat and buying him for 10 Cr again,4
arrhhh arhhhh oooo SIX,1
I hate hate hate tewatia right now,7
Dropped catch proving to be very costly.,14
**MI is too OP. Please nerf**,14
I almost smashplayed a track on repeat watching this.,2
lmao BLM??,9
If any batsman wants to make a comeback they should bat against shit bowlers of RR (ofc except archer),8
"This is more so poor bowling than good batting, idk why they’re gassing him up so much",6
[deleted],-12
"RR bowlers have gifted him a 50, just buffet bowling",11
Wtf i love hardik now,6
"Aww, Krunal is so proud of him 😭😭",10
I feel bad for Archer playing with mugs,10
MI team is stacked asf. Too OP,15
Hardik coming to form at the climax of the tournament.,6
50,2
20 ball 54 Fucking diabolical!,7
I love that hug so much.,5
Archer sending in a petition to BCCI to bowl all 20 overs,15
Daddy Polly is impressed!!,8
Holy effing lord,4
"How the hell did this happen? At one stage they were looking to get 200, 3-4wickets and it looked like yeah 150-160. But now, WOW!",6
"All of our regular top 6 batsmen have now scored a fifty (infact 60+ scores)

You can thank me for information.",10
What a cunting.,2
"I won't say that Tyagi is doing a terrible job, it's just Hardik is fully erect here",10
Pandya!!!!! I luv u,2
This is why MI is doing so well......different people step up in different matches,6
Wow... GOOD GOD . WOW .,3
"Honestly, stupid bowling. He hit the same wide Yorkers for boundaries almost all over.",9
Totally destroyed RR.,6
Mandatory 190 for MI,13
"I repeat

Just. Fucking. Ban. Hardik. And. Pollard. From. T20s.",63
"Fuck this ball

~signed hardik",12
Fucking hell MI is too OP. This ain't fair,18
Wait did one of the RR bowlers go for 60 runs!?,7
"Seriously, this is child abuse man",17
Byeeee RR 👋👋👋👋,2
lmao steve smith looks so fkn pissed hahahaha,6
That's got to be one of the fastest 50s this IPL,9
21 balls 60 runs. This guy is the real entertainment.,11
"Hello, ye I'd like to report a rape please",16
MADARCHOD I LOVE THIS TEAM 😭😭😭 ALWAYS GIVING ME REASONS TO SMILE,21
How the fuck this team crawls middle overs and still wheezes past 190™ is beyond my fucking imagination,11
Wait... 195? WTF? I'm MI fan and still in awe,3
Wow 27 from the over to finish,3
Ohhh papapapa 💦,4
Damn I thought 160 would be difficult. But here we are at 195,4
Pandya is love but seriously man Archer is op,3
"We back to Mumbai ""190"" indians?",3
27 runs again. 54 runs off 18th and 20th over,9
More runs in the last over than his combined previous 3,8
Start RR depression thread already,16
"In an Indian team full of accumulators, at least we have this dude",15
RR bowling outside of archer is embarrassing,4
Hardik showing the big D ⚡,2

"That was an expensive spell

DUNIYA HILA DENGE MUMBAI ROXXXXXXXXX,3
"That wasn't the best final over of bowling I've seen, I'll be honest.",3
Holy RIP Tyagi,3
What a way to finish an innings. Fantastic knock by hardik,3
"Inexperienced Indian bowler exists:

Hardik Pandya: I can milk you",13

FUCK ME IN THE ASS THIS IS SOME HARD DICK ALL RITE!!!!,9
"MI got 50+ in last two overs? I'm not even hiding it, I'm jealous of the MI lineup.",10
Wtf was that last over?! He should be arrested for that bowling!,6
MAN I LOVE THIS TEAM SO MUCH ♥️♥️♥️♥️,7

Well that's how you finish a match. India don't worry about finishers. This man is a fucking mauler.,11
This is how you bat in a t20,8
Literally anyone can captain this side and they'll win comfortably,8
Seriously these so called young Indian pacers are not even suitable for local club cricket. Itna pagalpan wow,3

60 in 21. JFC Hardik,8

Ok Trent it's time to get that inswing going now. Let's do this!",6
Ain't no indian batsman is as good as Hardhit when it comes to death over hitting. BRUTALITY !!!,10
I don't think RR's bowlers were shit today I think their captain is shit.,7
Honestly just play an extra batsman instead of Rajpoot,12

"Hardick ""Main RR ki le ke aya"" Pandya",9
The fielder who dropped Pandya needs to think on his sins,17
Poor RR bowlers.,7
"Archer bowling an over for 3 runs, in between those there was an over for 26 and another for 27. This dude deserves a better team.",13
How have RR thrown the game away in 15 minutes,7
Sehwag of all people criticising Rohit's fitness and calling him Vadapav is ironic and memeable!,14
Lord Tewatia gonna carry RR home,2
Poor bowling....you got to mix it up.. extremely difficult bowling to Pandya...but bowling only outside off stump 6/6...too predictable,15
Smith should have bowled himself instead of Rajpoot,6
Dina Academy Ankit Rajpoot ka swagat karti hai....,-5
Every other team in IPL be scared be very scared!!!,9
l miss Unadkat lmao,9
"Agreed it was good hitting,but this is very poor bowling, why can't they just bowl Yorker length, atleast attempt it once in the final over",8
MI will do a 2009 DD for sure,2
There's the cunt!,4
ultimate chad 285.71 SR,8
"Yeah Mumbai winning all of this

Yeah in the even year as well",9
My only cope for MI playing good is that these are the same people in the indian team lmao.,15
IPL performance does not translate to international performance because there is less likelyhood of braindead bowlers like Tyagi and Rajpoot.,13
"Ballers coulda learned from kxip’s superover balls by shami , imo balling side at fault for this",3
That took any hope RR had away. Disasterous bowling,7
Only watched the last over and... oh my god,5
"This batting line up is too deep, Rohit was out and even then Krunal barely got 3 balls to play, forget tailenders",8
penultimate archer over only going for 3 was incredible in retrospect,10
"Fucking hell, now hardik is also in form. The only out of form batter in MI is probably Rohit and you know he's just a vada pav away from a big innings too",62
"Damn 
 
~~64~~ 74 in last 4 and there's a 3 run over between that",19
"Even if Hardik cannot bowl, he should be in the Indian T20 squad against Aus for this reason....we need a good finisher",8
Somewhere Rajpoot is feeling better,8
"Unadkat be like, *Yeh to kuch bhi nahi, I can give 10 more*",8
MI team is like Ravan.,8
"As good as hardik is God like, RR bowling was freaking shit level. They have got no idea.",10
Not even even year will stop this MI,13
Fuccboi: Aaj mein karke aaya,6
Hardik dropped at 5... then goes 60(21). What a beauty!,14
MI casually gets 190 even when they lose 3 wickets for 10 runs in the middle overs. Too OP.,14
What a fucking flop,11
"So, that's about curtains for RR then.",4
For a second I thought Hardik Pandya was gonna do the *Black lives matter* thingy with Pollard . Thank the fuck he didn't. That would have been the ultimate cringe.,8
[deleted],5
As a csk fan i'm happy,3
And people say India doesn't have someone extremely explosive.,10
"Why did stokes not bowl and if he is having poor form with the bat and wants to open still performs poor, then why is he still playing? RR management should take all the blame terrible season, even worse than csk. Buttler and jofra deserv better team.",3
Honestly speaking I can bowl better than rajpoot.,11
"People talk about MI having the right template, but having your side filled with this kind of talent isn't a template, it's a blessing",5
How is Hardik so skinny yet so strong,5
HarDICK 8 off 9 to 60 off 21... was on viagra,8
"Tewatia giveth, Tewatia taketh",7
"Comeon we were destined to reach 180+ today 


I doubted a bit when we lost 3 quick wickets tho",3
We've seen murder on the ground. Whaaada match,4
You have to give it to MI. They are the only team that has come back from collapses this season. They are the best side this tournament.,6
"If you don't bowl Stokes, Miller is definitely the better batsmen of the two!",8
"*aaj mein kar ke aaya™, ask krunal, he was also there*",6
"So that's 1 of the top 2 slots done then. DC and RCB have identical fixtures for the remaining 3 games. Let's see who goes on to lose to MI in Q1, will be interesting",6
Techutiya has cost RR this match,8
MI just a juggernaut.,7
No that would've shattered Tyagi's confidence,6
"Regardless of the bowling, you have to commend Mumbai on how consistently destructive they've been at the end of their innings this IPL",7
Hardick just thundercunted RR holy shit,6
TyAgI boWls LikE BReTt leE,7
Watching Hardik in full flow is a totally unique experience and a treat because I haven’t seen any Indian batsman cunt the ball so hard and so well in the this decade.,9
"Should the depression thread be made now? I feel bad for RR, this feels like a disabled person being curb stomped.",8
Hardik scored 30.7% of MI’s runs with 17.5% of their balls,15
RR need a proper second overseas pacer to support Jofra instead of funneling millions to Ben Stokes every season.,10
Mumbai too OP. Has to be one of the strongest squads in IPL history along with Chennai 2010-11.,18
Wasn't it Rajput who was spanked in Pollard's big chase last year against kxip? Changed team but he sure saves his worst for MI lol.,7
Very few cunts the ball like Hardick does!,8
Hardick with his haircut and the way he speaks looks like a Saint lmao,10
Pandya waffling,5
MI batsman are the Nanatsu No Tai Zai. Too OP!,7
"Unbelievable hitting from Hardik. Tyagi could have tried one bouncer. He has this very open stance, standing back in his crease, very unconventional.",8
AWW IT'S HIS LUCKY BAT!!!!!,7
"That's probably a match winning cameo from Hardik

Brilliant hitting",5
[deleted],8
Chad Hardik!,7
For a minute I thought Mi missed a trick by not promoting the flamingo if all they were gonna do was tuk-tuk. He could've been the wall shielding the puny mortals on the other end from Archer. Turns out his services weren't needed. Great recovery this.,4
"MI batted well, make no mistake...but it was RR bowling that made 195 possible...otherwise MI should have been restricted to 170-175.",7
"HAHAHAH... He Says "" Remember the name "" .   


total meme.",15
"Everyone is giving credits to hardik,dont forget about rajpoot and tyagi. Show them some respect",7
Remember the name... Hardick is full on Windies,12
Good contributions from SKY and Tiwary today. Good on Pandya to finally come good this season. He’s the cleanest hitter in the Indian line up and his form is so important for the Indian team.,9
"What a boss, he’s saying they overshot what they needed. This confidence",5
Chad Gujju fuccboi fucks all of Rajasthan,11
Pandya in dressing room- Aaj mai RR bowlers ko karke aaya,8
meme team RCB will face MI next lol,4
Worst death bowling I’ve seen in a while...not a single Yorker. Full tosses and length bowling galore.,6
"Tyagi: i will bowl off side length balls no matter how much you smash me!

Dude, Mavi can do that without looking at the pitch!",6
Remember the name!,7
[deleted],14
"I haven't once seen Smith or Archer walk up to Tyagi when he has been getting hit this season. The guy is barely 20, for fucks sake. Dont put your hands on your hip like he is exasperating you!",62
Really feel bad for Tyagi. 1/18 to 1/45 in an over.,13
"Im calling it now, Mumbai will go all the way to the finals and lose, and everyone on r/Cricket will have surprised pikachu faces",4
Wondering how Rajpoot has t20 career economy rate of 7.4.,7
"Lmao telling Ian Bishop to ""remember the name""",10
"That's it with RR, you can play off Archer Safely and then just murder the other bowlers Or alternatively That's it with MI, if one of Hardik or Pollard is out there then RIP to the bowlers.",9
That Pandya innings is me playing Cricket 19 on easy mode,13
Breaking News: Shane Warner rushes to MI changing room during innings break to invite fuckboy to his next orgy,11
All the balls that Hardik hit for fours and sixes were right in the slot. It definitely does require skill to execute those shots but it felt like balls out a bowling machine on the same setting.,8
"Archer deserve team like MI. What a team man, it's like you are never out of options. Someone will always play.",17
"MI batting first template
1. Lose an opener early
2. Surya and Ishan assisting the other opener, at a moderate run rate. Around 85/1 in 10 overs
3. Lose couple of wickets, two new batsman knit a partnership, hoping to reach 170
4. CRAZY BATTING JUST DESTROY THEM AND CROSS 190 LIKE NO ONE'S BUSINESS POLLARD PANDYA",115
Brilliant from MI. Hopefully Bumrah and Boult open the bowling and choke RR,25
"Please nerf this MI side. Has Openers like QDK & Kishan, Middle order of SK, Finisher likes Pollard and Hardik, Bowler like Boult and Bumrah.",9
"Regardless of what happens in the chase, this is why MI is the best team this IPL. No one expected them to get above 160 at one stage but the power hitters they have are unmatched.",10
"Now Hardik has found form too, not like this team was any less scary before that.",22
Mumbai's too op man. Just too op. Wow. Just wow.,13
"Hardik from 8(9) to 60(21).
52(12)
Amazing!!",57
"LOL Hardik  ""REMEMBER THE NAME""",18
Tyagi has a gun yorker smh,2
Why didn't stokes bowl,10
"Holy fuck how did we reach 195, looked like we would struggle to 180. Hardik you beast!",13
How does such a skinny lanky guy generate so much power,25
"And now the inevitable collapse to defeat for under 100. Good times, good times.",11
[deleted],36
Pandya still couldn't break Poorans record. Wow.,8
"Possibly unpopular but I really dislike the idea of mega auctions

Would much rather see teams retain their players, have a proper contract system and a draft + transfer window or something",13
"MI fans like

Nothing much just a normal day at the office!

And every other team-

We are fucked :)",24
Mumbai are so successful because they bat deep and bowl deep. Hardik and Pollard are the link. Plus having good youngsters in SKY and Kishan helps a lot. The most balanced team,19
What is the score accumulated in last 5 overs?,4
Hardik took MS' jersey 10(20) incoming REEEEEE,5
Which 60 do you like the most? Rajpoot's or Hardik's?,19
"As soon as I started watching, Hardik started smacking all the bowlers hard. I felt like I could've missed the entire match but literally the last 10-15 minutes were insane entertainment",12
MI is definitely finishing top of the table... Don't think RR is getting anywhere close to this total esp. with their wonky batting lineup.,13
Remember the name haha,6
Can't believe I'm saying this..but next auction Archer might ask for a transfer to MI/DC.,15
And to think people were slamming pant and we might lose his smashing six hitting as a result. Imagine pant and pandya for India,10
RR are exactly where they deserve to be.,6
Boy Samad can you be half as good as Hardick,4
"Mumbai will have to be pushed to Eliminator if any other team wants to have a chance at the trophy

No way they're losing 2 out of 3",18
"CSK at least blew hot and cold picking up victories in intervals.

RR just haven't clicked as a unit since since their first two wins.

This is literally the last chance for that immense batting unit on paper to come good.",6
Now who does MI retain and use RTM next auction?,10
"RR had us in the 1st half of 2nd half, not gonna lie",9
"Indian media (the same one who translated Sunny G's commentary on Virat) - 


Hardik Pandya ko apna danda bahot pasand hai...wo khule maidan par use sehla aur lehra rahe the....",13
Why is everyone shaving their heads?,4
"I've always maintained. MI > DC. The balance is impeccable.

They could get 195 without Pollard, Rohit (who admittedly hasnt done much this IPL)",30
74 in last 4... Archer gave only 3 runs in his,13
"Mumbai got to a par score by the conclusion of the 18th over. We’re not
chasing anything above 150.

The side needs a rehaul in terms of attitude and balance . Smith was never a good captain for Australia and he’s never inspired our players or Rajastan’s. A quality second seamer is needed even if Smith or Stokes needs to be dropped. The amount that Archer has carried RR is ridiculous.

As good as Tewatia has been for us his two dropped catches of Pandya have cost us the game.",15
[I feel like this image nicely sums up Jofra vs the support he gets from other RR bowlers](https://imgur.com/UfEd2wS),17
"People say Mumbai have an unfairly strong side but in today’s playing XI, we have Krunal Pandya, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, Saurabh Tiwari and Rahul Chahar. That’s almost half the team with no or little international experience. But they’re also playing like proper international players so the team looks op",19
"Top 6 regular batsmen have hit 60+ scores some match or the other.

3 bowlers in top 10 wickettakers, could have had Pattinson as well if not for him missing matches. 

And, Krunal Pandya has done few things...

MI OP!!!",21
I want to see a world where QDK and Kishan score quick in the Powerplay then Surya and Rohit keep the run rate up till the 16th over and then Pollard Pandya finish it. 260 Possible?,38
LOOK AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD LMAOOO,5
What RR need to do is drop Stokes and play another overseas fast bowler.,10
"If Samson can take them home today, he'd live up to the talk he made at the start of the IPL.",4
Smith is the worst captain this ipl. How did he captain a team like australia,9
"The last bit of this innings was just as good as CSK winning today

/Bless",5
"MI is too OP, plizz nerf",10
"Rohit has been excellent this season, however Mumbai look even better without him in the team.",16
MI's team should be used as a template for building a T20 XI,9
Maxwell prays to the picture of Pandya in his room before coming out to bat.,9
Waiting for trolls who blamed Dhoni for depreciating opposition teams Batsman after exchange of shirts.,7
Guys if auction happens whom do we let go off this brilliant  team 😢,4
Fuccboi looking like Aang from Avatar lmao. That explains the big dick energy!!,4
"Just put the match on. 

Did I hear that right? Hardik was 8 from 9 and then 50 off 20?? 😐",5
Maybe hyperbole but Warne joins this team and then their killer instinct goes for a toss,2
Hope buttler opens for rr.. need a juicy contest...  Swann at dugout so bummed that tewatia dropped that catch,5
I was expecting MI to score around 160 - 170. But 195 is beyond imagination the way they started. And my heart goes to Tyagi. He should have tried bowling bouncers.,11
I’m just a dumb mumbaikar but I genuinely feel bad for those fans actually from Rajasthan.. y’all deserve better,5
"Wasn't there some people mocking us for being on track for 200 but collapsing in the middle.. 

How's 195 looking?",10
I don't think we can chase this but would like Uthappa to swing from bowl one to capitalise the powerplay. A 30(14) kinda score should give a good start. He anyway finds it difficult to accelerate once the field restrictions are taken away.,3
This will all stand to Tyagi in the future.,2
[deleted],6
"Mumbai are going to win this year, aren't they?",2
Who was the English commentator today? Seemed new,1
[deleted],4
40 all out will sum up RR's season. And only MI can do this.,5
Jofra should demand a trade next season,5
"Mumbai don’t have an unfairly strong side, other teams are just that shit!

Like if you think those 18 and 20 overs don’t deserve smashing, then i can’t help you.",2
Mumbai IPL 2020 reminds me of Spain in Euro 2012,5
Hardik- The last dickbender,1
Did hardik say remember the name at the end of his interview?,7
Buttler MUST open,2
Pandya is a magician. He produces this when his team is on top and totally disappears when there is a hint of pressure.,-3
"Imagine ur captain is not even playing, and people are asking for nerf",10
"A blistering Samson-Butler partnership could make this chase so spicy, but to be realistic: Samson 6(2) and Butler 60(47) being left stranded",3
"MI hitting 17 runs in a Jofra over, should seal it that this is the best team this year.",5
Buttler should flaunt his big dick tonight,10
Most of the players are scamming RR.,7
"RR did a pretty good job till the 16th over, the bowlers were honestly let down by the fielding today",4
Only way I ll be happier is if samson and buttler chase it down,5
I’m bored. Porn suggestions for the innings break anyone?,7
"Man Hardik, Polly and Bumrah are key to success for MI. They are the real backbone of this team in my opinion.",18
"RR needs 195. 2014 reversal on the plate?
And tewatia for the first ball six?",18
I don't remember the last game when MI had their no.8s and 9s out there batting.,12
"MI too OP.

Scary shit. No one is looking even remotely close to them.",14
Buttler and Stokes have to find their form today. Expect a Headingley Stokes today 🙏,5
Pandya alag hi gaanja maar ke aaya tha.,10
Only Samson can pull this off,6
Man how good was Ian bishop's commentary during the pandya carnage... Literal ear orgasms... Fucking gold,8
"Final is in Dubai, if DC make it there they just might win it",9
Rajasthan needs a centurion to win this,35
It must be really boring being an MI fan,22
"In an alternate universe Mumbai also have ABD & Pooran, and they are scoring 250+ every game",24
Mumbai should be banned for being too good.,20
"Not Samson or Buttler, Robin Uthhapa is the man tk get for MI. Smith and Stokes have been useless and Tewatia is just a fraud, by the time Archer is in it'll be too late for RR.",2
"Our Indian pacer options for next auction ? Tyagi is bad on some days but he is not Rajpoot and Unadkat bad....we need to find one more atleast average bowler.

I think if RR management puts work on Tyagi, he can be good, he lacks experience...",8
Pandya also has two big what if innings - one against Pakistan in 2017 CT finals and 91(34) innings against KKR.,8
"IPL: Play Dream 11 

President of BCCI, Sourav Ganguly: Play My 11 Circle

r/Madlads",11
If RR open with Stokes I swear to God...,9
Aaj Hardik Kar ke Aya!,4
RR will have to chase this down in 7.3 overs if they want to go to 5th on the points table.,10
"Imagine shambles if Kohli was injured for one match and had to sit out. In Mumbai, Sharma can sit out and it doesn’t affect shit",15
Can ya all please troll Smith....and Stokes....and Samson,10
"while most teams are calculating playoffs berth , mi are just practicing for the finals",12
"For people who want to know the secret of MI success, look at the strike rate column of their batting line-up.(Specially no. 4,5 and 6)

That is how you win tournaments.",11
Secret behind Pandya's sudden good form : गंजा and गांजा,7
Fault is of that owner. Why would you spend 8crores on unadcunt,11
Who was the English commentator today? Seemed new,-1
Why is the final on a Tuesday? What happened to sunday smh,1
"Controversial opinion - Bumrah, Hardik and Pollard are much more valuable for MI than Rohit. Hardil is not even bowling. These 3 have already impacted and changed course in so many matches so far.",5
Goo job Tewatia,2
next MI match against rcb. ah shit,10
Sunny G should not be allowed to commentate MI's matches,11
Most inexpensive team to win the IPL? Anyone knows?,3
Can Rohit make a comeback into this team?,14
To bowl a 3 run over in the middle of two 27 run overs is quite impressive. Jofra deserves better,15
Now normie CSK fans on facebook will say Hardik played well coz he received Dhoni's jersey in the previous match.,20
And this is how RCB you post a competitive total.,6
"Time for CSK to bring in Siraj, Rajpoot, Unadkat. You either win the IPL or become the new meme team.",8
That was just a different level of shit bowling,6
HaRdIk WiLl PlAy A tEsT kNoCk BeCaUsE dHoNi GaVe HiM jErSeY,20
I thought Unadkat wasn't that bad even. Even if he was expensive he and RR  beat MI twice with slower balls last IPL.  Why wasn't he playing?,7
Kung fu Pandya ruined Tyagi's excellent stats,10
We're going to get tonked so hard next match against MI.,3
"Consistently, bowlers will win you these types of tournaments: without high quality death-bowling, you'll clutch defeat from the jaws of victory too often - the modern day batsman is too destructive",7
Please send Buttler to open the innings. That’s the only way RR are winning this.,3
[deleted],6
Still going with stokes. RR never learns,4
Are RR the worst fielding side this IPL? Almost all sides have put some effort at one point or other except them,3
Tewatia is great but he kind of shambles if put up against a great bowler. We all saw him against DD,0
Can't believe that Rohit is the imposter in this MI line up. They function well without him!,5
https://twitter.com/MalhotraSaurabh/status/1320392417766506496?s=19,3
RR's only chance of winning is Butler. He always plays good against MI.,7
Kudos to MI for grooming top class talents like Pandya and Bumrah for India. This was the vision of ipl at the time of its inception.,9
"Mumbai are a very good side but it's not like they're stacked with 11 world class international players. 

Half their side has limited international experience, if any. They're well put together and each player understands his role.

Tbf they've created and nurtured a lot of their players as well.",10
"Unadkat to Tyagi, *what are you trying to prove by not having any no balls in the over?*",3
YES Buttler is not opening,1
Ben Stokes again? Interesting,2
Can Tyagi not speak English?Why didn’t Archer or Smith or Stokes go and give him advice and slowed the game. Length every ball against Hardik was just asking for those sixes,6
Wrong opening partnership AGAIN,1
Isn't Rajpoot the guy who winked at Pollard in the last IPL? Then got hammered left and right.,9
Stokes again :(,2
You know what I'd even let smudge have an over instead of bringing Rajpoot back after the first 2,1
World's best all-rounder gets zero overs. Is he scared to bowl or is Smith too stupid to use him properly.,4
"How will Twat redeem himself today? 




Century? 



Last ball winning 6?",6
"Reminder that Pandya was 8 (9) once

So he scored 52 (12) after that",4
Warne wanted Butler to open. It's sure thing Smith is just having ego problems.,3
I'm sold on Uthappa opening. He shows way more intent that way.,5
I still don't get why Stokes is opening....I always saw him in the finisher role than an opener (except that 1 test match),2
Every Indian cricket fan should be thankful to MI for giving us Bumrah and Pandya.,13
Stokes opening again? Brain dead stuff,3
Does Smith just absolutely hate Buttler for some reason?,8
Okay Stokes opening Mumbai top 2 confirmed now then,2
Stokes and maxwell this season played 100 or 100+ balls without hitting a 6!!!,2
Hoping Stokes/Samson/Smith/Uthappa (someone) clicks today :(,1
Smith and the coaching staffs stubbornness with the stokes opening experiment is so stupid,6
"Off cricket season, Dhawan lives in Australia. Stokes lives in NZ. Any others?",6
"We can beat Mumbai but they will play our captain who won’t bowl certain bowlers to certain batsman and win easy.

How the fuck do you apply for a different captain?",1
Dis gon be ugly :(,6
"Ben Stokes is opening again, now we know that RR doesn't even want to chase this",6
Ugh this is so braindead,3
ppl suggesting mi are fine without him is a reminder of how rohit's captaincy is so underrated as he's not showy,5
I've said it so many times. Rajdoot is a waste of a spot in the XI. He's been mediocre his entire IPL career except that one time he fluked into a 5 wicket haul.,4
Wait till RR place Buttler and Robbie open on a dead rubber and score a 150+ opening partnership,2
Get ready for 13(11) Samson.,2
Utopia with SR of 200,4
Lmao at Tiwary running for the ball.,3
We are not going to make to the playoffs but we at least deserve a win against the top team of IPL,2
RR management lower IQ than room temperature,5
Stokes again. Brain dead RR,3
MI fielders are high af on Pandu's innings,4
Chahar khada BC,2
Chahar misfields a lot.,3
They have a world class T20 opener in  Buttler but refuse to use him???,4
Most of you don't even know what OP means.,3
If is possible for mumbai to buy everyone back next auction??,8
Aye Luck on Uthappa's side today. Keep slashing my man!,3
Chahar is an absolute shit fielder,3
"Yes just like that. Keep misfielding and overthrowing. RR keep taking doubles

Eaazzy peeaazzy win",2
Stokes is a finisher ffs,6
"Unless Uthappa does a 2014 Uthappa, RR ain't winning shit.",6
"Just imagine Archer in MI and plays in place of Pattinson....

Gosh, its even so hard to imagine the level of this team....",11
[deleted],12
"To the guy with second highest upvotes on this post

Waqt ho chala hai CEAT tyres strategic timeout ka",5
"Have the management or Smith given any valid reason for opening with Stokes other than ""its justa prank brah""?",9
Need a Lord Tewatia Thunderstorm,2
Holy shit.. just checking in.,3
Buttler was their only hope and they've sent Stokes,5

Chahar shit fielder in his first seasons? Proper MI player.,8
"Fellas, why is Patto benched? Didn't do well?",1
Again. Stokes. You fuckinh cunt . McDonald,3
"“Boys from Bollywood” isn’t such a flattering title anymore. 

Anyone have some maal?",5
There is a reason England opens with Buttler and uses Stokes at 5/6,5
"england open with buttler even though they have roy, bairstow, banton competing for the spot. but yes it makes perfect sense to open with stokes",4
Do they have no other batsmen? Why are they still going with Uthappa?,2
Saurabh Tiwary running towards the ball was a pity sight...,5
Why Ben is opening? Bad management!,7
"It’s going to be real tough when the mega auction happens. Whichever 3 we retain out of Rohit Boult Bumrah Hardik Pollard, other teams will bid for the other 2 like crazy. Will be hard to RTM the rest 2 at crazy prices",5

All the best RR fans. You guys need it",7

7 sixes wow...Sakth Launda in form is better than sex,8
Why is Stokes opening??,2
"If Stokes hits a six today, give me ""Ben Stokes' bitch"" flair",15

Still they would be unbeatable.",9
"Other teams are playing for the top spot, RR out here making sure they keep their bottom spot",5
"Best part of the match: almost forgotten Tiwari smashing Jofra for 17 runs

I mean Hardik smashing Rajpoot and Tyagi doesn't excite that much",8
Open with Lord Tewatia and thank me later RR,3
You have to open with Buttler in a situation like this ffs,6
Not playing Buttler against MI is criminal considering his record against us. Surely should have opened with him,12
Archer with the highest SR of the team.,7
"Dammit...sacrificed watching MI shithouse 60 off 12 just to see RCB trudge 60 in 8 (...overs)

Also lol do they pick these youngsters straight from domestic with such minimal bowling wisdom to IPL facing world class batsmen. Pace doesn't mean shit if you're gonna spray it like a paintball gun, in the slot, at that. Didn't work for Cumdog either",8
"Man, it's so painful seeing my brother supporting RR. I was supporter of RR for being home team and finally gave up on it for last 3 years but my younger brother is still supporting it. 
The problem with RR is that they have no intent. I didn't see somebody go to Tyagi and giving him some tips in final over.

This team should be banished.",11
"So you send in the player who can hit the ball any time and hold back the guy who can either hit it or miss it but can be helped by powerplay? Yeah, RR losing this",9
What does Mumbai do different to have all the players in form plus have batsmen that can hit sixes anytime they want. The only explanation could be motabai supplying steroids.,10
This looks like the strongest MI Team. It will be a surprise if they dont win the cup this year.,15
"2 most evil things in 2020

* Corona Virus
* The barber or whoever told Chahar to try that hair style",13
Lee was a superstar wasnt he,8
Crazy to think MI had Pollard Buttler Pandya in the same team at one point.,10
I miss 2014 Butter Podi Onion Uthappa. Please stand up,8
McDonald is scamming rr. Sack him,6
Classic Robin,1
Survive the first 6 and then the match is very easy against Mumbai with Bumrah at the death being the only threat.,1
This is going to be depressing to watch,3
Yesss the cards made it to the dugout!!!,9
3 dots and a single at the end classic village stuff this from Robin,4
OH MY GOD THE CRICKET ATTAX CARDS MADE IT TO DUGOUT,6
Current MI team so similar to the Aussie team in the early 2000s. 11 match winners one after the other and showing up just when the team needs them,2
So Robbie is Robin again now?,2
"Man Brett really ended Chand's career, didn't he?",5
"RR fans begging Smith not to send Stokes to open

[Smith rn](https://i.redd.it/r488a47ti2f51.jpg)",6
"Anyways, Happy Vijaya Dashmi you all",5
stupid captaincy!! this is the type of chase that you need to start htting from the first over. Buttler should have been opening. Stokes and Uthappa will eat balls,3
[deleted],2
I want stokes to prove us wrong. But won't happen probably.,4
"Even though NCN is a more renowned T20 bowler, I think Pattinson is a better fit for MI’s bowling unit.",3
"Apart from Hardik there are only 2 Indian players who could do what he did, Rohit and KL. Hitting par Supreme.",8
Why does Uthappa mostly *check* his shots?,4
"If Stokes is struggling at the top where he has time to get himself in and take advantage of the powerplay, why do people think he'll do better in the middle order?",4
"whoever is incharge of RR batting order needs an MRI, he/she must have brain damage",8
"Damn, MI is Buttler's punching bag",12
Will Ben Stokes finally hit a six after more than 100 deliveries in IPl 2020. Stay tuned to find out.,11
Get Bumrah in pls,5
RR has done jack shit after their first season win. They just escape the memes like DC and RCB because of their first season win.,13
Getting Stokes in the opening proves its all a Simulation.,11
">Look at the dance 
 
lmao, Harsha handled that nicely",6
That brett lee ball ended chand's career.,8
Did hardick bend a knee for BLM?,8
"What a cover drive. C'mon, Robin!",5
"RR need a prime Uthappa to chase this

Edit: LOL he gone",27
Ffs give Bumrah the new ball,9
"Scenes if utappa hits all 196 runs

Edit: I am sorry utappa",29
Pattinson!!!! Oh yeah,6
Thank fuckkk,7
Why are they calling him robin. Has he changed his name again?,8
Robin attapattu departs 🤣,5
Smith it is,5
First one of three Mandatory RR wickets in Powerplay,8
That's curtains for Coulter Nile,4
"Clever from Robbie, Stokes can't continue his disappointing run as opener if he never gets to face a ball",10
how is mumbai allowed to have the best finishers and death bowlers,11
Why Smith instead or Buttler,5
Ladies and gents.. that's been Robin Uthappa,2
Smith 2(5) coming up,2
LMAO very nice,1
"Very strange that Stokes continues to open for RR over Buttler ...

That is a super retarded decision.",11
Welcome back Pattinson!,3
Pattinson's hair evolved like a Pokémon,6
Uthappa out!!! Will pollard increase his winning streak to 16 as captain?,2
For a few minutes I thought we are going to see redemption from Uthappa. That would be too much even for this IPL.,5
RR gonna tuk tuk now.,7
Why would you not send in Buttler now?,6
"Should have just slashed with power. Uthappa is doing this every match. Couple of dots, couple of bad deliveries for boundaries followed by a chip to give away his wocket",2
Should have sent samson for PP. Smith will get out to boomrah trying to play his stupid shots.,5
"Uthappa pulling an Uthapam 

Rajasthan fans: FML! Time to drown in a spoon full of water.",6
Robin cannot become a batman today.,9
Told you guys that Uthappa has already finished his quota of 1-2 good innings per season.,8
I know he has been inconsistent but where the fuck is Samson?,7
Every time I’ve watched Uthappa the last 3 weeks I’ve just been in a permanent state of “disappointed but not surprised”,5
"**1.5** Pattinson to Uthappa, OUT, **taken at mid-on.** Locked on the front foot again. This is a length ball outside off. He wants to shovel that wide of mid-on. But it's off the high part of the bat and floats gently to Pollard's left **13-1**

RV Uthappa c Pollard b Pattinson 13 (11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 118.18",3
I am scared of Jos the most. He loves cunting us ever since we didn't retain him after our title winning season.,23
That went from Prime Robin Uthappa to Current Robin Uthappa very quickly.,9
Is the sound fucked up for anyone else,8
Damnit they only showed Brett Lee. I wanted to see Scott styris's card lol,5
RR deserve this for underusing Lord Tewatia,7
Love Smith in tests but he's not that good in T20 imo,10
Damn James Pattinson looks a lot like William Zabka (Johnny Lawrence from Cobra Kai),7
Baskin Robbins is missing out on not sponsoring Rajasthan royals. They are already subconsciously making me crave for their ice-creams with their color scheme.,10
Why Smith? He ain't gonna do shit,8
Is the commentary sound fucked for anyone else or just me?,8
Pattinson looks like Jamie Vardy without malnutrition,10
"Is it just me or have the comms gone all robot, I kinda like it ngl",8
Smith is the Chappell to RR's Team India.,4
Pattinson in and MI is again looking like an unbeatable team,6
I just realized RR is us with a weaker bowling,9
"Whoever is in charge of coming up with RR batting order, you maybe fit to become a President with such bad decisions",7
Why would you hold your opener and play finisher at the top? Just RR doing RR things.  They deserve to be at the bottom. Twetia deserves a better team.,7
RR deserve to lose. It’s criminal to not let Buttler bat as an opener,8
"And kids, that's how mediocrity met your Aunt Robin",8
"Option A- SR 140, Most Explosive in the team, Scooped a 156   Option B- SR~100, Looks out of nick",7
Why is Corpse Husband commentating?,6
Stokes not played a single ball after 2 overs,4
So glad to have Pattinson back. NCN got his chances but never found his form with the ball.,5
Rajpoot 60 (24) > Fuccboi 60* (21),12
RR management smoking hard. They just can't get their batting order right,3
Thank you whoever plugged in the audio properly.,7
Sound might be messed up just for Sky people,6
"The only rationale behind opening with Stokes I can think of is that it'll make him come back to form. They think that he'll not be useful in the middle order with this form. He can utilize the powerplay with a handy innings

Which is dumb cuz you should always try to make the most of your strength (by opening Buttler), not trying to alleviate a weakness",6
Very good commentary cameo from Johnny 5,2
MI could play with blindfolds and still win this match,5
Stokes hit a six before the end of this IPL please 🙏,5
"Hey rr fans, wanna have general convo in comments? Dard kam hoga",3
Senior RR player being so shit this year that I trust Parag and Tewatia more.,9
"RR deserve their downfall. They keep messing their batting lineup instead of playing them at their best positions....Why is Stokes opening when he is much better down the order?

Why is Uthappa playing and opening!?

Why not have Buttler open?

*Edit* : Whoops! Maybe Stokes one could work out...",6
Lmao Stokes faced his first ball in the 3rd over.,14
"Boult Smith Stokes QDK

4 players from the 4 SENA countries in a line on the pitch rn, 2 batsmen, the bowler and the keeper",9
"Ok guys, I agree Smudges has been a terrible captain with his batting order and bowling changes but you can't help with such braindead death bowling!!!",6
Boult vs Stokes. Nostalgic,11
Another IPL win for MI this season,5
Robbie robin' us again - RR management,5
Stokesy in the mood,5
Are we gonna see a Stokes special?,5
Stand and deliver,2
"RR were right on the chase till 0.2 overs

RRR : 9.76

CRR: 12

then it all unravelled.",2
Wonder what goes on with decisions like not opening with buttler. Who's the coach for RR? Is it warne?,3
Boult has PTSD,18
Damn Stokes,8
It's time Stokes cunted the kiwis after so long time... sed lyf,12
I'm cautiously optimistic.,10
"Buttler should have come in, purely for the intimidation and Vietnam flashbacks for Boult from that superover",17
[deleted],12
"Stokes looking good, which means he's getting out soon",13
Intent bhi hai spark bhi. We might be looking forward to a cracking match,11
Can he get a Six?,5
Stokes already looking miles better than the last game. Looks back to his best really with those types of shots.,8
Ay this is brisk me likey. And good that Samson ain't out there yet,10
Boults hair game is not on point today,4
"Imagine sending in your best batsman, and one of the great LO players, in at a position they can win the match from. Imagine",9
Stokes has arrived?,15
Boult PTSD.,15
LORD BEN STOKES 🙏,11
Stokes: Yeah strike rate talk nah,15
"Lord Tewatia, please redeem yourself with the bat just one last time.",12
"Hardik needs a strong team like MI to be good.



When he come to bat teams have already exhausted Thier best bowlers trying to get MI top order out.




When he bowls batsman have to go for his length balls because of dot pressure created by Bumra/Boult




Change my mind",4
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
Stokes proving r/cricket wrong,4
"Rr fans-stokes why don't you hit sixes

Stokes-ah, because fours are just fine",8
Just saw the ball by ball highlights of Hardik Pandya's batting. Worst buffet help yourself bowling you could ever see,3
Boult wtf,0
Man Stokes playing proper cricketing  Test match strokes to prepare for the Ashes. Who said English cricketers don't care about Test r4icket anymore,3
stokes tryna make this harder for me.. I know the collapse is coming can you hurry up,6
How does an international sportsperson playing for the best cricket franchise in the world rock such a terrible haircut?,3
When was the last time Stokes had a match winning performance?,6
BEN STONKS 📈,6
Stokes starts hitting.                                                                               Samson- 6(2) sankat mein hai,2
"Oh Ben, don't tease me like this. I know you're getting out next over",12
Stokes vs Boult....hmm when was the last time I saw that 🤔,17
Unrelated: Why doesn't BCCI allow Indian players to participate in overseas leagues?,3
"16(6)

Kohli : Ben Stokes",10
"Come on Ben keep going. Don’t leave it to Smithy. 😂

Fuck yes BEN!",6
RR spent all the money on overseas glamour boys and collected  leftover Indian trash on their way out of the auction.,6
16 from 6. Hmmm serious WC vibes,5
"BENJAMIN ANDREW STOKES

Remember the name. Just do it",8
MI have the perfect T20 XI. Amazing how they've assembled this squad together.,7
Can't blame Boult. It reminds him of the final over of the world cup. Poor guy '(,10
"It's been a year and I still feel the NZ players are not over that final. Seeing Stokes, England and Super Overs really scares the shit out them I feel. 

Boult has been so good this year, especially in the powerplays, but Stokes!",17
Not just because I am RCB fan but I genuinely feel that MI vs RCB will really a interesting match!,6
"Someone told Ben to ""remember the name"" before he came out to bat",15
oh fuck off we cannot get this lucky,5
"DC and RCB have lost their games this weekend, only fair MI do the same.",12
I’m getting india versus Australia Test cricket PTSD already,10
Pollard gunning for that fairplay award,7
Something nice about fielders signalling that it's a boundary,12
Would love to have Smith's invincible mode arrive too,10
Of course it took Boult to bring Stokes back to form,20
Uh oh MI is in trouble. This is WC 2019/IPL RPS vs RCB Stokes showing up today,10
[deleted],1
This is why MI are leading in Fairplay,34
Love how Pollard signals its a 4.,16
Stokes isnt back. He's just teasing us,12
[deleted],2
would be great if these overseas guys could live up to their hype today but. nahhh,5
Mumbai the Fair Play champs,6
Bumrah 100 IPL wickets watch.,3
The only way for MI to stop Lord Stokes is to bring up QDK to the stumps,6
"fellas, is it time to panic yet?",10
SMith and Stokes will chase 195b in classical down the ground strokes today. Mark my words.,11
"Love it when fielders signal boundaries

Saves time and 15 replays where everyone apart from the third umpire can tell its a boundary",23
"Ben Stokes, sees New Zealand bowler

*Eyes shine in red colour *",18
"I’ve seen some DC fans claim that DC is better than MI and is the actual best team of the IPL. They claim that their bowling is better and that there’s more talent in their batting line up with Dhawan, Shaw, Iyer, Pant , Stoinis and Hetmyer. What are the counter arguements to this?",7
"stokes is much better vs pace than spin, which is probably the thinking for him opening vs buttler (who is more versatile). pollard should have mixed it up.",5
Wait wtf. Sandeep Sharma took 100 wickets in 87 matches. His stats are better than bumrah lmao,11
What happened to Rohit? Is he injured?,3
All four of Mumbai's overseas are from different countries,3
"Smith was better off opening. Honestly, he has been weird this IPL",5
"Man, Boult is so damn hot and cold lmao. 

Really need more consistent bowling for him when we get to the playoffs.....",5
Rahul Chahar is a real life GTA character.,10
haha fuck me.,7
hit bumrah for a six,6
Okay we're gonna have a decent chase. But wait...,3
s i x from stokes at last!!!!,-2
Don't give me hope,5
Bumrah isn't able to turn the ball like he used to IMO,2
"Poor Pollard, all that fairplay and MI will still not end up with the fairplay award.

Number of Dhoni's in team = 0
Likelihood of earning the award = 0%",9
"Gotta say, poor bowling from Boult. It was clear that the ball stopped swinging after a couple of overs but he still went searching for it on most deliveries.",6
Maybe we got Uthappa out too early?,13
"Bumrah will go for 20 runs, them come back with a 3 wicket maiden or some crazy shit",5
"These guys are trying to give me hope. But no,not this time.",8
Wtf rr having a good pp,10
Pack it up bois. RR winning this,3
I refuse to get even slightly optimistic,3
Smith ??? Is this an imposter??,3
Most of you don't even know what OP means.,11
Even Smudge is hitting sixes in this season but Stokes and Maxwell can't,7
This is poor bowling from Bumrah,3
"Love Smith batting tbh. Such unorthodox player, like a big fuck you to other batsmen lolol.",7
"They call him Steve

He's known for his leave

Not today.",7
Panic time boys.,4
"Honestly the fact that RR have underachieved despite having Smith, Buttler, Stokes, Archer will always baffle me.",21
This is class batting. Hope we see it more,4
Finch and stokes both broke their six draught tiday,10
This is still very doable for RR.,2
"Fun stat:

*IPL record*

Bumrah: 88 matches, 99 wickets, ER 7.56

Sandeep Sharma: 87 matches, 101 wickets, ER 7.79",87
Can these two 12.5Cr + 12.5Cr batsmen get RR close to 195?,13

I'm so done with this fake crowd noise,0
Stonks,1
This is Sharjah Smith playing,4
For a second  I thought it was Stokes who hit the six and got worried,6
Strike rate and RCB don't go together,2
"Smith should've been told to open but been told to play normal cricket shots instead of slogging, and this season could've been very different.",4
Ben “remember the name” stokes,6
where are the MI flairs. guys come back please celebrate. stokes and smudge are just trolling us fans,7
"Lmao calm down Pattinson, you would've had to be Mr. Tickle to catch that, don't throw a hissy fit",8
"Looks like Stokes isn't trying to overhit the ball today, he's holding his shape more so far",1
"Don't get out slogging pls, Smudge",6
What did Pattinson say to him?,3
"Wanna hear a joke?

_MI fans panicking_

Fyi Me MI fan too",5
Lol Pattinson vs smudge,2
"lol what did Pattinson say to Smith? can anyone lip read edit - Scotty said that Pattinson said ""that's not your game mate""",5
Lol RR will still lose,13
"Different formats and different situation yet can't help but feel there is different subtext to the Bumrah-Smith match-up here with the Test series looming. Smith's shots were telling. It's going to be an interesting watch.

Edit: Well, nvm. Lol.",1
"I just checked the score, last time was when MI were after 15 overs. What happened?",4
There’s the match,2
Pattinson is bae,8
Lol at Pattinson chirpin at Smitty aaaaand taken!,6
RR should seriously not invest in unadcut next season and should try for basil or someone like that.,9

Nice inswinger there!,9
"Dread it, run from it, MI's pace attack still arrives!",11
"Why isn’t he this easy to get out in tests?

E: I know the reason it was rhetorical.",13

I love Pattinson but in two months he's going to rip through the Indian batting lineup.,13
Smith is garbage in ipl,7
Classic Australia sledging,6

fuck these guys are OP with their sledging too?!?,3
Which country is Pattinson from?,5
Send Lord Tewatia in please🙏,2
Smith gets Played on a LOT. Probably because of the way he moves his bat around.,4
Virender Smith. Steve Sehwag. Stevewag. Vireven.,5
Drop Smith for Miller. Make Buttler captain. Drop Stokes down the order. Don't know how many times I have to say it.,7
JP Duminy knows he's a proper commentator now.,6
Ffs Smith. It's probably just his technique but he always seems to get out in such ugly ways,5

Next Up is a nice 6(2),8

One more wicked and RR is back to normal duties,5
"When it doesn’t work, Smith looks like a clueless batsman lol.",2
Send Archer you cowards,5
It’s clear that Devereux doesn’t care enough about this team to perform his best every match. Warner has that emotional connection. Make someone else the captain.,4
Why is Smith paid soo much? Lol release him. 6 crore quality,2
There was a run there,1

I want an RR shirt but they’re not shipping to UK are they?,4
Samson. For once. Don't do something dumb,8
Pattinson dropping truth bombs with great deliveries.,3

Bye guys,4
"Pattison > NCN 

Because of the pace",10
"When CSK and RR were banned , for whom did Sanju play?",1
Australian players have been so disappointing this ipl.,4
Sanju bhai 50 needed,2
"No sledging this IPL..fuck the fair play award
Make things a bit spicier..used to be very funny when young Indian fast bowlers( after 1 good performance) have a go at experienced batsmen and missing people like Gambhir,...Even Pollard is silent",9
What an excellent buy Pattinson has been this season for MI. Their team management makes everyone really comfortable and good about themselves that everyone gives their best performance.,7
Sanju Samson needs to play like he does. I mean thats their only chance anyway lol.,6
"That Pattinson's ball seamed a lot to take out Smith.

I have faced a similar ball and got out in similar fashion years ago and I still remember it",3
RR are better foreshadowers than some Mangaka.,5
Lmao atleast prove your worth for once sanju,5
Well left,1
What did Hardik do? Saw a few comments saying he said remember the name or something like that. Can someone please fill me in?,2
"2 years of intently watching Smith and he's still a mystery to me. 

I have never see a batsmen like him have so much success yet fail at such basic line and length stuff. 

I want SKY to get some run in ODIs.",11

"Which scenario has better odds, RR getting into top 4 or Samson being consistent?",6
Looking forward to Krunal's dots followed by his fist bumps,5
It wasn't a swing. It was a seam.,10
Cred ad is really funny.,9
"Why are left handers so confident about the reverse sweep, and still miss it everytime",4
Pattinson has been more impactful this season. Unlike what others say about Boult-Bumrah. Not saying B and B are bad. Just saying that Pattinson isn’t getting the same attention.,5
I see many people claiming Buttler to be the best t20 opener rn. Is there any stats to back up that he's better than QDK or even Kl for that matter?,5
unrelated question :- what team would be suitable for the upcoming aus tour? they have smith and warner now so how are we going to approach that? dont forget  Labuschagne being in the form of his life,5

How many wickets for Bumrah so far?,4
Ben stokes’s reverse sweeps are always FIRE,7
Stokes : I am the Buttler now.,14
God every reverse sweep shot reminds me of MVP Jimmy🙏,6
"They got runs off Bumrah and Boult, Pattinson picks up 2 wickets. There is always someone who turns up big for MI.",5
The bowling set up of MI helps to hide Krunal when the opponent team is under pressure. This wont work in international matches.,7
"I wish they’d just rotate Sanga, Nicholas, Pommie and Bish on commentary",7
decision of Holding Buttler back now looks good.,9
Not a 6 lol,8
Wow! 4 tries for a boundary?,6
Stokes almost got a six ALMOST,8
"Phew, Not A Six",7
I thought that was a six for sure wtf,8
I almost.... ALMOST thought that he hit a six,8
um stokes! lottery numbers please,5

KPandya can't even say bc mc to his brother,7
Stokes looking good today...still not hit a six tho,8
"Smith has really flown under the radar this season , he's been the worst overseas Captain , contributed next to nothing with the bat",12
Still no six,7
"lol Krunal would have thrown tantrums if that was not Hardik, that was a decent effort though",13
SKOKES needs to lessen his elevation.,7
"Smith: does something crazy

Pattinson: that's not your game smudge

Samson: does something sensible

Pandya: abey kya kar raha hai Sanj",14
Stokes may not have hit a six but he's hit quite a lot of fours,11
How big is the field?,4
That *Boom* music in the bike ad is pretty good tho....,6
Good effort,3
"When it doesn't work, he looks really confused.


When it works, the whole world looks really confused. 

Just Smith things..",13
That seemed like Hardik misjudged the ball.,3
"Stokes is yet to hit a six in the IPL. So if it goes up, it’s highly likely staying in the ground!",7
everybody’s playing cricket but Pandya bros are playing dhandiya,11
Stokes has such a lovely reverse sweep. I remember him bringing it out a lot in the tests over the summer,15
"Krunal be like- Kya karu iska, isko maar bhi nahi sakta, pyaar jo karta hai itna mere se",16
Hehe! Now Kurnal cant say MC/BC!!!,28
Probably feels he should have caught it when he got that close to it. Would have been a brilliant catch.,3
Stokes going to get to 85 off 35 without hitting a six at this rate,11
That was a catch that should have been caught by Hardik! Can't wait for Tewatia to lay into Boult and Buttler to take down Bumrah and Pattinson.,4
"Samson on strike, definitely go for wicket alert",2
Shoes off if you love Ben Stokes,13
Just waiting for Samson to hit a 6....,6
warne said butler should open so this means smith have full control over the team..,2
Pollard so thiccc,5
Time for a spinner,2
"this is the weirdest thing to say but krunal Pandya looks like an angry bird, the red one. idk but it just makes sense",12
Stokes can't hit a six even if Kiwis attack NZ And only his six can end the war!!!,8
Can Pollard take a wicket here,1
Pollard with 109km ball,5
Pollard always brings himself in when he’s the captain.,7
"Huh, Ben Stokes really did not like his name being on the worst strike rate list.",7
"Stokes to Hardik- ""You just dropped the match mate""",1
Pollard bowls himself more often when he's captain,13
Pollard should have bowled in the powerplay,3
Who is the best reverse sweeper among Indian players?,1
"Krunal can say bhenchod to Hardik lol, what bhen is there to chod?",9
Lol tired of looking at Samson at Most sixes list,12
Here comes Pollard: one of most smashable bowlers who doesn’t get smashed enough.,15
I'm a huge MI fan but I just want Stokesy to hit a six before getting out,7
"Why don't RR make Buttler captain? Smith as captain makes no sense to me, his captaincy credentials were destroyed after Sandpapergate. Also, Buttler is a far superior T20 batsman and understudy of Eoin Morgan",9
Bold prediction: Stokes's six this inning will come off an overthrow that ricochets off his bat,17
"55 is a decent pp, par for a chase like this. But they just need to not lose wickets and try to acc..._looks at MI bowling_ oh. Nevermind",7
"Samson off the mark, moral victory",5
Sanju please perform.,8
[Samson's performance vs match of the season in last three years](https://i.imgur.com/bvk190a.png),6
Stokes seems to do better when the situation is do or die.,16
Ben stokes has a strike rate of 200 . Excuse me.. WHAT???,13
Pollard's right arm slow bowling is gonna get trashed today.,7
Bowling is so fun hehe ~ Pollard,23
You know I think it may be possible that Stokes wasn't very good in the first games as he hasn't played cricket for months and is dealing with terminal illness in his immediate family,13
Is pollard good bowler? I get collingwood vibes,11
"I missed last hour of the game, but wtf Bigdick Pandya! 8(9) to 60(20)


52 runs in 11 balls! 😯🤯🤓",11
Pollard covering up for some bowlers if they get smashed and may not bowl their full spell. Smart cricket.,18
Pollard's wingspan must be greater than umpire's height lmao,12
SKOKES is a Manish Pandey that can bowl in recent T20s.,5
"Only 113 clicks, really messing with Stokes timing.",5
Pollard rushing through the over. Jaddu of medium pace bowling,3
"Pollard the Captain bowling himself reminds me of a certain 
Gulbadin Naib",7
I thought Pollard was signalling a wide for himself then,6
Just happy RR didn't lose 3 wickets in PP for today :),2
15-16 sixes in 1st 2 matches for Sanju,3
In 2010 when Pollard was just coming through I thought he was a big hitter and this terrifying Archer level fast bowler.  Then he bowled his first over for MI......,8
I love these unexpected economical Pollard over,8
"Polly bowls some dollies, doesn't he?",1
Smart gameplay by MI. Get Stokes into form now so that he can mess up other teams plans in the next matches,7
"Krunal: Bhaichod catch pakad!

Hardik: (-_-;)


Hardik: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)


Krunal: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",14
Jos Buttler gotta score like Hardik if RR want to win.,6
You cannot let Pollard bowl a 5 run over.,11
Pollard 🐐🙏,12
Polly...,6
"Stokes will hit his first six of this season against Boult with 7 runs needed off the last ball to tie the game.

NVM",7
Bold Prediction: This is the match Stokes wins for Royals. He hasn't done that once in 3 seasons. It is time for him to start doing something otherwise he won't get his next million dollar gig.,9
Finally!,5
Can someone cut off Anukul Roy’s and Chahar’s man bun please,2
"IT...
 HAPPENED",5
FINALLYYYYYYYYY,5
And breathe.,2
It's happening guys,3
Ffs Why did Stokes hit a six,4
There is literally no drop of intensity from MI. They deserve to win no matter what.,3
*Dekho wo aa gya*,3
1st six of Stokes!,4
r/cricket wish is complete,8
1st six for stokes..way to go,7
Aa The Rain that we all prayed for...,1
Stokes: *my time has come*,2
OMG A STOKES SIX AT LAAAASTTTTT,3
Yeaaaa.... First for stokes,3
"The way Pollard bowls, he should be getting tonked for 20+ per over but he rarely goes for 20 runs because he bowls smart, he bowls according to batsman. His game awareness is top notch.",6
Theres the six. Woo,2
Six curse lifted,7
Come on stokes help rr pull this insane comeback off man. Will be pretty sick if that actually happens lol all the top 3 teams getting trashed over the weekend by the lower ladder ones,2
THAT'S A SIX. HE'S HIT A SIX YOU CAN SHUT UP NOW.,6
"Who's India's all time best timer of ball?

Ben has done it! HE HAS DONE IT!,3
"Stokes hit a 6, at last....",4
"Stokes hits a six, finally",5
"Guys I figured it out, stokes is just Buttler under a mask",7
Finally !!!!,3
"Yes, Maxi will take the record home now! Something to show for him",6
"Mumbai's bowling attack is very overrated isn't it? Their batting is insane and easily the best, but they really lack another good death bowler other than bumrah or a top spinner",1
HE SCORED A SIX,5
Finally. Finally!!,6
4D chess by Samson and Stokes to not hit Polly and increase his confidence so he bowls more and gets smashed,10
"Stokes hits 6

  


r/cricket : MIRACLE!! MIRACLE!!",11
hey... I didn’t know that was allowed... quick someone check the rule book,2
6 FOR STOKES KLAXON,6
oooooh!! HE gets IT!!! First one for Stokes!,7
Maxwell stranded as the only batsman to face 100+ balls without a six this season,9
Yessssssss!!!!!!,3
FINALLY A SIX,2
Finally!,2
They always say a 120'er is slower ball from Pollard or Russell but it's low key their stock ball...or so I thought until Russell rolled a 98'er the other day,2
"How many wickets for world's best T20 bowler, Jasprit Bumrah so far?",-8
Now only Maxwll left,3
Stokes is a god while playing that shot.,11
All eyes on Glenn Maxwell now.,12

Maxwell reclaims the most balls faced without a 6 title,8
"Ben, you can get out now. Because all everyone wanted for you to is hit a six.",6
Stokes 6 hYPE TRAIN,7
Tfw Pollard has a better economy rate than every bowler from RR,6
Stokes heard you all talking shit,11
Finally Stokes has a six,6
Wtf is sharmaji doing there at boundary?,4
EVERYBODY STAY CALM IT'S HAPPENING IT'S HAPPENING,10
STUPID SEXY STOKES. SORRY WOAKES,15

Stokes is finally warmed up after his sabbatical. Perfect timing  for England :),22
have my children Stokesy,12
"Lol, thought that was a ball boy. Turns out it was just Rohit",34
Mumbai's losing control..,5
Lol stokes played 1 full innings before hitting six,7
What exactly is up with Rohit Sharma?,9
If I had to pick anyone in world cricket to clutch this it's be stokes,17
Bowling leg spinner to left handed batsman was a bad idea?,7
"That 1 CricViz Analyst- I knew it all along, but nobody believed me",6

Stokes only performs well when a win is supposed to be impossible.,9
Stokes bringing the maal big time 😎,1
Hope Eden ends his goal drought just like Stokes ended his six drought. But first he has to get fit. Sigh.,4
When was the last time y'all watched a paddle sweep?,4
Waiting for sanju to somehow fuck it up even when stokes is playing perfectly,5

Flashback to Stokes' 100 masterclass.,17

r/cricket - We memed him back in the form!

Samson should  try to take single and doubles when he cant find boundaries,2

Stokes is gonna keep going and by lawd hope he does. Don't want a slowdown now if he goes,1

Looks like Ben Stokes is gonna pull a Ben Stokes.,21

Would love to see last over from boult 16 off 6 needed and butler and stokes at the crease.,14
Sanju you carrot don't fuck this up,10
"If RR don't lose wickets in clusters given intent being shown by them and batting left to come, RR should at least reach near to the score quie easily.",3

This innings from Samson 😩😩 so much better than anything that Buttler could do,5

Runs in over from Pollard: 5",6

“Opposition team selects the substitute fielder!”",5
"Just tuned in, wtf happened to stokes lol",4
MI a bit of a trouble today. Let’s see how the bowlers step up in such a situation,6
"If we lose today. I’m giving up on RR man. Can’t lose my shit every season and then still keep hopes for the next season. That’s it.

Edit: I take this back. RR rocks.",6

Damn that ceat ad robot's face is cursed,6
"Rohit: I'm injured

also Rohit: bhai ye lo ball :""v",19
MI needs a wicket. Time to bring the specialist fielder on and wait for Samson to hand him a catch.,4
RR will have to pull a tewatia and a Ben stokes to win this game.,4
That Pandya innings has woken up Stokes lmao. Can't be outperformed by a guy who was memed out of comparison to Stokes.,8
"Anukul Roy after last auction: What will be my role at MI?

In b4 krunal pulls out that Kedar jadhav action,3
Pollard with his arm strength can easily cross 150 kph with practice but he would rather be in 100% control of the ball,3
Effortless hit.,1
Oh lawd he hit a six,4
Wow... that's some classy shot.,1

What was that ?,1
"Now we got a little taste, I want more Danny Morrison from JP.",3

A bouncer now?,6

Told ya. Samson is due for a big one.,3
Table toppers slipping and stumbling as the group stages finish up...nice.,2
"On a serious note guys lol -


Stop with the fickle mindedness for a while. You won't be needing any apology threads at all. Keep the shitposting limited to the match. New day, new chance for the player to perform.",2
Okay as much as criticial I am of Samson he seriously is immensely talented has to give himself some time and can do wonders. Has to take RR over today,3
Chutia Sanjay Bangar trying too hard,1
What happened to regular Samson? Who's this??,2

"18th & 20th over were too costly for RR, otherwise this would’ve been a cakewalk for them to chase",4

Jayawardhane loved it,5
Alright maybe we were too quick to say when we said MI were too overpowered,5

Stokes in Edgbaston mode he ain't giving up this one.,8
So you fucking RR batsmen decide to turn up against MI when u had all these other teams to thrash. Wtf man,14

It is amazing batting from Samson and stokes,2
Samson and Stokes going nuclear. Too late for RR but great fun to watch.,2
Would be good to split PP in to two. 1-3 and 18-20. Perhaps it would give the batting more sense to remain in there and attack later.,5

Eat shit @all sanju haters,3
Stokes is playing in edgbaston and Samson is playing in Sharjah,4
MI need a full revamp IMO,0
Miller would make 100 in half the balls smh rr,2

"What a turnaround from lower teams now thrashing upper teams, pleasure to watch",2

Yeah bowl out bumrah,3

MI fans: Is this what it feels like support a weak team?,1
"Yeah r/cricket, talk nah",2
Lol Stokes was going to hit stumps in frustration for missing that,4
Bumrah's _almost_ got that dad bod hasn't he?,0
No intent in Mumbai's bowling,2
r/cricket on suicide watch,3
I love how animated Stokes is. It just shows how much this means to him. He just really loves cricket and I respect that.,6
"you can troll him all you want about his inconsistency, but you can't deny that Samson is pure class and power combined. when he gets going, he's just magnificent.",7
Last two batsmen i expected to do the sensible chase that was required today. Was pinning my hopes on a quick fire 30+ from Robbie and some wickets before Smudge and Jos take it home,0
Think bumrah will get a wicket this over,4
"Stokes back to hitting sixes. Sanju improving his second half avg, looking positive for RR. But is it too late (in the tournament)?",4
Samson is buttery smooth,8
"An in-form Stokes elevates every team in the world

Glad he is back to what he can do",8
Another over of Bumrah extracted!!! Play it out and you've won this. 40 odd on the last 5 with only one of those overs being Bumrah,3
[removed],15
"Forcing Pollard's hand with Bumrah, just knock him around for 7-8 runs this over",6
Who bowls the next over? Pollard?,3
"The more I watch the IPL, the more I know that a good first innings score is very unpredictable. Yesterday, 125 turned out to be plenty because the pitch turned into a minefield during the middle overs plus some horrible batting by SRH. Today it's a belter and even 200 is not a safe score.",6
"Bumrah better bowl such lovely overs in Australia too, please, thanks",2
lol pooran is everywhere in the records.,1
unless you have jadhav or you  are team named SRH you cant lose from here as chasing team,7
Maybe Bum Bum can pull off a Bum Bum,3
pollard needs to bowl an over or 2. slow the pace down.,1
Samson time travelled here to play his first 2 innings quota!,1
RR are kind of ahead of the run rate and they can afford to just play out Bumrah. Don’t do anything stupid now please.,2
"I think both KXIP and RR might have exposed a very small weakness in Mumbai's bowling: they seem to get rattled when you go after Boult and the other bowlers early on in the powerplay, and keep putting pressure on the rest. It sounds absurd and it's a tough ask, but truth be spoken everyone but Bumrah in this MI attack (especially other pacers) are people who tend to crack under pressure. If they lose, failing to defend 195 with their best bowling attack in Abu Dhabi will be alarming for Mumbai.",6
Ben stokes got this,2
"Stokes in ashes mood, won't go without winning this",7
Feels like every ball in the outfield goes straight to Anukul Roy,3
"Damn, stokes hits pretty hard and beautifully.",6
script writers really tryna shake up the table this week,11
"Samson is really a delight to watch when in form. If only he was more consistent, he would be a permanent fixture in the Indian team",5

"Yes Delhi, this is how you chase a 190+ total",6
This is absolutely class batting from Samson,5
Stokes century please,3
yooooo even samson taking bumrah for a ride,4
Imagine how easy this would be if Rajpoot didn't play,6
Missing hardik as a bowler very badly,2
This is pure bliss,3
Our bowling is quite weak without the powerplay wickets,2
Aw yea Sanju,2
Where's the Yorker my man?,2
Torn between praising RR vs wanting them to lose so csk doesn't end up last on the table,3
"I'm sorry fellas but when stokes starts like this, it really is over for you",3
"Goddamn if they had played like this since the start, first CSK and now RR.",2
Poor Danny having to call Rajasthan double Rs bc Delhi got rid of their double Ds,4
Anukul Roy is definitely an upgrade in the field over Saurabh Tiwary,2
I feel MI that plays in league stages and MI that plays in playoffs are different teams so those who are thinking MI isn't indestructible do this against them in playoffs I will agree with you!,2
Samson is basically Bottas,3
"CSK beat RCB

KKR beat DC

RR beat MI?

This table might get interesting",18
Unlikeliest duo for the most well balanced partnership while chasing for the season,7
why does hardik not bowl anymore?,3
One boundary and no dot balls per over will take RR to win easily,3
"Sanju ! So mercurial , but when he clicks so beautiful to watch !",12
This match is over,3
While I agree Smith has not been good this season but he has not been completely useless. He has had a few good innings afair,9
Hmmm... DC struggling in batting and MI struggling with bowling at the moment... Wonder how the playoffs will be.,6
Yeah we lost.,8
"Samson is hitting fours through placement and not power. If this Samson starts turning up more often, holy shit.",19
So satisfying to watch,3
Boom boom bowling Trash balls.,5
Has Hardik not bowled even a single delivery in nets too?,6
Somebody told Samson it's the first game of ipl 2021,12
No team is really untouchable. Any team can beat anyone on their day. This is why IPL is so good.,30
I want to see a stokes 100 now,4
Who’s the louder commentator on English commentary?,1
Having a big over like this off Bumrah is huge,6
Buttler can single-handedly take care of the rest now lol,4
What is MI's head to head record with RR? RR always seem to bring out their A game against MI. Today they didnt even need Buttler to do it!!,7
Is now a good time to have hope or is the collapse still inevitable,5
RR are just prime CSK in pink against us.,10
Its okay guys Bumrah rarely has a bad day.. even the best get cunted eventually,5
MI will somehow get this to a super over,6
RR with the fuckin mask off,9
"With this rr win, the outside chance csk had has come to an end.. gg guys, 2020 is truly a weird year.. won't be a surprise if rcb wins.",3

In the first half when pitches were expected to be fresh and dew was expected, teams batting first won. Now when pitches are expected to slow down, the trend has reversed (* _ *)",8
Samson denying Stokes a ton smh,4
"is Samson our future Brohit cuz he reminds me of Pre-Rohit 


I can see a thick Samson in coming years scoring double hundreds in ODIs for fun",14
Pattinson reminds me of Cletus from The Simpsons.,7
It's hilarious how the commentators are almost pleading with Samson not to throw away his wicket. To keep his composure because RR are in control and there's no need to take any unnecessary risks..,13
there were people in this thread suggesting samson was playing worse than tiwary for seeing himself in for 20 balls,4
"If Bumrah is going for runs, this game is done.",6
"39 of 30, Boult better take a hattrick now",4
Watching someone as good as Bumrah get tonked makes me tres happy,4
Fuck Yes Sanju fucking sexy bicep,15
Alrighty then GN all. Looks like no one will be biting their naila tonight.,4
Sanju biceps oooff 😩,7
"Bumrah hasn't regained his mojo, eh. Props to Sanju. Hopefully an apology thread incoming.",2
"With this quick 50, how much dent has Samson made on that ""2nd half of IPL"" stat?",7
goddamn this is satisfying to watch,5
"Yes Sanju, show them.",3
Good stuff,2
This is what MI fan's feels every even year and at start of tournament.,7
Happy for Samson,7
"OK that celebration for 50 was awful

Mumbai Indians are overhyped. KXIP and DC have better attacks than us,1
We just jizzed now!,6
"What an over from Bumrah!

This is why he is #1",4
Alright. i need to find the psychiatrist Sanju hired,6
This is the RR I have wanted to see. I knew they had it in them to do something like this,7
"Sanju is god

Sanju for Indian team",5
That's a cool celebration by Sanju S,9
"Excellent over as well, good to see they didn't try to block out Bumrah",4

Everyone's winning...except us,7
"Sanju flexing arm

I have so much PTSD I can't even clap this absolutely sublime Samson masterclass,3
"Boult vs Stokes, wait a minute, where have I seen this before",8
"Finally, 20Cr is paying off!",2
This is why MI needs rohit,2
Stokes and Samson carrying on this form will be huge plus for RR,6
"I feel Samson just needs the right backing and mentorship, clearly there's nothing lacking in his talent and technique.",11
"Man, if only our batsmen batted like this yesterday.",6
"Gee, this IPL has gotta be the most competitive in a long time. There are no punching bag teams and results are not very predictable. Anyone can win on their day.",8
Top 3 teams all lost this weekend. Outside chance of one of top 3 not making playoffs has certainly increased now.,3
"Although im really enjoy watching this,im still concerned about our bowling for the next matches.",3
Stokes to Smith: Bat kiska hai? Jiska bat uski batting..chal chal zyada phantom mat ban,2
Save nrr somehow,2
And fuckers on r/cricket wanted a nerf,4
The top 3 teams losing games that they're were supposed to win easily.. What is going on.. And with all 3 of them playing each other.. The 3rd playoff spot just opened up.. Except CSK and SRH... All 6 teams are looking good,1
give an over to chubby,2
"Lmao CSK fans can't catch a break.....the day they won a game somehow, they are getting eliminated from the tournament. But funny things have happened in this tourney.",18

Dafaq?,2
a well set Stokes on 73 vs Boult hmmmmmm ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),11
They've made chasing look so easy,5
Rajpoots hardwork in vain.,7
"Even though this means csk mathematical chances are  over today ,it still good to have a win over rcb and seeing mi defeat.",7
Only 1 over from Bumrah remaining. This is all RR now.,3
Danny Morrison just came,1
Almost thought Boulty was about to [bowl this delivery](https://youtu.be/Pw3SkcYdXfQ) again,3
Swann's support for RR is so wholesome,10
Out of all the dream 11 advt in which they are playing cricket. Rohit sharma advt with that Chake vali chair vala guy is one of the best. Even Rohit sharma does decent acting in it.,5
"Clever from Boult, can't get hit for runs if you don't bowl the ball",10
"If you listen closely, you can hear Indian cricket heads furiously typing ""Samson for India"" tweets.",11
RR have the best jersey imo. Where can I get one from?,1
Danny M just came all over the comm box when the Altroz appeared on screen.,3
SMASH THAT FUCKING CAR WINDOW BEN,6

Stokes now trying to get another 100.,3

It’s RR to lose now,1
Good reality check for MI after they had a walkover from CSK,8
Will they even need Buttler?,3

Very good running. Stokes is running out of gas it seems. When is the timeout? next over?,7
Haven't seen such a perfectly paced huge run chase in a long time.,10
Boult having flashbacks of World Cup,6

MI gonna take the shit out of RCB after this loss,3
RIP Pollard's unbeaten captain streak.,12
Stokes deserves a century here.,8
Dugout commentators are at another level. Board comes up Boult vs Stokes in T20s dismissals and they are saying one of them was from WC super over last year. FFS.,4
Dammit so now RR and KXIP are winning hearts. Who do we want #4 now?!,6
Wtf is Danny saying,2
"Our intensity in the field seems off from ball one today, maybe we were too casual",10
"Srh fans seeing rcb dc and mi loose and realizing we are playing rcb dc and mi next...

Only unlike other teams we are too trash to win",6
"Not only they are going to win, they also get a boost in NRR.",5
"Chasing has become easier.. Rahul chahar was the unsung hero...very economical, getting crucial wickets...but when bowling second it skids on simply...No purchase for the seam bowlers also...but you have to go out and hit no matter what credit to RR

This match will reinforce the chasing sentiment",8
" Top 2 is lava

RCB lost to meme team

Imagine doubting Benjamin Fucking Stokes,9
Rohit:missing me?,3
Petition to dissolve the fab 4 and replace it with Big Ben,13
Why does Swann sport RR so much? Genuine or is he trolling?,8
MI will be 1-6 against RR after this match in last 7 encounters. Mumbai never show up against Royals.,11
"Lmao, dc mi and rcb couldn't capitalise to get to the top of the table",12
Absolute shit fielding placement,6
Mumbai is getting wrecked and I'm just lovin' it.,16
Didn’t expect this chase from RR. Exceptional performance by them. Morally they have already won today.,13
Fuck all time out.,7
This is a chasing masterclass. This should be converted into a course for cricket academies.,13
I don't think they can choke this now.,4
MI have bowled poorly; worse than RCB earlier today.,6
DON'T JINX HIS CENTURY YOU FOOLS,3
"It is fitting, the 3 H2H games between MI, RCB and DC will decide who finishes in the top 2.",7
"If Benjamin gets the ton, I might just nut",11
Boult has crumbled due to his ptsd from bowling the white ball at Ben,9
This isn't MI we are watching tonight.,5
Will this cause a huge dent in MI's nrr?,0
Go on lad get this century 👏👏👏,5
RR is MI killer can confirm,5
Stokes finishing with a 4 through covers please,3
RIP 2% chance of CSK to qualify :(,7
The commentators cumming over a shitty golden car has to be one of the cringiest things of the IPL.,8
I kinda want Boult to bowl Stokes out,5

Top tier sunday already.",11
F 24 in 24 .. who would have thought??,3
"This match is perfect example of why you need to attack from the start, puts the bowling team under pressure and they make more mistakes",9

stokes gonna get a century folks 😍,3
This is gonna be bad loss for MI. They look so complacent. Maybe it's the dew that's making it hard for the bowlers to execute their plans.,5
Man RR have bossed this chase. They were almost always 10 rpo at all stages of the game.,10
Poor CSK will be back to the bottom once again.,4
So will Stokes open for England now in T20s?,7
So all the top 3 lost their matches. Things finna get interesting now,6
Still one over from Pollard/Krunal/Chahar,2
MI has given up. Fuck it. Time to forget this bowling performance and start fresh for the next game.,8
MI's bogey team is RR.,10
Boult bowling to Stokes a crucial over and Butler in the dougout. I think it looks familiar 👀,11
"Yesterday eveningn I thought delhis top 2 chances are fucked, I rest a little easier after today's games lmao",7
where is the collapse we were promised?,11
"14 out of 24, Stokes 100! What a treat today!",5
Last 4 overs 65 runs. Run rate 16.25.,7
Now comes the difficult part run a ball.,5
Amazeballs partnership. And really the batting unit on paper turned up. Even Robin and Smith were positive and had good starts,9
Stokes farming the strike because he wants a century lmao,12
Thank you RR for showing every other team that MI can be beaten,11
"Scotty: "" join me at night tommorow"" ಠ_ಠ",6
RR please don't choke,6
25 of 25 with 8 wickets in hand? A cakewalk for other teams. But a neck-to-neck game for SRH.,50
Stokes hitting Boult around in a tight finish? Where have I seen this before?,19
Any chance both KKR and KXIP can lose tomorrow? :'(,11
Gill is not the X factor. Please. Don't even.,11
Thank god. Stokes needed that break. Timeout actually being useful for once.,15

"For those of you saying Pant hasn't performed for India, Samson hasn't even performed in domestic cricket.",8

Mad Stokes is the best Stokes.,6
Boult is just southee 2.0,0
Maaro BC jam kar.,2
> They've got 50 off the last three overs. Stunning counter-attack 39 needed now off 30. They've fluffed a chase from exactly that equation against DC earlier this season. Things looking different so far tonight.,3
Come on where is the mi that played against csk day before,2
"Me as KKR fan after winning DC match, now we have match against kxip,rr and csk. If we lost kxip match, we can defeat other 2 and get a spot in playoffs.

Me after watching csk and rr thrashing their top 4 opponents: kxip looking fairy easy but don't know if we will able to win against csk and rr.",4

What’s the Q&A tab all about in the app?,0
"2 years ago, also against MI - Samson hit 2 sixes to finish the game with Buttler at the other end on 90*. I have never forgiven him.

If he does the same thing to Stokes today - he’s dead to me.",10
KKR vs KXIP tomorrow...holy shit.,5
Where did Mumbai go wrong??,1
"Stokes back in form tonight, Maxi back in form tomorrow? :D",12
How does Nescafe come up with such brilliant adverts every damn time??,2
MI RCB DC all three lost the opportunity to build a lead on top of table and these three are playing each other next week. This is going to be interesting,14
Lol Mumbai fans who were talking about how they can get to 250 score at the break. Sure you can lads but i am not sure you can defend it!,10
Ishan Kishan's 37(36) has cost MI this match,11

Glad samson hasn't given into the rhetoric of playing 'sensibly' which curbs his natural game. Players like him need to be nurtured. We've all seen what's happened to Pant with all of that pressure.,1
"I have to say that if the BCCI allowed Indian players to play in foreign leagues then Samson would be a multi-millionaire many times over.  
He is inconsistent but when it comes off it is just...a force of nature.",6

As someone who grew up watching Indian cricket from the late 90s nothing in cricket gives me more happiness than the bowling of Bumrah and Shami. Yes we have Virat and Hitman carrying on the legacy of Sachin and MS achieving more as a captain than Dada but having world class Indian pacers definitely seemed like a pipe dream. And Bumrah is only 26.,16
"If I don’t see yet another Stokes 100 in a chase considered hopeless, I’ll get upset. He deserves it.",23

MI fans are fucking crazy their team is losing only 1 game and still they are getting mad,29
"The top 4 could come down to RR vs. KXIP, KXIP vs. KKR, and KKR vs. RR.",9
Still can't believe Chris Jordan played absolutely lights out to win that game for KXIP the other day,13
MI lacks heart to win close matches. They either get smashed comprehensively or win one sided,3
We would have bowled Rabada the 20th over here and we still win matches lol,4
"The one fucking day I decide to watch the whole match, MI decide to shit the bed with their bowling... Fuck this...",5

Let's just pack it up and end it for the day. It's just not our day. Everything is going wrong for us.,2
Chasing this without Buttler even getting a chance till now has been the most impressive feat about this chase,17
Taking Bumrah for 38 ain’t bad.,6

A fully fit Delhi slaps this Mumbai side,3
How is CSK knocked out if RR win today?,3
"Smith has struggled to play a substantial knock this year, I think he should come down the order and win close games for his team like he used to do with Faulkner few years ago.",3
It seems Rohit has become a bigger unit over the past two matches.,4
So do you think unadkut will come back in the next match?,3
Holy fuck this game,9
"Pant fails, Samson comes back to form ...",5
"2nd best chase, first was too by RR.",7
Trent Boult made Stokes think it as CWC19 final all over again. Now see what happened.,3
Nothing makes me happier than seeing mi get absolutely thrashed. Go rr :),5

Top 2 is lava 😂,7
"Calling it NOW - 

Stokes & Samson will be crucial in today's game for RR.",9
Well looks like we're done and dusted tonight. That was a thumping victory. RR waged a Halla on MI bowling. Congratulations RR for victory and staying alive.,3
"Tomorrow's game is massive, the game with the highest stakes so far. On a separate note, the top 3 are all tied and play each other once, like a mini round robin. Love how this season has shaped up!",9
Pollard with that belly looks like a traffic cop at a busy intersection in Mumbai.,6

This Sunday has not been as taxing on the blood pressure as last. However it has set up some potential fun matches next week.,3
Buttler looks done with life,10
plz Stokes we want that 100 :(,5
[deleted],4
"Samson is doing a typical Indian thing (being a gracious partner) now for past few balls only taking a single to let his partner get to 100.

That is very ""Indian"".",7
"Chased down almost 200, Buttler wasn't even needed??",9
"Fucking hell Swann, never try a Kiwi accent again.",4
Butler is so bored,7
"boult can you let the guy reach 100,,, he’s kiwi ben",8
"Man, our bowling has been garbage today. Oh well, take this on the chin and get better.

At least all the other top teams lost too ....... so we're still #1.",2
Atleast we’ll be seeing the end of those “how csk can still qualify” posts,12
Stokes proving he is the second best all rounder in this team behind Jof,9
This is a great chase against the best team in the tournament. And Buttler hasn't batted. Silver lining is Rajasthan winning eliminates CSK.,6
goddamn can we please bring the licensed music to post-2010 atleast?,6
Mumbai's bowling is so meh other than bumrah,-3
"Jos is so fucking done, makes me feel sad",10

"After SRH bottled this yesterday, anything is possible",5
Everyone who was doubting Stokes didn't see the test summer. You could literally trust ben stokes with your life.,17
wholesome sanju letting ben get the ton,3
This match is a bit similar to the 2016 T20 WC SF,2
seeing how easily rr have gone about this makes jofra's overs look even better,3
Boult smile 😍,12
100 marega Mera bhai,2
"Gud job pattinson blocking that boundary, helping stokes get his ton",2
"CSK management looking at table later tonight: We won but we still last, MI lost but they still first. Its all about NRR, we need to play for NRR.",9
Stokes is actually gonna score shithouse singles to get there isn't he,14
Just take those singles please....my heart cannot take Ben Stokes getting out now,8
Trying to think of the most recent masterclass in chasing other than today...Bangladesh against West Indies in the WC? Or what?,7
Boult gonna get Stokes out before 100 as a consolation for all the time he has ruined his day,10
Ok Bois. We lost this game to keep CSK at last on points table. All is well,11
Boult for a redemption arc pls,2
Record for highest chase at Abu Dhabi is 166. Yet.,7
Clenching so hard right now.,7
Bring your century with a Six,3
 The utter ease with which these two chased this total down cannot be good for SunnyG' heart.,6
"People talking about ""fully fit DC"", just reminding you that Hardik is playing as a specialist batsman this season. His 4 overs would make this team even stronger in coming seasons",3
I wonder if ENG and NZ player can even look at each other without playing the worldcup final in their head,9
Mandatory RR finishing at 6th place in league stage. Calling it early.,11
Dhawan had a knock like this and we didn't even manage 160,29
"This is a horrible idea. One of them should hit the ball and try to finish the game as soon as possible - NRR is important and for a team like RR, it will play a role. This is the opportunity to improve their NRR but instead they're taking it slowly.",16
"MI fans please don't be reactionary. Our bowling just had their worst day. This side has real quality, we can certainly win this IPL. Just continue supporting them as we always have.",17
"Damn the competition is spicing up in the second half, Top 3 teams are losing",6
"LMAO MI bowling misfires one match and all of a sudden they went from deadliest bowling unit to ""meh""?",25
Redditors furiously typing up the write up for the Stokes apology thread,20
DC's bowling line up has been more clutch than MI's but their batting lineup is not the same level as MI. RCB still too reliant on 2-3 players.,17
Good over by Boult,2
My heart can't take this. Stop toying with me Benjamin,9
No super over please !!,7
"RCB MI DC tri series. 

We are back in 90s- 2000s

And the winners get to have 2 virtual finals

If only Commonwealth bank was sponsoring this",11
Boult getting anime-style PTSD flashbacks right now.,8
What position would be CSK if we sort out only the NRR?,2
"If there was one team who could chase 195 with the kind of bowling line up Mumbai has, it had to be Rajasthan.",7
Punjabi vs Bengali- contest going on since centuries 😄,3
cameraman just looks for girls doesnt he?,9
So RR is the only team with a winning H2H against Mumbai? Seems so...untrue,6
"Wow, it's weird that suddenly bottom placed teams are defeating top placed teams. Twice in one day...

It's like the top places teams don't want to get too far from the bottom placed teams in the interest of not deciding the top 4 early in the the time table and keep audience interest in the matches alive!",5
Do we go back to call him Sir Ben Stokes?,3
"I just want Boult to bowl to Stokes and Buttler. But ain't gonna happen anymore. Ah well, 3 more Benjamin!",0
Yass my boi,1
And this is without Tewatia coming to bat yet.,3
YEEES,2
24 off 24 needed now they still need 10 from 12. These run a ball chases gets complicated  easily,1
"STOKES 100 

YEAH BABY",3
Yes Ben.,2
Long live the queen,1
"This will be a very convincing defeat of MI in this season. Kudos to Stokes and Samson!!!

MI field placement looks way off and defensive today.",3
Boults face be like “ how lucky is this mofo “ after beating stokes,1
Ok as much as I love a century win should be first in priority,3
Big dick energy from the big guy,4

Ben Stokes is a great??,2
"At the start of this IPL everyone was beating everyone, then it turned into the bottom 4/5 getting absolutely pummelled, and now it's evening out again at the end",12

RR beating MI with Buttler not even coming out to bat. Just 2020 things .,21
TAKE A BOW SON!!!,2
How th fuck did RR win this with 10 balls to spare!!!,8
2 good overs can do it for MI but its less unlikely than CSk making it to playoffs,2
Clean chase,7
Stokes 😭😭,6
why does he keep scoring 100s in tough chases??,5
Well played Stokesy well deserved 👏👏👏,3
Stokes bringing his century with a Six is the ultimate fuck you to his doubters (where are the sixes),11

Stokes with another memorable innings. He can't do no wrong.,8
Lmao Rohit looks exhausted.😂,10
Hardik pandya who?😜,11
Its amazing how the top 3 maintain the same w/l ratio,8
"Guy totally out of form before this game completely makes a mockery of a chase of almost 200, that is IPL.",15
So CSK is knocked out I guess,8
This is Pollards first lose as a captain.,8
RR should strip captaincy away form Smith and give it to Stokes. Man's literally just walked in and changed the confidence of the entire team with this knock..,11

So the official line is uhhh.. no mercy with CSK and effectively ending any playoff chances, obviously. Got it? Good.",17
Rohit looks deppresed every time they lose. Lol,12
"as per traditions, what is the nrr?",5
Stokes has 2 IPL centuries now. One of those players who would be 3x aggressive as a batsman and 2x the bowler if he ONLY concentrated on limited overs formats but I like that his focus is test cricket and rightly so,14
Man of the match - rajpoot for giving that much runs so sanju and stokes can get back in form.,18

How this man always manages to turn up when the chips are down is a mystery that I probably won’t figure out for the rest of my life.Great innings from Samson too, played at a good rate even though he was the support role.

I wonder if RCB can qualify with 14 points. Looking at next few games it might get tougher for them.,10
RR has won 5 of 6 against MI,8
Rr on 6th position.  Can they qualify?,2
Superb partnership between Stokesy and Samson. Samson supported Stokesy so well with that quickfire half-century. Absolute delight to watch!,11
kkr could eye top 2 now while worrying about top 4,5
"""B...BUT ONLY BUTTLER CAN SAVE RR NOW !! , should open today"" 

BEN STOKES : HE HE .",19
"Our NRR goes from +1.448 to +1.252

RR NRR goes from -0.62 to -0.50",9
"*Pollard has never lost as a captain, Stokes hasn’t hit a six yet*

Thanks experts!",39
"Ben ""never gives up"" stokes",7
This is  one of those days which  RR thinktank dreams of.,9
"Stokes probably got pissed seeing Boult

*World Cup Final flashblacks*",12
Rajpoot gave Stokes a century today,6
"RR only plays in 2 difficulty settings.

Adventure story or Iron man",10
"Highly unimaginative captaincy from Pollard? I did not see a plan in place. And the fact that we have two leg spinners isn't helping us either if we have a well set left handed batsman like Stokes. 

Plus I'm still frustrated by the leg stump lines we bowled. So many run came just via a flick down the leg side. 

Also we need Rohit back. I feel with his experience we would've dealt with this situation much better.",0
"Agh fuck, MI probably are gonna try and fuck us over out of frustration of this match.",14
"This throws RR in the mix with KXIP and KKR for the no4 spot and all of them gonna play against each other next week 
 
Exciting times ahead!",9
Perfect chase rr has those superstars in their batting department to win matches single-handedly just Smith captainship and their management being clueless cost them,8
A hundred not out against the best bowling attack and under a lot of pressure. Welcome back Stokes.,14

Lord dropped that catch on purpose. He knew what's gonna happen today.,10
"I'll let Stokes have his moment, but ma boi Rajpoot scored a 60(24). None of this would be possible without him.",8
"Top 3: Trying to claim the Top 2 spot. 
Everyone else: I don't think so.",13
"""Haar gaye Ben Stokes"" - Hardik after the match prolly.",7
Looking at SRH now to save us from bottom of table finish. Looks like Punjab and Rajasthan have deserted us in our time of need,12
This shows when you have nothing to lose you have everything to gain.,3
"And with both RCB and MI losing, all the shortcomings of our defeat yesterday, got undone today.",6
Lol 80% runs where scored behind the wicket keeper,5
Wow Pollard is so eloquent,4
r/Cricket keep making apology threads for players. It's Ben tonight.,9
Is there a chance where one of the top 3 teams dont make it?,2
[deleted],38
CSK have been eliminated for sure now with RR winning this one.,9
Rajpoot apology thread. This guy is the reason we have able to witness such a inning.,21
No team is OP and no one need to nerf anyone. Thank god those comments will take few days off now.,1
Samson has just figured out that you have to watch the ball before hitting it lmao.,23
So is both 3rd and 4th spot open for teams after this ?,14
Barring Rajpoot it was a good day for Royals all around. Tyagi had given only 18 of 3 before that horrible last over,10
Sanju Samson is so humble. Respect to you sir.,22
IPL scriptwriter is messing with all of us,11
"All of the Top 3 teams have the same fixtures remaining - SRH and the other two sides. 

MF SRH could legit knock one of the teams out.",13
Ben Stokes... remember the name,10
Keyword: INTENT™,9
"Pandya's stint as ""best-pace-bowling-allrounder-who-is-not-fit-to-bowl"" came to end within an hour lmao.",14
Funny that CSK finally got eliminated the day they actually ended up winning.,36
sanju is cute af,14
"DC, RCB, and MI all lost. This is pretty hilarious and awesome to watch.",19
Mumbai Delhi and Bangalore have to play against each other that mean high Chances one of them might not qualify,5
I think even Harsha Bogle can captain RR as the only skill required is to talk at tosses and post conferences 😜,24
"Phenomenal batting from Stokes/Samson. I wish RR played better couple of matches before. They have talent to easily make the semi finals but just did not perform most of the tournament. 

So with the top 3 losing their last game, race to Top 2 and Top 4 continues to be in play. Tomorrow's match is critical especially for KXIP. A loss to KKR could kill their chances for qualification. A win would put them in a strong position.",11

"So the Top 2 comes down to the games the Top 3 play with each other,",5

Script writer inflated deflated CsK today,23
"MI against other teams : 🦁

MI against RR: 🐈",48
Harsha's definition of a good game is a high score chase where bowlers get mauled left and right. For me it's a low scoring thriller.,12
These bhenchods from Delhi better get their shit together and secure the top spot now. I am actually getting sick of their stupid captaincy and management costing us an easy top spot.,32
Let's not forget the CSK Fan's Calculations going nowhere after this match 😂,17
"Well played Stokes. Brilliant 100. Sanju bby, it's good to have you back.",23
Alexa play Bekhayali on repeat :((((,9
I expect to see a lot of match fixing comments now.,16
I am losing hope that MI would finish top 2 with the type of performance they have shown today with the ball,5
Only if we would play half as good as today in the rest of the tournament... don't have much expectations but would love to see RR finishing at the 5th spot at very least....,19
And CSK fans were happy because they were not at the bottom lol Great win RR !,10
Why isn't Neroli Medows not presenting anymore?,3
SRH and RR in same boat now,5
Rohit selling mutual funds to Samson and Uthappa,20
"pandya to bishop during the mid-innings interview: remember the name.


as if he had won the match lol. sorry mate, stokesy's brilliance and samson's grace is what we will remember from this match",24
As soon as Hardik came out to interview after first innings I realized MI was gonna lose. This has to be planned (not fixed but planned) because why would they get the man of the match (if  MI won Hardik would be MoM) to interview if they didn't already know he was going to lose? I think this is planned stuff like WWE,-37
"Sanju Samson: *exists

Commentators: he talent",25
"1 fucking shit match and r/cricket acts like they have lost and choked and lost in the worst way possible and are total losers and have not won a single title.This r/cricket is becoming like Facebook and instagram page where people's opinion change within a match.Then if y'all continue to do that,we will not be different from the Facebook and Instagram cricket fans.",26
"Two of last 3 matches of the league  are RR vs KKR and DC vs RCB, maybe those matches might decide the top 2 and top 4 spot, RR vs KKR might become a copy of MI vs RR 2014 game cause the NRR difference between the two is just 0.03",3
YOU CAN NOT DO THAT BEN SKOKES!!!,26
I don't know how fantasy points work but 164 points seems like a lot,10
"Simon Doull said a couple of days ago that teams should consistently play their best 11 and not their most expensive or fancied 11. Cummins yesterday and Stokes today, safe to say that both of them proved him very wrong.",23
By this rate rajasthan management will make even another Englishman in jofra a successful opener.,25
Stokes didn't bowl today and got a century,16
The dream 11 trophy has to be the shittiest trophy in the world.,10
MI needs to find better spinners. Krunal ain't working,10
Rajpoot ass saved here,21
It was only a few hours ago that there was a Ben Stokes failure thread !,18
These award ceremonies always crack me up lol,18
How is our NRR is still so high,7
MI has pretty much lost this season. They have no bowling.,-15
Who was the fucker in Last CSK match who told to open with Ishan Kishan permanently and replace Rohit with Polly as captain.Now tell!!,13
Ben Stokes first player to score two IPL centuries in successful chases btw,42
[deleted],8
CSK : Jeet ke haarnewale ko bazigar kehte hai or something,20
Lads please stop comparing IPL with el Clasico. Sounds really forced and derivative. Think something Desi. Like Mahabharat/Ramayan/ghamasan/gandfad or any cringey title AajTak puts on their Cricket shows,18
"Lmfao when MI's innings ended, all this talk about ""IPL's best bowling side"".. lmfao

This is why you shouldn't get so overexcited, ladies and gentlemen.",14
"Steve, stop calling Hardik, HARD-DICK !!",19
Stokes and Hardik's mantelpieces won't survive this haul of trophies.,15
"That BLM celebration, over confident interview and then dropped catch cost MI the match. Drop this wannabe",-10
Give a tough competition to other teams RR .,9
[deleted],0
"Stokes is the ultimate team player

Won't even celebrate his century in the interview as he feels he should have done it 3 games ago when RR could still qualify easily

What a legend",87
What happened to Stokes' family?,9
What happened to stokes’ family? Thoughts and prayers?,6
"DC - I lost 

RCB - same here brother

MI -  We are partners

Lol whenever they lose , they lose together",35
Wait why did the presenter say 'prayers for your family' to stokes?,11
"These MI thirsty fans making a huge scene for no reason. You've won 4 IPL seasons, give it a break. We need other teams winning to make the IPL more interesting. This season ain't your season.",25
"Looking at the matches lined up... No wonder people call IPL scripted... Top 3 teams fighting out each other and playing SRH (who can be party spoilers to at least one of teams).. KKR and KXIP match is a virtual 4th place match.. And with RR up against KKR and Punjab in the next match, they're basically still in contention.. Too much excitement.. Hope KKR loses tomorrow and things get interesting",20
"I know there's nothing wrong in it, but I'm not a big fan of presenters asking players about personal tragedies during interviews/ after the match. I remember Rashid was asked to speak about the Afghan player who passed away as well. 

It should be left as a voluntary choice. Like, unless the player wants to dedicate the win or talk about the tragedy, don't bring it up. IMO it's hard to watch them suddenly be hit by a truck of sadness.",62
Fuck fuck fuck what the fuck happened to top 3 are they gonna fuck why are they choking seriously from god to fuckera,21
"Man, the story of the bottom half of the table is really heating up. This is still, not wide, but still open. How does this Rajasthan win affect/effect Kings XI's chances?",6
"Pickard : ""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is CSK-life.""",11
Petition to bring back Rohit pls,5
"CSK defeated RCB and RR defeated MI.

On Monday, if KKR defeats KXIP and on Tuesday if SRH defeat DC; there will be 4 teams with 14 points. Then that would be a great competition for the top two spots.",11
"Bottom 4 to Top 4  -

Yeh main kar leta hu, aap Dream11 pe team bana lo!",33
if kkr win tomorrow ipl isnt scripted,13
"Rohit is like salt,whenever he is there we will not appreciate him but when he is absent we miss his presence dearly MI is incomplete without Rohit",33
Bruh. Conspiracy theorists saying Mumbai lost on purpose to knock CSK out. Lol,37
Ben Stokes good,19
MI loss removes/eliminates CSK.Bruh 4D chess by MI.,42
Couldn't saw this match and slept after first half....now I m gonna sleep for all RR matches.🤩,9
Ben stokes: I justified my name today by doing ben stokes of mumbai.,20

"That Kings XI v KKR matchup is looking pretty tantalizing. Huge matchup in the scheme of things. Come on Kings XI; Pooran is gonna bring the power, Gayle is gonna bring the grit (and entertainment of course), KL is gonna bring the style, Shami is gonna bring the pace and Bishnoi is gonna bring the bamboozle. Come on boys!",20

"MI have next 3 matches with RCB, DC and SRH damn",22
[deleted],43
"Some MI fans should admit that Rohit Sharma is as important as any other MI player. Degrading him won't make you look cool. He has lead you to 4 trophies, so you should respect him.

Imagine many MI fanboys were asking MI to drop Rohit, because Pollard is an undefeatable captain. Rohit as a captain is more important to MI, than Rohit has a batsman.",27
Can RR still make it to playoffs?,22
"Saurabh Tiwary should go to a team where he can regularly play for. He is really unlucky to be just a replacement player for MI. He is in good form and could have really proved himself in this season, with more number of opportunities in some other team.",29

"God damn, for the next 2 days everywhere I go on Social Media, I will see posts like ""Why isn't Samson in the Indian Team""",15
Multiverse Boss Tewatia orchestrated the whole Ben Stokes innings by dropping Pandya's catch. 6D chess masterstroke,6
