"Guys I have a theory about that Ajio ad that plays during the game.

That girl is mentally disturbed and just spends her days looking at a screen and imagining things everytime that Covid news plays on her screen.

Ad number 1: she lives alone and has no friends. So she buys branded stuff on Ajio and wears it and posts her photos on social media and gets happiness or solace by looking at imaginary likes and emojis floating on her imaginary social media account.

Ad number 2: she looks at her screen and it triggers another round of disturbance in her head as she ends up buying a gift for the only person who seems like a friend to her, the liftman. 

Ad number 3: she is looking at the news again when it triggers memories of her mom who has passed a long time ago. So she buys another new dress on Ajio and pretends like her mom is still around and they're dancing together. 

The end.",15

Oh it's matchday,2
Capitals_to_Daredevils.exe loading....,7
We are qualifying today,5
Hope Warner doesn't try to compensate his below par performance in this IPL in the upcoming series against India... Warner with a purpose looks very dangerous... 2019 IPL was brutal enough... We need to make him more softer and should keep encouraging him to make more tik tok videos... Come on SRH fans  show some more love towards Warner so that he forgets all his aggression...,3
Off topic but can you tell me is there any profession in commerce field  which requires negligible writing work?,-2
Go Delhi!!!!!!,4
Delhi sultanate vs hyderabadi sultanate,8
"Get Shaw in, Hetti at 4, Pant at 5. We shouldnt be facing the batting meltdowns then. Rest everything is fine, and we should have a decent chance",5
"Srh has to do a kxip and beat all 3 toppers to even have a chance of qualifying

Best of luck srh, I'm with u atleast with u in the dc and rcb game",5
"CSK, SRH and MI are the active teams yet to finish at the bottom of the table/win the wooden spoon .

Edit : Apparently, RR as well. For all their misfortune after their 1st season they've never finished below 7th.",6
Someone should probably whisper to Pant & Axar how they failed to make it to the national team just so they can get all riled up and perform today,7
"Either my boi pant will smash srh bowlers with anger

Or fail due to underconfidence",3
"If SRH can do a KXIP and beat top 3, they have a decent chance of making it to the playoffs with their NRR",2
"Ok DC,you have my blessings. I hope you win. I am sorry, I won't be available to watch your victory ;(",5

"Irrespective of what happens, I just want to see Warner take his rage out with the bat today. The way he looked after the defeat versus Punjab, I have never seen Warner THAT PISSED. Jesus he was genuinely fuming. 

Also the way he batted in the powerplay, coupled with what he said in the interview, gives me hope that the ultra aggressive Warner has always been alive, he has just most of the times ended up curtailing and controlling his instincts too much - for both Australia and SRH (of late). 

I just want a classic 2011/12 ish Warner innings lol I have missed Davey smash the fuck out of the ball so much, ngl. The two sixes he hit in the powerplay versus Punjab made me really happy.",8
"Rahane is Shaws Inconsistency with the Intent of Jadhav, if they pick him again we are losing this even before a ball is bowled",4
"Is it only me who is obsessed with my avatar?

lets go SRH!",5
I have a feeling Pant is going to absolutely maul Holder today.,5
Supporting DC to avoid wooden spoon,6
69th,2
Just want Pant and Warner both at their aggressive best.,6
Were overdue for a 200+ game. Hope it's a good one on both sides.,1
The OG DC vs Poser DC,5
I both feel bad for SRH that their remaining games are with the top 3 and excited about the fact that they have the potential to fuck up their plans.,2
Chasing again. Bold move would be a fucking understatement,1
DC opt to bowl,1
Uhmm.. why are we chasing again...,1
**K A N O S** is here.,5
Good changes,2
I'm scared. DC aren't good at actually winning games that they're favorites to win.,3
I was hoping Bairstow would play this game because Delhi lack a leggie.,4
At least this time we can die relying on our speciality : defending totals,1
"No offense to SRH but this is our best chance to get 2 pts and secure playoffs. But we are chasing, so we just made it difficult for us.",5
Yes lets drop our best batsman in our most important game,0
"Bairstow dropped, did not see this coming",3
Gosh. Get top 3 of SRH and game over.,1
Has dc ever won chasing apart from winning against the wooden spooners?,-5
Might Bairstow have played his last game for SRH?,-1
"Finally they dropped Bairstow!

I was begging here to drop Bairstow",3
"SRH have already lost the real game by dropping YJB

Distinct lack of units™ in the side now",3
"Kane HAD tp comeback now. Against us. Smh. Pack the bags bois, we ain't winning shit today",3
Love Johnny but defo the right decision... he’s been one of the best one day openers since 2017 but sure as hell not in this form,5
Good changes but would have still opted for Abhishek instead of Nadeem to add firepower in lower order and he is a decent bowler.,6
Yassss the changes I've fucking wished for. Finally SRH has grown a brain,3
"It's clench your buttcheeks time, hate it when Delhi has to chase",0
"KW picked in playing 11..

r/cricket: ᕕ(  ◕‿◕)ᕗ",44
"Even if Kanos fails these 3 matches( rare) , I'd still retain him over Bairstow",10
When did Bairstow become so weak to spin? He carted spinners all around the park in the World Cup and he smashed RCB’s spinners when he made a century last year.,11
Srh has always made changes that are good.  It's a shame they can't fucking win anything those losers. Happy bday Warner btw.,8
why is this chick asking silly cricket questions on hotstar?,6
It's time for us get ready for boarding the train.. **KANE TRAIN**,3
All eyes on Pant. He need to show the selectors why he is the real X factor,4
Would it be bad sportsmanship to repeatedly drop Rahane so that Pant doesn’t get to bat?,1
"Been saying ever since we lost 3 consecutive games that Bairstow’s time has come to be dropped. Yet we desperately persisted with him.

Have you guys seen how much he was struggling out there against spin ? Especially in the game against KXIP. It was painful to watch him.",2
Why no Khaleel? I thought he was a wicket taking bowler? No? or is he injured or something?,2
"With bairstow it isn’t a spin thing, it’s simply a form thing... for England in the summer he looked so much weaker than 2019 against all attacks",4
Kane for Bairstow is a bold decision. He shouldn't open imo. Samad should open and Kane at No 3 pls.,6
Saha big match player comeback,3
Let's go no Bairstow!,3
Warner opening with Saha or kanos? What do u guys think?,3
"Extremely Hot Take- Open with Pant cos he clearly is doing a role which Rahane is capable of doing, with PP he has all the freedom and could be best case of optimising the batting unit",4
"idk why SRH keep persisting with Samad over Abishek, he really hasn’t had one good innings yet",2
Why the heck do they pick Deshpandey? Won't Harshal Patel or Mohit Sharma be better options?,1
Just hope Saha makes 20(15) and gets out. He’s beyond useless after the powerplay.,5
[deleted],3
What's wrong with Abhishek Sharma ? Curious why he's not been picked ahead of Samad or Nadeem,2
"**DC in IPL 2020**

Win while batting first: 6

Lose while batting first: 2

Win while chasing: 1

Lose while chasing: 2

**SRH in IPL 2020**

Win while batting first: 3

Lose while batting first: 2

Win while chasing: 1

Lose while chasing: 5",5
I hope if they are opening with Saha then communication must have been just go and either smash the ball or get out. Even he would like to forget his last innings.,3
Mohit Sharma>Tushar Deshpande,1
Saha > every other young Indian keeper,4
Pant should be allowed to open so that he can play fearlessly. His mindless slogs will fetch plenty of runs in the PP too because the probability of him getting caught in the outfield is pretty low.,1
damn Shankar got hitched,2
IPL interview hai ya Koffee with Karan,1

Saha and opening?lol,2

"Saha HAS to open 

So that there middle order gets solid with Kanos,Pandey,Shankar,Samad,Holder",4
Welp! No Bairstow makes it so easy to not care about SRH today!,4
"Thank God Warner didn't win the toss, otherwise he would've chosen to bowl first again.",2
If Delhi beats us today they should be ashamed to order biryani from Swiggy next time. That's all I'm saying.,15
Axar Patel is such a happy happy lad. Answers to all questions whether smart or stupid with a smiling face.,5
Expect a statement game from Pant. 50+ at 180SR,5
I'm ready for Warner's birthday special innings.,3
It seems all the experts are puzzled by Bairstow's exclusion but every SRH fan wanted this change. Now let Kane open and Saha can bat at 5 if we lose 3 early wickets inside 8 overs or else he can come at 8.,6
I thought DC would always prefer Prithivi Shaw over Ajinkya Rahane!,3
"I strongly believe we could have won last game if it was Kane in there instead of Bairstow. Saha also playing would have helped us as he could tackle the spinners. 

This late move cost of us at least a game.",3

"Iyer has to remove his cap, that cap has been acting as his mortal enemy. Remove it and remove all problems /s",0
Embarrassed to say that I still have hope for srh for some reason,7
I don't think no other team fans worry about changes and batting lineup as much as our fans do,3
No Swanny tonight bruh wtf,4

"Beware, There's already a downvoter here.",1
"Considering his performance in last 4 matches, why is Ajinkya Rahane still in the team? and no one is talking about Prithvi Shaw. Am I missing something?",2

Birthday innings from Warner?,6
Was bairstow dropped or injured?,2

Kane to carry SRH's batting today.,2
"I think Warner will be in *fine, I'll do it myself* mode today.",10
Swanny absent from the dugout tonight. I feel like bawling like a little kid right now. 😭,9
Fuck SRH for dropping one of the most destructive white ball players right now. Similar to how they got rid of Ben Cutting. Kane Williamson is not destructive enough for t20. Can't chase 190+,-7
"I think Bayliss deserves a second chance and doesn’t need to be judged for this bad season. 

It’s his first time and he has to tackle personalities like VVS, who acts like he is “Donald Trump.”

I don’t blame him personally for hesitating to drop Bairstow.",5
"Hetti at 4, Stoinis at 5 and Pant at 6. Stop messing up orders man",5
"Everyone used to call out KXIP for not being able to close out game, but the fact that SRH are 7th with a positive NRR tells you a lot",50

"0, 35, 34, 26, 32, 5, 69\*, 57, 101\*, 106\*, 6

Shikhar Dhawan has been like a good old wine this season. Getting better and better every day.",5
Tushar has suffered severe confidence loss after Gayle messed him up though.,2
Wait they dropped Bairstow??,2
Bairstow got dropped for an indifferent season(although he had one big innings in there). Wonder what Maxi does to justify his place in the side? That too year after year,3
"YJB putting on a smiley face in the dugout, inside he's going through ways of getting his revenge.",6
KKIP supporters. We supported you guys till you reached 4th position. Now it's your turn.,7
Can Saha keep up with birthday boy Warner's running between the wickets? We're about to find out!,3
Why the fuck are they playing this relic instead of Shaw,3
"4 of the last 5 Orange Caps have been won by Warner/Kane. The one time an SRH batsman didn't win was when Kohli went 973 and even that year Warner was 2nd with 800+ runs. 

Goes to show how much SRH has relied on Warner/Kane duo.",105
I think we will let Saha run us over. Just like we did with Narine the other day,5
Some competence by the DC management by giving Rahane a proper chance.,-3
"I've said this before and I'll say it again.

Nortje around the wicket straight away to Warner. The Broad Plan.,2
Saha vs Pant for the wicket-keeping position in the Test team. Fight!,3

Good fielding by Usha Pandey,2
tushar will save 1 run now to concede 20 extra later,10
Rabada shares the new ball for the first time this season.,3
Only if Pollard was the fielder.,3
Saha scored a 55 ball 115 in 2014 IPL final he is not a bad player. On his day he can go big.,141
saha is warming up before india test tour,7
Oh wow. Thought they would give the batter the benefit of the doubt. Great save.,6
Wrintent Saha,4
"If SRH wins this it could be an interesting fight among KKR, Punjab & SRH for the 4th spot",11

Yes Saha justify your PP role,7
I'm sorry but this is intent ^™®©,11
">If DC win today does it mean that they become the first team to qualify?"" -- No. 16 points won't secure a playoff spot for the time being as up to five teams can potentially get to 16 points as of now.

If you look it up. Saha actually has one of the highest strike rates in the ipl.,12

"Who are we supporting today? An SRH win will make things more interesting,but not sure if I should hope for that.",4
"I came here, having finally caught up on all the various cricket podcasts and shows Sky and BBC put out in the last week to heap some praise on Jonny Bairstow and how refreshing he is to listen too in interview and how you can tell he’s genuinely invested and interested in every team and competition he plays in....

And he’s been dropped. Boo to you Sunrisers. Boo to fucking you.

Edit: as an unrelated side note: remember the 100 draft when none of the players on the sofa seemed that interested then YJB came along staring at the stats screen like a man into his 12th hour of scouting wonderkids on Football Manager.",5
Good to see some urgency being shown by SRH,5
Saha investment paid off already. Only profits after this.,8

Saha is my new best friend🤝,6
Saha garu.,5
I knew it we will make Saha a hero. Thats what we do. He will not make anything from next match,12
Job well done from saha if he can slog like this in powerplays. Builds perfectly for kanos and manish in the middle order,7
Bc har match me pitoge kya yar,6
So anyways he started smashing,9
Saha 🥵,9
Power seems to be missing from Saha's shots but his intentions are good. Iam liking it.,11
DC dont fuck up.,3
The fuck is that ugly ass facial hair on Ashwin. Should be dropped from the test team for that imo,-6
I feel today will be tushar's redemption.,6
Bairstow pissing himself rn seeing saha bat,1
Saha has not played any big innings for SRH but he has a S/R of 132 for the team. So he is not certainly a liability.,4
Out karo 😢,1
SRH have brushed up on their Ethics 101,2
Intent,3
I'll be genuinely mad  if we score 200+ today after we failed to chase 126 lmao,3

DC on a losing streak. Maybe it was a mistake to support DC.,4
DC's next two matches MI & RCB.,3
"Saha is known for this. He is good at exploiting powerplay and hit over infield. 

He doesn't have the power to muscle the ball late in the innings but is very effective when opening  to take advantage of the field restrictions.",4
God. Williamson is so handsome,5
"~~Sixer Shami~~

Super Saha",4
Think we need Marlon Samuels to do some guest commentating up. Shake things up a little bit.,9
"Reminder: Saha is 36 years old, nursed a recurring injuries for two years before making a comeback in the international scene last year.
After that, he is STILL runnin that fast between the wickets.",10

Somebody get that Saha out. I haven't picked him in my dream 11.,6
Scenes if DC somehow manage to slip out of the top 4,9
"Wow, mad disrespect",4
I'm starting to worry Delhi is gonna pull a KXIP 2018....,12
Why has this Saha not been played as a batsman before even with Bairstow?,5
We are just like the Indian team. Bang up front but then lose all the steam towards the business end.,3
Well played.,5

"first mi now dc, its the obligatory bowling fk up from top bowling teams",6
Saha could get out after pp and he still would have played phenomenal,13
I miss the IPL anthems being played loudly after each boundary / wicket,8
Saha is what Narine hopes to be opening the batting,15
Seems like every team is finding its form against DC in the last few games.,10
Good one from the dugout. Warner known as 'Shavey' Davey for his work on the cricket ball.,4
Wtf Pant,8
SRH need to make 150 in the first 10 so their middle and lower order can make 50 in the last 10,115
Totally loving the carnage rn,4
I feel like DC might have peaked too early,11
Confidence when I see Williamson in middle order is immense as srh fan,5
Fuck the dugout with all wicket alerts.,4
Srh should not have lost the previous match. Warner angry af,15
"They arent messing around, are they",5
Rabada and Nortje does well. Graeme Smith goes on Twitter like all praising tweets on SA bowling duo. Schedules 4 countries tour to SA this summer. Next 2 games Rabada and Nortje becomes toothless 😂😭😂😭,7

Rohan Gavaskar and Anjum Chopra on English commentary... switching to dugout.,3
Easy easyyyyy easy,4

Transfer saha to rr pls,4
"Ash goes: Humesha tomko Saha, Saha, Saha, Saha aur Sahaaaa ...",1
"Styris: I am backing the Shavy Davey to be the birthday boy today.

Lee: Why is he called Shavy Davey?

Styris: Probably for something he does on cricket field.

Styris is lowkey brutal against Australians .",9
"So, Iyer doesn't mind bowling left arm spinner to left handed batsman anymore? Ponting surely had a few words with him lol",2
Who took Rabada to cleaners?,5
Any info on why Shaw was dropped?,1
You know Pant's confidence is low when he's not making demonic screeches after every ball.,4
"Idk why everyone seem so surprised by Saha 

He’s pretty decent in the first six overs",5
This is how I always expect Finch and DDP to start but no,7
This just feels like a venting session for Warner after their previous match.,3
"If only Warner got a dollar everytime he readjusts his gloves' strap, he would have been a millionaire, lol.",1
After 2 years of good play. We are back to meme team,7
[deleted],7
Ajju bhai > jinx,4
Tuning out. Please tag me when DC decide they want to actually play.,5
Rahane or Shaw in today? Both will give us <10 runs so I suppose it doesn't matter anyway,5
Pant experiencing mixed emotions while witnessing this innings by Saha.,10
"Don't dread it, don't run from it, peak Delhi has arrived",5
"7th season in a row for Warner with 400+ IPL runs.

Last 5 seasons have been 500+ run seasons.
Mind you, KL Rahul this year became the *first * Indian batsman to score 500 runs 2 seasons in a row. 

IPL GOAT.",7
Saha is Bengali and KKR have wank Indian batsmen....,6
Warner vs Ushar Pandey is going to be juicy!,1
3rd wicket alert without result. Get fucked with your shitty alerts.,5
"Capital of india getting rekt by some random city

SRH scores all these runs in the powerplay just to get all out on 126 smh,8
Centurion opening partnership incoming.,1
"DC's last two games against MI and RCB, I'm really hoping they don't fuck this up.",2
Saha’s going to be deservedly backed again but I kind of wanted to see Bairstow in Sharjah damn,6
I think we'll make in the 160s as usual,6
Delhi Daredevils now,4
Pant kuch hard balls bhi pakad lo,1
What ground is this?,1
Saha scoring with a 200+ SR with Pant staring at his ass is peak madlad behaviour,82
Warner looked very determined last game as well like he is on a mission to take his team to playoffs. Unfortunately he got out after a good innings and his team fucked it up big time even when the equation was just 71 of 81 balls when he got out with 8 wickets left.,6
[deleted],0
Wtf is happening? SRH doing a 2016 again,6
Delhi Daredevils,25
STOP it. We're already dead.,3
S L A P P E D,3
Bowl bouncers or Yorkers. Do something other than bowling length balls. FFS,5
Seeing nokia and rabada get tonked makes me really happy,12
behenchod,3
"Yes, and this is how we get out of the playoff race",1
This is more like the SRH of the old.,7
Does Rabada only pick up wickets in death?,2
"This is why you should show same respect to Indian players as you do to your foreign players.

Teams like SRH and RR could do more about this",9
"SRH making Rabada and Nokia look so ordinary, I love it",3
"Saha at top is a different player altogether. In 2018 season, Saha and dhawan used to give explosive starts.",4
This is the Warner we love. 😘,6
Hey look Delhi Daredevils are playing,8
Purple cap bowler being smashed for boundaries is a fucking sight to see,5
SRH making a joke out of the DC bowlers,5
Been saying it. Saaha is good enough in powerplays to be picked ahead of YJB which enables us to play Kanos too. But people were more concerned about matchwinners than the balance and downvotes to hell. Now look at Saha boys!,2
Too much intent wtf 😳,4
Going after Rabada omg Warner here for the kill,3
Vintage Warner,2
The fuck is happening. Is this pitch a highway?,1
Sigh. If only we saw this Warner from the start.,2
reminder that rabada is 23 of 1.2 overs...,1
Rabada Rabada Rabadaa Baja...,2
Finally Warner playing his natural game.,2
Both openers playing at 200 SR,3
lmao DC doing KLPD to their fans once again... some things never change,3
Which side of the bed did Warner wake up this morning? He means business today.,5
"Bruh wtf. With Williamson, Holder, Pandey, Shankar, and Rashid left to bat and how we're bowling rn... we'll be chasing 200",2
Think its too late?,1
Lol a few SRH fans wanted Warner dropped.,4
"Nadeem is like the unwanted person we have in the team only to make it 11,  like we used to do in gully cricket",1
Warner probably stopped giving a fuck about SRH and is just trying to have fun on his birthday,3
Where is that fucker who said rabada is better than Archer,1
Does SRH have a chance of getting into play-offs?,2
Devudu,3
"Just tuning in, what’s going on. Warner on song on his birthday",2
In-form David Warner is a treat to watch.,4
"Calm down, Warner. You guys already killed them.",6
Warner is surely pissed af after last game😂🙏🔥🔥,9
Saha and now Warner taking Rabada to town.,3
Fuck yes aggressive Warner love to see,8
Rabada getting all of his scoring deliveries out of the way so that he can take 8 wickets in his last 2 overs,5
"2016 Warner vibes

Seriously, Tushar might be a specialist fielder today if Warner doesn't get out",2
Rabada's really getting destroyed bruh,5
Dubai is Sharjah for Warner today,6
"I fucking missed this Warner, where were you earlier",4
Warner :'D,1
Maybe Mishi bhai was the glue holding this team together,4
I missed this Davey,3
Oh my god,3
Godamn Warner is dealing in boundaries....,2
_Stop stop he's already dead._,5
I think im gonna tear up seeing warner play like this again after so long,5
Lodu lalit,0
"If delhi are chasing 200+, i wanna see pant open again. That insane ipl he had few years ago he was opening most games",2
Fun Fact: Rahul Tewatia has the same number of IPL centuries as Jos Buttler and Glenn Maxwell combined,-2
Rabada 💔,3
*Rabada ka kar diya Kabada*,2
"Who are these Rabada and Nokia kids that are playing. Never heard of them, are they club bowlers?",2
Calm down srh,5
Warner getting back into this mood just before the India series makes me very happy. Demolition mood.,7
Too good holy shit,4
Finally someone got the hang of Rabada in this season. He seemed unplayable till now (perhaps second only to Archer).,16
Belting RABADA is pure bliss,5
Bloody hell,2
Warner my man take a bow,3
"Birthday Boi!!!

DC summon Archer spirit form.",5
What's with Australian players and their birthdays...,2
SRH fans be like where were you this season,6
Demolished.,1
this is a welcome change. the dreaded DC pace battery getting smashed around the park.,3
Warner mama,2
Devudu not fucking around here,4
Why is Rahane playing? Is Shaw injured?,1
Warner God,5
Lol. 50 already.,6
Happy Fucking Birthday Warner,6
BC rehne de. Ek aad dot ball to khel le bc.,2
Finally some good fuckin T20 hitting!!,6
SRH-114 died so this Warner could be born.,6
That's a quick knock!,6
73 in the fucking PP?!,3
FUCKING MADDEST OF RESPECT TO WARNER,8
This is why I love T20 cricket,1
"There are two SRH teams batting in the same innings.

1-6: Chad SRH
7-20:Virgin SRH",3
Rabada enough with the short balls already jesus,1
Where was this Warner hiding?,3
51 times he has made a score above 50 in IPL,4
Whom should I support?,1
Terrible bowling tbh. Deserved to be tonked,3
Highest pp score this season?,2
Just stop he's already dead ಥ‿ಥ,5
Omg wow,4
Looks like the last match performance really pissed off Warner.,6
I'm not watching this match now. Gg wp.,2
69 Nice.,3
And that is why my flair is India.  Can't trust DC.,10
Vintage SRH vibes,1
warner UwU,3
Warner doesn't want to leave it to others today.,4
Can we skip this match? I dont wanna watch anymore,9
This is just incredible,3
Will probably come down who among RCB or DC will choke to lose out on a play off spot. At this form SRH will probably beat RCB.,6
Warner Miyaaaaaaan,5
What the actual fuck half century before power play is even over..,3
"Kagiso ""deshpandey"" Rabada",5
so good to see davey get on top of Rabada,3
Dude wtf happened to dc,5
RIP rabada,3
Davey ton up pls,2
Lara as usual getting his predictions right,3
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BUDDD,4
"Good to see Warner back at it again

He looks fuckin beautiful when hes just smacking everyone everywhere and not being an ""anchor""",8
Beating a dead horse.,4
Hott dammnn  it looks good when batsmen take the best fast bowler in the tournament apart,9
Guys what am I watching,9
Don’t SRH. Don’t give me hope again,8
Rabada two overs 37 runs lmao,3
Warner finally back in 2016 God mode,6
SRH smashing Rabada Nortje and RR smashing Jofra shows that no bowler should be feared.,2
HOLY FUCK I BOW DOWN TO YOU IDOLO,4
Nice,2
This is carnage. Never seen these figures for Rabada,5
Some midget love for rabada,4
Go go SRH! Beat DC and make the battle for the playoff spots more interesting!,6
If they go back to their old Delhi ways it's only fair for Pant to regain his form and carry this team again,4
Our highest score in pp?,3
Just when I thought Warner graduated to Thala status this season...,6
Village level fielding,3
Bruh Warner welcome back,4
Fuck.. Warner has turned it on here.. looking so good to watch,3
cant believe rabada is getting man handled like this,2
Damn Warner just bitch slapped one of the best bowling attack in IPL.,3
"I just tuned in, and now I regret doing that. Rabada bro wyd",4
Rabada ER of 18.5 smh,2
"Bruh that Rabada, could you please respekk?",4
22 from a Rabada over!,3
WTF?? almost 40 runs from 2 Rabada overs,3
This score is enough if srh was playing csk,3
What is this carnage I'm seeing?,2
"That six was off a good line and length delivery.

Warner on fire.",3
77 run power play holy,9
"For people who are first time following IPL:

This is David IPL Warner.",10
Warner be like : Are Abhi to party shuru hui h xD,3
Is it sharjah?,1
"Delhi can’t chase 160+,  SRH always defend 160+.

Just give us a quick death. Thanks!",5
Wow. I have no words.,5
Orange cap here he comes.,5
Do srh have a chance?,1
Will be difficult to win this for DC because of the intent shown by SRH. They are really going hard in a do or die match.,3
Rabada got rubbed hard,2
Fuck this,3
Vintage Warner on display 😍😍,5
Rabada going for 22 runs in an over. This has been a fantastic match already,6
bruh Rabada ded,4
Rabada taken for 37 off his first 2. Whoof.,3
"2-0-37-0

Even Siraj has better figures than this. Rabada is done. Drop him /s",6
Did rabada got fucked any game other than this game?,2
Rabada ka aaj nikal gaya kabada,5
"22 runs off Rabada. David Warner, you madlad.",3
Why are they playing spray and pray Rabada when they could be playing Harshal Patel instead?,3
Hows that four wtf warner,3
Warner sending Rabada to Dinda academy here,2
Tushar better start praying,4
Question of the day: Did DC peak so soon?,6
"Warner hits 22 runs in Rabada's over.

Imagine Tushar Deshpande's state of mind right now.",5
I am afraid DC is doing a reverse KXIP,6
Rabada 37 runs in 2 overs 😳,4
Wtf 50 in a powerplay. Unreal batting.,5
SRH big PP,7
Rabada = Siraj ?,1
"Wah behenchod, maza aagaya",3
SRH can go fuck themselves of they don't make 200 from here on.,5
"All this and Deshpande still hasn't bowled, lmaoo we're fucked.",7
"jaydev unadkat wearing a rabada mask

where can i find one?",5
Rabada's been cunted,3
C A R N A G E,2
Hitting the leading wicket taker of the tournament for 22 runs in 1 over. That's the prime example of Big Dick Energy.,5
The massive choke by srh that day completely revitalized Warner it seems,7
Tushar yet to bowl loooooool,3
Kagiso “Piyush Chawla” Rabada,2
This is fucking depressing.,5
Rabada 37 off 2... I never thought I'd see it,3
O Captain My Captain... Rabada scoring runs faster than Warner,4
We are playing Rahane just reminding and he is going to be facing the max balls in PP if he survives,3
rabada ka kardia kabada,3
Rabada 22 runs this over?!!! Wow!,6
David “I will just do it myself“ Warner,6
All that short run luck is catching up to haunt DC.,6
At least now I know why Iyer never brought Rabada to bowl earlier!,7
"Just tuned in. Whoa. Saha opening, and it worked. One of those decisions that would've been shit on if failed",7
"Have fun MI, RCB, KXIP and KKR.",6

Cricket is one sport where the greatests of the game are usually right with their predictions as well.,2
Oh my god this is carnage,6

"Warner absolutely cunting the saffers

Btw I missed the stats popup - Warner vs Rabada in T20s - who has the upper hand?",2
Iyer:Rabada let me down,8
Rabada got Warnered right there,4
Rababa going at 18.5 an over. Jofra archer would never 🤢🤢,5
I remembered Gilly’s semi final against DD in 2009,10
Anchoring never really suited warner. Glad he backed away from it.,9
Please Stop this Warner. Rabada's already dead,8
Is this the highest powerplay score this season?,6
"Warner is in the Birthday spirit lmao, smashing Rabada for 4 4s & a 6 is simply unreal.",10
"Saha's aggression is understated. 

Taken all the pressure of Shavy Davy",10
wtf Saha???,2
"Dugout showed faith by calling a big over and they won, coincidence?  I think not",6
Waiting for Tushar 'Popeye' Deshpande,2
Sahi hai,1
Saha with the added oomph to his batting has catalyzed David Warner into blitzreig,1
this game is absolutely PRIMED for a Pant century at this point,4
"So in replacing Bairstow with Saha, not only have they got a better WK but also a better Batsman ? :P",11
Bro.....Saaha!,1
God like placement by saha,7
"""I used to think DC was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a comedy."" - Mahatma Gandhi",7
"Thanks Iyer for bringing Warner back to peak form before the T20, ODI, Test series at his favourite hunting grounds 😒",2

Being a Delhi fan is good. It prepares me for the disappointed that we will get from our national team.,5
"5 teams can still get to 16 points, right?

Matches are really getting competitive. Love it",3
Saha - you all forget about me,5
So I think we can all agree that Archer >>>,10
Warner is playing like a wounded lion. They are really going hard in the do or die encounter.,12

Warner 150 incoming!! #GoOrangeArmy,6
"Woah, wtf is this score. Warner was mad af after choking away the last match. He looks hungry now",64
"This is exactly where Saha's difficulty usually starts. If he can keep going at the same speed, DC is in trouble!",7
someone get two three wickets now pls,-2
"I was rubbing one out with the match in the background.

Not any more. Cummies can wait. This is more important",13
Wanted to sweep it again lol,7
I guess Warner is still angry from that KXIP fiasco in the weekend,73
"There's a lot of things you can blame the bowlers for in that PP, but it's easy to forget just how intimidating Davey is in full flow.",10
I always find fielding first a negative move and this match further solidifies that belief.,-3
That sweep by saha was SOOOOOOO SWEEEEEEEEEEEET,11
Saha getting robbed by Warner . He is the one who destroyed Rabada.,10
What happens in DC loses,3
Delhi have gone the reverse 'peaking at the back end' of the tournament here.,14
Jordan >>>>>>> Rabada,2
Saaho re Bahubali,12
Incoming 200,6
You can count on SRH's middle order to undo all the  good work the top order has done. I won't be surprised if we end up at 150 after 20 overs.,19
Rashid's gonna fuck delhi up on this pitch,15
Warner honouring his mustache raped DC bowling,6
Commentators jinxing things big time with all their wicket alerts,6

Give a wicket alert every over and eventually there will be a wicket and you win.,9
All DC flaireds please switch your flairs to Delhi Daredevils. Because that's the team playing right now,11
This intent by Saha reminds me of his days with KXIP <3,5
Bhainchod imagine SRH & KXIP both go through and DC & RCB/KKR miss out lmao.. total scenes.,12
Free hits for Saha now,6
Warner looks hotter with his beard,7
Hey who is cutting onions here?,8
DC losing is bad for RR and KXIP.,5
Why are these moustache people always performing?,4
Is that Saha guy WC in test guy?,6
"Lmao what happened, just logged in. What'd I miss?",1
Saha is gonna come out of the break smashing and get out in the process,3
What is the highest score after powerplay ? Was it that innings where Raina scored 87 or something and CSK was around 100?,2
Deshpande yet to bowl lol,4
Odds on the bowler to break this partnership? A loose Stoinis delivery being mistimed and skied is my current bet.,1
See how much more comfortable Saha is against spin? We needed to bring in Saha and Williamson because of how well the spinners are going to do.,8
"DC, I TRUSTED YOU",2
What the hell is this hitting? Are we in SRH fans simulation?,2
"This is why the whole S/R is overrated doesn't make a ton of sense especially batting first. 

If you impose your will and look to hit first, defend second and play with intent™, it totally tanks the morale of the bowlers. 

Brilliant stuff from Davy and Saha.",7
Rabada Kabada Status: ✅,3
Warner channeling his anger from the last match's post-match presentation in this game.,5
"Warner is gonna gift himself a century for his birthday, isnt he?",4
Warner how you gonna cunt Rabada and not fucking Axar Patel :(,-1
SRH will be massively disappointed if they get anything under 200 after this rollicking start. A good game for Pant to show his worth after being dropped yesterday?,1
"Warner be like: Rabada, who?",4
DC gonna be stuck on 14 points.,-1
DC are shellshocked af. Iyer be all haha dry wicket guys let's choke em.,5
Lol this low 'Centre of Gravity' for playing spin better argument reminds me of an MI fan tweet. He said that Rohit deliberately gets fat to bring down his centre of gravity and thereby improving his spin game.,4
"that why play your natural game, anchor thing is bs",5
Delhi fans having PTSD.,3
"All those delhi fans saying mumbai's bowling is shit after one bad match, where are you now huh",1
Delhi's is playing like when you go for the 6th gear after reaching the 5th gear but the 6th gear is the reverse gear.,5
Warner gonna get 138,1
YJB who?,3
Holy fuck just tuned in to see kagiso rabada getting absolutely eviscerated,2
What's the highest pp score ever?,2
Birthday bash by Warner boiii,3
Deshpande to hit his maiden 100 today,4
I feel sick.,2
Anyone calling a wicket after timeout gentlemen?,2
MI and RCB...you face SRH next.,5
Imagine what they're gonna do to Tushar Deshpande.,4
2016 SRH all over again. Come on boisssssss,6
If SRH don't get 200 from here then they can fuck off.,3
perfect time for Deshpande,0
"If RCB and MI aren't quaking in their boots right now, they are out of their mind.",2
This is a good start and all but can't help but feel Saha just isn't oddly proportioned enough to fill in for YJB as the rarest of units,2
"if we lose here, which it looks like it's gonna happen, we almost certainly are dropping to Mumbai and Bangalore. We out of the playoffs then?",-1
It’s like we realised we want to be back home well in time before Diwali.,4
Why isnt Bairstow playing?,4
This carnage reminds me DD vs DC 2009 playoff and gilly alone taking the game away from the table toppers.,2
"usually Iyyer tries to sneak in 4 deshpandey/stoinis overs, what the fuck are we going to do when the entire team bowls like deshpandeys",6
I'll say this once and disappear. **This batting is diabolical**,4
BC ye kya ho gaya 😑,4
Was Saha an opener for KXIP 2014?,0
Saha seems more stable than Pant in his batting. Not saying he’s better necessarily.,-1
"Now When we will come to batting, suddenly the ball will stat moving and we'll make 35/2. This is just unfair. I don't wanna play.",7
Wonder where this freedom went with Warner in the first half of the season. His timing was bad and looked so passive but now this is vintage Warner.,5
warner trying not to get out cuz he knows if he leaves it to the middle order they will lose yet again,7
"Saha should take Pant's gloves and say: ""Yeh main kar leta hoon, aap jaake Dream11 ki team banaiye""",14

"I kept on saying.. drop Rabada and play Harshal Patel instead.


But they don't listen to me. Rabada is useless.",-11
Warners form proudly brought to you by choke against KXIP,0
I want a Warneresque opener for India T20I. Is that too much to ask :(,4
Well I guess I need to forget that my team is being hit all over the place and enjoy the batting.,2
DC peaked a bit too early,3
Beauty of IPL is how balanced all teams are becuase of Money Purse being equal. 8 Teams aren't equal in International cricket but here they are. Even CSK if they can buy Malan or Labuschange and release Watson. They'll be equal too.,6
Noo dc!! You are the only north Indian team who has a chance to be qualified:(,-4
Prefect time for for Deshpande to get tonked,1
AB MARENGE DONO,3
If SRH scores 180+ I want Pant to open the batting today and go beserk.. DC have forgotten he is the original destroyer and not a fuckn accumulator..,7

That dive showed more intent of staying alive than the entirety of CSK this year.    /s,17

You can rely on South Africans to fail you at crunch moments.,7
Saha is gonna sweep his way to a fifty,9
SRH are a DC-track bully.,4

Bairstow sweating,4
I predict DC come to bat and lose 3 wickets in powerplay and then choke on Rashid.,4
This is how you play a do-or-die match,4
Tomorrow im scared of MI absolutely destroying us. Dont want to lose by 100+ runs again,5
"Damn, these boys batting like they on PCP.",6

What happened to the best bowling side DC?,1
Are we going to see 250 today?,1
We're making saha look like pant ffs,1
Saha looks pretty fit for a 36 yr old. Definitely much fitter than “over weight” Pant,5
Every boundary and quick runs Saha produces now is a big bonus.,2
I think warner has won orange cap in 3 of the last 5 seasons and ig he was banned for one season and in 2016 he was below kohli who wasn't human in that season ... That is srsly exceptional,7

"Wait wtf lmao how did Warner jump up to 3rd on orange cap?? I thought he was far down. But damn, I'm happy",5
Saha is 36 from 19 balls. I don't care who you are you love this.,10
"*These two comments from ESPNcricinfo*:

Looking at the all-time runs charts for the IPL, it's scary to see consistent Warner has been. He's scored 50 scores of 50 or more in about 130 innings; nobody is even close

This version of Warner rivals Gayle as the best overseas batsman ever in the IPL not the poke around for 14 overs version of Warner

*I think sheer consistency makes Warner > Gayle*",8
“delhi slightly off it at the moment” *slightly* is an understatement,6
"Anyone feels pant is unnecessarly hyped ?



Sky, samson ,Mayank etc there are way better batsman than him (fitter too)",6

I like how top teams suddenly start playing like headless chickens and the bottom teams play like the second coming of Australia 2007.,7
As a lifelong Jonny Bairstow supporter today is a sad day,3
Delhi won against Chennai also due to their village level fielding and 5 Dhawan drops,5
If Warner and Kohli bat together they wouldn't even need to score boundaries. Can easily run 2-3 every ball.,7
"The move last time with Samad at 3 was the right attacking move just didn’t come off but he attacked the best bowler. If one gets out, I think they should still use him to attack from the first ball",2
Lord Tushar comes into the attack.,1
Koach needs to up his strike rate.,1
Yeh kya chutiyapa ho raha hai,2
Friendship ended with Warner-Bairstow. Warner-Saha is my new best frand.,9
SRH probably saw how DC just cowered when under the pump in the last couple match s and proceeded to pump it up and here DC deflate,2
Maybe we should take Saha into the t20 side too since the selectors and captain seem to only look at the last 2 performances of people.,6
Trevor looks wholesome,2
Saha is a gun behind the wickets too. More excited for that more than anything,5
We all thought Warner was having a bad season and he has sneaked onto 3rd in most run scorers in no time.,6
Is pant trying sledge warner?,0

Delhi really lack intensity from their captain. This doesn't happen under a Warner or Kohli.,2
Saha has already repaid his selection to SRH in kind. Nobody expected him to score even 30 that too at a strike rate of over 120,4
They don’t even need to hit Deshpande. It’s been so bad lol.,7
100 in 9 overs.... wow!,4

It's fun to watch matches being completely neutral. Not rooting for any side feels good. Especially in a match where Warner seems to be back in his madlad mode (treated Rabada as an ordinary bowler).,0

u/RLKay has Warner’s innings today changed your opinion from before? About his performance. Just a little at least.,6
At this point should we just make a new sub for apology threads?,6
What's the par score at dubai? 160s?,3
Saha sweeping the last remaining bits and pieces of Pant's test career 🙂,6
Safe to say Saha is the best wicketkeeper to play for India in our home season?,2
167/9 coming up in a bit,3
200 is on if Saha stays on for another 3-4 overs,5
Imo if you’re going to play pandey at 3 you should be playing bairstow at 4 instead of Kane.,7
are fielders sitting in the dugout?? where the fuck are they??,1
People dissing on Manish already. I have a feeling he will do well today. Does his best work when not under pressure,10

Place a fielder there you cucks,9
Challenge for Pandey to not bring the RR down.,5

Holy shit. I won’t be surprised if r/cricket starts calling for Saha’s inclusion into the Indian LOI team ahead of Pant and Samson now. Lol,2
"Saha has done well, today. Congrats on the 50 my dude",3
How old is Saha?,2
Well played Saha. The management sent him to strike from ball one but he is not playing any rash shots. All class,1
Pandey 100 SR. It can only go downhill from here.,1
"I think RCB should learn something from this approach!

Come on Koach you player better than this in ODI :(",9
For those of you saying Kane at 3 don’t realize how trash Pandey is at 4. Pandeys numbers significantly improve when he plays at 3. Kane can play as anchor at 4,4
Saha should be termed illegal.,1
Oo bhai Saha mein kiski mata aa gayi,1
What new virus will agent Bairstow unleash now that a new keeper has taken his spot?,11
ethical mind trying to stop the boundary with his mind lol,4
"SRH in their last match - 114 all out in 19.5 overs

SRH in this match - 122/1 in 10.3 overs",28
How is Saha such a tailender in tests? Looks so good here.,6
Where are my “DC will play final “ homies?,1
At least with Warner gone Rabada would be a bit more economical,3
Won't be surprised to see Pant making twice duck in Adelaide Day night Test and we see Saha playing in boxing day test 😂😭😂😭,9
"Saha seems to be in Faizal Khan mode...""Sabka account kholege tera Faizal, Rabada ka, Nokia ka, Ashwin ka, Deshpande ka...""",17
Srh probably chasing last match 127 along with this lol,42
Cricket is such a confidence game. Warner decided to wake up on the other side of bed and came with positive intent. What a start. And Saha is looking like Sahoo,10
Srh is dangerous because it has nothing to loose.,5
[deleted],12
Did Anju Chopra really just call Manish Pandey “The Big Striker”. Terrible commentator,6
I never thought Saha was LOI/T20 batsman. Why does India play him only in tests?,6
I find it weirdly satisfactory when a player scores at 170-180 strike rate without any sixes,10
Such a great score yet there are barely any sixes.,9
If only we had Sanga in the dugout instead of Bangar.,4
Would love to see Saha in the Aussie series🔥,1
Pandey you're from my school so no hate but pls no tuk tuk today,3
"Atleast he's not started off with his back to the wall, good to see",4

Anyone ready with the apology thread for Saha?,9
[deleted],1
"restricting till 200 is now an achievement, and in the second innings I'm sure we'll somehow struggle on 8 rpo in powerplay and fuck up our chase somehow",6
Is it just me or that's some slobby ass fielding from DC?,7
Pandey has been on the scene for way too long and played way too many games to have scored just 3000+ runs till now.,4
Best thing about Saha today is his aggression against the spin. Even the best batsman in this IPL have played off spinners and covered for it in last 5 overs by smashing the pacers.,11
Pandey ji - Delhi's only hope,2
Here before Pandey's strike rate drops below 300,8
What warrants Pandey consistently coming above Williamson,6
Have they tried not bowling shit?,9
This umpire is sucha cutie.,4
14 run over,2
So good to see Saha doing well.,2
Deshpande's back baby,7
Pandey SR watch : 200,7
Delhi gonna bottle this lol,10
How did this team choke while chasing 127!?!?!,18
DC: Ye kya plan hai?,4
What are you guys talking about? Pandey has a strike rate of 200 atm,2
250 will be a par score,5
Which team is batting? I have never seen these guys in this tournament before.,22
Inb4 Iyer talks about how Rabada let the team down today,33
This is just the perfect setup for Pant to unleash HELL,3
263 sweating profusely,9
This SRH lineup looks stronger than the one they have been playing all along. Add bhuvi to it and you get a champion side. I am not saying this just because they are batting well in this game.,10
Rishab Eazy Pant,9
"FYI PredictViz now puts SRH final as

 *215* runs 

after 20 overs.",4
Fuck Beauty,1
"Pandey isnt thinking of tuk tuk either, niiicee",6
Saha really deserves 100 given the way he’s playing,3
DC’s 2020 IPL performance has been getting bad match by match.,1
"Good to see Deshpande being backed, being thrashed like that by Gayle would break even the best in the business's confidence",4
"If SRH had faced RCB/MI instead of DC in this match, I don't think score would have been much different.",7

"When you sweep, do it like  saha not johny",1

Saha should have been our no. 4 /s,1
"We will have to Chase 200

Dhawan getting out sweeping

Iyer 39 off 30

Pant hoicks one to cow corner vs Rashid

Hetty has too much to do",0
HAHAHAH ashwin diving and the ball stopping before him lmao,8
Attacking spinners is the best way to play them.,3
i dont wanna jinx it - but 100(55)!?,2
Iyer lookin clueless like Kohli hahaha,3
Hahahaha ashwin,5
Imagine SRH breaking RCB's record of 263 today.,3
Yo ashwin wtf,6
DC should open with and unleash Pant. He's useless in middle order holding the wickets role.,5
Ashwin after he starts sliding: _now what?_,13
Wtf was Ashwin doing there,6

Ethical fielding™,6
Ethical dive by Ashwin,8
🤣 Ashwin what a dive!!,3
Ashwin with the dive lol,3
i want to have what Saha had before the match,6
Kind kind of fielding/sliding was that from Ashwin??!!!,8
It's like he has a map of the ground dimensions and field settings imprinted in his mind. At the moment it looks like there are no fielders on the ground for Saha,3
Ash wtf are you doing mate,5
So many 3s and 4s,2
"RCB be like 127-1 even in 16 overs 

We are fine enough score :)",2
Haha ashwin sitting down and waiting for ball to arrive 😂🤣,5
"If Pandey can go from basically ball 1, so can Iyer. These are exactly the kinds of chases that anchors lose for your team with their 40(30) so it will be interesting to see how aggressively he plays when he comes out to bat.",3
Ashwin making sure we don't miss his teammate Mishraji's ground fielding.,8
Did he just field with his ass?,7
Lol Ashwin,6
Ashwin stopped the whole outfield instead of the ball.,4
"I can't believe Saha is playing his first IPL this year?

SRH must be wondering what if they had played him earlier.",3
Kanos hasn't even come to bat yet.,1
That slide was why Ashwin isn’t on the t20 team lmao,3
Ethical Mind enjoying some sunbath under the ring of fire,3
Ashwins fielding in slow motion lol,4
I hope SRH didnt bring Saha out a game too late,1
Ashwin looked like he just sat down and wanted a chai and vadai.,6
"Lol! Ashwin is like -  Nowhere to go BALL, you stop here!",6
"Eng Broadcast Sky Cricket Pre show : "" Why is Bairstow not playing? This is bizzare, he's better than Saha isn't he?""




Saha : "" Hold me sweep shots bitches""",11
Man Saha has been so nonchalant for his runs.,2
"I'm just enjoying this batting master class at this point, we're gonna lose but so be it",5
Mark my words... Saha will not make any runs after this. We are really good at making such batsmen greater than they really are.,3
Wriddhiman Saha has derailed the Pant hype train in 30 minutes with this Intent™.,4
Wow how good was that,3
Wriddhiman Bairstow,4
Petition to make every game day Warner's birthday.,3
"finally

a good fucking match",1
What a fucking bliss this innings,0
Saha should stay till the end.,2
How fucking good has Saha looked. Even better than Warner now.,6
saha batting : shift+D.,5
What the fuck is this field setting? Are you kidding me?,3
Saha looks in the zone right now.,2
"I don't know if Shreyas is clueless or calm. 

His body language 🤷",7
Damn if they double their score after 12th over they'd destroy the highest score of all time.,2
Fearless Saha shit man,6
"Seeing this, I feel like Saha should be more upset than Pant on missing India's white ball squad for Australia.",4
HOW IS EVERY SHOT GOING TO BOUNDARY SO EASILY,13
Holy shit what a classy shot selection from Saha,6
"Just checked in. Is this my SRH

Rubbing my eyes",11
fade me,4
this seems the first match in a while that any team has just gone ham with the bat.,2
Didn't know he is 36.,5
Kya ho rha hai bc,3
"Saha showing all wickets. Wanna take wickets , take wickets",3
Dc is getting thrashed and we haven't got to see punters face yet ? Unacceptable,8
"Bruhhh, what’s DC’s fielding tonight?",7
"How tf he's finding gaps so easily, seems like DC fielding with 6-7 fielders only",8
Saha is just finding gaps in the field like a pro.,3
Village fielding X 3,3
He's channeled his IPL final innings today,3
majestic 👼🏻,2
Assuming Bairstow won't be playing any other matches this season,5
"Why Ashwin always constipated lol, he needs to enjoy more.",3
Go go go.....,1
"SRH and injuries, name a more iconic duo",6
what the actual fuck is this field placing? it's like we're fielding with 5 guys in total.,3
Saha's placement has been Godly.,2
I am speechless at how fluently Saha is playing all these shots today.,8
Why do I cringe everytime Sanjay Bangar speaks,0
Ok Saha has been brilliant,0
Saha already injured?,1
Is this pitch really good for batting?,3
Saha's placement is fucking insane,10
Saha's timing in this innings >>>>>,11
This isn’t the SRH I know playing tonight,4
Saha is in golden touch today. He is touching the ball and it is going to boundary,7
"God-Damn, look at those ground shots into the gaps ahhhhhhh",9
You know the field set is shit when they have already ran 3 runs 3 times already,3
So where was this SRH all along?????,5
"Indian team selectors after Saha's innings:

*Emergency Meeting",11
Wow... Great job keeping the momentum... I was not expecting run rate to keep steady beyond 6 overs,1
Bowl to the fuckinh field you idiots,3
Oooo.... What happened.... Hopefully nothing serious.,1
"Running 3s when some wouldn't even go for the 2, love that energy",6
Saha and injuries. Name a better duo,1
Saha despite being a decade older seems so much more fitter than pant. Kinda embarassing for pant tbh,3
Oh please don't be injured. We have no backup WK,2
Saha is on fire! Finding gaps like prime Tendulkar.,3
Okay this pitch ain't slowing down. DC has a chance.,3
I see no fielders on the ground at the moment. Just some swimmers testing the dew,8
141 in 12 overs. Am I dreaming??,4
This innings reminds me of his century in 2014 final,4
I'll have what Saha is having...,9
Ok now this is too much saha,2
Saha can't play no more safety first,4
"DC's lack of wristspinner costing them 
 
Sandeep may play the next match",0
so in T20 you should double your score at over 12 yeah? SRH to make 280 this match?,7
How has Ponting not eaten one of these folks alive  yet?,2
SAHA IS 36 YEARS OLD???,17
Just checking in... what happened here? Are delhi not playing with any bowling?,5
Saha needs to keep too. Hope he departs quick if he isn't that fit ATM.,3
"r/Cricket - 

initiating apology sequence ...

Replace batsman “XYZ” with “Saha”
Rerun program",26
"When Dhoni gave the same pose, everyone was like 'Bahubali' Thala!

Let's see how they react after seeing Saha!",19
Do well then get injured? Summarizes the season for us.,11
Enough runs already on board. And still 8 more overs to go. FML,3
"DC bowling getting destroyed by Nitish Rana, Sunil Narine and now Saha, I did not see that coming.",4
Someone get started on the Saha apology thred now.,6
Saha:- only scores in big games,10
"Indian team selectors after Saha's innings:

*Emergency Meeting",28
That's nazar yo!,0
"Axar destroyed.

Who is left now??",0
saha almost single-handedly destroying the econs of the dc bowlers,9
Noooo Saha please be okay,8
Wow SRH is past its normal 2nd innings score and there's still about 9 overs left.,8
And that’s a 15 run over,5
They say you are supposed to double the score at 12 overs. So 280 it is.,21
Imagine Saha now goes into another gear because he can't run.,21
"Looks like Ashwin has taken his KXIP experience to DC - win 4 to 5 matches in the beginning, get cunted to hell after",2
Bring Lara the lucky charm in dugout asap,2
IPL 2014 Final heroes batting together,63
DC to do reverse KXIP,8
This is what I expected from Trevor Baylis’s team.,11
[deleted],13
Saha is an excellent player of spin. Bairstow struggled and struggled and struggled. This is why I felt we should have been more open to Saha and Sreevats. Saha has a good strike rate in powerplay and can regulate the middle overs.,9
Gayle broke DC that day,26
If saha can transition from tests to t20 then why can't rahane,21
guessing pandey is there for moral support,10
The same team choked last match by losing 7 wickets in 14 runs.,22
Ponting finna pull out that spring bat from 2003,9
I mean these 2 now can literally go at every ball considering just 1 wicket is lost amd Williamson is yet to come.,8
Where are you Saha haters,2
"Question: if you WK goes unfit through half time, can you get a substitute WK like you do with fielders?",2
Delhi is missing someone like Harshal Patel who can bowl lot of variations.,2
"Oh no, Rabada is about to get rocked",2
hooolllyy crap saha rolling back the years this is absolutely sparkling batting diwali came early,5
Saha be playing like Cricket 07...,27
DC. Hey hey hey. Goodbye.,6
Pant should be the most worried now,7
In before apology thread for Saha,13
rabada 37 runs conceded I can’t believe my eyes,8
My catch: David and saha were too scared of pandey playing and a 50 s/r ..... /s,5
Seriously missing mishraji today. He comes good under pressure while ashwin crumbles.,5
This is gonna fuck up our NRR so much that if we won't even make it on NRR anymore. Delhi batsmen can't chase this. They panic too quickly.,4
Rabada going at 20 RR is unreal.,5
Wooo rabada 2 over 37.  Who cunted him?,7
rabada's 50 today?,5
Sanjay Bangar is no good than Kapil dev here. Says every generic thing possible,3
Hopefully we can beat RCB cuz we sure as hell ain’t going top 2 without that,3
Wickets incoming,0
Looks like Ponting played all his aces in 1st half of the tournament.,5
Is thampi worst than khaleel ?,3
I have a gut feeling Rashid is gonna get cunted today,3
Can we just get 50 all out now so that the more deserving teams can make the playoff and I can skip the last 2 games? Thanks!,3
Wait WTF? Rabada went for 37 in 2?!,17
Rabada redemption over?,0
Why is SRH even doing this. They aren't going to make it anyways. Baksh do yaaro,-3
"Saha pls don't play too well, CSK already calling your phone",7
Excited to see what kind of batting DC is gonna pull off.,8
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",3
Possible 250?,13
"Honestly, it's therapeutic to see DC bowlers getting smashed around",28
SRH 114 allout in 19.5 last match. Today 113/1 in 10.0,30
Rabada and Nortje are good in death overs. Should be able to restrict them under 200.,2
Can Rabada top Saini's 3 over 48? Lessfindout,8
To top it off this is the match where we needed Shaw's explosive opening and we got Rahane :(,7
Khaleel creepy af,12
Jonny BairSaha,11
"Pant really having a bad week 
 
Now saha scoring runs may even cost him his test spot",7

"Wicket tegiro nimmoun!  
  
T: Please sire, pick a wicket soon.",4
How to hit in the air and not get caught by Saha,2
Still don't understand the choice to send out Pandey. Wouldn't Pandey be a better finisher than Williamson?,2
Hope Saha gets a century to put the nail in our coffin,6
Not a single bouncer or yorker from Rabada so far. His brain stopped working completely,5
Binga doesn’t seem like himself which is understandable but sad 😞,1
Saha has to keep wickets. He better retire and take rest now.,2
Umpire looks badass,1
Pant is 23 and Saha is 36. I bet Pant would have rejected half of the running that Saha did today.,9
[removed],20
I predicted 152/1 in 13,1
Where are the fielders????,3
Send Rashid in next you cowards.,3
What’s the average on this pitch?,2
Even his shoulder hits a four.,3
Which stadium is this one??,5
Sanjay Bangar will fit right into r/increasinglyverbose,8
Rabada to  go wicketless today?,4
Please send samad in next.,4
Benchod doesn't even require a bat anymore.,9
Our spinners don’t turn the ball. We saw how Varun ripped us a new one last match. I expect nothing less from Rashid.,2
God mode activated,4
"what does that mean, why would Saha pick his ""bat up in anger""?",4
Pandey SR watch: 150,3
Can Rabada top Rajpoot's 4 over 60 runs tho?,7
Just tuned in AND WHAT THE FUCK SAHA,7
FOUR LEG BYES WTF,4

Beautiful shot,1
SRH got offended when people started saying DC has the best bowling side,8
Saha has decided to give his mind and body for this match,4
[deleted],1
Rabada who??,4
That sound off the bat was so sexy.,2
Have DC bowlers completely forgotten how to bowl Yorkers and slow balls.. what with this short pitch bowling..,2

Lmao Saha who hurt you,4
Saha >>> AB using even his shoulders to hit 4s,6
Holy guacamole! What a shot,3
Why is there no deep mid wicket? Wtf Iyer,2
Fuck me... DC were looking invincible 3 games ago...,7
Ajinkya Rahane dreams that he can bat like Saha one day!,11
what a sexxyyyy shot,7
That's a six ffs,6
Iyer usually had the luxury of saving up 2-3 Rabada overs for the death. This counter attack has forced him to use Rabada up top. This is a blueprint for other teams to try and get DC now.,9
That sound. That damn sound it made.,7
DC lost the top team momentum,5
SAHA MY DUDE,7
Can we have second innings in Sharjah?,10
Maro Altroz ko. Maro.,6

Serious big dick batting by Saha.,12

Saha better be giving plenty of 'yes Rash, nice Rash' behind the stumps to make up for him",13
Rabada's second half century this season.,5
Common Pandey. Play like you played against RR,6
Delhi is chasing 240ish i believe.,6
Why is Delhi choking in this stage of the tournament? Are they really gonna let Saha score a century here?,5
This is rather one sided. Delhi isn't winning this.,7
Kag going for 47 in 3 is so shocking to me,10
Imagine getting molested by a fragile old test specialist,3
20 off Stoins at least please,2
Feels like Pandey has been out there for so long but has only faced 5 balls.,10
DC remaining games are against RCB and Mumbai. Could very well end up missing the top 4 at this rate lmao,8

Aah Marcus Stoinis. The Marquee bowler,3

Love how the teams at the bottom of the table are playing now....MI RCB and DC have their work cut out for them,9
Saha looks tired,7
3 of 3 great bowling,3
The man has a 100 in IPL finals iirc,7

It looks like Delhi has only like five fielders.. not sure if it's iyers field placement or not bowling to the plan or just Saha picking the gaps,3
Tbf stoinis would bowl well in this pitch,1
"Slower balls working on the pitch, DC batting gonna get fucked",1
Damn Rabada was spanked today huh,1

Wtf is Pandey doing! Anchoring to the end when the non striker is clearly tired.. Idiocy at its peak!,4
This is how you DC used to play with their power packed lineup in past years. DC fans must be nostalgic seeing this.,3

36 YEARS GOLD. ⬆️🔥🙏,4
No one can stop Saha today,4
*We will bowl first* - Famous last words,12
Saha slowly morphing into peak Gilchrist,6
"Hello friends I am new to cricket 

Is this man on strike the so called Don Bradman ?",9
DC doing same mistake as RCB against CSK,8
"Pant fans made excuses saying "" Pant is short in height that's why he looks fat and unfit"" they should look at Saha mind you he's celebrating Durgo Puja and eating those Rosogolla more than ever ❤️",11
*Sad Rishabh Pant noises*,6
Gonna beat my meat To Saha's hotstar of the match video,6
Rudimentary Saha inching closer to one o o .,3
"9 wickets in hand. 6 overs left. Williamson in the shed. 

Pandey needs to go. Can't be playing anchor here.",9
"I mean sure it’s amazing batting by Warner and Saha,but is it the pitch that’s not providing any assistance for the bowlers or is it poor bowling and captaincy?",10
Saha toying with the field here,8
9 runs an over is a good over for DC today.,15
Pick Saha in the Indian T20 squad for Australia.,6
Lol how many runs have we scored behind the wicket ?,5
These 2 who carried their teams in the 2014 finals are now batting together,10
"6 bowlers used so far.


Next over ab Pant se dalwayenge ye log.",9
Wridhiman 'once in 6 years will play a destructive Innings' Saha,10
Even a slow over went for 9 lmao,6
Do the Capitals know that there's no Khaleel today?,6
"So we lost to a struggling kxip, lost to a struggling kkr and are now getting dicked by a struggling srh.

Even if we make the playoffs we are so fucking screwed. Gonna be at most 3rd place like it was last year.",6
Bairstow must be like WTF,9
Next DC matches against MI and RCB??,4
They have enough already lol.,7
Can Saha get to a century ?,7
Not the SRH I know,8
Considering Saha's stars Rashid will hit 3 sixes in last over and take all the limelight,8
"Rabada ""I am purple cap holder by a big margin""

Warner ""Idgaf""",9
You need to ask why wasn't he selected for LOI squad. Best wicketkeeper batsmen in India at present - Upcoming tweet from GG.,8
Someone needs to do a ABD for srh,7
"Bring yourself on Iyer, you coward.",8
Rabada might lose that wicket streak today but it might be good to humble him down a bit,4
DC doing punjab in reverse.,10
Anybody else think Delhi Capitals are fielding like shit today ?,5
Just joining in. What the fuck happened here?,6
Supreme leader David Warner knew that the tournament would be one sided if Saha played all the games. He wanted to spread joy during tough times. Fairplay award +9000 please.,38
Pant face - Now I am in danger,6
Fixed /s,0
"Saha:Call an ambulance

Also Saha:But not for me",7
"
BOWLERS	                O	M	R	W	ECON

Kagiso Rabada (rf)	3	0	47	0	15.66	


Now that is something you do not see often. Those are Vinay kumar level stats.",5
Saha throwin me back to that golden IPL final hundy he cunted.. man delivers against all odds,5
"Before this innings everyone was shitting on Saha now that he is playing a very good knock, omg get him in the team so much greater than pant.",8
Rabada 0-47 in 3 overs? LMAO what?,10
"Law of averages went HARD on Rabada today, jokes on you, he's gonna take a fifer in playoffs",3
What must be going through the mind of Bairstow?,2
"If Shankar gets to bat today , they won't get to 220+",8
Is Lara on dugout rn?,3
Well that feeling of utter hopelessness was long due,4
Pandey SR watch: 137,2
Pandey has to start hitting some boundaries so Saha doesn't feel weighed down,4
Iyer to have a bowl next.,3
Flash news - Saha added in India t20 squad as backup keeper,3
T20 Pandey  is fuckin up run rate set by our test WK!!!,5
Saha jist doesn't want to stop tonight.,3
what a shot,2
Iyer- Baat toh Saha hai,4
This is just beautiful.,2
Then : Naraine  Now : Saha,0
This is just great batting period,2
"What a fucking shot, geez...",5
"Pandey: scoring at an ok strike rate, giving strike to the set batsman who's smashing everything

This thread: wtf is this chutiya doing",10
fielders.exe not found,3
Saha ahaaaaa!,2
"Lol 7th place currently battering 2nd place. 

Points table goes brrrrrrrrr",4
"Holy shit just seen those bowling figures for the first time

Rabada got taken to the cleaners, wtf is going on",3
"Chad Saha returning with a 100
You can't write the script...

**Edit**: Whoops! I ruined it. One too many shots...Delhi fans may thank me.",3
Holy shit the shot selection and placement. This is classy as fuck,1
"People talk about how poorly Pant is being handled by india, but what improvement has he shown towards his keeping and batting, he is still young,  why rush to make him happen as a set player in all formats.",5
Saha only scoring boundaries,2
Saha my man finding those gaps. Love that,3
Do people really not realise teams and players can have off days. This has to be the most knee jerky thread ever.,6
Where are the fucking fielders??,2
Where are the fielders lmaooo,3
Looks like Rabada finally gonna go wicket less.,1
170 already. 😳,2
Bad captaincy or is he picking the gaps well.,2
Last time i saw saha playing like this was in 2014 i guess.,1
155 kph smashed over extra cover.,2
Good god,3
Saha toying the bowlers,2
Iyer now have a back to back we will have a bowl first matches.,5
Fuck Pandey,1
Gg saha,5
Fuck fuck fuck,3
Damn feel for him,5
Noooooo at 87 goddammit,3
210?,2
"SAHA NO

MISSED OUT ON A DESERVED TON",7
Yes GET THAT WICKET FUCK YEAH,-1
Noooooooo Saha out :(,5
Well played Saha. Was very entertaining,3
Aw mann...deserved century....either way Well played,6
Okay this is epic 😳,1
So Williamson was my Captain and didn't have Saha in the fantasy team,4
Well fucking played Saha my boy,3
Ah shit. Deserved a hundred there. Amazing innings.,7
The placing is so good you think a couple of DC fielders have been sent off,6
Oh noo. Please don't struggle to get to 200 now.,4
"Great knock from Saha

Deserved 100 tbh",5
Saha is beautiful to watch today,2
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. he deserved a ton here,6
This was Saha of 2014 batting,7
"This is just hilarious shit

Absolutely no one would have predicted this .",6
Saha goddamn bro chill,2
Damn u nokia,2
RIP,2
"OOooo Daddyy Saha, good innings",3
Finally...,2
Dammit bruh you deserved a 100,7
What an innings.. kudos Saha 👏,1
"Wait after this over both Nortje and Rabada will have only 1 over left, 270 on the cards.",3
"Seriously, Saha ball placement is nothing short of spectacular.",9
Nothing going pant's way tonight. Perfectly setup for him to score a match winning ton,2
Noooooooo,5
Awww Saha :(,3
Calmest rampage I have ever seen.,29
_Feels sad man_,3
Excellent innings from Saha. Unselfish from him to not just knock it around for his century.,19
Great knock by Saha,1
Well played saha,1
I hope the Indian selectors are watching this splendid knock by Saha. He should definitely be considered for limited overs side too,7
fml,1
Nooo you deserved that 100 Saha,6
Nooo wridhiii,3
If SRH keep showing such dominant display of cricket then they should definitely Butta Bomma their way to the playoffs,10
"Saha deserved that Century, played extremely well",11
Well done Saha. Hope you can rest and be fit to keep.,5
Noooo,1
MARK NICHOLAS YOU CURSEYMOUTH 😡,11
"Bangar's favourite words in the dugout -

Rollicking,
Disdain,
Tonking,
Literally",7
Finally.,3
"What an innings from Saha, unfortunately couldn't get 💯",11
Selfless Saha,7
Fans would be having an orgasm had their beloved thala played an innings like Saha today,7
Brilliant innings Saha,2
but then here comes Kane fucking Williamson lmao. we are screwed,4
Rashid in. Rashid in. Rashid in.,7
Really deserved his 100. Poor guy,4
"Oh fuck off, that was the second ball I watched.",13
Please Kanos hit them hard,3
I started my stream and Saha out lol.,3
"Is this Shaha's first game this season?

Edit : Saha",8
A dictionary example of commentary curse.,6
Sahaaaaaa!!!!! Why sooo selfless! Mate you deserved this 100 :(,5
Saahore SAHA ....,2
 How must srh be feeling now making this guy sit for all this time,10
"He deserved that hundred! But, too selfless to slow down to make sure he gets there!",35
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ...NOOOOOOOOOOO,6
r/Cricket and jinxing...,4
Now watch middle order score 20 runs in the 5 overs left,4
The test specialist has played a better T20 innings than the so-called T20 experts.,11
Rabada joins Dinda academy as an exchange student,19
"Ok, Saha for #4",5
"Im gonna say it, Pandey got Saha out",4
Well played Saha ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪,7
U people are responsible for jinxing it,9
Well played Saha,3
Great knock,3
Kanos time 🥰,4
williamson gets out and then tailenders come in...,1
"Moral victory for Delhi if 200 is restricted, doubt it will happen though",3
Will SRH get to 220?,2
"Ah shit, the best looking knock this ipl, shame he missed out on the daddy 100",8
Inb4 Pandey drags them to 190 ^pls ^no,6
Now watch us end at 190/8,9
"Fuck man, I wanted SAHA century",8
Saha really deserved a ton here,5
Cmon dc limit them to under 200 and we got a chance,3
They prepared for YJB and Warner but Saha came out  of sylabbus,21
What an innings. So refreshing to watch. Gg saha,12
"SRH will get 200 even if they score at 6 runs per over from now. Wow, just wow!",12
So many batsmen would have slowed down to ensure their century. Respect.,60
"Excellent innings, some absolute beautiful shots played",3
Thanks commentator -_-,5
What an innings. Massive respect to the 36 year gold 🙏,8
Manish pandey should have taken charge i think. Saha was pretty much out of energy and support from the other end might have helped him recover,8
"**14.3** Nortje to Saha, OUT,  **170-2**

WP Saha c Iyer b Nortje 87 (45b 12x4 2x6) SR: 193.33",2
nokia > kg this ipl imo,6
Saha to Johnny: *I am going to end this man's whole IPL career*,7
Only hope for dc is a test innings by manish pandey,5
Will be disappointing if they dont score 220 now.,4
Please Bangar why are you faking your commentary style? Speak normally what's wrong with that,4
Aight plz be Kane bullet train and not Kane coal locomotive,7
"SRH are free to play ruthless cricket now though. They already have a decent total on the board, and have 8 wickets in hand. They should aim for 230+ tbh. Nortje and Rabada also only have 2 overs left",4
Now SRH fans will talk about how it is impossible to reach 180.,7
Don't see bairstow coming back after this,8
"We all know Rabada's just a budget Vijay Shankar

Not everyone can bowl as well as Lord 3D",14
Incoming apology thread for Saha,10
"R Pant can't catch a break 😂
Now Saha starts performing",10
"Who should come in next? Kanos, Samad or Holder?",6
Well played Saha...absolute destruction,6
Such a cracker inning... Rooting for DC but still wanted to see him hit triple digit,8
Saha beast mode,3
"On the brig side, we get to see kaney bat",6
"We will get in the 160s, don’t worry",2
Lord Shankar will take revenge of Saha's 100 now.,6
"Yes Absolut we know you sell ""Music CDs"" in 2020.",7
This is my favourite inning of this IPL so far!!!,14
Saha needs to share some of his mom's biryani with DC,8
Man SRH need a lower order finisher. Someone like ummmm Yusuf Pathan?,6
[removed],7
BC Dubai ko Sharjah bana diya,7
"Mark Nicholas with that brutal commentator's curse, unlucky Saha, well played.",13
Kanos time,6
"""Much like Warner, Saha doesn't have much power""


Lmfao, ask Joe Root please.",9
Saha and unexpected knocks in a must win situation game... Great love story...,7
And there goes the last nail in bairstow's coffin,3
Man.. What a selfless innings...came and screwed everyone and went on his merry way without thinking of his 100,12
I respect this more than a 100 that’s was achieved through singles,4
Dinesh Kartik and pant watching pant in awe.,4
DC bowlers doing same mistakes as RCB bowlers. Offering pace and feeding short or slot deliveries,5
DC doing a reverse KXIP,6
Could have gone for his 100 & no one would have said anything but he still showed intent.,4
"How good a human you have to be to not show anger at all, and also not play for his personal milestone",8
"Man, Manish Pandey really didn't contribute shit. He was an awful partner to Saha.",2
What an innings. Subho bijoya indeed.,3
"Luckily we still have stupid sexy Kanos and 3D Shankar but the again......




.......17-7",3
33 balls to go. If they don't get 220 its a big letdown from the middle order,8
This saha innings reminds me of dravid-rahane partnerships for rr. They were a bliss to watch. No shit innovation. Just pure cricketing shots.,6
Speak about a commentator curse lmaoo,4
That was an incredible knock from Saha. This is more than an apology-thread type of innings because we haven't even been trolling him but were being dismissive.,7
That innings has to be the best non-bruteforce T20 innings in recent times.,26
"So the best innings this season from an Indian keeper not called Rahul wasn't from Dhoni, Samson, Karthik or Pant.

Can't wait for Parthiv to smash a 100 the next match.",22
Too selfless.,9
Lmao Scott Styris just compared Saha to Steve Smith the look on Brett Lee face 😭😂😭😂😭,5
Jonny Baristow looks like a funner Ron Weasley,8
"I'm rooting for DC slightly cause of KG and Nortje but I swear after such a fantastic start if the SRH middle order don't finish this well and screw it up, I'm gonna lose my shit.",8
Why would saha be angry?,5
"Okay enough of being negative, we got this!",5
watch us struggle to get 171 now,11
Bowlers to Saha: thodi maryada rakhiye,8
If only SRH (and RR) had shown this level of play when they did not need to win every game and need other results to go in their favor,5
If Kane doesnt hit a 10 ball half century im gonna be very angry,26
"They should get to atleast 230, atleast",1
A gentle reminder that SRH have their next two matches at Sharjah.,12
"Would be really dope to see Kanos in CSK.

Perfect for captaincy and his style suits CSK more.",12
"Remember when Nicholas said that Warner had never been out in the 90s when he was 97, Warne got angry at him, and Steyn nicked him off next ball lmao?",3
Nortje has been bettering Rabada throughout the last few matches and then Rabada comes in and picks a few in the death and ends up with better figures. Sad life for Nokia.,10
one collapse please,-2
As a SRH fan I don't know what to expect now... We could very well be all out for another ten runs or we could set a target of 220+.,8
Call me crazy but I prefer the 2018 team with Kanos as the captain when we topped the table. Should’ve won then.,11
The only silver lining is he gets the deserved rest to come and keep for 20 overs.,6
"SRH today:

7 able batsmen

6 able bowlers

And 1 Manish Pandey",14
all hail Saha. What a knock,3
Open with Pant and we might have a chance. Not as if playing him at 4 is proving to be such a great role rn. Rahane is going to kill the chase atleast in the middle he can do what Pant was doing,7
The predicted score now is *220*,5
"Regardless of the output so far, this is the right balance of overseas players for us. Especially when wickets start spinning or getting older in the tournament, bairstow becomes less effective. If we had this combination against punjab, Kane would've definitely taken us home",12
Time for classic shots resulting in fours... It's Kanos time people,3
Should swap Pandey for test and Saha for T20,2
Pandey pls don't ruin this.,3
Manish started tuktuk now,2
"Hence proved: You've to always bat like you're in a do-or-die elimination match, especially in the playoffs. That's the only way to go in T20s",4
The innings of Saha and the squad selection should surely fire up Pant now.,3
Pandey needs to play a sensible run a ball innings here imo,0
Saha ended jonny bairstows ipl for this year.,7
Hey srh i hope kane doesnt fuck up what the openers did lmao,2
Just saw the score now. This is Insane from srh,4
"I'm sensing a Pant masterclass today. He will want to prove to the selectors, and will have a huge chase. Will allow him to play freely.",4
Minimum 10 an over is 230,1
"Wridhi'maar' Saha 


I'm terrible at it nvm",4
Should've sent a finisher,2
Tuk tuk gang here,1
"Calm the fuck down people,  just one good innings and you hype them so much.",3
Styris looks like Captain Barbossa's monkey (from PoTC),2
Time to start the Tuk Tuk!,7
Pandey tuk tuk incoming,2
SRH should just declare,2
If only SRH had dropped Bairstow earlier.,1
lmao pandey finally getting us some dots,7
Will SRH get to 200 now with Pandey there?,2
Ffs. Pandey back to tuk tuk. Atleast take singles man,4
"DC need last match like SRH Kollapse, for any kind of chances",7
"In 2018 IPL, SRH lost matches only when Saha wasn’t in the playing XI.",5
"""Let the tuk tuk begin"" - unpredictable specialist fielder pandey",4
"Rookie move by saha here.

Dhawan would have gone for the 100.",12
"Whenever I see DC it reminds me of Deccan Chargers and their kick-ass theme

Go Chargers
Go Chargers
Go Go Go Go..",7
That was a good catch by iyer under pressure,3
Pandey SR watch: 122,8
Pandey Bhai will fuck up the run rate now.,4
Well left Pandey! 👌,3
Fucking tuktuk Pandey may kill the momentum,2
Great and now Williamson is in to bat.,0
Inb4 Pandey 21(18),4
Shitoinis jinxing  a successful team now after kxip and rcb,3
"This inning had more intent them all our rest of the wicketkeepers!


Like seriously, he could have layed low for an over or 2 and scored his century but he kept the run rate high, full on for the team inning!!


Mad respect.",4
How did Philips connect virat's success with fucking trimmers... I can understand that wierd vitamin that he's advertising but seriously trimmers give you success.. What is this  sorcery,2
pandey-ji starts tuk tuk challenge,3
Downvote me if you want but I have got a feeling that DC will fail to qualify if they lose this. Their next matches are against RCB and MI,6
Damn that was some innings by Saha. I don't like him batting down the order. He can find the gaps and chip over the in field in the powerplays,3
Pandeyji bringing some calm after the storm.,8
"Today's match has the potential to badly damamge DC's NRR, if SRH plays their cards right",3
Pandey should have been benched for the atrocious innings he played the other night,2
Bro Pandey this is not the time for 15(29),6

Strike rotate cheyyi saami nuvvu,3
Cringy SANJAY BANGAR,5
Altroz is such an uggo car,3
Awkward Binga. He don’t care for no Altroz,5
Manish bhai batting on some other surface,0
Pandey is the imposter,1
All aboard the Tuk Tuk express,0
I can never understand how does Pandey keep getting selected in the Indian T20 team.,0
Is this the original Dubai pitch from the start of the tournament? we have seen 200+ chase on that pitch. If not Delhi is definitely fucked.,1
Bairstow was the imposter. The team suddenly starts performing when management dropped YJB. With that being said... Well done to Saha. Good time to get back in form ahead of the AUS Test series.,12
Sanga used all the Altroz lines in one go and said ok I filled my quota,13
Pls Pandey dont play ur usual 120SR innings repeat what you did to RR,11
Lezzo Manish,6
Axar should bowl another over. Can't have Stoinis bowling three overs,2
Pandey SR watch: 136,11
Momentum Kill Bill Pandey,6
Pandey : let me start my tuk tuk boys,5
Now Kane needs to fire. Shouldn't loose the momentum in the last five,11
Saha playing with 200SR with classic touch,6
[deleted],8
"with the way Delhi has been batting recently, it would be hard for us to chase even 150, much less this current 170+",10
That sound 🌝,4
Shot 👏 of 👏 the 👏 day!! 👏,4
Lol even this over went for 10.,9
Man it’s a rough day on the job for DC bowlers,8
Iyer with same facial expressions,5
"You arent supposed to hit a 4 pandey, you have displeased thala. :(",7
Sanga has been reduced to shilling the Altroz. How much are they paying him?,9
Man looks just like Sebastian Vettel,3
Pandey ji lovely shot,5
Pandey SR watch: 136,9
Pandey chutiya,9
"r/cricket jinxing Pandey into not playing tuktuk, damn",15
"Bowl rabada next please, iyer needs to stop saving him for the 20th",2
Why is nobody trying yorker? Fuck Ashish Nehra,8
Tata Marketing Team bringing out the new slogan for the Altroz: Music Box on Wheels,5
People here are so impatient man.,7
200 looks par on this pitch,3
I have thus decided to forfeit this match and just enjoy the gangbang,6
When is rabadas over coming looool,3
Pandey is good player and all but they should have given a chance to SKY in T20s.,10
"Pandey - batting with a man on fire so just rotates strike, doesn't play a dot. 

Some people here - lol tuk tuk Pandey.",8
Pandey will eat up 2 dot balls and hit one handsome boundary on the third ball. I've seen this pattern countless times to stop getting excited with his boundaries.,7
Anything less than 250 would be great. 😬,2
"Saha for mcg hundred

Amirite",7
"If a baby was playing with his toys in the crib and there was a toy Altroz in there, I'd crush it in front of his eyes and laugh as he weeps",3
"175 **and there's still 5 overs to go**.

Baring a miracle SRH get to 220 comfortably.",10
Obligatory “commentators orgasm over a shitty car” cutaway,4
i love kane i love him i really do,2
I think Warner and Kane would have run two for 15.1,3
That purple cap graphic is an eyesore.,2
"From this stage, 250 is doable. However knowing SRH, it'd probably be 210.",4
Don't you hate it when the commentators are having a serious discussion and the cameraman shows Altroz  and they suddenly talk about it,5
[deleted],0
Pandey SR watch: 125,2
Srh should smash it now they have wickets in hand,2
"Pandey needs to keep it up, start flying. He lost them the other game",3
Pandey plays with intent for India though that’s all that matters,10
Any other team would be disappointed with anything less than 240 here but us SRH fans will be happy if we get to 215.,12
"DC: Bowls full and with pace

Goes for boundary 

DC: I’ll do it again",3
No luck. NO FUCKING LUCK.,1
I hope DC doesn't screw up this match... Thier next two matches aren't really easy... Things can go either way,5
Seeing SRH reaching 175 at 15 overs after that fiery start puts that legendary 263 from RCB in context.,3
Single Digit Kanos or Double digit Kanos?,2
"Williamson plays a defensive stroke:- Oh dear, oh dear gorgeous.


Manish plays a defensive stroke:- You fucking donkey.",86
Did I miss Swann in yesterday's and today's match or he hasn't come?,1
Kane got 9 balls left to hit a 50,1
"No idea why Delhi are overlooking Harshal Patel despite the pitches clearly favoring change ups and variations. He's so good at it. 

Tushar adds no versatility to the attack.",6
So Sebastian Vettel got Saha,2
Tuk tuk,5
Only 8 extras,2
Good Guy Pandey felt pity on DC after Warner-Saha gangbang so he's allowing them to crawl back in.,3
Solid defence 😍,2
Bruh tjust 2 yorkers today lmao...,3
Anything under 220 is an achievement for dc,3
"Dominic Cork and Brian Lara together in the coms.

As players I cannot think of another duo where one destroyed the other as much as Lara destroyed Cork.",7
I wonder how many people would buy the altroz from the ipl,7
"Hmmm we are 176/2 in 15 overs, it's a good batting surface. Good time to charge into the ball and practice my frontfoot defence ain't it?",10
"we've only won like what, 1 chase so far?",6
Can everyone stfu with the Pandey tuk tuk drivel? People need time to get their eye in. He'll take it to the bowlers in last few,2
Herschelle Patel khilao yar,7
Pandey SR watch: 107,6
Pandey has been Delhi's best player today.,7
Axar GOAT,0
TUK. FUCKING. TUK.,4
Score ban gaya bhai warner declare kar de,5
Runrate going down now. Damn. I was hoping for 240,4
Pandey the ultimate run rate killer,2
"I remember this match when India crossed 300 with 4 overs to go and Dravid had not been sent to bat. He came out as a finisher and twatted a half century in 20 balls or something to take the score to 350.   

That's what SRH need from Kane now.",19
Pandey just completely undoing the work done by Saha and Warner. How he made the T20 team is completely beyond me,9
Come on SRH please don't fk up from here,7
Pandey - Doing a bit there lads.,8
"Well, atleast intent is there.",13
"Even though Axar and Ash are lovely bowlers and doing a more than decent job, I still feel that DC are missing the services of a quality leg spinner.",4
Pandey SR watch: 117,10
This is the first time I've had Rabada as my fantasy team captain so I take full responsibility,36
Isko out mat karna,5
Where was rahane going initially lol,1
Atleast Pandey trying to hit out or get out.,5
"No tuktuk now, please",1
YJB gets cucked in every team he play for :/,2
"Anyone getting annoyed by Pant shouting ""Easy"" to the fielder after every ball ?",5
Rabada/Nortje should bowl next one.,7
I don't see DC chasing this even if dhawan gets a 100 again.,5
Pandey mate are you kidding me? Who selected this man for t20is ahead of Pant and SKY????,8
Why showing soooo much respect to Axar!!!!,3
"2 matches where we needed Shaw the most, we haven't played him lol",4
How is Pandey.... i give up,5
Anything under 210 will be a psychological win now,6
How is Pandeyji  allowed to come at 3,8
Pandey you're an premiere Indian batsmen how can u be mug against left arrm spin,3
Fuck Manish,1
We our supposed to be the *youngsters* but our fielding has been fucking atrocious. Shaw is singled out but I see everybody fielding like that,5
Rashid biting nails worried about this highway pitch,5
"Laxman stresses on the word ""Impact"" everytime SRH buys someone or retains someone. Saha would have been the last player on his mind whenever he has said that lmao. What a great innings.",7
Pandey brings calmness to the proceedings. Whether it's needed or not.,16
Is Instagram Reels meant to be a tiktok alternative? Clearly I don't use that app.,6
DC please get Pandeyji out,3
[deleted],7
Pandey over SKY for T20Is is a joke,13
Let’s restrict them to 210 come on,3
I’m happy dc is gonna lose this because it gives rcb a good chance to finish in top 2 but like Delhi really deserves to at least get into the finals this year,6
Why would you not bowl 18 and 20 from Tushar is beyond me!,3
"DTDC has the most 90s looking ad of 2020.


And I don't think it was intentional.",5
Pandey is our No. 5/6 selectors should be ashamed,7
Axar bowled relatively well yet again.,6
It'd be downright criminal if thry won't reach 230 from here!!,10
"Don't worry DC fans, today our batting is fine.. obligatory shitty bowling performance is loading..",13
Batting pitch or poor bowling?,4
I switch to dugout as soon as Anjum Chopra comes one,1
"I think 230 is what they should get, anything less would probably be enough, but a disappointment for sure",5
Now watch the pitch slow down and Delhi struggle to get 140,5
Man fuck Pandey.,6
Anything less than 226 would be disappointing,4
"With Lara and Cork together, these guys should get Tendulkar and Kasperowicz on board for the ultimate 90s fuck bunny reunion.",3
Pandey looking to hit it too hard...,2
Pandey bruh,4
Orey nee.....enni mingutaavayya Manishuu,9
If this match couldnt have been worse Anjum Chopra has to also commentate on that,4
SRH trying to stay under 200 to keep it competitive :-/,2
Manish Pandey is playing beautifully.,2
"Crazy how the last few days or so of matches have just been top half teams getting beaten by bottom half teams

Has spiced things up very nicely",5
Hit wicket kar lo pandeyji,4
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",1
Axar should always finish his quota. At least they learnt that!,3
Tbf it's not easy on these pitches to start slogging from ball one.,4
One of the biggest part of this match is also RR. If DC get wrecked here this could actually start becoming a factor.,3
Just get Dhawan and game is yours srh,10
What happened to Pandey? 15 balls is enough to settle down?,-1
How the fuck is Pandey hitting every ball to his own feet lol,6
Honest question: Has the pitch slowed down?,1
As a neutral its frustrating to watch Pandey,3
"I believe we scored the highest runs this playoffs at 228, right? Can SRH beat that?",3
Fucking hell tuk tuk pandey. Man killed all momentum alone ffs,4
"Today we saw vintage Warner. Maybe he was struggling with power or timing or just form in general, but an inform Warner is the best player to watch who plays all over the park with hard hitting and running.",2
What do you guys think of R Ashwin not getting selected in Whiteball squad?,1
Axar not being picked in the T20 squad is a crime too.,5
Pandey channeling inner laxman.,2
Saha was Voyager. Sent out on a specific mission but just kept going.,8
*Laughs in SKY*,-1
WTF???? Why the fyck can these people not hit the ball!!!Atleast try you stupid fucks,0
Why isn't Axar in the India team :'(,0
"Can someone develop a ""Sanga back in the comm box"" alert bot",3
Pandey SR watch: 123,2
Hit out or get out @Kanos and Manish,1
Manish Pandey middles the ball and it hits his toe. Great player in the making,6
Bc taang laga deta yar,2
This is the guy we have picked for INDIA's T20 Squad?,6
The problem with having South Africans play a key role in your team is that South Africans always tend to choke towards the backend of tournaments.,7

Don’t bowl length my man!,2

What a shot beautiful,1
Deshpande : Another soul scythed by the Universe Boss,2
So Hetmyer is test and ODIs specialist now,3
You guys think Pandey gets a lot of abuses every IPL in his DM?,6
"If srh doesn't fuck up like last game, what's our situation to make the playoffs??",6
"I think in T20s 

SKY > Rana > Kishan > Pandey",8
"DC peaked too early, didn't they.",2
Pandey 21(17) making laxman proud. Haha,3
Pandey hits a boundary and then dots the other deliveries.,2
"Won't this break delhi morale,so many losses.",3
Only Pandey fails to hit absolute pies,14
You can take 5-6 balls to get settle but taking 18 balls to settle is just shitting batting in T20,5
[deleted],6
Wow srh middle order is slow af. Especially after that acid trip by Saha.,6
DC just need to get 8 wickets from here.,6
Bowling shit saves runs,1
"One boundary isnt gonna cut it this time, pandey",5
"Tushar is built very strongly.. he doesn't need to join Dinda academy to be honest. I think he needs a good bowling coach so he can ""bowl the heavy ball"".",6
"Cricket is so easy bro.


Why don't the batters hit more runs? Simple hai yaar kitna.",27
"I never saw Pandey take a full toss to a cleaner. He almost always plays a dot.

Edit: Yikes!! I loved it!",4
Grunts while hitting a full toss to mid wicket,2
"Pandey literally won a game singlehandedly 4 or 5 days ago. He had a shit day against kxip, but I find it ridiculous how fickle minded most people are on here.

Not everyday is your day, and in Pandey's case most days aren't his, but he is far from a terrible player. Sport is unpredictable and players will fail more often than not.

People need to chill the fuck out with the unnecessary hate towards players.",38
finally,2
Pandey wants to get into the test squad too !,1
"Gabbar bhai ek aur century

But then rest of them would probably make like 50",6
"Would love Kings XI to somehow get the 2nd seed, even though chances are slim",1
That wasn't the saha I knew,1
Yes length balls. Behenchod marwa lo apni,6
Axar and Vijay Shankar look like the same person 🤔,1
Bc faster umesh yadav. 2 good bas then ek lolly ball guaranteed,3
[deleted],-2
Peak pandey was the RR innings,9
Tushar bowl yorkers my man,1
10 runs is  a bad over for SRH. Need 12+.,2
I don't see SRH keeping Bairstow for the 2021 season. He's very likely going to be released. Plus Saha fills the WK-Batsman quota anyway and this frees up an overseas slot for the team to invest in someone else.,2
Ben stokes there's 3 more overs to go..,6
God biggest ipl score kaunsa hai. I fear it might get crossed today,4
Bro did she just say that Manish Pandey has been consistent?,6
Placement boi,4
Where are all Pandey haters?,31
Pandey ji 👏👏👏,1
Get fucked,5
spray and pray,1
DC vs Punjab eliminator then lol,5
Finally. This over was terrible from Tushar though,4
Manish showing I N T E N T today,3
You know you're doing bad when anjum Chopra says you're Batting well,4
Eat shit pandey haters,6
Shottt,1
Is Harshal really poor than Tushar?,8
Tushar is as good as Thakur,4
Full toss bc,2
Length ball or full tosses. Amazing!,3
People are after Manish Pandey with pitchforks.,8
Alright he is trying,4
"Chalo, ab next match bhi khelega Tushar. GG",4
"Deshpande is just not very good, should bring harshal back next game",3
Deshpiede,5
He's back boiis. The Pandey of yore!,3
How are they making it look like its sharjah,4
"We are talking about Saha and Warner missing out on their century, talk about Sehwag missing out on his triple century. Would have equalled Sir Jadeja with 3 FC 300s if he just played safe for 7 more runs.",12
Suryakumar fans have gone into hiding.,3
Pandey heard r/cricket chatting shit,11
SRH would be very disappointed if they just got to the projected score of 226,3
"Manish ""Dekh raha hoon Bhosdike"" Pandey",10
"Pandey finally caught a string, he got the muscle to hit now yall",1
"When will Ponting learn, Tushar is a shit bowler..",7
"MI best bowling side in powerplays, KKR in middle overs & KXIP best at the slog overs.",0
Woah !!!,1
"Chucked a pie, or as my mom calls it, chucked it like a laddu",1
The real hurdle's been cleared. Pandey ji is set to strike the ball for this match!,1
One of the top 3 are absolutely going to choke away their spot aren’t they?,5
What if DC lose all their upcoming matches?,3
I thought slower deliveries are better in big grounds.,2
"Everyone just has to come into form against DC lmao Narina, Rana, Warner, Saha and even Pandey now",4
"We kinda joke but Delhi has a genuine chance to be out of top 4 even with how bad they have been for quite some time

The contrast between when Iyer was injured and Dhawan captained vs Iyer's captaincy is also yuuuuge",2
Punjab needed 1 run in 3 balls and they choked. Delhi needs 1 win in 3 games and.. 🙃,5
Hope Saha can rest easy.,2
Alia Bhatt is so cute yaar,-1
"I don't understand why SRH fans shitting on Pandey, guy is playing amazing shots",9
What happened to Saha today?,3
"Remember the days when DC was the best bowling team by far?

Yeah, we remember. 

*cries*",10
Pandey haters where are you?,11
It's like everyone here is watching cricket for the first time.,15
"Lol, she said Pandey got into the groove asap, but he started 17 off 16",3
Don’t understand the appeal of this Deshpande guy when you have experienced Harshal Patel,3
"Delhi looks demotivated AF. The life seems to have been sucked out of them with the recent string of defeats, and now that Hyderabad have shown that Rabada can be dealt with their bowling will now be able to be dealt with. I can definitely see Punjab taking their spot in the playoffs.",6
DC bowlers need to do a Sam Curran here.,3
"Rahane, Iyer, and Pant NEED to step up today if we even want to make this game respectable.",2
Why is this fucker giving Stoinis an over!,0
Stoinis to rescue,1
Meanwhile Kane looking sexy as fuck and chilling at the other end.,2
Mid-match apology threat for Manish Pandey incoming?,3
Pandey se bada Deshpande,4
"Watch Rabada come back and take a couple of wickets, completely changing the game",3
So how close is Pandeyji to earning his lordship?,1
Unrelated question: Did they scrap the rule of playing an uncapped indian player in the playing XI or am I mistaken thinking there was such a rule in the first place when IPL started?,2
Kohli iyer and manish panday in same t20 team doesn't sound great on paper but we have to see.,2
"I feel Williamson is the best person to target Rabada at the death. He is a great timer. He did it to Jofra, can he do it to Rabada?",4
Country boi Pandey vs Regular Pandey,3
"If srh wins , can we host a biriyani party?",2
I feel hyderabad are more hungrier for that 2 points.,3
Whoa. It seems like Rabada became Siraj today.,2
"YJB is defo headbutting everything in sight rn

Losing his SRH spot to Saha & Stokes scoring 100 opening for RR",6
Are they playing Kenny g in the stadium??,1
Tushar taken to the cleaners ... hahaha,3
Ferrari fucked Seb so hard he had to come play IPL for Delhi,1
Deshpande to Pandey,5
"Iyer is such a fucking moron, bowl rabada ffs",2
Shouldn't they bowl Rabada or Nortje now instead of Stoinis?,1
They should just play Daniel Sams as the fifth bowler. Neither Harshal nor Tushar has done anything tolhis season to justify their selection.,1
"People talking shit about Manish Pandey forget that he is our insurance against a 49/10.

As long as we have him that will not happen.",8
r/cricket is r/wsb of Cricket,2
Why Kane playing like a CSK batsman?,1
What happened to Harshal patel? He was decent in few matches,4
"*Player hits a boundary*

Commentators: iS tHiS tHe dReAm 11 gAmEcHaNgEr oF tHe mAtCh",1
Manish Pandey plays well only when r/cricket shits on him.,3
Deshpande is too big we need to agree on an easier nick name asap,1
Shreyas and Pant have to score big today.,2
"It was fun while it lasted. But as Delhi fans, we always knew we are fully capable of doing something like this.",2
Is Stoinis single?,2
220+ or go home,4
Aah the Marquee Bowler back at it!,2
"Delhi getting CARTED

YOU LOVE TO SEE IT",3
Is there anyway DC does not qualify if they lose all remaining matches? I like the team just that arrogant DC fans will get a good taste in their mouth.,5
No ball?,3
Not all can strike from ball one every match. People need to calm down before criticising Pandey. Last match too the RRR was less so Pandey played accordingly and was unlucky to get out before accelerating.,9
Any bets on final score? I say 235,2
Rabada and Nortje have been off color today. But they will probably bounce back in their final over. They have to target this over.,3
"Okay, I am curious, how is the points table affected if DC lose today ?",4
Williamson started exactly like Pandey but everyone shits on Pandey. This is how most people start an innings.,16
This looks like a completely different pitch from the RCB CSK game,5
Pandey SR watch: 157,10
Surely that was a no ball? So high,8
No ball???,8
Man this is some 2009 SF level of PTSD from Hyderabad,6
So many full tossess to Pandey,3
Keep shitting on him boys or he will start tuk tuk,10
"DC chose to field. DC CHOSE TO FIELD.

let that sink in",17
What is this?,3
Surely a no ball,5
Give them more gifts while you're at it,1
I guess people would be happy with Pandey getting out and SRH collapse for 190 rather than him take a couple of overs to get his eye in and score 40-50 in last 3-4 overs. Morons,7
Stoinis wtf is up with the literal pie chucking?,3
How is that not a no ball,5
"199 already?!

Wow this is brilliant batting by SRH",3
Manish Pandey is perfect for no.5 place in ODI for sure!,8
122 from boundaries tonight,3
Oh boy we reached 200 guys! How fucking long has it been.,3
Unpopular opinion on this sub: I think manish pandey is a decent T20I player. I don't really know much of his IPL record but he seems good in T20I,7
Dugout looking much sober today without Swann.,7
Seeing how Stoinis is bowling it’s probably a better surface for a medium pacer than a genuine quick. Might work more in SRH’s favor.,10
Manish Pandey is on Most sixes list woah,7
Was that not over waist height?,5
Kishan with 20 sixes off 8 matches is...well it's amazing,2
Fun fact: Jonny Bairstow has only played 3 test matches less than Steve Smith (70 to 73).,11
That’s harsh. Looked like a no ball,8
No way DC chasing this,5
Lol 23 boundaries on this big ground. DC are out of sorts and at the worst time too.,2
"Regardless if srh makes tops 4, would love to fuck over some other teams in our remaining games",7
"Fucking hell Sunrisers have battered DC’s bowling. Think only Axar with sub 10 economy.

Edit: Huh, Nortje too. Felt like he was more expensive than 27 off 3.",7
Wtf is kane doing. Hit it mate,8
Why did Williamson try to stop it as if he was a goalkeeper,12
Pandey SR watch: 154,6
He got 8 of those 6s against RR,3
Stoinis has been unironically our best bowler,10
Bruh this is the over to hit next is Rabada-Nortje,7
Samad might come in if they loose a wicket now,6
I'm sure Khaleel was dropped just for the lack of intent and IQ.,14
Ponting on the receiving end of hammering like '03 final. Sweet karma.,2
what alternate universe have I stepped in,4
Sould have ideally given Stoinis the last over. Iyer's gamble paid off though,3
"Kane mama, milking in the death, or he is trying to give strike back to Pandey. r/cricket is trolled by kanos",9
"Kanos : strikes at 100 r/cricket: oh dear oh dear gorgeous 


Pandey: strikes at 150 : you fucking donkey",89
The wicketkeeper batsman spot in India is so stacked that someone like Kishan isn't even considered for any of the 3 formats,8
I can see Vijay Shankar fucking DC here with his slow balls,8
Gayle scoring 175 probably will never be beaten. What do you guys think?,14
Teams trying to prove they can chase are really just harming themselves at this point,2
Could've sent in Holder instead of Kane.,5
Iyer (tonight)- _Rabada leaked too many runs._,9
Pant fans claim will be tested today-  once in a generation talent,3
Don’t get lured into giving Stoinis another over because of this lol,1
"Choose 1
DC 163 all out
DC 147/8 in 20 overs",2
"Just tuning in...damn, looks like the lower sides are rebelling against their overlords.",6
This innings is a peak example of “killing it softly”. No crash Big Bang cricket. No Galaxy Bosses laying waste. Just genuine cricketing shots which makes you wonder how did they reach this score,8
360 degrees is going to have great bowling figures today,3
Last 2 overs 30+ runs at least?,4
"Stoinis bowling good lol, wtf is happening",5
What a poor death by SRH. Good job Pandey,4
Srh broke the mental block DC had worked hard to ingrain in every team regarding their bowling.,6
So Rabada won't be bowling his last?,6
we'll have a bowl thanks,7
Stoinis has been their best bowler wtf,9
"we have nothing to lose from here, just hit 6s bc",6
Only 6 runs in 18th over by Stoinis what is this Sorcery,6
Looks like DC is f**ked,1
Holy fuck Kane get a move on,3
"Honestly what the fuck are these two doing? Should have sent in Samad or Holder. You have 8 fucking wickets in hand, attempt an aerial shot, maybe? Fuck sake.",12
Ahhhh the horror,1
This is exactly the kind of game that needs a Pant grandslam. If only he wasn’t irresponsible af with the bat,3
Where's the shitting on Williamson for scoring 5(6) when Pandey is slogging at 150+ SR?,9
Wtf only 6 in this over,2
Off cutters are working. So I guess SRH will do well with the ball,2
Should have sent in Holder or Rashid to have a swing at it. Wickets aren't gonna hurt SRH anyway,7
Guys can you bully Kane into form? Thanks,4
Kane wth man,5
"Vijay Shankar will unironically be a handful on this pitch

SRH's lack of pace will help them as well",3
So Pandey is striking better than Williamson and this thread is shitting on Pandey. Smh,6
"Aakash chopra just said
"" Gendbaaz ka naam marcus h par abhi kas ke maar rahe hain manish"" 😭",7
Uhhh... I just turned the match on. Wtf?,2
What are they waiting for lmao,2
Have a feeling Rashid would get smashed today.,1
Stoinis God with that bowling in this innings,3
Kanos is playing a terrible knock. He should have been in double figures. SRH should get 230 with that start.,5
I really doubt that DC can chase this score,5
Stonis has been DC's best bowler by some margin.,5
This is neither Single Digit Kanos nor Double Digit Kanos. It's Tuk Tuk Kanos.,3
I think 215 - 220 will be the target unlike 250+ as thought previously..,4
"Kane 'Steady the ship' Williamson is so wholesome he's not even hitting boundaries.

Aww!",2
"Come on SRH, get a move on!!",3
Stoinis needs to have a chat with Rabada,6
230 plizz.,2
Kane match ki laga raha hai,2
"Manish actually has been very good for india in the T20 series against NZ. He saved India in a couple of games. He deserves his place, maybe over Iyer who has been excellent in ODIs but not yet in T20Is.",10
"Law of averages killed Rabada today, I fucking hope Law of averages put Hetmyer into godlike form",8
Will Rabada continue the streak? I say he'll get an edge off of Kanos,4
Handsome duo. ❤️,8
I'm just tuned in for the fantasy points at this point,6
[deleted],-2
DC realizing that slower balls work too late,3
[deleted],0
"This is where we miss someone like Russell, Pollard, Pandya. No settling down. Bang bang from ball one.",11
"The dude putting these orange/purple caps in scorecard thinks hes got the PNG rookie memer mistake

It looks fucking ugly. An ugly ass white square in scorecard and bowling figures",8
Tuk tuk started,1
Pandey plays every ball to the leg side man!,2
Wriddhiman Saha could have done wonders for a team like CSK this season but he is languishing on the bench so far.,8
Reminder - Pandey took 18 balls to settle.,1
people here were asking kanos to come to csk. I see why now atleast,3
"SRH are gonna fuck over our top 2 chances, won't they? Especially looking at past history of us losing important games to them......",4
Kanos struggling with his rhythm tonight. Did something happen?,1
Omg Rabada has to get a wicket or else streak is over omg omg,4
"r/cricket when a player has  a bad day : What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.",12
Smash it srh,1
Kanos needs to go big,1
people of r/cricket who hate on Manish Pandey for no reason :- please jump on your on asses and die. Thank you.,7
If Rahane wants to contribute positively he has to cut flick and drive his way to 40(20) during the powerplay and then swing at literally every ball after it ends. He can't keep up with the rate with 4 fielders outside the circle.,1
DC only bowling full tosses to Pandey.,3
"How good has Stoinis been for DC this season. Whenever the team is in trouble, he stands up and does the job in all departments. Be it death batting or bowling, or just fixing the dirty work, he has been so consistent. His pace is up too, and has bowled nice yorkers. Far better than Maxi, Warner, and Finch.",5
Ok slower balls barage is coming guys,1
This is just sad to watch now,1
if dc manage to chase this successfully i will be very impressed,2
Why is Stoinis crying?,1
"People who were complaining about pandey should get ready with kane batting,  maybe he needs nz small grounds",5
"Want srh to win, but rabada should get a wicket here just to keep his record going!",6
Who was that person in this thread who wanted a 200+ score?',5
wtf are they doing!!!!!!!,5
Change of pace doing the trick for DC now,4
Was Kanos the right person to send in at this stage?!,7
Could've been 250,7
Nortje bowling Bhatia pace cant make this up,3
Rishab Pant 100(32)* loading today?,4
"With this performance, DC should be happy if they qualify, let alone get the top 2 spot.",3
Slagging the 150 SR guy over the sub 100 tuk tukker...,5
I hate DC. I hate their arrogance. I hate that they were hyped on back of one rescuejob by Stoinis after a pathetic start. I hate Ashwin and his ongoing milking of mankading for last 1 year to stay relevant. I hate Ponting's smirk even after they lose. I hate Prithvi Shaw's lack of temperament. I hate how no one in their batting order apart from Dhawan has stepped up to the challenge. I hate that they have 14 points. Thank you SRH for spanking them today. Please this is my sincere request to other clubs to pull them out of top 4 and show them their real place. God I hate them.,-11
They should go with Stoinis for final over. Rabada doesnt deserve to complete his quota today.,5
We used to call that a National Wide...,9
Kanos maama rendu sixlu saalu.,6
"After injury, Nokia's pace has gone done by 10 clicks atleast",5
Only 13% slower balls. They didn't learn from RCB,7
"SRH : "" oh, what that ? Your the best bowling side now eh ? Lemme just check that real quick """,12
Rabada will get 3 wickets in his last over to maintain the lead,7
"Rabada is my Captain for today. The -2 points he has, has doubled to -4. *Stonks*",27
"God damn it murali we know you're the stats guru, stop throwing random stats on us",2
Just imagine the reaction if Pandey was 6 of 7 xD,10
"If Holder had come out instead of Kanos, they would have made 240.",2
"Calling it out , last over 36",1
These 2 are batting like it's 150-8,2
Not our today. Again.,1
Think that DCs bowlers missed a trick by not trying more slower balls. This pitch is very suited to SRH’s bowling.,2
Lucky there,1
Honestly if we lose Kanos to another team I will legit cry.,4
Rabada isn't bowling his full quota of overs...,2
When it's not your day,1
"To chase this, DC needs to open with Pant-Dhawan

Not Rahane pls",3
Theory: these two are not playing badly. The pitch has slowed down which means DC will have problem chasing it.,4
[deleted],17
Whats williamson trying to do,4
Absolutely no luck today,4
Please don’t bowl Deshpande for the last over. I don’t know why but I get the feeling that he’s going to bowl it.,5
What a great Yorker.,3
[deleted],10
Pant is gonna take out his anger of not not getting selected in the Indian team by making an aggressive century,5
Pandey SR watch: 160,15
Bruh😂😂😂😂,5
Well left Pandey ji... crazy one..,3
Lol nice leave Pandey ji,4
Nutmeg,4
Haven't seen that arrogant dc fan for a while haha,9
The infallible bowling attack of DC is pretty... fallible.,7
"Pandey is smashing nortje, no excuses for playing a run a knock ""sensible"" innings today from any of ours",2
Masterclass leave,2
Wut?,1
Yo wtf pandey,0
Pandey ji showing dance moves nice 1,0
"Forgive me, lads, for I have missed Lord Saha's glorious comeback",3
Great leave from Pandey,3
"Hahahahahaha, what? xD",2
Oh so this is ball dancing. Haha,1
Lol,2
"What kind of Bharatnatyam was that, Mr. Pandey?",7
There's hardly an answer to a yorker ever. Delhi bowlers have so far bowled 4 of them.,4
Proper Pandeyji leave that!,3
Good bowling,2
gg nice ball.,1
A 28 ball 50 for Manish Pandey coming up! For the haters.,1
Why did he let himself get megged wtff pandeyji,2
Pandey has started breakdancing 🤣,1
Scorer is sleeping. Missed the wide and score should be 209,4
I love the cheeky smiles all around,6
Kottayya Pandey,5
what a delivery wow,5
People are laughing at him at this point,7
We are actually taking our frustration of KKIP on DC today.,8
They won’t even get to 230 at this rate,4
"Good fucking luck, India. Good fucking luck batting with Iyer and Pandey at 4 and 5. More power to you.",11
Our last game is against SRH and its going to be crucial for our top 2 chances *gulps*,13
Wide hai bc,7
That is ridiculously cheeky,0
"Man, 6 off 7.

SRH could be 220 by now and looking at 230+",4
"Nokia bowls outside leg stump, inside the leg",2
Bro What's up with Dominic Cork making Nazi Salute and all? 😭😂😭😂,-1
the assholes in this subreddit are some of the most toxic annoying piece of shits. Can you not harass a player just because he isn't hitting a 4 or 6 every ball? Pandey is still striking above 150 which is still a good strike rate for an accumulator like him. God you guys bring out the worst in cricket fans. Kindly f\*\*k off,18
How natural it is to slog towards the leg side for any batsman. I guess every one in general needs to have a strong off side game for the last 2 overs atleast. Wide outside off has become a potent weapon only bettered by a yorker in T20s. This one area where Hardik is good where he just muscles the off side ball no matter what. Just my observation.,0
ffs pandey,-2
Isn't that a wide. Wtf!?,4
what does srh winning today do the their chances of playoff's?,0
What a limp finish,5
His fists huh?,7

Is nortje a french name?,4
That was a wide too.,9

I love the dugout. That was a good analysis of Nortje's variations.,0
Calm the fuck down about Pandey guys. You can't hit every single ball for a six especially if someone like Nortje is bowling.,2
"Some DC players look shocked, others are smiling.

This will be an interesting chase.",1
"Should've left it, would've been wide again",2
~~SRH~~ URH,0
Rabada take a wicket pls,3
"Prediction. 

• Rahane gets out first couple of overs. 

• Dhawan shows some promise but gets fucked over (runout i reckon)

• Iyer and Pant play a 10(9) and start accelerating. Get out after a couple of boundaries. 

• Stoinis, Hetmyer and Axar all get a couple boundaries and sky the ball straight to a fielder. 

Or by some miracle all of them come in form",7
So why is r/cricket not shitting on Kane like they did on Manish a while ago,9
Man they should have got 230 :/,5
Not hating on Pandey but his batting style is absolute crass. Very one dimensional. Although kudos to him he does the job most days than not,5
Kane is off tonight,5
Thala Williamson,2
Should Rahane even come out to try and chase this? Retired out could be a better option.,5
Can sunrisers qualify if they win all their matches since they have a good nrr? Or will it still depend on other results?,0
SRH have really regressed in these last 5 overs,4

"Dominic Cork talking about bowling indicators, gets PTSD after Lara tells him he never bothered looking at that.",4
Rabada has a wicket streak to maintain. Williamson could cement his nice guy image by leaving a straight one.,4

Rabada is a human after all,6
Should have been 240 easy.,7
Get him to 0-60 at least.,5
*THE STREAK IS BROKEN*,5
Lol rabada has carry bags under his eyes already.,6
Williamson fan boys are really going after Pandey.,6
DC management so shambolic they might release rabada cause of today,4

Why the fuck DC choosed to bowl first? hardly any team has won chasing in Dubai. Was it slip of tongue?,7

Come in manish bat selfishly and get that 50,6
"Ight Bois, see you next season.",10
Rabada wicketless today then?,7
Casually smashing the best bowler of the tournament for a 50.,6
The butterfly stroke of cricket!,4
The last time Rabada went wicketless was against SRH...also conceded 59 runs that game,8
this is a limp finish but I'd still take this score. It is 70 more than what I expected from this batting line up,8
"full and straight Rabada, stump him",2
Terrible finish by SRH but its okay,8
Run fuckers...,5
Chubby cheeky panty.,7
Imagine Pant fails and Iyer scores an aggressive century. r/cricket is kill,7

Pandey is so shit i swear,3

What the fuck is this batting? Not even going formit,0
More disappointed than when Undertaker lost his streak at WrestleMania.,5

Wow Manish Pandey 42 off 30 . Amazing strike rate . Take that haters,5
"Dubai: Look at me, I'm the Sharjah now",14
23 off the last 3 overs. This is still enough for SRH but like it could have been 230-240.,3
Look at people now dissing Rabada for this performance while he sits at the top of Purple Cap list,6
"This was poor from SRH. I don’t blame Pandey or Kane, but they shouldn’t have been sent in at this stage. This could cost them the match",4
Yeah they wasted Stoinis over,3
ffs 230 yaar,2
I'll take 217 not going to lie. I was expecting a collapse to 190,6
"And just like that, Rabadas streak is over. 😔",4
"After Warner's and Saha's innings, I expected more than 219 but still this is above par",6
So the streak is broken for Rabada.....,14
The streak is gone 😭,8
"I mean there's no way we can chase this still, but impressive choke given the fast 12 over start",-3
This is what I expected for the finish so I'm happy with it.,13
Pandey and Kanos are the worst batsmen to have if you want to accelerate,7
Great over. 😍,3
"Yea nah DC aint winning this one, SRH will kill it with the slower balls",4
RIP the Streak,6
44(31) is shit for batting at the death,11

they should have easily reached 240,0
and the streak is broken!!,2
DC dodged a bullet. They looked like conceding 240 at one stage,1
My man Rabada with Siraj stats today :O,4
"Wicketless Rabada with going for 54 runs..

WOW",1
We score 219 and people still complain that we should’ve scored 240. Shut the fuck up.,8

We pulled it back a bit at the end lol! They are 20 runs short lol.,1
Wicketless rabada :(,4

"Bruh, 220 to chase, will take an exhibition of batting to get across, SRH already know Slow balls will kill the chase, they should win it comfortably",2
"RCB fans, having Déjà vu seeing DC bowling.",3

Pandey looks properly disappointed in himself.,2
No........ Rabada goes wicketless. Look how they massacred my boy.,8
Open with Stoin you cowards,3
Pandey SR watch: 142,4
Fuck it send Stoinis to open Rahane gonna fuck up the chase,2
Ok I was scared 240-250. 218 is still doable but DC needs to put it's foot down.,2
Finally we ended Rabada’s streak!,3
Should have sent Williamson at 3,4
Are we allowed to say on this particular subreddit that Williamson cost them 10-15 runs minimum or is that a bannable offence.,29
Still think they did good even though it slowed down. Srh Bowlers game to loose I reckon,6
two batsmen went at 194 strike rate facing more than 40 balls. The other guy faced 30 balls and his strike rate is 140.,0
"No 243+ score

*Moral Victory*",7
44 off last 5 overs. Good finish for SRH standards.,7
23 runs last 3 overs is a steal for dc,7
Rabada scored a 50 today,0
Should have gotten 240+ with the starts Warner and Saha gave.,3
23 off the last three when you are only two down?,8
I feel like bowlers' bad days get more criticised than batsmen's.,2
"23 of the last 3 is underwhelming for any team, but kinda expected and happy for SRH Fans.",8
Imagine saying Suryakumar is better than Pandey lmao he just outdid Williamson now 😭😂😭😂😭😂,-8
"All these comments about we should have could have scored 230/240, we don't have big finishers like other teams. So this i in line with what is expected.",9
I hope we can learn from the first innings and find ways to improve our bowling.,1
moral victory for Delhi,-1
Pandey at 5 will be useless for Indian T20 unless it's a rescue from collapse.,5
26-1,0
"SRH batted amazingly but 44 in the last 5 is pathetic with the start they got.

Still it’s a competitive total",3
Wow Rabada's first wicketless game,6
Great from Kane Williamson there 👍. Really justifies one of the IPLs top run scorers in the last two years being dropped doesn’t it.,-7
"If DC end up collapsing this game, it will be a big dent in the NRR for them.",3
"44(31) and 10(11) is terrible after that start from SRH. 

Pandey really shouldn't be a finisher for India in the T20s lol",4
"Shit last over tbh

Fairly underwhelming finish but Delhi will need Dhawan or Pant to go big today",1
Pant's revenge innings incoming,3
220 is a great score people.....,3
Lol Kane batted worse than Pandey and yet everyone is going after Manish.,7
"This has to be some of the worst death batting I’ve seen tbh. You have 8 wickets in hand, Saha and Warner have left out the perfect platform to make 230, all you need to do is hit some good aerial shots and try clear the rope, or be a bit more attacking. If you get out, that’s fine, 5 overs left with the likes of Rashid, Shankar, Samad and Holder to come. 

This is really underwhelming given the start, they didn’t even make 220. Maybe the pitch slowed down, then fair enough. Otherwise, poor stuff considering how much pies there were too",3
Rabada is not a bot. Confirmed.,4
DC will chase this with 2 overs left after Rahane scores 102 (30).,10
">KG Rabada goes wicket-less for the first time in 26 games.

Man, DC are so done for this season.",3
Williamson wasted balls,7
Rabada to be dropped,1
Rabada Academy,1
Weights transferred to Bowlers,3
They scored 219 and are still being criticized by the gurus at r/cricket,19
Should've been over 220 but ok,2
"Are you kidding 2 wickets in the power play and it's a goneski, they also have Rashid.",2
220 is a pretty good total. Sure we should have had 10-20 more but we take what we can get and it’s a sign the pitch is evolving to the bowling sides favour.,3
If India plays Pandey at 5 for T20s there is no way India has a chance of winning the T20 WC,1
"Guys, if SRH does win, what happens to the points table then ?",3
If Rabada is the best bowler in this generation then it shows how the standards have dropped. Previous generation's best bowlers never had an off day. You never saw Malcolm Marshall get hammered.,-13
Love to see overconfident DC fans being salty and sad.,8
Lmao I'm seeing people criticise Pandey more than williamson,3
"We're not 20 short, ffs. If we can't defend 220, we don't deserve to stay in this tournament anyway.",9
We need 200 from 16 overs and 20 from the Rashid 4 overs without losing any wicket.,6
Pitch slowed up or realised you have to for slower balls?,3
Of course Rabada goes wicketless for the first time in 26 games when I make him my fantasy captain.,20
Today DC will pay the price of Saha having once in a lifetime kind of inning.,4
"**Kagiso Rabada**

Can't believe I am going to say this but Williamson was the worst batsmen today... With Saha and Manish Pandey having played full innings...,9
"Excellent last over.

And that marks the end of Rabada's wicket taking streak.",4
"Pandey's innings wasn't great but I swear people just need an excuse to abuse him

Far better innings than Williamson but who gets all the flack?",11
Chad SRH batsmen were too much for virgin Rabada,5
23 of the last three is a STEAL,9
Can we borrow RR to chase this please?,5
OG Shami can now catch up to Rabada,6
You know your team is in trouble when Marcus Stoinis of all people is your most economical bowler,8
Reactionary Kohli would drop Rabada next game and pick Isuru Udana instead.,5
"Stoinis and Dhawan to open, Pant at 3, gotta be the way to go.",7
OpenThePant. PantToOpen,6
Now to see if everyone is right that this is a flatty where 210 is par or if maybe SRH actually just batted well,4
Pant should open,2
Rabada not getting a wicket sums up DC's bowling performance today!,5
"I think with any sort of acceleration, they would've got 240. Like 2-3 overs of 15+ in overs 16-20 (they only got 1 15 run over).",4
Get DaOne early and SRH will have two...points.,3
Our batters if want to come to form this could be about right fucking time. Dont send Rahane to open pls,4
Man that Pandey Saha partnership was HARD,6
"As crazy as it sounds, 219 feels like a win for DC.",8
I need Pant to score 100 :(,8
"This thread sounds like an indian dad when his son gets 95/100 , beats him up for not getting 100/100",27
Please don't be under any illusion. We aren't chasing this. The best case scenario would be to not fuck up NRR too much,7
Let's gooooooooooo! Let's shake up the table baby!!,7
"Given our batting record this season ,we would take anything above 160.",14
I hope ajju plays a blinder of a test innings. /s,3
I hope everyone realizes this score is not at sharjah. It's at Dubai.,8
Pant should open lmao 🤣,6
Don't have any hope for SRH but another injury? Damn,3
"Rashid/Holder should have come in place of Kanos. As much as I like Kanos, today wasn't the right situation to send him at no. 4",10
Have you heard of the tragedy of Delhi Capitals?,6
Budhiman Saha. Khelo dimag se,8
"With Rahane in the team and Pant out of form, ain't no way we chasing this shit. Lmao",4
We couldn't even chase 170 lmao. SRH are 50 over that,1
How often do you see Rabada as the most expensive?,3
"At the start, SRH would have easily taken 220, but halfway through they looked set for more",6
Deshpande bowling 18th over sums up DCs bowling today,4
"All the idiots posting ""Williamson fans hating Pandey"" etc, see when those comments are posted. Most of those comments were when Pandey was 19(19) or something.",3
"All you Pandey haters, we saw how hard Koach and ABD found it to accelerate on this pitch... 44 of 31 is not bad by any means

This sub is so fucking radical and wants every player to be a Pollard",8
Heytmyer need to bat @3 instead of Iyer,6
"I mean, can we give some credit to DC's bowling in the last 5...",5
So the equation is 2 boundaries an over of anyone not called Rashid.,4
"220 is a mountain to climb when you have 4 overs of Rashid to handle.  
Sunrisers will have to shit the bed completely. Like absolutely cause an avalanche of shit to cascade throughout every room in the house to lose this.  
  
Also, word for Saha. Really underrated throughout his career. In any era without Dhoni, he'd have a lot more India appearances",23
"The way Saha played today, he is on something :) definitely not MSD though",3
Kanos 💔💔,3
Idk why but I'm hopeful about our chances to chase this down.,5
Even a 65(35) type inning would suffice for Pant today.,3
Imagine if DC lose all their remaining matches and get knocked out,2
"Williamson did not play 31 balls neither 18 balls to get settle. And he was also giving strike to Pandey in beginning. Lol. 

Manish pandey apologist trying to frame Williamson here . Ignoring what happened in match",-7
Ok. Which one y'all jinxed DC's bowling?,3
Don’t worry Iyer the dew will help,1
Where are the Pandey haters now?!?!?!,1
Sometimes I feel even Pandey is confused about whether he needs to play defensively or aggressive. I mean guy can smash the ball but on most occasions goes into a shell and builds pressure on him and others. I guess aggressive Pandey should be the way forward for him.,3
Dc aren't good chasers imo. I feel like the pressure of 220 is going to crack them. Especially if Dhawan doesn't fire,4
Rabada and Nortje were always going to finish well. It was that good Stoinis over that kept the game alive.,9
"In retrospect now, Samad or Holder should've come in for Williamson",9
Good guy kane helping dc by scoring at <100,5
I think varying pace is the way here and Delhi just figured it out late. That's a big reason for the slow rate in last five,8
Iyer in post match interview: Rabada leaked runs today,17
[deleted],2
True INTENT,0
Six points separating all 8 teams. That's quite close right? Or has there been a closer table?,10
I want them to not take it deep like the KKR match and keep smashing regularly. There is no room for taking 30 balls to make fuck all like Iyer and Pant did that game.,2
People here commenting as if 219 is a disappointment. Sure they slowed down but it's still the highest score on this ground by 13 runs IIRC. Good going SRH.,8
"Is Bairstow injured? 
Looks like Saha played a blinder.",8
"Curious to see how Iyer plays today. Far too often in the past he's gotten away with slow knocks citing the ""anchor"" excuse. I'm not expecting him to score a 100, I just want him to play with intent. Barring Sharjah vs KKR, he's showed no intent in any game. 

Today there is no bs about anchoring, especially with Rahane being one of the top three batsmen.",5
"/r/cricket is actually surprised that Manish Pandey can't change his gears. And he's going Australia as our death over specialist in LoI. 

God save India.",3
"I see Mumbai fans finding some solace in us getting a beating when they have just gotten belted by Stokes and Samson. Understandable, have a great day.",1
"That was a pretty decent closing from SRH ngl.

11-20: 107/1 with no powerplay",10
"Our bois did good 

Proud of them scoring 219 at the biggest ground of the tournament",13
Open with Pant you cowards,4
sometimes this sub has such a big hate boner for indian players for idk whatever reasons... some are trolling Pandey after playing with a SR of 142 whereas i haven’t properly seen even few trolling Williamson,12
Pant redemption arc today?,3
Pant gonna carry Delhi alone today to shit on the Indian selectors,2
"So top 3 teams have clearly visible weak points now 

MI : Have problems with defending scores

DC : No plan B when bowlers are under the pump

RCB : No real boundary scorers in the middle overs",9
219 is a good score ffs,7
25 matches in a row for atleast one wicket ..streaks ends today for rabada? is this a record?,5
DC's bowling has suddenly become poor; at such a crucial stage of the tournament. They are giving away lot of runs in the past 3-4 matches.,6
Warner hunting Rabada for 22 was my highlight. Smashed 5 boundaries in 1 over.,13
 Does anyone have any idea why Abdul Samad is getting so many chances? Its nice to pay so much faith in an 18 year old but he hasn't performed even once.,5
The sweet sounds off Saha's bat is why I love cricket!,6
Where was this batting display against Kings XI? I think they batted to make up for the innings they missed in the last match,5
No way is Delhi chasing that total with pant being absolute shite,3
Kondlanna will be so happy with this effort today,1
"Is it the same pitch used for RCB Vs CSK match??
Or different one?",5

Ootl whats with Marlon Samuel's controversy?,1
C'mon Pant. Plis.,3
Pant has to open today no questions asked. Cannot have rahane making 8 off 10,12
Srh has 7 bowling options today,3
"DC, like MI peaked too early in the tournament  imo",12
Pandey is India’s no. 5 / no. 6! Doesn’t make any sense. He will play tuk tuk at the end in the WC ?,5
219 + GST is like 275. Calm down guys.,31
"DC looses this one and then next two games against MI and RCB..... Dc are in real trouble... started the tournament with a bang and are now finding themselves in trouble.

This is why IPL is unpredictable",11
"SRH bowling is kind of CSK, there bowler will easily be able to take pace of the bowl considering most of them bowl around 130's. No way DC can win this game, they didn't learned from RCB's mistake on this pitch. Their batting line up isn't capable of chasing 170+ score that's a first thing second thing chasing on this pitch. Huge huge mistake by taking bowling first.",-2
Don't see how Delhi chase this down with 4 overs of an in form rashid,5
I want Delhi to lose by a run but Pant score 180. Got to keep the competition spicy but simultaneously shit on the selectors,13
I missed SRHs batting. Should've watched the game instead of playing fifa ffs,14
"I don't see Capitals getting more than 180 on this pitch.

That was some unreal batting from Saha and Warner .",6
The purple and orange cap graphics as part of the scorecards are so ugly jfc,17
Who is making Saha's apology thread now? r/cricket,2

They need to give Hetmyer a chance to influence the match by sending him early if Pant is being shit since his come back.,4

Jonny Bairstow IPL career ended?,2
Bruh we gave away 5wickets to Varun. Can't even imagine what we'll do against Rashid now. Rahane opening already giving me PTSD,0
"People defending Pandey, yes he ended up with better numbers than Kane today. He was 11 off 10 at one point too though.

Criticism for Pandey didn't surface overnight. He has under-performed for the last 3 years for SRH. His career strike rate in IPL  is 120 which is not good enough for a specialist batsman.",4
"Dhawan scoring well cos he knows SRH's attack or

SRH bowling to get Dhawan cheaply cos they know his areas?",6
"One things for sure, DC can't afford to play out Rashid like everyone else has. Should be fun to watch if they do go after him",7
"Rabada got taken for 0-54, that's gotta sting.",6
"If DC lose tonight, they'll be doing a reverse KXIP.",5
Kane should play at 3 or  don't play him,8
So why isnt YJB playing?,1
"Open with Pant, you cowards",7
Srh would have had legitimate playoff chances if bhuvi and Mitch marsh did not get injured,8
"This situation is tailor-made for Pant. Not just because of how he bats, but because it's a chance to have a permanent meme - the one day they let Saha out, he tried to make his case for T20, but Pant came in and made it better. Given the timing right after team selection for the Aus tour, if Pant wins this game, that will never die down.",3
I don't what Abdul Samad has done for him to be included in the playing 11 every single game.,4
"Pant is gonna be key, he's looked the most comfortable against Rashid among the DC batsmen over the years. I want him to score big but still want DC to lose.",1
"This is a very tough target, but I have faith in the boys.",8

A lot of Delhi fans were getting way too cocky after a 6-1 w/l record in first half of tournament. It was gonna comeback to bite them at some point of time.,6
Pace off the ball is key. Best of luck to SRH.,3
If they've dropped Shaw and not giving him rest it's downright braindead. Rahane the same guy who lost Indian 2016 wt20 on his OWN.,2
[DC reminds me of this meme 🤣 ](https://i.imgur.com/rWy5mKH.png),9
Delhi Daredevils are back,8
Why don’t they show a player comparison table between competing teams based of batsmen’s strike rates?,1
Rahane to get out with a top edge. Just a prediction.,2
"For all the anti-batriachy hivemind in reddit, almost no one gives credit to the bowler when they pull it back. Can't expect a batsman to hit everything out the park. The 16th over by Axar was perfect, followed Pandey, varied his pace and kept the over under wraps. Pandey who still has a sr of over 140 is being Tuk-Tuk memed. We just have a hate boner in general. There's almost zero appreciation for anyone.",18
Only hope for Delhi is Pant who has tonked Rashid before as well.,8
Can't they use Bairstow as the substitute keeper?,7
that paragon ad is the lowest effort crap,3
If Samad can prove to be a finisher it would make SRH stronger. They seriously lack in that department,3
"Shreevats Goswami to replace Wriddhiman Saha as the substitute wicketkeeper. Saha is tired & dehydrated, and hence is not in a condition to keep.",7
How much would Deli have to lose by for their NRR to become negative it's at 0.434 right now.,4
In b4 Rahane 60(30),5
Looks like Goswami will be keeping,3
Holder towering over everyone in the huddle lmao,5
This is a first for me. Injured wicketkeeper subbed.,3

Holder is a fuckin giant,11
I have stayed here enough that i now know a couple of people here like edghynihilist and someone with animegirl pfp,5
For a second I was like why tf is Ryan Giggs in SRH. Realized it was Goswami,7
Inb4 DC 44/2 after power play,6
"Yo wtf, holder looks like a giant standing at the huddle",9
I wonder if Jason holder sleeps diagonally when travelling,10
"Why is Rahane opening, WHY?",4
"**Sreevats Goswami is going to keep wicket**

Hot take : Stoinis bowling his full quota would go better than Tushar Deshpande,3
"Rabada will kill Warner everywhere unless it’s an absolute shit pitch.

Now go on guys, prove me right!",-1
Tiny goswami next to holder,3
Should we open with stoinis? No way Rahane is doing it. Might as well take a chance on someone who open usually.,1
Ok guys ditching first 10overs to go back to studies,5
"Interestingly Sanga said, captain would want to bowl first in the pitch report. Man this chase gonna be epic

&#x200B;

>The pitches have started to slow down when you compare the initial games  with the ones held few days ago. Batsmen have tried improvising by  batting outside their crease and moving around a bit. Bowlers need to  vary their pace and hitting the right lengths. Captains will want to  chase and put pressure on the team batting first. Once a score is known,  they can then pace their innings accordingly."" reckons **Kumar Sangakkara**",3
"Shreevats Goswami to replace Wriddhiman Saha as the substitute wicketkeeper. **Saha is injured, not tired or dehydrated.**",8
I feel cricket is one of the rare physical games where anyone can succeed irrespective of their height. Someone like Jason Holder is about average height for a basketball player.,5
Reckon Dhawan feels bad seeing Warner laugh and flirt with Saha?,8
What happened to Saha?,2
"Pointing doing the ""stress eating"" routine!!",2
"Why does the OP, a bot, have an RCB flair? 

Bot conspiracy at play here",9
Uhh Rahane is so shit why'd you have him over shaw,2
Why didn’t they sub in bairstow instead ?,4
Ricky Ponting sneaking in the sandwich before play starts,5

Rahane will be DC' Saha.,5
For those who don’t know that’s shrevats Goswami. The very first emerging player award winner.,4
Lmao holder towering over his teammates. Looks like everyone else is taking a knee,2
Why are Pan Parag and Rajnigandha ads always showing how classy it is to eat pan masala 😂,6
MyTeam11 has got to be the most uncreative name for any kind of app ever created.,1
Is Shaw injured or benched?,1
Shreevats Goswami: Now this name I haven't heard in years.,1

Finally Manish Pandey found a place in ODI side,1
"Hope you get better Saha, your inclusion has already been more than justified",2
Can substitute keep wickets?,3
Rabada's 26 match streak started with SRH at 59/0 and ended with SRH at 54/0,9
Saha got weighed down by his massive balls and is taking a rest before he wrecks the next team,8
If Sreevats can keep why not Johnny?,6
remember when kxip scored 223 vs RR nd still lost?,6
[deleted],7
I miss Shikhar Dhawan iconic mustache,2
Jinx wishing Warner a happy birthday and saying pls spare me today,1
Gotta feel for Pant though. If your coach singles you out then obviously you'll be demotivated. Shastri essentially did to Risabh Pant what Dinesh Karthik did to Kuldeep.,7
People pointing out that Holder looks like a giant. In before this simple admiration becomes blatant racist and pretty horrifying remark in a few years of time.,3
Who's the WK for SRH?,0
Was t Goswami the best player in that 2008 U19 Team?,3
[deleted],4
I have a feeling Rahane will prove haters wrong today,8
"After the greatest innings of all time 15 runs in 29 ball. I will never like this guy

They selected him just for this inning.",1
Rahane shouldn't be the one playing powerplays when you're chasing 220.,8
Is this SRH's highest score? I am not pretty sure about that,2
121 and 127 strike rate striking fear in the opposition bowlers,6

solid start to day 1 from Rahane,10

Fun fact: Shreevats Goswami was the WK who stumped Kane off Kohli's wide ball in the 2008 WC semifinal.,14
Send Pant to open. You cowards,3
Ideal situation for us. Tuk tuk rahane to eat up all the balls in power play.,8
"Yay! We did it, reddit! We memed Rabada into poor form!",12
Inb4 Rahane scores a century,9
Rahane score more runs than balls played for once!,5

Bruh.,1
good call from punter this,3
Sandeep Sharma's swinging the ball all of a sudden,1
Oh yikes that's a big wicket,3
Either Lose by 100 runs or Chase this shit.,11
"Makes sense, they want to take advantage of pp",3
If DC has to win pant will need to play a big innings,2
Has GMR already taken over Delhi management?,3
DHAWAN gone😳😔,2
Bhen ki chut is saal bhi qualify nahi kar paaye toh laanat hai bhenchod.,5
Is delhi actually going to choke and finish 5th this Ipl?,6
Dc should go beserk now,3
Will Saha be fine again for the next match? Anyone knows about how serious is Saha's injury?,2
Stoinis is a pretty good top-order batsman. Let's see how this move plays out...,5
Stoinis should have opened all tournament but we are moving closer,3
"Before Match Warner be like: Fuck birthday gifts, I'll myself gift a win for me today.",9
Stoinis has a pretty good record opening in T20 so he'll feel right at home rn,4
"Delhi obviously have to sacrifice an opener every innings

May as well play Shaw as the sacrificial lamb so Dhawan can score runs",6
This has been a never ending nightmare so far. Why am I still a fan damn it,5
Definitely expected that in swinger.,1
BEAUTY,1
"If Rahane is giving a catch to anyone early on, I hope its Vijay Shankar. Vijay is the only guy in ipl with enough 3D abilities to know that he should probably drop the catch to give his team an advantage.",6

"If you wanted to capitalize in the powerplay, you shouldn't have opened with Rahane

But then again, in a chase of 220 where will he play",8
Need that 140 something bbl innings pls,3
Nobody expects the Stoinis Inquisition!,5
How can sreevats keep ?,1
STOINIS FTW,2
So much action in the first over,2
"Sreevats Goswami latest one to feature from the class of 2007 in this IPL, albeit as a substitute, after Kohli, Jaddu, Pandey, Kaul and Tiwary. I guess No U-19 squad has given this many IPL regulars.",6
I mean are people really hoping for DC to chase this down? I am just hoping they dont lose big and take a big dip on the NRR,3
Why there is no sponsor for 4s?,7
Guess I'll not be Da.one this time,5
"Stoinis 'opening'

We BBL now, lads",4
Sandeep has more wickets than Bumrah with similar economy with  1 less match,8
200 more of those please lmao,2
That was a shit shot. Playing against the swing. Dhawan really can’t play the moving ball,1
Can y'all get out at 100 mark please? I want to feel the warmth of top 2 for at least a day,8
Sunrisers Hurtrabad with the amount of injuries,6

why doesnt rcb use a sub wk like srh is doing here,1
"Chewing gum: exists
 
Australian cricketers: I'll take your entire stock",52
Pretty rubbish shot by Dhawan first up to be honest.,6
Warner's smile is actually his frustration and anger which he is hiding.,7
"As a csk fan , feel good to see dhawan get out in the first catch (no offense to dc)",12
"My half depressed side seeing first  half of the game ask other half to cheer up after seeing Stoinis  first ball four.  


edit: My other half is also depressed now.",8

i thought stoinis was an up and comer but he's 31 already! time to fulfill potential lol,8
Rooting for RCB this year. Please kick DC out in your next game,4
Just a reminder of that Rahane 40(35) innings,5
"M going to have some strong words with pointing after the match and it's not going to be soft!!

Smart move to bring Nadeem. Only opportunity when you have two rights...,2
DC opener's have had 4 golden ducks in the last 4 matches lol,6
Rahane has more than run a ball!!,3
Brian Lara has a crystal ball,4
Was there a clause in that trade we did with SRH for Dhawan that we're never ever allowed to beat them as long as Dhawan plays for us?,5
So we bringing Rahane back to form?,5
WE GONNA WIN THIS,1
"I forgot that we have 3D as well , i feel like he'll go for runs but take a wicket off a full toss",4

Virat Kohli in that ad looks like Fawad Khan from Humsafar. The bgm is adding to it.,0
200 is a big thing for SRH. Only on few occasions they have crossed that. If they don't win today then I don't have any words to say.,8
Crowd chanting KKR ????,4
I don't mind losing..but give it a fight.. don't care for NRR.. show some guts.,7
Anyone know why Delhi are still sticking with Tushar? Mohit and Harshal in reserve might be slower but atleast have variations especially Mohit.,5

Hoping for Hampshire's very own Ajinkya Rahane to pull off a special innings today,3
Whos keeping? Doesn't look like bairstow,3
Either Delhi is gonna chase this down or SRH will defend it.,17
Problem of Starting a run chase of required rate of 11 is that even a good over of 9-10 runs will increase the RRR,3
Rahane won't reach 15,-5
"If sunrisers get rahane, dc's chances of winning double",3
"Rahane was exiled from RR because management told him, Unadkat and Kulkarni that the team isn't big enough for three Rahanes.",9

Well atleast I'm getting fantasy points from Warner's catches :),2

Yeah boi. Rahane and Pant are going to do it. (/s?),4
DC should play for NRR now,6
It's like they don't want to win at all!!!,1

Should've sent Iyer not Hetmyer. He's more suited to collapse stopping.,4
"You guys just wait and watch, Rahane will chase 220 before sunday",2
DC go big or go home,2
"Losing white ball spot, his red ball spot contender Saha doing well, now dropped to number 6.  Last 24 hours haven't been good for Pant.",7
Let's go Hetty.,0
Inb4 140*(69) by Rahane wins it for DC,2
Two experiments one after the other?,3
One more wicket and I think pant comes out. Looks like they're sending their finishers first to be explosive,3
Send Pant ffs,1
“Gets the big man” Points to his crotch😂,-1
So Delhi have chosen death by  NRR today .,7
Guys who is the girl in thumka laga challenge or whatever?,0
Ponting forgot to give Stoin his spring bat,2
Hetmyer?? Looks like DC is over complicating the chase.,3
"Reminder that after losing this match, dc will be on 14 points and punjab 12 with probably better nrr",4
"Honestly though, these weird batting order experiments by most teams are quite shocking.",7
"Prithvi Shaw starts the season well, but fails horribly afterwards, meanwhile Dhawan couldn't convert his decent starts. Rahane comes into team and Dhawan starts cunting the bowlers all around the park. Shaw gets dropped and Rahane is promoted to open the innings. Now, Rahane has to prove himself while Dhawan gets out for duck.

*Delhi Capitals openers conundrum*",17
"Good night lads, that's it for the day!",7
at least shaw can play shots,1
"I knew this chase was killed when the best in form batsman got out at 0, we're dead an there goes our top 2 spot. Abysmal this from Delhi",1
"What is going on. Im going to be heartbroken if we don't qualify, I don't even know if we deserve to after the last 2 games.",2
Rahane is really worrying me because for me Tests are all important and Rahane looks a shadow of the player he was in 2014. I hope its just a temp loss of form.,3
One tremendous reduction in NRR . Please and Thank you,7
"Who do sunrisers need to buy to improve the squad. I think bowling is good, we need a finisher and a reliable Indian middle order batsmen",5
"If Delhi loses, which they will, tomorrow's match is going to determine who goes on top of the table.",6
Imagine all the celebration explosion if Warner and Kohli played together.,13
Really soft shot by Stoinis. Could have easily gotten a boundary if he had gotten elevation.,5
Stoinis: Eject!! Eject!!,5
Bruh SRH have to beat MI and RCB after this...,9
Man if SRH wins heavy they are gonna be a serious problem in the table,5
Is Iyer trying to be the new Thala Dhoni,5
Classic 14(6) from Hetmeyer coming,3
"Me after work:

&#x200B;

1. Check score update
2. Check scorecard to see who fucked us up. 
3. Oh, all the batsmen fucked us up.",6
So all top teams are struggling in second half.,4
Is this the most one-sided stomp of this IPL?,3
It feels stupid fucking with the batting lineup this much right now,4
Shtreyas Iyer should come in and bat right now not Hetmyer.,4
What will DC do? SRH hasn't even unleashed their teenage spin overlord yet,5
[deleted],10
"Rahane please hit the ball aerially it is a 220 run chase, sincerely a dc fan",9
Delhi got REALLLY lucky with that short run or they would have been struggling bad with this form and schedule AND with 12 points.,11
DELHI COLLAPSITALS,5
Do you guys think Sandeep Sharma can be a good test cricketer?,1
Sandeep sharma is a handful in first 3 overs,3
Hetmyer finally getting a good amount of overs to bat,1
Wheres the DC sadness thread I need to cry,9
Shaw must be enjoying this,1
Sandeep Sharma has the longest runup for someone bowling 125ks,8
"Strange to say this about an IPL centurion but Rahane is barely a T20 batsman nowadays. Starts slow, lacks the power game. Was Rajasthan's captain but he was such a liability with the bat that they weren't sad to lose him.  
Tremendous fall for him",0
"Would have been better if they sent out Axar after first wicket. Hetmyer has been shit through out the season, except one match. Not sure why he is in the team anyway.",-1
Rahane redemption arc?,2
"Wait, who is the wk right now?",2
Can Srh still make it to the playoffs?,3
Hetmeyer's butt is capable of holding the lift by itself,5
"Honestly feel good for warner , must have felt shit after the collapse last game after giving a headstart",8
I feel like all of this is a giant setup for KXIP to win the IPL,9
It's already over isn't it?,3
"This outfield is super fast, don't fuck up the pp ffs",0
Rahane is just ruining his test performance to become T20 player.,1
DD's NRR is going to get absolutely raped today,7
Rahane back at run a ball!,2
Warner hasn't celebrated this hard since he first saw his cardoons on oled.,7
Looks like DC wants some runs on the board by the end of the powerplay with Rahane at one end!,2
Wont get within 50 runs of this total,2
They haven’t even unleashed Rashid yet and collapse already happening. Big rip DC see u next season,2
I don't think SRH will mind Rahane being in the crease tbh.,2
"Why DC is playing Rahane, Shaw was fine and didn't play tuktuk",4
Not Rahane 3D,0
Why have dc dropped shaw? On his good day he can alone win them matches unlike rahane,2
That tweet about short run determining  a playoff spot seems like it will come true now lol,5
Vijay Shankar is one of the top fielders in India?,4
Shaw either would have gone guns blazing but wouldnt be crippling this chase like that. Remove Rahane for the sake of T20s,3
Rahane 60(89),2
"Only consolation right now is that either RCB or MI have to lose tomorrow. But that's not gonna help us against KKR, KXIP and RR all on fire right now...",8
Iyer showcasing his inner Thala by holding himself back in a big chase?,7
Not Opening(bowling) with Ferguson and batting with Pant. This IPL can have a dedicated list of weird and shitty decisions(blunders).,1
Ah rahane giving 2016 semis vibes,1
"What’s the reason Sandeep isn’t chosen for T20I squads? IIRC his stats are slight better than Bumrah’s in IPL (not saying he should replace Bumrah obvs, but using Bumrah as a baseline for comparison)",1
Sharma S definitely looks like a guy who can swing quite a lot both ways,2
"If KXIP and RCB make it to the final, it will be very hard to watch for me",5
"Rahane learn to fookin dive, kid",0
I have a question. Why don't players have hand injuries when they catch a fast moving ball?,2
150-160 total for DC,5
"Vijay Shankar - Top fielder in India 

Really ?",5
Hope Rayudu ain’t watching the game today or right how. Mark Nicholls is healing praise on Shankar for his fielding.,8
Scenes if Ajju scores a century and takes DC home,6
DC all out 117 u hear it first here,5
"Rahane in IPL 2020 so far:

15(15)

2(9)

8(10)

0(1)

Sure, Shaw has been disappointing in the last few matches, but what exactly has Rahane done to replace the guy who has won two games for his team this season?",7
[Prediction. Just switch Rahane and Dhawan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jizuot/match_thread_47th_match_sunrisers_hyderabad_v/gaa4bn0?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),3

SRH agent Rahane is performing well,3
oooh....look at that 3d fielding!!,5
Intent kaha hai bsdk,7
I can only accept dc win if pant scores 100 off 35. /s,4
It feels like today is Rishab Pant’s day to score big as a reply to his exclusion from t20 side...,0
Last season it was SRH vs RCB (RCB's last match) and I remember Hetmyer  smashing Rashid to all parts. DC will need that if they are to win today.,2
We have only lost 2 to the new ball so far!,11
"If this total get chased dowm, Delhi deserves to win the title",6
Should I be happy or sad? Both are my top fav. teams...,2
Where the fuck is Shaw?,0
unfortunately Rahane is not a player for such high intensity runchases,7
There's a DC Downvoter among us,11
"Going by the look and pace , Sandeep seems like he'll get smashed every second ball. Gives me *even I will smash him* feels.

 But he's really good. Swings the ball well and is pretty tight with lines. Looks can indeed be misleading",1
Is holder taller than 2 shaws stacked one on top of the other?,9
Who's keeping wickets for SRH,3
Inb4 Hetmyer/Pant plays a match winning knock.......am I being dangerously optimistic?,1
This match is all about Quantum of Defeat ^(TM) for Delhi now. And their keeper don't know how to play for that.,3
"Delhi needs to go for NRR. 

Otherwise if they lose to MI and RCB, they might regret it.",2
Rahane will end with a solid 28 (25).,3
Gaandu Hetmyer tujhe defend karne nhi bheja,10
"RCB happy noises

I will bite my words when Srh will qualify in place of  RCB",8
Pant 100 pls.,7
"Shaw shouldve played this

This has been soo boring",9
Shaw would've been on 40(10)* or 0(1) now,9
ARE WE CHASING 127?,9
"2 overs in and the match becomes a lost cause. I hope MI and RCB beat them too. I'm all in for 5-way battle for 2 places. With all the talk about intent this season, It would be apt to settle things by NRR lmao.",4
"You either die as Capitals, or you live long enough to see yourself become the Daredevils!!",15
"Rahane is absolutely going to end up as the highest run scorer for DC today, isn’t he?",4
I usually sleep at like four in the morning but this match is putting me to sleep at 9:30pm wow,2
Please hitmyer,5
The difference with which Warner and Shreyas approach their role of captaincy is the key distinguisher here.,5
Jason Holder is poor man's Darren Sammy in T20's. He is  like Sobers in Tests,4
Inb4 commentators admire how tall Jason Holder is,7
This sucks,3
"They are chasing 220, not 120",3
😂😂😆🤣🤣😆😆😆🤣😂,0
"Apparently Mark Wood was Mumbai's first choice as Malinga's replacement but Wood turned them down and they turned to Pattinson. Imagine Bumrah, Boult and Wood as your pace bowling lineup.",3
Altroz feels pretty lonely out there.,1
No one told Hetmyer how many are needed?,3
Vijay Shankar 3d fielding excellent.,3
"I was like DC still could do it. Then I see Rashid ... Nvm guys sorry, you can go sleep",2
Pant has been tailor made for this situation and you send Rahane who is anti this run chase. Idk what are they smoking,1
DC being DC.. Frustrating to see this team consistently perform badly in second half of season.,2
"I have this stereotype against WI and ENG players that they can’t play spin well. It’s true to a certain extent too. 

So I was wondering if bringing in Nadeem against Hetmyer would be better. But then Holder has been phenomenal in the PP and nails his yorkers.",1
Scenes if SRH choke from 108 needed off 18,6
Hopefully Delhi realise Shaw > Rahane in T20s & for team balance,4
Why disrupt the batting order like this? Don't think that good captaincy.,3
Can't believe we're fucking up the powerplay this bad,2
Ho kya raha hai bhai :(,2

"Sorry fellow bhenchods, I don't have any confidence in these bhenchods left except pant to win this.",4
TBH Rahane's kind of batting is suited mostly for limited overs. He can play an anchors role while others can strike but not sure whether he can win you matches by staying till the end. Not seen him do that in T20's.,0
Shot.. to the fielder lol,5
Rahane literally 10/10 in a 220 chase,2
"3 international captains in field for SRH. Is Nabi captain as well?

Edit: 4",11
"What I have loved about Smith and Rajasthan this is that, whenever they've been chasing big targets, he's had this, ""I don't give a fuck if we lose. Me and my lads are gonna try and cunt the bowling as long as we're alive"" attitude.",6
"4 overs, 24/2

4 full overs of Rashid to go",4
How much could DC lose the nrr today?,1
There seems to be a fielder everywhere. Good captaining from warner,6

Holder was trying to swing throw the ball,3

"Wtf are we waiting for, rashid to come in lol",9
"Delhi fans, what happened today ?",8
Thiccmeyer will try hard and lose his wicket.,4
Now DC knows what RR supporters felt.,7

dc will end with 164/6 probably,8
RCB fans: haha yes die trash,9
"Why is Rahane getting so much attention instead of guys like SKY, etc. Hoping that this ages like milk.",3

"I know earlier I said the opposition wouldn’t give Rashid “respect,” but I didn’t mean swing hard at the very first bowl ffs!",3
"Srh fans jinx alot, there is already ajinx batting",7
"**6.1** Rashid Khan to Hetmyer, OUT, **clips off stump first ball!** Good length, a slider starting from just outside off stump. It's a regulation legbreak. Hetmyer backs away and looks to drive through the covers with all stumps exposed. It marginally gets the outside edge of the off stump **54-3**

SO Hetmyer  b Rashid Khan 16 (13b 3x4 0x6) SR: 123.07",2
Yeesss!! Pantsy,2
DC was DD in disguise all this time.,2
Pant will be miffed that he is dropped from the ODI and T20 teams. Pissed pant = dangerous Pant. And they have a match against Koach's RCB. Not looking for RCB!!!,3
"Aakash Chopra just said ""jaa Shimron jaa, pavilion ki taraf"".....",12
Arey yaar bhenchod ek toh pollution ne gaand le rakhi hai. Ek hi cheez achhi ho rahi thi Delhi ke liye usme bhi bhenchod haar rahe hai,4
Rashid hands down the greatest T20 spinner ever. And he's only 22.,2
Rashid is Donald J Trump card for SRH,5
Fat bigg ass replaces another... pant ffs get fit please,3
"That was  rather unfortunate, it would have been umpire's call if it were a lbw call(DRS) but it's not how it works outside the realm of DRS reviews.",2

Isn't he generally very good vs spin?",7

Ipl do your thing",1
Where is that guy who was saying let's see what he will do if they don't respect Rashid,12
The palyoff race is shaping up to be an all-time battle. Mumbai might be safe because of the crazy good net run rate.,0
Wonder why Iyer isn't there yet....he usually comes at 3 for DC right,3
Lmao.. iyer doesn't wants to bat tonight,2
"I relate to Sanjay Banger on a spiritual level, we're both reserved and shy people who come out of their shell and have a quality time because of their amazing friends.",6
I'm calling it.. KXIP is gonna lose 1/2 remaining games and tie with DC on 14 points while DC is gonna get butt fucked for the rest of the tournament go out of playoffs based on NRR,5
SRH got this! Surely?,2
Having rashid in the team is such a confidence booster. Get some sort of total and rashid will take care of the rest,11
Is Rahane an organic compound?,1
Apt batting conditions for Panty to get back in form.,1
Atleast change the script from 2019 IPL Delhi,7

let's see super big hitting of super rishab pant,0
Where is Iyer??,1

Which genius had the idea to let Warner go,6
There always seems to be turn for Rashid! What a bowler!!,4
Hetmyer looks a bit like fat Ronaldo,-4
Iyer at no.6😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,1
What is Iyer doing ?!?!,2
SRH insurance plan bowling!,8
People keep making fun of Rashid's age but if you go to places in Afghanistan they are built like that. They mature very early and have a lot of hormones due to their diet. They start getting beards around 16-17 and just look at rashids fingers they are very big. This is how Pathans or Afgans are in most of the places.,8
Good to see Swanny has passed on the Dugout bully baton to Scott Styris... Absolutely ragging on Dominic Cork after that Rashid wicket,4
"So with 2 games to go, its likely that 1 through 7 will separeted by 6 points. 2 through 7 by 4 points.",2

Rashid best in the world for a reason,4
rahane too beta to review,5
This Rashid Khan over is neutral now. It was positive for srh when Hetmyer got out and it's positive for dc cause rahane got out,6
Rahane too shy to use up a review,3
Will he get a fifer today?,1
Rashid does it 99/100 times,6
"Plumb.

Too good Rashid!",2
Rahane can't play quality spin man. He's so useless. Ffs.,3
Fuck yeah Rashid. R for respect!!,7
"I feel bad for Rahane, he won't be picked by any franchise moving fwd.",7

"RAHANE WILL NEVER USE DRS. Not that he could have been saved here, but his approach is always ""lets save it for the rest"", which is completely against what Kohli or other players think",17
Rahane is the most selfish batsman I've seen,-1
We shouldn't be in playoffs. It won't end well for us so why waste a space.,1
Pant looked clueless as to Rahane asking him if it was or not lol,6
DCollapse,2
Anyone know what DC NRR will be if they are all out under 100?,2
" If Delhi Capitals lose by more than 74 runs, their NRR drops below RCB's.",9
Why do they say IPL is unpredictable when I see the same shit with Delhi every year lol.,8
"See you later BCs

Need to focus on that chubby thing on me TV.",5
How good is Rashid my god,7
Wtf DC. This will throw all run rate scenarios in a dizzy.,4
JSW guy jinxed his own team,6
DC should focus on protecting their NRR.,7
Petition to give Rashid Khan an Indian passport,20
"Lmao and to think Rashid has 3 more overs to get the rest of the wickets, RIP DC",7
Rashid Khan is the second greatest overseas Asian player in the IPL after Malinga. By the end of the career greatest,12
Almost chopped on,2
What the fuck is that Vnext ad? Why does everyone sound like they are having a stroke?,3
Maaro yaar ab kya bacha hai,4

Afganistan should play more test matches. Really want to see Rashid bowl in tests.,16
It's seppuku time,4
Rashid is going a long way,4
Where do we go from here,1
"Trade Rashid to RR,pls.",-1
Wow. DC will have to face 3 more overs of this!,5
A situation like this justifiably calls for playing for nrr Dhoni style. Going for a win might just end up leaving them all out under 100.,9
How do people even people even play against Rashid Khan? What a promising YOUNG lad. Hehe.,7
DC has three more overs of Rashid (•‿•),11
4D chess by shreyas. he knew there would be a collapse so demoted himself to show the value of his tuk-tuk,16
Deshpande and Rahane MUST be dropped.,10
Now it's about how bad of a hit our NRR will take,6
"If srh, rr, kxip & kkr all get to 14 points then either kxip or srh will go through.",4
Rashid took 16 wickets but he didn’t look like he was taking wickets this season.,7
We peaked too early innit,8
Oh lmao I forgot Iyer was yet to bat,11
SRH would never ever release Rashid,24
Thala mode should be activated by now.,6
Rashid has reached peak Narine level in terms of immediate impact..,11
GG boys. Done watching for tonight.,5
"The net run rate disparity is crazy. Mumbai is above 1, the rest are all below 0.5, Delhi is at 0.434 and its going to take a beating after today.",7
"Other than rahane, who are the next potential no.5 batsmen for india in Tests?",3
so just the usual dc batting order with extra steps,4
Bhagwa Bois killin it tonight 🚩,12
"Yeah pant, wasn't chirpy while keeping today. No goofy grins while batting as well?",4
Khan.. Rashid Khan..,8
Isn't this the first time Rahane has gotten out to Rashid?,7
Yeah u all were asking for Iyyer so DC kept losing wickets till he came out in the middle,9

Punter is gonna take a class of this team when the match is over and the players are NOT going to enjoy it,9
Love you DC. lose by 100 runs plz,17
So after this game srh nrr will be positive with 10 points ?,2
Here comes the pencil bowler,2
"That's why I have respect for mi, after the rcb 201, they never gave up, played with the intent to win and there was one player who took initiative and then joined by another player",0
Top teams getting yeeted by lower teams late in the tournament. Just IPL things.,7
"Delhi won't beat Mumbai. The only teams that have beaten Mumbai this season (minus the CSK game which was an anomaly) have been sides with explosive, top heavy batting lineups. MI generally get rattled when you attack them up front, early on, DC don't have the batsmen to do it. 

Looks like it's gonna be a virtual QF vs RCB to decide playoff qualification then.",9
"Rash saying bhenchod, never seen that",7
DC peaked too early I guess whereas it seems like KXIP has peaked at just the right time.,7
why the fock rishab is not working hard on his fitness escapes my mind?,1

rashid khan is literally a cheat code,3
My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember patterns.,6
MI is in big trouble now. DC and RCB will; come in with a point to prove and SRH if they play like this I really hope MI can win at least one of those three matches.,0
"Deshpande and Rahane are our backups, phew!!",7
"People have been waiting for Rashid to be ""found out""

Don't think that's gonna happen",8

YAAAS PANT SHOW THE SELECTORS,5
Rashid is too OP,2
"Ball fell right over the word ""talent""",7
DC's loss by a big margin doesn't really benefit RCB right? Since SRH's NRR would go past RCB's and they may sneak in.,0
Does anyone have runs and overs for and against detail for NRR calculation? How much would DC and SRH NRR change if DC gets bundled around 120?,6
That beard on Natarajan looks hideous ngl.,6
That shot...... *orgasm*.. that fucking shot...,4

Oooooooh that shot made me feel things,6

RCB fans are having the time of their lives lmfao,17
"Good for other teams that Rashid doesn't play for a team with strong batting line-up 
 
The team would have been too OP then",6
The last time Pant got dropped(WC squad) the oppostion got destroyed. Highly likely today if they don't get him out.,8
who are the next potential no.5 batsmen for india in Tests?,3
"We get the Pant in, we get the Rahane out",0
That shot from Pant was as good it gets,3

Panty Dropping Shot,4
DC to lose but Pant fo fire today pls,6
Someone give this guy a trimmer and the long hair umpire guy a scissors,10
Rashid has been outstanding this season. This might be his best season in the ipl yet. Not a single bad game apart from that Tewatia over. Understated because he hasn't got as many wickets as Rabada. time to catch up in that column now.,9
As a RCBian I want DC to loose the match by atleast 80-100  runs.,9
"Imo Natrajan should go around the wicket to pant, he could completely shut down the leg side",8

DC should start thinking about the quantum of loss stuff at this point. A huge NRR damage would be disastrous for their top 2/top 4 ambitions.,16
Was that some Indian selector on the ground? I can't recall his name,5
How will srh winning tonight have an impact on KXIP??,15
Rashid 2-3 GOD,14
Downvote if your mom a hoe,-11
Rashid making it a 16 over game for DC. If he keeps going it will be hard to even  avoid nrr issue.,26

"They just worked Shankar's over around for singles, they've already given up",3
"I literally said before this innings that DC cannot afford to play out Rashid, but alas, here we are",9
Guys pant has accepted what selectors chose for him and he is just practicing for the test series,10
"If iyer plays 2 or 3 sessions, i am sure delhi can chase this down",2
The towel kinda sus,6
"I think they are indeed playing for NRR. Keeping the *spirit of game* aside, it is actually a good move.",6
Srh is blessed to have rashid bowling for them  and not against them,14
Quantum of Loss time,2
See that? That's why amit Mishra mattered,9
the commentators just said suresh iyer,6
[This did not age well.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jizuot/match_thread_47th_match_sunrisers_hyderabad_v/gaa3jmn?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),5
"Glad it's RCB vs MI, atleast one of them join us with same number of win-loss",3
Fuck the downvoter.,5
"Pant to Rashid in 2018: *Haha rashid go brrr*


Pant to Rashid in 2020: *plz don't dismiss me I'll give you dot balls*",15
Pant is just practising for the Border Gavaskar Trophy now that he is dropped from the T20 side.,2
"If I’m DC, I’d be worried about qualifying now let alone top 2",10
Imagine Warner in CSK wiping the ball with a yellow towel. :P,2
Why is Goswami keeping?,4
'That's a ball' great insight Mark,7
Bc can we really not score more than 2 runs an over against rashid????,4
"Delhi management need to realise that no matter what they have on their jersey, how many youngsters or big name coaches they have, they are not gonna win the cup untill and unless they name themselves ""Delhi Bhenchods"".",5
I defend Iyer many times but aakhir karna kya chaha rahe hai ho,0
Iyer sucks,-1
"Cricviz prediction

SRK 98% 

DC 2%

Looks like a massive NRR boosting win for SRH coming up.",8
6/2 in 3 overs. And DC is looking to chase over 200 :),7
"I don't know why would DC win the toss and decide to bowl first. When your strength is your bowling, why not put some runs on the board and back yourselves to defend it !?! Especially against a generally top heavy batting unit who have struggled in chasing.

Absolutely baffling decision. I think this IPL is going to be won by the team whose management makes the least number of brain-dead decisions and doesn't try to get too smart with their strategies (like RCB, KKR have done in some cases).",3
"Iyer, ""we will bowl first, thanks""

Warner, ""we were looking to bat first to be honest""",10
"dead game now

DC has given up",6
Pant's defence makes me nervous for some reason.,3
"U won't hit Rashid, u won't hit 3d, u won't hit nattu

Who will u hit?",3
Delhi seem to lose terribly when they loose. Seems their weakess is their batting,1
"Wow, they're clearly playing to preserve NRR.",1
Someone remind Pant that he is playing T20 not test and innings like this have caused his removal in T20 AND ODIs,1
I really wanna make a CSK joke here but I cannot because we lost to them 2 days ago.....,4
Time for another name change. Delhi Darecapitals,5
Pant fine tuning his test game here,1
What in InTeNt?,0
"Looks like Nadeem will once again finish with 1 or 2 overs. Every top side has at least one top quality left hander in their lineup. Why pick a left arm spinner who can't bat if he's not going to give you even 3 overs? Shankar has been bowling 3 overs every match anyway, that too cheaply.",-2
"You absolute cunts, just had to find form literally one match after it  mattered",6
Genuinely scared for top 4,2
Ab scored 144 of 44 balls.,4
Iyer can't even time it,2
"'We'll have a bowl, thanks'",5
Iyer looks so lost lol.,2
Robo shankar needs to go for 20 in the next 5 balls . Else game over,1
They need to get all these runs off not 10 but 8 overs. Anything off Rashid is a bonus. Sad but thats the way they have to play.,1
"It's been a few years since I've been this embarrassed by my capitals but here we are.

We're playing like we dont deserve a playoff spot at this rate",1
Srh 50 runs ahead lol,3
Even CSK daddus so more intent than this shit,3
Wow compared to 2018 pant has really gotten thicc,7
"Rashid Khan must be an absolute nightmare to face. Quick arm action, not much difference in action with his variations and very few bad balls.",7
"Rashid has been figured out

Conceded 1, 2, and then 3.

At this rate, three games from now, he will concede 13, 14, 15, and 16. Shit bowler.",17
"Lol, everyone thought Pant was gonna play for revenge after being dropped from national t20 team. Here he is with 16 off 17",5
SRH batsman would had run 3 there,4
"Has anyone else found that with age losses don't affect them as much? When I was younger a loss like this would legitimately make me depressed for a day, but now I literally couldn't care less. Especially since we've been so outclassed.",9
SRH vs RCB. SRH sends in KW to bowl. Kohli decides to hold off Abd for no. 11,14
Ricky Ponting hasn't blinked since the start of this match,6
Srh would have ran a double there,3
Why the hell is Nadeem there to bowl only 1 over?,3
Fuck this shit I'm watching the RTX 3070 reviews. :(,4
Saha will get the MoM right?,3
Why did Ponting experimented with their batting line-up today of all days with this big chase on Dubai ground.,2
"Both batsmen have SR<100. And, don't tell me they are getting their eyes in. They have both played 11+ balls. That's enough time in T20s",3
Lol soft dismissal after a shit innings,4
I think they have already accepted defeat.,4
Lmao I can’t even do anything other than laugh at these incompetent morons.,5
[removed],3
Why is Shaw not playing? I do any he had a few bad games. Is it because of that or is he injured?,1
[deleted],-4
"The only team i can see playing out rashid easily is rcb because of kohli , he'll just take singles 
Rn even if they are going for nrr they should run singles",5
"Not only u didn't hit 3d, u gave him a wicket

Slow balls FTW",2
Play for nrr lol,1
Ponting's defo whipping out the cricket bat for Iyer rn,6
"Shankar the economical gun bowler, for the 3rd match in a row. 2020 at it again",0

SRH playing at Sharjah and DC at Dubai huh?,1
3D!!!,0
Thala Iyer,5
3D,2
Another one bites the dust,3
Why is Rishab 400 Strike Rate not showing intent™?,2
They need to thrash Shankar out of the park this over.,1
Viju picks a wicket 👌,1
"3D getting into wickets, Rayudu downing another bottle",3
"Lol.. shit innings again by Iyer, how the fuck he keeps getting selected in Indian team is beyond me.. Pant is anyday a better batsman than Iyer.",0
Iyer with a 7(12) masterclass in a chase of 220. Sigh.,4
How do we go from playing like Delhi Daredevils to peak CSK in the course of 2 games,6
What a captains knock Shreyas,3
Lmao Srh were at 136/1,4
3D boy does magic here.,2
SRH is honestly the worst team to face if they put up a total that's even slightly above par,5
RCB/MI lost when DC lost last week so MI/RCB should forfeit their next match to support the bro code,7
One Number 4 player for India takes another Number 4’s wicket,1
Delhi's nrr gonna get absolutely smashed tonight bois,1
Wtf,1
b Shankar annaa c kane kaka,4
surprising how good field placements can save a team three runs,5
"As a neutral fan, I think Vijay Shankar gets unnecessary trolling. He is a good batsman, decent bowler and better than average fielder. Might not win you matches single handedly but helps in setting up the team balance. Due to some selector's poor choice of words on 3D or 4D, he is mercilessly trolled. He is 1000 thousand times better than rayudu.",27
"Bruhh khaleel is still""emerging"" player",6
Ricky Ponting coming in then?,5
Iyer as a T20 batsman is overrated,1
"Dhoni to DC fans : You tried to mocked my methods. look where that brought you 






back to me",2
Shankar Anna bowling like Mcgrath in the UAE,2
What a turnaround for SRH. Exciting bunch of folks,3
Yea Iyer ahead of Sky makes sense...,2
"List of Shankar’s victims: Faf du Plessis, Jos Buttler, Shreyas Iyer.",9
Whole team out of form at once. Lol,6
Conspiracy against Pant,2
3D back on top lads,4
"Hopefully iyer's last season at delhi, I've seen the light. Not good enough as a t20 batsman, and easily the worst captain at the tournament",2
"**11.3** Shankar to Iyer, OUT,  **78-5**

SS Iyer c Williamson b Shankar 7 (12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 58.33",3
"Friendship ended with DC, now RCB is my best friend",11
Shankar the bowler has been top class this IPL,2
"Iyer can't play freely under pressure 

Iyer can't play freely when there's no pressure 

Iyer can't finish matches after getting off to starts 

Iyer can't get off the blocks quickly 

Iyer can't counterattack 

India's No.4 in T20s, guys.",13
Did anyone actually say Rashid Khan's been figured out?,7
Singh fam where u at,2
Cricinfo:  **DC need to get to 146** to stay ahead of RCB,7
Iyer is the worst IPL captain in the history of all IPL,5
What happened to Iyer and Pant. Really disappointing to see their playing like this.,2
Bc shitiest innings of the highest order.,5
Will we drop our captain now?,2
"Shrey-ass ire is desperately out of form, he got 3-D's so hard",1
Scenes when 3D plays no4 for India again,4
Great revenge by VJ shankar for DC snubbing him. You never doubt class,1
ah we're back to daredevils mode i see,3
Iyer is a liability on the team. He very rarely is able to score freely whether the team needs it or not,2
Fuccboi Axar gonna pull a Tewatia here,2
"Vijay Shankar should have been called for Aus tour, as Hardik doesn't bowl much. Could have used a pace all rounder.",2
Stoinis should have bowled 4 overs,1
[removed],5
"Pant, really needs to work on his fitness, Gayle is running faster than him between the wickets and he is 41 years old.",7
Lol we're not that good as the points table suggests. That's why I was mad after that Chennai game. We just got lucky. Iyers captaincy and batting both are dreadful.,4
">142 from 51

Damn! This is gonn be a good chase",2
I'm now watching this match just for the nostalgia,7
Delhi doing the reverse kings 11 in the second half. But only difference being that kings 11 were atleast entertaining when they lost.,6
DC whole vibe got wrecked in 1st innings,1
We are a weird and most unpredictable team.,3
"Shaw played a huge fucking role in those 2 victories, he gave that momentum which pushed us till there. He is a genuine Aggressive player he is going to be inconsistent",3
Chad 3D Shankar >>>> Virgin Rayudu,6
bachpan yaad aane laga hai wapas... DD ke dinn..,6
DC is getting its NRR fucked,3
Iyer is a confusing talent,6
Is Axar the Saviour out yet?,2
Delhi have sadly (it’s not that sad) lost all steam,6
Iyer is a T20 batsman. Iyer is a T20 batsman. Iyer is a T20 batsman,5
Never had doubts about our our bowling. Was just worried one of the bowlers might go for runs which has happened this season but we have 6th bowler.,3
Wow Delhi. If this is how you are gonna play from now on then you better stay here than qualify for playoffs.,4
This is what u get for senseless Batting order.,4
This is over.,0
bro Iyer fucking sucks... enough said,0
Awwww🙄🙄,2
[deleted],4
Iyer played the most worthless innings I have seen in this match. At least I understood the point with the rest.,1
I thought this was DC's year..,2
Pant needs to play a Thala-esque innings now. 60*(59) or whatever I won't mind it at all,5
Now this is all about protecting the NRR,2
DC are like the popular kids that peaked in high school,11
That's what the good whiskey is for!,3
"RRR 17.0, tf you doin DC",1
"For the love of god, DC please get 146.",1
No Indian player can read Rashid Khan bar Dhawan,6
Why would Iyer not back himself to dig out DC out of the hole and demote himself ? Inexplicable,3
Playing aggressive here is subject to net run rate risk.,3
"DC went from 
-	we will top the table to 
-	we will get top 2 easy to 
-	we will barely qualify",10
Dare I say SRH are like Pakistan? We're consistently unpredictable for some reason at batting and better at bowling,4
"India will probably line up with a middle order of Iyer, Samson and Pandey in t20s. Truly tragic.",4
Iyer cannot survive when attack is coming from 3 dimensions.,11
Injury premier league,5
Axar plz save NRR,1
Suryakumar died for this!,10
"Bruh Delhi's bowling was pretty shit, no slower balls till the fucking 16th over.  Ashwin obsessed with Legspin for some reason smfh",2
Shankar also injured wtf ?????,3
SRH and injuries 😭,4
SOMEBODY THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN!!!,2
Shankar AGAIN injured?! Is this man made of glass,2
Another injury what the flying fuck,2
Bairstow,4
Uh oh,2
Shoutout to bair-reddy,3
Shankar and injuries. - A love story,4
Srh and injuries man,5
Poor Bairstow,6
"3D or Russel, who has a fragile body?",4
What the fuck? Another hamstring injury,7
[deleted],9
"if axar patel and chahal were to arm wrestle, who would win? i say audience",2
"Oh fuckk, not 3D",4
Love DC but this is just embarrassing. Going from dominating table topping team to this ffs cmon,2
Pant show them why you were selected in test squad,3
"Yikes

Vijay Shankar injury",5
Ooh la la. Well good night bois. Gonna have a cry now.,3
3D's hamstring in trouble. Too many injuries,7
Not again Vijay,9
"Ok So, If kkr and kxip Both win 2 of their remaining, So both of them in 16 points.

And DC and rcb loses So they will be Like 13 matches 14 points, So the last match On RCB vs DC will be a knockout match (・∀・)",6
Wtf you can't just casually cut to a kid upset that his team are losing being consoled by his mother,3
Hope tomorrow's match will be very interesting to watch. Don't know what the fuck is this match. Isn't it the right time to accelerate the runs?,3
"Srh fans, why so many injuries??",9
Oh no 3D might have an injury,6
This man is a walking glass,8
3D is really delicate. Be it his legs or fingers!,7
DC batting failed again in a pitch SRH scored 220. Stoinis looked great early on and now looks terrible. Iyer has also blown hot and cold. Pant has barely fired this season and Hetmeyer has not fired this year. Next season they need to add couple of good overseas batsmen. Only Dhawan has played well and he unfortunately failed today.,4
Oh FFS now show us 10 ads play one ball and another 10 ads. Fucking fuckers,6
Oh man! SRH is one cursed team this season.,10
"There is no justification for picking Iyer and Pandey over Suryakumar Yadav. No justification. Not in T20 cricket. 

Today just proved it.",10
SRH injurymania strikes again,8
"This is literally what happened to Bhuvi

Stop giving me PTSD",17
People were praising Iyer for his batting and captaincy. Was even touted for the India captaincy once VK hung up his boots and now people shit on him.,14
Axar has to see jaddu in every srh bowler now,5
Sun Risers Hamstrings,15
We can't chase anything above 125. Who gave Iyer the idea to chase. FFS,2
SRH can't catch a break with all these injuries.,3
"Lord Axar tinkered with space-time, messing up his hamstring",2
why is Vijay Shankar so injury prone?,4
Shankar glass,3
"This is how SRH always have a positive NRR every year. One mandatory match where Warner goes berserk and gets 220 for SRH. And, Rashid comes in and chokes the opposition. They're the real NRR bullies.",8
RIP 3D,3
OMG. What's with SRH and injuries :(,3
WTF are these injuries to SRH man,5
Behnchod 3d how many times you get injured,7
We are terrible at chasing and should always bat first.,2
Bairstow looked like a mom of 2 there ngl,6
"Shankar going for 5.5 RPO is criminal, wtf DC he’s not even a full time bowler",3
"Mitchell Marsh, Bhuvi, Williamson, Saha, Shankar.

Who’s next, Rashid???",9
"Oh no, not 3 D too",5
Fucking hell SRH have been absolutely cursed by injuries,15
Use all your powers and pls win tomorrow RCB,5
Why is indian team obsessed with accumulators?,2
 30 balls ethical 100 incoming,3
CSK fans watching that young boy get the consolation they never got,4
Shankar got injured again. Hard luck SRH. You lost another all rounder.,4
[deleted],0
Imagine having to manage a rrr of 17+ halfway through your innings. Eish Delhi...,6
MC BC DC!!,5
No issues we can try to bowl SRH out for 90 and try to chase it down on day 5,3
"SRH : Yes the team looks perfect and set.
Injuries : Yes.",11
But the end of the ipl we should be able to make an injured XI,7
Why are we so unlucky man? Fuck those injuries.,5
Hamstring Hurters Hyderabad,11
SRH and injuries this season....very unfortunate,5
Khaleel will always find a way to comeback to the line up lmao,11
“The physio and his minions rush into the field”. Lmao cricbuzz wtf,29
If injury substitutes can keep why can't they bowl? Both are equally important,2
How good are Shankar's red ball stats?,3
Somone definitely did vodoo magic against us this year☹️,12
Damn the top 3 hasn't changed since so long.,6
"Warner is no coward, he brought himself on",9
Saha playing T20 and Pant is playing test. What timeline is this?,10
Vijay shankar is too fragile,5
WARNEY BOWLING,3
"Okay, so, what if Shaw is actually our lucky charm?",10
Warner bowl the last ball!!!,6
You know its painful to watch when you need a rrr of 17 in the 12 over,9
Lol David bowling now,4
"Man fuck hamstring injuries. Once you tear it, they keep coming back to haunt you. Had a 13cm tear in my right hammy in 2016 and was never able to fully recover",16
Right arm trash,5
"Warner practicing against rcb

Edit: was expecting legbreak...lol",13
"Get Bairstow on to finish the over

I reckon he can bowl some proper dibbly-dobblies",9
Warner KEKW,10
Not another injury pls,3
Hat-trick incoming,6
Warner taking the piss right now.,8
LMAO he really nearly took a wicket,12
"Iyer the best captain india needs

....we will have a bowl theeeenqs!!  ( when all wins of DC are by defending)",6
Warner is giving us the middle finger,17
Warneyyy,7
Pant plays like I do on cricket 19 as a left handed batsman. Get inside the line and play everything to fine leg,2
"Warner gonna finish the over?

Please yes",8
Swear Warner used to bowl medium pace,3
"Fuck, we lost Mitchell, Bhuvi, Kane for a few matches and 3D through injuries alone. It's like we're fucking cursed.

Edit: And Saha also had a groin pull this match",20
David Warnie,22
Damn havent seen Warner bowl in quite a long time,6
r/Cricket you just had your biggest wish of Warner bowling come true.,31
Now I’ve seen it all,12
[removed],3
WARNER BOWLING man is really wildin on his birthday,17
"Yesterday I had a dream that India didn't make it in the Top 4 and semis in T20 WC 2020 and missed out the berth and the spot by 2 points and India's highest run scorer was Kohli followed with Rohit and we still lost and couldn't make it to semis and also we lost to Pakistan badly and beat NZ in our first match and lost against England in a do or die match where we needed to win 4 out of 4 matches and we won the previous 3 but lost to England in the 4th match and got knocked out.It was a bad and shitty dream,hope this doesn't come true.Lol.

Guess who made it to the top 4:-

England

Australia

South Africa

Sri Lanka",3
It's cool to see big players like Jonny doing 12'th man job really well.,10
Warner showing 3D how it’s done,5
Shane Warner with his offspin,11
Warner is just taking the piss isn't he? 😂😂😂,22
LMAO warner bowling,8
Warne(r),9
David Warner just ripped off Lyon's action lmao,5
Warner almost got a wicket wtf,12
Now we have 9 bowlers in lineup now..,11
Warner gives his absolute 100 percent for this team,8
Did Warner just bowl,3
Delhi Daredevils back on track. Also How the fuck is Rahane such a terrible player of spin?,3
"Iyer as a captain has been a big, big flop when it has mattered.  Don't understand the point of giving it to him in the first place.",-1
What the fuck is with SRH and injuries?,2
Warner's economy is better than Rabada's,9
The only reason Shankar should be shitted is on how fragile his body is.,3
I hope Saha and Shankar are both fit:,3
"DC's next two matches are against RCB and MI. They should be scared, very scared!",3
Absolutely dangerous levels of bants on display.,3
Selectors would be zoom calling each other to pat each other's back.,2
"Shane WarneR, is that you?",5
"warner : "" fine ill do it myself """,10
Warner doing it all today lmao.,1
Is there someone named Warnest out there?,7
Warner bowling good actually damn👌🏾👏🏽👏🏽,1
Should have caught. One more over plz,1
Rashid to finish,2
David Warne,10
Chill guys Axar is on the crease. He has chased 17 rpo before this season.,1
Now give 3Ds overs to Kanos,7
3 bowlers injured now ffs,6
SRH has sold it's player's souls to the devil for a victory,5
Warner Most passionate and craziest out there,6
SRH have half a squad and are still in contention. Its a miracle.,9
Looks like RCB vs DC is going to be a knockout the way both the teams are playing currently,4
"v raju, axar patel and y chahal go to a gym. hayden bunches them together and does a bench press with the bundle.",4
Wow. Since when did CSK start playing in blue?,1
"all joking aside the parity in the IPL is wonderful. Does any other sports league in the world compete? Top to bottom, IPL is very deep.",7
ive now seen warner bowl legspin medium pace and off spin,4
Warner - “I can’t do anything wrong today. Let me bowl and test my luck”,7
This has been such an unfortunate season for SRH.,6
"Was looking at the remaining fixtures just to see if a miracle is on the cards but lmao it's so insanely unlikely that SRH qualify from here.  
 
Both KKR and KXIP play RR and CSK in their remaining games. RR can win both their matches with it being a concern for SRH, KKR and KXIP can only win one at most, CSK can do whatever it wants, and SRH must win both their remaining games which just happen to be against the table toppers.",6
Thanks Delhi. Very cool. So 2 shots at the finals for us inshallah,9
I'm glad that kid wasn't a CSK fan.,8
Pant playing a forward defence. Wow.,3
FYI First time Warner bowling in T20.,5
Solid forward defence from Pant.,1
Pant making sure he gets a good practice before the Australia tour,2
"Yer a wizard Rashy.

Imma wut?",3
"Rishabh ""Thala"" Pant",1
RR above 15 and Pant pulls out a forward defence.,-1
"You either get dropped for a weak form or live long enough to see yourself an all rounder - said Warner, prolly.",1
"Rashid still in the single digits run OP, man gets upset when he goes for single 😂",3
With the amount of T 20 matches Rashid Khan plays every year across globe and his age I feel he will get 1500 wickets in T20 at the end of his career !!! (May be more lol),10
Reminds me of a left handed Dhoni.,1
"Pant should play some 70(50) and protect the NRR as much as possible, would be nice to get him back in touch",2
"Keep Pant away from Dhoni, please!!",3
Man if pant ends up playing a blinder today what a tight slap it would be for the people who have been critizing him... Still remember hearing on stump mic while he was batting with hardik pandya in wc19 bhaiya daar lag raha hain.... He's fucking 23 and already gave him the Dhoni taq... Let him breathe for fuck sake,17
Saha looks like ross geller.,1
Arey yaar someone open a DC depression thread coz it's about to kick in.,6
Pant started practising for Australia test already.,4
What happened to Warner's leg spin with the 'Shane Warne' run up?,3
It would be funny if Delhi or rcb don't end up making it,6
"SRH and injuries, name a better pair. What the hell.",10
[deleted],12
David Warner mystery spinner,11
"Thala pant, playing for the nrr",3
Rashid going for the kill,4
Inshallah boys defended well.,7
I remember KP mocking Kohli for having chicken legs and Kohli saying that he hasn't tore his hammies even once and how he can run as fast as anyone else. Respect to Kohli for taking care of his body like a temple.,17
How many srh players are now injured??,3
Rashid is surely gonna get 🐐 status in IPL spinners if he continues this.,33
"Delhi is of course losing to MI and RCB, what a limp dick ending to a promising start... feels bad man",7
Absolute masterclass from Rashid,3
Rashid overs aside also they are not showing intent only i mean they would not have chased 140 also this way,3
Some users here jinxed DC,3
Rashi not going to let Siraj hold onto his record :(,4
Haters gonna hate but Pant has convinced me his selection in Test Team ❤️,16
Net RR goes brrrrrrrrr,7
Pant is on 20(22) chasing 220,6
Delhi are shit,2
Rashid is such a legend,6
Will they bowl Williamson? What do you guys reckon?,12
"In a chase of 220, Rashid bowls his quota for 7/3. Mind blown",15
Stupid play all through.. last 2 balls of Rashid left and you wanna slog now.. fuckn morons.,8
Nice catch,1
Rashid is a BEAST,6
[removed],5
Lol at axar trying to hit Rashid,8
This is just painful to watch. Ouch,3
I am guessing DC are not going to release the post match team meeting with Ponting.,7
Can someone test rashid to see if he is human,12
Delhi not even going for their nrr,3
Lol,2
Decalre kardo yar better he,7
is that the 3rd soft dismissal?,1
SRH NRR GOES BRRRRRRR,3
"Delhi, are you even gonna make 150 at this rate?
r/cricket: Damn boi!",3
Lmao I have a feeling DC might just crash out,7
Rashid ain't no Jadeja,6
Rashid's figures are incredible even for a test match.,9
"Charge down, move side to side, do a switch hit, at least try something ffs. You cannot play 4 overs for 7 runs chasing 219 ffs",6
Rashid man,4
"Man, SRH really struck gold in 2017 with Rashid",23
Warner’s intent on 🔥 🔥 🔥,11
Waiting for Ponting speech,3
Everyone else is getting out and Pant is getting criticised here. WOW,2
Squat Catch,2
"Fantasy scoring system needs to be more dynamic than it currently is, if they want the points to be a truer reflection of the actual performances.",6
Hello darkness my old friend.,5

Obligatory DC fuck up^TM,1
Man! We shit.,2
That last match now hurts more for the Sunrisers,8
"Dread it, run from it, Rashid's gonna strike all the same.",6
It is so unfair the SRH has Rashid fuck,8
"Rashid Khan is unplayable on most days. Seriously, how good is this guy that a spell of even 14/1 is seen as normal by this guy?",8
Just get out by 10:30 and let me get back to my book,5
Rashid about to overtake Siraj's one good record in IPL 😭😭,10
"how more sensible you need pant to bat, bcci?",6
DC have properly crumbled over their past few games,4
Now Pant can practice for Aus test tour,7
Can delhi win from here. Getting scared. RRR still at 19,1
Fuck. I expected DC to lose today but not this bad,4
No Jadeja no fun,1
Lol we didn't tried to chase and now we are failing to save some NRR. Fuck me,4
If only Dhoni didn't bowl Jadeja against DC in the last over. DC would be at 12 points,1
Sunrisers are the quiet NRR farmers,9
"**12.5** Rashid Khan to Patel, OUT, **swiped straight to deep midwicket.** Full ball outside off, half a stride out for the slog and he's not close enough to generate power on it. It's off the inside half and floats out to Garg **83-6**

AR Patel c sub (PK Garg) b Rashid Khan 1 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00",3
"Pant going to score 150* and win the match for Delhi and then pull out a crumpled paper from his pocket which says: ""Butter Chicken and Naan power""",3
[deleted],4
*Cries in Siraj*,4
Will DC be looking to score 140 or whatever they need  for run rate thing or trying 2 win?,5
Rashid gunna get the best ipl bowling figures ever and still not get motm,8
Record breaking spell THIS SEASON,15
Rishabh Pant is Dhoni 2020.,2
"Genuine question:

Bowlers are encouraged to learn some hitting for high scores (especially in T20)

Should batsman be encouraged to bowl a little?",6
Rashid you MADLAD,5
"Lmao, did some users change their flair back to Delhi Daredevils😂😂😂😂😂",22
"Rashid,Warner and Kane. We are truly blessed",21
Ethical drops below KG now!,4
Holy fuck 17 dot balls by Rashid,7
Madlad 4 overs 7 runs 3 wickets,10
axar patel never pays for his air tickets. he travels in the overhead compartment.,9
Punter is going to kill someone tonight.,11
Rashid is a legend,7
Rabada to make up for his bad bowling today with the bat,2
Another time out wtf,3
Rashid bowled 4 overs for 7 against a team chasing 220 WTF,42
"4 overs 3 for 7

This guy is gold",17
Inb4 Rabada with 600 SR,6
"Rashid Khan: Economy of 5 with 17 wickets

Seriously is a class above everyone else. What a gem",22
Beautiful stuff Rashid,9
Tomorrow RCB and MI are going to one up each other and try their best to lose.,15
If srh won against kkr and kxip like they were supposed to. They would have had such an advantage,6
Man i'm loving these lenskart ads,6
Sad thing is that Ashwin's yt channel has gone silent since the last defeat. There won't be any until next match now 😒,15
Rashid GOD Khan wow bow down everybody,9
Lord Siraj record gone.,9
"Sub-2 economy and 3 wickets. Rashid is 🐐

nuff said",12
Just logged in wtf has happened today? 200 on dubai pitch? Why DC choose to bowl first?,2
Nichologasm,1
Has Ashwin's batting degraded to the extent that he's regularly batting below Rabada? Sad man,2
Fuckers taking timeout now knowing fully aware that we are getting bowled out before the 16th over also,3
That is one hell of a spell from 15 year old.,11
"On a usual day, Rashid's 3-7 in 4 overs would be man of the match performance. But would he get it today?",13
"Rashid gave away 7 runs. In 4 overs. When DC are chasing 220. 3 wickets too. 

What a absolute mad lad",20
Fucking KXIP will reach top 2 aren't they,5
Really sad to see DC lose like this. Fuck it who cares lose by 100 runs and give that 2nd position,10
">Fuck you

-Pant to Kohli and Shastri",1
"Reminder that DC will have a negative NRR if they score less than **123** and NRR less than RCB if they score less than **145**

To retain their second position, they need to cross 145",3
"Well done, Rashid. Though I'm lowkey mad that his figures are literally a run less than Siraj's",6
"Instead of timeout, introduce forfeit.",3
That Lenskart DD ad is a perfect remniscent of what us Delhi fans have been experiencing this season. Ball (Playoff spot) in the air and dropped lmao,4
"Rashid has been insane this season. The opposition is almost always just trying to play him out, yet he still plucks 1-2 wickets every game. Shame that he's surrounded by hot garbage",10
Teams should literally always bat first against SRH. There was literally no reason to field first today especially considering what SRH did in the previous game and how Delhi also failed to chase.,6
"Dc batsmen to rashid after seeing runs given in single digits
I notice you have copied my style",7
[deleted],2
God tier spell from Rashid,6
How much money do you think pant spends on his pr?,4
That Nescafe ad is genius👍🏽👌🏾👌🏾,2
"CSK-esque. 

Remember when this was a complement?

I remember.

Cries.",7
Rabada dude atleast give a couple of fantasy points. You're sitting on -2,12
[deleted],2
Rashid Khan will break all records if he ever goes out for an auction. What a player!!,8
4-0-7-3 Lmao.,6
"4-0-7-3 
YRKFA peeps",7
Rashid is a cheat code,11
God fucking damn it I hate evey IPL team except RCB of course but ngl i have a love affair with SRH,6
"I wish whoever wins the tournament, gives Rashid the cup to hold for a moment. He has been too good to not hold the trophy",8
Why is nakli deshpande even playing? Harshal Patel can somewhat bat atleast,2
[removed],6
"Rashid may be 22 or 45 or whatever, he’s the best T20 spinner in the world.",26
3/7 from 4 overs is just mental.,9
Where's that DC fan who trash talks every team?,11
"Looks like Pant's gonna hang around til the end to preserve their NRR, singles and dots",7
Google giving DC a 0.6% probability to win. No trust on Pant!,12
Rashid Khan holy shit!!!,7
Economy of 1.75 in a 220 chase. My god dc are bad,12
Would be fun if KXIP qualifies and DC doesn’t. REVERSE UNO,6
Who tbe fuck is commentating? Best ever IPL figures it seems.  Remember Sohail Tanveer?,0
Pant should do a thala and save the NRR now. That eill be a good enough innings,3
Have a feeling Dc will lose their remaining 2 games and lose their playoff spot,6
"Kkr broke Delhi, who'd have thought",5
RIP to dream 11 guys,4
Would love too see DC internal meeting videos after the match. Need to see how Pointing smashing them,6
"Is DC done for the season? They have been systematically broken down and obliterated the last 2 games, and they play MI next. How do you recover from this, especially with KXIP and KKR hot on their tail?",7
Dumb question but are they the best figures in the IPL ever or just this season? Mark made it a bit confusing,1
OK. I am going to say it. I want Rashid to get a chance to captain an IPL team someday. He is so loved all over India!,10
A bowler like Rashid is an unbelievable asset. Single handedly adds 3 runs to the required rate.,17
r/cricket users changing their flairs back to Delhi Daredevils😜😝😝😛😛,10
Damn I need to get married and have a kid so I can get an LIC policy,5
[removed],10
Can’t see how Pant’s innings can be criticised when the rest of the team is 63-6,8
"Absolutely unbelievable spell from Rashid

DC needed on average 11 an over to win from the start of their innings, even higher by the time he came on to bowl

He went for 7 runs in 4 overs

Ridiculous",18
I shit on CSK so much my team became CSK,8
[removed],11
Delhi in real danger of getting knocked out of next stage,3
"Well here's the thing. DC didn't really do there homework and went all pace. They could have gone for Sams and Harshal(both slower ball bowlers) but went for express pace. Also could have used Lamichane today. Damn, we are missing Mishraji",1
"Guys, have we memed DC into poor form?",3
Indian team really wanted Dhoni. So Pant delivered. Tuk tuk for lyf. He is going to stay not out today but hit a few sixes in the last over to complete his transformation,4
"Even in an unsuccessful season, everyone trying to copy us #superkings #whistlepodu",-1
"One of the Top 3 teams will be knocked out. 

Cries in RCB!",3
we thought that rcb needed to reach top 2 for an rcb kxip final but it now looks like kxip will make the top 2,4
"Rashid Khan figures this year vs Delhi : 

20 runs 6 wickets",10
"Take a bow Rashid Khan! 

Also.. Mark Nicholls royally fucked that up.",10
Only ethical big hitting from Ashwin can save this for DC.,3
"So going off the rail, losing the mojo, falling to pieces, which one is it DC?",1
[Pant on the inside](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/002/862/SadKeanu.jpg),3
"Siraj record lasted less than my relationship, good record tho",8
"How on earth can you let anyone bowl:-

4-0-7-3?",8
rashid khan's stats are amazing right now,4
[deleted],9
GG boys. Hope they bounce back like KKR kinda did after 84/8,5
Pant to Rabada - Bhaiya darr lag rha hai,5
Unless and until Pant plays the best T20 innings ever we still have a horrible batting unit,10
"From 17/7 to 219/2. SRH batting is like making dum Biriyani. Do it well, it can be the tastiest one. Screw up the layers, it goes to trash.",10
"I think DC gonna make playoff, but will be eliminated in first eliminator",2
"Siraj: Looses his IPL record 

Dinda Academy:  You could not live with your  failure.Where did it bring you,back to me",6
RCB to DC: You've become the very thing you swore to destroy.,17
"Now will we see the ""happy"" DC team?",3
Punter should have opened today,4
"So this is the Delhi that everyone thought could be in the IPL Finals?
Let alone win it?

Wut?",3
"Rashid being a magician


DC being mediocre



Gayle and KL winning it for KXIP



Pant being DC's only hope


Is it 2018 again?",10
oh no can dc win another game?  nrr will still just be in their favour as they limp into playoffs,2
Rabada better than Ash??,0
Iyer could cry rn,5
This is the monkey's paw version for everyone who wanted Pant to play like Dhoni. Be careful what you wish for.,10
Pant should just retain strike for the next 40 balls,6
Lol Iyer about to cry after that convo with Warner,4

Rishabh Pant making a strong pitch for ODI selection,5

Man fuck this match and the results idc but what happend to Pant ??? Come on Pant!,5
Rashids today's spell was tight slap on selectors face.... What a man has to do more to get into Indian T20i side,44

TIL Rabada is a left handed batsman,2
Nattu has literally one formula at death. Yorkers or just thereabout. Admire his mentality and ability to stick to his strength,4
Yo Brian Rabada Lara,4
"Man, IPL is sure fun to watch when it is not your team who is getting their ass kicked!",19
It's amazing how many people here are literally so hatefully happy that we are going down. Unreal fanbases some.,3
Just going to make a guess that the extra weight put on by Pant this season has fucked up his body balance during shot making. He is unable to generate the same power and timing in the strokes consistently he was able to earlier.,7
Remember all the gurus criticizing Kane and Pandey saying ThEy ShOuLd HaVe ScOrEd 230+?,9
"Imagine MI buying Rashid Khan in next auctions...
Hope this never ever happened or it will be deemed quite criminal offence...",2
r/Cricket to DC: Gonna cry?,14

Rashid causally on that list with a 5.00 economy omg,7
Hopefully they don’t lose anymore wicket before tea.,12
Dont let them past 120🙏🙏🙏,6
"Is this first batsman to get ""line and lengthed"" ?",1
What the fuck are they even trying to achieve.,3
How Ashwin has fallen- From opening for domestic team to coming below Rabada in batting,8
Samad making up for last match!,5
Man seeing us this dominant today is frustrating. So many close games that we've pissed away and so many injuries at inopportune times. Even half of those things going our way and we would've probably sealed our playoffs spot by now.,6
Panth is actually dhoni succesor,8
"Ffs when is Ashwin gonna come to bat, I desperately need some fantasy points from him",5
SRH: I have won but at what cost,8
Rashid economy rate is 5.00 this year. That's just phenomenal.,9
Genuine Q. You're telling me this dc whacked us and many other teams throughout the tournament but are falling apart here?,13
"Come on SRH, help your southern bros out.",10

"Srh could have done so much:
- kxip game, needed more intent

"Well it's unlikely for a mi vs dc final now right?

Delhi's weakness is chasing scores and also over reliant on Dhawan",2
"Mitch Marsh, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, Kane Williamson and now Wriddhiman Saha & Vijay Shankar. It's been a horrific set of injuries for SRH. And they're still competing.",19
Has the confidence completely been knocked out of Pant?,3
People shitting on pant as if it's his fault the entire top and middle order shat the bed,33
This is just sad to watch. Poor Delhi :(,3

"It's actually sad seeing Pant bat like this

He's capable of so much more",2
Rabada is quite handy with the bat. I remember back in 2017 when Delhi collapsed to 24/6 against us and he came in and stemmed the rot. Got them to 120+ that night.,6
What’s happened to Pant?,1
I think Saha got it wrong playing that way. Pant repaying the faith in selectors by actually playing REAL TEST innings!,8
"Pant is highest dc scorer this match

Moral victory",11
Rashid bhai- don’t injure yourself,7
"Kagiso is such a cool name. and then it follows with Rabadaaaaa. there is so much punch in his name. you feel good when you say that name. for perspective, my name is Dagdu Bhuskute.",7

Not even taking non risky doubles. It's Dubai not Sharjah!",5
King Rashid felt bad for Delhi and gave us runs <3,9
There was a time when Pant used to cunt Bhuvi's wide Yorkers behind,2
Lol Rashid swimming in the grass,7

"Pant knows he does not need to audition for the AUS test squad anymore, right? He in already in.
Try some T20 brother.",3
"this is for the dc twats who rubbed off srh as if this was a guarantee win. in your face, fuckers",4

It feels like SRH has 20 fielders and as if we had like 5. Really shows the importance of field placement and bowling to your field.,14
Pant doesn't want to hit a bad shot. He knows people will criticise him more if he loses handle of his bat while hitting a six than scoring at run a ball playing normal shots.,10
Don't worry guys Pant is turning into a perfect Dhoni replacement with this innings,13
Dont worry dc fans tewatia will bail you out,5
This guy isn’t a bad keeper,4
"SRH is the most wholesome team. Sure there are no marquee players or big fights or rivalries, but you always feel happy if this team wins",13
Okay the run rate is 24 now. I think I can start celebrating. Right guys? Right? *blinks nervously*,14
"Pant boi, u aren't helping me when I defend u for the squad",6

uhh PaNt jUsT LiKe ThALa hurr meme,4
You know you're monumentally fucked when Rahane has the Best SR of the Innings.,1
Lol can't even hit full tosses.,2
SRH fans do you feel you are underutilising Rashid the slogger? Admit I haven't watched many SRH games,3
Women’s game! Yay!!,2
Not able to put a full toss away... Dude need to go back to domestic circuit and farm some confidence and maybe improve his technique a bit,2
"Dhawan, Rahane, Iyer all didn’t show up today. Yet all comments are about how slow Pant is today",5
Yorker / Full toss baba,2
146 to stay above RCB,7
Can DC beat MI or RCB? Because they're in real trouble if they can't,7
I miss the pant who used to swing his bat so hard that it used to leave his hand,11
Can we all sign a petition to shave off that neckbeard? It gets hideous by the day...,13
"Valuable innings from him? 33 off 31, he had like a negative strike rate off 20 something balls. 

Anyone else think Pant is hugely overrated?",2
SRH is completely different team when Warner's at his best.,16
"I won't lie, I have not the slightest clue about the Women T20's

:(",9
Who is keeping for SRH?,5
Rcb will get to 2nd place if DC have a horrible NRR drop.,3
Why does Abhishek Sharma look like a lean Stoinis?,5
"Mom, can we have Thala?

We have Thala at home

Thala at home: R. Pant",9
I have no idea why am I still watching this match.,12
"Unpopular opinion: Apart from those rare Yorkers, nattu is a very ordinary bowler.",24
"All RR fans right now:

(Insert disappointed bald guy meme) XD",7
ah Abhishek didnt expect the swerve,6
Yass that's what we're talking Nattu! VARIATIONS!,7
"That early onslaught by Warner looks so impressive now. 
Warner to Rabada probably: ""You think pace is your ally. But you simply learnt to bowl fast. I was born in it, moulded by it. I didn't face balls below 140 until I was already a man, By then they were nothing to me but Pies!!! (smashes six)",43
Pant in Jr.Thala mode.,6
Bullseye™,3
SRH so unlucky with injuries this year :(,5
Beauty Nattu!!,6
Unplayable,4
At least this season our Fielding has been exceptional,6
"Rashid Khan : Breathes


Everyone : Why do I hear boss music",15
"I genuinely wonder how DC's campaign would've turned out if they hadn't won that infamous ""1 off 3"" match against Punjab. I think that win gave them confidence beyond measure but now after a couple of losses, the cracks are starting to show.",15
This DC is a shell of the team they were in the beginning.,5
Warner couldn’t have asked for a better birthday gift,13
Any clue Ashwin ain’t batting ahead of Rabada*,5
Nattu now has more yorker wickets in this match than Rabada. Oops 🙊,12
Why my pp suddenly big,12
"Nattu x Yorker

Still a better love story than twilight",22
Okay we have another guy who won't go Berserk when he picks a wicket like Bhuvi!,29
"**15.6** Natarajan to Rabada, OUT, **yorker onto the base of off stump.** **103-7**

Can DC still get out of top 4? If so how?,8
Natrajan's source of power is his beard,11
"thala patented nrr run chase going on. I'm going to add in process, intent and spark just because i can",5
Koach has totally destroyed Pants Natural explosive style,13

Pant learned well from Dhoni using dead overs to find form,-4
We have lost Pant of 2018 -2019 season. Bad thing for Indian team,1
Rooting hard for DC to be bowled out under 119,0
Fuck KG got yorked. Now he knows how other batsmen feel like getting bowled to him like that,3
"this thread in a nutshell
1:30 hours ago :- UGGGH SRH Y U NO SCORE 240 WE GONNA LOOOSE
Now:- Bliss Delhi 140. Pant bad. Shreyas Sed",16
Shreyas Iyer’s expression right now is the exact same look KL was sporting for the first half of the tournament.,28
Ashwin would have batted better than Rabada.,3
Natarajan is abnormally mature and I mean that in a good way,3
not being sexist but Anjum Chopra needs to shut the fuck up,8
"DC DC get all out, 

come soon for the next match,

Little Warner wants his birthday!",8
Feel like pure shit just want 2018 pant back,8
[deleted],7
Guys did you see that slap down the ground for 4 by pant? I keep rewatching that shot. Just so amazed you know by his talent!,0
Irresponsible of Shreyas and Ponting to save their best batsman for #9,8
"The funny thing is that Pant is actually one of the only players in the world who would have chased the target if he was sent in the Power play instead of Hetty, Delhi literally shot their own foot",18
Imagine chasing 220 and you think you should give Rashid Respect. Playing for the net-runrate? Then why the fuck are you 103-7 after 16 overs!?,13
"Someone tweet to bangar that we can see the score, its not radio where he needs to tell the score every ball, every wicket.",13
DC will learn it's not easy to even  just qualify for playoffs  consistently. That's why CSK's record is truly insane,10
Lmao a review out of spite,10
need conclusive to overturn,2
Sreevats said no but Warner still went ahead. Well might as well use it now.,7
Bruh,1
HAHAHAHAH WARNER WITH THE REVIEW,6
Mightn't be a bad review I reckon,3
Natarajan's beard makes him look like he has slid down his mask below his mouth.,9
[deleted],7
"Its been a good 3-4 years, but it's still hard to believe Shreyas is an Iyer. Indian media has brainwashed me into what I think when I think about Iyer.",7
Warner with his DRS signal . LOL . Umpire not even caring .,3
Jason Momoa v Arnold Schwarzenegger,2
Warner just vibing,7
just end it so that i can see RCB in top 2 and go to sleep,9
I've never seen a more confident review,16
Warner reviewing for a wide. That's a new thing. Pant has been given out,11
"Mark my words, Nattu would deserving score 7+ crores in next auction",7
Warner doesn't want to waste the review.,3
That's surely not a wide?,12
"Team form may go up and down, IPL umpiring will remain shitty forever.",9
"Even if he hasn't nicked the ball, how tf is that a wide?",12
Goswami had Pant in his Dream 11 team,12
"Can't bat, won't walk

Must be pant",16
Out,5

"Admit it r/cricket fans, most of you wanna shit on Delhi, but are afraid to be downvoted or banned😝😝",11
Can’t give that out!,5
Bc it's the bat hitting the ground ffs,8
Feels bad for DC ngl,1
Pant trying to be unethical in front of ethical mind!,10
How good a captain warner is?. He has been phenomenal for SRH over the years.,29
Remember that season when both Kohli and Warner racing towards 1000 runs in single IPL?? Doubt anyone can replicate that form.,19
Lmao Warner heard that from the ropes but the umpire didn't,16
"Erm, he hit the ground?",6
SRH fans are calculating possible NRRs RN with one hand down their pants.,11
Everyone on field looks confused?,5
Bruh that's the bat on the ground,7
Saha>>>>Pant,5
How's that conclusive enough to overturn the on-field decision,9
What the fuck how is that out,3
Lol. That's a really bad decision.,4

Lol..Shrivats said it didn't touch.,10
This is why we need Hotspot,19
First left out of team and now Bret Lee saying Pant should've walked after nicking that.  Poor 24 hrs for my man 😞,6
"I don't think you can overrule that decision on the basis of that evidence tbh

It was probably out but there wasn't conclusive evidence to overrule it",0
Give Warner a medal for reviewing that. He was fielding in the boundary!,13
lmaoo the ump was so tentative for the reverse call signal,17
That's shithouse.,2
"Imagine actually saying if you take away Nattu's yorkers which is his main strength, he's ordinary. 

Since we're conflating ridiculous opinions with unpopular,

""If we take away Rashid's ability to bowl wrong 'uns at will with pace, he's ordinary""

""If you took away Dale Steyn's ability to bowl outswingers at pace in red ball cricket, he wouldn't have been as good""

""If you take away Rohit Sharma's pull shot, he wouldn't be good vs the short ball""",73
Lol that clapping looked so wholesome,15
"Pant is like nah, I don't hit it.",6
Love how when umpires get a decision wrong they have to touch their nipples.,24
there goes your overrated *once in a generation* talent.,7
That's bat hitting the ground,-1
Abe how the fuck was that out,4
"Lol. When it rains, it pours",11
It's that kind of a day for DC,3

Ridiculous umpiring..,5
Pant's offside weakness is concerning. They've been bowling him same lines and he's unable to do much there,5
Pant justifying his test selection,2
"I think the IPL is not fixed but planned... <Insert reasoning here>

How huge a dent will this make on DC's NRR tho,2
"Umpire doesn't follow conclusive evidence rule
ICC: you are fired",4
Is hotspot just not available in IPL?,7
You remember the thread the other day when DC fans were talking about which team they'll face in the finals?,17
Fuckwit umpiring!!,3
"**16.1** Sandeep Sharma to Pant, OUT, **big appeal for catch behind.** Umpire has signaled wide. Warner takes the review. It's a full ball dipping away wide outside off. He reaches out and looks for the drive through point. On early viewing, the bat has definitely hit the ground. There is a tiny spike on Ultra Edge as the ball goes past bat. The bat hits the ground a few frames after that. It's very close, a matter of frames. But the third umpire has gone on the evidence of sound and overturned the decision **103-8**

RR Pant c sub (SP Goswami) b Sandeep Sharma 36 (35b 3x4 1x6) SR: 102.85",5
Seems ethical mind rubbed the shoulders with Warner. Superb review.,2
DRS moving sus like VAR,0
Getting harder and harder to convince myself that DC are just getting all of the bad form out of the way before the finals... :/,2
Well played lads! Just lose the last 2 well too to make sure I can save some time.,8
Warner who is near the boundary line heard that edge but not the stupid ass umpire,9
lmao icing on the cake that last dismissal... DC is royally fucked.,6
Too easy for Tushar Deshpande...,5
Pant looks like he is about Holders pant height.,7
Too less evidence imo. Seemed like the Bat hit the ground,5
"Okay, guess mah Bois are finally safe. Looking at all the choking this season, I was scared ngl",4
Bruh are Delhi slipping into negative? Lmao,17
The memes if DC who were touted to win the whole thing end up not even making the playoffs.,14
"Where's that kid who said ""fuck off"" when DC won some match? Should train him for IPL 2026.",13
"Gaand me sariya ghusa diya aaj toh

T: Shoved a steel rod up the asshole today",5
"That is clearly out. The first spike happens when the bat is still in the air and the ball is next to the bat, and then you have the spike from the bat hitting the ground.",13
Sad to see pant losing his x-factor just to secure a place in the team. We want to see pant as the explosive player he is but koach has fucked him over and now he will disapper into abyss,5
Lol few days ago people were talking about which team might face Delhi in the finals😝😜😜😝😜😜😜😛😛😛😛😛,9
"Got out on such a wide ball. Having never seen Pant in form before, I was really looking forward to see some shots but it was a big disappointment. Saha was on another level today and that too in his first match.",6
A selfish innings comes to an end.,2
"Imagine if RR, SRH, KKR and KXIP qualified",27
"Birthday man can Bat, Field, Bowl. Nothing can go wrong for him today.",16

Ponting has destroyed Pant's batting style with the responsibility shit!,6
Daily reminder that Delhi's owners thought it would be nice to let David Warner and AB de Villiers go.,10
"Maa chudalo Delhi Daredevils,  haarte raho aur humari ummeed ki gaand mardo bhosdwalon, toss jeet ke batting lete huye hi jeet te hai but bhosdk tumhe 220 run dene hai aur lauda chase toh hota nahi, NRR ki bhi gaand marvalo tum bhosdk

Come on Ash ramp one over the keeper,1
Warner gearing up for Butta Bomma remix,11
This sub has an healthy amount of Pant bashers and Pant supporters duking it out every thread,8
Thank us later RCB by losing to us.,2

So dc has the opportunity to get the second lowest score of the ipl,1
Stoinis with the enthusiastic clapping lmao.,2
Pant was so bad that now I am not even angry at his non selection,3
Ethical practicing his pull shot for the Aussie tests,9
Sad to see Pant like this. Hopefully he gets back to his 2018 self.,3
"I feel pant and kuldeep are two players who have been given the opportunity but not managed well inside indian team..they always look a little lost to me.

Unless this is corrected we might risk losing two natural talents to bad man Management.",4
Really liking how the table has become closer over the past few games with the top ranked teams losing,5
Ashwin timing the ball better than Pant who faced 30+ balls Lmao,9
Former no1 all-rounder boys,3
"I have been highly successful in life being cocky. It’s better than being under confident if you want my take on things.

Regarding DC, they should run away with the tournament but the management is really questionable at times so I doubt it. This is a better DC team for example:

Stoinis (Shaw is super unreliable)
Dhawan
Rahane
Iyer
Pant
Hetmyer
Axar
Ashwin
Nortje 
Rabada
Ishant Sharma

I don’t see this team losing too many games despite Iyer who doesn’t use his strike bowlers before the match the over.

But oh well, it is what it is.",-5
Why is everyone blaming Kohli for Pant? Is it not true that he used to play irresponsible shots and get out? Players need to know the fine line between being aggressive and throwing your wicket away. Telling that is not fucking over someone.,8
"If this game did anything, it reaffirmed sahas batting than pants.",8
Fuck Warner is also tapping his hammie. Hope he's alright,6
Oh shit DC has games against MI and RCB. And their NRR is gonna take a ha meeting again. Suddenly they need to win both their games to qualify.,3
RCB gonna be second without even playing their match. That's some really 2020 thing.,3
"* *Ashwin hits boundary* *


Initiating RR vs KXIP 2019 PTSD",7

"Unpopular opinion: If virat doesnt have the ability to bat, he is an ordinary player",21
whats with these bowlers not standing up to stumps? dafuk IPL fielding,7
"NRR check - DC scoring 130 means DC +0.02, SRH 0.40",7
We gonna get into the top 2 without even playing today,4
Inb4 some turds criticise Pant for trying to play sensibly and not get out like an idiot after getting a start.,9
That should've hit the stumps. He had ample time and modern fielding standards requires you to hit it.,4
Hope this humbles DC and there ever so arrogant fans!,12
So it's gonna be MI vs ABD now,8
Ashwin is a far better batsman than his present number.,9
"Saha and Pant BOTH top scorers for their teams today. 

Saha played 10 balls more and scored \*51\* runs more.",11
I don't know if Rohan Gavaskar is trying too hard to be entertaining or he's always like this with random comparisons.,5
Lol Ashwin almost got anti mankaded (run out on the other end),2
Reverse of IPL 2016? Eventual winners lost twice to Delhi which came 5th.,4

"Why are people on this sub blaming Kohli for ruining Pant's natural game?
Pant got criticism from everywhere got throwing his wicket away repeatedly. Especially after that infamous semifinal against NZ where he had to just rotate the strike but threw his wicket away.

Of course the criticism was in excess and comparing him with Dhoni is unfair to him but why blame Kohli alone for this?",19
Please bois...need a win tomorrow,3
"Bhai, bowl Nattu and finish it off. Ffs",3
Should strip Shreyas off the captaincy. Should focus on his batting when the captaincy can be done by a much more experienced campaigner in Dhawan. Shreyas' body language on the field is infuriatingly bad.,7

" T20 ISNT FOR SHREYAS IYER

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

Today's poll

Most exciting DC player

Shreyas freking iyer with 44% Yeah very exciting singles",6

Why was Ashwin batting behind Rabada?,6
"I wonder if countries like New Zealand punch above their weight in cricket because they have such a small talent pool that everyone gets a decently long run in the side

In contrast, the pressure to perform is so immense in India that players don't get enough games to settle in - there's always someone else knocking on the door",17
Finally Holder's been blessed!,2
Ethical dismissal.,8
"Dumbass Ashwin, just rotate the strike and give Tushar some hits..",4
Pandey hit half his sixes in one game,7
Damn surprised Samad didn't throw the ball over the boundary after catching it,10
Sunrisers should give Fabian Allen a shot 1 game to see what he has,2
What’s holder’s celebration?,5
Bowlers trying to make up for earlier performances I see? 😂,10
Holder with Rabadaesque stats,7
That would have been 6 on most of the grounds.,4
Every bowler has a wicket now,5
Unpopular opinion: Nabi in for Holder,4
"Come on Warner, please bowl an over just for the LOLs",6
Lol Ashwin,1
DC need 146 to stay on top of RCB don't they?,5
"ONE MORE WICKET, 20 MORE RUNS PLS DP IT SRH",3
someone was saying “why is nakli deshpande playing instead of harshal patel who could atleast bat a little” right time to take them words back haha...,1
If Tushar can swing like this Dc still have a chance to win this match.,0
Bye bye dubaiahh,1
will warner get his first wicket,6
Holder throwing gang signs everytime after taking a wicket. Nice,5
"Bye bye ashwin, so rubbish",-8
Nabi should replace holder is sharjah and I would rather have abhishek over Nadeem if Nadeem is only gonna bowl 2 overs,2
"No playoff match in sharjah?

Boo!!",9
"Say it with me guys. 
Altroz is an ugly looking car.",19
Tbf that would have been a six in India,3
"Pant taking the ""become the next Dhoni"" tag too seriously by batting exactly like Dhoni does",9
Say what you want about Holder but he still took more wickets and was more economical than Rabada this match.,10
Ashwin is gonna mankad the whole batting line up in the next match,6
Warner bowl pls.,12
Why does Nortje have a fake belly,5
Does Warner even reach Holder’s shoulders ? 😂,4
DC still need 20 runs. To stay above RCB on NRR.,7
ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED!!!!,2
"**17.6** Holder to Ashwin, OUT, **taken at deep midwicket.** Overpitched on a middle stump line, there for the slog. But he's gotten too far under this, off the toe-end of the bat and taken on the line **125-9**

R Ashwin c Abdul Samad b Holder 7 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 140.00",2
no one knows what the three fingers up celebration is that holder does?,4
So DC and KXIP traded management during the trading window? That's the only explanation for this shithousery,11
SRH should play Nabi if Barstow is not playing next match.,3
When is this match gonna end?,5
Fast bowlers alliance is dead and gone.,8
Nortje mad he had to pad up,10
"Remember at start when DC were winning all matches his owner on Twitter used to tweet "" Hey RCB we accept your challenge"" ""Hey KXIP better luck next time DC is unstoppable"" wonder where he's now 😭😂😭😂",12
"Froxk, I thought wanner is gonna bowl one",1
Nattu boi york these shits,5
I get the feeling DC will still make playoffs but RCB will lose all their remaining games.,7
Tushar the new Sunil narine?,8
Tbh this situation should have been appropriate for a team to play for NRR and atleast get closer to the target. Delhi should have played smartly here.,2
Tushar looks useful with the bat,10
Fuckers had to open with Tushar smh,14
Deshpande vs RCB,17
This guy can really bat!!! Send him opening,7
Holder is so one dimensional. Looks like he's from the Siraj/Umesh academy.,-1
Deshpande single handedly trying to preserve the NRR.,12
DC has to survive 2 overs before end of Day 1,7
When Tushar has been your best batsman,15
Deshpande should low-key open for DC lmao.,10
Tushar for the Indian T20 team!,7
Make Tushar the captain ffs,11
"Delhi in first 9 games - Delhi Capitals

Delhi in last 3 games - Delhi Daredevils",16
Thala tushar playing for nrr,9
Holy fuck open with this guy ffs,7
"all other other teams to DC:

How the turn tables",1
They should have sent tushar ahead of pant and hetmeyer,3
Tushar's the new shardul,3
"Iyer is reminded of how to bat while chasing 220, by tushar",2
Why is iyer in this team? He's done nothing.,2
Dc isn't losing this ...they are crashing down..,1
Deshpande ruining my night,4
Tushar PANDYA!,6
Pointing considering Tushar to open next match.,6
So Tushar was actually a batsman who could bowl a little,11
"It seems many ""sensible fans"" weren't happy that DC played well in the first half which made their fans happy. Apparently DC fans aren't allowed to enjoy rare successes. Ok then.",2
Abe out hoja....,1
"Come on SRH 
Get that last one",3
Effing hell man RCB fan here bowl them out SRH do us a favor we want their run rate below ours,3
Bro Tushar gonna save our NRR 😭😭😭,6
Looks like RCB might end up being second on NRR  because of this massive defeat... It's gonna be 1st vs 2nd tommorow.. Probably the most sorted out teams in this year's ipl,4
Would've preferred seeing the top order getting out trying for sixes rather than the tail end,4
"Deshpande man don't ruin it for us, please!",13
Wtf was that,8
Tushar striking the ball better than Pant.,8
Now that's funny 😁,5
120 or 220- the match will end in the 19th over only,7
Remember Rabada saying 1 loss not being worrying. Dude must be sweating a bit now.,6
Samad and Rashid are everywhere!,4
Tushar>>>>>>Pant,2
Tushar opening next game.,10
That is a reverse reverse scoop. Lol,11
ABD taking notes from Tushar right now..,13
"Dhawan has the ""gaand lag gayi lol"" smile that I had after engineering exams.",7
Lmao Tushar > Dube. Don't @ me,8
Cmon get him srh!!!,1
That shot🤣😂😆😆😆😆,10
That's a new shot.,6
Scoop to point. Just beautiful,6
2018 Pant time travelled in deshpande,6
Ffs Bangar! Shut it,3
"Iyer is smiling seeing Tushar ""Specialist Batsman, Number 4 for India"" Deshpande hit runs but his eyes tell a different story.",11
Why is everyone from dc smiling,10
Tushar is leaking runs today as well... off his bat.,11
Wtf was that 😆,8
Holy shit 7.9 k comments for srh,14
Lmao tushar is definitely coached by Pant,10
"Sanjay....sanjay... No!!!

Altroz sux, and u promoting it is worse",10
Shut up Bangar. Tryin too hard,4
Delhi was jinxed the day Rahane was included in their XI.,6
Was he trying to ramp the ball on his own stumps,6
"Hey, at least Iyer still has perfect hair",3
Won’t be bad swapping Holder for Nabi to utilise soon at Sharjah.,3
"rcb, we will get that wicket before 20 runs, will you lose against us in return?",3
Sreevats is a hobbit in front of Holder,8
Laughing cuz Deshpande has shown more heart  than y'all combined? Hmmmm.,16
So umm..guys....what should happen for RCB to not qualify?,3
Shreyas today in post match presentation: Tushar batted well today,19
DC players can still laugh,4
"Ah, the reverse bat-edge scoop",11
"Shaw

Dhawan

Deshpande

Iyer

Pant

Stoinis

Hetmyer

Axar

Ashwin

Rabada

Nortje",6
Lol Dugout with that sarcastic promotion of Altroz. The company would be mad.,8
Fuck Yorkers man. At least 2 to 3 of his(Natarajan) deliveries reach as full toss. He either needs to make that Yorker a wicket taking one or work on other bowls,4
Tushar = Gayle + abd,12
"So used to Swanny commenting on the Altroz, anyone else just sounds wrong",8
"The last over is for Warner, isnt it?",9
Abd : finally a worthy opponent,19
Deshpande is playing desperately for his place in the side rn.,7
Finally ended it.,11
fuck YES,9
The end.,6
It's called the Tushcoop. It's going to be the next big thing.,20
Thats a 360 shot! ABD would be proud lol!!,13
You're welcome rcb,28
Yay!,5
Good catch by Garg. It went high.,18
Clinical as fuck,12
Didn't even played full 20 overs.. time for some spanking by Ponting..,7
Deshpande is the one who saved Delhi from going negative in NRR. Ironic.,12
Happy Warner >>>>> Angry Warner,19
Is Deshpande gettign so many chances because of Mumbai lobby? Like Rahane?,6
RCB fans are very happy rn. NRR saved.,16
DC slip to #3 and RCB climb to #2,5
"About time when franchises start having a Nrr strategy coach along with other 20 coaches which are there..

With teams so even in terms of quality and talent  future ipls wont be just about winning or losing but margins as well.

No ways it's gonna be 14/16 points for playoffs kinda easy.",4
12 runs per ball . Can we do it?,9
Oh shit DC not looking invincible anymore. Worrying times ahead.,20
Warner : Butta Bomaa is on the menu boys!,20
Aaand we are 2nd,13
Does RCB go ahead?,5
Gg,6
Take a bow SRH,12
That's some spanking delhi got,10
We have even wasted Tushar’s talent with the bat!,9
SRH to RCB: You're welcome,21
Nattu my man!!,12
GG this tournament for DC maybe,3
"With 14 matches to play, teams can afford to fuck up a couple of matches and even have a losing streak. The key is the stage where they fuck up. Biggest difference between KXIP and DC.",21
Nice to see Warner smile on his bday,16
"""Everyone played badly except the Tushar""",31
So that's 2-0 against DC this season?,37
Is this what they call an utter domination,11
Good Night DC,11
Congrats Rcb!!,15
Bro this must be what happiness would feel like,26
"**18.6** Natarajan to Nortje, OUT,  **131-10**

A Nortje c sub (PK Garg) b Natarajan 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33",5
"FUCK YOU, NATRAJAN. WE HAD THE CHANCE TO WATCH WARNER BOWL THE LAST OVER.",25
We fucking won ಥ◡ಥ),13
RCB thanks you for your service,26
RCB Fans!! Don’t forget our contribution!!,20
Hard luck DC. I am glad to see SRH on the winning side.,9
Perfect game for SRH. We have had two of those this tournament still won only 5. ಠ︵ಠ,13
Who are the ladies that always show up for the SRH games?,7
The Birthday-Loss curse has been broken,25
"Lmao. KKR, RR, KXIP and SRH gaining momentum. Fight for Number 4 is gonna be spicy.",11
Looks like Delhi have lost their momentum. So good in the first half of the tournament,7
What happened to swann? Did he have a day off?,5
Tushar to open both batting and bowling,14
Deshpande could have managed to get DC till 145.,4
Now just please win tomorrow,3
DC went from +0.9 NRR to the negative in 4 games,15
Still waiting for 2nd innings. Only 88 runs short,9
"man, its the most satisfying feeling to play the perfect game, prolly our best game this IPL ngl",23
"Garg is a gun fielder, also water is wet",10
Everyone in the top losing their way a bit and Punjab marching up. Interesting times ahead.,5
What is the NRR guys?,5
"0.03???? 

Rip nrr",6
Fuck me Holder is tall,11
Rashid or Saha for motm?,5
Desh pandey >>>> srh pandey,14
"RCB #2 :))

Until tomorrow :((",19
"genuine question: do players go in the dressing room and get dolled up after their innings or fielding? I always see koach/iyer with spiked, undisturbed hair even after batting/fielding with helmet/cap on.",7
Happy Birthday Warner Bhai🎂,17
I like how this is setup for Delhi: either beat teams you are most likely to face in the playoffs or just come back home before that!,9
Remember RCB fuckers... You are second because us.. So return the favour by loosing next match,31
"Hoping both MI and RCB lose tomorrow.

Still trying to figure out how.",22
"DC need some fresh blood in bowling, 2 matches gone for 190+ back to back. They should bring in Lamichane instead of Hetmyer",7
Happy birthday to warner and to whoever in this sub too,27
"DC lost 3 matches in a row, will they go 5 in row ????????",24
Fuck yes. Top 2 boiiiss,13
Two chases in a row where Delhi have been in the game for precisely 0 balls. Embarrassing.,19
RCB 2nd now lol,6
Hum jeet gaye bc,13
"1 v 2 tomorrow boys and girls, not 1 v 3.",16
SRH would’ve been better this tournament without injury plaguing them. Punjab would’ve been way better without a few chokes. Game of small margins.,22
"RCB gotta repay us ,I won't forget",28
Can't even fully savour this victory due to our position and the injuries to 3d and saha,29
This is why I never start hoping,8
DC down to third?,6
"At the end of the day we are the real winners, 2nd place Les go!!!",8
We r number two bois !,9
Tushar showed more intent than everybody combined.,13
thank you srh bros for getting us to 2nd place,18
I heard a sshhheeeyooon sound when the match ended and DCs NRR went down like crazy,15
"* No one: 
* RRR: 89.0
* CSK fans: csk qualified for playoffs more than any other team, if it was any other year, this was csk's match",20
Tomorrow's match winner will be the first team to qualify. RCBvsMI,22
Wow that NRR is fucked.,12
"Absolute travesty, our batting should be ashamed of their effort Tushar showed more intent than the top 6. Bowlers had another bad day but the batting has never clicked apart from some individual performances. Get Shaw in. Ponting has to have a word with Pant this responsible bullshit has happened for too long now.",10
[DD from 2017 says hello to DC of 2020](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/scorecard/1082635/delhi-daredevils-vs-mumbai-indians-45th-match-indian-premier-league-2017),6
Lmao I absolutely lost it at tushar's reverse sweep/ scoop,12
Has this happened before that a team not playing moved up the table,-4
THANK YOU SO MUCH SRH FROM AN RCB FAN,23
"apolgy for bad english

where were u wen DC die

i was at house eating dorito when phone ring 

""DC is kil""

no",35
"Damn, I wanted to see more shots from Tushar",7
SRH now have the second highest NRR lol,16
We're now #2 boys! let's not fuck this up,25
There could be a HUUGEE clusterfuck of 16 and 14 points this season,39
Iyer : *Deshpande leaked runs but he was our best batsman too*,47
"“I think we lost the game in the power play itself” -Iyer. 

Yes, with that attitude.",28
What was DC's NRR before this match?,3
[deleted],1
Iyer: This loss probably motivate us.,22
SRH.. sunrisers hospital,15
"Thank you, SRH. Hope y'all get into the top 4.",20
well there goes our 6.25% chance of breaking into the top 4,7
"If DC fans are sad today after losing 3rd match in a row, just remember that it could've been much worse if Bravo hadn't got injured before bowling the final over where DC needed 17 to win off it.",4
Poor Iyer he'll cry today when Pointing will bring his spring Bat,17
Shreyas literally crying like KL was in the first half of the season.,16
Yay RCB at #2. Will savour this for 24 hours before MI blast us into oblivion.,12
"Hey Iyer, next time please don't elect to chase no matter what the conditions are. Thanks.",11
He sounds like he's gonna cry,6
Well done Saha and the boys! Bairstow's career in tatters!,5
"POV you are Nadeem. One over, 8 runs and Stoinis wicket, would still be dropped next game.",13
"Well for a tie now, SRH have to win 2/2 and:

KXIP have to lose at least 1 AND KKR have to lose at least 1

OR

KXIP / KKR have to lose at least 1 AND one of RCB / MI / DC to lose 3/3 and 2/2 respectively

With the tie, I’m 99% sure we’ll get through because of our NRR. Actually winning the next 2 is the tough part though, let’s see",12
"I hope even if we lose, we dont lose by a huge margin so that we still remain at the top 2.",5
"""Higher they go, harder they fall, especially if they're not used to heights"" 
-cricbuzz delivering burns to DC lol.",56
[removed],22
"SRH with 7 losses and still with 2nd highest NRR, shows how comprehensive the wins were and how marginal the losses were.",37
"So if we win 2 matches and get 14 points and any team in playoffs just has 14 teams , then we will be into playoffs bois.",16
Good to see a top team getting their ass handed by an underdog. Well played👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😛😝😆,23
"Iyer, why is this guy in Indian T20 squad?",10
Man Iyer struggling to speak,9
Iyer's post match interview does not inspire confidence. Will be hard to win any more game if MI and RCB play their A-sides.,5
"*we’ll have a bowl*

When will these fucks ever learn!",11
"if srh had that win against kxip, we would be sitting at #4 with 12 points and +0.4 nrr",14
Abbe mere bhai you didnt win against Mumbai 😣,4
Pommie with some good probing questions there.,6
It will be funny when we win against MI and RCB. I still believe^^not,6
[deleted],22
Iyer likes to throw bowlers under the bus for leaking runs but does not say anything about his strike rate when it costs them a match,25
"[Ah, childhood memories!](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/scorecard/1082635/delhi-daredevils-vs-mumbai-indians-45th-match-indian-premier-league-2017)",5
Next match up for DC is against MI. Press F boys.,15
"Team| Points
---|---|----
RCB| 16/18
MI| 16
KKR | 14
KXIP| 14
DC| 14/16
RR| 14
SRH| 14


The fact that this is a possibility is fucking nuts

Actually my bad, either RCB will have 18 or DC will have 16, cant have RCB 16 And DC 14",21
"1)MI
2)KXIP
3)RCB
4)DC

thats my top 4",9
That NRR still just positive. But it reduces by -0.4 today. Damn,15
Srh with 2nd best nrr and 6th in points table.. thanks to choking middle order,18
Don't know about the field but Rashid's really humble in his interviews,27
Virtually every game now is a knockout.,11
"Rashid made a logical move of hiding his age. If he showed how old he really was, He would have been picked up by CSK!",100
So RCB vs MI winner will be the first team to qualify?,5
I will bowl better. Rashid not satisfied until he gets all 10wickets! Great guy!,19
Still an okay result for KXIP. Could have been worse if DC would have scored 40 odd more runs.,4
Srh fans asking us to repay - you’re welcome for kkr defeat,22
"At the rate which SRH players are getting injured, if they even qualify for the playoffs the playing eleven would consist of Thampi, Kaul and Khaleel",42
[removed],49
"Teams will not be confirmed even on 16 points, as five teams can get tied on 16 points. This IPL is super competitive.",36
I'm still laughing for Tushar 360 shot,52
Rashid is a real likeable bloke. Good for him!,41
Wtf I missed Warner bowling,34
3-7 is INSANE,26
Warner with 12 economy should be dropped next match.,76
"Provided srh wins their last two, csk can send us to the playoffs lol. They play both kkr and kxip",20
"Looking at the state of our batting, there's no way we're going to beat MI. Not sure how Shreyas is so confident.",20
The year China stops sponsoring the IPL is the year the teams at the point table are saying 'OUR IPL',19
The fact that we lost a Super Over to KKR and that game against Punjab. We could have been 2nd now :\,30
Is rr literally out of playoffs ?,10
"Hilights of the match
SRH opening partnership.
Warner bowling.
Siraj losing his record.
Dhawan staying loyal to SRH.
Rishab pant seconding the selectors choice.
Tushar leaking runs in both the innings.
DC thinking to open with Tushar next match.
Sanjay bangars commentary.
""AnY tEaM caN suprISe Any TeAM"" - Shreyas Iyer.
""I ShOulD haVe BoWLED beTtEr"". - Rashid Khan.
Rip DC's NRR.",45
Who's the guy in the purple blazer on regular comms,2
2 back to back pounding and still in positive NRR. Wow,7
"If MI wins against DC and RCB, DC vs RCB on the last day becomes a virtual knockout.",14
Holy shit. Look at DC's nrr. They are in real danger. Needs to win at least one of their last two.,21
"DC lose 3 back to back,

After the 1st loss, Iyer: Lots of learnings, I'm really happy this happened to us now instead of later

After the 2nd loss: Lots of learnings. I'm happy this is happening now

After this loss: This will really motivate us",67
I feel sad for Iyer just like I did for KL. You know Dhoni and Kohli definitely were far tougher characters than them when it came to handling defeats.,29
No post match thread?,6
DC and KKR gotta be the biggest jokes of this season.,27
Lol Unaccademy cr.....,9
"I have called out Iyer’s captaincy all tournament but it only takes loses for people to see the point lol.

Today we actually played shit to be honest but the man is not going to captain us to any win so it basically becomes a matter of the team winning without his captaincy which is hard you know!",17
"I saw Wriddhiman 36 yo Saha at a grocery store in Siliguri yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen hair serums in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the cream and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each cream and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Overall a nice dude. Love him.",22
One of these days at the post match interview Iyer will just sit down and cry,40
"As an SRH fan, ideal points table by this time next tuesday:

1)  MI - 18 points

2) KXIP -16 points

3) RCB- 16 points

4) SRH -14 points

5) DC -14 points

6) KKR -14 points",27
Someone pls meme Warner accepting max sixes award today vs last game.  Loool..,45
"Please Lord, if Finch plays tomorrow, he better not walk down the pitch every ball",12
Thanks SRH for the NRR.Very Cool.,20
"Rabada more like Kabada , Amirite guys? /s",16
Just tell me straight up how can MI qualify to top two!,2
Icarus Falls,2
i sincerely think indian players should participate in cpl/bbl just for the upliftment of the game and these match threads,19

"Saha doesnt even get man of the match. What a joke,",0
I find it amazing how dc walked all over csk and many other teams before but crumbled at 130 today,6
"As Kratos said

*Don’t be sorry, be better!* 

Our destiny is still in our own hands and if we don’t take it, then we deserve to be out of the tournament anyway.",16

Dhawan to SRH- Juda ho ke bhi tu mujhme kahin baki hai,25
"I fear srh will have tough time in sharjah where mishits off abd, polly and dick will be on flight to dubai....
Srh lacks those hitters in middle",16
DC lost 2 in 2 vs srh lol,19

Boult is gonna toy around with Finch like a serial killer tomorrow and then kill him brutally,15
Shouldn't MOTM price money be higher than the other awards,12
Eve Manish Pandey is injured? Man SRH can make an XI out of their injured players at this point.,31
"Warner showed , Time doe Finchy 😸",11
So probably no Shankar for the next game at least. Not that big of a loss with holder bowling four overs and Kane batting at no 4. But saha needs to be okay,18
"Did it for the team - W.Saha

Yes indeed ! Well Played champ!",26
"While chasing 220, if a team with players like hetmeyer, iyer, dhawan, pant wants to see your 4 overs off, you have reached the pinnacle of sport",44
Criminal that Rashid (4-0-7-3 Econ: 1.75) doesn't get an award,25
Its sad no one rates Saha. He made his international debut before Baitrstow still Bairstow is considered a bigger player than him.,25
"Also, with full disrespect, you are not going to win too many games if you let the likes of Narine and Saha smash you.",-14
Just commenting because i see a sea of SRH flairs,14
"We're gonna get fucked tomorrow aren't we

Still there is a sligghhht hope",14
"Did he just call Saha a young man? Lol, Saha is what 35-36 years old?",23
"Warner, in an off-season, is 3rd highest run-getter with 436 runs, 35 runs behind shika daawin",20
Oh and did you know that it’s Warner’s b’day today? /s,11
Has MI qualified?,3
"Kya Bhasad mach gayi hai points table me kuch samaj nahi aa raha kon in hai yaa out.

T - Unable to clearly see top 4 by looking at the points table.",11
Will DC become the 2018's KXIP?,16
"NRR itna hai hamare paas ki udhaar de de kisi aur team ko

t: We can lend some NRR to the needful",24
So Saha is now injured. 3D is definitely out of the tournament. Pandey walked off the field. At least I now have excuses if we don't reach Playoffs.,22
its not the loss but the effort put in during chase. DC is on a downward spiral and has 2 tough matches to go as well.,18
"Top 4:

mi, rcb, srh, kxip. if this doesn't happen, I will collect the snow from the first snowfall here in CN, mix it with my whey and drink it for six straight days",33

We have lost 3 in a row since then lol.",9
IPL should allow swapping South Africans for other players at the end of the tournament. It’s just so blatant at this point!,-10
"DC should bring back Prithvi. Though he is inconsistent, he can accelerate.",-1
"Lol at people trying to put blame on Iyer. DC is completely micromanaged by Ponting. Batting order today, Ashwin fielding at third man, Axar not coming against the left hander Narine in last match are all Ponting's decisions. Iyer is just a puppet more often than not. Same with Kumble at KXIP and Baz at KKR. Even at SRH, the trio of Moody, Murali and VVS always held more power than Warner or Kane. But at least, Warner and Kane had freedom with on-field tactics. Only Dhoni, Kohli and KKR-Gambhir were all powerful captains in IPL.",37
Srh has 2nd biggest NRR. Either we loose closely or win big.,24
[Every RCB fan at the decisive end of the tournament](https://youtu.be/5-sfG8BV8wU?t=78),3
YRKFA is so consistent that even 3-7 feels normal and nothing extraordinary,18
if u listen carefully iyer gives a lot of shit answers to almost any question,23
"I will settle for a broken TV report tomorrow for making peace with this shitshow.

https://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/broken-tv-exposes-ponting-rage/news-story/d96be239af0a976412b842023e98d88d for the uninitiated.",6
"16 points won't guarantee a playoff this time as 5 teams (DC, RCB, MI, KKR, KXIP) can end up tied on 16 points, then NRR will come into play. The earliest a team can confirm the playoffs is MI if they win both their games. A loss for either of KKR, KXIP will confirm qualification on 16 points.",13
Warner looking happy today,15
"DC🤝MI 

Making IPL interesting",17
"Might be a bit hard to swallow but Dhawan has had his run , and him not scoring is sheer downfall for DC...",10
Srh can qualify if they win both and punjab and kkr loses 1 each.,5
Guys what do you think it will finish like? Anything can happen. Genuine chance that RCB/DC could lose out and miss playoffs. There’s even a chance that RR can make the playoffs if they win their remaining games.,17
"My ambitions: smash every team we face.

Iyer ambitions: we have been looking for one win to qualify for the playoffs in the last 3 games.

Alright, I can see why the team is always disappointing to me now.",28
"I am mostly a pessimistic person but today I tried being optimistic and awarded ""hugs"" to this thread. Lo and behold everything turned out well for us.",25
So is Rohit going to play in  MI vs RCB or not?,2
"Can we talk about how rcb jumped to second place without playing a match, absolute mad lads",6
If we didn’t have any injuries (Bhuvi and Marsh) we would be top 3 right now,9
Srh has been a real roller coaster this season...choking easy wins against  RCB KKR KXIP to winning more than comfortably against erstwhile table toppers yesterday and RR,6
Keeping u/SinghSrb in my prayers. His confidence in humanity must have taken a hit after all this,8
Hi,1
Devdutt needs to be groomed for tests. Bring back elegance to batting.,2
