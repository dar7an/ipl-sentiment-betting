That girl is mentally disturbed and just spends her days looking at a screen and imagining things everytime that Covid news plays on her screen.

Ad number 1: she lives alone and has no friends. So she buys branded stuff on Ajio and wears it and posts her photos on social media and gets happiness or solace by looking at imaginary likes and emojis floating on her imaginary social media account.

Ad number 2: she looks at her screen and it triggers another round of disturbance in her head as she ends up buying a gift for the only person who seems like a friend to her, the liftman. 

Ad number 3: she is looking at the news again when it triggers memories of her mom who has passed a long time ago. So she buys another new dress on Ajio and pretends like her mom is still around and they're dancing together. 

The end.",16

I hate Ashwin and his ongoing milking of mankading for last 1 year to stay relevant. I hate Ponting's smirk even after they lose. I hate Prithvi Shaw's lack of temperament. I hate how no one in their batting order apart from Dhawan has stepped up to the challenge. I hate that they have 14 points. Thank you SRH for spanking them today. Please this is my sincere request to other clubs to pull them out of top 4 and show them their real place. God I hate them.,-11

• Iyer and Pant play a 10(9) and start accelerating. Get out after a couple of boundaries.

2020-10-27T17:15:33+00:00,CricketMatchBot,"**16.1** Sandeep Sharma to Pant, OUT, **big appeal for catch behind.** Umpire has signaled wide. Warner takes the review. It's a full ball dipping away wide outside off. He reaches out and looks for the drive through point. On early viewing, the bat has definitely hit the ground. There is a tiny spike on Ultra Edge as the ball goes past bat. The bat hits the ground a few frames after that. It's very close, a matter of frames. But the third umpire has gone on the evidence of sound and overturned the decision **103-8**

Dhawan
Rahane
Iyer
Pant
Hetmyer

2020-10-27T17:22:18+00:00,," T20 ISNT FOR SHREYAS IYER

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen hair serums in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the cream and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each cream and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
