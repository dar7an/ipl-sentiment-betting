2020-10-31T08:43:50+00:00,aryanx1234,"Ipl 2020 in layman terms:

1. Always bat first against dc, Make sure DC wins the toss so they lose the match

2. Always bowl first against rr

3. Keep 5 leg spinners in team against rcb (for ab)

4. Keep pandey on crease when u've set low target against srh

5. Let kxip cruise in the beginning for the choke at the end (plz atleast get gayle out)

6. Hope that the random batting, bowling generator is working for kkr when playing against them

7. Don't take so many wickets that jadeja comes to bat when playing against csk

8. Win super over by default against mi,  drop catches of Krunal when he is batting above Hardik/Pollard",107

Dc,rcb will most likely qualify because of positive nrr

For 4rth team

Scenario 1(highly unlikely): srh wins against rcb and mi

*Srh qualifies* regardless of other results because of nrr

Scenario 2: punjab wins against chennai 

*Punjab qualify* regardless of who wins in rr vs kkr

T20 is not for Shreyas iyer

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

The team they assembled at the auction was not good this time, or the last time. You already have decent Indian ""youngsters"" in your team who play fearless bold cricket, and you gave them the role of ""anchoring"" by selecting inconsistent openers. Last year it worked, because you were in India and the Indian players performed. This year, you needed aggressive overseas openers and you selected Stoinis and Jason Roy, both of whom could've opened. But no. Prithvi has frozen legs, Dhawan can only hit on the off and score runs in patches. And to top it off, even the bowling has begun to shit the bed.

Because DC is the weakest of all those teams, and we get to the Final right away..... Though .... not sure if that's even possible anymore with this drubbing by MI; their NRR is about to get much lower.

Only a few players on this team are threats. Shaw is garbage. Pant is mediocre. Iyer is a weak captain. Only 4 players really do work on this team: Dhawan, Stoinis, Rabada and Nortje. Get Dhawan out, and the rest of the batting order collapses. Their bowling core is pretty good between Rabada/Nortje/Ashwin, but their captain (Iyer) makes questionable decisions on when to put guys up. e.g. Axar getting smashed by Gayle in the power play when he should have put in Ashwin instead.",3

2020-10-31T12:16:33+00:00,hopeforhair,Unpopular opinion: The reason why captains save their strike bowlers for later is cos regardless of what the total is teams should always play to win and back themselves to somehow defend the total. Playing for NRR in a losing match does not provide sufficient returns. So they try to squeeze out the overs of their worst bowlers early on in the powerplay when the batsmen are not set yet. Of course this comes with the caveat that once the batsmen become set it will be difficult for the strike bowlers to get them out but imagine if the batsmen just plays out the strike bowlers. They can rain hell on the rest afterwards. Just my opinion any disagreements are welcome.,8
