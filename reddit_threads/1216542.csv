"Looking at RR's current, it would be really tough for MI/DC to beat them  in knockout. Moral of the story is peak late :P",1
All I want is a RCB MI qualifier,4
Halfway through the tournament I was hyped for this match but DC decided turn back into DD,16
I'm scared... :/,9
I hope DC wins,3
I back the underdogs in every match so let's go with Delhi today.,3
Will it be MI v DD or MI v DC today?,2
MI to win or else we riot,2
[My dream 11 team for the day. Jeez it is so hard choosing a captain in a MI game](https://i.imgur.com/6T9Q99U.png),2
"Being forced into supporting MI today, I hate you IPL!  /s",10
"DC please win(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

MI please lose(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ",8
"I have a feeling that since rcb is supporting us, mi will lose",31
Shaw Iyer Pant bc kch karo!,9
"Ipl 2020 in layman terms:

1. Always bat first against dc, Make sure DC wins the toss so they lose the match

2. Always bowl first against rr

3. Keep 5 leg spinners in team against rcb (for ab)

4. Keep pandey on crease when u've set low target against srh

5. Let kxip cruise in the beginning for the choke at the end (plz atleast get gayle out)

6. Hope that the random batting, bowling generator is working for kkr when playing against them

7. Don't take so many wickets that jadeja comes to bat when playing against csk

8. Win super over by default against mi,  drop catches of Krunal when he is batting above Hardik/Pollard",104
Hope DC brings in Shaw for Rahane. Not a big fan of Rahane over Shaw,3
Ngl I wasnt this nervous for my Math board exam,9
Can't wait to lose our 4th in a row yay,3
Imagine the scenes of both dc and rcb lose today,6
Which team should RR support?,3
"Mi has qualified

Dc,rcb will most likely qualify because of positive nrr

For 4rth team

Scenario 1(highly unlikely): srh wins against rcb and mi

*Srh qualifies* regardless of other results because of nrr

Scenario 2: punjab wins against chennai 

*Punjab qualify* regardless of who wins in rr vs kkr

Scenario 3: Punjab loses 

Winner of rr vs kkr qualifies

Things will change if any team loses by really big margins like delhi last game",7
5 teams fans supporting Mumbai today. What has 2020 done to y'all?,15
"Rcb fans who are supporting Mumbai today, I think it’d be better if Mumbai loses as it will give rcb a chance to go first if they win all their matches",5
"*Kab khaulega re tera khoon, Risabh Pant?*",8
"I wish we were playing DC and MI were playing SRH today, I feel like we can beat DC and safely go through and atleast not worry about being knocked out.

I am not optimistic about playing SRH because every crunch game with high stakes between us has gone in their favor, and they are in better form than we are. And the tendency of lower ranked teams to beat higher ranked teams in last few games.",4
"I think Shaw has been given enough time to think about his shortcomings, bring him back now please",21
Hope the team batting first wins,2
I hope MI plays it’s best squad today and wins to be guaranteed a top 2 finish and rests players for the SRH game instead.,4
MI should give a break to Bumrah and Boult as the team being in top 2 is settled anyway. Would also love to see Amolpreet and Mitch MCG get a chance.,-3
"So Delhi losing means even more chaos but I have a soft spot for Delhi

Such conflicting feelings",4
"Can't believe I'm saying this but... 

MI FTW!!!",3
"If DC and RCB lose today:

KXIP will qualify if they win against CSK

Winner of RCBvDC will qualify at 2nd position, while the loser would get eliminated (right away if by huge margin, later if SRH wins vs MI) 

Winner of KKRvRR will be the main contender for qualification, while loser will be eliminated

If SRH wins vs MI, they'll qualify at 3rd position. If they lose, loser of RCBvDC would qualify in case of KXIP losing vs CSK.",3
Let's go Mota boys.,5
"People are saying dc is doing reverse kxip, and that's bullshit

They're doing a kxip alright, a kxip 2018 that is",7
"Mi loses to rr so csk gets knocked out, csk wins so mi qualifies

Rcb hope mi win, mi fans will hope rcb loses (for more chaos in table)

We truly are ungrateful brats 😂",36
I want DC and RCB both to win today and qualify. 4th position should be KXIP. These teams have performed consistently and deserves it more than others. Hopefully this happens.,8
I hope we bat first today.,2
"Bring back Shaw for this game..He clicks, we win good, he fails, Rahane ain't doing wonders anyways..",9
Still not a do or die match for us. So I am hoping DC play it's natural game and try to push MI.,3
"If sky scores another good score, people will bring in koach without any reason and hop on the sky bandwagon

If sky doesn't score, some people who haven't seen his ipl stats for mi, will call him a ""one hit wonder"" and ""15 min fame""

Me? I just want to see sky play a scoop to rabada and play the good shots he normally does",31
[deleted],1
STAT: 200th IPL game for MI. First team to do so...,11
"Want Hetmyer to get a good knock today... looked good in patches, hopefully he can play a match winning innings for us",7
DC pls🙏,2
If DC lose today they'd be praying that SRH loses to RCB later in the evening right?,1
"Come on DC, I have full faith in you guys.",4
Good start. We lost the toss and will bat first.,4
"We have lost the toss, half the game won right there /s",8
Batting first step one done,3
[deleted],3
Imagine bowling first in a day game.,5
"Wow, strange decision for an Afternoon game... I was expecting MI to bat first.",1
"Mumbai should really announce the extent of rohit's injury tbh

There needs to be more communication between the IPL teams and the bcci",7
wow we are fielding first in an afternoon game? Damn the heat.,6
How's Pravin Dubey bowling?,1
"I am an idiot when it gets to this time of the IPL and figuring out qualification

Can someone explain what has to happen for RR to qualify",3
"Pravin dubey started this IPL as a net bowler for RCB, making his debut for DC today",7
Is it just me or Iyer comes off pretty arrogant?,2
"Hardik not playing, Shaw playing, Dubey playing oh my god it is happening everybody stay fucking calm stay fucking calm",13
Bruh what Mumbai should do next game is rest Bumrah and SKY.,6
Iyer looks really under pressure tbh,10
Lol Iyer was so confused at the toss there when asked about batting / chasing 😂,8
Axar dropped wtf,7
RAHANE DROPPED..... PRAISE THE LORD THERE IS HOPE FOR US TONIGHT,7
Wait I'm on cricbuzz and I can't see fuccboi in the team....is he actually not playing?,9
"No Lynn, Hardik resting, Coulter Nile playing... I am already fancying our chances ;)",7
"MI won the toss and are fielding first

Jayant yadav in for Hardik, NCN in for Pattison

Shaw in for Rahane, Harshal in for Deshpande, Pravin Dubey in for Axar",7
Delhi sent Rahane to the press conference yesterday only to bench him today. Ouch.,58
So glad Deshpande is out. How's Pravin Dubey though?,2
"They are never gonna play my boy Sandeep, are they?",4
"Hot Take- we had to drop an offie, so while being harsh on Axar we needed the leggie in",2
Scenes if RCB and DC loose today,6
Is hardik injured or is he just being rested?,1
Axar dropped and Jayant in are both tactical decisions due to LHBs in both teams.... Lets see how this pans out,6
Was hoping to see Sandeep Lamichanme in place of stoinis.,8
I wish I was that biscuit on Kanos,4
Axar out or Ashwin? Anyone confirm? How can cricbuzz know when Iyer didn't mention,2
Waiting for 5th November when I'll see full strength mi again (barring injuries),4
SHAW HAS SHAVED HIS HEAD.... THE REDEMPTION ARC BEGINS TODAY LETS GOOOO BOYS,24
Holy shit these team selections.,2
Loool at Rabada's pitch report 'its dry and carpety' :D,9
"Supported CSK last game. Supporting MI this game.

Ah, RCB, the things we do for you...",35
Axar is hard done by. He is a handy bat too. But hope Dube steps up,6
"> Jayant Yadav

That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.",17
"Unverified: Rohit is aiming to return back on Tuesday against SRH.

Edit: He'll most likely play last week of IPL. BCCI medical team will assess Rohit Sharma on Sunday and call will be taken whether he is fit to play in IPL.",11
Man I think we're gonna lose :'((((,3
man im just scared how many wickets rashid khan will take in the evening and how many balls to warner century,4
Is Axar injured? Don't think he'd be dropped after the kind of IPL he has had.,4
"Prepare your anuses, Delhi behnchods!",4
If you had told me Pant would be having SR of 115 this season.......,7
Jayant Yadav last played against CSK on Chepauk previous year iirc.,1
"WE'RE GONNA LOSE

AGAAAAAAAAIN",2
Is there a discount at bubble barber shop on getting bald look?,2
Pant 80(35) Today,5
Wtf dc dropped their best batsman?,1
Can someone explain why exactly Mumbai continue to play Saurabh Tiwary? Surely they have better bench strength than that?,6
Can someone tell by how much runs or overs should kkr and rr should win to overcome the nrr of rcb?,1
got a good feeling about today,5
Hopefully Pant fires today. Scoring against MI will give him much needed confidence.,8
"I've never been more pissed off with MI this season.

Firstly, why bowl first? I know teams batting second have won more games, but DC has one of the best bowling sides. Why not put the runs on the board and try to defend it.

If Hardik is rested instead of injured (hope not), it doesn't make any sense. I've never got behind this idea of resting players in a 14 game tournament. I know we have qualified, but we need to aim the top 2 spot. You don't rest your marquee player. Maybe i'm looking too much into it, but i'm really passionate about this team and would be disappointed if we don't make top 2 when the league stage ends.",8
u/zambur-e-bahar sorry mate but leave the reverse jinxing to professionals like us.,8
Does anyone know how long it’ll be before we see Rohit back?,2
Remember the time Pant whacked Bumrah like he was a gully cricket trundler? Seems to be centuries ago now.,6
Rabada’s classic 4-0-20-4 incoming bois,9
Why tf is Axar dropped,6
"Mi brought Dhawan in form when he scored 69 against us

Mi brought stokes and samson in form

Just to fuck everyone else next in line 😂

Edit: mi please bring pant in form, **looks at rcb with malicious intent**",19
Qdk 100 coming bois! Mark my words,2
Shocking decision to field first when it is known we can’t chase 160+ and have crumbled badly chasing in the last 2 games.,2
That is a very convenient side that Delhi should have no trouble beating. We're missing 2 of our star players.,2
"I feel bad for Dhawan, feels like he has a lot to do for his team on his own",3
I really hope Mi pull through today so it becomes easier for Rcb to finish top 2,2
Is axar injured? He didn't do any wrong to get dropped,3
"Seems like MI have understood that having DC in the playoffs will be good for them. 

Resting Hardik pandya in this match shows how much importance they give to this match.",2
"Mi playing with 1 less batsman, their trust on sky is immense.",2
They selected Shaw for his performance on Carpety pitch. Amazing!,7
Why is Hardik not playing?,2
SKY vs Iyer ~~tonight~~ today,4
"Drop Shetmeyr, bring Ponting at #3 

*S T O N K S*",22
Can Prithvi score more than he misfields? Find out in the next episode.,23
I'm happy we're batting first but also scared cause MI is really good at chasing.,3
"I think after rr steamrolled us to get 195, I don't think pollard will ever bat first in this tournament",8
So which opener gets a golden duck today?,-1
"Every tom, dick and harry here thinks theyre better coaches than RICKY FUCKING PONTING FFS..... WhY iS AXaR DrOPpEd?? ITS TACTICAL YOU JOKERS",1
Logically who should srh supporters be supporting here,1
"Pant 13(18) today or 68* (22)?


No in-between.",3
"Kinda odd they chose to chase isn't it, It's against Delhi who's known to be shit at chasing and it's an afternoon match...",3
It's in MI's best interest to throw this game away,1
Feel so happy for Dubey was just a net bowler 2 3 weeks back and now is playing in an IPL game. Go good Dubey!,5
All days matches in Dubai have been won by the team batting 2nd. Hence Mumbai choosing to bowl first.,1
"If you need to ask Rohit to blush will you say, 'Rohit Sharma'?",9
MI bois who do you prefer playing in the qualifier? RCB or DC?,3
"Mahela Jayawardene v Ricky Ponting

Mahela was the captain of a successful DD/DC in 2012 and Ricky Ponting was the initial captain of MI in 2013.

Now, they're succesful coaches for the opposite teams.",9
I swear to god if mi loses this.....,9
NRR experts - How badly should Delhi lose today for their NRR to slip below Punjab?,6
"Was dubey the replacement for Mishra? 
And if yes when did he arrive to Dubai and do his quarantine?",3
"Another DC game, another chance for SunnyG to say ""Pant has been removed."" on national television.",78
"MI looks weak without hardik , Pattinson and Rohit. Best chance for DC to win this match",8
"Between MI and RR, who has the scarier top 6?",2
Any delhi fans out today or is it all the punjab/srh/rr fans lurking for us to bottle it again? 😅,2
is Dube and Dubey spelt the same in Hindi,5
How much do you think Deep Dasgupta was paid for the MyTeam11 (or whatever it's called) ad?,6
If both DC and RCB lose today there's a very real chance of one of them to be knocked out.,5
"After yesterday's match :- DC - we live to die another day

RCB - Then we'll die together",5
MI look so calm :(,3
Yessssss no Rahane!,1
Can you see this comment?,1
"It's dubai??

Well congrats on the win dc",2
Less go Dhawan-Shaw,2
We'll be terrible in the PP,2
Tbh it fairs well that we are batting first.,2
Bc sleeper cell shaw back in the team,2

"Dhawan is a great batsman, but he is such a coward. Never in his life has he taken the strike first ball and even gets a young inexperienced guy to take the strike smh",-1
Hardik isn't playing and I'm not even worried.,3

Aaaaak I can’t watch this match live for a bit but woah,3
Well we had a good run,2
ISS NOT OUT,4
"Looks safe, ciao Dhawan.",1
Shaw transferred the curse to Dhawan.,8
Trent Boult in the 1st over is a beast.,9
"Catches took in this match, SKY - 1 Kohli - 0",44
He has caught it right in first place but it seems it just touched the ground later on MAYBE,3

We always start games with one down. Nothing to worry about right...? Ugh.,7
Fucking dominant start.,3
lol now time for the real Delhi openers,2
Third umpire has such a commanding voice,3
Is it just me or is this game abnormally quiet?,3
2 wickets in first over? 🤔,4
What happened to DC suddenly why they are playing like this,8
"**0.3** Boult to Dhawan, OUT,  **1-1**

S Dhawan c SA Yadav b Boult 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",3

Shaw bhi out hone waala hai,3
Looks like Shikhar has realised that IPL is not an ICC tournament,11

"Can we get a punter face cam the whole game?

Wicket looking like my society's playground,3
Pressure building already :',3
"Why can't MI just give an update on Rohit Sharma, it just unethical. MI are the most balanced team in this IPL, this kinda tactic doesn't help them in anything and really hate these diplomatic answers that pollard gives about Rohit (I'm sure it's not his fault and the management's words). Bcci needs to do something about this. The franchises should never get the feeling that thier above national boards. There needs to be an action against MI management",12
I love ya smile Boulty!,5
Boult has now more wickets than archer in PP.,8
Delhi Daredevils back in form.,74
"Okay, so we're already off to the worst possible start.... Greeeaat.",8
FFS can't one of the teams change their kit to a contrasting colour? Annoying to see two teams with identical clothes.,10
"So, you're telling me if Shikhar opens his account it's only to score a 100",76

Was that out? Looked as if the ball touched the ground,8
Smiling Boult is the best Boult.,9
"With batting as fragile as DC's around him, I think it's a bit unfair to expect Iyer to play like SKY. We should wait and see how he does when he has KL, Rohit and Kohli around him.",7
Man this is depressing,8
Is Hardik injured?,1
Bruh what the fuck is this Dream 11 fan wall 😂,2
Do not tell me that Hardhit is injured,2
boult is adorable,6
Everyone on the fan wall looks dead inside,2
So stupid of Delhi to leave Boult. He was solid for them last year.,2

How do I contact the guy in the truck for a uno reverse ? Asking for a friend,3
"DC will regret releasing

Boult

"Prithvi ain't flat, prithvi gol hai",4
Talk whatever you want about Shaw but he is a genuinely aggressive player and exactly what we need in the PP,8
Prithvi Sehwag,4
Why is NCN back? Mclenaghan is an option too.,3
his name is **Lovesh**,1
Shaw has no footwork. Sehwag had no footwork but he was Sehwag.,4
I hope Bumrah gets the over after Boult. DC aren’t at their best right now and early wickets will shake their confidence even more.,4

Good to see Jayant Yadav again. That Pune test really fucked his career.,4
Jayant now! Really good bowler IMHO. MI really know how to build a team.,6
Is this the guy who hit 100 vs england and had bradman average but was still dropped ?,1
So hear me out guys. I have this suspicion that Shaw didn't actually get banned for over the counter cough syrup but an illegal hairline retaining drug.,8
Vov Pant really wants to get out,2
Wtf Pollard? bring Bumrah and destroy them.. what is this defensive mindset,4
"now, this is just depressing",4
Relief for de Kock,2
"Mi is too OP fam. Best pace lineup, best best domestic players, best allrounders/finishers, decent spinners.",3
Wtf was India's test opener doing FFS,2
"There has been talk of how india plays T20s like ODIs with players like Virat, Iyer and KL not realising having players like Pant, Shaw and Pandya means they are gonna be inconsistent on paper with low average but high strike rate. Two way sword this 😞",10
"Our batting lineup is absolute shit, overrated because Indian but they are garbage in clutch positions",8
We have completely lost our game now,5
BC atleast attack against spinners,3
"Delhi peaked too early: Unmukt Chand

Delhi Chands",18
Watch this Jayant yadav guy win for MI today.,5
"Whenever Pant is on strike -


De Kock is behind Pant.",8
Is it only me or anyone also thinks either RCB or DC won't make it to playoffs.,4
RR pls give us Ben Stokes,1
"I don't have anything against Jayant Yadav, but I feel like Anukul Roy should have been given a chance today because he's been really good in the field. Ik the logic is mot sound but whatever",1
Wow. Watching Jayant play after a long time,1
This embarrassment of a team doesn't deserve the playoffs. If and when we lose this one and the game against RCB can both KXIP and RR both make it?,3
Since when did we have 3 spinners lmao,1
how is this mi team always winning? someone please stop them,1
"Prithvi, Shubhman they all need to work on how to handle short balls better.",4
These bowlers... They might be Jayants,2
Dc batting line up is like indian media you force them to bend they end up crawling.,5
Pant is really justifying his test selection,-2
Shaw talks about his pubic beard more than the time he stays on the pitch.,1
Nice to see Jayant getting games. Loved him in the Ind v Eng Test series in 2016. Haven't seen much of him since.,7
"All of a sudden, DC's lineup isn't looking all that good",10
"Dc's next match is against rcb 

So one of them will definitely qualify 

If rcb loses both will qualify because nrr",9
I heard something,3
I remember  Jayant yadav  had a big match against Australia and they were calling him Giant,5
haa jaan le lo meri,6
"Take it polly, or else Boult will go in denial",11
"Felt like there was communication gap between Shaw and Iyer/Ponting he was just told "" Prithvi you are playing today"" and you could see he was rushing through his overs like he wanted to prove he's back to form inside 1 over.",4
Lol if this is out...,1
"P Shaw should be the brand ambassador for Dream 11.


Batting hum karlete hain, aap jaake Dream11 pe team banake aao.",6
C'mon third umpire! Give it AAOOOUUTT!!,-1
First time I'm seeing Jayant after his test century.,8
Dude bad review,11
Bruh,5
Last time boulto appealed like this it was out and wasn't reviewed,12
I didn't hear anything but Iyer looked guilty for some reason,18
Faak no spike on the graph. Bleh.,3
MI trolling koach,14
Wasting a Review 101,9
Appeal kari nahi review le lia,7
THANK GOD,5
Wtf is this review,5
Lol ambani late payment for CGI Snicko,11
De Kock is deaf,11
The only thing that was retained was Boult's confidence,14
DC just doesn't have that spark. Last year they were playing to win we saw the fight even in their lost cause in playoff. This year they just doesn't look that much interested.,5
"I wont be surprised if Delhi goes out and Punjab, Rajasthan qualify.",3
"I will have Mayank and Gill opening in OZ, thanks!",6
"Beamrah not even bowled yet, rip DC",7
"Pollard fielding at backward point gives me flashbacks of the time when he dropped 3 in 3 off Johnson.


Remember?",7
I thought I heard something though.,3
open with Stoinis he carried the Melb. Stars in the BBL,3
"India's young talents come in two variations.. the ones like Shaw, pant who can't take singles and the ones like gill and Iyer who only deal in singles",11
I was at the Wankhede when Jayant Yadav score his century. The batsman at the other end also did well.,6
Bumrah is waiting in the wings.,7
This bowling lineup is so smashable outside of bumrah. Need to keep wickets in hands and play bumrah well,-5
DC really searching and Bumrah still to come in. They'll need Hettie and Stoinis to crank it up to pull this off now,2
"Prithvi has clearly been a hit or miss, will this IPL affect his career?

ps: I know he is young.",5
I swear I heard it. DC=ICC=BCCI=PIG3,2
DC peaked at the wrong time,7
BC at least score some runs,5
"Hope RCb and Delhi wins today. 

Dc doesn't look good by looks of this match",6
Just saw the score. Shaw you absolute bunny.,15
Pollard hasn't even bowled yet. Rip dc,5
I'm not sure if Shaw will succeed in Aus tests considering the way he plays pull shot like a hoick everytime. I hope i'm proven wrong though.,5
PredictViz says DC will score 147 today.,2
"Delhi self destructing

Og Delhi fans : I know this feeling..",7
[deleted],100
"If you don't bring Bumrah when DC is vulnerable, it would've been better to rest him and play Dhawal.",7
DC should just start  opening with Pant and Iyer now FFS,10
"You know that interesting fact that every match that Delhi won had a different MotM?

We were taking that as a positive thing but that in fact hid a very glaring issue. 

Every time one or the other player saved our asses. Not happening anymore.",8
This DC team is done. Batting pitch and you're 19-2 after 5. lmao,7
"They were thinking about that missed knick a few games back where Boulty was adament but MI didn't review.

They were always going to review this one.",6
So who exactly is MI saving Bumrah for.?,9
I hope Indian t20 players stop anchoring unnecessarily in international t20 matches and go for it at least from ball 10 if not 1 when they arrive. 12 of 10 is okay but 22 of 20 not.,7
"genuinely though, what's changed with us?",5
"Rohit such grat captain.
Even no on field still captaining from dugout

That why he has so many trophy, and choker koli has none.

/S",10
"Ye Pant ko drop karo, khelna bhool gaya ye",5
Jayant Yadav was also a trade from Delhi. So was Sherfane Rutherford.,5
Template Delhi batting. I don't know what they are thinking. Do they really think there par score of 160 will help them in win against inform Mumbai?,8
Thala Pant 1(6). Look how they massacred my boy,8
Scott Styris reminding us how our batters shat bed in NZ 😭😂😭😂,5
Young exciting delhi team with 4.9 RPO RR 🤯🤯,9
[removed],3
Jeez the commentators are instilling real paranoia about Shaw’s prospects down under.,3
Why send pant early if you want him to play like this ffs. He can't rotate the strike all that well,2
"_Young, Indian, Fearless_",6
RCB is rooting for MI today right?,8
DC were lucky to escape against CSK. No wonder their true level is being exposed here,3
How long till Iyer hits a six at long on.,2
3.5 run rate in powerplay,2
Where is bumrah 😑😑,4

"At start of the tournament, people ran behind my life as to why i have this flair, only to see half of Delhi supporters changing their flairs to DD now😣",5
Did something happen to Pant? Looks different than what he was down under,8
Iyer is actually a good player of spin. He gets dismissed against them only when he gets overconfident.,4
What is the lowest powerplay score in IPL history,4
<4 RPO ... I don't care if 2 wickets are gone. This is terrible batting.,4
"19 for 2 and our Best bowler yet to come. Wow, Chahar NCN and Bumrah left too",6
Boy! DC dealing in dots now😢,5
Arre wah single lelia nice going Bois.,4
"Boult was a great buy for MI 
 
They lacked a wicket taking option at the top and Boult is one of the best in the world with the new ball",7
Koach - my singles and doubles don't look so bad now do they,6

You love to see it",3
God dammed wtf with this tuk-tuk. At least shows us you're trying.,3
BC test match hai kya,2
What time is the tea?,4
MI making sure Lynn cannot win matches for other teams,4
"Wow, and we haven't even bowled Bumrah yet.",10
DC think this is a Test?,4
[deleted],6
"Ummm, so is Jayant a spinner or a medium pacer or perhaps koach style medium spin?",3
"Jayant Yadav is kinda bowler Sehwag used to smack him for 6,4,6,6,4,6",7
Jayant plays at least one match every year for MI. Ek match to khelta hi hai.,2
DC: I am the KKR now,4
They are completely destroying Pant's natural game. Hetmyer is perfect for this position. Pant perfect at 5/6,3
"Because of Tendulkar's fairy tale story Indian cricket has kept on giving these 19-20 year olds chance at the international level directly.

Consistent first class performers get shadowed by these so called prodigies.",21
75 projected score lmao,14
And the selection committee thought Shreyas shouldn’t be selected for tests.,6
If Pant had a 6 pack he'd probably need new pants,5
"“Pant can’t fill in Dhoni’s shoes.”

_Pant 2* (7)_ bitch please!",17

projected score 75 💀,9
"Shaw and Pant need to grow the fuck up, they arent getting any younger and it seems they still haven't found their secret sauce",6
Lol I last saw poor Jayant Yadav in 2018 tests . Sad that he can’t break into the test team in Indian conditions,4
A CSK worthy powerplay,9
Is this the lowest PP score this year?,5
"We're absolutely fucking up the powerplay, this team is so lacking in confidence",1
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO PANT,4
How many wickets for Bumrah today?,2
"I know MI is the deserving team to win the trophy this year but if some other team holds their nerves and perform well to win the finals against MI, I won't be complaining.",4
Well 1st session to the bowlers. The batsmen can make merry in the second session. (Batsmen will belong to a different team though),3
66 in 18 overs here we gooooo,5
22 for 2 at the end of powerplay. Long way to go but we got this fam.,5
Having an extra bowler means we now have 4 Bumrah overs intact.,3
Can't stand dugout wanking over the Altroz,2
lmao DC's form going to utter shit has made the playoffs race so much more spicy than it needed to be. At this rate they're the most likely to crash out.,4
[deleted],5
Is there a chance of one of DC or RCB not making top 4?,3
Imagine Pant and Iyer batting in a test match together!,3
Bad time for Dhawan to be not ICC Dhawan,2
"Yikes this feels like a test match for real. Bright ass sun, empty stadium, quiet as fuck, batsman playing like this and field placements...",7
"Stop criticising Pollard for not bowling Bumrah. 

He's probably making sure spinners get 1-2 overs under 6 RR before death/non powerplay overs.",9

Test Match chalu hai kya bc,2
"Is the DJ playing ""Pinball Wizard""?",1
Nothing is better than seeing Tiwari running.,4
Mujhe aur kuch nhi dekhna. Bas Pant Bumrah ka ek over pel de,3
My boss would have fired me if I had performance like Shaw,4
Chahar not gonna bowl today huh,5
"Fifty years from now, kids will learn about “Jio Fiber Movement” in their history class",6
Bring on bumrahhhh,2
Wtf what are DC doing?,5
Either we’re aggressive and reckless or safe and conservative to the extremes. Really hard to watch right now.,6
"Chup kar Bangar, tere bass ki nhi",1
"Unbelievable, batting at 3 and a bit after the powerplay and Bumrah hasn't even shown up yet",5
"I miss the old Pant

The throw the kitchen sink at everything Pant

The swing himself off his feet Pant

The hit boundaries for fun Pant",11
Surprised that not many here know Jayant Yadav. Scored a century against England in test just four yrs ago.,7
WTF is Ponting telling Pant? He's like a totally different player this season,8
"BC this powerplay where are the boundaries as an Mi fan, I am feeling bored.",2
I hope this tuk tuk will be followed by bang bang later. Else goodbye 2020 IPL.,3
 Fuck your music box on wheels,2
"Genuine Question to Mumbai Fans, how does it feel to be a fan of a team which hs one the Cup 4 times?",3
"You cant be knocking aroud offies, for singles, in powerplay",2

"Have to absolutely smash this over, pandya is a garbage bowler",2
"'sensible' Pant sucks

Why did people have to ruin him",6
LMAO even Sanjay is joining in the altroz action. Love it!,2
MI didn't spend an over of NCN and Bumrah and Delhi is at 24 oof,9
"DC should play out today

Tomorrow they can accelerate after tea session",16
now even the batsmen jogging is pissing me off,3
"mi still has bumrah, chahar and ncn

&#x200B;

holy fuck",3
"Everyone wanted Pant to be the next Dhoni, and in this IPL he is playing really like Dhoni of late. 

I wish the aggressor Pant turns up!",7
Dart player Krunal with a punchable face bowling early today,-1
DC is making sure they don't qualify,8
Second lowest poerpplay score of the season. Behind KKR's 17 for 4 against RCB.,4
Bc itne bekaar he hum kya? Middle of the bat se single bhi nahi aarha,4
Projected score 77 lmao.,8
Shit DC dropped Axar? That's a bonkers move. Isn't this game a must win for them?,3
Pant practicing for Aus Test tour a bit early.,7
What happened to Dhawan? Back to back ducks.,1
[deleted],9
The worst part is that we don't know how to get out of holes. Whenever there's pressure we take way too long to get going,5
2018 Pant is what we need,3
My take on Pant is I am not worry about his form it's his fitness he has gained 10 Kilograms in lockdown . If you are fit and failing you just have to work on your Batting no one blames Dhoni's fitness for getting runout in Semis. Imagine if Pant's gets run out in 2021 T20 WC semis. 😞,6
Atleast run doubles. Killing the game already,2
Jayant is here to reinvent his career as a powerplay bowler. He did nothing wrong when he was given a chance in the test squad. The game has changed and the modern tactics are especially hard on old school players like him.,2
Can someone explain what Delhi is doing? Why push it around for singles? It doesn't make any sense...unless.. I mean what else could it be?,3
So Rabada should open for DC now,3
"Ponting has absolutely destroyed our boi Panty.

Just in time for our series down-under, where Pant was our 2nd best batsman.

Aap chronology samajhiye.",7
Is the Altroz a meme among dugout commentators? I can't understand why they keep mentioning it. I wish they laughed more openly than how they're doing now; it's a shame they have to mention sponsors this frequently.,2
Should've sent Stoinis in at 3 again tbh,3
Chokehold activated.,5
Show punters face lmao,3
Didn't know Jayant Yadav was playing IPL until now,2
"Just logged in,why is Hard-dick not playing?",4
The lower half teams on the table look deadlier than the top teams in the tournament now,5
"Delhi Capitals are evolving

Delhi Capitals have evolved into **Delhi Daredevils**",5
"Pant was a serious talent when he came into the team. Had the skills to score a century in England and had the T20 mindset that the international team lacked.

I genuinely think that all the coaches and pundits calling him reckless and careless has led to his slump in form.",2
Humble guy DC just trying to get a negative NRR to open up the playoff spots even more,6
"28 in 7 overs, plain awful",3
okay missed the game till now... so is the pitch not a batting friendly pitch? or we are just batting shit?,1
They both will play so many dot balls and when they'll start firing they'll get out.,2
Finally runrate of 4 after 7 overs. We may move into ODI mode by 15th over.,3
Went at run a ball in one over and the RR actually increased. Wow,3
DC would be staring down the barrel if Bravo hadn't got injured and Mayank had made that 1 off 3 that infamous day,3
"Congrats BCCI, you broke Pant!!

Good Job!",0
Krunal is so fucking economical it's almost unbelievable.,3
"Can we trade Warner with SRH for Shaw, Rahane and Mohit Sharma?",2
"Itne run toh Ishaan Kishan ek over mai bana lega

T: Ishan Kishan will score this much in just an over",3
Good batting. Lets not lose wickets till tea. After that they can look for a boundary every over.,5
Is Delhi doing a favor to Kohli?,2
Wow koach's quick doubles ™ don't look bad now,5
"Govinda's Cred app is the best imho.

Fuckin legend,chichi",3
Gazab Tiraskaar hai,1
They are not even attacking Krunal? Wtf!,3
Pollard sneaking a few spinner overs here.,5
Someone should tell them this ain't a test match.,5
What was our position in the PP in th SRH Pant 128 innings. Anyone remembers?,2
These people have let an offspinner get away with 2 overs for 6 runs.,5
Harshal Patel can bat lot better than DC top 5,3
You know if Krunal wasnn't any good at cricket he would have been Hardik's manager hustlin',2
Do a 49 all out harakiri already. Save us from this tourcher.,2
Where is Bumrah?,4
"Feel like DC are gonna convince themselves this is a slow pitch, aim for like 150, get like maybe 130-140 while trying and then convince themselves it's a good score on this pitch and then MI are gonna come out and knock it off with like 4 overs to spare.",5
Oh hey theres rugby on. Who knew,3
Jeez this is more painful to watch than some of CSK's initial chases,2
Perfect for Iyear. No one will bkame him  for playing his natural game here.,1
"Pant and Maxwell have the same problem. They overhit everything when they try to get boundaries which is why the lack of consistency. Players who do well can score boundaries with normal shots, without swinging wildly.",2
Shotttttt,3
What a strike,3
Jayant 2-0-6-0 wtf,2
The CRED ads are not bad actually. They just get irritating because ads are repetitive in ipl,4
"Fucking finally

Shot Iyer",3
"Bumrah/NCN next over.

Edit : called it!",1
Who said Iyer will hit a 6 over long on?,2
What a shot though!,3
"Good, 5 more please",1

Iyer pls cunt them THANKYOU,3
Please DC get absolutely Effed,3
RR 4 before that six. Wow!,3

From the run up I thought it was Coulter-Nile bowling gentle medium pace for a second.,2
"Pant now don't waste any more ball in this over, take a single atleast",3
At times I feel Bhogle is a bit of a chutiya. Love him. But he is too stupid at times.,-2
Get Bumrah in already,3
Jayant yadav has more test centuries than iyer will ever have,6
Bunch of pussies.... What a letdown from DC,3
These two can't even up the run rate later after getting set. Should have sent Stoinis at 4.,1
Get to 65-70 off 10 overs please,3
Rohit has taken over Mota Ambani in giving facial expressions after every shot. How symbolic ❤️,16
Inb4 shreyas and pant's century.,4
Why are we playing like we are 5 down.,5
Where's bumrah guys? Will he bowl today or not?,3
Tiwary is such a misfit in MI.,3
"At the risk of feeling the collective wrath of r/cricket, looks like MI doesn’t really need Rohit in their squad and they are still super strong.",11
I hate what they've done to our Pant.,15
Like the idea from the MI think tank to try 3 Trent overs right at the start. He's been superb up front and less so at the death.. so this might be a good option going forward.,7
"DC playing bad today cuz they know they'll bring out their A game vs RCB

*pain*",5
[deleted],6
Do these twats know there's 4 overs of bumrah left?,3
"Pollard did this 2 matches ago as well. Instead of bringing in the Strike bowlers to take more wickets, he let's the opposition bat until death overs. 

Not sure if he's Treating these as practise matches.",3
Swann is spot on,2
5 overs for 28 between Krunal and Jayant is a win for MI.,8
Dc hellbent on not going to playoffs,8
Next over 15 runs,3
Can RR sneak in to the playoffs just to beat MI?,12
Mi giving bumrah fielding practice.,6
Lmao no wonder they're playing like this.... Batting ends at 6 and Bumrah is yet to come. RIP DC,3
"Dhoni took 12 years to go from Boom Boom to tuk tuk.

Credit to Pant. He has managed that transformation in just 12 months",12
WTF is this IG Reels ad. Are they promoting stupidity?,5
"I thought Pant would hit a 6 cause Iyer took one on, guess I was wrong",2
I am beginning to think Delhi may fail to qualify from here. Bumrah and Chahar yet to bowl. Slightly positive run rate that could be knocked into negative today. RCB winning today might give them a chance as RCB-DC match wont be a do or die for both teams,10
"Honestly Pant just say fuck you to everyone wanting him to ""curb his instincts"" and just play his natural game. It's when he looks his best even if there's a risk of him getting out early.",8
Lord Bumrah is yet to bowl. DC are going nowhere,7
why do jayant yadav's deliveries look like they take 15 minutes to reach the batsman!?,8
F1 fam where you at,4
"At this rate, dont think Pant can pass the yo yo test",7
bring in fuccboi in for tiwary and mi looks fucking solid (can't decide between ncn and pattinson),2
"Out of 12, 4 overs are of Bumrah. Good luck DC",5
I hope NCN is back to his best today. He has looked real rusty so far.,1
NCN should bowl out before 16th. He is going to get hit if MI save him for death.,2
"4 overs of Bumrah, 4 of NCN, 1 of Boult still remaining. And on top of that, 1 of Pollard too.",6
wtf Bumrah,2
"0 wickets for Bumrah today.


Overrated.",10
"Pant is so worried about his wicket, he is not going aeriel at all. My disappointment is immeasurable and my entire day has been ruined",11

I really hope it's Bumrah's off day today,4

Y'all gotta shut up. They lost two wickets early and they have just two more batsmen. Atleast this way they can get upto 130+,8
They will have to attack Chahar or Bumrah.,6
I'm still mad about Delhi changing their name to Capitals. Delhi Daredevils had a vibe to it.,10
"If you guys remember, Pant absolutely smacked Bumrah when DC faced MI couple of years ago.",2
"They fed him in leg side, he cashed in.

Teams are smarter now.",4
Projected score 98. And Pant is looking to defend still after playing 13 balls. FFS I would prefer a quick death,4
Sharp bouncer,2
Can't believe they deny my bum the new ball,4
Iyer and pace on the ball,3
Can't believe he's the same guy who used to f*ck Bumrah,1

Tuk tuk Pant in 2020:",65
Theoretically they wouldn't need to turn to NCN with the spinners doing a containment job. They will give him a couple of overs I think.,4
Shreyas is feeling a little gassy today so he called for a 'strategic' time-out.,4
So where/when do you think DC goes bang bang? How long till Pant and Iyer settle in? Over 12 onwards?,6
Jayant Yadav's international career has been quite weird. He did well in the opportunities he got in tests but nobody thinks of him while thinking of tests.,7

"Since it's Halloween, the only explanation is that Pant is going to take off his mask and reveal that he was Dhoni all along?",11
What do you call tuk tuk Rishabh Pant with a lot of talent and potential? Rishabh Thalanth,5
Why bowl Bumrah and break this amazing test partnership,4
JSW Pant lmao,4
Just realized why these two are playing this way. They know Hetmyer is hit out or get and won't last more then 10 balls. Same for Stoinis he hasn't been good in after good knocks in initial game and after him a long tail follows. This means if they also get out they will surely gonna have 49 all out. Apparently DC has lot of trust in their top two if that fails their backup plan is these two will play like this till 15 over. So that they have 130-140 on board.,3

Ponting is looking so pissed off....,5
Ricky putting on that fake smile for the interview while he's seething inside lmao,6
Delhi are so hilariously bad right now. As a Delhi fan I've found comfort in pretending like this match is a circus performance. Atleast then I dont have to take them seriously.,2

Pant go full blastoise now dont get that responsibility shit for the entire innings now,5
"Delhi's biggest disadvantage is that Shreyas Iyer never counterpunches. He's always happy to play if safe and get to 28(30) even before moving up one gear. Pant's new avatar has made it worse. You have a number 3 and number 4 who are willing to take zero risks. You're not gonna win too many matches like that. 

They just need to look at SKY and Ishan Kishan and what they've been doing. Both of them have walked in at tough situations but have never been afraid to take on the bowling. You don't have to strike at 150, the least you can do is at least go at 120.",9

Honestly DC were such a settled team in the first half of the tournament and now it looks like they've completely lost their way forcing lot of changes. Not a good sign in the final phase of the tournament,6
Pant and iyer really justify their place in team india?,2
Yeah eat all the balls and then suddenly start playing stupid shorts.,4

Imma rage if Shreyas tries to play such shots while representing India,3
This bowling attack is just illegal.,4

1. He has always been throwing his bat at the ball off balance which is much less effective when the boundaries are longer. He might be unstoppable in Chinnaswamy next year even if nothing else changes

2. First year is always good for any explosive batsman.. then the bowlers figure him out and he has to work on his  weaknesses to be effective again in international cricket

3. He has always been a 30 odd runs player.. earlier he used to score 30 odd runs from 15 balls and get out.. now he scores the same 30 odd runs from 25 odd balls and throws his wicket.. atleast he has been consistent that way",1

Well at least we got past 49 I guess....,4
"MI always has a champion aura. 

DC looks deflated already",9
" 

T20 is not for Shreyas iyer

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

Today's poll

Most exciting DC player

Who won?

Shreyas freking iyer with 44% Yeah very exciting singles",10
Can we keep this team forever?,2
Unless Stoinis goes big biceps mode and 13 an over here we lose this,2
What the hell was that shot?,4
Kohli and Shastri asking Pant to not play his natural game is going to make Pant the Irfan Pathan of this generation is they don't check themselves.,4
I wouldn't retain Shreyas at all. Such a disappointment.,3
De kock behind stoinis is how all my fan fics start,6
This is the reason you shouldn't try to play like odi in T20. You do not have 50 over to survive. If you eat 12 over and then get out. Lower order can't do jack shit.,2
"If Pant doesnt counterattack, we are still done😭",1

Smelli Crappitals,1
aw god not THISSSS,1
Fuck me for thinking DC will win IPl this season.,1
What is it with this match.. Lack of intent or MI Too good,2
Will they reach 84 tho?,1
"Off topic- when franchises retain players at the auction, do they pay them the same price that they were initially bought for ?",1
Now where are the people who were shitting on RCB for releasing Stoinis?,3
The signs don't look promising at all for the Australian tour. 2 of the probable top 7 are completely out of form and out of shape as well.,2
Should I close my TV right now. Or wait for more torcher from DC? Guess what they do not have replacement in their team. It is nice we have auction next year. It all over for us this year.,2
"LMFAO  


The last recognized batting pair at the crease.",6
Don't mind hearing tunak tunak though,2
"Given the dream run till now, MI are gonna go through half hour of brainfade in playoffs/final and concede the title to some unlikely team.",8

Has any team ever been this dominant in IPL before?,4
"Is there any point in playing the tournament any longer? Mumbai are almost unbeatable even while resting key players. To beat them you either have to win a super over or two or get someone to pull off a freak performance (like Stokes the other night)

Bumrah looks like he’ll get the purple cap now.",7
"Bruh scenes if Delhi dont make the play offs

I live for moments like these",5

India now produces the most overrated cricketers in the world.,8
"If dc and rcb both lose today, we’re gonna have one good match when they’re playing each other",5
Review it,1
I think the best part of QdK is how surprised he is at his own skill. Takes every catch like his career depends on it even though he's dropped fewer than I can count on one hand.,4
Bumrah you beauty!!,6
Wow DC really sucking mad penis rn,5
LMAO. NO WORDS,3
"RCB and Aussies after seeing Stoinis

One of the openers going for a duck

Iyer scoring less than run a ball

Stoinis's decline

This is the sixth time bumrah has taken two wickets in the same over 🥺,6
"Bumrah's breathing fire here

Top, top bowling",10
I've been saying Pant needs to go back to Ranji for more development of his temperament. Took many times he make bad decision just like cwc semi. He should be replaced in DC and be replaced in India squad with more senior Parthiv Patel,-1

Kendra Lust : "" What about these new double D Scotty?""",3
Iyer after the game: I think the boys are REEELY motivated and positive despite everything and we have a lot of learnings from this game :D,8
DC have an interesting balance as they’re the only team with a top 4 of Indian players every other team has atleast 2 (bar MI) and some even have 3. It seemed a smart balance but clear that Dhawan is the only one with experience and the others need a spark. Should’ve tried Hetmyer at 3 imo and tell him to be agresssive.,5
Bumrah breathing fire. Hasn't even bowled Yorkers.,6
Rohitians in shambles,3
"Another wicket coming in 3,2,1...",3
Bumrah is also getting ready for test matches!! Line and length bowling.,9

Daddy Bumrah does not need the new ball to bowl like this.,8

"DC obviously not on their game and MI are blazing, but this Dubai pitches should get better.

I was worried about Abu Dhabi but they've got a better pitch that should hold till the end of the tournament.

Dubai boundaries are huge. Sharjah at least with the tiny boundaries just need enough in the pitch for a good contest.",3
"Learn from RR, they had intention and zeal to qualify. It was visible in last two matches.",7
I remember 2010 season when Mumbai topped league but lost final thanks to Srt injury and sending Pollard too late,7
I love that pudding on Hetmyers head,11
ROT IN HELL THIS STUPID TEAM. They're laughing right now. They don't care shit about whether or not their performance affects the mental health of their supporters. Shithouse your way to 120 and lose this match. Let other goddamn deserving teams qualify. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!,3
"Guys, this is not DC. This is DD.",8

"Ladies and gentlemen, I present you the future of Indian T20 cricket💣",3
In all honesty I don't mind this new game plan by Pant. He's still young and trying to improve his game. Obviously him trying to listen to everyone asking to curb his instincts and be consistent isn't working. Hope he manages to gets back to what he does best.,2
"Pant + Smash and Dash = Irresponsible and possibly the reason he got dropped from Team India

Pant + Conservative = Mediocre player

Are we about the ruin another promising career thanks to lack of confidence (i.e. like Kuldeep the past 12-18 months)",9

Lol this is not the most ideal time in the season for the whole team to run out of juice,3
"At first I thought it was DC being old DD but now the pitch actually looks difficult to bat on. Would have been interesting to see what we scored if we batted first, maybe 150 odd and even that would have been difficult to chase for DC. I am guessing if DC reaches 110 odd we will still take the chase to 17th/18th over",3
Battle of the big unit lol,6
MI should crush DC tonight and give them that sweet dose of Negative NRR,5

Suggestions for name changes (I love doing this): Stagnating Delhi LuckRiders,2

Patel giving the excessive disappointed face so the coach can’t blame him for that dreadful 5(9),4
There's literally no place on that field where you can hide Tiwary.,14
Love to see Tiwari waddle behind the ball.,6
Painful watching Tiwari run,5
"Rabada 23


Bumrah 23 wickets!!!",11
"Mumbai should've batted first, just so that they can use a sub fielder for Tiwary",4
How come UAE has better stadiums,7
NA UMPIRES,6
Ethics professor has arrived,5
where is u/singhsrb,6
"Bumrah now equal with Rabada on 23, hopefully that fires Rabada up and we see some carnage in the 2nd innings",7
Thicccccc Tiwary,6
"Atleast with DD we knew what we were looking forward to, this is just bad cricket.",7
Bumrah is on fire bruh💙🌀🌀🌀💥💥💥,6
Pant fucked Harshal over with that lost review lmao,14
Seriously we don't have other options for tiwary ?,6
Bumrah finally getting closer to that purple cap. My man deserves it,6
"4 games where their batting shat the bed now, I swear to god if all of DCs batsman decide to show up in the last game",5
Ah well that looked out on first sight.,1
The last 10-12 matches in the league stage in IPL should be used to teach kids all about permutation and combination hahaha,6
Saurabh Tiwari is in team so Nita Ambani won't have to hire Santa Claus for this year Christmas 😭😂😭😂,25
MI clearly need a wider man at short fine,11
"Pls Rabada don't take any wickets, wanna see my Boom boi don the purple cap in the next match 🥺",3
Motha bhai at least make the bribing a little more subtle,2
Saurabh ko piche lagao Bhai. Isse bhaga nahi ja Raha.,7
Pant played a shit innings & took a review & now has contributed to Harshal's dismissal,6
"Unless we get our act together against RCB, this should be the curtain call for this sad team.",7
I wonder if we'll even make 100.... And people kept telling me yesterday that there was no way DC will be eliminated this year... I beg to fucking differ... The NRR knock from this will be the death of us.,8
Pant is a selfish fuck. Thanks for wasting the review cunt.,13
Pant maintaining the bro code with tim paine.,2
"As an SRH fan, this is making me quite anxious",6
"Line 1: Bumrah ki agar baat kare to lajawab gendbaazi.

Line 2: Agar review hota to bach jate.

"Be Delhi . Have +0.7 NRR, lose two games by huge margins. Fail to win one to Q, out of IPL 2020 after huge expectations",15
Bumrah about to cost MI fair play points for one-sided match,6
Why is Axar not in the team? Injured or dropped?,3
Its so good to see India's two strike bowlers at the top of wicket taking chart,8
I think what ruined Pant is making him is forcing him to play responsible accumulator when he was an incredible finisher. Shifting Hetmyr to no 4 and delegation of Pant to his natural game is way to go.,6
Is Hetmyer gonna pull a Sam Curran?,2
Wtf is that score. MI will now field a rotated squad against SRH 😭,5
"Of course umpire had to give that out even though it was not out


 it's MI",-6
[deleted],12
"Bruh this team gonna come all guns blazing vs RCB

RCB better fucking win today",10
All this excitement over who'll qualify for playoffs but Mumbai is gonna win the title again anyway. Unless they meet Rajasthan in the knockouts.,27
"DC, please get to 125. We will atleast have something to bowl at.",4
Watching Saurabh Tiwary chase the ball reminds me of chasing my dreams. I will give it 100% effort but inevitably get nowhere close to it.,27
Rishabh Pant hits a 6 only in the Dream 11 ad.. and even thats out,46
"Unpopular opinion: JSW management roughly equally fucked up as the GMR management. The team they assembled at the auction was not good this time, or the last time. You already have decent Indian ""youngsters"" in your team who play fearless bold cricket, and you gave them the role of ""anchoring"" by selecting inconsistent openers. Last year it worked, because you were in India and the Indian players performed. This year, you needed aggressive overseas openers and you selected Stoinis and Jason Roy, both of whom could've opened. But no. Prithvi has frozen legs, Dhawan can only hit on the off and score runs in patches. And to top it off, even the bowling has begun to shit the bed.

&#x200B;

I'm frikkin livid right now. They had created a bold youngster front foot playing team and now they've destroyed that philosophy.",7
Never take a desperate review. When was the last time someone got lucky off one?,9
Ponting bout to kill a few people today,3
Instagram reels with Tiktok type ads.,5
"Ohh man, MI net run rate will go through the roof, not that they need it to.",12
Michael Holding would be furious,3
any chance both DC and RCB get eliminated?,3
"Bumrah
Archer
Rashid
Shami
Chahal

in one team",5
dc fans already hoping for rcb to lose badly against srh,3
"When do they normally wear the caps? 

The moment the ranking changes or after the innings break?",1
I'm sensing that Indian batsman these days are completely unprepared to face pace/spin. You need a lot of practice and skill to hit good bowlers. I remember in 1st test against aus (i think 2013) in chennai when india were 12/2 with pattinson looking in red hot form. Tendulkar comes in and hits 2 beautiful cover drives back to back . He wasnt scared of anyone,15
What's your predicted score ?,0
"Iyer and Pant took Nehraji advice (aap crease pe raho, run apne aap banenge) way too seriously",11
"NCN is here. Now here's an opportunity for Hetmyer to get a few boundaries.


E- Oops",4
Bumrah is my Fantasy Captainnn 😋😋😋,8
Second season in a row when Ashwin's team starts the season with a bang and then loses their way in the second half.,6
"Even ponting gave up on this team., not even taking strategic time out.",11
Goodbye Hetmyer.,6
"Nortje bowling 150 kmph fireballs.

Bumrah : Hold my Scooter.",9
Who's our Wk in in ODI squad,7
Wtf is going on,7
Guys our old Delhi (delhi deardevils)  team is back😂,15
Haha not even 100 from here,11
"Just saw that Archer has an economy of 6.6 Rabada 8.1 Bumrah 7.1, RR would be doing better if the other two Pacers were not giving runs at 12 per over",24
"Lol, NCN you beauty",13
Brainless shot,6
DC's collapse in the last few games has been genuinely mental,6
"Cork : The reason NCN's bowling his 2nd over


*Shows scoreboard where he has 0 wkts*",1
What is this one sided fest today,2
Too easy. Just too easy for MI.,8
Styris finally realising his mistake in falsely attributing DC's loss of fortune to Pant's injury. Pant didn't contribute much to the wins in this tournament and neither did Hetmyer who was also left out when Carey replaced Pant. The real reason is DC lost wicket in the 1st over for the 6th time today in last 8 matches which he rightly pointed out now. This has put lot on Pressure on Iyer who struggles to take off against pace but is much more comfortable against spin which would have been possible if openers played out the first 6 overs.,13
So. Are DC gonna cross 100?,3
Transformation to DD complete.,3
Who do you wallop in this bowling line? No respite bowler,3
"Bumrah vs Rabada let's goooo

Edit: FFS it's some Dubey",3
That's it for Delhi it seems. See you next  year guys.,4
Man this has just been a sad display of batting today :/,4
"It seems Mumbai doesn't need Rohit to win them matches.

Bumrah and Pollard are the magic",5
DC shot like a dog in the street,5
r/cricket gonna bring Saurabh tiwary back to fitness with all these fat jokes lol.,5
"I had too many expectations of DC.

I hope they qualify.",2
KKR’s record in danger,1

I think delhi is on high 78 for 7 I think they won't even cross 100 at this rate,2
"BCCI needs to create a bowling division where they produce bowlers with the catapulting action with stiff arm, clearly the next evolution in bowling",2
As an RCB fan. This is really satisfying. RCB should remain 2nd place ✌️,5
"As a 10 year old from Maharashtra I think I chose the wrong team to support, could have gone with the easy option and lived happily.",7
With nrr getting fucked DC now have a proper shot at a #5 finish,7
Inb4 Iyer : We will learn from this and will be very motivated,4
Archer or Bumrah?,1
"DC should play the long game now, there's no way they are winning this. Knock the ball around and drag your carcass to 120. Then try and keep MI in the game till at least the 18th over. No point saving Rabada and Nortje's overs for the death. It's all about the NRR",3
Like watching a car crash,2
RIP DC run rate.,3
I'm giggling thinking about how Ponting must be losing his mind right now,7
"Oh DC, you are not just getting fucked, more like super-mega-foxy-awesome fucked.",9
"**15.2** Coulter-Nile to Hetmyer, OUT, **pulled straight to deep square.** Short of a length at middle stump, pulls aerially off the front foot and picks out Krunal Pandya who has only a couple of steps to take to his left **78-7**

SO Hetmyer c Pandya b Coulter-Nile 11 (13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 84.61",5

so if rcb lose today then rcb vs dc would work like a knockout,-1
[deleted],6
Does anybody know how to report offensive content to BCCC? I don't think the amount of chest hair NCN is showing is appropriate for national television. Stuff like this can really corrupt the minds of our youth.,12
DC back to the glorious days of Delhi Daredevils.,3
daredevils back to their og song: munde ye delhi ke hum khele front foot pe.,8
delhi daredevils,2
"This is where experience matters... Pitch is difficult, wickets have fallen and 30 balls are left, why play such dumb shot!",2
"Pant, stoinis, hetmyer none of them are match winners. Just big hitters. Sucks for rabada and nokia.",2
match will get over before 6pm,2
"Seeing Delhi's performance today, I seriously want rajasthan and Punjab to qualify along RCB  so they can give a stiff competition to MI",0
MI thank you so much ! I love you guys!,3
DC rips off mask and reveals *Peak RCB*,4
Please crash out and give more deserving teams a chance,2
Delhi reee tu gaand maraaaa,2
Now imagine Archer in the same bowling lineup.,4
DC and RCB want to have an eliminator before the playoffs. Such good sports for giving us another eliminator.,4
"In the match thread of RR vs MI, some DC fans were saying that a full fit DC would completely smack this MI side. LOL",9
"DC in two phases of IPL
First phase :  playing like csk
Second phase: playing like their old DD team",3
"I don't think RCB needs to win anymore matches to qualify, the other teams are screwing up thier own NRR so bad that RCB will easily make it",9
Well that's their NRR completely fucked,10
Please cross 84 please,7
DC NRR go brrr...,7
"Happiness was never an option for KXIP, DC, RR

Just misery",9
"Their should be a documentary on DC just like Mumbai. But with different topic, how these player cope with so many losses. So much mental pressure.",9
Punter gonna have to pad up next game imo.,10
"If I had stepped out of house today and tripped on first stair, that would have been a better day cause pain is better than disappointment.",14
Delhi should make the playoffs somehow on 14 points . No way they get eliminated,-1
"If I was MI captain now, I would make saurabh tewari bowl all of the remaining overs just to  make him run",16
Ponting furiously searching for next flight back to Australia,4
One good thing coming out of resting Hardik today is we got to see the benefit of having an extra bowler. Obviously Hardik will be back but I do miss him as a bowling option.,5
If RCB also loses today DC vs RCB will be very competitive,8
What happens to Delhi run rate if MI chase down a target of 110 in 14 overs? RCB losing today might take the fight for playoff spot to the second last match,8
Bumrah to overtake Rabada in the purple cap pls,5
At this point Star Sports should start displaying Suicide hotlines for DD fans.,9
So MI helped Bumrah and Pandya brothers getting their dreams completed and now they are helping MI to achieve more success!,24
Hetmeyer seems to lack common sense,4
What is the equivalent of DC like team in other sports?,2

Wow literally no one with SR > 100.,3
[removed],10
Mumbai will likely rest Bumrah for Kulkarni for the game against SRH so great chance for SRH to qualify for playoffs if they win scratch a win today,8
Good guys DC making room for both RR and KXIP to qualify,12
I should've invested in MI's NRR. it's only stonks,12
I've a bad feeling that DC Vs RCB will be a knockout match,4
"I am gonna sound extremely harsh on our best batsmen and is an Hot Take- But Dhawan's wicket started this all off, being in such form should have taken some responsibility",4

Ponting to ashwin You are Mr Spirit of cricket please get us beyond 120.,8

Would be quality meme if somebody mankads Ashwin,3
"I'm still rooting for DC to finish in 2nd over RCB or any of the other teams (KKR, SRH, RR or especially KXIP).

Because DC is the weakest of all those teams, and we get to the Final right away..... Though .... not sure if that's even possible anymore with this drubbing by MI; their NRR is about to get much lower.

Only a few players on this team are threats. Shaw is garbage. Pant is mediocre. Iyer is a weak captain. Only 4 players really do work on this team: Dhawan, Stoinis, Rabada and Nortje. Get Dhawan out, and the rest of the batting order collapses. Their bowling core is pretty good between Rabada/Nortje/Ashwin, but their captain (Iyer) makes questionable decisions on when to put guys up. e.g. Axar getting smashed by Gayle in the power play when he should have put in Ashwin instead.",4
When our lower order is more keen on taking doubles. I cant even,3
This matured Pant is shit.,6
DC Vs RCB could be a knockout if RCB loose today,3

You never know with Rabada and Nortje.,4
"Adding to my comments about the shitty opening partnership being responsible for DC's losses, I think Stoinis should have come in at 3 whenever DC lost a wicket in first over or two. He plays at top in BBL and is much more comfortable against pace. Iyer can come at 4 when spinners are into the attack which is his strength. But yeah can't blame Ponting much here because Iyer is supposedly the next big thing from India and sending an Australian over him would have resulted in people questioning his bias.",5

"I dont know what changes they have made since the last 4 games it is the same old shit, batters dont know how to hold a bat",1
"Atapi Vatapi do daitya bhai the

*Looks at Bumrah and Boult*",10
"Mumbai is too good, easily they have the best management. They found players like bumrah, sky, kishan, pandya brothers",18
this is proof that rohit just has the best side and doesnt rly nake any difference as a captain,12
Ashwin just having dejavu with DC's continuous loss,5
Uff had chennai won one more game.,7
[removed],4
Is the pitch difficult for batting or Delhi not executing properly ?,2
"There was a season, maybe 2016 when Delhi was in top 2 till 10 games but lost all remaining matches to finish outside playoff spots. It would be wonderful to see that again.",4
Delhi is the saddest team in IPL history. Chennai fans whinge and moan but they are privileged. Delhi has been cursed from the start and this year we thought it would be different but no. Seriously fuck Pant. Fuck Shreyas and most of all Fuck the most over rated Indian player going around...Prithvi Shaw. What a steaming pile of shit.,11
Oh boy get ready for leaking.,0
MS de Kock immediately reverts to traditional 'collect with two hands and hit the stumps' routine.,8
Seems like James Bond had no time to dye his hair,1
Wonder if Pant will whisper sweet nothings into QdK and Ishan Kishan's ears.,13
"if DC lose today, they will out of top 2 race?",4
Do Mumbai fucking ever drop a catch,11
MI is looking like the 2000's invincible Australian team,10
What a brilliant catch! Krunal you beauty!,5
Brilliant catch,5
Well done lesser Pandya,9
Great catch Krunal!,8
"

Nothing says Bond more than shit beer.",10
Abey leave some wickets for my boi Bumrah ;_;,21
Would love to see Mumbai chase this down in 10 overs,12
Here comes Boult to give some boundaries,-3
Why doesn't mi has an off day,16
So MI confirm top 2 if they win today right. They  can rest and experiment against SRH then.,11
What is that thing that bowlers keep at their feet before starting the run up?,7
"i think it'll be cool if teams could have two playing XIs, and choose whichever one they want depending on whether they bat or bowl first",1
You know you're fucked when only one player in the team has a SR > 100,9
needed something special like this to get Ashwin out,3
"Unpopular opinion : Mr. Ethical should bat at no. 4 for India


^/s",5
Can they just declare MI as winner already,3
Immature innings from Ashwin here.,1
"The problem started when we were 2 down and Iyer, Pant started playing as if we were already 5 down. Attack them ffs. I hate that I am still watching this.",4
"Thought CSK and KXIP were the worse performers this season in the first half...


Looks like Delhi and Punjab kho- Kho each other",2
"**18.1** Boult to Ashwin, OUT, **taken by long-on running to his left!** Krunal Pandya. **96-8**

R Ashwin c Pandya b Boult 12 (9b 0x4 1x6) SR: 133.33",1
That tumble looks like a much safer way to do it on these grounds considering number of injuries throughout the tournament.,9
Last years ipl was waaaaay better,-4
I'm wondering where are those delhi fans commenting tuk-tuk in every CSK match?👀,8
Has Ashwin transferred the 2018 KXIP curse to DC,5
"DC 2 weeks ago: The commonalities of the regular peasants are most perplexing

DC now: Y'all got anymore of those wins?",15
Stoin and Shikhar... noiceee,4
Bumbrah and Boult to end Delhi's suffering.,7
Why the fuck does he want to be cocky? It's a good catch would have been great without that cockiness,5
"This is some collapse by the Capitalists. Weren't they something like 7-2 after 9? They looked the goods, and they've completely fallen off the cliff since then. Vladimir Lenin wept tears of joy, because Ricky Ponting et al have caused a greater shock to capitalism than he ever managed",11
Hope Mumbai chases this in 10 overs,8
"Unreal catch, fair play stud earring looking ass",9
DC is finished,3
There goes the Bradman of the team,3
"MI this year is the TKR of IPL

All great players concentrated in one team",6
"Pollard is impressed with that Catch, even gave Krunal his cap back as a gift offering",8
"wait so if we win today, we get top 2??",5
Those must be some AR goggles that Krunal is wearing.,3
Please fifer for Bumrah,2
Rabada wtf,4
Good Job Rabada!,4
Best batsman for DC arrives,8
Shot of the day.,6
Chad Rabada with 600 SR,10
Rabada- bhen ke lodo sab mere se hi karwao,24
well hello to you too Kagiso,3
What a fucking shot. Stand and deliver. Where were you hiding Rabada all along.,8
100 up. Fuck yeah,2
Rabada timing is too good for a tailender,7
Holy shit,3

"Shaw pant and prithvi, learn from rabada.",3
"Pollard batting

Pant: Dhawan... Ever heard of the term *temporary captain*?",23
With shots like these Rabada should open for DC,3
The sad realisation that we won't even make it past 114.,5
Where did Pointing find a full sized Rabada bodysuit?,15
Is Hardik not playing,5
Kagiso Pandya ladies and gents 😎,8
"Is DC gonna end the season with 5 straight losses? Going from 1st place (7-2) to 5th place or worse (7-7)?

Lulz.",7
Kagiso Brian Lara Rabada,9
Lmao that was unexpected,2
Rabada went full raina,3
Rabada's fastest half century incoming,3
That’s the best shot of the innings? Followed by Ashwin’s 6?,2
Bowling Boult at the death will cost MI an important game against a good team.,8
"Rabada's straight, stylish, long.. . shot",3
sourav rabada.,6
Chad Kagiso. Called all this earlier with his dry and carpety' pitch reading from the hotel.,5
Inb4 36(6) from Rabada,2
Rabada - Batting me karleta hu aap Dream 11 pe team banao,10
Why isn't there a 'Vivo Perfect Catch of the Match' or a 'Karbon Kamaal Catch' this season?,10
OMG,2
"What can DC for the remaining game/next year? Maybe push Stoinis to 3 and Hetmyer 4, Iyer 5 and Pant at 6?",3
ok what does RR need to qualify? Only team who beat mi for some reason,13
kaigo 'ill do it myself' rabada,9
"Come on Kagiso, show them how it's done. And by them I mean your entire top and middle order.",13
Shows how the pitch isn’t that hard to bat on,3
"Just woke up. Saw the embarrassment, absolutely ridiculous",7
Plz take a single Rabada,3
"Me waiting for the weekend to watch a good game. 

DC and MI- I don't think so",6
Learn and learn from rabada. To the DC top order.,3
Bruh I don't care who makes the playoffs. Just don't let MI win the tournament. Anybody but MI please,15
Pollard such a natural cricketer,6
Rabada should open the batting imo,13
"MI giving strong mid-2000s Australia vibes. Just as Rohit's absence doesn't matter much to MI, even Ponting's absence didn't matter much to that team. Also, arguably their most memorable victory overseas came in 2004 under Gilchrist in Ponting's absence.",14
11 runs from this over :OOOO,5
Team in the 7th position has the second best nrr,10
Why cant they show the same angles they did for faf,4
THE LOWER ORDER IS MORE KEEN ON DOUBLES THAN IYER AND PANT. I AM FALLING SHORT ON WORDS,9
"At this point, every other team should put collective effort to make sure RR reaches final, because only they can give us a tough game",10
This game rn is perfectly set up for Boomie to take his maiden 5-fer and also lead the purple cap margin by 2 wickets.,3
Honestly DC played better last year. Except for the KXIP game we werent as bad as this.,6
Qdk scaring Rabada to run faster lol,6
Kinda funny to see Delhi crash and burn after all their gloating in CSK match threads lmao,10
Should’ve sent rabada before Ashwin and dubey,5
Would MI prefer SRH in the playoffs over the other contenders?,4
Scenes if dc win it from here,3
How is Boult in the death?,1
Time for Bumrah to ruin his figures,-2

If thats the case its gonna be 3 team playoffs",2

"Don't play like that Rabada. Whenever a good bowler plays a shot like this, Irfan Pathan nightmares haunt me.",10
I love Rabada. Always determined.,3
How does everyone go in trash form at the same time.,3
Only way MI loses any hame from now it's that Boult and Bumrah have an off day. They look like they don't need Rohit at all.,5
Please delhi take the chase to last over so it doesn't effect our nrr,6
Dubey should give strike to rabada,2
DC sending in Dubey ahead of Rabada this match and Tushar below all the others in the SRH match is gonna cost them big time in NRR.,3
Set the alarm for 5AM but decided to sleep some more. Good thing I did that. WTF happened to DC? They r really unraveling at the crucial part of this IPL,6
Bumrah's last over has been expensive all this tournament... Hope its not the case today,3

Delhi Daredevils are back haha",6

rabada be like average kharab ho gaya,6
That run out sums up DC's season.,7
Bumrah's only weakness: He can't statpad,10
I want this run out counted to my tally and where is my purple cap.,6
Bumrah asserting his dominance over Rabada with that last ball run out,9
Imagine getting knocked out after winning 5 in the first 7. Either dc or rcb is gonna pull this lmao,10
"If the Indian team plays as good as MI are playing rn, there are a lot of comments about 'are we peaking too early?' Not seeing enough of that from MI supporters",6
Nelson to win,3
"In how many overs will MI has to chase this, so that dc nrr falls below kkr ?",8
"Ravichandran Ashwin  and Kagiso Rabada were the only ""batsmen"" from Delhi Capitals to score at a strike rate >100

That pretty much sums up this batting display by DC",11
less than 114 lmao,9
I’m sorry but is this the same team that won 7 games out of 9 and now are about crash out??,12
"**19.6** Bumrah to Rabada, OUT, slower short of a length ball into middle stump. Looks for the slog and gets an inside edge onto body. Takes a couple of steps down, tries to back into the crease as Bumrah swoops down on the ball. Hasn't stretched out quickly enough as Bumrah hits the stumps with an under-arm flick **110-9**

K Rabada run out (Bumrah) 12 (7b 0x4 1x6) SR: 171.42",4
Forget the fact that Delhi are gonna lose. The NRR is going to be terrible after this. Just what Delhi didn't need. How the hell do they manage to screw everything up. 4 damn losses in a row.,6
"*DC chokes like shit in the first game*

RCB waiting for the second game to begin: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",6
That last run out shows the focus and commitment of this team and this is why they are at the top right now. Great stuff by Bumrah.,8
"So how exactly did Mumbai go ""this Bumrah will be a star"" ? Would like to know more about scouting in cricket. Did Bumrah have a good domestic record prior to being picked in the IPL?",14
Probably par score the pich is minefield with delhi top bowling,3
Can someone tell MI they can't carry forward NRR to next season 😝,11
Can any1 send me DC jersey for tonight's Halloween Party?,7
"Bumrah has bowled probably least Yorker in his IPL career this year and is still purple cap holder.

Easy one. Ponting.",-12
ugh MI LOOK SO INVINCIBLE IT'S NOT FAIR,10
DC going from Peak CSK to Current CSK in a single season. Truly the successor.,10
What will Delhi's NRR be if they lose within 10 overs?,4
why did india drop pant from ODI and T20 squad ...someone said its becoz of his weight issue?,5
"The key to beating MI is scoring as much runs as them, not more",5
Lol cricbuzz got the description of the last run out completely wrong.,5
DC have a gun bowler in Sandeep Lamichane and still Stoinis/Hetmyer playing ahead of him,9
"people saying the daredevils are back.... they played only against mi when they were daredevils

they even crushed mi's playoff spot in 2018, dd>>>>>dc",7
MI were just toying with them bowling Chahar and Krunal at the death lol,11
MI will chase this score twice. DC wtf!!,10

That MI lineup is fucking scary.",5

DC was better with rahane and carey before hetmeyer and pant joined atleast they were winning games,3
DC crashing out. watch DC fans crawl back into their caves,2
[removed],9
Iyer doesn't really deserve to be the captain. Not a great T20 batsman or a good tactician just a waste of spot. Dhawan/Ashwin should captain next year,5
We don't appreciate the IPL scriptwriters enough. They do a great job of writing something so compelling.,8
"Delhi and Mumbai are so similar in terms of players playing specific roles:
An attacking bowling duo
Two finishers in the lower order
Good Indian batsmen in the top order",0
Wtf how have I never heard Bumrah talking before. His voice is so different to what I imagined,6
MI asking to retain NRR in next season.,10
DC counted their chickens too early,2
so top dugout moments is basically the highlights?,2
"MI batting : Perfectly balanced

RCB batting : Good start, shitty middle overs, good end

DC batting : Can’t do much without a good start from Dhawan

SRH batting : Top heavy

KXIP batting : Gayle heavy 

KKR batting : c o l l a p s e

RR batting : Can chase anything on their day

CSK batting : Test20",29

"It's ok lads, today's gonna be lowest score ever defended in the IPL 😎. We also saw the highest score being chased this season",5
I just hope MI to give rest to few of their players against us(SRH).,9
Iyer sucks the momentum out of the innings almost everytime he bats. His team deserves to be out the way he bats!,10
"So if Rababa picks one more wicket, the cap will switch again after the match?",10
MI too stronk pls nerf,13
Chris Lynn should've gotten a game at least. His massive sixes are more entertaining than all of MI top order.,6
TIL I like Bumrah,9
Just about every single player in DC peaked too early.,11
can mi sustain their current line up intil next year. surely some of them will be asking for more money right?,5
Incoming MI win by 10 wickets.,8
Ah 2020 gets weird all thought at least MI won't win this year.,8
"India's T20 and ODI squad has been the same barring 1 or 2 players for some time. 

I think this approach needs to change, you need to have big hitters like Windies players not Iyer and Pandey.",6
"Since our team is paralysed and cant do anything for themselves, which team should we be supporting later tonight?",4
Bumrah looks extremely humble,10
MI games are predictable and boring. 1/10 ratings on IMDB for MI shows.,12
At least we will see some fireworks in this inning.,2
"If MI chase this score in 15 overs DC's NRR goes below KXIP.
If they chase this in 8 overs DC's NRR will goes below RR.
5 overs to go below KRR's NRR.",7
MI used 6 bowlers and all are capable of bowling full quota and still had pollard!! I feel even international team can have such best combination.,5
Remember when DC were winning even without Pant and Hetmyer. Those were the days. Didn't win a single game ever since they came back. 😭 Carey we're sorry please come back.,2
MI can you please finish this before 8:30 am so I can watch Sheffield beat Man City.,2
MI please finish this in 10 overs,3
"TBH I don't want DC to qualify as 3/4th position, because they will be dead weight, better to have RR/KXIP in that position",3
Mumbai is treating rest of the teams like associate nations and they are peak Australia.,9

Incoming MI (Ban) - 58 a.o.",8
"When Ashwin and Rabada have a higher strike rate than the rest of your batsmen ....

You know you done fucked up.",9
anyway DC are going to win this?,3
"Can someone PLEASE explain how Delhi have become so shit in such a short space of time??? Genuinely can't fathom it. Shreyas looks like he's let all the 'talented young captain' talk go straight to his head, Punter looks indifferent, Pant's curbed his own natural game for no reason, Shaw's regressed, Stoin's regressed, and the bowling unit are going to give this total up in 12 overs. AND we're about to go back to our shit owners for the next two years. Fun times indeed /rant",6
Ponting’s position should not be untenable. The players bat with no mindset to win and don’t win.,2
Next game (RCB vs SRH) is gonna be rough. It will be a bad result for Delhi either way.,3
We have to bat well in Rabada's overs.,3
I think the only way to beat MI is make them defend a score. They have lost 2 matches out of 4 while defending. The other two being super over losses.,4
MI have never ever won a match in Dubai till now. That includes the 2014 season and this one as well.,4
Bumrah Future MI Captain confirmed,13
"MI innings about to start, so obligatory SKY should be in the Indian T20i XI at #3 in place of Virat Kohli",10

"To the DC fans who want SRH to win tonight so that DC Vs RCB is a knockout- Would you rather take on KXIP or SRH's NRR? Best case scenario is that SRH lose today, so that even if DC loses Vs RCB they might sneak in at 4th place",7
The saddest bit of this IPL has would be that even Saha has got the license to take on the bowling while they've tamed Pant into one of those anchor roles that you can get a dime a dozen in India.,11
"Dont think it's very difficult to bat on this pitch. Most wickets were errors from the batsmen. Dhavan, Shreyas Iyer, Shaw  Heytmayer's wickets were not a result of brilliant bowling.",4

"Poor powerplay from MI....

Just 38 of 6 overs /s",3
Unpopular opinion: The reason why captains save their strike bowlers for later is cos regardless of what the total is teams should always play to win and back themselves to somehow defend the total. Playing for NRR in a losing match does not provide sufficient returns. So they try to squeeze out the overs of their worst bowlers early on in the powerplay when the batsmen are not set yet. Of course this comes with the caveat that once the batsmen become set it will be difficult for the strike bowlers to get them out but imagine if the batsmen just plays out the strike bowlers. They can rain hell on the rest afterwards. Just my opinion any disagreements are welcome.,8

So guys i spent 10 coins on MI today.. how many will i get back?,0
Isn't paresh rawal an MP now? Why is he doing ads?,-1
MI will be mathematically in top 2 so they are most probably gonna rest Bumrah and other key players while giving bench guys a chance against SRH. So SRH will have a golden chance to beat them.,9
It's time for ashwin to use the ultimate variation.,4
Rishabh Pant is a handsome boy,-1
"If mi take this deep, its ok for Delhi",-2
It's weird how they're advertising MG as a British car company when it's clearly owned by the Chinese,11
Can a teams NRR go up even if they lose?,2
Increase bowlers Quota to 6 overs please. Atleast make it for one bowler in an innings can bowl 6 overs. They could do wonders.,-4
Chad KL in yesterday’s post match press conference says they were 10-15 runs *ahead* of the par score,8
Ethics teaching ethics to his ethical team.,2
"DC huddle at timeout. “Camera is on us, let’s talk something. How about we talk about our ex-s?”",12
"MI's bowling unit is probably the best. The batting is good but not great with Rohit out. What makes them formidable is the intent they show. Good, calculated, aggressive cricket. Plans are stuck to, no tomfoolery, constantly looking for the release shot. They play in the present though, they look to attack each ball. DC on the other hand are a mess, they are reluctant to play shots.",5
Thought Iyer is going to bowl for a moment,2
Rubber so ded that I chose to take my online class over it,2
Send Pollard in next. I haven't seen him bat in weeks.,6
WHATTA FUCKING FIRST BALL DUBEY,2
Rabada is such a trash bowler. Any trundler can defend 10 runs against peak Russell or conceed 2 runs against KL and Pooran in a super over.,9

"Pant wicketkeeping while Kishan is batting:

&#x200B;

fk you fk you fk you",13
Lol Kishan and Pant are U19 mates. They were captain and vice captains.,9
Delhi should consider it a blessing if they lose with less than 3 overs remaining. I don't expect Delhi to beat RCB but both are meme teams it's only a matter of who plays worse lol,4
That's not out right.,1
That's worth a review I reckon.,2
Kishan wtf you doing lol,5
Weak T from Ishan there,-1
That fake smile by Kishan to Pant.,7
"Got a feeling that mi will be defeated in the final, dunno by who",5
7D chess by Kishan to show Pant can't stump him.,7
Pant asserting dominance by stumping wicketkeepers,6
They are so determined to win this by 10 wickets lmaoo,5
Not out,5
"Can we play Anmolpreet Singh in place of Tiwary or Aditya Tare ,",3
MI deliberately scoring slower so it doesn't hurt DC's NRR. They'd prefer DC over RCB for qualifier. BIG BRAIN TIME.,11
Dubey Dubey Doo-bah Dubey Dubey Doo-bah... AGENT P(ravin)!,2
Lol. What in the world is Ishaan trying here?,3
Not a good decision at all,3

Yay.,2
Surely that's going down leg,2
What a fucking shitty decision as I said.,5
Shit umpiring,5
"Bruh that was sooooo not out, was the umpire high?",11
Bad Umpiring Pro Max Ultra,12
Kishan took his foot outside off stump before slogging.,3
clear of stumps?,2
"Be embarassed umpire, be embarrassed.",11
The umpire just wanted to make the game a little interesting :(,5
Dude the ball turneddddd lmaooooo,3

"Dubey vs Dube.  


Who would win?",7
idk why some people here are saying dc will be a better opposition than rcb for mi in playoffs,13
Dubey had a bowling average for about 30 seconds,8
They could have fit an India Gate between the stumps and the ball there.,11
DC will consider this a win if they extend this up to the 16/17th over,10
[That was a fucking horrendous decision](https://imgflip.com/i/4kitsu),3
Why there is no turn in the ball tracker?,4
Kishan and Pant the two openers of our U19 team back then,9
Pant kya bola..,3
"Dubey vs Kishan battle looks so Bihari, yet it isn't.",6
3 wicket keepers on crease,4

Lol Qdk showing Kishan how it's done,7
I hope they send boult to bat,7
Who kept in U19 WC 2016 ? Pant  or Ishan?,2
Man I wish they would finish this off quick. I want DC's NRR to be in the gutter,10
Lol decock is giving kishan coaching,11
"Okay so Id SRH win today, they'll be 4th",3
Ball tracking didn't correctly model the ball turning .... but it would have still missed imo.,6
Qdk: *That's how it's done kid.*,6
DC doesn't deserve to be in final,5
Kishan 🤝 De Kock,4
Great batting this. NRR is the last thing on MI's mind because they're leagues ahead of everyone else.,6
Thers is the head scratching from Iyer. Sometimes I feel he is not comfortable being the captain.,10
"hahaha, bunch of clowns in SS Tamil. RJ Balaji and Sadagopan Ramesh making up songs for Tewatia. And singing in tune.",10
Every time a boundary is hit and camera points to Shreyas he looks more clueless than before. Embarrassing.,10

"Praveen Dubey also plays for Karnataka? Such an OG domestic team, man",9

Umpires should be fined 10% match fee if their decisions get overturned twice in a match,7
Why pick the budget Sandeep when you have the real Sandeep,6

What a Partnership this is bw Ishan de Kock and Quinten Kishan,20
Send Bumrah just for the memes,14
"Nice tactics from Iyer, saving Rabada and Nortje when they have to defend 20 from 40 balls with 10 wickets in hand.",8

All 11 can bat. Stokes would be the third pacer. It would be a dream



P.S, I know our batting is already very deep (till 10) but a man can dream",6
Fuck 15 seconds timer for DRS review. Instead directly go for 3rd umpire everytime there is a LBW chance.,7
The scary thing is Mumbai's best batsman in this lineup is still in the dressing room,15
"That's the same shot Pant plays, except his version is ugly af. He loses his balance and swivels with his entire body. I like ishan's execution better",5
"DC giving tribute to its former self, DD, how poetic!",3
Rohit will probably bat at 4 if he comes back.,-7
Patel respecting his mota bhai,2
Shreyas ffs bowl Nortje and Rabada. Get some wickets atleast. This game won't go till death.,3
Kinda wished they would score faster so dd's nrr could drop but ig pitch isnt easy to bat on,8
"Don't mind me, just here to watch SKY bat",10
"Another 10 wicket win pls, also go easy on dc so their nrr doesn't take a hard hit",2
Cricbuzz said if Mumbai win in 15 overs Delhi's nrr will go below punjab.,8
To be completely honest we just overperformed at the  beginning of the season and combined with some collapses by the other teams our record was inflated. We always were and are a middle of the table team. And now we're just regressing back to the mean.,13
"Fun fact: "" Harshal Patel wanted to quit Cricket in 2018 and move to  USA but Ponting talked him out of it and now in 2020 he's defending 57 runs of 70 balls""",55
Ishan Kishan only scores in low score chases lol.,-1
MI fans flexing: Our team's games are so boring since they're so one-sided ohmygaawwwd!,18
Doesn't it bother the batsmen that there's just this sunlight on the batting side if the pitch,6

"A lot of people shitting on Pant for his bad batting and etc... Y'all do realize he is primarily an opener too like Kishan right? His best innings have also come whilst opening or coming in at 3. He really never was a finisher, or a proper middle order bat",4
"Weird when Delhi were winning they'd publicize all those Ponting post match dressing room speeches and stuff all over YouTube and twitter and now there's been no content on that front past 3 matches or so. 

That dressing room must be scary post matches. Ponting also has to shoulder a lot of the blame. Team selection has been all over the place. No matter how many lefties a team has, I'd never drop someone as good as Axar Patel.",43
"By God MI taking it so deep, Dhoni is present  somewhere on the ground",7

"""Ricky told me that I was brilliant at preparation but needed to get better at performance,"" Patel says. ""That sort of cleared things for me because I always felt I was pretty confident in practice but probably 10% less confident in the match. On the field, I was getting worried about not being able to execute my plans.",7
Kishan playing like how Pant used to play.,4
Mumbai are winning without Rohit the captain. Goes on to show how strong the team is. Not saying Rohit isn't a good captain. Just that he can't be judged on IPL stint alone.,5

Don't know whether to be sad for no 10 wicket win or be happy that sky will come to play,8

How fast was it?,2
"Question, why are batsmen allowed to try and stop the ball from hitting the stumps if it goes off their body?",1
Punter coached MI a bit too well and set them up on the path to be a champion team . Pretty sure he can do something similar for DC as well with time .,12
Damn,3
It's baffling to hear the commentators criticize Mumbai's batting or their RR. Why on earth would you go all guns blazing and risk loss of wickets when your target can be achieved by going <6 rpo?,12
Me to DC: Daredevil died for this?,6
Finish it early and make your mark on the selectors SKY,7
SKY is such an elegant player,5

Well played kishan 👏,5
Ishan is making a strong case for our next opener,3
Will Rabada go wicketless today as well? I think so! MI are playing beautifully now.,3
I sense a feeling mumbai might snatch a victory from here on . Just a feeling.,7
DC pls don’t qualify for playoffs and save yourself the embarrassment,1
Not many things have gone DC way today but guys like Pant and Shaw have started to war Jersey tucking away. Which makes their tummy looks less chubby ❤️,2

Rabada wicketless for 2 matches??,3
Rabada bout to go wicketless for a second game in a row,5
**Prediction survey**: Who would Shreyas Iyer blame for todays loss??,7
So what was actually par here? 160?,2
Whos that fat guy sitting next to Boult?,6
Who is that sitting next to Boult,2
surely Rabada can't go wicketless in consecutive games,5
My parents took me to india when I was child and my clearest memory is crying because my curry was wayyy too spicy haha.,23
"R/cricket ultra jinxed Delhi into having 0 players in form, Shikhar got out on 0 twice. Kudos, we can do anything",8

"We have done everything we possibly could do for RCB to be in top 2, they just have win one of the next two and don't lose the other game that badly.",13
End this in this over SKY.,3
Kishan kar de chadhai,3
Kishan > Pant? How is his keeping tho?,6
"The fact that delhi stopped posting videos on youtube,says a lot about the negative mindset and atmosphere in the room. It was so bad that they couldn't even edit it to look normal.",22
"IPL cricket is a sport where 22 men shout Ben Stokes at each other, take wickets and score Unacademy sixes, and in the end, Mumbai Indians win.",19
Come on 1 more six and end the match,2
SIX,2
Suggest something good to watch this is depressing,6
Csk fans must be wishing that one of the teams they beat wins the final. You know why.,5
When does Ponting not chew gum?,2
It disgust me knowing that Shaw will open in test,5
None of the batsman in Mumbai’s team today are in Indian International team.,11
"Thats it, we need RR in the finals. Make it happen universe!",6
I’ve been very impressed by Kishan. He’s looked solid with the bat and seems to really know his game on both sides of the wicket. Apparently he’s also the best with the gloves in India. He may make a case for India very soon as a keeper-batsman,11
finally we can see post match show of the afternoon match.,11
Oooh can't wait to see the NRR column on the table,2
CHAKKA MAARO,2
People suddenly saying Kishan>Pant..... like bruh the kneejerk calm down lol,9
Is Saha fit for the next match?,2
Aww man wish they'd have finished it in that over itself,3
WE WANT SIXER,3
"Get this over before the timeout.

DC ek chakka kha ke dikha.",2
Finish it off in style pls,4
"Can't even imagine how much MI's run rate will shoot after this game, lmao. From the next edition, a team should be given a choice to share their NRR with the other teams. ｡◕‿◕｡",6
6 more runs and DC’s NRR falls below KXIP,7
Damn Rabada wicketless in 2 matches in a row,7
DC losing with big NRR. Nice,1
Lets give trophy to 2nd best team,0
Is it possible both kxip and RR get into playoffs ??,7
People crying about 15 overs. What is it about?,2
Lol DC is going to get fucked in terms of NRR,10
"DC decline is just sad now tbh. Their fans were so happy, hopeful (& cocky ofc) for initial few weeks.

Hope they qualify🤞",7
Double header Saturday and we will still be able to see the post match presentation before the second match starts. Huehuehue,7
Hear me out: What if Ambani pressured Selectors to keep Ishan and SKY uncapped for MI. Coz no sane person would pick Prithwi and Pant over these two,-4
Holy fucking shit,2
WE WANT A SIX,2
Shottayyyy,1
"I will pay per view to watch ponting's speech in the dressing room.

"Cheer up Delhi fans, at the end of the day you will always have #sextillion7thpower",11
"Ishaan Kishan is having a breakthrough year this season. 

He should be in the frame now as a back up keeper for India if selectors are paying attention. 

Pant and Kishan can both be groomed together and see who will develop into being the main one in next couple of years.",10
What a shot damn,1
"So for the srh match, any chance Lynn and McClenaghan come in for de kock and Boult?",4
"YAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS, THANK YOU SO MUCH MI",6
All over! Ishan you beauty!,3
Hell yeah Kishan you the man,3
Bloody beauty,3
Ishan Kishan finishing it in style.,3
"Shreyas Iyer, looks a bit like Malayalam actor Dileep no?",2
This team is ruthless. They butchered Delhi's net run rate.,11
The way Kishan destroys the pacers is just awesome,4
What a way to end the match. Such a satisfying noise off the bat.,5
Chad Ishan,2
Take that Nokia ! We are #1 at least in league stage.,8
Bumrah keeps the purple cap let's gooo,7
CONGRATS MI IPL 2020 CHAMPS!,6
"That's a six, what an innings from Kishan.",3
Other teams deserve to be in play off just end the DC's misery.,7
Nrrrrr ???,4
Bumrah was robbed of MoM last game as well. Better not be the case today,7
"Finally, DC put out of their misery...",6
Lmao get rekt DC,4
Ishaan Nandkishor Awasthi ftw.,7
Bloody hell. What am I supposed to do for the next hour now.,14
Extra points to Ishan for closing the game quickly,10
Just in time for me to switch to f1.,6
"Love Kishan's aggressive batting, hits sixes like no other.",4
Players who broke Sachin and Kambli's Harris shield record and also play in the IPL have grown into some of the lesser fit players in the IPL. List includes Sarfaraz and Prithvi Shaw,7
Thanks MI!,6
"Unpopular opinion- Kishan>SKY, he's only 22 and its better to invest in the future",11
Ishan looks so smug after hitting those sixes lmao. He just won the game and not one smile on his face,4
They didnt even have Rohit or Hardik....scary,10
Well and truly demolished,3
So now whichever team among KKR and RR wins the toss tomorrow will have their fate in their own hands.,3
Delhi are so fucked man.,6
I asked for them to end it before quali and they did. Love you mumbai !,3
Gee that NRR.,3
Pant sweating heavily,3
"fuark bro that is a nice way to finish it, glad he took us the whole way after the 99, poor guy looked devestated, love to see that fucking passion and desire",5
Kishan’s neck movements are second only to Pankaj Tripathi 😄,6
Complete performance by Delhi. Just missing the Shaw dropped catch!,13
Top 2 guaranteed now?,10
It is scary how MI casually dick teams without Rohit and Hardik,13
Entire team lost the form - be it batsmen or bowlers. Great team spirit lol,9
The shitshow to end all shitshows.,5
"MI: NRR stonkss

Not like they needed it anyway",10
"The real question for MI is. 

Who the hell will they retain. 

This is a perfect 11",11
Freaking love this MI team.,8
MI is the only constant happiness in my life and I'm not kidding. 😭,30

"Rahane spotted in MI camp?!!!

Ah, NVM, That's just Dhawal Kulkarni",18
Shikhar is always smiling. Now I Like that.,4
DC NRR not go brrrr,12
Rohit impressed with that timing. This is his reaction😙,12
Kishan is going to finish with a six.,5
The way how Ishan and Pant hugged was so wholesome.,11
r/cricket wins.,7
Where are all those cocky DC fans?,18
"To all the people vouching that MI would 100% win this year.... Doing well in league matches means shit, proof being India in ICC events",12
What is DC RR now?,3
Kishan is the Indian Nicholas Pooran,9
Damm no Pant and Kishan rift :(,12
Wholesome hug between pant and ishan,8
"So mumbai is now chasing without Hardik, Pollard, Krunal, Tiwary having to face a ball. Nice",7
Sorry to all of you for that nrr calculation. I had just copy pasted the nos. And realised that I copied the wrong nos.,4
DC ahead of Punjab by barest of margins obviously in net run rate,2
Boring as fuck match,9
Rohit Sharma sitting in the back looking like a Cartel Boss,21
NRR reverse stonks,3
No Pandya No Rohit No Pattinson? no problem apparently,8
MI guaranteed top spot,8
"You are welcome, KXIP, KKR and RR fans.

Especially KXIP, their NRR is now higher than DC's after this drubbing.",14
Damn that Pant hug to IK was so wholesome! He looked genuinely happy for Kishan.,11
"The game was on a knife edge, until the first ball was bowled.",14
MI = Australia from 2000's,8
"DC NRR goes from +0.3 to -0.159 (KXIP NRR is -0.133)

MI NRR goes from 1.18 to 1.29

https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-series/3130/indian-premier-league-2020/points-table",17
star sports team trembling in fear on what to show till the next match starts.,29
Imagine rohit having to come at 3 because of Nissan Kishan.,14
Hey KL... This is how you anchor an innings...,17
"Mumbai is as dominant as Bayern right now. No loss or inconsistency in sight. Cheers, this cup has Mumbai written all over it again.",13
What's DC's nrr now,1
"MI, RCB, KXIP and RR are making the top 4.",5
"MI IS SO OP THAT EVEN ITS BENCH TEAM CAN MAKE IT TO THE TOP 4.
LIKES OF CLENAGHAN,HARDIK,ROHIT,TIWARY,LYNN,KULKARNI.",14
"And to think us MI fans had already written off this season because it is an ""Even Year""...",10
Hopefully Iyer doesn't become a Karun Nair. I am sure he is more talented but I think he needs some changes.,6
We were about 100 runs short,13
"With DC losing under 15 overs, what changes happen wrt the table ?",5
Iyer pls say that it was your fault and of the remaining batters,5
lol that was so anti climatic,4
Cakewalk,3
"Sweet, clinical win. Breakout oturnament for Kishan imo. He did have some big innings every once in a while, but I dont remember him performing this consistently.",10
So does this mean we’re not playing the finals v MI then?,10
Iyer looks done for the season. Would be a miracle if we make it to playoffs now.,4
So this proves Bumrah is our most valuable player. Can't believe we won against a team like Delhi without Rohit and Hardik.,19
MI finished it just before F1quali,6
There are no solutions to this team so its best they crash out and don’t rob us of a great playoff match.,7
Moral victory for CSK that they made more runs than DC today,9
Delhi gave their fans some high hopes just to fuck with them so hard in the 2nd half of the IPL. Feel for you Delhi boys.,8
Dhoni's friends in dream 11 ad are also old. Cheeky dig or conscious decision to make Dhoni feel comfortable?,11
"Hell yeah DC NRR below us!!!

Now watch us choke tomorrow for it to not even matter",19
"Feel bad looking at Iyer

It should Ponting out there taking the blame. Iyer is just a proxy for him.",10
"As payment for destroying Delhi's net run rate, the right thing for Punjab to do is return Pooran to his original IPL franchise.",10
Can delhi push pant to open and tell him to go crazy on pp? At least with freedom he could get his natural style.,10
Hoping punjab and hyderabad to shit the bed so RR makes through to the qualifiers!,5
"haha blaming the openers. good he doesnt hold back,direct answers.",12
Do we have a chance if we lose both the matches?,13
-0.16,3
"If Shreyas shaves and grows a little shorter and puts curls in his hair, he'll be an exact copy of Sachin Tendulkar.",9
This win ensures MI aren't afraid of Dubai anymore.,19
Delhi in real danger of being knocked out..,9
"As an RCB fan, even if we make it to the finals somehow, even if Kohli and ABD fire, I honestly don't think we'll win. I don't think we have the bowling to pull that off.",18
Pant is such a nice kid. Hope he gets it together,24
I want a clip of the progression of Iyer's post match interviews in the last 4 games.,15
Tomorrow is going to be epic,7
mi nrr almost 1.3 again,5
-0.159 NRR for DC,11
Don't rob Bumrah pls,10
[removed],9
"SRH lose tonight - SRH out.
RCB go win the match tonight.",13
"Shreyas Iyer's speech:We fell short of like 26-27 runs,Uhh you could just say like 81 runs!!",30
How many times have MI topped the league stage?,9
"I want a Pant, Kishan and Samson six hitting contest. I also may or may not want them to fight each other to death for that coveted keeper spot.",12
"RCB, please trash DC so that both KXIP and RR can qualify. They have both played very exciting cricket",16
Wait Boult's leaving?,10
In b4 Ponting's legendary speech and he spanks Iyer with his bat.,12
How much do kkr and rr need to win by to beat dc in points table?,5
Please press F for us Delhi boys,13
I would really like us to not do fuck all if we are 2 down while batting and keep going at it. Even the tailenders can get 6 an over to get to score like we saw today.,10
"Poor Iyer, looks as if he'll break into tears any moment.",14
"Last year KXIP raced away to 5-2 in first half and then fell flat with continuous losses in second half to miss out on playoff race. Now DC has lost 4 in a row in second half after racing away in first half.

Is DC gonna do a KXIP (like last year). It certainly is looking that way.",13
Ishan Kishan has turned from a innocent boy to bunty bhaiya real fast. Pandya brothers' company is not very good for your style.,36
"Hey look on the bright side DC,we get to see the toss for game 2",24
"Full props to Mumbai for persisting with players like Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav and De Kock when other teams weren't ready to and now, they're reaping the benefits. This is how you fucking run an IPL team. Not by blowing half your budget on a couple of big names and hoping the rest of the team somehow pull through..",49
Ah yes I know this feeling. Almost going out ... how I missed you.,2
Is Boult heading back to New Zealand?!,12
"Couple weeks ago, MI and DC looked far ahead of the other teams",22
"I am gonna take a lot of flak but for this specific game, it was the fault of Dhawan having been in such terrific form should have stayed till PP, but got out in the first over and which orchestrated the shitshow. But now coming to the main show- Shaw has to be better. Pant and Iyer idk what is happening with them Pant specifically, pls be done with that responsibility shit. Stoinis is being Australian Stoinis, Hetmyer should bat at 4.",12
[removed],6
Shaw didn't drop any catch. Some positive for Delhi,14
No MOM for Ishan Kishan today also,5
The best part of the shit show is that this shit that they call a team can not only still qualify but actually make top 2 if results go their way.,15
Kehte hain agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaho ... to puri kainaat usse tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai,6
Now I see why RCB released Stoinis. He’s batted well in 2 games,11
"so i think for RR to qualify without depending on NRR 

 SRH needs to lose today...KXIP needs to lose to CSK...RR needs to win against KKR...and RCB to win against DC",5
"If RCB lose tonight, this will be the best top4 race in a long time.",12
QdK's innings was ordinary yet his score was more than any DC batsman. No DC batsman managed to score more than MI's second highest score lmao,16
Guys I want MI RCB SRH and RR to qualify. It’s possible right ?,15
"Not sure why Iyer is saying like the world ended after DC lost two wickets in the PP lol sure Bumrah was there, but bruh look in the mirror, you and Pant were striking at 4 an over against Krunal and Jayant Yadav. 

Unless and until Iyer ups his SR by 25-30 and leaves his fuck all anchoring approach behind, DC are going to lose more and more matches. Not just this season, even if they persist with the same XI next season. 

No one barring Stoinis has showed any intent all season (middle-order). I'm shocked that this is coming from a side coached by Ricky.",17
At least there won’t be overlap with the next match. we won’t even have to miss the toss,8
"Hyderabad had legit chances of they win rest of their matches , it's simple for them win no need tor NRR calculation .",14
"Bumrah -23,
 Boult -20",14
Let's see if DC can pull of a 2019 WC NZ here. But with no super over bs,4
Does finishing 1st over 2nd make any difference? There's no home or away field ...,9
"DC fans on this sub, ready to #WhistlePodu tomorrow?",24
SKY to selectors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgwWAvv6Jnk,5
"Me: sports weekend, F1 quali and mumbai match. Have to switch between sports now.

MI: allow me to spare some time for you.",13
DC and RCB both trying hard to not finish in top 2. Would be interesting to see who wins,17
"I think all other teams should elect RR as their champion to fight against MI in the IPL final. No matter how shit our season or form has been, we bring our best against Mumbai",23
"Atleast we didn't lose this bad, just sayin",6
So wholesome to see everyone chatting and catching up,7
I want to see Harsha Bhogle bat,10
"The fault really lies with management for a lot of our woes. Like why does Pant bat with no intent? Why does the match end if we are two down early? Why can’t the openers play sensibly against the threat of Boult opening spell? 

There are just too many questions. The answer is that the management is incompetent.",9
Ishan Kishan doing well makes me happy. Small town representation plus also representing every guy who couldn't go out to get a haircut due to the pandemic,11
Happy we have qualified and would be on top 2 in a even year. Don't know what we will do further considering its a even year lol,6
"Capitals going back to Daredevils: Ah, the good old days are back",11
"Ishan kishan  earned my annual salary package within 3 hrs, lol.",28
Both Kishan and samson didn't changed their batting style and they are still scoring runs. I wonder what has changed with pant. Why he was forced to changed his attacking game and now he is struggling.,11
"MI fans so used to luxury of their team winning that they can talk about how it could've been a 10 wicket win, or that they're performing well in an even year.",19
Iyer should bat at 4. He is not a number 3 with his weakness against pace. He will be batting at 4/5 for India anyway. Stoinis/Hetmyer should bat at 3 with Iyer and Pant following him.,8
If DC and RCB lose their remaining games(which is not too unlikely) then MI will be the only team to win more than 50% of their matches,8
"They should get rid of the coin toss in the playoffs.

Higher seed should automatically get to choose to bat or bowl every match.

Otherwise, there's no difference between finishing 1st or 2nd, and 3rd or 4th.",4
Pollard embracing the memes,7
"Yes, it's all falling into place for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Good Good.",3
Dafuq Ishan MoM?  Batriachy is unbearable,20
"Sure, Ishan performed well. But, it was the bowlers who set up the match. A bowler deserved the MoM.",11
Bumrah /Boult deserved the MoM.,17
Pollard talking about even vs odd years’ performances hah!,19
This year's plot twists have really taken us by surprise. Good job scriptwriters!,9
"*DC only need to win against RCB to seal playoff spot potentially*

Yeah we are not winning shit at this moment.",19
Batriarchy booooo,26
Ridiculous that Kishan is the man of the match.,15
RCB is my #2 team but how so much do I want them to lose the next two games,6
I think MOM is always unfair.,7
Bollywood people should hire IPL script writers. They are too good this year. I also think they they don't let RCB win today to keep things interesting.,11
"Pollard is the most free speaking captain in IPL. Saying Bumrah wanted new ball but was denied, even-odd year memes etc. Dhoni used to do it too until CSK started playing badly and he started getting defensive.",28
"Bruh some people in post match thread are saying Boult is leaving...

Is it true?",8
I will also remind you folks that Stoinis is not a finisher which folks won’t let me say because he finished 2 matches. He opens or doesn’t play in my team. And that was always the case.,10
Mi NRR go nrrrrr,19
Why is Ishan MOTM?,12
"I have been CSK fan since I started watching IPL , started liking KXIP last year and avidly supporting KXIP this year . CSK , pls don't fuck this up for KXIP . PLEASE",8
Are they gonna give bowlers any credit in this tournament. Bumrah and Boult were terrific and man of the match is Ishan... Seriously,19
why does DC play well in the first half of the season and play shit in the second.,4
No Motm for Boomrah/Boult. Ballasphemy!!,20
Ayyy dc and csk homies together in this,13
"To all those who were looking for me, I have more guts than this team because I show up even in their shit show. Life is long and I will have my time. I am happy to wait it out!",-4
I thought DC could do nothing more to disappoint after all these years but I'm still in a bad mood. Fuck this,10
I don't who the fuck chose batsman as the man of the match while two bowlers took 3 wickets and restricted DC to a small score >.<,35
What if I told you C and D are the same letter? Cuz guess who just went back to DD,14
Odd vs even but Pollard forgot it’s 2020,6
"Rooting for dc to be in top 2 , wants them to do well  they are wholesome team , some of their fans did became toxic . Only team I wish shd not win is rcb, Kohli's antics can get in to nerve Ofcourse it's his behaviour that has made him player he's is sure , but as a opposition I do feel  the unnecessary use of mc bc is little overboard  from him agression can be shown in better way",14
"DC have run out of steam. For young team I am surprised at that. They must win last game, just to give them positive momentum for playoffs.",9
Par score here is probably going to be 180ish now.,3
Why is it that the most interesting games are the ones I miss,5
"Fuck my life !! Just when I thought this match is going to be interesting, it started in the most unfortunate way.",3
Rashid makes it a 16 over game every time,11
Match ended before I could watch it. Missed whole match.,9
"collapse incoming in 3,2,1",1
Tatti team hai,3
Thanks for Boult,3
"Saurabh Tiwary be like :

*Ek ball dalna*",8
Anyone here,3
"DC youngsters Shaw, Iyer and Pant have flopped big time. Once Dhawan stopped scoring they are in a bad shape. Even their vaunted bowling line up seemed to have peaked early and are lacking the bite they showed in earlier games. 

I am more annoyed we will be taking out of form players to australia. And player like Surya wont be going . Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",7
"If Kohli and AB took 15 and 10 cr respectively, that would free up 3cr for good Indian middle order batsmen.",6
"After first few overs of the DC innings my inadvertent response was.... ""saalo ki abating ne fir se hag diya.""",2
