"Want to see either SRH or Kings XI take the fourth spot in the play offs, so will be supporting RCB on this occasion,",6
Rcb please win and be on safe side. U dont do well in pressure situations,7
If RCB don't win today they are gonna be in trouble..,5
Even RR and punjab wants rcb to win. So they will lose.,9
"Come on RCB y‚Äôall gotta win it for the other meme teams, meme team represent let‚Äôs go!",16
"Not, ABD or Kohli, the batsman who I found exciting to watch this season has been Pooran.  Just saying.",4
Kkr win this one please. You gotta do it for Lockie,4
"KKR should go with a specialised batsmen if Russel isn't fit, but alas they don't have anyone who can play it in middle order.",2
If finch scores today I‚Äôll gift him a juul for his vape,6
"Rcb,pls win. I swear,I will stop jerking off if you win. Life of rajasthan is in your hands!!!",40
"I mean, if both lose, DC still stands on top. Forgive me for sounding like a pakistani fan but we never get this win. Lemme stay here for awhile",1
"Russel has been a massive disappointment this season. And with their weak bowling line-up, they just went for another batsman. I feel like they will fall out of top 4.",3
"SRH, KXIP, CSK, RR and RCB vs KKR",2
"If not for dugout I'll be not be watching this much IPL. 

 If you're like me a dugout fan please show some love and support by liking, retweeting and commenting on starsport tweets related to dugout.",6
What did Gambhir just say in Hindi show? Something about owner's match? I missed it.,3
"Lol Gambhir. Saying on tv "" RCB ke khilaf harna mujhe bilkul bhi pasnd nahi"" with a 'roni si surat'.",6
"Gill, Tripathi and Rana really have to fire from the start today, a good powerplay score will accelerate the runs for us.

As for bowling, we might get Narine in for today.",6
I hope Finch-Padikkal scores well today.,7
Inb4 the top order fucks up and AB comes to the rescue for the 69420th time,6
If RCB wins this match then they're officially considered qualified right?,6
"I think the day when entire r/cricket supports RCB, they shit the bed. Today is the day!",29
RCB will find a way to fuck this up.,7
"RCB's batting essentially ends at no 4 with AB. I don't think the guys below him could be considered as proper batsmen just yet. I wonder if they might drop Udana and bring in Moeen. He will shore up the batting a bit and also give them another spinning option.

Also, considering Kuldeep is back for KKR, it might be worth a shot anyway lmao.",4
"For KXIP's sake, go RCB!",7
Finch anna pls fire today.,7
99% supporting RCB today,7
"Today's match

KKR vs r/cricket",25
"RCB has everyone's support except MI and DC, so they're going to lose lmao.",11
If finch scored today I‚Äôll buy him a juul,7
"If kkr win today, the rest of the ipl before playoffs will be pretty much useless",5
Cannot wait to let everyone down lmao,30
"Life was so much simpler and contented when there was no RCB cricket for 3 days. But now we're back and it's a big one. Also carrying the hopes of RR and SRH. 

As for the the game, if KKR don't bowl a spinner in the powerplay which they usually don't, this might finally be a decent match for Finchy. 

He's all at sea recently vs proper swing/seam bowlers who hoop it around corners -- The likes of Sandeep Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Boult, Shami etc

While KKR have a pretty decent pace attack, they don't move the new ball a lot and this kinda attack might suit Finch and allow him to play more freely",43
"Lockie vs Finch is what I'm waiting for

Pedo stache vs Pedo face",119
"RCB's team composition this year reminds me of Delhi of 2019. Batting till 4 and a long tail after that. I know that Virat and AB are way more elite than Iyer and Pant but RCB doesn't have Rabada.

They really need to figure out that middle order.",2
"RCB fans here doing their best to reverse jinx tgeur team to Victory.

No other team has that complex fanclub.",8
It doesn't matter if you win or lose rcb. You will forever be my meme team. Peas!!,4
[deleted],32
"The overseas players who were included in the playing XI very late in the season but helped their team a lot:

Gayle, Lockie, Morris",6
Just start the match already!!!!! I cant hold excitement for an entire hour more!!,11
"So hear me out. I'm not saying that IPL shouldn't grow and prosper but I wouldn't support a 10 team IPL. Now only reason I'm watching today's game is 'context'. When you're watching IPL, the excitement of the new season takes you through the first 2 and a half weeks. After that, every game assumes a certain significance because it impacts where your team stands on the table. So you get your calculators out and play out scenarios and root for a certain team every game. 

Now with a 9 or 10 team IPL, each game is less significant because you have more games. And that's why with football leagues because not much changes in 2 weeks of missed games, it's okay if you miss those games. Whereas you can end up in the top or bottom half with a single win/loss in the IPL. This qualifying scenario context becomes significant towards the end of the league in a larger league.

That's why I think IPL should stay an 8 team tournament.",5
"I want KKR to win as an MI fan so that we have less competition for a top 2 spot. 

However, a KKR win would screw up KXIP‚Äôs chances of making the playoffs. 

I‚Äôm going to hate watching this match so much!ü§£ü§£",8
Gambhir being Gambhir in the Hindi show.,2
"Pls RCB, win this one. Keep the points table interesting, give hope to the meme teams.",10
"Can't believe I'm saying this, go RCB",14
"A KKR win makes it very difficult for anyone in the bottom half of the table to crack top 4, so RCB better win just to keep things spicy",4
"I want RCB not only to win, but to screw up KKR's NRR. This will open up the tournament further more and competative.",13
"Three possibilities for CSK comeback:


Dubai to Chennai

Abu Dhabi to Chennai

Sharjah to Chennai.",128
It's been long time since Koach 100 in T20. Gotta do it someday.,5
Any chance of Banton getting a game today?,1
Big match today lads,5
Win it for  Smith,8
"Unpopular opinion but i would like to propose a few changes in the batting line-up:

Padikkal

Kohli (this is where he got four centuries)

Moeen 

Abd

Finch

Morris

Dube

Sundar

Siraj 

Chahal 

Saini",1
"Wow, Never seen so many teams support an RCB win like today!",18
Literally everybody's rooting against us lol.,139
"When you expect RCB to win, they lose.",9
[deleted],1
"The most rcb thing to happen now would be that kkr and kxip make the top 4, while they are left out

Unlikely but it'll be hilarious if that happens",6
Hope both teams have a great game today....as long as KKR wins!,7
I cannot in my life believe I have to support a meme team. But go RCB!,9
Just subscribed to dugout...they don't have the pre match show?,2
Reckon RCB should chase?,3
"It seems most of the sub members are supporting ""opening up the tournament further more and making it more competitive"" POV 

KKR Supporters: *fuming with anger*

RCB Supporters: *emotional due to such an enormous support*",9
So if rcb loses today kxip has no chance to qualify ?,3
Everyone's expecting rcb to win? I have a bad feeling about this,32
"GG making a couple of solid points about Narine inclusion,

Basically to paraphrase, he's saying that the management won't think of this as a must win since they can still lose a couple and qualify. 

Also, he'll be under tremendous pressure and scrutiny with respect to his action. If he bowls overs -- 7,9,11 and 13 where batsmen look to play him out and not take too many risks he can settle down quickly and not bowl that quicker ball that usually gets him in trouble action wise. 

However if they use him while defending a 160-170 score and he's bowling the death overs like he did in the two close matches KKR won, he may revert to type especially if someone like AB or Virat puts him under pressure and thus resulting in another warning which is an automatic ban.",3
I dont feel so good.,11
The matches which decides the fate of 5 teams. Let's go.,4
"On behalf of all the r/cricket intellectuals, ill comment your unique observation in advance

""Unpopular opinion :khOli iS a bAd cApTain""",9
"So much support for rcb?

We're going to bottle this to show who's the real meme team",7
Kkr you have my support (‚äÉÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅ‚Äø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)‚äÉ,4
Expecting koach to make some controversial changes in the squad,9
"I think with finch opening, the oppostion team is tempted to open with a spinner. But, I wonder whether KKR will do that today. Lockie and Cummins from the two ends might be a better option.",1
Lost toss,2
" CricBuzz - **Koushik Karthikeyan**: With 3 left handers in top six if Narine is playing today, RCB should try replacing Udana with Moeen Ali. It will give the middle order some much needed solidarity and also handy off spin options in the middle overs. Siraj might replace Shahbaz.",2
KKR bat... RCB chases,10
"Russell not playing

See ya KKR",6
Banton coming in! Hopefully he doesn't disappoint this time.,3
Banton in for? Russell?,2
Siraj in,2
No green game this year for RCB?,5
Siraj playing:(,6
RCB are fucked chasing today.,3
"KKR are batting

Banton in for Russell, Prasidh in for Mavi

Siraj in for Shabaz Ahmed",5
Bruh I wish someone loved me as much as Virat loves Siraj,61
Why don't they straight up ask about team changes instead of all this chatter.,-1
Wonder why KKR roped in Tim Seifert. They already have Banton who plays a similar role.,2
"This is iconic. A KKR team without Narine and Russell. That is some ballsy move!

This would have NEVER happened if DK was the captain.",-2
"Kohli if you bring this home, I'll name my future baby after you. 

A white kid being named Kohli in the middle of Switzerland would be hilarious on hindsight though",21
Lord Siraj in tf,6
This game is over. Kkr have done KXIP a huge fucken favor with no Russell. Come on Poonjab. I believe in you. Make it happen you fuckers.,0
"Banton back in

Assuming Tripathi drops down the order again. Yikes",4
Bbl hit playing. Good luck winning kkr!,3
Siraj is back :((((,11
Where i can find good fantasy team making suggestions?,2
"Since Banton's playing, I would want him to open considering Gill's SR in powerplay.",3
Atleast there's no narine,3
Udana getting yet another match!,2
Kkr saving Narine for finals.... Who's gonna tell em there'll be no finals if he isn't playing,5
Vipsuperover is cringe af,3
Why siraj? WTF,8
Siraj. Wtf RCB,5
"*Banton in the playing XI*

English Fans : *Our time has come!*",3
What the actual fuck Virat??Siraj again??Why do you keep playing him.What great has he done in the games he's got that he keeps coming back.For fucks sake Kohli learn from your mistakes,6
"With Siraj coming in.

I can smell the disappointment in RCB fans. üòä",11
I thought Banton was an opener,2
Remember when in CWC19 when all of us thought Morgan side won't be playing semis but they went on to win the tourney?,5
Kkr without narine gives me flashbacks of ganguly's kkr. I don't like it.,5
Who was dropped for Siraj?,1
Fuck me not Siraj again man,4
"Banton gets another chance, that too against the same team he couldn't do well?

Justice for joe denly",7
Why the fuck do we keep bringing in Prasidh. He hasn't done shit for two years,0
Is Nagarkoti injured or just dropped?,1
Swanny's makeup artist having a shocker,3
Kkr drops Russell. Koach returns the favor by including Siraj. Stoppable force meets moveable object.,73
"I think Banton & Tripathi should open, and Gill should come at Number 3.",5
A win will make sure RCB qualifying for playoffs. So the stage is set for them to fuck up.,5
Justice for Shivam Dube,23
From Cricinfo: This is the first time since April 2012 that KKR are playing a match with both Narine and Russell missing,7

"Siraj and Jadhav both have blackmail on their team management.

CMV.",8
">Mohammed Siraj in for Shahbaz Ahmed

RCB supporters: Arey mujhe chakkar aane laga hai",15
Google scorecard so confused where to keep banton that they just put him at 10,5
siraj has been decent this season i dont mind,6
Watch Banton play a great knock today and securing his place in the team.,7
"If I see Gill bat like that again, i would need to bleach my eyes.",5
"We need to win this, not just for ourselves but for KXIP, RR, SRH and even the neutrals who do not want dead rubber games at end of tournament",6
"According to The Telegraph, R Ashwin is all set to make his return in India's Limited Overs squad for series against Australia.",10
"With all this (justified) shitting on Gill, everyone's forgotten about how crap Rana has been. No. 3 is a crucial spot in a T20 batting line up, you can't make measly scores at that position and expect the team to post big totals. High time he steps up.",5
Bringing in Banton seems like a way to push things in the powerplay!,1
"> We have one change, Siraj comes back

Why?",2
Siraj has kohlis nudes that's the only explanation,9
"I am gonna say it, sundar is overrated and virat also sees it",3
What does KkR mean?,2
[deleted],19
Interesting to see Udana has been given a rather long rope by RCB. He consistently leaks runs and hasn‚Äôt done much with the bat. Are there any foreign alternatives?,2
Our batting after AB is non existent,6
"I can't even imagine how Baz is approving Gill on top, he himself was super aggressive in his later career.",3
Banton has poor form but KKR doesn't have too many options now,3
Morgan vs Kohli again,1
[deleted],6
"I don't mind playing siraj, but if he gets hit please don't let him bowl another over. His expensive overs are literally game changers",3
Never thought I'd be scared for Kohli in a chase. Oh how the turn tables!,7
"From 105/0 in powerplay in 2017

To 30-40 in 2020.....kkr has come a long way",6
"What did Sahbaaz do to get dropped?

Small boundary size maybe the reason?",0
"Imagine how good Siraj would sleep every night knowing no matter how much he fucks up, Kohli will pick him again",11
"While I might not necessarily subscribe to the whole Matchups‚Ñ¢ theory, that's the reasoning behind Siraj for Shahbaz Ahmed

Hesson and the management don't want the left arm spinner who primarily bowls in the middle overs to bowl to two lefties in the KKR batting line-up.",6
">This is the first time since April 2012 that KKR are playing a match with both Narine and Russell missing

*ESPNcricinfo*",42
Why won't Siraj and Umesh fuck off,3
If Cummins and kuldeep bowl well today RCB in trouble,9
Why does Kohli hate Dube so much,3
Who is Manvinder Bisla?,3
The official version is that Narine and Russel are not 100% fit,2
 Watch siraj get more overs than udana again,3
"I have my finals in a month but on god, I'm more stressed for this game",4
i see a lot of siraj bashing but dude has been half decent this season,4
So banton is batting at 6 today to counter Saini and Morris at the end,3
Good to see Kohli encouraging talents like Siraj and backing them up,10
"This is big match for Kuldeep, to be honest. I think if he gets trashed, he will again be left out from the next match.
Good news for him is that Moeen Ali is not playing.",5
"@all non-kkr and rcb fans ffs stop supporting rcb, we'll shit the bed for sure now",9
"Might just be a good toss to lose, games aren't bat first- win game anymore",2
We are playing with only 5 bowlers.,3
What has Dube done wrong to be dropped?,2
when will this this nightmare end :(,1
"Oh dear, Lord Siraj is in the squad. I'm terrified now.",0
Koach gonna be oblivious to how udana's been less that mediocre until the finals when he concedes 24 of the last over to only say next year is ours,2
"Wait... Russell is not playing today? Well, I am not complaining. lol.",1
Who's nudes is finch holding to be able to play so many matches despite no performance? Could have gone with Parthiv patel - atleast he hits much better and plays dots less,2
Good to see Tom 'cube-head' Banton given another go,5
"He is great in domestic red ball cricket, hopefully he will improve and do well in t20s",2
What disappointment Russell has been this season after last year's heroics. Gayle and Pollard are clear of him as true legends of t20 just because of their consistency.,8
Hope that Banton and Tripathi open and Gill comes out at 3.,3
"I want to see Steyn one more time.


Udana is fine & all, but Steyn firing will be the cherry on top for RCB's AbD cooked cake",6
"I don't fancy our chances tonight. Playing with only 5 bowlers, 2 of whom have been absolute dogshit this tournament.",3
"Finally I can watch Banton bat live 

Missed the last time",4
"Gill vs Siraj will be interesting 

Stoppable force meets movable object",18
Why isn't dube playing?? Should play in place of gurkeerat imo,8
"Morgan needs to bring that ""Keep attacking"" philosophy of England to KKR side... They are behind the eight ball right from the start in every game, till now, they relied on Russell to catch up later (which didn't work), but today they don't even have that cover.",4
MI literally won two IPL‚Äôs with Parthiv opening. It‚Äôs great that ABD is able to manage keeping while batting this year but I hope it doesn‚Äôt take a significant toll on him later. Parthiv really isn‚Äôt that bad.,6
"Gambhir on Star Sports ""There is no rivalry b/w KKR and RCB because KKR has won 2 trophies and RCB zero.""",82
I want KKR to lose so things get more interesting in the table üòè,7
"so many of ya'll shitting on Siraj, the probable contender for 5th seamer in test squad",9
.,10
"God I want RCB to win but I want this game to be a godawful, delirium inducing, gut wrenching meme fest!!!",9
Siraj is the best raw talent right now cut him some slack he'll be better than that chucker named Bumrah,6
Come on RCB. All of our hopes rest on you,6
Could a Kannadiga bro help tell me what the Kannada lyrics in this year's RCB anthem mean?,5
Calling it now - this will be a very very high scoring game,5
"A win without Narine & Russell in their playing 11 will give KKR a lot of confidence. But unfortunately ABD, Chahal & Kohli are just too good for this side. Im all in for a surprise but I know RCB is winning this one.",3
Where are all my fellow KXIP supporters backing RCB today at?,5
Everything rooting against us. Probably we can win then. Lol,10
"Here's my pre-match prediction. 

KKR to make around 185-188. Their batting will finally work well as a unit. 

RCB chasing will end up with 172. 

Varun C MoM: 3/13",10
Starving for a Koach chase.,12
RCB's allrounders have been so good that they can afford to play an specialist 6th bowler in Siraj.,27
#,2
So with Banton in the side he might be entrusted with giving them a quick start and Gill will be shuffled into the middle order? Or will Tripathi be demoted?,3
Who is better? Lord Siraj or Lord Umesh? ü§î,3
RCB needs to win today to save the last third of this IPL from becoming full of dead rubbers.,7
Need RCB to win this but I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre giving Banton another chance,7
"Gambhir on Star Sports Hindi Pre-Show - ""There is no rivalry between KKR and RCB because KKR has won 2 trophies and RCB zero. Let RCB win a trophy first, and then we will talk. It cannot be called a rivalry. I don't like losing to RCB at all.""

GG always speaks his mind and doesn't give a shit to whatever others think. GG is OG",5
">Sunil still not 100%

But he wasn't out due to a injury, no?",1
Do tom Banton eats bats for breakfast??,-1
Siraj to bat before AB today,8
The commentar talking about Gill's 70*(62). Is it even a good t20 inning?,1
I feel this match has RCB written all over it.,1
Tripathi and Gill opening,2
Siraj vs gill...... Immovable object vs unstoppable force,9
[deleted],11
Eoin Morgan will send all three Tripathi Banton and Gill to open.,6
"Logistically speaking, who should srh fans be supporting today?",6
Lmao RCB fans are saying KKR will win and KKR fans are saying RCB will win.,72
I think Dube>Gurkeerat. But he can shut me up today,10
Strange to see ABD speak first in the team huddle followed by Kohli,2
"Cap Morgan 2 toss 2 wins

Have been saying kkr changed their captain for toss luck",5
"Come on KKR, Win this for Gauti. Although everything he praises turns into shit. His latest praise was for Dhawan. Now there'll be a slump in his form",7
What happened to Russel and Narine?,2
Why do they bench mavi again and again? He has been more impactful than Cummings and I feel like he will be the face of kkr more than gill,11
Tripathi ane Gill opening,6
[deleted],1
"Siddesh Lad is by no means a very special batsman but was looking forward to him getting a game or 2 with KKR this year.

If Gill doesn't do much, Lad can be brought in. Gill might be a great talent but right now it's not working.",4

There is too much self-loathing in this place. I'll still proudly say our CSK will qualify for play-offs,2

Gill can play slow today as much as he wants!,1

Throwback to when umesh took sky and kishan in the same over,9
"Given his unbelievably shite record in Asia (he averaged what 12 in the PSL?) I feel Tom Banton might very well be playing for his immediate future in the IPL in the next few games. IPL franchises hardly pick proven Asian failures in their squads so should Banton fail this season, I have a strong feeling he might go unsold next year or next couple of years until he gives a reason for teams to pick him. 

He has been outstanding in the Vitality Blast and he's had an okay ish BBL season, but rn with him there is more hype than actual performances.",6

r/cricket has meme'd Siraj into performing. We have peaked.,9
Can the commentators praise Siraj for his bowling instead of just attributing everything to Kohli...,12
Holy shit Siraj...,5
Name a bigger story of woe than ‚ÄòKKR chose to bat‚Äô,3
Double wicket maiden boys,5
"Siraj is a better bowler in first class (has good stats with India A too) and his bowling will suit test matches. 

But the current test bowling squad is too good for him to get a breakthrough there. he will have to wait his time. 

LOIs / T20 are wrong format for him and gives a chance for people to mock him.",7
6th bowler is destroying KKR batting line-up,10
Siraj was the imposter,5
Ah I see. So this is why siraj is considered as a good red ball bowler . is it the case he might be playing wrong format for india ?,7

Please take Siraj to Australia üò¢ (not saying this based on his IPL form),1
"Siraj has always been an outstanding red-ball bowler. In all fairness, he has been unlucky to have not gotten an India cap after the season he had in 2017 and 2018. Not surprising that he's thriving in helpful conditions. It's just that he has never been a white ball bowler, and unfortunately he's been exposed badly when the conditions have been flat.",4

Sorry to shit on young player but Gill is overrated as fuck. From what I've seen so far he can't do shit against quality bowling or in swinging conditions,4
Gautam Gambhir was criticising Kohli why would he bring in Saini for 3 over and next delivery he strikes,5

Please cross 49. Please cross 49. Please cross 49.,9
r/cricket will undergo a meltdown if somehow RCB bowls out KKR on 48,8
Yesterday I saw somewhere siraj is considered for Australia tour and now this happens,7
Siraj averaging out his career economy,5
2020 really do be weird man.,5
"KKR's batting frailties have been mercilessly exposed here.  
If the FUTURE OF INDIAN CRICKET is your top scorer then you're not making it to top 4.  
They have to play for NRR here",1
Will KKR cross 49?,2
Siraj statpadding like crazy here,4
Mohammed Siraj 2-2-0-3 NEVER FORGET!!!,9
"Siraj with 2-2-0-3...

What the actual fuck!!",13
Siraj already has 101 fantasy points in just 2 overs,9
"We are having a colder winter than usual this year because of La Nina.   
Revenge is best served cold mhmm.",0
"SIRAJ!
IDU IDU!!

KEIDBIDU MAGA AVRNA.",5
Who gave a silver to this match thread?,2
This is a special performance from Siraj. Never saw it coming from someone like him.,4
Well I just tuned in and errr... damn,5
Lockie gonna feast on this pitch bois,4
"2 - 2 - 0 - 3

Siraj you beast!",6
"Guys, I've been following the score on cricinfo and the wickets keep falling. Wondering if I should start watching or that'll jinx it?",1
RCB is gonna take revenge of 59 all out twice in the same season,2
Siraj with 3 wickets and 0 runs in 2 overs as expected.,5
"KKR has no top order, just vibes",3
Karnataka & Karnataka A both back in great form,7
PLUMB,2
Make Siraj bowl four overs on the trot lol,4
"look KKR, I wanted you lot to lose. But this might be a bit too much lmao",5
"Come on, that's out.",1
Banton is clearly 10x as good as Gill I've decided,2
"Siraj with the best bowling I've seen this IPL, better than Lockie Ferguson's on Sunday.",2
That bowl Siraj bowled to Rana was just beautiful,4
Imagine bhuvi/anderson bowling in these conditions,2
We are living in 2020 whereas Siraj is already moved onto 2050,4
Leg byes aren‚Äôt included in runs conceded by bowlers?,4
Anyone hoping for 49/10?,7
Siraj going to have some legendary bowling figures if this keeps up,2
Wow.... pitch is doing a lot of movement.,1
No way Siraj or any of the bowlers can peak this. Should just retire now.,5
Morris bowls 140 km per hr so casually. Only person more casual I can think of is Jofra,2
"So, Siraj's gonna play against australia..m",3
"So this pitch favours bowling? Since siraj can swing the ball,Cummins can be fire tonight right?",2
I'm here for a Siraj fan club tbh,5
"Putting the memes aside, this doesn't look like an easy track to bat on. KKR probably won't go down without taking some wickets",2
"Tuning in late to check Siraj 3-0 in 2 overs. Wow, that's insane. 

Me realising the host broadcaster using a more Aussie style of graphic and it's actually 3 wickets and 0 runs and not the other way round

Mind = blown",4
So...who else didn't picked Siraj in their Fantasy team?,10
Siraj is gonna come back to original form in the finals. Isn‚Äôt he? üò¢,5
Has to be out.,-1
"SIRAJ WHAT IS YOUR SECRET, HOWWWWW",0
I will never forget this match. Lol.,1
Even the umpire be like no way they can get 5 out so quick,3
"Boy does this team need a complete rebuild. This is like the 5th time our batting is collapsing, only difference is that the collapse is getting worse by the game.",2
KKR chose to bat....,1
[deleted],2
Its plumb unless bat involved,1
Come on I want more Siraj,2
Too high,1
Archer who?,2
Siraj's ER is 0 holy shit,2
Too high,1
Umpire's call?,1
"Umm KKR decided to bat, so they kinda knew what to expect from the pitch. But God damn they didn't expect this üòÇüôèüèº",2
KKR have no top 4. Their batting starts at 5.,3
Siraj got rid of the headband. That's like a +1000 bowling skill upgrade.,8
"Not out, too high",2
Drs,0
Not out,0
RIP to nrr bois,3
"Ok, who gave Siraj the cheat console?",2
finch wearing two caps.... my new mantra,2
Too high!,1
Ooooooft that was close.,3
That's a shit ass review,1
Pussy umpire,4
ABD looks like a Florida based lumberjack,8
Wtf is this heartbeat sound??!,1
2-2-0-3,6
Wtf. Just returned from school and wtf. Revenge time yay,8
Looked plumb,3
"Fuck, that's not fair.",6
Too high maybe,2
Funny thing I have noticed Siraj bowls from 132-142 kph ofcourse mixed with some slower balls. Tells you how playing 50+ First class games have made him more accurate on pitching ball at 4-6 metre length. Great üëå,7
"Wow, what a chad umpire. Went straight to ball tracking",23
Everyone‚Äôs been saying pitches have been flat this year so now the UAE pitch caretakers bring the most spiciest green track,3
Finally no ultra edge needed,2
Oh I would‚Äôve loved another wicket here just for the memes.,11
RCB are winning the IPL,9
"Just tuned in, WHAT THE FUCK 15-4???",10
I never thought I would see KKR collapsing like this. This is insane. And fun to watch.,4
Unlucky :(,6
If this was an anime. The top order sacrificed themselves for DK & Morgan to solve their issues over the pitch. Tears gonna roll any second now.,3
 the best redemption in the IPL history lmfao,2
Harsha  be like : kya ji miya. Aaj tum kya khake aaye?,6
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jcvo2j/post_match_thread_rcb_vs_rr/g93tj85/

Y'all were clowning on me with 15 downvotes last post-match thread, who's the fool now bitch.",13
Wtf is happening? Did Siraj just pick 3 wickets!!,2
commmmmon :'((((,3
going over,0
Karthik got lucky with that call...,7
2 overs 2 maidens 3 wickets remember the stats lmao,4
"Wise men don't need ultra-edge

Finally a good 3rd umpire. Short concise and precise",8
What the fuck is an umpires call?,7
Love when 3rd umpires don't waste time with ultraedge when the ball is clearly missing the bat,73
Fuck the umpire.,6
"If it was given out , it would have stayed out fuck 49 was on",11
Close,1
Siraj is such a natural wicket taker when you give the bowlers even an iota of help from the pitch or in the air.,1
This is why the ball needs to dominate the bat. Only then can the really good batsmen shine.,9
So close,3
[deleted],12
Tbh... I'm scared how we're going to fare here next,6
I use IPL as escapism from Pakbros then see this football scorecard shit,6
McCullum sack incoming,4
Not everyday you see a guaranteed MoM in first 4 overs,31
As of right now the target is 50,6
"Damn, literally missed the lbw by an inch.",14
Can we see a Eoin Morgan hundred today?,8
Kol(lapse)kata,5
"If only kkr had Cameron ""First class average of 55"" green coming in to save there ass and not that fraud chucker Chris green.......",2
Where were you when KKR kill,10
WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED JOINING NOW,10
Peak 2020 is when Kohli did not argue with the umpire after it was Umpire's call,12
This agressiveness. This agressiveness is what we want against Australia.,8
Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God I saw what Siraj did and had to come on here lmao,3
"InB4 KKR 48/10

&#x200B;

Result : KKR won by 1 run",4
VK is like surprised every ball that doesn't get a wicket.  üòÅ,11

"Baz in his notebook*

Oh come on that was so close,0
Has anyone ever bowled back-to-back maidens in the IPL before?,7
[deleted],5
All out by 50 for the meme,3
"Ha fools! Siraj is just lord tewatia with a mask, to show he can do everything",5
This should confirm Siraj over fuckin Shardul for series down under,8
Thanks KKR,4
[removed],20
"When the Fwb the Umpire has gets a call from him to hit the sack, her friends teasingly call it an umpire's call.",1
Just hope we cross 49 now,9
"Shocking how many people in these threads don't know what umpire's call is

Who do you think you are, Michael Holding?",4
Siraj confirmed in that flight to Aus?,13
I hate this umpire call shit. It should be either out or not out,12
"Would love to see Pat Cummins bowl on this wicket too, won't get a better pitch this IPL",8
I don't think it is a suprise. Siraj always bowled test length in all every match irrespective of pitch. Today his test length matched the pitch,7
"I'm actually shedding a tear. I never thought our bowling would ever be this good, even for one game",22
"Kohli loves test pacers. Siraj, Saini and Yadav are great First Class bowlers but it always doesn't translate to limited over success.",6
What's the lowest powerplay score in the history of IPL?,2
40 matches in and still fast bowler are having their say. Pitch Curators deserve a raise. Also if next year we are gonna have closed door games in India let's have them in UAE again. Excitement Unlimited üî•,2
Lol Morgan. No technique.,3
Abd's pep talk at the start of innings made the difference.,5
"What Siraj really needed was a new ball.

That's all.",6
This team doesn't deserve to be in the top 4 playing like this. I hope Punjab continues their streak and qualifies instead.,3
Nice to see bowlers dominate for a change. Even low scoring thrillers are fun to watch,3
Legends say Baz has finished every notebooks produced by Classmate and is switching to Camlin to finish their stock.,8
"Getting strong 49 all out vibes, kkr made just 130 runs and rcb looked confident to chase it... but well",4
"Just saw scorecard and mfw, I saw spell of Lord Siraj.",5
inb4 we fail to chase 49,5
Umpire's call only if it hits bails aye?,3
They're bowling is on point tonight. Everything around the top of off stump.,3
Gya mera dream11,6
Cummings will come and show their batsman how to play cricket. Another 50 for him i think.,2
Stat alert: Siraj is the first-ever bowler to bowl two maidens in one IPL game.,7
" **Mohammed Siraj is the first man ever to bowl two maidens in one IPL game.**

Further proof that this is just a simulation and the creator is high.",94
Give Koach a competent bowling attack and watch him be in his element.,8
and just how dick of a move it was from DK to throw away his wicket.. you had one job fucker,5
"Good on Kohli, they should go in for the kill. If Morgan settles, they could easily lose control of this match.",5
"What other overseas players do we have ? So far all but 2 of them have been useless or mediocre , Green , Russell , Banton , Cummins all have been average.

Narine and Lockie are only ones who've won matches , Morgan is ok .",3
Siraj 3-0 (2)? yeah insert <2020>,7
Bring the SIRAJ next over,3
"If siraj can do well, udana can be replaced with another foriegner, philipe or moeen, solving middle order problems",11

Dada is gonna announce a mega auction next year after this shithousery.,8
"**Mohammed Siraj is the first man ever to bowl two maidens in one IPL game**

*ESPNcricinfo*",231
Siraj : 2-2-0-***3***. Half-life 3 Confirmed.,10
Not sure if RCB is making KKR look like Bermuda or if KKR is making RCB look like peak Pakistan,3
Apple should handover a free ipad pro and Apple pencil to Baz. Free marketing with the number of times they show him writing notes.,4
Cannot believe we still get complaints about the existence of umpire's call this far into having DRS,3
Siraj is the bowler version of Tewatia,2
Remember that meme bowlers like Umesh Yadav and Piyush Chawla dismantled RCB then now Siraj is paying back,6
I mean Kohli is great test captain.,13
This is Morgan's team alright. Can't play when conditions suit the bowlers.,4
What's the lowest powerplay score in IPL? and in T20s overall?,2
Give Siraj one more,1
RCB players are pumped.,1
"Morris saying nice call to the umpire, we're going to lose some fair play points but who gives a fuck.",4
3 maidens out of 5 overs in powerplay. Lol KKR.,5
I hope they get Siraj back,3
Absolute shit show of a performance by KKR. Kings XI deserve the 4th spot tbh.,11
Scriptwriters giving siraj character development,18
"Joke's on you, RCB. Now you're stuck with Siraj for the rest of the tournament.",4
Incredible bowling incredible fiedling the kohli approach aggressive cricket. What is this sudden change.,1
"If someone told that Siraj will bowl 2  maidens and take 3 wickets in powerplay, no RCB fan (and no KKR player) would believe it. With all the shit bowling performances in earlier seasons, this is a dream bowling line up for RCB.",3
What is umpire's call? Does it mean that even though it's out just because umpire initially gave not out it would remain that way? Weird!,1
Expecting silly point from next over. For shits and giggles,1
yes one more Siraj over pls... FUCK THEM WHEN THEY ARE DOWN,0
Why did it go to umpire‚Äôs call even when it was hitting the wickets but their review was retained?,1
This is some 90s Pakistan level bowling attack,14
"""Mohammed Siraj is the first man ever to bowl two maidens in one IPL game"" - Unbelievable",7
Holy fuck! Just tuned in and it seems Siraj is killing it!,8
"So, today's the day RCB finally get to a positive NRR then?",4
Siraj is the first bowler to bowl two maidens in a match in history of IPL.,6
3 straight maidens,8
"Everyone was complaing about the batting pitches , here we go now",9
I really think more DRS decisions would go his way if Kohli learnt to make a proper T like [Alastair Cook](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/15/article-2364458-1ACF9810000005DC-798_634x357.jpg).,3
">Mohammed Siraj is the first man ever to bowl two maidens in one IPL game

Wow

3 out of 5 overs have been maiden",9
Was supporting KKR but this is too entertaining,3
Run rate of 3 what the actual fuck,4
3 maidens in 4 overs. Is it a record?,3
This is hilarious,2
"15-4 in 5 overs? Lmao, what's the lowest total in the powerplay?",5
"Would be the most RCB thing to lose from here, eh?",1
"When it comes to all-rounders everyone likes talk about big names like Russel, Bravo and Pollard etc.  IMHO Morris is an underrated gem.",3
KKR's first priority now should be not bat till Lunch and not lose any more wickets. They can start attacking once the ball gets old /s,3
**Breaking news** :Mohammad Siraj is the FIRST bowler to bowl two maiden overs in a match in the history of IPL!,10
"I was about to watch the match . My dad told me to eat first i would not miss anything in 10 -15 mins.
He said i won't miss:(.",4
"Wait, no Russell?",2
Figures ruined by that single,4
"r/Cricket : RCB and KXIP are meme teams 


KKR: Talk nah",6
"Suraj doing well in 2020 

Oh my god",1
3of first 5 are maidens. Rcbb u beauty,3
[deleted],3
Noooooo...,2
Morgan and DK to block out the rest of the innings just to avoid getting all out,2
Lowkey wishing RCB take that revenge for 49 all out today.,4
Only a misfield can make lord Siraj concede runs,5
Siraj is the first man ever to bowl two maidens in one IPL game,2
"Morris ruining Siraj's perfect economy, drop him",3
Kohli to Siraj: *Finish them*,4
"Morris 2 - 1 - 3 - 0

Siraj 2 - 2 - 0 - 3

RCB bowlers, which parallel world is this?",3
misfield ruining Siraj's stats :(,6
"So Pat Cummins is going to rip through our top order, isn't he üò•",5
Morgan is gonna chop on isn't he,2
Just play all 20 overs and then give the ball Lockie and Pat the bully.,1
"CSK: ""my best buddy KKR""

wears ""<--- I'm with stupid"" t-shirt",1
"First bowler to bowl 2 maidens in IPL, remember the name : Siraj",6
Mohammed FUCK r/cricket Siraj.,8
This is our best shot to improve NRR and grab top 2 spots. Please Koach and co. Let's not fuck this up,11
Chindi ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•,1
2-2-0-3 That should be Siraj T-shirt label going forward.,5
RCB drag them to hell. Love from SRH.,5
Why doesn‚Äôt Morgan just chop on,3
As an RCBian this feels like an parallel universe shit,11
What the hell happened here,5
Ball swings for more than one over and batsman forget how to bat in t20 lol,5
r/cricket is like r/wallstreetbets but cricket players instead of stocks,9
"God I have seen what you've done for others!

Want same swinging conditions when MI's pace battery of Bumrah, Boult, Pattinson/Coulter Nile is bowling.",1
Kkr has been shit the whole tournament. They've been winning most of their games due to sheer luck(KXIP and CSK) and one man performances(Tripathi). Punjab definitely deserves the spot over them,3
Siraj is taking wickets so no need to bowl him in the death overs ... win-win situation,3
Kohli is still thinking he has to defend about 49,9
What is the lowest total in power play till now in this ipl ?,3
KKR's best batsmen yet bat. Could go either way until they get Cummins out.,3
Two more wickets and Chahal and Sundar to clean up the tail,5
Not really worried about India in the next t20 world cup judging by some of the shit batting in this tournament. England and Aussies should be able to roll them.,-1
2019 World cup semifinals match vs New Zealand reminder anyone???üòÇüòÇüòÇüò¢üòì,5
One Mandatory wicket coming after the Strategic timeout.,1
memes if KKR scores 49,6
Goddamnit I was hoping for four maidens. Karthik you killjoy,7
I remember the 49/10 allout match where we thought they will easily chase down 131 set by KKR.,9
Morris has been very good for RCB. He brought that much needed calmness and reliability,3
Siraj without headband > Siraj with headband,10
Almost killed Karthik.,11
"Siraj went for a run

Drop him.",45
"Siraj:

*Friendship ended with dinda. Bumrah is my new best friend.*",13
KKR saved himself twice,3
A good test innings from Morgan so far.,9
What‚Äôs happening lmao,9
Is Hotstar feed little choppy today,1
DK got spread like mayo twice in the span of 15 seconds,10
[removed],20
It‚Äôs all in the headband,10
Um guys... KKR have Cummins and lockie,8
How do players bounce back from this kind of performance in 3 days time. Last week they dealt with a captaincy change and lost their best two performers over last 4-5 years. And all this when a struggle for qualification is on the cards. IPL is a much tougher tournament than it seems.,10
Everybody is trying to kill DK,13
I will take this over boring 125-5 anyday,27
Poor Karthik getting fucked from both ends.,8
hahahahah he dived twice,4
Morris using height advantage,6
"If Siraj, a good red ball bowler is bowling this well it could be finally Pat Cummins' match this IPL as a bowler",17
Morgan thinking it's baseball or something,4

The double dive lol,6
What's Siraj's speed like usually?,3
What the fuck is this stance from murugan?,5
Whats the lowest runs conceded by a bowler in a T20 match?,3
Smart batting by Morgan. He knows whose bowling to him.,8
daddy siraj,2
Morris just wants Kartik out..even if it means hitting him in the head with a wild throw,3
Can't have a death over problem if the game doesn't go to the death overs,12
I think we exhausted all of our luck against KXIP now there's only sadness,5
"I just tuned into the match... Something is wrong with my brain, I see Siraj has 3 wickets for no runs...

Can someone tell me the actual score? I'm scared...",14
Siraj leaving the Dinda academy and joining the Bumrah academy bois,10
Love the energy!,6

If Bangalore win will they become 2 or stay 3?,7
Just after the toss me and my friend made fun of Kohli's decision to take in Siraj. He's made us eat our words.,8

"Rcb backed Siraj, even though there wasn‚Äôt a spark in him. But he came good in the end. Nice process from Rcb.",42
Dafuq are those figures.,2
Morgan's batting stance is like Bhimasena waiting with his *gadha* for Duryodhana to emerge out of *Vaishampayana*,7

If that's the 5th lowest powerplay in the IPL I wonder what the lowest is,4
man abd‚Äôs beard is hideous now lol,2
These two should look to play on till tea and then capitalize on the tired bowlers after that,9
Damn you know its rough out there when Morgs has a strikerate of 9,9

i love how Rcb matches are the most entertaining and disappointing ones,4
Udana gonna leak,3
These two need to pull a KKR(Kolkata Kaptaan Rescue) for KKR to compete tonight (or at least avoid an absolute hammering to the NRR),2
I hope RCB win with good NRR.,3
KKR seems like junior cricket team in front of RCB right now.,4

McCullum in next match be like: **Fine I'll do it myself**,16
Payback for 49-10,9
Siraj could go for 6 6s and he still won‚Äôt be as expensive as Kaul vs MI,19
It's satisfying to see change in the bowlers body language after a killer spell,12
I have a feeling rcb will find a way to mess this up,11
Where is Chahal?,1
Udana pls no slower balls.,2
"If Morgan can hold wicket till tea break, KKR can accelerate after that.",8
Lowest powerplay score,4
Yo just checked in and what the fuck rcb. Absolute carnage.,6

You'd think that CSK this year would have lowest powerplay score.,3
1(11). Morgan copying his hero Pujara.,14
"If Kohli has half a brain, he'd bowl out Siraj here. He's shitting gold right now, but he's still mediocre at the death. Make use of his form.",5
"Morris, siraj, washy. RCBs BIG3 for powerplay bowling",3
oh pls tell me srk is here watching this?,11
"Udana knows he isn't gonna be in the next game, you can see it in his face.",14
RCB has got to have the one of the best pace attacks on form ever in the IPL right now..,7
[deleted],4
Can Morgan do a watson 2018?,5
Udana make us proud!,14
"Credit to Kohli for includng siraj....if it was Dhoni ,two temples wouldve been built already",59
well this was all for the third Cummin(s) of the lord,2
"ATM, I am as clueless as deepdas Gupta in my xi ad.",3
3-2-2-3 Siraj OP please nerf,14
The pitch will ease out after lunch. These two have to see the new ball out. Remember RCB have to bat last on this pitch.,10
Woke up to find KKR 17/4 with Siraj having figures of 3-2-2-3. Immediately logged into r/cricket... Peak 2020?,25
What's up with Eoin Singh Morgan?,8
everyone tryna vote out siraj when isuru was the imposter,13
Lesgoo bois.. 48* all out incoming üòÇ,4
imagine if kkr still manage to outscore yesterdays csk score :v,2
"Honestly if KKR somehow reach 150 or something, Cummins and Lockie could cause some havoc if the pitch behaves like this.",11
"Tewatia: there can be only one Lord in the IPL

r/cricket: there is another",45
KKR getting destroyed by Siraj feels almost unreal I still cannot believe it lol,9
"KKR is binary, only 1 or 0, look at the top 4... LMAO",1
Still long way to go for KKR. 50 runs are just too far.,3
Goddamit Udana. Read the room,4
"Cummins will also be bowling on this pitch, will be interesting",5
In b4 SRH fans lament over letting go Siraj!,9
DK must be the most relieved man in the team right now.,3
Were RCB's bowlers historically always good and the Chinnaswamy pitch was fucking them over?,7

Did the get rid of the wicket and big over alerts??,1
Can they go Berserk in the second innings and beat our NRR?,3

"Udana sucks, why even pick him over other overseas players",5
RCB leaking runs here,1
I have a feeling Morgan is gonna take a liking to Udana,7
karthik going through flashbacks when he used to open in england.,6
Imagine what havoc Ferguson will wreck on this wicket,13
Wtf. A boundary. Those are allowed?,12
How does Udana have a worse economy rate than Siraj? Surely Dale Steyn can't be worse than him even if he's past his prime..,3
Udana is quite an average bowler. Mo should be picked ahead of him.,6
A boundary? get udana out,7
"Cant blame KKR really, for me pitch is looking like 4th or 5th day of test cricket.  They should have learnt about pitch more before playing shots.",4
Should‚Äôve got steyn for udana today,9

KKR played out **28 dot balls** in the first **6 overs** (including the 4 wicket balls)...

***Yikes.***",14
"Despite Udana's slower balls, I'd still prefer Steyn",8
Give us a thrilling match KKR,-1

Koach would have had much better record as RCB captain if they have not played at chinnaswamy.,6

6 runs in an over feels like a lot lmao what is happening,14
You know you're in deep shit when a 4 increases your run rate by 33%,44
"MI vs CSK is hyped unnecessarily.

KKR vs RCB is *the* rivalry of this tournament",31
"KKR just losing to RCB to keep tournament alive , Cummins can still score 100 from here. You heard it here first.",2
"fuck it 

mahendra singh morgan",24
Is it swinging a lot?,0
Steyn could do some serious damage in this condition,6
"C'mon Morgan, perfect conditions for you to audition for the England test team",3
Unpopular opinion but Banton should be nowhere near the IPL at this stage of his career.  You can't get someone who barely has any experience in Asia and throw him into the fire.,11
Return of the Downvoter!!,7
Imagine if somebody would've picked Siraj as their Dream 11 captain.,11
"Lol I stopped watching the match after banton got out (the only silver lining of the innings lol )

Has the situation improved any better for KKR ?",7
"This pretty much seals Siraj getting picked as the 5th pacer, if it comes to that.",6
Spin choke time!,1
Terrible bowling by Udana. Conceded 6 whole runs /s,20
It seems like I have been looking for an aggressive captain in Iyer when my man Kohli has been an aggresive captain all along.,9
Waiting for kkr to make changes in the bowling dept because of this collapse.,4
Bring Siraj back!,7
"I just switched my tv on, is that really Siraj bowling?",7
Only in this game is isuru leaking 6 runs a lot,4
"Calling it.

Kkr to win by 82 runs",7
Serial downvoter is a kkr fan,4
Kkr downvoters are here. Can we call them Nokia bots?,6
Please less than 49,4
Is it just me or do those flags look fake?,-2
"No, should've bowled out Siraj.",1
Spin?,-4
Kkr on the downfall and kxip gonna take their spot in the top 4,2
this is just getting better with every over,-1
23 runs in 7 overs is too slow even for an ODI.,5
is kohli saving siraj for the death???,3
Come on. Should have gone for Siraj as he is in mooooddddd,6
I want Siraj to finish his quota,8
udana should be dropped for conceding 6 runs.,3
"No, Kohli does not have a brain, apart from when he's batting.",4
Keep downvoting ima upvote every comment,9

RCB's best bowler is yet to bowl,4
I have a feeling virat is gonna save siraj for death overs....,3
Nice chance for RCB to take a big first innings lead,6
"Next ipl auctions:

KKR buys Siraj, Saini and Morris!",18
i just have a feeling of RCB's gonna struggle too,2
Thala Morgan with 6(16),2
"I am not even kidding, Iyer would have saved 2 overs of Siraj here for the death overs.",8
"Just because I may never be able to say this again, we currently hold the World Cup. And it is due to the sexy man at the crease",9
"Don't mind me, upvoting everyone to counter the asshole who's downvoting everyone",7
"Kohli should have bowled out siraj. He seems to be in a good touch. 

Siraj would not be this effective in depth for sure.",3
Even 50 seems quite far fetched atm,0
Kohli's happy to keep the pressure and let the pacers bowl at kkr,3
61 PROJECTED SCORE LMFAO,18
KKR don't really have a good team balance. Neither match winning players.,4
Kohli should bowl out Siraj.,8
Why not Siraj? He's shit at the death,4
"My boys, Sundar & Chahal not come yet- KKR is neck deep fucked",8
"Imagine facing this madlad and the current Shami in tandem. But thankfully the bowling changes, then the catapulting Bumrah fucking shows up",7
"Honestly, wtf is this team. I dont even know what to say with this team they all just shit the bed simultaneously. Like they see Tripathy lose his wicket and they all just decide lets all shit the bed with him too. I dont even know what we can do to fix this anymore maybe have different openers?",4
Cummins is much better than Rana against quality fast bowling,1
Mohammad fucking Siraj 3.0-2-3 ? Wtf am I even watching ?,11
Can Ferguson bat,8
Top class display of fast bowling,2
I just remembered that they have Ferguson üò≠,10
In hindsight we spent too much on one player when we could have had 2 decent players instead .,2
"serial downvoter is a Lord Siraj hater, FUCK YOU BASTARD",21
I think the downvoter is a salty kkr fan,5
bro I woke up from my afternoon nap to this lmao,4
"Jokes apart, what is the par score in this new pitch and surface? :(",5
Kohli wtf you saving Siraj for.,5
[deleted],0
I apologize to Lord Siraj just for today,6
"On paper, KKR bowlers are clearly better and more experienced. If the pitch is the reason, this might not be so one sided.",6
This is too bad even for village cricket,6
So Siraj takes the 5th bowler spot for Aus tour ?,6
Looks like yet another game where Gurkeerat gets picked but doesn't get to play,7
"Rcb avenging Srh with force, I always knew y‚Äôall were my second favorite",12

Clear 1 meter gap between bat and ball? Nah, fuck that, I want to see ultraegde.",5
"Just go with the opposite of what umpire Ravi has to say, save a lot of time",9

"Darren Ganga: ""Did the right handed-ness play a part in your decisions?""

"Idk what it is ,but KKR hasn't defeated a single side above it in the table and I would not want such a side in the playoffs . 


We had a good run , but our mediocrity is back to haunt us like the good old days",20

Cummins and Fergie would have to bowl first 8 overs to dream of a chance,15
Who is RCB's head coach? Google search showing Katich. Surely can't be when Hesson is there.,6
"Fuckers will get 49, now I'm sad.",17
Hate to say it but rcb probably missed the 48-10 opportunity :(,14
11 more runs to morale victory,10
"Seriously tho Jadhav gets hate for the way he plays fine 

But why not gill 

He is probably the worst batsman even bowlers can bat better than him lol",1

Is this happening because Siraj had the spell of a lifetime/incompetent batting or is the pitch helping a lot?,9
Cummins got lucky twice already.,7

This third umpire is too efficient for his own good.,7

Sundar is the real dot ball merchant.,5

This is very satisfying to watch as a KXIP fan,3
I had to rub my eyes twice to check the scorecard. What the hell,1
"What is this match??

Record no. of reviews

Record no. of maidens",1
Just a reminder to all kkr fans 15.5 crores for him.,2
Can KKR get to 100?,3
This is like watching the bowling team trying to force a win on the final session of a test while the batsmen desperately hold on,6
A T20 match slower than a test match,2

IPL seems so shady lol. I enjoy the games though so no complaints.,2
"Just sort the comments by old and see the number of people shitting on Siraj after the team announcement

There's a reason we're watching TV eating namkeen and they are there in the supporting staff.",14
"I‚Äôm backing RCB too but those are not ‚Äúwrong‚Äù decisions, guys. There really is that much margin of error in DRS predictive ability, so there‚Äôs no point blaming the umpire.",4
You all still watching this shit show? Kkr should somehow just score 50 runs and declare so that they don't have the lowest total,5
STOP the down voting. This is not going to  compensate for bad performance,7
"Gonna tell my kids, this is RCB's bowling attack",12
"Bowler appeals...

Umpires call is bullshit. And why do we even need on field umpires anyways if most of the decisions are second checked by 3 rd umpires anyways.,4
How many maidens so far this match? Gotta be some kind of record,7
Don‚Äôt get too happy RCB fans. I remember when CSK scored 108 and I went to bed thinking it‚Äôs won and woke up to Punjab ending at like 92/9,15
130-140 would‚Äôve been competitive here.,3
"Come on lads. If u tuktuk the best u are getting to is 100 and you'll lose anyways. Atleast hit out and entertain us.

The dream is on boys,3
"So Cummins doesn‚Äôt get deceived, but gets out by trying to hit? LOL",1
Cummins must feel like he got transported to Ranchi 2017,6
"8 runs to win, 4 wickets in hand",11
Imma take teasing lessons from Chahal,6
put some power behind that lmao,3
"There goes another, gotta give credit to Sundar as well. You can't come up after a maidan like that.",7
Narine would have fucked us here. Thank god,6
this match is pure comedy at this point,9
yeah kkr's fucked.,3
Omgüò≠üò≠ ESCN BOIS,8
Just 9 more runs,1
Chahal bowls wide off the crease. Bats man imma head out,6
So you're telling me there's a chance for 49?,9
"**12.3** Chahal to Cummins, OUT,  **40-6**

PJ Cummins c Padikkal b Chahal 4 (17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.52",6
This is just painful to watch now,4
The nightwatchman has gone,2
Dream is still alive boys,7
I Ain't unlessing memes untill rcb scores that wining run,7
Cummins with an important wicket saving test innings of 4(17),3
Lmao I‚Äôve seen teams play faster while saving a test match on the fifth day,6
I remember RCB were 40-6 in that 49 all out match lol,4
"Inb4 2021 Auctions-

*KKR buys Siraj, Chahal, Morris and Saini*",6
F for KKR,2
This is irritating now. Again that wide leg spin and again a catch at long off.,1
best batsman gone rip,2
"KKR needs 10 to win, 9 to draw",6
nags today only using inflate strategy,3
Kkr's best batsman cumdog getting totally foxxed.,2
"Nobody





RCB BOWLERS: COWABANGA IT IS!!!!!!!!!!?",2
"Meanwhile McCullum in the dugout: ""Okay guys who is gonna break the news to those 2 in the middle that it's a fucking T-20 game""",6
This performance is a mutiny done by the KKR team for making Morgan captain,6
Chahal does an arjen robben's cutting inside.,5
Kor-none Lor-none Jeet-none re.,3
The hope for a total of 50 is slim but all hope is not lost,6
Chahal is so fucking good at drawing the batsman into playing that shot. Absolute genius!,7
Only positive is that the margin of defeat won't affect KKR. They already have the worst NRR lol.,4
"49 all out dream is still alive, guysü§û",4
Cummins gonna join the party in KKR dressing room,7
"If kkr win this, I'll name my first born ""knight rider""",10

"49/10, there's still a chance.",2
Always rated cummins,2
"Morgan might as well go fuck it mode now, at least try and get them to 100",2
"I honestly don't want Delhi to face Bangalore in the play offs until the finals. That way, whoever wins, we can both celebrate together. I can already see the fans coming together with signs saying ""Thank you ABD"" in Hindi and Afrikaans and as the match ends they come holding hands together and jumping with the trophy.",6
seems it will be between 60 - 80,4
Is the pitch really that hard to bat on or just braindead shot selection and good bowling? Does KKR have any chance of defending score around 100-120?,4
KKR just lost their best batsman....,7
Lockie is gonna rip rcb batting line up in this pitch.,3
BC at this rate RCB will top the table with unbeatable NRR.,3
Time to get Siraj back in next over,2
KULCHA!,4
KKR needs 10 runs to win.,3
49 is back on the menu bois,7
Four more wickets and at most eight more runs please,7
49 will be avenged today,4
gonna post nudes if KKR 48 allout,23
OMG GUYS IS IT REALLY HAPPENING,4
"How can each and every batsman fuck up so bad? Like the pitch might be a nightmare, but someone gets going a bit na",3
Now they can work on keeping them under 50 lmao,3
"Lowest team score in Powerplay in the IPL:

Kulcha!!,2
"If this was Gully Cricket - Self Declare Magas, you win. lets play next match!!",4
Today everyone team below KKR will rejoice.,5
It's Lockie time surely,3
"As a long term RCB fan, I can't believe how balanced the team it.",6
Genius chahal.,2
Sibling vs Sibling,3
Baz scribbles & scribbles. Get frustrated and tears the book,6
Kul vs Cha time,3
Morgan has been excellent this match so far. It's not often we see batsmen get into the double digits in cricket,6
At this point does Morgan just have to throw caution to the wind and twat as many balls as he can?,6
Siraj should get the 10th over,3
It'll be peak 2020 if RCB manage to bowl KKR out for 49,7
"They're just playing to get par 49 at the moment, then they'll think about the par score lol",5
Kuldeep can bat,1
"Don't know man, supported RCB for too many seasons to be comfortable right now!",8
KULCHA reuniounnn,4
KKR is shittier than Shahrukh Khan's films damn,2
KULvCHA,4
Lockie's gonna bowl so well tonight Shami will be fetching the gatorade for him in the Aus. tour just you wait,4
"no 49 memes bois, they failed us",0
This hurts my eyes,4
Waiting for 48 all out,2
Chahal vs kuldeep time,3
I don't understand how has kkr not been in the bottom 4 all this while,0
"Chahal bowling to Kuldeep, I love this",2
Kuldeep be thiccc,2
8 runs vs 4 wicket. It's getting tight in here,2
Morgan is too good a batsman to not make it to 49.,5
9 to avoid follow on. 4 wickets left. 50 balls left in the day,6
Thank the lord even CSK didn't play this bad,3
[deleted],7
Will RCB enforce the follow on?,3
Ever since Morgan became captain KKR have produced some England-esque batting collapses to make him feel at home,11
"Looking at all these comments, it seems like if KKR scores 49, RCB is gonna feel like they lost the match....

The obsession about 49 is on another level...",4
You fuckers just need 10 runs more. Show them Lockie!!,6
Can't wait for Lockie 6/0 and Cummins 4/0,8
Cooldeep will anchor this innings.,6
42% of the runs KKR has scored in 14 overs was given away by Saini in 2 overs. Poor guy went at an ER of 8.5 when the opposition is going at 3.5.,11
Never thought I would see kulcha going head to head like this.,6
New target is 49.,3
On Tuesday SRK releases KKR's Theme song Jump Jump Jump and on Wednesday KKR Batsman obliges. üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,6
RCB bowled 4 maidens today. Previous highest in a single game was 2.,12
Cumms what were you doing?,1
Wonder who‚Äôs to blame for this performance,1
"This DK guy is a visionary. 

Passed the captainship to Morgan at the right time. Would be very happy that he isn't the captain at this moment.",92
Oh boy!!Total revenge for 49 a.o,2
"Guys, don't worry, the script is well written. You guys will witness the lowest score defended in IPL history today. Yall heard it first here.",15
sala garam kar ke chhor diya (t- they failed us),2
Other bowlers reaping what Siraj sow..,10
Why KKR has drama every year?,4
Which genius thought it was better to play Banton for Russel ?,3
Unless KKR's mystery bowler Varun unleashes some mystery delivery this looks tough for them,6
"I honestly believe we don‚Äôt deserve to be in top 4. In many matches we won, we had a reverse KXIP luck.. where we somehow just won. I believe KXIP is doing better after their downfall and would be nice to replace us. In the end they did beat two of the strongest teams back to back. As much as I love KKR, I think we are not ready for the playoffs. There is no surety when we play like wow, the batting will absolutely butcher or like wow, the bowlers will definitely defend the total. There‚Äôs constant hope like ‚ÄúI hope they won‚Äôt collapse today..‚Äù Not the way to go really.",11
It's like that time of test match when they show team needs to 4 wickets to win lol,10
Is this fr? wut,5
KuLcHA,2
"4 maiden overs so far!

M Siraj 2

C Morris 1

W Sundar 1",12
I was here.,2
dont forget in that 49 all out game ..KKR made 131.,3
Are we going to see this game over before the end of the first power play by RCB? KKR will have to just pack up and go home if that were to happen.,3
"Batsman - prods it reluctantly to mid off  
Fake crowd noise - AAAAAAAAAHAHHAAAAA",5
Morgan denied us Kulcha :(,3
"Production team to cameraman: We will need a close up of SRKs face. Rock and roll that please, again, slowly...",7
For the sake of memes Kohli and Kartik should reach a consensus and let KKR get all out on 48,5
CSK should take notes on how to play for NRR from this match.,4
Want KKR to get all out by 48 runs now just for the memes,4
Cummins played 17 balls even coming to bat in 10th over and Morgan still on 24 balls.,2
Knight Riders should just concentrate on CPL,8
Are mods sleeping? There are 6 posts on the front pages about Siraj bowling two maidens.,9
Time to get Lord Siraj to finish this off,3
Lmao Gambhir said his target would have been to better 49 in this situation,5
No gave script to Morgan,3
Inb4 Cooldeep with 40(15),6
"Hey guys, how she going today? Is there an issue with the tv score graphics for anyone else, looks to be missing a digit for me.",5
Knight Riders 41/6 after 13 overs. A CPL 2020 score in an IPL 2020 match.,2
Chahal just had to perform well or else all the spotlight will be taken away from him in hi interview tonight lol,5
"Morgan won the toss and chose to bat

Virat said "" we would have batted as well"" lmao",38
"Pawan Negi ü§ù Ajinkya Rahane

Unless for the team except for being a specialist fielder",3
"8 runs, 4 wickets. Could still happen tbh bc RCB are into the tail here",3
Lazy sound guy using the same chant for Chahal and Chahar.,11
"C'mon Koach, bring Morris in. We want 48 all out!",9
"I don't want the cup.

Just bowl them out below 49 ü•∫.",19
KKR batsmen are making 4(18) and getting out. I'd rather they make 10(5) and get out.,7
What is Brendan McCullum writing? I've always wondered...,3
[removed],2
Kohli should bowl himself to check whether they are bowling well or KKR can‚Äôt bat.,18
so this enables KXIP to qualify?,5
Thank God r/cricket would have shifted the whole blame to dk if he is captain,16
"wtf dugout guys, scared the shit out of me",8
Come on Kul cha. Just take off your shirts and fight to death and decide a winner.,6
Find someone who loves you as much as swanny loves the Altroz,11
Morgan playing decently shows the pitch isn‚Äôt that bad,2
Where is SRK now? They would show him if KKR was playing good....,4
Record 4 maiden overs in this game,4
kuldeep comes to bat ...just bowl fast bowlers and end the game.,4
Tuned in here as soon as I got to know about the match just to see the thread have a meltdown.,3
That's what support of five teams combined does to a player like Siraj,7
KKR will consider it a victory if they cross 49.,7
49 all out redemption arc coming full circle,7
Latest BMac jot: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting canned‚Äù,6
At this point the Altroz is a meme in the Dugout.,11
Dugout bantz are something else üòÇüòÇüòÇ,3
This is gonna hurt kkr nrr,3
There should be points for assists in cricket like basketball,1
Scotty you call that flight chal chakka kha ke dikha.,1
Dugout goes mad on seeing Altroz.,3
"They're gonna forcefully take the Strategic Time Out, aren't they?",1
Look how the tables have turned,3
ALTROOZZZZ,4
8 to go,2
Cummins took the bait just like your average redditor.,7
LMAO I thought commentators had a heart attack while they were just fapping to Altrozz.,12
Lmaoo dugout taking the mick out of the Altroz. Marketing at it's finest.,8
Drinks in 9 balls momentum with RCB,8
Sanjar Bhangar is so cringe.,5
We might be the only team that makes it to the playoffs who has won the tournament before. I also have a feeling that we might see a new champion this season.,5
Baz the type of guy to write his exam till teacher snatches his paper & still fail.,12
God it felt like the dugout collectively orgasmed at the shot of that car,7
"get morris in, end them",4
"There was this one lad who thought all these teams losing paved the way for KKR getting top 4.

Bro, do you even watch the games?",3
"\*Wicket falls\*

Baz: \*Writes down\* FUCK",10
I'll believe ipls scripted if lockie pulls out some shit he did with us,9
"Ye 7 run tum se koi nahi cheen sakta 

T:These 7 runs ,no one can steal from you",2
kkr: remaining hands on deck. The new target is 49.,3
I‚Äôm surprised Tata hasn‚Äôt said anything to the dugout about sarcastically promoting Altroz lol.,2
Please Kuldeep show your batting skills in International arena not now!,5
Every single hurts,7
Gautam Gemphir died for this side,5
Inching closer to 49 noooo,10
I swear I'll make sure noone close to me ever buys the altroz car.,9

Costly over  /s,9
Can KKR get past 49?,6
Siraj warming up,3
I‚Äôve never seen Nitish Rana do anything useful,5
Dugout collectively jacking off to Altroz is hilarious,13
"Bring everyone else inside the inner ring to defend 49, you cowards",7
Ffs keep close in fielders for Kuldeep,1
KKR's next match is against DC hahahah üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,4
Lmao banger has been practicing.,2
Down voters logic: number of  down votes = number of runs scored by kkr. Sorry thats not how it works,3
Come on Koach bring in the 4th innings last wicket field set-up,3
[deleted],9
I don‚Äôt want to seem presumptuous or anything but I get the feeling this isn‚Äôt quite going according to plan for KKR....,7
I'd give the next over to Siraj hoping that he gets 5-for,3
The fact that kuldeep is playing cover drives lol,3
Swann and Bangar having an Altroz contest is more entertaining than the batting in this match,6
Sundar giving it away,7
"If Gambhir was the captain, he'd be flexing with 2 slips, a silly point and fwd short leg. Lol",24
If RCB manages to lose this im gonna move to non-cricketing nation and change my identity.,28
Kuldeep Yadav denying RCB,9
DK relinquished his captaincy for this nightmare.,8
3 runs 4 wickets,3
I thought CSK's batting the worst in the tournament. But thank you KKR for giving me some joy for a day.,6
Kkr ko aaj dream 11 pe team hi bana leni chahiye thi. Yeh kisi aur ko karne dete..,6
What's your pick: Godi Media or the Dugout Commentators praising the Altos car?,1
only downside of this game is that kohli will definitely bowl siraj in the death overs in some game,14
If Satyajit Ray were an MCU director - Black Pather Panchali,-5
"Can we null and void this match, please?",7
"If KKR loses another match after this one , I'd recon their playoff chances are toast considering the NRR",8
Kuldeep can audition for the Australian tour with his batting,6
Imagine if Siraj is the one making KKR score above 49 lol. This chat would get locked,9
RCB run rate  transforms  from nerd to chad  today.,10
4 more to go...,2
Kuldeep already batting better than Cummins,8
Bring back Siraj to end this tuk tuk,12
Baz writing fuck this shit on paper every passing moment,16
"Gambhir right now is probably already thinking of a cryptic tweet that would take a dig on KKR,DK,RCB, Dhoni, Kohli and Kejriwal.",20
5 runs in the over Sundar very expensive /s,8
If finch vaping in the last game didn't give you these vibes idk what will,7
Sundar leaking runs!! /s,6
Imagine them madlads who bet heavily on KKR batsmen on Dream11,6
"RCB just giving singles away. Come on, it's like you don't even want to dismiss them for 49",11
110 seems like a good score here TBH,6
[deleted],3
It physically hurts seeing Cummins like this,1
man is leaking runs,1
"Anyone knows the name of that chick in the RCB dugout?


Nvm got it. It was Dale Steyn",25
run rate of 3.28 after 14 overs,4
BIG BRAIN DK HE KNEW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.,9
The money has put too much pressure on Cummins. Franchises should learn not to overpay their players for a number of reasons.,10
"While everybody wants KKR to score only 49,I'm a simple man and will settle for the scorecard reading 69 after 20 overs",15
It took 10 seconds for my father to point out that Morrison is faking his excitement. Should I tell him?,6

"I thought Narine has been cleared for his bowling, why ain't he playing in the team today ?",1
"Yup, they're chasing 49 bois",10
49 worryingly close to being surpassed,16
Any chance of rain in Dubai,14
"Kuldeep ""Rishabh Pant"" Yadav about to wreck Siraj's last over.",7
"I bet someone is showing the highlights of 49/10 match befor the KKR match to Virat this season.


It's the only explanation why things are this way.",7
Is the pitch that tough or did KKR bat that badly?,5
[deleted],6
"Vintage Reds , idk if I'm jinxing tho",5
"Baz writing that if Fleming is sacked by csk, then wether he should send his cv there or not.",10

Siraj went from Lord Siraj to Siraj anna.,12
"That settles it, Delhi will be 3rd on the table because of NRR, basically a repeat of last year but with RCB instead of CSK",11
KKR is just practising for its next match which is against DC,14
Mere Kulcha ayengee,12
Gimme a short leg here please,3
Dhoni jacking off to this match,8
Can KKR get to a 100 atleast? Almost impossible from here with only Morgan hanging around.,7
"This looks like a bowlers paradise.

I'm still not sure of rcb winning. They can also choose to lower the threshold of lowest score today",10
chahal setting up players every damn game,5
Without Morgan‚Äôs thala innings this scoreboard would read 25-6 after 9. Jesus what a shitshow for everybody involved,5
What if Baz was playing FLAMES in his book the whole time?,0
"*Mccallum writing*  ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy""",5
"Gambhir getting pissed when they compare KKR with RCB and saying there is no rivalry between low level team . Now saying if he was the captain I would have looked to score 49 first.

Perfectly prove these teams are rival.",7
"A few fast, straight ones from Saini should suffice. They miss, he hits.",2
Chance of precipitation in Abu Dhabi is <1%. Knowing RCB‚Äôs luck this match is gonna get washed out anytime now.,7
rattle his stumps bro,2
Gautti bhaiya come outside,5
[deleted],6
We did it for Captain Morgan memes - DK probably,9
Weird that chahal has NEVER been in the contention for the test team. Gets the ball to dip and turn and is very good in terms of smarts. Anybody else have an opinion on this?,4
Hoping rcb wins in 10 overs,5
"Devdutt Padikkal's reflection is a great rapper.  
  
Cuz he's P DD",9
"I fucking love this sub, crying laughing at the comments here",17
Kuldeep to score his maiden IPL 50 today,12
Match will be decided by singles and doubles. Virat kohli warms up to score the whole target himself without hitting a boundary and running at 100mph,9
"Gill is important for KKR's success everytime, period. He is the anchor of the team. Everytime he gets out early, KKR's batting collapses. Can KKR fans stop abusing him now?",5
"RCB has a decent Indian core if not good with Virat, Paddikal, Chahal, Sundar, Saini, Siraj, Umesh, Dube, Parthiv. This is why teams like MI and CSK have been successful.",7
Can someone tell me why DD let go off all their good players even  after finishing first in the table in 2012? What‚Äôs the rationale behind this decision?,4
Go for the stumps he's a tailender bro,5
Lol saini with the economy of 8.,1
Difference between Chahal and other spinners is he bowls wide when he wants a wicket.,4
Look at that leave. Kuldeep is a natural test opener.,6
NRR Overhaul day boys!!,1
Koach an8matedü•∫üò≥üòÄ,3
RCB bottled it should have bundled these amateurs for under 40,7
Cross the fucking 49. That'll be win for KKR at this point.,5
I want KKR's NRR to be in the shitter,-3
They might go ahead of dehli I reckon of the NRR they gonna get ahead,2
Kxip is coming.....,1
I suddenly have a huge urge to watch test matches. Oh boy.,7
KKR's run rate is gonna plummet so bad that they might not qualify even if they win all their remaining games.,1
Animated Kohli montage is love,3

"Never watched a test match before, this is nice",4
"we need a bigger stadium here in bangalore, there‚Äôs no setting batsmen up at chinnaswamy as even mishits go for six",4
Will Chahal X Morris rival Virat X AB?,5
1 run to go,5
So sad I missed out on the sub until now due to work. GG Lord Siraj,4

Atrocitious by Saini smh,2
What will this do for RcB's NRR?,1
And to think Baz of all people coaches this side lmao,8
"I know we are doing one for all you fellas at the bottom half of the table , don't forget this ever",13
This score is lower than some powerplay scores we‚Äôve seen,9

"Dreams crashed. But hey, we still have 69 all out to look forward to",10
RCB played worse than this to get all out for 49,8
This is what you get for replacing dk as captain,5
"RCB can't even bowl KKR out for 49 or less

Losers",7
Moral victory for KKR as they crosses 49,4
Was busy so checking in now and.............WEW LAD. What in heaven's name happened?,3

"HAHAHAHAHA FUCK OFF YOU CUNTS, NO RECORD TODAY. I'M GOING TO SLEEP",40
Crisis averted,4
"Morris be like : You know what, Finch's pads will make those two extra runs!",10
Pack up bois. We won,9
"Nooooo!!!!
We were' this ' close to achieving greatness!!",5
I have a sneaking suspicion that RCB is going to take this to the 17th over,8
DK is a prophet. dumped at the right time,13
KKR will be happy with the moral victory of crossing 49,5
[deleted],15
Lmao Kohli and ABD are the best power couple in sport,9
"Moral victory for KKR, passed the elusive 49 mark.


Such bad captaincy by Kohli by giving this over to Saini instead of Lord Siraj. Totally unacceptable /s",14
F for RCB,11
THE DREAM HAS DIMINISHED for r/cricket,12
RIP 49,4
"KKR gets over 49.

RCB : Mission failed. We'll get them next time.",12
kkr scored more than 49. Lolhli shit captain confirmed,7
Aren't smartwatches banned from cricket field? Or are there some other rules for IPL/Kohli?,3
DENIED,3
RCB hopes and dreams üíî,2
Lmao just tuned in. What the Fuck is happening? Revenge for 49?,8
Bach gaya record,6
49 :(,5
KKR should just start hitting now. they should think they are 130/6,3
This was probably the best chance for kohli and rcb to rub off that 49 all out record off them,4
"Cummins didnt bat(ed) well, is there a chance of him to become a Siraj?",1
"Guys and gals, I have to admit something. Today was not my proudest fap I admitüòÖüòÖüëçüèΩ",8
Why do I feel like Siraj is gonna ruin his figures in his fourth over,4
Yayyy....curse of 49 lifted.... Dunno if I should be celebrating that though,2
Score achieved . Now declare,5
TBH KKR doesn't deserve to be in top 4 with the way they have played this season.,6
"I wonder if saini doesn't wear shorts  , loves two loose balls per over",12
"If KKR wins today, they should build Morgan‚Äôs statue outside Eden Gardens",7
"KKR on fire, almost half their score are from Boundaries.",11
49 crossed. My dreams crushed,6
KKR almost destroying Gambhir's legacy,13
Saini has conceded nearly half the runs. 23 out of 52.,8
"Tbh Morgan has done as well as he could, which isn't very well",10
49 crossed moral victory,8
RCB Bois stop being greedy we will have our revenge one day for sure!,9
"yeah, never quite liked Morgan other than in rdr2",5
KKR now playing to cross all those lowest scores in the bottom 10..dont think they will go too far.,3
Morris looks like he runs in slow motion,3
"If every team made their worst performers drive to the ground in an Altroz, we'd see more performances like Siraj's.",5
How low quality must bbl and t20 blast be if Banton is good there,10
where is siraj ?,3
RCB bowlers should be disappointed if kkr finish 20overs,7
Eoin Morgan and his Lusty Blows^TM,6
At least everybody stops whining about the batting order now..,5
"My dreams have been crushed. 
Bangalore would have partied if kkr we're all out for 49.",30
RCB's record of highest and lowest score in IPL remains intact.,42
"Go on Kohli, give yourself a bowl",3
Why isn't Parthiv Patel playing in any team this year?,2
will they make atleast 100 from here?,6
"Banton was an excellent addition, the only dude to have a sr>100",9
And people thought 69 was the magical figure...,6
"Now that KKR have crossed 49, Morgan gonna go berserk.",6
How the fuck is Rohit's hair good in ads. He almost lost it all didn't he ?,11
"15 overs done , I don't even feel it",10
Saini stop bowling short to Morgan,4
52 runs is typically when we get the first strategic time out. Hmm.,6
"Fuck this 

Wanted to see KKR tumbled to 48 all out so badly 

Anyways after this humiliating innings KKR should abandon any hopes for playoffs",9
Thanks Irish thala for keeping the memes safe,12
r/Cricket will be really triggered when KKR will retain their number 4 spot in the table even after this match! LOL.,8
we want sirajya,6
And we thought csk was bad,8
My disappointment is immeasurable,9
Reunite kulcha,5
What's the lowest score in the IPL after batting the whole 20 overs?,5
Kohli bowl yourself coward.,14
Kuldeep is cockblocking RCB hard from an all out lmao,15
My fantasy team is fucked lol.,5
No point trying to reduce your defeat margin if the target can be chased in the powerplay. No guts no glory.,6
[deleted],-12
Russell could‚Äôve done something here,8
"Just joined , what happened lmao?",4
Now just pass 67,1
"I have to say Siraj is a very hit or miss player I feel 

He bowled very well in a match

Next match leaked 40 runs in 3 overs 

Now this lmao",7
Fuck Morgan is on song,7
Morgan channeling Dhawan with sweepshots,3
"I have been saying it since the start that we have a shit top-order and we won the close games only beacuse of our bowlers.

Idk where we go from here, but if we are out of the play-offs, I would want a team that never won the IPL to win this year.",10
Anything near 100 will be risky,27
Shit.,12
Aaaand the final nail in the coffin for KKR,19
"Get fucked kkr, get fucked.",16
"I took the shell off my racing snail hoping it would go faster...it didn't work, if anything it made it more sluggish",6

And that‚Äôs the game,6
Yes,6
MorGone,6
"Lol, Morgan saved their dignity.

As I was writing it, he got out. Still, he done well.",15
A wicket after such a long time,4
Not even gonna score 70 now. Dumb shot.,8
Thank you,7
Damn bro!!!,2
"how do players suddenly start hitting at the 15th over? like why couldnt you hit in the 14th?

edit: nvm he just gets out the very next ball",12
Is white cricket ball very dangerous?,1
Sundar is brave. Got Morgan out,7
F,3
Idk how the commentators can call Morgan the superstriker of the match with a straight face.,9
We missed 49. But 69 is still a possibility.,13
How is this the 16th over already??,5
Nice setup,1
I‚Äôm just mad there aren‚Äôt any shots of SRK today... wanna see that mf sulking,8
Morgan should have stuck to sweeping,7
The fuck KKR is shit even on paper.,11
"Talk about 49 all out and all other dismal batting performances, but MI crushing CSK to 54/9 and 58/8 (in the final) in the same season (2013) is going to be the most dominant performance for me",9
Good Knight KKR,7
All out for 69?,8
"The pitch has no demons, kkr batsmen lost the plot today",7
Let's go for 69 bois!,7
Morgone.,9

F,1
How the fuck did KKR win 5 games?,10
"Slowest team 50 in IPL coming in 15.

"Great innings from Morgan, saved KKR from 40 all out.",11
"Oh Eoin. I don‚Äôt know if that was dumb or not, he had to do something.",9
**Irish thala** is the best thing I've read today. What the heck lmao,36
Yass Bois!!!Bowl them out below 100,6
Ffs Morgan couldn't you have done that 10 runs earlier,8
Is it the surface or is it very good bowling by RCB or is KKR just shitting the bed?,1
"He had to go for it, I'd be fuming if I was Morgan with how shit the rest have played",1
"KXIP- we are garbage, KKR- ""Noobs""

CSK- we play the slowest, KKR- ""Noobs""",6
Ngl that Kohli boom boom ad is cool.,3
Bring back Jacques Kulles,5
Big Lockie will cunt KKR to 100,3
[deleted],4
This is so painful to watch even as a neutral.,9
16D chess by DK to step down from captaincy on a high.,15
Is it the pitch?,4
Morgan scored more than 50% of the score,8
"Just opened the tv, and wtf",9
Irish guy went Scottish guy came,8
"Just remembered, SRH's bench in 2016 was Morgan, Williamson and Boult lmao",10
don't know how long we have to wait to give up lowest score fame to other team.,3
Looks like it's 69.,3
WHAT KIND OF BLACK MAGIC IS THIS,5
">Morgan shown intent after 49

_Coincidence..? I guess not..!_",13
"**15.4** Washington Sundar to Morgan, OUT, and Morgan perishes. I think the lure is the short boundary, but Sundar doesn't give him the length to pepper it. Morgan goes deep into the crease to try to pull this short-of-a-length ball, and gets no power into it because it is not short enough. Caught at deep midwicket **57-7**

EJG Morgan c Gurkeerat Singh b Washington Sundar 30 (34b 3x4 1x6) SR: 88.23",5
92/8 is the lowest score for a team whilst not getting all out. Set by KXIP against CSK in 2009.,6
Dinesh Karthik thanking God he handed over the captaincy to Morgan,6
Let's open with chahal,3
I've been working all morning so I just got to the game.... What the fuck happened??,5
"RCB Bros, please finish this match asap, need kkr to tank nrr",7
Morgan is today's Dhawan LoL,2
"Slowest team 50 in IPL coming in 15.

Previously held by KXIP vs CSK in 2009 in 13.1 overs.

PS, CSK won that game defending around 116n",11
Feels bad for Morgan. He's captaining a shitty fucking team with no players playing with intent.,4
"They didn‚Äôt make 49, at least give us a 69 :(",6
KKR would have been all out for 40 if siraj had bowled his 4th over.,5
Sundar stop I only have one heart to give you <3,1
Lowest 1st innings score in ipl is 67 by daredevils,1
10.3 overs of dots,3

Gill's dismissal was a 10/10 big brain move,6
63 dots wtf,3
Batriarchy smashed,6
Lmao think taking Siraj and making him the captain in fantasy leagues. Lmao,5
Really hope KKR fans don't go the CSK way and threaten to rape their family members,14
Captain Morgan is down,3
"Lockie about to reveal he's not only a gun bowler, but also a gun batsman as well",7
The Lockie show begins,5
"Only way kkr has half a chance of winning this is by getting two slips, one leg slip, one fine fine leg and third man to stop edges to go to boundaries and ......pray",6
"The IPL is just like Game of Thrones. Rajasthan Royals were once kings. Displaced by the SuperKings in the south. On and on it went, to the Deccan, to the Maharastrians, Kolkata. Now new Challengers to the throne await.

Everyone is just a spoke in the wheel.",14
"This is gonna do wonders for Bangalore's net run rate, quite the opposite for kkr though lmao",8

DK saw this coming,5
Kxip fans are more happy than rcb fans today,14
Just joined. Did I miss anything?,4
"Ngl, KKR team management and planning was absolute crap this season.",7

Bring back Chris Lynn,7
Time for Kuldeep to prove his bowling all-rounder credentials,4
LMAO RCB should chase the target in the powerplay,11
Can they do a Tewatia/s,2
"RCB left out Moeen today, but instead of Kuldeep, they ensured that the 11 men they fielded made the entirety of KKR cry",6
">63 dots

Jadhav and Dhoni suddenly very erect",22

I don't like Mitchell Johnson.",9
"One person calls Inzamam 'Aaloo', almost gets beaten. So many people call Ferguson 'Lockie' and nothing happens to them. /s",9
I love how ABD screams catch for everything. Ofcourse he might be able to catch it. But it's not possible for mere humans.,14
"Tuned in just now.

Well, well how the turntable!",3
"Here's something more to rejoice for RCB fans.

If KKR scores 80 in 20 overs and RCB chases in 10 overs their NRR will jump to 0.347 from -0.096  which is going to be a massive jump. 

Only DC (0.774) and MI (1.201) will have better NRR than RCB then.",7
Need ferguson to take 6 wickets in the first over.,2
KKR: *crosses 49 run mark*,5
This is what happens when I set 2 star difficulty on cricket 07 instead of the normal difficulty 1 star,14
Ferguson OP,6
[deleted],2
Ahhh all the NRR to be gained is juicy,10
"Can Kohli tweet in the middle of the innings , "" we are winning this match"". Probably the only thing that can save us today.",3
I don't even feel anything :),7
Match will get so hilariously intersting If RCB struggles like this also lol,5
KKR giving a worthy tribute to DDLJ on its 25th anniversary by giving us a sad cringe fest,6

"Hey guys, just tuned in. Is it the pitch? Or KKR shitting the bed?",4
Now you know why Csk plays tuk tuk /s,10
Ferguson with a 3/6 spell today. MOTM,4
I blame this all on the decision to overpay Cummins and then Karthik's decision to resign captaincy. Also add that Russell has been crap recently since his wrist injury.,0
"Is this how you gonna do the slip fielding in Australia, Mr Kohli? tsk tsk tsk",9
Anyone watching tmkoc ?,2

Easily the best current cricketer moustache,1
4 overs 14 runs 1 wicket 1 maidan. Yeah that's pretty much Sundar right there.,6
"Cancel KKR already, if they don't 69/10.",7

Ferguson batting in flat pitch,6
Do you think kkr will pull a tewatia through bowling?,7
"If RCB doesnt get KKR all out, then RCB = FAIL.",8

Inb4 RCB 15/10 in 17.2 overs,8
I can't believe somebody is actually doing an RCB against RCB. 2020 really is wild.,7
Rcb going for the big brain play by letting them play all 20 overs for even more nrr,8
Probably is a 130-140 pitch. They read it wrong and didn't respect the conditions. Kohli and Paddikal will come in handy while batting,4
Rahul Dravid is just horrific in that advertisement lol,9
Today Finch will score 42*(26) and the whole post match thread will be ‚Äúthis is what you get when you back your batsmen!!!!‚Äù,22

The revenge of the 49 all out.,5
Lockie looking much better than every other KKR batsmen,6

I thought we were guaranteed top 2 with our NRR but now looks like RCB will get a massive boost to their NRR and it will become a three horse race,9
"Lol, Kohli with the ""killed them"" hands gesture",11
I love RCB‚Äôs bowling options. Siraj and Udana might go without bowling out,12

What‚Äôs the most economical 4 overs in IPL?,2
"Imagine conceding more runs than wickets taken, pathetic imo",14
McCullum is NOT a good coach at the highest level. He has turned the team into a laughing stock and isn't even bothered about it. Go back to CPL that is your level. And to think that Kallis was sacked for him.,5
Can Lockie get 6 wickets in the first over?,2
I want this to be like that 2002-03 India-NZ test where India collapsed for 99 and NZ were bowled out for 94 in response. Was epic.,6
Baz stopped writing his biography today.,6
Get a 5 fifer lord,4

"Siraj still giving thrice the runs he gives in his first three overs, in his death over.",9
Just tuned in! WTH Siraj. Just read he was bowling good test match lengths and was getting some movement. Always thought he is more suited for the longer format of the game. Good for him!,4
Kuldeep _Irfan_ Yadav,1
This game is a great opportunity for RCB to improve their NRR! KKR might want to delay RCB's progress to the target as much as possible.,5

This fucker is invincible,3
Wtf? They have tailenders in and the field is still spread out.,4
"Got Lucky. No way Ravi spotted that inside edge. Going by his reputation, I think he flips a coin every time there is an appeal.",9

I really want rcb to win today to increase punjabs chances but i feel like rcb will still try to show the world who the ultimate meme team is in the second innings,13
lowest score without getting all out.,8
So no all out?,5
after the 49 and 69 milestones have gone rcb had no reason to get them allout,11
Scenes if this match ends up in a super over,9
Aight but Ferguson may fuck RCB up if this pitch is the issue,6
Excellent finishing by Ferguson,3
Is this the highest partnership of the inning?,5
"Got over 49/10.

Didn't get bowled out. 

That's more than a moral victory if you ask me TBH. 

*cries in a corner.",29
This sucks,2
All out is off the menu boys.,12
chad ferguson with  that 100+ SR,12
Looks like DK gazed into a crystal ball before he gave up the captaincy.,12
Atleast they'll not get all out,3
My boy Kuldeep is a star,3
If it was csk we would have seen few dot balls now,4
Ferguson is playing Russell's role now?,4
92 not passed.,5
Looks like KKR might reach 100. Good work.,-1
IPL 2020 and big last over,6
Didn't get all out. Moral Victory‚Ñ¢,9
I am getting flashbacks from KKR scoring 130 something and RCB creating history with 49 all out,16
"From 3 for fuck all KKR will be happy to take 83 and at least attempt a defence here. Not a bad score all things considered.

But yeah the field should've been in for the last 3 overs. A lot of in shots in the air that landed safe.",5
Am I the only nervous RCB fan,42
Remember RCB beating KXIP by 10 wickets chasing 94 in 2018. That's what's gonna happen tonight,6
McCullum writes into his notebook: reverse the batting order next game?,22
I don't know about you guys but I think KKR might be a few runs short this match.,12
The fact that these bowlers are facing 140 kph bowling and batting with proper techniques and trying to hit just shows their level of competition. There‚Äôs full time batsmen in my grade who shit themselves against 120 kph and lose all their techniques. Props to these guys for practicing for scenarios like this.,28
WOW BRUH,2
saini you fucking donkey \s,5
"Lockie, patt & krishna ain't bad but they don't have any runs to play with",2
Yo what the fuck? I just tuned in and RCB courtesy of Lord Siraj is doing *this*?!?,12
Everyone in KKR batting line-up should be shown the recording of Kuldeep and Ferguson batting atleast 5 times...back to back.,11
Whats the lowest score by a team despite not getting all out?,7
Leaking runs in the death smh /s,4
Best 3rd umpire this season,12
On the bright side even if we get 49 all out we won't lose by 82 runs this time,9
So Lockie Ferguson is the OG batsman for KKR today: 20(16) 125.00 Strike Rate,7
Kuldeep Yadav will start calling himself bowling all rounder once again.,8
How many Lockie Fergusons can you buy for 1 Cummins?,5
"If kkr wins this, I will shave my balld",3
This 3rd umpire is so efficient. No stupid rock-and-rolls,15
KKR sure does have a long Top order.,7
"What a class third umpire. No moaning, no shouting slower and no rock and roll.",22
What a trash last over. /s,3
Field shouldn't have been spread,4
"The day they play on a pitch with help for pacers, they bench Mavi and Nagarkoti.",14
MS to buy free air tickets for the whole team from Spirit Airlines,5
A dive was needed. Kuldeep is lazy TBH,2
I really like this third umpire man straight to the point,16
Umpires in this match are either blind or completely high on weed,5
KKR hold out for a draw on day 5 thanks to a gutsy rearguard partnership between Kuldeep and Ferguson,7
This game has more reviews than CSK's points tally,14
Got 30 runs too much imo,6
Chad 125/5 vs Virgin 84/8,8
Meh 84-8. 88-8 would have looked better.,9
Just give them the run man.,1
is this the lowest total without getting allout?,8
Banton still best sr. 125,2
Is this the lowest ever _not-all out_ IPL score?,8
Why does RCB players' body language look like it is 183 not 83?,4
At least KKR wasn't all out. I reckon RCB will chase this down within 10 overs.,3
"Umpire didn't even watch the attempted run out, he was ready to refer to 3rd umpire before the stumps were hit.",8
legend has it mccullum burned his ~~tom riddle diary~~ personal diary after todays performance.,7
Is this the '84 that George Orwell talked about?,14
LOCKIE !! GET EM BOI,3
">We were 60 runs short

-Morgan",16
RCB will either cruise through this or shit the bed. No in between,12
Sadly this is RCB so might not be that easy,4
Kkr realise that nrr depends upon ur run rate and not the no of overs u play or no of wickets lost?? A rr of 4 is laughable,8

Good for Harsha. One of my continuing grouses is why the hell do they insist on interviewing players in English if they would be more comfortable with Hindi.,9

How does the team coached by one of the best openers of all time end up having the worst openers possible.,8
There‚Äôs under-attacking like CSK and then there‚Äôs over-attacking when batting like KKR today. Finding the median is so important and quite difficult in international cricket.,7

3 beautiful outswingers all on a good length. The Rana one came in to the leftie but basically he had the outswing going to the right handed guys on a string. 

Perfect test match length and line. It was really impressive stuff. The only top order wickets KKR threw was that of Gill when Saini was bowling. 

You gotta credit the skill of the bowlers.",17
"Theoretically, in how many overs should RCB finish this match to reach the top of the table?",8
Plz Cummins and Ferguson open the bowling,3

Need to win in 10 overs else we are doomed!,5
[deleted],3
"This is most ridiculous. I am disappointed with Gill. What a waste. Instead of making a strong push to Indian team, he is having a horror season. I wonder lack of cricket this year is hitting some of these batsmen. Rana is another one who has barely performed this year. In fact not 1 batsman has been consistent. 

I am worried this performance will make kohli push for Siraj to be included for Aussie tour. That would not be good. But as for this IPL RCB is getting all its acts together. Chahal/Sundar have been phenomenal, in Morris they have a great all rounders and Saini has already proved to be among the most consistent fast bowlers and now we see Siraj performing as well. I guess we will next see Dube hit an IPL century :-)

&#x200B;

Cant wait for their match with KXIP. its going to be a story of unstoppable force(Lord Siraj) meets an immovable object(Universal Boss) :-)",7
"So, Super Over anybody?",10
RCB will make this interesting. full faith in them,2
Let's hope that Finch smoked W E E D before batting today.,8

Siraj has taken more wickets in this single innings than Pat Cummins has so far (excluding this game in case of Cummins) in this year's IPL,5
Thank god rcb won't be challenging MI's NRR.,2

"will there be a greater increase in NRR when chasing or when defending? 

In this case, If RCB chases it in 10 overs vs restricted them to 84?",4
RCB should have sent a pinch hitter to blow crap total away. Get that sweet NRR.,2

We‚Äôll be fine if DDP plays a 35(35) innings,13
You can‚Äôt even tell Finchy to bat slowly and responsibly like a test because like his batting in test matches he‚Äôll find a way to get bowled through the gate. You have to tell him to just cunt it around.,5

"From S Rajesh: ""RCB's net run rate is so far behind Delhi Capital's, that they can't go past them in this game. Even if they chase it down in four overs, their NRR will be 0.605.What they can do is improve their NRR so that they benefit in case things come to that later in the tournament. If they win in 8 overs, their NRR will be 0.422; in 10 overs it'll be 0.333; and in 12 overs their NRR will be 0.246. They may not go on top of the table now, but a big win here could come in very handy later""",7

"The scary thing about this RCB team is they're in a terrific position in the tourney without any consistent contributions from Finchy and Isuru -- two key overseas players. 

Once they get that bit right either with the players finding form or replacing one of them with Moeen, they can get even better.",11
Why are they Saving Ferguson?,4
If RCB chase it down in 10 overs what will be their NRR?,1
Dont worry guys they r saving these 4 overs of lockie so they can make him bowl 8 overs in the next game,5
Did Morgan just forget about Ferguson ?I see no reason to hold him back trash captaincy this,3
mORgAn sHoULd bE cApTAiN,8
Is this first coaching stint for McCullum?,6
"What is Lockie doing, why not bowl him? Is he weak with a new ball? Does he need the ball to be older for him to come good?",7
When your best bowler still isn't bowling then that raises questions what the fuck is wrong. This is why people believe IPL is scripted.,10
"why is fergs not bowling, KKR there wont be any desth overs",8
Shit fielding on top of shitty captiancy,5
[deleted],7
Will Siraj be on Chahal TV today?,4
"Honestly wtf is Morgan doing no Ferguson ,Banton 2nd down",6
Damn I should check out some highlights to see if Kohli actually hovers,5
"Lol,Gambhir is tearing into KKR management",12
"Why isn't DK bringing in Ferguson? Morgan should be captain

Oh wait. . . . . .",12
WHERE IS LOCKIE,1
Gambhir spittin faxx,3
Finch plays shit shots and looks frustrated,2
[deleted],3
Wannabe walking assassin Finch,2
Prolly Cummins last game this season .,5
Morgan saving his strats for upcoming matches,3
"Is Ferguson not a swing bowler? Swing has gotten wickets today, not yorkers, which Lockie is good at. Just asking",9
"Gambhir is talking nice things about Kohli, giving credit where it's due. Will r/cricket note this down, or just say gAMbHiR iS jEAlOuS oF kOhLi when Gambhir criticises him (where he deserves to be the criticised) a few days later",10
Why is Morgan wearing two caps? Is it to signify he's the second captain?,12
"srsly, that's how fast bowler are played? cm on finchy",3
What sort of high dimensional chess is Morgan playing by not bringing Lockie into the attack?,16
Gambhir is praising Kohli indirectly on air. 2020 strikes again.,35
Yeah don't start with your best bowler from last match.,9
"Finch should replace Warner as Australia's test opener in England. I mean, this is purely coming based off the fact that Finch's entire batting movements now are to negate swing",22
I mean it really does look like Morgan doesn't want to win this. DK gonna take back the captaincy mid match at this rate.,6
"Morgan helping England.... or the IPL version of England, which is Rajasthan Royals.",16
Looks like the match will be over before 10 pm,6
The knights are being ridden!,6
Imagine being paid ‚Çπ15.5 crores solely for your sex appeal..,30
Dont know if anybody's mentioned that yet but I think Ferguson should bowl!,9
Imagine being at this score after 11 overs. Yeah we saw that in the first innings,5
Can I relax now?,12
I swear it looks like KKR is just going through the motions.,3
"Can you believe Aaron Finch is an Australian World Cup captain. The legacy of Ponting x3, Michael Clarke... and then Finch lmao",8
"I saw Ashish Nehra saying, it might take 15 overs for RCB to cross the target! What makes him think that?",2
"How can you not open your bowling with Cummins and Lockie in this situation?

Morgan gets his brain scrambled when he plays IPL?",8
Lockie ko kya refrigerator mein rakha hai?,3
What shit music,2
Who was the last player with a double digit Cr price in auction to actually do well? Stokes?,4
"Bro, Morgan. With a score like that, every over is a death over. Maybe bring in Lockie",8
Every captain (other than Sharma ofc) is hell bent on making Kohli look like genius by comparison in IPL 2020.,10
Lockie????,6
Is this some Morgan captaincy that I'm too Kohli to understand?,12
inb4 they give it to Lockie and he makes it a shitty over cuz r/cricket curse,8
"RCB, end this misery. Please finish it within 10 overs",9
Morgan thinking if Ferguson doesn't bowl today he can bowl 8 overs in next match,8
I like how genuinely pissed Hardick looks in that Dream 11 ad,5
Wow. Now Varun. Talk about intent guys.,4
Does anyone know how to calculate these NRR stuff? Seems shady af,5
To win 48 off 90 lol,5
Wtf is Morgan doing?,5
Morgan keeping lockie fresh for super over,14
Missed the first innings. What the hell happened?,1
Did they actually bowl Chakravarthy before Ferguson wtf,7
You ppl can't imagine RCB fans' state of mind right now. They never had a privilege to see such a performance from this team from 2017,13
Good God DK wasn't this dumb.,7
Lol you have a bootie before Lockie - Thala Morgan.,4
Why tf are not giving the ball to Ferguson??????????,22
"200 IQ move by Baz and Eoin Morgan holding back their two best bowlers -- Varun C and Lockie so that opposition teams get less tape on them

Can't figure out bowlers if they don't bowl",11
Eoin Morgan brain fade,6
"r/cricket is such a fickle place. Now I see comments like ‚Äúsack Baz, Morgan shit captain, kkr so shit‚Äù. Relax guys it‚Äôs just a game. No one goes out there thinking ‚Äúlet‚Äôs lose this for the team‚Äù. KKR are having a horrid night but such overreaction is uncalled for. For any team.",20
Why isn't Lockie bowling? I honestly don't understand this team..,8
When will World's Best All Format Bowler‚Ñ¢ realize that banging it in good length fast won't always work,4
"""Give me Siraj and 10 pieces of wood and I'll win you the World Cup"" - Sir Clive Lloyd",8

Thala smacking his lips after seeing KKR batsmen strike rate.,5
Where the fuck is Ferguson,3
"That‚Äôs it Morgs, let them think they‚Äôre cruising to victory and then BAM, Lockie when you least expect it...with 3 to win...",3
Perfect plan by KKR to save Lockie for death overs 9-10 when RCB is on 79/0.,7
Thala Finch taking it deep,3
Virtual sex pest box,1
"RCB making it look easi, I wonder if they'll be able to pick up their NRR by so much that they're going to be too of the table.

Makes the race for the 4 th place so exciting. What a strange season for KKR, they have points on the board but the performances just haven't been there.",3
Sad to see Cummo do so badly tbh,5
Finch looks like he is a *khaate-peete ghar ka ladka*. Good marriage prospects for himüëç,6
is this the same captainn who won England world cup?,2
They want to bowl lockie after the game‚Äôs over,4
Morgan definitely doesn't want to win this. Did he forget that Lockie is there or what?,12
RCB with that above par 6rpo score rate,5
Can I watch dugout on hotstar?,4
Englishmen still asserting dominance over Kiwis by denying bowling opportunities,12
"0-14 in 3 powerplay overs is solid, commentators are being harsh. With such a low target, nobody is going to take risks, this loss is on their batsmen.",3
"So no demons in the pitch just KKR being shitty 

I love this",11
Why the heck is Lockie not bowling? Baffling.,2
We succeeded in holding on to 4th position with the shittiest team and coach for so long. Thats a win right there.,3
[deleted],3
"The fact that a team which has scored 84 in 20 overs is  NOT at the bottom of the table tells you everything about how much CSK have sucked this year.  
Amongst all the gloom and doom in KKR's batting, seeing 3 time champs wallow in the depths below our mediocrity has been like a soothing ointment",5
Kuldeep Yadav will not get his full 4 overs quota again :/,2
Meh this has turned into an absolutely shitshow for KKR. I think Morg has saved Lockie cuz he thinks this match gonna go deep.,4
Ferguson to kkr- bhai galti kardi kya batting karke..,5
"WOAH, we‚Äôre halfway there",11
"lol did this clown literally refuse to bowl Ferguson in the powerplay? Over guys like Chakravarthy, Cummins and Krishna?",1
""" we're looking at Gill as a future leader""


And I think that future is now lolll",1
"Good guy Morgan, not giving KKR fans false hope by bringing on Lockie Ferguson early.",6
"Great chance for RCB to boost their NRR. For KKR, this is such a bad news",2
"Morgan is showing 'chutiya' captaincy, by not bowling Lockie Ferguson.",5
Morgan is having brain farts,5
"Incoming rant/

I don't know why people don't believe some part of IPL is scripted when we literally have had team bans in the past. WHERE THE FUCK IS OUR BOI LOCKIE!!!!!",9
RCB NRR stonks ‚ÜóÔ∏è,9
I guess karma works in mysterious ways.,3
Your daily reminder: IPL's next season is 6 months away,12
"This being a Chase, i picked Virat as Captain for my Fantasy team. RIP to me.",9
Gold heap of shit,3
Chakravarthy? More like Chakraleaky.,6
Swanny is brutal lol,1
Why the fuck Varun C is bowling man? Where is Ferguson? Probably Morgan will give him when they need to defend like 5-10 runs. Honestly I don't understand this teams tactics!!,3
"I am used to see 88 off 46 and think that the chasing side can win this match comfortably. But, what I am supposed to comprehend 46 off 88? Pls Help",8
"""virtual guest box. fans enjoying the game from the comfort of their homes"" unlike everybody else",7
"Just to rub salt, they should send Chahal next.",8
Suffice to say Siraj has flunked from the Dinda Academy. The next bill gates or zucky,4
"RCB are going to chase this before Lockie even has the chance to bowl out, that is a damning indictment of Morgan's captaincy.",4
The only logical explanation of not using Lokie is to not overexpose him. KKR knows this game is gone so no point ij wasting Lockie,2
"Morgan Doesn't want CEO of East India company to lose confidence




These's no other logical explanation for not bowling him",8
"KKR finally chased RCBs score in the first match, only took them 40 overs and 18 wickets",6
"Finch, so useless.",2
This is usually when Finch gets out...,4
Morgan probably doesn't want other teams to study Lockie for the future games,5
Can some genius mathematician tell me what RCB‚Äôs NRR will be if they finish it off in 10 overs?,12
All sponsored shots coming thick and fast in expedited run chase,5
"Biased opinion: Padikkal should get a spot in the Indian team before Gill and Shaw

He's had an incredible domestic season and a brilliant debut IPL season too",13

Harsha has to stop midway in his commentary to acknowledge the virtual guest box. smh,5
Still no lockieüòÇüòÇüòÇ,3
"So I thought DK was a bad captain.

Sorry bro.",8
can finch bring himself to form?,1
"Who do you bowl?

15.5 Cr Cummins who is actually a batsman

Lockie who actually got 5 wickets last match.",11
This is just sad,3
Bangar has so much to learn about Altroz. Swann just recited the specs of the car lol,3
Lmao the Altroz,6
People who defend IPL against spot fixing allegations: what's your defence for the current World Cup holding skipper not bringing on his best bowler?,-2
Either Morgan is retarded or KKR management is trash,2
Bangar's altroz promo is so cringey.,4
Any chance of Paddikkal getting selected as backup opener for Australia tour?,6
The dugout is hyping up altroz sarcastically right?,7
Morgan's brilliant move to keep Lockie for the death overs /s,10
Ferguson hasn't bowled an over yet? Wtf,3
This is a snoozefest.......was really hoping for a tight match but alas,1
Devdutt should be ahead of Gill in the pecking order fight me,4
Man the Dugout has really taken to shilling to the Altroz. Wonder how much of it is ironic.,1
I think finchy is waiting for Ferguson's over to start firing,3
"At this point, why bowl Lockie and expose him to injury",5
They are defending 80 odd and their best bowler not bowled an over yet,3
Umm can they like bring out Lockie,1
Wow Kohli's such a loser being bowled by a 10 year old (boost ad),6
"""RCB's net run rate is so far behind Delhi Capital's, that they can't go past them in this game. Even if they chase it down in four overs, their NRR will be 0.605.What they can do is improve their NRR so that they benefit in case things come to that later in the tournament. If they win in 8 overs, their NRR will be 0.422; in 10 overs it'll be 0.333; and in 12 overs their NRR will be 0.246. They may not go on top of the table now, but a big win here could come in very handy later""

Banger is so cringe trying to advertise altrozzzz. They should let him stick to cricket and stop the joke.,3
"If it was kxip instead of rcb , this would have been far from over.",4
Finally Ferguson,1
"Just tuned in after innings break

The hell Lockie not bowled a ball yet and RCB are half way through the chase?!",3
Sorry Lord DK I asked you to be replaced with Eoin - I won't bowl Lockie- Morgan.,5
Here he is,1
[deleted],9
How many overs do y'all reckon RCB will finish this in?,3
Lockie‚Äôs economy rate is actually high,3
Dugna lagaan dega,2
Locke is being saved until the end. Morgan will take it deep. He's pulling a Dhoni.,8
"10 matches 




3 wickets







15.5 crs",8
Finally!!,1
Let's give Lockie half the target to defend!,7
Fucking RCB colluding with RCB 2.0,6
Where is Ferguson?,3
What I like about Gambhir is that he is always firm about his statements I know it's strange when he is praising Kohli's Captaincy but that's a fact when RCB was performing badly everyone was criticizing Kohli and now no one is saying that ok he is good captain too!,10
The biggest problem with kkr is that they are way too afraid to drop cummins cuz of the 15 crores they paid for him,9
LOL 7th over for Lockie.,7
To you get better NRR for wickets in hand or overs to spare,3
"If you are a real cricket fan, dont buy that ugly altroz car.",3
Devdutt anna should get out before 30 to end the rcb wins only when he scores more than 30 jinx,3
Lockie is probably not the best for swing bowling? Prasidh and Cummins' bowling is more conducive to the pitch. Saini was the only one who got hit among the RCB bowlers and Siraj was successful with swing,9
Okay now he comes to bowl. Would love to know what morgan was thinking,5
Why the hell is Ganguly all over the ads again? No conflict of interest?,3
"Surely now it's not a matter of if RCB win but when, I'm going with 14th over",8
How does pat Cummins have so many mvp points,10
Lagaan wasoolne waala is back bois.,9
Archer is really special,3
If only Ferguson had opened the bowling. Fuck you Morgan,1
Please finish before timeout,5
Who would've thought?,16
Ferguson strikes,10
"Is Locke of english origin?? He gotta be. Gives me some serious ""Firangi"" vibes!",10
r/cricket just jizzed,8
"I think Venky ""Chicken in Minutes"" Mysore has become complacent as the team principal of KKR cause his result areas are now neatly divided between TKR and KKR. So:-  
1) If both reach top 4 = he keeps his job  
2) If one becomes a champ and the other reaches top 4 = he gets small raise  
3) If both become champs = he gets huge raise  
4) If one becomes champ, the other crashes and burns = he keeps his job  
  
Given that TKR were the champs of the CPL this year, KKR living or dying doesnt really put his job in jeopardy",5
Now.imagine this happening 6 overs ago.,16
Man. Can we drop fucking useless cunt finch already. Please.,7
Ferguson took a wicket second ball. What a surprise.,11
Lolol,2
Lockie getting a wicket?Who would've imagined,8
Finch has been the most useless....,7
Finch really is useless,4
Dumbest decision to bowl Ferguson in the 7th over when the game is half done,7
Fifth consecutive match KKR have failed to take a wicket in the Powerplay ‚Äî Cricbuzz,7
Oh Finchy.,3
Kohli  vs freguson,3
ferguson makes immediate impact,3
Say his name Lachlan Hammond Ferguson.,8
whats the point now dumbass,5
And that's why we wanted him in early,3
Why has finch not been dropped yet ffs,5
Morgan you absolute Goose.,3
"Lockie takes wicket instantly. Fuck you Morgan, for not bowling him earlier.",12
"Fucking finally, imagine this in over 1, the pressure would be right back on RCB",7
Finch can finally vape in peace,20
[deleted],5
Haan locke toh chutiya hai usko wicket lena atta hii nahi- morgan probably,3
please drop finch already,5
*facepalm* why? Just why didn't you bowl Lockie upfront?,4
Oh shit..we still haven't crossed 49,8
Fergs gets wickets only in 7th over. Brilliant from Morgan,4
"Pls bring M Ali,  Finch is out of form.",4
Thank you lockie,2
Archer has been the most consistent player from the Royals.,1
Nice bowling by Jimmy Neesham,2
Finch should retire from IPL,2
How many of you knew ABD was going to be one of the best batsmen before he gained mainstream popularity?,3
Of course...,2
Finch wtf you doing?,1
Another great dugout prediction wth,2
I want to say fuck u Morgan for not opening with Ferguson but I wont.,1
The most probable reason here is that they wanted padikkal out before bringing on Lockie because of the left hander thing. This resulted in a AB-at-6 situation,2
Only if he bowled from first over,1
"If you guys have time, watch the Archer interview on the Jonathon Ross show. Dude is super chill.",1
Ferguson is super effective against Australians,3
Remove Finch!,3
Anyone have the gif of Finch vaping?,3
Why is finch still in the team?,3
"I genuinely think if a wicket falls, RCB should send Gurkeerat in next. 

Not much to gain for Kohli facing 15-20 deliveries and scoring 15 odd but it'll be useful for RCB for the rest of the IPL to get Gurkeerat facing a few balls and some form and confidence in the middle. He did well with AB but it's always nice to get a few more chances. 

Edit: And just as I'm typing this, a wicket falls",10
49 all out still on the cards,4
"At least we put up a fight a couple of days back. Not sure why KKR are sticking to their ""usual plan"". Play your best blowers as soon as possible, If it goes to the death, you are going to lose anyway.",4
How the heck is finch still starting games?,4
"NICE LOCKIEE !!! awesome   
Rcb please dont bottle, dont let fergs tewatia us",3
"Yes daddy, more please!",1
"At this point, maybe having Phillipe open instead of Finch isn't a bad idea. Or even got Moeen in down the order and move Virat up.",4
"And there you go.. Fergie takes a wicket.. maybe that's why he was saved for the 7th over.. Brilliant captaincy from Morgan.

/s",11
[deleted],7
I'm not ready for the memes that are gonna come from this match.,6
Lmao Lockie ended up having better strike rate than Finch.. Lockie - 19* (16); Finch - 16 (21),5
Time to drop Finch and get Moeen in,7
So fucking tired of finch.,5
Rcb should drop Finch. They cant take the risk in other matches.,7
"this is probably the lowest pressure innings finch will ever play. if he cant do well today, i dont think we can ever expect anything from him",8
Lol the DJ got it horribly wrong haha,2
Disappointing innings yet again,3
"I am shocked, *shocked* I tell you, that Lockie took a wicket.",8
Why the fuck was he not bowled before? Seriously Prasidh over Ferguson???,5
I'm convinced that Altraz's company has the commentators at gun point..,3
Finch played thala innings.  Time for koach to close the game,2
How can a World Cup winning captain be so dumb,2
Who were the competitors for kkr in 15.5 cr bid of Cummins?,2
they should send ab to finish this in 2 overs,1
"I wonder where Lockie goes next season, maybe KXIP or SRH?",3
"**6.3** Ferguson to Finch, OUT, and Ferguson produces the wicket immediately. These things always happen just to show up your captaincy even further. The extra pace from Ferguson, Finch stays back to a length ball, and it holds its line to take the edge **45-1**

AJ Finch c &dagger;Karthik b Ferguson 16 (22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 72.72",2
Gurkeerat getting to bat,3
Padikkal looks like hero Aadhi Pinisetty,3
"McCullum is really bad at making strategies , it's not just the captaincy,  coach has been poor for kkr",4
End of Finch..,1
"The issue for Aaron Finch this season has that he‚Äôs struggled against different bowling, in different ways. He‚Äôs been solid against pace (avg 40.3) but has scored slowly (6.1rpo), while against spin it‚Äôs been the opposite dynamic (scoring rate 8.4rpo, avg 14.0).",6
Gurkeerat! This is like Rahul sending Prabhsimran,1
"We have two players for our Lord XI:

1) Tewatia

2) Siraj",9
Finch fucking sucks,2
A kohli golden duck would make me forget KKR shite batting,7
We can finally watch gurkeerat bat without the pressure,8
ANNOUCING NEXT BATSMENT VIRAT KOHLI! - Mann - Sike!,7
Well what do ya know. Your best bowler takes a wicket right when he comes on. Too bad they decided to bowl him after the game was over.,2
Good decision sending gurrrrrkeeerattman. Kohli too scared of Ferguson.,3
As everyone is asking about the NRR of RCB if they finish it in 10 overs. I did the math and it will become +0.614.,4
Rest day for Virat and AB today,6
Zero pressure innings and finch goes 16 off 20. Drop his ass alreay,7
Imagine holding this guy back.,2
took 2 balls for Ferguson to take a wicket lmao,3
Bruh what?,1
Remove finch ! He‚Äôs so useless,3
RCB you jokers,2
Padikkal and Kohli to open with Moeen at 3? I can‚Äôt see why that wouldn‚Äôt be better than what RCB currently have,5
"yesterday on pre match show on cricbuzz presenters spoke about KKR for 30 min and 5 min for RCB.

Today also i expect the same.",9
"Why tf wudnt u open with Ferguson 

Kkr doesnt want to win",6
"Deep down in my mind, a fear lingers that they are gonna find a way to lose this match. And Lockie is definitely intimidating.",3
Coward koach lmao,-1
Too late imo,2
"Morgan is a wc winning captain because of an overthrow, clueless field selection and bowling order",2
"Ah man just end this already send Kohli if not ABD why him..


 I wanna sleep todayyyy",3

Swanny throwing some shade at Cummins lol.,2
Lol what is this. Send out the big guys. Don't you want some NRR?,2
coward kohli hiding from ferguson \\s,9
"Finch is a walking wicket rn, now that we are in a good position at the table, maybe try Parthiv or Philippe as an opener",3
Siraj will hit the winning runs. You heard it.,3
What a dogshit innings from Finch. He needs to go into not giving a fuck mode and just smash the fucking thing,3
Why was Ferguson brought so late,3
OMG TAT WAS SMOOOTH,1
LMAO,3
Lmao,3
Looks like Finch is going to play for Lucknow Lauda Lasoons when the IPL expands in 2022,9
"I don't mind Gurkeerat coming in, However if he gets out I want Abd",3
I hope we play philippe against SRH. Rest finch for that match,4
Wtf,3
WHAT THE FUCK BRO,5
Top fucking kek,5
Of course,5
Probable collapse?,3
Well well well,5
RCB SUDOKU,8
"Gurkeerat bruh, you had to sacrifice",8
Ummm,4
LMAO,7
I've said it countless times before and I'll probably keep saying it till this IPL ends.....it amazes me how Maxwell and Finch can be so dangerous in T20I but in IPL it looks like they are batting for the first time,12
Wtf gurkeerat just wtf,12
Now wait a minute...,6
The RCB we know and remember is back boys!,10

WTF just happened?!,1
RCB pulling an RCB,5
Good on RCB to say fuck NRR and give chance to Gurkeerat to get some Batting time.,5
that some selfish shit from gurkeerat,6
Gurkeerat u nonce. No one wants to see you bat over Padikkal,4
"LMAO He wanted to troll him so bad , he walked and hit the stumps",2
"Paddikal!! What are you doing dude?

He said No very early!",7
why do this to yourself RCB. Just why.,5
no match is over without rcb comedy!,3
Is he expected to sacrifice there ?,3
This is fucking why you should bowl your best bowler when you don't enough runs to defend Morgan.,6
they gathered around the stumps as if they‚Äôre blowing the candles of a birthday cake,5
Wtf are you doing,2
Just RCB things,2
greedy gurkeerat,3

"Man, rcb trying to fuck it up again. I bet ab won't get a bat. Stupid bullshit.",3
Not often you see the ol' run to the stumps with the ball rather than throw haha,1
RCB - you can‚Äôt be serious,2
That was on Padikkal. Gurkeerat was very loud in saying no,3
Well finally Cummins got a wicket !,5
Kohlaapse?,3
"Lockie Ferguson to Pat Cummins: Wickets main le leta hoon, aap 15 Cr jaake Dream11 pe spend karo",7
"Let me repeat, imagine this happening 6 overs ago, Mr. Morgan",7
It's even more frustrating.,3
Morgs you fucking melon why didn‚Äôt you bowl Lockie straight away,8
Imagine if 2 wickets fell in the first over,4
RCB has to meme even in such an easy match,11
"That‚Äôs why 
Every RCB fan has anxiety issues 
Even 85 is big for us",10
"Calm down people, Finch needs a partner to vape with. Dev is just being a bro.",11
And it starts all over again üòë why didn't you send virat,6
Rcb taking the kxip route,5
Totally unnecessary by RCB there,2
Mann better make some runs today,3
Padikkal confusing Gurkeerat with Kohli,9
Paddikal was playing so nicely.,6
49 incoming? :p,4
Paddikal need to bleed blue in t20 wc,5
Is it just me or are there absurdly more run outs this season,7
Gurkeerat be like. Sorry mate no more run outs for me.,12
I honestly thought he was going to congratulate him for middling the ball.,20
"I don't know why finch is getting so much hate, he did ok by playing out the new ball, running hard and getting through 3 Pat Cummins overs",7
6 wickets for Lockie in 30 balls this IPL. Impressive,8
Kohli walking in before Padilkkal left the crease,4
Will not be surprised if Tewatia had a talk with Siraj before the match.,7
Gurkeerat the  selfish cunt,4
No people there won‚Äôt be a Kolhapse no one can lose this match from here. Not even a combo of Iyer and Shaw.,9
I've gotta feeling abd's services are needed in this match!,3
that feels incredibly selfish from gurkeerat man,4
RCB NO! DONT GO BACK TO YOUR OLD WAYS,12
Man lenskart is shitting on Shadab Jakati every over. How is he dealing with that?,8
"Finally, another wicket for Pat Cummins.",1
Just one over from Ferguson and everything is back to good.,4
No game happens in peace for rcb fans. Atleast one circus moment in a one sided match,3
"Unpopular opinion, gurkeerat said no. It was padikkal who was stupid",17
"That was totally Gurkeerats fault, easy run",1
Sometimes I feel like I don't understand this game at all.,3
That was DDP‚Äôs fault,5
"That was padikkal's mistake there, it was gurkeerat's call",10
"time for RCB to prove they are the biggest chokers, not KXIP",8
"What on earth is wrong with Paddikal.

In the middle of the run, it was clear that his partner wasn't running, not sure why he started running faster and trying to ground his bath in the end where the other batsman was standing.

Psychotic running.",28
Wtf was paddikal thinking though,6
RCB and KXIP players just love to get runout,6
Padikkal maybe took inspiration from Poor-run.,13
Gurkeerat pic looks like  an anime character,8
Whos fault was it ?,6
Not even KXIP can lose from here,5
CEO of East India company ftw,4
That was on Paddikal,12
"RCB be like: Form is temporary, meme status is permanent.",11
RCB has all the ability to extend this run chase beyond 15 overs,4
Man I am still baffled with Ferguson brought into 6th over. Why not bring him early? What was the plan? I don't understand.,5
"lol enjoy dugout, hahaha",10
"Padikkal, bro. Gurkeerat barely moved. He called no clearly. This is on you",19
That was one of the loudest nos,4
Looks like DDP has graduated from the Pooran school of running between the wickets,9
WTF KKR only managed 84?,7
Run out in a low stakes game üëç,9
First day on dugout and loving Swann,9
"Gurkeerat 18 average, will never play for India vs young gun Padikkal 32 avg 20 years old, future India opener",4
RCB being kxip,4
How the fuck was that Gurkeerat‚Äôs fault? Someone care to explain?,14
"KKR deserve this and worse for sacking DK from captaincy, when the team was doing decently under him",0
Swann is by far my fav commentator,5
"Okay, consider me in the gang of people who believes IPL is scripted. You should have fucking given Lockie first over to bowl, Morgan!",6
"It's probably better for RCB that Gurkeerat survived, he needs time in the middle",2
Dugout is just r/Cricket shitposters irl lmao,11
why did DDP run lol,3
Great impressions in dugout,5
Why are people shitting on Gurukeerat? It was clearly Padikkals mistake,7
This is first 3 season performance throwback from kkr,3
Cunts here asking why didn‚Äôt Gurkeerat sacrifice his wicket. Fuck off ya cunts.,7
A classic yes yes yes yes No.,4
RCB VS KXIP final would be the best match for IPL,9
laughter riot watching the dugout lmfaooo,5
"They waited 6 overs? Seriously, Imagine the pressure on RCB if this was the 2nd/ 3rd over.",8
Lol dugout roasted rcb,5
Lol dugout commentators are jokes,2
Paddikal is the new young darling so can understand why people are hesitant to blame him,11
Lol brett lee and swann...,10
"Why are some of you insulting Gurkeerat? The match is already in RCB's bag, no need to take risky runs. It was Padikkal's fault.",12
"Padikkal is an idiot wtf, Gurkeerat called no but he just kept running - did anyone tell him how much they're chasing??",17
It seems like a selfish move from Paddikal to continue running when he saw the other batsman not running. Seems like he was trynna pressure the batsman to leave crease,16
"Virat will play it safely and smartly, but I'd love to see him smack some boundaries and end this early.",6
was Padikkal's call,1
Think that guy with the mic is RCB supporter,3
"We just need 38 you idiots, take it slow it doesnt matter",14
Gurkeerat Singh The Modified Jadhav,6
And I was thinking that we may win this one by 10 wickets lol,7
"""Never trust a batsman"" - Swann 2020",8
"IMO both Gurkeerat and Paddikal were stupid. Gurkeerat for not running and Paddikal for showing no awareness towards his partner. 

However, I‚Äôd put more blame on Gurkeerat.",6
No prizes for guessing the word Koach said to Gurkeerat when he met him on the pitch !,2
"It was 100% Ddps fault there, but r/cricket comparing whos the better batsman for some reason",13
This Virat Kohli looks like a promising young lad.,9
"Eoin big brain Morgan just saw his side blown away by fast bowlers and decides to bring his best fast bowler in 7th over. What was he saving him for, death overs?",2
Gurkeerat you twat. This ain't a test.,4
Harsha straight up savage LMAO: ‚ÄúThe only positive there for KKR fans is Pat Cummins picking up a few fantasy points‚Äù.,11
After 7 overs kkr had half the runs and double the wickets,5
"If kkr manage to win this, I will stop watching midget porn",4
"Nah, Gurkeerat did the right thing. Padikkal's fault, Padikkal pays.",10
Scenes if gurkirat runs them all out lmao,6
There was an easy run there,1
A great opportunity for RCB to do a RCB here.,6
Gurkeerat need to work on his grip. Dudes bottom hand dominates in all shots he plays,2
Gurkeerat was not at fault. Paddikal kept running like the end of the world.,12
The hell's going on? How was KKR only able to manage 84?,2
"Kohli marching in pissed off that again, things depend on him",6
Can rcb try to win this in next 4 overs for nrr,1
"Despite a poor start, Kohli is still in top 5.",11
Gurkeerat to run everyone out.,7
IPL Scriptwriters sending in Gurkeerat to subvert expectations,6
"People will look at Finch's score and think it's not too bad considering we're only chasing 85 but the fact of the matter is, he would've scored 15(20) even if we were chasing 200. At least Parthiv Patel gets a quick 30 before getting out. Finch really needs to be dropped.",7
Why wasn‚Äôt Ferguson bowled from the start?,7
What wrong did Dube anna do to get dropped for Mann?,13
Inb4 vk gets out,1
"Somebody explain this to me because I don't get it. 

You posted 84 on the board. You need wickets. You have Lockie, who took 5 wickets in one match. You have Pat and Prasidh, who didn't manage that between both of them in 9 matches.

You play Pat and Prasidh. 

Somebody please explain. My head hurts.",17
Anyone up for another run out with Mann n Virat run double Kohli,3
Inb4 rcb loses 8 continous wickets and end up 48 all out,10
"That's atrociously selfish from Gurkeerat, btw. It doesn't matter if Paddikal made the wrong call, you *have* to sacrifice your wicket when you have a set batsman at the other end. It doesn't matter even if you're getting your first hit out in the middle in the whole competition. Little thing like these matter. Mayank Agarwal yesterday sacrificed his wicket for Pooran, but Mr Mann thinks his wicket is more valuable than Paddikal.",-6
2 wickets in Fergi' over. It makes Morgan look even stupider,16
Kohli with the 50 strike rate. Smh,5
"Drop Finch for Philippe next match, let ABD get some rest",7
[RCB Fans whenever RCB pulls off some meme shit in a match.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTkjy4IsIoS1Rw5eSclLdLS1g8zHb12czS99A&usqp=CAU),9
I might be overreacting but Locke Ferguson is the best bowler of all time.,9
"Finch today: 16(21) 

Can Parthiv Patel be worse than that?",5
RCB that's why you'll never win an ipl respect your players imao it was paddy's fault gurkeerat shouldn't dispose his wicket,4
Tom Banton is actually a trained spy from the FBI,9
KKR should go all out with aggressive bowling. RCB are already halfway there and Virat is going to keep finding gaps and take 1s and 2s. Atleast try to win,16
"i was hoping for rcb to end the game by 12 overs to improve the run rate.

but alas",19
[deleted],7
RCB have done well this season with 12 points but they still have some opportunity to set this right and rediscover their old touch.,4
Kohli with that 25 SR. Drop him next game,13
Chakravarthy's eyes look like they've seen things. Things we wouldn't believe.,18
"Why would you not bowl Lockie right the way through from the start...come on Eoin, you're better than that.",3
Tom Banton watching from slip as if he's motherfkn Sherlock Holmes,5
[deleted],2
Should have sent lockie earlier,3
Haha! Shots fired by Gambhir on Dhoni in Hindi commentary....,12
Gurkeerat kinda sus,5
Now rcb will take 15 overs to chase this. What a snoosefest,3
ABD chilling there....hope he doesn't need to finish this match too,4
Finch really is a waste as an overseas player. Zampa/moeen/Philippe would be so much more useful.,7
Gurkeerat what the fuck.,1
"If Brendon were in RCB, every player would have been in their hotel rooms by now",3
"Morgan never even tried to win imo

1. Not bringing lockie before

2. Not taking a timeout after 6 overs after things looked out of hands

3. Fielders standing at the edge of infield to try and save boundary than take catches",4
"So, who are taking the decisions that are fucking up KKR‚Äôs campaign? Is it only McCullum? Or is Eoin Morgan involved too? Who would keep their gun blower from the previous match, till the match is half done? Why did Lockie Ferguson came to bowl only in the 7th over. Fucked up decisions.",3
[deleted],8
"I'll whisper it but its not like Morgan's captaincy has been leagues ahead of whatever DK was doing so far.  
In fact his decision to hold back Ferguson seems...dumb rn.  
I know Morgan won the WC but...that team was very OP. Proper favorites to win the cup too. I'm not dismissing his achievement but ...getting the best out of players who are a few notches short of absolute top class needs a different kind of nous",6
I love the lenskart ads,1
"Morgan should have started with Ferguson, no point in holding him back when you are defending 80 runs.",3
Aggressive test match close fielding required to make the match interesting,2
"40 needed from 85 balls.

RCB -> winning after 7 overs and 3 wickets with lot of struggle

KXIP -> Everyone ready for super over?",8
~~Jeez man RCB had a great chance to improve their NRR heavily but they just threw 2 wickets away.~~,3
""" why didnt Gurkeerat sacrifice his wicket""

..... Why would he? Wtf is wrong with u lot?",23
"Broke: Bowling Varun C and Lockie

Woke: Bowling Nitish Rana to get the wicket of Virat and ABD",9
Fuck you gurkeerat you twat. I want to watch ab.,2
"""out of form"" Kohli amongst the top 5 run scorers. The standards he has set for himself is unmatched",16
Only Punjab and RCB make this chase so interesting,8
Gurkeerat really testing my patience,2
"Haven't followed him at all, has Moenn opened?",2
"How Finch is such a beast in International T20s, he seems such a noob against pace in this IPL",4
27 overs in this match and it already feels like the 3rd day of a Test,4
Ok Bois. Rcb gonna take the match till 20 overs.,6
Okay RCB let's not make this game interesting now...,8
"If you think KXIP is bad, RCB is their dad üòé",1
Finch is a liability in the powerplay. Atleast pp can score 30 of 20,6
Did I just her ferg-use-son in the commentary?,3
Is Finch gonna be like RCB's Watson?,12
Not bowling Ferguson up front is reason enough for KKR to lose this.,7
"""be cool, be a bowler"" - a high white boi lost in some sort of studio",2
Good test session this,6
So when does Rana come on to roll his arm over and end up dismissing abd n VK back to back,3
"NRR will be +0.246 if we win in 12 overs.

Pls.",7
I hope they must have paid something to Jakati for that run out botch up. They literally telecast that ad after every over.,7
That's orgasmic.,5
Whatta shot. Played that on the up,8
"Wtf Gurki, I know there's no run pressure but finish the damn match.",3
They haven't crossed 49 yet....,1
Ah the sound of the bat. I came,5
Wtf is this? Net practice???,3
Is the Girl in RCB side a coach or what?,5
"RCB ü§ùKXIP 

Making easy chases unnecessarily stressful",10
"KKR Management : Okay Lockie, you are the captain now.",10
Love how the required run rate dropped by 0.3 after a single 4,15

Rcb crossed 49,10
Shot boy,8

"Gurkeerat bats a bit like Koach, doesn't he",14
"Jeez it was not gurkeerats fault. He called it sure, but so do many other batsmen and then he shouted no very clearly. Paddikal never paid any attention to gurkeerat. And no way should gurkeerat sacrifice his wicket for that, it was paddikal at the other end not abd",38

He barely performs in IPL",15
"To all those people saying gurkeerat was selfish to not sacrifice his wicket, this match isn't at stake. He got an opportunity to spend some time in the middle and play his shots and this opportunity came probably second time this season. He might want to prove his point. No batsman walks out wishing to sacrifice his wicket. Frankly, there was an initial movement, which every batsman has and he shouted no. Padikkal should've gone back. Stop this sacrificing mentatility",56

"So many idiots in the match thread sucking DDP's dick. 

1) Do you know how running works? If it's played in front of square, the batsman's eyes are following the ball direction and looking at fielder positions, it's his call. When the ball is played behind square, the batsman's eyes are not looking at where it goes in the initial instant when that decision is made, the runner is looking where it's going, where the fielders are. Whether the ball is played in front of, or behind square, determines whose call it is almost 95% of the way. That was gurkeerat's call for sure.

2) Why the fuck do you think they sent him at 3? They want him to have match time. Why would he sacrifice himself? I like DDP and want him to do well, but that was his fault 100%. Stop bitching because he's young/in form/etc.",40

shot boi,6
Yes! Now play like this!,7
Is it just me or does Gurkeerat bat like he doesn't know how to bat,-6
As a batsman I would simply stat pad my strikerate and smoke these bowlers out the park!,4
Padikkal ran like a cunt who rides his bike with his earphones on.,26
Gurkeerat is underrated tbh,10
So Koach taught him that extra cover lofted drive... Love it,16
"Completely daft captaincy from Morgan, at least try to make a match of it.",2

Gurkeerat to me feels like Pujara in disguise.,5
Are we sure that Gurkeerat Singh Mann and Mandeep Singh aren‚Äôt the same person? Have we ever seen them in the same room together?,12

I am legit hating how commentators are talking more about 'Kohli utilising Siraj' than how well Siraj bowled. The world doesn't revolve around Kohli!!!,21
MI VS RCB finals ...watch Kohli getting  LBW via Boult like WC Semis.,9
Should RCB pick Siraj now onwards and allow him to bowl power play upfront,9
Gurkeerat is such a selfish asshole! He should hit wicket and jeopardize his career because I want to watch AB bat! /s,29
Cricket is not easy for skinny people. One shot and your arms start paining,4
KKRians still hoping that RCB's gonna choke here... Get a life blokes,17
Can someone tell me when was the last time RCB had a positive NRR halfway after the tournament?,7
Gurkeerat looking so shit. Honestly dubey looks better.,-14
What happened to Zampya? Why aren‚Äôt RCB playing him?,3
Lmao considering the damage Siraj did today... Rabada and Nortje will skin this KKR lineup alive at this pitch,16
That would have been an easy gully catch in Test cricket,2
Good idea to send gurkeerat in this situation to play anchor. If wickets fall quickly he can anchor one end and try to rotate strike. Someone else can play finisher but anchoring is important especially for rcbs non existent middle order,9
"CSK, SRH at bottom, DC, RCB in top, MI in top in an even numbered year. The world is definitely upside down",15
If RCB is gonna be this damn disrespectful of Gurkeerat they can give him back to us and take their filthy Karun Nair off our hands.,2
Dube needs to come in. Mann out. Also Finch needs to be dropped,2
Kohli seems to be rotating strike to let Gurkeerat face more deliveries. Very considerate and sweet.,19
"The team that should be most disappointed is Rajasthan. They have probably the best 4 individual overseas players. Top shelf domestic talent (Sanju Samson). Seasoned veterans (Uthappa). And Lord Tewatia has shown miraculous performances. Yet only 4 wins.

Mann is a fine player. He just hasn't got many opportunities.,6

No sixes from RCB. Lol,3
ABD with the Bond villain beard.,9
"Many punjabi players groomed by Vikram Rathore have had a very traditional orthodox  style of batting, theres a reason why we dont produce any sloggers

Including Mandeep, Gurkeerat, Shubhman, Abhishek among others 

Gurkeerat is very notorious for not caring for how the pitch plays, even in Ranji Trophy and playing his shots. He has a strike rate of 81 with an average of 43. 

Anyone who watches Ranji knows Punjab choose to play on either the dust haven of Patiala or unlimited swing of Mohali to force a result. Makes the record of the likes look even better.",12
Okay i just woke up but what the fuck?,10
"Why is everything being downvoted?

Salty CSK fans cant bear RCB win?",26
Why is Kohli morphing into Anil Kapoor?,3
PLAYOFF BERTH CONFIRMED BOIIISSSS :D,18

Get spanked,7
"If they don't end this in next over and if they take it strategic time out in 13th, it's for sure that they did it deliberately",7
"Hope this is good for Gurkeerat's confidence, our middle order will look a little better with him and Morris.",20
This IPL is going the way I wished it would,7
Love it how kohli is happy for gurkeerat. He does that for all domestic players.,20

Why is gurkeerat laughing after every ball,13
Poor stuff by RCB. They should have finished this in the Power Play /s,7
Gurkeerat really shown his place there by Ferguson,1
"People criticize kohli but I like him

Gives DDP the chance to play at his ideal position

Finally bowls sundar this season

Sends in gurkeerat ahead of abd to get some practice of anchoring

Siraj. Holy hell has siraj finally repaid kohli in some way atleast after all this time of leaking runs

Saini has been a nice find

Hate him all you want but atleast kohli is giving youngsters a chance to shine and they have mostly been reliable to their captain and team",55

"Sorry yo DC fans but I'd love an RCB vs KXIP finale.

KKR bowling is a big fail. Ferguson and Cummins especially is the biggest fail. He had to take a 3-4 wicket haul today. Good teams can get the chasing team out for 60 odd in this case. But KKR is not a good team. They gave up.  I remember I was at a club gig last year and we were in a similar situation in quarters of that tournament but our bowling unit came through and defended 72. It can be done if you don't give up.,-36
As an MI fan I am really skeptical of their chances as RCB and DC  look far better teams and KXIP coming in strongly coupled with the fact that CSK has made it to the playoffs every time they have been a team in IPL (they were in the same situation in either 2014 or 2015 and made it to top four I just hope MI make it to top 4.,-11
The match was fine but even in highlights you can see how shitty the umpiring today was ffs,29
Shortest highlights of this IPL yet,32
"As an RCBian it is soo satisifying see RCB beat KKR twice in the same season, nw the same thing against CSK would be just great",37
