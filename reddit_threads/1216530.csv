As for the the game, if KKR don't bowl a spinner in the powerplay which they usually don't, this might finally be a decent match for Finchy. 

He's all at sea recently vs proper swing/seam bowlers who hoop it around corners -- The likes of Sandeep Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Boult, Shami etc

Now only reason I'm watching today's game is 'context'. When you're watching IPL, the excitement of the new season takes you through the first 2 and a half weeks. After that, every game assumes a certain significance because it impacts where your team stands on the table. So you get your calculators out and play out scenarios and root for a certain team every game. 

Now with a 9 or 10 team IPL, each game is less significant because you have more games. And that's why with football leagues because not much changes in 2 weeks of missed games, it's okay if you miss those games. Whereas you can end up in the top or bottom half with a single win/loss in the IPL. This qualifying scenario context becomes significant towards the end of the league in a larger league.

That's why I think IPL should stay an 8 team tournament.",5

Basically to paraphrase, he's saying that the management won't think of this as a must win since they can still lose a couple and qualify. 

Also, he'll be under tremendous pressure and scrutiny with respect to his action. If he bowls overs -- 7,9,11 and 13 where batsmen look to play him out and not take too many risks he can settle down quickly and not bowl that quicker ball that usually gets him in trouble action wise. 

However if they use him while defending a 160-170 score and he's bowling the death overs like he did in the two close matches KKR won, he may revert to type especially if someone like AB or Virat puts him under pressure and thus resulting in another warning which is an automatic ban.",4

I am worried this performance will make kohli push for Siraj to be included for Aussie tour. That would not be good. But as for this IPL RCB is getting all its acts together. Chahal/Sundar have been phenomenal, in Morris they have a great all rounders and Saini has already proved to be among the most consistent fast bowlers and now we see Siraj performing as well.

Even if they chase it down in four overs, their NRR will be 0.605.What they can do is improve their NRR so that they benefit in case things come to that later in the tournament. If they win in 8 overs, their NRR will be 0.422; in 10 overs it'll be 0.333; and in 12 overs their NRR will be 0.246. They may not go on top of the table now, but a big win here could come in very handy later""

1) Do you know how running works? If it's played in front of square, the batsman's eyes are following the ball direction and looking at fielder positions, it's his call. When the ball is played behind square, the batsman's eyes are not looking at where it goes in the initial instant when that decision is made, the runner is looking where it's going, where the fielders are. Whether the ball is played in front of, or behind square, determines whose call it is almost 95% of the way. That was gurkeerat's call for sure.

2) Why the fuck do you think they sent him at 3? They want him to have match time. Why would he sacrifice himself? I like DDP and want him to do well, but that was his fault 100%. Stop bitching because he's young/in form/etc.",39
