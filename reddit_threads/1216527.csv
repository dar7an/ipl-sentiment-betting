2020-10-18T13:12:38+00:00,Noligation,"Let's Talk Rahul


448 runs in 336 balls at a strike rate of 133. Looks great!!

Rahul sans his 132 in 69 or so..

316 runs in 267 balls at a strike rate of 118.3


That's not good enough,  specially as he tends to bat til the end without ramping up. That's not good for either an opener or a finisher. 


 Gill is similar with 311 runs in 273 balls, striking at 114. 


What do you guys think about KL rahul's batting this far?  Slow or balanced?",4

Bring it on. Things life makes you see ..

What people should realise that this negativity not only affects them the most but also makes this thread a worse place for cricket lovers and newcommers to be in..

Second is there is no out and out overseas batsman who could replace him. It is either Neesham or Cortrell/Mujeeb/Vijolen. I would say KXIP should trust him and Hooda to bowl 4 overs and bring in Mandeep Singh for one of the bowlers.",15

 - MI: lose 5/5 from here. Exposed badly in the spin department and miss playoffs. 

 - DC: win 7/7.

 - KXIP: semi finalists.

 - RCB: playoffs.

 - SRH/RR: playoffs.

 - KKR: don’t care. 

Will settle for one of KXIP, SRH, RCB winning the whole thing as compromise.

MI, CSK winning the whole thing is a disaster as always.

RR, KKR winning the whole thing evokes no emotions.",-38
