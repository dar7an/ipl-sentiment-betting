Gayle to hit a hundred today. And Rahul should demote himself.,4
"Who created this matchbot? Its pretty awesome, I wonder how it works",4
Rooting for Punjab. They can beat MI if they give it their best.,7
"Punjab should win, show mi they are not better than everyone.",7
"Rahul has a great record against Bumrah. Hoping for a KXIP win as a RCB fan. Cmon KXIP win for us, we banned De Villiers for you!",5
Lockie Feguson should have been in Punjab :(,6
"Nortje and Feguson 50 Lakhs haha, In comparison Cummins 1550 Lakhs",7
"Let's Talk Rahul


448 runs in 336 balls at a strike rate of 133. Looks great!!

Rahul sans his 132 in 69 or so..

316 runs in 267 balls at a strike rate of 118.3


That's not good enough,  specially as he tends to bat til the end without ramping up. That's not good for either an opener or a finisher. 


 Gill is similar with 311 runs in 273 balls, striking at 114. 


What do you guys think about KL rahul's batting this far?  Slow or balanced?",4
How you guys think our line up looks like today?,2
"Want us to chase, this KXIP batting lineup is full of matchwinners",2
Whens the toss,2
i want kxip to defeat mi for the memes,8
"**MI**

* Rohit (C)

* De Kock (W)

* Suryakumar

* Kishan

* Hardik

* Pollard

* Krunal

* Coulter-Nile

* R Chahar

* Boult

KXIP lost the toss so that means they are going  win the match,6
"**KXIP**

* Rahul (C/W)

* Agarwal

"Team retained

The only change i wouldve made was Mandeep back in but I'm told that he dislocated his thumb in a fielding practice session the day before RCB game unfortunately. No idea on how long it will take for him to get better.",2
We essentially only have 4 Batsmen today,2
"Ok. 2 days ago Rohit says teams batting 2nd will win more. Yesterday teams betting 2nd won both matches.

Now he wins the toss and chooses to bat first. EH?",1
"I hope KL learned his lesson from last game. He said ""last game got too close for comfort"".",1
"ESPNCricinfo: "" *Rohit Sharma has won the toss, and* ***Mumbai Indians will bat first*** *despite saying last game the trend is about to change. What a troll.""*

Lmao",3
"In 2014 KXIP were at the top of the table with 5 wins and no loss, MI at the bottom with no win and 5 losses. MI surprised everyone by beating KXIP

Now MI have 6 win and 2 losses (at the top of the table yesterday) and KXIP have 2 wins and 6 losses and are last placed. Can we expect something similar?",11
"Why are we not playing pattinson? He's a good top end bowler who just had one bad game. Bumrah, Boult and Pattinson made for a dangerous pace attack. I can't understand why they are tinkering with a winning combination.",3
Today's match should be live-streamed on r/bdsm,7
"Warner's power and strike rate has been on a decline since 2017. And this year, we are seeing the worst of it. I just want the old basher back.

Edit: Oops wrong sub.",1
Inb4 someone bowls short to Rohit again.,2
[deleted],7
"Wth not today, why I superover today?? Any other day would be fine",5
KXIP probably also makes Maxwell drive the bus back to hotel to get that ROI,2
Lol no one's here,6
Super over üôÑüôÑüôÑ,4
Rcb and Dc fans which game y'all watching,1
MI Powerplay or KKR v SRH superover. Confused me.,3
Can they put up the super over on the big screen in this match and take a pause?,3
How to watch this match,2
Where are they airing mi match?,2
"Why can't they delay this match? No one wants to watch this, we have a super over on the other side right now!",1
"Lmao, only 71 comments yet. Super over in Ist match.",2
"Super over on ss1 , mi v KX on hotstar.",2
Maxwell's scored his last IPL fifty on 6th May 2016. Let that sink in.,3
I can't find the channel! All Star sports channels are showing SRH vs KKR,3
Brisk start,2
Fucking hell the SRH vs KKR super over is hogging the telecast,7
Man am here cause am losing too many  braincells watching SRH VS KKR,8
"Ok, super over ended in other match. Come over here.",4
Shot Quinny!,3
De Kock reminding us what competent cricket looks like.,2

Godamn.....!!!! Arshdeep on fire...,3
Arshdeep can do no wrong,3
SRH pulled off a KXIP there in the other match lmao,45
Lockie should have bowled the wc superover,4
How does someone who bowls pure shite like Arshdeep get wickets?,-2
"**2.5** Arshdeep Singh to Sharma, OUT, timbahhh. Arshdeep gets Rohit Sharma. Looks like a legcutter to me, but it isn't. He has bowled seam-up and on-pace. Short of a length, not too much room, and Sharma looks to run this down. Too close to his body, and he plays on **23-1**

RG Sharma  b Arshdeep Singh 9 (8b 2x4 0x6) SR: 112.50",1
Fuckin A Rohit. The team is firing but he's been lacking last few matches.,1
Does Punjab still have a chance to qualify for playoffs?,3
"Rohit took that ""performing in even year"" ad too seriously

This year, In odd matches: 5 innings 40 runs

In even matches : 4 innings 220 runs",14
Super over at Abu Dhabi,3
Looked like it pitched outside,2
Good guy Lokie knocking over SRH quick to get to watch this match.,5
Might actually have a match on our hands.,2
I just changed channels for 1 ball and Sky gets out.,7

Ofc Mumbai is gonna choke against something like Punjab lol,9

SA Yadav c Ashwin b Mohammed Shami 0 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
"In rest of the matches, I want all the underdogs to win except Csk.",7
It's kxip. I think even a 100 and we'll see a last ball match,20
Boult lost the World Cup Final 2019. Dropped a catch and is useless at the death.,-5
Lmao MI about to fuck around and lose to KXIP for no reason .... /sigh,4
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
This may sound pompous but i'm not too worried about this start. This will give the middle order some match practice. I don't even remember when I last saw pollard bat,7
"Nice transition, wtf happened here",7
Memebai Indians getting their top even year game in today. Sweet guys.,5
Two wickets whoa,7
Good platform for middle order to step up again. Should be interesting.,4
Punjab gonna beat Mumbai just got the memes,5
Well done.... ¬Ø\_‡≤†_‡≤†_/¬Ø,3
Rashid Khan bowled well but it's nearly impossible to defend 2.,9
Nice overthrowüòÅüòÇ,3
Did KL say MC?,7
Typical MI scoring 200 + run from here.,3
They could have run one more,3
Commentators sound like the kids who don‚Äôt prepare for the presentation and just bullshit their way through it,2
Ben Stokes from KL,4
"Lol, Rahul just said madarchod",4
"Wtf Pooran lmao 

Shami gonna pissed",3
Lol. KL does not even want to say anything now.,3
Everyone will come crashing here from the other thread,4
"Oh no MI seems in trouble 
Hoping for another De Kock masterclass.",2
Lol KL with that Ben Stokes there,5
"Come on MI, don't lose against KXIP now.",6
Not the guy you want to do that to.,0
That wild hard throw... Pooran surely with some unresolved anger issues /s,2
KL is like that lost kid who has no idea of what going on in maths class.,2
De cock needs to go if kxip want to have a chance,3
Damn this match is well underway,1
Guys can punjab and chennai still qualify?,2
You guys missed the most boring super over of T20 history,81
"They are actually using maxi as sundar/axar bowler in pp, smart",3
what the f....,5
Come on Punjab please win,6
Where did the dugout feed go?,4
I don't get that how Maxwell gets away with such economy. Last match and this match it's happening again.,2
Ferguson cleaned SRH up with 5 wickets rofl,7
So maxwell is a bowling allrounder now?,5
[removed],6
Damn I missed two wickets because of the poor super over,5
"This is the difference between Hooda and someone like Mandeep

He gave up midway, couldve saved 2 there but gave up",3
I'm supporting Punjab so we're not the only team to lose to Punjab,23
Fuckin Maxwell bowled 2 overs in powerplay with 7 economy.,9
Want pollard to get a long bat there . Like a40 ball innings .,3
Someone link kl saying mc video,5
Krunal Pandya already looks high.,11
"Arshdeep getting Kishan this over

E: CALLED IT, ME AND ARSH BOTH GOT LUCKY HAHAHAH

Petetion to put me in dugout",16
Unpopular opinion - Rohit sharma is kind of liability for Mumbai. Very inconsistent. Good innings from him are few in last 3-4 years.,-15
Damn wtf MI. Gonna ruin this aren't we. Hahahahaha.,9
Brilliant move to get 2 cheap overs from Maxwell.,20
Lol... Even arshdeep can't believe he got this one.,17
Discount DeKock has shit the bed.,5
MI want weekend off.,3
Come on let's get De Kock,2
Lololol,3
Is this really MI?,3

Ishan Kishan is Risabh Pant with poorer judgement.,2
"Short, wide, and that should've been put away

MI returning the favor for 2014 when we won the first match against KXIP after losing 5 matches on a trot.,7
Shit Gets Wickets^TM,1
Looks like Mumbai is testing its middle order today for the playoffs,11
Lol today is a day of memes. MI forgot how to bat,8
Well well well,2
In another episode of public hyping up a player after a flashy knock.,9
Come on Softdik. Do something. You're a daddy now.,2
KXIP playing like MI and MI playing like RCB,2
This is what i expected DC to do but oh well KXIP doing it works as well!,1
38-3 in 5.1 and there's still enough batting to get to 180.,1
Punjab needed DeKock instead they got to live with just Kissing,2
Ishan kishan has disappointed me.,0
LMFAO Punjab is bullying Mumbai at this point,7
Let's goooo Punjabbb!,2
[deleted],6
Um is anyone getting the dugout feed? I cant.,2
Le lo everyone gets batting today. Let‚Äôs see how much they score,5
Arse gets a wicket lesgoooo,1
"Gotta get deKock though, he‚Äôs got that big dick energy",4

What is happening !!??,1
MI has had so much luck this tournament so far.,0
"Can Maxwell do an Afridi to his career?
Give me your takes",2
Imagine MI losing this and RCB being 2nd. üòÇ,7
"**5.1** Arshdeep Singh to Ishan Kishan, OUT, one more wicket for Arsh. Short, wide, Kishan tries to cut this square, but the extra bounce from his height means it gets a little big on him, and he fails to control it. The top edge settles with deep third man **38-3**

Ishan Kishan c Ashwin b Arshdeep Singh 7 (7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",2

MI today: Kiss on the cock.,4
"Rahul seems not happy with these quick wickets, I mean, you gotta give him enough runs to retain his orange cap.",7
KXIP winning here will make things very interesting,4
yeah this is good actually i was having too good of a day and  needed to be humbled,8
"My shit stream is still showing the srh v kkr game

Edit: YuppTV stream, it's for EU viewers. They finally switched to this game now.",5
Ishaan kishan is sanju samson lite,8
Wtf why keep sending left handers,5
"Yo just tuned in and WTF they lost two wickets already?! My friend texted me, ""they lost two wickets already!"" and I thought KXIP was batting.",5
Is this an Alternate Universe?,4

Except 99 against RCB his performance has been shit",0

"                         MI ü§ù RCB

The problem playing with teams who know they wont qualify is they dont have anything more to lose. They are gonna f you up.,4
"Why not Pollard smh, no excuse of left-right combo too",-2
[deleted],-3
I see MI is trying out the Left-Left combo,3
"I have no doubt MI will score 175+ even from here. They are too OP, someone or the other is going to standup.",8
I am just waiting for the imminent Pollard masterclass. Fucker always turns up against us,2
Is the pitch slow or we trash?,4
i think even mi fans want kxip to win for the memes,9
MI maintaining the culture of losing to the worst teams and beating the best,7
MI is in trouble for a change.,2
Hardik... that hairstyle ain't it,3
Hardick Pandya with that flat pitch on the head,2
I'm still not confident tbh,4
Arshdeep is really impressive. Both him and Bishnoi have been perhaps the only positives in an otherwise disappointing bowling attack.,4
seems like MI is fed up of winning. xD,1

Where's dugout commentary?,2
[deleted],4
De Cock smashing Arshdeep...,2
[deleted],1
De kock is in his peak form,3
Good test for mi middle order,3
Now who is the best wicket keeper batsmen in India for T20Is barring Rahul,1
3 wickets gone but at least the runs have come at an OK rate. These two need to stick around for 5-6 overs at least,3
This is actually Mumbai rehearsing a collapse if it were to occur one during the playoffs and testing their middle order.,6
Where is dugout,4
"Arshdeep looks good tbh

Been impressed every game I've seen him in, bowls decent lines, not bad at the death and he's got a solid temperament",4
We'll probably see Bumrah bat today.,8
"Yeah he's a difficult guy to bowl to, but even if he wasn't, would gentle medium pace aimed short and wide to give him width be the way to go?",2
Rohit and kishan needs to bat properly ..,2
Mi playing like RR lol,1
Maxi is actu a better bowler than he's given credit for,4
Having NCN instead of Pattinson could be massive today,3
Why don‚Äôt they ever trust pollard to bat long . In this kind of form he is he should be batting as much as possible,3
No dugout today?,2

[deleted],9
Didn't the timer run out?,3
Wtf is happening,8
Why the hell 1 more time ffs,5
"The reason why Krunal has been sent in is because this has been his role in the past. Anchoring the innings in case everybody falls early. Although I wouldn't have preferred this, it's a silver lining in that Krunal gets practice, in case this happens in a more crucial match later.",5
If MI lose here and DC loses to KXIP later all of the top 3 will have lost to the meme team,19
Are u fucking kidding me ? Wtf is this umpire review,8
Wtf üòÖüòÖüòÖ,3
What even is this review for.,11
Kl must've seen dhawans dream11 advt,9
Delhi is clearly better than Mumbai,-10
How the fuck do you appeal that??,10
Why was this reviewed,5
[removed],6
Bc umpire dekh bhi nahi raha,5
All aboard the Axar Patel all 3 format star for India train,3
Was that a review? I don‚Äôt think so,3
It wasn't a team review. It was the umpire review,6
We just got 3 overs out of Maxwell lmao,12
I am convinced that MI is still going to score 180+,11
"3 runs from Maxi

Awesome lol",4
LMAO. This is one of the best reviews along with Buttler's appeal for the Finch LBW.,4
"Whew, it was close call that appeal. - N O T -",5
Finally Maxwell is doing something useful.,10
"Bowl Bishnoi, hes great against lefties",2
"Maxwell bowls 4 overs : KXIP wins



Simple",5
You fucking people it was an umpire review. KXIP still have their 1 review.,9

Good idea to bowl gayle?,9
MI scores 46 for 3 in 7 overs....is this the RCB-A or KXIP?,8
Oh i forgot coulternile was playing. We have batting till 8,9
What tf was that decision.,4
They should give bowl a couple overs for the memes,6
MI just needs to steal rabada and archer and they'd probably have a team that could win the t20 world cup.,12
Smh good attempt,3
Do you think cricketers get bored,2
I reckon Mumbai will go to 190,4
3 cheap overs,3
Fuck Pandya brothers are just jackpot for Mumbai,67
why isnt hooda bowling,3
What a shot,2
"Bad line CJ, go back to where u bowled it prev",2
Will cummins and pattinson stop playing at the end? Maybe rest and recharge for the india tour? Maybe thats why lockie and NCN are being played now,2
Who did lockie play in place of?,8
thats a cricket 19 shot,5

a lot of sanath jayasuriya in that shot,8
I would love to see de Kock rip it apart today,6
If punjab wins this and csk loses to rr tomorrow my lifelong dream of seeing csk at the bottom of the table will be fulfilled,58
A tied super over obviously.,21
"Great over all things considered

CJ looks more confident too",12

JORDAN you're supposed to be the best fielder,10
"Funny to see that Gayle is listed as an allrounder on the teamsheet in espncricinfo, wonder if he'll get an over",18
MI is all set for the flamingo from El Boulto today.,20
Some lazy fielding there,6
A dive would have been futile considering he would have crashed into the boundary in about 0.5 seconds.,5
Sr Pandya always pulls of such inning once every season.,37
"This calmness even after losing 3 top wickets... KXIP fans, do you ever experience this?",6
MI needs a great de Kock knock today because of the wickets falling out early on.,5
24 from 4 maxwell overs what a fucking steal,41
"60 after 9 overs is prime CSK,",6
Maxwell been economical lol,2
Maxwell doing it with the bowling atm getting 4 overs from him for 24 runs. Definitely valuable for the team,1
"Maxwell bowled 4 overs at 6rpo

Gg Mumbai",2
lmao they let maxwell bowl 4 overs for 24,1
That's called escorting ball to boundary.,3
Missed the start of the game. Did we shoot ourselves in the foot or have Punjab been exceptional?,6
"Guys, what might be the strategy for making Krunal bat now? Can anyone tell me plz? Sorry for my ignoranceüôèüèΩ",2
Need to accelerate from now on. Already they‚Äôve gotten away with 4 overs for Maxwell cheaply.,1
Why did Maxwell bowl 4 overs lmao,5
"KXIP really put the 'death' in death bowling and I don't like their chances vs a Pollard or a Hardik.  
Pressure on Jordan to justify his place in the team today",3
"Can‚Äôt justify dropping Maxwell cuz he‚Äôs sleeping with the management so they ask him to bowl out early. 

200 IQ from Rahul",6
"Question: If KXIP wins this one, are they still in it? SRH, CSK, RR and KXIP will all have 6 points. We have seen today that KKR can F up!",6
Apparently Maxi can do everything apart from batting,6
"We are yet to see who could probably be our most threatening bowlers, Bishnoi and Ashwin.",2
"Guys, how did MI lose wickets? I got here late",1
Feel like it's krunal's day today,1
Maxwell is KXIP's Sundar,3
Good to see our economical bowler Maxwell finally stepping up to fulfil his role,7
"Mumbai have great chance in this season.

With every win they defeat csk again and again.",4
Maxwell has already done the job of a front line bowler.,3
Maxwell doing well with the ball and Cummins with the bat.,10
Part timer completing his quota of 4 at just 24 runs is a crime in t20,15
Trust a team like MI to bring maxwell back to form.,10
DC fans who are hoping that MI lose today so that they can retain their number one spot should know that no other team other than MI have won the IPL finishing first. (From 2011 onwards as playoff system came into effect then),12
Need a Pollard special today to get us to 170 odd,3
"Hope kxip wins this, mi will smash kkr next match anyways",6
Not surprised. We have always been the Robin Hoods of IPL. Taking points from the rich and giving them to the poor.,55
Finishing Maxwell's spell early is a good move considering how under pressure MI are. He would get smashed around if they send him later.,7
"Did maxwell bowl badly LOL, why is everyone being so cheebai about his figures?",5
[deleted],6
Umpire referral have made review restrictions largely redudnant.,2
"Sorry I‚Äôm late y‚Äôall, I had to take a break after the last game and go cry in a corner.",55
"Not Gayle's fault but Why is he even fielding, send Neesham",2
"Maxwell has been pretty economical the last couple of matches where they've bowled him out first up, looks a good strategy to get 4 economic overs out of a part-timer (but ofc it reduces their wicket-taking ability in the power play, not that that matters today)",2
I think bowling a leg spinner to a left hander was a bad idea,6
Is this in Sharjah?,0
Gayle looks like Dad of BOI with that beard,9
Ashwin bowls a lot of googlies that the leg spinner is his variation.,6
"Makes no sense to hold back legspinners 
 
It's not like Hardik and Pollard are going to struggle against them",1

MI is trying to get CSK into finals so that we can beat them again. Nice strategy,6
[deleted],3
All googlies is a little too predictable,2
Who's that chicküëÄ,4
Who was that in grey t shirt,6
does someone know who that girl was?,7

KL: yes",9
HoodaüòÇüòÇüòÇ why's he even playing lol,3
These girls are something else,6
"Even in an empty stadium these cameramen are finding hot girls.



My inspiration.",14
Poor field placement,1
Her name is Suhasni Chandra,6
Kishan is the only weak link in MI. Lacks maturity as well,3
Hooda looks like post rehab Kabir singh,2
Still can't get over how Deepak Hooda was in front of me and I still could not recognise him,3
"I was fapping for Krunal's cut shot, then this weird creature appears",15
Fill up your water pitchers lads y'all are beyond thirsty haha,11
Krunal pandya > Jadeja currently,-5
"To the guy who was asking why doesnt Hooda bowl: this is why

He is a bit part player, with both the bits being very small",10
"Both the Pathan brothers and the Pandya bros played for Baroda. I'm guessing all 4 might have been in the team for a while too.  
Kinda surprised by the fact that Baroda got nowhere with 4 India-level players",6
"Hooda is the most overrated IPL player, if ever there was one",6
"MI - sends Krunal because he is a good player of spin

KXIP - Lets bowl some shitty part time spinners",19
"If u let them away for a few more overs,it‚Äôll be as if nothing happened and they can still easily get 200 with the guys they have to come in",6
Weird strategy not bowling Bishnoi here,4
"\*IPL Cameraman\* Focus on a lady

r/cricket Who she? Hottaayy...",52
This is a different Hooda to the one who was in SRH right?,1
This is poor bowling by Hooda. Everything's been short,1
Need more pressure. Bring on Shami. This is not the period to snooze my man Rahul,1
"Bowl yourself Rahul, you coward",6
Pretty sure MI will retain all the players at this rate.,4
Girl no match for our altroz,11

How much must it kill them to flog that car?,2
"Guys pls pls tell her name


Asking for research purpose",-10
"You look at Bishnoi, and tell me he's not Afghan",4
"Krunal has batted sensible :( 

Let's break this partnership!",5
KXIP are in trouble as long as The Cock is still out there,5
U should always have left - right combo in Dubai cuz one boundary is short,4
Who should come next? Pollard or Hardik? Pollard makes much more sense but he hasn't batted for more than week IRRC,3
Hardik rn abusing the fuck outta MI management for sending his bro and not him,12
"Rahul's strategy might be good, if KXIP's top bowlers failed to take any wickets, death overs will be a disaster with Hardik and Pollard on each end",4
"Teams are struggling to chase anything over 160 unless you are DC, MI or someone does an AB",4
Please retain DeKock at all cost MI and don't give in to Krunal is Hardik's brother emotion like you did in Butler's case,7
Waiting for KL Rahul and gayle to bowl,4
"Mini rant- if we depended on Rohit's batting , like RCB depends on VK or CSK depended on yesteryear MS, we'd have never nearly been as successful as we have been. I'm not talking about winning trophies, because that's completely different beast. Just a team that has a decent record.",6
Downvoting thirst messages. Not meant for a live cricket thread,7
"I really want KXIP to win, fuck can y'all get a wicket already... Like the bowling's been so cringe",2
Will we see the iconic duo of **Hardik-de Kock** today?,4
Krunal trying to play for the spin,3
Why does Bishnoi have such  a long runup?,3
"Obituary reminder that in the earlier match against KXIP, MI were 85-3 and then the shitstorm ensured",2
"Shots like this make me believe, jaddu will always be better then KPandya",3
Kinda disrespectful to bishnoi that his captain doesn't trust him enough to bowl against left-handers,2
Who's gonna bowl next? Kumble?,2
Is MI willing to trade hardik ?,-4
Dont save Shami for death,1
How does sex feel like the first time. Male virgin here,5
"With so many spinners, polly should've been pushed up",2
Not sure if Ashwin is a leg spinner or an off spinner,3
Need üÖ±Ô∏èOundaries brother,3
Mash should just call himself a specialist googly bowler,5
It's a good idea to get all your spinners to bowl now. Hardik and Pollard give zero fucks against spinners.,6
Too short,1
Bishnoi's run-up is longer than Russell's in that last over,7
MI ownership literal fat cats,0
Just bowl shami lol,1
Gayle did better than I thought he would. Gg boss,9
Just bowl a leggie already lmao,3
Off topic question : can y'all speak fluently and sensibly just like captains at post match presentation?,2
"Why not just say ""Ashwin""? There's only 1 Ashwin playing an IPL match at this current moment, so we all know who you're talking about.",3
Lol that four üòÇ,1
Double bluff from De Kock haha,2
[deleted],24
This is poor by everyone involved,3
amazing placement /s,4
"Mumbai push Pollard so far down the order he hasnt batter in over a week, wont be surprised if hes out of form now.",5
[deleted],0
Is Pooran a keeper? I forgot,2
De cock is pretty underrated probably because he is very quite.,7
Good over. Need 10+ in the next or someone needs to get out,3
"kxip are a really great side. if other teams want to win against them, ok",2
Can't even imagine how peaceful it's to be an MI fan.,6
"Save Murugan for Hardik. 

Use Bish against lefties and attack with Shami. Please dont save him for death ffs",4
I think it's time death lver slogging starts. With Pollard and Pandya to come better maximise the 7 overs left.,2
"Til that Bishnoi's grandfather was former Haryana Chief Minister ,Bhajan Lal.",7
"Mumbai around 10 runs short here? Should try and cover up, 170 would look fine",1
I get why KL Rahul doesn't keep for India. He is pretty average at it.,10
Just swap shami for kumble already,3
Why doesn't Pooran keep? He is a specialist. Missing anything?,3
Come on let's break this partnership,1
"That was poor from Rahul, he failed to predict the trajectory by a huge margin",5
If this is a spinner friendly pitch then we might get to see rohit bowl. I am calling hattrick.,3
I didn't watch the starting overs. Did Ro-hit de *Cock* Arsedeep already happen?,2
13 overs gone and KXIP have used 7 bowlers. Let Gayle also bowl then.,6
"Krunal having better SR then Gill, invest wisely in the future  /dont kill me",2
IPL coaching is the ultimate pension plan for cricketers,3
Why is KXIP bowling so bad? It feels like they have no good bowling.,3
Rahul's captaincy and keeping still a bit suspect,4
Bishnoi is annoyingly good on his days. Quality spinner.,5
Just get out already,0
Krunal should start hitting in the air now,3
"LHBs struggling with random off spinners, and there was Gambhir who dealt with 3 of them(one of them being Murali) in a WC final at Wankhede.",18
Bishnoi just came,2
Gayle has been fire on the field today.,5
Every year krunal pandya perform in one match throught the ipl. I think tonight is that match,11
Gayle best fielder,6
Noice Bish,7
Tjat was so fucking close,5
"Gayle , the best fielder on the field now.",7
Tactical wicket,10
Fuck me. I knew he was gonna pick one.,3
Letzooooo,4
Watching Gayle field is kind of hilarious.,6
[removed],-7
Nah Preity that hairstyle ain't it,8
Hardik-De Kock incumming!,6
Please send Pollard. Hardik can finish,5
Great catch Hooda. Bishnoi keeps being great against Left handers.,4
I wonder how much Bishnoi's long run up adds to his deliveries. Perhaps it gives his balls a bit of a zip or something?,2
"

Bishnoi fuck yeah,2
Jonti Gayle rofl,3
"Krunal played a decent knock. Now to hit the pedal. 

Just send pollard ffs.",3
Thala just cummed.,2
don't mind it tbh,2
Did Ro-hit de **Cock** Arsedeep already happen?,6
YES,1
Man i know hindsight is 20-20 but why wasn't Bishnoi bowled earlier. He is the best bowler we have,2
Ajay Devgan's out,8
It‚Äôs kind of peaceful to watch when your team sucks and has low chance of making the playoffs. Just get to watch cricket for cricket‚Äôs sake,6
Which ground is this?,3
Ffs. It's hardik. Why are we so reluctant to promote polly,4
Deepak Hooda has aged 10 years since 2018,4
you fools youve unleashed pollard and hardik,2
Bishnoi really has been a good find this season. He has improved massively since his nervous start in the first match.,6
"When Krunal Pandya came in, you‚Äôd say his role was to keep the runs ticking and delay Hardik/Pollard‚Äôs entry until the 13-14th over. With that in mind, he‚Äôs done his job perfectly. Very astute captaincy from Rohit too",11
Who came out? Hardick or daddy Pollard?,2
This is actually good. Now pandya and de kock can smash the ball,5
THE ICONIC HARDIK-DE KOCK PARTNERSHIP IS HERE!,6
"**13.5** Ravi Bishnoi to KH Pandya, OUT, full, outside leg, Pandya tries the sweep, but this comes off the toe end for a smart catch for Hooda at deep square leg **96-4**

KH Pandya c Hooda b Ravi Bishnoi 34 (30b 4x4 1x6) SR: 113.33",2
yeah sex and all is great but have you seen mindians shitting their pants against a 7th/8th side!???!??? üí¶,1
Is top 4 fixed now?,-1
De Kock and Polly gotta go big here and try and salvage this.,1
[deleted],11
BISHI MY BOY üí¶üëÖ,0
42 yr old Gayle is a better fielder than 30 yr old Gayle for some reason.,15
This was Bishnoi's worst ball so far today and it got him wicket. Cricket is a funny game,6
Brohit is just hitting his quota of 3-4 fours and becoming Nohit,8
Hard dick and de cock again,1
The one time I‚Äôm ok with the horny cameraman is when there‚Äôs Preity on screen,10
"This subreddit is becoming more like a Facebook page lol.


All that's missing is ""Admit it..."" posts.",16
"Hardik - De Kock - Arshdeep 

amazing.",5
"These two should bat till the end now.

Hard-dick de Cock Arse-deep",6
"Actually I think krunal's inning was a good one
He provided stability after early wickets
Gave time to de cock to settle perfectly so he can go on fire at the end",4
Instagram reels ad is the same level as Josh,6
"Daily reminder

Pollard is younger to Rohit Sharma. 

Piyush Chawla is younger to Virat.",102
That 4 by Pandya could have easily been saved by a simple drive by the kxip fielder.,8
Suryakumar is the new samson.,-2
Who knew that Murali Kartik would actually turn out to be an okay commentator,9
Need 170 here to be competitive,7
"Hardik and De Kock

Swan must be giggling furiously",7
Of course the sTrAtEgIc tImEoUt had to cockblock this partnership,6
Wow what a shot for a first ball,4
Showed what MI is,2
Should hv sent polly,2
Lmao. No fucks given,3
Chad Hardick,3
"Again I am telling 
MI gonna make 190",4
Nice shot Hardik,3
Lmfao wtf Hardik,5
Why tf does the team management send pollard at 7? He's not a tail ender ffs,3
"A, finally sanga on comms",3
Fuckboi style!,2
And so it begins !!,1

Hardik got no chill,1

Chapri did it,1
Chad Hardik vs Virgin Bishnoi,2
"Leg or offspinners doesn't really affect Hardik, He'll hit them all",7
Fuckboi First Ball Six!,5
I predict KXIP will be 90-0 then all out for 140,6
Signing in for dick and cock jokes...,9
"Last six overs , KXIP bowling 100 runs anyone?",6
For what reason are we saving shami for the end,6
"QDK should just rotate strike. He's the set man, hardik can do the hitting.",4
Tewatia or Krunal,1
Stop already with the Hardik and de Kock jokes,1
How does Pollard look unfit but simultaneously so athletic? Can he share those powers to Rohit?,7
"feel like pure shit, just wanna see a bishnoi 4-fer",3
"For a scrawny man, Hardik can really generate a lot of power in his hitting",4
Hardik has karke aaya today...,4
The penile pair will power through!!,3
Miss seeing you in KXIP colors Mahela ü•∫,8
Mahela and Sanga pretending they're not soulmates here.,7
Shouldn‚Äôt have gone with Ashwin this over,3
QDK's finding form at the right stage has been such a boon for us.,4
I went away for like 10 minutes why was everyone horny,3
"Do you guys think mods should ban image-posts altogether? 

Need serious thoughts.",-1
Rohit is pretty athletic,2
Daddy Quinton,3
Oh shit sanga is in the comms,5
De Kock has been playing the field so well recently,4
You hate to see it,5
"Once again our Favorite pair in action, De Kock and Hardik",4
Harddick and De Cock partnership is the best,3

You don't have to slow down",8
I predict 185+,4
Is Sangakkara doing commentary today?,5
Someone make a fanfic of Sanga-Mahela please.,11
Penile Power Trip is too OP,3
Sanga and Mahela reunion,9
Krunal got dismissed at the right time tbh.,3
Sanga sledging mahela üòÇ,6

'Hardik - de Kock' jokes: Abhi hum zindaa hai",7
Mahela woman getting turned on by the Hardick deKock,3
Man quinton is in such a great form,4

Sanga and Mahela banter hahahaha",9
Replacing KP with Sanga might be the greatest replacement of all time,23
Swanny laughing in the background lol.,4
"Bro, this burn back and forth between Sangakara and Jayawardhane..",20
Mahela-Sanga banter üòç,5
BANTAH,3
As a Kings XI fan I wish MI management listened to their fans and brought in Chris Lynn,4
Punjab are not gonna win chasing 190+ with the kind of bowling MI has.,2
We've managed to get atleast 10 runs from every Ashwin over without taking too many risks.,2
Sanga and Mahela üòÇüòÇ,4
Lol Jayawardane.,3
Only 11 runs in the over so faar,5
Haha Hard dick and the cock together üò≥üò≥ ü§£,6
"If there's one team which can defeat MI by meme'ing their way to a win, that's KXIP",5
We had DeKock in our side & we gave him in platter to MI that was one of the worst decision by RCB. Nehra said we released him as we had PP as same profile player.,12
Sanga and Mahela are gems.,4
Holy shit Sanga got it right back,9
ahh love the banter between sanga and mahela,8
Sanga and Mahela roasting each other. üòÇ,13
Miss having more Sri Lankan players in the IPL,7
Mahela just sent Sanga back to quarantine,12
QDK is much more reliable than Nohit Sharma as opener.,5
"Mahela and sanga trolling each other , we need more of this casual banter during the game",7
Sanga/Mahela sledging for life HAHAHA,9
Legendary ball busting among the two legends,11
Off topic : is it official that a huge stadium will be built in jaipur?,2
Sanga-Mahela would be great on comm together,4
[deleted],8
"Mahela won that little battle with Sanga there I think, great banter.",7
Maxi quota will hit mi now if not for his overs hardik would have probably killed some spinners todays,2
Can someone fill me in on the sanga/mahela banter? Currently only following scores,5
What a weird ad that was by vivo,2
"Mayank, KL and Gayle are all in form. We need 170 minimum",7
Can someone tell what did Sanga say to Mahila?,2
"Someone pls stop Josh , they are bringing too much cringe in here.   


Will also be an economic failure probably",1
No bull shit anchoring innings with 120 SR.... everyone comes hard,7
"You know what..Its always so much fun to listen to good friends..

The amount of roasting which happens is hilarious but usually its so light hearted..",6
"QDK‚Äôs 3 consecutive 50s.. great batting, now take it to the end and let hardik play some knock.",6
I love Mahela but hate MI. I don't really like this combination,6

Swanny on suicide watch.,4
Kunal wasted too many balls,-3
a bit premature from the fuckboi,7
"Too much dick energy, MI couldn't contain it",6
Hardik just hasn't been in the zone this season,6
That was a Sharjah shot,3
We are fucked.,0
NICKY PPPPP,1
"r/cricket expecting a lot from Pollard today.

Pollard: shits the bed with a 3(5)",10
Polly plz,1
How many times are you going to get out like that Hardik?,4
Pollard is coming too late for MI. He should be coming at 5. He has an average of 150+ this year for gods sake.,2
Daddy Pandya not the same as koffee Pandya,20
"Honestly kinda surprised SKY never got a match with India. Ik India has like 2 full teams waiting on the fringes, but he‚Äôs been class for years now",7
"**15.3** Mohammed Shami to HH Pandya, OUT, hard length. Shami bowls the only thing that works against Hardik Pandya **116-5**

HH Pandya c Pooran b Mohammed Shami 8 (4b 0x4 1x6) SR: 200.00",2
Mumbai can‚Äôt literally win on a particular ground and r/cricket experts think they are the most balanced team in the tournament lol.,-18
Did the dugout just jinx Hardick,3
I am still trying to figure out how will Punjab fuck up tonight.,6
They've got a good opening to a win here. Not gonna be easy to deal with MI's on-fire bowling unit but Kings gotta take advantage of the great position they're in.,6
Punjab Slayer is here ffs,4
"Lemme have a go now.


Hardik leaves de kock hanging alone in there .",9
"other fielders: oh, the ball is running for a boundary let me accelerate my speed and put in a desperate dive, if necessary.

kxip fielders today: oh shit, I might soon catchup to the ball hindering its crossing of a boundary, let me reduce my speed and be a little gentle! Cricket is a gentleman's game after all.",8
Fuccboi gone too soon,2
"Quinny's already batted 15+ overs and will have to keep as well

Big workload for him",11
MI just got cockblocked off this partnership.,6
Incoming simps,7
Pollard always performs against KXIP. Don't get surprised if he scores 52(17) or something,6
Insane that KXIP have 7 bowling options,1
u/poochi please change bot's flair to KXIP. There is no need to meme RCB anymore.,9
So Shami just cockblocked this partnership,7
Hardik's trim is awful,8
Smash or get-out. This why Jr Pandya gets promoted ahead of Polly.,5
Only if fuckboi could spend more time on the pitch than he does posting cringe wannabe black material on instagram,11
Ok here is how MI watch pollard bat. First dots so we insult him and question his place in the team. Then he goes mad and hits it all around the park.,9
Wtf happened to pandya?,10
Hardik should sue his barber.,32
Hardik Bickle?,2
What an over that,8
"Tuned in just now, Is Hardik the last Airbender?",14
Even nile can hit right??,6
"okay bois run fest on the cards, hope Gayle goes berserk tonight...",3
Hand the ball to Arsh,5
Pandu can't play short ball. It's been 4 years and he is still the same.,8
"If kxip wins this, all the bottom teams will have the same points",6
Why did Kevin Pollard shave the beard?,3
Taxi driver Hardik,-1
Most teams have good spin options while we just have Chahar and Krunal. They yet the job done but they aren't premier spinners by any means,3
What could possibly go wrong for KXIP?,5
Have a look at MI's scorecard if you haven't. Looks unusual.,4
I don't know how bald people should feel with Hardik's hairstyle!,3
Why not Arshdeep?,2
No matter what mi score you can expect the match to go down to the last ball,6
Swell over from Shami.,2
CSK or RR?,-2
WTH the lord is at 3rd place in mvp race,8
Archer is leading MVP table. First time for a proper bowler i guess.,7
"MI dugout of out batsmen with Nohit, Kishan, Pandyas et al be like: ""The league of extraordinarily lazy gentleman"".",1
"Mahela: The food is pretty good, though the menu is limited.

Sanga: Yeah, We can see that clearly (on you)  üòÇ

watching Sanga boy & Mahela pull each other's leg is so wholesome.",14
Is it just me or Quinton de Kock always looks as if he's been crying his eyes out?,56
even qdk struggling to hit here. something is going on with the pitch i reckon?,11
So now is the time we predict a new method for kxip to choke?,4
De kock cocked up,3
Oh boy we are collapsing.,8
Cool cool cool,3
So the top 4 pretty much look certain now. MI DC RCB and KKR.,2
[deleted],1
Mi falling apart,3
That should've been out of the park lmao,6
No dropped catches today. COLOR ME SHOCKED!,4
Maushichi g**nd,4
KKR and KXIP revival on the same day???,4
"Alright, now where's the guy who said MI will make 190?",1
"If you are a specialist hitter, on any particular day if you don't manage to keep your SR, atleast you should manage to score decent runs. All or nothing doesnt help",5
I still believe we go to 160,1
All right we need a KXIP choke to win this now,11
150 is difficult for MI now.,3
Let's do constructive criticism.... I'm up for it,3
Bad timing to get out... De kock,3
De Kock has stopped working,2
Uh oh. Need a Polly masterclasss,1
Not our day today,1
We're fucked. No way Pollard can get us to anything big all by himself,1
CJ is back babyyyyy (apologies if this jinxes it),3
de Kock goes back inside,2
Where the arrogant MI fans now?,3
NCN can hit,2
"**16.3** Jordan to de Kock, OUT, the slowness of the pitch showing. This is a length ball, into the pads, something de Kock loves to pick-up over the leg side. But this has come off the bottom of the bat, and he caught at deep square **119-6**

Q de Kock c Agarwal b Jordan 53 (43b 3x4 3x6) SR: 123.25",3
After the first match this is the first time MI has lost their 6th wicket in this IPL....,3
How fucking long is their batting,5
KXIP had so much potential. They just didn't get the proper 11 at the start of the tournament.,8
No more cock memes. Smh. *It was fun while it lasted*.,3
Who is the woman next to Preity Zinta?,2
I think commentators have done inception and made MI believe that they cannot win here.,3
"Bruh what the fuck are these Flipkart ads honestly

It's like they spent all the money in sourcing these A-list celebs. Lol, they forgot to pay the creative dept.",4
160 seems like a distant dream for MI. KXIP did well today.,2
"KXIP manages to keep de Kock quite and get MI's wicket. DC: scribbles notes. For real though, looks like MI can't play slow bowlers, experiment with Sams instead of Nortje or Rabada?",1
This pitch looks so slow it's impossible to go big on unless you use the pace of the bowler. Pollards bowling might come into play here.,2
When csk wants mumbai to win they do this.,3
All MI fans commenting  wanting De Cock out cuz he wasnt batting very fast should be happy now eh?,6
Damn! Punjab really knows how to get you into the game.,1
Sending hardik infront of Pollard was and is a bad idea. Pollard takes time to set. Expecting 160 if he stays on.,2
MI has a good middle order on paper. But they rely too much on the top order.,-4
TBH de Kock has been quite consistent though since the last few matches. Contributed again today.,6
So no Arshdeep to Hardik/De Kock memes wtf is even the point of this match anymore,5
With Punjab's chasing anything is possible,7
"KXIP Supporters to Jordan:

""Main tere ko haraami samajhta tha, tu toh dev manus nikla re""",8
Match is perfectly set for a kl 75(88),9
KXIP should get Polard and maybe Coulter Nile ASAP,2
Graeme Swann absolutely going at it with the dirty humor lol,6
When are RCB gonna have that green jersey match,8
KXIP has a chance to reach 5th on points table today.,10
Reminder that Coulter Nile absolutely destroyed the West indies on his way to a 92 in the world cup.,8
Still can't understand y fuccboi is sent above Polly,3
160 is still achievable. MI bowlers will have some target to defend.,3
O boy...here we go.... 60 in 3 overs,4
And so it begins,9
Pollard show started. Oh no,5
One of the main reasons why Pollard has so much impact is because he chooses his bowlers and bats without ego,13
Pollard is a Unit,10
Arsedeep is gonna get rekt,3
I really don't want arsh to get hit :(,9
Important over for KXIP,9
Arshdeep runs like tom for tom and jerry,8
Pollard and NCN at 7 & 8 is an insane luxury.,12
Jeez Pollard hits the most effortless sixes down the ground. 2 in a row!,13
Pollard gets out this over,2
Daddy is back ü•∞,5
That was actually a good Yorker.,5
"Pollard is a fucking bank for MI. 

Delivers. Every. Time.",11
Beards overrated. Most cricketers are looking better after shaving.,7
Pollard: Abhi hum zindaa hai!!,9
Rank ball that got the treatment,2
Bouncer incoming,3
Arshdeep is in deep trouble here. This over is crucial.,2
Rekt,2
"Waiting to hear, he is a Big Unit, is pollard from one of the comms.now",2
Today we performed 40% and it does look competitive,8
Making it look so easy,3
Game on,2
god I hate Pollard so much,2
PoLord,1
He is too good.,1
Polly doing what polly does.,1
What's the fielder doing behind the Umpire,3
"This makes me wonder why the fuck doesn't Pollard come at 5, surely Krunal and Hardik can come later?",3
What did we do to you Pollard? Every single time man.,7
game changing over incoming,2
Even if Pollard mishit it will reach six.,3
Bouncer is the best way to go.,3
You got pollared,3
KXIP I really want to see you guys in the final with RCB. C'mon,6
Pollard is so clutch man MI is blessed to have him,3
Now 2 sixes from Coutlter nile,2
Damn MI bats deep.,7
"Pollard is the best batsman this IPL.

If he was in any other team, he would have batted at 4 or 5 to make even bigger contributions.",5
Pollard: My turn.,1
6ix Poll-ution,2
Pollard being harsh to Arsh,2
"6 wickets down, they can still score 140-150. Too OP Mumbai",7
Arshdeep or arse deeped?,-3
Bowling full toss to Pollard is suicide,3
Rahul looking like he going through PTSD,9
"Polly wants a sixer, I think he should get on strike first",4
Imagine having a team so strong that Pollard is your #7 batsman,89
Lucky NCN,2
"Aw man, unlucky",4
Polly has rediscovered himself and is hitting Well consistently without looking risky..hightime dre Russ learns from him,7
Coulter nile batting at 8 is a luxury as someone mentioned in this thread,12
Pollard turns the fuck up against kxip,3
I get irritated looking at KL. For no reason,3
Just every fucking time.,5
Lol @ Kumble.,5
Can't believe 6 wickets are down,7
Some teams have all the luck in the world.,12
How the hell can any team beat this! Insane,10
Ffs why don't you dive,6
Too OP dismantle this franchise,13
What the fuck Arshdeep?,4
These two can easily score 45+ in remaining balls.,3
This is in trouble arshdeep. Both of them are starting their fireworks.,3
Rahul needs some serious mental health counseling after this ipl,12
Yessss go mumbai,2
Why did Pooran give up so close to the ball??,4
Deep ko diaper pehnao behenchod,6
180 possible?,1
"Jordan gave just 12 runs in 2 overs!!!!!?

Yea, KXIP rode their luck as far as they could with that :P",4
"NCN will now play above Pattinson, for such collapse",5
Thank you Arsh,3
Why did the commentator have to remind me of that NCN World Cup knock.,15
"Rahul getting in pressure here.

I think he will bowl fuckin gowtham in the last over again here.",8
What an over though,3
"Me before this over: Hope they don't get 160 
Me after this over : Hope it's only 160",16
Arshdeep got fucked arsedeep,1
"KXIP - Phew finally got Pollard to the other end.

NCN - hold my long levers.",10
Feels really bad for punjab. They should be sitting in the top 4 with 10 points but alas here we are,8
Pollard is only 33 lol ....so Mumbai are favourites for atleast next 5 years.,13
Zero retention policy required next auction just to dismantle this op franchise,5
Rahul is a shit captain,0
"Had NCN's bowling been better, he could have been a real asset for the Aussies",3
Don't know whether to love AssDeep or hate him,-1
Still saying 190 is possible,2
What's the par score on this ground?,1
Ah Punjab getting hammered in the death again,5
Mi new batdeep??,7
"Oh man, young bowler. Is always gonna get hit one of those days. 

Hope he comes back better next game.",3
"Pollard at  the other end thinking 

""This MF bowls as well, spot in danger!!!""",8
in b4 mi score 190,2
It's fascinating how an over can change the situation for both of the teams.,5
Goddamn is this the best ever MI team? Still striking back afer so much damage,8
Take 6 wickets. Batsman with 170 strike rate comes in crease.,11
They're getting 170 aren't they,2
Sluggish innings by MI but somehow 160 is still achievable. Incredible.,5
Sorry but Rahul is too fragile to be a captain. Love  him tho.,1
KXIP don't play well for the last 3 overs of each innings and it costs them the match.,3
Rahul has to be the worst captain in this ipl. Jordan has two overs left but he can't finish his spell.,6
"I simply avoid watching kxip in death bowling/batting, for mental health reasons",5
Braindead captaincy still prevails: bowl your worst bowler in the 20th over because there is a chance that folks get out before that. They have to hit in the 18th and 20th anyway.,3
Can score 170+,1
Only elite bowlers in purple Cap list,3
"Mark Nicholas really seems to feel for these young Indian cricketers and want them to do well.. I used to think him somewhat condescending, but his feelings for the Indian youngsters to do well seem to be genuine.",6
Oh fuckkk,1
"I'm just happy Shami is bowling well, looking good.",1
"Coming on to the bat very nicely, 160-70 seems below par",1
Saala ye batting khatam Kaahe nahi ho raha be,8
So this is classic MI for you! This Pollard dude always fucking always comes between whenever MI is in trouble and plays such inning :),8
"Lol that ball went into orbit and it still landed safe, so lucky to get away with that",6
How high did that fucking go,12
Pollard sees RCB and KXIP : *cracks knuckles*,7
Mumbai Indians are just a team full of match winners. It's not even fair at this point.,15
"Rahul is flustered, not the best reaction from a captain",6
"Jesus wtf, why KL wasn't running hard to take the catch",10
That went into the moon and still landed in between fielders lol,7
NCN is ready to explode. He's either going to get bowled out hit a six on the legside.,7
How much did MI pay for NCN  ? i like it,7
"Maxwell just went for 6 in his quota, many are talking about letting him go but these are the things that go unnoticed until the player has left the team.",8
"Since we give away 20 runs in last over, 170+ will be very tough to chase.",3
MI have all the luck in the world,3
"160 is so achievable, give me 170 MI.",6
Lol this team is unbeatable. They‚Äôll not even lose this year.,22
My god....,4
"Poor ball

They are getting 180 arent they lmao",8
NCN slogging the shit out of the bat,8
"Kind reminder

El Boulto is still holding his flamingo in the dugout ready to unleash the pink power",9
MI are so Batdeep‚Ñ¢ it should be illegal. RCB were scared AF after losing 3 wickets yesterday,70
NCN baby,3
[deleted],111
Me Nathuram Coulter Nile boltoy,11
How do all the teams batting against KXIP have hitters till no. 8 and we have only 5 proper batsmen,14
Hows that missed the stumps,3
Damn that yorker on the fifth ballüòç,3
Why does shami bowl slower balls even though he's so bad at it. Somebody tell him. I'd rather he gets smashed for 6 trying to bowl a yorker.,2
Did that seam away from the stumps? Wtf,5
Fuck you Mumbai Indians you fucking overpowered cunts! and every other team this is the thing going to happen with you if you even manage to make into finals and get the top order cheaply :),12
NCN gg.,3
O fuck MI‚Äôs batting almost as dominant as England‚Äôs,9
"Wow. Uhh right.. soo, clearly the plan was to get NCN some batting time and confidence which then translates into his bowling.

Obviously..",5
"If ncn starts bowling at 8 or 9 rpo and bats like this.

He is worth it.",8
So now we have 4 finishers?,10
NCN with rub of green...,4
Coulter nile just swatting away bouncers with the high luck stat,9
Absolute garbage field placement,4
Perfect NCN. I will take 12 in Shami's over with NCN on strike. Now onto Pollard.,7
One six and hand it over to pollard ncn,4
"This crowd DJ is really on point with his ""oohs"" and ""ahs""",2
Maa ki chut plot armor ki,9
Mile hits a mile,1
We need at least 3 wickets in PP to.have any chance,1
whyyyyy go short....,2
ffs Shami how can you be this shit when you can see him struggling to play yorks,2
NCN's scored 10 out of 3 bouncers while mishitting all of them,3
Mf why would would try 10 diff things when you can bowl such a good yorker. Shami chutiya behnchod.,7
Polly 170+ pls,2
Why always Punjab¬ø,3
"The teams have a pretty big entourage, don't they? There are so many ""spectator"" type individuals besides the team..",2
"MI can defend 170 though, so that would be a competitive total.",2
20 rpo for 20th üòÇ,2
how come bishnoi only bowled 2 today?,3
Can a spinner bowl the last over? Pretty please?,4
Shami is so so so so brain dead. Why the fuck would you bowl short when you're bowling excellent Yorkers,5
More batsmen should have the strategy of hitting short balls rather than ducking. More often than not it‚Äôs going the distance,2
Thats just moronic bowling,5
170 is more than enough for MI to defend against any team.,6
"NCN 23(11)

while Pollard 15(7)

Anything possible against KXIP",6
Punjab management should do Rahul a favor by taking captainship of him. He cannot handle the pressure.Which also demotivates his team.,3
Just how lucky is MI,7
4 sixes incoming,4
why tf do they go short,2
KXIP has the batting line-up to chase anything but they aren't able to  chase anything for the sake of their life.,3
NCN should go to casino after the game ends,3
"Rahul showing a lot more emotion today.... not Koach level, but at least 10% Koach",5
"Not having a proper death bowler really fucks up your team 
 
Glad that we got Bumrah after Malinga",3
Are they seriously gonna get 170 after their top order shat the bed and Hardik got out cheaply? How is anyone supposed to beat them if they can pull that off?,4
"At one point 160 was a distant dream, now it's a reality",2
Jordan should have bowled the 18th over. He will do well this over watch.,2
Shami says I love you to his crush even after rejection every time. Why bowling the same short ball,5
Invaluable cameo here from NCN,6
"I have heard it's expected from bowlers to hit runs in Australia, even in lower grades of cricket. That's why their bowlers can bat pretty well.",8
"Fudge buckets. I hate Mumbai, they're so good batting at death. And who tf has batting til 8 wtf. They're too OP",9
"Are fast bowlers brain-dead or something?

You have just nailed 2 Yorkers and both your attempted bouncers have been smashed for 4.

They why would you bowl another half tracker?",11
MI is just the mid 2000 Australia team.... you get a feeling of hopelessness when you play against them,15
Only 1.4k comments,9
Shami Chose to bowl a bouncer and that's sad,8
Polly is luv,7
*takes popcorn*,6
Pollard attac,7
"End of Jordan

Advance F",4
Mumbai so OP needs a nerf immediately,8
That was a massive hit,6
Why would you not have long off for Pollard?,3
"A crime that pollard is batting only 10 balls in every innings . He should be batting 30 balls
Minimum . He is in a purple patch .",3
How the f they reached 162,4
What shit bouncer to Pollard lol...,4
That 'tkk' was brutal,4
oh shit Jordan is here  Rcb (flash back),4
WTF how did that go all the way,3
This is some brain dead bowling,4
25+ over incoming,2
TARAMANDAL,3
The game has started to favor batsmen a little too much,5
betichod,2
"*~~Aurat~~ Yorker ka chakkar Babu bhaiyya, yorker ka chakkar*

T: Bowl more yorkers ffs!",8
Bouncer to his face ye twat,3
Jordan gonna get hit for 30+ runs,2
180 incoming,6
"bhen ke laude.., yorkers bhool jaate ho kya...",5
WHY DO THEY KEEP BOWLING SHORT YOU ABSOLUTE FRUITCAKES,4
Jordon. Dubai. Last over. What could go wrong,5
Well Kings have ruined it. Yeah keep bowling short.,3
I could hear the noise of the shot even though my TV on mute,3
Air Jordan,3
Pollard reminds me of Stanley. You can‚Äôt remember if they have a mustache or not,2
KL about to cry,4
Fucking nonsense Sunny.,4
kxip have so many options for the last over but all would go for 20+,7
MI team is completely illegal,8
There‚Äôs a reason why KXIP are last on the table,5
I am convinced this bastard was born only to fuck us over. He turns up against us every single time without fail. Fuck off Pollard,11
That was not a bad ball. Pollard bully,5
So will this be last season for Jordan?,5
"Rahul right about now: 'Man, I just wanna go home now'",3
"This hitting by Pollard and NCN just goes on to prove that you don't need any KLs, Virats and Gills to score quickfire runs. Sloggers and finishers are way more valuable than class batsmen.",4
Sanju Sharjah Samson still on top,6
Sunny with his cringey Caribbean accent again..,6
Sunil G again doing the Jamaican accent ....,3
"Pollard is the **best batsman** this IPL. 

Prove me wrong.",2
Sunny sounds so done with the short ball,3
What goes through shami's mind while he sees that batsman cannot hit him for a boundary if he bowls yorker. Almost makes me feel like he wants wickets to get high on board or get those individual awards.,3
I think the only way teams can beat MI is by making them chase. MI too OP to lose batting first,6
can i play the ipl? i can bowl the same,7
KL looks dead inside,13
Mother's Milk is a shit death bowler,21
That shot was like a gun shot. You could hear the echo. Polly kaka is in the mood.,10
Wide yorker?,2
"On every list, KXIP is there in top5 and yet they are at the bottom of points table.",13
"Sunny needs to put away that Jamaican accent for good, it‚Äôs 2020 ffs",11
Get polu back on strike,5
"Pollard running 2s, we've seen everything",21
"Big man. Big strides.

Makes the 2!",5
"KXIP are adamant about somehow using Maxwell for his big pay. Making him bowl full 4 overs now üòÇ

Only he and Shami did full 4 over quota.",12
KXIP exploring new ways to fuck up an excellent start,13
Did I just hear Sunny G with a West Indian accent,15
Why don't NCN and Pollard open for MI?,7
Kya haggu throw bisi,3
"Better throw from maxi and they've got a run out there

Good over so far apart from the first ball tbf",3
Pollard has wasted so many years in these pointless t20 leagues. Seriously needs to make up for the lost time next t20 world cup as captain and player.,13
"Damn, Polly running the second run like a steam engine!",10
"NCN has some good shot making. Didn't know that
.",10
NCN is smart as fuck. Great game awareness.,19
"Cameraman is slowly getting into the groove, match by match. 

He'll be in the groove by next season",15
Pollard good,6
Pollard you beauty,8
170+ is good. Noice.,10
You can never count MI out of the game till the final ball,16
That's it boys Its another cup for Mumbai,8
M U R D E R E D,7
Punjab. Always shitting at the death as usual.,5
"Did they just shout ""daud daud"" while running between the wickets? A West Indian and an Australian",11
"Why does kxip always throw away the game at death? 

Tbf they shud have been sitting at 10 points as of now n comfortably bossing this game as well.",4
The fuckin pitch shakes when polly runs.,7
Fucking sixes at will son. Play this madman higher up,8
NCN saved Australia when they played Windies with his batting in the WC,3
Only people like Gayle and Pollard get their own six counter,9
Fuck thats good,6
You can't compete against a team that bats till number 8,8
omfg is this guy even a human?,6
Please fuck up mi in the mega auction. This team looks legit unbeatable,11
LMAOOOOOO,1
"When he gets back to the dugout, Pollard is going to get a 5 year contract",4
One fielder should be allowed in the stands for Polly :p,3
Pollard you beauty,3
Jordan is always been a quality bowler........................for opposition,5
170+ after a collapse in pp. MI team is killing it.,8
These late runs are going to be a headache in front of Boomrah and company.,2
What a fucking gun team.,5
Please ban this Pollard guy please ban this I have started to imagine what is going to happen with the opponent team :),8
KXIP ü§ù Terrible death over bowling,6
Damn good Partnership 57 off 21 balls. Awesome finish.,6
Shit death bowling,5
Rohit Sharma too lazy to even clap?,8
Holy fuck pollard,3
All you had to do was to ball a damn yorker CJ!,7
Bit harsh to blame the bowler here given how much of a freak Pollard can be,12
"Jordan tried to bowl as wide as possible, still Pollard dragged it to leg side.",5
dEAth OVER sPEciALiST,7
"After hardik's wicket I told ya we'll get to 160, but 176 is kill. Rip k11p",6
How the fuck can a team be this OP. MI should be banned.,13
I'm sorry for doubting you Polly Senpai,8
Is this score enough? I feel we had to get 190,6
This is fuckin insane batting line-up I hate it,11
I'm going to cry the day Polly retires from MI. God he's been such a saviour for Mumbai time and again.,44
20 runs in 20th over. Just KXIP things,4
Mi win by 30+ runs,2
Peak shithousery,6
Pollard is doing what many thought Russell would do,12
Maamaaamiyaaa,3
Lol,2
Pollard is goodüëèüèΩ,3
"I'm convinced if MI finishes top 2, they will get 2 chances to go final so guaranteed finalists and given their record in finals, they aren't gonna do anything wrong. 


In short:  if they finish top 2, MI are probs gonna win.",7
Off topic but why was Jagadeesan dropped after just one match and that too he was run out in it? CSK Batsman.,7
I expected 160 when Krunal and De Kock were batting. What the hell.,8
"From 38-3, i will take this with both hands....... legs, kidney, liver",11
"So, does that mean that KXIP's death bowling is still shit?",5
"Dudes be really crawling at one point and still got to 176

The fuck is this team.?",23
"Pain, man, pain. Fuck you Pollard",7
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU BOWL SHORT??,6
"Brilliant cameos from pollard and ncn

Taken Mumbai to a very good total",5
So he again rescued them....,3
[deleted],8
Death over specialist Jordan everyone lol.,5
C H O K E,2
Man this chase is gonna be hard af. 8 overs of Boult and Bumrah,6
What a partnership though! 57(21)!!!!,4
54 in last 3 overs,3
Fuck me 98 metres is massive,4
Did not expect 176. Gonna be a good match.,3
Punjab batting strong could chase it easy cakewalj,0
Lmao. Sums up KXIPs day,3
Pollard>>>>Russell,12
20 runs given extra.,2
Seriously 54 runs in 3 overs? Great batting,7
"Rohit should be arrested for not letting pollard bat enough balls. 

Man, That man is a real beast.",9
57 runs in 21 balls.,8
[deleted],0
Mumbai Indians is ipl all stars,7
ek toh KL should never keep for India again...,2
176 is more than enough for MI to defend unless KXIP makes miracles which they're capable of. Let's see what happens.,6
Would you rather have AB or Pollard coming at the 15th over mark?,5
Chad Pollard with a batting Average of 204 this season,8
"Ok we have something to ball at now 
Just get mayank out early",7
Polly and ncn batting on a diff pitch and using their luck 100 stat gloves,4
Ban Mumbai. Criminally strong team.,15
"How the fuck did we reach 176.

Polly üòç",12
FFS how does Pollard always saves MI whenever top order fails?,8
People memeing Jordan don‚Äôt remember the dark days of Jade Dernbach,7
"Pollard average watch

‚Äò> 200",4
"85 of 5 last time

54 of 3 this time

Fuck bradman Pollard is the best batsman against kxip",8
"If Rahul went up and said once stop bowling short balls maybe 10 runs could be saved. Fuck this, I hate Pollard so much, fuck off",3
Goddammit so unfair we have to play the eliminator against KKR who are exponentially shittier than us. If MI drop points we might sneak top 2,1
What a come back.,1
batsmen not picking yorkers.. brb let me ball short balls instead.. punjab always finds a way to fk it up at the end lmao,3
Why does Jordon keeps getting games ?,1
Spin was working and Bishnoi did not finish his quota. What is captiancy!,0
How many times Pollard has saved MI's ass single handedly.,11
[Called it sort of??](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jdf9xx/-/g982zbs),2
"If it was any other team, they would get below 160 for sure.",8
Would pay to watch match between Mumbai 11 vs IPL 11,25
Thats our team got 176 with 7th and 8th batting,13
Mahela wanted 160. Pollard delivered 176.,25
Lmao Pollard hates Punjab,12
KXIP players all look look defeated. Doesn't help that they got a good start but MI is just too strong.,12
we should just add 60 to the total after 17 overs when punjabs bowling to save us all some time,12
God damn this MI team just seem impenetrable,20
Please Ambanis retain Polly over Hardik. Just try to buy Hardik for big bucks but don't risk letting Pollard go,13
Should bowl pollard today.,4
"And that's why MI fans are ""arrogant""",8
Preity Zinta didn't respond to Pollard's DM,21
Thank god I‚Äôm not a KXIP fan. Sorry if you are.,7
"Mumbai Indians vs Rest of Ipl.

Make it happen.",11
I am getting excited for MI -RCB MATCH.. Can't watch for ab - bumrah showdown,8
Pollard üëè should üëè be üëè sent üëè ahead üëè of üëè Pandya üëè,14
Pollard is too op.,10
LMAO MI is winning this. This team is literally indestructible.,13
Pollard Wankhede statue when? NOW,22
I have no idea why Jordan is so highly rated as depth bowler,12
"KXIP: Phat Kay haat may aaya.

T: we just had a new one torn .",9
"170+ after a Powerplay collapse. 
This team is just stacked af.",17
"MI scored 54 off the last 3 overs. If SRH is 2 down with 27 to win in 3, it‚Äôs basically even with a slight advantage to the fielding side.",28
Kings 11 could have chased 155-160. This js too much,13
Is this what a middle order feels like?,157
Mumbai winning this will make the rest of league matches boring.,20
"Nothing new, boys. KXIP, as usual, losing it in the last two overs. Ruined the brilliant 18.",22
How on earth did KXIP let MI get to this score after that start and also getting Quinny out at a good time?,22
If I were Mumbai I‚Äôll move pollard up to 4. He‚Äôs too good I feel to only face 10-15 deliveries. Worth trying next game,21
Anyway I think the best bet to win against MI is to chase keeping the fingers crossed than let them chase,10
"you may not see Pollard at the top of the runs table or the wickets table most of the time, but he's made an impact almost every IPL season. a true team player.",109
Punjab really needed Ferguson or Boulty here.,6
I don't know when was the last time Pollard played such innings for WI ? Fucking cunt always comes to save the ass of MI always,8
Pollard and Coulter-nile are such a lifesaver.. i was dancing like a madman ..gg best of luck MI,12
"Pollard after getting all the post match super striker and maximum sixes award prize money,

*Deva, aaj pene ka bandobast ho gaya!*",23
i will never understand how csk was able to beat this team,12
If we go back to 2018 match threads you'll see that everyone was laughing at MI for retaining Pollard.,98
I think Swann has mild memory loss. He keeps saying abd has only come into form in the last three games. I think he forgot the quick 50 that was the difference in literally the first srh game.,10
I cringe whenever a batsman hits a great shot and there is a pun on his name at the big screen,3
God damn! Every time MI makes up the ladder of runs someway or the other,10
"Same old. KL out of his depth on captaincy front

Lets see if we manage to bottle it from a winning position again.",4
"They seriously got 176 after their top order shat the bed AND Hardik got out cheaply. Wow, this team is illegal.",97
Jordan going for 20+ in the death was definitely not a suprise.,14
KXIP needs Gayle special,8
Now I hate MI more than CSK,13
"Always had a belief that if Krunal and De Kock stayed till 11-12 over, 170 was not out of reach. MI were lucky with some edges running for boundaries but boy the death bowling was horrendous.",12
Oh CJ I knew it was too good to be true,8
No chance we win. Fuck off why do I invest so much emotion to this team. Useless wankers,7
Kunal going to get scolded by Jayawardhane for giving out all the strategies in his interview :),16
"> MI batting last five overs vs KXIP:

> Abu Dhabi, 1 Oct: 89/1

> Dubai, 18 Oct: 62/2",13
3 High quality all rounders (Pandya brothers + Pollard). No other team can match this. No wonder Mumbai cruises through most games and often get bailed out even when in trouble.,11
Ambani should just give permanent residence in that big ass tower to Pollard for all his efforts at saving our ass and winning matches from a hopeless position.,15
When was the last time both Pollard and MI's top order failed in a match?,15
Ambanis have made MI great. Can they do the same with Indian football? Just want us to win a football Asia Cup before I die. Still in my late teens so hopefully there is time,17
Hope Rohit gives the ball to Bumrah in the powerplay before Coulter-Nile to get more wickets upfront!,8
"Russell is 1 or 2 season player,

Pollard is evergreen....",55
"When will RR such batting line up? Fucking spend some cash,owner.",9
"Pollard is such an asset. Whenever MI loses early wickets, he is there to save them. Gotta love his life at MI.",14
"Pollard, this season, has S/R >190 and average >200.",9
Wtf I love Coulter Nile now,6
I hope KXIP trade Agarwal for Siraj in next ipl. KXIP needs to bolster bowling and RCB needs to bolster batting,3
Kinda feel like we should just hand that trophy to MI already and call off the rest of the season. I can't see them losing in any situation any more. They're in a class of their own this season.,3
I think close game with MI winning. Rahul will be 60(42) Pooran will make a 40(20). Everyone else will be less than 30.,4
This total is like 220 in front MI bowlers.,10
Still feel kxip will back themselves to chase this down if they get a decent start,1
"In the last game of the season, KL Rahul will say ‚ÄúEnough is enough‚Äù, bring himself on into the attack in the last over and take a double hattrick. And then choke in the chase and lose by 1 run.",14
"I read someone complaining that MI fans are spoilt brats for saying the team is not gonna win because it's an odd year... After this innings, I believe.... We are spoilt brats...",12
MI and RCB threads are the most fun. DC a close second. CSK is sorta fun but ruined more often that not because for some reason they seem to attract retards from all sides show up. RR has the most dead threads.,12
Rohit doesn't have to anything for this team. He can just focus on eating vadapav and his team will win the match for him. Lol.,12
Chris Gayle will get these at a canter.,4
"Fuck fake RCB , Go Mumbai",9
Just realised if opposition gets us 3 down by 15th over then they are actually making things harder for themselves,20
"It wasn't a bad decision to sent krunal considering our top order messed up but he should've tried to hit harder after 11/12th over considering 3 more players, all big hitters could bat.",7
Hmmmm Bishnoi didn't complete his quota...maybe they're waiting for the ball to get old in the second session,10
"Bishnoi bowled only 2, Terrible Captaincy",4
"Pollard average 208 at SR 200

**best batsman** this IPL.",18
"Get mayank out and MI has it. 


Looking forward to some real aggression from KL, hit it hard Rahul, fuck that orange cap.",8
Iirc Pollard was given chances to bat higher up in seasons before but it didn't work out as well as expected that's why he plays down the order,7
Patiently waiting for rcb vs mi so that we thrash the absolute shit out of them,-2
Would have loved to see Bishnoi bowl more,5
"Goddamn Ambani, thats some Terminator shit you got over there.",4
KXIP please you got this guys. Please no MI title again,8
"Pollard had been pretty quiet the last couple of seasons. He hadn't been bad, but blowed hot and cold mostly. He did have the odd match winning innings here and there. This season though he's on another plane altogether.",7
"We finished well, but we can still lose this game. KXIP batting is still too OP: Pooran, Mayank, Gayle, Rahul, Maxwell. Our bowlers need to be at their best, including NCN and Krunal if we have any chance.

Still, if we lose, we will blame Mahela because sending Pollard at 7, when he has been batting so well across the last 3 seasons, responsibly and intelligently, and whenever camera pans at his face, he looks disappointed to not being able to face more than 15-20 balls. Seriously if he faces 30-40 balls, he will easily make 80+. You can send Pollard after 8 overs. To hold him so late is very inefficient.",-1
Sangakkara has excellent eye contact etiquette..,5
They have been using Pollard like this for 10 years. They are not going to change it.,10
Guys any idea whether KL is coming to Australia for the test series?,3
Damn sanga got some hair,4
"Pollard had an unbeaten run in CPL captaining the Trinbago knight riders. He bowled a lot and bowled very well in the CPL as Bravo was not bowling much due to an injury and Narine did not play many matches.

And, now he is setting the IPL on fire. Great year for him.

What a gun player!",17
"This MI team is too OP, almost takes the fun out of all their matches since it‚Äôs so one sided :(",10
More excited to see MI‚Äôs bowling than batting off late. Always a joy to see 3 international class pacers making the ball talk.,5
"Baffling that KXIP is at bottom with such a decent team 
 
Only explanation is KL is a shit captain",4
"> 38/3

MI : oh no!

MI middle order : Anyway.",28
54 runs in last 3. Just Punjab things.,6
Regarding the super over anybody else think getting two wickets should not be the end of the innings?,3
Gayle and Pooran need to fire tonight for Punjab to win.,4
I‚Äôm done with backing Jordan. Get that fuck outta team,1
Half innings over & not even 2k comments today!,6
Gaylestorm needed tonight,4
Gayle is like Zlatan of cricket,9

Fyi Pollard just gets 5.4 cr,47
Bumrah sends one of the openers packing and then we are into the tail,22
"I just checked the forecast and there‚Äôs a huge 
Gayle-Storm incoming, bring out the hard hats",9
Now that punjab is out of the tournament. Can we just watch neesham and gayle play for the 4 matches?,2
How many innings has Pollard been unbeaten for Mumbai?,5
"Let's go King XI, let's show some fight",6
"Top 2 slots in Orange cap race and team at the bottom of the table. 

Death bowling , Rahul's slow innings, No contribution from Maxwell the batsman are hurting KXIP.",9
"Is it just me or are teams able to get 20+ run overs more often these days.

Think a lot of them back themselves to demolish a bowler if they get a foot in",4

Shud i even talk about Maxi?",7

Should Gayle open today?,2

"Polly is great. Krunal getting some time in the middle was good, as he's batted the least out of everyone.",5
"MI Middle order is too damn OP.

Any other team at four down would be grasping at straws, MI still had De Kock batting, with Pandya and Pollard coming to bat at 4 down. -\_-",13
"Whenever MI puts up 170+ on the board, I assume they gonna win no matter what.",9
So can we agree that maybe Koach and others had a point against Kumble?,12
"After batting first, we haven't let any team cross 150

(Except sharjah ofc)",4
"Mumbai management is really goated. Stuck with Polly in 2018 despite all the backlash. Also invested in Pandya bros, bumrah before they became bonafide stars. Even the uncapped Indians are so good and the biggest decision of all might be backing Rohit Sharma as a captain despite his dismal international record before 2013",20
"In the world cup we will have to contend with a Pooran, Hetmyer, Pollard, Russell middle order. Good luck to every other team.",10
What's the maximum number of comments in a T20 match thread.. Any guess,3
I have a feeling Maxwell will destroy us today,5
Is there any statistic that could do Pollard justice for his importance to Mumbai? He always has his moments in a game one way or the other .,3
How do I set my flair,3
How do mi fans find these matches interesting? They are all so one sided with mi always ending up on the winning side,8
"lmao did Mahela accidentally say ""Hi DK"" when (Murali) Karthik started with ""Karthik here"" in [this](https://www.iplt20.com/video/219239/m36-mi-vs-kxip-mahela-jayawardene-interview) interview?",2
KL Rahul should have a great fast paced innings today. He is capable of that but apparently strike rate is overrated. This is T20 ffs.,6
"Can't wait for a classic ""SR is overrated"" innings from KL",3
"Its KXIP's game to lose with top two run scorers this IPL, pooran and Gayle. Will be a fun chase.",3
AB and Pollard are what the commentators portray MS to be this IPL,14
Maxwell will target the smaller boundary and get out while trying his stupid shots.,3
Wtf is that haircut fuccboi?,3
Reminder that KXIP need to chase this in 16.3 overs to reach the 5th place. A normal win would be good enough to get them the 6th place,3
Yo wtf is that haircut of Hardick,5
Wtf is up with pandya's head,6
"Bumrah, Pollard, Rohit, Hardik and Krunal if we manage to get these 5 players through retention and manage to get some of the other players through auction we will still be fine",11
"Poll: Pollard needs to bat at 5, above HP and KP. No matter what situation, he can handle it. He plays percentage cricket. He is facing too few balls. Needs to face at least 25. Yes or no?",7
"Gotta envy MI, an absolute champion team. 3 wickets down in PP and still scores 176",10
Is Hardhit gonna bowl?,3
Hardik pandya the fender bender,3

Indian Aang ?,4
"MI will to trade bumrah for jaydev?

"Rcb has one cheat code



Mi has polly + performing 11(sometimes they don't but it's still good)",6
Why are people saying the bottom 4 are out? Till the time a team does not lose 8 matches they are in with a chance. Even if they lose 8 there is a mathematical possibility.,6
I hope Agarwal does well on the Aussie tour.,7
There is no better situation than this for gayle to open.,9
MI the worst team as far as haircuts are concerned,10
Inb4 KXIP are 160-1 in 15 overs and then they choke and MI win by 1 run,9
Would Agerwal-Gayle as the opening pair work? What do y'all think?,3
MI too OP please Nerf.,7
"Fuck this, I want to see an auction anew. No retentions, RTM's and any other bullshit like that. This MI team is too OP",6
Hardik Pandya looks like a rapper in gully boy,10

Punjab is the worst team in this IPL by far",7
If MI wins this year I will seriously stop watching IPL,6
"Pandya is behaving like a father now.

Now that he is married and has a kid he doesn't care how he looks.",8
"It's criminal that MI got Pollard, Boult, SKY and De Kock combined for less than 15 crore...",24
The day Pollard retires is the happiest day of my life,7
Hardiks haircut made him go from F boy to Priest boy,3
Pollard is so good he can actually play minor league after retiring from cricket maybe a designated hitter,7
"> 119/6

Pollard : anyway, so I started striking.",18
Rohit should bring Bumrah in 2nd over and try to get wickets of any these two..,4
"Glenn maxwell against quality pacers n not so great spinners

Shud be juicy to watch",3
Lol I'm rooting for punjab they deserve to be in top 4. MI has already won too many matches,5
"Hardik becoming more and more like a caribbean.Someone remind him he is from Baroda,not from Barbados.Lol",10
Rohit is right kind of captain for MI. He just chills out in the middle and executes the straight forward plans devised by the coaching team. Doesn't get funky like Kohli or Smith trying to be smart. I remember Sachin handing out a winnable match to CSK on plate in 2010 final by sending Harbhajan at 4  and Pollard at 8.,11
"MI fans: We never said thank you. 
Pollard: And you‚Äôll never have to.",8
Was that clocked at 150.4 or 130.4 kmph?,3

I don't know if KXIP can be written off. They have the best opening pair and an attacking middle order. If they get a good start they are in this. Hope the batsmen turn up today...,10
If you appeal that much you better fuckin review it.,14
[deleted],14
I think Boult's throat is gone.,9
Wtf? There wasn't an edge was there?,6
Oh my god,3
What the fuck kind of appeal was that ?,8
"You are not MSD, Boult.",11
On a side note has El Boulto ever done his famous Flamingo Bat Defense (FBD) ever again? Just saw that on yt. LMAO,3
Mereko nahi aaya,5
"AAAAAHHHHHHH AAAAGGGHHHH AAAAGHHHH

*no review*",12
"Not really convinced about Gayle at 3. His 50 last game was at a relatively low strike rate. Also given that KL has been playing a role of an anchor anyways, it makes sense that KL should come at 3 and let Gayle and Mayank take advantage of the powerplay",9
El Boulto Only thala can change umpires mind.,12
Yeah he's nicked it lmao,6
"I don't think Rohit or QDK heard anything, Rohit appealed after seeing Boult",9
Lol got lucky there,6
ROFL,4
Fuckkkkkk,3
It was out. Shit. Boult was right.,16

Lmao QDK blew that,4

"No noise in the ground and the umpire doesn't hear it, beautiful.",11
After this i wanna see the MI 11th player umpire jokes,10
Dayum dayum dayum. Why keep the reviews if there was that much conviction. Most of these reviews are not getting used in the end anyway,5
He definitely hit that ..... fucking QDK dude clean out your ears.,16
Should have trusted the bowler.,9
What are they preserving DRS for?,20

Gayle at 3 is also going to cost punjab around 15 20 runs in singles and doubles.,3

Hardik Pandya should wear batting Helmet all the time with that deadass hair style.,12

Is kl the game changer for the opposition team?,5

How exactly is kl a game-changer?,6
Dream11 Game Changer of the season  but without AB,4
Nothing‚Äôs going right for us today lol,4

"First 2 overs,  3 missed chances.",3
"This is exactly like yesterday's match , drops and bad fielding. We lost this bois",8
Where was Rahul in the semis?,6
Cracking shot,3
That catch drop and that wrong call from umpire looks like will cost MI,7
"You know the thing I hate the most about the IPL? It's how they judge the Man of the Tournament from a ridiculous fantasy points system where sixes are rewarded more than actual runs and strike rate and the catches are disproportionately rewarded so as to always give a huge advantage to keeper-batsmen. Also, garbage wickets at the end of an innings offer more points than bowling a 6 run final over.",6
Name is Rahul..KL Rahul,5
Love this version of Rahul,6
Considering 4 overs of Krunal and 4 of Bumrah technically opposition team gets only 12 normal overs where they can score runs easily :),4
Intent‚Ñ¢,1
Rahul mate strike rate deos not matter remember,4
Kl threatened after watching Dhawan play yesterday,5
So rahul not agreeing with strike rate is overrated.,2
"I want MI to win, But I'd rather se  a KL Rahul Century",4
What MI does brilliant is trust their players despite shit fielding or bad performances. I feel chahar will make it in national team too.,5
*Look at how they massacred my boy*,2
good intent from KL.. keep it up pls!,1
Feel so bad for Boult,5
I feel cheated seeing KL scoring boundaries and sixes in the Power Play.,8
Holy sh!t man.. KXIP have SOOO much potential.. their team isn't bad.. only if those couple of close matches went their way,11
Do umpire have access to stump mic ? how are they supposed to hear the nick better than keeper and bowler ?,5
"You expected Mayank, but it was me ~~Dio~~ Dhawan",7
Did KL just stop him to go and knock his bat on the crease some more,6
"That's our T20 opener Rahul!!!

It's been too long!!

Get mad, and fuck shit up!! Your team doesn't deserve to be at the bottom!!!",5
KL IS GONE LOKESH DADDY IS BACK,4

First time probably Boult put under the pump in this tournament.,6
"Suddenly all of India's T20 openers back to form, yesterday was Shikki bhai, now KLPD",1
KL in full flow is a treat to watch,3
How stupid RCB should have been to drop Rahul. Yes... We say this every year. Because it's so stupid of us.,6
KL with intent,5
"Dread it, run from it, strike rate arrives all the same.",5
The indian team has so many great openers for T20 now.....going to be difficult to choose,6

Save Bumrah till you start conceding.",11
I see dark clouds around Dubai today. Potential of Gayle storm with KaiL,5
"IPL might fuck up test match game of Mayank. I hope it doesn't, he's a good player and I'm looking forward for him to be a proper opener in test for India for next 10 years.",11
"33 runs on the board, 3.3 overs and at no.3 comes in Jersey no.333",41
Gayle wearing obligatory orange helmet,5
Bumrah too OP,3
Can anyone play bumrah well ?,2
What a lovely pair of balls ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòçü•∞ü•∞üòçüòçü•∞ü•∞,4
"Mayank vs Bumrah in IPL:

Four innings

10 balls

Two runs

Three dismissals

From Cricbuzz",11
Wasn't Gayle supposed to go back home? What happened?,1
Seems like MI is using Jio AI to figure out these batsmen..,8
"Mayank is no mug; India's top opener in Test XI but Bumrah is just too good. His wicket setups are brilliant.

E: Gayle is gonna have a rough time against Jassi here.",6
"MI probably has plan A, B and C ready for gayle.",6
Bumrah and Pollard hate Punjab,9
Pack the slip cordon!,2
I have a bad feeling that Gayle will go from Boom-BOOM Hands,3
Wow what an over from bumrah,3
He can't see it,2
"I love watching Gayle, but I also want us to win. A true Sophie's choice scenario here.",8
Gayle hitting 'X' on his controller,4
Bumrah kar rahe hain Gayle ko Gumrah!,6
"Gayle pushing for a quick single, i have seen everything now",2
"Klr : ""sr is overrated"" is overrated.",5
"This KL Rahul, Uthappa, Mayank Agarwal are on different kind of form when playing against RCB.",2
"My last comment made me curious, so here's a list of the combined cost of 4 good players for each Team this IPL

MI: Pollard+Boult+De Kock+SKY: 14.9 Crore

RCB: Chahal+Sundar+Saini+Padikkal: 12.4 Crore

CSK: Curran+Faf Du+Rayudu+Chahar: 10.1 Crore

DC: Dhawan+Rabada+Tushar+Nortje: 10.1 Crore

KKR: Morgan+Ferguson+Rahul Tripathi+Gill: 9.25 Crore

RR: Buttler+Tewatia+Tyagi+Shreyas Gopal: 8.9 Crore

SRH: Williamson+Bairstow+Sandeep Sharma+Natarajan: 8.6 Crore

KXIP: Pooran+Gayle+Mayank Agarwal+Arshdeep Singh: 7.4 Crore

All of their combined Prices less than any of Dhoni, Cummins, Kohli, Pant.",12
148 damn!,5
Quick single by Gayle. What has this world come to?,7
"This trademark block shot of Gayle. How many times have I seen this as an RCB fan, waiting for Gayle to pop off...",7
"Bring boulty now against gayle, I hope he has no regrets this time",4
MI is like that kid in the school who does his homework diligently and always comes 1st. Took Mayank's wicket and it wont surprise if they did their homework on Universe Boss as well.,5
"There's no way bumrah just gets 7cr, he 100% has some under the table deal with MI",10
"Bumrah is Punjabi , he hates KXIP tho",6
So close to a wicket maiden,5
Getting Gayle out is a mistake.,0
What an over!,1
Gayle taking a quick single!,3
Bumrah is quietly having a superb tournament.,2
boomrah is hax,1
"That defensive shot said ""I am the universe boss, who are you KNAVE ! Kneel before me !""",1
Anyone annoyed with whatfix ad on hotstar??,1
Should give Boult the next over,4
Question is how Rahul changes his approach. Continue with the aggressive?,2
That over was pure class. Love to see bowling at that level. Cant wait to see him in whites in down under series.,3
Sharmaji ka beta should not bring in Krunal and get hammered.,2
Bumrah 148 kphüò≤ his fastest bowl right?,5
Bumrah hitting the right strides before the Aus series. Hopefully he remains fit.,5
"Everyone in MI has had some grooming done. 



Not Bumrah, shaggy hairs, shaggy beard and full on gas. Fucking Rockstar.",9
I will never get over Bumrah in T20 WC Semi 2016 and CT Final 2017,6
"Rohit got bored. He‚Äôs like - Bumrah, end this bullshit.",11
Good to see Bumrah performing well again after the initial few matches of the IPL in which he was not upto the mark.,8
Haha GTFO with that maiden shit,1
NCN has come. Let the run flow begin.,3
"Bumrah showing his class. Only those who don't know cricket could call him ""done"" or ""found out"". Yes, he doesn't bowl yorkers like he used to, but his powerplay bowling is better than anyone else in the world. Truly world's best across all three formats. He is India's bigger superstar than VK.",9
Mayank really looks clueless against Boom Boom,5
Well Left üëè,2
Mi has some sort of plan and Gayle ain't touching such odd balls.,2
This is NOT RCB!!!!! We are MI MI MI!!!,-5
Gayle running a hard single. *_*,3
"Man if boult is released, then RR should buy him. 

My prediction for RR 11 next year 

1. Jos buttler
2. Parthiv Patel/ishaan
3.  Kane Williamson 
4. Dinesh kartik
5. Ben stokes
6. Tewatia
7. R. Ashwin 
8. Jofra
9.  Boult
10. Gopal 
11. Tyagi",-5
"Gayle is a liability at #3. Even more in chasing.

Edit: Well, that was good six.",0
lmao they photoshopped the bat,4
Gayle storm incoming,3
Coulter Nile has a smooth and flowing action.,2
That went FAR,2
Fk gayle storm already struck??,2
Fuckin slap,2
"My God, What a shot",2
That was HUGEEEE,2
"Mayank shaking his head like ""If only I had flexed my thigh, the ball would have gone over the damn stumps""",2
Stepping out. HUGEE!,1
"fuck  
 
Gayle sixes are really something else",3
Damn that Punjab girl is so cuteüòç,7
Absolutely clubbed 99 metres,7
Fuck yeah,2
Gaylestorm here,3
Jesus Christ,3
is it time yet for rahul to play the anchor innings??,1
Fuck. Gayle storm incoming,3
fuck me lmao that was HUUUUGGGEE.. please let this be the start of a gayle 100,5
Im telling you Universe Boss IS BACK,3
I remember those days when Gayle just smashed Brett Lee for 27 runs in an over.,9
Gayle Tonking!,3
The universe comprises of 68% dark energy. Universe boss comprises of 100% big dick energy.,4
Woah he started already,4
Big risk to throw the ball to a rusty NCN right now. Boult needed to go for one more. Need someone who is always targeting the stumps.,7
Gayle Storm is starting. Take shelter NCN.,5
Gayle Rahul at the crease,3
"Gayle using his feet, quite a rare sight",9
Fuck me that is huge,7
Will Gayle play t20 WC?,2
"Did he just say ""a Jamaican can do it better maan"" in a bad Caribbean accent? Ffs",7
Want KXIP to win just because of Gayle :'),7
never retire gayle,3
The Boss has announced his arrival.,3
Do they sanitize the ball if someone from the crowd throws it back?,8
"there is no person in the world I want to see succeed than Chris Gayle, such a great human being",9
Sunny G smacking his lips at the possibility of Gayle or Pooran taking off as he will get to use his Caribbean accent again,7
"Gavaskar needs to stop doing that accent 
 
unfunny and probably disrespectful too",10
"Gayle,Lewis,Pooran,Hetmyer, Russel, Pollard. 


Yup, WI winning t20WC 2021",10
That's a proper Gayle 6. Just the plain authority behind that shot is something else.,4
So hardik was like how can i get some attention when i am not batting well : a weird ass haircut,3
Dessert Gayle Storm is the thing we need to complete the day,5
Sunny G is stuck in the 90s,4
"Gayle looks like a senile old man, but gee his batting is right up there",1
Gavaskar don‚Äôt put yourself in these situations just say normal stuff dude,1
Gayle will hit a six play 6 dot balls.,9
‚ÄúI think it makes sense to try to get Gayle out‚Äù bro what?,10
Coulter-Nile needs a medallion to go with that open shirt and hairy chest.,3
Why is Rahul Tewatia playing instead of KL Rahul? 21(11) what is this attrocity!,5
"Nobody:

Sunny Bhai: YAAA MAAANNNN!!!!",11
"Despite the monster 6, actually a brilliant over by NCN.",11
NCN : ill have some Boom Boom in my over.,5
That is the most un Gayle like leave I have ever seen... Still a legend...,5
I'll take a gayle trademark shot and 5 dots,8
lmao whats with sunny g and jamaican accent?,7
Nice comeback from NCN,5
What a perfect short ball,2
"Beside that one six, i guess it was a good over",8
KL hasn't faced a ball since the wicket.,5
Have the whitehat jr ads stopped? Their CEO agreed that their marketing was not right and he'll try to make it better,11
NGL I'm here just for Gayle.,3
I get that SunnyG is chummy with the golden generation of WI cricketers but his accents might be bordering on appropriation. When he tries to imitate Sir Viv and stuff it's not that bad but he's always itching to use an accent,5
Kxi is already mostly eliminated right ?,2
How to play run a ball without running 101,9
Bumrah should Bowl as long as Gayle is at the crease....keep the spinners away from Gayle,3
Don‚Äôt think anyone wouldn‚Äôt be entertained by a Gayle storm.,5
Jakati stays alive in memes immortalized in ads,5
"Gayle has transformed from 200 strike rate maniac to Matthew Hayden, 120 SR but 90% of his runs will come from boundaries.",2
Why Ganguly is suddenly doing multiple ads is bewildering at best. I guess this is the reward for sucking up to Jay Shah etc.,11
KL storm or Gayle storm,4
"Have we ever seen an IPL team as strong as MI today? CSK 2011 comes close, but still had passengers like Saha, Jakati, and (arguably) Badrinath.",11
"Need Gayle's wicket ASAP, don't want Chahar or Krunal to bowl to him which is likely if he doesn't get out in this over.",11
Sanjay Manjrekar: ‚ÄúGayle in the XI is a huge gamble‚Äù... well what about Maxwell who hasn‚Äôt don‚Äôt piss shit in the last 5 years.,5
Beautiful shot,1
"With Gayle on other side , Kl can't sneak in those singles.",4
"I remember once (20 odd years ago) on commentary a conversation between Sunny bhai and some South African commentator (Robin Jackman?) who referred to Paul Adams as ""Gogga"" - means frog in Afrikaans. Sunny went off on a tangent about Gogia Pasha the great Indian magician lol.. some things just stick in the mind..",6
Man KL is going after Boult.,4
Why is rahul bullying my boi boulty,7
Kayle looks on song tonight,4
Rahul playing with intent is just a different BEAST,6
Wow Rahul showing intent today.,4
KL taking all his frustration and becoming the 2018 beast.,4
Kl giving us 2018-19 throwback.,2
Time for boult revenge on KL,1
From Maxwell starts the tail.,-1
Confident KL is the best KL üòç,5
Who here just watching for Gayle,6
that was sweeeet,7
Gayle KL SHOW Swann is good with puns,3
"Hooks, Cover drives, Ramp shots, KL's got everything in his bag",13
KL Rahul is in another league.. its like hes playing against under 19 team,8
KL has some feud with Boult apparently lol,4
"Is it time to give some rest for boulto, he'll get fresh n fire in playoffs",0
KL: SR is overrated except against MI,4
Gayle surely have scored more than maxwell in 2 ininings,4
I miss they days when it was DLF Maximum instead of this weak unacademy six,7
"Gayle is going to destroy krunal and chahal.
KL looks in supreme touch. Need these two wickets very badly.",6
"sometimes I wish punjab wins just so I can see kl Rahul happy, dude looks tensed always and for pooran ofc",11
"KL Rahul is playing at 192 S/R, picture me surprised. I thought he would play the anchor role while Gayle is on the crease.",10
Does Rahul still have the orange cap?,10
Thanks God KL seems to have given up the anchor role,18
KL making Boult his bitch tonight..,16
Sunny g auditioning for the office or what..clown,5
No need to worry keep hitting Boundaries- Gayle,7
Boulty still thinking about that nick..,13
Lol just no running at all,7
[deleted],7
Hot take: Boult is the weak link of MI.,5
When will Gavaskar stop sucking Rohit's dick...,12
Rahul has looked more cheerful since Gayle has come into the team,11
Uff what a shot!!,9
 Is there a downvoting bot in the sub?,-5
I love how they manage to shade sanju samson every time he's brought up for his sixes lmao,10
Bruh Boult what is you doing,9
Having Gayle here gives KL some freedom to play his natural game‚Äî another reason why he should‚Äôve been in the team from the start,12
Guess most of us gotta swallow our words about KL,5
Gayle showing intent for 2,5
I swear KL Rahul hit that shot with the fastest hands Ive ever seen,9
When it rains it pours for el boulto.,12
"my god gayles inclusion has helped rahul up his sr too, its like a double advantage",6
"Boult's not having a good day, that prob. Means NCN and Bumrah at death?",7
KXIP has decided to just deal in 6s. They just need to pick the 20 right balls out of 84 balls.,20
Boult lost it after that no DRS decision,22
KL and Gayle today: ***Running is overrated***,46
Rohit Sharma invented the pull shot. Case closed.,9
This aint the KL rahul i was promised but i will take that,14
"‚ÄúFriendship over with 2023WC. 2021 T20WC is my new best friend‚Äù - KL Rahul, circa Oct 2020",11
A very strategic timeout ‚úåüèΩ,10
"Bumrah started IPL with 138-142 kph today he clocked 148 kph. And even got the bowl to hold its line to Lefties. NZ tour was horrible for him, Lefties like Latham & Nicholas just guided his 140 kph angled away balls all day. He's gonna meet Warner, Wade and Head in Aus ü§û",15
KL Rahul hogging the strike and protecting gayle for Chahar,8
"Rahul nearly killed me with that strike rate. Almost 200. Please, Rahul, a little warning would be appreciated before such shocks.",11
"In the last eight innings Gayle faced Bumrah, Gayle hasn't hit a single boundary (30 balls)",8
[deleted],5
Very good Powerplay for KXIP,5
My mans trent hasn't been right since that failed appeal earlier,11
"Bring in Bumrah, Get Rahul here and we're through. Let Gayle choke singles for a few overs till pooran gets in pressure and plays a rash shot.",5
Rahul performs well when not under pressure. Punjab gotta find a new captain. Maybe Williamson.,2
"Yo Rahul, couldn't you have smashed Boult like this in the WC SF :(",17
[deleted],7
Gayle has already scored more runs than Maxwell in this IPL.,2
Does dhawal Kulkarni look like a clone of ajinkya rahane?,7
Finally some INTENT by KL,3
SR - *Well Well how the turntables*,3
They are bottom of the table this year but 2014 KXIP is the most dominant IPL team in a season,10
KXIP need to be ahead of the rate considering there are 3 Bumrah overs left.,4
"Don‚Äôt underestimate KL because of his strike rate this season, it‚Äôs obviously because of the shit middle order. He has the fastest 50 in IPL so don‚Äôt shit on his sr either",22
Remembering THAT gayle innings in the first game of 2007 world t20,5
[deleted],-2
"Just Play out Bumrah. With Rahul and Gayle in, everyone else should be attacked.",2
Now dhoni is finishing ads also,1
Boult in tatters after seeing fellow newzie lockie spell today,2
Polly gonna clutch with bowling too?? Lmao,1
Great PP for KXIP in both the innings.,2
"In last 12 balls : 17 runs, 2 6s, 1 4, 1 single, 8 dot balls. Does anybody see the problem here?",1
"WI in T20 is too OP:

Gayle, Simmons, Pooran, Hetmyer, Pollard (c), Russell, Braithvaite, DJ Bravo, Holder, Narine, Cotrell

Extra: Keemo Paul, Alzarri Joseph, Ewin Lewis, Roston Chase, Shai Hope, Bravo jr, Ashley Nurse, KOK Williams,",10
"Pollard op to bowl now, just imagine if he got KL Out",3
Wow Polly? Ok.,1
"Punjab fans, I think your team is winning today",3
They are trying to avoid spinners lol. Too scared of universe boss,4
Gayle vs Pollard,1
KL with confidence is a beautiful sight,2
Do teams just use KXIP now to try out some out of the box captaincy moves?,0
Pollard either gets smashed or gets a wicket,2
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",1
[deleted],-11
Ah yes right arm lazy medium from Pollard...,6
"FFS, stop talking about MSD.",-2
Dammit someone unleashed the downvoting bot,-2
Hardik's head looks like a rice ball lmao,-1
So punjab gonna choke right??,2
Just want to see Gayle hit KP all over the park,1
So they are saving bumrah for last... Not having a good feeling about this.,0
"Apart from that six, gayle scored 1 off 9 balls",-1
"So Pattinson, NCN, and now Boult have had 1 nad game each in the last 3 games. Good to have them before the business end of the tournament. They will come back better. You don't want to peak too early.",1
The Mumbai formula of always Staying ahead the Required Run Rate can work for Punjab,-1
The fact that Chris Gayle might end his IPL career without a title is such a tragedy being the IPL GOAT he is.,5
"Hardik's just discovered ATLA

Trying get that Aang tattoo but with hair",2
Super overs should only be in playoffs and not league stage,-6
"Gayle casually defending balls in T20 like he's a celebrity, which he is. So, can't complain. :)",6
Is Hardik trying to look like a hard dick with that haircut?,2
He does his work but man i hate seeing Pollard bowl.,0
Pollard's always dicking around with Gayle,1
Is kxip doing a reverse 2019?,1
Gayle played like 8 dot balls so far,1
That was just a Single,1
"Gayle gets going if he faces 20 balls, kinda why he‚Äôs an opener you see",-1
There was a 2 bro,-4
That's why Gayle is liability at #3. Can't take 2s. That's a big issue.,-3
Damn just a single. Gayle better make up with sixes,0
Presence of Gayle at non strikers end is making KL Rahul start fireworks from his part too. I hope he doesn't get out. And we're in for a Great KL innings,3
This talkative guy in the dugout seems like a very self indulgent guy,-2
"40 off three overs by Boult is the most conceded by a  bowler in the Powerplay this season.

32(17) is the most scored by  KL Rahul in PP this season.",3
Nice effort there from Boult.,-1
Running between the wickets 0,1
That was just a single? Amazing work by Boult,3
"Seriously what the fuck is wrong with some of you

The second a West Indian player appears, 'variations' of the n word start appearing in comments, tons of BBC comments, every other comment talks about their skin colour

Fucking weirdos",-8
They only ran 1 ffs,-1
Gayle is such a liability man. Hit out or get out. So many 2s and 3s missing.,-8
This is fun to watch,1
"Rohit cant bowl spinners because of Gayle, MI are in trouble now.",6
Fucking 100meters high that one ! Bangg,7
He‚Äôs a legend no doubt but damn does that runup look uncomfortable,5
They didn't take 2!!!,3
"Who is more entertaining to watch, Gayle or AB?",3
Gayle's 6s are a thing of beauty. So much hang time.,5
"Gayle has never been the fastest between the wickets, he has always made up for that so stfu",6
Fffffs,2
Gayle and pooran in the same team is unfair,6
"As someone who lost virginity quite late in life, sex feels more work and less play for me. Is this normal ?",-18
"Saves a boundary, oUtsTaNdInG iN fiELd",-3
My boi Pollard seeing the ball fly away.,3
Lol Gayle just looking for that one bad delivery to tonk and don't want to run at all,8
"Gayle's shots are getting a lot of air time

Feels like it takes an eternity to get back down",16
Old players hate him!,7
And thats why he doesnt run :P,2
Pollard v Gayle gives me all kinda vibes.,3
Better off not taking the 2,0
Everyone will get atleast 1 tonking from Gayle,4
"Tbh the way Gayle plays he doesn't need to run 2s

He has been doing this since the dawn of T20s and he's the most successful T20 batsman in history",10
Xi Jinping sneakily watching cricketüò≥,4
"Kohli: 222222

Gayle: 6....6",123
I mean.. he made Pollard looked like a little dejected boy for a moment there.,2
I'm not sure I want to live in a T20 League world that doesn't have Chris Gayle playing,15
Gayle is absolutely cunting the ball when he wants to smack it,4
Background fake chanting needs to stop!!,0
[deleted],-1
How is Gayle never rusty? Don't think he has played that much cricket. Genuine freak of nature,8
"The length of the six was okay, but the size of that. Dang",3
Baffles me that Gayle isn‚Äôt good with short balls,0
Honestly Dravid shouldn't have done that ad.,-2
Should bring out Bumrah again,1
Hardik on the last step of black conversion therapy,7
Gayle is just too good,-1
Chahar vs Gayle should be cracking !!,4
"Idk why for some people, one six in 6-8 balls makes up for 2s he can't run. I still consider him a liability at #3. Even if he hits 6 sixes in his 40 ball inning.

Edit: He just ran 2. Nice.",-6
Gayle will murder the spinners ffs,1
I don't know if Pollard is trying to pick a fight but surely he wouldn't have done it if it was Virat Kohli. No one should instigate Virat.,3
Here we go spinner now,1
oh boy Chahar to Gayle is going to interesting,4
Why is bumrah being held back? Taking the game deep while the batters build a partnership doesn't do you any good.,-4
Wtf is this gayle ran two!,4
Omg Gayle ran 2,5
"I remember Gayle hitting Rahul Sharma for five sixes , can he do it again with this Rahul",4
"CHRIS GAYLE RAN TWO TWO BALLS IN A ROW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!",5

"Gayle running back-to-back 2s? Well, good luck MI.",9
Gayle runnings twos is worrysome,3
Ohh ffs,2
[deleted],6
Gayle definitely gonna hit you if u make him run so much lmao,4
"They aren't running 2!


And no Gayle don't take quick singles so even with sixes he's still scoring at like 100 strike rate. 


It's the same thing last game, he played so many dots and Rahul HAD to play so many dots because Gayle can't run quickly. 


Hope it's not as bad as last game.",4
Somebody get Gayle an inhaler,4
WARNING WARNING GAYLE IS RUNNING TWOS HE WANTS TO WIN THIS GAME WARNING,11
Gayle running 2s,6
Gayle ran 2,4
Did Gayle pull something there? He was grimacing a lil,-1

I love Christopher Henry Gayle,4
"No one is catching that, Kock",0

"Don't mind these 2s. Gayle is already exhausted.

And a four just as I type this! Lolz",2
That‚Äôs what happens if u make him run double twos lol,12

Nice to see NCN coming into his own. I can't believe Kane Richardson plays ahead of him for Australia. Dorff and him are really unlucky with their fitness. Dorff was destined to be a Test player.,3
Break this partnership and the match swings in favor of MI,8
So this is how they lose.,5
Nikal lavde 2.0,5
I feel like Coulter Nile is the bowler we have to target. Surprised they haven't,0
Bruh both matches today are going to be boring now,3
Why gayle why i said 20 deliveries and you got out on 21st :(,8
Gayle in disbelief. He played his part well,5
No Gayle storm :(,5
LET'S GOOOOOOOOO,4
Yassss,5
Fuck yes,2
Priety is looking like 2000s priety,13
That's why you don't hold back your wicket-taking legspinner,6
I feel for Gayle,3
"KL Rahul will go back to ""SR is very very overrated"" phase again now :(",16
"No Gayle, what have you done",5
There's the match guys.... Gg....see you all next year.,8
Weak sauce.,1
The trap was set for a wide outside off ball...,2
"24(21) and changed 5-6 2s to singles. This ain't gonna work. Make him open.

Edit: Anyways, check my post history. I wasn't criticising Gayle.",9
Atleast he didn't fall to Krunal. That would have spoilt my night.,3
Huge break through by Chahar,1
Yess.,2
"""Pooran's gonna tear Chahar a new one now"" ALERT",2
Now knock out pooran and we r good to go,3
Everything is happening opposite of what Lara is saying,3
See we are not RCB!,2
"**9.1** Chahar to Gayle, OUT,  **75-2**

Wont be surprised with hooda",2
[deleted],-15
whats that about left handers and leg spinners?,2
Gayle Gela Gone.,2
"Rahul Chahar has been such a great performer this season for Mumbai, he's bowling according to the plan and rarely gives out a lossener. I am a bit greedy by saying i want both Pandya Brothers and Chahar Brothers to Play for India",7
They ain't winning,2
Sometimes the universe isn't kind to you even if you're the boss,13
Chahar ma boy üëå,0
"Nobody 

Nehra : bLuE wHaLe cHrIs GaYlE",11
I'm out of here,1
I feel bad for Gayle. And that cute Punjab supporterüòçüò™,4
Was gonna say Gayle is providing stability and he gets out,2
"This match is gonna go deep. 

How deep you ask? Arshdeep.",9
Hopefully kl drops the anchor now,3
All my homies hate Gayle dismissals,5
Gayle ultra pro max walks in now.,4
1 more wicket and into the tail,3
Come on Pooran my man,1

"Last 2 reliable batsman batting for KXIP, 1 more wicket and it's over",2
"Punjab still have Pooran and Maxwell, so decent batting left.",5
Mumbai is not winning this lol.,0
ChunDi Chahar gets Gayle,5
Time for pooran to fucking shine,6
I thought Markanday was good when he got Dhoni and Rayudu out on his IPL debut. He did well in India A matches as well. But Mumbai saw more potential in Rahul. And I did not get the logic but god isn't this bowler almost as good as Chahal for RCB. He doesn't stand out because of our pace battery but Rahul Chahar is fucking awesome.,10
"Weird tactic by MI to bowl legspinner to Gayle. Other teams attack him with bouncer.

Edit: It worked!",6
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",14
Even uncapped players or those with very less experience play like proper players. Ofcourse the team feels invincible,5
Cmon Pooran see this thru,5
"Gayle Played a good Innings, a 21 ball 24 from a Number 3 is okayish considered he also kept Krunal out of Play",7
What was Pollard saying to Chahar?,4
Rahul chahar - Space boss,8
Who‚Äôs this girl you all keep talking about ?,6
Pooran needs to play a sensible innings here and support KL here. Atleast for the next 5 overs. Then he can go for the big shots..,1
Better not leave too much for the end. Won't be easy to score off of Bumrah.,5
Clean shaven Polly reminds me of 2010 IPL when he came into the MI side.,6
Nickypoo pls win this for KXIP,6
"Now MI will choke KXIP with the RR, KL start tonking now target ain't easy.",4
KL needs to stay till the end and need some good hitting from Pooran here,12
Sometimes I feel like Pollard is actual captain of MI. He consults every young bowler alongside Bumrah.,22
Pooran laadddd !,8
Insane power and timing,2
Pooran you beauty,3
Pooran is Lara 2.0 don't @ me. He is the real deal what Shai Hope was supposed to be. Get this guy in the test team already.,10
Called it!,2
"Pooran

Banayega MI ka chooran",6
Atleast now they will rotate the strike more!!,6
"Always amazed at how far Pooran can hit it, considering the size of him.",10
This kid has such feel for the ball.,4
Pooran looks so much like left handed Mayank Agarwal. Even the stands are pretty much same.,6
He hits those sixes so cleanly...,5
Pooran is such a class batsmen,4
Those Punjab girlsüòçüòç,5
"Pooran is the perfect middle order batsman 
 
Takes no time to get going",12
That should have been stopped ig?,1
Those KXIP chicks are fire tho,11
"Last time, Pooran came out to the crease on the last ball and finished the match with a stylish six. I hope he plays well today.",6
Punjab cruising,2
Plz don't bowl spin to pooran,2
Hate me for saying this but Pooran is a better batsman than Gayle.. that Gayle wicket is a blessing in disguise.. I feel like KL was getting frustrated due to lack of strike rotation.,7
Why the fuck is Expo 2020 scheduled on 2021,7
Does CSK still stand a chance to make playoffs?,3
Is running even a thibg in West Indian cricket leagues?,7
"I'm happy with Gayle's innings. 2 down in 10th over with pooran, maxi, Hooda to follow isn't bad at all.",2
Ah Almost,1
KL needs to talk to Pooran throughout to make him keep his cool,5
"Preity Zinta itna maintain kaise rakhti hai. Must have done oil change, timing belt replacement, transmission lube change etc. all on time throughout life.",1
This is such a good batting lineup,2
"I hate seeing rich people happy. Mask off, watching an Ipl game in dubai, no college homework",13
Preity Zinta has brought in all her cousins to distract the opposition.,26
"With all these sixes, who is going after the ball and bringing it back into the stadia?",6
[deleted],12
Close,2
"Why is MI a group of smug, unlikable people",-5
"Pooran vs polly

Gonna be fun",3
"Wait, did Aamir get a facial surgery? How does he look 20 years younger all of a sudden?",7
Pollard was away or it'd be out,1
It feels like even Maxwell will come back to form today if he gets his chance.,8
Pooran is everything Ishan Kishan hopes to be,12
Pooran winning it,1
KL almost screwed by playing that shot to Polly,5
It was indeed a big over. Half points to Lara.,3
Jordan key tonite?,2
"that is not change up, Pollard average speed is 125 odd lol",8
Hardik lost a bet and ended up like that,4
"Rahul is like the wall, he doesn't look like he's getting out only

Also SR is overrated",4
"Sure Gayle should take his time but not like this, if you‚Äôre gonna take up that many balls to destroy rhythm and only give a run for each you‚Äôre better off scoring a quick 20 of a few and going back",2
"Man, please hardhik wear a cap",7
"Pooran,  give belte belt to krunal pandya. Thik hai.",5
"Punjab has got such good players ,only thing lacking is a proper management. Could have aimed at the cup even..",2
KXIP are the worst opponent for top 4 sides to face. Can kill absolutely anyone now,4
How is KL one of the most valuable player? Simply scoring meaningless runs doesn't make anyone valuable.,8
"Again the usual script guys 

They are going to stretch to the last over",5
"In general, I think there's been a real shortage of quality right-arm offspin. Legspinners can bowl googlies or wide deliveries to left handers but its not the same as the accuracy as variations in trajectory as a good offspin bowler.

Edit: There's just R Ashwin and Washington Sundar (who doesn't exactly rely on much turn).",1
"Rr has 2 players in top 5 MVP list, yet at the bottom four",2
87 off 57 is very doable.. that is... If it wasn't KXIP batting.,11
PollardüòÇ,3
Why is hardik tryna look like aang?,3
"hahaha, MI at the top of fair play table.",5
WTF is that hairstyle of Hardik,5
Dang preity still got it,10
Should the fake ball even be legal.?,5
They need to penalise for that. So fucking annoying,4
Pollard looking like a Bengali uncle from that angle,4
Can see KXIP fucking this up,1
Pandya is the last airbender,7
I hate Pollard when he does this,3
Pooran-Polly!,8
Pollard is like father figure for pooran.,2
Wow,3
This is the reason KL slows down so much in the middle overs. Barely any support from middle order. No major lower order hitters to come.,5
How is mumbai at the top of fair play with pollard pulling this bs every game,2
Poooran ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,4
What a player,3
"My goodness what has Hardik done to his head, I'm noticing it only now",6
Pooran looks absolute class when he drives,6
Banger trying to do a Swanny with Altroz,3
"Polly seems so annoying

Bring in starcy next ipl",2
Bumrah needed now,2
"If I want to watch cricket I will watch Pooran bat, if I want to watch baseball I will watch Gayle bat.",2
2000s we had Rahul Dravid as the wall.. 2020 we have KL Rahul,2
"Am i the only one annoyed by thefake crowd sounds , smh rather listen to the dug out quitely peacefully..",3
Pooran will save this match!,1
"I feel like Pollard's fakeout when he sees that batsman moving should be illegal. It's a conscious, voluntary decision, it doesn't sit right",6
Rohit has an IPL hat-trick. Why doesn't he bowl Rohit to the left handed?,6
horizontal bat cover drives are so easy on the eye,3
Why is krunal not bowling,2
"I forgot with gayle, kxip has 4 batsman",4
"KL & Pooran can tuktuk + fours their way to win from here, but it's KXIP, so they are gonna get out hitting sixes.",11
Pooran is Gayle who can also run,19
Yea staph now polli,3
"Looks like KXIP will get to victory smoothly, unless Bumrah has some other ideas.",6
Hardik Pandya more like Hardik Pandit,7
Who's the white guy with glasses in Punjab's camp?,3
Get bumrah in,0
Thank you Polly kaka. Very cool.,7
The only way Rohit could have grabbed it is if he imagined it to be a varapav.,2
That's the way pooran..... All hope on you!!!,3
Bumrah is coming next,3
Get fucked Pollard,5
Plastic surgery waale Aamir Khan will now be making a film on impacts of lookism on the society. Please watch the movie to take a stand against this social evil.,5
Pooran on fire! Letss go !!,5
will a punjab win mess up the race for the 4th place? damn pooran looks in supreme touch,4
Fuckin beuat,1
I hate it when Pollard stops during run-up.,5
"Pooran is so so good

Brought the rate back under control",4
Wish I was there in the stadium waving those flags with themüòäüòç,4
they've bowled only one over of bumrah.. need to account for his 3 overs in the RRR,1
What a player this Pooran lad is.. 10/10!!!!!,6
"Pooran giving no fucks whatsoever, love it",3
Pollard deserves to be taken to cleaners just for that lazy bowling action of his. Looks like the guy who is bowling just for the sake of it without putting any effort whatsoever.,3
Just see through Bumrah‚Äôs overs pls,2
That was beautiful. Pooran is fiiiire.,5
"For those that don‚Äôt know, Pollard is a father like figure for Pooran. He‚Äôs mentored him since he entered the Trinidad scene as a 16 year old and is one of the main reasons how Pooran bounced back from that horrific injury. Good to see pollard bowling to him",17
Nick. Smash,1
Pooran paces his inning so well in middle overs,2
"We only beat top 4 teams - KXIP, probably",11
Cameramen doing the best fan service,7
Pooran is just wow,3
"Pooran, you pure class, man what a talent",5
"Bangar, don't even try. Altroz is Swanny's baby",6
Pooran is INTENT personified.,6
"Pooran should maintain this hitting, not expecting much from Mr. Strike rate is overrated",1
Really satisfying and therapeutic to see Pollard getting hammered.,13
Kandha √±anum varaa time again üòÉ,-3
KL looking dead inside even while dancing,3
That's really some clean hitting. MI get bumrah this over,2
Who is that big fatty spinner and why his run up is big?,5
Need to bring back all the firepower rn,1
pooran may be the most fun player to watch this tournament,7
Gg kxip. Don't see mi winning this anymore,3
Pollard giving back the runs he scored,7
Only one gear for Pooran - top gear :),6
Pooran you beautiful bastard,3
"Pooran and Pant are very similar players but dang, Nicky P is just so fckn pretty to watch",4
Boom boom will come back and blow another off stump. Standard stuff,3
Pooran you fucking classy majestic beautiful mini beast,2
"ALTROZ. Only way for it go off the stadium was Gayle smashing a SIX and shattering its windows. They wouldnt have left the car with a broken windows, bad publicity.",1
It was about time someone started tonking Pollard's dibblie-dobblies,3
"Pollard to Pooran: Dei. Naan un annan da.


T: I am your brother mate.",7
Anyone getting igp Diwali ads? On hotstar?,2
Polli kaka deserved to be cunted that over,1
Bruh atleast punjab providing us with some quality content if not winning..,2
Want Kohli to bowl to Pooran.,7
"However cringe they are, the kingfisher ads are one thing that shouldn‚Äôt go away from ipl",7
Pooran is the next big thing,7
Kings XI transformed into Suicide Squad XI...,4
"Pooran is one of the cleanest six hitter, in the same league of Pollard.",3
That Batspeed is op.,2
Should have given this to Bumrah,2
"Stop simping ffs, we have to beat Mumbai",4
Is that the 20th six for Pooran?,2
Pollard economy is still decent for the filth that he bowls.,3
I feel like Punjab will again be like we just needed 40 in last 5 still couldn't get it. With 3 overs of Bumrah and 2 of NCN,6
Man this batting lineup of KXIP we were all excited about start of this tournament. Sweet as.,4
Pooran is a beast,1
Haven't followed Polly's bowling in recent years but wtf is this limping Malinga lite‚Ñ¢ action?,3
Bumrah needed,1
Who are those hotties of KXIP?,5
Pushing our luck with Chahar. Let's see how it goes.,1
I haven't loved a cricketer as much as pooran in a while omg,6
Who is he saving Bumrah for?!?,1
Rahul goes for rahul,2
I don‚Äôt feel so good Mr Mahela,6
Those damn chicks!,2
I am sure KL  is going to fuck up now going into a shell and play dots because Pooran is striking at 300 at the other end.,4
Pooran cunted Abdul for 28,2
"KXIP:

KL

KL lite

Gayle

Gayle lite

Half season wonder

Rest doesn't matter",11
KL adjusting his Strike Rate,-2
Hardik's hair makes me wonder Am I watching a Football match?,3
Rahul no tuk tuk plz,0
KL leaving a ball in T20 lmao,1
Kl trying to maintain his Strike rate. Go Rahul..,2
Keep going Pooran. There's a bunch of Bumrah to come and I only see KL taking him on. Get most of those runs out the way now,3
R Chahar looks like desi VVD,4
73(50) doable for every team except KXIP,11
KL can change gears so fast,7
"Forgot how young Chahar is.

It's probably the cut.",7
IMO KXIP should target 25 runs of Bumrah's remaining 3 overs without losing a wicket & the game is theirs.,2
"Okay, who dafuq stopped those vada pav supplies to mah boi brohit. Looks like he lost weight",3
Wish India had more players like Pooran. Electrifying to watch.,8
Did dekock say ayyo?,9
Why do I feel like KL gonna fuck up again,8
This is good from Punjab. Get runs now while Boomrah is not on.,2
Anyone has a good pic of hardik today?,2
Bishnoi has one of the best googly among indian legspinners,8
"Just 3 off Chahar, Brilliant",4
"If Chahal wasn't there, Rahul Chahar would definitely be India's best leggie.",5
Bishnoi‚Äôs legs look like |,5
"Get pooran out, he won't take it to last over",2
Only 3 off that over lul,3
No need to go cheeky Pooran. You are good naturally,2
Once Boomrah is on getting 6 RPO will be monumental task.,2
"Rahul in first 16 balls- 31(16)
In next 16 balls- 12(16)
The Rahul we know is back.",5
Please give Bumrah the next over,1
so so good to have Sanga in the comms,5
Where do you guys think Rohit goes for his vada pav fix when in Mumbai,2
"[The social media reach of Kohli is simply astonishing](https://i.imgur.com/nuDOmhu.jpg)

Edit : this was on Facebook. Looks like Instagram reach is so much more",6
72 of 42 quite easy to chase if both persists. Just don't go slow.,3
Why do I feel like KL is going to statpad again and lose this?,1
Who wins,1
Chahar is definitely international material. How's his batting?,1
Lets not give a wicket to Bumrah . This over can be gamechanging,4
Am I the only one who thinks MI players are getting bit cocky..?,0

This guy Rahul Chahar looks like he's from Jamaica or some place from his hair style!,3
Set up perfectly for kl to anchor while pooran finishes the innings,5
O boy.... Here we go.,3
"Why krunal is not bowling, is he injured?",3
That middle over KL is back. Advantage Mumbai,-1
Bruh gayle looking like some king in a south movie lmao,8
Oh here is the crucial over. Bumrah is here. Anything can happen now.,2
Rahul play's bumrah so well,2
"KL Rahul with Mayank & Gayle: 37(24)

KL Rahul after Mayank & Gayle: 6(8)",8
Pooran is actually the combination of Lara's elegance and Gayle's strike power.,10
Gayle can have an even bigger and colourful career if he tours India as some gyaan giving baba.,9
Wanna see rahul taking on Boom Boom,2
This dude just gave 3 runs wtf,7
"Lot going on with Hair today, afternoon as well as night",3
Phew,1
"KL plays Bumrah really well  
 
What MI need is Pooran's wicket",9
KL Rahul only uses Anchor electric appliances and Anchor toothpaste. His yacht doesn't have an Anchor though as he anchors it himself.,8
"Shield Pooran from Bumrah, Rahul. The game depends on it",11
"I love WI players, Give me 4 of them in KXIP",2
"If they score off Bumrah, they win.",8
Rahul needs to realize this shitty responsible approach is gonna hurt the team. Going berserk is his responsibility now tbh,4
Harish yadav isn‚Äôt as excited as the rest,2
"2 down and this is already the last proper batting pair they have. 


Just KXIP things!!!",10

Mah man!!,2
Bumrah best since Bradman,6
Pooran displaying Samson level awareness,16
Fuck yes,7
Welp game over,5
You play cautiously against Bumrah and not even looking to get a single and then you are forced to play stupid shots.,15

"Oh Pooran Pooran, Lawda Lasan ho gaya :(",6
Man MI have always have some sort of plan with BOOM- BOOM,6
Pooran really needs to chill and understand his role in the team. Seems like this is where KL's inexperience as a captain is showing,5
I'm heartbroken üò≠üò≠,1
I hate MI lol,5
"*Nikal lawde*

Boom boom üí™,2
And that's exactly why KL plays the way he does. Someone has to stay to keep the momentum up,3
Why is everyone wearing those bands on arms?,2
Has anyone noticed Bumrah's no ball count has significantly gone down?,5
So basically Rohit just has to decide when he wants a wicket,14
Bumrah the giant slayer.,6
Forget yorkers Bumrah's short balls are fire,5
yeah this is not looking good,2
Now Kl stays till the end just to see his team choke this properly yet again.,9
Bumrah so good,3
Ideal game for Maxwell to step up today,7
Nikal Lawde!üòÇ,0

Preity is so pretty üòç,4
Pretty Zinta and Chahar have the same hair stylist,6
"Fuck ABD and Koach bromance, me and my homies like KL and Mayank bromance",4
"This was such a winnable game, then Pooran changes the whole tide of the game. So disappointed as a WI fan",2
"KL has to finish this game. Nice,composed fifty",5
"Something about West Indian batsmen batting well only to get out to a clear plan, mostly holing out to the exact place where the fielder had been placed. That's why they fail to win the clutch moments.",3
And KL finishes his mandatory Fifty,8
Ffs chahar,3
"Jesus Christ

KL Rahul's in sublime form this IPL too.",9
"All those people saying game over, K LRAHUL IS STILL THERE! Calm your tits/chest/pectoral muscles plz!",5
"What are we thinking, 'Big Show' or 'No Show' today?",5
Jabardast Rahul,2
"Just 3 wickects down and all you have remaining is out of form Maxwell, Hooda and Jordan?

No wonder KXIP is at the bottom and KL has to play cautiously.",11
"Bumrah is saving runs for all other bowlers, and all other bowlers are giving freebies.",5
how many 50s bro,3
Mr Stark i dont feel so Max-well,2
"We r just hyping it up

Rahul can chase this down alone from here.. 

Unless they choke again",2
Oh my fucking god.,1
KL has been consistent af. Wtf Maxwell,5
Maxwell duck lol,2
Lmao Just KXIP things,1
Preity looking like a snack there,3
Abey chutiye,4
I have no faith in Maxwell.,3
LMAO,2
Maxlol,3
As expected from Maxwell.,3
Oh my slip fielder of team India,6
Come on lads! Get in!,2
Shitwell,3
"Maxwell playing as expected, atleast one normal thing about 2020 is Maxwell ipl form",7
Lmao.. Maxwell is absolutely brain-dead..,4
Rohit you beauty do beautiful captaincy,2
Hahaha fuckoff Maxi,2
LMAO atleast maxwell not wasting any balls,3
BC Maxwell tu kisi kaam ka nhi h,2
Just release Maxwell already,2
Lol .. that is what I can say.,1
"Phew thank God Bumrah took a wicket. When Rahul scored three off him, I was starting to get worried he might not end up with test match economy",2
Oh no KXIP are bottling this aren't they,3
LOL Maxwell.,2
"Wtf? KL Rahul already has 500 for the season

Lmao Maxwell

Good catch from vada pav",6
"The imposter called Maxi.

He's having a torrid time (not that he ever had a good time in IPL barring a season).",5
MINWELL,5
Absolutly brilliant delivery,3
What a catch though,3
Dafuq,2
Nikal Lavde 4.0,6
"this is Maxwell's last chance

Everyone since last 2 years",12
Rahul might end up with orange cap while playing 3 matches less than others,7
 duck for Maxi lol 8D chess from Rohit,5
"* Mayank
* KL Aahul
* Gayle
* Pooran
* Maxwell
* Hooda
* Jordon

What a batting line up.",6
Please drop Maxwell for Neesham pls. He has had enough chances now.,9
That's how he catches Vada Pav in his local shop,10
Wrong move by MI. Maxwell could've wasted another 5-6 balls.,6
Surely Maxwell is not gonna get a IPL bid next season.,12
I've nothing to say about Maxwell.........,9
Maxwell pog,7
Maxwell back to useless,5
Goddammit Maxwell,4
LMFAO MAXI HAHAHAHA,4
Fucking Maxi,3
Maxwell doing a Maxwell üòë,4
Just rotate lmao,1
That's a great catch,1
Maxwell RIP,1
Maxlel,2
Hahahahaha,3
Maxwell on suicide watch,4
"As expected, well done Maxwell.",4
Maxwell you fuckin fraud !!,4
Chahar - Mumbai's Chahal!!,3
Our expectations for you were low but holy fuck,6
The flop show is back again. THE most overrated cricketer in IPL history.,7
Maxwell is paid just to show up at IPL,2
"Maxwell has to be dropped now. Holy shit, he has been utter trash.",5
Why is maxwell not playing well? üò§,2
I mean that's just brilliant captaincy,5
Maxwell should retire from ipl,2
S H I T,3
Make Rohit the captain of the Indian team ffs please.,6
"Lmao I can‚Äôt evenüòÇGuys what is happening? Punjab fans, why do u like choking so much? Why in the world whyyyyy?",2
Maxwell is as useless as jadhav.,12
Time to drop maxy,5
It's just funny from now on,3
Lol this fraud again.,3
Sharma with a drunkard's tumble. Was that an attempted dance?,5
"*I have a different role* 

*I'm not getting enough chances to play* 

*I'm a bowler now*",4
Maxwell is undoubtedly a walking wicket.,2
"Looks like it was 'No Show', big surprise!",2
Drop this cunt,1
Maxwell is so shit in the IPL,1
Maxwell's batting has been beyond useless,2
Fuck protein powder!! Vadapav is the real thing,7
Literally said to myself a minute ago ‚Äúmaxi needs to chill and it‚Äôs possible‚Äù xd,1
Maxwell useless as usual,2
Maxwell and his shitty stance can go back,2
Maxwell jeez what was that,1
Kxip again throwing away the match,2
lmao this isn't even funny anymore. this is just sad,1
Maxwell or Min-not-so-well,2
I just hope kl cracks under pressure,1
Sometimes I don't know why..... I just feel really sad for Maxwell this IPL....,2
Lmao just end the game,2
What the fuck is seriously wrong with this team,2
The walk of Shame,2
That slip was in place because of Maxwell's batting angle,2
I was hoping to see Maxwell redemption today.. guess not,1
Maxwell is not worth a dime to this team. They should have played Puran instead of him.,1
I'm both not surprised and still hurt :(,4
This is very good captaincy from Rohit,1
i feel so bad for maxwell poor guy,5
Why don't they play Neesham ahead of Maxwell?,2
Maxwell in the team for his economical 4 overs lol,2
Bohot hard maxi bohot hard,3
"We are just too good at producing batsmen, but producing world's best bowler makes Bumrah the greatest Indian player since Sachin, because of how rare he is. He will take at least 700-800 international wickets across formats.",4
Fun fact: Deepak Hooda was a part of the Indian squad for the Nidahas Trophy.,4
No wonder KL plays so conservatively- the batting order is this unreliable.,11
I don't even know what to say about this Maxwell dude,5
Taxi,2
Just need to get kl now,4
Maxwell back to the dressing room in time for some instant noodles,8
Same old. Same old.,7
What the hell is wrong with Maxwell. All he had to do was rotate strike.,3
"**13.3** Chahar to Maxwell, OUT, slip takes out Maxwell **115-4**

GJ Maxwell c Sharma b Chahar 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
Shit gets wickets,0
Bro I cant event üò≠,1
Brilliant from Rohit keeping himself at the slip! Was a good catch as well. Very smart,5
Yep that's it for the proper batsmen of KXIP.,2
Some one needs to go out there and read KL Invictus,1
KXIP channeling inner RCB,1
Maxwell at 11 next game. Kings xi‚Äôs new front line spinner,5
Imagine having a batting line up as deep as MI,3
this was just very irresponsible from Maxi,3
He‚Äôs more useless than Jadhav. Jadhav‚Äôs play style would‚Äôve been well suited here. I was criticising Shreyas for being tuk tuk but this makes me appreciate him for not being a dumbass.,10
Good thing for KXIP is that Hooda is pretty good against spinners,1
"Told you guys just watch last 4 overs 

Anyways they are going to stretch it to last over lmao",1
Not his fault imo. He is a bowler.,3
Fuck off! Play Stuart Binny instead of Maxi for all I care. This was a piss off job üòî,2
Tremendous captaincy! Slip first up to Maxi was a brilliant decision.,4
"Teams supporting Punjab: DC, RCB

Teams supporting Mumbai: RR, CSK, SRH, KKR",5
Punjab doesn't want to win I guess. We'll happily take it thanks!,3
"Happy for the wicket..

But feel for Maxy :(",2
"My expectations were low, But wtf KXIP ?",3
Deepak Hooda giving SRH 2018 chase vibes,4
Incredible reflexes to make that catch. Announcers not giving enough credit to Sharma.,9
Can never trust Maxwell to be responsible.,3
"Maxwell, Kedar, Vijay Shankar, these guys are there just to bring a boatload of bad luck on their teams.",12
How many million next mega auction for Maxwell?,11
"Maxwell just had to play out the leg spinner

But no i ll go after him the first ball i face 


Same with pooran n bumrah",7
Looks like KXIP winning campaign is at end with no RCB matches remaining,6
Maxwell has anyway turned to a full time bowler for KXIP right?,6
"Solid Defense from hooda, keep it up",1
Maxwell is literally a waste of space in IPL. Never really understood the hype around him in the first place. My dead nan has better decision making than him..,11
Maxwell wants to finish binge watching Jane the virgin,5
The commentators got it all wrong. Maxi is a walking wicket. KXIP now use his wicket a false sense of advantage for the opponents.,3
KL might make a miracle and carry this to win.,3
Maxwell has been incredibly consistent for Punjab this season! ü§£ü§£,10
maxwell be like pehli phursat main nikal,3
"After tiktok ban, companies really trying to capatalise their market, first josh and now insta reels",9
Hooda never played one fucking good innings for SRH.,20
They can still win if hooda stays with rahul,3
If KXIP lose put KL on suicide watch,11
No wonder Rahul bats like his team is going to lose if he gets out,12
Never change Maxwell (I don't think he can lol),5
Wtf Maxwell,4
Can't wait to see maxi tonking us in December January in Australia,7
"Punjab: No brain, just vibes",5
KL doesn‚Äôt deserve this team man,10
That was some catch by hitman!!!,9
See Maxwell rip apart everyone in T20 world cup and then again go for million dollar bid then disappoint in ipl and again cycle continues,11
KL = Alright fine i'l do this myself again,5
"KL be like fuck this team, I am getting that orange cap after team not performing",7
Gotto feel for Rahul here.,3
Pooran plays for his ego. He takes on elite bowlers when he's close to seeing them out cause he wants to play shots. Did vs Rashid in the Sunrise game and again vs Bumrah tonight,8
KL's tuk tuk is totally justified. No other middle order shits the bed like this everytime.,7
Maxy please fuk off,7
Maxwell is the kind of guy who would fall for Nigerian prince scams. That dismissal was a setup one could see from a mile away,6
Bruh maxi didn‚Äôt even last my piss break,3
Rohit Sharmas wife: Caught my bae slippin,4
big no show,5
Maxwell is an Australian Sanju Samson. Completely useless.,7
Lmao Maxwell has been a walking wicket this season,8
There's something about Rohit Sharma as a captain. He's just the element for a captain,7
Poor kale Rahul. He's gotta do the job himself most games,4
Man Rohit is so smart tactically,8
I finally understand strike rate overrated. KL ahead of us. Sorry KL,9
"Our auction was super lucky, we were going hard for Maxi and Cummins ended with up Stoinis and Woakes. Best possible way it went (Nortje replaced Woakes)",10
"To the guys saying, KL was playing for orange cap, you get it now? He mis-manages the R/R for sure, but for orange cap? Naah. Middle order doesn't exist.",26
I had no hopes but I am still disapppointed,8
Deepak hooda? Is it 2015.,5
Dammit! MI always have their shit together!,4
[deleted],2
I feel Chahar is more consistent than Bishnoi.,6
Maxwell slowly becoming reverse Steve Smith,5
"60 off last 6 with 2 boom overs, I'm liking the odds",6
Bring back Neesham,5
KL under a lot of pressure!!! Hope he sees his team through!!,6
"Pooran, Gayle, Maxwell all getting out to stupid shots",5
No team should ever buy Maxwell again,3
Punjab need to play Karun Nair who can bat long innings around these power hitters.,3
"As much as I like Maxwell, this has to be his last game surely. Playing a shot like that after a six from the first of the over was so unnecessary, just take a bit of time",5
"At this point, i genuinely feel sorry for Maxi. He just doesn't seem in the right headspace.",5
Imagine now maxi coming out to face chahal for that 1 of 1,3
MI family in Bangalore? Sending my area boys rn.,1
KXIP sucks,1
"All you strike rate warriors, this is why KL plays so cautiously. This middle order isn't dependable for even one match. KL has had to carry the bat for both the matches that KXIP has won. Poor guy still gets criticism for strike rate and playing for the orange cap.",17
Maxwell only here for vacation and to collect cheques,6
Do we have someone to play instead of Maxwell except for Neesham at no. 5?,2
"Rohit has a great team, but he is an equally great captain. He is defending a below par score against probably the best batting team this season with one of his main bowlers having their worst game, and yet he is managing his troops and staying in the game through his astute leadership. He should be India's T20 captain if not for ODIs.",13
5 full time bowlers is way too much. This is awful team planning. Just am absolute wreck all around.,1
They need 60 in 4 overs,1
Maxwell won't be dropped anytime soon so make him bat at 11 from next game.,6
Wicket incoming,1
Wide Yorker time,1
Tail starts,1
"MI , pls win",2
"Gareth Southgate playing Mount instead of Grealish.
Kumble playing Maxwell instead of Neesham. 
Nice Co-incidence",3
Cricket is such a funny game. Only few months back Maxi could do no wrong and now this. Feels bad man.,1
We can all shit on Maxwell now but he will still go for 8+ Cr in the next auction. The guy indulges in some black magic on the day of auction.,13
"Seems like, ever since multiple choking incidents, Kings XI have decided to take Bang Bang approach to run chases.",1
"With the amount of pressure KL is being put under time and time again, with amazing shot selection,I don't blame him for playing over cautiously.",8
"At some point brain dead batting like this by Maxwell needs to be punished by not selecting him in the squad, never mind the XI.

It's a shame really. Maxwell hasn't lived up to what many us wished for him.

E: This is n the context of IPL teams.",8
60 of 36 should be easy pesy,5
KXIP is more RCB this season than RCB has,3
KL has been terrific,5
How did we lose 2 times to these chokers?,3
KXIP: The art of loosing,4
That Josh ad with girl holding umbrella is next level double meaning.,8
"Rahul Chahar's performance in the playoffs last year was so good

4-0-14-2 in the Qualifier

4-0-14-1 in the Final",8
"In 2018 I was surprised when markande was picked over chahar, he was really readible after a few games, now chahar for the win",2
"fuck winning the ipl, beating mi should now be a measure of how good a team is",6
Why MI ALWAYS gotta have plot armor?!,4
Pritey's money laundering scheme : Maxwell,8
I think Chahal has exposed Maxwell's weakness,2
Imagine two super over games in one day,2
Neesham deserves his chance fam,2
"When I die I want Glenn Maxwell to lower me to the grave, so that he can let me down one last time.",9
Somebody please tell me Hooda can bat. Or bat atlest better than Maxwell,2
Please don't have a closeup on Hardik's head.,-1
This team doesn't deserve Rahul.,6
"Maxwell is the Ozil of KXIP, except even in the past he wasn't world class and KXIP has no option but to play him",1
[deleted],2
41 year old Gayle who has been benched for Maxwell for half the season has more runs in 2 innings than Maxwell has in the whole tournament,12
The more I see Pandya's hair the more I hate.,6
KXIP just need to accept Maxwell will never be as good in IPL as he is in internationals. They need to let him go,8
I don't like having Rahul around. Someone get him soon.,1
IPL Maxwell is actually trash,5
Who do you feel sad for this IPL so far? KL Rahul for KXIP being the contender for Orange cap in the team lowest on the points table or Sam Curran being the boi in camp CSK? Or someone else?,3
"Rahul playing dots, go for it champ",1
KXI Punjab is like Venezuela. Lots of resources but nothing to show for it.,7
The only way KXIP can win this is for Rahul to get 50 off the 60 runs needed.,3
Want KXIP to reach playoff but not in expense of our loss.,2
"KL the lone warrior stands midst wolves, Punjab is opposite team they are like whole pack dies and KL survival, GOT Reference",3
"Not even gonna shit on Maxwell. He's got mental health issues. We in this together, brother, even with you being rich",7
"Fun fact: Deepak Hooda is nicknamed ""Hurricane"" because of how quickly he can turn around games.",7
Maxwell is in the team for his bowling,3
Kings shoul play neesham over maxi,2
I love both KL Rahul and KXIP but KL deserves a better team.,9
"KXIP HR (circa 2014): Where do you want to be five years from now. 

Maxwell: I'd like to collect the paycheck of a manager with the output of an intern. 

KXIP HR: Salary kitna loge, decide karle?

(T: Should we begin with salary negotiations?)",10
"Hooda was shit for SRH‚Äôs bad middle order a couple years ago, idk if he‚Äôs improved",5
This part of the game where MI really good at. Past 2 finals were won cz of this.,4
Imagine KLR playing for some stabilized team like MI where he can just bat with trust in middle and lower order.,7
I would rather have Kumble bat than Maxwell lol,5
KXIP better play Neesham over Maxi next match,8
Rohits field placements ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
Slashed it.,3
Didn‚Äôt RCB played yesterday,1
chutiya ball lol,4
What was this action?,6
Rahul isnt wrong when he says he has to bat long cuz their middle order is pure shit.,8
LMAO did he do a kedar there,5
Wtf,2
Krunal doing a Jadhav . Haha,3
"Tamil commentators have started talking about next match, but they praise kl tho.",1
This shithouse action deserves to get cunted around,2
Man KL Rahul is something else,4
Krunal always goes for the weird shit and gets beaten up,8
"2 more Bumrah overs. Unless KL hits a century, this is game over.",3
Mark Nicholas repeated his EA cricket lines,6
lmfao wtf is krunal doing...,8
Kings XI Punchoke,2
Lost count of how many seasons Maxwell has been hyped and then performed like trash in IPL.,6
KXIP will be staging a comeback only to lose it in the last over. Old script now.,5
What was krunal trying?,3
"Didn't try to hit it too hard, just stroked it into the gap",2
Wtf was that action,2
Wtf was that by krunal,2
WTF is that bowling action?,3
You need 12 from each over other than Boomrah.,4
Something's wrong with Maxwell. Looks like he needs a break to develop confidence in his batting capability. Everyone wants to see 2014-15 Maxi back again.,10
Atleast give Neesham a proper chance lol,2
Sabko malinga banna hai bencho,10
Discount pandya trying to be oversmart,5
Krunal deserves to get smashed for that ball,9
"Mark Nicholas saying ""didn't try to hit that too hard"" gave me some Cricket 07 flashbacks.",9
Call punjab guano because they're opposite of Batdeep,3
Maxi being torn into on the Dugout. :(,9
"Kings XI, play sensibly, not bang bang every ball. Stay in the game u idiots.",3
How many times MI bowlers stopped bowling.,9
[deleted],9
"lol I was just going to comment, please Krunal don't do anything oversmart",5
"How good has rahul been

If only he had a sensible middle order batsman

Where is mandeep singh btw... 

Had really great season for RCB before mega auction",4
Krunal just annoys me like noone else lol. Not that he's bad or anything!,4
You can't just imitate Jadhav you pleb,9
isn't that a throw ball,2
President!,1
Krunal with that batta pace street cricket bowling action,3
Kedar Pandya,2
"Maxwell's 8 previous failures should have been enough warning signs. But nope, lets play him in 9th match and fuck it all up.",8
"KXIP batting line up is like that chinese phone. Insane specs but not reliable.

KL on the other hand is quality.",7
"Not KXIP, maybe KIIP coz only KL and Mayank!",9
Still kxip gamez to lose,1
Are there any hard hitters left in KXIP ?,1
KXIP could have won at least one of the very close game if Maxwell had played sensibly. Either gets out in an over or wastes balls missing reverse scoop,11
Bowl normal you fucking idiot,4
"Mark Nicholas just said ""didn't try to hit it too hard"" I came in my pants",11
"Neesham can't do worse than Maxi. Bring him back, lol.",22
I hate Murali Karthik,11
Every year I start off hoping to see 2014 Maxwell again. Especially with him back at K11. Hasn't worked out so far though. With the bat anyway. I think I've been waiting almost as long for Hooda to come good again too. I stubbornly remain an optimist on both counts!,7
"If they had a Competent number 5, they would have been in playoffs, but Maxi lol",8
And to think there was a time I was sad to see maxi leave Delhi,9
is hardik injured to bowl?,1
Maxwell out.                                                                            0 imposters left.,17
The sasta malinga,7
good guy krunal helping out his bro's best friend,7
Chad Krunal Jadhav vs Virgin Kedar Pandya,1
"What Rohit is to KKR, Rahul is to us.",7
"Hooda is basically Maxwell, but somehow worse.",8
"Feel so bad for kl. He's been so consistent and has the orange cap but is stuck with such a shit team where he can't play his natural fame and has to anchor or else the team collapse.

Hope this ipl doesn't discourage him",8
"krunal successfully distracting batsman with weird actions and getting away with decent overs, part of his mind games^tm",13
Just one man army battle now,5
Not trying to jinx but I think we've got this in our bag as KL is the only reliable bat remaining now.,5
Krunal looks more cocky than Hardik for some reason,12
Just 8 off a Krunal over is gold lol,7
Can Chris Jordan bat? Not familiar with him,3
"Mumbai literally has a dream 11, it‚Äôs kinda disgusting no offence to MI fans though",11
At least KXIP won‚Äôt lose the match in the last 3 overs while batting lol.,2
52 off 30 balls same like KKR vs SRH match,4
So Zaheer writes with right hand but bowls with left hand. Interesting.,3
Who do we bring in even if we drop Maxwell? We don't have any other reliable batter either.,5
Hooda is basically like Yusuf Pathan. You don't know what you will get out of him,6
"never understood the rules for clean bowling action, for us laymen that delivery by Krunal was illegal 'feki' ball",7
"If I was Hardik, I would wear wig for a month or so.",11
Krunal bowling like my 7 year old nephew.,7
"Maxwell played like a God in that final ODI, wonder what is happening.",2
Boomz will take care of KL next over.,5
"*Didn't try to hit too hard . Just just stroked it away*

Did Mark Nicholas say that again .

From the cricket 07 commentary",9
Can KL keep them alive? I hope so,1
Had hardik been a passenger this IPL? Barely remember him doing anything substantial besides hitting 2-3 boundaries and getting out.,3
Maxwell is a specialist bowler just like Cummins is a specialist batsman.,11
Punjab doesn‚Äôt have to mandatorily play 4 foreign players. Leave maxi out ffs,11
absolute scenes if we lose to CSK tomorrow,2
"With all that has transpired, 52 in 30 is achievable. Bumrah however is the issue!",7
Well atleast my boi Jordan is also there to bat if kxip need 1 off 3,7
I feel sometimes that krunal has an attitude problem.,9
"People give KL a lot of stick. About his strike rate, about being more conserned about the orange cap but the fact of the matter is, Punjab wouldn't even have those 4 points if it wasn't for him. He's single handedly carrying this horribly unbalanced team..",16
I would love to see kumble or rahul saying maxwell was a bad buy. We deserve to lose for buying him,3
kxip already ahead of where mi were at the 17th over,6
Styris unflattered seeing Uthappa as X Factor for tomorrow's match kek.,5
"Mi scored 54 of 3

Kxip needs 52 of 5 with 2 extra wickets in hand

But still r underdogs to win the game

Just shows how op MI are",12
Lol one match and Robin Uthappa is X factor,8
KL would be a great fit at DC. He can free his mind and make our team almost unbeatable.,10
"I have been following Cricket for over 20 years now and I love that we have ""laws"" while other sports merely have ""rules""",8
Remember Hardik's walk in the park that saw him get run out against SA last year? Sunny G tore into him lol.,6
Any other team Maxwell would have warmed the bench so hard would have solved global cooling. But no KXIP are too good to bench him,9
As an MI fan I want kxIp to win today to make it to the top 4 somehow.,4
Sometimes I think Punjab doesn't deserve KL,10
Please Rahul win the match for KXIP,6
Hands down Brohit should be captaining IND in LOC.,9
The only silver lining is Rahul has been excellent today. I don't know how long it will last,6
"Glenn Maxwell in IPL
50s - 6
ü¶Ü - 10",8
"And ppl wonder why KL said strike rate is overrated in t20.

Sometimes when your whole team collapses faster than a tower a cards, you can either get have a high strike rate and get out with 50 runs left or take the game through",8
"Watch people still say that ""strike rate is overrated"",  ""he is playing for the orange cap"" and ""these are meaningless runs""",16
2 overs of Bumrah left. No way KXIP is winning this,7
Coulter Nile - Bumrah - Coulter Nile - Bumrah - Boult?,3
Imagine paying $2000 at a top class hair salon there for that haircut,6
Malinga may leave MI but MI doesn't let go Malinga,7
Only thing KXIP can do now: Maxwell & Gayle open... KL no.3 Mayank no.4 Pooran No. 5 ... maybe this way they can finally have a middle order lol,6
It's a wonder if Maxwell scores runs~ dugout,5
"Story Time- Krunal was hanging in the lounge of the Mumbai airport, my eyes met his, he asked me to come over. My awkwardness hit peak at that time and I just awkwardly smiled and didnt move an inch. Never been more embarassed",12
"2 from Bumrah, 2 from Coulter, & 1 from boult.",3
"Just saying, if KXIP win and KKR lose their next 2 games, KXIP have a legitimate shot at Top 4",9
Why the fuck is Maxwell still playing?,8
Bumrah 2 for 4. üòØ,3
Boult to get Rahul and fulfill his redemption arc,6
"MI fans, who would you rather have, NCN or Patto?",8
Chennai being second on fair play is the biggest joke,14
"dont get your hopes too high, this team choked from 1 off 3 and almost choked from 14 off 21",4
Never seen a team choke better than ours,2
Hardik Aang Pandya,2
I think RR twitter admin prepares a lot more RR players before a match.,5
The thing that set MI apart from other teams is balance and the fact that someone always steps up when required and not rely upon 1-2 players to bail them out everytime,5
Maxwell's new change in stance is exposed big time in this IPL. The leg spinners are having a field day against him. He is trying to hit everything to legside against the spin which is not a very good option.,7
KL needs to talk to the other guy about facing Bumrah,3
MI of 2020= CSK of 2013,1
What did RR do lol,2
Bumrah has got a wicket every time he's been brought on,1
"Amir's Ceat and Joshi's HDFC, just need Madhavan to do a shitty ad to complete the 3 idiot triumvirate of horrible ads",4
" Kl , can you come to rr pls?",0
Glenn Maxwell fame meter is now closer to Ghislaine Maxwell than James Maxwell,2
Game depends on Hooda,3
With any other team you can say they are in good position if they need 50 off last 5 with their opener still batting but with KXIP we know what's gonna happen. :(,2
Who in the KXIP squad can replace Maxi? He‚Äôs just not worth it anymore.,4
Bumrah is 2-4 from 2. ULTIMATE OP,4
Pandya almost gave away 5 runs,3
I always smile when I see the Heineken ad with Bond. Nicely done.,4
Krunal Pandya is looking like a side villain from 80's bollywood movie.,9
"Except 2-3 innings for RR in 2015, I've never seen Hooda do anything of note in IPL.",3
I don't generally shit on players for bad form. But Maxwell actually had the audacity to say he didn't get enough chances to express himself. Bigshow? More like Shitshow.,12
What beer brand would you recommend for a first timer?,7
Krunal is like us playing street cricket who tries weird shits when a batsman is not getting out,14
Maxwell hasn't even hit a 6 this IPL. No show.,20
75% of Maxwell‚Äôs 50s in the IPL came in half a season in 2014.,22
Easy win for punjab,-4
Shit that looks bad,2
"KXIP when they are bowling - Wow they don't have that good bowlers, maybe they are packing their team with top batsmen



KXIP when they are batting - Wow the batting falls of a cliff after Pooran. They must be playing good specialist bowlers",15
"‚ÄúKings 11 trying their best to lose this game‚Äù. 

IPL 2020 official tag line that",13
Why are all the team physios fat as fuck? shouldnt you be fit yourself to work on other peoples bodies?,2
"Fuck now kishan too, I thought only dc had injury issues",10
Ooh that looks ugly for Kishan,4
just chill out this over kl,5
Fuck we just lost a good fielder,2
"Need KLs wicket otherwise he will win it for sure, no way he will take it to last ball again",3
Fuck I hope he's alright,2
MI physio has had a meal too many at Antilia it seems,5
Saurabh Tiwary likes this,12
"Oh no Ishan Kishan Injured,  Saurabh Tiwari Back in",7
Mumbai's physio is an absolute unit,13
That is so sudden,2
Oh dear... doesn‚Äôt look good going by the reactions...,3
Specialist fielder anukul roy in.,7
"How good is Hooda guys, haven‚Äôt seen him bat at all",1
Glenn Maxwell has scored 58 runs in this season at a SR of 92.,7
Thicc doc,3
Punjab winning,2
Saurabh Tiwary's masterplan has initiated hehehe,3
Wait the substitute fielder coming in looks like Mithali Raj,10
"I won't do that *dhumka* , and I'm ready to pay for it too",4
"I'm getting football vibes lately. I'm not doubting the injury, but players are getting injured easily.",1
"If Hamstring, Kishan might be out for few matches.",6
"Fuuuuck it hurts, take me outta here. Wait bc, lemme get my cap on.",10
Drinking game: Take a shot every time you see a TikTok ripoff ad.,3
Rahul chahar-lite is on the substitute fielder,4
KL can score 1k runs but it won't mean shit if he doesn't see them through at least this match,-1
"In next 28 balls, KXIP has to face 10 balls from Bumrah",3
Hooda really improved his technique. Looks really good now,1
Not the ground to dive in. Terrible below the layer of grass.,3
Ladies and gentlemen we have a garbage bag on the field,1

"I'm 100% sure after struggling this entire IPL, Maxwell will hit a 50 ball 100 his next international T20 because thats how much of a IPL fraud he is",12
I have a feeling Rahul's gonna take them home today. Take my power Bumrah,4
Did Pooran needed to play that shot against Bumrah?,5
Woah that physio/assistant physio is an absolute unit!,3
H.A.M.S.T.R.I.N.G. Jayawardena in action,2
Why doesn't Kishan keep at all? Is De Kock a bad fielder?,2
"I dont want to say hooda is bad . But wouldn't having someone like Gowtham help with the batting overall? 

Considering Maxwell form, might as well bring in Cottrell or mujeeb to utilise the 4th overseas player slot",4
I hope you fucks can stop criticizing KL now.,9
RR worst in fair play. Has it got something to do with sandpaper,5
So who will buy Maxwell for 10 cr next season,9
"KL just stay away from Bumrah, smash Boult",2
"Knew somebody will get injured today

Last 3 games has had at least 1 injury every game

More of Injury Premiere League",8
It hurts when one of the youngest in the team is most injury prone,9
Anukul Roy has to be holding the record for being in the field for max instances when not even being in the 11,8
Why was Ishan walking when the Doc could have just carried him in his arms?,10
Imagine how badly Maxwell would be trolled if KXIP had fans,132
Rahul is so fucking good,6
Stylish cut,6
punjab has the highest caliber to choke till the last moment,10
The hamstring curse gets Ishan too.,7
"Said it already, this is 2018 Wankhede game repeat. Bumrah got Rahul out on 94",7
KL Rahul‚Äôs not gonna get out today. I know.,5
Another opportunity to socre a ton KL,6

Why don't they just ban hamstring injuries? So many players suffer from it every year,5
I think we are done here.,5
How's Jordan at batting? Can do a cameo or not?,3
Hooda WTF,4
I hope Rahul isn't pushed into the middle order to accommodate Dhawan for T20 WC,11
15 off a bumrah over kill me already,12
Looks like luck wasn't only our side,6
Almost forgot Hooda used to hit those big 6s 3-4 seasons back.,7
Wow.... How tf did he hit that for six.,7
God damn.. 15 off that Bumrah over,10
hooooodaaaaaa!!!!!,5
Unexpected but I‚Äôll take it lmao.,3
"damn that came out of nowhere 
 
That too against bumrah of all bowlers",1
Bumrah getting smashed? Not expected that one,3

"On lower order batting, One of the reasons I highly doubt our chances to win an ICC tournament is our tail because to win such tournaments you need to dominate on your good days and struggle but win on your bad days too. You can't expect all of your gamedays to be good.
Our batting falls off a cliff after Pandya(who still has to prove his reliability to play long innings in ODIs at 7). Kuldeep, Chahal, Shami and Bumrah are walking wickets. 
2011 WC winning team had Raina, Bhajji and Zaheer, which is a much better lower order.",3
Hooda>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Maxwell,4
Wtf is bumrah trying? Bc you're attacking bowler not defensive.,2
Hooda used to be pretty decent for SRH. Why did they leave him & go to inexperienced indian players?,5
Not a good over for Bumrah. Bonus for KXIP.,2
How's Hooda in domestic?,2
Oooooo things are getting interesting now.,3
"Woah. Big over, and off Bumrah as well",4
Bumrah getting cunted by a nobody has been a bad trend for him this IPL,8
Bhnchods I wanted yall to win but not smack bumrah for FFS coming back to support my team now üò§,9

From Hooda fuck is that guy to Hooda is the real deal in one over,4

Hooda had one big innings for SRH that I remember - always looks like he could be destructive but hope he can convert his start today.,6
"People trashing Hooda in the match thread. Here you fucking go. This is Hooda. No runs with no boundaries, but when he does get it, it's done.",7

If MI plays like RCB played in last 3 seasons or KXIP playing in this season they will lose 60% fan base just in 3 years,1
The way KXIP play at death the prediction should still be like 70% in MI's favour,2
Pollard looks in pain,5
Pollard jumping on the ball with the momentum of a semi truck is peak dedication,7

We are entering meme territory now,9
ah even Pollard couldn't save MI this match. Rahul OP.,11
Will we get another masterclass from punjab to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory?,7
Lol they used min 7 balls as a criterion.,3
It‚Äôs KXIP so can‚Äôt be sure if they will win till the last run is scored.,6
"29 to win, 26 for century. Easy maths KL",11
Who's going to bet on KXIP choking,4

Seems like even Kohli's jinx wishing Kumble birthday didnt work,10
"A set Indian superstar batsman at the death in a tight chase vs Coulter-Nile...

Where have I seen this before?",10
Imho Rahul is waaayy underappreciated for what he is doing this season. Imagine playing with this middle order and rightfully being concerned of your wicket and people criticize you for that.,68
Damn Rahul reminds me of peak Virat. So good.,11
MI gonna lose their top 2 spot to RCB now.,7
Pls another century kl,9
Why KL is wearing blue shoes,1
"MI lose is acceptable, win is not at expense of health of players",5
Nothing interesting. Just the no.1 t20i batter in his genius form,10
Sorry it's totally random. Any good horror shows in netflix?,2
Will it come down to 3 balls 1 run?,6
"As much as i know KXIP, MI is still winning by 5 runs",3
"on one hand not looking good for Bambai, on the other hand it's punjab",4

"They have to target 16 off Bumrah's two by cricinfo

they got 15 in one over itself.",3
Right now Rahul has scored more than half of kxip runs,10
"It's Punjab they are supposed to lose on their own, what is this",10
MI's biggest mistake today was not sending in Pollard higher up the order.,3
Long shot but if KXIP want a shot at the playoffs they gotta finish this by the 19th over at the most.,2
KL has been way too fucking good. People shit on his strike rate way too much,19

I love select dugout man,5
KL is the first and last line of defense for Punjab.,5
28 off 20..cant lose from here surely,2
Swann is going bonkers. That ABD assault on his beloved RR has nudged him off the cliff.,10
Extracting choke.tar.,4
Rahul goat! Don't fuck it up now,4
Hooda looks considerably older and worn out since I last saw him the previous season,3
Yeah get fucked Mumbai,2
"Fun fact: As a 20 year old, Deepak Hooda was awarded the Lala Amarnath Trophy for being India's best all rounder in the 2014-15 domestic season.",10
Being a KXIP fan is not good for heart. Am I gonna die younger?,3
Hooda hits a six then plays a Gully Cricket shot,3
"Know what swanny, just give us the break and stop singing",3
Hooda stop playing predetermined shots like that!,6
A player/captain scores  500 for 3 consecutive seasons and yet the team languishes at bottom half for 3 seasons. Shows how much his teams mates have let him down (especially this year when they have assembled a damn good squad).,39
Rahul is a player KXIP management needed but they don't deserve.,50
No need to hit crazy shots just play smartly. Get us over the line,6
"It‚Äôs not over yet fellas, Punjab can still fuck this up",8
28 off 20 should be achievable easily for most* teams.,10
Match is basically one 20 run over short of being over. And bumrah can only bowl 1 out of last 3. Easy for kxip,0
If KXIP loose today we all should start a petition to #rescueKLfromKXIP,13
If KL goes to the playoffs I'll support them against RCB and KKR.,8
"Ukw, I want kxip to win, can't imagine how dejected their fans will feel after losing this one",10
I can‚Äôt even complain if MI lose this. It‚Äôs been a legit good innings from KL.,17
"Maxwell is pretty much gone now, right?",3
Ncn learning from pollard,2
Even though I am a Mi fan I am supporting kxip cuz I feel bad for KL,14
Hooda dont do anything stupid now,3
Who will bowl next? Bumrah or Boult?,2
Tired of this pulling up shit,1
CSK is on 2nd in fair play award. And I thought my jokes were unfunny,14
KL Rahul is the only Kohli level player I have seen in the recent times.,6
Why do I have a feeling that KXIP are gonna come 5th and miss out due to NRR and then blame that short run for it,6
Another superover?,2
Should bowl bumrah next over,3
"God,  Swanny is obsessed with RR ffs",3
Fuckin another 500+ season no other player has crossed 400 yet,13
"Guys imagine winning the WTC and the WT20 next year. We will have 5 world championships across 3 different formats.

Who am I kidding? It will probably be the Aussies with 7 world championships across 3 different formats",6
Is Pattinson injured or just dropped? He looked more threatening than NCN does tbh.,2
"~~KL~~ Kal-LRahul

Absolute superman for his team",2
"Yes Hooda on strike, Bring in Boult and don't give a single",3
"Maxwell is clearly a confidence player, hence why he‚Äôs had to take mental health breaks before. Hopefully he manages to get past this rough patch",4
"This is where Rahul is so much better than Warner or Bairstow. Rahul can actually make up for a slow start and accelerate. You can tell when SRH will lose the game just by watching the first couple of overs faced by Warner and Bairstow. If they look ‚Äúoff‚Äù, SRH will certainly lose.",13
9rpo is so achievable....hope Punjab don't get their usual jitters.,7
Fair play by Coulter Nile,3
Hooda will rahooooool's century and be dropped next match,3
"Rahul, Mayan, Gayle, Pooran  -- all are in form; KXIP has maxed the batting yet here we are.",5
I dont know why everyone criticizes Rahul for playing forb orange cap.  His team is shit and he is carrying them.,9
"Shikhar ne century maara.


Mein bhi maaroonga",3
"Pooran not only smacked a real important cameo, but also extracted one over of Bumrah from the death. He had to come on to get him.

Had Rahul shielded Pooran from Bumrah things would've gotten even more dodgy for MI",5
Only kxip can lose from here,9
Will Boult get fourth?,6
Now I know why Koach always backed KL. Good job Koach,13
Kxip will still throw this away..,3
Probably his 4th or 5th decent Hooda innings in 62 matches,1
"Kkr can we get prasidh krishna for loan, only one over plz",1

only punjab can lose from here,4
Cork already talking about MI losing this one. It's Punjab - not sure until the last run is scored.,3
"Lara isn't holding back, lol.",1
I have no problem with KL playing it safe & sticking to the end while other partners go blazing.,5
Who do Punjab needs in the Middle order to become Champions?,3
Rohit unfazed after being shot at point blank on his nuts,4
Is it just me or does Graeme Swann sound like Andy from the office,5
Who are the chick's in kxip stands,3
This is past from Boomrah. Don't do anything stupid.,5
"Kings better win this for all those KL fans, can't choke now.",22
Please get KL,1
This is y he is less confident of bowling yorkers,5
"Just play around Bumrah's over, try and get 7-8 runs and this match is in the bag for Punjab.",2
Crucial over this,2
Needless,2
Rahul vs Bumrah . Wont mind if this over is a conservative one,3
I will always rate KL Rahul as a good batsman overall for his performance in the Ind vs Aus test series in 2017. Scored 6 fifties in 4 matches while other Indian batsmen(except Pujara) struggled. Kohli averaged 9 in that series lmao,2
Rohit is hands down the best captain,1
MI just need to get the final equation down to 1 run needed of 3 balls and watch KXIP work their magic.,2
Am I the only one who thinks hardik‚Äôs new hairstyle is awful,6
Everytime I feel Bumrah's pace has dropped he bowls one at 145 kmph.,4
Its a shame KL shits his bed in tests. Was really good till the home series vs aus where he scored 50s for fun.,7
BOOM BOOM,4
Should‚Äôve been easy from here.give Preity something to cheer and smile please !,3

Benchod kya yorker dala hai,4
That's a propah yorker!,5
"If KXIP win from here, they'll have a new hero.",2
Bumrah is OP pls nerf,3
6D move by Rohit to concede that overthrow,7
"Story is repeating itself, wtf",1
"Bumrah - dismissed Mayank, Pooran, Rahul. 

Worth every penny",18
"Pack it up, bois, it's over.",2
Probably the best ball of the IPL so far,3
And this isn't even Bumrah's final form,6
"Bumrah... was rooting for Kings but I fucking love that guy, way too good",5
Omfg what a yorker!!! That rivals those of Ferguson‚Äôs today,6
Imagine having a shittier middle order than srh,7
Bc Preity Zinta looked happier in veer zaara than KXIP matches,9
Siiiiuuuuu booomrahh,2
"Can't blame KL Rahul here, all the pressure goes to him. Punjab just don't have a good middle order (could argue it's good but just not in form)",7
Thats got to be the fastest ball that Bumrahs bowled in the IPL.,6
That was a wicked yorker. Fucking diabolical.,3
BALL OF THE YEAR,3
This one resembles of that stokes vs Starc in wc,7
And that's game,2
Kxip being kxip,2
"It's coming, it's coming!",1
Bowling out a set batsman... Only Bumrah can do this,2
Welp pack it up boys,1
More sad for KL than happy for our win tonight,9
Bumrah being the chad he is,3
148.5 k,2
149 yorker. No doubt many here call Bumer a cheat code. What a day Bumer has had!,9
"Boom Boom champion saala. Bring on Australia, our boy is ready to wreck your toes.",5
A wicket in every over. Bumrah the slayer.,5
"BOOM BOOM BUMRAH, THE KING!",3
148.5KMPH just DAMN!,11
PUT SOME RESPECT ON THAT NAME,7
"Damn, another great move by Rohit. Please BCCI.",7
Man this is such a great bowling and now i am sad,7
BUMRAH THE OG GIANT SLAYER.,6
I am in for two in two super overs,12
Kings XI Punjab lost their first and only wicket.,5
Bumrah: Is this your king?,27
The way Rohit uses Bumrah and how Bumrah responds everytime is almost art,19
5D chess from Rohit Sharma by giving an extra run,15
"Brilliant ball, match done for kxip",5
That's game for punjab.,8
Well played champ. It was a good delivery. Go Jordan and Hooda.,8
Well played KL. Your team sucks tho.,16
inb4 hooda hits 4 6s,7
Yeah that's unplayable,9
"Rahul this season is the second coming of Christ: Performs miracles and goes down paying for the sins of those around him. 

Bless the Messiah! The Martyr!",26
"Bumrah is a cheat code wtf, 150 kph dead accurate yorker",14
For fuck sakes,4
"That was a great ball, cant be mad at getting out to that",7
Batting Collapse incoming!,1
Damn man kl looks so dejected,6
"Unreal bowl, you dont expect to defend that even if you are the best in the world",9
Game set and match,1
Bumrah u madmannn,3
Nooooooo :(,2
Bumrah is the ABD of bowling,9
"**17.3** Bumrah to Rahul, OUT, bowled'im. Oh Bumrah. That piece of magic upsets all calculations and plans. What a piece of bloody magic. Yorker at 149ks to peg the off stumps back. And that is not all. It seems Rahul has the line covered, but it seems it shapes away late to beat his outside edge and then hit the wicket **153-5**

KL Rahul  b Bumrah 77 (51b 7x4 3x6) SR: 150.98",3
Rahul should go straight to the hospital to get an MRI done to check if his back is okay after carrying his team every game,10
so Rohit was playing 4D chess lol by giving extra run,5
Pooran not controlling himself against bumrah has really been costly,3
65 million years. Zap,0
Boult having an off day still gives kxip an outside chance,2
"Boom boom, yahaan fast nahi chalta. Tera mini over.",9
Thanks K11P. I needed a higher dosage of entertainment.,1
KXIP find a way to make things interesting again... The match has just turned on its head again.,3
"148.5!!!

Fuking Rockstar!!",3
Shit Jordan doesn't bat does he??,3
"Bumrah is too good, how is he indian?",-2
Death rattle porn,4
Look at Rohit's wide smile - that's a man who's got a goddamn cheat code in the game,8
"Respect to KL, great innings he played.",7
game over bois it was fun while it lasted,2
149 kph Yorker that!!!üî•,3
Heart filled with sadness and darkness,1
Lara always favors the chasing team - even after watching these teams play for more than a month.,4
Seething inside rn but I‚Äôm glad we have them both in the national team.,9
"Match is gone, but super proud of KL today. Pure courage in the face of adversity.",3
Now that's a destructive Yorker which is missing from Natarajan(SRH). Hope he works on that.,5
KXIP to MI: Choke me daddy,9
"Another KXIP collapse?


Count me in.",1
"What a bowler! 

He hasn't been landing Yorkers as consistently lately, lots of low full tosses. That's why this one was huge. 148KPH as well. Amazing.",9
Speed ?,1
"Everyone ignoring KL's good performances  and shitting on him for not being there till the end, how many other teams have openers batting till the end? How much do you expect from the poor guy?",6
"Rohit honestly reads the game much better than what people credit him . Such an aggressive move to bowl Bumrah the 18th, paid off as well.",7
Serious question.. as sh!t as Maxwell been.. does KXIP have anyone better to replace him with?.. I mean hes sh!t with bat but hes bowled 4 overs and had a decent economy,8
I can't with this team...,2
At least Chris Jordan is better than Mujeeb at #7.,2
"So conflicted right now.. Sad what's happened to my team on that last ball, but happy that it was done by an Indian fast bowler.",8
"What a freakin yorker that was, I can watch that all day",3
Gotta feel bad for kl. Dude did his absolute best and it still may not be enough,11
"Jordan is here boys...

*Sadda haq wo leke hi rahega*",2
Boomrah: Boom 2+2 is 4 minus 1 that 3 quick maffs!!,3
"Swing at Bumrah, Deepak",2
A team with 11 match winners vs A one man army,9
MI is really lucky to have Bumrah :),10
Shades of MI vs KXIP 2018 in this match,2
I still can't digest the fact that Bumrah only gets paid 7 crores. Hopefully MI raises his salary.,11
I dont think match is over yet,3
Fun fact: Deepak Hooda's favourite stroke is the pull.,2
That ball reminded me of starcs ball to stokes at the wc just killed the chase with that Yorker.,7
Booooom,1
"‚úÖ Orange cap innings

‚ùå Winning the match",0
"Swanny it was abd yesterday, are you genuinely retarded?",2
Fuck you bumrah where was this vs new Zealand,13
Priety ZInta being crushed was kinda sad.,10
"Swanny like every tech expert, that computer needs rebooting",4
Remember how many runs MI scored after 5 down,3
can jordon make up for his 20 runs last over?,6
We are not going to win untill and unless we get rid of this Arsenal jersey -_-,9
Punjab needs therapy more than training,8
maxwell has been the biggest downfall of this team. you can‚Äôt have that weak of a link in this shallow of a batting lineup. everyone needs to contribute if the batting isn‚Äôt deep,6
Bumrah or Lockie today?,1
Rohit always makes funny faces,5
Jordan scored at 200 SR  50 in Eng vs Ind game didn't he?,3
It‚Äôs not even close to over idk what y‚Äôall thinking,6
Why Punjab ALWAYS gives Heartattack to the fans.,4
Those late Polly & NCN's hits are starting to give me pain now.,5
"Yuvraj tweeted an hour ago that KXIP will win IPL 2020

I'll have what he's having",14
These jokers at KXIP don't deserve KL,9
Bumrah is breathing fire here... Play him out and hit the rest. A calm head should see this home for KXIP.,3
Why the fuck are we sending in Jordan at 7,1
KXIP is back in the game^of_losing,7
Feeling bad for KL Rahul,8
7D chess by Rohit to concede the over throw to keep Rahul on strike and get him out,4
If bumrah had one more over. We could win this. But alas.,3
Why does kl always look sad in his pic?,1
Boom Boom Bumrah,3
We r crushing top teams and losing or almost losing to meme teams.... I love mi,7
"gg bumrah

ez maxi",3
Who'll ball the remaining overs?,4
Bumrah is the real MVP in Indian Cricket.,5
Hope Punjab knows that this is the last real ball from Mumbai. Anything else from hereon is free real estate.,2
Rohit just woke up from a deep slumber ü§£,2
What a fucking game. Balls swinging between the two teams. Cricket truly is the best sport.,7
"I wanna love you KXIP, but you make it sooooo hard",7
Hooda looks so composed against Bumrah. Where was he all this time?,5
Can Bumrah bowl running in from mid-off next time please? Might be little easier for him.,4
MI‚Äôs NRR goes brrrrr,8
"Bumrah single handedly destroying kxip batting order

Mayank

Rahul

Pooran

Game over",22
Can Jordan hit big sixes?,5
I want Jordan to just swing it now,2
Looking forward to r/cricket  scapegoating Rahul again after this loss,11
Oh man I don't think I can handle one more sadness filled post match Interview of KL,3
Does every team in IPL get similar budgets for players?.. seems like MI has all the good players,7
This is where we gonna miss Malinga now. The game is still with KX.,5
Bumrah's pace is back at it's peak. Good signs ahead of Aus tour (touch wood).,15
Actually it's a good time to pyramid another bet backing K11P as their odds shoot up.,2
When was the last time somebody from the bottom of the table walked away with an Orange cap? Asking for a friend.,7
"22 of 12 still winnable for KXIP..
Edit.. Boult has one over left",4
"KL reminds me of Hektor from the movie Troy. He knows he is one of the best, but have to face the invincible in the battle.",5
"kl rahul day plan: wake up, eat, score half the runs for the team, get yelled at, sleep. REPEAT...",96
"Mi , please release bumrah


/s",5
Bumrah bowled one perfect yorker this over and it resulted in a wicket of a batsman batting at 77,12
MI have so many match winners it is just crazy.,13
Have seen Jordan handle a bat before. Lets hope,3
"KL was batting so well, it was just unimaginable that he could be bowled. Such an amazing yorker.",9
"Lol, Mumbai with a wicket more looked more solid. What is this squad",4
Man don't show kl sulking. Feelsbadman,5
KXIP is the unluckiest team,5
Man I feel so bad for KL someone give him a hug pls,7
Bumrah should always trust his yorkers and get rid of his tendency to go length,3
2 overs 23 with 5 wickets,2
Man how perfect was that yorker. Bumrah is unreal.,4
Man...feels for KL Rahul üíî,10
Can Hooda do an Axar from yesterday?  Mushkil to nahi keh sakte but difficult zaroor hoga,1
Does Bumrah get ‚Çπ15 Crores ? Because he fucking should.,8
It‚Äôs unfair that theoretically Rahul can bat for 20 overs but Bumrah only bowls 4.,2
"Lol he wants Pollard üòÇüòÇ, come on Lara.",1
Who's gonna do a tewatia here?,1
Maybe with Australia Maxwell knows he can lose his spot so he he continues to perform for them. With KXIP it seems no matter how shit he plays he continues to get in so he doesn't seem invested enough to play as well as he does for Australia,2
Instagram reels ad ah? Nice.,1
That spell was the fastest I‚Äôve ever seen bumrah bowl. Every ball over 145 his last over wow,6
"If Boult and NCN can ball 2 yorkers each, MI will win. 
Else they will concede lucky boundaries and lose.",2
"Had KL defended that over from Bumrah, this would have been so easy for Punjab.",4
Bumrah gonna be the MoM today?,4
"Wonder if SunnyG says ""Pressure has been released."" whenever he farts back at his house.",9
"90's

India:KXIP::Sachin:Rahul",15
same thing for rahul last year as well v mumbai,5
Still Punjab's game to lose,3
Madhuri is such a hottie still,4
lmao Cottrell sitting on the stairs away from the rest of the team like he's an outcast,7
Super over anyone?,5
Rohit Sharma captaincy too OP man,5
Still don't understand the overly defensive 3rd over of Bumrah. He delivered perfectly when he attacked.,6
Bumrah gets 7cr. Unadkat got 10cr. Maxwell gets 10cr. Cummins gets 15cr,10
"Lara please, not Pollard. Boult has bowled in WC pressure",4
"Supporting KXIP is like supporting Indian team in 90s, if KL/Sachin gets out the hope to win collapses.",12
Ashwin left because he couldn't take it anymore. KL will be gone soon. Only shitty KXIP management and Maxwell will remain.,16
Shit Hooda trying to swing,3
MAKE IT OR BREAK IT OVER for KXIP,4
20 off 11 is very doable even with these two. It‚Äôs Punjab‚Äôs to lose.,6

Oh the dreadful late cuts in death overs. Love to see it,1
Rahul became angel?,1
Glad to see people actually feel for KL on here instead of shitting on him,12
Pollard coming to a stop like Mechanical Brakes on a Semi,4
That was easily ball of the tournament. To bowl out a player who is set and was not trying to play a crazy shot as well. I hope they give him MOM even if KXP pulls it off.,1
This is getting to close.,2
Great shot Hooda! Let's gooo,1

"Looks worse every replay, wtf Jordan?",8
Btw very weird line run there by Jordan there.. his turn for the 2nd lost him precious yards. Definitely expect better from a professional cricketer..,3
MI should lose.,1
ipl honestly better scripted than 90% of tv shows ever made,3

Kings 11 will lose this. They don't have bowler like Bumrah,6
Jordan tried to come in the way of ball..,4
Pollard and Rohit. The choice is easy for Mumbai.,4
Punjab isn't good at close matches and MI haven't won a super over. Match perfectly poised.,3
The way that he ran was a perfect example for a fixed match. They either wanted the ball yo strike him for a super over or a run out,0

Out!,1
Rahul is like why did i lose the strike.,2
Another 2 run super over,6
Bye bye pooran,1
dang it,1
"Punjab fans, describe your exact feelings in 3 words RIGHT NOW!!",2
Pooran has a super over block,2
No Dive : Redeemed,3
Not another shitty super over please,3
Pooran again losing his wicket in super over. Like against DC.,6
Pooran should never play in a super over. Never.,6
Not again,3
"Jasprit ""Ferguson"" Bumrah.",5
Pooran is absolutely shit in super overs.. has never opened account...,2
This game is taking longer at the end than a fucking NBA game,2
Pooran and golden ducks in the super over. Name a more iconic duo.,9
I thought Rahul had  a natural sad face like QdK but turns out he is sad for a reason,7
Pooran and super overs...,2
gayle stiffened up old man,2
"Someone should buy an ad space on Phub, slap ""KXIP"" on those dick-stroking shrinking animations and add *""Want to lose a few inches?""* 

10/10 will make some cryful wanks",6
Play Anukul just for fielding,3
Pooran and Super Overs man...,2
F,2
Someone tell kl that super over stats aren't counted so kl can play freely without keeping strike rates in mind..,4
Lara just pointed out Pooran isnt good at Super Overs. Genius for a reason !,6
Pooran got out first ball both times,4
MI coach flashed Rohit a vada pav from the dug out. no wonder such a fabulous smile.,7
Superb catch under pressure...let's gooo,3
Anukul Roy you beauty,3
Chris Lynn looking like Vin Diesel there,6
Another golden duck for Pooran in super overs,1
Brain Lara said it right Pooran has the worst record in Superovers,5
Super over's are just not Pooran's game. Lot of PTSD.,3
Pooran and Superover is a sad story...,6
Take that boy in the team man..,1
Lara called it lol,2
This specialist fielder is always taking one catch LOL,6
Pooran is the Bradman of super overs,2
Send Maxwell you cowards.,0
Does the wicket taken in superover goes into the stats? Like purple cap,2
Why would you send the worst super over player ever???,1
Pooran PTSD in front of Indian fast bowlers in super overs,1
I guess the writers had the same script for both the games today,7
Pooran yaar!,2
Anukul Roy specialist fielder ftw!,5
Sub fielder outdoing his paycheck.,4
Can't believe I'm saying this *Thank god I'm an RCB fan*,7
Just take four singles now,2
What a catch,2
Feels bad for punjab,2
Anukul Roy is a brilliant fielder,2
I miss teams scoring 10+ in superovers,4
Lmao Doulley thought it was Chahar,1
KxiP is this losing the game with extra steps?,2
"BUMRAH DESERVES MORE THAN 7CR. 


- Both Pandyas make more than him",6
"Fairplay should take into consideration that Subs dont field regardless, Anukul has been there almost everytime wtf",1
üíâüíâIPLüíâüíâ,1
Fuck BOOM-BOOM does it at crucial times.,1
Someone make that muscular doggo meme with Pooran in regular play vs Pooran in superover,3
"**Jasprit Bumrah is first bowler to bowl 4 Super overs in IPL**

vs GL

vs SRH

vs RCB

**vs KXIP**",2
Excellent catch by Chahar after that drop.,2
Haha. Same old story. Nothing surprising here.,5
I swear MI get so lucky at times,4
lmao hone this early and why this pooran never hit in super over always golden duck,1
Bumrah for Man of the Match if MI wins?,2
Tell me why Pooran becomes Chris Martin in Super Overs?,2
"There are actually guys who said it was all fixed, hahaha. Imagine the planning, take exact wickets so Jordon will come to bat, then field the ball one before that which was obvious 4, then make Jordon run like crazy.",10
Specialist fielder at it again,2
Everytime Kishan gets a hamstring and Ankul Roy comes and takes an absolute blinder. Tactical move right there,6
Amazing catch by Roy,3
Lara called it,3
this seems repeat of last superover,3
Pooran is shit in super over,6
Bumrah 2-0 Pooran,4
Pooran was also on the receiving end of Narine's maiden super over and two ducks in super overs this IPL,6
"At this point, It doesn't hurt anymore.",2
Fuck off KXIP,2
Brian Lara was very right on Pooran,3
"Nick Poo   


Booo!",1
Brian Lara knows everything,1
"Brian called it. He said that Pooran gets out in super overs, he should not be coming in.",3
Why can't we score off full tosses,2
Neesham's poker face lol,2
Pooran should be banned from superovers. Not his cup of tea.,9
Pooran has to be the worst super over batsman,7
Wtf hooda,1
Neesham looks so done with this stuff,7
Lmao Jimmy Neesham looks dead inside,9
lol maxi tryin to hide his face,1
Rabada and Bumrah trashed Pooran at super overs..,3
Man Neesham with the PTSD,4
"I wonder if Bumrah feels less pressure bowling first in Super Overs, simply because he is not defending.",5
Pooran is the Super Over Chris Martin,7
Punjab doing an SRH,1
"(P,0,0) run",3
Pooran is horrible in super overs,2
"Bc ek hi cinema do baar dekh raha hoon
Translation- watching same movie 2 times in a day",2
Neesham is dead inside lmao,11
send maxi in...,1
Pooran has had a poor run in super overs,6
"With the way MI are playing, they can afford Anukul as a professional fielder in the playing 11",8
Anukul Roy is been groomed to be MI's specialist substitute fielder.,6
Look at Neesham üòÇüòÇ,1
Wtf happened to Hardick Hairstyle lmao,6
Poor Neesham,6
Hooda? Seriously not Mayank,4
Full toss has probably been one of the best wicket taking deliveries,4
What the fuck? Hooda? No Mayans??,1
3 ducks in super over for Pooran or is it 4?,5
Just play all 6 balls you will be fine.,1
"Man, I don't know what to do",2
Who would have thought they'd send in Hooda.,2
"Pooran in super over ,

2 innings, 0 runs",3
This is the copy cat of KXIP vs DC match so far.. They need to come up with better scripts lol,6
no Gayle?,2
Fucking hardik pandya with his hideous hairstyles... He is gonna scare the shit out of his kid.,4
Why Hooda and not Gayle.. why not even Mayank..,3
Wouldn't mayank have been a better option?,6
Lmao hooda when you have Gayle and Mayank,7
does pooran have a 0 average in super overs?,3
Mumbai should have subbed anukul immediately after Chahar spell was over,5
I thought that was Chahar and was sure it will be dropped,2
"As a neutral, I want KXIP to win, makes the tournament more interesting",7
Wicket incoming,2
Jimmy Neesham just sitting there and wondering how many times am I going to go through this?,12
At this point they should just give Anukul Roy a game for all the catches he's taken,3
Nice job not sending Maxwell.,5
Pooran just can‚Äôt do superovers,3
Pooran's super over record is terrible.,3
"If you think IPL is scripted, better stop watching cricket all together as it would mean all the international players are involved in it, so basically the entire integrity of cricket is done. You can‚Äôt selectively pick and choose haha.",7
"Seeing the match on mute, with some Fugazi blasting in the background. Perfection!",2
Brohit's gonna have a Vada Pav party tonight!!!,3
No Gayle. They deserve to lose,2
"**Pooran in Super over in IPL2020**

0(1)

0(1)",10
The bowling so far from Bumrah has been quite average tbh,3
Is Anukul Roy leading the 'Substitute of the tournament' award?,5
"If you have Bumrah, you win the super over automatically",8
why not gayle?,3
Punjab really need a 'finisher'. It is Maxwell's job to close out such games but he has been useless.,7
Lol they brought in Hooda,2
hooda??,2
hooda chosen ahead of maxwell. can't see how maxi gets another game this season,6
They shouldve sent Agarwal or Gayle this is stupid,3
kxip bringing it upon themselves,3
Interesting matches are being ruined by this super overs,6
Jordan ran on the second pitch..,8
Jimmy Neesham looks like he has already read the script,13
Punjab is cursed this year,6
[removed],3
Can't be sad for a team that badly wants to lose,5
York him Boom.,3
Nicolas Pooran has a very bad record in super overs.,7
Why the heck is Hooda even in this?,4
Need two big dick sixes from Daddy Rahul.,3
Can bumrah bowl 6 full tossers? üòç,4
RUN TWO,2
2 really bad bowls by Bumrah there,3
Bumrah bowled 3 full tosses and they couldn't put even one away.,2
another dull super over ? Meh,4
No yorker has landed,2
No Mayank or Gayle? Odd choice,2
Bouncer incoming,2
"Hooda ahead of gayle and mayank??

This is koach 4d levels I cannot comprehend",7
Fuck off with Hooda. Where tf is Mayank,4
3 fucking full tosses,2
Yo that... Thats... Inexplicable from Jordan... HE WENT TO THE OTHER PITCH WHAT THE FFUUUUCK,8
"Downvote me, but pooran is shit",-3
Why send Hooda if you are not going to trust him with strike? Lol,14
Wtf KL? Come on,10
4 fucking full tosses,7
Dhoni moment,4
Bishnoi bowls they even have a shimmer of a chance,3
3rd Full toss still no boundary,7
Neesham would rather be browsing Reddit rn.,10
A lot of players do find it hard to smoke that low full toss out of the park. Brilliant to see Jaddu doing that in their last two games.,2
These players are unable to hit full tosses. Bad batters,2
"Jimmy having that look, world cup ptsd",5
KL - others strike rate doesn't matter,8
Strike rate is overrated,7
C'mon hit a six,2
Bumrah bowled 4 full tosses yet only gave away 3,4
Even RCB was not this shit,9
Fucks sake Bumrah is a cheat code.,2
i would have actually gone with agarwal instead of rahul,3
If he didn‚Äôt want him to give a strike then why even bring him to bat when you had other options?,1
Anukul roy being followed by the ball,1
Best ball goes for the most runs,1
That man bun fella has been busy in the super over.,1
Please Bumrah don't bowl a bouncer. Don't have a good feeling about it,1
Those two leg stump full tosses should‚Äôve been put away,1
Imagine not sending Gayle for a super over,1
Why did he get Hooda in then wtf,11
I love how Rohit knows how much of a cheat code he has with Bumrah. MI have cracked the code for super overs with Bumrah and Hardik on their team.,12
Bumrah yorkers are unplayable,3
atleast one big dick six man,1
If you're turning down a single in a super over you shouldn't have sent the other guy in at all,19
dick KL denied a run,13
"Shit batting, balls like this should be punished",7
3 fulltosses missed.,3
I think Jordan wanted to get in the line of the ball without looking suspicious but fucked up.,7
MI to win on 2nd ball with a Pollard 100m six,4
Shami will give away this much on his first delivery,4
 TRP rating goes down. IPL writers *hold my beer*,13
Neesham brought all his new Zealand bad luck to punjab.,21
I don't even feel anything now. I am numb to all this pain,13
"Rahul man, these runs don't count towards orange cap",2
Good luck defending 8 runs vs Pollard and fuckboi,17
full toss are going to singles.,9
Why does the bowl always go to the substitute fielder lol,6
Ankul Roy is a tank on the field.,7
Chad Bumrah vs Virgin KL.,16
"KL & Pooran don't perform in super overs. Wtf, dude",8
Big balls rahul üòÆ,4
5 all out.,9
Hooda looked more comfortable against Bumrah than Rahul tbh.,7
Man i feel really bad for KL,8
Outtt,2
"Super over: *exists

Teams: This is some serious gourmet shit",9
Bumrah is GOAT,8
"Kohli and Dhoni arguing as to who got white hair on beard first...

meanwhile KL Rahul, ""bitch please""",13
FOCK dizz shizz,0
Poor choice,2
We had so many super overs already this year.,3
Absolute fucking state. They deserve the loss now.,6
Do superover wickets count in purple cap??,8
Kl rahul india aja bhai,10
"Shitty fuckin score again, damn.",8
I still can't get over that stupid ass running from Jordan,11
Bumrah op,4
How much did rcb get in super over?,0
Damn that's fucked,0
"First Lockie, and now Trenty may very well end up being in the winning of the super over. Holy shit, we are get rid of this shitty curse agianst us. Black Caps to win the 2023 WC",6
The other superover today also had 2 wickets.,2
Fuck yes,1
Bumrah with an unofficial fifer!,6
KL has no tactical awareness.,6
"Pooran and Super Over! Definitely a worse love story than Twilight. Remember, he was also the batsman back in 2014 who allowed Sunil Narine to get a maiden over during a super over. Ross Taylor played one of those 6 balls after Pooran got out on the 5th ball.",5
Man KXIP is cursed.,5
One doubt. Does the wickets in superover count for the purple cap?,3
Rahul denying the Run as if he'd have hit 2 sixes,4
Bumrah got KL twice in one match.,11
Another sad super over,8
i like this roy guy,3
DRS timer there is the ultimate troll,19
"I'm crying seeing KL's face, he's shattered beyond repair :(",56
Damn bro.... Feeling sad for kl....he is out there giving his best.,26
Bumrah clutch as fuck,14
Braindead batting,2
Kings XI Bottlejob,4
Bumrah is pure gold,3
KL is dead inside,9
A year to forget for KXIP,3
Bumrah too fucking OP,3
Shami to get hit for a 6 first ball,7
KXIP should've won this :(,4
Sab mile hue hain,10
KL looks like he's done with KXIP,13
[deleted],7
"Poor Punjab, 2nd super over they‚Äôve flopped in",9
I feel bad for Rahul,4
"KL RAHUL after tonight's match - ""Strike rate is over-rated in super over.""",6
"Polly hitting Shami for a six, first ball.
Yes you heard it first here !",6
KL Rahul really needs a therapist after every Punjab match.,25
"If as an Indian, you're not happy seeing Bumrah back in his best",5
Brainfade Rahul.,6
Bumrah is too op,1
Our Indian cricket is in good hands for another 4-5 years.,4
BRO WHERE TF IF GAYLE AND MAYANK...WTF IS KXIP DOING...WHYYYYYYYYY,4
"Super over, more like mini over, amirite?",4
Anyone with Bumrah is finished comments? Koi bhi?,2
No boundary so far in 3 overs of superover today.,4
reverse sweep? brain.exe stopped working?,3
KL needs to leave KXIP and come to DC. No pressure,4
KL got the first-hand experience why it is so fucking hard to score against Bumrah,3
Damn feel sad for Rahulüò≠,9
how are half your balls full tosses and then they only make 5. Idk if it‚Äôs KXIP being mediocre or MI being lucky,3
Disband Kxip pls.,5
[deleted],-3
KL looks already lost,4
Wtf man. Kings should dissolve their team and rename their entire franchise.,2
How can you give your wicket twice to the same bowler in the same fuckin match to the same type of delivery.,4
"""What is the intent?"" Colourised 2020.",10
What is a factory shot lol,2
Sums up the day for poor Rahul.,2
Should have reviewed it for the lulz.,8
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.,2
Punjab didn‚Äôt even have to take it the super over,3
BUMRAH is a cheat code.,10
C H A D,2
Can't see Kl Rahul sad.. :(,5
"Lockie 3+2, Bums 3+2",7
Bumrah you fucking cheat code.,8
Rahul will have depression after this stint,6
"No point in the review there, we still don't have a rule that allows runs in case of over turned reviews anyways.

Plus Plumb!",2
Bumrah the Super over SPECIALIST. No one can match him.,5
Bumrah is number 1.,0
I‚Äôve lost all my respect for Kumble(if anything was there in the first place) by sending Hooda over Gayle,4
Rahul is dead inside,7
Why didn't he review it?,2
"full on chutiyapanti man, also lodu umpires lost punjab this match",2
Man KL's body language helps no one,8
Good to see Boom Boom getting into top gear before the big series down under. He started very rusty in the tournament but looks like he got his mojo back.,5
KL looks like a broken man.,7
Punjab are the Tottenham Hotspur of ipl,3
Pooran becomes the first batsman to get out on Golden Duck twice in the Super Over in the same season of the IPL. He's also the only batsman to score a pair of ducks in the same T20 match.,15
"U cannot deny a single in a super over.
There are 3 batters, each should be equally capable of batting. Each run matters. Don't forget the super over happened because of 1 run. Insane !",9
Why is there an ugly star on my screen,4
Kl doesnt really wanna play,9
Christ,1
KL trying to play a multiplayer game in a singleplayer mode,10
Ngl very depressing watching his face,5
Should have tried Buttler Scoop,2
"Yes, Rahul, because every run is not important, right? Why send a batsman at 3 if you don't trust him to score the most runs?",10
Feel so sad for KL. His team‚Äôs doing everything to let him down,7
"Bumrah, De Kock, Boult, Rohit and Pollard all on the same team is like an all-star team.",5
Feeling sad for Rahul,3
Bumrah Yorkers converted to full tosses ain't easy to hit due to angle and dip,5
Bumrah is a monster.,3
Lmao did the ump give him a little 'on your way son' kind of head nod,6
Oooo bumrah,2
MI and DC are winning matches from unwinnable positions,8
A super over against MI is just a delayed win for MI,11
KXIP does not deserve KL Rahul.,5
Roy should be in the team as a fielding specialist,2
all full tosses should have been 15-20 runs over.,1
Bumbrah justifying his name there. Amazing bowling.,1
"KL had given up even before the ball was bowled.

That was a shot of no-confidence. He had lost his confidence in hitting regular shots against Bumrah.",7
I fear for KL 's mental state at the end of this IPL,9
"Rahul on suicide watch.

Somebody take care of him.",10
Bumrah and Lockie Ferguson have had almost an identical match. 3 wickets + 2 in super over. Probably Bumrah would also be MOTM,5
Today feels like a day where I have eaten just too much chocolate cake and I am continuing to eat more,4
Wtf man. There were 3 full tosses and they couldn't even hit one out of the park. What is it? Are they intimated coz pf bumrah or what?,5
"Lol, imagine if pant did that. Obviously, there's no criticism if you're from Karnataka",4
"I hope KL recovers from all this depression. We need him at his best in the blues. 

I legit feel really bad from KL honestly. Man has done little wrong with the bat.",10
KL needs therapy,6
Thank fuck for mega auctions. This team will make the next 5 IPL‚Äôs a snooze fest.,6
Has MI ever lost a super over since Bumrah joined the team ?,4
KXIP is full of braindead people.,3
Oh boy Kings you've got a lot of work to do,1
Kl is dead inside and outside and also in the other dimensions and parallel universe too.,7
That's a visual depiction of KPLD if I have ever seen one,1
Six Fucking Yorkers.,2
"Insert \*Mein Expert hoon, Mujhe sab kuch Pata hai\* meme here..... Goddamn KL...",3
Do the wickets in a superover count for the purple cap?,1
Rahul going through breakdown,1
Can that denied single be the difference?,3
6 runs is a very tricky score to chase,1
kl rahul this season must be one very frustrated bloke,6
"Okay, Rahul is the official tragic hero of this IPL season. 
Give that good man a crown of thorns!",7
"Gayle I understand, not a great runner. But why not Mayank?",9
Ball 6 should be a bouncer to surprise Rahul.,1
"They bowl shami its done within the first 2 balls, as good as shami is he is not good at death",6
Who would in the right fucking mind would try to scoop bumrah bowling with that angle?,0
Both Bumrah and Ferguson took 3 wickets their spell and 2 during the Super Over on the same day. Coincidence?,7
"Please send Pollard (on strike) along with Hardik, Rohit at 3",1
Are Bumrah full tosses difficult to play for some reason ?,2
Bumrah MOTM,2
Really feel for KL. Done so much for this team and continuously let down by the others,5
MI vs SRH superover Bumrah VS Kanos. SCENES,1
It should've been Gayle and Pooran with Myank next. Stupid ass decision caused them this over,1
Watch shami bowl a wide now.,2
"Ran 30% extra, still didn't make it",3
Pooran and KL got out to Bumrah twice today lmfao,0
KLPD Rahul,0
"It hurts me to see KL so upset despite the fact that I am supporting MI for some reason

KL really deserves better",10
Haha Jordan probably trying to mess up the throw,2
4(4) SR DOESNT MATTER,-2
This is the fourth match kxip lose which they should have easily won. Unless Shami does the impossible?,5
jordan ran 5 extra metres to be run out by inches.,5
"Sorry, but the entire responsibility is on Jordan. Wtf bro. Why?",7
I‚Äôm pissed with Pooran honesty. Everytime same shit.,6
"Has there been a decent super over score yet?? I only remember the scores from today and when Rabada took 2 wickets, and they've all been very low",2
Lol jordon ran 5 meter extra,3
What the fuck Jordan,3
Pollard Rohit or Rohit De cock,1
Rahul has a Savior Complex,3
I hope another team buys KL. KXIP has something wrong and he is too good a player to fade away due to mental health issues,7
The highest score batting first in 4 super overs this year has been 7.,5
Rahul thought he could hit two sixes off Jasprit fucking Bumrah when he didn't allow that second run.,5
"Bumrah almost defended 8 against AB and Kohli, he is a beast in super overs.",8
It would have improved my mood if KL had taken a drs,2
Last time I saw any Indian hitting Bumrah for six with ease was Rishabh Pant,4
"Poor KL, he didn't deserve this",3
17m pitch and Jordan ran 22m,9
"Now that we have already been eliminated from this tournament, play with this lineup - Gayle, Mayank, KL, Mandeep, Pooran, Hooda, Neesham, Bishnoi, Shami, Porel, Arsh.",3
Lol KL denied strike to Hooda and he himself fu*ked up,1
It seems KL Rahul has already given up,2
Depressing AF,1
Mi knew they have the game them moment it went into superover. You just can't get the better of Bumrah in a superover.,5
How was that leg stump ball not a wide. Hooda barely moved one stump.,3
Bumrah is such a legend. I used to worry about no balls but he's gotten better about them. Just pure class,4
Needed batsman in good touch like AB to get those full balls from Bumrah away,2
Punjabi is cursed lmao. Feel really bad for Rahul tho.,2
"I wanna ask, if gayle came what would have been the differencs?",4
"Absolute shit running from Jordan, ran 5 meters extra for no reason at all.",7
Lara lol. Dugout is peak shithousery.,7
Jordan the dumbest person on the planet,5
Do you feel bad for KL ? Well imagine being Needham rn .,3
Lol Lara,2
KXIP is a depressing team to watch,6
Fifer* for bumrah,4
Jasprit times call for Jasprit measures.,10
Bruh Lara‚Äôs imitation of that run...,3
How do you not put away the full tosses providing on the first 3 balls,2
1 boundary and its over,2
Now that decision from Rahul to refuse the second looks even stupider.,3
Mother's Milk should've ran properly,4
"Looks like Rahul has already given up... C'mon man, there are still 6 deliveries to be bowled",10
KL Rahul is the captain. How is Hooda out there batting if KL doesn't trust him to take strike?,6
Kings XI is cursed.,6
KXIP has been the most entertaining team this season hands down,3
I feel like Jordan was tryna obstruct the throw,5
Basically Jordan is creates super overs that end in a losing cause,6
KXIP are cursed to not finish games.,6
Absolutely dejected Rahul :(,5
same like last match,3
This is poorans best ever super over lol,6
Inb4 Shami bowls a no ball,3
Still trying to get over that Chris Jordan running.....,6
BRIAN LARA IS A LEGEND,3
Watch Shami get cunted first ball by Brohit,3
I honestly don't want to be in the opposite camp of bumrah. Don't remember saying that for any indian player,3
This dugout is sooo fun.,1
Hardik the last airbender,6
So Chris Jordan ran for 22m instead of 17-18m. Could have easily sealed it.,5
Wtf is that hairstyle by Hardik,5
Man KL is tired of this shit,2
"Bumrah just showed up and bowled 6 yorkers like it was nothing. LMAO, this Mumbai side really needs a serious nerf.",4
"How good is Jasprit Bumrah, absolutely amazing. Top stuff from the champion bowler.",7
Lmao lara.,2
Should have won in normal time man. You don't win against MI in super over.,3
"Rohit is so lucky to have players like Pandya brothers, Pollard, Bumrah.",-1
I'm still kinda blaming how shit Jordan ran that second run off the last ball. That was an easy 2 there.,3
[I told you so](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jdf9xx/match_thread_36th_match_mumbai_indians_v_kings_xi/g98i1sn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3),-1
Bouncer from Shami first up,1
"Imo the over Bumrah bowled in the super over vs Rcb was way better than this one,it was just some pathetic batting from kxip",3
BC this Mumbai side can even win the 20 over and 50 over world cups.,7
Bowling Bumrah and batting Pollard and Pandya in the super over should be illegal,3
2 balls 2 wickets 2nd innings Shami,4
Pollard is going to hit a six off the first ball just to troll Punjab.,1
I don't get people blaming Rahul here. He tried his best. There was no way anyone could have scored against this bowling,4
Now I am scared for KL. Please someone take care of him.,5
Rahul loses hope so early.,3
Was jordan running like that to get in way of the throw.,2
WTF is a factory shot Sunny???,3
MI is insanely lucky to get this world class bowler,1
Feels bad for rahul stuck with a shit team,7
Can someone put them out of their misery please,1
That no wide call was disgraceful to say the least.,1
"Could fourth innings shami save them? Jordan made 2 big mistakes, not doing the tuk and run on the last ball of 19th over and running that extra mile while trying to turn.",7
Choke choke choke üòãüòãüòã,1
KL made a Maxwell like mistake. Could have played something more conventional instead of that,2
So many dull super overs this year!,4
[deleted],2
Hardik Pandya looks a fucking idiot.,10
"Normal commentary: r/cricket

Dugout commentary: r/cricketshitpost",15
Kumble and Kohli battling to prove who the real fraud is.,6
Imagine being under so much pressure you can't hit full tosses,6
"Bumrah 3 full tosses, 2 runs and a wicket. Probably the fear he instills in batters",3
"KXIP goes to super over with two of the best bowlers Rabada (DC) and Bumrah (MI).

Gayle should have batted.,5
"Petition to resolve KXIP.. and to never have any team with the word ""punjab"" in it.",2
"I really missed Chris Gayle in the super over , feels awful now",4
"Jokes aside. Seeing Rahuls expression I honestly wonder how IPL plays on the psyche of such players. Yes they make their money, they play their cricket but the constant pressure of performing as both a player and a captain must be hard.",28
So would it be considered a 5fer for BUMRAH?,5
Rahul is such a choker.,-5
KL seems like the kinda guy who cuts himself after every loss,5
Damn that was a bad super over.. not as bad as earlier game.. but still bad.,9
"For those who don't understand Jordan's running, he was trying to get in between the throw by Polly.",2
4 out of the 6 balls went to Anukul lol.,6
2 super overs in a day has to be fixed,2
KL should stop being so sad. He has done his job. Indian cricket is more imp than IPL,14
"Opinion: Super over should make 2 bowlers bowl 3 balls each.

Having only 1 best death baller and 4 other shitty bowlers should be penalized",3
What's weird is Boomrah didn't even bowl that well in super over.,6
[deleted],3
It was 4D chess by Jordan. He wanted to wink at the face of The umpire so that he doesn't give him bouncer warning in next matches.,4
Can we have a petition to ask MI to give Anukul Roy a game,8
Which script is better IPL or EPL.,3
"How I read points table:
MI, DC, nobody, nobody, nobody, RCB, rest",4
I'm predicting a second super over,13
This team is so fucking useless,2
Nic Pooran in Super overs this season. 0(1) amd 0(1).,3
Don't let these super over shenanigans distract you from the fact that Jordan had a chance to win the game for KXIP if he had run on a straight line instead of taking a 3 kilometre radius turn.,14
Someone tell KXIP that they have to score just one run above what the opposition has scored lmao,3
Bring back bowl outs,5
Circumcised Hardik,5
I don't think Rahul wants to continue playing for k11p,4
Why did they not send Gayle?,4
Wasnt the best super over i've seen bowled from Bumrah,3
"Shami will try,  Short pitch, slower one, cutter and save yorker for the last ball",2
Maybe there's some second innings Shami magic,3
Man we didn't put away 4 full tosses,1

It was a wide. Fucking bought umpires!!!!,4
Cottrell with the sad boi vibes,6
Rohit should bat,1
If this match can be saved its upto Shami!,2
If Mumbai get 5/1 will they win or it will be a tie,4
Pooran basically blew up both the super overs he got this season,5

Can't Shami just bowl 5wd and get it over with,6

4 fucking fulltoses missed in the super over.,10
ootl whats mothers milk,1
How do you stop supporting a team which you have been doing since the first season?,4
I am a simple man I just want a MI v DC super over. Rabada and Bumrah bowling ah the dream,13
"lol Shami, one ball finish",2
Just wanna slap the shit out of Kumble‚Äôs face for not sending Gayle. No wonder Kohli kicked him out.,8
This ain‚Äôt on Rahul and honestly if you blame Jordan you‚Äôre scapegoating maxwell and co,6
Why you can‚Äôt use same batsmen or bowlers next time?,1
"This is what happens to a team when they are being led by shits like Kumble and Rahul.
I would love to hear pro Kumble voices.",2
Kumble coming in to bowl,2
It‚Äôs unfair to blame rahul on this. The lone wolf in this innings and does everything he can but his team does shitty things like not running between the wickets properly,6
That (not) wide down the leg side in the last over could have won the match for Punjab,2
"It's decided. KL is the rightful successor to Kohli. 

‚Ä¢ Questionable captaincy choices. 

‚Ä¢ Bats with Gayle. 

‚Ä¢ Scores runs like a demi god while his franchise gets a wooden spoon.

Bumrah also took 5 wickets today like Lockie,5
Rohit looks like he's going out to bully k11p,1
"Jordan ran 22 metres, shortest distance is 17m. Still didn't make it",7

"I'm sorry but not sending Gayle in a fuckin superover is just criminal, no matter what you say

"Shami is the worst for super overs.
Short stuff isn't what's needed. You need yorkers.",6
What a waste of a fantastic chase üòî,8
KL looks spent man. Such a class act but looks like he is tired of doing it alone.,7
wow how awesome would another super over be,4
All this comes down to Jordan not being able to run straight.,5
Ambani camp visitors are all fat fucks.,5
Chris Jordan must be feeling so stupid right now. Shit turn and didn't put in a dive,6
Why de cock? Where's pollard?,2
"Openers coming out lol, looks like a completely new match has begun",7
I really wanna see Rohit cunt one out the ground like he did earlier this year against NZ in that super over,6
I think if a game goes to a super over the winning team should get 2 points and losing team should get 1 point. Feels harsh to tie and then get nothing out of it,11
I used to feel the same way for Kohli like I'm feeling for KL now.,5
"Genuine Q. Why didnt Gayle bat super over?

Edit : fixed mistake",7
Rohit not repeating the same mistake of the previous super over.,2
tbh none of the bottom 4 really have a chance unless KKR botches it,8

are those wickets in super over are considered for purple cap?,4
Things would be so much better if these motherfuckers would trust Agarwal. Ffs earlier too they did this.,13

Punjab deflated already,2

How many close games have they bottled",5

I'd love to see them get 5 and go to another super over just so that we can see 3 super overs in one day because why not at this point.,3
I just want to see msd once leaving balls in a super over while I enjoy the gazillion comments on r/cricket,27
Don‚Äôt understand why KL didn‚Äôt go for that second run,1
"After this year's IPL, KL Rahul might just retire from super overs lol",8
"lmao imagine Anil Kumble: ""Fuck it i'l bowl in the super over"".. guy looks genuinely pissed",12

KXIP IS SO SHIT. THEY CANT EVEN WIN A FIXED MATCH.,3
"This IPL has taken 5 years off Rahul's life, 2 off punjab's fans. Given 3-4 to maxxi tho",59
What happens if the super over gets tied too?,6
Kumble will probably have to come out of retirement and captain the side to turn things around,10
meanwhile rohit reminding umpire his 'duties',10

KXIP yet to score a boundary in super over this season. They have faced two super overs.,5

Quinton has his trademark guard-taking technique.,1
I feel the final's gonna be a super over with Bumrah bowling one end and Rabada bowling one end. One can always dream.,6
I only follow KXIP due to the banter they provide. They really are fun to watch as a neutral,5
Only way to win is to get the wickets. No way they play 6 balls and don't get these,4
Knowing KXIP this is gonna be first ball 6,3
Someone tell Mumbai we're not starting a new match,14
Aaa. Single.,3
I love a super over but man do they take so bloody long,9
"Lol, you have 6 runs to defend with Shami bowling! Do you even need to worry whos batting?!",7
When Bumrah is bowling hard for even the best to hit. Love the strategy. Inswinging yorkers with fielders at fine leg boundary.,2
They need dots and wickets.,3
Factory shot lmao,3
There should be a time limit on how much time teams can waste in between all these Super Overs etc. too much now.,2
Would've been wide if he left that.,2
"I'm concerned KL will start playing like this for India , just too much shit",-2

Can‚Äôt even use your third batsman in the repeated super over? If he doesn‚Äôt come out to bat in the first one that is,3
QDK must be a big fan of Tarantino films. With all that obsession with the leg side.,12
Wtf is even a factory shot?,11
Maxwell is such a colossal cunt,13
Why can‚Äôt people play normal in a super over. Why play hard and try all sorts of random shots. Bhai net practice m karle jo karna.,15
Sunny G: ‚ÄúFactory Shot‚Äù,11
Feel for Rahul. His back and head must hurt immensely after games like these. A supportive innings with intent with a couple more players is all that is needed to win,16
QDK trying to force a shot towards Gayle lol,5
What the fuck is a factory shot sunny G. Fuckin boomer can't shut up with his passive aggressiveness,13

Damn justhit it rohit,1
jesus. 3 from 3.,9
Ok who has more boundaries?,12

  **factory method pattern** is a  [creational pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern) that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of [creating objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_creation) without having to specify the exact [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) of the object that will be created.

The universe wanted the universe boss to bat a superover. This is what happens now.,4
So happy for Shami...he is so underrated compared to Bumrah.,6

4D chess from KXIP saving Gayle for this final massive over,5
Thank God i slept in the afternoon during SRH batting,4
What is 2020 lmao,3

Shami OP!!!!,3
"They can't use Pollard lmao, Chris Gayle sitting out turns out to be a masterstroke",10
Shit they accidentally put the line about super over twice in the script.,12

Jimmy nishcem can't catch a break lmao,6

Nahi nahi tum lo.
Arey nahi tum lo mere bhai.
Maine kahana tum lo.",6
So who has more boundry's /s,5
Can you imagine the scenes if Maxwell comes out to bat and wins it for KXIP... lmaoooo please make this happen.,4
With bumrah out.... Punjab has advantage,6
"Honestly don‚Äôt care about the result now, kxip has played a good super over lol I‚Äôll take that",3
This is what Neesham wanted in 2019,6
"Bumrah bowls 4 fulltosses and gets away with it. Shami bowls brilliantly and defends 5. 
Dugout: sHaMi Is nO bUmRaH",9
"India's premier bowlers on display, great bowling by both Bumrah and Shami",5
"As an Indian fan, how good are our top bowlers. Under pressure and bowling like machine. Maza aa gaya yaar",11
"Surely just tell them to bowl the next over straight away, why are we waiting so long?",6
Man I don't care who wins but kumble sitting down and clapping in slow motion is absolute box office. Reminded me of a hyper patriotic Hollywood movie,9
"Batsman - Hardik, Surya and Krunal whereas KXI sends Gayle, Mayank and Maxwell.

Bowlers - Boult from MI and Jordan from KXI?

Money still on MI with the actual power hitters",6
"Who choked harder? MI,KXIP or Piper Peri.",6

Jordan with ball,2

Punjab have neither 3 batsmen nor a decent over. F,2
boundary count?,2
"MI played 3D chess since they know there will be another super over and save the best for last. Now they unleash their real specialists in Pollard and Hardik. Boult will bowl.

KXIP used all their best in 1st one. They have hit me anywhere Jordan in the tank. :)",6
Polly cant bat. Stupid rule. brb calling Ambani to deal with it.,4
2 off 1 is harder than 4 off 1 cant stress this enough,10
3 Super Overs bruh,4
"POLLARD PANDYA

Nvm",1
So no bumra,1
Moment of slience for those who don‚Äôt watch cricket.,3
Exceptional by Shami. Just nailed 6 yorkers,3
So neither team can get 3 off 3... What a circus.,3
Pandyas and Kishan?,3
I believe Punjab has better batsmen in this round,1
Rohil 1 run 3 ball . What a shit,-1
"They won't show the replay, should that guy have saved the 1?",1
Looks like there's some debate over whether Pollard can bat,1
Feel like Punjab have the advantage here considering who's remaining.,2
"If this gets tied again, they will play a test match starting from tomorrow and it won't be 5 days but will go on till we get a result.",4
If I shout anymore they‚Äôll put me in an asylum...,2
Shami was their only bowler. Who else can bowl lol,2
IPL makes it so hard sometimes to believe it isn't scripted.,1
Suddenly saving Gayle seems like a masterstroke,3
Who bowls for punjab!!,3
And this is the match between #2 and #8. Who would have thought this would be so close?,2
Players who have played in the previous super over cannot play in this one.,2
Fuck sleep,2
Jordan/KL run out,1
Just give 1 point to Kxip and 1 to Mi and fucking move on.,3
"I don't even care who wins anymore, I'm just enjoying the fun. WHATTA MATCH",3
"K mi, we got to know it's a prank against a meme team, u can win now",2
so the players participating the first super over can't participate in the second?,6
"Mumbai bottled it. Cmon rohit dude 6 runs, why go for a scoop?",5
Shami is a relieved man,3
Most entertaining game in the history of cricket.,8
I'm going to cry lol... gutted for MI,3
Genuinely thought they would go for higher boundary count,1
What a game!,1
Imo QDK to be blamed. Sunny is right. He ran awfully slow.,1
So is there another super over ?,3
[removed],6
10:20PM at the ground rn. Gate keeper's wife will be furious.,7
Same batsmen and bowlers can't play again!,1
Can pollard bat?,1
"As a neutral, can‚Äôt tell you how much I‚Äôm enjoying this",4
Genuine Q. Was the fuck up on MI or kxip for bringing this match to a super over?,4
Wowzas,1
"What happens if the second super over is a tie

Might as well ask",1
I've said it before. I'll say it again. Send Maxwell you cowards.,2
8D chess from Gayle to win it in the next innings,2
"RULE -. none of the first 6 players used in the first super over can be used in the second super over
-cricbuzz",2
"Did you guys know that Pollard can't bat again? Simon Doull going nuts, but so am I!",7
"I assume

Pollard Hardik SKY and Boult for MI

Gayle Mayank Maxwell and Arsh for KXIP",1
Fuck man you can't make this stuff up.I am gonna have a heart attack.Superover also tied.Another Super Over to follow??WTF is this.,4
Slow first run again when you knew you needed a second,1
"Battle between Bumrah and Shami for 2 points.   
Indian pace attack has  been top class in recent years",5
The same bowler can't bowl the super over again?,3
Give Shami the bat too,3
Someone needs a raise! Beautiful script. XDXD,7
"Gayle, Mayank and Maxi vs Bout


Hardik, Krunal, Sky vs Jordan",3
Holy hell what the fuck is going on?!,2
Quite uncharacteristically dumb from MI,7
not so good running between the wickets costing both teams,3
Incredible from Shami,3
6 Yorkers from Shami this is some dope ass shit,7
3 super overs in 1 day lmao,5
That dismissal off the last ball was a spitting image of the WC Final's last ball.,8
"These incredible 12 balls bowled in these two super overs should make every Indian cricket fan smile.

Bumrah and Shami. You diamonds.

What an era this is for India cricket!",5
"So if none of the players of the first Super Over can play now, incredible 5D strategy by KXIP.",2
4D chess by KXIP by not naming Boss in super first over squad,4
"Wait, the same players cannot play again?",5
"Regardless of who wins, we are Raiding Neesham‚Äôs Twitter",5
What happens if there's another tie after this??,4
Is this the first time we've had 2 super overs?,4

This is FUCKING wild,9
And people with two braincells say IPL is fixed.,6
This should be called Super Duper Over,10
"KXIP: u win

MI: No. u win",15
Who wins on boundary count back?,3
MUMBAI DRESSING ROOM LOOKING DEJECTED,3
"In case anyone's interested, MI would have won by boundary count, if rules hadn't changed",5
"Now that there is no responsibility on Rahool , he will relax and attain nirvana and punjab will  LwOiSnE",4
What the fuck is happening! Holy hell! This IPL is mad!,5
Who bats now?,5
Fuck every team is a meme team at this point (._.),3
If Jordan bowls our super over then we are fucked,4
Time for some boult PTSD,3
Like watching a penalty shootout - great scenes.,3
Bumrah = Shami. What terrific bowling from these two.,5
All because of that man Neesham.,8
"24 boundaries by MI

22 by KXIP

thank god the rule doesn't exist",11
Punjab is keeping the tournament alive tonight,7
This gives me immense pleasure both Shami and Bumrah are at their peak in superover!,7
Would love to see a 4th super over where Bumrah and Shami have to bat. Advantage KXIP.,11
ae.. ye kya chod failayela hai idhar,0

We need to bring back the Bowl-out in case of tie in super over,1

Can they make 1 of 3 though? They have fucked it up before.,1
KXIP have anti-KXIPed themselves here.,2
"MI will look and rue missed chances. 

Too many catch drops and absolute bottlejob while chasing 6 runs first time. 

Should have sent Pollard the first time itself.. 

2nd time with Gayle and no Bumrah, it was tough ask and with low score, it sealed the deal",3

Agrawal on strike. 1 off 3. Where have I seen this before!,1
T20 is not entertaining because of sixes. But because margin for errors are so small. Learn that in this ipl,2
So we're back where we started Mayank with 1 to win off 3,1
"If this is another tie, Zinta and Ambani will play in next superover.",8
The script writer should do a SRK movie next!!,1
"Preity ""schoolgirl"" Zinta. 

Could pass as Rahul Chahar's sister with that weird hairdo.",5
Should have been Mayank instead of Hooda and we would have gone to sleep early,5

Unbelievable finish,6
"If there is someone out there who deserves to be in the Blues for India, no one deserves it more than Agarwal for sure",9
Imagine watching this in a stadium,9

At this point I don't care cricket wins,8
"Nothing gets better than that 2016 t20 WC final. But, fuck this was up there! Lions Roar",7
I can't imagine being a punjab fan. The sheer fluctuation from euphoria to depression and back is just too much to handle. Mad respect for you all.,11
Life is not so overrated after all,6
See SRH? That's how you play a fucking super over,9
Boult is useless in super overs,8
OMGGGGGG! I had resigned to being happy with running MI so close,5
"I love that when KXIP win they still manage to make it as memeable as possible, what a fucking match",11
Preity being happy is everything,6
I am mentally drained....OMG. well played KXIP I guess,9

Is that girl Mayank's wife???,1
Inb4 3dots,3
"I told you, Agarwal is the man.",18
"Man gotta give credit to Gayle. Cool as ice, smokes the first ball for six. Whatta game.",22
Man didn't knew gangul hired Abbas mustan for this year scripting of ipl,12
"Well played boys... As a MI supporter, I'm happy KXI won this. Keeps the tournament open. 

Also, well played MI to bring yourself back in the game.",11

What the actual fuck! What a game,6
Mayank agrawal MoM for that save and those boundaries,6
This has given me PTSD just like the NZ WC final,3
"I fucking love Gayle.

Didn't smile or celebrate. Probably cared more that the ball cleared the fielder so he didn't have to run than about winning the game.",29
MI is the new meme team,0
Fuccccck man i love cricket,7
Are we in some alternate timeline.,4
"Although I support MI, it's good to see a smiling KL.",7
Holy crap what a game. Amazing Sunday.,3
This will turning point in our journey. We won't choke anymore.,4
Mumbai Indians‚Äô cockiness cost the match. Should have sent Pollard and Hardik together in first Super Over.,8
What a game !,3
"My god , what have I witnessed",3
FUCK YEAH KXIP!!!!,4
I only watch Punjab for Gayle now! We were stupid to release him,5
IPL should definitely ban UNIVERSE BOSS,4
A well deserved win. KL rahul deserves this the most.,5
@ KXIP Supporters: Naacho BC!!,3
There is nothing more interesting than a KXIP game.,8
"Good win Punjab. MI will not be too disappointed though, they're still the best side in the tournament.",4
PUNJAB TO CARRY THE MOMENTUM FORWARD AND WIN THE WHOLE THING,9
"not been watching IPL the last few seasons, but has this been the best season ever so far?

Excellent close matches, not dominated by any single team, chases with never-give-up attitudes, some vintage players and some new finds..

And now capped with 3 super overs in a day",15
"I started watch at 21yo, I am now 27",16
Happy for KL,6
Damn!Gotta love this sport!!,1
I've never seen Boult defend a super over,8
Gayle looks 60.,3
THIS IS AWESOME!,1
Imagine this match being played in front of a live audience,27
genuine Q. Pollar usually dives and stuff for the balls right? But he gave up even running before it hit boundary? Why tho? Wasn't it crucial at?,3
Mayank what a batsman,3
Motabhai.exe has stopped working.,0
What's with super overs and NZ bowlers?,3
Happy to see KL Happy,9

What a game!!! I'm not even sad that we lost. Don't know why.,7
"Called it, wow what a day. KKR winning and MI losing, with 3 super overs. Awesome",11
Is that girl KXIP crying there? Yesterday GMR's grandson spouting 'fuck off' after 'fuck off' and today this. Making up for lack of crowd reactions in these close games.,21
"Finally KXIP catch a break; fucking awesome. They earned it.

What a day for T20 cricket.",12
Nachooooooo,3
Some trash from Boult in the end there,5
Kumble - I am out of Valium. Can I have a refill,6
Gayle totally outsmarted us today ‚ù§Ô∏è,14
KXIP is 6th. I repeat KXIP is 6th,21
"No one expected Shami to metamorphose into Bumrah-Lite and tie the super over.  
As for the rest, once Gayle had pumped Boult for a six, the outcome was more or less decided.  
   
Regardless of how they finish this season KXIP should try and retain the core of this team. Experiences like this really go a long way in instilling belief and camaraderie",25
Fuck you MI!,17
Now MI is an RCB tier team.,10
Rohit played absolutely dog shit this match.,12
The highlights of this game were supposed to be posted on r/bdsm. Now they'll be posted on r/maybemaybemaybe,15

What a day! One of the greatest days of IPL cricket,21
What a match. Absolutely incredible.,12
i hate cricket,1
Took 6 super over overs to see an over that was played like a super over should,15
I would have sent mayank in the first super over ..he is really an awesome player,10
"*Mumbai have lost a game they should have won* - Sunny G

Well well guess who is biased.",30
Boult PTSD.,10
How would the interaction between a fielding coach and Gayle be,6
"BRILLIANT FROM THE MAYANK, THAT FIELDING AND THEN THE FINISH... UFFF",13

Is Pollard the real captain?,7

"So many big points but the bigger one was De Kock and Rohit not being able to score 6 runs in 6 balls, that aside KXIP starting their MI run of losing matches in first half and qualifying anyway?",11
That was so inspiring from kxip. Won't mind a DC loss next game. KXIP deserves it. Lol,14
MI finally lost a game,9

Absolute s c e n e s,6
"Universe boss saving 2020!

Im happy as a MI fan, that we got to witness 2 super over in a match which was lost with they way KL was batting. I'm glad though KL will get some peace of mind. Need him at his top form for the National team.",5
What a game this has been! This is probably the best Sunday in IPL history.,18
"Rahul before match: I have seen 14 million possibilities and only won in one.

Super over 1: infinity war


Rahul sacrifices himself and not sending Gayle 
: there was no other way (gets bowled)

Goliath vs David this match.,5
Never give a new zealander responsibility for a super over,19
best t20 game ever.,9
Fuck. This is the most intense t20 match I've ever watched.,12
Still don't know how kane bowled Bout over Ferguson in the wc final.,11
Surely you can score 6 runs in one over,5
Has Gayle‚Äôs beard turned white during this game ?,3
"Final: RCB v/s KXIP
KXIP wins and Gayle lifts the trophy. Kohli and AB celebrate anyway with there ex teammates and they all sing, ""It's RCB which won""",8
"Guys just imagine if this would've been the IPL final. The nerves. Seriously this match could be considered one of the best T20 matches in years. Fuckin' IPL, Gotta love every moment.",16
It would be cool and weird if the ground staff closed the doors of the stadium and all the players inside had to sleep on the ground till daylight. I feel like Chahal would agree to this.,12

Thank fuck KXIP won,6
That save by Mayank on the boundary was the best piece of fielding i have seen ever!,12

Mayank to Replace VADAPAO Sharma as Opener?,5
Don't mean to offend anyone but I'd be a bit happier if MI loses the  next 2-3 games too. Would make for a interesting 3rd and 4th place chase,11
Mayank the MVP!!!!!,12
It's criminal that MI will be going empty handed from this match. I still think that points should be shared and super overs should only be in knockouts,-9
"As a MI fan, this is not that bad. It took a great deal of effort to beat us. Also, now if tomorrow  RR wins then CSK will be at the bottom of table.",9
Mayank is a clutch player,15
MI played 2 matches in Dubai and both went to super overs,9
Biggest fight ever for 2 points. Not sure how KL would feel if they would have lost. Exhausting win by KXIP,13
Happy KL is good to see. Dude was looking dead inside before,13
KXIP fought Incredibly well,9
KL Rahul deserved this victory. Would've been a travesty by the Universe if they lost this one..,16
The amount of shit posting I have done during this match is unparalleled.,17
"Why get NCN if Boult is your second choice superover bowler? 

What degree of hubris did it take for Rohit to send himself ahead of everyone else in the batting lineup(pretty much all of whom were in better hitting form)? 

Good on Punjab for winning, but this defeat is going to sting",10
"Man for some reason I feel so happy seeing Gayle, KL smiling. Really hope they somehow qualify for eliminator.",17
Have to give credit to Mi 2 out of 3 matches they lost they lost in SUper Over. I think other teams now know how to beat MI.,19
"bc I am 60 years old now,will be telling about this match to my grand kids.",30
Fuck what's this exhaustion that I am feeling even though I haven't left from the couch for 2 hours.,40

LOL what were the Pandya brothers doing?? üòÇüòÇ,8
Look at the scream from Mayank they deserve to be in Top 4,17
Hope this gives the confidence to KXIP to go big. Great Win.,11
What a fantastic weekend it has been after boring matches on weekdays. 4 close matches with 3 super overs.,6
Let this be a lesson that you never doubt Gayle. Forget about dropping him!,21
Greatest T20 game ever.!?,10

Just have Mark Nicolas commentate every match. Cricket 07 nostalgia.,11
Mayank was such a sweetheart. Damn dude. That save almost fractured his hand and came back to bat like that. Wow. And that KL runout. This team deserves everything.,85
They did it for my babe Preethi. She happy I am happy üòå,4
"I feel that Nathan was the better option.

Boult was having an off day.",9

It was needed for MI to keep them grounded.,8
Easily the best game of the season so far.. Somebody just handover the trophy to KXIP for this win.. What a fight against one of the very best teams in IPL history.. Beautiful underdog story,13
Biggest fuckup of the match should be Rohit's 1(3) in the super over. Jordan made up for his brainless running in the last ball with a fantastic super over. The 5th ball which Rohit tried to scoop and failed was right in the slot. He could have hit down the V easily.,11
MI does miss a second decent death bowler.,4
I want whatever those scriptwriters are smoking.,12
"all things aside good to see bumrah shami in full rhythm,aus tour gonna be fireeee.",18

"would the batting team have a difficult time to play super overs since only their batsmen are warmed up and probably quite a lot of them have eaten as well? 

Compared to the fielding team where everyone is on the field, all warmed up and doing what they were doing for another over.",4
Script writers are getting cocky here,13
Goddamn Maxwell. How shit do you have to be as a power hitter than they don't even ask you to pad up in a super over,28
Listening to Mark Nichols just soothes my soul as an old cricket guy,8
The scriptwriting has been brilliant so far this season. And the execution is fucking insane.,11

my boy rohit not feeling well :'(,16
MI is probably the strongest team out there for a super over yet they have lost three super overs this season,21
Surely this has to be the record for most amount of comments on a r/cricket post? The World Cup one might come close,14
4 teams on 6 points. The battle of NRR.,19
"KXIP have played the best cricket outside of the top 3 teams, they just keep choking at the end and that is what has hurt them. They have been competitive in most of their games.",17
BENCHOD!!!!,10
Imagine the world cup final going for a second Super Over.,15
Missed the last half an hour after Rahul got out did anything happen?,11
"to be fair,Bumrah's first 3 balls were also full tosses.KXIP batsmen couldn't get a boundary probably coz of the extra pace.With Boult,it was much easier since his pace is much less.Glad that KXIP won though,keeps them alive in the tournament.",14
Uh the points table looking crisp..üí¶,17
"Imagine KXIP get to the playoffs and win the IPL 

Peak 2020.",18
Why isn't anyone talking about why Pollard was allowed to bat in second super over and not Rohit,-2

Best possible result for us,9
"In 2014 MI had lost 5 matches in a row and were at the bottom. They played the top ranked KXIP and beat them.

In 2020 KXIP had lost 6 matches and were at the bottom. They played the top ranked MI and beat them.

Folks.....",30
Performance for the ages. Phew! What a Sunday/Monday we had.,17
On this very thread earlier on I asked how many comments in a t20 match thread and a guy commented 10k sometimes... And now it's 11k+,10
"Cricket is an amazing game but I hate to say people on this thread have a very negative way of looking at things.

Kings win but people choose to make 'fun' of MI players rather than applauding the wonderful game that happened.

And dont even open a CSK thread because that is such a shitshow..

What people should realise that this negativity not only affects them the most but also makes this thread a worse place for cricket lovers and newcommers to be in..

We will be a much better community if we try to focus more on the positives then try to 'laugh' on accomplished people when they fail.

Just my 2 cents..",26
[deleted],21
"3k comments in 4 super overs , some match those has been",16
Everyone upvote the thread so Americans find it & get confused,29
"WHAT DRAMA. We suck at Super Overs though. Really poor from Rohit and Quinny, couldn't chase 6. Two classy batsman trying reverse shots and unorthodox flicks.. like why. Meanwhile absolute class from Bumrah and Shami (plus Jordan too tbh). Gayle and Mayank did the rest.

Well done KXIP.",15
"This match thread is going to be at the museum. It's filled with kock-dick jokes, simping for girls watching the game at the stadium, of course the drama of double super overs.",15
Kings needed three innings to win game.,13
"Mayank is easily one of the most beautiful players to watch in present-day cricket. Just so damn incredible. If only Jinx had the same sort of consistency, we'd see another batsman do similar stuff.",18
So this is what jerking off to stereotypical Punjabi music feels like..,17
[deleted],7
"Lol so many comments, Americans in this thread?üòÇ",14
Now I need DC and RCB to lose.,1
Yuvraj might have gotten a peek at the climax of the script and hence his tweet about KXIP playing the finals. Would be peak 2020 if KXIP wins from here making it a reversal of their 2019 where they won 5/7 matches and still failed to qualify for the playoffs.,14
"Upvote the match thread everyone, this needs to get to r/all",26
"~~spider-man~~ HITMAN : mota bhai,I am not feelin good.",11
There couldve been 4 teams on 8 points cause of this weekend but there are none,12
I'm so happy that Gayle performed and didn't disappoint.,17
"Without Universe Boss - 7 matches 1 win
With Universe Boss - 2 matches 2 wins",28
Excellent match! Can't believe Kings XI actually managed to pull through for a win. If only fans were there. People deserved to see this spectacle live,28
"Fellas upvote this immortal thread, 400 upvotes : 12000 comments is pretty shabby",28
One of the best games of IPL... But it might cause a little pain in the chest bcoz of MI losing it,16
[Thanks for the validation Gayle and Mayank](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jdf9xx/z/g98vawm),15
"Another thing I have said multiple times but Mumbai winning has overshadowed it:

Boult is not a death bowler. Why else do you think we let him go?",9
"This Punjab team is so 2019 RCB. 
Losing first few matches initially. Then winning against top teams in second half of the tournament trying to claw themselves to the playoffs.",25
"**KXIP in IPL**

Wonder if any Americans coming here out of curiosity.,22
Fun fact : New zealanders cannot win a superover,32
"Lets imagine for a second that some people placed a sizeable bet on two super overs occurring in the same match.....

"We witnessed history guys, we witnessed history",38
NZ players and super overs. Name a sadder duo.,38
YOU CANT WIN A GAME WITHOUT BOWLERS AND YOU COULDNT WITHOUT A BOWLER WHO BOWLED SIX FUCKING YORKERS. MAN OF THE MATCH SHOULD BE SHAMI.,27
I wish this thread gets to r/all,13
Swann is so extra lol,13
Like the thread before leaving,10
"Really gotta commend Bumrah. Love how it‚Äôs a given that a Bumrah over will probably yield a wicket and give ~ 6 runs only. Teams have to design their strategies around this fact, can‚Äôt do anything else at this point",24
This ipl is crazy especially punjab matches are always entertaining either they won or lose,16
That superover from Shami is one of the best I've seen. Defending 6 runs in a superover is an incredible feat.,64
Mayank with those clutch moments,12
"Now that the match is done, can we finally clarify why Pollard could bat and Rohit could not?",12
"This shit chatroom: no mention of the guy who won KXIP the game, mohammed shami",37
"Man I love this sport. That's it, that's the comment.",22
give mayank the champagne already for saving that six.,14
Let's get to 15k now guys!,7
Aight ima rub one out and go to sleep now.,29
"Get this to Popular or r/all or whatever it is, everyone. Use dem alts",12
"Also: If KKR lose their next two matches (vs. RCB and DC), the running for #4 becomes pretty interesting again. KXIP actually have a good shot now if they keep up form",13
Replace Maxwell with somebody and Punjab have a damn good chance of making it to playoffs,15
I think playing at neutral venues really spicing this IPL,21
New Zealand would be World Cup winners if they bowled Ferguson instead of Boult in that super over.,15
Great game.,3
Pommie is such a good speaker.,10
Mayank is so wholesome. That is all,23
Too many tactical errors today. Especially that extra over by Pollard.,9
LOLKL: It's not the first time...,9
shami to have a royal hyderabadi biryani after this.,15
Shouldn‚Äôt the gamechanger award go to Mayank for that save because even after Rahuls knock they could have still lost but the difference between the two sides was that save,13
Hurts like hell mannnn,10
"Flair doesn't check out I know,
But I was supporting KXIP throughout just because they were having such a bad time",17

"1) Thank You Chris Jordan, he bent his run a tad and that led to all this.

2) Bumrah‚Äôs over was obviously insane but Shami had surely one of the best super overs ever too? Defending 6 runs under so much more pressure then Bumrah and he was bowling perfect Yorkers too. Credit to Jordan too bowled really well only Boult had poor execution but that‚Äôs a huge situation.",29
"People talking about so much drama in the super over forgetting their roots, dont forget Jordan's runout",11
"So according to the script, MI is going to win the finals in a superover",11
Agarwal is way better player than pooran . Pooran lost his wicket last time too. Agarwal would have scored against bumrah also. Finally happy for punjab.,6
The runout by KL & that save by Mayank were too good.,27

Is it just me or pommy looks so much like Terry crews.,6
Are you not entertained? Join r/kxip and support the most entertaining team of this IPL.,20
I know Punjab have hammered their own foot more than once this season but they're clearly a better side than Kolkata. Would love it if they somehow manage to clinch that fourth spot.,33
"I have a hunch, Punjab will make it into top 4 but not KKR.",12
"With all due respect, Shami should be man of the match. 2-30 and then defending fucking 5 runs.",49
I feel Punjab won it when Mayank saved that six off Pollard. You could clearly see that shift in their body language. Also I feel large part of the excellent 1st Super Over by KXIP was the pep talk that KL Rahul gave at the beginning. I wish I was there to hear that. Could've climbed Everest.,67

This is what lords rules state: 22.1.1¬†If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the definition in 22.1.2, the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the striker standing in a normal guard position.

22.4.1¬†The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving,

either¬† causes the ball to pass wide of him/her, as defined in 22.1.2

or¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by means of a normal cricket stroke.",2
"should the dialogue be changed now? ""haarke jeetne waale ko kings xi punjab kehte hai""?",12
So happy for punjab. Feel for Boult though.,10
"If this shit is scripted, than Pollard & Mayank deserve a fucking Oscar for hitting the ball just perfectly so that Mayank could jump & save it from going for a six",74
I feel playing Gayle and that Pooran 6 lifted our bad luck curse lol. We were the lucky team toady.,21
This was the best match but as an MI supporter I wanna go kms.,24
Cricket won!,9
To excited to sleep now lol,21
"‚ÄúBut but we lost 2 games in the super over‚Äù

Last I checked, super over was part of the game.",9
When Gayle turned to attempt that second run I knew we'd win this.,42
"My preference for the remaining IPL:

 - CSK: need to suffer more. Lose 4/5 preferably.   Win against MI. Dhoni exposed as a fraud.

 - MI: lose 5/5 from here. Exposed badly in the spin department and miss playoffs. 

 - DC: win 7/7.

 - KXIP: semi finalists.

 - RCB: playoffs.

 - SRH/RR: playoffs.

 - KKR: don‚Äôt care. 

Will settle for one of KXIP, SRH, RCB winning the whole thing as compromise.

MI, CSK winning the whole thing is a disaster as always.

RR, KKR winning the whole thing evokes no emotions.",-34
"Covid before 19th Sep: everyone looks sad and worried, I have done my work



Covid after 19th Sep: what the fuck.....",28
I Jumped from.my chair with joy when mayank saved that 6 in super over and i was supporting mumbai through out tbis IPL ....this match deserved to be added in history and it was .....what a GAME,36
My only complaint is Shami should've gotten that MOTM award for saving our ass.,47
"I just hope after this KXIP goes on to qualify, what a amazing comeback that would be, if only SRH had won the first game as well, would have set the IPL for every team.",32
**Veer-Zaara** won three Super Overs in a single day.,43
Gayle would be worth it to any team just for the commercial value he adds to team/tournament.,33
"MI's loss has opened doors for KKR's Top 2 Hunt. I know people will bash me or downvote me, but KKR still can.",-22
"Just woke up, 3 super overs in one day? I think i‚Äôll go back to sleep",42
Thank god the match ended else Priety Zinta would have had bowled an over to Mukesh Ambani.,56
Literally every trend on Twitter is about the match. Amazing!!!!!,1
Best match of this season,2
