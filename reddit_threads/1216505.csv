Thankfully Rayadu is back and looked in good touch against MI. I think there will be 2/3 changes. Rayadu in place of Vijay definitely. I'd be interested to see if Shardul comes in place of Jadhav. Jadhav honestly has not done much with the bat anyway, so we might as well get in another bowling option. Maybe Tahir in place of Hazlewood as well (though Hazlewood has been fairly good, Tahir was the purple cap holder last year). My batting order would look like this:

1. Gaikwad/Rayadu
2. Watto
3. Faf
4. Rayadu/Gaikwad
5. Curran
6. MS
7. Jaddu
8. Piyush
9. Shardul
10. Chahar
11. Hazlewood/Tahir

Hopefully Gaikwad comes good. There are 6 bowling options now as well. Shardul can pitch in a couple of overs if Jaddu has another bad day.",6

That being said, Watson is still a HUGE threat. Hopefully Abhishek Sharma gets a chance to bowl to Watson and Faf and does something like Krunal does for MI. The pacers should be kept for Rayudu and Jadhav. Rashid Khan should be saved for MSD.

Kane Williamson significantly strengthens our middle order, and Abdul Samad showed a glimpse of his talent in the few balls he faced in the last game. I still think Vijay Shankar should be in the XI if fit, instead of Garg, simply because he provides the 6th bowler option.",6

My dad says the team is mentally disturbed and seems to have given up i.e, misconduct/misunderstanding/rift/plain arrogance by the management

Raina being the good person he is, hasn't uncovered the entire story.  Now that things are settled, he can still join the tournament half-way and make a difference.

But right at this moment,
Csk management removed their names now!! What's wrong with Harbhajan ??. 

Obviously people won't question further when you cite personal reasons. 

Seems purposeful no intent/no passion/no aggressive approach.
 I agree they are aged, but they can swing the bat right? 

Dhoni being 40 still doesn't convince me that he can't go for huge shots.

Suddenly someone knocks on my door. I quickly switch windows to highlights of Zak Crawley daddy hundred this summer before opening the door.

Lo and behold, it's Pat Cummins standing in his full glory in front of me. 

I smile. He smiles back. Maybe he heard me moaning. Oh fuck, he spotted my erect cock which got even harder looking at Cummins' gorgeous smile. 

He says, pointing towards my boner: ""Aap Dream11 pe team banao, ye kaam main kar leta hu"" ending it with a smirk.

Nobody is shitting on Dhoni's batting, it was okay, not great, he would certainly have done better with some help from the other batsmen but what about his captaincy decisions? Picked Vijay for 3 games, Jadhav for 4 games and has now thrice promoted Jadeja ahead of Curran despite Curran being 100000 times the better hitter. 

We're not supposed to hold him responsible for that? Weren't you all giving him credit for persisting with Watson last season? Same goes here - it's his team, he is the captain. He can make strong decisions but he chooses not to. He is accountable, no space for sympathy points here.",37

I personally think this shit is happening often enough that Dhoni is not helping anymore. He seems to only really go after the bowling when the game is pretty much dead.
