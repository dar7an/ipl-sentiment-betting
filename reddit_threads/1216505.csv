probably going to be a  boring game,4
"The amount of time left before this match starts is almost the same amount of time before which CSK give up the chase

Why such an early thread bot?",7
Pretty early for a match thread,1
Hoping for a nice Dhoni 40(35) masterclass,5
"What's yo opinion about makinga mixed pitch that is road on ne end and green on other. 


Like what are the cons, apart from NOTMYCRICKRT or potential low scoring matches?",2
"Dhoni will not drop Vijay.

r/cricket and twitter not gonna be happy",3
"The winner will get to the 4th/5th place on the table and the loser will be languishing in the last place. Hope we win this one. Thankfully Rayadu is back and looked in good touch against MI. I think there will be 2/3 changes. Rayadu in place of Vijay definitely. I'd be interested to see if Shardul comes in place of Jadhav. Jadhav honestly has not done much with the bat anyway, so we might as well get in another bowling option. Maybe Tahir in place of Hazlewood as well (though Hazlewood has been fairly good, Tahir was the purple cap holder last year). My batting order would look like this:

1. Gaikwad/Rayadu
2. Watto
3. Faf
4. Rayadu/Gaikwad
5. Curran
6. MS
7. Jaddu
8. Piyush
9. Shardul
10. Chahar
11. Hazlewood/Tahir

Hopefully Gaikwad comes good. There are 6 bowling options now as well. Shardul can pitch in a couple of overs if Jaddu has another bad day.",5
I am gonna protest aganist DMK office to give kanos to us next season,9
Bring back 2010 era Murali Vijay. Could do with a 128(69)*,1
"Heard Rayudu and Bravo are fit. I hope both play. My Xi would be: Gaikwad, Watson, Faf, Rayudu, MSD, Sam Curran, Bravo, Jadeja, Shardul, Chahar, Piyush.",2
"Hoping for an ice-cool 20*(25) from Dhoni in pursuit of 200.

(With 2 sixes in the last over of course)",26
Can't wait for a Thala masterclass 28(23),1
"I like how all the comments here are having digs at Dhoni with 20(25), 40(35) etc when his strike rate so far is 140.",1
"Honestly if you're playing vijay dhoni and jadhav in the XI, its difficult to chase anything above 170. Csk need to drop vijay and possibly jadhav too if he's not going to bowl anyway. Rayudu will help up the INTENT today surely but they still need someone like bravo in lower order to give them a finish",5
Hope watto shows up against his fav team,2
"I know the trend points to the contrary, but CSK is the one team that SRH should chase against. CSK haven't been put in to bat just yet, and they don't have a strong death bowler to defend runs. 

That being said, Watson is still a HUGE threat. Hopefully Abhishek Sharma gets a chance to bowl to Watson and Faf and does something like Krunal does for MI. The pacers should be kept for Rayudu and Jadhav. Rashid Khan should be saved for MSD.

Kane Williamson significantly strengthens our middle order, and Abdul Samad showed a glimpse of his talent in the few balls he faced in the last game. I still think Vijay Shankar should be in the XI if fit, instead of Garg, simply because he provides the 6th bowler option.",7
"Was watching the highlights from last year. Man, Watson was hitting 95+m sixes. They were landing in second tier of Chepauk stadium.",2
There's some weird Cricinfo bug - if the match thread is not created this early the team names change to TBC v TBC. Figured no harm in creating 1.5ish hours early.,7
"r/cricket roasting Dhoni for slow innings, only means one thing.....",5
[deleted],-5
SRH have an atrocious record against CSK. 13 to 3,7
"Off topic, shall we discuss about what's happening with the CSK management?

My dad says the team is mentally disturbed and seems to have given up i.e, misconduct/misunderstanding/rift/plain arrogance by the management

Raina being the good person he is, hasn't uncovered the entire story.  Now that things are settled, he can still join the tournament half-way and make a difference.

But right at this moment,
Csk management removed their names now!! What's wrong with Harbhajan ??. 

Obviously people won't question further when you cite personal reasons. 

Seems purposeful no intent/no passion/no aggressive approach.
 I agree they are aged, but they can swing the bat right? 

Dhoni being 40 still doesn't convince me that he can't go for huge shots.

Kinda mindfuck, but I loved this team soo much that I'm not able to watch them perform with no intent to win.",1
"It feels like Dhoni isn't even trying. I mean it's understandable if he's struggling to hit the ball like Tewatia was, but that's not even the case. He's hitting it straight to the fielders or just nudging it around the corner for a single or a two.",-5
Dhoni should stop contemplating between t20 and test mode. He should learn from kohli to play ONLY test mode and then get out #kohligoat,9
"IPL is pretty fun but this sub is unbearable during this time. So many kneejerk takes, armchair experts, mentality merchants because all the casual fans come out of the woodwork. Nothing wrong with being a casual fan but god damn do some of them say some braindead stuff",45
It's actually funny how so many think Dhoni can magically hit if he just tries even though he's 40 and he's apparently purposefully batting slowly,1
You all need to stop with the Dhoni roasting... He's gonna pull a brutal Tewatia act and you're all going to be very very sorry!,-6
Both MI and SRH have lost their first match against RCB. If CSK also loses their first RCB match. We should officially wrap up the 2020 IPL as something is seriously wrong with this year.,14
"I can't believe we r facing CSK and MI back to back, both teams have very good record aginst us. Rip our supporters, stsy strong",12
Dhoni's beard is looking good now.,7
We will probably never learn the full story of this entire Raina saga. All we will get are rumors and third hand accounts that keep everyone's biases the same.,3
Ofc today is when the team winning the toss choses correctly,11
CSK or: Curran's Screaming Kunts,3
Not a good day to bat first... SRH loss confirmed.,-7
Day 3 of understanding CSK's 200+ chasing strategy?,12
"Abhishek Sharma as the 5th bowler is something I am still doubtful about, but it's good exposure for the young man",2
TIL you can win toss and bat first.,47
"Wow Bravo back instead of a premier seamer, surprised.",3
Why Khaleel in again?,2
Kohli : what do you mean alot of changes? I do that everyweek!,3
"Yo nattu, keep the yorkers coming right from the first ball...",6
Now this CSK team looks too strong to beat,3
"SRH won the toss.....so, do they lose the game??",3
Is 3D Shankar still injured ?,3
"MS ""You know"" Dhoni",4
"Fuck..Was hoping we'd field first because CSK isn't very good at defending totals.

Anyway, I hope Williamson's innings vs DC convinced Warner and Bairstow to be less conservative at the top and play freely.",1
Why would you not play hazlewood????,7
Warner is Fucking asshole he can't chose to lose after winning toss like other captaiNS,6
"Rcb faces rr, dc and csk next week. So back to the bottom again?",4
What could be the reason in persisting with Piyush Chawla? ü§î,4
"CSK Lineup

Rayudu Watson Faf Jadhav Dhoni Bravo Jadeja Curran Chahar Shardul Chawla",3
Another one sided match. Easy win for CSK,-6
Good choice choosing bravo & shardul. Gives us 2 extra batsmen. Bravo should be a good enough bowler considering Pollard bowled decent in last to last match,4
https://twitter.com/rajasthanroyals/status/1312004480104243201,18
"Finally, the winning captain chooses to bat. Now watch them lose",38
"We are going without hazlewood or nigidi .


Wtf.",32
"So I guess CSK:

1. Rayudu
2. Watto
3. Faf
4. MS
5. Jadhav
6. S Curran
7. Jadeja
8. Bravo
9. Thakur
10. Chawla
11. D Chahar",4
Just clocked Jadhav still keeps his spot... clueless,7
"Winning the toss and choosing to bat for once

Now watch SRH lose spectacularly showing none of us know what we're talking about",8
"> Out: Vijay, Gaikwad, Hazlewood

>In: Rayudu, Thakur, Bravo",1
"Bowling will be lead by Shardul Thakur and Deepak Chahar.

Good luck CSK.",8
Jadhav keeps his spot but nigidi can't get back his spot after 1 bad over,4
Csk bowling looks weak. They should have kept Hazelwood imo.,6
"Good for CSK to include extra bowler Shardul, still not convinced that Hazlewood should have been replaced by Bravo as he was bowling really well.",5
"Raina - Dhoni rift confirmed

https://twitter.com/ImRaina/status/1312024045987258369",9
So CSK lost the toss. So is there still hope for them?,2
CSK batting is really deep this time I think Dhoni will come in at 4 tonight.,8
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjU_YG_UYAAV-UY.jpg,1
Kanos üòç,2
"This thread is unusually dead for CSK .


Don't say it's like csk chase",5
"CSK dropped 2 batsmen and a bowler and they picked a batsmen, an all-rounder and a bowler and has got a stronger batting now thanks to Thakur",7
Maybe I am underestimating Abdul Samad bowling but SRH looks like a bowler short.,6
"I know

Csk can't bench bravo.",2
SRH will lose quite easily unfortunately.,-1
Time-travelling 4D Shankar decided not to play today after seeing his nemesis Rayudu in the CSK XI.,18
Does Dhoni think that two mediocre bowlers will do the same job as one good bowler?,6
Suddenly CSK line up looking great!,6
CSK gonna make the playoffs again. GG.,3
[removed],9
Easy 2 points for SRH incoming.,4
"Even Kohli dropped Umesh but Dhoni still has to keep Jadhav.

Don't CSK have any replacement for him?",10
Chahar being a creep,4
I'm looking forward to our batsmen gently patting the ball for singles against Abhishek Sharma in a breathtaking display of Sensible Batting‚Ñ¢.,55
On paper atleast CSK is BatDeep^TM . Everyone can bat,11
Holy shit talk about batdeep. wth CSK,1
inb4 Watson scores a century and completely mocks SRH bowling since he likes to shit on SRH :(,9
"tbh vijay has been dropped and for me that's it, idc if they win or not, Vijay is dropped!",22
"CSK big win today, you heard it here first",-1
My prediction is SRH gonna win easily.,1
"Why do we go from 5 bowlers to 7 bowlers all of a sudden? I would have stuck with Gaikwad instead of Shardul. Anyway, this lineup looks a lot more reliable than first 3 matches.",1
Bravo was decent with the ball in the recently concluded CPL. I hope he does well here because CSK really needs him to fire.,1
What's the use of Batdeep when MSD and Jadhav are just going to be tuk tuk?,1
I wanna see CSK go with this lineup against DC and MI in Sharjah. They are gonna get hit for 250 üòÇüòÇüòÇ,9
"Decent batting barring Jadhav, fucker getting in the team for no reason",7
Gotta feel for Gaikwad. Got dropped after being played completely out of position in a high scoring chase and getting run out in the other innings. Still not as bad as Miller getting dropped without facing any deliveries though.,5
Shardul gonna get his half century tonight,6
Everyone's gangsta until nattu throws in 6 yorkers in the 19th over...,26
Senjuuuuduve üòé *maari theme*,-1
"I just realized csk mostly had two foriegn all-rounders.

Albi- bravo",-1
[deleted],-1
lmao so dhoni can actually bat at 9 if he wants to in this lineup,10
"Hazlewood is unlucky tbh, Curran couldn't have been dropped. Maybe they could have taken a chance by dropping Watson and opening with Faf and Rayudu",3
Shardul Thakur increasing the batting depth of both the sides.,124
"Thrown in Santner instead of Bravo imo, Santner is a much better bowler.",7
I thought Hazelwood was pretty good last game. Why was he benched?,1
"IPL has been god sent for me. With everything on social media and the news so overly politicised, I have finally found my escape from the shitty reality.",12
"Its easy for CSK to win, just get the top 3 out. Just like how Mumbai did yesterday",0
Vijay cannot score 100 (32) today because he got dropped #JusticeForVijay,7
I love how even comments ironically saying csk will win is get downvoted,10
"11 batsman, how can we utilise that hmmmm",0
Damn Rayudu is back just when we thought we can sneak a win on handicapped CSK as our record against them is pretty bad :(,1
I am here to hype nattu and that is all I will do for the rest of the season....üòéüòéüòé,4
"***CSK games exists***

Interesting field set-up.,2
I miss Tom moody in th SRH dugout! He's one of the few guys who's opinion in ESPNcricinfo isn't biased unlike most Indian guys sitting there!,8
"SRH are fielding only 5 bowlers and one of them is Abhishek Sharma. They may be putting too much pressure on the lad. 
If CSK batsmen target him, might affect him confidence.",4

this squad is much much better than last games,5
"Now that Bairstow exposed his stumps to a swinging ball, Watson should return the compliments by exposing his pads",2
I wonder if there is any merit in playing an Aussie and a Pom against each other even in IPL. For instance I have seen Watto go bonkers specifically against English bowlers a few times.,1
Vijay played cautiously (no risks) in matches to retain his position in the side for the whole season. Look who is out of the team bitch,4
Hopefully they let lord Thakur finish his overs before the death,1

Why is Basil Thampi whose [recent figures](https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/732291.html) have been impressive not in the playing XI?,1

Really hope Pandey quits SRH for any other team. The fans have always disrespected my boi!,-1
CSK's 11 all can bat.,8
The amount of facial hair on Dhoni is directly proportional to how serious the match is?,11
Are KP and Gavaskar sleeping together?,12
I do not what the commentators are talking about. VVS would have flicked that to deep mid-wicket.,3

"Short of a length, bouncy, leg cutter to Warner. That's my call.

im actually sad we dont get to see Rayudu vs 3d,6
Look at that bugger,1
Idk if it's just me but Pandey has looked better than Bairstow this season .Maybe switch their positions ?,2
As a neutral I just hope both team remember this is a T20 game.,5
Bhuvu salivating rn,11
last day the cred app winner was the same software engineer¬Ø\_‡≤†_‡≤†_/¬Ø,5
How come it's the 13th IPL season and no IPL team have figured out that body line Short balls are the hot stuff against Warner.,2
Two consecutive days my captain got out for a duck in the first over -_-,10
Is it the same cred player who keeps appearing. Seems like I have seen him before on that screen.,6
Idk why Pandey is in at 3 when they have Kane. He has done well at 5/6 as the finisher for India in Australia and NZ. SRH are desperate for experience in lower middle order. Playing there and finishing matches in the only way in for Pandey in the team for WT20. Who is making the decisions over there at SRH management.,5
"Warner doing a pandey there

Dots then a single to keep strike",8
"I remember the new Indian internationals being much better this IPL than last season despite having ordinary perfomances! 

Dube got better at finishing and bowling, Sundar was unplayable in that one match, Agarwal has done enough to keep the Universe boss out the entire season! Wonder how Shardul would do!",6

Curran to fuck Warner up,3
CSK stacked their batting all the way to 8. They know they just have to take it deep into the innings and explode. Get through Rashid Khan and target the last 6 overs.,3

Bairstow getting bowled to an inswinger. Things are getting back to normal guys.,-2
‚ÄòManish Pandya‚Äô,4
Pandey looks gooooood,1
Woah! Pandey playing like a champ.,1
Pandey is so good to watch when he's aggressive. I sometimes feel he plays too much within himself - both in the IPL and for India. He's a beast for Karnataka where he plays freely without fear.,10
Imagine you‚Äôre chilling on your phone in your own home and Rishabh fucking Pant comes out of nowhere and tells you make a team on Dream11,9
Shardul bowling at the end. It's gonna be a High scoring game I guess Bois.,1
"This is going just like the last meeting in Chennai. Bairstow out for duck, Warner starting slowly, Pandey playing aggressively.",1
"I‚Äôve watched a lot of CPL and now quite a bit of IPL over the past few months and I can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, I really hate sponsored 6‚Äôs and powerplays etc. Just say 6. Or allow Mark Nicholas to shout SIXER.",38
Manish pandey looks like he'd be the generic indian face in a diversity program poster,97
Soon Chad Pandey will look behind at Dhoni after hitting a 6 and say ‚ÄúBsdk idhar dekhke le!‚Äù Then pee on the stumps to establish dominance.,5

Dhoni: 194

Raina: 193

Is it me or does it feel like CSK always stretches their batting deep against us more than they do for other teams?,2
Warner should continue giving strike to Pandey. One of these guys need to play until the end.,2
What's everyone's thoughts: CSK or SRH?,2
I miss the old Warner,10
Why do they glorify having chocolate spread all over your face like a two year old.. I don't get it,4
What a sensible batting from Pandeyji,2

Good call to not run the 2nd there.,4

Pandey was 83*(49)",21
"> M Pandey 25 (15)

Who is this guy and what has he done with the real Manish Pandey?",45
Warner 6(11). Dhoni's hands already itching. Nice strategy Warner.,15
Warner should just play second fiddle to pandey now.... He can go berserk in later overs,9

Warner wasting powerplay,1
"I really hope Bayliss and Warner have a plan in mind to execute Abhishek Sharma‚Äôs 4 overs. Last game, Abhishek was able to ball well because Rashid was picking wickets. With CSK‚Äôs deep lineup and their patience, it feels like Abhishek is being sent out to be murdered.",3
Do people here remember that Thakur used to travel by local trains in Mumbai? And that was his USP,2
"Don't dive like that DJ, CSK will lose you again!",2
Virat makes 3(14) and still comes in all the ads trying to make me buy the products he endorses.,11

"Hey IPL I have an idea. You need to monetize that purple and orange cap.

For example 


Hero Splendor Purple cap: solid mileage --> most wickets . Goes well. 

Hdfc Orange Cap: Good bank, reliable - --> best batsman also sort of goes well. 
 
You know , attributes that can be used to sell your product.

You can charge a few million bucks for the commentators to mention those 2 twice or thrice every innings, a few times during the pre, mid innings and the post game show and once during the presentation.",3
Bravo's inclusion adds  much more stability to this CSK side  I think,3

"CSK have always gone with overseas experience, haven't they? Haydos, Hussey, Dougie Bollinger, Baz...kinda amazing how well the 'tired legs' have performed when it matters",6
Warner starts slower in T20s than he does on test cricket,2
"Even though SRH lost a very early wicket, they didn‚Äôt let CSK become dominant on them. CSK in the same situation would go into hibernation with 20-1 at the 5 over mark",12
Curran top effort boii,2
Looks like SRH have target of 40 set for themselves for the power play. How many times have I seen this.,6
Shardul in 2019 IPL had economy of 9.36. Why is he in the team again?,4
Damn that CSK side looks hella intimidating. Need at least a 170-180 and we might have a chance,4
"Mark my words

Warner not focusing on boundaries, probably gonna feast on 2s after the powerplay",7
Smug face of Salman bhai really asking for punches.,5
42/1 after 3 overs of Chahar on a lively wicket is a fantastic start.,4
I feel like Bairstow is saving his century for us.,1
I can only imagine the flak Pandey would have received had the scores between the two batsmen been switched.,5
Dugout producers must have hired an outsider coz they were smart enough till now to not to bring commentators like nehra.,-3

This season has been Pandey's SRH career in a nutshell -  Slow and not fluent when he accumulates runs and always gets out prematurely when he's fluent and aggressive.,5
I love you Kane. Please get out.,1
Nehra makes it sound like bowlers don't want to bowl Yorkers and only do it out of necessity. Bowlers don't bowl Yorkers because they're exhaustive to bowl. There's one theory that you need stamina worth 3 length balls to bowl a single Yorker. Bowlers would bowl 24 Yorkers if they can..,-1
Lmaoo what if Piyush fucks the entire r/cricket w his rajma chawal ass today?,2
4D Chess by Manish Pandey to gift his wicket to Shardul Thakur and ensure CSK keep him in the lineup,10
Pandey was settled and should've kicked on. What a shame,6
Shardul's strategy of throwing absolute filth so that the batsman can't help swinging at it is genius,14

Give Watto a bowl,1
mfw our last recognized batsman walks in at number 4,3
KANOS > YJB. Can't believe they dropped him in the first two games.,6
Really want Kane to score a 75(45) today. SRH needs it considering how out of touch Warner is looking.,7
Damn Warner not getting the strike,1
What's this raging desire to keep bowling full in the slot madarchod,7
How is Rashid not SRH's most important player????,7
Omfg,1
Pandey please leave srh franchise. You deserve better fans than these.,9
"What were SRH doing in the auction? SRH really have only 3 batsmen - Bairstow, Warner and Williamson (same since past 2-3 years). Can't rely on Pandeyji and the middle order is filled with rookies like Samad, Garg etc. Horrendous planning",2
Nehraji won't shut up it seems,2

How is Thakur producing so many mistakes...,2

It feels like there is a different vibe with csk in this match. Don't you all think?,9
Ashish Nehra we get it you can shut the fuck up now,8
Watson very average in the field today,3
Srh always looks kinda off color against csk. Even when they have a good team.,5
"Both teams want meme crown. 

Jadhav still being picked, could groom some youngster instead",2
Umpires should allow CSK to bring in a substitute fielder in place of Watson.,10
Watto dived on purpose so that he doesn't have to chase the ball,12
3rd time today that Watson had to dive but wasnt quick enough,5
This csk side looks good they have peole who can bat till no 11 and have more than 6 bowling options,2
SRH are going through the same pace as MI yesterday,4

CSK could shoot the umpire over a disagreement and they'd still be on top of the fairplay awards. Literally never seen them below number 1.,15
Damn first time I'm seeing Bravo with hair,1
Last  3 overs only 8 runs,6
Lol. Nehra is good. He is not sucking up to Dhoni. Says things as it is.,11
"Idk why people keep saying home ground advantage for Csk, the last time we won we played full season at Pune.",7
Those are some good looping slow Yorkers.,1
Why does Dhoni look so beaten up?,-5
srh is following mi's strategy. except they dont have a pollard or pandya. and csk death bowling isn't neesham and gowtham type bowlers.,6

Just bringing in bravo has solved maybe half of the problems of csk.,9
As they blasting KP over a loudspeaker? Wouldn't that be distracting the players?,2
"How does this CSK squad look so much stronger than last two games, Bravo gives some security at death plus strengthens the batting too, at least on paper.",8
"Guys...this is what Saha died for

But his spirit lives on",25
Dwayne Chadwick boseman Bravo,1
Is Balaji not the bowling coach for CSK anymore?,3
"SRH be like we will give you a small target, so CSK won't bore everyone out later",7
[deleted],0
Sheikh Mohammed came down today to do umpiring.,3
CSK's fielding and field placements have been on point. Warner hasn't run as much as he did the last game.,4
What on earth was Bravo appealing for there?,7
Is 160 possible from here?,6
Can‚Äôt believe we lost to SRH. Even CSK is beating them comprehensively.,2
"CSK's batting is so shitty they have to keep Tahir and Hazlewood on the bench, sad.",2
Watson at point!üò≠,2
Oh boy. We can't even hit Shardul Thakur or Bravo,3
There seems to be a pattern emerging of teams winning the game after losing the toss,0
Why does Dhoni look so angry?,2
"Drinking game:-

Take a shot every time Bravo bowls a slower ball",1
"So I got a question, Why doesn't Ian Smith commentate in the IPL? 

I would love to hear ""Staggering!"" whenever some young kid hits a big six in the death overs",0
Everything I expected and nothing I didn't.,6
"Did y'all not see the last match or what? MI scored so many runs in the death. Of course, SRH doesn't have someone like Pollard or Hardik but still, anything can happen.",2
"folks watching the tamil commentary, is hemang badani wearing a wig? his hairline looks super suspect lol.",1
Damn good first two over from Bravo .let's hope he keeps its up in the back end.,6
"As expected, snooze fest in progress",1
"Just hope these 2 stay till 15 overs. Even if SRH are at 95 then, they‚Äôll end up at 170+",-5
Was that a slow or slower one,1
Ay! The Orange cap holders of last 4 years are batting under 100 SR. Nice! Nice!,12
I'm getting Warner vs India in 2019WC vibes here,5
140- is Dhoni territory score and CSK are invincible then.,8
This may as well be the season where CSK finishes outside the top 4 for the first time. I could be wrong though.,-1
Ah test match.,0
Anyone noticing any issue with hotstar today?,1
Just want Kane to play a switch hit just for the memes.,1
Crowd chant sounds like The Dark knight rises' chant.,4
Kanos auditioning for a CSK role. My man's not getting playing time at SRH,5
Consider Anything  150+ a big score in SRH world,3
This is painful banter,2
Intent finally,2
David Warner : I can be a right hander if I want.,4
"So i drove the altroz recently (was looking around for a premium hatchback) 

pros:-

loaded with features, good seats up in the front and massive doors which can be pulled back to allow older people to get in.Also loved the ride quality, bumps are absorbed well. Its a great city car

cons:-

Most of my problems are with the engine. Way too loud and i didn't like the performance and i feel it redlines way too early for better fuel economy",3
Finally Warner Anna reached 100 strike rate üòç,2
Faf take a bow!!!,1
Faf Da Pussyü§©ü§©ü§©,1
FAF DEJA FUCKING VUUUUU,1
Fuck that. Fuck that. Fuck that.,2
How many times I've to praise the Altroz to get the car?,1
du Plessis boundary cathing god,1
Faf you beauty!,1
Fuck. Suicide alert,3
Snoozefest,2
Regular business for faf,3
Faf be like just another day in the office,2
CSK look more balanced but they still need to make room for Tahir. It is inexplicable that spin looks the weakest link in their bowling. Maybe drop Watson and Open with Curran for brisk starts?,3
"Mother of Christ, Faf!",3
Damn these catches are becoming normal.,2
SRH you fucked up bois.,3
du Plessis boundary cathing god,3
I hate you faf,3
Just some extra pyrotechnics by faf. He had that easy,3
"""You shall not pass""",4
DuPlesis has got to trademark that catch. He probably would take that in his sleep by now.,3
Lol we are fucked haha,5
MF Faf again.,2
Faf is a monster.,1
What horrible commentary on such a fine catch,2
Swann low-key bookie,2
Aaaand the tail begins.,7
Faf da man,4
Ouch! LOL,5
Faf!,5
Why why why,5
FUCKING DU PLESSIS,2
Orange Army: (*Chuckles*) **I'm in Danger**,9
Faf u beautiful man,5
Faf is just teasing us with the Rope dance,6
I like faf,4
Faf is such a good fielder on the boundary.,6
Faf doing Faf again,4
What a champion catcher!,3
faf ü§ùr/fieldingporn,3
Srh cucked,2
"**10.5** Chawla to Warner, OUT, **are we even surprised anymore with this guy?** **69-3**

DA Warner c du Plessis b Chawla 28 (29b 3x4 0x6) SR: 96.55",3
I love how ten years ago we'd be losing our minds over that catch and now it's just expected,7
Faf at it again,3
Easy catch made it look difficult lol,-1
Warner seems very restrictive this IPL,6
"Far didn‚Äôt even have to that boundary ride catch thing, just showing off.",1
We're fucked bois,5
"They really need to make a Fielder of the tournament award. 

Good, reliable fielding is criminally underrated in terms of awards and recognition.",8
Bad bad innings that.,6
Faf just doing it for the lolz now,2
FaF dancing infront of SRH dugout noice.,9
Faf is amazing on the boundary,3
Warner is no more warner,2
"See how easily he is doing this, Fafulous",2
"Someone from our dugout should've tripped Faf there. Come on, guys! Play Bold!",2
"Wtf, it's third time back to back whenever I open ESPNcricinfo wicket falls INSTANTLY.",1
Faf y u do dis,2
Warner Faf'd up!,1
Now faf is just showing off.,1
Right infront SRH dug-out.,2
Just threw his wicket away to Choola SRH is just pulling an RCB here,1
Lmao srh watching faf awkwardly,3
Damn now Warner's gone,1
Warner can't even pad runs in the IPL anymore. Man's truly in the red-zone.,1
Its a crime to catch like that,1
"Shut up Sunny G, We all know how awesome Faf but cut Piyush some slack!",0
We still have Kane guys. It's going to be okay. Right?,1
"10 overs between williamson, samad and garg. welllp.",1
At least make it look like the other team has a chance dude,1
"Thank you warner, well played.",2
This has become common style catch for duplesis.,3
Into the tail into the tail,0
"Get Williamson too and SRH might not even get to 120

Edit: I'm so sorry",0
Burden of this batting lineup is weighing too much on Warner. Every year dependency of this team on him is only growing. He can only do so much.,2
Would have loved to see the full footage of Warner‚Äôs face as FDP caught that,6
"He just went out the boundary for the fun of it, this man",8
There was no need for that from Faf. He wasn't running or in motion. He could've stood still and still taken a clean catch,0
Jadeja to bowl the next over.,2
Faf has to be a contender for purple cap.,3
"There was no need for Faf to do that, he easily caught it standing straight",1
Faf is just shorter Pollard.,2
Duplessis doing it in front of srh squad lol,2
Did SRH release Moises Henriques?,1
Dhoni god behind stumps,2
Gone damn,2
LETS GO BOIS,1
WTF,1
Planet Faf has his own atmosphere that pulls the ball from over 6 feet over his head!!,2
Swann should try to get a job at the Shakespearian theatre lmao.,1
Du plessis doesn't even drop some,1
Priyam Garg 100 IQ,3
"Faf is our cheatcode. Should consider playing shirtless more often, ez trophies.",4
"Now, that's the team I know!",2
YES YES YES GO GO GO,1
"For a supposed aging squad, CSK are pretty good fielders",3
jesus fuckin christ!,1
Wow beauty..rayudu and msd!!!,3
WOAH CSK WITH THE WICKETS,1
SRH aren‚Äôt even going to make 100,3
"Dammit, I hoped they would make it to atleast 100 before the tail opened up",3
Swanny such a dork üòÇüòÇ,2
Complete implosion,2
Wtf was that ?,2
wtf how do they get these wicket alerts right?,2
Oh my god! RIP SRH,2
Faf you are amazing,4
SRH are fucked,2
Disaster,1
"No Kanos, no.. wtf was that",2
it finished now!,1
Kane train derailed lmao,4
Garg: Ight imma NOT head out,6
Garg lol. U-19 captain my ass.,4
Faf taking the catch right in front of the srh dugout. Could see their faces drop in synchronization.,8
"Bravo made his test/ODI debut in 2004. He's been around since the 1st IPL. He played his last ODI in 2014, but he has been playing in T20s ever since, he won't be around for too many more years. He'll be 37 next year, I'm not sure he'll be playing.",5
Dhoni god level  keeping,5
Bye bye Kanos,6
Bruh wtf is this,5
What happened over there?,3
F in the chat,3
What was that run-out ?,4
Never a single there tbf,9
COLLAPSE,4
Wtf was garg doing?,7
S R H  T A I L  B E G I N S,3
Dude what the fuck,4
Look SRH is an average team and the fans getting pumped over DC being stupid and attacking Rashid is all good but eventually not going to work.,-1
GET FUCKED SRH,3
AMBATI!,1
You can now deboard the Kane train,4
"Ok wtf Garg, you should've sacrificed your wicket there",10
Man absolute scenes if Dhoni had missed that Parry!,4
Damn Kane's face,6
"Haha. I selected CSK in my Zomato cashback today and SRH are helping me immensely to win it.. 
Can't believe we lost to this SRH side.",9
"Priyam Garg,you buffoon.",6
Fuck you Garg,8
HOLY SHIT,4
Graeme Swann is a fucking gem.,3
Hahahahaha.... poor Kane,2
Warner transformation from pocket Gayle to Left handed Rahane in all these years been SAD to see,3
Garg should have sacrificed,4
Another snooze fest coming üò¥,7
Suddenly SRH find themselves in tail,11
120 here is a stretch.,2
No run there,3
"**10.6** Chawla to Williamson, OUT, **they've got Kane next ball!** **69-4**

KS Williamson run out (Rayudu/&dagger;Dhoni) 9 (13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 69.23",2
Packup,4
Rip SRH,5
He wasn't even angry but haven't seen kane that angry,5
First time I've seen Kane lose his cool and the man played in the World Cup final.,12
Wtf i just went to take a shit and both the white guys are out,1
Priyam Garg was the imposter,11
Where was Garg even gazing at. Ffs,8
brainless running by Williamson,6
RIP SRH,7
"This is surreal. The ball watching by Garg. Fuckin idiot.

E - on seeing the replay, there was no run. So bad calling by Kane. But still the ball watching Garg.",10
"That entire footage was appropriate for YouTube.

Watch entire SRH dugout die inside as du Plessis takes away their only hope for a half decent total.",17
Du plessis is a God. Makes sure CSK isn't the worst at Fielding,4
Kill me. Kill me now.,7
Wow priyam fucked that,3
Priyam garg you better show up today,3
teeno ko fantasy mein liya tha teeno hag diye bc,6
That was Williamson's fault,13
"Shocking by Garg!!!

Never seen Kanos angry like this. More exasperation than anger tbf",13
"Some rare anger from KW there, one day that suppressed World Cup anger gonna explode out of him.",48
That's all folks!,1
How did we manage to bring Chawla back in form? Is Dhoni next?,11
"I am a csk fan but i feel for kane man. He hardly gets games in ipl to being with:(
Love watching him on the field.",6
First time I am seeing Williamson even showing anger.,8
"Bruh, you know you've messed up when you get Kanos angry. Garg is gonna get dropped next match lmao",7
Top 10 IPL comedy moments üòÅ,3
Huuuuuuge wicket,3
Great now Williamson's gone,2
That wasn't a run in the first place?,6
"You can say Garg maybe should've sacrificed his wicket but really, there's never a single there

Williamson just hit it and ran",11
"GG, any bets we reach 100+?",3
Priyam garg gtfo,6
"We are back baby hahaha

In before we tuk tuk and lose the game again",5
gg CSK,1
"Garg should just self imolate right now.

It was wrong call. But when kanos calls you go.",7
WTF,1
Faf goes in and out of boundary line so much his wife would be jealous,3
"There was absolutely no single there, what is Kane angry about lol",13
he's lost in his thoughts!,1
U-19 shit stain Garg. His net contribution to the team is negative 100 runs.,4
"Yes the old way of trying to take an impossible single and then blaming it on the new comer non striker
5d chess moment of the day by Kanos",9
I dont think this was Garg's fault,4
" each srh wicket = 2, so this helps",2
Garg is an absolute nonce,3
CSK can relax and bowl pies and SRH would still not score above 130 now.,0
So SRH first beat us which i hate already and then lose to CSK which i hate even more.,0
I feel SRH are gonna implode and finish sub 100 here. Hope not tho.,2
"Alright boys, Friday evening. Watch a movie or series. This match is done and dusted.",2
SRH's batting order's gonna collapse considering them not having enough depth,1
I actually do not mind our top order getting out for a low score. Now it's up to the young guns.  Excited!,3
I told you CSK will be back and they proved it.,7
Lmao if your best player asks for a run just go for it,8
"there was no run but hey kid he has like 10+ yr exp.

Stop being a f*ng selfish retard and run",6
You know you've effed up when you make Kane angry.,4
As an Srh fan I can confirm we have lost,3
Sadly I get the feeling people will blindly abuse Garg for a run out that wasn't even his fault,10
"Disaster!!

Think about the young man who just got Williamson runout!!",6
And kids that is how Judas betrayed Jesus,5
Shikhar Dhawan can easily play well the role of a funny Bollywood gunda,5
Kane Williamson doesn't care. He will run. Run Williamson Run.,3
Never seen kane so animated after getting out,13
And.. that's the game folks.,3
lol that stepping out and then coming back in was frankly an overkill. he was under control after taking the catch,0
That's the match. Done and dusted. That is how Laxman wants SRH to be.,2
Garg you ignorant slut,7
naah not wasting my time rooting for srh. this is just incorrigible.,6
"No cricketing sense from Garg, staring at the fielder rather than communicating with his partner",13
Ambaati Rayu Du Du Du Du Du....,8
Garg has no game iq.,4
Competely on Garg. Either call no or take off. Fuck you if you're ball watching.,11
Faf on the rope is pure sex,5
Brainfade,4
"Oh god pls I want to watch YUSUF PATHAN walking out at this time, why is he not playing IPL :(",3
It's refreshing to see umpire directly giving out without passing it to the third umpire.,3
[deleted],-5
"Apparently theres a stat, Faf has never dropped a catch for CSK. Absolutely brilliant fielder",21
So lemme be clear.. we are blaming a 20 year old for not running like an idiot/sacrificing his wicket when a 30 year old veteran ran for a non-existent single. Woah wtf,42
"I don't get it, even if there was no run there, why would you, an unproven youngster, decide you're more valuable than Kanos and throw him under the bus?",4
[removed],-19
The seccond innings curse is just the winning toss curse in disguise,6
"Sorry Kanos, but that was never a single",19
Imagine blaming the 19 year old for not taking a suicidal single instead of the senior batsman for hitting and running without looking,38
"There was definitely no single there, but maybe Garg should have sacrificed himself there",-2
Don't blame garg there. He did the right thing.,28
Kanos thought he was playing with Warner.,6
"Yes it was the striker's call but the non striker didn't do anything ,he just watched the ball .",2
SRH consistently giving the most boring games in the tournament,10
I don't think you can blame Garg just because Kane's a senior player. There was no single there.,7
I still think Abhishek will do something good,1
Problem with these guys is not six hitting but they take up too many dots instead of going for singles and then go big and get out.,8
"Rayudu tipping his cap to Vijay Shankar in the SRH Dugout : 3D, my ass!",11
That may have been the fastest over in IPL 2020.,8
Lol sub 2 min over,5
Easiest over Jaddu got to bowl this season.,7
This is gonna be another 118-10 isn‚Äôt it?,5
Sucks to see Hyderabad 69ing themselves like this,7
"**Most wickets in T20 cricket by Indian player**

**Piyush Chawla 256**

Amit Mishra 255

Ravi Ashwin 237

Harbhajan Singh 235

Vinay Kumar 194

Yuzi Chahal 194",7
Blink and you miss jaddu's over.,13
Jadeja 10 second over lol,7
Absolutely unbelievable how utterly weak they are after the top 3.,2
Time  to get overs of Chawla/Jaddu/Thakur out of the way.,4
damn 4 wickets down under 6 runrate. sadge for srh,2
Who are these two lads? Never heard of them,-2
"Why are people blaming Garg? There wasn't any run there and Garg shouted waiting, Kane was hell bent on getting someone run out.",9
Bye guys if I watch this any longer it'll put me in depression,5
there was no single there. garg is not to blame.,10
"There was no run there. Kane's fault, not Garg's.

People getting angry at Garg are being biased.",12
I blame myself for saying 'at least it's not Kane' when Warner got out,6
Good chance for CSK spinners to stat pad here,9
Now teams will win toss and choose to lose again thanks to SRH lol.,3
Chawla tf was that ball,3
Garg better score a 100 if he ever want to visit Char Minar ever again,3
"According to commentators it was Williamson's fault.

There was no run. I agree.",10
Chawla still bowls like he‚Äôs a fucking rookie,3
Just because you like the player doesn't mean you lose perspective. That run out is as much on Kane as it is on Garg. There never was a run there.,6
"Ik what the flair says, but I hope Priyam can put that behind him and turn it around",3
Just declare csk a win and we can save some time.,4
Idiot kanos,-1
It isn't RCB. It's tough being a supporter of SRH with weak batting order.,5
"Ahh yes, an uncapped Indian player's wicket is worth more than the New Zealand captain's who is also one of the best players in the world right now.",0
Whose mistake was that?  It seemed like a risky single.  I think Kane should not have gone for it unless Priyam called for it.,3
Is Dhoni not doing the 'extending the leg to prevent balls going for a boundary' thing any longer?,6
"If these youngsters perform, damnit I'd be happy for India's future",5
Last 2 overs scoring is in binary. Smh.,3
everyone can hate on garg or kane for that but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that rayudu is fuckin lightning on the field,7
"Once everyone's done with knee-jerk reactions, do you still put that dismissal on Garg?",5
Long back in IPL an Under-19 youngster Tanmay Agarwal ran out Yuvraj Singh and he went to dark nameless world forever. Feels same for Garg here üòû,4
[removed],1
"Oof, four dots followed by a single off the last ball is some gully cricket PTSD",6
I hope Garg can do a Tewatia and redeem himself,0
How things turned suddenly,5
"Yuck. Priyam Garg, you are a moron",-4
"Lmao, Kanos said 'Cmon Bro'.",3
bro that was kinda kanes call even if it was stupid,3
"Didn't expect the reaction from kane, knowing mistake was clearly on his side.",3
"Brainless cricketer from both batsmen in that run out. There was never a run there, but non striker quietly ball watching instead of communicating with his partner, plus it Kanos' call",10
lmao garg was like ‚Äúanyway-‚Äú,3
"Jesus another almost run out

Garg does not want to be there rn",2
Kane called wrong but Gargs wicket is worth much less so he should have sacrificed,2
If Garg scores low he's out of the eleven next match,6
Hope Garg gets a fast fifty here otherwise the guy is gonna get shredded on social media.,5
People in the sub blaming Garg for mot sacrificing his wicket for Kane's stupidity are the types to go on twitter and abuse players after every bad performance.,11
Garg gonna shit on the entire r/cricket,9
"As an SRH fan, all I want to know is, what's good on Netflix these days?",10
so garg was just supposed to give his wicket away cuz kane made a braindead decision? i don't think it's fair to blame garg here tbh.,14
[deleted],-8
Wouldnt be Kane if he didnt run himself out at least once,38
i hope that wicket doesn't affect Gargs morale.,8
Abhishek doing proper defence,5
[deleted],3
"Kane: * Calls for a run *

Garg: *What a nice looking ball*",10
Tuk tuk is back on the menu bois and this time without dhoni.,0
Haven't seen Garg bat well under pressure in Under-19 tournament the little chance he got. Today he can write history by making 52(38),3
Piyush Chawlaritharan,2
Good to see Indian youngsters focusing on the OG Test format instead of chasing towards T20 glory.,4
May be SRH should practice running between the wickets coz thats pathetic,1
"Our game's over lol, at 10th over of first innings, that's how terrible we are.",1
Literally two players from u19 playing the most experienced team.,6
"Garg should be batting at 3 if he's in the team 
 
Manish is your insurance against collapse like this",3
Abhishek mann wtf exactly is your plan?,1
Look how many balls they're eating up,1
"I agree there wasn‚Äôt a run there but wtf was Garg thinking like if there‚Äôs no run there at least call no, don‚Äôt just stand there and watch your teammate get out",1
Imagine playing against a team that is willing to give up the chase but you don‚Äôt score enough.,7
"You sacrifice your wicket to keep the better batsman on strike at the end of an innings or a chase

Not for a needless single halfway through because he's decided to hit and run",12
SRH will be bottom of the table after today‚Äôs game unless CSK batting shits the bed too,7
Typical r/cricket blaming a youngster for the fault of a senior player,15
Don't worry...... If we go past 120 we still have chance,3
"I love watching Kane bat, but you can't blame a youngster for his fault. Careers are destroyed with one innings and Garg deserves to get out on his own rather than sacrificing his wicket for a run which wasn't there.",2
"Wow, we're straight up defending now. Just dots

Also, Garg just lazily going back to his crease with the bat in the air - was a disgrace",9
Abhishek Sharma has a 20 ball 50 in IPL,2
Only Samad can save srh now,7
"Abhishek, Gard and Samad. I've a good feeling about it..",4
Which middle order are these two defending for? Just start going for shots lol,3
have we ever seen kane this frustrated? i feel like he's gonna leave srh soon :(,4
"Jadeja being given some easy overs to regain his confidence.

Edit: and is getting hit even in those heh",1
Garg almost looks like pandey while batting,2
Yeah we sulk but this is a good opportunity for our players to gain experience. Let us believe in them.,2
Lmfao Jaddu getting belted by kids.,9
First Six,1
Abishek do it bro. All hopes on you,4
"Can't be too harsh on Garg, Brain-fart there, but this can happen under pressure for a youngster. The problem lies with SRH management to put 3 youngsters in the most pressure positions of 5-6-7.",6
Time for youngsters to prove their worth,2
CSK fans right now : we're all gonna die!,7
Jadeja being treated like the shit spinner he is,4
Sanjay just called him Abhishek Nayar lol,5
this is a really great opportunity for these two youngsters.,1
Clean af.,3
Jadeja continuing to get smoked,2
"There's really something about this kid.

I don't expect garg to do what Abhishek's doing",1
Woah! Abhishek showing how it is done.,3
Okay I take my words back,3
How far are SRH from RCB and KXIP in terms of being the meme team,5
ahh the csk spinners.......,1
[deleted],-8
This is kinda what we needed. We need our inexperienced to gain some playtime.,3
Finally this young players can play freely as they like without the pressure of senior at other end,6
Jaddu bhai kemcho? üôÑ,2
Jaddu bowling sweet pies,5
Bangar thinks Abhishek Nayar is batting. Fuck me.,14
Let's see how our middle order goes.,6
My expectations for Srh were low but holy fuck,10
"People, two u-19 boys are out there.

Let's just support them, instead of badmouthing Priyam Garg for not throwing his wicket away for something that was not his mistake.

I am rooting for them. GO ABHISHEK. GO PRIYAM.",22
I s2g this sub treats Williamson like some weird demigod child who can do no wrong,9
"Abhishek ""Yuvraj Singh"" Sharma (according to no one but Yuvraj Singh who loves him way too much)",9
"Abhishek Sharma- "" I am the new Jaddu now""





Jadeja: üò≥",8
"Sanjay, it is Abhishek Sharma and not Abhishek Nair. How  many times will you call it wrong?",3
Jaddu gonna have PTSD,0
"Yes Abhishek!!!, show them that your last name is not Bachchan",5
"No more spinner, please....",3
Jadeja hasn't looked good with the ball this season,3
If Abhishek Sharma developes his big-hitting he can easily replace Jadeja in T20I teams,-1
"Garg, you were the under 19 captain for a reason. Please show us what you're capable of",3
"Just because its Kanos, and is much loved by the whole world for his smile even after losing in the WC finals, r/cricket blames it on the kid, had it been kohli or Sharma, the single would've gotten non existent!",8
These guys are super stars if they manage to get us over 150,1
It's something about the way they say Unacademy that I keep hearing Khan Academy.,1
"'Unacademy Cracking 6' is even worse than the 'Hero Maximum' from the CPL

At least Hero Maximum sounds cool, this one is clunky and awkward",6
Abhishek Sharma is the T20 all-rounder people think Jadeja is.,2
If I download this My11 Circle app and and score higher than Ganguly do I get to be BCCI president?,9
These stupid Dream11 ads,1
Garg and Abhishek need to play till the 17th while keeping the scoreboard ticking at atleast 7RPO. Leave the rest to Samad and Rash.,2
Smash it around. Got no chance against CSK with less that 140 anyway.,1
Man wouldn't it be fun and endearing to see these two and Samad to follow take SRH to a good score,4
What do you guys reckon a good total would be here?,1
Jadeja getting smacked in these conditions too. OMG.,1
Can someone explain what is the auction rules next year,1
Jadejas out of form and getting belted by everyone this time,5
Abhishek making up for his front foot defence now,4
[deleted],-4
This middle order is depressing . Giving me Deccan Chargers vibes (after 2011),8
**95.1**,4
Bravo is a spinner who doesn't spin the ball,5
Only can Imagine Irfan Pathan losing his shit not seeing Abdul samad bat above these two  üò≠ü§£,4
Does bravo need such a long runup to bowl his pace,4
Wtf Bravo 95 kmph lmao,4
Didn't sharma score like 40 odd off 20 a year or two ago,6
Bravo's surprise delivery is the quicker one.,92
Lmao 95 KM/H,9
For Jadeja this is the best innings to redeem his bowling this season.,3
"I like how this Abhishek dude is batting, seems to be in control and is quite confident.",6
It's fucking boring watching Chennai ffs. Even though we're winning or losing its been a long time since I'm excited watching a Chennai game. Dhoni and Fleming selected a squad which has no excitement factor whatsoever. Let go of so many young Chennai guys and got experienced guys. Fucking give us the mega auction now and let's be done with oldies ffs.,5
Bravo can easily get away with full toss balls on leg cause he bowls really slow,3
[Bairstow shook](https://imgur.com/4rqG7XF),4
Irritates the hell out of me watching bravo bowling those slow cutters....,2
Haha dugout is more chilled today.,6
"Let the records show that when all overseas Batsmen failed, Manish Pandey scored.",6
It's time for youngsters to shine?,2
Guys CSK matches you should just smoke up and watch chill,3
Garg looked good with that flick over there.,3
I'm excited to see how Abdul samad does today,3
Falut was of both. But Garg was ball watching and not responding to his partner's call. A sensible non striker should've said No straight away giving Kanos that extra second. Both are to be blamed even if he's a 30YO GOAT or 19YO inexperienced bloke.,2
"Sometimes IPL throws these curve bowls!!

I want youngsters to do well but also CSK to win!! Can't be both!",5
TFW Kumble‚Äôs avg bowling speed is greater than Bravo‚Äôs,21
Samad and Abhishek to open next match,4
Why is Dhoni looking pissed as hell,6
"Jadeja be like, ""aap jake dream 11 pe team banalo, 95 km pe main hi phek deta hu bc""",18
Bravo screamed like someone kicked him in his family jewels there,10
What is the point of Garg?,3
all these mfs simp for kane when they should be simpin for faf,2
I want a good batsman to tonk bravo all over. Tewatia I'll pay you,3
Dhoni Review System fail again? What's happened to him?,1
SRH not making playoffs this year. They were literally carried by unreal ability of Warner to play through the innings. They haven't replaced Yusuf Pathan's experience in middle order. Vijay Shankar bubble has burst. Their bowling has declined too in the last two years. They look visibly weaker than the team which barely made top 4 last year.,4
Wow MSD missing another review...,0
" Piyush Chawla is the second-highest wicket-taking leg-spin bowler in IPL history and is hunting down Mishra for the top spot  


 1. Mishra - 96 wkts (147 matches) 

2. Chawla - 87 wkts (159 matches) 

3. Y Chahal - 83 wkts (86 matches)  

Cc: Cricvizanalyst",6
Inside edge right?,1
"Taylor: ""So that's how it is, is it? I turn away for two seconds and catch you out gallavanting with that floozy of a batting partner of yours!""

Williamson: ""Wait I can explain, please!""

Taylor: ""No, I'm sick of you going around wherever you please and getting run out with other men! Forget it Kane, it's Chinatown!""",16
One more wrong decision.,1
Gotta reach at least 140,1
Meanwhile VVs calculating how to bring out Murli Vijay to bat for CSK,4
"Gavaskar ""single aur double se kuch nahi banna hai"" üò≥",2
Fucking run Garg,5
Even if that was the wrong call Garg should have sacrificed himself instead of Kane for team‚Äôs sake,-4
What is a par score? 160? Not saying we can get it. But coming close to it would be good.,5
[deleted],9
IPL should have an Exciting team of the season award. It can make some teams like these two play active cricket.,2
Sharma totally turning it on now,7
man's got skills,3
Jaddu got robbed. Where is Dhoni review system :(,1
"Although Garg isn't at fault for the rumour, I still don't see a place for him in the team, at least after Vijay Shankar comes back",11
Abishek should open,3
Garg hasn't played a dot ball yet. Big improvement over his innings in the RCB match.,8
"Nice nice! This is the game for you, Abhishek. Just don't get carried away.",6
Fuck Garg just get out let Samad come,2
"Wow, Abhishek is batting with some backlift here!",4
Banger keeps calling this dude Abhishek Nair but isn't it Abhishek Sharma? That's what Google says his name is.,3
Abishek is looking solid,5
Srh improving pace,3
Abhishek didn't look terrible when he came on generally. He need some time on crease I guess.,8
[deleted],1
I played champion for my parents on the telly and then he gets hit for a four when I switch back :(,2
Sharma is doing great to hold his own,1
"5 to go with only 1 left for Bravo. Get to 150 somehow, lads.",2
From what I saw in the U19 wc Garg isn‚Äôt great,7
Bangar is wrong in so many levels. Its Abhishek Sharma ffs,10
"The 2018 under 19 world cup team might end up being one of those legendary youth teams. Shaw, Gill, Mavi, Nagarkoti, Porel, now Abhishek Sharma.",2
Abhishek Nair evadu bey..,6
"Bhosadi ke phir se Abhishek Nayar bola na toh TV pe chappal fekunga!

T: Stop calling him Abhishek Nayar ffs!",16
Now this is what i am talking about.... I N T E N T,3
CSK will be disappointed with anything above 150,2
Think they'll start going for big hits in this over,1
Why do they keep calling him Abhishek Nayar! The least they should know are all the names of the players playing the game,4
"Man, I want Dhoni to return to his 2019 hairdo. This looks odd.",4
"*Yay 100. guys ,are we winning ?*",3
"**True colors of SRH when Warner is not performing**

Warner's been team's spine since he joined SRH. Pity there's no Indian player to support him.",2
"If this two play good ,this can relieve lot of pressure for srh at top 3",1
"Mumbai were in a similar position yesterday right? But Pollard and Pandya were on strike, that's the difference. Excited to see what these young guys have for the last five",1
They were straying dangerously close to r/conspiracy territory in the Dugout there.,2
Ah time to jizz to 5 star Altroz,8
Are they glorifying the simps in that silk ad?,2
"Every team goes through a rebuilding phase. Even MI was rebuilding in 2014. CSK will be rebuilding in coming years and DC has been rebuilding over the past few years. 
 
Better than an IPL win would be if one of Sharma or Garg or Samad plays for India.",4
[removed],-21
"Garg is below Gill, Shaw, Jaiswal in picking order as a batter. Reminds me of KL of 2011 had potential but not power hitting game but in next 5 years everything changed. Garg need not to give up hope seeing Gill &  Shaw doing well.",5
Thakur is legit dinda academy,6
Csk and srh games are boring as hell.,3
These SRH fuckers are pretty good with 160 to defend if they get there.,8
Just me or is Shardul thicc AF,3
"Screw Bangar.

He calls Abhishek Sharma as Abhishek Nayyar

In some other match also he called Shreyas Gopal as Shreyas Iyer.

The least you can do as a commentator is get names of players right.",10
i would love to see SRH posting a competitive total just to test CSKs batting calibre,2
Shardul Thiccur has gotten Thiccer!,1
Fuckin garg,1
Make or break innings for Garg,0
"If any of you watched 2018 U-19 World Cup, Abhishek Sharma was 3rd best batsman in the team after Gill & Shaw but got overshadowed by Manjot Kalra, the age fudger who scored a ton in the finals.",15
Samad should have been batting instead of Garg.,1
Did someone tell Garh he can hit in the air?,2
VVS was better T20 player than Garg. Yes I just said that,8
Village,2
Garg batting reminds of Kaptain Karun.,5
Wtf was that shradhul,2
Why the fuck is garg is still playing technical shots ?,1
"Man, Pritam garg is being so tentative with his shot selection right now.",1
Dafaq Thakur,2
"TBF, if Abhishek can keep this up, SRH have a decent middle-order if Shankar can replace Garg.",5
Garg bhenchod you have only 5 overs left with 6 wickets in hand.,-1
Thakur didn't know where the stumps wereüòí,1
Lmao they ran 3,1
Some of the logo of sponsors on team‚Äôs top looks like someone forgot to use png files.,1
How is this guy made the captain?? Everyone except him seems to perform..,1
"SRH need to save Pandey for 5,6 or 7, and promote one of these youngsters to 3. Have Kane at 4. Give them a chance, and have them play around the better players. That should give the team a little more balance.",3
"Whenever Shankar is fit, Garg goes out. 

The batting and the bowling will stronger then",7
"There was never a 2 there, but they converted it into a 3. Wow",9
Bwahahaha makes you wonder how he managed to take a wicket,1
Hahaha Garg trolling us all,1
Garg should try to hit a boundary here and there.,4
Abishek Sharma just doesn't defend a bad ball because the team is in a tricky situation. You don't see that a lot.,3
Did Dhoni dye his hair and beard???,9
Garg has to hit. Samad Rashid can all hit.,3
So this game is turning out to be the snoozefest it was promised to be,2
Finally Garg,5
Nice shot Garg,3
"Dhoni captaining montage, vomit",-4
Garg redemption arc starts now ?,5
Why is he called kaptain karun? Because of DC captaincy once?,5
In b4 Garg redemption thread,20
That's the end for Lord Thakur.,10
This partnership is very impressive. Well played boys!!,9
Garg gonna do a tewatia now,20
Priyam Garg is getting ready to say big fuck you to r/cricket today,15
Garg is like *who's Wiliamson?*,3
Problem when Dhoni retires is that they have to find a keeper and a captain AND a middle order bat all at the same time. CSK should at least try to find a finisher next auction. All the other keepers are already snapped up by other teams.,1
Lol Faf got a direct hit.,2
Kane might just get dropped for Nabi because of these two now!,2
"Barkha singh is really cute üòçüòç
Edit: : amazon upi ad girl",2
KP sounding quite noncey here today.,2
Man that was a great shot from someone I have been shitting on.,11
"Why do they keep calling him Abhishek nayar. Abhishek Sharma has done well so far.

This reminds me of a time Abhishek nayar tonked Flintoff for  three sixes continuously  back when ipl started",9
"Feel like pure shit, just want big mad Jonny B to get some runs :(",5
What's with the soap opera music with Dhoni replays?,4
"Nice play from the youngsters, srh can get a commendable total of like 160 now",2
Can't believe Garg is 19 and dhoni is 39,8
"Win or lose.. the partnership so far will be a big boost to srh's confidence, considering that Abdul samad is yet to come",11
Totally unexpected stuff from these youngsters. Playing with so much composure,6
"Thakur is genuinely shit . Even after all these years , he still bowls the same .",11
That Pull Short tells me Garg has something in him. No fluke,6
Bitches garg striking at 150. Wait for 4 sixes in an over,2
Bc what is that 'bacche ko bachao' ad,13
150 with SRH bowling and CSK shit batting should be defendable.,4
Just learned the word 'gallimaufry' from Brett Lee,1
Abhishek Sharma's doing great out there,7
SRH needs at least 170 to defend,4
isnt jadeja bowling too flat?,3
"Garg for the win, keep playing like that",3
I miss my **Chak Chak Express** :(,3
"I know Garg is young and all, but given what his side was doing in the U19 Final, don't really have much respect for him. And he didn't even do anything in that tournament.",1
Great from the youngsters. Hope this fires up the others as well.,3
Is it just me or these Hotstar ads are really annoying,2
"So, is Special Ops any good?",7
" Spare a thought for Garg. It's always horrible when your teammate is angry at you, worse is when that teammate is Sage Williamson",25
Pls ruin bravo's figures. I have an irrational hate for his bowling,5
A netflix series following IPL teams would be awesome. In India though.,12
"fanboys dont hold warner and pandey responsible for gifting their wickets away, but blame garg for not sacrificing his wicket in the 3 seconds he had to mull the whole situation over. lols.",24
Still CSK can't even chase 140,0
Baby faced assassin is here,5
Guys whom should I bowl last two?,3
"Thakur, Unadkat, Umesh, Siraj would be a dream bowling attack............for every batting lineup",3
"Isn't there a rule that if one of the main Indian players injured, teams can play with 5 foreign players?",0
Gavaskar angry boner for unnecessary overthrow alert,3
"DC need to win tomorrow. To be honest, they need to always win.

Russell in Sharjah though!",1

"VVS called Abhishek, Garg and Samad top notch yesterday. He has high expectations from them and so do I.",1
CSK gonna play a test on this slow pitch,1
Is Sam Curran the only anomaly to the headband academy?,4
It's nice how they are getting extra runs through over throws,1
Ok the redemption arc is on,1
That's a beautiful shot,2
This is surprisingly good batting. I thought SRH would collapse.,2
Incoming tewatia jokes,2
Abhishek Sharma always had talent. It's just that he never had sufficient opportunities or overs to display that. Hope he grabs it today.,1
Shardul Thakur The Overthrow Expert.,3
This was a beautiful shot,2
Excellent slice,1
Lord Thakur with Maxwell level throwing skills,3
Garg making me eat shit!,4
Garg redeeming himself!!!,6
"Calling it, Shardul is getting murdered by Bravo by the end of the match",5
My boy Abhi trying to get Garg out cus he's a fan of Abdul Samad,1
Shardul been watching way too many Jadeja fielding compilation videos on YouTube.,9
Why is Sam curran so kawaiii?,4
Shot! Now I'm glad that Kanos got out. This 'Youngsters can't hit runs' myth needed to be busted.,5
Classy!,4
21(12),3
Garg is class,2
Garg redemption coming,6
Curran's hand actually allowed the second because it slowed it down,3
Yessss. Love seeing Curran get the thumping.,1
Get fucked r/cricket,3
Redemption arc is on bitches,6
"Right call imo

That looked very high",3
commentator said beautifully squirted away,2
"1000 IQ move by Kane to get run out, so that the middle order is tested before the playoffs.",7
*Ya baby that's what we want. Hit him hit him*,4
Garg with one huge middle finger to r/cricket,10
Wait thats not a No ball ?,1
Fuck this over c'mon,1
Oh God oh fuck,2
Damn!,2
160 incoming sadge,1
Garg just cunted that little nuisance Sam Curran back to back. He is a hero in my eyes.,5
I‚Äôm sorry for shit talking you Garg,5
This is lit,2
Curran ü§§,1
HOLY FUCK PRIYAM GARG WHERE WERE YOU ALL THIS TIME,1
Can't be mad at Curran,1
Redemption arc!,2
"Even if SRH loses the match, I will be happy because of this middle order performance so far... Go youngins...",3
No ball and four.....,1
Good fuckin lord!,1
Nice shot!!!,1
Damn I miss the nuclear alert alarm for free hits,1
We might have been pretty harsh on Garg earlier,3
Big brain move by Garg to get Kanos out tbh.,5
Garg doing a tewatia,4
Kane who? Garg is the real party,4
What was that!,1
Damn this dude can bat!,1

Unreal stuff mann. Woww,3
GaRg Is sHiT,5
What the fuck was that shot? Garg üëèüëèüëè,4
Is it possible that we reverse jinxed‚Ñ¢ Garg?,7
This is the best middle order we've ever had! God I'm crying,11
What the fuck,2
SRH you have a middle order.,10
Fucking amazing,5
Bro.....,3
"Wow, very costly over huh",1
"So refreshing to see uncapped players stepping up for their team , well done boys",4
Hmmm maybe Garg was right,6
Top 10 redemption arc?,3
This is superb from Garg,3
Folks who were doubting Garg got roasted.,2
Garg: Fuck r/cricket  Kane simps,9
Osho Rajneesh: What the fuck is going on here???,2
Unreal,2
Holy shit 64 off 38 partnership,3
"Pritam garg, remember the name",1
Omg Garg is Gold,1
Tewatia mode on,2
"Wow!! Damn you, Garg for making me feel good about Kane getting out early.",2
For the first time since 2013 young Indian batsmen are doing well for SRH! It‚Äôs always been the same names before today.,5
I wish CSK is more bold about giving chances to youngsters.,2
SRH needs to groom these players. They need to promote them and pair with experienced players instead of stacking them at the bottom.,6
"Who ever is watching Dugout stream, Brian Lara has more confidence in our Bois than the SRH fans themselves.",8
"Lmao, all the SRH fans who were asking Garg to sacrifice his  wicket are real quiet now.",4
64 run partnership of 38 balls. Both guys are 20 year old uncapped players.,5
Now  lets shit on Curran,1
King shit from Garg. Absolutely terrific,3
Wow this is the best Redemption arc,4
All the shankar fanbois shambles,2
r/cricket never learns. Even after Tewatia cunts here try to abuse a player for taking time at start of innings. Atleast wait until innings is over.,6
"*Drunk Praveen Kumar to me in Meerut Market in 2019*: "" Watch out for this kid Priyan Garg, he ain't overrated like Gill & Shaw samjhe bhosdike""",6
Love You Garg Im sorry,2

Wth playing like the best batsman in the league,5

Pag is fire! Damn,3
*SRH mAtChEs ArE bOrInG bRo*,10
Tewatia who? It's fucking Garg now,9
We've done it boys. Pissed off garg,10
"Feels like absolute shit man, just want Warner and Williamson back.",4
"Garg: Yeah r/cricket, talk nah.",12
Sam Curran channeling his inner Tom Curran.,6
Reverse jinx srh back?,5
"maybe just maybe, garg has confidence in his talent and thought he deserved more than just sacrificing his wicket to cater to someone's entitlement?",14
Surprised we don't see more runouts in these tournaments where people are just starting to play with each other. Heck.. Surprised we don't see more run outs in general these days. I remember how frequent comical run outs used to be as late as mid 2000's.,3
Bairstow n Kane vibing together,6
*Priaym Garg Redemption thread*,7
Curran singlehandedly throwing away all the good work lol,6
I feel just like how MI fans felt when Pandya murdered Negi in 2015 vs CSK.,2
When was the last time SRH middle order played well. This is so amazing.,6
Wow SRH do know their team and believe I them,4
"Not active here today, but I guess people would have been shitting on Garg earlier today.",8
Not exactly as dramatic as Tewatia but SRH will take it.,5
It's hilarious how every day a player fucks r/cricket,10
"Okay I regret whatever I said about Garg, come on mate we need to win the match!",5
Damn Garg dipped his dick in r/cricket's ass,7
I have decided to not shit on anyone even in jest.,4
We're looking good for 165+ here.,2
Brooooo SRH is now a playoff team. Wow!! üôèüëå,1
"People who were saying Garg should have sacrificed his wicket for Kane, get fucked",4
"SRH really turned it around, I thought they were done",3
Kanos sacrificed himself cus he saw the vision's,4
I swear If India don‚Äôt win every global tournament for the next 15 years with this crop of youngsters.. they shouldn‚Äôt play cricket again,4
"Run Rate before this over: 6.93

After this over: 7.82",6
Your apology should be as loud as your disrespect.,8
Been a lot of teams having slow starts then explosive last 5/6 overs so far,1
"Brilliant from Garg, he's so calm",2
Okay don‚Äôt feel about losing to SRH now!,2
"I miss my team ,Deccan Chargers üòû",5
Shankar's IPL career over,4
Hyderabad's found their middle order that they needed,1
Why is a 19 year old youngster not sacrificing his wicket for 30 year old GOAT? Because he has to back himself to score and not give up himself for Kane's stupidity.,2
Why do I feel Bravo is gonna go for a lot of runs now?,2
"man, Shardul must be jealous of Curran for having 22 in just one over",1
So Garg is indeed like *who's Wiliamson?*,1
"Imo, Garg should have sacrificed himself",1
"1 from Thakur, 1 from Curran and 1 from Bravo?",1
Chahar seems such a hittable bowler who is rarely hit.,2
"Thankfully, Garg had enough self-esteem to not sacrifice his wicket.",1
Thank you Jaddu,2
"Garg won the battle of ""Chota packet bada Dhamaka"" lmao",2
What did garg do wrong? I missed it,1
Haha! Wtf.. Haha..,1
Are you fuckin kidding me???,1
"Garg actually plays a bit like Williamson, those dabs and placement.",3
Lol,2
Jadeja's fielding is also failing him now.,2
Seriously Jadeja. Can't believe my eyes,6
Wtf is wrong with you CSK?,5
"Jadeja just dropped a catch, I repeat jadeja just dropped  a catch",2
Jadeja having a very bad IPL so far,1
Jaddu dropping catches is 2020,4
Literally Juniors vs Senior and Juniors winning it,2

Chahar getting the authentic 90s Srinath experience with this catching,3
Thakur is a fucking shit player,2
FUCKING HELL BRO! WTF???????,2
"Would love to see a youngster's eleven with Abhishek, Garg, Gill, Shaw, Mavi, Nagarkoti, Mujeeb etc face an experienced eleven with Watson, Faf, Dhoni, Pollard, Gayle, Steyn, Umesh, Mishra, Tahir, Chawla etc",1
Garg is inside their heads after the last over,1
What in the name of CSFUCK is this bullshittery.,3
Calm down yo. It was not needed at all.,1
Lol 2 in a row,1
Well. Let's pack it up bois!,2
Holy shit.,1
Ran 1 poor running!,1
"Haha lmao, thank you god",1
Suspicious!,1
I don't like moustache Warner,1
MS fumin inside lmao,1
After jadeja drops one what can I expect of anyone else?,2
Wtf csk,1
p h i l d i n g,5
Why are they dropping catches,2
Someone tell Lord that juggling is done in a circus!,1
Circus,1
You know 2020 is fucked when even Jadeja drops a catch,2
"Can't even blame flood lights, this ain't Hyderabad Stadium.",2
Thakur proving that he is still shit after all this years.,2
Thakur YOU FUCK,1
OK.... This is CSK WE KNOW AND LOVE... not that FAF bullshit at Ropes,1
Chennai showing their loyalty to Sun TV üíØüíØ,3
What is it about Dubai? I am pretty sure we have seen most dropped catches here this season.,5
"never really understood the srh middle order slander, for this year, at least. we're investing in young talent. sort of like a rebuild. give them time!",1
Abhishek on Felix felicis,5
holy crap this is feisty stuff from these two. loving it,1
How can Sir Dhoni expect to win another IPL playing with these bums dropping dollys,1
CSK used 100% of their good luck quota in 2018,5
This partnership is making me as happy as winning the match. Bodes well not just for next matches but will let Warner play freely not having to worry about fragile middle order.,7
This is comedic now,2
SRH kids to CSK senior citizens - Sorry Babu,7
"I swear that clipped the thigh pad?

Harsh wide?",1
The top order making way for Youngsters,2
Csk are failing this catching practice miserably.,1
WHY,1
CSK gave up early today,5
WHAT DID GARG DO WRONG? ANSWER ME,2
Still Rashid and Samad left to hit sixes.,3
[removed],7
Hope those dropped catches cost them the match .,6
"Everyone trying so hard to be RCB

Leave it to the experts",10
Punda baadu thakur why do you even play,1
"Commentators praising chennai fielding earlier and chennai fielders dropping sitters.

Why I am not surprised?

F commentators curse.",2
"Wait I've seen this one  before 


*Looks up KXIP vs MI*",2
"Fielder dropped a catch

Camera man : I'm going to end your career.",4
What happened to Jadeja. Expensive bowling and dropped catches. Smh,7
Dhoni has started doing NRR calculations in his head lol,6
Bullet throw from Kedar,1
CSK gonna start playing for NRR from ball 0,4
normies have started the fixing thread on social media,3
CSK = RCB,2
Cheating SRH have greased the ball up,3
I've not seen many juggling acts where they drop stuff every 30s tbh,3
CSK: I've achieved comedy,3
Fuck sunny g and Indians pointing fingers at sky,3
"Seriously, is there something especially with the lights out there in Dubai. So many drop catches",7
"Priyam Garg, you have earned my respect...",5
Srh have a middle order :0,7
CSK are trying their hardest to throw away the great position they were in,7
2 continues balls 2 drops. Suspicious as fuck.,1
"Sunil ""pointing fingers skywards"" Gavaskar",6
Kanos : I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes where SRH develops a middle order . Garg : How many did you see? Kanos  :  1 in 40 million,10
Jadeja dropped a catch... 2020 has showed me everything now,8
Garg is using his bottom hand so we'll. He vibing Koach+Kanos hard.,4
GARG not a single ugly shot till now.,10
The next gen of Indian cricket will really push this generation. They are all supremely atheltic.,7
This is the luck we needed,5
Dying to watch Praveen Kumar's comm while Garg bats,3
175 looks real now,1
Gavaskar loves this IPL. Gets to repeatedly say that Indians can't catch the ball with hands facing the sky,5
How is this possible? I can't believe it.,2
CSK building the confidence of young Indian players - to recruit them for next season. 4D strategy.,6
I call shenanigans.,2
Hopefully this partnership gives the top 4 the confidence to go hard earlier,2
This is how you fuck up a potentially good start,5
Shambles,3
Everything going SRHs way rn...for a change,0
"Jadeja dropping catches, conceding 10 runs an over on average this season, maybe he needs Manjrekar in the commentary box to motivate him.",8
"This is massive for SRH. If Warner Bairstow can trust the middle order, there is no beating SRH!",6
Goddamn Garg,3
41 off 18 lol that is ridiculous,7
Kanos was probably dismissed for the best. Brought out the best in these two,5
Ok people i have to say this..does anyone else thinks Shardul's drop was intentional?,2
Who said CSK don't give opportunities to youngsters? They're singlehandedly promoting Indian youngsters today.,17
Insult to injury,2
[deleted],2
Butter everywhere,1
"Get Samad in now, please.",2
CSK fielders sanitized their hands with essential oils,8
"Genuinely happy to see some fight in our middle order, gg Bois.",3
Chennai 'Safe fielding unit' Super Kings,5
Lmao wtf,2
"we cant chase this, with our snail-paced batting lineup",3
It's hard being CSK fan this season. Is this how RCB fans feel every year,11
"Obviously wouldn't have wanted SRH middle order to gain form right before the game against us, but I don't mind coz these 2 youngsters are just too good and I was waiting for them to shine",8
All happening here.,2
Whats with good fielders like Kohli and Jaddu dropping catches in Abu Dhabi? Does the 'ring of fire' makes it harder to see the ball?,4
"Cant tell if our middle order is doing well so far because of the shitty fielding or because they‚Äôre playing good, either way it‚Äôs nice to see",7
Go Chargers Deccan Chargers..oopss Go Sunrisers,8
76 off 44. How impressive is that! Srh is golden now. Jackpot!,7
"If Pakistan players do it, we will abuse them for fixing lol. 

This shit reminds of Ajay Jadeja missing catches in the 90's",0
Im actually crying rn ;_;,6
Look at the srh dugout is reacting to this thumping. They are not surprised. They look assured.,4
Sloppy max,2
"Ball hitting the top edge

Sunny G: Clever little nudge",8
25 more of 2,2
This is the team version of doing a tewatia... And i am here for this..,8
Death bowling has been shit by most teams so far,2
"Sunny G giving boundary credit to Garg , when he clearly mis-hit !!!",6
Feel bad for chahar here,1
Can fixing in UAE be prosecuted in India?,2
Kane‚Äôs runout could prove to be blessing in disguise for SRH‚Äôs middle order.,5
"Y'all plebs think these are mistakes

This is the Curse of the 3D",5
Only Sunny G will consider a top edge a good shot. Wtf,6
Just started watching and Jadeja dropped a catch?? 2020 really turns things around,5
What's with garg and praveen kumar?,4
Garg's in their head. What a legend,4
I haven't seen a harder throw from CSK what the fuck?,4
Csk just want to test their batting depth. It's all planned.,6
"last 16 balls, 45 runs conceded.. jesus chrsit csk, get a grip ffs",10
[deleted],8
Finally,1
"Fucking finally,,,,",2
Been taking fielding lessons from Leics,1
Samad time,3
"Can Gavaskar please stop saying this finger position bullshit. It's shitty fielding full stop, nothing to do about how you catch the ball.",1
"This is why there is 4 overseas player limit in IPL. On some days it feels like teams are carrying passengers, but more often than not they happen to be Indian Youngsters craving for chances at the top level. Beautiful reminder from Garg.",5
Garg's last 8-9 ball strike rate should be well above 250,2
Felix felicis ran out.,8
6 over ago.. Felt like wheels were going to fall apart from SRH. Now it's CSK who look like they're fall apart from the seams.,2
Please don't club kohli with jaddu. Kohli has been dropping sitters for a while now,5
vijay shankar applauding but crying inside. man just lost his place in the 11,11
Abhishek's flicks ü§§,4
"Finally, well played abhishek",2
"It is funny people are now praising Kanos for Garg's batting even if it is a joke. Earlier, they were blaming Garg for Kane's fuck up.",2
Well played Abhishek.,2
[I called it and y'all downvoted me. smh. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j3t9bb/match_thread_14th_match_chennai_super_kings_v/g7enwtw?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),1

"Dhoni: 1 Lord, Sir: 0",4
Job fucking done,1
Meanwhile KW getting animated in the dugout and showing who's fault it was.,1
"Deserved wicket for Chahar tbf

So many drops this over",3
How is MS not even pissed right now?,5
If Dhoni dropped that I was gonna become an RCB fan,10
How will 3d make it back into the team now?,4
Intent from Abhishek is great,7
I never expected this from the SRH batting line-up.,6
"It's okay, Abhishek. You did your job perfectly. Outscored YJB, Warner, Pandey and Kanos.",17
"Moral of the story, give all the fielders some gloves",6
Samad on his way!,4
Out 3 times in 3 balls. Amazing!,8
Every fucking time a newbie kills CSK.. remember valthathy? Bisla? Now this Garg..,18
Samad time letzooo,4
Good inning by Abhishek. Now don't leak runs.,3
"Abhishek was living dangerously for a while, hope Rashid can hit so e juicy hits",3
"Imagine chennai to capitalise on a good position, not my team",6
Finally someone caught the fucking ball.,6
"Why did dhoni caught that.

Did he not get the memo.",8
"props to the young lads, i dont care, if one of them is out.. did their job well with confidence.. amazing to watch. even as an opposition",20
Poor Chahar,2
"Thank Lord Tewatia this place isn't like Google's comment panel. Yeah, we may have the same jokes 80% of the time, but that place is *the* Wikipedian cemetery.

"**17.6** Chahar to Abhishek Sharma, OUT, **caught behind.** Well, it's one out of three for CSK in the over. It ends Sharma's innings - the one that injected pace into the middle overs for them. It's a slower short ball, he looks for the pull, gets an edge behind and Chahar is beaming ironically as he finally gets one **146-5**

Abhishek Sharma c &dagger;Dhoni b Chahar 31 (24b 4x4 1x6) SR: 129.16",4

"Most competitive IPL ever due to no real home ground advantage. CSK and SRH were near impregnable in their home fortress in India.

Garg giving the old guys a good spanking,9
Both Garg and Samad were apparently signed after Laxman personally watched them play. No wonder he's looking on like a proud father.,20
Kanos would be proud with that cow corner slog.,7
Man this Garg is something else,7
All part of Thala's master plan.....‚òπÔ∏è,4
"Damn this guy really exploded 
 
really didn't expect this from him",6
Seeing Bravo going for runs is always satisfying,6
Well done Abhishek. Now over to Samad and Rashid to hit a couple of sixes each.,7
It‚Äôs so hard to support this team,1
Okay this Garg dude is seriously good!,12
"He saw that slower one coming a mile ago, brilliant strokeplay from Garg so far",6
Boys we reached 150!!!! Yay,7
CSK going full KXIP/RCB now.,5
I want a interview with Kanos and Garg together after this innings.,6
Garg redemption arc completed,7
Where's the garg redemption thread bois,8
[Mitchell Santner](https://i.ibb.co/rsV0DGt/Screenshot-from-2020-10-02-21-04-02.png) is absolutely bored.,10
Seems like Kane should sacrifice his wicket for Garg next time,6
That ball deserved beating. Slower ball ain't a surprise if you bowl it 5 times in an over.,2
CSK is a trash team this year. No doubt about it.,3
Should've wrapped it up at 130-140. CSK is just being sloppy by giving away 20-30 more runs than they should've.,1
Bravo is so damn overrated in final overs.,2
"Through that angry stare, Kane transferred all his superpowers to Priyam.",9
VVS laxman feels like a proud father seeing Garg,3
monkaW,1
He's a quick boi,2
"Yeah Star, keep showing ads until after the bowler has released the ball. Fuck you.",2
Great partnership but still it is CSK's game to lose with their long batting lineup. Just hope Dhoni doesn't go in his NRR calculating mode early in the chase.,2
"GARG

Who is this guy",3
Never talk shit about our middle order again,7
ms looks maddd,1
"Sunny G orgasming over those ""young, fresh legs""",6
I am confused. Is the pitch like how warner played or how These two and Pandey played?,5
"Garg doing the only thing he could to face the fan heat, and he has done well. His team and Kane will only embrace him with open arms obviously. Don't shit on the youngster even if this is the only thing he ever does.",20
"If I were a CSK fan, I'd be absolutely fuming if Thakur got another game.

It's not just the dropped catch, that unnecessary overthrow kept Garg on strike and the rest of the over was ruined. He bowls absolute pies and Idk what he contributes to the team tbh. 

Rather give a young pacer a game or just play Karn Sharma and 3 pacers --- Sam Curran, Bravo and Chahar is enough.",30
Well played Priyam Garg. You have arrived.,5
Thanks for the grin Ms Varma,7
Oooohh two matches tomorrow nice.,11
"Sunny G commentary checklist : 

1. Indians not used to catching palm facing upwards
2. Take single after boundary

Not watching guys. What's Bravo's fastest delivery?,3
Terrific innings from this guy,4
No one looked at 68% drop percentage.,7

Shardul for last over?,3
"After Garg's fuck you to r/cricket

Someone should really keep a log of amount of fuck yous to r/cricket",6
Warner smiling like 'Oh shit we had a middle order after all',9
Lol who would've expected this turn-around,6
Very clean innings. Superb innings Garg.,5
Garg really did not want to face Kane's wrath,8
Atleast 10+ in last over please,6
so happy for garg! go get 'em!,5
CSK are at the top of the fairplay table because they drop catches on purpose to give more chances to young players like Abishek Sharma,8
Well played Garg,3
"The last time Warner was that happy, he was still making tik told for the Indian audience.",7
"If any parent thinks a chocolate cereal can make your kid more active, you need to go back to school!",9
"Ha. Mastermind move by Kanos to force Garg to take responsibility and improve the 'so called' long SRH tail.

50 (23). 19 years old. Batted kid!",8
50(23) for Priyam Garg,3
He was U19 Captain.,1
It'd tough for CSK to chase anything more than 170,1
I‚Äôm surprised Bayliss has an IPL gig after KKR fiasco and that they got rid of Moody,1
Sunrisers might have their Indian Core with Garg and Abhishek Sharma,1
Safe to say Garg saved his SRH career and our middle order.,3
160+ and having Dhoni plays against you plus SRH bowl well. Damn Garg has won this for SRH!,0
A 19 year old guy just smashed CSK bowlers out of the park,3
"Who is going first? I will. ""wHen Is HE plAyiNg fOR InDIA""?",2
Garg wouldn't have this fire in him if he didn't get Kanos out.,3
Why does CSK have no one like this,1
Did SRH finally find that young indian talent,2
"Paddikal, Gill, now Garg. Promising batsman",3
Bruh,1
Pretty Ass Garg,2
These CRED ads are hilarious,3
"Warner really changed since he first came in cricket huh. He seems like the dad of Srh now, just look at that smile when Garg got his 50",1
"As much as I like SRH, I hate I fucking detest the missed catches. Puts me off completely and I think its fixing.

CSK gonna lose this. No way this meme team is gonna make even 150-160 against SRH bowling.,1
Hope SRH manage the youngster well. So much potential,2
"Difference between me and Garg is , at 19 Garg was scoring his first half century whereas I am here pleading to my friends that I am not the impostor in among us.",9
"Given the way Garg ran btwn the wickets, it is evident that is not the best call from Kane and also some inertia from Garg.",2
How much was Garg picked for?,2
Garg look like he is 16...,1
CSK has R Sai Kishore and they don't play him. Karthik would be fuming his main weapon for TN is warming benches when CSK's spinners are doing shit also.,2
170 moral victory. Rashid coming,1

lmao fucking CSK deserves this,7
what in the actual fuck,4
CSK seem really sloppy after the one week break. Hope it doesn't affect their batting,6
4th life,1
LMAO THAKUR YOU FUCK FACE,2

Lmaooooo üö®üö®,2
Vijay gave more fantasy points than this shitshow Shardul,7
IF I WANTED THIS TORTURE ID WATCH SRI LANKA HIGHLIGHTS WTF,35
All that angry staring for a no ball. Lol Thakur.,7
"He could've got Samad out at the non striker's end. Instead, he decided to bowl a no ball.",1
He didn't try to catch it because another drop would have just taken the cake.,1
Bruh you better bowl a good death over for that shit,2
Thakur should never exist.,1
Did Bravo just dance after taking a catch of a youngster who belted the shit out of them..... Only to find out that Thakur overstepped? Lmao,11
"What is wrong with CSK?...is this what they practiced during the break? Dropped catches, no balls.....",7
Hotdamn that dude Garg is 19 years of age!! I cant even hit a football at 23.,12
shardul pulling off an ngidi here,5
This is beautiful,3
"**Indian player to score an IPL fifty in less than 25 balls for SRH**

Why does Tharkul even exits ffs,5
That stare tho,4
Missed you Lord Thakur,2
C'mon just 4 sixes,2
scripted,-1
Kanos lauding in the back after that stare will make my day,12
"Thakur should be dropped, just not good enough",1
Well done Garg 50(23). Even Kane wouldn't have played so fast. Thanks for not throwing your wicket away,17
Looks like csk finally found their death overs length,2
"With all due applause to Garg's innings, I think he feels that his job is done after the 50. He hit that full toss to get a single to reach his 50. And now just hitting it blindly. Shouldn't get complacent.",11
Never seen Bravo as animated as he is today.,1
Experienced bowler stares down 19 year old kid who's handed his team their asses. Calm the fuck down Shardul. It wasn't even a legal ball.,47
That was actually a good ball,2
BC get to 170 at least now.,7

Great running out here,3
Samad swinging too hard and ignoring timing.,4
That's not a knuckle ball,1

Absolutely shut fielding by CSK this match,5
anything less than 10 runs this over is a miracle,3
Shardul's figures are OK. Why is everyone dissing him? Again not watching,8
"Damn, quality yorkers",6
CSK are absolutely baffled at how these kids are running 2s!,22
Why is Rayudu fazed,6
Honestly a good over.... All things considered,1
Garg should've played at 4 in 2019 wc /s,8
Brain fade for CSK fielders,2
People shitting on thakur and he's bowling perfect Yorkers now,14
"77-run partnership between Priyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma is the highest stand between two players of age 20 or less in IPL history. Previous highest: 36* between V Kohli and M Pandey, RCB v DC, 2009.",17
"Shardul was staring at Sam for not standing at the wickets to intercept the throw. Now he does the same thing. Do what I say, not do what I do.",10
Good innings by Garg - made up for the run out.,3
"Priyam Garg has just hit the joint fourth fastest 50 in this tournament, tied with AB de Villiers on 23 balls.

The fastest was hit by Sanju Samson off just 19 deliveries.",11
"Honest to god, barring that no ball pie this has been a good over!",3
Great over this despite the no ball!,6
"Regardless of how Thakur is, this over was pretty amazing.",12
You know these guys are Dravid's pupils. The fundamentals are so strong. Brilliant running.,10
This this is why I will never look down upon ‚Äúmankading‚Äù. The bowler can be an inch above the line and he has to re bowl it giving the batsmen a free hit. Everything from that ball is discredited. The batsmen can‚Äôt be stealing yards on the name of the ‚Äúspirit of the game‚Äù.,77
That's a comeback bro,3

Good over,2

Thakur being csks best death bowler is peak 2020,27
Still It'll be tough for csk take my word,3
Sharpreet thumrah,3
Was that not a wide?,3
Fuck all. Thakur has bowled excellent final over even with that no ball.,10
Not a bad final over from Thakur there,3
Alright i lost all hope for this CSK team with that poor fielding. Wtf was Bravo doing.,4
Good bowling from thakur there.,3
"with that bowling and fielding, I don't know how we restricted them to 164.",8
Wow that was actually a good over,6
6 short but what a comeback !!! Won't be a snoozefest for sure!,3
Lmao this whole sub was advocating on dropping garg after last match,10
CSK have been poor in fielding today,5
*Angry Morgan noises*,3
Good comeback from Shardul. Proud of you man.,7
At one stage SRH looked like they would be bundled for less than 120. Credit to the young boys who took on the mantle. Gg SRH!,10
"Meh, I think they should have got at least 170. But I can‚Äôt complain too much, I thought they wouldn‚Äôt even make 120 at one point. Good shit Garg and Sharma",12
Well played lads.,3
Garg should have tried to play most of the last over,5
That 20 run Curran over is gonna come back to haunt CSK just like the 20 Run Ngidi over did in the match against RR.,11
Last ball was a wide,2
How was that not a wide?,1
"FUCK!!! bowled well shardul, what an over man!",1
In the midbreak Akash Chopra praised CSK's ability of not dropping catches lol,8
Good comeback by both teams. Interesting second innings coming up,4
Thakur bowling a decent death over is something I didn't expect,10
Samad was trying hard to hit all the bowls.,4
r/cricket clowned on Garg and Thakur. Great innings by Garg and a good last over from Thakur.,19
Bois let's just admit it. That was a damn good final over in a 20/20.,18
Even with a no ball that was a good over,3
Very impressed by Abhishek and Garg. Went from 69/4 to 164/5.,8
"If Bhuvi and Rashid are as good as their last match, SRH win this.",3
I want hazlegod back. Why you do this CSK?,1
Happy to see these domestic guys stepping up,4
Not quite enough for CSK to give up but with good power play bowling it might work out.,3
So what do you think? Is it enough? I have PTSD from previous CSK vs SRH matches.,11
"Brilliant last over by Thakur!!

Just have to correct his Noball issue. Not the first time he has missed wickets due to this.",4
"CSK conceded 64 off their last 5 overs, predominantly to Priyam Garg (someone who is considered a T20 misfit) after drafting in a specialist death bowler in the form of Dwyane Bravo. 

That's pretty embarrassing tbf.",13
"Just rewatched, the ball that kane got run out on was clearly his fault. Garg never ran and it was a good call by him. Don't know why some guys were shitting on him earlier.",15
Warner standing like a proud dad seeing his son shotgun a beer for the first time,23
"Now r/cricket will hail Garg. Lol

But anyway he played an amazing innings",9
Thakur with his own little redemption,5
I think this is enough for SRH to defend against CSK.,2
"Four Yorkers. Four fucking Yorkers in last over. That too by shardul fucking thakur.


Content with the score tho...",33
Rayadu to unleash his anger on Hyderabad now.,9
Expect nothing less than 24 yorkers from Natrajan,9
Curran failed with the ball today tbh.,4
"So used to Thakur giving sixes in the last over, I really liked what he showed at the last over",7
Man It'd orgasmic if Abhishek Sharma can take wickets too now,9
Good last over there by Thakur.,2
Gentle reminder this ground has 68% drop even though that doesn't matter in today drops.,3
Momentum is massively with SRH now,3
"165 is a decent target , SRH has a banger bowling attack",11
"Ben cutting scored 20+ in 2016 final's last over, since then I don't remember us scoring great in final over (may be Rashid Vs KKR).",9
Good last over there by Thakur.,2
Alright NRR chase now.,2
69/4 in 11 overs. 2 uncapped Indians not having faced a ball on the crease. 95 in 9 overs follows,7
"160 vs csk is like 200, somehow csk will make it 100 off 8 overs:/",10
[deleted],31
"Me wondering why Thakur is getting shit for a 7 run over with 4 great Yorkers!

r/cricket : it's the law!",9
Pritam garg played a Williamson like innings. Full of class,7
[Garg as soon as he gets back to the dressing room](https://i.imgur.com/Bji0LMJ.png),6
"Good to see young talent dooing well, specially young Punjabi talent in Abhishek specially after seeing KXIP clowing all our local talents including our fucking captain on the bench",10
"Watching the youngsters bat like this makes me immensely happy, I dont know why",6
180 was on the cards. Excellent last 2 overs.,8
Like always if someone can defend it then it is SRH.,7
Abishek triggered it. Garg carried it,8
"Now after that thakuls over , I m looking forward to Natarajan dishing out those Yorkers",9
This Sharma interview makes me realise these are kids and I have been harsh. I feel bad now.,25
"Please bhuvi, would love to see you swing one right into Watson and clean bowl him",29
"If CSK can't chase this total with this batting lineup, they are finishing last this year.",12
Time for another 145/4 in 20 overs by csk,21
Good death over by Shardul. 164 is about par score and SRH have bowling to defend but CSK are to watch with in form Rayudu and Faf,17
"young player mentions natural game in his speech

""Ah I see you are a man of culture""",33
Abhi playing mind games with the runs required.,10
That over from Bravo is exactly what Dhoni was missing,19
"I'm really happy for Garg. To see him score runs especially when the senior players had let down, the potential was always there huh",25
Went from Thakur getting trolled over the no-ball to him nailing those yorkers.. never change r/cricket,19
Ambati gonna open today or will they go for an unconventional thing like Sam Curran?,5
Our bowling is usually good except when it's not and that usually happens against CSK. I'm still nervous.,6
"I don't know how the match will go from here on out, but the way these 2 kids picked up the mantle makes me a proud Laxman.",6
only lord umesh succumbs to r/cricket's trolls and never does a comeback,55
Both the teams are inconsistent and hence expect unpredictable outcomes.,7
"With India's population and it's love of the game, we really should be dominating every single tournament. It's time we shed hero worshipping and backed youngsters.",34
"**SRH batsmen today**

Age 20 and less (Priyam, Abhishek, Samad)

90 (56), 10 fours, 2 sixes 

Youngsters leading the charge in this Game for SRH",58
CSK is kill?,3
Guys now shit on Khaleel. Come do it. A good performance is due,37
Wheres the redemption thread for my boy Garg !!!!!!,21
Nope. To watch CSK Chasing SRH still makes me anxious....Cries in 2018,38
This ipl seems to be all about youngsters,24
"Ambati watson faf, just need to make sure dhoni, jadha, jaddu don't bat.",13
CSK lost the plot for a little while but overall it was a great bowling performance tbh. Our pace options look great. Now if only we can find some way to fit Tahir into the team.,14
"SRH win or lose will be decided in the first 6 overs.. Dry them out and rashid will take care of the rest, give them runs and it is csk's game to lose..",7
"KP praising a young Garg for sending Williamson back while he publicly blamed young Kohli for not sacrificing his wicket in a run out back when they were in RCB! 

This guy is some hypocrite!",15
"Bravo looks like he‚Äôs struggling to run, and yet he‚Äôs playing today. He was desperately needed in the csk squad",4
Watson when chasing vs SRH = God,15
"Jadeja looks like a deer caught in the headlights this season. He's been shit as a batsman all along, in this format. These days looks clueless with the ball and has now started dropping sitters. 

Time to remind him that he is not entitled a place in the side.",24
"**SRH while defending below 165 target vs CSK**

"Faf takes a stunner.

I dont know how CSK will see through Khaleel,13
"Great job from the youngsters but feels like Warner and the top order let the team down by 20 runs. 

It might be hard to bat at the start but if they can make 70 in the first 10 overs without losing too many wickets, it should be an easy win for CSK.",7
i bet garg was under massive pressure after the whole run out fiasco. he handled it darn well.,19
Double header tomorrow. How will they play in such heat?,8
Combined age of Abhishek Sharma and Priyam Garg is equal to MS Dhoni's age.,76
This was just bad bowling and fielding in the second half. Straight up.,4
"Everyone has literally memed Garg, Tewatia, Shardul, Kishan into performing",78
NGL Watson still triggers 2018 PTSD,36
Looks Samad will be getting a over today.,8
Khaleel is next in the meme tier surely,5
"UUUUUUUHHHHHHHH......
Great analysis by KP as always",3
Bhuvi need to work his magic with the swinging ball and get two early wickets of Watson/Faf/Rayudu for us to have a chance.,3
How is Jadeja still in this team? Avg. 11 with the bat and 71 with the ball (ER > 10). And he's not even fielding well.,0
Petition to give Tahir Indian citizenship,12

"Idk what happened to Jaddu, last i saw him perform was vs NZ",4
"Watto vs rashid, here we go..",6
CSK are favourites to win on betting sites. Sportsbet has them at 1.72 and SRH at 2.10. Should I bet on SRH?,5
"Feed me our routine Strangle Job‚Ñ¢, Boys. Wicket by Bhuvi at front, Rash putting the brake in the middle and some Yorker corkers at the end. Get in!",5

That was Shardul's first no ball in IPL. After 707 balls in the tournament.,10

Warney coming through with the pornstache,2
"Really impressed by Garg today. After the Williamson runout mishap, it would have been very easy for him to be extra aggressive and try needless things to get out. 

But, he showed the composure to build the innings slowly, and then go berserk in the final overs. Really encouraging stuff for SRH if the 3 young Indian middle order players can click.",12
I have a feeling this year would be Watson's last year in the IPL,1
"Virat Kohli dropped 2 catches vs MI

Manish Pandey dropped catch vs KKR

CSK got this easy peasy. That was a fantastic comeback but not going to be enough.,5

Duplesi Duplesi take it easy policy,21
"Win or loss, I don't care. But I am happy that it gives the likes of Warner, bairstow and Williamson some confidence of not carrying the burden of the entire batting and that lets them play freely. They've been pretty uncharacteristic so far",81

[deleted],8
Big inswinger there,1
What an inswinger wow,2

"Watson got nothin on Bhuvi, man he's just outclassed",7

How did that not hit the stumps?,3

That inswinger from bhuvi is lovely.,4
So the NRR saving snoozefest begins with a typical Test Match style over.,5
Now get nattu in...,2
This is like old Bhuvi with those banana inswings,9
Damn Watson is not able to read Bhuvi's inswingers.,5
"After that over, srh fans: boobie > boobies (probably)",2
Watson should not play Bhuvi man. He might get out at any given ball.,1
couple of wickets in powerplay plz. make this spicy for us neutrals.,4
Watto on lbw watch then?,1
I know it's a meme but why is Watson so susceptible to a LBW?,1
Damn where is he getting all that swing from? Crazy!,3
WIN TOSS LOSE MATCH,2
Lovely inswing in that over! Vintage Bhuvi!,5
"Lol wk saying ""not easy"" in the Dream 11 ad, nice reference",1

Khaleel is a specialist swing bolwer,4
Damn that 1st over was straight fire,11
PP prediction: 23-1,3
CSK look to make 20 on the current NRR,5
CSK have to target the 4 overs of Abhishek Sharma today. Could be a weak link in their bowling attack.,8
Bhuvi is master of the ball.,7
Does anybody remember the commentator who said that it was a blessing in disguise for SRH that their top order collapsed after Kane's wicket?,9
Good test match. Love watching SRH matches just for their quality bowling and the effort the fielders put in to cover their shitty batting,13
Abhishek Sharma's overs are the biggest concern,3
Faf's stance is aggressive as fuck,5

I still think not letting Gaekwad open is a very bad move. He will not succeed at 4 if team scores 60 runs in first 10 overs.,3
fuck off CSK. Seriously?,4
Hopefully Bhuvi bowls 3 overs in the powerplay today. Need the early wickets. No point in holding two of his overs back for the later stages.,4
Really don't want csk to win,3
Dhoni can't drop watto cz then he'll say the same thing about dhoni too,5

No.. i hate this slow start.. I'm not falling for this again.,6

Is it me or do I see more Hyd fans here. I wasnt expecting that,3
Bhuvi deserves a wicket now,8

Even some1 like K Khaleel is bowling well. Ya CSK you are done,5

"Watson is gone... SRH win by default.. YEAHHHH
....",1
"Wow, Bhuvi in form",2
Do you give Bhuvi 3 overs in a row if he's going to be bowling this well with the new ball??,1
We are better off replacing Watto with Gaikwad and Thakur with Hazelwood,2
What is this chase from CSK?,1
Dhoni will come two down and dick us watch. This is all getting set up for that,3
"Hazelwood over Watto for me , they can open with Kedar/Raydu with this kinda deep batting order.",1
Bhuvi deserved that so much,6
Just a matter of time that was,1

"I think quite a few CSK players are playing their farewell season, whether they know it or not.",1
"Bhuvi kept at this line because he knew it will fetch him wickets, he may not have the highest pace but he‚Äôs smart as fuck",7
why is watto so vulnerable to bhuvi tbh,5
Time to replace Watson maybe. We have no one,6
CSK is kill,6
Bangar giving Lee and Lara a proper Indian youtuber explanation. Look how quickly they learnt about swing üòé,2
Imagine how hard srh fans nutted when they won't found out thier 2018 nightmare is out,2

Lose trying to win. But if they replicate the pathetic chases from 2nd and 3rd match. I am done for the season.,1
Csk goona make this chase interesting their batting line-up is to good to not chase it but then they will let run rate go above 10 and then chase with some heroics from lower order....,2
Pitch definitely slows down A LOT in the second innnings in UAE. Bat first win guaranteed,5
Did Watson just say Ben Stokes?,5
Please Ambati.,9
2018 final vibes,11
It‚Äôs time to drop Watson. Play an Indian batsman (not Vijay) and get Tahir in.,6
CSK please retire,13
Watson is gone. We need to get Rayudu asap.,11
It's game on!,5
Time to do commentary Watson,15
Is it time to play for NRR yet?,5
My apologies if events take the opposite route of what I commented. I‚Äôm just keeping track of the score through reddit. So there might be a slight delay.,3
Rayudu is an issue. He can play Rash effectively in the middle overs.,12
Glad to see bhuvi doing well with this shot at test cricket,6
Rayudu living dangerously with a quick 2(2).,8
CSK old timers know this probably their last season together so they are trying to spend time out on the field regardless of win/loss,11
"12 year old me took lesser chances than Watson to get it right for completing ""Demolition Man"" mission on GTA Vice city.",19
Wow crowd going mad for Rayudu's singles,23
Bhuvi is looking lethal,5
The best batsmen of csk in the middle,1
Why is Bhuvi called Bhindu Kumar?,-1
My heart.,1
rayudu needs to open not faf,1
but who could've known that opening with two slow starters would lead to a slow start?,5
"Ppl always talking about Dhoni's impact, Look at Raina's impact on CSK",7
Nevert would have thought we would be relying so much on Rayadu to win this year,4
This would be a big over. Rip khaleel,3

It's pretty weird how CSK don't have a backup overseas batsman. Can't even drop Watson without changing the overseas composition of the team.,1
Can't wait for mega auction,3
7/1 after 3 overs wtf CSK,2
Doesn‚Äôt Watson look like buffed up version of Mahesh Babu (popular Hyderabad movie star)?,9
half of CSK players aren't fit for this format,5

One good thing is that the batting is deep so they can keep trying to go for the win today,4
who is up for RCB 2008 vs CSK 2020?,4
Enough with Watson . Plays 1 good innings out of 4/5 games. Slow on the field. Swap Watson with Santner and have Santner open as a hitter like Narine. CSK is too slow at the top.,1

Wait. The ball hit the stumps but the bails didn‚Äôt fall. They fell because of his hand.,11
Looks out,1
LMAO,3
Fuck my ducking life,1
That's the match then,1
Thats out,1
This is good stuff!,1
OUT,1
Thala time methinks,4
This will be messy,1
Out?,2
Jadhav most useless player ever confirmed,5
Come on third umpire find a loop hole,3
CSk fans need to calm the f down. We know nattu is from TN and their selectors missed the chance to grab just like in RAYUDU case. Just calm down.,10
"Not gonna lie.

Johnny had us in the first half.",6
Hahahahahaha,2
1 run ‚ô•Ô∏è,2
Show front or back view idiots,5
"Well, thats one way to take the bails off.",5
Outttttt,7
that‚Äôs gloves,4
Incredible from Sunrisers. Incredible,6
"Jaan-e-Bairstow did the Bottle-e-Match  

Edit: WTF that's not the ball üòØ",7
Jadhav!!!!!!!!! You bastard,1
That‚Äôs out baby,8
how's that out?,4
this will be controversial af lmao,5
That's out... Jeez CSK!,4
"LMAO, TF IS THAT",8
Guys what happened? Sorry to ask again but yeah.,4
What a shame,3
Looks like CSK of 2018 is back. Where someone or the other would start hitting a few boundaries as soon as there is a wicket to not allow bowlers to get their tales up.,2
I made my disheeshin,3
Johnny is so lucky,0
BAIRSTOW HAHAHAHAHAHAH,4
Wooden Spoon here we come - CSK,6
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!!!,4
Awsome work by johny,6
Bairstow almost fucked it up,2
T.T,1
Thala time,1
CSK's last hope gone,4
GG fad du pussy.,5
Match khatam. So jao.,3
Bairstow you beautiful ginger beauty.,8
Searching for rope on Amazon,3
COLLAPSE INCOMING,5
Bairstow CLUTCHED that,6
The best batsman for both teams run out,5
Game over,2
"Faf is gone, nice.",6
Wait what,1
Nice. The leg bail! Brilliant indeed,2
That shouldnt be out imo,9
Garg literally can go no wrong today lmao,3
That looked very close. What a brave decision!,0
"Oh boy

Surely Dhoni has to come out now",1
A run out for a run out. Perfectly balanced,5
Those lighting bails are awesome.,3
That's a big wicket,5
"Fucking Jadhav!!

Hit it in hand called for a single!!",5
Lmao...the only batsman except Samuel who doesn't shut shop is gone,3
Faf is 36. He should be made short term captain after Dhoni retires,9
Strangle Job‚Ñ¢ perfected.,4
"I was happy at the thought that was Kedar, but wow early night then",6
Orange cap is safe with kxip,6
Weak ass running. Ffs.,0
Now Garg has repaid for runout too,5
That was controversial. Ball didn't dislodge the bails. Bairstow's hands did it  Am I wrong?,3
How tf is that out? The ball wasn't in the hand,7
How many chances of Dhoni still not coming ?,1
In what world is that possibly out???,6
fuck,1
Dhoni show today. it's due,3
Is csk the new rcb,2
There goes CSK's hopes.,1
"Clearly out, see the bail of the side where ball hit dropped not where his hand was",2
Bairstow saved himself from a spanking,2
Bairstow redemption arc on the horizon,1
OMG DHONI IN BOISSSS,3
Jadhav is the imposter in the CSK 11.,3
I'd rather play with 10 men than with Jadhav,3
Aisa Naako karo re,1
Should get Abhishek and samad to ball out 2-3 overs right now,3
"Remember back in 2018 when CSK used to rack up 200+ totals for fun after KJ got injured!

And in 2019, no big totals close to 200 whenever KJ batted for them! 

I'm seeing a pattern here now!",3
[deleted],1
"**5.6** Natarajan to Jadhav, OUT, **the bails are off at the striker's end, Faf appears to be short.**Oh boy this is going to be controversial, I can already tell. Bairstow is sprinting towards the stumps as midwicket's throw comes in on the bounce. He uses his momentum to push it on the half volley towards the stumps. The ball hits the stumps, BUT, so does Bairstow. Seemingly at the same time. **36-3**

F du Plessis run out (Garg/&dagger;Bairstow) 22 (19b 4x4 0x6) SR: 115.78",2
Bairstow: It may not have looked like it but I fully planned this runout,11
No way Dhoni comes in with Rashid not even bowling a ball.,3
Scene is set perfectly for a Mahendra Singh Tewatia innings.,9
"That is not out. Because the stump lit up when Bairstows gloves and leg hit it, not the ball.",1
CSK is in trouble now,2
Didn't his gloves knock the bails off? The impact from the ball didn't seem to have disturbed the bails,6
I hate CSK with all my guts but that was not out. It was Jimmy‚Äôs foot that broke the stumps. The ball hit the stumps but it didn‚Äôt do anything to the stumps.,1
Send in Curran let's see some sixes,6
we aren't qualifying this season i guess,2
"Okay Kedar , just, you know, like just, fuck off man",3
That is out. The leg stump led went on,4
That's not the ball! The ball bounced harmlessly off the stumps and the gloves knocked the bail off. How blind do you have to be üëÄ,6
Time for MS to step up,2
"That should be not out, he needed to take the stump out",1
"They should make the crowd chant dhenier, i'd appreciate that",2
""" Thala dhoni is nothing without Chabhi Raina""- My Grandpa 2015




- How badly I want this to be wrong",3
"Grag is AIR, he is everywhere today",1
I don‚Äôt want to win in this cursed year anyway,2
Dreading the Thala Redemption,3
"So stupid. If CSK can't win against us, they should write this year off.",3
Dhoni at 5: YA R/CRICKET! TALK NA!,3
Dhoni about to get a lot of batting practice today,4
Very nearly bottled that,1
You need one of those 10000 frame rate cameras for that. Sucks it went against us but it is what it is.,6
"Dhoni at 5 this time, interesting",1
The ball did hit the stumps but I reckon his gloves actually made the bells come off,4
"He had us in the second 1/3rd, not gonna lie",4
Jhadav was always a big chutiya.,3
It's out imo.,2
Jadhav to run 2 more batsmen out before pulling his own hamstring,2
Rashid v Dhoni is gonna be a cracker!,1
"That was bad luck, was looking forward to Faf's fireworks",2
Am I missing something here??!!! Didn‚Äôt look like the ball hitting the stumps knocked the bail off!!!!,3
Bowl Abhishek now. Thala will eat dot balls like a Christmas eve dinner.,9
Some relief for du Plessis' back from carrying CSK,5
F for Faf,2
Dhoni in. Now RRR will go to 20+,3
Thalaaa,1
OMG we all got what we wanted now. Dhenier is in.,1
Should we be happy that Dhoni is in?,2
Ngl I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs out,7
I think that injury hampered Faf's running. Not to mention that he started late and committed to the run only because Jadhav continued to run.,1
That was not out.,3
Is there any hope here Bois?,1
Lmao.. it's already above 9 rpo for csk,2
Rashid Vs dhoni is bad for csk,2
Bring back Badrinath.,2
Clearly the glove hit the stump first and if it was the ball how did both the bails fly out?,2
Rashid vs dhoni.. going to be fun,2
This game is SRH's for sure now,2
What do i see here.,1
Great now Faf's gone,1
"Watch Dhoni get bowled by Rashid.

He has struggled to pick his googlies(entire world has but Dhoni has serious issues).",0
Atleast Faf can take care of his back now after carrying CSK,3
That was a good decision from the 3rd Ump! The left bail would have fallen first if Bairstow hit his gloves!,9
Is this the night that r/cricket finally memes Dhoni into form? Or is his familiar foe Rashid going to get him again?,4
YJ ‚Äúmakes things happen‚Äù B,7
"Wait, is that actually the rule? The ball pretty clearly didn't take the bails off, the gloves did. 

In those situations where the ball trickles backwards and hits the stumps without taking off the bails, all the WK has to do is go and punch the stumps?",2
"Sorry but the umpiring this IPL has been fucking catastrophic... That is simply not out. 

The ball hits the stumps, does NOT dislodge the bails, then he clearly hits it with his gloves to knock the bails off... That is NOT out.",1
Oooo controversial but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs out,3
Lol dhenier is here bois. Take that r/cricket,5
When was the last time Dhoni came in at 7th over?,4
Predict Dhoni‚Äôs score,1
I feel that‚Äôs not out,4
Faf to Kedar after taking run: What are you doing K?,3
I don't think that's out tho. Tough call,3
"Feel bad for Raf, was in good form throughout the tournament 55, 72, 44, now out at 22 from a run out.",2
Thala's balls are on the line now,1
"That's world fucking class or absolutely just pure luck from Bairstow. 

Not at all complaining",18

14 overs to go. Please MS. Please.,2
"Thala and Jadhav. Time to take it deeeeeeeep! 72 off 12, pressure on bowling team deep.",9
Lol srh batsmen can boost any team's bowling confidence. And Srh bowlers can make any team rethink about their battling strength.,10
Definitely carrying an injury there,3
Fuck Kedar Jadhav All my homies hate Kedar Jadhav,6
"‚Äúfuck how‚Äôs that out?‚Äù

‚Äúfuck that‚Äôs out‚Äù

Vicissitudes of life",4
Dhoni coming up the order. Will be fun to watch either way,3
"Oh god, this is exact situation where Dhoni will play tuk tuk game.",5
"Scott Styris: ""Even the SRH fans are delighted to see Dhoni. That says it all""

&#x200B;

There goes his contract",45
Jadhav straight up ball watching. Fucking ass hole. Drop all these fools,4
"Trump gets COVID, Dhoni walks out at 5. 

2020.",45
"Now that Dhoni is here, I would be disappointed if he does not take CSK to victory.",5
Only 14 overs left of the first day so batting team sends nightwatchman,4
inb4 Dhoni makes rr 15 (CSK will still win if Dhoni stays),5
Thala w no helmet in bois,3
Typical dhoni Jadhav partnership gonna start and end the game for csk,3
Dhoni is last hope for both teams. :D,3
That is baller move from Dhoni to walk out without a hat on and have a minion follow to hand him the hat when he gets to the middle.,12
Faf took it too casually,1
India vs England flashbacks,2
Now comes can't do not bad by commentators Thala,1
"Abhishek is 19 year old, dhoni is 39",4
"Haha, love Dhenier's prod forward and defense approach.",1
Let the test innings begin.,1
Only SRH can help redeem MS,3
Lets see if the r/cricket curse going to work on Dhoni,4
Front foot defenseüòéüòéüòé,6
The bail that went off was over the stump ball hit. Bairstow touched the opposite stump whose bail dislodged later.,13
Csk is paying Jadhav 6 around crores and Faf 1.6 crs.,7
Thala has no intent for helmet today,4
Dhoni SR watch: 50,2
Here comes trademark Dhoni and jadhav 60 run partnership in 8 overs,3
DEEP INCOMING!,2
when was the last time MS was in so early...ummmm..,6
[deleted],10
whos the aggressor in this partnership?,4
Casual cricket from CSK,4
The memes are gonna write themselves now.,2
Why is KP orgasming over a single? What is with IPL commentators and Dhoni?,3
damn faf was robbed,2
idk but players from both teams look dead inside today.,2
Jadhav got Faf out to play with his best friend Dhoni,8
"Haha CSK fans got scapegoat for the loss already, GlOvE nOt BaLl",7
Scenes if Dhoni is a reddit user and was baiting r/cricket for this long to extract maximum ‚ÄúSaVaGeNeSs^TM‚Äù,0
You can tell Jadhav feels bad with that powerful swing lol. Rarely see him take those,4
 KP getting very excited about another mans bat.,7
now we've to watch the great Jadhav shitshow allover again,1
Shitshow again from CSK,2
I fear that today might be the day Dhoni plays his annual IPL innings. He has got a lot of time to settle in while chasing a score that isn't too big,1
And the commentators have started creaming their pants over MSD,4
I miss Gambhir the captain whenever MSD comes in to bat. Bring in the slips and short-leg.,2
Go through Abhishek's overs quickly before they decide to attack him.,1
"I'm watching the match in PC, father is watching it in TV. I can already hear him scolding Dhoni.",3
Today it'd be good to judge dhoni he'll get enough balls,2
How did the 3rd ump come to conclusion that the gloves did not dislodge the bails,2
"If this is how KP reacts to Dhoni's bat, just wait until he sees my penis",10
KP has started simping already,6
"Dhoni, produce a mesmerizing innings and leave r/cricket in the mud.",8
England vs India wc19 nightmare flashbacks,3
Common guys Dhoni is still there.,2
"Against SRH, Dhoni has 395 runs in 13 innings at an average of 56.42 and the strike rate of 150.19, with 4 fifties.",13
SRH has a golden opportunity to let Abhishek finish his 4 when these grandpas are batting.,9
Up the order??? mans coming in at 5...,20
Book title for CSK's 2020 season. CSK: The art of defeat,6
"Now dhoni has all the time in the world to get in rhythm.

That excuse will not work today.",13
Nice time for Abhishek to bowl,3
"r/cricket, please work your magic and meme Dhenier and Jadhav back into form.",11
"Dhoni comes in.

r/cricket comedians: it‚Äôs my time to shine",21
"We should not underestimate and reverse-reverse-jinx MSD.

Anything can happen.",10
Why are the commentators jizzing over Dhoni‚Äôs bat size?,9
"Easy win for SRH, Rashid will run through this line up like a lawn mower",6
Its your day Jadhav,1
Jadhav just wanted to bat with the MSbigD so he ran Faf du out.,6

That‚Äôs not a sentence I ever thought id write but it is technically correct.",7
"Why are sunrisers so good man?

&#x200B;

everyone in their team has an orange cap.   What a team!",21
"CSK are doing us a favour playing shit this year. If they don't play well they don't make the top 4. If they don't make the top 4 then they don't make the final. If they don't make the final, then there is no chance of us seeing Mitch Santner duck the last ball of the innings in a final",7
Fuck I'm waiting for RR v RCB already,5
Tuk tuk ACTIVATED,2
Commentators jacking off to Dhoni already,14
This aint over yet guys. Remember CSK bat deep,6
"Yes, the much awaited ‚Äúcontest‚Äù between dhoni and rashid",4
"Imagine if Dhoni for real completed the chase, vintage style. People would be diabolical.",5
Ngl CSk might overdose on Viagra by the end of the tournament seeing how difficult it is going deeper.,8
Look at these CRED ads,2
The stage is all set rashid... Do your thing...,2
For everyone saying not out . watch the replay again . the right bail went out and not the left . its clearly out.,6
Maybe Faf wasn't 100% and winded after that blow. We never know. No point assigning blame to anyone.,0
"Let's see if Jadhav can do what Garg did , pretty stupid of him to get faf out",2
what the fuck can the commentators chill a bit he literally just hit a single...,2
[deleted],1
CSK batting till XI today. There's no way they're losing.,8
I don't blame commentators. They need contracts for the next year too,11
Ngl dhoni in a chase is still terrifying,28
Redemption on Gandhi Jayanti by Dhoni?,4
CSK traded victories against every other team to win against MI,10
And I was wondering how Abhisek Sharma would complete his 4 overs against a big batting line-up!,6
Wicket incoming,3
"Damn this will be good! 

YRKFA vs MSD",9
Rashid come on boy,8
Dhoni will play out Rashid taking dots and singles and take his team to victory by going bang bang at end.,11
Future of Indian cricket sure looks bright but the present doesn't look as great,11
Gambhir captaining Rash against Dhenier would've been the most beautiful sight.,8
Rashid to Dhoni is what Bhuvi is to Watson,13
Isn't Dhoni a good player of spin?,3
"The left bail would have fallen first if he had gloved it before the ball broke them. The right bail fell first, which means the stumps were ""first"" broken by the ball. Fair decision.",9
"Rashid to take 7 in his 4 overs

You heard it here first",7
"I respect the Paralympic athlete and all, but what business does she have being in a coding advert. Do people just accept anything that comes their way.",9
Rashid back in form,2
"Next year's Chennai team is going to look very different.

Watson and Dhoni are playing their last season for sure.",3
Dhoni down the crease to defend count: 1,4
MS doesn't need the full face of the bat to defend. What solid defence. What precision,3
Reverse jinx is for sissies.,2
This commentator ready to cum just talking about dhonis bat,2
"Tbh, as a CSK fan, I'd be perfectly happy if CSK don't make the playoffs. This team has given me enough heart attacks, I think 1 year without any heart problems is deserved.",2
Ffs try to score of Abhishek at least. The only player keeping RR in check is gone. How tf have they gone to shit so bad. Sad and painful,2
"With these two at the crease, the T20 match now morphes neatly into ODI mid-overs",2
Minnows CSK finding it difficult as usual.,0
This is a crucial pair SRH needs to get rid off.,3
CSK gonna have a big Quantun of Loss again today,2
Is Faf the least paid player in this lineup?,1
"Come on Dhoni, show us you still got it. Say a big fu to r/cricket",6
I am very happy Dhoni changed his cursed beard. That was hard to look at.,3
I wouldn't be surprised if Dhoni wins this match coming back to form. This guy has always been immense against us. I am almost too numb to be hurt by losing to csk.,13
Gambhir would have gotten a short leg for Dhoni,10
Haha! Calm down Kanos.,4
"Dhoni's worst nightmare this- a gun legspinner, and the weak link(who dhoni usually targets later) in the bowling team, who also happens to be a left armer spinner, bowling from both ends now...",10
Yes Jadhav nice solid defense mate,2
Is subtle spin at a higher pace easier to face than a high degree of spin but slightly slower?,2
"Kohli: I have no fear man

But that thing(left armer, even if that's a 12 year old from boost and)

It scares me",8
Csk just don‚Äôt give a fuck,6
[deleted],9
Hate me all you want but MSD is big credit hoe and not technically sound at all(Batting),1
Typical dhoni - Jadhav,2
Jadhav please get out,8
FORWARD DEFENCE OH YEAH BOY,4
"Now this is a contest.

Not that 250 run chases at sharjah.",8
The run rate in the next 5 overs is gonna be less than 6. Might as well take a break.,5
Got to go after Abhishek,4
Rashid is legitimately a fun bowler to watch. Every ball is a potentially wicket taking delivery.,14
"None of the commentators have mentioned Street smart yet, Interesting.",3
Tuk tuk dhoni - Jadhav express,5
"Why is Dhoni 3 from 5 and not 30 from 5, is this a Test or what",7
"Dont defend man, atleast rotate the strike",5
"Unpopular opinion, I am becoming a fan of Bangar's commentary. loving his measured and calculated approach. Some relief from constant blabbering.",6
Standings 7&8 being displayed is a bit unnecessary,5
"Proper forward defense. This is just infuriating.

Play for singles you fucks. Those might become dots obviously but Atleast try.",7
Rashid just get Dhoni and you are done for the day.,6
Only way commentators are gonna criticise dhoni is buy taking tewatia's name,4
[deleted],5
"A bit late but don't know how you can even dispute that run-out. Ball hits the right stump first, the right bail starts to dislodge. Glove flicks the left stump during/after. Some of y'all are blind.",3
Guys no need to panic and lose wickets before late tea,2
As a csk fan this is just sad to watch.,8
It's already above 10 rpo,2
"Unpopular Opinion: I think Dhoni in his yesteryears could have been a decent test player and should have retired from LOI's instead in 2014 /s

Edit- /s",6
Narine Dhoni PTSD,1
Rashid is getting difficult to play with every match. He is getting his form back.,3
"They always talk about Rashid like no ones ever faced him before and no one has any idea how to face him.

In reality, it‚Äôs quite simple, you imagine you‚Äôre Eoin Morgan during the World Cup and just keep putting him in the stands.",11
I wonder how Rashid Khan would've gone on uncovered pitches.,3
Another ODI being played by csk,5
"Why not send Curran as Pinch hitter in powerplay, if they can't boundaries",1

Why tf is jadhav even playing? A player like him shouldn‚Äôt feature for csk leave alone Indian team,3
"I know Lord Dhoni gonna win the game, first he's going to taje it DEEP then unleash hits when RRR is over 36",1
Does anyone else find Akash Chopra annoying?,2
"No matter how even if for some seasons teams like DC get good bowlers,  SRH bowling is the goat",3
When and how was the dream 11 ad shot?,1
"Now that Garg and Abhishek have performed and Samad has showed a glimpse of his talent, what should be done with 3D if he‚Äôs fit? He provides bowling utility but super unreliable with the bat.",8
These people seriously don‚Äôt realize that they‚Äôre wasting valuable overs,3
Had Csk ever lost three matches in a row?,3
Dhoni gonna play well tonight,7
Give srh bowlers at least 160 to defend and they start to look like 1990s Pakistan bowling.,26
This pair is going to lose the match for csk. They have hitters to come. They'll leave them 5 overs to try with 15 per over required,3
what a catch,5
Jadhav might be only player in history who bowled better for RCB and DC than CSK,10
fuck you Jadhav. gtfo,7
Why the fuck would he catch him,4
"Mentioning the over vs Trescothick are they.

So a young active bowler against a 40 year old former pro is a good contest then",1
Even if csk loses it I guess they won't their fans in twitter has got a perfect scapegoat to blame. Happy the team is SRH and not MI otherwise alll the Ambani crying would have started,5
Classic Jadhav,6
Wow this is Chad level choking!,6
Bad news for SRH this,6
That's a bomb catch,11
Aah mf,5
I just can't believe this,8
Yea csk play jadhav nah,2
Thanks jadhav for doing us all a favor and getting the fuck out,8

Hate this team,3
Jadhav might be the worst specialist batsman in the IPL and I'm not even exaggerating.,2
Jadhav as reliable as always,3
"This Samad guy bowls like a park cricketer

Edit: And he got a Wicket LMFAOOO",5
Impostor has been ejected.,3
I'm celebrating this wicket as a csk fan,8
Didnt know Samad can bowl. We have a 6th bowler boys,5
Beautiful,2
Csk fans more happy,6
We might see CSK get all out chasing. I don't think we seen that in a really long time,6
That was a shambolic innings from Jadhav,3
CSK fans celebrating as Jadhav departs,7
CSK's falling apart,1
hehehehhe gone,3
Wait. What just happened?,2
Fucking Get INNNNN!!,3
Why the hell are they celebrating,2
Shouldn't have caught that,3
3 off 10 by Jadhav. Proper CSK innings that.,9
How does Jadhav have a job.. he's fucking useless,3
PASSION from Warner,4
Terminate Jadhav's contract pls,5
"I'm still apprehensive about our chances. I've seen Dhenier butcher Boobie even when he was at his peak. And hitting Yorkers isn't very difficult for him either, so Nattu threat will be nullified. The trick is, have Dhenier eat as much dots as possible and then get him out while he's trying to accelerate.",8
"Jadhav did his part : he got out the only in-form batsman of CSK, he got 3 runs off 10 balls",5
Over/under on all out by 70?,3
Will CSK even score 60 by the end of 10 over? Ohh a wicket fell again,2
brb gonna go off myself for believing we‚Äôd win something,1
"Finally chutiya got out, thanks for getting FAF runout you cunt",2
Losing wickets just before tea. Bad judgement,2
Innnnah thala,1

"Awh man, That's a big hit for SRH",5
Srini mama make the call.,0
Jadhav only wasted 10 balls today. Thats great see u next match man,3
One friend goes other one comes in,4

To think I came into this game optimistic,3
Is it just me or are both teams extremely aggressive today?,1
The target is to not do worse than rcb48,1

This is just sad,2

Yup SRH's winning,4
Yes kedar get the fuck out.,5

As a csk fan I'll take that,4
Jadhav MoM for SRH,10
CSK Brand is done.,12
Looks like csk is a joke without Raina/harbajan/tahir,8
Wow I feel like an idiot for wanting SRH to give CSK Williamson in exchange for Jadhav.,9
‚ÄúWhy is no one thinking of the NRR?‚Äù - Dhoni right now,10
LMAO imagine getting out to a bowler filling 5th bowling option quota,7
"Jadhav is making bank. Being a shit player and getting 6 crs. And the bench strength is so bad, you still get a chance to play.",11
Srh the King of defending totals,12
[deleted],1
Nooooooooo! Kedar was important for a SRH victory,10
This bowling line up can defend any score!,9
"Garg, Sharma and samad middle order is doing more than the middle order in the previous 4-5 seasons.",14
Entire CSK making up for not playing Vijay today by playing like Vijay,14
49 is a lucky number. What you say csk?,5
End the misery Jadhav and Dhoni. Too slow even for odi,5
Kedhar gave away his wicket....for political reasons,8
"What an innings, got Faf run out and then scored 3 off 9",16
Good to see a player from  Kashmir getting his first wicket. A talented youngster to look forward to.,8
If sunrisers batted second they would‚Äôve  gotten smoked too relax,1
CSK: We don‚Äôt play for NRR. In fact we don‚Äôt care about it at all.,8
Ffs. They really brought on part time leg spinner and got a wicket. üò≠,13
NRR Protocol has been initiated,10
Senior player boosting the morale of a youngster by gifting him a wicket. Nice,9
Our boys saw you cunts talking shit about us in the first two games.,7
Hopefully csk starts fresh and doesn't retain anyone,3
"bowler : woh catch dikh raha hai?

warner : ha,pakad liya!

bowler : nai pakadna tha.",33
Lmao imagine getting out to samad,1
Jadhav knew people would've blamed him even if he stayed,6
that footage of dhoni shadow batting gets me every time,1
Atleast with Dhoni NRR won't go down now.,2
Poor Jadeja probably wondering why he always has to bat with Dhoni.,3
So this is probably that year? I was expecting this some time but maybe after Dhoni probably retired from the IPL,3
Jadhav is waste body,2
[removed],7
Whatsa good replacement for Jadhav in next match?,0
I don't think I've ever seen SRH beat CSK in my life... Maybe today is the day I can watch it live!,2
[deleted],3
can csk get banned again for a year so we can drop everyone,-2
Al of Csk should have retired in 2018.,3
Send in sam,1
"I'd argue that club football is on a higher level than international football.

Reckon it will ever be that way for cricket?",0
CSK would be better off starting with a clean slate next year. Also promote Dhoni to the team mentor position,1
"Jadhav would've been dropped,benched, released and retired if he was playing in some other franchise, but CSK, man I don't understand CSK",1
csk doesn't even have a backup for Jadhav,1
Dhoni keeps kedar in the team only so that he does not become the only tuk tuk player.,1
perfectly set up for Dhoni to stay not out and lose by 20 runs.,3
"Where is Sandeep, he shud replace Khaleel",1
"Csk seem to be some kind of charity for veterans before they bow out. Kedar Jhadav gets paid 6 crores per season and with the amount of runs he scores , its like 3 lakhs per run.",7
NRR time bois,6
"I didn't forget , r/cricket calling SRH the worst team just after 2 games lol",9
Man I wonder how Raina must be feeling right now watching this!,3
How many ads am I gonna see with Virat Kohli in them?,8

"Either you die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villian.

"Kedar Jadhav 7.8Cr
Karn Sharma 5Cr
Fucking Murali Vijay 2Cr

Faf 1.6Cr

Smh",41
"I like Jadhav. He has another dimension to him. He doesn't just get out alone, he takes a set batsmen like Faf with him.",11
"Okay CSK actually looks complete dogshit. Not anyone in particular, the entire batting lineup. That they cantered to 200 even once looks like a miracle in hindsight",11
Without Raina CSK is nothing man. its showing,10
CSK should really invest in some young talents. There's absolutely no life in their innings.,5
[deleted],2
The guy who is most hurt is tiwari not the fat one,3
"Jadhav is a fucking asshole, ran out our only batsman and played tuk tuk. He needs to fuck off",11
Fantastic analysis by Styris!,1
Sabko batting milegi?,5
how old is samad?,3
"Is Jadhav's father a MLA, goon or some underworld don?..üòÇ
Never understood why is he in a cricketing team?
What work does he have in a cricket ground?",9
"I think CSK should drop Jadhav and put vijay in middle order next match. Vijay having problems starting at the top, middle order might ease him in and he can play the big shots later on",1
No wonder Jadhav loves Salman Khan. He is getting paid a lot of money for doing nothing extraordinary just like his idol.,41
"Jhadav: As a marathi, I dont wanna bat with Bihari lmao",23
"Is there any team carrying as many passengers as CSK. I mean so far -- VJ, Twatto, Jadeja, Jadhav, Chawla and a few others have done absolutely fuck all.",12
Not sure if Jadhav gone is a good or bad thing for SRH,8
How the fuck does Jadhav gets in national team when he isn‚Äôt even decent in IPL.,11
Samad to Jadhav: Skeet Skeet Bang Bang Niga,2
And Jadhav's still gonna end up in the Indian squad,6
Semi final PTSD intensifies,11
howwww is jadhav still on the national team year after year?,4
CSK look like they've just given up this year tbh.,3
"Abdul""warne""samad",11
Jaddu can smack it too. But should've been sam,5
"In a game of 120 balls, 3(10) is such a horrible fucking innings dude",9
We're finishing last this season,10
Oh yeah another product CSK is on the crease.,4
"Right arm leg spinner coming around the wicket to left handed batsman, has anybody seen this before?",2
Does Vijay Shankar get back into this team if fit?,9
damn warner‚Äôs not holding back today,12
Man watching a proud Murali clap is wholesome!,12
WC Semifinal flashbacks,8
CSK have gone from CSK to BSDK real soon,33
"Samad is quite the looker! Team's stacked with em: Bhuvi, Kanos and Abhishek too :D",7
Warner overexcited,3
He is just 18.,6
Laxman Murali laughing like: fucking hell I can't believe he smashed that straight to the fielder!,12
Oh he's opted for the BAS Vampire early,4
"That's why I put my money behind Samad at the starts of the season. He's young, might be expensive in a couple of matches. But he's someone who we can genuinely trust to deliver one way or another.",9
"Et tu, muralitharan?",11
"No one:

That one sound effect: honk honk honk honk SQUEAK SQUEAK",6
Jadhav one of the few players to have gotten worse after leaving RCB,3
Majority of CSK team would look better sitting alongside VVS and Murali than in the stadium,5
Jadeja is proper bits and pieces player in T20,1
I don't want CSK to collapse. Dhoni fans will justify his slow game with this excuse,4
damn CSKs batting looking bleak AF.. everytime either Faf or Raydu has to redeem them.. others not even trying.. might be the worst season for CSK..,1
Is my memory shit or has Jadeja actually played an innings of substance ever in IPL?,1
[deleted],2
Are you ready for the Finisher,0
Really nice to see murlidharan,1
That was the over they were supposed to target,-1
"Jadhav may not bat, bowl, keep or field, but he manages to convince everyone that he's a good player. Talent.",10
"What were csk even doing in these 7 days, they're just making the same mistake again",3
Murali revenge against Dhoni for WC11 - Some newspaper or redditor probably.,7
"That is a very, very good over for someone who's an all-rounder and has never bowled a ball in the IPL before. Great control.",2
Muralitharan coaching Rashid is another level of OP that deserves an immediate nerf.,20
Excellent over that,1
Not a good chase from CSK at the moment,2
"/r/cricket will lose their mind if Dhoni can win this game from here. 


And that‚Äôs a big IF.",4
"Last match somebody said, Rusty Thala will be well oiled today.

I hope He don't leak too much of it and we will have to call it shit.",1
"As an MI fan, it kinda hurts to see CSK playing like this but the owners bought it on themselves going for batsmen nearing the end of their prime. I guess it paid off 2 seasons at least. I see CSK going for a full reboot next season as likely many of their squad members will retire/go unsold.",7
"It honestly look like even though CSK would like to win, they‚Äôre fine with losing too",1
Virat Warner eh?,3
[deleted],2
4 (9),1
Won't be a better opportunity for Dhoni to shut down his critics.,4
Test match standard - beautiful can we get some slips?,3
SRH fielding is the GOAT,2
Ruturaj would have given a great company to Dhoni and made sure they reach the required NRR score,2
Guess we are saving Curran for death over shenanigans :P,5
"Talking about a player's salary is just shit chat tbh. Go after their performances, they don't control how much they get paid.",6
My worst nightmare is the tHaLA DhOnI jerking off by Star Sports after he wins CSK this match,8
CSK playing for NRR right from the 9th over,5
At least rotate strike man.,4
"This CSK team has a long sqaud of bits and pieces players, don't they?",12
Seeing CSK lose is the best part of the IPL for me. Fuck CSK,19
When was the last boundary?,7
"Everything seems wrong with CSK team. Started on a wrong note with two players infected with Covid, Bhajji pulling out and then the Raina nautanki.   They look like they don't talk with each other much when they go back in the dressing room.",5
"We see a bunch of players who should not even play for their respective IPL team, but are playing the national side. 


Kedar, khaleel, Thakur",7
Laziness to get it out and run. Classic bojack (oh sorry dhoni),7
Yayyy to that cute girl in Bumrah ad,6
"Want me to watch them nudge singles and play dots till 16th over and then chase it down,no thanks",5
Even Jaddu is defending like that,3
India's number 6 and 7 at the crease for CSK...,9
"43-4 ,Dhoni and jadeja on the crease. Why does it feel so familiar ü§î?",6
I think CSK should bring Dawid Malan and let him play for Watto,5
Well I think we might not be at the bottom of the table after all,5
CSK really B A T D E E P but unfortunately they are mostly pretty shit.,12
Is it too much to ask for a bare minimum 6 run rate,1
In before CSK's 129 all out in 19.4 overs,6
[deleted],12
CSK should just declare and accept that there is no way they can win this from here.,3
Does MS Dhoni still play T20I for India? Will he be in contention for a selection or no?,5
Free stat padding game for srh,5
"jesus christ, how many quality bowlers does these guys have",5
CSK is going to close the third time today üò≠ unless they pull a Tewatia..,1
"Not gonna lie, with Dhoni still at the crease, Jadeja/Bravo/Curran to support him and seeing teams go crazy in the last 5 overs this year, I think SRH need to be very cautious here.",4
As long as MSbigD is on the crease anything can happen.,3
[deleted],-3
Wtf are these fucking forward defenses,1
CSK still got Bravo and Curran. They still can win from here,5
Grt effort Rashid,4
You can't pay me enough to dance on screen when millions are watching,10
"People making fun of CSK know this, IPL the brand ows too much to CSK and it's crazy fans for where it is today. But CSK needs new blood and new makeover if not in 2021 than surely in 2022.",-5
Can commentators talk about srh for once,4
Don‚Äôt show Delhi being stupid and attacking Rashid again.,8
"Bhakts when csk is losing: Damn we need Raina, Bravo, Harbhajan back so we can win matches and faf, rayudu should bat well

Bhakts when csk is winning: Dhoni won the match for cskkk Thala reeee",10
Khaleel just don't leak too many in your last 2 overs.,4
"Done saves NRR again.

  


Get ready for what could dhoni do when everyone around him threw away his wicket day.",2
Nico putting his livelihood in peril bringing up the world cup semifinal.,2
Shaam tak khelenge inki gaand phat jayegi,11
The RRR is ~12. 6 wickets to go against a decent bowling line-up. Looks like SRH's game to lose.,2
There's two more overs of the fifth bowler and two from khaleel. It's still not over for csk,3
[deleted],-3
hope this partnership gets their names on the Lords honour boards.,4
44/4 after 10. The hell is up CSK!,6
**RRR 12 intensifies**,2
Reminder that Kedar Jadhav scored 162 runs at a strike rate of 95 in IPL 2019.,6
What's the gameplan here?,3
"Against CSK, I'm always prepared for the worst. They've committed daylight robbery many times before to hand us narrow losses.",8
CSK is the mad scientist who repeats same script again and again and expects different results,9
"Jadhav scored 162 runs at a SR of 95.5 in 2019

How is he still in the starting 11?",4
I am so glad Dhoni FINALLY retired. I hope he retires from IPL too,5
"I mean, you can still take fucking singles lmao this is straight up garbage batting.",6
"Honest question:

Do teams need so many coaches!? i mean they have one for walking, sleeping, running, etc..etc..

i just see it as a money grab from foreign people, they just keep bringing in people they know to make money...ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2
Can't believe I decided to not do my college assignments and watch this match. Fuck you CSK.,6
CSK are going to record the lowest t20 score without being bowled out this season/,8
Scorecard legit looks like odi score,3
"All this talk of whether Dhoni can win it for CSK, forgetting he‚Äôs not even the bloke in the team who Makes Things Happen.",3
Csk becoming fc barcelona of indian cricket üòõ,1
Need this beauty from [Rashid](https://www.iplt20.com/video/142766/rashid-rides-through-msd-s-gates) now,2
I'll never understand why Dhoni hates strike rotation.,2
Dhoni is having an orgasm on the field itself by seeing his 40 SR,5
Mrs Patel needs to calm down and trust Varun,3
CSK are 44/4 after 10 overs wth,2
Fuck I'm going back to codeforces instead of watching this shit,1
"Required rate is above 12

Dhoni and Jadeja:  I'm gonna practice my front foot defence",12
SRH are 2-0 when playing with Kane. Good Guy Kane...Good Luck Kane.,3
"Come on boys, let's start playing for NRR now",9
So when did they start playing test cricket in yellow jersey,13
CSK playing to avoid the follow on,18
Csk deserves this for that Sharjah shitshow,9
We won't be able to save even the NRR this time.,8
It's been a while since I've seen Tendherer in an ad,10
If only the world's economy becomes  as good as Rashid's!!,2
CSK need a complete rebuild. Maybe Dhoni will retire after this season too.,3
"The dot balls in these timeline


> 1  |  . 1 . . . .  |  1 W . 1 . .  |  . . . 1 .",5
the wrong curve is flattening :(,4
"If you're going to waste the powerplay might as well let M.Vijay play, at least you know he'll be up to no mischief on camera.",3
Something seems off with the entire team of csk. This year's csk does not seem to play with intent or nothing they are trying seems to work for them.,3
Finally,3
Thalaaaaaaaa is back!,1
Dhoni Pichhad.,2
Yay 4,2
thank god he didn't put his hand out,2
How did mumbai manage to lose against this team,3
Intent. Need more aggressive shots.,1
Samad made a business decision,3
Telugu commentary is cringe.,10
Fucking finally,5
SunnyG just came,5
Attack start,3
I have a feeling CSK would win this match seems perfect for dhoni heroics,5
Can't deny the guy has incredible power.,5
Jeez jadhav scored only one 30+ knock in last two years,3
"Surely they‚Äôll want to remake CSK next year, but I doubt they‚Äôll change the ‚Äúcore‚Äù players like Dhoni, Raina (who they desperately need), and Jadeja, no matter how shit they might perform.",3
I mean the trend for pretty much every match so far has been to do fuck all for the first 15 overs of a chase then go ballistic in the last 5 so CSK are just following the script,5
"Army man almost decapitates J&K boy

/s",13
"Come on MSD, show us that you're still the man.",3
Samad ku samaadhi kattirpaan Dhoni. That was so close to his head.,2
Dhoni hits one boundary. Commentators start simping on que,11
Bewda - That went like a tracer bullet.,4
Thala misses test matches so much he decided to play tests in t20! üòçü§©üòçü§©,4
I'm convinced SRH players like Khalil and Natarajan and even Bhuvi and Rashid would not bowl as well if they were playing for a different franchise.,3
I thought 47/3 after 10 in the last game was bad. LOL.,8
"People who know/do betting:
These are the odds: CSK 5/1 ‚Ä¢ SRH 1/8 


This means, if you bet 1$ on CSK and CSK wins, you get 5$ --> makes sense.

But if you bet 8$ on SRH, you get 1$? So why would anyone bet on SRH?",4
"*Confirmed

Thala is the new pacman",1

"That worm lmao, literally a flat line",1
Dhoni St. YBJ b. Rashid 14(21),5
I am still scared of csk and Dhoni. :(,9
Okay so MSD hits one 4 and commentators are already creaming their pants,15
Everyone nutting,6
1 boundary from Dhoni and commentators acting like he completed his 100,40
Ffs gavaskar that was just 1 four,9
MS coming in early meaning he gets more time to settle meaning he can go berserk around the 17-18 over mark,5
Intent!!,4
Abdul Samad looks like an upgraded version of Quinton De Kock.,1
"I am getting real life salary increments ptsd looking at the csk players.

Jadhav, Karn getting payed 5+ crs while Faf getting 1.6 crs.

I know Indian middle order batsman were in demand and no one needed another ""accumulator"" type batsman who will take up the foreign slot.

But still it makes me feel sad.",23
*INTENT*,4
There is no need to treat Rashid like he's unplayable Dhoni simply does this shit for no reason,9
"CSK batting: üí©

This should be Samad‚Äôs last over. They don‚Äôt need to bowl him anymore.,3
From waiting for Dhoni‚Äôs innings to feeling cringed out.,3
Has the Quantum of loss banter started yet?,4
I didn't know Chennai played in the Ranji Trophy,7
Dhoni imitating a chair with his front-foot defence lol.,6
Sam Curran wouldn't have thought he would play for a team with more weird tactics than KXIP.,12
"ABD has fastest speed of hands, way faster than Dhoni.",4
"MSD has only one enemy this season:

NRR",11
Fucking speed on that ball. The only player with hands as fast in world cricket is standing right behind him.,4
113(50) you need one Kohli of 2016,14
yo relax one boundary is hardly a masterclass,12
Just started watching again. What have I walked into...?,9
"Almost came, more of this raw power Thala.",12
Fucking I N T E N T bitches,13
In the last 6 games against CSK we lost 5 times. We won one when MSD was unavailable.,23

Targetting Samad  is smart from CSK,4
RRR is 12 ICYMI,2

Dehnier closing towards 100 strike rate,8
C‚Äômon Thala let‚Äôs prove everyone wrong,11
That's giving everything,11
Garg again. What a save üëèüëèüëè,13
LMAO Dhoni bullying virgin spinner and taking singles against Chad Rashid!!!,15
SRH are putting everything out there!,8
Fantastic save,8
Garg is everywhere,7
"Thala number 7

Jaddu number 8

112 more needed. 7*8 = 56 which is half of 112. Hence CSK win because thala gives 200% .",15

Big MS gonna give SRH people a lot of pain today.,6

If that shot had been half a feet to the left there would have been an ambulance would have been needed.,3
If only angry rant man was a csk fan,5
I always agreed with Manjrekar on jadeja. Team takes him everywhere so that they can field him. Not a good white ball player,4
SR almost at 100 that‚Äôs what I call intent boys,7
Man Shankar's career ended before it even began,6
Since r/cricket has trolled MSD so maybe his redemption is coming,11
At least these two will be running well between the wickets.,5
The reason why Dhoni is so hated  is cus one Boundary and suddenly he's better than The Don himself,9
"Mota bhai has so much money

Can't they make a non cringe jio ad?",9
Oh I thought Warner was gonna have a trundle for a second there and now I'm disappointed,0

What's the record for most dot balls bowled in  match in an IPL ??,6
Why do these comms suck off to Dhoni so much?,13
I vividly remember an India-SL game in 2006-07 series when India needed to win 26 out of 36 balls and lost because Dhoni left it too late. That was the first incident of this NRR meme.,9
Bravo or Curran better than Jaddu,1

As long as MSD can üòÇüòÇ",7

I see Thala blaming Curran for that one over for losing this match,1
Mahendra singh jadeja,7

You just know Dhoni's going to get CSK to retain Jadeja next year.,10
"Opportunity to hog strike and play tuk tuk: _exists_

The fact that talented youngsters like Garg are not even on the fringes on prominence because of the likes of Gill and Prithvi really bodes well for the future of Indian cricket. Drowning in talent.,16
Less then  a run a ball so far for CSK,6
"Jesus, Rashid is going a run per over after 3 overs.",23
"holy fucking shit, Rashid bowled 16 balls and only gave 3 runs??",16

"Not even 5 per over after 12, jeesus",3
I think they should hold back Rashid last one for when they have to go after the bowling and they can‚Äôt afford to play him out so he‚Äôll stand more of a chance of getting wickets,4
Dhoni looking dangerous here. Might very well be *that one innings*  for Dhoni today.,5
"Bravo saying ""I'm gone for one year and this where we are at""",8
Time to start intent,4
We need wickets here. Dhoni and jadeja are good finishers you don't want them till the end.,4
[deleted],11
There's still 2 overs of Khaleel and 1 more over from someone who could be Samad or Sharma. That's 3 overs of bottom of the barrel shit that you could get 50 off if you're up for it.,4
"We've memed too many people when they were playing like this :- tewatia, pollard, Kishan,Abhishek and garag. I'm not going to criticize until the game is over",9
"Commentators were bashing Tewatia, who was genuinely trying and missing, but are simping for Jadeja, who is straight up refusing to score. 

Shit like this infuriates me and adds up to my dislike for CSK lol. No one calls out their bullshit. I wonder why.",3
Curran has a SR of 189. Why hold him back all this time. It's not like the RR is low,8
Don't worry. Looks like they will keep SRH's lead to a minimum. Dhoni will finish them off in the fourth innings.,7
Jaddu wicket incoming next over,2
"Dhoni batting against Rashid like: ""Tap and Go beta, 20 RRR ke niche Hai to no worries""",6
[deleted],3
Not able to watch match so im viewing the threads instead. How is CSK holding up so far?,1
Tomorrow‚Äôs matches should be lit. Especially the one in Sharjah.,2
Hope Warner and Bayliss make the right calls. They might go really hard at Samad or Sharma for that over by Rashid.,7
Hotstar showing M.S Dhoni movie ad while Dhoni is actually playing.,9
Perfect time for aimbot to come in,2
As much as I want to see Dhoni performing well but one has to understand when to end things and don't play for the sake of playing Dhoni did the right thing retiring in Test when he felt that was it when all of us thought he could have played more and no would have blamed unlike the situation now.,2
Khaleel gonna get tonked by dhoni & He's good against Yorker so nathrajan will also go the distance,6
"CSK need 107 off 8, quite difficult",5
"That Rashid economy, damn this is why he's so valuable",4
"Rashid Khan (lbg)	3	0	5	0	1.66

Those are great stats in a T20",3
I am not sure whether they do it but Star shouldn't show ads involving any player who is playing in the match. Would be irritating to see some guy dancing in some cringe ad while playing shit,5
Conceded more in one over than he conceded in the last two combined. Really loose over that from Rashid,3
CSK should open with PP Chawla. He literally has power play in his name. So much unrealised potential there,19
18 runs in the last 5 overs after 11 in 1 over wtf,13
This is where a team needs a Pollard or a Russell or some freak out of the blue like Tewatia. Btw current run rate is 4.8 after 12 overs,4
Thala sending in Jadeja before Curran bc he & jaddu are fwends,9
should implore jadeja to hit wicket like commentators did to tewatia,2
Warne must be fapping to this even contest between bat and ball,4
Khaleel. This could be the over.....,2
"1980s: No matter when you come out to bat, the scoreboard reads 0

2020: No matter what the target is, CSK will need 100 from 6 overs",15
I'm loving these lenskart ads,3
Bumrah has that dravid sincerity in him.  I already downloaded cardekho app and now Looking forward to invest my 160 bucks in mutual funds.,10
Tatti match hai bc. Friday night ki maa chod di,5
[deleted],11
"Calling 22 runs here

Edit : Dhoni denies it",2
Ah fuck not Khaleel chutiya üôà,1
Jaddu has finally evolved into a bits and pieces cricketer. Manjrekar is a visionary.,4
"*Warner calls Khaleel*

Swann: BIG OVER ALERT!!!!",6
I have a feeling that Dhoni's gonna swing it today,4
I‚Äôd personally rather prefer the Rashid that gets 2-3 wickets and gives 25-30 runs than this one,2
"Finish up khaleel and 5th bowl quota here and have 2 each from bhuvi, Natarajan and 1 from Rashid for last 5?",3
Strange captaincy. Abhishek should‚Äôve bowled after the Samad over to get the fifth bowler quota out of the way.,1
This kohli mrf ad is cringe af,5
'Devudu' Warner is a genius. Bowling Khalid out when there's a big urge to hit and possibly get a mishit. Save the best for later,9
One thing I can confirm to all CSK fans is that Dhoni is most definitely obviously somehow gonna be in his best fucking form against KXIP,5
Dude wtf is Jadeja doin. This is just dragging the team down.,2
CSK not interested in chasing a target for the 3rd game in a row.,7
Jadeja should never bat before Curran again,9
Dhoni gonna massacre Khaleel,4
I'm literally counting down the Khaleel deliveries. Pls don't leak.,7
It aint over yet guys,2
98 is my projected score!,5
Ohh fuck not Walmart Yash,1
CSK is dead this season. We had a good run lads. Its time up I guess,3
Warner needs to be smart and get that extra over from Sharma or Samad soon lest they leave it for the end to get massacred like Gowtham yesterday.,5
"Csk scored 58 in 12 overs and need 105+ in the last 8, and I am scared af because of Dhoni. 

Fuck man, even though now in your yesteryears, you had an impact like no other. He absolutely smashed srh in the past.",8
Commentators really want csk to win don't they?,4
Kahaleel is the only one who can get Thala out.,4
Jaddu start tonking!!,2
Warner is trying to sneak in khaleels over while dhoni is still there,6
"Girl: I love Dhoni üòç

Me: [thinking of something to impress her] I also like riding Tuk Tuks!",24
Jadeja is not a T20 player,5
"That's a good captaincy from Warner , dhoni may not target khaleel this over",9
At least try to hit the ball boys.,3
Has anyone done analysis of times Dhoni has slowed the match which has resulted in to India losing the match?,5
I wish we had a chance to witness Viru vs Rashid matchup in this lifetime,4
There is still one more Rashid over! Are they gonna play out that as well? Can they afford that?,4
Sam Curran looks so much like Charlize Theron,6
The fact that Jadeja doesn‚Äôt have an ipl fifty is bonkers.,12
"Picked bravo and Curran for dream11 today; seeing jadeja playing dot balls, me - Pakistani meme guy",3
"This is pretty pathetic, these guys are getting paid so much and most people would kill to have the opportunities they have. At least have a swing at it.",4
"Matchups i wanted to see

‚Ä¢ Rayudu vs 3D

‚Ä¢ MVijay vs KKR

SRH have let me down. CSK better bring him in when it's time",9
Not sure when Dhoni decided the chase was over.,6
Jaddu 7(14) masterclass,4
Jadeja needs to retire hurt,6
How can you be playing for NRR and still end up with a terrible NRR,12
Bits and Pieces cricketer. Sanju Manju was right all along.,11
"All the SRH fans in this thread are jixing csk

And it's working",13
What exactly do you think is it that Dhoni is doing wrong? Since 2015 his innings have been just awkward. I think it's just his age showing!,4
"Khaleel bhaiyya has changed his action, he is more Starc esque now..",5
You all criticizing MSD for not hitting the ball are forgetting that it's Gandhi Jayanti tonight. #NonViolence,15
This is not even close to the CSK we used to see. Sad.,13
CSK is just like me studying for a test don't do anything until the last minute and then just give up because it's too hard.,35
Jadeja with 2014 UV level performance,6
Csk bats retarded slow. Not just these two but everybody.,9
[deleted],4
What the heck is Haddin doing in the leadership/coaching group?,3
SRH not even tryin to get Jadeja out. Nice tactics tho,5
Never knew we had Haddin in the coaching setup.,6
"Are we still treating Jadeja as allrounder?

When was the last time he finished it for his tea, India or CSk?",5
Looks like Dhoni is satisfied with how his shots look rather than making the runs,5
Dhoni waiting patiently for RRR to reach 30+,7
Dhoni has been v bad but somehow everyone else (barring Faf) has been worse,8
"Required Rub rate is 13 , in next two overs something dramatic needs to happen",5
So they really are gonna make khaleel look like wasim akram aren't they,6
Good point by Haddin. No crowd in the stadium helps youngsters as they feel less pressure,9
Scenes if Tewatia effect kicks in.,3
Go shr go go!!,1
This is slow af,1
Akash chopra : Dhoni playing slowly is reasonable because he hasn't played cricket since 14 months.,10
Guess we have a new meme team in town,6
"CSK sucks big time, nobody can save them this IPL.",1
"Everyone trying their best to make the tournament fun and interesting, even fucking rcb

With all due respect, Csk is the worst part of this IPL",6
Cricket should always be played on big enough grounds so that the running and spinner deceiving you actually becomes a factor.,3
I thought he edged it lol,4
I'd rather have Bumble than Mark Nicholas in the booth,2
the feeling Dhoni's having rn was probably Jadeja's feeling during the WC semi final,10
"Every year Dhoni talks about unleashing ""Jadeja - the batsman"". thala bhi buddha ho gaya, jadeja bhi aur mai bhi, vo din na aaya",10
Current: 4.85 vs RR: 13.53 sends,5
If CSK win I'll change my flair to RCB forever,8
It sounded like ball hit something.,3
Taking the game deep is all well and good but if you need more than 20 off the last over it's almost practically over and the rate is already 14.5,6
Lol Sir Jadeja,3
Even Khaleel gets to improve his economy in matches like these.,8
If you can't hit Kahleel you literally have no hope,8
Is csk gonna cross 120. I don't think so,5
CSK are playing T20 where the T stands for Test. This means its a test match but u can only bat for 20 overs and 1 innings per team where u have to maintain a run rate below 5. And the two batsmens' strike rate should not be above 100 or else you'll lose the match. And CSK are just following this. This means they are winning.,11
"Brad Haddin as SRH's coach, not expected at all, wtf",8
Csk can't even put away khaleel,7
3 runs off a Khaleel over lmfaooo,4
Why the commentators still simp for dhoni I never know,6
bIg oVeR AlErT,7
Damn didn't know we had Haddin.,1
Who is csk going to target? Assuming that they will start trying to chase this score down,4
"Khaleel'S overs need to be completed before the 15th and that of the 5th bowler. Last 5 should be Rash, Nattu and Bhuvi. If we lose, we lose.",6
Imagine playing out Khaleel,5
Holy fuck csk need good batsmen badly. What if they just bench watto until the final.,7
Khaleel went for 3 lmao,6
He asked for a bat so it begins,3
Good God 3 from Khaleel over. Get that Samad over now Davey!,1
This sub is doing the same shitting on tewatia bullshit on Jadeja. You dicks will never learn,5
This is a very bad IPL season for CSK.,3
Imagine scoring 3 of khaleel over,2
Mi did it in 6 csk you have 7 overs,3
lol what‚Äôs happening...,2
Guys thats khaleel not rashid,5
"Damn, they aren't even playing khaleel lmao, hope boobie gets a 3fer today then",2
Today's match is in SRH side,2
Khaleel bowled a good over! I'm in shock,2
A bit quick don't you think ms,1
Not even appealing against Dhoni. Big brain by srh,6
This is painful to watch,3
Who was that they just interviewed?,1
Oh fuck Dhoni has ordered new bat,3
We need to rev up the reverse jinx to the max lads,1
Imagine scoring 3 runs off a Khaleel Ahmed over when the RRR is 14.,5
Dunno if I should or not but kinda feel bad seeing Dhoni like this,5
3 runs of Khaleel's over...I hate 2020,5
Can't help but get the feeling that Dhoni is getting shafted by the new management at BCCI this season. His team hasn't changed much from year to year yet the same team that usually wins so much is finally performing as they should have been all along?,2
Lol just 3 runs off Khaleel,4
Many how many times does Dhoni need to change his gloves,2
Wow a Khaleel over going only for 3 runs. #justcskthings,5
Every CSK batsman except Faf should retire after this match with immediate effect,4
why is jadeja,3
Letting Khaleel getting away with only 3 runs in the over is fuckin criminal,5
"Dhoni's biggest ability, picking the only fielder inside the circle.",5
"Thus far all the csk batsmen have struggled. Not just Dhoni. He‚Äôs come in at a time when it was needed to stabilize the wicket section on the scoreboard. 

I think this is a perfect base for msd to launch and really make this game competitive.",3
In done with this team and I can't blindly support Dhoni anymore... Fucking ridiculous,1
Can Manjrekar please insult Jadeja to get him going,7
"People will talk about Dhoni, but that was a really good over by Khaleel, wasn't just bad batting.",5
I see a Jio logo on CSK helmet. But I haven't seen CSK in the new Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan ad. REEEE.,4
CSK's struggling,2
61/4? Hopefully Stokesy and Pope can put a partnership together for Sam Curran to save the day,5
" * Watson 1(6b)
 * Rayudu 8(9b)
 * Kadhav 3(10b)
 * Jadeja 8*(16b)
 * Dhoni 15* (18b)

How do we blame Dhoni tonight guys?",10
Where is Sam Curran when you actually need him?,5
"Bat's being changed
Get ready boys",3
Was there an edge on that short ball? I heard something,5
Dhoni taking the piss on people who wanted him to come early in the order lol,4
"I used to love Dhoni

But this is just sad now",8
"We are going to end up with 124/4 in 20 overs with all this tuk tuk, aren't we?",5
This is the only way CSK can groom young players for India.,6
"From experience I can tell unless dhoni out there, our team is in trouble.",6
"Hi American here new to cricket, why is Wasim Akram bowling in IPL? I thought he retired",7
CSK going for NRR already?,3
Ok this is the deciding over,5
Every time I watch CSK they end up needing 100 from 42. How does this always happen?,7
"We are going to lose another match, don't we ?",1
I think at this point csk is just trying to keep the nrr in good shape. Not practical to win the match.,1
[deleted],3
"You gotta admit: Trevor Bayliss, Brad Haddin, VVS Laxman & M. Muralitharan.... that's a pretty beast Coaching unit

Trevor for the Ginger

VVS for the Indians

Murli for the spinners

Haddin to down beers with Warner",4
Gotta find the lucky gloves grip combination,1
This is such colossal shambles and it is only tolerated because its Dhoni.,1
"Hey at least we've won 3 titles, we were due a bad season",0
"Okay , well, I'm gonna say it... I'm gonna say it....

*Bits and pieces*",6
"People say Harsha B is different but not once have I seen him criticising Dhoni or Indians players with slight ego

These commentators are all the fucking same",2
Why is natarajan bowling now? Get that fifth bowler quota out of the way Warner!,2
"Whatever you say, CSK do make it entertaining for the last 5 overs! It's either an insane explosion or implosion!",5
"Man this is disgraceful at this point.

There's no way they're winning this game",5
"Kohli fails three matches

Commentators: WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM?

Dhoni keeps failing

Commentators: I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that",13
I want dhoni at 7 only,1
Get ready to NUT,1
How do you not hammer someone like Khaleel for at least 15 runs?,4
Lets go boys... Six on spot yorkers,5
What are they planning? Playing out khaleel and then hitting bhuvi and rashid?,3
This is a huge gamble if Nattu doesn't get a wicket in this over.,5
Yep. Not going to watch CSK matches from now on. Total waste of time with predictable result.,1
CSK is basically nothing without their minefield pitch as is being proved once again.,1
This is the year csk not gonna qualify for the play offs. I can feel it. Sad Bois.,5
Change of grips from dhoni. He is going to finally show intent I guess.,6
Let faf play all the 11 wickets from next match,2
*Mahi ~~maar~~ haar raha hain*,6
Surprised that Dhoni is calling for a new bat before the required rate reaches 36 rpo.,5
"Haha savage Viru 

https://twitter.com/virendersehwag/status/1312057705880645638?s=19",2
Should have done away with that abhishek/samad over now,2
A six or a wicket coming,1
"Just heard about CSK losing, urgently logged in",10
A friend of mine said stokes is more of a bits and pieces cricketer than jaddu,3
"Getting Khaleel's overs out of the way while the two are still in tuk-literally-not-even-trying-tuk mode, good idea.",6
Man can there please be a wicket to get csk back into the game,3
"CSK's indian reserves are shit, hence they can't afford dropping Indian players in the current XI",2
"8(16) with Sam Curran next

Hit or GTFO",4
Chennai gonna do a RCB this year?,5
"Man Dhoni shouldn't have retired from Tests, it's like his Test playing spirit is still living and craving those delicious dots and singles.",7
They will try to attack Natarajan I think?,3
"Some guy said after SRH innings, that CSK will manage to take this to 100 of 8 overs. They did even worse, 104 of 7",5
C'mon even I wanted dhoni and jadeja to smash a khaleel over,6
Can Jadeja pull off a Tewatia?,6
Can someone mic up Sanju Manju? It‚Äôs an emergency,6
"Even though he's not in good form and has not done anything in this game yet, but the mere presence of dhoni makes me feel uncomfortable idk why. We need him back in pavilion.",5
"8 off 19 is the line, beyond that is when I would be perplexed!",3
Jadeja's batting SR below 100 and averaging 71 (with an ER of 10.14) with the ball this season. Justice for Sanju Manju.,9
"I don't care how good of a position we're in, after that 2018 qualifier vs CSK I don't trust CSK to lose.",9
Times have changed pencil brands are now bowling in ipl,6
*How much more deep MS.....I can't take it anymore....aah*üòñüòñ,32
MSD swapping his dot-ball bat for single-scoring bat. Brace yourselves!,7
This is painful to watch,4
No nattu . not like this pls,3
"SRH are playing this stupid IMO. They've not finished the 4th over from their non Frontline bowler. When it comes, it's going to be a fuckin 25 30 run over.",7
Tewatia Switch mode ball numbers have been breached. And a 4 from Jadeja.,8
"If there was anyone but Dhoni there, the commentators would be full on bashing",4
A reminder to everyone that jadeja has 3 first class triple centuries. Not one but Three.,8
Need Raina back,7
"cool, now that we have a boundary, we aren't gonna see one for the next 4 overs (minimum)",8
RRR above 15 now...,6
Somebody ask Manjrekar to tweet.,7
"HotStar has a video call feature, but not a PiP mode wtf",3
"I have to say, despite all the jokes made teams not playing CSK today and CSK fans themselves, it is still very uneasy when MSD is on strike.",26
Don't jump the gun guys. He is blocking the next 3.,3
Come on boys few more overs to save this T20 Test match,6
Natrajan won't waste his yorkers on CSK.,28
Jaddu I have high fucking hopes from you,9
Jadeja to pull off a Tewatia?,11
Scenes if Warner sets up a test match fielding here,12
I N T E N T,3
"RRR:15+
Dhoni: My time has come",14
"Dhoni's taking it deep approach works occasionally if the other batsman fires, which isn't the case here unfortunately, despite this boundary now",9
MSD is fit for a old lad,16
Good that Raina left on a high (ish),12
"If RRR was traded, you just had to buy it in the first over and it would be worth double the money now",4
Dhoni still so fuckin fast between the wicket,14
"Haha, cheeky Rashid testing the calves of Dhoni!",11
"CSK's team is virtually unchanged from last year, how tf did this shit team even make it into the finals?",11
Good to see CSK struggling,1
Lmao Brett Lee,3
If Raina comes back he shouldn‚Äôt have to quarantine. Get him in the game,8
India NZ semis feels anybody,6
Nutrajan...,7
It's so fun watching CSK fans act like RCB fans lmao,62
Natarajan's action looks like behrendorf,5
I am already excited for RCB vs RR,11
Still remember the way Dhoni toyed with Steyn and bhuvi like nothing when they were in their prime.,9
Come on Nattu. Don't bottle this under pressure,3
"Abhishek, Rashid and Bhuvi have combined for 13 runs off 6 overs. That is it. That is where it was lost",8
Binga absolutely murdered him there,6
Binga is fun isnt he,6
Tbh seeing in the last few games 90+ runs are being scored in 5 overs.... Csk still has a solid chance.,8
Srh now gonna spiral out,1
Genuinely curious : do yall think dhoni played a bad knock in semi final vs new Zealand,10
"Everyone bashing dhoni but I am just super nervous that he will smash us in the final few overs. 

Rashid is the key.",9
Yorkers aren't coming off. Ominous signs. Dew definitely.,12
Wtf was that fielding tho,6
Fleming if you're reading this please open with Chawla and Thakur in the next match. I'm not memeing. It literally can't get worse,22
Natarajan has upped his pace by 5-8 ks since he last played in the IPL (KXIP). Impressive.,17
"Jadeja : Are we gonna take it Deep and hit sone useless sixes at last when it is mathematically impossible to win.
Dhoni : You're Goddamn Right",57
Natarajan's neckbeard seems to be a weird fashion choice,19
[deleted],3
"Broke - Deep fake videos.

Woke - Deep chase CSK.",14
Congrats srh!,4
Dhoni will go after natarajan.,4
Star Sports Tamil Commentary shitting on Watson and Jadhav lmao. And rightfully so.,20
Natarajan baba beard should grow the opposite side,4
"I feel really bad that I‚Äôm so uninspired by CSK that I actually want them to lose (even though I‚Äôm from Chennai), but I blame the team management. They knew this was coming and decided to ride it out instead of making changes when they should have.",13
I absolutely see SRH shitting themselves in the next couple of overs.,11
Khaleel action is somewhat similar to starc?!,2
My fellow orange army..its time to reverse jinx I believe,9
At least there was intent,3
2012 Dhoni would‚Äôve sent that into the ocean,20
CSK 71% lol,14
It would be big news if Dhoni retired mid way this IPL like Gambhir.,6
Haha 71% blind bhakts,8
Aakash Chopra is the cringiest commentator we have. Fucking pathetic.,5
Lol these delusional fanboys rigging the poll,9
Lmao Dhoni has no clue,1
Fuck jaddu,1
Can we take IPL back to India,2
Who the fuck votes on these polls?,3
Imagine thinking CSK would make it into the playoffs but not SRH.,9
"Lol 71% chance of CSK making the playoffs. 

Gives me WinViz vibes!",9
Just need 20 an over. Ez pz.,3
71%?????,10
so more csk fans bother to log on to iplt20,7
"When Jadhav got out, RRR was 10.5, now it is 15.5 without losing another wicket. What excuses can Dhoni give today?",12
CSK are never going to lose an online poll lmao. There is an online Thala army waiting to pounce always.,24
Bhuvi gonna run through these 2 easily,4
LOL 71% are these voters blind??? or just delusional,24
"Jadeja striking the ball sweetly, its just not going in the gap.",3
Why do Hindi commentators keep kissing ass of dhoni non-stop? There's been zero critical view of him.,26
Dhoni has started swinging. Bringing the 5th bowler now would mean carnage,3
"Get Bhuvi with 2 slips, a gully and a leg slip for maximum flex",7
Oh CSK. What have you become!,8
"Against an all Indian bowling lineup, won't be surprised if Thala wins this for CSK. And his fans go mad",6
This poll just confirms how every poll is just fan based and no one is thinking realistically,9
Oh fuck off you just took a advert break,6
How many times has a team won an IPL game by chasing 94 runs in the last 6 overs?,3
I just realised tomorrow is a holiday where I live so I need to go shopping pronto.,5
"Haha what a joke, 73% voted that csk has better chances than srh to make it to playoffs. Csk batting is all crap this time. Retired players lost touch with cricket.",11
"CSK 71%

Man, this is partly because of the idiotic Hyderabadis that root for CSK (and other teams) due to 1 player",8
No point of batting deep if we play safe like this,3
"Jadeja hits a gap for a double.
Commentators - Wow, how is Dhoni pumping those legs.",11
Csk are the new rcb now,18
"This team is finished. Finished. Gotta rebuild the team next mega auction. Somehow we beat MI. Rest of the matches, there has been a daylight between the quality of the sides.
 It has been a great journey, but all good things come to an end. This IPL is the end of the road for this team.",12
Yes true couples in their 50s have such romantic conversations,8
I love Rohit's dramatic faces in the Dream 11 ad kek.,5
Hate this strategic timeout shit.,5
"Nobody:


Natarajan: Yorkers!!! That's all you had to say, fam!!",3
"Strategic timeout has come at the right time for Aakash Chopra, who can now start thinking about his article.",4
It's 71% cus SRH fans are trying to reverse jinx ‚Ñ¢,19
Hindi commentators give a bj to dhoni already,10
[Atleast CSK‚Äôs twitter game is on point](https://i.imgur.com/qFClT5a.jpg),22
Never thought I would see Dhoni struggle,3
Mega auction only thing saving CSK,8
CSK is done for today,8
CSK going for experience and not investing in talent absolutely backfired.,5
Dhoni and Jaddu have to be aware that they are losing the game. What's stopping them from going full afridi?,5
"Dhoni will retire from IPL after 2020. Dhoni's stonk will go down for 2021 and it will be embarrassing to see him go for less money in 2021 mega auction, so he'll better hang the boots...",5
Anyone else think a few of batsmen and bowlers maybe juicing on account of the muscle they've put on these days?,2
It's surprising that Dhoni never mentored anyone to be his deputy to take over at CSK.,8
CSK fanbois ensuring that they atleast win the polls,16
Why is that sunfeast bounce ad coming after every fucking over?,3
"Ffs my heart can't take another jadeja-dhoni ""almost"" win",9
Name one player other than Ashwin which Dhoni groomed and he became successful for India. He just inherited Dravid's good team and took it to another level. Jadeja's best IPL season was under Warne so Dhoni doesn't get credit.,6
kanos & warney do warm the heart,7
I fucking hate it when they start the strategic timeout after the commercial break is over.,15
Guys can we start posting quantum of loss memes yet?,8
This is painful to watch. Btw it is easier to fix this way than fix scoring 30 runs an over.,13
I always wondered about the choice of bowlers in these situations. I'd rather leave the 5th bowler till the very end and try to close the game out with the best death bowlers right now.,2
"CSK should buy a big hitter next year that can make quick work of a total like this, someone like a Curran, is he available?",8
If mega auction is cancelled then I'm taking a 1 year break from ipl,9
CSK will do a 2016 RPSG this year.,6
Mumbai look the favourites this tournament tbh,5
"Strategic time out is for contemplating the game situation. It's not for going to the fridge and bringing back loads of stuff to eat. Only learned that today, must now try and lose a few pounds.",8
Lmao did i just see Hitler in an ad on HotStar?,5
Damn CSK's really struggling,5
"Playing for the NRR, BUT YOU NEED POINTS ON THE TABLE TO USE NRR",6
"At this point, CSK should just say, ""fuck this season"" and rebuild for the next season. All the dead weights starting from Dhoni, Watto, Vijay, Jadhav should be gone. Make Faf as the captain and Dhoni as an advisor to the team and rebuild.",6
"RCBs this season:

RCB, RCB Punjab Branch, CSK",9
"Watson out and Santner in.

Kedar out and gaekwad in.

Maybe chawla for sai Kishore.

Christ, there's literally nobody else in that squad.",8
This is going to be a huge over.,4
This over gonna be huge,2
Something's gonna happen this over,4
So Dhoni is now taking the match to last over to hit 6 sixes and show us he is better than tewatia,5
Oh god oh fuck here comes the 5th bowler,4
The problem with Dhoni‚Äôs approach is he has basically killed the match for the next batsman if he gets out now.,4
Right 6 balls of samad,2
"Meanwhile me not turning the TV off, already have missed many close games and super over.

Back of my mind says again in last 5 overs 6s will fly high",2
Need to invest in better Indian players,3
Big over vibes. This will set the match,5
This over gonna be big,3
Am sorry to say but if CSK has to have any chance then Jaddu has to go. DJ and Sam are better bet for this Rqd. rate.,3
Where are the last hope guys?,3
MI pulled of similar stuff the other day against RCB on this very ground. So I‚Äôm genuinely not gonna think we have the edge until the last ball.,2
Tis the over lads,1
**IT'S A FUCKIN DOUBLE HEADER TOMORROW.**,9
20+ over or a wicket incoming?,5
This over's either going to be big or one of these two are going to be dismissed. No way they would try to see him off.,1
"Taking it deep, eh Mahendra.",1
Nope this over is gonna be singles,1
bits and pieces,3
Only tewatia can save csk now,6
"I see, Abdul samad promoted ahead of Abhinav sharma",2
Oh boi Samad is either getting smacked or getting a wicket,3
Smith vs Kohli will be exciting.,7
Jadeja gonna cry,2
"Seriously don't understand this ""Strategy of taking it  deep"" it's easier to take it deep when you have a lower score lmao, and most team will catch up on this strat",4
something is gonna happen this over it‚Äôs been too long,5
"Still posible tbh, CSK do have a good chance",4
"Du plessis is the only player to have strike rate greater than 100 (115)

This is a sad display.",8
Samad not Abhishek?,2
CSK were 36 in 6 why is it so hard to score at at least six an over??,3
Worried about sneaking in overs.,2
Is it only me or does Samad look like Nitish Rana,3
This looks a dick move,4
4 more sixes to go Jaddu!!,4
"My prediction: CSK will totally shit the bed this season. I'm talking RCB-2019 and DD-2017 level shitting. Dhoni will be forced to retire and take on a coach/mentor role at CSK for future seasons. 

Bring on the hate and the downvotes. I don't care. I've had enough of Dhoni BS and fans/comms simply refusing to admit that he's way past his useful playing years. I loved him... Nay...I worshipped  him until about 2015'ish timeframe. He should have hung up his bat right after that world cup. Since then, he's been a net negative for India team. And now, that's coming true for CSK team too.",28
Finally a clean strike,2
"I swear to God if these two just nurdle their way around till the end of the match and we don't get to see Scurran come out and bop a few, I'm gonna be livid",8
"CSK's NRR startegy in the end be like, highest NRR but no points lol",5
Bad captaincy to bowl the last over with Nattu instead of Samad.,1
Wait for b00m from MAHI,1
"Reminder

Even if CSK gets 30 from this over, they'll need 12 RRR for the rest of the overs",9
Will this be another last 5 overs chasing time bashing,3
5 sixes this over,5
"MI have continuously kept their core updated so they'll remain successful.

DC have finally developed a core which should give returns for years. 


CSK, on the other hand, what made them so successful till now, looks like it will lead to their downfall, all aging players with a handful of young players who don't yet 'belong' to CSK.",9
Dhoni and Jadeja talking about batting practice in an already lost match.,1
* Semifinal PTSD intensifies further * üò≠,8
Imagine losing to a team that lost to RCB,12
[deleted],1
[removed],9
Dhoni probably asking jaddu to cool it,5
Finally man,2
Warner should have been done with this over long ago.... I am scared this will give Dhoni or csk the momentum they needed,1
Samad??? SRH deserve a thrashing.,3
It's unfair to ask from CSK to chase this. Batting in 2nd inn except for sharjah has been atleast 150% tougher than 1st inn. The only team that has batted well in 2nd inn is MI this season.,1
"You know if Bravo and Curran came up instead of Jadeja and Jhadav they would have atleast tried to hit. I don't know why Dhoni, Jhadav, and Jadeja think its ok to not to try every game. Why is it just those 3 Indian players. Because they don't have to worry about their spot?",27
Riskyyyyy decision imo,2
Ok 84m six hardly clears the boundary! This ground's huge,6
Thala probably miffed at Jaddu for not taking it deeeep,2
Swann needs to clear his throat before talking. So fucking hard on ears.,5
Dhoni is seriously out of form!!,8
"Dhoni: _taps the ball straight to a fielder_

Commentators: üò©üí¶üí¶dhoni",62
Okayy this is painful to watch,5
"""Bowling leg spinner to left hander is a bad idea""",11
"DHONI PULLING THE BAT LIKE THAT IS SOO FUNNY

xDD",1
Abdul Samad's action is quite pleasing,6
Oohh Dhoni got angry there,5
I N T E N T from Dhoni there,7
"Nothing : 
Dhoni: Time to fix my gloves.",12
He is out of touch man can't blame him..,4
Tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk,9
Dhoni should bat with lenscart lens,6
This is bad. Very bad,3
"Man I sure am glad Dhoni is retired from Indian duty, now I have the luxury of just watching his bullshit from a distance and laughing.",9
Lol 8 from that over,6
Fuck,3
"Fucking painful, absolutely painful to see Dhoni like this",13
Lmao the part timer almost got THALA out,7
6 of 4 balls.. big over my foot,9
That went a lot better than I envisioned it would. Good one Samad!,5
Might well call him tuk tuk Dhoni,3
Emotion from Dhoni üò≥,9
Dhoni is looking so foolish with horrible timing,3
Smart captaincy by Warner here. Dhoni pounds on left arm spinners usually so bowling Abhishek would've been risky tonight.,7
Ugh no timing....,3
"Dhoni edging every ball onto his pads.

Shabaashüëèüëèüëè",7
Okay Nicholas? That was an excellent over,3
Lmao 86 off 5 overs,4
"RRR:15.5 

Dhoni: Hmmm not good enough, let it go to 30+, will bring out Intent^TM then",10
"Dhoni is so out of form, that even his edges aren't reaching the fielders",7
"""BE THE INFINITE""

""you can't even finite bruh""",3
3D play from srh not catching it on purpose,3
Got away with the fifth bowler. Time for Khaleel to show up for CSK,5
LOL if samad got Thala...,6
Takes a single to keep the strike.,1
Dehnier is tewatia-ising,3
Kashmiri boy vs man in the army.,2
"Dhoni edging every ball onto his pads.

Shabaashüëèüëèüëè",5
Dhoni almost got out,2
[deleted],3
Theory: The fielder put down the catch intentionally,6
Sneaked in a decent over.,5
Is there any team other than CSK that consistently loses a chase by 50+ runs with about 5 wickets in hand,5
"how is there 5 overs left chasing a lot, and have a strike rate below 100 dhoni, come on mate",1
Did they change the rules where you can't advance down the track while batting?,5
Dude this Samad is bowling well to MS or MS hasn't been able to connect,2
Hurts to see Dhoni struggling. Please retire legend .,3
Samad has bowled an insanely good over here. Expected atleast 2 more sixes after the first one.,7
You need another Polly and kishan,3
Intentional drop /s,2
"Ok, it's possible that we might be in with a chance to win this now",7
Dhoni still thinks he can first botch up the chase and get anything because there is dew lol.,2
Dhoni's face lol,3
lol nicholas had to backtrack after criticising dhoni,4
CSK has to be the luckiest team,1
Another bIg oVeR AlErT wasted,6
Sad to see Thala struggling like this,7
"I was jerking off to highlights of Rohit Sharma's last innings. 

Suddenly someone knocks on my door. I quickly switch windows to highlights of Zak Crawley daddy hundred this summer before opening the door.

Lo and behold, it's Pat Cummins standing in his full glory in front of me. 

I smile. He smiles back. Maybe he heard me moaning. Oh fuck, he spotted my erect cock which got even harder looking at Cummins' gorgeous smile. 

He says, pointing towards my boner: ""Aap Dream11 pe team banao, ye kaam main kar leta hu"" ending it with a smirk.

Save Khaleel for the 20th please.,3
Bhuvi's got 2 and Rashid's got 1. We got this boyz,6
Why am I hurting myself like this?,6
I think every commentator would spontaneously combust if Samad got Dhoni,5
[deleted],2
How can we be in the same position every single freaking game,9
Tactical avoidance of the catch,7
"In 2016, SRH had Bhuvi, Fizz, Kaul, Sran, Nehra üòç

All in top form. Nehra got injured midway i believe. 

imo, that was the strongest Bowling attack SRH ever had.

IIRC Bhuvi, Fizz were top 2 wicket takers",11
Nice..now Dhoni HAS to go after Rashid,5
"Mark Nicholas just said ""This isnt a criticism, just an observation"" when talking shit about Dhoni lmao

Fucking Simps in the commentary",13
This was the over for CSK,3
When was the last time Dhoni took it deep and won the game?,10
"Runrate is 17.2 wit 1 rashid over.
Fuccc",3
"With bhuvi's 2 over and rashid's 1 hr left, it's not going to easy for csk",4
That drop was the match for csk,3
"CSK fans - Dhoni will target the 5th bowler
Dhoni - Sorry dudes",8
Dhoni always frustrates the batting partner into losing their wicket. Been seeing this for years now,7
I am all in for srh going with only 4 bowlers..,2
[deleted],25
What is the purpose of *KAMLA PASAND* ad?.,4
These 2 are playing utter crap that even some of their own fans will want a wicket badly here.,6
"Repeat after me

Tuk

Tuk",7
Cricbuzz dude still optimistic about csks chances.,10
I am getting pissed everytime they show this oppo ad right after Dhoni plays cos his performance in the ad completely juxtaposes his shenanigans on the field. Smh,7
Rashid deserves a wicket or two. No one's been able to play him,3
CSK should retain Faf for 15Cr to make up for under paying him for 3 years,25
Now they're showing intent but struggling to hit a single shot,10
"If I could Time Travel I would go back in 2007 Ind Vs any team match Reddit thread and comment "" Dhoni can't play Spin""",3
I can't decide if CSK is extremely shit or if Warner has been on point with his bowling changes.,3
why am i still so nervous ._.,7
Not a single ball out of middle!!,6
Hope Rashid can close it cleanly.,3
Bowl Warner.,2
"""One big over changes the scope""

This is SRH we're talking about, there's no way they're gonna give a 15+ over here",8
"They haven‚Äôt even made half the runs. And both batsmen know it and still can‚Äôt hit it. That‚Äôs when you know they need to be dropped in the mega auction (yes, even Dhoni even if it results in a massive loss of fans and identity. They could make him mentor or ambassador etc. if they wanna keep the connection for the fans)",2
I don't care that CSK are old hapless hags. What makes me mad is that they're ruining my late evening cricket evening by being so unwatchable.,7
It is sad to see Dhoni go out the same way he decried the former generation of greats for going. I dont know but I thought he would have called time before letting us see him like this,16
CSK still have Curran & Bravo in the dugout ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,10
bowl kaney,3
Happy Non-Violence day bois!,8
Dhoni should retire legend,4
They aren't gonna go beyond 120,4
Missing leg.,1
close finish on the cards imo,2
Csk method works when only dhoni plays like dhoni not when everyone plays like dhoni,6
Rashid has some zip off the track or some shit. What a ball!,2
Dhoni's timing is gone,4
Come on for godsake. Even rcb would have played better. They would have been all out by now,4
Is this the lowest first 15 overs total this IPL?,8
"Wat is this? Why torture the audience, RCB is better atleast they get out",14
why sharma only bowled 1 over ?,1
can r/cricket bully thala into full retirement?,5
Pitching outside leg.,1
"K, this is really just painful. The commentators can't let go of the past, and Dhoni looks like a shadow of himself. He can't even make clean contact with the ball.",8
Warner thought bout the review cause he doesn't want the wicket,4
Dhoni is officially a park uncle who insists on batting,11
Oh Dhoni! Please retire and come back as a coach. This phase is marring everything you did for the country and IPL.,8
What a waste of a review,1
"Siva: Jadeja has to go big now, no other choice

Bc, then what will Dhoni do. Hit the winning four ?!!",2
[deleted],1
"Blow it up CSK. Release M.Vijay, Watson, Jadhav, Jadeja. Dhoni as well. He is past it.",5
That seemed not out in real time at least.,3
This is what we all wanted from SRH! Absolutely tightening the noose around the opposition,1
can we pls borrow rahul tewatia??,2
"Cannot.connect.bat.to.ball, MS. How could he be so unaware of his own inability?",2
Dhoni is such a sweet mistimer of the ball.,9
Please let this be out,4
"Jadeja: you should accelerate, hit some six or something


Thala: http://imgur.com/gallery/1hhzdmb",1
"Using a review for the sake of it, are we?",5
Fucking waste of time,5
"Ugh, that looked like it pitched outside leg from India",4
"I mean obviously csk are clueless, but this is quality bowling from srh too",3
Dhoni fans still be jacking off to the one boundary he hit,2
Going down the legside anyway. Waste of a review,2
"Dhoni has changed his bat or gloves 3 times for the 23 balls he's faced so far

And made 18 runs",9
Can we get a Kanos over just for fun. We all know csk ain't gonna chase this anyway,6
Why don't they start with the ultra edge itself?,3
"Outside leg. f. Else, looked out",2
Reminder that Curran and Bravo are yet to bat while Dhoni and Jadeja keep taking singles and throw the match.,1
"Quick! Dhoni's shitting himself with the bat yet again, better show a slow-mo montage over dramatic music of him looking really clever and serious to get everyone on his side again",13
pretty lame T technique,4
"flash backs of 2019 world cup with jadeja and dhoni batting.  
In the end dhoni will be 50 \* but game lost.  
Today no excuse for him as he came at 7th over.",6
Srini mama is no Sanjiv Goenka,3
Wasted review,4
Ffs just hit wicket and end the match,2
Tbh better for them to keep curran off the crease,5
Does none of the CSK batsmen practice range hitting at all?,5
Are CSK players playing in the same city as SRH? Dhoni looks like he has just come out of a sauna while the SRH Bois are all looking cool and relaxed.,5
Rashid is so confidently wrong every time,5
lol warner doesn't even want to get jadeja out.,5
Well done Nattu,4
I FUCKING LOVE MY TEAMMMMMMMMM,5
Why would they review??,3
"Based of off his performance so far, once Hardik gets his bowling back, Jadeja is out of the t20i team",3
timepass review ‚Ñ¢,3
"It's really weird seeing csk performing like this, i don't remember them losing 3 matches in a row this early in the tournament",2
Why won't you get out Jaddu,1
"Fine, it's pitching outside leg, but I want to see the eventual outcome of the ball üòÇ",3
Rumours say that Srinivasan has already booked a hotel room with Big balcony for 2021 season,13
review for what...,2
It was never meant to be him coming and banging the bowlers. Everyone should remember he's a shell of his former own. More like a tribute season for the oldies at CSK,3
SRH fielding has improved in last 2 games. Kudos to Haddin,3
shite ball,1
Good couple of stops there by SRH,1
The worst thing about this is that it is bringing world cup semifinal memories back.,3
what is the point on front vision when they are going to go for ultra edge anyway?,3
Only six runs so far from Rashid spell. Awesome,2
Srh- oh no!...anyways...,3
"Holy fuck, I'm legit proud of the boissss",6
Why don't they start with ultraedge itself. Why waste time.,6
Why bowl short man?!,2
"Who looks more shit this season, Kohli or dhoni?",7
Wow. No big fielding mistakes this innings so far.,6
"The truth is  that Dhoni is following Gandhis principle of  No hitting due to Gandhi Jayanti, otherwise he would already have won CSK the match",29
Finally connected one!!,5
Can Dhoni pull a tewatia,9
Dew is showing its full effect.,1
This was actually v easy to hit,0
Asinine comments asking a player to hit wicket.,3
"Okay Dhoni fans, time to come up with your excuses",9
Hopefully these guys stay till batting power play,1
"why does outside leg just eliminate the need to keep looking in ball tracking? serious question haha, i always wondered about that",5
If only they gave Raina the balcony..,12
Just two four from dhoni,2
"I feel like it's going to get lost in all the CSK and Dhoni stories, but SRH have fielded magnificently.",12
A front foot forward defense hahahahaaha,9
Imagine if broadcast operator already knows its pitching outside while umpire keeps asking fro rock n roll. He should be like BSDK it's not out,9
Imagine if umpire really fucks up later and we don't have a review cause we really wanted to see the cool animation,8
"19RPO

Front foot defence",18
Just get MSD out...Idc what arm chair critics on /r/cricket say...he scares me,15
"We r witnessing the fall of an empire here. Dhoni will retire after this season, CSK will let his colonels go and start fresh.",9
I am stressed.,3
Yes defensive shot is what we need at this point,3
Has any team ever made playoffs after from this position?,2
Classic dhoni,1
[deleted],0
Time for umpires to start simping cause of that four,2
At least take a single Thala :(,5
Did he just defend the ball?,4
Did Dhoni take part in some counter terrorism operations during his time off? Dude looks like he has PTSD.,10
This is an ideal example of how one should not approch a chase in t20s,5
"What is Rashid doing, the previous ball was supposed to be a boundary but Natarajan saved it and he bowled so short & so fast again",2
SRH never fails to unearth new bowling talents in IPL.,5
What the FUCK !!!!!!,2
Excellent spell from rashid,1
"Ode to Dhoni:

Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.",12
Why do they keep showing the goddam fantasy thing every over,2
Another insane spell from Rashid,8
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU PURPOSELY DEFENDING THE BALL FFS?,7
"And they wanted him to play the T20 world cup, guy ran out of gas in 2013",10
The fact that they haven't even reached 100.,9
Rashid bowling a couple pies last over to dhoni,2
It's all fun and games for you guys until Chennai go on and beat us on Sunday,11
Thala after hitting a four :- mai toh thak gayi bhaishab,21
"Casually defends it for another dot, noice",6
WHy would he play defense?,5
Rashid = GOAT confirmed,3
Till when are the dugout guys going to keep praising dhoni?,4
Bhenchod 12 runs in 4 overs,5
Sam Curran deserves a better captain than Dhoni,3
"Yes, puts one to boundary then defends the next couple of balls",3
78 of 24 is easy. MI scored 79 vs RCB,4
Dhoni is a fucking fraud,5
Are they playing curran and bravo as pure bowlers??,2
Atleast give Bravo a chance boys,1
how deeeeepppppp is deeeeeeeeppppppp enough..!!,3
"Even if CSK win this, it has been such a terrible approach to a T20 game",5
Dhoni reminds himself he is Dhoni and decides to play out Rashid.,5
Dhoni should hit a six just for the highlight reel atleast,6
Who are they playing music for?,4
"Dhoni tarnishing his image much worse than Yuvi, he should retire just like Gambhir did",9
Come on Bhuvi vs Msd,2
Eventually they'll take it so deep they'll take 2 overs in credit from their next match,9
When partnership is of 45 balls even then both batsman are not able to hit at all,4
Yikes. Hotstar playing Dhoni retirement ad,6
Rashid khan 3-0-5-0 is this test match or what?,5
This run chase is slow asf,2
People here are shitting on dhoni but you also have to remember the top 4 all got out cheaply,-4
That economy of 3 GOAT STUFF,9
Absolutely criminal Curran and Bravo aren't out there right now,9
"Akash Chopra: If he plays towards mid off, he can clear the gap.

Dhoni: *tuk*.    *another tuk*

Chopra: Ohhh",12
LOL this is fucking biblical mate,2
Decent ODI knock from both of them,8
Would be crazy if Dhoni pulls this off. Some unfathomable targeting of selected bowlers,5
Conspicuous timing of dhoni retirement ad,6
"Comrades, are we nearing the Quantum zone?",3
"I‚Äôm confused by what CSKs plan is here?

They‚Äôre not exactly batting like they need 78 off 4 overs..",3
Why the fuck am I so nerves even now??,6
Whistle podu...,6
"RRR:19+

Dhoni: Hmmmm I wonder what happens when I defend, oh RRR goes *up*, hmm interesting.",11
I think csk will lose,2
"Both Jadeja-Dhoni compliment each other. üòç

Just like Trump-Melania....",4
Without taking a single wicket Rashid have choked CSK... Thats what a quality bowler does,2
Dhoni was beast before 2015 playing against spin. I close my eyes and I can imagine long hair Dhoni coming down the pitch to smash Afridi all over üòû,3
Rashid gave up and 8 runs that over and still finished with 4-0-12-0. Insane.,3
I'm thinking trying to get a single to get yourself on strike might not be the most sensible thing to do when you need 3.5 a ball and your strike rate is under 100,7
Honestly CSK should just quit from ipl to save us all this time,4
Time to boost NRR!,7
"With the age of the team and the washed out nature of the players I expected this performance in 2018.

But somehow Watson and Rayudu were in peak form and dragged the team to a comfortable victory.


In 2019, batting was weak but somehow Dhoni played some decent knocks they came to the finals. I was totally perplexed, how is the possible.


But now in 2020, all the doomsday predictions of the aging team came true within 4 matches.",7
Why did they not target the 5th bowler samad when the rrr is going past 15?,1
Sorry CSK guys but I guess its time you really need to fill your squad with young talent and encourage them.,2
"How Dhoni conned so many into thinking he was ever a decent t20 bstsman, is beyond me",1
Dhoni is a hypocritical idiot.,-1
This is unfathomable chase. Gotta see what dhoni says in match presentation.,2
Yorkers Boobie. Come on..,2
Dhoni Fan Boys - How you defending today ?,4
"> RRR: 18.72

It's not impossible, I am holding on to hope. My body is ready!",8
It would tear anyone to take this deep,2
Test match not being played in whites. Huh intresting..,6
Commentator still hyping up CSK to chase this like MI lmao,5
Nattu to bowl 20?,2
This is actually painful to watch,2
"Just, like, retire dude",5
"Dhoni or Jadeja should've gotten out 2 overs ago, with Curran and Bravo maybe they'd have a chance",2
"Did Styris just say ""Can't leave Kohli out, he's a jew""? Lul",6
Dhoni would have been a better #5 than rahane in Indian test team. Thala just loves getting his huge pads and softly crass the delivery in front of him,1
"What's the excuse to support MSD even now ,

Here is mine 
- Dhoni isn't hitiing because he is endorsing the non violence ideology on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti",19
I feel so happy right now that I'm not a CSK fan... must be so frustrating for them watching your Captain defend balls when the RR is nearly 20,3
"Dhoni wants a new bat, bat wants old Dhoni",11
Quick. Tell me the song playing,1
"Keep this below 20, SRH got this game",2
One more Khaleel over boys. Game's not done,0
CSK honestly just looks tired. Watch Dhoni drink the blood of a virgin after this and bounce back to score a 40 ball century against us on Sunday.,5
Fuck off this is exactly the kind of shit that happens when CSK plays,7
[deleted],5
Excellent straight drive,6
Rashid has been the best T20 spinner for how many years now?,3
"As long you don‚Äôt do stupid stuff like no balls, drop catches, etc,  I am happy with a team.",1
Match is decided in this over.,1
This. Is. Painful. to. Watch.,2
"I believe Rashid bowled 21 innings giving less than 20 runs since he joined IPL.

Since that same time, the next two Narine and (Jadeja?) do not come close even when you add their tallies, which is 15-16",3
Unfortunate Bhuvi!,3
There's that intent again,2
No Bhuvi.....,3
Lmao all that insane hitting by Pollard and Kishan got Mumbai 79 off 24. CSK needs 78.,2
2 for 2. hmm.,2
"Lol commentator saying ""are we gonna see dhoni magic""",9
Fucking length again!,4
This is difficult to chase even if rcb was bowling with umesh and siraj,11
*scriptwriter laughing rn*,6
wtf is this chase?? They aren't even chasing a 200 target..,3
Predicting Dhoni fifty today and will stay not out. That should satisfy Thala fan bois,6
Csk gonna shit their way to a win,4
Boobie don't break me.,3
That was the straightest shot I have ever seen. Not down the ground,2
Fasten your seat belt folks,5
Sunny saying 'the assault has begun' lol,12
"Sub: Chuckles, I am in danger.",12
Bhuvi bowling absolute pies. Had the same problem in the death last game too,7
"I seriously think CSK still have a decent chance, Bravo and Curran to come, whilst Kaleel still has an over left",5
Somebody remind CSK that NRR only works if they have enough wins 1st.,6
Dhoni started talking to Jaddu. Single next ball confirmed,3
"SunnyG ""assault has begun""

Galti se laga tha wo 4",5
"**YORKERS MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU BOWL THEM?**",7
These 2 discuss like something big is going to happen.,6
"Gavaskar, unironically - *The assault has begun*

Have some shame, Sunny Paaji",6
It's happening guys üò≠üò≠,5
CSK need to do a KKR with Dhoni and start fresh next year,1
ffs...stop that unnecessary hype!!,3
Only Pollard/ Pandya/ Russell / Rahul might be able to win this from here,2
Commentators already jerking off with just 2 4s.,4
Yikes. 444.,3
[you feel me?](https://twitter.com/Alpha_Taurus_/status/1307037547068043266?s=19),2
wtf,3
Classic Dhoni innings,1
Bhuvi bc,3
Man this is bad....,3
What is this crap!,5
Lmao bhuvi memeing now,2
BC bowl off side slower ball to Jadeja.,2
I think there is a window open leading to a wormhole through which csk can achieve tewatia velocity,4
*Scriptwriter.exe has started working*,9
Get it in the hole - KP,6
SRH being SRH.,2
BHUVI COME AROUND THE WICKET IDIOT,3
If they fucking win from here...,6
Fucking hell Bhuvi!,5
Jadduuu,3
Apparently Jadeja senses my previous comment and has agreed they need to get shifting.,2
"Ah shit

Guys i'm gonna say the S word

....SUPEROVER",4
Ummm,2
CSK is still in the game. They have couple more hitters after this.,5
Sunny surely didn't get tbe here we go again meme,3
Fuckin don't jinx it you comms,3
"Tewatia with 5 sixes, Jaddu with 5 fours!!",4
"KP: ""Get it in the whole""",7
How the hell he's getting fours,6
It's happening!! Oh my God it's happening! Everybody stay caaaaaaaaalm!,7
"We need 5 fours an over, even this we are behind",7
fuck,6
Get it in the hole!,2
What in the fuck are these balls Bhuvi is bowling,3
what a let down from bhuvi.,3
Bhuvi having brainfade,4
I get the first one but next two are bad,2
This is the kind of shit which makes you feel IPL is fixed.,-6
"After hitting 3 fours this over, CSK's current run rate came up to 6 in 16th over. That should explain the sad state of CSK",3
THAT WAS A WIDE JADEJA,5
5d chess from Dhoni to see out Khaleel and target Bhuvi,4
That's excellent running,1
Why do you have to give me hope CSK? Just lose if you're gonna lose.,7
Now it's getting interesting,0
"CSK hits a boundary 

Commentators : extreme jizzing",12
What...,0
"When tewatia happened, it was same score. Need that kind of innings now from both the batsmen.",5
"Jadeja doing a dhoni on dhoni here- plays slow and puts pressure on him, and now scores a few boundaries to get his strike rate to 120+...",2
"Ah shit, here we go again",3
100 up bois,2
No Bhuvi. 3 years ago Bhuvi was almost unplayable at the death. He bowler yorkers for fun. Not the same anymore.,6
Dhoni playing out Rashid like he is scoring 20 per over against other bowlers. What did they expect when playing dots in middle overs.,11
Not like this..not like this..,7
I don't understand the point of accelerating now when the game is out of reach. Why couldn't they even try to hit one boundary an over before? It wasn't a hard chase.,7
RIP SRH. Next 3 overs gonna hurt,6
Very bad 2nd and 3rd ball.,9
"Oh, 0.75 Tewatiae",11
Bairstow's keeping is üëé,5
The fcccck is wrong with Bhuvi. Why is he bowling every bowl at the leg.,6
Sir Jadduu,3
Margin of defeat^TM,3
"Jadeja trying to get runs and Dhoni not being aggressive, reminds me of something",14
Again. These 2 will take close to 20 runs and lose. They r perpetually stuck in time at that semi final,15
Boobie nooooo,2
Sunny & LSK. I need these two guys to get Thanos snapped of the commentary world.,3
52 off the last 3 will be a nice watch.,5
is this the... acceleration?,3
Dude that's a catch??????,8
"The assault has begun. What? it is only 2 fours.

Watch other teams",2
I think Samad might be a better option than Khaleel here,1
I don't think Ranjitsingh had the straight boundary behind the keeper in mind while playing leg glance Sunny,3
For the first time in my life I find myself cheering for CSK.,0
Why tf did no one appeal?,4
Wait what was that sound ?,2
Is there still life in the match?,1
It was Out.,4
That‚Äôs all you had to bowl all over.,1
üíØ what an achievement,3
"lol,, no appeal",6
Was that an edge,3
I will eat 3 cans of asparagus if CSK wins this now. /r/mma represent,9
Current rr still less nrr,2
Was that a nick?,4
Somebody take a wicket noooooowwww,2
That's an edge what the fuck,8
I definitely heard something,6
Wtf?,4
Dhoni cost India the 2019 WC,13
Is Bairstow deaf,12
There was an edge?,6
APPEAL,2
get it in the hole...,2
SRH don't want him to get out.,3
They don't want to get Jaddu out cause next is Sam,3
[deleted],1
You have to swing it jaddu. This ain't gonna help,3
Khaleel...,2
Get Bairstow a hearing aid,11
Natrajan is going to win it for SRH.. if he bowls like anything he did in last match..,5
Shocking over and the asking rate still went up,9
RPO finally touches 6!!!,4
Jaddu farming strike,6
Did khaleel pull his hamstring there?,4
Hope that edge doesn't cost the match,4
Still behind the rrr required,2
Is that out??,3
Dhoni is past it is an understatement. Dhoni is so past it that he can't do it even when dew is around lol.,10
Why wasn't there an appeal?,7
"Khaleel using his thicc butt to save the ball, what a lad!",8
Massive edge there,6
So much crowd noise Bairstow didn't hear the edge,13
Lmao that was edged. So was the that bouncer from Khaleel to Dhoni,10
Fielding side couldn‚Äôt hear that due to the silence in the stadium,13
The players and umpires blaming the crowds for not hearing nicks holds no ground now. Who do they blame now?,11
"this is 
 
unexpected",1
no appeal what the hell,2
Why was there no appeal??,1
Lmao definitely edge there . srh memeing again,2
"Meanwhile Dhoni supporters still thinking this is all his plan ,and he will take them to victory",10
What is the god damn point of flicking the ball now? Just fucking go have a swing at every single delivery.,3
KHaleel doesn‚Äôt wanna bowl next over,1
"64 off 3 overs, can they do it?",1
There was definitely a sound of dhoni's bat,1
Jadeja keeping all strike?,1
You know it's bad when you take 15 runs in an over and the asking rate still goes up.,5
This bhenchod match is done. GD CSK you could've had this one.,5
deffo nicked,5
Dhoni with his selfish innings costing another game. When you have Bravo and Curran to bat you start swinging from 12th over itself.,1
I see this match is going till the last ball. Interesting.,2
Did they not hear or do they not want the wicket? Bairstow had a weird expression.,6
was that a nick or jaddu vibrating in fear?,10
Rahul Tewatia > Kedar Jadhav,8
Sam Curran is honestly the only reason I watch CSK anymore,12
RR needed 51 off 18 in the Tewatia match,7
CSKs run rate has finally reached 6 in the 17th over,10
SRH Masterstroke: Didn't appeal so that Curran and Bravo doesn't come now.,12
At this point Dhoni should just walk such that Sam or Bravo can come in and finish,0
fuck all hearing that ...and there is no crowd either ..,4
"Guys, you dont understand the 17D chess. Dhoni taking it so deep eventually he becomes the final evolution of Tewatia and Mega evolves to score 48 off the last over",10
Umpires cant give out unless there is an appeal right?,10
Jadeja 3 fours + some luck - hopefully CSK can make this interesting even if they are only playing for Quantum of loss.,7
Bois started playing for NRR. Noice,9
Khaleel Ahmad's over will tell us how close it is actually going to get,3
That was second time I heard a nick and no one appealed,9
"Oh no, an injury",4
"Maybe they didn't appeal to keep jadeja at the crease, lol.",12
Bairstow is deaf confirmed,13
That camera angle made it look like he was getting sucked off,5
"Since they have Bravo and Sam.

Why they fuck were these two playing this slow. They shouldn't started hitting 2 overs earlier",10
What was the purpose of this partnership when you have sam yet to come,8
How the fuck they don't hear that,4
Looks like the Cricbuzz ball-by-ball commentator is a massive CSK fan,6
63 off 18 is not miracle in IPL. Seen that shit happen way too often.,0
"If Dhoni retires this season, ravi Ashwin should come back to CSk and captain them",8
"RRR:20+

Hmmm ideal time to *start* showing intent^TM obviously",11
"You gotta agree with the influence of Dhoni.

Even now the match is all about him",13
Nattu?,2
Inshallah boys played well,3
"Dhoni spending time on the field so that when playoffs arrive, he is raring to score a splendid 1(8)",6
Need RCB bowling attack to lose from here,6
Its that shit music..i think bairstow is blocking all sound and not just noise,3
Wtf umpires still simping Dhoni,4
Atleast we can have Sid Kaul in the next match!!,1
"I have been a hardcore CSK fan since IPL 1, but this year I don't want CSK to even qualify. This should make Srini Mama so freaking mad that he completely dismantles this team made up of old uncles and start afresh in the upcoming mega auction. I have read Mike Hussey say that Dhoni can be very stubborn with his approach and won't listen to anyone and maybe there is some kind of tension between the coaching staff and Dhoni with regards to the approach. At least this IPL should make Dhoni realize that he is too old and retire giving way to some younger talents.",8
"How many fucking ads, fuck you Star",3
Dhoni should open. Maximize potential.,2
Khaleel faking injury so he doesn't have to bowl at the death /s,7
Lord khaleel is down.. CSKs only chance at winning this game is gone,5
"Motherfucker, looks like Khaleel has picked up a knock.",4
Why does every single match in this IPL feel like fixed?,-2
Why didn't they show an ultra edge for that possible edge?,4
Thread moving so fast no one will know that I fap to Warner's moustache,7
So much bootlicking that even when Jadeja is hitting fours Hindi commentators are praising Dhoni saying how tactical of him to send Jaddu to bat lol,16
"Feel sad for the UAE people, they get to listen to tera pyar hukkabar",8
"21 each, simple one uncles you can do it",5
"No Khaleel

SRH need to finish the match in the next 2 overs",3
I have no clue what their justification this time will be. Dhoni came at 5 also,3
"Now that K Khaleel is injured, no chance for CSK to win this",5
Just bowl decently and you win this. Decently not even great.,5
Lol khaleel doesnt want to bowl and we think the same,11
We might not see Raina again in CSK jersey. Mama‚Äôs outburst has a deeper story even after they tried to patch it up,5
Have no fear when Dhoni is here - Random Indian fan in the stadium during 2019 semifinal,9
"MI with Pollard and hardik scored 62 in three overs yesterday, if Dhoni can pull this off it will be a miracle",12
This over just shows why SRH has PTSD against CSK,7
"DeKock, Pant and Parthiv would have bullied  umpire by appealing if Jadeja edged one to them üòÇ",4
It was Agent Bairstow's plan to avoid Sam Curran. Stop blaming the genius please.,9
Dhoni's 24 off 27 balls in *this* situation is frankly ridiculous.,4
yikes don‚Äôt injure yourself Khaleel,2
Lmao,2
What happened to Manish?,5
Come on manish. Good try though,2
Khaleel to save his good figures for tonight. Good luck Samad / Abhishek,1
Its over for CSK. Don't get your hopes up.,2
Dhoni with 24 off 27 when we thought Jadeja was the villain all along!,6
Punjab in the last game and now csk here last 5 overs bowling from them costing the match,2
SRH are going to lose.,3
Jadeja is going to win this now,6
Fucked!,4
What the fuck,4
"> RRR: 21

Can it happen? Inject me with some hope.",2
"Dude Pandey. SRH trying to gift this match, WTF?",8
Lmao,2
Fuck sake take the catch I want to see a close game,1
Even the craziest of Russell's innings were like 43(15),3
Lol,1
WC 2019 semifinal vibes?,5
bc of his neckbeard nattu asks the batsman out on a date and when they tell him no he calls them a whore and bowls a yorker,2
Lol specialist fielder‚Ñ¢ fucked it up,12
Fixed hai sab- My father.,8
Scriptwriter has begun,8
VVS and Murali have mastered the middle aged men in lawn chairs posture,4
2020 is fucking weird man. First time I've seen Pandey misfield.,6
India's best two fielders dropped catches tonight.,6
FUCK FUCK,3
Deciding overrr,3
"All this tuk tuk is just to increase the NRR - Am I right Dhoni supporters?

Dhoni always plans right?",3
"Khaleel: Dives and saves a boundary. 

Commentary: He doesn't wanna bowl",2
Pandey of all people?,5
Fixing intensifies,2
God damn semifinal flashbacks,3
Won't see Manish drop those often,3
The 2 batsmen who have combined made 62(58) will now make 63(18).....yeah,6
Imagine if they lose this chase without even giving any balls to DJ and Sam. So dumb.,4
The era of dropped catches. I blame covid,3
Tactical drop,1
Pandeyyyyyyyy,3
lol superover ‚Ñ¢ vibes,8
Manish Pandey never drops anything. There is something wrong!,12
Insult to Injury,2
Manish Pandey dropping a catch! We've seen everything!,8
5 no balls please,1
Specialist fielder Pandey with the drop again,1
Oh dew come on,2
Payment sent from srini mama,2
Bring in Bravo,1
At least keep it to 1-2 runs if you can't catch it,1
WC SF PTSD here,5
Lmao is that even real? What are they high on?,1
Reaching BBL levels of catching now.,6
"Surprised with that ,manish is really good fielder",5
You do shit like this and hope people don't talk about fixing,8
No. Don‚Äôt show that replay again. FFS. Let me just think that never happened,6
What is this team doing,4
Chawla chilling in the CSK retirement home.,11
One time I pick Curran over Jadeja in my fantasy team :(,9
Specialist fielder???,7
Second catch miss for pandey,4
Dhoni is gassed.,5
Yorker specialist is here,1
Wow that was a good yorker,2
Natarajan perfect Yorker bro,2
Superover on guys,2
Guys is this IPL or am I watching 2019 WC semi final,6
This sub having Tewatia flashbacks,8
Two words: Siraj Yadav,2
This is the worst fielding I have seen in the IPL as a whole.,1
yo... natarajan,1
worst IPL side ever?,2
Honestly should be taken at this level of cricket,3
dhoni tired after running,1
Dubai lighting really be fucking with fielders there heh?,3
"Ind vs Nzl flashbacks, runout coming?",3
Fleming looks depressed af,4
"Mfers be catching covid, but not the ball",3
Stephen is sad af,1
scriptwriters keyboard goes brrrrrr.,6
We played like we had 6 batsmen not 11,1
Jaddu may get his 1st IPL fifty today,6
"This ipl is just basically master fielders showing that its a skill that can be forgotten very easily ..  


pandey and jadeja both",5
Chennai should get Natarajan next year,4
In the hole! We usually say that for... golf of course.,9
Dhoni could have trained for a bit at least during quarantine. He is playing himself into form in these dead overs when the match is lost,5
Trash from Nattu!,1
jadeja 50. Hmmm what.,8
Just 4 more dots,3
What exactly did CSK do in 7 days.,4
 Poor Nattu getting battered,7
Ravindra Tewatia,10
SRH is trying so hard to lose this game.,10
We're going to fuck this up aren't we,10
Can Jaddu hit more of these,5
Where's the sword bc,5
Jadeja doesn't want to do the sword celebration lmao,4
INTENT‚Ñ¢,5
**FUCK THIS SHIT**,3
Teweja,5
Jadeja should bat higher,4
kab khoon khaulega re tera mahi,5
WHAT ARE WE DOING,8
This can‚Äôt be giving Indian fans good flashbacks...,7
15 me 50 is what happened today morning in gully Cricket,3
Jadeja taking single last over was a great decision,1
Why are the commentators acting as if CSK have any chance of winning the match from here on?,4
If he celebrates I'll cry.,1
Are we kill?,6
I have had enough of these commentators sucking dick but now they‚Äôve moved on to holes like fuck just do a porno and get the fuck away from cricket please,4
Get it in the hole!!,3
First ipl 50 for him I think,6
Jaddu playing for his first IPL 50 not to win,5
This script is becoming too predictable now. Should try something new.,8
Take the strike Dhoni,1
[deleted],1
Limp dick celebration!!,6
"Jaddu celebrating an embarrassment of a half century. Have some shame, lad.",4
"Dhoni 24 off 27

Jadeja 50 off 34",7
Explain why these fuckers don‚Äôt bowl off side to Jadeja who drags everything to leg side anyway.,7
Fucking umpires man,2
KP: Just put it in the HOLE,5
I know CSK is going to win. Some simp is going to get his ass massacred on live TV when he shows up to bowl Khaleel's 4th.,5
Again all the responsibility on Jadeja while Dhoni waits for the last over,5
Noooooooooooooooooooo,4
I‚Äôve learned not to get my hopes up with Jadeja and Dhoni combo,3
Anything short of 4 sixes in this over will see CSK end up losing,2
"Chennai are gonna win this, aren't they? Fuck",4
[removed],6
"""Get in in the hole...usually say that for golf, ofcourse"".
Sure Slater, that's the only time to say it.",7
Why to take it that deep.,1
Hope Jadejas sword swings good enough to take CSK to win,1
Oh Bhai.....I've a bad feeling about this,2
Don‚Äôt dont get the sword out. Not done yet,2
"First ever fifty for jaddu in IPL, WTF",3
First ever 50 in the IPL for Jadeja. Wow! Never would've guessed that.,4
Lol first 50 for Jadeja in IPL,5
Chad Jaddu not caring about anything and doing his sword celebration,3
"If csk wins, I'll eat my own shit",3
"Oh c'mon... Don't make me think this is fixed

That non call on the edge, and Pandey drop is getting me suspicious",4
I don't think I could ever hate Jadeja,2
Jaddu probably thinks this is first innings,3
"I don't think I will be able to recover if we lose this. Please boobie, you are my only hope.",5
Scriptwriter is having the time of his life in this IPL/s,5
"Don't worry, SRH fans. CSK is trying to manage the NRR here. They don't play for wins anymore.",7
"r/Cricket, chill, CSK will not win this. It is almost impossible",9
He actually celebrated?,3
jadeja used a cheat code lol ...bairstow's hearing,5
50 off 15 is a great chase IF bhuvi doesnt exist,10
Did he try to do his sword dance and gave up?,6
World Cup Flashback.,3
Yess the sword!,2
Hey atleast jaddu tried,7
get ready for another super over guys,4
20+ last over chase today?,3
Jadeja doing a tewatia,5
Jadeja's first 50 ever? Surprising,7
First Ipl fifty after 12 goddamn years,3
"I‚Äôm confused by that car...music box on wheels?

Basically ‚Äòthis car is a bit shit...but it‚Äôs got a radio soooo lets market the fuck out of that‚Äô",5
Doable or no?,2
Srh should retire of they lose from here,2
Jadeja suddenly at a strike rate of 147 wtf,3
my God whats happening,1
Every. Fucking. Match.,2
Jadeja looks exhausted.,3
"Good innings jadeja, this innings is also reminding me of semi finals memories",5
This is Ravi Jadeja's first IPL 50! Let that sink in!,7
"Meh, CSK have lost this game, no one can do a 15 ball 50",1
Lmao,1
Jadeja out.,2
Does anyone watch tnpl. How is jagadeeshan,2
No Jaddu don‚Äôt skip the sword celebration :(,5
Quite shocked it's Jadejas first 50,10
SRH need to keep their nerve here,6
This was gonna happen I fucking knew,5
"Never celeberate early, remember this kids",3
Lmaooo kekwww all that sword celebration for this,3
[removed],24
"Jadeja: ""Bhenchod""",3
why does every ipl match seems fixed for entertainment,-2
Jadeja has hit batting form or some resemblance of it. So with Jadhav not bowling Gaikwad in for him next game I guess.,2
Jadeja with a 50. Something to cheer.,6
Jadeja protecting his shoulder and elbow during the bat twirl - risky celebration when you get older.,10
Half-hearted sword celebration there,12
CELEBRATE NOW. TWAT,5
Stuff that sword in your ass now,18
Samad is good at holding things,4
Hahahahahahahahahahaha... Butchered by Sir and Thala!!!,6
Srh wanted to give Jaddu his 50,6
never doubted Nattu,6
"Jadeja and not finishing games

Name a better duo, I'll wait.",10
"CSK is done, they are not going to make the playoffs this season.",4
Hahaha jadeja got fked,2
This is just like the wc semifinal. Jadeja doing all the work while the commentators either talk up dhoni or blank how little he's actually contributing,11
"Yeah we have seen people chasing 51 from 15, but not CSK.",7
Good stuff jaddu,4
Oh phew,3
Haha commentators still sucking on Dhoni,18
"Even 203 SR isn't going to do shit!!

That is like 12 runs/over. Need 20 here.",5
Hit some sixes curran,4
Didn't they try to cross before the catch was taken?,2
"""Devudu"" Warner Anna _/\_",3
"Now, the new batsman will try to hit it away. Next over is Bhuvi. Should be fun to watch",2
used a cheat code ..got a 50 .. bbyeeeee,3
YesSSSSSS Natttuuuuuu,3
FingersPointingUp^TM,3
The hope died quickly,5
[removed],2
We will reach 150 maximum. Another chase that might look slightly close on the scorecard even when we lost the match in 12th over. If this season isn't a wake up call for the CSK management I don't know what will make them take notice.,3
"Other batsmen also played slow, why are you only targeting my Thala /s",5
First fifty in T20s for Jadeja. He also completed 2000 runs in IPL.,4
LOL get that 50 & dip,4
"More importantly, this is a dot ball(Read in Harsha Bhogle's voice)",7
Sam make it happen Curran,5
And now the set batsmen's gone,3
Wait for Dhoni couple of sixes in last over when match is long gone..,11
For CSK's sake I hope they didn't cross,5
Same as semi against NZ . Only Jaddu trying.,9
"Wtf is wrong with KP (and the rest of them)?

Just after jadeja's wicket: ""But MS is still there!"".",27
Dhoni to shed all responsibility from here by *rotating strike*,8
Ah lye,3
CSK players look spent. Do they all secretly have the Coronavirus or what? They just look tired and fatigued af.,10
"You fools, you've unleashed the GOAT finisher Sam Curran",13
Lmao who celebrates his fifty in a high pressure run chase before it is finished. Nahh he is a RAJPUT man,6
[Fleming to Jaddu](https://i.imgur.com/XTh3BnN.jpg),2
Well done bois,3
"**17.4** Natarajan to Jadeja, OUT, **picks Samad out at deep backward square!** **114-5**

RA Jadeja c Abdul Samad b Natarajan 50 (35b 5x4 2x6) SR: 142.85",2
Can someone tell the commentators to stop sucking dhoni off? He already came man. You a,14
Dhoni's still there,4
Fleming must be seething inside,0
Curran and Bravo worry me,6
Even if sam hits two sixes dhoni will fuck this up in the next over,5
One should know when to sword celebrate,7
Bad idea celebrating a milestone when the job isn't done.,5
CSK need Warner bowling and Albie Morkel batting rn,7
WE DEMAND SCURRAN,6
CSK‚Äôs main issue has been that they play too many dot balls.,7
"Samad 18
Garg 19
Abhishek 20. 

Love it

All turning out for SRH",9
Sam ‚Äúremember the name‚Äù Curran?,12
"6 balls 40 runs needed, and then Dhoni will hit 3 sixes and will lose the game but stay not out.",4
Dhoni on 24 of 27 since Jadeja was on 23 of 25.,7
Dhoni has more screen time in ads than the time he spends on the ground playing actual T20,7
Next level mental gymnastics in that white hat jr ad with the disabled padmashree awardee,4
If Dhoni just got 15 more runs at his end this would have been possible. 24 off 27 is inexcusable.,8
Dhoni chatting Rashid up?,5
If there‚Äôs anyone I‚Äôd back to score 51 off 14....actually in this tournament so far it‚Äôs probably Archer but Curran‚Äôs up there too.,4
Watch as M sir now reduces NRR,2
"End of the era of CSK dominance. CSK fans should be less harsh though. CSK's 2018 mega auction focussed on short term impact over long term investment. They got into 2 finals and won one if them. All analysts predicted them to be last in both seasons. 

Age has finally caught up. MSD should retire after this season and Dhoni-Fleming can be involved in the CSK think tank.

Next mega auction CSK should go fresh. Will be interesting to see how much of an influence MSD will have on auction picks.

Even though I have disliked CSK as rivals can't deny they have been an all time great franchise. Respect",13
Ah yes WC19 flashbacks,7
"Running twos, edging the ball because they can't hit it cleanly every ball. Very interesting they didn't think of that when they were watchfully playing 5 dots an over.",2
This is Jadeja's first 50 in IPL? Wtf. He's been playing since first season too.,4
Waiting for someone to say you can't blame Jadeja here as his SR is almost 150. Also waiting for Dhoni to hit sixes in 20th over.,2
"Dowload Cred baby dowload Cred.

It's a little addictive to be honest",2
I'll name my first born Sam if he pulls this off,8
"Has Jadeja performed with the bat very few times for India? Because everyone seems to keep remembering those handful of innings, much like Wahab Riaz's world cup spell to Watson",1
Match winning 24 of 27 here,3
Whats the jighest chased ever in 14 balls?,1
"Every innings Dhoni tries to prove that the match vs England in 2019 wc wasn't a deliberate attempt to get Pak eliminated, he was just not capable anymore",0
Dhoni has to go vintage mode to win this,1
Akshay Kumar is everywhere man,1
Fucking Dhoni making deals with Rashid in the middle of the match. This guy doesn't care about the cameras no more.,3
Why is dhoni always after the Yuvraj 50(12) record ? Yograj Singh should investigate,3
dhoni didn‚Äôt even cross lol,4
Are commentators really truthful in saying MSD is still there or are they actually trolling him? I am confused,2
I physically cringe every time a cred ad is played.,2
Just started watching. What the fuck is dhoni doing lmao. 24 in 27?,4
At least we gonna see the obligatory Dhoni last over 1-2 sixes,2
SRH owners acting all nervous like there's any way they'll lose this from here lol,3
Anything less than 30 to defend for Khaleel and we'll lose this shit..,5
PTSD fuckkk,3
Man it would be pitiful if srh loses now.,9
At least Jadeja gets out trying instead of shamelessly playing out the overs like Dhoni.,4
Jadeja knew *exactly* what he was doing,3
Horny cameraman at it again... Covering hot chicks,11
"Sam Curran should have been sent before Jadhav, Dhoni and Jadeja. I believe it's too late now for CSK.",3
Aah mff,2
Damn,1
Curran has been unleashed,2
"The fuck nattu, the fuck",1
They didn't even cross? Wtf?,8
Dhoni did not cross ? Lol what a coward,1
Amazing Shot,1
How cheap is Hardik Pandya ..refuses money for a regular cricket ball that he smashed to fuck all ...,3
This sub just collectively orgasmed,5
Fucking KNEW Dhoni wouldn't want to cross. Dude's a coward.,10
Learn from that dhoni.,2
"Dhoni gonna pull off a Tewatia, I‚Äôm telling y‚Äôall",-1
Taht sound tho,2
Curren maame,4
Jeez what a shot!,4
[deleted],6
Now I think Dhoni's decision was good to come late,4
One more six to have any chances!!,5
Too Short of a ball tbh. Yorkers man,1
Oh shiiiit,1
How many times has Curran started with a six?,1
Sam what a chad,1
"No one:

Absolutely no one:

Kiran More: *Gehra Chhakka*

Trans: Deep Six .",5
"My friend 3 days back: nattu is shit ,all his wickets are lucky

My friend today : nattu can play for India in future

Reason : he had him in his dream 11 team",1
Daddyy Sams here,2
Nattu undoing his good work ffs bowl the YORKER,2
I will say it again. Open with Sam Curran from next match. Drop Watson,5
Jeez. What a shot,1
Curran babyyy,2
Yorkers Nattu,1
Hooking your first ball for six is classic Sam Curran,7
Lmao all SRH fans were shouting fixed when Jadeja had started hitting it,3
Kick out jadhav . Without his 3(10) this could have been close,3
yessss... give me those fantasy points baby...,1
Bc kaisa chu .why bowl short,2
"Oh God, Oh no",1
Yeah.. why wouldnt you send man in form Curran early.. why.. this CSK management is bonkers..,4
Bois Sam make things happen Curran is in!!,2
Hahah... Jadeja was smarter than Gavaskar thinks. There was a good reason he didn't hand the strike to Dhoni.,6
"Just like the World Cup semi-finals, Dhoni screws Jadeja by piling on the pressure from one end.",4
"1st ball, 2nd deck lmfaooo",1
It's happening,1
oh sam fucking curran btw,1
Sam Curran is a fucking beast. England is dumb for dropping him all the time,2
"Damn man, wasting balls with Curran and Bravo back in is criminal",3
"Jadeja

> Gets promoted up the order to take the spinners on

> Plays shit ton of dot balls and shows no intent 

> Gets three lucky boundaries through some shitty Bhuvi balls, another one through a drop catch 

> Celebrates fifty without an ounce of shame 

> Gets out the very next ball after scoring a fifty.",11
"Come on crease, take strike, hit ball for six. That is how the SCurran roles.",2
"My dad just asked me is CSK playing against CSK because all he can hear is the sound of commentators sucking Dhoni's dick.

Hindi T: Ye sab Dhoni ka lund kyun choos rahe hai?",6
fuck yeah sammy boy,0
Come on srh. Don't give up,3
Contender for shot of the season,3
Natty just bowl a yorker,3
What's Curran doing with this bunch of old men,8
Sam Curran to make up for the mess created by Dhoni,6
u/mattytmet here is Scurran to bop a few,3
"Fucking hell Sam, that‚Äôs massive.",3
The hope risen again,2
Fuck no,6
Sam Curran vs Indian bowlers. SRH should be scared,11
Curran must be fuming having just had to sit there.,9
Shouldn't have claimed the boundary catch of Jadeja either ...now tolerate this little shit,7
Classy,2
Lol why do I keep expecting miracles to happen. Oh how the mighty have fallen,12
Albie morkel vs Kohli flashback,8
Omfg,2
Nattu no longer Yorker baba,2
Fucking hell! How does little Sam generate that much power?,10
Sam fucking Curran.,6
SR of 600. Cannot beat that,8
Dhoni playing terribly and Sam Curran whacking it? This must be terrible to watch for Indian fans,6
Fucking Natarajan had to be good only against us.,6
"Has the ability to bowl the Yorker, still bowls short to an English batsman.",11
"I like CSK. CSK is my work ethic: you start off completing your work on time for the first week, and then it all falls apart from there onward. 

You then coast through the school year, spending more time analyzing if she'll check the work tomorrow or not. If yes, you do the bare minimum to secure a high B. 

If no, you take your damn time until midterms and strategize how much of the bare minimum you'll need to put to rank top 4 in the batch (NRR). When finals come, you don't know what the fuck the paper is saying but infer by process of elimination thanks to ""bits and pieces"" of knowledge you have that save your ass.",24
Curran needs to bat higher. Only player on this team willing to go for it from ball 1.,9
Take the strike Dhoni you coward,4
Dhoni retaining the non strikers end.,12
"> Natarajan bowls nice Yorkers, wins us match
>Natarajan suddenly now bowls short, gets hit for sixes.",7
SRH are going to get fucked here... Khaleel is still not in and you're going to have to bowl someone else... Hahahahahahahaha,3
Why aint he bowling yorkers?,5
Dhoni hasn't batted in 3 overs,6
Ever since Fizz we haven't had a decent death bowler. Natarajan has all the looks of a decent death bowler and hope he gets better.,6
Murali is pissed,5
"Please Boobie, less than 15 please..",3
Curran... Take it easy dude,4
If dhoni fans call his innings a masteeclass if CSK somehow win I don‚Äôt fucking know what I‚Äôll do,6
Why the fuck commentators are overly dramatic. Mellow down bitches.,7
Curran be like I ain't playing for NRR you plebs,7
Thala will take strike in last over,7
face a ball you ‚ú®coward‚ú®,4
If only they thought to send in Curran sooner..,5
Make this a 25+ run over and it's done,3
Smart decision by Curran to take single off the last ball,9
Should've allowed the double,1
Lol Dhoni not getting the strike,4
EVERY. FUCKING. MATCH,3
cUrRAn dEniEs dhoBi A sECOnD RuN,7
Dhoni hasn't played a single ball in the last 2 overs.,9
"Single. 

Good",3
Lmao curran just denied dhoni the strike,11
Smart boi Sam. Keeping the tail ender off strike,7
"Sam will cunt 2 more sixes and give us hope and get out, I'm not ready for this",4
Stay at the other end dhoni,1
Need Kohli to bowl the 19th over,3
Watch khaleel bottle it now,4
Match got vaguely close once CSK was able to keep Dhoni off strike for a couple overs,4
44 from 12 is batting team's game when 6 of those balls are to be delivered by Khaleel,2
r/cricket jinxed Nattu,4
Imagine doubting Sammy,4
Farming strike,1
Dhoni is like a cow on ice. Can't wait for him to shit the bed again,3
Easy peasy now,1
If sam faces 12 balls then maybe they'll get close,2
CSK fan bois after the match - We didn't win the match because Thala didn't get enough strike /s,4
44 off 2 overs,1
Srh gonna lose this liek the chokers we are,1
Classic Dhoni innings. Waiting for the last over with an atrocious strike rate and putting all the pressure on the other end.,8
Need a 10-12 run over from Bhuvi,1
Good single. Keep Dhoni off strike.,3
"CSK doesn't deserve Sam Curran. Any other team, they would promote him up the order. Here we still play Jadhav, Jadeja like retards.",8
"19 runs , WTH. We should have stopped them before. They have more chances of winning now. There is khaleel over",3
Bhuvi should finish this in this over. I am not sure about Khaleel,3
"well, well, well... 

> RRR: 22",5
"Honestly, the Fairplay award is the only one that ever mattered.",3
Should‚Äôve sent out Curran instead of dhoni,3
Curran gives me PTSD since the England tour..I just can't watch him bat,3
-,6
Dhoni already sweating in his pants. His slow innings would be more painful now.,2
How did world's most shrewd captain turned into a six sixes per over or bust is beyond me. I just need a wall to yell at right now because nobody listens at CSK.,5
"Good choice to take single last ball,",1
Is there any way for a man to have Sam's babies? Asking for a friend....,3
This isnt strategy. This is pure gamble,4
SCurran may as well just open for CSK from now.,9
Dhoni did not get to bat much in the past 2 overs and we all feel it‚Äôs actually a good thing. 2020 is real folks,3
"Curran hogging the strike after facing 2 deliveries, ya love to see it",2
"If CSK win this I'll delete my reddit account.

Big bet I know.",7
Another winnable match lost by CSK because they can‚Äôt rotate strike.,4
Please finish this Bhuvi üôè,4
Samad might be bowling the last,1
Less than 25 in the last over and we've lost.,8
7 strikes out of 12 balls.,3
Time for srh Bois to start reversejinxing,3
"Sam Curran on strike, nice. Hope he **turns down singles** and go for six every delivery!",13
"Should have sent him up higher. 

Jadav fucked this up hard",2
Don't fuck this up don't fucking fuck this up,5
In the hole,1
"You either die a hero, or you play long enough to see yourself become to villain",2
Thala leaving too late. Never learns üò™,8
The lady in the Whitehat junior ad might be a disabled veteran but i am surely not the only one who wants to punch her in the face.,10
[removed],1
Thalassemia please sixer,1
"oh no, Khaleel with last over",2
Curran should open from the next match,2
In the hole really,1
Only chance to win if this over goes 30+,1
The hole.,2
"MS might have lost his batting form but it is obviously better to give strike to Curran at the moment, don‚Äôt criticize him for that",8
Now imagine how close CSK could have got if they‚Äôd tried...,4
"Dhenier vs Boobie. 2016,2017 PTSD!",2
Commentators just making sure we don‚Äôt change the channel and see all the ads.,3
"High time, MSD retires from IPL too",1
We're gonna lose aren't we?,4
Only tewatia can pull this match now,5
7 sixes in 11 balls to tie the game.,3
If dhoni gets out csk have a chance,10
"Ridiculous the kind of of talent coming out of England. I thought India would be the team that will dominate after the great Australian era. But it is England, esp. in white ball cricket that could rule for the next few years.",5
"This is smart batting by Curran, protecting his tail ender from strike.",6
I'm ready for a dhoni onslaught and a Dhoni fans insta onslaught,2
BALL,1
Dokku Dhoni,-1
Slates and kp enjoying the sex jokes a bit too much,2
Dhoni vs Bhuvi. Bhuvi dead now. Feels bad man.,3
Keep it above 36 pliss..,2
Is Pant seriously selling Asbestos sheets,2
Khaleel needs atleast a 30 run buffer. Dhoni smoked Curran for 4 sixes in that last over against RR,9
Best part of the match has been the shots of Murali,11
BHUVI LOVELY YORKER!!,2
"Well, they scored 34 runs in last 2 overs. Can they score 44 in 2 now?",3
"3rd time in 4 matches Sam has proved he can come out and smack 6s right from the start but they sent him in in the 18th over, incredible",12
We're gonna lose this,2
Oh shitttt bhuvi,5
Bhuvi Noooo,6
Oh fuck what was that bhuvi,5
Is kumar scared? I think he is,4
[deleted],16
What the fuck,5
Fuck noooooooo. No no no no. Bhuvi,10
Don't put the ball in your fucking pocket warner,12
"Low key wanna see CSK come back, or even just make it close so we can get some entertainment value for this match.",3
Too much 'in the hole' and pervy laugh. The commentator know r/theyknow,4
"Sam Curran‚Äôs life: Take wickets, hit sixes, sleep, repeat",7
Oh no Boobie injury?,1
Dhoni has hit bhuvi for 20 twice in death.,5
Don't risk it Bhuvi we need you in Australia,5
I'm convinced that u/red_rash 's constant fanboying has jinxed CSK's season this year.,6
"Oh no!!

Has Bhuvi done his hamstring again?",5
Last over is gonna be a spinner right?,2
I am gonna be honest with you guys no one scares me more than Sam Curran. Not even AB De Villiers. My PTSD kicks in when he comes in to bat.,17
I genuinely didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be this close... is it even close or am I over reacting... CSK champions of gaslighting tbh,4
"Why is Dhoni in the Team??

Even Sam is better who is a bowler",4
India v Pak flash backs,0
Bhuvi you can do it. Finish the game,1
Three big sixes coming..... In the last over,7
Chasing only an average total like 164 and practically losing the match before the 10th over requires some doing,6
fuck no,4
Oh no,4
I love how CSK manage to make 165 look like 200+,9
Oh no. Not bhuvi,6
F for SRH,4
fuck sake,1
Ohhh fuck,2
5D chess,2
F for Bhuvi,3
Oh no,2
This doesn‚Äôt look good,6
"If both Khaleel and Bhuvi are injured, goodbye to our tournament.",6
NOOOOOOOOO,2
don‚Äôt u fucking dare get injured boobie,6
Oh no Boobie,2
"Oh my God nooooo, not an injury now",5
Fuck no Bhuvi,4
"WTF how come your YJB has orange cap? 

oh nvm its dress code of SRH",3
Bhuvi gone,1
F,2
Oh fuck. Rip SRH.,3
"blimey ...squished me own balls eh  - Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, IPL 2020",11
It doesn't look good with bhuvi,2
Fixing,1
Dafuq is happening bruh.,1
Oh fuck fuck fuck,3
Oh poor bhuvi :(,3
I. Think bhuvi twisted this. Shit noooo,6
"Thanks Srini Mama,",10
Hope Bhuvi is ok. Can't afford to loose him,4
F,3
I can't even.....,4
See you next year Bhuvi,4
Warner to bowl his leg spin,4
No no no no no,2
In comes Abhishek or samad I guess,5
Boobie is done,5
nooooooo,3
Of course Bhuvi will die now,3
"Fucked, ain't we?",7
no bhuvi,3
SRH strategically trying to put Dhoni on strike,6
No :(,4
"Oh fuck

Congrats CSK",10
Fuck fuck! Who'll ball the next 5 balls?,8
PETITION TO SHUT DOWN NCA ASAP,3
Damn no Bhuvi,2
Seee this BS always happens when we play CSK,5
hamstring?,2
Oh. Oh no,1
Everyone knows he is afraid of the inevitable.,1
"Bhuvi got scared of Dotni Daddyü•∞ü•∞

PS: indian team is fucked. Why is every class bowler getting injured",6
5D chess from Dhoni since he got strike,3
That ad about retirement üòÇüòÇüòÇ,5
Bhuvi has been so unlucky with injuries.. so damn unlucky,3
Shankar would've been so good right now.. you fuckers,3
Fixing smells,-3
It's almost as if CSK are destined to win this one.,3
So that's 11 balls of young Indian spinners now?,3
Oh fuck Abhishek or Samad has to bowl now,3
Dhoni should've retired from IPL as well on that day.,0
"Man, as much I like Curran, I don't want him to pull it off, cause I can't deal with the MSD fanboys I know claiming Dhoni was the reason for Curran winning it...",4
Hopefully it's just a minor injury and he's back next match,5
F in chat,3
Sad to see Bhuvi injured again.,5
csk cant win if srh wont bowl ..checkmate,5
"Bhuvi scared of Dhoni. Didn't even want to bowl 

/s",3
All ads during IPL are good to be frank,3
Hammy? FFS,3
Curran has scored 44 off 17 till now across 4 matches,4
Jesus fucking Christ,3
What did Dhoni tell Bhuvi?,3
Lmao the number of times I've seen Dhoni play this innings,9
wtf,4
"Khaleel was injured and now Bhuvi, chances not looking good",6
CSK black magic in play,3
"Csk matches and drama

Name a better duo",7
oh..no.. these poor guys.. Mitch.. now Bhuvi.. hope it's nothing too serious..,5
SRH are fucked if this is a serious injury,6
Dhoni was gonna pull off the chase in last 4 overs. But jaddu did not give him strike since last 2 overs.,5
Looks like Dhoni and Rashid settled on a deal.,6
Petition to make the fielding ring as boundaries for MS to hit those big sixes.,5
"BULLSHIT NCA

he's been thrice there and thrice been a shitty recovery",3
Bhuvi == Glass. Smh what it could've been,5
"Don't worry Hyderabad you've got the best bowler in the world, KANE!",6
"Imagine being Dhoni - not getting the strike since 3 overs and now this, he's gotta be desperate to smash it now",3
Difficult times for MSD. He'll receive a lot of flak in social media,6
Fuck me. What luck for dhoni.,8
"CSK might be losing the match, but SRH is losing the tournament.",21
Take him off. This game is buried,3
the sexual tension between bhuvi and any injury ever,9
dhoni saw ....goes oooooohhhhh,2
Haha now they have a chance,1
I am broken. I am done with this shit.,3
Inshallah Bois played well,8
Things going CSK way now,2
I feel so sad for Bhuvi he just came back from an injury,8
Where is Vijay Shankar when you need himü§™ü§≠,9
The powers that be are doing everything in their power to give CSK a chance,5
"Player gets injured:

r/cricket: fIXiNg",11
"This is just a setup. Your two bowlers act like they are injured, so you with part timers now and let csk win. What a script.fuck this",5
Who's gonna ball now,2
Money transfer success!! /s,9
"Making 165 look like 235 , what an effort",4
Noooo bhuviiiiiüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,3

Script writer.exe has started working,3
Srini mama with his covert snipers,5

Dhoni & Muralidharan are expecting a baby soon üòâ,-2
"It's like SRH is destined to lose against CSK. Really want them to win this one, they played better",8
"oh man

i dont want csk to start winning again",7
Feel bad for SRH. So many injuries,2
"Fuck i can't handle bhuvi injury,",5
I don't even want to see it,3
"So Khaleel bowls the last over, which leaves either Samad or Abhishek to bowl these 5.",2
Dhoni's retirement ad is so on the money with him batting at 24 (27) lol,19
Please let Warner bowl,3
Dhoni has gotten his luck back,4
This is extremely bad for srh they were anyways looking short on bowlers. Guess this just makes matters worse. Too many selection headaches for the next game i guess,2
Dhoni is gonna hit now,2
It's either going to be Abdul Samad or Abhishek Sharma,3
"If this is Bhuvi's last match, SRH is very much f\*\*ked for the season, forget this match.",10
Mannnn whyyyy üíîüíîüíîüò≠üò≠üò≠,1

And now Bhuvi's gone with a cramp,2
"Gutted for Bhuvi, and whoever finishes his over. Dhoni will get redemption by destroying him.",7

"Fuck. No Bhuvi? No Khaleel?
Spinners in the last two...? 

It was fun while the dream lasted :'(",6
Give the ball to Williamson already,3
"> Bhuvi almost trips over as he charges in to bowl against Dhoni. He's struggling and **I think he has pulled off his hamstring**.

No not again Bhuvi.",7
Bhuvi scared of getting spanked by MSD again /s,4
Don‚Äôt remind me... ffs,1
This IPL in the end will prove the theory ‚Äúsurvival of fittest ‚Äú. It is brutal out there & I am not sure how teams will handle mid afternoon matches,7
this is going to super over.,1
Bhuvi's next 5 balls is very crucial for srh. Hope you recover soon bhuvi,2
Looks like samad is going to bowl. Haven‚Äôt seen khaleel after that little stretch at the end of 17th over.,6
Match fixing confirmed.,-1
"Oops it doesn‚Äôt look good for Bhuvi, he was just staring to get back to his best and even though I want csk to win I don‚Äôt like this",4

Really excited to watch DC vs KKR tomorrow.,4
Russell in Sharjah? Bah gawd.,12
Csk Bottom Fragger,3
Further tuk tuk tactics to come... CSK is officially auto rickshaw of this season,5
Samad to curran would not be a great idea,5

"Did you guys know every child in the world will now make their own apps? 

Oh, you did. Fair enough.",10
"What a tough world being a bowler is! Bowl too much, you get injured. Bowl too little and you get injured too!!!",6
[deleted],7
Guys stop reverse jinxing. Dhoni can't even hit shit even if Kohli bowls now. He is in such terrible form.,8
Poor Bhuvi,2
Bhuvi is our slowest pacer and he is more injury prone than all of them combined wtf,3
Dugout wanting a full over of spin in the last over. They clearly have forgotten what Dhoni did to Axar a couple seasons ago,3
Another masterstroke from thala üòçüòçüòç,3
Fucked,2
Kane Williamson to bowl?,7
Should bowl khaleel now lol,5
Crap. This will be a big blow for SRH.,2
you know what this means... bowl kanos,8
Absolute scenes if SRH bottles this.,11
Bhuvi seems fine. Hopefully.,2
BC Khaleel pretends to die then Bhuvi dies when you just have to bowl decently to win the match.,7
Dhenier was saving himself for this moment,5
Warner needs to show real leadership here and finish the over himself.,2
Thala knew that bhuvi would get injured. Love you thala,4
Bhuvi is finishing,2
Three sixes c'mon dhoni,3
"Hope it's not too serious with Bhuvi. We go to Australia straight after the IPL, yeah? Would want him to be available there.",3
Ohhh he is backkk!!!,4
Bhuvi don't force yourselves out man. We don't want another Marsh situation.,15
Bowl yourself Warner you coward,12
Come on Bhuvi üî•,4
"If I were SRH I wouldn't want Bhuvi to bowl. Game is pretty much done, they need to think long term.",4
Now this could really be a game changer,3
Break in the game should be good for srh to slow down the game and break momentum. Silver lining,1
SAMAD CAN GO FOR 36 lol,3
Mind blowing they haven‚Äôt used Curran up the order... he‚Äôs narine but with the ability to bat,6
The fix is in.,-2
I've been saying this for the past hour that CSK are going to win this...,2
"All this so that dhoni starts smacking, I mean it's only today I've realized how IPL gets fixed, ridiculous.",-4
No need to risk Bhuvi like they did with Mitch,3
Bhuvi don't risk it please,1
Bhuvi no. Just get some rest,3
If Bhuvi is done this season then SRH is fucked.,3
"As much as I want to see Bhuvi pull it off for SRH, playing on might aggravate the injury and come back to bite us before the tour of Australia",10
Last over Khaleel üò≠üò≠,2
Don't risk your tourney for one match in which you're already 90% favourites,6
"SRH sent in injured Marsh to bat against RCB, and now they're persisting with Bhuvi lol",2
I just want to see Thala charge down the track only to prod it to midwicket.,4
Abhishek Sharma?,1
Dont risk it ..its a matter of health more than anything ... go rest bhuvi ffs,3
Fuck SRH has been so unlucky with all the injuries since the beginning of the season,3
Don't make him bowl u idiots,5
Dhoni run out for WC semi y flashbacks,2
Can srh afford to risk Bhuvi at the early stage of tournament ?,4
Super over ..??,2
Oh no bhuvi :(  hope that's just a little niggle,5
"Bhuvi don't do this, take the rest. Not worth it.",9
Let bhuvi rest,6
4D chess by Warner injuring Bhuvi before Australian series /s,15
He's done now,1
Bowl Kane,1
"I just realized even Chawla and Shardul can bat, why take it so deep damn it",5
ono he's done.,3
why tf they risking bhuvi... IPL is one thing but we need him for the national side more importantly...,3
Why is Gavaskar fanboying over Dhoni so much.,4
Daddy Dotni,0
"Bhuvi please don't push yourself
Not worth it",5
Man Gavaskar sucks Dhoni off so much,8
Listening to KP is so cringeworthy,4
"Dhoni knew that bhuvi would get injured, he knew all along. The great thala. Watch him win it now!",5
This is painful to watch,5
This is silly just let him go,8
Match gone üôè,1
He's continuing? The fuck?,9
Murali dead inside.,6
Trademark dead pan Murli expression.,4
I hope it‚Äôs not something serious like marsh. Better not bowl now than lose bhuvi for rest of tournament.,5
He's done. CSK matches are just black magic.,6
Murali looks dead inside,8
Oh no Bhuvi,2
Don't risk Bhuvi plsss,3
Warner really wants bhuvi to finish this over. Can't blame him,4
Fucking don't kill Bhuvi for this Warner.,5
"Ffs Warner, just send him off man. Why is SRH forcing him to play?",8
KP was spot on,5
Kaul black magic.,3
Still CSK not gonna win,2
"Man, this is heartbreaking.....",3
Fucking black magic,1
BC just fuck off already.,-1
"Just curious, will they fine for slow pace now?",1
"Warner legspin or illegal kanos off spin, have your pick",2
good ...go back ...its okay ..,1
"What the fuck is happening man, just walk off ffs.",3
Aaaand we're fucked,2
"If my GF can give me a bj like Hindi commentators are giving Dhoni, it will be awesome.",7
"Fuck !!!
Sad for Bhuvi...",1
don't risk it,1
This is Mitchell Marsh all over again.,2
"It's ok if SRH lose this match, but don't put pressure on Bhuvi just like they did with Marsh",2
Just leave it Bhuvi.,1
Shouldn't risk it imo,2
Who can complete Bhuvi's over?,2
I am dead inside,3
Did no one learn from the Marsh injury? Why is Bhuvi on the field?,5
Kudutha kaasuku ennama nadikaran paaru /s,1
SRH wasted a buttload of time and caused Bhuvi unnecessary stress,1
Bhuvi is being an idiot here and risking his career,3
"lmfao, we got fucked in the first game by injuries, and we may get fucked again. Amazing",2
Fuck this is so unfortunate,5
"Oh fuck, hopefully nothing serious.",3
This is going till the last ball. I just feel it.,2
"Sunny G just called Abhishek Sharma ""Abhishek Verma""

Jesus",4
Oh no bhuvi,2
Srh is cursed! First marsh and now bhuvi,1
Bowl Williamson you cowards,6
Just give CSK the win,3
Who's going to bowl last over wtf?,1
Did he say Abhishek Verma? Wtf,3
Feel bad for srh sad,3
hopefully he's fine,2
Who is gonna pay 12 lakhs today.,2
"Irrespective of today's result, after seeing this performance, do you think Dhoni will retire after this IPL?

I do not know how many demonstration we need to get convinced that he has lost it.

Or, shall we have to go through another season of this kind torture?",3
You cant make up this shit,3
"This is silly. 

This game is almost won. He injures this any further and he is done for this IPL.",5
Bhuvi is done,2
"I thought we r finally gonna win against CSK, we have to wait another match. This is gone",3
bro just go off.,3
Give the ball to khaleel Ahmed and then give it to samad last over... atleast samad will have more to defend,3
Bhuvi should bowl spin,3
Prayers up for Bhuvi,1
"Bhuvi just go off man

No term ruining yourself long term for short term gain",1
This is playing into Dhoni's hands.,2
Ffs why would you bowl him again,2
Don't they wish they had Nabi now,3
"This is fucking stupid, he‚Äôs fucking lame.

Get him off the fucking pitch.",1
"SRH's management is horrible. Earlier Marsh, and now Bhuvi. Why can't they bowl someone else?",3
All or nothing move,2
Atleast he's walking off properly. So he might get well soon.,3
did dhoni get a new bat yet?,2
Slaughter please,1
SAMAD VS DHONI,1
Khaleel telling Warner where the batsmen are gonna hit him,3
SRH has had the worst luck with injuries this year,2
Trigger warning for all SRH fans to switch their TVs off. You're going to lose.,2
Khaleel will only get 5. So about 20 are a given off these 5,1
If Bhuvi is down and out SRH can kiss bye to their playoff chances. Hope he is fine for the Australian Series.,1
Wholl bowl the next wtf?,1
Who's gonna bowl the last over then?!,1
Lmao not Khaleel who will bowl last over,1
Imagine the pressure on Samad/Abhishek to bowl the 20th,1
Fuck no Khaleel,1
Thala,0
200 IQ,1
"Ashwin Injured, Bhuvi Injured, Ishant coming back from Injury. Looks like border gavaskar trophy is gone boys.",1
Keep these 5 balls under 10...thats all you have to do,1
Dhoni Vs Khaleel,1
Good move Dave,2
Dotni lmfao,3
19th over more important than 20th.,2
How much did Dhoni fucking pay him,1
"Khaleel?

Why's he bringing him on now?",1
"Smart move!!

Kill the game now.",3
If Bhuvi goes for rest of the tournament.Rip SRH,6
Warner is definitely going to get fined for slow over rate here.,1
Why Khalil now & not 20th full over...,1
who is the genius health expert who decides to continue testing a possible quad tear. just get him off.,2
"Even if srh wins, the margin is single digit",1
This legit looks dodgy,9
Clearly Bhuvi thought he could go on. Warner did not force him to bowl. No one in any team does that.,5
Lol wtf,3
It has found the gap,2
Man shit.,1
Inb4 Khaleel goes for 20,3
Bro what the actual fuck is this shit.,10
Inb4 fixing comments,11
How was that a Four ?,1
Are you guys thinking Bravo is on strike? This is msd guys. No way CSK gonna win,1
Misfield. This is going weird.,2
F for us,4
Fucking Samad,3
"Finding bc, haat. How can anyone leave that.",6
I believe the decision to bowl Khaleel is the right decision.,4
Lmao,6
WTF was that...,4
Ffs srh don't screw this up,2
Wtf Samad,3
Typical SRH bottling against CSK,3
strap in boys i‚Äôm getting that dhoni feeling,4
this is epic since KLs last over to spinner fiasco yesterday,1
Wtf was that fielding,2
Congrats csk ...its khalil,1
I shouldn‚Äôt be laughing rn,5
The fuck was that?,1
"Hard luck SRH.

Inb4 r/cricket shits on Dhoni how he was able to finish on an injured team only",3
Fixed,1
*facepalm* MSD fanboys are gonna orgasm,2
Lololol,3
This whole match feels so fucking fixed.,3
If samad bowls last csk wins,2
Village cricket is back!,1
Now wtf,1
Khaleels curse or what. Lol,1
WTF SRH,3
CSK still not gonna do anything from here. Max they get 18/19 from the over,1
Fixiiiing,-4
Poor fielding,2
SRH doing their best to give CSK the win.,3
"Tactical mis-field by SRH, brilliant stuff",3
Oh my god,2
kya miyaa,3
Dhoni hadn't faced a ball in 30 mins.,3
Fixed op,0
Match fixed ??? Such a silly misfield,0
Amateur,2
That's an awful misfield,3
"Say what you will about Dhoni, dude is still lightning between the wickets. Puts half the Indian team to shame.",4
What garbage fielding,2
100 SR new achievement unlocked,5
Cmon,2
Wtf is this even,3
Everyone helping dhoni,6
"B o t t l e

How is this shit not fixed is beyond me,1
Fucking bullshit fielding,2
Samad ptsd from Dhonis hit earlier?,6
Wtf is that misfield,4
Kohli bowled when CSK needed 43 from 12. Now CSK need 43 from 11 and....,5
Wtf is happening,2
LMAO looks like Dhoni paid a good amount to fix the match.,0
Match fixing confirmed,2
LOL wtf that miss seemed so fake.,4
Kohli bowled when CSK needed 43 from 12. Now CSK need 43 from 11 and....,2
Ooh thala,2
Wtf,1
Lol how just how,2
Thanks KP for that irrelevant golf analogy that made no sense to bring up.,2
SRH are trying their very best to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,3
Srini mama has done the job it seems.,3
Planets now conspiring against Sun?,0
Why would you try to bowl 3 times anyway ? Not worth tearing something up for this,2
"I think Khaleel should finish this over even if he has to lose one ball, Sharma and Samad will be taken to the cleaners by Dhoni which would put more pressure on him in the last over.",1
Fixing 101 lmao,1
Good move giving the 19th to khaleel. You don't want a part timer to leak runs and expect khaleel to defend 20 off the last.,2
"When does Holder get out of quarantine? If this is a lasting injury, they're gonna need him big time. Wonder who they'll drop from the 4 internationals. Def not Warner or Rashid.",2
FIXED,3
Fixing conspiracy theorists watching with interests,2
Who's gonna bowl the last? Samad?,1
yea this game is fixed,1
Jonty Rhodesn't,2
"Can we be any more unlucky? Marsh first and bhuvi next, and it's just match 4.",3
I wonder if diehard thala fans still think Dhoni can win this with asking rate at 22.,2
Samad for the final over is a recipe for disaster. Poor kid,2
"Who shouted ""cmon yaar""?",2
Who will bowl the last over?,2
Khaleel redemption arc,2
I ghasped,1
Samad already under pressure thinking of bowling the 20th he misfields,2
That‚Äôs some 7D chess,1
Too much scripting,1
"What the fuck is wrong with SRH's medical team. Let Marsh risk himself when he was clearly in excruciating pain, let Rashid bat when it looked like he had concussed himself, and now this. Game's not bigger than the player you cunts",10
Bring on the fixing comments. I'm ready for it üòÇüòÇ,4
God just let us win. Please.,2
Strategic misfield to keep Dhoni in strike,2
SRH Sunrisers Retired Hurt,6
"Give the strike over to Curran, old man.",0
Scripted?,-1
Srini dada holding a gun to some SRH loved ones it seems.,4
We all can agree SRH fielding seems Amateur at best.,2
such a crappy fielding,1
What was the misfield? I didn‚Äôt see it.,1
WHAT THE FUCK,1
Shame on fixers,2
"Dhoni seems somewhat knackered, doesn't he?",1
CSK are gonna win. This isn't 1 bit crazy to me. SRH are done.,-1
Honestly he should let Curran take the strike,1
Man i just can't see dhoni like this.,6
Dhoni just has nooooo timing,5
4 every ball and we have superover,1
Is this Leicestershire all over again or a little backhander to make Dhoni look better?,3
Age is catching up with thala,3
"Inside part of Bhuvi is made up of glass and outside part is covered by some flesh, so all he had to do is start the run-up and he gets injured.. That's the secret why he not bowling.. BCCI wont check his body bcoz bcci=csk=dhoni so dont respect them. SRH will win. Dhoni injured Bhuvi. but their daddy Khaleel is back. they can't threaten him with Indian team contract to play badly like they did to Bumrah in first match.",3
"SRH need to alteast give the spinner atleast 25 runs for the last over, although Dhoni looks out of sorts today",1
Hes old,5
Nice running by MS man,1
We should be the only team that panics even at 37 off 9,12
Dhenier to swoop in take away the match,1
"They need 4 runs minimum on each ball!!

Not happening this, no matter how hard anyone can try.",1
M not dhoni fan...but feeling bad for him....,2
25 of 9 and then.....,1
Warner letting the 2 happen  lol,4
"Bhuvi has a heart man, gotta give it to him for attempts.",8
He is literally putting it there to hit in the zone.,1
It's sad to see but he has lost it.,5
Dhoni isn't Pollard or Russel to hit sixes in mishits,3
Dhoni is running out of gas. He hsa batted for 13 overs now. Probably one of his longest IPL innings.,3
"What has cricket viewing become?  


Its 9 balls 37 needed and I am still thinking we are going to lose this .. fml",9
Twoni,2
Surprising to see Dhoni struggling.,2
WTF Dhoni with 100 strike rate,4
It's only fair that Dhoni goes off the field too,2
Has Dhoni forgotten that he used to hit over extra cover ?,3
Csk fixers are better than srh's,4
Piyush 'hulk' chawla,1
I‚Äôm half expecting mid season retirement from MSD,5
"Lmao my dad is going to ""FIXING!!"" overdrive here",3
If dhoni wins this... lol,4
Srini has taken care of this match behind the scenes,4
ffs this match should be investigated and all their bank accounts need to be checked,4
"If Samad has the last over, I Atleast want Khaleel to keep the score under 135",3
Bhuvi :( please be fit for the Aussie tour,10
"Can anyone hear ""Golmaal hai bhai sab Golmaal hai""",5
Pierce Brosnan watching the match very intently,2
This knock has been painful for all the parties involved.,5
"Dude I'm the first to say cricket isn't fixed

But this is legit suspicious",10
Dhoni is tired. Not good for old men to exert themselves like this :/,3
as long as dhoni as on strike SRH has a chance,8
Please don't give last over to Abhishek. I remember what happened to Axar in 2017 like yesterday.,9
Four off every ball also won't win this,3
Ok. This is the first time I am seeing Dhoni struggling with fitness while batting.. must be really sapling there.,9
"CSK basically need 4 runs every ball, why is SRH panicking so much & making stupid mistakes",10
"Dhoni injured, good news for CSK",16
"Win or lose, just let Curran bat. I wanna see someone connect the ball properly.",13
CSK has been incredibly lucky with all these short catches and half chances,13
poor khaleel,3
Dhoni more like dohni,2
"Man, it kills to see him like this.",4
Thala hit six,3
"Player: misfields

This thread: is this fixing?",6
This is just meme-PL now,4
ZERO TIMING,3
"Would love to know what Slats and KP are smoking.

43 off 11. Almost impossible.",8
What's with srh ..no appeals..misfields..bowlers injured..it's like they are losing their shit,4
Ok nothing beats IPL for drama,6
Fuck it's sad watching Dhoni huff & puff. Shitting on him is one thing but man do i feel sad watching him like this,19
"Amazing acting skills by MSD

in the mutual fund ad",16
"Predicted it about an hour back. ""Nicely set up for Dhoni to remain not out and lose by 20 runs.""",9
Just hoping that Dhoni doesn't try to play out Khaleel and try to make 44 in the last over lol,7
Need to have 30 runs as a buffer for final over.,7
People in this thread be looking at stadium shots furiously scanning for Munawar,2
Please give strike to Sam for fuck sake Dhoni. You can't do shit,4
Scored his first half century after playing 174 IPL Matches. He also played 49 T20I matches and his highest score is 25.,3
SRH just wants to keep Thala on strike and just watch the magic unfold,4
This is just Sad,6
That shot reminds me of WC Semifinal,2
CSK folk are laughing already,6
"Dhoni totally out of fumes.

Don't even have tbe power to hit anything.",3
"Give strike to Curran, uncle",3
I understand they have a time limit but making teams play in UAE afternoons is straight up cruel.,6
Being a MS fan this is sad to watch,4
RIP to players who will play in the afternoon tomorrow,5
CSK aren't gonna win another game but their NRR will be off the charts,1
Lmao his shots aren't even reaching the 30 yard circle,1
its kinda sad to see Dhoni bat like this tbh,0
Dhoni facing Khaleel is probably for the best. He's finding it hard to find timing while Curran looks like he's come off a net session,4
"Wow, these commentators are Dhoni‚Äôs personal hype-men, aren‚Äôt they?",6
28 is what we can defend in last over,1
Treating Curran like a Tailender,1
"Dhoni chacha, aap rest karo.",4
Acting ?,0
Prime dhoni would have smacked all of them for sixes,1
15 crores for this dross. Chennai got mugged.,3
Wtf commentators stop simping and call spade a spade bcs,11
Is Dhoni doing a Serena Williams and feigning an injury so that he has an excuse later on?,0
Dhoni's done.,3
Khaleel is ‚ÄúRabada‚Äùing Dhoni,3
Now MS. Dude this match is cursed,8
What's up with dhenier?,1
Just leave the field dhoni,6
"Anything under 30 and we're losing lmao. wtf man, our luck is fucking rotten. Marsh in the first game, Bhuvi now.",12
Nikhil Chopra Irfan Pathan  Ashish Nehra have been embarrassing in their commentary. Absolute disrespect to opposition bowler. They had decided that Dhoni will hit 5 sixes in remaining balls of Khalil and will also take apart part timer in last over.,9
CSK not winning this ...m ready to bear the brunt later ...but doesn't look like they can do it.,4
Aarrgg just finish the match,4
Is dhoni gonna walk off ?,2
"Call it day,umpire",4
Let curran take strike,2
Was that short?,4
Fuck man just give Sam C the strike. You look gassed and still running doubles fuck me,10
When in t20 do commentators act like it‚Äôs super hard to bat 14 overs,6
23 off the last over.,5
Ffs stop running 2 if you can't middle the ball,8
It‚Äôs actually sad to see Dhoni like this.,8
i think dhonis gonna retire mid season,3
Dhoni changing gloves. Attack mode.,2
It hurts to see your idol play like this man. Maybe Dhoni should just call it quits. I don't want him struggling like this,7
This is garbage isn't it,2
Is this even allowed in middle of over????,4
Dhoni looks like Wolverine from Logan.,8
"you've done enough MS, it's okay bro! we get it üëç",8
"""Dhoni sucking ~~in the big ones~~""",2
Dhoni is struggling. More and more I see I think this is the final season for him. Too much effort to get to match fitness.,2
Dhoni uncle realizing that he needs to retire!,4
Good now bring bravo in,5
Gasping for breath after that break really shows what lockdown has done to people,8
retired hurt to bring bravo,3
Age taking its toll on Dhoni,6
"Wtf is happening, first the bowler, now the batsman",6
"What‚Äôs happening first Bhuvi and now Dhoni, wtf",4
Mid over water break,9
curran is playing all by himself on the side pitch,11
"Maybe this will make him realise he has gone old!!

Young Dhoni would have put 2 of those into stands!! Time to retire.",13
Dhoni üò≠,3
Dhoni injured. Equally balanced as all things should be,2
Nautanki dhoni,2
"Required rate is less than 36 till now. So, we will still have to wait for the sixes",7
The shortest over ever,2
Dhoni really tired after the iron man effort of 43 off 39,3
"Oh wait, Dhoni gassed.",2
"Seeing dhoni like this just makes me sad, don't ruin your image for current gen kids, please retire from ipl like gambhir",7
Vivek Oberoi from Inside Edge emerging out of the shadows,6
Wtf David Warner paid more I guess to snatch the match back.,4
What the fuck is the CSK physio injured too? Ambling in like we are playing till tomorrow,5
Getting a little rest.,1
Sad to see Dhoni look like this .  He has gone so old . He has lost all fitness with the 1 year gap .,4
Havent seen a slower jog than that physio..,1
This is just sad,2
"Just need clarity, are people ""claiming"" SRH to be the fixers or CSK?",3
When will this over be over FFS,2
Dhenier looks tired.,2
Dhoni retired knackered.,3
Dontüëèconcedeüëèmoreüëèthanüëè5üëè,3
Warner losing Fair play points to win the match.,3
Lol don't retire hurt please,5
whats with warner and his mustache,5
slipni,2
This is like a more like a fucking battle royale than a cricket match,11
All the banter and debates is great but no one should get injured,10
Cursed match,8
"Prime Dhoni would be at 4, 6 and 4 rather than 4, 2 and 2.",8
"Dhoni looks unwell, someone here mentioned earlier that he looked wrong.",9
Grandpa's thrown his back out again,4
Dhoni should have just given strike to Curran. They need 5 runs/ball. Scurran will at least get out trying. Those desperate 2 runs are irrelevant.,6
Thak gaya bhai roko jara,7
Dhoni faking injury to save face? 10D chess?,8
Hope Dhoni keeps strike,5
If you were new to cricket youd think dhoni is fucking awful,10
What is the wait for? Warner gonna be fined or banned. Fucking bowl already,7
"this is painful for any indian fans, but most of us have to come to terms about Dhoni's form. 


I feel for his twitter fanboys",17
Are you allowed to bring physio when you get tired?,8
"Do the commentators get paid to say ‚Äúcool,calm and collected‚Äù whenever Dhoni is at the crease?",4
Special drinks and rest break for dhoni. Dafuq is this shit.,8
I think Dhoni is feeling nauseous here,11
I think he wants to puke. I know that look.,6
RR < 36 for final over? Dhoni doesn't like this,1
Dhoni taking supplements?,6
What‚Äôs 3D doing on the field,4
Shardul Thakur>Dhoni in batting,1
5D cricket by retiring out to get bravo in,5
"Man, I don't want to remember Dhoni like this. They need to pull the plug on his career. His slow batting is becoming a glaring issue in almost every game.",8
"Bro just take the L, retire hurt

Let Bravo bat",10
Dhoni has a stomach  ache.,1
COVID,5
what's going on?,1
"Slats: ""He is just sucking in the big ones""


What?!",8
Dhoni taking rivital pill,12
"why are they giving bottled water to dehydrating players?! wtf, get him something with electrolytes",8
Breathing issues and checking temperature. Does he have COVID?,12
"With Warner on this one, Dhoni stopped play multiple times",11
"Honestly, no disrespect to his achievements but Dhoni's playing like those uncles who sees kids play and asks to bowl for him",11
Feels like this over started yesterday and still not completed,6
"With all the sucking Gavaskar is doing, I'm surprised he's able to talk so much",19
If this game continues all players will ask for a physio.,11
"Give Dhoni a break guys, he‚Äôs done enough for Indian cricket as well as CSK, it‚Äôs the rest of the team which has gone to shit as well",3
Everyone's pulling their nerves now,3
Both the injuries are a blow to srh,8
We take water breaks during our weekend games here - seems like it happens in IPL too.,9
Dhoni taking drugs /s,5
"It's painful to watch a legend go down like this.

As he aged so much?... Mmmm :(",4
At least Dhoni‚Äôs average will be looking nice. Fucking coward.,9
Warner is worried about being fined for his Over rate,10
day games are going to be brutal. RCB might pick an actual keeper after watching this game.,9
Mouth freshener for Dhoni,9
You cannot change my mind that this match is fixed. Wtf is happening.,6
Dhoni probably has a date after this and wanted to freshen his breath,3
Dhoni making sure Warner gets banned for another year for slow over rate,6
"Dhoni taking break is masterclass and great thinking from Dhoni,he is showing hisbfull experience by stopping the play says Irfan Pathan. 

ü§°",5
I was thinking of putting oxymeter in Dhonis finger to check his Oxygen saturation. It should be 92% as he is experiencing breathlessness.,4
I always thought Fleming would be perfect for james bond! Hahaha,1
Dhoni is definitely sick today. Something wrong. He's looked off the entire day.,3
Who is going to bowl last over? Samad?,3
I hope dhoni stays fit till he plays against us.,-1
I think he said he had that puking sensation.,1
bro... rotate strike bro...,1
This is just sad. He should know he has no power left then how the fuck does he trust himself to play 24(22) innings and hit out in the end,1
Man.. this is heartbreaking.. these guys were my heroes .,3
Does Dhoni have COVID-19?,5
Star Sports must be festing on this extra  ADs time,2
Damn the game is stopped because Dhoni is tired?,2
This might actually be COVID19,4
What the hell is dhonj doing,1
Dhoni is like Master Roshi in the tournament of power right now.,1
Two sixes and it's still difficult af,3
Sad to see Dhoni like this just hang the boots.,2
Needs that minty fresh breath does Dhoni,1
Lol did he just took a break to catch breath,5
This is fuckin bullshit with all these stoppages.,6
Imagine currain denying run for dhoni's strike,2
Who has the guts to say anything to Dhoni?,5
Did Dhoni just pause the game for a spraymint?,7
"What the fuck is wrong this year, everyone is getting injured left and right.",5
Dhoni in the series has constantly looked like he would rather be anywhere else,3
Quick here is some morphine ..just act normal ..just act normal ..,3
[deleted],6
"Worst case scenario, 2 sixes in 2 balls. 23 to defend for Abhishek in the last. Discuss.",1
"Dhoni is 39 officially. Knowing how ages are usually reduced in India (mine was reduced by a year too), I'm sure he is actually over 40

Time to hang up your boots man. You've done enough",0
"feels like i am watching american football..
10 mins per ball üò°üò°",7
MJ had the flu game. Dhoni has Covid game.,1
"Who will Bowl the last over?
Sharma or samad?",3
Is this the longest T20 over ever?,5
"6 sixes in 8 balls.

""CAN MS DO IT?!""",1
The reason why commentators are hyping MSbigD even if he's not gonna chase this possibly is becuz they don't want to eat their words later in case MSbigD does it.,3
Damn it's sad to see Dhoni this way.,1
You need a massage too old man. WTF is happening.,0
Thala 100 SR. Talk now,3
"Doesn't look good. Hope Bhuvi, Dhoni are alright.",3
"Feel bad for Dhoni all you want but it's fucking annoying seeing his **blind** fans and his ads all the time, totally riding the performances of the ancient past.",10
"Cricket, even in its shortest format, allows for so many goddamn interruptions, Bhuvi took way too long to decide that he can‚Äôt go on after all and now Dhoni is basically drinking water and taking some rest in the middle of 19th over",7
"They're accusing Thala of slowing the game down after what Warner did, making Bhuvi run-up thrice?",4
Cool boi Dhoni just felt the heat,2
**suprise mothafackas**,2
"Man it's so sad to see Dhoni the milk drinking long haired ""Dho dala"" guy like this. :-/",2
Curran has taken a nap and ready for another mini explosion.,3
"Our Indian players just don't know when to call it quits. I mean we try to milk our skills as long as possible and this is the result. Dhoni could have exited the game gracefully back in 2016 - 2017 with his head held high but no, we just don't do that here.",6
Batsmen should not be allowed to recuperate mid over. Being tired is part of game.,6
Dhoni snorted a couple of grams in between /s,6
"The only way CSK has even a remote chance of winning this is by hitting the next 2 balls for a six but looking at Dhoni timing the ball, it is highly unlikely!",2
19th took over 20 mins i think.,8
It's so sad to see Dhoni struggling with fitness :(,9
Warner in the ears of Umpires there reminding the world why people hate him lol,4
Yes bhenchod yes,4
Nice rest break.,3
This over started back when Thala was still young.,11
"Dhoni pulling a Trump here. Result about to come against you, blame it on illness.

/s",4
Thank god at least Lara is not sucking him off.,7
Ah a 6. 29 from 7,1
This was painful to watch,2
Samad must be shittinn his pants,6
Why is it fair to give break to a batsman because he is feeling tired ?,12
Dhoni undoing his image by doing what he made other seniors feel bad for : hogging a space in the team,8
All the drama has been sucked from this game by these stupid fucking interventions.,5
What is that delivery,2
Fuck.,2
Can someone throw light on what Jadhav does for the team? They made a good decision dropping Vijay and should have done the same with Jadhav too,3
Piss off dhoni,0
Dhoni to pretend to collapse after this over,1
Nice hit thala,2
single or six here?,2
"Ngl kinda sad to see Dhoni struggling like this

&#x200B;

Nvm",7
"Yes take all the time in the world to play, now he is fine to play. Well done.",8
A spinner bowling last over?,4
The team physios have spent more time on the crease than Bairstow and Watson did.,15
Dhoni with the pill,8
Khaleel jail,3
SRH is killlll hahahahahahahaha,0
Someone as senior as Gavaskar shouldn‚Äôt be so far up Dhoni‚Äôs ass!,5
Can he do it,2
chutiya bowling,2
Wow he has smoked that. Steroids,2
That's one. Need 5 more thank you very much.,1
"What an easy ball to hit. 

This is too obvious man, cmon",3
Khaleel is the most god awful brain dead bowler ever,7
Rip SRH,7
What was that pill? Lol,9
Thala I love you,3
Imma cry now,7
"Senior citizen break, Dabur Chawanprash eaten and next ball for six.",10
Can players just choose to take a break like that or is it coz he's dhoni?,6
Khalil has single digit IQ,1
Oooh boy. Last over is gonna be a doozy,3
Was that the third timeout?,4
Big brain move,2
[deleted],2
"MSD bats 13.3 overs and is exhausted? Thought he was looking fitter than ever!?  
*e:* Pfft, ‚Äúexhaustion‚Äù or not, short shit gets hit!",3
Hydrated Dhoni: new mythical cricketer,9
He is tired so sixes only,6
"what fucking chess is this ...  


took a nice little smoke break and smashed a six ..",7
Damn I've never seen Dhoni this tired before,4
Lmfao Dhoni just called out the physio so he could catch his breath,14
"Say what you will about Thala abilities, his 6s are beautiful to watch",3
"700 IQ move from Dhenier tbh. Take a 3 min breather, put the bowler out of rhythm and then hit a boundary.",9
Bowl it wide of off u cunts,1
this is painful and embarassing but okay,3
Umm what‚Äôs that length khalee ji,3
Brainless bowling,3
"Supplements worked, i guess",5
Dhoni to call for the Chris Gayle mobility scooter for the last over.,6
Sike,3
I bow down to all scriptwriters. Who would've expected such a twist,4
They definitely gave him adderall or cocaine,6
Looks like Dhoni roided up,3
Finally one for the highlight reel. Final ipl innings of the greatest finisher.,4
Dhoni just gave the com box an orgasm,8
Imagine Dhoni winning this from here being 'sick and tired'. Best IPL innings? /s,17
"If Dhoni actually retires mid season (like one of the comments below) my respect for him will rise exponentially.

I remember Ponting doing it in 2013, handing over the captaincy to Rohit and MI winning in 2013.

I would give him 3 more matches just to make sure he doesn't belong",15
I need to know what Dhoni just had,5
Still very much impossible,3
28 from 6. So game over hopefully.,5
Fuck sake dhoni kept the strike - that's game,9
Axar Patel flashbacks anyone?,2
Looks like Dhoni sent extra payments to top David Warner's amount. CSK got the match back unless Warner decides to pay more now.,7
~~Red~~ Yellow Pill,2
Last over is by a spinner right? CSK can smash up to 30 there,1
Should not have taken the single.,2
Axar Patel somewhere out there pooping his pants,9
This is the longest over I have seen,10
Too.Late,3
28 off Samad or Abishek is doable,4
They were literally discussing bowling a slower bouncer in the break lol.,4
Big mistake to take the single,5
Where were you when SRH was kill?,8
Did Dhoni take a senzu bean?,10
I think Dhoni is ill. The physio also touched his forehead,30
"A little too late, although that misfield may come back to haunt SRH.",6
Water = Six,5
They're asking for Yorker to a man who literally invented the helicopter lmao,5
"A 6 when mattered. 

r/cricket died for this.",6
I'm getting cramps just watching this match,9
*Arey bhaisaab mai toh thak gayi*,10
Dhoni on strike 28 to win in 6 with Samad to bowl. What do y'all reckon?,2
"They show that girl one more time, I might end up having a crush on her",7
Haha this is Gold. Sammy C at the non striker,4
28 in the final over with a noob bowling. Poor kid's going to have his confidence shattered,7
"Wow, 28 to defend for a spinner. Should be interesting",4
I am not sure UAE is the right place for a long tournament. Even indians find the conditions excruciating I can only imagine the pain for people not from the subcontinent.,3
nice dhoni on strike. He will hit 3 sixes and waste three other balls,3
"Samad/Abhishek are gonna age a lot in this next 6 balls. 

I gave up hope long back.",5
If he pulls this off...........,3
That srh chick is so good looking,7
Dhoni ate Popeye's spinach during break i guess,5
Dhoni defo looks uncomfortable,4
Dhoni needs to retire.,1
Who‚Äôll bowl the last one?,2
Carrying CSK for the entirety of the last year really broke Dhoni huh?,3
Just dehnier things,3
28.. Tricky!! Dhoni did rip Axar apart a couple of years ago with a similar target. So maybe not Abhishek. Too much to ask from Samad.,2
He has taken the game deep alright.. Now they are in deep sh\*\*.,2
28 in final over should be okay for srh to defend...need just 2 good balls for srh,1
Hopefully Dhoni doesn‚Äôt do what he did vs Axar Patel,2
Samad defend your misfield,1
A minimum of 4 sixes needed against a rookie bowler,1
"Dhoni keeps the strike. Just what we needed, sigh!",3
Is Bhuvi injured?,2
"If Dhoni pulls this match off, I will never ever ever ever shit on Dhoni. Pinky swear.",10
"A suggestion to Dhoni and team: If you don't play so many dot balls early on in the innings, you won't have an asking rate this high.",5
Okay cunts who did some voodoo on us. This is the second game we are losing due to injuries.,2
Lmao the next bowler has to just bowl 2 non boundary balls,3
Axar Patel vibes intensifies.,3
who bowls? abhishek or samad?,1
I have seen like atleast 6-7 deliveries that a younger Dhoni would have cunted out of the park. This is sad.,5
Come on Dhoni! At least have the common sense to see that Curran has better chance of scoring 28 runs in the last over.,4
28 off 6? Don't give me hope,2
"So, you are allowed to just call the physio, hold up play, have some water in the middle of an hour to catch your breath if you are tired?

That's what I call a strategic time out.

Btw, these people are on top in the Fairplay award",6
I still rate Al-Khaleel higher than most on this sub but man he's gotta work on his yorkers. Very rarely bowls good ones.,3
"Dhoni hits a 6: what a brainless bowler

Dhoni doesn't: he needs to retire",6
Cursed over.,1
There‚Äôs literally just 6 balls left... just end this horrid drawn out spectacle,2
Take him out man,1
"I feel ashamed to say this.


But this shit looks like scripted as fuck.


Tons of international games & none can match this script right here",7
Sooo..when's the next big auction guys?,7
5 more bottles pls,3
You know what happens when Thala changes bat....,1
"khaleel is mediocre. 

&#x200B;

BTW what's with all the fishy things. Dhoni is as rich as a cricketer can be. he aint tanking for any amount of money. He will be a business mogul post retirement as well.",4
Fucks sake dhoni. Just play the role of badrinath and let others do it.,2
"28 off 6 with a spinner to bowl to Dhoni, Curran and possibly DJ. Reckon it‚Äôs 50/50

The memes if CSK win lmao",5
"Last over by a Spinner?
Unless Warner decides to bowl his medium pace",2
SRH is kill?,6
Rashid needs to guide Samad on what pace to bowl at & how not to take pressure but Dhoni can crush him mentally here if he gets going,4
Samad jitayega inshallah,1
Samad gonna be samadi,3
Can DW be fined foe delays for injuries ?,1
"Even if dhoni somehow manages to pull this off, the selection of jadhav severely needs to be questioned. Bring in Gaikwad!",1
"Curran can save it, Dhoni seems flabbergasted, is the humidity that high?",1
Hardik with the attitude even in the dream 11 ad.,1

Game over in 5 balls,1
18 year old spinner againt dhoni. Match is not over yet.....,3
No fucking no balls please... Samad,1
"Fuck me, Dhoni is gonna eat the spinner",3
They did say Samad was the finisher.,2
Curran >>> Maxwell.,5
Dhoni just needs adrenalin to get him through,1
"Samad. Man, you can do this.",2
has sham karan got it?,1
[deleted],2
Surely you‚Äôd want Curran on strike against the left arm spinner,3
"As long as no extras and less than 4 sixes, we win.",1
How are they top of fair play table,3
"Saved NRR ‚úîÔ∏è

Good acting ‚úîÔ∏è",9
"That Samad misfield was like the one from the Dream 11 Ad

And plenty of towels in the game too. I have my tinfoil hat on",6
This will be interesting,2
Spinner against Dhoni! Anything is possible!,3
Another Dhoni special incoming,3
I'm laughing so hard now,2
28 off 6 here we go,1
cmon samad I believe in you man,3
Spinner in last over? RIP SRH,2

Good news for SRH. Dhoni has kept strike!,1
SRH wins.,1
[deleted],3
This over is longer than my last relationship,4

Imagine Dhoni wins this. 6th bowler.,2
1st ball 6,2
"I understand that he is a legend of the game but ffs, asking for water in the middle of the over is not a mastermind tactic commentators.

If he did it intentionally, it is a shit move.",5

Hope CSK wins. The meltdown here would be epic.,2
"Dhoni play faster bc, don't take time",1
Dhoni trusts himself so much man. Wish I had that.,6

Too much suss ffs,1
21 off 5 seems impossible but it‚Äôs CSK they fucking curse every team they play against.,4
Abdul Samad's confidence will take a big hit today. and Dhoni will become more arrogant.,2
Script writers have gone the extra mile today.,5

Curran making him run two,3

Oh fuck.. thala is having respiratory problems again,2
"Bruh, SRH should liquidate their franchise if they lose from here",5
Give Sam strike,1
Should've let Curran keep strike there,3
I reckon Samad bowled that wide deliberately to stump out Dhoni.,1
"Dhoni didn't want to take the double there, Curran just ran back lmao.",6
"Why are they not showing I N T E N T from the 10th over onwards, they all just start swinging after 16th over or so.",4

Shortness of breath is one of the first symptoms. That's how many runners have found out something's wrong.. I hope he hasn't contracted covid.. :/,6
Can anyone tell me what has happened to MS? Watching without commentary.. He is struggling..,1
Surely Curran the lefty should be on strike against a leg spinner?,2
Dhoni gasping like me in gym class in 6th grade,6

Intent but no execution,1
*heavy breathing*,4
Why on the earth is Dhoni keeping Curran off strike??,3

Csk is getting lucky a lot. Although it's physically hard for dhoni looks like.,5
HE IS TIRED HE IS DONE YET FIGHTING! YES HE IS FIGHTING,5
Chris Jordan would have stopped that. He's ruined my expectations for bowlers fielding off their own balls,6
Dhoni is panting... Something is not right,12

Curran is more dangerous lol,1
Do people actually think it‚Äôs fixed?,8
Ok Curran has this,3
"What ever be the result, that ball went like a missile, Samad put hands after it passed the crease.",1
Dhoni is just targeting his 50..team be damned,0
Dhoni was done at the WC last year. He's cooked,5
Smh... SRH gonna come hard at us in the next game.,2
646 incoming,2
is dhoni sick? he‚Äôs not looking good,6
"Just one dot ball, and you're good.",1
Dhoni not hitting a half tracker from a leggie for a six in 20th over smh,6
Someone bring a ventilator,4
Dhoni must be cramping up! He seems dead tired.,2
Csk def winning,1
Yeah Dhoni is definitely sick.,3
One good ball and it‚Äôs game over,1
more scared of curran tbh,1
Bowling short seems to be the strategy,1
"Slats, kp and sunny in the box during a tight last over chase might be my actual living nightmare",1
Something is up with dhoni. I have never seen him this tired.,6
Curran taking the piss by taking twos lol,1
This ball should go for one or two pleaseeeeee Samadddddddd,2
6 every ball now,0
Game over. SRH has won this. I dont think Csk can win this from here.,2
"Great if we won otherwise I have acted good enough for sympathy.

  


Like I used to cough in viva.",3
Samad mate do this for us and break the curse.,5
gg! close game! SRH will win it,3
Say whatever you gonna but MSD gave his hundred percent in this innings.,8
Curran is more dangerous here,2
I‚Äôve never seen Dhoni this fucked up man,7
good curran is on strike. 2 sixes and 1 four required from curran.,2
Sam C to hit 3 in a row.,6
This is just painful to watch :/,3
Bowl the googly to Curran pls,1
Huge pressure on this youngster. Spare a thought for him,7
I am scared for him. Fuck this match,11
Does Dhoni hate Bravo?,1
Dhoni has COVID?,3
Dhoni of ipl 2019 would'veput that in the 2nd tier,-2
SAMMMM,1
In b4 646,1
"Warner giving tips to Samad in English, Samad only knows 2 words: OK and Thank you üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ",6
Never seen dhoni so stressed,7
Samad thinking how to lose this,5
"Fuck, I do not think that I have seen MS this tired.",13
"after giving 5 extras of the first ball, its good that samad has kept his head.",6
Samad...no wides/noball ffs,2
Game Over hopefully.,6
This loss is absolutely on Dhoni for being arrogant that only he can do it! Curran would have smoked those chances,15
1 dot ball,1
Lmao,1
No extras Samad.,2
Dhoni drink Gatorade,2
Who tf allowed KP to be commentating during a dramatic moment god just shut up and let us watch daaaamnnn,2
Should‚Äôve given the ball to Abhishek but this kid is also good,3
Finally ffs,1
gg,1
Phewwww,1
Fucked!!,1
Please no ball,1
Don't bowl a wide kid,2
"When you see this, remember there are afternoon matches tomorrow and the day after

I want to meet the genius who thought it was a great idea in UAE",5
Yeah......,1
Lmao they had so much luck on their side and they still lost,5
"Don't bowl extras pls, we have this",1
NRR saved,1
C'mon samad. One no-ball for a six.,1
"Listen Samad, no more wides/no-balls plz",1
Sad to see Dhoni like this,2
Just keep 1 ball dot pleaseeeee,1
Game ends on a weird note. With a injury and a sick dhoni,4
Why doesn't Dhoni go off the fireld,1
"Hope it's just exhaustion or dehydration with MS tbh, and nothing too serious.",8
I am breathing man phew,6
Ohohohohohohohog,1
Dhoni will retire midway through the IPL. facts.,3
Dhoni seems to have lost his strongest weapon: the timing on the bottom-handed cross batted shot. He used to murder those in his prime and now he struggles to even get 60% of them to the outfield. Looks like an age effect.,4
Yaaaaa.. good job samad... Don't give extra ballss,2
Just give him the 2 sixes and win by a run .,2
YESSS!!! game over!,2
Okay SRH have this now.,0
[deleted],6
Innthe final context Dhoni 46 off 35 needed to be 56 off 35 and csk would have won,2
Great balling Samad,1
Is MSD okay? Why is he struggling so much?,5
50% unclench,0
SRH fans can finally unclench,3
Lol Dhoni is so shit,2
WHY AM I STILL SCARED,2
That‚Äôs it then,0
20th over Dhoni?,0
Dhoni has actually batted 14 overs.,2
No extras please samad.,0
Dhoni the untold story part 2,4
Thank you SRH fans for jinxing this match with your constant pessimism,2
Inb4 2 no balls,3
Samad Madlad,2
alright we did it,1
See no way they were going to chase this down. Good on you Samad.,0
Phew! Relief,0
Samad > axar,1
No more wides and we are through.,1
He just can't time it.,0
No extras now Samad I beg you üòÇ,0
"DHONI IS OFFICIALLY FINISHED, LADS",2
If they just sent Curran ahead of Jadhav we could have won here,2
Justüëènoüëèextrasüëè,0
I think it's been a good over,0
Taking it deep is overrated. Glad to debate,2
Most dramatic shit I've seen in my life.,1
Off topic - folks in the US - how do y'all watch the IPL now? Hotstar has recognised my VPN and is no longer working,1
no no ball or wide,0
"They tried everything to win chennai the game, but failed f",1
I'm still waiting for a weird no ball 6 to come from somewhere.,0
SRH won,1
Lmao Laxman finally smiling,7
Thodi der ke liye waha gote muh me thi,0
The boy from Kashmir does it.,5
Butt unclenched finally,7
Thank fuck. Would have been nice if Bhuvi was still fine for NRR though,5
yes,1
"Quantum of loss minimised Bois, job is done.",2
CSK somehow almost did it,11
What a comeback from this young man.,5
Thala has a crazy average this year,10
[deleted],2
Quantum of loss achieved.,5
"Csk would be in the game if they werent so fucking polite in the middle overs, how did they let Rashid Khan go for 12 runs",2
Yes 2 sixes for NRR now Daddy,1
Great inning again to save NRR. THALAAAAAAA FOREVAAAAAA,5
"Ok phewww

Was that planned to be fixed, but just not executed?",8
"CSK just got lucky, still lost !!!",0
Sam curran played for NRR,4
"i dont thin kyou guys understand Dhoni

he is getting closer and closer every single match, once he gets to the target all of u mofos are done",5
Props to CSK for making it interesting in the end.,9
Hum Jeet gaye.gif,1
"CSK, the new wooden spooners.",4
Absolute fucking beaity to toss the ball. This guy is wise,1
Now they hit a six,2
"7 runs, NRR!!!",6
Amazing bowling by samad,4
Samad bowled well.,7
That's a sweet strike by Curran. Good win for the SRH.,2
We won this guys! We finally broke the curse!,7
Raina getting ousted has completely killed CSK's acceleration. With him they are probably 3-1 at worst.,3
man what‚Äôs with the curran‚Äôs and these random sixes,3
I wish Curran had come in earlier,8
Cant watch the game so im hanging around threads. What happened to dhoni? I heard he got injured?,1
Butt unclenched finally,2
Phew Sunrisers got by by just an inch here. What is this IPL lmao you can't predict whatl'll happen even when Sunrisers are bowling,3
"Wasn't someone going to delete his Reddit account?

Should've let curran try,1
"Thank god 2 points, and finally a win against CSK",5
Nvm guys Warner sent a payment in at last second so match is still with SRH.,1
Dhoni's average stonks,1
"I‚Äôm tellin y‚Äôall, CSK will somehow find a way to absolutely F up Punjab in next match",2
NRR achieved,4
"Phew, was afraid for CSK's NRR for a moment. They have achieved what they wanted to.",6
"I'm not used to seeing my team lose like this. I mean it's ok if we lose but this. It feels like they're not even trying. CSK bats deep, even No11 can strike a ball. and Dhoni should stop trying to be the saviour. He's old and he can't do it like he used to. He should just bat further up the order. It's like they just go out there half-assed and then hope they win with some luck or something. Idk man this team just looks hopeless as of now.",1
[removed],3
Jeez...has Sam Curran came out earlier....csk would have won easily...,3
They should have sent curran/bravo earlier.,1
Thalaivaa with very acceptable 130+ strike rate saved the nrr,3
SRH fans who almost lost calling this match fixed under their panicking üò¨,12
">If SRH lose this, 100% fixed.

>I wil stop watching IPL

My comment earlier. Ah, thank God. The faith remians until another day",10
CSK win by Net Run Rate.,7
GG,1
"people criticizing an 18 year old bowling a last over vs dhoni and curran with a wet ball when he wasnt supposed to. in the circumstances, samad kept his head.",14
I mean... NRR not gonna decline much.,3
NRR six on the last ball!,4
Curran would have gotten those runs with strike,3
Nrr boys at it again,3
"CSK preserving ""NRR""",3
at least Curran keeps his 300 strike rate continued,2
"MoM for Garg.

Dronacharya Award for MSD, for guiding Jaddu to a 50.",7
Is Samad's 18 like Rashid's 18?,8
the fairplay award is the only thing that ever mattered üëç,3
Dhoni hogged 19th and 20th over as usual. Curran would've won this for them otherwise,6
Fuck csk,4
Screw you bairstow,1
"Curran finishes off in style. He emulates Dhoni, by hitting a pointless six when it was all but over.",5
Samad did well. Great prospect.,3
i am 31 and i still dont have that kind of beard,6
"CSK and NRR, love story",3
Dhoni shouldn't be giving fist bumps,6
Wtf was this. This was way too shady to not be fixed. Too many things going on at the same time,3
This match had no right being this close,6
NRR <33,3
Only if Curran had got the strike earlier.,4
Boobie is definitely sitting out the day after tomorrow.,3
My heart is too weak for games like this no more please,8
Sam Curran with the last bowl 6. What a joke. He should have been brought onto the field earlier.,12
Dhoni's post match interview should be fun.,4
Last ball 6 is permanent,10
"So Jadhav is responsible for this loss, right?",7
Watch Dhoni fans defending him as usual.,9
fuck,1
Gavaskar just shut the fuck up,8
Bairstow fucked up today. I feel bad for Samad.,8
-,0
At least it doesn't affect the NRR.,4
Statpadding six that by Curran.,6
CSK made a deal with the devil to win against MI this season,3
"When one player is struggling, and the other is known to smash from ball one, why would you not give him strike as much as possible?",10
If you have guys like Curran bravo jadeja in the bank why they have to bat below Jadhav ??,8
Dhoni and his nephew tried well,11
"Dhoni man!

You were a hero and retire as one :)",7
unclench complete.. boys played well..hope bhuvi is okay and recovers,3
I hope boobie is ok ):,3
"This shit has gone for years now and Dhoni still thinks some how taking it deep is the right strategy considering his waning abilities and shit strategy of team selection. 

For someone who was prompt to push away aging legs in his heydays will think he would know better. 

Fucking tired of this bullshit. .When he was doing this blue and now.",13
"Even with everything working your way, ‚Äútake it deep‚Äù is a stupid strategy.",1
Mandatory 6 in the end for nrr,6
"CSK lose, Dhoni to blame.

Business as usual",3
The commentators need to calm down about Dhoni,4
"Huffing and puffing in the end to catch up and still falling short. Maybe don't waste so many balls up front next time, Thala.",6
"Why do batsmen, myself included, still take guard in this situation? Not planning on leaving outside off are we?",2
Curran looked in such great touch but was wasted at the non-striker's end,1
Should we blame it on mahi or the top order ?,-1
"I will blame it all on Dhoni and Jadeja. He should start going early. I hate the take it deep shit.

If you fail, it leaves too much for the other guy",2
Sam Curran could have won them the match if hed come in early,2
That loud sound was of mass unclenching of SRH fans' asses,10
"Man, if Curran got to bat more this would have looked different. Surely, Dhoni has to go?",3
Lost by 7 runs. Doesn't tell full the picture.,5
"If Dhoni would have kept his fucking ego low and given Curran the strike from start, it could have been different story.",2
Curran is batting too low,4
"At least NRR didn't take a hit!!

Moral victory.",3
Yet another great ODI knock by yours truly,4
I am just. Just way too sad. I have never seen this man struggle so bad. He fought till the end but couldn't. Just. No words.,8
NRR ü§òüí™üí™,3
SRH deservedly won. CSK has broken down due to lack of young indian batsmen. They will struggle next few seasons until they build up a good squad but they will be back for sure.,4
Only Dhoni can make a comprehensive loss seem like a nail biting loss,10
If MSD ain't fit why didn't DJ Bravo come in?,3
Lost by just 7 runs . What a close game,4
Commentators still haven't finished jerking off dhoni . Like wtf is this?,8
Shocking from Dhoni. Just let Sam give it a go. Once again only starts swinging when 25+ are required,5
"Dhoni actually did better today than he did in a very long time, kudos to him, but could he have done this if he didn‚Äôt come #5? He should‚Äôve come before Jadhav.",6
"I  love this Samad guy. The last 2 balls, he just threw the balls up slowly.

Clearly saying : Don't care where you hit. I am NOT going to ball a wide or no ball.",8
THiS maTCh iS FiXed,-3
"what's the point of BATDEEP if neither Shardul/Bravo get to bat, that too in a 160 odd total",5
"CSK should forfeit the rest of their matches. Their captain looks sick, they have pissed off 2 senior players and the rest of the squad looks shell shocked.",4
[deleted],1
Dhoni's becoming a joke. He should just retire gracefully at this point.,8
"I‚Äôm not even mad, at least we showed some fight",2
Ahhhh man,1
Why does the cameraman keep showing that girl in the srh shirt,3
"Once again CSK manage to make a 7 run loss look like a 100 run loss. Batting is terrible but honestly, if not for those once an innings 20-30 run overs we'd have won.",6
Sam would've scored 23 off 6,3
[deleted],5
"If bhuvi is out, srh is done I'm afraid",6
Dhonis stats look OK but his non-aggression cost csk the match. Sucks to see him like this.,2
"Win/win for both sides , we get the points and CSK keeps the NRR",14
yo also I hope Dhoni gets some form of medical attention,2
"I think Samad is a bit better than a part timer. He tosses the ball up, has a googly and a quicker one.",10
"Sunny G sounds heartbroken. Well, fuck right off Sunny G",6
Hope Bhuvi recovers quickly,5
Age is catching up to Dhoni,5
Samad did smart thing tossing it up to MS.. he knew he wouldn't come down the ground to hit him..,7
There may have been a chance if Curran had played the whole last over,7
Why the commentator SIMPs are still defending Dhoni? No one has balls to atleast be neutral on him,8
"SRH tried their best, but still couldn't make CSK win",9
Gavaskar should shut his trap already,8
"We managed to save the nrr, checkmate r/cricket",10
Dhoni been so bad...,1
It's crazy that the quantum of loss is just 7 runs. They needed 70 odd from 4 overs,6
Dhoni-Jadeja partnership cost CSK the match. Commentators will of course try their best to twist reality.,7
I thought DJ Bravo was a champion? Why didn‚Äôt he come in earlier,1
"RCB ain't got nothing on us, holy shit. Imagine coming this close to losing to a team of uncles",12
Quantum of loss achieved,3
The only surprising thing about this chase is that we got this far in the chase. CSK playing with no strategy while chasing is the theme for this season,8
Another Dhoni masterclass to take care of the NRR,4
"""A fully fit Dhoni would have taken CSK home.""

Yeah, and a fully fit Bhuvi would have killed the match in the 19th over.",99
What will be Dhoni excuse today?,2
"Fuck, won by 7 runs which once looked like long done and dusted. Poor fielding by srh but glad they won",9
First time I saw SRH beat CSK! That wide ball got me worried but gg,5
SunnyG Dhoni came in the seventh over. Stop taking it in so hard you'll throw up,13
commentators still can't stop simping for Dhoni,20
_The last ball goes for 6..._ Is anyone surprised?,10
It didn't look like it but CSK scored 70 runs in last 4 overs. Holy hell.,13
Wow that was  tense it was like all forces wanting csk to win . Dhoni seems Ill  hope it's not covid,8
Srini going the extra mile with the script here.,2
Only in 2020 can CSK lose 3 games in a row (last time was 2010).,3
"Probably the worst match this season, CSK did not have any intent to win this match halfway through and SRH gave get them chances to do so.",4
At least CSK came close here,9
My Boi Dhoni is averaging 91 with strike rate of 136. Sometimes numbers don't tell you everything.,15
"I hope thella has enough match practice now

Hope boobie is good",4
Hope nothing serious for Bhuvi ...else srh might find it difficult in coming games ...,6
Stfu Gavaskar you moron. Go jack off to Dhoni in your own home. Smh people troll Sanju Manju but he is infinitely worse,10
u/WPHero . When are you gonna delete your account?,6
Dhoni‚Äôs final score is not bad either. 47(36). Struggling from the heat. I will take that as a SRH fan.,10
That margin ahouldve been 20+ comfortably. Come the fuck on,11
"I really don't think KP is a good commentator at all. Neither is Slats. KP thinks everything is ""Unbelievable"", regardless of what is happening, and it just comes off sounding weird. Like he has this list of words he feels like he should say so he just pumps them out. Not much going on upstairs it seems.",5
Remember when dhoni dead batted those 2 deliveries from rashid ? Now tell me how valuable they could've been if INTENT was shown,6
Dhoni MOTM for farming strike from Curran,6
Hope boobie gets fit by next match :(,9
Great game gg,3
"YJB made negative contributions in this match. Other than that run out, he had a horrendous day behind the wicket.",11
CSK have now lost 3 of their 4 matches,5
"Something is seriously wrong with Dhoni, and I think Curran and Bravo should come in before Dhoni. I think hes done. Curran hit 2 sixes in 5 balls, more then Dhoni hit in an entire innings.",12
"Marsh, Shankar and now Bhuvi. Things are turning really worse for us.",9
[removed],14
"they're gonna just come back with a win in their next game against us, aren't they...",1
"Happy for Samad though, he must not have even thought of bowling the last over.",7
CSK would have won by 18th over if it wasn't for those 5 watchful dots per over.,5
"Wow! If there was a normal batsman instead of Jadhav, they'd have won.",7
CSK gonna get 11 fair play points today. Probably gonna get 11 every game for the rest of the tournament.,9
"Sammy shouldve come in earlier and had more of the strike imo, he can hit anything for 6",8
Powerplay .....made them lose,3
Sam Curran's six in slow motion - FUCK.THIS.FRANCHISE,23
"Dhoni with 47 of 36 looks good on stats but he killed his team chances.  
For years he has been playing dot balls at crucial stage",12
"MSD played out 12 dots and CSK lost by 7 runs. 

Enough said.",6
Gavaskar talking about a fit dhoni taking team home. That hadn't happened for many years,15
If Sam came out instead of Jadhav lol,10
Csk fans should be happy because that last 6 got them some net run rate,14
"Honestly its good to see youngsters performing well, even though my team was on the losing end.",6
"CSK-kul reet sadaa chali aayi, match jaayi par NRR na jaayi.",9
Sam Curran is literally the 2008-2013 Albie Morkel reincarnated for this franchise and they don't even give him a proper chance to make a game of it,52
How long before people stop selling the fantasy of Dhoni still being a great finisher? Everybody gets old.,21
SunnyG still orgasming on MSD,8
"Sam Curran not out.
Bravo did not bat.",8
"Gavaskar is such a shill, man.",11
Dhoni should have given Scurran the strike in 19th over. He was striking clean. Dhoni is too much of himself running 3 2s in that over.,8
"Telugu commentators bc, atleast talk about winning team and young guys who played well. Stop sucking dhoni, he can't listen or understand you.",21
NRR tho üò≥üëå,16
Garg and Abishek absolute madlads. You won this,12
"Wtf Dhoni ü§£ it's like he's actively trying to ensure CSK loses

Edit: a lot of die hard Dhoni fans today, understandable",-7
Sam curran needs to be given more importance in the batting. Let him play the long innings.,14
Dhoni looks broken today,11
"**CSK Losing 3 or 3+ Consecutive matches in IPL**

2008 (DC, RR, DEC)

2010 (KXIP, RCB, MI, RR)

2014 (RCB, KKR, SRH)

**2020 (RR, DC, SRH)**",13
Honestly this doesn't feel like a win. Anyone else?,12
CSK could have won this if Curran had faced a few more balls,16
Dhoni has actually done well  in hindsight,8
"So, how do you explain being 5 down and still losing a chase of 165? Really shows that the ultra defensive middle overs were a bit of a overreaction",6
"I was gonna post SRH's official licensed comment ""Stealing loss from the Jaws of victory"" glad they proved me wrong.",8
"This was pretty perfect for SRH, their young middle order stepped up and held the nerve for the final over.",9
"Dhoni should change his tactics for sure in run chases, his body isn't what it used to be",12
"Feel like cricket is such an evolving sport. This tactic to taking it late and digging through your composure is rather mundane since the game has just moved past that. Everyone preps for it - bowlers know exactly how much more effort is needed during those death overs, the team going first also has mental targets keeping in mind the acceleration for the opposition team",11
How many times are these commentators going to keep on mentioning youngsters every game. We get it india has the worlds best youngsters,18
"CSK need 165.

Manage to make it 95 of 36.

Dhoni takes it to wire.

Trademark 25+ off final over.

Bowler messes up at start and it begins.

Out of reach but 6 in the last ball reducing quantum of loss.

r/cricket rage.

Yup. Things are back to normal boys.",27
Must say Dhoni is extremely satisfying and enjoyable when he is not on your team.,16
Great win for SRH but I hope Dhoni is okay. Somehow he looks very tired and unwell.,8
"**CSK against SRH In IPL**

W W W L W L W W W W L W L*",8
Another day it is clear that Dhoni can't target quality bowlers when it is required. Also the dots he play at death over doesn't help,6
They need to drop jadhav and swap bravo for tahir,2
Jadhav 3(10) the real MVP here in a match lost by 7 runs,11
Why was Bravo and Sam not sent in early. Jadhav and Jadeja really?,4
This is what happens when Dhoni comes ahead of Curran and Jadeja,7
When will commentators stop fapping for Dhoni?,12
should have let Jadeja or curran come at 4  instead of Jadhav,3
"Prolly in hindsight and despite the fact that Jaddu got a fifty,sending Curran ahead of Jadeja would have done it for CSK on current hitting form",7
"Easy to put blame on Dhoni again but honestly, the whole CSK team is in a dire need of an overhaul",17
Unsurprising bullshit in this thread.,12
I am sorry dhoni for speaking shit about you,6
"I'm not gonna blame dhoni this time, he tried the whole blame has to go on the openers, you score 10 runs in the first 4 overs and then expect people to hit 30 in the last",11
Toxic fanbois ready with the tHaLa Excuses ! lol,9
Csk should do Narine with Sam Curran,7
Khaleel did well all things considered,7
[deleted],10
[removed],15
"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain - For the first time in my life I am seeing this quote unravel in real life.",10
Was supporting SRH but I‚Äôm annoyed af that this will enable commentators to keep sucking Dhoni‚Äôs dick for the rest of the season,13
I will take Delhi attempting to take on Rashid over this. Thank you!,6
"Doesnt feel like a win , sad to see msd like this. Hope boobie comes back on sunday",14
[removed],4
"Lol everyone bashing Dhoni now, just look at what the top 4 achieved lmao",3
can anyone tell me why anyone brings this jadhav fucker near their teams?,2
Honestly why is Jadhav there,5
Was that intent to win the match or keep the NRR floated? Nevertheless failed at both,4
"All said and done, I hope Dhoni is okay, he really was showing symptoms of Covid. I know how unlikely it is given the security of the bubble, but still. Hope he's well.

Edit: Yikes, he also just spoke about having an itchy throat.",2
Dhoni should be game changer of the match for hogging strike to ensure CSK lose.,16
Why is Jadhav even in UAE. Send his tiny ass back home,12
Looks like we are the meme of this season,8
I feel for Dhenier. This looked like a match he wanted to win by himself and just couldn't catch up with his own age at the end.,20
How does CSK stay at the the top of the fairplay award lmao. Dhoni claimed the most obvious grounded catch earlier and today the blatant gamesmanship by calling the physio,22
Crucify me but I think we could've won the last three games. Fuck this. I'm out....See you chodes next game.,17
"Just for perspective, CSK lost while chasing 160 odd with only 5 wickets down with Curran only facing 8 balls and Bravo not even batting",34
If only one of the top 4 had scored 10 runs more this match actually could have been won by csk. That is unbelievable considering where csk was at 16 overs or at 18 overs.,6
Dhoni is going to receive lot of flak. But this was clearly on the openers.,10
Things could've been different had Jadeja not gotten out,-4
Dhoni's post match interviews are the most interesting part about this CSK side.,26
"jadhav can't bowl can't bat looks like shit,why does he still exist?",17
"I still have yet to see good death bowling in this tournament

Edit: except for SRH vs DC",14
"coming this far with that top order is just a dream. With no strategy on how to chase, idk what they were trying to do in the middle overs",9
CSK losing to 3 youngsters today shows what their team needs,41
"Same Dhoni dropped Gambhir, Sehwag, yuvi etc. for poor batting skills.",31
DHONI JUST ADMITTED THAT THAT WAS TIME WASTING STRATEGY OMG,24
Never thought I would see CSK last in the points table,21
"This sub really has a hate boner for dhoni and its embarrassing and sad. The entire top order failed miserably, jadeja had a nearly identical innings to dhoni.",16
Hope Dhoni and Bhuvi are OK. The injury to Bhuvi added some drama to the game but did not change the result.,32
"Six out of six matches played here were won by teams batting first. But nah, fuck Dhoni after the top 4 dropped like dead birds. Cancer.",27
"I'm not mad about Dhoni, I'm not mad about Jadeja. It is NOT their faults for this loss. You know who we have to blame? Everyone else who DIDNT perform. Dhoni tried, he played well.",14
"Lmao, just realised that Jadhav played. The man's stealing a living.",31
"So Dhoni paid Bhuvi, paid Bairstow, but then Warner at the last second paid Dhoni instead to take back the match I guess.",23
What is the point of this bat deep if you leave 78 needed in 4 overs with 6 wickets in hand? üòÇüòÇüòÇ,32
Should've promoted Curran up the order,31
Well at least he was trying today. But seriously how does csk always find themselves batting at 48 around 11th over?,29
Career ending innings for Jadhav?,21
"People here worried abt Covid lmao he's an old man running twos every delivery in that sweltering heat. He should really Stop, his fitness is horrible rn",33
"MS has done incredible things in his career and understandably u don't wanna count him out, but for crying out lot there are other players playing too, they aren't the antagonists of MSD movie. Just a lil bit of impartiality. But ofc what is impartiality is subjective.",23
Does Dhoni have COVID or something? What was happening to him there?,20
"Amidst the win, SRH and Warner got away with having Samad bowl the last over.",13
Hope MS gets a covid test,19
How many points are required to qualify?,6
Idk his interviews give Homelander ish vibes,14
"Dhoni is one of my fav ever players, and I still root for him to do well. But what makes him think that he‚Äôs not good enough for international cricket but good enough for IPL?",1
'Nobody wants to drop catches'- nice shout-out to Kamran Akmal by Dhoni,24
With Rashid it almost becomes a 16 over chase for any team,23
The low margin is more about srh leaking than csk scoring,32
Khaleel and Shardul are having a chat about who is the better death bowler.,21

Wouldn't be surprised if we hear a player getting infected in a few days and they shut down the ipl and start fresh next year

*removes tinfoil hat*",32
I don't care about going down. Atleast do it by giving a shit,-1
Customary candid shots,3
"Drop Jadhav and Watson both, for fuck's sake",5
"Okay Dhoni did show intent today, and clearly he is way past his prime. Fine, he tried. But why did he keep denying Curran the strike? I've seen prime Dhoni do that, confident that he's the best person to pull it off, rn it's just painful to watch...",6
Dhoni was struggling to breathe there. Hope he doesn't have Covid,16
"I don't know if it's me, but it's poor quality cricket all around this season. Catches dropped at crucial times by both the sides, subpar fielding and poor execution of bowling plan. There has been a lots of fitness issues as well especially among the seniors. A lot of people would be invested in the game because it goes to last over. But really, it's mostly down to one side capitalising on other's mistakes rather than their own merit. This season has been in my memory the worst IPL season.",7
CSK supporters and anti-dhoni people can't accept that CSK are just not a good team in this year's IPL. This is definitely not on Dhoni. The top order scored fuck all in the powerplay and lost 3 wickets.,38
"Itchy throat, cough, shortness of breath, feverish (physio checked his forehead for temperature)... fuck.",40

"Ffs Dhoni throwing Thakur under the bus

OWN YOUR FUCKING MISTAKES GODDAMMIT

Edit: def an overreaction in introspection lol",6
Why are the teams interacting with each other after the game. What's the point of bio bubbles.,8
Teams deserve nothing but loss for playing Kedar Jadhav.,11
"Dhoni would probably relate to Eminem's ""Walk on Water"". (Not comparing MS and Eminem at all, just so the dumb fucks don't turn this around)",16
He is still out of breath.,13
"Yeah absolutely, MS struggled but literally nobody else showed up. Faf getting out at the WORST point, Kedar continues to scam the franchise, and still waiting for Watson's ""innings""

And let's not begin on how they crumbled from such a good position with the ball, getting Warner and Kanos out back to back",20
Man of the match?,5
"After being 44/4(10), I will take this. FUCKING BOOT JADHAV, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE PISSED AT A FUCKING PLAYER BEFORE. HE DESERVES ALL THE ABUSE sitting on his FAT ASS with a 8 crore contract.",14
Another fantastic performance from dhoni according to dhoni worshippers.,16
[deleted],15
Jaddu + MSD together combined played out 24 dots. FFS that's 4 overs gone right there.,13
I mean you can not just keep Watson to flop in 14 + 2 games and hit runs in Finals..,12
"People think Pant got a ton of chances, Jadhav has just cruised under the radar for a while with literally being shit in batting, bowling and fielding",31
"Credit to dhoni to battle it out by coming in early.

Csk need other players to stand up and it's about time they buy young players and give them game time.

 Because dad army are now senior citizens.",21
"CSK should be docked fairness points for that ""rest"" they took there though. Dhoni wasn't injured so that isn't an injury break is it",23
"Being forced to bowl Samad worked in Hyderabad's favour, given that a spent Dhoni couldn't generate power to hit the slower bowling",16
How the fuck did Dhoni end up with 131 SR? This guy I swear,18
Surprised at Rashid Khan's accent,15
"A lot of talk about dropped catches but how about the number of dots faced by Watson, Jadhav, MS etc. those singles could probably have changed the game for us",16
"Boi, CSK really loves to abide by the ABCD mantra: 

*Always*   
*Before*   
*Curran,*  
*Dhoni*

"What was the logic of stacking the side with so many batsmen when Bravo didn't even get to bat ?

 Should have gone for it earlier",10
Slater is so coked that he asked Rashid about Samad twice.,14
[removed],4
Seeing Dhoni struggling to breathe made me worried,30
"Dhoni you will die on the field if you keep doing this, good try though",14
"Y‚Äôall really need to see how Watson, Rayudu and Jadhav batted before critiquing Dhoni",22
"Dhoni should retire from IPL after this season. He is done. The CSK should get rid of bulk of the players and start afresh next season. Watson is certainly done and probably even Du Plessis

Bhuvi again injured, hopefully he is fit by the time of the Australian Tour",15
Rashid so wholesome üòä,20
"I feel bad for Dhoni fans who have to overlook his dot balls and decline in hitting ability.  
They are the ones who cheer at Pant's failures",12
I really can't understand the logic of fans hating on Dhoni. The pitch was bad. The bowling was spot on. Guy comes in at 42/4 and took it till the last over. This is a pitch where none of the big guns were able to play. Imo Dhoni did well to bring it in (almost).,29
[deleted],15
"Fuck off r/Cricket, Jadhav's crucial for Paytm Fair Play Points",14
"If Dhoni gets covid whole thing gets shut down. Csk playoff streak will not be broken. IF WE CANT WIN NO ONE CAN, BITCHES!",16
DAE think Bhuvi would not have walked off had the match been any closer?,2
CSK did well to reach 157 though. Didn't think they would get anywhere near 164.,-1
"Damn Rashid speaks English so well, did he always talk well I havent seen too many of his interviews?",16
"Open with Curran and ask him to take the score to 50 in the powerplay man, if Narine can open then surely Curran can too and it's not like CSK have the best openers that can't be dropped.",11
I would rather have MSD scoring at a strike rate of 120-130 than him getting out in single digits. Csk doesn't have anyone good after him who can carry the innings.,15
"Sam Curran should be opening the batting for CSK. Considerable amount of potential and would offer so much more balance to that batting order. Watto's been wasteful as well.

Faf
Curran
Rayudu
Jadhav
Dhoni
Jad
Bravo
Santner

..is much, much better, imo.",11
Who else can keep in CSK squad?,8
"Quick, let's find other guys who failed to deflect blame from Dhenier.",9

Dhoni tried his best but people still gonna troll him on Social Media.,-14
Ahh RR at 5. Things are restored in order,3
Lmao great logic here dhoni gives strike to faf against RR dhoni shit doesnt take responsibility. When he takes strike himself playing 50 dhoni shit again.,0
"Once dhoni was in csk were never in the game. Again taking the game to the last over, again hitting in the last over and again walking away with an unchanged strike rate and average, and again without the match. This time the fans have an added argument of dhoni not feeling well still playing. Great job by SRH.",4
This lady on Star gets paid for literally just standing there. Dream job indeed.,13
CSK really has a paper thin and worn out sqaud this season and needs a complete revamp in the next season. 95% of the current players need to go.,7
"10 matches to go, 8 need to qualify. Think we can do it?",3
CSK is basically the geriatric team. SRH proved why young blood is better than a 40 year old man,10
"Interviewer to KP: Any plans for the weekend KP?

KP: Just put it in the HOLE.",38
"So Kohli gets shit on when he picks Umesh Yadav and Siraj, but when it comes to CSK, it's not the captain's fault for picking Jadhav and not promoting Curran? 

Nobody is shitting on Dhoni's batting, it was okay, not great, he would certainly have done better with some help from the other batsmen but what about his captaincy decisions? Picked Vijay for 3 games, Jadhav for 4 games and has now thrice promoted Jadeja ahead of Curran despite Curran being 100000 times the better hitter. 

We're not supposed to hold him responsible for that? Weren't you all giving him credit for persisting with Watson last season? Same goes here - it's his team, he is the captain. He can make strong decisions but he chooses not to. He is accountable, no space for sympathy points here.",37
[deleted],22
I don't think Scurran has a good batting technique for top order. I have seen him getting out bowled or caught out in the inner circle a lot. He's a pinch hitter. Don't know why some people want him to open the batting ffs.,7
"Good to see us win a game without much of the credit going to Warner, Bairstow or Williamson for once. Looks like we‚Äôve found our XI.",21
Unpopular (?) opinion - Reducing quantum of loss is actually good. If you have a streak of late wins it comes really handy. 29 off last over over is too high but given that the top order failed not much could have been done. Prime Dhoni would have been able to do it but that was his speciality and not the standard we should expect.,7
Wut the f**k happen to pandey fielding,10
"Lol i am anti Dhoni people now.

Note that Curran came in when the match was already lost due to Dhoni tactics. Like he did not even have a chance to influence the game. Fuck off already in defending the man.",16

100 from last 7 in all 3 chases",5
atleast he tried this time,0
People have gone from shitting on Kohli to shitting on Dhoni,9
Gaikwad needs to open. Watson out for the time being and Tahir should come in for Piyush. Get Jagadeesan in for Jadhav I think. Time to give youngsters a chance. CSK  reserves look extremely barebones. Why didn't they replace Raina? DO they even have management in the team?,4
This will probably be the first time CSK won't qualify. The blame is on them imo. They should have known 2018 miracle won't happen again. They should have traded better and younger players.,8
Can we all just start a petition to get suresh raina back?,8
I don't think it would be this close of a game if bhuvi finished his over,15
"We have double header tomorrow. DC v KKR , two very good teams and RR v RCB, SPD v VK. Gonna be awesome üëä",7
"Dhoni dilemma:

1. Come in late and take your time to get settled and by the time you do, it's too late.
2. Come in early, get settled and when you need to hit, you're unfit to hit.

CSK really needs to stop relying on Dhoni and look at the glaringly obvious gaps in their lineup such as Jadhav and Watson. They really need some young guns that stay for a while in the franchise. Sam is a good addition, they need a couple more.",22
Kartik looks like he should be playing the sax in a New York jazz band.,11
"As I said before, CSK need to

- Open with Rayudu

- Play Curran at No.3

- Play Ngidi/Tahir for Watson",5
Csk fans trying so hard to justify Dhoni. Yeah the top order failed but dhoni has been failing for the last few matches. When you come at 9th over you are either supposed to win the game or get out. No point in remaining not out and denying bravo and curran a chance win the game,11
Open with Curran and Faf. Unkills can come and play tuk tuk later.,12
Csk will manage to qualify somehow.,6
"At least CSK didn‚Äôt fall too behind in NRR after this match, mission accomplished",16
"Like it or not but Dhoni's 24(27) till the 18th over didn't do CSK any favours. Taking nothing away from the commitment MS showed, though.",20
"Thankfully SRH won, or Garg would have soon gotten a call from the New Zealand mafia",16
Priyam Garg's account going stonks,18
With srh's middle order performing Warner and bairstow can play more freely. But they badly need bhuvi to be okay,12
I need something to lift my spirits : Pls RCB bowl Siraj tomorrow,17
So BCCI finally figured out cloning humans ! Priyam Garg is Jadejas clone of course..,7
"I hope a day comes when these commentators and experts stop orgasming over Thala, Super V and Rohit and talk more on contributions of other players.",23

"Warner really needs to get rid of the moustache, he reminds me of someone I do not want to be reminded about",25
Warner's moustache is a crime against humanity,36
"The fascinating thing is that no matter what Dhoni does, people are divided with their opinions of him.

The reality is that he somehow managed an unbeaten 47 while no one else bar Jadeja did shit. However, it never really looked like CSK were going to win imo. Is that Dhoni's fault? I personally think this shit is happening often enough that Dhoni is not helping anymore. He seems to only really go after the bowling when the game is pretty much dead. He was 24 off 27 at one point as the NRR kept escalating. Not sure what to say, good to see that he scored runs again, but man - it just wasn't looking like what the team really needed. And this is becoming a trend.",16
This sub is shitty af. Why are everyone here blaming only dhoni when the whole team performed badly?,19
I am enjoying every moment of CSK being bottom of the league. They have been an annoying little team for a bit too long.,39
"10 more matches to go! Min 6 needed to win for qualification! It's good to see Dhoni showing some intent in batting after the debacles of the previous games! Spending time in the middle will surely help! 

I guess time's up for Watson and Jadhav! 

It will take a miracle to qualify! Even more to reach the finals but I sure hope we get that!",10
"Passing responsibility to non striker's end, while keep dotting balls. Continue the process till last over and try last ball six to make a statement that ""you tried""

Endless cycle.",44
Kohli has escaped with his image,11
Karthik didn't ask Warner about bhuvi. What's up with that?,14
i come here for Dhoni jokes,27
Why is there a power player of the match AND a man of the match??,9
"Hazlewood, Tahir, Sam and Faf should be guaranteed picks for each match. They're your match turners. Kick Watson out from opening and give one of the young guys a proper chance. Ruturaj looked so scared in the two times he came out to bat like his entire life depended on it which is why he made bad calls. Give some of the youngsters some backing, you may not win this season but you'll set yourself up for the future.",19
"I've said this before and I'm saying this again, CSK could very well finish outside top 4 for the first time in IPL history",16
"CSK gonna end at last position, with the highest NRR",57
"Dhoni team mates really let him down again, great captaincy and batting only to be ruined by consecutive dropped catches and middle order failures by Rayudu and Jadhav. Cant ask much more from such a living legend",-46
No Dhoni in presentation?,8
Dhoni's a laughing stock on twitter,20
Garg boy has a great smile. Give him Colgate shining star award already,21
"Overs 7 to 10. Ten runs

Granted they had just lost 2 wickets but just taking singles then would've taken them over the line.",10
Watson needs to hold a golf club instead of a cricket bat,14
"Instead of taking Doubles in the last few overs Dhoni could have given strike to Curran who could've actually brought the team closer to target more rapidly. And if Curran had failed, he could've gone back to his tuk tuk.

Like always, he wanted to portray himself as the ""last man standing"" over there while shunning others",30
Dhoni looked sick today,6
Fuck this shit. Let's meet for RR v/s RCB tomorrow and see some entertainment,47
"Momentum did shift after srh batting in death overs.  
But csk start at 6 rpo in first 8 overs and then dhoni waits too long to go for shorts. Have watched it so many times.",12
The 671st time Gavaskar has referred to him as Abhisek Verma,25

3D 3D",5
"In all the chase, dhoni perfomance has been consistent. He start with lot of dot balls and then reqd rate is 18, manages to be not out with a good strike rate.Still people feel to defend him.",38
Never thought I would see CSK struggle in IPL. Never,36
"Dhoni's innings build up is pretty evident but this year he is way out of touch. At least last year he was hitting the ball well in the death. 

I think he will need 2-3 more matches like this to get in touch. Might be game over for CSK by then.",21
we live and die with dhoni so be it.,1
KP's thing that he is not buying into that nonsense and T20 can bite you hard and you may end up losing 5 games in a row is fuckin coming out to be true!!,14

"DC a Top 2 team so far, and CSK bottom 2. What a timeline",22
They pulled up a stat that said that the last time csk lost 3 in a row was back in 2014 and surprise surprise they finished 3rd that year. One can't underestimate this team no matter how shit they appear to be.,20
"The six crores spent on Jadhav, and two crores spent on Vijay could have been SPLURGED on Raina's balcony, and still CSK would've been better off /s",45
DC is in top 4 and CSK is in bottom 4. 2020 sure is a strange year. Anything can happen in it.,15

Had Dhenier not been so badly fatigued, no way Samad with the kind of balls he bowled in the last over, would've been able to defend the total. So who goes out to accommodate 3D? Abhishek? He's an allrounder that provides left arm spin option. Samad? The only finisher we've and also an allrounder. Priyam? That's the only viable option to me.",10
