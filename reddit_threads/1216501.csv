"Let's face it...IPL peaked pretty hard last night and it's all going to be downhill from here onwards. We witnessed a true once in a few seasons epic moment and it's going to be hard to top last night. 

But I feel privileged to have witnessed it and I'm just glad I fell in love with this game. Thank you for existing IPL.

In conclusion, go team go sports!!!",28

"I almost forgot that sport is a pretty human game, last game reminded me of that so much. I'll probably never mention players to retire out again lmao. If we share along with the wins of players it's only fair we tolerate when they fail. It's not purely numbers. 

From the Monga article: 

>This is where the philosophical essence of sport comes into question. I once goaded Stephen Fleming to say retiring-out people should be normalised. He wouldn't have any of it. I gave him the example of Yuvraj in the 2014 final. ""That's the beauty of it, isn't it? Not let someone get away with it just because they can tap out. 'Not my day today, I am out.'""

>Fleming has played a lot of international cricket and now coaches a successful T20 franchise. To him, the philosophy was clear: you do not give up the struggle.",7
The entire RCB needs to pull off a Tewatia today,73

"Sanju Samson spoke well in post-match presentation yesterday:

> I have been hitting well from the last on year. I have been in the right frame of mind. Don't see a change in my game. First of all I was fed up with myself. I was trying hard but things were not happening. Then I worked hard. I asked myself what do I need to achieve? I told myself I have 10 years of this wonderful game in me, and I have to give everything to these 10 years. My family is supportive of that. The power comes from genes. My father is a very powerful man.",4

Rohit and Kohli are so susceptible to leggies while Ranji guns regularly massacre them. Shows the importance of Domestic Cricket™ in maintaining a player's skills,3

Don't care who wins.. please sit Umesh out today and swap out Styen (can't watch the legend get trashed) with Zampa,3

"At the toss, Kohli said we bowled well the last 4 overs of the last game. Did I hear it wrong? Because here are last 4 overs against Punjab:

17th - 14 runs

18th - 11 runs

19th - 26 runs

20th - 23 runs",10
"We can clearly sense something is wrong between Rohit and Kohli, when did it all start ?",2
Aren't zampa and chahal the same type of bowler? Maybe sunder will bowl his full quota today and zampa will not. OR zampa is brought specially for rohit and suryakumar,2
"Wtf is this from Rcb

If Ab wud keep, why not from the first game

Just wasted a overseas slot for 2 games lol",3
"Eager to see how Zampa plays tonight. I know it’s just been two games but if multiple Indian and overseas spinners perform better than Rashid, his spot needs reconsideration. Given the price he was paid and the people he’s keeping out of the team, he needs to perform head and shoulders above the other spinners.",2
Idk RCB team today kinda look sus,0
Give the bowl to Washington Sundar and don't be a coward Kohli.,1
"Hope we get to see Shivam Dube defending 36 off the last over against Pandya tonight, will be exciting",3
Nice! RCB is playing 8 bowlers today.,5
"I met Rohit Sharma at a restaurant once - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?” Then out of nowhere Rohit shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I (being a big IPL fan) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” Rohit was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Rohit and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.",21
"Kohli to Rohit at toss: play whoever you want mon, ain't gonna make a difference.",5
Wtf abD is keeping the wickets today?,6
"My god, MI's fast bowling line up is something else. Bumrah, Boult and Pattinson in the same team.",10
Umesh and Steyn not playing means RCB will concede 20 fewer runs,4
Would be smart to use all 8 Chahal and Zampa overs before Pollard and Hardik come out to bat. MI’s openers are a bit vulnerable to spin early but the middle order can take them to the cleaners.,3
Y'all Adam Zampa or Sam Curran who's the cuter twink?,4
"3 changes for RCB after their first loss. I'm shocked, I tell you. Shocked.",11
OK irrelevant question: have any of you guys met Indians in real life who support Australia over India. I haven't but I have come across quite a few on social media. It is their choice but I find it pretty weird,5
I told you guys AB is going to keep in this season,3
Hope playing against Mi brings back Kohli’s form.,1
Not feeling good about ABD keeping today.,4
I've got lube.,8
I cannot digest the fact that they dropped Dale Steyn. He had his chances against kxip but vk dropped important catches !,5
"Why do all captains choose to bowl first? Almost all matches are won by the team batting first. 

Ishan kishan is finally in the team. Looking forward to seeing him",1
Is udana good?,3
MI matches have the worst crowd noise,4
RCB needs at least 9 extra batsmen.,6
"don’t know what to say, but Udana received cap from Siraj 😭😭😭😭",19
"> Saurabh Tiwary isn't fit

That was not unexpected",110
"Really strange selctions

Mi going with 3 out n out quicks

N Rcb going with just 1 n 3 spinners n 2 medium pace. 

One team seems to have read the pitch horribly wrong.",7
Our boy Udana is playing. Man I'm excited.,7
I dearly hope RCB win this match. Don't want play off spots to be decided until the last week.,5
Why isn’t Morris playing?,4
"I'm sure that's what Udana dreamed as a kid. Receiving RCB cap from Mohammed Siraj,",106
"Come on r/cricket who should be my dream11 captain

Rohit or AB?",3
ABD IS LITERALLY CARRYING THIS TEAM ON HIS BACK. HOPE HE WONT HURT HIS BACK.,4
"I was thinking if Umesh can pull off tewatia today , but Umesh did not get selected at all",2
"Bowling looks little better now without Umesh. If Gurkeerat fires we can straight swap Morris for Udana when he is fit.

And we are not wasting overseas slot anymore.",3
The only srilankan in the IPL gets a game hope he does well.,7
Surely Udana isn't that great? To be called a T20 specialist? What have I been missing?,1
"It’s time for Moran finch has to step up, he has been shit in IPL since forever.",2
No Philippe means it's straight to bed after Finchy gets out tonight I think. Don't make me go to bed too early please Finchy,3
Why do I remember Udana taking a hattrick in CLT20 in South Africa,3
No Lord Umesh....yes!,3
"No matter no matter no matter how many changes you make, the titles will always be zero",4
I feel like RCB have a good chance of winning. They can bat without pressure and put a good score. Chahal and Zampa can also bowl better defending a total.,6
"3rd team to choose to field this season, it's 50-50 right now !! Even the RR win was not one-sided

MI must be sure of their chasing capabilities, big ground Dubai...160 should be ideal.",3
AB is keeping? Thats interesting,2
Make more than 70 runs today Brohit and I promise I will never make a Vadapav joke.,4
Why is matchbot supporting RCB?,2
I think we will lose,3
RCB is a team that hasn't won an IPL yet and has the luxury to be called a heavyweight by the commentators.,10
"Hi I’m RCBian , and I’m ready to get hurt again",3
I've come to realise picking RCB's bowling line up is like starting an essay. You can try your hardest but at the end of the day you still won't even have a title.,2
"Between last year's IPL and now, Ishan Kishan was moonlighting as a drug dealing pimp in the streets of Mumbai.  At least, he styles himself like he did.",1
"So, only Saini is a pure fast bowler in RCB’s lineup?",3
AB is keeping again. I hope that this means that we will get to see Kohli bowl as well.,13
Mumbai to win today I think.,1
MI will miss a quickfire 50 from Umesh for sure,5
Daily Mark Nicolas appreciation comment ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ,9
Sometimes it makes me laugh realizing I am supporting an alcohol advertisement and it depresses me when they don't win,10
this week on 'new version of rcb's bowling is shit excuses',2
"A win against MI will be a great confidence boost after the hammering in the last game. And it will be nice to reverse the recent trend, while the overall H2H record between us and Mumbai is not so bad, they have won 7 of the last 8 encounters.",4
Anyone think Gurkeerat Singh is overrated? He is talked up as a power hitter but doesn't actually justify this position at all.,-1
Everyone asking why is matchbot? No one asking how is matchbot? Matchbot how are you?,20
Tiwary isnt batting? I am supporting rcb then..,7
bAlaNce,1
Virat should only ball when they need 40 from the last 2,3
What happened to krunal in that pic looks horrific,4
It's either Bangar or Sunny G commentary. I choose Bangar,3
"By the end of this season I think there would only be 2 teams left without the title. 

Out of these 2 teams does anyone wants to guess the other one?",1
"Guys, is it just me or do you think Rift^TM was created by the internet. I mean, to think we thought there was something wrong when there really wasn't isn't like us, right?",2
everyone knows better than to shit on a struggling player thanks to tewatia,6
"Tiwary is injured, what he missed a meal",2
Is our success proportional to Mallya's success in life?,8
Y not moen ali ?,4

Man when finch starts middling them watch out,9
Finchy has probably lost 12 runs from hitting the ball a metre short of a 6,8
if Pollard sprinted he might have made it,4

Kohli can't play in empty stadium.. Tsk tsk,11
someone is downvoting all the comments against RCB,2

Rookie mistake.",11
These last 3 overs have completely changed the game wtf,4
"Strike rate of 27.27

  


Balanced like all things should be",5
We payed 2cr extra to retain Kohli at the cost of releasing KL Rahul. One of the worst decisions by RCB ever.,7
This is the end of Kohli. The downfall has begun,2

Kohli is worrying a bit now. He always used to make a big comeback the next match.,9
R Chahar has impressed before and has impressed again.,11
Is this Anushka's fault?,3
Kohli forgot that he is not in the same team as Rohit and this is not a practice session.,8

Once Kohli was 2X the player as Dhoni but no one cared. So he realized he has to play shitty and let the fans justify it for his popularity to grow.,4
"r/cricket has already decided that a 30 year-old averaging 50 in all formats is an over-rated hack that's past his prime and needs to be retired, never change.",51
Time to make Finch the captain of RCB,1
What is the use of boasting about fitness if you can't bat properly which is your main job?,-5
Most annoying thing now is watching 17 different Kohli ads for the rest of the innings.,100
Guess Anushka gonna trend on twitter today as well,4
Tuned in just in time to watch Kohli fail again👌,1
these jokers will make 150 only,0
That ball to Kohli seemed easier than the one Anushka bowled to him,1

RCB should get Moeen for Kohli in next match somehow.  Moeen>>>>>Kohli.,11
Kohli hasn't scored a boundary yet in this Ipl,12
Everything rests on ABDs shouders now. He bats deep RCB get 160-170. Otherwise they will be skittled for 150.,4
No celebration from Rohit after virat's wicket bromancing is real haters,11
Quick! Kick every member of RCB in the balls!,6
We'll just have 4 overs from our Frontline pacers after this over. ABD will have to be dismissed soon,9

"Brian Lara coaching Sanjay Banger how to coach and how to bat.

Having listened to Banger this year, it's clear why our batsmen's thinking becomes so muddled",3

when ab is batting batting looks very easy.,1
Kohli does not to play longer for him to be on our televisions.,2
Virat had as much pressure as R. Chahar's short pony.,7
ABD is such a joy to watch. I don't remember if there was ever a time he was out of form. So much finesse and ease the way he times the ball.. lovely.,8
I predict Rohit /  Rahul to replace Kohli as captain in ODI / T20 and Finch to replace him as captain in RCB... you heard it first here boys!,3
Kohli hasn't crossed 25 runs in his last 8 IPL innings.,12
"We move closer and closer to my fantasy, Kohli the test match specialist. Can't wait.",1
Fun fact: RCB is going to win the IPL and yall can do nothing about it.,4
Thing was with too many cameras following In RCB & other teams dressing room. Kohli was in pressure. When he loses for india. After Post match interviews it's done. Practice and bounce back. These Inside RCB and Build up to matches are distracting. Mind you if Kohli fails throughout IPL I am still backing him to make 100s in Aus tour and you know it too.,3
This is the true RCB that we all love,4
"Can't expect more than 150-160 now, one would assume",3

"The Kock is due a score, might be this game.",3
"Padikkal bby what you doin

Edit: thats better",2
Kohli has to open. Needs to get his eye in in the powerplay so that he is set when it ends and picking the gaps/manipulating the field is crucial.,2
RCB slowed down so much,3
Now padikkal under pressure.,1
"Kohli has been completely out of sorts. What do you think are the reasons:

* Lack of match practice

* Lack of crowd

* Home sickness (his wife is pregnant, it's got to be difficult to be away for such a long period)",9

You beauty,2
Bloody hell,3
"This is clearly a coaching problem. The Hesson-Katich combo clearly isn't working. Virat thrives in a Shastri like environment and consequently his team. We can't get Shastri to be coach since that would be a conflict.

One of the guys I would be looking at keenly if I were RCB management is Sanjay Manjrekar. He is strategically and tactically sound. It is a joy to listen to him on cricInfo along with Ian Bishop. He knows the domestic circuit well too so can help with scouting. His cricInfo articles are a must read for any cricket connoisseur. Has quite innovative ideas as well.

Next season is best chance to hire him since he has been relieved of commentator duties",10

Love me some AB knocks,3
Nicely placed,2
Ooo its ABD vs sophisticated Pandya,1
zampa and chahal will be tough here. there's enough turn on the pitch.,4
Kohli shouldn't come to Australia later this year imo.,3
They went 5 overs without a boundary? That's just bad T20,2
"I thought AB hit those.

This padikkal dude is good eh?",3
ABD plays that very well beautiful to watch.,2
Devdutt would rather play safe and hit the bad balls than let rcb’s poor middle order come out,1
Can someone explain y ab retired?,1
Abd being krunal's bunny is hoax,1
Ab is a true freak . He is 36 and can still score so rapidly effortlessly!,6
Unadkat is doing more justice for the money paid to him than Kohli,3

If you're not watching Dugout you are missing out,5
"To me Devilliers is the best ""finder of gaps"" since Tendulkar..",19

If ABD is around till the 20th we'll be chasing atleast 190,13
How's AB in such a form without playing any sort of cricket,17
Kohli from his body language appears to me like he is in lots of pressure and going through depression.,22
"Tewatia proved that no matter how bad you start your innings, you are always 2-3 hits away from making it up.",11
Lee has a great sense of humor,1
RCB needs to inflate the par score by 30% to compensate for our shite bowling,6
"Padikkal is good, better organized than Shaw.",10
ABDV is t20 GOAT,3
This is really good from padikkal,4
"Dugout still avoiding talking about Kohli's slump and instead giving some weird logic about Padikkal not striking. Just accept that he is out of form. Knowing Kohli, he will come back stronger soon. No reason for him not to do it as lesser players than him found a way out of slump.",10
Padikkal has pulled Bumrah for a boundary and smashed Pattinson for back to back sixes. Brilliant  batting!!!,10
Krunal looks like a perfect Bollywood villain.,5

"Just tuned in..

Ye kohli ko kya ho gya hai ?",5
What is Kohli's role in RCB? He has the highest catch drops. He isn't a smart captain. He is not lucky to win tosses. Now it looks like he has not crossed 25 with the bat for the last 8+ innings.,13
Why is Hardik not bowling?,2
Somebody pull the plug on  **RCB** chant.,6
Paddikal can be a great LOI batmen. Perfect replacement for Dhawan.,3
"Can't believe we're now diagnosing Kohli with depression based on his body language, Jesus Christ.",6
ABDV that good he retired from internationals cause he was bored of how easy it was,1
"*a young left hander bats well*

Cricket analysts: Is *$insert name here$* the next Brian Lara?",8
Mark Nicholas addressing the youngsters just like Cricket '07 commentary.. some things never change,3
Krunal has got ABD out nearly every innings he's faced him iirc. Scary.,5
"South Africa, please let ABD back into your squad for the t20 world cup",1
Only Indian Left hander who looked who belonged at this level so early at his career was Ganguly,2
"Paddikal is a boon to my fantasy team. A guy who costs 6.5 cr, opens, and is a guaranteed starter now. Makes runs and gives me the budget to get other great players who are super expensive.",3
"Seeing kohli perform like this
Feelsbadman.jpg",4
"Friendly reminder, There is a KKR vs RCB match at Sharjah, 300 on the cards lads?",8
I'm so happy they gave padikkal a chance to play. Always knew he was gonna be this good,2
"With Paddikal, kl, Mayank, Manish, karun, gopal, Gowtham, Karnataka has to be the strongest domestic team by a mile",8
"So, what, 50 off the last 5?",-1
"Just like how pascal siakam never picked up a basketball during the NBA shutdown and struggled in the bubble. Similarly kohli didn't practice or pick up his bat during the time off and it's showing.

Hopefully it's just a mental thing and as the tournament progresses he gets his groove back.",3
176 will be the final total.,-1
"AB showing the way, get at least 1 of every ball, and one boundary option an over.",1
"Tough competition between Gill,Padikkal, Shaw and Yashasvi for future Indian opener position",2
The scariest bit is that AB hasn't yet gone super saiyan on anyone this year. Hopefully we aren't his first victim,2
"Kohlis been shit in the last 3 games, dev is filling his shoes pretty well and getting scores kohli would normally get",1
Time to take FULL advantage of Pollard bowling.,2
Pollard in front of ABD wtf are they trying.,1
"Kohli is going to use the baby as an excuse and not tour Australia

when you aren't scoring runs it will be hard for him to sledge back",1
ab to padikkal : watch and learn kid,2
Abd is gonna spank pollard hard,5
Kieron Rajat Bhatia,3
I think Moeen should play in place of Zampa. They already have Chahal and need a good middle order Batsman,1
77 in 5 overs is within reach if these 2 stay for 3-4 overs,2
"Who remembers Kohli's gritty 92* batting through the innings to lose the match vs MI in 2018, a season where the team let him down almost every game and he was fielding out of his skin every match trying to set an example for his teammates who were dropping catches. It feels like something died in him after that season.",17
"I turned stream off earlier, just checked Kohli's score, he is in some really bad form 3(11), 1(5) last match...",3
Pollard slower pace bowling,1
"Ladies and gentlemen, Kieron Pollard!",-2
"Pollard gonna get whacked or take W 
No in between",4
Mumbai have such a good squad though,3
Big man Polly 😮 I guess Rohit has no other option.,3
Please wack Pollard. Nothing more satisfying than seeing a military medium bowler getting torn to shreds.,12
Sexy timing boi,1
"The way Padikkal has accelerated, just like Thala. 

But only one of them does it at the right time.",9
"That stadium is empty, who is chanting RCB? Lol, is it just the team staff?",7
Nico Rosberg: Is Kohli career over ?,3
How slow is that run up.. lmao,2
Padikkal is all quality,2
I have seen better bowling actions in street cricket than pollard lmao,7
How did that go for 4. What placement,4
Really happy for Devdutt Padikkal. I have a feeling this is going to be a great season for him.,5
Maybe Kohli needs crowd as motivation,5
Beautiful placement; mature fifty.,4
Well played young boy!,3
Wish padikkal took some time in the last match.,4
Koach has dropped more catches than no. of boundaries he hit in this IPL,7
how is pollard considered a right arm medium? he's bowling under 110 km/hr.,2
Time for Paddikal to go at every ball :P,4
"came here just to appreciate Devdutt.. a wonderful innings indeed..

hoping we can finish off strongly here..",8
So many local players in great form. Let's hope when they get selected for an England or Australia tour they play well. With kohli like this it'll be hard for him to carry again,7
Padikkal's batting is more sensible,2
Man I want RCB to win just one match with Kohli/ABD failing,1
"With the bowling attack we have, we need 200",6
Guys checkout my name!,-4
What if paddikal gets 100?,2
Another day Another Malayali scores a 50,3
Anything under 10 runs in Pollard's over will be a success for MI,4
Why does everything Padikkal hit looks like it's in slow-mo,16
"If not for the brand value, Rahul Tewatia for 15 Crs would be a far better investment than Virat Kohli in IPL post 2016.",8
Oh the timing.,2
"Padikkal has batted with Finch, Kohli and AB this innings... must be an absolute dream.",122
ABD is going to spank Pollard isn't he,8
"Padikkal looks like such a talent. I love how organised and composed he is at the crease, it's a brilliantly paced innings from an opener too.",11
pollard society uncle bowling.,15
Fuck. He's only 20 too,3
[deleted],9
Mr.360,3
"They keep saying just two down but the horrifying thing is none of Gurkeerat, Dube or Sundar inspire much confidence.",4
Stop obsessing over Kohli. 3 bad innings is nothing. No one keeps a spotlight on other batsmen’s failures,11
"From the recent videos from RCB YouTube channel Kohli was saying he is feeling his best as he felt in 2016. 

Well looks like he is no were near to his form as in 2016. Hope he comes back strong in the next game. We really need him to score runs if we need to win matches.",11

"He is catching up with batch of Shubman gill and all, Bishnoi is doing good too, let's wait for yashaswi",2
"To all the RCB fans, congrats! You won the game bois! And gals!",1
Dicks out for padikkal when he gets to 100,4
Why you even running pollard mah man? Just stand and bowl maybe you'll generate more pace that way,3
"Time for Kohli to be dropped as a captain from T20/ODIs... and please don’t cite his BiLaTeRaL records ...with the team that we have had  (and BCCI infra )India should have won at least 1 ICC title by now . 

In any other country heads would have rolled after that embarrassing defeat in WC.",5
Not gonna lie I missed the first 15 overs and was surprised to open my phone and see a decent score on the board. Last game was just so uncomfortable compared to this,5
"Forget about Pritvi or Shubman, India have there new opening batsman in Padikkal",7
We WaNt PaRtHiV PaTeL. Safe to say he's not going to get a game for sometime.,3
"This looks like a pitch for the spinners. 

Zampstagram might be key today",9
AB DeViIwishyouplayedforusagain,24
RCB lower batting order is a joke.,2
CEAT tyre’s strategic timeout,0
MI are so quick on the over rate,3
"Devdutt Padikkal
Shubhman Gill
Nitish Rana
Sanju Samson

aesthetic line up",12
I have noticed anxious energy in rcb players since 2017 maybe management and captain have something to do with it. They start performing after leaving Rcb.,10
"Let MI start with 50/0, just save us the agony of watching umesh bowl",2
"Mallus and Gelf, name a better love story",6
Pollard is extra slow today..like he has no energy,2
Brohit with the munchies asking for a banana lol,0
"How are we 16 overs in, in only 1hr 15 mins?",9
How good is isuru udana?,5
I think RCB will finish somewhere close to 180.,3
Hesson wishing he didn't quit NZ,7
Just casually scoring at 166.6 without lofting.,7
I think these last 4 overs are gonna be fun,4
Fun fact: Pollard took his first wicket since IPL 2015 in MIs last match!,2
"Production of these matches is outstanding you could never tell these same stadium had bowlers like Musa Khan, Hasan Ali running around few years back 😭😂",0
Download cred baby,2
VK having a 2014 PTSD?,1
Kohli has been dogshit since that disaster class against NZ where he looked like his 2014 self facing southee and jamieson,1
MI is going to lose,-2
"Bc fuck ceat, motherfuckers have wasted hours of my life",10
You'd think the bat weighs just 1 pound the way AB twists his wrists holding the bat.,5
"Feeling bad Kohli, he looks like, he is under lots of pressure. His batting isn't helping either.",5
" 

Who is that sole girl in the RCB support staff?",4
Everybody is talking like it’s gonna be a cakewalk for Mumbai. Completely forgetting Zampstagram is gonna unleash hell on these nosefucks.,13
All Pollard does is just sprays it at leg stump at such a slow pace that the batsman has no choice but to just clip it and take singles. It's just frustrating to watch.,7
Zampa and Chahal are some of the best leggies in the limited format. We will find it difficult to maneuver the middle overs against a pair of such class spinners.,6
Can we squeeze in a cheeky bilateral against Sri Lanka amidst of the IPL? Koach needs to get back in form before the Australian series,18
would BCCI or India's supreme court allow Shastri to coach RCB,4
180 maybe?,2
I don't understand the obsession with foreign coaches. Someone like Padikkal would do even better an Indian coach (think Dravid/Shastri),5
Freak vs freak now. Abd vs Bumrah,15
 In b4 Anushka blames reddit,15
This is so wrong... the feeling of hope is so wrong...,4
Haha the JOSH ad was 😂😂😂😂,0
Hopefully Kohli picked up a few tricks of the trade from Paddikal in their short partnership.,11
"Padikal is a good good talent but sadly he's also top order player. Rohit shikhar rahul mayank gill & Shaw are ahead of him at the moment
India can have a b team of top order batsman as well with the talent we have",5
"Guys I've always wondered how fast are the guys bowling in gully cricket you know the pacers 20-21 year olds.

They felt pretty fast but have no idea what speed do they bowl at ?

Anyone got checked at some arcade their speed?",5
"Memes and jokes aside, if you or someone you know is looking to get WhiteHat Jr., Byjus etc. for kids, don't. It's a huge waste of money.",90
"If padikkal scores a century, Zampa is willing to cheat on stoinis with him!",9
[deleted],-1
"3 from 11? if RCB want to make the playoffs, they can't allow room for such performances. Drop him",2
"kohli got comfortable with that AC,hence hes running back to the dressing room.",4
Bumrah to get abd this over.,-1
ABD v Bumrah ....Hell yeah!,6
ABD has never been intimidated by Bumrah. I just hope we get a quiet over here,5
RCB players look like bottles of RC in that dress,2
If Mumbai could they would put an ad on Rohit’s face.,2
MI at the top of fair play ??,1
"Next match of RCB is against RR. Kohli need to target Curan, Rajpoot but be aware of Gopal.",2
"Bumrah is my fantasy vice captain, need him to knock over alteast 2 players, CMON BUMRAH",1
"the way things are going, will consider this a win if we restrict them under 185.",5
"Holy fuck, here we go. Strap in boys.",4
Bumrah yorkers pls,1
Oooh that's top class,5
Y God that whitehatjr ad should be removed. Teaching coding for nursery kids next?,15
Why they putting kohli up with abd? Lol.,2
AB looking to go big this over,2
RCB will do well to get 170 with 2 out of the 4 overs from Bumrah,3
"Bumrah to ABD ---> BOOM

Edit:Sorry, that was bad.",3
"Kohli will be back bois, don't worry",6
"Can't relax. Need to target bumrah as well. With wickets in hand. Paddikal, washi, dube, Gurkeerat can all keep smashing",2
"When I start my porn production company, I'll call it ""DP world""",6
yeee smack that bitch butcher,7
I heard a faint nick,1
Kohli and Bumrah came out of lockdown absolutely terrible,30
AbD is a true genius. Being out of the international game for a while now and still being able to time the ball that sweetly is stuff of gold.,39
"Now that Virat is expecting a kid, he is not going to be at his peak like he used to be. I have noticed this trend with many players. They kinda lose that raw aggression that made them special.",7
It's such a joy to watch abd play,6
Bumrah bb. What has happened to you?,1
"virat's bad form doesn't hurt as much, but bumrah getting tonked is giving me trauma.",15
Bumrah where are your yorkers? These slow balls won't work against ABD,18
Classic ABD.,16
Ab fucking mi rn,2
Bumrah's reign at the top wasn't long,2
Remember AB retired from internationals 2 years ago and he's still playing like this .,13
Bumrah must be thinking why didn't Rohit let me bowl to Kohli. Why do I have to deal with ABD,8
Brumrah and Kohli both have been shit from the beginning of 2020.,7
AB is way better this year compared to last,14
Ravi Bishnoi and Bumrah almost have same run up length and same speed when they reach to the crease.. lol,11
fuck i love u abd,6
Ab is pure class always finds the sweet spot.,7
All I wanna see is a 6 smash the window of that Altroz 😂😂😂,20
Ugh this is poor stuff,2
Why is Styris such a Good commentator,4
AB looks way fitter than he did last year.,16
AB go boom boom,11
"Dont worry bois, VK will be back",2
ABD has such awesome shots in his repertoire,4
What clean shots ab plays man,1
ABD's Strike rate & consistency is insane he'll be first player in my T20 team,6
Damn should cricketers go r/MGTOW,6
"Dammit, waiting for someone to hit the Altroz, the Gold Standard of Hatchbacks, just to watch it explode like Hans Moleman's car and expose the lie",5
What happened to Bumrah yorkers? :(,8
In the 3 matches Bumrah has barely bowled 5-6 yorkers,7
Even if Bumrah goes for 30 runs in his last 2 overs he won't go for 40 runs in 4 overs. Did I blow your mind?,8
Man if this guy hadn't retired South Africa would've had a good run in the WC. Still the best South African batsman and 2 years after his retirement still one of the best in the world.,26
Lol Bumrah read it,6
"With that kind of power and timing still left in your game, why would you ever retire from Intl cricket??",5
Kohli wasn't good in Practice games also,4
Followed him around like deadlines keep finding me.,11
Does anyone know why the max points per game for Fair Play award is 11 and not 10? 11 seems so werid,3
Padikkal has not shown big hitting prowess but he still keeps his strike rate healthy. Very impressive,5
Oh no,2
A B De Villiers completes 4500 runs in IPL.,13
Devdutt seems to be a complete package. Not only for T20 but other formats too. Too early to decide but who knows he's in Virat's team. If he performs consistently he'll soon be in national squad IMO.,21
Hit him in the knee,1
Is this the beginning of end of the kolhi era??,6
"Even RCB is hitting the groove, who am I to make fun of now? Myself?",6
"Calm down, Bumrah is just 20 in 2.5 overs.

You call that garbage???",5
The fake audio is for the tv audience only or for the players too?,3
Why Bumrah is being a jerk here.,6
I would rather padikkal get off the field now,-8
That's big,1
vijay shankar and padikkal 🤝 getting hit by bumrah.,8
Koach Kohli should've wasted 3 less balls at least.,6
Damn that's lit,9
Bumrah Kohli both not performing. I'm scared,20
Almost hit the cameraman,7
Evey time abd pulls I just love to watch his follow through u bat rotating like a fucking blade behind his back. Glorious,10
I can't possibly get any more erect.,9
"ABD

ABD

ABD",18
Bumrah pulls of the mask to show that he was Umesh all along,13
My mouth is filled with saliva what the fuck???,4
AB was looking set.. unfortunate this happened now.. usually these events follow with a wicket or two..😬,7
RIP us.,16
Bumrah getting tonked,11
Yep. That one's staying hit.,6
ABD = GOD,6
"**AB de Villiers vs MI in overs 16-20 in IPL 2019**

26 balls

65 runs

One dismissa
SR 250.00",8
Always enjoy while watching ABD batting.. ❤❤❤,11
Hopefully it is not major,2
Bumrah what the fuck man,6
"I usually love the dugout. Logged into the dugout, saw Irfan Pathan talking and immediately switched to the English stream...",-1
"If Bumrah goes on to have a bad IPL, I'll still consider him the best India has to offer. He's allowed to fail.",3
No fucks given by abd failed prediction fml,3
"ABD vs Bumrah 

ABD:1 Bumrah:0",7
"Curious whether Indian fans see Padikkal breaking through to the national team soon, and if so, where does he fit in the order?",1
ABD’s wife should allow him to donate sperm. His genes should be propagated far and wide,7
Fucking length balls on middle stump GG,6
[deleted],31
"How long was that hit.


Definitely 100+",2
"Cue Ian Bishop saying ""Abraham Benjamin de Villiers"". Wish he was here.",5
How do they award fair play points?,1
What a shot. Damn I miss him in SA colors.,7
If he smoked Bumrah I weep for the fate of Pattinson's fast off spin,9
Why the hell did he retire? He's still got it 110%.,-1
ABD is such a gem. I can't find the right words.,2
[deleted],-1
"This is why I hate Fantasy..I'm happy that ABD is my captain but sad since I support MI, so I'm just confused...",2
Nothing more satisfying than watching bumrah get smashed around like that,1
Very poor lengths by Bumrah's standard,3
"Did he even get any treatment?

Felt like a water break lol.",3
Would be fun to watch AB bat in Sharjah lol,4
"Fuck start sports with theirs stupid ads, couldn't see the 6 because they started at the end moment, didn't show the replay because they started ads as soon as the ball went for a 6.",3
Bumrah should only bowl Yorkers,1
"Even though he is set, won't mind if all Dev does is give the strike to ABD",2
Kohli we can say is distracted and has already been performing for over a decade but what is Bumrahs excuse for turning shit at 26?,3
"As an Indian , I am more worried about Bumrah s form than Kohli s",4
"IPl: Gives Indian Superstars and Taketh away Superstars too .



Bumrah (2016-2020) Great run 👏",1
This man is of a different class. Takes apart the best bowlers in the world for fun.,5
Bumrah is so off,2
abraham benjamin de villiers TAKE A BOW!!,2
bruhh they not even playing umesh and bumrah is getting plastered. really bad day for us.,6
"Damn, almost.",3
"no one hates on indian players more than indian fans, i swear",11
Bumrah will be the difference if we don't make it to the top 4.,1
Would've been a six in Sharjah,6
Kohli bringing his big brother to the playground after rohit bullied him.,3
Worried about LOI Bunrah but if it means he breaths fire in Tests then it's not that bad,3
Well played padikkal,3
Kieron Pollard at boundary line is a cheat sheet,11
YESSS BOULT,1
"ABD to Boult: How you doing man

Boult: Ignores!!

Me: Intensified.",9
Our number 1 batsman and number 1 bowler are not looking too great. My excitement and expectation for Aussie tour is at all time low.,8
[deleted],9
Well played Padikkal,5
A retired Devilliers is still better than most batsmen in their prime.,82
"Boult is my hero, Pollard my lover",2
Well played kid.,4
"Damn, that wasn’t a bad hit",5
That was a six...these grounds are frustrating,10
ABD making Bumrah look like a regular bowler. What a humbling experience that must be..,7
[deleted],-1
Ah man feels bad but still a classy innings,11
"People crying about bumrah getting hit for 4/6, it's T20 and it's not like people aren't allowed to hit. Other bowlers have same run rate as his?",9
just imagine if moeen ali was coming in next  instead of dube,7
Not Udana :(,4
"Cricbuzz’s commentary whenever ABD hits a six. 

“Okay don’t bowl there to AB”",14
"**17.1** Boult to Padikkal, OUT, >b>can't clear Pollard.** **154-3**

D Padikkal c Pollard b Boult 54 (40b 5x4 2x6) SR: 135.00",3
Padikkal picked wrong fielder.Anywhere in the arc its Pollard's.,6
That would have been a 6 in Sharjah,4
Incoming Shivam Dube masterclass 12(11),7
"its okay he was tired, need to hit more now",6
Boult > Bumrah.,4
That would have been a six out of Sharjah stadium,19
This was six in Sharjah..,14
Unlucky. It was a slower one. Not much he could do. Well batted Paddi.,5
2 slower balls to get both the openers out. Dube could be a handy bowler with the size of this ground.,1
Shot of a tired man. Well played nonetheless from Devdutt once again.,6
30-40 off last 3 overs bois,5
padikkal did great dude,6
Have yorkers lost their charm now? Hardly see any bowler bowling yorkers in the death overs,3
When was the last time Bumrah bowled a perfect yorker,6
Padikkal>Dhawan,-4
"Noooo, send in the Mannnnnn",2
Ggwp Padikkal,5
"**Devdutt Padikkal innings**

Balls 21-30: 9 runs (SR 90)

Balls 31-40: 22 runs (SR 220)",11
How is boult getting away with this,0
Fuck! I want to watch ABD play at Sharjah...,12
Haven't seen those trademark Bumrah yorker for a while now.,2
China Yuvaraj is on the crease.,5
Damn I cant wait to watch ab at Sarjah at the same time I really dont want to see Rcb bowl at Sarjah,6
Is it just me or Rohit looks thinner than usual,6
I read Dube as Lube,6
"Now in the batting line up is the holy Trinity of 

Dube, Mann, Sundar lmao",2
Dube just don't eat balls. I saw Washi hitting great sixes in nets,5
Dube will score a boundary on the second ball and then proceeds to miss and end up in 11(12),3
Devbutt should be groomed to be our next captain. Same way Gill is being groomed by KKR,5
Boult bowling some fire,2
Where is Hardik?,1
Dube time to pull a Tewatia,1
Dube is Vijay Shankar of RCB.,5
Dube😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅,1
"Every player needs a nemesis to improve, AB spanking Bumrah will only make him more venomous",6
"why is Dube's strike rate only 111, I thought he was a hitter",3
cmon dube show u can play and just not a ig model wanabee,1
Now AB wont forget to hot him for a six,2
Slower bouncer is cricket's version of a boop,3
"This is a good over

Edit: was",1
Boult is good. Why was he warming the bench at delhi?,13
I want to watch Gill and padikkal opening for India.,6
"As long as there is no Umesh and Dube doesn't bowl, I'm calling this an RCB win boys,,",3
just 4 off the over in 5 balls,2
Did they borrow Shivam Dube from Star Plus TV serials?,3
"If Dube is your number 5, then RCB are going to have a few problems unless there's an opening stand similar to today",6
That hattrick meant alot to boult.,5
It’s not his fault this ground is pretty big,10
"Apart from AB, the rest of our middle order is not meant for pinch hitting",7
Dube was hyped in the previous IPL,4
Mr.360,5
Guru Randhawa,2
That single by Dube was a flat six in Sharjah..,14
"ABD.

What a player",15
What a fine over for MI.,5
We finally had a good over and ABD had other plans,19
Welp that's ABD for you lmao,15
Abd never leave us please!!,6
If he came back now he'd still be one of the best in the world.,2
These Fairplay Point system is so boring. Every team getting 10/11! Where are my college professors when you need them..,4
"Slow, half tracker - exactly the worst ball to bowl to AB freaking D.",5
Pollard taking time to throw so that Lord Dube could get back to strike,3
Shot.,3
ABD you beautyyyy,5
"Damn. I envy this supreme confidence to be inches away from the boundary rope and casually stroll along it with zero fear of touching it.

Pandya did it the previous game too with his catch.",6
"Dick hit finch, suffer.


Headbutt ABD, tz hell unleashed",3
Dube all hight no fight,2
Guys! When are we playing at Sharjah?.,5
Stop bowling length balls ffs,5
Oooohhhhhhhhhh,2
Brisbane Heat are wondering where was this AB,4
In Sharjah that would be well in the pharmacy.,6
Marry me ADB ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),5
Trent Boult with some damn good bowling when we needed it the most.,1
Bumrah bowls one bad over everyone on r/cricket we lost him what are gonna do,5
Shouldn't have bowled a slower one. Fast bouncer to ABD,2
Stand and deliver,2
We indians need to more chilled with our cricket heroes. Bumrah is struggling don't defend. This same Boult have been carted by MSD few years back in IPL. Doesn't mean Boult can't win T20 WC next year.,5
Stop complaining small/large grounds and watch the fucking game y’all.,5
Ab is still definitely SA's best t20 batsman despite being retired.,11
"Hardik is discount Stokes. Dube, 3D shankhar is discount Hardik.",3
RCB playing so flawlessly,3
Ni maar sutya...,2
does anyone remember when devillers use to come in the 16th of rcb in the past and used to smack 50\* odd in the end of the innings,8
Even though he fucks ur team over you just can't help but admire it,7
Imagine ABD at Sharjah.,7
That De Villiers six in Sharjah would have landed in Abu Dhabi.,7
Looks like Shane Bond has skipped the yorker balls session with MI bowlers. Its either slow cutters or length,6
Mama ambani will give you jio fiber for free abd. Just please stop abusing MI,9
Faf and Abd are in some phenomenal form this IPL!,3
What a satisfying shot from AB,1
Look how they massacred ma boi Mumbai,10
bro these are hella fuckin massive wow this is incredible i cant begin to describe what a treat this is,5
Dube hit out or get out da,1
How Does ABD always reaches 50 so nonchalantly.,46
guys predict how much u think will be scored in 2 overs?,3
So our best batsman and our best bowler both looking completely out of touch and nowhere near their prime. Makes me worried for the national side. I really don't wanna see Koach or Boom Boom struggling like this.,16
Gj dube just stay at the non strikers end,3
Fuck that Josh Hosh ad with the girl under the umbrella is HOT,7
Straight four!,5
Bumrah finished,2
Bumrah is in love with ABD,3
Why are ya cunts shitting on Dube? He has played 0 dot balls,8
Superman ABD,6
He's in the zone. There's no stopping him now,7
This De Villiers guy looks like a real deal,7
"Striking at 223, hmmmm. Below par for ab.",6
De Villiers treating Bumrah like a club bowler,9
That’s not a Yorker lol,4
Why always us AB?,5
ABD smacking world #1 & #2. What else is new.,19
Stop treating boom boom like a club bowler ABD.,7
"Abraham Benjamin ""I turn up, I turn it on"" de Villiers",1
Folks being harsh on Dube. He does not get enough opportunities. Most of the times he is expected to walk in and hit the balls out of the ground. It's unfair to compare him to specialist batsmen.,4
i have to pee but ill wait to see abd shit on mi bowlers lmao,3
Boom boom belting,1
Bumrah needs to change his hero from Zlatan to Lewandowski 😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂,1
I've lost count of how many times AB has carried RCB.,16
Send chahal in next. Please,0
This man is cut from a different cloth,4
ABD is too good a player to retire from international cricket,5
Bumrah trying to get into the Dinda Academy,2
"without boom working, MI's bowling really looks out of sorts. oofff it hurts.",2
"not many can generate that much power against that ball 
 
I'll just put that down to ABDs brilliance rather than Bumrah losing his magic",7
How is that a Yorker sunny g,3
Can anyone beat prime AB's timing during power hitting?,2
Takes something to hit a 147k yorker for a four.,5
SA should give this AB guy a chance imo.. Looks decent...,4
Bet the Saffers select De Villiers tomorrow,2
Seems like Kohli is sitting in bathroom and crying after that innings.,7
"Kohli must recommend ABD's name for a big bonus. Whatever RCB is paying him, isn't even close to his real value.",1
Bumrah will be Kohli's additive inverse so we have no disadvantage.,4
MI needs Akshdeep Nath,2
Thank god we are playing IPL and not world T20 because bumrah and kohli SUCK rn,4
Bumrah Era ~ Mendis Era,3
Who is bowling the last over,1
Bumrah is bowling some fast pies. Like a right-arm Wahab Riaz.,7
Why did retire though? Uhh,3
ABD is a joy to watch no matter what team you support,7
AB is in great form this season!,8
abhishek devilliers,3
Dube finally played a good shot,2
Good thing is Bumrah won't have to bowl to ABD in SA jersey. 😁,2
definitely a par score,1
"If RCB win today, they will move above CSK.... That's gonna look strange.",2
Only bat first now,1
"Just tuned in and Damn, what’s up with Kohli? 3 in 11 balls in a T20 and falling to a spinner yet again?",3
Chahal vibing,4
Bumrah...more like Gumrah /s,5
"Oo Lord dube, give me your wisdom",1
Bumrah being humbled today..,1
Bumrah bowling hot garbage,4
Abd built different,3
Dube uppercutting Bumrah for 4. 2020 is weird,5
Scenes when they force abd to keep wickets and he gets his back problems again.,2
Make chahal captain.,5
This is what Samson tried to play yesterday but the slower pace did him in,2
"Bumrah- Our strike bowler.
Kohli- Our main batsman.

Both out of form. 
Thank God Australia series is so far.",4
[deleted],3
Bumrah bowling like a bum,6
Handsome Dube ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ ),2
Lol Dube hitting bumrah,5
Did AB just hit a 4 off a Yorker??,12
"Ab never ever goes out of form, does he?",9
That's honestly terrible from Bumrah. Bowling short with the third man in.,10
Mi fucked up the last few overs 180 should have been enough.,2
I like how they are showing the real captain after every hit.,9
bowl a no bball,3
So is it safe to say that Kohli and Bumrah have lost their form forever and we'll crush India 5-0 this summer? I'm fine with that.,13
"""Look at the way the ball hits the middle of the bat!"" - Sunny G with some astute analysis.",9
That's massive,8
Where are the South African talent scouts at? There is this ABD guy who looks very promising...,14
Holy fucking shit,7
"What the fuck.

Absolutely insane hitting.",13
I'll cry like a lil bitch when abd decides to retire from cricket and stops playing for us,28
bruh,3
BANG,5
What happened to Bumrah Yorkers?,7
Wow that was gorgeous,6
Fuck off AB I love you,12
Ohh Virat what has happened to you😞😞😞....,3
ABDDDDDDD,5
That was clean as gillete mach 3,3
Bumrah finishes with 42 .,4
"Shivam Dube is that tall guy in college, who is part of each extra-curricular activity group, goes to gym, barely passes in each subject but always acts cool.",6
Goddamnit I will not be ashamed to suck AB off,12
AB dispatching Bumrah like the trash he is /s,7
Fucking hell Bumrah,3
Bumrah getting schooled,5
That sound.... that goddamn orgasmic sound off the bat. Ooof,6
Damn bumrah got raw dogged,11
Fucking hell man AB... Way to end a career lmao,10
Bumrah is joining Dinda academy,2
Wow that is sensational! Always a pleasure to watch de Villiers,7
oh..wow.. feelsgoodman...😊,3
Bhenchod whatta shot! Absolutely demolished that!,5
"Dear AB , plis stop spanking Bumrah.",6
"English : Oh that's a huge wicket. ABD goes for 5 

.
. Hindi: Bohot badi macchali fasayai hai.",6
When I die I want ab De villiers highlights to be played at my funeral,9
Bumrah baby. Wat you doin,7
I love this man with my whole heart,18
I cant believe this😳,6
AB is a monster,6
Paisa vasool 😍,5
Oh my God,5
"Just turned on the TV, gavaskar must be the happiest man today eh",3
Bumrah now a proud member of Dinda Academy,7
That's how 2020 is treating everyone so....,3
"What a shot, cleared 20 rows. ABD you fucking legend.",5
Abd lifts Bumrah to Lord Bumrah,3
"WTF, LULULOL",3
This guy should get back into internationals. You can't leave your team with such form.,3
ABD IS MY FATHER.,3
"Fk,  that bat sound tho...",2
in the presence of genius,2
This man is on another level,2
Holy smokes fuck me,1

Dubeji - single please,4
Just get bat on it give it to AB,1

It's already a good over imo,1
27(8) off Bumrah is almost as bad as Tewatia destroying Cottrell.,7
"Geez, Kohli fucked up the innings. Everybody else was great. Could have ended with 230.",9
Dinda academy meme should end now.,9
Performing like this against MI is insane,12
This is what happens when you chuck a red ball bowler into the IPL. Was never gonna end too well if one of the batsmen got their eye in against him.,1
where are all guys saying “man even 160-170” looks tough now haha,13

Who's more disappointing today? Bumrah or Kohli?,9
A score above 200 would be great for us,3
"Pattinson has caught the shit bowling bug too, honestly what is this fuck, I",7
Don’t think MI can win this today. No way there can be two successful 200 score chases on consecutive days.,9
That's what she said.,2
MI have never chased 200+. 1 four and we might as well call it a day,23

Pattinson and Bumrah are trying to measure dicks by seeing who can give more runs... more runs conceded means bigger dick.,9

200 AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,-1
I guess Dube ain't that bad . . . . . . .,1
AB cheating by batting at both ends.,6
Fade my flair,0
200 with a Koach misfire. Good stuff.,2
imfucking in love w this years ipl,2
When kohli departed nobody thought of 200 ..let's see how much gas mumbai have ..zampa and chahal are the key.,4
Dube finally doing justice to his reputation,1
Pathetic bowling or real beauty of a batting pitch? I believe it's the former than the latter...,0
Dube cameo might just have buried the chase.,4
Has Yorker go out of fashion?,5
"Here's an advice lads, pronounce dube like dude with a b and it's more fun this way",3
Dube this is your best chance to challenge Kohli for the RCB Captaincy,9
okay now we see koach,0
Damn,0
Dube had hit 5 sixes in 5 balls in Ranji i guess,3
It looks like RCB are only gonna rise up to occasion if Kohli is out of form.,3
"Dube, Dubai and Sixes.",4
That ending was brilliant,1
"What a finish! Let's go! Dube reverse jinx worked. 

Imagine the score without the 3(11)",3
They prepared for Kohli but Dube sir came out of syllabus,5
If we chase this down its really gonna break RCB,6
No chance we could win this. MI are absolute garbage this year with all these chonkers floating around the XI.,1
Shivam Dube trying his best to not be associated with the likes of 3D! *SRH in shambles*,7
Kohli looks like he has coronavirus never seen his energy so low,6
okay now we see koach,3
"Dube - 27* (10)
Kohli- 3 (11)

Dube > Kohli confirmed?",15
Dube in Dubai,3
Whew. Never write off anyone. Theme of this IPL. What a little gem on an innings Dube ji!!!,4
"Shivam for number 4. Left hander, can hit sixes, score decentl4in the middle overs. They should give him a try",3
"There’s not much dew around, the pitch gets significantly slower in the second innings and chasing teams didn’t have much success this year so far

Brohit after winning the toss : *We’ll bowl first, thanks*",11
"So, who was saying Dube is discounted 3D? Talk naah.",4
"Dube has done really well, but watch RCB lose this because RCB.",3
Hope all the hitting on his balls isn't affecting Bumrah's confidence.,4
"Mitchell McCleneghan ***smiles***, but from the inside",4
Is Bhabhi gonna leave Virat for Dube? :(,-8
"Everyone played well, except you koach!!!",1
Rohit is like fuck ..can't eat vada pavs now during the break...,2
Without Umesh I think 200 is enough... hope they don’t prove me wrong.,4
Mumbai Indians are nothing special without Malinga and Bumrah both in the team.,1
Imagine rcb losing from here,6
"Don't worry, we got an Umesh

Edit: Thank fuck I didn't see the playing XI",4
Nothing to say just pakistani fan meme guy reaction.,6
Feels good that for once RCB are the ones to score 80 in the last four rather than being on the receiving end.,6
I would love for CSK & MI to not make it to the playoffs this year. We need new winners.,9
"What's with this Dinda academy meme, it's not funny and it's pretty disgraceful",8
"I was about to comment it was a small victory to keep them from reaching 200.. 

Ugh.",3
"If your team scores below par score and lose the match there won't be much pain. But after hitting 200 odd runs if they lose the match, that's real pain, the pain RCB wants to give today.",6
"We simply never chase 200. But again, nobody ever chased 224 before yesterday",6
Is it just me or are the commentators wayy nicer to Kohli than they were to Tewatia yesterday,13
https://ibb.co/J2Q8RJ7,2
"Man poor Kohli, only guy that missed out today, everyone else batted great",3
whos this V. kohli. DROP HIM ALREADY !!!!!,18
we gonna need a depression thread today.,4
Kohli is the only failure on that scoreboard.,7
"Almost 80 runs in the last 5 overs, now RCB bowlers need to not shit the bed",7
okay.. let's keep calm and hope for the best.. gonna be hell of a chase if MI can pull it off.. hopefully they won't..,2
Ok lads. I am not ready for the second innings lol.,1
"Man, feeling sad for kohli for some reason.",7
So Mumbai chasing this in 18? 19?,5
Play both Dube and Tewatia in T20Is for India. These guys can hit class international bowlers and can bowl decently too.,-1
Rcb scored 200+ and kohli just contributed 3 runs. Sign of good things to come.,7
"With bumrah out of form and Bhuvi not being the same we gonna struggle in next T20 worldcup . Only shami good but can't trust him at death, we have only saini atm.",7
Where were you when Shivam Dube became the best batsman in india 😝,6
Have all the bowlers forgotten what yorkers are?,8
Lol MI get rekt,7
"Dear Diary,




Today we lost Bumrah but we found Dube ❤️",11
Commentator can’t stop sucking off De Villiers even after an amazing delivery where all he could do was get a single,4
Its definitely one of those matches where rohit gets out under 20,14
Dube to r/cricket : bol na ab bola na madarchod,15
Holy hell everyone scored besides Koach,9
Seems like Bumrah is finished which does not bode well for India.,-8
RCB and it's players just need to be memed to glory. Dube raking in the riches tonight,5
Imagine being that one guy who didnt perform,5
Great team batting effort,4
RCB actually looks balanced this year. Scoring 200 without Kohli is insane. They should make it to the play offs,5
Inb4 Kock century,2
Ab always makes a point to destroy the best bowler any opposition have.,5
The next IPL will be before the world cup right? Really need Kohli and Bumrah back in form. Not like it's too late in this IPL but still,5
Calling every poor bowler  dinda is fucking stupid as if he is the first ever   bowler who gave fucking  runs.,6
"Koach: 3 (11) at at a SR of 27  
The Rest: 188 (109) at 172

"RCB playing a responsible innings with the bat

2020 is definitely an unpredictable year",9

"If we remove Kohli's 3(11), 198 in (18.1)",12
Good news for RCB - Umesh is not going to bowl. Tough luck MI.,8
Not sure how this pitch was tbh. Maybe 10 runs short? What do you guys think,0
"Cant believe we reached 200 after that innings from kohli, seems like the last game really shook the team .",8
"So another game without Hardik bowling. Sounds like Harsha was right when he said Hardik is trying to become a batting allrounder because of the risk of injury.

Now, the question is, if Hardik stops bowling for India, does his batting alone warrant a spot?",12
Time for RCB bowlers to concede this all away.,2
"Kohli Era is over

it's now the Dube Era",5

If Koach gets into even half the form he had in 2016, RCB surely has chances.",16

Always rated Washi. Koach didn't utilise his talents well.,4
Have you guys ever seen these many IPL matches lost after winning the toss?,3
"Game, set, match??",2
"How the hell did kohli suddenly become a mature captain with good team selections right when he had to face mumbai? 

Screw this shit, I'm going to sleep",8
A reminder that Kohli let Sundar bowl a grand total of 3 overs in the first two matches.,13
virat's ads are fucking cringe and pretentious,5

We will see DeKock.,3
How many variations of the fantasy league game are out there for real? 😂 Lost track at this point,12
Rohit has always had problems with Sundar. Great captaincy.,8
"No Umesh to spoil it now.



I am gonna cry",4
Invoking the waqt badal diya jazbaat badal diye mode. Totally appropriate today given the absolute chutyagiri pulled by Rohit at the toss.,8
Ffs RCB why did you have to drop Umesh against MI,6
Now we watch rohit cry over his batsmans poor performance from the stands. I have watched rohit more like that then him on batting pitch,-2
Kohli finally realizes Sundar isn't a part timer lmao,6
Still so much batting for MI w/ Pollard and Pandya brothers,3
Are we seeing a semblance of Tewatia from Kishan here?,6
How exactly are you going to teach nursery kids coding? Most importantly why? This ad is there to promote more stress on kids than ever. Fucking hell let them live their lives atleast till 10th before you force them down that mindless road,26
Finish sundara off within first 8. He will go for plenty later.,8
Shit ball.,4
Kohli transitioning into a specialist captain like MS,6
UnAcADeMy SiX god I hate hearing that,15
Washy's incredible bowling of 3 in 2 overs compensated for Kohli's crap innings of 3(11),9
really painful to watch rn. boom getting battered and sundar conceding 1 run an over.,2
Tough to admit but beaufiful captaincy from Kohli in the powerplay.,8
"Weeeew, that fucking flew.",1
"Yeah Virat had a bad day , we know",7
Now Sundar is in  warne academy .,3
Rcb kind off had an advantage by playing 2 matches here.,2
"I wonder when the consensus on winning the toss and bowling first among the teams would change. Irrespective of the due factor, chasing anything above 160-170 seems quite challenging in Abu Dhabi/Dubai.",2
Is this what hope feels like?,15
Hope Ishan has 20 rupees,11
Trying so hard to tone down the excitement,6
So Bangalore dweller here... at what point does Koach bring himself on to bowl?,12

Negi on for Finch?,2
Do they change the ball after every big six?,6
This match is over.,1
"Sure, why not? an ipl match thread between mumbai and bangalore on r/cricket is as appropriate as any a place for this question

Does the third umpire come in to give the new balls?,2
Ahh missing umesh here.,3
"Udana opening could have cost them way more but I'm happy with a wicket and 10rpo, especially in a chase like this. He's much better when the field is back and he's spamming slower balls",7
This feels like RCB's best bowling lineup...,4
Third over from Washington or nah,2
Boys finding it difficult to find a white ball on a black background.,3
Kohli would again find some way to fuck this uo.,3
Remember the good ol days when lord Siraj and lord Umesh used to boss rival teams,10

[RCB missing a trick by not bowling Sundar in the powerplay. I remember him being so effective in that period specially in that series where he won Man of the Series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/iwz52d/match_thread_3rd_match_sunrisers_hyderabad_v/g64mscd/)",6
MI like CSK is holding onto past glory but is no where near any good.,-1
NoHit Sharma sitting in train station waiting for vadapaav stall to open,7
Kohli likes to behave in a mature manner and do the right thing occasionally when he is captain. Make no mistake though... This is an anomaly and not something Koach is capable of doing over extended periods.,3
MI have great batting depth though.,3
"Rohit had consistently used Sundar in powerplay successfully for India, but Kohli never did so. No idea why.",8
Imagine subbing Udana for Morris. RCB a team to watch out for!!,5
Always a better idea to bat first against MI. There's no such thing as an easy chase against MI. Every team makes a meal out of even the smallest chase against them.,4
Kishan makes me cry,5
Rotate the strike people.,8
Anjum Chopra is quite a boring commentator and I don't mean this in a sexist way. She is genuinely boring to hear.,14
"Met Kartik in an elevator in Vizag last year. Posed for pics with my entire family. Really really nice guy, very polite. 

Edit: Murali Kartik",12
Saini nailing those Yorkers.,11
"it's confirmed guys, Koach is just playing as a specialist captain in this season. He will just focus on team selection and bowling changes.",20
Nobody is predicting anything until H Pandya and Pollard get out. They can easily change the game alone,9
The footage of Mumbai dressing room is not broadcast live as they do not want mirrorception on the nearby tv,6

AB keeping wickets is huge for RCB. Opens up many options,5
What was that AB xD,0
Folks thinking this match isn’t over as if everyone is Tewatia.,8
Sundar should be given a test debut soon. Far more consistent in line and length than Ashwin.,-4
Is WhiteHatJr just another scam?,12
Desert -> KFC -> Finch. He ain't coming back.,5
"got a 2-minute lecture on sexism from mummy 'cause I said ""Anjum Chopra's commentary sucks!""",7
Finch getting hit in the box brought all this luck. He should do try and do it every match.,3
Why wasn't sundar given 4 overs in any of the previous matches?,3
"Missing Memesh here.

He would have made the match interesting with his spray bowling.",8

Good batting by kishan and white kishan,10
Might as well gives chance to chris lynn. Kishan can keep wickets.,5
Hope the keeping doesn't over exert AB,4
LOL. The average Wankhede is about 68m. I played at a bigger ground than that topped with lush green grass yesterday.,4
fantastic spell,3
Mumbai is going at less than 6!,6
Sundar single handedly ruined MI's powerplay lol,24
Excellent bowling. Washi should have bowled more in previous matches.,4
My hotstar app is not working on pip mode. Any fix ?,3
I can't believe Koach is being so tactically astute. Must be Nags giving him tips,8
Finally Virat using Sundar correctly . He needs to give him more power play overs especially in bigger grounds. May be should avoid in Sharjah,2
Finish Washington off,2
RCB is doing a CSK here on Mumbai. Strangling them with all their spin bowling variations. Just don't have these many at Sharjah against KKR.,0
"Ngl... I can eat Maggi special masala with just about anything. Rice, bread, Maggi, roti anything. It is absolutely crazy good!",3
I can't believe my eyes,2

Washington bowling like it's a test match lol,5

life as an rcb fan - hard to appreciate the good times because of the nagging feeling that it about to all go wrong,12
QDK is a bit useless against spin,1
Jana bankable player - Washington Sundar,7
Sundar bowling 3 overs in the powerplay and going for just 7 runs while picking up the wicket of Rohit. This is just dream stuff!,5
How exactly RCB is going to botch this?,4
12 overs of quality spin from RCB today,2
Yoganaginder chahal is the key.,1
"In a chase of 202

Sundar giving 7 runs in 3 over in pp

RCB green dress > RCB red dress,2
Always seems like Murali Kartik is on a strict diet of dictionaries during IPL.,6
"I am a simple man, I love the ball trail animation.",6
Sundar built his reputation as a specialist powerplay spinner (like Badree) and even got selected for India. Maybe it didn’t work out in Chinnasamy but atleast RCB figured out early here. Hope they a different plan for Sharjah,3
its boring now lol i doubt hardick can lead them to a dub,4
"Oh crap, Kohler failed again. I'm tempted to search ""Anushka"" on twitter and sort by latest",4

Out!!,2

Vijay Shankar sneaking in questions to know if his 3D™ skills would come into play later ;-),11
KL and Mayank. GOAT combo,8
MI should just hope they scrape to 110-3 in around 14 overs and see off the leggies and try to score 90 in 6 off Dube Udana and Saini. Sounding tough already but no point losing wickets here,8
"Finish the spin overs now. When pollard comes, pacers should bowl slow",5
"Unpopular opinion 

Ab shud bat ahead of Kohli if openers give rcb a decent start

"There is something deeply uncomfortable hearing the name ""unacademy"" mentioned in any cricketing context.",18
Kohli and Bumrah not performing well in this IPL. Worries me as an Indian fan. Hope Hardik finds his rhythm after the injury.,15
Is all future cricket going to be judged with Tewatia as the benchmark? I wonder. Mumbai is right now at around 0.75 Tw.,15
this partnership better be big,5
"Pandya to Yuzi at 8.3 over: Muh mein le le.

Is Kishan anchoring the chase?,2
Who would have thought! Mayak bossing this year with 170 Strike rate. He is couple runs away from claiming orange cap from Rahul.,7
Aah if only Stoinis was there in the RCB Camp too!,1

Chahal is the only shining light for Indian LOI side.,5

Also they can fuck off with these ads targeting kids from 4th,5th and 6th standards. You already have blood on your hands with the crazy amount of student suicides, don't bring in small children into this",30
I wonder if hardik will launch sundar.,-3
Nobody beats dravid in ads. Straight faced as fuck,13
Commentary is so boring that they are always focusing on boundary dimensions,2
atleast cross 150 please. make it respectable.,1
3 sixes loading,0
Sundar v hardick,-1
Don't tell me watching those idiots dance doesn't make you feel good about yourselves,1
Ishan Kishan will probably cost Pandya his wicket by not scoring,-2
"Wow wtf is up with these IPL threads and downvoters?

Just salty fans of losing teams or what? It's a real shame",2
Mumbai has been  uncharacteristically calm in run chase ...calm or lazy or the rcb is bowling well ?,3
Sal Khan is half Indian Bengali and half Bangladeshi. Great man. Let there be Khan Academy Kamaal Catches thank you,9

No INTENT^TM,5

"RCB needs to back our domestic players like Padikkal, Dube and Sundar. Look at how MI and CSK back their domestic players. Reduce dependence on foreigners",12
Maybe Mumbai has taken a few pages out of CSK’s playbook and are going for NRR?,6
This fake crowd is very biased towards RCB,4
Sundar's figures are too good!,5
Insane spell,2
Downvoter is here today too O.o,3
Sundar's had a killer spell today. Love to see it! Not a single boundary conceded.. unbelievable stuff,6
pandya has gone too soft after having a baby. /s,3
Sundar finally got a full spell.,7
Ati-sundar spell,7
Terrific from Sundar.,6
"That's a superb performance from Sundar

1-12 in 4 overs during a chase of 202 is invaluable",5
No boundary off Sundar. What bowling is this!!,4
Double Penetration World are RCB sponsors? Jeeeez!,7
"Washington Sundar, u brilliant bastard",3
Strike rate of fucking 15.4 on a good length. George Washington is a God,2
Are we watching MI or CSK?,2
MI and CSK being shitty this time,1
Was hoping koach would use sunder well but damn,3
lmao Nehra said Rohit gonna score more runs than Koach! RIP nehra ji,-2
Finally my boi Sundar got to bowl his quota. 4-12-1 defending 201 is a match winning effort.,6
where does this sundar go when playing internationals?,1
MOTM ABD or Sundar?,2
!stopbot,2
12 runs from 4 overs defending 200 ? It would be understatement if I say sunder was economical,8
Okay then. NRR it is,4
"4-0-12-1

Damn nice Washi!",7
Are bhai maronge kab? Nets me?,2
Sundar bowled 20% of balls overall innings and conceded 12 runs,11
Excellent spell. 12 runs of 4 overs while bowling during PP when 200+ chase is on. Take a bow Washi!,3
[deleted],2
I reckon it's out of reach for Mumbai right now but after yesterday it feels wrong to write anyone off,7
Sundar very sundar stats today. Take a bow.,11
Instead of complaining about downvoters how about we upvote everything to nullify it?,3
"RCB have a lot of weapons. They are inconsistent because they don't how and when to use them.
Not utilising Washington Sundar in the powerplay until today's game is an great example. Many teams would kill to a have an economical bowler in the powerplay.",9
Renault had a good race yesterday so makes sense that the DP World family is successful here too,3
"When they show these pitch maps, why don't they mirror the LHB's deliveries so that the off-stick remains the same? 

Or do they already do that?",5
Sundar bowling like prime Harbhajan. Jeez. Straight and on good length with a bit of spin.,9
Both champion teams struggling this year,9

Fuck me Sundar's figures are ridiculous,11
What a shot,4
That's a MOTM performance for me,7
Irrfan & Bangar in dugout smh,1
Pace is not the way to go on this pitch,3
Cracking shot. Ishan looks good when he looks good,3
What a bowling yar Washy - Koach,5
Saini getting picked on each of his first delivery by kishan.,3
Bringing a fast bowler when spinners were putting on the pressure was a bad idea,6
Washington with one heck of a spell. He's a very smart bowler with an impressive skill set and also a cricketing brain to go with it,10
That's first dot ball since QDK's wicket,2
Hardik just doesn't have the same edge anymore have the injuries reduced his threat?,2
AB looking a little out of practise behind the stumps,3
moooo,1
Can we also admonish MI when they do similar things as CSK?,2
Needs to bowl a short one.,2
Ishan is a swinger. What do you guys reckon?,1
There's the INTENT™ we were promised,8
Missing Sanju Manju especially when MI is struggling.,1
"Damn, I forgot that Mo was in RCB.

He could be a good option as an allrounder.",2
That looked so cool,1
"Holy fuck, that sound.",3
Wowwww just wowww,3
"Moeen Ali """"We can still lose""""",6
That sound of the bat amidst all the fake background noise ..boom.,5
Saini channeling his inner umeshyadav,1
Kishan was struggling with spin and you give him pace...,2
"Really worried for Bumrah, esp. considering India's trackrecord of ruining fast bowler careers.  Also, btw, highlights how incredible was Malinga to stay at the top and retain the mystery for over a decade.",8

Chris Lynn: yeah Boi I love my life!,8
"Goddamn. Kishan can bat, and switch gears at will",8
And this man was dropped for Sourabh Tiwary,8
Jhonny sins got so happy after that six,6
Oh boy he's cunted that,6
Tewatia mode activated,1
Why is Moeen not in the team?,7
Who the fuck is downvoting my homies!,12
Moeen avoiding awkward situation,3
Crisp,1
Is this going to be a classic rcb match?,4
Tewatia incoming?,2
Can't say we all know RCB bowlers have a track record of working hard to make sure opposition wins,4
Saini doing Umesh now,4
I feel mumbai grounded ishan kishan for 2 matches because of some mischief he made in the quarantine.,6
Saini taking in charge in Umesh absence.,2
It just hurts when moeen doesn't get to play. I don't know why,3
"Sundar in 4 overs: 12 runs

Saini in 3 balls this over: 13 runs",7
WOuld love to see Big Mo in the thick of action. Such a lovely guy!,5
Kishan definitely an upgrade over Tiwary,7
MI bowlers look way to happy considering they jusssst shat the bed.,2
Fuckkk.,2
"Bowled 2 in the slot for 2 sixes, bowled 2 length, for 2 dots",3
Why doesn't Mo Ali have a Brummie Accent given the fact he is born and bred in Birmingham?,4
Why bowl Saini now they are not able to connect the spinners and the pitch is getting slower so spinners could get purchase off the wicket,4
Give the ball to shivam already,4
Washington has to feature in the Indian T20 lineup ahead of Krunal,12
Pacers are struggling this IPL so far. Spin rules,8
Pace off is the way to go,7
phillipe is not getting another game now.,12
So u think Johny Lynns should be there instead of De cock?,7
Huge !!! That is huuugee,3
If Kishan was in our world cup squad we would have won world cup we missed the trick by not playing one more wicketkeeper.,2
Moeen ali -we are in this situation many times but still lost lol,49
up voting all comments cos fuck you downvoter,32
Thats just clean ass striking,9
I love MI and CSK. Both think they are too good for other teams and play with incomprehensible tactics only to get slapped in the face.,5
We might see captains taking the risk of bowling spinners in 19th/20th overs,5
A six here would put the required mental pressure,2
Ooooh,3
I respected Tewatia a lot after yesterday's inning but he lost all respect when he mocked Cottrell in the dressing room.,10
Sneaky mooen taking dig at koach.,6
Poor captaincy by Koach. Should have kept the spinners on for atleast couple of more overs.,-1
Samson or Kishan?,9
Just bowl slower balls on this big ground to get wickets,12
"Guys, worry not. There's no lord Umesh or Lord Siraj today. RCB got it under control",1
This dude downvoting is real mad lmao,14

Good thing kohli isn't on the ropes today. (all in good humor),8
PAWAN NEGI MVP!!!,5
Jeez how huge is this fucking ground,7
Negi has Fanny magnet on for the ball,4
Pawan Negi on fire today,3
Ma boiii Zampa. Spin for the win,3
Patrick Swayze into the attack,2
How long is that boundary though?,1
The last time I check Lynn cannot play spin. So not sure why so many are so desperate to see him in the XI,2
Moeen sounds traumatized and depressed at the same time. A true RCBian,12
Specialist fielder Pawan Negi on the case again. Take that Hetmyer.,4
Dude pawan negi again,1
Lord Negi with his third catch of the match as a sub fielder lol.,3
Anyone has the stat on - max catches taken by a substitute,2
Negi next RCB captain.,7
"Are you kidding me????  
It is Pawan Negi AGAIN!!!

Does he have a magnet that attracts the ball???!!",4
Negi again!,1
Negi at it again. It's following him around.,2
Playing Negi as fielder is chitting 😂😂,7
"Did he just say
""hardik pandya not hard dick enough!""?",15
Lol not Hardik enough,9
Negi making sure he will be specialist fielder for rcb this season coming of as sub,3
Aw Virat and Zampa are best friends,5
Tewatia of fielding guys,2
"Danger man is gone. I repeat, danger Hardik is out of here. ;)",7
Thank god Kohli wasnt fielding there 😂😂,7
Not harrddick enough,1

Thankless job from Lord Negi,3
"3 catches for Negi, damn",5
Boy. Zampa+Chahal. RCB did good with spin :),2
Bye bye useless Pandya time to give up on him MI,-4
People are dunking on MI and CSK after three matches is funny. Both teams put together have 11 trophies They are obviously doing something right.,0
"All the power hitting goes to shit when you make the boundary 80 metres. Lol

We don't need any change to help the bowlers, just make the boundary 75 metres everywhere and watch these ""power hitters"" shit the bed.",6
Negi takes another one. May I introduce MI [Edit: And RCB] fans to /r/fucknegi,7
It's game over right?,1
Negi Specialist Sub,1
"Slightly out of topic but if you bat first at Sharjah get as many as you can ..if you can score 300 don't settle for 280..

"Btw, who's negi in for?",2
"**11.2** Zampa to HH Pandya, OUT, **it's high but not far enough!** Zampa gets the big one. **78-4**

This time big over alert and gets wicket.",5
"*hardik pandya, not hardik enough😌*",8

Did Slatz just say Hardik not enough when hardik holed out...or maybe it was just my ears,4
"""Hardik Pandya..not so Hard-dick now"".. Commentators are high af",15
Both. Hardik and Rohit wickets were heart breaking,6
"Pollard plays 15+ balls, this is going to the last over",7
Am i feeling hope for RCB again,4
"Who's shouting 'catch"" ' for even the ground level shots",10
Hardik better not take the commentary as bait ...he will get into trouble even with covid when he comes back..,1
"Hardik Pandya, desi bikari's Ben Stoke.",-1
r/FuckNegi,5
"Kishan better do a Tewatia now, or Hardik will beat the shit out of him",1
I hope Dube comes into the attack and shows these amateurs how its done.,5
Rcb was looking for a tewatia in batting but instead we got one in bowling (sundar) and fielding (negi),4
"Hardik, kab khoon khaulega re tera?",9
I want a hug from Kohli too,10
It would have been a six at wankhade.,5
"Be like Negi.
Sub and catch 'em all!",10
LawdNegi,8
Alright. Let's ask the key question that's on everyone's mind - Who is going to do a Tewatia today?,4
"This ground seems tailor made for RCB. Lots of decent spinners, backed up by ABD for whom ground size doesn't really matter.",8
RCB making my day :’),9
Did the commentator say he's not Hardick enough!?,25
The original Russel,2
Bhagwan har jagah nahi ho sakte isiliye unhone Pawan Negi ko banaya!,6
Hardik Pandya has been really disappointing so far.,4
we have been waiting for that match winning innings from pandya for years now.,3
Do the players still get paid if they are not in the playing XI?,10
Negi 3 - Kohli 0,15
What's with the fuckin rcb fielding today.,5
Pawan negi playing Pokémon... Gotta catch em all,6
[deleted],9
Hardik is barely pulling his weight in this side as a pure batsman imo,6
I see the yellow shoes and I know it the lord,14
Makes me so happy when RCB plays like this. :’),12
Where are the other fielders ? how is this Negi guy everywhere ?,12
Tracer Bullet.,4
Manoj Tiwary sweating profusely rn,1
Off topic - whats the best reddit app for ios? Tired of manually refreshing live threads,3
Camera focused on negi reactions lmao,8
Paddu my boi,3
Finch really out here taking one in the nuts to sit the game out and allow Negi to have a fielding masterclass of an innings. Peak 4D moves we're witnessing. Most entertaining team in the league amirite 👍😂,26
"I’ve never seen Negi as a good outfielder before, but he’s taken three as a sub.",12
bitch nothing is going to the boundary. rcb was tonking everything. what is going onnnn.,5

"Either bad batting, bad bowling and bad fielding or good batting, good bowling and good fielding. All other combinations are unacceptable at RCB",7

Thoughts on the CRED ads ? Cringe or good ?,4
I find it entertaining to watch Mark Nicholas try to get in right with the IPL style of commentating,3
[removed],5
Negi has contributed more to RCB than V.Kohli in 3 matches.,9
"Man ...thats extremely unprofessional .. imagine gavaskar got into shit for absolutely nothing ... what will happen with this one?   


OTOH this cant be argued as sexism ..so might just blow over..",2
Pawan Negi better get a shout out from Mike Hesson tonight for those 3 catches in the dressing room .Otherwise he will be smashing sixes in the death overs against some poor team who will have no clue.,10
Only 15 RRR Pollard can still do it.,6
Do sub fielders get credit for catches in their official stats,4
All you guys wishing for Tewatia redux... Lol. It was an unbelievable knock alright. But absolutely positively cannot happen twice in a row. No chance.,2
Polly has one match winning innings every season. I want to cash that clause in today,11
Lets see if the ghost of Pollard is any better than ghost of Dhoni.,4
"As a tamil speaker, I chuckle when someone mentions Tewatia.",9
Udana is a death bowler! What’s happening,6
"""caatch"" literally any time the ball is more than 6 inches off the ground",13
"Surprised nobody here has commented on the cup hand  technique of Negi's vs the (surprisingly more common these days) palms-over-face technique that seems to be designed to make high catches, especially under lights, more difficult.",9
Kohli has 7 bowling options on a day his main bowlers have actually turned up lmao,16
you are my cvv and i am otp.. its cringe but pretty funny,4
Warms my heart to see RCB playing like this,8
"No baby, I'll not download CRED, I can't afford any more credit card debt",13
"polly special today? also to this one person downvoting everything, fuck u",1

Why is Isuru bowling now?",5
Ab de villiers though I love him is annoying when being WK,7
"Haven't seen Pollard taking mumbai home from a really tough situation off late, today is the day maybe.",5
I think the most consistent performer this IPL has been the downvoters from every team.,29
"For both MI and CSK, maybe both cores are looking a bit stale...",3
Kohli mistaking udana for umesh i think. Bowling him out now,5
That difference in the economy of spin and pace.,3
"I think Dube instead of Saini for an over or two before the death would be useful.  

Boult got both his wickets off of slower balls when the batsman couldn't generate the power to clear the boundary.",3
Don't tell me Dube is going to bowl the 19th over,5
Who was dehydrated???,1
"Please kick Irfan out of the dugout. He’s relentless, fuck.",2
"IPL has been anti-climactic. Guys not in the indian team have been so good. Chahar, Padikkal, Kishan, Agarwal (not in T20), Tewatia, SKY",2
Great shot! Just the sound off the bat was so crisp and clear.,0
Don't panic young man. You got this,2
Who is the lady on the rcb bench?,4
Gap at same point in innings is only 12 runs. But the game is about momentum and wickets - RCB in the driving seat.,4
"Machas, its true RCB is winning",3
"Just to say that if Bangalore - today have scored 200 without Kohli and that imo are very good signs for their team. If they can manage to choke a little less with that meme bowling, this is as good a chance as they'll have",19
"Pathan has evolved as a commentator, still remember when he started and used to blurt out everything in one breath",9
I hate myself for still believing that this can be chased in a ground not named Sharjah lol,9
Udana is a final over bowler but if he takes Pollard now the game is near done. Kholi is a wild gambler.,8
"It's weird, Warner and Kohli no where the top list of top runscorers for this season so far.",14
Dont let me down Isuru pls.,8
Wow- RCB were ahead by just 6 runs at this point.,21
this is one of mumbai's worst batting performances in recent history.,1
"Sub Negi getting 3 catches today

Fuck fantasy

No one gets those points",22
"AB shouts ""CATCH!"" even when Kishan plays a grounded drive.",22
Getting the slower balls spot on. This is refreshing af,7
There's no way rcb bottles it from here. Surely not?,8
Udana looks like Black Oliver Giroud,19
mumbai indians are shootting themselves in the foot rn,2
[deleted],11
Kohli will be fined again for slow over rate!!,10
Isuru slow balls are damn good,9
Udana selection looking like a master stroke,11
Clearly Steyn has been training with Udana.,5
This is some wonderful t20 bowling,6
Pollard needs to unleash his big dick power now.,8
Just gotta save the NRR now.,5
Imo Lynn's catch vs RCB in 2014 was the best in IPL history given the context of that game,23
Boooooooring! Boooooooring!,1
"Koach bad, Thala bad, Rohit good

Did I just crack r/cricket once and for all?",73

Pollard is just Dhoni minus the flack,9

Pollard is part of the take it deep gang!,1
Smart playing for NRR,2
When will MI get rid of pollard? 2050?,5
Nice Udana. Don't choke in your last over please,9
Ohhh God that paint ad from Dhoni is unwatchable.,4
mind you chahal still has 2 overs,8
The difference between current rate vs required rate is like Rohit's Away average vs Home average in Tests,13
Polly can still do it. Big dick energy.,2
Wish my gf was as pretty as Zampa,16

##**COMMENCE OPERATION NRR**,2
Even year MI. Nothing to see here guys,2
Is Steyn not playing due to rest? form? or conditions?,3
I feel like dew is affecting batting more than bowling these days,2
Even people's criticism of MI's approach contains embedded criticism for Dhoni.,6
Pollard and Ishan batting like they're waiting for Tewatia's spirit to descend into them.,3
Anytime MI,5
"So Mumbai Indians pays 63% more to Krunal Pandya than to Keiron Pollard. And he's the third most paid behind Rohit and Hardik.  

butwhy.jpg",10
That legstump tactics is working so far,3
Tewatia left handed. Ishan is left handed too. I cracked it bois.,2
"At this point, Pollard is a mascot for MI for sake of nostalgia",16
Is this a tactic by RCB,3
"we making csk feel less shit about their ""chase"" from the other day! brothers in arms always :)",9
Seems like Pollard is playing to get batting practice,7
I honestly thought Udana was a spinner until I saw him in this game.,9
These rcb chants are annoying,2
Rarely has Mumbai been completely  outclassed like this. RCB look real good,3
CPL MVP,2
"I can understand pumping in the crowd noise, but do they really have to play the RCB chant as well?",4
AB gonna do everything this time. Koach please try to compensate 17 Cr.,4
lol dafuk is pollard doing tuktuk for. they need 18 runs per over and pollard looks least bit concerned,4
It's hard for Mumbai when Umesh and Dube aren't bowling for RCB. Unfair,9
Kohli is gonna be fined again,7
Abd is lighting quick behind stumps. Yes quicker than dhoni.,1
Krunal Pandya is just an elaborate money laundering scheme. CMV!,12
RRR is 18 ffs. what are they even doing rn?,6
"They’re not even covering quantum of loss, just having a net",3

Zampa seems to have great control on where he pitches the ball,7

Why isn't Pollard targeting spinners?,6
Can the fake rcb chants stop pls..,8
"Big wicket, Pollard coming to the crease now, no chance of winning till Pollard is out, no ground is big enough for him.",10
Worst MI have played in quite a while,4
Every dot ball is increasing the RRR by 1rpo now,7
Gotta feel for those guys who spent the whole weekend preparing memes on Rcb for today's match,42
Anju and Murli jeeez stfu! I am paying for this shit :(,12
"Why doesn't Pollard, the biggest batsman, simply eat Kishan?",40
horrible tuk tuk wtf is MI doing,3
I don't think this is gonna be competitive,0
Kishan using every ounce of his energy in his sixers.,8
Csk got close because it was in Sharjah. On this ground you can't simply hit sixes so don't know what MI are planning here.,4
"Ummi Anna is not there , we can win",7
"Have a doubt, during a run out if all three stumps are removed

And then if batsman runs again, how do you get him out?",7
Still feels too little too late. This ground is too big for us to pull off a Tewatia,10
Beautiful,2
"Oh boy, Tiwari never actually deserved playing over Ishan Kishan.",6
"Decent knock from Kushan, he has done nothing wrong this innings",6
The match is gone but well played Ishan,7
Wtf RCB were just 12 runs ahead at this point?,9
 RCB fans are still worried...,6
Mark nicholas: I'm not paid enough to listen to this shite,6
Kishan giving everything that he has.,5
26 run over incoming,4
anyone else watching from US with WFH mode on.,2
At least Kishan is a silver lining today for MI.,10
"well played kishan.

now get out pls.",10
RCB looks so good when they don't have Dube as their death bowler .....,6
Thank God MI chose Kishan over Tiwary,6
Cred ads trying to be too clever by half. Just like their product,4
"I feel we just might see a Dhawan special tomorrow, fingers crossed",-2
How were rcb only ahead by 12? Abd is a beast,9
Idk why Pollard reminds me of Heimdall,7
RCB hit so many sixes today. Can’t wait for them to play in Sharjah,6
God damn Anjum Chopra commentary is so infuriating. Rather listen to Sanju Manju and bleed my ears to death.,2
Chris Morris got a fresh haircut and fresh shave just to carry water bottles.,9
Josh gang bang,3
I think MI/Rohit like to have a core team of players play together for several seasons. That's why they keep retaining Pollard.,2
Yesterdays match should have humbled you guys. Calm down and let the professional players play the game.,4
Best part is that RCB learnt something from previous match and made tough decisions,10
"rcb v kkr at sharjah lol, will be interesting game",5
Guys hear me out while rcb is one of the greatest chokers in ipl. Kxip has got to be the greatest bottlers in the league. The amount of time their bowlers have given up the game at death overs is a fact which I have noticed just recently.,3
They do know that the rrr is 17?,2
Gonna lose by 30-40 runs today,1
Not worth risking AB by making him keep. Bring parthiv in place of Gurkeerat,2
If wasn't there was a tewatia show yesterday i would have called this off by now and abused the shit Outta Mi,5
Tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk Mumbai going tuk tuk tuk tuk,3
Who ate Zaheer Khan?! 😯,2
Atleast mumbai's best players are in the pavilion because they are dismissed.,5
Pollard we need one of those special annual innings now,6
Okey. MI fans lets move on to the next match! We have no business here.,3
"Why are people shitting on Tiwari so much? The man did what he was sent to do

Highest run scorer against csk

Came out to give strike to rohit against kkr, hit a 4, a 6 and got out trying to strike the ball again. Nothing bad at all about what he did",13
holy shit. zak let himself go a little.,1
"Big franchise games, MI, RCB, CSK and KKR have been dull. Historically second tier ones like RR, DC, KXI have been the more interesting ones to watch.",5

This is the OVER,1
Lord umesh is my MoM for not playing,12
Kishan vs KL vs Pant vs Sanju. Arrgh great dilemma to have,5
"If the fat uncles Ambani and Srini Maama don't do something real soon, we are in deep trouble MI brothers.",8
I feel Kishan's gonna die for the cause in this over,6
Only Pollard can win it for us from here,1
So who’s gonna produce the 5 sixes in an over this match?,4
Ishan kishans hair 😘,4
[deleted],8
well we did get about 105 in the last six,3
Someone tell Pollard to hit it or gtfo,1
Good tactics yuzi,1
I feel like I've brought a joint from Chahal some years ago,11
"This IPL has had some good moments but has been weird to watch. Conditions are odd with spongey pitches but small outfields (except for this one). And the players have been in various degrees of form/match fitness, most look like they are not completely ready for competitive cricket

Kohli should cool it,3

100ish runs in 5 overs.,1
"I know this is said about ALL wicket keeper batsmen, but Kishan's backlift and swing is actually a bit like Gilly.",2
"Kohli shouting at misfield/dropped catches irritates me so much.

Someone needs to do the same to you.",13
Kohli mixing up Shivam Dube with Ben Stokes,4
"The prodigal son of cricket subreddit, Kohli, is playing worse then their sworn enemy Dhoni...",8
Probably lost the ball in the circular ring of lights.,4
Kishan's been totally brilliant too tough competition at Wicketkeeping spot,2
Tiwari to be fair played well in one match. But Kishan has a higher ceiling and should always play ahead of him,2
2 fours this innings lol,-1
"Yeah, fuck off, Kohli. You've been contributing NOTHING all IPL to your team.",9
Cmon Kohli cut the young guy some slack..you literally dropped the KL twice couple of days ago,8
thank you ishan for fighting when it mattered,2
Kissan is taking revenge of farmers.,6
Ishan taking his brothers revenge,2
All of India’s future prospects are batting well while our current players are shitting the bed big time,11
I am pretty sure that is my first Koach behnchod of the year...,5
Lady Commentator: Never judge anything by height,22
Noone mentioned his height all day. Stfu,3
Fucking Kohli. Dropped KL twice and lost the match. He has no right absuing Dube for that.,16
"No disrespect to him, but Bangar really needs to work on his English. Does good analysis but takes way too much time to construct his sentences with a lot of fillers. May be with time he will improve.",8

I'm scared.,2
I ain't feeling good RCB bois. The next 5 overs are looking bleak. Saini hasn't been good today,4
Don't understand why you'd get Saini on now.,1
RCB can still lose this,-1
"Navdeep Saini [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack

90 runs in 30 balls. Required rate has touched 18


Somehow that makes me happy and sad at the same time.",2

Slowly but surely Kishen is building a good score for himself,1
What are the chances that Malinga comes back next year and still has a spot on the team?,4
Pls don't lose,2
"Ishaan has become so mature , he was dyslexic as a kid",9

Ghosts of death over bowling are gonna haunt RCB again. This match is far from over.,2
Unlucky with that first delivery imo,9
"Who is the lady commentator?
Isha Guha?",0
90 needed from 30. Pity there's no Yadav and Siraj,1
RCB is gonna shit the bed here right?,2
Kishan well done boi but get out now,2
They are still talking about the dimensions of the ground 😂,1
Why Dube and Gurkeerat didn't bowl,1
"Dube to Koach: Sirf mereko ""BC"" kyu bola BC?",5
It’s clear ABD won’t be able to keep for the next 10 or so games. RCB has to bring in Parthiv but sacrifices need to be made elsewhere. He’s going to have to replace either Finch or Padikkal and play as an opener. Or replace Dube (if he’s not bowling) and play as a floater/finisher.,6
"Sorabh tiwari was not fit.

You don't say.",5
The fact that they need 90 in 5 overs and I’m still scared af as an rcb fan says a lot,15
"if RCB loses from here, I have no hopes for them!",14
the fact that everyone is expecting an RCB choke just shows how bad they have been in the past,10
RR needed 63 off 23 when Samson got out yesterday. This chase looks even steeper from this point on.,10
Ghungroo toot gye,6
"Ishan takes one on the balls. 

Oh no RCB in danger :(",5
What is wrong with Saini? Guy looks like a pale shadow pf himself,3

"Bowler concedes 1 boundary.

R/cricket : is this our new principal of the Dinda academy?",21

Gurkeerat has neither batted nor bowled,11
Kishan taking one from the finch playbook there.. too late fella,3

Right in the kishan kanhaiya babymakers. Oof!,4
Star showing Tewatiya innings again for a super jinx lmao,7

dube pig doesnt even want to run,4
Anjum seems a bit irritated by Kartik's endless flurry of questions.. LOL!,6
We need a Washi over again,6
We need a new academy where the world’s best batsmen get out for an embarrassingly low score,7
Dube is athletic but fields like a fat guy,61
Koach must be MAD at Dube,8
Smart bowling from Saini,3
Anyone noticed Dube in fielding takes initial 3 secs just to react!,9

This is impossible why am I still watching,3
"i hope they play the ""hardik not hard enough"" comment from the commentator over and over and over to hardik to whip him back to form.",7
"With Dhoni finally out of the picture. Selecting WK for Indian team is an interesting task. 

Surely for Home tests it is Saha.

Away tests: Pant (provided he stops that shuffling to left movement he does before every ball)

ODI is where things get tough. KL as WK? Or Pant? Or should a newcomer like Ishan/Samson* be given a go?

Who is winning guys?,3
"Pollard was done at least 3 years ago, yet remains an automatic starter for Mumbai because in one game he will hit some 6s",4
this over better be really big. or it's over for MI,1
"Hard to fault Ishan here. It's a fairly brisk innings (SR 146), he just hasn't had any support whatsoever.",4
Sundar's 4 overs won the game for RCB,12
Is rcb fielding 5 Negi's?,8
Good redemption by Saini,2
pollard isnt the same anymore...this is his last year,3
Test Cricket is best Cricket.,1
Inb4 Kohli comes out of bowling retirement and gives us flashbacks of Albie.,3

Totally achievable,1
"Rohit Sharma at the presentation: To beat CSK, you have to become CSK.",5

it'd be great to get a win by over 50runs atleast,3
"Tewatia's moved the goalposts of what can be expected from the last 4 - 5 overs of a T20... guy probably doesn't realize what he's done yet, but his knock will be talked about years from now..",5

I have a feeling zampa is gonna get fucked now,5
That MI can still hope is because of the Tewatia effect,1

Its amazing when it is not your team how clearly you can see that both Dhoni and Pollard are consistently shit right now.,3

All RCBs gotta do now is to not play their natural game,8
Kishan should get his 100.,2
Polly is gonna do a thala with big hitting in last over to compensate on NRR,2
Adam Zampa is proof that even white people have runts,1
Tewatia has made it hard for everyone trying to criticize the underperforming player.,9

4 years ago Negi became the second highest paid player in IPL history and today he cant make it into RCB XI,2
big fucker moment,2
Umesh kabse spin karne lag gaya :) /s,2

Kohli bowling a leggy in the 17th over. Not great tbh,2
Chahal was just fine last over. Why would Zampa be better,1
"Caught 3 catches with the indian way and drops one with the foreign.

SunnyG doesn't forget to point that out.

Classic SunnyG.",4
im afraid this is too little and too late.,2
Booooo 2 runs... What is this a fuckin test match?,4
Nita Ambani has used the Tewatia curse on Negi and Zampa.,6
Anjum Chopra  has the sense of humor of a dead rat stuck behind the refrigerator.,7
Discount Chahal getting discounted :-(,3
"Yesterday RR scored 86 runs in last 4 overs, MI have similar ask ...can they do it",7
This is what I was dreading.,6
Oh man that desperation in his call for two said it all.,4
RCB choke™ incoming :(,9
Still less than rrr,3
Here we go let's get a game on,3
I feel like dube should've been bowled earlier so they wouldn't have to bowl spinners at the death,1
2019 Russell PTSD intensifies.,7

Ye lo.. Net run rate half hogya 😂,8

Every ground is Sharjah when you're built like Pollard,7

"Look at me, I am Tewatia now",15
"If you can't defend 80 in 4 overs, I don't have much to say anymore.",10
TARAMANDAL,4
Pro tip: don't give the 17th over to a spinner.,10
Haaahahahahahaha kill me,13
Zampa kohli rift confirmed,3
I just can't,1
What are the chances we see a pollard vs virat feud?,1
Pollard has always done it against RCB,3
"I love it when reddit literally shits on the same players over and over again and then jumps ship when surprisingly, they aren’t dog shit.",8
Zampa getting Tewatiyed,2
I’ve never seen so many 30 run overs,4
Catch drop. Nice,2
My god bro. Where do you pitch the ball to this guy?,3
Nooooooo stop hurting us :(,5

Keiron Pollardia,3

27... fuck,3
Lord Umesh > Lord Zampa. RCB things smh.,7
Fucking hell they are gonna do it,2
RCB channelling it’s true nature now.,6

Another leg spinner over remaining,2

RCB IS BACK IN THE GAME BOIS,4
FUCK MY LIFE,10
Fielding still disappointing us,3
rcb coming into form,8
MI gonna win now,2
RCB back to RCBing.,9
Fuck Chahal's fielding.,6
"Zampa 🤝 Pattinson

Joining the half century gang",4
Chahal has always been a shit fielder,5
Kohli to bowl 19th over,3
Nah. Don't give me hope,2
Yuzi will get Pollard next over.,2
you can take Umesh out of RCB but you can't take Umesh out of RCB,4
Yesterday was 51 of 3 overs. Now 53,5
good luck rcb,5
"Not again, not again, not again",3
KL dropped twice; Pollard dropped twice.,4
"Indian fielders chutiye hi rahenge.

PS: No offence to the extraordinary Jadega.",3
RCB bought Pollard back to form,3
Zampa gets a half century.,3
"RR needed 51 from 18 last night

MI need 53 from 18 now

This is spicyyyyyyyy",10
RCB so good at throwing games.,6
classic rcb bacc in game,4
Dube is a fuck all fielder,3
RCB still in front though,3
Common can still defeat RCB,2
Now this is the RCB I know.,3
"Ohh fuck this shit.

RCB will remain meme team",5
53 in 18 is def doable,4
[deleted],8
WHYYYYYY 😭,2
"Bring on Udana, Dube, Saini",3
"Were wer u when zampa was kil?



I was at home watching IPL when fone ring


'Zampa is kil'

Why can't we ever have an easy win ffs?,3
r/fucknegi,1
"Massive

"3 of the last, nicee!",2
53 off 18. FFS!,4
David Miller PTSD intensifies,3
It won’t be rcb games without a shitshow,1
They are reusing the same script,5
RCB is kill? I hope not.,3
No god please no no nooooo!!!!!!!,5
lmao I honestly love kohli for not killing these fuckers,7
Please a 20 run over,1
"Pollard is the one player you cannot drop, omg. This can be so costly.",2
Pls don't tell me Yuzi gonna bowl an over after this,2
If only this was Sharjah.,1
One relatively easy chance and other made it look difficult. RCB doing their best to get MI in the game.,3
Should have been caught twice in that over,3
"If Pollard can do this in Dubai to RCB bowlers, what would Russell do to them in f-ing SHARJAH?",5
No one told me KXIP is playing today also,2
Man how much has sehwag aged,2
Zampa got it rough,3
"guys, off-topic but check out /r/all :

>Multiple 'water bodies' found under surface of Mars",4
Anyone but Saini.,1
"Rcb and throwing games, name a better duo",2
"AB in the field would’ve been the difference today, perhaps Partiv should keep next game?",1
RCB: *miss me?*,2
Yesterday RR needed 52 of 18 balls. Today MI need 53.,5
"The moment pressure is put, RCB starts cracking!!

Jeez!! Get a grip.",3
Oh fuck it's Yuzi,3
"Ambani has quickly opened Paytm and sent some quick cash to the RCB management

&#x200B;

please dont downvote, its a joke",3
Perfect time for Kohli to bowl,3
RCB gonna RCB,2
Koach himself should bowl now. Only way to win. Or bring Finch’s left arm bullshit.,2
"Come on, this is 2020. RCB will find a way.",1
Kieron Tewatia coming in big here,2
Who is negi Feilding for?,1
"I really don't have much faith left, with Udana, Saini and Chahal left",2
Kohli give me an over,1
"Only RCB could lose it from this stage, lmao",1
I want to jump off my window but I am on the ground floor. Fml.,2
Rcb need to take a break. Just call the team for a quick huddle. Tell them to calm down.,1
I feel for Zampa. Two catches missed in the over and a misfield. This game could have been done with in the 17th.,6
Keeping spinners for the end is gonna come back and bite koach in the ass,3
"It's not hard hitting Yuzi, tbh. Unlike other leggies, he's predictable af. He keeps on banging leg spinners as wide as he can, from the off stump.",3
My PTSD from yesterday is triggering,3
"Saini, Udana, chahal?",1
Get 30 in this over and its game on!,1
Chahal is too smart to go for 20+ and not take any wickets.,2
"Did AB just say, 'Douchebag' ?",1
"Yuzi? Kohli honey, what is you doing?",1
Kohli going with Chahal! Brave or stupid?,2
Rcb will lose. Chahal and udana will go for 20 each,1
Kohli can't catch a break ever. His bowling will always fail him and sometimes his batting.,2
Feel like De Villiers needs to take over the captaincy at this rate,4
"Pokes RCB: Meme CB. C'mon, give us another RR vs KXIP",2
How the fuck do we always lose lmao,4
"Ban batriarchy. I don't know how to.

The ground is already big.",4
"DO IT KISHAN BOI, GIVE US ANOTHER MEME GAME",3
"Real RCB showing fake RCB how its done. Gave ""just"" 27 and 2 drops",5
Dube should’ve been given that over,2
It's still tough but it's us,5
Helter skelter!,3
One more similar over like the last over ..MI will take this,3
I heard they don't have a bowler to bowl 20th,6
clearly rcb arent pro enough to be some imposter that isn't obvious throughout for even one match,8
Kohli 11 ball 3 might come back to hunt now,10
LEG SPINNER? LMFAOO GET FUCKED KOHLI,5
Oh my fucking god,2
God dammit. Terrible Virat captaincy at it again,5
Yeah RCB is finished,2
wtf virat.,6
Pollard isn't finished.,5
Vintage Pollard,7
This is bullshit!,2
I'm done with this team till Kohli leaves it,6
RCB pulling RCB,4
Does MI have a chance???,3
Why do u ball spinner now wtf,2
im in two mind. idk if i want them to go hell for leather or play it safe and save nrr.,2
Big man against the little fella.,2
"Dont panic, Udana will be our saviour.",2
"Polly, it's Chahal next ball take run. Gavaskar will be happy too.",1
RCB never ceases to amaze with their bottling ability 😂,3
loooooooooooooooooollllllllllllllllllllllll,0
Pollard with his annual match winning knock? Please God!,3
No hopes of defending this total with the kind of death over bowlers we have,1
"Main madarchod hoon jo iss mein aaya!

T: Why do I subject myself to this every RCB game!",9
#🤴🏽☠🏙,1
Big Tewatia energy,3
Chahal wicket incoming I feel it,3
That 3(11) is gonna haunt RCB.,2
RCB doing an RCB here. LMAO,7
get RCB'd,4
Oh my fucking lord as God as my witness,3
~~Pollard~~ Faulad,4
"Maybe they should consider turning the gigantic electronic billboards off while the ball is in play.

Might improve catching.",3
Why the FUCK WOULD YOU BOWL LEG SPINNERS RIGHT NKW,3
Wtf is happening,2
What a big Dick SIX!!! Pollard what a playaaa,3
"wtf, stop bowling spin to pollard",3
[deleted],7
No spinners at this stage!,2
Can't wait for Pollard to play at the cornfield in Sharjah.,8
Lmao,1
"  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that RCB will not be contained. RCB breaks free, it expands to new territories, and crashes through barriers painfully, maybe even dangerously, but, uh, well, there it is. RCB finds a way to lose.",7
Lmao RCB doing RCB things,3
STAND AND FUCKIN DELIVER.,2
Kohli slowly losing his sanity,5
Pack your bags. Even Chahal can't save us now.,2
Pollard doesn’t read the spinners at all. Easy wicket for Chahal,3
8 sixes in 17 balls doesn't seem too hard...,3
T20 is a joke.,3
"Guys I am getting September 27, 2020 flashbacks",8
Could have used Dube in middle somewhere,2
Pollard flies ✈️,2
This is why I don't understand bowling Saini when he did. That should have been Dube instead.,2
Pollard giving last hopes for MI fan's.,7
Hahaha the day rcb let's kohli go is when their fortune will turn.,6
How is he hitting sixes on demand???? WOW,10
BENCHOOO STOP IT :(,5
"Even when Umesh doesn’t play, his spirit plays.",10
"Are there no depths Kohli won't go to to lose RCB a match?

First with bat, now with captaincy",2
Holy fuck another loss,6
Don't lose this RCB!! Please!!,2
Pollard running 2s because fuck RCB I guess,1
Meroko toh aisa Dhak dhak ha raha hai,3
"Dread it

Run from it




MI arrives all the same",3
Every single Australian has scored a half-century this game.,5
Polly kaka kashala gand martos,1
why would u pput in an another leg spinner,1
Pls rcb do it for the memes!!,5
"I don't blame spinners ,Koach shoulda saved pacers",7
We're fucked.,5
RCB highly badly fuckingly cursed in the death overs.. Smh,4
This is the reason you should bowl your spinners out before death overs. Poor captaincy Koach.,9
Guys please just please,14
Fuck pawan negi and virat koach.,2
At least NRR damage is reduced,3
So far so good by Chahal,3
"I want the pain I felt yesterday to be felt by RCB today...

But then again, nobody can experience the pain RCB fans feel every time their team walks on the field!",2
Just 3 good balls yuzi please,1
Don't think Udana would get smashed around as badly as zamps.  He's pretty quality,1
Pollard has been doing russell stuff for a long time now.,2
Seriously what else can RCB do to actually win matches and the tournament. It is getting really difficult to spare time for this team.,2
"What has tewatia done ? His knock has instilled confidence in everyone that they can chase off 80 odd in the last 4 overs..

Look at the body language of Pollard and kishan",5
Time for Udana to be the hero,1
rcb can't win one fuckin match convincingly,1
45 runs in 16 balls is so doable. Udana has to show up.,2
"It's gonna come down to 6 off 1 and Pollards gonna hit a 4, missing the boundary by half a metre",6
Chehre pe shikan,1
Koach was so confident that he got spinners to bowl at the death,3
Umesh is playing as imposter,3
Fuck Pollard. All my homies hate pollard,2
Why not give dube an over instead of spinners in death?,2
"I really feel for RCB fans. Behind that meme team defense, there must be real pain.",3
"Kohli playing the first half of tewatia innings

Pollard playing the second half",5
This is painful to watch as a RCB fan,1
"It's raining combs in Negi's house!

(according to a superstition: comb falls from hands when people think about you)",3
Koach don't fuck this up pls,3
Everyone this sub memes ends up performing,2
"Gavaskar: There is no such thing as 'impossible'

Om jai jagadeesh hare swami jai jagdeesh hare 🙏🙏,7
Why isn't Kohli bowling Dubey?,6
SRH never gets games like this. We don’t have a finisher. Our openers either finish the game early or the entire team shits the bed.,3
Focusing on Siraj. The producer knows what he's doing lmao.,6
RCB DEATH BOWLING CURSE,7
"If this was CSK chase, we could have all watched singles peacefully. No BP issues. Think about it.",11
Could have brought Dubey ji.,1
RCB and shitty death bowling - name a more iconic duo.,6
Russell had Pollard's poster on his wall when he was a kid.,6
My stomach is churning,8
RCB finding ways to make this interesting.,3
Goodnight imma cry myself to sleep,4
Ish Kish you lil beast,1
Now imagine rohit or someone doing a half decent job at the top and this could have been so much closer.,1
Why is Koach not bowling their Right Arm Quick?,1
Fuck it I'm done. Bye.,3
Kek. RCB can’t win for shit,1
Nah man fuck this,3
Kishan you sexy legend,4
Sam Curran in the purple hat list has me at full mast,1
how is the ground big enough to run easy twos and small enough to clear the fence with ease,4
ಥೂ ನನ್ ಮಕ್ಳ,4
now Kishan HHAHAHAHAHAHAH classic RCB choke,2
"Fucks sake man this is definitely lost, no way udana and saini defend this when zampa gets stonked for 27",2
Holy shit,1
These guys fucking suck dude,3
i’ll give chahal a dirty wank if he doesnt bowl his remaining over like shit wait what,3
"I thought this was gonna be a snoozefest, thank the lord this is getting exciting at the end",3
could this end up like that game against kkr last year?,3
Hmmmmmmm,2
To think that Pollard had become a commentator!   Age blah blah.... it's all the state of mind. Hope our legend no 7 makes up his mind to go bang bang!,4
Holy fuck finally someone cleared that boundary,3
"Even if we loose the match, i am happy with how we batted.",1
"Nothing new to see here, kids. Just your annual Chahal Massacre.",5
Kohli has only himself to blame,4
"RCB should write fuckin book on ""How to fuck up every single match""",7
Happening status: Its,5
Overs 17 -20 are stick cricket overs.,11
Why would you bowl two spinners in the 17th and 18th overs ?,5
Tewatia is the most impactful player in IPL history,8
Fuck this. Why can't we ever have a peaceful match with RCB?,8
saini's last gonna be crucial,5
Bowl Udana. Now.,6
What the fuck? Don't tell me you can't defend 80 of last 4,3
It's always fun to see rcb getting screwed. Koach looks like Dasterdly from wacky races with chahal as muttley.,3
this is so sad. all i wanted was one win without any slip-ups or having a hint of doubt. why give so many false hopes each time dude?,4
Is Delhi playing tomorrow? Samson and noe Kishan. Guess its Pant time soon.,3
Can't believe rcb still has fans left lol,18
"Amazing. But still little late I think.

I hope not though",10
Why...just why,7
"Mistimes the ball from a spinner, goes for six.

Just tells the luck of RCB",9
"Man imagine being an rcb fan for 10+ years
Edit: i am only 16",20
Short and wide my prediction,2
"I'm convinced at this point RCB exists solely to remind no matter how bad it gets, you'll never have it as bad as RCB fans",9
Are we 20 runs short again. FML.,5
"This is why you don't bowl spinners in the last 4, no matter how good they might be. 

Even mishits clear the field. 

Just poor captaincy, really.",3
Is chahal afraid of the ball? Does someone sense that?,5
CAMAAAAAAAAN,3
Never ever doubt the possibility of RCB losing. Ever.,14

Being Mumbai Fan i am feeling bad for RCB. Weird?!,2
Polly wants this so bad.,2
KOHLI IS THE WORST CAPTAIN IN THE IPL.,2
Kohli should seriously retire as captain,4
Damn we just needed 1 decent over at the top and this could have been won. Fabulous entertainment though. Kudos to both Polly and Kishu for a splendid show. In vain but splendid nevertheless!,2
Watching RCB crush my hopes like...,3
30 of 2 overs...very gettable with Pollard and Kishan set.,2
Seriously. Fuck Kohli's innings and fuck this captaincy. He used up and Udana over earlier when he could have snuck in another over of spin,4

Not playing at the Chinnaswamy but RCB must be feeling at home. Trying to lose a game that had been won by poor death bowling at a proven finisher’s peril.,2
Spinners ko over dedo back.to back poora momentum bana do match jitane ke.liye,3
That's enough cricket for me today. Time has come to disband this team for the sake of IPL's future,5

Some old story,3

Time to call Anushka for last over /s,2
Is Udana the only Sri Lankan this IPL?,4
You can stop someone like Pollard with Yorkers and Yorkers only. Ocassional slower balls might do the trick as well. But Length and Over pitched balls are strict No No against such players.,3
"RCB, or more accurately Kohli, has not learned a single thing in last decade or so.",5
22 off Zampa and 27 off Chahal. Two LOI leg spinners against Pollard.,4
Appreciate Chahal.. Wow!,5

Quartine only applys if you are poor it seems.,4
Kohli's so gonna be trolled after this,2
Who's the girl supporting RCB,5
24 from the last over and Pollard does a Carlos?,5
Kohli's telling Siraj he's playing next game which is why Siraj looked so disgusted/shocked,9
Who's that girl,6
Maaro bc,2
Good work Saini . Keep it up,6
Saini out here un-memeing himself,13
Saini bowling good,4
"Good ball, Saini, under pressure.",3
I'm so nervous for Udana,7
52 off the last 14 balls holy,4
RCB need to start from a clean slate when the mega auction happens.,2
Fantastic bowler my man Saini is.,6
Saini bowling with more brains than Bumrah did,2
Dube bowling would’ve been better than Chahal,2
Well bowled!! Now 3 more good balls!!,1
We should be safe now.,0
Don't give me hope,2
Absolute class over this so far.,5
This is where mumbai is missing Umesh,13
Yeah now MI aren’t winning this.,3
That's the game I guess. Good try boys,1
Nice Yorker man.. 3 more to go,1
"Kishan looks exhausted now, it's all on Pollard",3
Anything more than 15 off last over is difficult,0
missing lungi and cottrell today.,2
Saini is good,1
Saini keeping it solid.,1
Lol that graph shows basically bowl anywhere it's death.,2
This is probably over now,1
Was that Swara Bhasker in the audience?,1
Well Bumrah went for runs today as well. Not sure why Saini or Udana won't.,0
"Camera pans to attractive woman

This thread: who dat",10
Unless the rrr goes 36+ I have no choice but to doubt,8
Excellent over this so far,2
"Fuckin hell MI, don’t lose it now",1
4 sixes in 9 ball's definitely possible,3
Man Saini is so bad can't even get a wicket for ffs,-1
Should have just slipped in one over in middle with dube.,1
I'll jerk off to chahal if we win,5
Saini single-handedly saving RCB's ass,8
"Kohli should start praying, that's his best bet!",4
Guys who is that woman?,7
There's no way MI winning. This is Hessons team.,-3
Lol even virat knows rcb bowlers can fuck up any score,4
We have no chance of winning the WC with this guy as a Captain.,10
go Rcb you can do it,1
"Tight finish in store. 

/r/cricket : WHO IS THAT GIRL IN WHITE??",15
Two boundaries needed in the last three balls this over I’d say,3
I remember some dude on this thread called it... It would come to a narrow end point and then we look back at that 3(11) score...,4
I think Virat has a cold,2
"Saini has some fucking talent, could bowl really fast balls, now has the line and length. Really hope can be a regular for the national team.",3
Ohh Saini you’re a godsend.,4
Bowlers should be allowed to retire with a baby over,5
Will Kohli surprise us all and give Dube the last over?,2
Remember the Yorker barrage in the last 10 overs against the Aussies by Bumrah and Saini. Seems like Bumrah has forgotten how to bowl yorkers now,1
There is hope!,2
Dang Saini got in a nice over.,3
Saini saving rcb,5
I'm still not sure if Udana can defend this.,5
I know I'm an MI supporter but really can't hate an Indian guy bowling fast. Nice fucking job Saini.,10
saini ftw,3
Where's lord siraj when u need him?,6
2 more good balls please!!,7
"game over, dudebros.",7
Terrific so far,7
[POLLARD](https://i.imgur.com/hvGhuKQ.gif),1
Excellent stuff man.. 2 more,1
Saini the goat,1
Finally we saw Mann,1
I don't think RCB will lose this but why tf would any captain pick spinners to bowl to Pollard in last overs?,2
Saini>>> Bumrah,4
You can do it Saini!,2
Superb over this by Saini in the circumstances.,3
Good job Saini!,3
That was a fulltoss Pollard,1
"So far, great over by Saini.",6
[removed],11
RCB gonna win by 7 runs,1
"i thought RCB packed today with death bowlers. making 200+.  
Making ABD keep and if they still lose dont know what to say!",3
Need 2 sixes this over,2
31 off 2 was finally looking like a doable score. Great over by Saini,5
"Change captain, make ABD the captain can't do worse than Virat",3
Guys who is that girl?,6
[removed],16
Saini is so cool under pressure.,3
Krunal Pandya looks like a fucking villain man,5
Saini can't get the line right if he crosses 140 kmph wtf,3
Ishan got in a BIG DICK six,1
An amazing six...,1
Should have stop that,1
"I don’t understand.

Why did RCB even choose Gurkeerat Singh Mann if he neither batted nor bowled?",3
Out,1
That six...,2
This is another meme match,4
"What a ridiculous shot, thought that will be caught",2
Pollard was 10 from 10,6
Kholi is such an hunter he tries for wicket every over before death overs and at the final he shuffles everyone available even if they are spinners. It's an extremely aggressive strategy but useful if your team can backup.,1
All this because Koach decided to use spinners in the death,8
"Saini with 4 good balls and then that

Last ball of the over cannot go for a boundary",5
"Saini taketh, Saini giveth",10
Ichu kichu got levers,5
Oooooooooooooooo,3
I want a super over,3
Saini backwards = Inais = I nice,7
Imagine if Sundar hadn't bowled that outstanding spell of his.,4
Why full toss?,2
WTF thought that was out,2
Kohli on a roll boys,1
Oof this is gonna go down to last ball methinks,1
Fuck no this can't be happening,1
RCB 🤝 Choking in the death overs,7
Royal Challengers Bangalore™,1
At least push it in if you can’t catch it jeez,0
 PolLORD,4
20 to win off the last over I back MI,3
Obligatory Faf would have caught that,5
The spirit of Tewatia is not here,3
How does Kishan generate so much power?,2
Guys do we have a small fucking chance??????,2
6 or 4 here will make things interesting,2
I can understand why Kohli is depressed now,3
Why is that guy's mask hanging by a thread?,2
Ah kishan was loosening up Saini I guess for four balls,3
This is MI's game to win now. Big last over this for Udana.,6
Hardik Pandya in the dugout is pumped up,4
"not the point, but that chris morris mustache is shiteee.",6
Udana mindvoice realizing he has to bowl last over as RCB: Shit shit shit shit shit shit,36
who is middle one in dugout?,1
[removed],20
"I swear if any of the SRH youngsters plays an innings like Kishan did today, I will shave my head.",12
Pollard wasted too many balls early on. Game over now,3
Kohli is no Pooran,10
Only if Pooran was out there.,5
VK couldn't pull out a Pooran.,6
"this is worse than a CSK loss, atleast CSK is never in the game",7
Rohit's reaction to that six was everyone in 2020,3
Pressure on Udana now. Man all of Sri Lanka is with you brother!,24
"This is why Moeen Ali looked sad when he was being interviewed earlier

He saw this coming",38
"When RCB bowls, even mishits reach boundaries",9
"I don't even wanna troll Kohli no more, i just feel sad for him now",36
This is gonna be interesting,6
Kohli needed to do a pooran there,3
Feel bad for RCB still losing after a good batting score.,10
"Saini, fuck shit up. Go! 
One Yorker and game over.",4
Kishan close to a 100,4
"IPL 2020, where every match that CSK is not playing is exciting.",19
Slow over rate..,5
The game regardless of the result is why RCB aren’t one of the top teams for the title.,9
"Ah man tough luck for saini, scholarship canceled at dinda academy",7
Pooran > Kohli,6
Gavaskar really enjoying this,10
Everything rests on udana now,6
"RCB is gonna RCB. Good score up front, decent start and then screw it up.",5
19 of 6,1
MI with Adrenaline > RCB with nerves.,7
Commentators love nothing more in this sport than the chance of a super over I swear,14
Almost a good over.,3
I'd back MI to win this. Too much pressure on Isuru. A couple of sixes and it's in the bag.,2
Why Rohit making pig faces?,2
1 run is a bad result,3
Moeen the prophet.,10
Come on Koach. Bowl for the memes.,10
Isuru plz,4
"19 off 6

Really could go either way",6
I want super over,1
Really good bowling under pressure from Saini,2
If rcb loses this then rcb fans are gonna be bullied for years,6
Pooran >> Koach,4
Can Udana defend 19??,1
wow the commentator just lowkey sprinkling salt there,3
Lara is good 🙂,1
The anxiety!!! Ughhh,1
19 off 6 balls. Fingers crossed.,1
Hope Csk players learn a thing or two from this chasing.,8
"Lara being a real gentleman and professional commentator there!

Respect",5
"Come on Udana, I didn’t know who you were before today but you gotta do this for me homie",8
19 needed from the last over.,1
MI be like: Where is Umesh?,1
Just 14 more runs,0
Cmon Udana,3
Oh Saini you’re a godsend.,1
Fuck needed Pollard on strike,3
I see a no ball in this over,1
Udana’s first game and RCB’s future in this season depends on his last over.,3
"Good over from Saini, Udana please do not fuck this up",7
12 runs isn’t that bad,1
is that dew or sweat factor ??,1
Let's go kishan,2
"Here we go, Classic RCB!",3
"It's definitely defendable, just 3 tight deliveries c'mon",3
My Fandom of kohli will get me killed one day. My heart can't take it anymore.,4
"Excellent over under pressure, Saini.",5

Osho Rajneesh: What the fuck is going on here??,0
"Damn it, that was a good over. GG RCB",1
"In the end, Kohli's 3 runs are going to make the difference. Kohli, the GOAT",5
May the spirit of /r/vinaykumar give you a miss Mr Udana,7
Udana please,3
Dube or Koach can make MI win.,1
I'd still back RCB to blow this,3
"Please, lord udana come in clutch",1
I think Saini saved the match,2
"Good over from Saini, apart from the 6. 19 of the last, with ~~Pollard~~ Kishan on strike..super over anyone?",1
Is there any way to sue IPL for my high blood pressure?,3
"PLEASE FUCK IT UP, GIROUD!",1
"It all comes down to the new bowler.   

For RCB.  

Uh.",2
"Udana to bowl the last over ?

Pollard will eat him alive with his pace lol",0
Isuzu can't stop this onslaught,1
RCB will win this,3
How is udana at the death?,1
I find too many who dat girl questions and not any answers,2
Fucking MI showing character as always. All their players turn up. Kishan is his first match unreal.,3
All things considered. That was a clutch over.,3
Feel 19 could be a bit of a stretch but this is genuinely in the balance,1
Should have picked moeen instead of zampa,2
"Man I have no idea how athletes do it, I’m straight up freaking out over here",3
Only 3 sixes needed. Easy Peasy,2
"Udana , bhaagwaan hai bhai",1
MI's game to lose,1
Kohli is coming in to bowl. He wants to take things into his own hands,2
"Zampa over is the only one which hurt RCB very badly.

Rest have been par with rrr",3
Scenes when RCB wins off the final ball and 3rd ump calls a no-ball and they lose it from there,3
Udana bowl a no ball or 5 wides please,1
Lord Dinda must be so proud. ❤️,2
Cmon udana your time to shine,2
Kohli is a really bad captain.,2
19 off the last six. Can Isuru Udana Tillakaratna take this home for RCB?,3
"Stick to the basics, avoid bowling extra balls and pray for the best.",2
Come on Sri Lankan Olivier Giroud!,3
If Mumbai wins it'll be much more fun,-1
RCB is going to win this.,2
Man they should charge kohli 50% for this delayed shit,2
Am I too optimistic in saying the chances are pretty much equal?,1
Udana coming with his cutter barrage.,1
So they need to score exactly what RCB scores in their last over. Nice symmetry.,3
I hope this match ties.,1
a No ball from Udana coming up in this over ..,2
At least the NRR won't be butchered for MI irrespective of the result.,1
"I'm still recovering from Dhoni vs. Umesh 2019, and we won that match",2

RCB is winning this one. Pollard is holing out.,1
Pls pls pls pls pls,1
FUUUUCKKKK,2
"If someone bowls 2 overs of spin at the death, he deserves to lose imo.",2
Out,1
Kishan gonna get 100 MI win,1
needed just 3 balls tewatia here,1
3 sixes and game over,1
"7 to get off the last ball, Pollard hits a 6 , super over time - bumrah to win it for MI",2
"Udhana might be like why the fuck did I join RCB, kill me already.",4
Polly on strike... That's what I want..,2
He's just saved I think,4
Your first match. Yeah no pressure mate,4
If CSK chases like this only then I will consider 2020 as freak year.,5
2 no balls here will be hilarious,1
"If this match had a slow over rate too, does that mean Kohli gets a bigger penalty? I read something like this in a thread",2
Birth of a new Lord today?,2
"Out boys

Edit: Oh so close",1
Ishan looks like he might pass out from the pressure.you did great man,1
"Oh damn, they're tired",4
Fuck me they resumed the broadcast when the ball had already reached the batsman,2
"Even if RCB have Malinga and Bumrah at death, they will still be able to concede 60 runs in last 4 overs by sheer will of choking.",3
That dive has saved us,3
That throw was slow!!,1
Can RCB ever win with a smile on their face? Always struggling till the last ball,6
Not out,1
Damn,1
Kishan no way,1
That looked out,1
That was a great first ball by Udana.,3
18 off 5 Pollard plz,2
"last 5 overs 90 required.

how can you lose from there?",3
"Eh, looked safe just from Udana's reaction",3
Pollard man remember the name,1
Temples of isuru udana to be constructed if he pulls this off.....,7
Kishan was tired anyway,6
Fuck,2
Excellent dive by Kishan,3
Now thats a sweeet textbook dive,7
"6 slow deliveries, got to be",4
Huge run there.,2
18 in 5 what do ya think bois,2
Excellent dive by Kishan!,0
Need a Carlos Braithwaite here,3
Pollard on strike fuck this is tense,3
Thank God its not Umesh!,3
He's in,1
Safe,1
Just three sixes,2
Kishan with a golden bat. So many chances,0
Guys who was that girl with the mask?,0
Even if RCB win this they will still be so deflated and stressed now.,0
I feel we'll only see three more deliveries in this game now,3

Lmao Kishan is so much smaller than Pollard. Comical to see them next to each other.,1

Grounded Grounded Grounded Grounded Grounded,5
All we need is 2 dot balls,4
I want Udana to defend this. Would get SL fans to cheer about something.,8
Now the important question is which players do MI retain for the mega auction. Only 3 retained and one RTM. Rohit and Pollard are aging but an icon. Which of the Pandya bros. Kishan has youth on his side and SKY has form. Bumrah is a guarantee. Can’t ignore Chahar either.,2
RCB giving everyone anxiety attacks,8
Sixhead>forehead,2
STRESSED,1
Full and wide outside off. Stack the offside.,1
Come on Polly,1

Holy shit why is sky sports showing fucking women’s cricket on every channel. What a joke,0

Not sure which team to root for.,1
"Was wide if he left it, right?",1

Welcome to IPL. The home of super overs.,1
Gotta feel for RCB.,2
"I have to say ... with everything that’s happened this year, this is what we need. IPL to bring a semblance of normalcy",2
This IPL is exceptional.,6
"Nah fam , diz shit is more predictable than Ekta kapoor serials .",4
fking lol RCB you're a meme jackpot,3
"IT’S A SUPER OVER

WE’RE GOING TO A SUPER OVER",3
Kohli literally does not care anymore,3
If only this was sharjah.. It would have gone to six,3
My heart is already on the ground oh god i have a test tomorrow,4
Saini's face says it all - what am i doing in this cursed team?,9
Bruh,2
T20 sPeCiaLiSt,3
RCB is shot virat is shit. I hate everyone who will let MI win.,3
Where's Finch. Haven't seen him for a while,3
"Okay RCB fans, time to open a bottle of RC and be. They have Bumrah.",8
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,2

Punjab watching this anxious so RCB take back their meme king spot back from Punjab,3
"The match which was in pocket, shitted by RCB.",3
This is still awesome. For Mumbai and neutrals,1
Ahaha what an ending! These last couple of games have really made up for the 4 bores,4
"WHAT MADNESS BOIS, MEME SEASON!",3
You have to admit RCB is the best team to watch for a neutral. It's not even a debate..,10
I’m just glad we get to see which of Bumrah and Saini is the better bowler at present. Saini should be a sure starter in the Indian team for all formats.,2
Nobody dare say after this that T20 isn't real cricket,6
This ipl is fun. Reminds me of 2009 for some reason.,7
"Thought pollard will sky it, but he waited well to put it in the gap.",1
"Friendship with Umesh is over, Udana is my new best friend.",3
Congratulations to Rcb for snatching a loss from the jaws of victory phenomenal play from Rcb,5
Polly Kishan and Bumrah Set and forget,2
"With 2 dropped chances, RCB didn't just give up on wickets they gave away 12 runs. That was the difference between an easy win and super over.",4
IT WAS 90 REQUIRED OF 30 FFS,9
How to get runs this IPL ? Learn wicketkeeping.,2
If they just ran two for one of those shots but Pollard is a big boi.,1
Why are you the way that you are RCB,5
Ishan Kishan was so fucking good,6
Pollard always delivers when it counts,6
"Which bowler For super over?   
Saini??",4
"How do RCB outdo themselves year after year, it's an art at this point",10
Man the writing this season has been spectacular can't predict even a single ending,17
"Lol, who is gonna bowl the superover for RCB?",10
How did Mumbai tie this match?,4
"AB's like fuck this shit. I have to score, then keep and now do it all over again for a super over.",10
Lowkey miss the old angry Kohli tbh,6
Kishan just did a mayank there,7
Oh Kohli.. oh you poor poor thing..,5
Wish he took a single and got his 100 :(,5
RCB players need sending into a rocket towards the sun,6
"Mi have won. Superover mi is just too op. Pollard, Bumrah, rohit.",3
Pollard has to come out,3
The IPL should remain fixed if this the level of entertainment we get,15
[Called it] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j1armi/match_thread_10th_match_royal_challengers/g6z3gph?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),-1
Don't send Kohli in ffs,3
Please bowl Washington Sundar,3
I think this is the best sports league I’ve seen in my life.,5
Who is going to bowl for us? I am scared,1
I don't want to say this but good god RCB - get a grip.,4
"Prediction time :

Saini is gonna out bowl Bumrah and RCB gonna win the super over",7
Hate how it's a smirk when he messes up and anger when others do.,7
People who are saying fixed match just go fuck yourselves assholes,7
r/FuckKohli,5
I so saini or sundar for the superover?,2
"Pollard, Ishan and Pandya to bat for MI.",2
Mumbai has the upper hand in this super over,6
I think Kohli will himself give up RCB captaincy and go back to auction next year🤣 poor guy,7
I'm both happy we haven't lost yet and sad we didn't win what should have been an easy one,7
Pollard and Ishan to bat,3
Hope Saini bowls,1
I’d keep my clown make-up ready if I was a hopeful RCB fan,5
"As a CSK fan , I just want RCB to win this fuckin game.",3
Can't defend 104 off 36 balls. Just RCB things.,11
Man what a bunch of stupid fielders in RCB!!,3
Lol my night today is dependent on RCB winning,7
We get to see ABD bat again :),2
The fucking smug on virat's face is pissing me off.,5
MI are winning. For sure.,3
So saini or sundar for the superover?,1
What happens if a super over ties?,3
Kishan had the ball to hit at the end too. What a chase from them.,4
What's up with UAE pitches?,2
"They should sit Kohli, send Padikkal, ABD, Dube. Even so, I think MI got a better chance with super overs.",4
Let's hope for better super over than KXIP v DC one.,5
My fucking heart can't take it anymore,5
"

IPL VS 2020",5
Hope Kohli doesn’t come in with that poor form of his.,2
ipl came back strong after 3  snooze fest,2
Trent Boult LOVES a super over,4
"Everyone that was shitting on Pollard, apologize.",4
We better put out Pollard and Rohit for the super over; hell maybe even Kishan instead of Rohit.,1
Are you fucking kidding me. Damn it.,3
Super over! Wow!,2
Why did he a bowl a short ball????,1
"go da, this should have been rcbs win",3
How can i watch this on sky? It’s gone,3
Every other sport can go fuck itself. Cricket is the best thing since sliced bread.,9
When **giving up** is never an option,6
What a game,2
Got to go with Pollard Kishan and hardik,4
"10 games into IPL and we’re already getting the second super over. UAE pitches seem to offer nothing to the bowlers, it all comes down to batting.",4
"Man, tied matches should really give 1.5 and 0.5 points instead of 2 and 0. Getting zero points after a tie is almost too harsh",11
"Why play super overs for league matches. Just give one point to each

~~Please ignore flair~~",6
Leave it to RCB to try their best to loose the game,2
"Pollard, Pandhya, Sharma",0
"Mumbai's got this, no bowler from RCB is going to bowl a decent over.",3
Virat OUT an India captain! Beta male mentality. Single handedly ruined rcb.,1
"AB : Fine, I'll do it myself.",2
RCB is beyond memes.,2
"Let's hope it's a bit more interesting than the last super over this IPL, can't remember who was playing but they only posted 3",3
MI should win this because they have better bowler,1
WHERE'S THE GUY WHO SAID POLLARD WOULD NEED A SIX AND BE A METRE SHORT?,4
How did RCB bottle this.,6
A hell of a lot of potentials on that MI line up,3
Damn this is nervy. I'm worried about MI's bowling. Bumrah has been off,3
And people say they don’t like t20?!! This is pure entertainment ! This type of thrill happens once a lifetime in tests. Happened twice in two days In t20,14
Boult or Bumrah?,2
Ridiculous,1
"RIP RCB

Read this after super over",3
"Both teams play from the same end, right?",2
What a bottle job from RCB,5
AH SHIT HERE WE GOOOOOOOOO LADS,1
Look at RCB. So deflated. Starts at the top,3
Surely Mumbai has upper hand here with good death bowlers ?,3
"Washi, ab, devdutt, finch and dube did so well just for the other 7 to royally fuck up",2
"I am this asking again, who the fuck writes these scripts",8
So MI scored 189 in 16 overs,6
"Man, I think he should have gone for a half volley or smth.",3
"Kohli: ""We deserved to lose"" incoming",6
"Seriously, why would you bowl a short ball there. That too to Pollard. FFS",6
Every team this IPL looks the money with the bat except for the one with the yellow jersey. Thanks for the 7 teams this IPL.,3
Why does the universe hate us,8
MI gonna give me MI,2
Bro this tournament is S U S,3
"R/fucknegi gained an increase in traffic,  wonder why",2
I don't even care if we lose the super over. I'm just so fucking proud of this lot! Jesus fuck I'm so happy and proud!,3
Saini should bowl,2
"I used to see all these comments on RCB and memes and I didn't get it.

Having watching their matches I have to say they deliver. And I feel sorry for RCB fans.",7
Kohli is far more nonchalant than I'm used to seeing him. It's like he's already expecting all this to happen,7
"Guys, I love this chase by our boyz. But looking at the treatment that AbD gave to Bumrah who is our specialist death bowler, it's still RCB'S game to lose. I'm shaking. I'm freaking shaking.",1
[deleted],13
rcb level shit housery,2
Dont worry rcb fans were in this together,3
"Didn't watch ipl this year, was told about some wacky shit happening in this match. What exactly happened and how tf did Rcb score above 200 considering they got all out of 100 last match or something?

Edit : Why am I being Downvoted?",-1
Hopefully this super over is better than the DC and KXIP one. That was so disappointing.,6
RCB showing KIXP who is the boss here.,6
Take a bow Udana. Took out Kishan and tied the match when it seemed like Pollard was going to end it.,6
Koach step down please,2
"Calling it now, RCB will win",1
Can someone else keep instead of AB in the super over?,3
"RCB gifted this win to MI with their fielding!!


ABD and Finch for RCB",6
Literally no score is “enough”,6
RCB will remain RCB till my great great great grandchildren have their great great great grandchildren,7
"Brett ""toss it up"" Lee trolling in the dugout.",3
Surely Kishan and Pollard bat the super over right?,3
RCB needs Rabada .,3
"I could not get into IPL before but quarantine and lack of cricket forced me, I will be back every year from now on.",9
Wide yorker - why not do that?,2
"Advantage MI, Bumrah will bowl their super over.",3
"Kohli captaincy got no tactics, he just hopes bowler will take wickets and can defend any target.",0
Hesson to exorcise Super over demons,2
Given Kohli's brain. He will bowl Sundar and not a quick and fuck it up,2
Kohli complaining to Hesson probably about the bowlers..,2
Who bats for MI? Pandya? Does Kishan go given how tired he looked,1
"For all the dumbos abusing Kohli, what the fuck a captain can do if his fielders aren't going to take a catch?",7
It's really really hard to be an RCB fan. I want ask you guys how do you deal with sooo much pain.. Need tips asking as a SRH fan!,2
Kohli 3 of 11 hmmm 🤔,6
RCB is going to eventually kill me. 17th and 18th overs in a damp dew-filled stadium bowled by leg spinners. Galaxy Brain Time.,6
The whole superover depends on AB now. If he gets going RCB has a chance and if not then its a Mumbai's game.,6
Bottling 🤝 RCB,10
Washington Sundar?,1
"6 players 50+ 

Is it record now",1
"Regardless if the result bowling Chahal to Pollard at 18 over was a bad call, Dube should've bowled.",3
"If Bumrah brings his A game here, anything over 10-12 is gonna be a tough ask for RCB.",1
Bumrah could redeem himself here,1
Boom or Boulty for Super Over?,1
79 from last 4 overs. Holy shit RCB,3
I am just looking at Kohli's face! Honestly feel bad for him now.,3
My man Virat still smiling since he still managed to steal a tie,4
Boult or Bumrah?,1
"Commentary is such a good job. Talk average, watch games, make money!",2
Peak fucking RCB holy shit,4
RCB doesn't even have one quality death bowler,1
Saini for RCB ?,1
"ADB, Finchy and Dube for RCB?

Pollard, fuccboi and vada pav for MI?",2
Gentle Reminder Taking deep into the overs worked but you just want  to have pollard in your team,1
[I made this meme a little too early i think](https://np.reddit.com/r/CricketShitpost/comments/j14s69/snatching_defeat_from_the_jaws_of_victory_is/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share),2
79 off the last 4 overs is ridiculous for MI and dire for RCB,5
Don't give the ball to Washi. Pollard will murder him.,5
"MI: Pollard, Pandya, Ishan. Bowler: Bumrah
RCB: AB, Finch, Padikkal. Bowler: Saini",2
IPL is like WWE. Very entertaining but also very fake. No way does any serious international bowler bowl that ball when defending 5 runs off the last ball unless he's been given a backhander,-6
Kohli's face says it all. He doesn't believe that they are gonna win it.,3
"If udana was given the 19th.

Match would be over by now.",1
"104 out of 36 balls...you can't defend that
This is new low for this team",9
Pollard called Mahela over like he's some some child labor at a tea stall lmao,7
"If Kohli comes in, it'll be game over",6
Saini to bowl for RCB? Probably Pollard + Kishan to bat right?,2
To say RCB messes up things in the end is an understatement........ This is incredible from the champions.....,2
[deleted],1
"""Super over"" is trending internationally over on the Twitter",5
Think Boult should bowl for MI,2
ಠ\_ಠ,19
Kohli has no use now,0
I stopped watching it when it was 90 from 30. No way MI had this. WTFFFFFFFFFFF RCB,3
"Obviously the batter would be Kishan, Pollard and Hardik but I am not sure which two should they send. Pollard is one, hard to pick between Hardik and Kishan. I think Hardik might be just a slightly better choice.",1
Boult should bowl for MI,1
This is just. Just crazy. Like what. The match was gone. What is even happening. Why are we still here. Where is the black hole that needs to swallow us all up.,4
Bruh! And here I thought RCB had this match few hours back....  🍿🍿,3
RCB gonna RCB,2
So is RCB the arsenal of IPL?,2
"I hope MI doesn't give the super over to Boult, the PTSD is gonna make the poor lad go crazy",3
Who will come from RCB? Finch and AB maybe,3
"Losing a match while bowling second, taking 3-4 early wickets seems to be a RCB thing",1
79 off the last ~~over~~ 4 overs oof. Just RCB things,4
If IPL is fixed. PLEASE FIX EVERY FUCKING TOURNAMENT. Coz this is the shit yo,26
"My wife who is a hardcore RCB fan said that from where MI came back they deserve winning today. But, she doesn't realize RCB makes every opponent team feel like they deserve the win!",13
What the fuck is the ipl. Absolutely amazing so far,3
What is sundar is given the ball.,2
bumrah will Bowl super over not easy to defend,2
RCB cant win easily isn’t? They have to add “masala” in each game?,8
"Finch, de Villiers 

Sharma, Hardik

Unless Pollard/Kishan are really putting themselves forward for it",7
BUMRAH VS SAINI,8
Zampa and Udana have to be the weakest overseas bowling duo I've seen in any IPL team.,5
"Play bold, bowl koach",5
RCB is not winning this guys.,1
Guys is Finch injured?,3
Saini has to bowl.,1
[removed],6
Boult and Saini.. I think,2
RCB gave away 105 runs in the last 6 overs. They probably snatched defeat from jaws of victory.,9
1 min of silence for all the RCB fans irrespective of the result.,8
[deleted],52
"Dawood bhai writes the best scripts, we should get him in Bollywood.",11
Pollard Hardik Surya,-2
Super over must be soo.. Draining for both the teams,3
"""bumrah best in the business"" the absolute disrespect to Boult",1
MI were seriously playing Tiwary over Kishan,3
"Not watched any of the games. Any particular reason for so many sixes in these games? Looking at the scorecards I've seen so many players scoring more 6s than 4s that there must be a reason for it? 


Tiny boundaries? Bad bowling? Just great batting? A combination?",1
Who will bowl for RCB,1
The team batting second has a huge advantage in super overs.,3
stepped away. what did i miss?,0
Bowl Saini,1
I cannot understand how they have choked this,2
Pandya rohit and Pollard to bat,2
"Who needs safe, stable committed love and relationship like Test cricket when we can have party and sex every day like IPL ...",7
[deleted],1
I wish soooo bad Ian bishop was on commentary and not this rubbish pieterson,2
Saini pulled off a 2015-17 Bhuvi.....great over it was,10
Shit is this ipl scripted lol anyway it's exciting asf.,2
If Kohli bats it will be 2(6),5
Two consecutive matches have gone from 'snooze fest' to 'How the fuck did that happen'.,4
CAN WE ALREADY DECLARE THIS THE BEST FUCKING IPL SEASON ALREADY,9
"Super Over is the best chance for RCB.

They only have to last one over and AB can actually play the whole over.",6
"RCB fans: MI jeetega.
MI fans: RCB jeetega.
Lmao.",4
I shudder to imagine the places I'd go if I didn't waste my time supporting these rcb wankers,3
Reminder that I sending my nudes is dependent on RCB winning,3
"To be fair, both the teams were shit in bowling",2
"Deadass not a RCB fan, but they should win man, else ppl won't stop shitting on kohli",2
Saini to bowl?,1
Kishan leaving without century 🥺,2
"All my RCB friends are having meltdown already .

Almost feel sorry for them 😂",2
How do you not win in a 200 chase with one bowlers figure reading 4-0-12-1,2
THIS IPL IS FUCKING WILD.,4
"Holy moly sholly jolly Kohli

What did I just watch?",6
Koach and AB should come. Please don't send dubey in front of bumrah,3
So the difference between Umesh and no Umesh is not much really huh?,8
Mumbai should go with Kishan and Pollard. No blunder.,1
Last 2 games are making up for last week,3
"Forests are burning, Plague ravaging through earth. Locust swarms destroying crops, Murder Hornets in North, on the brink of WW3 and so on. In such an unpredictable year, RCB has helped in restoring some of the balance by being utter shit as always. I am sure Koach had this in mind when he said they are playing people's happiness this  year. <3",5
"   
**Highest scores by uncapped Indian players in IPL**

99  Ishan Kishan vs RCB Dubai 2020 \*",8
The script writers of this IPL are insane,5
Script writers should make sure the games are not this obvious,8
Every year I think that this is it or Pollard and every year he comes out with innings like this. What a legend.,3
"Only RCB can fuck it up from where they were at the 15 over point. But man what application and hitting from Kishan and Pollard, brilliant.",8
Upvote this thread bois,3
Super over should not go to Udana. I'd give it to Saini,3
4 overs 12 runs is the real gem in this whole match.,6
Has the IPL always been this mental?!,11
Why didn't Pollard play last yr WC?,3
I blew my voice out. Anyone else?,3
"If this match is fixed, then all players are replaced by robots.

The precision required, to tie it like this, is not humanly possible.",9

Last super over Pooran got a pair. Can Kishan get a 100 with the help of super over!?,0
"RCB should bowl Sundar today. He's been their best bowler. I know spin doesn't work the best against Pollard and Pandya but that's the biggest gamble you could. Saini, my second bet.",1
16th over is when RCB inevitably shits the bed each time,3
"Hi r/cricket, here's Jimmy N, I'm with RCB",5
Kohli shouldn't come in to bat,2
I think mumbai has the advantage in super over.,3
RCB showing they can do anything RCB 2.0 does. And they can do it better.,3
"Truth be told, RCB will take the super over I think.",4
Brain-dead apes wants RCB to lose just to shit on kohli. Because f'd up bowling is his fault as well.,8
WHY? JUST WHY? WHY THIS EVERY FUCKING YEAR? WHY? WHYYYY????,9
Koach is out of form. He shouldn't come.,2
do super over count as separate inns for batsmen or not considered in career runs and average?,3
"I Don't give a shit

Imagine batting your heart out and the bowlers not able to defend 80 of the last 4.,7
Every match looks like a different movie.lol,8
Is he harrddick enough now?,6
abd can pull of atleast 20 be it any bowler.,6
Ishan? Imagine England did this and played Roy. Dumb cunts,3
"rcb fans, our fears in never trusting this team come back right at us",4
"RCB, thanks for the meme competition.",7
HOT TAKE: T20 IS THE BEST CRICKET FORMAT,5
RCB lucky that they are not playing at Bengaluru because they would have lost this game already.,2
Polly kaka went out to bat after praying to Lord Tewatia.,4
Udana has bullshit for a brain. I mean who bowls a slow bouncer to motherfucking Pollard,4
Kohli's poor batting display and bowling choices costing us matches,1

Why send fucking hardik fucking pandya what the hell!!!,2

"To all RCB fans, how many think u can win this?",1

RCB are entertainers alright but have y'all thought about the mental health of their fans?,3
Who scored more boundaries?,3
"Kohli going to cry!!

RCB is not good for his mental health.",2
Wait why would you not put the guy who got 99 into the superover. Is he really that tired??,5
Boult will bowl,2
Let’s go navdeep,2
Why Pandya? Kishan and Pollard were brilliant.,4

Anyone behind having just a single wicket for a super over?,1
It would be just like RCB to concede 36 here,5
Excellent yorker,2
Do both teams get new balls when bowling super overs?,5
Pollard should take strike,2
Would be horrible to see Koach comes to open in the super ovet,4
Pollard agaisnt pace? And no Kishan?,3
"This is all Mumbai from here. None of the RCB batsman are in good hitting form, other than AB. And bloody Bumrah is gonna be bowling.",4
"What's Kohli's fault when bowlers cant bowl Yorkers and fielders won't take catches?
Can't blame him always for teams shit performance in the field.",4
A super over after a tied super over makes sense unlike that retarded boundary count rule in the WC.,8
Great yorker to execute with dew,1
Got no confidence in fuckboi. :/,2

33% of super over well bowled so far.,1
One year they should make it so that teams get to choose who bats and bowls for the super over for each other - imagine Kohli bowling to Bumrah and Boult,5
Saini is really good.,1
Amazing,1
Impressive stuff,1
Saini the beauty,2
Bubbles are the way to go. First the NBA with an amazing playoffs and now the IPL. BRILLIANT,1
Surely RCB don't lose the super over!,3
That was a ball begging to be hit for a six. Hardik gets 1. MI at least need to get 12+,4

Good for India",5

"This is like watching Kings XI-DC game all over again, great fight back and then a shitty super over",4
Fuck. We needed at least 15.,2
Why didn't they bowl like this earlier?,2
and here i was thinking we should try to improve our nrr,3
Will they drop catches even in super over?,2
Saini is great,1
INJECT THIS IPL INTO MY VEINNSSS.,3
Do they get referrals for super overs?,1
"Saini, Shami and Chahar FOR WC 21",2
Saini Masterclass on a dewy night.,3

rohit should have come in actually,3

Why no Kishan? Reputation over form,3
At least RCB isn't chasing more than 21,2
Saini's stamping his mark.,3
Mumbai lose 2 wickets here naaa pls,1
Navdeep “McGrath” Saini,7
Rohit going in next instead of Ishan? WTF.,2

"Regardless of how it goes, I'm glad that Saini is getting the chance to bowl the super over.",5
Need some sixes to recover this,1
The fielding has been shocking,2
RCB’s fielding has been utter shit,2
"This ""player who scored the most must be tired"" reason for not sending that player in super over is just plain stupid",6
Fuck off man,3
Such pathetic fielders.,2
Yup MI fucked themselves by not sending Kishan. Game over.,3
How the fukk is that four? Ridiculous hitting.,3
Maybe kishan was exhausted,3
what is Saini cursing?,3
Bruh,2
What an over so far let down by RCB fielding,6
Live Cricket + Reddit ❤️,10
RCB fielding is atrocious.,7
Gurkeerat man has effectively lost this match for RCB,5
What the hell !! Don't ruin it,8
Outfielders have been miserable,5
Wtf we don't have boundary fielders,5
Lol don’t take advice from Chahal after his beating,4
"""Behen ke laude"" from Saini lmao",11
Saini looks like Rafa from Narcos.,3
2 sixes please,2
Fucking stupid fielding.,2
"Oof this IPL is crazy, glad I didn't miss this one",8
Needs to save that.,2
Aesa dhak dhak horela hai re baba,7
They have outscored KXIP's super over score,8
Gurkeerat mann you have only one job today,2
AB should be at long-on,2
"This is Gurkeerat Mann Singh's last match. One missed catch and now this fielding miss.

P.S.: He reddemed himself.",4
Behen ki laude,6
RCB has the most useless fielding when under pressure,3
RCB is really missing Finch's fielding. He is a gun catcher/fielder.,5
Everyone knows you keep mid-off straight for Pollard!,2
Maybe Kishan is just tired and walked away himself?,1
Fucking get abd in the outfield.,4
RCB absolutely shit in fielding,4
Behen ke laude,5
Need a six,2
RCB with the dropped catches and misfields are doing their best to make the game interesting.,6
Did Saini just cuss Kohli?,2
"Is it just me or does r/cricket seem more RCB biased?

Edit: I just now saw that the u/cricketmatchbot has the RCB flair",3
Saini is amazing. Carrying this shit bowling lineup,7
Ishaan has to be cramping like Mayank that day,3
Rcb missing AB in the deep.,5
"RCB should erect a fucking statue of SAINI outside their place. Dudes legit their best bowler, probably of all time",8
Remember when AB and Kohli would be at long-off and long-on? And that part of the ground was locked in?,9
For the super over they should have asked Abd to take off the gloves and field. This man can do everything and he’s invaluable,6
Saini channelling his inner Nehra,5
"Man, i love saini",6
GOD BLESS SAINI CATCH,3
Gurkirat has done so much to help MI today lmao,10
Saini is gold,12
Great experience this for Saint.,3
RCB wins this.,2
"Saini has fucking nerves of steel, take a bow",8
Pollard you’ve had a fucking stinker there,3
Get innnn.. saini you beautiful stallion,3
NICE,1
Arey Behen ki laude,2
GG Rcb,1
Great stuff  by Saini.,6
Handing MI the victory on a plate.,0
Need atleast a boundary to make it somewhat competitive total,2
RCB'S gonna win it yoo,2
"Don't tell me MI are the chokers

I still believe we will choke this one too",6
Good over till now by Saini. Great going. Hope he bowls a dot ball on the last ball.,2
RCB fielding has been awful,2
What an anti-climax this,2
Excellent full toss. Love it,2
Finally taking a goddam catch,2
Looking promising guys. But this is RCB so I should probably stfu,4
Saini you beautiful human being!!,7
Top stuff front Navdeep Saini.. Finally Kohli has something to cheer for,3
Has Saini played for India yet?,4
No way is MI defending this. Not with Bumrah in this form. Damnit Saini why you gotta be this good,1
Want mumbai to win just cuz I feel like they deserve it a bit more,4
Gambhir would be so proud of Saini today!,3
RCB peaking in super over is peak 2020,3
Redemption,2
"Rohit should've batted there, Pollard was looking pretty tired",4
Dint he just misfield one at long off?,1
Gurkeerat is a brilliant fielder when he is not playing for RCB (im not joking),8
Saini proving he us good enough for the Indian T20 side,4
Nooooo,1
Low full tosses are better option over length deliveries.,2
fucking hate u rcb jk love u bastards,5
Saini is so good at death bowling,2
"lulz, game done and dusted bois",2
Fuck my heart just jumped out,2
Need six of this ball,4
Bumrah redemption incoming.......,3
Max only 12 ABD can chase that,3
Abd would have been at long off.. missing his fielding big time,2
"Kohli Redemption arc coming, gear up",4
Navadeep just decided to cancel Mumbai Fucking Indians. And he just he did it.,5
They need ABD in field so bad,5
disrespect to Kishan WTF,13
Saini>>>>>>>>Bumrah imo,2
Mumbai basically pulled an RCB here in the super over,9
I think Kohli should come in with ABD. They both run fast. That might be enough,6
"Lol, went to Gurkeerat after they moved him to mid wicket but at least he held on. 

His heart must have been in his mouth.",2
Boundary or game over,2
LOL Gurkeerat. Ball is following him. 😂😂,3
"Excellent low full toss. Thinking bowler, this Saini.",3
Fucking Navdeep man. I wish I had half his composure.,2
Saini - Nerve of Steels,3
Saini evolved from siraj-dinda to bhuvi-bumrah in one f'in year,4
Should have sent kishan poor lad,3
Anything less than 12 and RCB may just be back again in this match,3
Theoretically 6 is defendable by Bumrah,3
"Shame Pollard couldn't carry us through. Still, he had a great match today.",3
Bumrah redemption arc?,3
Rohit is going to miss this completely.,5
"Saini has not given am inch to the big man.

Legendary stuff.",1
Saini should play in the WC next year!!,4
I fucking hate advertisements fuck ads.,2
Rcb you have given me hope again. Don't smash it again,3
brohit should have started the super over,2
Kishan robbed,4
Virat and AB in the super over?,1
Bring Parthiv for Keeping and let AB field,1
Still might be a tied super over,2
Only way for RCB to elevate their meme status would be to fail in a 7 run chase.,15
You should go further away KP,1
Yup MI deserve to lose for not putting in Kishan,7
Hardik haggu in this ipl tbh,7
Gg,3
Lara vs Lee heating up in the dugout lmao.,5
"RCB wins this. But really... Koach how are you so fucking shit??

We were no where and now we're in a super over. That's just terrible captaincy bruh.",2
We will send Rohit and ABD. Virat is still Captain guys. We win,3
abd will chase this in 2 balls ffs,10
You know Kohli's gonna come out opening and meme it up for us lmao,11
Remove that four and this is a dream super over. Hope he doesn't fuck up the last ball 🤞,5
It sucks that super over performance don't count for your stats.,11
Mayank Agarwal in the previous and now Inshan Kishan in this,12
[deleted],9
"Agree with KP, sometimes teams make incredibly interesting decisions",17
Brian Lara spewing the truth in dugout lmao,10
"Damn saini, I apologize for the 'dinda comments'",10
"Gurkeerat Maan didn't bat or bowl, dropped Pollard and now misfielded lol",13
"If only Bumrah was in form, this could be competitive super over.",23
Rcb should win this easily. Bumrah was all over the place and it's difficult to defend 8,4
Why you send this ffucking FUCKBOI😡,6
Inagine sending Rohit for taking quick single .,23
FML. Game over,6
7?,3
GOD BLESS SAINI,8
Saini you beautiful beautiful man,7
MI making the same mistake KXIP did,12
I can see the adrenaline on Saini,4
Wow just Wow,3
Shit fielding from RCB today,1
[removed],11
kishan is prob tired af,7
I can't believe it,3
I’ve invested my time and we fucked it in that over. Fuck my live,6
fuckboi useless😡,6
Sofdik,2
Ishan Kishan has to be cramping like Mayank for KXIP.,11
What a waste. Disappointing to it's core.,4
"A
W
E
S
O
M
E",2
Pandya instead of Kishan is a war crime,14
Six pack saini💪💪,6
What a fucking over. Straight up fire from Saini.,5
Saini clutch af,6
"If RCB loses this, they should just delete themselves.",9
BEAUTIFUL,2
Saini is the new Bumrah,7
I eat all the shit I've spewed about Saini over the years,11
Pandya lul. Specialist batsman my ass,6
CHOKE,2
What a boss over by Saini.,10
Outstanding bowling Saini,3
Not harddick enough confirmed,4
Bumrah pls get us a win..,3
"8 in an over, should be taken",3
MI doing a KXIP with no Kishan.,5
Wow...we just shat the bed in Superover,2
Top over from Saini. Also bowled the 19th over brilliantly,2
Ishan kishan is crying.,7
Boom boom boom boom we have this.....,5
Poor Ishan Kishan,3
Good Bowling ngl.,2
What an over,2
Lol kohli and ABD can just get singles and doubles,2
8 to win. It better be finch and ABD.,2
Great over Saini!,1
Saini too OP respect,2
I feel bad for Kishan😥😥,2
"Cmon RCB, I'm backing you if only so I can claim that RCB have won 100% of their matches that I have watched cause I was busy during the KXIP one",2
Saini what a legend! Horrible move to keep Kishan out.,1
What a bowling. Just don't fuck it up from here.,1
"I was rooting for MI but with no Ishan, yeah get fucked.",2
Look how they massacred my boy.,2
Saini continues to impress me,1
RCB pls pull this through,1
"RCB fielders have been so pathetic, no words.",1
One of the greatest Super Overs I have seen. They better not fuck with Saini.,2
What a beautiful over this by Saini. Will RCB choke while chasing?,2
Fucking amazing over. Would've been literally amazing if that four was stopped,2
Yeah that doesn't spark joy,3
MI did it to themselves... What a fuck up.,3
Outstanding bowling Saini,2
Hell yeah! Let's go Saini,1
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!?!?!!?!?!!,1
Now Kohli should definitely come for his running superiority,5
That could have been a runout for a regular keeper,5
I HAVE BEEN HOLDING MY URINE SINCE THE 16TH OVER THEY BETTER WIN THIS ONE,17
Absolutely bullshit. Kishan should habe come out.,3
My God legendary over from Saini. Should have sent kishan instead of pandya.,5
Ishan Kishan got robbed. Fuck these tactics. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.,6
RCB have just taken a longer route to victory like Delhi.,3
Saini also needs a redemption thread,3
The fuck was this captaincy?,0
[deleted],0
AB gonna finish it off,2
"Saini's done his job, now ABD and Devdutt should come out and do theirs.",2
Wonderful execution by Saini...kept calm,2
"Hey folks, what happened if the super over is a tie? will they do super over again or the boundary count?",2
"Absolute clowns, MI. RCB wins this easily. Fuck off MI.",5
Pandya brothers are shit,5
Whos is padding up?,2
For any team not named RCB an easy chase,3
Lowkey feeling bad for kishan,7
mi still has a chance if kohli sends himself in,7
"Virat, ab and finch?",2
Mahn! Saini is just wow.. All the international experience helping!,5
Holy shit this match just keeps on giving,2
Rcb can still fuck it up. Boorman can defend as its rcb,2
Anti climactic way to end,1
Ngl RCB did well,6
Kohli ABD need to come,1
Saini masterclass!,1
Koach must bat with de Villiers. Perfect time for low-risk 2s.,4
"You'd normally back any side to chase 8 off an over, but this is RCB we're on about",4
Saini looking incredibly calm.,3
"Ishan...you should've gone for your 100, these guys don't deserve you",6
"Inside part of RCB's towel is made up of sand paper and outside part is covered by some mint, so all he had to do is touch the ball and it gets the wicket.. That's the secret why he is not giving away runs.. BccI wont check his bat bcoz rcb=bcci=pig3 so dont respect them. MI  will win. RCB injured Tiwary. but their daddy ishan is back. they can't threaten him with national contract to play badly like they did to tiwary in second match.",9
 Saini and Sundar ~~the SS bois~~ have done their deed. It is up to the batsmen now.,5
"I feel for Ishan, I really do",5
No Kohli please. He isn't in form,8
Hardik is just Afridi minus the clutch,7
"Saini has to be a permanent member in the National team, he is gold",8
Bumrah will redeem himself,5
Kishan be like : mehnat barbad bc,6
"Feel for Kishan, didn't give a shit about his 100, his team deserves the win",1
take a bow saini!,7
Saini angry young man. You are a fucking legend.,6
"The way he has been bowling at death, doubt if Bumrah can defend 7 for more than a couple of bowls",3
Kishan is unhappy as fuck cani see him,4
"for the sake of the innings Ishan kishan played , he should have there in super over instead of pandya ..",2
Bumrah and Saini for India will be fucking glorious,6
"Should have sent Kishan, he was on form. Punjab made the same mistake of not sending Mayank.",3
Absolutely brilliant from Saini.,3
Both Rohit and Kohli shitting the bed today,1
Rabada would defend this.,3
Finch and ABD please,2
"I feel sorry for Ishan Kishan. He brought his team so close, yet they are in a position to lose.",3
that kid tried his best :'(,2
We agree KP. Can you shut up now,1
Someone should lock Virat in the Bathroom or else he'll want to Bat.,4
"Come on, Kohli and AB coming out to bat. Great over from Saini.",0
"RCB has found their death over specialist!!

Now go all out on Saini!!",3
Abd coming to fuck MI i guess lol,8
Why not send in Kishan? We’ll need to see a Bumrah masterclass to defend this.,3
Damn saini man of the match,2
"Wow Saini, whatever the result is excellent super over. Wouldve been 4 runs if not for that misfield",2
Singles will get them home. Who am I kidding? Bumrah's gonna leak that in 2 deliveries,3
Man I'm really glad we have another reliable pacer in saini now for t20s,3
Brilliant super over from Saini,2
Bumrah’s got to pull something out of his ass.,2
It's so odd that teams go for historical reputation than red hot form for super over. Ishan Kishan would have scored better than Hardik.,1
Rusty boom and no Ishan in super over... Yeah No MI....,2
Kohli played the card Saini.,4
Great saini we have bowler for death as india,2
What an absolute Chad Saini is... If he's this awesome in RCB. Imagine what a force he'll become once he leaves RCB.,6
"I will believe that RCB can win this game, when they win this game.",5
Any team except RCB can 100% win this,5
"LoL at Mumbai for the moment.

RCB 3/2 in five balls can't be ruled out.",3
Ishan should've been there instead of Hardik,4
Saini has done a great job. Hope the batsmen will back it up,1
ABD Dube Kohli?,2
Angry Saini >>>>>> Angry koach,8
Sunny G fuming that Ishan Kishan isn't getting a chance to get a single and get his hundred,3
MI fucked it like KXIP by not sending set batsman Ishan Kishan. Great over by Saini. If not for that misfielding he would have only given 5 runs instead of 7.,5
All this just for Benjamin Villers to fuck it up by playing a misguided ramp shot or something.,1
"Kishans constantly Tonkin Saini , should've sent him",2
"My faith in Sainiji has never wavered. Great bowler, luck not favoring him is the difference",3
I hope Mumbai fucking lose this for not sending in Kishan,2
Seeing Kisan like that. He seems so sad.,3
KP “sorry at the risk of repeating myself”... as if that isn’t his approach to comms every game,3
Funnier things have happened in cricket before. RCB can win this but I won't believe it until they hit the winning runs.,6
"KP is right, Kishan could have hit a 4 or 6 and got the score to 12 or so.",1
AB and koach should be able to do this in 1s and 2s,3
Yikes I thought Rohit was a better captain,2
Unless Bumrah bowls two searing Yorkers first up this match is over,6
AB better take strike here,3
Mumbai praying for Kohli to bat,6
If MI are smart Boult will bowl this,4
great bowling from Saini. He is lock in Indian short form team. Probably will be part of Quartet of seamers for Aussie test tour.,5
"[Aha my prediction coming through](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j1armi/match_thread_10th_match_royal_challengers/g6z4def/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)

Saini is ridiculously underrated death bowler",7
[deleted],2
Bumrah can defend this..,2
**Come on Kohli. Time to take massive dump on your haters**,2
Pandya has always shat the bed against anything close to decent pace bowling so why did the team send him?,3
Why did they send Hardik Pandya?He is not in the form clearly,3
Honestly whoever drops catches should be dropped. It’s so unacceptable.,1
That misfield was good for us! But u never know.,2
Rabada quality over,1
"Relax, Mumbai. It's RCB. Expect memes.",3
"No need to hit it out of the park. Singles 
and doubles will do it",6
"If you lose 2 wickets in the superover, you can't face any more of the left deliveries, right?",2
"Bumrah and Saini bowling the super overs. Don't think it was imaginable in the IPL, 5 years ago, to trust Indian bowlers to deliver in such situations.",3
Ab and kohli. I want kohli. It is an easy target. He can play these things well,3
"RCB sure can't lose from here, can they?",1
"No surprise this frm Saini. Dude got Polly like 2 times in the T20 series last year. The first time he didn't let a well set Pollard(46 balls) hit any of 3 deliveries, getting him on the third. This match too Pollard looked dicey against him, simply rotating the strike to Ishan.",5
We gotta go for the wickets. Need 2,1
Eat some pubes Rohit ? Hope you do,-1
Why the duck was ishan kishan didn't bat the super over,1
Missed that match and tuned in to super over. Was expecting 20 run over by MI.,2
"Send Finch and ABD.

Kohli in stand-by for taking quick singles.",3
maybe ABD and Finch,2
I'd go with Trenty tbh,2
Bumrah vs SuperOver. It's not easy dude!,1
Hardik Pandya has been useless this IPL.,1
"seriously, ishan is tired but he could've played two more balls. much better than pandya for sure.",3
Can't believe Kishan sacrificed his century to see Pandya being sent to bat in the super over.,6
r/nononoyesno,6
Rohit would have been a better option instead of Pandya,1
Bumrah can still save us. He is the best after all.,2
"All Ishan Kishan had to do was take a single, put Pollard on strike who would've hit a four anyways and win Mumbai the match",1
People Saying Ishan? He is tired and clearly was left with no energy. He was never going to be there. Not sure why is it difficult for people to see,6
[deleted],1
I honestly hate that lady who is using her paralysis to sell whitehat jr,5
Someday Kohli would just collapse while fielding at long on and we won't even know,7
It's gotta be Bumrah bowling right? But who knows with these dumbasses.,3
"Just so you know, Saini gets picked for yelling ""Bhen k laude"" with such finesse. Bowling is just a nice bonus",4
When was the last time RCB was in a super over?? It's been a while I think...usually we win big or fuck up early.,3
Bumrah redemption coming up,2
Scenes if Bumrah mankad Kohli .,4
Ishaan Kishan should have come out with Pollard. They made the same mistake as DC the other night.,4
"Koach to open the batting , run out De Villiers and then hit wicket next ball",10
I back Boult for the over,1
Kohli should send himself and then take all the credit to trigger as many people as possible.,5
Wish MI won for the RCB bowling memes :(,2
Who wins if Super over ties?,2
So... uhm... we can win this right? Aha haha Jk... unless..? Nah I'm just kidding haha.. but if you think so too?...JK...UNLESS??,10
Who do you think KP thinks should've batted in that Super Over?,2
"If anyone can fuck it up here, we know exactly who it is",8
"This was a sure short victory for rcb anyday. But gotta be careful of bumrah, he might just find his nick in time.",4
Boult or Bumrah?,1
Seems like luck has finally smiled on RCB,2
"If RCB loses this, they should play all bench players for rest of the tournament",5
"Saini deserves credit for looking to hit the Yorkers right through but that was just poor batting. Kishan with the left-right combo created a few wides, he also was more comfortable against Saini than Pollard.",3
There is only one man who could have defended this and he is playing for Delhi.,9
Teams with Kiwi players aren't winning super over. This super over curse is following our players around like a dog with separation anxiety.,7
Ruined the chance to massively improve our NRR just to score 7 in the super over? Really MI? REALLY?,11
"Pandya was not set he was chilling in the dressing room and kishan was in the middle.

As simple as that.",11
If bumrah bowls 6 yorkers. They win.,6
Has to be Ab and Dube right?,1
Finch cannot come in as he was retired hurt during the fielding,2
Bumrah is a class bowler and could defend this,1
Shit Yohan Blake is ac cricket fan lol,1
Koach Kohil's time at the crease is why RCB is in this mess now. I mean bowling was always fucked.,3
Sad to see ishan kishan efforts go in vain,4
This game isn't good for my heart,6
"As big as Kohli's ego is, will he keep himself out of this superover?",7
"If RCB wins this match, Kohli should get **entire credit** right?? 

**Hard truth cuts both ways**",0
Ig abd and finch to bat? With kohli or dube coming in later?,3
MI taking 2 wickets has more probability than RCB chasing,4
Bat Kohli and ABD and just milk the twos,5
I'm gutted that we bottled the super over but I feel devastated for Kishan.,2
[deleted],1
"Just look at Ishan Kishan , so disappointed",1
Saini just booked his ticket to Australia right there,3
Abd gonna finish this using a couple of deliveries.,1
KP biggest hypocrite -> remember when you used to get tired and ask for runner?,8
Man Ishan looks so sad,3
ultimately rhythm counts. Kishan would have done better though he is exhausted. But one has to give credit to Saini. He bowled some great deliveries.,1
It seems they(MI)didn't watch previous match with super over(Ishan Kishan).,3
I hope the first ball goes for 6.,1
"Mumbai needed 90 of the last 5, yet they were the ones who choked in the end... Cricket lol",7
If I scream anymore they’ll put me in an asylum.,6
"There is something wrong with RCB management. In hindi comms, Ashish Nehra (Ex-RCB bowling coach) kept saying Saini shouldn't bowl yorkers as he is not good at it. Eat shit, Nehra. No wonder he failed under your guidance.",11
if Kohli had not sent in a set batsman in the super over he would get a helluva lot more flak than Rohit is.,5
Kishan got out on 99 because his parents rhymed his first and last name.,21
"I've said it since the first time I saw him, Saini has a very bright future and sure be a sure select in the Indian side",7
I was supposed to sleep 2 hrs back :(,6
"Almost choked when KP said ""at the risk of repeating myself"", before giving his opinion on who should have been in for Mumbai for like the 12th time...",5
Arey camera man ples don't cover Ishan Kishan... It's so heartbreaking.. Can't take this literally!,12
We have to take a wicket in the first 2 balls. If RCB play 6 balls they win,5
There is  a 98% chance the batting team win this. But tis RCB so who knows.,3
Download Cred baby😂😂😂😂😂,4
"even Bumrah can't defend this.  
Only RCB can lose it from here",6
Low key feels like super over too gonna finish in tie. NZ fans look away.,3
Ishan Kishan isn’t even out for fielding? Has to have cramps,7
Kishan explaining that his hands got wet,4
Send ABD and Finch. Just rotate strike and get those runs safely in 4 or 5 balls.,2
ABD will chase this in 3 balls.,5
"With RCB, I can totally expect them to get boty wickets down for 4 runs in super over.",3
AB and Kohli.,2
I'd be furious if I were a Mumbai fan,1
"Boult, a New Zealander is in Mumbai's 11

RCB won this the moment it went to a super over",10
[deleted],2
Gavaskar again making excuses for Mumbai batsmen,4
"Bumrah to york ABde and Padikkal, you heard it here first",1
"If we were gonna lose, Kishan should’ve just nudged a single lmao",3
What's the boundary count between the two teams ?,2
Wow Gavaskar is lip reader,2
I wish I had the same confidence in life as Gavaskar has while lip reading muted conversations.,3
in the Netflix doco was Kishan painted as spoilt?,1
"Don't blame it on kishan Now.,..",1
"If RCB wins this, firstly they don't really deserve it, secondly MI threw by not bringing Kishan out for the super over",2
On a bright side if someone can defend this total then it should be Bumrah.,4
Does Koach put himself in?,3
"If anyone can win this, it's a Bumrah who's on point. Let's see if he can show up.",5
ABD and?,2
"Man, heartbreak just looking at Ishan. Hope MI win it just for that kid.",7
Daft thinking from MI cost them. No point in not having Kishan out there.,7
Please RCB don't fuck this up,6
Wicket early in the over will be the ultimate,1
"NGL, seeing Ishan emotional is sad. But someone should teach the newcomers to not to take things personally. Kuldeep made the same mistake, ishan is repeating it.",3
RCB isn’t good for my health man . My heart can’t take anymore of this,3
First Aggarwal and now Ishan not being sent in super over after playing well for 19 odd overs. Are the coaches on drugs??,2
"Thicc Boi is not worried about losing the match, he's worried about losing it from Koach.",2
What the deal with MI and man buns?,2
Now I feel MI deserved to win this for all their efforts.,2
I think RCB will bottle it,2
Somebody record ishan kishan rant.,2
"Two bowlers could defend this, Bumrah and Rabada",6
Super over from Saini. It is RCB's game to lose,3
Just run 2s,1
Seeing kishan frustrated makes me sad :(,8
This is going to be ABD vs Bumrah. Earlier ABD won now is it Bumrah turn,2
Bumrah's gonna bowl,3
First Ball: Six. Wild prediction..,3
"Finch is injured!?

The fuck!?

RCB's luck has been written with donkey's dick.",11
Ishan Kishan more like Ravi Kishan lmao itnaaaaa nautanki,-3
"We shouldn't have even got to this super over point at all. But now we have, so I hope we manage to win this 🤞",3
Only wickets will do the trick now,7

"Jasprit Bumrah's Super Overs in IPL

WHAT THE FUCK",3
AB will choke. It's upto Kohli.,1
"Just 8 needed. If RCB focuses on smart cricket, instead of big hits, this is their game",3
Bumrah can’t defend shit in current form lol.,4
" **Jasprit Bumrah's Super Overs in IPL**  
6/0 vs GL Rajkot 2017 (Won)  
8/2 vs SRH Mumbai WS 2019 (Won)",5
RCB: PLEASE FUCKING WIN!,3
Oh no koach is coming out whyyyy,3
Imagine bumrah mankading kohli,10
Kohli,5
Fuck this shit,4
Just when I thought the last game couldn't be topped...,9
Why Kohli lol,8
Koach walking in,6
I swear if Kohli fucks this up again.,7
"""Keep your cool Virat""",4
damn this game is so fun when you don’t give a shit ab who wins lol,7
I bet RCB winning this. If only Bumrah was in good form!,2
First ball - OUT (i hate myself for even thinking this),3
WHY IS PADDIKAL NOT PLAYING?,3
"If I were Ab right now, I would take singles, doubles and take this home safely.",5
Why Kohli whyyy,2
Lol Kohli,4
Kohli.... Cmon yaar...,2
Why is padikkal not being sent,2
VIRAT Kohli redemption arc incoming,3
Let’s go!!!!! AB and Virat!!!!,1
Scenes if Kohli blocks every ball,2
Wtf Kohli coming to bat,3
Now they gon run,3
"Oo fuck we pulled it out of nowhere

And here we are losing again",2
Fucking Kohli...,3
The only way we are winning is with both wickets. Singles and doubles get them through,3
Is this going to be Bumrahs first super over loss?,2
I can't even be mad at you MI. What a nice surprise this was. Loss is fine but loved the fight!,3
Mini redemption time for Kohli,6
"Redeem yourself unlike Pooran pls, Virat",8
Kohli with worst form of season coming now. Hope he hits a boundary at least now.,5
Fucker called his own number. Lol.,2
Fuck! ABD has to do everything.,3
Kohli? Send Dube or Finch,3
"LOL Kohli :topkek:

This is where RCB lost!

(Well I guess, I was wrong!)",1
RCB NEEDS THIS WIN FOR KOHLI'S CONFIDENCE.,2
Kohli wants to contribute too,1
"Koach will have the last laugh, relax all RCB fans😂😂😂",2
Kohli gonna run 2s and win this match is 4 balls.,2
Kohli comes to steal all the thunder.,2
"Knowing how the match has gone, ABD will hit the first or second ball for six",2
Oh boy oh man,2
Kohli jitna besharam banda nhi dekha,-1
Kohli Redemption or in the mud,2
Bumarh is out of form so no chance for MI.,2
Good choice. Kohli runs fast,5
Koach you should've let Padikkal come out,5
"Not good, Kohli shouldn't have come out first. Had to send Dube.",2
Imagine if they can’t even chase this one.,3
Kohli is going to win it,3
"Jasprit Bumrah's Super Overs in IPL
6/0 vs GL Rajkot 2017 (Won)
8/2 vs SRH Mumbai WS 2019 (Won)",4
KOACH LMAO,4
Pieterson just called Virat Koach,8
Fuak it's kohli,3
Who called him koach..,6
come on Koach and AB.  if these can't.. no one can..,3
If I was Bumrah -> I would be scared of these 2,2
Viral Kilo!!,3
"Come on Kohli, fuck it up",2
I'll probably have a heart attack if this goes W6W,2
Should have been Finch,2
"Man this is interesting.. If they fuck this up, I havr no words",2
Is boundary rule still in effect? which team has more boundaries ?,2
I think MI's management works on data. Data doesn't always win though. Bumrah will fail. Hopefully,2
Out comes Virat. I forsee a runout.,2
Did KP embrace the koach meme just now?,6
Keep calm and trust Kohli.,2
Ok. Kohli is backing his non existent form.,5
KP just said “it’s the koach” for Virat,8
Two generation legends walking in front of bumrah. Let's see this battle,2
"3(11) in a super over, oh boy this is risky",4
"Why no Padikkal?

Edit: corrected the name. Apologies for typo",2
Two greatest batsman in the history of the game to score 8 from 6 .,4
"That's the koach 

There are no accidents",5
Kohli mate same innings again please,3
Kishan for MOTM despite MI losing.,5
Kohli being selfish af here,5
Shit kohli tere se na ho payega,1
What happened to Finch?,2
Bowl Polly you cowards,4
Koach please....do something right for once,3
Kohli and AB in a super over against Bumrah. Unreal stuff.,2
"Used to hate KPs commentary, he aight now",5
RCB is winning,1
Kohli coming in to run 4 twos.,2
Why Koach!!,1
Respect Kohli. Leading from the front.,3
Walking wicket Kohli decides to walk out lol,2
Oh lawd he coming: commentators on Kohli,2
"Bumrah to Kohli and de Villiers, the superstar ending to this game.",7
Kohli is going to get out! Why not Finch?,2
expected Dube,1
Lol. Now comm box is also calling him Koach,9
I don't trust kohli.,2
Redemption opportunity for Kohli,0
Hope Virat does Tewatia part 1,4
"Come on Kohli, get your IPL started",1
Will bumrah do a Rabada?,2
In retrospect this is the best pair to run them to 8.,1
"Let's see if our country""s top bowler can defend this.",2
Kohli LoL Mumbai can hope now,1
Kohli is in the worst form & Bumrah is in the worst form,2
I understand you are the captain.  But virat you scored 3 off 11. Send the ones in form.,10
"Kohli is gonna get all the acclaims for the win now, isnt he?",3
Imagine if England sent jason roy and not ben stokes in the world cup final.,4
Got to say Kohli has the confidence if not the form.,5
Will get over in first three balls.. Abd is going to trash Bhumrah. You saw it here first,1
"lmao, why are people surprised seeing koach here? he was absolutely going to bat",3
"lol kohli dude, nooo you're shit atm",4
Only kolhi can win it for MI,2
KP needs to calm down,3
Test of Bumrah’s mental strength...,2
Did you all really think Kohli wouldn't come on?,2
"I trust Kohli, he go this!!!",0
Bumrah will do this for MI,2
If kohli hits now we might have to create a redemption thread for him I guess,2
Man I've got some hope back after watching kohli walk in,7
I think the super over will end up in a tie.,2
"Imagine people in the thread saying Kohli shouldn't be out there

Dude having 3 bad innings doesn't mean he isn't one of the GOATs",2
Out of form Bumrah vs out of form Kohli,5
Sunny G still thinking about the 100..,3
"It's all fault of that misfield. Smh, it would have been an easy win. Praise Saini tho 🙏🏽",3
"Whatever happens, it takes some gut to walk out there after a 3(11)",2
"This is gonna be a great over, win or lose",1
Bumrah please,1
Abe chutiye dj chup ho ja lodu,3
I predict four doubles,1
Bumrah in his current form will find this difficult to defend but Kohli isn't in the best of forms either. If they can get ABD off strike they have an outside chance.,2
LET'S GO KOHLI AND AB.,1
Kohli gonna hit boundary first ball he face,1
Please have abd on strike,1
Inb4 Kohli 2(4) AB 7(2) we win,2
Everyone shiting on bumrah ... Hmm,1
This is absorbing stuff!,1
king kohli about to prove his haters wrong,0
They're just gonna run singles/twos. No need for sixes and fours after that shit batting by MI.,2
India’s best bowler vs India’s best batsmen,2
What if they tie the superover?,2
Ab and kohli were bumrahs first wickets and ab smashed him today.. it's a beautiful triangle,2
Pietersen the real meme king,3
Please I can’t stand pieterson any longer,3
Fuck yeahhhh.,1
Was it wise for Kohli to bat given his form?,3
Abd and virat v bumrah is this a fb scenerio,6
Inb4 these madlads stroke the ball for 4 doubles.,8
"Kohli is gonna win it for RCB, get back to form, hit 5 centuries and win the IPL. A man can dream.",19
Hope they will be milking 2's here since kohli is out on the field,10
"Doubting best batsman 
Lamo",5
KP hyping it up even more!,2
Super v lmao,3
dont make it haar cb,2
No ball incoming,5
Mr 360,6
Kohli bringing himself out to bat despite scoring 3(11). Admittedly it *shouldn't* matter but still a weird choice,14
Imagine the memes if Kohli blocked 1,11
Great yorker first up,2
We need a wicket here. They’ll inevitably get a boundary,6
They do say class is permanent and form is temporary. But everything I've seen with superovers suggests you go with form.,9
First superover isn't over and they've been at it talking about the second one,8
"aadisi nodu beelisi biLisi nodu uruLi hogadhu

T: No end to our miseries one way or the other :(",9
Bumrah vs Kohli let’s gooo,2
well played ishan bro !,1
Come on KOACH.,1
Boomrah to trap Koach for 5 balls.,3
"3 off 11, eye not in. Playing a yorker king. Should have gone with Finch.",5
Mankad him,3
Every one talking about fucking rhythm & Ishan. Pollard was on strike for 4 balls in the super over.,2
Damn bumrah with a. Perfect Yorker,2
probably the best thing that could’ve happened for rcb,1
Did the commentators call Kohli Koach?,4
"Please not another super over, I have a meeting in 10",5
Are BC ye yorker match me daal deta,2
Remember Super over where Kohli win it with his running between the wicket for India?,1
Right on the money,2
Koach vs Bummy,4
There's the Bumrah we know and love,5
Yorker 1 done,3
Target kohli now,1
Come on kholi redeem yourself,2
best runners in the business,1
I mean an on form bumrah is scary but an on touch kholi or abd can finish this match easily.,1
I'll gild this post if mumbai wins.,5
Ye madarchod DJ,6
Best vs best,1
This is why I love the IPL. Two of India's best against each other.,7
https://twitter.com/JimmyNeesh/status/1310639076291293184?s=20,2
"At one point of time, not too long ago, only Bumrah could have defended a score of 7 in superover.",2
Reminder that RCB win on boundary count if tied again,4
The tuk tuk strategy,1
"Narial todo koi.

Bumrah bowled the yorker.",1
Almost 2k comments during super over,3
Why RCB why! Why can't you just win the games like normal people.,1
Scenes if Koach hits a six lol,3
Kohli will try to do this with singles.,1
Atlast koach vs boom boom.,3
Lbw,1
Yes we've had a super over...but what about second super over?,3
Kohli is hitting this ball for a four.,3
"Eeek.

Fuck off MI.",6
"I want RCB to tie this score and lose by boundary count 
 
We are cruel mofos",0
Koach gonna become Tewatia.,2
I remember when Bumrah bowled a no-ball and still won a Super Over,4
"If they win, Kohli gonna be like the dude who does fuckall and then scores the winning penalty",7
Redemption time for Kohli,2
I can’t wait for the mr Nags video after this thriller match lmaoooo,4
They are doubting worlds greatest batsman,1
Kohlis going to hit a 6,1
Koach pls,2
just need one bad ball,2
I hope kohli gets this through. Will do his confidence wonders,6
Big delivery this,2
Kohli will either be a genius putting himself in here or it will be a disaster.,4
Shit,2
There is no need for commentators hyping this one,1
Love you Boult!!❤,3
🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿,2
Trent is such a clutch fielder in pressure moments fuck me,14
Great fielding by El Boulto!,1

Great fielding,2
Trent Boult is such a good outfielder,6
I don’t even support these teams but I am on the edge of my seat,12
I have a feeling there's going to be another super over,10
GONE,2
By rcbs standard that was a 4,3
ABD please hit a Six and get us out of this misery,2
Delivery was pretty shit .,3

Show me a better script I'll wait,6
No way. Is RCB still gonna lose after this.,2

I bet Sharma Ji is thinking of Vada Pav.,6
Boom boom bumrah,1
i hope kohli doesnt do antics if they win this..getting 6 off 4 should be child's play.,3

Not out,3
RCB LOLOLOL,3
"You know if this is overturned, ABD gets angry and smashes a 6 next ball",2
ABD let us down...not koach WHAT,2
Where's the Take it forward joke?,2
IPL has gone absolutely mental this year. Every game is absolute scenes,6
Being able to cheer for Bumrah for once is rather satisfying. What a ball that was,4
Douball Check,1
The umpiring is consistently shit as expected.,4
haha. Don't see AB fuming like that usually. Turning into Kohli,4
Guys - get ready for super super over,6
FUCK OFF,2
Sunny asks if there was a referral in super over and we get it here. Coincidence? I think not,3
Arrey madarchod ab to band kardo nakli awaz drs me,5
Length bowl with pace is Suicide,2
Could be Dead ball,-1
Lol not out,1
Abe chutiye out kaise dediya umpire,5
AB's innings was a fluke anyway. Bumrah was out of touch and AB was capable enough to capitalize it. But that's just a pale shadow of old AB.,2
[Drinking this lovely cricket themed beer](https://i.ibb.co/6bwT0Tx/PXL-20200928-181238270.jpg),8
Not out. Clearly,3
How is there DRS in a super over?,7
Sunny G cumming rn,5
F L A T   L I N E,9
Insane ball tho,3
Sunny G is a time traveller confirmed. He asked if referral has ever been done in a super over,7
One thing is sure from this drs AB didn't watch the ball,3
What kind of jackshit umpiring is this ffs,2
Not even helmet. What was that sound of?,5
(ง ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)ง,12
Not out 😏,1
Not out,6
"DRS in super over

This is fucking new even for the script writers lmao",5
KP must have been absolutely hoovering up gear before commentating on this,2
One more super over,1
Not out,1
Brilliant delivery nonetheless!,2
That's why RCB should have sent in Padikkal with AB.,8
Let's go second super over,2
How many more twists in this game . This game will put the race franchise to shame,4
The basically bullied the umpire to give out.,3
I wanna have as much fun as Sunny G has,3
**FUCK YEAH**,1
What did it hit???,1
Good lord. My heart can't handle this.,1
DOT BALL,1
The fuck you need it one more time? Just for the sake of it?,1
Tf did the umpire hear,1
What's the boundary count incase this is a tie too?,-1
Bruh horrible call from the umpire. It literally touched nothing.,1
Where is your no ball Bumrah when it’s needed by Kohli ??,2
"Kohli should go out on a high imo, should've retired pre lockdown",3
Lol what's with umpires just giving decisions straight away for nothin,1
There wasn't even any sound ffs,1
These umpires are SOLD. Even if the players don't appeal they give the batsman out. Happens ONLY with MI,4
Kohli changing bats lmao,6
"Fuckkkk man I can’t take all this pressure anymore pls Ab end my suffering,just finish  it off",1
"This years scriptwriter is pretty good ngl 
 
who tf thinks of review in superover",10
This is such a perfect bouncer,1
"Either way, Dot ball :( 


FUCCKKK",1
Is the TV umpire voice input absolutely necessary ?,0
Umpire chutiya op,2
Ohhh too good to be true,1
"If it's not out, it has to be a wide no?",1
Just how far away from the bat does the ball need to be for them to not go to ultra edge? Always find it funny when they say “ball is close to bat”,4
Mumbai lose on boundary count if it's tied again,3
What a fucking ball that was,4
BC ho gaya check. It’s not out obviously. Bat is in other horizon.,5
2-0 off 3. Boundaries next,3
bumrah will bowl a no ball,6
All the comments about umpires playing for MI lol,4
Bumrah has woken up,5
6 off 3 with ABD is fine,4
C'monnnnnnnnnnn,2
These innings are identical ffs,3
I'd rather be held to my word than see us lose,2
Should've just gone for the yorker mate,2
How the fuck is the match bot commenting?,3
Poor ball Bumrah!! What is you doing?,3
"I said it here boys, so long ago : [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j1armi/match_thread_10th_match_royal_challengers/g6z1lk1?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",1

Oh thank god,2
Umpire victim of peer pressure,8
I want this over to be a tie too,3
[Srini Mama](https://i.imgur.com/Dddfbfu.png) sends his regards.,0
What's Rohit doing. Dumb decisions after one another.,1
I'm gonna cooooooom,1
"This is second bouncer in the over!!

Shouldn't it be a no ball?",2
My heart is beating so fast,1
Rohit always looks so sad in the field man.,2
Tied super over please,8
"If reviews are used up in an innings, can the same team still review in a super over?",1
YESSS,2
Wasn't that the 2nd bouncer ?,1
Let's go for another superover,4
I will never doubt King kohli if they can manage a win here. I need this for my own heart,-1
monkaW,2
Tough luck Bumrah!,2
This bumrah is so shit,-1
Bouncer and no fine leg? WTF Bumrah?,3
Another couple of feet and it was match over.,3
Lmao what field placement is that,2
This third umpire is so crap.,2
Next ball wicket!!!,2
Ambani bc stop buying umpires lode otherwise I wont recharge my Jio number next month.,9
Another Super Over?,2
Second Super Over pls,2
"f*ck yeahhhhhhh... i am exhausted..dude, this is literally nerve wracking",2
Do you get two bouncers an over?,3
AB swinging blindly,3
Superover again,1
Koach is there on the pitch so that he can celebrate the win. Nothing else.,4
C’mon ab you beauty,0
Need a wicket,1
did bumrah forgot how to bowl yorkers,3
"rohit removed fine leg, better than kohli??",1
Poor field placement by vada pav,4
It's a stupid delivery with that field,5
I'm gonna have a heart attack this young,6
IPL has so many close encounters and comebacks because the players are shit,-3
Anything better in this world than this disgusting team losing? NO,1
No ball please,1
And crashing into MI dugout ...,2
Please run two.,2
RCB for the love of God win this fucking game,5
That is A+ shithousery,4
Surely he's taking 1 to give kohli,2
Take the single!,2
hard luck Bumrah! fuck MIndians,1
I'm an atheist but god,8

Come on bumrah,1
Feel like pure shit just wish it was an odd year.,6

Talk about a cracker of a match !,4
Up to captain to get 1. 1 run.,1
With it already ffs,1
this boundary was like when you use the wrong approach to reach the correct answer,5
If Kohli wins this match..... Will be the perfect redemption arc bro,1
Who has more boundaries? WHO HAS MORE BOUNDARIES?,2
Both super overs have been brilliant,1
"Holy fuck

First ever super super over",3
Kohli's agnipariksha here,3
Don't fuck it up now Virat,1
"Just so you know, if this is a dot, SUPER OVER 2",1

Damn bumrah... I guess 8 was too small even for you.,1

Scenes if Koach fails to take one.,4
The commentator said if it’s gonna draw there will be one more super over 😮,3
Kohli redemption arc,1
"Boundary count back, lads?",1
At least the Bumrah yorker is back.,3
That terrible bouncer would be the difference,5
KING WILL WIN THIS,1
if koach fucks this up...RIP him,6
Dude is literally one of THE best yorker bowler and yet chose to go for three bouncers just because of one compilation of ABD struggling with bouncers,7
Both bumrah and Saini have been superb...,5
WE! WANT! ANOTHER! SUPEROVER!,6
It's another super over in case of tie?! Wtf,4
Still a great over you have to say from Boom,1
It's time for koach to be the hero. I see so much potential in that guy.,2
Kohli to hit the winning runs? How about Bumrah yorks him out?,2
My heart can't take another super over. Just somebody win this pls,2

Will Viral Kilo redeem himself? Or get out and prove his detractors? Stick around to find out!,4
Kohli choke job is desperately needed,3
At least ambanis getting some exercise 😂😂😂,6
ABD gonna do a super man dive,2
At least they took it to the last ball despite a low score to defend,2
What if this draws??,1
Man my heart beat is off the charts,3
Great game but with RCB as underdogs for the good of the game. Also let it sink in Bumrah almost defended 8 of 6 on his off day,5
Bumrah vs Kohli it is,1
Super Super Over,2
Next ball wicket and double super over,1
Only Bumrah will make such a low target seem nail-biting. Whoever wins I hope Bumrah gets his mojo back.,3
If it’s a wicket they will be tie in boundaries as well!! Atleast according to dugout comm,1
What happens if tie,1

King Koach Kohli wins it for RCB. #masterklass,2
"All of you slagging King Kohli in the match thread. No contribution with the bat, average captaincy, zero with the ball. But when he gets a chance, he gets it done.",12
Nooo this isn’t the meme I was hoping to enjoy today,5
Yesssssssssssssssss,2
He's going to hit above,2
I can sleep peacefully now,8

RCB tried their absolute best to lose it,10

Ipl is not good for my heart,9
Turns out RCB were the Tewatia,5
kohli carry rest of rcb did nothing,7
"Kohli carries RCB to win, what a legend!",8
Only RCB could do this. Go from an easily winnable position to a losing position to finally winning,11
Feel for kishan,4
KOACH REDEEMED HIMSELF! GG!,2
Kishan man of the match. Sundar player of the match. Good game overall,1

At least this has zero effect on our NRR,9
Navdeep Saini man of the fuckin match,7
Great battle between the world's best in both departments in that over,9
We win it. Somehow we did it.,11
Bumrah decided smartly to let his captain look good. He read the 48 laws of power.,11
i feel so happy for Kohli man.,11
"my man, he did it",4

This kid of victories leave you charged up or drained?,4
"Thank you for finishing the match Koach, I had a meeting in 10 minutes",7
I feel bad for ishan kishan,5
Maybe that’ll get Kohli going for the rest of the tournament,8
Man this game will be the end of me,4
Ab is about to cry,12
Koach kept the ball on the ground. A lesson for Mayank to do only what is necessary.,11

But happy for RCB.",4

DID....WE JUST FUCKING WIN? I CAN FINALLY GO PEE NOW.,39
What a game! We've had two fantastic games in 2 days.,9
How did RCB almost lose the match somehow managed to tie it and then win the super over?,9
The rub of the green is with RCB this IPL.,13
"This IPL is the most interesting one we've ever had, no completely one sided matches yet

E. Right, there were some here and there but still better than previous years",12
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SEASON'S IPL,13
Rcbians feeling like parched earth that receives rain. Yay a victory.,8
Mumbai going to unleash their full fury on us. Pray for us y'all.,6
MI should have won it but they screwed it up by not sending Ishan Kishan.,3
Jo jeet ke haar jaye aur phir haar ke jeet jaye use RCB kehte hai,6
Ooh what have we witnessed,4
Motm?,3
That Anushka prep finally paid off,14
Did bumrah ball two bouncers in. an over or the second one wasn't head high bouncer ?,6
First boundary for kohli this ipl,5
Feel for Kishan man. What an innings from the young lad and Mumbai management proceeded to piss it all away.,8
Virat Man of the match,5
Good game lads. Almost pulled it off. Also I'm not crying,12
RCB are Atlanta falcons of IPL.,1
"**insert megamind meme**

 he did it",1
Is this worth it? Lol!,2
The last two matches have destroyed my blood pressure,5
"First boundary for kohli in this ipl, what a time to get it",11
All thanks to Pavan Negi,5
This fucking tournament,6
Thank you for this level of happiness ❤️❤️❤️❤️,4
Whatever the result is poor fielding is a winner,4
"Is virat the best player of yorkers in the world?
 P:S: this question has nothing to do with malinga(psst: it actually is)",1
In your face haters!!!,4
Saini and mehela jayawardene should be man if the match.,2
"If I wore a heart monitor, doc would be sus why I peak every night at around 11.30",9
Udana and Zampa are lucky charms.,3
Kishan ka kat gya (feel bad for him),5
MoM should be Saini,3
"I just feel relieved for Kohli, TBH. Imagine the abuse he would have recieved if he got out on that last ball.",18
Koach gets the last laugh!,16
"Wow, what a game.",5
I stopped watching after 13 overs and just came back to this. Wtf how tf did they do so terrible the first 10 overs and then chased like 90 from 30 balls?,6
Ishan should be the MOTM,4
This is going to go into the archive of IPL CLASSICS. what a game.,12
appreciation comment for Ishan and press F in the chat for MIndians!,4
KIshan should have been out there in the Super Over. I will die on that hill,7
Gotta feel for Kishan. GG.,9
FeelsBadMan for Ishan,10
What was that no fine leg bullshit,6
You literally can't predict anything this ipl,10
2 back to back banger matches. What an amazing tournament so far,10
Rohit Sharma is fat and rubbish,-14
Man that was tense,7
I will literally burn down Dubai stadium if they give the man of the match award to an RCB batsmen. it is either saini or sundar. No questions asked.,14
"Another crazy stupid match, a joint and some Tash Sultana music in the background. 2020 finally seems to be turning around for me",5
Kohli has shut all of his trolls up for now,4
"The real winners at the end of the day was cricket and us, the followers of cricket! What a match!!🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 Back to back.",22
Saini gamechanger for penultimate over and super over. Could have been over before this the way MI were going,5
Classic game,4
"Absolutely stupid Super over batting performance by Hardik and Pollard who was otherwise great. 
This will hurt",6
RCB just need to look at their catching and they will win the tournament lol.,14
they actually managed a win wtffff,7
"Kohli shat the bed just so he could hit winning runs.  


Koach = Kaptaan = PIG3 confirmed",14
"Everything else aside, Saini is legit. Should definitely be ahead of Umesh in the India pecking order.",28
IPL is not good for your heart I’m tellin you,24
Goddamn. Bumrah almost defended 8 against AB and Kohli,26
"Ae Negi sit down, idiot.",4
We did it...relax...relax,9
This season has been amazing so far. I need some anxiety meds.,18
"Got to give it Kholi. Out of form, has dropped catches in the prev game still showed up to bat.",20
MoM - Saini. plz do justice for a bowler.,5
Commentator: Super V wins it for RCB,9
Credit to MI though for at least trying. Should have sent IK for the super over but whatever. Kinda confirms if RCB scores below 200 they will lose lol.,15
THE CURSE IS LIFTED,14
First loss for bumrah in 5 super overs,10
First time ever Bumrah has lost the Super over,10
What's one over eliminator?,1
" 

**Jasprit Bumrah's Super Overs for India/MI**

13/1 vs NZ Wellington 2020 (Won)  
8/0 vs RCB Dubai (Lost) \*",13
Definitely glad I made the switch from watching the footy gotta love the thrills of a super over,9
Kishan should be MoM,9
being an RCB fan is so fuckin draining,17
"I will stop watching ipl, my father is cricket enthusiast and heart patient",21
"Bowling Saini in the super over! That was a genius, tactical move by Kohli!",13
Jis team me New Zealand ka khiladi ho woh super over kabhi nahi jeet sakte,13
200D chess by Kohli to finish the game himself,8
The UAE pitches are fucking crazy,6
What would have happened if the Super Over was a tie?,3
"Fuck this shit

This isn’t good for my health",16
Kohli's first boundary of this season!!!,25
should never have sent hardik. management has been absolute shit with decisions.,6
Do mine eyes deceive me? RCB in the top 4?,9
[removed],5
Kishan deserves MoTM fight me,5
Rohit should captain Indian XI: puts no fine leg while bowler is bowling bouncers!,3
Gotta feel bad for kishan though. Kept the whole game together for MI,17
"Back to back great matches.

IPL is really the best T20 league",15
"Koach was practicing for super over all this time, 8d strategy.",47
"Bad decision to give the 17th and 18th overs to spinners. Pollard was gonna eat them up. 

Why didn't Dube bowl like he did in the last 2 games?",11
"I thought Rohit was a infinitely better captain then Kohli, and he should be made the limited over captain of India? Kohli haters in shambles",11
LOL NEGI celebrates the hardest,12
Saini deserves Player of the Match,7
Loss is always painful but much better with you BCs 😢 😢 😢  .,7
RCB really missed AB and Finch in the outfield today. This match should have been over in the 17th over had they caught well. But a win's a win.,22
"that bouncer was useless, he was bowling yorkers beautifully",12
What on God's earth is RCB?,15
"Gotta feel sad for Ishaan! Couldn't complete his century, couldn't take the team cross the line! Sad man.",18
Kishan should be given MOM atleast,14
Neck to neck match,10
"I just started watching cricket mid world cup last year and then joined this sub later . So I was wondering why everyone was memeing RCB, now I know",65
"Fuck me, what a match. I can now officially say every single RCB match I have watched, they have won, clearly signalling I'm the good luck charm they need

Also I hope people don't forget the dubious batting and captaincy from Kohli here; sure they won in the end, and he hit the winning runs, but he is largely responsible for why they came so close to losing it. Definitely needs working on",81
GGWP MI,1
Ok guys time for a casualty count... please step up,20
Jai ho,6
"Tell me something that gets more dramatic than this, extraordinary stuff once again. This IPL keeps on delivering.",34
Imagine being a neutral cricket fan and watching ipl,27
"MI so close and yet so far.

Why did they not send Kishan in super over?!",10
"Even Brohit and Pollard was a much better option than fucking Hardik, bad super over decisions.",23
ask rohit why didnt he ishan and he came instead,9
Proud of the guys! We saved the NRR!,27
"Guys, let's us all take a moment for Mr Ishan Kishan. Felt really bad for him today. Hats off to him😅😭",30
"So this is it where all things flip,Bumrah realises this and gets back in form, and Kohli back to his old self I guess?",23
Fixed? Scripted? Who gives a shit? As long as it gives me the chills,22
"What if 2nd super over was also tied?

We go back to boundary count?",13
cant wait for all the saini > bumrah takes.,10
third place babbbbyyyyy,35
Ishan Kishan scored bloody 99 and lost. Virat scored that one lucky run and won. Cricket is indeed a weird game.,30
"Jasprit Bumrah's Super Overs for India/MI

"Yuzi to Pollard: Bahut Marunga tujhe.

T: I will beat the shit out of you.

😂😂😂😂😂😂",5
"Even Kohli has had enough of the memes, today's match will shut them up for a while",13
I just don't understand this bullshit commentary. Ashish is criticising Saini who executed 4 perfect yorkers and praising Bumrah for his one better yorker. Why do they have to be so biased all the time?,29
"Dammit, I should have went to sleep when Mumbai lost 4 wickets, instead of getting excited after those sixes and heartbroken again in the end :( Respect for Kishan, you deserved that 100....",22
"Well, I am going to sleep with the biggest smile on my face!",27
"I need to stop drinking coffee while watching RCB, can't handle the heart rate spikes like this",27
My jaw is locking from the stress here,12
Fuck you rcb... You're gonna kill me,18
Feel for MI though. GG.,13
This IPL is fucking GOATED,23
"RCB won but should not have gotten to this stage from 16th. Virat will be doing Pablo meme tonight. 

Awesome game <3",24
Ishan Kishan must be screeching inside,16
Should be illegal for RCB and Arsenal to play on the same day tbh,26
"DC,RR,RCB,KXIP 

are locked for playoffs 

This is 2020!",26
Sundar MOTM,8
"Kohli is the world's best for a reason. Finally some luck RCB's way.  
What was that decision? I seriously don't buy into fixing but umpires almost always favor MI in those crunch situations. Same shit happened with Dhoni in the first game. Thank God for the review.",15
The highlights editor must in the uploading process. The highlights vid get online fast.,9
This IPL is giving me more anxiety than 2020. Ffs,22
RCB is Meme God!,16
This is the reason why IPL is the best in the world. Drama Masala and thrillers. Who doesn't love those...,31
"Doesn't even matter we lost, what an amazing game. Kishan you beaut!",26
Kohli and abd vs Bumrah in a superover is a memory to cherish,56
"Que the ""IPL's fixed"" pricks",19
I FORGIVE YOU 2020!,9
Honestly? MoTM should go to Sundar. What a spell,14
I thought we could recover some of the run rate lost from Punjab. But no...,17
This countdown of Dhoni’s knocks is so annoying IMO,8
"Felt really bad for Kishan. Played an important role, got out at 99 and couldn’t save the team. Unfortunate I guess😭",23
"My uncle just had a question: Why do IPL tends to have so many super overs?  

And the conclusion he reached himself: Match fixing.",25
So RCB batsmen have to score 200+ every match to have a chance of winning,51
"Just looking forward to the RCB games at Sharjah! 12,15 and 31 October vs Kolkata, Punjab and Hyderabad resp.!",17
[removed],7
IPL matches are so much better than most IT20 matches,27
"Tbh, that was an excellent over from Bumrah.",30
r/cricket in shambles,21
"Hello? Yeah, Hi Bumrah. 
It is me. Your inner conscious.
You just bowled a bouncer to ABD.
But he missed it while trying to hit it with intent™.
He can push that ball to fucking Yemen if you do that again.
But you know what would be funny.
Bowling the same fucking ball again!",64
RCB and winning under pressure. Lol. What have we come to?,22
Nobody is talking about Sundar.. 12 runs in 4 overs.. wow,46
"If IPL is fixed, the dude writing the script is a fucking Legend!!!",86
"Well it's an odd year so my expecttions as an MI fan is null anyway. Great game though. India's going to kill it at the death with the likes of Saini and Bumrah at the T20 WC though. Incredible bowling talent for India. Even Sundar, 4 over 12 runs on this ground against MI is insane.",31
"Though the team management's decisions should rightly come under the scanner, the onus of blame should land pretty heavily on the mumbai top order. 22(25) left simply too much for the rest to do, even though they came heroically close to it.",6
How long do I have to wait for Dhoni to play again. The guy is just full of meme potential.,14
I swear to God I  shouldn't be watching RCB games not good for my anxiety,23
2020 continues to be wild man.,12
Royal Chrodinger's Bangalore it is.,12
Chapter 1 of Virat Kohli's redemption arc. Yes!,21
This IPL season has had some bangers already,13
Pollard deserves motm.,4
Get off Bumrah’s back y’all,9
Virat Kohli bets bestmen ever.,3
This thread has gone crazy,4
[deleted],0
RCB has had a good Indian core since 2018 they have been just shitting the bed. With Saini coming into his prime and Sundar too I think it's going to be a good year for them especially if Koach regains form. They are looking scary.,22
Kiwis & losing super overs,11
I'm still shaking! What a game,9
Sundar 1-12 in 4 overs. Amazing performance,13
RCB vs CSK at Sharjah please!,8
"What a blockbuster contest this was.

The hype was real with this one.",6
[deleted],28
How important was that review from AB D though.,12
MoM should be Sundar for getting 1-12 in a 10 rpo match.,18
"I rest my case guys, RCB Is the most entertaining team and meme ipl team ever. *Mic drop*",16
Please stop all this Super V bs,7
"Apart from all the criticism, This is the reason we love cricket and this tournament. The unpredictablity, the drama, the nerves, the emotions, every single moment. Love this and live for this. ❤️",28
"It is usally the Indians who follow football religiously that make the claim ""IpL iS fIxEd"". I haven't seen anyone here make that comment tbh.",34
BREAKING NEWS - MSD confirms that he indeed gave Kohli CSK's luck in exchange for not sending him up the order against NZ in the semi-final. This was earlier speculated by many after CSK's terrible chasing tactics and RCB's surprising win but now we have it confirmed from the man himself.,8
Good cricket. This is good cricket.,3
Which was the better match? This one or yesterday's?,6
[deleted],-4
"It was so uncomfortable watching the staredown between Rohit and Kohli. 
What went sour between them so bad?
They were the best buddies coming up.",8
"Man saini's super over is ssly underrated , pollard and hardik, FOR MOTHERFUCKING 7, WHY IS NO COMMENTATOR TALKING ABOUT IT?",32
https://youtu.be/5PdXIHGvMpk :),5
"rcb isnt only the meme team we *wanted*, but *needed*",11
fuck you star sports select. we just won why are you tryna kill the mood,10
"10 overs - 61 Runs

20 overs - (142) Runs.

What sort of sorcery is this?",7
"I am  so fucking annoyed with KP commentary. How was Udana better than Saini KP? 

Just because he was a foreign player? He is trying too hard to show how only foreign players are important. fuck off KP.",19
"Everyone expecting Kohli to do well after this, wait for the cheeky 3(10) in the next match",11
Hope Koach bowls out spinners early and gets a bit more sensible. Prolly bowl one from Dube in the middle and save one for the guy having a bad day.,7
Just one look at the points table and you know it's 2020 and the world is upside down,12
Kohli did it when it mattered I guess,5
"Just 10 matches and so much entertainment.

This IPL is what 2020 needed.",14
That girl seems to have forgotten to wear her trousers,8
Thank God SRH is playing tomorrow. My BP will come back to normal,50
RCB fans: Fuck you and I'll see you in the next match,18
Is there still hope?,7
2 bouncers were allowed in the super over. Mumbai and Chennai have umpires on their side,-2
Unfortunately not everyone can do a tewatia,13
RCB 3rd in the table with a NRR of -1.45 lol,21
someone direct me to the depression thread plz.,10
"Kohli used his bowlers well, abd review in superover and Saini bowling superover was important.  
Gem of a match",16
CHAMPA is not that effective as I thought!,6
"If not for our horrendous death bowling we could have recovered some of the NRR. But, all teams are getting their asses whacked in the death.",8
"The elite three, DC, RCB and KXIP are all in the top four right now",22
lmao fucked run rate,4
Samson + Kishan > 100 x Pant,3
Can't understand why Rohit let Pandya play the super Over even when he himself have proved he bat's well in such situation. Pandya is not conditioned to play the pressure of Super over.,6
"Gurkeerat Mann must be a relieved man. 

Gave away at least 10 runs due to misfield. 
Crucial stage 6 over the bar that resulted in super over. 
And a misfield 4 in super over. 
But, most importantly held onto that catch.",19
"I went to sleep when mumbai lost a couple of early wickets but my dad woke me up when it looked like MI had a chance. 

I now have depression and cardiac distress. Thanks father",22
Virat to Rohit: Who's the daddy now?,5
3rd place in the table boysss. CSK who?,16
Kohli You made fun of me but I was practicing making single digits for this super over against bumrah.,11
I don't understand. How did rcb win?,5
Virat to his trolls : What now bitches?,-9
"Ishan kishan, Massive Respect",9
This is decent by even year MI. Looking forward to a 14 point fifth place.,8
I can think of 3 batsmen to replace Pant in the Indian team now,24
"*Sees points table*

*unzips *

Underdogs union",20
"I mean well have learned to keep our mouths shut till the last ball us bowled after yesterday. Now I have every right to say: utterly daft captaincy. 

Everyone knows you bat at your best after getting in and the only thing we are professionals at is watching the tv. Rohit is the athlete, yet cost the game cuz apparently he doesn't understand the basics.",8
You get excited by such matches and we'll calm you the fuck down with ours. We're SRH. We're the Peacekeepers in this mad mad world.,29
"Ah man Mark Nicholas is not like how I imagined him. First time seeing him and his face, have always heard his voice.",3
[deleted],25
Well played Mi but Rcb were just better at holding the nerves GG,8
"Guys can you believe it, just 10 matches and this season  we experienced almost everything. Lmao idk but this might just be the best season so far.",22
"I think bigger challenge for mi was abd and kohli's ability to steal singles and doubles in superover   
Still RCB did quite well today, picked best playing 11  
Bumrah making 8 runs look 18 was phenomenal   
Top ipl moment",12
For once I wanna see someone other than MI or CSK win the tournament,10
Is nobody gonna talk about how the umpire let bumrah bowl two bouncers in the over and then gave abd out so easily.,38
MArk Nicholas's voice doesn't suit his face at all,9
RCB can make folks feel better about 2020. What a team!,22
"Shout out to MI, the greatest T20 team of all time. Downvotes for speaking the truth aye?",0
Why you gotta do my boy Ishan dirty like that?,10
When was the last time we beat mi?,11
Throw that money in the managements face boi.,4
After all this drama from last two days we need a csk match to calm things down,46
"Repeat after me:
Naa pyaar mein naa vyaapaar mein, jo maza MI ki haar mein🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂",18
All current players underperforming while next gen players exceeding expectations,15
"Honestly, people don't appreciate the superover bowling enough, that restricted pollard and company to only 7 runs.",48
"The 2 changes to RCB team: Parthiv in for ABD. He keeps wickets and relieves ABD, and ABD takes catches in the deep. Also, we don’t need 3 spinners. Zampa out, Steyn back in",1
"Phew I'm exhausted. I'm off to sleep.

Last night's match left me sleepless, today's exhausted me to the core and I just want to sleep now.

Veeeeeeeery close save there, RCB. Need to work a LOT on the death bowling. It all means nothing if the last over gets smashed for 60+ runs. Nonetheless, better bowling than the last two matches.

Hats off to Saini for keeping his cool. Won the match for us there, and AB as usual delivered.

BTW, the opening partnership seems to be working very well right? So I have some doubts about Kohli coming in to open. Nevertheless, as a Kohli fan, would love to see get him fired up.

Good night lads, it was fun, just as much as it was tense. Meet yall tomorrow.",31
Wow all these batsmen and the best striker was Dube? Wow,15
"My dad went to sleep. Tomorrow I'm gonna tell him rcb won, and see his reaction after hi reads the newspaper",37
Luck is on our side guys. Looks like we (RCB) can reach playoffs,8
It’s all fun and games until Mukesh bhai pulls out his chequebook and makes the calls.,56

Proud that we didn't gave up half way through well played lads see ya tomorrow,14
Random thought this. Will CSK vs SRH be a big enough borefest to put this world into Infinite Tsukuyomi?,35

MoM Kishan or we riot,19
"HOLY DICK I tuned out in like the 9th over of MI's innings expecting a massive loss for them, so v surprised to see that it became a Super Over",16
"Intent makes these kinda games happen.

INTENT OP.",23
"Really happy for Finch, he's a excellent T20 player, hope he continues this form",30
I’m an RCB fan but I don’t know why I can’t feel happy,26
"Fucking RCB death bowlers still need some modifications, who they gonna bring now?",15
Lol even Mark Nicholas is trolling RCB now,27
we need to win at least half of our matches now,32
Ishan kishan should play all the remaining games of the tournament (not just based on today's innings ). He is such a treat to watch with all those clean strikes,39
RCB to CSK: Who needs NRR when you have POINTS baby!,51
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",15
Find yourself someone who talks about you like the way kohli talks about AB,38
Kohli you are a gem. What an outstanding person.,8
who is the woman in white dress they keep on showing?????,9
FUCK THE BATRIARCHY. Why is ABD the player of the match? Fuck this shit.,17
"Bumrah's consistency to bowl Yorkers at his will makes him so valuable, if he was Australian he would be named best bowler after Bradman",23
"AB was good, but Sundar was robbed as fuck out of MoTM",29
RCB can never get rid of Umesh(s) and Negis.,11
Wtf? Rcb won in super over? I started playing among us when Mi was at like 50/3 or something. I came back to match thread and shit what i just missed.,19
Pandya ko nikalo yaar,0
"I think we should try Coulter-Nile in place of pattinson next game 
 
Has a knack for picking wickets early on and it's something MI have struggled with",3
Whats up with Gavaskars cheek? Doesn't look too good..,-1
sundar is underappreciated as fuck. i wouldnt be surprised if kohli only gives him one over next game.,26
"Rcb poor fielding allowed mi to collect lot of boundaries,  game came close thanks to catch drops   
Gurkeerat was very poor today",14
"I'd be the happiest person on the planet to see DC, Kxip, RR and rcb in the playoffs",39
CSk should be taking notes about **true intent** the way MI fought back. No one gave up cowardly right in the middle of the innings.,26
Are we winning?,15
If we win all the games we can still qualify,44
Another gem added to MI RCB Rivalries!!,26
Damn KP and Gavaskar ripping into M. I decision of not sending kishan in.,11
we're almost as shit as csk on the points table rn. \*new wave of depression hits\*,18
"I hope CSK watched the last two matches on TV or at least learned about the word ""intent""",39
"Are you serious kp and gavaskar, not one statement about saini?",13
"It's weird not to hear coach repeat his ™ *15-20 runs short* line. The world is fucked up enough already, I don't want another continuity break.",15
"OK. Hands up! This IPL nonsense is wicked good fun.

I feel bad, personally, that I have a love/hate thing regarding certain teams. It's insane. So many dopamine hits in such a short period of time... 

It's, err, not cricket.",32
Thinking about changing my flair from KXIP to RCB,16
"2020 is truly wild. RR, DC, RCB, KXIP in the top 4 rn",33
What is the second highest score in last 5 overs if MI's 89 is highest,7
Need Coulter-nile. Where tf is he?,6
Ishan kishan in Super Over would have provided more value,7
"Mumbai will feel short of quality spinner towards the end of season, but their batting lineup is lit af now",5
Who's the lady commentator?,1
"Neroli Meadows, Sunil Gavaskar, Kevin Peterson. Guys, does anyone know why Mahanti is not seen for post match sessions nowadays?",6
We nearly had 3 centuries and all of them would have been scored by young Indian batsmen.,19
"Everyone is talking about the likes of Kohli,Saini and Bumrah now. But remember that Washington killed the chase with his new ball spell early in the PP. He has the best economical figures in this IPL so far.
4 overs - 12 runs - 1 wicket in a match where both teams hit 200+",40
everyone praising rcb bowling but no ones talking about how rcb conceded 90 runs in 5 overs in a ground that's not sharjah.,46
I just want to watch one match where RCB win comfortably by bowling second before i die.... Am i asking for impossible??,55
I turned off the tv thinking match is one sided..what the hell.happend here.,24
"Sunder was absolutely fucking brilliant,went on to give just 12 runs in 4 overs where both the teams have scored 200+. And he proved to be a mighty  difference between the two teams in this epic contest. Hard luck for Ishan though showed proper intent gotta give it to him.",30
[deleted],10
Sunder's spell was the difference,22
If you follow football even a bit you'll realise that this has been heck of a week. The underdogs in PL and Bundesliga have beat the best teams in their respective league. What a week has it been. Nah....what a year has it been. It feels like we entered an alternate universe on New year's Eve.,15
"Mumbai needs to win Matches with that batting line up, the department were we lack is Bowling. Lynn should be given chance",12

"A while ago India found Bhumrah in a super over, this time it found Saini. ~~--He was picked to bowl over Boult in the super over :o--~~",15
Once Bumrah gets his mojo back I am looking forward to the Saini-Bumrah pairing. Lethal at the death,17

"I have been a die hard RCB fan and have been following them since 2013 still I don't find any satisfaction in the match,the RCB death bowling is absolutely shit,I think saint was just lucky,giving away 90 in 30,what shit is that performance,18 runs an over,I will just wait for what Russel does to them in Sharjah,I bet of 120 runs given in last 7-8 overs",1
