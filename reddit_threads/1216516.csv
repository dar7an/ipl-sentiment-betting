"Want RCB to make it to playoffs this time! Wanted KXIP/RR too but that ship looks to be sailed. 

DC MI KKR RCB",-3
"Not a fan of either teams but wouldn't mind CSK win, just to be less embarrassed about the dying days of Dhoni's cricket career.",-11
"Tis the day lads

All I want is RCB beating CSK, playoffs are overrated anyways",16
Let’s gooo Bangalore. Csk should not win any match,6
RCB are huge favorites here hope CSK can somehow win,3
Can RCB meme again to give jadhav 50(30) so that he won't get dropped this season ? Stay tuned to find out.,12
Will Thali score today or be a flop?,-1
Looking forward to seeing my two heros on opposing teams.  Hoping both Parthiv and Dhoni can have great games,5
Don't really wanna see CSK lose again... But also really don't wanna see RCB lose again. I need them strong so that we can get an RCB vs DC final and have a new winner this season.,4
I dont wanna see csk and rcb winning. Whom tf do I support,-7
"Is there a better location to hold this explosive matchup than the Ring of Fire? Expecting some big fireworks today from Koach, ABD, and Chahal! Dhoni will show everyone why he’s so revered as well! Go thala!",2
"RCB when Padikkal scores single digit score: 0 victories
RCB when Padikkal scores double digit score: 3 victories",4
"If CSK win today, for one full day they'll enter the Top 4.",4
I am expecting atleast 15K comments 🤞.,1
"Ah, the Dhoni suxx circle jerk thread.",6
"Ah, yet another match to find a new way to lose (even if it's against RCB)",1
"I would really love if we don't start the ""Dhoni sucks"" template posts and everyone else complain about those said posts. 

But instead shit on any team which does terribly. It's RCB AND CSK, it's a win-win..... just follow the match folks.",4
How much are we betting that Dhoni and Fleming still don’t drop Jadhav?,5
Please let CSK win and let Bangalore be consistent in losing,0
Which moeen will rcb get today?,2
What would be the expected 1st inning score tonight?,1
I don't care who wins or loses just don't want to see any more of the 5 foot nothing man that CSK has been backing.,2
Battle of suckers for this season.,-3
RCB win toss to bat.,1
"CSK chasing again wtf

This has to be some record",5
No matter who wins the toss - CSK is always chasing this IPL,7
RCB won the toss and will bat. Imagine being MS Dhoni and not winning a toss in ages.,10
Glad this isn't happening in Bangalore. Match would have gotten canceled because of rain,7
Fucking hell this isn't fair CSK ARE ALWAYS LOSING THE TOSS,11
Morris in boys.,1
"7 matches, 7 chases for us.. Can't we just bat first for a change if we are going to lose anyway ?",8
JADHAV IS OUT. YASSSSS.,6
Kohli wins the toss? CSK gives all opposing teams luck.,0
CSK would have won at least two more matches if we got the chance to bat first,0
Jadhav still in?,0
"Bruh prediction time

CSK chase sucessfully and Dhoni comes back to form

He always fucks with RCB",9
Yes! Kedar dropped. Finally.,1
Excited about morris in RCB team,1
Jaggi in for Kedar.. Everyone happy noises?,11
"https://twitter.com/Thunderjunu18/status/1314824315578191872?s=09

Relive the memefest featuring Sir Jadeja and RP Singh back from 2013.",8
"Jagadeesan in place of Jadhav today, I can rest in peace now",24
Kohli won the toss and Dhoni lost? How long since that happened,7
"Debut vs RCB?

Congrats on the 50 bro",9
Excited for battle over which side can claim the title of meme team,2
Jagadeesan finally gets a chance! Hope he has a great game and gets backed by the team in future.,4
Finally here we go - Movable object vs Stoppable force.,73
Imagine if Jadhav does a 180 today.,1
"Awh man, no Jadhav. There goes the fun for being a neutral",5
"HOW THE HELL IS PARTHIV NOT SELECTED?

After a poor run of games they need an attacking batsman to score runs, should have selected Parthiv given he has attacking intent and is a match winner",0
Why am I celebrating the exclusion of Jadhav from playing XI  like a victory?,4
"With Kedar not playing, Dhoni's failure with the bat won't be hidden. He has to do well.",3
I bet Gurkeerat wont face one ball,2
A moment of silence for Jadhav memes,3
"You know your luck is running bad, when you lose tosses on the trot and then also lose the toss to Kohli of all people.",8
7 games in and Chennai still hasn't batted first,3
Udana Morris both playing. Siraj dropped. Excellent team changes.,1
I swear if Morris doesn't call anyone Bhenchod I'm Outta here.,2
"This CSK lineup atleast looks like it can give some competition. It's not the best they can do but it's better than what they've had until now, so far they've looked helpless.",5
"Wait, Koach admitted it was wrong to chase?",7
🦀🦀🦀KEDAR JADHAV DROPPED🦀🦀🦀,18
Bit disappointed that Siraj is dropped after a decent performance last game,5
Moeen playing?,1
Dhoni got a hair transplant didn't he,4
"The main thing to watch will be if Kohli and ABD can fire in this first innings. If they can come in and start hitting like they have in the past, CSK is going to severely struggle because of their slower starts in batting.",1
No Mo No Party,3
"So even Koach, a serial toss loser, wins the toss and chooses to bat against us. Fuck you 2020.",43
I wonder if they should have kept Moeen,1
"Jagadeesan my boy, show your mettle.",7
"One deadweight gone from the team, the other unfortunately is captain. Horrible from CSK. It's like watching a defenseless animal watching helplessly as it gets crushed by an oncoming truck. Nowhere to go, paralysed.",9
[deleted],8
"RCB just needs the wickets of at least two of Faf, Watson, Rayudu and then watch the RRR skyrocket.",3
"That's okay, not like I want chennai to bat first ever haha",2
Can someone fucking kick finch in his nuts again. The only time he was good in this ipl,1
csk chasing again? yup we're losing,1
CSK not having any matches in a ground that supports their spin and their terrible team selection is probably what will cost them their spot in the playoffs. CSK has banked on having matches at Chepauk where they can outspin their opponents but UAE has provided nothing for their spinners.,4
Lmao at the first match. How has Punjab lost that.,5
Only reason Kedar was dropped is cause CSK ain't big enough for two Thalas.,4
Is it just me or is Kohli's hair red? Since when did he become a closet redhead?,2
Battle of the memelords,2
"Hi Guys, Virat said this is not club cricket. Is it true?",3
"At this rate, CSK goes the entire season chasing.",6
"Koach did not bowl first this time, that is a relief.",3
All the best to both teams. Hope the better team wins.,3
The other thread is going through a mental breakdown,110
"Finally kedar dropped , while.punjab bottled the chase in a spectacular fashion ,let's see RCb can win or not",5
"You can take Karnatka players out of RCB, but you cannot take RCB out of them",4
Csk winning this as they don't have any scapegoat today.,5
No Jadhav today?? Are CSK for real?,2
Team main koi badlav? Any changes?,2
Both Kings (KXIP and CSK) playing like paupers,4
Inb4 jagadheesan hits his maiden half century and Jadhav packs his bags.,8
"We all know csks chasing records this ipl, lets do this bois 💪",5
"Watched punjab vs Kolkata as a neutral and still came out sad.

Now I want RCB to absolutely trash CSK and make me feel happy again.

  


  


Yes I am selfish and thanks in advance RCB",47
I’m ready to get hurt again,21
Still hungover from KXIP vs KKR,30
"Watching CSK and RCB clash is a sight, because their jerseys contrast with each other and the ground.",16
"""Kings"" name cursed this season",13
:crab emoji: :crab emoji: Kedar is not playing :crab emoji: :crab emoji:,4
"Lmao, no jadhav today",7
The other thread is probably on fire by now.,35
Dhoni has inherited Kohli's losing tosses ability.,27
Siraj did well in his first game. Why was he droppedm,2
"No jadhav, no fun.",8
"Strike rates are overrated guys. Believe me I am the Orange Cap.

PS - I know I posted in the other thread but it is just too golden not to be posted.",65
I hope the gods are good today.,1
Preparing for another heart break,4
"As an srh fan I want KXIP and Csk to win to make it easier for us to make playoff

KXIP lost, hopefully csk will make it up",6
"rooting for CSK this match, hope they do well",4
RR’s net run rate is a disgrace,2
Cheeky,5
Ravichandranath Chahar,7
KKR is the heist master this season.,30
Cheeky little mankad attempt by Deepak.,2
Chahar doing a Ashwin.. GG,6
Chahar trolling Finchy..,7
"In the afternoon we saw RCB beta choking up,now would we see RCB og lose or the Thala Senior Home team? Lettuce",3
Lool he tried the mankd,9
Lol chahar he hasn't even left the crease you idiot,2
LMFAAAOOOOOooooooo,3
Chahar doing an ashwin,3
First ball was also a wide ball,2
Ashwin to Chahar : Get rekt poser,3
That KXIP vs KKR match was fucking nail biting,2
"BC Chahar, Bowl wide and try Mankad is not a sound strategy",3
Finch be like : abey saale,6
Yoo RCB fuck these old farts,5
I’m still speechless,4
Always Finch yeah? Imagine every bowler starts doing it to him for bants,5
Finch wasn't even outside the crease ? Wtf chahar,8
That yellow helmet kinda looks like a mismatch with their jerseys,1
Fuck off trying to mankad someone comfortably in their crease*. Concentrate on your bowling and you might not have bowled a wide the next ball,1
how come finchy not taking this seriously lol,2
Chahar unleashing his inner Ashwin,5
Anyone here come from the previous match? What the fuck just happened LOL,14
"Last year r/nfl spent so much time shitting on the LA Rams that I kinda started liking them and now they're my second team


The same is happening with CSK this year... Usually I don't care much for them but seeing the hate and vitriol being thrown their way i now wanna see them do well",4
"I like this fear in the non strikers now, all thanks to our ethical mind™",4
The old Mankad with the batsmen a foot in his crease trick,1
Why is the Hindi commentary in this one so dead,1
"Fucking chahar, he was clearly in the crease.",8
"Chahar trynna pull an Ashwin 

But everyone knows only an Ashwin can pull an Ashwin",12
Humble request to the fellow Indians to call “that dismissal” as run out & not malign a particular indian legend’s name.,9
D Chahar you beauty. love the #intent for mankading,2
In paper RCB should win 8/10 times against CSK. In reality CSK will win 8/10 times. Sed RCB,8
I have new found respect for RCB after watching the previous match,9
Faf looks like V for Vendetta,2
"Still can't get over that finish. And to top it off the scenes if CSK lose to RCB

Ab mazaa aayega na bhiduu",14
That out swing was beautiful.,6
I never support csk because they have been successful enough but when I heard that dhonis daughter got rape threats because they lost the last game I feel sympathy for them and hope they get back into form here,4
Is Finch buff or thicc?,3
Too much respect for chahar,1
Dhoni looking a lil chonky,-1
Man Finch is struggling.,3
lol still cant get over the KXIP KKR match.,3
Nehra: there's no doubt about it,3
Finch struggling against outswingers too now,3
The moment Finch comes to bat it starts swinging ..Even in UAE.,10
""" he can swing both ways"" 

Nehra",5
Give him 2 slips,1
"Behenchod can we please kick nehra from dugout

chut adds nothing",2
Finch looks so clueless against Chahar tonight,1
Finch : what is technique?,3
Lol Faf,1
better beats than Dr dre,3
Damn good over Chahar.,3
I quit alcohol for the month. But these matches are not making it easy.,12
"Ashwin to ipl :
_There is an Imposter among us_ 0-0",1
RCB should lose this just because it will narrative parallel to the KXIP (Beta RCB) loss.,1
Inswinger incoming,3
Lots of swing for both Chahar and Finch,16
Chahar is twink,4
Chahar bowling like Bhuvi bowled at his debut,10
Finch vs McGrath,9
Man...Finch looks so out of form.,5
4 misses  lmao,4
Lol Finch on a green deck. Just target his pads,4
Finch wants to waste 5 to 10 balls before throwing his wicket away. Perfectly understandable,13
This is Test level swing tf,27
Some Swing bowling by Chahar. Finchy hasn't got a clue.,5
lmao why'd they do nehra like that,6
How is finch best t20 player in the world?,2
This is how used to bowl in EA,6
Little Sam. Come on boi take an early wicket.,-1
I just can't concentrate on this match. Can we keep discussing what happened between KKR and KXIP?,13
He can swing both ways... ಠᴗಠ,4
I can’t imagine what Dhoni must be going through knowing that the he got rape threats towards his daughter for not taking his team to victory,5
Lol nehra confronted in dugout,10
LOL. They talk about a bowling coach for RCB when Nehra is in the dugout. Ultimate bants,47
I'm loving Bravo's cyan shoes.,2
Current RR looks achievable for CSK so far.,8
"They should get finch outta there, replace him with Kohli. AB at 3, followed by Moeen, and others. Finch wastes way too many balls in PP and Kohli’s isn’t your 6 hitting number 3. His best use would be in PP, supported by his best IPL year when he opened.",3
"Why is Nehra in the dugout? Poor guy can't speak in English, why put him there?",10
"Fun fact: finch is gonna fuck up CSK today. And there is nothing you can do about it.


Edit: I meant with the ball",-3
Is Jagadeesan any good? His t20 numbers are meh.,1
Why is Finch struggling so much recently? This guy is an established batsman who's scored runs around the world..,10
Kedar is out with an upset tummy. Ate too many balls the other day,79
Why did it flash as wicket before the ball was bowled?,2
Anyone come from F1?,2
Switching rapidly between tamil and English feeds...slight change in graphics...the line up was never shown in Tamil commentary,1
No padikkal. Preserve finch.,3
Nehra lmaoo,9
"Dropping Siraj after he was the best seamer last game for RCB is a bit harsh tbh

Understandable bc it probably won't last, but harsh nonetheless",15
Dube is RCB’s 5th bowler?!,5
Can we just acknowledge the fact that Jadhav is not playing this match. I'm fuckin happy Bois.,15
"You have retards.

Then you have Nehra.",7
Nehra acting like a clown,12
Would give my right hand to be Nehra's buddy irl,8
Why were you the coach for them then twat.,7
Lol. Nehra trolling RCB better than all of us combined.,18
Finch looking like walking wicket,1
Nehra making sense ??,6
"CSK have to bowl well and take wickets according to KP

I thought the objective of bowling was to bowl pies and get hit for 6. I'm learning so much",7
Morris be looking Angela from office,8
This feels like day 1 of a test match with all this swing,3
Nehra's ranting against RCB. Incredible!!,6
2020 is so fucked that delhi captials are topping the table. Damn.,2
"With bhuvi injured , gives a good opportunity for chahar to get a long run for india ...Both similar type of bowlers , albeit bhuvi is a better death bowler.",4
"There it is, take it all out nehra ji",7
"For an International batsman like Finch, to see him play swing like that, without any foot movement whatsoever is kinda funny",7
We didn't give Gaikwad enough chances,6
RCB playing with only 3 foreigners?,1
"Fuck me,I switch from Hindi commentary and fucking Nehraji is sitting there also blabbering like an idiot.He is everywhere.",8
Nehra ripping into RCB... lol,7
Ashish Nehra isn't dugout quality.,2
Anybody who plays this shot well has terrific balance and technique,4
Shot boi. His timing is a delight to watch.,6
Obligatory “Is he the next Brian Lara?”,3
Nehrajiiiiiii,1
My man rly be comparing qdk with parthiv,6
[removed],5
You can expect Nehraji to drop some sauce on RCB and Sehwag on KXIP lol,4
How long has it been since a kanadiga has performed for rcb? Love to see padikkal play well,3
"I'm trying so hard to take Nehra seriously, I just cant",11
This is where you have to smash the ball so it loses shine fast and stops swinging,7
Wicket in this over,5
"If RCB don't win this year I'll suggest they change their name to RBC ,might get Koach that extra charge to win it.",2
"Stop calling him DDP u fuck, stop trying to be danny morrison",-1
Ashish Nehra killing RCB.,8
Chintu seems like a complete nerd,3
"Since Nehra is in the dugout, we just need to replace Scott and Lara with Murali Karthik and Sanju Manju. I can then watch this on mute",3
The dugout says Deepak swings both ways.Is this true 😂,0
Wait Dhoni is at #4 in the lineup? Wtf surely it should be Sam/Jagadeesan at 4 or 5.,3
Are we trying to meme Finch into form?,3
Can someone hit finch in the dick so he gets going please? Thanks,18
"Imagine being Tom Curran, Mitch starc, Mark waugh, David hussey. Incredibly talented. But not even the best athletes in the family.


Even funnier being Mitchell starc. Not even the second best athlete in the family.",9
Chahar can swing both ways right,1
"IF Padikkal enters double digit, he goes onto score a 50. 

Currently at 9\*",5
Finchy giving too much respect for csk bowlers,2
Can someone DM me the dugout feed link if they have it? Thanks a lot boys,1
I already feel like CSK will choke,0
"Chahar's hairstyle is smooth bc, I wish my hair looked like that",1
DDP is that what we’re calling him now?,1
"Today's win will help CSK to stay in the game.
Today's win will help RCB to assure atleast 4th place with CSK out of race.

As a CSK fan from Bangalore, I support RCB if it's not CSK in the playoffs.",1
Who's this Finch guy? Looks like he can't play shit and needs to learn foot movement,2
Game would've been washed out if it was being played in the Chinnaswamy.. got to be thankful for the desert environs I guess,1
Nehra shat on us really hard in dugout,4
What's the avg first innings score on this ground ?,2
Nehra deserves his own commentary option,7
Deepakchandra ashwin on the attack,1
Finch what the hell,1
CHAHAR YOU BEAUTY,0
"Ohh Deepak, u beauty",0
For fucks sake man finch,1
GOT HIM. Fuck YEAH! GET IN CHAHAR,2
Finch should be dropped,1
Is it DDP now? I didn’t get the memo.,1
Who was the guy who said Finch would fuck up CSK,6
Fucking drop finch. He is in shitty form,2
Finch looks badly out of form,4
"Drop finch ffs

Get in Parthiv Patel",2
"m i d d l e  s t u m p

What a sight!",1
Called it,2
No doubt I expected that to happen. Not surprised at all.,2
lol fuck,2
That wicket reminded me of ferrero rocher for some reason,1
Should be final nail in tha coffin for Finch. I don't think he will be selected anymore,-1
"Get Moeen in for this guy , hasn't been going well for him",2
What a beaut.,1
GOTHIMMMMMMM,1
Chahar's swing is such a treat to watch.. Giving all the vibes of Boobie those days!!!!,1
Typical,2
Finch is so fuckin bad with the inswing,2
"**2.5** Chahar to Finch, OUT, **knocks out middle stump!** Finch was utterly out of sorts tonight and it shows with this wicket. **13-1**

AJ Finch  b Chahar 2 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22",1
God that was a satisfying delivery. Chahar has been so impressive,1
Finchy has no clue wtf is going on... Time for RCB to make a change next match.,2
Finch is useless,2
Why do we keep playing useless finch. Just open with Moeen I guess.,2
Classic Finch. Was never a test batsman.,1
Finch and Maxi do fuckall in IPL,4
Why finchy why,3
"There it is, world's best t20 batsman",8
DC you beauty 💛💛💛,4
"Lol Finch

No footwork, wild swing, loses middle stump",6
Finchy still on form.,3
How the fuck someone who's so good at international level plays like this in IPL?,7
RIP to people confused on last match's thread.,5
Why did he wait 10 balls to bowl an inswinger?,4
The length and line has been brilliant from CSK bowlers.,3
Serious Bhuvi vibes eh finch?,2
That was terrible from Aaron Finch.,1
That’s the most perfect ball Chahar could ask for,1
Aussies having a wonderful ipl,5
Fuck off Finch. That's not how you play when you have so much game experience.,5
How does finch do so well everywhere except the ipl,4
"Yeah, I took that wicket 😎😎😎",0
Finch buddy What was that!,1
Such a terrible shot.,2
King is in.,1
I dropped Faf for Finch for my fantasy team. It was a gut feeling. I guess I'm sick,2
"Next game PP in for Finch,Moeen in for Gurkeerat",4
The sardarji on the cred app's fan board looks like a slow kid trynna act in school's annual day dance.,1
Wow who could've seen that coming,1
Why can't all teams pick players who actually take IPL seriously?,5
That’s a disgraceful shot for an International opener,3
CSK only need two more wickets,0
"Another game, another Finch failure.

What does Parthiv need to do to get a game.",2
[deleted],5
Seems like Finch is thinking of how Kxip choked,3
Chahar you beauty!!,0
I hate to say it but finch needs to be replaced. There's a reason he's played for 8 different teams. He just doesn't click in the IPL,6
Finch has turned into trash,1
Bring in parthiv he scores atleast 20-30 runs ffs and keeps wickets.,4
Who was that guy that said Finch was going to score big? Call him. lul.,3
"Yeah Finchy not gonna sleep today



Gotta call Langer",1
Fucking Finch has been real scratchy this IPL,2
RCB don't learn from their mistakes. They keep playing Finch. He has been useless in this year IPL. I would have preferred Moin Ali instead of him anytime.,2
I'm dead inside can't shitpost after the game I saw earlier today,3
What the hell A A Ron,3
CSK will do all this.. like super amazing bowling and will still manage to lose😶😟,2
Finch out for Philippe,3
"Massive gap between bat and ball, he had no clue of his off stump",2
That's one way to look like a numpty.,1
Finch is going to run out of IPL teams to play for,2
Maybe open with Parthiv and get moeen in the middle order for gurkeerat.,3
Pretty sure Finch is done,0
Finch has to be benched. Been given a long rope,1
Just bring Parthiv in. Can't do much worse than Finch. That way you can bring Moeen into the side and remove the keeping burden from ABD.,2
"My girlfriend cheated on me so I had to D Chahar.

(not OC unfortunately. Wanted to share cuz it was so good)",6
RCB should replace finch with Parthiv atleast he plays the powerplay well,1
"Put Finch out of his misery, replace him with someone else in the next match",1
Finch eating up an overseas spot. Phillipe will also help easing the load of AB.,5
Now I know how and why Finch got to travel across all ipl teams,8
Wtf is it with Finch and Maxwell being world class T20 international batsman but dogshit in IPL where the quality of bowling is lower,7
"Finch horrendous batting. Everyone has figured out his weakness and now days he can’t even accelerate,he can’t even tonk it in the powerplay. Gosh!",3
Incoming Kohlapse,3
Finch is such a mediocre batsman but I love the guy as a person.,3
"Lol DDP, is this what we call him now? Self high five then.",1
[This](https://reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j8jetr/_/g8bmrl2/?) aged so well.,7
Team we beat 2 days ago n team we will beat 2 days after playing today lol,-2
Damn.. Chahar was all over Finch in this match.,4
To people who wonder why Finch has played for every single franchises that’s why,7
I still believe in Finch but this was low tier trash.,7
Ashish Nehra just wanna sucks Dhoni's cock eh?,4
"For next game

Parthiv > Finch

Moeen > Gurkeerat",6
I have feeling Koach will edge the ball to gully,4
"Deepak Chahar should be a permanent member in the Indian ODI and T20 squad.

Back up him more, feels like he won't let you down.
But, will Virat even consider him?..

Edit : He can be rotated in and out based on the conditions. I meant he must be in the squad (11+Subs).",13
Finch wasn't even close to hitting that,4
"Finch looks absolutely terrible, he was dropped like 3 times before he finally got out against DC.",7
Kohli brought out his nets bat,3
"Finch is lucky for the ball tampering fiasco ...Failed as a test opener..If not leading his side would have been difficult to keep his place.

Remember the era where players like Hodge couldn't get into xi or the likes for m hussey had to wait for years to get a look in.

Bench strength of australia in tatters in last few years.",6
Curran trying for that magic ball,3
Why finch why? Why do you keep shitting on us.,13
"WTF is interesting over?

That was an excellent over, Mark!",2
Which franchise is Finch going to play for next year?,11
"Lol a little bit of inswing and Finch had no clue what's going on. If Australia didn't have flat roads and had some grass on the wicket, this guy wouldn't have half the average.",2
4D chess by Finch. Playing shit so India underestimates him when they tour Australia later this year,17
Philippe/moeen in for finch next game.,4
When was the last time Kohli performed against CSK?,8
Absolutely woeful batting from Finch. We were probably better off opening with Moeen Ali. Give him the same role as Narine for KKR. Just go and get as many runs in powerplay as possible..,6
2(9) by finchy ..not great for an overseas player,3
Drop finchy,1
"Finch is a waste of international spot. He never clicks in the I'll, mostly performs internationally.",3
Kohli should be Rcb's opener. He opened in the almost 1000 run season right?,6
I will take 2 extra defeats for a victory against csk,11
RCB is wasting a precious international slot on Finch. Please stop playing him from the second half of the league.,5
"Padikkal gets to double figures

Its our day bois",6
Lol elephant. Stop it Sunny.,3
[deleted],1
Lol Sunny G,3
"Hey hotstar, please add another commentary option for (sehwag +gambhir+nehra ji)",4
"Koach should open, he’s out there early anyway",7
Paddikal looks so comfortable.,2
"Finch is a great T20 player. He needs a long stint with a team, and he can be a real asset for them. Someone needs to persist with him. He just needs someone who wouldn't let go of him after one bad season

Unfortunately he's with RCB this year",3
"Finch should have gone in the 1st over, amazing swing bowling.
One in-swinger, and plays all over it.",3
Commentators roasting finch lmao,6
"Finch has been shit .

How high were Star executives when serial shitposter Nehra was convincing them to put him in the dugout,3
This pitch is a little better.,1
Finch's ass shook more than that wicket when he was bowled. Had to watch in slow motion.,3
No footwork at all smh,2
"Everyone dissing Nehra, he was speaking about the inswinger and bang goes Finch.",6
Time to up the run rate otherwise CSK might chase this down with a ball to spare.,9
"Finch. Disrespectful disgraceful shot. 

Not expected from an experienced International opening batsman.",6
"Aus fans need to explain form of Aus cricketers in IPL this season. Maxi, Smith, Finch look a shadow of themselves. And Stoinis at the other extreme end.",10
Finch looks like he's going Colin Ingram way rather than Jonny Bairstow way.,8
'unbatsmanlike' shot loool. Sunny G throwing some major shade there.,9
lol RCB gave up Stoinis and chose Finch,8
Woah Gavaskar shitposting really hard on the mic now,9
Had to switch from satellite to hotstar due to the rains and by God is hotstar's 25fps broadcast so garbage.,8
Finch really struggles against inswingers. Even Bhuvi troubles him a lot,3
I think finch is useless for rcb just slot in foreign all rounder and push kohli to opening.,7
"I am sorry , a leave?",2
They are laying into Finch!!,7
Unbatsmanlike. Gavaskar coming up with words that cause mobile keyboards to make multiple incorrect suggestions.,37
I am still thinking about the KXIP vs KKR match..😂,25
"Just want DDP to run out Kohli, and I’ll be throughly entertained.",11
"This is true for most teams but even more so for CSK: RCB can push CSK out of the game by constructing a really large score. Depending on the pitch, there's a cutoff score beyond which CSK cannot, and sometimes will not, chase.",9
RCB more cautious than required,3
Sunny G's rants are priceless.,10
"Unless Virat Kohli hits couple of cracking cover drives, he’ll be shaky and could lose his wicket any moment",7
RCB should replace Finch with Philippe. Give him 2-3 matches,18
"RCBs auction strategy was questionable they needed an opener and a wicketkeeper, they should've gone for Carey who opens in the Big Bash.",5
I would replace hazel wood with bravo not Curran bruh,5
Still can't believe KXIP lost!,12
"@mattymet , we need you today bruv",3
"OK.. Finch vs Chahar this match. 

7 balls, 0 runs, 5 times beaten ( Including the one where he was  bowled)",9
RCB should get Mooen and Parthiv for Finch and Gurkeerat,10
Wait this is CSK 7th match and I have seen Dhoni's 4th different look. lmao,21
[deleted],10
"Aww that's sweet. 
I went to Csk vs Mi I'm 2018 and saw MS sitting in the team bus. Absolutely lost control of my senses. Most Surreal moment of my life.",11
RCB don't have many batsmen in the reserves.,3
RCb pushing themselves into a corner here,5
Someone tell then this is supposed to be the easy part for the batsmen,8
Finch deserves all the criticisms for that ugly shot he played,21

lovely loud ‘wait’ call there by paddikal. big boy biz,3
Beautiful shot for a single; the crowd's going crazy!,6
"Koach is in good mood today, expect no less than a half century - optimistic RCB fan.",10
There seems to be more pressure playing in IPL than playing for your country lol,13
Koach needs to channel his 1st t20 vs WI 2019 form,5
"Rcb need to drop finch, really soon",11
Replace finch with Phillipe. He can keep and also open the innings,12
Dada hasnt aged a bit.,11
Ganguly with a fake beard,3
"Nehra - ""Sourav Ganguly enjoying some junk food"". BC, Nehra is a shitposter like us.",43
Can they use hand sanitizer instead of saliva to shine the ball?,5
Lol that was an ugly lowlights reel for Finch? Did someone put concrete in his boots?,11
Damn Chahar can swing the ball very nicely.,5
To survive this Chahar over should be the strategy.,3
Chahar was such shit in the previous match. RCB wasting here,-2
Kohli's strength is strike rotation. CSK needs to be on song in the field. Stop him from taking the 1s and 2s and you'll force him to do something extra.,8
Finch has the foot movement of a tailender,6
Koach cancelling the swing by having the advanced forward press. Meanwhile Finch trying to butcher the moving ball. How has he never made this adjustment is beyond me.,16
I prefer Kohli scoring big instead of AB against us. AB will ransack us if he gets going,16
"I swear when we let go of Finch next season, CSK will pick him up and he'll score 50+ runs almost every game..",108

Koach wants to take the match deep batting 1st,10
"""Elegant, like all left-handers are"". Obviously hasn't watched Rory Burns.",8
"Hotstar Push notification

*Dad's army vs to be dad's army*",8
Ball still swinging in the 5th over. What sorcery!!,2
Nehra telling everyone why he was not a successful bowling coach.,3
Jimmy Anderson in IPL when?,3
Why don't RCB try a pinch hitter at top like KKR used to with Narine? There's a lot of scope for the pinch hitters in T20 cricket I feel. Someone like Morris/Udana/Sundar could come at top and blaze away a few quick runs. RCB could try this as they're already weaker on the lower order.,3
RCB playing like KKR in the power play,2
Chahar has a chiseled face,3
So what did KL say in post match interview?,9
Finch cost the team 15 runs already.,8
This the OG meme matchup,5
I'm so over Finch. PP atleast will score freely in Powerplay,10
Getting my body ready for a kohli masterclass today,7
"If the fielders are gonna spit on the ground and possibly dive there, I don't understand the deal behind using spit to shine the ball.",6
How does a guy with 18 international 100s have such  shit foot work?,26
Thakur is here with a boundary.,2
"Wow Koach really trying to follow Dhoni to a T, huh?",2
Really want to switch from Dugout to normal commentary but if I hear that Cred ad one more time I might just shoot myself ...at least with Dugout there are less ads,8
RCB should just start wearing their green jersey every match. Red clearly isn't working for them,3
Thakur will be back to form today I can feel it,1
Lord Thakur is here bitch,5
"Except for Buttler, only Indian openers have succeeded this IPL",-3
"Is CSK in the mood of - hum to dubenge, tumko bhi le dubenge...",2
I've made Thakur my captain... I am most afraid of him...,10
DDP😍,1
Jadeja lmao,5
That couldve been out,1
Padikkal in double digit. Not less than 50 then.,5
"Ok hear me out 

Ummm who will win a semi final between South Africa and Kings eleven Punjab?",17
Excellent field placing from MS there,3
Shardul such a hottie. ❤❤❤😍😍😱😱😱😉😉🔥🔥🔥,-6
There's a slip and then a fielder on a thirty yard and then a third man?,3
What’s DDP’s height,2
I guess they really should get Parthiv now. Atleast he would score in the Powerplay. Plus he can keep and we would get to see AB taking those amazing catches in the outfield.,3
Lmao Jadeja,2
"There are a few players whom you just don't like to watch, thakur gives me that vibe",4
Dumb question but Does Kohli has a weakness?,6
Shardul is so hit or miss. He could get Kohli or Padikkal out or he could get carted for 20+ in his over.,11
"CSK batting lineup and bowling lineup are complete contrasts.

Bowling: Heavily reliant on young, promising bowlers with a couple of veterans to bring the experience.

Batting: No youngsters at all. Hopefully this Jagadeesan dude delivers.",6
"I could see 3 wickets, an elephant and the leg where the ball hit but Shardul thinks otherwise",3
Shot boi.,1
Beauty from Kohli,1
Thank you thakur. Very cool,2
Commentators shitting their pants having to choose between Thala and Koach.,35
Simply hate thakur because he wore the number 10 jersey for the national team after the goat retired. And i’m not the only one.,-1
Make Parthiv or Sundar open already. Bring in Moeen.,6
It is always a delight to see Kohli play,6
"CSK won't panic if the target is around 160. That target suits their style. If Koach or AB doesn't go bonkers today, they'll be right where CSK wants them to be.",9
"Did joe root sit out of auction ??

Considering so many teams are shitting in middle order , he could have been a good buy...can give few overs of off spin as well.",9
Strange looking Kohli shot. 4 nonetheless.,-2
Thakur back to usual self after last match performance,4
Why do we take 6 matches to realize that PP is actually a valuable addition to the team.,9
"Padikkal is so much more exciting to watch than Gill and Rahul, I might be biased because I love southpaws tho",6
"Friendship ended with jadhav, thakur is our new friend.",15
"Wtf is Vintage Kohli, my man is 31",95
"For a captain who loves to chop and change, surprised how VK hasn't dropped Finch already",19
What’s a par score here?,2
What's up with teams not making as much runs in the powerplay as before ?,3
Thakur giving more than 10 runs in his first over. Even 2020 can't change some things.,1
Thicckur inherited number 10 from Thiccdulkar,6

How many more chances for Finch?,1
CSK fans... Do you guys have hope?,-3
Slow ball spamming,3
a respectable 6 rpo,1
Altroz: The car no one gives a flying fuck about,8
I hate that This Aaron Finch always gets special treatment in IPL. Moeen Ali gets dropped after one failure while Finch doesn't. Finch always gets crores with multiple bids from teams despite being an IPL flop for 10 years. While Alex Hales and Evin Lewis can't get a single bid. Same thing happens with Maxwell.,14
"Hyd chichas, who are you rooting for?",3
Am I the only who is veryy happy beacuse ben is playing tmrw???,3
Koach looks like a man on a mission.,2
guys any news on mid season transfers?,1
"I hate to admit, but pp would have scored more runs than finchy in all these matches",11
Bravo might take the wicket of Kholi. Idk just a feeling.,6
"Forget us for a moment, how shit is Punjab?",113
"DDP and Shaw are good players but Gill is different class. His temperament is world class and has all the shots in the book, his technique is supreme too. He may be the next legend of Indian cricket.",5
"CSK doesn't have inconsistent batting lmao. CSK just aren't batting. They just be vibing in the middle, which is the issue",1
Great ODI powerplay batting by our boys,7
How many wides has Bravo bowled this season!,7
Csk is definitely rcbs Achilles heel. Rcb always choke against csk almost everytime and I don't remember any good rcb performance against csk,11
"I never thought I could be violated by a car, but here I am. Constantly getting the Altroz shoved down my throat every hour.",12

So jadhav was made a scape goat and dhoni escapes?,14
Is Curran a member of the Kaul Headband tribe,13
Fucking hell. Kohli is a beauty to watch. I can never get enough of that cover drive.,19
Me hard,4
sanjay bangar trying hard to sound enthusiastic but it just doesn’t work,9
That shot was perfect 😍,6
Bravo doesn't look the same eccentric fella this year,14
Jagadeesan looks like a bear,2
The way Bangar described the shot one'd think Kohli completed a century.,11
"Nah Sunny, he didn't take his time.",2
Koach is back guys. Thank you bhumrah.,12
It wouldn’t have been out even if it hit the wickets.,2
Kohli in form today bois,2
Jagadeesan for the opening? But I feel the chemistry between him and Watto will be weird.,5
Wasn't DDP a WWE guy? You remember that storyline when he stalked Undertaker's wife,3
Never seen watson run on the field lol that was funny,0
"Honestly, after that suicidal, shit-show of an innings from Finch, we've actually done decently well to come back. Just hope Kohli and Paddikal stay another 8-10 overs..",0
"STFU gavaskar, Jagadeesan wasn’t slow",6
That cover drive makes me seriously like him as a bloke,8
Watson lol,7
Watson in boundary?,5
Watsons age is quite visible when he's running.,8
Somebody tell Gavaskar you also need to hit the wickets for a run out,19
Watto sliding to save a boundary? I've seen everything in 2020,38

why is watson in the deep LMAO,8
"Is there any Bangaladesh player in IPL?

There is an imposter in dugout,0
"Padikkal should really get going. He only has 1 shot to escape strike, and it is the dab to third man. Must try to diversify his shot selection slightly.",0
Kohli putting pressure on ~~fielder~~ ~~bowler~~ ~~captain~~ non striker with that mad running.,82
At this rate TATA would launch the vehicle in the UK just for Swann.,73
"Padikkal is playing rather slowly, like Jaiswal the other day.",2
Missing my man Jadhav already. /s,0
"Wait what position will CSK get to if they win?

Lol it doesn’t matter, they are not winning shit.",-19
MS Dhoni must have made 50cr+ this IPL,-9
Am happy chahar back in form :),9
Watson despite being 39 is a good runner between wickets.,6
165 can be a good score I guess. But you never be sure with RCB's bowling.,5
"Why is Chris Morris so down the batting order ,atleast in the team layout at the beginning?",1
Simon Katich looks like a gullible dad who Kohli easily can take advantage of,2
Idk why but I feel like we'll see a Jaddu special runout today.,7
[deleted],15
Dhoni didn't even smile for Finch's wicket wtf. That must be quite demoralizing for a bowler no?,3
Hahah.. Watto was churning those legs but going nowhere. He was never the fastest. But father time has made him look even slower.,3

Probably for the first time ever!",7

"Most underrated spinner , Karn Sharma",2
Insane how RCB keep rotating their fourth overseas player but Finch plays every game,7
The thing i like about koach is he is not doing those stupid fantasy betting ads.,1
Isn't this batting Paradise?,1
Do you guys think these timeouts actually affect the mojo of the teams and that they suffer as soon as they come back? I've seen too many set players get out just after the timeouts,1
karn sharma’s action looks like someone pressed fast forward midway through it.,17
"It's depressing seeing Tahir, Hazelwood and Ngidi on the sidelines getting drinks",14
"I think the main difference between how all these Indian youngsters and new comers perform is how confident and ""at home"" they feel. Jaiswal is a brilliant player but I just feel like he felt out of place to suddenly find himself among such big names whereas Padikkal has literally carried the team at times when the big names failed. The team management must make a difference as well.",12
"Padikkal lets not play ODI pls, KL just did that n fcked up",15
Okay what is he doing now,2
RCB has evaded the humiliation of 49 all out one more time,15
"youngsters and dot balls,best duo this IPL.",10
Padi is a good batsman but eating up too many dots for my liking,3
No way RCB is dropping Finch.,5
why is paddi playing slow,4

"Looking at RCB batting line-up, when do you think one of these batsmen should make a move on?",3
I don't understand why the one match they can BatDeep they're going tuk tuk,1
Why is RCB doin a CSK here.?. But atleast they are getting those 1's and 2's.,3
Someone wake RCB and tell them what happened to KXIP.. get a move on..,3
CSK take finch and give us hazelwood.,7
Padikkal needs to start his engines now.,4
If you play 25 balls in a T20 with 10 overs left your final score should not score under 60.,-3

I only want to say “Ghanta” to that!",2

"This is shaping up to be the kind of innings which makes you lose the match single-handedly. Padikkal bro, what are you doing?",9
"very respectable 6 rpo in the first powerplay, save wickets and start hitting in the 35th over",6
"Is it the pitch, or its conservative batting?",6

Looooong looooong maaaannn,2
I can sense a Thala chase today to return to form. He always does it vs RCB.,4
That one dude enjoying pizza in one advert and getting chicks number in another is living his life,6
Thala koach better get going too,-2
Graeme Swann is an absolute treat in the dugout.,2
"RCB - We bat chill as we don't have a target 


CSK - We bat chill as we don't care for the target",22
Does any one else find playing of music after each boundary cringe?,2
Looks like they're finally a c c e l e r a t I n g,3
"I hate these kind of too slow openers in t20. They are good for a 50 over match but in a t20 they put the whole team on the back foot, especially if there is no in form  attacking players at the other end to compensate. Up your strike rate or get out, this is t20.",7
See this is why I'll never fault Finch for playing an ugly shot and getting out. Nobody wants to see an ODI partnership in a T20 match.,6
"They say the score at 11th over is doubled to get the approximate final score. 

If RCB finished 11th over at 70~80 they will score 140-160 

Good score ?",1
Whatsa par score here,1
Didn't know DDP was a thing,2
Really good to see someone using his feet against spinners.,1
Why does everyone wants Sam Curran to be dropped?,2
Please stop calling him by initials he is not abd,2
We have Sadhu Kokila in the crowd wearing red 😎,2
Mallus : Sanju :: Bongs : Sourav,0
Where is thakur when we need him,1
"Thank god I support DC in IPL, helps to cope up as a Manchester United fan. Feel for KXIP tho",2
FrOm tHe cOmFoRt oF tHeIr HoMeS,1
Need a Virat masterclass today,1
6.5 rpo with 9 wickets in have is Fucking abysmal,2
The audience guy is sleeping during the six. And then he wakes up makes audience excited for a single!!,7
Someone tell Kohli he's going to lose this game if he doesn't get another 120-130 in the next 10 overs,6
"Aussies here, who do you think Finch will be replaced by in your team?",2
That scared me smh,5
Lord Thakur almost struck,3
We have normalised DDP like nothing ever happened,2
"RCB need to hit out, they bat super deep today.",2
Dont care who wins but it's important that Kohli get some old form back.,8
Morris needs to bat 5 today,2
This match is interesting because one team is not good at chasing the other is not good at defending,5
"Hope Virat can get his 50 fast, his acceleration after 50 is next level.",6
Rcb can't defend anything less than 180 let's accept it. These guys need to slog and they better do it fast,5
Koach playing in the air so early? DDP is getting to him,2
"Guys this is test match, upvotes to the left",13
Faf you sre just too good a fielder man.,1
Kohli wanted to show some intent,1
About time he was struggling way too much today,3
Bad innings by Paddy,5
Padikkal noooooo :(,3
Koach's catches get dropped too often by Indian players for it to be a coincidence,-3
Anchor (TM) out,2
Lord thakur,4
lmao my dad actually fell asleep during this game,3
Horrible innings from Padi.,6
"65 for none in 10  is a great start for RCB. 


Kohli is looking to play full 30-35 overs, century incoming.",3
[deleted],-2
33(33) what a beautiful innings.,5
They should look to bat till stumps day 1. And try to get to a decent score on second day before declaring.,1
"Nobody:

r/Cricket member: <player's name> has bigger boobs than my GF",7
Both KKR and RCB playing it like an ODI lmao,5
😭,2
Welp. it's ABD,4
Fuck... We lose when padikkal doesn't score a fifty,4
"Fuck all, ma boy Thakur does it again.",2
Pitch is definitely slow,7
The pitches are dying,7
Half of csk wickets in this season are courtesy - faf,8
PaddiKL,5
Oh no no no no.,2
Bold call. But I'll say Shardul picks a wicket here off a mediocre ball.,3
Lord strikes,2
"Nooooo, now ABD will come",7
Not good for CSK,3
Shardul Thakur T20 CWC Squad when?,3
Padikkal playing a Jaiswal like innings sadly,3
RCB too slow,1
Witc RCB bowlers atleast 180 should be scored on 150 pitch.,5
"**10.2** Thakur to Padikkal, OUT, **taken at mid-off.** **66-2**

D Padikkal c du Plessis b Thakur 33 (34b 2x4 1x6) SR: 97.05",4
Faf sexi,3
paddikal you himbo,4
One of the worst individual innings of this season.,4
Right time to get out!!,3
https://media1.tenor.com/images/5198aac8f04c105379617199e0b9665b/tenor.gif,1
I have new found respect for players who go all guns ball 1.,6
"How come Shardul is always producing a breakthrough? Great improvement tbh, in the death especially!!",5
"When Jaiswal did it, everyone was on his case. Now Koach and Paddikal are doing it, and its all well calculated..",7
There he goes.,1
All RCBians please sign a petition to have Ab bat at 3 from now on.,7
This looks like a 100-run Faf-Watson partnership kind of game.,2
Is Faf the only fielder in CSK at the boundary?,8
"I think the commentators have a point

The bowlers are starting to find their rhythm and the pitches are starting to slow down a bit as well. Could lead to lower scores for the second half of the tournament which will suit teams like CSK",6
"RCB can’t defend 200 and CSK can’t chase 160, a match made in heaven.",12
isuru better come good today,1
How good is this karn sharma guy?,2
Abd about to play a Dinesh karthik like innings,2
"Padikkal out without a 50, RCB gonna lose this one.",4
This was a very selfish and disappointing innings from paddikal,4
Devdasvi Paddikwal called it,1
fabulous fabulous faffy,2
"When playing the anchor role doesn't pan out later on, you look like a selfish idiot.",2
Oh god Kohli is gonna play more tuk tuk now,3
Ugh Thakur shag me,4
Op! Shit. No Padikkal show today. AB boys!,6
"This is where I will take Pant quickfire innings over this. High risk, high reward.",4
Has Faf ever dropped a catch?,5
RCB is playing slowly out of respect for seniors.,6
Thank god paddikal out too slow,3
[deleted],21
Ddp just wanted to have 50 partnership with his idol.,7
"Let me state this-
I like Padikkal, technically sound and good temperament. But, he ain't no Yuvi. Yuvi at this age was smashing bowlers like there is no tomorrow. So plz stop comparing him with Yuvi. Padikkal needs to be groomed and he can be a great future Indian team prospect.",11
Not sure this is good for CSK. Jaiswal gone Tewatia to come in lol :p,3
India clearly has all openers and no middle order batsman.,6
"DDP caught by FDP. 

Are you sure we talking cricket and not some computer networks topic?",6
RCB really won't mind this wicket. Need to break the next partnership ASAP. Don't wanna chase180+ after a Devilliers Onslaught.,3
"Todays batting lineup looks weak. If they can tame ABD, not much to come after that.",1
Yeah now we are fucked,3
RCB really should get someone like Kane Williamson. Put him at 4. Open with Koach. AB at 3. Top 3 play their own game with some confidence in the middle order.,6
DJ is stuck in the 90s. Not that I mind it.,2
[deleted],4
Now they will crumble trying to bring up the run rate,1
Man I miss Gayle and chinnaswami.. what a combo it was..,5
Csk just two wickets away from an easy win.,4
"If ABD had a dollar for everytime he needed to hyperaccelerate the RCB scoring rate, he'd make more money than his whatever his IPL salary is lol",14
Is support staff expected to scream ABD?,3
Thakur has become such a good bowler wtf?,3
Damn Faf looking hot with that new beard.,2
Should have sent a free wicket here like Udana or Morris.,3
"As a casual fan of CSK I am very pleased at the low scoring rate and the fact that this wicket doesn't look too easy to bat on. However. As a casual CSK fan, I am very worried at the current low scoring rate and the fact that the wicket doesn't look very easy to bat on",9
Nice,1
[deleted],2
"Morris is hot and cold with the bat, but when he gets hot he does a 82(32)",1
ABD gone!,2
NOoooooooo :(,3
"Don't worry about the run-rate RCB fans, we're going to make it a 12 RRR scenario by over 15 regardless of target.",4
"Paddikal gets out with a S/R of 97.1 - Oh dear! Oh dear! Gorgeous

Jaiswal gets out with a S/R of 94.4 - You fucking Donkey.",5
hahahahahahaha Thakur taketh....,2
Nehra and Jatin comparing faf to rdj,2
Wow,2
LETS GOOO CHOKLI PUT PRESSURE ON ADB TOO,2
and we're on to the tail.,2
Lord Thakur for the T20 WC!!!!,2
Thakur with a *bouncer*,3
What a ball!,2
Lord Thakur is on fire,7
"Fuck yeah, this is awesome.",5
"Haha, Thakur u beauty 👌👌👌",3
OMG Bois we're in.,4
AAR CEE BEE,3
Lord Thakur.,4
"Whewwwww, that's gotta hurt RCB today.",7
"Thakur is the new GOAT, hands down",8
Nehra and Jatin comparing faf to rdj,3
Thakur my Boi,7
Tupac Thakur strikes!,9
Didn't imagined in this universe Lord Thakur will get ABD for 0..,18
Wow,2
GOTHIMMMMMMMMM,3
Holy shit! Are we sure that the bowler is Lord Thakur and not an imposter??,9
Lord Thakur can do no wrong this year,6
Why is deVilliers wearing yoga pants,4
Time to do something else boiz. See you in next one. CSK have some points today,12
Goodnight everyone 👋,5
This familiar feeling...,7
Lord strikes,3
Shardul fuckin Thakur lmao,5
Behenchod,2
Kohllapse™ ,3
"I dont understand, how shardul comes to get some good wickets :/",5
Rip,1
Shaping up to be a disaster for RCB,5
This is worrying....,2
Not used to de Villiers going so early without any impact....,14
Thakur. I love you. 😍,6
Lord Thakur,1
Lord Thakur!,2
Thakur God,3
No no no no no no no no,6
Shardul has been really good,4
"**10.5** Thakur to de Villiers, OUT, **there's a sound and there's a wicket!** AB de Villiers for a duck. **67-3**

AB de Villiers c &dagger;Dhoni b Thakur 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",0
"Wow, that was unexpected!",1
Faf looks like a detective from a black and white french movie UwU,3
SHARDUL FUCKIN THAKUR GET INNNNN,5
Omg Thakur 💦💦💦😍😍😍🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆,5
Lollllll,1
"And that's the game. Well played bois, see you next match",4
Aahhhhhh!!!!,2
Fuck it how does Thakur does it again & again for CSK.,8
now’s a great time to join the match thread! CSK!!,6
I just wanted to watch some good cricket but kxip lost by 2 centimetres and ABD got out on his second ball. what a day man,5
Lord thakur we bow down to you!,3
"OH THAKUR YOU ABSOLUTE BEAUTY, FUCKING LOVE YOU SO MUCH!",3
Lord Thakur,2
Folks don't be surprised. Thakur has been doing this the last 2 matches as well. He takes wickets but also goes for expensive overs.,5
Oh no,1
RIP. Only a Koach century with some fireworks from Morris can save us,1
ABD at 0. Peak 2020.,8
ABD's form should give Kohli some sleepless nights. Not looking too good for RCB,6
Thakur being in prime form is the only positive thing in 2020,7
Imagine getting out to Lord,3
Oopsy doopsy,2
Do you want Padikkal back now? lol,8
Faf with RDJ look,3
"Shardul"" Dale Glenn Wasim"" Thakur",18
They need to show that they wont crumble now,1
"*my stream is much behind*

Boundary after so many balls , FK boundary not even a double....",4
Alexa play noorondu nenapu. 😒,9
"No worries, don’t need too many for CSK. Get to 160 somehow.",-1
Can both of these teams lose? Such unlikeable teams,-3
"Well, pack it up boys. RCB and CSK have returned.",2
Do RCB fans consider ABD overrated in IPL?,-8
"Ok guys, it was fun, next match namdee",24
Pain,7
RCB middle order is gonna go through a litmus test now then.,12
we done boys,7
[deleted],17
welp we're gonna be behind kkr now,8
I don't remember Thakur being this good for the Indian team,7
People blaming DDP for playing slow,3
"Aight imma head out

Good night to everyone except CSK",15
Things just feel more right with RCB messing things up again. At least something's still normal in 2020.,1
Wtf what a boring day of cricket,1
At least we have the 5th overseas player in Sundar from Washington,5
Already the tail?,3
RCB's tail has begun,3
Yeah washi go champ,3
Lord Thakur actually is our strike bowler,3
"Idk man, we shit the chase so I am not gonna say anything",9
Ok.. I thought Shardul was going to pick a wicket. I didn't see him picking two wickets. And that ABD one was a really good delivery. Just went straight on.,2
LETS GOOO,1
"Score 120 runs, remove Shane Watson and Faf. Game over for CSK.",1
"Now that both Padikkal and AB have both gone, please someone else actually contribute along with Kohli and not just give him a stand. Let's get some semblance of a consistent middle order, instead of always relying on the top 4.",2
"Soft hands and ABD? Never. 

Always a forceful shot. Fails like this in the beginning of an innings sometimes.

Needs to be more watchful because of the price of his wicket.",5
Wait. RCB doesn't have a middle order? No offense to Sundar/Dube but they are not exactly strong batsmen.,3
Is the nickname DDP catching on?,4
Why sundar?,5
Why the fuck is Washington sunder your number 5 ?,2
Roz Chutiyapa Bhaiyo = RCB,5
Why do bowlers turn to shit when they play for RCB and turn into gold when playing for CSK 😭,5
Uhhh this doesnt look good,7
"As I said, Thakur is so hit or miss. He can get big players in his over or he can go for a big amount in his over.",9
"If RCB manage to win from here, surely it would be something else?",2
That was a beautiful leg cutter. Venky Prasad level good.,2
Padikkals made a huge difference to RCB team by scoring consistently this year.. whenever he doesn't score team seems to struggle and end up losing the match as well,8
"Man, feel like Washington Sundar is gonna play an innings of his lifetime today",8
RCB should keep in mind that neither Vijay nor Jadhav is there to save them today.  They can't be too overconfident just because it's CSK.,11
I think Dube should play ahead of Sundar,3
this ipl is going to be good if rcb win from here.,1
Kohli will have to re-calibrate the optimal target on the fly. Can't be fixated on a specific score.,1
We need Thakur at RCB. Two desi Ladyboners Dube + Thakur 😍😍😍,4
"So then, Kohli masterclass for today?",4
AB De Villiers may be okay but he is no match for ATGs like Lord Thakur.,5
How to check ABd stats vs CSK?,1
"RCB finish on 120, CSK 80 for 6 after 18. I’ve seen this movie before",13
Karn Sharma’s action reminds me of a balloon wala. Walks up sweetly and meekly to you and then pulls out a balloon and rapidly fashions it into a dachshund,3
Reminds me of a time when I bunked office in South Africa to watch ABD in Mzansi T20 only for ABD to get out for a golden duck! He tried reverse sweep the every first ball!,4
Its raining in Bangalore and RCB wickets in today's match.,3
Atleast with kxip there's hope until they choke. With rcb we start with none and end with none,12
"Me: Mom can we meet RDJ.      

Mom: We have RDJ at home.     

RDJ at Home: Faf",10
Only watching because Kohli.,2
"Genuine outside edge on a driving length, forced by Shardul Thakur

Wtf mate",3
"Thala got the memo last match , shaved everything.",11
Thakur is so underrated!!,5
Surely open with Parthiv and Paddikkal next game??,2
What the fuck is going on,3
"Ootl, whats happening?",3
Was hyped to finally watch gurkeerat bat and out comes sundar,4
"RCB Supporters right now:

Ye haath mujhe de de Thakur!",11
Seems like RCB made a deal with the devil. ABD to be in poor form as long as RCB isn't the meme team anymore,5
First time this IPL seeing MSD smile,3
Thakur is actually having an excellent season so far. Damn.,6
Washington to make 100 runs today,3
Why Sundar now ?,2
Can washi do a Tewatia,2
"I just tuned in, is Dhoni following the DK way to lose hair in order to win matches?",3
How bad is it when I lose hope even with VK at the crease? I think it's the CWC effect.,13
what is so right with Thakur this season man!,3
"Padikkal is highest score right now.

This pitch looks like it's hard to bat on for some reason. Smith said similar yesterday that ball stopping in the surface.",2
gurkeerat gonna break the record for most games without batting or bowling,6
Something ain't right,3
"Just when they were about to accelerate. Need to rebuild again, and dhoni smartly brings in jadeja to get  few quiet overs in",4
"**Shardul Thakur's wicketd this season**

Vs KXIP: KL Rahul, Pooran

Vs SRH: Manish Pandey

Vs KKR: Gill, Russell

**Vs RCB : Devdutt, De Villiers**",7
Just need Koach's wicket now.,2
[deleted],8
Nehra ji shitting hard on RCB for sending out Sundar.,3
"The only way Indian batsmen will fulfill their potential is if they're allowed to gain experience and fail. No one bursts onto the international or national scene and just scores 100s every single game. 

But unfortunately, people look at what Dhoni and Kohli are capable of now and forget that they weren't like this when they first played high level cricket. 

Ridiculous expectations does no one favours. It also means naturally aggressive gifted hitters like Pant end up losing their ability to play that way because they're criticised every time they get out trying to attack.",3
"guys does anyone plays ipl on cricket 19?

if yes then team matches or all the matches",1
Age is catching up with ABD. We have to accept that we can’t expect the good ole’ 360 hitting from ABD anymore.,-2
Holy moly what was that defense?,2
What an absolute beauty from S Thakur. Even the great AB had no answer. CSK clearly in control here.,-1
Faf du Plessis looks like Tony Stark: Ashish Nehra,5
Slip in for Koach. Seriously? Don't trigger Kohli plss,2
"This is ABD's 7 th IPL duck , going past Kohli (6) in the list of most ducks for RCB. 
Credit: twitter",4
Remember it took Chennai 17.4 overs to chase 70 down against RCB last year. Don't lose hope RCBians.,7
Faf and jatin sapru will now look similar thanks to Faf's new style.,1
"Everyone saying RCB batting over reliant on Kohli and ABD but dude, you do realize Finch was bought for that damn reason. If he has sucked ass, then time to perhaps change strategy? Everytime Finch gets out early pressure on RCB, which they can defo do without",3
Slow tracks are CSK's forte. Let's see what they can do today!!!,4
"Suddenly CSK in form against RCB, lmao.",2
"Transfer of Meme Team Trophy 🏆 back from KXIP ➡️ RCB 

Loading.... 🔄",9
smh.. should stop being invested in ip,4
Just watch Dube cunt it,3
So RCB doesn't have a decent batsman after no4? Sundar doesn't look like a reliable no5.,3
"Let me guess, we'll barely put on a score of 140-150 and CSK will chase it down with 10 wickets to spare..",6
i'll be happy to see 150 on board,6
"Think RCB are bit too overconfident about our batting 

I mean we are shit but think 120 is within our range.",9
KOACH AND THALA made an agreement to play no shots,5
"Dhoni always brings on his A-game vs RCB. 

Spot on with the captaincy so far.",4
That defend tho 11.4,2
That's very good delivery from Thakur,1
5.75 is a shit run rate.,3
"Rcb playing to prove that they r the actual meme driven team

Who tf is kxip?",3
Will Kohli score a century today ?,1
Kohli warming up for the tests later this year,3
Let's hope RCB can get to 150,3
"CSK has to win today to shut up all the toxic fans, after Chennai’s last game, some of the especially toxic ones were making RAPE THREATS TO DHONI’S 5 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER",4
Sundar has clearly decided to Jadhav or Tewatia here. Which one is it?!,1
Anything below 150 & it's game on for us.,3
This IPL is fucking booring if we remove a couple matches,4
What is this batting by RCB? Are they playing a 50 over game?,8
"Honestly Idk what people are whining about. Back in my time, 250 in 50 overs was considered a high total. With that perspective RCB is doing quite well.",9
Why are people excited for Morris? Hasn;t he been garbage in the past in IPL?,2
How many more matches does csk have to win to qualify?,1
IPL is cool because as an India fan you don't really lose all that often. IPL teaches me how to deal with pain.,3
"Predict the final score , my prediction 150",2
"Is jatin sapru in the broadcasting scene because of his voice? It's amazing,idk about his analysis and stuff, I think they mostly memorise what's to be told.",1
"If dhoni comes in today, it becomes interesting.",1
Kohlis too afraid of a collapse,4
RCB need to get 151. That's Laxman Rekha for CSK,5
what is rcb's strategy here?? genuinely curious why they've been going at 6 runs an over since the first over?,5
This is very good ODI batting,3
"Fuck it, kohli lofting bowlers down the ground is the sexiest cricket shot i’ve ever seen",2
"Holy fucking hell, RCB really doesn't have any middle or low order at all!!!


Like their paid all money to Koach and AB, and then got next 5 bats in a garage sale!!!",2
"Thakur is doing well this ipl on these wickets because he’s bowling 90% of his deliveries as cross seamers. he LITERALLY doesn’t know what the ball will do after pitching and by extension what he’s doing, only explanation for the sudden uptake in wickets and impact.",1
CSK in Red vs CSK in Yellow,4
RCB will do well to cross 150 from here.,1
Bowling leg spinner to left handed batsman was a bad idea?,2
Shundor.,1
People keep bashing CSK for not giving youngsters chances then get triggered when Lord Thakur performs,5
IPL sucks,1
"Sundar is a good batsman himself, so why play Gurkeerat lol",1
That's why George is sent,1
rr less than 6.,1
Lol at those poll results,1
[deleted],1
"Kohli:Plays run a ball





r/cricket : No this isn't how you are supposed to play the game",4
Leg spinner to a left handed batsman is a bad idea.,3
Washi whatta shot,2
"I see the issue here. Dhoni shaved off the beard, what a sacrifice for a CSK comeback",4
Dhoni winning all captaincy polls since time immemorial,6
"I wouldn't trust our bowlers with 180+, even against this CSK... And here we are going at less than a run a ball...",2
Kohli is done as a top level batsman,-6
"RCB have invented a new format! Test match of  20 overs.
Thanks RCB",1
Sundar shot!,2
Great intent from Sundar!,3
Has the recent runs thing bugged out on this post? I can't see the latest runs,1
"With Dhoni's backing, Shardul has been transformed into a middle-overs Deepak Chahar.",2
Kohli's actually got a lot more white in his beard than I remember. Dude has had a lot of stress on him for the past couple years.,4
Sundar can bat and anyone who’s has watched Tnpl knows how good a batsman he is,4
"What's with Australian players in this IPL. Except Warner, none of them seem to score any runs this IPL.",3
Sundar shot,3
"Dhoni to jaddu ""Tu sambhal,
Ye mera headache nhi he""",5
Let’s watch people other than ABD and VK contribute to RCB for once,3
"RCB should atleast get 138... 

Double your score after 12 overs",2
I hope we cross 100 this innings... We've already lost by the highest margin chasing... Don't want to lose big defending as well,3
"Ok.. Earlier I had said KXIP might have the worst batting lineup in IPL. And I'm glad I used ""might"", because RCB has to be right up there. At Least with KXIP, I said that because Maxi is horribly out of form. With RCB they just have bowling all rounders coming in after 3 wickets down.",1
"That's the most entertaining shot this evening, cmon rcb",3
[deleted],6
I find it hilarious when the bowler and players give their heart and soul to an appeal almost making you believe that it’s really plumb but when the umpire refuses to give you the decision and it’s up to you to use a referral they are like “naaaah it’s obvious that it’s not out”,5
Virat Kohli probably has the #5 spot in t20i for sundar in his mind,8
People saying Dhoni more important than kohli is peak meme in IPL,-1
Batting looks tough. Csk are not chasing this.,0
Sundar shit,-1
Ati Sundar,3
Koach I want a century,2
"Hahahaha, Chahal had to bolt.",4
RCB about 20 runs short at this stage imo. If they dont smash it at the death they're fucked,2
Imagine if they had Moeen yet to come in their batting lineup,0
Rcb's tail begins at no 5 . Interesting,4
"In between, Dhoni now holds the record of taking most catches among keepers in IPL, going past Dinesh Karthik’s tally of 104 catches.",6
"Yuzi running away from Sundar's six. 

Can't blame the guy. Only recently married to a pretty girl /s",4
"My dad said ""Dube seems like he's always sleepy""

I guess he's got a point",3
"Maybe this batting performance from Rcb might not be awful,it’s just this pitch it looks like it’s stopping a lot and getting slower,so if Rcb are able to land it in the right areas and not give away free runs they can win",7
Did dhoni just have an orgasm?,4
"Sundar tryna make it ugly for csk

Translation: A beauty tryna make it ugly for csk",4
What was that appeal lol.,5
jadeja shouting like a little girl lmao,1
Can't wait for jaddu to not celebrate Kohli's wicket,5
And they'll put csk on top of the fair play list.,-1
"""If it's in the arc, it's out of the park"".....the first time one of Sunny's rhymes haven't been max cringe imo.",4
Why appeal if you’re not going to review,-3
Fu*king hit Kohli,0
"Rcb seems to have missed team updates on toss

No jadhav for today",0
Jadeja appeal 10/10,0
Dhoni Stump Mic masterclass,6
Why not try sundar as an opener since he opens for Tamil Nadu anyway? Take out finch for moeen,8
Will deepak chahar be big thing for India in future?,3
Aaram se lol,2
Sundar bats as an opener in TNPL and RCB could actually do with him at the top with Padikkal at some point. and then maybe play Moeen for Finch.,1
Ok Jadeja just lost his test position.,3

Typical CSK game tbh. Bowls well until 16th over then concede a 20-30 run over which will take the opposition to 160-170. Then our batting order will lose the match by the 10th over and still only be around 10 runs less than the target.,4

"Looking at the CSK squad (and even this XI), it seems they have one too many players for a particular role. Faf, Watto, Gaikwad, Jagadeesan, Rayudu, Vijay all fit into the top order role. Jadeja, Bravo, Curran, Santner are all similar in that holding bowler-all rounder role. Chawla, Tahir, Sharma are all leggies. Thakur and Chahar, although their skills are not exactly similar, thrive in similar conditions. 

No good, big-hitting finishers and the fast bowlers who can add some bite to the attack (even more necessary, given lack of power batting options) can't get in the XI thanks to lack of squad balance.

15 out 22 squad members cover only three distinct roles.
CSK would be better off building a squad with more balanced options.",11
Good fucking shot that is,10
Fucking amazing that pull.... Orgasmic,8
39 ball 50. That's actually not bad.,29
Kohli is so funny!!,1
RCB can have the strong middle order if only they get Parthiv for Gurkeerat as opener and give him the license to attack in powerplay and Moeen for Finch in middle order. Moeen literally has the highest strike rate of all players in middle overs since his debut in 2018 IPL. He destroys spinners. They can play attacking cricket as They bat till no. 9 with Morris and Udana in the lower order.,9

"**Most catches taken for a team in T20 cricket**

**106 - MS Dhoni for CSK**

105 - Steven Croft for Lancashire

103 - Suresh Raina for CSK

98 - Kieron Pollard for MI

85 - Virat Kohli for RCB",12
There it is,4
Don't worry Sam you'll get Koach in England,6
Wow he is gonna fuck us now,8
"Damn, that shot.",3
"Anushka Bhabheeeee.....,.",8
Live seeing Curran getting belted.,1
Sunny ji commentating and camera pans to Anushka,7
Why the fuck is Curran bowling when you've 2 overs from Bravo???,0
"Yes, Koach. 6.

Ab bas pel de.",7
"Lol that's the least happy RCB fan I've ever watched.
Girl looks like she's being forced to wave that flag",9
"Welp, we ded.",8
Feels so good to see Kohli smash it out of the park. Either for RCB or india,9
Shot by Kohli.,3
I don't know what others feel but Virat Kohli is definitely the greatest batman I've ever seen.,8
The team which brings koach into form should be fined,5
How many Ajinkya Rahane look-a-likes  are playing in this IPL,2
"I will not hesitate to suck Kohli off

Anytime anyday",10
"Mate,I feel for Mann,won't get to bat or bowl,only there to field. 😂

Just like the youngest kid in gully cricket team.",9
How's it looking for csk? I heard kolhi hit another 6. Can he really dismantle CSK's chances?,3
Sam ThaCur,4
Curran is not a good death bowler. This is criminal to bowl him to a set Kohli,10
Why would you keep a wk batsman at long on?,2
14 off first three delieveries,0
Nice to see Kohli hit well while batting first,4
Csk back to our shitty depth bowling,4
Come on boys 🙏🏽,1
Viral kilo about to accelerate that strike rate like he didn't bat almost run a ball for 3 quarters of the match,3
Can koach get a century here,5
"To quote JL:



*He is gonna do it again, isn't he*",3
Anujksa is so lucky I swear,1
Curran losing the plot,2
"Whatsapp advertising, Navika- NO",1
And just like that virat is at 12th most runs list this season 😂,4
Who was the one thar dropped the catch? Jadeja?,4
"Kohli getting possessed by Ishant ""Chakka maar dunga"" Sharma",9
"Despite that six, is Koach past his prime when it comes to T20, or just out of form?",0
Bravo and Dhoni discussion: How to play for NRR?,2
He can play? REALLY? IS THAT SO? good insight KP,4
No one plays a better anchor role than this freak. This is why everyone else in RCB should play their natural game.,7
Sexyyy shot,1
This is one of those matches where Kohli goes super saiyan on everybody's asses aka King Kohli mode,5
What a shot from Koach bruhhhhhhhh,3
Flicked for 6,13
Thats actual wow,3
Fucking hell what a shot. The bottom hand of Kohli is insane.,10
Kohli after facing 30 deliveries is a monster,2
Curran is gonna get a fuck from me. Whether he is bad or good.,3
Kohli ne aaj gaand maar li,2
This is extra pumped up Kohli,3
That shot gives dopamine charge!!,5
Godly,3
My lord what a six! VK 👌👌👌,11
What was that? A Koach special flick for six.,8
Kohli you beauty. Whatta shott,12
Of course Kohli had to peak when CSK is already struggling,7
Holy shit,5
Brilliant from Koach,7
What a shot!,5
Kohli showing dhoni what intent looks like.,11
Is it me or Faf and Jadeja only supposed to take catches for CSK?,17
Kohli the Maestro,8
And people say he's overrated. Open your eyes haters,10
"Struggles against left handers, except chennai cause fuck chennai right",9
Wrists of steel.,6
"Me after that shot:

* In Captain Holt's  voice: *Hot Damn!*",7
That flick went for a six? BC,11
"Viral kilo, WTF was that shot",9
Ah those wrists.,5
running down the wicket and flicking. wtf by Kohli,12
Bruh that probably went all the way,3
Asian wrists,6
Wow I don't want him to stop even though I support CSK,9
O boy this over was organic,8
Koach is pumped!,6
Case clear. Anushka bhabhi is Kohli’s lucky charm,13
"KL Rahul, are you watching?",11
What a class,6
Maybe Ajay Jadeja was right in suggesting that Sam should be dropped,3
Love to see Kohli on song,6
Koach to r/cricket - Baap kaun hai bc,15
"This Kohli guy seems good, he should play for India",34
Kohli you beautiful man,9
Jaha 4 hona tha waha 6 mil gaya jaha 6 milna tha waha 4 gaya. That's how the day is going that's how the 2020 is moving forward,5
Real Kohli only wakes up in 18th over. Remember that wt20 over against Faulkner.,6
[deleted],25
Fuck y'all for saying he was out of form,9
"We're getting to 160,yaay!!!",5
yes Koach,3
"I think if Koach keeps playing like this and hogs the strike, he can get 100 tbh",8
Kohli making the people who said he was playing a KL like inning eat their words,10
Someone was comparing Kohli to Dhoni!,2
Why bowl Curran at the death. He should bowl in the powerplay and in the middle,5
Kohli century?,4
That’s what I’m talking about,2
Kohli is back😍,6
Koach is getting a century here... I can sense it,3
"If stokes,vk and bumrah were to be released, who would   be sold at what price?",1
Holy moly kohli,3
Imagine if Kohli gets a 100 from here,3
"The one day it decides to rain in Bangalore and the power goes off...Kohli is out there whipping CSK

Fml",9
"That's it, boys. CSK's season is over. 

Let's see you all in 2021.",9
Why was Chawla dropped?,1
Man if kohli is in form as well and we remove finch for Parthiv and get moeen in instead of gurkeerat that's a pretty solid team with a ton of bowling options that also bats deep.,3
So what's RCB looking at 170? 180?,3
Kohli raawww,3
"RCB fans -

Aayenge, mere Curran aur Thakur aayenge.",3
God the game needed that over,3
"that would've been the ""obligatory Faf catch of the CSK game""",2
Who's the cred girl who sits at the back,7
"Expect for the match against MI, Finch has been dog-shit. Another match and he should be dropped. 

Koach can open, fuck middle order.",0
I hope Curran isn't just giving us free runs so he has something to chase later,2
bravo had to bowl there surely.,0
Kohli showing KL how he should have batted.,2
"Damn,glorious flick from koach!",0
Buppy da always fav,2
*sham tak khelenge to inki gand phat jaegi intensifies*,8
This Bappi Lehri ad is amazing lmao,7
Curran spanked,3
Great to see him back in touch. That 6 is beautiful to watch,1
Game Over. I thought this would be a close game of chasing 149.,4
"I think CSK are missing Raina a lot in the field. Even at his worst batting form, Raina was immense in the field, saving boundaries and taking half chances. Without him CSK is relying heavily on Faf, Jaddu is better at throws from the deep rather than catches.",4
RCB #ApnaTimeAyega intensifies ....,4
This is the Kohli we all wanted to see.,2
Tired of supporting csk this season. Really happy Kohli completely back to his old self.,2
Yesss,3
"Viral Kilo

Hell, yes. Aggression without cheating - everything Ponting wished to be but could never emulate to the same level.

Telling the world to fuck off and FOLLOWING it up with fuckoffesque performances - that's some alpha shit right there. Takes balls because if you fall flat, you become KL Rahul (lmao). Kohli has revitalised bragging about big dicks and then actually having a 13-incher - and that's a good recipe for fun times (no homo... I think?)

He's a spicee boii, is that Viral Kilo",10
RCB went from looking for 130-140 to 160-70 in 2 overs,7
Orange cap list....why do I hear boss music,7
He's making it look easy,8
Shoottt,5
I love Kohli in form.,10
Nobody can stop him now,6
Wonder who Twitter's gonna troll now,6
"He aggressive
He swears
He play ridiculous shots",4
He is back boys. He is fucking back.,6
Holy fuck Kohli. One man army.,10
Koach has unleashed Viral Kilo mode,7
"MS Dhoni against RCB:

794 runs from 25 innings

Avg: 41 SR: 143",3
Shafra Tharcher about to bowl,2
That's World number one batsman,7
Come on koach. Go for 3 figures.,4
Koach in his Chasing Beast Mode.,9
Who's that mini Shatrughan Sinha lookalike sitting in the RCB dugout..,2
"No not ma boy Thakur. Mercy VK, mercy.",3
I fucking love to see koach batting... Dopamine dopamine dopamine,4
Is this a bad pitch or nah??,2
2016 Kohli in sight,6
"Not getting the time to bat in IPL

Gurkeerat 🤝 Mandeep",7
Beautiful,3
Oh yes dadddyyy,2
Goosebumps,3
Can't watch the match rn. What is currantly happening to Sam?,3
"Thakur gonna Thakur 

- MK Gandhi",2
Now he is just showing off,2
I wanna jerk off to these sexy shots,5
Holy shit!,2
I've seen this before in 2016. He ended up with a 100.,6
KL Rahul furiously taking notes,3
Expect to chase to 200 lol this looks like peak Virat,1
Holy bois. Kohli is Back.,6
BHENCHOOOOOD......,3
People are so reactionary that they thought this man was washed after 3 bad games,17
I want more of this Virat,8
Just in case ya'll forgot how good he is,10
No bravo or chahar? Damn,4
Yup we're losing this,6
This is the difference between Koach and KLPD,8
That dance down the track is so good form Kohli. We are seeing vintage Kohli again,8
I hope Dhoni is taking notes. This is how you accelerate after eating up balls while the match is still alive.,17
Sam Curran is not a DEATH BOWLER,3
as a csk fan i’m ripping my hair out but i’m also really happy to see kohli in form,3
Dropped,5
88 mtr six on a slower ball and just by pure timing. Insane.,3
[Told y'all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j8jetr/match_thread_25th_match_chennai_super_kings_v/g8bv5sb?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),1
Koach 2016 activated!,5
Lol beamer,2
Kohli will get to 100 today,4
This is the 3rd match Jadeja has dropped a catch.,7
What happened to Faf and Jadeja today?,3
WHY THE FUCK IS JADDU LEAVING CATCHES,12
"Jadeja not taking catches, Wait that's illegal",9
Kohli going HAM!!!,1
Koach making Thakur re enter Dinda Academy.,6
Who are these fuccbois in the balcony,7
"Someone should keep a beamer count for this year

Its getting out of hands",5
This is going to 180 still... Lmao,4
Oh Jadeja lucky that was a no ball,8
"C - collapse

S - 

K -",10
Lord Thakur is back to what he does best... Leak runs..,3
Bowling coach kon h re ... death overs m slot bowls kaiko dalte bc,3
Can RCB get 170?,1
So why did Dhoni shave his head?,3
DADDY’S HOME!!!,2
So Morris is in the team as a pure bowler? Is he good enough to merit that?,1
Bruh why is Kohli hitting all these sixes. What in the actual world is he trying to achieve by increase his strike rate.,5
We are gonna fuck this up. Aren't we? Also is Munawar at the ground?,2
Jaddu wtf?,4
Great effort!,3
Jaddu dropping catches? This is 2020,7
Meme match,2
"No ball or not, what’s up with csk catching?",2
Here's the world's finest batsman for you!,2
So csk is wiped out of the tourney now if they lose this?,1
Jadeja wanted to enjoy the Kohli show.,3
Is this what it feels for a RCB fan?,5
Jadeja's fielding has been shit this tournament,7
How many catches has Jadeja dropped this season? Feels like one too many,2
Now we are getting confused a lot between Jaddu and Jaggi on the field,5
Saved 3 runs there! What a leap!,5
Koach 100 watch.,2
This is the Kohli we all knew. I missed this so much wtf,8
Beamer Premier League.,4
"Bring the Kohli stats, my body is ready",5
Jaddu is oiled up.,3
Virat shag me,8
Jagadeesan making up for the dropped catch,4
"Its horrible that bowlers aren't even trying yorkers at this stage. That's a drop yes, but that ball deserved to be hit, Thakur has no business bowling short at his pace.",1
Shardul bowling like Anushka,14
"Let me remind y'all that a few overs back a poll was conducted as to who's more valuable to their team, Kohli or Dhoni. People voted Dhoni 68% and Kohli 32%",4
Jaddu dropping catches. 2020 is very sus.,3
165 par score; 175 a winnable score. Kohli has a lot of work ahead.,3
Something is seriously wrong with Rahul’s head. He is clearly capable of this type of late game attack as Kohli is doing now. But he just refused to do it for multiple games.,9
Dhoni wants to beat Kohli so badly,5
Kohli relax 160 is the their aukaat. Don't exert yourself out there,5
Excellent BC,1
"Ah shit, here we go again",1
Why is the lady commentator going on about the dropper catch..it's  a noball,2
We always do this. Ball well for the first 15 overs and give away 20-25 odd extra runs in he end.,4
CSK doing some Punjab tier death bowling today,3
"So that's equivalent to a four, good",3
How the fuck is jaddu dropping catches this consistently?!,7
Virat Kohli’s sixes always just clear the boundary. He only spends the required amount of power to hit it.,5
Who are the umpires in this match?,1
Rahul needs to take notes,3
Jadeja to himself - Kohli ka catch mat pakad bc lega nahi side me,12
Jadeja dropping a few catches this year,7
Standard jadeja fielding there,3
Jaddu dropping 2 is so rare,12
We're witnessing the GOAT going beserk.,2
Sala composure hi nahi h csk bowlers m Dhoni se retirement hi sikh lo,2
"IPL FIELDING! MAN, THIS GUY IS GOOD!",6
My stream is slower than u/CricketMatchBot,5
"KP: csk needs a plan

Jeez genius",6
Koi catch hag raha hai koi khatarnak saves kar raha hai kya chalu hai bhai,3
Jadeja pulling off a Jagadeeshan,2
How mnay catches has Jadeja dropped this year? He should field inside the circle,0
Match is set if it's 170.,6
What's the chance CSK can chase 160+ now?,4
Kp : what do we need to do to execute what we need to do to make it happen,1
Alright Bois the match is lost,1
Never liked cricket anyway,9
Shivam Robbin koach's century,3
"if that catch was taken, would the 2 runs scored have counted?",7
"First DK, then KL & now Kohli (all scoring IPL Captain 50 today) so next MS will score 50 tonight?",6
"The thread needs some balance , please get this sucker Kohli out.",0
I know CSK have a Lion as their logo but there's one on the pitch this match holding an MRF bat.,2
Ffs,1
They aren't taking any catch today lol,3
this ipl is all over the place fielding wise,3
Kohli apology thread incoming,10
When a fielder like Jadeja drops multiple catches like that then you know something is not right with CSK.,4
This is bad fielding and field setting is also not accurate,3
Lol if u think Watson was going to catch that,6
That was some gully cricket effort of catching,3
"Is Dube even young enough to be calling Koach, bhaiyya?",7
What running is this oh my god,6
WatThatha,1
He hit it with the back of the bat,1
Very difficult to win after losing the toss on these grounds,2
We meed kohli on strike ffs,4
"This, this is the difference between general accumulators and kohli",11
Shane Nippson,1
"Shivam dube calls Kohli bhaiya lol, even when calling for runs",9
Sir Jaddu :(,0
Kohli century possible?,6
Keep kohli off the strike ffs CSK!,2
What is this end to such good 15 overs,3
Kuli must rejine. Fascist captain overrated player.,8
"Pimples : 0!

Blackheads : 0!

My hope: 0!",6
Do not take a single FFS!!!,3
CSK is defending like the 11 year olds in my gully.,3
Kohli 23 off the last over with a century and then RCB lose,11
Indian fielders are having an off season this year.,3
KP just take a breather mate.,7
Never doubting dube again. Saved us against MI. Doing a great job today,7
"Jesus, Dhoni’s right. Death overs this team forgets how to play. Bowling, fielding, bowling to your field. 

Obvs kohl’s smashing it around doesn’t help.",13
Leadership group match tomorrow.,6
Dubey sneaking his way back into the Indian Team,13
Fucking give kohli the strike.,6
Anyone younger would have got there.,5
Last 16 balls 52 runs.,9
Abey dube mc bc,8
Good recovery by Thakur imo,3
"RCB, this is exactly what we're not supposed to do, if we want to win I. E. Choking in the death",4
Fucking Dube,3
Dube has good figures. Cool. The 2s definitely help you with a couple boundaries.,2
"THAKUR WHACHU DOING MY MAN, GET THESE KIDDOS OUT BRO",4
In a world of Anchor's                                                                 Don't be like KL                                                                                         Be like Kohli,17
"""Dube want to be a contender of the Altroz super striker of the match"" - trust me Slats he does not want to",9
Wasn't that a wide?,2
This 2 dot ball gonna cost them.,5
23 of 6 for 100. What do you guys think?,5
in before Kohli 102(52),7
It is refreshing when we are the team hitting big at the death and not the team getting tonked around,6
How was that not a wide?,3
Nice stop them under 170 now,0
And Thakkur Giveth..... he is so consistent.,7
"Shivam should stay a bit low, he fails to get under many of those which he could've hit out of the park because his stance is too upright. But hey, I am just a random nobody with a keyboard.",3
that looked like a wide.,5
"Don't take single now Dubeji, We need Koach 100 today.",1
"Sunny G, taking potshots from the Hindi commentary box.

This time in Shane Watson's age.",1
Curran leaked a lot of runs last game too. He has been a bad bad boy.,5
I still think it’s a little too late especially given RCB’s bowling,3
I think RCB will reach 170,5
"RCB can’t score : pitch sucks, even 140 is defendable.

Kohli unleashes : great pitch for batting , min 150 required 

Pick one",15
KL should learn acceleration of innings from Virat,6
SRH really needs a senior Indian player. Kohli and Rohit are kind of like the “older brother” role to mentor the young players. Warner and Bairstow are great individual players but they don’t strike me as a mentor type.,7
24 in this over. Calling it now.,5
"All I want is Virat to get a 100

Is it too much to ask for",7
"The hdfc ad is so, so hilarious",4
"Any of the previous years, I'd expect CSK to even chase 210 against RCB, just cause",2
So was the pitch slow or was RCB just slow?,3
Kohli should not take any single in last over. Play all 6 balls,3
Shardul has improved with yorkers over the last year.,5
"Dube is the most overrated ""hitter"" in India. He fires 1/10 times and always shits the bed unless the ball is exactly in his slot. He has zero innovation and he is a dead duck against quality bowling, spin or pace. He is unreliable af and he doesn't know how to finish or construct an innings. 

Everyone got duped by his performance in the Mumbai T20 league.",10
Chaampion!!,5
Kohli scores so much today so that he can console himself while his bowling unit leaks 60 off the last 3 overs,7
Koach learning from ABD,4
ffs,2
"That was a wide!!!!!!

Slow-mo made it clear",3
What the fuck? You're Kohli not ABD,2
Kohli doing an ABD,4
Woah never seen VK do that 😁,8
Kohli: I AM THE MR 360 NOW,11
Never saw kohli playin this shot,3
Since when do Kohli play those type of shots.?,3
Virat 360° Kohli,7
Kohli learning from his real wife (Abd),14
Kohli needs to take the whole over. Stop giving the strike to Dube,3
Kohli you gorgeous 🥺,7
Bravo was like wtf bro,4
You just cannot be that good,3
Guys time to log out?????,4
[removed],8
NEVER seen Kohli do that,8
Virat Devilliers,7
Kohli - I'm the new ABD now,9
That is such an ABD shot,6
Kohli showing his quality skills,5
Playing with AB for 9 years finally paid off for Koach with that shot.,5
ABDesque shot from Kohli there,9
GOAT 🐐,12
Kohli can do a Sachin and ABD all in one. He's the best,11
Is that the first time Kohli has ever played that shot?,11
All is right with the world. The King has got into his groove.,12
Dube is 27 and Kohli is 31. So Dube calling Kohli bhayya is fine I guess?,15
kohli you monster,9
Bear witness to the King 👑,9
Kohli playing those shots lol. Seems so weird,9
Bravo Koach. What a shot.,12
AB de Virat,11
AB training Virat definitely.,8
That was a kill shot,11
Kohli channeling AB.,16
KP is such a simp for Kohli,18
Kohli learning from DeVilliers,17
Kohli playing that shot??? This motherfucking year.,36
"Kohli: *look at me, I’m the abd now*",13
Kohli doing an ABd,8
Kohli playing a very abd shot there,5
Phat se head shot,5
Definitely a 100 looming,4
"Virat ""ABD"" Kohli.",13
Kohli does ABD.,7
Expect 6 slow balls from bravo. Slower and slower with each ball. Just park and wait for the ball for an eternity to arrive.,4
Rcb now just mocking us,9
"This total is already in the ""play for the NRR"" zone",13
Return of the king,7
Why is Dube always expressionless. Even after a shot like that from VK,7
"Think this is a fairly easy track to score runs on, outfield is lightning",5
Kohli doing scoop shot; ive seen it all,10
Has Thakur left Dinda Academy? He comes back and finishes strong even if he shows glimpses of old Shardul from time to time.,7
Bravo lives for another day. That's was a shell coming at him,7
"Similar pattern every match of CSK bowling well and being economical first 15 overs and then relaxing for the next 5, allowing opposition to post competitive totals.",7
Cant wait for IND VS AUS now,8
"Sorry if it sounds toxic or anything, but Atleast I can rest easy knowing Kolhi won't get 100",-3
lmao Koach is possessed by ABD,16
Why is Bravo given the final over when Deepak Chahar is there ? (3 Overs/ 10 runs),7
Csk lost already,3
Kohli's reinventing himself. Couple of years ago he changed his game so he could hit sixes at will and now this,18
Chad Kohli vs Virgin Bravo,15
32 of last 9 balls by koach... This is how you pace your innings,18
Feels so good to see koach smile at this own shots,14
Kohli’s such a genius man,11
Crossed 160 with 4 balls to spare. AWESOME!,7
Bravo's finger almost fell off.,11
guligat,1
17(4) please lord have mercy,6
Koach no 7 on most runs list now,7
Admit it you do not have as much fun watching a player as you have watching Kohli,5
That clipped the finger... He's done for,5
I'm feeling Bravo's pain.,8
Seekh KL,1
"""I saw the other day Amit Mishra getting a stiff one"" is something I never want to even imagine",7
"Idk why, but I've always wanted to see bravo get murdered at death overs",4
Pretend this is a 17 off 4 run chase and Kohli will do it with a ball to spare,5
Dhoni and Bravo discussion what's for dinner lol,7
I'm so happy Kohli performed. Gotta bully the Australians later on and we need him.,4
Bravo could've died if it wasn't his hand,5
Now MS has to hit a classic Raina inside out over the covers to assert dominance,3
"Kohli can anchor, Kohli can accelerate and Kohli can absolutely smack. The best batsman in the world for a reason.",12
Fuck off with this shit,0
Kohli taking revenge on Bravo for unleashing Asia upon the world.,8
"Slowing down momentum, yellow yellow dirty fellow.",2
"With morris coming in, i definitely think rcb can defend this",4
"Reddit cricket commentary is so much fun!

PS: Kohli for 100",2
Fucking amazing running,4
Running at its best,4

What the actual fuck,4

So close,2
Oof! Brilliant running that,5
"Kohli is a fucking machine, nuff said",5
Watson is shocked seeing how fast Kohli runs,13
You machine.,8
"If Jadeja was a Kurkure piece, Jagdeesan looks like that abnormally long Kukure piece you find in the bottom of the bag.",8
What great running to complete that 2.,5
The umpire denied a fist bump to kohli. I'm losing it ahahaha,12
Smooth,2
That was fast as fuck holy shit.,18
"Wtf, no way that's 2",10
"BDE here from Virat, dube a known slogger but he's taking the strike and making the shots.",3
"After all this, I just hope RCB bowlers can keep their wits and bowl decently.",10
Koach on fire today.,9
Warner and Kohli running between the wickets 🤤,14
What a dive bc.,5
Why did they loose fair play points for that. Is kohli like just not supposed to hit that ball,7
DAMN KOACH WTH,10
"Spirit of the game is so intangible, what criteria do they use to give the fair play award?",2
Bruh this man runs!,5
Sunrisers are like Arsenal. They are 4th even on the fair play table,14
How the hell someone can run two there? Amazing levels of fitness.,8
I swear with RCB losing wickets at the other end like this Kohli is about as important to RCB as Sachin was to India in the 90s,24
Koach in turbo mood.,8
Straight into the stumps lmao,8
Century is fucked,6
Does this man ever get tired?,9
Why isn't chahar bowling what,5
No words for this running.,6
They don’t call him GOAT aise hi,11
Kohli masterclass.,9
Running 2s like that in 20th over Amazing,11
No viral kilo 100,6
Dube is fast af to keep up with this pace,12
"Well! Superman Kohli showed up today, not Clark Kent",16
Only virat can run doubles like that after facing 50 balls in current Indian team,54
Just imagine : Warner and Koach running between the wickets.,28
Koach Mohali Australia vibes 😳,40
"Dhoni after 17th over: Boys, we gonn' win this one.

Dhoni after 20th over: Well, lads, there always a next game.",29
"Jeez, this guy is a machine.",6
y'all actiing like Morris is saviour Lmao he barely makes it to the National side,14
"Bruh, this running",13
"If it's not a four or a six, I'll take 2
- VK",53
Dube lost kgs by running,12
Three 2s in 3 balls fucking hell,14
"Suarez: I’m the best diver
Kohli: Hold my beer",12
That vegan stamina,19
Kohli is machine confirmed.,10
This is some crazy running.,7
We came to this match expecting two meme teams playing against each other but we'll leave remembering the Kohli show.,6
Dube: Thank the heavens Kohli is hogging all the strike,9
4 doubles wow.,3
Kohli single handedly saved the innings,16
Madlad running Veekay!!,15
Damn kohli gets tired?,4
Kohli maintaining the 200 S/R,9
"Question - When that DJ cheers, is it only for the TV or do they hear it in the stadium",5
"What a fucking monster, all those efforts in the gym made him complete the second, small margins.",10
Kohli you sexy bitch,7
This is a top notch innings.,5
What an absolute master class ! And peeps say Babar Azam is a better T20 batsman. lulz,19
Somebody think of poor Dube,8
CSK is like let’s consider these 2s as 1s.,4
Due would probably need a ventilator,13
Dube probably has never ran this much in his entire life,58
No better player than him to find those gaps and milk those 2's.,6
[deleted],10
This has been an innings of some acceleration,8
Kohli's really come a long way since getting dismantled by Albie Morkel,14
"Smart from Kohli, taking 2s and ensuring they post a defendable score",6
"Dube running those 2s: 

'Mein madarchod jo is me aaya'",66
"Giving Karn Sharma another over even after he had given 26 runs in 3 overs and not giving the final over to Chahar 

Ladies and Gentlemen, India's best captain!! Khelo Dimag se",2
Check on Dube ji. His Oxygen levels probably dropped to dangerous lows,76
Kohli tired as heck,3
Kohli is unbelievable with his running,16
"How fit are these guys, damn.",18
The fitness of this man,14
Fruits of Kohli's rigorous training can be seen right now.,56
"Make no mistake, this is a Virat Kohli special! Not many can play that way, on such a deck, and not to forget his running between the wickets.Absolutely brilliant pacing of the innings, only one GOAT.",67
Koach has played just 5 dots,90
Damn he only played 5 dots,57
"Dhoni and csk are the masters of slowing down the game when the opposition is in the upper hand. 

Vs SRH dhoni was asking for gloves and all kinds of breaks because he was gassed and the SRH bowling lineup is inexperienced. 

Now making kohli wait for each ball. 


It is like tactical fouling in football. I hate and love it at the same time.",22
Harsh call,4
Death stare forced the umpire to give wide,52
"Everyone praising kohli tor running. 

Noone acknowledging dube running and keeping up. 

Sad cat thumbs up",147
99 ?,2
Would love to see Kohli race someone like Mbappe.,42
Just 40 of these runs in boundaries. Kohli is a freak of nature,34
RCB finally being good? Damn.,24
Still within the realm of possibility for CSK. They should back themselves.,16
Rohit would've declared by now,51
"If anyone is angry why these are all 2s and not 4/6s, any other batsman they would be 0/1s.",92
That's not a wide,4
This has been a masterclass Kohli innings...,22
Lol that wasn't a wide. No way,3
"Quick doubles for his former Indian Captain, Dhoni

Half century dedicated to his pregnant wife

A scoop on wide delivery for De Villiers, his RCB team-mate

Kohli making sure every RCB fan is happy.",31
Well played Dube.,4
14 off the over with one 4,16
Credits to Dube too. Nice knock and impressive running,15
And just like that they batted csk out of the game,6
Koach is the GOAT,19
"Kohli 90(52)

Rest: 79(68)",37
Well played Koach!,8
"So, is the score good? Par atleast?",1
[deleted],18
Jokes on Dhoni and Bravo they allowed Kohli to get his breath back,57
Bravo bowled a very good over. Koach still took 13 runs of it.,18
Only Kohli made 11 2s in this game,20
No way CSK chases 170,7
Anushka Bhabhi,1
70 runs in the last 5 over ffs.,7
Advantage: RCB.,5
Fell one run short of 170,2
"This inning by VK, this is what KL wanted to do. What a batting by The Giant 💪🙏👌👏",11
Much respect 🙌🙌,6
Get Faf early please,9
That IS a wide when it’s bowled to King Kohli. Otherwise it isn’t.,-4
That was peak kohli batting,13
If I was Anushka my loins would be on fire rn,18
170 isn't a bad score. Get CSK top order early and they'll fold like a house of cards,19
"I feel sad for Gurkeerat. He either doesn't get picked or gets picked but never gets to bat. Last time he got a chance he scored 65 (48)

He has been the scapegoat when team balance comes into picture.",16
14 runs in the last over despite only 1 four.,40
Greatest of all damn time🐐,23
Remind you This isn't a batting pitch,17
"Watch and learn, KL",19
[deleted],33
"Not the worst over by Bravo, considering a set Kohli at crease.",8
Why the fuck would he do that?!,8
CSK probably gained 69 fair play points in this innings,10
Good over,4
Absolutely unbelievable,16
Kohli is the best t20 player since bradman,27
"Damn Koach, what a know that was",8
"BTW, Finchy should be rested imo. The man's struggles are real",9
King for a reason,13
We love you Koach!,14
"It’s been a while since we’ve see a vintage Kohli innings like this. Boundaries, mad running between the wickets and the acceleration. Classic.",18
Well played Koach 👏👏,10
King Kohli 👑,8
Ohh madam ji in town.,11
"That was an excellent last over from Bravo, and it still went for 14. Thats how good Kohli is",28
This innings is kind of like kkr's innings earlier today,6
Anushka bhabhi is there at the stadium !!,19
"Koach is love

Koach is life",15
King Kohli,15
"Class batting from Kohli. Finch needs to go. Pitch is tricky, so hopefully total should be enough. Would have liked to see Zampa.",12
[deleted],15
74 of last five... Great finish on this slow pitch,14
Kohli must be surrounded by yes men,1
Perfect target for some spicy Dhoni shithousery,18
Anushka in dressing room I can already see controversy,30
I'll take the one 69 anyday,9
Waifu-powered innings 💯,18
Bhabhiji ❤️,11
RCB beat me by 20 runs.,4
Great death batting. Kohli God mode is awesome to watch,25
"This is the Kohli we want, this is the Kohli we preach. At his absolute best.",17
"King kohli showed his class today. Instert Warne's voice in the Background- form is temporary, class is permanent.",16
Pandya is the only cricketer who doesn't look out of place in these Dream XI ads,18
"Surely Kohli body would be feeling down rn, take this time and hit please",5
"if bowlers can't defend this score, I would criticise KOHLI for not leaving RCB",19
Finch cost RCB a 180 here,17
"169 is very defendable, especially if RCB bowl a good powerplay and don't, you know, do an RCB",15
"OOTL Why do you call Kohli ""Koach""??",13
"Kl: Strike rate is overrated
Kohli: Rahul is overrated",63
"Yeah It will be difficult winning it with our oldies converting doubles into singles and singles to dots. 
Jesus Christ Kohli!",47
No Vijay + No Jadhav + RCB bowling = Chaseable Target.,2
Batting masterclass from Koach.,9
"Dube is absolutely aggravating. He is built like a bulldozer, plays like a Luna.",13
"Even though these players are used to playing 50 overs, the insane running and UAE weather make them tired. Some dots in ODI are ones in T20 and some singles in ODI are twos in T20.",6
"The man has scored 11 2s and only 5 dot balls in a 51 ball innings, such a 🐐",30
RCB only needs to get CSKs openers early to win.,12
"Dube also played very well, some specific prolific players couldn’t have run as much as he did.",20
"Csk's fielding once again fucked them up, that dube drop was worth 6 runs alone, quite a few misfields aswell",16
"So another take 140/6 chasing a huge total. 

Sigh.",14
"100 in the 16th over to 170, wp Virat",11
"This is typical Kohli inning, patience and class  
No competing with him as a 3 format player",37
Cricinfo writers will somehow blame Kohli for starting slow and call this inning bad,15
GOAT.,7
74 runs in the last 5 overs.,8
[called it.. just 10 short](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j8jetr/-/g8bvlbk),3
KL should learn to pace innings from Kohli to finish games properly rather than losing won games,27
"""1 69 please."" - Kohli, probably",19
"IT WILL BE SO FUN AGAIN SEEING FAF AND WATSON CARRY THE LINEUP

RIGHT?",10
That was an absolute master class from Virat. Salute.,11
"If there's a better all-round batsman in world cricket at the moment, I haven't seen him. Kohli is a fucking beast.",16
This is how to make use of a start KL,15
Why wasn't chahar given his final over,5
Kohli should open CSK's innings to keep his momentum going,12
"what creative DJ shouts ""RCB wants sixerrr, Chennai wants wickkket "" so loud, through the last over. It must be so annoying for the players in the ground.",15
66 off the last 4 overs even tho none of them except the Curran over had a flurry of boundaries. Running between the wickets was awesome.,15
"Csk bowling 101:

If (!gettingHit):
    Gethit()
else:
    BalltoWideLine()",10
Wtf happened? We weren't even looking at reaching 120 and we hit 170?? Wtf the one time I don't watch the match and rcb actually hit?,17
170? That's 200 in CSK's number.,15
"Will wonders never cease? RCB making logical decisions in selection, bat first after winning the toss, decisions in the batting order making sense...still have to bowl well.",7
Needs a Watto Faf special.,3
Dube has such a soft voice. Good going kiddo,8
Given that it was Kohli who did all the acceleration we don't actually know if it was the wicket easing up or him going God mode.,34
Dube’s voice does NOT match his face,33
Gurkeerat hasn't batted for the last 3 matches,8
"Either we win this match by 10 wickets or we lose, there's no middle ground here",43
Dube and Hazlewood have double dimples,10
"How is this for a lineup?
 
Parthiv 
Paddikal
Kohli
Ab
Moeen
Sundar
Dubey
Morris
Udana
Saini
Chahal

7 full-time bowler.
8 batsman
Ab doesn't have to keep.",14
Dube doesn’t even look tired after all that quick running,12
"CSK failed to chase similar total against SRH, Punjab failed against KKR, you never know RCB might win this.",13
RCB matches are never good for the heart,14
I know it’s the coldest take in the world but damn Kohli 🐐🐐🐐,12
"I think out of batting, balling, fielding... Running between wickets may be Dubey's strongest area",16
Kohli just open for gods sake and 2016s sake.,16
"Sometimes we forget that for an international premium batsman Kohli, the likes of Thakur, Curran, 38 year old Bravo are easy pickings, when he needs to tackle the likes of Rabada, Starc, Archer at international level and still can murder them on his good days.",31
"Kohli 90(52) Not out

If he had opened, century was on the cards. 
Kohli is too good a batsman in this line-up to not open.",16
Kohli fitness is simply amazing..,5
"**Brilliant innings by King Kohli**

He was 34*(30) after 14 ~~16~~ overs then smashed 

6,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,4,6,2,6,1,6,2Nb, 1,4,2,2,2,2,1.

Balls 11-20: 13 (10)

Balls 21-30: 9 (10)

Balls 31-40: 25 (10)

Balls 41-52: 31(12)",19
I'd pay good money to see Mboopi Donatello padded up and running v Koach. I reckon Koach has him if they're both kitted up,1
Also Kohli’s innings is a perfect example of what Rahul couldn’t convert his into,8
"This is what Dhoni had been doing for more than a decade. 
Taking it deep till the last over.
Now that he has aged, he isn't able to do it anymore and INTELLECTUALS here fap to his failures. Also Dhoni must let go of his ego and accept he is old. No more taking it deep strategy

Well Played Kohli and RCB🔥
I hope CSK doesn't screw up again, still an easy chase.",12
That was some amazing running between the wickets godamn,11
"IDC if we lose because score isn't that big, but Virat played a good innings, that my friends feels good.",10
"I'm getting really excited for the India Australia ODI and Test series now. Mayank, Koach, Rohit, Shami, Bumrah, Ashwin, and Pant are playing well so far. Excited to see that they are making the most of this IPL to regain momentum after the Covid layoff. It's going to be a cracking series",12
Kohli should dedicate this evening to Sunny Bhai,9
Kohli back in form - Everyone likes that,13
"Kohli last 3 innings : 72,43,90 what a comeback from master",16
For some reason i hate it when a batsman who's going good remains not out... I always wonder where he would have ended up if he got more balls to play,10
[deleted],24
Why didn't Chahar and Jadeja completed their quota? They had 1 and 2 overs left respectively.,4
53(39) to 90(52),19
Wonder if this is a good total. It looks like Kohli took some time to get going. But who knows with RCb bowling,13
So business as usual then. Should lose by 8-10 runs,30
Virat Kohli changing gear in T20 format is one of the best sight with proper cricketing shots.,17
KL: If strike rate is so important why doesn't Koach have the orange cap.,20
"**Kohli highest score against current IPL team**

113 vs KXIP

100 vs KKR

99 vs DC

93 * vs SRH

92 * vs MI

90 * vs CSK

72 * vs RR",10
"in the middle overs rcb replicated csk

in the death overs csk replicated rcb",9
What a knock. Hope the bowlers don't let us down.,6
Momentum is with Blore but I’m betting on CSK to win this rather comfortably,2
"Jadhav be  watching the  RCB batsmen in the last 3 overs and going ""This be beyond science""",34
Will MSD also come to party?,0
Dube has that Tendulkar voice,9
"People trashing Kohli in the match thread. Here you fucking go. This is Kohli. No partnerships with no singles, but when he does get it, it's done.",30
>,0
"182 is the average first innings total here. In that context, CSK has bowled well.",5
How good a batsman is jagadeshan?,5
The six over midwicket by Kohli was mindblowing,9
"Kohli inning progression -

Virat ""KL Rahul"" Kohli -> 

Virat ""Ms Dhoni"" Kohli ->

 Virat ""King""  Kohli ->

 Virat ""Abd"" Kohli  -> 

Virat ""Usain Bolt"" Kohli",110
Hard to overstate how difficult it is change gears even when you're set and have been batting for majority of the innings. KL and Kohli's innings today are a study in comparison.,30
That Kohli innings somewhat reminded me of the T20 world cup innings vs Australia,24
"No wonder VK started performing again, Anushka’s there",15
"Idk why Morris is being hyped so much, he will get our good ol' rcb virus and go for 50(4.0)",14
It's simply amazing..he was languishing in 40s..then goes into the super saiyan mode.. it's a either a boundary or a 2..,23
"Where is the clown who wrote that shitty piece ""whether Kohli should be in the XI in t20s?"" Some cunt named Venkat or something",91
No matter which teams you support you just can't hate on Kohli. The man's a machine.,68
We depend entirely on Watson Faf Rayudu. If even 2 out of those 3 fall then it's going to be a very hard time.,5
Bravo and Curran should bat above Jagadeeshan imo,6
"Fun fact: I had to get a yearly subscription on hotstar just to watch 2.5 months of ipl. If csk doesn't make it to the playoffs, depression incoming bois",30
My favourite part is that Kohli 90 in 52 is somehow so much better than anybody else's 90 in 52.,20
Koach really hates singles. He's been burned too many times clicking on those hot singles ads.,45
I think Rcb will defend this.,6
"Anuska in the dugout and Kohli 90\*, Wheres your headline now?",12
74 runs from the last 5 overs.,5
"Those doubles in the last over, and run out scare are the testament to his fitness standard.

 can't imagine anybody else pulling those off",13
"Kohli never gives up which is what makes him special. He could've easily settled for 80(52) like KL, Pandey etc. and no one would've blamed him. I know it is a meme at this point but he never lacks the intent.",94
Let Dhoni Open,11
Man kohli is entertaining to watch bat.,17
Scenes if vada pav rohit was at the non striker's end and had to run these twos,26
Virat Kohli casually averaging 55,20
So is immediate family part of the bio secure bubble ?,10
Y’all saying KL should do this do that after watching Kohli are tripping. Kohli is arguably the greatest limited overs batsmen. You think if KL could just simply learn he wouldn’t do that ?,30
[deleted],34
"From 50(39) to 90(52) 

Koach is unreal.",24
Huge dhoni fan but i think KP is blowing dhoni in public rn,10
What did Dhoni tell Jadeja? Anything funny? Stump mic.,2
The hourly thala sucking up has begun,10
"Drop finch, get Parthiv to open and get Moen ali to get some overs and batting",2
Why did Koach drop Siraj after he bowled well the last game?,3
So it is Anushka behind Kohli's king innings no? Just asking.,14
"4 fours and 4 sixes for Kohli this innings.

So those got him 40 runs from 8 balls, outside of that he got 50 (44) from purely running between the wickets. That is next level.",47
"Earlier: RCB made a mistake by releasing  KL Rahul

Now: Nahi chahiye, bhai 

[T: Don't want]",5
Why can’t KP stop talking about Dhoni. CSK is more than just “Dhoni this Dhoni that”.,29
No one else can do what Kohli does,24
mamba mentality from Kohli.,12
Guess the QuantumOfLoss^TM for CSK today??,8
"Strategy in this IPL when batting first is to get to 120-130 for maximum 4 wickets by over 15, then smash and smash and head towards 200.",9
Man these folks at star sports simps dhoni so hard,22
"Today's match, that 1st T20 vs WI and the group stage match vs Pak in CT2017 (not the doomed final) show what makes Kohli a class apart from others. You'll think Kohli is terribly out of form today because he isnt able to hit it out and he will be nothing but dead weight. 



Then suddenly one good shot and he is back to being The King. Supreme confidence and godly skills result in mad acceleration and he goes from 34(30) to 90(52).",19
Slow paced pitch = 150 runs. CSK batting woes this season so -10 runs. RCB bowling attack so +30runs. Total = 170. CSK to win. Can't argue with math,18
"Kohli must open. Instead of going after Mann's head, who has done nothing wrong, drop Finch and play Kohli in his place. At 3, play Philippe as a keeper as well",11
"bois, is it okay to want csk to win just because they dropped KeJa?",4
Anushka in the house... Gavaskar runs the other way,16
[deleted],11
"Kohli took 2's where watson wouldnt take 1's lmao.
..

Ps- Watson would go for 1 six in 3 balls rather than 3 2's on 3 balls...wide boi uses biceps muscle power...not some vegan shit leg power😪",27
I hope rcb win this so that this masterclass innings from kohli doesn't go waste,16
Kohli's 90* is the highest score by a captain against CSK in IPL,10
Idt Sam bowled badly tbh. Just great batting and shit fielding,10
"True story: One of my annoying coworkers had been bragging that she met Virat Kohli at a party and had been hanging out with him. Nobody believed her. She was pretty and I guess somewhat well connected, but come on, she couldn't even tell you what ""coverdrive"" meant. Had to be bullshit, right?

Well last Diwali we had an office party and rumor was that she was going to bring him. When I got there, there was no sign of her though and everyone was kind of poking fun of her usual bullshit. As usually happens to me in social situations, I eventually get too anxious and have to find a quiet place to recharge in. I duck into my boss’s office and turn on the lights and almost had a fucking heart attack. FUCKING VIRAT KOHLI IS IN THE ROOM SITTING ON THE PHOTOCOPIER MAKING PHOTOCOPIES OF HIS ASS. Scattered all around the room were dozens of photocopies of his bare derriere. He didn’t even acknowledge my presence with embarrassment or cover up. He just looked me dead in the eyes, reached over and pressed the print button again.

Fucking Virat Kohli.",53
"Normally if you take a batsman’s boundaries away, you can expect a strike rate of around 30-50. Kohli’s today was 119.

He played 5 dot balls. Elite",104
"After ABD got out, I expected RCB to settle around 140 with Kohli playing an anchor knock due to lack of middle order. This is a masterpiece from the man, the way he paced the innings. Unlike KL who gets stuck on the 5th gear, Kohli showed when to switch. And now the Sub & internet will go crazy again ...",17
"Oh shut, Morris is playing",1
Pietersen seems like a smooth player. Like someone who could get some action if and when he wants.,10
"So, I went for dinner at around the 15 over mark. Wtf?",13
Csk looking to improve their NRR by losing by less than 5-10 runs today. Getting closer and closer to losing by 1 run.,9
"Another match where Mann didn't bat and might not bowl, lol

Gotta feel for him. Remember him playing well in that innings with Hetmyer",9
RCB fans and team including Kohli are having really high hopes on Morris. Hope he delivers for them but for me he was just okay for Delhi last couple of years.,15
"Gonna be weird seeing Morris in another jersey. Had played so well for us, he won't disappoint you RCB fans!",11
What's with Indian batsmen performing better with their wives watching in stadium and why is BCCI against it?,12
This is out of CSK's reach if Fafa and watson are gone .,6
"Dube has been good with his cameos, hoping that Morris impresses today",5
Was anushka with the RCB management or with fans?,8
"Even Dugout has to say shit like ""Dream11 game changer innings of the match"" wtf. What is the point then.",6
10 runs in 4 overs incoming.,16
Kohli showing Paddikal how its done!,4
Dhoni after Kohli's innings: Faster hai toh hai,10
"https://twitter.com/the_kk/status/1304291374326448128?s=19

🤡",7
"When I realise peterson, watson and Dhoni are almost same age",19
Kohli is clearly a better player but brohit is a better actor and its not even close.,23
CSK: Openers or bust,12
"In between, Virat Kohli ran 50 of his 90 runs in his T20 innings",20
"One shot against Bumrah, and Kohli has regained all his confidence. /s",30
"Just here to watch either of the CSK openers getting out early, and then CSK crawling towards the target only to lose by less than 10 runs",12
Paddikal is really lucky to have Virat as his mentor. He's going to benefit so much from it.,21
I feel so basic when kohli raises his bat and Anushka proudly claps and my heart starts beating fast,19
Which one is the meme team again?,14
Kohli is such delight to watch and I am not talking about his batting.,20
Kohli can metamorphosize into an Andre Russell at the death overs,22
50 runs just from running Kohli is insane,28
And the sculpt aka Faf walks in.,3
If the format for IPL were Test instead of T20 matches. Which squad would be the favourites to win with the same Round Robin and playoffs format in Indian grounds and no limit on number of overseas players playing in the match? With the points awarded same as the ICC Test Championship.,2
"And bois,what did you have for dinner?",7
Baby Kohli attended today’s match and daddy Kohli scored big.,14
170 gettable. Openers were too slow perhaps?,1
gurkeetrat didn't get to bat,2
Maybe its just me but Why would anyone make their pregnant wife travel from India to UAE for a cricket match during pandemic?,11
All it took was one classic RCB collapse^tm to bring Kohli back,9
Replace Sam Curran with Tahir😶,-3
Who do you think will Saini injure today?,5
Watching this IPL there is no shortage of classy Indian opening batsmen. Since you all can't use all of them clearly you should loan that Padikkal to us.,6
Kohli! 🙏,2
"Kohli's back aching from carrying RCB on his shoulders. How useless have the overseas players been this season? Finch has been just utter garbage this season. Moeen Ali was given a few chances and failed. ADB has clicked but also not in a lot of matches.

RCB might be the only team who doesn't use the full quota of 4 overseas players",6
Will Saini play well today?,7
"**Highest scores in IPL with less than half runs in boundaries**


90 * - Kohli v CSK, today

"I want jokes and nothing else from this innings, the ipl deserves it",3
Morris to Faf. I can only see Faf winning,2
How can anyone not like Koach? Rarely do you see someone so passionate about something and intense. The guy's truly an inspiration!,22
Wtf why was jadhav dropped ? Too much chopping and changing .,10
Last match's run chase must be on CSK 's mind,1
"Can they lay solid foundation today? Wtf Bangar. Solid foundation for who? If one of them isn't there in the middle to finish, they are not winning the match.",7
Time to shit the bed csk 🤣,0
RCB loves South Africa,10
Watson is the most nervous starter ever omg,10
Bowl inswingers instead lol,0
"When I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but Virat Kohli!

I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Virat, but she just wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Virat put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.

Anybody else met him and have any stories to share?",19
Morris looking to prove a point.,2
Seen someone write this IPL's been boring barring couple matches here and there. That innings was totally worth it.,3
Morris baby wow,2
"Ah, typical Morris",2
I only watch ipl to see dhoni win and kohli lose idk what im gonna do from next year,-13
"Meat eaters : oh but cricketers can't be vegan and play well. Where will they get all the protein and strength from?

Kohli : hold my fruit",12
"Which ground is this, Old Trafford? Look at that sweet movement in the air. 




Oops. As I type this, Watto hits a 4.",9
Lovely movement,3
"Watto's most heartbreaking moment in my mind is when Aditya Tare hit that six off Faulkner. Watto was the captain of that side. When the six was hit,  his expression was heartbreaking, it was utter disbelief. He took his cap off in heartbreak as he watched Tare scoop it and then celebrate right at his face.",15
Morris to be steyn of last season vs csk?,8
There is so much swing! Fuck!!,6
Ex-CSK bowling to Ex-RCB....,16
Morris is the kinda bowler who bowls 4 good balls and 2 bad.,7
What a stop by VK,1
Koach ka fitness..🙏🏽,6
[deleted],8
Should've played Steyn if it was gonna move this much :(,9
"Given that Morris didn’t bat, wouldn’t Steyn have been a better choice with ball moving around",2
Started off as a generic RCB vs CSK rivalry. But its gonna be remembered as a Kohli classic.,16
If Punjab releases KL Rahul how much will he go for in auction.,9
At least Watto showing intent. What did finch do,7
We can open with Moeen if we want to. Extra bowling option too. What say RCB fans? Moeen for Finch?,10
Watson is just like a bigger better version of Finch.,31
What do we do with Finch?,3
I legit forgot Umesh is still a part of RCB,12
Bowl Sundar!,1
do csk play those eleven players who have the hardest nipples in the setup?,11
Hope we see the Saini against RR/MI. Not the Saini against DC,4
Saini don't kill our only two in form batsmen,3
How the fuck did they send sundar instead of Morris to bat ? Wasn’t Morris a big time hitter couple of years ago ?,9
haha Styris was deep into his analysis why Saini shouldn't start. Koach did him dirty there.,5
"Dhoni this season:

Runs - 102 in 5 innings

Average - 51 

SR - 132 

7 fours and 4 sixes

That’s better than Russell, Maxwell, Smith, AB, Hardik, Morgan - all players that this sub collectively sucks off and gives a pass despite having a shit season. 

But Dhoni? r/cricket fucking shits on him at every opportunity despite being one of the best players this season. Fucking give me a break.",-4
Hope sundar bowls soon,4
KL will be one of the most underwhelming winners of the orange cap.,15
Bowlers on the money,2
Tuk tuk openers are back. Inb4 RRR is 18 in last 5 overs.,1
"Alright lads, so I no longer have my 100% win rate for RCB matches I watch after the DC defeat, but I still feel a deep emotional connection to this meme team so will continue to show my support for Virat Kohli's barmy army till I die",12
Jadhav probably: I would have tapped it,2
Atleast it wasn't a beamer,9
3 dots...a wild Jadhav unzips,9
Slats gonna play for CSK haha,4
[deleted],2
Common RCB!!! Bowl us some no balls.,2
Someone tell KL Rahul the objective was for the team to win not him winning orange cap.,16
Finchy played one good innings and that got him an extended run in the tournament. He was not a good buy at all. Moeen and Morris are must for RCBs balance.,6
Stay off the coke Slats,2
"There has been a massive buildup of calcium in MS Dhoni's bones that throughout most of his career there was a weak affinity between his bones and trace amounts of calcium carbonate in the stumps. So he was able to electromagnetically 'anchor' himself to the stumps while batting and play those helicopter shots that should be impossible for mere mortals. This also explains his insane speed behind the stumps. He is already attracted to them in the first place, so he is able to execute stumpings at unbelievable speeds.

Over the last decade his body has slowly metabolised the calcium deposits he was able to accumulate while drinking six litres of milk per day and now his calcium levels are returning to normal. That is why he's unable to hit as far as he used to, and if he keeps playing we will see him get slower behind the stumps.

This is all because of inflation. The government could have subsidised milk for Dhoni, but they did not. Blame the government. Dhoni could have been a God among men, but now that will never come to pass.",16
RCB should start parthiv at top and plat some overseas batsmen for no.5 or 6,-2
That Bouncer 😍,4
Kohli knows he just needs to break this partnership. Anyone can bowl at death against CSK.,9
[deleted],29
Why is CSK batting always slow 😭,3
Isuru and Morris for the death,3
Virat is somehow on the 6th place on orange cap list despite being shit for the first 3 games,13
"If we ever get back international cricket, here's my dream odi team for india:

"CSK isn’t actually having as bad a season as people here are suggesting. They’ve actually been decent.

They’ve won 2/6 chases.

Other teams combined have won 3/16 chases.

I didn’t count the 2 super over matches cuz the first innings was tied. CSK have been unlucky that they’ve been losing the toss.",7
"Ok guys Kohli Stats™ time:

Ok irrelevant to the match but anyone thinks KL is playing slow because KXIP's middle order is hit and miss and tail is long as. I mean Mujeeb comes at 7. Maybe it is not a tactic to get him the orange cap,3
What was kolhi waving at?,2
There needs to be a better way to determine the mvp than the way the IPL currently does where they count the runs and wickets people take. Because those alone are very deceptive. Do like american sports and ask reporters/journalists to decide it.,3

Reminder. Australia has won twice as many orange caps than India 😎,3
Is it just me or does  anyone just get nervous Watson might get out whenever he's on strike?,8
"Udana isn't great as a new ball bowler, nor as a death bowler. Maybe he would be useful in second half of the tournament with slow wickets, but Steyn would be a better fit for now.

Steyn has great seam movement, and he could be used like Cummins with three overs bowled upfront, or all four really with Morris and Saini towards the end.",5
"Should take away Finchy's  chewing gum and make entire fielding team blow boomer bubbles in his face

"Finally being married and an expectant father has brought smile to Kohli's face on field from his otherwise always pumped, passionate, angry self. 

I hope I can say the same about me some day.",14

Wish there was a FIFA like game for cricket so that we can actually see how Kohli's pace compares with other players.,9
"Now that Mark Nicholas puts it that way, it seems sort of a toxic workplace environment where a mistake can anger your supervisor into a fit.",9
Bowl Sundar already,2
Saini looks like a freight train rushing in to bowl,5
Come on Koach bowl Washington,2
KKR will go into leisure mode after playing CSK and KXIP in a row. Both those teams inexplicably lose matches from winning positions.,6
Zzzzzzzzz,5
"Miss the days of Bazz, Dwayne & Hayden opening for csk",10
Bring in Sundar please. His lengths have been outstanding,10
RCB are lucky they need just one wicket to get into the tail,15

Watson struggles to score anywhere apart from flicks at start of his innings. don't bowl at the legs and you're looking at 30 runs in the powerplay.,2
Why do most of the Indian players dont have muscular body? Like having muscle gives more strength ( just look at jofra archer),2
Chennai Slow Kings,10
I'm only a little stitious.,2
"In my younger days I always thought that the leave was a cowards way of playing but as I have grown older I see the inherent alpha-ness of a good leave. Making the bowler run like your personal porter and throw that shiny leathery cork rock at your visage. All of his sinews screaming and muscles mangled as they contort themselves to cause maximum damage to you. Yet you stand defiant with a smirk on your face as the ball passes by helpless, impotent, longing to cause pain and denied with impunity. God I love a good leave.",21
"Boo where is silly stuff or the heart racing stuff 
This can't be a marquee clash",1
CSK is back 😍😍,13
peak test match batting..,4
This is actually fair. CSK openers never get to do the 'final 3 over CSK  simulation'.,3
"based on past experiences, i will not be keeping hope in rcb bowling in this moment and the whole match till the last ball idc",8
Why wouldn't kohli bowl sundar in the powerplay? Just why?,-2
Rcb bowling looks refreshing good,1
Mark Nicolas looks like the classic 50 year old sexy man who cheats on his wife in Hollywood movies,7

CSK NOOB,1

CSK are gonna capitulate aren't they,7
Hey does anyone know what did KL say in the post match interview?,3
Kohli just played 5 dots in his innings. Watson played 9 out of first 10 lol,9
Watson is one of those rare guys who actually bats quicker outside the powerplay,2

The whole team is drilled with “take it deep” which is terrible strategy on pitches that die as the game progresses.,9
Fielders for Watto at deep mid wicket and fine leg. Bad time to pull,7
"Yes...watson pulls a lot...so we put a fielder there...whom do we put ? Chahal...
Man if watson connects well...chahal will go into stands with the ball🤦",19

Not CSK if the asking rate isn't 12 when Dhoni comes out,2
Udana should not bowl in pp,3
INTENT™©CSK,6

This is the issue with Udana. Always bowls 1 loose ball,13
"Thanks, Udana. Very cool.",3

You have to hit in the power play. It’s inexcusable.",4
Kill the DJ please,8
If csk are serious about winning they really need to start using Curran as the 3rd or 4th batsman rather than 6th or 7th.,3
The chick in the Oppo ad looks alien. Is she pretty? Is she not pretty? Is she human? I just don't feel any answers,3
Getting Shane Watson out is a lot like the eating of an orange,5

The fuck is that watson chant lol,5
This was like waking up at night to Chug some cold water,2

CSK should go for Rahane in the mid season transfer window he is a good opener,3
This playing XI doesn't work for CSK. They need Umesh to play for RCB... Missed masterstroke by Dhoni,7

Sunny G can criticize anyone...,1
"Where are the CSK fans who downvoted me to oblivion for saying CSK ain’t winning shit.

Like do you guys watch the matches or just jerk off over past glory?",1
Sundar has been bowling beautifully. Really have to appreciate it.,3
Watching CSK is fucking disappointing holy fuck. This team is ass.,3
"The Kohli fist pump is the third greatest aphrodisiac after a double platinum credit card and the cocaine that gets snorted off said credit card. The potency of the Kohli fist pump makes it a controlled substance and purchasing even a microgram can get you on a list wherein an assortment of NSA, FBI and DEA agents spy on you in various ways. If I were you I would be very careful with my purchases of the Kohli fist pump. I'd recommend staggering your purchases, a nanogram here, a picogram there. And do be careful in your usage. A mate used a whole Kohli fist pump a couple years ago and he has never been the same since. Now he sticks to black tar heroin, tears and the odd halal snack pack like the pleb that he is.",11
Tf was that,2
"No matter the total, CSK makes it look like 250",9
CSK overestimates themselves,2
Bruh this is the powerplay,3
Prediction - Dhoni  83* off 36 balls seals the game for csk,6
"Curran has IPL SR of 192, lets get him at the crease",1
"Now Jadhav is gone, who's going to be blamed next? Rayadu?or Watson? /s",-3

CSK aren't out of this still. Dhoni feasts on RCB batting. And we don't know yet how good Jagadeesan is.,-3
Sundar and Natarajan should get a long rope with India. Been outstanding this season,5

RCBoyz start the dance 🕺,6
All cocky RCB fans need to remember RCB is an Indian team and Sam Curran plays for the opposition,12
Jadhav could have made a difference here . This situation is right up his alley,3
Stop slogging. Jeez,1
This is the year dibbly-dobbly spinners. Here we have Sundar and Axar bowling like Warne and Murali,4
And chahal hasnt even started his spell!,6

Here comes Washington in control

This Jagadeesan dude is already looking more confident and comfortable than Gaikwad,13
Shit powerplay for CSK lol,4
Hopefully Jagdeesan does a Paul Valthaty here.,7

I just wanna see washi bowl in pp in sharjah. Even if hes half the good. We should retain him.,8

Another csk loss? Subscribed,5
"MI bois supporting RCB because if RCB get into playoffs, MI will run them over",7

"Lately, as an RCB fan I've been feeling this emotion which is very weird, something I've never felt before. I haven't been able to describe it properly but after some solid research, apparently it's called joy?",43

finch left hanging with that high-five. deserved,9
"Shit.... This is classic kedar situation, should've played a masterclass here",7

Yeah no way in hell CSK can make a come back from this unless Rayudu comes up with a brilliant innings,3

Kohli didn't hi five Finchy. Sad kfc noises 💔🥺,12
Fifth over put pressure on Watson and he perished. CSK couldn’t have possibly started worse,3
That reminded me of Watson's dismissal by Ashwin in WC2011.,3
They left Finch hanging LMAO,11
"On the bright side, it literally can't get any worse for CSK this season.",9
How did Jagadeeshan get into the CSK side? Must have lied on his resume about being a 36 year old.,16
feels like they're not even trying.,5
Yeah CSK is done. Don't see them coming out of this hole.,10
As a rcb fan I'll keep my comments after the match is over. With how the other match happened we can never know,22
"Dc Mi and Kkr fighting for the top, meanwhile Kxip Rr and Csk fighting for the bottom. Competition is heating up 🔥",8
Scene set for a Dhoni masterclass today?,2
CSK : Strike Rates are overrated in T20,12
Should CSK get Rahane in the mid transfer window?,3
"Lmao, ABD has to give Virat extra consolation after every wicket.

Yeah man, we are winning this",9
"If we're gonna shithouse this, I would've preferred the Kedhar Jadhav perfection tbh",6
This is setting up to become another marvellous Thala chase,13
Kheti baadi ka Umar h re csk walo Wo karo ... bachho ko cricket khelne do,2
KKR is on third because of CSK and KXIP shit performance... Wtf,6
when will openers learn that using the first 5 overs to just get settled is the dumbest shit u can do in t20,9
"Mi fans supporting RCB today for whatever reason

Thank you!",11
No one responded to Finch’s hi-five after Watson’s wicket. lmao 😂,10

Rrr over 10 in the 7th over is a good sign right?,7
Dhoni being stitched up by his team... Guess they just want him to retire fully now..,6
Jagadeesan has a Jaffer-esque stance..that press down and spring up,1
"Swanny is a rich white Englishman so I'm going to go ahead and stereotype him as a fag smoking, cricket loving, cokehead

Edit : Very entertaining, is my point",6
on a serious note.. atleast half of CSK will retire next year (i am hoping so) and i don't think they have a main auction.. who will they pick..!?,5
Jagdeesh lads practicing his defence,5
Jaga doesn't have good stats tho,3
"Downvote me as you please CSK fans because that is one thing you can control unlike the fate of your team which is destined to not make the playoffs.

Lol",5
I'm disappointed we don't have the Adamendra Chahalazampa combo today.,6
KXIP will release their entire team next season. So CSK don't need to worry about there not being a mega auction,4
"opening pair trying to get set in powerplay is becoming the norm now,better play one day then bc.",3
"Even for an ODI, this is slow batting",3
CSK released Dhruv Shorey before the last auction. Now they have no middle order replacement.,3
"New batsman, same old story",1
I don't care if Jagdeesan is hitting 6 or not. Its just refreshing to see hitting for once,8
and to think Kohli was barely bowling 2 of Washi’s overs until this season is just mind boggling,2
"Classic start by CSK, they'll easily chase this ............ In 50 overs",11
At what RRR would this be unchaseable for CSK?,1
Required run rate is now above 10. CSK will now play for NRR.,5
Required run rate already close to 11...feels like this is long gone for csk,1
"Required rate is already 10.7

Cant imagine how much higher it would become when our middle order does their masterclass.",11
Batting like thala even before he walks out so that he feels comfortable.,9
If Morris can bat like his heyday then rcb suddenly look a dangerous unit esp with their bowling,8
Dhoni haters have become more vocal than the so called fans they always shit on for being very vocal in their support for dhoni,7
The powerplay has made the game look like a 190+ chase.,4
Why don't CSK understand Powerplays aren't meant for tuk tuk.,13
"If pizza, Reddit shitposting and CSK CHOKEDEEP ain't enough for you guys... remember that Twitter and Google comments exist",6
Csk badly missing raina,6
Why is kohli in a pagdi,6
"When Dhoni was young he wanted youngsters in the national team. When he got old, he started prioritising older players and started giving more weight to the experience lol.",30
I just found out that Bang Bros won this year's U19 world cup. I haven't been following cricket enough this year.,12
CSK should just change their whole team this mid transfer window,11
Rayudu only takes ones.,9
"If Morris comes through, RCB have found their almost optimum XI here. Given how assured he usually looks when batting, Sundar can and should bat at 5; especially if Koach and AB continue at 3 and 4. Dube and Morris (again he needs to come through) are good enough for batting at 6 and 7.

That does leave Gurkeerat out of position and RCB may want to look at Shahbaz Ahmed, the rookie all rounder. As left arm orthodox, he gives them another option as wickets tire.

Finch needs to be given a decent run but in Moeen, they do have a great replacement option if needed. With Saini, Chahal, Udana, Sundar, the bowling looks decent as well with Morris adding some pace.",10
Already above 10 lol,10
"If Washington Sundar scores a double century, he will be called Washingdoubleton Sundar.",10

KP flaming the shit out of CSK batsmen. Fk yeah,7
Swann with the trolling lol,6

Csk playing for nrr already,5
"Koach grooming Washington and Dube to become India’s middle order pinch hitters, who can contribute with the ball. He’s doing the right thing, when KKR, Mumbai, DC, RR are all grooming openers and CSK is grooming retirees",17
Jaga would have run 2 and rayudu still wouldn't have completed the 1st run,5
Finally These Commentators stepping up and critisizing CSK,3
Lmao they’re running like that despite being the only ones who probably don’t have arthritis,3
"This is also an issue with playing against koach on good bowling pitches in T20, he is a freak of nature in stealing  doubles, increasing the total without any flashy shots(not that he doesn't hit those too). And when the other team also struggles with hitting boundaries and they don't have those steady stream of twos, it becomes evident how much valuable those doubles are.

Obviously this is all moot on pitches like sharjah which fucks up all the nuance of the sport rendering it a slogfest.",10
"Oh KP, daddy is just strolling in the park. Stop going after him",2
Quantum of loss already?,2
Sundar has been super impressive. Both RCB spinners might make it to the WC squad for next year,4
"KL Rahul should be traded to CSK mid season, he will fit in well with his strike rates are overrated motto",6
Where’s the commitment??,1
Reckon CSK will retain anyone before the next auction ? Don't think there is anyone worth retaining for that high amount.,1
Geriatric running by Rayadu,1
Rayudu probably dreaming of more pakoda and vada pav when doing the runs,1
Jagdeeshan also to get threats like jadhav. Toxic fans.,4
Rayudu being targeted lol,4
Csk can pack it up for the tournament,6
Sanjay Bangar is from the school of Intent™,3
"Myth buster alert: Dhoni’s captaincy is what makes CSK. 

Truth: Captain is as good as his team.",2
I might as well stop watching this ipl if csk fucks up,4
Refreshing to see that commentators have the balls to criticize CSK.,12
ok that's stunningly shit running by Rayudu.,6

Bangar demanding intent had to be peak comedy.,2
"KP has a point lol. Running fast puts pressure on the fielder which could lead them to misfield. This half assed jogging allows the fielder to take their time.

Not that I am complaining or anything.",13
Seriously csk are now trolling it's fans,6
"Imagine if RCB had such a ground to play since the beginning instead of Chinnaswamy

They're going after Rayudu hard on the commentary,1
They have so much batting depth surely they should put a counter attack rn,2
CSK is done.,6
lmfao so much tuktuk it's painful to watch,7
Jadhav got so mad that he was dropped that he's now possessing all the CSK batsmen,5
Does Kp know everyone isn't Kohli and you get tired real quick in Dubai heat??,3
Do fast back to back overs from spinners give the batsmen less time to get set?,2
Shut up Kp,4

Didn’t realize how bad Rayudu’s running is between the wickets. He’s Ranatunga of CSK.,6

"NRR badhao, NRR bachao.",4
"Feel for Jagadeesan here. Gaikwad was sent in a similar high pressure situation against RR and dropped after just two failed innings. The guy was the second highest run-scorer in the SMA Trophy ffs.

On the other hand, RCB let their 19-year-old opener actually open and gain some confidence playing in the powerplay.  

For all the high praises sung for the CSK management, they have also botched the chances of several Indian youngsters with immense potential. Since Ashwin, there hasn't been a single long term Indian prospect that has come out of the CSK system.",16
Ok it's the pitch and that was just Koach.,2
They playing for NRR already?,-1
CSK is always a champion they can win world test championship /s,3
Zampa was a good replacement but Kane Richardson would've made this RCB lineup so much balanced and good.,-1
Rayudu is more than capable. We need him out,-1
5D Chess from Mumbai Indians to let Rayudu score in the first match to make people forget that he averaged 23 at a SR of 93 last season.,0
Someone remind them that this is a T20 not test,0
"Dhoni bating position poll?? It should have a 7, 8 and 9th option as well",-1
Rayudu is a really good under rated player don’t count him out he can make a big difference in this match,1
Looks like CSK is all set to chase well in the second innings.,0

Are mid season transfers like ahort term loans? Do players return to their original franchises?,2
Another 4 run over and CSK's run rate will be lower than my grades,2
I loved Kohli innings today. Forget the big shots. Man only has **5** dot balls. How awesome is that...,4
Economy of 4.4 is truly pathetic in a chase of 170.,1
Our 3D boy has a lot of intent under his ass than this guy who casually jogs between wickets.,3

"The world has changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now play who remember it. It began with the forging of the Champions League T20 trophy. It was given to Ashwin and McCullum, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 3 IPL trophies to the Dawyne lords, Smith and Bravo of Caribbean halls. And eight, eight finals were gifted to Vijay, who, above all else, desires DK's wife. But they were, all of them, deceived, for their leader was corrupted. In the land of Auld Madras, in the sweaty fires of Chepauk, the Dark Lord Srini Mama forged in secret a master captain, to control all others. And into this captain he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all of the world's cricket. One captain to rule them all.

For this reason I am terminating my contract. 

Yours sincerely,
 
your pal Suresh Raina.",16

Sundar is so much better in PP on these grounds than at the Chinnaswamy with its tiny boundaries.,7
CSK should offer a trade package of Tahir + Hazlewood + Santner for Robin Uthappa. They need him real bad,10

Jagadeesan seems very quick between wickets. It would be interesting to see him and MSD or him and Jadeja bat.,5
Ganguly's shirt is quite top notch,5
Rayudu probably was channelling his inner Dhoni but then remembered he used to play for MI and was scoring for fun against RCB back in the day.,1
Udana looks so dangerous for CSK. Gotta utilise him quick,2
Why are KP and SunnyG so thirsty for running between the wickets. Couple balls back Rayudu smacked it right at the fielder and they're bemoaning the fact that he didn't hustle. The fuck they want him to do? People are dropping like flies because of dehydration and they want that?,5
damn downvoter works fast,2

How can someone downvote so many comments in mere seconds,13
65 million years. Zap,3
I think that if CSK don't lose anymore wickets while batting slowly in the first 20 overs they can really start building their innings from there for the next 20 overs and then they can just go off in the final 10 overs.,7
"""well played again""

Almost hit straight to the fielder and caught 😂😂😂",12

"Surely Sam Curran and Bravo have to come next 

Required run rate is almost 11.5, can Dhoni strike at 200 ?",11

Alright ngl the joy's gone. Anyone else feeling uneasy about what's gonna happen?,7
Someone like Abdul Samad went for base price in the auction. How CSK would have loved that,3

☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭ HUMARA BAJAJ ☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭,5
Dhoni has totally lost it . Even from captaincy point of view. Why would you have inexperienced Curran and Thakur finish their 4 over quota when you have Chahar and Bravo with 1 over left. Easily cost them 20 runs there.,-1
Gotta get that post timeout wicket,2
"Looks like Fleming had a chat with the batsman, gonna see some intent^TM ?",2

"Come on CSK, at least try",3
"After 9 overs 


Rcb 55/1


Csk 44/2",4
Maybe csk has been minsinformed that this is an odi series . Around 16 overs they remember that this is a t20 and start hitting. Rinse and repeat every game . Like memento they r stuck in an infinite loop .,6
I can't see Curran being wasted with the bat,2
Raina major missing for csk,3
Good job by Rayudu and Jagadeesan to see off the new ball. Should have a solid 50 run partnership by the end of the session.,12
"Start the car bhenchods, watching this is like pulling teeth",2
wicket alert. Must have got a pep talk from some coach for sure in that timeout,1
NRR mukhyam Bigile - Dhoni probably,2
Many of those CSK singles looked like doubles,5
It has been confirmed that Covid affects people's hearts. And these people are at danger when their heart rate rises. So CSK makes sure there is no excitement in a match. They doing it to save lives guys.,5
Remind CSK this isn't a test match its a T20,3

Jagadeesan == Jadhav,3
"If RCB plays Moeen instead of Finch, they get so many bowling options.",5

Stick up a picture of 3d boy Shankar on the ball and throw it at Rayudu and then watch him smash the ball all across the park.,4
Finally a 2,2

F@cking shut up about the red car guys. You are in the dugout.,5
"I thought we would miss Chris Morris show as an absolute gun for us, but being able to replace him with the superior batting output of Stoinis and an almost on-par pacer in Nortje has thankfully worked out. Also glad to get rid of Ingram, Jesus christ he was last year's Kedar Jadhav",8
Dube still has not recovered after running the twos,5
"lol, CSK fans have started blaming the toss and how Luck is not on their side. 

BC, Kohli lost so many tosses, still got called shit captain  for all the losses",2
Swann very cheekily over promotes the car. I love it!,4
Jadhav is not playing so whole team is playing like Jadhav,12
I seriously hope Jagadeesan scores some good runs at least for that 3 years wait for this opportunity,5
"Listening to Mark Nicholas in the IPL trying to wax lyrical over ugly hacks across the line is just wrong

Let's be honest like cred awards 'handsomely' this car matches RCB is definitely scripted if they are repeating that over and over again.,4
"Dhoni is truly visionary. He studied the way jadhav builds his innings and hence came up with the line ""aapko kya laga India mai ek hi Dhoni hai"".",7
Lmao the person downvoting is REAL MAD,4
csk games are fucking boring but at least the match threads are lit,5
Usually Strategic timeout ruins the batting team's momentum. But it makes no difference for CSK,6
This could've been a 2 too. WTF!?,7
"Abhi bhi time hai, Raina ko balcony suite de do",11
There’s no way CSK can chase this with 5 overs of Chahal and Sundar left. I’ll delete my account if CSK wins,12

Jagdeesan has an avg of 23 and SR of 112 in domestic T20s,12
Okay boys the match is done,4
"To be fair, you have to have a very high pain tolerance to be a fan of CSK. The pain inflicted by the players on their fans is extremely slow, and without a solid grasp sadism, most  viewers will turn off their TV. There's also middle order's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Ted Bundy, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the mental capacity to truly accept the pain, to realise that they're not just unbearable- they say something deep about DEATH.",14
Csk batting is so clueless,8
"How long did I sleep? 

Did the IPL rules change?? Does the chasers now get 30 overs to chase or what?? 

Come-on PUSH .. CSK.. PUSH!!!",13
Bc its the same story with almost every game with CSK,10
"I can understand teams like MI and KKR, who have firepower down the order, take chases deep because they can chase 11 an over for 10 overs. But why the fuck do CSK keep doing that?",7
Both Jagadeesan and Rayudu take off their masks to reveal they were Kedar all along.,15
I think [serial downvoter](http://u/me) is back .,5

Haha dugout has turned cricket into live betting with their wicket alert shit.,8
I hate being a CSK fan in 2020. Was looking forward to ipl after a sad year.,6

Ganguly has come to the match to fne CSK for single handedly reducing the interest in ipl,5
Who'll be the scapegoat today?,6
This chennai team reminds me of the Test team RCB assembled in 2008.,5
The RCB lineup is now pretty decent. Just switch Finchy with Philippe/Moeen and they're pretty set. I'd play that lineup for 4-5 consecutive games barring no injuries.,4
Can we have kedar back if jagdesan cant bat...atleast he played proper test cricket not swing and miss test cricket,5

Stealing, and replacing with a clever replica, the forearms and genitals of Sanath Jayasuriya. The forearms were to be studied at the Department of Exotic Materials, University of Melbourne while the genitals would be taken to the Royal Melbourne hospital.

Disaster struck when the extraction team were held up at Colombo airport owing to their overall dodginess and lack of melanin. The extraction team in their infinite wisdom had decided to go full Paul Hogan and showed up in khaki shorts sporting handlebar moustaches and 3 machetes between them. The forearms and genitals never made their way downunder and the extraction team was completely disavowed by the Australian government. It remains one of the great political/diplomatic faux pas by the John Howard government. It's a shame the smarmy cunt got away with it. Our thoughts remain with the wronged extraction team. Join me in honoring their memory at your local kebab shop.",3

Csk is going to be like Man united after Fergie left.,1
"Ok guys, say me good luck i'mma bout to turn into serial downvoter (;",-12
56 in 11 overs. Yes it's a T20 score. Yes they are chasing 170. Yes you read it right.,6
"CSK have been like those asshole kids who begin reading Digest books just a couple days before Board Exams. They'd scrape through only coz the Qs would match what they'd studied. This season, they got a proper whooping by the others who have Byjus",7

Why is Saini bowling his 3rd now,4
Jagdeesan not following the plan with that boundary,7
"I have COVID. As a CSK fan, I can't take this stress. Baadu Pasanga.",5
Legit question to csk batsmen. Is it that hard to play with RR > 6 for the first 6-8 overs? Ffs.,5
"Man.. what happened to Rayudu? Was a fan of his battling from 2 seasons ago. 

I thought he's the best of the lot to hit out for CSK. And he's playing so slow like... every other CSK player.. 

I'm starting to wonder if they are planning a revenge on someone in the management!!!",4

Pepperidge farm remembers.",3

I swear Rayudu uses the same shot to get out of jail lol,1
Beamer incoming,0
You should not go too deep... It will hurt CSK,0
Nobody with a 100 SR yet. This is so awful to watch,2
They should look to accelerate a bit now that the 10 over power play is over,2
Rayudu is so bad at rotating the strike,3
"this is so bad that im starting to feel bad for csk fans. believe me, that's a tough bridge to cross for a mi supporter.",4
Are these guys procrastinating? I know a thing or two about that. Never ends well,8

I can’t stand the regular commentators even for the 2 minutes of coaching interviews.,-1
Ah so there is a serial downvoter in here. Wonder how much do you have to suck in life to downvote everyone in a Reddit thread lol.,8

Get on with it Rayudu ffs,4
How sad must your life be to downvote every comment? Go get a life.,11
"Dhoni hiding eh ?
Like always...",-11
People comparing Jagdeesan to Jadhav need to be a little less judgemental. Jagdeesan might pull off a Tewatia tonight who knows. The guy is playing his first game let him take his time.,10
I feel this is the way to go about in this wicket the bowlers are always in the game and can trigger a massive collapse if you’re careless so you need to keep your wicket and take it deep. The odd boundary every 2 overs is required but if you take it deep enough one 20 run over and you’re back in.,-2
This is really painful to watch.,7
"Not a Sunny G fan, but this is the problem with CSK. So fucking static. A four and then lazy dots",3

Terrible day for rain,-1
Rayudu plays like a tailender against genuine fast bowlers,3
There have been four instances now in IPL2020 when a side has failed to reach even 50 at the half-way stage (10 overs). Chennai Super Kings have done so thrice alone.,6
Such a contrasting match this. RCB Makes everything exciting and fun. CSK on the other hand are experts in something else entirely,5
"Curran, Bravo should be the next ones in.",-2
Pathetic seeing these guys struggle when we have so many hitters waiting,-1
I was told this was a T20 tournament,4
Why is voice echoing. Do player also hear that interview? That is pretty weird,-4
"Tbh, csk playing physically hurts to watch",1
"r/cricket, rank the teams in terms of entertainment value. All I know is CSK are dead last",8
"So the plan would be - these guys bat till 16overs, then Bravo comes in and smashes 80 in last 4. Is this correct?",7
"*Virat Kohli hits a six*

"Damn, these CSK fans are actually mad at random people on the internet. CSK very good, all players very nice, Dhoni very good, retired players very good, management very good, random people on internet bad.",9
Jagadeesan did better than anything jadhav could've done,4
Csk has a huge fan base and their owner is a huge thanos fan. Before the season they decide to kill half of the fans but they wanted to show it as accidental deaths so thala came up with a super whistle phodu idea to bat slow bat deep take the game down and then lose it closely this will cause hugh frustration among the fans and slowly slowly they'll die off.,5
Rayudu can't run a 2 🤦🏾‍♂️,11
[deleted],4
Jaga finally showing intent. But don't be too hard on him.,3
This guy is an opener for TN isn't he? Should be opening for csk as well. First match but looks really good,3
so by far this ipl stoinis > Russell,4
CSK rule: for every boundary you have to waste 3 balls.,7
Is CSK the new RCB? Or is that RR?,3
Strike rate of 100 VOWWWW GRAPEEEE!!!,5
That's a Dhoniesque leave from Rayudu,7
Well left Rayadu! That had some turn on it.,13
CSK are gonna win this. Heard this first here!,8
Just swing the fucking bat FFS. Either get out or whack the ball.,9

Kohli is very good in group stage big games... The playoffs idk.,2
Lost hope in this match. Just watching to see Jagadeesan play.,6

There is no point in batting deep if you are not gonna take any risks and take the game deep,4

Why in the goddamn fuck did CSK roll with Jadhav all these days instead of this young man?,5

 no  Adamendra Chahalazampa no party,4
Watson looks miserable,10

Should've taken Jaggi from the start. Terrible captaincy this season,9
CSK should have petitioned to have their matches scheduled in the day. It's tough on these seniors to stay focussed after 8pm.,10

Its like they have already decided before the tournament that they don't have the team to win it with the loss of Raina and Bhajji. So they are just aiming to not be at the bottom of the table.

Dube now when they wanna hit a 20 run over is bad captaincy..,3
"Can't wait till IPL is back in India. Won't be next year, will we have to suffer through another season in UAE?",4
This is what happens when you get local lads into the side,3
Why the fuck would you give Dube an over here. All the bowlers are bowling well.,8
Thanks for the favour kohli,3
To be honest I just want to see someone other than CSK or MI win this IPL,5
Shivam has a headband today. Can't blame him,4
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.,2
The momentum seems to be shifting.,2
Make most of the runs in this over.,2
I can feel it. The vibes. The RCB defense vibes. Coming back at me like a storm.,3
Why is it that headband bowlers always serve pies,7
"Csk should trade someone off for Rahane from Delhi, would help in the middle order and Delhi doesn't look like they're gonna use him anyway",1
Yeaa we're gonna lose this one... Hope Sharjah comes good for us...,3
Should've showed this intent from the beginning.,2
Ambati tirupati rayudu . SAY THE NAME!!!,1
Some nice KFC™ zinger burger© buzzers from Finchy there,7
Why Dube is bowling when all 5 bowlers are doing good,2
How tf is Deepak lower than Padikkal for the points,1
AB should be counted as a local player in RCB team by now.,5
"CSK has never batted first this season.

Is this why our ""youngsters"" are too tired to score run a ball?",6
"They are so worried about NRR, they forgot they should also win.",3
dubey le doobe?,1
Wasted.,1
It should be Bravo or Curran in next,2
Why is Dube bowling? They already have 5 good bowlers,1
Keep running those 2s boys!,5
CSK have mastered Test20,2
"Jaggi ?  thought Jaga was common short name for Jagadeesan, just like Nattu for Natarajan.",3
Jagdeesan is indian Ross taylor,3
"I thought CSK is slow, but now I see RCB was just a little behind CSK at the end of 14 overs - Okay then.",6
don’t give me hope,4
Why does it look like Dube's slipping everytime he bowls,4
Abeyy inko khana khilao koi...Bc pullshot 30 yards mei gir jaata h saalo ka,6
"Koach: We can defend 90 off 7 overs right?

Bowlers: Well yes, but actually no.",6
'Intent as KP would say' lol who was that?,2
"Wow, Jagadeesan actually trying. CSK gonna drop him for the lack of lack of intent",7
Jagadeesan didn't get the memo of tAkInG iT deEp,2
"Easy two, good over. RCB were at 83-3, so clearly csk has edge over rcb . /s",1
Finally some intent. Dube disappointing with bowling as usual,7
Jagadeesan’s shots are so clean man,5
The slope for RCB begins from here. It goes only downwards now,4
Dube shouldn't have been given a over. Should have brought on Sundar,3
"Guys I have a weird conspiracy theory. I think this match is fixed. Here me out.

Think its a 4D chess move by CSK. They dont want ONLY Dhoni to look bad due to poor batting performance (slow run rate initially). The CSK marketing team thought its better to get the top CSK batting order suffer too to make the villan the entire team rather than just Dhoni. That ways Dhoni's image remains intact. As at this point saving brand is more than winning IPL.

1 like = 1 disagree.",2
Someone’s been in KP’s ear to tell him to try and pretend this game isn’t dead,4
Rattled by the batsman moving. 3rd rate bowler.,2
Tamil commentary comparing with RCB innings and saying its equal. Bc they had Kohli blasting off in last 5.,4
[deleted],1
Wtf was that ball,2
Dhoni should have given jagadeesan a chance much earlier !!,3
Chahal and Sundar have one over left. Why the fuck is Kohli not bowling them? Even their bad over will be better than Dube's good one. Ffs braindead.,0
Jagadeesan could be the X factor csk looking for,5
Let Jagadishan open ffs,3
now that's more like it Rayudu,0
Why isn't anyone talking about this shit move by koach?,6
"Time to be a serial upvoter, I gotchyo back bois",3
Not a single six this innings. Seems weird.,5
[deleted],2
82 off 37 has already been done more than once this ipl. Don't get over confident boys.,1
"After 14 overs

RCB 86/3

CSK 89/2",7
Jadhav can get fucked,2
What would you bowl Dube. Just finish the spinners’ overs,1
Jagadeesan feels like the perfect Badrinath replacement in the CSK setup.,5
"Strange move getting in a Dube over now. Front line bowlers are doing well and RRR is 14 against CSK in 2020.

Do you really need a sixth bowler today?",7
Ha!! I've seen this one before,2
Dube wants to be so much like Stokes that he's also bowling like him,2
Shivam Dube has such a confused fucking face. It's like even he doesn't have a fucking clue about how he ended up here.,4
Halfway to the score in just 13.4 overs. Gotta take it easy.,2
"Why the fuck is dube asked to bowl

The main bowlers have like a total of 7 overs left",4
RCB need a wicket badly.,4
A 50 for Jaga here would do wonders for him,3
"Kohli's Dube move after time out, backfired.",6
"CSK openers and upper middle order play way too cautiously and waste too many balls and then get out without scoring anything. 

The middle order and upper lower order don't have enough balls to set in, build partnerships and still chase the target.",2
CSK are ahead of where RCB were. But they don't have anyone who could do what Kohli did could they? Curran maybe?,8
Jagdesan should wear END JADHAV on his jersey because that is what he is doing.,8
"Moment of truth.

I have seen RCB lose from here too many times. Don't fuck it up plzz.",18
Sundar could have bowled this over. Why was Dube even required?,6
This is not part of the script guys,5
Only way CSK is winning if Umesh invades the ground and bowls all the remaining overs.,9
trying to pull off a Gambhir eh?,5
Jagga pelega aaj,6
Alia is cute af lol,6
"Tbf both of the batsmen played a good innings 

Wait this isn't an ODI match",8
What is the need for bowling Dube? Everyone was bowling fine.,9
80 in 6 overs isn't a big deal with 8 wicket in hands,6
"They never should have let the RRR get above 12

Where was this intent 6 overs ago",12
Enough now you can please fuck off dube,7
[deleted],2
"Do we win, if it rains in Dubai now?",2
"Fuck it our seasons over. Just play Gaikwad, Jagadeesan and let em develop. Give Santner a chance",5
Jadhav's IPL carrer is over for sure.,12
CSK ahead of RCB at this stage,2
"As a Black Caps fan in the 90s, I'm not sure why I identify with the chase CSK is making.",3
"Rayudu 30(30)

This is like Kedar Lite Pro",6
We are losing this most probably,5
So moreis and udana for last,3
Just see SAINI out take singles don’t lose the wicket,3
Curran Classic I reckon.,3
Saini deserves a wicket here... Terrific spell,2
Both CSK and RCB need a wicket badly to stay in the match.,6
FFS Kohli should have saved Saini for death overs,3
We need a shitload of sixes,4
That super over boundary against Bumrah was the trigger point for Koach.,5
Yenna da adhu,3
"Csk finally going ahead of RCB in the 14th over.

After 14th over 

Rcb 86/3

Csk 89/2.",5
Should have saved one Saini over for Dhoni/Curran/Bravo imo,4
"33\* (27) SR 122.22

Kedar Jadhav's replacement. 

Just saying.

Edit: Jinxed it. Sorry.",9
Wtf was that lol,6
What the fuck,6
Noice.,3
Oh man. That was very lazy from Jagadeesan,6
Wtf was that mate. Poor cricket from Jagdeesan,7
MS come out now,4
"Hindi commentry be like 
1. Nehraji - Bowl good / back of lenght 🤦🤦🤦
2. Pathan - The pitch is tough to score for a new batsman take some time ( even though RRR climbs 20 ) 🤷‍♂️🤷🏻
3. Sapru - Suck up to either Kohli, Dhoni or Rohit",9
"Lmao

Sees Dhoni 

Oh shit",9
That’s some lazy ass running.,7
Morris is the MVP,5
Hahaha he literally just said “kill me I’m already dead”,9
CSK oughta play Saini out,4
One bad game and Kohli has already lost faith in Saini's death bowling? The guy won you the game with his super over against Pollard and Pandya ffs.,7
Uptown girl in 2020. This dj lmao,4
"Dude, why can't you put bat inside the crease. You were there. WTF. Basics BC",4
"Wtf was that run? Dude just walked? Intentional run out? Seriously, wtf?",9
"when even the youngest players are running like other 40 year olds on the team. Damn, the effect",10
bhenchod,4
"Imagine how bad the team is to call someone playing at a strike rate of 110 an ""X factor""",10
Is Jagadeeshan doing it on purpose? Even during the last over,4
What was that lol,4
Oh no :(,4
Slow lazy running,4
Lol with this score and match situation that's a terrible way to get out.,6
"Sucide?

Sucide reported",6
What a way to get dismissed lmaoo,3
Amit Mishra got a strong competitor now,4
Morris u beauty.,4
Nazar ghati durghatna ghati,4
RCB slowly handing over control of the game,3
"Woah, today seems to be a bad day to run slow....",7
Man.. Now Curran will come and take this game away,5
"14/19 dot balls now, that's ridiculous",3
Huh,4
"Jaggi, you clown",2
The commentary is cringe,2
Wtf,3
KL has corrupted so many Indian batsman.. no one wants to play freely.. look at rayadu.. 30 in 30 when you need 170...,4
Koach orgasmed at that direct hit.,9
Garbage run out but not so bad considering the sitch.,9
"Jeez, Jagadeeshan didn't expect a direct hit and slowed
Down",6
Casual as fuck running. Bad.,6
So casual. Should have dive,5
WTF was that!,3
I think he saw saini moving and decelerated,5
"Why not even try to ground, wtf?",4
What in the cinnamon toast fuck is that,3
After the wicket Chennai’s chances have improved,1
Oh FFS just sitting back to watch a nice close finish and wtf,1
WHAT THE FUCK BRO? BASICS?,1
What lazy running was that man?,2
Common Dhoni you can do it.,3
"Lmaooo

Curran next or forget it",4
Lmao not even trying. Top kek,5
wtf was he thinking. expected that from Rayudu.,2
He wanted to get out,5
Thats just poor running,3
"LMAO, Unacademy learning moment right there kids. Always ground your bat..",7
Jagadeesan... No... He looked so promising,4
Such a pedestrian way to get out.,7
Boi No intent at all,5
Dekho vo aa gaye,3
Wtf was that,2
It was like he wanted to be out,4
"**14.2** Saini to Jagadeesan, OUT,  **89-3**

N Jagadeesan run out (Morris) 33 (28b 4x4 0x6) SR: 117.85",2
Did he throw his wicket away?,3
No Jaggi :(,2
That was just bad running. Fleming must be livid.,3
MS is coming out,2
"Lazy running all through, this was waiting to  happen",10
pathetic running. how can you run in so lazily?! wtf wtfff WTFFF,8
Did he intentionally get out there?,7
thats some retarded running,7
Oh Dhoni is out.,2
Wtf that was some casual running at the end,4
[dHoNI dOEs nOT cArE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j8jetr/match_thread_25th_match_chennai_super_kings_v/g8c8yho/?context=10000),3
Gg RCB,2
69 rr coming soon,3
Rayudu is showing what brotherhood is ... Missing Jadhav,3
he was literally WALKING,6
"OK terrible finish from Jagadeesan, but decent innings for an IPL debut. Hope CSK stick with him.",6
"Em ra Jagadeeshu, emi aa lagetthudu?",8
MS,3
Saini please don't bowl a beamer to dhoni,3
He got intentionally out.,5
"Not running quick enough?

 Is he flash? Stupid single.",9
Dhoni be like I can't chase with RRR 15 and top order is just doing that,4
"Here we go, does Dhoni get clowned even further or does he shut everyone up",4
"I like how RR and kingsXI give more chances to youngsters.

Yes they don't have the best XI in the IPL.
But, giving chances to young player is. Indication of the team management.

CSK have early failed in this aspect.",3
Guys eli5 how is Saini and Archer bowling at 140 s and the batsman just struggles but aron or bumrah bowls at 150s but batsman just play one of the most beautiful cover drives???,5
Why the fuck is saini bowling now?? Isn't he good at death,7
Now watch Dhoni take 6 balls to warm up.,8
Yeah so that was a fucking sad thing to see,5
Why Dhoni and not currAn,7
They needed Sammy Curran ffs,9
"Who is this salty csk fan 
Downvoting all comments",7
Probably learnt running from WhitehatJr,12
Lol wtf was that by Jagadeesan,10
this is MS's chance to play that one  match winning season innings,3
Just here to see Sam Smack a few sixes and get out at this point,6
Lack of intent,8
Give me Scurran or give me death,7
Please be tuk tuk Dhoni,7
Thalas here rcb won the game,5
Come on thala!,1
"With all due respect to KP as a player, his commentary makes me want to punch a fucking wall",4
Jaga man you were playing so well:(,8
Everyone has a different style of playing they don’t need to run around like Bolt to score KP is getting annoying wanting every batsmen to be Kohli,6
My god that was some genuinely dreadful running between the wickets.,5
"dhoni is here, you guys can now start criticing him because he is 0/0 currently xd",2
[deleted],9
Thala is on,2
Gg bois,5
"well played, maybe 10 more would have helped but given who he replaced, not bad.",7
om jai jagadeesan haraye,3
Should have sent Curran,5
MS of CSK vs RCB 2019 plizz.,3
Oh I thought it would be sam? Why MS?,3
81 from 34 and dhoni against rcb.... Fuck!,3
Will be interesting which Dhoni we'll see today,2
I think he saw the throw was accurate.,1
"Guys, we've been waiting for this all day, let's get ready to take a huge dump on Dhoni again",2
"If you want to be taken seriously at an international level, you need to show more fucking intent. That was a jog in the park.",2
5D chess from Jaggu to have a low SR so that he plays the next match,1
"Beautiful shot, good placement rayudu",1
Grab your popcorn boys..this thread is going to go,2
Bad running.,1
YEAH BigBicepsBoy is here,3
Now it begins,2
Can I get a slowni plz,4
Sam Curran or Bravo would have been better,5
The greatest finisher is here /s,5
Dhoni?? LOL. He didn't learn his lesson from that KKR game. Send Curran ffs!,7
"bowl shit,  direct hit",3
Oh lord not Dhoni. Not now,5
"So, is this the game dhoni gets into form and fuck us?",3
Virat clapping our of pity,3
csk supporters on zoom are all r/deadeyes material rn,4
KP can be annoying sometimes but he make some good points,7
Very easy guys. Dhoni gets 12 in the next four overs and then tries to look like a big hitter. He is a banker boy for RCB,3
Thala Dhoni last over six and lose by 50 runs incoming,5
77 from 33. I think we have seen this before. Lol,5
"if we’re gonna lose, can i at least watch curran bat",6
I am relieved that Dhoni is in and not Curran,6
"Run out after wasting a full toss, and the next man is Dhoni. I sympathize with CSK fans.",1
"How many is MS getting in his first ten balls lads??

I’m saying 7",1
"Fuck you KP. Had he dived or run faster, he would have injired Saini. Fuck you and your intent. No wonder you got dropped.",1
Why are we even watching? This is over. Same shit every match.,3
Dafuq... Dhoni??? Seriously?? This team doesn't even want to win games. Send Curran FFS,10
Mahendra Singh Anxiety is here and I'm already sweating,3
"Nothing like slowing down when getting close to your end, to allow fielder time to hit thr wicket.",1
Dhoni giving Rayudu a telling off for taking risk,1
Csk should play Jagadeeshan for at least 5  more matches instead of Jadhav .Decent outing here under pressure.,5
Hope MSK Prasad and Koach are watching with their 3D glasses on. Hope Rayudu shows some 3d batting to them.,0
Not a wide. Omg,7
THAT WAS SO NOT A WIDE WT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK,3
Scores leveled,1
Rcb you got this. It's Dhoni in and not Curran or bravo,2
Dhoni lit some fire in raydus pant,2
Bhenchod Umpire,1
Umpire is a CSK fan,6
"Be ready for down votes, if you mention anything negative on the Thala....

CSK Fan boys are already it seems...",8
Dhoni looks like Dube but not as good looking,3
"RCB were 93-4 csk 93-3, csk in better position. /s",4
Fuck umpire,3
He was running like he already hit the winning runs for a boundary.,1
Rayudu is the best hope for CSK,1
Braindead retarded umpiring.,3
KP ffs stop comparing everything and everyone with Kohli. It's not necessary to mention Kohli everytime you say something or criticise any other player.,2
That wasn't a wide.,2
Fuck off umpire.,2
Anil Chaudhary you fucking wanker. That is not a wide.,2
What a retarded Umpire,1
Umpire rooting for csk,2
If they're so mad just take DRS for the wide smh,3
God that's harsh,2
UMPIRE FIXED. CSK PAID OFF UMPIRE,2
"I want to know who the KKR fans be supporting for this game, I can't support rcb but I also want my team to win..",3
"Abhishek Nayar on Dugout, trying to supress to share what exactly is wrong with CSK. ""They only have to go one way"" it seems",3
"I think gill and jagadeeshan today were basically told/forced/wanted to get out.
The situation required them to get out basically. 
Retiring hurt them would be outrageous for the spirit of cricket brigade.",7
Who is the salty CSK fan downvoting eh?,2
Arrey BC wtf not a wide!,3
"Jagadeeshan was like ""fuck this team, i better play for a team with intent""",5
That's not a wide come on,5
*bhen ke lode intensifies*,1
Wasn’t wide,3
Wow guys MS with that infinite strike rate 0(0) 😍,5
da fook dhoni coming in now? more tuk tuk.,3
That’s a terrible terrible call,1
Dhoni ahead of Sam Curran ROFL,3
"The wide calls in this IPL have been, well, a bit shocking to say the least. This was short and inside the tramline",7
Fuck Thala for playing at an indeterminate strike rate /s,2
What the fuck. How it that a wide. Bought twat.,3
One side umpiring^(TM),2
Imagine if we could review wide calls,3
"If CSK could run like Virat, match is theirs, and we all know the answer to that.",2
"That was inside the line, fuck off",4
"People complaining on the line wide, BRUH we got banned for 2 years, realise now?",2
Dhenier is here so expect csk to finish on 149,7
SSDD,1
That was unfair call on wide.,3
Wide?! Are you kidding me?,5
Wasn't a wide. Pathetic umpiring.,7
"77 needed from 33. This is a position RCB have been familiar with, over the years",5
"Rcb pls don't bring dhoni to form please 🙏🙏🙏

We've already brought pollard, Kishan, Mavi, nagarkoti, Rahul, bishnoi, stoinis and many others but please not dhoni",4
Watching Thala don't give a shit used to be fun. Not anymore :(,4
"Seriously though, I don’t get what’s the point of having Sam Curran on the team when you’re not going to send him in when the situation is literally TAILORED for him to excel? 

Waste of an overseas slot imo, may as well play Hazlewood or Tahir",10
That one was harsh,4
What’s the point of fair play award when everyone seems to be getting 10/10 every game,3
Tuk tuk,5
That wasn't wide,4
"Curran has the highest strike rate among any batsmen in the first 10 balls 

Required RR 15

CSK : let's send Dhoni in.",11
We're the same as RCB were but there is still no hope for CSK against RCB. Wtf kind of year 2020 is turning out to be.,2
Indian umpires shit as always,6
Umpire trying his best to make the match even,4
Ambati seems shit at handling short balls.,5
Lappebaazi,1
This empire always makes weird and incorrect decisions I have eyed him out and remember him from previous IPLs,3
saini should bowl Yorker now,2
wtf how was that a wide.,1
Oof that's a dodgy wide,4
"Do the commentators get extra pay to praise dhoni

How can irfan pathan slam dhoni on twitter and keep repeating unhoni honi shit on air",10
honestly the way batsmen are showing the wicket I just want one dismissal via a yorker,3
Rayudu useless,5
Dhenier redemption arc?,2
CSK is batting like Pandya and Pollard yet to come,11
"Player|Mat|Inns|NO|Runs|HS|Ave|BF|SR|
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
KM Jadhav|6|4|1|58|26|19.33|59|98.30|
N Jagadeesan|1|1|1|33|33|33|28|117.85|
M Vijay|3|3|0|32|21|10.66|43|74.41|
RD Gaikwad|2|2|0|5|5|2.50|11|45.45|",6
Rayudu needs to piss off,4
"Feeling bad for Jadhav tbh 

Imagine playing the last balls of your career and you play only dots 

Should have at least hit a six",4
Rayudu . Nice man immediately understand it's MS at the other end and we have to accelerate right now.,2
Wide??? What's the umpire smoking?,6
"Dhoni is here to ease the pressure off RCB, don't worry RCB fans.",2
I'd like to express disappointment on umpiring but I drink beer too. I kind of remember that Umpire drank a lot,2
C'mon KP. Umpires have been shit this IPL,3
Rayadu gonna hit the air particles over the boundary,4
"Dhoni is like that old uncle who wants the glory of yester-year, so he keep screwing his team over by trying to bat for glory",5
I don't think csk wants to win.,6
Morris did Jagadeesan a favour,4
CSK are currently neck for neck with RCB in terms or runs scored,1
"WHY TF DONT YOU PUT CURRAN OR BRAVO IN. 

ITS NOT A TEST MATCH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROTECT WICKETS.

I would rather get bowled out than watch this. I'm pretty sure Im watching the IPL for a T20, not a test match.",10
I need CSKA (CSK Anonymous) support group to cry with fellow mates,6
Lol inexplicably gave up. The whole team gives up lol.,3
Why Rayadu wants to come forward to play each shot?,3
He threw his wicket there.. no way around it,7
true csk fans aren’t sweating bc they know how this match will end,9
"Can someone prepare a nice visualization for an interesting stat I just though about?

Number of times during the IPL 

(1) Dhoni won the toss and elected to field in IPL; and

 (2) Dhoni lost the loss and was made to field. Split by years.

Is it even possible to pull this from some data source easily?",3
Tik tok >>tuk tuk,6
Rayudu is so fucking shit,8
Kohli be like i knew this that is why i selected vijay shankar for no #4.,5
Short ball Dhiener,1
"Watch Dhoni take couple of overs to settle in, hit 3 sixes in last over and lose by 10 runs.",9
Another gem by Anjum: *Rayudu is a fluent striker of the ball. He's also struggling with his timing.*,7
poor turnout,3
"Rayudu walking down the pitch against Saini is peak ""Muh se mungfali nahi tut rahi, gaand se akrot todenge.""",6
Why don't these idiots just promote Curran!!,8
So Kohlis given up on sainis death bowling skills?,5
I thought it was dhoni on strike hitting his first ball for 4 and almost shat my pants,12
"Just how many times has Rayadu run down the wicket, swung, and missed.",12
Rayudu playing like he never set the bowling machine to above 130 clicks,5
"Curran, Jadeja, Bravo

All useless when the middle order is just gonna slog a run a ball for the rest of the game

Better off bringing in bowlers if you aren’t gonna let ppl like bravo abt anyway",9
If the rumours are true and there is no mega auction then csk is fucked next season.,9
Rayudu with that amazing strike rate is making a strong case of comeback to the test team,8
Oh no,2
CSK has hit 0 sixes so far.,12
1(1) * Looking good,10
A miracle. Dhoni getting single first ball,6
Rayudu is complete pony,3
Gwarn Dhoni lad,3
didn't even try wtf,2
Fuck Saini has bowled like a champ,5
that was crispy backfoot punch,3
Csk batting just doesn’t get going,3
"Farming the strike big boz biz 
MS is in town.",4
Rayudu literally doesn't respect the bowler. He attacks the good balls and takes a dot on the bad ones. Plays so many pre-meditated shots.,6
Anjum stfu pls,8
"Strike Rate is just a number, says Anjum Crapra.",10
"Required Run Rate nearly 14 - Check

15 overs completed - Check

Thalla tuk tuk mode activated",12
Length ball. Boooooooo.,4
"Ok, not being sarcastic here, but today is gonna be a rare Dhoni demolition day. 

No tucking way we should lose to rcb.",-3
Omg no. I owe all you guys 5 Bucks,4
"Saini has bowled out, I am a bit concerned now.",3
Interesting move from Kohli to finish off Saini's spell so early.,2
"This is so weird, they don't seem to want to win lol",2
"""Dhoni is getting better everyday, every match in this dream 11 IPL"".....what is this woman in the comm smoking?",9
"“Dhoni is getting better every innings, every outing this Dream11 IPL”

hahaha is it possible to mute commentators who have no clue what they’re talking about. God, they should go back to wiping Dhoni jizz out of their mouth rather than talking too much",7
"The lady said Strikerate is just a number lmaoo yes, an important number",12
"Thala comes in when RR is 14+
Seems about right",5
Single of the first ball?!,0
"Dhoni 100 SR. 

Not good enough.",4
"Commentator: So many matches 

Also commentator: Strike rate is just a number",3
Why on earth did Jagadeesan not dive?,2
Lmao Brett Lee,1
Soo Dhoni's keeping the strike uh,0
can’t wait for the classic 19th over bat change from dhoni after the game is over,9
"Who would you choose

1. Dhoni who is past his form rn

2. Curran who batted really good in initial matches for CSK",3
Dhoni actually has an IPL average of 40+. That puts him in the same bracket as Gayle Warner and ABD,0
74 off 30 is a par target to chase down in IPL. We need more wickets 🙏,8

"I missed the first innings, from 95 how did they get to 170 in 5 overs",3
The actors are good in dream 11 ads,2
"All Right RCB boys. Dhoni is here, key to win this game is don't get him out.",5
Two over without a boundary guys🙏🙏,2
Why would you want an autograph on your trimmer?,9
"Has Dhoni just had a trim. Looks like my Dad when he went through his midlife crisis

Except he’s an Indian cricketer, and my Dad is a white British accountant",2
4-18-0 Brilliant from Saini.,3
Hussey would still run better than these guys.,6
"Saini was bowled out to try and kill the game early, not because Virat lost faith in him",3
RCB are bowling  Morris and Udana at the death.,3
Rayudu needs to go and Curran or Bravo or someone who can run with MS needs to pull off something like what Kohli did,1
Just 15 an over required. See us get 60+ of the 74 required without ever looking like we will win.,1
Required Run rate and age are just a number for Dhoni.,3
"It’s still not time to rush. Let it be 40 out of 12 balls, then hit 3 sixes, get out and get admired for staying there and making the game a close call. BS",3
Dhoni strike rate 100.00 where are the haters now,6
Will not saving Saini another over hurt us in the end? I seriously hope not,2
Will CSK finally chase this down after fucking around for fifteen overs Part 5,3
This white hat junior ad is the weirdest shit I have ever seen. Are millennial Indian parents even like this?,3
CSK hasn't even hit a single 6 this match.,3
There are like 20 different Dhoni ads.,4
Good god Anjum. That was some hype job for Dhoni,8
"Last year Dhoni won matches from these situations, or at least got CSK close and everyone thought He was back. He is not too old guys, just out of form.",5
"Dhoni alone Infuriated me enough while playing for India because he gave up.

Imagine a whole team playing like that. That would kill me lol.",3
"as someone supporting bangalore this match thala's presence gives me comfort, truly sad how the mighty have fallen",5
Curran has a strike rate of 226 this year yet he's not even batting,4
"Ugh, it's the same fucking script for every CSK match.

Bowl well until 15th over, then concede a fuck ton of runs in the last 5.

Keep up with the opponent's score but still feel like you've lost the game before the 10th over even when you're only around 10 runs short.",4
Send Curran in at 4 and you might've stood a chance,5
Haha I can change my flair and nobody will realize I supported RR until yesterday,4
Nearly 15 required,2
RCB scored 76 off the last 5. CSK need 74.,4
"Pitchforks at discounted rates. Stocks will run out SOON. Hurry!

⎯⎯∈

↻(*｀ー´)ψ",2
People complaining about Rayudu not playing pace should remember that he has always had issues with good pace. He has been in trouble when the ball is in the 138+ range.,2
"*He gets better with every innings*

Ehh what? Has that ass-licking commentator even seen his last few innings?",4
Seems like the Jadhav-virus has infiltrated the CSK camp.,2
[deleted],-3
"Come on CSK, do not give us a heart attack. 

Hit 3 sixes when there is 27 required off 3 balls, we get the points, you limit the NRR damage, everyone goes home happy.",3
[deleted],-3
"Predict the req RR after the end of 17th over.

My prediction is 18",5
Commentators orgasming over Dhenier,11
KP just jinxing MS full on.,9
Okay gays I have a theory..... Plzzzz listen. tHalA came late to bAt so he bat deeeeep and hit last ball for six. Win or lose hitting last ball for six increases NRR. Its not about points itzzz about #NRR . biG bRainnn. So keep kALm and support Dhoni!!!! 😎😎😎,6
"KP stop, you’re embarrassing yourself",9
KP jinxing Dhoni Lol,6
"Thank god for the dugout commentary, I don't think I can take the Dhoni dick-riding that is going to happen on normal commentary",3
Dhoni got a transplant,6
MAGICIAN,2
Dhoni masterclass from 23(27) to 45(35) after ensuring that the RRR is out of reach,2
Did Dhoni get hair transplant?,4
Commentators should stop sucking dhoni off,3
I would fucking love to watch them go all out and play..win it or lose all wickets...no nrr bullshit,1
Gg,1
Csk batsmen: ALAS! Thou finally hiteh a four! Now thou can rest for five years,1
calm down folks hope RCB doesn’t blotch this one up... they can lose from any situation...,1
rcb were 96,1
KP with the shitpost commentary lol.,1
Commentators sucking off MS hard,1
"Commentator's are so fuckin biased if it was any other player oh he has to go big, this is not time for this but yes exceptions can be made obviously for the one and only",2
"Ffs, KP.. Stop sucking Dhoni's cock",6
Strike rate is just a number -Kedar Jadhav liked that,4
"Shane Watson did well against Punjab but if he is gonna perform like once in 7 games then you are better off without him. Also, if seems clear Bravo is no longer a finisher.",1
"After 15 overs 

Rcb : 95/4

Csk : 96/3",4
Kp started wanking to dhoni,3
Dhoni’s trimmer’s battery ran down it seems.,5
Dhoni to show these plebs some classic NRR masterclass chase,7
70-75 off the last 5 is pretty achievable,8
Is dhoni going to pull a 2018?,5
Oh shut the fuck. Superstar? Yes. But stop sucking him off so much.,8
How can KP unironically praise Dhoni so much,6
Dhoni wankfest has started,8
Poor KP keeps trying to hype Dhoni up and always ends up disappointed,3
Aah KP sucking dhoni as usual,6
Rayudu slowly going full csk mode,2
Csk matches are boring other than with Punjab where two teams gives strong fight to make other teams win. /s,4
"It's amazing how the commentators still find a way to hype up Dhoni this much every time he goes out to bat, as if we're all supposed to ignore how he's been playing",7
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No. It's tuktuk-man,6
A single. Yeah,3
Kevin 'abbsolutte(ly)' 'intent' Pietersen,2
Looks like Dhoni used his beard trimmer for a hair cut,2
Every match CSK does the same shit kya hai yaar,2
He seems to be in thr mood today.,2
Lol the oldies just ran 1,4
"74 in the last five overs is a classic CSK story. They were the best at chasing, nail biting finishes. It's sad to see how hard the team has fallen.

For the first time in the IPL history, it looks like CSK won't make it to the playoffs. They need a serious reform, a new persona. The management has to prep for the next season starting now.",3
KP is deep throating Dhoni like its 2012.,12
Koach appears out of the 4th Dimension to stop 3D’s shot,4
"KP should just retire from commentating!
Just cannot listen to him..Get back Sanumanju",1
"Lol, now you show intent to run a second Rayudu? After a minor overthrow midfield by the opposition?",7
Please Chahal don't out Rayudu,6
Fucking run ffs. Those doubles converted to singles are what cost the game for this side.,3
"Nah, they aren't getting this",3
"As a longtime CSK supporter, that Jagadeesan innings sure ignites some hope for me in what has been an otherwise drab campaign thus far.",13
Omg dhenier,7
This is Dhoni's day we're losing,5
"From Cricbuzz

>Adarsh Pal: ""Dhoni has been under a lot of criticism recently. Can he pull off a vintage MSD-styled win from here and drive away the negative insignia around him.""",7
Heresssssssss dhoni,4
Thala not in the mood to wait around this time,5
Game seems to be RCB's but this is RCB so anything can happen as with KXIP,6
Dhoni Pachhaad six after a long time.,4
*Thalaaa daa*,2
RCB don’t take wickets here.,1
Alright congrats CSK,3
Kohli running and fielding is orgasmic,2
Dhoni's annual innings vs RCB loading,3
collective orgasm for the start sports community,6
Dhenier mode on😳😳😳😳😳,3
Why do i feel so weird all of a sudden,5
Lmao T20 is so lopsided that 70 off 30 is considered doable. Gotta feel for bowlers,1
When was last time he hit a six so early,2
*INTENT*,0
DID HE JUST HIT A FUCKING 6!!,6
Dhoni finally listened to /r/Cricket,6
Intent for real? Oh god. Are we sure?,1
"Not even wearing a cap, this is proper village/alpha/champ",6

But this hero worship makes me shit on one of my favourite players",7
Ohhh no that's bad that's worse omg,3
Fuck lol,2
Come on Dhoni.,2
Fuck trollers. They meme Dhoni back into form,5
R/ cricket is gonna explode,1
Whoof I just got 2011 flashbacks,2
Ofc he fucking finds his form against us,2
"Why do commentators suck Dhoni whenever he is on screen?

Are they paid to do this?",2
MS “Fuck /r/Cricket” Dhoni,5
"Dhoni using his feet for spinners
Oh my days. I'm here for it.",3
Is it happening,2
Love it when batsmen hit sixes in test matches,3
Obviously fuckin Dhoni has to go bonkers against us only...😭,8
MS make me some money baby,2
Six on 3rd ball wait that's illegal,2
"Tuk tuk man, tukked that outside",2
Dhoni showing intent wtf,4
Man i miss the camera panning to Kohli standing near the dugout and him cursing every single player of his team,4
Wtf Dhoni? That is so not Dhoni of you.,3
I uninstalled reddit today just to take a break. Had to comeback because that Dhoni wankfest in the comm box ffs.,8
Fuck that is some power,3

Don't bowl spin to dhoni. Get any decent pacer.,5
Csk batsman forcing Dhoni to perform,3
"Dhoni : “New haircut, new (old) me”",4
Say what you want tho dhoni looking thiccer than a bowl of oatmeal.,4
MS looked kinda surprised at that lol,5
That raw power tho,3
Vintage MSD,4
I swear Anjum has one hand down her pants when she's commentating and Dhoni's on strike.,5
I am not falling for this,6
"Ah shit here we go again time?

Edit: Nevermind lol",5
Dhoni always outshinning DK.,8
How shit are rcb if they bring dhoni back to form...,6
"I've said it many times this IPL but Scurran would be so much better suited to come in earlier in the innings, hit 20(8) and keep RRR under control

It's 2 or 3 times now he's come out in the last few overs, when the match is all but lost and ends up hitting a couple of 6s but in vain and I feel like he's wasted",8
Lol if Dhoni starts hitting from get go against RCB to crush them.,11
Is that....Dhoni showing some matchwinning intent? \*shocked\*,8
"Ohhh man, wish it connected.",3

Oh no Dhoni no you've got a meme to uphold what are you doing,9
INTENT👍🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽,2
Just 10 more sixes plz Thala,2
I don't feel too confident about Udana and Morris defending this tbh,3
"MS...?

Nah",4
I still don't buy it,2
pant would’ve been like “oyeeeee hoyeeeee yuziiii”,8
Dhoni single .... Single .... 6 ..... Wtf ????,9
Will Chahal feel like Stuart Broad again after this match lol,5
Please don’t decide to be good against RCB,7
Lol,2

Lolzzzs,1
Hahaha,1
Huh fuck,3
"I feel if you must bowl a spinner at the death, Sundar is the better bet.",1
Dhonis bat sponsor has changed I thought it was some Sparta something,1
"250 SR? Whoa, calm down MS!",3
I'm getting a feeling either Morris gonna get wrecked or picks up 4 wickets,2
bUt hEs bACKkKKKk,3
Saw the intent !!!!,4
At least he showed intent from the start,4
Lol,1
Talk nah Anjum... What were you saying?,3
I'd take the L for RCB here if I get to see dhoni pop off like the old days,2
SR 200 bitches,2

Lol wtf is that shot,1
Dhoni doing a curran,5
THALA SPECIAL,1
"Come on RCB, humble these bois!",4
Man:(((((( i could see dhoni do it:((,6
Even Intent™ couldn't save him,8
Poor Koach out of all days today is the day Thala decides to go all in,1
Hahahahahaahhahahaahhaahhaahahahahahahhaahahahahahahahhahaahahahahahahahahah,1
Finally he shows intent and this happens. He is absolutely finished.,4
Sam curran i have VCed u in fantasy nothing less than a 40(18) from u,3
10(6) i will take this,7
BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,4
Now this is gettable..... Don't keep sam on strike please,3
Lol all that finisher and intent talk,7
"D.dhenier, you beauty :)",7
"Well, atleast Thali tried. Fuck Ruyudu, he is not even bothered.",9
It's time to retire comments incomming...,5
"Slogger !!!
Nothing else.",1
Ala re ala Dhoni Thala... oh wait. I was still typing it,5
Chahal’s brave bowling does it again. What a gun player,7

Heh heh heh ...,1
Hahahaha blessing is disguise,2
Thank god,1
That split tho 😳,5

unless Curran or Jaddu pulls of a blinder..",2
"He is meeting the run rate in checkt 
Right guys?",2
"Good, at least there was some intent to hit the ball from Dhoni in this innings.",5
Hehe sorry for doubting thala. You still the meme man,5
who's the girl in rcb dugout?,2
KLPD level MAX,4
Lmao best finisher ever.,3
Lol boom boom,2
"Despite getting out for 10, best innings Dhoni played all tournament.",13
"Tactical wicket sacrifice with Intent, pack it up now bois",3
good intent.,4
Saving NRR Mission Failed XD,6
It was a different Dhoni today,8
Well at least he got out hitting,5
Daddy no 😢,3
Dhoni be like :- Idhar aa Madarchod r/cricket terko intent dikhata hu,11
Lmfaoooooooooo. It's a gg boiiiiss,5
RCB fan but this feels sad 😒 Give us a heartattack one more time Dhoni!,5
"Fuck, we deserve to lose",5
Something something should've taken it deep,2
Another class act by Dhoni. All hail Dhoni.,3
NRR Dhoni > Intent Dhoni?,8

please send curran please i beg,3
Chalo hood night,2
FUCK OFF DHONIIII,-4
"Yess finally Rcb beating csk,I’m absolutely lovin it",4
Okay this was so much better than wasting 20 odd balls.,11
Hahahahahahahahhahahahaahahaa,3
Batting deep,3
Even as he gets out the commentators are gushing over him smh,3
YASSSSSSSSS I WAS DEFINITELY NOT SCARED OF SHAVED DHONI HAHAHAHA,6
[removed],6
"He did it, the madman actually did it",3
Now just don't get out Rayudu let him play as much as he can,2
"csk are likely waiting for the req run rate to go over 20 ,so that virat can  come in and bowl the 19th over again.",8
"Gurkeerat, our specialist fielder",3
Atleast didn't fuck up the momentum.,6
"RCB fans well done when you win but csk winning just bunches the teams together, I'm sure you'd understand",5
At least he didn’t waste any balls and showed intent. Much better to get out this way,11
KLPD,2
"Honestly this is the Dhoni we want. 
Who tries at least",20
Atleast showed intent. 👏,7
Intent dies.,1
Full points for intent though. Will take this any day over 10(15),10
Anjum KP shut the fuck up now.,6
So Thala shows intent these two matches and gets out cheaply. I want the batdeep Thala back,3
Dhoni went from the dude who aced every test without effort to the dude who has 15 backs in 3 semesters not giving a fuck if he fails another one or not,12
Much better from Dhoni. At least he showed some intent and gave way for Curran to come.,4
Atleast he was trying something today,7
I'll take this Dhoni over any other Dhoni from previous games,16
"Remember when Dhoni almost hit 26 off of Umesh in the last over and almost won the match? 

[I remember](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/commentary/1178414/royal-challengers-bangalore-vs-chennai-super-kings-39th-match-indian-premier-league-2019)",4
I would piss myself if RCB loses from this point. But they've almost lost against MI when they were at much better position at this point. Fuck me,11
Thella supara,2
"Smart bowling, made him reach for it.",6
9/10 RCB's luck that would have been dropped and pushed over to 6!,8
Woah thala made 10 in 6 balls with a strike rate of 166.7.... **Legend**😍😍,4
"*STRIKE RATE IS JUST A NUMBER*

*WICKET GONE IS JUST A NUMBER.*

*10 (6) IS JUST A NUMBER.*

*ANJUM IS JUST AN IDIOT.*",15
At least he didn't waste balls and he gave a slight push. Finishers need to get this close.,2
"Should have come down the order.

At least saves him the embarrassment",1
Now this is called Intent.,11
Alteast he's trying now. That's good,6
"This is how Dhoni should play always, I have no problem with this. It is 1000 times better than what he's been doing lately",9
Lads it's chennai!!!!!!,2
"To be honest, I'd take this Dhoni innings over the ones that he loses without intent.",26
I like this Dhoni much better than I'll do it in the 19th over Dhoni.,8
Oh man it's sad to see dhoni like this. Even till last year I was scared when he was batting,8
I can hear r/cricket collectively having an orgasm on Dhoni being out.,7
"6D chess by Dhoni, get out early hitting so no one can blame you.",10
"""ARRE MODIJI AKELE KITNA KARENGE?!""",7
"Dhoni gets out. Comm box: ""You can see the power in dhoni, the thighs, almost split""",4
From r/cricket...take that dhoni,5
"Ill take 10(6) over anything that has happened so far....

Curran bravo need to do something similar",3
sigh,1
It was the dhoni i have been waiting for so long but then:(,2
Best innings dhonis played all season,3
"Lollllllll are Thala fans still gonna pretend like he isn't finished. 

The match was set up on a platter for him.",6
Yeah honestly I prefer seeing Dhoni going out this way,7
Dhenier striking it at 166. Suck it r/cricket,3
"Atleast he tried, much better than playing test",8
Masterclass bitches,4
Now CSK has a chance to win.,1
Atleast he went out swinging,3
"**15.6** Chahal to Dhoni, OUT, **taken at long-off!** Calculative and consistent. Chahal's had a bad night tonight but with his last ball he's got Dhoni hitting exactly where he wanted him to. **106-4**

MS Dhoni c Gurkeerat Singh b Chahal 10 (6b 0x4 1x6) SR: 166.66",1
Smart bowling by chahal.,1
At least he got out trying to smash it,1
"“And he picks out ..... Gurkurarart”

Wut commentators. just say fielder in the deep instead of completely butchering the name",5
"Respecc dheneir for atleast going after it. 
You will be spared today (for the most part)",2
"Dhoni should come at 3.  Things are already worse ,it can't get worse than it.",2
"Dhoni holes out at long off. 
KP: See the power at Dhoni.
Dude stop sucking his balls dry, It's people like you that makes neutral fans hate Dhoni.",5
better to go out fighting than dotting all the way to shit.,3
"Dhoni did not waste balls, gotta give him that.",6
All that trolling got to Dhonis head. That's very unlike him. Could've won this match with his usual take it deep approach.,2
"Curran and Rayudu to do it
Called it first",0
Where is jaddduuu,0
Out but Dhoni still maintaining near 200 strike rate vs RCB.,3
Wtf Rayudu is shorter than Curran,2
"You could argue that his was best innings this IPL, not even joking",3
Even RCB can’t lose from here right? In last match people said Kings XI Punjab are better at being RCB than RCB...,2
At least he showed intent today.,7
Lol when your captain getting out going for a win is actually an improvement,3
Petition to drop Kings from IPL team names mid season,7
Every Indian's Nightmare- Sam Curran,8
"Gurkeerat:


❌batting  
❌bowling  
✔️taking catches",11
"Smh Dhoni, why play so recklessly?

Just take your time, play yourself in, no need to show so much intent from the outset",10
I’ll be honest. Dhoni has a lot of power. I don’t think he has lost any of that. Even his swings are great to watch. Yeah he got out but that ball still went for a long distance for a mis-hit on a ground as large as Dubai.,9
I'd prefer this Dhoni over the one in previous matches,9
"Oh no, Dhoni gone. 🥴",2
"If your finishers can't score at 20 runs per over, your top order can't play like that.",5
This chase has Sam Curran belting Udana for 25 all over it.,8
Under that RCB celebration is great sadness,6
"Rayudu has fucked us in 2018, don't let him fuck again.",5
"Dhoni is out of form from past 2 yrs.

That's the fact.",6
Let's see what sort of mental gymnastics Anjum and KP will play now to prop up Dhoni and his finishing touch.,3
Still more respectable than 10(13) and then hitting 3 sixes when you need 38 from 6,8
KP sucked too hard ... That's why Dhoni finished so early.,13
You need one Kohli here,3
All 4 to be bowled by Fast bowlers? If yes then this is done..,1
"The desperation to hit a six even when he totally lost his shape, that was Pant in Dhoni disguise.",2
If that was siraj that was 4,2
SC is absolutely pretty 💛,3
"Despite that 6, getting MSD out might be the worst thing to happen for RCB",4
This is a better Dhoni innings than any this season. At least he tried,7
"Kinda felt bad for Dhoni there 

Doesn’t matter if he shows or doesn’t show intent, he’s just unable to get into his groove. Maybe this season is it for him.",8
I hate run chases. All my homies hate run chases,6
"If KP wasnt allowed to say 'absolute(ly)' or intent, he probably couldnt be on commentary.",2
RCB is screwed now,2
"**Most 6s in T20 (Indians)**

Rohit - 375 (334 innings)

Raina - 311 (303 innings)

**Dhoni - 300** (289 innings)

Kohli - 293 (272 innings)",6
Curran looks so taller than his teammates in IPL. And when he plays test cricket looks like a manlet in front of his teammates.,5
"At least there was intent 🤷🏾‍♂️

Better than plodding along before 20 in 4 balls once the game is lost",12
I prefer this dismissal because at least it shows that he realises what was required of him in the chase,7
Like that how Dhoni played today even he got out he didn't eat the balls and tried his honest best.,11
"Dhoni has six hitting ability so if he just decides to go all out from first ball, CSK might just win 2-3 matches becasue of him instead of saving NRR.",2
"Dhoni after today:

**I know I shouldn't have listened to those fuckers on r/cricket. Batting for NRR is the real deal imo**.",10
fingers pointing ...... sunny g.. almost..😂,2
"MS ""ad"" Dhoni > MS ""finisher"" Dhoni",2
let’s see if r/Cricket ‘s saviour Curran can win it for Chennai now,2
"Just go for it boiz, nothing to lose anyway.",2
rcb may have won on paper but they’re the losers for not having daddy curran on their side,1
OUT,1
"Things you must do as IPL commentator:

1. Talk about the game
2. Praise the car when it shows up
3. Suck off to Dhoni",13
Now Dhoni haters gonna blame Dhoni for losing his wicket /s,7
This innings of dhoni was so much better than all his other innings of the tournament combined,6
Right Morris gotta prove his worth now,2
"Always respect your opponents no matter what, I'm getting flashback of 2012 IPL where master Virat decided to bowl in 19th over.",14
F,3
Yes DRS boys.,2
"As someone who is (still) dhoni devotee, it sad that he's not been able to play those shots now. The bowlers have read him and there's no counter offered by Dhoni. He could've changed his stance, footwork like Kohli did after an horrendous 2015.",2
What the fuck is wrong with Rayudu? He barely looks like he wants to be there,2
It's not Dhenier's fault. Gurukeerat just pulled off a blinder of a catch. Can't do much as a batsmen in these cases. /s,2
Rayudu!=Kohli ..... They'll lose it,2
"Coming in seeing so many comments still putting hope in Dhoni is kind of sad =(. 

I feel some of you are in an abusive relationship with Dhoni.

I suggest putting your hope in Curran instead, better odds.

Edit: Curran did not deliver.",5
How many balls does Rayudu need to get set?,3
That was out lmao i heard it in mumbai,4
"To think that this CSK squad has fine leaders such as Fleming, Faf, Dhoni and Srinivasan",1
Curran was my last hope for CSK.,2
This Anil is one big chut umpire lol,4
That’s out lads,2
"Great stuff from RCB, but I'm not celebrating yet.",1
"Lmao, did Srini mama pay off the umpire?",2
Cute boi Curran looking guilty,5
oh no curry chan 😢,2
"Nicked it, out. There is a sound",4
FUCK THE UMPIRE,4
No Quantam of Loss™ protocol?,4
That wicket was classic Chahal. Floated wide outside the off and caught at the boundary.,6
If anyone can bat csk back into this it's gonna be curran,7
Where was that fucker who was asking Rayudu to get out so that Sam could come in? I told you this would happen,5
uh ohhhhhhh stinkyyyyyy,1
Please out(ノ^_^)ノ,1
That looks out,3
This is when kohli started and dube started going berserk. Can CSK do the same?,1
Curran also gone,4
KP with guilty thing...,6
"Quick, someone tell Rayudu Chennai biriyani > Hyderabad biriyani and make him angry",8
Very weak T by Kohli.,5
Braindead umpire!,5
oh fuck off curran binning u in fantasy,4
Is Champaklal the 3rd umpire?,3
Curran is terrible actor. Lol,9
Well played RCB😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,1
Rock and roll soniyeeeeeeeee,4
I can’t actually hear CSK fans from the top of the table.,3
Curran knicked it.  Pretty clear sound.,3
Anil Choudary is blind. That is the only reason he didn't give that out.,5
face looks guily lol,9
I honestly don't mind Dhoni playing like this. Much better than that painful death with required run rate,13
"Not out I guess.

Edit: hmm out .",2
Wtf was the Umpire looking at? That's clear as day,10
"That has to be out, there was a deflection live",7
"Geez, these umpires suck. I mean the direction literally changed",9
Madarchod KP is speaking over the 3rd umpire. Chup ho ja lawde,10
Our death bowling is goood is this the real life :),14
I should start drinking,5
Wait wtf! Is Curran taller than rayudu?,9
that’s out,6
[deleted],8
Swann grilling the 3rd umpire lol.,5
"Chahal is such a good bowler, great for a leggie, has jigra will always hunt for wickets and does it all weighing about 110 pounds.",11
How the f* umpire didnt give that out 🤦,8
"Seriously, why do they not go to Ultra Edge first??? Waste of time",11
Think there was a little Scurran snick on that,4
Guilty Curran sounds like Guilty Crown.,3
So Curran is bigger than rayudu,5
Curran looks guilty as hell,8
Dugout making fun of the umpires is the best thing. XD,6
Guilty man,3
"Stfu Kp, curran's face always looks like that",8
Swann vs Third Umpire is the most interesting rivalry,10
"Swann : it's out.   
Umpire : ultra edge is building. 😂",10
Gas chaudhary fails at umpiring so Gas dandekar had to step in,3
I have had a few beers and i could tell he had hit it real time,10
"IMO Curran shouldn’t try such tricks on his first ball. Yes, it does catch the bowler off guard. But more often than not, it blows up in the batsmen’s face this late in the game.",2
“Ultraedge getting builTTT”,6
Swann and shitting on the third umpire is the biggest rivalry of this season,5
"I have been watching Dhoni since I started watching cricket('06), I am one of the biggest supporter of his in every debate that we used to have in school/college/graduation/office. I fucking hate to say it, but Dhoni is done. It's time for him. He's had a fucking legendary career that will be unmatched for many decades but I don't wanna see him do SRT at the end of his career. He's just done, he does not have the magic and intent that he had few years ago. It's so fucking devastating to say this, but eventually this time had to come.

I hope this is his last IPL.",11
Should've walked. This was clearly out.,5
"Why not just do a snicko only if you are anyways going to see it, waste of time",3
This third umpire sounds like he has a gun to his head lol,6
Swann going bonkers again,5
He’s clobbered that,1
Shit umpire geez,2
"That's a piss poor decision. You have to see that as an Ump.

That wide call was equally stupid. IPL needs better umpires.",9
That was out. Umpire should’ve given that,9
Spot on review!,3
Thass out,1
How come Curren didn't know that. Lmao.,6
Umpires bought for sure. Thank fuck for reviews,2
Village umpiring that,6
"Ball clearly takes a deflection.  


""Let's use Ultra Edge""",5
He touched it twice and deflected it completely but still given not out what,2
Glad to see shit umpiring continuing in 2020. Atleast that's constant,7
Loving this from Swann,3
I'd rather prefer Dhoni show intent & get out in the process than accumulate not outs.,3
Pls send bravo and not jadeja,2
Lmao swanny meming 3rd umpires,3
Who's building ultraedge,1
Lmao can hear the yeah boiz from Kohli over the stump mic lmao,2
Morris has looked sharp today and this is his first game after so long.,2
Umpires play for CSK?!?,5
r/Cricket just hyped Sam Curran out of form.,10
GG RCB. Hard luck CSK.,2
"I thought Sammy was short, until I saw him standing next to Rayudu, now I think Rayudu's a midget?",3
Did you really need Ultraedge ffs?,3
"Curran with a horror game, 48 runs off his 4 overs and first ball duck",6
What a come back for Morris. Doesn't look rusty at all.,2
You can see the ball move. This is some S P I C E,4
"He went for drs at 3 seconds left

Would've been funny if they ran out of time for this obvious catch",9
Ah the fair play award goes to somehow Chennai still,3
Can I get any bids for a jadeja sword celebration.,3
what a shit umpire. Thanks for drs,6
Game over. Most destructive player gone now.,2
Umpire looks like Mr. Bean,3
Dugout roasting the umpires lol,6
At least we will get to watch Bravo bat tonight,3
"""ultra edge getting built"" that sounded funny",5
Graeme Swann roasting the 3rd umpire,8
Sir Bravo hasn't fucked us yet but it might be his day today. Please don't let the match slip from here.///,6
peak r/cricket,3
"Nobody:

commentator: dream ipl????

fuck fuck fuck DREAM 11 IPL",4
Curran needs to work on his poker face,5
Mumbai would be accused of buying umpires right about now.,4
On the plus side. All CSK homies gonna get a chance to bat today,5
Umpire single handedly saving CSK from looking like the only fools on the pitch.,6
Kohli gon skull fuck empire after the match,3
why do we even bravo if we don’t let him bat. just replace him w hazlewood if we won’t or tahir,2
"If Koach is back to form and Morris continues to defend well in the death, I’m betting on RCB to be in top 3 comfortably",5
Tfw it becomes 51 of 18 again,2
"Virat got a review right?

This some 2020 shit",7
"Bowled Morris caught ABD. 

Can easily be mistaken for an International match",9
[deleted],14
Wanted to see Dhoni bat more. Finally he started showing some intent. Would have been a great day to apologise to DK and MSD together but here we are.,3
"That was one of the worst umpiring decisions, you could see it on the batsman's face and all the fielders reactions that they knew he hit it.",12
Golden boy goes for a golden duck.,3
There is seriously something wrong between umpires and RCB,8
Curran needed to make 24 from one ball,5
"**16.2** Morris to Curran, OUT, **there's a sound on it and bowler and keeper are convinced.** They convince Kohli to review the catch behind appeal. It's a short ball at middle. Curran is backing into the off side for the ramp and there's a sound as ball passes glove and sails over the stumps. Early visions of the replay show this is a good review....**And Ultra Edge confirms there's an edge on that.** **107-5**

SM Curran c &dagger;de Villiers b Morris 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",3
"It should have been Bravo to come out.

Why ain't Dwayne Bravo batting up the order ?",5
"Before jadeja innings begin, he was bought for 10cr somewhere near 2012",1
Woah is anil chaudhary getting paid by CSK.... Don't know why is he on the umpiring panel after such a poor umpiring record....,1
"If this was not 2020, RCB wouldn't have a review left at this point, and Curran would win this match for CSK. But this year, anything is possible.",11
my guy took golden boy too literally,7
Ultra edge getting BILT,7
"They needed 70 something of 33, which was very doable. They’ve done fuck all since then, Rayudu is barely trying, Dhoni at least tried to go big today.",10
Run rate at 18 bois lets gooooo,2
Damn that attitude Kohli gave to the umpire.. there goes fairplay,4
"Never seen RCB dominating CSK like dis. Are we seeing the end of CSk,  the most successful franchise of ipl?",4
Kohli loves his Afrikaaners,5
Not Curran's fault. You can't take the rrr to 15+ every game and expect the middle order to win the game.,2
"Sam Curran is destructive against an Indian attack? Easy, use a South African bowler.",4
Wc19 jaddu please,2
"Makes you appreciate Kohli's batting in the death.

This pitch is not easy to bat on, CSK are barely striking at 6.5",2
"I agree with Scotty , Jaddu must come in early or he's doing very little in the team apart from fielding",3
Please throw the bat at every ball CSK,2
"Genuine Q. What's caused CSK's abysmall form this ipl? Last ipl they looked good and made it to finals. This one.... , they played enough dots to make a line",7
2020 has reverse-RCB'd RCB.,3
"Loosing to RCB is the last thing you'd want to, do you realise that?????",2
"Yeah sure, Jadhav was the problem with this squad",2
"Guys remember, you're witnessing history. This is the first time CSK is not gonna qualify for the playoffs.",5
Aaar ceee beeee biitchèsss!! Fucking yaaaaaaaaaaas!,1
I don't want to live in a world where Chris Morris is a better fast bowler than Dale Steyn,10
How low down the pecking order is Bravo?,3
Sir Jadeja is equally capable of fucking us. RCB please don't let it slip from here.,7
They've had a stinker here lads..lets goo,1
Umpires are the new RCB,4
"If they are gonna use ultraedge anyway, why not start with it?",7
lol csk dont even get an auction before the next ipl.,3
"Doge kp the player, cheems kp the commentator.",4
how is sam curran already out tf.. wish he gave this performance against India during that test series,7
I forgot how deep CSK bats. Punjab would have been well into the hairy part of tail by now,2
Where is DJ Bravo,1
[removed],10
"CSK  hit their first six of the innings in the third ball of the 16th over - the longest any team took in an innings in IPL2020  

The previous most was CSK's 14.2 overs against SRH at the same venue

*Cricbuzz*",6
[deleted],1
Let's just hope somehow Dhoni gets into RCB next IPL as his final so we can troll both Kohli and him together :P,9
It’s RCB guys still few heart attacks left,12
Umpire is blind + deaf,7
Wtf Morris? Where was this form last year?,12
Rather they all get out playing a shot and losing with a wide margin than taking it deep and losing. Fuck the nrr,1
Just take singles and doubles. Required rate is just a number,9
"Given how consistent CSK have been since the dawn of time, I can't tell you how much joy it brings me to see them really struggling.",14
"Look even our rejects like Morris are better than CSK main players.

What more do you want me to say?",-3
How tf does the umpire not see/hear that. There is no noise as well.,4
Rayudu's strike rate is so fucking pathetic,7
Chahal the chess player on display,2
As a CSK fan it hurts to watch our team like this. Miss you Raina,3
Apologise for shitting on Chris Morris after the auction.,7
Okay gayzzzz. I tell you a secret. 🤫🤫😮 CSK losing matches now cozz msD and stEphEn make plan to win last 7 matches. we LosE now so every team cOunt us out 😂🤣😜 but then tHalA come at lAst and win every mAtch.... keep kAlm and support CSK!!!! 😎😎😎,17
Is Mitchell Starc ever going to come back to IPL any RCB fans know?,2
Rayadu basically lost the game for CSK.,3
Just run like Kohli did in the death overs!,7
**SWANN VS 3RD UMPIRE**,2
"First that wide ball decision, now this! There should be a point system for umpires to know which one's more brain dead",8
As long as Rayudu is there we have all chances to win this one!,2
Quantum of loss mode ...activated.,3
Why doesn't Morris play for SA these days?,3
Isn't Bravo a better batsman than Jadeja?,10
"ABdV went for a golden duck

Sam Curran went for a golden duck

ABdV=Sam Curran

Hence Proved.",15
Ab toh aadat si hai mujhko aise jeenein mein,3
Imagine this game happening in chinnaswami and those RCB chants!!,4
Rayudu with the fantasy points padding,8
Straight to the fieldwr,2
"""Jaise ki aap dekh sakte hain, Rayudu ne run chase ki maa hi chod di hai.""

--Kapil Dev",15
[deleted],19
"Dude, Rayudu fuckin run.",9
This loss maybe not on Dhoni but Rayudu has to take the majority of the blame,8
"On tricky pitches like these, truly world class batsmen can differentiate themselves, which is what Kohli did. I remember Rohit also making a 70+ score in a low scoring game last year. CSK just don’t seem to have that class in their batting.",11
To anyone who was shitting on morris: fuck you,8
"All thala haters have egg on their face, look at his strike rate scintillating 160+ /s",9
Inject a CSK loss straight into my veins.,8
"How tf are we just 4 runs behind RCB?

I'm changing my opinion, our death bowling is what lost this game for us.",9
Damn! Morris Good.,11
so Morris was the messiah after all.,7
"Oh okay, VK is now at No. 6 in Most Runs

Rohit is at 9th.",10
Swann wants to change the entire IPL franchise-player system,3
ngl kinda like this new RCB anthem,3
CSK should come out wearing whites next match just for the laughs.,5
It must have been fun & enlightening for CSK to hang out with the traditional back benchers (KXIP) :) They will now feel what it is like,4
LOL GAME OVER,2
Rayudu out there sweeping Morris.,1
Morris really bowls like a T20 🐐,6
Some people were saying steyn would have been better than morris. Just lol.,4
What an over my Morris!!,2
Final rites being performed for CSK,3
S Curran had a really bad match,7
I wonder who will CSK fans bully on insta today,6
"Swanny has to stop with these naff loan system suggestion. 
If the team wanted those guys they would have prioritized them and bid for them at the auction and he is using the wrong analogy of the draft system.",1
Csk making me wish cricket didn't exist,3
Why sweeping machha,2
"That last ball was extremely smart. Saw him get ready for the ramp and bowled it full and slow. 

Really good stuff",4
Morris has been outstanding in his first game back from injury,2
Dhoni is an addition to those Indian cricketers who just can't seem to realise their time is done. Thats a pretty long list and its gotta do with having no clue about a life other than cricket,10
"Rayudu can hit old grandads but not the ball, he's washed",5
Wonderful death over bowling by Morris.,4
Even Rayudu is applying to Thala Academy now,2
Rayudu loves sweeping fast bowlers,3
Is batting really that difficult or are the batsmen just shit,7
Just shows how good an innings it was from Kohli. Runs are difficult to get on this wicket. Didn't muscle the deliveries and timed everything to perfection.,16
Is the Google live win probability fucked for anyone else? It's showing 53/47 right from the start of both the matches today without any changes,6
Rayadu showing why he should have been picked over Vijay Shankar for last world cup.,4
WONDER WHAT STUPID EXCUSE DHONI IS GOING TO HAVE IN THE POST MATCH HAHAHA,8
Kohli proved he's the top batsmen in all forms of cricket 🙏,6
khatam ok tata bye bye,6
Even Rayudu's batting style looks like Jadhav today,6
"The reality of not qualifying for playoffs is gradually dawning on me, guys! What do I do now?",4
wow the absolute guts he has to take a single last ball lol,3
Think dhoni is still chasing that higher nrr.,3
Total choke,6
RCB nicely assessed this is a 150-160 pitch. Great stuff,12
RCB don't fuck us over this time.,13
"Let's not forget how Dhobi batted in the world cup... 

Tuk tuk tuk !!!

That was the real intent.

It was poorly out of form then, and unfortunately hasn't recovered from that.

Cost us the matches then and doing it for CSK now.

Also, the midas touch in captaincy is on the down trend.",2
Can this be the first year CSK isn’t in the playoffs?,10
"yo csk fans, is there a petition out there to get the team banned again for a year so we can start from scratch again",6
"Bro Rayudu is taking singles now, did his small brain forget to take a single during the 10th over when he was defensive",5
Rayudu taking revenge for not being picked in the World cup.,7
These South African bowlers are really smart,9
Bravo will come out bang 6 sixes win them the game and start dancing “Champion Champion”,10
Oh lord how many times have we lost when opposition needed 50+ runs in last 3 overs.,6
This girl in Bumrah's dream 11 advertisement is cute.,15
CSK innings makes you realise how ridiculous Kohli's 90* was,18
"We found our death bowler

Morris 🔥",5
CSK has no respect whatsoever for Bravo's batting. This is complete disgrace,21
"BC that was in ""the slot"".. not ""Yorker""..",3
Imagine not hearing a nick in an empty stadium. Ffs Indian umpires are terrible,10
Rayudu dude WC is gone. It's not a 50 over game,6
I hope Udana gets a wicket here,2
I think all batsmen struggled except Kohli.. Chinnaswamy cannot give us this differntiator,14
Now CSK getting hurt like a bitch everytime they take it deep,10
So sad Sundar couldnt finish his quota,7
RCB is gonna get fucked if it comes down to NRR in the end.,5
It's not even funny anymore. How is there always an imposter in the CSK XI?,10
"CSK will go all guns blazing, when it's confirmed that they can't win.",4
Someone should tell CSK that Quantum of Loss™ will matter only if they get some actual points on board.,3
"WHERE

TF

IS BRAVO",2
"Ok RCB time to target NRR now.
Game is won already",5
"What is weird is, CSK almost didn't want to win. RCB just played normally. There was simply no challenge.",12
Thala 🅱️ honi absolutely bamboozled,4
Only an over by Koach can save CSK now.,10
"Need 64 Runs for 4 overs

and these batters sneak 3 runs from an over lmao",8
Dhoni should've come in after Curran. Fast bowlers are where he makes his runs from. Chahal has gotten him out before similarly.,5
"South africa is going to have the best bowling in t20 wc. Rabada, Nortje, Morris",5
ab is disappointed by that low energy throw,7
CSK will try and save the NRR now.,7
"Morris! 

Rcb finally have someone who could bowl good at death overs.",6
"after 17 overs RCB : 117/4, shows the acceleration from koach",4
Rayudu has not let anyone miss Kedar today. great soul.,13
"**Jadeja Runs in last 3 seasons**

* 2017 - 158 in 10 innings

* 2018 - 89 in 8 innings

* 2019 - 106 in 9 innings",4
CSK has to be the team with the shittiest batting unit.,1
[deleted],20
whats up with the lazy throws,1
"The IPL really needs a trophy for best NRR just like fair play trophy or  a ""Yellow cap """,1
Think max two more losses after this before CSK will have nothing to play for this season?,2
David Warner looks like a pedo sheriff in the pic,5
Too much reliance of Dhoni's lackeys is costing CSK big time.,6
Even 4s won't help now dude,2
"Other teams: We need a person who will win us this game

CSK: We need a person who will take the blame for this game",15
Why they are not sending Bravo,3
If they keep gurkeerat in the team I hope he gets a chance to bat. He's not bad at all,5
CSK to get 50 in the last 3 and lose by 10 runs.,14
Leadership Group Derby,7
I like the background music that was playing when they were showing tomorrow’s fixtures.,5
Rayudu putting in a strong contender for the most useless innings of the IPL 💪💪💪,25
Test Match #5,5
Wtf was that shot lmfao,10
Fitting end,7
"Been with RCB since 2009, lord knows why I haven't stopped supporting them. My life expectancy is definitely reduced due to my support for them.",16
Wah rayudu wah,8
Holy shit that was good,8
Lol got played nicely,10
That was the worst shot I’ve seen this tournament,10
3D wicket,11
GTFO RAYUDU.,9
Wtf was Rayudu trying to do lmao,10
Chudana 👌👌👌,11
"""No no we still have bravo dont worry""",12
That's a meme wicket,9
That has to be the most shameful way to get out but at the same time sums up his role this game,8
Imagine Rayudu doing doubles like VK. He’ll be retired by the wnd of the match,5
50 runs bana lo bhai aur out hojana,4
"As a neutral I hardly see any Match Winners in CSK, Dhoni is way past his prime. They have to let go of this attitude now of sticking with ex internationals, it's past it's expiry date",11
If Kohli is the Chase master then Rayudu is the Chase clown.,9
"With Dhoni : Losing by 10 runs 

Without Dhoni : Losing by 30 runs",11
"Whoa, middle fucking stump",6
Oh yeah 3D!,5
"hope they don’t blame that jagadeesan kid for this one, it’s honestly bc rayudu is slow and the openers shit the bed",8
Udana pointing at VK was so cute,9
That sums up CSK's story in this edition of IPL,3
Damn CSK. Lol.,3
Hahahahahahahahahaha. Fucking peak comedy.,6
Rayudu wicket clean bowled 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👌🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🤣,6
oh my god Rayadu! what a god awful innings. took up 40 balls.,3
So glad he didn’t get a 50,5
Bravo will bat for the first time in this IPL now.,4
"Zero fucking intent

Bravo in shambles again

Trashcan Rayudu innings comes to an end. Full toss lmao",5
Haha. Rayadu couldn't perceive the *depth* properly.,3
Every csk wicket gets progressively more absurd,4
"it's the end of IPL and every award is distributed. But wait, there's one more award. Every newspaper is hit with a headline, ""Altroz becomes an international best seller, 5 million sales and 58 million bookings in two months"". Ambani buys 50% of the company. And in the last ceremony, all the world leaders and marketing experts come because they are in awe of the sales. Everyone are just staring at one person, even ignoring the trophy winning team kxip. All the players, commentatros, cred dream 11 team with their hands jingling just watch curiously in the direction of person that made it possible just with a mic in his hand. it's Graeme Swanna. He's the reason, the man, the myth and the marketing legend. He sold the car like no other thing. He fucking sold it and now NASA insures his mouth, voice and brain for 3 trillion dollars because of the enigma he is.

Altroz super seller of the millenium, Graeme Swann.",9
"**17.3** Udana to Rayudu, OUT,  **113-6**

AT Rayudu  b Udana 42 (40b 4x4 0x6) SR: 105.00",2

"MI vs DC tomorrow, let's just give the cup to whoever wins that game and call the whole shit off",6
"Hey, at least we get to watch Bravo",3
LoL.,1
Udana you beauty.,2
bravo like that kid who gets to bowl and doesn't get to bat.,2
Missed a slower fulltoss,1
3D shot,1
What a fucking pathetic pansy ass fruit fucking innings from Rayudu,2
Sums up CSK this season.,2
How did he even think he would connect that shot lmao,0
"You can tell, Rayudu practiced that shot in nets a lot.",2
Holy shit! That ball was freaking slow.,2
Wow! Udana.,2
"Wish we'd batted first last match, could've had a chance",2
Lmao that was so sad,3
Wtf Raydu ?,2
"Let me say it -

Even shit Dhoni is better than other batsman Csk has.",11
Actual 3D chess by Udana,6
I know msd can't bat as usual and were making fun of him but ngl I had a sigh of relief when he got out,8
Udana ne udadiya,2
Macha ithu kevalam,0
What a slow shameful painful demise.,2
BRUH 42 of 40 in a T20 BRUHHHHHH,4
That innings from rayudu was horrible,3
"God I still remember when people were claiming rcb was fucked after the 3rd of 4th wicket and that it was a clear win for csk. Welp, time to pack it up",4
Wow Udana really set up Rayudu there.,2
"F that. I want RCB to win, but what the f was that? Rayudu",3
"r/cricket forced dhoni to play attacking cricket and now they gona lose NRR also ,",9
"Spare a thought for Rayadu. When Sam, Thala and Jagadeeshan were playing unlikr CSK. He stayed true to the team's Nature",8
"""This has been an _interesting_ innings from Rayudu.""

We know you wanted to say ""fuck all innings"", KP. It's okay.",6
Absolutely unnecessary aggression from CSK. They could've just knocked it around untill about 18th over and then hit some boundaries towards the end to bridge NRR gap.,11
Absolutely pathetic.,2
"Thanks for the innings, Rayudu. Much appreciated.",11
That’s probably the worst fucking thing I’ve ever seen,4
CSK is the real shit. KXIP are just bottlers.,7
"Smart bowling from Udana, well disguised slower ball",3
And people still wonder why he didn't play in England. He can hardly play any kind of pace,5
Don’t let them get close to the target and enjoy that sweet NRR,6
Rayadu should have worn his 3D glasses to see that!,3
Rayudu 42(40). Target successfully evaded.,5
"Fine innings from Rayudu playing on sticky wicket in cloudy conditions, excellent hand to prevent innings defeat of CSK.",7
"So fair to say Rayudu cost CSK this match?! 

Absolutely no intent right from ball 1.",7
"When Sundar got Watson and Faf out, the match was done.",13
"All these mugs hyping up SRH v RR as Warner v Smith, when really the main focus is YJB v Jos",5
Have you guys noticed udana always points to his captain after picking a wicket? Hope he has a great cricket career!,8
Udana trolling lv. 100 Fuck!,8
What a stupid shot to play.,1
Udana took over the mantle from Malinga. Lone Sri Lankan doing well in the IPL.,6
"on the bright side, maybe we’ll end this game with a rr above 6",3
"If I watch CSK chase in another match, I have to announce retirement as a fan.",7
Bc full on beizzati! CSK needs to retire PPL.,3
"CSK: Look at me, I am the meme now",7
Oh no. I thought Rayudu was supposed to be CSK's savior this year? I thought the only reason they lost earlier this season was because he was injured? Oh no :(,12
That was a bloody awful innings from Rayudu. All those match winners of CSK are starting to become burden now.,3
CSK fans right now -- https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/06/59487eff7263f.jpg,2
Aa bail mujhe maar,2
Rayudu shitting in his own mouth kinda innings.,6
So Kohli bulldozed both Rohit and Thala this round... Interesting..,5
"Okay, Champion is on crease, hold your horses",1
Yeah! 3D bitch!!,2
The pyas uncle giving wierd vibes,5
"We've finally found a good bowling core in Morris, Saini and Yuzi. And Washington Sundar has been a welcome surprise too. If only the batting is more consistent, we might actually have a chance of winning the IPL this year!",6
"Rayudu played 1/3 of the total balls (40/120)

And made less than 1/4 of the required runs (42/170)",2
Bravo is gonna do a DreRuss today.,1
[deleted],4
Rayudu should shut his Instagram. Rape threats incoming from clowns.,11
Isuru namma usiru😍😂,14
[deleted],2
FFS please Swann. Brian Lara tried to tear into Rayudu today at least 3 times but was interrupted by Swann.,6
Experience means dog shit when the ability is gone,4
So RCB  figured the bowling. Just get somebody in place of Finch and beef up the bowling further with VK coming back to top,3
CSK losing to meme-team RCB,2
"Bravo, Jaddu, Shardul can all hit",1
You could see that coming the moment he moved across his stumps,3
I think we can successfully conclude that Kohli is better than Rayudu,2
"Serious question: How long till bowlers start wearing helmets? Imagine a future superstar batsman who is bigger, more fit and has a deadlier lofted-straight drive than Virat batting against some bowlers with slower reaction time than Bravo.",1
Rayudu didn’t let us miss Jadhav,4
...and we thought KXIP's inning was shit,6
"I know KP has talked it to death. But I really don't understand in T20 when players run harder in the final 5 overs. It's such a short format, you should be at that speed the whole game.",2
[deleted],6
Game not over bois. Bravo can swing it,1
"I feel like Tyrion from that GOT trial, this performance has given me more pleasure than a thousand who**s could.",5
CSK's grandad team is slowly falling apart,8
At least bravo comes now,2
*Raina ko balcony dedete bc*,15
Why am I seeing Sehwag in a Vim advertisement fuck 2020 man,10
Rayudu: Jokes on you. I was aiming for the middle stump.,6
Fun fact: Morris is most economical bowler in the death in IPL.,7
Will be interesting to see if rcb forces a follow on. We can do better in the next innings,8
Genuine Q. Can captain of a team sit out a match? And what will happen once dhoni retires? Who's the new captain and face of the team?,4
[removed],13
OH MY FORGOT HOW MUCH I LOVE TO SEE CSK LOSE,4
if bravo hits i’m gonna be mad af that we’ve never sent him our,6
Haven't seen any comical dismissal like this in ages,5
Rayudu's shot was something I would expect from a tailender,3
Guess its gg for csk this season. Uncles and experience not helping them this year. Hope atleast my second fav team srh goes thru,2
"Okay, the fielding was more than decent today, hope I don't jinx it.",2
"Just imagine Kedar Jadhav playing today 

Just imagine",2
CSK need to get match winners like Tahir instead of utility players like Curran.,1
Jaddu and Bravo at the crease in final overs is literally closest we have come to winning this entire match,2
What a weird ass timeline we’re living in.,3
"I always thought SRH batting is weak, I have to rethink about it.",3
"*Removes Kedar*

CSK playing 11: Ab mein bhi Kedar",5
Koach really wants to win this one...,3
can we win this by 40 runs and get some NRR lol,2
lmao Jadhav you weren't the only trash after all,2
If he was our No.4 we have won the World Cup,5
Bravo and jaddu laughing at Rayudu,4
"No luck for CSK this year. I mean, they haven't even won  toss in almost every match among other things.",4
Our bowling has been surprisingly decent today,3
Wait till the RRR goes over 36+ for CSK to start to hitting it out of the park.,4
Udana has been pretty good so far in this season.,4
Bravo 2018 inning? Anyone?,3
Entire CSK team today played like Kedar Jadhav. Fitting tribute to him 😂,9
Rayudu has given his best.. Pitch is too bad for second batters.. Vk too scored similar score as rayudu while chasing in the last match,7
Balcony ka chakkar babubhaiya,5
Dhoni should have said Fuck off and played for NNR. Now they lose both the match and NRR,8
Rayudu better stay off his insta for a couple of days,8
Having so many older players was always going to come back and bite CSK. Luckily for them they have the mega auction next year. Otherwise this would have continued for another few years lol,6
To be fair CSK have had a series of unfortunate coincidences. They wouldn't have been so poor back in India,3
"Required rate at 22.8

Game not deep enough for the Dhoni CSK yet.",5
"*Removes Kedar*

CSK playing 11: Ab mein bhi Kedar",20
CSK might as well call up Chesteshwar pujara.,9
RCB defending totals \~ peak 2020,5
Idhuku Bigg boss eh pakalaaam,6
Today Entire CSK team played like Kedar Jadhav,6
Curran getting a duck is a good day for humanity,6
Indian stadiums helped CSK a lot last 2 season. And the irony RCB performing well by not playing at Chinnaswamy stadium.,6
How different things would have been if kohli was out earlier.,2
"If only Bravo, jadeja can pull off a pollard, pandya",2
Raina must be having the end laugh now.,7
No idea why bravo is being treated so badly by CSK.,6
Irfan pathan calling out dhoni.,8
Anyone think Sudan’s looks the tiniest bit like Giroud. Nowhere close to as good looking but still.,1
"CSK will need to win all of their next 7 matches to make it into the playoffs. Yeah, not happening.

Well the 10 year playoffs streak is coming to an end Bois, it was a great time.",17
Yeah I agree with SunnyG batting second here you have to score in the power play cause the pitch makes it difficult to score later on,1
CSK somehow must get Jinx from DC. Bring in Thair for Watto and continue with Jagga.,1
"*RRR of 38*

Slats: “You never know, couple of good overs with the experienced Dwayne Bravo at the crease, this could be a tight finish”",13
KOHLI SHOULD BOWL ONE OVER JUST TO RILE UP CSK FANBOYS,14
I'm trying my best to be more Buddhist in life by not indulging in judgemental though-patterns and staying equanimous in my reactions but Rayudu's a real Mara.,2
[deleted],4
"What a gun, man! If I ran 100 runs while batting, would not be sprinting like Kohli in the field. Say what you want, this guy is fucking fit!",20
"KL Rahul: "" Strike Rate is just a number...""

Rayudu: ""My answer is also same"" (in sarfaraz's voice)",4
On paper CSK are worse than KXIP,3
CSK is the only team that can make 170 look like 300,9
CSK The NRR champions,0
"I am guessing the real battle is between SRH/RCB/KKR for the 3/4 place, I would include RR but I just don't see it",1
"Always wondered why bowlers just not target the stumps when batsmen move, especially to the offside?",1
All 4 captains can’t perform on the same day I guess,2
time to join the haters and post memes and get upvotes. Better than nohing.,5
"BC either bat first or go hard in the power play. It’s super obvious at this point.

But take it deep and get fucked is what people opt for anyway.",6
"Rahul : Strike rate in T20 is overrated.

Rayudu : It sure is mate.",4
goddamn now i have to go watch the 49 all out match to cheer myself up,2
CSK problem shifting from only Dhoni's woes to problem with entire team.,2
we really need to end this well and get that nrr up,4
What an amazing death bowling from RCB. Can't believe my eyes.,3
This win should help RCB 's abysmal NRR,2
You can take Jadhav out of CSK but you cannot take Jadhav out of CSK,6
Udana is so good at the death. Don't bowl him in the powerplay please,2
They have 11 kedars why blame one lol,2
CSK still has a chance if they can get Kohli and Vinay Kumar to bowl the last two overs.,3
Oh man! CSK is the least exciting team to watch this IPL.,5
Unpopular opinion : CSK should stop assuming Jadeja would do any wonders and take team home. His last 3 seasons have been average (also considering he got better batting chances.),3
Haven't seen any comical dismissal like this in ages,2
HAHAHAHA Today Grandpa XI can't even play for run rate,5
FeelsBadMan. Been a csk fan for over a decade. Ain't used to seeing us perform like this. :/,0
I'm willing to bet that no team has lost defending 50+ runs in last 2 overs.,4
"I'm sorry but 54 from 13 and fans still hopeful? That's 9 sixes minimum required, I don't see how they can do this",3
Csk's long batting only looks good on paper. Shame.,1
On the brighter side we don't have to feel bad after losing the finals. ***Again***,4
"Dhoni is like Taarak Mehta. Not upto the mark since last 4 years, but still better than the other shit that runs on Indian TV",0
Jadeja can be so much greater only if he adds cover drive and some lofted shot on the off side,0
CSK :- What have I become?,1
Vote the match thread you cowards! Let's get those yanks something to be confused about this weekend.,1
KP still ranting about intent.. it's 19th over god dammit..😂,1
I want Kohli to bowl the last over and officially kill the Albie Morkel meme,6
"Guys Guys! CSK plays for NRR, not to win matches",2
"Dhoni so proud of his team. Last 3 overs, and req rate of 20+. Mission accomplished.",4
Who's gonna be the next CSK captain ?,2
"With Morris back, RCB bowling line up seems very decent with the likes of Udana, Saini, Yuzi and Washington.",8
Scotty speaking some sense into swaney,8
"As a Manchester United fan, losing like this is at least familiar territory lol",5
Raina laughing at CSK from his home balcony,12
"Look at me, I'm the RCB now",10
RCB NRR about to improve!,5
"Yes, fuck CSK.",2
"Man fucking his wife....



Pant: Ye Mai kar leta Hun, aap DREAM 11 ki team banao😂😂😂😂🤪😆",-1
Think this shows how important having a strong Indian core is. RR and CSK have overseas still performing but just can’t win games,5
Raina must be feeling like a god,10
The only time a one sided contest is fun to watch is when CSK is getting DECIMATED,9
CSK not qualifying for the play offs. We are treating this as a great upheaval. This is how consistently successful this team has been all these years,8
"Jadhav was not the imposter.

10 imposters remain",20
"Fuck you CSK. Fuck you guys. Don't even feel like you wanna win. No fucking plan in like every match. No fucking intent. We wanna watch a good game of cricket irrespective of our loyalities. But you make a fucking meal of a t20 game. Fuck you all. You don't deserve to win any of the games. Also fuck you KXIP,  you don't deserve to win either for what you have been giving your fans. I hope, actually I'm pretty sure these two teams would be fighting to avoid the wooden spoon this year. So much for a entertaining t20 game.",9
"Udana reminds me, if any of our Sri Lankan friends are here, you guys and your country are awesome. Can't wait to come there. :)",6
Man. If you told me after that AB duck I'd be grinning this wide after 18 overs of the CSK innings...,8
Nailed the Yorker. Holy shit.,3
Swann thinks he sounds like an expert but he is the biggest bum in the dugout. Styris please shut him up.,1
My god. I see so many Indian players trying real hard to get into India Australia test series.,3
Imagine being a CSK and a united/Fc Barcelona fan.,5
Fuck CSK,1
Next match for CSK is with SRH. That would be a good one day match I suppose.,7
Bits and pieces team. Bits and pieces,1
"Okay, just keep the ball on the ground and keep your legs behind the crease from this point. That simple",1
Imagine if raina had his fucking balcony!! Everyone here wouldn't be feeling like jumping out of one!,4
Why didn’t morris play so far in this IPL?,2
Never thought I will ever feel bad for the mighty Super Kings. Yet here we are...,1
"Indian batsmen needed in csk in transfer window.

So Tahir or hazelwood can play.",3
That from Rayudu is one of the worst innings I've ever seen for the situation,3
HOTTAKE -  JADEJA WILL HIT TWO SIXES AFTER REQ RATE IS GREATER THAN 36,4
"Been playing a drinking game all of CSK innings where I drink every time KP says INTENT. Let me tell you boys, I might be going to the hospital soon",7
Wonder how many boundaries CSK will score today after it becomes impossible to win to save NRR,2
I will be sad if VK continues to play even when he is past his due date like Dhoni   💔,7
Guys I dont think Jadhav and Vijay were the only problems,8
"Ab hum woh purane wale RCB nahi rahe, jo death overs Mein libir libir karte the.",9
I want to see CSK bat first at least. Like every team is losing when chasing this year,5
"If RR lose tomorrow, there will only be 5 teams left in the race while other 3 (KXIP, RR, CSK) requiring some magic.",3
One of my two dreams might come true. If only MI would play more like this CSK team.,3
[Jadhav Papa to Rayudu beta](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fdbz%2Fcomments%2F147v3x%2Fyouve_made_me_proud_my_son%2F&psig=AOvVaw3xrOZhkAfmWWEhXWlYqEN_&ust=1602437738219000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCIjn1fPHquwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD),2
Hope the toxic CSK fans don't start attacking Rayudu now,3
Rayudu is kind of sus,2
"I hope no crazy fan abuses Jadeja on social media. Guy's got swords, guns, horse, jeep and knows how to use those.",4
Damn!! That Yorker,3
"this is a rare complete ruthless performace from RCB.. feelsgoodman..(◠﹏◠)

all hail Koach..",5
*playoff streak has left the chat*,4
Can't fucking believe we made the finals last season.,5
"They are old, they are tired, they probably should retire-CSK",5
"So I will repeat what I said in the beginning of the match and got downvoted to oblivion.

“CSK ain’t winning shit”",4
Can Greame Swann shut up about this loan thing already? It makes zero sense. Why would teams pay money for players to play for another franchise just coz they can't get into their own team?,3
What was worse: Rayudu innings or Jadhav innings?,2
[deleted],13
We need to improve our nrr quickly before we get fucked by kkr on monday,3
Refreshing discussion in dugout commentary for a change,3
"I'm telling you, next over, ball is gonna hit Jadeja. It will carry him with it to the end of the stadium. The flight takes v long, so they make bravo play a shot. In comes Jadeja after rebounding from the stadium walls. He hits the ball with tremendous force sending it for a 6.

The ball hits the stadium, comes back down, and carries Jadeja yet again. This process happens 12 times. Umpire gives no ball each time. Csk clenched victory",4
Should I start celebrating or is it too early?,5
"Who thought RCB would win a match with 0 from ABD (well, almost won)",7
"Come on RCB, put CSK out of its misery now",2
Has any team won chasing?,2
For all the people who were mocking Morris's death bowling ability. 🖕🏾,4
You know Bravo just waiting to get back to the hotel pool,6
"Now one commentator will say

Mathematically still possible",9
So they achieved jackshit by benching Vijay and jadhav,8
"Excellent bowling.

This is why rcb paid 10 crores for Morris",13
We have two teams virtually eliminated,7
RCB will finally improve their NRR.,5
"Come on man. You robbed our star off a wicket.

Edit : Good Good Good.. Not for long.",7
Nice drop. We need atleast one every match right.,1
CSK should probably bat first to win games.,5
This chase is more hopeless than me writing final exams,13
"30 RR.

Game almost getting to that 36+ RR for CSK to really start hitting!",9
"bro, this team is a meme now! and trust me, it would be funny, if it wasn't so painful...",7
Padikkal redemption,9
IPL FIELDING,6
No.1 at dropped catches,6
"only four sixes and a single from both overs, not to be overdramatic but looks bad for csk",4
Padikkal redemption arc,10
For so many years. I have seen RCB losing from winning position. This match is too good as RCB fan,5
At least Bravo tried unlike Rayudu,6
Here we go. A drop catch was the missing thing.,5
INSTANT REDEMPTION IN THE NEXT BALL!,16
Where was this Bravo in that 1st match of 2018?,3
"Bravo: Here, catch it.

Devdutt: No.

Bravo: Well I insist.",93
Bravo: Fine I'll do it myself,9
*EIGHT SIXES AND GOODNIGHT*,6
"Ah yes, take those singles, reduce that net run rate. That should help you get into the playoffs even after losing every game.",10
Well... Here's your answer why Bravo was sent late. Lol,3
"That yorker😍 with morris coming in, safe to say we have a balanced squad now",2
Fastest redemption ever,6
I never in my life thought CSK could ever lose with such high margin.,3
That is called encouraging youngsters :),9
CSK gave up with 25 overs in the match to go real talk lmao,6
Ipl team managed by dugout and sponsored by r/cricket.,2
"Thank you CSK for the NRR, very cool.",9
"Devdutt rn:

Oh no....

Anyway",25
CSK not even playing for their NRR. It's over for them,8
"Every time rcb drops a catch, csk just gives them the same catch again",18
Padikkal redemption arc almost immediately,19
Bravo and Curran giving their 100%,8
Did he say sorry?,5
Shortest redemption arc,15
"Bravo really gave a second change for Padikkal, a real bro",9
"

This is why rcb paid 10 crores for Morris",10
"Bravo: ok, one more chance?",10
Bravo past his prime... Just like every other CSK player.,8
So who is gonna create a paddikal apology thread,9
RCB couldn't end the match without providing a bit more comedy. Gotta respect that,7
I am happy for rcb. Go on lads.,9
Csk is done. They need a complete revamp.,2
So sweet of CSK. They are thinking of our NRR also.,11
"I'm just gonna get off this thread, i'm rambling too much",5
"Good Guy DJ Bravo, gives you a 2nd chance if you drop him on the first turn",6
"You know what rcb? Just finish the game. Just Promise us you'll get into playoffs and beat out MI and Kurkure

Edit : I meant  KKR, my bad",9
WOOP WOOP ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN,9
RCB roasting CSK alive... how the tables have turned. Man it feels good to be RCB fan for a change.,14
at least bravo took the shot unlike our other braindead players,2
Anybody starting post match thread already?,2
"Generous lad, that Bravo",7
Bravo does this weird ass thing where his head is always looking at cover/point wherever the bat and resultant shot might be.,3
"CSK should go for Rahane if there is a trade off. They desperately need a Indian batsmen and considering how they have played, Rahane would be an upgrade.",3
Csk fans come out I just want to talk,12
Its nice to see Koach so happy,8
"**18.4** Morris to Bravo, OUT, **takes it this time!** A full toss outside off, Bravo looking to loft that over long-off but the bat turns and he miscues that. Padikkal with a similar sprint in and this time he's got his hands in position to grab it at waist height **122-7**

DJ Bravo c Padikkal b Morris 7 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 140.00",5
Nice csk giving padikkal two chances. This is why they must top the fair play award.,9
Can't believe rcb didn't play Morris from the start. He's such a great bowler.,0
It's like csk just doesn't want to stay at the pitch.,3
watching us absolutely ruin csk is so satisfying,15
Redeemed 🙏🏽,2
8 balls 8 sixes,2
"Can we start celebrating now lads, or is it still too early? Never too late for an RCB shitting ya know",4
"So now NRR is down in gutters, CSK will play for fair play award.",6
"Any Chance Morris will be recalled for South Africa for World cup? 


Such a gun bowler when he gets going. Would be great to see Rabada Nokia Morris playing together.",6
This felt like watching an ad in WCC2 to play the last ball again lol.,5

Man what happened to csk? Where's that energy? They never say never attitude? Dhoni explosion. Is it all limited to chepauk?,8
"Slats: Chahar can hit, wouldn’t count CSK out yet",7
Raina's absence has been the real reason for CSK's performance this year.,3
Jadeja and the useless runs smh,2
Yes DDP,3
CSK and KXIP: It is ~~good~~ fucking awful to be king,5
Can someone tell me if any team has chased to win this IPL?,5
CSK playing the NRR game for RCB,3

Love watching CSK lose.,6
Here we go csk getting close after the match is over.,3
Come on bois. Play for NNR. Help srh out,8

Good to see Morris in form with the ball. Can't wait to see what he offers with the bat.,1

Well done Morris.,2

"Find a team more giving than CSK, you can't.

Rcb beating both csk and mi was not my first idea of ipl20,10
Probably an unpopular opinion but teams should be allowed to forfeit when it becomes mathematically impossible to win.,-1

How many f’ing wickets have been lost to full tosses???,6
Damn! Isuru is bowling in mid 130s.,8

"Morris has pulled a reverse ex-RCB arc in that he's playing better at RCB, for us he was a pie sprayer down the leg side and is now getting two wickets in the same over.

I swear now if his batting also clicks ffs...",8
I mean the Spurs missed the playoffs this year. So it's only perfectly natural 🤷🏽‍♂️,3
Bravo should be eternally thankful to CSK and Dhoni for making him the star that he is rather than acting like a diva bitch,4
"Bruh, the hate for csk already crossed the limit after their last match, guess we'll see something next level this time",10
Will we get to positive NRR after this game?,7

Guys both the matches today were entertaining. Can't wait for tomorrow DC v MI.,6
20 runs needed per ball.. yes we can win this..🤩,8
Only Lord Shardul can win it for CSK from here.,5
Udana a really good pick by RCB. Hope more Lankan players get picked in the future. There are no Asian overseas players other than Rashid and Mujeeb.,14

Have to see through tough phase as a fan.,16
"Alright CSK you need a total rejig next season. Drop everyone from that squad before auction. May be you can keep Sam Curran and not sure whether Dhoni would continue. I still can't figure out why Dhoni never groomed a single young player to be his deputy throughout all these year's. I know about Raina, he's great batsmen in IPL but i am not pretty sure about his captaincy.

Edit: Total rejig means including coach",12
Csk distributing charity points to teams this season,11
bowl a yorker or even a full toss straight to wicket,4

Good luck CSK. Need 39 off the final ball...,9

Rcb can potential top the league with favourable ties coming up,8
There's been ALOT more shite matches as the IPL season goes on. Teams are finding each other out.,5

CSK games have been really boring.. KXIP are atleast losing close ones..,13
It's done bois. I can safely conclude RCB won,10

"Omg I'm crying happy tears I can't believe this

after years and years and years of shit bowling displays, my team has made us proud today and I can't help but be delighted about it. RCB have found their XI. Thank you Chris Morris. His inclusion has brought great balance to the team. We know CSK has been inferior this season. But seeing RCB defend totals by a huge margin is a happiness only we know.

I dont know what else to say. Im happy.",25
"I am just enjoying CSK games regardless. This probably the last time we see Dhoni playing cricket. Have been watching him for years.

I hope the management can fix their lingering issues in the remaining games.",10
I stopped watching after 12 overs. What happened?,2
Good captaincy by Kohli in today's match,20
Dhoni shaved his head off to offer homage to CSK playoffs chances being dead,17

Luckily no Jadhav to blame. Who's the scapegoat today?,18

"My brain farts of the last hour

1)CSK problem shifting from only Dhoni's woes to problem with entire team.

2) \[Showerthought\]: We Indians don’t get interesting original ideas or want to take risk in professional life as we don’t smoke pot.

3) Can someone prepare a nice visualization for an interesting stat I just though about?

Number of times during the IPL

(A) Dhoni won the toss and elected to field in IPL; and

(B) Dhoni lost the loss and was made to field. Split by years.

Is it even possible to pull this from some data source easily?

&#x200B;

4) Think its a 4D chess move by CSK. They dont want ONLY Dhoni to look bad due to poor batting performance (slow run rate initially). The CSK marketing team thought its better to get the top CSK batting order suffer too to make the villan the entire team rather than just Dhoni. That ways Dhoni's image remains intact. As at this point saving brand is more than winning IPL.",2
"Do we have to win 7/7 matches now?

Wonderful:) Feasible",9
Table looks damn spicy,5
"Was Jagadeesan good this game? Honest question, didn't get to watch his innings.",4

- Beating by 37 runs is RCB'S biggest ever victory against CSK",12
Oh my word. Dhoni talking about trying to hit and not leaving too much for batters after the 16th. Wtf happened to taking it deep?,10
What? Dhoni just orphaned #batdeep !,3
This match can be summed up as Koach vs Slow Coaches.,13
"Dhoni talking about not taking game deep

Hmm",6
"RCB <=> CSK

Switch",8
"Wait, guys, is this real? Our bowling is not bad now?!!!",43
Thala should transfer Karun in their team and play infront of Rayudu because he showed some intent,3
Dhoni talking about intent. Kohli rubbing on him,17
"It's going to be between KKR,RCB,SRH for 3 rd and 4th spots as of now.",3
"I mean, every team looses wickets in powerplays.. but they don't go into a shell and close out everything.. why can't we just take the game on when we loose the openers!! Someone needs to put their hands up and take the handle.. Rayudu was too casual in running and was just fiddling around.. jahgi tried but he was not directed properly.. and then the rest comes in at 80 requires off 5 overs and flops",5
I had something to say about CSK but then I decided against saying something because it is more effort than they put in matches.,31
Kohli's innings was better than kl 132,13

"**Teams to beat CSK (Most times)**

MI - 17

"When You're chasing a target of 170 runs. If you play 48 balls as dot balls, You'll never win the match. 
So far KXIP is not the worst team of IPL 2020. Undoubtedly it's CSK. 48 dots. Literally its 8 maiden overs.",38
I am happy for RCB fans. They stuck with their team in bad times and now they are doing wonders this season. I hope we have something like that too soon.,27
Taking it deep concept exposed !!!,12
Dhoni saying we can't leave too many for the late overs. Has he forgotten the game plan for this IPL?,10
Humiliating defeat this,2
Get a new ship CSK!!,3
Dhoni lecturing about hitting out and getting out without wasting balls. Yikes,26
"Dhoni - it's alright if you get out going for a shot. We need to show intent.

Dhoni in previous matches did the exact opposite.",17
I will still stand and back csk to win 6 out of the next 7 matches lmao,9
Gotta check Twitter now. It must have turned quite toxic by now.,15
The only cricket match I’ve watched live at a stadium was the RCB vs CSK match in 2010. It’s interesting how similar the scorecards of the two matches are with Virat Kohli providing a boost right at the end like Robin Uthappa did then.,14
No intent shown in captaincy.,0
At least dhoni is being a bit more hard lined in this post match presentation,14
"Looks like half a season later, looks like the penny has dropped for Dhoni.",8
Gurkeerat is the lucky charm,15
RCB are away track bullies. Confirmed.,25
CSK is playing in another dimension. Everyone is trying to win the IPL. These guys are playing for the Test Championship.,18
"Dhobians(probably): ""But...but we swapped out Jadhav. He was the root of all problems. Why didn't we win then?",14
Our NRR is still lower than CSK. lmao.,31
Also Dhoni blaming the bowlers for the final 4 overs.,15
My problem is No intent shown here.,7
RCB has to keep winning otherwise their poor NRR might come back to bite them in the arse.,20
Fuck!! I missed koach master class and our once in a lifetime master class bowling. :(,22

Great Innings by Rayudu considering the last session play on Day 5,39
"At least other captains give different players a chance.

Santer.

Tahir.

So many others sitting...just warming the benches.",25
"Anyone else love how loudly Dhoni shouted ""NO!"" When he hit that easy catch.",17
Dhoni should not say their batting has been a bit of worry. Actual word is awful,18
Mooen the explorer,14
Dhoni could have easily been the team mentor etc. He just ended up ruining his legacy by keeping on playing,19
How unbelievably good has Sundar been for us!!! Glad that RCB is finally using him right!!,43
"In a tournament where teams which batted first won most of the games, CSK never batted first. Lmao.",21
What exactly happened to Rayudu? He’s such a situational player. When MI needed to beat RR in THAT game he made 25(8) or something which was the perfect innings for that situation.,17
Csk is in the phase now where even critics don't care much effort and time to criticize csk.,12
"In 2018, Watson didn't perform untill final match and people credited dhoni for backing him, in actual Watson had the privilege of being in a table topper team   
Now that csk is losing i want to see if he backs players who are not performing",24
"Just open with Sam Curran in the Powerplay. 

Even if he gives you 20(15) it's better than the current standards",25
"Imo I still feel RCBs perfect XI would be Finch out Moeen In and Parthiv in for free traveler Gurkeerat.

Don't feel right to force ABD to keep.",27
"We gave up Cummins for Morris and saved 6cr
What seemed like a bad decision on hindsight, proved to be pretty good in reality.",21
Dhoni’s post match comments are interesting. He’s saying himself they are gonna be aggressive from next match,29
"we've won 4 from first 6, last year it was 0 feels unreal",51
Good win but had a small issue with Virat's captaincy. Why the hell did Dube even bowl? Sundar would have done a much better job and possibly gotten another wicket.,12
Punjab lower than csk shows sports is not fair always,23
"WE DONT HAVE THE WORST NRR ANYMORE, LEZZ GOOOO

^(we have the second worst)",49
"Serious question, did CSK consider too many runs? (not trying to defend their hopeless batting lineup)

The new bowl was bouncing and moving really well when Saini/Morris bowled. A finger spinner like Sundar had the privilege of long boundaries.

While individually all CSK bowlers have bowled up to their potential but CSK simply has no strike bowler. You can't rely on D. Chahar to deliver in UAE.

Also, even RCB was scoring run a ball till 13th over, it was some absolute masterclass from Koach.",15
"The season shardul thakur starts performing for csk, they're struggling to win matches",18
"Watson plays 1 good innings in 15 matches and people keep on backing him up calling him a 'big match player'. I never really got the idea of blindly backing a yesteryear star but then again, Dhoni is at the helm so you get where the logic is coming from.",25

"CSK has an excellent bowler in Hazlewood, and he bowled really well. But he was dropped. Plus Ngidi was dropped due to poor bowling in Sharjah. He took 3 wickets in the first match. CSK's strategy has been poor. Also, they should have brought someone like Manoj Tiway/Yusuf Pathan for the replacement of Raina. Tiwary has been always dropped from IPL/National Team; inspite of playing well.",24

"I like the Dhoni's interview at the end. He said  there was too much left to do after 15 overs and needs more aggression at the top and middle. In a T20, you can't have players at both ends trying to steady the ship especially when only two wickets are down. One of Rayudu, Jagadeesan should have been striking at 140 at least.",21
OMG we have 3 more games in next 7 days. It might as well decide RCB's fate this season. 😟,49
Kohli played so well. Many players would have gone hard after being 90 odd around 14 overs but Kohli dug in with proper cricketing shot. Understanding that 150 is enough is a ballsy move in T20. He's hitting the form at the right time.,71
"I just noticed, is there something wrong with Mark Nicholas's left hand!?",3
Might be evil but ive not seen a better sight than the look of sad csk fans lol,69
No offense but dhoni is really looking like a villian with that haircut,31
"As shitty as csk were today rcb played really well today, maybe this is finally their year!",20
The amount of feels im getting rn. Supporting RCB is worth it :'),49
"Actually csk should be at the bottom, but kxip are too unlucky",41
So Raina was literally the backbone of CSK. Nobody has been able to replicate his performances.,50
That the difference between koach and the all other batsmen around the world.,21
"Csk bowling unit trying hard to save their asses,
But batting unit is total waste not even trying lol",14
We are still looking a cure for COVID but now we understand it kills CSK for sure.,22
"Alright KXIP, CSK fans, let me tell you a story.

The Year is 2015. Mumbai have lost their match against Delhi. Now they have won just 1 match out of the 6.  

Link to that match thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/33lf9u/match_thread_21st_match_delhi_daredevils_v_mumbai/

Mumbai went on to win that year. 

P.S. Bumrah is getting made fun of in that thread because he still wasn't upto the mark at that time. 

Some users from that thread like u/trtryt 
u/TheWyzim u/sajdx1 are still active in this subreddit ;)",31
CSK badly missing Chepauk,20
Okay see you folks tomorrow for the MI match. Hoping that those folks don’t say “it’s an even year” when we beat them.,-12
"Rcb beating both mi and csk in the same year, I've seen everything",72
Reminder: We now don't have the worst NRR Guyssss. Rajasthans NRR is worse.,31
Imagine being so bad that you get beaten by a shitty team like CSK and that too by a humiliating 10 wickets.,13
Is CSK last on the table?,4
Has Raina tweeted about CSK recently or his contract dont allow him to do it?,12
"Twitter back it again, CSK is being full on trolled",12
Looks like RCB does better in grounds like Dubai but not Chinnaswamy,21
Anushka's happiness after Kohli's innings today was truly beautiful to watch,28
It's been either Koach or de villiers so far for RCB. Can't wait for that match where both release the kraken. Hope it's against KKR.,6
Kedar Jadhav was an imposter. 1 imposter remains.,30
"If Dhoni times it right, can we see him in upcoming Bigboss as a wild card entry?",33
I was really hoping for Dhoni to make some kind of statement on the threats made against his daughter. People who make such threats should definitely be called out.,13
"Okay, I'm trying to find a silver lining in this shit storm that CSK is in:

1. We acknowledged 3 matches ago that openers were showing no intent, then next match boom, we chased down 180@10 RPO. 

Today, except for Koach masterclass it wasn't a high scoring pitch and the RCB seamers bowled well, then we threw our openers out of pressure to accelerate. Happens sometime. 

2. we have acknowledged that Dhoni and middle order shows no intent. Dhoni showed intent today but got out early. Kedar has been replaced. 

3. Today MS acknowledged that you can't take too much time to settle in after a wicket and hopefully middle order shows some more intent next time. 

What CSK hasn't acknowledged is who is their strike bowler? Ngidi/Tahir/Hazlewood all are bench warmers. 

Ngidi on this track could have been lethal. Tahir was our star bowler for the last two seasons! Hazlewood is great early wicket taking option too. 

Now look, I get it these  oldies are not an in touch right now and we don't have great options and playoffs are unlikely after today, but I hope CSK will improve and won't finish in the bottom 2 at least.",31
"Chill people, if anything, a loss such as this will serve as a much needed wake up call than those close losses. 

I really think this would benefit CSK, jolt them from their slumber",14
"Dhoni in presentation: There are too many ""holes"" in the team.
Respect for not using *ass* as prefix 🤣",45
"Tum kitne Kedar Jadhav nikaloge, har player se Kedar Jadhav niklega

T - You can remove as many Kedar Jadhavs as you want, but what will you do when every player showcases his inner Kedar Jadhav",28
