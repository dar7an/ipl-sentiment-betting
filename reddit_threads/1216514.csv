Count it as short run. Has a big problem - what about when the non striker is trying to take strike. A weaker batsman/bowler is batting and your set batsman want's to take the strike. He will gladly have a short run just to face the strike.

2020-10-09T19:16:53+00:00,BoreHoRahaHaiYaar," All jokes asides, we still have couple of chinks in our armour that we need to fix before we play MI.

- Dhawan needs to fire big time. Averaging 20-odd with a SR of 120 for someone who bats in the powerplay is not good enough!
- Cannot afford to lose wickets early to their top bowlers(Bumrah, Boult) which unnecessarily creates pressure on the middle order, like it did today after losing Dhawan & Shaw to Archer in 2 overs
- Need to target bowlers like Krunal, Chahar & Pollard who'll bowl 8 overs among them. These are the overs DC should try & score the most since remaining 12 will be bowled by Bumrah, Boult & Pattinson
- Even tho the fielding today was better, we still are(someone confirm) the worst fielding side in the tournament, whereas MI are one of the best. This is where they hold the advantage.
- Even tho Harshal has been good, I still think we need to swap him for Ishant, atleast against MI. They have a heavy Indian batting line up & Ishant is someone who has played with many of their players & probably knows a bit or two about how to bowl to them
- How DC use their 5th bowler(Stoinis & Axar) is going to be very important. Need to complete their 4 overs before Hardik & Pollard come out.
- All in all, this is shaping up to be the most exciting contest in this year's IPL that too on a Sunday night, would definitely be a record viewership
- Key players for MI: Boult, SKY
- Key players for DC: Iyer, Nortje

What do y'all think?",29
