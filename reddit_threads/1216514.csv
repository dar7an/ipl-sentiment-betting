Well its sharjah bois. Sanju's 100 coming up soon,2
Will Sharjah allow Sampson to break his ill curse? Find out on this episode of ipl ball z.,3
my two favourite teams pitted against each other today. it's a weird position to be in,3
"who is gonna win the fight tonight?
Nokia or Samsung",6
I don't care who wins as long as I get 450+ runs from this match. Otherwise go RR.,5
"Rajasthan Royal's Twitter team knows [their shit](https://twitter.com/rajasthanroyals/status/1314407739314102273) well. 

Well done!

(Translation of the caption - Guess where we are?)",10
Is Stokes playing? Or still quarantine,2
"If Ishant/Mohit play, entire DC squad will have capped players. (Although i hope Harshal keeps his place). How many other teams have such squads? 

Although I don't want any changes to this team, i am disappointed that we might not see some unknown/younger players breaking through.",3
Anyone know a good place to but ipl kits that would ship to aus?,3
"Ah shit, here we go again..",5
"RR will have problems if they win or lose this match. 

If they win they‚Äôll make the Sharjah track bullies tag even more pronounced and they‚Äôll still need to find wins in other grounds since the quota of 3 games at Sharjah is over for them. 

If they lose, thats even worse since they‚Äôve lost the previous games and will continue their downward spiral after some brilliant games at the beginning.",3
I think whoever wins today will be the better team.,3
Will be interesting to see if RR top 3 will continue to throw their bat at everything in powerplay. Worked for them in sharjah so they might as well today but they will be up against two 145+ bowlers mind that.,2
I‚Äôve been having a shitty day. I just want to see Ashwin mankad buttler so that I can go to sleep with a smile.,3
"Ashwin vs Buttler.

Now would be good time to relive the [glorious wicket.](https://www.iplt20.com/video/154485/ashwin-mankads-buttler)",6
I either want Ashwin mankading Buttler or Buttler hitting 30 runs off Ashwin's over. No in-between.,68
"I feel bad for rr, no matter the result of the game, they'll be made fun of, if they lose, they'll be made fun of by saying they lost 4 in a row, if they win people will say rr can only win in sharjah",6
Little fun fact : This is the last match of tom curran for this year's tournament.,10
"Sanjay Bangar is the type of ""expert"" you'd find in DD Sports back in the 90s.",49
Looking forward to Sharjasthan vs Delhi today,8
"does this match count as the ""back end"" of the tournament?  


Ashwin for a certain WK batsman.",5
4d move by ashwin to give final warning against rcb so he can Mankad butler and no one would question the intent of our ethical lord,4
Letting go of Ash alone was enough to condemn KXIP to the bottom of the table,5
Need a spicy points table. Rooting for RR today,9
[deleted],3
"wait if RR lose this, does that bring them to the bottom of the table?",2
I have a feeling whoever wins the toss will win the match,2
Can't wait to see young Yashashvi Jaiswal belt Rabada today ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè,8
Sanju *Sharjah Mein Dekhlena* Samson Loading.....,2
Anyone else think Nortje and Rabada both are such a joy to hear? Nortje sounds so pleasant and Rabada is so articulate when he speaks. Great guys.,2
Delhi should drop Hetmeyer and play Keemo here . Rajasthan have to drop Curran and play Oshane . If chances are being given then Uthappa to open for a swan song.,1
I hope rr wins today so the sunday mi vs dc game decides the undisputed no. 1( atleast for a week or two),4
looks like rr gonna surprise everyone and win,4
Will Sanju survive the short balls from Rabada and Nortje?,3
For the first time in a while I think Sunil Gavaskar has given an interesting suggestion. His suggestion of calling one short every time the non-striker steps out of his crease before the ball is delivered actually makes sense. It does away with the whole Mankad debate as well.,9
A Tye to play ! Delhi better not bat first !,2
"Feel for Tye already, regardless of his performance will get replaced",7
DC spinners have been the most economical in this season (6.13) while RR being the most expensive (9.12) Axar klaxonüôè,3
RR opt to bowl. Andrew Tye makes his debut for RR,4
Aiight cunts! I got a free pass for the fantasy thingy. Comment your shitty line up and I will play that (as long as everyone is in the starting XI),-4
Imagine if Jaiswal strokes a fast pitched rabada ball to four through the covers. That would be such a treat to watch. Hope he stays at the crease for long today!,1
"Why is it that Delhi always bats first and CSK always bats second, regardless of whoever wins the toss?",8
"Don't really wanna see RR lose another one, cause I quite like them, buuut, my heart is always with Delhi.",3
"Lmao Andrew Tye, can‚Äôt wait to see him get cunted.",3
DC‚Äôs colourful jersey is better than the regular one.,5
Lmaooooo why tf would you choose to bowl? 220 always is a tall fucking chase and RR is NOT chasing that against us,8
I'm interested in seeing Kartik Tyagi in action,8
"Tye comes in after a year break, alongside Varun Aaron.
 WHAT CAN POSSIBLY GO WRONG? RIGHT GUYS?",7
"Alright tom curran,it was fun seeing you playing. Meet you next year",6
"I'm surprised people want to see more of Tom Curran, who has the highest economy rate in IPL of any bowler",7
"I'm just here for Tewatia

&the juicy face off between Buttler and Ashwin

But mainly Tewatia",3
Ignore the flair but am I the only one who finds Ashwin smug AF? Like screaming in your face smug?,1
I hope Aaron bowls that swinging knuckle ball today. Last season he extracted the most swing from the delivery. Some of them were a sight to behold in slo-mo.,4
alright.. I‚Äôm liking the changes in the RR lineup. hope the switcharoo helps them today,3
Rajasthan is chasing with Tewatia playing? At Shahrjah?,5
Robbie for powershot challenge? With jofra and tewatia in team? Lol,4
Wanted to see DC chase here. The only match they lost was when they were chasing,3
Lol rr why would you chase..Smith will have a brain fade again with the pressure,3
Got a feeling RR's gonna lose this by at least 50 runs.,2
Robbie struggling to time it even in the nets lol,8
Who wins today,0
Tye is a proper trundler. Picked up many wickets in one season because he bowled in the death and got many catches at the boundary. However this isn‚Äôt the ground for that.,5
"> 23rd Match - Rajasthan Royals v Delhi Capitals **at Sharjah**

Sanju Samson be like ""This is my time to shine""",2
"So many exciting folks to look out for in our team: Tye, Kartik Tyagi, Jaiswal & Varun Aaron!",3
"A well settled lineup is always a sign of good team. MI and DC are showing precisely that and CSK has shown that over the years.

Whereas panic changes are signs of things going wrong. We see that all the time with less successful team like Kings 11, RCB and RR.",5
The main question in this game is how long will Andrew Tye take to reach his 50? I'm guessing 18 deliveries.,-1
Ashwin v Buttler yessssss,4
"DC: W W L W W __

If this is a math quiz, we know how this sequence will continue. Panic Friday ngl.",22
Everyone shitting on Tye. He‚Äôs said he‚Äôs at his best ever. Feel like he‚Äôll get a couple wickets,4
"Why don't they do the six hitting challenge, owner's match, etc anymore? Those were little which gave the ipl a carnival like feeling. Not to mention the Sony Max Extra innings with the catchy theme songs for the IPL and Gaurav, Sameer, Archana and Shibani. They weren't cricket experts but it used to be so much fun! I love the way it is done now too, just that it seems a bit too technical and too overanalyzed, taken too seriously.",1
"I know there is dew factor + the fact that it is Sharjah but the chase against Punjab came against probably the most toothless attack in IPL and Tewatia did a once in a lifetime thing.

Why would you choose to chase?",3
Why is the host wearing a turtle neck??? Isn't the studio in Dubai?,2
"If DC win today and RCB win tomorrow, then we pretty much would be having only 5 teams competing for 4 spots.",-4
"I feel for David Miller. Guy played a game, got run out for a duck without playing any ball and will most likely not be picked up in games ahead (with Stokes coming).",40
I think Axar and even Ashwin might leak a lot of runs.,5
[deleted],-4
"Andrew ""Australian Siraj"" Tye is so gonna get hit for 45 or more",37
AJ Tye has an IPL hattrick if i remember. Lost that match though,3
Is it possible to make cocktails out of the spirit of the game? ICC needs to investigate.,8
Plz for gods sake let this be a match where more than 500 runs are scored and a super over decides the game.,4
"We have this one last match left in Sharjah, better win this one...

8 matches left will be in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.. FK, we need to start winning on those grounds too.",7
"If Jaiswal played for MI, he would‚Äôve somehow already scored a 20 ball 50 by now. No better franchise for young players than MI.",-4
"Bangar is surely a great reader of the game, but he doesn't present that knowledge equally well",9
"Unrelated - Bairstow, Jordan, Washington Sundar, Bravo - all lost matches on their birthdays.

Is it anybody's birthday in the team today?",2
welcome to they-have-the-best-chance-to-win-ipl-this-year vs they-have-the-best-chance-to-win-ipl-this-year game!,-3
"Rajasthan has won 2 matches in Sharjah but both have been against the worst teams of this year 

Delhi - 85:15 - RAJASTHAN",2
"Thought Sams or Keemo will play ahead of Hetmyer this game. Don‚Äôt think they would need 6 batsmen today. Axar and Ashwin can easily score here, also Sams/Keemo are quite capable with the bat plus provide an extra bowing option",3
Wanna see Oshane Thomas in that overseas bowler spot- he has real talent and on song is so dangerous,2
"Want to see Delhi win, but would love to see a butler special üòç",1
Waiting for Tewatia vs Rabada,3
"During Ashwin‚Äôs 4 overs today, first time in history, the focus would be more on non-striker batsman.",75
Who's that lady presenter in English commetry,2
Is Stokes' quarantine still not over?,6
How are they calculating stamina meter?,1
"i thought the serial downvoter is back, but oh nvm ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•",2
"Can't wait for Ashwin to come out to bat, only for Smith to make a shock decision to give Buttler the ball so that he can exact his revenge",37
Ashwin mankading butler today will save my 2020,11
RR started with 2 wins and are now at second last...,7
I don't get why RR chose to bowl first...,7
"Looking at the current form, I would say DD and MI will qualify with any 2 of RCB, KKR and SRH

No hopes from CSK and KXIP. 

RR would have to do a Mumbai from 2015. Not ruling them out just yet.",4
Why is Curran out?,4
Odds on Varun Aaron conceding 75+ today?,-1
"Imagine RR surprises everyone by bowling DC out for less than 100 and chase it in less than 10 overs and then jump to third place.

Absolute scenes.",2
Anyone else thinking of switching between this game and Nadal Schwartzman?,2
Oh we are still playing. I thought they already gave the title to Delhi because they were too good for the teams.,-9
I wish KP would talk about the team line up instead of waffling on.,3
Which numbskull decided to pick varun Aaron at sharjah? RR chasing 250 today,2
Key and Peele forever ruined the name Aaron for me.,4
Tye in for Curran aye. Is this good or bad people ?,1
That haircut doesn't suit yashswi Jaiswal.,3
Hello boys,2
"Was waiting for this and MI match.. gonna be serious fun if our batters get going..
Very good changes by RR. Shows they are hurt by previous loss.",0
Delhi Capitalists vs Rajasthan Royals,0
"Watch this cursed video to curse yourselves - 

https://youtu.be/gfPMCTzL3EY",-4
ideal dismissal for DC is Ashwin mankadding someone and then Rabada proceeds to give a sendoff. Make it happen.,0
I knew there would be a meltdown here when rr chose bowling,0
"On this testicular sized ground, anything is possible.",1
Where the F is Ben?,2
Lord Tewatia is going to face his ex team today- afraid of his revenge,7
Shaw 232*,1
Will have to wait until the second innings for Samsung vs Nokia.,9
That hair is the heaviest bit about Jaiswal. He'll still eclipse Bradman though,3
I wouldnt underestimate RRs -Tye is T20 specialist with knuckle balls & we all know Jofra the Falcon. And hands down Buttler is one of the best T20 batsmen if not the best.,6
inb4 varun score a half century,3
I remember varun aaron as the guy who broke stuart broad‚Äôs nose ngl,6
"What if they're called Delhi Capitals because Delhi is the Capital of the country?

Bruh!",14
Petition to change the name of the ground to Sharjastan if Rajasthan wins this,31
Just take a 3 wicket maiden in the power play to get yourself off to an ideal start,8
Hope aaron doesn't get hit much just so we don't have to see rajpoot again,2
Varun Aaron was the promise that never actually delivered. He had been a very quiet guy who went about his business but just lost his way later on.,4
what the fuck was that cross-legged stance lol,6
Lord Varun in playing X1 @Sharjah. üòÇ,4
"Guys, why don't they do the six hitting challenge, owner's matches, etc anymore? Those little things along with Set Max is what gave IPL this carnival like feeling. Also, might be a controversial opinion but I really liked Gaurav, Sameer, Archana and Shibani and their pre and post match shows. Not to mention the catchy IPL theme songs, which for the last few seasons has been meh. Although they weren't experts, it gave me this summer vacation fun kinda feeling and was light. Nowadays I just think it's too professional and kind of overanalyzed. At least the cricket stays the same.",9
140 damn didnot expect,2
Came back from F1? Atleast cricket is uninterrupted,5
Thank you RR for getting rid of Tom,5
Camera is too low,5
Damn seeing varun aaron bowl got me nostalgic,2
Feel like Stoinis has the face of someone who has done a lot of roids.,3
I feel DC batsmen will have an off day. They've been too consistent recently and thats not in spirit of the Delhi franchise.,6
"Didn‚Äôt realize archer is officially classified as an all rounder

He should be tho",2
Jaiswal is his pink floppy may be just as cute as anything I've seen on a cricket field.,10
Prithvi has probably been asked to go guns blazing to make up for Dhawan's slow starts. Gotta make up for the Sharjah premium..,10
Someone tell Ganguly ARUNNN is back.,3
Slower ball in the first lol rookie mistake,3
with Aaron and Andre Tye RR is looking very strong and balanced,2
"The cameraman was really high during the mi vs srh match in shrajah, I hope there's a better cameraman today",4
Dhawan is done with this line and length shit.. some boom boom time coming..,2
Surprised that didn't go out of the park lol,1
100 on that Jersey looks ugly,3
Still remember Aaron's sheer pace from 2015 Ind SA test series,5
Good to see tye in the team. He will have to come back when the englishmen leave if they qualify for the playoffs.,-1
Sharjah cameraman back at its game,6
Mankad watch: come back when DC is bowling,1
Throwback to the I was confused between Varun Aaron and Umesh yadav,2
Dayum rr packing a long tail,3
Shaw and Dhawan didn't get the memo.. sixes not fours are the trend on thia ground ;),3
"Finally Rr opening with Archer

Give him 2 fuckers",4
"Mr sr 600 getting smashed of his own first ball, retribution!!!!",6
"Not sure if I hate Varun Aaron for ruining Stuart Broadman for several years, or love him for his part in helping Broad become the ultimate meme player",7
"Dilemma for Samson:

\* Score in this match and get called a small ground bully

Archer bowling slow because Root has overbowled him this tournament,6
üéÇ,3
YESSSS bhenchod,5
well well well what do we have HERE,4
I want Delhi to lose this match just to keep the tournament more interesting,10
Loose shot.. come on shikhar.. u are the senior pro.. should have done better.,4
Lol,4
"Oof

Hit that well, just straight to the fielder

Good field setting tbf",3
üéä,3
Thank god the commentators mentioned Archer's lack of powerplay wickets cause now he's got one,12
Damn it.,2
"Wow, that's one way to get out. On the pads, straight to fielder",5
Is the RR Jersey supposed to simulate the workings of Nine tampons who are the sponsors ?,1
Delhi will shit the bed today,6
"**1.3** Archer to Dhawan, OUT, Archer's first wicket in a Powerplay this year. It has taken him 51 balls **12-1**

"Sunny criticizing ball on the leg. Next delivery, same ball delivers a wicket",5
Really hope iyer keeps the foot on the accelerator and not just rotate the strike,4
Anyone here from F1 weather disappointment?,3
"Goneski

That is why u open with archer

Archer is not only a death bowler is what Rr need to learn",2
Why is Mayank Markande and Oshane Thomas not being given a chance?,3

How many bouncers can you bowl in an over? Ridiculous,2
Who got better Teeth? Buttler or Boult,-1
2nd bouncer this over. Poor umpiring.,1

Will you shut up Kevin man?,1
I wish Delhi were more flexible with their batting order tbf. Could have sent in Stoinis or Hetmyer in at 3 IMO.,1
Dhawan feels like a different player from 2 years ago,2
Is it just me or do Delhi look uncomfortable? THE LORD TEWATIA EFFECT???,0
"The commentator said ""Some of the greats..."" and the camera cuts to Varun Aaron. Don't tell me this is a coincidence",3
"How does RR have Aaron Rajpoot AND Unadkat, someone's taking the mickey",1
Thank God Iyer doesn't intend to bat in tuktuk style today,6
"Was perfect opportunity to send Stoinis up the order today, the form he is in and these short boundaries, would have been tremendous fun..",2
"I love watching Jofra bowl usually, but it's becoming unbearable because of the commentators.

He bowls fast? ""Why would you bowl slower balls when you can do that?""

He bowls a slower one? ""Why are you bowling slower balls when you can bowl fast?""

It's at least three times an over. He's one of the best white ball bowlers in the world. He knows what he's doing. He went for 25 on this ground this season, in a 200+ vs 200+ game, with 60m boundaries, ffs.",23
Lol. Lord Aaron is back bitches!!,6
smh no ball in sharjah bro,3
Oh cmon Sharon,2
Lmao no ball,1

I don't understand the hate for Kevin. He can be repetitive sometimes maybe but he's a cinnamon roll ü•∫ I may be biased because I have a crush on him but why do y'all hate him?,2

"*Aaron bowling dot balls*

Aaron: oh no... let me fix that",3
Poor Aaron,9

"Archer doent bowl next

I swap from RR to DC",5
"I like this shot.

Give me more of this shot.",4
Jeez I didn‚Äôt know Shaw was this good. When he played for the national team he wasn‚Äôt this consistent,4
I was just about to say aaron was bowling well and then he just bowls a half cracker,2
Shaw's got a technical flaw against the bouncer. This is the third or fourth time he's tried to pull while staying beside the line of the ball and almost always its gone straight up in the air.,3
Why is Alex Carey not being given a chance?,3
"STFU Sunny, he‚Äôs not ‚Äútrying to look good on television‚Äù by falling.",30
Welcome back Varun Aaron. ffs,4
Casual reminder that Mr. Varun Aaron was one of our frontline pacemen in the 2012 Test series down-under.,13
Fuck this stadium,13
I remember Varun Aaron bowling 150 kmph against Australia once and I hadn‚Äôt heard of him since,12
How much do you think they will make in this Cred Powerplay?,1
Ngl keeping Archer for death overs is a good move considering DC's depth in batting,2
"Poor Aaron, gets a game after missing 4 of his teams matches and gets a catch dropped off him and Shaw rubs it in with a 6 next Ball.",8
Tyagi is an amazing bowler(watch me post it and him immediately getting dispatched for a boundary),6

Varun Aaron eventually bowls shit. However good he looks at the beginning. Tragedy of his career,7
"Of course Swann hates mankading, he is English after all.",17
Sharjah oh Sharjah,3

Why is Pointing not being given a chance,14
Hope he bats like Chris Martin,1
"Lol, Indian Chris Martin.",3
"Tyagi is a budget Brett Lee, IMHO.",5
I remember a time when Varun Aaron was constantly clocking 147+ against dhoni and was considered a potential Brett Lee for India lol,9
"Tyagi bowls from very wide on the crease

I'd like to see him adjust that",4
"Tyagi to me looks like a Srilankan bowler, not his looks his action",5
Everybody sees everybody in Karthik Tyagi.,50
That should be a no ball for 2nd bouncer above the shoulder.,2
This DC batting is too good. They can afford to carry Dhawan as baggage and still dominate this season. Waiting for MI vs DC.,3
Get in gopal against Shaw,2
Tyagi could generate a lot of bounce because of his action and release point,6
This Tyagi guy is confident I like that,7
Why is Sreesanth not being given a chance?,4
"Nobody bats better than Chris martin, Sunny G",3
They're bowling short too much,0
Come on Archer. Bowl a 160+ delivery,2
T20I World Cup should be played in Sharjah,3

"Actually a decent pull shot from Shaw

And he ruins it next ball lmao",8
Fuck yesssssssssssss Archer,2
Damn that's a good fucking catch,6
Short ball weakness? Nailed that one then,7
"Fuck yeah Joffra, fuck yeah",4
Shaw is so fucking overhyped üëé,-8
All I want is a Rishabh Pant century. Can one of these two please get out quickly?,2
Shaw said ‚Äòah shit‚Äô after that shot went up haha,3
"Jofra""makes things happen""Archer",8
Bruh Shaw One too many,3
Shaw and not able to play bouncers.. that's why I wonder how much he will succeed in test matches.,6
That's how you take a catch Mr.U-19,5
"I love how Archer only puts in effort in the field for his own bowling

I respect that",10
"such a good cricketer, archer",10
Archer took Aaron‚Äôs quota of wicket.,10
Shaw is such a free wicket lol,2

Count it as short run. Has a big problem - what about when the non striker is trying to take strike. A weaker batsman/bowler is batting and your set batsman want's to take the strike. He will gladly have a short run just to face the strike. 


Also doesn't answer, what the bowlers should CURRENTLY do. There is not the rule currently.

The RCB curse is freeflowing this year. Any team can and will shit the bed randomly.,4
"Seems like bowlers cant take wickets so batsman are helping them in Sharjah , seems like the spirit of game is alive üôåüôå",10
What the fucking fuck?!!,1
Hetmyer looks like he just woke up from a bad dream,1
Hoping to see a close one as a neutral üçø,1
Stoinis murdering RR üò©üò©,1
"Stoinis already saved DC twice, today's going to be the third time",2
Pant is thicc but Hetmyer is thiccer,3
Holy Stoinis has been hitting some.,1
"Forget the dismissal, anyone else bothered by how poorly Pant has been connecting the ball this season? Yeah he shown maturity and he's accumulated runs, but it seems to me like his clean striking ability has gone for a toss. Today too, he didn't connect one ball. Worrying signs.",5
My sister reckons Hetmyer's hair looks like the fur of a skunk and now I can't unsee it.,3
"Stoins needed that bali (sacrifice), now see him go bonkers and hit 70.",1
What. The. Fuck.,2
"Stoinis, can you please carry this form into the Australia cricket team?",3
"I wanna know the name of that person who grabbed RR by their lapel, shook them and woke them up.",3
I've never seen Stoinis play like this for Punjab or RCB.,6
Dc trying their best to lose this match..,2
MARCUS STOINIS MEAT MACHINE,3
How much money you wanna bet no one's gonna upload Ponting's speech from post-match today?,6
"Pant even had Stoinis confused there. Stoinis wasn't moving until he saw Pant halfway down the pitch already, and took a couple of steps forward not knowing what to do.",6
"So far this match is showing how to beat DC, even when conditions favour batting. If you field and bowl well, you can create pressure, and DC will do something brain dead.",9
Capitals back to being Daredevils today,5
hulk,0
"Don‚Äôt worry lads, we can still lose",4
Pant‚Äôs audition for CSK was a major success I would say,1
"This is the last match at Sharjah for RR. So last win of the season for them, probably?",2
Delhi Capitals playing like crap this game to pay tributes to Delhi Daredevils,3
Delhi screwing up the hopes of playoff aspirants who aren't RR fans :(,3
[deleted],7
Stoinis is playing in a parallel universe completely unaffected by what is happening in this universe.,4
"Hindi commentators giving Gulzaar vibes : ""Unke jism aur zubaan mein taalmel nahi tha""",6
Should bring Archer now imo,5
I've run myself out like that once before. Feelsbadman.jpg,2
"The ball was barely 5 meters away from the stumps, how the fuck you go for a jog?",6
at least hetmyer is getting a proper chance to bat tonight,6
BC Tehlne nikla tha Pant.,8
Who is the guy that threw the ball? He looks like happy kohli. Such a nice smile,7
"So many runouts, may just rename this team to Kangana XI",8
Delhi getting overconfident. Good thing this ‚Äòloss‚Äô is early in season and can make them get their head out of ass. Too casual approach today. Ponting class incoming after match.,12
"Shimoron, time to -- Jaa, je ley apni zindagi (Live your life)",3
Stoinis why u no du this last year?,39
Pant deserves a good slap by Ponting.,10
Delhi Capitals or Delhi Daredevils?,7
honestly DC just the threw the game. RR not even playing that well. DC is just self-combusting.,9
Sharjah Royals back at it again,3
Lmao Pant was just waddling,2
DC being brought back down to Earth. You love to see it,1
KP having a go at other batsman for having a brainfade is bit pot kettle tbh.,3
Brainfade‚Ñ¢ from Pant,4
"It's the end of the over, the umpires call a time out. Rishabh Pant, in the stands, starts running for a quick single",2
wtf thought vohra was kohli for a moment,2
"When SRT first came before the eyes of the world, no one knew the sheer talent this one man would have. His prowess and skills in the cricketing field, unmatched by anyone else before or after. A very handy spinner, practically an all rounder, whose bowling abilities and the knack for finding break throughs were largely overshadowed by his legendary batting skills. The ability to see the ball in slow motion, the timing, the placement, all these things combined by how he took over the cricketing world embedded SRT's stature as the God of cricket.


Sir Rahul Tewatia is the best thing to ever happen to cricket.",18
So what exactly happened there? Stoinis took a step or two maybe. Pant was literally jogging there. Poor communication between the two and awareness from Pant.,2
Genuine question: How tf is KP on air everyday?,5
that ass thought......,2
Run out was Stoinis fault,-4
"Are Delhi throwing this, cause it's starting to feel like they're throwing it. All these wickets have been bizarre.",3
Lord Tewatia has bowled really well tonight,2
thinking I should finally change my flair to Capitals,4
That run out awoke the dark side of KP haha,7
This is dream scenario for Warne. DC falling apart yet Stoinis smashing.,7
"**First time Pant dismissed for a single digit in this season**

Every six you hit off Tewetia= teen guna payback by the lord. Be warned!,5
Karthik getting scolded by KP lol,3
"Run rate isn't a issue, DC was 89 in 10 overs the other day. Now they're 87. But they're 4 down.",1
"Two ex RCB boys out there, 240 confirmed",3
Decent run rate despite the clusterfuck!,2
Fucking Sharjah Bullies.,4
Kp bullshitting about running between the wickets ...,4
"The sight of Pant just casually jogging is making me rofl, that's some level of casualness playing in such a tournament.",8
Reminder that Stoinis went unsold in the first round of the auction.,8
Someone want to explain to me what exactly DC is doing? Did they forget how to run between wickets?,8
today is Delhi daredevils tribute match,24
"Some erotic stuff going on by Irfan Pathan.

'Woh keh rahe the No no no par unka jism aage badh raha tha"".",47
"We were 89 in 10 overs last match here and made 227 in the end.
87 today, will be glad if we make even 189 today.
Time for hetmyer to show his worth.",3
"This Talvar ad is so bad, makes it seem like a comedy",2
"Hold on.. Stoinis did kind of take a few steps. Sometimes its ""trust the other bastman,"" and sometimes its ""look after yourself""",6
Stoinis looks scarily buff,5
„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§,1
Karthik tries too hard to have an alternative view on events,3
Delhi are lucky Stoinis is in form. Their top order is throwing wickets in name of freedom all Ipl.,9
Stoinis biceps gonna increase by 2 more inches owing to him carrying this team,6
honestly abolish commentators just play in silence i can't take it anymore,9
"Is it really Stoinis, or Ricky Ponting is batting with Stoinis mask.",6
I've literally never seen a batsman playing without a helmet in modern times,4
KP sounds like he's about to lose it for Murali Kartik suggesting somehow Stoinis is responsible for that run out.,11
[removed],3
We need kp and warne commentating when pant and stoinis are batting together.,2
Never forget: Vijay Dahiya scored 40 against Sri Lanka at Sharjah.,2
"Am I the only one who kinda doesn't mind KP in comms? Cause he seems to be the only one to question things more often than just narrating events, apart from Doull",10
Imo KP's tik toks were cringier than David Warner's,4
Stoinis tears off the mask to reveal the face of the lord,3
Everytime delhi looks like they might be the best team they do something stupid. I can't see how they are currently better than mumbai.,6
more like dream11 cringe fans,3
stoinis looks like he 'bout to murder rr. god help them.,3
Delhi be like: Ee match devirge,3
Kaif be like - Tu chutiya hai kya?,3
Pant is just too lazy to dive. He could've atleast tried,-1
"I said this in a previous match thread and I say it again. The only WAY Delhi fuck their chances this year is if they self combust. Their success can be owed to the team firing in unison, but when they collapse they collapse in unison too. They need someone level headed  in the middle to calm them sometimes.",2
"Kevin Peterson's argument makes no sense. You're supposed to trust the batsman as a non-striker if the ball goes to long on/off. Otherwise, the player will be ball watching and not see his partner running.",3
Tbf Stoinis started running causally which might have made Pant to think ball went past the mid-on fielder.,2
Fuck.. pant was my dream 11 captain,10
Dream 11 Champion fans selection criteria- You need to be more retarded than Rishabh Pant between wickets...,6
Man.. If I see another run out here. I'm going to lose my shit. And I'm not even DC fan.,4
"Honestly, he is kind of the right. Hard to understand an Australian which is probably why Pant got run out.",5
Does anyone else feel that was not pant's fault? Because the striker (stoinis) usually calls for the run.,4
"Why are they not 4x zooming at ponting's face whenever delhi fucks up.

That is my guilty pleasure.",4
Stoinis knew that was to the fielder should've been a Stern NO from him. Still may not have saved Pant who had decided that's going to Long On and pressed the button to run,4
Win vs MI and DC is a huge bonus for rest of the playoff aspirants. RR looks set for a strong finish.,1
I hope its just me but tyagi's action looks a bit suspect. There is certainly some degree of flexion at the elbow there,2
Rishabh shit his *pant* tonight,0
DC decided that sab kuch apne samay se and went for a stroll between wickets instead,3
"Pant showing he does not have the temperament to play at the highest level, either rash shot selection in crucial moments or carelessness like this.

He has talent but needs to work harder and listen to seniors. Perhaps some time in ranji is needed to get work on his shortcomings.",3
"Players generally do better against than previous franchises

Tewatia and samson are gonna be beasts today",3
Axar at 7? Is it just me or is the DC tail a bit long?,3
Can Hetty wreak havoc today üí¶,3
Hettie needs to show he is as good as Pooran to get a bid at the mega auction. High chance he will go the ewin lewis way else.,3
"TBH more than Mavi, nagarkot I like Tyagi and Natrajan.",6
ahahaha Doully,1
"""Pant has been removed"" - SunnyG on national TV.",53
2 careless run outs is sign of complacency. A loss here will be good for DC going forward.,6
"Hitmeyer ‚ùå
Slogmeyer ‚úÖ",7
Tyagi has fast bouncers,3
Rabada will be disappointed with that shot from his beer chugging thic brother,3
Is it just me or Tewatia looks kinda like Lakha from Lagaan? The guy who is a match fixer at first but comes clean by the end. pic for reference: https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/anj/Lagaan/374006687.jpg,7
Tyagi seems to be a good bowler,6
"In my opinion, Stoinis should take at least as much blame as Pant for that run out. He definitely took a few steps after hitting the ball before yelling no.",2
"Mate Stoinis was saying ""Yeah nah"". Only we understand that.",4
Swann could definitely play andy bernard from the Office,14
Wish Tyagi had been playing from the start instead of Unadkat,6
Hetmyer is not hanging around is he?,6
I‚Äôd rather have Rishabh ‚ÄúChimp out‚Äù Pant mic for the entire 3 hours than listen to KP.,8
"NHL, with short hair like this, Tyagi looks like a serial killer in making. :p

Kinda like Perpendicular from Gangs of Wasseypur",8
Delhi vs Mumbai on Sunday seems like 2000s India vs 2000s Australia. Like you hope they will win and players will shine through but deep down you know the opposition is going to beat you and maybe rip your heart out too.,7
Tyagi has been impressive both games I've seen him in. He seems very focused and up for a fight. We need that aggression in our Indian pacers.,6
Lol this match sounds like opening up of 2nd spot,3
Matthew Stoinis has been such a great buy for DC.,3
200 still on the cards right?,1
"This is strategic brainlessness from Delhi. Sharjah is smaller, balls get to fielders quicker. Work this into running strategy. 

Also, just like fielders can cost bowlers their wickets by dropping catches, batting takes two to tango. Stoinis basically hit it 5 steps to the side of the fielder. When you're making hundreds of thousands, or millions in the IPL, figure this shit out. When you're just short of a two, its understandable as a runout. Absolutely no excuse for this kind of idiotic run out.",2
"Dare I say tyagi looks like a good prospect...

Just stay away from stress facture kid.",5
"Please do not expect a lot from rahul tewatia everytime to score a lot in less. 
Samson, Jos buttler, Smith! 
Smith needs to demote himself. Sanju is best at opening.",1
"Everyone saying Pant should mature and listen to seniors. I mean, dude. Literally Ponting is his coach. Surely gonna have a long chat with him later tonight.",2
Now toxic Indian fans will shit on Pant as if their Thala didn't get runout stupidly,3
Damn Hetty's ass is thicc,2
DC wasting tewatia's overs... he's bowling short and wide... How the fuck,2
Rahul 'makes things happen' tewatia back at it.,1
Wow this middle period is working out swell for RR. Denting chances of 200,2
Murali Kartik's team sucks ass,2
Tyagi has early Binga energy. Not as quick mind you but he has potential.,3
Anything under 200 on this ground is a crime,1
"KP speaking is pure Cancer, Jesus",3
Kartiks team is shit. Surprise,0
"Hetmyer needs to prove his worth today, wouldn't  be surprised if they drop him for a while if he doesn't fire now",1
DC doing a RCB today.,1
What is this line up from Karthik. He seriously picked 5 openers?,1
What a shit fantasy team by Kartik,2
Graeme 'Tewatia' Swann,3
Anything over 170 would be a tough chase for RR considering they only have 3 batsmen in their team.,-1
"Missed the Pant run out, who was at fault?

From what I've read Stoinis was on strike and hit it down the ground - should've been his call then surely?",2
"Bruh Stoinis could hit it for six with his biceps on this ground, forget the bat.",5
"Boy, our lord bowls well too.",3
"Pant does such a bad Dhoni impression, he can‚Äôt even let the other guy hit!",4
Hetmyer is so unfit. Potential 2s are reduced to one.,1

Seriously DC you need that 200 mark atleast,3
Hetmyer timing the ball almost as badly as Pant,1
Shitmeyer,2
Swann is hilarious,1

Champion stuff from Tewatia : 3-0-17-0 in Sharjah.,7
At this rate Tewatia‚Äôs gonna move himself and his family near Sharjah and settle down there,12
I just started watching and RR has done a good job so far.,3
"Murali Kartik is only a mild case of opener-itis. If Sunny G had it his way, there'd be 11 openers in a team.",4
Who is this old man yapping in the dugout rn? Show us the cricket lol.,-3
Tewatia is surely the most hard working guy out there right? He becomes a fielder immediately after releasing the ball. Gives his 100% every time he is fielding,6
They're giving Hetmyer absolutely nothing to slog on to leg side,3
"KP is the biggest chutiya ever. He shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the comm box. Not only does he blabber nonstop nonsense. He's disrespectful to other commentators.
Unpopular opinion but Sanju Manju was still better than this cunt.",0

üòÇüòÇ,1
RR in Sharjah are just so beast lol,3
"Kartik was totally lying about Padikkal.. if the order was random, why were the bowlers all at the end?",4
This match is gone if we don't make 180+ .. so better go beserk...,3
Altroz still looks like Tata Indica.,4
Stoinis got out of touch.. surely,1
RCB vs KKR here is gonna be a bloodbath for RCB's bowlers lol. Already can see them conceding like 60-70 in 3 overs,2
"Murali Kartik on commentary is so cringe... always using fancy words incorrectly, or misunderstanding things that other people say and getting mad at them.",2
Someone needs to tell Swann that the Altroz joke is getting old now...,4
Damn Swann took sarcasm to another level with that Altros intro,8
there is no way in hell any of these commentators would pay their own good money for an altros.,9
Andrew Tye and his slower balls lol,4
Filth,1
"Yes, do this Hetty..",2
Swann talks like Sunny G does every time he sees a single after a 6 whenever the Altroz shows up.,2
KP was shitting on Rishabh because Rishabh once rejected an interview with him,3
Swanny makes me wanna buy a car I can't afford. What a lad.,1
Tye was an MVP for KXIP before.,5
[removed],1
Can hetmyer score at a 200+ strike rate?,1
That six would have been a catch at short fine leg at the MCG.,6
Tye is just bowling dollies. Bowl yorkers or something dammit. Not just length at 120kph or slower balls. Must be a bit more proactive.,3
Finally a slog contacts,2
Good on Hetmeyer to take the pressure off Stoinis.,5
‚Äújakka‚Äù,5
Dhawan needs to go man he‚Äôs so bad this year.,3

he hasn't got that in the middle at all,1
Why has Graeme Swann become so cringe? Hurts to hear him in the dugout,1

Or is he trying to gain Delhi's trust by that six",0
69m .. 69 ... Noice.,3
"I cannot believe I'm about to say this but this IPL commentary team makes me miss sanju manju

Wtf Harshal is a better batsman than Axar! Who is making these graphics? Guy is seriously clueless putting Harshal at 11!,9
"Imagine giggling at ""69"" in 2020.",7
Why cant swann shut up?,1
Marc seems tired,3
Tye has a rainbow wrist band and is bowling to Stoinis,8
why would any team buy Tye? Surely there are better bowlers around in international cricket?,2
"Reasons why Delhi Capitals should lose today:

‚úîÔ∏è MI would stay on top

‚úîÔ∏è Delhi capitals, really? Worse name than Daredevils.

‚úîÔ∏è RR would stay in competition, good for fans

‚úîÔ∏è Smudge would be happy :D

‚úîÔ∏è Tewatia will get to be on the winning side again

‚úîÔ∏è Angry Stoinis would be in hulk mode against MI and we would love to take on him",-5
"(After run-out) Stoinis to Pant:

Ye main kar leta hu, aap Dream11 pe team bana lo!",3
"Swann reminds me of the old English team. Remember how England was knocked out of the 2015 world cup by Bangladesh? Morgan is arguably the best captain in the world, he reshaped the entire team and won the very next world cup. Literally an almost immortal team now.",4
Is it safe to say that we've got accustomed to the fake crowd noises that we don't find it annoying anymore?,5
What was the swaan altroz joke? missed it,7
Can I get odds on Hetmyer hitting a 6 with his arse at some point today?,3
Tewatia GOAT. Looking more like India's version of Rashid Khan.,2
We call them prawns mate,2
"I'll never understand why Hetmyer got such a big payday when he first went to the IPL; good 50 over numbers for sure (he'd had a decent junior WC run) and his T20 numbers are OK, but every time I watch him it just feels like he flatters to deceive...",0
"So the Entertaining Team RCB's match tmrw, be sure to expect some fireworks.",2
Wanna watch Harshal Patel bat! Had heard some time back that he'd smashed it around in the domestic circuit last year!,1
Swann is that regular at the bar who owes too much money and hence can't be kicked out,3
I just had a thought like why don‚Äôt they have a some type of fence on the side close to the road so that most balls don‚Äôt go out on the road. Also I think it‚Äôs a traffic hazard to hit the ball on a fast moving car.,6
Shitty umpiring.. Giving leg byes even before DRS timer is gone..,2
Not going for a review when Lord Tewatia asks for it should be a war crime,3
"If DC don't play Rahane against MI, that'd be plain stupid. Rahane has a great record vs MI, and anyway Dhawan looks out of form",1
"Thing with stonis is no mad swing or swipe over leg side ...There is method to madness..

Whereas Maxwell is just shitting for kxip this season..

Wonder why aus favour Maxwell or marsh over stoinis.",3
I think Harshal Patel needs to come in at 8. Hes been a good hitter opening for Himachal Pradesh.,2
This is legit a different Stoinis we are seeing this IPL,6
*Aree maaro bhai*,2
Lord Tewatia has been excellent tonight at Sharjah.,7
I know it won't happen but damn I wish we could get a Koach or even a Dhawan to come play in the BBL. Dhawan lives in Melbs anyway,6

"Stoinis out caught off (what would've been) a wide

Tewatia punishing DC for releasing him,3
Has the pitched slowed down or just DC shitting their bed?,6
"That's it, I'm letting Tewatia pick my lotto tickets",7
Delhi has been disappointing tonight.,4
Wanted DC to win for csk..wtf is this,4
Stoinis did his job imo,3
Worst part is he‚Äôs gonna remain the highest scorer of the innings.,7
"**13.3** Tewatia to Stoinis, OUT,  **109-5**

MP Stoinis c Smith b Tewatia 39 (30b 0x4 4x6) SR: 130.00",2
"Tewatia looking up and thanking God, as if he's not the lord himself.",12
Swann accuracy has been on point on dugout,2
Lord Tewatia takes Stoinis.,4
That is what you would call a 'soft' dismissal.,2
Praise the lord,7
I have to say Tewatia has been very good with the ball till now as an all-rounder . Even better than some proper leg spinners.,6
Is this the same Sharjah?,3
Biggest threat gone :),2
And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee,4
"Well its better to have this shitty performance at the early stage, then coming in playoffs stage",0
If Tewatia can finish this spell going at under 8 at the bowlers graveyard of Sharjah they should just give him to the keys to the city...,9
At least did not get run out!,1
can't even say the pitch looks tough to bat on cuz there's been all avoidable dismissals. 2 run out and all straight to fielders wickets.,2
Tewatia has made the difference here again. Huge wicket. Will probably cost DC 40 runs now.,4
oh no... that‚Äôs the eNd of DC,-1
Delhi resuming normal service lol,-1
Difficult to believe that Swann's lost his virginity yet,7
Lord Tewatia,5
Patel twins going to get dc over 180 here,2
Tewatia@Sharjah > Tendulkar@Sharjah,24
Game over,1
"Stoinis be like: man I am bored I just wanna go back, sit and daydream about Zamps",6

I'll take 160 please don't collapse tho,6
"This is why you'll never find cocky DC, RCB and KXIP fans",40
100% Tewatia >>>>>> Jadeja,9
Thas a long tail eh,3
Bangar enjoys dugout more than his coaching stint. I'm chatting with him on whatsapp.,3
"looks like a win is too much to expect from DC, atleast restrict their NRR ffs..",3
Exceptional figures by M'Lord.,10
Delhi look like they're having a competition for who can get the stupidest wicket,20
Will Delhi beat the SRH score?,8
Imagine misfielding from Tewatia's bowling. Yikes,13
The lord can do no wrong in Sharjah. Beware Delhi,15
"This pitch is helping spinners - may not be the usual 200 pitch. If we play smartly and get to 170 somehow, match on.",3
Going with 4 out and out pacers might be the best option in Sharjah tbh.,6
Can anyone explain me why Harshal is bought before Axar Patel damn DC pulling off a MI here.,3
Damn Lord is pissed.,5
"Man, 2 points lost is okay. But our NRR is gonna take a hit here. üòû",7
Very stingy spell from Tewatia there,8
Just tuned in and damn Tewatia.....Great economy,10
Bruh anything less than 350 on this ~~ground~~ park is chaseable.,11
**We are never going to financially recover from this**     ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•,12
Harshal and Axar look really similar with the helmet on,8
"With Harshal at crease, DC should be targetting at least 220 from here on.",12
Stoin is a gun but leggies are his kryptonite,3
"Everytime I feel like DC can string together a good few wins in a row, they go on to lose.",12
"Tewatia did that with the the ball at Sharjah against Stoin, Pant and Hetmyer. Big ups",18
Swann peak sarcasm,2
So they are Sharjahasthan Royals indeed,8
"Me to SRH after looking at DC today: 

Perhaps I was too harsh",12
It's like watching 2018 Delhi. Good runrate but pacing of the innings is terrible.,9
I just wish there was a way to hear only the ground noises without any of the commentary on. Both channels are hard to watch.,4
The game is over for Delhi.,2
A legspinner with a rpo less than 6 in sharjah. Rashid and tewatia together.,7
Someone should buy an altroz and post a picture to dugout.,4
Has Altroz's sales gone up? Swann is basically the major reason behind it if they did,4
Okay can we have Stoinis instead of Shaw as opener now if we are serious about winning this thing?,0
"Disappointed with Lord Tewatia, he should give some 50 odd runs in first three overs and take hattrick at last maybe.",9
"Thumbs up ad exist

Physics: Am I joke to you ‡≤†_‡≤†",10
"Was moaning about not having had a fun game in the IPL for a long time now, and someone in yesterday's thread said wait for Sharjah

I am going to bed now",11
"Absolutely love it when one of these old retired cricketers get the names of young/lesser known players wrong. 

""Rohit Tewatia"" lmfaooo",8
DC might be the first team to not get 200 batting first at Sharjah this season,6
Tewatia to do head & shoulders advertisement,9
2013-18 Delhi playing today,5
Wow. Avg 1st innings total at Sharjah in IPL 2014-158. Seems like they are making these kind of pitches for pure entertainment.,3
"Serious: Secret to extreme power is a big ass. Just look no further than Russell, Pollard, Gilchrist, Gayle, Hetmyer, Stoinis, Flintoff, Stokes. Literally everyone who has enormous strength has an extraordinary ass.",38
Shambles yaar,2
Harshal Patel was the fourth highest run getter in the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy. Not sure why people are losing their minds over him batting at No.7.,16
"Tye 2 overs 19 runs

Lord 4 overs 20 runs",9
Shalu kon? ü§î,4
"Is the pitch slowing down or just lousy batting? MI barely managed to make 208 (which is meh in comparison to earlier scores on the ground. Also bhuviless SRH), SRH 170 and Delhi now",4
Dc have made a mockery of Sharjah average first innings score üòÇüòè,6
It will be good to see DC lose. I think it will make the point table interesting.,1
"Butler just licking his lips, ready to bowl when ashwin comes",10
Petition to change their name to sharjan bullies.,9
Can‚Äôt speak for everyone but this ipl has been a god sent for me. Really needed a distraction this year.,18
Marnus could be a great addition to the IPL,10
Isn't delhi supposed to be the best bowling unit this season?? That will be put to test today...,5
DC single-handedly bringing down Sharjah's average first innings score lmao.,6
"Lmao Swanney

""Sad to see the timeout end, was one of the best ones till date""",46
Think we might see Carey next game if hetmyer cant deliver today,11
Harshal should hit out!,2
Tewatia is the new Sharjah King,14
Hey mod can we have a sharjah royals flair?,17
"Sanju will eat the spinners for fun, anything below 180 is RR's game to lose",8
Unrelated but do you guys know what the rap song on the Boat headphones ad is?,4
Which team has more young players Rajasthan or Delhi.,7
Tyagi looks like a good un.,6
Tyagi didn‚Äôt get  as much as hype Nagarkoti or Mavi received but he‚Äôs doing a very decent job after coming into the team.,12
Archer has 2-11 with two overs left.,11
Harshal Patel's is India's answer to Curran brothers.,16
Tewatia's having a better season than Jadeja,12
BC Harshal hit!,4
Fucking RR!! Sharjah merchants turn into peak Australia here,15
Tyagi bowling well,4
Hetmyer really likes that shot doesn‚Äôt he?,3
Clap 'em Mr Cheeks,6
Can‚Äôt wait for Russel to muscle every ball and top edge them to the parking lot every time when KKR play,2
"Lol, if RR are bowling this many bouncers and being effective, imagine what Rabada and Nortje would be doing here",2
Hetmyer hitting it off his ass,4
Shaw legit looks like a middle aged tharki uncle lmao.,7
Woah did he just hit the ball for a six with his hips?,14
"57m six

That should be practically illegal",58
"Watching this match between Nadal's serves, never missed a ball anywhere.",7

"7 sixes in sharjah? Dc u r drunk, go home",13
"A 57m six, wow, surely can't get more shorter than this.",14
"Can't bowl at hetmyer's hips. He thicc, and can generate a lot of torque to pick it up  behind.",9
"ipl has been a great distraction from all the politics,religious nonsense and news media",7
Lord tewatia >>>> Jadeja >>>>> Krunal,12
Harshal seems to have a middle order batsman like stance and technique. Tom Curran carbon copy,8
"I don't think the pitch is bad. Delhi have just had a poor batting performance, rajashthan have been smart with their team selection. Rabada and nortje will be difficult here.",8
57 m boundary. Fucking municipality school ground this is.,40
Who are they saving Archer for?,3
Tyagi i think is the best bowler of the u19 lot. Very impressed so far.,5
"Guy, how do I get a physique like Stoinis",5
"Trivia: sunnyg, if given the chance, would rename his son Rohit",2
30 runs aka 1 Tewetia short for dc at 15 overs mark,2
What's with Sharjah and DC today? Is the pitch difficult to bat on or the boundary size has been increased? :D,2
Right H Patel onslaught beginning in t minus 1 over,3
Idk why he is hogging the strike. Hetmyer should be looking to have Harshal at the striker's end for as long as possible.,2
"Iyer is such a bad actor, it hurts",5
"Who plays the best pickup shots, like just pure timing and no power?

Sanath Jayasuriya

Kieron Pollard

Virat Kohli

Virendra Sehwag",1
There are several bowlers who cross 135 but a lot fewer who cross 140. There must be some human limit that‚Äôs difficult to overcome that makes many bowlers peak in the 135 range.,4
Pant has the most believable Dream 11 ads,3
Bc even the 30 yard circle looks small on Sharjah,1
Rohit Sharma is the best actor I've seen play in ads as a cricketer. Damn he could be a movie star after his cricketing career.,15
KP calling them Delhi Daredevils oof,13
"Is 185+ defendable with KG, Ashwin, Nortje and Axar in Sharjah?",8
"In Heymyer dream, that was out of the ground!",8
Prithvi Shaw looks like Ravi Shastri,3
"Man this ground is so tiny, how did that go for a boundary?",4
RR's team selection has gotten progressively better whereas KXIP's has gotten progressively worse.,2
Scary to think that RR has achieved this without their lord and saviour Jaydev Unadkat.,7
"Trivia: Harshal Patel has an American Green Card, only reason he does not apply for American citizenship is because he will not get to play in IPL.",30
It was actually a great shot,1
AJ pie is back,5
"Miss hits going for six, smh.",4

who should rajasthan lose/get with the mid-season trade?,6
Andre Tyred,9
This is the worst ground I have ever seen.,19
Every now and then i keep forgetting that the game is played on empty grounds!!,8
Hetmyer why u no du this in rcb üò≥üò≥,9
What a time for Hetmyer to find some form.,10
"r/cricket daily meltdown update: 

Shimron Hetmyer: yeah bitches, talk nah!",29
Are they intentionally keeping the boundary short? There seems to be some space available behind the advertising boards!,4
Hetmyer is average,2
Hetty is back in form.. now I don't mind the shithousery we have done in this match...,6
"If I had an ass like Hetmyer, I would expect a rimjob everyday üôà",4
That shot convinced me Harshal should open instead of Shaw and bat through the innings!,3
Last year Andrew Tye was bowling at the avg of 77.66 with economy of 10.59,7
Bruh all my 6s in gully cricket are over extra cover what are these guys talking about lol,4
This Ceat Dummy ad is the creepiest shit ever,3

Who‚Äôs looking forward to Kedar (7Cr in the bin) Jadhav vs. Navdeep (phuck it boll phast) Saini,14
Harshal looks really clueless out there,0
Uncapped players are bowling well this season. Big improvement! üëè,8
Why tf is Andrew Tye playing?,2
Except MI I don't think any other team can enforce mid season tranfer only they can pay exorbitant transfer fees like they paid for Rutherford & DeKock as they don't need anyone so don't see any mid season tranfer happening.,3
You all are ignoring it but ball is following Smith.,2
DAE think Tyagi looks exactly like Tanaka from the Haikyuu!! Anime?,4
"Harshal we wont mind you trying to tonk, not grounded shots please not at the death",2
Tch tch tch. Just when I switched it on :\\,1
Csk vs RCB oh shit,5
Ok... I'm saying Heitmeyer is going to tonk Tyagi for a couple of sixes here. Let's see how much of a fool I come out to be.,8
"Tyagi's run up is like a slow mo Brett Lee, wind up like a budget Stuart Broad",1
Lmao the batsman just waiting for the ball to hit the wicket so that he can steal a run.,3
What will be a good score for Delhi?,2
Is there anyone who thinks Andrew Tye is actually better than Tom Curran,3
"I‚Äôm glad Irfan is back in the dugout, I didn‚Äôt see him in the last few matches, thought he got Bhogle‚Äôd for his tweets.",13
Faf would've caught that,6
Hettie rescue act underway. Not in full flow but he staying long is gonna make significant runs difference.,6

"hetmyer, hum par thoda taras khao",2
Is it a fair assessment to say that Archer‚Äôs the second best bowler in the tournament at the moment?,2
"Dayum Tyagi, nail those yorkers",3
Imagine getting a direct hit and getting paid for it.,5
"Just when I said Tyagi bowls like Broad, he goes for consecutive sixes",2

Guess who it's Lord Tewatia taking the catch,9
Tewatia is everywhere. He can be an asset to the Indian team,8
"Yeah this was coming. Hetmyer's ""sixes"" today barely crossed the boundary line. About time he fluffed one to the deep fielder lol",11
Finally it's time for some ethical‚Ñ¢ slogging,6

"He played well, expecting more from him would be expecting too much. Dhawan is who we should be grilling.",3

Lord Tewatia with a good catch,3

LMAO Swann shithousing in dugout,2
Tewatia who seemed a bit of a meme figure at first is now genuinely looking like an excellent all round player.,7

I would take 180 from here,1
Ricky and Axar mocked Tewatia last year when he was in DC lmao,3
150 runs in Sharjah is 10 runs to defend in Wankhede,3
Well Harshal is no Mujeeb,1
This Harshal is ‚Äúfinding the fielder‚Äù specialist.,3
All these Under 19 boys are excellent fielders.. great for future..,3

Hetmyer having his redemption innings was nice to see!,3

Is Lord Tewatia the 3D player indian cricket was promised?,9
Smith threw that on purpose so that Joffra won't play Ashes. 300 iq move.,9

That was a bloodthirsty bouncer in pain,7
Smith paying Archer back for the concussion,7
Smith planning for the Ashes already!,4

How is csk vs rcb the battle of the heavyweights ?,5
All I want to see is Buttler smashing Ashwin tbh.,4
I do get sadistic and enjoyable thoughts when Archer gets the bumper out,2
Archer seemed genuinely upset with that 4 :(,2

Lmao fake crowd is feisty today,6
Harshal and Axar are children of legendary Devang Patel,9
Really need to target this over here. Jofra won't give away more than 12 in the last,1

Classic AJ Pie,2
Steve Smith looks angry today. Amazing captaincy on his end. IMO he is the second-best captain out of the Big 4. CA need to make him captain after Tim Paine is done in Tests.,2
A wicket needs to fall. We need Buttler vs Ashwin. Please make it happen.,4
Why is he axar and not akshar,6
180 seems possible,3
RR found a worthy replacement for Tom Curran.,13

How the fuck did Andrew Tye win the purple cap,3
It‚Äôs just unfortunate for Axar. Jadeja does everything he does but better in ODI and Test. And Krunal is better in T20. I‚Äôm sure a team like SA would love to have a player like Axar.,2

I‚Äôve never seen these many beamers in 1 cricketing calendar year let alone 1 tournament.,7
"Maybe I'm biased as a RR fan, but Prithvi Shaw's face is very punchable right now.",4
"6 balls still to go, but Axar did a good job.",3
How good is Pye? Comes in from the bench and delivers a 50 on demand.,3
Man axar is so clutch,4
Axar might not be the immortal lord but he surely is a demigod.,3
Mohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma on the bench for Delhi. What a stronk squad,1
Tom Curran got dropped for this,4
Why is Tye wearing a rainbow band,1
That is some of the shittest shit gets wickets I've ever seen,8
50 for Tye,2
Tye gets out after hitting a quick 50.,3
"harsh, do something you coward",1
My ebony beauty out there,3
24 ball 50,3
Well deserved half century by Andy Pie,3
Tye is gonna be replaced with stokes next game anyways so I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried if I was an RR fan,5
"**18.6** Tye to AR Patel, OUT,  **181-7**

AR Patel c &dagger;Buttler b Tye 17 (8b 2x4 1x6) SR: 212.50",2
Noo should have sent Ashwin with Buttler behind the stumps,3
Hot Take- Axar>>>Jadeja in T20s,4
Jadeja exposed in this IPL but of course they'll keep picking him because he's good in Tests. Idiots.,4
Lol getting smacked by Axar.,3
Tbvf. There is no way we should've got 190 here. Stoinis Axar and Hetti great game,2
Can rabada hit?,3
Tom Curran has pooped in Tye's kit bag,3
"Andrew Tye was the purple cap holder once upon a time in IPL, he had so many injuries. Hope he gets his rhythm soon. I always feel sad when amazing bowlers become a ghost of their past due to injuries. Even Bhuvi went through the same.",4
Getting the feeling that Smith doesn't like Curran.,3
"was dying to see a Rabada-Archer duel, in both innings hopefully",3
Rabada????,3
Don‚Äôt think Ash is fully recovered yet to bat,2
Send Ashwin in you cowards,6
Time for some sixes Rabada boy..,7
Soon as Stokes is ready to play Andrew Tye is out lmao,3
"DC has great depth in batting among all teams and terrific strikers in the middle to lower order in Pant/stoinis/Hetmyer who can close out innings.

Even with a mix up like today they had the depth to recover unlike CSK or RCB who will give up and go for low scores quite frequently in such scenariios.",4
Tye looks like such a sweet good boy,3
"In a way this is ideal for dc, a loss here won‚Äôt matter much and this gives their lower middle order some good practice.",2
"If we were 5 wickets down for 110, we would have collapsed so hard, it would have formed a singularity. I envy the middle order of Delhi :(",3
[deleted],1
Delhi still going to finish about 40 under par on this ground.,2
I underestimated AJ Tye's bowling. I predicted that he'd bring up his half-century in 18 deliveries but it took a full 23 deliveries.,3
"Lol this has been pathetic bowling again, barring Archer obviously, though Tewetia and Tyagi have bowled well. This is going to be a repeat of the previous game mark my words.",2
didn't expect the first 50 of the match to come from Tye,2
R Ashwin is in bois,2
Tye auditioning for Dinda Academy,1
"Now is a good time as any to ask, why is Tye playing over TC? Surely some injury",2
Andrew Tye!!! Whyyyyy?????,3
Archer vs Kagiso is something out of a fairy tale,3
I want to see OSHANE THOMAS,2
Tye has scammed everyone in thinking that he is a t20i bowler lol,2
Now all our winning chances are gone even Tom could have bowled better.,1
I hope jof‚Äôs thumb is okay,3
That was a good innings by Axar!! Probably a match winning one if they manage to restrict RR!,1
Hentaimyer.,5
No r Ashwin,2
"I may be ever so slightly biased and may or may not have the benefit of hindsight on my side, but there is no way on earth that Tye is better than T Curran. TC has been fairly unlucky so far this year, and he's improved so much over the past few years and is now consistent in our ODI team.",3
"/r/cricket few games back: Axar Patel is the budget version of Krunal Pandya, who is in turn budget version of Ravindra Jadeja.

Axar Patel has the best economy rate of 4.57 this IPL. Plays some nice cameos for the team at the death. Decent fielder. A complete player for the team.",8
Just realised Axar Patel looks like Azharuddin especially while wearing helmet,1
One of the worst overs with a wicket I have seen,4
Harshal slog one for six,1
Why is Archer looking so upset.,2

Ashwin afraid to face Buttler. xD,3
"Well deserved wicket there for Tye, some incredible bowling down the stretch for DC",2
"Considering the fact that this is Sharjah under lights, Delhi really don't have enough on the board.",3
"Imagine dropping Tom Curran and getting someone who goes for even more runs than him lmao

Curran's a better bat too",8
RR as usual f\*\*king things up!!,2
Ashwin gonna hit Archer for 6 sixes.,2
DC showing CSK and SRH how it's being done when your top order doesn't do well. Well done DC.,6
Tewatia you beauty,5
Oh my fucking god Tewatia,3
"DD is 6 wickets down & Tye goes for 20 runs in an over, who in their right mind keeps him for 19th over smh",1

Wasted üòí,2
Lord is everywhere,7
Lord tewatia does not disappoint,5
Purple cap not far for Jofra?,3
Rabada vs Archer this wasn‚Äôt exactly I had in my mind but I will take it,6
Tewatia and Sharjah - great love story,8
the LORD IS EVERYWHERE!!!,6
Lord tewatia is everywhere!!!,2
Andrew Tye has played his last match in the IPL,5
What more can one say about the Lord,4
Rename Sharjah stadium to Tewatia stadium. He‚Äôs there everywhere anyways.,5
"Hold up, I just realised that we have Oshane Thomas. Surely the only reason he‚Äôs not in is because we‚Äôll have a long tail.",1
Tewatia is everywhere what the fuck,6
"Another Tewatia catch, what a hero

The guy bowling is ok too ig",4
Go to anywhere in Sharjah today and you will only see Tewatia,7
Ashwin batting at 10? is he only in the team for mankading?,2
Lord again,7
LORD DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!,6
RR dropped a guy who scored a 50 & his replacement concedes 50.,9
Floppy hats are the best and more players need to wear them.,8
SUPER JOFRA ARCHER,4
what was the point to harshal's innings?,2
The great Jofradamus can do no wrong,4
Rabada really has some poise.,2
C'mon Jos talk shit to Ash,3
We need a team with just 11 of our great lord.,4
Aah score 13(1) please,1
First non-200 score in Sharjah this IPL?,2
How can you not love Archer?,3
"Wtf is this management? Rabada in front of Ashwin, Harshal in front of Axar.",2
"**19.4** Archer to HV Patel, OUT, slower ball, on a length, 126ks, on leg, and Harshal doesn't get room to swing on this slog. Caught at deep midwicket **183-8**

Imagine if Ashwin got mankaded lmao,9
Ashwin to face the last ball!,3
Well this was about to happen after we jinxed it in yesterday's match thread,3
"Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck we lost a winning match due to Tye now we lose.I just wanna fuck off and go to sleep.Remind me tomorrow when we lose.Fuck I am gonna get nightmares of Tye's bowling.
Thomas had never seen such bullshit before.",-6
Another one for the Lord,6
Pisses me that they can use Vohra as a sub but not play him in that shit middle order,10
"Ok. If tewatia doesn't get the highest fantasy points in this game, fuck that stupid fantasy shit",14
Now this is death bowling,14
Jof 5fer please üò≥üò≥,6

Why is Joffra looking so disappointed after that over ?,26
Delhi will have to bowl out of their skins to beat Sharjahstan,14
Could have been 170,6
Buttler being the ethical guy he is refuses to run Ashwin out.,14
Why does archer seems so sad all the time,14
Hope Buttler comes up to the stumps just to talk shit to Ashwin,9
This would have been much less had they bowled Archer earlier.,8
"Ok Ash, we have less than 200 at Sharjah. It‚Äôs officially acceptable to Mankad Butler.",1
This should be comfortably chaseable in Sharjah,3
After so many brainfades this ain't a bad score.. 2 quick wickets at the start and we can be back in the match.. though need special planning and prayers for the Lord Tewatia..,11
6 rpo at Sharjah is god mode,12
Tewatia is so goofy. Wears the round pink hat.,4
"If we get Butler under 10, we will make a match of it.",2
Brb guys going to pray for jaiswal now.,7
"smudge can you NOT get out trying to play a stupid shot today? thanks, management",19
Swap shreyas gopal for Vohra. Vohra is an excellent fielder and gopal is the worst fielder in RR. No efforts ever!,7
This total feels like they just got bowled out for 100 or something. Fucking Sharjah.,12
"If not for tye, it would have been 170-175ish",6
DC at least reached 184 which is below par on this ground but we can't underestimate them as they have one of the best bowling attacks in this tournament,7
RR should chase this in 10 overs to show dominance,3
30 runs too many for rajasthan tbh. 20-3 incoming.,3
"Fuck Rabada and Nortje

Open with Ashwin pls",4

Can't wait for another sanju special,8
I hope to see sensible captaincy today with all of RR top guns at top of the order. Rabada/Nortje has to bowl out by the 12th over.,2
Interviewing the Lord.... Beauty,3
Going to shred a postcard sized photo of Ashwin tonight to commemerate the 1st anniversary of the 'incident',4
Inb4 Smith gets out playing a stupid shot again.,5
I will take 184 despite none of our top order contributing. Hope our bowling can make it a game.,3
Are we getting the sword slashing Smith today? Find out after the break,3

Any guesses how Mr Consistent Samson will perform today?,2

I want Smith to get bowled and look at the dressing room for DRS,3
Wow DC really messed this up. Not even 190 on the board.,2
So what happened to Gujarat Lions Andrew Tye? He was too good that season.,7
Why didn't they sacrifice a wicket by atleast trying to run on the last ball? Does it affect the NRR?,3
Tewatia you have been brilliant,6
"NRR can be improved a bit today, smudge please ffs",8
Good thing about DC is they never took foot off the pdeal even after losing wickets regularly,8
This is an underwhelming score considering the ground. But at the same time. RR's batting lineup doesn't exactly inspire confidence. They seem to be a hit & miss team. Let's see which side turns out today.,6

Wouldnt mind Yashasvi getting some runs, as he will be shipped out again next match if he doesn't perform. Ofc, it's wishful thinking as M'lord finishes off DC with his 100(35)-- 10(20), then 90(15)",2

How do they get the players to talk to commentators in between the two innings?  They have to know who's going to perform in the match that day already in which case this is likely completely fixed.,-1

Never waited so eagerly for Ashwin to bowl Buttler üòÇ,8
"how it is dark in Sharjah, it is only 5 pm there.",0
Jaiswal has been learning from the lord,1
OUT AHAHAHAJAHAHAHAHAHA,5
"Why is Ashwin back to 999 today, wtf is going on with this man's shirt??",6
CYA,4
It's ethics time boys,10
MEMES!!!,9
Ashwin got Buttler :p lmao,8
WOOOW,6
Ashwin 1-0 Buttler,12
What a catch.. Gabbar!!!!,7
Jaiswal is young and I don't think he has played this kind of pace before. Needs to calm down a bit. Try to rotate strike initially.,9
Butler is Ashwin's bitch. Fuck yeah,11
"Rabada Nortje Spinner Nortje Spinner Third pacer

Does anybody know how many times Iyer has followed this template?",6
Trap Buttler fell for the emotions,8
OH MY GOD I CANT BELIEVE THIS,9
Jaiswal looks like a sitting duck. Shows the huge difference in U19 level and mens cricket.,10
THE MEMES ARE REAL,10
Lmao,5
Loooooool the score is now Ashwin 2 - 0 Buttler,10
"""KG Rabada lgta hai aaj KG ki jagah Nursery mein reh gaye""

I cant stop laughing,8
Ashwin Wins,5
Oof Butler,5
Thank you Jaiswal!,2
LMAOOOO,3
Ashwin not this way,1
Totally grounded in his crease,5
Ashwin gets Butler every season,7
Fuck yeah Ashwin,7
Ashwin Buttler delivers again,8
Honestly they should grab Jaiswal and give him a buzz cut... will improve his batting for sure,4
"Fuck Ashwin gets Buttler, just not the way we thought",8
"*Come on Ash come on Ash*


I like that",12
ETHICAL WICKETS,14
RR are fked,8
Ashwin getting Buttler out. You love to see it.,9
"And r/cricket thought Ashwin needed a mankading to dismiss Buttler LMAO


Lezzzzoooo bc",33
Absolutely unethical,9
Well that's also one way to get Buttler out,8
"No Mankad, just catch. Excellent catch",11
Dhawan‚Äôs in the team for his catching,12
I'd have preferred a mankad but I'm not complaining,27
"Ashwin 2, butler 0",49
Did Ashwin just show the finger to Buttler,13
Ethical troll,7
bruh I thought that was jaiswal who got out and I was like why the fuck is ashwin celebrating so much... then I realised,13
"Y‚Äôall are happy abt the wicket 

But I am sad abt the missed mankad",17
"Jos was my captain, I'm disappointed",6
If Ash doesn't get you out at one end. He'll get you out at the other end.,5
Chad 'mankad' aswin too much for virgin Butler,10
Even sunny G is like Ashwin gets him one way or the other,6
GO GABBAR,1
Ffs Jos all you had to do was spank him for 6 so I could meme,3
"Ah Ashwin -Buttler, a beautiful timeless story",7
"And to top it, it's Ashwin who got Buttler.. lmao",8
33-3 rr incoming,1
HAHAHAHA,3
Cannot get mankaded by Ashwin if you get out to him before that. 5D chess.,26
[deleted],-4
"Looking forward to seeing how Jaiswal handles the heat here. This is a tough attack against which to find your feet. It should give some indication of the mental side of his game.

Especially now with Butler gone.",9
Butt knew he would have been mankaded so he didn't want to be on the non-striker end.,10
"A chance for Smith, Captain of Rajasthan, to show his quality...",7
ASHHHWINNN! wow he got Butler haha!,8
"Even though I'm sad, it's pretty funny to see Ashwin getting Buttler out",13
Moral victory for Butler.,7

RCB should be Liquidated for that Lifebouy Ad,10
Buttler's been victim of the most brilliant catches. Fuck this,10

"**2.3** Ashwin to Buttler, OUT, not the Mankad, but the more prosaic catch at square leg. Lovely bowling I must say. Buttler is looking for the big hit over long-on/midwicket region, but he gets the ball to dip on him, and ends up hitting to square leg, where Dhawan takes a diving catch. Out comes the thigh-five, and a big leap from Ashwin **15-1**

Inb4 Steve Smith loses his wicket again by playing stupid shot.,7

Just seen that Lifebuoy/RCB advert and don't know how I proceed with my life going forward,8
there goes the game.,0

Jaiswal eating balls like he‚Äôe been fasting for 34 hours,6
Just get the 2 points dammit. Net run rate will gradually improve if we keep winning matches.,4
(Somewhere in the dugout) Ponting releases clenched butts...,5
Sunny is your uncle you don‚Äôt want friend request from,6
Does Pant ever stop speaking?,2
Is this the same pitch which was used in previous matches in Sharjah or different? Bowlers now look more threatening,2
I remember Ashwin getting into a mankad argument with Steve Smith back when he played for Pune Warriors.,5
Delhi should prolly take the W here,3
"One more wicket in PP and it's match on... Everyone seems disappointed with 184, but this isn't that flat wicket to score easy..",2

Shikhar Dhawan‚Äôs so Likeable,3
love love Lara explaining things in the dugout,2
Butler is just a Mumbai bully,7
So I goggled Gabar Singh and apparently he is an antagonist in a Hindi flick. Strange I thought Dhawan would have a hero's name as a nickname,7
Lara too good,1
Looks like Delhi fans already left.,3
Jaiswal is eating up balls in the powerplay,3
Why is this reminding me of tewatia's innings,3
"Do you guys think it's been nerves affecting Jaiswal or just the step up of facing generally faster international bowlers as opposed to domestic ones?

Had a lot of hopes of him",5
Feel for Jaiswal but he's not upto the mark. He's losing the game. 2 off 10 in poweplays at sharjah?,8

Jaiswal's Idol is Dhoni,-4
In 2017 MI sent an unknown batsmen Nitish Rana in a chase like this and on debut made a 50 in less than 30 balls and won them the game. Why do such things only happen with MI!?,2

"That's it Smith, play yourself in.",2
Margins.. small boundaries..,2
Rabada is trying too hard to get a wicket. He should keep it simple,6
Jaiswal will either get tewatia or Jadhav status in next over,10
That was butt clenching Smith,2
62m is a joke of a boundary.,9
Jaiswal is about to shit on r/cricket. Give it a few overs,3
That Lady in RR Camp is Hyped AF,1

STAY ON THE BOUNDARY AT SARJHAH ITS A 60M BOUNDARY FFS,7
Jadhav: Jaiswal strike rate too high imo,5
Is DC wearing a different jersey today? How many jerseys do they have?,2
That pull thou,4
Time for a Steve 'Only hitting at Sharjah' Smith show,2
Akshar is a better option against smudge.,3
Still bad blood between Smith and Rabada? Saw a near shoulder nudge between the two.,10
Rabada's been off today,1
Man. That was quick. Steve Smith probably had a quick flash of memory of that Archer ball,6
"I'm getting a Ramayan ad on hotstar. Good show, bois?",6

For some reason everything about Smith screams Australian. I would know he's Australian even if I didn't have a clue about cricket.,4
That shot was not intentional. He wasn't even looking at the ball. Not sure why the commentators have to praise all the boundaries.,8
Jaiswal goin for the Dentury today,2

Jaiswal chanelling his inner dhoni,-2

Please drop Jaiswal‚Äôs catch whenever it comes.,2
MSD in a GoDaddy ad... Never would've imagined that shit Lmao,3
This has been poor stuff from Rabada to start.,2
Jaiswal is struggling against both pace and spin. He ain't upto the mark. Losing the game be here. His partners will start taking chances to make up,3

Who is that Justin Timberlake lite sitting with Warnie?,7
*RR and 8(19) is permanent sir*,6
Jaiswal needs to move on.. can't slow the game down..,1
That's more like it,2
Yashasvi lost them the game today,-5
"Smith getting lucky today lol.

This loose batting won't work in Test cricket though and he'll fail so bad!",2
Smith's batting is always annoying and ugly to watch. So damn fidgety it's distracting to even watch.,4
Shot ma man.,2
Nice shot,2
Tewatia incoming!!!,1
Tewatia 2.0 incomjng guys,3
Huge relief,3
Kevin Pietersen calling DC Daredevils really pisses me off. Daredevils was a great name. The best one in IPL.,6

Jaiswal finally gets one away,3
So Jaiswal might show up today,2
"I hope Ashwin gets back into the India T20I team. Can bowl in the powerplay, and the middle overs, and all the experience only makes him better.",10

Finally. Good for this kid,10
One of Tewatia's pupils I see,10
Jaiswal is reading this thread.,6
"Yes Jaiswal, that's the way",7

Why Harshal and not Axar in PP.. strange tactics.,3
Jaiswal finally into double digits.,7

Who is that Indian dugout commentator with Swann and Scott. Is that Nehra?,3

Lord sitting so graciously there.,3
Murali Kartik looks like a brown Uncle Albert LOL,1
"Yes Jaiswal, fight it out. You got this",10
That's better. Do that instead of trying to glance it down to 3rd man which it looks like you're not even that good at,2
If you wait and play. This pitch will reward you,3
Smith is giving me PTSD. His last 2 innings are difficult to shake off.,4
[deleted],6
Harshal Patel is just a faster Rajat Bhatia.,20
Bio bubbleüòÇ,2
Stoinis helping Smith,2
Does Harshal just practices slower balls in nets,4
What is this commentary,6
"I know Mayank is scoring well for Punjab, but I hope he stays and plays test long.",1
Nehraji and dugout. 2020 is really fucked up isn't it?,6
Rahul Tripathy and ajinkya rahane died for this,7
Smith wicket here would make things spicy,5
Someone write a Swann x Nehra fanfic,6
"Did anyone observe Ash walking towards stumps while observing Jaiswal. When he realized Jaiswal was in the crease, Ash just wiped his hand on the ground and went back to his bowling action.",3
Strike rate in T20 is overrated - Jaiswal today after the match.,12
Jaiswal gonna do a Tewatiya & r/cricket will end up with an apology thread.,10
"Nehra on Dugout, aigt I'm Gotta get out",5
Uthappa sitting in the bench : *one imposter among us*,3
Lol the commentaryüòÇüòÇ,6
Kartik speaks from experience.,2
I like this from Jaiswal. See off the new ball and than score the runs in the last session when bowlers are tiring.,18
Getting to 70-75 without losing another wicket can be considered a solid start for RR. They have the fire power to sail through later on.,2
What‚Äôs that boat ad song with iyer?,1
Lmao Nehra ji is being pretty frank,5
Since no one is asking. I am gonna go ahead. Wtf is nehra doing in dugout,5
Dropping rahane was stupid move by RR,2
Does anyone else here have cannibalistic tendencies?,2
Need a wicket this over,0
If 4 out of 6 balls are slower balls isn't it more efficient to call the other two faster ones?,8
Anyone who can stand being in a bio bubble with KP and Slats has the patience of a saint,10
hehe Nehra shitting on Kohli and praising Dhoni Rohit,11
Harshal practices the surprise quicker balls in the nets. Its said to come off if he doesnt shit his pants...,1
Nehraji - ye sab milke mujhe chutiya bna rhe hai,9
"Dugout is good, but it was just next level when Deano was still there üòî",12
Fucking fantastic Ash,1
That could have save from a boundary,2
"Me, watching DC‚Äôs bowlers every over: okay but where are the bad bowlers",6
Didn't even try to stop that,3
"Wow, That was rather awkward in the commentary box when Kartik turned it on KP & Slats",2
try to bend you big truck,8
Looks like the fielder didn't want to stop the ball.,11
Stoinis WTF,4
My boy Rabada went for 24 off his 2 ü•∫,8
Did Smith and Warner swap bodies this IPL,6
Jaiswal threatened a Tewatia transformation. Good comeback by Harshal.,9
jaiswal is r/cricket posterchild. His knock hasn't been anywhere near how much he's been hyped,9
what's the song called?,2
Stoinis is gonna play next game for Australia because he took his hat off when Smith scored a boundary instead of saving it,14
Lmao. Scenes if Jaiswal gets Mankaded,12
Lol Nehra,3
"Yeah jaiswal has been sketchy, but give some credit to the excellent bowling too guys.",12
"BC kya bowling Kara raha hain!

T: what the fuck is that bowling!",2
The umpire looking too stressed when Ashwin is bowling.,9
Nehraji is too lit!,7
"Come on Yashasvi, we are rooting for ya",13
Mankading opportunity when Smith's on the non striker,2
"Only three players who use their bats like swords: AB, Jadeja, and, the new inductee, Smith",6
"Nehra saying he is only understanding Rohit/Mahi's captaincy this year. 
I'm not sure if even Mahi is understanding his captaincy this year.",32
Nehraji english in dugout is same as us giving presentation ahead of class :p,8
Ashish Nehra should definitely be a Dugout regular,7
1-2 wickets and gg ez,3
Common Jaiswal today you can prove your worth,8
Sloppy ethical boy..,4
I hope Jaiswal pulls through. I can understand the pressure that he's under.,8
1 run over shoulder dislocate ash has chosen wisely now,5
Yashasvi playing a good odi innings,8
Smith showing Pant when to run,6
What‚Äôs even happening with RR. They forget this is Sharjah?,2
"There is no escape from Nehra. He said something really stupid in Hindi comms so i switched off tv and started watching on my mobile with dugout. Now he is there.

What he said - I am bamboozled by strategy of captains not named Rohit and MSD in this IPL (After Iyer introduced Ashwin and he got Buttler out). I don't understand the logic behind bringing a spinner when you have Rabada. He said something similar in their last match about Axar and Ashwin where Axar was MOTM. He even called that move stupid today.",31
It‚Äôs fine. He died last time he slid to field.,27
Lmao Pant Scolding Ashwin,15
Ashh ASHHHH,4
Is Virat Kohli's ego the only thing stopping India from picking Ashwin in LOI again?,4
If only Jaiswal can feel everyones support,1
why doesn't Axar play for India instead of kuldeep? Surely more economical and a better bat?,-1
That was brilliant misfield from Ashwin to keep Jaiswal on strike.,17
I'm just watching non strikers when ashwin is bowling now.,6
Ik it‚Äôs against the spirit of the game but we should be actively trying not to get Jaiswal out,8
[deleted],7
I'm beginning to think a mankad might be the only type of run out ash can affect. Everytime I see him he's slower in the field. Great bowler though,12
[deleted],14
Rishabh pant can't act for shit,6
Ashish nehra suddenly does much better commentary when he's in dugout. Makes me think that they stick to a boring script in the normal commentary and there's not much freedom there to express your opinions.,9
"They've got too many wickets, unless Rabada bounces back which is unlikely given how similarly expensive he was last match at Sharjah as well, unlikely we defend this total",7
Delhi's bowling is unreal,3
Strategic misfield by ethical Ashwin.,11
They are not going to bowl Axar again won‚Äôt they!,1
Anyone know what the song in the 6th over break before Ashwin bowled was called? very popular hindi song,2
pretty good run rate considering they have 43 overs left,22
I am feeling for Jaiswal.,11
DC fielding not good today,1
Man Aswin is so passionate about cricket. I want to be as passionate about things I do in life.,12
I think DC got this,1
As a kxip fan I feel sad watching Ashwin bowl so well,5
Harshal with that long run-up for absolutely nothing,6
"Harshal, do something ffs.",3
"I think this sub is cursed... Anyone who is memed here goes on to absolutely smashing innings and those who are hyped.. Well we know what's happening now...!!!

Please meme on SRH players bois... We need it badly",18
Give Sanju a chance at Sharjah please,4
[removed],6
Ashish Nehra special in commentary doesn't surprise you why Pawan Negi bowled death overs last year for RCB,9
Tough for Jaiswal. The kid is barely 19.,17
 Agree jaiswal is nervous or he doesn't want to throw away but he should try at some point,14
Need to get smith out,2
Harshal has been good call him whatever you may but he is getting these overs by without conceding many,4
"What a pathetic ground, pisses me off how quickly the boundary comes into frame anytime a batsman hits a halfway decent shot",4
Am I the only who enjoys nehra's shithousery?,10
14(22) is legit robbie level if he had been given a chance to open. Lets just admit he's out at sea today and needs to hit or get out,3
I think it's time for Jaiswal to go after the bowlers. He's settled now. Smith can anchor while he attacks.,2
"Me after each match that Ashwin doesn't perform a mankad : 
My disappointment is immeasurable ,and my day is ruined",1
Are Harshal and Axar related. They look similar,2
Jaiswal to stay till the end and win it,3
Harshal purposfully not attempting a runout to keep jaiswal in,3
Isn't the Jaiswal hype based on his performances in 50 over cricket? Has he done anything to suggest he's be good in T20? Genuinely asking not being snarky,15
can jaiswal comeback like tewatia???,4
Steve Smith is really babysitting Jaiswal now... India should thank him if Jaiswal turns out to be a good batsman...,12
What was that ball. Slow nothing bouncer is Smith's kryptonite...who knew?,6
BC give one over to Axar at least. It‚Äôs not like Jaiswal is Yuvraj or some shit.,2
Is Ashwin now worst fielder of India's test side?,1
"Good start, lost a wicket already tho, why‚Äôre they rushing it‚Äôs not even lunch yet.",5
"Even after 24 balls, Jaiswal still looks edgy while hitting :(",5
Harshal going less than ten per over is big plus for DC,5
Nehra oozes confidence irrespective of whether he makes sense. We need more of those in the commentary panel.,6
Jaiswal channeling his inner Tewatia,2
"""What a slower bouncer from patel"" tf you mean slower? HE ONLY BOWLS SLOW",2
"I wish there was a Hindi Dugout with Nehra, Sehwag, and Yuvraj",5
"Jaiswal overrated, just play Uthappa instead.",2
Iyer keeping the left arm spinner back due to lefty Jaiswal.,1
Man Rahane needs to go CSK asap,4
Harshal patel to bring back jaiswal in form calling it now,3
"wickets matter more in Sharjah than current run rate, ground is way too small to choke a team with low RR.",15
It's time Jaiswal,3
Smith 24(16) and Jaiswal 16(24) lmao,7
"Keeping score of ""scenes if Ashwin/ethical boy mankads Smith/Tewatia"" comments in the thread tonight",3
"Smart cricket by Rajasthan here. Gotta pick it up from here on though, rabada is still there.",1
"\* Hears Nehra ji on dugout *

*Fastest hands in the west*

Would rather listen to regional commentary ffs",8
"If any of the other younger players played like this , this sub would have eaten them alive",9
Jaiswal to do a Tewatia,5
I'm scared archer might take RR home today,6
"If this were Jadhav or Dhoni scoring 16(25), this sub would be shitting on it non stop.",6
Dinesh Karthik and Stuart Binny are the two luckiest men alive...,3
Okay so RR is fucked now,3
"I didn't know Harshal could bowl 135, thought he was just a 120s trundler",2
Nokia vs samsung incoming,6
Uthappa might not be playing but his spirit lives on,3
Chintu madarjaat...,2
Fucking beauty *chef's kiss*,1
"What‚Äôs happening, take deep approach?",2
Bound to happen,1
Catching will win us this match... Hetty boy :),3
What a catch!,5
Send the sharjah bully,6
I think RR are betting it all on Tewatia tonight!!,1
Hetmyer moves well for a T H I C C  B O I,2
Nokiaaaaaaaaa,2
Clutch af Harshal,3
"You can downvote me like before, but this is unnecessary stress on smith causing the dismissal.",13
"Welp, ggs.",2
Bye RR,2
Fuck yeah Nokia. And now we are back with a big bang! Sarjah Royals lol.,4
Jaiswal's first wicket in IPL. Congrats Yash,8
I‚Äôve yelled FUCK out loud twice in front of my conservative Indian parents. They‚Äôre used to it now.,32
There goes the game. Unless something magical happens. Samson has a chance to be the hero.,4
only Lord can save RR now,6
Yeah check that you fucks! Get fucked!!,4
No way that's possible. Absolutely brilliant,3
[removed],4
Harshal Patel runs faster than he bowls.,9
"Too much pressure because of Jaiswal, was bound to happen",14
"Buttmeyer! With bat, in the field and with the butt.",5
It‚Äôs out fuck yeah Nokia and Hetmyer you legends.,5
So Royals botching this match as well,4
Jaiswal 16(24) Smith 24(16). Perfectly balanced.,9
100% clean,5
This is almost hit wicket; push yourself into a corner unnecessarily,6
Out,1
Petition to get Nokia to be sponsors for us next season,8
Hetmyer thiccc,4
"Shit a 3rd umpire who didn't say **roll it back, roll it forward** ??",7
Can we get a bit closer?;),8
"Excellent captaincy to bring back Nortje, tremendous stuff here from Iyer.",12
Smanny hates the third umpires üòÇ,4
wtf is this slideshow replay,6
Why is CSK batting in Pink?,9
"The moment we've all been waiting for. 

Nokia vs Samsung",23
Curran might be missed here for rr from a batting perspective,7
Kid's not understanding that he's creating the pressure on the other side.,7
Clean as a whistle!!,1
"Is it just me or has the standard of umpiring, especially by Indian umpires, vastly imroved in comparison to the last few seasons?",2
"Reminder for RR fans- I think today will be the last game for RR in Sharjah. So, not looking good.",4
Lmao dugout going harsh on 3rd ump haha,3
Nokia v Samsung. Bring it on,8
Do they not understand ‚Äúget in closer‚Äù,3
Yo DC winning IPL,1
bc out hai kitna close jayega,3
Vry nyc deer Htmyr,4
"Win or lose this game...I am so proud and impressed with my team. After the top order and proven batsmen getting out cheap, we managed to get to a good score. A score that we can fight the whole game with. There aren‚Äôt too many teams I can say that about this year. We have come a long way. As a DC fan, if you didn‚Äôt believe before, it‚Äôs time to believe now. 2020 champs coming through baby!",9
"This is rough, he‚Äôs so young really amazed he‚Äôs in this position, but he‚Äôs a dear in headlights",2
Only Tewatia can save this now,3
How to hear dugout commentary?,2
Why is Swann being such a bastard to the third umpire. Let the man do this job.,3
Jeez.. There has been some good fielding display today despite that one dropped catch earlier in the match.,2
"Hopefully Jaiswal will catch up. 

Don't want to see 18 year old getting bullied on SM and then committing suicide.",5
Hetmyer really wants to see the Samsung vs Nokia battle.,8
NOKIA VS SAMSUNG INCOMING,12
"Whenever Rabada goes for runs, Nortje strikes. A match made in heaven.",8
Axar being saved for later is really smart. Let him choke the runs while bowlers around him take wickets,0
Why is CSK batting in pink??,6
"I don't want to say this but Jaiswal is digging a hole for his teammates to fall into one by one.  His slow batting took Butler, and now Smith.",7
Inb4 Jaiswal gets hug threats from salty RR fans,12
Jaiswal has some amazing tuk tuk skills,7
I really hope Tewatia does a Tewatia tonight,9
"Bruh Hetmyer was the last fielder I expected to catch that, after having dropped atleast 6 catches so far, all dollies. Shows what happens when it's just your day out there",9
"""We roar together"" text in the background. Very apt for Delhi this year.",9
Wait wtf RR have David Miller? Why don‚Äôt they play him??,10
Smith. (c) Hetmeyer (b) Nortje (p) Jaiswal.,4
Dc bowling!!!,5
Both sides are struggling. Feels like the wicket isn't that easy to bat on today.,5
"I hate to be that guy, but Jaiswal is putting pressure on the batsman at other end with his rather slow inning.",44
"**8.1** Nortje to Smith, OUT, Hetmyer. What a lovely catch. Nortje comes back, pitches one up, Smith whips this to leg, and Hetmyer dives forward from deep square midwicket to take this clean. They go to the third umpire with the soft signal saying he is out. The replays confirm it **56-2**

SPD Smith c Hetmyer b Nortje 24 (17b 2x4 1x6) SR: 141.17",2
This is on Jaiswal for putting so much pressure on the other batsman,11
These catches are the difference is all...,4
Hetmeyer is actually fat. Like chawla level man,9
Its not over until Tewatia says otherwise,9
We are about to see samson score runs in between the tournament which is a rare feat in itself,5
Why everyone's panicking now? There's still tike to make or break,1
Lol what‚Äôs Vijay dahiya doing there,2
Samson should have opened with butler,2
Smith needs to come back all the way for timeout lol,3
"What is this DC, they don't seem to panick, they are good with team selection and they have players who actually do well in IPL.",7
"Jaiswal needs to start hitting. You can't be nudging the ball around for singles when you're 16 (24) and the RR is 11. Tewatia's miracle knock can't be used as an excuse for every bad knock. Also, mind you Tewatia was not defending and nudging the ball around for singles; he was genuinely not timing the ball whilst he was trying to hit.",16
Just tuned in Ashwin took wicket of jos buttler bruhh,7
Get Samson out. Tewatia ain‚Äôt doing shit,19
I am so done with Smith smh,0
Jaiswal played one game and was dropped. isn't this only his third game? what has Smith done to inspire confidence in the kid? and why should he not be nervous??,7
Why is this Jaiswal kid looking so nervy all the time ?,3
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",13
"Some people here can‚Äôt deal with people getting excited over wickets!

You guys are most welcome to watch a funeral instead. I am going to get pumped if the team I support takes a wicket.",12
Samsung vs nokia time,4
I knew 180+ and Butler < 10 will make things interesting. DC got the bowling* to make it mighty hard for RR who relies on once in a lifetime innings to get over the line.,2
"Shit pant being trolled for his lose grip in an ad, noice",8
There is still Sir Axar left with 4 overs.,3
Release the Demon of Sharjah,5
"so, how early is samson going to get out today ü§©",2
Swiggy Jamun uncle is the real player.,12
Axar vs jaiswal will be the game,4
How is the new Twilight Zone?,2
"The mask will be removed and we will see it was Robbie all along

40(47)",2
inb4 Jaiswal is Unmukt 2.0,5
Smith's wicket is on Jaiswal. Someone had to go after the bowlers,8
Thank you Woakes for opting out,10
DC got really lucky with Nokia. Fav pace battery this season,7
Sher of Sharjah is here,4
Shreyas looks 5 years younger,5
Nehra walked in and turned Select Dugout into a roadside chai stall,14
Jaiswal needs to win this.,7
Iyer is saving Axar for Lord Tewatia.. 7D chess going on..,9
"What is this ""Nokia"" reference that commenters are talking about?",3
"i hope they hired some hypnotist to reset samson lol

*tis the first match, son*",31
Samsanju with another 16(9) here?,6
There is not even an intent from jaisewal. How is that possible?,3
Lads it's Sharjah,9
Short ball coming up,5
jaiswal needs to tewatia it,15
How is Nortje not a SA regular yet?,5
Nokia trying to reclaim the glory of the old days.,8
Nortje's appeals sound like when Tom's screech when his tail gets cut off,5
Samson should have opened with buttler,8
Nokia and Axar Patel have been our underrated MVP this season.. silently doing the damage..,5
"Shreyas is an amazing captain btw. Much better than that nervous cuck Rahul who becomes Jadhav when he starts losing confidence. I was baffled when he said he hoped he lost the toss cuz of superstition lmao. Probably the best t20 player or atleast among them but he's an awful captain who inspires no confidence, doesn't trust his players, is all over the place and has genuinely awful fielding set ups.",7
Let's thank Chris Woakes and his 'national team commitments' for Nortje,8
Hetmyer pant hahahaha. Two bootyfull men chest bumping,6
"Apart from maybe Stoinis, does DC even have any weak links in their bowling unit?",3
"RR has bowled utter shit ,mind you Gopal and Tye have gone for plenty.",3
Have to give it to Jaiswal.. he's in immense preasure but not throwing away his wicket,6
"""couple of big units there""",3
Lol can you imagine if Samson actually was selected for an important tour against a high quality pace attack?,6
"Don't mind me, just here to see Jofra bat üòç",9
"With Rajasthan's batting, the game was already tilted towards Delhi when Smith chose to field first.",7
Jaisawal is the imposter,-6
must feel so good when someone you bought for relatively low price performs like Nortje has,18
Big Unit chest bump. I've seen it all üò≥,5
Why on earth were they even checking the Hetmyer catch. He caught it at knee height.,3
Samson = Samsung makes more sense than Nortje = Nokia to me,7
Really feeling bad for Jaiswal here.,4
Did Swann just say two big units chest bump lmao,8
Manan Vohra where are you :(,4
"17(25) 

PATHETIC

Lost the game right there",-2
tewatia pls do your thing,5
Anybody watching the dugout feed? Nehra isn't getting any of Swann's jokes.,12
"If Samson can survive 15 balls, RR can win it",6
Runs plz,6
Kings XI and RR have become painful to watch. It's like the repeat the same mistakes over and over again and expect different results.,9
How good is this Nortje dude for DC this season. Genuine match winner,6
Jadhav is getting all jealous now looking at Jaishwal,4
150 clicks bouncer. Fuck!!,9
"I am surprised how good Nortje and Stoinis have been for DC. Without these two, DC wouldn't be winning those clutch moments. They are good players, and they have proven everyone that they are vital to this team.",3
"Tbf to Jaiswal, he's facing three world class bowlers",9
Can DC retain nortje for next season??,6
Pant is just anti-watson....whatever he does is not beautifulüò™,3
The camaraderie in DC team is so good to see.,2
I love Ashish Nehra loll,2
"Chill lads, Jaiswal is following the footsteps of Lord Tawatia. He is soon going to go bonkers and smash Rabada out of the park.",3
"Koach, Iyer without beards look weirder than Polly without one.",4
Ashwin Nehra's laugh is so silent,4
Can tye bat?,2
Nehra the impostor shitposter in Dugout lol,7
Nehra self burns. Those are rare,2
"Remember, before the RR vs CSK match, Yashasvi Jaiswal met MS Dhoni and greeted him? Looks like he has joined the THALA ACADEMY. üò≠ Before that he was the most promising U-19 star.",14
SEND JOFRA IN,3
"Rajasthan can‚Äôt even win at Sharjah anymore, and that too chasing a sub 200 target smh",2
Hope Jaiswal doesn't go the way of Unmukt.,0
"Jaiswal is gonna get so much flack if they don't win this

Hope people lay off him, he's still so young",1
Does anyone know the boAt ad song,1
If Nortje tries a bit he can try to be the next hide the pain Harold. His Crickbuzz pic checks out as well,1
"So if Jaiswal gets out without a big score, is he out of the team next game?",3
ghoomega ghoomega aise hi,2
Jaiswal needs to go big like Yesterday,0
This is the over for Jaiswal,0
Top 5 bowlers at the tournament?,1
Okay if Jaiswal doesn't hit axar........,1
Isnt Tv9 a Telugu channel?,1
Why tf are people commenting about Ashwin‚Äôs fielding when he literally got injured while diving for one ?,6
Man Jaiswal‚Äôs journey has been fantastic. He‚Äôs playing badly but I‚Äôd hate for him to get all that crap on twitter,7
Samson being pushed by Nortje. That is Cricket we love to see.,3
Iyer brings Axar in the 10th- This is what we call a pro gamer move,4
Am i the only one who's kind of enjoying Nehra in the dugout?,1
Axar is going to be targetted here.,0
Don‚Äôt buy boat headphones friends. They‚Äôre shit.,6
"As expected, here is Axar Patel to Sanju Samson. Yet to be hit for a six in this IPL. Clever bowler - cricinfo",1
Batting coach looks so uncomfortable!,4
Who is this Rajasthan coach,3
Wtf is wrong with pant????,8
"Nehra ji: all five of them are much better than me

Scott and Swanny: *welp*",3
pant what the fuck bruh üò≠,6
Even RR's batting coach is yawning understandbly,2
What the actual fuck is wrong with pant.,8
Who tf is the commie who pronounced Slats like sluts?,2
Wtf are those sounds lmfao,10
lmao Pant,6
Dafaq is Pant shrieking like a hyena,8
Boundary please,2
Wtf Pant,6
Pant literally shrieking.,9
Wtf Pant please stfu,4
Pant has gone insane,5
Fucking hell Pant üò≠,3
Oh my god get that stump inside his ass man pant wtf,3
I have listened to Nehra in the dugout for the first time tonight and I have no idea what the complaints are about. Really enjoying his commentary so far!,8
Pant sounds like he just got fingered,11
Pant‚Äôs voice crack on the stump mic üòë,8
Pant lol,5
lol Pant. Haha,5
Wtf pant,6
PantüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,10

Man Pant going wild there,8
Lmao Pant,5
Sanju da pls more than 10,2
"Tewatia was 17(23)

Jaiswal not too far away 17(25)

Expect a murder soon",3
Pant stfu honestly,9
Lmfaooo what the fuck was that throw.,13
"Pant: screeches behind the wicket.
 r/cricket: will you just shut up man ..",10
"Pant is fun behind the stumps if you don't take it seriously, like at all. Just treat him as a fun little distraction",13
Pant turned into Mariah Carey lmao,6
Bruh wtf was that üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,4
"Jersey numbers like 189, 267, 999 are almost criminal",4
"Control ~~Uday~~ Pant, control.",7
Someone mute pant ffs he can't shut his mouth,-1
"What the fuck was that throw, Ashwin?",3
Any boomer here remember the good old days of Lee-hesh and chest bumps?,3
Lmao pant,6
3 runs on Sharjah is a miracle,3
Nice throw ashwin,1
Pant lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇ,6
This is an unpopular opinion but I like Pant's chatter behind the wicket,55
Intensity > Intent,3
Pant goes overboard sometimes...,6
feeling Jaiswal wicket here,2
Ashwin is such a garbage fielder,8
Not playing Killer Miller at Sharjah is criminal,5
Why was Pant screaming? Sanju doesn't look like a ghost to me.,19
Missing Lee in the dugout.,4
The fuck was that Pant.. hahah.. Fucking distracted the hell out of me.,13
Pant got me ROFL lmaoooo,16
Fucking Ashwin. Lol,6
Jaishwal impressing Thala here,9
Ashwin should work on his fielding rather than being mankading activist,2
Samson so deffensive tonight,2
That was like a PTA meeting,3
Pant mic-bombing entire interview like a madman haha,7
Jaiswal playing 4 d chess replacing jadhav in national team,4
5(10) > 17(25) in a T20,2
I know we're supposed to respect this young talent called jaiswal but can he with all due respect just fuck off for now?,4
[deleted],2
wtf are these two doing,2
Pant is one annoying little shit behind the stumps,-2
Unmukt Jaiswal gonna get out Samson Soon,3
no intent at all from jaiswal lmao. must have supreme confidence in himself ;),2
OMG shut up pant,0
Did Pant just shout ‚Äúghoomega ghoomega ‚Äú to Hetty?? Wtf hahah,12
Nortje is latest in the club of non-regular internationals but absolute beasts in IPL after Dirk Nannes and Mitch McClenaghan.,10
MS Jaiswal,4
65 at 10 overs at Sharjah is just not good enough honestly,4
"Fucking forgot about it, why  have no one talked about Samson bad, Pant good? Is it because of 5(9)? üôÑ",6
"We love everything wadey says behind the stumps

We hate everything Pant says behind the stumps",1
Taking triple in this ground is harder than taking a boundary,2
Lmao PantüòÇ,2
It‚Äôs like Rajasthan switched from throwing early wickets early to taking it deep big time!,1
"Just joined, what happened to Jayaswal?",2
Ashwin doesn't give two flying fucks about fielding. The only Real Royal on the park rn.,10
RR is basically SRH lite,3
"Rajasthan with their 65 in ten overs.. and people were shitting on DC for 87 in 10 overs.. said then, it's not that easy pitch to bat on..",4
Pants high pitch bants is cracking me up,6
The bat was still in air could have been out if he tried stumping,2
"People shitting on Pant for being annoying, it's literally his job to do that lol",10
Can someone make a compilation of pant shouting? I will be happy :),13
Either Yashasvi Jaiswal will pull off a Tewatia or a Thala.,6
"Jaiswal is scared that if he gets out now, he‚Äôll face a lot of shit. So he isn‚Äôt hitting in the air and his SR remains shit

Edit: bad timing",7
What if koach was a wicket keeper?,2
Ashwin‚Äôs always been a mediocre fielder but he dislocated his shoulder guys. Can‚Äôt dive that easily,10
"ABD, Koach and Yuzi in a new ad, teaching everybody how to do fingering",8
"jaiswal shouldn't lose hope, even kohli was a hyped youngster that didn't perform in his debut ipl",15
"Amol Mazumdar was one classy batsman. Shame he couldn't break into the India side, when it was stacked with the fab 4",8
Listening to Pant on stump mic is... an interesting experience to say the least,7
"The way Pant is speaking these days it'll be just a matter of time before he shouts ""Benstokes Kohli"".",8
120 in 10 overs with 8 wickets is doable tbh,4
[removed],4
ALRIGHT KID!,8
f i n a l l y,5
Redemption arch,4
Terrible at mathsüòÇ,7
Whosshka whatta shot jaiswal,6
Oh boy yeah,3
Very good shot.. Jaiswal can surely bat. Just needs some confidence..,1
"Why is even Stoinis bowling, when all 5 options did great",3
This team looks like it could do with a gun match winning batsman who can strike at 200 as well as build an innings and maybe can perhaps roll the arm over for a bit of pace bowling? Idk like stoin but better any ideas,2
why bowl Stoinis???? Harshal Patel was bowling well,3
Oh god finally,3
Why,1
Boi,1
Yashsvul Jaisetiya,2
Tewatia mode engaged?,1
3 sixes prediction lets go jaiswal,5
What did pant say?,1
come on tewatia it! come on!,3
I love that RR lady‚ù§Ô∏è,-2
Jaiswal was planning this all along,7
Yeah. Fuck you Stoinis,1
Why bowl Stoinis!!,3
Stoinis should never bowl,1
Damn DC and MI strong asf rn. Skip the foreplay and host the finals already!,4
Stoinis deserved to get tonked out of the ground for that attrocius haircut,4
Finally my boi Jaiswal hitting,6
Smh have more faith in Harshal!,2
Chad muscular stoinis vs virgin Jaiswal,4
91M six fuck thats a big one,3
Scored 19 in the first 10 overs. Anchored nicely,7
That's it Yashasvi. Unleash the beast,4
That was loooong,6
Why is Slats talking as if the game is already over?? It's a small ground. 12 runs/over here is more like 8.5-9 runs/over in normal sized grounds. So this game is far from over.,3
This is not a hard chase. Depends on how Jaiswal play.,8
Ashwin Axar Rabada nortje harshal. Why bowl Stoin,7
"First six. Here we go

Edit: second six",3
3000 iq move Jaiswal. Wait untill the required rate is 12 and then save the match,12
Lord Tewatia needs to repeat his heroics,9
Everyone shitting on Jaiswal should realise this isnt the normal pitch you see at Sharjah.,8
Stoinis I'm sorry but he's not that good is he. Good little player but eh.,2
Do you need to bowl Stoinis ? I think we were doing just okay,2
"Mask off,Tewatia.

 We know its you",6
scenes if Stoinis get Samson wicket here,43
COME ON JAISWAL,7
Why. Bowl. Stoinis. Here.,6
is there an uthappa-tewatia line?,7

Sanju Samsoon ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,4
"well, fuck.",3
Lmao can't even score at Sharjah now,10
"Well, Samson fans, there you go.",8
Mr Consistent,8
I think Jaiswal would play much better if he wasn't this nervous. He'll just get better with every game though.,6
"Sanju ""Hit and pray it goes for 6"" Samson",6
Consistent Samson. Get him in the national team asap,19
Samson keeping up his consistency .,10
Fuck me samson is even more daft. Not going to get picked for even India A at this rate,9
"Sanju ""talent"" Samson",11
[removed],17
Sanju not clearing at Sharjah? H O w,11
Samson is mr consistent inconsistent personified!!,13
I guess Samson playing well was not because it was in Sharjah but because it was the first two games of the tournament,9
Gambhir - Sanju is an equal to Pant. Both scored 5(9),9
"Sanju ""2 innings"" samson",9
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Samson can't even score in Sharjah anymore, and his fanboys think he's better than Pant lmao",32
Pant was actually putting a curse on samson with those weird noises,8
"Lol classic Samson yet again

I don't wanna hear about Samson for India for a long long time",25
Samson lol,6
[deleted],5
"Didn't know who Amol Mazumder (RR batting coach) is, and googled his name. Such amazing stats and yet never got to don the Blue jersey. Respect for still being in the game _/\_",16
Uhhh never doubted you Big Stoin,2
Mid Season Samson combined with MS Jaiswal got that wicket,7
Lara you legend !!!,5
"What the fuck

How does one not clear Sharjah?!",10
Hetty boy is everywhere lol. Good going DC.,4
"People shitting on Samson for being inconsistent                           Pant- Well, Well, Well how the turntables",7
Sad,5
So not sharjah bullies. Just opening bullies. That's weird,7
Samson couldn't even perform here,3
Remember when people wanted Samson to play for India?,4

Scenes if Jaiswal and Tewatiya ends the game,2
"Pant is happiest that Sanju is out. Everytime Sanju underperforms, Pant‚Äôs position gets solidified",6
Shitting shot from Samson again. He is screwing his career with this brain farts.,4
"**Makes things happen‚Ñ¢** bitches 


Lezzzzoooo my bhenchods",2
Jaiswal is discount Tewatia.,4
Samson and pant both 5(9) so let's stfu and agree samson is more consistent at being inconsistent,11
Remember when Samson scored a 70 early in the season and everyone wanted him in the Indian team? Yeah forget that part...,10
4th consecutive single digit score for Samsung. Nokia dominating compared to him,7
Gautam Gambhir in shambles,5
All aboard the sanju hype train,3
Atleast Pant's 5(9) ended due to someone else's fault.,3
i think samson should become a specialist first 3 games player,3
"Brian lara at it again, remember even last time he got it the wicket alert right just in one ball",3
Oh Samson...see you in the next ipl,1
Lol even Sharjah can't protect him now,3
aiyye da why,2
"That ladies and gentlemen, is why Sanju is not considered for the Indian team. So inconsistent and not so good FC numbers",5
"**10.3** Stoinis to Samson, OUT, Stoinis. Turning everything he touches to gold **72-3**

SV Samson c Hetmyer b Stoinis 5 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 55.55",1
Well Graeme Swann just shredded my ears after that wicker,2
Samson tried to hit a vertical six guys.,4
Samsung doesn't even looks like he can bat now,3
A-haha-a-haha,2
Brian is briliiant,4
Stoinis getting this wicket was more important since he is the one they will try to target. I think he needs to take off his shirt to intimidate the batsmen more.,3
"Everything Pant can do, Sanju can do. Where are the doubters.",2
Should have gone for six,2
uhh can we get a tewatia show from jaiswal AND lomror or whoever‚Äôs next PLEASE. this is sharjah and you‚Äôre the sharjahsthan royals,5
Sanju (first game specialist) Samson,11
So it wasn't Sharjah it was just Sanju Samson's obligatory 2 good IPL innings for a season.,11
Where are those people who wanted Samson to replace Pant in the Indian side?,4
Again. The familiar Sanju fizzle out in IPL,1
"I feel slightly worried about the hitting capabilities of upcoming players like Iyer and Samson. Both can destroy spinners but are not that good against spinners. Similarly, Pant struggles to hit on the off side.",3
"Who was the bloke who said that Stoinis would get Samson. 

Also fuck, that‚Äôs probably the game right there. Delhi are just too good",6
Pant > Samson even though I find Pant annoying behind the stumps.,5
"Samson, grow your hair mate",2
"After the first 2 huge scores in the first 2 games, RR batting has been nothing short of embarrassing",2
Where are the Samson fanboys?,2
"
>Dilemma for Samson:
>
>\* Score in this match and get called a small ground bully
>
>\* Don't score and  the inconsistency tag remains

So Samson decided to go with the second option, nice",13
Ok so no Nokia vs Samsung today.,10
"Pant 5(9)
Samson 5(9)

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be",26
Samson just being samson,12
"Man take some responsibility for fuck's sake, can't play a miracle innings everytime. Play a bit smarty, take your team home.",5
Bangar the class nerd who grabs others' answer sheets to check why they scored an extra mark for a particular answer.,13
[removed],10
[removed],3
"Snaju-ji, WTF bro?",3
Bring Rabada back!,4
Samson even failed in Sharjah,6
Kerela man is overrated,5
Mid-season Samson is consistently inconsistent,3
Samson quota for first few good games per season is over,7
"Dread it, run from it, mid season Samson always arrives

Even tho he left DD in 2018, he's still delivering for us

Mad respecc",40
"CSK vs RCB tomorrow will be interesting.

Given that watto and Faf don't run over RCB",2
"Nokia always pick the top batsmen when he comes back for second spell...Morgan, ABD, Smith. Not a bad list of batsmen for a replacement killer.",2
"Samson needs to go see sports psychologists about fix his pattern of starting red hot in the first couple of games, and then going horribly out of form.",6
We want jofrA,5
"Indian selection committee discussing whether to chose samson or pant: ""All right, what do we need? first ball duck or first ball duck? """,4
At least Yashasvi isn't throwing it away,5
Have to go from here. 120 odd in 10 overs.,1
"Yaar such a bum shot that was 
Cmon he knows he can do better",2
"Jaiswal looks shit scared to even take a run, buddy have faith its not end of the world. You might get other batsmen out unnecessarily.",20
Sanju should have opened.,5
ffs sanju!!,5
damn sharjasthan bully didn't go big it seems.,11
"I feel for Samson, such a good player but just inconsistent.",8
5(9)=5(9),5
"I was at home when phone ring

""Sharjahsthan royals is kil""

No.",8
Angry Zampa noises üíîüò§,10
Awwww stoinis carrying Shaw ü•∫,5
After an exciting start to the ipl there have been way too many dud games. Disparity between the quality of teams is so evident,4
"I will say this once again because some people don‚Äôt get it and would keep talking about how shit Delhi was in the past:

‚ÄúThis tournament needed a better class of champions and we are going to give it to them‚Äù",3

Buttler or YOLO",7
"Jaiswal is getting so much shit here but he is doing much better than Buttler, Samson",3
"It will prolly look okay on paper by the end but jaiswal has ""single handedly"" lost this game for his team.",1
3 young Indians + Archer. This is DC's game to lose.,7
We gonna get tewatiaed again,6
It's Sharjah but pitch ain't easy.,6
Swann takes the piss so much at everything lol I love it.,8
Swann is ending that third umpires entire career,8
"haha ""surely they will go upstairs because they are paid per second probably""",11
Swanny has probably had a drink or two today,2
"Say what you want about how Jaiswal is looking, but he is batting with much better temperament than 90% of players would. Definitely more than an Uthappa or Samson. Probably more than Smudge in the last few games too although he looked good today.",1
Need that pant mute button,1
I'm worried Jofra will take it home,2
There is the Sanju we all know and love.,2
"Bar Hetmyer, and maybe Shaw + Buttler no ones really got going today for either side

Not a typical Sharjah pitch maybe?",0
Have they ever tried explaining the scoring system for fair play awards?,7
"Two lefties at the wicket, one in the shed to follow, Ashwin really must think Christmas has come early.",2
27 from 30 at Sharjah...atleast hit out or get out,3
Hitting Nokia and rabada is not same as hitting Cottrell. Get over that kxip hangover and show some fucking intent ffs,7
Samson comes with a 2 innings warranty.,10
"Still we will see a thread 2 days later 

""sAMsOn iS bEtTeR tHAN pAnt, wHy is hE iGNoREd ?""",6
Love Samson since his Delhi days.,2
"Can't understand people shitting on Jaiswal. He will ofcourse have these initial bad games, he's 18 and playing his first IPL guys.",6
RR and Kings XI must be responsible for bringing ratings down almost every season.,6
Swann ahahahahahaaha mad lad,6
Jaiswal is responsible for other players mistiming shots./s,6
Shaw just wanted to cop a feel of Stoinis' pecs lmaoo,5
"Saw CSK third, thought it was the points table and freaked, and then I realised it was that fucking fair play award",3
There's a reason why Sanju Samson hasn't got place in the Indian team. Despite all his talent he lacks consistency and always tries to play in top gear. He needs to learn to take the responsibility of anchoring the inning as well.,2
So weird to see a stadium in the UAE not in the middle of nowhere,3
First time switched to dug out...Holy Shit!! Swann is damn funny. completely enjoying his commentary,6
Lmao.. That was gold from swann,1
Waiting for GG to say something is pointless right?,3
I guess we know one of the matchups now! Great shot young man! Keep going!,2

Delhi Capitals is a strong unit. Strongest contenders,7
I want both Delhi and RR in the playoffs. I hope RR wins this one,1
Ash ignored Pant lmaoooo,4
Swann is a treasure,3
This is not the same Sharjah pitch from few matches back. It has slowed down. 185 is not as easy a target as some are thinking.,4
I think as we go deep into tournament we will start to see smaller totals. Its inevitable pitch will degrade.,1
"Even if Delhi loses this game , I am still very proud of the performance today.",2
"Rr is fucked. Jaiswal is not confident and losing them the match but even if he gets out now, they don‚Äôt have much batting left",2
Why does Samsung keep doing this?,3
"Not only does DC look like such a well-oiled machine in every department, but they also look like they all get on with each other and are mates off the field

Very likeable team",37
"185 is a very chaseable target at Sharjah, and a team having Buttler, Smith and Samson should be able to win this, even accounting for Jaiswal's struggling innings",5
Ethical wicket!,9
They're just falling apart. wtf,9
Lol Irfan just jinxed it.,8
It feels weird seeing Delhi as such a well rounded team.,11
y‚Äôall we‚Äôre embarrassing!! ‚úåüèº,6

Lol its just becoming **HAARAJASTHAN ROYALS** from **SHARJAHSTHAN ROYALS**.,4
Ashwin could be on hat-trick. He made no effort to go for the caught and bowled chance.,6

"Let's face it, since the next T20 and ODI world cups are in India, Ashwin seems like a decent pick. But he's so fragile, and he's in such great form, do we really want to risk him in such high intensity tournaments when we could probably get 25-30 more tests out of him if we treat him carefully?",6

I don't know if Delhi's bowling has been excellent this year or their opponents have choked themselves. Maybe a combination of both.

As things stand they look sure shot favorites to make the knockouts. Beyond that it's anyone's guess, won't count on them on not choking there.",8
Jaiswal finaly reached 100 sr,9

"Fuck too much cunts on this match thread. Yashaswi is young he isn't properly groomed yet, introducing him to nortje and an experienced Ashwin will only spoil his game play. Rr managers are a bunch of cunts for this move.",10
Not even at half way stage we can rule out RR and Kings XI reaching the playoffs. It is going to be a long season in the bubble for the players in those teams knowing they have already lost.,1
Hope the Twitter fandom won't shit on jaiswal,7
What has Stoinis been eating? Inspired.,6
"Jaiswal was given 3 matches 
In one he scored 6 (6)
Second 0 runs
And third this 
Now he should be dropped and Replaced with Vohra",4
We‚Äôre defending 185 at Sharjah and Rabada has been underwhelming and we‚Äôre still completely on top,4
"Ok, Jaiswal experiment failed.",-2
Rahane.. I hope he gets a gets a game somewhere..,4
How is he ahead of archer??,3
**RR**CB,2
Tye at 7? KXIP and RR are competing for the longest tail.,4
"Except that Sharjah miracle, RR can't chase for shit",4
This loss is 100% on Jaiswal. The others got out due to the pressure on them and he still does nothing.,2
Pardon my french but even Ben fucking Stokes can't fix this team.,9
Lord tewatia and Lord archer to take it over the rope,6
Curran would have 18 runs already.,3
Not sure even Stokes could save this team,11
Tye's first and last match,6
Eesh tye at 7 when you have lomror and tewatia at 5&6 is just bad planning should give Miller a try till Benjamin is back.,3
That haircut on Stoinis is abysmal. L,9
Saif Ali Khan is a pretty good all rounder for us,1
"If you gone for a duck, everyone will be disappointed.
But you just eat balls in a T20, everyone remembers and  hates you",6
Who is Rahane fielding for,1
Stoinis looks like Psivewri,1
"I see you Delhi.

Sunday will be fun.",3
Stoinis bowling like Bumrah.,3
Tyewatia,7
"DC team is ridiculous. As we go deep into the tournament, teams with stronger bowling attacks will thrive. So DC and MI have a huge advantage.",3
"Is Rahane the specialist fielder sub every game ?

I see him every match when Delhi fields .",12
"This year was the best opportunity for RR since English summer would prevent Buttler, Stokes and Jofra playing the full tournament in the next editions. Now it looks like they will be competing for the wooden spoon.",3
SHOT,2
Tye shitting over resident reddit experts.,2
So does Ashwin make it to India's T20 squad??,1
"Yeah, Stoinis is decent but Harshal would have got a hattrick by now.",4
"more of those, that‚Äôs all I ask",2
"Game: Select difficulty

Pant:",11
Clean hit. You love to see it.,1
"As a CSK fan, this match is making me quite happy. Now, KXIP needs to destroy KKR's NRR tomorrow and we need to somehow win against RCB. Then tomorrow will be the happiest day I've had in a few months.",4
"RR have an unbelievably shitty batting lineup. They genuinely have only 3 proper batsmen, one of whom probably has used up his quota of decent scores for this IPL. They need to bring in Stokes and another Indian batsman for sure. Play 4 bowlers plus Tewatia and Stokes as 5th bowling options. Gives the team much better balance.",10
"RR won the first two games before Warne joined the set up.  They haven't won a game since Warne is ""mentoring"" them.",13
The reason why RR players are so eager to get back to pavillion is because they have to create their Dream 11 team for tomorrow's matches.,5
"Mujeeb yesterday and Tye today, teams are in a mood to troll No. 7 these days.",4
"I hope YJ finds someone to talk to. What's going wrong. Is the move to the IPL so quickly in his career something that is overwhelming him. He's a real talent, and if any franchise can fully utilise him, they're going to win some games.",11
"This IPL has seen the rise of the new generation of #7 batsmen that'll take the world by storm like Mujeeb, Tye and Harshal Patel.",15
"Stoinis was shat by everyone before IPL started, never has someone proved someone so wrong.",14
"People are too harsh on Jayaswal in this sub. It's his early days. He's even younger than me. Playing against Rabada, Nortje and Ashwin will intimidating for every 19 year old in this world. He'll grow.",36
"DC = nooo you cant just hit six on stonis bowling 

Tye = haha six go brrr",6
Mumbai and DC dont even need a single change in their teams. The experienced players and overseas players must be feeling so frustrated. Best place for players to be is kxip guranteed play time,10
Lord Tewatia will save us now.,6
"YEAH. OK. I'll shut up. 

Fuck you time delay/Internet streams!

(Less than a minute ago I was jizzing over Jaisawl's pads. Now I heading to the drinks cabinet).",7
"Imagine Pant keeping and Sehwag batting. 
Sehwag will be like chup kar bc, gaana gaane de. 
Trans- Shut up and let me sing",9
How the hell was padikkal not selected for under 19 world cup. He is so much better than all these other under 19s,1
The only good takeaway for RR from this game is that they are back to being their consistent worst,9
I feel like RR is still in the game,5
You gotta be real shit if you bottle a 180 chase at Sharjah. It is like chasing 150 odd on a normal ground.,5
Why the fuck does Swann interrupt people with his stupid jokes while they're trying to say something,8
Just love Swann in the dugout. Him and Scott Styris.,6
"There was grip in the pitch today without dew so we were always in the match. Crazy what happens when you actually watch the game instead ‚Äúhuh less than 200, team batting second wins‚Äù.

RR wasted Archer, should have used him to finish the Delhi innings earlier.",4
Shreya Gopal has an average of 34 in list A Cricket & yet he bats so low for RR,7
Funny....Sanju Samson and Rishabh Pant scored 5 runs in 9 balls so no one gets trolled and no one gets compared by their fans.,17
Stoinis is definitely on some recreational drugs when he comes to play.,10
Stoinis has mushroom cut that every Indian boy had in early 2000s,22
"DC vs MI, ah finally a worthy opponent",15
RCB should have retained Stoinis. He did have good performances,4
Lord Tewatia is still there.,4
Tye TewTai close it for RR.,3
"I can't get hold of swann. Sometimes, it feels he is genuinely impressed by tewatia, but sometimes it feels he's just ripping on him for fun. What's his deal...",9
Rahane seems to be always on the field when Delhi are bowling. Is this one of the Ponting strategies to use his expertise on the field to help Shreyas.,6
People putting blame of this defeat on a rookie ü§¶,20
Stoinis‚Äô hair is disgusting,6
Big over alert tewatia gonna go do a big smacking here.,2
Why play the rest of the matches. Just have Mumbai-Delhi final,7
"Hope for a crazy weekend and stoinis best mate Ricciardo ending up on the podium.
No Friday practice means that could happen. Will take anything other than Ham Bot Ver",1
Tewatia = 96 runs in 1 over incoming,6
"RR batsmen to Tewatia and Archer: Ye tum kr lo, hm Dream11 pr team bana rahe hai",16
"Remembering legend Sachin who faced Wasim, Waqar when he was 16 years old ...and now we have a Jaiswal who looks nervous in an IPL game without a crowd that too .",-12
"I am surprised how anyone can defend Yash's inning.

Every player is equal. Maxwell or Dhoni scoring 33(34) is the exact same as Yash or Murali Vijay doing it",9
What the hell! Swann betrayed his lord by calling a wicket alert :(,8
"Jaiswal did put some pressure on smith, but its still terrible batting by RR anyway.",11
Tewatia doing tewatia again!,2
Why doesn't Stoin play like this for the national team.,6
Why do they never walk in with a good bat?,5
Jaiswal shouldn't be blamed for this. He's not a veteran unlike Thala or Jadhav.,6
"Why are some people blaming the RR Management for ""exposing"" Jaiswal to Rabada and Nortje? Lol. 

The same people were calling for the management's head when Jaiswal was not being picked. 

34 off 36 in a 185 chase, particularly when you're responsible for the wickets of two other senior partners (Smith and Samson), is piss poor. Youngster or not. 

Will Jaiswal learn? Yes. Was this a horrible knock? Yes. Is it okay to criticize him? Yes. Does he deserve abuse? Heck no.",19
"Tewatia building up, good sign",3
Abe Pant chup ho jaa,3
if i took a shot for every time pant said easy id die twice,5
"""Left hand orthodox against Left handed batsman is a bad idea"" was also an old cricbuzz ad.",4
Pant behind the mic is like that annoying fly. I would totally lose focus if I was batting.,6
"Stoinis' haircut makes him look like the stereotypical ""bad guy"".",5
Do you support Jaiswal or are you a bourgeoise,4
When did Delhi become so good,5
"I would rate Jaiswal innings over Jadhav and Dhoni innings anyday, simple reason being he was trying. Other reason being Jaiswal will improve with experience and age, the other two not so much.",5
Pant keeps yelling easy behind the stumps to let RR know how easy this game has been.,9
"To all the people who are waiting for Tewatia 2.0 should remember that Diwali saal mein ek baar aati hai.


T: Christmas comes once a year ü§™",10
"Momma Pant: beta maths ka paper kaisa tha?  
Pant: eazee eazeee eazeeee",21
"rishabh ""eazy"" pant",8
Tewatia bringing back memories with those dots,9
Hahahaha dilli halla bol!,5
Pant needs to shout just a bit harder and I won't even need TV to hear him,12
Bye tye,5
Tewatia has zero offside game.,9
EASY,8
Man DC is legit unstoppable.,6
"No One: 

Absolutely  No One:

Pant: Eaassyyy.",13
Axar boundaries conceded count: 3 in 16 overs.,7
Bye bye Tye..,2
Why can't they clear this ground?,6
Perfect.,1
omfg shaw keep it in ur pants m8,13
People who shit on Axar Patel and call him just a dart thrower are utter idiots.,3
Here's your Tye Tye Phis joke,11
Rr get ur shit together!!!!! Dc will overtake mi in nrr you fucking imbeciles,9
It's not sharjah it's rr,6
"Rabada‚Äôs smile though fuck, deserved",5
Delhi's catching has been top notch today,2
Lmao Prithvi climbing on Rabada like a kid,3
Big Joff and the Lawrd going to pull it off here...,2
Axar *Economical* Patel,6
"Rabada, what a beauty. That catch was ok too.",2
Can Tewatia not play spin at all ?,1
"Finally two big forces in this ipl will be at crease :""v",2
no one's gonna shit on tewatia even if he lets go a maiden here.,3
"Aur ye kar di tay tay fiss. 

Yeah i said it:/",1
So RR losing today will be a relief for bottom table teams i guess. Makes the points more equal,2
why isnt stokes playing,2
"Tye, gg bro.",2
"RR players aren't throwing their wickets away, they're just tired of the Pant shit talk behind the stumps and can't take it anymore.",10
The run rate boost is gonna be big for delhi,2
"If you still think RR has a chance, you haven‚Äôt been watching closely enough.",2
"Feel sorry for Smith. He let a trophy slip through his hands in 2017 for rps, and now he's been in bad form and seeing his team with massive defeats after a promising start to the tournament. Came back after the humiliation of sandpaper gate. Got absolutely whacked by England in the semi finals in CWC 2019. Just narrowly managed to retain the urn in the ashes but due to a draw after Stokes snatched the game from them. Got bamboozled by Archer.",10
Sleazy Pant.,1
"Finally Archer will come to bat, why was Tye send ahead of him",4
Prithvi Shaw has a fetish of jumping on people,4
"**13.5** AR Patel to Tye, OUT,  **90-6**

I think these two teams are the best in this year's IPL. Sunday is going to be amazing.",7

You can't blame jaiswal here. Also keep in mind he took a wicket,3
Ceat tye's sulking timeout,6
"Does RR have the worst battling line up in this IPL? Only Smith and Buttler are the two legit international tier batsmen. There are either a bunch of kids, 2nd tier Indian talent, or Samson",3
RR and KXIP eat at the same table.,7
Wish Strategic Timeouts didn‚Äôt exist.,6
Pant pleading spinners to go easy on finishers,5
Are the pitches just bad that is the reason why second innings teams struggle to chase ? Pitches slow down second innings every game,2
RR batsmen are probably throwing their wickets away because of Pant's easy easy easy,13
[deleted],5
Lord waiting for Rabada?,6
Prithvi Shaw jumping in Rabada‚Äôs lap lol,7
I am losing interest in this IPL. Too many one sided affairs since that super over between MI and RCB.,9
You know your team is shit when top 6 batsmen cannot even make 100 runs collectively in Sharjah.,9

Ponting making Rahane feel useful like my boss made me feel useful in the team.,7

THIS IS A YOKE,5
"Spinners thriving in these grounds. 

Saeed Ajmal smiling in distance",6
Now they are not doing well even in Sharjah,9
DC fielders eating these catches like tic-tacs,8
"Why RR not tried Uthappa as opener yet, he gave many good starts for KKR in the past?",2
"As someone who supports MI and DC, this IPL feels like a dream",5
"T20 Stokes isn't that good, I hope RR isn't looking at him to solve all their problems",6
The go compare lore is becoming too much to keep up with at this point,2
"If DC wins, I am going to get Rs.110 discount on my online chicken order from Fresh to home. Already have Rs.50 discount from y'days correct prediction",11
Axar 'Daniel Vettori' Patel,4
We have to fuck up MI too for the non believers to believe what a big upset that ‚Äúvoodoo win involving Bhuvi sacrifice‚Äù by SRH was.,6
See what happens when you pick Andrew pie over tom 'pie chucker' Curran. You lose a valuable batsmen,11
"I haven't seen enough people talking about Axar, excellent bowling from him this whole IPL",6
How tf did dc actually lose a game?,9
Can't wait for MI vs DC,13
CSK lost to these bottlers lmao.,16
"As a newcomer to the IPL I thought RR would be fun to watch with Smith, Buttler and Archer.. Why are they so bad?!",15
"Pant going in during sex:

**EASYEASYEASY**",44
[deleted],3
Would love it if Axar magically became a gun test match all rounder so we didn't have to stress about finding a replacement for Jadeja and Ashwin.,6
I would be quite happy with DC going all the way in this edition of IPL (inspite of me being a kkr fan). Really one of the most likeable teams around with some of the best young talents.,7

 What happens to the player who came as replacement when the injured player returns in the next season?,2
KXIP and RR - 2 teams showed great promise initially and went downhill.,4
"Feel bad for RR. 

At least pull off a CSK and improve NRR now",9
It was a good hunting ground for Royals. DC is a different beast this year though.,7
Pant man what a guy,5
"What's better, Pant's eazeeee or 3rd umpire's NYC and slow?",13
"Fuck this shit, I'd better watch djokovic",11
"If you want Delhi to lose, make them win the toss",10
"The real lord is lord Axar but because he goes about his work without too much fuss, he does not get the attention. 

And then folks also complain that I go overboard with my celebrations. You have to my friends, the world works like that!",3
This is some kxip level shit,2
and they just had to bring in andrew tye over curran for this match.. what was the logic,2
Delhi have 11 match winners. Rajasthan have 3. There's your difference.,9
Finally RR's two best batsmen at the crease,2
Remove Smith/Kohli from captainship n Zinta from ownership & you will see all 3 teams flourish.,6
Honestly pant could do nothing with the bat and i wont mind it if he continues his antics behind the stumps,11
There are 2 many advertisements. What the hell.,4
Orgasm of one particular player(won't take name):ez ezzee ezzzzzeeeee,3

"hate the special OPS ad on Hotstar, its so loud and annoying and pointless",2
"I'm not going to defend jaiswal after all this. He wasted 5 overs playing absolute shit. If it was anyone else you guys would have killed them. He also contributed to the pressure on rr as a whole. It was a shit performance by him even though he was put in a position he was comfortable in. First getting out 0(2) against mumbai and now this isn't excusable. I hope this sub can get off the jaiswal train because there are plenty of other youngsters who are showing their worth :- kishan,shreyas,mayank,paddikal,prithvi,mavi,nagarkoti,etc",8

Ashwin and Axar>>>Chahar and Krunal.

can tewatia do a tewatia?,7
"I‚Äôm sure RR won‚Äôt win, but some Tewatia sixes will be fun",4
"Gopal should ask Tewatia to retire, bring out the rage within him...",6
Rabada keeps his at least 1 wicket each match streak.,4
Pretty good catch from Iyer as well. Definitely wasn't easy.,1
Is this Sharjah?!,8
Sharjah to Dubai and Abu Dhabi : well well how the turntables,7
Bruh they struggling to get to 150 here,3
DC's early batting collapse would seem worthwhile now if that has brought Hetmyer into form.,6
"That's why, Smith needed to save his wicket. To prevent this mindless collapse.",9
Are those Rahul chants?,3
Field settings are so good,5
RR making Harshal Patel look peak McGrath,16
I wish Royals were called Reyals so that it would read Slayer backwards.,4
Tewetia doing the Sachin head nod. It's on!,1
"Twas against KXIP , DC shall not let you pass Lord T",2
Atleast hit HP dude. Smh,4

Now they need 2017 stokes,3

DC this year literally talking shit to everyone - ‚Äú Pichli baar kya bola tha? AUKAAT!!‚Äù,5
Lord took the pants of his village kid rabada.,1
Why you first naming rabada for sir,1
 Has Manan Vohra completel\[y lost touch with the bat? He can open and he should for RR. They should get somone else to replace Lomror and Gopal and if Stokes returns then he comes in for Tye/Curran. But dropping Curran was crazy.,7
If Delhi doesn't win this year's IPL trophy with this team then i don't think they ever will.,8
In hindsight.. Slats was totally right when he talked like the match was over around the 11th over. I know Tewatia is still there. But 17/over should be too much.,3
"As much as I want to see Tewatia do it again and not be a one hit wonder, we have to remember that it was absolutely awful bowling from Cotrell that helped him.

Considering how tiny the outfields are, he still has a chance but any half decent bowling will not let that happen.",4
Did he throw it to Tewatia lol,2
thiccbada,4
Yeah tewatia is a one hit wonder,4
The last time RR lost four matches consecutive in the same season was in 2012 (L4) with the last two losses coming against none other than DD/DC.,2
"https://twitter.com/ArshIftikhar/status/1314613695993970689?s=19

Jeez Rabada. Don't get yourself injured trying to get tewatia out. No offence,11
"Oof Kagiso, don't get injured",4
What‚Äôs the point of stokes coming now ? Might as well stay and look after his dad,3
Tewatia before second innings- Batsmen should play some positive cricket. RR Batsmen- Well now we won't do it,4
Tewatia and Harshal are battling for No. 1 Haryana All Rounder in the absence of Double Centurion Mishraji.,11
This more game per game malarkey is going to make me watch all matches on mute.,1

"Archer to KG: 2* runs from 3 Balls

KG to Archer: 1 run from 2 Balls.

Hence proved, KG >>>>>> Archer",4
Just mute these commentators and let me listen to Pant,10
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all up to Rahul Tewtia‚Äô isn‚Äôt something which instills you with much confidence,7
Why is Gavaskar is still trying to hype this? RR lost this some time ago.,10
Scenes if Tewatia gets out,1
Whose idea was to have Tye instead of Curran. F\*\*k him,5
How the hell was that a wide?,1
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all up to Rahul Tewtia‚Äô isn‚Äôt something which you want to hear...,3

I thought Delhi would fancy joining us northern bros aka Rajasthan and Punjab at the bottom of the pile but clearly not,4
"No close matches this whole week, bring in the script writers.",8
Guys tewatia Is just warming up. He needs to get his strike rate below 50 before he can go bang bang...,15
"RR have hit 4 sixes till now. 2 by Jaiswal, and 1 each by Smith and Tye.",7
I like how good a slap this is to people who thought Delhi is going to do an old Delhi.,13
How good has Harshal Patel become? Swear he used to be absolutely slammed but here he is bowling great lines and lengths to in form batsmen and not letting them get away with it.,25
Pant kinda thicc tho ?,9
"It's good to have bowlers who can bat but it can't start from number 6 ffs 
RR is doing weird shit.",3
Hope Kohli never listens to Pant‚Äôs DRS requests,6
"MI and DC finale... We are inevitable. 

Even year curse vs pressure chokers",20
"Dread it, run from it, CSK will sneak into the top four because of NRR",15
You have angered the lord with that fielding,5
The contribution by both the Patel's should not go unnoticed both with the ball and bat,7
DC so good. Hard not to like. The only worry is that if they win the entire thing we will be stuck with Karnatakememey XI Punjab with 0 titles,11
Patel helping out patel,10
"My word, Delhi seem on POINT",7
excited to see morris tomorrow,5
Looks like Sharjah was not lucky for RR after all,10
Axar is the purest Gujju rockstar our game has. Cannot hate him,6

Tf are these fielding efforts. So much has changed in the last 5 years,5
What happens after we crush MI too? You guys finally wake up from your dream of MI being strong lol.,-3
Axar Patel looks like Arsenal Ozil and performs like Real Madrid Ozil,12
Delhi and Mumbai have solid team. Always someone standing up when others fail.,6
Axar giving Tewatia no chances to demand any off field awards tonight,5
"SRH sneaked with 6 wins last year. So I think the battle of the 4th position will be between RCB, CSK and SRH.",3
Wasn't Axar memed to death in the previous seasons? He's a beast now,10
The Lord couldn't possibly do it against Rabada could he? He does work in mysterious ways after all....,6
Oh come on i know even delhi capital fans want to see a lord tewatia,6
"With enough wins on board, DC should consider resting one of the openers and getting Rahane in.",2
Delhi and Mumbai have always been even HoH right?,3
[removed],4
"81 off 27 Axar didn't need to save that four, shows passion imo.",9
Ah. If RR pulls this off I'll commit die,3
Wtf is up with all this wholesome music when they should tomorrow‚Äôs matches? We want the HYPE IPL MUSIC,3

"Might be a bit early to call, but collapse of the week award contenders are

Special mention to middle order collapses from CSK, SRH",2

I dare say... This is by far the best catching by a team I have seen in a long long time.. outstanding!,2

Not the first time someone from Delhi invaded Rajasthan's fortress,8

Utter time waste.. Some of these third umpires jist take more time to show they are adding some value,3
Need 16 4s to win easy,4
RR doesn‚Äôt deserve lord Tewatia,7
Where are these cameras located to provide these weird angles? Is it spider cam or because of the weird dimesnsions of the ground?,3
Dugout commentators were not having it,2
Third umpire was really interested in Hetmayer's ....... catch.,4
Man DC is just too OP at this point of time. I think a reality check of some sorts before the playoffs would be good for us.,2
Who's gonna win tomorrow? Kxip v kkr,1
Bloody hell that took forever,2
Can‚Äôt really fault the third umpire. Those are bad angles,3
"**17.2** HV Patel to Gopal, OUT, Hetmyer you beautiful beautiful fielder. His second stunning diving catch in the deep. Gopal makes room to loft this length ball inside out.

RR have now lost 4 games in a row after their consecutive wins to start off the IPL. (Assuming Lord Tewatia doesn't pull the rabbit out of the hat this time),6
I honestly think RR is the worst team this IPL. I know KXI is languishing at the bottom but they had 2 very close matches at the start and had some bad luck. RR just straight up looks like a shit team if the top order collapses.,5
DCs bowling lineup is underrated!,3

"Tewatia not rotating strike, trying to give another birth of tewatia.",5
The umpire just wanted to see Hetmyer on the big screen,2
For fucks sake he's started defending now. Fuck you Royals. Ruined a great player.,9
You got to make Delhi bat second to ensure jitters. They wallop away to a huge score batting first no matter what you do and the bowling is actually quite lit so you don‚Äôt have much of a chance.,2
10 sixes coming,2
"I think they are Hyping up Ben Stokes too much.
He'll do the same thing Tewatia is doing right now just in English.",12

Why do indians suggest a complete overhaul to every team that's losing? They always want their 11 to play the next match. I'm watching the match on Hotstar and every 2 minutes there's someone with a suggestion to drop players and shuffle the batting order.,10
"Nortje be like"" why you not scoring runs.. fine I'll give you some""",2
"Go home cameraman, you‚Äôre drunk.",6

Can someone explain this strategy to me please...,2

Gee that's handy. Drop a catch and then take the two remaining wickets yourself. That's something a cynical person would be saying right now.,10

This DC team will be in play deep into the season when pitches will get slower. Only question is how they will handle tricky chases. I dont think any one batsman is in great form. Its combo of all of them.

They can keep trying but everyone knows punjab is winning this year. Need to win just 7 out of 8 matches. Easy peasy,34
Lmao it will be a fuck r/cricket moment if both DC and MI lose and KKR wins the trophy,48
" All jokes asides, we still have couple of chinks in our armour that we need to fix before we play MI.

- Dhawan needs to fire big time. Averaging 20-odd with a SR of 120 for someone who bats in the powerplay is not good enough!
- Cannot afford to lose wickets early to their top bowlers(Bumrah, Boult) which unnecessarily creates pressure on the middle order, like it did today after losing Dhawan & Shaw to Archer in 2 overs
- Need to target bowlers like Krunal, Chahar & Pollard who'll bowl 8 overs among them. These are the overs DC should try & score the most since remaining 12 will be bowled by Bumrah, Boult & Pattinson
- Even tho the fielding today was better, we still are(someone confirm) the worst fielding side in the tournament, whereas MI are one of the best. This is where they hold the advantage.
- Even tho Harshal has been good, I still think we need to swap him for Ishant, atleast against MI. They have a heavy Indian batting line up & Ishant is someone who has played with many of their players & probably knows a bit or two about how to bowl to them
- How DC use their 5th bowler(Stoinis & Axar) is going to be very important. Need to complete their 4 overs before Hardik & Pollard come out.
- All in all, this is shaping up to be the most exciting contest in this year's IPL that too on a Sunday night, would definitely be a record viewership
- Key players for MI: Boult, SKY
- Key players for DC: Iyer, Nortje

What do y'all think?",29
I still think they should let teams forfeit against Delhi to save NRR. The other option is to just hand Delhi the trophy already.,28
"I think the real question is...

WHERE IS DANIEL SAMS. I NEED HIM",0
