Mumbai,3
Nohit or Brohit today?,3
"My respect for DK has increased a lot in the past month. From that Nidahas guy to the guy who was made the scapegoat for the 2019 semifinal loss to the guy whose wife (now ex) cheated on him with Murali Vijay and the guy who copped a lot of flak for being an average captain. And he still came out smiling. DK you absolute Boss, you absolute absolute Boss.",20
Hoping for Mumbai to chase and win today,2
Spoiler: Mumbai will win,-6
KKR youu can change your captain but not your fate against MI,1
"The way KKR sees KXIP, MI sees KKR the same way!",7
Any news on narine?,6
"Most teams have won batting first but part of me wants KKR to win the toss, a lot of pressure on KKR today and probably chaos in KKR camp as well so maybe we can bundle them under 150 if they are rattled like last year final match vs KKR",5

"Hello friends, I presume u came so early to reverse jinx",3
"Unrelated, my parrot has stopped dancing, can someone help",3
Very nervous about today. We might see a rejuvenated KKR under a new skipper. Might also bring out the best in DK without the pressure of captaincy.,3
I see a lot of KKR flairs praising us and thinking we'll get an easy win. I see your reverse jinx bois.,8
Good luck Avan Murugan,2
Best thing about reverse jinxing? Makes you seem humble and also saves you the trouble of deleting your comments later if your team loses. Win win situation.,32
"If mi wins this one, I'm like 80% sure that qualifier one will be mi vs dc",23
Have a feeling chasing team wins tonight,3
I want dk to top score and kkr to collapse so all these kkr fickle fans realise the caliber of dk,3
"Kkr please take back uthappa,he misses you guys alot ;)",3
Today absolute brohit...century expected,3
Rohit's gonna avenge his friend DK by scoring a double hundred today.,9
Pattinson is exceptional but I'd like the team to try out Coulter Nile for one or two matches.,2
"Hey kkr mates, is Narine playing? If not then would u prefer lockie, chris green or banton",2

"All this captaincy talk has made me worried if Iyer is fine or not. If he rests tomorrow we will see Pant as the captain, the scenes",2
"Been a while since Mumbai played a new comer.

Chahar and Kishan have been playing regularly for  two seasons now. 

Before that there were Mayank Markande, Nitesh Rana, Krunal, Hardik, Bumrah who rose from MI. 

About time we see someone else being given a chance. Although the team is jam-packed :(

Remember Anukul Roy playing a match last year against Chennai on the turning pitch. Haven't played since.",2
"There a bit of controversy in last super over that Rohit should have came ahead of Hardik, I thought Hardik was the right choice. Who would you send in case it happens again, Rohit or Hardik (with Pollard)",0

"Big fan of morgan

But wud be interesting if morgan commits some howler in the game n at  last Dk comes n saves the day for KKR with his Nidahas inning.",5
KKR should play Lockie in place of Banton. They should also play a spinner in place of Nagarkoti. Last match they looked out of balance,1
Chuffed for the KKR folk who now get to address Morgan as Captain Morgan or OH CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN,3
Hope Pollard comes before 14th over for once.,2
"Alright champs, who should I make captain in my fantasy team?",1
All of the top 3 teams are now playing two foreign pace bowlers. I think KKR should do the same and play Lockie together with Cummins. Should be an interesting combo.,1
Pls play lockie,1

Shit mi losing tosses now :(,2
Eoin the only one who has waited for the question,2
">Kolkata Knight Riders opt to bat

... it came true, just as I wished for. üòÅ",0
KKR batting first. Need to post a total in excess of 200. That's their only chance of winning I feel.,4
"Green in for Banton, Mavi in for Nagarkoti",2
"Why is everyone calling DK's move ""selfless""? He's now shirked future responsibility for losses, and deserted leadership for his personal performance.",-2
"Glad we won the toss, at least.",2
Who's the overseas player who came in for Banton?,1
Grass is always Green on the other side.,2
NCN coming in for patto....,1
NCN in for Pattinson.,1

"NCN in for Pattinson, Interesting. Pattinson didn't do that badly.",3
"Excited to see ncn, even though I liked patti",1
Can't wait to see Eoin Morgan as the captain. DK is a solid player but he's not the most ideal captain. I'm glad that KKR management made the right choice.,4
"Teams:
Mumbai Indians (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Quinton de Kock(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jasprit Bumrah

"As a neutral there are many changes happening for KKR at the top, if Tripathi- Gill were firing they should have stuck with it. Too many chopping and changes surely hasnt helped anyone",2
what's gonna change with KKR bois?,1
"Im still so cheesed because of yesterday‚Äôs captaincy fiasco that I don‚Äôt even know who to support for this game. If MI wins, it becomes tougher for RCB to finish in top 2. If KKR wins, it puts more pressure on RCB to qualify for playoffs. Screw you Kohli and your shitty left hand right hand tuk tuk strategy yesterday",1
KKR have won the toss and elected to lose by wickets,11
If kolkata wins against MI in what is Morgan's first match as captain dude will start his stint as a kkr legend,4
Feel bad for banton being dropped after one game but green is better for team balance.,6
"Wud have played lockie n kuldeep

Donno why they r counting off such class China man 

Still green has really good stats n has been good in BBL

Lets see how he goes here",3
"NCN inclusion is great ,but why today (¬¥-Ôπè-`Ôºõ)


Also great to have Mavi and Green in ,  still feel spin is lacking",3
"Huh Rohit Sharma actually made the changes I wanted. 

On an unrelated note, you've never seen me and Rohit in the same room.

On an even more unrelated note, I have a 1 pack ab.",6
Where r those guys who wanted to drop Morgan n play Banton btw,9
MI needs to win and save dk's honour,3
I can already see the articles about green warned for suspect action.,5
"Narine out? Did he get injured or something? He was in good form with the ball. Also IMO dropping Pattinson was harsh given he was performing really well, but NCN is also class in T20s.  Glad to see Gill and Tripathi at the top as well, KKR look good.",3
Kolkata winning the toss and batting first was the only way this match was going to remain close. Looking forward to a good one,9
"Don‚Äôt agree with Narine‚Äôs exclusion, are we just never going to play him again because of a warning?

If he gets another warning from a virgin snitch umpire then so be it.",2
Would've liked to see Banton get another go tbh,4
"People who r supporting other teams, whom r u supporting today(ofc depending on the increase in chances for playoffs)

Except dc, I know u guys don't want mi to win(what I've mostly found)",1
"Obviously supporting MI here. If KKR win today and beat SRH on Sunday, and CSK and RR lose tomorrow, the top 4 are essentially decided.",-1
I can totally remember DK playing for DD and RCB but for some reason I've completely forgotten about his days in MI.,7
Harsh to drop Banton after one match ffs,12
"I guess, Rohit is struggling to find Vada-Pav stalls there.",7
How many days will they take to check narine's action was legal or not?,3

Ncn probably will get injured and Mitchell McCleneghan will have to play the playoffs eventually. Deja vu.,4
RCB to win tomorrow,3
Didn't Green's action get reported not too long ago too?,3
Bruh. Does the pace reserve of MI ever ends. NCN is a gun pacer. Sad he went to MI. I can see 5 teams that need him,3
They already replaced DK with Morgan in the artwork for the livestream. These guys move fast,30
Just want MI to win so that we dont have threats from anyone else.,4

Good move from KKR to sack that clueless fuck.,-10

cant believe mccleneghan hasnt had a bowl yet.i hope they give him a match too like ncn. just so hes match ready.,6
I know that it's I'll advised to tinker with something that is working but I kind of want to see Lynn smack a few for us. He has some issues with spin and so might not be effective later in the tournament when the tracks start to aid spin.,4
Is NCN good at Death ?,4
Wow suddenly this sub has become a bastion of sympathy for DK? Fix your mind,30
cApTaIn MoRgAn,5
Coulter-Nile is a tall bloke,6

Ambani needs to make his statement today after CSK,-6

Apparently boulty boi has been hit for the most fours this tournament,5
"So, what do we call Morgan when he does something wrong in captainship? Useless fuck, Fraud English, fool, dumb, or something else?",11
Rooting for a Gill special,1
Did r/cricket bully DK into giving captaincy to Morgan?,51
Mega auctions should happen where no team can retain anyone and there will no rtm. Time for revamp of all the teams,-18
Match 8 and Mumbai finally field their best 11. Excellent job by Tiwary and Pattinson too and Pattinson would definitely come back if they are rotating their pacers.,10

"If kkr doesn't make it to the playoffs, this will be a legitimate 6d move by DK",35

Just 1 runs in 4 balls! Gill is literally Hitler.,6
Drop the bastard for Nikhil Naik. He's being robbedü§¨üìê,0
Why no Pattinson?,1
Now MI bats till 8. Wtf MI?,-1
Gill playing test cricket,1
Gill's strike rate has been a problem for KKR.,2
MI should give Lynn and McDonald a game after locking play of spot.,4
Gill puts too much pressure on the other batsman all the time. Rana gets out trying to hit it without having settled because the rr is freakin 6.2,4
Ffs We waited 2 damn years to see Coulter-Nile play for us,2
Has the aura around Shaw and Gill slightly reduced. They are good players but will take quite a while to become great.,4
Are we sure NCN is 100% fit. His run up isn't very smooth.,5
In cricket Captains have too much on their hands to take care of. DK looks so chill after years.,2

Oh come on NCN. Messing up boulty boi's spell right now.,2
Nattu can't be the emerging player :(,11
I am not a big fan of cautious start in T20s especially when you have a long batting lineup.,1
NCN is either rusty or he's trying to make KKR thibk that way so they go after him and he snaps them,1

Boult looks hot,2
MI players are bit sleepy.,1
"Man, I'm tired of Gill. PP has been a bore this season",2
NCN's wides remind of of when you finally get to play cricket after a month long of inactivity due to final exams & stuff. So you keep sending down the wides until you finally find your length.,8
As a csk fan who should I be supporting?1,5
I don't understand this sub's obsession over Gill. Guy is bang average in T20's,4
Kkr with Narine and Lynn opening and now is so different it's crazy. Our poor starts are putting too much pressure on the middle order since we score literally run a ball in the powerplays.,5
Kolkata should be wreaking havoc against these thiccfucks,1
"*Intimidate on field with misfields*


The last KKR match was real intimidation, that Bumrah over against Morgan and Russell, Bumrah acting like throwing a ball on Russell.


Bring that energy back boys.",0
"> ""Yesterday DK informed us he would **like to step back and focus on his batting as he feels that is the best option for the team**. That is extremely selfless, and takes a lot of courage. I am delighted to be in the leadership role in the team. We are halfway through the tournament. We have shown some protentional but we haven't realised it fully. In any great side, you need to have a number of leaders in the change room. We have abundance of those. **Between myself and Dinesh, we can be at the forefront of that, but the driving engine is the guys behind us. Gill, Rana, Nagarkoti**. Tonight we go with a little bit of a different combination in order to improve on that [bowling at the death]. Hopefully the tactics and strategy we have decided works.""

Rana has been shitty this IPL. Maybe try someone else at 3.,1

So sending DK ahead of Morgan and Dre wasn't really DK's decision. But so many idiots believed that he was selfish.,3
Feels like ages since we last played at Dubai,1
Honestly when the heck has Rana ever played a decent innings? I always see him getting out cheaply except the one time he played for us.,10
Kkr batsmen have been awful this season. All matches they have won is because of their bowling.,2
KKR batsmen in a hurry so as to not miss the Amazon Great Indian festival,7
KKR  shitting the bed against Mumbai nothing new to see here folks,7
"I was pretty disappointed when MI let go of Rana. While he's done well for KKR, I don't think he's replicated the form he found for like, half a season in MI where he almost benched Rayudu.",5
Mumbai is like the death star but with no weak spots. Too fucking good.,2
Dk the only rich dude whom I feel bad for now,3

Will DK play an ex-captain knock today?,3

Trans: covid times when the world is struggling, these guys are showing unrealistic and cringe ads.",5
Rana is so similar to Suresh Raina. He also struggled with the short ball throughout his career. But overall Raina was obviously the much better all-round batsman.,7
Kkr jeetega aaj. Please,1
No longer captain DK in the crease.,7
How can a two time champion have a 6-20 record against another team it's pretty disgraceful,5

Rana is shit against short ball kinda like raina,5

Boult and Coult partnership is going to be an excellent combination along with Bumrah,10
every kkr match is a snooze fest till the last over rolls around,9
Guys you ever heard of a temporary captain?: Decock probably,51
This is a CSK level powerplay.,8
Everyone ridiculed DK for not sending Morgan at 4 and now Morgan himself backed out and sent DK at 4. Where are the haters now?,14
"Just want DK to do well,  to shit on r/cricket.",43
Another awful powerplay for kkr. Below 6 rpo.,1
Surprised Karthik is coming ahead of Morgan. He is arguably better in a finishing role while Morgan would be better able to anchor the innings,6
Thala Riders,9

I think karthik has got enough love today time to give a reason to shit on him again.,3
"Morgan Masterstroke

If DK fails : DK is bad drop him

If DK scores : Great Captaincy from Morgan by sending DK at 4",8
This move to send Karthik at no 4 shows that decision making is in hand of coach not captain,6

Someone beat the shit out Krunal over.,1
Now Gill has an excuse for ‚Äòpacing‚Äô his innings out. Wow.,1
Only time I remember DK firing was when he was in Mumbai,5
Krunal Pandya looks like what Ajay Devgan would if he actually chewed Zuban Kesari.,35

"As an opposition Shubhman Gill doesn't seem threatening at all, he needs to improve his attacking game",2
DK struggling somehow always reminds me of 2019 semi final,5
Good placement,2
"DK let go of Captaincy to concentrate on Batting and now his Batting will be under even more pressure coz there's a real chance of him getting dropped.

He averages 15 this season so far.",3
"Krunal bowling to contain, not take wickets. DK still not off the mark, and as I say it... fantastic shot.",3
MI looking too OP for the other teams this season. Still can't believe they lost to CSK,0
Anyone old enough to remember Buchanan's multiple captain theory,6
I still don't know why I am watching this match knowing very well that KKR will lose anyway,9
Just a decade back we used to spend rs.3 to get cricket scores.. i am feeling old now.,10
"Based on performances so far & historic record against MI, which teams are capable of beating MI to win the 2020 trophy?",2
KKR's run rate in the powerplay this year is 7.06,3

DK can be the captain of the new franchises like Surat Snakes,8
"Just tuned in and learned about DK resigning as captain. Can't comment yet on whether the decision was right, but mad respect for the man. Hope he does really well as a bat",8

"Morgan is like "" shit I have to do everything here""",4
Need Morgan and Dk at this stage to do something,1
"Gill and KL are rightly criticised for their SR, if they are playing the role of anchors, it is their responsibility to bat till 16th over and put the team in the driver's seat. A 55(45) is harmful and in this case a 21(23). Failed anchor innings is far more harmful then the benefits of a successful anchor innings",-2
Even a great captain won't help with this kind of batting,-1
"Genuine question, does anyone remember Pollard ever dropping a catch?",2
I just hope that Tendulkar doesn't pull any string to get this KLPD wannabe in national team.,-1

Tuk tuk,1
"From last IPL, Dean Jones (RIP deano) suggested a new metric to judge batsmen in T20 - the sum of averages and strike rates. That way, both factors get a weightage. KL was wrong to say that strike rates are overrated. They are important, but not everything by themselves. KL's killing it, so I guess he can say what he wants, but he was definitely wrong in how he said it.

Side note: I wonder if they ranked batsmen by that sum metric this IPL, what that ranking would look like. Any math nerds/geniuses wanna help out?",6

100 tonight for Dr.?,2
Clearly giving up the captaincy helped him play better.,5
Kolkata Flight Flyers. Bye bye. Won't qualify for the playoffs this year. SRH has better a team,-1
Dre Russ there toeing it completely and still hitting 80m,4
Oh no.,1
BC timeout in middle of over,7
Sometimes I feel there‚Äôs 1 person too many in the comm box.,1

Weird timing for a timeout..,4
Phew. Crossed 49.,31

"Why, one ball left I think!!!",1
Mid over timeout lmao.,3
Time for Lee to tear up Bumrah's action,2
At least finish the over for ffs,2
Time to meme Russell back into form,3
i mean if there‚Äôs a partnership that could still bring kkr to 150 it‚Äôs these guys,2
Why tf are his boots of different colors,1
Bring in bumrah!!! Now!!! He took both these blokes out lasti vs kkr game,6
Did they cheat us of a ball?,3

DreRus 100(30) incoming!!,4
"These 2 fire

Still 180+ possible",3
"Hits it a million miles, *stares at his toe*",3
Timeout just when dre gets going. KKR can't catch a break.,3
It seems it's race to the bottom of the table instead of up this IPL. RCB and DC sitting in top 4 pretty early shook every other teams.,2
Russell can play safely though. He did last year and won the match. 50 off 45 or something. That was something else,5
Ha ha ha ball gone missing....,2
"KKR top order: collapses

Dr. Dre: fine, I'll do it myself",5
A strategic timeout with 1 ball left in the over is ultimate shithousery,2

Bumrah with that big triangle energy,3

"Timing of the startegic timeout, very strategic indeed",3
"Strategic timeout on the fifth ball of the over. 

3 minutes of ads in the space of one ball.

Why does IPL have 2 timeouts? Other leagues like CPL only have 1 and that‚Äôs good enough,8
"Shubman Gill is the culprit.

It has seemed like all those games that there has been undue pressure of increasing the scoring rate right from the onset. He needs to be benched or have a talking to or just send him in later on.",14
Wow styris was in the winning DC team in 2009?,11
21-6 loading....,6
"Chris Green was born is South Africa WTF, how in the world does South Africa produce so many quality cricketers",12
Styris' triangle the biggest haha.,5
With Kohli's action you'll probably get a rhombus instead of a triangle.,10
Badri just chilling between Styris and Binga and enjoying their analysis.,9
I see Morgan's first match in charge is going well then,6
Bruh someone made a kkr thread already,5
"Fuck off with this 1 ball BS.

Mid Over timeouts should be banned with the exception of a wicket falling.",6

Dr. Zaheer Khan,5
Who is in the dugout with styris and Lee?,2
Can someone do a triangle post of today's match for the ones who aren't lucky enough to see analysis?,3

The Triangle of Speed and the Hypotenuse of Heat are back,4
Even Chahar's leggies are turning. Nohit a near certainty for today.,8
After Binga's revelation I played back and examined frame by frame Shoaib Akhtar's bowling. He bends his front leg at the point of delivery. Does that mean he could possibly have bowled even faster with that ideal triangle?,3
Inb4 morgan gets bowled to the same delivery,6
KKR 180 with Morgan 70+. You heard it here first,9
Please ask Zaheer Why Bumrah is not able to nail Yorkers like Natarajan. Man we are 1 month already into tournament now. I miss 9-11 Yorkers a match Bumrah üòû,10
Let's see what WOrLd bESt cAPtAin does here,6

"Oh boy what a bad start for Morgan' stint.



Now some people will act like DK was a 3 WC winning captain and nothing wrong ever happened when he was the skipper.",6
I remember KKR letting McCullum and Gayle go cause they were not suited to KKR plan of being passive and looking to score 150-160 consistently for their bowlers. Funny few years later they have got McCullum as coach thinking he'll re-create succes of Gambhir. Cute Venky Mysore üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠,6

"DK obstacles : 




India team : Dhoni





Personal life : Murali Vijay





Captaincy :  Eoin Morgan. 







Cricket has made and destroyed DK.",10
Cummins stole Steve Smith's batting soul.,6
How did KKR win any matches?,0
Someone give that swann an altroz,2
">Jaa jee le apni zindagi

DK to Morgan

T: Live your life fully.",6
"Who should KKR retain in mega Auction? Gill, Morgan and?",2
Cummins shielding Morgan away from strike. Nice,6
It's such a basic looking car lmao I know you're getting paid millions for it but pls stop wanking over it,7
"Kkr shud learn from csk

N open with cummins next game",6
Morgan is like I have no worries as long as Pat the bully is batting alongside me.,4
Danny literally orgasms every time they show Altroz,4
"Gill really is the next Kohli

Both are playing alike this season",5
KKR should definitely be proud if they can get to 150+ after this kind of a start,5
Imagine coming in at the eleventh over and being the highest scorer already 3 overs later..,4
scenes if Morgan cannot tally DK's 4 wins in the remaining half of the tournament..,7
At this point I'd be disappointed if Tata don't give Swann a cut of altroz sales. Man's done half of their marketing,13
Commentators should go to horny jail for talking about Altroz like this,11
can they switch captain mid-over?,3
2013 Sharma is pre vadapav sharma,2
Cummins is batting good cause he might have to get 10 wickets under 100 runs.,5

"MI too op honestly, please nerf",8
Cider absolutely fuckin it up,1
Bro wtf kkr makes me want to kill myself lol,6
What is with Cummins and Mumbai bowling?,13
MI have a bit of nothing spin attack for pitches that are slowing down. Other teams are stacked with spinners. Should be interesting how they go from here on.,1
You know you have a serious problem as a team when pat cummins has consistently been your best batsman,13
Cummins has scored more runs than Russel this season,6
"Oh man. I felt bad for DK..only for a while though, till he played that horrible pre-meditated shot, after falling of Gill in previous ball.",1
"Ban Mumbai BC, too Op",10

Edit: Wrong Chahar. Sorry for Failing you r/cricket. I submit to your mockery and judgement.",11
It's disappointing as a KKR fan to see how dysfunctional our batting lineup is,6
"There's something wrong with my glasses, I seem to permanently have a thousand yard stare watching this team play",2
Hold your horses r/cricket MI might shit harder,11
We need a 50 from both for a respectable total,4
Cummins as highest score and best strike rate tells you all you need to know about KKR,5
Early IPL Mumbai had lost 7 wickets or so for 80 odd and Harbhajan took them to 140 odd which they defended. Same happened in 2017 final I guess with Krunal.,11
"Cricket commentary is a dream job, getting paid to watch and talk about the game you love. However, that bit where you have to try and flog a car like it's some exotic supercar might stop me doing it.",13
Lmao Cumdog  already the highest scorer with the best SR,5
"De kock just said I am ball, the ball is hand",4
"Cummins has been average with the ball this IPL, it is not his strongest form but he has been so valuable with the bat. This innings can prove to be match winning.",3

Here for a cummins MOTM for a unbeaten 70 and a 5fa,15
The ball was never the de cock's grasp. Lmao.,5
Can't believe Pollard is only 33.,18

Cummins the batsman is gonna cause us so much problems when we tour Australia.,17
"Cummins haha, kept vadapav under pressure with that 2.",14
What the fuck is Morgan doing,1
DK wouldn't have been made to step down from captaincy if KKR won Qualifier 2 in SRH. They were one Afghan away from the finals. Just saying,7
Good job from tailender by rotating strike giving their best batsman Cummins maximum strike,6
"""The Ball was never in de cock's grasp."" Hardick, de cock, cummins. All while Bangar on the dugout. The potential is unlimited.",10
"genuinely concerned for Swann today, he‚Äôs high as a kite",10
"The only chance KKR have is if Cummins is fed up with all the drama, says Fukk it and decides to blow MI away.",4
|Cummins 96 runs| |Russell 83 runs|                                              |Cummins -2 Wickets| |Russell- 6 Wickets|,17

Has KP left IpL?,3
Krunal is so annoying man. He gets away with his overs so easily. Would love to see him get spanked at least once this season.,7

Time for Cummins to go insane.,8
What a slower ball from Bumrah lmao,9
Arjun Tendulakar still plays cricket or has gone off to do something else?,3
Bumrah out for revenge today,9
That slower ball was straight outta Malinga's book.,11

Gosh love watching Bumrah bowl,4
Damn that ball,2
"Cummins looking better than every other Aussie batsmen barring Stoinis.

Guess who‚Äôs giggling in the dugout today?,5
Oh shades of baseball. Players practicing in the pen,2
Unpopular opinion: Dugout is boring,-1
"KKR really need to be brilliant and lucky with their bowling today. No tuk tuk batsmen in MI, so getting at least 2-3 wickets in PP is their only chance of staying in the game.",3
Was that a spin ball Bumrah bowled first ball?,5
SRK is just happy it's not Wankhede,8

Fuck bumrah he's so OP,15
Gg from Bumrah. He got smashed by Cummins last time around and worked on beating him this time.,4
Bumrah can replace Ashwin if this keeps going like this.,6
4 over 60 req for a chance,6
Shane bond said that Bumrah had a new ball in his bag which he learnt during lockdown. He has bowled off cutters earlier in this IPL. Player that adds variations and improves themselves,9
Inb4 Cummins makes 50,8

Imagine KKR somehow defend this with some god level captaincy from Morgan. Would be epic.,22
Good fielding by 90s Bollywood hero.,10
Bumrah is cricket version of Captain Tsubassa.,8
Boult was pretty average at death for us last season. Huge test for him this. He's certainly improved but still.,13
almost gambhir'd,4
Damn Cummo put it in pants,6
Isn't that wide?,1
Why not wide?,1
Fuccboi Indians has struck gold with Bumrah-Boult combination,14

15.5 crores starting to make sense.,10
Where are the fielders,1
r/cricket is divided between DK and Morgan but the real imposter mastermind is sitting in the dugout wise guys.,5
What is it on Cummo's back?,5
Fucking hell Cummins loves smacking us around,9
Cummillionaire‚Ñ¢,5
Not wide cause he want across,2
"KKR fans who are worried about Russel's form, please check when y'all are playing against RCB next.",8

Kkr should try opening with Cummins like narine..,3
Sexy yorker what the fuck!,1
"Wait, why is that not a wide?",3
Cummins can bowl in 140s and bat properly. Damn he's definitely becoming a solid all rounder.,4
Third grade umpiring from Indian umpires as always . PS I am an Indian too. Gotta be honest.,3
"Scott Styris 2018 IPL : "" Tim Southee is not a death bowler, RCB should learn this quickly""

Bowl pollard you coward.,5
I want an Mi collapse to make it intresting,3
have a feeling Bumrah will leak here,2
Strike rate between over 16-20 is no a stupid stat. I mean even bumrah strikes at the strike rate of 200.,3

GOAT Cummins 108* runs",18
"So.. this is why Pat's getting the big bucks! 

In all seriousness, More intent and purpose than any of the KKR batsman. Even managed to keep the yorker out well.",8
Man there is something about cummins' eyes. I am straight but he does something to me.,3
150+ and match becomes tricky,5
Cummins was the Dre Russ KKR never promised,7
You know Boulto had an okay record in IPL before this edition but he's been really good for MI in this one.,6
"Thala Morgan but to be honest, a responsible innings",8
"Ok bois, what did you have for dinner?",2
Now this is good captaincy. Bowl out your strike bowler because they have to hit anyway. We would just hold Rabada back for the last over which I absolutely hate.,8
Fun fact Malinga was bowling mentor for MI in 2018.,6
Who is Green ? Bowler ?,2
DK expected what a shitshow this match going to be! No captaincy,2
"Off topic but.. Does anyone else cringe when they hear ""Universe Boss""? Atleast call him Universal Boss!",1

Why is 111 called Nelson?,5
Mumbai and DC are steam rolling everyone. They're sure to qualify. I thought ma RCB bois were sure too but after last night I think they don't wanna,10
Even the dugout is bantering Manchester United. Nowhere is safe,11
r/Cricket really thinking hard who they can blame for the slow rate,4
It still baffles me how does krunal bowls decently in IPL and gets tonked all over when he plays international,10
I'm really surprised nobody is shredding Morgan's SR today.,11

God damn you Indians. He barely drop catches. Give Quinny a break. It happens.,13
QDK robbed Bumbrah off a vengeance after trolling Cummins for the last 2 overs,6
Non curvy girls should not marry flat track bullies unless they want to be stuck in a bad 1 sided marriage.,5

"Cummins this season

QdK!?  I guess he wants a Bumrah hug again (ca. last year's IPL final?),7
Kamran Akmal is playing in IPL,2
That's ma man Bumer.,3
Bumrah is wholesome. rarely does he show any frustration. Just a wry smile and then back to business. A rare fast bowler who is not temperamental and cranky like most are.,13
Kock can't get cumm out,9
Guys how can we blame MS DK or KL for this?,4
"Remember last year's final when Bumrah consoled QDK after a huge mistake, what a guy.",10

Really shows how bad KKR is playing when MI won't be bothered with a missed catch! Look at everyone smiling!,10
anything Cummins hits now is on ~~Bumrah~~ dekock,0
This batting is just an audition for RCB,5
I refuse to believe this is the same management that stuck with Narine through his ban and Dre Russ through his injuries,6
Why length Gend,4
"Lol, that drop and KKR didn't even run.",4
Bumrah has max Golden Retriever energy,9
Every RUN Cumdog scores from here is on u QDK,8

Its okay Quinton. I made him my bitch.,2
Justifying his purchase by just this knock,4
Cumdog striking it so clean.,3
Cumdog GOAT,3
ah shit here we go again.,5
This innings alone is worth 15 cr.,12
Has cummins worked on his batting cause he is showing some serious technique,6
I won‚Äôt be surprised if Pat opens next match,5

He is worth it.,5
"Man, Qdk's South Africa's captain now. How time flies",6
This fucking hurts. But what a knock from Cummins tho. Has brought some respectability to the total score,11
Indians and allowing tailender to score name a more iconic duo,13
Would be fun if Cummins take Kock‚Äôs wicket in his first over too,1
Harsha just said all you gay gay r fans. Wtf,3
De Cock gave Cum another shot,6
De Kock is unreliable in crunch situations like most South African team players really. I still remember the missed run outs from the World Cup 2015 semi final.,10
Pat Cum is goated,3
"De Kock ü§úü§õBairstow

Nice fightback from KKR. They are very much in the game.,9
Can we see Morgan score at 100 today?,7
What is that hump on Cummins back?,8
"Fun fact. Boult is more expensive than NCN in death. How do i know? Well, I was a kkr fan",9
Why is Cummins playing the way Morgan should be playing,10
Bumrah is the epitome of a nice guy. Still remember when he went and consoled qdk during last year's final. The context is important. MI had almost lost the game when he misfielded that ball and it went to the boundary. He's done something similar here. Top top guy.,17
cummins is 5th highest run scorer for kkr this season,2
Kiska iPhone baja üòÇ,4
Great batting from Cummins but get that back checked out.,3
"Hardick, decock, Cummins and dk make the fap 4",8
Somebody tell Morgan it's a 20 over match,7
Thala Morgan with great strike rotation in the 19th over,3
De Kock dropped Cum,5
Aussies will probably coom when they see this knock,5
Yeah KKR fans will be jumping around for a 140 score -_-,4
Morgan with a forward defense in 19th over,4
Morgan should have just swing it for the two balls. We need Cummins on strike in last over.,5
Dhoni makes more sense than the Morgan innings so far lol.,9
Wtf someone's phone went off in the commentary box haha,14
"That's right Morgan, put the main batsman back on strike",9
Cummins is going to have a field month in the upcoming IND-AUS series,6
I'm fine with Cummins scoring as it'll give us an exciting 2nd innings,6
That fake KKR chant is more fake than my gf's orgasm,17
Morgan took over DK's batting as well i guess,3
"Why are they bowling boult when they have rohit, a former hattrick taker",7
All MI homies hate Pat Cummins,10
Cummings not getting any support from tailender.,8
"Bumrah's attitude doesnt belong to fast bowler category, such a gentleman cricketer....I love sportsmen who're humble.
Dravid, Sachin, Bumrah, Gilchrist, Murali, Kumble - all let their skills do the talking...",16
If only they got 160 we would have had a good match. Anything below is fairly easy to chase,2
"Cummins retaining strike, as he should.",3
But who will morgan pass the captaincy to?,2
"NCN still has one over, KKR have a real chance of getting 150.",2
cummy should be captain now,5
"Captaincy crowns Morgan, and so does Thala mode.",4
The scenes if DK was 23 off 25 in the 19th over.,8
"Imagine if it was DK batting at 23(25) in over 19 instead of Morgan.

Poor batting and worse tactics by Morgan in his first game as a captain so far.",9
Never thought I‚Äôd see Cummins deny the strike to Eoin Morgan,10
Morgan has done fuck all tbh,1
Morgan striving for a single even in this over would be peak meme.,4
de cock is going to start his innings with -17 runs today.,7
"So this is why they paid Cummins 15 crore, it was for his batting.",14
Brett Lee's Hypotenuse of Heat it is!,9
"NCN has been rusty today, KKR might score big in this over.",4
Morgan paying a true Dhoni-esque inning here,3
can kkr get 150? Even that isn't enough I reckon,1
"Thanks everyone, but I don't need random anagram updates",7
"Guys, they said I could be captain this week.",4
This MI XI got everything. What nonsense xi is this...,3
"Apart from the Sharjah game, Morgan has been horrible",5
Cummins is unironically contender for best Aussie batsman this IPL,20
NCN. Rejoice KKR fans.,3
Cummins baby!,6
Cummins with the hard carry,6
What a knock Cumdog!,3
Morgan playing at a healthy strike rate for ODIs,5
Mumbai is just too good. Everyone in that team is a match winner. It should be illegal to have such a strong team,5
"Morgan is literally avoiding the strike as much as possible to keep Cumdog at the right end

You love to see it",15
"*de Kock, Cummins or Hardik comes into play*

Match thread: teehee it's time to be 13 year old again",18
Well deserved 50,8
Nice batting PAT!!! justifying his price.,5
Absolute state of KKR batting. SRK should learn how to make a team. Great innings by Cummins.,7
cummins GOAT,2
Wth does cummins have on his back ?,1
"Where are the fielders for Cummins, is he a god at Placement",7
Cummins you beautiful fucking man.,3
Pat Cummins,2
Morgan was just letting KKR extract back that 15Cr,6
First T20 50 for Cumgod.,6
Phone ringing in the comm. Box üòÇ,1
Cummins has  more runs than dk this season,6
Top innings from cummo in the circumstances,3
What a comeback by KKR,4
Thala Morgan,2
Cummins wow daddy,5
Cummo üòçüòçüòç,2
Make Cummins the captain. What's with not making bowlers captain?,4
"Obligatory ""called it"" comment
> Most teams have won batting first but part of me wants KKR to win the toss, a lot of pressure on KKR today and probably chaos in KKR camp as well so maybe we can bundle them under 150 if they are rattled like last year final match vs KKR

https://old.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jc8ow6/match_thread_32nd_match_mumbai_indians_v_kolkata/g8zvczs/?context=3",5
Best knock in this IPL tbh,3
NCN can u plz do NGIDI here,2
Wait until KKR promotes Cummins to be an opener in the next game...,11
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Cummins. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Cummins. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",14
Should have picked Cummins over Green in the fantasy XI.,6
I guess Cummins was definitely worth the price tag.,6
Should have been pollard.,1
Morgan has been captain for half a match. Give him a little time. Also he was appointed just yesterday.,6
Come on lads not even this sub would criticise DK for being 23(25) if Cummins was going well and the entire top order shat the bed,3
Not sure what people have a problem with Morgan rotating the strike.,7
Morgan is playing like shit but won't get any criticism because he's not Dhoni,-3
Cummins stole everyone's batting powers,6
Can't spell Pat Cummins without mint MI,9
Bring on Cummins b4 every not worthy batsman in KKR ffs,8
The fuck is that clap from Suhana?,29
"Deal Gill, no hard feelings but this is how you play",4
NCN last over oof.,4
Cummins doing what he does regularly for Australia... bail them out of collapses.,8
Mumbai has played 5 out of 8 games here. Like that‚Äôs unfair. Subtle cheating.,2
Bring pattinson back,5
Russell has borrowed Baz's book and taking notes from this Cummins performance /s,8
"Happy for Pat Cummins, nice 50",11
What a fight back lmao,12
It‚Äôs great that Transpeople also support KKR,-3
Can't believe I want Morgan on strike over Pat Cummins,9
Meme cummins,6
"NCN looks rusty and unfit, shouldn't have rushed him into the team",8
Amazing partnership considering the circumstances they were in,6
Morgan‚Äôs times this to perfection. Shhh for those who spoke bad of my captain,6
Can you not bowl length balls pls,2
This is not really good news for KKR. Mumbai gonna twat the target in 18 overs.,4
"Ofcourse a six now, 20-25 of the over. NCN Paisa Barbad Behenchod",10
That is the weirdest clap I have ever seen,13
Game on bois,3
Inb4 Cummins is the new Narine and is gonna open next match. It might work ngl.,13
[removed],8
Rohit is gonna eat balls today instead of vada pav.,5
Stoinis and Mitch Marsh are shaking in their boots.,6
Finally INTENT‚Ñ¢,12
"Never thought I'd be happy to see an Aussie make a half century but here I am, well played lad",17
CummDogg ~~Millionaire~~ Half-centurion,13
Alright game on now,5
"Next game: Cummins to open the innings to give  KKR a strong start

aka The Sunil Narine Factor 2.0",9
Polly should have bowled,1
That hump is where he stores his batting talent.,8
"Cummins just needs to take a fifer as well, it will become the GOAT t20 performance",5
*Patto smiling in a corner...*,5
OH ~~VICE~~ CAPTAIN MY ~~VICE~~ CAPTAIN,8
[deleted],-5
Wtf,2
People forgetting about 61/5 in 11 overs and shitting on Eoin Morgan.,21
KKR should drop Rana and promote Cummins to No. 4,9
They're discussing about baby over,5
Quarter Nail got hammered today,1
Need 150 to have some outside chance,3
Damn 150 might just be on,3
ROFL @ swann's irish accent,3
GG comenting on NCN and Boult bowling is funny coz he captained both of them.,3
Why was Pattinson dropped for this clown,-2
Why do I feel like there are a lot of internal politics in the KKR camp. Like it‚Äôs falling apart from the inside especially with how the captaincy change was announced just before the match.,6
Cummins do be showing more intent than Dre Russ. Cummins the real finisher,5
"Had them by the balls at 61-5

They came back, will be losing this match now.",1
"Rohit Sharma with some eüÖ±Ô∏èic fielding, as usual.",4
"Can't be dropped from the team if you  score runs instead of taking wickets.

*Cummins taps head*",9
Would've been close if qdk had caught the ball,1
Rohit with a vadapav aim,10
"How much money did we spend for NCN? I mean I'm not writing him off, just wanted to know.",2
"QdK relationship with Bumrah is a sight to see.


19th over in final in 2019 and that miss by QdK and today again.",8
Would have been out had the throw been better,1
61/5 in 11 overs. Really good stuff till now but it won't be enough against mi,4
On a side note. can we all agree to think of Joe Denly as the 2005 winning ashes captain?,1
Both Pattinson and NCN got cunted. With Boult as well being iffy at death suddenly Mumbais looking vulnerable at death.,3
Cummins actually should open next match. He thrashed THIS MI bowling attack who knows what else he could do? Playing Boult like he was Siraj.,5
Morgan doing a dhoni,-1
Can't spell Pat Cummins without simps. üòçüòç,5
"Fuck Narine, open with Cumdog you cowards.",11
Kkr to Pat Cummins  - Oh Captain My Captain,11
Cummins bowls well and the game will turn lmao,3
140 is enough.,4
"Should Ishan Kishan keep for MI, De Cock dropped a Catch and Missed two run outs. Plus he Almost lost us the finals last year",-7
"Look how many balls they've each faced, Morgan's done a good job of getting Cummins on strike",23
Cummins gonna have no stamina left to bowl lol.,19
This is really good stuff from KKR at the end,12
Part of me wants to see Narine open with Cummins,13
KKR got their aussie Brohit and send him to bat at 7. Smh my head,12
Morgan haters just got silenced,13
Looks like KKR paid Cummins 15.5cr to strengthen batting.,19
Both the Aussies made their 50s,17
Bring back Pattinson,6
That's just bad bowling,4
Captains knock,5
Rayudu probably broke his tv looking at these guys run,6
"What's the difference between a stoner and a bald father?  
  
Ek ganja pita hai dusra pita ganja hai.",6
IPL 2020 and big last overs,1
Fuckin Morgan what a shot what a finish thalaisque,3
"At the start of the game I would've taken a 150 score from KKR. But we had them on the mat at 61/5, and should've killed them off. Interesting game this.",3
So KKR will still lose but at least it won't be as embarrassing now,3
Pattinson was good. Why change,1
And that's 50 for NCN,2
Two bowlers completed their 50.,4
Cummins might be the best bowling allrounder along with morris,3
Damn Cummins can bat,1
Well saved KKR,1
People thought they got Cummins for his bowling. Little did they know it was the batting they looked at.,2
They actually got to a nice score! Interesting.,1
"Good day for the Australians, both Cummins and NCN get their first 50s",6
NCN and Pat Cummins hitting a 50,2
Loved this innings. Ngl,1
Game on boys,1
"Proper finish there, good job from these guys to avoid a collapse and give them half a chance",2
I think Morgan started off too late,3
"6 off the last ball, that‚Äôs three innings in a row. Morris, Pooran and now Morgan!",5
Hardick not bowling has hurt us more than i thought.,3
Coulter-Siraj-Nile,7
That's a very respectable total after they looked like they won't even get to 100. GG,10
Coulter Nile with his first 50,2
Even bumrah got hit . Don‚Äôt blame ncn playing his first game,-1
Coulter Nile is trash bring back Pattinson,7
Captain's innings,2
Short of par score but this might give KKR an edge because of how they came back from death.,5
Advantage kkr could defend this easy have momentum,0
Anybody know how many did Cummo get of NCN?,3
"MI probably felt bad for KKR, so they sent Coulter-Nile to bowl the last over",7
Double Oz 50s today,6
MONSTAHH,3
50 for NCN,2
Morgan heard yall talking shit,16
I was hoping he‚Äôd go earlier but that‚Äôs a captain‚Äôs knock right there!,8
Morgan has played this beautifully,6
Thalaesque knock,4
All aboard the Cumdog train ü§ó,9
" Waited so long for this Lmao. 

I was like ‚ÄúMorgan will go big now will go big now‚Äù every single delivery to him was fucking flawless in the last 3 overs.",15
Pattinson's workload management will last for one game thanks to NCN,7
Coulter Nile looks out of touch,2
Very good score considering how it was looking ~8 overs in,3
That might be the first and last game for NCN lol,4
Cum god and (M)orgasm God,12
lmao this was shit bowling eh?,5
Fuck me that's some classic Morgan right there,10
Everyone talking about Cummins 15 cr but everyone forgot Coulter Nike's 9 cr,9
Morgan is a beast.,2
Inb4 Mumbai Indians chase that in 15 overs.,4
Is this the lowest 1st innings total this season ?,3
"Rohit gave NCN the over just to build up his confidence. He would have given Pollard otherwise, but it's important to build up the confidence of someone who has just joined the team, showing some trust. If it comes at cost of 6-8 runs, so be it",3
I know we will lose but atleast we scored some runs,3
Mfw best Australian batsman this IPL is Pat Cummins,7
"Coulter-nile performed so bad, he was responsible for 1/3rd of the total score.",11
fuck this shit,4
Now watch MI chase this with two overs to spare. Without Naraine MI should not have any grave issues chasing it.,4
Is this Cummins's first fifty?,6
Decent score from KKR. Now it's up to Morgan's captaincy,6
"Even if KKR lose this match, I think most people will be satisfied with Morgan as a captain.",6
"Morgan played that well. Needed to stabilise things when they were 5 down, then gave Cummins the strike as he was aggressive, then finished it off at the end",14
Shit for MI,3
NCN literally bowling length at 130ks at the death. Asking to get hit,8
"What a horrendous ending for MI. How could you give away that many runs, it's like they pulled an inverse DC",10
This is what Pattinson died for,8
Cummins looks gassed already. Could this affect his bowling?,15
NCN Madarchod,-3
From my cellar I have pulled out the finest bottle of Mishty Doi. Will open it after KKR win.,7
35 off the last 2,7
Partnership of 87 in 56 ball,5
[deleted],1
Turns out NCN is just Pattinson who can bat,4
Can Mumbai bat like a meme team only for tonight please.,9
"T20 score of 145 in 2020 = ODI score of 215 in the 90s.

...something that they can bowl at....",3
"With the batsmen remaining in the tank, Morgan's risk free inning makes a lot of sense",9
Is the pitch bad for batting or did MI bowl well?,5
Show some respecc to mah boi cummo,7
Took a bowler batting to take them close to 150. I can't understand why the batsmen can't keep their wickets literally every game!,9
"Ravi Shastri had a goatee once but quickly shaved it off.  
  
Thodi der ke liye goatee muh me tha",16
[deleted],-7
[deleted],7
The real reason hotstar doesn't let us take the screenshots is because they don't want their ass quality livestream exposed.,10
I'd open with Chakravarthy. QdK could be sus against mystery spin,4
Well played Patty Cummins. Got his team out of a shit place.,8
Good comeback by KKR. Now watch MI make the pitch look like a road. Chased in 16 overs I reckon,12
Don't think KKR have the bowling to defend this tbh,6
Wow mature knock from Morgan üëèüëè,17
"I mean in fairnest to Morgan, if he played for more shots throughout and he got out, they'd probably have been bowled out for like 110 already. 

He was sensible.",44
Give the strike to the batsman who was finding the boundaries often and then plunder the last over after luring the fielding side into a false sense of security. Genius.,14
But the question is if KKR can defend it?,7
Season over for NCN?,5
Can Chris Green bat?,6
"Good finish but I don't see us defending 148, especially against MI and when Narine is missing as well.",7
Retards with 30iq blaming Morgan for the lower score rather than the shitty 5 batsmen getting out for 61.,15
"Lol KKR paid for a bowler and got a batsman in Pat

Cries in SRH",44
"Horrendous bowling at the end. Didn't respect Cummins' batting at all and served him some trash, while the last over was full of balls in the slot for Morgan.",0
"Shocking death bowling. 

Dollies gifted by NCN to Morgan after all his struggles. And Cummins has hit that exact shot to get his 50, like 5 or 6 times in this innings.. yet MI didn't bother to plug it up.",3
"Happy for Cummins. That high price tag must have been putting a lot of pressure on him, hope this eases it.",8
Had Morgan started this a bit earlier we could have reached 160+. Although most of it down to our batsmen being shit all season.,6
Beginning is the end and end is the beginning,4
I never want to see Coulter-Nile be in the playing XI for Mumbai again,2
"It should be illegal to be as good a bowler as Cummins, and bat like that.",15
Ambani feels so overpowered for IPL. Time for Adani to enter,12
Narine would have been killer on this surface. FeelsBadMan.jpg,8
"Anyone else excited to see what Chris Green can do? I expect him to open the bowling, he‚Äôs absolutely dominated the CPL with many first ball strikes and often takes 1-2 more wickets while being super economical.",7
NCN will get one more match MI won't drop him.,3
Disappointing to have 4 top order wickets and then to allow Pat to score 56. But that's T20,14
Morgan - Cummins partnership changed this entire match. Sensible batting .,29
Morgan played smartly today taking deep and playing 2nd fiddle to Cummins. His wicket would have opened up the tailenders risking an all-out under 120.,23
"Mumbai always stick with their overseas bowlers for a bit . That‚Äôs how they mcclenagan , Mitch Johnson became gun bowlers in ipl. They need the match practice for NCN. Always good to have backup .",6
Dinesh Karthik is still shit. Why do they even play him,-4
Surely MI are gonna win this?,8
Why did Pattinson not play today. He has been really reallygood except 1 match. NCN hasnt bowled for 6 months. This is terrible from MI.,9
So bowling a replacement player over a 9 cr player was a good decision after all,6
Guys Am I actually that high or did I legit see one of the weirdest claps ever from a lady in the crowd on Cummins 50?,11
"KKR paid Russell big money for his batting but got Russell the bowler this season

KKR paid Cummins big money for his bowling but got Cummins the batsman this season",24
5D chess from Rohit Sharma. Tire out Cummins before he comes on to bowl,39
"Where did coronavirus come from?  
  
Ravi Shastri: From the meat of the bat",19
Courter-Nile was and is a beast for KKR.,20
Cummins has scored more runs than Russell lol.,7
For people shitting on NCN - it's his first match,16
I think we still r in the game with an outside chance,7
"If Cummins bowls as well as he has batted, KKR can really defend it.",4
Qdk better score another 50 to make up for his drop on Cummins,9
"When Morgan plays slow :

This sub : Oh dear. Oh dear. Gorgeous




When DK plays slow :

This Sub : You fucking donkey.",31
I mean you can't really expect NCN to be on his game in his first IPL game but he was bowling some pies to Cummins and Morgan. Fielding was really rusty by MI except for that catch from Sky.,7
So they said hitting the balls is hard on thus pitch because ball is staying low and skidding. Guess we will see,1
Why aren‚Äôt they playing Narine doesn‚Äôt he still have one warning left ?,2
"Russell is like:

Power: 100

Timing: 80

Brain: 0",12
"This sub 
Whoever performs on the day - person is god 
Whoever fails - this guy is trash . Fuck him .",16
"In spite of people's dissatisfaction with Morgan, I say it was a great knock by him given the circumstances.

Had he tried to be more aggressive and gotten out in the process, there was no guarantee that others coming in would've been able to do both of being more aggressive than Morgan and also preserve their wicket.",21
MI will probably chase it down with 20 balls left.,1
"I think it‚Äôs time KKR bowled Cummins 1 up front, 1 in the middle and 2 at the death. It‚Äôs too easy for opposition teams to see him out and then attack other players.",2
Does anyone remember that match where srh scored something like 118 against mi and actually defended it?,6
People be calling Eoin Thala for strike rotation at the death but forgetting KKR were on there way to 100 all out,19
"Pat Cummins has scored more runs and hit more sixes than Andre Russel this IPL.

Russell has picked more wickets at a better SR than Cummins.

UNO reverse.",80
What a recovery by the purple teletubbies!! GGWP,3
[deleted],-8
Kkr might just pull this off. Cummings will be pumped up,5
Wow Cummins who is a bowler hit bumrah . What good is bumrah if a tail ended can hit him . Bumrah is trash,-11
"Good finish for KKR and all, but no excuse to not chase this down. Especially if Cummins can score a 50.",5
MI gonna destroy KKR‚Äôs NRR tonight,-1
"Russel is becoming a concern , hasn't fired in a long time .His bowling is good but doesn't really fit his role.

Same with Cummins batting good but failing to pick early wickets , he's been economical though.",12
I'm not gonna get political but some of yall really need to look inward for how you treat Morgan vs dk or any other captain,9
Key for KKR is to get rid of Cock under 5 runs. He is a slimy little bugger who scores around 20-30 runs but lays a great platform for the rest of the batting order.,6
"People saying Morgan should have started striking early...bro kkr wouldn't have reached this much, if he had gotten out early on....",25
Lara says Russell hasn't improved his game. Ma man dishing truth.,25
"Morgan batted more responsibly. 
Captaincy effect.",19
"Morgan played a sensible knock, if he got out early they may have been bowled out for 120. 148 might still be a few runs below par but it gives them something to bowl at.",30
"Cummins: ""Look at me, I'm Russell now""",13
"Alright Mumbai, do your thing. Make this 148 below par score in 10 overs.",-7
I mean 148-5 is not a bad score to chase at all but I feel like MI is gonna lose to KKR and that hurts because KKR-MI matchup has been the most one-sided matchup ever. I remember in the first IPL when I was a kid and MI lost 4 in 4 in the first IPL( was in teras as Gilchrist destroyed MI with a hundred) and out 5th and 7th matches were with KKR which we won extremely handily and gave us a chance back in the tournament.,4
"KKR should try Russell as opener once, he can make use of that PP",4
I reckon Mumbai will be 2 down for not much and it'll take a Pollard special if we are to win this.,-1
Perfect script for Coulter-Nile to hit the winning runs off the last ball and redeem himself.,4
Green better get some wickets up front,2
Not feeling confident about the chase. Pitch is slightly two paced and KKR have plenty of variation in their bowling attack.,1
Sharma and Cock to chase this in 9.4 overs,1
Mumbai will probably chase it down by the 16th over,7
"Cummins and Morgan have saved them from humiliation, this could have ended in double digits only. Terrific recovery",19
If there would be no in person attendance why not just host the IPL in India ?,1
Just realised that there was no total less than 140 this season. That's a stunner.,1
"DC was able to defend below par score, but MI batting is lot consistent than RR",5
"Relax guys don't hate on NCN, he bowled after so many matches!!Deep down we all know MI is gonna win this,Rohit took the sensible decision to let NCN bowl this increasing his confidence and showing trust in him,Plus NCN can bat too like Ben Cutting,he was good in WC 19,don't hate on him pls and why Pattinson isn't playing is because MI want to experiment with the team strategy and if NCN is better than Pattinson or not bcoz the team formation is important for the playoffs,btw incredibly good effort from Cummins and Morgan,the team can hold up in batting collapses,good to see the new captain leading from the front,Good luck KKR for the match.

I am rooting for MI tonight!!!
Go Paltan!!!",20
"If anyone has to be blamed today

Its gill for slogging when he is given an anchor role

N dk for playing an irresponsible lap shot when an wicket has fall just 1 ball b4",10
SharmaJi please don't let us down.,7
BC DC fans tryna jinx,5
Should have stopped KKR at 130.,6
Mumbai has a RCB habit of not chasing low score.,10
"Cummins

N chris green shud open the bowling",4
"It's crazy how the result dictates who is terrible and good.

Last ball you get a boundary to win the match, you played great, opposition was terrible.

Last ball you almost get a boundary but lose, you played terrible, opposition did great.

Literally one ball and everything else both teams did doesn't matter.",3
I maintain MI has one (Bumrah) and a half (Boult opening spell) high class bowler which is not enough to win the tournament. Their spinners are alright but not exactly world beaters.,-10
Russell and Dk is just a liability now.,-1
"Cummins, what a inning man!!!. He has scored more than Hetmyer, Maxwell (duh!) and reaching Dhoni, Kartik...might have crossed today...

Now after all that 10 overs of batting he gotta bowl those 145+ balls",10
r/Cricket is full of numbskulls who think that a good strike rate is the only thing that can win a T20 match. Sad.,8
"People comparing Morgan‚Äôs innings to what Dhoni‚Äôs been doing need to understand that he had to come in at a crisis, IN THE FIRST innings and acknowledged that Cummins on the other end was striking it cleanly. 

Difference is, Dhoni in 2020 comes in at 100/4 after 15 overs chasing 170 and then bats conservatively till its like 50 to win in 12 balls.",21
[deleted],-6
"Wtf, is this the 2nd time that Cummins has top scored for his team in this IPL season? Never thought i would ever see this sentence",18
"Cummings missed the opportunity to print ""Pat here"" on his shirt.",8
Brendo wants Captain Morgan but,1
"I don't know which season it happened(either last year or last to last), but MI absolutely botched a straight forward chase against SRH.",8
"Either MI chase this in a canter, or Morgan and his bowlers flex on MI",1
"Heard alot about green, should see what he's about!",4
"Pretty glorious opportunity for Morgan to cement his captaincy. If they lose it'll be on the top order batsman failing to perform, if they win he'll probably get a lot of the credit, along with the bowlers, for managing to defend a small total.",10
"If qdk faces first ball: brohit

If rohit faces first ball: nohit",9
Bats like Maxwell and Russell getting exposed af this season because pitches aren't India,8
This match has been so fun to watch with y'all. Wouldn't be as enjoyable without y'all,9
Hahaha... Quinnie just walked out in his training trousers!,14
QDK 's pants seem different.,7
I am low key excited for RCB vs MI,9

Umm was Russell wearing two different pair of shoes ?,3
Is narine banned?,4

Yadav would've not been too bad. Y this vote of jo confidence ?,0
Kkr have not lost bowling second this ipl though and they have won two lost causes in them. Surely they can't do it thrice?,1

KKR should swap Kuldeep with DC for Rahane,5
"If KKR lose today, then SRH‚Äôs next game against them could be a major turning in the tournament. They will play each other day after tomorrow(18th).",11
Ok it's Brohit today,3
Rohit hitting with legs,2
Cummo has to be hyper aggressive today if we have any chance to win,1
Rohit always remembers Eden Gardens while playing against KKR,6
As far as I'm concerned if a bowler is reported for a suspect action and has to remodel it they should be disallowed from wearing long sleeves or anything else that covers their elbow at least for a certain amount of games.,6
"Runs

Cummins: 126
Russell: 83

Wickets:

Cummins: 2
Russell: 6

Just play Cummins as a specialist batsman at this point,3
Chris Green was playing and he didn't bat? Wow,4
Why have they given rohit the runs from 4 lbs?,1
6 runs already from the balls drifting on the pads.,2

Terrible fielding,6
SKY enjoyed that fielding blunder,6
Mumbai Indians this year remind me of the villian team from space jam lmao,12

Bish sounding genuinely disappointed in Cummins is quite funny,7
Just give MI the trophy already,15
Looks like I can go to sleep earlier today,12
"Ok if there's Chris Green playing, where's my Lockie Ferguson",13
Ian Bishop sounds like a disappointed dad when talking about Cummins.,18
Cumdog challenge: Give away less runs than he made...,20
Rohit is in no mood to stretch the match,29
Play Cummo as a batsman against mi,19
Guys upvote every comment to maintain universal balance,11
Mavi + Cummins is a better opening pair imo,4

How many times does rohit have to show this shot for bowlers to learn to not bowl him there,21
Rohit absolutely hates KKR,12
A bowler should think of bowling short to Rohit only is he bowls at like 170 kmph.,5
"The way cameraman stopped, I thought he was caught",2
Congratulations Mumbai Indians for the win,7
"Hot take: As Indian I never got the Cummins hype, only time he impressed me was in 2018 test series by taking 3 wickets inside 2 overs but by that time india already had 300+ lead in that match. 2 million dollars Bowler? Lmao üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠",-6

Don't bowl bouncer to Rohit prasidh,13
He is never out of form against kkr and I'm not complaining,17

"R we fucked now?? 

This is the reason i fucking hate MI",-5
Rohit Sharma is so beautiful to watch.. that is an incredibly hard shot to get right to pace bowlers..,18
They're gonna chase it within 15 overs,8
Mumbai is top of the table for this reason. Delhi too. No player thinks they‚Äôre precious and holds onto their wicket. No batdeep. Just try to keep the momentum going,18
Prasidh modelled his action after Brett Lee but is bowling like Siraj,17
"Gets swing first ball. Bowls short rest of the over.

How braindead are these guys really?",12

Ok the pant thing is hilarious. He just wanted to end this match quickly,3
"DK , Cummins,Russel,Rana , Kuldeep

SRK needs to play for KKR when they're facing MI,2
"De kock is cummin hard.

I had to do it",7
KKR sends a batsman to bowl and get super shocked when he gets hit for 2 fours. Smh,11
The fact that Krunal bowls out a lot of games shows MI management see a lot of value in him than what r/cricket shows... listening to this sub you would think he‚Äôs a shit cricketer,17

Either makes this a thriller or finish it off in 12-14 overs.,4

Spinners work better against both of these guys.,0
Why is it such a big deal to wear training pant instead of actual? I don't get the fuss. Does it bring some repercussions for QdK?,2
Why are people using smileys on match thread? Is this thread being overtaken by normies?,-4
Dog shit bowler,0
Bowled Him,2
RCB did a huge mistake by releasing QdK. Gun opening batsman instead of Finch. No wicketkeeping burden on ABD. But then again making sensible decisions is asking too much from RCB management.,8
"Not having a full auction before next year is very very bad news for KKR!

They do not even have any serious injury concerns this year as an excuse for this kind of a performance!",4

"Qdk dropped one now he's dropped.

Perfectly balanced",11
"KKR just have to improve their batting, their bowling, and their fielding. And, they will be very good team!",14
KKR should have played Lockie  Ferguson alongside Cummins and tried to emulate what  Rabada+ Nortje are doing. Chris green is equivalent of Axar and Krunal.,11
What happened to Narine?,1
Fckn sell-out umpire,-2
"Wickets, come on. 10 to go.",9
Why is Quinton swinging at literally everything? It's okay your pants don't look that bad,31

This is how u start when chasing 150. Just keep attacking . Not play dots and let the pressure build .,3
Interesting how a Big over in the dugout means 15+ whereas it used to be 10+ in pre IPL/T20 era,8

So Explain why DC fans are so cocky. They haven't won yet.,3
QDK is in such fine form.,2
Strategic Timeout Happens- QDK tum log banao strategy mein change karke aa raha hu,3
This is how you play as openers in T20. Not that cautious tuk tuk shit,3
So. Many. Pies.,2
Do fantasy points take into the context of the game (like cricinfo‚Äôs smart stats) or are they fixed? I.e you get the same points if a batsman scores 50(25) or 50(42)? Some of the top fantasy points make no sense.,3
"Why krishna now lol

Is morgan tryna bowl him out",3
What happened to that Fizz bowler for SRH?,5
Why would you give the guy who just got pummeled for 18 another over when you have Mavi waiting. Fucking hell,5

NRR gonna skyrocket,8
I'm probably wrong but i rate Buttler and De Cock the same,9
"SKY is a number three you'll be happy to see coming in at both 0/1 and 140/1. His versatility is incredible.

I don't think there is any other number three in the IPL who can do both the jobs with such elan. Not even Kohli, IMO.",15
Dekock is hard today,2

Wrong pants De Kock is the GOAT,8
Winning is overrated,11
De Kock six with 69 metres. Let the memes flowüòÇ,17
At this rate QDK should drop a catch every match,5
QD should drop.a catch every match,8
I love how QDK makes up for that dropped catch,7
"I remember some friend of mine telling me a few games earlier that if QdK finds form, MI is gonna be unstoppable. He is not wrong.",14

Ok Prasidh is losing his line after his first cracker ball...,8
"A team with no wicket taking bowler, kkr did poor at auctions",7
69m six by De Cock. Niiiiice,12
Damn quinnie is saying the age old immortal phrase that every cricketer utters when we meme them into form: fuck r/cricket.,4

"Quinny dropped Cummins so that he would have more runs to score when he bats

Galaxy brain move",10
why no shivam mavi or varun chakravarty till now?,1
Apparently Lord Robin Uthappa wanted KKR captaincy in 2018 after Gambhir left,10
"I think Krunal‚Äôs bowling is super under appreciated. Remember, because of Hardik‚Äôs back injury, Krunal is forced to bowl 4 overs almost every game. Teams are definitely aware of that and would target him. Still his economy rate is very good and rivals specialist spinners.",13
Man dekock must feel really guilty about the catch.,6

Probably should have played Lockie instead of Green,3

"8 wins confirm playoff spot, right?",2
Gambhir Asking all the right questions,11
DK to Morgan: 'Not so easy is it',10
KKR should let Kuldeep go. That's better for his career.,22
"Captain plays such an important role in cricket...

And I don't understand why football teams have captains when you have coach/manager screaming from sidelines...",13
I long for the day when Morgan will ask his bowlers to bowl full into the pads trying for bowled and LBWs. Seen him bowl way too short for years now. Specially when YJB and Root have fallen to those kind of balls for years. Just try it once and I won‚Äôt ever doubt you again,6
Why did they hold back Varun for so long. Did nobody remember that both the openers have wonky record against spin?,6

900D chess by De Cock to drop Cummins so that Cummins gets more runs and De Cock gets a big target and De Cock can make his 50 to remain in the team and not get dropped.,14
"Rohit -----> Morgan

De kock -----> Cummins

Exact parallels",10
Thats why a team like Mumbai succeeds. Phillipe was dropped after 2-3 matches by RCB whereas Mumbai stuck with Qdk even after his bad form throughout,11
"Kkr need a reboot, opt out of tournament and wait for auctions",2
Fuck Orange cap my homie de Cock wears orange pants,21

Which team can beat  MI?,2
Irfan Pathan = Mute,4
"Below average bowlers, star players who have depreciated due to not improving their game, unstable team leadership, lack of agility in working on finding a combination that works and playing underperforming players for too long. Making same mistakes every match.

I am waiting for De Cock's Ipl century!!!,8
"On a serious note, if he wanted to try Krishna for 1 over that was fine. But when it didnt work, Mavi should've been on. You cannot expect a captain to guess, but continuing a bad move is fair criticism.",15
I think what‚Äôs clear from this is to be successful you need to to build your team around top tier Indian players. The overseas players need to fill in gaps and holes you have afterwards that‚Äôs where it works best because you only get 4 and can swap them around. However if you build a team around core foreign players you get hit really hard when one or more them of flop for several games.,26
I think Mavi has a better chance to play for India more than Nagarkotti,6
Is this pant?,8
I have been enjoying cricinfos post match show. Deep Dasgupta and Ian bishop are pretty good .,15

How does any team stop this Mumbai team.  I would say the best batting side in the league and 2nd best bowling side after DC (close to 1st).
