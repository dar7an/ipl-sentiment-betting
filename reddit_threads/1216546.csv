Both have had a pretty similar season with the bat. 

They've both had one match winning knock (Iyer vs KKR Sharjah and Kohli vs CSK) but barring that, they've largely stat padded and not shown enough intent. They've been reliant on other batsmen to finish the job off and they've often got out at the worst time imaginable after consuming a lot of balls. 

Will be interesting to see if either of them improve today or go the same old ""construct the innings"" slowly because clearly it's not working and it's hurting the side.",5

Look at the lineup today. After AB at 4, they have Sundar and Dube at 5 and 6 lol. There is no doubt that all these guys up to Morris Udana can bat, but will you trust any of these guys, Dube included, to get you over the line with say 80 needed off 9 overs with 5 wickets in hand? I doubt it. 

Because they're fielding 4 specialist batsmen, Koach plays conservatively and RCB are reliant on AB magic to pull them out of a hole every single time. 

Paddikal is a star, make no mistake. But it shouldn't be his responsibility to be scoring 50 off 40 balls and trying to bat 15 overs. That's bullshit. Padikkal should ideally be batting 7-8 overs and getting 40 (24) and set a platform for the side. Anything else should be a bonus.

But if you take out the 90(52) and 72(53) (which I take out because the 90 is clearly an outlier for this season, and the 72 which was fine because it was a low chase), he has scored 298 runs in 272 balls this season. That is horrendous.

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

Divide game into first 15 overs and last 5 overs:

# First 15 overs

 - Play out Boult 2 overs. Aim to get 6-10 runs but no wickets. Smash if he bowls more. 

 - Play out Bumrah 2 overs. Aim to get 6-10 runs but no wickets. 

 - Krunal/Pollard: must go for 50 runs in 4 overs even if you lose 2-3 wickets.

 - Pattison/NCN/Chahar: 8 runs an over. Maybe lose one wicket.

If you have done this right, you are at 130 after 15 overs with 4 down.

# Last 5 overs

- Smash 10 an over irrespective of who bowls.

You have 180 which should be enough batting wise. The most important aspect of this is to play out Boult opening spell which really hurts them a lot.",5

If they continue this way, even with a good PP of 50 runs, they will still end up scoring just 100 runs by 14th over mark. This puts too much pressure on ABD to score loads at the death.
