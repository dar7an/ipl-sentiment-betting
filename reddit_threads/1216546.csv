"If y'all remember, both teams were in a similar position, playing eachother in 2016. Loser would get knocked out, winner would take the #2 spot.",5
"Delhi Capitals likely to play Daniel Sams in place of Hetmyer in the do or die match against RCB. 

\- [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/CricCrazyJohns/status/1323199816537497600)",8
"From MI's perspective, I think DC is the better opposition to face in the qualifier. DC is a good team but Kohli and ABD are long due for big scores and they generally do well against MI.",10
How did we come to this? Fuck me sideways,5
One of the players DC have lowkey missed is Amit Mishra. A proper wicket taker in the middle overs. Axar and Ashwin have been good but in T20 leggies remain the best bet to pick wickets.,7
"**Last 5 matches** for the both the teams in this season (latest first)

**DC:** L L L L W

**RCB:** L L L W W",3
"Rcb loses to dc by >20-25 runs Or dc beats rcb in 17.1 overs

Mi loses to srh by playing their reserve squad against srh

And then.... I'll concede that 2020 has some good things about it",2

"I'm so conflicted. I want a close match, but I also want one of these teams knocked out for the memes.",6
Haa best game of ipl. Here we go. Expecting some great drama,5
Went to college only to find out I have no lessons today. Came back home. Either the stars are aligned for something spectacular for RCB or terrible. 😭😭,2

At least one team will break it's loosing streak today.,61
"Atleast one of us will be happy by the end

What a shitty way to end after the start they both got",5
You can cut the tension with a knife,5
If we somehow bottle it and lose the playoff spot that's me off any cricket social media for at least two weeks. Which sucks because cricket is pretty much what I spend most of my time watching and reading online,5
Cue *Hanuman Chalisa*,43
I'm fucking terrified.,8
Come on delhi  win this for Ponting,7
[deleted],4
last game we will see either the rcb or dc flairs here for a long time,4
"As a RCB fan win or lose today, this was a real good season. After many season we have seen bowlers win matches for us. Fingers crossed 🤞. I am mentally prepared for the memes and trolls coming our way.",4

Imagine if one of them goes WWW and gets the trophy.",6

"What's the scenario for qualifying for us, lads?",1
Let’s go Bangalore! Yuthu kanditha win madbeku,9
The fact that it’s come down to this match after the kind of position both these teams were in at the halfway point is so hilarious!!🤣🤣,34
Aight boys prepare yourselves for the inevitable shit show,4
If RCB choke this then normality will be returned with KXIP & RCB imploding to not make the playoffs.,4
Hoping for the best today.,1
"Both teams just need to avoid a big defeat to qualify right?

Can't see it happening though, one side will smash the other lmao",3
"DC have lost a wicket in the opening over in eight of their 13 matches. Interestingly, the only side that hasn't picked a wicket in their first over of bowling this season is RCB. 

~ Cricbuzz",45
How badly these two need to lose for KKR to overtake them?,1
Don’t care who wins but I just want them to show some fight. Hoping for a close match,4
We're gonna lose 5 in a row today letzoooooooo,7
"MI vs RCB final will be so heated 🔥 after their last match , both team will fight for each runs",4
Please RCB. Please. This is not the day to be chokers. Just not today.,8
"Delhi, best of luck.",1
Both Kohli and ABD are due for runs. Hopefully they fire today.,1
Just as I was getting over Saturday's disappointment.. Here we go once again,11
"Loved the fact that this IPL will have a grand total of 0 dead rubbers. Excellent advertisement for the league.

That aside, hoping for a good game.",16
"RCB has a dreaaaam bowling and just has everything going their way, They are so winning this x(",-2

"I have to decided to take up no nut November challenge as a sacrifice to the Cricketing gods to help win RCB this season ipl and also no shave November for DC.
I have an interview tommorow and instagram is really throwing up some thirst pics",45
This match is when a  stopabble force meets a movable object,31
"My prediction :

RCB To make 200+

Delhi chasing, Prithvi goes for a 0, Delhi looks in all sorts of trouble, but what's this  It's Virender Sehwag walking from the dugout, wearing the 2012 Delhi Daredevils jersey! Sehwag will blast 50 off 22 and then Dhawan gets out caught. Delhi looks in all sorts of trouble after which Ponting smirks. *The cavelry has arrived* he says with a smile after which Kevin Pietersen walks out and the Delhi Daredevils theme starts playing in the stadium. They make a partnership and take Delhi home.

Delhi fans wake up after this",122
Koach's record in pressure games is giving me serious anxiety :(,2
"After all the trauma that RCB and DC fans have been through over past 3-4 matches, one of them finally get a happy ending :)",4
I just want it to be a good fight,3
Can we just agree to a close match? KKR has enough titles already.,25
Am I the only one that feels bad that toss plays a major role with these matches irrespective of teams strengths? Win the toss and you have better chances at your fortune,2
The biggest meme match of this IPL with the highest stakes and NRR drama.,26
"I just want to Virat to perform really well this match

This season is due a VK special.",4
"I don't know if there was ever such a high-voltage match in playoffs. The winner gets 2nd position and the loser fears elimination. Both teams are hungry for a win after losing their last 3/4 matches.  Moreover, it is a matter of pride since both teams have played some exceptional cricket this season but alas both are also big chokers. This is gonna be fun!",18
The stoppable force vs the movable object,36
You know what I love guys ? Delhi Daredevils will never be able to win a IPL trophy 😂,2
May the best team win by a big margin😂,15
"I’m terrified because RCB have experienced players who can perform under pressure most of the time. 
Delhi on the other hand are cracking under pressure. 
Pant is not who he used to be, but we need him to step up today.",3

"I want dc to choke after a good pp start, when rcb comes to bat, trying to chase an easy total, I hope they'll choke harder, so much so that it'll put the king of choking of this ipl (kxip) to shame and rcb rightfully take back their title of ""ultimate chokers""

"I didn't get any work done today waiting for this match

Mfs better win today",27
"Many people expecting either rcb or dc to lose badly

All this meanwhile koach and iyer make a bro pact of not defeating the opponent by big margins",10
I hope the bandwagon toxic fans from both sides have changed loyalties. Og fans know this is just another season for both teams lol,6
"Prediction time:

Match declared a tie and both teams make it to playoff",10
RCB fans prepare for trouble and make it double because we know exactly where we're at and what's coming our way.,3
Very very controversial and unpopular opinion but I feel SRH is going to win the title this year.,1
Since yesterday I have been waiting for this match. Now that the moment is here I'm nervous af,3
RCB should play Moeen or Finch to shore up the middle order. Cannot have your batting ending at no 4.,1

I want this to be a thriller but I'm certain it's going to be a one sided cluster fuck,3
"It's my humble request to both sides especially the new Delhi fans, whoever wins , stay humble about it and don't rub it onto the other",7
By what margin should either team lose or win for both to qualify?,1

Is there anything stopping DC and RCB just coming to a gentleman's agreement to take the game to 18+ overs? Like yeah its horrible but its is illegal?,5

Any free live streaming link for the match????,1

"I'm intrigued for the Kohli vs Iyer (batting vs batting) battle. 

Both have had a pretty similar season with the bat. 

They've both had one match winning knock (Iyer vs KKR Sharjah and Kohli vs CSK) but barring that, they've largely stat padded and not shown enough intent. They've been reliant on other batsmen to finish the job off and they've often got out at the worst time imaginable after consuming a lot of balls. 

Will be interesting to see if either of them improve today or go the same old ""construct the innings"" slowly because clearly it's not working and it's hurting the side.",5

"This is how it will go, there will be a chase-able total, we will start decent then boundaries will start drying up which will result in batsmen taking pressure, that pressure will lead to wickets and we will collapse in no time.

Alright boys ready for another classic rcb collapse? And koach saying we were 20 runs short,22
"Yes okay Rahane has to play like a collapse preventer, fully expect Stoinis and Dhawan to open today",7
From wining games consistently without a change to trying to find the right players and making panic changes... RCB and DC have come a long way,11
"4 foreign fast bowlers, nice",8
So if they make 160 DC can make 145 and still qualify?,10
"What is that DC pace attack?!!

This season really only had 1 op team. I think thats a first for ipl,8
Atleast Koach didnt back that Gurkeerat mf this time,13
Both RCB and DC fans just shitting on themselves ITT. Must be seriously fun for all the other fans watching the meltdown in the next 40 overs?,6
Iyer and sUpeR V have made the pact to take it deep right?,1
I miss the Pant of old who single-handedly saved 3 or so games last year,7
No disrespect to the current female hosts for star sports but they lack cricketing knowledge unlike Mayanthi Langer who used to ask genuine cricketing questions.. Watching these hosts not able to answer these simple questions in super over is really sad... Hopefully next year we get Mayanthi back or maybe the second baby is on the cards,9
"Just a friendly reminder we lost against DC this season and we lost by 59 runs when Rabada and Nortje took 6 wickets and now add Sams with them.

:(",9
"The only way we would've won is if we won the damn toss. But nope, looks like we've gotta pack our bags and go home now",5
"It was pleasure supporting RCB till now.Now that we are not ahead anymore, I gotta pick one for playoffs now. Thinking to just stick with MI for the sake of mental health.",6
Supporters from both teams are pretty confident that they'll lose today.,26
Won't be surprised if RCB bring back Shaw's runs and KGs wickets.,21
[deleted],3
"DC is going in with three overseas fast bowlers, add Stoinis as fourth overseas pacer. Is this a first?",1
So you're telling me Shimron 'BIGBOOTY^TM' Hetmyr isn't playin this match?,4
Lmao being a delhi and rcb fan..my nerves are wrecking..hope they make it a close match that's all my request,9
[deleted],4
Congratulations on the top two spot Delhi.,10
The 2nd last game of the league stage between the 2nd and 3rd place teams has the potential to become a memefest. What an IPL this has been.,6
Paddikal no 45(33) please...this is a race for NRR you tortoise,6
Inb4 rabada gets Kohli again,3
ngl I'd prefer Unmukt Chand to Rahane,6
C’mon Rcb pls bring me some joy in 2020,6
Sams was impressive in that 1 game he played. Deserved to be back. This is our best possible bowling lineup honestly. That indian pacer position was not working out at all,3
[deleted],1
"I swear if theres nothing in the pitch for spinners today....


I'll cry",1
Is Dan Sams handy with the bat?,3
"Our bowling looks veryyy tasty, Sams is good with new ball. Nortje Sams + Ashwin in PP. Rabada for later. Letzooooooo",6
"Anyone else think Shivam Dube was fast tracked to Team India before he matures, just because he happens to be in RCB?",3
Really hope Padikkal gets us off to a flyer and continues to accelerate,3
"Just feel bad for Finchy, like he’s one of the best T20I opening batsmen. Hopefully he manages to click in the IPL someday.",2
"If Rcb score more than 180, I think we are looking for a complete batting collapse for DD like RR yesterday",5
"Today I [learnt](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/report/392212/deccan-chargers-vs-mumbai-indians-32nd-match-indian-premier-league-2009) that Rohit Sharma has taken a hat-trik in IPL. While playing for Deccan Chargers. Against Mumbai Indians. 

IPL is crazy.",7
Please lose badly if you do. No point in going to playoffs after losing 5 in a row.,9
"DC play 3 fast bowlers and we play 3 spinners, a medium pacer and a guy who only bowls slower balls

This better work out",9
YES IT'S FUCKING DANIEL SAMS CUNT. AUSTRALIA'S BEST KEPT SECRET. THE FUCKING CHAD HIMSELF,8
Why is Saini out?,3
"ABD and VK are beasts when chasing; given dew and RCB batting first, advantage DC to begin with",9
[deleted],6
"That's the game done and dusted. Saini out is a huge blow, and a horrible toss to lose",9
"I think, if RCB scores between 140-170, the match will be close and both would qualify. Else, it'll be one-sided.",3
[deleted],17
When was the last time an IPL team played 4 foreign fast bowling options.,4
Damn KP backing his one-ex (RCB) over the other.,3
"delhi bowling looks strong

 Axar Patel,  R Ashwin,  Kagiso Rabada,  Anrich Nortje,  Daniel Sams",7
Imagine if it's last ball of 2nd innings and DC are losing but can go through with a six of last ball. Daniel Sams hits a six like Tare and is never seen again,8
Kohli 1(3) lbw D Sams would be _tasty_,5
Rcb on there way to score either 200+ or all out for 135. There is no in-between,6
No weakness in DC bowling today Kohli should get to tuk-tuk mode & protect our batting today & pray for one more ABD superhuman inning,7
Man love  Brain Lara ... No bullshit just straight up facts,3
Who won the toss? Who's going to bat first?,5
"Don't expect anything, yet I am here. Goddamn you DC.",1
"RCB: 147/5 -- V. Kohli 21(22), ABD 15(11), DDP 43(40)

DC: 150/2 -- 17.2 overs. Dhawan 68*(50), Iyer 22*(16)",5
"Their batting lineup is up till ninth lmao, no way they are getting knocked out",2
"RCB has pure batsmen till 4 followed by 5 allrounders. This has hurt them.

Look at DC. They literally have 7 players who've scored centuries for their country.",8
I think the safe score for both teams will be around 160. Rcb will hope to defend it in 18 overs and the fact that DC won't go hard for quick finish. On other hand DC will target 145 and then go for the win,1
If Dan Sams bowls 145 again today I am absolutely not going to believe the speed guns ever again,2
"**Question for DC and RCB fans**,

If you had choice to play **ONE** player from teams that are out of the race, whom would you chose and why?",2
I hope we atleast get to 180 so that it would be tough for DC to chase within 17 overs. Then even if we lose we'll qualify.,6
[deleted],6
"Lets be clear, one of these teams is losing badly. Meme teams dont do close wins/losses when they need them.",4
"A middle order of Shreyas, Rahane and Pant. 100 loading...off 100 balls",7
Let’s see how I’ll die just a little bit more today on the inside,5
"DC has been playing so bad, and RCB fans here are still worried lol",8
Didn't think I'd see the day that Siraj gets picked over Saini,-4
"RCB really need to buy some specialist Indian batsmen next season. If not experienced ones, at least youngsters like Garg, Parag (not them, but players like them) who are proper batsmen and not ""can bat"" all rounders or sloggers. 

Look at the lineup today. After AB at 4, they have Sundar and Dube at 5 and 6 lol. There is no doubt that all these guys up to Morris Udana can bat, but will you trust any of these guys, Dube included, to get you over the line with say 80 needed off 9 overs with 5 wickets in hand? I doubt it. 

Because they're fielding 4 specialist batsmen, Koach plays conservatively and RCB are reliant on AB magic to pull them out of a hole every single time. 

Paddikal is a star, make no mistake. But it shouldn't be his responsibility to be scoring 50 off 40 balls and trying to bat 15 overs. That's bullshit. Padikkal should ideally be batting 7-8 overs and getting 40 (24) and set a platform for the side. Anything else should be a bonus. 

Chahal and AB have carried RCB this season. They can't even complain if they get knocked out because you can't expect to win the IPL with a team construct like this.",22
"Finally with Sams in, Rabada is exclusive to the death overs",5
"DC's depth in both departments is scary at

On the other hand we are having like 5 bits and pieces players",7
Did that sextillion bot got banned or smth?,3
Everyone telling win big. Like RR didn't try yesterday. Win small DC or RCB.,9
"i know the script 

""lets get to 200""

oh crap lets get to 180 atleast

hit out or get out ffs

160?

140? wtf no way we defending that!

128 is too low",43
"Here we go bois, time for our FINAL LOSS OF THIS SEASON 

YYEEEEET",5
"If it's a low scoring game ,their will be high chance  one of teams will definitely be out of tournament (only if srh wins last one).",3
Here we go bois. Our last choke of 2020,13
"Good news is one of these two teams is going to end their losing streak.

They can't both lose.",5
I was hoping for Dube vs Dubey. Now we'll never know which spelling is better.,7
I love how Delhi fans and Rcb fans have lost all hope,20
This is giving me the “final before the final” kind of feeling.,3
Let this be either a very high scoring (>220) or a very low scoring (<120) match. Nothing in between please!!,1
"As a MI fan, I hope DC wins today; I think they're easier to beat.

I'd much rather face DC's inept batting than RCB's inept bowling in the playoffs.",0
Is saini out due to his injury ?,3
"*Do you think we will see Stoinis bowl at all?*

Are you doubting the incompetence of Iyer captaincy? Of course, he will bowl!",5
"Man I wished it rained, would have saved me from all this stress",9
"Well, it's almost time... I'm scared. 

Good luck to all the RCB fans out there.  You guys are awesome. Just needed to say that before the game in case it gets heated later.

If Delhi manages to pull a Delhi and get themselves knocked out today (pending tomorrow's result), I really hope RCB will go on to win this year.

I'd love to see one of our fan bases finally get to experience some joy next Tuesday <3",20
[deleted],7
"Have to say, Virat is a good speaker.",6
The team who will choke less will win and i think that will be Rcb because kohli's team often get knocked out after reaching the top 4.,2
[removed],12
This thread has the least amount of hope and faith amongst all the match threads so far and who can blame us,8
Saini is not a massive loss.  He's taken 6 wickets at an econ of 8.3.,6
"Is today the ""why is pant not in Indian team"" kinda day finally?",8
I remember the last time we had to beat dc in a must win game which would put us in the top 2 spot,2
"Once again they don't play Moeen, smh!",4
"Please make this match close one , I don't want to face KKR in Play -offs ( if we win last one)🤞.",3
"DC fans : Here we go bois, time for our FINAL LOSS OF THIS SEASON 
RCB fans : Here we go bois. Our last choke of 2020. 
 The state of this thread is gonna be like this all night.",1
Lets go dont let me down RCB 🥺❤️,6
Well probably gonna support RCB as they got a slight edge with their NRR,3
I want to see the fume tomorrow when Mumbai played a weakened team with Rohit being back. There will be multiple levels of anger.,2
I predict this game will go to the super over. Both teams will try their best to out-choke the other.,1
"Not sure why I'm so excited for this match?

Seems like the journey of both this teams is like a car crash, you know it'll end bad but can't take your eyes off.",4
"Virtual Knockout, two saffers in each XI... hmmm",4
"DC opt not to play Hetmyer, interesting",3
"Best player for our team hasnt even played for us, not even in UAE. By pulling out he has given us one of those rare genuine fast bowlers. Hopefully we get Woakes and Nortje both for the next season. Best situation",2
Being an RCB supporter is the fucking worst.,15
RCB top 4 are too OP,3
Why doesn't Delhi open with Pant?,3
Delhi will lose their wickets in a flurry to the spinners,2
RCB have Morris and chahal.,1
Delhi are the better side on paper. The bowling attack is much better.,3
Man this is the most depressing cricket match thread ever I swear,9
"Unless Siraj bowls a miracle spell, RCB opening bowling attack looks weak. But then DC has Rahane at top! Won't give them a good start.",3
"Atleast one of us chokers will get some joy today, I am happy with it.",3
"This whole match will be like..

RCB - you win,

DC- no, you.",9
Fuck... Release AB De Villiers and Kohli... Please we want a partnership,6
I prefer Hetmyer over Stoinis if one has to be picked.,2
WHY CANT RCB EVER WIN THE TOSS ?,5
RABADA VS ABD!!!,3
"Honestly, I want both DC and RCB to make it to the finals. DC fans know the pain of supporting a team that disappoints you season after season. They know the pain of supporting a meme team. I wish all the DC fans the best of luck. I hope we both somehow make it to the playoffs.",7
Im tired of Thala Iyer and Thala Pant,4
Would love a vintage 2016 Kohli today,3
Oh sweet lord baby Jesus have mercy on both the teams!!!!!!!!!!!!,6
Rabada and Nortje really need to show up today. They're DC's only saving grace,5
Sextillion 7th Power,3
"Just in: Pant had a long chat with SKY, might see some intense staring later tonight",4
FML I seem to be finding lesser and worse streams each day for the games.,2
Having Rahane there will atleast stabilize the chase so the net run rate doesn't take a beating.,5
Lets hope for a cracker of a match tonight,3
I have a feeling Delhi will send Sams as a floater,5
Damn both teams are really going all out today!!,2
What is this toss curse we have going on for us :(,2
DON'T WORRY RCB DON'T WORRY YOU'RE FACING USSSSS USSSSSSS,1
"If both the teams try to lose, they both end up qualifying!! Big brain",3
[Thank you RCB for going with the lineup I suggested. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jmez5s/daily_general_discussion_and_match_links_thread/gauvx80/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3),0
Here we go bois!!!! RCB I DO NOT BELIEVE IN YOU. BUT LETS DO THIS !!!,4
The only player in RCB I can always depend on doing something consistently is Yuzi,6
"RELIANCE stocks crashed today. Can expect MI to give an avg performance tomorrow. SRH win. So, today needs to be a close contest for both the teams to qualify.",3
DC batting is pretty good for chasing down 127 💦💦,2
Let's hope we get pretty intense game instead of one-sided game,1
SPARK! LOL murali! So unoriginal.,2
There's no way rcb wins this,2
Who has Rahane replaced?,4
Why is DC's best batsman Deshpande not playing ? SMH.,3
Almost 1k comments before the match starts. I think that's a first in a long time?,4

DC have changed their team AGAIN wth?!,1
"I can already imagine the thread during the second innings of the game.

DC batsman hits a six.

RCB fans - ""And there's the game""

RCB bowler takes a wicket.

DC fans - ""And there's the game""",66
mature 24(29) coming up from Pant,1
"Thank Holy Fuck Gurkeerat is out of that side, I still haven't come to terms with what he was doing in those final overs.",3
Ajinkya rahane was one of the best players form RR. I hope he drivers it today. Will be sad if this is his last match.,1
Let's hope they really go for it instead of playing safe.,2
Rcb bowling looks weak tbh,4
"Who goes where.....

WINNER assure of 2nd spot.

For LOSING team to qualify:

RCB should loose with less than 12 balls remaining
DC  should lose by less than 17 runs

(thanks Dugout)",3
Come on guys! Let’s both team play well and give our best.,2
"I think 170 will be the perfect score for RCB. 

No need to take unnecessary risks in the beginning and risk getting bowled out for cheap. 

DD will likely not chase it under 17 overs.",4

"Philippe - 1 run

_DC fans - and that's the game_",24

lets just agree on going to a super over,14
match is for 2nd spot but they have played like no 1 team,6
Now this is a very small thing but that fielding really helps with the whole momentum and overall feel. Excellent work by Nortje,6
Good fkin fielding,5

Every ball bowled is a threat to my life,3
u/zambur-e-bahar please dont reverse jinx today man :(,1

Since Kholi is concerned about the weak rcb middle order getting exposed why not send Shivam dube at 3 and use him as how kkr use sunil Narine... If it works then it will be huge win.. If does not VK can still play that anchor role.. Becuase playing at 6rpo till 16 over and then getting out doesn't help Shivam dube as well,3

[deleted],4
And the end mumbai is gonna take the trophy home,4
Definitely 20 runs short!,2
Sams is so much like Nannes it is unnerving,1
DC most likely replaced Heytmyre with Jinx to allo Iyer and pant to play freely. Interesting choice. Only issue is who will play where.,1
Looks like a shit pitch,1
phillipe instead of finch ...good choice?,2
"D Sams I'll drink your bathwater, pls take a hattrick",8
The real high-stake question is: will Mr Nags continue even if RCB doesn't.,13
Can kkr qualify if srh wins tomorrow?,0
I like this playing XI,2
Wait on,1
"With not much depth in batting today, should DC promote Axar for a Narine like cameo??",2
They're too scared to loft. Clear the 30 yard circle and it's a boundary,18
CMON PHILLIPPE BOI.,4
Philippe should learn more about taking singles. Its just been boundaries with little to no running.,5
"IPL final needs some tradition for new, funny commercials like Super Bowl",7
Fuck. Cant find the gaps.,21
Who is sams?,0
Pitch looks belter tbh,4
Phillipe is trying hard,4
How can someone hold their two best bowlers ?,6
"Pitch it a bit further up, make the Batsman drive",6
"""Dead last in scoring between overs 7-15"" then the camera turns to Kohli lol",11
What's Iyer's natural game? Tuk tuk?,2
Padikkal is runaway winner of that emerging player award isn't he?,73
Please ABD teach these lads to hit over the top,9
DC's playing XI looks quite balanced on paper,10
By 2030 we'll have 11 clones of Smith playing for Australia.,13
five words - pressure game and virat kohli,5
steven smith lite,4
"Too slow from powerplay standards, like I understand being cautious but at least score at 7-8 an over man",5
[deleted],5
Given that Philippe is groomed in the RCB camp I was hoping he would run hard between the wickets. That's one thing that's lacking in his game. Too many dot balls.,5
News from other side is Watson has retired from all forms of cricket,5
Are we playing test here. God damn it. Get on with it already.,1
How come no gap man,2
Excellent by Sams,3
Don't waste the powerplay ffs,7
"3 foreign bowlers, even MI doesn't do that",7
"Yes, let's waste the powerplay playing sensibly. Then we'll also play the middle overs sensibly and then in the final 4, we'll get out after settling ourselves in, playing run a ball and leave ABD to get going from ball 1 and expect him to make a 50 off 9 balls, amirite?",20
Looking pretty bad for KKR right now.,2
"I think we all have a mutual feeling, Virat will go bonkers.",6
RCB playing perfectly to score 160 and secure their playoff berth.,2
Sams has already done better than Deshpande and Harshal. Don't think Rahane will do worse than Hetmyer's usual 8(5) either,2
Why do we suck at PowerPlay some much?,4
Why the fuck is this Josh ad coming after EVERY over,2
This might be Delhi’s best squad yet,2
Josh seems to have limited off side shots,3
"I told you guys, KFC > Philippe",0
RCB being cautious scares me cuz ABD and Kohli might go berserk,3
"DC top order with a combine mix of indian test specialist, future Indian captain, Indian loi veteran, Indian future top order batsman and an explosive finisher...
It's like Delhi wrote all the names of indian batsman on a piece of paper and bought whi ever picked",6
"Didn’t anyone watch Stokes yesterday. Despite getting out early, his plan was simple. Loft the ball and clear the 30 yard fielders",3
Looks like openers have been instructed to keep it on the ground,2
Why are our openers so scared to loft or take advantage of the powerplay?,1
That DJ murdered Nortje's name,2
fielding lookin tight tight tight,2
16/0 >>5/3,2
Nokia bhaiya pls 155kmph yorker.,3
So far so good,1
"I don't mind this, they should not lose a wicket in pp",2
How is an over with a boundary (AND an extra) called tidy?,1
"Really feeling bad for Syska.

RIP Irfan Khan.",3
How will rcb score against three quality fast bowlers,2
cmon nokia bowl 6 160kph missiles. How hard would it be,6
"Not a bad strategy, load the bowling up and restrict RCB to an attainable total. Our weak ass batting lineup crumbles if we have to chase anything over 160ish",4
Good fkin bowling mane,3
inb4 Swann comes in wearing Sextillion7thPower,6
Binga just cracked an epic dad joke,3
Binga with the worst knock knock joke ever,2
Brett Lee with the worst joke of the IPL,1
Nice shot padiii,1
I don't mind RCB playing sensibly. We have lost the last couple of games by losing wickets too soon.,2
Fetch that bitch,3
Lezzzooo,1
SHOT !!!,3
No timing whatsoever. Finch playing in Philippe's get-up,3
With dew playing 3 spinners seems foolish,3
Mystery solved -rabada is playing as a batsmen,3
INTENT,4
That Josh app ad is considered talent now?,6
4d plan by koach to not win by 20 runs because they dont wanna face russell in playoffs,3
Can Shahbaz hit,1
Josh could've easily been on 25 rn if he could pierce that field.,7
"DC until yesterday : Shaw or Rahane (*scratching heads*)

Today : Shaw and Rahane",7
"AB hits rabada for 28 an over today , i can feel it...",8
ah nortje bowling slower ones at 145,8
Knock knock joke in the Dugout,8
I have no hope in DC now.,4
"The DC batting is weak

DC: Let’s drop Hetmyer and weaken it further",5
Sundar ahead in the Emerging POTY poll is he still emerging?,3
Lol even Viral Kilo amazed by DDP. Subscribe.,10
Most Indian cricketers are growing beard trying to look like captain Kohli to get it the team but this mad lad Shaw can't grow a beard so he is getting high on cough syrups to look like Ravi Shastri.,13
DC management is strange lately. Too much chopping and changing. Batting lineups. To shaw or not to shaw. Rahane doesn't seem like a player who'll play a big role in the chase. He's a guy who can ensure they don't get all out though.,3
Knock knock Nortje,2
power play is for scroing runs as fielders are up ...go ariel not hit straight to them,6
Delhi really need to invest in a lower order hitter before the next ipl. Rahane is not going to cut it.,5
Knock knock,3
kohli khada hua,5
Knock-eah,3
[deleted],5
Don't hit nortje,1
DC can't chase anything above 150 with this batting lineup. Trying to shore up bowling when your team folded for 110 wtf Punter.,3
"Boom boom Bumrah

Knock Knock Nortje",9
Bowling mane,2
Knock knock,2
Rabada overs kept for Kohli I guess.,3
Can finch be the next big aus opener for csk ?,3
Competition for top order spots in the Indian team will be too much in the coming years. So many talented top order batsmen.,5
"Every year I think the IPL ads can't be cringier. 

Every year we fall deeper into misery.",6
My Heart is too weak for this,7
Looks like Gill has competition with Padikkal and Gaikwad as the backup white ball opener. And all 3 have solid domestic stats so it’s not based on IPL alone.,8
"Ok guys, what'll be the ideal match progression for KKR's survival?",6
Why is PaPa not playing? Injured? He wasn't bad in the powerplay.,2
Let’s go RCB,6
Fetch it once more.,2
Its 4,2
This might be my last comment in this thread. I might die before 10th over.,6
"Looks like both teams will go for a low-ish scoring match, and take it DEEP in both innings

As a KKR fan, it was all a dream...",5
"Confused b/w which team to support. Both their fans have suffered so much.

Hope the winner today makes it count and grabs the title!",5
DDP is a great find for RCB,3
isnt shahbaz an allrounder? why did they show him as a bowler in that graphic?,3
Please be 4,8
Ez 4,6
Gw man,1
Took a bit but Paddikal figured out you can hit lofted shots against these balls safely enough,19
Fingers touched,1
Lee and Lara's cricket comedy special upcoming,2
Remember when Kohli had a good record against bumrah and rabada,5
What knock knock joke are you guys talking about,2
Think that's a boundary,1
That's 4 cmon,2
Dugout commentators are high.,0
"I chuckle everytime Danny Morrison says Bish...""that's right Bish""...  
  
Yes I'm 6 years old",7
">love the fast bowlers they give their bodies up

Laughs in Bumrah",5
"This is stupid bowling imo

The legside boundary is huge, come around the wicket and let him hit through the legside

Don't bowl over the wicket, angle it across him and give him width to attack the offside",3
That’s 4,2
"Outfield looks slow, will speed up in the second innings though with the dew",3
wake me up when delhi take a wicket,1
Alright bois pack up,5
I don't think that's a 4,2
"Rabada the specialist fielder, bowler and batsman",1
Give it 4. Make up for the short run,5
Clearly a boundary,9
Abd fans here ?,5
Looks 4,6
Is it 4 or is it not?,1
I think the third umpire just wants to look at Rabada's ass,9
NOT A 4,6
"Looks like a four to me but I won't hold it against the ump if it's not given, quite close",3
"DC could have brought Keemo Paul imo, good variations decent slogger gun fielder",2
Fuck this shit,5
"That's a 4, what the fuck.",8
WTF,5
Lmao if that 1 run comes back,7
Lol that wasn't a 4?,6
"That 1 run is make or break, brilliant Rabada luv ya",2
Fuck. That's 4.,7
Sextillion7thpower^TM Super Striker of the Match,3
"Dc and rcb the only teams with 2 south Africans in thier XI this season, also the teams to choke the most...coincidence, I think not",6
At least Rabada is smiling,5
Aww cmon it was touching his finger,4
Josh ffs,2
Kohli got some material to fume over,5
"As always, it would have to be individual brilliance from some batsman for RCB. That has always been the case. Kohli, ABD  Or Padikkal?",3
Smith lite struggling,2
Rabada!? More like norunbada. Am I rite fellas?,5
Dafuq 3rd umpire,6
GOOD FKIN FIELDING,3
Nokia Yaar Yorker @ 156kmph,4
Umpiring is a fucking joke this season,7
Third umpire blind confirmed,8
FUCK OFF,3
"Lol that was clearly a 4, we are talking about Margins here to get disqualifed.",6
arghhh delhi take a wicket yallll need it,2
RABADA expression: aaj mai karke aaya,4
That will feature in the post match interview for sure,4
Rabada's expression after the save also said it was a 4!! Shitty umpiring continues.,7
Junior Smudgy has to go big now,6
"Wait, that was definitely a four",5
Rabada's smile is so wholesome,9
"Not about this match 
But what is the exact situation with Rohit?",2
Tuk tuk academy,-2
That’s a 4 all day. WHO IS THE BLIND FUCK BEHIND THE CAMERA,6
I P L   U M P I R I N G,4
We gotta look for run out chances,2
Josh is struggling,3
Ian Chappell: The umpire must be from Rabada's village.,6
"Philippe looks like Smith, hits at rahuls pace, gets runs like Shaw",9
When Philippe bats why does it feel like there are 20 fielders?,13
"Padikkal showed us, loft in the powerplay, there's no one there to catch it",5
Scenes if RCB loses by 1 run,8
RCB gonna be eliminated by 1 run lmao,7
Didn't RCB losing streak start when they took Phillipe in the team?,3
Scenes if DC lose by 19 runs and qualify on NRR and this boundary or not decision gets brought up.,9
"On-field umpires : Not a no ball above shoulders 

Third umpires : Not conclusive, I'll go with whatever the fuck I want 

Can't really say who's sober anymore",4
"that's not just a run saved, that's probably boundary saved given it kept devdutt off strike",2
I think Punter knows insider details on how to stop Philippe.,5
Imagine we get to see these two meme teams again in the 2nd qualifier. Oh the joy. /s,7
May this one denied run haunt RCB as much as it did KXIP,7
Thank god we came to our senses and dropped Deshpande. After the decent first game he has been shocking. We had no business sticking with him for as long as we did.,3
12(17) fuck off,5
SHIT,1
Nice batting philipe,2
Shaw takes a catch.. wow.. we may actually win this!,5
*Laughs in Finch*,2
Noooooo Bumrah,3
Noice rabada,3
Philippe. Fucking hell.,5
Kohli looked super ready to come!,3
Play 17 balls for this shit,4
KAGISO RABADA YOU DAA MAAANNN!!!,5
Kohllapse begins lads,11
NOOO,4
Please don't hold back tonight kohli,5
Need me a Koach special,6
Get rekt Josh go make some stupid tongue twisters on your app,5
"Idiot Philippe, you had to protect Koach from Rabada",4
Bc Prithvi shaw ne catch karli? Wtf.,3
Rabada takes his first powerplay wicket against us smh,6
Fucking Yes cmon bois,2
I'm so fucking happy,3
Rabada taking powerplay wickets now? league FuCked,6
"13 in 17, yeah cool",4
Smith's shit form in IPL continues,12
RaBaDa CaNt TaKe WiCkEts In PoWeRpLaY,5
"O look at that! If you bring a strike bowler, you get a wicket. Who knew?",4
And so it begins,2
Philippe a little too early for prime time.,4
Fuck it. Inb4 a collapse,2
Shaw took a catch. Its already a win!!,5
SHAW???!!! SHAWWW???!!!!!,2
What the fuck was that shot Philipe. A defence into the sky?,3
Playing Rahane in the middle order is imho a good move to allow the hitters at the top the flexibility to attack.,5
Very suprised that Shaw caught that .,3
Philippe batting just shows how hard it is to score at fast rate at this standard even though you try to be aggressive,2
I think RCB made mistake by not backing Finch,2
Philippe paying tribute to Finch with this innings..,6
"**4.1** Rabada to Philippe, OUT, **Shaw tracks back at cover and takes a simple catch.** **25-1**

JR Philippe c Shaw b Rabada 12 (17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70.58",3
Rabada be like Lol Philipee who,3
Koach is walking out on a mission,3
~~Kagiso Rabada has not taken a wicket in the PP~~,6
Why ?,2
"When Prithvi Shaw also starts taking catches, you have to wonder, is it finally DC's day??",5
Raabada back in business,4
Kohllapse incoming?,2
Parthiv would have easily cleared 30yard circle in PPs.. Should have been given an opportunity...,4
Finch would have been better,3
Ashes 25/5?,1
Rabada is not wicket less. Is dc win coming?,2
Guy doesn't have a 110 SR for no reason,3
Had my heart in mouth after seeing Shaw under the ball.,4
Tuk tuk time,2
This guy fucked us. Fucking hell Philippe,0
Let's goooooo,2
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jmm9u8/match_thread_55th_match_delhi_capitals_v_royal/gawa8z2?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

"Kohli please hit,no more tuktuk please",2
Rabada is back,3
This Bingo guy looks like SKY,2
"Philippe has potential, but needs some work on his game in general",5
Threw his wicket away ....decent delivery nothing special,6
Who keeps trying to hit Scott Styris with a ball? 😭,2
josh removes his mask to reveal it was finch all along,10
Kholi will get out for less than 10 today. Just feel it won't be his day.,4
LET'S GO RABADAAAAAAAAAAAAA,3
pulple cap back bitches,5
DC peaking again!?,3
The wicket draught ends ... Is it raining in Africa?,3
Wow Shaw didn't drop that,5
Kohlapse on the cards.,4
Ultra Instinct Rabada,1
12(17) < 0(1),2
Kohli is your time to shine. SHOW THE WORLD WHY YOU ARE THE BEST BATSMEN IN THE WORLD.,10
How big of a margin one of the team has to lose to be below KKR?,3
Is this Josh's final innings in the IPL for sometime? I don't think he'll play if RCB qualify and might not get sold next year.,2
"Rabada being rabaada 

just rabada things",2
RCB always helpful for others to create records. First wicket for Rabada in PP,2
If that was given 4 paddikal wouldve been on strike,4
We're fucked tbh,8
Is the first time a team have decided to play with 3 foreign fast bowlers?,2
"Phillipe will be released by RCB to be picked by some other team in the next auction. He will then go on to score 500 runs in 2021 IPL. 

THIS IS THE WAY OF RCB.",23
Good guys RCB gave a wicket to Rabada. Now expect Shaw to hit a blistering 70+ at the top.,6
I’m scared Koach will get out to Rabada,7
Kohli 15(18) to be dismissed,5
One side seems to have read the pitch horribly wrong. DC has 3 pacers and RCB have 3 spinners,8
I actually wouldn't mind Kohli going tuk tuk for now,6
Alright this is definitely collapse,1
Probably should’ve played Finch as experience matters in must win games.,6
Rajasthan may have ended up with the wooden spoon but my boy KG Rabada took a wicket and I’m happy. Please don’t fuck this DC I’m rooting for you sweeties,4
Shaw almost let that go through,9
"The incompetence of Josh Phillippe should be the final nail in the coffin for Mike "" Dugout"" Hesson.",5
please just go past 49,6
"Shaw taking catches, I am in tears",8
Kohli 100 incoming,4
"We have had a lot of one sided matches this last week. 

Hope today is not another one.",4
Shaw is taking catches now?,6
It's time for a 👑 innings,2
Shot boi,1
Holy fuck padikkal. Better than koach lol.,1
"I don't know what's more surprising, kg picking a wicket in the pp or shaw taking a catch",2
Lara oozes sophistication 🙌🏼,2
These Padikkal pickup shots are a delight to watch.,5
An MI vs RCB qualifier with Koach screwing and SKY hitting a hundred! DREAM!!!!,-3
Kohli gonna play like the best player in the world. Today is the day he proves himself,2
Padikal shots were adorable af. Especially towards off side.,3
"This has all the signs of being a collapse. Below 6 RR. Below 30 runs. Yes, collapse.",2
Would Finch have been better than Josh? Probably not,9
"Padikkal looking to takeover this game, nice.",8
You usually have your secomd best fielder at cover. DC have Shaw there -_-,9
RCB will score between 150-160 and then DC comes to bat and suddenly pitch becomes flat as a road.,7
I predict Koach 30+ today.,2
Mentor and Trainee batting now?,5
Rabada smiling>>>,7
"Okay quick question, all the playoff probabilities are keeping in mind the first batting team scores 160. What if RCB gets bundled out for 130 and DC chases it in say, 16 overs?",4
DevD and Joshua playing on different wickets,5
Under Pressure Kohli needs to fire today. Even a nice and composed 48(43) will do against this DC batting lineup.,6
This is still extremely scary. DDP makes me afraid,5
"Not sure who is worse

DC at chasing or RCB at setting targets",9
"Padikkal touches the ball. Commentators : Yuvraj Singh, Yuvraj Singh",8
Lol watch bowlers leak those 30 runs in the first 2 overs of powerplay.,2
Will take 20 overs of tuk-tuk rather than a collapse please. I watched Gurkeerat last match in Spain but the s is silent.,7
rabada take koachhh go for it,2
In before Kohli 12(17),5
Man Philippe crunched some good ass cover drives but everything went to them fielders,2
It was the first time he was behind in the purple cap race so that made him take the impossible powerplay wicket.,3
"Played almost half the powerplay, hits most of them to the fielder. Gets out. Fuck you Philippe",4
"Padikkal and Bishnoi have been exceptional in this IPL. 

Both the teams deserve credit for fast tracking them.",10
Phillipe sucks on the off side big time,2
Shaw is a specialist fielder now. We made too many jokes about his fielding so he quit batting practice to focus only on fielding.,9
Pls get to like 180,8
Big brain move by Padikkal. Lofting is safe in powerplay as long as he times them,3
National team call up when,6
Why is virat always so over enthusiastic?,0
Kohlapse time. Kohli 9 (7) incoming with 4 2's and 1 single.,-1
Why tf don't they have a deep cover vs Padikkal?,3
"prithvi takes a catch, first step in the redemption arc",5
Good field placement,1
"All these young Indian batsmen ,Gaikwad, padikkal play the lofted cover drives well",5
Rcb history says Aussie players have been below par for them. Strac is an exception.,8
Cmon lads show some intent,4
Got the wrong guy out,8
"Did he say ""some people watch porn""?",6
Normal commentary is unbearable once you get used to Dugout,11
Padikal looks really good today,1
Inb4 rabada gets Kohli again,1
"With our luck, one of abd or kohli will fuck us up today. And more so some nobody hitter (relatively) like Dube will hit a 32(12)",2
"I just want Koach to score today, fuck playoffs",9
Every left hander is Yuvi in T20s and Ganguly in tests.,6
Kohli 100 strike rate is a big win in my book,5
Inb4 Kohli runs and tires out DDP,5
Rabada finally got a wicket,2
Please rcb bat properly and don't make your bowlers do all the work. There has been shit batting for the past 3 losses,7
Don't know when they'll realize that we won't win matches by wasting every fucking powerplay.,7
"I'm always scared with RCB.

Get a wicket? In walks Kolhi.
Get another? In walks ABD. 

No respite. Still more batting to come.",9
I want the international Kohi today who dominates Rabada not the ipl donkey,7
Of the 20 year old uncapped players that are playing this season IPL.. Devdutt looks the most matured batsman..,14
Kohli has been a bit quiet this IPL. I'm scared he's gonna blast for 80 runs today in like 40 odd balls,3
"What are the odds that there will be another ""we were short by 20 runs"" interview by Koch today",1
Burj Khalifa!!!,0
"Yeah, go and drop Parthiv more. Just your second/third best Indian batsman, one of your best 4 batsmen in the team as a whole, has played key roles for previous tournament winning teams, and has been a great domestic captain who won multiple trophies with underdog teams. 

Who needs him, with the flexibility that would provide in getting an additional middle/lower middle order foreign all rounder as well.",6
Kohli loves a 50 against Delhi....,2
Kohli out hoga aur phir chutiya jaisi shakal bna k baith jayege jkr abhi next 2over me..,-1
In b4 Isuru Udana 50(22),9
"Kohli is the silent accumulator isn't he? 
431 runs this edition without much noise and buzz",13
Pls get paddikal out,1
"Enough of this super v nonsense, am I watching Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on Disney?",9
What’s the par score?,3
"I want both these teams to play the finals.
If not, then the winner of today's match to lift the 2020 IPL cup.",6
"I’ve been the biggest proponent of dropping Finch earlier and giving Philippe 4-5 more matches, but considering this is a knockout, maybe Finch’s experience was needed here",2
Young Indian batsman confident against quality 90mph+ bowling is a breath of fresh air.,7
DDP won't be getting out... so better for DC to keep Kohli busy in singles till the 15-16 over. Helps prevent ABD onslaught,11
Two more wickets within 5 overs and it's DC's game surely,6
"Phillippe didn't fuck RCB, Kohli, Hesson and Katich have. 

Even RR, for how garbage they were, gave Stokes and Uthappa a run up top and stuck to them.

13 matches in, RCB have no clue who should open with Paddikal. 

Philippe was randomly played in the middle order for the first two matches, then he was drafted in as an opener in the 12th match. He did well, scored two 30s. He was bound to have a bad game. 

Maybe this wouldn't have happened had they dropped Finch after 8 games and given Phillipe 6 matches as an opener.",10
Sams is seriously underused IMO,2
Why tf is there a song about a skyscraper,5
"Bangalore more dependent on Virat Kohli than Delhi on Shreyas Iyer - Virender Sehwag

W00t?!",9
The only favorite cricketer I ever had was Rahul Dravid. No one else really impressed me since. I don't know why but these young players Gill and Padikkal have really impressed me with their beautiful shots. Are they really that good?,5
Today is AB's day. Ready to 💉it,2
Kohli too cautious...,1
I'm more worried about padikkal than kohli,2
Kohli will run like bolt today. He will convert 0s into 1s and 1s into 2s. 2s in 3s. But DC will score more 4s and 6s and win it anyway.,7
Need Kohli's Hyderabad innings against WI from last year,4
Bc 25 fielders hain dc ke,9
"Run rate is gonna be 6 for the next 5 overs, if there is no wicket. If there is a wicket, well go at 11 rpo and lose AB in 2 overs",6
4 this ball then?,2
"All I want is a 49 all out, bas itna sa khwab hai",1
Fielding has been infinitely better this game than our entire season,5
Burj Khalifa song 😳,1
Ban star plus please,3
Ah yes,2
Yeahhhhh boiii,1
That's good for a powerplay bowling,3
that's a tough catch by prithvi's standard,6
Kohli and dot balls means wicket,3
OMG IM FAPPING TO THAT SHOT,7
"Watch. Got his cover drive in, now he'll get out",4
Class,4
Finally....chill out buddy. Play ur game pls,5
That's the cover drive we are waiting for. ROAR,5
SHOT,4
Beautiful!,4
Finally,4
Classic KOACH shot,7
Time to show his class,5
"Nooo virat you're non supposed to hit boundaries, please rotate the strike",4
Kohli's perfect start... for a test match.,4
In before Padikkal gets tired while running for 2s with Koach at the other end.,5
Yep my guy's all riled up,7
Wow. Harsha was spoton on that cover drive from kohli in the first 4-5 balls.,11
Man Kohli is out of form and is still the 6th top run scorer of this IPL. That's mental,12
"Why don't RCB play Parthiv at the top? He can't do much worse than what Finch and Philippe have done, but that allows RCB to beef up their middle order and bowling with Moeen Ali.",5
Bro this RCB Anthem playing in the background is lit,4
"Pray to the Gods that Kohli doesn't find form today.

When in song, five Rabadas couldn't stop him.",5
That over confidence kohli there.. not good.,-1
Ponting: *we are screwed*,4
"Damn boi, we have lots of openers. Padikkal, Shaw, Gill, Mayank, KL. I can see Gill & Padikkal doing good in middle-order, and KL has done it already. Mayank is explosive as an opener, so gotta play him.",7
Ok how are we doing,1
"Dear Harsha, from when is backfoot punch through covers is called as cover drive??",14
Kohli is back baby.,3
Are captains supposed to hand over the teams to the match referee/umpires before the toss? I was thinking if they could change the composition based on the toss turnout..,3
How will we chase anything above 140,7
I want AB and Kohli to fire in the same match just like the old days once again.. Please annihilate DC today ..,14
DAMN. Kohli's cover drive.. looks in touch.. either out in next few balls or he scores big,14
What a shot padi,3
Good signs from Kohli.,3
Here is a brilliant idea : Pant to rile up Kohli from behind the stumps,7
SHOT BOI,6
"akshay kumar : dilaadu tujhe burj khalifa

shaikhs from dubai : ha saale khajur aur kuch?",6
What a shot that,1
Kohli has never struggled this bad in finding the gaps since 2012. Hope he changes that today.,2
[deleted],-6
Iyer still don't know how to place field.,2
Will any RCB batsman end up with a strike rate higher than 125 today?,2
This was even better!,3
C'mon I wanna see Ash mankad Koach. Then 2020 will have redeemed itself.,10
"Devdutt ""Elegant"" Paddikal",2
"Kohli * exists *

Bhogle: 💦 💦",12
Kohli needs to stop showing so much intent and play tuktuk please.,2
Paddikal you beauty,2
Fuck yaar wanted to see Bumrah wearing the purple cap.:(,2
So the losing team is out?,3
This guy is the future,5
Nokia BC saale Yaar :(,3
Padi smooth af,3
"This year 

Rahul 670 runs - 129 Strike Rate

DDP 439 runs - 127 Strike Rate

Kohli 432 runs - 122 Strike Rate

Please remind why has r/cricket only been memeing KL for his SR",22
This is why I love Kohli. When he's at the crease there are no easy singles. You gotta run hard and be ready for a two.,6
Lol 40-1 ain't a bad start. Idk why the commentators are shitting on them.,7
Nortje has the best comeback deliveries honestly,6
"RCB and South Africa are the same, in that they don't give their best batsman enough time at the crease.",6
That's the Kohli we know and we want.,3
Pant has been quieter recently hasn't he?,3
"Frankly, RCB's safety net is 160. I think they'll get there and secure the playoff spot.",3
Not bad for powerplay bowling.,2
Ah.. I want to cheer DDP all the time.. please play for India soon,11
[deleted],4
"No 3rd man for a guy who balls at 145+

Iyer...... Why???😭",11
"pls go 263/5 

havent seen such porn since 248/3 in 2016. will gladly fail nnn to see it",4
"So

If this match is close, both of these go through to playoffs, yeah?",5
Pretty bad powerplay regardless. Inevitably putting too pressure on a very fragile middle order..,2
Can someone tell me why some people dislike Harsha Bhogle?,1
"Lol. As much as I like Punter as a player, I don't need to see his face after every ball.",3
Padikkal is Yuvraj singh Lite.. plays similar shots with similar foot movement but has half his stamina,0
"GG. Nortje is getting smacked.

Let's just hope DC get close so they don't get kicked out.",4
Mah man Parthiv did not get to play a game this season.,4
"Since I too am a donkey, can someone provide stats of Virat vs Rabada in t20i?",1
"Power play is over koach be like "" all fielders outside the circle can  take my singles now.""",16
Paddikal plays in such a mature manner for his age especially compared to the other youngsters in the tournament.,14
Inb4 ethical mankads the unethical dude who doesn't select players for aus tour,14
Ponting looks like he’s ready to stab someone,7
Kohli gonna make me break NNN,3
I'm afraid of both batsmen on crease,3
"If Ashwin mankads Koach, I will gild every comment on this match thread.",4
Koach coming in during the PP helps him so much,1
Pointing feeling the emotions of the opposition fans that his Aussie team used to  thrash during his time in the DC dugout.. Must be a unknown emotion for him...,5
Par score?,0
If ashwin mankads koach in this match he will stick his bat in his ash. Lol sorry.,6
Who is Koach have seen his name so many times today?,2
Get fucked ethics.,1
Imo Finch >>> Philippe,7
Kohli is playing like he's chasing a certain score to ensure DC doesn't get there in 17 overs.,2
I remember a highly upvoted comment saying Kohli's poor form coincided with him turning vegan. Is this a joke or does this actually have any credence lol,9
What a shot!,3
So RCB are scoring around 165 I guess. DC will chase it down in 18th or 19th over. Typical boring match with death over choke,-1
Yes BOI!!!,1
Perfectly placed,2
ASH vs KOHLI!!!!,1
12 runs already and still no wide third man. Ffs,2
Does paddikal need to fix his cement feet?? Or is he just fine as he is playing currently??,5
Damn DDP. Not an easy shot vs the worlds best off spinner!!,1
It’s an ok start. They can build on this.,2
I fucking love padikkal,3
inb4 padikkal 85 (45),2
Mankade incoming,3
Commentators seem biased tbh,1
Padikks is so good damn,3
In how many overs should DC complete their chase if they are to overtake RCB's NRR?,1
"Padikkal, you suave bastard",3
FINALLY they are finding the gaps and the runs are coming.,5
Padikkal is a different batsmen when his batting in the 1st innings.,3
Pant back to chirping,2
VK vs Kohli. I'm terrified,2
My heart just skipped a beat,1
My last wish from this IPL is to see Ashwin get spanked one more time. Please do it RCB.,6
"DC supporters let's be honest.

We aren't expecting DC to win right? We know that right?",3
Easy easy easy,1
Harsha can run one of those ASMR channels on youtube,4
Just had a panic attack,3
Tbh I used to like pre-captain Kohli than the current one who is stuck between good PR and a pure knob,1
Don't worry lads it's halal to nut to cricket in NNN,5
Fun fact: Kohli was never single because he always converted the singles into doubles,14
"We get two type of ads during IPL. Mutual funds have to give disclaimer that it is subject to market risks and one should be cautious. Betting ads don't give any kind of disclaimer and lull people to false security that they will win the amount because some middle class guy got ""lucky"".",12
Kya,1
Is it because im a RCB fan.. Why does batsmen like Vijay shankar ans Rayudu looks  impossible to get out when they play against us and Virat and AB can get against a gully cricket bowler too..,7
Ethical mind please mankad Koach,8
Is Delhi sponsored by Teletubbies?  Why is there a guy in a teletubby costume behind the stumps?,16
Purple cap has again went to rabada ...i wish it could have stayed with bumrah,5
"kohli : runs a quick single.

bhogle : 💦💦💤 = **STONKS** 📉📉💰",15
Just dont lose wickets please,11
ASH won't have good bowling figures... 4 ov 40 runs,5
Who wants to see Ashwin mankad Kohli lol,14
Pls don't make ddp run 2s,16
Pitch holding up there damn,3
"Paddikal will make India debut before SKY 

And that's a fact.",11
Look how silent he is! I don't even recognise Pant anymore,9
Ball isn't coming onto the bat nicely.,2
Why are Indians so good at math? Cuz we spend our entire childhoods calculating net run rates and getting into stats battles on the internet,39
Please RCB win this match.,3
Pant keeps quiet behind stumps when Cheeku Bhaiya bats,10
They'll still somehow score 180. Definitely.,2
Which match does kkr fans worried more about? Todays or tomorrow's??,1
"I'm hoping Padikkal negates Axar, and if he goes the likes of Dubey and Sundar being promoted happens again. 

Really be needing ABD to take down Rabada-Nortje and launch Sams at the death. That's gotta be the difference maker here.",8
Cmon RCB SMACK axar,9
Darth Ethics mankding Kohli would be the cherry on top of the IPL sundae. Ashwin pls.,8
is reddit-stream loading live comments on the desktop or do we have to manually refresh the screen everytime.,1
46/1 after 7. Shit scoring. FFs why does rcb make these pitches look more deadly than they really are.,6
The way Padikkal uses the crease to convert full length balls into good length balls. Masterful.,3
"Guys listen to Radiohead watching this match, your tears will fall as nature intended",-7
abd looks tense af,7
senior rahul and padikkal going at a decent pace.,7
Don't see DC chasing in 17.3 overs. Bruh,5
No Pant chatter for Cheeku?,8
Scenes if Ashwin mankands Koach,5
Axar is a good bowler,4
ABD looks so nervous,2
"Devdutt's last name reminds me of these lines from Padayappa (Rajni movie) song

Vazhkaiyil aayiram thadaikalappa,

thadaikalum onakkoru *padikalappa*...

I don't think I can translate this effectively :D

Edit: Giving it a shot

""There are a 1000 obstacles in life, but these obstacles are a stepping stone for you...""  


Padikkal indeed means stepping stone",8
"Bangar having his Wasim ""I had a chat with him"" moment.",1
I think i am in love with Kane Williamson,2
No leg spinner today. Katich and kohli should have opened with abd.,4
Nortje hasn’t been himself since Kishan beat him to all parts,14
If RCB is gonna lose today atleast give me an ABD century please..,8
"I looked up Shami, and it says he's 30. I don't fucking buy that, anyone else feel this way?",11
"Kohli vs Rabada in T20Is

7 innings

25 runs

3 dismissals

SR : 96.15",7
"They're expecting it from Ashwin, in fact Axar should be the one going for the Mankad",6
People saying Ashwin should mankad Kohli like Kohli doesn't stay in his crease,10
"Kohli certainly has this on his mind that this is a high pressure game and chasing is not easy, so he's gonna stick to a respectable total and then get thrashed by Dhawan.",12
Kohli ABD don't have good SR against spinners.... hence ABD looks tensed.,3
Tuk tuk > kohllapse,8
"Lmao, ABD face: wasting my fucking balls.",10
"RCB at 49

Me: 👁👄👁",3
DDP and Koach just have to bat until the 14th over. AB will do the rest,4
"Somebody give abd a blanket, man's shivering",5
Kohli ffs get some boundaries. Don't tire players out,5
If he seems to look nervous them stop fuckin showing him on screen,6
"50-1, still a dream for us DC fans 😂",5
If only DC had Kane instead of iyer.,2
[deleted],2
What bowler are they planning to target? They keep playing out most of them with 6-7 run overs.,6
Who would they try to target?,1
Should Axar have been bowled in that KKR match against Narine-Rana?,2
Kohli is transitioning into a rahane now with this slow momentum killing starts,3
"I want both these teams to play the finals.
If not, then the winner of today's match to lift the 2020 IPL cup.

Possible if the win/loss margin isn't huge and SRH loses tomorrow.",7
"I watch all other teams tonk a specific bowler and cover up the lack of runs 


Then I see RCB giving respect to everyone.",9
Seems like Koach has watched last 3 matches of DC and decided 135 is enough to win against DC.,10
"downvote me all you want, Axar is discounted Jadeja.",7
"Lol RCB haven't learnt from their previous games and KXIP's approach, have they?",1
ABD shivering.... DC might quiver later when he bats..... being nervous is dangerous...,2
"Every team I’ve supported this year (csk, then kxip) have been knocked out

From now on I am supporting rcb (1/2 kannadiga)... sorry in advance my brothers",5
I swear if Kohli gets out without accelerating,10
Wow 52-1. RCB gonna get 180 here.,3
The way the camera pans to AB after each single lmao.,10
Easiest way to lose weight is to bat with Kohli and run between the wickets,6
Padikkal is no AB,1
Mankad is loading,0
I see 128-7 here,1
"So who's going to get the prized wickets of Kohli and Ab?
My bet is on Axar",2
Its only fair someone sledge Kohli today,7
Virat at the toss and AB in the dugout actually look nervous today!,2
Are we seeing another instance of kohli reading pitch bad and aiming target of 160?,0
Kohli getting ready to choke!,0
Why do they always play like it's a fucking test match.,1
Koach will tire out DDP and make him play a loose shot,2
"RCB to take it deep then choke before setting 160 to win

Dc to take it deep and then choke and lose

Both manage to qualify....

Plz someone go hard, where's the intent?😭",5
"I doubt Delhi with one less big hitter, would chase what ever RCB posts here in 17.3 overs. Let's see what happens.",1
ah yes the 6.6 RPO in middle overs is back again bois,3
ABD looks nervous because he knows the shit koach and co is doing. They're choking the Run rate harder than shami chokes his wife (/s) and then they plan on using him as the undo button,6
Man dis pitch is good for spinner..troubled sights for delhi,3
Man that's orgasmic bowling ngl,3
Playing the ad featuring a player right after they've performed badly should be made illegal to save the said player from being bombarded with abuses.,4
Kohli's strike rate and complete dependency on ABD to go berserk is what leading to RCB's low score dilemma and lost games,5
RR is a bit too low imo.,1
I have a feeling that DC and CSK (and probably Kings XI) will go hard at the auctions for Kanos if he’s released by SRH,3
Extremely expensive for an Axar over,2
Swann with the ol' reddit jokes,2
DDP starting to say no to Kohli's runs,4
Ezezeze,1
[removed],7
Pant is back. I am happy.,5
"I dont care if we lose, just want to go into playoffs ffs.",3
Padikkal into another 30,4
"Only 52 from 8 overs. 

How many RCB fans started panicking now?",10
i will.kill you koach if you keep doing this tuktuk ( angry af emoji ),-7
3 digit jersey numbers need to be banned,68
Not a lot of turn on the pitch and RCB is playing with 3 spinners.,5
Only ABD can save these mfckers.,7
Is it me or are RCB playing themselves into a hole again,8
How can Ashwin be ethical if he won't even mankad anyone this IPL?,14
"RCB scores a boundary almost every over and DC comebacks with few dot balls.
Good competition.",5
I'm so done with this Yuvraj Singh comparisons,6
Kohli not sledging DC. Strange.,2
Is there any away spinner against ABD for DC?,3
Tuk tuk in the middle overs!! Showing too much respect to mediocre bowlers!! Bringing out of form players back to form!! Imminent Kohlapse!! Just RCB things!!,5
"Iyer said it’s a belter at the toss, expect a settled batsman to tee off at the death",5
Aww Rishabh’s “ez ez ez Ash”,3
We NEED BOUNDARIES,5
RCB and DC managements should talk with each and make sure they both qualify.,10
"Who am I supporting here

Or ami supporting maths again",13
Ashwin getting through his overs beautifully here,3
9 overs 56 wtf,2
[deleted],-4
Koach 24 (21) kinda game?,4
padikkal has a gorgeous late cut,4
"Wtf is this shit? With our bowling, we need to be scoring about 9 per over.",9
CEAT Tyre Strategic Timeout: I Am Inevitable,8
Ashwin being right armed krunal,6
[removed],6
Lmao kohli runs so quick for an easy single,7
"56 in 9 is abysmal, they're done for if Dhawan shows up today",8
So when was the last time Kohli got run out without Rohit being his partner,4
Ashwin Kedarlitharan,5
India Australia test series started?,3
Lebron would go for 30-40 in a big game. Kohli's playing with no intent right now. He's better than this.,3
Ravichandran 'Krunal' Ashwin,12
Kohli isn't even on the lookout for bad balls. He's too focused on placing the ball and running quick.,9
"AB de Villiers, literally the most explosive batsman in the history of cricket, is chafing on the bench, waiting to be unleashed like the Kraken he is. 

But noooo, a nondescript single by Kohli is ""gorgeous wristwork"".",7
I sus Ash bowling action.,4
"Kohli: Let's play this so we both go through

Shreyas: Agreed, let's both go through

Ashwin: mankads everyone

Shreyas: What are you doing?????

Ashwin: backroom deals are unethical",58
Kedar Jadhav had a word with Ashwin or what?,2
Guys RCB is so boring. I would’ve liked to see 80 from 9 overs,3
ABD looks like he needs his fix,3
"With the pitches slowing down, why don't DC try Sandeep Lamichhane instead of Sams?",3
Watch the pitch become an absolute road for DC. They will be 100 in 12 overs,9
ABD looking tense af,2
Kohli will certainly cause a run out today...,6
This is Delhi's best XI,6
"Bruh, DC on top at this point. Only slightly more than 6 rpo.",2
Koach you stupid fuck. You've absolutely lost the plot haven't you. The pitch looks fine af. I bet you're going to bowl siraj in the death as well.,11
"Koach 12 (13)

Padikkal SR gone back below 130

Oh yeah it's all coming together",6
"Love how pant is relatively silent while Koach is on the crease, lmao. Cmon Pant, give it to him.",5
Ponting should field for dc,3
Why not just ask who's gonna win this match,3
"Banana, banana, anyone care for a banana?",1
56 after 9 is absolutely unacceptable,2
I think the only variation left for Ashwin to try is some left arm spin,5
Kedar kohli,5
[deleted],2
IT'S RAINING SINGLES IN ABU DHABI,12
Was that a legal delivery from ashwin?,1
From Kapil Paji and  then Sachin Paji to Mahi Bhai and now Virat Bhaiya lol. How has our dressing room changed.,3
ABD face is like shit here we go again,6
"koach killing kkr's playoff chances- 2020, colourized",8
[deleted],9
"Man, they have started their tuktuk again. Absolutely no intent to be aggresive in the last 3 overs.",7
They have to get some boundaries now. RCB always leaves it for too late and put too much pressure on their middle order.,8
Kl give Kohli some tips,6
Why is dubeji in Indian squad for Australian tour?,4
"Guys, I am worried we are gonna suck ourselves in 8-15 overs. We atleast need a run rate of 10 to give a good target.",4
Best thing about this IPL has been Swans commentary. Comedy and candidness.,7
Why are RCB suddenly batting like how CSK did for 90% of the season,7
Being A RCB fan for years and going through so many heartbreaks i should hv turned completely emotionless by now.. but they always manage to fuck me up..,3
MI pls beat SRH,8
"It looks like RCB is doing well with lots of boundaries, but still they are striking at six barely",3
"I won't blame RCB. They are afraid of a collapse and not even taking the match till the end. Please don't forget their batting line up literally end with ABD. So, play safe and score 160ish so match can be taken to the end.",5
Kohli is a fattu captain and that’s why he never wins any tournament,1
Yes play out your spinners then ABD can do his job,2
"Yesterday kkr lost a wicket in second fucking ball still the runrate was 8+ all the time, and now see this muther frickers",7
"Don't worry bois, we'll pick up rate rate on day 4",12
We need to accelerate RIGHT NOW,5
"Having seen the middle order performances, I can't give Virat crap for batting slow in this match.",3
Disappointed with Steven Smith Lite,5
Ngl I kinda wanted finchy today for this exact reason,6
"Axar should continue, Padikal will have to play in hit out or get out mode in that case and catch chances are high in Abu Dhabi",2
Unrelated but that Godfall game for the ps5 looks like a shitty p2w f2p game,2
It's amazing how powerful Kohli's presence in the game is when batting. Through sheer force of will he's managed to convince a large percentage of the cricketing community that it's actually fine for a T20 number 3 to go at a run a ball for half the innings when the team has only lost one wicket in the powerplay.,7
When it's coming out well and they'll middling most of balls why can't they score more than 7-8 pee over.,3
"Never thought there’d be a timeline where RCB’s bowling is the strong point. The batting lineup feels like a combination of Tuk Tuk + inexperience + one ABD. DDP has been cool though I guess, he gets a pass with his strike rate since it’s his first season",3
Sledge kohli you cowards.,5
Just hoping kohli doesn’t put too much pressure on padikkal,1
"Kohli himself admitted that they tend to slow down too much in the middle overs in the last post-match interview and yet he’s back to playing 6 run overs. 

This ends up putting too much pressure on ABD because the middle order after him can’t be trusted to score big.",4
People shitting on low run rate which sets up a small total                 Delhi's fragile batting unit- allow us to introduce ourselves,7
When you know 160 is almost not defendable at this pitch and even a 184 and 195 has been successfully chased in the past week. You can't be 12(13),6
I don't think this has been a bad start at all for RCB,3
"Kohli needs to push the acceleration NOW - he's played 10 balls, stabilised, now is the time.",5
I am okay with this as long as they dont get out without attacking bowlers,3
Rcb taking inspiration form CSK,9
Imagine if Ashwin just freezes mid action. Like statue.,9
I am counting the strategic timeout 😭,3
[deleted],1
Take a single and pray for AB. That's all that's happening on the pitch,2
RCB is batting way too slow and ended up getting 160 or less,7
Why is DC so bad? 1 wicket after 9 overs with their bowling?,5
Kohli's has been struggling this whole season except 2-3 games is not a good sign,8
Chakka kab lagega? By tea?,2
"I absolutely despise Kohli's approach this IPL, these are t20s ffs, not ODIs.",4
"Guys,what should be my submission for #BingoChallenge for a reward of lifetime of free potato chips?",2
I love how commentators are speculating pitch conditions based on Rcb's batting,6
What has happened to kohli. Wtf.,3
Why the fuck are both anchoring? This is just shit,3
Should Sundar be used as Pinch hitter like KKR does with Narine?,2
Singles aren't gonna cut it virat.,2
Match will be won or lost in the next 5 overs,2
5d move by koach so that he can train for australia series better and get no 1 test position again,10
"This ain't an odi boi, wake tf up.",4
"Padikkal: brings the RR up.

Koach: not on my watch. rotate.",2
Koach be running after every hit by default,1
Kohli needs to stop with this approach. Frustrating.,1
Meanwhile RCB and DC fans reverse jinxing each other,4
DDP with 452 runs this season is the highest for an uncapped Indian on debut ipl season. Broke Iyer's 439 in 2015.,10
Axar has had a good tournament. I really don’t like him as a player lol,1
"If you are not going to attack Axar, then whom?",3
If Delhi fans want their team to loose then tell their players to sledge Kohli;),1
"Last few games, it seriously felt like we had 5 fielders on the field, looks like 25 today",8
"Looks like RCB have ZERO faith in their middle order

Since Gurkeerat thala Singh ain’t there today",6
All RCB players look nervous.,5
Any other player would have been dropped for the way Kohli is playing. This is not how you play T20,5
I wanted a nice relaxing test match to unwind. But why aren't they wearing white?,2
Pant is silent when Kohli is batting,7
Hahah apparently doobz may come next,1
Next over 13 runs guaranteed,2
Wtf,3
Thank fuck,5
"Two wickets now pls, and this can end quickly. Better for all of our hearts.",2
I still count down the CEAT tyres strategic timeout. It reminds me of when I was a kid,6
"KL Rahul got criticism for his SR but only 1 guy in RCB lineup has batting SR better than him in IPL 2020. His team had Pooran, Gayle and Mayank for balance.",9
Tactical drop,7
OMGGGG,2
My fear is decreasing whatsorcery,3
If they wanted to play this safe why not open up with AB and Kohli?,7
Nokia wtf man?,8
Gotte muh mai the,9
Thanks agent nortje,7
Nortje saved the match for delhi.,8
It's weird to see the other team not going batshit insane and smashing us all over the ground after the last couple of games,2
Dyaumnn bouy,2
Man I miss Deccan chargers looking at DC.,4
Gand marwa lo behen chod. Fuck this shit,4
5d move by not getting ab to come,9
Lmfao tactical drop,12
Is the pitch not a T20 kind of a pitch or is it Kohli again trying to play a T20 like an ODI?,7
"That's a big drop

Looked like a regulation catch tbh",5
Nortje going to get spanking by Kaif and Punter bhai,4
Ah love that South African DNA...,6
"Pant when others are batting : 💁

Pant when Kohli is batting : 🤐",9
That's big,3
WTF,6
Tactical drop^TM,12
Ponting looks like he wants to kill himself,7
Guysssssssss there's is a sign,2
Nortje playing 4D chess there,9
Wtf boi noo mmmmmmmmmn,3
Wtf are you doing Kohli??,2
Holy fucking shit. Ladoo dropped,4
"ngl, Nokia just saved DC 10-15 runs.",7
Watch koach go onto to make 87 from 51,3
Catch ko No-kia,3
I got a mini heart attack ngl.,3
You can’t do that with Kohli,3
AB is like: wtf are these guys playing... ODI?,3
Tactical drop.,9
Ha ha ha. What kind of a joker level fielding was that!,2
Man wtf has happened to Kohli.,2
Tactical drop?,5
Punter is fucking livid,3
You just dropped the IPL mate,2
Don't know what goes in kohli's head. Dafuq does he expect to score 200 runs in the next 10 overs.,3
This is not rightnotcoolim very hurt deeply,6
Chokli,3
"Please make them pay, please for the love of god",2
Tactical drop by Nortje,9
Can't believe  i am saying this - How many more deliveries before Kohli gets out :((,5
Fucking run rate of 6,2
*Gote mu mai aaye the*,3
Punter: did he just drop our playoff spot?,3
Tactical drop,7
"Koach BC, laddoo diya tha.",3
"Goddamn it

13(16) would've looked fuckin beautiful",5
Come onnnnn Nortjeeeeeee.....,4
Tactical drop?,5
Koach is definitely dealing in 1's and 2's after that,4
Man DC Really doesn't want ABD to bat,8
Fuckkkk,4
Dropped the match their bud,3
Come on Nokia... Can't drop Kohli like this.. damn it,6
Dude dropped the IPL,6
Was that a tactical drop,4
Your stream is fine. That's just Ashwin.,3
inb4 ESPNcricinfo smartstat predicting that drop saved DC 100 runs,1
Noooooo Nokia wtfff,2
There are we .... Playing one day on this good batting pitch,2
I ma happy that kohli isn't gone.,3
Strategic drop. Good one DC!,5
L lag gayi 😒,3
"Poor Ponting, his expression say it all",4
DC is utter trash.,3
300 in 50 overs?,5
What the hell was that,2
Safe to say players from both sides are on edge this game.,2
Run a ball after 10,5
chu............................,3
Ponting looks dead inside.,5
Pant needs bariatrics surgery.,2
"The way Axar has bowled today shows it was stupid to drop him last game imo

You wouldn't drop an off spinner if there were loads of right handers in the opposition",4
Nortje with the 4D chess bois,3
You dont drop Koach. I think he is gonna make this one count.,1
brotha that's game over if you catch that,2
 It's just Nortje day when you drop a sitter like that.,3
That was an absolute goober,2
Another match where Padikkal is playing for his 50,3
"No Kohli that is not Ben Stokes, that is Anrich Nortje. I don't know why Kohli is calling him Ben Stokes.",3
Nokia with a 5d move to drop Kohli to keep the scoring rate low,6
"Bad cricket all round. Shitty batting, shitty fielding. Clearly we are seeing two teams who have gotten used to losing matches.",2
In before ESPN smart stats on how that drop helped Delhi,5
Koach with the big luck. Can he cash in?,2
Big brain move dropping Kohli,2
Maa chuduao apni behnchod,7
"It's okay Nortje, RCB will definitely return the favor",5
Man the catching from Delhi was at a different level of good earlier in the tournament,2
Phir bhi hagega Kohli apna... Jitna mauka dedo..,4
Please guys target someone. anyone. 20 runs short excuse wouldn't work it will cost a playoff berth today.,3
Not a fucking tactical drop if it's Kohli you're dropping,6
Fucker at least get out and let ABD get his eye in,4
"Is it just me, or is this super boring? Like RCB knows DC won't try to chase any target in 18 overs and risk losing wickets, so it looks like they're just aiming to score 150.",3
Tactical drop? Seriously though getting Kohli out would be bad if you can't get ABD out quickly.,2
Ponting is gonna murder Nokia omg,5
"Watch this shit

Sees off Axar, and will attack Rabada",3
These two batsmen looking set for next 2 sessions of Day1.,1
60/1 in 10 overs 😨😨,2
Incoming 50 (40) from Kohli,3
Even if they score 100 in next 10 that won't be enough. FFS!,3
Nortje knew what he was doing.,2
Koach: this is why I score in singles,1
Someone would've told Kohli that 140 is above par score in this pitch. smh,3
4D chess from Nortje not letting AB come in,4
Pressure on us rn. So much worried,2
Kohli has been garbage this season. Sucks all the momentum out in the middle overs,6
"Nokia 5d chess, dropped Kohli to kep run rate low.",7
Nice ODI. Great stage to go for 350+!,5
This is so frustrating. They are playing run a ball. Wtf,3
Now delhi are not pissed they are fuckin scared.,3
Koach is batting today not Kohli,4
"kohlis lost the form, he used to tonk these out of the boundary whenver he stepped out, fuck",3
BC ab toh 6 rpo peh bhi nahi jaa rahe,2
Wicket alert.,1
That drop might save DC 10 to 20 runs,7
Wtf was that camera work for last ball,1
10 overs 1 wicket just play a T10 match ( However that is played).,2
Dropping that catch was a wise choice when abd has to come next.,2
Kohli is seriously not in form man.,6
"Waiting for Kohli to say ""The pitch changed drastically in the 2nd innings"" in the post match presentation",5
Another terrible throw from Kolhi after taking forever to get a move on. Only this time he was lucky the catch was dropped..,5
12(17) and 14(17) Fuck,4
"DC's plan.

Take no wickets for 15 overs, then let ABD come in to hit 100 off 20.",3
Kohli out in next 2 overs,3
"Kohli to Nortje: "" You've just dropped the IPL Cup""",7
Kohli looks desperate.,6
Koach is horribly out of form,7
I like this matchup,3
"Our batting went downhill, I don't see us winning IPL",8
RCB don't deserve playoffs if this is how they approach a T20,2
"Someone needs to tell RCB that they're playing in a T20 match, and not an ODI.

60 runs out of the first 10, with 9 wickets at hand ...... in a critical match ..... is embarassing.",5
Needless opinion : Since RR with partnership with Niine have been trying to create awareness about periods.. JSW could have used that rainbow coloured Jersey to promote LGBTQ+ thing... Instead of just coming up really bad tagline,7
I mean by the looks of it it's better if Kohli stays on tuk tuks the innings,3
Kohli looks a bit out of shape.,1
Kohli is engaging i am worried.,3
Kohli 13(16) would have been beautiful :(,12
Je baat!,2
Man the commentary is biased ngl,3
"Kohli will just whack everything now, could be dangerous",8
Relax DC fans. Trust me you'd rather want Kohli there than ABD.,8
KOACH TIKE,4
Kohli is so out of form but can still hit cover drives in his sleep,8
Why RCB do tuk tuk ?,3
Camera's going to pan to Nortje every time Kohli scores a run now lmao,12
Kohli might be a great player. But he is shit in crunch situations.,3
Beautiful shot!,1
Ponting is ticking.,4
Kohli out this over,1
Shaw found his best friend,3
Fucking finally,1
KOACH WILL PLAY TODAY. MARK MY WORDS,1
Someone remind RCB that they are playing T20,5
He's gonna keep hitting now,4
Ugh... Can't wait to see an extra animated Kohli on the field to compensate for the no-show with the bat! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,3
lol kohli... either six or out....,2
"Man, I can already see us scoring 140 and DC chasing it within 16 overs",10
Aur Karo maa ki chut Kohli ko drop,4
Nokia is gonna get a spank for every run koach scores.,10
Seems like a strategic drop.,8
Dropped the fucking game!!!!!,1
Kohli can't slog any bowlers above the windies current t20 attack.,0
Bruh I'm scared they dropped Koach and they have ABD up next,4
"Some RCB fans after that drop: arey yaar sahi pakad leta 😒  
T: catch bro",2
8D chess move by kohli to try get shivam dube into form,3
Still dont getbwhy RCB is being very cautious. You cant be too cautious,4
RCB just lost the match with that dropped catch.,3
"This IPL has been a good preparation for AUS tour by Kohli. Just had some hiccups in the 90(55).

And as I type this he hits a 4.",10
What was Kohli mouthing after that drop? Was he unhappy with the opposition fielding?,13
"After that drop, Kohli trying to hit shots for his ego now....",9
Time for Padikkal to go beserk,7
163 target kinda game,3
What the fuck our batting has been HORRIBLE lately,8
Rabada can smell blood,9
Kohli 13(16) was so close to my prediction of 15(18),7
I don't mind this tuk tuk at all I know we don't have batting after 4. It is only top 4 or bust,3
I think even I could have caught that. That will be the end for the year I am afraid,9
"Nortje doing SA things, not surprised ;-;",3
Great shot for a single,2
ABD is like wtf get the camera off me,12
Butt-esque drop,2
Everything to the fielders.,3
Big Breaking news : anything over 170 and Punter will open the batting for DC.,29
"2016 kohli would've dropped 2020 kohli for the lack of intent,and replace him with sachin baby.",106
"Padikkal watching stalwarts of the game choke with the bat: fine, I'll do it myself",10
Play out Axar and go after Rabada. Got it.,5
How many fielders they got man?,5
AB is the happiest person when a catch is dropped,3
Even Gaikwad can chase this down in 8 overs. Come on fellas!,5
in b4 kohli gets out to rabada trying to hit him for six,3
Every run Kohli makes is gonna bring Nortje on screen.,8
DC has no incentive to chase down whatever RCB score in 17 overs. I think KKR's fate now relies on SRH/MI,4
Field placement today is PRETTY GOOD,3
DC fans so pessimistic,2
Rcb keeping the score low so DC doesn't lose by 20+ runs 🙏 friendship <3,4
If ABD gets out cheap... RCB will be in trouble....,3
If IPL 2021 is decided to be ODI league just for shits and giggles then I'm way too certain that RCB would win by a lot like a fucking LOT,3
dropping kohli catch on purpose,8
Come on pant show Kohli your sledging skills.,6
Ddp plays the best looking shots for a single.,5
"Watching Kohli in this IPL gives me hope for India in the Australia series - he's been kinda shit, so maybe he'll compensate and India will only lose 3-0? 

One can only dream.",7
"Just realised dc isn't playing a leg spinner against rcb (for ab)

Abd 100 incoming",8
RCB should be targeting 170 here,2
"Imagine Rahul, Kohli and Iyer of IPL 2020 playing for India at 2,3 and 4 lmao nightmare",6
ABD expression: ye log test match khel rahe kya?,3
"So, the strategy is to play out Nortje, Rabad (thats 8 overs). Score run a ball off Ashwin and Axar. And try to score off Daniel Sams coz hes the new guy (which ain't working out too well)! We will start scoring from the 21st over maybe...",11
Padikkal sure does look class. Id love to see him in red ball.... with about 12 other guys vying for those two spots too,4
Idc who wins. I need Bumrah to get that fucking cap,6
We are already 20 runs short.. ACCELERATE,27
Every shot is going to fielder,8
Virat Kohli should change his name to Virat Slowly,103
"Feel like shit, want 2016 Kohli back",29
Tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk,4
That rainbow jersey of DC is so much better,5
Crowd seems really up for it after that boundary lol.,2
tuk tuk Koach,6
That rainbow DC kit was good,2
"RCB knows about dew incoming in 2nd innings, so why don't they accelerate knowing that they need at least 160+",5
"If KL gets criticized for playing slow, Kohli should be too. Dude plays at an even lower SR than KL",8
The run rate is abysmal,7
[deleted],0
Bruh padikkal leg side game is so good to watch but he keeps picking the fielders.,3
Big brain Koach using Thala's Tuk Tuk^TM strategy to win a season after having failed to win so many by using his aggressive koach^TM strategy,10
I'm going to remain angry at nortje until kohli gets out.,5
DDP post Powerplay really needs to find boundaries.,7
Padikkal is just trying to increase his avg and get good price in auction,3
Wow 8 runs that's a massive over for RCB,6
"As Gimli said, ""It was intentional, it was intentional!""",1
What if I tell you we're getting 190 here........ I'll be lying for sure,2
Koach getting valuable batting practice for the OZ ODI series!,3
AB De Villiers these days reminds me of a young Undertaker. Not kidding.,1
"The way this is going, it is not going to end well for us TBH.",2
RCB loves to play ODI cricket even in a t20,2
"Paddikal, if you pick out Shaw you dont get an automatic 6...stahp.",1
Say it quietly. Kohli has been tuk tuk this IPL,2
"Dare I say it again, Kohli is the problem in the RCB line up.",5
why every ball is going to fielders :(,1
I bet 10 coins on RCB since I want DC to win. Either way I win tonight.,2
PLEASE KOACH. We need your 2016 innings,1
"100 in last 10 is not hard to get considering only 1 wicket has fallen, 160 170 has to be a safe score man, anything less is worruing",1
"11 overs, 68. WTF are you doing Koach!",2
So many Yuvraj comparisons,1
Now Iyer will needlessly bowl stoinis ehen we don't even need to,1
Exactly what purpose does Deep Dasgupta serve in that My11Circle ad?,2
Danny Morrison loves his abbreviations,1
Desperately need AB to go big.,1
No intent from RCB or excellent bowling? Or both teams have an agreement ?,1
They need to score atleast 10 per against bowlers like rabada and nortje to score don't defendable score.,1
Koach is preparing for the DN Test,3
Kohli please. Gtfo. Can't have two accumulators. One of them has to go.,4
"Is anybody else noticing this phenomenon with a lot of batsmen. They get a good start usually 25(15) or sth like that and then slow down as they start approaching 50. This is not how it should be, once you are set you need to continuously find boundaries and keep that strike rate constant if not improve it.",3
"_When Nortje dropped Kohli_

Commentators: RCB fans will be pleased with drop

RCB fans: Fucking Nortje, 5D chess with the strategic drop",2
AB trying to move away from his innocent image with that Chad facial hair lol,4
"Kohli post match presentation ""we were 30 runs below par"" incoming!",4
Barely going above run a ball after 11 overs in a crunch game. What even is this.,2
This 100 SR shit from Kohli throughout this season is so overrated. Works like 5% of the time.,4
"RCB Fans - ohh man, we dont have enough runs.. we going to lose


DC Fans - dont have enough wickets, abd to come next.. we'll lose",7
Germs ko na karo!!,2
"KL getting shat for low SR, Kohli getting shat for low SR             I wonder what happens when Iyer comes to bat",3
Inb4 stoinis comes in and gets koach with his deadly fulltosses,5
how do other teams accelerate but we always collapse every time we try?,2
Kohli maar na bkl.,1
This Colgate Vedshakti ad just needs a Brazzer logo at the bottom,2
Bring Sams on and let's see if Kohli has an issue with the left armers,1
Was Ashwin running in SloMo?,3
Wtf type of running is that ashwin??,2
Who tf was saying wicket alert,1
Lmao,1
What the fuck Ash. Imagine your fielder does this with 3 needed off last ball,7
Why was ashwin jogging? Is he hurt?,6
Ashwin why was he jogging?? lmao,5
Ashwin walking in the park,7
Why does Ashwin run in slow motion lmao,3
drop might be a blessing in disguise for Delhi,2
If Koach bats till the 16th over... RCB will be under 160.,2
That was some Rayudu level running by ashwin,2
Lol that shot,1
Don't tire your top run scorer bc,1
"WTF Ashwin, that was ridiculous fielding.. utter shit",3
DP & Kohli on 3 & 4 on orange cap list,1
What running was that,3
"inb4 Paddikal out or big shots next over

&#x200B;

My stream is two balls late",3
Bc ashwin jogging wtf,8
Why was Ashwin uncle running so lazily?,6
Why was Ashwin jogging there?,8
Ashwin doesn't have sprinting shoes on.,9
WTF Aswin. Do you have piles?,12
Ashwin jogging calmy lol,8
Ash going for a stroll there,7
Lol fatwin doesn't want to roll his ankle by jogging.,4
Lmfao what was that,5
"Lol @ ashwin

Arre ash yaar",5
Why was ashwin so slow,2
Ashwin dont give a fuck.,8
""" Arey ash yaar""",5
Ashvin was just strolling.,4
DDP gonna get tired out Kohli relax,3
Does Kohli want RCB to absolutely not qualify. 100 SR in a virtual KO game. Jeez!!,2
"Man, ashwin was almost doing a casual evening jog, he was certainly not chasing the ball there...",2
100 SR 😳😳,1
6s maarna bhul gaye kya nc,1
"LMAO, so fucking casual from Ashwin in the field..",3
"Oh my god, what is this Aa karo ad, lol. Looks like a porno.",4
Why the fuck is Padikkal not attacking man..,2
"Ashwin was like ""fuck this, not worth getting injured""",9
Ashwin is shit,1
Maar na ❤️du,2
They ran 3?!,7
Wtf was Ash doing there? Jogging...,8
wtf happened to Koach man :(,3
"let me have a quick wank, rabada aaa karo.",3
Runs on board is still good,1
Padikal stamina is finished.,6
lmao ashwin chasing the ball like an old man,1
[deleted],5
The outfield looks slow today.,0
I have seen pregnant women move faster than Ashwin does on the field.,3
"Kohli pulling a Rahul here. 

Also, props to Pant for all the upbeat bakbak.",4
Looks like Ashwin doesn't want Axar to have a better economy than him,3
lmao paddikal in 3rd for orange cap,6
ODI cricket just seems like such a joke compared to modern t20,1
Ashwin’s fielding /\,1
And you tell me everything is not fixed.,0
Ashwin with morning walk there lol.,3
"Honestly, if RCB can get to 140, they can still win this.

DC's batting is very dependent on two players: Dhawan and Stoinis. The rest are mediocre to garbage. Prithvi Shaw is awful. Rahane, Iyer and Pant are mediocre and inconsistent with the bat. 

If RCB gets Dhawan out early, it's game over. Doesn't matter what they're chasing.",1
Axar is not easy to hit. Target others.,1
"The only person who can get excused from such an innings so far is Kohli because he has shown time and again that he can accelerate after 15 overs. But if he gets out, he will have screwed the team.",10
Padikkal needs to put some muscles and work on fitness. He starts off well but seem to be losing energy for the big shots after PP everytime.,7
Kohli after sometime- We fell short by 20 runs,2
Ashwin is throwing wtf,1
Shot,4
Virat was seeing the big screen? LOL if true.,2
We need TO ACCELERATE PLS,2
"Ashwin slowly jogging to the ball, while koach rushes for a third run lol",6
Ashwin = William Carvalho,1
... this wasn't in the script,4
Don't get carried away pls,2
Finally choke hits a 6,1
45 ball 50 from DDP is fucking useless. We need to get moving.,2
Pant speaker back,3
Yeah it's over for Delhi now,3
54 off 46 courtesy of that six,2
That drop is gonna fuck us to Neptune and beyond,5
"Camera pans to Nortje


Love it",5
CLASSSSSSSSSSSSSS,5
LETS GO VK,3
I like DCs fielding today. It shows intent. It's ok if we lose :'(,9
Where is the Nortje cam?,7
This is stupid,2
dafaq this vedashakti ad lmao ... Rabada lmao,2
Nortje you dimwit,6
Standard shot of Nortje after every Kohli boundary,13
Even 2020 Pant can chase this. They need to set target for 2018 Pant.,5
ahh finally. redemption,4
About fucking time Virat,1
"Kohli, please dont take huge chances.",1
Koach rhymes with Choke,2
"Don't care if you're a DC fan, that's gotta make you at least smile a bit.",2
Pant: oye well done.. well done axe...,5
Imagine having South Africans anywhere near a knockout match,14
Everyone talking about Virats slow innings but no lets strike at 100 SR,1
Jeez DDP seeing Kohli running for the third is a r/watchpeopledieinside moment,8
F U N O R T J E,3
Man paddikkal looks tired as fuck,3
Make way for the KING,0

I think that these two teams will meet again in final of the IPL.,2
Is this the 1st 6 for Kohli this season? O.o,2
Ashwin running like he got a sack of rice for belly,5
I desperately want Kohli and AB to win a championship,9
"Let Kohli get to 50, the acceleration will be insane",9
"Genuine Q, should Kohli be opening the batting? Allows him to take advantage of the powerplay, get a high score, then anchor the middle. His most successful seasons came with him opening (2016+2015), and RCB made playoffs both times.",7
Start slogging now!!,1
Koach just needs to say the b word once and then he'll be good,4
Don't show nokia show 4x zoom of ponting.,8
Here comes trouble.,3
Kohli apology thread on the horizon?,4
So the camera is going to pan towards Nokia after each Kohli boundary,24
fuck offf nortje,6
RunningBetweenTheWicketsPorn.mp4,1
If we don't get wickets soon we are dead,3
160 is not too far.,2
"Now that Padikjal has scored 30+, with how many runs will RCB win!",4
"why do commentators collectively orgasm when kohli hits one six, one that was a long time coming. this run rate is inadequate in a virtual knockout game",8
I reverse jinxed the six oof,3
"Why is pant so silent today? He needs to make some sound man!!

Make things interesting. The run rate is below 7. This is really boring for such an important match!",3
"Pant - Pareshan mat ho

  


T: Hakuna Matata",3
Chutiya Nortje,3
"I've been in the position of dropping a crucial catch and it hurting your team and it feels shit 

Probably feels a hundred times worse when it's an important game and you're a professional cricketer",3
Kohli did that? 4D cheating lol!,5
kohli looks fine now... should get them to 170 with ABD,2
They could have got 10 extra runs if they attacked Axar in the previous over as well,0
[deleted],2
"This year's orange cap list looks like a joke , the usual people are still there but no one has been that impressive",8
Come on kohli more aggression,1
200 iq by Kohli watching broadcast while running,13
class observation from Swann that,12
Virat Kohli apology thread coming today?,-1
DDP is dying out there trying to run with kohli,11
"DDP looks done, best to swing",3
Pant's chirping has been more annoying than usual.,4
10-15 runs behind at this point imo.,2
"DDP always looks so good for the first 30 balls, after that he seems like he's out of air or something...",3
Kohlis batting still seems like too much effort for a 110-130 SR,0
"Brilliant from Swanny there picking up the nuances, even more brilliant from Koach",2
ashwin was multi tasking on thinking who to bring in for his next podcast while going after the ball.,11
Paddy looks tired,2
Virat looking at the screen while running the second one to check what the fielder was doing. Streetsmart™,4
Here comes chuckwin,3
Wow appearantly Virat looked at the live feed of the match to see Ashwin jogging,4
Wtf Padikkal let's go man. Time to whack,5
I think we need nokia cam .,2
Want Ashwin to take wickets and get back into the LOI team. Also want rcb to win the match. CONFUSION,2
That catch I wish wasn't dropped,1
"Kohli will go on to make an 80+ score and RCB will win by 23 runs. 
In the post match interview, Ponting will publicly execute Nokia. You heard it first here folks",4
Ash bowled really well....,1
"How do you stop Ashwin from jogging while fielding?


Get him to bowl",0
I miss the time when the commentators use to chat directly with the on field players,1
They need to go for it now...,2
DC won't chase more than 160,2
"In the past there was a stat for every match which showed how many runs the fielder saved in the field.

That should be regular thing and should be added to player profile and runs scored after dropped catches be added to that fielder.",5
That poll is more like asking who has more fans,10
the greatest batsmen like kohli and smith are already in form for their odi and test knocks. Will be watching smith bat like 2 days now in a match,1
Seeing that Fan Poll- *Sad Delhi Fan Noises*,2
DDP definitely losing his shape a bit now,6
"everytime DDP bat with kohli, he gets tired af. he will get out soon",2
"What a convoluted way to ask who will the match, that poll",1
"Paddikal should start hitting, taking till the end won't do him much good as Rabada and Nortje will be hard to hit. Koach can take on them better if he stays on the pitch longer.",1
I predict 140,1
"Quick Stat:   
Kohli SR  of 120.85 is **second lowest among top 25** run scorers this IPL. Only Gill has scored slower at 117.96.",1
Was that Jadhav bowling lol,5
Padikkal fuck u if you can't hit at least rotate the strike,1
Ddp hit wicket now. You've got your 30,1
C'mon ashwin do a Bumrah next,2
Ddp is out of juice,2
"Time for AB I think. Dev should go down slogging.  
  
Edit: fuck",2
Padikkal pla get out,1
Paddikal looks tired running with Kohli,2
Koach need to play a Morgan innings from yesterday!,2
Next 8 overs 80 runs.,2
Ashwin learning from Jadhav,5
Man DDP looks exhausted,5
Great bowling by Ashwin ngfl,4
Ashwin is chucking.,2
Ugh Ashwin I love you man but I’m not loving the kedar Jadhav ball,5
Every over AB is not playing is -2 for RCB,2
DDP is a PP bully. Change my mind.,4
They really need to get going or else there's gonna be too much pressure on Abd,2
Will be fun if Ashwin mankads Kohli.,3
"Josh messed it up big time,We need experienced players in Knockouts.Aaron Finch would be good here.We could be looking at a 100 now.",2
I'm going to start rooting for RCB now I think. Less chance of disappointment.,3
A few quick runs and padikkal gets exhausted,5
Paddikal should work on his stamina.,4
Fuck my nightmare,4
Man these side arm balls feel so wrong,6
Look at DC dugout clapping lmaoooo,12
Ethics,2
No stamina DDP,3
Umpires really need call that chucking action. It's high time,0

Koach vs Bumrah and Koach vs Ashwin ego battles are lovely to watch.,5

Kohli has lost his T20 touch,3
That might actually work against dc.,2
Kohli isn't cut out for T20s. Same as Smith. They both should stick to tests and ODIs.,-5
Stoinis lovely,1
Throw in the towel already.,1
Stoinis and KG boutta make me cry,4
Ego ethically detoxed,7
RCB batting = ABDV,1
Love watching Ashwin bowl. Great memories of Dhoniconda Choke with Ashwin and Jadeja in ODI middle overs.,7
Does Kohli not take ipp seriously? He is a much better player when playing for India,7
RABADA didn't want that hug haha,5
Ya keep running 10 2s and don’t have enough to hit the ball for a six. Kohli should focus on odi and tests .,2
Stoinis being dramatic lol,3
Only Koach knows whats wrong with him.,6
"Yeah, was worried he would get out without the acceleration",3
AD de Villiers time,1
Looks like RCB is gonna post a huge target.. Because after this Aswhin's quota is over and ABD is really good player of pace.,3
DC has a great cohesion & chemistry between their players,3
Ffs Kohli! 🤦‍♀️,0
Please AB. Your the only hope I have left,2
"The Paddikal batting template:

Hit a couple of aerial strikes in the powerplay 

Run 

Look elegant af

Get tired af after 30 balls 

Look tired 

Miscue attempted big hits 


Look more tired 


Eventually get out at 53 (45)",123
RCB should score at least 80 more here to be competitive,1
140 score anyone,2
Naacho BC,1
Called it bois ..  Padikkal just wants his 50 . Fuck the team,7
AB has to hit hard now,1
ABD to carry once again...,3
Lol the man got a standing ovation from the team.,5
Get AB soon and DC will be chasing 140,2
In before ABD's Assault,1
"**12.3** Ashwin to Kohli, OUT, **taken at deep midwicket!** **82-2**

V Kohli c Stoinis b Ashwin 29 (24b 2x4 1x6) SR: 120.83",2
Kohli should workout to bulk than lean,2
RCB do not deserve to go through based on Koachs performances. The team is ultimately based on him.,6
Never doubt Ashwin anna's intellect,3
People are different. There they are celebrating Virat Kohli is out and here I am celebrating casue ABD is here,3
That wicket should be added to Paddikal. He was playing too slow and that added pressure on Virat.,2
Unpopular opinion: Kohli wasn't that bad,6
Padikkal be like whew,2
"Kohli and getting out to spinners, name a better combo",1
Koach helping delhi with tiring DDP and giving his wicket away,4
I like DC. They have a great vibe and a good balance. But that guy Shreyas gives me the heebie- jeebies.,4
[deleted],6
"RCB is the only company in Bangalore that outsources everything. Over to you, AB!",6
Kohli looks uncharacteristically under pressure. His low strike rate for first 20 odd deliveries must be playing on his mind.,1
Fuck Padikkal,1
Fucking love Ashwin what a legend,5
Royal Chokers Bengaluru :''((((((,2
DDP gets tired after playing 8 overs,1
DC helped RCB by taking bc test Kohli wicket.,1
abd in dugout : tumlog ki galtiyo ka tokra kab tak apne sar par leke ghumu.,3
Why didn't they cross ffs!,1
"The AB de Villiers paradox - I watch cricket mainly to see him play but I also get nervous he'll get dismissed so I kind of don't want to see him bat..?

It's so stupid.",10
"I am one of your biggest fans ABD, but plz, get out early today..",1
Last wicket for RCB standing before tail begins,2
Why didn't they save ashwin for abd?,1
What a catch,1
Paddikal slows down. Doesn’t he. With experience he’s gonna be a gem,2
Imagine Ponting’s reaction if Stoinis stepped back onto the rope,6
[deleted],1
"Get AB, and RCB won’t even make 125",5
This guy AB scares me tbh,5
"Jatin Sapru gets orgasms saying ""best vs best ki ladai"".",6
you can never keep ashwin out of the game.,2
Kohli did his job prevented a collapse,3
Who gonna win matches for Team India except Bumrah now that Rohi is out too.,0
Ashwin making me jizz rn,3
Does RCB getting more votes in that poll mean there are more DC fans trying to reverse jinx things? XD,6
"I guess we need to remember that being a 3 format player really messes you up. 

KL Rahul struggled in tests for a long time after adapting his game for T20's.

I think we may be seeing a similar thing with Kohli",2
Guess Kohli got great practice for tests against Pakistan in UAE,0
Abd looks like a man on mission,3
I just hope both teams have fun,1
AB looked nervous in the dug out. Hope he doesn’t choke today,1
"Even going down the pitch, he couldn't hit it over the fence",1
C'mon get AB,1
This is what happens when you try unethical shots.,2
Kohli's eyes lol,3
Ashwin the goat,3
"Kohli out, pant found his voice back",7
all hopes on AB now. please take us to 180,7
"If we can restrict em to 150 from here, it'll be a success",0
"Banger:Ashwin is brilliant, waiting for Kohli to make the initial movement and bowl to the legs. 

Ashwin hearing the BS: :-|",3
Pant is so irritating to listen.  No idea how these batsmen do it,4
Kohli has been great in only one match. Very below average ipl for his standard. Hope he finds more confidence in the Australia tour.,10
It is poetically ironic that VK is the best we have got(with respect to the Indian team) but he keeps getting out cheaply in high-stake matches.,2
If they don’t keep Swanny in the dugout next season I riot,3
I can see DDP getting out in the next over.,6
When was the last time DDP hit a boundary?,4
Is it just me but is it a bit weird that Pant ain’t wearing a full sleeve shirt while keeping,8
[deleted],5
Inb4 Kohli bowls Siraj at the death,7
Bowl leg spin ashwin,2
"Predicting it now, ABD is gonna fail today. It's too much pressure",6
Man it’s nice being an MI fan watching the world burn,7
Ashwin's one of India's best spinners,2
Lmao have never heard any crowd chant Ashwin Ashwin like this,8
"Watching Koach in IPL sometimes, makes me feel even Manish Pandey is better than him",3
Koaaaach BC,2
"At least he showed intent now. But man, you can't help but want more from the best player in the world.",4
Kolhi has lost his touch in T20. Never seen him struggle so much to clear the boundary.,12
1 more wicket and the game is DC's.,7
Ex-RCBian catching Koach,9
"Kohli hits a 6 

Everyone : Kohli redemption time

Ashwin : wouldn't be too ethical if Kohli scores after being dropped.",30
I'm scared of ABD... He looks in the mood for a big innings today :/,2
Great spell from Ashwin terrific comeback from that KKR shitshow,5
Padikkal is losing his team the match playing these slow ass innings.,1
"Why is Kohli not able to clear the boundary, gets caught right at the boundary.",6
Orgasmic bowling,3
40(35) ptsd,3
Kohli actually looks like a GOAT now with the bits of gray in his hair,6
If nortje gets abd out early he's forgiven.,1
I came ready to be disappointed and I'm still disappointed 😔,2
WhiteHat Jr is a bigger scam than Byju's,4
AB has been a bit of a bunny for Ethical mind. He will be relieved his spell is done.,1
Chutiya Ashwin never bowled like this when he was playing for KXIP,1
"Anything below 140 and unless you have Mumbai tier bowling, Delhi can choke their way through",1
"I think we're past peak 🐐 Kohli from 2014-2018. 

Now, he's just another batter in the team.",7
"Fuck's sake DDP.


Go big now",1
Ashwin will be out of field in no time now..,2
"Paddikal S/R after 18 Balls :150
Paddikal S/R now : 114",3
"Brilliant spell of 4-18-1 from Ashwin, so underrated, whole season be has done well for us..",7
Excellent spell from Ash!,3
the pitch becomes so much easier to bat in 2nd innings. WE NEED RUNS,3
one tip one hand?,2
Stoinis actually did well to stop the acceleration backwards... most other players would have gone out of the boundary,5
Just joined. Why so much tuktuk? Is it that hard to play?,2
Even 10 run per over gets just fucking 150!,1
"Ashwin knew he would get the wicket of Kohli, that is why he didn't even run for that ball.",7
"AB can drag em to 180, need him out asap",4
Padikkal needs to work on his fitness,7
[deleted],6
"DDP, do something.",1
"I would expect someone like Koach to put that in gap rather trying to get over the fielder.

Hopefully he will be back in form for Aus tour.",3
what do you reckon is chasable here?,1
DDP wasting balls,1
Is this the first time Ashwin has got Kohli out?,2
Ashwin showing kohli that he can also take wickets in middle overs.,4
AB is here (Awayspin bunny),-2
I still can't tell if we're suddenly good again or if RCB are that bad,6
Rabada vs abd wowwwww,3
"Padikkal is not playing his role, as set batsman it's his duty to take on the opposition to buy Kohli time to settle but he ends up playing anchor leading to added pressure on Kohli who is already playing anchor",3
Is dew going to come in?,1
Play out this one over of spin ab,3
Virat looking like KL light,4
29D move by Ashwin. Finishes 4 overs. And goes out to be substituted by a better fielder,7
I don't want RCB in qualifier 1 coz I am scared of ABD. DC please,2
Is Padikkal tired?,2
Is Kohli the worst when compared Price to Performance this IPL?,1
"I feel like this happens every single RCB innings. Padikkal gets a good start, then him and Kohli bat way too slow in the middle. They create pressure for themselves. Kohli gets out playing an aggressive shot. Then they rely on ABD to save the innings. Rinse. Repeat.",6
[deleted],3
Kohli should just retire from t20.,-1
"Dare I say, this is probably better than getting him out early.",2
AB seems nervous,2
"Cometh the hour, disappears the captain Koach!",4
Good spell by Ashwin.. love this man,2
Fuck it I'm supporting Mumbai now,2
"Don't worry RCB, DC will play more slowly then you're playing right now, for reference you can watch last DC game.",3
"Holy fucking shit I'm out , can't watch RCB wtffff 😡",6
"So, No Mankad this match",3
Pls just pass the strike to Paddu,1
I have a feeling ABD might get out in this over,2
First time for everything am I right Ashwin?,2
lol imagine having Gurkeerat in this situation.,1
"_RCB batting first_

Disappointment: Let me introduce myself",4
"Nah swanny, you're just jizzing because you called a wicket alert.",3
Not a good time for our only leg spinner to end his spell,2
Where's the mute button on Pant?,6
Axar best allrounder from Gujarat if he gets AB,4
"Thanks, Ashwin. An ethical lesson like this is exactly what I needed before NNN",6
85 runs in 80 balls with only 2 wickets down. Not a good look so far.,3
Iyer please bat well tonight please,2
So awkward watching pant keep with half sleeves,2
Who will play >130SR for team India.,3
Pant : ooooohaooooKgoooo,4
"- Kohli in meaningless friendly matches where he can pad his stats: Legend

- Kohli in must-win matches, especially at ODI tournaments: Dumpster fire",7
DDP really HAS to start accelerating considering he’s the set batsmen right now,6
With ABD in next I don't mind if we had dropped Kohli again.,3
At least Kohli seems to have realized that it is better to get out for a quick or average 30 than score 70 at a strike rate of 120.,5
Ffs Kohli play well im Australia.,1
Lol stfu swanny. Some stupid excuse.,2
Taking a 💩 rn. Hearing Pant scream in the other room constantly making me feel like I am missing all the action,3
Face _and_ beard wash? How did men clean their beards before that!?,2
Looks like Shreyas improved in field placement,4
This overdependence on ABD is the same reason why RCB doesn't deserve a playoff spot.,5
DDP building his resume for the next Full Auction...,2
Is pitch prepared by Dhoni?,8
If you use Reddit Avatar your opinion isn't valid 🙄,2
RCB middle order (Except AB) is so inconsistent,6
"Paddikal: virat is out don't have to run hard.
Sees ab walking
*sad devdutt noises*",60
Do we know how many dot balls padikkal has played?,1
Ashwin is based,2
"Paddikal has no raw strength, does he?",2
Groundhog day starring Virat Kohli,1
They are just setting up a platform for close game.,1
"Did he say ""behenchod"" lol?",8
Delhi fielding is very comical,4
RCB makes every pitch look like its a bowling paradise,13
Who is that fielder lol?,11
"Did I just hear ""Aree yaar behenchod""?",10
Need powerful hitter or who can hit in gaps in middle order for rcb..eating too many balls and not piercing gaps,3
I know this is a thanks tubbs type of comment but only ABD is standing between RCB's victory and defeat.,7
"Delhi shouldn’t get too complacent here, AB is more destructive than Kohli",3
"If they played Moeen over Udana, you'd have that player that could realistically get you 30 off the last 2 overs.

But he's been inconsistent these days, so can't blame them for not picking it.",0
The level of cricket has been really low so far. Especially from RCB.,3
83 average between 11-15 WTF,8
Anyone else feel recent IPL games have been boring?,5
lmao Ponting cam is as entertaining as Kohli cam.,10
SHAW!!,3
Lol why did he look so happy while chasing that ball,4
Looks like prithvi worked on his fielding a bit,11
"On an unrelated note, Dhawan is insanely fit. Dare I say as fit as Kohli, fitness plays a huge role in avoiding injuries. Dhawan has been relatively injury free except when sustained in the game itself",12
Effort of the career by shaw,36
Shaw fielding is good today 🤬,12
It's time for padikkal to hit the gym before next ipl.,7
[deleted],-10
Fielding on point DC today.,4
Arre yaar behnchod,2
Runs ka akaaal,3
Shaw diving wtf 😂,11
Wow. First time I saw Shaw dive and save runs,12
I hope ABD doesn't force me to masturbate tonight ☺️,8
"Compare this to Mumbai or SRH where the openers go hard. KKR try to post 180 everytime, doesn't work but at least they try to shot for it.",7
Haha even Shaw is fielding today,2
"Everytime ABD plays a shot now, my heart just skips a beat.",10
Shaw showing intent in fielding there. Ponting's spanking sessions have worked.,8
Whatever you do get ABD out,2
Ok what should RCB need to make sure they have a higher NRR than KKR?,2
AXE AND ASH!! Awesome bowling spells...,6
Is the pitch on the slower side or RCB?,3
Fuck it's so frustrating to see every single fucking shot go straight to the fielder man,11
Good spell Axar,1
Now here's the fucking problem. Kohli padikkal and the baby get rcb in such a precarious position and expect abd to play a crazy innings. It's not right.,1
Please get to 160+,1
What a find Padikkal has been for RCB..,7
"Gill and DDP seem to have the same problem of acceleration.

While Shaw has the opposite problem of being patient.",7
Does Koach know he's been playing like shit,5
Paddikal with the intent but no timing. Trying his best though,5
I like how optimistic comments are here thinking DC can chase 160 or 170,3
If there's no ABD special. RCB is gonna shit in the bed again.,3
"Thankfully, Delhi is out of spin.",8
What's the fucking point of mgmt if they can't ask Padikkal to play for team rather than himself,8
"DDP too tired to hit big, he'll get out soon",2
"Kohli, the best batsman in the world,only scored 460 runs at 122 SR so far in the tournament. Even KL Rahul, who gets all the shit, for his slow batting scored 670 runs at 129 SR. Agreed RCB's batting is wafer thin but this level of cautiousness is not justified in T20 cricket. Its not like they have amazing bowling to make up for below average totals.",11
"The stuff Graeme Swann says gets away with. Calling Stoinis a heavy loader, lol.",5
Kohli should grow muscles or he should retire from t20s,6
Anything above 130 is enough for DC. RCB know it very well.,3
"Snsidsjskzjxbsalzksnwaksixnss

I always wanted to do that",5
Only 6 overs left and we haven't crossed 100 yet.,6
I find it hilarious how many people believe that you can overnight become a better fielder by working on your field for a couple of days,5
In 84 balls there have been 7 fours and 1 six. This is abysmal,6
Only AB de Villiers special can save us.... Please hope for it guys,6
They should atleast get a total that they can defend under 17 overs.,3
Pant lol,5
"Kohli's dismissal was slightly Padikkal's fault as well - he was the one who should have been hitting out, and his reticence put pressure on Kohli.

Something Thala knows all about, given he has a PhD in it.",21
[deleted],35
Is the pitch good or nah?,1
Pant at it again,5
"Do any of y'all personally know any of the Josh ad directors?
I want the stuff they are on.",8
I'mma have dinner I'm scared,7
Pant ki awazz.... agla indian idol,8
"What a disasterous campaign from Kohli. Release him next year and replace him with Parthiv. He should be our wicketkeeper, captain, leader, legend.",6
"Just like the last 3-4 matches, I have no clue if the pitch is slow or if our batting is absolutely shit..",3
Fuck yeah Pant !! Stress those vocal cords man,5
This is why Parthiv was so much better he would provide quick starts and keep behind the wickets,4
DDP cant play shit outside pp,6
We don't deserve to be in playoffs. There I said it,7
"So, can they target Sams?",2
"Guys, they do know that this is a must win match, right?",2
At this point 140 is a good score for RCB. Anything else is a bonus.,2
PP opened the innings at a strike rate of around 140 in the last two seasons for RCB and almost always gave them a good powerplay.,2
Which is the better way to go in t20s? Horses for courses or stick with winning combination?,1
Lmao Kohli gets out and the squealing behind the stumps resumes,9
RCB again sauntering to 120 here,2
"Kohli: *Tries to score runs*

AB: I will take care of it, you go make Dream 11 team",8
Daniel Sams knows a bit of AB having played against him in BBL,1
Abd do something na,2
"After Kohli's wicket, a lot of pressure been relieved for Pant",8
lol I am going to miss Pant in Australian LOI,3
It looks like CSK and RCB swapped batting,3
"DDP in PP: Yuvraj

DDP after PP: Thala",22
Removing the 5th bowler who was leaking runs makes DC so much better. Now they need the opener issue sorted,6
DC will win today,4
"Someone should ask Kohli, Where is your fucking intent?",1
Who's that fielder lol,1
RCB is losing this .....you heard it first 🙃,3
Bruh wtf is Padikkal doing?,3
"That is what Sams is known for, excellent",2
Sams can bat also right?,3
RCB's win is directly proportional to De Villiers scoring 50+ runs.,11
"Wohoo 
Who is shitter let's find out in the next 3 hours .",5
Ddp is as criminal as Kohli in this innings,6
Is the pitch playing badly? Why are RCB playing so slow yaar?,5
"Very surprising that young Indian players are not great players of spin. Since this comparison came in, Yuvi even at 20 was killing spinners iirc as compared to Dev who's strike rate drops down as soon as powerplay is over and when spinners come in",5
Is Sams debuting today?,1
Has Hostar crashed for anyone else?,1
Who did lalit yadav come in place of,1
Feel like shit where's Deshpande,3
Pant is 10X more irritating behind the stumps than the fake crowd noise.,2
"great, even 150 lookin far now 🙄",3
I wonder what's Virat's SR if you exclude that 90 run innings,12
Baseball bunt by ddp,3
Has Hostar crashed for anyone else?,1
"Saying Phillipe was (partially) at fault today, would be accurate right?",7
"RCB have a fundamental issue of their lower order batting, it has been masked so far by the openers and ABD and one brilliant Kohli innings but these last 3-4 games are showing it, and perhaps why Kohli is playing more conservatively. RCB don’t have a Russel/Pandya/Pollard/Jadeja",7
Need Chris moris after this.,2
DDP paying tribute to Thala,6
"Padikkal mate, you gotta start flying the ball",9
Ffs even abd is playing tuk tuk now,4
Fuck! I am gonna lose my 30 coins today. Thanks RCB.,8
Stop it Padikkal is already dead,6
Is Krunal the fastest “spinner”? He sometimes crosses 115 km/h. Haven’t seen speeds like that since Afridi.,6
Fuck that Philippe,1
pitch isn't that fast,3
Kohli should learn intent from Sky rather than sledging him,6
How is Sam's bowling better than nortje. I've never heard of him.,5
No intent from padikkal,5
"DC can't chase 150+ with this lineup, hell they can't chase anything with their current batting form",4
DDP start hitting man,3
At least hit Sams :(,2
[deleted],-7
Any signs of Dew yet?,2
"assuming DC chase at 10 rpo, 160 should be the target.",2
Yeah padikkal has to go now.,3
"Should’ve at least given Parthiv one chance, gotta feel for him",7
Just get to 160 and let them win in 18.3 overs,6
Nothing better than eating spoonful of ghee and watching test match in IPL ☺️,3
"Fuck it, padikkal should just blindly go for it",6
Wtf is this runrate??,7
I'm still nervous. We'd somehow allow them 170,5
"K guys it's 8:30 IST I gtg go back to studies :(

Would comeback in 2hrs (hopefully)",4
Lads we need to get a move on,1
Good guy RCB making sure they score low so even if DC fucks up they lose by a small margin and stays alive,4
"Hetmyer for Sams was a smart move, now they don’t have a weak link to target.",3
Good god DC will chase in 7th over let alone 17th,7
Not giving much room to the rcb batsman. They will have to hit through the line and with power.,3
For a first season Paddikal has done really well. Need to work on his Range hitting like Samson has done but please don't become inconsistent like him. We've got future opener on our hands 😃,5
DhobiDhobi Padikkal,4
KL and Koach suffering from the exact same syndrome.,6
"At this rate, RCB doesn't deserve a place in the playoffs.",7
This reminds me of CSK in the first few matches. Thank fuck we got Gaikwad in.,6
This wicket looks really hard to bat on. DC can't bat on anything that isn't a road.,7
Does RCB expect to defend a 160-ish score even with the dew factor playing its part??,5
Im a RCB supporter but they just don't deserve to reach playoffs with this kind of play..,4
Carey should have been playing instead of sams.,0
Padikkal gonna get out soon,3
Is Sams always this high?,5
Ddp gets way too tired by this point,5
"Did no one else catch that on the stump mic? Pant had a go at AB, ""it's not easy to do this everytime"" (referring to AB blasting it) and AB replied ""it's never easy"" and Pant was like, ""yeah, never easy"". LMAO",94
Harsha has been a bit too condescending this year. 2020 is taking a toll on him.,5
"If i had a body like Stoinis, i'd wear nothing but a Conan the barbarian style vest and use a club for batting.",11
Good umpiring. That was wide.,5
Opposition only needs Abd wicket as Kohli forgot T20 batting. RCB=ABD,7
This DC bowling line up is looking really good now after Sams inclusion,2
"Understand the approach because of a lack of batting after AB, but trust the lower order to score some runs. Right now if De villiers and Paddikal get out, the game is gone.",5
"God I hope rcb can't reach 140,dc is playing extremely badly in the last games,even that is like 180 for us",4
CSK easily chased down 153 in this stadium a few days ago.....given RCB bowling attack they might need at least 180,2
"Sams:*bowls a wide*

Sanjay: ""excellent skills from the bowler""",2
"That's a wide, come on.",1
"why doesnt kohli sweeps to spin bowling?
he always goes the air route?",2
20 more of those please,3
Delhi show some mercy pls,3
"13 years same middle overs bullshit fuck this shit man, please dissolve this franchise for our mental healths",7
 SR of Padikkal tho,2
"""Driving a Ferrari with the handbrake on"" what a brilliant analogy for Test20 batting",30
Wtf was hetmeyer dropped ?,3
I get the feeling that DC will chase comfortably before 17.3 overs unless RCB play 5 over 80-90 runs,3
"Grow some muscles Kohli, fuck that vegan food",19
Please give us more wides,4
Kohli's eyes have stayed the same way since his dismissal lol. Wide open,8
"There you go fans, the short run",2
Nortje and Rabada have 4 overs. This is terrible,5
Fucking Finally,2
Snoozefest,2
Unlucky,1
Blood boils when I see Pant in these SR stats,5
"Need to take risks, tf are you saving wickets for?",1
Get ur 50 and score already,3
"Sad RCB fans,

150 looks like a par here. and for once, Kohli seems to have got the selection right with 3 spinners, so relax. Some ABD magic can get them to 160-odd.",18
Sams looks like he has an extra chromosome,7
"Unless AB does a madness, RCB will have a really below par score.",17
Chacha ji bought the umpires,0
"Bro that spin, axar also doesnt produces",10
Blind umpires. It went under the bat,0
"All right youngling, it’s your time to shine",8
Sams bowls like a Trex,8
"I'd like question the ethics of Ashwin, who walks off the field after bowling his quota",22
Please padikkal keep hitting,4
Padikkal better turn into a Tewatia now. What a fucking waste of balls,3
This is so laughable and shambolic for RCB to score 6 runs per over. Disgraceful,8
8 wickets left. Hell for leather boys.,2
DDP has been the shining light for us this season,4
Paddikal never has an accelerated inning...the guy's hack lol...,3
5 overs = 75 runs? Fingers crossed,9
Of course vegan kohli is failing in uae.,13
I feel like there was a nick on the 2nd wide,3
"Okay say in a perfect scenario, we have 3 games left. Its not ridiculous to expect abd and kohli to fire in 3 games right ?",7
Well played DDP✨,3
Another 50 for padikkal,7
"Well played Padikkal, quite mature as usual..",5
60 of next 5 pleaaaase,7
"Unpopular opinion: Finch should have played.

He is experienced international player with class, and can score big on his day.",10
"If Paddikal can do that for a few more overs, AB can go 40+ in last three overs",8
Please keep rcb under 140 somehow. DC can't chase more than 120/130,7
"You have your 50 now, make it rain 6s please :(",32
"After RCB lose a match: It's a just game of cricket played by people I've never met in my life. I shouldn't be bothered by this.

Me during the match: _Just fucking swing the bat you donkey_",160
5 overs with Nortje and Rabada fuck my life,8
"5 fiftys in first IPL. Disregarding the SR, that's incredible",7
"AB : So Kohli you play some other games?

K: Yeah I'm into speedrunning.

AB : really? What Mario? Zelda? Portal?

K : uhhh... *flashbacks of 2s*",7
If they some how make it to play offs kohli should open the batting and play till the last over.,3
Can RCBs eventual loss today be attributed to paddikal s loss of fire power after the power play?,3
Lol at the commentator saying that Paddycal needs to stay till the end,2
5 overs 80 runs pleeeeaaaase,3
"RCB guys, now that we know we are shiz and probably not going thru - whom should we support now? SRH - The only South Indian Team left? KKR bocs SRK/Eoin Morgan? DC bcos of Punter/younglings? OR MI - Coz they will anyway win it?",-1
"Padikkal has been the Best Player for RCB this season.

Followed By Chahal, De Villiers and Morris.",2
Give Padikkal some red bull so he score. Man this is just annoying,4

I felt quite old when I got to know that DDP is younger than me by a month.,11
Just get to 170 somehow please..,2
Anything above 140 should be good enough for RCB. DC won't risk playing hard to get to it within around 17.3.,6
"I can't even shit on DDP, in a team that can't bat below AB, atleast he got them something",11
They will score at least 160 and we will crumble for 120 odds.,4
"Batsman finally gets going

Rcb: we'll have a time-out thx",6
We need 80 in the last 5 PLEASE,8
Abd in the last 5 overs. 80 runs at least. 190 to chase then,1

Quite a snoozefest so far.",2

Padikkal is one of RCB’s best players this season,12
IN B4 20/6 IN NEXT 3 OVERS,6
Just get ABD out DC & this is your match,2
With dew in 2nd innings how can they expect to defend such low totals. It's just shows that don't play according to the conditions.,3
Paschim pathak sama 😳😍,2
Hope the law of averages hit virat in IPL and he is back to his usual best in Aus,7
Time for DDP to go hard at the boundaries,6
RCB game and only 1 six. Am I dreaming?,6
Can't believe this guy used to be the no1 t20i batsman for more than 2 yrs,4

Only uf we could rent MI lower order for a day.. we'd be able to make use of these last four overs,1

Ufff koach appearing in ads just after he gets out pisses TF outta me,2
"For someone playing in his first ever tournament, Padikkal has done brilliantly by scoring over 450 runs. It is unfair to criticize him for lack of intent considering that they don't have the likes of Russell, Pandya and Pollard in their middle order. If someone needs to up the tempo, it should have been the senior player i.e Kohli.",10

"FOR HATERS : 

Hell, yes. Aggression without cheating - everything Ponting wished to be but could never emulate to the same level.

Telling the world to fuck off and FOLLOWING it up with fuckoffesque performances - that's some alpha shit right there. Takes balls because if you fall flat, you become Umar Akmal (lmao). Kohli has revitalised bragging about big dicks and then actually having a 13-incher - and that's a good recipe for fun times (no homo... I think?)

He's a spicee boii, is that Viral Kilo",6
Ash hide n seek...,3
"Do you think one of Ponting/Simons will do a ""Rahul Dravid cap throw"" at the end",7
The 3 spinners could be a bonus to RCB.. Along with Morris so 160 seems like a par score considering all of dc top order is out of form,3
If these 2 stay at the crease the score could get quite high.,2
This DevD guy should start thinking about accelerating now atleast,1
Why doesn't Ross Taylor play in IPL?,7
This is what happens when no one can question you as a leader because of the sheer power accumulation.,1

No long off? Why?,2
Only with Kohli you feel 400+ runs season underpar. As I said at start of tournament not playing 2018 UAE Asia cup Kohli need to get used to pace and bounce of these pitches. Meanwhile ABD has already played on these grounds,2

Nortje should sign a kolpak deal,1
"No offense, but this wicket is a blessing in disguise for RCB",5

finally RCB would get a boost now....,1

It's not a really good innings lol it's another innings which hurts the side. A good innings is what DDP played vs MI.,6
DDP seems to be playing only for 50s,5
"Well played tbh, he'll learn he is just 20 years old",9
"I love how Nortje still bowls fast despite getting hit, slower ball, naah bitch watch me bowl even faster.",4
"finally, he got out thank god",3
Same dismissal many times.. DDP,5
send dubey.,1
Is DC bowling really well or the pitch is a bit on the slower side?,1
Padikkal needs to work on his stamina. Perhaps it's because it's uae ?,2
Padikkal has got consistency. Now he just needs to work on his stamina and big hitting and he is playing for the NT in 2 years.,5
Ddp doesn't hit boundaries after powerplay,2
bro that was a sexy delivery,2
Good luck getting 40+ in last 4 overs with Nokia and Rabada rushing in at 150+,2
I swear Padikkal gets out to the same ball every time,2
Dube show gurkeerat how it’s done today,3
Timber....,1
How many times has DDP tried to make room and play a stroke and gotten bowled... Just feels like he throws away his wicket once he feels he can't hit it..,3
He will make a good ODI player if he works on his fitness,1
Time for pinch hitter Dube,1
Knock Knock Nortje,1
Arrey Paddikal ko kyu out kiya! Sahi khel raha tha.,3
Why does everyone around me want to watch RCB and virat lose ?,3
DC please be nice and chase the total in 17 overs or lose by more than 25 runs,2
Ohhh i think i just saw dube stopped and morris sent in. Dube looked super pissed did i read that right?,1
Morris before Dube???,1
 padikkal departs afte making an ideal t20 knock 50(41),2
Gone too late,2

damn that was bullet straight. absolute deathrattlepron,3
"**15.4** Nortje to Padikkal, OUT, **knocks middle stump.** **112-3**

D Padikkal  b Nortje 50 (41b 5x4 0x6) SR: 121.95",2
This type of innings from DDP 50 at SR of 125 works only when others are playing at 150+ Strike rate,4
why has ab stopped playing his ramps and reverse sweeps? 2012-15 ab was something else,4
Damn that delivery was at 153 kmph,2
Paddikal really needs to work on his stamina. He just loses his breath by over 9 and stumps soon after.,4
RCB is suffering due to Kohli’s form,3
Rcb should send in Morris tbh,2
This is our problem isnt it? No pinch hitters,2
Paddikal often gets out bowled. Doesn't he,5
Padikkal should get the selfish player of the year award. What a shitshow he is with this ODI fifties,-2
"Padikkal scores about half the RCB’ score right now  
RCB fans: FUCK YOU",9
how many times has ddp got out the same way lmao,2

Morris lost his batting form years ago why the fuck man,2
That's nortje for you bitches,2

"aw man, how do RCB fans handle so much disappointment and pain",9
Wtf lmao,1
Hopelessness on Kohli's face at the end of every season,13
It's ok Morris atleast you tried and didn't wasted much deliveries,8
"Tmkc yrr,",1
"Relax, it's Morris not abd.",3
Morris is even more overpriced than Unadkat. Exactly the reason DC released him.,9
Looking bad for RCB at the moment unless 2012 ABD comes back,5
DC Morris turning up again,4
Kohli is about to cry,9
This is not what RCB would’ve expected? This is exactly what I expected 😂,6
He threw his wicket wtf,2
"The point of criticism for Kohli is not that he isn't playing insane innings. I don't expect him to make 70(30) every second game, or ever, if he does insist on trying to bat through the innings every game.

But if you take out the 90(52) and 72(53) (which I take out because the 90 is clearly an outlier for this season, and the 72 which was fine because it was a low chase), he has scored 298 runs in 272 balls this season. That is horrendous.

We don't want him to play superhuman innings, just half decent ones from time to time.",14
No please no,3
"Paddikal bailed the fuck out of this RCB team. This match is still winnable because he was able to last so long.

Big kudos DDP. Good knock.",10

How did we win any match with this shit batting?,8
RCB or DC let's not kid ourselves. MI is going to win anyways so this match doesn't really matter.,6
Morris could have taken more time,2
Come on Dube make your name boy!!,3
HOLY SHIT CHINTU IN DC CROWD,5
Are we going to see Nortje bowling with Archer soon when England snatch Nortje?,5
Nortje ignoring rahane is the best moment,2
Lord Dube to do it for RCB.,0
Rcb 125-8,2
Dube pls hit the ball,1
CMV: last 5 days of matches has been really boooooooring,1
Familiar RCB so far,6
Hit some bootleg yuvi,2
"Rabada to Dube. 

Finally a fair battle.",3
This dube is so fucking inflexible,2
Go towards the ball Dube wtf,6
"Abd,abd,abd",3
it's crazy how such a bang average cricketer like morris gets in ahead of a mercurial talent like mo,11
"*run from it,hide from it, dubeji still arrives*",5
Yes rabada make him waste 3-4 balls,2
"RCB don't feel sad just yet. In Delhi, there are many beds that have been shit on. Delhi Belly, you know how it is.",3
"Feet stuck in concrete

LMAO",10
The score is already out of our reach lol,2
No expectations from anyone else other than ABD,4
Wtf is this,7
"Kohli at toss, ""we need more firepower at end, so Dube in place of Gurkeerat""",10

Chewtiya RCB,6
Please MI play full squad,9
Self destruct mode on,11
We have a 2020 upgrade for ABD vs Steyn. ABD vs Rabada in the death is as exciting as it gets.,18
RCB deserve this for having their tail start at 5,19
Our firepower trying to nick one,7
If they can’t hit just fkin turn the strike over and give Ab a chance to demolish the bowling,7
Dube has cinderblocks for feet,10

Petition to rename RCB to Tuk Tuk Gang,13
lmfao 140 tops,6
Feet struck in Concrete.. lol .,5
To those guys who say Rabada's wickets in the death are overrated. Tell me are dots in death overrated too? Read that again slowly now,6
This is what happens when you play with 7 bowlers.,5
Some altercation during the time out..ponting vs Kohli,6
AB should just farm the strike. Everyone remaining would just slow down the momentum,2
"finish em rabada, jof is coming for your crown",1
AB is being starved of strike. very likely he's gonna hole out soon.,3
"Match referee, please deduct Padikkals score from RCB as it is played for personal 50 and not for team

 - rcb fans",9
Ive never seen a finisher so scared of a bowler. This guys body just completely shuts down when rabada comes in to bowl,6

The Sunday bored us enough..

PS: Let SRH qualify tomorrow too dear God",2
"Isuru Udana broke into the scene with the bat against the Saffers. Could've given him the hail mary. Dube doesn't go from ball 1, added pressure on ABD.",6
Loser of this match is hoping MI doesn't rest players and/or somehow still beats SRH.,3
Looks like KKR has to wait for MIs grace,2
Dube and Rabada Lordy lord,3
"People saying Koach should be dropped as captain of RCB and India, he's an untouchable force ATM. Bigger than game dare I say. And he doesn't strike like someone who would play under someone who's junior to him. Not everyone is dravid or Sachin tbh. He's not going anywhere until he's retiring",9
"ABD should be in another team , I hope RCB gets brain dead and release him mistakenly this year",11
Wew,0
Dube or Shankar?,4
Dube already shat his pants twice. He can't handle pace.,12

Parthiv patel died for all these shitty starts. He used to always give us a quick start.,7
"I appreciate that anything can happen on any particular day, but even if RCB makes through to the playoffs, do they even have a realistic chance of winning the title?  With the exception of ABdV, they look clueless.",3
Man this'll be a hard enough score for DC to chase,1
We have to rely on AB **again**. How many times will our team put him in this position?,8
Their main batsman is still there tbh,5
Is the pitch difficult to bat on or are RCB just shitting the bed?,4
"Surely Finch comes back for Philippe next match? He is a proven match winner and can come out good any match.

"I wanted to say ""Two South Africans at the crease in a pressure situation, what could possibly go wrong?"" but they didn't last long enough. 

Happy because Delhi, but painful as a South African xD",19
KKR bois its all in MI's hands now. The team who always fucks us up.,5
5 runs in the death,6
Yes AB farm the strike everyone else is Tailender,9
RCB fans must have the bluest balls ever,9
What's the sense of picking all rounders who can neither bat nor bowl?,13
now a DC collapse will be good news. 2020 is finally over & we are back to normal,8

"I want both the teams in top 4, how this is possible? If SRH looses tomorrow right?",7
What were rcb thinking during the auction when it was time to buy a couple good finishers,6
"Myth of cricket: Batters get used to Bowlers by facing them more. 


We've seen Cummins getting Smith Twice.



Williamson getting out to Boult and Ferguson.



Kohli getting out to Bumrah and Ashwin.",9
They will get 150 if abd plays till the end.,3
Chasing 150 in 17.1 overs is gonna be hard :(,3
This IPL is either gonna be another turn around in kohli's career or it will be remembered as the start of kohli's downfall,6
DC please take it slow and do it in 18 overs,2
I'd be surprised if they get over 150.,5
Please AB,6
It seems like RCB has more representation than DC,3
140+ would be nice,1
Shit we want RCB to get to 160.,1
"Why?

I have no idea why I support this cursed bullshit team. I've never lived in Bengaluru. I don't have any family from there. Hell, I think they should be charged in a criminal court for the way they make sambar and dosai for fucks sake.

And yet, I support these losers. Sure, they could win today, but so what - they'll obviously lose to MI in the qualifier and then promptly lose again in the whatever they call it game.

God.",7

Want Delhi to chase this all guns blazing but I don't think the batting line-up is in form to do that.,2
Sam's gonna be expensive,2
"RCB has so many fallback options


1. Win the match- get top 2 

2. Else Lose but with small margin - get top 4

3. Else lose by big margin - hope SRH loses.",6
RCB needs to bowl out of their minds to defend. They have like 7 batsmen to RCB's 4.,5
RCB should change their name to ODI,3
In last 2 overs ABD should deny singles like Morgan. Dube is shit,4
Let's go AB,3
This is a big big over,2
Sams is a blunder imo,1
RCB needs to snag Raina next year if he is in the pool. Too much pressure on AB and there is no finisher other than him.,4

The dude deserves at least one IPL trophy before he retires.",3
"Also for all the complaining about RCB's middle order, it's weird that no credence is given to the idea that Kohli comes in, bats for 10 overs, gets 30(30), gets out, and then basically says ""All right now score 80 runs in 5 overs"". Maybe Morris, Sundar et al would do a bit better if their top order left them a base to accelerate from instead of a ditch to dig themselves out of?",8
"Get the field placed good, like it has been in the match",1

This is such noob captaincy. Why would you bowl Sams now !?!,3

Asking to be spanked. Daddy 😌😌😌😌,2
Bowl at 4th stump yaar. No wide or leg side bowling please,4
Abd gonna take Sams to the cleaners this over,4
I have a feeling ABD is gonna skin Sams alive,4
This might work like Pollard baited AB into gifting his wicket. Or end up like a Virat vs Morkel moment.,3
Game on!!!,4
Virat has been rubbish and I couldn’t be happier,1
I feel so sad for Archer and ABD,1
This guy replaced Hettie? What's the thought process behind that?,0
Gaikwad tongue out like abd. Gaikwad god confirmed.,3
150 incoming. Sams 25 run over.,3
"Iyer is too defensive. Should have bowled Rabada and Nortje first to try to get rid of ABD, instead of saving them for the last two and getting done with Sams early!",4
Sams is a variation specialist. He will get Unadkatted against ABD,2
dani daniels first ball... fucked over the head....,2
Wait what happened to Ash?,1
"Unless it was sub-130 (unlikely now), no way DC is scoring this in 17 overs if they even win. They will look to go for the simple win.",2
Rcb needs to play Moeen! Honestly their lower middle order is paper thin,3
We don’t deserve De Villiers.,5
AB do it one more time pls,2
"Another one sided game.

Except for the drama of qualifications, this last 2 weeks have been boring.",6
AB 50(25) incoming.,1
"AB you beautiful man, we don't deserve you!",5
"So RCB thinks a total of 140-150 is gonna be enough to win today's match.


Cool. See you guys next year.",10
RCB Peaked too early in the tournament. So not surprised with their performance in last 3 matches.,5
RCB needs  other team to beat some other team to qualify - Whoda thunk it would happen this way?!!!!,3
Dubey isn't running any twos lol. Slow as a fucking snail.,2
where's sammy?,1
I won't mind if AB refuses singles,2
Sams looks like his head is too small for his body,8
"What is this? Sams should have been given 20th over, it could work but at least try your best bowlers, I can sense a 15+ over",3

Dube anna please do some shit,0
"ABD is the key man (as always). He stays until 20th, RCB can hope for a decent total",2
You get RCBs top 4 out and it's game over for them. I don't see them winning let alone qualifying this year.,2
Lmao. The youngest player in the team is fielding at backward short leg. Everyone in DC knows that Shaw is a shit fielder,4
Dubey you useless fucklk.,5
Good stuff from Dubey,1

T: how moronic is Iyer exactly!",4
LORD DUBE!!!,4
dube and gurkeerat both equally incompetent,2
Told ya they'll reach 150.,4
Ok bois r/cricket bullied him enough finally,8
Guys don’t worry this match juuuust needs to be close for KKR or SRH to be knocked out.,7
"Dube best finisher all-rounder batsman bowler in the world






Admit it!",9
Yabba Daba Dubey,2
I take it back good shot Dube,1
RCB again playing without common sense. Atleast they should get a total which can prevent their NRR going below KKR.,1

It be hella funny if RCB don't make it,3
Dube single le sala,2
Just 2 more balls,2
Lol Bish schooling a Twitter troll,5

No single now dubey.,1
BBL top bowler is shit. Pass it on,3
Dube with a almighty slog.. connects with nothing but air,4
Biggest challenge in modern day cricket is focusing on cricket than watching yourself on the big screen,6
let’s go doobie boy,4
160 possible if Ab bats through,2
Sam's decided he needs to give RCB some help.,8
dube got shat on for playing one dot ball 😂😂😂,19
"If only we had dube during the last game, we would have been chilling during this game.",8
i guess RCB will score around 162-165 and Delhi will reach 140 or something.,6
LORD DUBE > GURCARROT,12
"Is there already so much dew that the ball is slipping out of the hand? Otherwise, what is the explanation behind that juicy full toss??",5
Okay we bullied him too much,4
sams chutiye,2
I don’t think DC can chase 140+ in 17 odd overs. So KKR should be out,5
What is the camera man doing.,7
RCB needs at least 160+ to pose some threat,6
Chutia sams getting schooled by Dubey of all people,6
Beginning to think Sams is not a major upgrade over Harshal,5
Big Brain move by Iyer to make the game interesting,8
Bbl hits lmao.,2
Shitty camerwork is back,3
Is it just telugu commentators or are other regional commentators also bad ?,4
Thank You Iyer for this Shitty over selection.. moron,8
Lord Sams,1
r/cricket in shambles,8
"Don't know about winning this, but I'm pretty sure DC is not chasing this in 18th over.",6
 So Ashwin won't come back on the field. India's strained hamstring tally is growing. Hopefully it is a precaution.,7
Uncle sam done fucked up.,3
Don't think DC will be able to chase 160+ score In 17.3 overs,3
And they drop him for the man lol,4
Delhi Chokers,3
Iyer's captaincy has been very shit sometimes this season.,7
Dc really stacked the bowling lol.,7
Shit camerawork has been a regular thing this season.,4

Dube mugging off r/cricket right now.,8
"If RCB gets to 150, this game is over.

Slim chance that DC will be able to chase that unless Dhawan dominates and drops an 80 burger. DC's batting is hot garbage.",4
absolutely garbage bowling from sams. utter shite.,2
This is the fire power koach was taking about.,7
160 incoming.,2

Just bowl wide off stump...,1
Alright Dube u turn tabler,3
Lol the camera man wasn’t expecting Dube to hit it.,6
Dube averages 49/24 with bat and ball respectively in FC cricket 😳,6
Fucking retire yourself Sams,0
Need this Dube to get into form to stabilize this middle-order. Will take some pressure off Kohli to tuk-tuk to oblivion.,2
This why we have won our matches despite Iyer. Like how does Sam bowl anything other than the 20th over here is just inexplicable.,2
Lord Dube is way better than GURCARROT,4
"I think 19th to Nortje, Rabada can control ABD",1
Sams bodied,1
Sams bowl mid 130s. He is as fast as Unadkat,3

DC ain't chasing within 17.3,2
you don't bowl a full toss to the GOAT.,2
Anything above 160 RCB has advantage.,1
Damn scriptwriters nerfing Rabada late in the season,3
"So, Ashwin completely his quota before getting injured, when did that happened? I missed it.",2

Dube would gain maximum respect if he smacks rabada for 2 sixes.,2

Buying a car is not an investment but an expense Bish,7
Dew already setting in. This is gonna be a mountain to climb for RCBs bowlers.,1
My prediction is 167,2
Even Dube is hitting him lol Rabada’s luck ran out today. No tail to clean up either.,4
"Shame on dube, my boi gurkeerat would have been 9(17)",13
Can't believe gurkeerat played instead of dubey lol. Utter comedy from koach.,8
This match is clearly the battle of the worst l. AbD is spanking yet team hasn't crossed 150 in the second last over. And the other team is allowing them score 50 plus in three overs.,5
SCARED RABADA,1
Rabada's economy compared to Jofra and Bumrah has been much much worse.,2
Dube shitting on r/cricket today,3
Nokias 150 balls are gonna go in the speed of light calling it,2
This match has been a show of who can choke harder at more critical points in the game,1
"""Gold shows value"" - Ian Bishop taking about car paint.

Okay.",5
ooh good stop Pant,2
Oh god now the frustration of dube when morris was sent in makes sense,2
SR above 160 on every length at the death. Bowl and pray is the only option for the bowlers,3
Dube>Gurkeerat. Still not ideal tho,9
"RCB game plan:

1. DDP get a 50 at least
2. Kohli tuk tuk to prevent a kohllapse 
3. AB comes in to whack as much as he can 
4. Chahal takes the important wickets",15
"No single now dubey, please no single.",1
"I hope Yuzi, Shahbaz, Washi hit that Ashwinesque economy rate today",1
Ranada has been a bit meh at the death for the Last few matches,1
Bowl Yorkers to Dube ffs,1
Not sure shivam dube ever imagined getting applauded by heavily pregnant Anushka Sharma..,6
Inb4 MI fields their B team and loses.,2
"ABD carries the game  
RCB: ez",1
Calling dibs. DC can't chase this,3
Dube is thinner and cheaper version of sehwag.,2
Identify six differences between Morgan and Dube. You can't.,5
This is still shit. 3 balls 4 runs,2
"Hey guys, is KKR chances became more slim? What needs to happen if kkr needs to qualify?",1
I still don't get why they replaced Dube with Gurkeerat,5
Sams bowled extremely well in PP. He gave away a lot in his last but cant discard his PP bowling,5
Gurkeerat would be 10 (17),19
Man Dube has to look for singles for those dots,4
160 is completely gettable and will be a defendable score against DC’s batting lineup that doesn’t seem to be in form.,6
[deleted],4
"Ugh I need to take a break, the stupid Altroz is looking ok in the right light",1
Dube screwing rabada without lube,6
11 off 19th over isn’t bad returns. Too many dots,6
"Is this why I’ve been rooting for you from the very beginning, KG? Ouch",1
"Benefits of Scoring 170+ Today.


1. Gives huge boost to RCB's confidence.

2. Respectable total to defend for the bowlers.

3. Koach won't have the option to say ""We were 15-20 runs short"" xD",21
ABD just needs to hit two sixes.....,3
 There was a team which used to win convincingly. It was CSK 2008-2019 :(,5
Hope they didn't cross. Please. Please.,1
Get ready with your calculators for some mid-game quick mafs,3
Well fuck,1
I want a 40 run over from RCB now.,2
2 dots and a four. cant expect more i guess,2
Do not take the single now pls,1
good knock though,3
Atleast better than Gurukeerat 17(11),6
Well played Dube,4
[deleted],4
"Apparently Tata sales are up 79% this month.

* Leave Altroz at a cricket stadium

* Swanny falls in love with it

* ???

* Stonks",8
3 dots and wicket great,2
Oh well,2
Dube did decent,7
Well de Villiers should just hog the strike for the next over,2
If AB gets us 25 of this over we are in with a shot,7
Ok thank you ok,4
Dube got 4(4) from Rabada,3
Nice cameo dube,11
Poor ball.... OHHH DUBEYYYYYY,4
"death taxes and Rabada taking 2 wickets in an ipl game. 

the certainties of life",14
"A little too late with that one, chief",1
Did they cross lol,5
Lucky wicket tbh. Terrible length still,17
Eh not a terrible over so it's okay,4
[deleted],14
AB vs Nortje will be hot,6
ABD needs to keep strike in the last over like Morgan did yesterday,4
Nortje. THIS IS MAKE OR BREAK OVER BC. 6 BEST BALLS NEEDED.,5
"off season, you can find Dube on urbanclap to drive your mosquitoes away",3
"i ain’t shitting on dube, he did his part compared to the rest of this innings. GGs",25
"Lol Dube 0 4 0 W

He's nothing more than a blind slogger. Some click, some don't. Limited array of shots and zero intelligence. Not blaming him, but RCB shouldn't rest their hopes on him like he's Hardik",9
ABD should have played more balls in the last two overs than he got to . Not good Dube,3
Now it all rests on ABD to get 160-170,4
Please tell me they didn't cross.,3
All he had to do was put AB on strike. Instead he scored 4 runs off  4 balls and got out,2
If dube can fix those dots with singles he’ll actually be a decent lower order batsman,11
"**18.6** Rabada to Dube, OUT, **finds deep midwicket.** Short and just outside off. There in his pulling arc, but he's got no elevation on it.Dips into Rahane's lap **145-5**

S Dube c Rahane b Rabada 17 (11b 2x4 1x6) SR: 154.54",3
"Good innings from Dube, I know Mann would’ve been 5(16)",6
"AB and smashing his countrymen for huge sixes... Seems like I have seen this before...
Steyn must be having flashbacks of his srh days",3
Good enough work by Dube,7
Sheet 160 was on they need at least that.,5
The chase will be tricky.... Will DC go for the kill? Or the win? Or just ensure they are close....,6
First time in years rcb bowling is strong and scary compared to its batting,4
Shivam Du Boi > Gurcarrot,4
ABD should not be playing below 3 in a t20,2
"Dc vs rcb 

Jaise loha lohe ko kat-ta hai waise chutiya hi chutiya ko marega na",4
Hanuman chalisa intensifies,5
"I know I might get a lot of flak for saying this. But, the way Shivam Dube swings the bat, I do not find any difference between his batting and that of Narine!

If this is India's next all-rounder, then we are in for some serious disappointment.",3
ABD out first ball,-2
[deleted],2
"I dont think RCB fans need to be concerned. Delhi batting is already pretty out of form and its even weaker today.

I dont think Delhi will be able to chase 150+ score.",2
"Imagine 25+ this over. Yes, time to choke",1
"This is going to be an extremely close game, we have an inhouse Jadhav in the side today",2
If ABD doesn’t go this ball 155+ is guaranteed. We can’t in any way chase that much.,1
Nokias over will be super crucial,2
"We are so not chasing this in 17 overs, if we're gonna be chasing it at all. RCB fans can rest easy.",5
"Terrible over there from Rabada, if it was ABD on strike, he would have dispatched him",4
Fuck Yes Nortje,3
"Padikkal should learn a lot... When a senior player is anchoring the innings at the other end, he should up the ante and go for big shots. If not, Pressure builds on the senior player and happens what happened today for VK...

&#x200B;

Edit: Not mine. From Cricbuzz.",2
Dube did his part. Better than Gurkeerat,3
Lucky,2
"Dube did better than Gurkeerat, that's enough for me",1
Cmon my man Nokia do your thing brother,5
How come ABD playing. They crossed.,2
Please keep this over under 15 Nokia,3
ABD will FINISH BIG,2
"So, max 30 runs then",3
CMON AB,3
not sure if that ball was good or a shit ball,3
How will we chase anything is beyond me,4
"So, a new variation. Slower full-toss. Looks very effective, because of the way it suddenly dips.",5
OUT,3
DEVILLIERS needs to stop giving up strike to plebs,2
That's out no need to go,2
OUT,2
Good Innings Dubeji. Thank you for putting us back in the game.,6
Shouldn't even have ran,3
Are thigh high full tosses the way to stop ABD ?,4
Stupid as fuck,5
Wtf y the hell did u run man,7
Oh fuck my life,8
That's out. That's nortje for you. Dilli se hain bhenchod.,4
Bye abd,3
Why the fuck AB,9
"Only Nortje's full toss can get away it, also Archer",3
Rahane what a fielder,4
That was not smart,8
Unnecessary really,8
Rip playoffs.,5
Yesssss,6
[deleted],18
Now that’s a Chris Jordan Runout,5
LMAOOOO,1
Ricky is so stoic. No expression on his face!,3
I like this,3
MI DC would be a mouth watering encounter though.,4
well fuck,2
Hahahahahaha wow.,1
Well that’s anticlimactic,9
ABD has graduated from the Jordan school of running between the wickets,13
Lololololol,2
LOL ABD out.... RCB 155.... close game...,4
A glimpse of hope emerges in the last over for us,9
AB gone looks like,3
Goner,4
Lets Goooo,6
The number of times players have not hit a full toss out of the park has been remarkable,7
"DC the last 3 matches:

- 110/9 vs MI (batted first)

- 131/19 vs SRH (chasing 220)

- 135/9 vs KKR (chasing 195)

They are not chasing 145+ in a critical match lmao. Unless RCB goes vintage RCB and chokes like crazy. They have this in the bag.",8
Fuck,2
AB TOOK THE CHRIS JORDAN ROUTE,17
God fucking damn it,2
Fuck,1
There was no fucking 2nd run,8
RCB having collective brainfart lmao,3
"Too much greed, ab. Too much greed.",5
There goes RCB's shot at 160,5
"Fuck off Iyer! Just fuck off!

Cost us 15 runs with bowling Sams in the 18th over!!",4
Saddest AbD innings.,7
"Poor ABD, had to carry this batting lineup. Would probably have made 120 without him",10
Should have not run only,1
Nice,1
Nortje re-redempsh. Sigh.,1
That was a Chris Jordan run,5
IS IT NOT OUT,1
No point to that. Sundar on strike wouldn’t have been a bad thing,3
He's done a Chris Jordan there,5
Did ab just do a Chris Jordan?,3
The South African in him panicked,3
That second run was DOA,2
Seriously.,1
We will be lucky to get 150,2
"Dot ball to deVilliers in final over

Thats some rare shit",3
should've just stayed at strike like morgan last match,3
That was just brain dead from ab,1
Guess we are getting 150,3
Ab de never says no to a run though. Almost never.,2
Good bye 160,3
That was always a single,2
The Key to winning would be to not dismiss Rahane,1
"As Brett Lee said, full tosses are the most underrated deliveries. Just gotta know how and when to bowl them.",2
Padikkal is a good batsman. But I guess he'll be better off in ODIs than t20,8
Shouldn't have run. 20 short now,6
Now who would choke worse in the second innings we shall see soon,4
Difference of 14 runs in the total now.,3
Gold from Anrich,3
Why did that even go to the third ump lmao,3
He should have just kept strike,4
Rahane has been low-key good on field.,2
Unnecessary,1
"Rcb..., finds a way",4
Clap him off assholes. Wtf.,1
Umpire sleeping or what ...needs review for this,5
"Ffs, that's bad",3
Dudeeeeeee...just dont run ffs...be morgan,5
Pls restrict them for below 150,4
Cmon finish them under 150,3
Abe iss bsdk cheetar teeter ko nikalo saala nanga,7
RCB bowlers need to pull of the performance of a lifetime tonight,1
Meme mode: ✅,5
No Umesh here for 4 x 6,2
Well short even with a wide throw. Should have turned down the single like Morgan did yesterday.,2
bye playoffs,1
He's miles away,2
That is the shortest path in Jordanian space,3
Can Udana hit?,3
"If DC restricts them to 150, they can fuck Koach's bowling attack....",3
"Alexa play "" everybody hurts""",5
At the end of the day Kohli has to open and ABD has to come at 3 to face more balls.,4
"Udana is no muck, he can smash the ball a bit",3
"**19.2** Nortje to de Villiers, 1 run, OUT,  **146-6**

AB de Villiers run out (Rahane/&dagger;Pant) 35 (21b 1x4 2x6) SR: 166.66",2
The score is already 20 above what we can get lol,5
WTF Iyer,2
Valuable runs,2
Ooooh,2
Iyer you useless fuck 😂,4
Abe iyer chutia hai kya,4
"Barring a top order choke, I think we got this. Maybe not in 17 but we got this.",3
Iyer🤡,3
The fuck was Iyer doing there?,4
My boy Udana about to launch.,5
Iyer you fuckn Moron.. what a dumbfuck,5
Wtf iyer,3
RCB 10-12 runs ahead of what Delhi had in mind.,6
LORD UDNANA!!!,6
Iyer just looking at it WTF?!,7
Free runs lol we will take it,6
Did he lose the ball in the light?,4
Fucking run on the pitch get fucking fined dude but why run like that lol,2
Kick Shreyas pls. He sus,13
Bhenchod why is the midoff up,4
Wtf iyer,5
Nice one Iyer,9
AAEEEE IYERRRR,3
I would never understand captains keeping mid on and off up at the death. Like why?,3
So this dude in shower telling me to install an app peak 2020,5
Inb4 Koach would say we were 15-20 runs short in the end,3
"I think even  delhi will first try to be safe than go for the win , so rcb and dc shd be through with one of either kkr or SRH joining Mumbai",2
HUGE BOUNDARY. Fly boy!!!! UDANA,4
What was that lmao.,9
Should have ran the short run..1 run and strike as well,2
What was Iyer doing?,6
Who put shreyas at mid off?? .... Oh wait,8
Lmao,6
Iyer has lost it,5
The great Harsha bhogle- it might not be only abd who’s short today it looks like rcb is short too,4
Great presence of mind shown by the fielder by throwing it to keeper's end,3
UdAnna 🙏,2
We have 150 bois,3
"Wtf, why did padikkal and Kohli play odi innings? Difficult pitch to bat on?",5
Lol thanks iyer,4
Absolutely no pressure on DC to chase 150+. Can't believe we shit the bed again..,11
iyer brain fart,10
Iyer playing like cricket 07 fielder,14
When Udana can hit better than Gurkeerat,7
"Okay whew, we have 150 to defend in 18 odd overs",2
Iyer is just killing us at the moment. Unbelievably shit in the field.,2
Jesus Mumbai fans here do not like RCB. But I think hate would be a better word.,49
RCB should play Parthiv instead of Padikkal,-19
Iyer WTF!!,13
Iyre and cricinfo both screwed it completely,4
I love Nortje,3
"Yes Udana my boy, 3 more of these please.",7
Iyer giveth Iyer taketh,22
C O L L A P S E,3
[deleted],9
"RCB making sure they score just the right amount of runs that will not be chased within 17 overs or which will give them a win by less than 20 runs 

200 IQ from Virat",15
Gold over from Norjte here,6
I will say it once again Nortje has been our best bowler this season,4
Iyer you useful fuck,2
lol rcb never fails to disappoint me,4
Tactical MISFIELD?,8
What was Iyer doing lmao,3
Better late than never,4
This is so RCB it hurts,20
"This is why you don't leave the most explosive batsman of all time on the fucking bench till the fucking 12th over, you fucking morons.

He'll get antsy, and take stupid risks.",17
Could have avoided that four earlier,6
If we can't score 45- 50 runs in last 4. We don't deserve playoffs,13
"If RCB get 160, then how many overs must DC chase down the score to push them out of the top 4?",4
Fastest redemption ever for Iyer,10
Kohli should open and AB can play 1 down,9
TaiL sTaRtS aT 4 GuYs,3
RCB has enough to delay DC upto 17.3 overs,3
"Don’t RCB players ever learn?! After a few wickets, running is better than these blind shots",1
Remember. No Saini.,3
Lets be honest rcb doesn’t deserve to be in the playoffs,4
Iyer proving again and again with poor field placements. This extra boundaries are gonna add up in the end.,1
Iyer pls score today prove r/cricket wrong. I don't think you will though,9
Yeah our lower order truly sucks needed to play one of Moeen & Finch in middle order,4
RCB doesn't deserve top 4,9
155.... DC finishes it in 19.4 overs or falls short by 20... either way... both qualify....,7
[deleted],-2
DC can legit chase it under 17 overs 😭😭,10
"**19.4** Nortje to Udana, OUT,  **150-7**

I Udana c Iyer b Nortje 4 (2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00",2
Does this qualify as Collapse^(TM) ??,6
150 to defend in 17.1 overs is not bad per se. But even if we qualify we need two chances to reach final which won’t happen.,8
Nokia hatrick incoming,1
These cred ads are so annoying.,3
[deleted],14
Delhi bowled good !,2
[deleted],9
What DC really are missing is a proper leg spinner. Shouldn't have let Tejaswi Yadav go.,3
150-160 makes me very nervous. Hope RCB drags it to the 18th over. Don't fuck up the bowling changes VK,4
"Delhi to chase this Ez, Shaw to Turn up",2
Udana had to go for it can't blame him,5
Scenes if both qualify which is the most likely scenario tbh,3
Feels weird that there hasn’t been a hat trick this IPL. We had one for the past 3 years I think.,3
I prefer tiktok to josh and Instagram reels.,1
The only qualification to get into RCB is to be skinny. VK Dube Shahbaz DDP Chahal Washington,7
"Nortje did everything right today. Three wickets, tactical Koach drop to keep ABD inside.",23
"as a mumbai indian supporter i dont know if i want delhi or RCB

feel like if dhawan sucks this game too and they win, he will kill us

and same for kohli/ab",4
[deleted],97
25D play from rcb to only give themselves knockout games so they can play every match with INTENT,8
"This time I mean it.


Not gonna waste my time watching the 2nd innings.",6
"150 isn't hard to chase within 18 overs.

Remains to be seen how much DC loves KKR",6
This is so RCB it should not hurt.,2
Iyer lacks that killer instinct in his captaincy so I will never like him. Fucker is too defensive.,6
What does Shahbaz bowl? Missed his earlier game,2
Bye,2
We were 15-20 runs short and the dew came in. Incoming statement by Kohli.,10
[deleted],0
"When you look at it, DC has a pretty strong batting line up",6
Kohli should just retire from IPL tbh. Enough embarrassment,6
Scenes if the game goes to a superover,7
"Koach is so jittery, should cut his coffee consumption",3
"For those of you saying this is a bad total, it's not a meme-team matchup until both teams have memed.",4
I would bust a nut if our top order comes out striking from over 1. Fuck taking it deep,3
"At this point, I want to see Morris opening. I want to see an opening batsman with a strike rate higher than 120 for once.",4
DC has like 4 anchor role batsmen this total definitely looks chaseable. considering there 'form' right now.,4
Every batmen got to bat for RCB today. Nice.,5
Been a painful innings to watch to be honest. This is the ending it deserved.,2
Symbolic of Iyer's captaincy. Fucks shit up and then gets it right after taking damage. Like Gayle's over vs Deshpande before bringing on Ashwin. Like bringing on Sams early instead of Nortje today. and now this,14
Nah nah this score doesn’t look good,5
I haven't seen dhawan once lmao where is he?,16
Fuck Fuck Fuck,11
"From the team's No.4 batsman to running from byes, Sundar has come far",11
Nortje did very well.,4
RCB prob scored enough to ensure its a close enough game for both teams to qualify,7
This great over ngl,2
We don't wanna get Dhawaned today,2
"Is the announcer pronouncing it ""Dilly""?",2
"This is such a bang average total that there is no way that, irrespective of the final result, neither of the teams are going to come down below KKR in NRR.",3
Now I want Delhi to go all out for 100 runs,2
Brilliant last over Nokia. ..,5
Is today the day Dhawan and Pant go crazy and chase this down asap,6
RCB is truly the most legendary meme team,13
"Siraj please repeat the KKR heroics, it's the same ground",4
153 off 103 by DC and an SRH victory would see RCB eliminated,5
WE ARE SO FUCKED,7
Good night bois,7
Potentially one of the worst last overs i've ever seen,6
"I think 152 is fine for RCB. I don't see why DC would care about going out of their way to knock the total off early, they'd just care for the win. And they'll take their sweet time to get these runs. That is, assuming they get these runs at all. 

From here on, I'm backing the loser of this match to still qualify.",11
50/50 chances for both,3
The real target is 135. BC itna toh bana lena,8
Beautiful bowling mane,2
"Can someone tell me:

- In how many overs Delhi should chase
- By how many runs RCB should win

So that DC/RCB fall below KKR?",5
This is the bowling performance that carried us to 7 wins,14
"C'mon Dhawan , get a 50 here",4
How much overs should we defend this score now?,5
Delhi please just let us go to playoffs ffs,8
"Missing the ball and then running for a single looks like such a pussy thing to do, but runs matter so whatever",5
KL/Iyer both are shit captains. And Kohli had been mediocre. India desperately needs a good captain after Dhoni and I can’t see one for a long time smh.,11
"This was like a big budget movie with a story that goes no where
 (quoted from Seinfeld)",3
Ab came in too late,1
What an over from Nortje,3
What an over,1
"Thanks, AB for the brainfade runout.",7
Petition to get parthiv for Phillipe and use moeen in the lower order,3
"How many runs short are Koach's boys, eh?",3
WATCH THIS PITCH BECOME A ROAD MAGICALLY FOR DC,17
Now please Siraj the new ball.,6
That short of a good length at Nortje's pace is impossible to hit,4
AB did a brain freeze by taking that single and running for 2nd,6
"4 overs of Siraj today will determine KKRs fate, that is some meta shit",10
Rahane insurance inclusion in middle order looks like a master stroke.,4
"Waste target, Rahane can play a test innings and they can cross this.",3
"137 odd to qualify in 20 overs. Don't fuck this up, pls.",4
50 in the last 4. Usual koach and padikkal middle order fuck up. Nice.,5
25-30 runs short? Appalling display again.,4
"Say what you want about RCB not showing intent, but I feel this is about all that RCB can score.",8
"Great bowling effort from DC, feel RCB are 15 runs short.",4
"Friendly reminder:         
Target for DC to qualify: 134 runs          
Target for RCB to qualify: Take it to 18.1 accounting for the possibility of DC finishing with a 6 when 1 is required. Otherwise taking it to 17.3 suffices.",13
Mathbois do your thing,6
So now what should happen for KKR to qualify?,2
"Thinking so much about qualifying, I didn't even realize that it all doesn't matter when we lose in the playoffs anyway",6
20 runs short!,6
We are either gonna win this comfortably or get bowled out under 120. No inbetween.,8
Dhawan/Rahane needs to bat through.,2
So rcb need to defend this in 17.3 overs to make the cut right ?,7
Looks like a tough target if Sundar/Chahal are not handled with care by DC batsmen..,5
Score is enough to fuck KKR,10
"That's not enough, realistically cannot be defended. BUT, with some good bowling we should be able to drag it beyond the 18th over",8
**17.3 Overs** is the number,5
So DC need 133 to qualify and 153 to get thrashed by MI.,22
Not even surprised,0
Delhi please don't knock us out pleaseeee,4
congrats DC on the win. I go sleep now,3
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
Padikkal and Kohli are sucking the momentum out of the innings in the middle overs. Padikkal should not anchor the innings ffs.,4
why didnt RCB get the first run on 19.2 where ABD got run out trying for 2nd run?,6
Isn’t this the same pitch where CSK chased down 155 vs KXIP in 19 overs yesterday? RCB have to be careful,8
This is what happens for us when Rabada and Nortje bowl well. Solid performance so far.,4
Terrible score for us. I don't think DC can chase this under 17 overs,3
Inb4 delhi are 21/3 at the end of 6 overs.,3
"Dw guys we have Rahane on our side, this target is 180-esque for us",8
Every team tries to play 2-3 all-rounders in the middle. RCB plays 5 and they do nothing.,12
"Rcb need to get the openers early, it's a bit tuk-tuk after that.",4
"30 runs short, lets pray that DC doesn't chase within 18
 overs",5
135 to qualify right?,6
"Let's guess how much DC can score, 140-144? 130-135? 135-140? under 100?",3
DC need 137 to qualify,4
I think they should let AB get in at 3.. and kohli should come at 4.. Atleast kohli wud have a reason to do his tuk tuk once AB fails..,6
Someone please do the math for us KKR peeps,7
inb4 Kohli: we were 15-20 runs short,10
Yooo wtf people saying Kohli should retire from T20. What's this level of kneejerk reaction.,2
RCB 48 runs short,7
"Hope DD miss the beat trying to go too fast and bundle up. Otherwise, it’s a pretty gettable total.",2
"Rcb, do not fear. We undeniably will bottle this",2

Or will DC pull out the ultimate surprising move and score just 135 and qualify in peace",9
What are the odds for an Rcb win?,2
Not enough cause of Dew ™,5
I'd like to see AB go back to play for Delhi. He looks like he would fit in this team well.,2
It's Delhi's match to lose really. Bowling ain't easy with the dew.,1

Gotta win this. No fuckups,2

On the bright side for rcb fans there is no fucking way dc is chasing this in 17.1 overs,4

Should just dissolve the goddamn franchise so that we can go support MI in peace,5
No problem if Delhi wins but please don't end this in  17 overs and fuck us delhi,3
Just drag this until the 18th over. I beg of you.,2
Some mofo on Cricbuzz blaming Padikkal. Smh.,1
With this score it can still genuinely go either way. I really hope the Delhi boys can keep their calm today.,3
Download cred Download cred. That's what Alka said...,7
The ultimate meme team might be about to pull off the ultimate meme result - by getting knocked out (if SRH beat MI tomorrow and NRR permitting).,3
"Just don't bowl Siraj at death pls

Just make it close bhai. I want KKR out 😈 Ik that’s only if we win okay,3
So can DC just decide to drag it out after 18th over for a tactical advantage if they find RCB a better opponent than KKR or SRH,2
How should the second innings finish so that KKR's chances remain alive? Where's the stats guy?,7
Being a Delhi fan was easier when we had no hopes.,8

Csk is better off team than ours lol,9
"This is bound to happen, when your best hitter comes in at 13th or 14th over. Josh, DDP, koach aren't hitters. You need to have at least one hitter in the top who keeps powerplay running. Finch,our hitter fucked us hard in the arse. Now I don't think DC will be trying to win this before the 17th over, they'll just try to win. Unless RCBs bowlers perform shit or DCs batsman fuck up, DCs winning this match and we'll be in the 3rd or 4th position.",3
Kohli needs to bowl Siraj in the powerplay where he’s been most successful to pick up early wickets and then bowl him out in the middle instead of saving him for the death.,8

Prithvi Shaw is going to fuck this up. I can feel it.,3
Every time tries to have one experienced finisher and let all young guns bat around them. RCB don't have one finisher who is trustworthy to finish the game even if 50 were required of 5 overs.,6

DC score 133+ and lose, RCB finish 2nd and Delhi finish in 3rd or 4th

Is it 17.3 or 18.2?  Hearing conflicting numbers.,3
Delhi are definitely chasing 134 here. Sucks for KKR because they most certainly won't be going hell for leather in that process.,6
DC need 13 runs of last 3 overs. Siraj bowling 18th. 1st 2 balls dot. Next 2 balls 6. RCB are thinking they have done it since 17.4 overs are done. Only for DC to get another six off 5th ball and RCB are out,12

Gonna be a tricky chase I reckon,2
"Just asking, why would DC want to chase this in 17.3 overs. They don't want RCB to be knocked out I believe. They need to score just more than 134 runs",5

F YOU RCB COULDNT EVEN GET 1 WIN IN LAST 4. THERE WONT BE TOO MANY IPL’s WHERE OTHER TEAMS SCREW UP LIKE THIS. DC DONT DESERVE THE TOP 2 SPOT WHEN THEY GONNA GET 1 WIN IN THE LAST 5. KOHLI TAKE A PAY CUT YOU DESERVE NOWHERE NEAR 17 CRORES,9

Would love to see Prithvi find some form before the playoffs,2

This is literally similar pattern to WT20 2007 final. Low score. Fiery start chasing. Middle over choke.,1

It's only an over lads,2
Shaw redemption today?,1
Can the openers last powerplay,1
*Visible Confusion*,1
Dc has no incentive to finish this in 17.3,3
"Areas RCB has to work on:

Openers find gaps in the powerplay.   
Numbers 3-4 should play at a higher SR.     
Need better finishers.

Right. Practically the whole team",9

Delhi will be my second team from now if they get this score before 17 overs,2
This is why siraj wasn’t given new ball after taking 3-15,2
Ok we can lose that's fine we deserve it. But don't lose before 17 overs pls,1

Shaw looks like a 40 year old uncle.,1
How can you be a test quality bowler when you can't hold a line outside off stump!!!!! Is that too much to ask,2
Keep Kohli sundar AB and chahal and remove rest pls,2
If siraj is your power play bowler then I don’t know how they expect to win ipl.. they should disqualify themselves,1
"They keep doing this and Not try to hit sixes, and we'll be golden. There is absolutely no need to go for the lofted shot.",2
Look like Siraj take matter to his own hands.,2

Of course it did not help csk but it would have helped RCB",2

What a beauty,3
FUCK YES!!!,4

Just a reminder that Kohli never used Siraj with the new ball after the kkr match,6
Even siraj can't believe what he just did,2
Shaw is slightly better than Unmukt Chand was.,6

Dhawan pls don't get out thats all i ask,1
"Pls don’t bowl Morris in the pp. Why not give it to Sundar,he can bowl well to the lefty and Rahane can’t hit him",2
Shaw will go the Kuldeep way looks like ...get demoralised after an IPL season and go into an abyss ...unlike Kuldeep though he may use cough syrup to help him cope :),2
Why Morris after that all over the place 1st over. Why?,3
Don't know why Shaw is hyped so much..,4
WHY DONT U BOWL SUNDAR BRO,10
So it's all pomp and no Shaw today.,5
Dhawan is gonna have one of *those* days isn’t he?,4
"I like how everyone wants this midget to open in Australia with that kind of technique. Like seriously, dude has got no footwork, struggles against short pitched delivery, and has so much gap between his bat and pad. Someone like Starc will easily eat him for a breakfast.",8

Give Washi the pp instead of Morris ffs,5
Why the fuck does Koach keep messing around with not using Sundar in the powerplay. Dude has yet to disappoint. Fuck this brain-dead captaincy.,4
If this is a slow pitch why is Morris bowling now???,3
"Harsha Bhogle: ""No towels used yet"" 

\*Sreeshant fixing Flashbacks*",7
Gabbar this is the ipl not an ICC tournament please get out,10

Im disappointed as an indian fan with shaw batting like this. Hes still very young luckily but i really hope we see some improvement in technique because when he's on song he's a joy to watch. You hate to see a prodigy go to waste.,9
Siraj's bowling seems to be a lot influenced by Mohammed Amir..,11

Delhi please ffs,5
"Shaw out

Dhawan : So anyway I started blasting",6
Inb4 Kohli doesnt give Siraj the next over,3
Morris being back to his older IPL days,2
'Rahane the fielder - no batter i mean' freudian slip....,2
Two more 9 run overs pls DC Morris,2
Yes let's keep bowling on the pads ffs,2
Goddamnit no way DC gonna chase this in 17 overs,2
"Who's that Josh App 'Cheetah-Cheater' tongue-twister guy?

Seems as if I have seen that dude somewhere..",3
Funny that everyone except dc and rcb fans want dc to finish it before 17.3,5
Mohammad Siraj is a new ball bowler. I hope Koach will remember that from here on.,6
Why is Rahane batting at No. 3 for both RCB & DC?,2
"Dhawan: If I have to chase this down, can't trust my team not to muck this up later.",2
Josh ads are cancer,4
I don't like this field placement,1
csk and rr did you already go away or can we join you?,2
"Harsha just said on air “...Rahane, the fielder...” in a Freudian slip lol",6
"Feel like Rahane can win this game today


For RCB",0
Why is every other ball on tthe pads???,0
Ponting going the kohli way benching the pinch hitter and going with 3 Openers.,1
Get. Dhawan. Early.,1
Morris needs to be released,-3
It wud be the kohliest thing to do to stop siraj and get sundar now,9
"Morris is overrated. There, I said it.",5
"Rahane needs his WC 2016 semi form

For RCB offcourse",2
Are these ppl trained from Umesh Yadav academy. Almost all deliveries are on pads jeez,0
Can someone tell the fucking bowlers to bowl slow! Wtf did they learn while batting?,0
"Want to be as relaxed as virat?

Lol the irony",0
Why is this song playing in a cricket match?,1
Yes dont bowl Sundar in powerplay.,3
"I think with Shaw out, both these teams will qualify.",2
Lord Siraj really wearing sunscreen during a night game,6
This fucking team is so frustrating.,2
Josh Philippe runs a bit like Steve Smith.,2
If punjab had won their last this match would have been a literally knockout,1
Are these DC BCs looking to eliminate us? F off,0
ICC Dhawan is here.,-1
Morris cannot be your main bowler.. no way you winning matches with him with that role..,2
Morris showing why he moves from franchise to franchise every year,2
"Once upon a time, I was a very optimistic person then I became a RCB fan.",2
"Thala said, ""If you don't take Shikar's wicket, he will keep the strike rate up"". and he is right.  Modern day Shewag. Take him out and 2nd spot is RCB.",1
Dhawan ich liebe dich,1
Dhawan is back to his old form. We are screwed.,1
Dhawan back to basics ✨🙏,0
"Come on Sikhar n Ajinkya

Show kohli how t20 is played",-3
Come on siraj. You can do this shiz.,0
DC just don't lose a wicket please.,-1
Dhawan please ffs ffs ffs,0
RCB : What are you doing step-Dhawan !?,8
Fuck,0
Bruh Cork is wheeezing on the mic lol,2
Shaw duped rcb into thinking Siraj was actually doing shit,1
Dhawan <3,1
Just a reminder that this is the first time after the kkr match that Siraj is bowling with the new ball,4
What a shot!,1
A peak Rihanna innings here will be a win-win for both teams,10
"Yar max 5 runs this over w/o wicket. 
Siraj at death is needed. If he gets a wicket here, they'll bowl him another",-1
Giving away way too many boundaries!!,2
Lee calling Siraj as Shiraz never gets old.,9
Fucking ICC Dhawan HAD to show up today,3
The MRF ezeeride ad is fkin legendary,2
Siraj back to RCB form,-1
What was RCB doing on this great batting pitch ?,1
Dhawan is KKR's best opener this season.,7
DHAWAN PLS GET OUT,0
Morris had the best economy of all fast bowlers before this match. Couple bad overs and he's completely shit now according to r/cricket,10
"Fun fact I’ve just discovered. You can get IPL shirts on Amazon.

Less than fun fact, they’re £74.99 the fucking robbing bastards.",3
"Cricket = weird sport. “Oh they’re using towels now”
“ they are rubbing their ball vigorously”.",1
Jesus Dhawan calm down.  You can win just take it deep.,1
102 more needed then,1
Why is this by going with pace? KohlI is honestly the most clueless captain I’ve seen in ipl,2
"Dhawan 100,100,0,0, 100?",4
Dhawan only dealing in SHOT boundaries,0
Cricinfo : Siraj's 5 wickets in the powerplay are the most for RCB this season. I wonder how many more he would have likely had if he was used more often in the powerplay. They held him back last game against SRH as well.,0
Koach to Iyer: Take the match to 17.3 overs and I take you to Australia,7
Kohlis come on miya was gold lol,2
In before Siraj takes wicket this over,1
How does tomorrow's match impact today's result?,2
Dhawan wants to chase it in 10 overs,4
Sekhar!!,1
"Taking inspiration from Pant, MRF named the tyres as 'ezeetyres'",3
"People asking why Siraj in test matches?

1.He is in team but not first choice so he may not play.

2.He got a good record in Ranji Tournament.

3.He can be lethal if he keeps improving.

4.Koach likes him lol jk but he will have a lot to learn in Australia.",5
"Munna Bhaiyya : 

Shikhar Dhawan bhai, ab aisa hai.. 

Ab bahut ko gaya, chouka, chouka

Jaldi Sheeghra Patan ho ja /s",-2
Shaw got an absolute beaut. I think he had show before he got out that he can control his impulsive nature.,1
Rcb need to create pressure not to give away loose ball yaar!,3
DC literally just playing to screw over RCB,3
Looks like today the Hundred-Dhawan has turned up. See you later zero-Dhawan,2
The bowling has been pretty terrible so far except for the one delivery that got Shaw.,1
[deleted],2
Ffs Siraj it's not swinging..stop bowling overpitched balls,-2
"Delhi, win the match but do it after 17 overs pls",7
Ha RCB if only you had boom and boult,3
Where is sundar?,1
Why not open the bowling with Sundar and Siraj? Koach?,4
Sreesanth wanted to make a comeback in IPL. CSK will pick him next season. Fits the age criteria,9
Match will be over in 15 overs,0
Dhawan and Iyer and Pant might wanna take it deep not to get on Koach's bad side when it comes to the national team lmao,2
Who has been better this season: Dhawan or Rahul?,1
Bowl 8 overs of Sundar and Chahal to take it deep. Dont lose in 15 overs FFS,4
"If dew is already showing , isn't it better to get Sundar in early ?",1
Les goo Shikha,1
"There should be a ""Least Valuable Player"" award in the IPL. And instead of a colored cap, it should be a cone of shame that dogs get.

Shaw is at the top (bottom?) of that list. Garbage batsman, poor fitness so he can't run or field ....

Just trash.",61
Only Rahane can take both rcb and DC to the playoffs...,5
Kholi might be the must clueless captain ever.,0
Why am I shaking??,3
This is good strategy to attack so RCB can shit their pants,5
Rahane should open with Dhawan and Prithvi should come in after Iyer tbf,3
Dhawan the RCB hater,4
Why does the Dugout always laugh whenever Styris says Siraj’s name?,2
"All Shitane needs to do is keep rotating the strike.

Dhawan will do the rest.",6
"Why can't our players play like that?

Actually why?",9
Rahane always has the constipated look on his face,13
Looks like DC is filled with KKR fans :),6
"Dhawan keep the century for the playoffs, pls don’t do it today",11
Danny Morrison is a pretty good commentator when he's not shouting garbage.,5
We are fucked. DC on the way to chase it before the 16th over.,6
Siraj on the money,4
"Fuck rahane 

Fucked DC whole season now fucking us",5
The best end to this game would be pant scoring 50(25) to make dc win in 15 overs and then belly dancing in front of koach,25
"They didnt even stick with Maxwell after his loose form this season, why continue with Shaw seeing his lackluster performance",5
I'll feel like we've won half the battle if we can get Dhawan out relatively early..,4
Delhi looks dangerous only if dhawan shines. And yall blame us for being over dependent on Warner :l,6
"Nothing against siraj but both rcb and commentators are just hyping him too much ...Saini is good but siraj is ok ok..
Not the third seamer you want behind shami and bumrah.",0
As long as Rahane is on the crease RCB still has a chance,3
Rahane hai to mumkin hai..,1
"Why are we playing 3 spinners if kohlis gonna use them after the powerplay?

Is he saving them for the death?",0
rcb have to get dhawan. otherwise theyre screwed,3
Lord siraj today.,3
Stop drifting on to the pads,4
"Dhawan playing for kkr, rahane playing for rcb",27
"Gabbar is a big match player, isn't he",8
Rahane is RCB’s main hope,8
"Yes Rahane, that's the way. Remember we got a test series in Australia coming up.",17
Wicket pls,2
[deleted],2
Well done. Siraj should be done for the pp I feel,6
Yes rahane tuk tuk this to 17.3,5
Can we count on Rahane to not let DC win before 17.2,5
"Shaw is 20 years old. Instead of bashing our talent for the future and making them unconfident, we should support them :)",9
Fuck that single,1
So Iyer is gonna play like Pant. Pant is gonna play like Stoinis. Stoinis like Hetmyer. I will take that deal /s,2
"Looks like we just have to hope MI just beat SRH or we are not qualifying. Honestly RCB deserve this, have been playing shit cricket for the last 4 games. With this form, they can't hope to win the cup anyways tbh.",3
"As if this game couldn't get more hype, here's fkin Darude Sandstorm",5
[deleted],2
KKR agent Dhawan vs RCB agent Rahane,6
[deleted],3
Can this Sams guy bat,1
Rahane truly hates everyone,3
"How the fuck did we go from ""oh look at all these teams with their 8 points"" to ""just don't get rolled out before 134 runs pls""",3
"RCB fans are fucking delusional! The reason RCB is successful this season is because of players like DDP, Morris and Saini who have given some stability to otherwise inconsistent team!",1
Maxwell and Shaw should form their own IPL team.,2
Any good ointment for ass? This amount of clench isn't natural for butts,5
I feel moving Pant to 5 might turn out to be a good decision for DC. He wouldn't have to worry about anchoring the innings and can go apeshit from ball 1,1
Rahane please play conservative 20 runs in 50 balls,4
Darude sandstorm,3
"Rahane's nemesis is here, spin",2
"Can ipl final be championship of 7 matches like nba or chess or is it too much.

Teams coming back from 3-1 to win it will be amazing to watch.",4
Time for Washington,3
Feel like I haven't seen a thigh slap in a long time,3
Has Rahane played any significant IPL inning since 2016 WCSF 40 ball 40???,3
Rahane getting ready for Australia,2
"Fucken flog rahane, I hate you to no limits",1
Washington is a real fucking Chad,3
did i hear darude sandstorm,5
What happened to Morris?,1
Siraj bowled decent 1st over. And tried another 1. Ppl shitting here over captaincy. Lmao,2
I can't imagine the trolls we have to face from csk if we don't qualify. Spare us from the humiliation please.,4
I think Koach should use Siraj like Thala uses Deepak Chahar.Bowl straight 3 overs in Power play and if possible try to complete his spell or 3 overs will be okay.,4
"Peak RCB moment would be, DC need two to win and it’s 17.2. Ball goes for a single and Koach is relieved they are through just for 3rd ump to buzz in a no-ball call. Koach goes full meltdown",3
how much does rcb or dc need to lose by to have a lower NRR than KKR?,1
Darude - Sandstorm. They don't make tunes like that these days.,2
"Rahane, perfect bloke to push that required rate above 10",4
WHat happened to Morris?,1
Yes rahane that's the way,1
SPIN,4
Just get Dhawan and leave the rest to Iyer/Rahane/Pant.,5
"yes rahane keep it up 

you will win the match for both of us and team india will love ur knock during tests. win-win-win",6
"DC fans happy that rahane isn't getting out
Rcb fans happy Rahane playing dot balls",5
There is turn.. chahal will love it,6
Why is Rahane in the team again?,0
Dube better bowl in this game. I think he bowled in 3 matches and got wickets in all.,3
One wicket here and Delhi will play more carefully atleast till the 15th over.,5
"If you're a KKR fan, you should tune in tomorrow and hope for an MI win. This is not going to work out for you guys.",4
Washi ball spins . Its spinners paradise guys.,3
Rahane not you too,5
WASHINGTON to DC,9
"Why can’t we bat like this in PP, no slogging, low risk traditional shots, > 8.5 rpo",6
[deleted],5
"Rahane is best. Pls rahane, BATDEEP ™",7
"Ajinkya bro play faster. Por favor, Senior!",2
That's the way Rahane,2
Rahane haters le boundary,4
Why r these commentators so biased?,2
"non-indians of reddit, who is your favourite indian player and why is it rahane?",9
4? No problem but thanks God he didn't took the catch :),3
Ajinkya TukTuk-ane looking out of form today. His SR is almost 100!,3
Don't try to get Rahane's wicket RCB,1
Why are people blaming Rahane do you want a collapse?,7
How SRH has that good NRR even after losing those many matches,2
"Chahal giving advice to Kohli, ah the IPL",5
Umesh Yadav averages something like 50 in Australia even after 3 tours there. Siraj should play over him if Ishant is not fit.,4
"Will Rahane get a team to play after big auction? I think not. Unless some moronic management like KXIP decides to buy him, cause why not.",5
more of that Jinx,2
Chahal giving tips to bhaiya,7
Chahal for captaincy?,3
Wait Dube will bowl today? I'm scared,2
"I swear supporting DC, KXIP and SRH this year has taken a few years out of my life.",6
"I don't understand how nrr works but should DC reach 158, than the target no of overs for RCB will be 18.1 overs not 17.3.  RCB should bowl a wide if it ever comes to that",1
How can someone so young be so bad at fielding?,2
"Imagine this situation: 

DC needs 5 runs in last 2.5 overs and Pant hits a Six on the next ball to make sure RCB's RR is below KKR.

.

.

.
 
What will Kohli say to Pant then?",10
"Rahane batting like he is  only looking to chase 134, for qualification xD",5
Rahane will ensure RCB qualifies.,2
Wouldn’t be shocked if RCB drop a catch of Rahane xD,8
Chahal better captain than Koach,8
"Dhawan is better than Rohit in t20.

Come at me.",-5
"C'mon Jinks, you can do it",5
can kohli take a paycut after this shitshow? no way are we keeping him for 18crs,20
Play the anchor role Jinx. No risk whatsoever please,3
Jinx sweep shot is such a treat to watch,4
Rahane should be the flag bearer of the Thala Academy of Sensible Batsmanship after MSD retires from everywhere.,11
Why are RCB fans taking shots at Rahane when they have Kohli and Padikkal in their team lol,11
Dhawan don't get out pls,1
"If we don't get two back-to-back wickets soon, then this chase is probably done.",5
Maybe jinx should have been 4 for india all along.,6
"Chad Gabbar is here, game over RCB",8
Rahane on his day can be very painful for opposite team. Still remember how well he used to play against MI in his RR days.,12
"I'm all for shitting on RCB batsmen ..... but come on guys. It's still in the power play ....... Rahane doesn't need to speed up all that much. They're chasing 153 ..... not 203.

Play conservatively without losing wicket so that the finishers can come in and do work in the 15-20 overs. His aim should be to last until 8-10 the over and build a good partnership. Dhawan needs someone to build a partnership with.

He's doing just fine.",11
Dhawan please we are not Australia don't attack us,10
Unpopular opinion: Washington sundar is just a 95kmph medium pacer disguised as a spinner,11
Pretty sure RCB DC and KKR will qualify and the hype that was created about bottom 4 teams fighting back would be rendered to shit.,18
Delhi finishes it on 17.2. Heard it here first,11
DC ain't chasing 113 of 77,3
I dream of seeing a 70-0 score at the end of the powerplay for Delhi one day,11
Cmon lads,4
ABD acting like Pant!,7
This was our PP score,1
RCB on track to take it deep,2
"Why is ABD Keeping,if josh is in the team?",10
A 30 odd here and Rahane would book a spot for the next IPL,6
AB unusually vocal today,10
DC need 134 to qualify for the playoffs,5
RCB should rather aim at defending 133 because the same will be on DC's mond too,2
"Lol jokes apart, I remember Rahane had a pretty decent season last year.",7
Rcb's done. Not sure why I'm still watching,1
Get dhawan pls,1
"Udana Udana, tu Hai meri fantasy",6
Bc bacha,1
This Steve Smith duplicate is whispering a lot  hahaha,6
Feels so much better to hear ABD's voice than Pant's constant cackling,9
"ab saying "" not a long bating line up, just 2 more lads""",14
Bring chahal need few wicket's,1
[deleted],2
"I like how much they're praising rahane, like trying to praise him into form.",5
imagine all this hype and MI wins tom,2
"If RCB manage to qualify, Finchie's taking them to the finals.",2
Delhi please play 13 overs.,2
cmon dc show kohli what real delhi is,9
Why not bowl Siraj for another over?,3
"Fielders at the 30 yard circle: Do you want us to save boundaries or singles?

Koach: No",16
Please save us,4
92 more needed,2
Should’ve been Siraj and washi sharing new ball for 6 overs.,9
"Bring in pant, he'll ensure that dc chase it before 17.3

It's cuz koach didn't pick him for LOIs /s",9
"Does anyone remember the fearless Rahane who used to counterattack batting at 6 in tests and played beautiful shots in the powerplay in limited overs cricket? Now he just struggles, no beauty left in his game.",10
Udana will probably get Dhawan here,1
RCB's performance today reeks of KXIP's yesterday,1
"RCB and DC have had the gentleman agreement that whoever wins will do it so that the other doesn't get knocked out, or have they?",2
It’s wild that there are 2 Afghanistan players in IPL but only 1 from SL. And none from Bangladesh rn.,7
"Isuru Udana?

More like.. ab shuru Udana",4
"is cricket a dirty game? all that spit, saliva, sweat and then when it helps bowler take 5-for, he kisses it.",3
Love you Dhawan,1
I was gonna say with every ball bowled RCB would get closed to qualify. But then I realised that's every cricket game.,3
Not udana right now ffs!!!!!!,3
Are you a Udana sceptic?,1
Do they get their demographics? They advertise MXTakatak and Mutual Funds to the same people.,4
Rcb needs a wicket desperately  to take this game close.,3
Why is ABD keeping? Was that his choice? Joshua is the keeper. Don't they have faith in his keeping to spinners?,8
Dhawan pinching singles like Kohli wishes he could,3
When you hear the commentators praising Rahane's positive intent and see his strike rate of 80.,5
Faithless - We Come One is the only song the DJ isn't allowed play as it can lead to run outs if a batsman start singing along.,2
"ABD: Just 2 more boys

Stoinis coming at 6: *am I a joke to you?*",6
Don't care whoever wins but one of them should join us at airport,12
Camera work is really shitty today,3
"Guess: Who'd be safe first?

Can DC hit 132 before 17.3 overs?",1
Both of these teams should be able to make the playoffs. On the other hand MI will want to win the match against srh to let kkr in. Srh has always been scary in playoffs and for mi personally too. Kkr is a walk in the park for mi.,3
Some really poor bowling changes by Kohli here,2
"When Washington Sundar has a bad day on the field, does RCB call him

Washington Baddsoorat?",7
"42-1 after 5 overs, with 2 Siraj overs already gone ..... is damn good for DC.

If any other batsman can build a partnership with Dhawan, they should be able to chase this.

Watch out for an epic collapse if Dhawan goes out though ....",3
Is there a plan here or is Kohli just sending bowlers to bowl at this point?,3
Who benches Lara for 2 years?,1
"That Chess Olympiad level discussion during Washington Sundar's last over, lol. Makes you wonder whether RCB had any plans before the match.",5
"AB's keeping has been solid, he's actually a better keeper than Phillipe.",1
I'm pretty sure Kohli is bowling out his best bowlers before they cross 17.3 instead of going for the win,5
Agent Rahane playing for both teams equally,3
Should get the spinners done if there is dew right?,1
"A RCB fan template:

Get stressed out for the match 5 hours before

Panic as Koach loses the toss

Watch as Philippe and DDP slowly carry the powerplay before a couple wickets fall

Grudgingly watches Kohli walks out and gets out for 11(13)

Awes as AB hits a couple sixes and gets out for 21(15)

Middle order collapses.

Quits watching",83
Why not Siraj?,5
Siraj should have bowled out his quota.,3
Ffs a boundary every over,7
Let's goo Jinksy,2
Everyone brings their best against rcb to take out all their frustrations on Virat lmao,6
Why Udana now??? Kohli make some sensible decisions please!,3
Is the DJ only playing same song after each boundary?,1
"What shithousery bowlers do RCB have, if Rahane is hitting you.",0
FFS Isuru. That length is shit,2
DC Need 106 off 73 now.,2
"Two Orthodox batsmen, BC. 

Jaldi out karo BC.",4
Come on r/cricket y'all promised me a tuk tuk rahane... what is this?,15
"Delhi really lack an absolute top class 4th foreigner, should keep sams for the next game",4
Why weren’t the Rcb openers playing this way?,12
"Typical brainless captaincy from Kohli, siraj was bowling well why did he take him off",1
"Imagine if Rahane our of all the players decide to play a blinder today and chase this down before 17.3

RCB would have every right to be salty",5
"Are you seeing this? This is what we lack all time, fucking boundaries.",9
Such a shitty team going through because of NRR is a travesty.,-1
Shaw lost his plot after quitting his cough syrup 😔.,6
How tf did that go four,8
Pujara and Vihari might massively underperform in the Ind/Aus series as they havent played any cricket in almost 7 months,3
bye bye rcb see you next year,11
Chudana lol,3
WTF,1
This conservative approach of Koach and the team he picked for T20's show why India is a shit T20 team despite hosting a tournament like IPL. Except fuccboi no body can bang from ball 1 in our side.,26
Rahane now you are scaring me ...,2
"Fuck you DC, hope MI fists you again :)",10
How has that gone for 4,5
Why are the fielders diving around the ground for no reason lmao,3
"Ah, the Damien Martyn forward defence for 4",5
RCB😂😂👌🏽,3
Udana isn't worth an international slot sorry,9
RCB are gonna get knocked out aren't they?,1
We got this Bois.,2
Eh? How the fuck did that go for 4 lol,5
Oh my god how is that four,4
"RCB bois, dw, at this rate they'll take 17 overs to complete anyway",5
What a fuckin joke of a boundary to concede 😂😭,8
Rahane showing us why he plays tests,3
Lmao how is that a 4,7
what is going on with RCB's fielding,6
Exquisite shot from Rahane,7
"dc gaining momentum,  rcb is fooked big time",8
MI is our last hope,7
"Beautiful Rahane, sublime touch.",6
"Suppose you have a wicket taking swing bowler who has taken a wicket in his first over. What would you do?

a) Bring him for another over.

b) Bowl him at the death where he's a run machine.",24
Rahane's exhibition.,6
Shit bowling Shit Fielding Shit Luck everything that is RCB.,13
Anyone still backing RCB?,7
Oh well! It was a nice run this year. See you next year guys.,12
"Damien Martyn-esque punch towards mid-off.

Lovely",6
Loooooolll,2
Unironically this has been one of our best PP,6
Is it me or is RCB fielding kind of lazy.,3
Delhi care for the memes,1
why do mi fans here hate us lol,2
"Forget DC, Rahane is playing for his place in the tournament next year.",3
[deleted],4
Rahane is exactly playing like what DC need right now,3
Most atrocious bowling by RCB at the wrong time!,7
just 9 an over to kill Koach's dreams,2
"Noob question: Why do wicketkeepers generally tend to keep encouraging the bowlers all the time?
Or is it because of the stump mic closer to them and all the players are doing the same?",8
Philippe can neither keep nor play against spinners. Could have stuck with Finch for his experience or Parthiv for his keeping or opened with Moeen for the extra bowling option.,1
So many whys when RCB plays. Lol.,11
"Even Rahane is hitting 4's, peak 2020",3
"as has been the story the past few games, looks a different pitch when the opposing team bats",14
100 runs 12 overs and dc and kkr both qualify,3
99 runs required in 69 balls for KKR to overtake RCB.,12
"Whatever the result, all I really want is a stare-off between Kohli and Pant.",10
"Dc slow down, you can finish it araam se by the 19th over",6
slow balls and sl bowlers. name a better duo,9
"Chidiya udi ...maina udi ...isuru uda

Bad attempt at humor",8
"Why the fuck mid-off is standing so close inside the circle? 

Last ball single chaahiye kya?",5
Iyer and Pant don't run like that,3
"""Fuck RCB""

\- Dhawan & Rahane (???)",5
Best RCB Captain = Yuzi,10
DC playing like they want to knock RCB out too.,5
Dc should accelerate after they reach 132 and try to win it before 17.3 overs to keep rcb as the official meme team of the ipl.,11
Just 82 runs boys. Please play like this,3
Rahane is playing some classical cricket that even Damien Martyn would be mildly jealous of.,4
"104 kmph delivery going to ropes and he just defends it... 
That's skillful from Rahane",4
rcb officially the shittiest team to ever make the top 4,8
"Brilliant powerplay, I hope Dhawan and Rahane keeps playing like this for another 6 overs atleast..",5
81 more needed,1
Game over for DC once Chahal starts bowling,2
I have a feeling Chahal will pul this back for us.,6
Fun fact: Rahane is reverse Samson. In his last 3 matches of each IPL season he scores more than remaining matches.,4

"If DC continue scoring at 9 RPO, they’ll make the target in exactly 17 overs",5
Siraj diving instead of chasing the ball to give away 2 extra runs - unacademy thinking lol,10
This is worse than when they lost 6 in a row.,7
We need to bowl the next 5 overs without conceding a boundary,2

Rahane scoring at better clip than Kohli,3
What's the golden number of overs for KKR?,2
Looks like there's a bit of panic among the rcb players... DC players look much mote calm,4

"11.3 over 100 runs, please dc you can do it",5
Peak RCB,1
Have been calling for Moeen Ali in place of Udana. Wish I was the coach!,6
Udana had some good line and length there but just bowls way too slow,2
This is like the ideal Rahane target to chase.,6
"Okay RCB are pretty sure they are not going to win. Atleast drag it past 17.3 overs. Shit fielding, no intent. Disappointed",3
Chad Rahane saving his best for the do or die game.,3

Rahane is based today,1
Why does DC want to knock us out? I thought we were friends,9
Damn Amitabh Bacchan looking sharp in that Gujrat tourism ad!,2
I kinda want both DC and RCB to qualify. But DC is priority of course,2

100 runs needed off 68 balls for the memes.,13
Unacademy founder looks like prithvi shaw without cough syrup,5
Kohli is a rank bad captain. Sad to see KKR go out like this,7
I hope someone has told Kohli it's okay to lose today after the 18th over. That will make sure they get to the playoffs.,2
"If it weren't for that shitshow against SRH, RCB would have been comfortable now",5
RCB and their talent for making pitches look absolutely unplayable until the chasing team comes in.,9
"It's Painful watching this, I'll check the score later and see if it's worth watching.",4
I think we’re done for the season :(,5

Amitabh 👍🏽,-2
"No intent from RCB, they look visibly tired.",6
Please RCB. DRAG IT OUT TO 18 overs,5

Didi ke Shaadi mei dhoom machane mei aur Accha match dikhane mei kya relation hai uncle ji?,5
RCB should just pick up Dhawans wicket and let iyer and rahane carry on.. no way they are finishing the chase before 17.3 overs,8
fuck all stuff here. Don’t think we deserve to go through with a performance like this.,10
Why do you backstab us DC?,15
"Come on DC.

MI gotta rest everybody tomorrow. Let Rohit and maybe Kishan play but rest everybody else. Will be disappointed if we are not playing the likes of Prince Balwant Rai, Anmolpreet and Digvijay Deshmukh.",8
"Looks like DC is well on course to chase this comfortably. Don't think they'll do it under 17.3 or whatever that is, which means both DC and RCB will qualify.",4
OOTL on Prithvi Shaw and cough syrup. Explain pls,10
100 from 69 ain’t hard at all but the powerplay has ended :/,3
"csk,rr and kxip can you guys wait for us a bit longer . We can give company",3
RCB had these many runs after 8 or 9 overs. In hindsight maybe they should've batted faster.,3
The only hope now for KKR is for MI to beat SRH tomorrow.,1

i almost forgot rahane existed as a player,2

Is Fargo's season 2 as good as its season 1? Apologies for off topic comment.,3
I think Canara Bank just used their 5 second ad from YouTube. There’s even a “click to apply”,5
DC win?,3
If Rahane finds form tonight I'll forever be an RCB fan,10
So weird how your innings gains momentum if you're constantly looking to get on top bowlers. I wonder if this a strategy Kohli could try with his team?,3
Why is everyone shitting on kohli? What's he doing wrong?,3
Clutch time,2
Every other team has managed to keep Rahane under 20 let's see how many RCB concede.,4
"Rcb Fans are you sure you still want Rahane to bat deep ? 


Rahane 15 runs in his last 7 balls. 

Dhawan 10 runs in his last 7 balls.",3

"DC after beating RCB in 18 overs : YDI

RCB: YDI?

5 bowlers in 7 overs. Wow Koach,2
Koach specifically told Chahal not to dismiss Rahane lol,0
Frndship ended with Koach and Iyer. Pollard bhaiya is my best friend now.,23
Batting depends on AB. Bowling depends on Chahal.,7
IM GONNA SAY IT. AS LONG AS VK IS THE CAPTAIN OF RCB. RCB WILL NEVER WIN THE IPL,13
Defending 100 in 69 balls should be easy since DC don't have any urgency. Plan for 18 overs.,5

Please RCB do something,3
I only trust Chahal to give us some chance to qualify,2
I say use all the best bowlers till 17 th over. Treat is as that.,5
Does DC have any motivation to win the game before the 18th over?,5
"MI is most likely fielding their B team tomorrow. If these two teams take it close, then it won't matter who wins tomorrow.",3
Sometimes I love delay of 1 ball in my stream. Just to ensure that there's no wicket fallen,3

Leave everything and bowl 12 overs of spin now,8

Cmon DC. Hit ffs,1
RCB should Yuz this bowler to get some wickets.,6
which country does chahal dislike the most? Singapore.,6

Chahal and sundar need to choke Delhi for runs.,1

The only hope now for rcb is srh losing tomorrow,6

Cheeky Rihanna has his eyes on 17.3,3

"Come on delhi, please end this early",2
Rahane Dhawan should actually see this thru easily... long as they don't do anything Pant-like.,1
Whoever losses this match goes out of the tournament right ?,1

How is Rahane playing with a better SR than Kohli ffs,3
My brain is getting fried right now,5
That was plumb.,-2
Fucking shit first time in years Rahane decides to fire and of fucking course it's against us that's some top tier bullshit man,8
"Honestly i don't rate rabada much, today was the first time he got a wicket in pp. He basically takes the wickets in the death overs when the batting team decide to go big or go home. Archer, boult are much much better bowlers, because they consistently get wickets in pp. They attack. Rabada defends. Bumrah is in another league. He can bowl anywhere and take wickets also can control the run flow.",10
Should've fucking reviewed that,3
By what over should DC win for RCB to go below KKR?,4
Only way I see DC scoring in 17 overs is if they send in Stoinis next and he goes wild.,7
Yar dhawan survive these 2 balls,2
rcb innings had way more dot balls. dc is rotating strike really well and showing intent,8
That's almost half the ball. Fucking shit umpiring.,10

Rahane MVP playing exactly what is needed. No dot balls.,3

Calm down gabbar. No need to take risk right now. Play till 14 overs and then go for it,2
No way this batting is gonna score anything above 150 against MI,7
Lezzzgoo ready for a DC MI cracker of a match!!,-2
I hope the management don't fire Hesson and Katich after one season if we bottle it.,6
Nah. I think RCB are safe. They'll chase the score by 19th over.,12

"Shahbaz vs dhawan ? 
But why?",-2
no dot balls whatsoever to put some pressure and fielding hasn't helped either..,1
Btw they need to score with just 10 runs per over to finish it by 17th over and remove rcb,-2
"In Aus Test Series Top scorer Indians:


Top scorer in 2014: Kohli



Top Scorer In 2018: Pujara



Top scorer in 2020: Rahane.



- Rahane will credit Ponting for minor adjustments in his game after Man of the series ❤️",3
All this for mi to eventually win the tournament,6
"So if Dehli chase this down in 17 overs and Hyderabad pull off a win against Mumbai, will Bangalore be knocked out?",6
Omg rahane is playing well?:DDDD,-1
I saw a video of rcb's team talk after srh loss. Seems to have no effect on them lol,-1
I hope Koach doesn’t select Shaw to open in Australia especially in D/N test. That would be one of his dumbest decisions,3
Come on DC. Target this guy. Finish em before 17.3,-2
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",3
Another thing I've noticed is how spread out the RCB field always looks; it was very evident in csk v rcb,-1
Why would Delhi try to finish before 17.3? There's nothing in it for us. Should just play it safe and secure top 2,8
What if DC score more than 134 and loose. Hypothetical?!,0
"Kohli - 'IPL Thi Isliye Jane Diya, Ind-SL series hoti toh baahon mai hoti'",8
Is it just me imagining this or indian batsmen hit less sixes to spinner.,1
Well bowled,-1

Please? 👉👈🥺",8
Kohli looks like a student who hasn't studied shit for an exam,5

Nhi chahiye bheekh ki playoffs when we will shit there again & get knocked out brutally",3
Yes we get it Harsha you want DC to take this deep. Why does Harsha love RCB this much?,-1
only way mi is not winning this ipl is if one the team channel their inner rr,0

"Lack of intent from both the teams?

They both know there's no need to be that aggressive. Both playing safely.",1
Don't think Delhi will look to finish in 45 balls. Stakes are high. So RCB is safe but definitely doesn't deserve to be in playoffs.,10
50+ matches gone and the fake crowd noise is still annoying. Waiting for the Australian tour to see cricket with actual crowd,5
What scares me is that Kohli probably has Siraj saved for the end of middle overs,13
bat 7 overs pls,7
Serial downvoter is here,11
RCB media people and content creators > Real RCB players out in the fucking middle. 😡😡😡😡😡,7
This is the worst fielding i have seen this year.,1

Shahbaz has only balled 4 balls and sweating like he's been bowling for 10 overs straight,4
"Shahbaz - Look at me, I am the Sundar now",2
Kohli gets paid 17 crores🤡,11
Lookslike DC is going for 17.3.,1
"Sorry to break it to u, but it's unlikely for the 17.3 finish",6
"As a neutral I either want one of two things to happen 

A) Dehli absolutely thrash RCB and with a win from SRH tomorrow for RCB to be knocked out of the tournament 

Or B) Siraj to take a hattrick to singlehandedly turn the game round.",6
"If Delhi go to 2nd place then MI's bowling will be too much to handle for their fragile batting line-up, thus gifting MI a free spot in the finals. Sad times",1

17.3 has potential for meme if DC chases before that and RCB gets knocked out,2

DC too cautious,16
Upvoting every comment to restore the balance in the force.,19

158 in 18.1",12
Is that dumbass downvoter-sama back again?,11
Delhi playing with the confidence of a side that knows they only need 50 runs to qualify,7
Names on the back of jerseys in cricket are useless. Even more useless on MI's where the names are unreadable with all the gold,9

I really don't understand what is koach thinking.",7

There hasn’t even been any sixes yet has there?,2
Stupid bc Kohli should stick with spin to make sure innings is dragged till their NRR is safe.,6
Thank you Gabbar for showing up to the party.,3
We lost this at the toss,5
There is no reason for us to rush to win by 17 over and we won’t.,5
"Downvoter, your mother is a hamster and you father smells of elderberries",4

RCB should drop Kohli,8
I will upvote all comments. Fuck that downvoter cunt. Salty RCB fan,25
"Tough luck, KKR fans! This is going down to the last over.",10
RCB are bowling straight jank.,6
When you look at other teams they get a single on almost every delivery in middle overs and then there's RCB which looks clueless in the middle overs.,7
thank you SO much RCB for getting our team back into form after a terrible losing streak. Hope we keep it tight for you at the end,7
"People to blame and abuse if RCB loses at 18.2:

Padikkal   
Philippe   
Hesson   
Paschim   
Nehra   
Morris  
Siraj (for the ugly dive)   
Ashwin 


Who else?",7

Dhawan absolutely poggers. 👏,6
Isuru ffs,4

I am about to have a heart attack. Dont do it gabbar,7

Koach promptly brings Usuru back on",2
Mr Nags here deflating the comments.,5
Field placement so bad,6
It's like the bowlers are constantly trying to take a piss at the field placements,5

Bro take this match past 18th fucking over please what the fuck 😭😭😭,11
54 of 33 for KKR to qualify,10
Rahane's a great anchor for DC. He's a keeper. Shreyas should try and become more destructive with his presence in the team,9
"Okay RCB. Don't win it for the fans. ( You never really do ).

At least take the game till the 19th over! 🤦‍♂️",11
Why would Delhi want to chase this in 17.3 overs when only a win put them in top 2. no point of risking it,16
54 in 33.,4
"Hey Downvoter, Downvote me yeah ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",7
Ok can we now agree Udana has nothing to offer with the ball?,12

RCB's bowling always has been shit they depended on their batsmen and their captain and top batsman is shitting the bed and not even willing to change the way he plays in such an important match,4
58 from 33 required to knock RCB out.,4
How many fucking downvoters are there? I mean FFS why,4
Ah the downvoter(s) are here.,3

The biggest lol moment of this match has been Rahane batting at significantly better strike rate than Kohli.,5
"India has Rohit, Dhawan, Rahul, Mayank, Gill, Padikkal, Shaw and now even Rahane vying for a opener slot. Unreal depth. 

On the other hand we have Pandey, Iyer and Pant fighting for middle order spots. Talk about top heavy squad.",4
Why is every comment downvoted?,11
"RCB should understand that RCB is not Kohli.

1. Kohli is a horrible captain with simply no strategies he can think on his own.
2. Kohli unnecessarily puts pressure on other players.
3. Kohli has more enemies than friends, so all of them are always extra charged up when against Kohli to prove a point.
4. Kohli manages team selection, prolly 99% his say, no wonder team is shit.

It just hurts to be RCB fan for years now, and you know what fuck RCB till they are into this dumbass captain.",19

Thank us later RCB. You owe one now,6
is that KKR fans or RCB fans clicking that down vote button,5
No way they are scoring it in 17.3,5
28 of 11 for KKR to qualify,5
30 from 12 seems too much. looks safe to me.,4
Some dreadfully boring games lately,7
Another wicket and stoinis will ruin it for rcb,2
[I called it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jmm9u8/match_thread_55th_match_delhi_capitals_v_royal/gawm3nk/?context=3) Maybe sarcastically but I did.,7
Rahane being clutch.,7
Omg every comment is in the negatives wtf,6
"Ffs DC at least try, you have already won the match",3
Who’s fans do you think the downvoters are? My money is on Kochi Tuskers Kerala,17
Iyer don’t want his captain angry.,2
SRH fans must be loving this. Gonna play the best team of the tournament and the pressure is on other teams right now,4
Thala's team was more ruthless in one day cricket than the so called aggressive captain. Dont @ me,-5
Can’t wait for the WC celebration once the overs passes 17.3,3
Bhenchod test match khel rahe hai saare 22 log,0
"Come on guys, make this interesting.",4
"Last 10 balls all shots have gone at the same side, yet there's no fielder. Brain-dead captaincy for sure",5
[redacted],6
Thanks Iyer and Rahane. Good guys,6
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgrace_of_Gij%C3%B3n

Just leaving this here",2
You know you are an rcb fan when you have to sit through 2 borefests that is rr yesterday and dc today,5
No need to be fancy against yuzi,0
Why tf would they not have a fielder there where they're hitting every ball?,4
"Good and steady by two senior pros (Dhawan/Rahane) who took control so that the youngsters coming after them don't panic.

Knowing how inexperienced the DC youngsters are on a big match situation like this.",3
Rahane is a treat to watch. And striking better than Dhawan and Dev.,5
Iyer cementing his place for India with this knock,7
Iyer is trying hard for that Bengaluruputra award and merit points at Kohli,7
there's no way the Downvoter is supporting Mum so i can proudly say that Fuck MI,-3
[deleted],-10
DC playing for 134,6
Congratulations DC and RCB,0
Why aren't they even trying for 17.3?,4
"Thank goodness Star got the rights for the IPL. They have the Dugout and other good commentators, earlier we had to listen to Sidhu's 'Thoko thaali'",5
Congrats DC and RCB on qualifying,9
Both teams are playing it safe. Sad to see,4
No more ipl in uae please... toss decides winner shit,14
How long should RCB hold DC to make sure they dont slip below KKR,0
Tbh DC have no reason to accelerate. They are going to be no 2 anyway. And I would rather like to face RCB than KKR if there is a need to play qualifier 2. KKR are dangerously unpredictable.,7
Behenchod all I'm asking is for a boundary,2
DC can't drop Rahane anymore,4
So Moeen daddy for udana is guaranteed next game right,5
"I feel delhi will be happy if rcb qualifies and not kkr.

They will definitely go beyond 17.3.",8
We still have Washi so game will finish at like 19th over,6
All hail Padikkal's selfless innings for the winning position RCB is in now. He didn't played for any personal milestones and scored with such a brilliant strike rate that his team and it's followers will forever be thankful to him. May the higher powers bless him,9
KKR can still qualify if SRH loses right?,13
Rahane & Pujara are going to tear Lyon a new one in the BG trophy.,10
A boundary would be nice I suppose.,7
Not a good birthday gift today for SRK by DC,10
I think DC will go berserk after reaching 137,10
Delhi please dont finish it just yet,7
All this hype for who gets to be the choker in playoffs! fffs,10
Iyer doesn't want to knock RCB down,10
Ind vs eng to make pak get eliminated vibes from this...,12
Its a truce,11
Power cut here lmao. I guess the electricity guy lost his shit,8
Iyer genuinely doesn't want to piss off VK by eliminating rcb.,17
"Any team which is out of form, should ALWAYS play against RCB. They can bring dead back from the grave.",25
25 of 8 for KKR to qualify,14
"Goodbye RcB, it was fun while it lasted",3
"DC doing RCB a favour, they know RCB will be easier to defeat later",15
any guess on who does the downvoter supports?,11
I hope RCB make DC regret this. That will teach Iyer to think like his coach would have.,8
This occasion both winner and loser celebrates and the one who didn't even play gets sad.,24
Really wanted pant ahead of iyer to finish the game off early but this is probably the more sensible thing to do,8
Iyer unwilling to finish the match early and risk getting replaced by SKY in the next series.,8
"Not siraj now, please not siraj now.",11
Iyer trying to be in good terms with kohli,13
Chahal wicketless?,6
"Lol Rcb, Dc had a secret agreement",11
"Iyer already has a spot in t20 side 
 
Rahane should start hitting sixes now to fuck with koach",10
Koach promised iyer a letter of recommendation for capataincy position in return of playing slow,16
18 overs? ROFL,4
""" Did DC intentionally took it past 18th over? See I am not saying anything""- Joy Battacharya",15
25 off 8.,5
Maro bc. Wickets ka kya karoge bhosadiwalo,5
25(9) Iyer and Rahane can't do it. Bye bye KKR.,7
25 from 9. Come on guys. Free Rosogulla for all,12
Iyer No.4 slot confirmed no one is kicking u out now,8
Poor KKR fans,10
Rahane and Iyer playing as slow as possible so that RCB qualifies and they don't make Lord Koach angry.,7
Maybe KKR should have attacked more after getting like 5 wickets inside the power play. Clearly their management knew winning by 75 runs was a possibility and a playoff spot was guaranteed irrespective of SRH - MI result,8
It's not for those match winning innings by ab RCB would have been in the last place,10
"Its clear

DC wants to face RCB in qualifiers 2",12
So DC and RCB collabrates to shit over KKR,11
"Come on DC, you can hit it a bit now.",4
So RCB has to survive another 2 overs to get in,9
Except Mi all are tuktuk teams in playoffs lol. 🤗,11
"don't really care for either of these teams.

thought i'd support RCB today, guess that was the wrong choice lmao",-1
"I don't see why dc is being criticized, this would be a perfectly normal chase if all the nrr shit wasn't there",4
[removed],0
Can the downvoter fuck-off gracefully please,7
"It's time for sad boi downvotes I guess now
Literally have no life other than downvoting",-2
"This is how I wanted them to play. Just focus on our own goals and fuck the noise. Doesn't matter if it helps other team or not, 2 points is the only priority",3
Iyer playing for permanent spot in India XI.  /s,5
Tuk fucking tuk baby!!!!,0
Fuck the downvoting bot,5
Sensible from DC to not go after Chahal.,5
I swear Kohli would absolutely have gone for the kill if he had the chance to knock out formidable opponents if he was batting and faced with an equation like this.,9
come on 2 more decent overs and we are through.,4
Has any team shithoused their way into playoffs after a four match losing streak?,3
DC was about to chase this down in 17.3 but realized that RCB is so bad we can beat them again in Qualifier 2,14
What if the scores get tied on 17.3 overs and they hit the next delivery for a boundary or six?,5
Two Mumbai boys batting in blue cruising against RCB. It is in their DNA.,4
"No boundary, just one six in last 4 overs.

WTF DC, would've been fun had they chased it close to 17.3",5
All i can gather from dc's current batting state is that they would prefer rcb over kkr in the playoffs,0
"25 in 1.3 overs, KKR fans ke goti muh me hai lmao",2
"dc >>>>> rcb 

iyer >>>>> koach",0
RCB thought their fans need to be embarassed a little more and they dragged them to the playoffs.,1
9 balls 25 runs . Looks like RCB will survive only to get more embarrassed  in eliminator.,4
Dc choke pls. I am still hoping for top 2,0
"They told it's 2020 anything can happen, even a RCB winning IPL Trophy. But, 2020 was like I am gonna meme RCB even more by kicking them out of top 2 spot to straight out of playoffs lmao.",4
Delhi need 25 in how many for RCB to be unsafe,3
Fuck you IYER first and foremost,1
"Rahane and Iyer are doing the right thing.

They don't need to go full guns blazing and they probably would rather have RCB than KKR in the playoffs",10
"ARE MARO BHADWO , tumare baap ka kuch jane wala hai kya",6
"Both the teams are scared of playing MI lol.

No one wants to be @ number 2",6
"I understand that DC are playing it safe, but wouldn't you rather knock RCB out and face an iffy KKR in playoffs instead. People talking about how they win today doesn't matter to DC, but I feel it should.",9
Kohli is wearing his India shirt under the RCB one and he just flashed it to Iyer and Rahane in a threatening manner.,30
"6 runs and delhi makes it and 9 balls for rcb,seems like kkr will be in the tough spot.",5
"I cant believe people wanting us to go apeshit at it, we win we should be fucking delighted. Those 2 points are more important than some boundaries please",17
Big over please,1
"Shreyas Gopal saved us with his knock yesterday.

Thank you Shreyas 🙏",7
Wait can RCB still qualify if SRH beats MI?,6
People talking about us thinking RCB would be easier to beat as if we're not smashing MI twice to win the whole thing,3
pls ponting dont tell them to go for the kill,1
lol nice little drama before MI eventually win this IPL. they look absolutely unbeatable,7
"8 balls 25 runs to knock out RCB.


Mike Hesson with evil laugh: "" it was all the plan to let DC eliminate MI in Playoffs and win the IPL"".",12
Kohli bring siraj/morris back so kkr can qualify😂😂,6
"""I always say, Delhi is against our shonar Bangla""

- Mamta Baneerjee",7
Rahane to hit 6 4s in the next over and then iyer to finish the game in 17.4 overs for memes,7
Swanny shitshow as usual.,6
"Dc I hope u don't  win this ipl, not going after with 8 wickets in hand is frustating",8
Overall this IPL has been the competition to find which teams are least shit,8
Why does everyone here think that koach selects the national squad lol,9
Dc have proved their point I guess. I know now if they take it deep it will only be because they don't wanna piss off Koach,5
Lol swann,9
Please Mumbai. Our hopes lie with you,10
Swann just cannot catch a break in the dugout,10
"Imagine full of vengeance KKR if they still qualify on SRH losing, and then thrashing RCB in knock outs.",11
"So now RCB has to prevent them from getting 25 of the last 9.

Good luck",4
MI will shit the bed in qualifier. You heard it here 1st.,10
"I am upvoting everyone guys, support please!",9
"RCB fans, give us your blessings against MI in Q1 please",6
God this next over is so crucial,7
"Fellow Bengaluru boys, turn your attention to BFC this month, they give us plenty to cheer about. Chhetri annange ge jai _/\_",11
I don't know why I am hoping for SRH to qualify. We're like the specialist eliminator losers.,7
"I'm a simple man. I see a downvoted comment, I upvote. Deploy the UPVOTE army!",12
KKR fans must be raging after watching these two bat like this,8
MI flairs accounts shitting on rcb and now on dc.....i may hate csk and our own but you have the most toxic fans,2
"Stop bitching people, every team wants to make it to playoffs. They will play accordingly.",11
Bruh RCB lost 4 in a row and still in playoffs lmao,11
Why do I have a feeling that DC will chase this in exactly 17.3 overs?,6
Good from Delhi to just focus on them as it should not bother them even .1% which other team qualifies or not. Top 2 and if somehow they win that match straight into finals.  Much bigger goal that than just to try and put RCB in some odd position.,4
Brian Lara is great person,12
"Can DC do us a favour and pull off an SRH? :P

When SRH lost the match from a position even my gully team would've won.",5
Now that win is confirmed plz go for it DC,1
DC focused on positive by winning the game comprehensively. Rather than focused on kicking out RCB that's a negative approach.,7
"In the hindsight , csk had the most stress free ipl.",11
"What if the strategy changes during the timeout, and Rahane-Iyer come back going hell for leather.",0
RCB will face either a peaking KKR or SRH in the playoffs.,5
Brian Lara is too competitive even in the dugout guru race. Champion mentality,8
Lara is such a snob in the dugout lol I love it.,9
Swanny should just stick to advertising Altroz lol,7
"Have teams been using the Time Out strategically, in general? Or just letting time run out until they are forced to take it?",7
Lara is by far the most knowledgeable pundit there.,4
"Any new fan looking at kohli's on,off field personality and stats would think he's an absolute chad. But only we die hard fans know he's a meme

He's a meme but he's our meme",7
"1. There is a global pandemic raging on.
2. There is a global recession in the making.
3. The elections in US might make or mar the world for the next few years.
4. The planet is warming up at rates unseen before.
5. The camera then pans towards the Tata Altroz.
6. For a few moments, everything is perfect in Swanny's little world.",13
25 runs in 1.3 overs,3
"Why even use udana if u already have 3 other pacers who have done much better than him, the only time that he would do well was against csk because of the slow pitch and yall didn’t use him.",4
Did anyone notice how Hetmeyer hugged Rahane during the timeout? Like he wanted him to succeed badly. It was beautiful.,3
iyer : rcb ko knockouts main bulaake aur ek baar haraunga. inhe kya hi pata chalega.,3
Rcb is going to get knocked out in eliminator.,1
"do y'all have an IPL team you don't like for no reason?

edit: for me it's KKR and DC. no idea why, i respect the players just don't support the teams for no reason lmao",7
[coincidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jmm9u8/match_thread_55th_match_delhi_capitals_v_royal/gawqakb?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)? I think not,3
Okay come come on 8 balls,1
You need to understand that we have a 3 match losing streak. Why to fuck with RCB when it doesn't really matter? Just win and that is enough,8
So Iyer and Koach discussed about delaying till 17.4 in the strategic timeout?,4
DONT DO THIS SHAHBAZ NO MORE WIDES,4
"Wow 2 extra wins and csk would have been in playoff I thought they where worst team this year but looks like competition on it from other team is strong.

How the hell is RR in last place",4
God I hate rahane so much,-1
not even a single boundary in past 3 overs. And I thought DC were the good guys 😭,4
Kohli-Iyer deal made.,8
Why Iyer why... Wtf,4
All KKR fans have joined in the serial downvoting cult,2
"Lol. There is a decent chance RCB qualifies before DC. DC need 143 and if they have less than 143 at 17.3, RCB qualifies first.",3
fuck not iyer he was playing for us,8
"Pant please kick out RCB, take your revenge for being dropped",2
Chutiya sidhe ball daal na.,2
GOOD RIDDANCE. FUCK YOU IYER.,10
Tuk tuk Iyer departs,7
"Fuck, stoinis in.. Rcb fucked now",8
Get fucked Iyer lol.,5
Rahane really showed in class in the middle order stabilized the innings really,11
Bring in Axar no joke he’ll win it within 2 overs.,7
Get fucked Iyer lol.,9
[removed],12
Shreyas Iyer not wanting to piss off koach there,10
"25 off 9*

Rahane should pull DK of Nidahas trophy in here!!",11
KKR fans in bliss rn,10
Not bad for rcb bois to get 3/4 spot... DC clearly played better cricket in this season.,11
Ffs iyer 🤦,6
oh dear that was a mistake. should have kept iyer in.....,7
"Iyer that has to be single dumbest move that you could have done. When you have to accelerate then do this shit, what is wrong with you",4
"Well, now KKR will be praying for SRH loss. Frankly, only KKR can beat MI",5
Dc are not gonna choke this right? Lol,4
How incompetent you have to be to play like this,5
This seems dumb.,8
RCB Agent Iyer,10
I’d really like to see Pant take it from here,6
Nothing shot. Punter will be absolutely furious.,5
Ada pongada,7
Watch stoinis knock us out,6
Shreyas next India captain confirmed.,6
Can SRH win tomorrow and still finish 5th?,5
why can't iyer play good cricket,8
Atleast iyer tried to fuck rcb,7
Ngl I'm happy Shreyas got out. Need power shots,7
COME ON PANT TAKE YOUR REVENGE PLSS,6
Why would u do that iyer,8
Thanks for coming Iyer. What in this world.,5
Idiotic from Iyer,4
Lifeline for KKR?,6
Rcb’s best chance is the duo here; they really take it deep - rahane and iyer who else can you ask for,5
"Who is Shahbaz Ahmed lol?

Looking good",8
So they really want to finish it in 17.3,9
"Haha, if not for Rahane, DC could seriously lose this match.",7
PANT COME IN AND SMASH PLEASE,4
Damn stoinis hates rcb,3
Both of these teams are more deserving than KKR tbh,8
Iyer brain fading faster than Kohli.,3
For other KXIP fans: when will you change the flair?,6
Lol. Iyer,5
DC do a KXIP. I feel this match just has life in.,2
All Iyer had to do was tuck tuk... chutiya,4
"Kal RR ka ko haal hua, isliye shayad aaj DC ne jyada risk nahi liya.",3
~~PS5~~ No.4 spot secured,4
Shreyas (Gopal and Iyer) fucking KKR over.,3
Where was this boy shehbaz all this long in the atonement,7
"The IPL really is one of the best competitions in all of sport. When you look at the table, on paper the squad of the team in first place isn’t really that much better than the team in last place. It’s simply an even field playing field where anyone can beat anyone. 

As someone that’s a football fan first, the system of squad building and transfers in the IPL is so much more satisfying than football’s self perpetuating cycle of inequality.",10
Iyer #4 spot confirmed,6
Downvoting bot creator mom is a hoe.,4
"This is so unfortunate for KKR. RCB and DC knew the stakes beforehand, this match was always going to be a boring as fuck unless one of the teams completely capitulated.",7
Mr. Overrated gone with a stupid shot.,6
Iyer shamelessly throwing this game so that Kohli picks him in tests.,7
"Why cant Iyer hit boundaries along the ground 

he always lofts and it's a big ass six or out",6
Bc Iyer is a chutiya,9
Pant do it,1
"Shreyas Iyer ya cunt, you tried to finish the match before 17.3 overs didn't you?",7
"I’m not even commenting anymore, what’s up with all the downvotes?",4
This would've been such a classy victory with just 2 wickets given,3
Siraj shouldve dropped it,4
Thanks Iyer for the intent. We will remember this.,9
The one time Iyer chooses to hit big...,4
Is it the beginning of a choke?,3
Iyer came just to ensure Rcb qualification. Did his job.,7
Bhenchod DC,6
Okay here it is 7 balls 23,2
"Come on DC!!, are you gonna take singles till eternity?",2
Iyer henceforth gets honorary RCB quota,3
Iyer with a motm knock in Kohli's eyes.,5
"**16.2** Shahbaz Ahmed to Iyer, OUT, **drags it straight to long-on.** Good length and holding in the pitch outside off. Reaches out and looks to clear the straight boundary. It comes off the inside half **130-3**

SS Iyer c Mohammed Siraj b Shahbaz Ahmed 7 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 77.77",3
Pant play your natural game and win this before 17.3,1
"8 more balls bois. You can do it!


Don't choke now. Just 8 more balls.",1
Scenes if now DC gets all out at 133.,5
Rishab looking fatter day by day.,1
"Rahane chutiya, tune bich me atleast try kiya hota toh it would have been great bhadwe",-1
RCB fanbois coming up with downvotes,2
chonker pant arriv.,2
Fuck DC,6
Fuck should have stayed till end of innings now I'm scared of Stoinis & Pant they both hate us,7
Both teams know now that they will be in top 4. Will play more attacking now specially RCB.,7
"But more importantly, it was a dot ball",8
"It's good that RCB is qualifying(thanks to Shreyas), but can dc win IPL, I mean look how MI plays.",9
"Wow, some serious downvote winds blowing in this sub ;-p
Trying my best to counter by upvoting. Probably will be downvoted to hell :)",15
Inb4 Pant emulates thala and takes this to the 20th,11
Iyer 12th man. Thanks ree 🥳🥳,4
pant pls hit,4
wow what a shit shot,7
Rishabh Pant will get out for a duck,5
"Bro how tf is Lenskart still around?


They sell glasses for dirt cheap and STILL their stores are always empty",5
Very cool DC. Thank you.,10
So IPL is a tourney where 7 teams battle each other to meet Mi in the final and lose to them? Pretty much sums up.,7
How much are Dugout experts paid? Just wondering.,5
Which team will be more bothered  if RCB loses this match only by small margin? SRH or KKR,9
"8 more balls, come one just survive",4
How can rcb play such pathetic cricket in such an important game? Now need to win 3 in a row. Too tough,4
Shahbas Shahbaz. You saved RCB with your spell,2
The choke begins,4
Ayeee pant wants to tuk tuk toooo,3
"Happy even after losing, sad even after qualifying

Only RCB fans can experience this",8
How weak a squad will mi play tomorrow?,2
17/7 incoming?,5
Pant please tuk tuk,8
RCB is in Playoffs cause they didn't pick Steyn today. Even if Morris is not fit please don't play Steyn and bring back Moen and hope Saini is fit 🤞,4
"I wonder who's downvoting this match of ""Indian"" Premier League",12
"Dc , could have sent hetmyer ??
Just to make it interesting.",3
"Let's switch the meaning of upvote and downvote till this serial downvoter stops. If you agree with / like some comment, downvote it",3
Test batsman and test batsman at the crease. Their partnership will be legendary!!,4
Will Kohli celebrate after 17.3?.,4
Pant is getting fatter by the day my god,4
FML. That should have been a tactical drop. Pant will no bonkers and end this shit before 17.3 or 18.3 or whatever the fuck.,3
Surely even Delhi can't screw it up from here.,5
Qualified bitches,3
" T20 ISN'T FOR IYER

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

Today's poll

Most exciting DC player

Who won?

Shreyas freking iyer with 44% Yeah very exciting singles",10
How long has it been since a boundary? I've felt myself age.,4
1 run more and Delhi are through,4
DC choke?,1
Scenes if someone takes hattrick here... lol,4
Thala comes in,4
Rishabh Pant looking like my favourite actor Mohanlal,3
waiting for Kohli’s expression at 17.3 overs,9
If rahane gets out can dc choke??,3
Iyer another overrated underachieving Indian batsman. There are about a dozen of them,2
Just a fodder for MI...thats what DC is...RCB too...the way these both teams played this match,9

Who's Kavitha in the RCB camp?,11
BC who is down voting everything.,12
Hottake: DC is not winning quickly because they'd rather have RCB lose in the playoffs.,10
Responsible Pant will only be accepted for this match,2
"Thank you, Shahbaz.",7
Did someone tell Pant this is pro kabaddi,3
Believe in Rahane,3
What does this mean for KKR?,7
"Saini and Morris both are injured now, its umesh yadav next game. That 2% chance of winning IPL is 0% now.",7
[deleted],3
"Yeahhhh, rcb is safe",6
RCB should think of winning this from here.,5
Okay one single here and we are in,6
"Stick to the commentary, Mr. Brian Lara.

You shouldn't be giving batting tips to anyone lol. Especially left-handers.",-4
Hattrick sixes?,3
"BC rasgulla ppl, calm down. Stop downvoting everything.",3
RCB would have won this easily if koach had won the fucking toss.,5
Holy shit Padikkal is younger than me. I'm finally at that age where not an insignificant number of players are younger than me and it sucks so much,16
Congrats RCB you qualified despite a choke,8
Pant's batting is one of the ugliest sights.,5
Shabaz thank you boi,8
"Watch DC getting fucked outta table tomorrow when SRH beats MI, then you'll going to know, fucken Iyer 🙄🙄",2
RCB can technically qualify before DC,11
Pant gonna go for 3 sixes in next 3 balls he faces,8
"The only team benefitting for their captain resigning midway, could be RCB.",15
20 of 4 balls,5
RCB did it lol.,15
"pant mc follow ur own advice

dont forget ""EASY EASY EASY""",11
Feel sad for KKR. They don't deserve to go out like that.,10
Dc will win from the last ball,5
RIP KKR,7
Rcb in playoffs Hell yeah,6
Saved Chahal for death?,4
Well bowled Ahmed. 👍🏻,6
DC officially qualified with 134 :),11
"134 achieved for us. 

17.3 guaranteed for RCB.",10
And KKR is now completely dependent on SRH,10
Don't lose a wicket. Gain some form here,3
134 runs and 17 overs achieved simultaneously,3
So KKR only hope will be MI win right?,3
"Rahane scoring @ >120 SR
Pant showing intent early

Wtf has happened to DC?",4
I want the Rcb team to celebrate like the won the cup after bowling the 17.4 ball,4
"OKAY BOYS WE ARE THROUGH 


we don't deserve it but i hope we pull thru",5
Should have sent in stoinis. He would've delivered what we all were hoping for,3
RCB guaranteed qualification,4
We really are a shameless franchise man. Time and again getting into the final stages because of others' incompetence.,1
I imagine KKR players throwing abuses at Iyer and Ponting right now,6
Congrats RCB,3
Sundar pls,6
Punter wont keep calm knowing Delhi can bottle this,5
Looks like there is a secret agreement between DC and RCB. Thoughts?,4
DC to play us in the 2nd qualifiers we first have to win the eliminator,4
"God damn-it, made me emotional

https://twitter.com/lionsdenkxip/status/1323308896782602244?s=19",8
Get fucked kkr.,0
KKR TO MI please please please please,4
How many balls does rcb need to save now ??,2
17.3 incoming,3
"Fun Fact- if it's 1 to win and a six is hit on 18.1 overs, we still fall below KKR which would be peak RCB",9
Why are the staff giving each other high fives for sealing an eliminator spot?,8
"Do you think saini would have done better than Udana ?

Maybe then the match was closer",1
Ayeeeee RCB into play offs LMAO,3
Rahane being a loyal vice captain.,2
Both have qualified now,1
"I just hope this leads to a simultaneous last round discussion. Whether or not there's a collusion, the problem is the current system allows collusion to happen.",2
Not for nothing but DC lost a match to KXIP last year from a similar situation,0
KKR's chances are practically over.,0
Both RCB and DC are in qualifiers,1
Playing 3 spinners paid off.,1
So RCB have qualified provided there are no no balls or wide right?,1
"So, DC have finally qualified for the playoffs. Don't see them winning this match tho",1
"I am ready for ""we were 20 runs short"" speech from Koach",9
"Should have put in Stoinis instead of Pant.

Pant is highly likely to tuk tuk away and waste 12 balls.",1
"bc delhi, we will se you in qualifier 1.",3
"RCB 🤝 DC

🤗 Jhappi time",4
Memes are the real losers tonight : ( .,2
DC has qualified for Play-offs!! Arre nacho bhenchod,5
"""10 ball pe 25 nahi bana paye behnchod IPL khelne aaye ho? Jab hum tumhari umar ke thay toh bat pe spring laga ke chhakke lagate thay"" ~ Ponting in dressing room",2
And that's it. Mi to play a full strength squad tomorrow to make sure kkr qualify,0
Shahbaz actually has a better spell than Chahal,3
DC Still have 18.1 overs to get 158. But it would be difficult with the way Rahane is playing.,2
So both of them have qualified,4
GG DC and RCB . Hope we win tomorrow,2
4 sixes let's go,-1
SRH vs MI finals would be good to watch,6
"K guys downvotes to upvote

And if you don't like something, upvote it",1
we live to die anther day,2
HUM ~~JEET~~ QUALIFY HO GAYEEEEEEE,5
Shahbaz Ahmed is the man of the match for me,2
Fuck DC just hoping they lose frm here n we get to cunt them in eliminator,-4
Most undeserved play off qualifiers ever,-3
KKR will live another day to test their luck!!!,1
Both teams are shit but kkr has been shittier.,4
So only KKR will be rooting against us?! Fair..,3
Pant after becoming mature too get retained in test squad but loosing space in LOIs : i won but at what cost?,2
DC you had to do one thing,3
I don't get why kkr fans gotta stress srh game hasn't be played yet they still have chance,3
fuck dc for not destroying like csk bro fuck Iyer,3
Watch Delhi lose from here,4
You guys should be embarrassed to congratulate RCB for shitting their way into the playoffs.,5
KKR is downvoting here. Not RCB. We RCB fans are used to this every year. We shit on our own team,4
"What did Kohli say to the bowler after Iyer's wicket? 

""Shahbaz Nadeem""

Thank you for attending my TED talk.",12
0 boundaries in the last 28 balls lol,5
What a dull game this is turning out to be. Only positive is we RR fans got to see some of those sweet Rahane shots.,4
"With all RCBians shitting about that 17.3 mark, it would be mental if DC ends up choking and losing from here :)",3
"Everybody acting like KKR is already out of the tournament! They know that, if MI wins tomorrow, KKR retain the 4th spot. Right????",7
Does 3 six suffice? Or rcb is guaranteed now,7
:(,6
wide and 3 sixes anyone?,1
We have qualified :))))))),5
Delhi qualify if they scored another 5 right?,2
5 more balls guys,2
We needed a Remember the Name kinda moment for some fun now but it's Rahane batting :(,3
RCB should thank KKR for that NRR. 😂,3
It's funny to think that the only reason why one of RCB and DC stood at a chance of breaking their losing streak ahead of the playoffs is because it is impossible under the rules of the game for two teams to lose in a match.,4
Who the fuck is downvoting everything ?,7
Iyer confirmed to play for India till Koach resigns,1
Lmao DC is faking the task 👀,4
"I'm just wondering if DC is taking it slow because of the position they're in today, or if this is just how they'll play even in the upcoming matches",2
Congrats again to both teams. Truly deserve it ;),6
Lucky RCB,1
DC have qualified officially.,4
[Called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jmm9u8/match_thread_55th_match_delhi_capitals_v_royal/gawk34m?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),4
Kkr fans now hate iyer for his 7(9),9
Rich qualifying in the most rcb way,3
"Every one is counting a win tomorrow for srh already. Lol, Warner himself won't be so sure about that.",3
I'm expecting RCB players to celebrate on the third ball lol,7
Here comes Maxwell's academy of naam bde or darshan chote,5
KKR and SRH will have to wait till tomorrow now to qualify.,4
"are y'all kkr fans really that confident that srh will win tomorrow?

\- coming from an srh fan",8
So RCB qualifies inspite of losing this match ?,7
They just forgot boundaries,7
NAACHO BC,5
thank you dc ❤,12
DC is through woohoo,9
"All here saying DC and rcb don't deserve to be playoffs, then so do srh and kkr. They too played shit cricket",20
Rahane with intent.,6
So the best bowler of the day for RCB does not bowl out. Seriously Kohli wtf?,3
Mumbai will stream roll through any of these teams lmao,8
MOTM Shaabaz Nadeem for saving our asses,11
The downvoter guy needs attention because nobody in real life gives him... We all mentioning about him is the highlight of his day...,9
Why rahane lol,8
What's Dan Bilzerian doing in RCB dougout Lmao,5
Collusion,5
RCB need a Sam Curran rn,3
Is there a twist in the tale.,6
17 off 16 seems WAY too close. Surely we need a few boundaries rn?,10
"Dc qualified Ig. But bad batting in the last few games. Good if we land up top 2 we can get one more chance.
But that means facing MI twice:( to win",8
LETS GO BOYS WE QUALIFY,8
Rahane trying to be cute.,4
Both Rahane and Dhawan got out in the same way. Urghh,5
"Congratulations everyone, this has been mind boggingly hard on us but we have somehow gotten over the line. Obviously as I type this Rahane is out",11
Choke choke choke,5
wtf was that shot,5
"Make 50, play stupid shot, get out",7
Is there a nicer guy playing cricket than Jinx? Dude has zero attitude and was well aware he has not performed. Ponting knows he is class and the look what the faith has done. DC romping into the top 2 now because of him.,7
B R U H,4
Sed noises for kkr fans.,10
Dc we just asked the 4th position not 2nd lol,17

"Oi RCB, DC held on to their end of the deal, now don't you betray them",8
I've always acted soo oblivious to the skore ad in front of my dad that today is literally the very first time I've seen the full ad. I know I'm not the only one lol,1
"Lol, fixers or chokers?",5
Stoinis now. Shit,4
THIS IS A LEGENDARY BATTLE OF THE CHOKERS,4
Oh my fuckin god we’re choking,4
Let's not let this distract us away from really disciplined show from Shahbaz!,6
Seriously? This doesn't even feel like a professional match,3
Lmao Rahane can't make this up,1
Qualified so what? Performance nodi allu baruthe,7
"Oh ho ho. DC have confirmed qualification, now they're gonna have a little choke",9
Fuck off Iyer you wet flannel took everything away from KKR,2
DC are going to choke again???,5
DC vs RCB giving us what we expected from DC vs RCB,13
What a stupid way to get out,3
Ok how is Sams as a batsman. I have a feeling he's gonna bat today.,7
DC have qualified no worries for them now qualification was important no one's winning against MI.,10
Fuck off RCB and dc.,6
This thread has more salt than what Gandhi made at Dandi,25
"Lol, lol. The shitshow nevers ends",9
Need chris morros,8
i just cant see how mumbai doesnt end up winning the title. all these other teams are so flawed,8
Bc DC don't lose from here! KKR still out though.,13
It'll be interesting if RCB squeezes a few dot balls now....,9
Inb4 choke,11
You can't make this shit up.,6
DC doing an RCB against RCB,13
"If RCB wins , I download CRED.",14
Fuck! Why did koach bowl udana that over. It would have been more interesting now.,6
If you downvote this you are gay.,5
Guys upvote me to piss off the downvoter,20
fking borefest after dhawan got out.,12
Every one talking about 17.3 but no one realized that DC can still bottle it from here lol,9
"So, safe to say we've qualified, right?",11
"wait so KKR are not eliminated yet, right? As long as Mumbai beats SRH tomorrow?",6
Has Koach/Noach analysis ever been done?,2
"**17.2** Washington Sundar to Rahane, OUT, **steered straight to short third.** Short of a length and across middle stump. Tries to use the angle to play the reverse lap. It comes off the top edge and is an easy take. Rahane's put them on the brink, can't take them over **136-4**

AM Rahane c Dube b Washington Sundar 60 (46b 5x4 1x6) SR: 130.43",2
Come on just win please. I wont be able to sleep if you lose from here,5
RCB might even win this. Wow. DC in the first half of the tournament was a completely different team.,3
Karma for whatever you did to our reserve team KXIP hopefully,6
yaar agar dc yahan choke karta hai then they don't deserve playoffs,2
It's so clear. It's a super over.,4
"ponting to his assistants : jaake belt ready karo,aaj ladko ko ek paath padaana hai.",3
I don't trust any of these chuds to even make Mumbai sweat,1
Well what was the runs margin now?,6
"actually a 6,6,4,0,6 will still take rcb out of contention rn",3
1 more BALL,4
RCB 🤝 DC 🤝 MI. Let's goooo,5
Come on 2 more sundar,5
"Damn I saw 11 straight comments with -1 upvotes, wtf?",6
Not sure why either Dhawan and Rahane had to play those inventive shots?,3
Both teams playing to prove who is the biggest choker HAHA,3
"We qualify, but at what cost😔",5
Scenes if DC chokes this chase xd,7
Will DC repeat what they did against us last year?,2
Reminder that KKR vs SRH was decided by a super over,6
Lmao DD,4
why did you choke rr and kings11 wmiss you for the drama,2
"Only teams that can give MI some competition are KXIP, RR and SRH.",2
Mumbai is our last hope. Don't rest anyone against SRH please.,5
[deleted],8
JFYI the target is 158 for 18.1 overs,5
"Let's take a moment to appreciate how none of the DC batsmen have bothered to see this chase through.

Just gifting wickets all around",10
Iyer has been trash this IPL outside that innings vs KKR,8
Shoot one out,3
"My bad, DC will find it hard to win against a peaking KKR or SRH.",5
We're in bois,7
Fucking hell.,3
"CEAT prefers to sponsor mumbai batsman more than anyone, Rohit Rahane Iyer",3
gl shivam dube,2
Rahane is such a introvert cricketer.,8
Both teams today deserve to go to hell..lmao,5
"The ""Vi"" sounds demonic.",7
RCB fans glad Stoinis did not come out earlier.,8
Totally unnecessary shot. Fuck this shot. Fuck the urge for this shot.,4
whos the big bearded dude in rcb dugout?,3
"Yessss let's goooooooo, thank you so much DC",12
Challenging himself to play funky shots when you're set and the job is done. Because ones and twos are too easy and done-and-dusted. Sachinesque,7
Who is that guy next to Morris?,3
I wanted both KKR and SRH to Qualify,6
"You cant choke this,BC",4
This match is literally between two losers to get one winner. Epic ain't it,6
So both teams qualify?,4
stoinis imma need you to go hulk mode today. do it for warnie. do it for zampa,3
WE QUALIFY!!!,6
can't choke this surely with ashwin finisher,1
Just realized: Jaddu hit a six when csk needed 1 off 1 against KKR. 5 runs extra that KKR conceded.,8
Will both the teams get a Q now or will th 3rd team have to wait till tomorrow?,3
Scriptwriters trying to bring so many plot twists has started becoming a little infuriating,8
Bruh don't give me panic attack,0
stoinis ko toh dekha hi nahi aaj,1
Where is this downvote brigade coming from?,4
MOTM for RCB = Dhawan's paddle sweep,3
"It's official: DC and RCB have qualified. Winner will go to top 2.

Tomorrow:
SRH wins, they qualify.
Any other scenario, KKR qualifies.",11
TBH I only have faith in SRH to topple MI. These two just find chances out of the blue to bottle. KKR against MI is just lol.,6
Boot up the RCB qualification party thread,6
So after how many years are RCB seeing playoffs?,2
"Ah classic dc vs rcb, both never disappoint",5
GG RCB !!! WE ARE IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!,9
RCB has qualified for Play-offs!! Arre nacho bhenchod,8
Fixed by both team after 1st Inning?,3
This is a proper 2nd place playoff now. No other bullshit to care about,3
Apparently if DC hit 3 sixes in a row RCB still go below KKR,6
DC just love making things difficult for themselves. Bizarre team,2
"Finally, FFS",1
"We talk about Shaw getting to be made Murga, but Iyer actually should be made Murga",3
"Come RCB Bois

Let's take a moment and thank KKR for helping us reverse our negative RR. Our boy Shreyas Gopal for helping us through yesterday. Tuk Tuk Rahane and 12th man Iyer for helping us.

Next sala cup Namdhe 💪💪",6
Shreyas is a Kohli cockholster confirmed!,1
"Problem with KKR is that when they shit the bed, they dont just shit they also spread it all over the bed. 

Any other team with a 60 runs win in their last match would have been sitting pretty tonight with same points, but not KKR.",7
Okay so now it's 17.3. What does that mean?,1
SORRY VIRAT I AM A FOOL,2
Ez clap for rcb,0
"RIP to those who actually downloaded CRED! They're going to steal all your financial, income, and spending data.",7
Chokers doing what they are expected to do,4
Story of 2 teams - one led by the current Indian captain and another led by the guy touted as future Indian captain. I am scratching my head to figure out who is more shittier.,22
So Delhi is thru to the finals right,0
"If Koach is real, he’ll bowl himself in the final over",7
"Well we've done boys RCB is into the playoffs.   
\- Iyer",2
Yes RCB second team to qualify... yeaa..,7
Scenes if dc bottles this.,8
"Stoinis reminded me we have zampa in our squad lmao, where he at",5
Stoinis just needs to remember he used to play for RCB and then we'll win,10
Can we still win,4
KKR can't blame anyone but themselves if they are out. They are the one who shat themselves against RCB and gave them NRR advantage.,5
Jaise loha lohe ko kat ta hai wese choker hi choker ko marega na,3
"Don't Iyer, Rahane know that its a run a ball? I will never understand the psychology behind reverse and aerial hits when they are not needed..",3
Woohoooooooo Moral Victory virtually qualified. Best season after 2016 what else do you want.,6
I love both teams so definitely happy,0
Pant had three balls for a moment there... Lol,7
Wtf is this galli cricket shot by pant lmao,2
"Fuck!! Looking at both KKR and SRH dunno who's gonna qualify for the playoffs.
IMO both teams shoulda been qualified #feelsbadman 😭😭",1
Abey 4 maaro bhadwon you need 16 in 2.,2
So both rcb and dc qualified ?,3
6 more balls for RCB?,1
wtf has happened to my boy Pant,1
Calm down guys KKR can still qualify if mi wins tomorrow.,8
Lmao,0
Sab me sab naacjo bhencho,4
What's the implication of this match now? who's through?,2
That was dick before wicket,5
Bourgeoisie Shreyas and his men trying their best to knock commies (KKR) out of the tournament,7
LETS GO RCB!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥,3
RIP RISHAB'S BALLS,3
Super over now please,4
"We. Are. In

Gonna lose the eliminator tho lol",8
Okay NOW we are thru phew.,4
Rahane and Dhawan have done their job really well... ab bas choke na karde ab,11
This is not billiards pant!,2

FFS please don't bottle this,5
"Jeez! I wish I were that ball. 

Stuck between Rishabh Pant's thicc, meaty, sweaty thighs.",4
There will be elite scenes if DC bottles this.,7
RIP KKR,0
[redacted],3
"FYI, Stoinis and Riccardo are friends",5
Iyer is Kohli part 2 this tournament.. sucks the momentum and can't hit big when needed..,6
"Pretty disappointed that we won’t get a meme elimination. Regardless, for their first half alone, both teams deserve to be in the qualifiers. 

Won’t be surprised if SRH make it to play offs though. Mumbai are in a good form but likely we might see a couple of players being rested and SRH in good form as well. 

DC still look pretty beatable so MI remain favorites for Q1",3
I can see everyone abusing Pant if we don't win it from here.,12
MI imma need you to do us a solid tomorrow,6
Absolute scenes if Delhi bottle this or if this ends up being a superover.,8
Pls 2nd spot is very valuable to us,5
"One magical over and you never know, DC might have taken it too deep",9

Some rouge KKR fan having a downvote party,3
I can totally see dc losing it from here,5
Siraj 2-0-13-1 and never bowled a 3rd over,2
Inb4 RCB and DC have a choke-off.,6

Excuse the salt but the entire fucking game looked mutually scripted on field like that fifa WC game long time ago,-3
Oh shoot. KKR xan still qualify if MI win.,6
"I m sure SRH will win tomorrow 

MI has mastered the art of breaking KKR fans hearts",6
Dc gonna choke,0
Delhi started playing like Delhi,2
"Facing RCB in QF1, we hope ABD doesn't get into form.",4

We need atleast one boundary,2
We qualify. Another disappointment promised,3
Nervous now since it's the pacers for these last two.,2
"RCB QUALIFICATION PARTYY

AFTER 4 LONG YEARS",6
Just wanna see DC fail to score 1 from 3,3
Can Morris bowl both the overs please? Lol,3
ohohohoho after being dominated for 90% of the game smh,2
"Keep the playoff qualifications out, this match is shit af",7
"DC doing the most DC thing and r/cricket frustrated over the downvoter doing their usual nonsense. 

Things are returning to normal.",8
"2 overs, 15 needed.

DC choking away...",4
very nice over from washi,3
Rcb qualify for playoffs bois,8
Giving me memories of kkr vs kxip..,7
"I thought kxip was doing an RCB this season, DC is doing their hardest to do an RCB from last 5 matches.",5
Iyer came in and did not finish the match. What a useless leader!!,7
DC is qualified irrespective of the result.,9
DC fuckers pls don't choke,4
Wish we had saini-morris,6
WE QUALIFIED YESSSS RCB IN PLAYOFFS BABY,3
Kohli turned into Pant there for a sec,1
Bowl AB!,1
🍾🍾🍾🍾,-1
If RCB wins this match I'll take up no nut November!!,1
One wicket in the next over will turn the match around. Come on Boys!!,3
What DC need rn is Axar the finisher's big dick energy,2
"I swear if these fuckers bottle it, all the bowlers should make them all lined up and spank all of them individually.",8
Where is Morris when you need him.,1
Hahahah wtf. Still in this boys.,3
Imagine DC toppling now lol,0
Is that Dan Bilzerian lol?,5
"This is a game of You scratch my back and I scratch your's .

Both qualified now. 3 qualifiers decided now. MI, DC, RCB.

Toss up between SRH and KKR now. All in SRH's hands.",7
Looks like both Stoinis and Pant aren't able to time the ball very well. Tricky times.,2
RCB 🤝DC best friends,3
Rcb is that guy in the project who did nothing but still gets a pat on the back because his teammates did very well.,4
15 from 12 seems difficult guys,1
DC PLEASE CHOKE,4
That purple cap graphic is horrific,4
Thank you Ponting for asking Iyer and Co to slow down to let RCB qualify instead of KKR,5
"Thank you dc thank you very much

Even if anybody forget I certainly won't for a long time",4
Pant with his test match innings,2
"If DC ends up losing this, I am afraid Ponting is going to strangle someone.",3
When does the reverse jinxing begin for us guys?,2
To all saying goodbye to KKR...remember SRH have to beat MI tomorrow for that to happen. KKR are still favorites to finish in the top 4 given that dynamic.,2
Both have qualified right? gg,3
Lol Udana for the last over. Good luck RCB.,0
RCB doesnt have any good bowlers left tho,3
Atleast KKR was an exciting team. RCB is uninspiring team. Sad as a neutral :(,2
I really set myself up for this one... dc finding multiple ways to let me down,2
DC batsmen lack a killer instinct. Their bowlers are more aggressive,2
Surely not right?,3
Siraj going to bowl 15 wides down leg,1
Some serious inflate deflate stratergy by rcb.,5
Scenes of DC bottle this,3
both these teams gonna be garbabe in playoffs.. its Mumbai again.. fuck everyone and everything... ughhhhhh..,10
Death over Siraj is here!!,4
Siraj will end this here worry not,5
that was 2 wides,4
If DC chokes they don't deserve even qualifying.,9
"Without the terrible bowling from Morris and Udana, its possible that we could have won this game. Maybe a few runs short but at least it would have been close. Regardless, I'm glad both of us qualified :)",7
This is the same plot as the match SRH bottled against Punjab,6
Alright now win this bois,8
DC bottled up the chase...,3
"Srh ain't lising tomorrow cause mi will test their bench strength 
It's over for us",6
Pant to Rahane: Why did you left me in this situation?,5
FUCK SAKE SIRAJ,6
Qualified yay!,5
[removed],2
Both teams are playing for top 2 spot now. They are both qualified.,2
I can't explain Pant's batting,3

Smash it this over you dumb fucks!!,1
"Damn, RR has 2 wooden spoons lmao",3
"From finishing until 17.2 overs to needing 17 of 2 overs, we have come a long way",6
Neither of these two teams are going to beat MI in the play-offs with their current form. No chance.,9
What this means is that all the twists and turns during the last week have been undone. The top stay at the top :'(,4
"KKR fans supporting MI tomorrow only to get eliminated by them in playoffs. 

IPL is cruel lmao",11
What happened to Saini btw? Injured?,1
Damn RR finished both bottom of the points table and the fair play award. Tough,3
RCB and DC qualifying together. Just 2020 things,6
Has Pant middled a single ball this season.,8
ffs no wides please,1
DC and RCB >>>> KKR and SRH considering how they've played this IPL.,7
Siraj paying back the kindness.,2
DC playing like they returned from a week-long bender,8
Why do I support this team?,1
It's painful seeing Pant struggle like this.,3
Danny acknowledging that the script exists😳,1
"I am saying it now, both this teams will not be in Final.",3
Ameer khan casually cheating on wife with Shalu.,4
Try to finish it in this over itself,1
"conspiracy if  DC chokes this chase - 

Koach, Rahane & Iyer ne maandwali kar li hai",2
Pant has no fucking timing,5
Why siraj? Wtf? Why isn't udana bowling 19th?,3
So.. Udana to ball the last over?,5
Scenes if Stoinis gets out...,4
1 boundary yar bas ek,4
Pants timing is ugly af,2
[deleted],0
Can kkr still qualify?,1
How much can RCB defend in the last over? 6?,1
Siraj to bowl 14 wides.,2
"So far RCB fans were asking for DC to take game farther than 17.3, now they are wishing for DC to choke, lol",1
Morris is injured right?,2
Loser will gets to play another knockout match,1
Party cap on boys!,2
Sad KKR noises.,1
Don't care about winning now aren't gonna win against MI either really happy to qualify,2
If these guys fuck up Rahane's and Dhawan's hard work lol,3
Inside part of iyer brain is made of fear for Koach and outside part is made of team selection. All he had to do is drag it to 17.3 overs. That's the secret why RCB qualified. Ponting won't check bcoz Koach=BCCI=PIG3 so won't respect them. MI will win. Koach threatened iyer with selection but their daddy Pollard will be back,6
Please one boundary. Aren't these the hitters. Do a safe grounded shot,3
Surely I'm not the only one who picked up DC deliberately slowed down these last few overs?,5
Just sucked all the joy out even if they win from here,6
Moeen!,2
Abe dilli chutia what is u doin,2
Both teams are playing for the other to win.,1
This Thala philosophy of TakeDeep^(TM) is the best thing that has happened to modern cricket. Unnecessary nail-biting finishes are the best.,7
8 runs to defend in the last over and DC are bottling it up!,3
OMG Delhi are really taking it deep,3
DC proving that they are still DD at heart,4
"iyer, shaw and pant are the future of indian cricket they say",2
Lol pant is shit and people want him in T20 team on huge Aussie grounds.,0
Pant looks more of a ghaseeta than Tiwari .. Does it have to do with having child bearing hips?,-1
This is the ultimate test for RCB fans,0
Koach you still have a chance at redemption boy,1
Super over incoming?????,-1
Pant is woefully short of confidence. Can't middle any ball at all.,3
Fucking finally a boundary. When was the last time I saw one of those?,1
"Pant dicking, hipping, punching the ball. Anything but middling it.",1
This is getting too tight now. Stressed AF,2
i think dc have done us the best favor as a thanks for including so many of their players in our national team.,4
Hope KKR get through. MI vs KKR will be a great final.,2
[deleted],7
"Okay, try to win now.",7
Chokers together strong,9
FFS Chahal,4
Loool siraj you idiot,4
Stoinis ain't no tuk tuk er.,9
STOINCOIN ©,8
Why was Chahal of all people stationed there ffs,12
Someone give Punter some Gum. He’s going to chew them nails off,4
Should've been caught.,12
rcb and dc before this match : chokers together strong,16
"After all the crazy stuff in the past 2 weeks, we're back to what was obvious: mi,dc,rcb,kkr/srh.",12
Phew man oh man,5
Stoinis is so fucking strong ✔️,8
Bruh,6
Chahal's genes letting us down,26
CHAHAL NO,6
Thank god,4
Chahal bruh,7
"To those guys calling it a snoozefest, we know our teams very well. Believe in us and you shall be rewarded",5
Wtf is Chahal doing at the Boundary,16
"When Rahane and Dhawan were ""stroking it so beautifully""",2
Koach rehearsing the speech.,8
"Okay, Harsha. Can't make grey hair observations when you yourself have only rediscovered head hair recently.",1
STOINIS YOU PIECE OF ART YOU,7
Chahal bruh,3
How will this team handle any kind of pressure in the playoffs? Iyer can’t move under pressure.,6
Why would you have chahal on the boundary? Brain ded,10
Got excited and created a post ! Thankfully mods have taken it down ! Anyway can we say it now? Ee Sala...,4
Yeah put the shortest mother fucker ever on the boundary line. Useless captain.,21
Ek number ka chutiya fielder ko uss poition pe lagaya hai.,4
DC should loose now for unnecessary singles. Go RCB crush them,0
"Scenes if MI rest boult, bumrah, Sky, H pandaya and de kock.",16
vertically challenged,13
fuck off chahal tried his best in this game,3
Lol Kohli at least look at chahals height before screaming,5
And that might be game.,1
If dc choke ponting will resign from this team,1
Is Koach allergic to Morris?,7
Chahal wouldn't have caught it in his dream,2
Maybe DC figures if they win against MI it's better to face RCB again than KKR(cumming/lockiefergie/varun who's been in form.) So they didn't get aggresive.,2
"If he was right at the very edge, that could have been catchable.",4
Coming man chahal is short its hard,11
RCB - We never go out of style,6
Kohli staring at the wrong person... he should be looking in the mirror,22
"Good on Danny for telling Kohli to cool it.

Should've cracked a Coolie joke while I was at it.",1
This game is to show who chokes most.,2
Who put him on the boundary,5
Who the f kept Chahal at the boundary lol,7
Vertically challenged wtf lee,8
fuck man,2
Koach can do all the angry poses he wants you are the one who put him there you genius.,8
Stokes/Pooran/Pollard would've caught that.,3
Should Stoinis have come ahead Iyer?,6
Why would you have Chahal at deep midwick 😂,5
Only Koach can place Chahal at the boundary.,3
"""Look at the look on the _*FAICE*_ of Virat Kohli""",5
Downvoter doesn't talk to anyone in life... stalks his ex silently on instagram and comes here to release his frustration...,9
Who tf are they getting mad at,3
That wasn’t right from KOACH to shout at my boi chahal.,6
"Why would kohli have chahal at boundary , this is average captaincy",8
Oh kohli,2
Put them fake expressions in you ass koach,8
WTF... Please run a ball. Fuck these high risk shots,1
DAMNN 10.3K comments,11
"So after a two week long drama, RCB and DC, despite losing 4 games in a row each, have managed to qualify (DC second RCB third/fourth). A bit anticlimactic ngl",12
"KKR can't get through now if SRH wins, can they?",5
These don't look like MI-beating teams to me,9
Oh yeah wide.,2
SRK going to Ambani house for tomorrow's team selection request,6
Good night bois,3
Stop fucking bowling wides,3
Mi going to 4 nil dc this season,6
Lmao koach is embarassing to watch sometimes,7
Kohli angry that Chahal is not taller,20
Vertically challenged^TM,6
"Dany Morison: ""Chahal, you gotta take these!""

Chahal who gets out of the way of the ball when thrown from long on: -\_\_\_\_\_-",6
Siraj ffs 😭😭😭😭,2
Stoned-nis BC gaanja maar ke aaya hai.,2
Both teams have lost all momentum built up over the course of the tournament. Wouldn't be surprised if SRH/KKR with Russell win two on the trot and make the final,1
Shreyas: Yuzi Bhai leaked a six for us,3
How can Kohli look at Chahal like that,13
Well come to think of it Siraj at the death isn't exactly gravy.,3
they took their time but finally RCB plays like RCB.,11
Why is Chahal even kept on the boundary line ? He is so tiny,15
Kohli to chahal: why u short? BC,14
Why would you put your shortest fielder on the rope lol,11
"why is kohli angry, that was a very difficult catch. not everyone can catch like pollard.",16
"Why even keep chahal at the boundaries, he's a shit fielder anyway.",5
"Koach: MC BC

Siraj: Lemme bowl a wide lmao.",4
My stream is behind but I swear Pant has one brain cell which bounces around his head like a screensaver,6
scenes if mumbai drops Jasprit tomorrow,6
Why are RR players still topping these dumb lists! STOP reminding me of that team! I’m trying to move on!,7
So delhi get two shots at the finals . Guess it is fair they have been the second consistent team at least in the earlier parts .,9
Koach you bitch,2
Damn danny chill,3
Chahal is so shit fielder he should be to ashamed call himself an india regular edit::: he's generally very shit not about this catch but still he's shit fielder.,-11
Siraj is determined to make DC win in this over.,2
Ok now RCB bottled this ngl,2
"if Siraj bowl back to back no ball and it goes for sixes, RCb disqualify",6
"Delhi 2nd. RCB 3rd/4th.

So predictable.",3
Koach no way yuzi going to take that . Why the fuck is he in the boundaries,8
Siraj repaying DC for the qualification,5
Zampa will be sab for RCB or happy for stoinis?,6
Siraj intent on finishing it this over,3
Siraj as death bowler is so consistent never disappoints,10
Siraj again reminding Koach that he's a bad idea at the death.,11
"Chahal was never catching that.

No Outrage needed.",22
Koach getting mad at Chahal for dropping that one whilst he dropped two sitters of KL against Punjab..,13
Knowing DC they probably would've choked had Stoinis been caught there.,7
Downvoter is a CSK/RR fan...,2
Kohli acting like his vertically challenged ass would have caught it,13
Delhi trying their best not to play mi,9
We could have guaranteed the 2nd position given DC's recent string of losses but we decided to fuck up at the same time as DC in the last few games.,3
"Dhoni: Intimidates umpires to give decisions in his favour🤝  
Kohli: Intimidates Iyer, Rahane, Pant of their places in the Indian team and gets the job done. Kings of mental gymnastics",15
Koach getting mad at a 1.68m fielder who he himself placed on the boundary.,55
Keep your shortest fielder right at the boundary line. Then get mad at him for not being able to fly and take a catch. Damn Kohli is stupid af,64
"Kkr fans don’t lose hope yet, y’all can still hope for a MI win tomorrow",6
QUALIFIED.QUALIFIED,2
Headband on a pacer is a hallmark of lordship,7
"If there is a stat for most wides down the leg side, Siraj and Umesh probably top that",8
"WE CAN STILL BOTTLE THIS, JUST WIN IT NOW",3
"*Chahal drops the catch

Commentators: He went as high as nature allows him to.",61
Morris injured?,3
dont be a kunt kohli,5
It was a easy catch ffs.,-2
"What a shitty over lmao, huge anticlimax",3
"Can't really blame him, I doubt he'd be there if Morris was in the game",3
Yessss RCB qualified,9
"Neither of Shaw, Iyer or Pant has been convincing at all in a pressure match today.",14
"Siraj: *Bowls two wides and a 6 hittable ball*

Koach: *Screams at the short player on boundary who couldn't take a high catch that went above him*.",47
Irrelevant: do you think lara will be a good ipl coach?,5
"Pant hit the glory shot

Edit: THANK YOU",4
Stoinis great player,4
How many teams have won the cup after being placed in 3 and 4. After the play off system was established.,5
Macha we qualified no?,9
"In all the drama that happened in this week, I'm only feeling sad for KXIP.",10
"So in the battle of chokers, DC choked less and won?",6
">We were 5 inches short.

- Kohli",11
Why can't they just try and bowl Yorkers? That shit works,2
Dube wouldve caught that,2
Time to activate agent Pandey tomorrow.,8
"But point is, DC and RCB, both teams can be considered to have qualified ?",4
some wanker is downvoting the comments against kohli,8
Cue: Pant getting out to an ugly hoick,7
Good of lord siraj to gift dc the 2nd spot for having them qualify.,10
Pant is so out of touch,11
Thought Pant got hit wicket,3
Playing 3 spinners saved RCB.,3
E saala cup SRH naamde.,2
Pant has kinda forgotten how to bat,7
"Why is De Villiers keeping when we have Philippe in the team? O.o

We need De Villiers at the boundary line!!",7
Hope SRH pulls through because if top 4 consist of MI bunnies like  RCB DC AND KKR...the most exciting season would have such a flop send...fodder for MI nothing else,7
If only pant had half the confidence of Pandya.,2
Tikta kaha hai,1
Pant's ass to the rescue lmao,2
kohli put chahal at boundary  and then shouting and squealing,3
Perks of thickness,2
We still gotta wait till tomorrow's match results. So frustrating.,6
"Do you guys think if RCB were renamed to RBC, the fortunes might change",3
"MoM - Nortje for me. Bounces back, takes key wickets.",8
Pant audition for new ad,2
"you can dread it, run from it but the legendary 
*RCB choke* still gets to you.",1
"Looking at all these stupidity, one thing is certain.
MI is invisible. If CSK/KXIP/RR had won 1 more match, they wud have been a competition to MI.

MI is lifting it's 5th trophy ...  IPL is going monopoly now.",-2
cbw. chuttad before wicket.,5
DC winning because of Stoinis here,2
"MI X1 tomorrow 

Lynn

Anmolpreet 

Rutherford 

Anukul Roy 

Prince Balwant Rai

 Aditya tare (wk) 

Digvijay Deshmukh

Moshin Khan

Dhawal Kulkarni

Jayant Yadav

Mitchell mclenghan",11
"Seeing both this teams shitting, It will be MIvSRH/KKR in finals.",5
Pant's batting is just horrible to look at rn,5
RCB has qualified for the first time since 2016,6
Kohli during press conference : it ain’t much but it’s honest work,8
"Who r rcbians rooting for tomorrow

Kkr with 1 win streak or Srh with 3 wins streak",6
Pant - Ass before wicket.,8
"Kohli makesAB do most of the batting, the keeping, and pseudo captaincy",6
Pant pls start running for fitness purposes,4
Chahal was on boundary? That there is a bone headed move.,3
Lmfao Pant,1
GG finally won a fucking match.,5
Congrats bois weve both made it,11
"Pant damaged his own ass 😂🤣

Literally!!!",11
That ass rub from Pant has convinced me to cheer for DC,11
Kohli wants his fielders to have the power to grow their height if there is a high catch to be taken.,9
Siraj wants to win in this over but pant is refusing,3
G FUCKING G BHENCHOD,1
pant can't hit a ball straight,4
chahal ko superman samjh rha hain ye. He is the reason they even have a chance of qualifying this year.,8
Game over,3
DC win.,1
"Pant's fat body saved him there, else the ball would have been on the stumps.",14
You guys fat shaming Pant here but his body fat  prevented him from getting bowled there,14
Thala pant,4
Lol,1
Pant finishes it off in style,1
"those ugly heaves from Rishab,",2
Playoffs are going to be boring.,2
Lara spitting facts.,3
Back to back playoffs. Good improvement.. Just need to play better to be a threatening team,6
There it is.,2
"Congratulations DC. Delhi deserved it, Shreyas didn’t",13
Wow pant this belly stopped the inside edge from wickets,6
Cruyff moment. DC and RCB need to hold hands rn,5
Ok one more Rcb match to stress on,9
"""Atleast this is going to the last over""

Lord Siraj: Hold my mascara",12
MI vs DC at Dubai where they have lost only 1 game. Interesting match,6
Bowl siraj 19th over and have chahal on the boundary line. Koach masterstroke,19
I'm over it man. Kohli shows intent after match is lost and people lap up to it. Batting sucks donkey's balls.,19
Okay but why was Chahal at the boundary,13
"Will take that, phew fucking phew. GG RCB see you in                     Qualifier 2",21
Thank you DC 😊,9
Good Game DC.,4
Roar Macha!,1
DC slumping their way into 2nd position,4
Precisely why Siraj should not be playing t20s.,7
The worst 2nd Team in IPL ever I guess (?),7
"DC will get two chances to fuck up now, congrats",8
Lmao did pant just spank AB,3
"As soon as the 17.3 over was done, RCB and DC both quality dropped drastically. Bowling wides, batsmen can't hit the ball anymore.",17
RCB going out in character if not in style.,6
I love how everyone is just happy they qualified,12
Congrats RCB for qualifying after losing 4 matches in a row,14
Lord siraj giveth and giveth some more.,8
"So RCB v DC, RCB is the most meme team.",5
Only way pant can score runs these days.,10
Rcbs batting needs serious work. The last few games were easy wins if we had 15-20 runs more.,9
This playoff qualification feels pointless in our current form.. don't see us winning 3 back to back games,29
Back to back 4 loses and RCB qualifies for playoffs.,9
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",16
Pray for SRH my bois,7
"As an MI fan very happy with this, DC don't scare me while one can never write off abd special especially vs MI.",8
First time seeing both teams so happy after the game.,8
"DC vs MI in Qualifier1.

RCB vs KKR in Eliminator (unless SRH wins).",14
"Wow, imagine losing both games against this shit DC side..",0
I dont think rcb want to face us in the eliminator.,11
DC is actually sad that they have to face MI now lol,5
"Ugly hoick.  
Inside edge.  
Outside edge.  

Typical Pant innings.  

Anyways, congratulations to DC!",10
"That smile after losing, consequences..you gonna face consequences for that koach",5
Siraj: *Fine I'll do it myself*,8
I would just like to thank my DC mates here.,14
Lord Siraj comes and wins you matches in matter of an over.,3
"Gotta say 3rd place has to be an annoying place to end. Not top 2, and not the glory/momentum of barely squeaking in",5
Imo both of these doesn't deserve it,4
dc gg to get trashed by mi in this form,11
This is the first time that RCB has qualified for playoffs since the Koachstorm season in 2016,10
[deleted],11
Moeen Ali bless my eyes next game,13
Prithvi looking a whole lot like Avatar The Last Airbender,10
RCB should still be in the running with DC's RR yes?,0
Pant finally finishes it off for DC.,5
Thank god MI looks good for their 5th title don't look like anyone of this team's going to challenge them,10
Rahane played his role to perfection!,8
Consecutive 4 loses in later half still qualified who could have done that other than DC & RCB,13
[deleted],16
So it's KKR vs SRH tomorrow boys.,9
MI is gonna chew these teams alive in the playoffs. Only real threat is SRH.,23
[redacted],3
HOW THE HECK HAS RCB PULLED OFF TO MAKE IT TO THE PLAYOFFS LOSING 4 GAMES IN A ROW,16
Two meme teams in the qualifiers. If only KXIP also were in too :(,10
Whats the nrr of rcb now ??,1
Damn fuck this beta mentality of totally taking it cautious. Yeah Delhi just needed a win but wtf was that from 13th over till 18th.,11
Somewhere someguy who has just started following cricket would be wondering how is Rishabh Pant a professional cricketer.,3
"Kohli, you owe us one now. Remember to make it easy for us in playoffs",9
Let’s gooo,-1
Fuck I lost 30 coins on this shit performance.,4
A sigh of relief.,5
So both DC and RCB confirm in right?,7
Very happy for Rahane,9
"well played, jinks!",4
Seeing everyone react to Chahal’s in such a negative way is very displeasing.,9
[removed],1
GG DC,-1
Dc tried to be kxip with a thrilling finish alias kxip remains unmatched this season.. the only team that kept giving thrillers one after the other,3
We live to die another day.,9
"Bittersweet moment for Kohli. Still smiling after losing, knowing he probably has one or two more games to play.",10
"Yayay! But damn our batting sucks.
Just hoping somehow some magic happens and we win against MI.",3
Kohli very happy fist bumping Iyer,2
"MI vs DC.

I'll take it.",8
Kohli masterstroke giving Washington Sundar the 17th over. Imagine Siraj in the 17th over...,9
"""Who won?""

_Yes_",6
Prithvi Shaw looks like a sub-ordinate of Dhawan's drug cartel in that hairdo,11
So both qualified? Chitting,7
"Although RCB has qualified, I really don't wish to see a Smiling Kohli. 


For fuck's sake. Being a fan! I'm only relieved right now. Not even happy!",13
"KKR boys, excited for tomorrow?",3
This is rcb's 6th playoff appearance in 13 editions.,13
"Kohli before match: we only look for wins..

Kohli expression after loss: I'm still happyy....",12
So it was RR yesterday who finally confirmed RCB today.... what an IPL we're having...,3
Srh fans are waay to arrogant for an average team,-4
Thank you delhi boys. Although one delhi boy was disappointing.*looks at vk*,13
Can't believe the most competitive season of IPL is with such shitty teams.,7
"Just like last year, KKR is Schrödinger's KKR.",9
"Boys we did it !
Thanks DC very cool",8
Good to see Pant practicing some sledging in this match before the Australia test series,10
Man I want SRH to win Tomo just so we can knock out them Eliminator. I know we can't win the cup with this team.,4
Amazing tournament,2
First time seeing Koach so happy even after losing the game.,4
"Thank you DC! Beat MI in the next match please. Win the cup this time, RCB doesn't have the team to win. And I badly want either DC or RCB to win",19
I’ve never still been happy after a RCB loss,9
Looks like neither wanted to play MI in the qualifier.,10
Given RCB's current form doesn't seem like they will win the next match:(,9
So good to see a happy Ponting,10
I really want KKR to sneak in playoffs and smack everyone asses to win the IPL,2
Well all these dramatic combinations and instead of scrappy close matches we've got wet farts throughout this final leg.,7
"Kohli right now : Oh no

Anyway",18
[deleted],8
Again the strongest line up for Delhi has Stoinis as opener whenever they are convinced that Shaw is useless.,6
Has moen Ali been in good form to get a place in the playing11??,6
The only match where the winning and the losing team both are happy,8
RCB FANS!!!! PUT ON PARTY HATS!!! WE ARE INTO THE PLAYOFFS,8
Why call Mumbai Indians “Mumbai” and DC “Capitals”?,3
Now we can literally crush them lol,6
"Inb4 ""we were 15-20 runs short""",4
RCB's losing streak continues,9
"ABD to Kohli: doesn't matter, we got there...",5
From next match DDP should just get quick runs in power play like he's doing now and just go for after boundaries instead of building innings with very bad strike rate.,7
If SRH lose tomorrow bottom 4 all end up with 12 points. Crazy competitive IPL,7
dAddy stoinis,8
"Being an MI fan, I am happy to know that we'll be facing THIS DC side in QF1. DC looked scary in the beginning of the tournament but they are playing so bad right now. Iyer, Pant, Shaw look like they forgot how to bat.",34
LET'S GO SRH KKR BORING TEAM LESSS GOOOO,5
"SRH is the team I wouldn't wanna face. They have match winners with the bat, match winners with the ball. They are organized and they have a game plan. 

RCB KKR DC have no fucking idea what they're doing rn. 

Also, Warner and Rashid. Enough said.",18
[removed],9
I'm disappointed that only one out of KKR and SRH can qualify now. These two teams would've done much better than DC and RCB. They're no competition for MI.,10
Would have been interesting if Morris wasn't injured.,7
To think that DC were looking to get dropped from the top 4 a few days ago.,2
"first half we played beautifully, second half not so much. If we can match that first half energy against Mumbai, it should be competitive.  Hopefully I get to see this team 3 more times. Been a fun squad.",3
"DC fans: *Lagaan meme - hum jeet gaye*

RCB fans: *Lagaan meme - hum jeet gaye*",9
Do we want Morgan Russell or Saha Warner,8
[deleted],22
Eagerly waiting to listen to Kohli in the post match presentation.,3
From now nothing matters . Just need to win 2 or 3 games and you are the winner,6
I’m already depressed about tomorrow’s match. Ugh,4
Lol always articulate Virat. Harsha stop kissing ass,4
Delhi's wooden spoons are special because they have it twice when there were more than 8 teams,13
I feel delhi and Rcb have not seen the last of each other this season.,12
Pant looked atrocious during his short stay at the crease,10
Kohli happiest I've ever seen after a loss.... was too conservative today...,24
Iyer and Koach confirmed bros,11
"DC  with their asses in hand, ready to hand it over to MI",17
"kinda happy rcb made it, they're a much weaker team than both KKR and SRH",12
"Koach. : “We were 15 runs short but Totally had faith in my boys Iyer, Dhawan and Jinx to play for their spots in the national team.”",15
Okay so today is the toss excuse from Koach.,8
"Chance of two wickets, one gone because the shortest guy in the ipl at the boundary and another because the second shortest guy is too fat",12
RCB 20 runs short of no 2 finish lmao,11
They did take the game away from us!,10
So weird that RCB gets hate for qualifying with 4 loses. That just means they did well early on.,26
"Nobody:

KKR Fans: Ab so jate hai, kal MI ko support karne aa jayenge",11
Siraj : You guys need 15 off 2 overs. Wait and watch.,16
RCB not having that MOMENTUM^TM before the playoffs,15
It's a win win because the fans of both teams are happy and that's how it should be.,9
waiting for my man with the probability charts for the last game,12
Thankfully we don't have to listen to Iyer throwing his player under the bus tonight,12
"For most part, things stayed up to the script today. SRH -> please please win tomorrow. I am afraid of teams like KKR who sneak in at the last min, they will end up winning. They r like '92 pakistan team atm.",7
Rcb fans why y’all happy? You guys now have 4 consecutive losses and have to win 3 games on the trot to win the title,17
I've always acted soo oblivious to the skore ad in front of my dad that today is literally the very first time I've seen the full ad. And I know I'm not the only one. lol,1

RCB 15-20 runs short of qualifier 1,8
SRH wins tomorrow and RCB will start having 2016 flashbacks.,14

"Koach gonna breakup with KL

Iyer is his new best friend",21
looks like the scripts going Mumbai's way now.,5
We were about 2 feet short - Koach,31
"Kohli was angry on Chahal for dropping catch, bruh...you are like 16 years late, at 14 he might had chance to grow taller, but dude was a chess player...",39
why was kohli so quiet today on field lol,6
"LOL, no ""pluses"" from today. He was completely at a loss for words there.",18
Congrats to dc and rcb,19
RCB will prepare for Sandeep Sharma in the eliminator and someone will come out of syllabus.,8
"Another match where we won despite Iyer incompetence as both captain and batsman.

Why give Sams the 18th over?

Why suck all the momentum out of the innings while batting?

Dude does not have a positive bone in his body or some shit. Team ended top 2 despite his incompetence as captain all tournament.",11
"Rahane got that default sad face, so good to see him happy",23
"You don't have two chances at final.

Mumbai and delhi have that.",10

Wow. The only reason Pant is still getting games after this disaster of a seasion is the extremely thin bench for DC. My God. What happened to the guy from last season?,4
"Damn, RCB did enough to not fall below KKR",11

Some of the captains find it really hard to assess their own mistakes.",14

Iyer: Udana leaked runs

Koach: Main Delhi se hu BC, team nahi!",18
We were a captain short - *Koach in some parallel universe*,28
Let this be a lesson to everyone out there..... Delhi don’t lose 5 in a row.,11
"Frankly,I don't see RCB winning 3 out of 3.Would love to be proved wrong,but with the kind of cricket RCB has been playing looks almost impossible",19
"Why is everyone shitting on DC to face MI 

Either you qualify 2,3,4 or in this case 5 you're going to have to face MI 

Need to qualify play MI 

Need to go to finals play MI 

Great you reached finals now play MI",10
"Scraping through on NRR, fourth loss in a row

RCB should be the name of a thriller movie,8
Koach has Lord Tewatia to thank. Saved his ass,12
How good is Shreyas as a captain !,-5
WTF? Kohli was absolutely clueless in that match conference. I think IPL itself is a meme at RCB. The players appear to be happy to just show up for the game.,21
this is going to be the most disappointing  playoffs ever. Zero competition now.,9
"I know its not happening, but its time for Delhi to rethink their captain. Rahane or Askwin should take over for next season, Iyer has made some really horrid calls.",7
All these swearings and probabilities and in the end MI takes the cup as usual :|,26
So which team is RCB facing in the semis?,6
[deleted],10
Rahane and Dhawan need to play their natural sweeping game after reaching to their half centuries - no more cutesy shit in the playoffs,5
Mixed feelings but happy with the result. Happy with the position as well.,12
[deleted],24
DC and RCB both have relief that they didn't get knocked out.,9
Who's gonna tell him they ain't getting 2 chances to go to the final ?,5
"FYI kkr fan's, MI will keep their team mostly same tomorrow they want to win as Robin Singh said, we might just see one or two new guys so chill.",9
"Going to be a challenge for us, playing Mumbai twice in our next 3 matches.",17
"From here, RCB can play anywhere between  1 or 2 or 3 matches.",9
"As someone who supports both dc and mi, I kinda don’t want the final to be between them :(",4
"Before: Getting pissed at RCB's bowlers for not being able to defend scores after batting first

Now: Getting pissed at RCB's batsmen for not being able to score above 150 after batting first",26
Imagine losing 4 in a row still ending up being no 2,30
RR wooden spooner on Fair play table as well.,1
So udana out and moeen in will be the most balanced side for rcb if saini is fit,7
Hope MI plays with their C team against us,5
"MI will beat DC.

RCB will best whoever.

DC beat RCB by 6 wickets that sound like this was some big one side match,12

"The last time RCB qualified for the playoffs:

&#x200B;

\- MS Dhoni was still the Indian limited-overs skipper

\- MI had won only two IPL trophies

\- Ashwin-Jadeja were first choice spinners in every format

RCB please strengthen your middle order .Include Parthiv Patel or Finch if possible.,4

So who do we have a better chance against? Kkr or srh?,8

Padikkal is exactly the kind of batsman that is useless in T20s. A 40 ball 50 is just helping the other team.,22

"Other captains - Lets not do something out of the box & lets just stick to our strengths.


Koach - Lets do something extraordinary and push De Villiers to no. 6, not let washi bowl often in the PP and replace the bowler if he bowls a good over.",27
"Hey you won! Iyer: Guess we did, yeah.",25
"""Through the 11th over, the 17.3 mark was informed by the management.""

Karnataka lad Shreyas Gopal ensuring qualification for RCB with his 23*(23),40
"Yeah we have the worst middle order and death bowling but still I want to see ABD and Kohli lift the cup. ABD needs at least one trophy like this in his career, he is too good a player to not have any championships in his resume.",48
"Template to score against Mumbai:

Divide game into first 15 overs and last 5 overs:

——

# First 15 overs

 - Play out Boult 2 overs. Aim to get 6-10 runs but no wickets. Smash if he bowls more. 

 - Play out Bumrah 2 overs. Aim to get 6-10 runs but no wickets. 

 - Krunal/Pollard: must go for 50 runs in 4 overs even if you lose 2-3 wickets.

 - Pattison/NCN/Chahar: 8 runs an over. Maybe lose one wicket.

If you have done this right, you are at 130 after 15 overs with 4 down.

—-

# Last 5 overs

- Smash 10 an over irrespective of who bowls.

You have 180 which should be enough batting wise. The most important aspect of this is to play out Boult opening spell which really hurts them a lot.",5
Am I the only one confused as to how Iyer has 421 runs??,26
"Where my ""Tu jaanta hai mera baap kon hai"" bois at? Let's party 🎉🍾",14
RCB is the only team after playing 14 games still can't figure out a 11 for the next match,55
"Every time we've made the play-offs, we've been killed off pretty quick, expect no different this time

Happy with the miraculous 2nd place though.",24
"Now that RCB is in Eliminator they have to beat KKR/SRH in Eliminator, MI/DC in Qualifier 2, and DC/MI in Final..
God knows how they will do it",25
Why the fuck is a dude who looks absolutely clueless in interviews our captain lol.,7
Here is the thing.in eliminators there will be added pressure for sure.So batting first may not be a bad idea after all. Just look at how rr crumbled yesterday .And RCB have only vk and abd.,7
Kohli ponting fight? What happened,21
"RCB needs someone who can bash spin in middle overs. DDP plays at 90 SR against them, Kohli either dots or nudges for singles, ABD is completely handicapped when the ball moves away from him. If they continue this way, even with a good PP of 50 runs, they will still end up scoring just 100 runs by 14th over mark. This puts too much pressure on ABD to score loads at the death.

If KKR makes it to eliminator, Kuldeep should play even if it's for just 1 match. His leg spin is far more valuable against RCB than Mavi/Nagarkoti. SRH anyway has the king himself if they make it.",40
you lose your last 4 but have to win the next three,25
"Formula for calculating ""Runs Short"" for Captains after losing match after batting first:

X: Number of runs

Y: Number of balls remaining

X = 6Y + K

Where K is the extra runs constant

K = 6 

K = 12 (For RCB)",5
RCB qualifying is always good news for DC. Probably the only team that we can beat still. Lol. Hopefully we beat MI somehow and RCB qualify for the final.,14
You know Ponting is a champion captain when he captains a team as a coach.,34
"Iyer went from future Indian captain to a joke in the span of a few games. As someone said before, the r in r/cricket stands for reactionary.",47
"To those who think blaming Iyer is wrong because Ponting makes the call anyway, that makes him even more spineless and shame worthy for me.",14
"Is it really impossible that Kohli or Shreyas texted the other guy and made a pact to take it deep ? I'm not salty, just want to know if that is totally impossible.",21
Mumbai has always won the tournament when they were top 2 after the introduction of play-offs,30
"**What RCB used to be:**

Gayle, KL, Kohli, Watson, ABD, Agarwal, De Kock,  Stoinis, Starc, Southee, Steyn, Yuzi, Moeen

**But thanks to Koach, its just pure shit, until Koach remains as ""Koach"" this team cannot win title.**",-25
RCB and DC to share the trophy if they make it to the finals. Thanks to DC for not being salty and benefiting both teams today.,24
These Delhi fuckers finally ensured i don’t watch another game till the playoffs with one game left. I was expecting that a week back. What a piss ass bottling team!!,13
