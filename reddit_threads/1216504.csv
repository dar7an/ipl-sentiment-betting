It's just so hard to drop players like maxi. You'd always think what if this is his day. Cz on his day he'll win match singlehandely. But it doesn't come often though,3
KXIP won the toss and decided to lose,5

Hotstar you ignorant fucks. Fix your stream ffs,5
Bruh fk yea my comment just got posted on espn haha,10
"I think it‚Äôs rather better to bowl first considering how good Mumbai‚Äôs death batting is, they just scored like 90 something runs in the last five overs in the last game while chasing . Moreover, Punjab‚Äôs death bowling is not the best either.",9
One of the software engineers at hotstar screwed up,3
Why did KXIP drop M. Ashwin? I think he was doing pretty good.,3

I don't mind chasing against MI. I am convinced we won't be able to defend 250 against Mumbai. Fucking Pollard always turns up against us,40
Wtf happening with Hotstar?,10
I hope Saluteman does well. Always great to see Cottrel perform,3
KXIP cant take the risk of letting MI chase. These bastards can chase,6

hotstar sucks ass usual,2
"I'm not having any problem with Hotstar on my phone, others could try that for the time being",2
QDK or just DK?,3
he played all around it,1
Wow Hotstar fucked up the game during prime time and on a long weekend.,13
I think they should let lynn play next game,3
Lynn should replace De Kock now. He's out of form. Plus we have Kishan now who can keep.,6

Go on twitch if you're not getting hotstar,0
"If I had a dollar for every time De Kock got out bowled like that, I would have like a dozen dollars. That ain't much, but it is disappointing how a player of his caliber hasn't adressed such obvious weakness. Starc got him out like 4 times in last series the same way",2
wtf is going on with hotstar,5
"Everyone, go & leave a 1 star review of Hotstar on app store.    /s",4

"Just for the absolute fuck of it I want someone to break the Altroz, so that the commentators feel extra guilty when they call it the safest car on the Indian market",43
Dunno how many centuries n runs bave covid ruined the form he is in since last year,-2
Hitman probably had some extra vada pavs today,3
Even Twitter isn‚Äôt working to complain about Hotstar,7
"Mumbai Indians should be renamed Thiccboi XI. Tiwary, Pollard and Brohit - all thiccbois but can still smash you around the park.",5
Is it me or are we seeing hardly any bowled this time? Most of them are catches or lbws?,5

Oh close one,2
Impostor is the Umpire huh?,3

It was a SHIT decision,4
Gote muh mein counter : 1,5
"If there is this much on offer for the pacers, can't wait to see what el Boulto, Pattinson and Bumrah are gonna do here",1
Not a great decision from the Ump though,5
GOOOOOONE!!!,2
Teams that don't open with a spinner against MI deserve to lose. It's kind of a no-brainer against them.,1
"Rubbish umpiring, it was clearly going down leg. He gave it out just cos of the appeal pressure.",3
IPL and bad umpiring. The love story continues,11
"It's an even year..
That's what I remind myself after every wicket",4
Imo reviewing umpire's decisions is against the spirit of the game,33
Paid Hotstar 400 bucks to watch IPL because I missed Tewatia's innings. Now Hotstar having errors. FML.,40
Bruh what a throw,2
Fuck off! That's drifting down leg.,1
Shami's murderous expressions convinced the umpire there,3
Anyone wanna play among us while watching the match?,6
I think one thing we all can agree on is kxip fielding has improved leaps and bounds this year because of Johnty Rhoades,5
Lmao great communication with the run there,2
It just occurred to me that I've never seen Rohit play an on drive. But then not too many players play that anyway.,2
"When will MI bring in Lynn for QDK? He's been struggling in all the matches and lynn is one of the best t20 batsmen around. QDK may be a great ODI player, but he's not that good in t20's (even though he played well last year)",0
You think IPL is a big league where lot of money is spent and they hire these village umpires.,5
SKY is vulnerable to Sheldon,2
"Imagine someone is caught having sex on the ipl fan wall, epic shit right there",13
Anyone facing issues with Hotstar?,6
Is it time to replace QDK with Lynn? They have kishan as a keeping option,4

Every ball he bowled was an out swinger but QDK would‚Äôve never expected the wicket ball to swing out?,2
"One more bad inning by Kock, expect Lynntopher Chris opening .",2
Exquisite shot,2

De Kock sitting there like my mom after my board exams...,6
Hotstar started working for me now,8
"De Kock opens up too early. Once you do that, you can only play the line - so can't accommodate for swing. It's the opposite of Smith, who starts opened up and is side on when the ball is delivered.",3
Is the second boundary a replay or what!,7
I really want to see Surya get back in form to see his cover drives and inside out shots,9
Why is QDk out of form? He's such an exciting batsman to watch.,2

Anyone know the name of the last song btw?,1
Fuck it. I quit. Meet you guys for the kxip innings. Screw you Star with your Disney bucks.,3
QDK looks like a pothead tbh. Is it legal in SA?,-1
Lol the crowd noise is still hella delayed,1

I have picked SKY in my Fantasy team continuously for all the matches despite failures. Hope he repays my faith today.,4

Nohit line crossed. Good luck Punjab,9
How miserable must be one's life? Just imaginw coming to a cricket thread everyday and downvoting everything lmao get laid you pussy,2
I swear if that would have been a run out most MI fans would have lost it.,3
"This is unrelated to the game, but all you folks who use Hotstar, please ensure that you integrate OTP verification and/or change your password.

Funny enough, I didn't know my account was being used my someone else until some random fuck emailed me saying ""Bro send OTP"" (the audacity, lol) after I integrated OTP verification. Even after I integrated OTP Verification, I got a ton of OTP requests from idiots trying in to log in from around the country so yesterday, I deleted my account and created a new one.

another runout is inevitable,2
"Ishaan is trying to hit it too hard, needs to reign it in a bit",5
Kishan struggling a lot.,5
"Classic yes yes yes.

No.",4
130 projected score. lols.,6
Kishan needs to chill. I feel like he's about to play a stupid shot.,4
Ishan looking fidgety. Not looking great for us.,3
Brohit needs to unleash.,2
Bishnoi getting Kishan next over.,2
I don't think Punjab will bat first again (if they win toss) this IPL after the record chase by RR,8
I cannot understand the rationale behind bowling Shami now,3
Big over,2
What happened to Sehwag? Why does he look like a drug addict?,2
Come on rohit running a double won't kill you,2
Im gonna upvote everything just to fuck with this piece of shit downvoter loser virgin ass,4
Bishnoi was India's best bowler at the recent U19 World Cup right?,5
Thanks for shaking your ass Bangar. I'm entertained,7
Sanjay Bangar was hired via MNREGA,30
When will viru stop appearing in these cringy ads? It's embarrassing to watch,3
Mumbai Mumbai shut the fuck up,3
Sarfaraz has become a dynamic fielder. Farcry from the version we saw last season and before.,3

Looks like Pollard and Hardik will have a lot to do at the death.,3
Fuck Start hitting we have a alot of batting to come,4
"For a team owned by the richest man in India, why do you need so many sponsors on your jersey?",4
I think we will get around 150 today. If MI get Rahul or Mayank early it will be interesting.,3
You lose the toss you win,6
Shit kisan please not make us dislike you :(,3
Shami looks like the guy that stands in the corner and watches while the other Mafia henchmen torture you.,9

Lisa Sthalekar legit not making any sense,0
Bishnoi has immense potential. Hopefully he is managed and coached well in both the national and domestic setups.,2
Is the crowd noise played in the stadium as well or is it played only for broadcast ? asking for a friend,2
Ishan Kishan seemed like a bit of a cunt in that MI Netflix documentary,2
I think Kishan would have come one down in the Super over in the last match if he had a few balls left to face! But there was only one ball and he would've been on the non strikers end to sneak a bye and fresh legs would've been the best choice! Or I could be wrong and the Super over batsmen is decided before the first ball!,2
It's like I see dhoni in every other ad,3
Rohit has played spin well today. But the spin he has faced isn't from bowlers with experience so I won't be surprised when Rashid gets him in the next game.,7
Kishan is just a six away from turning it around.,3
How big are the boundaries here? 80+ meters?,4
Why is everyone trying to emulate LORD Tewatia???,5
To the serial downvoter: fuck you. After the match I'll write a bot to upvote all the comments if possible.,24
I watched ODI world cup final 2019 High as fuck the greatest day of my life,7
"Every time Shami gets hit for a boundary, his harline recedes 1mm",4
Even with so many issues hotstar is clocking 4.1 million viewers. Wtf,4
Is hotstar back again?,1
I hope Kishan doesn't do a Tewatia here,2
Who in the fuck is downvoting me?,-1
Kishan looking impatient,4
"Its nice that MI is paying homage to CSK, but we usually do this in the 2nd innings",19
These stupid ass Dream11 ads are getting annoying now,7

"Kishan 14(21)

Tewatia 2.0 on",18

Kishan is just getting set,2

Fielding has been brilliant today.,1
"Oh fuck fuck fuck I resumed Hotstar and Sanjay Bangar is on air. Please, Hotstar, I prefer your 1001 error message over this.",6
"LOL! Did Rahul just say ""Make him run"" to Gowtham in Kannada about Rohit!?

edit: I definitely heard ""Oodsu avange"".",51
Direct throw he was gone,1
A direct hit would be the only way to get that run out,2
what in the actual fuck is going onnnn,2
Kishan just changed his bat. Now watch him hit a six,7
Ishaan playing like Ishaan awasthi,1
"As long as he's keeping up this abysmal-for-T20 strike rate, I'm not sure it's even in KXIP's interest to bother getting Kishan out.",4

Just scrape to 170 somehow please,3
"Saved his wicket and did not dive, so a double win for Rohit",4
Hardick Pound Ya,6
With the form KL and Mayank are in we would need atleast 180. Even 160 looks like impossible rn.,4
"Kishan either get out or get going. MI got enough batsmen to last next 10 overs, and those guys can actually hit.",-2
"We talked a lot of shit about Tiwary, but today might be a good indicator of why MI were choosing him over Kishan. Don't get me wrong though Ishan was great in the last game, but he is obviously younger and has been inconsistent till now.",3

And so it begins,2
Tewatia is happening?,5
That went far away,2

Anything over 160 will be a really tough chase.,3
One good thing about umpires in cricket is that they are quite fast when it comes to reviewing plays as compared to basketball or american football refs for example. Perhaps cricket is more objective than those sports though,3

"Hey, just a question regarding KL taking up the wicket keeping duties this season. Given that he‚Äôs captain and that KXIP are already playing a full time keeper in Pooran in their XI, I just imagined it would be easier of Rahul to communicate with his bowlers fielding elsewhere. So, is there a reason he is keeping this season?

I‚Äôve thought about it a bunch the past couple of days and the only reasons I could think of is either 
a) he wants to show the Indian selectors he is a viable option for the white ball keeper‚Äôs spot, or

b) the selectors told him to keep wickets just to see if he could do it adequately

Thoughts",7

Altroz shilling,3
Haha immediately cut to Jonty after the drop,3
Bishnoi dropped a catch in the last game too...,2
Don't show this ffs,-1

You have so many batsmen and Ishan is still trying to avoid the follow on,5

Ian Bishop mentioning such a valid point. IPL has indeed generated employment to so many players who otherwise would have just struggled their entire career to get into their respective national XIs.,11

Good for MI. Now they can get a move on.,3
"**13.1** Gowtham to Ishan Kishan, OUT, Kishan has no choice but to slog-sweep the moment he sees a ball thrown up. However, the length is too full, which doesn't allow him the elevation. And he ends up drilling this straight to deep midwicket **83-3**

Am I hearing ACDC?,3
pathetic innings from kishan. wasted too many balls wildly swinging.,6

"If Bishnoi wants to be successful at the highest level and not just a half a season or one season wonder, he's got to bowl a proper stock legspinner that turns. 

With his action, his bowling arm almost comes over the perpendicular and that's not ideal to bowl a big spinning leggie. Batsmen can line up easily and just play for a straightish fast ball or the wrong 'un",9
Neesham is gonna bowl 2 overs at the death? Idk about that,3
70 in next five overs would be nice,2
100 on 5 overs...,2

Is that the last of Bishnoi we're seeing for a while? Who are the other spin options for Punjab except Ashwin and Bish,1

These two can easily score 80-90 runs in the last 5 overs. Pandya is yet to bat as well.,2

Predictions for runs in the last 5? Imma say 84,3
"Feel bad for Bishnoi, bowled better than his figures suggests. But getting hit like this would only improve his mental toughness, and as a mentor Kumble would certainly be coaching the hell out of him",4

Punjab needed an Indian fast bowler. Shami alone can't do much at the death and Cotrell isn't really a death bowler. They're screwed if they don't fix this even with a solid batting lineup. Bowling neesham at the death is stupid. He's a middle over bowler at best.,2

Neesham ahead of Jordan is a bad selection considering Neesham was gonna bat 7-8 anyway.,13

Imagine if we had Cummins complementing Shami üò≠,6

Bad choice that was by Shami. No short to Polly.,6

Neesh probably feeling better now that shami has been bullied too,6
Inb4 Gowtham gets Softdik and Polly off successive deliveries.,3

What was that ball lmao,5

4 4s off Shami is a steal considering there's 44 runs to be had in 20th over,3

Have they forgotten yorkers exist...,4

Who is on commentary atm?,2
18 off the 18th and 19 off the 19th,2
18 of the 18th over and 19 of the 19th over so 20 of the 20th 186 final total,5
And trolls were abusing my boi Neesh,2
"18 of 18, 19 of 19, 20 of 20?",3
Kumble be like ffs,1
I'd be disappointed if Gowtham goes for less than 3 sixes in the last.,2
This over has to be 30+,2
Shami wtf,1
Damn Shami's going bald,2
Reminder than MI were 90-odd in the 14th over.,5
Spinner to bowl last over üòåüòåüòå,7
I always wonder why a few cricketers like Pollard/Neesham wear a watch during the game.,2

That hang time!,2

All 6 , toe crushing Yorkers at base on stumps ..good luck clearing the ropes straight ...
And the good old cliche ..
You miss i hit.

So simple , so effective.",8

Don't cry Kumble,5
Gowtham to Hardik in the 20th over going exactly how anyone would expect it to go,10
Cannot blame Gowtham here. Please don‚Äôt,11
Sorry to say but Kings can't win IPL with this kinda bowling attack.. too mediocre,5
Really fucking stupid to play only 2 frontline fast bowlers and bowl one of them out before the death.,4
"Did Morrison just say ""chakka""?",7
Our bowling and batting is way too reliant on 1 or 2 respective players,6
that fucking unlucky edge disturbed shamis balance and he was pounded,4
Rohit is eating up Hardik's vada pavs as well.,35
Pandya on form would have absolutely smashed that.,6
3 balls 7 runs. Not bad at all.,9

Rahul staring into the distance.,18
Rahul is a shite captain,12
Runs coming like anything lol.,1

Lol MI dugout is enjoying this so much,7
What was Rahul thinking giving the last over to an off spinner with Pollard and Pandya on strike lol,11
191 Jesus fuck,7
Kohli had a chat with KL this morning. Shit captaincy,11
"People who have been saying Pollard has been shit since 2018 & they‚Äôve never seen him play two good innings in a row, do you guys feel humbled",4
"KXIP : Look at me, I am the RCB now",9
I see KL attended Koach‚Äôs university of captaining,4
This is absolutely fucking worthless death bowling.,2
How hard is it for a slow right arm to bowl a yorker?,3
Feel pity for KL but today he is as much responsible for this as his bowler.,2
Sending a spinner vs these two is like sending a lamb to slaughter.,7
Well this has gone how everyone expected it to.,7
Pollard just swings his bat and boom six,4

Gowtham not your fault,5
25 off the last. I was expecting 30.,3
Yes. 25 runs.,2
That‚Äôs like the most expected over ever!,8
Goddamn baby! Wooow that was intense fun!,1
"Just tuned in, off spinner in last over wtf are you smoking KL?",10
104 runs in the last 6 overs after being 87 in 14. Just lol,24
Neesham still went for more,3
Polly is a beast,4
"Here's an idea for KXIP

Maybe play the guy who plays in T20 leagues around the world as a death bowler",16

anyone surprised? braindead captaincy this,10
"Runs for me, runs for you, runs for everyone

This is what the past 3 overs have looked like.",9
Gamble to play 2 spinners against Pollard backfired big time,7
What the fuck was KL expecting bowling a spinner in the last over,7
This is like Koach level tactics,10
What much do you expect with a spinner bowling the last over?,2
"If u Bowl Neesham and Gowtham at the death, then u deserve to be thrashed to death. Poor Captaincy from KL. Should've trusted his main Pacer Cottrell.",5
THAT MADMAN DID IT,3
hardik demarques has been working out a lot in bed. he looks like a stick,6
Nope. No fault of Gowtham here. He had no business to bowl the last over. Extremely shitty captaincy whole innings by KL. May cost them the match.,4
That last over showed the difference of power between Hardik and Pollard. Such difference.,10
"Kl rahuls mad, another century?",3
Punjab have ran out of bowlers to bowl on the contrary in yesterday's match KKR were overwhelmed with their options in bowling.,1
This makes you appreciate CSK in the first match more for restricting MI at the death.,1
Welp can't really blame Gowtham too much here. Just shit poor captaincy from Rahul!,5
89 runs off the last 5 overs. Fuck,3
104 runs off the last 6 overs ...,6
"25, not bad not great. Was expecting 30",3
We'll have a bowl thanks,3

We should keep this close atleast with all that batting depth,0
please anyone but MI,3
I swear if dhoni was captain spinner as 20th over choice would have worked somehow.,4
104 runs in the last 6 overs.,2
Not even kidding Pollard would have hit six sixes if he had strike from the first ball.,7
"Had it been pollard playing all 6 balls, it would be 6 sixes.",5

KXIP has snatched the ‚ÄúRCB‚Äù title again from Virat‚Äôs team.,4

What book is Virat reading?,4
You can see it on KL's face... I fucked up written all over,4
Kings 25runsinthelastoverbecauseofbadcaptancy punjab,5
Who bowls an off spinner in the death? Especially to big hitters who eat up spin like Hardik and Pollard?,3
KL Rahul looks like a clueless captain.,5
"KL should be kicking himself for this, there is no way MI should have got past 165 here. Bad rotation",7
"89 of the last 5, wow.",2
More runs for Maxy to chase.,2
Well self sabotage looks like that,1
No way they are chasing this. Unless maxi goes berserk,1
For once r/cricket predicted something right,5
MI at one point looked like they wouldn't even reach 140 but now look at them,4
Haha atleast last over hype paid off,2
"This is a harsh lesson for KL in risk management. If your third pacer is Neesham, you simply cannot take the bet on getting a wicket through strike bowlers in the middle overs. Your plan B sucks dick and you're gonna have a bad time.",7
MI again scored 89 off the last 5 overs. They had scored 89 off the last 5 against RCB too.,7
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",30
Has De Kock ever performed in the IPL?,2
holy fuck MI finishers and punjabs death bowling are at extreme ends. this is a run fest,5
"First 15 overs: 102

I'd just gone to feed the cat and MI is suddenly 191?!dear lord. Pollard is playing in god mode.,5
Rahul mismanaged with his bowlers. Not surprised with the scorecard,12

"Should have just thrown Maxwell under the bus. This was inevitable, at least gowtham have come out looking good.",5
"Hardik is a dad now, I really can't believe it...",3
that's a brain-fade as a captain,3
Imagine actually saving an off spinner against Pollard,6
Kxip fans what death bowlers do you have in your squad,4
"Just in case if you're forgetting most of KXIP player's are from RCB.


Hence the last over effect.",7
"It seems like it‚Äôs irrelevant what a team gets in the first  in the first 15 overs, last 5 teams go insane and get 180-210 score.

"Man, I really hope gowtham doesn't get dropped for this after 20-1 in 3 overs",3
These UAE pitches are high scoring,0
From nowhere to 190+,7
KL Rahul is a great batsman but his captaincy is awful.,3
one of the best parts about MI in the last 2 years is the master and apprentice pair of Polly and Hardik. Absolute destruction at it‚Äôs best. Love it.,4
104 runs in the last 6 overs,7
This bowling is so RCB. Why would you try not one but two new bowlers at the death?,3
"RCB : gives 89/1 in the last 5 overs against MI  
KXIP : gives 89/1 in the last 5 overs against MI

RCB = KXIP confirmed",12
Gotta say. That‚Äôs was some real bad captaining. Could‚Äôve bowled maxwell at the middle as well.,2
Incredible hitting. Feels like Pollard would've got 36 off that over if he had all the strike.,7
89 in the last 5 overs. Almost the same as what they did against RCB iirc,3

Feel sorry for Gowtham....poor captaincy by KL!!,6

This was the whole team version of the Tewatia innings,7
"This IPL is a foreshadowing of what's to come in T20... 3 teams this tournaments have scored 90 runs of the last 5 and all teams have obliterated bowlers at the death.

"KXIP: Selects only 3 front line bowlers and bowls one of them out by 13th over and gets cunted all over the park at the death

Also KXIP: *surprise pikachu face*",11
Bowling a spinner to a set Pollard and Hardik in the last over is the peak of stupid decision making. You knew that over was going for 20+ before it started.,5
feel bad looking at KL's face,-1
"For once r/cricket was absolutely bang on about something. Not bowling a spinner to Pollard and Pandya in the last over. Jeez! If r/cricket is giving you better advice, chances are your decisions have been influenced by a certain Viral Kilo School of Shit ass Limited Overs Captaincy!",7
How good has Pollard been for Mumbai all these years. Always there when the team needs him,11
"Even after these many years, KXIP can't come up with a good bowling lineup for an IPL, it's always been shit and it's continuing. 

Having just a good batting order doesn't do shit if bowlers cant defend the runs.",6
Where do you even bowl to Pollard if you are spinner? He can fetch it from anywhere!!,3
this looks like 2 points for MI,1
It's totally on KL if we loose here.,7
Gowtham should feel lucky for not going for 36 runs in last over.,10
What happened to Cottrell in the last game was a freak incident that likely won‚Äôt happen again. Should‚Äôve bowled in the death.,7
Why does everyone hate MI so much?,4
Mumbai got 20 more because of some good batting and calculator error from kl.,1
Rookie move by Rahul and Poor Gowtham,4
I officially hate KL the captain for ruining Neesham's mood!,4
Shami's expression says he wants to throw the purple cap on the floor as soon as he gets it,7
Shami is like fuck you. I don‚Äôt want to talk.,7
"Why some captain still prefers spinners to bowl death overs ?

First Chahal and now Gowtham",2
Shami seems so nervous,4
After what Pollard did to RCB I wouldn't bowl him a spinner,2
This is what csk is trying to do except the fact that  dhoni can't do this.,22
When you know your death bowling is shit why not give Chris jordan a try in place of cottrell. Plus you get an excellent fielder too,5
"Please don't chastise Gowtham and Neesham for this. They are not supposed to bowl their full quotas of overs, let alone bowl at the death. The blame lies on the captaincy and team selection for this.",21
The last four balls messed up Shaminator numbers.,2
"18th over: 18 runs

19th over: 19 runs

"Rohit showed his class and Pollard showed his worth as one of the best T20 players around. Mumbai have a very good total on board, they should win this",5
"Pollard just says ""Fuck it"" against spinners, doesn't he? All those sixes were so clean.",6
Last 6 produced 104 runs,1
KL really loses his trust in the bowlers after literally one bad outing,6
"If Pollard began that over, it woulda been 6 sixes",8
Shami looks dead,4
Kumble be like: Look how they massacred my boy,6
How much more evidence do people need that Bhuvi is a much better limited overs bowler than shami. He can hold his own in the death. Same with Saini. Shami is a great new ball bowler.,1
[I am a bit of a Nostradamus myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j37aib/z/g7aku6h),5
inb4 KL gets out cheaply and w're saving NRR,8
We have to bring in Ishan Porel...,3
Inb4 KXIP shows Chahar and Krunal immense respect in the middle overs and that costs them the game. Spinners are MI‚Äôs weakest link and anything less than 10 RPO against them is curtains for KXIP.,8
This total is way more than what MI would have expected,4

this is one of the worst captaincy decisions. textbook disaster,7
"Looks another bat first win boys, the captains never learn do they?",3
"KXIP never had good bowlers. Their management always try to go for batsmen only. Then they get Pikachu faced, when team could neither defend nor attack with their bowling.",6

"They lost matches due to their paper thin bowling attack, so what does KL & Kumble do, strengthen the batting more and more. Neesham and Gowtham are 5th&6th bowling options at best. Rather than play guys like Sarfraz they should be getting more bowling options. The way Rahul and Mayank pace their innings, with Karun, Maxwell, Pooram, Neesham & Gowtham to follow what is Sarfraz there for. He's a poor fielder too, so brings nothing to the side.",2
KXIP dropped M. Ashwin and picked Gowtham just to get hit by Pollard and Hardick.,3

1 wicket and you'll witness the demolition of Batting order here.,2
"Lmao just checked the scores!
Who the fuck keeps spinner on for last over against fucking Pollard?
Brain-dead captaincy/coaching!",2
Punjab lacks tonkers like Polly and Pandya. They are too heavily dependent on Rahul and Mayank. This today gonna be a test for Punjab and Rahul.,8
Wtf hotstar stopped working...was fine in the first innings.,2
I love neesh but he really shouldn‚Äôt be in this side if he‚Äôs going to be batting at 8,11
Shit prediction - Boult will take out KL either  driving or caught behind,1
Calling it maxi gonna have one good match and kxip gonna win.,4
First 5 overs 60 needed to keep up the momentum,2
Such a great year for Mayank,2
Early swing from boult,2
"Already an uphill task to survive and score off Boult, Bumrah. Good luck!",3
We bat quite deep till 8th. Hopefully sacrificing our bowling depth actually pays off.,4
They already ahead of us we losing it,2
Boulto bowling to KL Raooool at Eden Gardens during twilight with a pink ball will be fuckin dope. Shame though cause it'll be over within 6 balls.,5
Mujeeb takes wickets at power play and even bowls very good at death. I am still surprised how he doesn't find a place in the team,3
Mayank is in such a good form that he might impregnate his gf in the first try. Be careful.,6

"104 in the last 6 overs for Mumbai today apparently

What's the reason we've seen so many big runs in the death overs this year?

Lack of pressure on the batsmen with wickets left? Bowlers under pressure and failing to execute their plans? Ball coming on to the bat better?",2
It would be sad to see Neesham getting dropped for a proper death bowler  in Jordan or they can trust Porel for it bringing him in for Sarfaraz or Gowtham,2
Have a feeling they'll chase it down with ease,1
Who‚Äôs the guy who‚Äôs padded up?,1
Bumrah looked like he was back in the form in the superover of the last match. If he continues like that then it's gonna be hell for Punjab.,3
The fuck is Wasim Jaffer doing in the KXIP dugout?,5
Why is this Sasta Pandya in team again,15
Boult why u bowling short,4
Bad miscalculation by KXIP bowling Gowtham in the last over. This will be some chase if they get there.,5
"Why is boult bowling short. He has an excellent, unplayable inswinging yorker",5
Why bowl short when the ball is swinging. Bowl to your strength boult!,6
"That catch was possible if he had thrown himself, difficult, but possible.",3
Not the first time discount Pandya couldn't even touch a simple catch because he couldn't keep his ass near boundary,8

Why are people thinking that they can't chase this? Did you not see the last two 200+ chases? Sure these guys lack a good middle order but even if one of them survive till the end they will easily chase this. Pandya only smashes the bowlers on a good pitch so they still got this.,6
Wtf is a boundary in the first 3 overs? Never heard of it.,17
Anyone know why Gayle isnt playing? cant find any info on it.,1
Running 2s easily where MI ran 1.,5
Why did mumbai start their innings like it was a cloudy English morning? Unless we somehow get these two out cheaply we're not winning this.,3
Not one good ball bowled so far,-3
"Mayank nailing those inswingers from boult 
Beautiful, really Beautiful!!",6
not great from the opening bowling tbh.,2
Mayank Agarawal's mixture of intent and temperament is such a great mix. Pleasure to watch,8

Better get the runs early when bumrah is not bowling. Rohit will keep his 3 overs for death. If those Yorkers starts to hit then it will be difficult to score anything above 10.,6

Finally we can see neesham batting üëÄ,5

Krunal Pandya looks like the bad guy from a Bollywood B Movie,16
Krunal making up for that good first over,8
"Krunal should try the village action he did in the RCB game, this is very inconsistent",9
Pooran pooran according to malayalam and marathi translations will be 'sweet dough in cunt' ?,6

Pooran just strikes it so well. Great bat speed,3
Till when would KL keep showing restraint? I want him to start hitting after the 10 over mark.,7
Oh what a beauty,3
The fuck was that KL?,7
Loooool,2
Come on KL,1

KL essentially hit that into his stumps. 300 IQ player,16

Another one sided match.,5
Gg people. I‚Äôm happy that we‚Äôve won but sad that the match is pretty much over,10
What is the definition of wide?,0
Yup this is over,7
Might as well as have hit the stumps with your bat???,4
2016 KL was great batter hitting 100 in Florida but it took him 2 more years to get that consistency. Same with his captaincy he's gonna take some time.,6
Fudge :/,-2
Did Malinga retire ?,-5
"Great one guys, see y‚Äôall in the next one üëç",10
Absolutely did not expect KL to lose his wicket like this. I thought he'd take it deep and then tee off but great we hot him. Now everything rests on Maxi or Taxi.,13
daily reminder - fuck CEAT Tyres,2
Didn't think I'd enjoy Pixie picking up a wicket,1
"Hehe, I was gonna sleep early anyways. Haha",7
Seriously fuck start sports and their ads missed the wicket completely.,4

MI have won this.,7

I don't think Mahela's emotions last more than a few seconds on his face!,9
Maxwell and Pooran together this could be a treat or quick wicket lost fast. Nervous as a fan for King XI,6
Sanjay Bangar knows his stuff but struggles to convey it because of his English. But have to give it to him to keep trying and getting his point out.,14
This innings is basically make or break for Maxwell. Hope we see a repeat of 2014,7
Looks like Kumble went from Walter White to Heisenburg,15
Wtf Rahul wasn't even looking at the ball while playing that shot,8
"I feel sorry for Rahul, cought up in the shit show that is KXIP",9

KXIP are the new RCB,7
Oh my god don't show that village side arm ball by K pandya.Thats so so ugly,3
Really hoping my father would offer me a drink after watching the kingfisher ad,4
This is over. KXIP only has 2 batsman that have ability to play the long innings. Others are the 20/8 kind of players,6
"If Maxwell doesnt perform here, time to bring in the big gun Gayle",4
"If maxi doesn't perform today, imo drop him to strengthen death bowling",2
Why is that book Kohli is holding blurred out?,2
"First 3 overs- 33/0

Last 5.1 overs- 27/3",2
Any thoughts on tomorrow's match?,1
One team smashed spinners regardless of the ball and the other's losing wickets to slow straight balls lol,2
if maxwell doesnt perform tonight. kxip will definitely get wooden spoon this year,2
Let‚Äôs see what these two can do,1
If Maxwell pulls this off I'll be damned,0
Could this be the once in a blue moon Maxwell innings? Would take both him and Pooran to pull it off. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any proper batting to follow,0
Karun Nair vs Robin Uthappa who will win?,0
Hello darkness my old friend :(,6
idk man. it can go either ways with maxwell.,3
This one's over folks,0
RCB is in Rahul‚Äôs very nature. This is only happening cause he‚Äôs the captains.,4
Leave maxi alone. Boy just wants to collect his retirement check and go on a temple tour of Tamil Nadu.,24
"Nair came in 2 bat twice in tricky chases, got out within 4 balls both times. I think Kumble is trying to use him as how CSK used Badri. 

But anyway, Maxi, Pooran, Sarfaraz, Neesham, Gowtham and PinchHitterShami^tm. Still more than a chance imo.",6
Now I wanna what's that plan Rohit,3

Did Harsha just call Chahar a young lady? üòÇ,7
Maxi‚Äôs stance limits his ability to play on the off,2
MI team is kinda scary if everyone gets in their form.. they have one of strongest lineup on paper,3
So we have 2 RCBs now?,2
did he just say Young Lady?,3
It would need some extraordinary drama for Mumbai to lose this,1

Pooran is in great touch today.,1
Man I love Pooran. Can't even start comparing him with Hetmeyer.,2
I demand SO,1
MI to lose,0
Maxwell will struggle the entire IPL then score a 50 ball 100 his next international T20,20
BC HOTSTAR,0
Everybody needs calm tf down with those lame ass tewatia jokes.,7
Although I think he's New Zealand's best bowler I  don't think Boult is a great Death bowler! Don't get me wrong he'll do good against some batsmen but not everyone! I think his left angle makes him bowl length sometimes to quality batsmen and they use it to thier advantage! Saw that with Steyn too alot used to try length and beat everyone with pace! So 2 overs of Boult might be a tough ask at the death!,7
"Omg Nair already batted, when was this?",9
Pooran should look to play deep with the odd boundary. Maxwell should start taking chances.,4
Will Maxwell do a tewatia?,3
Come on Maxi,2
"**G Maxwell vs J Bumrah (T20)**

Atleast not an NRR match until now,2
Pooran >>> Maxwell,0
Odds on Punjab winning?,2
You know you are shit when even DC kicks you out,-1
Pattinson and Boult at the end can be targeted. MI need a couple more wickets soon.,3
Only Pooran can do something,3
We still have Neesham lmao,8
So CSK is the only team that plays for NRR and yet they ended up at the bottom of the table.,4

Can't spell Kings XI Punjab without Xi Jinping,12
Wow krunals bowling Yorkers,6
Rohit giving Krunal 4 overs is a good sign for MI,5
this is starting to look easily chase able now.,1

How would Bumrah's figures look if he hadn't bowled so many slower ball bouncers this IPL?,9
Maxwell Dhoni,5

Good guy by all accounts",8

That was a fucking wide. I support Mumbai but cmon,7
Umpire has as fuck,10
Feel Krunal bowls faster than Unadkat,17

Can't spell Kings XI Punjab without spanking,3
I dunno why but I get baby Elon Musk vibes from de Kock.,7
Maxwell taking off his helmet like he's gonna play a big innings,2
Indian umpires lowkey reek,4
Krunal appreciating himself reminds me of sreesanth,9
Scoring only 27 off Krunals 4 overs is criminal,24
Maxwell at times will look as if he's gonna smack every ball out of the ground and then at times looks as if he's gonna get out every ball,4
Krunal ki leni thi yaar fuck!!,1
KXIP is expecting a Tewatiya from Maxwell but they should be prepared for a Saha,6
How long until the 3rd umpire starts deciding wides?,5
Damn Maxwell without helmet makes me want to take him to a log cabin.,5
How is commiting a murder not a bigger crime than match fixing? That's the real question.,4
"Most Important stat:

Maxi at 69 SR.",8
Danny Morrison is Sunny G lite.,1
"When facing the spinner, simply do so wearing a floppy hat to immediately add 10 to your average and 20 to your SR",5

RRR of 12 and they allow Krunal to get a 4 run over......,7
"The umpiring has been shithouse in this match. I understand that the BCCI wants to develop local umpires but considering how big IPL is, surely they've gotta get the best umpires in the business.",3
Maxi trained smarter now playing NRR game,3
Glenn Singh Dhoni,29
"Open stance really doesn't work for Maxi. He takes ages to get his front leg across and he's always unbalanced even when playing the simplest shot. It might work for longhops, but everything works against longhops",6
This is some CSK level chasing bruh,16
Y'all even think about why we only see Swiggy's ads but not Zomato's ads on TV or is it just me?,7
Should the teams start paying maxwell less? There seems to be a negative correlation between Maxwell's salary and his performance in IPL,11
perfect placement pooran,2
Guys Maxi smashed Rashid around with this stance a few weeks ago. It's not the stance,4
Pat looking old,2
Why isn't Hardik bowling?,2
I am 95% sure this gonna have close finish coz umpire made that mistake.,3
Bond is aliveüò≥,3

Punjab don‚Äôt have the killer instinct. No championship pedigree,6
Will there be a mid season transfer this season as well?,1
"Wooooooh, guess that finally seals the game.",3
Massive wicket there,1
Maxwell's inability to score put pressure on Pooran.,6
Time for redditor Neesham to win it for us lmao,9
"its ok, not a bad knock. I still think we have a chance. 

Maxy is responsible for this wicket, hopefully he adopts responsibility of the chase now and go ham.",12
"**13.2** Pattinson to Pooran, OUT, on-pace this time. Seam-up, full, just outside off, and there has been some movement available today if you land it on the seam. This one deviates enough to take the edge. That is a huge wicket **101-4**

N Pooran c &dagger;de Kock b Pattinson 44 (27b 3x4 2x6) SR: 162.96",1
Time for r/cricket boi to redeem himself.,8
Why are they playing KXIP song when they just lost a wicket,9
shit ipl is going back to normal,8
"Everything is Preity Zinta's fault! TING BC!

/s",1
Play for NRR now,1
Neesh to undo the mess he's done with the ball,4
Mumbai seamers with awesome captiancy from Rohit is a treat to watch.,4
they are playing KXIP theme song after they lose a wicket üòÇüòÇüòÇ I doubt KXIP want to celebrate that,8
"Maxi should be used for bowling a couple, he‚Äôs just not doing it with the bat. And we can use a proper all rounder/bowler then",2
Please send in Neesh for my fantasy cricket,9
Pattinson looks a lot like Jeff from Community,5
Mumbai Indians are inevitable.,14
Neesham 50(15),7
NRR match now,5
Pattinson hitting those test lengths,5
Reddit represent,7
An Aussie and a Kiwi batting together. This is why you gotta love IPL,6
Can someone please explain the stamina meter thingy on cricbuzz?,1
idk how angry neesham is rn. might go hell for leather here.,6
Maxi was scoring 91 off 40 for fun in THAT IPL season,15
Lets go out redditor boi is on strikeee,17
"If interview with Bond gets you a wicket, KXIP should start a podcast with Gayle mid match",15
Bruh they can't even hit James Pattinson,8
Time to unleash the quiche.,8
Everyone is stealing RCBs thunder by being meme team this year,13
Give bumrah a over and finish this shit,10
Inb4 Neesham 69(25),12
Can't spell Kings XI Punjab without unking. Easily the worst Kings franchise in IPL,1
 Pooran with more beard => KL Rahul,11
Pooran looks like KL‚Äôs younger brother,6
Do it for us NEESH,3
Boult wastes literally no time between picking up the ball and throwing it,7
i feel like this is maxwell's game,1
"I don't want Punjab to win, but I hope reddit boi scores at least a few tonight. We need representation.",6
"Mandeep for Nair, Mujeeb for Neesham, Porel for Gowtham?

Reduces them to just 6 batting options, but they look far stronger. KXIP desperately missing some all rounders hence Neesham becomes a necessity, and also Gowtham",6
Redditor off the mark,2
"**Bond (while chatting with commentators):** Pooran's strength is the mid-wicket area. We want to keep it wide and as slow as possible!

**Pattinson:** *might as well try that - gets wicket*",31
Now then let‚Äôs see what the Reddit boy has got,9
Biggest draw back for Kings 11 is their owner. She's always their breathing down their necks.,8
My man smacking them,3
Can maxi pull a Tewatia?,5
That sr lol,3
Neesham should login back and do an AMA if he wins it for KXIP,25
Kids will never know this baby face Bond made legends shit their pants,17
It boggles my mind that KXIP might be on 2pts out of 8 after today and I don't remember them being that bad.  They definitely deserve more than that.,8
I'll stop watching if there's no good boundaries in the next 2 overs. Maxwell is pulling a dentury,5
Neesham looks in better touch than Maxi,12
"Sarfaraz Khan will get 20 balls to score 60 runs and when he fails, everyone will blame him for failing.",17
Shane mid-life-crisis Bond,6
Can neesham prove he‚Äôs worth more than an occasional shitpost?,9
Thot that almost hit the stump lol,2
Why are they not playing Biryani boy?,1
Pollard and Hardik's combined 77 off 31 balls won the match,7
Man Rohit is getting chubbier and chubbier day by day. #thickboi,3
Pattinson hitting some right lengths,4
"This KXIP could be world beaters if they had 1 world class Death bowler alongside Shami. Problem is barring Starc there are non great death bowlers left to choose for. Wood, Willey, Woakes, Southee all are good but not quality of Rabada, Archer Or Bumrah? Beauty of IPL auction ‚ù§Ô∏è",4
Big F to those who argued that kings could easily chase this down just because kl and Mayank.,10
NEESHAM I'LL GILD YOU IF YOU WIN THE MATCH FOR KXIP,12
Play Mandeep instead of Maxwell lol,5
So can these two hit 90 of the last 5 lmao,4
We need to bring on chahar next over and bait maxi into throwing his wicket away. He's got no issues with pace and could possibly take this to the wire if he's there till the end,1
Why isn't Punjab playing Gayle?,4
Scenes if Neesham pulls off a Tewatia-like innings.,2
Maxwell has to do a Tewatia after this time out.,3
Fuck this timeout shit fick of ficking bloody ficks,0
"Man, I feel bad on Maxi but I think you play Gayle if he doesn‚Äôt get going. Maybe push Agarwal/Rahul down to 3?",6
Where is David Miller these days ?,2
boult and bumrah have 2 each. chahar and pattinson have 1 each.,3
Csk vs SRH can't be the big one. Come on!,5
What is Zaheer Khan's role in MI? I see Shane Bond too. Kind of confused!,5
Love to see Dhoni win toss and choose to bowl next match,6
87 off 36 seems tough given it's the second innings,7
"Knowing this IPL, they‚Äôre gonna get 80 off the last 30 lol",9
Maxwells poor strike rate put extra pressure on Pooran. Maxwell averages less than 18 with the bat in the ipl since 2013. Tell me he is not overrated,6
"It's called doing a Tewatia for a reason 


Not everyone can pull it off",10
3 great overs for MI back to back. Pushed required run rate up with getting Pooran out.,4
 Being a KXIP supporter is so mentally exhausting mannn,8
"Has Maxwell's stance made him restricted mostly to his leg side for power hitting? I know I'm no expert but it even in the Eng Vs Aus series, nearly all his 6s were hit to his leg side",4
Sunday is an absolute must win for us bro,8
This over will either get 20+ or maxwell will get out,5
"If Gayle is not back next match I,m gonna protest outside Preity Zinta's house",5
"If Pattinson and NCN are fit, there is no way Australia plays Kane Richardson ahead of those two. Basically Starc Hazlewood Cummins and Patto can be that dream quarter across format, supported by Jhye, NCN, Stanlake, Neser, Meredith etc",4
Wonder what must be the light bill of the stadium,2
Maxwell is literally playing test holy duck,5
Who would‚Äôve thought that Boult would be the least economical,3
Only question is how Maxwell would give away his wicket. Orthodox or Unorthodox shot,5
"I just feel sorry for KL, legend is cought in the shakels of KXIP. Should leave the hell hole real fast",2
Maxwell lol,3
Come on maxy üòê,2
Maxwell over doing Dhoni,7
Looks like the NRR game is what we‚Äôre looking for,3
Maxwell can't hit for shit. He's finished lol,2
‚ÄúRrrrohit Shama‚Äù,1
I'm having this mild pressure around my chest area right now.,3
Maxwell averages just 23 in the IPL,3
Rahul Chahar around and over,1
What is this technique from Maxwell bro,2
bruh has maxwell timed a ball this whole IPL...,5
NRR mode : ON,1
Maxwell unable to hit Virgil van Dijk,3
"KXIP just send in Shami for fucks sake, atlest he know how to swing the bat.",4
Absolute state,1
So Punjab really hoping to hit Bumrah and Boult's 4 overs?,3
"Captaincy proving the difference. MI were similar but pillaged in the end due to shit bowlers being forced to bowl 18, 19",4
Maxis out of ideas,5
Dude this shit is boring,5
This should have been punjabs first loss not its third,5
Do it for the Entire R/cricket  fraternity Jimmy Neesh!,5
Guys Maxwell has to drop his skincare routine <3,1
11(17),3
There it is,2
Murali Maxvijay,2
MI have sussed out Maxwell brilliantly the way Krunal and Chahar have bowled at him,0
Which Tatti Version of Maxwell is on display or is it a clone,1
In B4 Watson comes back to form coz SRH,1
"Maxi take a break bro, you sorely need it",6
i dont think leaving boult for later is a good idea given maxwell might still be at the crease.,2
is it gonna be glen tewatia or glen dhoni?,3
Maxi almost fractured de kock's ribs with that reverse sweep.,4
Might have decapitated/circumcised deKock there,6
One of the worst innings of this IPL.,11
"KXIP needs universal boss back, should replace Maxi as he is not performing well",9
almost hit d cock,4
Maxwell sucks in IPL cricket.,5
So sad to see Maxi like this.,5
Maxi has gone to shit as far as batting is concerned,2
Open stance is never going to work against a leggie. Man is just swinging against the spin,5
that was VERY sad to watch,8
Bruh,1
Maxwell's gone,2
Wow Maxwell just looks defeated after last ball,5
Lol Maxi bro,3
"**14.5** Chahar to Maxwell, OUT,  **107-5**

GJ Maxwell c Boult b Chahar 11 (18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 61.11",1
Put him out of his misery,2
Maxwell can't even play in the UAE lol.,9
"Maxwell is bigger scam than Unadkat.

Change my mind.",14
Extremely shitty innings by Maxwell.. couldn't decide what to do. Maybe it's his stance which makes him suspectible to off side hitting..,4
"Maxwell struggling really breaks my heart, what a talent",3
Finally! Now I can unclench my ass,1
I feel so bad for Maxi man. He needs to find form for next year atleast,1
"Except for that one partial season in UAE years ago , has Maxwell done anything useful in IPL ?",0
Damnit Maxwell is really not in form,2
"Tewatia 1

Maxi 0",2
"Drop Maxwell from IPL, he has past his prime.",1
Now watch Maxwell hit a 100 at 200 SR or above in his next international T20,5
"Maxwell could have done a tewatia, only if commentators stop sucking his dick and start criticising him",3
Maxwell really is one of the most overhyped cricketers of all time in IPL,5
Maxwell's stance reminds me of Gambhir changing to a more open stance after talking to Langer - not sure it's working.,3
That innings was painful to watch.,3
Ok we forgive his hair style after this,1
Am I the only one who think maxwell is overrated af?,3
what a bad day to have eyes,2
"Just a reminder, Maxwell didn't hit a single boundary.",2
50(15) by Gowtham incoming guys,6
Maxwell is no Tewatia,2
"QdK has been a huge flop for MI with the bat, why don‚Äôt they give the gloves to Kishan and try a new batting option like Chris Lynn?",1
"*Smithy in Dubai Hotel room* : "" He's still not training smart this maxi is he? Geeezzz""",5
nrr game,0
I feel really sad for Maxi :/,2
Gayle was benched for this. ü§¶,4
Chahar I think bowled on the exact same spot to Maxwell and still Maxwell found it hard to hit him. MI seem to have found his weakness.,0
Enough already. Bring in Universal Boss. Bench Minwell,1
"*JDS Neesham* **4-0-52-0**

Reminder to disown Neesham if he scores anything below 52",2
Did Maxwell just give up?,1
Kya chota Pandya bade Pandya ko gali deta hoga?,-2
Is Maxwell was a West Indian he would‚Äôve been dropped from the ipl 5 years ago. Just look at his horrific numbers. Averages 17 since 2013 in IPL. Meanwhile guys like Evin Lewis and Lendl Simmons who have very good numbers in ipl get dropped,5
Want csk to lose tmrw,4
Ok sarfaraz let's see what you're made of,1
Fuck this shit. Bhenchod. gaand maaro saalo,8
I'm a big fan of Maxwell. So it's bittersweet seeing him struggle so much that innings.,7
Replace Maxwell with Gayle,0
Maxwell stealing a living since those first 5 innings in 2014 IPL.,7
Chahar was toying with Maxwell throughout the entire innings,-1
ALOO,0
Schroedinger's Maxi,2
"Gowtham really fucked us 2 years back, hope he doesn't repeat the same today.",4
Early finish today too. Will go watch a movie instead,1
"Maxi and Finch are pretty disappointing* ipl players 


*fkn shit",2
im not very confident of boult in the death.,2
Can't spell Maxwell without lame,4
I miss Gilly!,6
"Aside, Kiara Advani in that Netflix ad üòç",5
Replace Maxwell with Gayle and push down Mayank to 3. That should strengthen the batting. Also please get rid of Karun Nair. Mandeep or Hooda cannot do any worse. Try them both.,5
Surely Gayle could‚Äôve done better then whatever the fuck that was,3
Mandeep could have atleast played run a ball innings ffs,6
Don't think a team will go back to Maxwell after this IPL... Shame but entirely predictable.,6
"You can't sit out players like Gayle. He might cost you 5-10 extra runs in the field. But Impact players like him can more than make up for that.
It is same with Watson. I don't like him wasting opportunities one after the other but he will give you a couple of match winning knocks in crucial matches in the season.",8
Maxwell in IPL since 2015: 833 runs @ 18.51,7
Do we have any double headers this season? This saturday?,2
All upto the redditor now.,5
Bringing Bumarah for a mortal combat fatality here,7
Well this looks over. Unless tewatia shows up,3
"Glenn Maxwell auction price this year - Rs. 10.75 crore

His batting innings so far:

1

5

13\*

11

KXIP has been robbed.",10
Seems like Maxwell is going to RCB next season,5
What is happening why there is no ads in hotstar,4
Next time someone in the Punjab dugout should tell Maxwell that its an international match. Maybe he will then take it seriously.,3
As an Indian I am glad Maxwell isn't from India,-3
feel for Sarfaraz and Mandeep. Both for KXIP and RCB they almost always get to bat in this exact situation,5
Ohh. Punjab has batting depth,3
Yeah this burger Khan is gonna win it for us,-1
God save the team that has Sarfaraz at no 7,2
Maxi and KL have absolutely fucked this,6
"Time to play for NRR , Punjab .",6
wtf why is the fine leg there???!!!,3
There are still 4 million viewers on hotstar,6
[deleted],-14
"Sarfaraz should channel his inner Chris Gayle and start hitting big ones.

who am i kidding we are fucked",15
this is peak ex rcb 11,8
Now they'll be forced to bring in Gayle and drop Maxi. Mayank bats 3,5
Sarfaraz had come into the Bangalore side with so much hype and promise. He has since fizzled out very quietly. Also doesn't help that he has been moved all over the order in every time and dropped after a couple games,9
Punjab are the saddest team in the IPL. Should have won their first game when they needed 1 run from 3 balls. Should have won against RR but became the biggest successful chase in IPL history. And got crushed today. They have 1 win and 3 losses now. Should have had 3 win and one loss after today‚Äôs game,23
"Tamil commentators talk so much shit lol, knowing the foreigners will never hear about it",3
"This might be only for the older redditors - but I used to cheer for Goran Ivanisevic in the 90s. He would be so good on his day but never showed consistency (he did win one Wimbledon, so it wasn't total hearbreak). Feels similar being a Maxwell fan.",4
Bumrush still has two overs to go out of 5. Difference between an actually good captain and a batsman you call a captain.,6
Even though I‚Äôm enjoying it whats with the ‚Äòcan‚Äôt spell‚Äô jokes about KXIP?,1
What a jump by Mumbai. Straight from 6th to to the top of the table. That‚Äôs why they are the champions of IPL.,5
"Why is Sarfaraz in the team, since he joined the ipl he hasn‚Äôt even hit one decent shot except those scoops he does",6
Is what Swann saying right? How can maxi forget how to hold the bat right??,5
jesus surya,8
Justice for neutral Fans,5
Wtf SKY,5
S C O O P,2
Lol. Sarfaraz has just one shot?,4
Did SKY just give Sarfaraz a flying kiss?,7
I guess thats why the fine leg is there,3
Gayle in for Maxwell next match?,9
Watching KXIP play really puts into perspective just how overblown the claims about us being the worst team this season were.,6
Why are the players sitting on steel chairs?,3
"Why are people talking more about RCB, we are not even playing in this match!",19
When Sarfaraz was a newcomer he used to score  shit ton of runs by playing all those unorthodox shots,8
SKY looks like this popular YouTuber who runs this channel called YouTwoTV,4
Sarfaraz 'reverse sweep' khan,3
That looked fine. Didn't it?,1
> FYI: That was the **first time** Glenn Maxwell scored less than a run a ball in 21 innings in IPL when he faced 15-plus balls,6
Bumrah back to form,4
That‚Äôs a fair delivery - Read this in Dharmasena‚Äôs voice.,9
surely thats a no ball?,-6
KXIP need a complete overhaul in the middle order,3
"KXIP have been messing up their games since match 1 ,no planning or thought in the way they play",6
Twitter: Bumrah wicket farming,5
And now Neesham's gone,3
F for our fallen comrade,5
ffs Neesham why do u have to be so tall,7
"It was going down.

Fair decision.",3
You know a team is good when they have a plan for our number 7 batter.,9
KXIP need 80 off 4 overs lol,4
ROLL BACK ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,2
"Might as well bring in Gayle in place of Maxwell from here on.

Fucking hell, how is this dude still so inconsistent as fuck despite playing international cricket for close to a decade now?",11
I predict a no ball,-1
MI to KXIP - Sorry Babu,4
"Good decision imo, would have hit the stumps.",4
"That's gonzo. Bumrah, Chahar and Krunal bowled well.",5
KKK is only there coz Karnataka quota. There must be someone better than him in the squad,7
"That beautiful NRR of KXIP is going to take a massive hit, isn't it?",7
"Unless Neesham does a Tewatia, that‚Äôs his IPL career done, as short as a tweet, fitting",6
Man fuck this team,7
"Pentagon, hexagon, octagon Neeshamgon",8
I guess Neesham will have to settle for the Titwala Tamatar Tweet of the match award again.,4
Who is behind this mess a not so Good Coach or a Not captain material Captain,2
That's quite a few times this IPL that batsmen have missed out on full tosses at the body. This could actually be a ploy by bowlers now to surprise the batsmen,6
Why was it taken to the third umpire?,3
Lmao was Boult pissed at Neesham there for getting out like that?,9
All of a sudden Mandeep Singh looks like a decent player to pick in this xi just like i predicted before start of the tournament.,2
God KXIP feels more RCB than RCB,5
KXIP has a good team on paper but always losing the plot,3
MI & Rahul Chahar were not even hiding their plan for Maxwell - leggie spinning away pitched outside off. Rohit was literally directing Rahul to bowl as plan which he did with 90% of bowls to him. Still Maxwell fell for it.,4
Punjab is this year‚Äôs rcb,6
"**15.6** Bumrah to Neesham, OUT, full toss, on off, gets big on him, for a catch at point. They will check the height of the full toss, though. Has dipped just enough in the nick of time. So it is a fair delivery, and another wicket goes down **112-6**

JDS Neesham c Yadav b Bumrah 7 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",4
lol neesham is so overrated on this sub,13
Need to bring in Mandeep for sure. Gayle/mujeeb as well,3
Punjab are sad as hell bro fr,4
Punjab need 20 an over,3
feeling a little bad seeing KL's face in the dugout tbh.,4
I think it‚Äôs time for KXIP owners to sell their team to someone else. They are the real panautis,9
"Instead of slotting down Mayank to bring in Gayle, I think Rahul should move down into the middle order. It will lighten the load of keeping as well as allow him to play his shots instead of the anchor thing he's been doing till now.",4
That‚Äôs an outrageous shot,10
Biriyani 360,6
"While Maxwell is getting all the deserved criticism, Jimmy too has been pure shit. Just drop him and he might produce even more gold on twitter",7
Gowtham to repeat 2018 heroics /s,3
Aren't MI meant to be shit in even years ffs,5
Is that you Maxi my boi?,2
Sarfraz Tevatia,6
Time to drop maxi and get Gayle for next match,1
Mr 360,4
Pls lose by 50 runs RCB lite,4
Can Sarfaraz only hit behind?,3
Lmao wtf is that shot,2
Is it Maxwell with Sarfaraz mask?,2
"KXIP is carrying around a lot of dead weight. Nair, Gayle, Maxwell, Sarfaraz.",7
"No need for the toss for tomorrow's match

SRH will bat first having been the first team earlier to actually win the toss and bat and then having won their first game batting first last match

Dhoni will chase no matter what",5
Sarfaraz is like fuck you and your plans.,1
Tf u choose to bowl if you can't chase.,1
Hotstar is tempting me with a world of media I've never known. Anyone have recommendations for a non-desi?,2
Tasty shot there from Sarfaraz there. Delicious batting.,1
Fucking hell 56% of runs behind the wicket for Sarfaraz,5
makes me think sarfaraz score a triple century in ranji with scoops and reverse scoops,4
What a shot yaar can‚Äôt even do anything,1
KXIP made a huge mistake leaving Eng frontline T20 bowler Jordan just cause he traveled in his first match out of quarantine. Same thing happened Cummins but KKR stuck with him. And now you see.,5
2015 is back bois,2
"Remember Gowtham winning RR the match against MI and Sarfaraz can bat. So this IPL, it's not over till it's over.",4
Neesham economy rate was more than twice his run rate while batting,1
"I‚Äôd love to see a Sarfaraz cameo, even if they lose. He‚Äôs a good Indian bat and I‚Äôd want his confidence boosted",5
"Kings11 seem to have got the bat deep theory all wrong, seems like KL and Kumble would now drop Bishnoi and play Deepak Hooda who can bowl and bat.",3
What a fucking shitty team. It started as at least somewhat exciting but now they are just plain utter shit. They shit at death bowling which cost them two matches. Today they even shat at batting. Most of their batsmen are useless and one trick ponies. Not gonna watch them again unless they pull off something exciting ever.,3
I would love KXIP matches next year when umesh bowls for them,2
Good to have Bumrah back in form,3
Wasn't  Mujeeb a star player for KXIP in the last few seasons? Why is he warming the bench so far in this season?,8
What is he diving for? Lol,6
RCB would have been all out by this time. Can't even meme right!,3
Sarfaraz is known for 2 things - these unorthodox ugly scoops and getting dropped by Kohli.,42
"""Right, This is batting too!"" Loved that from Harsha xD",5
Just bowl slow to Sarfaraz he tries to hit behind the stumps too much,5
That shot looked like a glitch from a video game,3
"Sarfaraz is the very definition of one dimensional Batsman. 

One trick pony.",5
"When was last time Kings XI middle order contributed to any wins?
When was last time Karun nair had a decent knock?
When was last time Kings XI had decent death bowling?

If they can fix this, they would be a better balanced side, so far they have always relied on top order winning them matches, middle order is just stealing the paychecks.",4
Poor man's ABD,3
"They should start a meme play award like fair play award every year! 

Atleast RCB has a chance at that.",6
That's it!!! I'm changing my flair to RCB,4
I just dont see the logic in CSK at the top of Fairplay awards every time,10
Sarfaraz‚Äôs a teddy bear.,6
What is fair play award I actually don't know how it's calculated?,7
I would rather watch Maxwell who play only 5 balls than this shit.,1
"Sarfaraz and Kumble both wants to get back at Kohli, only to realize they have become RCB lite",2
Lol sarfraz . It seems he got scared.,2
[deleted],1
Can't spell Chennai Super Kings without cringe. I think I peaked and should stop now,4
Who is anukul Roy on for?,2
Whose the guy who fielded the ball?,1
Sarfaraz playing a Thala,1
"hi, who is this other top knot fielder? ones rahul chahar, whos this one?",1
I support MI and DC. CSK my least liked team. This is like a dream points table,6
Quantum of loss batting coming up,2
Gowtham PTSD,2
How is fair play determined. Dhoni literally appealed an unfair catch,10
He's chubby Harsha you ass üòÇüòÇ,13
El Boulto just trolled the batsmen at both ends.,7
Couple of snooze-fests in a row and now tmw SRH v CSK,0
That dude who just stopped the ball and chahar could get in an ad and save the fair and handsome advertising team the cost of editing,9
Pitching outside leg stump is such a medieval rule,3
Man Mumbai has the most consistent XIs. Every year they got like 7-8 regulars.,13
Remind me again why I support this team,11
Harsha making it sound like Russell and Dhoni are playing together. Tone it down for ffs sake.,5
3 back to back one sided matches in IPL. Need superover tomorrow,6
Yup no chance Punjab is winning this,3
neesham looking suicidal.,4
"Does this ump have eyes

Edit: maybe I dont",6
"KXIP have a nrr of +1.5?

Time to correct it bois",8
Ex - rcbians showing  their heart still belongs to RCB,6
This is just Sad,1
"We obviously see a lot of Indian players who get national reckoning after a couple of good seasons in the IPL. 

Is there any non-indian player who started to feature in their 
national side predominantly after a good IPL season?",8
Kumble with the way that he has handled Kings11 showing that we are better off with Ravi shastri.,9
No Quantum of Defeat ‚Ñ¢ Considered ?Looks like Punjab have accepted their fate,3
"Back to back boring matches, and tomorrow we. Get CSK and SRH... IPL scriptwriters giveth and they also taketh",8
That was plumb,2
"something very off putting about the umpire saying ""rock and roll it""",5
[removed],7
Ultra edge for what wtf???,3
Mumbai seem to be very good at fielding.,2
Rock n roll it baby,7
Ive heard the 3rd umpire today more than any umpire ever,9
Send in Shami you cowards.,2
Why DRS.. It was plumb,5
Why do you want ultra edge for that ffs.,7
"Oh yeah, call SRH the worst team now

SRH's 1st game was close and honestly unfortunate

2nd game our batting shat itself, but the bowling made for a decent chase

3rd game, comprehensive win

They just aren't that bad",8
Just get all out now,3
"These guys actually thought they can hit like Rohit, Hardik and Pollard did in the last 6 overs üòÇüòÇüòÇ",2
no bat involved. how was sarfaraz so confident about this?,4
Well this is just sad and frustrating. The dugout looks so normal like they are watching some kind of movie. At least RCB dugout looked sad when they were losing.,14
"Forward, forward, rock it rock it",2
Man the MI bowlers really can bowl Yorkers at will!,1

"on the money toe crusher, perfection",2
"Only sad thing as MI fan is now again I'll have to see sad Mchlengan liking tweets of fans like "" Why is Mitch Mchlengan not playing"" "" MI is missing Mchlengan"" üòû",19
"Who has the most balanced teams, irrespective of results so far? (For instance, RCB bowled out for 109 that day, but that‚Äôs not reflective of their decent batting) 

Mumbai is an excellent team on paper",5
"S Ravi has been excellent in this IPL. 

Both as an on field as well as 3rd Umpire",9
"**17.1** Pattinson to Khan, OUT, yorker, given lbw, but he reviews it. It seems he might have hit it, but this has swung as it goes past the bat, and hits him on the toe in front of the stumps. Plumb as. Was that reverse? It went really late **121-7**

SN Khan lbw b Pattinson 7 (8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 87.50",2
Rahul is not a captain material period. It shows in the tense situations. Punjab always lose close games.,5
Daylight between bat and ball . le umpire : cAn wE hAve ulTraEdge ?,8
MI winning IPL in odd year too from now on?,1
Punjab always starts strong only to finish poorly,3
"KXIP should go with this top order and drop Maxi:

Gayle, Mayank, Rahul, Pooran",6
"Lol kxip have just one Indian fast bowler Shami and KKR and SRH have Sandeep, Thampi, Kaul, P Krishna warming bench",6
"KXIP has good options warming bench like Arshdeep    Singh, Deepak Hooda who had been performers so why they don't play them?",3
"Mumbai is the only team in the IPL, who have 8+ potential match winners in their playing 11. This team is still finding it's feet this IPL. On form,  they will be a force to reckon with.",19
Tewatia has put punjab in need of therapy.,8
"Kings not only losing the match, but their good NRR also",7
"Do people actually care about how mediocre KXIP are in IPL?

 I see a hell lot of memes on RCB despite being 3 time finalists but look at KXIP. They reached playoffs just twice in 12 years. They dont even have squad consistency, no icon in 12 years and the performance is ...ok but not good enough. For every one good match they have 5 terrible matches.",24
MI is the most balanced team in the league,25
Sky using his flight powers,3
"How dumb people can be. Match after match commentators keep saying win the toss Bat first is the theme to go so far, yet Captain wins the toss and we will bowl first üòÇ",8
Who's it gonna be next?,2
SKY is like superman at point!,3
SKY-DIVING,9
"Only a Flamingo backfoot defence (FBD) by Boult can cheer me up now. 

Will atleast watch a video",6
"KL, Mayank, Pooran, Maxwell, Neesham on paper is a very good batting line up. They need to fix the other spots and figure out what to do with Maxwell",9
HeS nOt A gOdMan HeS A cOnMaN.,9
SKY just looks happy that he managed to stop the ball,6
Why not Cottrell? all west Indians can hit sixes,6
Sarfaraz taking review like WTF.,3
yes Mandy tell em,1
KL Rahul was not amused,1
Early Prediction of KXIP finishing last looking good. Still early days though.,8
"The match feels like gully cric with little boys, allowing them to bat a bit. So sweet of MI",1
Is there a chance for Pattinson to get into the Aus T20 team after a good IPL?,6
Swann needs to be Punjab‚Äôs coach,1
KL Rahul looks like he just found his crush's only fans page!,5
Well at least we can't play with a worse XI next match.,6
KXIP is trash if the top 2 don't set a platform.,5
Fuck it. I'm gonna support the real RCB from next year. Atleast they show better body language.,4
why is pattinson not even in contention for the aussie team?,5
"Kohli: "" Kumble is only good for fighting with me""",3
"Pattinson ends with 4-0-28-2

Never relying on the score card again",1
How did RCB beat MI? And how did KXIP beat RCB?,7
Wasim Jaffer! Now that‚Äôs a name I have not heard in a long time,4
Our next game is in Sharjah...what you guys think of getting Chris Lynn for that game? I know there's no reason to drop QdK so early but what if?,5
"Mandy looking at KXIP now be like "" Bhen de yaaro,hor na lawo mere nu team ch,fatt gayi bund?""",4
The thing that sucks is that this should have been KXIP's first loss had they not bottled their 1st and 3rd game. The win was literally handed to them on a silver platter and they managed to choke,7
Look at the Punjab bench full of disappointment,3
"Beauty on wheels?

Oh Harsha.",3
neesham and gowtham definitely getting dropped.,3
"Welp Karun, Maxy, Sarfaraz, Neesham have to go. They don't contribute shit. Others are one trick pony with no consistency. This team is fucked.",3
Neither of KXIP or CSK will qualify this year.,5
Dhoni has won 22 out of the last 26 tosses in IPL. I pray to God that he loses tomorrow.,9
Is it true that IPL will have 10 teams next year?,4
KXIP should replace Maxi and Sarfaraz for Gayle and Deepak Hooda,3
"Patinson looks spent. Like how old is he? Don't know whether he'll last the entire IPL. I hope he does tho. Such a promising fast bowler he was, career marred by injuries. But i feel like once NCN gets fit, just one bad performance by Patinson and immediately he'll be replaced by him.",5
Man this must be what slow death is like. Look at the KXIP dugout,4
"Wow, KXIP turned out to be more dependent on top 2 than SRH",4
That car looks like a total piece of shit for real. Imagine paying actual money to buy it,5
Kumble has still lot to learn about coaching an IPL team. Poor team selection and overall planning.,6
"I have never watched Danny Morrison play.

But, based on his commentry, he must have been the most non-threatening pace bowler to have ever walked the earth",4
El Boulto is just stat padding now,2
Movable object meets stoppable force tomorrow,9
Punjab is still reeling from the previous defeat.,4
Cottrell would have celebrated with full military honours for this,7
SKY seems to be everywhere on field today,7
"KXIP have to play Gayle next match. Can't expect Mayank & Rahul to do all the batting everytime. Also get Jordan back, Shami needs some support in the bowling department",3
CSK player can kill a guy in the stadium and they will still be topping fair play thingy. Its absurd how they always win.,18
Man why arent u sending in cottrell,5
"Win toss, lose match - again",4
This is how you wrap up KKR take notes y'all,3
Punjab are so crap even Mumbai isn't celebrating,5
Maxwell should be immediately drop without any further irreversible damage to the team.,5
Cheering dj forgot to press the button here but for a 1 they cheer as if there's no tomorrow,3
So KXP is in pole for worst middle order among IPL teams. That's not going help their cause. I think in another week we will know couple of teams who wont make it to playoffs.,4
Scenes if CSK lose tomorrow,1
Compare to other teams Mumbai looks too strong. This is unfair.,7
Shami's in. 6 or miss time,3
"**18.3** Boult to Ravi Bishnoi, OUT, another one bites the dust. Full, straight, Bishnoi makes room, gets a thick outside edge, Yadav takes a simple catch at point **124-8**

Ravi Bishnoi c Yadav b Boult 1 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00",3
"That was the most depressing wicket I‚Äôve ever seen. Not a reaction from the bowler, batsmen, fielder, commentators, nothing.",11
"Game on boys, don't go anywhere. 68 off 9.",7
Ahhh yes block the ball that wouldve been a wide,2
"""Trent boult gets the 'key' wicket"". what??",3
MI NRR gon be the best after this,2
"Fun to be a rr fan. KXIp was just below us and may have overtaken us but they have already fucked up their run rate scene .

Love you TOM CURRAN.",2
"Jeez Boulty, don't get injured please!",1
"Jordan should replace Cottrell, TBH. He can bat a bit too and is usually way more discplined with his line and length.",1
Rohit should bowl the final over.,3
"So far just Rahul, mayank, Nicky P, shami, Bishnoi look undroppable.

Neesh, sarfaraz, Cottrell will likely get chances

Ashwin, Gowtham are switchable

Maxwell, Karun are simply done


Mandeep straight in for Karun, Gayle straight in for Maxwell. That would be much better",11
Chad Shami will hit a six!,1
Damn I suddenly realized Manan Vohra used to play for Punjab. Where is he now I wonder.,6
Even though Pattinson has done a good job we will bring in Coulter Nile when he is back to fitness I guess. He brings us one more option in the death.,2
[deleted],5
Steal a single on a ball that would‚Äôve been a wide anyway lmao,1
Gothaaaaam,2
Damn that KXIP NRR is taking a hit today huh.,3
KXIP are going to lose that sweet NRR earned in RCB match,5
Not being able to change the flair on my reddit app is killing me,6
At the end of IPL who'll have better NRR?,1
"Mujeeb was out of form last year, Kings XI kept playing him, he was in good form coming into this IPL, he keeps sitting on the bench",5
Shami vs bumrah,1
Bowl a fast full Yorker and finish this ffs,1
Skyer!,1
Gowtham's revenge lol,1
I want to see Chris Lynn play,2
"In the last three games, teams that were doing well have lost by a decent margin. DC, RR were unbeaten and KXIP had 1 victory and 2 close matches.",2
"Love that broadcasters stopped fake crowd noise, lmao",16
We need to remember that the last 5 overs were a mess from KXIP absolute garbage death bowling.,11
CSK going to win the league on NRR,3
Now Gowtham has decided to go for the big hits,2
This is gonna boost MI's NRR significantly,8
This is how you play for NRR csk,9
"Maxwell, if he has to play, should come in at 3 AND bowl a couple of overs. There‚Äôs no justification of him coming in at 3 and after the likes of Nair. And not bowling if Gowtham can bowl 4.",9
What the fuck was that animal licking ad,9
RRR only 57 game on!,3
"Rohit Sharma (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, James Pattinson, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah. 

They have atleast 7 Bowlers including Pollard. Can bat till 7 .

I don't think any other team is as strong as Mumbai",18
What happened to Sarfaraz? He was never very athletic but it feels like he has just got more unfit over the last 2-3 years.,7
Last 6 overs Mumbai scored 104,8
Christ how did Boult manage to go for 42 against the quality of batting displayed tonight?,2
"After that Bumrah smashing in 2018 vs RR by Gowtham, a bouncer is coming for sure",7
"If RCB was bowling this over, I'd still be worried",18
"Karthik would have bowled Hardik and Pollard for 19,20.",5
Rr 104,6
Gentle reminder csk defeated this MI,7
Bumrah this IPL has performed in alternate games. So I expect a bust next game,8
This is where Mi is gonna miss Malinga. He's better than Boult at the death.,14
I don't see any future for Punjab in this year IPL as they lack a leader and a coach who is inexperienced to handle an IPL team.,19
Imagine if Mumbai would have been stopped at 160ish. But Punjab death bowling gonna be there always.,12
"While everyone is in 2020, Bumrah is in Tests",18
Jayant Yadav looks like he's in his 40s now,5
Boult has been extremely mediocre..,-12
Kishan won't get a chance for India if Qdk keeps in every match. Switch 'em up.,7
Mumbai's NRR: *stonks*,13
Why is Mitch not playing? Miles better than Pattinson and has been a Mumbai regular for like 4 years now,4
Gowtham looked better than the vast majority of those who batted before him,7
Boys played well.,7
Rahul looks completely lost as captain. I think their think tank have botched this tournament completely.,21
Clinical win. Let's go boys.,6
I'm going to watch only first innings from now on,7
Every KXIP match there's a player in the opposition whose best average/SR/economy is against us. That's how shit we are.,9
"HUM JEET GAYE.jpg
For the OGs here.",6
"Yay hum jeet gaye üëèüëèüëè Winning by 48 runs is big. But still not a complete performance, not by a long shot.",6
Punjab will win on individual performances only. Don't think they will ever work as unit. They all look too random.,25
"And just like that, MI is on top of the table moving up 5 places. 

NRR is crucial and they have huge gap to the second",17
"I missed the first innings, what I did see of this match was absolute garbage",14
MI will go to top of the table thanks to their impressive NRR,11
Punjab always win the first 2-3 matches only to go on a losing streak,16
And last comment. Who the fuck in any sane mind bowls a spinner in last over when Polly and Pandya are set on pitch?? That was completely retarded.,31
"Pretty chill match for a neutral, although I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm still scarred from yesterday",10
"panauti maxwell finds water in desert  
  
  
  
  
  
drowns",25
Great win but feel for KXIP. They are having similar season to our 2018 season.,8
MI have a 2-2 record but their form is scary af.,29
"Apart from KL ,Mayank ,Shami, Pooran and maybe Bishnoi  no one has really contributed in  a match winning manner so far for Punjab.",14
MI doing the odd year MI and even year MI but in a single season.,21
Anyone seen the Dhoni biopic? Worth a watch?,5
"On its day, MI can steamroll any side lol. Most teams have a good batting or good bowling combo. MI have the most OP players in batting, bowling and fielding than any other team out there. I know it is even year but damn they look good on paper.",27
Punjab's NRR went from 1.498 to 0.521,16
We're out of the top 4 now :(,19
Boult still went for 42 in 4 in a match won by 48 runs. Gotta do better Boulto. We know you can.,18
How many Dhoni movies is Hotstar producing?,6
I've already watched Special Ops stop showing it's add to me again and again,5
"rr, kxip, rcb are gonna make up the bottom 3 arent they",0
"**Teams to beat KXIP (Most times)**

KKR - 17

MI - 14*

CSK - 12

RCB - 12

RR - 11

DD/DC - 11

SRH - 10",22
KL Rahul looks depressed asf,12
Man it makes you forget that there was a 32 ball 28 run innings of Ishan Kishan at one time,20
MI looking really scary now. And given CSK condition in recent I think they are gonna clobber everyone.,12
Sad to see KL look crushed.,12
MI might break the odd-even run here especially if Hardik starts bowling.,13
They are showing Sachin's Sharjah innings on Sony Six,12
Why aren't Punjab playing Gayle or Jordan?,5
"Damn, Must be embarrassing - losing by such a huge margin and then having to wear the orange cap which makes you look selfish",11
impressive how kings have such high nrr even after such loss,7
The RCB defeat really woke us up. Now the juggernaut has begun.,10
Mumbai's gonna go through everyone given CSK's form,8
Maxi making a case for his test selection with that innings. Wasting an overseas spot. Get Gayle in for Maxi.,9
"KL's captaincy sucks.

Don't bowl a spinner in final over with Pollard and Pandya on strike.",16
Gayle for Maxwell. At least we'll get to see the universe boss.,20
I have a feeling we can defend the title if we are into the playoffs,18
Is  Mcclenghan not in team or injured?,7
Lmao imagine wearing the orange cap and seeing your team get humiliated,30
"On a serious note, how is CSK on top of Fair Play after Dhoni claiming the most obvious bounced catch?",33
Boyz tomorrow's match gonna be awesome. CSK v SRH. CSK would wanna bounce back and SRH have brought in Kane and may be sorted out their middle order.,13
Mumbai's gonna dominate this IPL,11
"OK chaps... see you for the maximum village game on Sat. RCB and RR, should be a laugh.",8
such cliched stuff from bangar. even the shitposts on this thread are more interesting.,11
"After Saturday's games - 

2 Teams would be on 6 points, 

4 teams would be on 4 points

2 teams would be on 2 points.

Everyone would have played 4 matches by then.

What do you all think of my analysis?!!!",11
When did Mumbai get Coulter-Nile?,7
I really hope MI does an Ironman snap to the even years 'I am inevitable' Thanos routine.,14
Punjab's got all these talented players they just don't know how to use them,5
I think Punjab should switch Maxwell with Gayle,16
i wish i kl hadn't mocked rohit's running. low blow considering they are mates and all.,12
Is Mumbai first place on the points table?,5
Punjab should've batted first,3
what a comeback from cottrell after the tewatia smacking.,6
These award names are stupid asf,8
Love Cottrell's celebration,9
"From 30 to maiden.

Only cotterel has come out of tewatia ptsd.",20
What kind of injury did Malinga suffer?,5
Rohit ‚Äú uhhh ‚Äú Sharma,17
Polly winning MOTM against KX again,22
so well deserved for polly! <3,10
MI players giving out high fives to fist bumps out here lmao,10
I like Maxxi. Ain't gonna criticize him.,17
"Sharjah this Sunday with Rohit, Hardik and Pollard in form ü§§",35
"**KXIP since 2018**

Openers - 2639 Runs , 384 (4s&6s) , SR 149.6 , Ave 47.98 

Nos 3 to 11 - 2504 Runs, 287 (4s&6s) , SR 127.88, Ave 19.41",21
CSK or SRH?,5
"Was really excited about KL leading India soon, but some of his decisions this season costed his team. Not sending Mayank for the super over, being helpless against RR when Cottrell was getting tonked and now bowling spinner in the last over against Pollard and Hardik. lmfao. He's asking for trouble.",25
On paper this KXIP batting looks great with 5 solid batsmen. They need Indian middle-order batsmen who can just pick gaps and play support though.,11
Lose by less if at all you lose and win by a great margin is going to be the mantra for IPL 2020 unless some teams lose steam half way.,16
well that sucked,17
Yes win the toss and choose to lose strikes again!,13
Need to bring Lynn in.,7
Lol! KL Rahul captaincy exposed big time here.,7
Find someone who loves you as much as Swanny loves Altroz.,1
