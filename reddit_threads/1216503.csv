First,12
RR has to olay both jofra and tom Curran. Their indian bowlers are weak. They should go with the MI strategy of playing two overseas bowlers. If not tom then tye or Oshane,4
My end sem exams are finally over. I've finally graduated. The Royals merch is on. The unemployment is here. Lets fucking go boys. Rahul Tewatia century incoming! LETS GOOO,62

Just a friendly reminder that Delhi Capitals could‚Äôve retained Samson in 2018. I think Samson instead of Shaw or Rahane is an upgrade.,6
Ready for DK's 0(2) again,1
Would be a runfest I feel,1
"Tomorrow either of Mumbai or Punjab after playing 4 matches will have  just 1 win 

And the day after tomorrow either of CSK or SRH after playing 4 matches will have  just 1 win

Damn!!",8

Absolutely loving the IPL so far. Top quality in every possible way - and good competitive games too. Let‚Äôs hope it continues.,20
"RR should choose a better middle order, Tewatia cant help them like the last time.

Maybe Smith or Samson can come in at 4 with Buttler opening with Jaiswal/Uthappa",7
"Delhi and pant failed the chasing test.


Will RR and Samson pass the bigger ground test?",7
"Next 3 matches of RR are not in Sharjah, let's see if Samson performs or turns into a Nokia",8
"Last time our teams faced each other here, in UAE(2014), it ended with a Super-over :

[""Both teams score 11 in their¬†super over¬†but¬†Rajasthan Royals¬†win on boundary count!""](https://www.iplt20.com/match/2014/19#:~:text=Both%20teams%20score%2011%20in,Royals%20win%20on%20boundary%20count!&text=0.6%20S%20Narine%20to%20S%20Smith%2C%20two%20runs.&text=0.5%20S%20Narine%20to%20S%20Watson%2C%20one%20run.)

Royals under Watto was a force to recon with.",8
"Can someone post the order of the ground sizes, please?",8
Will be interesting to see how long KKR will be willing to stretch the Narine experiment. Already feels like they've stretched it for too long.,5
Biggest surprise of this IPL is everyone being excited to see RR matches,62
who's gonna be the tewatia today? Hope its tewatia,10
[deleted],6
Once Stokes joins RR i think they‚Äôre good to go for playoffs...Archer Smith Buttler Stokes with Curran as backup is pretty formidable,4
"Tom Curran has an IPL economy rate of 11.88. Almost 2 runs a ball. 

Until Stokes returns, surely RR should replace him with Oshane Thomas or a Indian bowler and play Miller to strengthen their middle order and provide a bit more depth.",3
Unadkat is Morata of cricket,4
"How we doing guys, how we doing. I‚Äôm scared",5
Hoping Tewatia effect isn't a fluke. Performed with the ball in the first match against CSK and with the bat in the second match against KXIP. Hoping for him to perform well again today.,6
"I think Russell is gonna fail this season, hasn't scored much in CPL, KKR's season depends on Morgan and Rana, and on DK too if he comes in lower middle order.",4
> 5 games in Dubai. 5 games won by the team batting first.,8
[deleted],3
"""no changes, same team"" Smudge you must be joking. That was a fluke win",7
RR need yashasvi,3
Playing an extra blower is no good for them,1
Kartik is the weaker link in kkr camp,2
"No yashaswi again? Seriously? That's sad, so many young players are performing and he is warming the bench. He can open with buttler",5
Omg why do we have to play unadkat every game,3
Both teams are plying with 4 batsmen and 7 blowers,6
">  Rajasthan Royals XI: S Smith, J Buttler, S Samson, R Uthappa, R Tewatia, R Parag, T Curran, S Gopal, J Archer, A Rajpoot, J Unadkat",2
"LOL, they have chosen to chase again in this ground ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",4
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjKrTSrUMAAizyg.jpg,1
Smith is dropping jaiswal so that he can open,6
"Is prasidh Krishna injured? 
 
Should have played him in place of either Kuldeep Yadav or nagarkoti/mavi",2
"Should be a good contest. Big ground, bowling heavy sides and big hitting batsmen.",5
">  Kolkata Knight Riders XI: S Gill, S Narine, N Rana, D Karthik, E Morgan, A Russell, P Cummins, S Mavi, K Yadav, K Nagarkoti, V Chakravarthy",1
Every time I see the Kolkata playing 11 and I don‚Äôt see the star next to Morgan my heart breaks,6
"Don't agree with Styris here. No gain in playing a batsman at 7, fares better for KKR to play an extra bowler",3
"Why is riyan parag still in the team we have better Indian batsmen like vohra, jaiswal",2
"All aboard the ‚ÄúSamson for India wicketkeeper‚Äù train, be ready to get derailed.",2
"why you bowling first?  
smudge: **Tewatia**",4
"Parag should have been out, Jaiswal in at 3/4. Tom Curran also, and David Miller at 5.",5
"man, Rana seems like a good boy",1
Inb4 narine's explosive 50,2
"I can understand the frustration over Jaiswal's non-selection but I believe he's a long-term investment and the club will either retain him or use the RTM. He's not played any T20 cricket in his career and they anyway have Smith, Uthappa  etc who bat at the same SR as Jaiswal. 

Buttler has done exceptionally well as an opener for RR and now as Smith seems to have found a new gear in T20s, management might have thought it might be wise to not fix what's not broken. 

More than Jaiswal, I would say they need someone like a Manan Vohra in the XI. Their middle-order is paper-thin and both Uthappa and Parag are not six hitters. They are too reliant on the Top 3 and cameos from the likes of Tewatia, as things stand.",6
"Royals opted to bat second in a big ground against a good bowling attack, hope they are not doing it just because of dew",3
"Rana is really good and isn't appreciated nearly enough. Last game vs SRH, he literally finished the game in the first 5 overs with his quickfire 26. Always plays per the situation. Should definitely get a look-in for India's T20 squad.",5
Russell Arnold's Tamil accent is always delightful,1
I'm just here to see Archer tonk some more sixes,9
Is Varun even shitty than Unadkat ?,1
"I am gonna make a post about why WI players have nothing like superhuman might. It's just dependant on their stance and technique. Players like Gayle, russel, Narine. All of them.",1
Why the fuck are RR chasing here when the pitch is known to slow down?,5
"KKR has the right balance, but except a killer Instinct or a hunger to win.",1
"My thoughts about- Jofra Archer, arguably the best bowling allrounder of IPL. The way he tonks sixes like playing baseball and his sheer pace. What a lethal combo...",7
Corporate boxes are one of the worst parts on modern day sports. Soulless fucks,4
Idk why but narine hitting a few is always a delight to watch,5
"Aussie and English fans must be confused today whom to support:

Pat Cummins               Steve Smith

Morgan                          Buttler+Jofra+Tom",6
[removed],4
"Considering both Tewatia and Parag can chip in with the ball, do RR really need 5 specialist bowlers as well? Jofra is in good batting form, but still RR's tail starts quite early. 

Do they have an Indian allrounder?",2
Looking forward to Sunil Narine shenanigans vs Archer... or vice versa.,6
"If KKR win today, we'll have 4 teams with 2 wins and 1 loss and 4 teams with 1 win and 2 losses. Fuck yeah!",4
"do something ~~special~~, KKR",3
TIL that the only measure of a good pitch is the frequency of sixes.,8
"Apologies if this is a stupid question, but isn't Sunil an Indian name?",17
Uthappa‚Äôs smiling too much I‚Äôm concerned,13
RR and RCB have the best jerseys,16
Archer could bowl so much faster if he bowled in his underpants,22
"Both team has good players like Smithy, archer, butler samson, tewatia, Gill, Russell , Cummins and Rana ... difficult to pick a side today",5
wow uthappa got another match. poor jaiswal.,12
"150.7 kmph. fucking hell Jof he's a kid, go easy",31
Where are my English RR supporters at? Show yourself up.,10
"150 

bowl a bouncer Gill looks iffy against them",5
Narine shaking in his boots thinking of a 150kmph bouncer.,6
Beautiful over.,3
Great first over Jof,3
"After Tewatia's last performance and the article on him called ""Romance of Struggle"", I am seriously considering changing my flair to RR.

This match is going to be interesting.",4
Damn Archer great work,4
"Gill looked decent against 150kph, good signs.",4
Narine wishing they didn't think of him as an all rounder,5
Expect Unadkat to bring Narine back to his Supreme batting form next over,8
This is why you give Archer the new ball.,9
Pretty great over first up,3
Unpopular opinion: Smith should bowl all the 20 overs.,8
I hate Gavaskar with a burning passion.,-6
"Commentators talking about Jabalpur & Mount Abu, nice.",4
[deleted],1
Jofra Archer bowling 150Kmph balls like it is second nature to him. Wow.,8
All it takes is one over from unadkut to undo all the good work that archer did,3
idk what to feel more sad about. sunny bhai saying that 'rhyme' or slats not getting it.,1
RAJCHOOT,-3
Fast Bouncers without room are the way to go for Narine. Sitting duck against short stuff.,5
Jof's over was pure fire,3
That six would have gone out in Sharjah.,2
Why are we even playing this guy?,6
Smith! You Coward. Bowl yourself.,6
commentators having an orgasm over gill. deserved tbh.,1
I keep hearing ‚ÄúKhan Academy Six‚Äù and then I get SAT exam PTSD,6
A proper Test cricket shot played in T20 is like porn for Sunil Gavaskar lmao,9
"5 of the current RR team members have been with KKR in the past, there are no former RR players in KKR line up",4
"Goddamn it Gill is proper cut above all the other young Indian batsmen, Shaw included.",8
Just love me some Gill shots.,4
friendly tip- you can use picture in picture mode in firefox to watch the stream and shitpost here at the same time,4
When are we going to see umpires with funky tattoos,2
"Gill is absolutely class, what‚Äôs his long term route into the India team though? Where would he bat and who is he in direct competition with?",1
ANANTHAPADMANABHAN,3
Can we just end the Narine experiment already??!,8
"Yashasvi, Devdutt, Prithvi are all great talents but boy is Shubhman om another level entirely. Nothing seems to deter him. Playing Archer and Rajpoot like they are bowling easy balls.",4
Fair to say that teams have figured Narine out and its time to demote him back to 8?,4
"Sanju Samson reminds me of Rohit Sharma, hitting more sixes than boundaries! Hope he shines in the International circuit as well!",5
Kkr is gonna hit big today no pressure at all !,2
Has anyone of you watched Archer clean bowled a batsman nd the ball flew for a six? It was insane,3
"Okay, commentators again making fun of Indian names",1
love to see smudge owning the field with some alpha confidence.,2
Bruh what is the point of Narine opening if he just eats up balls then gets out in single digits,7
Narine's batting is a myth.,8
Well time for KKR to end this Narine experiment and get couple of proper batsmen in. Can't be 1 down for nothing every game,5
Archer avoiding bowling bouncers to avoid triggering Smith's PTSD,2
Its RR's turn to lose the match. Come on KKR.,1
I want RR to win just to send a FUCK you to these commentary & pre show panel who every 2 minutes keep saying it's not sharjahan for RR.,6
Is it just me or has the quality of matches improved this season?,1
Finished work and looking forward to watching Tewatia vs KKR match today.,5
Nice save there,1
RR are playing rcb next. Yikes,4
I was very confused with my fantasy players today. Who all are there in your team?,0
Uthappa was always a likeable character in Indian cricket especially during that 2007-08 dream run,1
Naraine is not looking good today,1
They can't end the Narine experiment as they will have to answer to Gambhir on Twitter,5
Jofra was bullying Shubhman in that over. Best of the batsmen would have be struggling there.,3
Narine at opening position is a waste.,3
Unadkat: statpadding time,3
Lol. RCB on the 3rd spot with a NRR of -1.450,3
"ankit rajpoot is so underrated in the ipl imo. bowls near 140, and has a brain while bowling, unlike guys like umesh and siraj",7
nArInE wOnT wAsTe bAlLs,4
I want to see Robin Uthappa in form this season. Dude was a very fine player. Don't know what went wrong!,4
C'mon Sunil stop putting pressure on young Gill,1
RR released Rahane just to end the confusion between him and Unadkat,4

Narine experiment not working,0
Oh Narine! What do you want to do?,1
"Can the commentators shut the fuck up about RR and Sharjah, it's not like the other teams had Different conditions lmao",3
naraine has used up a whole ass over to score his first run. not great.,5
Unadcunt has a decent record lol. Feelsbadman.,1
All I want is a tewatia hat trick and 6 sixes in an over. Is that too much to ask?,6
run machine for kkr cmg in to bowl now,1
"should have given Archer another over

next spell he's going to be bowling in the 130s",2
Narine is Tewatia minus Sharjah and self-belief.,4
"tomorrow MI vs KXIP, any thoughts on what changes for MI and KXIP's bowling...",1
This is why I said drop one bowler and open with Gill and Tripathi. Narine does not look in good nick here.,3
"Gambhir used Narine well, against weaker bowling attacks, you can't play him as an opener in every match",3
"I know he doesn't but Jofra's action creates an illusion that he is chucking

Anyone else feels the same ?",0
How many balls will hou drop man..,4
"Well fuck thanks Uthappa, thanks for that",4
Bc mc bc,5
ROBBIE IS THE IMPOSTOR,9
Tactical drop. 500IQ Uttapam,8
Nice statergy to drop the catch,10
Hahahaha. Narine being Narine.. and Utthapa being Utthapa..,5
"Fuck of Robbie! Seriously. He can't bat, he can't bowl, now he can't field!",3
Is unadkat bowling good ?,1
RR playing 4D chess dropping Narine,5
Stop Narine from opening,5
Wtf Robin. That's as simple as you can get,4
"Uthappa  doing it for us even after going out  , thanks man .",3
IPL and drop catches - name a better love story,7
"If RR lose today, then all 8 teams will have won at least one match and lost at least one, with 3 games played each

Would set up the rest of the tournament quite nicely",4
Robbie thinks he is still playing for KKR.,5
F,2
Hurts to see poor narine struggling so much.,3
Narine opening hasn't worked for KKR since Gambhir left. What an insult to specialist opening batsmen.,6
Agent Uthappa at it again,6
lmao someone called this 10min ago,2
Drop feels forced,3
"I like the Narine tactic if you're using it for specific reasons - targeting a particular bowler, something to do with the conditions or the match situation... But if you're just doing it automatically every game I think it becomes a bit useless if not even a liability.",2
5D chess from Utthappa. Keep Narine going.,3
I love watching dropping catches. I enjoy the fielders embarrassment. I think I'm a monster.,7
"Sees above , no issues with light . Damn",3
"Robin playing his last match, was a nice timer of the ball",2
"Narine is just a one shot batsmen, move to the leg side and try to hoick it without seeing where the ball is...",5
BruhThapa,3
Fucking send him home already! Buddah Uthappa! Bug ass stupid.,1
this is a second drop from uthappa in two games. deserves to be benched for this alone.,4
Tactical drop for sure,8
There‚Äôs no excuse for that.,4
LMAO RR don't want to see the back of Narine,3
What the fuck is with gavaskar and catching with fingers pointing towards sky,2
Gavaskar loves talking about the ways Indians catch,0
"Robbie without gloves is bad.
Better use buttler as outfielder",4
Uthappa is always playing for the opposition.,3
Why is Robin still on this team lol smh,1
4D Chess to keep Narine out there to eat up balls.,2
Hide Uthappa.,1
aur kitni tasalli chahiye. isko nikalo please,3
Really? A 3 run Unadkat over? In the powerplay?,7
Too much water in Utthappa.,3
"Is Narine good enough to play just for his bowling? If not, Banton should get a look in. They have enough bowlers anyway.",4
is RR ready to trade uthapa with csk?,1
KKR at this point are pretty much opening with a walking wicket,2
Narine's novelty factor has worn off like yesterday.,2
"I don't think there is any other society on this planet that has ""educational"" apps sponsoring a sports event. I just want to watch cricket in peace, all this talk about coaching, exams etc brings up few of the most depressing and worst years of my life. I grew up in boarding school since third grade, all the way till 12th. All these ""education"" ads are giving me PTSD. 

(BTW we only had outing day once every two months, it was that kind of boarding school)",5
Uthappa should be benched,0
FFS!!,1
Smith's expression at the dropped catch is a mood,4
Lmao someone here had said he'll contribute with one obligatory drop,4
4D Chess to drop the Narine catch. This is better for RR.,1
"Indians now can't catch

The lockdown has made them Pakistanis",4
why is uthappa even playing?,2
Gavaskar's Indians can't catch with arms pointing upwards is BS.,2
Dinosaur Premier League,0
"Nicholas Pooran last match

Narine this one.

If the trend continues, Uthappa will also drop Andre Russell later in the day",2
"I can never judge how Jofra is as a person. He barely displays any emotions. Just writes random shit on twitter, has an old man run up and fuckin bowls 150 kmph + 

Quite an interesting character.",34
"Properly shit commentary from Sunny tonight... first he thought Gill was an RR player, now apparently Indians can‚Äôt take high catches?",8
C'mon Naraine you know what he's gonna bowl  tonk the f out now,6
What is Sunil Narine role as as opening batsman again?,7
Yes Sunil. Fuck the game I‚Äôm supporting narine with the bat,7
Finallyyyyyy,0
Has anyone of you watched the Archer delivery that clipped the balls and the batsman couldnt stop rolling on the ground? It was crazy.,2
Lmao fielder reached the ball but then realised thaf the fixer had paid him to let it go for 4,5
Lovin the fielding,2
Feels like Ankit Rajput & rest of RR bowlers are bowling on completely different pitches or something,2
"uthappa should be very very disappointed with himself. not cuz he dropped the catch, but he made smudge sad",8
Why did RR buy Uthappa? He was struggling badly last season.,4
How many did Uthappa drop this season?,1
"Could the Narine drop have been intentional to keep him there? If so, is that sort of tactic frowned upon?",3
Sanju that should‚Äôve been stopped lmao,3
Don‚Äôt show the replay I can‚Äôt stand the fucking pain,7
LOL UTHAPHA,3
"Narine's failure is putting pressure on Gill, who is a proper batsman. That's counterproductive.

I hope Shubman doesn't feel that he now has to play rash shots.

Need to re-think the strategy from the next match. The problem is if Narine does not open, KKR has to drop one of the Indian bowlers and bring in a batsman.",7
Sunil Narine is auditioning to be the Murali Vijay of KKR,5
Isn't the dugout stream supposed to be adfree?,4
lol catching is something i really wanna see getting improved this season especially high ones!,1
"Gill is the best young Indian batsman, such class.",2
Shot Gillyyyyy,0
"Rajpoot , Unadkat , Uthappa, who else has played for KKR in this RR side ?",1
ohoooohooo that shot from gill was just class.,2
Uthappa with the tactical drop so that Narine can waste balls.,3
A bit unfair on Jaiswal. Should have got a couple of more matches to prove himself.,2
Maybe that's the break Narine needed.,1
Gillegal shot,2
IPL has given us some great talent. Gill is the next one who will force his way into the Indian team for sure if he keeps batting like this.,2
Why doesn't KKR think about putting Narine as a floater and bring him when spinners are operating,6
Tewatia redemption arc for Narine?,5
It's time for to KKR move on from Narine as a opener,1
maybe Narine is trying to emulate Twetia's last innings,1
"Imagine if you went back to 1970 and showed Geoffrey Boycott footage of Narine opening the batting... Just picture how furious he'd be - ""An ethnic playing my cricket? Outrageous""",6
What's sunny keep going on about Indians not being used to catching with their fingers? Gross generalization or are fielding coaches in Indian grassroots really that bad?,4
"Russ: Let me go up in the order and fuck shit up skip. Please

KKR Management: BC, stand back and stand by",8
They are better off opening with Cummins than Narine,7
gill is playing such a glistering innings damn,1
Sunil Tewatia narine,5
Time to swing it like a madman for Narine,3
They should definitely open with Rahul Tripathi now even if Narine performs well today,2
Even RR doing their best to ensure Narine doesn't get out.,8
"That lame-ass downvoter back again, hope you are not RR fan.",6
Future of Indian cricket right there. Hopefully Gill gets good guidance and opportunities. Love him!,1
Glad Robin dropped sunil,6
The cricket greats ITT knows more about cricket than some junior league nobody like SunnyG,2
"5(11)

Hmmm, when have I seen this before.",7
r/cricket will meme Naraine to Sunil Tewatia.,5
"Maybe this Narine opening thing should end

Teams appear to have figured out how to counter him and he's just wasting balls that actual batsmen could use",1
the tactical drop was inspired,3
Everyone needs Dhawan glasses to counter Dubai's low LED lights.,2
"Narine's constant ""I'm so done with this shit"" expression is mood.",3
"c'mon Narine bro, do a tewatia! for memes sake",2
"Gill's SR this IPL: 105.93 (89 runs in 84 balls)

Edit: of course I know it's a low scoring chase he batted in, this just goes to show how overall stats have a lot of those 140-150 chases where you can fairly score those 70 (60) type innings.",-1
Should the Narine opening experiment end? Would love to see Banton open although not sure how he gets into the team with the 4 overseas limit,5
"naraine and gill are the literal opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of skill, technique and visual appeal wrt cricketing shots.",1
"Lmao what's the bat change for, he's not even hitting them with the bat.",5
Only a few overs before Sunil Tewatia Narain makes /r/cricket eat humble pie.,9
"Narine didn't call for the drinks

is the dressing room telling him to get out",4
"This Narine can't even f-ing run.

Gill is calling for two and it ends up being a one. No quick singles as well.

He was a hand-eye coordination batsman. It seems Narine's reflexes are not working as well. :(",3
"How I think I bat: Shubman Gill

How I actually bat: Sunil Narine",8
Unadkat started Unacademy using his IPL millions.,10
"unless narine does a mini tewatia, kkr would rue this decision",2
"Moral of the story: Doesn't matter if your name is Robin or Rob or Bob or Robbie. If you can't take a catch when you're Robin, you sure as hell can't take one when when you're Robbie. Some skills or lack thereof, transfer despite changes in identity.",3
RR know what's coming if they don't get Narine quickly! It's mishits and dots all now until Archer comes back and he smacks him for 5 sixes in a row!,6
smart of smudge to use up unadkat rn knowing that naraine cant hit ball with bat at all.,0
Meanwhile my boi Gill keeps hitting unfazed.,0
"are people hearing gavaskar commentate Indian catching method for first time?

He did it all every fucking time he commentate.",1
Only redeeming factor for Narine is that he's at least trying to score.,1
Tewatia is happening,4
Tewatia incoming,2
Unadkat on fire,3
Lara's voice is music. How long till they sling that Sanjay guy back in?,1
Bringing back to form,1
MS Narine,0
Slower ball is literally the worst ball to Narine.,1
Talk now bitches!,2
It has began bois,1
Changed my stance .. robbie should have caught it..,2
"I'm not saying it will happen, but we were saying the same about Tewatia guys...",2
Uttappa has saved the team 10 runs already,3
anr rcb fans here rmb the time narine absolutely fked us with the fastest 50 ever?,4
Narine gonna pull a Lord Tewatia,5
"Unadkat helping fellow human being by giving him some delicious pies

Edit - Lol. Khila pila ke maar dala zalim",7
Nothing like facing Unadkat to get back into form,6
"Guys don‚Äôt troll Narine please,, I fear the r/cricket curse",17
Haha it‚Äôs Sunil Szn,1
"I knew if there's one bowler who'd bring back hitting in narine thats unadkat

Edit: definitely jinxed it",5
Siva sounds like he's about to cry every time he speaks,1
Narine's parents should have worn a condom the day Narine started his batting practice.,-5
Season after season I give Unadkat the benefit of doubt but he bowls utter garbage EVERY SINGLE TIME. Honestly beyond belief how he manages to be so dogshit on a consistent basis.,1
Ffs we all know Narine's weakness apart from Unadkat.,6
Unadkat proving a game changer for the opposition as usual,1
Omg I love Narine now,5
Our tewatia,2
Narine channeling his inner Tewatia,2
"Tewatia part 2!!!

We really should stop mocking struggling batsmen",7
"Narine giveth , Narine taketh away",11
"Narine: Struggling.

Unadkat: Hold my Kachori.",16
"Congrats r/cricket, got another guy into form",8
15 of 14 ain't bad I guess,6
Lmao that was fasta pasta,3
Unadkat has entered into Kohli mode.,12
Btfo,1
Why do bowlers go wild after dismissing an out of form Narine?,10
Unadkat acting as if he got the wicket of Kohli lmaoo,10
When Gill is an opener there is no point sending slogger from another end,2
Unadkat calm down mate. That's just Narine,8
Better now than giving Unadkat overs when Russell is around.,6
"**4.5** Unadkat to Narine, OUT,  **36-1**

SP Narine  b Unadkat 15 (14b 2x4 1x6) SR: 107.14",1
Lmao was Unadkat looking at Uthappa while celebrating,11
Is Narine going to do a tewatia ?,2
Night watchman is gone.. geez,6
Getting knocked over by legendary Unadcunt is one of the worst ways to go.,4
"Based on Unadkat's celebration, I thought he got Russell out! üòÆ",11
Lmao Unadkat could be a left arm spinner,4
Aaand he is gone. People have ro realise not everyone can pull off a Tewatia.,9
Celebrating Narine's wicket with such intensity smh,11
good ODI knock this by narine,-2
Commentators Curse.,3
What a rollercoaster the last 3 balls were,5
Unadkat celebrated like he won the World Cup for India in a super over final.,32
unadkat gets the wicket finally. shouldve been over 3 if not for drop-appa.,9
Unadkat reacting like he got David Warner out,34
"Lol, Unadkat doing the full come on making sure he faced Uthappa while doing it. Don't blame him, I'd be pissed too.",13
"Calm down Unadkat, a bowler just smashed you for 10 runs",8
Thank you r/cricket :') This Sub is the real RR fan,4
"Stop yelling Unadcunt, your only wicket of the season is a slogger who puts no price on his wicket, after he hit you for a 6 and a 4.",13
Unadkat average pace is around 120? How is this guy paid so much season after season?,13
Celebration felt like Unadkat took the wicket of Don Bradman.,29
Guess Narine is no Tewatia :(,1
[deleted],-1
Nevertheless a decent start,3
"A handy Narine 15 or a 21yr old with more 50+ T20 scores in a 6th of the amount of innings, who you got?",7
"man, how disappointing Unadkat has been this season!!",2
Ffs spoke too soon!!,2
"KKR has the ugliest jersey, along with DC",-5
"What a nice commentary room with Simon, Mark, Laxman",3
"Wait till unadkat gets an actual batsman out, he'll start jacking off on the pitch yelling YYYYYYEEEEAAAAHH WOOOHOOO",16
Celebration if unadkat gets rusell bowled,5
Tamils are having hard time pronouncing Tewatia in their homes. ü§£ü§£ü§£,7
"Was just going to meme unadkat as a better name for the academy than dinda, and he takes a wicket. 

Can't even shitpost in peace huh",3
Unadkat is the guy who goes on a mile long run after getting the batsman to glove one down the leg side.,7
The fake crowd dj is very quiet today.,6
"Ashish Nehra in the Dugout

There is 1 imposter among us",19
Unadkat just has that permanent underdog look. In an annoying way though.,4
Seeing Nehraji after a long time,2
Nehra in Duggout should be interesting.,6
Lmao people trolling in polls even,5
Nehra ji in the dugout lol what shithousery is this,21
Unadkat stays emotionless throughout the IPL so he could yell and celebrate whenever he gets a wicket. But the poor fucker gets almost no wickets.,13
When will Banton get a chance?,5
"Why is it that whenever you promote a slogger to opening position, they suddenly decide to be proper batsman instead of just slogging away?",15
They had Chris Lynn who was far better than Morgan,-5
good for RR they moved away from blue jersey. I hope either RCP-KXI  and DC-MI also change to different colors.,0
"I remember people praising Rana like hell once, what happened after that",2
Too many dots.,1
KKR please don't open with Narine from the next game. This strategy of playing with only 5 batsmen is going to cost KKR some important games in the future.,4
Unadkat will tear away his jersey like a soccer player if he gets KL Rahul out,8
Nehraji is in Dugout. That's it!! I've seen everything now.,8
"*50% voted Narine*

*Narine was The Imposter*

*0 imposters remain*",12
Did uthappa add spit to the ball couple of overs back when dropped the catch?,1
Will we get to see Russell Muscle today,3
Was there some beef between nithish rana and Gill? I recall reading something a while back...,11
How many catches have been dropped off Unadkat's bowling in IPL?,10
Miss Nehra as RCB bowling coach,7
"Nehara ji in Dugout, fitter than ever.",5
Why dont they try Andrew tye instead of curran?,4
What happened to Tripathi? Played well for Pune and then had a off year and has disappeared since.,6
Lmao did Nehra say Brian Narine?,10
"For youngsters, is it mandatory to have sleeve tattoos to get noticed by ~~Senpai~~ Kohli",74
[deleted],21
I'm convinced that csk will buy Unadkat for 50 lakhs next year and he will proceed to become the purple cap winner,55
Nice feshan rana,6
Can someone from India explain to me about this Josh crap? Is this a big tiktok replacement?,5
Gill seams like a real talent. Glad that his parents didn't wear a condom that day.,-6
St. Narine,6
Narine is a quality bowler but I really want to see Banton especially when these pitches are still fresh,8
That light in the dressing room looks like a halo over Narine's head,6
"S. Narine in: 

2019: 143 (9 inn), Avg 17.87, SR 166.27

2018: 357 (16 inn), Avg 22.31, SR 189.89

In 2018 he made more runs than Uthappa, A. Russell, N. Rana, R. Sharma, and M. Pandey over the season.",6
New drinking game: Take a shot everytime they say music box on wheels,4
Serious question - is the Altroz a popular car?,11
How long do we think until a ball hits one of the cars?,8
Swann gets overly enthusiastic about that car,4
"KKRs batting line-up is all top quality, lesser known indians and pinch hitters from the Caribbean! Morgan seems like a mismatch",6
I thought Mark Nicholas and IPL wont go well but glad he is here,11
I've enjoyed Swann in the Dugout but his love affair with Altroz is cringe worthy,13
"Virgin other teams : Get Narine out with pace

Chad CSK: Get him out with spin",17
"Altoz comes on screen.
Commentators: Greatest car ever made in the history of humanity.",13
"Nehra: ""Rana isn't a big hitter""

He literally has more sixes than fours in his IPL career lol.",19
"Nehraji just called Shreyas Gopal -- ""Suresh"" Gopal. Lol.",34
"Narine & Opening was a fling, that was great at first - but soon it turned into a toxic relationship.",20
Mmmmm juicy,6
What is arnab doing in the stands?,3
only here to watch gill. everything else about this game has been zzzz.,4
LSK jerks off to spin bowling,1
"Fuck Sivaramakrishnan had one good international series, 40 years ago (my first ever watching cricket). Not what I would call an expert at bowling..",-2
Gill you sexy beast,4
Shubnam clean hits gill,6
"Damn that car can play music. Now I must buy it, this innovation is few decades ahead of its time.",17
We want Lord RT,1
Mujeeb at home,3
Rana is the real pinch hitter.,3
The talent Gill has is frightening. He is going to be some player if he continues to play like this.,5
These two are gonna drive the innings from here,3
Riyan,2
Fricken hell Smithy get yourself into the attack. Bowl some of those full tosses.,8
Tye play :(,1
What athletic fielding by Unad !,1
Why are they still playing when the capital has been lost?,1
Parag has a bit of Mujeeb about his run up.,7
God Gill is so good,3
Unadkat diving skills are impeccable.,8
Sad to see Riyan failing. Last season was good for him. Nothing substantial this year,6
"Banton won't play now, The Pitches are suited for him now, Later they'll get slow af",2
This Pan Parag is ruining things,9
If you want spin from both ends then why not Smudge....,9
Budget Mujeeb,4
"What the fuck are all these fantasy eleven apps. Dream 11 was already enough, now it seems like there's a clone for everyone fucking clone",8
"Parag's action is fugly

Looks so awkward",6
Not so sure about the inclusion of NehraJi in the dugout.,10
"What are the chances that Unadkat will be released by RR before next auction? Someone who was was bought at INR 11.5 crores, it hasn't really turned out to be a great return on investment for RR.",9
Bowl tewatia you cowards,24
"They are hoping someone will hit the car, it's free advertising on social media",7
"These two youngstars, Rana and Gill, are the only players I see staying with KKR for the next 7-8 years.",8
"Guys how is select dugout? Thinking of switching from kp,shiva, sunny and other cringe commentators",5
When does Manjot Kalra's suspension for age fraud end?,3
Rana: *Nahi nahi hume kuch nahi chahiye. Hum to bus itna chahte hia ki aap hamara swagat Riyan Parag se kijiye*,8
*everyone‚Äôs favourite strategic timeout*,6
Gill is batting freely when Rana is around. This is why you don't open with Narine and put pressure on Gill.,22
"SUNIL NARINE is costing KKR badly now. Eating so many crucial PP balls, puts pressure on another opener and curtails to get big numbers in powerplay. Just for the sake of 2 boundaries from him in 4 overs, he shouldn't be opened from next match. This ship has already sailed.",12
Gill is milking them. So assured in a T20.,5
"RR: Mum, can we have some Mujeeb?
Mum: We have Mujeeb at home.
Mujeeb at home: Parag",13
Wtf is smith tryna do with riyan parag when they already have 6 bowling options lol,5
"""Everybody's favourite strategic timeout"", appreciate the sarcasm there Mr. Swann.",54
Mark Nicholas is so condescending all the time lol...,4
I can't imagine a better son in law of Sachin than S. Gill . Lad has a bright future .,15
Is there really no one with a RR flair on this sub!,7
Even strategic timeouts are now branded,9
"heres an idea: have one commentator with non-cricket background - preferably with an MBA and let them parrot these in-game advertisements.  Its painful and cringey to hear former cricket greats swoon over cred, unacedemy, altroz and what not.",66
Nitish Raina needs to go big here.,6
lmao robin trying to get tf away from his team with this interview during time out.,10
Gillman looks as un bothered by spinners as girls are to my good looks.,61
I want dreruss to come at 4 now,3
Sunil Narine is useless on Dubai and Abu Dhabi pitches.,2
"All I want is for Marais Erasmus and Kumar Dharmsena to reunite and hear the ""Murray"" calls. 

Is that too much to ask‚ÄΩ",6
Serious question. Was Harsha Bhigle dropped as a kid? How come he is actually good and not ridiculous like most other commentators?,12
"Christ Shubman, that's a man in form to be able to convert that",2
Gill has so much *time* to play his shots. We shall watch his career with great interest.,12
We‚Äôre gonna regret that one,4
Donno abt others Sunil narine shud open against rcb at sharjah,12
"Gill you are not Lord Tewatia , don't do that.",7
Would love to have Harsha join dugout,2
"It's starting to turn. DK should come in next, he's a good player of spin and can attack the spinners.",1
My spirit to watch the IPL has dropped with Delhi losing due to stupid tactics.,3
Gotta say SPD uses spinners as well as any Indian captain would.,2
"Even though I support RR, I would not mind Shubhman to score a hundred today.",3
"Gill and Rahul, the next big opening pair. Good future",2
"wrist spinners are a dream to watch, lovin Gopal vs Gill.",1
"""samson is my main man and shubhman is my second""-- simon doull, a supposedly neutral commentator",4
Is it true that Sachin Tendulkar‚Äôs daughter Sara is dating Shubhman Gill?,5
Gill is skill,1
Smudge is probably scared that Lord Tewatia might end up taking wickets from his bowling as well and they will make Tewatia the captain,8
[deleted],5
Question: Do aussies watching IPL root for RR by default?,3
Time for our hero Tewatia to get some wickets,2
The lord himself,3
"Here comes the lord.

Unzips",6
Clean hitting by Gill,2
Yassss.... Lord Tewatia,2
"First time I‚Äôve got the chance to watch RR, hoping for big Jos innings and some more massive 6‚Äôs from Archer.

Knowing that because I‚Äôm watching Buttler will get about 5 and Archer will be our having a hoik first ball...",1
Lord is here,2
Our lord is here,2
Here comes the chad .,1
Gill and Rana look cool together.,2
Was that a drop?,1
"Royals ""fan"" here who has hardly watched them play. Why does our list seem so mediocre compared to other teams?",2
Please please someone nuke tewatia's over,3
"**Oldest player**

Almost pulled a Warne there,1
Both flop dives by Samson today,-1
Bow down to Lord Tewatia you humans.,3
Samson bro,1
Love watching 2 youngsters having a go,1
I hope that they send in Russell next. He will be hungry for runs and deserves some time in the middle.,2
Lol they just compared him to kallis. I am dead,6
Villian to a Lord.,2
What's the bowling equivalent of what Tewatia did the other day?,5
Lord is here,2
Nitish Rana in T20s >>>>>>>>>>> Shreyas Iyer,3
Samson won't die wondering in the field.,1
Fuck Slater totally lied about what Tewatia said post match....,3
God testing his alter ego through Samsung,4
Shit it's a drop!,3
Robbie still playing for kkr,5
Swann giving a big compliment to Kallis by comparing him to Lord Tewatia,1
KKR looking set for 200 from here,1
"7th bowling option, cool. Next up smudge himself",2
"Oof catch dropped

Oh no the Lord has struck us with his vengeance !,6
You can't dishonor thy Lord,9

Can someone put a leash on Nehraji. His commentary isn't classy at all,3
"**9.6** Tewatia to Rana, OUT, **holes out to long-off!** Another page in the Tewatia story. Goes over the wicket now, fuller and flatter. Rana miscues the attempted loft-drive into the off side. It's off the low part of the bat **82-2**

Swann loving Tewatia as much as he loves Altroz,5
Why does every paanwala in Bangalore looks like tewatia,5
Mark Nicholas is drunk. Called them out for not appealing for a catch that was dropped and called that 6 off the bat when it fell 20 metres short of the boundary. Proper Bill Lawry areas.,2
Is there any way to get this dugout commentary on sky?,6
"Rana is not in the top league just because of this. He plays these wonderful cameos. But, rarely converts it into big ones.

So much ability, hope he learns to be a bit more patient.",5
Tewatia needs to be in the Indian team!,4
Swann orgasming over tewatia> Swann orgasming over Altroz,3
Wow this thread didn't blew up as I expected it would,3
Lmao,2
Russell already?,3
Who the fuck looks to hit a six of lord tewatia... Brain dead batting...,7
"Nehra ji is telling again and again to bring on Archer while learning slowly slowly about the wicket alert.

picking up wickets for fun. #JustTewatiaThings,6

Never should've been 4",3

Archer good,5
DreRuss must be missing the likes of Umesh and Siraj ... Jofra isn't his cup of roid drink.,9
Such a strange bowler to watch is Jofra. He looks unplayable some days and a dibbly dobbler the next. When he finds some consistency he‚Äôll probably become ranked number one at some point. If he doesn‚Äôt find that consistency he‚Äôs in danger of being one of those ‚Äòpotential‚Äô players we always remember twenty years after they retire.,6

Brilliant from Archer. If he gets Russell's wicket now just give him motm.,5

DK to remain as Captain for 10 games over or under,1
I want a team with Archer and Rabada,3
Test match line. Beautiful dismissal. Change the color of the jersey to white and people will think this happened at Lord's.,4
Now I have a debate on my hands. Two Englishmen against each other. Hopefully Morgan gets a quick single then Archer gets four consecutive wickets at the other end.,4
Man I feel that gopal has been really unlucky this ipl. He gets a lot of edges but he's not gotten wickets,6
I don't know when was the last time I saw Karthik leading from the front for his franchise.,4
"can't remember did Warnie down play Archer during the Ashes

is that why Archer brought his A game tonight",1
Captain of KKR doesn't know where to play Dk. His place is changing in every match.,1

Hope they don't pan to SRK every 1.5 minutes for the rest of the game. IPL is better to watch when the cameras are not showing owners and fans constantly.,8
I don't know why Karthik is captain of KKR when you have players like Eoin Morgan in the team,6
SRK the CEO of UAE .,3
Captain Morgan.,2

Bounce him Joff!,3

Don‚Äôt let an Archer masterclass distract you from the idea that Russell should always come out to bat with 8-10 overs left to bat. KKR have finally made the right move today.,3
Would be funny if Archer progressively wore larger and larger gold chains every game to troll the world. Appears in the final looking like Mr T. Just imagine the meme potential.,31
"Average pace 148+

Fuuck!",11
Lovey single to get Morgan back on strike,2

What would you guys reckon of a RR vs Delhi finals?,4
4 for 2 in 3 overs. Damn why did west indies let him go,11

I know he's a brilliant bowler with a lot of skill but something about Jof clocking 150+ elicits primal joy in my monkey brain.,4
Madhuri is thicc.,4
Big over alert from me,2
I wonder why Archer fired up for this game,4
"""Proud of how the english school system has produced such talent"" Swann on Jofra",14
That's not a wide,1
This is the over guys!! Let's see,4
Seems like this is going to be the last IPL for DK.,3
Fickle game is cricket. Four weeks ago I was screaming for Archer to be replaced with Woakes or Curran. Now I think he‚Äôs the best bowler since Waqar Younis. Wonder how I‚Äôll feel next week...,3
Take that you cunts,3
"I thought the whole point of the Parag + Tewatia overs was so they wouldn't have to use Rajpoot again

Wtf Smith",1
RUSSSEEELLL YOUU KINGGH,2
Seems like the optimal time for cummins to come in and hit archer for 4 sixes,2
"Who is better? Archer or Unadkat? Even though Archer isn't a left armer, i think Archer is better. What do you guys say?",5
KKKR's best batsman is yet to come. Pat *the bully* Cummins.,3
Only Archer can control Russell in this bowling attack.,4
Rajput in and they already got the big over alret on,2
Imagine if archer actually had a run up instead of a jog,5
BC this would be explosive.,3
"I hope Morgan cements his place today in the team ,, for next match they should drop Narine and bring in Chris green or Ferguson, so Rana can open the innings and Morgan or Karthik can bat no 3 with Russell at 5.
Everyone gets good amount of time to pace thier innings",4
"He's got 1 from Archer, 2 from Unadkat and 3 from Tom Curran

No need for Rajpoot",1
"If Russell can survive Archer, KKR would still reach 200",2
"If Russ bats till the 20th, RR will need Tewatia to do another Tewatia

Shitty jinx",6
Soon Jofra will be bowling at 200 kmph,6
Buttler should risk his life and say fuckin knobhead to Morgs or Russell. Imagine the consequences,5
How are Windies able to power hit with such ease,7
should have given rajpoot the end with longer legside boundary,3
Shut up you moron that's a blatant wide,6
Holy sh,4
We are fucked,3
Rajpoot is medium pace after facing Archer,2
Oh no Rajput has Russell lol,5
All that time I spend shitting on Rajpoot and he gets Russell out lmao,7
Unadcunt gets it. Dozens of crores well spent.,6
"3 overs 2-4. Jesus, Jofra too good for the IPL",16
Kkr doomed,9
All out below 150 now.,10
Rajpoot? Really Russell? Really?,8
Bowl away from Russell is the trick,3
"[Jof by the end of the season](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AbleCorruptDrongo-size_restricted.gif), if his chain grows with every wicket",1
Yessssssss,2
Great job Rajpoot,3
Like I said in my previous comment . keep the ball away from him !,3
Unadkat to r/cricket: talk na,7
Both Russell and Rajpoot couldn't believe how he's gotten out lmao,8
Okay so our target is 150 now?,4
Ball touched the ground,1
It‚Äôs time for Cummins vs Archer?,9
"Dreruss falling to Ankit Rajpoot, not in my India :'(",2
The ground is big af. F.,1
Unadkat + Rajpoot getting Russell out. What has the world come to !!!!!,6
Rajpoot takes Russell wicket,2
uggh cummins is gonna be so exhausted now when he comes in to bowl,1
"Don't worry guys, 15cr batsman is yet to bat.",5
this wicket deserves that celebration.,3
lol KKR's lineup consists of 10 pinch hitters and Gill.,10
How much was Jofra retained for this season?,1
Archer should be credited with half a wicket for that,6
Lmao Russel is such a bully. Can't play shit against good bowlers but swings at everything from not-so-popular bowlers xD,4
"Pat Cummins only bats well when the bowler he's facing has good figures so that he can ruin them, meaning that he doesn't get jealous",6
And that's the difference a bigger ground does. Mishits won't go for six,0
"**14.2** Rajpoot to Russell, OUT, **taken at deep backward point!** **115-5**

AD Russell c Unadkat b Rajpoot 24 (14b 0x4 3x6) SR: 171.42",2
Make way for da real MVP - Cummo.,2
Archer does all the defensive work so the superior Rajpoot can attack. Clever.,4
Ffs patty get an armguard on next over,1
"On one hand I want KKR to win to keep RR in check. On the other, RR has Jofra and I can't root against him :|",5
Rr has finally got a team as good as the big ones and now there's going to be an idiotic mega auction year. Man Fuck,4
"Was worried after about 8 overs, what a turn around this is shaping up to be",3
And that's why you don't send sloggers up the order,-1
Cummins at 7 is weird to see,2
RR is going to chawe easily. KKR needed Russel to get to a competetive score.,4
Pat cummins at 7 is a thin batting tbh. KKR should do something,5
Seems like SRK left Mumbai to come to UAE at the right time just as his name is about to come up in the Bollywood drug case.,-1
Finally the best batsman of Kkr,1
Salman looks fat in the new ad,4
Archer may have not got Russel but he contained him enough to let Russel take unnecessary risks from other bowlers,5
Russell no drugs :(,5
kkr batting is slim considering they have Narine and Cummins in top 7,11
Dre russ gone,1
Why is kkr playing so bad?,3
Did you know Kolkata used to be the old capital of India but it was transferred to Delhi in anticipation of both teams performance in IPL 2020.,11
"As an Indian, my default is to hate Smith, but he looks wonderful as a captain. Calm and composed",9
why does morgan get hyped as a batsman? i dont get it.,-14
This is what he was trying to ball from last three balls,7
Rajpoot thinks he is still bowling to a right hander,5
Nice header in to the top corner,4
"What a Trainwreck of a batting order this has been , except for Gill and a bit of Russ",9
What sort of batting lineup has Morgan at 6 and Cummins at 7?,32
Cummins in for 33(11),7
Well directed header there from Morgs,4
Watch Pat the bully Cummins score 10 ball 30 now,9
This is like the 100th time Morgan has been hit on the helmet,9
Morgan should start charging down the ball and be more attacking. Finch seemed too be struggling to and finally seemed to click once be became more aggressive,4
Jokes aside Rajput executed the plan well,11

"SRKKR came out to sit, now he‚Äôll go back in",2

Why do they pick Morgan with 120 strike rate . Was always a backup player in IPL. Evin lewis Colin munro alex hales all better than him,-7
What is a par score on this ground?,6
Gentle reminder that redditor has hit six archer in WC Final,11

"Abhinav Mukund is just 30. Crazy, isn't it?",5
"Just turned the stream back on, checked Jofra's overs man is on fire today !!",3
What happened to Russel? I went to feed the cat :|,3
Morgan should bat higher up the order. KKR should be looking for him to play the role Kane does for SRH.,6
"Some observations about IPL:

1) Rajasthan are by far the best dressed team. Hot pink and royal blue with white graphics, absolutely stunning fashion design here. I'm not man enough to wear pink, but I'd proudly wear their uniform

2) Staying with the sartorial analysis, Kolkata are the only team who pull off gold with even a shred of decency. Them aside, all the uniforms with gold on them look absolutely hideous. I point blank refuse to ever watch anything involving Mumbai, because I want to spare my eyes of the torture of that gold cringe

3) This is why you don't want to send Russell up the order. If he comes in at 6 or 7 with 4 or 5 overs to go, 24 (14) is a brilliant innings for that role. For a number 4 however you've got to stay out there for at least 20, 25 balls. Now I see the temptation, which is that if Russell faces that many he's going to have 60 to his name, but I don't think he's got the game to face that many balls on a consistent basis",12
Lazy swing cummo,4
This is a paper thin batting lineup. No depth at all.,2

"If RR really send Archer and Tewatia to open, I'll change my flair to RR for the rest of IPL 2020.",4
Wish life had growth like Sourav Ganguly's hair,2
What is the possibility of artificially generating rain in Dubai?,2
Downvoter ur not getting sex tonight üôÑ,2
Cummins to smash Archer for 4 sixes.,1
Bowling Jof out?,1
"Morgan NEEDS to build innings now, should have sent him earlier than Kartik !",2
Sadly there is no Bumrah on the other side for Cummins to tonk for 4 sixes. /s,8
Give an over to tewatia.,1
"God, the last 3 over can be carnage",3
What in the Ashes is this,1
Jofra vs Rabada. Who will win?,0
KKR should stop using Narine as an opener.  Hasn't worked this season. They should bring in Tripathi,2
Cummins vs Archer !!!!!,1
"I have a little wash of calmness whenever I see Eoin Morgan on my screen.

It doesn‚Äôt matter who he‚Äôs playing for or even if he‚Äôs playing cricket at all, he pops up and I just think ‚Äòtoday‚Äôs going to be fine‚Äô.",3
How does Morgan have amazing stats but is garbage every time I see him?,2
"Archer is on damn fire today, I‚Äôm in love",7
Morgan counting fielders reminds me of the time he got caught trying to slog an Australian bowler only to tell the umpire that there were 6 fielders outside the circle. Ultimate power move.,7
"Kkr should use only mavi or nagarkoti.

Bring tripathi and use narine when spinners operate.",2
Please Archer finish with less than 10 runs,2
"Morgan's batting out of position so captain DK can assert dominance

He's not a finisher and doesn't generally have the ability to hit from ball 1",1
Travis Scott gives his captian zero fucks,2
England Bowler bowling to an England batsmen and wickets kept by an England keeper,6
"In T20 you can play out best bowlers and attack the easy ones.

Unless you are Delhi Capitals, then you attack the only bowler you are not supposed to attack.",11

I think it's time for Banton to come in,6
Wtf Cummins hit my god for four üò†üò†üò†,8
Not to be a downer but has IPL posted any updates about Covid 19 tests after the CSK fiasco?,2
Take that jof,2
Cummo smashed Joffra for a four lol,3
Does Archer want to get dropped? Bowling bouncers at your national team captain...,1
Wanted KKR to win to balance the points table but they're probably gonna lose due to retarded team selection and batting order,1
Joffra Archer reminds me of myself in my younger days.,-1
Cummins ruining everything for Archer,3
Random question : Is there a hat-trick every season ?,1
"Cummo and ruining great bowling figures

What a love story",2
To think that these two were going all out on each other and now Smith is captaining archer and there combo is giving other teams nightmares,2
Cumgod you beauty.,2
"Which bowlers have gone for more than 50 runs this IPL? Steyn, Cottrell, Ngidi, Curran, Chawla, shami, Pattinson, Zampa

EDIT: Cummins only bowled 3 overs for 49",2
Cunts > Poms,0
Apparently all World Cup winning captains suffer from the same problem in IPL 2020,3
I am loving the role reversal. Smith and Archer plotting for Morgan and Cummins,7
The problem is KKR depends on Dre rus too much. He is a hit and miss player. Yes he had a great season last year.,1
Cummins should open the batting,2
How long until we refer to him as Australian all-rounder Pat Cummins.,3
Cumdog making me cum,0
Morgan needs to play till last ball or KKR will not even score 160 from here.,1
Next kkr approach : send Cummins to open.,8
"Some real abysmal batting today. Barring Gill, everyone's looked so off",3
Is that Curran!?,1
Spoiled Jof's figures,6
Tom Curran the mole.,2
Noooo that ruined his figures,6
Budget Curran Arjun!,2
Cummins was shit when batting for Australia how is he suddenly god here?,7
Morgan should have been sent over Russel and Karthik,3
"Tom Curran dropping Morgan and giving him 6 to secure his place in the limited overs sides

Smart move",11
Jofra got a parting gift,2
That‚Äôs unlucky Archer should‚Äôve had 3-12,11
Tom Curran in for next series,6
Pooran would have caught that.,6
Curran dropping his international captain,9
I am worried about other overs left of fast bowlers now .,6
Classic shot from Morgs,5
Curran brothers are horrible boundary riders.,5
just when my dad starts lauding archer‚Äôs figures.. this happens,4
Curran didn't want Morgan to feel too bad so gave him a consolation six,5
All ex KKR players still helping us so far,3
Pat Cummins scored more than DK in 3 inns.,6
"Amazing, 3 English players involved in that ball, none of them actually from England",41
Sensing 175 on the cards.,3
Tom Curran remembered who his real captain is.,6
Last over goes for 14 and still finishes with figures of 2-18,2
"It was all English. Batting, bowling, fielding last ball",5
"Nothing is an unachievable score from here. Having said that, 40 runs in 3 overs will give KKR bowlers sufficient room to operate within.",2
Tom curran caught the ball and remembered he has to play under Morgan after 6 weeks.,14
Murugan should come at 3,4
Why does Warnie look so overly worried?,6
Can they get 200 from here? 2 Curran and 1 Unadkat overs to go lmao,3
someone tell that RR dummy to not pull the mask down when speaking.,3
"IF YOU REMOVE YOUR MASK TO SPEAK, IT DEFEATS THE POINT OF THE MASK YOU IDIOT",50
Warnie's dipshit friend Sam Newman will disown Warnie for wearing a mask,4
Right so Warne‚Äôs getting paid to do nothing?,9
"I miss having super fast bowlers like Akhtar, Lee, Tait.",8
Outside the box? High profile bubble? That's a bunch of waffle,7
Curran gifting full toss to Eoin to get a chance in LOIs,10
"As an England fan, I‚Äôm very conflicted right now.",21
KKR might not retain DK next year right?,2
Curran just tryna make sure the captain picks him. Drops him and then goes gives him a full toss,6
170 would be tough to chase,1
Curran handing out loopy full tosses to Morgs just to make sure his ODI place is secure...,1
"After that drop Archer will go back to bowling 130 next match

deflated Jofra",4
"Saw Curran smiling after dropping the  catch and after the camera was on him, he suddenly changed his expressions

Fixed?",-7
"decent day for joffra, 2-18 bowling and 104\* opening the batting.",19
"High performance bubble.

Yikes.",3
Less than 5 an over and 2 wickets. Jofra is already the MOTM. Don't @ me.,1
Lol even Gavaskar commenting on Tom Curran pleasing his real captain,3
Gavaskar thinks English bowlers are going easy on Morgan.,3
when does Ben Stokes return,1
"Tom isn't as good as his younger brother, IMO",2
I'm so happy that Mark Nicholas is here. He's the only remaining link to ashes 05.,3
205 would be really tough to chase on this pitch.,1
Kkr batting looks a bit weak maybe the inclusion of Banton might help,2
RR is looking good. So they may be runners up after Delhi this season.,4
Shane warne in a high performance bubble wearing an S&M mask .. you cannot make these things up !,5
Fair Play award has to be the most pointless award in any international league ever,9
I like this mask design with the neck belt. Where can I get one like that?,3
Some slower full tosses and Curran might just guarantee his place in England,8
Hope Sanju isn't hurt,13
He hit his head hard on the ground,5
Brilliant catch.,2
"That's a top catch

Looks like he hit his head quite hard",8
whoa!,2
Kkr are fked lol,4
"All the absolute shit fielding and then catching a blinder..

What is this",9
"Eoin Morgan is an Irishman

He played for his country and then betrayed them to join England

With his leadership, he won them the World Cup which no one else could

His bat sponsor is CA

CA is mostly used by Pakistani cricketers and some shitty West Indies batsmen in the past

CA is a Pakistani sporting company

CA also stands for Cricket Australia

It's confirmed. Eoin Morgan is an agent of Cricket Australia. 

Hence Proved!

Edit: pls sub to my devintart",25
Sanju is one of the best Indian fielder currently,8
Goddamn Sanju,9
Damn The Bully gone. Clearly 50 runs reduced from the total.,6
He was able to take that catch because Kohli changed his diet. Thanks Koach!!,10
Steve Smith has clearly heard all the Sky Sports chat about bowling Jofra Archer in short spells. I hope he replaces Joe Root as England captain.,12
Sanju is a fuckin legend,13
Outstanding catch. Looks like he banged his head hard.,14
Holy shit that catch,7
Bye bye cumdog,9
sanju my boiiiii,12
Brilliant grab,6
Concussion catch,5
"Next time you see that RR pink mask, imagine a ball gag beneath that mask.


you are welcome!",7
"Can you imagine Bumrah being decent with the bat, forget prolific. It amazes me that the best bowlers of other countries are actually handy with the bat. Cummins, Archer, Starc. SENA teams have evolved faster than us in that regard. Maybe with next generation bowlers, we will see the change as well. No wonder in test cricket, we struggle to get the tail out while effectively batting with 8 batsmen. Our tail is always come and go.",11
2 more overs and only 1 batter left. proper bungling from kkr.,1
Upcoming approach to cricket : all players should be trained wicketkeepers !!,6
Shit. I hope Sanju is alright. That looked like a massive blow to the head.,8
"**17.6** Curran to Cummins, OUT, **taken at deep backward square by Samson.** **149-6**

What a üêàch.,2
Oh my god! Hope he's alright. Great catch!,7
Sanju Samson making it seem like the catch was very difficult. Like overselling a move in WWE,2
Hopefully Samson‚Äôs alright I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing him bat. Hoping they open with him.,11
Sanju Samson holding onto that ball like his life depended on it,13
I think I love sanju,10
"Samson can't bat now because of the concussion

fucking Tom Curran is at it again",4
"Finally,the Ana De Armas ad.",3
would you rather face an over of Joffra and not get out or bowl to Buttler and go for less than 24 to save your families life?,8
Where is that guy who made a thread on potential Indian wicketkeepers claiming Sanju is not a good fielder?,13
Are spectators allowed in the stadium? Why are there kids there?,3
We are the most fucked team this season.,4
Why tf is BCCI chief pimping for a stupid mobile app?,21
Hope he's ok and that doesn't affect his batting,4
"I enjoy Mark Nicholas, I will say however, I reckon by this point everyone has a pretty decent handle on how dangerous Morgan can be...

Not sure anyone in the world is watching Eoin walk out and thinking ‚Äòahh this ones over lads, we‚Äôve won it.‚Äô",4

Who is the better keeper? Sanju or Rahul?,1
By this rate Ganju is going to be the MVP of this year's IPL,1
IIRC Nagarkoti played as a bowling all-rounder during the U19 WC. He made some useful contributions too with the bat,5
Lol I've never heard real fans chant Halla bol but here we are,4
Man nagarkotti can bat too...,6
"So, Nagarkoti is a batting all-rounder!!",1
Brilliant,1
B A T  D E E P,3
Do you agree with Gavaskar's opinion that Morgan should replace DK as a captain?,6
That's a good cricket shot. I'm genuinely surprised,4
It astonishes me how many teams can use a Joe Root but no one buys him lol.,11
Samson Adipoli!!!!!,10
Nagarkoti now has scored more than DK in his last 2 games..,5
I noticed there have been hardly any direct hits this IPL in the field,5
KKR should try opening with Nagarkoti instead of Narine,1
KKR just needs Madhuri to get back into form with the bat and their troubles would be solved. He has been such a beast for them the last 2 years. Russel is a T20 legend.,4
Surprised that Tewaria only bowled 1 over,8
Why is Unadkat even playing?! Just play another batsman instead of him,5
"Dae feel Nagarkotti and Mavi only come together, like whenever one of them is mentioned, the other one comes in the mind automatically.",3
Is Reddit acting up for anyone else today?,7
Nagarkoti is a good runner,5
Wtf is Morgan doing ?,13
Cummins better do an Archer while bowling!,7
WHERE IS THE INTENT FROM MORGAN REEEEEEE,10
Mahendra Singh Morgan,10
Nehra's style of speaking reminds me of that over-confident classmate who is always relaxed before exams even though he hasn't studied a bit. Nothing stresses him out.,6
Download cred baby üò£üò†,2
KKR needs at least 175 on this pitch because Cumdog is gonna go for 3-1-10-1 in first spell only to go for 25 in his last over to lose the match. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,4

Morgan time to do a Tewatia,2
For how long Hardik was hiding behind the chair?,1
Morgan tank some mate,3
At what point does Delhi say fuck it and play all four spinners? I am very much looking forward to that.,4
KKR is giving me last season Brisbane Heat vibes.,3
I like how KKR have somehow still managed to shithouse their way to 160ish,9
Can gandguly stop promoting apps now,4
So good to see that all these new generations bowlers are decent at batting as well unlike before,2

That was fucking brutal,2
Dhogan,1
Must be the wicket and the boundary sizes. Howz RR gonna adjust to this?,2
"Why was Tewatia given only 1 over ?

He took 1 wicket and gave 6 runs. Surely could have given him an over after Russell was dismissed.",5
 Curran > Curran,9
"No one:

Absolutely no one:

"If Curran ambled in casually like Jofra Archer, would his stock ball clock over 110 kmph?",2
Did Curran let the ball go through him?,7
Everyone here is busy jinxing RR. Let us have this one please,3
Quandary for Morgan. He doesn't want to hit his England teammate out of the IPL. He needs them to get this experience.,3
Why did Curran not collect it lmao,7
Morgan is a big dick player.,5
Abe Curran chutie wtf u doing,0
Curran‚Äôs been shite,2
"Don't bother skipper, I will bowl a wide",2
Morgan captaincy when KKR? Dump that guy DK!,8
Morgan is absolutely wasted being made to bat 6,10
"How is it irrelevant Mark? If he runs him out there they get a run less, could be the difference",5
Look at Morgan‚Äôs backlift,3
That's harsh,5
Tom Curran has never been not smashed in his 8 IPL games so far.,7
"Unpopular here, but I think this is Morgan making sure they play the full quota of 20 overs",7
Tom aur Sam ka naam curran kisne kiya?,4

Umpire doing it for the memes now lmao,7

He's literally standing outside off!,3
"Good finishing from Morgan, jokes aside. Take your side to 170-175 instead of risking not making even 160 in the hunt for 185-190.",3
Tom curran no need to get scared from your captain,3
"Curran be like : ""who the fuck is the 1st umpire?""",3
That's just way too wide,1
Eoin Morgan moved too much this should not have been wide,2
Over declare,2
Baby over,3
Dude stop bowling outside off. Morgan is exposing his stumps,5
Tom always looks like he's about to cry,5
Mark Nicholas blasts a recording he did of the entirety of the Hamlet script when he jerks off,2
Scenes if Butler stands upto Curran and calls Morgan Knobhead,7
"RR should send Tom to  the KKR after the match

follow your captain Tom",2
Curran has lost it. needed him to fetch a wicket in the last over,1
That a wide?,1
Curran bowls wider and wider and stares at umpire for giving it wide .,3
Shit umpiring,-1
Curran making runs for KKR,1
now this is absolute spot fixing,-11
"If it was Sam Curran and his beautiful face and hair, Umpire wouldn't have given wide.",12
Took him 4 tries but he got it,6
The upmire's outfit is absolutely attrocius..Could the font for Paytm be any bigger,3
1 six and it's a mighty respectable total for KKR.,2
Get it out of the park mate,1
Why are they acting so shocked about those wides lol the last one was even outside the second white line,1
"Ex-KKR Bois helping us today. Robbie, Tom nice one lads.",6
Iam surprised Buttler is keeping well.,5
Curran having a meltdown rn.,5
"Fear not TC, I too bowl 10 ball overs",12
Ump: You're a bowler? Well fuck you and your mum bitch!!!,1
Your brother is better than you mate,11
"I just want KKR to win by 3 runs, for those 3 back to back wides",8
"KKR didn't get the momentum still ending up with 170+ , it's been a high scoring ipl.",3
"lol nice to see English Bowler, batsman & Wicket keeper.",10
That 5th ball is 5 runs,3
TC spooked by Morgs,3
Sad that Tom is doing quite badly this IPL. Kinda rate him highly,4
Why the fuck is DK standing at dugout?,3
Dambass,1
That's the third 2 they've ran this over.,3
"I've said it before and I'll say it again. Curran is such a mixed bag at the death

He's either perfectly execting cutters and yorkers or bowling absolute filth that gets smacked around. Have a guess at which one we're getting right now",11
"This is the most depressing fact about Delhi if there is ever one:

  - Second IPL: Delhi topped the table and lost the semi final to fourth placed Deccan chargers. So they changed the rules to make it almost impossible for third or fourth team to win.

 - A later IPL: Delhi finished in top 2 and proceeded to lose both their matches in the playoffs.

Lol.",29
"Despite regular fall of wickets they reached 170+

Competitive score this.

Man Curran is persistent bowling there only, nice.",12
Both sides would be happy I guess.,5
"Hopefully KKR realise that by sending Narine up the order, they're reducing the number of balls that their Middle Order is facing.",20
"‚ÄòPsst Tom, get us up too 175 and I‚Äôll let you open the bowling for England‚Äô - Eoin Morgan....probably.",12

Hat trick!!!!!!,2
Beautiful contest,1
"Umpire to Curran - ""No Tom Eoin is my captain""",9
"Ok so the warm up is done, waiting for my lords Archer and Tewatia to open",8
"Morgan didn't run off the last ball, chose his average instead

What would Malan say?

(There was absolutely no run there but agenda gotta agenda)",11
175 to win. Will get to see some fight.,2
Why didn't Unadkat bowl full 4 overs?,7
All that for a dot,8
Morgan not sacrificing himself on the last ball? Hope Malan never talks to him again,37
Last 2 balls were great. Tom Curran cricket career still has hope.,7
SRK at the ground üòç,2
If Malan or Hales or someone didn't run there Morgan would have gone berserk,23
GREAT BOWLING THOUGH! WHAT A STUBBORN HE IS!!!,11
SRK has grown his hair long like his younger days,9
It was so worth those 3 wides to finally get a Yorker that goes for 2,12
"Guys, not everything is spot fixing or match fixing

People are capable of just bowling bad balls or having bad games",13
"Good stuff from Morgan, still should have come at 4",8
So Jofra and Tewatia to open?,13
Morgan is far too low down the batting order in my opinion.,19
Gill looks like a token morally good transgender character in indian soaps.,-1
How come Morgan didn't run last ball,8
Par score imo,10
Tripathi would do the same job as Morgan and free up an overseas slot,-1
"Remember Morgan once saying that some players are trying to save thier average and hence don't take  the risky run on the last ball. 
It was aimed at Malan I believe. 

Why didn't he not run now lmao",14
"Yo, where can i watch yesterday's srh v DC match, not the highlights, entire match????",3
How did we end up with 174 though.,9
Competitive total imo,6
"Genuinely, watching people not wearing masks properly is so annoying",11
Too many Poms this match ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢,-3
When you pay crores for Unadkat but don't even finish his quota...,7
Nagarkoti be like finally i got to something other than fielding.,21
"We should not shit on Tom Curran too much, he is relatively new he still has chance to get better with time. We shit on him like he is Umesh, Unadkat.",1
"When you're playing with only 5 proper batsmen and lose your first 5 wickets in 14-15 overs, ending up with 174 is a really good effort.

This can definitely be defended. Morgan played a responsible and mature knock and gave his team a chance instead of throwing away his wicket and KKR ending up with 148 odd.",46
"It's time DK accepts his role as finisher in KKR batting order and let Morgan and Russell play ahead of him..selfless act but needed for team to get 20,30 extra runs.",23
What's the odds of defending this? 10-15%?,1
"Bit of a meh innings from Morgan really. Feel like he's wasted at 6, should be at 4 imo",10
Who all need exactly 175 runs by RR to get that Zomato credit? Lol,10
"Daily reminder to upvote this thread


And stay hydrated",6
Way too many wides. 9 I think? That's gonna cost us,6
Rabada will easily win in a fist fight with Jofra,5
*cries in the corner and whispers to myself*   Tom Curran is a good death bowler,7
Even Andrew Tye could bowl better than that,3
Every time I hear Archer's voice I'm surprised,3
"Even when majority of our batting flopped

We got 175",14
One of best middle order batsman gets only 23 balls to face.,12
sanju alone can chase 50% of the score here.,1
Is Stonks back for the next RR game?,1
Try to get 180+ runs and getting only 150 isn't really called showing intent.,5
Last over was pretty decent minus the wides,4
How come Morgan dissed Malan when they both play for Middlesex,1
Inb4 RR choke,2
How is Jofra able to generate so much pace and heavy balls with such a lanky body?,2
"Morgan is a hypocrite, gave Dawid Malan so much shit for not running last ball.",5
We got this in the bag! Cmon you Royals!,1
Everyone I've seen Tom Curran bowl for England or Rajasthan I see him get smashed or go for loads. It annoys me to see him be so out of form and still be in the teams at the moment. I want him back to his 2017/2018 form,10
Hate me but i still think tewatia's inning was a fluke,12
Why has Brett Lee painted his face silver? Too much makeup?,3
"IMO, if KKR are gonna play Morgan that low and not give him the captaincy either, they'd probably be better off playing Banton over him, and demote Narine down the order. Gill and Banton is their best Opening pair.",2
UAE. KKR captain struggling to get runs. Team opening combo messed up. This is 2014 all over again.,9
"Tewatia to score 175 today

Don't @ me",11
"Rahul Tewatia

Archer

Jos Butler

Ankit Rajpoot

Samson

Tom Curran

H???

Aaron

N????",2
DK doesn't even have a captain's personality. Watching him stand there alone in the dugout doesn't give a good vibe. KKR need to be brave and make Morgan the captain. He has won the WC ffs and built a team that's innovative and plays damn attractive cricket!,11
"I missed the first few overs, just saw Narine has scored 15 of 14 balls!!

Do people still support his promotion?",6
DK is one of the most beta captains I've seen,6
KKR has to be one of the most balanced team with great depth in batting. Unfortunately bringing Sunil Narine as the opener messes up everything. Don't ruin this team please.,5
"Cummins gets buttler in his first spell

We win",1
Hope Jos gets going today,5
Embarrassing that Brett Lee is being asked to talk about SRK in the half-time show. GTFO.,7
I am not even commenting about the match because its a foregone conclusion. RR have too much class in the batting to lose this one.,0
Smith will be crucial on this large ground,3
"Why Unadkat RR(that too in crores, Jimmy Neesham went for 50 lakhs only ffs) despite last years debacle , you can't even let him complete his spell !",3
DK could not hold onto his wife and they expect him to hold onto a whole team.,-22
"DK needs to know his place at number 6. I get that you won't score much runs at 6, but the team is so much more important than personal stats DK.",7
Sad to see RR has to select Robbie over Jaiswal because Smith wants to open,9
RR going to bottle it up big time.,2
Kkr or rr ?,2
KKR should open with Banton for no other reason than me wanting to see an exciting young batsmen rather than an old spin bowler try and slog every ball,8
"uh, share the load around?",2
Upvote if you want DK to remain captain and downvote if you want Morgan to be captain,-18
"Anyways, it was great to see SRK cheering for KKR in the stadium. Hope we win, and see his epic celebrations.",2
"Its time to move on from Narine experiment. Let DK open with Gill and Morgan at 4, Russel at 5. I think they need to play another batsman instead of Narine in the middle order. Kuldeep and Varun C can take care of spin bowling needs. Though not sure who among the reserves are a good fit. May be Banton as overseas batsman would be a big boost.",5
Narayan Narayan only he can stop RR,3
"Guessed it right!!

"RR twitter is liar, I'm never putting that filthy RR flair on",18
"I think DK wants to score a lot and play for Indian national team, so he is promoting himself. I don't think he should get a game for India again, we have younger and more dynamic players to groom instead of holding on to the past",5
Smith vs Cummies is so conflicting,11
"No offence to Lord Tewatia, but I'm hoping we don't get to see him in the middle today. Just Smithy (75\*) and Buttler (100\*) carrying their bats.",9
Cummins with the fresh mullet,3
Cummins looks like he wants to play on the wing for the Cronulla Sharks with that haircut. Wouldn't look out of place.,2
"Ha bhai hum to chutie hain jo naukri karte hain, MPL khelna nahi ata",3
Both Smith and Samson is more effective at 3 than any other batting position. That's why Smith needs to open.,2
Open with narine n cummins fuckers,2
Lmao Buttler tall af,2
KKR fans are the worst among entire IPL fandoms.,4
That tweet got over 3000 RTs. Where are Jofra and Tewatia RR?,9
"Honestly don't understand how DK promoting himself made any difference to the number of deliveries Morgan faced. At most, Morgan could have played 3 more deliveries.",2
Narine living the dream - batting bhi me karunga bowling bhi pehlee dalunga,8
KKR under a different captain would be a force to reckon with. Right now they're great on paper but don't look cohesive. Somehow it reminds me of the Buchanan days.,6
"Kohli, Iyer, Karthik. Dhoni have been complete shit with the bat.",7
Morgan should be captain. How is this even an opinion? Do you guys not watch Cricket outside IPL or some shit.,13
Sunil Narine opening both batting and bowling. Gully cricket move,15
I think Cummins should bowl with his cap on,14
"Nairne opening the batting as well as bowling

He definitely owns both the bat as well as the ball. Atleast Gully was like this only :P",2

Vodafone Idea ads are the least impactful ads I've seen in a long time,5
State of that hair,5
They have like 12 fast bowlers and they give new ball to spinner!,7
Sunil Narine is so indifferent that he looks like life has been sucked out of him by being forced to watch sweaty Dean Elgar and Rory Burns make out after batting the whole day to nurdle their way to 100* off 270 deliveries each.,9
Patrick wtf is that hair?,8

Is pat cummins worth the money?,2
Smith vs Cummins!!! No idea whom to root for,4
Can I get an F for having Dinesh Karthik as my fantasy captain. WTF Dinesh bhai - I was not even watching this game.,4
Someone eating their fucking dinner on comms? Keep hearing knife and fork clattering on a plate,3
Steve smith vs pat Cummins yeah bring it on,3
Why do people have such massive expectations from Dhoni ? I don't remember many 40 years olds dominating IPL.,5
Really appreciate Star Sports making an entire set dedicated to Deano. I hope they make it a permanent fixture for the Dugout and not just for this IPL.,5

Was that a good bowl or your usual SPD crab dancing?,5
Same old Aussies??!,2
That's a 'passed out before we left to go to the bar' haircut if I've ever seen one,5

"On unrelated note, Ana de Armas looks so good in Natural Diamonds ad. Too bad, diamonds are a scam.",3
Smithy pls calm down,1
Smith getting put off by Cumdog's beautiful eyes and who can blame him,2
Cummins getting $8000 every ball....no pressure son.,3
I wish RR wins I‚Äôll get ‚Çπ200 from Zomato if I‚Äôm right.,1
This is the first time Steve Smith has ever faced Pat Cummins in a professional match,5
"This ain't Sharjah, Smudge",1
Cummins could bring down Smith's Test average if he got the chance too,2
Smith looks rusty now,0
Pollard would have taken that,3
How's that nearly gone for 6? Thought it had gone straight up for Cummins to take,1
What do they mean by its a difficult ground to take catches?,6
"Interesting. Smith is very uncomfortable against Cummins

As I type this : he is out",5

Ugliest Smith innings I have ever watched.,24
Cummins firing up nicely,2
Beautifully placed Smithy,2
"Other teams: We have proper quicks like Archer, Shami and Cummins who are doing very well this season

RCB: Best I can do is Udana bro",3
Now that one is out.,6
Very odd innings from Smith,7
Lucky there Smith.,2
Smith was living a charmed life there.,6
Smith's looking at dressing room for reviewing,2
Smith is very good at acting innocent. That sly cunt,10
Smith was distracted by that hair cut,8
Wtf was Smith trying to do,5
Smith is playing so uncharacteristically,9
HEYYY,0
Maybe the three worst consecutive balls I‚Äôve seen Steve Smith Play,10
Such a weird innings from Smith.. hell bent on getting out.,7
Is this hope that I feel?,3
Smith is such a dork ü§£,5
What in the fuck was that innings? Has Smithy got another headknock?,3

Wtf was that innings lmao,3
My god that was a top notch over by a top notch bowler. SPD never looked comfy against The Bully.,1
This games fixed.. srk in the crowd,0
Wtf was that now?,3
Wtf has Smith against Cummins? He could have just played the over out. What the fuck? Lol,9
Smith just loves Cummins so much,3
Is smith okay ?,5
This was a very uncharacteristic inning from Smith. Never seen him bat this clumsy.,3
Curran dropped Morgan but Cummins dismissed Smith,5
Cummins is ruining everything with that hair,4
Not sure what Smith was doing there. Couldn't have just knocked it around and taken his team victory. Such an odd innings.,3
Smith didn't look at all comfortable,3
Is smith concussed still,5
Holy shit why was he batting like a tailender!,2
Scratchy from Smith. Not sure what his plan was,2
Well that was a peculiar innings,7
"**1.6** Cummins to Smith, OUT, **given out caught behind now. Smith looks confused, has a chat with Jos, and then walks off.** **15-1**

SPD Smith c &dagger;Karthik b Cummins 3 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85",3
"Pat come in

Batsman goes out",7
Cummins could have gotten a hatrick of Smith there,9
That was about as ugly an innings as the one he played after returning from being hit on the head during the ashes.,11
Smith did not look at all comfortable,4
Jofra at 3? üò≥üò≥,5
Smith looked rusty today.,5
Smith shots look so ugly sometimes when he gets out. Felt like a tailender whaling for a couple of deliveries there,6
Is it normal to dislike the cred ad judges for not appreciating the Bappi Lahiri guy?,5
Looking forward to Samson vs Cummins,2
Cummo going to have some bragging rights heading into the Aus summer,6
Well that was... weird...,9
"Ugliest batting I've seen for a while, and I'm not even talking about his technique.",3
Who was the wise ass commentator saying batsman have edge over their teammate bowlers?,2
[deleted],3
You shouldn't open with a leg spinner against the number 1 ranked test bowler,11
What the hell was that from Smith? Looked 10 times worse than Narine,8
Seemed like smith was tryna chase 220 odd today as well,7
Sanju Samson this year is what we have hoped Pant will be,3
Steve Sharjah Smith.,9
thats such a confusing knock from smith. It looked like he was chasing 250 there,8
"Continuity error: in side view the woman is wearing glasses in cred ad, in front view she's not",2
Smith can't have Kohli being he only one with single digits scores. Has to try and outdo him,10
"Fair to say, Cummins won that battle by a margin. Smith didn't play a single ball confidently.",5
I am pretty sure Tom Curran did the haircut for Cummins.,1
Smith must have really needed to go to the loo.. That is the only logical explanation for that innings!,8
Smith looked like how he batted after coming out to bat after the concussion at Lords.,8
dang I missed Smith throwing his wicket.,3
I feel like a royal collapse incoming,4
Bro is smith ok,6
Ah yes the famed SS!,1
That was really  sloppy,1
Samson is already over his quota of insane innings per IPL.,11
It's hard to bat against your crush.,17
"If we remove Sanju and Jos in the first 10, we might have a pretty good chance.",6
Sriri Mama sends his regards.,5
Smith was trying and failing to emulate his batting hero El Boulto,5
"Just get buttler out

N we win the game easy",5
Smith had order to out and slog.,2
Pat Cummins got a hair cut from Sunil Narine's barber.,5
"Bhagwan ke taraf dekh ke bowling karne wala aa gaya.

T - don't worry, it's a lame comment.",1
Smith just trying to cause a collapse so Tewatia can come in and save the day.,29
Smith making sure Lord Tewatia has the chance to perform again,11
Imagine thinking you have a chance with Tewatia still in the shed.,5
"Say whatever you want, this shit looks fixed. 

And this is the first time I am putting this publicily",-6
Lmao why was Smith battling like a tailender?,7
Smith was swinging like I do in the Ashes 17 game where I get frustrated and try and smack everything but end up getting out,7
Cummins got rich man's haircut. Obviously none of us can understand its glory.,11
Yeh khiladi khaas hai,1
Smith was batting as if they are chasing 200+. No idea why he was so desperate. Could have just milked Cummins,6
Can't blame Smith there. Even Don Bradman would have been unsettled after looking at Cummins' hair.,8
Sanju and Butler feels like a foreboding partnership.,4
Samson doesn't mind a firsrt boundary,2
Big Dick Samson will win it easily.,3
Damn Samson just started where he left off,3
"I mean, it was in the slot.",2
[deleted],6
It‚Äôs evident Samson needs to be in Indian XI. Where do you play him?,5
"Such a shame that samson gets off the mark with a 4

Where is ur trademark 6",8
Is Smith's role pinch hitter?,9
"Still can't understand that Smith Innings.

They're not chasing a mammoth total, this was set up perfectly for a run a ball or so 50 from Smith to chase it down calmly. But he was trying to smash every single delivery as though he had somewhere else to be.

Very odd",14
I have no idea why was Smith acting so restless. It was only first over and the score they are chasing is 170 and not 200+. I don't get it.,10
IPL is not fixed. Delhi has been too bad for it to be fixed.,2
Even a defensive stroke from Sanju looks so good,6
"Cummins has Zampa's trim on one side and Sunil Narine's on the other, homage to his two lovers.",13
I don't remember the last time an MI batsman was in Orange cap chase.,7
Kyle Mills: thighsum thunderum,3
WTF happened to David Hussey?,3
"Just Imagine, 2020 is the year where Samson is going  to be consistent like we wanted?",4
Strange that everyone is tryna go too hard,2
Why did Styris and Lee not answer Badri's (somewhat decent) question. I'm confused,4
RR's batting is too light for this sort of chase.,3
Feeling like RR gonna shit outside Sharjah,3
Samson will be tested today to see if he can play a safe innings and build a partnership and not let everything loose like Pant.,4
"Me: I'm afraid of the Backstreet Boys  
  
My therapist: Tell me why",8
Really wanted to see Smith score 50 out of 40 runs.,1
Cud be match deciding over this,1
"KKR's training kit looks so good, exactly opposite of their playing kit which is so fucking gaudy.",6
I want to see Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope in the IPL. Both entertaining to watch.,8
How much you think dugout guys are getting paid?,1
[removed],3
Buttler and every other batsmen should retire hurt so I can watch Jof hit some big dingers.,13
Such uncharacteristic of Smith. Played the same shot the entire over!,5
Andre Russell diving.,1
Samson scores giroud looking runs.,-1
"I think RR feel this pitch will get difficult to bat on and this are trying to score in PP. That's the only explanation I can think of for that weird as Smith ""innings""",7
Beautiful drive!,3
can‚Äôt consider cummins ‚Äúexciting‚Äù when he‚Äôs got that haircut,9
"Sanju vs Cummo, boisss",2
Archer is gonna win that poll 90-10,3
"Bowler: gets wicket on the last ball of the over

Advertisers: that's not very Cash Money of you",7
Great day for fans of good line and length fast bowling delivered by overseas bowling allrounders,3
The next step after reduction of balls in cricket and reaching 0 balls (coin toss decides winer) is negative number of deliveries. We remove deliveries one by one from the official records and continue till 1700s when the first game of cricket was played.,6
Archer teaching unadkat how to bowl and unadkat teaching Archer how to celebrate,11

Butler you beast.,3
"Can we just acknowledge how useless Unadkat must be feeling rn, after bowling only two overs.",5
Oh god Buttler that is filth,7
Exactly why butler is do dangerous,2
That shoulder shimmy from Buttler as the bowler ran in üòç,3
[deleted],2
Butler has so much time,2
Cummo being good butler being extra good,4
Why was Smith playing so carelessly? That little innings was so uncharacteristic by him.,5
Samson-Buttler is a duo I can get behind,3
"As much as I like Nagarkoti and want him to succeed, I question the need to have him in the side when you already have Mavi and Russell to support Cummins. I'd rather they bring in an extra batsman cause Cummins cannot be coming in at 7.",3
"Let's go boys, Chase it down",2
Jos Buttler when batting against Cummins become Josh Buttler. He is too good against Lord Cumdaddy,5
"I get it now, the god-awful trim is Cummins' way of signalling that he'll be Samson's Delilah. Very poetic Patty.",1
Beautiful Jos,3
**STUPID SEXY JüòçS**,10
"Patrick ""Dwight Schrute"" Cummins",2
Still can't believe the fastest bowler at present Mark Wood went unsold.,6
"Let's not over analyse why Smith did what he did, he's definitely off his rocker and simply wanted to do his best Chris Martin impression.",5
UNIVERSE JOS,7
"Sunil gaveskar just said the same thing about Smith as what I noticed. Smith acting desperate and trying to play all the ridiculous shots possible which was not required. It was as if he was trying to give away the wicket. Very disappointing.
Edit: If Narine had done this I would have understood but not a sane batsman like Smith.",9
Robin Utthappa with a shower cap,2
"Steve Smith just wanted to show who is the boss, but Cumdog came on top to prove who is the real *daddy*!",2

There goes Samson.,1
I am dead inside,1
"Hindi commentators saying , ""bouncer tha teekha wala"" ..was it bouncer or golgappa ..
Hope mdh daddu isnt behind this teekha shit.",1
Samson is consistent at being inconsistent,3
Honeymoon period is over for Sanju,2
YESSSS. Now you are talkingüëåüëåüëå,1
Yes! What a breakthrough.,1
One cheap Samson wicket was due..,6
Fixed,0
Fuck that's a massive wicket,4
So it comes down to tewatia again,1
Boundaries too big for Sanju too then I guess,3
Fuck yeah!!!,2
Samson has run out of his mandatory amazing performances for the season?,5
"Love you, Mavi. You beauty!",2
Too soon for Sanju Samson fOuNd OuT? /s,7
"Samson is out. I repeat, SAMSON IS OUT.",2
Foakes couldn't have scooped that,4
Back to usual. Thanks sanju,2
How come so many of @csk4lyf questions on twitter get featured on dugout?,3
"there goes Sanju ""Bradman"" Samson. F",2
Mavi doing what Gill did in the 1st innings,2
That would have been six at Sharjah,18
Lord Tewatia for the rescue,1
Excellent bowling that from Mavi. Giving no room whatsoever to swing.,2
Promote Archer you cowards,8
Lord is here.,1
You can't convince me that this is not fixed,0
"Ffs Sanju, whyyy",1
2020 finally catches up with samson,2
oh noo sanjuuuu,1
"Bet on Samson and RR, so of course they're going to fail today. My fucking luck.",7
Will lord Tewatia save us?,3
This approach by RR batsman is really hard to understand.,6
"**4.1** Shivam Mavi to Samson, OUT, **dragged to midwicket!** **30-2**

Sanju Sharjah Samson,4
Bring Tewatia already,4
"Tewatia show incoming

Edit: nvm",3
Tewatia and Buttler is the partnership we've all been waiting for,7
Never had any confidence in Samson but today for the first time selected him in my Fantasy League lmao,5
Sanju Overrated AF. Every ground isn't Sharjah,-3
I think RR still believes they're playing in Sharjah on a flat wicket,7
They are still in Sharjah mode.,6
Just bring in Lord Tewatia.,4
Fuck upgrad for one of the shittiest ad.,3
Wow into the tail already.,8
Those who were saying Sanju will hole out in the first 10 balls were spot on,4
"Silly, silly Sanju.",2
Samson shows even lesser restraint than Pant while playing. And that's saying something because Pant hardly shows any.,5
"Play as slow as u can Uthappa, we have Lord Tewathia.",1
"I feel slightly guilty for being this gleeful because Samson couldn't chop it outside of Sharjah. Fuck me, can't wait for Pant to mishit slog-sweeps out of the stadium. Don't think it means anything, but it's just such a spectacle",1
"No sharjah no party :(


Poor Samson will get only 3 matches in Sharjah",3
I wish sky wouldn't move channels mid game. It's unnecessary effort.,2
On this pitch you have to play like Pant did. This is not the same pitch that samson has been playing before,1
"This collapse isn't fixing, it's just an unfortunate side-effect of having so many English players.",5
2 minutes of silence for those who made Sanju Samson captain of their Dream11 team,7
Wicket is not completely dead. Seamers are able to generate some pace. I expect Nagarkoti to replace Cummins next over and may be even Russell coming in for few overs.,2
Jos is 78 runs away from 6000 T20 runs in his career. Can he get it tonight?,4
Wtf that's not tewatia,3
"If robin Uthappa won't perform today against his former team, he should retire imo.",2
I liked Robin Uthappa better. This Robbie guy is a faker.,5
"As a KKR fan, Uthappa at the crease gives me confidence",12
"The second best batsman of RR after Tewatia, Uthappa is here.",5
Robbie out here trying to convince us he's a changed man ever since that dubious little name change.,3
"Cummins has the wood on Smudge, he just never looked comfortable facing Cummins there. What a contest tho!",1
Uncharacteristic innings by Samson and Smith today. Maybe they're too reliant on Lord Tewatia?,3
Samson can only play at Sharjah Lol,2
Can Uthappa make KKR regret letting him go?,1
[deleted],3
Now it's upto bowlers to chase this total.,1
"But, I wanted Tewatia to come to bat...",3
SRK looks like he is filming for Don 52,3
What blashphemy! Sending Uthappa ahead of Lord Tewatia.,4
Suicidal run. Wtf is wrong with RR today. They are batting like chasing 250.,2
Ugh srk is beginning to look like a khan market Aunty,3
What SRK is in Dubai!?,2

Would love to see Buttler get a 100 here and get RR past 175,4

Feels like normal RR season. Whole team getting choked except butter.,3

"Ah yes, sky sports kicking IPL off Sky Sports Cricket to show a 5th ODI dead rubber between England and Windies. Do me a fucking favour",23

Is it just me or does morgan look really short in the field,3
Cricket is such a simple sport. A ball comes after it bounces and you smash it anywhere and you get runs,5

Butler's still leaving the non strikers crease,3
"Last game Tewatia ko bohot gaali diya. 
Iss game Uthappa ko.
See what I mean?",6
Great contest between bat & ball,2
Uthappa doing Che Pujara proud with that strike rate.,6
"Saw Cummins being trolled by a few after his first match in which he was quite expensive. Many questioned his price tag.


But great comeback by him, that's what champions are made of!!",13
Uthappa was so bad for KKR. This is the match he should really perform. Retire like Gambhir otherwise,6
Cummins looking absolutely on the money here.,2
Scenes when Kuldeep mankads Butler.,1
What's up with this DK temporary captain? Did the commentators day something?,1
Uthapa trying to do a Tewatia...,1
These are way too much bowlers. What's the point of playing chuck?,1
Buttler gone,2
Brilliant Mavi üëèüëèüëèüëè,1
Lol,1
That would have been six at Sharjah,5
Huge wicket,1
great congrats on the win kkr good game,1
That's the game done,1
Damn can't believe Pat Cummins still isn't a T20 player because of those bad couple overs in the first game. Sorry Pat,4
Why are everyone so pissed about RR trying to throw thier wickets away! They're obviously trying to bring in their best batsmen in : Rahul,5
Really Jos?,1
Is there another Indian  batsman that can replace Uthappa??,1
"Well, I can say that's the Match but but but, Lord Tewatia is still to bat..",5
MAVIIIIIII,1
"mavi is brilliant! damn, son.",1
6.1 middle overs Butler,2
MAVI!!!,1
Yessssss!,1
What a shitshow,1
"FUCK I forgot to report to Centrelink yesterday, it was the day I'm supposed to report income every fortnight 

If any Aussies are still up, first you'll understand what I'm talking about and if you've a heart feel my pain, and hopefully second set my fears at ease. I can still do it in the morning without getting fucked over right üò®",6
That's the match I think.,4
Mavi bowled really well so far and he deserved that wicket.,4
"**6.1** Shivam Mavi to Buttler, OUT, **taken at short third man!** **39-3**

JC Buttler c Varun b Shivam Mavi 21 (16b 1x4 2x6) SR: 131.25",2
Mavi is on fire üî•üî•üî•,3
Mavi. Fantastic baby.,3
I‚Äôm not watching this anymore,2
"Team of Flat track bullies lol


Someone give them sharajah's boundary size",8
Wow what a fucking anticlimactic batting from royals,3
People getting caught in slips in UAE ...am i dreaming ?,2
"Wtf was that from buttler 

Buttler serving us the game?",5
Time to shine Tewatia,3
Lmao that was casual AF,2
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!,1
So good to see Mavi taking wickets,2
Lord Tewatia incoming,2
Scenes when Tewatia and Archer put on a 100 partnership off 30 balls to win it,7
OH YEAH!!!! LET'S GO BOIIISSSS. OH WAIT... Lord Tewatia,2
So gutted :(,1
Jos wtf was that,1
Lord Tewatia chanting intensifies,4
Fuckkk!!! CSK is still at the bottom.,5
"most ~~one sided~~ boring chase in the history of ipl loading bois, kbye",2
I hype you up every match bitch... and for what,7
Pack up boys. We are done here,3
"I don't want to shit on butler, but has he ever played match winning innings while chasing ever for RR.",-1
Second one sided match after RCB-KXIP. ?,0
"This is where playing with 4-5 proper batsmen and lots of bits and pieces players hurts. 

Grounds like these you need proper batsmen and conventional cricket shots. RR need to address the balance of their team especially in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.",3
Lol RR's Tail begins,1
Smith just needed to play his typical run and ball inning and RR would have won it.  Shouldn't have try to chase 250.,1
Tewatia the only hope,3
"Ok lads , time to play for the nrr",11
Finally the stage is set for Lord Tewatia,3
"Poor planning and shot selection from RR batsman today. They literally handed over their wicket to KKR by playing poor cricketing shots. I was hoping for a close contest between the two sides. Well, I am disappointed.",1
Royals batting collapse back on the menu boys!,2
Aggressive captaincy from DK!,2
RR can't hack it on bigger grounds.,3
I think we've built a good lineup of players considering what happened last year. Bowling has gotten better for sure.  I think we gotta fix what we're doing with Narine tho.,2
"Oh Pan Parag came in instead. I'm ready for a snooezefest

Wake me up when Lord comes in",3
Riyan is kind of a cool name,1
Now the middle order of RR's lineup will be tested. Really hope Riyan Parag can do something here,2
Hopefully Jaiswal gets a game next time around,0
Where is Lord Tewatia?,2
"Night people! I guess RR will be bowled out around 130

Sharjah bullies /s",5
Mavi is a much improved player this year. Good to see.,3
"I blame all this on Tom Curran 

he ruined the momentum, if he had held on to that catch",-3
RR sad they can't play every game at Sharjah,0
"Butler is a wonderful striker of the ball, but even in his international career, he severely lacks match awareness.",1
"Swanne seems too much into Tewatia , I find it creepy .",6
Think it's time to say - why win the toss and choose to bat in this ground?,3
"Everyone saying match gone and lord Tewatia be like ""Am I a joke to you?""",1
Captain's wicket.,1
He couldn't have aimed that edge any more accurately to the fielder,3
"Why are they teasing with tewatia, send him in already",1
Match done early today,1
God KKR might just drop Kuldeep to bring in a batsmen if Varun C has another good game,1
Keep calm and believe in Tewatia,2
Man rr batting looks weak af! Sharjah masked the weakness.,0
My boy DK's captaincy is on point so far tonight and his bowlers are responding too.,3
All teams this season look decent except CSK,1
Setting the stage for Lord Tewatia.,1
Parag and Uthappa?? Uhhh..,4
4D chess by steve smith to see if middle order can actually do anything,9
Didn't Pan Parag win RR match against MI last year?,9
That wasn‚Äôt even a good ball by Mavi should‚Äôve been put away,1
So many inside edges....,0
So tewatia has earned Lord status for that knock vs us. But what has Stuart binny done to get Lord status?,14
I think I‚Äôd rather have Buttler at 4-5 and play Jaiswal every game,1
Lethal Weapon Tewatia yet to come.,7
Buttler got out just so that RR's best player gets time to get set,6
I can definitely see Irfan Pathan as a carrier commentator,0
The pressure tewatiya must be going through now,3
Riyan (Gosling) Parag has a chance to become a star today.,3
All hope on lord Tewatia now. May his blessings do the trick on these poor RR souls and won the match for them.,2
Jesus people here are so reactionary it's ridiculous. Couple of bad innings and everyone seems to forget the player's whole career.,1
Damn that connection between Parag's father and Uthappa,2
Is KKR the new SRH?,4
Smith demoting Tewatia down the order to stir his ego.,2
Smith has right fucked this by chucking his wicket away after he'd almost been out two balls in a row...,2
They're too used to playing at Sharjah,2
All KKR needs to do is not let Jofra out to bat. Easy Game,3
"My brown friend says he should U-thappar himself.

What does that mean?",2
Entire RR team wants to play like tewatia now,3
Time for Quantum of Loss theory?,3
Agony for RR,1
Lol,1
Soft dick dismissal,1
That NRR is going to suck ass at the end of this game for RR.,6
uthappa is just stealing paychecks at this point?,5
This is a shitshow of a chase,7
"The sheer clownery, RR",5
61% of all runs scored by top 3 of RR's lineup was by Jos Butler.,2
Thank you sleeper agent Uthappa,7
Utthapa is just a walking wicket this IPL,9
"""I'll have a bowl first thenks""",8
Jeez Uthappa. Whats up with that?,3
"I feel sad for Uthappa , he's been so good for us and now this .",7
Utappa is so finished that you can play almost any uncapped player rather than him and you‚Äôll get the same contribution as him or better.,5
How RR is choking this one!,3
It feels like every innings Uthappa gets out the same way.,6
The stage is all set for lord tewatia...,8
Lmao typical uthappa,3
"I am forever thankful to RR for taking off trash Uthappa off of our hands.

Lmao, good luck with him.",7
That was a bit unlucky. Hit it sweetly,2
"RR has worst middle order. After first 3 wicket , only bowlers can bat .",5
Tewatia in the house!!!,1
Was that a career ending shot by Uthappa?,5
"Nagarkoti gets his first wicket

Ya Boi!!! 

A Lonely life in the fast lane",7
"This is the problem for RR. Right here. Thanks to them being so fucking top-heavy, and thanks to them missing Stokes, they need their Indian batsmen to outrageously over-perform every single game. Tewatia did that in Sharjah. Not sure if it's gonna happen every game.",2
Irfan Pathan in the dugout. I go mute.,2
F for Robin. Will miss you Robbie.,3
Lol Sharjah bullies,2
IPL scriptwriter stop with these weird scripts for games.,5
Smith triggered the collapse by playing that shot,2
The Tewatia duck is going to be a right shock,6
"Perfectly timed shot, straight into hands of fielder. That's Uthappa for you.",5
Jofra died for this,5
All set for Tewatia.,3
Uthappa was the imposter.,9
"Nobody downvote this, Let's See how many agree with me

*********************This Shit Is Fixed**********************",-1
Agent Uthappa finally coming good for KKR.,6
"Okay, we can call it a game boys. What a monumental pile of shit this chase has been.",1
Can we have all the matches at Sharjah,1
Uthappa needs to pull a Gambhir and just mentor the team!! Assistant to Warne,3
"KKRs investment in pacers paying off? Hope I don't jinx it God, I can't believe it. yeahhh!",8
"**7.1** Nagarkoti to Uthappa, OUT, **finds deep square with precision!** The man is in to save the second on a big boundary.This is a short ball, and Uthappa swipes right across his front leg, about chest height before it dips into that fielder's lap **41-4**

RV Uthappa c Shivam Mavi b Nagarkoti 2 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57",1
"As a KKR fan, I have major Uthappa PTSD.",5
Rajasthan's fault for not opening with Tewatia and Archer like they promised. Anger the meme gods at your peril Royals.,6
Oh lawd he‚Äôs coming,3
~~RCB~~ RR collapse üôÑ,2
Send Jofra in you cowards,3
"Considering Uthappa is terribly out of form, this RR batting lineup is weak af. Only 3 proper batsman. Butler, Smith and Samson.",3
 Robbie is deadweight,3
Uthappa is way past his prime.,3
Stage is set. RR's best batsman is in the house,3
aiyyo...,1
Awww can't perform outside Sharjah?,2
Lord to the rescue!,2
final season in IPL for uthappa. Here comes Lord Tewatia. Let him do the same thing as last match. Settle down and then go for runs.,3
Ben Stokes - I miss u.,7
RR management didn't fulfill their promise by not opening with Tewatia and Archer. Now KKR is helping them do it.,9
The pressure on Tewatia must be so much.. he gonna get written off if he doesn‚Äôt recreate that performance,2
Nagarkoti used to bowl 145-150 kmph during U19 WC. Hope that back injury hasn‚Äôt reduced his pace by a lot.,3
Lord!,1
"RR's indian home ground has big boundaries. Im shocked rather than being comfortable on this ground, they are throwing their wickets.",5
Lord is here!!!,3
They should have played Jaiswal..,2
From RCB collapse to RR collapse we grew up.,8
"Nagarkoti and Mavi taking wickets

You love to see it",4
Yass... Lord Tewatia,4
Uthappa's last IPL game of his career most probably,2
It has reduced quite considerably,1
How much did they pay for Uthappa?,2
We are becoming meme for today it seems,4
Can‚Äôt rmr last time Robbie played a match winning innings,3
RR is 41/4 just so Lord Tewatia can play to his full potential.,1
The Knight Rider in disguise,3
Uthappa has flopped ever since he changed his name to Robbie. Needs to consult with rising super giant astrologer.,8
The Great Lord has arrived !!!,1
"Tewatia to do a Tewatia. That is, be unpredictable and get out without eating any balls maybe?",4
another dope tewatia knock on the cards?,2
"I'm pissing in fear just by looking at this divine specimen. Too scared man, even though it's not my team.",1
Finally bowling like it used to be under Gautam Gambhir,10
"Can't blame Uthappa. That would have been a six in Sharjah... He didn't play the wrong shot, it's just the wrong venue.",4
This is the RR I remember from past years. Cries in marwadi,4
"Robin Uthappa, sadly his best cricketing days are behind him. 

So far behind him, he can no longer see them when he turns his head.",5
"Me, being the petty fuck that I am, will always be rooting for Tewatia to fail",3
"Thank you RCB for taking our shit pacers.

Thank you CSK for taking Piyush chawla.

Thank you RR for taking uthappa.",12
Wasn't RR supposed to be the better team here ?,3
Oh I forgot they have tom Curran and archer also.,2
Is Robbie actually playing any domestic cricket? Didn't he turn into commentator?,6
Really happy to see Nagarkoti play finally after 2 seasons of injury.,5
What the fuck's going on!,4
stepped away for a minute and they're 4 down. devolving rapidly.,6
[deleted],2
They're literally hitting everything onto fielders wtf ?,1
Can we just call this match off like I think we‚Äôre all done for today,2
"Lord's here. Alright guys, one by one, ask for your wishes",1
‡§ö‡•ãlapse this is !,2
please drop uthappa ffs.,4
C O L L A P S E,1
"*Doobie Doobie doo ba*

*Doooobie Doobie doo baa*

**Agent P**(arag)!",3
"This RR team got exposed. There is nothing after the top 3. (Tewatia aside)
Ben Stokes isn't the extra addition it is their necessity.",12
Daaaamn,1
Wtf is going on lol,3
Is this real life or is it a dream??,1
This is getting funny now,2
Gill absolute beauty diving forward,5
Are u fucking kidding me?,7
49 all out on the cards?,2
The fishes are out of the tank...,1
Gone,1
Nagarkoti using up all his good karma,1
PLEASE RR DONT GET PAST 49 I'M BEGGING,6
"Uthappa should hope that rumours about no mega auction are true cuz if there is, it‚Äôll be his last IPL",2
Nastiest collapse this season,6
Rcb's 49 in danger,5
Indian young guns are flying,1
That would have been six at Sharjah,4
Are we going to get another 49/10?,6
Hahahahahahahaha,1
Banter chase,1
Can't do a Tewatia if you get everyone else lol,4
"Falling like a pack of cards that Middle Order, need a strong team like MI to beat KKR.",2
One more wicket and I can go to bed early. Very sleep deprived this week.,3
Worst collapse in the history of worst collapses.,2
Utter shambles this,7
Please beat our 49 all out,5
Bruh that‚Äôs out can they stop dragging this,1
Middle order of RR can't even give a decent fight.,5
Poor batting,5
49/10 is on the cards bois,6
[deleted],2
"Jofra and tewatia now Bois , they did it intentionally",7
Tewatia gonna swing and miss till 17th over and then hit ten back to back sixes.,4
Come on that is out. Can we get over with it,2
Pathan chill. Let's listen to the 3rd umpire,6
"Gill, Mavi, Nagarkoti. - all kids being given chances and performing. Gotta love this KKR side.

Come on Varun, your turn now",6
RR getting cucked by the large ground. Ironic since they play at the SMS which is one of the larger grounds.,3
"I need a list of all the Lords lol 

So far I know tewatia and binny. Who else?",2
"This is a very, very bad chase so far. We need Stokesy",3
it carried. but really nice of shubhman to wait for umpire to call it. fair play points!,2
barring injury Mavi and Nagarkoti will be automatic selections for KKR going forward from now. Which makes them much more watchable.,2
"RR?

More like RRCB",4
"Pro cricket tip - when you hit it in the air, just don't hit it to a fielder",7
Anyone remember match losing *Dhonisque* inning from Uthappa? I'm sure that's the reason KKR released him.,6
Not even Tewatia can save them,1
"Kamlesh archer Nagarkoti 

Subhman jonty gill",5
Hell fucking yes.,1
"Shubman, Nagarkoti and Mavi... thats all",2
RR doing team version of Tewatia challenge,5
"On the bright side, no team looks absolutely, ridiculously strong, and bully their way to the playoffs. Every match's result is gonna be hard to predict.",1
RR getting exposed out of Sharjah. You love to see it,2
Rr weak middle order exposed the day smith and Samson fail,1
Come on 5 more before they score 49,4
"This is all a ruse to get KKR's hope up before Lord Tewatia begins...

Its cruel really on KKR",6
Cameraman getting confused between Nagarkoti  and Mavi.,2
"Nagarkoti, Gill and Mavi ..our old India U19 team driving us forward.",3
"Last game, RR created a record for the highest run chase. This game, we will create another record - Lowest total in IPL history.",1
"From ""Lmao this match is lost"" to ""We can improve on our NRR"" for KKR.",4
With this defeat for RR ( a Tewatia miracle notwithstanding) and the resulting NRR I believe we will be back at the top of the table..,4
"RCB's 49: ""My time has come""

/s",7
"Jofra is in good form with the bat, TBF.",3
Lol some one said the final will be between DDvs RR during the 1st innings.,1
RR please get 126+ for my Zomato credits.,5
Curran in at the 8th over lol,5
"srh vs rr
whose middle order is the worst?",4
Tewatia and Archer to get a 100 run partnership,5
"C   O   L   L   A   P   S   E

Sharjah bullies lol,7
"Lol cowards scared of tewatia, taking the batsmen on the other side...",8
Just setting the stage for Archer to strike at 400 again.,10
"Dhoni getting the last laugh at the Royals

If they played for NRR this wouldn't happen",8
Time for RR fans to return to Earth.,36
"Look as entertaining as it was to see Smith opening in the past 2 games, at the end of the day he's not an opener but a stabiliser and needs to bat at 3 or 4. Jaiswal should probably get called back into the team, the lad had one flop in the opening game and despite being an Indian batsman has been dropped already. Anyways, the game is completely gone now, the only way that Rajastan seem to win is the Smudged Samsung duo going huge every game with support from Buttler and co, as otherwise the batting is pretty unstable. This lineup is  screaming for Ben Stokes to return - solid in the middle order (even in his weakest format) and picks up wickets even if he goes for runs.",9
"**7.4** Nagarkoti to Parag, OUT, **taken low at backward point!** Very sharp from Gill, low to his left if he's taken this. **Soft signal is out.** Short ball outside off is laced off the back foot with an open face. It's quick and low to Gill's left. He keeps his eye on it, lunges low and in front. Appears like he has taken it cleanly too. Clean enough not to be overturned, anyway. That will stay out **42-5**

R Parag c Shubman Gill b Nagarkoti 1 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66",3
RR wanted to open their batting with archer and tewatia. This is only a part of their plan.,6
[deleted],11
KKR's bowling department is massive STONKS.,11
this is embarrassing... we out here,6
"Other teams to RR after they struggle in first match outside Sharjah: Aur bhaiii, aa gaya swaad?",13
"I always wondered why the commentators were critical of SRH having a weak middle order, but jerked off RR as some sort of a formidable lineup. 

RR's middle-order is right up there with SRH as the worst middle order in the entire league.",7
I just like how KKR held back these young bowlers and trusted in them keeping on line their IPL Cup aspirations for two years.,14
Sharjah Royals,5
Nagarkoti bowling 140+. Let's go baby!,2
"After watching Nagarkoti and Mavi, i want Porel to play tomorrow.",2
Turntables Turntables Turntables,3
Get that chunky fucker Warney out the set-up. We were doing well until he came in with his top tips,5
I‚Äôm going to get off and start studying soon,2
Someone remind curran that he is not playing for Morgan...,3
"Riyan Parag-

6(4) when RR made 216

0(2) when RR made 226

Now 1(6)

Has bowled 1 over in the tournament so far. Went for 14-0",2
This is officially the worst game of the season so far.,1
"Nagarkoti and Mavi with 2 each

You really love to see it",2
RR supporters waiting for Tewatia to pull off a Tewatia!,3
"Last 2 deliveries >143 kmph!!

Nagarkoti is getting into the groove.",3
"If rajasthan happens to win from here , that makes 2 incredible come from behind victories back to back..
Doesn't happen often though ..",9
"Gill, Nagarkoti, Riyan all involved in that dismissal played in the same Under-19 side right ?",6
RR should have actually opened with Tewatia and Archer lol.,10
"Inb4 Tom Curran scores a NICE 69 and partners with Jofra ""400 SR so far this IPL"" Archer to shithouse RR to victory",6
I think it's too early but Nagarkoti is the best bowler in the world,7
I miss Ben Stokes,7
Guys calm down as long as the lord is out there we are safe,4
Did the commentator used the n-word for *negarkoti*?,1
Idk why it‚Äôs satisfying to watch RR collapse,5
"Ppl trolling Morgan

Now u know how valuable that inning was

Difference betn 150 n 175",10
Bring back Cummins and finish this off,3
"Calling it early

No Tewatia special today",12
I honestly don't understand why Parag has been so hyped up. His one fifty last year was the only notable innings. Really think Yashaswi deserves a spot instead.,3
I'd really love to see what Nagarkoti can do with a ball and conditions that provide some sideways movement,1
Specialist fielder Kuldeep does something,2
"Kuldeep is playing, didn't even remember that..",2
Tewatia should continue his innings from 8(19) to avoid the follow on,4
That fickle middle order problem is bugging all teams this season.,1
Is now a good time to stop watching,1
Switched off tv. Hope I don't miss anything.,2
Forgot Kuldeep Yadav exists in this team,5
"Hi Guys, any idea why Pakistan are wearing Pink ? thanks",7
"Just need to sort out the batting i reckon. With this kind of a bowling attack, we might defend anything.",2
"RR why tear, when Lord is here

RR no worries, when Lord is at the crease",3
Why is curran not giving strike to the lord,2
Why is people talking about collapse now? Best batsman Tom Curran is in the crease and Archer yet to come.,8
This is good bowling but even worse batting if that makes sense,1
"Nagarkoti is actually fantastic. Saw him what feels like years ago in the U19 WC, so happy to see that he's come up from his injuries sharp as ever.",1
"Ahhh so today‚Äôs the day Jof scores a 20 ball century.

I knew the day would come, never thought it would be so soon...",7
jaiswal twirling his hair like komolika from the dugout lmaooo,5
"Bring in Kuldeep now

Gotta boost his confidence",5
Imagine what the legend of Tewatia becomes if he leads them to victory from here.,1
"Oh phew, the Altroz is here guys, calm down",7
Boy these foreign commentators have a hard on for Curran bros !,3
Does anyone thinks RR are playing as if this match is fixed?,1
"Nagarkoti can slog, bowl 140+ and field like a rockstar. Dubey who? 3D VJ who?",9
I heard Swann‚Äôs ‚ÄúAYYYY‚Äù and thought that was a wicket but it was just the altroz... jfc,7
"What does this.riyan Parag do, literally making up the playing 11",4
It feels like they are making fun of the Altroz at this point,9
Swann ejaculating seeing Altroz,4
"Tom ""averages 41 with the bat in ODIs"" Curran to save this",4
"Lol, Swanny on fire today",3
Swann must be jerking off imagining that car.,8
"Mavi Nagarkoti Gill Bishnoi Jaiswal, man I'm excited",1
RR competing with SRH on giving a boring game,1
Only Lord Tewatia can save RR now,2
"This is not a knee jerk reaction, and I have never doubted that RR are the weakest team on paper in this IPL.",6
Its great to see Nagarkoti and Mavi bowl in tandem at last.,1
"I know its early, but I've got a funny feeling this one might not go to a super over",3
New game- someone slaps Swanny every time Altroz comes on screen.,3
Really hope that Nagarkoti and Mavi are learning a thing or two from Cummins. You don't get a chance to train alongiside one of the best in the world that frequently.,12
Can‚Äôt believe anyone could think this game is over when Lord Tewatia and a guy with a ODI batting average of over 40 are at the crease,8
"https://twitter.com/PMKumar_Nellai/status/1310432438758277120?s=19

Lmao wtf ??!!!

The victim complex is real here",11
"Can any of you believe the conversation that's happening on dugout, Jesus.",4
Yeah don't think Tewatia will be able to pull RR out of this hole today.,9

I forgot about Kuldeep,2
If RR lose this game then they would have lost to a team that lost to a team that got beaten by RCB. Imagine that.,5
"No one:

SRK in Dubai: K....K.... k..... Curran!",26
That Altroz had better bloody have ceat tires on,13
Moral victory- lowest IPL total still belongs to RCB (49 all out),17
"Lol it's not good bowling from KKR but rather bad batting from RR 

Their first match with MI showed how good their bowling is",-13
How many Tewatia's six would have been out on this ground?,1
Riyan Parag the biggest deadbeat in this tournament so far,3
"RCB to collapse : na seekha jeena jeena kaise jeena, na seekha jeena tere bina humdum.",6
Thank you IPL for showing tewatia banging kxip. A much needed watch.,3
There are two impostors in the 8 ipl teams.,8
"Doubt Tewatia will be able to pull it off today.Bigger ground, better bowling.",8
I‚Äôm off.,4
"Brain Lara saying ""you can pretty much say the game is over"" on air.
Damn.",14
So what do you do? Go down swinging and risk being bowled out for 80 or play smart and get to 120?,5
Only RCB can end the RCB 49 meme,4

"Interesting story about Tewatia's batting.

Early on his career, he was solely focusing on his bowling. But because the team already had well established finger spinners at the time (Ashwin and Jadeja) his coach advised him to work on his batting and provide more of a value proposition.

Cut to 8 years later, we see him go absolutely mental, scoring 30 off an over.",7

why isnt kuldeep bowling?,2

I caught him smelling the pink ...... mask.,3
First time RR missed Stokes this season.,7
Can anybody explain why Gopal was sent above Archer?,4
This is the difference of having and not having a seasoned middle order batsman like Eoin Morgan in your lineup,11
"For what it's worth, a loss, no matter how big it may be, is still just a singular loss. Maybe now the management realises that uthappa needs to be dropped for Vohra. Maybe bench parag for Yashasvi and get Smith back at no. 3.",3

"Bit confused why you wouldn‚Äôt send Archer out, I can only assume it‚Äôs Archers decision and he‚Äôs backing himself to knock off whatever‚Äôs left no matter how little balls there is.",4

This is like the old KKR  back when Eden was a slow spinners surface,2
"Obviously it isn't as sudden as Tewatia's, but Chakravarty's redemption arc is quite remarkable too.",6
KKR need to play one more batsman,3
wow this hurts.. anyway good preparation for the next time RR choke like this again,2
Varun C looks really good. KKR has struck gold with all these youngsters. I dont know how they can retain everyone. They will lose some of the talent to other teams.,10

Ultra edge?,1
feels cathartic to be a clown for a day ngl,4

No kuldeep overs today is quite shocking,4

This is why you should bat without gloves. Much safer,11
"Would be really surprised if KKR young duo of pacers Mavi and Nagarkoti doesn't go for 8-0-119-0 couple of times this season. Mind you even Bumrah, Shami, Bhuvi sometimes go over 10 RPO",-7

Dumbasses just go straight to ultraedge,5

"All out before 15th over, what do we reckon",1

This is a classic reversal of fortune for RR compared to their last match,2
This will probably not bode well for Kuldeep's confidence,5

RR have a real chance of not even making it to 100 runs...,2
"**13.5** Narine to Gopal, OUT, **appeal for catch behind is turned down and DK reviews.** Was looking for the reverse whip against a middle stump ball. Looks like it took his glove, went onto pad and then lobbed up for the keeper who took it high to his right. Replays are more or less confirming that right now. That will be overturned **81-7**

Isnt it just a uae ground thing at this point?Every team has to have an embarrassing loss.,3
Kuldeep will get consolation overs to tailenders,6
UNLEASH THE JOF,3
What's up with Archer's right cheek?,2
Jofra to end the game in 3 overs,6
I mean from what I have seen Dhoni is especially terrible with DRS calls,3
At least promote Kuldeep and let him pinch hit if you don't want him to bowl. Batting him at 11 and not bowling him is humiliating,9
how much do rr need to lose by to go below rcb?,8
Want rr to qualify at four and win the whole thing,1

I said nothing.,3
Wow. What a catch!,4

Spectacular catch. KKR got great youngsters.,5
"Sometimes grounds are bigger, man",2
What will they talk about in the timeout lmao!,4
That's a karbon kamaal catch,9
These two just need to block out 5 overs to escape with a draw,8
With all this talent I think we(India) need almost a separate team for each format just like England.,8
"We win this and we move from 7th to 3rd, and yes csk is still at 8th..",11
Lol RR back to being RR.,9
Virat with lowest and archer with highest strike rate this ipl,34
Where's the other Rajasthan royals dude who looks like unadkat,0
I ain't even sure if RR will even be able to bat 20 overs,2
RR have one brainfade match every season where they get out below 100,3
KKR stuck with Nagarkoti for 2 years when he was injured. Kudos to them for sticking out. Poor guy couldn't even play domestic tournaments during that time.,11
I am having hard time believing Russell and Kuldeep have yet to bowl a ball.,9
What do RR have to stratergize about? How to mask up Unadkat as Butler?,4
Boys Tom Curran is gonna top score for the royals! Whats this timeline!,13
now you can see why KKR were hyping Nagarkoti as a gun fielder aka jadeja. That adds a dimension for sure.  Can they trade Kuldeep for a batsman. They need another batter. They can even add Prasidh or Sandeep to get another batsman. I hope they allow in season trades.,6
Did the fielder just headbutt the ball after taking that catch?,2
RR in Strategic time out: *100 run to banao lavdo*,11
Why is Kuldeep in the side if he is not gonna bowl?,2
[deleted],6
RR should play for run rate now. Finish the overs.,5
"https://twitter.com/CricCrazyJohns/status/1297792724054106112

> Venky Mysore (in RK Show) said ""Once Rahul Dravid told me - Kamlesh Nagarkoti is one of the best fielders going in India - he will compete with Ravi Jadeja in future"".",22
Rr out here getting destroyed,7
I see they have got a new mystery spinner,7
Did DK forgot Kuldeep?,4
People talking about trading players. Is that even allowed in this IPL?,1
We've got this without a single over from Kuldeep,8
Yay kulya,2
"Assuming RR lose this game, these are the toss stats in the 12 games so far

Win the toss, bat first - Only one game, SRH (lost) vs KKR 

Win the toss, field first - 11 games. Only CSK won vs MI and RR won vs KXIP. Other 9 games lost (including 2 super overs)

JUST WIN THE TOSS AND BAT FIRST!!",8
Fun fact Mavi and Nagarkoti are not that short in heights. Even Shami and Bhuvi are of average height for fast bowlers. 3-4 seasons without injury will do wonders for these kids.,12
thank god kuldeep is back.,3
"The Sunfeast bacche ko bachao ad is so bad that it makes me talk about it and therefore, serves its purpose",12
DK really forgot kulya huh?,5
Kuldeep was playing. I forgot,8
Let Nagarkoti bowl next over if there is a next over please.,1
The Currans have built themselves a long legacy of saving their teams from complete embarrassment after all the batsmen have shat the bed,14
Kuldeep coming good would be pretty amazing. We could drop Naraine and play Banton.,9
"""We're gonna have a bowl thanks""",12
"2 out of 12 matches have been won by the team who won the toss. 

So much for toss = 50% of the match",6
Kuldeep must have gone to DK to make him realise he's in XI,9
This is some gully cricket bowling line up Kuldeep could do better on the bench .,4
"5 overs left Curran, you've got to start twatting it. No point churning through singles now",6
When you have so many bowling options that your premiere spinner comes to bowl with opposition being 8 down.,5
"I hate NRR, just ruins games like this

Can't arsed to watch them try and get as close as possible - they should be forced to try and cunt it till they get out",5
"Kuldeep to DK : ""Am i a joke to you?""",12
"Hol up

RCB have defended the lowest total this year, vs SRH",5
Why is Kuldeep bowling so late?,5
RR demise in this innings started with  Smith. If only he had shown a little more responsibility.,8
"Wait, how the hell is Kuldeep bowling his first over just now???",8
No team remains unbeaten after this match,6
"Just when I thought that the whole team has bowled besides DK, Kuldeep comes in.",12
"Damn forget about us people who're watching, looks like DK also didn't remember that Kuldeep is playing.",15
Nothing would make me happier if RR were to be bowled out,9
"KKRs next match is against Delhi. 




Ricky vs McCullum ü§ë",10
Find it a bit insulting the way DK treats kulya,12
I think they could‚Äôve squeezed 3 in there but whatever,6
KKR not playing Kuldeep regularly is criminal. The guy is in the national team for god‚Äôs sake and an experienced spinner in all formats of the game. He deserves better than KKR.,8
I'm bored. I'm going to sleep,2
This is great captaincy from DK. He used his bowlers well. Utilising pace bowlers till tenth over to rattle the batsmen who were finding it difficult to adjust to this pitch.,4
RR became RCB,10
"Well, at least they reached 3 figures",4
"CSK > MI > KKR > RR > KXIP > RCB > SRH > DC > CSK

This IPL is gonna be good!!",79
"Where the sixes now, Jhopda Archer!",4
"Yeah RR should first get to 100+ and save themselves the humiliation. Tom Curran is the highest run scorer lmao

Otherwise, it has been a perfect display of cricket from KKR on what doesn't look to be a 200+ pitch. Excellent stabilising from Gill and Rana at the top of the order followed by some good finishing from Morgan and Russel. And their bowling has been nothing short of top class, with both excellent economy and wicket taking. Not to mention the fielding - the catches have been senational and they've barely given away unnecessary extra runs in the field. Honestly aside from DK failing with the bat (and even then he had a good day with the gloves) this is the performance of a team who is hungry to win, and I like that. If RR don't make the playoffs I'd like to see KKR have a shot at winning, they have all the tools to do so: gun youths combined with experienced campaigners, a balanced batting lineup with both stabilisers and finishers. a bowling attack with a variety of options which can be tailored to the conditions, both probing pace bowlers and solid spinners. Heck, they have it all.",9
Next match against RCB... who will be the bigger meme,7
Tom Curran doesn't get out at all. He can be sent in to prevent collapse in ODIs,9
"Why do the sides batting first keep winning, even if the conditions favor batting second?",5
What‚Äôs with the comments on Kuldeep and him needing time to regain ‚Äòconfidence‚Äô ??? he has been useless for a long period  . Time to try out some one new for the Indian team,4
"Really glad to see Chakravarti perform well. Still remember ABDv smashing him around a couple years ago, didn't get another game that season. Has been really good this year.",2
Can RR still win ? Lol,3
Almost got out,1
"Ah yes, sucking up to Dhoni. A constant among IPL commentators",23
Unadkat seems to be a better batsman than a bowler,11
"Collect and throw quickly, fine fielding by Koti",7
How the tables turned.,2
One sided games are poor viewing. First time I've seen the hotstar viewer count dip below 30L.,1
Imagine if RR wins this,-2
Our Ranji winning captain is a boring batsman üòû,4
"Tomorrow's gonna be interesting, KXIP never disappoints",12
Is there a limit on the NRR a team can gain in a single match?,4
Start smacking ffs,2
Rajasthan Bangalore royals,3
Tom Curran is the white MS Dhoni,7
Is that like Warnie's son sitting next to him?,6
We deserve these duds after couple of breathtaking games.,7
Has anyone ever bowled 71 no balls in a row? Asking for a friend,10
I think this is the first time I have seen Kuldeep bowling in half sleeve,4
71 off 17 nah I don't think that RR will win this game,3
"If Kuldeep still can't pick these batsmen, I think his end is near, his form has been non existent since last year..",8
Kuldeep smiled. Awwwwüò≠,6
Why is warnie not in the RR dugout?,1
Patty just smiled and impregnated all our girlfriends,9
"Lets forget all our differences and agree to this fact:

""Kent deta hai sabse shuddh pani""",7
"If everyone in the stadium isolated upon arrival and are in a bubble, then why are they wearing masks, that too whilst they're watching the game from the stands? Makes little sense.",4
Match is so boring they are showing highlights of RCB vs MI. Lol,7
"If KKR can't utilize Kuldeep, then he is tailor-made for CSK",4
Star feeling sorry for us having to watch this bore and showing eye candy Cummins intermittently,8
Are we seeing Kuldeep on decline? Has been a year since he bowled well. I think he needs to work more towards the longer format considering the pace he bowls at. He can't be a primary spinner in T20.,5
LMAO SOMEONE JUST WHEEZED OUT LOUD IN THE DUGOUT,2
Rest in peace.. 106 -9,2
Nagarkoti: gonna catch 'em all,7
I was sure that went for six!!,3
Lord Unadkat shocked at the distance,5
Archer should bat like Afridi even in Test cricket.,5
"Unadkunt is surprised, I wonder why",5
Nagarkoti seems to be circling the ground..he's everywhere,4
NRR stonks,7
Nooo wanted a below 100 all out,3
All teams look good this year except CSK. Hope it changes when rayudu comes back.,2
That would have been a six in Sharjah,9
Unadkat looks so much like Rahane,13
What happened?,2
Unadkat chalta phirta laxmi chit fund,8
"**17.6** Kuldeep Yadav to Unadkat, OUT,  **106-9**

JD Unadkat c Nagarkoti b Kuldeep Yadav 9 (13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 69.23",2
The fuck . Nagarkoti is omnipresent.,3
Yesss....bowl the bastards out,2
Kuldeep got his 1st wicket of the tournament I think,3
MY BOI KULDEEP GETS HIS WICKET,3
I was so scared for Kuldeep if it would have been six,2
">RR need 69 runs in 12 balls

Mushkil toh nhi keh sakte, tough jaroor hoga",12
Nvm should have been a six here too,5
Just take the L unadcunt,6
KKR = BOWLDEEP,5
Cablegate,9
Bruh it hit the strings,5
Unadkat is poor man's Rahane,8
"Peak gully cricket stuff this. ""Camera par lagi hai nahi hai out""",10
Tom Curran has scored more runs than Kohli in this innings alone,22
The game‚Äôs been done and dusted for a while now,8
This loss  will sting but CSK and KXIP fans rubbing it in will hurt more,13
I think it hit it,8
Lol unadkat,3
End the misery and give out,2
"Well, atleast crossed 100, hope boys learn something from this new ground and loss.",15
"I swear bruh, if captains choose to chase again",28
Why? Play for run rate you idiots.,12
ArjUnadkat,8
Unadkat has an extremely punchable face. Even more so than that Whitehat Jr. kid.,22
Kuldeep ROBBED. Fuck spidercam.,11
No IPL match is without uniqueness of its own. Now we have spy cam wire doing bullshit,17
"Unadkat , Uthappa and Riyan are useless. RR with them or without them have same value.

Stokes will give stability to batting and much needed strength in bowling but RR still need someone at 4.  

Smith needs to be consistent if they wants to qualify.",12
What are the commentators seeing?,3
How the hell you are supposed to see that. Lol ..  We need drones in sky from now.,12
"Lol, we would need ultra edge for these things too. Cricket never ceases to amaze.",16
Ootl- what‚Äôs happening?,1
Is this conclusive enough,3
This could only happen in 2020 lol,9
[removed],2
Unad is like dammit i was this close to win this match for my team if it wasn't for that wire.,30
Kuldeep: Fuck me,8
Just go man,2
Wrong call imo,5
3rd umpire is a Kuldeep fan.,7
we need balltracker for the cam wires now?,5
Yess happy for Kuldeep,3
Peak cricket nonsense that,7
Yessss.....bowl em out please,0
that would have been a six,3
"Not Unadkat's day, just like everyday",22
A cable? Seriously! This IPL has everything.,4
Tom Curran watching this chutiyapa from the other end lmao,5
Unadkat is a meme ü§£,3
Bruh how,4
Probably touched the wire but there was no way of knowing for sure.,10
I think the 3rd umpire went fuck it and gave it out. Who cares at this point really?,25
that is dead ball lol wtf umpiring,8
"Unadkat : "" Bitch i was gonna win this you know üòû""",14
The fuck were the umpires checking lmao,5
KKR has completely dominated us in the last couple of seasons.,3
"You were not going to score 70 in 2 overs Unadkat.

Why were you fighting dude.",6
they need to use ultraedge for that,5
Lmao are punchable faces universal? Unadkat and that smug kid in that e learning ad,6
Go for 50 TOM!,3
Gritty 50 in a losing cause incoming from Curran,5
Altoz almost lost the headlight,6
Fuck your Altros,9
"Dented the Gold Standard, eh?",5
Awwwwww PLS BREAK THE ALTROZZ,6
Maybe in future we can put sensors on the cables of Spidey cam.,4
Pacers could roll guys like Unadkat and Rajpoot over but KKR is persisting with spin for some reason.,2
Lmao Curran playing for his 50 so he can have one up on his bro Sam. üòÇ,13
Swann almost fainted,3
When we review tonights performance I think we can all agree Spidercam robbing us of unadcunts match winning innings is a great injustice that has cost us the game,13
"Yes tom, hit that fucking car again",11
~~game~~ ball going UP to the wire!,2
why are you hitting sixes now? tom curran,1
"It's so good to see kkr win this, taking down a team which did not sweat chasing 200+",1
I thought they gonna run that spidercam/ball footage entire night.,4
Please tell me it hit that damn car,6
Lol are kkr feeling generous now? Use Cummins and Nag you smoothbrains,12
They spent so much time on this Spyder cam decision as if Jaydev Unadkat was critical to RR's chances of making 69 of 2 overs...,9
Time to bring in wierd fields and get the wicket,5
Nagarkoti : I'm inevitable,10
"Glad rajasthan is losing, this is what they get for breaking their promise to not open with Jofra üôÑ
for some retweets",7
[removed],3
Big dick Curran,3
Tom Curran scored more runs than Kohli in this IPL.,14
Sometimes you can see a face and tell whether that person has had luck favoring him somewhat. Unadkat feels like he's always unhappy lol so don't get that vibes off him.,6
Curran for 50!,3
Tom curran is angry,6
Bloody hell Curran,3
"The umpire for a moment thought it might have hit the camera wire, but then realised it was Unadkat complaining, so decided fuck it",10
"Narine Out, Banton in 

because a batsman is needed and don't want to drop either of Mavi, Nagarkoti, Kuldeep, Varun",6
He doesn't average 41 in ODIs for nothing,8

Unadkat looked very convinced it had hit the cable,3

Tom curran pulling off dhoni here to save nrr,8
KKR is being extravagant now. Play for NRR ffs,10
Not as embarrassing tbf,2
Curran 4 short from being highest scorer in the match,3
Made his half century,1
Most useless player of the IPL till now is definitely Robbie Uthappa . Looks hassled  and stressed out while batting and fielding both .,3
Bit late to the party tom,3
Looks like DC fans will have a wank fest tonight,1
"At this point, I really hope that the ball hits the car and a cybertruck happens",2
Unadkat is my village cricketer bitching about the ball hit the cable,11

get jaiswal to open with butler. then samson. smith at 4. they are too top heavy rn.,8
Literally every England player besides Mark Wood is an all-rounder,13
Ankit is a very harmless name,2
RR THALA ACADEMY,7
Rajpoot hitting Kuldeep? Seriously?,9
Poor poor Kuldeep. Getting hit by 11th,12
Lol this is bad captaincy. Where my 140+ quicks at?,3
Why not bowl Cummins in the last 2 overs ffs,6
This is quality NRR management,13
TC top scorer of the night h8rs to the left üòéüòé,13
Reminder : RR are playing Uthappa instead of giving Yashasvi Jaiswal more chances,23
Karthik wants to revive and destroy Kuldeep.,9
KKKR everybody can bowl. RR everybody can bat.,28
Even Rajput is hitting kulya now. Fuck,13
[removed],10
I want Ben Curran to join the IPL,15
Rip to the guy that said the match was gonna end without anyone getting 50,12
Man the way Curran batted and the few shots of tewatia and jofra show that rr could have won if even one of the top order batsman had hung on,16
Both the Currans playing like the other team,4
"Fuck this, I wanted an all out not getting hitted for sixes.",5
KKR management didn't pay 15Cr to Cum for this. üò°,3
C'mon Tom hit a six to Kuldeep and make him cry,11
"Lmao they gave Kuldeep the ball after RR lost 8 wickets and after having his arse saved by the spider cam rope, he's now being twatted around by the NO.11 batsman. Someone's getting dropped real soon.",9
RR badly missing Stokes.,9
"RRR of 252

Might be a tough chase",11
Rr saved their NRR,10
Anyone watching der klassiker after this?,4
Imagine if it was Dhoni in place of Curran. r/cricket would go bonkers.,10
If smith and a few others hadnt fucked this it would have been relatively comfortable...,9
maaan kuldeep getting murdered by tailenders.,7
We need kkr to win over over rcb to complete a full circle,6
Damn never realised how dangerous the KKR bowling lineup is,12
Kuldeep bowling to impress Warnie?,5
"RR utterly shit the bed with that batting performance, but fair play to KKR. Very much a day for the bowlers",6
Not bowled out üí™,6
Still not a bad finish after being 66-6. At least came near and helped their NRR somewhat.,11
Two more overs RR could have won :),7
"MI get free points from KKR. KKR get free points from RR. RR get free 
points from MI.",17
Both Tom and Sam Curran have IPL fifties now,36
Kuldeep tapped Dk's ass,11
Someone needs to work with Kuldeep. He looks clueless.,8
I have a feeling RR is gonna go to the qualifiers based on their games in sharjah. They are playing a lot there.,10
No matter what anyone says. I hate Karthik as a captain. He is just shit,14
Piss poor captaincy. Get the quicks to knockover the tailender. Instead DK giving them six hitting practice.,7
Why didn't Curran try to hit big shots earlier?,-3
Why does Kuldeep look so deflated in his body language? Nursing an injury or something?,16
"Friendship ended with RR, now KKR is my new 2nd best friend",22
KKR should've played their best bowlers and get that NRR boost.,15
37 run win doesnt do justice to the absolute shitshow of an innings we just endured,43
From #7 in the tables to #2.,28
"If you don't think this match was fixed, I admire your ability to lie to yourself",-22
This season is very unpredictable,14
"That's what you get for breaking your promise, RR admin",12
Pretty good recovery considering being like 66-6.,14
And now all teams have been beaten at least once,9
"Rajasthan Royals, more like Sharjah Royals amirite?!",20
"Huh, these Curran brothers are something",15
Man RR is miasing a batsman of Rahane's caliber,0
KKR can probably go for the record of bowling all 11 players in their side at this rate,10
Now time to search through Archer's tweets to find the one that perfectly predicted this result,19
Ah we were so close /s,6
"Karthik as a captain is confused and haven't seen him do well. Needs to give captaincy to Morgan. There was absolutely no logic to bowl Naraine/Kuldeep when nagarkotti, cummins and russel had overs left. Naraine is playing pretty much on name rather than performance. Could be easily dropped for Banton as his bowling is ineffective now.",8
"CSK bought the wrong Curran, Tom saved the NRR today...",28
"This chase depended on Smith getting it right on this big ground. Instead he played a weird ""innings"" trying to smack Cummins",13
"All teams have played 3 games. 4 teams have 4 points, 4 teams have 2 points. What an evenly divided table!",11
No post match thread?,1
really good bowling lineup for kkr. very interested in seeing how they fare against some better batting attacks.,5
I have a feeling I‚Äôm gonna have to change my flair to DC at some point cause I don‚Äôt see RR going far (beyond Sharjah that is),10
"Smith - Things didn't go as plan

Someone show him a video of him flashing his bat at everything like a tailender",35
"I might be wrong, but I think Kuldeep used to bowl a line a bit outside the off, when he was more effective. That invited batsman to drive him, play him in the off side, play the cut shot against the spin.

Now he is bowling too straight, making it easier for right handers to hit him with the turn in the leg side.",12
"Lesson of the day:

If you win the toss, bat first.

If you lose, pray that the other team bowls first.",27
"Where tf is the post Match thread, I got some spicy comments typed up already",12
Nagarkoti and Mavi for the win!,13
why can't they ask nagarkoti questions in hindi?,20
"Nagarkoti struggling with the interview , just let him speak in Hindi",22
wtf we went down a place without playing. unfair,20
"These new age cricketers are younger than me and they look and play like beasts on field. 

Then they come to post match presentations and look so.... Young and vulnerable",22
Sunil Gavaskar is in the comm box. He should have been the one talking to Nagarkoti!,4
I don't like how these guys judge players based on their interview skills. Like who gives a fuck? It's not their job lmao,22
This nagarkotti is a nice lad.,12
[deleted],-1
Jos bats well lower down the order for England right? Can he go to #4 and play jaiswal? So RR can have 4 batsmen instead of 3? Drop uthappa,10
"ffs after a performance like that, nagarkoti deserves to express himself in a language he feels comfortable with. epic fail from star for not giving him that platform.",16
"RR: Win the toss, choose to bowl, and then lose the game because the dew didn't make a difference to ease batting as earlier predicted  
  
Every other IPL team: *First time?*",13
Reminder that RR pulled off the most braindead batting performance of the season and yet scored 7 more runs than CSK did versus DC chasing the same total.,31
"So RCB is in top 4.

How do fans feel about that?",9
Nagarkoti man of the match,11
This IPL is ridiculously closely matched. No team is going far ahead or falling far behind,13
No post match thread?,12
India u-19 wc 2018 boys are doing decently this IPL,19
this is what happens when no dave miller,5
Nice Jesus cosplay by SRK,24
"I don't understand the comments saying ""KKR is not performing well, but winning"" or ""KKR does not deserve to win 2 out of the 3 matches"".

What do you mean? KKR won the 2 matches comfortably. None of them were close. No super over BS.

Just because they were not a run fest, it was not a good ""performance""? Or what?

Serious question!",49
So Smith's weakness was Cummins all this while?,40
This is the first IPL where you genuinely can't predict the top four,28
From 66-6 to losing by 37 runs..I'll take this loss! Next up vs RCB!! Game on.,24
"Maybe, just maybe Nagarkoti was not at all inconvenienced. Don't fucking try to outrage for tiniest things.",3
Tf? The Gamechanger didn't change the game for his team,14
The game changer didn't change the game.,6
"Man.. Gotta love ipl for these amazing match ups.
Bumrah - Kohli

Cummins - Smith

Archer - Morgan

To name a few",22
A Tamilian serving as a Hindi translator? Now that's a first xD (Tamilian here).,34
Hinthi imposition on DK,28
Dinesh Karthik is the least confident captain out there...look at his body language,-31
"Considering two useless players in Robin and Parag, RR did well to win the first 2 matches with 9 players.",14
That was a wholesome interview,11
"Finally, two MoM awards to bowlers in two days. Mfs be writing 'smash the batriarchy' on instagram and then saying these 200 run chases are the best day of my life",47
That was insensible batting performance from RR.Alas they could have done better.,8
Don‚Äôt want to be at the mercy of other teams to top the table. But i will take it.,18
"why does Steve Smith, modern day Bradman, holder of 62+ test average, bat like a tailender in a regulation run chase?",39
"Wtf is the England team?

Archer and Curran can also hit. Too much bat deep!",25
"Tom Curran batted beautifully,that was the way to proceed chase for RR.Or they could have taken inspiration from Morgan how to bat on such pitches.",20
Glad to see Tom do well,16
This edition of ipl is really unpredictable,5
"I don't know why smith had such haste knowing there are no proper batsman in the team and samson also throwing his wicket and buttler got an edge and the middle order got destroyed in the over of nagarkoti and unadkat could have given the strike to Curran playing 13  balls and why was archer bought in so late?Curran played beautifully but I think others could have supported him ,even archer got down in 3 balls,atleast we didn't play bad after a terrific batting collapse and lost by 37 runs,it is going to affect the nr,the law of averages caught with us just like Delhi who lost to Hyderabad in the last match.",4
