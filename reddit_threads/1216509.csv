Chokers vs old engines. Who will win?,1
Hii,1
Did I come early,1
"Alright folks, we have to win some game, right?

This is it!",7
Kings vs kings,3
Jadhav plis,7
"poor team selections, whoever gets it right today will win",8
"If jadhav starts , I ain't watching. Dhoni's team selection is wank and he never gives youngsters their chance at all.",1
I feel like Kings 11 have a chance today. CSK should open with Curran and Faf and replace Watson with Hazlewood.,1
Nair 2(5) incoming continued with not being dropped,2
We are not going to drop Watson. Jadhav I am not so sure.,5
"Why have chennai not announced replacements for Raina and Bhajji. They could get 2 gun players who are in form but they haven‚Äôt done it for some strange reason. Because of this, out of form players in the playing XI can‚Äôt be dropped cuz the bench is even worse",21
[deleted],22
Mandeep Harpreet Jordan in üôè,3
"CSK need to junk Watson and Jadhav and bring in Tahir desperately. Dhoni also needs to make sure he‚Äôs not eating up balls like he has and that the likes of Curran and Bravo arent sitting around with their cocks in their hand while Jadhav and himself punt it around for dots and singles. Keeping this in mind, feel like this is what CSKs lineup should be: 

Rayudu 

Gaekwad

Faf 

Dhoni (Floater: only comes in if first 2 fall early) 

Curran 

Jadeja 

Bravo 

Thakur 

Chahar 

Tahir 

Karn/Chawla 


Plethora of batting and bowling. Santner/Hazlewood can come in for Tahir/Bravo as needed.",3
Ofcourse CSK is unchanged,11
What the fuck is keeping jadhav and watson still in the team and tahir/santner on the bench?,9
Csk fan here but sincerely hope they finish last so the management can wake up their fucking idea,10
[My body is ready](https://gfycat.com/commonbluedipper),2
Fantasy picks?,1
Heck i feel kohli doing a better job picking his team than dhoni,33
Gowtham should not have been dropped,12
Gowtham deserved more chance. That last over was not his fault. And he batted well too,4
So CSK to chase again? 1/4 so far.,6
"No changes CSK? Unfortunately I believe this is going to be a cakewalk for Kings XI batting first. Set an high total with inform batsmen like KL and Mayank, Defend with bowlers like Cottrell and Shami. I don't think CSK will show too much competition today unless someone scores massively big in the top order which looking at the past games is unlikely",7
"Our management fucking sucks. Why the fuck are they persisting with Watson and Jadhav while there are people like Tahir, Santner, Ruturaj Gaikwad etc on the squad?

Drop Jadhav and bring in Ruturaj man. Give chance to youngsters.",30
"CSK to win this.

You heard it here first. This is before even the match has started


Edit: Downvoter, fuck you, behnchod",7
Playing bravo at 8. Well done csküòë. we need a different script ffs!,7
Chennai aren't losing 4 in a row lmao. We are losing today,11
alright chris jordan! it was his birthday yesterday iirc,1
Maxwell the clown will try to hit 360 degree shots and fail again. Just fuck off with the team selection.,5
Dhoni is losing tosses right when we need him to win them :(,4
I just don't understand why Jadhav is in the team,9
Dhoni has getting thicc,0
Upvote if you think Thala and his army will whistle-podu tonight üòÇ,-4
A chase again? I already feel bad for dhoni lol.,5
[deleted],-2
Lol again for watson and jadhav,1
Watson will get his form back when Csk get disqualified...you can carry non performing players only when others perform and team keeps winning,2
"Anyways, I'm still surprised at Maxwell not playing good in IPL, but in international matches he provides. What could be the reason? He doesn't take IPL serious or something?",5
"Hey Punjab fans, do you want to join me praying for 1 point for each team?",2
Csk fans to jadhav after every match: fuck you and I will see you next game,6
Can't see Chennai losing today,2
I think punjab brought in players in for Karnataka players to fire back at the criticisms against kumble and rahul. They will prove that their players are better by losing to this meme team csk. And jordan ofcourse is the worst bowler ever and will defend the decision to drop him,5
"I demand that CSK play the next match against KKR also with the same team.

They shouldn't come up with some new balanced combination suddenly against KKR. We have enough of our own problems.",6
The run is already too high to attempt chasing.,46
Why was Gowtham dropped lmao,11
"So they don't drop Maxwell for struggling last match... And taking the match from difficult to unwinnable position...

But neesham is dropped because... He came in in an winnable position and got out to a thigh high fully in 7 balls...
I wish KXIP lose again...
Chris Jordan in for Neesham is garbage team selection...",7
r/cricket is ready with its dhoni hate boner,65
I see CSK preparing to end my weekend just the way they started it on Friday night.,7
CSK have decided to bring Maxwell into form today.,40
[deleted],3
Jadhav has Fleming's nudes,85
I think if they are anyway playing Jadhav then they should try out his bowling also.,6
HOW IS JADHAV STILL PLAYING? THIS IS SUCH BS,35
"Jadhav missed a few when fielding. 

He has not bowled in a while

Hasn't done shit with batting either. 

Player|Mat|Inns|NO|Runs|HS|Ave|BF|SR|4s|6s
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
KM Jadhav|5*|3|0|51|26|17.00|47|108.51|6|0
SR Watson|5*|4|0|52|33|13.00|48|108.33|3|5",15
Sab Nikal jayenge bas Jadhav Bach jayega,7
"Don't let Kedar Jadhav's recent form fool you, his record speaks for itself. 4 fifties in 83 games at a superb strike rate of 122 is nothing to sneeze at and more than makes up for his poor fielding and running between the wickets.",55
Don't get why Mujeeb still hasn't gotten a chance. I'd reckon he's been a top 3 spinner since the world cup.,3
"Ham jeet gaye, aur yaha aa gaye.",5
Kind of MI to take the fine hit so we can get seamless cricket,6
I want CSK to be humiliated just for the sheer arrogance displayed by Dhoni in selecting Jadhav,3
I would be elated if Watson and Jadhav redeem themselves today. But I have no hops about Jadhav.,2
"Two bottom scrappers duking it out tonight, wonder who is going more shite.",1
Unchanged 11 for CSK sums up csk‚Äôs ipl this year,9
[deleted],4
"Situation for today 

https://i.ibb.co/jz3Q2fX/IMG-20201004-192435.jpg",3
Either Chahar gets the openers or we see another painful csk chase,6
"No break bc, next match starts lesssgoooo",8
KXIP getting 200+ easily,1
"Jokes on clowns coming here to troll csk, because we troll ourselves.",11
"Kxip playing without an all rounder, hope that doesn‚Äôt come back to bite like the last match",2
Jio bots switching match threads to come and meme at csk. Love it,1
"They ask Gowtham to bowl the 20th over, then drop him when he gives away runs",11
"Rahul-Agarwal, Rahul has opportunity to go ahead of him, Mayank has opportunity to go well ahead of him... Aage peeche, 

Aakhir kehna kya chaahte ho Sunny G.",5
Risky,1
"Fun fact: KL, Mayank, Mandeep all played in the same u19 world cup. Ashok Menaria was the captain and Mandeep vice captain",6
Jadhav fielding ... lol..,2
Projected score 240 rip CSK,2
Chennai Senile Kings need to win this one.,6
Gowtham dropped for being a Kannadiga lol,5
Hope CSK at least makes some changes to the batting order,3
"Hope csk get destroyed today again with the help of watson,  jadhav and thala",8
"Who's gonna do the death bowling for KXIP today? Ngl, I would dig Rahul giving it a go",4
It's gonna be one of those boring forgettable matches,4
Whichever team loses probably game over for them? But won't ever count CSK out,2
"I‚Äôm really really surprised they aren‚Äôt picking Mujeeb. 

He had such an amazing tournament in the Caribbean league just before the IPL",5
"Chennai will win ,Punjab doesn't have Winners mentality",0
How do I watch on now tv plz someone,1
My team didn‚Äôt perform well...here is me hoping my favorite batsman (kL) performs well,5
Ummm Thala's nipples....,3
Gayle boi sed,10
Sucks to see gayle like that. Sad. Imagine maxwell holding his position in a team.,6
Where are sky showing this? or are they just prioritising the other post match over the actual game,2
Ppl are talking abt how csk should have changed batsman but liek with who?,6
"Sunny G and Peterson today, I don't think I can survive without breaking my phone",5
"Chad 2018 IPL CSK: promoted tail enders and still chased the total with ease and thrashed kxip

Changes in Punjab?,2
heard that ‚ÄúYAA!‚Äù echoing in the stadium,3
You know this isn't CSK's year when Jadhav hasn't injured himself yet,21

[This is the full table of ipl with the runs scored and conceeded](https://www.iplt20.com/points-table/2020)",2
Kings XI does not have really great death bowling. Thala might just get back his form against them today.,1
Bangar is so awkward lmao,2
"Prepare to spend the next 3 and a half hours hearing, reading and (might as well be) talking about Dhoni",5
Sam Curran has done nothing wrong to be get dropped what is Ashish Nehra blabbering about dhoni backs his player.,10
Guys is the crowd noise reduced in all streams or only in dugout?,0
"People shitting on team selection, you need to remember thats one of the biggest strength of Csk over the years. They don't drop the players just like that and guess what, it worked for them every freaking year.",2
Punjab with this team absolutely won't have to worry about the death overs. It won't go till there.,53
KP is adept at bringing down everyone to his level,7
Imagine having Kedhar Jadhav as a specialist no 4 .,4
I forgot Lord Thakur was present in CSK lineup. Should be fun to see him bowling against the likes of KL and Mayank.,4
Lord Thakur be taking a fifer today,8
Why the fuck is Jadhav playing? No one knows,8
Did Dhoni just woke up before the match,3
"woah thala happy

Curran thrashed for four

thala sed",9
The currans are overrated. Don't @ me,-4
Will Mandy bat above maxwell today?,3
Kannada commentator : cracking shot echoing all over Dubai,3
I actually like Punjab‚Äôs team selection today. Really well balanced,3
At least make sure Jadhav bats no higher than 10 if you want to have any chance of chasing this,4
"Both teams' fans hoping their team loses today, so their management wakes the fuck up, lol",5
"Jadhav has backing of Dhoni like Irfan Pathan had backing of Greg Chappell. Our No.3 answer to Ponting, Sangakara and Kallis was Mr. Irfan üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠",5
I can unfortunately see Curran losing his place after one more bad performance. He is not part of the clique so of course he'll be binned by Thala.,6
"Maxwell vs CSK in Dubai, okay time to go off",4
Today's match: Either KXIP bowlers will gain confidence in their Death bowling or CsK will gain confidence in their batting.,12
KL is a gift from the gods.,2
What's the hype around Mandeep? I've never seen him doing anything noteworthy except matching Kohli in bhangra steps. Overhyped!,2
Not making fantasy team let's you enjoy the game more freely.,5
Dhoni is actually a tool to still play Jadhav instead of giving chance to younsters,5
"And for Chrissakes... can we stop all these [enter international player] *didnt deserve to get dropped* bullshit. 

For the million time, the international players aren‚Äôt dropped because of weakness, but other international players are picked for their strengths.

Neesham wasn‚Äôt necessarily dropped cuz they thought he was poor, but Kings XI needed to fortify their bowling, and specifically their death bowling. And Jordan has been, over the past few years, pretty good death bowler. Simple as that.",6
How has Mayank not broke a spot in the ODI and T20I teams? He's an all format batsman that could be so valuable.,7
Swear SRH is the most boring team to watch. At least with CSK you have Dhoni and his unkill group to shit on,15
Mandeep is way better than Karun Nair in t20s,6
"in 2018 , deepak and harbhajan were promoted , they thrashed KXIP and then thala came for a complementary six. In 2020, meh...",2
Kings XI ~~Punjab~~ Bangalore,3
How many games are each team playing this season,2
Thala can fuck off for this team selection,8
"Isn't this the same Dhoni that backed going to Champions Trophy 2013 with a young inexperienced side and came back with the trophy? Why is he constantly backing oldies like Watson, Piyush and Jadhav?",12
Chawla has run enough for the day,4
Look at csk fielding all of a sudden,6
The SS Tamil commentators are taking the mickey outta Jadhav. Its hilarious,7
Chawla bruh chill,3
Play Chris Gayle the Universe Boss.,3
Juicy,2
"What sweet stuff from KL, so good to watch",3
Chawla might die if he does that again,4
"Just as i predicted before Tournament started, Nair has been dropped after 4 matches and replaced with Mandy.",5
From tamil country- Jadhav has got 23 crores in the past 3 yrs and has scored 230 runs,21
Why have Tahir and Kuldeep not played at all this IPL?,2
Can‚Äôt wait for all of CSK to find the form of their life today against KXIP of course,6
"I think CSK needs to build their team around Sam Curran, Rayudu and Du Plesis.",7
Deepak Chahar looks cute üòç,4
Rahul has become a very Consistent player in ipl. Wonder why punjab doesn't do well,7
Why is Harpreet Brar playing lol,4
The only reason Jadhav is still in the team is because Dhoni dosen't want to look like the worst batsman in the team,11
"I'll just put this here, another bad day for the spinners",1
Team that loses today will dethrone RCB as the Meme team of 2020,4
Snoozefest so far,3
Ffs please don't drop catches today.,6
Never got to know in a fight between Kohli & Kumble where did Dhoni stood? üßê,-1
Even watching CSK bowl is boring. No exciting players,-1
Pretty tight bowling to two of the leading run scorers as of now.,1
Will r/cricket circlejerk Jadhav back to form today?,4
"LOL @ CSK openers. 

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjfZwNGU0AAjMoC.png",3
I think voice dubbing is a good career choice in India these days. Everything gets dubbed in regional languages.,4
Drink Boost and bowl like Mitchell Starc? Maybe Kohli could've given Boost to RCB bowlers last few years.,3
has KXIP already played at sharjah? You can play Gayle there with mayank at 1 down..,0
Punjab should have chased,2
"""You do not see the penetration"" -Sanjay Bangar",7
"Wow, that CSK lineup looks poor.",1
Watto must be shaking his head looking at these players getting singles in the PP,6
Lot of inside edges today,3
My boi Neesham acted Sharky on Twitter and  rightly got dropped from the team,7
Listening to Nehra saying Dhoni should replace Shardul Thakur with Murli Vijay and Sam Curran with Josh Hazelwood is hilarious.,7
CSK no changes? Lmao,1
"Yaas, Graphics guy! Please keep showing that points table throughout this CSK match.",6
Dhoni is like that uncle who'd join youngsters in Gully cricket every Sunday. Thing is he's just Playing IPL on sunday üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠,14
"Jadhav- 7.8 Cr.....Duplessis- 1.6 crores

People call it auction dynamics....I call it bull shit",103
Pitch has something in it? Both batsmen are getting edges,3
Wtf is Fleming wearing,2
"Fleming losing his cool, hmmmm",3
What watch is Fleming wearing?,1
God CSK player looking so serious,3
Curran - why you do this son?,1
Stephen   F A L A M I N G,1
All the boundaries have been the same wtf,2
Curran and Chahar are the only two bowlers who look like they might take a wicket so very cautious approach from these two to see them out.,5
Lol Fleming,1
KXIP openers are too fucking good.,7
The first match was in the smallest ground and now this match is in the biggest ground. Don't think this will be a 180+ match,1
Why is Gayle not playing?,2
"All of you are surprised how Kedhar 'pulled a muscle' Jadhav is still in the team, Im surprised how he's still fit after 5 matches.",6
These two remind me of 90s odi batting under lights. Crisp drives piercing the infield. üëè,3
Anyone knows how i can watch star sports tamil  from overseas?,2
Poor Sam. Bowled over by Chad Rahul.,4
"Is it just me or 

Does anyone else get confused for David Wiese to stephen Flemming ?",-2
CSK are looking like Zimbabwe lol,4
Lol Chahar already on 3rd over.,2
Jadhav still in the playing 11? Wtf Bois,3
Cricket should be a contact sport.,3
"If these guys are still there, Chawla is gonna be taken to shreds",4
There's no chance we'll see Jadhav in the Indian team any more right?,5
"Don‚Äôt judge these two for playing non-risky shots at the moment, they are aware of the kind of batting which succeeds them",7
"Did you guys heared Bhajji making sly fun on Dhoni on news channel.



Bhajji: "" Thala(lock) Dhoni is nothing without Chabhi(Key) Raina hahaha""",7
Oh boi you don't make schoolboy Curran angry man!!!,3
Yes Mayank. Cunt him.,1
Chahar not following social distancing,3
Chahar boi touchy,4
The only good thing about CSK matches nowadays is the Tamil commentary lol,8
What would it take for IPL to consider increasing the international player quota? Let‚Äôs say by one more player.,7
That's how the virus spreads,6
"Adbhuta. Bharjari. üëè  
  
T: fantastic",1
Chahar DONT touch ppl man,6
So Gavaskar says CSK and KXIP have been unlucky this season. Why don't these commentators admit that CSK have been shit,19
Iam still searching for that young Indian player who was groomed by CSK and went on to become a top IPL player.,8
Chahar is a fuccboi,2
Last thing CSK need is a KL Mayank Classic,10
"When, in this tournament, did CSK get a 50 run opening stand?",5
Rahul-Agarwal are the Warner-Bairstow of 2020.,19
"Fleming looks fucking pissed and as a CSK fan, I can't be more delighted",3
No risks taken yet and still playing at 8 Rpo. I love these Karnataka boys,7
"Every time I see Mayank at the top of the run table, I get angry that he was in the World Cup squad but DK was played over him in the semis",10
Thala looks like he hasn't slept for 6 months,2
"I just wish KL could get his test match form back. He did the transformation from Dravid II to what he is today which in itself is remarkable, but I still would like him in tests...",5
A wicket now and commentators will start the Dhoni Cock sucking fest,5
Dhoni review system? Anyone?,3
Now i think india did such a great job in WC when bumrah broke Vijay Shankar's toe and was ruled out. I wonder they could do same to Jadhav,5
"Considering this isn‚Äôt chepauk, CSK has to play Hazelwood or Ngidi in combination with Tahir to pick wickets  and contain the opposition from scoring too much.",3
Has Mayank always been so good?,2
üö®DRS is working again üö®,3
Hawkeye still hasn't shown how close it was and commentators have already starting jerking to Dhoni's judgement.. lol,12
"MS, good to see the smile is still there",8
"Dhoni Smiling, such nostalgia",3
"Unlike MI, there are no cocky players in CSK which makes them very likeable.",18
"Watson is not just fielding he is also debriefing the game for his YouTube channel "" T20 Stars"" at the same time in his headüòÇüò≠üòÇüòÇ",7
Rahul t20 average is easily calculate just take his total runs put a decimal point between his first two digits.,2
"Punjab are playing Csk, it's not Sharjah...165 is winning total..no need to take risks now",9
"Strategy to beat CSK this season:

Win the toss and bat first forcing the senior citizens to tire themselves on the field and then sit back and watch as they don't have the energy left to bat.",69
Warner and bairstow pass on the best opening pair award to KL and Mayank,1
What is the score that will scare the shit out of uncle Dhoni which will make him give up the chase and play for NRR?,8
Dhoni knows exactly when to take the review - say the commentaors in every single match despite him having failed every single recent review calls and having failed in recent international matches tok,8
Shardul Thakur filling the mediocre quota of CSK,3
Imagine not having Mayank in the ODI swuad,11
"Shardul played a monster innings with the bat for India, right? Does anyone know which match that was?",3
Ah Sunny G! Yes We get it !,6
Thakur straight away into action.,2
Gavaskar can suck Rohit's dick even when he's not playing,58
Gavaskar masturbating of Rohit Sharma,8
Punjab's death bowling vs CSK's chasing will be peak stoppable force vs movable object,7
Yeah Sunny Ji.. Before Rohit Sharma no one in India knew how to play a pull shot.. hopefully you do remember a certain SRT..,32
"Mayank: hits a beautiful shot 

Gavaskar: *let‚Äôs give credit to Mumbaikar Rohit Sharma*",42
"I'm not sure what CSK management/leadership has thought with this selection. Picking bowlers like Chawla and Thakur that will get smacked to eternity against batsmen like KL, Mayank, Pooran etc. Then picking batsmen like Watson and Jadhav to bat against bowlers like Shami, Bishnoi and Cottrell. Chances before the match even started would've been in Kings XI's favour.",2
Everyone talking about how CSK is the meme team this season but y'all forgetting about how KXIP has basically been RCB 2.0 this season.,2
"Mayank hits a classy boundary


Sunny G: Rohit Sharma is Don Bradman",113
Will Poonjab win this?,2
"See CSK, this is what happens when you suck too much stale cock at the auction",3
Nehra in Dugout :(,5
The 6th over is statistically one of the most expensive overs of the game. MI gives that over to their legend Bumrah and we give to our legend Shardul Thakur.,11
I still remember a time when most of the Indian batsmen couldn‚Äôt play pull or hook shots,6
"KL isn't taking any risks. Yeah, he doesn't trust his team's middle order.",8
Punjab c'mon,1
Why has Thala become Nala,4
Man MS's age is clearly visible on his face,4
"If the Senile Kings concede more than 160, it's goodbye for them.",3
"Yeah dumbass, a top level ranji player learned the front foot pull by looking at Rohit Sharma on TV",27
Csk bowling is not threatening at all,3
Gavaskar sucking Rohit and Nehra sucking up to Dhoni perfectly balanced.,18
Anything above 150 will be too much for us :(,7
DK smiled so much after KKR's lose that we are now at the top of the Fairplay award.,10
"Did Nehra just say drop Curran for muraIi Vijay 

Ahhahahaha",19
Thats a lot of hair on Thakur‚Äôs head,2
"It's a shame Punjab is being clubbed together with Chennai. One team has been unlucky af, legit, while the other has been the undisputed fucking worst side of the competition. I fucking hate these spineless commentators for not stating that. I really hope Punjab cunt CSK just to make it clear that CSK are in fact the worst side in the competition.",14
"""I'll suck Brohit's dick whenever an Indian plays a pull shot"" - Sunny G.",15
Is it Mark Nicholas currently?,1
So on a scale of 1-10 how badly will CSK botch today's chase?,3
Nehra wants Vijay back in the team? Curran is getting greedy ? Wtf is wrong with him,12
Nehra is chatting absolute shit or am I wrong?,8
"All the people who talk about Dhoni all the time, be it the experts in the commentary box or the experts in these threads honestly take the fun out of the game. 21 other players including players like Rahul and mayank who are on a roll and all we hear is Dhoni.",15
CSK haven't even a single time batted first this tournament. This could be one of the reasons top order is under performing under pressure situations,2
"Dhoni : That wasn't a bad powerplay! 

Watto : Wait till they get a load of me!",3
Lmao pollard in that lenskart ad,10
Weekly reminder that Thakur travels on local trains in Mumbai. Now we all are supposed to like him even if he bowls trash.,7
Nice to see KKR on top of something,3
Number of bucks earned is directly proportional to number of dicks sucked.,2
Was really looking forward to see Neesham bat and shut up Akash Chopra üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,3
Atleast they aren't showing that fucking white hat jr. Today,8
How do you rate the start for kings? Should they keep the rate or step it up?,4
MX takatak? Seriously?,3
What the fuck is mx takatak?,2
"I know CSK is not batting well. But, King's XI should underestimate them at their own peril.

If the top order gets set, Kings XI should taget 180+",7
"If Dhoni can bowl in the OPPO app why can't he bowl for CSK or India?

Dhoni loves OPPO more than India and CSK confirmed. \#Sellout",0

Incoming 6 slow balls.,7
"Love to see Bravo get sent to the cleaners, hope to see that again tonight",2

I hate slowers man,0
Nehra is the impostor,5
"*Bravo comes to crease*

Rihanna : üòí",15
They should accelerate now. Pooran is coming in form. He needs to be there asap,3
Wanna see some slow dipping yorkers by bravo for orgasmic purposes,1
That was wide even for a left hander,5
Is Bravo older than Dhoni ? Coz when he runs it looks like there are heavy bricks tied to his shoes.,3
What the fuck was that delivery lol.. age problem,3
Lenskart need to provide glasses to bravo,5
kL sLoW bAtTiNg üôÑ,3
Couldn't find the match thread wanted to shit on Nehra really hard,4
Would be funny if Kxip end up with orange and purple cap while also being last in the table,28

Outstanding player,T20 Specialist,Indian Don Bradman of Test,Classy ODI Player VS Some NRR Boi with six hitting ability.",9
"I know KL is the hot flavour right now and certainly more talented, but for me the star for KXIP has been Mayank since the first match.. such exquisite shots every innings with so much confidence is refreshing to see..",6
"Isn't one of the umpires that guy who got scolded by Dhoni last IPL for some bad no ball call or something?
I vaguely remember Dhoni walking into the field to give this guy a mouthful....",2
Lmao proper fighting in Dugout,2
Dugout down the drain,5
Maxwell vs CSK in uae oh no,4
Swann Sushed out Nehra so bad,6
Lol nehra interrupting Swann,4
I think Kl will try to anchor till 15th over and Mayank will be accelerating,9
Chennai once had a luxury of playing stupid sexy santner,7
Nehra explained all those selection blunders in RCB last year suggesting to drop Curran.,22
Is the pitch slow today.. or are they bowling toooo sloow,2
Wides-Highest scorer of this season.,2
SunnyG you funny,7
Sunny has started smoking,1
Bravo to Rahul : Daura diya bc!,2
Bravo already tired. Might need rest for the next two weeks to recover,3
They have gots to accelerate,2

Do you folks think the openers will put up a 100 run partnership at the minimum? By the 13th over?,2
Imagine having top two run scorers and top two wicket takers in your team and still winning only one match,39
I hate this anchor thing in T20s. Accelerate already.,4
Jesus Swann calm down,2
Nehra vs Swann Lol,3
Nehra wants Watson to stay because he played a match winning innings 2 years ago but don't want Curran in the side who's literally their best player this season,40
Dugout questioning Dhoni's team selection as they should,10
Wow. Damn good slow Yorkers Bravo,8
Tuk tuk Rahul,3
Punjab know 140 is enough,2
Who's Harpreet Brar?,1
"No problem KL, we just need to get to 160 and it's done",2
I kinda miss Ashwin captaining KXIP,3
Still remember young Bravo being absolute lightening in the field.,9
SunnyG asking questions which I only ask when high,9
Omg you cursed it,3
"Bravo so dedicated to CSK that he's even wearing yellow underwear.

\#Yellove",8
Is it just me or bravo is looking tired early on in this game?,4
We're so screwed.,1
"Two guys at the top of batting charts and KXIP languishing at the bottom of the table.

Just KXIP things. Consistently snatching defeats from jaws of victory is their specialty over the years.",8
"rahul using up almost a 1/4 of the deliveries for a paltry 25 runs, his batting has been too slow since that century",1
140 is enough on this pitch to win for punjab. CSK will probably make a 28/2 in 5 overs,4
"Genuine question, why can't batsmen treat Bravo as a spinner since most of his deliveries are slower balls anyways.",1
I want jagadeesan for Jadhav pls.,1
Kannada commentary : dafuq does Bravo do with the ball. He mixes it up like a mad man. Lol,8
Not an ipl if bravo ain't dancing,8
KL Rahul now ahead in the Orange Cap race,9
One of Rahul or Mayank definitely gonna WIN Orange Cap as they will not try to throw their wicket,9
"If KXIP want to really show that they've just been unlucky and they're not in the same category as CSK, I think a big opening stand from these two would show it. It's the one of the biggest things that CSK completely lacks.",11
"How stupid of me to bet on CSK

Heart over head ffs",7
Bravo needs intravenous saline water for recovery in between overs.,5
Only thing missing from KXIP line up is Preity Zinta,7
Bravo looks so reluctant to bowl,8
I cannot believe Nehra is suggesting to replace Curran for Hazelwood and not Watson for Hazelwood.,5
"u/RLKay what do u think about the prospect of dropping Kane to bring in Nabi? At least in Sharjah.

I say this because we are basically feeding our opponents 50 runs from the 4 part-time overs. It will be worse next time we play here:(",3
CSK after 7 would be 35/3 lol,8
Waiting for CSK's  beautiful 16/2 in the power play,9
"In a few years, CSK team will remain the same but only difference will be the players will come on the field in wheelchairs",8
"I know CSK aren't batting now, but when you have someone like Jadhav coming in before Bravo and even Jadeja, they deserve to lose.",1
This match is so refreshing. Watching the game at Sharjah is not entertaining at all.,2
Chilled batting,1
"**Most partnership runs by an Indian opening pair in a IPL season**

579 Dravid-Rahane 2012 (16 innings)

566 Uthappa-Gambhir 2016 (15 innings)

529 Sehwag-Gambhir 2008 (14 innings)

490 Uthappa-Gambhir 2014 (11 innings)

422 Uthappa-Gambhir 2015 (13 innings)

360* KL Rahul-Mayank 2019 (5 innings)

*Cricinfo*",9
So Nehra was the one simping for Dhoni,1
CSK fans tryna reverse jinx it here,2
CSK bowling first in every match till now,1
Reverse jinxing seems to be back in trend,1
Santner wearing Hazlewood shirt? Surely CSK can afford to give him his own shirt?,22
"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to put a curse on him‚Äù

> Jinxes him",3
Punjab needs to just get 160. And get the top order out. Then our great middle order will belive in themselves to hit 60 from 3 overs instead of Fucking doing 60 from 6 overs.,7
"If you find any cum stains in the Altroz,it's prolly Swann.",14
Is that wakhara swag song?,4
I feel like Punjab's middle order is gonna come to form with csk bowling.,5
Why doesn't Dhoni ever bowl Jadhav? The entire point of having him is that he's an all rounder. Did Jadhav forget to bowl or something?,12
Regular commentary or dugout?,1
Lmao imagine being a 22 yr old and playing with retired dudes and uncles and dads of 2 and players double your age.,10
Wait why aren't CSK playing hazzlewood?,2
I switched to watching the French open after the last match. Oh man it feels soo good not to have any ads or continuous sponsor plugs. Would hate shit like ‚ÄúToyota Break point of the match‚Äù or some crap like that,8
Which CSK dude just came to the ground? And for what?,2
Even 2+e is dropping catches,6
Faf :( :( Nothing is going our way.,8
Faf dropped? damn,2
This time they are targeting 160. That's the par score for csk lol,2
"Some folks at r/Cricket : Remove Watson, bring Hazelwood and open with Curran.

Also some folks at r/Cricket : Fucking stop opening with Narine.

The duality of r/Cricket",1
"Dugout suggesting a rift between Dhoni and Fleming, if I am not reading into things too much",4
"India has a very pleasing selection headache for opening spots.

Rahul, Mayank, Rohit, Dhawan, Gill, Shaw all firing and looking good",3
Foakes would‚Äôve caught that,3
What an effort... If DePussy couldn't catch it then no one can..,3
"Probably the only game time Santner is going to get this season, poor lad",6
Faf dropped a catch. Wow.,9
"Gn bois, this was an early sign that today is yet another classic CSK match",10
Should have tried flying like Pandey,5
Man Fleming is not happy today,6
Vinay Kumar is on air. Was he released from MI?,2
"What is Swann hinting at, 'something going on above'?",3
Man Fleming hasn't been this expressive like ever,6
They would‚Äôve been really harsh if that were an Indian fielder,0
this game is really boring so far. both from a batting and bowling perspective.,3
Wow.. Fleming is too animated today.. seems the defeats are getting to the entire staff..,19
What leverage has Jadhav got on Dhoni?,6
"Faf du Plessis is not wearing yellow underwear which means he doesn't like CSK.

\#FafIsTheImpostor",47
"Sir Chuteja in, will he get hit for 40+ in his overs again or will he manage to save himself? Find out in the next episode of Dragon Ball Z!",6
Dugout Indian guy calling du plessi Fap pussy,10
Kl is basically playing for his average cause he knows even a mediocre score will be enough here,-8
Santner is better than Jadeja as a T20 player. Sad he can‚Äôt get in the team,3
Petition to send fleming to the commentary box and use commentators curse as a tactic.,3
2020 is so bad that even Fleming is getting mad.lol,31
I can feel rahul and Mayank frustrated inside,9
Is there a backup wicketkeeper and captain material in CSK?,5
"Yikes, Fleming is also pissed now. I have seen everything",8
"Think it's time to get the acceleration going, but seems like it is kinda hard to do so",9
How serial shitposter Nehra managed to convince execs at star to put him in the dugout I‚Äôll never understand,63
Wasn't nehra RCB bowling coach? Why did they fire him,1
"Commentator: Dhoni never shows any emotions as a captain





Me remembering Dhoni blasting Ashwin every time he gave away more than 10 runs",14
"**Opening partnerships for KXIP¬†in IPL2020**

Gifted it.. literally.. that too to freaking Chawla.,6
Gifted,1
You gave it away Agarwal.... Chawla didn't deserve it,6

Strikes first ball!,1
KL going too slow.,1
[deleted],2
Fuck. Only KL & Pooran left now. Into the tail!,3
Fuck Chawal like you hate him Pooran,2
This is textbook village cricket. Pacers steam in swinging the ball all around and then fat old spinner chucks one in and gets a wicket.,28
Big boi chawla has arrived bois,1
"WTF, I love Chawla now.",3
Brain fade moment üòí,2
"Tjat‚Äôs terrible from Mayank, poorer than Manish‚Äôs dismissal",3

Hope Pooran doesn't thrash Jadeja now,1
Lol chawla just won't leave us alone will he?,6
Hopefully no youngster signs for CSK henceforth. Must be so demoralizing,2
Chawla is such a big dick wicket taker,1
Fuck everything and open with Hussey.,3
"OMFG why would you say that ""oh there is the signal"" I legit thought that this would be called a noball",4
"Was expecting a 20 run over, instead got a wicket. Still waiting for the 20 runs though.",2
No problem.. 140 will be enough.. with jadhav coming in at 4 we will reach 108 by 19th over and lose by 7 runs in the end,3
"With the hair and the jewelry together, Bravo looks like a late-in-her-career Nina Simone to me...",7
Jadhav and Ceat ‚Äústrategic ‚Äú time out - two most unwanted things here,3
What is this behaviour Mayank?,3
Never seen Fleming this animated,2
Daily reminder that Piyush Chawla is Younger than Virat Kohli,102
"*Bowler takes wicket*


Commentators: Brilliant captaincy by Dhoni to use bowlers like that",13
Why does Chawla look so resigned from life,5
Baby faced assasin Chawla,3
Is Bravo injured. They said something in the commentary but I missed it,2
"I don't know about that idiot 10 years back , but the current CSK twitter intern is pretty wholesome",11

""Think Dhoni should replace him with Josh Hazelwood.""",75
Who's coming in? Mandeep or Pooran?,1
Kl needs to show dhoni today how deep he can bat,5
"I know Maxi has been bad this season, but Punjab really need to bat him 3. Unlike Russell, he knows how to construct an innings and giving him more time will give him the best chance to succeed. Even in his T20I career, Maxi's best knocks have been when he's had plenty of time to bat. No point sending him in at 100/3 in the 16th over and being pissed when he gets out.",6
What‚Äôs MSD drinking?,2
"Slip, lol.",1
Dhoni should replace Fleming as the coach before next season in all seriousness.,6

I‚Äôm rooting for Mandeep. A lot of team underdogs have done so well this IPL,11
Just open with Sam and drop Watson for Tahir. Problem solved,3
Mandeep the specialist strike rotator,3
"Rubbish balls have been very effective at getting batsmen out today, maybe bowling halftrackers is the way to go",2
This fucking Chawla always turns up against us,2
Why kedar even exist ?,7
Honestly it's fun having Nehra in the Dugout.,2
nehra is just not right for dugout,7
Rahul carry job commences once more.,3
KL and Mandeep should rotate strike consistently and punish bad balls which will come eventually. Dots are the recipe of disaster in slow pitches against spin which is why Karun was useless here.,4
"*No simp September ends*

Commentators: Give MS Dhoni 10 pieces of log he will give you an IPL trophy",6
"is *""Jay Jay Vijay Shankar the way you bowl that bouncer ""* playing this match?",2

Why are Punjab fans shitting over Rahul strike rate. Honestly we will take that any day over Watson,10
Good call resting Nair for Mandeep.,1
Why is Gayle not in the playing 11?,1
Wassup with KL man,1
Should've sent pooran. He needs more balls.,2
Thala should bowl he will take a hattrick.,8
All the momentum is gone from KXIP‚Äôs innings with these 2 overs of spin,3
Piyush 31yo Chawla just won't leave us alone ffs,5
[bruh](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjfhpXnVgAElmCk.jpg),3
KL please I want you to bang them today,6
Very helpful of KXIP to send in another rhb so Jadeja can be at peace,3
God I hate KP's commentary,1
"That article about top order batsman getting away with low scoring rate was spot on. 

A middle order or lower batsman would be absolutely crucified if they scored at this rate.",10
Kl you've already secured your spot on the odi team ffs,4
"People who saw me in MI vs SRH know my fantasy curse, well, I picked both Mayank and KL. I got one right so far",1
[deleted],4
Mandeep already far better than that moron karun,4
"Whatever free award I get, it goes to a cricket thread. 


That's how it is done.",6
Why tf they treating Jadeja & Chawla as if they are a legend spinner combo.,6
"CSK has Kedar, RCB has Gurkeerat, KXIP has Sarfaraz. Who are the other players who are hardly contributing anything but still starting every game?",6
Is this ground big or tiny?,1
"Wow, Jaddu is bowling economically",1
CSK getting back into this game.,1
Come on lads. Up your scoring rate now!,1
pedestrian batting. i think the losses have made kl overly cautious.,3
"For shits and giggles, Jadhav needs to bowl an over ü§£",2
"Should open with Sam Curran and Watson today 

I would even go for Chahar at no.3

For once try to score some runs in the powerplay even if lose 2-3 wickets 

It‚Äôs not we don‚Äôt have Jadhav to tuk tuk if we lose few wkts in powerplay",4
Almost as if Rahul looked at Jadhav and thought- Ok we have enough,6
"After watching two consecutive games at Sharjah, feels weird to not see every other ball go for a six",1
Still KL needs to stay there to get to 160. CSK aren't gonna chase anything beyond that he knows,2
deepa malik stop shilling for white hat jr shittt,3
What's wrong with faf xD,1
"Now more than half of Dugout panel is irritating. Banger, Badri and now Nehra. They just say useless stuff. Styris and swanny are just ok. Lara and Binga are the only ones I can listen to. Miss Deano",5
A reminder that even FaF can misfield.,3
Nice test match here should be stumps in half an hour,3
Faf? you good?,2
Seems Faf's leg is feeling better,2
[piyush is my spirit animal](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFlkAJ1pe1N/?igshid=16nwqmt0jz5lq),2

Wtf happened to Faf,3
Why does Faf seem so down? First with the drop and now this?,5
Fucking amazing strike. This is set,2
Shot boi,2
"Bad strategy from KXIP to send Mandeep now ,should have sent Pooran",2
Yo what is happening. Misfield by Faf,5
Faf is distracted,3
Mandeep are you targeting that space?,3
"That's why you play Mandeep, not Nair",5
C'mon Mandeep.. this is your bitch. Bang,3
Did that 6 hit Altroz lmao,6
Karun Nayar played instead of this guy,8
that sound was orgasmic,2
lmao mandeeps already been more useful than nair,3
Okay Faf fucked up in fielding we are winning the game!,2
"You have 10 wickets for 20 overs. 

Let‚Äôs say 7 of them can bat, then you are hurting your team if you are scoring less than 25 (17)",3
Smart batting,2
CSK need ashwin back,3
Punjab fans forgetting that KL and Mayank have scored most of the runs and one of them being there at the end means both batsmen can go bonkers without pressure.,12
Lol someone in hotstar Comment section is asking why is sehwag not playing,67
Mandeep 'fuck karun nair' Singh,11
Mandeep looking more confident than Rahul,11
friendship with Nair ended. Mandeep is my new bestie,12
Glen Max-imum,3
"Phew, I had typed up a rant comment on Mandeep. Thank God I didn't hit submit before he hit the six üòÅ",3
Well done Mandy. Six and a single is making Gavaskar jizz.,10
Mandeep massive upgrade over Nair,11
Fleming fuming,5
This is what mayank was trying to doo,6
Mandeep has scored more runs than maxwell this ipl.,7
Noice Mandeep!,2
"KL reminding me of VK, taking the innings with him and letting the others smash",4
Why was mandeep kept under wraps in place of Karun,9
"Pieterson when Delhi bowls: Spinners has to sliw down
Pietersen when Jadeja balls: Jadeja has to speed up. Jeez, we rhought we were spared from Sanjay Manjarekar commentary and this shit happens",5
Is that really Mandeep Singh?,6
*Even CSK of Sharjah cannot chase this*,4
That should secure mandeeps place in the team,3
Is Chawla the worst leg spinner in the tournament?,6
CSK fans - Williamson or Ashwin...who would you take?,4
Karun was playing for this guy how do you explain that üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,12
He has outperformed Karun already,6
KL helping chawla with retirement,8
Fleming would have died coaching RCB,8
"Idk why  I always wanted Mandeep to succeed even in his RCB days, hope he scores big today",23
"Fleming is like, fuck this shit",5
Chennai chasing again? Oh no!!,3
Imagine benching local boi mandy and playing with all banglore fffs,4
miss you Mandeep,3
"Ok, Karun Nair done for this IPL",3
Is Fleming on psychedelics?,4
Do this to fuck face Chawala Mandy üòç,3
Just tuned in and thought hey maybe we have a chance. I'm leaving again.,1
Fleming making this entertaining,1
Because of csk faf is sad.,3
"Honestly I'm enjoying this CSK meme team, even as a big fan of CSK. No longer need to worry about getting heart attacks every game.",3
Don't understand what happened to Kaptain,2
How are maxwell and pooran supposed to improve if you wont let them play. Either bench maxwell or let him come up the order.,1
If piyush is the main spinner Csk have no hope...jadeja isnt in great touch... difficult to get Tahir in...,5
CSK fielding exposed,1
"KXIP has jordan today, good chance for CSK to capitalize.",4
Mah boi Mandeep died all these days for kaptain,7
"Mandeep is seriously the most unlucky player , played well for RCB down the order hasn't been used well anywhere",2
Karun Nair stole a living off Mandeep in the name of one triple hundred he scored a few years ago.,3
"Karun Nair is paid 5.6 CR and Mayank Agarwal is paid 1 CR. Just kinda funny, nothing else.",7
Surely there's a better nickname for Fleming than phlegm,3
Is Jadeja a good bowlers ? Why don't batsman go after him?,3
Good thing is we don't have to finish Chawlas quota anymore,2
"The Geriatric Kings are gonna lose this one, aren‚Äôt they?",2
Agent KL today ?,6
The fuck is Rahul doing,5
I dont know why but all the ex-rcbian play far better in other teams. Maybe something to do with expectations,7
Why is Rahul playing the tuktuk game wtf,3
"The thing people aren't understanding is that KL's role in this situation has changed from just spanking bad balls to the boundary to controlling the innings till the final overs. If KL goes, there isn't anyone who can steer the innings, they're all mainly power hitters.",9
KL struggling so much. But i trust him to bat deep effectively,5
Why the flying fuck did we buy Chawla?,1
"35 out of 35, not even trying for 2s",2
KL is 36 balls 36. He wants to carry his bat.,3
Rahul alright  enough bro,2
KL playing proper ODI innings,2
"Having secured his place in the LOI team, here we see the KL trying to knock Pant off the test team.",4
"Tbh every run mandeep scores is a welcome bonus for kxip, the brunt of the force is in the dugout in the likes of pooran and maxwell",3
If you remove Rj Balaji..tamil commentary gets boring...others are diplomatic and boring...,6
This is how you play on big grounds you dildos,3
"I am so amazed that people are been taking lessons from my team :-

First RR followed our NRR rule and so did other teams like KKR.

Now everyone seems to be taking notes from Jadhav and Vijay of playing slow.

T.Curran followed our legend Dhoni's batting strategy.

Everyone is now practicing fair play due to us.

Everyone is taking NRR seriously thanks to our team.

I am proud of you,CSK.",2
Target above 100 is a tough ask for CSK,4
Stop shitting on Rahul. Ofc he‚Äôs playing like this cuz the middle order is largely untested,4
We are fucked.,3
Played well Mandeep,2
God fking damnnit..........,2
"I have a special liking for Mandeep because he was a part of the good ol' KXIP squad back in 2011/12 which was led by Gilly. 

Ah. Gilly, Shaun Marsh, Valthaty, Mandeep, Vohra, Bhargav Bhatt, DK, PK. Loved that side. Came agonizingly close twice to qualifying for the playoffs. One of the best underdog sides in IPL history.",12
Ffs,2
Good job by Mandy. 27(15) is great for a T20,5
Who is CSK Russell?,2
Fuck yess.,6
Needed to lift that up,2
Flemo about to get a stroke.,3
Unlucky Mandy. Really looked like he was going to go big tonight.,6
This is all on Rahul,1
Fuck these wicket alerts,5
Almost dropped,2
That's what a 3D player looks like,7
Damn it you did well man,3
"Padikkal, Nair, Pandey, Agarwal = there‚Äôs no Kannadiga in this Karnataka squad",2
Goddamn Swann was right.,4
"Rahul has no faith in his middle order, has to go quicker though here.",6
Nooooo!!,4
Why mandeep why?,3
Seeing a smile on Jadeja's face the first time this season,6
smh,1
Karun nair in for mandeep next match. Terrible lol. Karnataka players can do better than that,0
Why are Dugout guys being biased for CSK?,4
"**11.6** Jadeja to Mandeep Singh, OUT,  **94-2**

Mandeep Singh c Rayudu b Jadeja 27 (16b 0x4 2x6) SR: 168.75",3
Stfu Rahul fams. This score is already enough for Punjab.,5
Mandeep played his role. Now if the international players can do the same...,5
"Mandeep leaves rcb, starts timing the ball like a god ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",11
Mandeep Singh is the most punjabi you can get,17
Good cameo over there.,7
Poor Mandeep. KLPD isn‚Äôt accelerating,7
Cricinfo listing Watto and Jadhav as all rounders,15
"Why is Fleming pissed  seems something off , guess some issues with jadeja",5
Greame Swann you goddamn genius!!!!,8
I think KX has decided that this is gonna be their strategy. KL will play as lynchpin and everyone else will go boom boom.,6
"Its okay, listed done acceleration. If Maxwell and Pooran do their jobs effectively we are good

Pros: won't have to see Karun anymore",7
Maxi.... I think you're being hyped again and again.... Please prove me wrong,2
"That's was just unfortunate,well played Mandy, shabash jatta.",4
KL teasing Dhoni with his tuk-tuk game.,8
"Fuck. KL, you better make up for this in the end",5
"After winning the 2012 Emerging player of the season award, Mandeep never got his form back in IPL. Really unfortunate",9
Nehra and one other guy are the only Indians who just casually chat on the dugout. The rest just sound way too nervous like they're in a corporate meeting where they get points for pitching in. The fake accents with the rolling tongue 'r's don't help with the impression either.,5
Is Sarfraz a finisher?,1
"Just joined, why is Rahul's strike rate at 102? Is he planning to do a **tewatia**",7
"I mean Fleming looks super pissed but surely he should bear some responsibility too alongwith MS in team selections. 

How Kedar Jadhav continues to play every game after scoring 160 odd runs at a strike rate of 95 last season and having an abysmal campaign this year too, I'll never know",10
"If I decrease the voice, I can't hear the commentary.

If I increase the voice, my parents shout at me because of loud voice.

Damn, I hate that fake crowd thing.",6
"Every player who leaves RCB becomes very good.

Seems shady,Doesn't it??",5
Looks like kl planned that dismissal to bring his buddy pooran at the crease.,3
KL frustrated,3
"KXIP need a 20 balls 50 type knock from Pooran or Maxwell from here, or Rahul to go berserk like he did against RR",6
Pooran needs to bring the acceleration.,3
Mark said Rahul is in great nick ... I agree. Great nick for ODIs for sure.,5
Rahul playing the anchor it seems.,6
Bravo has stopped releasing songs now??,8
Shardhul diving after the ball reached the boundary.lol,2
kl pulling off a dhoni here,8
Dhoni should just permanently place Watson in the first slip. No point in having him elsewhere.,11
Anything above 170 & we will shit the bed. That's how it is sadly,8
CSK is missing the trick by not playing R Sai Kishore here. He is tailor made for Abu Dhabi pitch and will bowl far better than Uncle Chawla.,7
"If KXIP don't play Gayle in all of their Sharjah matches, it'd be poor selection",9
r/Cricket wants every batsman to hit at 400 strike rate otherwise this is a test match.,11
Anything above 160-170 is going to be difficult for CSK to chase here.,5
damn Rayudu nearly put that down,7
"Dugout can atleast try and act unbiased.




Cheering when KXIP loses wicket and disappointed when KL scores boundary ffs",6
KL Rahul playing like a ODI,6
KL started making waves already for the 2023 WC selection,6
Tuk tuk boring comments when,4
Chennai‚Äôs players/base looking very tensed. Chill brothers,4
Missing Tahir chacha,3
"All KXIP fans rooting for Maxwell, he will not score good ,He is the man who will score a 6 ball 16 and 10 ball 20 and get out.",9
Will KL do an AB today. I think so,3
last batsman pair on crease. all tailenders after this,6
is it just me that thinks we should bring in Gayle for Maxwell and play him at 3?,5
Rayudu has already done more than everything 3D has done since getting picked for CWC2019.,3
"Dhoni is an all time great cricketer who is having a hard time maintaining his reputation as a batsman as he gets older and his reflexes get slower.

Let's move on with our lives r/cricket . Please.",9
KL did the same thing in 2019 IPL. Costed us some games.,3
"Its weird seeing someone as cool as Bravo wear a skin sleeve, something a depressed emo teen would wear.",1
"Rahul you are destroying us bro, just hit something you moron",-1
Rahul thinks this is a test match,2
Fleming is definitely not in a good mood today.,3
"‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôve dropped some catches,
That have cost them matches‚Äù

- Lil‚Äô Sunny G",7
At least 170+ please. I want to watch how Dhoni chases today.,6
"Tamil commentary is insanely funny. About Rayadu's catch - ""He did not catch that ball, the ball caught him"".",8
"Forget Jadhav, I wanna know what Sarfaraz Khan is doing in Punjab‚Äôs squad",9
"Rahul has been batting wayyyyyyyy too conservative this season. Even in the RCB match, he was headed towards a normal century (slow by his standards) before those two drop catches. Sharjah too, he was slow. Responsibility fucking with his head?",3
Only 1.1k comments? WTF happened?,6
"I'm liking Rayudu pulling out the towel, meaning dew maybe. If CSK don't chase this, I will switch to supporting RCB.",6
I am pretty sure most youngsters pray during auctions that they don‚Äôt get picked by CSK because they know that they will be warming the benches for the whole season and most probably won‚Äôt get a chance to play.,4
"Dwayne bravo looks dull this season for some reason, not in performance but dull",7
"KL wants to make sure he stays till the end and get the team to a respectable score, I get it. But holy shit 40 at run a ball is not helping it.",9
Stop wasting time,2
I just feel like today is Pooran's day,3
I'm curious how CSK's approach would be today with the bat,5
Kayle ra√∫l playing a test innings,3
KL is doing fine. Wait till you guys see CSK openers in this pitch,7
"It is so impressive how DJ Bravo shows up in every t20 league of the world and does his thing again and again, delivering what's asked of him more often that not. 

Never thought back in 2006 when he bowled that memorable over that included slower, dipping yorkers to Yuvraj Singh in that ODI series that he will not play much for his country and his career would turn out like this. He is the only player from his generation who found so much success in t20 cricket, and the likes of Pollard and Narine and Russell followed suit, while Gayle was always pretty good in international cricket as well.",8
"Punjab has been bowling excellently in powerplays and CSK been complete shit. Rahul has the right approach. If he‚Äôs there till the end, Punjab will get 180 atleast and CSK will easily choke in the powerplay",7
KL taking it deep,2
"Miss those days when strong Csk spinning core used to strangle opposition at Chepauk
Then Dhoni unnecessarily taking the 150 odd chase to the last over and winning",4
KL innings might cost the game here.,1
"Poor Kl, guess thats what Maxwell at 5 makes you do LOL",0
KL just following Dhoinism and trying to increase his average by being not out.,2
The commercial's everywhere in the IPL is either laughable or sickening depending on your mood.,6
Csk looks dull this year. Just doesn't feel the same as last 2 years. I guess something is wrong with the management.,3
Maxwell has been shit in IPL since forever.,5
Man that ad did dirty on pollard.,2
"Bangar with the jokes on dugout, has done a tewatia with his dugout stints.",2
Abu Dhabi T10 League version of Nicholas Pooran please,3
Have a feeling Maxi is going to come out good today,1
Imagine if KL got out right now. He took his time and everything to blast at the end but it would be cruel for KXIP. YOu gotta make \~55 if you play 40 so that even if you get out at the wrong time it is decent PLUS partner at the other end doesn't feel too much pressure. I am well aware he can make up for it but I am imagining a particular scenario.,4
Who did Mandeep come in place of in todays Match?,1
If you have to choose between maxwell and Jadeja who would you choose?,0
"Hope to see Pooran go big today, think he‚Äôs a real talented player",2
Punjab doesn‚Äôt bat deep. KL is playing the right role...he won‚Äôt charge in till the last few overs,6
Is Rahul trying to get his test spot back?,1
CSK's batting is heavily reliant atm on Faf playing a big innings and Sam coming in at the end to smack. If somehow any other player plays a decent innings its a bonus. It's really not a good look on the batting lineup.,9
What's up with KL?,1
Wtf defense in T20,7
Are they seriously playing a song from Udta Punjab?,4
when was the last time maxwell played good inning in ipl?,3
KL has to hold it from one end. Without neesham and gowtham they are lacking batsman down the order and with this Maxwell's form,5
"KL can't get out now, he needs to make a hundred today at any cost",1
What is this shithouse batting from KL?,0
I remember Maxwell scoring 4-5 90s in a season for KXIP. He was in the top 3 run scorers that year. He has been shit since then. Only playing because of his reputation.,2
"Dear Nehra ji,

*Wicket kya gaand mein rakh kar swarg le jayenge kya?*

Just hit our get out ffs. Maxi is in the sheds. 

Trans: will we take the wickets home?",4
"I just want to see both teams to not give up till the last ball. That's all I ask. Even though CSK is a rival team, I have always liked their tactics in field but this year something is off.",3
imagine playing against csk and you get criticised playing at a SR 100 as an opener,6
Rahul should bat a bit more freely,1
I want to see Rahul & Mayank get out in 2 overs & see what happens with Punjab,2
"Lol if you think this is slow, wait for the second inning.",13
"Last 5 overs, 80 runs has been the flavor of IPL",3
Maybe Kl is waiting for his 50 to explode,2
"I really hope that Pooran won't shit the bed today.
Shit would be exciting if there was a super over.",2
How much umpires will get paid ?,2
Pooran looks like a young KL Rahul,4
Yes.. fuck'em pooran,3
"people shitting on Rahul need to remember that if he'd gone big and got out for 20, our hopeless middle order would've probably scored a combined 20 anyways",17
Cunted away. No point respecting a spinner that isn't spinning the ball.,12
We might have landed on the perfect batting combination somehow,7
"If a wicket falls in the end overs, Jordan should be sent ahead of Maxwell. He‚Äôs real underrated",2
ü•±ü•±ü•±ü•±,-1
welp,1
I dunno why but I badly want a super over today even if my favourite team doesn't  win.,0
200 seems possible now,1
what a shot that was,8
seems Rahuls gonna tick the scoreboard and every other batsman has the license to go for it,8
This may be the first innings where the chances of 200 are slim,6
I like how the euphoria of ktk players at kings xi is slowly turning into quota conspiracy.,7
Punjab realizing Jaddu is shitty spinner 3 overs too late,3
It‚Äôs Jordan‚Äôs birthday today I think,7
This was a good spell by jadeja considerably,2
pooran is just fitter hetmyer without that omelette as a hairstyle,6
How the fuck did this CSK win their game against the most successful team in the IPL?,7
"KL ,Mayank, Mandy, Pooran now if maxi finds form we can clear the playoff from here",6
WhiteHat Jr. mom looks like Roza Diaz.,2
Looks like we'll be chasing 180+ . Oh well another loss I guess,7
What's with people wearing 2 caps?,2
Pooran shots are so easy on the eyes,2
Mayank in the dugout with Gayle looks like a 6 y.o kid telling something to his dad very enthusiastically and his dad just smiling,10
"If Rahul gets out now, it's a shitty innings",1
It‚Äôs cute when people think they know better than the player who has been playing the game for years.,6
Tuk tuk Rahul,1
180 in the cards,1
"Not a big fan of soaking up 40+ balls before exploding. I can see what KL is thinking and it might pay off, but it is a tad selfish. KXIP are in a good position though.",6
I won't blame Rahul. He's literally the only player carrying this team since the Ashwin days. He knows that punjab is shit without him.,3
Nice nice nice nice nice nice nice,1
KL playing dots to his Lord Shardul,2
Finally a release from KL. Mature 50 today.,2
Kxip completing the Karnataka quota along with the punjabi quota and birthday quota and blm quota,5
Gayle is needed as a replacement for Maxwell at least he might tonk 3-4 sixes before getting out and put the team in a comfortable position. No one tonking Shardul is unbelievable.,4
180 on the cards.,2
Rahul's gonna do an AB I fucking know it,3
this middle over acceleration is exactly what CSK lacks.,11
Another 50 best batsmen in the tournament since 2018,5
KL‚Äôs sixes are so aesthetically pleasing,5
"/r/Cricket during internationals: our team sucks.. we are gonna lose

/r/Cricket during IPL : the other 7 teams suck...",6
Jeez that was a good shot. I mean really really good.,3
My boi Rahul just tryin to increase his own average at the inevitable cost of defeat.,-3
How can I get the team name next to my user name??,2
Kl is a T20 god,7
"Pooran, hetmyer, hope could bring West Indies back to their glory days. Loads of raw talent which could translate into quality by playing with other quality players in the IPL",6
Kl another 100*/65,3
Nice.,7
"Holy shit, shot of the day",5
KL Rahool to accelerate now. Well paced innings.,5
I think ..... Kings will win today,3
"Nicholas Pooran is the most talented proper batsman from West Indies in a very long time. Probably the best since Lara, it sucks he is not playing red ball cricket. But he should, he is too good not to.",2
This is the KL we are used to seeing,3
"Here it is, we are doomed. Mercy Lord Rahul!",1
People saying tuk tuk Rahul right now: ü§°,3
r/cricket brought KL back to life!!,2
Watch him accelerate and get 90 (60),3
Thakur is just bowling pies atm,1
"KANNUR LOKESH! Kannur Lokesh! 
Remember the name!",6
Shardhul stop those pies already,2
4s on this ground is makes a better viewing than 6s on Sharjah for me.,6
Please I want him to play 70 balls today,3
Another century on the cards for KL Rahul.,2
"KL: I really want to cement that #4 spot for the 2023 WC

Pooran: But t20 WC comes next year

KL: say no more",10
Imagine bowling length balls to Rahul lmao,3
KL to KXIP fans : Hun kush o haramio?!?!,2
The berserker armour is on..,3
That was the plan all along. Play a mature knock till 14-15 overs and then explode.,5
Why are they panning to Flemming every 3.6 seconds?,3
Lmao Fleming has had enough,4
"175-180 Easily

Then CSK will lose 2 early wickets and they will be playing catch up the whole match",10
üíØ loading,1
Dogamn.,1
KXIP needs 30 more than par to defend it with their shit bowling,1
Lmfao what is this field setup,3
Fucking classy stuff,3
Lol stfu about Rahul y‚Äôall,3
RIP TUK TUK memes,3
"Are you kidding, is this the guy who said he couldn't sleep at night during lockdown fearing he might lose his touch",7
KL always starts the IPL for KXIP with 200+ SR innings and start anchoring the innings after 4 matches because middle order is shit.,14
Rahul: FUCK R/CRICKET,4
And just like that he accelerated? Okay,10
My fucking God. I feel so lucky we have a guy of such quality playing for India.,10
Whatta shot,2
Daily Mark Nicolas appreciation comment ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§,8
Ah so this is the 20 Run over that's gonna cost CSK the game.,3
This is pure batting.,3
Time for r/Cricket to bash Shardul,5
Why do bowlers insist on bowling short lmao,2
considering CSKs batting form anything over 180 is virtually impossible for them to chase,4
"People keep fighting over samson vs pant.

Rahul is has got that spot in the pocket.",4
Rahul : Talk nah,7
Im scrolling desperately to shit on KL‚Äôs haters,7
Rahul is definitely the best at going from 1st to 6tj gear so quick,6
"People watching KL, here you fucking go",7
Here we go again,3
Thakur the great death bowler,10
Y‚Äôall happy now?,6
Surgical,4
Wait it's all class ?,7
Khiladi shot üòé,2
Class shot,1
LORD THAKUR ARRIVETH!!,4
Bowl a fuckin Yorker man,3
So KL is a shoo in for number 4 slot in the Indian ODI slot then.,2
Can't believe people on here called him agent KL,4
Rahul is the best IPL batsman since 2018,13
Rahul seeing ball like water melon.,3
Rohit sharma school of being aggressive after a fifty.,14
Fun fact: Dwayne Bravo had worse eco. figures in death than Shardul Thakurs for the last 3 years. Yet both of them are playing today ahead of Hazlewood and Tahir.,14
"Jai Veeru

Simon Garfunkel

Laurel hardy

KP SunnyG",5
It's not fun anymore to see CSK attack get trashed. It's boring af. They are without any energy,9
"Shradul ""Pie thrower"" Thakur",9
KL RAHUL IS A GEM OF A PLAYER. It's shame if he got discovered very late.,8
That was another boundary ball. Lucky Thakur!,2
Maxwell's still been a passenger for KXIP. Will he fire today? Otherwise who do they swap him out for?,3
is Kl's plan to get his first 50 off 40 balls and then his next 50 off 10 lol. the duality of man,4
"KL Rahul scores really pretty runs, should get a star for that. Dhawan on the other hand.... Shesh",2
Shardul is still an Indian team hopeful oh my,6
Phlegming has replaced all the chicks the tharki cameramen would zoom in on,7
r/cricket doesn't understand the concept of acceleration,28
"Dafuq is this sub, people switching their opinions so quick",7
KL seeing the ball like your mom's boobs,2
5 overs left with 130 already on the board. Now the batsmen can hit freely and all this because Rahul has anchored the innings,6
 And there are people who dont want KL opening,6
"This sub is way too reactionary. 3 matches ago people were like ""why is pooran even in the team"".",12
imagine scoring 130 and then the death overs start. CSK lmao,3
Where are the Captain Cool tactics now??,3
KL is so smooth man,3
[removed],9
4 minutes ago you all were criticizing Rahul what did he now just do for y'all  to appreciate him again.Damn I can smell a Tewatia right away.,11
"For someone who has followed ipl for the last 2-3 years, believe me. Punjab is shit without Rahul. Like literally more brittle than glass. Mayank only started playing well this year.",8
always a joy to see some deft touch in the middle of all that smashing. KLR special!,3
We can‚Äôt chase 150 why are Punjab trying to score 180,9
‚ÄúTuk Tuk Rahul‚Äù boys gone into hiding ü§´,6
"Rahul has to do this type of innings, not reliable enough beneath him.",7
"I'm not mad, just disappointed with the lack of depth.",5
"Rahul is going to go big now. Specially considering Chawla, Thakur or Bravo still have to bowl.",7
People should stop shitting on KL. He is clearly the best KXIP batsman in the current team.,9
"Thakur, Curran, chahar ,Bravo are shit at death....just want to see how Maxwell bats against them...he should be dropped if he fails here",3
Pack up boys,2
Didn't SK Yadav get out to a leg stump half volley?,1
Rahul's shots make me think maybe I'm not Asexual,10
Dhawan‚Äôs already lost his place in tests and will be a reserve opener in t20‚Äôs. Hes also 34. Needs to get back in form otherwise that ODI spot will come in danger too,9
KLR has so much class that he should start his own e-learning platform,3
I can smell a Tewatia now.Correct me if I am wrong.,3
"Gamezy ads of KL are much cooler than all B grade ads of Dream11, mycircle11, etc",1
Nehra stop gagging on cocks.,2
It frustrates me that ktk players get to play for sides where the fans rarely appreciate their efforts üòí Pandey at SRH and now KL here. Not to forget the whole quota conspiracy nonsense!,3
More of thakur please. Want to watch another KL hundred,6
"It's fine to anchor but going at 100 Sr for 30 balls is a bad innings of you get out at 30, KL needs to score faster during the first half or it'll cost Punjab",2
Waseem Jaffer is KX batting coach. Great batsman but an odd choice for t20 side,10
Imagine Rohit and Rahul building a T20 innings for India and India 60/0 in 10 overs,7
"It's weird, it feels like csk has no strike bowler.",6
Is wasim the biggest talent that never made it for India?,6
Fuck I want more dopamine Rahul,3
KL has either timed his run to perfection or eaten too many balls and fucked KXIP.,8
"Wow, haven't seen Wasim Jaffer in a long time.",9
A superb pitch to bat on lol,8
Indian test team would like an opener like Wasim jaffar who was very good at playing swing,5
KL Rahul's batting is a perfect combination of class and power.,9
A break coming up after that six,7
Woahhh Wasim Jaffer changed a lot. I remember him being kinda skinny during his playing days.,9
Holy fuck that was massive. Pooran absolutely cunted that.,6
That was almost 10 Sharjahs,30
he yeeted that out of there,8
KXIP should declare now to keep the match fair,9
I forgot what WJ even looked like,8
"We have ngidi and hazelwood sitting in a bench. Feels bad

No death bowler this match",11
Jaffer admitting Punjab‚Äôs shit bowling,11
Nicholas Pooran hits some bloody beautiful sixes.,11
"Wasim "" he's a quality player"" Jaffer.",10
Jaffer is a name I haven't heard in a long long time,6
Rhodes is amused,4
Caribbean swag,8
Why are we here? Just to suffer?,5
Yep. CSK has lost this one too. They aren‚Äôt chasing anything close to 180 and Punjab are getting that minimum,6
CSK to remain at the bottom of the table,1
"What switched faster

KL Rahul's batting approach

Or this sub's opinion about him",39
"Man I feel for jaffer, he was a legend in first class games, his only fault was that of being playing in the wrong era..",16
He's swinging at everything,13
"Pooran is easily one the most talented batsman in the world, WI really should have him in the test side just on his pure ability.",16
KXIP is looking anywhere b/w 180-190 at this point,3
"Wasim Jaffer is the batting coach of Kings XI. 

Incoming, KL double century before a declaration at 630/6.",54
Huuuuugge that is huuuuge !,10
"Rahul and mayank are so good at accelerating at the end

Solid partership with one of them carrying on

Mandeep and pooran to run hard and bat at 150 strike rate. The odd big innings. 

Maxwell to finish

Sarfaraz to hit couple scoops and reverse scoops

Might be counting my chickens before they hatch, i hope Chris Jordan becomes our ace death bowler and we might be sorted as a team.",28
That SG signature bat is a classic,3
Faf wants to change franchise for sure,17
It's so refreshing to hear Mark Nicholas voice during the on field chats with the staff. Nice change up from the likes of Nehra ji and Chopra saab sucking Dhoni's dicks.,3
Wtf Jadhav.,10
They just need to get a replacement for Maxi and they are good. Probably get Ferguson into KXIP.,2
*imagine KL Rahul declaring after 17 overs saying that they have scored enough. CSK would shit on themselves*,66
Why is that useless fuck Jadhav getting pissed ?,24
What's Jadhav so pissed about?,15
Jadhav giving his sermon on the Boundary,4
Jadhav gets grumpy very fast,6
JAdhav with that weakass throw,10
Jadhav be like- I didn't want to play anyways,13
"if we reach 170, I would normally say we're safe against csk, but we'll find a way to get Tewatia-ed",5
[deleted],-4
Bitch throw,7
CSK applying for senior citizen discount. You get 10% off the target,64
"lol Jadhav, I can't believe he was a India player for some years",9
Set for 200+,2
Is there any bowler who has performed well with headband,2
There seems to be a lot of discord within the CSK squad,4
CSK players should start with clean shave to knock down average playing XI age by a year or two .,4
Csks chasing capacity is 165-170? Get 190 and you are set,2
Absolute carnage coming up after 2:30 minutes,3
Time for timeout,1
KL be ready to face the criticism  if you get out under 70 runs.,5
Shut up mark,1
"I feel today‚Äôs team is alright except Maxwell, we should have Gayle instead of him and this is a match winning team",3
"*Neem ka patta kadwa hain*

*Shardul Thakur bhadwa hain*

T: The leaves of the Azadirachta indica are bitter & limp,

Shardul Thakur is a dirty pimp!",29
Kedhar is annoyed that Sam Curran wanted him to throw the ball at his end.,3
"Kxip should just declare now, we have scored enough for csk",7
Kedar Jadhav looks like Troopz from AFTV,3
"Vijay Shankar : 3D
Rayudu : 2D
Jadhav : 0D",7
Krumble and Geoffrey out in the middle,2
That's an insane run rate considering Rahul was 47(46) at a point,6
Pretty sure Curran thinks that he's in the wrong team,6
Is it political reason why Imran tahir not playing?,-3
"Honestly when Jaffer was asked the qn about efforts not being rewarded, i thought he was talking about Jaffer's personal career.",8
Jhadav needs to be kicked out. If he ever wanted to suicide he should jump from his Ego level to his Skill level.,5
"If 170 is par, Punjab should be aiming for 195+",7
Jadhav is so puny,1
KXIP using CSK's own batting game plan against them and doing it better: One batsmen (usually Faf) controls the innings with a mature knock while others around him try to hit and then in the last 4-5 overs they try to go big.,6
That RCB add is so bad üò≠,2
The fake crowd is getting really good at cheering.,10
Given how CSK's performing I doubt they would be able to chase anything above 160,3
The gamble with KL Rahu soaking up this many balls is that you might get a 132\* off 69 or 69 off 54.,7
CSK playing with Jadhav in the XI is just then trying to beat the game on ultra hard difficulty.,6
I think 195 is more daunting than 205 psychologically,10
"Let's complete the list of worst commentators

1. Sehwag",5
"This sub is shitting on ma boy Jadhav so much, i suspect in some time he's gonna come to the party.",3
Calm before the storm,3
If Tahir takes a wicket and starts on his run he'll get heat stroke and pass out.,8
Every team fan following the reverse-jinxing strategy and shitting on the team they support. Noice,7
"60 off the last 4? With Lord Thakur, I am hopeful",9
"I am thinking about studies while watching the game wishing that some cool cricketer comes in to say, *""Padhai main kar leta hoon, aap Dream11 pe team banao...""*

Trans: I study, you make team.",10
Jhadhav as Marathi hates CSK as he doesn't wanna report to a Bihari,17
That CSK dressing room is not happy,2
"KL' s innings is either a curse or a blessing 

Blessing if he scores 100 and plays quickly on the last balls and stays till the end.

Curse if he doesn't accelerate and gets out quickly and consumes so much balls and gets out after settling.",5
Do these Indian IPL players bulk-order their bicep tattoos from the same artist!? Everyone got one!,4
Useless info: In dream11 ads both Pant and Dhoni are wearing the same design slippers,6
"Fun story

I bought a cricket magazine in Manali circa 2010

They usually had posters of one of the players, and this edition had a poster of Kedar Jhadhav, he hit a 50 vs RCB on debut",7
"No troll, but Dhoni‚Äôs test retirement in 2014 was kind of a knee jerk reaction. For all the criticism he has faced since late 2015 for his odi batting, he would have made an excellent test wicketkeeper batsman.",7

My sadistic ass is enjoying this desperation of CSK.,12
"Lol I feel for Curran, Faf, Josh and the other younger Indian players. 90% of this CSK side has a toxic boomer feel to it.",10
Why is Dhenier playing aging players who cant field and run and stuff very fast? :),7

Can somebody tell me why Jadhav is in the deep with that kind of a throw,3
"Next three overs, all are gonna be big",2
Just a thought/conspiracy: Maybe Fleming is more upset/expressive today because he may have wanted to change the lineup but Dhoni and others chose to keep the lineup and that's why he's being very critical of any mistakes these guys are making? Seems logical tbh.,8
Wish Dream11 had a chat option so I could yell at the idiots who pick Shardul in their team.,9
D Dhenier D Dhenier Dhenier,3
Look at their strike rates.,3
My boy Rahul not getting any strike. Has decent chance of getting another hundred.,5
Didn't Dhobi rose to fame for his decision to drop senior players in Indian team?,4
EVERY. SINGLE. CSK. MATCH. IS. PAINFUL. TO. WATCH.,6
"**CSK have conceded runs at the lowest economy rate in the death overs in IPL2020**

CSK - 10.30

DC -10.65

MI - 10.75

KKR - 10.84

RR - 11.16

SRH - 11.53

RCB - 13.35

KXIP - 15.18",6
MSD should take a leaf out of Bradman's book and send the players out in reverse order of batting today.,6
"Thakur ""tonking"" time",1
Smile on MSbigD face is assuring,4
When will test teams got coloured jersey,3
This over will go for 17,1
Spray and pray Thakur is here,3
There are two types of people in r/cricket . One who loves Bravo's bowling and  another one who just want the batsman to cunt him out of the park. Lol,13
"Some person on Cricbuzz reckons KXIP needs approx 190 runs to beat CSK. Has he/she not seen their previous 3 games. The way CSK is playing currently, you just need to play them to win against them",16
Jeez... pooran is left handed AB D,10
Shardul is a good looking man,8
Kl played literally 8.3 overs and more than the team and scored less then the team.,8
Wtf LORD THAKUR?,9
sir jadeja,3
Shardul in death kill me ready,5
Wottt,1
Aw man.... He hit it well.,1
oye jaddu!!!,5
Pooran what a golf swing,3
[deleted],2
Great catch,4
sir jadeja (‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ†),9
"Tough catch, that was in space",5
Jaddu not dropping it tonight. But fucking hell that was high.,9
Excellent catch.,3
Would hate for Rahul to get criticism after this innings. He‚Äôs provided the assurance needed for other batsmen to go big,8
My god that was hit with all the power in the world.,10
"Lord thakur, take my kids",6
That catch was as good as it gets.,6
cameraman be like: ‡≤†‚Äø‡≤†,9
I won't celebrate early. Lets look for a no ball,3
"Shit, that‚Äôs a very difficult catch to take!!",5
Great catch but god he hit that so high,9
"This IPL going great for all Rahuls - KL, Tewatita, Tripathi",5
Would have gone out of the stadium at Sharjah,5
This was the shot he was tryna play in the super over v DC,6
oh shit,2
That‚Äôs a 12 in sharjah,25
Anyone who actually believed that fielding argument is high lol,0
LMAOO viji called it a six :D,2
"""That had icicles on it by the time it came down""     

I love Pommie so much.",18
That catch was harder then he made it look,7
Can‚Äôt wait for Maxwell to mess this whole shit up,7
Very high that was. Not sure if anybody other than Jadeja would have taken it.,13
Fuck them Maxwell,2
Oof! That sailed close to orbit and came back. Fantastic catch and I think only Jaddu can pull this off in this team,9
Well played Chooran! Up to Maxwell now,6
Specialist Fielder‚Ñ¢,10
Rahul needs to activate his mode that he did against rcb,11
just as we get going ):,8
"**17.1** Thakur to Pooran, OUT, **very very high again**  but not far enough. This is a good catch from Jadeja at deep midwicket. **152-3**

N Pooran c Jadeja b Thakur 33 (17b 1x4 3x6) SR: 194.11",4
That looked like a six 99% of the time,3
The aim here is to achieve better NRR than half of the teams even if CSK ends this season at the bottom of the table. Doable.,3
Thank fuck that went to Jadeja. Faf got butter fingers today.,6
Maxwell about to smash singles with a strike rate of 50,6
Playüëèyourüëènaturalüëègameüëèmaxwellüëè,5
I mean it's not like CSK are scoring 150 anyway,5
man am I dumb to say pooran lost that spirit to attack after he had fun talk with bravo?,1
17 balls to go. KXIP should at least 35 from these. Anything under 185 will be disappointing.,2
He got out but holy fuck pooran can hit.,2
KXIP made some smart.moves today sending Mandeep and pooran ahead of maxwell and picking up Jordan as a death bowler.. good selection backed up by good performances,2
Makhanwala time,1
Maxwell can fix his spot for next match if he huts four sixes today,1
Come on Maxi do *something*,2
"Maxwell, Sarfaraz to come, no hope.

KL should face most of these 17 balls",2
Meh-xwell out to the crease now,3
Send in Jordan and not Maxwell please,1
What the fucker is that lenskart ad! Should had made an ad where Pollard using their contact lenses helped him to perform better and the results shows.,2
Who's 'Scraff'?,2
[deleted],5
Wtf Rahul,6
[deleted],3
Bro wtf....,2
What a shit inning,3
Lord Thakur 2 in 2 TF,3
Lord thakur fuck my wife already,2
Another player mended to form by this glorious sub,3
"Nehra in dugout: Replace curran with murali vijay.

Guys am done",5
"Fuck all, Thakur bowls well again.",2
Meme time lord thakur good god,3
"Kings 11 Punjab fans be like:
The leaves of the Azadirachta indica are bitter & limp,

Shardul Thakur is a dirty pimp!",5
How the fuck have shithouses like Shardul and Chawla taken big fishes like KL and Mayank?,1
"Idk why most of other team fanbase hate CSK.

Let me guess is it due to your team not making to qualifying round each season?

Jealous coz csk was so good for this many years?

Maybe csk is not good this year but it's just 1 season out of 13 seasons.

Edit : I know this comment going to get lot of downvotes. But that just means what I stated was right.",-14
LORD THAKUR DOES IT AGAIN,5
CSK doing CSK things now finally,5
Lord on hatrick... Just CSK things,5
Balaji u rock man üòÇ,3
"I understand they need aggression, but Pooran needs to work on temperament. Without temperament he won't be elite.",5
So Kl rahul coudnt accelerate,1
is it only me who hates that lenskart ad? my man Pollard runs all the way from 30 yards to chase the ball and they do him dirty like that,5
KL should just retire from cricket rn. How tf do you lose your wicket to Shardul of all people?,-2
Wtf rahul,2
O Lord Thakur pardon me for my sins,12
Shardul tonking everyone. How the turn tables.,2
Bhak bc nazar lag gaya,2
I don't feel so good,3
Bruh CSK can still chase down a target today,3
Sorry lord shardul. Spoke too soon,3
The Lord strikes again. I guess I jinxed this :),3
What was KL thinking? FFS,3
I expected this to be a high scoring over,4
Oh noes :(,3
"Thakur on a hat-trick. 2020, how much more?",8
This is why gotta score faster earlier,3
Lmao Thakur taking two wickets. Making the Sharduls proud,2
"MSD is a genius, there‚Äôs no other explanation for how he repeatedly does this.",10
Stephen Fleming looks like Murr of Impractical Jokers. And today has been giving exasperated expressions like him.,1
Commentary praising Dhoni again,2
The RCB in the RCB lite showing it's characteristic now,3
"**17.2** Thakur to Rahul, OUT, **taken by Dhoni to his right!** Thakur will be on a hat-trick. **152-4**

KL Rahul c &dagger;Dhoni b Thakur 63 (52b 7x4 1x6) SR: 121.15",1
[deleted],9
how do you get out off such a crap delivery,1
Shardul taking all the curse from r/cricket and converting them to wickets,10
r/cricket trolling does its magic again,5
"Thakur, of all people",2
LORD!,3
How good is MSD in strategy and executing with his bowlers and trusted fielders?,4
How does bitch bowl like fucking Glenn McGrath when he plays for CSK and bowls like Azharullah when he plays for India?,11
Collapse,3
"What game will be a better watch? 

Man City v Leeds United last night or Man Utd v Tottenham tonight?",1
Okay maxwell and sarfu need to smack thakur for revenge,4
Can‚Äôt wait for 5(15) from Maxi now,1
"Yes dhoni sets the plan and shardul thakur follows, hence the wickets.",2
Two quick wickets by KXIP. Is this the mini-collapse that brings CSK back into this match?,2
Wtf is happening lord thakur on a hattrick!!,2
WHAT WAS THE PLAN???,10
"""What a plan he has set""

Is everything a masterplan by Dhoni? Can the commentators stop sucking him off for once?",12
"3 overs to Chahar, Curran, Bravo. What does MSD do? Throw the ball to Lord Thakur, who‚Äôs now taken out KL and Pooran",8
[removed],7
Thakur is that you?üëÄ,2
"This is why people were criticising KL. Eating up so many balls and then try to hit towards the end won't always work. And when it doesn't, he looks selfish.",3
Sarfaraz on strike the hattrick is possible,4
Whats the par score here?,1
Off topic but if rr plays unadkat next match I will jump off the roof,3
Fucker celebrated like his career depended on the wicket,10
About what plan are these commentators talking about??,2
Yeh hatrick mujhe dedhe THAKUR!,4
maxwell and Sarfaraz better not go and hit 10 off 20 each,8
"Alright Punjab. 16 balls remaining, score  18 runs. Take it to 170 atleast. Don't fuck up",8
"Thakur joins the ""FU r/cricket"" brigade.",10
"Don't let Kedar Jadhav's recent form fool you, his record speaks for itself. 
4 fifties in 83 games at a superb strike rate of 112 is nothing to sneeze at and more than makes up for his trash fielding and non existent running between the wickets.",13
Shardul type of players can only perform for Dhoni,5
[deleted],2
Dhoni is the definition of form is temporary class is permanent,8
What was this master plan lol,4
thicc boy Sarfaraz walks in.,3
This is why you need to have a high SR once you've faced a certain number of balls. You can't face 9 overs making 63 runs with a weak bowling line up on good batting tracks.,4
100th IPL catch for MS Dhoni.,7
"ohhh yeah, after 3 losses, they had to come back against us... Script writers, have mercy on KXIP once.",7
"Every bowler has tried to bowl full and wide every match, Mumbai bowlers were bowling every ball full and wide. But no, what a great discovery and plan by Dhoni. The commentary is getting unwatchable",14
"How tf is this Dhoni‚Äôs plan, it‚Äôs just good bowing",18
"How is that fucking following a plan? Wide half volley, didn‚Äôt execute it properly. Barring Ian Bishop and Simon Doull the commentary has been dreadful",10
Inb4 Cricinfo gives Rahul's innings -50 impact score before taking into account KXIP's team dynamic.,7
[deleted],3
My balls were in my mouth for .2 seconds.,4
almost had a hat trick.,9
Only if it carried...,2
Holy shit that was so close,3
More on r/Cricket daily: Shardul Thakur almost pulls off a hattrick after coming under heavy fire from the sub.,8
Whatever thakur does it still pains that he couldn‚Äôt score a single off the last ball in the 2019 final.. what a shame..,10
Wtf is happening?,3
Come on guys atleast get us to 170,5
Lord Thakur: fuck you r/cricket,10
I wanted Shardul to get a hat-trick :(,3
"If Taxi doesn't get going, imma steal his fianc√©e",8
"Memes aside, amazing bowling from Shardul at the death.",8
if Sarfaraz had got out we may as well quit playing. A Thakur hattrick is peak 2020,1
Oh that was so close.. Thakur on hatrick..,1
Shardul McGrath,5
170 is too much for csk,3
It must suck playing for CSK. Any good performance is attributed to Dhoni,13
"Earlier I said KL Rahul had either timed his run to perfection or eaten too many balls and fucked KXIP, NOT LOOKING GOOD KL MY OLD MATIE!",3
Arey maxwell kukka esaari aina aadura,1
Bhaag sarfu!,1
"Here's hoping Vijay fucks Jadhav's wife,so that they can have a big fight and jadhav ends a getting a divorce and going back to India",1
Guys declare...give Csk a chance,3
Who said CSK doesn't give chance to youngsters? Look at Lord Thakur,6
"When the person makes his dream11 team after a cricketer says, ""yeh main karleta hu....."" What happens afterwards? Do they just stare at each other?",10
Sarfaraz gonna try a couple scoops before getting out like always,5
LORD SHARDUL,5
The useless dumbass jadhav has no right to get pissed at that,7
"Glenn ""I hit a hundred mate"" Maxwell",11
Except for that one match for RCB. I've never seen Sarfraz khan play well.,1
Send in Jordan ffs he‚Äôs much better than these 2,8
Thakur is actually a decent death bowler,7
When was the last time Sarfaraz played a good innings 2015 ?,8
Yo Dhoni enjoyed that catch. Good to see the excitement on his face :),13
What an over,2
"Excellent over, well bowled.",3
"Wide of off Knick to keeper.

Indians in this thread - WhAT a TActICuL geNIuS, HOw doES he dO it, WW2 wOUld havE beInG ovER in DAys if kINg DhonI wAS in CHArGe...",0
"Punjab were on their way to 190, what an over by Thakur",3
Lord Thakur another player to be bullied into playing well,8
"3 runs, 2 wickets in 18th over. Stranger things have happened",6
Shardul bowling excellent at death wtf is this timeline,3
"Guys, those of you who are watching on Hotstar and can understand Bengali, switch to the Bengali commentary. The way they are tearing into most players is HILARIOUS!",6
At what point does Maxwell go back to his previous batting stance?,3
"Worth its weight in gold, that over by Lord Thakur. Punjab will score at least 20 fewer runs now.",3
3 runs over. Unacademy Game Changer moment right there!,4
"If we get to 170, with Jordan in today, we might have a chance",3
Lusty blows,1
[deleted],15
BC only 3 runs off Thakur over at Death?!!? 2020 is really a fucked up year.,4
Seriously Jadhav throws worse than Under 15 kids.,4
"Never switching from Tamil commentary ever again - this is not Maxwell this season, he is Max-not-well xD",39
Does Mandy bowl anymore? Asking for Fantasy team purposes,6
Thakur to compensate for this when he is inevitably given the ball in 20th over,2
All this while I was thinking Chahar will bowl the 20th over,3
Jadhav throws like a 5 year old!,3
"A bit of context - Rahul said after the last game in the post match interview(his team had lost their 3rd game in 4 matches) that ""Mayank has worked hard and deserves the orange cap. I'm sure I'll take it off him soon.""


Did that today. Got the orange cap. You can judge if a captain should really be making that statement in the post match interview and the way he batted today",0
KL Rahul and David Warner are being more harmful than helpful to their teams by playing overly cautiously.,4
"Sunny G sucking Brohit
Nehraji sucking Thala
‡≤†_ ñ‡≤†",10
That was a intentional mis field to keep Sarfaraz on strike.,7
Maxwell really had one amazing season and has been utter shit ever since in the ipl,10
It‚Äôs genuinely frustrating watching Sarfaraz bat and going only for scoops,7
"It was 3 runs easily, Sarfraz!",3
sarfaraz running 1s and 2s. rip.,4
"I thought Sarfaraz had lost weight, looks like he's become golu once again",6
Long way to go but Shardul is moving on the right side of Dinda - Bumrah scale.,7
Just had a flashback of RCB 2008 while seeing Chawla field.,7
Can't believe sarfaraz was one of the 3 players retained by RCB instead of Gayle in the mega auction...,6
Dwayne lee,2
Can't push for 3 with that paunch hanging down Sarfu,3
Sarfraz takes double the number of strides to complete a single than pollard takes to complete a double.,3
Sarfraz is such a heckin chonker,1
"KL just fucked up big time by scoring  63 off 52 this inning is just unacceptable.Reddit will now hate him for the day.Bitch just wasted 9 overs and fucked up KXIP,earlier I thought  we were going to win but with his 120 strike rate he fucked up straight,now his captaincy will fuck things more,Bailey was the best captain for KXIP no doubt!!",6
Sarfaraz stop eating those burgers man..there were 3 runs there,10
CSK fumbles more than Giants,6
CSK pulled it back in the last couple of overs,8
[removed],8
This is an epic comeback at the death here,3
Jaadiya wo yorker ball pe girne waala tha.,2
"I don‚Äôt want to lose today, I can‚Äôt take it anymore",2
Sarfaraz could have taken the extra run had he rolled.,4
Sarfaraz and Maxwell well on course to suck the momentum off KXIP's batting,2
"Looking at this shitshow, I am glad KL played cautiously",3
Watch the CSK openers bat as though Jeff Thompson and Curtly Ambrose are opening the bowling.,9
Big off season for safaraz by the looks of it.,2
Man gotta capitalize on the momentum that Pooran gave. They should be getting a great 180 total here,3
Why does Sarafaraz still get selected? smh,5
Yeah Maxwell usually fucks us.,6
this is just atrocious death batting from kxip. shiiiiite.,7
Sarfaraz looks like a chunky cum. Lol,4
Great running sarfi boi,2
So Kaptan's magic worked finally,1
Wtf is Maxwell batting stance?,3
Lol Akash Chopra saying that he played with a strike rate of 70,3
Good Yorkers.... credit where it's due....,6
Fine fucking ly,0
"This is why KL has to bat like he did, absolute joke of a team.",2
hell of a comeback by the Dheniers,2
Shit vs Shit,-1
"Now that the fat ass is batting,I have no hope left for even a 170, CSK is gonna fuckin destroy us tonight, we will feel Dhoni's wrath today.",6
Fuck you all no one plays like Maxwell,6
"Everyone talks about Chonker Chawla , while Sarfaraz flies under the radar",5
"Punjab should target 180, with the dew expected to come in the later half",1
"I would get out 100 times out of 100, but Maxi gets a 4 on that. smh",2
Maxwell played a lot of gully cricket seems like,7
Chennai lost their last match chasing 164.,7
"Needed a boundary, someone needs to absolutely slog the last over and Maxwell is the only one who looks like he can",1
IF MSD can't adjust his pupils in night games what will happen to him in afternoon matches?,3
Maxwell is still my boy!,4
Wtf you guys care so much about what commentators say about dhoni?like it is difficult to play for CSK because you dont get credit. We are listening to commentary not players. I believe dhoni doesnt go around dressing room saying you did well because of me.,4
Maxwell has no role in this batting line up now. Why is he still in the squad is beyond me. 6 years he's fooling everyone.,5
How fast was that throw. Sir Jaddu,1
Soo much cardio for Sarfraz,3
KL innings may help CSK here,1
Intentional slow throw by Jadeja to have Sarfaraz on strike next ball.,1
Bois we have lost the match. Score is Over 160.,2
"The last over needs to be big, come on Maxi",1
[removed],2
Sarfraz 100% got sandpapered there,3
"160 seems an appropriate chase, just don't Fuck up!",1
Sarfaraz ka 5kg vajan kam ho gaya. All these doubles.,1
Why struggle so much to give strike to Sarfaraz,1
Are kxip running well or are csk fielding badly?,1
Maxwell giving off strong gully cricket vibes,3
Maxwell will make Sarfaraz fit enough to take the bleep test by making him run like a madman.,6
Good guy csk helping maxi get his funk back,2
I‚Äôd love to see Maxi and Kohli batting together. The running üòçüòç,1
"Why you Punjab fans are worrying so much? Honestly, we are RCB of this season.. don't you worry",9
"Too many changes inducing predictability in bravo's bowling. The batsman knew he won't bowl two yorkers back to back. 
40D chess",2
[deleted],4
I refuse to believe Sarfraz is 22. He looks like a darker version Piyush Chawla with that belly sticking out.,7
This looks like a proper match between the two bottom placed teams.,4
When was the last time Maxwell played a match winning innings? 2015?,5
"I say this is a 15 run over, come at me",3
Lol,1
What was that,1
"bravo bowls 18th over
Nehraji: tactical masterclass from thala",3
Scoop^TM,5
Pls cunt thakur,2
Shardul and not Chahar? Screwed,3
Sarfaraz doing sarfaraz things,2
"OK I know he bowled a great third over, but Chahar and Curran both have overs left, why not give the ball to them?",1
Sarfaraz just used up all his variety of shots after that ball,3
How the hell did he play that,1
This is not going to be easy for us. Kxip's bowling has been good & the less I say about our batting the better,2
Abd lite,1
"Of course MS Dhoni was prepared for that, how could he not.",4
That was inventive,1
LOL! I can't believe people are shitting on KL who played a decent game with 120 SR. Sometimes you need to build the innings and don't have to go bang bang in every game!,7
Sarf knows his ramps. Cleverly redirected,3
Just keep 2 fielders behind Sarfara6,1
Man when Sarfraz is batting I would keep 11 fielders behind him and he still will hit there.,6
Sarfu scoop >> Buttler scoop,4
"Love him or hate him, little tubby is pretty good when he plays that shot.",3
He did it boys that's what we've been waiting for,1
Sarfaraz lets go!,1
"If this reaches the last 5 overs of CSK innings, it'll be an interesting contest between a team that can't bowl at death vs a team that can't hit at death. Let's see who's worse",5
Nice shot,1
"Man, we need one brilliant innings or spell for CSK. That will lift the mood in the camp and bring back the confidence. 

Like Bollinger did in 2010",2
"Sarfaraz appears to be powered by Biryani, possibly too much of it.",6
I swear to god he gets all his boundaries like this,3
Telugu commentary: ‚Äúsarfaraz back to his theda batting‚Äù,7
Whats the use of all that thiccness if the only way you can score a boundary is by a cute lil scoop?,3
I remember there were days when commentator Nasser Hussain called out Indian team donkey for lethargic fielding in T20 in England,3
"Aight, I gotta ask this. I mean no hate or anything but is bravo really THAT good of a death bowler? Sure, he bowls some good overs in clutch moments at times, but I feel like most of the time his economy is closer to 10...",7
Sarfaz practising his jalebi frying skills accidentally hits 4 .,10
Sarfaraz would never be able to play ipl if runs behind wickets weren't allowed,15
Awesome batting fatty.,1
Thakur high on bc mc,2
Chubby boi is sweetly placing the balls,8
Sab chungusi for KXIP and sarfaraz,5
Sarfraz contorting his chonky body to play that shot is just perfection,8
That was clever from Sarfaraz tbh.,6
Can Sarfaraz any other shots??,2
Thats how you play a yorker,2
That was actually a good ball,2
"As the legend goes , ""Thakur taketh, Thakur giveth"".",7
Now praise the captaincy,5
"Shardul vs Sarfaraz, the battle of mediocrity",7
Shardul McGrath to Shardul Vinay Kumar,5
Petition to have Chawla bowl to Sarfaraz and Rohit with Pant keeping,10
"For Sarfaraz, it's no brainer to have a 3'rd man. Even a keyboard warrior knows this.",7
Cheeky sarfaraz,2
Sarfaraz actually has a FC average of 66,5
Why Chahar is not completing his 4 overs? Did something happened to him?,4
That didn't look wide,2
Lord chubby taking revenge!,4
Sarfaraz stretched more than he ever did chasing for that wide,3
I think that was a dot ball,2
How tf was that wide? It was inside the wide line. Wow.,1
Now all those who complained about Sarfu's batting..lol,3
RIP Sarfraz's wife's ass,3
That' was not a wide man,3
Mini Maxwell:- Yaha sab same hai ye apna game hai,1
Take DRS for wide..wtf umpire,8

"After that Maxwell scoop try, it's proven Sarfaraz > Maxwell",3
Sarfaraz deserves to be given a solid chance to perform. Treating him as a lowly pinch hitter is massively unfair.,5
Oh boy..Sarfaraz you cutie..putting all the burger energy in that single,4
How many matches since maxi crossed 30?,3
"Cmon Maxy, you aint no Sarfaraz",5
Maxwell missing a scoop while Sarfaraz nails them is peak 2020,7
Awful by maxwel,1

what was that maxwell lmao,4
Why is a telly tubby batting?,6
Maxwell can't even display anger properly. Catch that bat,8
"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CF7HaYnFQuF/?igshid=kjb9p1bv7vo6

Lmfao",14
Maxwell dude you are in the last over,2
Just drop maxwell. He's useless,5
Sarfaraz still looks like AB beta version. Good player but borrowed too much he almost looks AB's parody lol,6
It's much more than enough for CSK,3
Good comeback after 152/2 in 17 overs,11
Maxwell didn't hit a full toss.,4
Ma boy Thakur does well again,20
Glenn Maxwell's new stance is terrible.,24
Maxwell couldn't even catch the bat after throwing it up. Very disappointing performance by him again,31
Classy 11(7) from maxi ‡≤†_‡≤†,9
Actually decent score especially given that CSK has not been in peek form as of late,11
11(7) Maxwell is not Maxwell,12
I was expecting a big IPL from Maxwell after that England tour :/,11
Fighting total. Should be an interesting chase,2
"Hippity hoppity, we won't score more than 170 - CSK",7
dhoni looks like he wants to scream. the dilli pleasantries,8
wtf why didn't they try for two?,2
Great finish by csk here,3
Lmao Maxwell trying reverse scoop again when he could have scored some by hitting along the ground. Has he connected anything while playing a reverse scoop this year?,9
Terrible finish by KXIP but no way CSK is gonna chase this lol. Anything above 150-160 is impossible for this team.,5
12 run last over is good actually,3
Ok my money on CSK given Punjab‚Äôs bowling,3
What's the par score on this pitch?,3
Maxwell is wasting an overseas spot,13
any other team could chase this. not csk tho,3
I was hoping for at least 185 tbh,3
4-0-39-2 is a classic Shardul Thakur spell.,5
My money is on Watto tonight.,1
If Maxwell shaved his head would he look like Johnny Sins ?,5
Sarfaraz getting angry as if he expected more from himself,7
Sarfaraz Khan is a nice guy. He donated food packets to migrant workers during lockdown,14
I wish maxi does a 2014 :(,2
I think if Maxwell changes his stance he may actually start performing to some extent again,3
"Csk bowled well, but they didn't bowl well?",3
CSK should open with Hussey and Fleming.,11
These two teams look genuine wooden spoon contenders.,5
"Make ppl believe their chasing is not good enough so opponents aim to score less runs only which they‚Äôll then chase, 8D chess right there",1
KXIP the kinda team to make Tewatia and Thakur look world class players,4
CSK to score a 170/5,10
My spidey senses are tingling ... tonight is the night for Watson.,8
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ejfuxr8VcAAzrNb.jpg,3
"Indians used to love Maxwell before he got married to an Indian girl üòÇ
is that off limits?",5
Only time will tell whether KL played a useful/useless knock today,5
No matter what the target is CSK will make the required run rate 22+ for the last 5 overs.,21
[removed],4
"Feels for Punjab, reduced their winning margin from 30 to around 10",7
[deleted],5
"On a positive note, I'm sure CSK can chase this down before the second new ball comes into play.",7
I know he went for a couple of boundaries but excellent from thakur,3
CSK should open with Hayden.,9
Still a pretty decent total considering KXIP good bowling line-up and shitty CSK batting top order. Punjab pretty much still in the game.,2
https://twitter.com/baluswetha96/status/1312780452856381442,4
Maxwell should bat at 3. His talent is wasted at 5,5
Sarfaraz walking off the pitch completely exhausted after batting for 15 long minutes.,36
Predict Jhadav's score : 11(15),7
Maxwell so dedicated to his wife that he won't score any runs against Indian bowlers.,6
Have a feeling Punjab will win this,10
The Curran opening as a pinch hitter experiment must begin today,11
Shit IX punjab vs Chennai super shits.,11
Good decision by kl Rahul to play safe instead of depending on his middle order,6
Either bat him at 3 or stop paying millions for him,6
"Just bring in Gayle for Maxi at this point, he can even bowl 1-2 overs if needed",15
48 off last 5,4
Should we replace Sarfraz? Good batsman but quite unfit .,2
Mandeep speaks well,3
"Pitch seems kinda slow, we're in for disappointment again bois",2
NRR chasing predictions? Mine: CSK need 60 off 12 balls and then hit 6 sixes. Quantum of loss reduced successfully.,14
Can we open with Mike hussey.?,13
Story of KXIP this season. They play exceptionally well for 90% of the match and botch the remaining 10%. I hope this target is OK for them to defend.,14
CSK to score 173/6,11
"The last time Maxwell got a 50 in IPL was 2016, and the last time he got 2 50s in a season was 2014. Baffling how you can rake in the dough while being so shit.",18
Maxwell was paid 11 crores guys he can't just be benched,15
If KXIP win this they will go to the 4th spot. If CSK win they will still only go up to number 7 unless they improve their NRR by a lot,8
"Not even trying to make fun of them. But CSK has old players and they played just Friday, this will be a hard score for them to chase. 

Their bodies need more rest.",5
They need to send Maxwell above Pooran and give him some time to settle. Pooran can be a finisher.,6
"Anyone else thinks csk players are in depression? Faf, bravo look sad like all the time.",19
[deleted],29
The target is irrelevant. CSK will need 70-80 from 30 balls towards the end.,25
Anyone explain - why would D Chahar not finish his overs?,6
maxi should bat at 3,6
"Kxip should now bring back Gayle here, maxi doesn't have it anymore for punjab",8
Two ipl coaches are Maxwell's fanbois. That's why he keeps getting traded between Delhi and Puniab for big sums,15
Still a good score. That Thakur over cost them 10-15 runs. Sarfaraz did well in the last over. There's only so much you can do.,3
"Final tally

**KL Rahul 63 (52)**

**Rest of the team 111 (68)**",8
"Wtf 1-2 already, just 16 minutes into the game.",-10
"Looking at that scorecard, I couldnt help but point my fingers at KL for his slow and carefully constructed 63 off 52. He scored some good runs but at what cost?",0
"179 to chase for CSK, this is going to be a loooong evening.",6
[deleted],3
How likely it is that punjab releases Maxwell next year,1
The bowling choices were weird today. Nevertheless Shardul bowled a brilliant 18th over.,1
Even after shardul took those wickets they were cocksucking dhoni!! If you give him all the credit. He'll be blamed for the losses too. You can't have the best of both worlds,6
I think Dhoni likes to play Watson and Jadhav so that the blame can be put on someone else instead of him.,5
Eagerly awaiting for Thala's 50-60 SR innings till 19th over,0
This is 50 runs too many for CSK's crippled batting order.,1
"So, relative newbie to cricket here. That being said, I really don‚Äôt understand the appeal of T20 other than the shorter match times. 

The bowlers seem to be at a huge disadvantage. Why is it in a 20 over match that you still have 10 wickets?

Makes it like a less strategic version of baseball.",4
Jadhav is so StreetSmart^TM that he belongs to Pune Streets only,13
Trade Gayle to us kxip,3
"Curran+Watson open, Faf at 3, Rayudu at 4, followed by Dhoni, Jadhav, Jadeja and Bravo. CSK needs to reshuffle the order a bit and they're a fantastic batting line-up.

Edit: Faf at 3.",0

Powerplay predictions 34-2,2
"How are we feeling about the batting order and the total boys??

I think we did great considering the 18th over. I wouldve backed pooran to hit that 6 and KL to get another 100 but u know what. It happens. 

Well done by Sarfaraz and Maxy given how many balls they had. Maxwell can chip in with couple overs to jaddu. Backing Jordan too. 

Also nice to see that Maxy gives a fuck at least, hes trying, it's not coming off but hes trying.",11
"*Dhoni waves his gloves once*

Star Sports : What a masterstroke by Dhoni.",42
Let me make a very bold prediction: CSK will need 70 from 20 balls towards the end with Thala at 7 runs from 14 balls,10
"Sometimes I don't understand , as soon as Jordan underperformed in the first match, everyone was like drop Jordan and replace Neesham, and first match Neesham underperformed, everyone again went drop Neesham and take Jordan. If teams worked this way, then the confidence of the player just takes a fucking hit.",6
"Holy Fuck. Jatin Sapru legitimately said ""Why must Dhoni contribute in every match, it's also the top order's responsibility"", ""Hoping Dhoni won't have to do everything by himself"". Top order is proper shit bar Faf so I'll give him that by why is he sucking up to MS so bad?",10
Commentators sucking Dhoni off like they used to do to Tendulkar. Kohli will be next.,9
IPL teams are named like how 11 year olds would name their fantasy sports teams,2
"Star sports still busy sucking off Thala.
Stop it ffs ¬Ø\_‡≤†_‡≤†_/¬Ø",17
"In the points table perspective, it would be good for us if CSK wins.

But there's no way in hell I'm gonna be rooting for that.",7
Ffs 20 runs short? see csk get 100 in 15 overs and 50 in another reminder 5 after match lost,6
"Chris Jordan & Yuvraj Singh, two guys who saved their best for their country",1
"CSK need to promote Curran up the order this game after Rayudu if they want to win this game. This score is gettable even if they don‚Äôt have a great start. But Jadhav, Dhoni, and Jaddu can‚Äôt come before him.",6
I'm glad that IPL filled in the drab 2020. More so because some of these players are as fresh and fit as the person having a drink on my couch.,8
"Just ate a plate full of *idiyappam*, my body is ready! 


We got this match folks!",9
"Today CSK shouldn't have any excuses. Respecting the dew, no no-ball issue today. Only problem to address is their strategy of playing watchful dots till 17th over lol.",5
All seven matches in Dubai were won by sides batting first (including two Super Over wins). The average 1st innings score was 177 in the seven games - KXIP scores 178.,9
Take out Watson and game is done,2
"King XI have a talented team they just can't seem to put it all together. Pooran just makes cameos, they bowl well to start but can't in death overs.",3
CSK are the best death bowling side!,4
"Really liked the way Mandeep played today. Even though he didn't score much, he looked confident against the spinners. Hope he scores big in further matches",10
"One of my noob friends has made Dhoni the captain in **Dream 11** for this match. Don't know, whether I should laugh at him or feel sorry for him.",7
"drop maxwell for gayle, sarfaraz for gowtham and maybe harpreet for ishan porell and we'll get XI that can actually play.",5
They don't even talk about sam curran being a big hitter. Just DHONI DHONI DHONI DHONI,8
160+ score means Dhoni works for the other team.,5
[deleted],11
"I must admit nothing is funnier, save RCB of past, than CSK needing some 90 off 30 odd balls with Dhoni taking it deep and then blasting when match is out of reach becoming top or second top scorer with a decent strike rate and r/cricket rage that follows.",7
"Another Great, responsible and vital batting by KL again",3
Today‚Äôs the day for Watson. He‚Äôs gonna take csk over the line. But there‚Äôs Shami.. oh! nevermind,6
KIXP idiots should've sent maxi ahead,3
[deleted],3
"Excited to see what Jordan does on this pitch today, also it was it birthday yesterday I think",3

Hope Watson should perform here,1
Watson looks depressed,2
csk will play for nrr or 2 pts?,1
Let the blame games begin!!,-1
How do y‚Äôall feel about Rahul coming in at 4 for Punjab(he has done it for India) and Gayle and Mayank opening to bring some stability to the middle order?,1
Watson looks depressed,3
"All I see is comments full of hate, hopefully you guys get some happiness in your life.",3
"Ahh, love it when even the CSK fans talk shit about CSK. 

Watto better batto well.",4
I feel like Faf is perfect for 3 and should stay there. Rayadu can open and we can go back to our 2018 combination!,6
I have a feeling that Dhoni is going shut up everyone's mouth today.,3
"CSK haven't chased a target as high as this since the start of last season of IPL. In 2018, though, they chased down two totals of 200-plus en route a title win.",5
Thala should open. Thala pussy,-2
KL not keeping today?,2
[Why are KXIP fielding 5 overseas players today ](https://youtu.be/OdVDRPRQWyk),8
I have a gut feeling that this gonna be CSK's comeback. Let's see,2
Watson seems ready. This should be interesting,1
Interesting to see Rahul isnt keeping. We are losing a slightly better fielder but maybe he believes his captaincy is affected by Keeping?,4
Kedhar and Dhoni in dressing room will be having an orgasm eating and thinking about NRR,3
"So, which players will be joining Thala Academy tonight?",2
Please Watto review one just for old times sake,4
Feels like Watson will fire today,5

Watson is easily the widest yet the fittest guy !,3
"Cricbuzz is def not holding back with their shots at CSK. love it.

""it's not that CSK have been great chasers this season, far from it, but at least this target will allow them to follow their template of taking it really deep. Or in simpler words, they won't look silly doing what they've been doing. The pitch looks quite good and with dew coming down, it won't be easy for KXIP. If only Chennai are to show intent. If only.

Cmon watson,1
"Bowlers bowling inswing delivery

Absolute scenes if CSK trolls r/cricket tonight.,2
Cottrell‚Äôs SR is only 7.9 despite that 30 run over,2

How about Curran gets 7 balls this innings instead of 6,8
"I have huge respect for Day 1 RCB fans now. 5 matches in, and I know CSK cant chase this one, despite looking possible on paper. Imagine the pain, pessimism and negativity those guys have been experiencing for 12 years",8

Good that rahul is not keeping. Less work to do in the field and can get involved much better.,4
Amazing how every player finds form vs us,8

Kings XI exists only to bring everyone back in form,7
"9 from the first over lads. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL.",9

Everyone somehow finds form vs us lmao. We are way worse than rcb,6

Shami getting so much movement goddamn,3
That'll help.,2
Yeah CSK are winning lol,3
Lmao first innings shami back at it. That was supposed to be the lbw ball,2

"Watto seems to be determined today, if he gets going no ground is big enough for him",6
"If rahul feels comfortable being in constant conversations with his bowlers, i hugely support his decision to not keep.",10
Watson looks intent,3
Every once in a while Shami undoes what he just did,11
Shami was India's go to death bowler in 2015 WC. Then after his injury he has gotten better in almost all other aspects but inexplicably became worse in death. His economy of 8.90 is laughable for a guy with his talent.,7
"KXIP with the wooden spoon

Even 2020 couldn't fix that",5
Faf and Watson are a muscular duo at the top,6
Remember when Mccullum and Dwayne 'in form' Smith used to open for CSK? Good times,48
Didn't watch the match. How good is CSK fairing rn?,1
Sometimes it feels like Watto holds his bat *realllyyy* loosely. I see the bat rotating in his hand so many times.,1
Watto just see Shami through,4

"They should have taken DRS for faf, missed chance",1
I dont think we have scored 50 in the power play since reentry lol,3
Nice one kl,2
Our memes have forced csk to form,7
"Watto or Faf had never been  tuk tuk players who had problems , it's the rest of them.",3
BC KXIP has fucked this match up good so far. Should have got 200 and now letting CSK start like this.,4
"If Kxip flop this season, they should change their jersey or logo.",4
Harpreet go brrrrrrrrrr,6
One loose delivery in an over is all csk needs,5
Why isn't Rahul keeping?,3
KXIP bowling can bring Jadhav back to form but he wont even get the chance tk bat today,10
Why does Jadhav always look shit faced?,5
Jadhav at 4 is a disgrace,2
Csk having a good start . is 2020 starting to get better?,5
"Doesn‚Äôt matter if they look somewhat rusty. If they‚Äôre getting runs, that‚Äôs what matters.",6
Imagine being in such a bad form that your 20(17) is being celebrated,8
Jadhav should not be in at 4. He is so useless,4
Punjab have gone full defensive ffs,2
How is it that kxip has two batsman in the orange cap and one bowler in purple cap race but still shitting overall as a team ? This is beyond me.,9
"guys keep on going, we are shit posting CSK back into form.",2
I don‚Äôt get why umpire‚Äôs call matters for impact,3
"Pls don‚Äôt lose this guys, I‚Äôm begging you",6
Why hasn't a wicket dropped yet?,0
some people are still watching big boss over ipl,4
5 over done and no wickets lost? What is this? Did they change the scriptwriters for CSK?,2
"You may take the 
**PLAYERS** out of **RCB** but you can't take the **RCB** out of the **PLAYERS**",4
"Watson does not look comfortable running doubles, an accurate throw and he's done for.",1
So Gayle is here to motivate players,4
How good is tahir in this tourney?,2
CSK 41-0 at the end of 5th over. What timeline is this?,3
Why is KL Rahul not the wicket keeper today?,2
So they did their homework today,2
Hopefully jordan goes for 60+ runs to show that English bias is stupid and he is a terrible death bowler,2
Dhoni is not a factor in this match anymore. Advantage CSK!,5
"every KXIP game this year has been ""why is it always us""",8
Mourinho you beautiful man!,3
"Shami just bowled 2 solid overs, but stats would show otherwise.",3
Rubs eyes. Good start CSK,2
"Feel sad for gayle, doesn‚Äôt get to play doesn‚Äôt get to party",3
Is this the best ever start for CSK this season?,3
Off topic but Yuzi Chahal seems like that skinny scrawny kid who somehow ends up being a big bully and leader of his group full of jocks.,4
"Happy birthday Jordan, bro",2
Kxip shouldn't lose their heart. Only these two and Rayadu are reliable players. Rest of are meme players.,8
What is the point of impact in a lbw?,2
Filthy!!,1
Both batsmen are playing at <120. Ik it‚Äôs a big step up but the score is inflated cuz of the 6 extras,5
Punjab is having great individual performances but is not looking like a team. Idk it could be me only but they dont seem as formiddable as you would expect after having so many good players.,2
Guys dont you think we are scoring erm ... too fast???,5
I don't know what to feel CSK playing without losing a wicket after a long time or KXIP pulling an RCB by bowling freebies and pies.,2
Is Jordan in the team because its his birthday today?,3
Fafda with a Sarfaraz.,0
Where are the powerplay score predicting MFs??,5
Seems like RCB is the fittest team in this ipl.,7
KXIP are gonna be that team which has a good start but ends up being the team out of contention very soon and then other teams count games against them as a certain victory and mess their standing in the table because they took them for granted,7
Jesus FAF...,3
Nice guys KXIP bringing csk openers back to form,4
Hopefully kX1p brings in Gayle back in next game,3
Faf is not giving a Fuck today. Lol,3
200/100 for effort,3
But r/cricket told me csk are done won't be in play offs this season,5
Why is the thread so silent now ?30 minutes ago I had left and it was full of joy and enthusiasm but now it's so silent hardly 2 comments a second??,6
"If these 2 bat long, watch Dhoni promote himself up the order",4
Imagine that catch if sarfaraz wasn't 4 feet tall,3
After watching csk opening corona virus power reduces by 50%,2
Teddy Sarfraz Katre...,3
Woah Sarfaraz flew well!,3
Thats top effort from Biriyani bhai.,2
Is it Sarfaraz Khan or Jose Covaco?,1
Sarfaraz is a chunky boi,5
If I had a penny every time csk was lucky I‚Äôd be millionaire,5
Is this the real life,1
Luck isnt on kings side today,2
Fuck it up faf. Go on.,0
Why did mi lose fair play points today?,0
"We scored 50 in the power play!!!

We scored 50 in the power play!!!

We scored 50 in the power play!!!

We scored 50 in the power play!!!

We scored 50 in the power play!!!",21
We're the most unlucky team ever,4
The beauty called duplesis,3
They're playing like they had a 50 run target for the pp,5
Jordan getting cunted,3
Imma say something very reactionary but Kumble is an overrated coach. Not only IPL but also national team,4
Du plessis obviously made a deal with the devil. Looking fucking awkward while playing but can read ALL slower deliveries.,2
Rushing to delete all the comments I made in last innings,8
"Is this CSK, had to wipe my eyes for a second.",7
O man....,3
"Rahul, Mayank, Sarfaraz, Mandeep and Jordan keeping the RCB spirit alive.",7
Who is that CSK uncle waving the flag?,5
WTF FAF.... playing dangerously,5
"Well boys, we‚Äôre losing this like we always do, fuck this team fuck my life",8
This is not the CSK we know in 2020,6
"10 run overs aren‚Äôt exciting me anymore, wtf",2
R/cricket here's your fucking intent,7
Csk : fuck r/cricket,8
Itne din kaha thi ye chennai,3
I'd be happy with 50 in 10 overs.,4
I am sexually attracted to faf,6
Jordan has traded in being shit at the death for being shit everywhere,2
This seems a good place to hide after the United performance,4
Well well well,3
"That catch effort from sarfaraz sums up KXIP‚Äôs ipl so far, great effort but not quite there",5
Well I think it‚Äôs back o Neesham next game.,3
Oh duplesis you are a class,3
Who in the right frame of mind would dare to pick Jordan again after that first match.,1
Remember r/cricket there is something called football heritage.,2
Lol what‚Äôs Punjab‚Äôs obsession with buying all the players who has played for RCB?,3
I just don't want to wake up!!,2
"Feel for Jordan, man has literally no confidence",2
Is.. thisss... C ..CSK? Thanks for giving some hope‚ô•Ô∏è,6
"We didn't lose wickets in powerplay

We didn't lose wickets in powerplay

We didn't lose wickets in powerplay

We didn't lose wickets in powerplay

We didn't lose wickets in powerplay",11
If they want a middle overs bowler then neesham was doing decent there,4
Csk fans : Jeremy renner don‚Äôt give me hope meme irl,8
SO MUCH LUCK SMH,5
Yeah so see you guys next year,8
Punjab please don't lose this that will be really sad,-3
Why would you even bring in jordan after the first game...he‚Äôs shit,5
Yeah sure. Jordon was dropped without a chance. We see why,4
Faf is playing with pp now,5
Faf done Jordan a dirty,4
CSK is back bitches!!!,10
GET INNN FAF FU*KING DU PLESSIS,2

KXIP:-*bringing teams back in form since 2008*,6
Should have gone with bishnoi for the last,1
"Faf is on fire , wow first time csk scoring 60 in powerplay",3
Jordan looks ordinary ngl.,1
Du Plesis placement of shots is such a joy to watch.,2
60 in 6 over. Omg.,1
There is no KX bowler who looks penetrating or threatening.,3
Can't tell if Jordan sucks that bad or Faf was just playing some really lit shots,0
Haven't seen a single game where Sarfarazs pajamas won't go downüòú,0
Maybe just maybe KXIP is the worst team in the competition.,-1
Can someone explain why everyone is taking about the ManU vs Hotspurs match?,0
This is just the start of Jordan's redemption arc. Wait for it.,1
Absolute shit show of a bowling.,0
Faf take my energy („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•,4
"Jordan is such a hit and miss cricketer.

When he's good there's not many as good as him, when he's shit, he's really shit",5

"Ok r/cricket here's what we do , we praise the hell out of CSK and trash talk KXIP to the ground.",3
did we just... score 60.. in the powerplay?,4
From Chennai Senile Kings to Chennai Sexy Kings.,1
In what way is Jordan an improvement over Neesham lmao. Even his great fielding is no better than jimmy's,2
That whistle is so annoying...jeez,1
I kinda know how Jordon feels like now. Getting punished on your birthday is pretty awkward.,0
The thread is so different than the one 30 minutes ago I feel like everyone's  gone to sleep and will come back in 16-20 overs!!??,0
Wow is this chennai?,1
10 rpo in the powerplay. Wow.,1
60 in the power play? Not my team!,3
CSK fans must have cummed hard. They were expecting 50 from 10..got 60 from 6,4
"Wow, look at that. Csk were doing fuck all in the previous games and now they have decided to play aggressive. On the other hand, I have United getting embarrassed. I hate this day.",7
Brar bowled such a good over and he was replaced.. no logic.,2
It appears CSK trying to score quicker has resulted in CSK scoring quicker. Who could have predicted that?,7
Kanavoo,1
Bishnoi will do the trick.,-1
Jimmy neesham to punjab management:üñïüñïüñïüëé,0

"60 runs in powerplay without losing wickets, wtf. Keep going CSK.",9
You can take Chris Jordan out of RCB but can't take RCB out of Chris Jordan,8
"10 rpo? In the powerplay!? Barry, what did you do to the timeline?",8
"Mujeeb in for Jordan. Gayle in for Maxwell, it's worth a shot.",5
KXIP management( in thanos' voice) : We took the players out of RCB to create a new RCB.,6
"Viral Kilo DoB: 5/11/88

Piyush Chawal DoB: 24/12/88

Hol the fuck up boi!!!!!",7
Easy win for csk if kxip plays like this.,1
Haha wtf csk.. now don‚Äôt give hopes... all family contemplating watching big boss instead.. now don‚Äôt let me put on the match on tv and you lose and they thrash my ass,4
What is this weird feeling? It feels somewhat familiar. is this hope??!?,2
CSK gonna take points and NRR both today,4
The problem with the team was intent not being too old,2
Jordan has an economy rate of 9.5+ in IPL,2
"First time in five matches in this season of IPL, KXIP have failed to pick a wicket in the Powerplay. CSK 60/0 is their highest PP score of the season surpassing 53/0 against RR in Sharjah.",6
I have a feeling something is gonna go wrong,2
Damn!! If koach hasn‚Äôt dropped that catch. RCB would have won 4 out of 4. If you have conceded 60 runs to csk in the power play. Your bowling is shit.,5
Love the swiggy ads,3
[deleted],2
Some shit field placement as well there,1
"Not exactly Faffing around, are they? üòâ",2
Just got into IPL this year. Was there a team that replaced csk when they were banned for 2 years?,2
I don't really get why they prefer Jordan in ipl?,2
"More certain than anything else is this subs generally knee jerk reactions, pessism in abundance and no understanding or knowledge of the game. 
It seems this sub gets joy by not sharing cricketing thoughts but just jumping on blindly driven bandwagons.",8
If youre gonna be absolute trash in the death at least have a good powerplay,0
"Unrelated note: People say Rohit Sharma is not good in IPL, but the dude has 5k+ runs and is 4th in the Orange Cap list this season too. So, where does this criticism come from?",-1
please let this be our comeback starting point,5
If any one get's out pls bring on Curran. The ran rate should be moving.,10
Where is Hardus Viljoen? Didn't he bowl well in 2019? Like really good yorkers.,3
"Plan: Build an argument to show how the idea of 'Umpire's call' is ""patriarchal"" and watch twitter (and a good lot here) cancel Umpires.",7
FAAD DU PUSSY,3
Look out for the shit poster who is never seen during KXIP matches but is back in this thread today. He must be Neesham,5
I hope Bishnoi can pick up some wickets here,2
We‚Äôre back sukkkkerrrzzzz!!,-2
All hopes on Bishnoi now.,2
"*Jo CSK openers ko form mein le aaye , uska naam RÃ∂CÃ∂BÃ∂ KXIP*",5

Incredible shots by Faf,2
"If Kings lose this, KL has to take the blame.. been playing too conservative since his üíØ..",7
After all the ADs I have seen I can conclusively say that Shreyas will have a very difficult career in acting,6
RCB transferd their choking to KXIP one player at a time,17
Why is Faf assembling his own helmate?,7
Can picture all ig memers with so many 'admit it' shit memes after today's win.,10
Feeling bad for Kumble.,5
Watson made it out of the powerplay. This is uncharted territory for CSK.,21
I think I'm done with ipl for the season.,-1
I think if a wicket is fallen here csk should bring in curran and let's see how he goes about it,3
"KL is truly Kohli 2.0, even taking over the koaching for KXIP now.",6
"Damn, ball isnt spinning whatsoever, this is not gonna end well for Bishnoi",1
How did we lose to this KXIP?!,5
"Reminds of vintage RCB having the orange cap and 2nd higest run scorer and at some point the purple too with bottom of the points table. As a RCB fan I would just watch the match for entertainment and for Gayle, ABD, Kohli batting not worrying about the result.",6
Have been supporting this team for so long yet they find new ways every year to disappoint,1
That was beautiful,0
KL is so good at field placement /s,5
Faf taking revenge of his sister from Hardus viljoen's team,0
This is gonna be an RCB chase RR score.,-1
"People calling this thread knee jerk reaction and not full of ‚Äúcricket insights‚Äù, need to chill a bit. This live thread is like watching a game with your friends, it‚Äôs gonna be knee jerk reaction, trash talking and full of shit. If you want analysis go to post match thread!",12
He‚Äôs mixing up the pace really well,2
Goes past leg stump,1
Bishnoi is just beautiful to watch!,1
Kings XI had a good chance to score 200 today. Rahul‚Äôs slow start could come back to haunt them again today.,3
"While this is a fantastic start, nothing is quite enough when your middle order all like to play 10-11 dot balls each",1
It's been 3 balls but jeez Ravi Bishnoi looks their best bowler.,2
Faf bats better for Csk than RSA,5
Hahahah love seeing excited raw youngsters,6
"Bishnoi appealed so hard, he fell down...üòÇ",2
Bishnoi deserves a better team,5
If teams weren't named after regions I doubt KXIP would have any fans,7
"Bishnoi looks like the Bollywood ""actor"" Siddharth Malhotra",6
"I am going to sleep now now as there is no fun in the thread now,gonna come back in overs 16-20 where the magic happens.",4
Smh too short,2
KXIP need their best player in action asap that's MSD ‚ù§Ô∏è,-1
KXIP‚Äôs only win is against RCB and RCB‚Äôs only loss is against KXIP,3
Majestic duplesis,2
Truly looks like RCB with Bishnoi like Chahal.,2
Punjab have played really well this season imo but are 7th....,7
KXIP gonna end up at the bottom of the table with both orange and purple caps,23
One down they should send Chawla,11
I am vibin rn,11
"So what have we learnt from this Kings XI season- If the choice is between Jordan and Neesham, always pick Mujeeb",21
If CSK wins today will they be #1 following the trend from last few matches.,0
"For people not from the 8 IPL team regions, which teams do you support?",3
Why did KL said 165 is enough at this pitch?? Are you underestimating us KL ?? Are you??,7
What is this? CSK at 10 rpo?!!,5
"Bishnoi runup - starts walking towards the player at cover, abruptly changes direction towards the batsman and ball is halfway to him.",4

"RCB and Chahal VS KXIP and Bishnoi

Vote down for the best pair.",0
"kxip selection has been reminding me of.koach, no.mujeeb or gayle as of yet, appalling",3
Why do I feel watto is gonna throw is wicket away now.,1
4D chess by KXIP so that dhenier won't change his team in coming games and will give other teams better chance of winning,3
You cannot have 2 inexperienced spinners at both ends. Gowtham should have been playing.,2
"Why does England select Chris Jordan ?
He has an economy of 8.66 in T20i.

It increases to 9.82 in IPL. Why do teams even buy him while bowlers like James Patto are there",5

Better to have Murlidharan as your Fast bowling coach than Charles Langveldt as your bowling coach. Sorry KXIP fans üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,1

Wtf is this field setting lmao,2

Feels bad for kxip man,2
Even Watson is playing scoop shots now just to show Maxwell how shit he is.,4
What KXIP didn't reach 200?,1
Watson dilscooping.. I have seen everything now,1
Watto you beauty üíõüíõ,1
I'm gonna order puri cholay and some chai and hope for the best,3
This is what I dislike about some csk fans. Don't shit talk without winning the game. No wonder people hate our team.,9
Watto 100(69),2
Yeah they need a collapse right now to save them.,2
Watson doing all kinds of weird shit for like SR 112,6
Something is off. Idk what it is. Maybe self belief? But something is reeaaaallllyyy off,4
Kumble looking at KL and wondering what did I do to deserve a Koach 2.0,18
Thing is Punjab don't event look like they're going to pick a wicket. All to easy for CSK,9
Who is worse at field placement: koach or kl,2
Lol KXIP are cooked,4
Nice goal,3
hahahaha. when things go wrong...,3
I genuinely feel sorry for Punjab.,7

Shami sus. No wait. Punjab sus,1
2018 final PTSD,2
Gonna switch off and log back on inside 2 overs. Usually a wicket falls when I open the app,4

Just turned on the TV and am i surprised!! CSKs back babyy,1
"Tbf Rahul's 50s at a strike rate of 120 odd probably isn't helping

You can say the middle order haven't performed but its hard when you only get 10-15 balls an innings if that",2

This sub sure loves to shit on Kohli with that whole Koach fiasco",2
"Not one to slut shame but keep your legs together while fielding, Shami",5
Chris Jordan is Absolutely shit. Unsold Mark Wood is better.,2
Its funny that Tom Curran and Chris Jordan are regulars for England in T20Is but Sam Curran has easily outperformed them this IPL.,9
Imagine Fleming‚Äôs reaction if he was coaching Kings,3

Faf has never been in better form in IPL. He was just there when CSK were winning. The guy thrives under pressure. In SA too he was the only one performing in recent time.,9
Good to see some intent from our openers,6
Even as a King XI fan I can't help but laugh lol,6
Nah this match is basically gone,6

If kedar Dumbav didn‚Äôt run out Faf last game we might‚Äôve gotten closer,4
"Well KXIP, RCB and DC all doing well in the same IPL was starting to look too good to be true",2
Sry to say but Kxip is the new RCB,3

"Do you guys think we undervalue the contribution of SA players in the IPL?
 AB is an all time great, Faf might as well finish there too by the end of his career . Kallis was phenomenal for KKR. Tahir for every franchise that he's played for. We got Rabada, De Kock, Norjte coming up the ranks too! I don't think we rate them as much as we rate the WI players",6

Man... Rahul is about to cry,3
Faf asserting dominance by peeing all over the Bowlers' figures,2
The only way CSK lose this is it Jadhav faced 20 or more deliveries,7
Are they purposely slowing down between overs to slot in 3 extra ads? I've never seen such gaps between overs in any tournament previously.,5

Intent motherfucker!!,5
I knew it. I knew CSK would massacre us. KXIP is just made for memes.,10
Why did csk have to pick up form this exact match lmao,13
Too many runs down fine leg,1
That‚Äôs god awful bowling.,1
"Just started watching the match. 

Is this a dream? How is CSK ahead of the asking rate?",2
This is our best opening partnership even including 2019,1
Kxip playing a typical season as always.,1
Watson still doesn‚Äôt look fluent to me. Look at how good faf looks v Watson.,1
Has there been a 6 yet?,2

I think faf and watto missed the team meeting,10

CSK back in form? \*happy tears\*,6

What is this field placement??,3
Oh Wattoo.. Wattoo...Wattoo...  üò≠üò≠ Thank you üíõ,7

Match thread much more quiet when CSK is doing better....,7
Only KXIP could bring CSK so into form they are ahead during a chase,9
Royal Challengers B-Team in full flow.,5
"Now just want MS to come out and hit a few sixes, won't even need to masturbate today.",1
Everyone was shitting on Punjab for dropping Jordan lmao,3
"From Cricbuzz
>Yash: Not a die-hard CSK fan but I want to see Dhoni come in at the finishing stage and hit a six as the winning shot

Nothing to add",8
how the fuck is every seemingly harmless shot going to the boundary,7
Okay Punjab badly need a wicket. Joke went on for too long,4
"This is how Tottenham fans feel? 
Year after year searching for trophy and all we have is just one Final to show.",5
Too easy,2

CSK doing a Sharjah in Dubai. 10+ RR wtf,6

It's just too much to process for CSK fans",8
Thicc Watson's thicc six.,6
Wattage too high right now!,6
Team morale: STONKS,6
5th tier,1

That was giagantic!!,3

It only took 3 losses to fire,3
"Ishan Porell and mujeeb in and harpreet and cortrell out makes more and more sense i guess?

Idk man. Fucking cursed",8
That sound of sweet sweet timing > sex,6
Somebody asked for a six and kings said ‚Äúright away‚Äù,3
Atleast kixp punjab was winning in first half of tournament in Ashwin captaincy,8

Anjum Chopra is literal verbal diahrea,4
Vintage watson,3
OK I just got an orgasm from the shot. Holy fuck did it sound good.,4
101m ffs,3
"Jis din watto khelta hai, wo sabko pelta. Just wished he becomes more consistent.",3
1o1 m take that,5
Was Watson meditating the past few matches to go into sage mode today?,13
Can csk make it to the playoffs?,6
"Csk plays one decent match in a while

Fans: Baap baap hota hai",7
Fantastic shot,3
They're cruising Holy fuck,5
101 meters holy shit,4
"Where the fuck are those cunts that wanted Watson dropped? Oh wait, I'm one of them.",13
4 losses for kxip then,5
Bish**chod**,1
Will we ever have this moment which CSK is having right now?,7
I just woke up....We're doing stuff?!?!?!,3
I feel a wicket coming...,3
And Watson has cemented his place till 2021,5
My brain is short circuiting.,5
Is this the longest till now??101 metres??,7
Watson: I'm still worthy,4
Watson : ooooooooooooooo,7
Watto has sealed his place in CSK for the next 2 years.,11
Watson: Runs are back on the menu Bois.,10
"Great

We're gonna get people wanking off Dhoni for sticking with Watson now aren't we",7
This match is over. You can choose to watch the mauling of United as well.,1
Makes me wonder why RCB bundled out for 109 against this bowling,5
That's a big one Watto,2
that six,1
CSK - How the turn tables?,7
101M Ooooo,5
this is just sad,5
_surprised kl face_,5
That's what they say about good opening partnership üíõ,8
KL rahul is fucking shook,5
The guy asking if there has been a six yet? There ya go,1
KL looking like someone who is having a sleep terrors,2
I think that was the first 100+ m six this year,2
"When your opener thinks he is an anchor for the innings in T fucking 20 format, more often than not you will be short of runs.",3

That one loss was in last year IPL final,4
"After the Jordan‚Äôs over

KXIP players : Ah shit, here we go again",4
"Watto on song is just a different vibe, like watching someone hammer a nail in one go and without getting hit on the thumb",4
People downvoted me when I said kl is not a captaincy material. Well...,4
Csk always turning the scripts,3
Will not unclench until 19.4 overs,8
"Where is that dude who called csk lucky today? I am not attacking. He got lost in the comments. Incase you read this, there is no harm in acknowledging good batting. And no harm in having a little luck. Enjoy the game.",6
Watto still got it?,1
Tewatia actually broke KXIP,6
Csk giving the sharjah entertainment that srh should've given,3
"I said to myself, hey, Sunrisers lost. We win today and we'd go to top 4th. Sigh.",1
Today CSK would have even chased 210-220. Just a bad day for KXIP.,9
"Inb4 a wicket will fall when CSK needs 25 from last six overs, Thala will come to bat, hit couple of sixes, and retains ‚ÄúThe Best Finisher‚Äù title",-1
Imagine having two top class openers in Rahul and Mayank and still finishing last.,6
"Alright, who's up for a wild bet of a collapse inside 160?",7
"Watch CSK get a string of victories now

Koach's shadow will always follow Kumble",0
Meanwhile KL Rahul 50(47),3
Archer with longest six - 105 meters. 2020 in a nutshell,9
I still choose to believe,5
"After seeing the first over I mentioned Watson is definitely in the mood to fuck up KXIP. 

He is indeed.",1
RCB lost to this KXIP is the height of RCB being RCB.,5
"Being Shami on, you need a wicket!",1
What‚Äôs going on am I am in alternate universe,1
Anjum cringe Chopra,6
I guess it's safe to say CSK will win this,5
Looks like they will win by 16th over itself,3
"The kind of a day CSK is having in the office, I wouldn't be surprised if Jadhav comes in @3 and scores at a SR of 200 .. Happy tears bois :')",5
I‚Äôd like more opening batting like this CSK pls thx,3
"Bois this is the first time I've known our required run rate to be less than 10. Idk how to feel guys, what do?",5
Not a good evening for teams in red. United are getting rinsed and so are Punjab,7
Required run rate is so convenient that even Dhoni can't bottle this.,10
"This is so set up for Dhoni to come out, bring the RRR up to 10, and then hit a last-ball six to win.",8
"Q: How to not perform badly in death overs?   
A: Don't let the match go to death overs!",8
the only way csk has a shot in this tournament is if watto gets in form. this is a good sign regardless if we win or lose,1
"KL has a resting confused face like a kitten, it‚Äôs kinda cute ngl.",4
KXIP has won only one match against a team which has lost only one match. Who says Kohli is not a good guy?,3
Chennai Spurs-er Tottenkings?,4
"Rahul exudes the same ""bitch I'm done"" aura that Kohli has",9
Whose was the decision to bat first here?,1
Damn! Only if Watto had played in the previous 3 games. All I ask from Watto is score at least 30 in most of the matches.,6
That‚Äôs why RCB let Rahul go for those who ask!,1
Someone earlier in the thread predicted 100 in 10 and then the remaining in next 5,3
Daily reminder that kxip won 5 out of the first 6 in 2018 and ended the season 7th.,9
this is playing for NRR in its own way,4
Can't feel sad for KXIP. One they have the tools and two Kumble is too arrogant to use them,4
The suddenness of CSK change in fortune.,5
Watson scoring after long dry run reminds me of Rohit in 2012-14 period where he used to score a  big one in an important match and then fail for many matches in a row before doing the same when push came to shove.,5
"KL is a gun batsman, but a good captain he is not.",5
MI won and CSK winning this. This is probably the most normal day in 2020.,13
"as a Liverpool and KXIP fan, I'm both elated and depressed",5
"r/cricket should start a crowdfund and buy this shit house of a team and assemble something competitive.
Tired of their bullshit for 13 years now.",16
I wish the team was just shit rather than underperforming,10
Dream11 participation certificate to KXIP,20
White Shark back in form.,3
"I wanted a closely contested game, this is just depressing. I can't even switch to football because United are an embarrassment.  

Fuck it, i'm going back to e-sports",3
Damn Fleming with his warm smile is every CSK fan rn. So wholesome,9
The audacity thou! CSK had a win % of 25 before the start of the second innings! Now KXIP boast of a less than 10!,3
"Fuck KXIP, supporting them is too depressing , they're cursed. Bye.",8
Imagine paying fucking cottrell 9 crores.,11
"Thanks to us, Watson is back in form and CSK will rise through the ranks now. 

Bow before us peasants",28
"People shitting on Watson - He gave great performances in 2 playoffs. CSK is not going to drop him this season, even if he has another dry spell after this match.",14
"CSK deserve to win this match, KXIP need to go and just withdraw from this tournament all together",18
Commentators should ask Fleming what was he high on in first innings,6
Fleming taught MSD how to dye beard,11
Ashwin did well with this team lol.,5
When Watson is in form the CSK lineup looks so fucking formidable all of a sudden.,6
"Man Utd ü§ù KXIP

Brotherhood in Red",10
Faf and Watson signed a pact in blood to not allow Thala to bat today.,36
Watto - White Wolf?,3
"Bringing CSK back to form right before their match against RCB

Thanks KXIP",102
Kedhar Jadhav will play next match...7.8 crores a year... doesn't bowl ... Doesn't bat.... doesn't even get injured divingüòÖ,11
"Feel like shit, just want Gorgeous Bailey back :(",4
Jordan/Cortrell next over,6
KXIP fans reverse jinxing their ass off,7
"So happy to see Flemming smile. Damn, feels as though he's speaking for all of us CSK fans.",14
"See CSK, this is how you play",6
If your management gets cotrell and jordan as your foreign fast bowlers you don't really deserve to make it far in the tourney.,10
This lady is the worst commentator,11
Is this the right time for CSK to screw up?,-6
Only way for Punjab is to get MSD in for a calculated 10 off 20 balls.,7
"Bench Maxi, play Gayle opening. Let KL come in at 3",20
‚ÄòThat short run might cost us a playoff spot‚Äô yeah no,27
Bishnoi has a killer throw. That one from the boundary got there so fast.,11
Has RCB passed it's baton?,7
You need Aussies to hold it together in playoffs,5
I rate Anil Kumble as a coach but him and the KXIP management really fucked up at the auction,8
"The broadcast team has full control over the ambient noise, and they choose to include the horns and vuvuzelas? Assholes",38
100 PARTNERSHIP I WILL CRY GG!!!,12
[deleted],9
[deleted],6
I think Preity Zinta was also still regularly getting movies before she invested in KXIP.,11
"As far as remember, KL has always opened for KXIP. I don't think he will go down to accommodate Gayle.",6
We all need a coach like Fleming in life.,7
Lmao Fleming just roasted his own team.,5
Shami gun bowling,3
Cowards bring in Kedar,5
lmao fleming,6
This has been quality batting till now.,7
Fleming: Youngsters in our team??? Nani,20
*101 KA SHAGUN*,4
Neesham might tweet something atrocious today,14
Good over.,3
Great partnership,2
Hahahah Fleming is self aware.,9
LOL Fleming embracing the memes,9
What's wrong with CSK?,1
This looks done and dusted. See you guys tomorrow for RCB vs DC,6
These two are fantastic,2
"lmao fleming ""youngsters in our team?""üòÇüòÇ",19
"""youngsters in our team?"".....LMFAO",14
Anjum making me miss Sanju,3
Best coach interview lol,10
CSK winning this,4
CSK scoring 100 runs inside 10 overs that too without losing a wicket - this happiness is already more than winning the IPL.  It's like 2020 behaving like normal year.,14
The genius behind CSK was always more Fleming than Dhoni.,3
Is Fleming more dead inside than MS? Hardly any expressions!,5
Lol. Fleming got no chill.,5
Looks like CSK has finally learned how to divide runs/overs,2
Fleming madlad. ‚ÄúYoungsters? In our team?‚Äù,30
Fleming is a top bloke,7
Fleming knows its funny because it's so true.,7
Fleming browses r/cricket confirmed,20
KXIP out of the tournament. In the most competitive IPL you can't go 4 down in the first 5. They are no Mumbai/Kolkata either to make a spectacular comeback. A lot of ex RCB players there so I say it with sadness,13
"Man i felt punjab and delhi are probably the strongest team this ipl, punjab still a strong team but currently they would be losing 4 matches of first 5",5
What did fleming say i couldn't hearrr,1
This js how the Redemption arc starts,9
Only Jadhav and Dhoni can save Kxip now,0
Bruh kxip have left the game,4
"There's no chance kxip is winning from here. On the off chance they do, they don't deserve it. This is horrendous bowling. You can't take a single wicket, and on top of that give runs at 10 rpo in a big-ass ground?",5
Jesus christ Jordan what is thaf line,1
"Jordan is back, guys!!!",3
"**So Far Biggest Six In 2020 IPL (m)**

Thoughts on Rahul's captaincy so far in this match or even in the tournament so far?,3
Shit field placements from kl,1
The only hope is someone gets out now and they over complicate the chase.,2
"Jordan's last 13 balls have gone for 53.


Cool 50 Chris.",4
Chad Watson 49 (30) vs Virgin du Plessis 49 (31),6
Thank you Jordan.,1

"If dhoni comes 1 down here, would like to see the reactiom",1
I don't think I will support KXIP from next season. It's depressing. Will support RCB. Lol.,5
Never expected CSK to play this good after 2 disastrous outings,1
Finally a proper run chase from CSK,1
Watto wins the race to 50,5
Bruh,1
Jordan is punishing KX for dropping him,2
The Great White Shark returns,1
Jordan has conceded 57 runs in last 14 balls,4
Petition to bring back Kochi tuskers in the place of Kings; at least Vizag Thunders,4
KL Rahul basically has a high paying job but where he is humiliated a lot,5
Just pack up Jordan and send him home. He's done.,5
In hindsight KL Rahul's decision to bat slow is not looking good now.,5
Watson's back on the menu Bois. This is why you back your players.,2
Jordan decided to make sure to not flop at the death by finishing the match before that,3
Shot!,1
"Still needs just 1 tight over with couple of wickets to bring back the doubts for CSK but Jordan bowling freebies down the leg stump is not going to do it I am afraid..

Wasn‚Äôt Jordan good with Yorkers or something, what trash is he bowling",2
"Where is the energy, Punjab are just going through the motions here.",1
Lord Jordan confirmed!!,2
LETS GO WATTOOO,2
Finally that 4 looked like his confidence is back!,3
Can the english fans kindly explain how exactly is jordon a t20 specialist bowler?,5
Did we just had a 100+ opening partnership @10+ RR?,6
Thank you Watto!,3
Can't wait for people putting WhatsApp statuses praising dhoni even he doesn't even play,7
"Vintage Watson, you beauty",3
Well played Watto!,3
KL Rahul now to take up bowling in the next over and out the whole team with his 150kph toe crushing Yorkers.,4

Time to support the real RCB now,8

Jordan is done this tournament no matter what happens lol.,4

T20 bolwer Jordan,3
"KXIP management reminds me of Billie Eilish song ""Bellyache"". 

Where is my mind? I lost my mind. Maybe its in the gutter.",5
Keep yorking if they makes you feel comfortable,4
lmao isn't Jordan the one who started the art of death bowling in England? Isn't he a legend there?,8
Fleming captained for 200+ matches despite not having a great win percentage! Proves how great he was tactically and why NZ trusted him with that team! It's not easy to carry a team that isn't winning much and I think it had a part with him not showing much emotions now!,13
How do we (King XI) recover from this? Our NRR will be atrocious now.,8
"Fuck yes Watto, go on big boi",3
"Knowing Punjab management, they‚Äôll bring in Gayle in next match, instead of Mujeeb",5
KL comes of as a mediocre captain.,6
Only 20th? Always thought the guy had more than that,1

I have to give it to dhoni and Fleming they back their player's 100%,18
This is one of the two good Watson performances we are gonna get this season.,12
Watson is not consistent with his performances but he is trusted to be a big match player. I hope he plays it this safe and continues to score.,7

"For those that missed the Fleming interview a couple of really funny things, I'm gonna paraphrase

1) Sunny G asked Flem,

""So you must be hoping you win by 10 wickets so that  you get no more questions about Dhoni's batting number""

FLEM: Don't know, they'd prolly then ask me why he didn't open. 

2) Anjum Chopra asked,

Chad Watson,1
Bruh if there is no Fielder offside...then STOP BOWLING THERE,5

The real crime is that there aren't enough runs on the board for Watson to score a hundred while Faf is also on the crease.,7

"Hmmm I wonder what this Punjab team is doing here, anyways I‚Äôve always had this RCB flair if anyone asks",5
Who's the guy with the flag I see him every csk game?,3
Watson cover drive down on one knee is a shot all of us have tried to copy,10
CSK actually playing for NRR here,29
[deleted],6
So close,3
Did he stop that with his ass lol,4
I guess we are playing for NRR now? But to win this time..,4
it's amazing how Punjab bat's so well and still manages to fuck up,6
cant believe we were absolutely trashed by this team,28
Its just not Kings day,4
I know few players who would have dived for that,2
Really Insightful info by Scott styris,3
Even 39 year old Watson is a more reliable than Maxwell. They should replace him with Mujeeb already.,13
"Every small thing is falling for csk too just like Flem was saying. One of those days. 

Too many one of those days",8
I can see it. The future. RCB knocked out of 4th place because of poor NRR. CSK take their spot.,46
Will Chennai move to 4 after this win?,5
Haters were right CSK decided to play for NRR after all....,7
"Plizz play for NRR guys. If you can finish this in the 18th over, that will be great.",10
Why the fuck is Rahul batting so slowly? He can clearly slog as he showed against rcb,6
RCB losing to Meme Kings XI is the RCBiest thing ever.,17
Was that out????!!!,1
"CSK Team management: Faf, you've to bat at No.3 and guide our batting till the end.

Faf: Sure, done.

CSK Team management: Faf, you've to open with Shane Watson and give us a start.

Faf: why not? Done too.

Yet another fifty from Faf Du Plessis, he's continuing his prime form. FAF IS NEW KL Rahul",26
"KL has been such a shit captain. And the team management has been bad too. If Cottrell is not a death bowler, why is he not bowling now? If he's not good enough for anything other than the new ball, then he shouldn't be in the team.",5
"Interviewer to KP: Whats your favorite time pass?
KP: In the Hole",6
"This fake apeal from Bishnoi has to stop.

He isn't in U-19 anymore. Time to grow up.",3
Bishnoi's action is a tad bit similar to Chahal's action.,4
Bishnoi thinks it's a rule in cricket to shout how's that after every delivery bowled.,7
Punjab are essentially RCB from 2016. High scoring captain let down by his bowling unit,11
Horrible field placing by KXIP. So many balls that have no business going to boundaries are boundaries.,12
Is the match showing on sky anymore? Just got kicked off for NFL,2
CSK playing for NRR again...positive NRR,8
What's the chance CSK loses? I didn't watch any match save for this one this ipl.,2
Punjab feels like a disappointment. It feels like Sanju Samson. You think that this is their year to make the playoffs and they start going on a losing streak.,8
"Baby you're my CVV , I'm your OTP.",13
Glimpses of that U19 finals there with the excessive appealing,7
...,-1
"Kxip, rcb and Delhi the mythical trio",5
Nah I don't care if it's his birthday or not,6
Punjab need to something like Delhi and change their logo and name and shit to try and bring some luck lmao,7
[removed],7
"RR over 10, and only one six. Magnificent",13
"
... There's a twist coming",5
Looks like KL Rahul's conservative approach (he was 35 off 35 at one stage) might make the difference here. They could've had some more otherwise.,8
Kumble is just not that good a coach is he,3
"For every other team : It‚Äôs one of those days

For KXIP : It‚Äôs one of those seasons",12
"From KL, I get the feeling that no team members take him seriously and just roll all over him. The type of captain who gets bullied by senior players.",10
KXIP had more than enough runs against CSK. They didn't show any energy or intent seems like it. If CSK had lost this they would have been dead and buried.,6
Which cock socket at Sky is showing NFL on multiple channels but no IPL,3
"Wickets? 

Kxip : we don‚Äôt do that here",5
Kangs Kanged. Good stuff. I'm off to watch ma boy Brady. See ya lads.,1
Who the fuck is whistling for their life?,3
I think its military salute time,2
"Sorry about KL Rahul did it again. He played too slow and didn't get enough runs from the 52 balls he faced. 

You don't need one batsman to go bezerk and one to play the anchor role. 

You need both the batsmen to play attacking cricket and build a strong partnership like Watson and Faf have, they've just played regular T20 Cricket without doing anything stupid and they were 101 after 10 overs. Risk free and smart Cricket",14
At least we have 3 crucial injuries to blame for our performance today. But this game is just a slow painful death for KXIP.,5
"CSK-119
r/cricket-0

Hahaha you love to see it. Just to make it clear I am not being cocky it is just for those who hate without any reason and just dont want CSK to win.",16
THAT short run won't be the only reason for Punjab's misery when the round robin stage is over.,6
"Thats a damn good throw,",3
Cotrell has an all round wierd posture weather standing or running,10
Faf is the most underrated batsmen this IPL.,34
CSK moving up from the bottom: *My Watch has ended*,9
"Why people hating on KL Rahul? For all we know, he kept the innings together.",10
"Joining late, guys. 

Looks like the scrape to 4th place is on..",13
Good banter in commentary.,1
Jadhav can't ruin the innings if he never gets to bat. This is genius,20
"Dhoni has so high cricketing IQ that he told Watson and Faf not to finish this by the 15th over so that RCB will get into playoffs even with their shitty NRR so that CSK can then easily defeat them.

Y'all living in a 3D world while Thala lives in 7D world.",22
"Graeme Swann is the Andy Bernard of Dugout.
Change my mind.",5
Star Sports commentators are very happy tonight,1
Could someone let me know why pooran is keeping in place of Rahul today?,1
One our way to normalcy here guys. 2020 might just do a tewatia.,5
Good over so far,4
Camera work today has been atrocious,2
What's the worst ad ya'll have seen yet this ipl?,2
The required rate has actually decreased in a CSK match this season..,2
"Aight, who‚Äôs gonna make 100 first? Place your bets people",1
"Good over, only 4 runs",1
So close once again. Like the 5th tome we had an almost catch.,3
"KP incoming: the required run rate has crept up, one of these two gotta move on , show some intent!",4
"Corona happens and IPL moves to Dubai and crowd is not allowed.

Me: ah, finally. I can watch game peacefully without those annoying whistles 

CSK members in audience blows whistle continuously

Me: Surprised Pikachu",11
Good over. A wicket coming this over.,2
"Cottrell = Tank
FAF = Casanova
Sarfaraz = I am sexy & I know it(Mr. Blue underpants)",-4
Why do I feel these guys want to get out themselves but unable to,-1
Good over that!,5
"Nan veelven endru ninaithaiyo

T: u thought we we're gonna fail",11
Why is my butt still clenched...,12
Faf has done so well this season. Man held the team together whenever things got out of hand. Today he got the support he deserves and look what happened!,4
Kings XI Punjab should change their name to King XI Punjab. I am told this generally changes team's fate in IPL.,10
CSK can't simply be ahead of the RRR. I'm making a call to Srini.,-1
Who would you rather have: Drunkard Shashtri or Koach Kumble?,1
Current Captain vs Future Captain tomorrow,1
"DC and RR games will rightly come back to bite KXIP. If you can‚Äôt close those games, you don‚Äôt deserve to be in the playoffs",4
"Its gone off of sky in favour of NFL redzone and T20 blast, and as much as I am gonna enjoy Nottingham beat Lancashire by 7 wickets I'd rather watch IPL, quality is so much better",11
Faf has never scored more than 3 fifties in an ipl season. He has already scored 3 fifties in 5 innings this IPL. He is brilliant this year.,17
Why isn't Rahul keeping? I'd guess being keeper helps with field setting with its strategic position.,1
Not cottrell! Anyone but cottrell.,2
4's are so underrated. They are much safer and keep the run rate ticking,27
"Booooo! Bring back Ashwin, at least he'd have lost the match by now.",5
Who is blowing those whistles in the ground? Its so deafening man,6
bowl maxi rahul,3
"IPL noob here, can any of the shit teams , ie RR &KXIP , make it to the playoffs if they perform well in the rest of their matches?",1
So they about to lose by 10 wickets then?,3
Bro it's just not kxip day.... Ball falling short of catches.,1
Every ball is falling few inches shorts,2
[deleted],2
6th time a catch almost carried. 6th!,6
I really want to drive my car over the writer who wrote that 'dukaan se' joke,16
If Csk had lost the 2 openers early. We would have shit the bed. Dhoni and Jadhav would somehow make the req run rate to 15+ and not have Sam bat early and do all shit mistakes,7
Just one 6 so far,1
Is there any 10 wicket win ever in the IPl?,2
"Win or loss is temporary.

Chase for the NRR is permanent.",11
"BC sab kuch hoga but out nahin hoga

T: game is fucked!",1
"If everything is falling short of fielders, that means field placement is wrong",5
No tamilans in CSK. Hate this,-2
"Kings eleven Punjab, i still feel bad for their 2014. Final loss sometimes",5
Cortrell bb do sth,1
KXIP has worst luck than a 2 cent hoe,6
Lmao did preety zinta went back to India?,15
[deleted],19
"r/cricket: with kumble we would've won the wc

Kumble: ....",17
This is peak level r/cricket reverse jinx.,28
His angle around the wicket actually looks v challenging,10
"Jesus, every time he hits it in the air my heart is in my mouth.",10
"So kumbles coaching career comes to an end I guess , next season they will hand it over to Andy flower totally.",3
Ffs stop with the whistle.. it‚Äôs cringey and irritating,2
Watto watto what what!,2
Hoping for a ‡≤ú‡≥à ‡≤Ü‡≤∞‡≥ç.‡≤∏‡≤ø. ‡≤¨‡≤ø tomorrow.,4
Take their whistles for fucks sake,7
Big DiCK SIX. Watson What a playaa,8
"Mahn, I just wish Watson carries this fine touch consistently!",13
"What a fucking shot, that wasn't a bad ball at all.",7
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",24
Looks like the senior players have finally taken off. Lol.,7
"Thanks Punjab, very cool.",21
Tomorrow is prolly the best game of tournament Delhi vs Bangalore,10
This is a proper hammering haha,11
Someone needs to tell Watto he just needs to clear the boundary for 6,8
Watto on his day will cunt a golf ball out of the park.,12
Watson is such a big dick sexy ass player,26
This was a crucial over and they gave it to Cottrell.,4
Cottrell can't handle pressure. Churns out dogshit the moment he's attacked lol,9
"Very happy to see CSK showing runs

True power of the Super Kings",11
u/red_rash gonna use this match as proof in his argument as to why CSK should retain this same team for 2021.,11
The OG MVP,1
69 ;),12
Wtf is going on in Tamil commentary,13
If Only we make a list of players and reverse jinx them...,6
KL touches his Orange cap after every ball to make sure its still there.,98
The last thing CSK could do to throw this one is bring in Dhoni as next wicket,8
Why is CSK scoring runs so fast??,13
CSK flourishing on the day Watto fires. Water is once again wet.,12
Can't understand why Gayle is not playing.,9
Are wickets in hand taken into account while calculating nrr?,6
Hope CSK ends this game by 18th over. Need that NRR to increase.,12
I want Kohli to call Rahul after the match and say hang in there.,12
"Maxy needs to be dropped for other overseas player if KXIP , sorry to say he is in a shit form.",8
fuck csk back in form with a rcb match on wednesday,31
 RCB made Watson bowl and played him at 5.,50
Kings XI were doing rather well in this IPL till Cottrell conceded 5 6s to Tewatia in 1 Over. Cricketing Gods saw that and thought- We can‚Äôt be backing that,63
Watson it's just a treat to see you bat majesticly,13
"If u are Kumble now, what do you say to ur team in this time out?",5
KP just said Du Plessis has been 'lazy' at the crease. What a god awful commentator,33
Bring in Chris Gayle next match. If you're not winning atleast entertain,29
"If csk has to qualify, I heard they have to win 7 more matches? Is that doable this time?",17
I knew kxip was sus when they made pooran the keeper,23
Oh wells seems like kxip is going to steal the wooden spoon from csk this season,9
"Rahul should get flak for his innings today like he should have for Sharjah against RR, he was playing ODI cricket, his numbers are so misleading, he plays for himself, not for the team, I just don't understand why people call him the best T20 batsman in the world. People see stats on Cricbuzz and then come up with these conclusions.",-2
Looks like the Dugout backs Iyer to be Kohli's successor. I can see the point there!,5
Cant listen to Mark Nicholas without thinking of [this](https://youtu.be/Sp_9SenDgzE),1
"Stop blaming kumble. He isn't batting, bowling ior fielding. If players won't perform according to the plans it's not his fault. KL being the captain and opening batsman is responsible to set the tone for the match. He is not an anchor, he is a hitter and he needs to get back to it.",9
NRR : Stonks,9
"I don't understand the logic behind people shitting on Kumble as coach. I get it, he was there only for a year with Indian team, results were fairly decent ngl. But people shitting on him for this results is not fair. I believe both coach and captains are equally responsible. If we are gonna judge him based on this stint, remember even Gary failed as RCB coach",13
"FFS, CSK had to come back to form just before the KKR match. üòë",23
Watson and Faf du plessis are just making sure that Jadhav and Dhoni cannot fuck up this chase.,18
Kumble always has the 'disappointed dad' look,12
"Thanks to Skys lack of IPL coverage seems like I will be watching the worlds premier T20 tournament, the T20 blast",5
I think there needs to be state quotas for each team. Min 2 players from state in the XI. Will help develop better connect with fans,4
Aren't commentators supposed to be rotated every 4-5 overs. Anjum Chopra has been on forever and is really getting on my nerves!,8
If CSK now is anything like RCB of the past they won‚Äôt be winning this,7
Why Punjab kept on tinkering with their bowling after a decent outing in the first match? Any of those were forced changes?,3
Chad Watson,5
"Yes the hashtag is 'whistle podu', but that doesn't mean act like a dimwit blowing whistles during a pandemic. Wear your mask and wave flags.",7
Holy shit I just realised the effect this is gonna have on the NRR,10
"Prithvi Shaw - the young Sehwag. 

*Looks older than actual Sehwag*",66
Couldve been 4th. Gonna be 8th.,7
Why don't Punjab replace Sarfaraz with Deepak Hooda. Sarfaraz is playing as a finisher and the only shot he can think of is a scoop shot. Haven't seen him clearing the boundary the other way. A finisher has to be a finisher not a ramp shot guy.,8
I hate this lenskart advert,3
"This partnership 135* is the highest overseas partnership for CSK, I guess.. Previous was DR Smith and Baz in Abu dhabi 2014 vs the same opponent-123",13
Anyone know what channel this on on Sky? It was on mix but there replaced it with NFL smh,3
"Well idk how much of this is KXIP or Chennai, but I'm not complaining",9
So KXIP is the new RCB,22
"If CSK wins this match, it will be the first successful chase on this ground since the tournament began",17
We had this serial downvoter in SRH vs MI who came with his buddies,4
"Folks, I have an important question. Who is better?

Watson in a towel or Faf in a towel?",11
"With Mujeeb sitting out for 5th straight game, kinda glad Kumble was shown the door as the Indian Coach",4
The saddest part of this match is that Faf and Watson can't get centuries....,4
I'm so happy to see Faf enjoying his batting in IPL. He has been soooo stressed while playing for SA.,7
My favourite csk vs kings XI match is still the  one where prime Dhoni came through the clutch in beautiful Dharamshala.,12
"Remember that one match between KKR and RR in 2014? KKR needed 50 runs in 6 overs with 10 wickets left, and Gambhir and Uthappa both having scored fifties.

Rajasthan managed to win by 10 runs that day. Can KXIP pull off a similar heist?",9
Kumble shaved his beard thinking this might change the fortune of the team,7
"Terrific batting by Watto and Faf. They are playing with control and watto's big hits takes us back a decade when he was a terror batting for Royals. If these 2 are in form and with Rayudu, Jadeja, Curran and Bravo, it may be too soon to write off CSK. Let us see how they do next couple of games.",10
"I know this isn‚Äôt an RCB match, but RCB middle order worries me",5
Kumble‚Äôs day is ruined and his disappointment is immeasurable.,7
just tuned it. CSK properly cunted KXIP lmao,6
[deleted],3
Kumble with murder in his eyes,2
Faf could you pls not make Watto run a double now?,6

"Anil Kumble's viking-esque beard died for this shit, couldn't even reverse the jinx",5
Just end the panjab franchise,0
Just how fast Cottrell runs - Damn,4
Punjab really are shit ain't they,7
Time to turn the tv off,13
"For a team that's very weak on bowling, it's almost criminal to sit out a guy like Mujeeb. He's in decent form as well.",7
Cottrell is so much faster than Sarfaraz!,5
"CSK, true champ üòçüòç",12
That was a dolly,1
"I came here to shit on thala and csk, when do we start. /s",14
The field setting is also pretty dumb lmao,2
Send Curran next i dare you,2
Why is the ground so empty??? Where r the fielders.,5
Csk are playing for the nrr but that's a good thing now,9
Watto converting threes into twos here xD,12
How good is the altroz compared to the tata nexon of last year?,1
KL himself onto the field.. Bc catch pakdo,1
Wtf is Anjum Chopra smoking?,1
It‚Äôs out!!!,1
Will this be the highest opening partnership if they chase this total down?,5
Interesting fact: RR not got beaten by MI in last two years but this year I have a bad feeling,0
Its been 5 matches and they haven't given a chance to mujeeb. Wth,7
Wide? Wtf,4
Ok guys I have a question. Who will be MotM?,2
That's not a wide,3
KXIP knew their death bowling has been shaky so they lose the match before that. Amazing planning!,11
BC blind umpire,4
That's wide?,3
"Clearly, the CSK management assembled the team yesterday night, showed them a montage footage of their past glory with intense background music. That's all it took.",69
"I'm so confused, where are the fielders?",10
I can‚Äôt believe we maintained a near 10rpo throughout. Here‚Äôs to the end of tAkIng iT DeEP,9
Ashwin would‚Äôve atleast Mankaded a batsman by now,17
That was not a wide??????,3
That was no wide.,6
You know on which team reverse jinx doesn't work this year...,3
Why am I still supporting this fucking team? Sehwag has retired 5 seasons ago.,14
Was that a knick???!!,1
Easy Peasy six by Watto,6
Thats not a fucking wide,7

"Well that's Watson's one good innings for the IPL, one more good innings to meet his annual quota.",10
"If Watson survives 10 overs, you can‚Äôt beat CSK! He is high risk, high reward.",10
Oh Watto!! How have I missed you!,11
Give shami this over,6
Teams should be allowed to review incorrect wide ball calls,7
"So, are bowlers not bowling to the field or Rahul not having fielders in right places?",3
There's very little justification to play an harmless left arm orthodox spinner who can't bat.,2
DC and MI will definitely playoff. Who else do you think will qualify?,-7

Bruh a whole generation will know Hema Malini as the Kent ro lady only,24

My father and i have just laughed at that run up.,5
"KL Rahul followed the steps of Kohli. But if he doesn't mentions **15-20 runs short** in post match, that's a defeat for me!",16
"Maxi, Cottrell, Jordan. Every foreign player has a dream -- to play poorly for Punjab.

Not you Pooran. You are now desi.",13
Faf should be the regular opener for CSK,9
Guys we‚Äôve done it. We have memed Watson into form.,18
"Watson is like that senior on job who knocks us over with his work and destroys our ego and then goes on to give lecture about youth, job and work ethic.",24
Redemption arc pls,7
Bishnoi might be considered for India someday. He‚Äôs been good,10
Jeez that run up really fucks up his momentum. Needs to keep it normal.,3
Honestly I really like how intense this IPL has been. All teams have a fair shot at making the top 4.,5
Punjab is still in the game.. they just have to pick a wicket and hope Jadhav gets promoted up the order,14
Jadav thanking the heavens that he doesnt have to bat today and get shit on.,11
Lol where was this Yorker until now Jordan,2
honestly would rather have bishnoi than kuldeep on the india team,2
Having two batsmen on top of the top scorers list and being at the bottom of the table is a feeling only RCB fans knew about. Now KXIP know too.,9

Chitting CSK not giving opportunity to shit on them,5
As a return of favour. I am ready to jinx players of others team to bring them back in form,12
Ah smh dew,2
Is KXIP so shit they're unable to pick a wicket here or the CSK openers are playing god tier cricket?,8
this match has been so satisfying.,4
IPL app‚Äôs points table page cannot be scrolled to the left to see total matches results.,1
"Why Jordan got picked, because it‚Äôs his birthday?",5
KXIP - Look at us we are the RCB now.,5
"Watching Jordan bowl perfect Yorkers in a situation where it isn't needed, should piss KXIP fans considering he bowls terribly during death overs normally",3
Faf is gonna scoop,2
With raina gone they should just offer a contract to badrinath and get him in for the anchor role. They did him in real dirty.,1
ELI5: dew?,5
What a partnership,6
"Curran padded up, probably not even gonna be needed",12
I think KL Rahul is playing 5D chess.,9
69 for fad du pussy. Nice.,15
Shit ball. So shit,4
r/cricket would implode if CSK makes it through with no wickets,15
With that body I bet Faf can enjoy pizza daily,5
So Anil Kumble gonna get sacked right by preity doesnt look like kxip can make the comeback,2
Mujeeb in for Sheldon I guess. Who's an Indian pacer that Punjab has?,2
I don't think Watson has the right to complain KL about field setting.,3
Why is Jordan giving Faf the birthday gift? It should the other way around.,4
That's now the highest partnership (162) for CSK in IPL. Previous highest was 159 between Hussey and Vijay vs RCB in 2011,11
Toothless. Even if KL had gone from the first over CSK would've chased it down today.,6
"Man everytime there's a boundary, I don't see any fielder close to the ball... where's the fielders at?",7
No wonder Ashwin left KXIP to go trophy hunting with DC despite being the captain,9
Wasn't this sub crying to include Jordan? Time to shut up now,12
Unlucky,1
Smart from Kings XI fans to reverse jinx it and commenting now ‚ÄúI called it‚Äù,4
"Looking back, the Lord initiated this turnaround with the twin wickets in that 18th over. It's all downhill for KXIP after that.",12
Too soon to unclench?,2
"Drop Maxwell, bring in the universe boss",7
Even peak RCB wouldn't lose this badly.,13
162* between Shane Watson and Faf Du Plessis is now highest ever partnership for CSK in IPL history,11
"Jordan giving the ""gaand lag gayi BC"" smile I had many time after engineering exams.",7
Jordan has gone for runs every time I have watched him bowl,5
"The RCB curse is dead. Atleast in 2020. KXIP is the new RCB.



Don't tell me it always has been",12
Priety must be pulling her hair now. *Kya karu is team ka? Kya karu?*,17
"Never heard of Birthday bad luck, feel for ya Jordan",5
We have more balls than runs? :'),11
Stop whistling you annoying fuckers. I hope you get kicked out of the stadium next match,-6
Punjab is a bigger choker than rcb lmaooo.,9
the problem with kxip is at a managerial level not a player level tbh,9

So how many more matches before we meme Maxi into form?,10

Superman Sheldon,3
Umpire nitin menon at it again.That ball of brar is not a wide ball at all. Same umpire is now involved in many fuck up incidents. Last year too dhoni entered into the ground when this shit gave a noba signal first and reverted it. And he didn't even check with third umpire.,3
Super Cortell,1
42 runs in 3 overs. Happy birthday Jordan. Side note Cottrell is a gun fielder.,2
Love watching fielding efforts like that.,3
"Mark my words, Jordan is",2
Did he just put a Jio sticker on his helmet lmao,2
This is how you should play for NRR.,8
Did he just put a Jio sticker on his helmet,2
Remove umpire nitin menon. Too many fuckups.,3
No way Cottrell is not taking performance enhancing drugs,2
Man. IPL Tamil Commentary is going crazy :'D,4

Cottrell a replacement for the A Train?,1
"Rahul mentions **""15-20 runs short""** in post match

Kohli, ""Ah I see you are a man of culture""",11
Jordan a death specialist to his own team,4
Maybe they should drop Maxwell for Gayle.,2
Is the fake crowd whistling or the real crowd?,1
"If a wicket falls now, watch Dhoni send in Chawla in his tank top and shorts",9
What's the chance the bowlers take constant hat tricks and finish CSK off within 2 overs?,5
Play Neesham you cowards !,2
"If I ever have a brawl, I will love to bring Cottrell with me for once.",3
Whatever said and done kxip‚Äôs fielding standards have gone through the roof,4
They should bowl Mandeep Singh for the lolz,2
Cotrell in the wrong sport. Bruh built like a running back,4
Just need shami to take a couple of wickets and give me 50 points here,3
[deleted],12
This match over in 3 2 1...,2
How does the Pollard fielding attempt have anything to do with nazar ghati? Could have shown any feilding effort where the ball goes between the fielders legs,3
Time for universe boss?,2
"Ah man, they're gonna suck Dhoni's big time in the post match show, not just after this game but until next csk game. I wouldn't be surprised if they even credit Watson coming back to form to dhoni and his tactics",0
Both couldn‚Äôt make a century today. That‚Äôs the only thing missing in the win today.,3
Rahul post match: We were ten wickets short of winning the match.,10
Boult and Pattinson gamble has paid off at least till now.,1
When and where will ipl 2021 will happen?,3
A BIG FU to r/cricket by CSK.,13
Jordan bowling at the death will be the end of KingsXl,3
People calling for Maxwell to be replaced by Nair in the select dugout lmao,5
Who will be the MotM?,5
Santner must have received a call from Motabhai,2
Don't let this opening partnership mask CSK's deep rooted middle order issues.,9
What is this miracle. Csk not taking it to last over.,6
Both these batsmen have faced roughly the same amount of deliveries as KL did.,6
So all the Indian pacers that Punjab has are untested bowlers who might end up batsman fodder. Wtf were they doing during the auctions?,5
"Let's make this interesting, 8 needed of 4 balls",8
"Jordan‚Äôs a death bowler they say, death to who?",6
Finish it this over guys. Plizz.,5
Weird to see such an extremely comfortable chase after CSK's recent chases,10

"Mi on top and csk winning, seems like 2020 is about to end",7

Wow most convincing chase of the season so far ..punjab got mauled by CSK,17

What can I say except..... DAYUM,6
Dhoni said we will come back harder. Harder than this?? Heck yeah!!!,11
[deleted],5
Csk has shown us 2 different ways to maintain NRR,13
It must feel great to go to the dugout not out after cremating the opposition's will to win,7
Maxwell's IPL batting average is 22 and that is skewed by the 5-6 innings he played in UAE in 2014 is he the biggest bust in IPL history ? He's basically the overseas player version of unadkat,16

Get mujeeb in for maxwell. Get gowtham in for brar and no need to bowl his full quota. Batting is not an issue for punjab so they will do fine with 1 less batsman and gowtham can hit a few too.  Give another chance to jordan if he still fails then get neesham in for middle overs,7
Losing all the previous matches was just a tactic by Dhoni to make all the other teams overconfident,27
"Stoinis played a rare blinder, we got screwed up by the umpire and then bottled it. Tewatia played a once in a lifetime fluke innings. Csk were all tuk tuk and Watson was doing fuck all, today they all go berserk.

Fuck me, what did we do to piss you off, God?",38
"Match 5

Honestly I am most happy for Dhoni.

So glad Faf and Watson duo is back!!!!!,7
Watson's back in form,4
Believe in the Lion!!,2
"Finally, it feels normal. And Watson comes back in form at the right time. Hopefully the tables turn for the better for CSK now.",16
"I understand that making change is not on cards and CSK trusts it's players but I still don't understand the inclusion of Kedhar Jadhav in the team. The guy doesn't bowl, isn't really a great fielder and has been consistently bad at batting. Don't remember a match winning innings from him either. Does his stats say otherwise or what is it?",19
Jadhav is getting too much unnecessary hate imo. Sure they paid him much more than he deserves but he's actually a very good number 6/7 batsman and has played some really good innings for India.,-1
I hope CSK continues this form. They might have to win 7 out of the remaining 9 matches,16
"Inb4 Mi Vs Csk final. Match tied, Mi win the superover by 1 run",21
I'm starting to guess where the script is heading,10
Can someone point out why the fuck Faf isn't MoM?,16
The INTENT is back,19
"You have to see what's going on in Watson's mind from the start. The moment there's a spinner at one end, he takes a more leggish guard and attacks the bowler. He's not batting to just play himself in, he's batting to play some shots. I hope he continues on this performance.",14
So glad we don't have Chris Jordan as our overseas bowling option‚Ñ¢ anymore,13

"If you can‚Äôt even get Dhoni to bat to use him to win the match, you may as well not play against CSK.",11
I don't see any overseas getting replaced for csk but I also want Tahir to play,12
Jimmy missing Twitter badly,1
