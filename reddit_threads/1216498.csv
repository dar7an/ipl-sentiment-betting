Why are you lot here when you could be watching Sir Alastair Cook score another century?,2
"Should the team winning the toss bat first?

I mean, only the first opening match of this year’s IPL showed that the team fielding first won.
Otherwise it’s always been the team batting first that wins.

" Should Stoin not open for the Capitals? I understand Shaw is a gun but surely a combination of Stoin and Dhawan would be destructive. They would feed off each other’s stroke play fantastically and could take the game away from teams in the powerplay.

Just seems a waste given Stoin’s success opening the batting in the BBL to not give him a chance at the top of the order in the IPL. Also given the fact he’s played a bit of cricket leading up to the tournament, it might take the pressure of some of the others to adjust to the pace of high-quality cricket again.

Delhi could then take advantage and work the left-right hand combination down the order adjusting to the situation. With Stoin and Dhawan, the game could be over very quickly but with the safety net of class and power through the rest of the order if they don’t fire. 

Again, not trying to take anything away from Shaw…love watching him play and a cracking opener. Just seems this could be a trump card for the Capitals.",5

10 off 10 is good getting but you are beter than that sam,6
Anyone here who watches latest episode of 'The Boys'? Hazlewood looks very similar to Lamplighter,0

Mmmmm somebody's had his cough syrup today,6
Pant is always conversing with the opposition,6
Damn Dhawan not getting the strike. He needs time to get going. Hopefully the next couple overs,1
Why tf is the camera so zoomed in? We couldn't even see where the fielder was for the first boundary last over,1
Shaw can’t rotate strike. Dhawan will be frustrated and throw his wicket.,32
Shaw got lucky,1
This is when CSK lost the plot last game. RR were 26/1 after 4,5

today piyush gonna be the part timer and jadhav gonna bowl all 4 overs,6
Shivaramakrishnan :),2
No one plays upper cuts anymore or what,2
Shaw has gone from looking like a kid in nursery to the bloke waiting outside with a pair of binoculars. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.,1
shaw is so fucking restless.,3
Shaw looking vulnerable to the short ball,4
"Having heard all about the Shaw -- Sachin comparisons, he bats more like Sehwag than Sachin. 

Very little foot movement and not enough rotation of strike. More Sehwag-esque",41
Is it just me or does Shaw look like Shastri?,9
Dhawan getting itchy,1
Who will be CSK's captain after Dhoni goes?,0
Dhawan is going to work his way to 18 of 20 balls,7
Dhawan will either drag one to his stumps or top edge one to mid on,4
I hope Siva is doing a bit better with his personal issues,1
The commitment of Shaw to go full blooded to hit every ball he wants to is nice to see. He is extremely courageous no doubt.,2
Who did CSK play instead of Hazlewood last game I can't remember,2
Just fulfilling to see Scotty sitting in dean's chair on the dugout gives us a complete circle over their friendship,4

LMAO we were supposed to have one of the deepest batting lineups and one of the worst bowling but we have 3 of the top 5 wicket takers in our team(i know early days),-1
Prithvi Shaw is way too hyped. Not Indian team quality yet,8
"Friendship ended with Ngidi, Josh Hazlewood is my new friend",10
Mark definitely hasnt convinced me he believes in the Altros he is trying to push on us,8
Why aren't they accelerating?,2
Shikhar Dhawan going far too slow.,2
"Dhawan taking inspiration from vijay tonight, might fuck someone else's wife later too",6
How could you not play modern McGrath from the first game?,4
"The problem with a Shaw-Dhawan opening partnership is that you have two batsmen who are incapable of hitting sixes and scoring over 150 (Dhawan can't do it anymore, at least). So they HAVE to make use of the powerplay. At least one of them has to go bonkers. Both of them playing safe will put incredible pressure on the likes of Pant and Stoinis when they walk in. Mind you, Iyer is also an accumulator so both Shaw and Dhawan batting a run a ball inside the powerplay is so so harmful to the side. Such an approach is acceptable if they have a Rahul-like ability to accelerate, but both don't.",4
"What are we doing, man? 

These guys can't be so cautious in their approach.",5
Dhawan started slow in the last IPL too and then went completely beserk after 2-3 matches.,1
the commentators jizzing over the Altros never stops being cringey. I understand that they have to do it but there is something so clearly insincere about them heaping endless praise on an ordinary looking car,1
Prithvi seems to have taken his dose of Cough Syrup today. /s,2

1. Footwork against the moving ball



2.Hairline

Shaw should be the only person who looks like a child and a child molester at the same time,22
Power outage... great!!,6
DC need some fire power at the top. Right now both Prithvi and Shikhar are in same category and can't start hitting from the first ball.,2
Can dhawan connect today?,4
Vijay is playing as if he has to pay money to play.,10
"WTF are DC doing? This is ODI pace, not T20.",3
Why does Sunny roll his Rs like that? His commentary is pretty annoying,1

"Same pitch as yesterday apparently

Might not be the easiest to score on then

Virtually everyone apart from KL Rahul struggled",13
Cue Dhawan getting out to a hoick now,5
This either feels like a game that could be nightmare for CSK batsmen or their bowlers are stepping up way better than they expected!,5
A wasted power play. Thanks dhawan,3
Dc batting without intent against the founders,3
Delhi are playing with an RR of 6 with Shaw and dhawan at crease. Are you freaking kidding me?,1
"After KKR and RCB, this sub has stopped jerking off to "" Dhoni bad "" is it?..
Fecking assholes, never realise the value of one of the greatest captain.
Well, anyways they will start shagging again, if he doesn't score.

P.S In no way, am I justifying his innings. He is not in prime when it comes to physical strength, but his role as captain is still immeasurable.
Just don't have sky rocketing expectations from him.",5
Batsmen waiting for chawla to bowl to start hitting,1
KL randomly giving me an erection,6
No intent from Dhawan whatsoever needs to do much better,2
No way prithvi shaw is 20,2

Dhawan stop fucking finding fielders,2
Atleast thrash the trash,1

I guess the debate whether Dhawan or Rahul opening for T20 is over now. Dhawan has no place in the Eleven.,7
It's amazing when we got tahir and santner on the bench. They will start for literally every team in the league.,2

Chahat won the race that's all he wants,7
Can someone explain what happened to Dhawan? Why is he playing like ex-test partner Vijay?,7
Chahar thought even fielders can't dive because of the desert underneath,3
Chahar used to be a far better fielder.,2
Piyush Chawla is 31 Ö.Ö,5

genius!!! bowl the same ball over and over again!,4
If CSK are smart they'll not let Dhawan get out,0
LMAO chahar afraid of injury,0
Why tf did we pay so much for this dude?,3
Shikhar should hit or get out now.. too many hitters waiting out.. we need minimum 180 to put pressure on CSK. Remember Dhoni is angry today.,1

Jadeja never was a bowler that was easy to hit sixes off of. Wonder what has changed after quarantine,1
I was just watching Better Call Saul before this started and Dhawan and Nacho Varga are 100% the same person,33

"Rishabh Pant takes his trousers off to put pads on, *tharki* cameraman zooms in, not complaining tho lol",13

"Clearly this bowling attack is not working for Chennai. I think we need to bring in Tahir and Dwayne Bravo to get some control in these middle overs. Can’t touch Watson or Faf, Curran also seems undroppable. Can replace hazlewood with Thakur to accommodate one of those guys.",5
Cunted fuck shot!,2
Imagine watching one of India's best prospects pass 50 and play what's turning out to be a very good innings and commenting more about his hair and moustache than his cricket,14
Chawla looks like a typical uncle that does his business without bothering anyone,1
"So what would you put your money on if you were a betting person.

1. Anushka apologizes 
2. Virat apologizes 
3. Gavaskar apologizes 
4. Nothing further happens",3
Swann has been saying badree all this while and I have been thinking it was the west indian spinner....same nicknames,1
"Think these pitches are also getting slower through the night. Not sure if continuing to choose to chase for dew, is viable anymore",1
"Giving Chawla a third straight over after he got belted in his first two overs is poor, poor captaincy.",3
Gabbar is enjoying Chawla,2
Did Chawla duck away from that shot?,1
"Darren Sammy used to pronounce Thakur as ""Fukhurrrr""",1
"Useless Thala not bowling himself and taking a hat-trick, smh",1
Goddamn statpadder getting in the action.,1
Csk somehow needs to find a slot in team and space around the field for Tahir,2
Dhawanos,2
If DC reaches 200 today it's going to be an interesting chase,1
Yes Gabbar!,0
Shaw is 20 and has a test century as an opener. Pant is only 22 and has test centuries in Australia and England. These are some special kids.,3
"Dhawan is like that uncle in the society who has a SUV and a hot wife, is either a property dealer or we don't know what he does but is rich. While playing cricket he doesn't give a fuck for fielding and batting too until another uncle sledges him and then he goes full on attacking mode and hits the ball out of the society and leaves for home.

Edit: He also has a farmhouse in Haryana and always has the latest iPhone.",5
"Chawla, please stop bowling full ffs",1
Why did you duck you midget?,0
We need the golden arm Jadhav,1
[removed],2
Both CSK spinners are absolute shit. Time to bring in Tahir.,2
Damn chawal looks sad :),1
Yeah smash this fucker Chawla,1
Press F for Biryani Boi,2
So we will get to test the net run rate theory again today.,2
"Iyer, Hetmyer, Pant, Stoinis to follow. CSK shaking.",3
lololol,1
/r/Cricket is cringe af.,7
Fucking finally,1
"Seems like Dhawan's wife is a better bowler than Anushka

/s",4
"Gabbar down the wicket is a sight worth beholding.
Brb gotta change shorts",1
"Why Dhawan, why?",5
"Sik a the won 

Attacking chawla",1
Just bowl pacers please,1
FUCKING FINALLY!!,6
What a retarded shot!,5
Yeda Shikhar. Was going so well.,4
The look on chawla's face says it wicket time,2
"Dhawan's done so well playing conventional shots, why throw it away with that lmao",5
What a brain dead shot that,4
That shot should be banned for gods sake omg,10
Why Shikhar why.. was timing so well now.. needless shot.,3
"Lmao what a brain fade

What a thoroughly useless delivery to get out to - was legit in the slot",8
Well that was idiotic from Dhawan,2
"Come on CSK, give us some hope. We are all down already with the SPB news.",6
Bad shot Dhawan,3
Stupid af shot.,2
Hope they send Pant next,2
They better capitalise on this,2
Dot ball!,4
"Thanks Dhawan, very cool.",3
And chawla has booked his place in the team for 5 more matches.,3
Want Dhoni to score 100 and do that finger in ears celebration,9
Just a bad bad shot selection,5
DC collapso inc,2
"**10.4** Chawla to Dhawan, OUT, he tries the reverse shot and is given out lbw **94-1**

S Dhawan lbw b Chawla 35 (27b 3x4 1x6) SR: 129.62",3
By the time pacers come back they'll be set and smash them also! Keeping on bowling spinners is suicide!,1
Come on Shikhar,1
There is no way on earth Chawla is only 32,2
Unnecessary shot tbh.,2
What a lame position to get yourself in dhawan,1
BC Dhawan,0
"Sik a the won gets out
.
Hold my jinx",1
Dhawan played a really sedate knock that no one asked for.,1
Dhawan was slowing them down. Let’s be honest.,1
Bruhhh.... Why?,3
Lmao was that a switch hit attempt?,3
"If it's a reverse sweep and not a switch hit, then technically didn't the ball pitch outside leg?",3
Things about to spice up,1
Such a bad shot selection.,1
Very generous of you Mr. Dhawan,1
KP controlling himself from thrashing Dhawan for playing that shot wrong,15
Ashwin and Chahal should play in the t20s for India ahead of Kuldeep and Jajeja,4
 there was no need to play the reverse sweep  I have no clue why would he do that,5
Lmao CSK fans will be having a party if our openers played like Dhawan xD,9
Lol Dhawan is so good to watch even when he gets out. Never a boring moment with him.,5
Dhawan to bairstow is the biggest upgrade I have seen in recent times,3
"Good set up in getting Dhawan out, credit to Piyush for bowling to the field.",1
Kohli got bowled to a short ball in that Boost ad :o,1
Plizz collapse.,-4
Thank goodness. Explosion time bois.,2
Stoinis should've come,2
"However Dhawan starts, he always ends up with 130 SR.",5
Pant looking thicc,3
Pants in hurry to go back to pavilion,7
Love love love the move of pointing sending Pant. Your batting like up should adjust to the situation your team in in. Take notes KKR. Send in your finishers when your top order sets the base.,6
Bach gaya bc,1
Ffs khade hoja pehle 2 min,2
Casual Pant 30 incoming,2
Pant looking extra chunky,3
Hetmyer?,2
Will Delhi collapse?,1
They really like left hand-right hand combo at Delhi,3
Uncle chawla’s redemption arc,6
"Apart from 1 match, every chasing team lost:-

Big brain IPL captains -  I will do it again.",3
WTF pant,1
Love how Delhi's top 4 are all good Indian batsmen,13
"tu beith jaa bhai, laet ke maara kar shots",7
Hoping for a collapse.,-2
Phuddu Pant out here wasting time..,3
Dhoni seems way more up for the battle today. I think he woke up a bit after the last match,10
"As KP said, it wasn't bad shot selection. Fielders were up on the off side behind point and the side was in a very strong position but he just didn't get low enough...was trying to reverse sweep without properly getting down low on one knee and got into a tangle to a full delivery.",6
Pant hagega,-2
GET TF IN BOYS,0
"Guys I finally understand why Jadeja is shit this year. 

There's no sanju manju to call him bits and pieces",2
And the run rate goes down down down,0
I feel what dhawan did there made sense. There are much better hitters than him waiting in the dugout. With no wickets lost they need a bigger acceleration which he cant provide. His own strike rate was decent enough to get through the early overs. So I would say well played dhawan.,3
Dhoni being sneaky with the appeal,0
I think stoinis would have been a better option right now,1
Did I notice that Dhawan even didn't change hands also while attempting the reverse sweep. 😂,6
Let's zoooo,1
Anything over 170 would be a tough chase for CSK.,1
Anything less than 180 from here will be disappointing,2
"*plays 3 dot balls*
r/cricket: WHERE IS THE INTENT, TEST MATCH, RANJI TROPHY",38
Cmon delhi don't disappoint,2
Piyush Chonkla running after the ball is something to watch,4
Dhoni thala god,-1
Nice to see the बैल at three.,2
Prithvi century today.?,3
Dubai DJ is the best... I just realised how well blended the sound is today. No jarring cheers,1
"Come on Jaddu, turn around this shit",1
Time to get ready for Dhoni best finisher to mastermind the nrr chase again.,1
Who will get to their century first? Shaw or Pant?,1
Prithvi gonna do what KL did yesterday,1
"if pant plays good, dhoni will obviously be gutted and if pant plays bad, dhoni be like years of academic training wasted. LMAO",2
"""Dhoni went the other way to trick the umpire""

Or maybe, hear me out, even he didn't read the googly??",11
In last match Jadeja had a better comeback. This match its Piyush,2
Why is everyone always shiting on pant? He’s one of the more talented players we have.,2
Only 2 overs of spin left thank god,1
Pant vs Tiwari = Sumo Competition,2
"Imagine appealing for caught behind on the second ball of the match

Csk: *We don't do that here*",7
I like how KP berates the execution and not the idea of playing the shot. He's more in touch with the modern game than the other commentators.,22
Graeme is so excited lmao,1
"This might be an unpopular opinion but I enjoy KP on comms. His South African accent, at the best of times, reminds me of Trevor Noah lol",3
Want Delhi to score a big total just to see how will Dhoni handle the chase this time,3
CSK definitely didn't expect attack from both side bhajji and raina,6
"Jeez, Laxman Shiva is one biased commentator, he's not even trying to be impartial.",4
Why the fuck am I watching Swann critique Dhawan batting,13
Just two more overs of spin,0
"**Most Wickets vs Delhi in IPL**

Harbhajan - 24

**Chawla - ~~22~~ 23**

Malinga - 22",6
200 needed for CSK to play for NRR.,7
Pant needs to mature so much in his game....its been the same story since 2 years,5
"Is Sir Jadeja turning into Lord Jadeja? 

More than 10 an over every match",8
8 over 70 runs will be good pls,1
Gone,3
How I miss bae Immy Tahir.,1
Who would have thought that CSK would have spinners as their problem.,5
Collapse please!!!!!,3
How to gift your wicket in 101 ways,18
Ooof,1
GOTTHIMMMMMMM,1
Earthboy jinxed by commentators,5
So far down the wicket that it should be classified as run out.,8
lol what just happened,3
"Ffs commentators curse strikes

He played very well, shit way to get out tho lmao",2
Dhenier baby,7
Fuckin retarded this from DC... Handed the match to CSK there.,8
I love this aspect of Thala,3
Is that run out or stumping?,3
Dhoni stumping™,3
Bring in Iyer while spinners are still bowling pls,1
Ok they will mess this up,0
Shamshuddin would have referred that to the 3rd umpire.,6
Fastest gloves in the south,7
Commentators jinxed it,4
Unlucky,1
Pant should target the straight boundaries often,3
Damn bruh. went too far down the pitch,1
"KP we get it

No need to say the exact same thing 7 times",1
Jadeja has been shit till now. I am very disappointed with his bowling.,3
"That's the most uncle low-five, I have ever seen.",0
"Literally, both the batsmen gifted their wickets right?? No credits to Chawlaji",2
dHoNi,0
Nice job fighting back by Piyush uncle,1
Lighting behind the wickets.,1
"Ah what a relief, surely didnt wanna see a compressed ravi Shastri hit a 100",12
Shouldn't that be a runout?,1
"At 38, MSD is still quick.",12
imagine losing your wicket to this chawla.,2
Still a great wicket keeper.,18
"**12.2** Chawla to Shaw, OUT, down the wicket, beaten in the flight as he drags the length back, the lack of spin means he gets an inside edge onto the pad and the ball rolls to Dhoni's right, who collects and stumps Shaw **103-2**

PP Shaw st &dagger;Dhoni b Chawla 64 (43b 9x4 1x6) SR: 148.83",2
Chawala making wickets appear out of thin air,4
Imagine getting out to chawla,6
Is it really a stumping at that point?,4
senior player got senior teenager.,4
DC by far has the cleanest jersey.,6
What incredible glove work by sir Dhoni! Hoping Pant paid close attention to see what a legendary keeper is like,8
"Dragging the back in their control in the second half of first innings, csk did this against MI also.",1
Perhaps I was too harsh on u Chawla uncle,4
What is the format for the bot to display stats for 2 players? I want to compare bowling stats for jadeja and ashwin in ipl matches.,1
Chawla is a smart bowler with his variations and DC batsman just threw away the wickets,1
God now I have to see Dhoni fans fap themselves to death for that stumping,7
Dc should make atleast 180 to have hopes of winning,1
Biggest accomplishment for Dhoni is getting rid of Chawla’s overs,2
[deleted],14
Shreyas walking out like an absolute don,8
"Shreyas against spinners, bring it on!!!!!",6
Thank before sheryas we ended spinners,2
"Good turnaround for Chawla. Before the timeout, 22 runs in 10 balls. Since the timeout, 9 runs in 11 balls, 2 wickets.",2
So Chawla will play next match as well.....,3
[deleted],12
Other teams should thank DC ... we ensured that Chawla remains in the team,2
Now we have to rebuild... Great,1
Disappointed for Piyush. Missed out on consecutive half centuries,2
"did he make contact? if so, is it a stumping or run out?",1
I'm just thinking of the ways this match could go down so that we get faf kissing rabada again,2
they're not crossing 160 now.,0
"Say what you want about Dhoni's batting, but his keeping is still top class",13
"chawla makin sure tahir doesnt play, smh",0
One brain fade after the other,0
Oh come on not the premeditated thing again.,1
"After all, 2-33 is not bad eh",3
"Do Dehli even need Dhawan anymore? They have an excess of openers. Pant, Hetymer, Stoinis could all open too. Stoinis was most sucessful opening in the BBL atleast.",3
BRING FAF OUT ON A TOWEL OR WE RIOT,3
I agree with Mark Nicholas. Only Dhoni would have retained Chawla after those 2 overs.,6
Team India should follow DC’s logic and rename themselves as India Bharat,2
That's a good come back after the first two bad over by chawla.,3
"chawla had a good comeback last game too, he takes too much time to learn what to bowl eh",2
Poor Jaddu,1
I thought Hetmeyer should have been sent out now probably LR combination is what might have made Shreyas to come out,1
Ravi shastri.rar got out :(,1
Ah fuck no Tahir for a while now.,1
anyone feel like Shreyas Iyer is Arvind Vashisht?,1
CSK should play Tahir.,2
Typical Pant swing,3
Panty boi,1
"After all the criticism n shit bowling

Pussy finishing his spell with an impressive figure",-1
Jaddu’s just bowling darts,2
Madman.,2
Ooooof,1
no respite for jadeja,1
Poor Jadeja being the sacrificial lamb,1
Chawlaji has cemented his place for next 12 games.,2
Oof,1
Trademark pant,2
Pantshirt,4
Serious question ? .. Why is this given as stumped but not run out ? .. if it was a fastbowler it would be a runout wouldnt it ? .. does keeper standing upto the stumps have to do anything with it ?,0
Sreyas needs to work on his acting to get those sweet ad revenues,5
Lord jadeja strikes again,3
Is karn sharma a better option for csk than chawla?,3
"DC should play Carey, interested in seeing how he does",4
LSK back. Fuck. Already claimed that Dhoni moved down leg to Chawla’s googly to give the umpire the impression that the ball was in line with the stumps. Vishuddh chutiyapa,-1
"**Piyush Chawla - 4-0-33-2**

First 15 balls - 30 runs | 0 wickets

Next 9 balls - 3 runs | 2 wickets",43
It's a joy to see pant when his shots connect.,1
"Future of Indian middle order at the crease. As Indian fans we should be rooting for DC....
But nah fuggit I hope Curran and hazlewood knock them over go CSK nayegalas",5
Jadeja has been terrible in all 3 matches,3
"Rishabh Pant walks in at number 3 after that excellent start for DC. Pant scores at 8.94 rpo against spinners in the middle overs in the IPL. Of all Indian batsmen to have faced 100+ balls in that phase only Sehwag (9.43 rpo) has scored at a quicker rate

Cc: cricvizanalayst",4
I love Mark Nicholas’ commentary,3
Seriously tho wtf is this match schedule? Chennai already playing their third game already,6
Fellas imagine Josh Hazelwoods body but with Cummos head. would there be a more perfect man,1
A bowler is getting smashed for 50+ runs almost every game.,5
Shit that would've been gone too,0
Should just bowl a wide to get a stumping,0
Did literally every possible online stream stop working?,1
Pant thicc,-4
Dhawan suddenly remembered about the cookies in the oven I guess.,4
“Both fancy each other”,6
Lol jadeja's appeal,3
"wtf are you going down the pitch, my man",3
Six at long on incoming?,2
"Jadeja in the IPL takes only 0.75 wickets per game and concedes 7.70 runs per over. 

Also, for a supposed lower-order ""hitter"", he also only has a batting SR of 123. 

He is an all-rounder, just not a good one.",13
jadeja looks rusty after all that horse riding and replying to trolls.,7
Wanna see the बैल thrash CSK bowlers at death just to see what tactics MS comes up with to stop him.,-3
stumping by dhoni hits different however ordinary it is,15
Sir™ Jadeja™ with 44 (24),11
6 overs left... Time to tonk it.. stoinis should be next.,1
Jadeja has given away 40+ runs in all 3 matches so far,17
"Spin is done, what a relief, *or is it not*",7
Should have sent Stoinis and let him settle,2
Pant and Iyer stays they just can take the game away from CSK,6
I think all this criticism has affected Pants strike rate . He played with a sub 100 strike rate in the last match as well and has started being cautious early on. This is not what we require tbh,5
"Bangar getting camera conscious

why does shaw look so old lol,2
Delhi slowing down :(((,4

Pant is not finding the middle.,1
Why tf does Prithvi Shaw looks like someone who's started doing hardcore saste nashe,36
"PREDICTION

How did Prithvi Shaw go from cherubic teenager to balding uncle in a few months?,20
Beautiful,3

YES. Good signs. Come on Pant.,4

Is it just me or has pant become more unfit,5

Sunny jizzing in his pants hahaha,2
Ominous. This guy can thrash the pants of csk if he continues.,3
why not bring in tahir and lord shardul,0
If CSK ruins Jadeja for the Indian team then I will never forgive them.,-4

What happened to Rayudu? Any idea?,1

What's Iyers deal he's got stoin and Hettie in the back. Switch gears,0
2-33 Chawla pulled off a sidharth kaul,1
Switched to dug-out but commentary feels bit dull but much more better than those cringe ads,2
Shreyas more exciting than Pant and Shaw hahaha. Democracy can be stupid sometimes,-2
Wait a minute... Why does the cricket match bot have RCB flare? Lmao.,15
I think Gambhir handing over captaincy to Iyer mid season has been working really well for Iyer to build his confidence,13
Please send KP back home he doesn't offer anything,1
76 off the last 5 is possible if Pant really gets going,1
No Sanju Manju this year?,1
Only fast bowlers against hetmyer and Stoinis. That’s great!,2
pant playing sensible cricket just goes on to prove that 2020 is the most scuffed year,9
"Yes the most exciting phase is about to start. Last 5 overs, shreyas and बैल vs CSK's death bowling.",3
Hetmyer's more stylish and exciting than all those three in the poll.,-3
Pant looking really good. At his most dangerous when playing sensibly like this.,5
Calling on my enemy (because he CSK flair) and our beloved u/kinjago for his Monte Carlo simulations! Please start publishing. I can't wait!,7
gonna miss the lungi vs pant comments,9
That cover drive from Pant! Dhoni could never play that.,-3
i’m guessing 180,2
"Big fan of Iyer, but he has a SR of under 120 in his last 18 IPL games. Simply not good enough, especially when you have Dhawan and Shaw (two 120-130 SR batsmen) as your openers. He needs to either a) learn to get off to flyers more often or b) Learn to cash in on starts and finish strongly. Right now he does neither. He generally hits a couple of sixes and gets out scoring 40 off 30 odd balls. Not good enough. Hope he changes that today.",9
"Moment delhi touch 200 game is over, CSK will play for NRR   /s",2
I like how Ricky and co and have just left Pant alone and aren't even talking strategy with him and he's just standing completely away from the group pouring cold water over himself,36
No criticism here but Swann and bhangar on the dugout have been giving knowledge on how these players should play in pressure situations......how much of it did they follow irl? Just a question,3
[deleted],6
"How are Old Bloke XI getting on.

Ah.",6

School boy stuff,8
lmao,4

The guy criticising Iyer. Those IPL stats are outdated. He’s obviously became a better player over the last year or so. His exploits against New Zealand are testament to that.,4

curran’s yorkers are pretty damn good,3
Deano 😔,5
Shreyas you need to make way for Stoinis sorry mate we need runs,9
Curran decided to be not sensible bc Pant was playing way too sensibly,11
These middle overs are always boring.,3
"Man, I'm not rooting for Delhi, but they are such an enviable team. All that potential and energy and possibly best death bowler in Rabada. I don't get why they don't get very far later in the game.",8
"Sam you are bowling well, thanks for additional laughs too.",5
Accelerate bc,3
BC hit out.,6
Where are the intent comments? Or does that happen only when MSD bats,9
Sam doesn't like RCB getting all memes,8
It's only the third match and my love for Sam Curran is already reaching Albie Morkel level,10
We'll see how India's future middle order™ holds against quality pace,5
is Mishraji wearing a wig in that lineup photo?,7
Pant go hit kid,5
30-40 more runs needed or its not going to be competitive enough.,7
Imagine sam Curran bowling Dravid in tests. He'd do that boundary throw thing every over out of frustration.,25
The headband is doing Curran no favours. Even the mighty Steyn got hit for 57 yesterday and I'm sure it was due to the headband.,6
Why doesn’t Jadhav bowl anymore ?,3
Nice field placement and bowling to the field I must say,4
they have been hiding Jadhav in the field?,2
*2020 will really be done for me if there is a RAIN interruption in this year's IPL*,9
I chose Dhoni over Pant in my D11 and m already regretting it,1
"even though he does some dumb stuff, i really hope curran doesn’t mellow out. his erratic style is hella entertaining",6
"i mean, they scored 10 runs in the last couple of overs. but the batting for some reason still feels lethargic.",1
Nice play this by Rishabh. Should have played like this in that I'll fated semi final instead attempting that brain dead 100% retarded ugly ass hoick over mid wicket.,-12
DC better defend well against CSK and not like the last time where they almost lost,2
Am I the only one who doesn't like the front design of Altroz?,2
No 200 today,1
Do Capitals think the par score is around 160 as they are in no rush to get to around 180?,2

When are they gonna hit? Someone said it’s Pant and Iyer show... when? Where?,3
How are you 2 down and not at 160-170 at this point? Bad batting.,10
Whatay gift!!,2
"I'll probably back Delhi / Kxip / RR this year, instead of CSK / SRH / MI.",11
Is this Dhoni's last season?,0
Chahar is kinda bad ngl,1
Lol comms talking about how CSK are pulling it back and Chahar bowls a filthy legside full toss,4
"Imagine getting 100 runs in first 10 or so overs, and then looking at a projected score of 168.",7
I should have had more faith on Delhi.,0
Gift accepted,1
"DC batsman: Not picking the pace

Chahar : I'll do it myself.",19
180 is a must here. With 200 you have got a solid chance.,2
"What was Sam actually thinking ? Btw he is going to be great and a csk permanent, huge potential",4
That's not Axar patel,7
Start hitting man. You have Hetmyer and Stoinis too.,6
That's not Axar Patel in the profile photos,4
I'm not watching the match because I don't wanna jinx DC's innings,2
The bowling rate has been phenomenal this match.,6
Faf fielding™ 💪,6
Cheeky Kaptaan... making Pant lose weight on the field.,4
"Chahar be like , I need to make this interesting",2
nice fielding god damn,1
"Such disrespect for my boi Axar, mixing the two Patels",1
another 36 runs.. would be a par score I think,1
"Hitting ones and twos when you have Hetmeyer and stoinis to come.

:facepalm:",5
Seems like Pant is taking it deep,4
"for how long is the ""havent played competitive cricket for sometime"" a good excuse? game 4? game 5?",3
Smug Salman bhai face really asking for a slap.,3
Delhi could have put this game away while batting but they have given CSK a chance here.,7
Cute sexy hot handsome faf mirite,1
Lmao that graph has Harshal Patel’s picture instead of Axar Patel,5
i think slower balls hold a bit longer than it does on Indian pitches. and hence gives more time to batsman for playing the shot,1
[deleted],18
Creepy! KXIP was also 146 after 17 overs yesterday.,5
Game looking perfectly set for a *MURALI VIJAY SPECIAL*,8
They're gonna waste Stoinis and Hetmeyer on the bench lol,8
Stupid ass commentators,1
Pant’s gotta nap after running three two’s in an over.,7
Nice breeze off Pant's bat,3
"If you are 2 down at 17 overs, you should have at least 160",5
Test bowler vs T20 batsman,1
Hazlewood looks a lot thin.,2
"Honestly when Iyer and Pant came out to bat 190 was easily on the cards. But they batted like they are 5 wickets down or something, and now Stoinis and Hetymer won't get enough balls to make an impact. Ideally Stoinis should have came in at the 15th over at the latest after these 2 being aggressive, considering what Stoinis did last time.",6
Hazelwood??,1
Sometimes Pant looks like a lower order batsman who has no sense of timing or where the ball is,7
tbh don’t get these guys out i’m scared of het and stoin,2
not a wide.,4
"Hazelwood is a massive, massive upgrade over Ngidi.",7
Remember in 2017-18 when knuckle bowls were still a dangerous weapon? Ah the good ol' mustafizur and bhuvi combo.....,8
Started my pooja for last over already,6
This will be an interesting period for Hazlewood. Typically test bowlers bowl good lengths naturally. That didn't work out well for Cummins.,5
Harsh.,6
That's harsh as,4
[removed],1
Stupid wide call!!!,-3
Three overs to tea guys!,3
Wait curran bowling the 18th? Is Josh going to bowl 19 and 20 back to back??,3
Dhoni licking is a must in the resume of IPL commentators i guess,8
Man that was hit with all the power,3
That was really smoked!,4
pant needs to accelerate from here.,4
Crcinfo says Curran is bowling? Is that true,3
GGs WP,3
jadhav u scraggly fuck u have one job,8
Kedar than pumping iron needs to work on his rolls,4
Pant still not at his best,6
That's BBL quality fielding,6
"Hazlewood's bowling, not Curran guys",5
Shaw looks like the uncle who won't return your ball if it falls in his house,15
Ye kedar jadhav me kis baat ka attitude he? /s,5
Ahh the specialist squad filler Jadhav,16
I am squirming at the thought that hetmyer and stoinis are sitting in dugout.,16
Kedar looks denser than before.,6
They need to pull out 40 runs in 2.5 overs somehow.,10
Iyer at the death has always given me Ross Taylor vibes lol,12
so hazelwood is gonna bowl the final over. will be interesting to see how he fares vs lungi.,10
Who is giving 30 runs last over today?,9
"Pant even not trying to go big

Idolatry gone wrong",6
"If Hazelwood had a more manly face, he would look so much more menacing both skill and attitude wise.",7
too many bowls were wasted at the top,4
"All main fast bowlers like Bumrah, Hazelwood, Jofra , Rabada and Shami have been good, I think Cummins will bounce back tomorrow.",2
Gentle reminder to upvote the match thread,5
Shreyas needs to get going soon.,3
Let me just say it.. Shreyas can't do power hitting like K L Rahul did yesterday.. should have sent stoinis or hetmyer before himself..,7
let’s go panty! oh wait,5
I remember Pant playing that exact crouched leg glance to another leg stump full toss off Hazlewood during his 159 in Sydney. Absolutely creamed that one tho.,4
You gotta be cautious against CSK as it's a dangerous team,1
Would definitely rather have Hetmyer at the crease than Iyer rn,4
2 sixes so far. From this Delhi batting lineup,14
That was the ugliest cover drive I have seen in my life,3
What's with the montage music hahaha,2
What a ball,1
This innings would be perfect for a 50 over game,4
Score is already looking good,1
DC to score 170 and call it a day.,4
Kedar is denser than Jupiter,1
cool Stoinis next,1
Inb4 Dhoni comes to bat 8 down for banter,6
How the fuck have we not made 200 here,6
Excellent off side hitting from Pant today so far which isn't exactly his stong side.,3
damn hazlewood chahar curran is a very solid pacer lineup,3
Csk got an awesome deal with hazelwood,3
DC never got into top gear today imo,4
"If you have 8+ wickets by 13th over, it should be hit out or get out.

It's pity to see abilities of hetmeyer and stoinis wasted here",5
[deleted],2
I’m afraid we don’t have the bowling to even defend 180 against csk :( All hopes on Rabada to have a good day,2
Stoi or hetmeyer in next? Suggestions,0
Shaw is gonna hit puberty one of these days,0
Too bad Shreyas doesn't have any offspinners to whack loll,2
they need at least one 20+ run over.,0
"Csk playing with only 5 bowlers

Fielding compensating for 6th n leaking runs",1
Ffs please get the score to 180-190 atleast.,2
Ayy Red Hot Chilli Peppers is playing,2
Need a 20 run over,3
Crcinfo commentary is hilariously biased against CSK,3
Memories of thwacking बैल gave our bowlers last year are resurfacing,-1
"I don't even know why DC are sweating it, just declare rn. CSK ain't making anything above 150. I mean DC got Rabada, Nortje, Mishra.",3
Gosh Curran the mark has been made,2
Stoinis and Paulo Costa are in UAE at the same time. Someone write the fanfic,2
Nice! Chased him with the ball,1
Hazlewood lucky to get away with only 11 from that over.,2
Iyer needs to get out,5
Lot of responsibility on such young shoulders.,1
"3 great fielders in one frame. 

Ponting Kaif and Ishanth",4
"Hazelwood bowls 19th

Who tf bowls last? Chahar?",-4
Is it just me or kedar jadhav looks in bad mental space?,1
"I'd rather face Starc or Bumrah, than Hazelwood honestly. That consistency is a rare skill. I was so pissed as an Indian that he wasn't picked for wc19  ODIs.",4
Iyer bro hit the ball.,4
This is extremely average batting.,1
"Very cool, Curran. Very cool.",3
Oh god iyer what r u doing,3
1 boundary in 19 balls for Iyer,5
fuck this shit,4
Iyer isn't good at the death,6
wtf 2 dot balls...,6
Iyer has been incredibly stupid and selfish with his batting today.. ridiculous,11
JUST TAKE A SINGLE,2
Sam ‘Genghis Khan’ Curran.,5
[removed],6
Just get to 180 now! Stupid batting.,2
Mature Curran,2
This is so frustrating. Shreyas get yourself out.,4
Thank God he didn't throw the ball this time,3
I have seen that Iyer is not that destructive against fast bowlers. Needs to improve.,5
nice fielding and throw.,3
Why have Watson and Jadhav not bowled?,1
So Delhi feasted on the spinners but other than that they've been shit,2
Stoinis in killer form. Naturally he belongs in the dugout.,5
Iyer forgot this is a 20 over match.,6
Iyer can only hit against spin,4
Iyer from delhi or gokuldham society?,3
Hmm 1 run in 3 balls of 19th over with only 2 wickets down. Delhi stuff.,5
My mother just looked at Curran and went all “he looks like such a sweet boy”,13
3 balls 1 run. Iyer MotM,1
There's no top gear.,2
[deleted],-4
Imran Tahir the team man,1
"Now, just send Sam to open and we can have a good time",5
Iyer being stupid and selfish today.,1
Iyer is waiting for a spinner to come on,2
England is going to win the next T20 worldcup,3
They batted really slowly between the overs,3
this is just utter waste of wickets.,4
What a flex by Curran. Having a guy bring a full towel to wipe,4
curran has a spot on the english team after this ipl he’s too good to pass up,3
If DC fails to win it's Iyer's fault,-1
what a choke job from Iyer.,1
Can someone tell me where is DJ Bravo?,1
"2(4) in 19th over, Curran the MVP.",4
Delhi would have 300 if Muscles opened smh,5
Fabulous over so far,5
Iyer don't tuk tuk please,3
Fucking penultimate over and this is what we do.,7
Yeah they are bungling this. 10-20 runs short,6
Less than 2 overs left and both your most inform and most destructive batsmen haven't faced a ball.,4
Stoinis and hetmyer totally wasted on bench,7
Abysmal death batting rn,10
Stoinis wasted in the shed,5
Poor batting,3
THALA CATCH WOW,5
If both of these fuckers gonna play dhoni amd start hitting in the last over i am gonna loose my mind,1
We need a jofraesqu and lungi over,-1
I hope Punter gives Iyer a proper bollocking at the halfway stage. This innings is right up there alongside Dhoni vs RR as the worst knock of IPL 2020. Zero intent all innings. Unacceptable. Inexcusable.,6
Holy shit superman,7
Good riddance,3
Instead of saying delhi lack intent how about you praise CSK for bowling well!,5
Thank God.. maybe we will get a 15+ over now.,1
That was such a shit innings by Iyer wtf,3
Fantastic catch man,3
SamC is literally the best bowler on the planet,8
My man Pant recoiling from his shot like he shot a fucking shotgun,5
I guess they scored around 70 in last 10 overs,1
Played too safe today,3
I feel Iyer has limited range of shots,5
Tactical batting by these two in the 19th over,3
Damn good catch from Dhoni. Man's fitness at peak.,10
"Old man Dhoni just missed an easy catch. Ohhh, wait!!!!",3
Iyer can't accelerate against pace,2
what a catch,6
"Brilliant finish from Sam Curran

Great over",7
That is brilliant death bowling from curran.,6
"Sam Curran is not only better in tests than his brother, but is he now trying to steal white-ball away from Tom?",9
"This shit’s frustrating 

Get out Iyer",4
Dhoni diving catch - that's almost a brand new sentence.,6
Sam “Bumrah” Curran bowling so well in death overs.,13
CSK has done well here. 175 isn't an earth shattering score especially when you've only lost 2 wickets in 19.,5
Where is my 30 run over DC?,4
Sam Curran is GOAT,10
"**18.6** Curran to Iyer, OUT,  **161-3**

SS Iyer c &dagger;Dhoni b Curran 26 (22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 118.18",3
Sam you brilliant boy,8
Thala fans orgasmed altogether,5
Brilliant from Curran! Been a standout performer for CSK so far.,21
DC wasted away their last 10 overs. Very disappointing.,3
Aakash Chopra is an awful commentator,6
Dhoni should have dropped it Iyer was helping Chennai,6
Man that spiderman jump,12
Brilliant bowling,2
"Wait, what xD",4
Thanks Iyer for allowing Stoinis to play 3-4 balls.,2
"Man don't call Iyer selfish, may be they are bowling proper areas. Remember that over in ODIs he got 24 or 26 earlier this year.",5
What about intent now?,8
Nice catch by Dhoni!,7
Thank you Dhoni for taking that catch. Delhi can score more than couple of runs for final over now,3
SIKEEE CATCHHHH,1
Curran is damn good at just 22! Going to be in CSK for a couple of decades.....,8
DC will win by 29 runs,0
"We should've scored 190 atleast, going to be tough on the bowlers now.",1
Imao even Rahane had a SR of 137 last season.,8
"ANDDDD, my social media will be full of those beauty",2
Iyer ate DC's momentum. Great catch by the big D.,8
Curran Arjun,2
Fucking hell Iyer that was shit,3
Why has Jadhav not bowled?,1
Hi dhoni haters did y’all watch that catch,6
"Tbh, I never thought SamC would do this well.. PTSD to that India tour of England!",2
"Dhoni cheated, he can't jump like this. /s",4
How can they give it out without going to third ump with dhoni behind?,0
Beautiful catch by Dhoni!!,2
Flying Dhoni,2
Back foot no-ball?,1
Flying Thala,2
"Keep like a cat, bat like a turtle 





~Dhoni circa 2020",9
Delhi were really bad in this innings.,2
Say whatever about Dhoni the batsman and captain. Dhoni the keeper is still a rockstar.,10
DC need 20+ runs of this final over,1
4 runs and a wicket in 19th over. Curran!,5
Damn that’s some jump by Dhoni,4
1-27 for Curran. EPIC,6
UNBELIEVABLE  wonderful by sir Dhoni. Pant has front row seat to sir Dhoni Masterclass today,1
I can't even jump like that in my 20s,1
Really good bowling by csk to pull back. Dhoni's wicketkeeping skills always remain top notch,1
Great I jinxed DC's innings. I ain't gonna try to watch the match again.,3
SAM FUCKKING CURRAN!,5
Turtle out of shell to catch the ball,5
Hoping for some stoinis magic that’s our only hope,2
Only if Iyer's game against pace was half as good as his game against spin.,3
This is our middle order ffs,4
Casual Old Monk reference by Scott Styris. Scotty boi has seen the world alright.,3
Hazle nut vs Stoinis,1
"talk as much about his ultra slow batting but currently, no one can beat him in terms of wk",4
After that Shaw show can you believe Delhi is ending up ~160,4
"Oh Delhi. 

You disappointed with the score.",5
Crazy that Dhoni didn't wait till the final 3 balls of the innings to take that catch,7
MSD’s batting might have declined but not his keeping.,9
Pant plays the ugliest shots,5
Incredibly stupid batting this,2
This wicket will be celebrated more by Delhi.,3
Thank god  Stoinis isn't batting,2
"Hetmeyer should've been in over Pant. There was a lot of wickets to play with, so if he got out early no big deal. But his potential for sixes/fours is way greater than Pant.",3
We’ll never win god wtf,2
lol what ?,1
Absolute shite death batting by DC. May have lost the match here.,4
CSK has pulled back beautifully. DC were 90-0 at the half mark.,4
Why isn’t Shimron there?,2
[removed],2
4 runs and a wicket in the 19th wow,3
[deleted],-1
Dhoni and watto's relationship always makes me go 'huh',12
Just get a single you fucker.,2
What was that Pant,0
"Poor reading of the game by Iyer.
DC screwed up the great start, score should have been closer to 200 but looks like they may not even get to 170.",3
"Pant, not everyone is Dilshan.",6
This has been a pretty poor effort from Delhi given the amount of wickets they have left. I hope for Delhi’s sake that the pitch is sluggish.,8
Iyer contender for the worst innings in this IPL so far.,7
Finally something connected.,1
Panties off,1
4 runs and a wicket in the penultimate over. Bad batting,8
Difference between CSK and RCB can be seen today.,8
Yeah Pant is better than KL,1
DC have shit the bed with 8 wickets in hand.,4
Iyer is dollar store Manish Pandey.,6
"Sam u beauty

Just 4 runs n a wicket from penultimate over with 2 set batsman 

Might well be a game changer over",6
Why can't this version of Pant ever turn up for India ODIs.,12
When you have the power game why would you try the ramp.,3
Wow Scotty loves Old Monk,2
Delhi would be 200+ if stoinis actually gets to bat some overs,2
Strange how when Punjab had Curran they barely played him and when they did they barely bowled him too. For CSK now he can reliably bowl 4 overs and is basically a middle order batsmen with Dhoni promoting him lol.,11
"Sam Curran damn boi,...

why did you buy Stoinis if you won't send him man, he should have came before Iyer today",3
"If you are an Indian cricket fan who only sees Sam Curran when he’s playing in the IPL or against India,  you would surely think he’s the best cricketer in the world.",57
"Lol, so poor from iyer and pant when Shimron and Stoinis were there next",4
Stoinks,3
Where has Pant's timing gone,3
"Last game they got 20 more than they should've, this game, 20 less.",1
"Really disappointed with the batting. DC need some fire power at the top. Forget about chasing 200+ they can't even set good score, if they have similar kind of opener batting for them.",3
Well that will make up for that stupid over-throw.,13
Zampa got his fingers crossed,2
The pacers have done a very good job of containing the score.,1
This should’ve been 175+ easily.,1
"Wait, why hasn't Thakur bowled so far in the series? Good move, but why is he in team then?",1
Curran is the player of the first week. Been brilliant,5
They should've sent Stoinis instead of Iyer tbh.,7
1st match when hotstar hasn't lagged even a bit. Just felt like mentioning.,6
18:(3) for stoin,2
10 runs would be an amazing over Joshie,1
"Even if the final over goes for plenty, this has been brilliant death bowling by Curran + Hazlewood. Executed really well and going for fuller deliveries and yorkers instead of the run of the mill short of a length shite bowling we've seen so far in the tourney.",5
Can't wait for Cricinfo's smart stats to say how Iyer had a -15 run contribution this innings based on the situation lol.,8
"CSK really needs to have alternatives for Jadeja. Why not bowl two overs each of Jadhav and Jadeja instead of a full 4 overs of Jadeja?

Tahir would be awesome to have but obviously we can't play him because of the 4 overseas players rule (unless we decide to replace Ngidi/Hazelwood with Thakur).",2
Iyer turned into 2014 t20 final Yuvraj,10
Despite seemingly slow innings pant still has a SR of 150,6
Pant needs a good belt in the final overs,2
Cheeky hulk,8
Josh and Sam Curran have been extremely smart in death overs,2
"I was happy when we got Sam in the auction but never did I think that he'd me my favorite player in the team. Tbh, I wasn't even sure he was gonna make the playing 11, lol( cuz champion champion)",6
Pant I get it that you want to make return to ODI team while playing like this but this is not the time to so so..,1
"Good bowling, even better response.",1
Just get to 180 somehow,3
Everyone knows if Dhoni played this Pant innings people will say he is selfish and stat padding.,3
"Amazing stuff from Sam man, dude is aggressive both in bowling and batting.",6
Yeah. Has taken Stoinis one ball to expose Iyer's atrocious knock lol.,7
Csk couldnt even get wickets bc pant and iyer played an ODI knock,8
I really really hope Ponting gives an earful to Iyer for his selfish batting..,10
Just get to 170 atleast,3
[removed],31
Never seen such a cheeky hulk,6
Stoinisssssss,5
Stoinis you cheeky brat,4
Lol he got away with it again,6
"So DC were 90+ in 10 overs without a wicket, nice.",2
Woooot,1
Fuck thank you stoin,4
"Marcus ""Lucky"" Stoinis",0
Hazelbad,3
It would be fun if CSK opened the batting with Curran as a pinch hitter,5
[deleted],12
This is what iyer kept us from experiencing,10
Go Marky Go Marky GO GO GO !!,5
wtf is happening,5
Stoinis big brain blinding Dhoni,8
"Styris' prediction was on point!

'Thats why you bowlers are so dumb. We can pick you like a dirty nose'",20
Dhoni🤦🏻‍♂️,2
See pant ? Even when you play ugly shots make sure the ball goes to the boundary,13
Lmao dude running sideways in the pitch,5
Should have unleashed the hulk earlier,3
Has been unlucky there Hazelwood. The figures won't show it but he's already been a vast improvement over Ngidi.,22
Jeez. Stoinis was 4-5 overs late,12
Stonis with 4 digit IQ moves.,17
Remember Iyer dropped Agarwal last game too. Stoinis has been covering his ass.,8
Stoinis needs to come before Iyer.,5
Make Stoinis the captain of DC. What luck!,6
How did stoinis suddenly become a God??,30
[removed],33
NGl Stoinis is hot,11
"It's not necessarily that DC batted bad, but I think CSK is bowling too well in the death overs. Iyer has to do better though.",8
That's how you play when you have so many wickets in hand.,6
What a fluke,0
man now it's almost 180 ffs,1
Par score - What do you think?,1
Stoinis is a beautiful man,4
4D chess by stoinis,1
176 to win. May be 10 runs short?,2
"predicted the score :D

[175](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/izi98o/-/g6je931)",4
25 short.. yup.,4
Curran the most economic bowler,6
Do you all think csk bowled well? I didn't get to see their bowling,2
Is Stonis still taking team bus back to his Hotel or he just rides on his luck ?,10
Delhi missing out on Stoinis master-class due to Pant selfishly trying to get a not out to boost his average,-7
DC shat their bed after 12th over,3
"Chennai doing field lapses all over the game

Dhoni as always finishing in style in penultimate ball",1
fuck that's good bowling from boomers,6
Pant looks sore,2
51 runs in last 5 is decent effort by csk,5
Hazlewood bowled well,3
"Not to make everything about RCB, but this death bowling overall has been so much better than what we saw yesterday",8
Made less in second half than in first half smh,6
That 19th over though,6
"Deserved 190, but 175 is defendable",6
This is how much RCB should've restricted KXIP to last night.,3
Inb4 Murali Vijay gives up his wicket in the first over.,4
Still decent bowling by Hazelwood. 7 economy is pretty decent for a T20,4
Hazelwood great performance tonight,3
This was so poor. Why the fuck did you even give CSK a chance when you could have got to 200!,5
Am i the only one? Or Did the bowlers stop using yorkers in IPL?,3
Only 2 sixes in the innings,2
Sam Curran can do nothing wrong,12
I'll take that. Brilliant from SCurran.,5
[removed],26
"Curran + Hazlewood going for 55 runs off their 8 overs. Bowling the toughest powerplay + death overs

That's unbelievably impressive",13
"They're at least 15 short there. They should've had more considering they only lost 3 wickets. Also, Hetmyer as the bigger hitter should've batted above Iyer tonight.",7
Holy fuck stoinis got 3 ball edged why this sub praising him,9
Fungus causes sex in bed guys,2
How many minutes is the innings break?,3
Holy fuck stoinis got 3 ball edged why this sub praising him,10
CSK can't bowl Jadeja full time. Play Kedar ffs. 2 overs each of Kedar and Jadeja.,0
Will DC be able to defend it? Hope they don't fuck up,4
"It's an in between score , Chennai would have to bat well to chase it.
Can't take delhi attack lightly.",3
"175 is a respectful score. Could have DC done better, probably. Credit needs to be given to the bowlers too.",3
Iyer now needs to pray that Vijay plays a similar innings like his.. which he can very well do.,4
That’s 15 short of where they should be,3
My mom saw the score after 10 overs and now and she said they botched the innings after the start they had.,8
Meh innings from Iyer considering he came in a good situation. As a captain he should have sent in Stoinis at that point to accelerate.,8
"Pant has lost the hit-or-die attitude from last IPL due to high expectations. All four indian batsman have same problem

Maybe time to promote Stoinis, and give him license to hit.",5
15-20 runs short. But this is still a tough chase.,8
It was just for fun mate. Everyone knows who Dhoni is. But sure go ahead bully some stranger online.,1
"I will ask this again, why do people perform better when they leave RCB??",12
"Man I love Iyer but his innings slowed the momentum. 

This score is right there in CSK's zone. They are going to chase it down by last over. If DC has to win it, they would have to bowl out of their skins.",8
"Csk has big batting lineup. Unless DC bowlers bowl well enough to cause collapse, this match is not theirs",5
"What a player Curran is, still a decent score for Delhi.",11
Not going to be a cakewalk chase if vijay stays around for a few overs,9
"Despite the struggle, Pant scored at 148 strike rate",26
"If we don't take Vijay's wicket for 10 overs, we will compensate for the 25 runs.",9
DC better defend well now,5
"**Delhi Capitals**

88/0 in the first overs

87/3 in the last ten

Thanks to Shreyas Iyer's 22-ball 26 runs",10
No ethical bowler today smh,3
jadeja was far too expensive,2
"1 hour and 37 minutes is what it takes to bowl 20 overs.

Set it as a benchmark and force every team to finish it in this time!! Some team takes bloody 2 hours to bowl 20 overs.",8
"To all the Indian fans out there who are chutiyas, thanks a lot for ruining Pant and his attacking game.",5
"The reason why i believe CSK would win or emd up being the runner up this year is because of Sam Curran being the x factor. Same goes with SRH in 2016(Bhuvi), Kkr in 2014  and 2012(Uthappa and Narine). Teams will prepare for every player but that x factor will alwats mess you up.",5
"iyer bungled this. but also, ponting bungled this by sending iyer at that stage. 4 runs from curran death over is criminal.",13
Hmm. Given the start 200 would have been perfect. But they just slowed down when they needed explosion just like Rahul in last match.,3
Good news for DC is that tall fast bowlers bowling a good  line and length is the order of the day. Maybe Mishra can weave some magic as well.,5
"Christ, Darren Gough's acting skills are shite",3

"Everyone claiming that it’s some runs short. 

Now watch us struggle to even get 150.",13
Dugout is fun but missing a little banter sadly cos of Deano. I don't like indians on dugout coz there are serious not like fun . Who could add fun to dugout Danny Morrison?or any other name,1
"Too slow, 7 wickets left ain't gonna count for shit after 20 overs are done",10
Prithvi found the secret to anti ageing and all he does is put a hat on. 17 with a hat on 45 and divorced with it off,31
Didn't have a chance to watch the game. Never have I seen Pant not out with a strike rate of 140. What gives?,5
Not hitting much in last 2-3 overs will hurt Delhi. All defending game had at average 200 runs to defend so they are about 20-25 runs short.,5
Darren Gough and Shane Warne doing that advanced hair studio ad is both cringe and looks like an ad in a dystopian future society where AIs pretend to be human and take over the world.,11
"I hope Vijay fails again today, I'd rather have Gaikwad up on top when Rayudu returns again.",1
"Good comeback by CSK. There were at least 4 boundaries that should have been stopped. Chahar attempting to stop a four with his boot, Kedhar Jadhav stumbling over the ball, Sam Curran overthrow and the Stoinis leg bye. Let's see if it costs them.",4
I think csk would be pretty happy to contain them at 175 at one stage they looked like 190 bound,3
"Why on earth did Iyer came to bat?

His job is only when a wicket falls earlier, should have sent Heytmyer/Stoinis.",6
"Chennai is Pretty weak this time, their Batting and Bowling both look weak.


Having said that ,watch them chase this easily",-2
Thali dhobi captaincy brilliant.,-15
Rashid Khan bats better than Iyer in death overs.,6
Lord Iyer batting tuk tuk style despite have Hetty and Stoinis to come has cost them 20-25 runs. Also no bih acceleration from Pant.,2
DC the only team with no english guys?,5
Was there a nick? What are the commentators asking Junior Ravi Shasthri,3
Shiiiit they laid into Shaw about the edge lmao. Good poker face from him though.,10
WATSON IS GOING TO EXPLODE MARK MY WORDS.,7
Could have scored 10 20 runs extra but this will make a competitive chase unlike half hearted nrr stuff.,1
"Little bit disappointed by Delhi, aside from Curran bowling after the 10th over was pretty bang average after the 10th, missed plenty of full tosses and length balls. Still a par winning total based on previous games and they have the bowling to defend it but not the total you'de hope theyde get",1
"Prithvi Shaw:

>**There WAS? I don't?**

When asked about the edge with the biggest shit eating grin",42
Prithvi has been born with the same luck as sachin,6
"I really should grow up, but just can't stop laughing at Warne's lipgloss in that fucking hair advert. 

Oh, and Gough... looks like a spitting image puppet with gout.",8
"Sad that Ashwin isn't fit yet. I still believe the Indian team should not have dropped her from t20s, but unfortunately Indian cricket is averse to any even slightly unconventional idea and would never drop someone from ODIs and retain them in tests and t20",10
After his second over Someone let Sam know that Delhi is capital of India,28
"When CSK bats: why isnt Dhoni coming out?

When DC bats: why is Iyer coming out?",18
"**Sam Curran with his bowling so far IPL**

1/28(4) v MI

3/33(4) v ~~SRH~~ RR

1/27(4) v DC",28
"Why did pant say ""did it?"" I didn't hear what the commentators said lol?",2
Gentle reminder that csk failed to appeal for the out shaw out in 3rd ball,6
"This isn't the same Pant we have seen in last IPLs either. Congratulations guys we have finally made him a ""sensible player"".",8

Yo what sort of innings that. Started slow ended slow.,3
KP's face is brighter than my future,5
i really want to see rutu do something idk what he’s capable of,2
*MURALI* vijay gonna make Dc dance to his tunes,1
"Dhoni 🤝 Iyer 🤝 Kohli 

Very useful for their teams so far",11
Lol. Vijay is going to face two genuine quicks,8
"Pant and shaw both batted at sr 148. Kinda shows the problem, no acceleration.",2
"How is Avesh Khan? 
Don't remember his bowling.",2
So much sweat on kp's head is making me uncomfortable,2
"Vijay just needs a quickfire 24 off like 12, and he can get out also no problem. Just dont do a 21 off 21",7
Dhoni's catch was 🔥🔥🔥,11
Kaafi hagaad batting. DC got cucked.,3
"2 really good strokes in the offside by pant, did he hit any sixes tho?",3
Only three games in but jadeja going for 40+ thrice in a row is a worrying sign. Hope he pulls things back as early as the next match.,8

"**Scoring rates in the first ten overs and last ten overs vs CSK this season**

MI - 8.6 and 7.6

RR - 11.9 and 9.7

DC - 8.8 and 8.7",5
Shane Watson is really buff damn.,3
"Rabada, Nortje and Avesh are all genuine fast bowler. What's up with DC today? Might make it or break it.",3
Who is that fat fuck with the curly hair who's parading around as a CSK groupie? Is he some sort of official mascot?,1
English players have overtaken the IPL before they used to be scrubs like Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara,6
anrich sounds like a very german name.,2
Dhoni to open. Scenes.,3
"Conspiracy theory: Dhoni can accelerate whenever he wants, but is terrible at maths and can't admit to his team that he can't work out the RRR

So he just picks an arbitrary point near the end to start swinging and hopes for the best",75
wheres dube :(,2
Please go large Watto,2
Any update on Ashwin?,2

Excited to see misra jee today!,1

inb4 Vijay score 10(14),5
INTENT,0
shane watson looks like the cricket equivalent of gordon ramsey,7
Losing Raina also meant we lost a LHB,3
Pant played well. Iyer never really got going. Should have pushed the envelope more near the end.  175 seems like a good total.,2
CSK got this nice and easy... I'd be surprised if this goes beyond 18 overs.,2
What if today is Vijay's day,7
Murali Vijay's batting gives me depression,6
The wife of a CSK player needs to tell vijay to score 50+ for a chance w her. He'll do it,9
Vj looks in good nick,3
vee jay gonna score a quickfire 60 off 32 balls tonight.,5
I think last time M Vijay was good in t20 was in 2013,5
"Shit, I forgot DC has Rabada.",4
I'm pretty sure Vijay is looking for a comeback in the test team.,6
Well left 👏,7
Beautiful leaves from Vijay. Please 50 more of these.,6
Which position do you think Dhoni will come in to bat today?,2
Proper test leaves,2
Is Dhawan rocking the Kanye lenseless glasses,3

"If they don't lose a wicket in the first six, then CSK will win. Even if they score just 20 runs in the PP.",3
Look at those lovely leaves from Vj haters,2
Lol. Murali Vijay can’t even see the ball it seems.,3
2 back to back leaves. Test cricket at its best,3
Vijay getting his eye in for a 29 (53).,2
I think DC is 20 runs short by sending Iyer..Stoinis should have been sent to play most of the remaining balls,2
Dhawan’s sunglasses are another level,21
what the fuck is Dhawan wearing on his head,11
Beautiful leaves,2
Lol. Shikha Dhawan is an Instagram model.,3
You all jerks to be questioning the quality of these leaves.,3
Looks like a relatively new bat.,1
Hope Vijay can hang around at end of day 1,8
Dhawan with that Drug cartel boss energy,2
can vijay just hit his own wicket what a boomer,6
Dhawan about to go skiing,4
Just see off the first session without loss.,8
Dhawan pullin off a Ranveer singh,2
Why can't they drop Vijay and put rayudu/faf at the top. Then they have space to put someone better in the middle order.,1
Man dhawan is just bro material,13
Mooooli Vijay,3
Strike Rotation is so important. I thnk batsman think there are only 1s and 2s now.,0
"Rabada can bowl test match lines to get rid of Vijay instantly, but that would be counter productive for Delhi.",3
Dhawan wearing his daughter’s swimming glasses,7
My dad loves dhawan's glasses I am not even complaining.....we have agreed on something after 5 years,4
Everything looking piss coloured to Dhawan,8
Dhawan looking like your typical Delhi lad. Kaafi chutya!,1
Inb4 2(7),2
I'm having questions about keeping this flair after seeing those glasses.,10
Is dhawan wearing anti corona glasses?,9
Think Vijay needs Dhawan's glasses to hit the ball off the square,5
Give Kohli a pair he might be able to see the ball,1
"Leave the good balls, put the bad ones away. Ah.",4

Vijay is auditioning for his test match spot.,6

Dhawan dropped a blot after he got out. My man just chilling now!,3
Iyer be Wilding,1
Dc trying to do everything punjab did. The spinners are imp for them,1
Is this the same Vijay who scored a century in IPL a decade ago ?,6
Dhawan the type of friend everyone likes,4
M Vijay (talking  to himself) ''just need to survive this session and CSK can post a big score tomorrow'',3
i dunno why but seeing axar patel get hammered gives me immense satisfaction.,3
Dhawan seems like he lost his corona kit except the eye protection that he is wearing right now.,3
I miss Amit Mishra ji in the field.,0
Remember when Vijay used to captain for kxip,6
"What the fuck is that chant, sounds like a freaking cult prayer",8
Is the fake crowd singing,2

Don’t waste too many Rabada overs. No one else can bowl at the end!,3
"If axar patel is bowling, dhoni might even come in at 3",6

This is the chant from The Dark Knight ?,3
This might be a great move. Get rid of some spinner overs against Watson and Vijay starting their innings.,1
Ashwin fielding looks as natural as a giraffe on ice,4
what the hell is this crowd noise?,1
"While I want Delhi to win, I really really really hope it's not another close finish. Either win it by 20-30 runs or lose by the 17th over please I just want to have a peaceful night without needing a ventilator",1
What are the fake crowd saying?,2
India's best test player indeed.,2
Cult prayer on,2
Wtf is the fake crowd chanting,3
In all honesty I just want to see a new batsman with a technique as pleasing to watch as SRT. Shots nowadays don't seem so enjoyable probably because we are numb to them.,5
NRR game already on,1
Ffs stop that crowd chant!,4
Isn't this axar guy supposed to be bad?,1
"Not sure this was mentioned, Axar has dismissed Watson 5 times.",7
Who's performing an exorcism in the ground?,7
"Damn, whoever made all this footage from back when watto was in RR getting out to Axar

VIJAY IS THAT U?,2
this fake singing is fucking shit!,2

That fake noise must be fucking with the players,2
"And of course KP likes the swimming goggles. 

Why doesn't that surprise me lol.",4
"looks like a tough surface to bat on, damn",2
Why crowd noise is so high its irritating,2
Dhoni at 3 today. You heard it here first,1
Thalapathy vijay strikes,3
"Plizz Vijay, play well.",3
This fake crowd has gotten really annoying. I might prefer the annoying air horns.,2
Lol vijay jersey number is 1,1
Think that sounds was played to piss of Vijay,3
A run a ball 20s from Vijay is loading,2
"100SR reached, Vijay has done his part.",4

I really hope Gaikwad works out for us.,6

Is it just me or prithvi shaw looks like coach bewda?,3
Graduated from Virat’s school of catching,9
Delhi's fielding hasn't been great this year. Ponting needs to have a word with the boys.,1
nortje bowling some legit speeds rn.,3
shaw playing fair,3
How do you drop that ?,2
"lolol.. dropped Watson... 


Please unleash Watto!",5
Next India match 10 dropped catches,1
"Damn, Nokia is pretty good",2
CSK going to win,2
"Shaw put all cough syrup power in batting

So an obvious drop",1
Come on that should have been taken :(,6
Wasn’t Watto dropped when he scored a century last year?,4

My dad after seeing Prithvi Shaw.",2
"**Delhi Capitals' spinners have dominated Watson**

Axar Patel - 5 dismissals, SR 110.53

Amit Mishra - 6 dismissals, SR 116.18",3

KP has also dropped some sitters like that.,4
Gavaskar talking about the controversy lol,11
CSK playing for NRR again??,3
Goof bowling frrom Agent 3310,2

Shaw-Shane Redemption,8
This is RCB level shitshow by CSK,3
Drop the catch challenge running full flexed in ipl,9
I had gone to take a shit and I expected CSK to be 5-3 after 3 overs. This is better I guess? Idk.,9
Rabada would have taken that,5
Are there no one else to replace these two uncle openers? :(,10
Virat has one of the worst slip catching stats,2
Shaw is such a comically bad fielder jesus lmao.,10
Fucking hell that ball moved like a legbreak off the pitch,3
Sunny almost getting teary eyed explaining his comment.,16
Gavaskar senti ho gaya.,10
"Lmao, I got some angry messages when I said last match after shaw had dropped a catch that shaw is a terrible fielder.

There's no excuse really. Its not a talent thing - its an effort thing",3
Boomers playing test cricket. T20 is too modern for their liking,7
wtf is happening,3
Great over! Nortje should always get first over!!,5
Why the fuck iyer never wears cap? Not to ruin hairstyle?Lol,5
Rons,1
Gavaskar u gotta be kidding me,6

All that great, tight bowling going to waste by dropping that catch.",3

"It would be better clarification, if suni gavaskar spoke in english. Sunil Gavaskar ko hindi nahi aata hai.",3
Sunny G getting crucified even though he said nothing wrong or inappropriate. feelsbadman.jpeg,8
And an absolute shit shot gone for four :'),2
Has Avesh gotten fat? Remember him being fairly lean or am I thinking of someone else?,2
36 in powerplay seems good,3
Were there any chants for DC in the last overs of their innings?,1
Pretty tight bowling imo,2
Avesh gonna undo all the work now,3
Wtf who screamed,2
"Wtf is going on with Iyer this match? 
4 different bowlers for 4 overs.. unexplainable",3
One thing I really want is Delhi not to bowl no balls which CSK did really well.,1
Sad Rabada noises...,2
[deleted],7
Avesh khan looks trash to me... Fat neighborhood boy running in to bowl is not scary. It's what I would want after 3 quiet overs.,-3
If for nothing else I think fitness and fielding is the reason Gill will go further than Shaw.,1
Dhoni is having an orgasm seeing Watson's SR,5
[removed],-2
This is the one match where avesh plays for us every year lol.,2
where is sunny g putting his foot in his mouth?,1
How tf is Watson so fragile when he's built of pure muscle?,3
CSK making the chase interesting for Piyush chawla ..,2
"Powerplay: Exists 

Csk: No",8
Why do teams still buy Vijay. Guy was too slow for tests.,4
nortje looks like Henry cavil from mission impossible,2
"In the absence of Ngidi, Watson has assumed 'nipple duty' for Chennai. 8/10",7
"I swear I've seen this CSK innings before. Openers will plod along, Faf will score some runs but not at a quick enough rate, SCurran and Jadeja will get promoted to hit big and then Dhoni will hit three sixes in the last over and finish with 35 (30). 

Delhi will win by 15 runs",13
"Shaw looks so lousy and lethargic, can he even pass the yo-yo test",5
What in the world are they trying to do ಠ_ಠ,1
Anyone knows why Watson's helmet has a black brim?,2
I can't believe I'm saying this after last season but when is Rayudu coming back? Dude looked primed for this season.,3
Shaw seems to have received a demotion to 3rd man.,1
Oh so that's where my child's play sunglasses are...,1
wow that was a choice of eyewear dhawan actually made,1
Rotating the strike well. Right-Right combo must be annoying to the bowlers.,5
What are those sunglasses Shikhar?,-1
[deleted],3
Kholis and gavaskar should have sorted it out in private but making public post was wrong on anuska part.,4
Damn,1
Is Dhawan planning on going skiing later?,2
Avesh is Trash,2
Avesh Gone!!!,2
"4 bowlers in 4 overs , wtf is DC doing?",9
there we go,1
Nope. Sorry. Avesh is another Umesh. Don't wanna see him bowling in another match.,3
Upvote if you're still fuming at just how terrible Iyer was today,1
Avesh khan might be the umesh yadav DC never needed,9
Dropped watson and now gonna pay for it,2
Watto <3,2
"This is what DC lacks, players like Watson who can go berserk when set. There's Stoin but he's too low down.",5
How much do you think the commentators hate saying these random sponsors every time a batsman hits a 6?,9
Go fetch that Shaw!,2
I know a lot of people think Dhoni backing Watto isn't the right call but I remember in the 2018 season Watto was struggling at the beginning of the season and Dhoni backed him to open and Watto then scored a ton and then another one. Murli on the other hand desperately needs to go. Really need someone else there instead of Murli.,9
I was right when I said he's your fat neighborhood boy bowling trash.,7
Dubai DJ is far better than Abu Dhabi DJ,2
Didn't KP say this pitch would be a dream for seamers? 175 on seamer-friendly pitch seems pretty good,1
"Bring back DLF maximums smh

At least that kinda sounded decent",13
Anybody know how long rayudu is out for?,2
Fucking called it. I am sick and tired of this man. We drop him every game and he fucking rips us apart after that.,6
lol.. almost 6 RPO,3
One day Virat will be old and doing telepathic commentary with virtual reality streamed games. Pro users will be able to access Commentator stats along with their essays of their analyses beamed to your brain via Neuralink. Some twitter user will figure out that Virats heartbeat increases when he sees a particular young player and not for others. This will lead to big pushback because it will indicate that Virats heart beat faster only for one player and in this gender fluid society it will be called as mental sexual thought crime. Virat will be arrested and sent to Mars.,20
How old is avesh?,1
good recovery over,2
"rip anvesh bowling figures, if he has to bowl 4",3
We will need to protect Avesh. He looks like easy 40-50 runs off 4 overs.,7
Just 12 off that. I'll take that from avesh anyday,3
I hope Anushka can understands that Sunny G wasn’t being sexist or anything.,3
Avesh is going to be that one token 50 run bowler today that every match is supposed to have this year in the IPL,3
"Watson can't hit express pace of Rabada and Nortje, can't play spin, ofc he's going to go after the medium pacer.",5
"Just curious, shreyas taking Ganguly name becomes matter of conflict of interest but not his endorsement of my11circle , why so ?",3
For all the people saying this is a shitshow in the powerplay by csk I just wanna say watto can take any bowling apart if gets in to his groove. Remember 2018 final,4
Easy win for CSK,2
Murali Vijay should retire,3
So why does this sub have a hate boner for Murali? Is it cause he stole DK's wife?,10
Calm down guys CSK gonna win it somehow,3
10 years back Vijay would have smacked that six,7

Lmao...shit gets wickets,6
How the fuck watto. You fuckin idiot!,6
oh fuck yeah,6
"Obligatory Axar getting Watto out , gg wp",8
Very very good catch.. good bowling and set up by Axar.,8
Motherfucker.,6
6th time for Axar!,6
Axar struck praise god,8
Watson is axars lil bitch ROFL,12
Axar got Watto's number.,10
"Thought Hetmyer made a mess of that tbh

Does well to hold on in the end",5
Fffs Watto. Just give yourself some time.,8
6th time axar gets Watson,8
How does Watson get out to this amateur,6
Dhoni innnnn,4
Axar's official bunny,5
Ahhh 8 times out of 10 it would have disappeared to the stands,3
"Yes yes yes! Let’s gooooo!

So glad we got Watto. He is our kryptonite.",2
That Axar move was good captaincy by Iyer,3
"Man Axar getting wickets, Dube is best bowler, Sundar is highest scorer. What else we will see?",3
Watson is axar's bunny,2
MSD MSD MSD MSD,1
And that is 6 dismissals for Axar vs Watson in the IPL,2
it’s fine now faf can do some work,1
"**4.2** Patel to Watson, OUT,  **23-1**

SR Watson c Hetmyer b Patel 14 (16b 1x4 1x6) SR: 87.50",3
Inb4 Dhoni comes at 3,3
"Half tracker hit straight to the only fielder around for about 50 metres

Shit gets wickets",6
Axar has Watson's number,4
Hetmyer took a good catch last match too,3
"vijay: plays on the offside, ball goes legside",8
Hetmyer is just for clutch catches.,9
"Axar gets him again.

Good move by DC.",4
It's the same story with our openers,1
Fafda time,1
Who gonna tell Murali this is not a test match.,4
"Finally, our specialist quota of thicc ass fielder holding onto one",5
"See? You need Vijay to hold one end down... Do not get out vijay

No bias i promise",12
Lmao Axar gets him again,5
Axar now dismissed Watson 6th time in IPL,9
Bunny,7
So matchup stats actually useful?,6
"Csk needs new blood , lockdown have taken toll on oldies.",3
Hetmeyer just bounced there on the ground after taking the catch!,3
Slow timely death,1
Fuck,1
What position will Dhoni bat today? I am thinking 6,5
"Vijay clearly not the best partner for Watson, puts too much pressure on him to hit",7
Shane Watson getting out to left arm spinner since before I hit the puberty.,6
hope ruturaj comes to bat,1
Well atleast Faf has more time to control the show.,1
Fuck sunil gavaskar has entered eng com. He will probably start with clearing the controversy here.,5
Who want to bet on Dhoni at 7 again,4
Just realised that we will have a formidable bowling unit once Ashwin and Ishant come back.,12
CSK are waiting for new retires to buy in next yrs auction.,13
I don't think watson can wait till the knockout matches to start playing! CSK might not make there without their spinners playing,5
I cant belive Watson is a bunny for a bowler like axar just 2020 things,5
"Why would someone be looking for a bottle opener inside the fridge? Get a grip, Kingfisher",7
"That was Hetmeyer not Shaw my dear Watson, he doesnt drop them.",4
Faf V rabada pleasee,6
Axar Patel is low key vital for Delhi!,6
Who was that cuck shitting on Axar,4
Vijay has Dhoni's nudes.,11
"Btw, what the fuck happened to Avesh Khan? He was gun in Ranji Trophy last season - both in terms of his pace and fitness. 

Today he's turned up like Manpreet Gony.",5
They are wasting Ruturaj by playing him in the middle order. Should be opening instead of VJ.,5
Vijay looks set for 24(24),9
Axar Getting Fat year by year,1
Bowl Mishi an over next,3
Don’t really fully understand why Chennai are on their third and several teams have played only 1,14
"Axar has now got Watson out 6 out of 8 times.

Watson is Axar's 🐰",7
Problem with Chennai is that their older guns barely play cricket outside of IPL. That’s not something you’d want from your players. Dhoni should be allowed to become a t20 mercenary now for the next couple of years for his career.,3
Csk: our fans deserve a better match. Drag this to 100 in 36 then chase it in 5 overs,8
How i wish it was Vijay who got out instead of Watoo,12
Both VJ and FAF are slow starters.,3
Get an over out of Avesh now!,5
Madhuri dixit still thicc,10
I don't know much about Indian domestic cricket but isn't Gaikwad an opener?,1
"CSK both openers seems to be out of touch , lacking confidence and out of form.

Maybe the weakest opening pair in this year's ipl ?",7
I want Dhoni to open in the next match,2
Dinesh Karthik condemns bringing players’ wives in players performance discussion.  Murali Vijay vehemently disagrees.,7

Damn Madhuri looks so fucking pretty!,5
Axar in the IPL >>>>>>> Jadeja,13
Get faf next and it's done. Without Raina this CSK team isn't that threatening.,2
Vijay is living out his dream of playing in a day-night test match.,9
"Should've kept Avesh on imo

Sneak a cheap ish over out of him",1

Has Graeme Smith and Shane watson ever opened for Rajasthan together? I need to know this for a bet with my friend,2
Why is Nortje pronounced like Nokia? Seems wrong,2
Yes let’s bowl Nortje against Faf who plays him everyday instead of getting an over out of Avesh.,4
Sex shot,2
Fap to plessis,7
Faf to bring it home as usual. No real surprises there.,3
why're they bowling nortje to faf? surely he's played him in the nets a lot.,0
Ok ok I get it; back the player (Watto)  he will give you results in finals. But atleast take in a guy who can take you to final. Pls remove this vijay,6
"**Bowlers to Dismiss Watson most times in IPL**

Mishra - 6

Axar - 6*

Jadeja - 5

Narine - 4",3
"It might've worked in 2018 but now we seriously need new players. Players like Vijay, Kedar & Watson shouldn't be made to play",4
"By batting slow , CSK has effectively made this like a 200 run / 10 RPO run chase from here on.

Taking it deep ?? Hell yeah.",6
I know its negative but I'd rather get Vijay out and Sam in so that Sam has more time to settle and get set. A set Faf and Sam partnership would be incredibly destructive.,7
Nortje runs like what I imagine if we trained a robot to bowl and it was pretending to be human but at the same also robot,5
Faf gonna out score Vijay in half the balls smh,2
"need to get faf quick, he's man in form",4
"Nortje should be pronounced as ""Nort-Jay""",1
Faf is CSK MVP for the last two seasons for me personally.,1
CSK couldn't get a better openor than Vijay? Where does Rituraj normally bat?,3
This is dumb captaincy to not get an over out of Avesh.,1
"Raina's absence is hurting CSK, Faf has no support.",11
Why not bring rabada when the man in form is new on crease?,1
Come on DC,5
That should have been a 2. too slow!,1
Du plessis in splendid form,5
Mishra gonna be trump card with 80m long boundaries,8

Opts out from batting.",14
It’s actually sad watching Vijay play,11
Don’t bowl SA bowlers against Faf unless needed. It’s pretty simple really.,1
"Murli can barely field, barely hit the ball and can't bowl. There are no wives left to steal as they're all matured Dads so what is he in the playing 11 for ?",21
START HITTING VIJAY YOU DAFT CUNT,1
Fake noise cheering a mistimed short to mid on from vijay like he just hit a six.,6

I wonder if Nortje gets complaints directed towards Nokia on his Twitter/FB/Insta page.,4
Oh thank God,1
"FUCKING FINALLY, FUCK OFF YOU LIL FUCK",5
Vijay is embracing his inner dhoni,2
Yay...Vijay gone....who cares...,2

Cheers Murli. As expected.,2
Drop Vijay,3
"You just lost the match DC, you idiot",4
"Should have dropped it, tbh.",4

"Ah shit, that's gonna hurt us",1
Blessing in disguise for CSK,3

Why would you take murli Vijay ka catch wtf. He was helping DC for so long.,3

Sunny looks so uncomfortable,5
Vijay is so past it now,8

CSK fan : Yesssssssssss,1
Vijay show alright tonight. I am sure he is a quota player for CSK.,3
what did Faf go and tell Vijay,2
veejay is so bad omg,2
Vijay is completely useless,3
Shit! Why would you dismiss Vijay :(,6
Pant is really good against pacers,1
Vijay didn't fill his role of 100SR today. This is not looking good.,3
Why are they celebrating?,7
Vijay ne apni team ko parajay se bacha lia .,3
"Lmao, why are you guys celebrating a Murli Vijay wicket

You should cry your tits out",6
Vijay getting out has done more good for csk than dc,6
Yo yo yo yo it's that time of the match 😎,3
Vijay looks like he doesn't even want to be there!,3
Thank goodness he's gone,2

*But anyway...*",10
Well next match we know who Rayudu will be replacing now.,5
Why Vijay why.,4
"Dear Vijay, you go only play FC cricket.",1
Why did Nortje do that?,3
Vijay plays as if he's forced to play cricket. He must be glad he's out.,6
No way Murli Vijay can handle 145 kph balls at this stage of his career.,5
"IF HE GETS ANOTHER GAME, PLS KILL ME.",5
DC fans mad about taking this wicket,2
"why are they talking about Gavaskar's muscles, did Kohli challenge him to fight",9
Oh no.,2
CSK might as well have tried out some other random Indian youngster instead of Vijay,4
"Nortje is absolutely on song today, him and Rabada at the death can be such a deadly combo",4
"The most enjoyable part of IPL for hundreds of millions is a quickfire 35\* (13), but for me and the many back home in Pakistan, it's that Dhoni 8\* (11). That one brings me joy.",2

Thank God. He won't be in the next match.,5

time to promote FAF in opening slot for CSK,3
I wish my boss gave me as many chances as dhoni gives vijay.,2
"r/Cricket: Vijay is trash...100 SR is pathetic

Vijay: How about 66?",5
Munni VJ shouldn't even be in the 25 man squad,2

"Tbh if they get faf cheaply, Delhi's game to lose",1

Well at least vijay has dks ex wife.,-3
Gaikwad - please grab this golden chance dude!,1

Such a blunder from dc",1

"opportunity for highly rated Ruturaj gaikwad

Is Mishy bhai wearing a toupee?,2
VJ jus playing for the other team at this point,6
Iyer DE...,2
Mishras hair looks... weird,3
Feel like this is the time to send curran in? Have him tonk a quick 20 and lower the rr a bit.,1
Every time I've seen Murali bat this IPL I get traumatic flashbacks to when Upul Tharanga played his test match innings in the 2011 World Cup.,3
I wish i was as persistent and CSK is with Vijay,7
Our odds of a win are inversely proportional to the time Vijay spends at the crease. Him and Jadhav don't deserve a place in any team. Just give chance to some youngsters so that we might have a better team next year atleast,5
SMH Pant don’t get my hopes up,4

"CSK, please feed gaikwad.",5
"One of my favs., Mishraji. Never got his proper due in the national team.",6
Get rid of Avesh+Stoinis overs (3 left),5

Funfact: Mishra ji is a milkman's son. His fingers became really good milking cows and buffaloes daily from 3 am to 6 am. Somebody saw the potential and got him into cricket and made him a spinner. We need a Bollywood film on this.,9
I have a feeling that Gaikwad would do well and Vijay would be dropped for good. No wait... it's not feeling as much as hope.,1
Amit Mishra is my spirit animal.,1
Did not recognize Mishraji with his hairpiece until his name came up on the graphic.,2
"Mishraji when asked who Delhi Capital's most underrated cricketer is:

Gaikwad is giving me all sorts of anxiety.,5
Props to Vijay for seeing out those tricky early overs and taking the shine off the new ball.,6
Mishra's toupee looks unnatural what happened did he get a low bid in the IPL draft,7
Is Faf going to have to be a one man army again?,9
This kid Gaikwad looks like he is devoid of any confidence right now. I hope he spends some time at the crease to get it back.,6

My first seeing Gaikwad bat.,1
The crowd noise is just so fucked up. No rhyme or reason to it.,4
Watching Amit bowl reminds me of that famous Reddit comment from a thread last IPL- Just because you’re fat doesn’t mean you’re a good spinner. Don’t remember who said it but it was epic!,5
Scenes if they keep playing for NRR and forget to actually win the matches whole season.,4
"Can you imagine being Narayan Jagadeesan? 448 runs @ 64.00 in the TNPL last year and consistent run-accumulator for TN for close to 3 years, only to get cucked in the CSK XI by a 36-year-old Murali Vijay who hasn't been relevant in T20 cricket for almost 7 years.",7

Gaikwad looks so nervous,3
How is mishra looking younger than Chawla ?,2
Should have brought Jadhav or Jadeja at 4,1
csk ya mishra - who is more slow?,2
Mishraji grew a lot of hair during lockdown :),3
What’s the deal with this Gaikwad kid? Talented wonderkid or making up the numbers?,2
Is it only me or does anyone get the feeling that L Siva has a really bad cold. His voice sounds so different.,1
FFS guys. Calm down.,2
"Required run rate of 11.59 in the 9th over, you love to see it",7
Bring Rayudu Raina for Vijay Gaikwad and you got a solid team.,1
But but...the dew..,4
Is that Mishraji's real hair? Wasn't he losing hair a couple seasons ago?,5
Gaikwad looks absolutely clueless. CSK really couldn't find any better Indian youngster? We didn't even spend all our money in the auction ffs.,2
Wtf pant,8
Piyush's beard became grey after than Sanju Samson over,9
What is the quantum of loss meme,1
Is this Slats and Nicholas on comms? What a duo these two are pure entertainment,1
Pant getting an orgasm,22
Is dhoni still looking to bat at 7 or he already left for hotel,7
Goddamn Rishab go easy on the drugs,18
Dafuq was this pant 😂,13
bois the heart attacks have been real,5
Wtf is Pant doing behind the stumps lmao,8
Woohoo... Dhawan ma boi,3
no need to panic for CSK but they have to start believing they can win and right now it seems they believe game is done,2
Mishra is the best Indian leg spinner after Kumble.  Don’t @ me,1
Shit who drove over Pant there?,5
Pant is jizzing his pants after every ball,10
Chawla or mishra who looks more like a pedo?,0
Pant and Dhawan are such Delhi dudes!,6
Dhoni is having a second orgasm by seeing Ruturaj's SR,6
ooowwoowowo,4
Csk has never finished 7 or 8th right ?,3
Pant raping my ears,6
"Lol.

Mishraji looking younger !!,3
Watch chennai win this match too out of nowhere.,5
Mishra Ji is nailing it today,3
Somebody tell Pant that people can hear his sound.,14

Pant is such a mic whore!,15
"just tuned in

RIP ears for those who are wearing headphones 😂,15
Here before MSD plays at strike rate 69.0,5
There is a voice artist job for Pant somewhere.,16
Yo wtf pant,10

Faf is bamboozled by Mishra's bowling or toupee,2
[deleted],2

Gotta play for NRR plzzz,0
wtf is that fkin wheezing sound,5
8D Chess by CSK. Making the RRR out of control so Dhoni will smash from ball 1,12
Shut up Pant xD,2
This is perfectly setting up a Curran 101* (40),15
Pant.exe stopped working for a moment there.,22
Lmao pant squealing behind the stumps there,12
Was that pant 'hoohoo' ing?,22
Why do they need that fake crowd noise when Pant is around?,54
"Alright Rishab, keep it in your pants.",11
"CSK is taking ""Taking it to the deep"" way too seriously",4
welp chennai lost gg,6
Wtf are those glasses Dhawan. Can he even see with those?,8
Pant sounds like a cartoon character,5
Wtf pant stfu,4
Told ya...Dhawan is on acid... tripping,7
Fleming in the timeout: Once again I'm asking for your intent.,14
"You can make fun of Mishra's hairstyle.. But, he has been outstanding for us for such a long time.. always gives his best.",5
csk should have bowled kedar instead of jaddu,4
This is just sad to watch,2
Pant was giving a mating call to someone there,8
pant testing his vocal chords on the stump mic i see,4
Damn this is some tight bowling,6
Why so slow?,3
Tf is going on here wow,1
Ffs someone mute the microphone for me,6
OCF Spike,1
Pant is actually gold behind the stumps. His chat is so shit it's entertaining.,15
CSK playing a truly Dhoni innings.,3
Pant making noises like i do on bed.,6
we need rayudu real bad,3
Nice to see them playing for net run rate.,3
Sam Curran to score 50 off 20 and calm things down for CSK.,3
Pant having massive orgasm behind wickets,6
I want 20 overs of legspin every inning.,2
Chad Mishra boning hotties by night and spinning circles by day,6
Ohhhh no they're struggling ooof,1
How is this a t20?,2
I want someone to make a compilation video of all Altroz clips of this IPL and then upload it on pornhub. These commentators gonna love it,3
We still living in the quantum of loss mentality Bois.,3
Pant sounds like Tom from tom and jerry getting a whack on his ass,2
Dhawan wearing the 3d glasses,4
"I hope CSK loses this match and the next, forcing them to do something different.",2
No points for guessing who's moaning in the stadium with their **ooooohohohohohooohhhhoooo yeeeeaaaaa**,10
Wish this was a zoom chat and we could mute pant,3
Mishra is spinning the ball unlike the others. Turn csn be lethal even if the ball is slow. Almost did Faf there.,4
"I cant watch this, please help",8
"This Vijay is, may Allah forgive me, even worse than an Alb*nian",7
Iyer lost his shit hearing Pant lmao,3
"Mishra ji is an IPL legend. 157 wickets at an economy of 7.3. Also, has taken the highest number of hat tricks in IPL history.",8
This CSK team is not the same without Raina,9
"Murali stealing batting spot from a good batsman in the csk line up, just like he stole ...",7
Delhi gotta pull out an RCB masterclass to lose today,4
नौजवान Amit Mishra,3
Why does cricket match bot have RCB flair,5
Csk gotta attack that Avesh dude,5
Gaikwad has the nervousness of Micheal Hussey and batting prowess of Murali Vijay 😂😭,11
"Still 3 overs left from Rabada, this is gonna be an incredibly hard chase",4
"CSK batting looks awful. Had Shikhar taken Faf's catch match would have been over. As things stand faf needs to pull the rabbit out of the hat for winning this.

Edit: ok that was not a dropped catch.",2
Pant making sure people don't fall asleep watching this snoozfest.,11
Hoping for a CSK collapse under 100 runs,1
"I don’t know why Delhi doesn’t play three spinners Ashwin, Mishra, Axar and two fast bowlers. Axar and Ashwin can both bowl in the power play.",2
Brohit is the best actor in these Dream 11 ads,17
Only sam curran special save csk now,5
Seems like Mishra ji was treated by Dr Batra,4
Time for quantum of loss,6
Mishra ji ne dil jeet liya ❤️,2
"If cricketers were in the apple ad -

Pandya : Mein 10 baar karke aaya aaj ( I did it 10 times today)

Rohit : sabse accha vada pav kidhar milega dubai mein ? ( Where to get the best vada pav in Dubai ?)

Kohli : Biwi se acchi bowling kaise karvaye ? ( How to make your wife bowl better?)

Dhoni : Apni kamzori chupane ke naye bahane (New ways to hide your weakness?)",8
"Delhi gotta find a place for Mishra even after Ashwin returns. He's been outstanding for them every year. Not afraid of being hit, always goes for wickets.",6
"I like pant's constant shitscreems. We haven't had a vocal wk in like forever, would like something thats not boring like dhoni",2
Josh take notes! That’s how you know there’s a keeper,3
No hope for CSK left,1
Can we get Manoj Tiwary or someone in for Raina? Can surely do better than Vijay,1
"Gaikwad is huge disappointment, probably going to be one of those domestic batsman who can’t bring their game to the top level",6
10 crucial runs in last 3 overs... CSK is accelerating way too early,6
So - 12 RRR. do we give up now?,6
How's the match going? Have been disconnected for like 30 mins,5
Delhi should do anything to prevent Ruturaj from getting out,4
Gaikwad already giving me Dhoni level anxiety.,5
Gaekwad should open and Vijay should be benched if Rayudu comes back. Gaekwad is atleast a youngster. Vijay is way past his prime.,3
What happened to those Aparajith twins for TN aren't they good enough for the IPL,5
CSK loses no problem but if Dhoni comes next that should be enough for CSK fans to look forward to this season.,2
Only shivaji rao gaikwad can save CSK,3
Gaikwad is the latest recruit from the aam admi quota,4
Seems the whole CSK team look up to Dhoni so much that they're all looking to emulate the way he batted against RR,6
CSK are doing well and will comfortably chase down the target of 110,4
"Things lined up so awfully for CSK, Vijay had to face the pace of Rabada and Nortje, and Du plessis has to face the spinner onslaught. Should've opened with Du plessis maybe to make something out of the powerplay.",5
Really need Mishra ji and Ashwin bowling from the two ends. Hopefully DC try that out in the future.,3
"  Vijay - Batting Impact in the IPL  

2009 - 2013 (CSK) : -1.5 

2014 (DD) : -6.2 

2015 - 2016 (KXIP) : +0.2 

2018 - 2020 (CSK) : -3.2  

Vijay is having a horrid run for CSK since returning to the setup in 2018 

&#x200B;

CC: Cricviz",5
"Watching csk is so frustrating. If it was the KKR like chase, I would turn off the TV and do something else. But this just gives me anxiety.

I like test matches. They are calm and serene environment. But the dot balls here makes me wanna shout why am I torturing myself watching this.",6
Gone,1
Well fuck fuck fuck,1
"Match day mania by Swiggy is the greatest thing ever. Once you get hooked, you're ordering Swiggy every day of the week.",4
Required rub rate is 12.,5
What was that?,4
Gone,3
NICE,2
FUCK FUCK FUCK.. unnecessary shit... WTF,4
Rabada has 3 overs. rip.,3
This explains why Iyer and pant were slow in the middle overs,7
Gaekwad lmao,3
that’s out,3
This kid is not made for IPL I feel.,6
"Duscoop, lol.",4
The only batsmen I fear in that csk lineup is Curran tbh,8
Du Plessis struggling with timing😪,4
"As a long time CSK supporter, I gotta say, we look lost this season. Bhajju pa left us, Raina left, Rayudu is unfit and Dhoni is playing like he's playing international cricket instead of IPL. Chance of us even reaching anywhere near the finals is very slim",21
Don't know if they wanted that wicket tbh,3
This is good for the team. Can get Curran or Jadeja out now to hit.,5
"Lol.. CSK has completely lost it..

Will Dhoni come out now?",6
" The next passage of 3-4 overs holds the key for CSK, let's see what happens",3
That was painful,4
Please send Jaddu next.,3
Kaun leke aya re isko?,1
This dude can’t catch a break!,7
Amazingly calm runout.,2
Bad move to get him out.,3
Gaikwad is not able to handle the pressure he is in,5
Axar is good,1
Gaikwad was probably asked to sacrifice his wicket by the team,4
Time for Samuel 16(5) Curran,1
Kinda wish it was Faf out but works,5
"CSK's indian backups are shit. No Raina and Rayudu, and you literally can't find a bloke to replace them",4
CSK are fucked without Raina.,4
What's the approach gonna be today? QoL or try to win?,1
Gayak just couldn't get his wad swinging today.,1
"Lol Gaikwad absolute shit, has no patience at all",2
Rishabh so quick there.. Lovely to see,4
Good. Get Sam in. I want to see someone swing the bat no matter the result.,2
Just get Chawla in already,1
Boomer 3rd umpire,1
Dhoni is going to come now,1
Poor guy should have batted at the top in the power play.,3
Everybody writing CSK off forgetting whom they are playing against. Guys we are chokers of death over both in batting and bowling.,6
MSD next?,3
Good guy Akshar Patel saving umpire's work.,3
Gaikwad beta tumse na ho payga,4
Teams be getting debutants like Devdutt Padikkal and we be getting Gaikwad,10
Yo thala is in boys,1
Time to take a short run jab,1
I screamed out loud and my dad was on an important call lmao,3
Out comes Dhoni now and smashes the living bejeezus out of DC. Good luck DC.,0
Lmao that was FAF plan? Lmao he did it intentionally  to put that kid out of his misery 😂😭,14
Wow. Just wow,2
CSK losing the plot,2
In before Dhoni doesn't come out at 7....but at 8.,10
"Csk be like

Win every toss, choose to field

Bowl shit n leak runs in field

Open with Murali vijay n play for NRR",9
PLEASE DONT SEND KEDAR I CANNOT TOLERATE MORE ANXIETY,10
"I feel bad for Faf, the guy deserves a quality partner",2
Oh no why is ruturaj like an hyperactive kid?,3
"Man, the lack of Raina in this team is really showing",6
Why no Karan Swamy :(,0
Jadhav in lololololol,6
"Guess, now we know why Gaikwad was not sent in as an opener.",2
"Drop this kid and play Shardul lol, at least he can hit a few clutch boundaries and bowl as well.",3
Two back to back bad wickets for DC,2
I absolutely hate CSK but feel bad for the man!,9
ffs what shit umpiring is this smh,1
"this kid cant handle the pressure   
Sad way to go out",6
Gaekwad was hyped before this IPL as a good replacement for Raina. He looks crappy and out of his league.,6
"**9.1** Patel to du Plessis, OUT, do we have a run-out here? Yes we do **44-3**

RD Gaikwad run out (&dagger;Pant/Patel) 5 (10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00",3
Iyer getting Axars overs quick before Dhoni comes to the crease,2
This dude unlucky af!,13
Shit he looked so sad. Poor guy,7
"never thought I'd utter these words ever in my lifetime



>we're greatly missing rayudu at 4.  at fkin 4, yea 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️",9
Grave mistake by Delhi running out Ruturaj,6
Perfectly set up for a 15-run loss for CSK with Dhoni scoring 30-odd runs.,6
"I have never heard of Gaikwad before , I don't think I will be hearing of him after this season",5
i feel bad for gaikwad. bad luck man.,4
Dhoni hiding YOU LOVE TO SEE IT,2
Chennai Giveup Kings,7
Ffs Sam is supposed to come in now. Faf and Sam is the partnership that needs to take this innings anywhere near the total. Jadhav is just going to do the same as all before him so far.,4
15(25) from Vijay and Gaikwad. Amazing. Watson got 14(15) not great but not terrible. What is going on?,4
"Fucking Jadhav, we are fucked",8
"Ravi bishnoi 2 match 4 wickets 

Padikkal 2 match 1 50+

Gaikwad 2 match 2 strange dismissal",3
Oh lawd it's jadhav now,4
This is the perfect time for Dhoni to have got in...,1
"Gaikwad looks too nervous, is he even quality as they say",1
"12.18 is the run rate and CSK show no urgency   
god this is just torturous",4
Almost feel bad for Gaikwad. Guy’s had the worst start to his IPL career.,5
Why is Jadhav coming out,5
well that could well be his last game this year.,3
Starting a go fund me for Gainwad blindness fund,4
We had a friend named Ruturaj whom we called 1.41Raj,1
Gaikwad is gonna have a Pant PTSD,5
"This innings is so disappointing to watch. When they know already that Vijay is really slow at runs, why would they put him in the beginning. Why didnt they send in Sam Curran instead or anybody else stronger? Anybody feels like something is fishy?",1
Jadhav here to play a test knock,1
"#DAD BOD XI

Rohit
  
Shaw
 
Tiwary 

Sarfaraz 

Pollard

Dube

Jadhav 

Nikhil

Thomas 

Mishra 

Chawla",1
Gaikwad out advantage CSK once again,2
Sam Curran got punished for being naughty boy with those overthrows,6
come on dhoni. get out there and prove your doubters wrong.,3
Jadeja should learn bowlin from Axar now. Lockdown has taken a toll on him.,1
That dude deserved to get out,2
"Just checked in, did I miss anything??",1
Mega Sloth Dhoni waiting for the req RR to go beyond 20,6
130 to get in 10 overs.,4
Ok why does Kedar Jadhav look like a buff midget version of Azhar Ali walking in lmao,3
Kedar Jadhav had a SR of 95 in IPL 2019. He's a bigger cuck than Vijay in this CSK lineup.,4
"This is so smart captaincy, the middle overs being bowled so quickly, and the spinners playing it to perfection. 


Of course everything can change, but good shit DC


Need to get FAF and Dhoni out",3
Almost forgot Jadhav played for CSK,1
Gaikwad is too anxious I guess and today's dismissal will definitely add to it,2
The last Jadhav's match winning innings I remember was in 2017 against Eng 😂😭,1
Akshar bowled beautifully tbh,3
They should let Gaikwad open the batting instead of Vijay,1
Axar finishing his quota before Thala Dhoni comes. Good from Shreyas when you consider what happened last year.,5
*It's like teams have forgotten how to chase at all*,7
CSK playing for NRR again?,5
Chasing in this IPL has been shambolic,5
"For fuck sake, is there no way CSK can chase high totals. It doesn't look possible with these batsmen",2
"Tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk",1
"Please come out to bat MS. And let us win the game.

Do your tuk tuk...increase RRR, put pressure on the non-strikers, and causing them to get out trying to hit out.

Do what you do for India and then hit 6s in the end so no one can blame you since your strike by the end of the game will be fine.

&#x200B;

Edit: Kedar came out to bat. Guess he won't come out to bat until the game is gone so he won't have to take the blame.",5
street smart at the crease boys,7
CSK what is you doing,5
Sad state of affairs this. Vijay is crap gaikwad struggling no raina missing bhaji and bravo watson getting out to a pull shot once again.....,2
CSK's batting just looks lacklustre without Rayudu. It's basically only FAF.,2
Gaikwad can be Chahal's body double if they ever make a movie on RCB or Chahal,7
CSKians shitting on axar patel at the beginning of the innings lol,15
Are chennai batting for reducing quantum of loss?,4
"Head over the ball, fully forward and loose hands. Perfect defence!",2
This CSK team is out of depth this year. Too many out of practice oldies well past their sell by dates.,3
Csk losing their shit without Rayudu,4
"When he is fit to play, nobody picks Rayudu. Everyone wants him once he gets injured. The irony of life",13
Jadhav's hamstring would go if they ran 3.,4
is this the net session that Dhoni wanted,6
"gaikwad needs those anxiety pills man,got lost there.",4
Aur defend karo BC,4
Solid 4.7 RR,4
Legit looked like faf was just done with the kid,6
CSK clearly planning to target Rabada for runs.,6
Du Plessis did one of those 80s Indian / Pakistan cricket team moves by running the bad batsman out on purpose.,9
Test cricket has begun,2
129 off the last 10. Nice little setup for Dhoni to finish it off in his trademark style.,3
Oh Dhoni where are thou ?,2
"Aw, was hoping for a Mishra roll.",5
4D chess by Dhoni to send Jadhav before him. Jadhav plays at a much worse strike rate and no blame on Dhoni,5
How did Mumbai lose to this team. I'd never know,3
No mishra Rolly Polly stop. I am sad,4
Axar Patel has bowled really well today and completed his quota too,1
why aren't dc using up khan's over? it's gonna be a nightmare to use him in the second half.,1
CSK playing a test match,3
"Are Murali Viay, Gaikwad, Jadhav all playing under some NREGA scheme?",3
Haven’t seen csk this sloppy before,2
Axar's bowling is the epitome of toit,1
"Gotta say, Fantastic work by Pant. Absolutely brilliant!",3
Lmao csk needed a thala masterclass and yall gonna get a kedhar 5(9),6
it's the *MISHRA SPRINT*,3
Nice defense kedarilidaran,1
Gaikwad looks like he could open,1
"Tbf to Gaikwad he's batting out of position for a misfiring CSK team

Not the easiest situation to be in when you're very inexperienced with the IPL",1
Axar 1-14 first match and 1-18 this match. Wtf dude!,2
"13 RPO. Welp, NRR it is again.",2
"Brilliant spell by Axar. Blink of an eye and it's over. Jaddu used to be like this. Maybe, a bit rusty.",2
Gaikwad IPL career over,2
Axar bowled really well,1
csk batting like they've got 40 overs to get to 100,6
"Might be unpopular, but I think this will be the year that finally causes CSK to make big changes in the squad.",5
"I swear dhoni was the last person to start ""experimenting""so why all these batting order changes now?

We need to get going at 3 down. Who do we send? Jadhav instead of someone like jadeja or Curran or maybe even Dhoni himself.

Maybe Dhoni thinks this whole season is just an experiment for the next one ffs",2
Axar 1/14 and 1/18 in the first two matches.,1
All CSK had to do was bat first and post 160 and game was theirs.,2
[deleted],11
This CSK team sucks without Raina and Rayudu.,5
Anyone tell me how good are avesh and ruthuraj Gaikward haven't really seen them in the domestic circuit much,1
"CSK is my favorite team. Never a dull moment with CSK.

  


No, no one is holding gun to my head \*blinks furiously\*",6
Mishrah waddling after that is a highlight,3
The batters didn’t get 200 but the bowlers making it seem like 250.,3
Mishra looks so weird with hair,5
"This year IPL should launch a new award :

The most pot bellied player to play !!",6
fuck you whitehat jr.,3
"Some of you thought we were slow. Well well well, how the turntables",4
Axar patel will bowl superbly throughout the series but when in do or die matches he will get hammered mercilessly 😂😭,1
A run rate of 4.7 after 10.....I have no words,1
Amit Thiccra,0
This is so much like 2019 CSK batting,3
Teams score more than this in most ODIs these days,7
CSK missing counter-attacking Raina. Even Rayudu was good.,6
Is batting first the strat for this season?,6
"We are doing a KKR, screw this team",2
"Mystery delivery or not, Mishra most certainly has some mystery hair out there....",8
Is this the lowest scores by CSK in 10 overs?,4
Time for another Dhoni Masterstroke™.,5
Req run rate - 13.02,6
Can't imagine CSK chasing this down,5
I would cast Amit Mishra if I have to remake Yeh Waqt Hamara Hai.,5
"As a CSK fan, I have wished for 3 CSK batsmen to get out",9
"I see a bottom 4 this year for SRH, KKR, CSK and RCB.",0
that ball has forgot how it feels like to cross the boundary,6
Who is Nokia?,3
Wtf is pant saying 😂,5
When was Mishra dropped from the Indian team?,2
[deleted],2
Someone fuckin tape pant,-2
No way are CSK winning from here,5
NRR control mode on.,1
Mishra to bowl a loopy googly and get a wicket,1
"Every time I see a young Indian players failing I can’t help but think of MI and their success with young players. Rana, Hardik, Krunal, SKY and Chahar literally won games in their first few games for MI. It’s insane how they manage it every single time. I wish other teams had that ability.",9
Someone should tell CSK that NRR isn't going to matter if they lose every match,13
Kedhar jadhav has to do something. The guy gets a free run in the team every time for what idk,2
Autotune’s been real silent ever since Pant started singing in the stump mic,6
Somehow pant manages to beat the crowd noise in his ability to annoy,6
Rabada has 3 overs left and required RR is already 13 lmao,8
How's RJ Balaji reacting to Pant?,2
Jadhav is not good enough to play IPL anymore let alone coming in at 5.,4
Anyway how did they expect an opener (Gaikwad) to do a job at 4?,4
Love how Pant put up his leg to pad out the ball! Need to see more of that from every keeper!,1
"129 runs in 40 overs, this is easy peazy

Wait....

What do you mean this not an ODI?",11
"Csk gonna end the league with

8 points 

+10.10 NRR",21
[removed],8
"List the top 3 cringe things of the IPL. My opinion:


1. The Altroz car wankfest

2. Cred Powerplay promotion

3. CEAT Tyres strategic timeout",8
Csk making Mishraji look like Rashid,2
Why do we choose to chase? Are we not reading the pitch well? Or doing intentional hard mode?,1
"Watson, Faf, Vijay, Gaikwad , Dhoni all these players take time to set in. 



They need someone like Curran or Jadeja to just go berserk every match",4
CSK should start giving out lessons on how to bungle up moderately difficult chases by doing a RCB.... damn this is painful to watch now.,2
"Only CSK  can send Jadhav  now, ahead of Sam or Jadeja with a leg spinner on",4
Two ripped bois out there in the middle,2
"Just turned on TV, seriously what is this shit?",2
Who else sees Axar Patel and gets reminded of Himesh bhai's 'Aksar Dil tujhe yaad karta hai' from the legendary movie Aksar?,3
Very good run rate for a test match.,1
"It doesn't matter if CSK lose this or the next couple of matches (CSK has done that and managed to win the tournament btw) but they seriously need to rethink their lineup. Tbh though, they have no squad depth - Vijay and Gaikwad are the best they have when two of their main players are not available. Get Kanos next season please.",3
I am sorry Axar that I ever Shit on you.,2
This is painful,3
RR of 4.78. Quick for tests tbf,3
I like the live concert going on in dugout Rn,2
Gaikwad didn't even get much time to prepare and came to bat in pressure situations twice and failed. Feel bad for him. I hope he does well next time.,1
CSK losing two matches in a row?! What am I seeing?,6
wolverine meme of me missing my boys raina and rayudu. first time we may miss the playoffs.,3
Chennai Retirement Village,12
"One thing i fail to understand about chasing teams in the shorter format... Why would you only score 47 in 10 overs, in a 178 run chase? You should either go down swinging if the rr gets that high, or score the runs.

So many teams just play like this and then when the lower order inevitably fails, act surprised.",5
Goddamn Pant moaning behind the stumps is gonna be the end of me,3
"Rabada still got 3, goodluck CSK",8
Dugout commentary is fun.,4
"Who the fuck are they gonna target

9 overs left and 3 for Rabada",3
I SWEAR TO GOD IF TOMR THE TOSS WINNING CAPTAIN OPTS TO BOWL,10
CSK need a big over now. Its nearly game over otherwise,3
"FAF now ha 2000 runs in IPL   
one of the gems in IPL no doubt about it",3
Should have sent Curran instead of stat padder Jadhav,3
So is no one going to talk about Mishra's hair plugs?,2
For fuck sake. Rabada has 3 overs left,3
CSK fans need to chill out. Your team is playing without couple of key batsmen.,1
There is a conspicuously inconspicuous truck loaded with money inching its way to Suresh Raina's house right now.,5
DC need to get du Plessis to close the game.,3
"That's quite a high run rate from CSK given this is only the 2nd session of the first day. This amount of risk isn't needed, guys.",10
Ah Faf getting his timing back or I think!,1
6 runs this over... rejoice boys!,5
Jadhav plays as if his left leg is made pf wood.,2
Wonder what mental gymnastics CSK and Dhoni fans have up their sleeves today.,4
DC would be the only team to win both their first games!,1
Lmao Graeme Swann Singing BJP's kinda song to Irfan Pathan in dugout. where the fuck is Robelinda to record this? 😂😭,5
It is at this time the butt hurt fans start chain down voting,3
Did they just say .. unacademy run ... ? wtf!,4
Please no pathan in dugout -_-,5

Have CSK just given up? They never even tried???,3
Thala pls make us orgasm with your last over sixes,3
Are CSK trying to save NRR at least? Doesn't look it...,2
FUCK CURRENT RUN RATE ISN'T EVEN 5,8
14 RPO? Ez,1
The cheer for the single says a lot about the situation,0
this will be an interesting match by the fifth day.,4
Timeline shows all 1s and a W. smh,2
"I think csk will be good again even if  dj bravo, rayudu and tahir finds place in Playing 11 after initial 7 matches,csk is no team to underestimate.",2
Any idea how much time and money went into Mishra ji getting his full head of hair. Asking for a friend 🙄,2
No last over fury today I guess by greatest finisher as Rabda still got 3 left for death overs,2
Can't believe we're gonna get to 160 by hitting 4 sixes in the last over and make it look close again.,5
Faf's t20 strategy is to rotate strike until 14-15 over then tee off.,4
"I just don't get the plan. If CSK manage to get within even 20 runs of the target, it will be glorious.",2
I can picture Mishra imagining - Chup baith laude,2
Think CSK gives up every game by end of power play,2

Nice strike rotation.,2

Mishra ji has been good,1
Tis the over lads,2
Good to see the experience of Pant helping Mishraji in bowling.,3
This is not brilliant bowling but poor batting. Let's make it clear.,3
why wont jadhav get a hamstring injury now,8
This match is gonzo. No way they are scoring 100 in 50 balls. Another boring match. Apart from the first match the quality of cricket has been sub-par.,1
Why is big papa Stoinis not bowling?,1
Jadhav century when?,1
they gotta target avesh. he's they're last hope,1
This is bad run rate for an ODI. Much less T20,4
My wish for legendary Jadhav Dhoni partnership looks like it might come True yay,1
"I think Faf at 3 is good and shouldn't be made to open! He gets his time till the 10-12 and gets his timing! When he opens with Watto , he's pressured to use the fielding restrictions to make runs",2
fk the required rate is 13 +    ftw ffs,2
Smart of Iyer to bowl out Avesh when Dhoni is not on crease.,2
"Shall we target Avesh, please?!!?",2
Inb4 dhoni kills the match and hits last 3 sixes to impress his fans,2
"Plizz, this has to be the over where we start trying.",2
The dew factor was hyped up so much but it hasn't been all that bad for teams bowling second. Why do teams still choose to chase when the pitch is clearly slower in the second innings?,2
"HE'S THRILLED

LMAO",3
"CSK need an agressive opener who can hit out during the powerplay and give Watson some time to get in. Vijay is not working at all, maybe use Sam Curran as a pinchhitter.",2
they should've just said unpadh app instead of unacademy.,2
 lmao that was pretty jokes from Slats,1
CSK played Axar Patel like Muttiah Muralitharan,6
Avesh can be the key for CSK. Who this guy?,3

Dhoni setting himself upto hit two sixes in the last over.,8
"Shivaji: The boss had a dialogue where a character comments on a person's hairstyle   ""Looks like someone spat 'paan' on his head""

We are not a particularly good team to watch,3
Lol,1
Kedhar jadhav is the robin uthapa of csk,4
Costly drop,1
CSK biggest problem is that every fucking bastman need 15-20 balls to settle,8
Hetmyer I fucking trusted you,5
thanks for the dropped catch!,3
SIMRAN,3
Shitmyer,3
Bruh what a drop,2
Why'd you drop Faf!,5
Fucking hetmyer. Dropping dollies,2
Oh come on Hetmyer..what the fuck was that..damn it.,3
You. Do. Not. Drop. Faf,4
How ruthless was Faf running out the Gaikwad kid like that wow!,2
Hahahahahahahahahahaha.... Get fucked DC! Get absolutely fucked!,1
I P L Fielding!,2
Avesh is at least 10kph slower than I remember. What happened?,3
that catch could've just ended the match,3
"Dhoni is the best finisher.

  


Nah, more like quantum of defeat manager",2
I think Faf has gotten settled finally,1
S H I T M Y E R,7
Glad to see Hetmeyer is still shit after leaving RCB,9
What the fuck is up with the fielding this IPL,3
Faf a run behind the orange cap!,2
The fuckkk...that was their win.,2
Fielding has been truly substandard,3
You fucking donkey,5
DC on a winning streak was statistically bound to happen after so many IPL seasons.,6
that’s a LULW,2
Tactical Drop,9
IPL fielding,3
Delhi dropping catches just to make it interesting,4
[deleted],3
Not a match without dropping a catch.,7
 BC always fuck up with catches!,5
Why the fuck would you drop faf,7
Hetmyer I love you. Thanks for atleast leaving some hope in this innings.,4
Hetmayer madarchod abhi match khatam ho jaata,7
The fielding this IPL is absolutely terrible,8
Hetmeyer only practiced his girlfriends bowling in this lockdown,21
"Very cool, Hetmyer, very cool.",1
Crocodile catching hands,2
"Ok so curran at 6, jadeja at 7, dhoni at 8. U heard it here",6
Ponting will lose his shit with DC fielding,3
Match was sealed with that match,0
We were robbed of a Vijay Jadhav partnership,6
"thank you hetmeyer, very cool",6
"If any of the bowlers like Umesh Yadav, Avesh, Siraj etc. had half the brain of so called bowler Rajat Bhatia they could've been so much more useful",2
They are not even mad about the drop. That's how cock sure they are of victory.,8
CSK plays this kind of cricket because they just want to burn down r/cricket,7
"Haha I love how before this match Kaif said "" not easy fielding in Dubai"" so can't blame the coach now 😂😭",3
Benchod Kohli.....oh wait...,6
"Even if Avesh gives up 12 runs, they are still behind the required rate.",3
So many sitters put down already in this ipl,2
" 

117 runs in 49 balls

  and thats 15 an over   


when the fuck are you gonna hit",8
"Rayudu goes - ""Dhawan stole my 3D glasses"" :)",12
Dhoni is older than csk's bowling coach balaji who last played an ipl in 2014,10
"LMAO that was a dolly  


Shitmeyer",9
Fafda might just get hernia carrying so much weight of the team consistently,10
Apparently Hetmyer wants to go back to RCB,8
Jadhav should leave,5
"Just started watching, is this another NRR match?",6
"Dhoni .. I was in mood to come but my mood has changed after catch drop.

  


Will come 8 down now.",10
"Feel bad for Avesh, man should have gotten FAF's wicket.",6
Csk has been so fuckin shit for 2 years man. Dhoni carried them and now clearly even Dhoni is not capable of doing shit.,14
whoa - 7 runs this over...,2
"ipl fielding standards are very bad, below than psl, bbl and or even bpl",-2
Hetmeyer continuing rcb tradition,8
The weakest bowler went for 7 when the nrr is 13+,6
how tf did we score 200 last match,4
This Delhi team had Rabada Cummins Morris all in the same team 2 yrs ago.,8
Does csk know its playing a t20?,6
Would Raina have made any difference to this team?,4
Okay that was a good over!,3
"Damn, that would've been the end of the game with Faf out",3
Hetmyer just dropped 2 sure points,2
Hetmyer thought it was Jadhav.,6
Guys they used the Avesh over well. Got more than 6,3
[Murali Vijay reading this thread going...](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SeRc0PwkuGo/hqdefault.jpg),7
"no no no that's Vijay ,Jadhav or Ruturaj you are supposed to drop. Why tf would you change the plan",2
We all felt that arey yaar from Avesh,4
"RRR is approaching 14 

pretty close to when Dhoni plays for NRR",8
"Haha, they are not even playing for NRR now",5
"Club level fielding, dropping 2 sitters",2
There are no cheer leaders this year so the cameramen spend more time showing fielders who drop catches on the big screen,9
"Pls dont play like RCB guys

Leave shit batting to us",8
No way CSK gonna win with 3overs of Rabada left,4
"Hetmyer playing 6d chess

Not catching faf n not letting sam curran in",6
"Man csk has a habit stretching doable targets, and its seriously frustrating to watch though they have such a destructive batting line up",3
Iyer's captaincy on point. He has bowled out Axar and also managed to save up 3 Rabada overs. Now squeeze in two Avesh overs and he's kosher,6
Delhi can use stoinis as well instead of avesh if they wish,0
"Kedar is a very frustrating t20 batsman to watch, would rather MS use up these balls at least if he means he can tee off at some point

What is Kedar going to do? A couple boundaries at tops.",2
There's playing too wildly like DC last game and playing too sensibly like CSK this game and last game.,2
I think dhoni perfectly understands that his ability to bat has deteriorated. Sadly his fans still think he is still the great finisher he once was.,8
"If going away form RCB couldn't resurrect Hetmyer's IPL career, I doubt anything else would.",2
No way even the NRR is being saved in this match,1
What the fuck is this test match,1
"60 runs in 12 overs

Tears arent rolling down my cheek, its sweat i tell you",7
"CSK fans after the lack of intent against Royals : can't get any worse than this. Lost by 16 runs without ever trying for a win
CSK innings today : Hold my beer",5
Gentle reminder: Rabada got 3 more overs. Thanks,5
How did DD score only 175 with Pant not out?,2
"They have guys like Fleming and Mr.Cricket himself as a part of a think-tank and they still can't figure out,

Bat around Faf and everyone else should be told to bat with intent and at a 130+S/R right from the start. 

Jadhav's 7 off 10 is baffling.",2
never seen jadhav run a double.,3
Only team that can lose from this situation is Delhi. Never unclench.,2
I think Jadhav is physically incapable of running a two anymore.,3
Another 4... what's happening?!,2
Csk’s twitter just tweeted a snoring emoji,8
Gaikwad looks so nervous and out of his depth it’s not even funny,4
fuck man someone's gotta help faf out here,4
CSK steadily inching towards victory with a RR of 5,2
Gavaskar relating too hard with his 36 off 174 in world cup.,3
"It’s so hard to support this team, all of our Indian batsman besides Dhoni are all selfish fucks playing for average",1
"I wonder why csk fans shot more on Jadhav than dhoni...
Atleast Jadhav has some intent....",3
Dhawan finally got to do a scuba dive.,4
Dhawan with the good old Mishra dive,1
They don't have a proper batsman after faf.,2
I'm digging shaved Mishra ji,3
Dhawan doesn't run in those glasses. He swims,4
"What the hell does Jadhav has to do there, when you have sloggers like Curran, Jadeja?",5
How many sixes can Dhoni hit today?,3
Vijay and Jadhav is what CSK fans deserve.,7
"Joke is 5 min late but I'll still post it:

You can take the player out of RCB but you can't take RCB out of the player.",3
Rabada still has 3 overs remaining. And Stoinis 4.,2
Mishra uncle looking as disappointed and helpless as my dad every time he sees me,5
"I'm not watching the match. Are they at least trying? 

Or it's the same old story?",2
Finally !!!,2
Quantum of Loss intensifies,4
Oi lucky there faf. Hit it straight down the ground.,2
How is Prithvi the same age as me but looks older than my Dad?,5
Jesus christ Mishra is always depressed,5
Lol Dhawan looked like that kid in a swimming pool with that dive,8
"Faf is in a 'fuck this, I am out of this shit' mode now",6
Will ncb arrest hetmyer for illegal posession of cocaine  on his head?,4
Incoming Dhoni's useless sixes at last over,2
Dhawan is one of five people on Earth that can pull off those shades.,5
Vijay has been so shitty for so long now,4
Dhawan shouldn't have dropped that...... blot!,2
Only CSK players who are good against spin are Rayudu and Raina. CSK will miss them badly if Rayudu stays unfit,8
Dhawan’s glasses are next level,7
Nice to see BBL fielding carry over to the IPL,3
Dhawan looks like a user build player just for cricket 07,9
"Mishra ji would have caught that, his reaction says it all",7
mishra's toupeé looks rather comical. how is he making it stick on his head tho? considering all the humidity.,3
RRR came down from 14.5 to 14.48 after those 2 balls,1
That catch would have sealed the game. Fuck Shimron.,2
[deleted],4
Ah yes let’s wait for Dhoni to come in and start hitting when RRR is 40,4
Dhawan bhai what the fuck are those glasses,1
csk thinks positive nrr is a win,3
Mishra looks like a man who scrimped and saved every penny but lost everything to a pyramid scheme everytime someone hits a boundary off him,2
Delhi trying their best to lose this.,2
I will lose my mind if the RR hits 6 RPO.,2
we need sixes. a lot of sixes.,1
I was wondering what's changed in Mishra ji.. I think he has a new haircut now.,1
"I think Faf's legacy would remain underappreciated in CSK behind Bravo,Morkel and Watson",3
"If Faf played for Gujarat would he be called fafda?

^sorry",10
Oh I forgot faf crossed 2000 IPL runs,3
Back to back boring chases.,3
Jadhav putting pressure on faf unbelievable,2
Winning games is for chumps. True champions reduce the quantum of loss,6
CSK just look like they don’t give a fuck. Maybe they need their family in the bubble,10
That catch would've been the match,9
JADHAV RAN 2,7
"Csk have a bunch of players who have a tendancy to play these 8(12) innings.

See today Vijay and Jadhav. Also Gaikward did. You can't have these many players in a team and win a T20",9
What are those glasses?!!?,3
"CSK ain't even playing for NRR now, wtf?",3
Dhawan sporting that eyewear as a throwback to him being made an absolute clown and got runout by Shaw in first match.,2
Wtf is Jadhav’s ability?,3
So this is how a boundary looks like..,4
Let me get this straight. Dhoni refuses to come up the order and play tuk tuk cause he wants others to accelerate. Jadhav and Gaikwad come out and play tuk tuk. What the fuck?,10
CSK just needs someone to score the fastest fifty. That's all.,3
"Now Faf has played mandatory 23 of 21, now his time to smoke sixes like last match.",2
KP loves saying outfuckses,1
Is ishant suffering from a injury? Would love to watch him bowl....,1
Looks like CSK will play for NRR management the entire season. XD,2
Please Jadhav get out so that we can get Sam,3
I can't believe that Dhoni convinced the whole team to play like him ffs!,12
Mishra is so good,1
I get CSK are missing three players (two coming back next match) but they are straight selling trying to just reduce the margin of loss the last two matches,2
pant is just scaring batsmen now,2
Perplexing cricket once again from csk. And no excuse hazing a very manageable 179,4
[deleted],3
Can't wait to see Dhoni & faux Dhoni bat together tonight,2
"Today clearly, they aren't even intending NRR",5
Guess Curran is not getting to face the leg spinner,1
Wtf is CSK doing.,7
well here is that shit chanting again,-1
Oh shut up about Heymeyer's haircut ffs Graeme Swann.,4
ruk gaya ruk gaya rUK GAYA,1
Rabada still has 3 overs left,0
"csk is nowhere even close to 100 and they are bowling the 13th over. ah, their downfall is nice to see ngl",2
"Gays, I have a theory. Please listen. MS Dhoni tHaLA is deliberately looosing matches in start so he win in last matches and show how cool he is under pressure. No need to panik gays, keep calm and support csk 😎😎😎😎",7
Mishra ji needs a wicket to finish the awesome spell!,0
Even MI doesn't dominate CSK the way DC is.,-1
Cmon we need a Faf super spree,0
Ffs how much lucky is Faf gonna get tonight?,0
Punter picks his nose. Gets caught by the camera and proceeds to do it again.,0
"You too, Jadhav. Ffs",1
That smile that fucking smile,5
Curran is the only guy in this team who actually looks to score from ball one. Make sure he bats up the order.,11
They seem to have forgotten how to play,2
Well bowled Mishraji,1
Dhoni's quantum of loss™ is rubbing off on the other players too...,4
Is Delhi's Daniel Sams a fast bowler ?? He got 30 wickets last BBL 2nd best was just 22,2
11 runs this over... itshappening.gif,1
I don't think I have EVER seen CSK lose two matches in a row. Must be something so magically different about this IPL.,8
All these years we've been wondering when the disadvantages of age would affect CSK. Looks like that year is finally here.,11
At least we were actually trying to chase our target yesterday,21
Come on pant,1
Cyclops Dhawan looking a bit rusty in the field.,3
I wonder what csk will discuss during this “strategic time out”,3
So. Many. Edges,3
Does anyone instruct these fans to ‘dance’ on screen? If that’s what they’re doing,2
Jadhav pls get bowled first ball so Curran can play,9
even pant can't read mishra rn.,1
Ngl smiling Mishra is handsome,2
CSK miss rayudu,2
Mishra Ji has shaved off at least 7 of 8 years with that hair and shave,9
Wicket has slowed down. Puts pants and iyers innings on perspective,6
CSK boutta be banned again because this is not how you play unless you fucking fixed it,10
"Mishra is a fucking stud, that smile",7
Rabada+Nortje got 5 out off 7 remaining overs,7
CSK team is filled with players who think I am gonna take some time to get in because I know I can win matches on my own. Be it Watson Faf Jadhav and that's where they are lacking behind in Req.Run Rate,8
I would rather shave my head rather than having wig.,2
Bro even the running between wickets looks dead. They're jogging/walking the run and occasionally a second. Atleast run the first one hard and the second one will open up.,7
Dhoni to come in next and finish with 50(30) in a 20 run defeat.,7
"What’s the root of all this batting failure of csk? Vijay at the top?
Maybe we should open with Curran.",7
Predict key elements of Dhoni's after match speech on the performance today.,4
Man this is appalling.,8
"OK I'm now convinced that the dude in the field playing under the name 'Mishra' isn't actually Amit Mishra. Seriously, looks nothing like Mishra from last season.",1
We might see Delhi playing with 3 spinners from the next match.,1
Fleming sending some intent from the dugout.,2
Someone shove a gove into pants mouth.,2
Faf is not going to hit rabada.,1
Faf is probably asking kedar to get out,8
"Just kill me. I'd rather we lose like RCB trying, than this bullshit. Two games in a row.",6
My team CSK has gone from Chennai Super Kings to Chennai Shitty Kezhams,3
3 rabada overs of the last 7. Good luck with that,3
"Okay CSK fans I admire you for putting up with this bullshit.

For me, good riddance to Dhoni and his incomprehensible tactics!",6
"This jadhav does not know what he is doing.  He should just hit or get out. Bloody hell theres dhoni, sam curran down the order waiting and this guy is thinking of taking singles ffs",4
RRR is 15 now. Perfect time for CSK to start thinking about 2s,24
Scared that they will go after avesh a lot,2
Q U A N T O M O F L O S S,4
Get ready for some action bois.,2
"Who wanna see KXIP, DC and RR in playoffs this time",8
Jadhav is shite. He cant even run 2,2
Let's see what excuse he has to give today,0
CSK is just pissing me off now.,6
CSK played like this last game and still managed to get 200. I think 176 is not a worry for them.,1
[deleted],12
">How is he supposed to win games when the RRR is 15 when he comes to bat?

Maybe take same fucking responsibility for once!",3
"As a long time fan, I'm getting let down by this lack of intent and lethargic play style",7
I cannot think of any reason of Murali Vijay staying in the playing XI. That guy needs to go.,3
"Would it still be an ""Unacademy Cracking Six"" if there were a World Cup final overthrows situation...?",5
"If CSK lose this, it will be the first time they lost consecutive IPL matches since 2008, while chasing in both.",3
all these fan captures have proven beyond doubt that managers in every fucking company are idiots,8
15 RPO required. Perfect time for MSD to walk in and reduce quantum of loss.,6
Who are the commentators in the Dugout rn? Apart from Swann.,-1
"Wtf man 

We can't always depend on Faf. Others aren't even trying run a ball. Vijay, Watson, Ruturaj everyone had an SR below 100 today.",4
Get raina back ffs,1
Mishraji ageing backwards,3
"come on boys, just 3 overs of 20+ runs and we got this.",-1
Good that they finished spinners early and quality seam still present,1
Mishra created almost 2 chances every over this match and I think he'll be the one to be dropped for Ashwin!,5

"Stoinis yet to bowl a over, perhaps he can be given a go",1
Why is dhoni coming at no7???? They need him out there tuk tuk-ing,2
CSK gonna keep playing to preserve NRR every match lol,1
1 over from stoinis on 15th will give more options,2
Csk only wakes up when RRR is 20,2
In before CSK proves the sub wrong again by getting 105 from 7.,2
Why D Dhenier not play I Tahhair?,1
Dont bowl Avesh...literally Delhi's only plan,1
"I understood last match of CSK when the score was too big, they eventually wanted to preserve the NRR. But I do not understand the approach in this match so far. Atleast give it a go before it gets too late",8
why need extra runs at the death when csk gonna make 216 look 250 and 170 a 200 😎,6
Honestly no shame in losing to IPL 2020 champions Delhi.,8
3 overs of Rabada left btw,3
CSK gonna win the ipl on NRR,5
"3 wickets down and 15 rrr, are they trying to lose?",2
This CSK season gonna be all Harsha taking a dig at Dhoni? GOD That guy has enough of his revenge. It was 5 years ago man 😂😭,1
"Still early on in the season, but things are looking ominous for CSK.

In the past seasons, the spinners were clutch for CSK by applying the chokehold on opponents. But if they're not effective then CSK doesn't really have the batting depth (more so intent and aggression) to consistently make 180+.  


They're really missing Raina and Harbhajan.",2
"I seriously don't understand why is Jadhav in a cricketing team? 😂.

Son of an MLA, rich businessman, or a goon?.
Like, what's he doing on a cricket ground.",2
They are accelerating,1
Aavesh to nivesh in runs,3
check out csk's account on twitter,4
crafty.,1
Avesh khan... More like Trash Khan!,-1
So the decision to chase was a disaster.,1
That was unexpected 4. Don't give me hope.,2
"The match is lost, I just wanna see Dhoni come in and hit some sixes now. Btw well played by DC",5
[deleted],4
Noice.,1
"First there was only way to chase ie go for win

Then Csk brought chasing for Nrr

We were just getting used to chase for Nrr

Then this match comes

Csk neither playing for win nor for Nrr

What a cap Ms is. Completely redifining the game",2
Jadhav 4! Chill bro! Shanti.,2
LMAOOO IYERR,3
Jadhav hits a 4 i repeat jadhav hits a 4,3
We need to nuke the whole team,3
"So Rabada is doing 15,17,19 with Avesh/Stoinis and Nortje taking the rest of the overs.",1
Peak jadhav,1
"I am all for turning up the stump mic, but not when Pant is keeping. MF can't shut up for 2 seconds.",5
Kedar would have been a good investment 10 to 15 years ago,3
Guys how big a bid would Dhoni get in next year's mega auction ? considering Dhoni age he may get released.,0
"Surely it's better for Scurran to come in up the order in situations like this, smash 20(8) or something to keep RRR under control than holding him back to finish in what will pretty soon be a very demanding situation",2
Jadhav balancing it out,1
"GO FOR THAT FUCK IT MOD FAF, PLAY FOR THE LOLZ! THIS GAME IS DONE! I AM DONE!",2
A lot of players on this team need to retire from IPL after this season. The Dad army is playing like Grandpa army.,2
Theory : Thala purposely instructed batsmen to let the rrr balloon till the death so the team could get practice at scoring under pressure in the end overs.,0
"""It's a pleasure to watch these guys play the game the way they are playing now"" Wtf commentator are you fucking high and are you watching the same game as me?",10
"Rabada going to bowl 15, 17, 19 overs.",3
[deleted],9
Comms getting all worked up over one four,3
Our players are just so.... not exciting. Mediocre.,5
Avesh is trash. So is Mohit. We need Ishant back ASAP.,4
100 runs in 40 or so balls is definitely achievable but not at this rate,2
Intent!!,4
"Idk what the logic of sending in Jhadav, an accumulator was for. They could have sent in Curran who actually is capable of playing at 18(6) knock or something to breathe life into the innings, but now it seems like nothing can save them.",3
"Another 4, is this real life?",5
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/izi98o/comment/g6jmspl?context=1

Extending this theory:

The whole CSK team is innumerate

They just bat however and then find out at the end if they won",3
Mote Avesh... Useless cunt.,2
lmao Mark Nicholas comparing Kedar Unkill to Sachin lmao,6
"Someone get Janani off my screen, so cringe.",2
CSK fans - Please don't give me hope..,1
Nivesh in avesh working out for CSK NRR,1
Wow that was an awkward conversation.,7
Can anybody tell me are they trying to chase it or nor? Or they playing for NRR?,1
Raunak Kapoors prediction coming true after 2 years.,2
can someone hook me up with whatever shit greame swan is on,2
He compared shots not players Shiva why are you so butthurt,1
Jadhav showing intent whats happening today,2
Jadhav slapped the shit out of that one.,2
"If CSK lose this, it will be the first time they lost consecutive IPL matches since 2008, while chasing in both.",3
INTENT^(TM),3
Would have been a blinder,2
Faf would have caught that shot,3
"CSK scoring at less than 6 an over

Avesh is going at over 10 an over lmao",9
"Honestly, when Kedar is hitting boundaries he's really pleasant to watch. His style is quite graceful.",4
I loved that catch attempt.  It looked graceful af,1
Need only 4 4s an over 🙄,1
Avesh is playing a parallel match lmao,3
"Kedhar Jadhav, Amit Mishra, Piyush Chawla, etc should start a Hobbits XI",4
"Yeah RCB guys, we both have lost badly, but we did try..",4
WTF is Sivaramakrishnan mad at Mark Nicholas for.. guess he's unhappy about CSK losing,8
"Since when is comparing someone's shot to Sachin/Gavaskar, an unpardonable offence??

Is Siva on dope",9
"Calling it now - CSK will win this.

Score: 75/3, 13.1",0
"I think CSK under MS "" captain cool "" Dhoni has become way too cool and are not taking things seriously.",2
Street smart bois,1
Dinda academy already preparing a scholarship for Avesh Khan,4
Jadhav finally realises theres 97 runs needed of 40 and not 40 of 97 jeez,4
"What the fuck was that bullshit Shiva? He actually did look like Sachin with that backfoot shot, but it doesn't mean you're saying he's as good as him. Moron",9
KP is someone who'd get fascinated by anything,5
Atleast could have sent in Sam. He wouldn't have taken this long to start hitting.,5
95 off 38 fuck off,3
Jadhav being Jadhav again lmao,1
CSK doing scientific experiment to see how long fans will believe they are trying.,12
"intent from csk, is this the real life",6
Avesh Khan is still bowling alright. 10 an over when RRR is 15 is perfectly fine. Lord Umesh gives lot more than this.,4
"Jadhav, that's the 30 yard line, the boundary line is the one behind it",4
Avesh the weak link,1
CSK can literally never chase anything above 160 with this tuk tuk batting line up. Only Faf shows intent,8
Our weak link is really weak,8
Thank god atleast he is showing INTENT,3
What is csk trying to do,2
https://twitter.com/ChennaiIPL/status/1309534340712247296,5
"**CSK's spinners**

Chawla + Jadeja -- 8 overs | 77 runs | 2 wickets

**DC spinners**

Axar + Mishra -- 8 overs | 41 runs | 1 wicket",3
Nortje looks like a mix of Santner and Lockie,1
Avesh khan the next umesh yadav who is the next dinda,0
"Meanwhile the 'number of topics/players that commentators cannot speak on' list is growing. Will just have a bunch of phrases like ""jai mata di let's rock, fantastic shot"" by the end of this IPL",4
"Lol commentator saying this is the greatest game ever

Seems like his 1st match noob",2
That's 2 chances that Avesh has created. One dropped and other in no man's land.,2
the only thing this guy Avesh needs is a headband and he's set for the Dinda army,3
Chasing 15 an over when Rabada has 3 left. Yeah Good Luck. Fucking trash calculations,2
"“MS is a time traveler. He is bringing back the days of when you can play as a sole keeper. Thala behind thr stumps is invaluable. Any run he scores is a bonus”

Dhoni fans in 2030",7
What's Siva on about? Is he joking about comparing Kedar's shot to Tendulkar? Because I hope he is.,4
the dugout guys are really overestimating these guys lol,3
"Csk bored of winning IPL, eyes on test championship now",3
RR is 6 now! 😍,9
"man csk have been in top 4 ,12 times now. They are high on success",0
"There's always a weak link in a team, Avesh Khan today. Any team which does not have that?",1
Avesh Khan is the Umesh Yadav of this match.,0
I miss Ishant,2
"Dhoni's brain seems to have stopped working, every match the openers screw up in the powerplay by being well below the required run rate, he keeps persisting.
Every match it is pretty obvious, going in with just 5 bowlers ain't working,he keeps persisting.
Almost all the batsmen takes up 15-20 balls before they hit out, except Curran,he keeps persisting.
Every match the fielding gifts the opposition 10-15 runs, he keeps persisting with such embarrassing fielders like Watson, Jadhav,  Vijay who ain't even performing with their primary skill to cover over their defeciencies in the field.",10
im waiting for some classic MSD tuk-tuk,4
"imagine actually playing test like t20, very ambitious from CSK this",2
Imagine if ashwin played instead of avesh.,2
Jadhav seriously fucked Indian middle order cwc2019 and now CSK facing the Jadhav issue,2
"but what is jadhav even supposed to do? if he can't hit khan every ball, it's gonna be very tough vs other speedsters.",0
Jadhav is so good to watch when hes in form,1
Need another boundary to maintain the rr,2
"it is apparently a sin to compare a player’s shot with Sachin and Gavaskar, who knew?",2
How does CSK have so high fair play award points especially with Dhonis catch claim in that match ?,4
How do you spell nortje? Nokia? Nort je ? Genuine question,4
Avesh has bowled all right. Too bad the fielders made him look worse than his performance.,9
Stoinis could have bowled this over. That guy just won them last match,3
Lol fair play award,3
Chennai playing for that Net runrate,2
This Csk team is like 08 RCB,2
Holy shit Du Plessis is so streaky,1
Fairplay thing is a joke isn’t it?,2
"Slats: That shot looks a little like Sachin just a little 

Shiva: Fuck you fucking cunt! Don't compare anyone to Sachin and Gavaskar!!!! Fuuuuuck you!!

SMH what's the big deal??",9
lol why do csk make every game a mad scramble towards the end. the opposition would score 120 and they would still manage to make it 50 required of last 4 overs,3
For FUCKS sake,2
Goddamn no man's land,3
Dhoni has already started playing for the NRR in dugout itself,5
The first time I’ve seen MI on 2nd place for Fairplay,6
"Fair play award> 

Amirite",8
Absurd shot from Faf,3
ratshit with csk at the top,1
Csk can't pull this off with 3 overs of Rabada. But it's 2020 and anything can happen.,6
"Lmao. Avesh is unlucky, af.",3
Is Ankit rajput not playing in this IPL?,2
They sounded so fukkn sweet but I thought he was out,2
https://i.imgur.com/PQylXxf.jpg,3
Avesh is so fucking unlucky man,3
IPL trophy never really mattered anyways. Fairplay trophy is where it's at for CSK fans.,8
CSK top of the fair play table despite Dhoni claiming a grassed catch? Interesting.,0
I know people are plugging Rahul as Kohli's replacement but Shreyas Iyer looks even better a fit for that position to me. They should try him out someday.,4
Faf should buy a lottery ticket or hit the casinos in Dubai,10
Wtf was that shot,3
Faf forget that fucking shot. Just go down the ground.,7
13 runs this over. Im ok with that,3
Have to feel bad for Avesh now,4
Now I'm starting to understand what it feels like to be a RCB fan.,7
Avesh screams after every ball like I do after getting up from the floor,6
TNETNI,2
CAN THE BALL STOP GOING IN NO MANS LAND LMAOO,4
Which Vijay is better? VJ or 3D?,2
"Moral - don't have 'esh' at the end of your name, or if you do, don't become a bowler",7
Avesh Khan has been unlucky tbh. Should've been among wickets,6
This over or never.,2
Hahahahaah,1
Wth is fair play award and why is rr down the list?,1
"Honestly Avesh has been worse than Nortje and Rabada but definitely not as bad as figures say. At least 5-10 of the runs conceded were pretty unlucky. I am perplexed as to his lack of pace, can't see him keeping Ashwin or Ishant out if he only offers 128-135kph.",2
"Jadhav hits few shots

N changes his test knock to odi knock",3
Need a 30 run over right now,2
"Okay, seriously asking, will this be the first season CSK not qualifying for the semis?..",1
"Avesh Khan has no idea how he is creating these chances. He's shit and unlucky, unlike Dube",1
Seems like this is the only match in the IPL so far going according to the time. All other games were taking too much time to complete. Good over rate by both teams.,2
Avesh has been so unlucky,4
I'm looking forward to the next avesh over,1
"If they don't even try in next over, call off this fucking match. Why are they Even playing. Fuck this match it is so frustrating to watch",1
"That was perfect by Mark Nicholas, the way he sold that shot by Faf lmao. 

No words necessary only laughter.",3
Avesh going for anything below 15 is absolute win in my eyes.,3
It's not just Avesh Khan's day,5
Lol did they just say that they like the intent by csk?,3
"CSK are serial winners

If they can't win the IPL, they'll make sure they win the wooden spoon",3
How much NRR should CSK lose by to top the table?,0
Dhoni’s choices are getting “quirkier” by the match,2
"That felt like a really expensive over, but in reality it still went for less than RRR",4
The choice between Mohit and Avesh is like choosing between being shot in the head or being shot in the head with a different gun.,3
Avesh lost about 4 potential wicket chances due to fielding,9
Ffs how lucky will faf get?,6
"Don't worry boys, we have fair play award",6
Why didn't dhoni come out to bat instead of jadhav? Why has he stopped taking responsibility?,5
Should just bowl Stoinis for the jokes,5
[deleted],9
guys guys! 13 runs this over. It's really happening.,0
Should have promoted Curran to smash Axar,4
SRH need kw on those pitch. Otherwise they ain't winning.,2
"""falls short"" todays match summary",3
The game is perfectly poised for Dhoni to come in and ruin CSK's chances for winning,2
Rabada needs to get in now,3
"Lmao, even CSK twitter account is tired and bored of this BS.",3
CSK going at 6 an over. Perfect opportunity for Dhoni to come in and bring it even lower,3
"*guy shagging his wife*

Vijay: ye mai kar leta hu aap dream11 ka team bharo",15
Faf with 9 lives.,5
Finally part timer Rabada coming on,2
Csk badly need Rayudu back,1
"Hotstar US's analytics team be like NRI's only like two things, transferring money to India and remakes of daily soap from previous decades",3
"Fuck Byjus

All my homies use RD Sharma",33
Is Dhruv Shorey still at CSK? Can't be worse than Murali Vijay,2
Raining Dropped Catches,7
DON'T BOWL SLOWER BALLS KG. FFS.,4
ahh now the real challenge,2
Toooo late to start the chase,9
"CSK are going to bullshit their way to a win, aren't they?",2
"In an alternate universe, Umesh and Avesh's son Uvesh is the purple cap holder.",19
"Good thing we saw off axar Patel, we can attack rabada easily",9
Faf might as well open the innings,3
Fuck they’re actually gonna win from here aren’t they?,-1
CSK is the new RCB.,2
"Here's comes rabada

There he goes",7
chuckles i am in danger,2
We are at 6rpo boiz.,10
Good lord Rabada has 3 more overs.,17
"Not going to win until we have Rayudu back, and drop these useless fucks",18
We need more of this,3
Faf's back must be tired from carrying this team,7
Lmao Dhoni!,3
How many catches dropped so far?,1
"If you think this csk team is a disaster, imagine this same team playing IPL 2021, which looks pretty likely",5
 is CSK gonna make a comeback out of nowhere now?,1
BREAKING NEWS: CSK reach 6 RPO,12
Remember when faf said he will sleep with KG rabada,6
So they are using Rabada like how Mumbai use Bumrah by keeping 3 of his overs for the end. Should be interesting.,9
Wow CSK are scoring at a run rate of 6. This is almost unheard of...in the 90's.,15
20 of 17 is criminal in this match.,1
I start respecting Faf more and more after every inning he plays.,2
What’s the point of Jadhav?,3
Say what you will about Jadhav but at least he's trying to win unlike their captain,3
for a moment I thought RRR is 5.09. The CSK logo was masking the extra 1,7
"Other teams shud learn from Csk

How they play as an unit

How they r obdient to their cap

Once the cap says Nrr everyone literally everyone plays according to it",6
"CSK winning this. I remember last year's play off. When things don't go your way in luck department, you lose.",3
Tbh Avesh is doing far better than we expected,3
Last 4 overs going to be bowled by nortje and Rabada... considering rabadas death bowling it's going to be very challenging for csk,2
Can csk replace Vijay with pujara?,6
[Imagine tweeting that when Dhoni's batting lol](https://i.imgur.com/5QC7C9h.jpg),10
"I am once again asking you, du Plessis, to carry the team -Bernie Sanders",5
"Feel like pure shit, just want Raina back",4
The fuck rabada,3
Bois started playing for NRR now!!,7
Kagiso bowling Faf.... so weird,3
By how much does CSK needs to lose to go below RCB?,2
maybe Jadhav should just open the innings. The guys much better than Vijay,5
"KP saying “no one can say they are dead and buried. “ Gonna say it now, they are dead and buried",7
Faf is a one man army,3
[deleted],8
[deleted],-1
Actually not a bad shot from the small boi.,3
"What's this behaviour Rabada, you are the chosen one",7
CSK bout to implode anytime soon,5
Jadhav should Atleast Fucking get out. Sam will Atleast hit sixes,3
CSK only start scoring right when their fans have given up hope,9
"Might place a bet on RCB winning more games than CSK this year. I'm a mentalist, I know.",15
Easy Dhoni! Don’t want the arm falling off before you bat,6
Swann don’t jink it for us please,4
fleming has really scared the heck out of jadhav,3
"Avesh khan has conceded 30 runs in 3 overs which is bad but not terrible, and r/cricket already wants him retired. Chill.",16
Prithvi Shaw is looking like a young Ravi Shastri,8
DK please play Nagarkoti tomorrow.,9
The fake crowd screaming for singles is adding salt to the wound,24
What is Shiva on tonight,2
Lol commentator saying 'this game is not done yet',7
Delhi might as well lose the plot if they keep giving boundaries so easily,2
Jadhav just trying to use rabadas pace shows that he cant do shit,1
Feeling CSK can pull this off,3
Match is dead,1
"I don't know why CSK keeps going so late. They leave so much against the best opposition bowlers, instead of atleast keeping the run rate manageable with the rest of the bowlers.",5
"we are shit, but we are fart to hard and crap your pants kinda shit whereas chennai are constipated shit that just refuses to come",24
Dugout doing their best to make this game interesting,11
Swann is like a kid with a permanent sugar rush.,8
Even jadeja is better than jadhav,3
[removed],12
Hit out or get out,2
My body is ready for a scintillating 15* (18 balls) from Dhenier,10
Someone tell CSK that points are valued ahead of net run rate.,19
CSK is 30 runs behind of DC,4
"To reverse their usual result against MI, CSK had to offer a sacrifice in which they reverse their usual result against other teams too",9
Can we get fake boos?,8
"Lol the ""CSK is RCB"" jokesters don't understand that the meme w RCB is they pull this shit every single year",11
"The thing is Faf and Sam are our most destructive batsmen, they need to build a partnership early on in the innings, Faf should be No 3 and Sam No4 that way once Murali gets out and if Watto doesn't perform they both have time to get set and then smash.",1
Innings was over as soon as Vijay saw off the first over like it was The first session of Day 1 at Centurion,7
"2 overs of Rabada remaining, CSK is done for today",2
How many more times Faf will save us from blushes?,1
"Bruh, can graeme swann stfu for once. Not every edge is a four, not every miss is a knick.",5
Both Sam and Jadeja should have been promoted to bat before fucking Jadhav,6
I think CSK is in the stage rn that RCB was after 2016 season - the eventual collapse of a team from championship caliber to meme team.,9
Daily reminder that Faf takes 1.6Cr while Vijay takes 2Cr.,17
Anything I've learned in IPL is CSK clawing out of the grave that's half buried everytime somehow. That never die spirit of their yellow international counterparts.,0
16 rub rate needed now. Not even peak Dhoni can do this.,2
"As long as MSD don't bat, CSK has a chance to win",1
"Whats wrong with Pant’s right eye? It was super red, looked injured",2
CSK look clueless...,2
"Exactly how jacked is Faf ?!

1 Stoin
1.25 Stoin",8
This over needs to go for 20+ !!,4
80 runs in 5 overs is doable,0
This team might be washed.,1
Seems like there is some setting that participating points for senior team get you into the playoffs,3
oshet Chennai still have Sam Curran in the shed thank god,2
Lmao Kedar’s sr is more than Faf’s now wtf,1
"CSK have had two good overs by their standards, and the asking rate has still gone up from 15 to 16.2 . haha cricinfo getting sassy",6
Bro DJ looks so depressed watching this batting.,26
Retirement home group discount available to CSK,6
No doubt that DC has the best pace duo in this IPL,2
OMG DHANI IS A GIRAT BATASMAN said every chennai ever,11
I want us to win this by a good amount for a nrr boost but that doesn’t seem to be happening :/,4
bc aisi maal teacher coding sikha rahi hai. Mere college me ek mallu sikhata tha.,7
They scored 35 of the last three overs. 80 of 5 is not impossible,1
Half of the dhoni's problems would be solved if he stops being such a wuss and comes up the order to bat. Sure take those 20 balls but only he can win the match from there. Pussies deserve to lose.,6
B I G  O V E R,3
Sorry Thala fans.. today's not your day,2
Anyone watching Graeme Swann on select? Coke studio?,2
We had a good run Csk fans. Need to rebuild.,3
At least they’re scoring off of overthrows guys,1
"“Out if he hits, he hit it and he’s not out”",1
I reckon curran's coming up next and we'll have to see the same old 'Dhoni's hiding' and other stale jokes on r/Cricket,10
Jadhav doesn't even want to run lol,1
Dont know whats the plan letting the run rate go so high to 12+ . Why leave it so late when u can start a little earlier.  Yes rayudu is missing but wheres the intent from the start,1
Closer than it looked..,1
That was closer than it looked...,1
Good throw though,1
Vijay and gaikwad combined 15 in 4.1 overs that's what screwed us up.,1
"""Another clever run rate game from MSD.""


Flipping hell, bore team. They better not make play offs.",10
Did someone even appeal for that one?,2
Only prime RCB can lose from here,10
Registering for whitehatjr. If i dont get the same cute teacher ill be pissed.,8
Why do umpires have to check for every single run out? That wasn't even close.,5
3D chess from Du Plessis there xD,1
"Losing the match is absolutely fine but i want to see more fight and intent from our team, this is how people know CSK and that's why we love this team.",1
"This is just suicide by CSK . Playing out of sorts Vijay at the top. Pushing newcomer and opener Gaekwad down the order where he looks simply out of place. With no Rayudu, this just add pressure on middle order Faf and Kedar. Dhoni will play out his usual NRR saving innings.",7
The only way CSK can win it is if the 3rd umpire changes from K Srinivasan to N Srinivasan,13
Who’s uncle is third umpire,9
Excuse me? 15 overs and... Not even 100 wtf?,10
Let the Sam simping begin,1
Does anyone know the code to r/cricket's league on dreamXI?,1
If this over isn't of 20+ this is done for sure,2
Third umpire sounds like old TT,3
"""Out if he hits...it did hit...not out""

Great stuff, Mark Nicholas.",8
Jadhav need to hit or GTFO,2
"Why does the third umpire need so much ‘rock and roll’. Morons, these umpires",2
148.8!,2
20- runs lose today too,4
Why is everyone calling this a lost match for csk? 80 in 30 is usual for csk plus Sam and Dhoni yet to bat,-3
"""nice, they are taking this deep""",4
"Even after all the trolls, most csk batsman gonna catch up with their strike rate

At last Murali Vijay's lame inning will seem like the only reason of the loss. 

Repeat telecast of last match",6
Can't wait for the customary Dhoni sixes in the last over 😍😍,19
Jadhav clearly has a soft spot for his older team,6
The real question is how do we blame Dhoni for this,15
"Are we sure that the Umpires aren't photo studio owners in their part times? he just said ""side yangle plisssss"" like my neighborhood photo studio guy...",5
"All this is Dhoni fault. 

The neighbour fucked my wife. Dhoni's fault",3
"bhai baith ja, batting nahi aane waali teri",2
Dhoni practicing those tasty NRR shots in the dressing room,11
"Execute your yorkers, be tight on the field and it's your game Delhi",1
Get out Kedar PLEASE for the sake of everyone watching,1
Why is Jadhav not even getting out :/,1
Jadhav should've come out in Ruturaj's place. Dude is a good run accumulator and provides stability but he can't smash the ball.,2
cHaSe,1
"Yes Avesh, all Nortje needs is tips from you lmao",7
"No commentators, Ms dhoni will not walk out to bat if a wicket falls now",2
What is this ridiculous idea of taking singles at this stage of the game,2
"This is appalling to watch. And you know what's funny about this? - inspite of being this shit, CSK will still somehow make it to the playoffs 😂",5
"CSK is rightfully getting shit for the batting but DC has bowled really well. Even Avesh has not allowed 20-25 run overs. Unless, DC bowlers completely lose it, this is too much for CSK.",2
Irfan trying to make excuses for Dhoni as how he didn't play any match in last 6 months like the other batsman were playing 100s of games during the fucking lockdown.,3
The DC middle over batting doesn't look so bad,1
big 'branes' in csk camp think that jadhav is capable of winning them the game with RRR 16,4
Delhi’s bowling clicking now too this team looks so so strong this season,5
Dhoni plays more attacking shots in the dressing room than he does in the ground,6
"i don't have any faith in csk now, its been so pathetic lately.",4
Du Plessis going for that orange cap.,7
It's funny how CSK fans still thinks it's achievable with 2 overs of Rabada left,6
So no Dhoni today also.. wonder what excuse he will give this time for not trying win the game for CSK.,4
"Watch closely kids. How the players make sure to hit the ball along the ground, regardless of match situation. That is what you call good technique!!",6
Excellent over for DC and a wicket,1
Idk what the fuck is goin on here,1
Kedhar Jadav yet to hit a six in this IPL like Vijay.,4
"Delhi Fans: We are almost through..

CSK Fans: We can still win.

Gambhir: Why didn't Dhoni bat at 4.",7
Aight boys who is next,1
NORTJE MY BOY WITH SOME REAL CLUTCH BOWLING,2
Thank you :),1
Anrich bowling amazingly well,1
"I don't want MS now, send Sam please",4
The way the Hindi commentators suck up to Dhoni is hilarious,11
Imagine a team scoring 2 points with an nrr of -0.05 at the end of tournament and blaming a potato for losing,2
Nokia ne kar dala,5
Pitch has become so much slower. Not a good idea to bat secindn,0
Time has come now ...Bois...,2
this game comes down to the first 10 overs being wasted by boomers,2
This CSK team is not only bad it is boring. Petition to bring back Rising Pune Supergiants ✍️,11
[deleted],4
Nortje and Rabada combo looks deadly af,1
"Oh fuck, shouldn't have appealed this one",5
Kedhar couldn't hit sixes even if his life depended on it.,4
Last year was all about 19.4 over finishes. This year they ain't gonna reach the target even after 39.4 overs,3
"Jadhav departs, big blow to Delhi",5
Vijay better not get another game . Always kills the momentum at the start.,3
Dhoni come in and swing ba,4
Lol Star Sports Tamil commentary roasting Kedar Jadhav,11
"Jadhav is dead weight. He doesn't have the power to hit sixes. And his role in team is a finisher. 

 I am sounding too harsh but it seems to me that way. Anyone have any opposing arguments.",6
Fuck off kedar Jadhav you fucking suck,14
Here comes lord Dhenier,5
Great wicket for csk,7
Nortje you beauty.,3
Scenes if Dhoni sends Jadeja next to bat,3
Nokia has beem really elite till now. What a great replacement pick he has been!,3
Who is this nortje and where was he all this time? What a gun bowler oooof,5
Send Curran please.,6
Scenes if wicket falls now and Dhoni does not come out to bat.,2
I'm calling it. This seasons winner are DC. Take the trophy already.,0
"Jadhav be so short,even if the ball hits his helmet,it's a LBW dismissal.",4
Csk fans are cheering this wicket.,5
Cant wait to reduce the quantomofloss,6
Funny how jadhav had a higher SR than faf,7
LETS GOOO GET OUT JADHAV,7
Chennai has forgotten that they gotta win some matches for the NRR to actually do anything,9
"If CSK batsmen are going to take their merry time settling in, they atleast need to rotate strike and run hard between the wickets to keep their strike rate up and run rate down. Its something Virat Kohli does so well, even if he isn't hitting boundaries he runs so hard between the wickets that he ends up with a 100+ strike rate and then the boundaries just bring it even higher.",6
Is this the worst CSK team of all time?,5
"Oh finally, we get to see Sam Curran now

E: Oh no don't do this Dhoni",2
get curran out here,3
Dhenier walking out!!,2
"Kedhar Jadhav career should end now, or may be loan hum to SRH on one end he could hold middle order for them.",10
"Only 2 games so far. But, Nortje has been a real find for us.. I hope he stays fit till the end.",8
Woakes replaced by Nortje was such a blessing for Delhi.,8
Nortje was Woakes’ replacement right?,3
Nrotje getting tips by the GOAT bowler Avesh Khan,4
jadhav finally listened to this thread,2
Who threw that direct hit?,2
Dhoni before Curran damn. Dhoni looks at comments in r/cricket confirmed.,7
"Right...Dhoni vs Rabada.

Get ready Bois",6
Bowling first seems a death sentence this year.,4
Dhoni holy shit !! He has INTENT,8
Dhoni haters have entered the chat,0
He practiced his shots!,2
If Dhoni comes I will stop smoking,10
plz dhoni come out to bat.,1
Quantum of defeat incoming,4
Sir Kedar Jadhav MOM for DC,4
Ok Dhoni’s in but probably too late,4
Jadhav was supposed to be the new finisher for India. But never lived up to the promise.,4
Someone tell them its a T20 game not ODI.,8
"Bruh even last season Dhoni can't do shit from here, stop hyping him up commentators.",4
He heard you r/Cricket lmaoo,8
"**15.4** Nortje to Jadhav, OUT, that is plumb lbw. The asking rate means he has to do something out of the ordinary, and Nortje is too good. Runs the fingers on a length ball that is headed straight for the stumps. Jadhav is looking to slog it and is beaten comprehensively. No question of a review **98-4**

KM Jadhav lbw b Nortje 26 (21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 123.80",2
Thala out to tap dots and 1s till last over.,5
yaaas! dhoni time.,1
How the fuck this happened dhoni promotion,3
MS in. r/cricket in shambles,13
Sad that kedar got out. happy that ms will come in.,3
Dhoni not out incoming.,2
"Just in - MSD is officially applying for a waiver for CSK after this match. Considering their age, IPL should discount 20% of runs when chasing. I hope Ganguly approves that to make these run chases more competitive.",5
"Haha, dhoni actually giving respect to gambhirs statement and 'promoting' himself to 6!",6
"Jadhav should have opened, he could have got the scoreboard ticking to start with.",3
Waiting for Dhoni to maintain NRR,2
Delhi team in shambles after getting their star player Jadhav out. This significantly hurts their chances of winning.,7
">Time for MSD to put on a special show

More like..his fans and others 🍿😉",3
Lmao would be fun to see the outrage if Curran walked out to bat rn,1
"Doesn’t bat

Doesn’t bowl

Average fielder at best

Guess who?",3
WE WANT CURRAN WE WANT CURRAN.,6
Get ready for NRR charge!,9
"Okay, Imma flip my shit if MS comes in before sam  


E- shit flipped",5
"They are slogging but unfortunately they aren't good enough.

Simple as that. Raina didn't came(I think he would have struggled too) Rayudu was there only hope who got injured and MSD has been shit for a while now.

He can only score against 130-135 kmph trundlers or off spinners. He isn't getting any of those in this match.

I can see CSK at the bottom of table this year.",7
We seem to be doing well at the moment,1
Shitposters cracking their knuckles,10
"Fantastic

Dhoni is gonna make the RRR go to >36 and then starting hitting 6s",14
Should've sent Curran but nah,5
rabada to dhoni.. will be niceeee,3
Ahahahahahaha no Curran. We win!!!,2
Faf: “if we see off this tricky period we can capitalize after tea”,8
Atleast come and slog now for fuck sake.,2
Dhenier!,2
"Don't worry CSK fans, Dhoni will hit 20 off the last over when the game is already lost and there is no pressure on to lose by 18 runs :)",3
How many last over sixes today?,2
Most runs scored to win in final five overs batting second in IPL history are 77 by CSK v RCB in 2012. They need 81 tonight. CSK let's play for NRR then,6
Csk gonna end up last in the points table this time with highest NRR,9
"Dhoni Comes out and not Sam or Jadeja.

What is this, Euphoria?",4
Imagine dhoni got out in 10 balls,4
"Dhoni nice

F",5
In comes MSD,2
"Honestly I thought Raina was replaceable after poor performances in the last couple of seasons but damn, we're terrible without him.",5
So Jadhav was picked instead of Raina for the CWC. Ok,2
The thing about Jadhav is that he rarely completely screws up but he very rarely takes complete control and wins the game by himself.,3
Expectations subverted again. Dhoni instead of Curran,3
Dhoni out to science haters with that finger in ears celebration,5
3 runs per ball. Looks diffic,5
fuck off dhoni haters.,-1
Finally jadhav is gone!  Wish he never bats again for csk. Never seen him perform once barring that first match vs mi in 2018,3
"Dhoni: Even Curran can't save us at this point realistically, might as well try to silence the critics and come out before #7 lol.",5
RRR 18.. gonna be gud.,3
Dhoni need to hit from ball 1,3
"That is really poor cricket from CSK, at least show some intent like rcb or kkr to win",4
"Ffs Dhoni. For once, this is not the time for you to be coming in further up the order",8
So what the prediction 6 of first 9 or 9 of first 6 ?,5
Crowd going wild for Dhoni,4
Impossible,1
It's tuktuk time,3
That was wide!!,6
Scenes if Dhoni gets out with single digits,2
"In comes an awkward front foot defence, * not",0
145 kmph bumper to Dhoni straight up,3
"Everyone is expecting MS Dhoni to tee off the get go but we really know what's going to happen. Dots and singles to begin with, some flurry of boundaries and then single to end.",2
God damn. Indians fans are not giving Dhoni an inch.,3
Cant decide if i wanna say nice or F,4
"Interviewer: Do you think Dhoni cost your team this match too?

Vijay: Dhoni? He’s the fall guy, I’m the brains of this organization.",14
Man I think we might be shit this season,5
"This time Dhoni not promoting Sam Curran

Fear of missing out customary sixers in last over",2
Did Kedhar not take the review out of fear that it may be a Not Out?,2
That was heck of the bouncer,3
I hope after this season Dhoni and Fleming don't divorce!,5
Cmon Delhi you're not allowed to have TWO amazing overseas Pacers,11
"They need 13 sixes in 26 balls

Easy peasy

Only need a 50% success rate

How hard could it be lmao",19
Dhoni can farm the strike  and avoid the follow on.,14
Are we in Quantum of loss zone,8
After this ipl I am just growing to hate dhoni more and more even though he is a legend,3
Iyer will give Avesh the ball so Dhoni can save face by having a good strike rate. Otherwise how bad will it look when your team needs 78 of 26 and you can’t get bat on ball,7
That was some good running,4
That wasn’t wide?,1
"first 3 run, in the so called big ground",7
Match was lost when we scored just 47 in first 10 tbh,9
Daily Mark Nicolas appreciation comment ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ,8
dhoni finally here,3
this CSK batting has killed Bravo's happiness,8
INTENT.,1
Waiting for a masterclass 7(9) from Dhoni,1
"This must be what it feels like to be a Delhi fan

Jk, you guys are far superior and have a very exciting team",4
Dhoni's running between the wickets is of next level.,10
Intent intensifies!,3
Brilliant over by nortje,3
Hahaha he doesn't know when to come in,2
**150 SR**,3
Hetmyer is so fucking slow,4
"Dhoni comes to bat.

r/cricket - should have sent Sam Curran.

*Dhoni confused noises*",29
150 s/r take that haterzzzz,11
CSK literally throwing. Check Gurunath pls.,1
Dhoni galloping at 150 SR. Take that haters.,8
Outstanding from Nortje!,2
Dhoni left the same ball at WC semi finals.,4
r/cricket in shambles looking at that 150 sr,3
So the 39 year old runs better than India’s choice for no. 4 in the CWC,7
Dhoni is already showing intent. He wont be any worse than Vijay or Gaekwad :-),4
"If stoinis can bowl and Ashwin comes in for avesh , DC has the best bowling attack in the tournament",7
Dhoni 3(2) strike rate 150 why all the outrage guys,6
"When Ishant comes back, Delhi will have an amazing pace battery. AND an amazing spin attack of Ashwin, Axar and Mishra!",3
"""On this blessed day, everyone is a Dhoni"" - CSK batsmen today",5
"Could be the first year they dont make the semis csk, too lackluster",1
Scenes if CSK win from this situation,2
Dugout here with the master’s thesis on Dhoni,3
Double Agent Hetmeyer should really try to be more subtle.,7
What team changes you guys see except Vijay being replaced?,4
How on earth did CSK manage to mess this up so badly. I was watching live but I still can’t understand,5
19 per over is nothing wait for 36+,4
"Chuteye faf ko mat thaka abhi, bohot bar thakaya hai tune virat ko.",4
TFW Jadhav’s “risk” is simply trying to hit the ball. Fuck all shot.,3
150 strike rate just like that boys.,3
"Go with RR tactics, win the match in next 3 overs and leave unachievable for last and throw it to Avesh/Stoinis",4
Goddamn atleast it’s interesting to see RCB play. CSK are out here playing a test match not even able to score 100 in 16 overs,8
They gotta bowl hell lot of extras now,4
Man cricket is the only place where I can say 75 of 24 seems doable but also not. What the fuck.,9
PLEASE SMACK AVESH,2
Imagine Ms chasing this down on his own,4
no worries. GOAT finisher at the crease.,3
Dhoni should go after Avesh,3
Please don't send avesh now,3
Murali Vijay is not even the test opener for India anymore and CSK have him as their T20 opener.,2
Will CSK win the wooden spoon this year?,2
Mark Nicholas trying to be his usual over poetic self hoping CSK Sivaramakrishnan won't bite his head off!,1
CSK finally facing consequences of getting a Senior citizens team last mega auction.,6
Now watch as csk end up qualifying in 4th by nrr and ending up as runners up. You heard it here first,3
Seriously what the fuck. Why would you give avesh the over,8
CSK needs to drop Vijay and Ruturaj next match. Period.,7
Just got back to watching it. How did they slow down so much with faf in there? Dhoni just got here.,4
Impossible,4
"At this rate, I'm just making money for Star Sports by just watching Advertisements without enjoying the match.",7
🚨🚨BOOOOM 🚨🚨,3
This over gonna blow up,2
Dhoni's ego is hurt now,2
Why anvesh why not stonis dc fuck this up,2
"3 off 2 deliveries, better strike rate than 100",2
Avesh is going to get absolutely clobbered here. 25 bare minimum coming.,2
"Literally the only this they had to do is not bowl Avesh

Literally",3
What the fuck is up with CSK?,3
One over of avesh khan left,1
It’s Dhenier time!,2
Don't do that Dhoni... don't give us hope,6
That was sexy,2
Rabada & Nortje will make a formidable pace attack for SA in the next T20I WC.,2
Thala is hitting,3
Avesh ahead of Rabada lol. wtf is Iyer smoking,3
Why Avesh again.. should have been Stoinis.,1
Reverse jinx..?,1
Avesh Khan getting ready for a 25 run over,1
INTENT,3
Don’t fucking bowl avesh ffs. Save his over till the end when it’ll be impossible mathematically to win,2
Can anyone tell me what the words in the Dhoni chant is please ?,1
"Dhoni 7*(3)

Did he get runs and balls confused?",10
"Vijay , gaikwad and jadhav need to get their shit together and do something .",3
Why the fuck is Avesh khan bowling now? Defensive much?,2
Stoinis should've been better,2
**SR 233**,7
SR > 200.,2
Why is Avesh bowling this!!!!! Finish the innings with rabada and nortje,2
Avesh pies,2
amazing how there's still hope when this man comes out to bat.,1
"If Avesh gets hit for less than 15, its a guaranteed win for DC",7
are we gonna see something special? no,3
Dhoni dedicating this inning to all of us haters lol,4
Dhoni is way over time on his cricketing abilities. It’s painful to watch for the last 4 years but this year CSK have real problems. Vijay and Gaikwad won’t cut it as your opener and number 4. Watson at this point is a neutral to your team and not an asset because of his age.,-2
Lord avesh,1
Good of Shreyas helping out the old codgers,3
Bad decision this,3
"Hold on a sec, Dhoni does not have a sr less than 100 whaaaat",5
"It's not impossible for CSK yet. If only they had the quartet of Unadkat, Umesh, Dinda and Siraj to bowl to them.",4
"Commentators are still hoping MS to chase 71 in 22. Cmon mates, what u smoking?",6
[deleted],0
Avesh should have bowled lasr over,1
[deleted],9
"avesh, why?",3
All these cricket nerds crunching the numbers and it turns out the way to win a game is simply batting first,5
How the fuck CSK is top of fair play when Dhoni visibly questions so many umpiring calls?,9
Dhoni looking for wides on every bouncer lmao,5
Hurt is Dhoni's ego now,4
Dhenier looks serious,6
"Strike rate above 200

Take that haters",3
Dhoni hits 1four to avesh Khan and hindi commentators loses their mind.,8
Dhoni saw Gambhir's spiel it seems,3
"Off topic but media houses in India can fuck off 

They twisted the entire meaning of Sunny G's remarks !",9
Dw guys even russel can't win them this now,5
"Guys, did we just meme intent into Dhoni?",15
KP's confident that MS will finish this match. I'm now pretty confident that Delhi's gonna win this match,10
The only thing Kedar Jadhav has offered to this CSK team in the last two years is dancing to the Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan ad tune.,11
Current Strike rate of 233 by MS Dhoni..r/cricket in absolute shock,11
can’t they bowl stoinis idk spice things up a lil,3
Guys Dhoni just used the last match as practice,11
What happened to Stoinis?,3
Dhoni shoukd have come in instead of Jadhav. Dhoni could have had his 10 ball warmup. But Jadhav wasted so much and did nothing,14
Lol why is Dhoni umpiring?,12
"Avesh getting some good experience here in a situation where even if he goes for 15, it is way below par. Good on Iyer to trust him for this task.",6
What are you doing MS? This is a test game!!,7
That smile,1
Not winning this one too,5
Tuk tuk express at his best,5
Wow 2 dot balls from avesh,7
Ah 2 balls wasted,6
Hetmyer was a specialist fielder today eh?,2
Good thinking from avesh coming around the wicket,2
20 of 50 so hard here they have 70,2
forget everything. I want to see the look on faf's face when MS came out to bat,3
Called it. Iyer will Avesh so Papa Dhoni won’t look like the hack he has become.,-2
I am not surprised by how shit our team is. In the last mega auction we bought to win now and sacrificed our future. We won a chip and and got to the finals once. Now that “future” has come. We will need to rebuild,2
This time there's no question of intent but the bowling is just too good :(,9
Going as per Dhoni's script.,4
Why didnt csk get a replacement for raina and harbhajan? Does that mean raina will join back at some point of time?,5
This is depressing,1
Question to CSK fans: When was the last time Kedar Jadhav scored anything of value? Haven't seen him bowl in eons and haven't seen him score either for a long time. Why is he in the team?,4
RIP people questioning Pant’s batting style ahead of this shitshow,4
"THELA will not run only boundaries

  


Love you ❤️ THELLA",5
Giving Avesh an over here instead of Rabada is a pretty risky move by Iyer,1
Dhoni strike rate collapses to 120,5
2 dot balls. Fucking Dhoni this is why you should have come in earlier. You could have comfortably had those before. But now only 24 balls left,3
Lord Avesh with his blessings.,3
That's rubbish bowling. Was a wide!,4
70 from 20 balls would be a world record for sure.,4
You wanna win IPL ? Bat first,8
Shit bowling,4
Well.. that strategy didn't work. Obviously,1
"Why are people surprised about Avesh bowling an over? If the game is definitely won by DC, then why not let Avesh bowl a bit. Can't just pick a frontline bowler and hide his overs somewhere. How do you expect players to grow then",8
Dhots,7
CSK needs a senior citizen quota. Their target should be trimmed down by 10% in every match.,18
Better than a wide and then four i guess,5
"Cmon, should have bowled Stoinis",7
Dhoni ne kya shot mara bhenchod! - Kapil Dev,14
Jadhav tryna be mini Dhoni but ended up being Pujara,9
AWESH STOP MAKING DHONI LOOK GOOD.,15
The guy to blame for this loss is Kedar Jadhav playing tuk tuk cricket. Should've sent in form Curran earlier. Dhoni at 6 or 7 doesn't change the result now.,4
Can't we have Ishant back already,2
Dhoni needs to pull a KL Rahul here,4
Anyone who still has hope in CSK is a bhakt.,14
Old Dhoni would have clobbered that ball over long off.,4
Avesh can you bowl the last 2 deliveries and not spray them?,4
Damn this is sad to watch,6
CSK gonna create a new record this IPL. The best NRR for team @ no 8.,8
OMG THAAALA 🥵 WHAT A DOT BALL,5
Bench his ass for the rest of the season. He's clearly graduated from the Dinda Academy.,-2
"r/cricket: Announces death to batsman if they play slow.

also r/cricket: Announces player owned r/cricket after they hit couple by the rope.",7
Thala will start refusing single and will in single handedly for DC,3
Can Csk pull this off?,1
Why isn't Sam Curran being sent in to make things happen,2
Commentators trying too much to hype up Dhoni. The match is dead. He is gonna play for NRR,9
Did they just pull a nets bowler and bring him to the team?,0
For some reason all the CSK players look depressed af this season! Maybe social bubble did that to them?,12
66 off 19 balls with 12 balls remaining from Rabada!,7
4-5 saal pehle chakka mar deta,0
Missed the full toss,2
I can hit a boundary to trash like that Avesh.,10
Merko toh aisa dhak dhak ho re la h,5
"Not at all bad over by Avesh, he really got unlucky today, otherwise could had 2 wickets",5
thala fans incoming,7
How many sixes will dhoni hit in the last over?,2
Why is that idiot bowling full tosses?,4
Hindi Commentators have about the same credibility as Republic TV,10
I think CSK needs to get rid of Vijay first and foremost. Open with Faf and Watson and hopefully have Rayudu fit for the middle order,8
Why does the commentator keep bigging up Dhoni? Dhoni is no good as a batsman anymore.,7
Max 15 runs this over. Is good enough,2
How sick would it be if MS turned back the clock though,9
"Fair play to him, Dhoni does at least look like he's trying to win this one",18
Delhi seriously lack an indian pace bowler (absence of ishant) who can concede less than 10 an over,4
Jaddu is padded up and out in front ready to go wtf? Surely Sam would be in next.,6
"Ok that was alright, 10s not bad",12
However good a innings Dhoni plays. 75 from 24 are impossible. Once in a season miracles.,7
Lol what a shit game,1
Decent over given RRR,5
That would be wide if he left it,4
"Name: Shimron Hetmeyr 

Role: Specialist Deep Mid-wicket fielder",7
"Guys, how fast is Avesh bowling? Is it 140+ kph?",2
It's difficult to understand what's going through avesh khan's mind - man am i so shit that dhonis smacking me,5
I can't wait for tomorrow's Eoin Morgan Appreciation thread,1
Awesome over!!,1
"Dhoni supports the Indian army. If you criticize dhoni, you're anti-national. That's quite bad tbh.",12
10 runs this over is perfect from avesh tbh,3
Don't think Dhoni's last inning was worth showcasing though. Lol.,2
Avesh Khan was okay overall to be fair.,6
22 runs per over. Where rabada has 2 left,3
"Why have teams been so bad at chasing? These are world class chasers, but not one team has paced their innings well.",5
Get rid of Vijay please,5
"65 in 3 is definitely doable and has been done, but not in a 100 years with this lineup",2
Get close to the target and protect NRR :),2
NCB needs to investigate what CSK is high on.,6
When was the last time you guys remember anyone score 66 of the last 3? Maybe Russel last season?,5
'50 to chase in last 3 overs' was made possible by CSK in 2019. That bar ain't going to be pushed any higher any time soon,5
Why the fuck was avesh khan bowling when dhoni has come out to bat and he is clearly the worst of the lot. These are decisions which lead to fixing allegations.,-2
"65 off 18. 

Dhoni to win with 7 balls to spare.",3
"one doubt. Are the people in the audience fans of team staff? 
Team staff most probably, but still want to get that question out of my mind.",1
"aight lads, ima head out! enjoy the banter!",1
Basically need almost a 4 every ball now. Hope Dhoni takes it deep.,2
Is Avesh a proud member of Dinda academy as well?,0
How have the csk fans not started chain downvoting yet? Clearly rcb fans are more retarded,5
A Rabada over should seal the game,3
"Good thing Avesh finished it well, 22 runs needed per over. One over going less than 12 is delhi's game",5
I just saw an ad in which dhoni is eating noodles and after finishing he says clean bowled,4
It would have been a six but tHiS iS nOT 2011 dHoNI,0
"Needs more than 20 runs each over....

MSD scores 9....

Commentators: OMG he's dangerous man.

Stop hyping him man. Peak Dhoni in 2015 couldn't score 9 runs of last over against rabada.",-1
"Just like KL Rahul played out Chahal so he could smash Umesh, Dube and Saini at the end yesterday, CSK are playing out Axar Patel so they could smash Rabada.",9
Faf's been incredible this season so far,2
"Dhoni seriously needs to promote himself. Their third best batsman after Rayudu and faf. Csk need to trim their batting. Watson, vijay and gaikwad are liabilities. 

Let jadeja and Curran take more of a finisher role and let actual batsman fill the role from 1-4.",4
"I don't even know why should i be supporting this team now, it's so so pathetic.",7
"Somehow even with a smaller, more achievable target we find ourselves with an impossible task yet again.",6
RRR is 21,1
hahahaha,2
Someone has to delete vijay off csk,3
LMAO HEYTMYER,2
Fuck me in the ass yaar,1
**Khatabook Reminder**: *required run rate is 21.67*,1
Shitmeyer,1
FFS HETMYER,1
You fucking donkey V2.0,2
Lmao shitmyer at it again,2
Bhen ki C tumhari,3
Hetmyer is clutching straws!,1
I feel like we're perfectly setup for Dhoni to score 250 runs this IPL with a million not outs and demand to be let into the WC squad with his average of 70,1
Fucking drop that cunt,1
Hetmyer= Butterfingers.,1
Hetmeyer you donkey,2
Hetmyer is play in like RCB,2
Specialist fielder Shitmyer,2
Specialist fielder Hetmyer can't even catch smh,2
LMAO Hetmyer what a noob,2
Shimron Kohli,3
Hetmeyr pulling of a kohli,4
Madarchod Shimran!!!!,1
We definitely have to do a proper rebuilding for next season. I don’t have much hopes this season due to our usual mantra of spin not looking like it will work,1
faf scoring 50s in every match.,-1
Over didn't go big but this was a inexperienced decision. Dhoni cherishes on such bowlers. Had it been Rohit or Dhoni they would have bowled their best bowlers,2
SHITmeyer,2
"Chutiya hairsyle, Chutiya fielder.",0
PLS TALK ABOUT HIS HAIRSTYLE.,1
YOURE NOT STILL IN RCB YOU DUMBFUCK,5
"Not easy, chal maaf kiya :)",1
Lolol,1
This is just atrocious fielding in this IPL. Absolutely horrifying.,1
"Dhoni will play all the middling easily and then will struggle against a good player like rabada, then twitter will be like rabada next steyn took the game away congrats champ not telling dhoni is at fault.",5
There is 5 x 5 feet hole in the outfield !!,1
Upcoming crazy action on r/cricket about Dhoni and CSK.,2
Agent Shemron,5
can't take the rcb out of someone...,7
Hetmyer is not having the best game. Feel bad for him.,3
Can Hetmeyer catch at least one,4
"LoL.

That's all.",5
Hetmyer has learnt well from kohli.,4
Alex Carey for Hetmyr FFS,2
DC is still missing one good indian seamer. And one good allrounder. I don't rate Stoinis highly.,1
RABADA,3
You can take the player out of RCB but you can't take the RCB out of the player.,9
Lol it's so tragic it's funny now,2
Fucking shit fielding so far this tournament,2
Rabada is gun!,3
Dropmyer,2
Hetmyer pulling a Kohli,1
Shitmeyer,2
Hell yeah rabada!!,2
HEYTMYER & KOHLI used to field together,3
Rabada Pro. Faf out. Thank goodness.,1
Dhoni has to come in at 4. I don’t see why he doesn’t and they stick with Jadhav instead of a proper bowler. Already bat till 8 with Jadeja and Curran after this,3
finally someone can hold to Faf's catch,3
Rest in peace du plessis,2
Du plessis was crap,-2
Rabada you beauty..,1
"Man I feel so angry when I see Vijay. But he's not the only one, except Faf every one of our batsmen has been utter shit",2
Simron Hetmyer: How to drop catches 101,3
The Impostor,2
Thoppai,1
That's luck number 9 for faf,6
Bring back Hetmyar to RCB.,5
Yep. Hetmeyer is a donkey.,-1
faf is playing the scratchiest inning ever,4
 HETMYER,1
Shimron is doing it intentionally Gaizzzzzz,2
You can run but you can't hide from Rabada,4
Sam ! Sam! Sam!,0
I am convinced all of Delhi players have Faf in their fantasy team,4
"Fortunately, Hetmyer has dropped two in a winning cause",4
Super over wickets count for purple cap?,0
I love fake crowd excitement for singles off inaide edges,3
The ball seems to be following hetmyer,0
Gone,1
Rabada is the future.,3
"Hetmyer perfect tribute to his ex- captain, the Koach.",2
Why the hell are captains choosing to field first when the pitch is slowing down like this in every single match?,3
Guess that cinches it,1
Hetmyer being a kohli today,1
Hetmeyer introducing a new tiktok dance.,1
"Can't blame dhoni now, seems like no one has been able to time the ball on this pitch. Biggest issue last game was lack of IntentTM but dhoni has shown intent here, there was just too much left to do",7
FINALLLLLLYYYYYYTTT,1
crushing win for DC. I really like this team. Hope they continue to play consistent. KXP fizzled out last year after a great start.,3
We are seeing strong competition between Hetmeyer and Kohli.,3
Dhoni gonna shit on the top order for not taking up responsibility!,3
Time to sleep,2
"Fucking  hell, Hetmyer can't even catch tiddies in an orgy.",12
Hetmyer felt like humpty dumpty while taking the catch,3
Press F for CSK,6
Hetmyer still inspired from ex cap Vk,3
"Everyone except Faf have seem to forgotten how to catch, smh.",3
Can’t overlook all these missed catches just cuz we’re winning,6
Thick ass and thick skull too.,1
"Hetmeyer  ... you just dropped  .... ""nothing really"".",10
Rabada you beauty,7
Hetmyer : How many ctaches can I drop before I am dropped.,6
Hetmeyer just pulled a kohli by missing two absolute sitters.,5
Faf goes out with a worse SR than Jadhav,1
rabada wins!,1
"I Sus Shimron, vote him out guys, he's impo.",5
Fuck man! Take the damn catches,1
"**17.2** Rabada to du Plessis, OUT,  **113-5**

F du Plessis c &dagger;Pant b Rabada 43 (35b 4x4 0x6) SR: 122.85",1
"I somehow have even less excitement in watching CSK this year than normal. Who wakes up and looks forward to watching Vijay, Du Plessis and Jadhav bat?",3
"Fuck csk, why tf are they so jaded this ipl",5
Hetmyer thinks he's still in RCB,7
"With this batting , dont think CSK will reach play-offs",3
At least you tried?,3
ILL SUPPORT RCB OVER THIS SHIT TEAM ANYDAY!,6
"How do CSK fix this mess?

Open with Gaikwad, bring in a middle order bat?

Bowling hasn't been that bad right?",2
CRED ads are low key cringy,5
I think Srini mama is going to make the call to Raina tonight.,3
So wrong of dhoni to get du plessis out,1
Hetmyer on a hattrick,3
Everyone got a brain KP.,3
"This team is shit. Can neither bowl, bat nor field.",4
Faf was struggling today,2
"Hetmyer: Virat, I am with you.",9
"KG has a brain - KP, 2020",8
Fine I'll do it myself,3
at least he showed INTENT™,5
Hetmyer please go have a word with punter later on,2
"Is this a historical moment in the IPL, never seen CSK in such a dire state before.",9
Best player is out. CSK are turning out to be the meme team of the tournament now 🤪,9
Why ipl doesn't have English commentators or Ian smith,2
"Jaddu go back, Sam needs to be out here what the fuck.",4
"If your 4th overseas is Hetmeyer, might as well just play 3.",3
F for CSK,2
Why didnt sam come up?,2
Next mega auction will be very interesting. MI will want to be allowed to retain as many players as possible but CSK will want other teams to release as many players possible. Will be interesting to see which team will be favored by the rules.,2
Who do I make myself suffer,5
No Curran?,2
CSK are sorely missing the Chepauk advantage,3
Rabada is a fucking beast,2
"Rayadu in place of gaikwad , so who will replace Vijay?",-1
"Even if Csk lose today, they will still somehow make it to playoffs. Unless 2020 jinxes them of course",2
I'd would like to see how CSK stans defend this chase,5
Don't understand why Curran wasn't sent in up the order,5
Idk why the teams insist on chasing when literally every match is going to the ones who bat first,5
WE ARE WINNING THIS YEARS IPL.,7
Faf might actually break his back by the end of this season carrying this team.,4
Lmao they don't send Sam when you need him,7
A minute to appreciate Pant. He’s been a total boss with the gloves. Not to mention the vocal entertainment.,12
He has a brain and uses it...,2
Kohli=hetmyer,1
How good faf has been for csk ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ,2
"When you make room to hit the ball, watch Andre Russell, his head is always still, never drags it leg side with the leg. Faf's body is going with him when he makes room, so that he'll always get an outside edge. It's why Russell can hit through covers despite opening up. Small things!",4
KP chatting some absolute carp as per,1
You can take Hetmeyer out of RCB but you can't take the RCB out of Hetmeyer,5
Game over. Looks like we are gonna be the next meme for this season. 2020 eh,3
Jadeja over Curran? Get fucked CSK. Fuck off.,9
If CSK wins this I'll commit suicide,1
wtf Jadeja over curran,5
CSK are no match for DC. Can we play against better teams?,1
"Getting worried about dew is not a valid reason to bowl, when u have EXPERIENCED bowlers like csk u should be able to deal with it",-1
Why jadeja why not curran?,4
nooo curran is perfect for some quick hitting.,2
"Jadeja before Curran? Tf is this lineup

Edit : He just hit a four.",3
CSK is cooked. When's the auction again?,1
Why not Sam? Why Jadeja?,4
Boom boom sam where'ya at?,2
WHERE THE FUCK IS SAM CURRAN YOU DUMBCUNTS,2
WHY IS CURRAN NOT HERE,4
Take strike Thala...!!!?,2
Safe to say we're in the quantum of loss mode now.,2
We would have lost our first match too if not for Rayudu.,2
Hetmeyer shox Rabada rox,4
Atleast Dhoni is hitting 4s in the commercials,2
dhonis captaincy this ipl is mind boggling,0
this set up to be FINISHING OFF IN STYLE /s,2
"RCB - Meme team

CSK - Intent team",6
"Lol csk are using this as middle practice for Jadeja

No sane person would send him above Curran",7
"Just sub Hetmyer for one of the better fielders on the bench, how is this so hard",6
This CSK team is so boring but good thing is for next 1 week they won't play a match 😁,5
No Curran still?,2
I’m late but here’s my obligatory “I love Rabada” comment,5
Aluma Doluma playing in the background at least has given me something to smile about.,6
Who's abso-fucking-lute bonkers idea is to win the toss and bowl first this IPL. And Where's the fucking dew,10
Damn how good is rabada,4
Dhoni and Jadeja batting together just makes me sad these days,5
The only reason I can think of for Dhoni not batting higher is that he doesn't want to face spin.,4
No Sam Curran at this point is pretty much admitting defeat,11
Why send in an uncapped player when you have established players who can deliver ?That was shit captaincy tbh.,1
Where is Sam Karan?,1
It seems MI gonna win this season.,3
dhoni we know you are picasso of backing the right talent. ARE YOU BLIND WHILE LOOKING AT VIJAY!?!,9
Is there a 'mega auction' next year?,2
Is Curran injured?,2
What happened to Rayudu? What injury?,0
Only 6 sixes can give us a chance,2
In b4 dhoni and jadeja play for net run rate,3
WC Jadeja,-1
Wonder how long captains will keep choosing to bowl  first?,1
Hetmeyer more like Hitmehere,2
"CSK's decision making has been terrible. Should have sent Curran at 4 to hit at the spinners, now he won't get to bat.",8
KP speaks like he's on /r/Cricket match threads - completely agricultural in commentary.,8
Forgive me Rabada for I have called you kabada for the past 3 years.,1
RJ Balaji commentary is the only reason I'm still watching this,8
Only need like 30 rpo boys,7
Csk won the first match only because of the MI first match crisis.,21
"“What did you have to sacrifice to get 1 win against MI?”

CSK: “Everything”",25
Sam curran and watto to open in next game.,9
"This is a situation where KKR of 2019 would normally send Andre Russell, and tell him to make all the runs.",21
"So 4 ~~an over~~ per ball, required... *gives thumbs-up*",6
Even fours won't work at this stage. Amazing how well DC has done as an entire bowling unit.,5
Very nice,3
I dont understand why this team doesnt take risks they have jaddu curran hazlewood to come? They dont even try to stay in the game,9
"14x6= 84. 

Simple.",10
A boundary every ball,7
I think CSK has hit their age plateau this season,6
And that seals the game for DC,3
quantum of loss routine activated,3
F for people thinking CSK will hit 57 in 14 balls!,14
"Play for win? No thanks.

Play for NRR? Real shit.",7
"Take off your mask, Kohli. We know its you.",4
25 per over ? We need two virat kohli overs then,1
If anybody can finish this game now it's dhoni. Only he can give csk an win today.,-8
"No Curran...lol..
Captain wise!!",5
This is the worst fielding I have seen in the IPL since the season when Ganguly  played for Pune Warriors.,5
One of Vijay or Watson’s got to go for CSK. The starts are not coming.,7
CSK management is brain dead. They do know Curran is yet to bat?,13
Hope tomorrow's game is a close one. Last few days have seen some boring run chases.,7
Has there been an IPL when CSK hasn't made it to playoffs? (Ofcourse considering only when they played),11
[deleted],6
I hope akash chopra is ready with another article soon.,14
I'm feeling sleepy,6
Alteast CSK are trying to maintain their net run-rate,11
Boundary every ball = easy CSK win,8
It seems so absurd to watch Jadhav or Dhoni just knock around and run a single when the rr is 20,0
NrR,2
CSK fans will be more happier than winning the IPL the day CSK drops Murali Vijay and Kedar Jadhav from the playing XI.,14
They ran 1 smh,3
We’re getting into Stick Cricket levels of required run rate now,9
"Are the commentators not allowed to criticize CSK or something? Jadeja blocks a ball to mid wicket and they're like ""Good single"".",13
Great shitposting with you guys. I am gonna cry myself to sleep tonight.,15
Stoinis to bowl?,3
Now watch thala hit 3 sixes in the last over,13
"RRR reaching 28. Dhoni agrees, some aggression might be needed now.",16
Dhoni can't have Curran in his fantasy team.,10
That was some good fielding,6
Very thin line differentiates CSK and RCB.,13
30+25 and you win ok?,5
Easiest win ever for DC,4
CSK using these games to get the match fitness and sharpness to finish last this season,7
55 in 2. CSK's game to lose,8
"Thank God Dhoni is retired from the Indian team, his ideas seem to have gone so outdated that watching it is an eyesore.",5
Let's hope we don't see a run out today,3
I think CSKs strategy of not losing too badly and damaging their NRR forgets the fact that you have to get some points,9
At least CSK knows the importance of NRR unlike RCB,3
ok 5 sixes and a single ez clap,4
Binga has started to look like David Bowie when he played Nikola Tesla in Prestige,3
One 36 run over and you just need 20 of the another over.,4
Let’s not give the last over to Rabada if it’s mathematically impossible to win to save him for teams who actually care to win.,8
Come playoffs time and this will all pay off!,4
Very enthusiastic running between the wickets,5
"The Dhoni hate train ...ain't gonna stop soon !!
With such mind boggling decisions.",4
12 fours and a last ball helicopter six from thala,4
At least no one can shit on Dhoni for not trying so far,13
"28 RRR.

 EzPz for Dhoni.",10
"Csk is just 120 in 18 overs.

The batting looks so washed out. Except for Faf.",11
"4 key players missing from this squad  raina , rayadu , bravo , bhajji , no wonder they are in shambles.",5
 Come on Dhoni. It’s reducing the quantum of loss time.,9
Inb4 Thala's 5 boundaries to lose just by 30 runs,3
At least RCB tried last night,10
Will Star sports finally stop jerking off Dhoni?,2
55 in 12 is out of reach even for Dinda Academy bowlers,4
Place bet here on CSK's win.,2
But muh nrr,1
"should've run two, bruh.",0
Hetmeyer clearly has Faf as his fantasy team captain today,2
Lol they always show this Dhoni stat. Strike rate of 228 in last 2 overs.,3
Hopefully we move on quickly from Gaikwad. Who else we got,2
Old Dhoni pls come back make these last two overs into the best two overs ever seen,3
Watch Dhoni hit 4 useless sixes in the last over when they need 40 off 6,8
Dhoni is showing intent today but Rabada isn't Umesh Yadav.,8
Never been more relaxed to see a Nokia over,3
Can we be logical and not add the crowd noise. The game is literally dead and so would be the crowd.,5
I have so mcuh Respect now for Dhoni since he has actually come to the firing line. Its okay to fail but its not okay to hide,2
Wasn't CSK's owner arrested for fixing/betting years back?,2
Has there been worst team than this CSK in IPL ever?,1
What an absolute snooze fest. Starting to hate the CSK team.,2
Is there anyone in this sub who watches Anupamaa on Hotstar? What do you guys think?,0
This is mind boggling stuff from Dhoni. He comes out like he's gonna do something to help win but he doesn't hit and keeps Sam Curran who can hit waiting in the wings Jesus Christ,-1
"2016 Dhoni couldn't score 10 an over off rabada

2020 Dhoni sure as hell isn't scoring even 20 off rabada's last over",6
[deleted],2
Will do Delhi's NRR wonders after that 0.00 against KXIP,3
"FUCK YOU AND YOUR MENTAL GYMNASTICS, COMMENTATORS. 

Stop sucking CSK and Dhoni's dick. Call it out for what it is. This is a disgraceful performance, way worse than what they pulled off against RR, which in itself was atrocious.",12
Nice jadeja now prop up my fantasy points,2
csk make every game boring af. ill just skip csk game days.,2
"As a Delhite i'll say it, Behanchod",7
[deleted],4
this csk will keep losing some matches and suddenly they will make through to play offs.,9
[deleted],10
Dhoni SHOULD HAVE come so much earlier. Dude actually looks in good touch.,7
This is really insipid.,4
Sometimes I feel like while chasing CSK are keeping NRR in-mind first and then the win,2
Csk dont even have a proper batsman on the bench. Probably give N Jagadeesan a chance,2
Thala pls hit helicopter shot,2
At least run a 2 ffs,2
Pant showing his captain moves to MSD.,5
"Pre-match, Dhoni said it looks easy to chase on this ground on the TV and teams chasing have made a lot of mistakes.",2
Good looking shot for single.,1
Quantum of loss batting by Dhoni.,2
This Delhi 11 is insanely good. All their players are in their prime are international quality. With good backups like Carey Rahane Daniel Sams Mishra for Ashwin. Only weakling is Mohit / Avesh.,4
You know Dhoni has given up because he's not refusing singles. If he was planning on winning he'd just stay and only hit boundaries.,7
Playing for points too mainstream for CSK. They play for NRR instead,6
9 sixes of 11 balls,2
Dhoni at 4 next game,4
Shikhar Dhawan’s glasses are much more interesting that today’s chase,7
Wow THELLA .. such intent much wow,1
End of an era for CSK,2
10 balls 10 sixes. Still doable.,6
"This team needs better opener, better middle over batsmen and better spinners",2
In B4 Dhoni hits 3 or 4 useless sixes and his fans shag off to sleep,7
"Out of form vijay a certain concern for csk management though.. they are failing to give a good start and again, dhoni isn't even showing intent",2
oh ffs... they've gone and lost it.,3
"Why the fuck would they send Gaikwad and then JADHAV after he got out when they have Curran. And Dhoni.

This is not rhetorical, I really want to know, can anyone explain what could they possibly be thinking lol",2
This is gonna be a good 24 hrs watching ppl fight about Dhoni,2
Iyer did everything right in captaincy. CSK have got to stop shooting themselves in the foot. This is unnecessary pressure. Just keep the strike going at least if you don't want to hit boundaries. Those test cricket leaves at the front were ridiculous.,3
Well haha nice win csk /s,1
Dhawan starting to look like Ranveer Singh,4
"What do we lose our minds about now ?


NRR^TM isn't working for us",2
There should be a Worst Sunglasses award given to Dhawan at the end of this,2
Congrats dc,2
"I am gonna ask it once more.

""Where is the fuckin'  INTENT?""",7
WTF are Shikhar Dhawan's shades?,3
Lol why are they running singles,6
5.3 runs per ball.,5
i think hazlewood is gonna have to go so thakur bravo and rayudu can come in for vijay gaikwad,7
Damn it feels like forever since our last match,6
I think the best match to look forward to now is DC v MI.,2
The only gripe I have this match is wasting Stoinis completely as a Batsman and a backup bowler.,4
"commentator: keeps strike for the next over, 

takes single first ball next over

commentator: pikachu face",15
We had some great fucking games this year then csk happened,-2
RRR crosses 30. Dhoni's trap card has been activated,2
[deleted],11
Give last over to Dhawan to bring home the fact that we care about 2 points rather than NRR.,13
They lost the match when they were 44/3 after 9 overs. That was pretty fucking moronic.,19
CSK just need to hit 6s in the remaining balls. No biggie,9
"Well, they're showing intent. I suppose that's better than before",4
CSK is officially the most boring team in this IPL?,9
"“THERE IS NO PASSION, THERE IS NO VISION, THERE IS NO FUCKING AGGRESSION IN THIS CRICKET CLUB”

Dhoni probably idk",3
Dhoni and co. are such an uninspiring team.,2
Lmao no wonder Pant and Shrey couldn't get going,3
Today they dont even have the run rate excuse.,7
"If they didn't  drop Vijay and Jadhav next match 
, Csk shouldn't be allowed to play.",1
Is it time to give up already?,2
Thala almost killed jadeja with that shot,2
"When is the next match at Sharjah, wanna see some T20 after watching this test batting by CSK?",5
I will through my phone and break my tv i swear to fucking god,6
Great bowling selections brilliant captaincy....... Dhoni,6
"Intent is lost boys, csk will not make top 4 mark my words",8
"Yes..give it to jadeja and then fans will blame him for eating up balls, whereas Ive scored 2 sixes, who's gonna blame me?",4
Yess thala 53 of 10. 2-3 quick singles and then start hitting,4
Whatever happened between Raina and CSK Mgmt will be resolved very soon.,7
"Gotta like how Iyer goes about his captaincy, among the more composed captains",3
9 sixes off 9,2
"Man, watching dhoni play is so depressing.",2
Is Roar Macha really DC slogan?,3
"Finish them, Agent 3310.",1
Need only 9 sixes now. Easy,1
MS Dhoni the chase master playing after 438 days or something will easily take CSK over finishing line : Jatin Sapru probably,3
"I'm not the biggest CSK fan, and even I feel humiliated",4
6*9=54 dhoni gon smash all for 6,1
can sreyas iyer have 2 slips next over,1
Man I feel guilty shitposting on CSK's batting after yesterday,4
"2020 is here to jinx 
CSK not reaching play-offs and RCB winning it all?",4
DC’s bowling has been too class and CSK’s batting third class.,4
Bet on 2+ sixes from dhoni in last over,6
Seriously what the fuck is wrong with dhoni,1
"CSK going to play all matches for saving NRR . 

Pains to see as CSK fan. I guess 2020 is a wash .",4
Dhoni 200 strike rate in last 2 overs shit stat again,3
Kaif can't stop smiling lmaoo,2
Over 6 a ball required. It's time for Dhoni to start hitting 6s,3
"Great shot ms , nice 1",2
this is sad at this point,3
a 6 every ball pretty much,2
Indian media gonna go nuts after this game lol,1
"Other than few errors, DC field placements were good",3
"That seals it. CSK is weird. 
2019: Takes it deep for win.
2020: Takes it deep for NRR.",4
Send Curran opening if he plays 15  balls he'll score 40 instead of fucking 10.,5
I wanna hear what Dhoni has to say about this one.,2
I am happy for Delhi's revival in ipl I hope they get into playoffs.,2
CSK are playing like they're on strike or something.,2
Mathematically they cant win any more,2
Oof,2
"It's physically painful to see Dhoni struggling like this. At this point, not us, he is just trolling himself.",2
One more dot ball and RRR will be >36 then thala will show you who's the boss,4
CSK have officially lost. Shocking.,1
Who was that fat and grumpy ashwin,1
Who should bowl last over? Save Rabada,3
"The first captain who will admit and say at the toss, ""we will have a bat first thanks"" will be my man for the entire tournament",6
So 9 sixes to get from  9 balls....,1
This chase is more hopeless than me in exams,3
"Match is lost. Time to deny singles, change bats and hit 4 sixes.",7
I guess they're realizing how important Raina was. He's one of the few players in CSK who actually went above the RRR usually.,7
"Just realised this CSK needs the slow low fucked grounds of Chepauk to win matches.

That has been taken away, the reason they look so abysmal.",3
Worried for rabadas stats when dhoni hits him for 4 sixes in the last over with 45 required off 6,2
Very disappointing match even as a non CSK fan lmao. They really need to gear up,0
"Required run-rate above 36, can expect those big sixes from Dhoni now 😍",8
The RR is 6.64. I have got that going for me.,0
Really frustrating performance. Guess this was eventually bound to happen with this team full of dinosaurs,2
DC probably batted om different pitch.,3
Guess who's going to change his flair now,6
In b4 3 dhoni sixes since the target is officially out of reach,1
This is embarrassing,3
Dhoni will hit atleast 2 sixes in the last over,8
"the way everyone started praising CSK for their comebacks out of nowhere in the 1st game, and everyone losing hope trashing everything about CSK rn lmao",5
Even RCB is getting hopeful against CSK after this performance.,9
I do not know why CSK fanboys are not up in arms seeing this crap,5
Painful to watch,4
Dhoni is working really hard to taint his hard-earned legacy.,7
"ah yes RR > 36, just the way Daddy Dhoni likes it",14
Dhoni playing dots in 19th 😭😂,5
CSK is what a cricket team coached by Jose Mourinho would look like.,2
"Atleast Dhoni is trying today, just not succeeding in hitting enough boundaries.",10
[deleted],7
"Okay lads, run rate over 36, we should witness thala sixes anytime now",10
"As a Delhi fan, its hard to express the feeling when your team wins with an over to spare.",11
The game is gone. Time for fireworks.,2
"Surely, DC should atleast make the Knockouts based on the way they have played.",3
"Lol! Like every year, RCB starts with the worst run rate of all teams.",3
Now Dhoni time guys,2
Book a suite room and bring back Raina,8
So wrong of dhoni to just get 34 runs off the first 6 overs.,-2
"Sam curran getting demoted

For batting against the policy of NRR in last 2 games",13
At what point does it become funny?,2
Can they go for review against wide?,2
Vijay and Watson should take responsibility for this loss.,1
Even umesh yadav bowling and russel batting can't win this now,12
What a find Nokia has been,7
What a boring chase this has been. CSK were never in the game.,1
I am now thinking Delhi might have the upper hand.,3
Its ridiculous how the commentators are still excited about Dhoni being on strike.,8
6 helicopters in the last over.. Come on thala,0
Officially supporting DC after 11 PM,4
How brilliant has Nortje been today?,3
Pant when he is confident is keeping really well,2
Hopefully 3 more sixes and a notout for Thala again,2
Csks batting too weak. When will people like vijay gaikwad jadhav actually perform,2
Dhoni has successfully taken the game deeper than a 36RR,7
Nokia is pretty good damn. Hidden gem.,3
Stat padding resumes in 3..2..,7
"Csk making our victory over them look shitty, Dhoni bro loose to them with 15 runs only.",3
Yeah it looks like CSK might need NRR in the later matches if they play like this so thala vindicated,4
"Why did Dhobi come to bat anyway?

Just give some batting practice for Chahar and Chawla.",6
Come on Dhoni. You can do it.,3
Nokia mocking CSK by giving wides.,5
I think we should open with faf/watson. Vijay is not working out. Gaikwad maybe. Vijay is just too slow. Puts pressure on watson and eventually the entire team.,5
The chase was fked up but at least don't deny us the last over Dheiner Sixes™,2
52 more wides????????,7
Csk not able to fill the void Raina left in the batting order it looks in complete disarray,5
"If I were Dhenier, I'd be in pavilion hooked to MakeMyTrip Dubai~Ranchi flights",6
I don't see Carey coming in squad real soon,6
No words can describe the happiness of DC fans. 15-7,9
Lmao Nortje desperate to give CSK a chance with all these extras,9
Three sixes incoming or is it too soon.,4
Fucking take notes RCB,1
How tf is that wide!,1
Why is that wide,0
Wholesome to see Ricky and Kaif bond while Dahiya lurks in the background,10
When will bravo come back?,3
Nokia just finish your over mate,7
When is the CSK vs RCB match? At least that's always entertaining and might get CSK back in its mojo.,23
"5 runs in 19th over .
Commentators - kYa SiNglE LiYa hAi",23
Guys Dhoni noticed that Delhi has a very strong team. He is giving them this win so that they become over confident. Its all part of his master plan,25
Time to change the bat for MSD,22
Nokia disconnecting Opponents,19
Bhosdike when the RRR is greater than 36 why not just bowl wicket to wicket instead of all this fancy stuff,4
I would rather open with Curran instead of Vijay.,3
Last two matches have been very boring,2
"for someone who started watching cricket in 2003, seeing kaifu and punter be best pals at the dug out is very disorienting.",14
I think delhi might win this one,9
yeah this is painful but funny,7
"Now that the target is beyond their reach, how many sixes can we expect from Dhoni in the last over?",7
Nortje 50 straight wides,11
"DC should not let them go easy in last over, good time to bump the NRR",3
"Ponting: Dilli se hoon

Kaif: I am Kaif",8
"Would be interesting to see how CSK does from now. Every year they keep winning while having 1 or 2 dead weight players who comes off good in one of the crunch matches and that is hailed as genius of team management. While being good, this is easy to pull off when you are winning. And that's the reason why you see RCB or DC(not last year) making so many changes. Like to see for how long CSK can keep this facade going.",8
Death bowling masterclass from Nokia,8
This has been a terrible chase. Atleast RCB are entertaining while losing,11
"I do like Kaif, even for cricbuzz commentary, he shows up prepared.",2
Delhi just need to get Mark Wood as Rabada / Nortje replacement backup next season. And a good Indian quick in place for Mohit / Avesh and they have all bases covered.,3
[deleted],4
"i mean..game was almost gone by the time msd arrived. but let's be honest, he could have done fuckall vs rabada & nortje",6
Lmao imagine saving the NRR against a 200+ chase while getting cucked in a 170 chase,7
Here comes the HUGE OVER,1
Only Ngidi can save the chase now,4
6 runs of 19th over out of which 2 were extras.,7
Jaddu farming the strike.,2
Kinda sad to see CSK lose like this.,3
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/izi98o/match_thread_7th_match_chennai_super_kings_v/g6jv5x2/

So happy to be proven wrong. :D",3
P a d t h e s t a t s,7
Finally dhoni can start playing his actual knock now,7
I am so damn happy with DC. Always been a DD/DC fan.,7
Even the worst captain in the world would send Curran over Jadeja lmao,6
10 sixes in one over By THALA ^intent,7
Dhoni boom boom time go for the win csk!!!,1
"I still wanna know. 
Why would you send kedar jadhav at that point in the game",5
They should have let Sam Curran come in early. Atleast one player who is playing to win other than Faf,7
Inb4 Dhoni hits 2 sixes in the last over,0
Imagine blaming MS for this xD,2
Why does Kaif's face look like Delhi have lost this,1
"They are still playing dots lol, is pitch getting worse, I mean DC didn't do well in second half of their innings",2
These are the testing times we as csk fans have to go as i think.,6
"Barring Avesh, what a wonderful team effort with the bowl. Everyone chipped in. Every fucking one.
GG",3
It's sixes time!,-1
Still gettable if Rabada bowls a bunch of 5 wides and no balls and Dhoni can hit a bunch of sixes. Ez win then /s,3
Just got an ad for MS Dhoni the untold story. 😢,4
"Next match of CSK vs SRH
Thala Dhoni bashes bowlers like Kaul and Sandeep smh",2
Well I dont think dhoni did anything wrong today he should've come early there's that other than that idt this loss is on him,3
"Man, we wouldn't have been here if Srini mama just gave Raina his fucking balcony x(",5
[deleted],2
The worst part about this as fan is they didn't even try. CSK is just trash.,-1
Jadeja proving that he's just shit as a t20 batsman.,-1
Last 3 matches have been really disappointing to watch because of the shitty chases. Maybe teams winning the toss should start batting first.,3
[deleted],5
I cant watch,5
Unzip time bois,3
End this misery,2
How many sixes in this over?,0
What abt Quantum of Loss bois... /s,2
Last over thala special incoming?,-3
Ennada panni vechu irukkeenga. Hope CSK comes back strong in the rest of the matches.,4
DC bowling is seriously impressive. Especially if Ishant comes back,6
left a lot to do in last over,1
Dhoni will get few balls to stat pad which will give Jatin Sapru chance to talk about him instead of winning team,4
"6 a ball lads, not per over",5
Any chances of raina coming back?,1
time for some dhoni sixers.,1
Delhi is still missing Ishant Sharma & R Ashwin btw.,10
You fools its all about Net run rate who cares about the 2 points.,8
I finally understand why dhoni didn't bat higher up the order in the first game,3
Want dhoni to hit 3 sixes of Rabada just to rub salt on ESPNcricinfo office 😭😂,2
Nest two matches are meh. RCB v MI on Monday.,0
Especially mad that they ruined potential fantasy points by not sending Sam,6
Dew factor seems overstated the batsmen in the second innings are struggling,9
5.0 >!x 10^1!< runs per over,6
"CSK worst team this season? Idk kkr, rcb, srh aren't far behind but with csk it feels like they are themeselves trying to kill their chances.",2
Jadeja is the Chahal of CSK at this point,1
"Lmao CSK fans lose their shit after losing one game

Welcome to da club guys",10
Rabada double hat trick,1
Haha dhoni trolling r/cricket by not taking strike,3
Thank god we dont have to see this shit for another week.,3
Dhoni taking 2s because even NRR doesn't matter lmao,5
Kingfisher's O Laa la leo >>>>>> Jio Dhan Dhanna Dhan,6
How much NRR CSK need to lose by to top the table?,4
Dhoni circlejerk on commentary is just at all time high. Talking about 3 sixes in last over against RR but not the dots.,9
"Why not playing Sam after 2nd wicket when it's needed?
Why Rituraj and Kedar?",1
Ab gaand me bhar lo NRR bhenchod,10
"Atleast in the last match we knew why they were doing what they were doing, this is just mind boggling.

They're not even FUCKING TRYING.",8
Reverse the batting order next match. Im serious. Chahar Chawla to open,6
"Lol Dhawan, straight out of EA Cricket 2007",2
Nice running between the wickets,1
"Moral of the day:-

Doing fuckall in the first 10 and expecting a miracle in last 10 is a very very very bad idea",12
Thalas master plan to win the IPL is to ....... Come at 7 and take it deeper than Donald Trump and his 4d chess ?,3
Bc if Curran had been sent in earlier he could have hit a couple sixes and scored me some points on dreamXI,7
Sixes incoming,2
"Wtf are these two doing, either swing or get out.",3
What's with Dhavan's glasses !!,2
4 sixes coming up,3
This match is definition of not being able to get it off the square,3
"Hey, MSD, you know what's more important than NRR? Points",3
CSK are the Juventus of cricket,2
What is this playing for NRR nonsense. You need points first.,3

Faf watto Rayudu dhoni Curran jaddu this should be order,4
"Now that match is lost, hattrick of sixes from Dhoni incoming",2
Ridiculous,1
csk on their march towards run rate neutrality by 2030,2
No fireworks today because Rabada.,2
Ok... I thought people were kidding... Shikhar DUANE has the worst glasses on right now... what was he thinking?,1
Why do they have a 1-2 seating arrangement in the Dugout ?,1
Raina saved himself from his embarassing team,2
How did Mumbai lose to this team,0
Like whats the point in sending Gaikwad and Kedar before Sam in a 10+ RPO chase,3
What a fantastic team of senior citizens we have. We are totally not making the playoffs this time.,2
Meme,0
Boom bhakts he is gone,5
Atleast RCB collapse spectacularly.,8
Disgrace that Curran didn't get to bat. He could have come in the middle overs and smashed a 30(10),5
"1 six this entire innings, what a joke",3
Lol.. no consolation Sixes today..,3
And Dhoni gone.,2
KG 1 - THALA 0,2
Here comes the Mahi 6666,0
Does CSK even wanna win or are these uncles just playing to showcase how shit they are,6
Lulz.,1
Today's the day Jadeja fucked up the match against Afghanistan 2 years ago in the Asia Cup in this part of the world.Still can't get over it 😤,5
Oh no .. No thala special for today,2
They do have to try and save the nnr tho,3
Damn he’s not even hitting during the last over.,4
It'll be funny if CSK keep losing matches and then Dhoni comes higher and higher up the order and ends up opening,7
Losing by what margin would CSK considerate it as a good loss?,7
"Hahahahahahahahahahahaha. Rabada and 2 wickets every game, name a better duo.",2
MI somehow lost to this team. They really start horribly don’t they,15
"Respect to Dhoni for walking, I'll give that",12
Pant is a fat boy,4

Smh can't even hit sixes when it doesn't matter now smh my head,2
"CSK are playing like backbenchers, trying for pass mark",2
Kill me,4
"Calm down guys, Thala was just thinking about the NRR.",4
Jadeja with the 150 SR.... top notch SR that for T20s....,1
Is Dhoni fucking dead inside?,12
I guess CSK this season is there to motivate other teams.,4
Man Pant is fat as fuck,1
Aaaaand he's gone.,1
"Why are they making Rabada bowl, heartless.",8
"Just a thought, maybe avesh bowling earlier was a rise by iyer to call out Dhoni. He was likely to be cleaned in last over. Maybe iyer just cut down a Dhoni excuse.",2
jadeja fist pumping rabada lol,5
"Thala dhoni, avg gone down :(",9
Oh no. Sad NRR noises,6
What a pathetic run chase,8
MS 'Doh!'-ni,4
Rather have them hit and get out than farm the strike.,3
O la lalala leeeooo,2
Come out early and give yourself some time dhoni. Number 4 is made for you. You are better than jadhav at number 4.,5
Poor Dhenier didn’t realise it was Rabada and not Umesh/Avesh,3
CSK will be screwed if there isn't a mega auction this year.,3

Dhoni did not even hit a six today for fans to jerk off too. Saving NRR my ass,9

Great catch by Pant,5
Atleast RCB batsmen tried to win /s,4
Sam Curran coming like how stoinis came last 3 balls,5
Dhoni is awesome. He took it to the last over. Now it's him vs the bowler. It depends on who loses their cool first. The bowler is going to pee his pants at the sight of the great MSD and bowl 10 overs of no balls.,11
"I'll rate this CSK performance ""Shitshow"".",11
Good catch by Pant,4
"Lol, so much for the attempted stat padding",6
"Dhoni : Time for customary sixes

Rabada: Hold my short ball Dhenier",13

No. Where is the NRR fixer MSD ? NRR gonna kill the CSK team now,5
Man I feel bad for Dhoni. It must be hard to be him right now.,2
"Notmydhoni

Not out is missing.",2
Looks like Thala had an epiphany and will announce it tonight,3
15 off 12. Includes Avesh Khan's bowling.,4
GuRu kA cAtCh pAkDa cHeLe nE fuck off m8 just blow him already,4
Jadeja-Rabada fist bumping. Fixing confirmed?,2
Cricbuzz should start its post match show the match is done here,6
I think this time CSK will struggle hard to reach the playoffs.. Maybe end up at 5th..,3
"RRR 69, nice",1
"I think csk is fucked this season.

They don't have enough back up to replace the dead weights in the team.

And Dhoni can only tonk the weak links. Umesh, Tom Curran. You can't win a match by hitting 1 bowler",9
This inning was just boring? Hard to care when they're not giving a shit about winning.,1
Doesn’t even wait to see if the catch was clean or not. Says a lot,1
When RCB collapses at least it's entertaining to watch. This is just boring and depressing,7
THAT DEFENSE,2
Lol post match thread already posted! Let's goooooo,4
Sam Curran in when the asking rate is impossible?,6
NICE SOLID DEFENCE CURRAN,2
wasnt csk the first team to start training for the IPL?,2
Consider me retired. MSD at the end of IPL,6
"Sunny paaji says for Dhoni wicket- A big one. I mean really! , at this stage of the match, meanwhile Hindi commentators be like ""kya catch diya hai Dhoni ne, lajawab !",5
"Match = lost

NRR  = **S  A  V  E  D**",4
Dhawan forgot to remove his glasses straight after skydiving onto the ground for the match.,6
I'd take yesterday chase any day,1
Textbook defense from School Boy,3
Waiting for Ms to come out and feed the fans some bullshit about something.,5
Sam Curran plsyin defense in 19.3,3
Lol. Curran defending,4
[deleted],6
I laughed when curran defended.,6
I just wanna die now.,3
Curran coming in with three balls to go is ridiculous,6
Probably a reason why teams are bad chasing this year is that they aren't playing at the Chinnyswamy RCB stadium,4
Can’t wait for Rayudu to return,3
Ah! Dhoni fans would have loved him getting some boundaries in that last over so they can conveniently point failures of others.,7
CSK are trolling us all this season. You thought Dhoni slows it down too much? Let's see what you have to say about our go slow strategy from top down,5
Lmao why the fuck was jadeja giving rabada a fist bump,9
Khelo dimag se,7
this will probably be dhenier's last ipl,4
Did Curran just..? You know what. It’s been that kind of game anyways,2
Fixing behnchod   /s,3
"CSK gained literally nothing from this match, I wonder what thala fanzz have to say now?",3

Poda Dhoni mandaya. Hope Rayudu comes back soon. He's CSK's only hope. Vijay is useless. Who's this Gaikwad.,-3
Whole team played like shit,3
What do CSK fans think of this version of Dhoni? Do you believe the team is better with him or would be improved without him?,2
Pant has been good behind the wickets today.,3
Ranada be like : Quantum of loss my foot.,3
"Panty took the catch and didn't even claim it
Thalla 😒",1
"Really puts Pants unnings in perspective, pitch got slower",5
"I'm pretty sure CSK didn't try to save NRR last game either, they were clueless and it just happened to look like that.",9
When was the last time CSK was beaten like this,1
Big F,1
[deleted],19
Vijay should never open the innings for csk ever again. The guys done. Not the same player he was back in the day. Until rayudu comes the top order is going to heavily rely on faf to stick around till the end. Csk in desperate need for a change in the batting order. Sam curran should be sent up to either open or come at 3/4 until rayudu is back. This experimenting with vijay and gaikwad has to stop.,10
[deleted],0
Who makes the decision about the batting order is it Dhoni or Fleming?,1
Inb4 CSK pick Yusuf Pathan as replacement for Raydu,3
Kya fayda hua nrr bacha kar jab agle match me aur ganda hugna tha,1
Rude Reality check to dhoni today,5
Everyone thats blaming Dhoni for this needs to look at the shitshow from Vijay and watto at the top,3
Lmao they are not even swinging the bat now,1
You know this match isn't fixed cos it would be too obvious. CSK team is well past its sell by date. Retire the entire team and start fresh next year with Dhoni as mentor,10
Damn. They literally choked the CSK. Well done Delhi Bois.,12
Fucking shit team man. Old man stuff is actually been against us now,6
Ok so what is Curran doing,13
Curran trolling csk right now,8
Poor Sam,1
I've figured it out. CSK are going for the fair play award by letting their opponents win,13
next match dhoni to come 3 down,8
"15 of 12 means he can score 500 if there are 400 balls.

  


Look at all that potential in THELLA.",16
Do you think bravo will play this ipl?,3
I don't even feel like shitposting for this CSK team anymore.,13
"Quantam of loss only 44 now

Textbook",2
Gg,4
"Sam curran punished for playing shots last match

Sam like an obdient student defends the first ball this time",24
"Fuck you, csk",5
Nice test match,6
"So disappointing, Dhoni didn't hit 10 sixes in 10 balls.",3
Final nail in coffin,4
Fuck yeah,3
Mishra ji is cute. Period.,12
Even if Raina had been there I don’t think it would have made any difference.,9
Shreyas Iyer captaincy masterclass,8
Thank you Jaddu for making Rabada's stats better..,14
wtaf was this chase,3
Thank God we won,3
So it was Rabada who was stat padding,9
What type of sunglasses is Dhawan wearing lol,5
[removed],2
Now I am so happy,2
[Really overestimated CSK batting 😅](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/izi98o/-/g6jkk3r),3
"He didn’t even call for his other bat today, really had given up on NRR as well",11
131/7 from 20 overs. Pathetic,6
MSD wants to take it deep every time. But at this age - it is not a matter of size. it is no of times you can make it rise.,32
Dhoni should continue batting at 7. He has my support,16
So the difference between last match and this match for CSK is the three sixes?,3
HUM JEET GAYE BHENCHOD,3
Hopefully the NRR koolaid salesmen take a hike after this match. NRR is relevant when table gets crowded in second half.,7
40 runs is huge margin for a loss/victory in a T20.,8
Rabada purple cap?,4
CSK didn't even play for NRR today,7
Omg rabada pinching Mishra's cheeks,3
CSK fans - Start a change.org petition to Raina asap,4
Jadeja has got to be trolling CSK these past 2 matches!,5
To be fair they have lost 2 of their best batsman,0
Stoinis had a nice day out,5
Gg. Garbage match. RR was way better than this shit. CSK are ded this year.,4
[deleted],3
One of the biggest Strength of Rabada is that he has common sense.,3
4 run 20th over. You don't see many of those.,3
KL Rahul >CSK,18
Curran blocking first ball reminds me of that batsman in gully cricket who used to be pissed off for being sent too late to bat.,26
"Dhoni is on more screen time in his ads of Khatttabook, Mutual Funds, TVS etc than he's batting in middle.  Are we indians cricket lovers or cricketers dick suckers? Somthing to think about. Goodnight Shubhratri 😊",15
Scurran defending his first ball to assert his dominance on all the NRR worriers,12
Curran CSK training complete.,16
CSK should play in a white jersey because it signifies 1)test batting and 2) surrender,24
Rayadu is our most important player. We need him back,7
Appreciation post for Axar Patel. Gets his job done quitely.,25
Csk was utter shite but delhi needs to work on its fielding.,8
What an absolute shitshow from CSK!,6
The tamil commentary is absolutely brutal. Atleast they are calling out this sorry excuse for cricket we saw last two matches,9
Lol did Rabada just pinch Mishra jis cheek?,9
We won Bhenchod,7
I thought KKR's innings against MI was bad. But then we saw RCB & CSK's innings in two consecutive matches.,6
I have no words for csk honestly.,1
Team lost AND no feel-good sixes,1
"**19.6** Rabada to Jadeja, OUT, that's that. One more for Rabada. Three wickets at the death. Jadeja just gives catching pressure to Mishra at point **131-7**

RA Jadeja c Mishra b Rabada 12 (9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33",1
There is really something going on behind the scenes in the CSK camp. No intention to win let alone play. Disastrous.,9
hahaha fuck me,5
Yay,0
"Yes I happy we defeated Mumbai already.

We are lucky with reaching two finals.


I am not crying.",6
I'm off to sleep. I actually hope tomorrow's match is at least entertaining.,0
Safe to say I guess that history will be made this time as CSK has a very good chance of not making it to the playoffs.,5
That's gonna put a dent in the old NRR,2
Bro screw UAE stadiums. Run chases are not fun at all. Pitch is dead after the first innings.,-7
Delhi have an absolutely amazing team this season,3
This is the year of the north.,1
"Thank god Dhoni retired from International Cricket.


Pathetic.",4
"So pathetic today, didn't even try. From the start itself, just downright pathetic.",5
"😍 Top notch win, top of the table. Hope we keep this momentum going.",9
"All players should build good portfolio this season, big auction this year",3

Quantum of Win^TM Philosophy from Rabada,3
"Don't let the nRR distract you from the fact that Hetmeyer is shit at catching, even worse than brokholi.",14
Gg DC. You guys outclassed us. Lol how did we even defeat Mumbai 🤣🤣🤣,9
I will fucking kill anyone who chooses bowling after winning toss,9
What is it about people and overreacting literally every single time we lose? Like calm tf down,6
The final turd in the shitfest,5
"this do be epic scenes, DC did real well gg",2
"Gays, dhoni got out because tomorrow is Saturday and on Saturday morning you pray early. Keep calm guys!! He will pray and come back stronger Support dhoni.",11
Ah! Thank God it's over.,4
How did CSK beat us,25

Only 1 six the whole innings by csk,6
"Curran smart boy, didn't let himself get out....",3

Rabada farming wickets against tail-enders smh,11
Dhoni btw is in almost every advertisement. Even for matrimonial app.,11
"I really hope CSK gets rid of this Dhoni shit hole, bought all those guys past their prime into the side,like some sort of Charity. Watson, Vijay, Du Plesis, Jadhav, Dhoni himself and Jadeja are well past their prime in this format. The way they bat is embarrassing to say the least",5

"You know what you just watched boys, you just watched a match that hasn't been fixed or scripted one little bit!",6
nice tottywatch by the cameraman,1
Imagine dhoni having a breakdown in post match n retiring ipl midway like Gambhir,4
Dhoni must scrutinize everyone on the team except faf and Curran they were the only good things to come out of this match also Hazlewood.,7
Surely now toss winners won’t choose to field first anymore,3
DC - King of the North!!,1
One of the reasons I like Shawn Michaels is because he retired at the right time. People like Undertaker and Dhoni just don't know when to hang their boots. They end up becoming memes,9
"You should not bowl full to Dhoni during the last over. he will easily hit it for a six.

Is Rabada the only IPL bowler with some common sense?",26
Dhoni putting pressure on the CSK openers for the next game...,4
"CSK should drop Watson, open with Rayudu

Play Sam Curran at 3",3

"Why not playing Sam after 2nd wkt when needed?
Why Kedar and Rituraj ?",2
"Delhi's fielding was horrendous and they still won comfortably, that shows csk's performance.",5
"How is it that both dhoni haters and lovers have such a hard on for him.

He is just 1 player and batting wise todays loss is definitely not his fault..

It was long over before he came in.. The teams winning matches are those whose top order batters are carrying them..the funda is simple..ur top 3 must fire to win..

Just stop obsessing about MS so much..God..",14
NRR went from -0.145 to -0.840,17
Seeing DC win is such a wholesome feeling. I see them like the kids in my block.,27
CSK will think about improving their NRR in the playoffs also lol,30

This is like beating Gully ke uncles 🥱,12
"Will CSK,MI end up at the bottom of the point table ever ?",4
Imagine if captains still choose to field after winning the toss,20
By this rate dhoni will have to retire from IPL like gambhir .,10
Godzilla had a heart attack trying to understand this chase,15
Let's be honest the game was done and dusted when CSK scored just 47 of first 10 overs..,14

Why Kedar and Rituraj's shitshow?",5

Don't CSK deserve some kind of senior citizen discount on the opposition's total? Whatever happened to respecting your elders?,56
Shaw or Rabada for MotM?,2
CSK is useless without their minefield Chennai pitch.,15
"While I am not a Dhoni fan, you can't really blame Dhoni for today. Other than coming in too late or sending Curran too late.",4
"Everyone was shit except Faf , Sam & Hazlewood",15
Balaji roasting Csk lol.,14
I can't even express how underrated Mishra ji is. DC has very good bowling line-up.,18
Dhoni's batting has changed from being the embodiment of procrastination to the embodiment of depression,21
2 wins in a row nice,10
CSK getting exposed without their free 6 wins every season on Chepauk dustbowls where no team except MI can beat them.,21
Only watto any idea of chasing this.,4

At least Dhoni got to give Faf the orange cap.,12
This is only the third time ever that CSK have lost two of their opening three matches in an IPL season. The other two occasions were in 2009 and 2012.,8

Csk need a trading window like epl to get some top order players from others.,10

There is only so much Dhoni can do when the opening batsmen perform like that,27
Boring chase.,6
I am the biggest critic of Dhoni but he is always class in interviews. Never gives an excuse or blames anyone.,27
"How can you hate MS
Man always cracks me up",37
"Dhoni, charming mofo as ever.",43
Shane watson needs to fix his stroke making.It seems that he gets out playing the pull shot 8 or 9 times out of 10.,8
"""Don't blame Dhoni, the match was over by the time he walked out to bat.""

Ummm okay, if only he had the power to send himself up the order ahead of Jadhav, who has a SR under 100 in his last 16 IPL matches.",36
"Curran should open, kxip tried once",18
"Every year CSK loses matches but not in this manner consecutively .
Even with the 200 runs on board last match , both these matches felt like absolute submission and no fight at all from them makes it more disheartening.
Only good thing for them is they have one week time recover and regroup before their next game.",29
"Rabada has beautiful eyes 


No homo",31
Did he just say “it wasnt too jew-y?,5
"I love dhoni no matter what.

But i fucking hate csk bhakts.",43

KG is golden,10
"Vijay, Ruturaj and Jadhav would be replaced in any other team, but not CSK ""back the players""",21
Rabada is such a cutie 😍😍😍,12
"Say what you want about Dhoni's declining batting form, but the man's attitude after losing is something to behold. He treats cricket just as it should be; a game where one sides wins and one sides loses, and not a religion or life and death.",29
"Haha wait - Rabada overtook Sam for the cap with that last wicket of Jadeja.

Is that why Sam defended the first ball to him, to try to make sure he retained the cap?",39
rabada is so cuteeeee,26
"If I remember correctly ,DC have had similar starts to 20  19 or 18 season as well ,but they have lacked consistency later on .",-10

"What is Nokia's first name ?

"They really don't have any hitter in their lineup do They? The problem isnt just his batting order. The Whole of batting order is incapable. Spinners can't do much outside chennai and fast bowlers have never really been their speciality. Next match, kick vijay out seriously. Can't do much with the batting, promote dhoni to 4 and fuck everyone else coz they are shit anyway.",29
Is UltraEdge 100% accurate? Seems pretty strange no one picked that edge!,7
Rayudu coming back next game atleast gives some relief to cskians,26

"Meta: instead of blaming Kohli’s captaincy whenever RCB loses and Dhoni’s batting approach when CSK loses, how about blaming the entire team for their losses? It’s a team game for a fucking reason.",15
[lmaoo](https://i.imgur.com/RdCBORI.jpg),10
CSK needs to drop a young one and bring in Imran Tahir. The average age is too low!.  The opponents are not showing them the respect they demand!,35
Can't help but think about Cricket 07 whenever i hear Mark Nicholas,38
Irony is the net run rate specialists loosing with similar  margin as us blind swingers(name given by msdian),26
Watson stonksss,3
"Shreyas I forgive you, the boundaries were too long",35
CSK won't make playoffs this year. This performance was pathetic.,28
So that explains koachs catch drops lol,15
Not a big fan of Gambhir but that dude knew when his time was up and made way for others. Dhoni is better off as a mentor or something. His playing days are long gone.,40
"What a day to be a loyal Delhi fan, knowing this illusion might not last forever",43
Yes definitely Iyer,2

With what hope wud fans watch next csk match",24

Msd why slow 😭,3
what a smile Rabada has,23
"With How much Dhonis was complaining for wide ball today and how he argued with the Umpire last game, how is CSK on top of the fair play?",50
"CSK batting is pathetic. All yesteryear superstars and some Indian mid-age uncle club. Watto looks like he's about to hang his shoes. Faf can't accelerate. Vijay, Jadhav and Dhoni can only add 50 runs max together at a run a ball maybe even less. Any total above 170-180 and they basically give up. You can call it 'taking it deep' but that shit literally fails 95% of the times nowadays with Dhoni.",38
"Gotta give some credit to Axar Patel, it surprises me, but he's been bowling pretty well. 4.00 Economy is amazing.",31
Delhi has a team for now and the future. Some brilliant young players.,16
"so what is the deal with the dew? people could barely hold on to the ball a few days ago, and today there was no dew? how does that work in uae?",3
Can we play this meme team everyday? Thanks!,10
Delhi winning this makes me think Madara won. This is Infinite Tsukuyomi. Pls let them win the final.,14
DC is the official father of CSK.,10
CSK is a representation of Dhoni: a team/player that is dead for long but we are holding onto their spirit.,22
I honestly think Delhi fucked up big time in their batting by not getting to 200 (or say not even trying). But the bowling made up for it.,20
The dhoni dick sucking has begun!,28
Master tactician my arse!,20
I say we just drop people who drop catches. We have a strong enough team but the drops really need to go.,15
Who is the current purple cap holder?,11
"two match in a row Pant has played useful, sensible innings of great value",21
"Shreyas, just lift the trophy this year dude. It's been more than a decade for us now.",25
"Dhenier: ""I don't think it was a good game for us"". How did you reach that deduction, genius!?",24
"Worst thing is that Commentators and Star sports were orgasming Over Dhoni. It looked pretty difficult even when Faf was standing.


 They started showing stats of Dhoni when it was like 80 runs from 30 balls. 




And then Dhoni comes and pulls out another 2020 Dhoni. Emphasis on 2020 cuz in 2019, he was fire and actually finished games. This time CSK has to do some major self improvement or they're not qualifiying. 







Really happy for Delhi tho.",45
CSK bowling this year is being very expensive. Also what happened to Rayudu? Haven’t seen him at all after that MI match and is Tahir playing this year ?,15
"I wouldn’t rule out CSK for Playoffs just yet 
The team may not look comparatively strong but if they sort out certain issues they can get back on track.
Btw do they have any replacement opener instead Murali Vijay or Watson?
Hadn’t faf opened for them in some previous season",11
They should replace gaikwad with rayadu or raina,1
You would think there is some kind of protest from CSK going by how they plan their innings lol.,8
"I feel Jadeja as batsman is underused by CSK , they can drop one batsman in the middle order and make Jadeja play there and add extra bowler to strengthen their bowling attack. Also when Rayudu is back they can leave out Vijay and promote Faf as opener alongside Watson",7
Lol he fanboying over Lara with the rest of us,2
What was that camera work,3
