Let's go,0
Any news on Iyer and Pant's availability?,1
Iyer is heavily needed he plays spin really well and they're gonna go with atleast 3.,1
"If we have all of pant, hetmyer and iyer we should win easy",4
"It feels like Chahar is getting hit a lot. But he has the lowest econ out of our bowlers. He's just not giving us the early break throughs.

This would be a great fucking time to turn that around.",11
Dads gonna bitch slap these punk dc kids today.,3
"I'd just be happy for a game with no more injuries at this point, nevermind the result.",1
"Cool, Iyer has been confirmed to play, that's right!!",2
Should I be hopeful or not,3
"Ok so we chase for the second time , should be a good test.",1
"Who would have thought we would see Delhi vs Chennai with DC being the clear favourites who are extremely likely to qualify, and CSK being the struggling team having to make changes and wondering if they’ll make the top 4.",6
Ok.. Kedar Jadhav is back!!!,8
Jadhav is in the 11,7
Pant will be back next game so that's extremely good we will be full strength then,3
Jagadeesan : Am I a joke to you?,62
CSK is too batting heavy again with Kedar in the squad (unless he's going to bowl as well),4
Jadhav is back yeah no playoffs for us this time.,10
"Kedar again for ffs. 

Giving chances again to that degenerate performance instead of a decently performing youngster. 

That's THALA's 5D chess for you.",44
What a fuckn great game.,5
Bring Jadhav in is so unfair. Jagadeesan did nothing wrong. Don't know what CSK management is seeing in Jadhav that we are failing to see.,14
What kind of weird photos or videos of Dhoni does Kedar have that he's being picked ?,3
DC to CSK : The future is now old man,5
"Calling it now
Jadav to open with Curran",2
Jadhav must give the best blowjobs,4
What a great game. Man Ab is a t20 legend,3
Jadhav's back. CSK's team selection is a massive joke.,6
Will CSK pass the reflex test conducted by DC pacers?,2
The return of Kedar Jadhav.,5
Thank fuck we don't have an Unadkat in our team,17
Dunno what Dhoni is trying to prove. I mean it doesn’t hurt to give Jagadeesan few more chances.,30
Why Thala why?,3
"Dhoni makes 3 changes in 3 matches. 

Uhmm I guess we know who the imposter is.",5
Gang gang,1
"Man wtf jadhav is back .

Wtf,wtf?",2
I'm already cringing at the thought of our Kezhavan XI facing Rabada and Nortje.,17
KEDHAV JADHAV IS BACKKKKKK BOISSS,3
"I said it the previous and I'll say it again.

I feel bad for the youngsters in CSK squad.",15
Scenes if CSK wins today,8
"Csk killing fans .. man why do we need jadhav back? He doesn’t bowl, doesn’t field and doesn’t BAT.. so hard being a csk fan this year",5
Jadhav : You could not live with your success. Where did that bring you? Back to me,9
Jagadeeshan batted so well in his one chance.,5
"Welcome back Kedar, great to see you up and running on the cricket field once again 😂",5
Dropping gaikwad and jagdeesan after 1 or 2 matches is literally Fucking stupid.,9
Inb4 jadhav 100(43),3
Whom should I take between axar and ashwin for dream 11,-1
Dhoni trying to out think RCB management,3
Onto CSK v DC after that stupid ass performance by RR. Any breaking news?,4
Totally pumped up after ABD storm.,4
Bit of a breather- Sanga you are what we say dead wrong,4
CSK went very hard after Unadkat in both the 2018 and 2019 auctions,3
Jadhav is back in place of Piyush as per Dhoni. Yes we believe,4
It’s better for youngsters from TN if Dhoni retires from CSK. There are a lot of youngsters trying to get a game to prove their talent. And for fuck sake again they chose Jadhav. If he’s performing it makes sense. But this is just bullshit.,12
Delhi was jot the team to try jadhav against and i am pissed,9
"Just came to know that this match is in Sharjah...

R.I.P CSK.... See you next year.",8
"I understand backing the experienced guys when the team is doing well, but dammit, give guys like Sai Kishore and Jaggi chances when everyone is doing fuckall.",5
"Jadhav ain't a hitter...
Bowls spin...

What's the value of him in sharjah ??",4
"I’m off a high from the RCB win, hopefully it continues with dehli winning today",3
Well that was a brief break up before the patch up..Jadhav is back..Pathetic,6
"Yep Jadhav in again.

CSK loss goes brrrrrrrrrrrrr",3
"Big brain move from csk by playing jadhav, nice",2
Kedar jadhav🖤🖤🖤🖤,3
WILL KEDAR JADHAV PLAY WITH HIS BRUTE DOT BALL BAT OR HARDHITTING DOT BALL BAT ?,3
"Rooting for Deli so Kings XI can jump back in that table, slowly but surely.",4
Beat DC 👊,1
Good to see jadhav the dot ball specialist back in action,1
"Fucking CSK. What did Jaggi do to be dropped out? What did Jadhav do to get a place in this XI? Seriously, Dhoni, I can't even.",76
"Given that they have picked Kedar, Dhoni better continue to live on what he said a couple matches ago where he said that instead of taking it deep they'd rather hit early and put pressure on opposition bowlers, hopefully Jadhav is aware of this plan and hits early instead of trying to take it deep and get out.",3
"Uthappa was memed back to form today, who knows it might work on Jadhav as well.",4
"Pantless again, at least we'll have him in the next one.",1
Can’t believe they picked Jadhav after the atrocious performance he had.,3
"Dhoni at toss : ""Looks like test wicket""

Oh boy",11
"Kedar Jadhav's HiGHeST sCorE this season came against Delhi Capitals 26(21) xD.. 


Can't think of any other reason to bring him back into the squad..",61
CSK'S win percentage went down from 60 to 58% on cricviz when they announced Jadhav was playing.,55
"Anrich Nortje will hit 160 kmph today blasting out Dhoni's middle stump. Calling it before the match starts.

I'm going for 2/3

Edit: added Dhoni",5
Whats Unadkat’s boost stamina score?,3
Kedar again?? *sigh*,3
"Raina isn't there from day 1 so.did bhajji ...
For f**k sake why there aren't any replacements ??",1
Jadhav is back. CSK fans should riot to keep him out.,13
"BAT CAREY AT 3, COWARDS
BRING RAHANE IN FOR THE SPIN",6
"Inb4 DC wins, MOM jadhav",2
Can’t wait to watch Thala and Jadhav bat together. Helps those who suffer from low BP,5
I want Jadhav to bowl his side arm offies and get tonked for 36 off an over,10
"Jadhav is gonna play a blistering 7*(15) to win the match for DC. 
On a serious note - Are you fuckin kidding me? Jagadeesan gets dropped after one inning. And this guy gets his spot back like nothing ever happened. Ridiculous.",24
"As someone who's mainly here to support the England boys that RR match was pure depression, so I feel I'm owed a Sam Curran 100* now",12
Carey and Rahane have nothing to lose now pls play explosively pls,3
Unpopular opinion: Dhonis team is not missing Raina as much as the Super doctored Chennai pitches made to specifically give them advantage.,6
[deleted],7
I love how white ppl say Shikhar Dhawan,2
That awkward moment when Jadhav puts in a match winning innings and the sub goes silent,9
Wtf. Jadhav is in . Fuck this shit. Why not jagadeesan?.,12
"The man, the myth, the legend is back. Jadhau",4
"You know guys, after supporting RCB it's going to be a pleasure watching this game as a neutral.",4
One of those baffling decisions from the CSK management again. Remember one year they somehow demoted Bravo after he played a match winning knock against Mumbai so that he almost never got to bat again.,3
"Dhoni to CSK : Give me finisher like Raina.

CSK : Nope

Dhoni : Give me spinner like Bhajji.

CSK : Nope

Dhoni : Ok who do we have ?

CSK : JADHAV !!!",7
"aaj account delete kardunga csk hara toh, bhut hogaya bc",5
No Pant. No fun,4
"3 slots of the top 4 are almost confirmed. The fight for the remaining 1 slot is between  KKR, CSK and SRH now. Feels like RR are done by now.",9
"I can't get over the Jaggi drop at all. 


How can Badri 2.0 be dropped from a team where strike rotation is non existent.",11
You thought we could keep Kedar out for that long did you?,3
Rayudu looks like developmentally delayed Sangakkara,10
"At this point, I'm convinced Jadhav is involved in some deep shit with CSK management that gives him a lifetime immunity deal.",3
Jadhav redemption arc incoming,2
JADHAV LMAOO,1
"Under-fire Kedar Jadhav gets opportunity to redeem himself as he replaces Piyush Chawla in the playing XI.

nahi dekhna match",11
"CSK should never buy a youngster again. Guys like Gaikwad, Jagadeesan, Sai Kishore, Monu Singh etc. don't deserve this kind of treatment.",44
Sanga on comms!,4
"Yo let's go, Kumar Sanagakkara replacing Kevin Pieterson.",2
To think that dehli only lost twice. Once to a supers trying team like Mumbai and once to us lmao,3
DC BC,1
Sanga sounds like your typical Trinity College alum,5
How long are we going to stick with Shaw? Is this his last chance?,4
"Think about how Rituraj and Jagadeesan must have felt being picked by CSK in the auction. They'd probably be overjoyed at the chance of playing with such a great IPL team and looking forward to play under Dhoni's captaincy in front of such an adulating crowd.

Now think how they feel today...",12
Sangakkara is back!!!,3
"The ""Big 4"" only exists for test matches. Apart form Kohli, the other 3 are nowhere near the elite level in T20. In ODIs, there's Kohli, then daylight, then AB and Amla, and maybe Root and Ross Taylor.  
For T20, it's easily Gayle and AB are far ahead of everybody else.",2
Curran opening again time for some shithousery,2
Kedar Jadhav Redemption today??,0
Where are they gonna bat jadhav? Anything after 10th over is no. Before that is a waste too. Maybe at 11.,3
"Meanwhile, Raina is probably chilling in Jammu, watching the match with a smirk on his face.",4
Let's watch CSK lose another match after a Jadhav master class,3
"Curran opening again, good",6
Yaar yeh rohan commentary karega aisi toh nahi dekhna,2
just wondering what did jadhav do to convince msd to bring him back 🤔,3
Yesss Sammy let's goo,2
2020 's finale will be a Kedar Jhadav redemption arc,4
Nice to see faf fistbump someone before the game!,2
Man that bowling lineup is so intimidating,3
No disrespect to Sam Curran but I wanna see if he's gonna be boundary madness like usual vs Nortje and Rabada. I'll be impressed if he can,4
"'The standard of umpiring this tournament has been extremely good'

Mark Nicholas ladies and gentlemen",9
Weird to see DD bowling first,2
LMAO Showed recent records of everyone and specific historical record ( strike rate against dc in death overs) for dhenier in the montage.,3
Why exactly is Curran opening?,3
You know what's worse than watching jadhav bat? Watching it right after what AB just did.,11
"Faf and Watto should be their openers. Dunno why they keep changing the order so much. 

Curran is good at hitting at the end. Especially when Dhoni and Jadhav haven't been doing that job well.",1
What an innings by ABD tonight. I'm still in awe,6
"T20 Big 4 - Gayle, AB, Warner, Rohit",-1
What has Jaga done wrong for Jadhav to come in? Guess sticking and giving faith to your players just doesn't apply to young players,3
"Even if Jadhav somehow miraculously performs today, don't make a apology thread ffs. One good match doesnt negate two years of shit performance.",10
"You have KG and Nortje in your team, and you open the bowling with Tushar? Ok.",3
"Shaw 🤝 Curran

Smack the ball without worry club

Recent resignation: Sunil Narine",14
So this is how not qualifying for play-offs feels like.,4
How is kedhar jadhav supposed to tonk Rabada and Nortje? he couldn't hit Russel,1
Jadhav definitely has got dirt on CSK. How the fuck did he manage to sneak into playing 11? My 11 year old nephew would be a far better choice.,1
_the largest thing about him was his head_ lmao,2
"As a CSK fan since inception and a Dhoni fan, I have never felt this much hate for him and this team. Supporting a team during  hard times is one thing but including Kedar again is not right on any levels. 

Not giving a decently performing youngster and giving a place to a player who didn't perform for two consecutive seasons is wrong on so many levels. I can even brush it aside.

But seeing him warming up beside Dhoni says much. It says that Dhoni is a person who likes sychophancy so much. The sight of that is getting on my nerves. No offense on Kedar though as any player has their losing streak. He won matches for India in the past but this shitfest is on the captain and the management. 

Captain cool makes me lose my cool. Seeing though the perspective of a neutral it wants me to spew hate for this one. Sorry for the long rant.",15
Bc where are the PANTs,2
Wtf is with all the brain-dead decisions today?,1
[deleted],9
Pant gone from the tournament for good?,0
"Watson see swing

Uh oh panic time",1
"Commentators: ""CSK top 3 of CSK is settled with Faf, Watto and Rayudu.

In strides Curran

Commentators: ""...erm...""",1
Just see everybody will praise Dhoni's decision on bringing back Jadhav at end of match.,2
Is including Jadhav really strengthening the batting?,0
"Slowly but surely more and more tamizhans are getting fed up with CSK, I can see my Tamil expat friends get more and more fed up and supporting more exciting teams",1
DC's bowling line up is the most exciting bowling line up this season. Change my mind.,4
kedhar jadhav is one lucky guy,1
CSK opening with their best batsman,1
"Srh: struggling to find a bowler that can bowl 140+

Dc: it’s free real estate",15
180+ today by CSK?,2
Nice man nice catch. Nokia is the best man to ever exist.,4
Tushar you beauty,1
There we go.,4
"Incoming: 3-4 hours of the commentators raving about Dhoni no matter what he does.

And to think it seemed like we finally got them to stop saying ""Unacademy Cracking six, just like Dhoni the other night"" each time anybody hit a six every game since CSKs last one.",7
Whhhhaaaaattttttt,1
There goes CSK's best batsman. Brain dead batting that though,7
Out karo yaar sale ko,0
Fuck me,2
FFS,2
Let’s gooo,2
Unexpected 360 degree,2
Aight guys see you all in the next season,3
Damn CSK is an absolute graveyard for young indian cricketers. I feel for Jagadeesan and Gaikwad. They must feel shortchanged given how other teams give so many young players a reasonably long rope if they're even half decent.,8
so after all  Watson is opening tonight.,7
What a horrible day of IPL cricket this has been as an England fan,23
Fuck,4
Nokia connecting catches across boundaries,46
Lol actually what the fuck. I kind of hate being a CSK fan this year.,3
What’s with all the csk threads having so many serial down voters,6
Everyone is now an expert at taking the jump over boundary and back in catch.,16
Rolleee rollleeee rolleeee,1
Ah ffs unlucky Sam,9
"Yeah no point in watching now, gg DC, enjoy the cup this year.",4
Lol 0 for 1,1
Should I just stop watching?,7
Roll it ROLL IT!,6
Last year Kedar was feeding Dhoni from his plate. Did not that this ass licking works in cricket as well.,2
Makeshift openers shouldn’t face the first ball.,7
"3rd umpire- nice and slow , csk fans probably- personal attacc",5
Aaj lag raha hai CSK ki lene waali hai DC,5
We're rolling baby,3
aaj kedar  marega,3
Nortje’s performing ballet at the boundary wow,1
ROLL IT ROLL IT ROLL IT - Me to my friend,5
fade me please,5
"Nokia, my man",1
Always wondered why the on field umpire signals an 'up yours' to the third umpire while referring the decision.,4
Tailenders aren't going to succeed against this bowling attack,6
"Damn, Nokia kept his eyes on the boundary rope 

Great Job",1
DAMN,1
feeld of flae,1
 half the side gone too soon too early,4
"Came for the collapse, waited to see Jadhav-Dhoni's Tuk tuk",2
We were also 0/1 last match but we still won CSK have a chance rn pain.,2
Already?,1
Can someone rock & roll me please? 😔,2
Great awareness shown by Nortje,1
Looks like Watto is opening,1
"Oh no sam what have you done, you were the chosen one",1
"Nortje performing Dussehra Dandia dance steps, while taking that catch.",2
You have rabada and nokia but the first wicket goes to Tushar,0
"What's common between the third umpire and a 4th year engineering student

Roll it roll it roll it",5
Our tail has started.,2
Nice and slow,1
I just love watching DC because of Rabada and Nortje. Just a dream duo for any team.,2
"Nortje and Tushar, Delhi has struck gold with their finds this year",4
Now watch CSK painfully limp to 150,3
The sam Curran factor following the footsteps of the Sunil Narine factor,2
So that didn't work. Who else do we have?,1
Swann and morrison should do commentary together. Would be a laugh riot,2
What a chad nokia is turning out to be. Definitely one of my favourite quicks around,4
"**0.3** Deshpande to Curran, OUT, Deshpande bowls ahead of Rabada, and in three balls he has got Curran out. Sharp bouncer, over his right shoulder, Curran hooks, gets a top edge to third man, where Nortje is back-pedalling, takes it head high, keeps an eye on the rope, releases the ball before stepping over, and then comes back to take the catch **0-1**

SM Curran c Nortje b Deshpande 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",1
Shane Watson is probably happy that he is back to being a opener.,2
Umpire listening to limp Bizkit,2
[deleted],2
this sub should be deleted if kedar hits quick 50,5
First RR and now CSK. KKR might just make it to top 4 without actually winning a match. Top3 is sealed.,7
"i was gonna say this match is in the bag for csk (sharjah, won toss, bat first and all) but look at them go....",6
Bc Rabada and Nortje havent even started yet,9
"3rd ump- ""i have spoken""",1
just came out of the shower. Sam is already done 😭,8
So back to Watto 'opening' with Faf to tonight then,3
Thats so casual from nortje lol.,1
Can't blame Sam Curran.,7
Curran 2nd most important wicket right behind Du Plessis.,4
"We get Faf early somehow, and we're golden.",4
Wicket maiden incoming,5
"Now we see the actual CSK openers.

Just a wicket down",15
And this game they bring in Jadhav ffs,6
Today's gonna be masochistic.,7
Sam Curran opening is just Watson opening with extra steps.,26
Very inspired captaincy again from Iyer to give the young quick the best possible path to success,19
intent is temporary but a duck from csk opener is permanent,24
Sam Curran failed as an opener. Do I see Vijay making a comeback?,2
"CSK should play Santer over Bravo, at this age Santer gives better all around value than Bravo. Bravo can't bat anymore.",7
"Just tuned in, Lets Gooooo",0
There goes our chance of making it to playoffs,4
"Oh fuck, who got out?",5
Why do Indian moustaches not connect with beards?,-4
We were playing Harshal Patel over this dude. Like WTF!,6
gotta say currans edge went too far.,2
Scenes of Lord Kedhav does a Tewatia,3
BC Tushar launda theek bowler hai. ...Tushar is a decent enf bowler.,4
"Somehow, I feel that Kxip doesn't really deserve to be at the bottom of the table. If you are being honest and watch carefully, CSk and KKR jointly deserves that coveted spot.",4
"Tushar is a fantastic addition to this side, ngl",6
"How the fuck did that edge go so far, desperately unlucky tbh",8
DC in first over will be 10-0,1
nice... Chaddi start from CSK lol,2
"Secretly Faf must be happy, he was just talking about how change in opening partners messes things up a little.",2
ah Watson back to opening,3
Currantly things aren't looking too good :(,6
[deleted],1
Is it really pronounced Nokia? I thought it was Nortye,2
Great over Tushar,1
"""Out of the box"" moves like sending Curran/Narine only work well when it's a surprise and not the norm.",2
"on field umpires are busy making team on dream 11 this season, third umpires are doing their job almost in its entirety.",2
"Now that the child is out of the way, the adults to open the innings",8
Abbe yaar yeh rohan ko band karne ka button kaha hai,1
Any point in watching this match still not over ABD,1
In CSK everyone gets to bat. I think MSD should come next,2
from being a ball boy in IPL 08 to opening for Delhi in IPL 20. What 12 years can do for ya. Props to Tushar!,3
I just want to see what Jadhav does with the bat...,2
Is that Sangakkara in the commentary ?,2
Task 1: Can we reach the 3 digit score ?,-3
Rohan is an idiot,-1
Wtf I only see 2-3 CSK fans in the chat? Where r the rest of them??,1
"Mike Hesson seems to be the sorta guy who decided to use ""Matchups™ "" as the new flavour/buzzword of this IPL and then sent the memo to all other captains and coaches.",4
"CSK would rather clone another Kedar Jadhav, but wouldn't want to give Jagadeesh or any other players a chance to play.",9
Imagine Kedar facing up to the bowling of Nortje and Rabada.,-1
"Bringing Jadhav back in actually makes sense now, still would've liked to see more of Jagadeesan.",-1
Scenes if CSK is the one to break RCB's 49/10 innings.,9
yin yemsd v trust sounds like a dictatorship,-4
There isnt much exciting about this csk team aside from curran maybe,2
Wow.. we have Jadhav today.,8
Why did Jadhav come back?,5
"Faf: Can I kiss you Kagiso. 

Rabada: Lol, control Faf. We have cameras on us",7
Faf reminding Rabada his allegiance,8
STOP SHOWING THE REPLAY DO YOU WANT ME TO DIE,8
What a ahit start,2
Who trusts in MSD?,1
"Mark ""Stream of Consciousness"" Nicholas",3
Already can see CSK lose. Wtf is with all these dots. Kms.,2
The amount of CSK hate here is unbelievable!,3

Heavy ball is the technical term for it.,2
Rabada leagues ahead of his competition,2
"Unpopular opinion: Just like r/cricket memes Utthappa today, r/cricket might meme Kedar Jadhav too???",7
That replay gave me erection,2
Imagine scoring 27-2 in the powerplay on this ground,4
CSK gonna get spanked so hard today they will actually like it,2
"Today on the menu bois:

1. Dot balls
2. More dot balls",9
I like how Nortje and Tewatia essentially had the same catching play,1
Dropped Jagdeeshan for practically no fault only to play Jadhav. bUt dHoNi sHoWs fAiTh iN his pLaYeRs,9
Do they realize this is SHARJAH ?,2
"A maiden over in Sharjah during the ""CRED"" Powerplay is criminal",50
Maiden boisssss,1
This match is already lost,5
"Choke me, DadC",5
Maiden over lul.,3
Lovely maiden.,4
Maiden ffs,5
Rabada maiden 🥺,3
CSK looking good in the first session. Will look to score more after lunch.,6
"As the pitches wear, the DC attack will get harder and harder to deal with.",6
In b4 jadhav pulls out uthappa today,3
Mayank and Rahul are not game changers because they’ve not changed the result of any game this IPL,5
I dont think they will make 40 from powerplay,2
Boys are settling nicely. Expect them to pick up the pace post tea session.,6
This Dream11 game changer list is a sham. No Unadkat there.,3
"I can't fathom what CSK team meetings are like

Yeah Bois so next game is with DC, they've got Rabada & Nokia. How about we bring Jadhav back in team?

Management : Yea sounds good to us.",6
"Test match mode, do fuck all in the powerplay and hit a few sixes in the end to score a shitty 150. Why do I support this team?.",2
Honestly our batsmen will fail miserably when facing quality bowling like Delhi,3
"Rabada with the maiden, good shit boys!",2
"CSK's approach confuses the hell out of me. They have batting/competent slogging down to 10/11, yet they still play conservative for 15/20 overs. No energy whatsoever in the field or in the batting. The one bright spot all season with the batting has been Curran. If it was me, I would have given the likes of jagadeesan or Gaikwad a run at the top and ask them to play the Curran role, and bonus you still have Curran to smash the spinners in the middle",6
I really wanted DC to win the toss and bat first so we can see a proper innings. Instead we get this tuk tuk mess.,3
CSK will make a huge total of 24 runs in PP today,4
"me killing it in fantasy while my team sucks ass.

Thanos: soul for a soul",4

Someone take CSK behind the shed already,3
"Watson playing Maiden is never a good sign for opposition team.

Goddamn maiden over. KG is actually unreal,5
Only few things in life gives more pleasure than watching CSK getting fucked,6
"Maiden at Sharjah, wow!",3
"This is T20, right?",4
Watson striking at 0.00. Looks good,5
Big brain move to bring in a batsman who gets his runs by manoeuvering the field on the smallest ground where six hitters are necessary.,2
Whats the highest no. of wkts taken by purple cap holder in an IPL season?,4
CSK back to 3 runs in 2 over classic style.,4
That wide added 33% of score,8
Looking solid. As long as they don't lose more wickets in first session. They should hang in there till lunch.,7
I’m just here to watch Nokia try and beat 161.3 km/h,5
Maiden at Sharjah what does Rabada eat,6
Does this mean good ol' Watson is back?,2
"2 overs 2 runs 1 wickets, start cannot get any shitier than this",4
"Damn, a maiden in T20.",8
End my misery,7
Imagine playing a maiden at Sharjah.. needs talent.,9
Jayadev Jadhav,1
imagine supporting this side every game to see this in the PP repeated! smh,3
People where criticizing RR's powerplay. They got nothing on us mates.,7
I remember one more Watson innings where he started with a maiden,7
CSK back to its traditional scoring rates.,2

I will cry i swear to god,2
Is Dhoni keeping kedar in the team just so that he would not be the worst batsman currently in the team?,8
I’m bored of my team.,3
Tushar started with a wide to pay his respects to CSK,7
Just to remind you all.  This is Sharjah btw,5
Mark my words Faf's gonna smash today! Dude is ready to explode,2
CSK forgot their whites,7
"CRED ""powerplay""",0
Delhi are gonna chase this down in the powerplay,1
As a fan I feel like CSK just don’t care,1
Fantastic rabada,1
"Csk has very small problems 


They play too slow in Power Play

They don't rotate during Middle Overs

They don't have the fire power they used to in the Death Overs

I would have played Tahir for either Sam or bravo.,1
"If a ball bowled by Nokia hits a Nokia phone, do we get a blackhole?",2

"Let's tire out the quicks this session, good strategy",3
Shane Dotson & Dut Plessis,5
good test start,0
I sense a charge down the ground from Faf,2
This is Sharjah and they're playing test match cricket.,7
How to play for NRR when batting first? -- CSK probably,9
"If CSK wanted oldies, they should buy Sanga ffs",4
whats the pitch in sharjah like today?,3
I am excited for another fiery over from Northje like the one against Buttler.,4
CSK making every bowler look like Malcom Marshall,4
RR of 1.29 is slow for tests lmao,6
"I swear l, I have never seen a t20 run rate lesser than that in my life.",4
Welcome to the first day of test match,5
"Unpopular opinion: CSK team is suffering from some serious PTSD or some sort of depression, maybe idk?",5
This game is too tough for CSK. DC is too OP,-1
Need to give the bowlers the first hour so that you can capitalize on the rest of the overs. Good strategy by CSK.,3
Sanga must be wondering why he had to draw the short straw to have to sit there and listen to Mark Nicholas talking crap ... sorry *Burger King Crap*,2
What is this test,4
Rons,3
csk openers batting like they've Hardick Pollard and ABD to get them runs in the middle,4
Can someone notify me to watch the match when it gets interesting,3
playing deshpande like he's glen mcgrath. wtaf csk?,2
Get Axar and he might start reducing their runs even /s,1
Even Test matches have quicker starts nowadays,5
Dhoni thinks like a typical uncle now. He would rather prefer putting money in FD (Kedar) than Mutual funds (Jagadeesan).,6
This would've been a bad start even for a Test match,4
Do they realize Nokia is due after this?,4
"CSK fans are so calm this season, usually they are the one who sparks the debates and arguments with their mad support. It feels good to see CSK going down one time.",4
This is a conservative start to a test match let alone a T20,3
Why is CSK staff uncle not wearing mask on nose smh?,2
Making good use of fielding restrictions,1
"man I thought WE started slow, this is something else",2
"Motherlover Rankings.

DC has 2 motherlovers

MI has 1

KXIP has 1

Therefore DC Champions 2020? 🤔",6
Rabada can actually bowl 4 overs on the trot and CSK would not wish to attack,2
"Curran came out swinging

I thought it'll be different today :(",3
"There you go, so many asked for it",2
tf you doing? itna pressure kaha se aa gaya bhenchoddd,3
is this a CSK thing or did the pitch really change?,2
DC vs CSK test series Day 1.,7
Only way CSK has hope in being competitive in this match is if Watson makes a century and Faf a half century.,5
Watch Shaw hammer 30 of 9 on the same pitch,6
"Delhi fans don't get cocky lol.

It's just one wicket of a bowler.",7
"Watson hits a four 
Mark Nicholas : ""ThIs WhAt WaTsOn BrInGs To ThE tEaM""",7
Hindi comms are already sucking off Dhoni. At least let him come out to bat first.,10
"So my fellow MI fans, who you supporting this game? I'm going with DC since they have 4 Mumbaikars in their lineup today",1
It’s not just that we have had a losing season. We have played a boring brand of cricket. It’s been pathetic. Completely uninspired.,4
This field has never looked bigger lmao,1
Good going CSK. Needed some calmness after that AB finish in the other match.,1
Rohan Gavaskar is surprisingly soooo good in commentary. Better than any Indian barring Harsha,2
Lol Faf impressed with the Watson's drive,2
65 million years. Zap,2
4 rpo means a score of 80,-4
Thing is CSK still thinks of itself as peak CSK when it is not and are not willing to acknowledge the faults within the team,6
"OMG a boundary, not so fast guys, don't take too many risks.",1
i don’t think there’s any other people other than csk fans supporting csk rn,5
Told you guys. Typical Watto century after playing a Maiden incoming,4
That single dramatically raises the run rate from 1.29 to 1.60. The excitement is palpable.,1
Watson punching it nicely.,3
Wow didn't know it was Sharjah,-1
"After hitting four
Le csk batsmen: now next shot after 4 balls",0
"Batsmen hits a shot

Swann: _is that a crunch_",-1
csk dont even have pollard/ab/russell type power hitters in the middle order/tail to make up for the wasted 2 overs.,4
Typical CSK make a T20 Saturday night feel like after lunch session in Colombo,8
Just in! CSK management is considering a mid season  transfer of MDH masala uncle,6
"I don't know when this sub will understand kedhav Jadhav is too op for batting or bowling. Whenever he hits a boundary, he changes his bat to make sure that mistake doesn't happen",6
Watto's remembered what format he's playing,1
Run rate 4 😎,4
"being a csk fan, it's hard to accept that delhi will win in 9th over 🤧😢",1
Time for nokia to bowl them 156 km/h yorkers that send the stumps flying,2
Watson taking balls to settle gives him scoring a centrury vibe. Like the finals,0
"The more you think about is the more impressed you get about DC performance in this year's IPL. They have to deal with injuries to 4/5 of their players, and on points table they're only behind a team who has no major injury scare, and played 6 of their 8 games in one ground. This DC team has crazy good depth in their squad.",6
"How does Jadhav have same striker rate as Jadeja?

Edit : Fuck you serial downvoter?",1
"Watson says fuck running, it's either gonna be a dot ball or a boundary with him LOL",6
rabada a fantasy goat,2
Csk is probably the most unliekable team rn unless your a csk fan,22
"I feel like i am in the stale part of a relationship and I am eying younger, more bubbly girls. Like the in one from Bangalore or maybe the baddie from Delhi",-4
Imagine ending up with 49/1 at 20 overs,7
I decided to watch this match thinking it would be entertaining to watch with Curran opening! FML,4
This is peak CSK. They don't even try to score singles or run anything down.,1
Watto finally remembered they're at Sharjah.,1
"okay, downvote bot is here.",2
"%You shouldn't be leading the team if you're not inspiring enough**

Dhoni's achieved almost everything. I don't see any appetite for success in him.",2
Is axar a leggie? I don’t know that much about spin to tell,2
MSD’s stats this season? Wondering if he deserves the slack this season,1
Give Deshpande another over?,2
Plz Watson and Faf give a 200 run partnership,6
"really good bowling strategy from DC. Surprised the batters with deshpande, and now they're not letting them settle with all these changes. smart.",3
This thread is unusually quiet today🤔,-1
I wanna scold each and every CSK player. Just to get it all out,-1
"Is it time to bring Jadhav into form, r/cricket?",9
Woah. Axar got Watto out 6 out if 8. That's insane,10
Downvoter is here bois,3
I dont think the downvoter is a csk fan idk why,-10
Kya ❤️du batting hai,1
"Steps out for a single, thala would be proud",0
Had a terrible dream about AB being transferred to a different team mid season,5
Dot or Boundary. That's the gameplan here,7
wild how they're so good at not playing good in PP,5
Running between the wicket has been CSKs biggest negative this season. They just don't rotate the strike enough.,3
Just like that 4 overs done. AB got 10 runs more off of one over in the earlier match ffs,6
downvoter got nothing else to do on a saturday? sad life.,3
Do CSK realize that if they win this they jump up to the 4th position? Or is Thala busy calculating what is the optimal number of maidens this retirement home team should play?,8
"As a KKR fan life is simple, hope every team above us Wins, every team below us Fails and we never play MI ever again.",13
Brave,0
Give one more to Tushar in power play if possible.,-1
"As a longtime csk fan i'm so, so heartbroken to see what our team has become. From an assured playoff berth every season to at times purposefully losing games... what a downfall. Almost makes me want to turn my back on this team.",0
Noice FAF!!,1
Nortje and ramps.... lmao,2
"Scooping Nortje. Where have I seen this before?

Great shot though.",1
Well Buttler did that too.,2
"They are playing Lamborghini song between the overs at Sharjah.  Meanwhile, CSK is driving Maruti 800.",3
The best thing that can happen to CSK now is DC getting a wicket and rayudu boi comes in,2
Italians are committing mass seppuku after seeing that dominos ad with Pasta on pizza.,5

anything less than 200 is too less in this ground,3
Where have I seen this...,3
Scoop 6. 156 kmph ball incoming from Nokia,3
Nokia : I just had Deja Vu,5
Same script,1
Lol first ball!,1
He did my boy Nokia dirty. Time for revenge,2
158 incoming,3
Buttler dejavu,3
"Uh oh. Let me guess. Faf does another like this, and the Nortje throws a 170kmh ball and destroys FAf through a clean bowl",5
Faf please don't piss off Nortje please. Please.,10
It's so weird that a downvoter is here whenever a CSK match happens.,2
Scooping Nokia for a six? Be prepared for 155 kmph deliveries,5
Srini mama never let this happen to CSK. THOSE GOOD OLD TIMES,2
These two are muscular duos,5
Nokia fucked,-1
Fafdu treating Nokia like he's Unadkunt,7
Genuine Q tho. Why play this ground if its so small?,2
lol now he'll bowl 156,6
There should be a system where we can rate the commentator during the live match.,4
"Oh no don't do this Faf to Nokia 

156kmph coming on your way",9
"I think if CSK can get their shit together they can reach the playoffs they have no competition 

Winning the IPl is another story tho",7
160 coming up today ?,3
Kumar sounds all elegant and royal and shit,10
Typical csk. Score a six and eat the rest of the over.,4
All ik is butler played the same shot before getting out the other day,3
[deleted],3
Is this Sharjah or Chidambaram stadium? Coz they batting as if it’s Chennai,4
Sanga's so much better than KP,9
Tuu nu-nu nuuu tu-nu nu-nu nuunuuu,1
RCB and DC have got the best team.,2
We make scoring 5 an over look so fucking difficult with audacious shots,8
"I wouldn't do that if I were you

- Buttler probably",12
Does one six really make up for 6 dot balls? I suppose technically so.,-3
Jeez CSK supporters are so negative.,8
Petition for a Sanjay Sanga swap in the dugout.,9
Nothing like a Watson Far Carnage. No more of tuk tuk please,8
"-	IPL 2020
-	power play
-	runrate 3.74 in 4 overs
-	one wicket lost already

You don’t even need to ask what team this might be, everybody knows lol",-1
"jeez faf, keep em coming bro",2
"Ffs, How fucking dots csk has played so far",3
This was a horrible over. We’re gonna lose this match.,-4
"Wait what? A csk player is in orange cap list?! I'm actually genuinely surprised, I didn't know one of them made it there considering recent performances",8
Nokia just got Unadkunted,11
Faf sure has a scary staring eyes while he is watching the bowler.,5
CSK trying to take it deep right from the 1st innings.,5
South African batsman just love pace on the ball,9
Hopefully get going now. Already most of power play wasted. Anything below 180 is sub par here.,5
Oh man! Sangakkara is such a brilliant commentator.. So nice!,10
Faf me up,6
These two are our only hope now 🥺,4
nortje 50% unadkat,-2
Sense a wicket in this over,-2
That shot was an orgasm.,3
"I really miss that Pune team with Faf, Dhoni, Jinx Rahane, Ravi Ashwin and Steve Smith.",8
comeon rabada!,1
Y'all thought Nokia would do Butler to Faf !,6
[deleted],6
Curran flopped today. Questionable captaincy from Dhoni to continue with the Curran experiment.,-4
"Nokia: Unadkat is my inspiration, I like getting fucked by South Africans",5
"If you touch a positively charged surface with CSK fans, it Completes the circuit.",7
Curran should come in 2 down when the spinners are bowling. He's seems pretty comfortable against left arm spinners and leggies.,4
"How the hell is KL a game changer?

Dude could not take a single of the last two balls to win it for his team.",13
"Off topic, If Padikkal scores 30+ we win. Story of this season.",2
Faf has experience playing with KG and Nokia. Don't know why people are acting suprised,14
South Africans have been by far the best overseas group of players this year.,5
So Nortje turned from Dale Steyn to Varun Aaron,2
Faf is single handedly saving face for our team in the powerplay now.,3
Nehra still going on about length. Oh man the memes are true.,6
Rahul top of the game changer list? Lol is it for the other team?,5
Feel like faf is gonna go after rabada,4
Can we please have a world T20 tourn while the SA players are in form,4
no ashwin in powerplay today??,2
"Seeing all the boundaries hit, I thought the RR might be 7 to 8",3
South Africa always have such great players but somehow always choke in ICC tournaments,5
South Africans doing so well in IPL. T20 WC contenders for sure,3
In any other case I would have criticized rabada for hitting the wickets when they clear made but in this case ik they can’t run fast enough so is it’s too mad lol,2
"Csk roster considered World Heritage Site, that’s why so difficult to make changes",4
Faf says 'do please' to his countrymen coming at him at pace,1
"*BONK*

Go to low rr jail",3
imagining 150 kmph sizzling length deliveries by Nortje/Rabada to Jadhav and umpire calling that bouncer for the over,3
This is bad we need a wicket asap,2
"nortje is so pretty can't take my eyes off him, lmao",0
[deleted],0
Is it a Festival today in South Africa or Something,3
Smoked. Faf is on song today. Just hope there's no stupid mishaps for him.,2
If CSK get to 100 without losing a wicket they should just look to slog every ba to the boundary,2
Damn that slow ball deserved a wicket,7
Watson:**Let's put some pressure on faf**,9
"Tbh, don't even care if CSK don't win the IPL. Just want them to make the playoffs at the very least",14
Why the fuck are we bowling South African bowlers to Du Plessis!,7
Quick someone take a screenshot,9
Oh faf oh faf oh faf. Fucked,13
Lmao rabada,11
Watson can dominate on this small ground if he gets set,13
Did KG just humped Faf?,28
That should have been a run out! Who the fuck is the fielder.,6
Meme material pic available now. Rabada humps Faf,13
That pose is meme material. Lol,14
The one time we grab a single.,17
That was wholesome,8
Wholesome 100,12
Rabada tactically injuring Fafdu there.,11
Interracial in the middle of the ground?,20
Is this how Chennai will counter Rabada,16
Wholesome collision,10
Rabada just wanted a hug 🤗,8
Meme Alert. Meme Alter. Meme Alert. Wtf Rabada,14
Faf was running fast,3
Aww kawaii,5
WHOLESOMENESS,7
Ok get a room now,14
Rabada established dominance by that doggy style hug,40
This will do wonders for our FairPlay^TM points moral victory. Fuck the title give us those points.,6
Faf knows how to deal with his countrymen,2
turned into a nfl game lmao,3
Bc how did Rabada not get hurt there? 😱,5
Just started watching this match..why tf is Jadhav back in??!,4
Wholesome and meme material at the same time.,9
Uh rabada I don't think you can do that in UAE,107
Rabada should kiss Faf now,8
Those youtube thumbnails got something to play with !,17
Black on white crime.,3
If DC wins today I know which meme to post.,7
"Breaking News:

*Rabada mysteriously dropped from SA squad.*",86
Get yourself a gf who hugs you like how Rabada hugged Faf.,36
"Genuine Q. Faf rushed full speed into Rabada, rabda came out unscathed, but FAf got hurt bad? How?",16
"ngl , I would be in hospital rn if I got hit like that",3
Damn faf should get rid of his towel .... Almost looked like it's going to hit the stump.,6
"FFS I THOUGHT THAT'S SERIOUS, THEY WERE LAUGHING LOL",23
The great south african clash,18
Rabada is a cutie hahaa,10
The only fair thing now is Faf giving Rabada a forehead kiss,35
"Faf don't play with so much intent or else they'll make u warm the bench, u have to follow csk ideology",2
"Jeez, Rabada is strong. Got up like it was nothing.",8
RR low on fair play table thanks to lord Tewatia?,13
Impossible. Current RR is above 6,14
Smiling Rabada ...the most handsome man in cricket . Followed closely by Faf.,33
Rabada should say no homo now,16
"End of powerplay : 6+ RR

we are winning this folks!!!",16
"Rabada was stationary, Faf was moving. The collision should’ve hurt the stationary person",14
Curran got unlucly or else we would have had a good start,42
Hope Kedhar Jadhav hit his first six and shut me up.,8
Nobody can chase anything decent at Sharjah,-9
What a piss poor powerplay,-7
Shit rabada is so big,10
"If we can't hit Rabada, we try to destroy him.",-1
i want rabada to hug me like that :(,7
Pretty good power play by csk now,7
We got the record boys. Worst PP here. WooHoo!!,5
Rabada is such a likeable guy.,24
Holyshit they've more runs scored than balls played.,1
"39-1 GOOD POWERPLAY!!! 

WTF are the commentators smoking?",0
"Morris, Nortje, Rabada, du Plessis, de Kock, ABD

This is the African IPL!",33
"worst powerplay in sharjah, but considering they were at 1.5 at one point this is good recovery.",6
Thala will be winning this for Delhi with their best player down already,3
Replay from the side angle looked like Faf ran to spear on Rabada,9
What is nohit/brohit for Watson,6
No respect for hypotenuse of heat,5
"Faf on all fours: Good lord, it hurts like a motherfucker

Rabada: Gay pride worldwide",16
The IPL has evolved from bowlers like Yo Mahesh and Sumit Narwal bowling at a max speed of 125 kmph to Rabada and Nortje bowling 127 kmph slower deliveries.,8
Wtf was Faf trying to do there.. If he din't see Rabada in his peripheral vision he really needs to get his eyes checked.,14
Rabada is yearning for that kiss from Faf.,6
Ok I see a Rabada faf youtube video thumbnail in near future,74
"If CSK makes 160, they win as DC's batting isn't that great..knowing Shaw is a free wicket.",5
"Faf after he returns to the dressing room.

Dhoni : You know I could put him out of action for a while just like you did if you want me to!

Faf : ffs MS, he's our best bowler. We can't even use Steyn anymore.",-1
Watson pls don't give your wicket to Axar again today.,3
"Hahaha, styris throwing shade at the spirit of cricket bois",4
"Worst powerplay score at Sharjah in 2020

Of course",6
Faf Rabada THE REAL show down.,4
man they way rabada got hit it pained me deeply,5
I get a gut feel that CSK is gonna win this match... Its too many wins for DC,11
I know it's easy to be an armchair analyst but I'm wondering why can't give themselves room and smash it. The balls are not really turning that much.,-2
Faf and KG together will make really beautiful kids. (◍•ᴗ•◍),12
Can the fielding team withdraw an appeal for a runout?,-2
Rabada and Faf knocking into each other: The Saffers send their regards,2
axar is their tall jaddu,2
"Replay clearly shows Faf putting his head down with the helmet pointing Rabada and with his left arm up as shield while pushing for that run. He basically shield bashed Rabada, haha.
Reminds me of Dhoni doing a similar act",8
Ffs they can't score 6 an over off axar.,2
CSK making 40 off the Powerplay look like a HUUUUGE achievement,8
Arre bhai bhai bhai bhai meme template fits with this collusion.,5
Come on wide boiii....Do something magical that you do😇,5
Has Jadeja and Axar ever bowled in tandem. If so how quickly did the innings finish.,5
I don't understand why Shimron doesn't keep ...he is way more explosive batsman than Carey? Is this ponting putting Aussies first?,1
180 and csk's batted dc out of the game,6
**Fuck off downvoter**,-3
Saw 14 off Nortje and thought CSK were off to a flier... alas runrate 6.5,15
"En veetu kannu kutty, enoda mallu kati moment

Axar has been excellent this IPL while going under the radar due to other star performers.,3
Yeah take those singles. They are the recipe for success. Cause it is really hard to clear those 90m boundaries.,12
Ex-CSK ethical boy vs CSK boys,9
"CSK demotes Watson, promote Curran indicating that they need fiery batters

I think CSK has a good chance in this match. DC might collapse if Dhawan fails.,8
Iyer is going to Stoinis at some point isn’t he?,-2

"You folks think Sam was told to go out there and swing from ball one, or was that a personal choice? Just WAIT for a few balls at least.",1

We should keep Rahane as long as possible in the crease when he bats.,1
Nice burn from Styris about Swann using spirit of cricket as an argument against non-striker run outs. Talking about appealing for a run out after a collision between the runner and the bowler.,6
Do Faf and Watto realize that Stoinis Iyer Shaw will be batting here later?,3
"If capitalism is ethical, faf will get big bucks next auction",3

T: Axar we miss you",5
It's a bit nippy isn't it watto?,4
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺,4
Wtf ash,7
"Good time for Ashwin to look for Mankading, only we he is getting wicket today",3
Umpire almost lost his head.,2
Just want Ethics to run Dhoni out so he can be exposed as the run stealing fraud he is,-4
Pitaji 💣,7
Why do commentators suck CSKs d*ck all the time metaphorically speaking,12
Ashwin has a nice smile after Rabada.,4
That was a shocker from Ash,10
Wtf he was bowling.,6
If these two stay for a while jadhav won't bat today :),5
"CSK have been weak ever since 2014 which coincides with fabulous form of Raina, they were never as threatening afterwards, just scraped wins.",1
lmao not bad,2
Short and wide is something a spinner should not bowl repeatedly,3
What an over this has been for CSK! 15 runs! Finally some much needed boundaries!,1
"CSK have the best batting avg (41.93) and have lost the least number of wickets (14) in the 7-16 over phase this season.

DC have taken the most number of wickets (27) and have the best bowling strike-rate (17.78) among all teams in the same phase.",11
Looks like the diesel engine has finally warmed up.,7
"Ashwin getting fucked by Watson, are we in 2010",3
Bull Watto pounding virgin ash,4
*dream11 hostage fans,4
Is mankad considered as run out or wicket to bowler?,1
"Delhi have lost their only match chasing this season. Anything above 160 is gonna be a struggle for them, especially if Shaw gets out early. The batting unit is pretty weak minus Pant and Hetmyer; lucky to get away in the last game vs RR.",1
Fuck yeah much needed over,3
Well that was a shit over from Ash,3
 15 off the over.,4
Why are CSK so conservative in the powerplay? They could get to much better scores if they at least scored 8 rpo in the PP,6
That was terrible from Ashwin. Too loose,3
Usually CSK lose both their batsman after 10th over. I hope that doesn't happen and Faf and Watto go bezerk.,3
O pencho!! What a shot!! Faf ❤️,4
"""projected score for 10/over""

the force is strong with this one",4
"shit, we are going to need all of our batting depth",3
"GUYS GUYS, our run rate is 7+ now.",10
"Here comes Tushar, there goes Tushar.",6
[deleted],5
Daily reminder white hat Jr is scam,89
CSK gonna kill this dude,4
Why do all the good shots happen only when I head to grab snack or take a leak?,1
Woah got a boner after that shot,1
Fuck we need a wicket now,6
My boi thusar gonna go for some runs today.,0
dhoni will love this pitch.,4
chodega aaj fap aapna,-3
Agent Ashwin doing his job,8
Really Pommie? Is the game so boring that you want us to look at the traffic?,2
Genuine Q. How's the altroz compare to the Harrier and that other smaller one called Nexa or something?,3
200 is definetly on the cards!,2
110 runs in theses 10 overs necessary to maintain a fighting chance,0
Happy Birthday to Badrinath's daughter,10
"I THINK THEY SHOULD GO ALL OUT NOW, IT'S TIME",7
A C C E L A R A T I O N,4
Altroz is a meme car now. Thank you guys.,13
Half way through gotta appreciate the management and the operations team for pulling this IPL off. It feels like just as well organised as any other IPL. Hopefully everything ends well as well.,15
Altroz sounds more like a mosquito killer than a car's name.,13
"No,Daddy Faf looks injured. 

God, why don't you just kill me already!",7
This partnership is getting a bit out of hand,6
And so the gaping begins.,0
"Fuck yes, more of this please",2
"As a CSK fan, I have terrifying memories of Watson thrashing Ash.

Well well how the turntables.",9
i n t e n t™ is back. babbyyyy,9
"This is Sharjah, right?",8
I'm actually legitamtely scared FAf will get out with all those risky shots. Or maybe it's just me used to usual csk innings,5
We need a mankad asap these guys aren’t gonna get out normally.,-4
Faf is my captain today :)),8
INTENT. YES BABBYY,3
Is it a coincidence that CSK's match threads get marred by these downvotes,3
[deleted],1
Faf wants to one up ABD,3
CSK turns 3s into 2s and 2s into 1s.,5
These team chants are faker than porn acting,8
"On a slow pitch where bowlers are guaranteed to take the pace off, surely you can swap tactics by literally waiting for the slower balls in the over and sending them while just dabbing the quicker ones for a single. Or is this easier said than done? It's what AB did against KKR the other day",2
You can't beat daddy Stoin,3
Faf is in good touch today.,4
Tushar Desh-pie-de,0
CSK running 2 is like 6,2
"5 overs of Nortje+Rabada left. Plunder these guys as much as you can, CSK.",5
"On this ground, they need atleast 175 on this pitch to make a match out of it",5
Shaw HAS to perform today. In fact all of our top order need to put up at least 30 runs,5
Looks like the first time our batters will have to save our bowlers. Every other game it has been the other way around,5
Lmao Dugout is fun when the Altroz comes on.,2
"In a theoretical universe where all the ipl teams perform the exact opposite as they do now, like CSK winning many matches, holding high rr, kxip dominating , rcb being rcb, etc, who would actually be winning and topping the table?",2
When Faf gets going he is just soooo classy,7
Where's my man u/Fad_du_pussy at?,3
The match bot should start every RCB match thread with a ee sala cup mamde,4
Looks like there's nothing wrong with the pitch. 180 to stay on the safer side!,6
Csk moved their runrate from 6 to 8 in 3 overs. Not bad,15
I apologise to Watson uncle! He is playing much better than last year!,10
"Finally a T20, Woohoo!",11
They can just about afford to go from here imo. With Bravo all the way down at 8 and the small ground they could really go for it,1
"prithvi has the capacity to get 80 odd in 7 overs, so faf better bat all the way till the end to have a shot at this.",1
"Faf shows me class, the kind of class that's been missing with the rest of the team other than Jadeja whilst batting. He's freely making runs without struggling. Would love to see Dhoni in that kind of form!",9
"Partnership: 85(63)
Last 5 overs: 46 runs, 0 wkts",13
*intent has entered the chat*,4
"Our runrate ranks during overs. 

1-6 => #7

We didn't need a fancy stat to figure out 😂",3
"Last match he bowled so well and people were praising him

Now one bad over and they call him a pie slinger

FICKLE FICKLE FICKLE",17
Great innings from duplessis man is a run machine,2
r/cricket has shipped Stoinis and Zampa since forever. But we have been ignoring the [Rabada-Faf](https://youtu.be/W6oTb2xgwEY) saga,16
**85 run partnership**,4
"Faf need a sticker on his bat ""Fuck it just Ramp""",1
Is it pronounced Nokia or Nothyee,7
"What the fuck is up with these obnoxious chants, lmao bro just play the random white noise crowd sounds",1
Great knock Faf. All class,2
The 0 on the Drs timer looked very blurry. Was it just me?,3
This doesn't even look like the dc team.,6
"damn, calling for DRS after Faf raised the bat.",13
The fuck is this review?,5
Bad review,4
Who reviewed this,4
What a waste of a review,3
Thats a terrible review I guess,7
50 :D,2
Hitting outside leg stump,1
Oye,1
Another 50 for Faf. He didn't even look that comfortable in the beginning.,2
Even without hitting the bat that is not out,1
why would they review that lmaoooo,1
That's a spike from bat hitting ground,2
ROLL IT GAGAN ROLL IT.,6
Shreyas you wasted that review,1
And this is what we call a Desperate review,1
Wtf its missing the bat wtf,4
Wasted,1
Who knew that with Watto at the crease he wouldn't be making the worst review,2
du Plessis's fifty! He raises his bat,2
Only Buttler + Morgan could take a worse review.,1
The spike is from bat hitting ground you dopey third umpire.,38
How is Ultra Edge monitor pulsing even when ball isn't touching the bat?,7
"Not only did it take an inside edge, it would've gone down leg.",-1
Watson: That's a great review.,5
"Chut, look at the left screen, there was a gap between the bat and the ball",5
That was missing leg but I don't think there was an edge,5
DC lose review!,3
Shocking review. Clearly going down leg,5
Didn't the bat hit the ground? Shit umpiring smh.,4
The spike isn’t even because of the ball on bat you blind cuck.,7
[deleted],2
Even if that spike is from the bat hitting the ground that's going down leg or umpire's call,2
"Saffas are on fire this ipl , assuming abd plays, then quinny, fap , abd , Morris, Rabada & Norte Fromm ipl, and still utility players like dussen & Andre Phel not playing ipl. This side would be good in T20 worldcup",2
Wtf bat hit the ground.,2
THERE WAS DAYLIGHT FFS,2
Me right now : grabs popcorn,1
Bat hitting the ground,2
GOT HIM FUCK YEAH,1
DD bowlers too afraid to take wickets as they know kedhav will come to bat,2
"If a wicket falls after 15 overs, they really should promote Jadeja up, with his cameos.",1
WHAT A BALL,3
Is it just me or I can see gap between bat and ball when the spike was there ?,10
Please send in jadeja,2
There is a clear gap between bat and ball. Wtf,4
Lol wrong decision but it's the right decision,5
Watch r/cricket explode now,4
"holy hell, we needed that!",2
"Watson, shame on you mate. N jagadeesan should open henceforth. He's not a hitter but he times the ball well and can run.",2
Let me guess it was 170kmh ball,2
"Faf has been so good in white ball cricket for a good chunk of time now.

Absolutely clutch for CSK and definitely a little underrated as well.",4
"wtf, he missed the bat hitting the ground !",3
Lol ump fucked up,5
Too fast for Watson.. what did the speed gun reading?,2
pure pace!! *slurp *slurp *slurp,2
Nice.,1
It wasn't hitting the bat,2
"That spike is due to bat hitting the ground, there’s clear gap between bat & ball. But it’s not out anyway.",7
Shreyas paying homage to Watto.,2
There's no use of technology when you have incompetent men operating it.,15
That was crazy from Umpire.,10
Just give it not out n move on..geez,2
"Goodness. What a horrible decision. Clearly that’s bat hitting ground. There was a huge gap between bat and ball. 

Still
Probably missing leg.",12
Guys who were dissing on Nortje you can just piss off,7
There's a spike while the ball is next to the bat but wasn't there a gap between the ball and bat in the close up angle? The spike came from the bat hitting the ground methinks,6
Bruh that spike was bat hitting the ground,6
BC bat hit the ground.,6
"NOKIAAAAAAA, MAH BOIIIIIIIII",3
The bat clearly hit the ground lol,2
Too much pace for watto man,4
That DID NOT look like it touched the bat,2
Yeah we were due for this one,3
Don't think it hit the bat lmao,4
what the fuck,2
That spike is because of bat touching the ground. Am i wrong? He was not out anyways.,15
Why does the third umpire has such a stereotypical Indian accent??,6
"Hahahaha he's smashed the ground wtf, but it was missing anyway",11
Where is Nortje from,2
"Pretty sure that was missing leg anyway, but he deffo didn't hit that",3
That was not a knock for the LB,2
Looks like today is the day where the South Africans shine,3
Nokia 5610 strike again!!!,2
[deleted],4
THEY SENT IN JADHAV I CANT STRESS ANYMORE,5
Good effort from the top. Now for the bottom to do absolutely nothing.,6
No no no,2
"The spike was before the ball was there, chutiya third umpire. But missing wickets most probably",5
"The bat was hitting the ground and there was clear space between bat and ball.. 

what a stupid decision from third umpire.",5
Is that fucking Jadhav?,8
What a shit 3rd umpire. BC bat hit the ground.,5
Jadhav pls,2
Third umpire blind. Albeit it would have missed stumpa,7
Wtffff???? Fuck you umpire. That was a clear bat on ground,6
"Bring Kedar in, he's going to tonk this bowler /s",2
"Get ready to lose DC , Jadhav is coming on /s",4
Hahaha! Third umpire is shit! The bat hit the ground and that was the spike idiot,3
WHY THE FUCK IS JADHAV COMING OUT,2
The umpires are embarrassing themselves at global level,6
"You could see a gap b/w ball and bat clearly from zoomed in image ,not an edge to me , might still be n.o.",4
tbh that was a decent innings from watson. did his bit.,3
We have a foundation now atleast.... Non existant lower middle order... Please do something,2
"Shocking 3rd umpire decision.
The bat hit the ground, the ball was clearly away from the bat.",6
Wtf? That was clearly bat hitting ground. But that was probably missing leg either way,8
"*One expensive over*

Is NoRtJe'S cArEeR oVeR?!???!",5
The spike was due to the bat hitting the ground right?,6
"Omg how can the 3rd umpire be so pathetic!

The cam clearly shows gap b/w bat and ball and at that moment bat hits ground hence the spike.

Ffs these guys can't even get it right with replays",12
"There's a spike with when the ball was near the bat

But also a clear gap when the ball was near the bat!


It was the right decision anyway with the ball drifting down leg....but.......",6
"**11.4** Nortje to Watson, OUT, top of middle with a 139ks length ball. On-pace, on-seam. Watson is looking to give himself room and swing, but does so down the wrong line **87-2**

SR Watson  b Nortje 36 (28b 6x4 0x6) SR: 128.57",1
lmao there was a gap but why is everyone crying like he was out lol,5
20kmph slower than the delivery that got Buttler out.,2
Nokia is a beast,7
"Jesus that was the bat hitting the ground, there was a huge gap between the bat and ball.",12
That's some ultra shitty level of umpiring. There was quite visible gap between bat and ball.,9
Shreyas obviously gave Watto an identity crisis with the review and distracted him.,11
[deleted],1
"Ape, Bajaj and TVS to become official sponsors of CSK after watching Rayudu bat",3
Which is worse in this IPL? Umpiring or Camera work,3
"If i were this incompetent at my job, i would be thrown in jail",1
Watson didn't score big but still a quite good inning,3
TIL: third umpire is blind.,4
Congrats Delhi :),1
Time to send Jadhav and let him complete his redemption arc and play a blinder so he can go back to instagram and abuse back all CSK fans who abused him ❤️,6
Partnership: 87(67),6
That wasn't out though.. Otherwise would be so pissed off.. How bad is the umpire,4
The ball was probably going down missing stumps but clearly a daylight between bat and ball ? TF is this village umpiring ?,13
Watson is too slow and old for Nokia,8
It's Rayudu you fuckers I was so scared,8
Lord Jadhav...,1
"It's rayudu fellas, not jadhav",3
TIL: third umpire is blind.,7
"**Most 50+ scores for CSK**

Raina - 33

Dhoni - 21

**Du Plessis - 14**

Hussey - 14",10
That is lamest fake cheer ever,3
Noooooo no Rayudu. He's gonna tuk tuk this man,1
That was a Watto-esque review used on the man himself. It was prophesied to happen.,3
BCCCCCeeeee BCCCCCeeeee BCCCCCeeeee,2
"Wtf, there was a gap.

Seriously maybe I should be a third umpire.",4
Hopefully Jadhav doesn't bat at all,5
CSK fans: expectations from Rayudu??,4
Now Rayudu will take 20 balls to settle in,10
What a shocking call from the 3rd umpire. He gave it not out when it was clearly.... not out,11
Why is jadhav in but not jagadeesan? Wtf.,10
"Good thing we have Jadhav to face Rabada/Nokia.


......said noone ever.",5
Rayudu isn't great against pace. This should be interesting,4
Let's all say Sayonara to any kind of running between the wickets.,5
"Get better third umpires if you're going to delegate everything to them, absolute braindead display rn",6
Nortje you beauty,2
CSK Chance of winning 0,-3
Classic 2020  CSK innings. Smack hard in first 10 overs or don't smack only > drop 2-3 wickets > tuktuk to 130,1
Nortje with the much needed wicket. Momentum shifts.,1
Rayudu looked clueless after the ball went past him lol.,7
I have never felt as neglected as much as Deep Dasgupta would feel in that My11circle ad.,2
"I mean I know the umpiring has been village level , but there’s no need to make fun of their accents. I’m sure you don’t sound any more posh. Bc angrez.",9
"Batting order from now should be: Dhoni, Jaddu, Bravo, Chahar, Jadhav. Dhoni showed intent in last matches.",6
Why does Rayudu wanna take on Nortje on his 2nd ball?,2
"Rayudu trying to come ahead and belt it, man its Nortje not 3D",6
I thiught Rayudu's arm fell out when the yellow thing flew,5
We all shit on our DR system but at least it isn't as bad as football's VAR.,10
They're trying to hit Nortje off the ground but didnt want to hit shitty bowlers from RR and SRH for boundaries? Wtf is wrong with CSK?,5
"Top of off stump exists.

Nortje: Gimme the ball.",3
160 is good on this track? I don't see us getting more unless Faf does something special,3
gonna enjoy watching Rayudu gaaru struggle against real pace,1

"Would've been umpire's call at best for hitting the stumps but could've retained their review, so still atrocious",3
Jadhav must have been hitting 200 meter sixes to be back in the team.,1
"Lol I actually thought there was no way third umpire could mess this up.

Never doubt the umpire!!",3
Run rayudu you cunt,1
Faf was not out anyways but the lost review could come back to bite them,1
"Well third Umpire shittiness aside, that wasn't out anyways cause it wasn't hitting the stumps.",1
Rayudu stumping incoming..... 🤷🏽‍♂️,1
Don't play with my heart like that faf,6
"Rayudu genuinely thinks running down the track will automatically send the ball for six. You're cutting your reaction time short by a solid 2 metres at a dude who's bowling 150kph. Congrats, you played yourself",8
Dhawan just dropped the match,7
WTF dhawan,4
Dear oh dear butterfingers,5

"Rayadu running 2s, peak 2020",9
They could have easily scored 4 more runs by running in the over,1
"All four balls went to shikhar. Shikha is probably like *idhar chala main, udhar chala. Jane kaha main kidhar chala*",8
Rayudu definitely gonna get stumped - bowlers are already bowling wide to him,3

"DC have done well to hide Shaw, but left Shaw Max pro+ exposed",6
"Why is Dhawan even out there, he's not someone I'd consider a good fielder.",3
Why is Rayudu getting fidgety? Jumping down the track on every ball smh,6

Our fielding has been absolute dogshit,7
"another fantastic spell from Axar, what an amazing tactical bowler he's turning out to be",7
Jhadav needs to come before Dhoni,-1
Is ultra edge only for bat hitting the ball? In last review I'm pretty sure I saw spike in ultra edge due to bat touching the ground but umpire didn't seem to care at all.,8

Dhawan can thank the third umpire for having the worst moment of the innings.,5
Lady Luck on Chennai’s side today.,0
"I am worried for Jadav. If later he's facing Nortje and gets hit on the body, he's gonna spinoff the ground like that Interstellar docking scene.",8
46/62 isn't horrible given the other ratios for dropped catches. Our catching has been pretty decent overall,1
Hate these timeouts. What's the point? Shove more ads down our throats?,3
"Scotty, how’s DC the worst catching team this IPL. They’ve taken 46 for christ’s sake",2

"A stat from Shiva Jayaraman: ""CSK touched a scoring of 7 runs an over for the first time in the innings off the last ball of 10th over today -the second latest for any team at Sharjah in this IPL. The latest was by Super Kings as well - on the last ball of the 13th over in their chase against Royals.""",9
What changed this season for Axar?,2
What is Dhoni's fascination with Jadhav?,9
Shikhar ain't a bad fielder; regardless of this drop. Dunno where Scotty came to that conclusion from.,4
Send Jadeja next. Thala and Jadhav can take the day off from batting.,12
FAF is unlucky to not be called the best South African rn still being on form like this,9
"Guys, how do umpires qualify?",3
"If Curran got going then we'd have 10-20 runs more. These two either need to accelerate now or get out and let Jadeja and Dhenier bat.

And if Dhoni sends Jadhav ahead of Jadeja I swear to God.........",4
send jadhav in ffs..,1
Our strategic timeouts are the worst. They usually bowl Stoinis after that which is so dumb!!,1
Anyone else watch porn during the time outs? Short scene recommendations?,3
Took me 10 minutes to calm myself after that easy drop catch. FFS man as I am typing this I am getting angry... Arrrrgg,3
Really wanted to see Rayudu face one more over of Nortje. Doesn't look like it'll happen,3

This is going so well for CSK. I don't know if I expected worse but damn. I hope they don't fuck up the next 6 overs.,1

No ball by Rabada. What can Rayudu do now off the free hit? Takes single.,2
Rayadu for Matrix 4.,5

Good thing shielding the indian pacer from Thala,5
The umpiring in this tournament has not been spectacular. Multiple instances of incompetence.,3
What even? If you bowl 2 bouncers an over you get a no ball. Y'all don't know the rules?,1

Dhoni for CSK or Brady for NE Patriots. Which one gets favoured most by the bias umpires/refs?,7

Playing for nrr in the first innings itself,5
I wish hotstar or some other streaming service offered 4k cricket.,1
"Holy fucking shit never thought I'd be pissed off by umpires this much, local kids playing have better standards and their example of replay is just someone recreating the trajectory with ball in their hands",4

"First the derby game, and now this


Fuck off match officials",1
That wasn’t no ball but DC knew CSK can’t do shit so they didn’t complain.,8
Sometimes I feel like celebrations can cause more injuries than a game.,2
Stoinis is quicker or as quick as CSK's fastest bowler playing this game.,2
Dhoni thinking to score 160 and defend now. CSK fans gonna miss him in 2028 IPL when then CSK captain whoever that be will go hard early and get bundled for 135. ❤️,0

Is nortje tired? He is not bowling that fast today.,2
Jadhav redemption time,2
 Unkill out. Sir Jadeja next,2
Fucking retire already. India has suffered enough,4

what is jadhav role in this squad lol,2
Can’t fault the approach here from Thala. At least didnt do a 15(20),5
"And then in finals Dhoni will hit a winning six - and all dumb fans will be like THALA THALA THALA, WE WON BECAUSE OF DHONI.",6
"160 will be challenging. We haven’t chased much, pitch seems death, and we give away a free wicket in Shaw upfront.",3
Rayudu with that sr is kinda sus. Check the logs!!,6

I am actually not happy that dhoni is out. Since the last 2 matches he has been coming in and been trying to hit and is actually hitting.,6
wow dhoni knew he couldn't waste balls so he got out. ultimate captains selfless sacrifice #respect,7
Never fails to amaze me how much of a team player MSD is. He sacrificed his wicket so that DC can win.,11
Batdeep has left the chat.,3
Why not jadhav? You cowards,7
Thanks MS! 160+ is on! Hope Jaddu hits!,2
MSD showing intent but not scoring! :(,2
Jesus the Dhoni hate is real lmao. Y'all do a good job of balancing out the fanboys.,8
Where's jadhau,1
I feel that was wide ball.,1
NRR padding match for us?,1
How do you think Jaddu is gonna fair against proper quicks?,2
"Dang funny to see how a fanbase turns against a guy.

Like yeah, it hasn't been his year but one fifty and y'all will be back to chanting Dhoni.",4
Where is Jadhav,3
4d chess by Dhoni to get himself out so Jadeja comes out and does actual hitting,9
[deleted],6
Lmao CSK fans blowing whistles in the middle of a pandemic.,8
160 at sharjah = bye bye playoff streak,2
Great performance by thala,4
I would take a Dhoni's 3(5) anyday over his Thala Special of 20(22).,12
"Dhoni isn't in any sort of form, but he definitely isn't playing tuktuk like everyone is accusing him of

Last couple of matches he's been going for the big shots within his first 10 balls and trying to score quickly, but hasn't been able to really get going",9
Thank god jadhav didn't come to bat,2
"Jadhav should really get to bat, else he wont be dropped next game lmao",10
Boy would it be great to beat CSK twice in this season,12
"If there is a mega auction before next season and Dhoni doesn't retire, do CSK retain him? Honest opinion Bois.",12
Wondering what is the role of Jadhav?,2
Nortje fooling batsmen with 135 kmph SLOWER balls lol lol,11
Imagine paying Dhoni 15 cr for this lmao,13
MSD getting out early so that he can do three more ads before the 2nd innings.,7
I seriously hope they send Bravo next and not Jadhav. Though I wonder why he’s in the team. If two quick wickets go down?,3
The dhoni hate on this sub is real,12

Rayudu you cheeky boi xx,2
Rayudu is a daddy,3
So Jadhav is in team just to make up the numbers? He ain't a bowler nor a fielder.,3
Jadhav is specialist place holder he doesn't do any of 3D things,3
Rayudu back to 2018 form,2
the fielder didn't even try to chase that LOL,1
I wish Rayadu had the career he promised early on in his career. Wasted talent,3
Genuine Q. Why didn't the fielder even reach for the ball? They just let it go?,2
shame that raydu didn't get many chances to play for india.,0
Rayudu doing good unfortunately against pace.,2
It doesn't feel like a DC match without Pant yelling behind the stumps,5
Watch out for Kedhar the finisher,2
Rayudu playing a gem.,3
Nortje's slower delivery is like the fastest bowl for Isuru Udana.  Absolute unit this man.,8
3d Rayudu,1
Jadhav being held back for the finish.,3
Dheni unkil is kil,9
Rayadu deserved to get selected for WC over 3D,2
"Bowl Rabada, don’t save him for the last over.",2
Rayudu playing really well today. Just needs to work on his running between the wickets.,2
"The fan in me wants MS to have a sparkling last season with the bat at CSK, I really do even as an MI supporter.

Just don't see it happening with his decline. Stranger things have happened in cricket of course but even so. What a sad fucking state of affairs.",14
Which player has reached the IPL final most number of time?  Brilliant question by Rohan G. Even gave the other commentators an over to think.,6
"Nortje with a slower 135, idhar pura runup leke pant me hagte hue bowlers 140 tak nahi pohochte lmao",9
Rayudu finally striking the ball with a good SR,4
Let's hope we win this match and stay at the top,3
Imagine having a T20 World Cup right now with de Kock Faf AB Morris Rabada & Nortje in the same team. 🔥🔥,8
Rayudu gotta stay till 20th,4
Feels bad can't even hate him anymore,2
Scenes if Rayudu becomes Man of the Match,3
Watson looks like just get me to the playoff bois somehow...after that...3 matches...you wouldnt even have to worry abt anything😳👉👈,3
"Why bowl Tushar?

Like seriously why?

They have to hit in both 18 and 20. But if you bowl Rabada now, you potentially take wickets and make it easier for the 20th over.

Dumb captaincy!!",-4
Its gotta be this over. We aren't going to do shit against Rabada and nortje,2
Dhoni cut older Indian team players for younger ones and now he has a team full of older players. The fuck is this hypocrisy.,27
Should Dhoni put another retirement announcement on his Insta from CSK. And which song should he choose this time?,4
I remember bravo being a decent finisher. Send him above jadhaw,3
Csk has experience? Thank you for notifying me,3
I demand Jadhav next 😅,3
"The role of jadhav in this lineup is to make Dhoni look better. 

CSK should kick his ass next year.",11
Who's in the dugout with Binga and Swann ?,1
If someone without any knowledge of Cricket read this sub they'd think Dhoni was a serial murderer or something.,11
What’s the par score here after the pitches have slowed down ?,0
Someone forgot to wipe stump camera,3
"Dhoni may be shit with the bat, but at least he can captain and keep.",6
Jadhav can't get dropped if he's never sent to bat. 5D move by Thala,6
"Dhoni should drop himself from the team, he's unable to make necessary decision at times because he's shit himself",1
What a shitty question from Rohan Gavaskar,1
imagine running singles in the deshpande over with rabada and nokia to come. state of csk.,5

"*member comments against Dhoni*

Fanbois' LoGic: Dhoni hater",7
"Unacademy super sixer, Rayudu is a serious contender for CRED power player of the match, sponsored by Lux cozi, powered by nissin noodles...",4
"Jadeja, you ain't here to do dhoni's task",2
Dhoni worse than Trump according to r/cricket,15
Nokia's slower ball is 135 meanwhile Unadkat bowling fast reaches the same speeds.,7
18th over - 4 singles in 4 balls. 😭,11
"Cork prepares a full book of notes on the past matches, Lee provides top-tier fast bowling analysis while Swann can’t understand a basic graphic on the screen. Great mix in the dugout here.",7
Bits-n-SIX,3
Jadeja just doesn't get it,1
This is just sad for us CSK fans. Seeing a once great team dying off.,2
I'll be miffed if DC doesn't win this,2
that's HUGE,1
Doully putting Rohan in his rightful place,1
It's gonna be a tight game if csk scores 160+,3
Live theft on TV fucking lmao,68
what a lucky guy lmao,21
Finally jadeja,2
Put his poster up for wanted to steal the ball,14
At least CSK didn't struggle to 130 against DC God bowling line up like many predicted,5
Lmao did he just💀💀,22
"They should keep fielder waiting in the building window as well, can get a nice catch from that",5
LOL THAT GUY JUST RUNNING OFF WITH THE BALL,85
Lol. People waiting outside the stadium for the balls.,34
"Police, camera, action ? Lmao",15
"79 m and out on the road, this ground is a joke",48
Ahhh classic LX 570 driving by while someone jaywalks,13
Did he just take the ball home?,37
The ultimate ball thief risking his life for the ball,33
170 please and it's our game,3
IPL day 28 but Dhoni's Khathabook ad still remains his best performance this season.,11
"Whichever country it be, every boys will run after stray balls.",24
I don't think we can score more than 15 in the next 2 overs of Notje and Rabada.,6
"Hits the Altroz, dents the ball 😂😂😂",34
Call the police,19
"To be honest, I would have done that too.",31
lmao at the ball stealer,25
"Hello 911, I just witnessed a robbery",71
Good move to send in jadeja instead of Jadhav,3
Lol. Freeeeee ballll,11
Ye Akash Chopra kitna gyan chodta hain,1
"Ravindra na raj ma, CSK majama.",8
Not bad over for DC,1
"Dhoni has INTENT, and the value of INTENT is equal to 50 runs from 25 balls, so his actual Koach^(TM) Score^(TM) is 53 runs from 30 balls.

STOP HATING PLEBS",2
"Every other team: DC pacers too scary omg nooooo

CSK: Imma hit boundaries off of you and only boundaries, no singles or doubles or any other runs for the rest of the over.",7
"Rayudu pushing for 2, is this 2020?",4
"You can get out of India, but India doesn't get out of you.",10
Under Par score coming up,0
They're talking about Frogger in the Dugout. Worlds are surely colliding!,2
Swann is so entertaining,2
"He did the right thing by taking the ball from the road. 

It could had caused an accident as Tyres can slip on the ball.",6
Indian guys hanging outside the ground waiting for a rogue ball in the middle of a pandemic is peak Indian behavior.,17
Whats the punishment in uae for stealing a ball,3
commentary took a dark turn,1
[deleted],9
[removed],-1
I thought stadium staff were there to throw back in for the balls gone out of stadium,2
Lmao that guy,5
Wow!! Csk running 2s!! Boys really want to win this one!,3
So it's another ball or did he return it?,1
[deleted],1
tbh dhoni getting out is a blessing for csk. atleast these two can run.,3
That guy is gonna get away with that ball,3
If you're Gonna send your all rounder ahead of your batsman what's the point of having that batsman.,11
I hope they put Swanny on a retainer for Dugout. Madlad shitposting IRL for a job. Respect.,13
"It's difficult for a franchise when a player like Dhoni doesn't perform, can't replace him as he has been the face of the Team for so long but also the future is also very uncertain with him.

Stuck in a limbo waiting for his retirement.",3
"Match at Sharjah

Random people waiting outside the stadium: stonks",16
"Alright champs, who’s coming with me to cubbon park when RCB play at Chinnaswamy?",2
Why do I feel this is a 190-200 wicket and we just fucked up.,2
People out there on the roads gonna get hurt trying to retrieve those balls.,4
Would they use the ball if tha ball is thrown back inside though?,3
Hmmm.. I know that modern cricket is making pictches like roads but didn't expect to see actual roads.,7
Wait there's another ground just by the Sharjah ground?,2
Why are csk fans thinking they will win the game if they score 170. Lmaoo,3
Poor people can't even take balls now lmao,2
"You are not allowed to cross roads in Shj(fineabale) other than on zebra, the cameraman has done him no favours there,though I guess the ball may pay for it.",8
Wtf Tushar? You couldn't gather the ball properly? It would've been close,2
"Come on DC, get one more wicket please. I wanna see the lord Jadhav show his skills",2
It feels like there is a boundary every other ball but the runs don’t show it,4
Swanny provides great mix in the dugout with his humour,4
Chennai Senile Kings,3
"CSK have batted well today for a change this season.
Delhi will have to bat extremely well to chase this. The last few games with Pant and Hetmeyer being out Delhi haven't been there with the bat.",1
Rayudu wiped by running a 2,4
Imagine waiting out there for the ball but it's Dhoni and Jadhav batting...,19
Raina leaving like that really cost this team,11
Both batsmen with SR>180 wtf,1
Plot twist: That guy was employed to collect the balls and return to the stadium.,7
"Genuine Q, when they showed the sky view of the place, where exactly was the camera positioned to get such a view?",6
Imagine if a wicket falls and Jadhav shows up,6
"same sort of ball wasn't call wide in RR/RCB match, I remember. why double standards",1
Y’all out here criticizing the boy as if you wouldn’t take the ball if given the opportunity,7
Dhoni sacrificing himself like krillin for Super Saiyan Rayudu.,5
"Honestly batting has been great, the first 4-5 overs were just too slow.",3
Umpiring has been shocking today,9
">The bowlers are ready the fielders are ready, but Rayudu is waiting for a drink. No wonder CSK matches don't finish on time. Might as well ask for a massage while at it

Cricinfo got no chill",76
Rayudu coming down the pitch to Rabada and Nortje,6
"CSK batting reminds me of my Hero Puch in teenage years.

Only 2 gears, first and second.",12
The fuck is this umpiring.,11
Doesn't CSK have any domestic player to play instead of Jadhav? They are just wasting a spot if he isn't gonna bowl or bat,16
Archer ahead Rabada? Is it because of those lucky sixes?,11
[deleted],90
How much does a white cricket ball cost?,2
Rayuduuuuu,4
"Tell you what, this is a good launch pad for last 2 overs. If CSK capitalize here, they can get to a really good total.

Won't be easy vs KG and Nortje though. CSK badly need finishers.",3
HOW IS THAT ALLOWED TO GO FOR A SIX. ITNA CHOTA STADIUM MC,1
Get Kedar to bowl today. Should be fun,1
Chennai should play with 10 players in the team and reserve a golden seat for lord jadhav,7
Rayudu 😳,5
He hit that so casually lmao,2
I wish Jadhav drops a crucial catch today that will be so funny,3
Rayudu and Robbie today. Damn,7
Lord Rabada,3
"Do super over wickets count towards that count? I know they don't in purple cap, and it's fair, but rabada is extraordinary in super overs",3
"My god Rayudu, who gave you an earful? What a shot 👌",3
Ambati batting in 4d mode,2
Kedar Jadhav be like : I helped!,1
BIG SHOW in the CSK camp 🤣,0
Vijay Shankar spoke to Rayudu before the match,4
Rayudu must have taken tips from Samson for Sharjah,2
Sharjah and Chinnaswamy are perfect grounds for Rayudu.,2
4D Rayadu > 3D Shankar. Dont @ me.,6
"I'm donating my left kidney if Rayudu finishes with 200> SR

Edit : My kidney lives to see another day",7
I know I'm being greedy but 175 please CSK.,9
"Say fuck MSK, Everytime rayadu performs better than Shankar",8
Surprised the cheat at square leg didn’t call that a wide,10
"Took me one and a half hour to realise this game is in sharjah, until the dude sneaked thay ball away from road",9
Rabada be like - Ab yeh maar bhenchod,13
Rabada is slick,3
Who is this and where is Rayudu?,5
man jadeja runs like a gazelle,3
Rabada has already reserved the purple cap for the season,5
Fuck the umpires though.,3
"ooh, Rayudu didnt ask for a No-ball? Why??",8
Gota love how Rayudu goes from comically inept to aggressively awesome in one game!,17
He keeps coming down the pitch for Rabada and it's yet to work for him.,4
"If we are anywhere close to having a chance here, it's mostly because of raydu.",9
Wicket please ... Jadhav needs to show he is shit bor he will play the next match,2
Jaddu flies,3
Do something cheeky jaddu,5
"What ever CSK makes, they will be 30 short.",3
Will we ever see another Helicopter Shot from Dhoni in the IPL?,4
Try running like that against ethical mind,7
This CSK team would have been a really quality side with Raina,17
Woah Jadeja,6
Jaddu *slurp *slurp *slurp *slurp,4
SIXXXXX,1
Yeah winning against CSK is overrated anyway.,4
Hatt bc,1
"Genuine Q. If you're walking by the ground and ball gets struck out the ground and lands by your feet, what should you actually do with it?",5
Where are all the trolls who said CSK can't touch Rabada and Nortje lol??,15
Jadeja batting on 6d,3
A rare mistake from Rabada.,3
SIR,3
Rabadda getting hit. Wow.,3
Csk mecha uncle has upgraded himself with 2 extra flags,5
Good comeback by csk,4
I am expecting a sensational inning by Shaw in second inning,5
Well we have to bat better than we have batted in last few matches. Going to be a monumental task,4
How were these mofos so poor chasing in the early matches. Great batting from both today and the real victory is not having Jadhav come in to bat,1
Hotstar ad guy is OOTL with KKR captaincy change,2
"Why are people bashin Jadhav?  
He is in the team for his sharp fielding.",1
ALWAYS GOT TIME FOR JADDU DADDY,1
Is there actually a chance for 175?,1
Even CSK players are afraid of Jadhav coming on no wonder they are playing so well,6
"Hahahaha... Cops actually pay for any services they use? This might sound crazy, but I've never seen a cop give someone money, I've only seen them take it from people.",1
DC is done for this game.,2
"Get out, one of you guys. I want to see Lord Boss Jadhav bat for 5 balls atleast...",1
Ok bois...we just need our tactical dhoni to do his 2013 magic of defending today now...,3
"CSK: Imma bat cautiously against Sandeep, Unadkat, Kaul and Khaleel

Also CSK: Imma hit sixes every over off of Nortje and Rabada",3
I’m so glad we didn’t see jadhav today..,1
You know you're in Sharjah when someone scores 16 off Rabada (last ball was shit though),3
My man Kedar is just playing for some fielding practice today lol,4
below 180 hasn't been defended in sharjah this ipl.,2
180 please,0
How many balls does the umpires keeps in reserve,3
"Gonna be a hard chase, slight advantage to CSK I think",2
Jadeja is playing some good cameos this IPL,2
I'm happy. This aint our year but atleast they have the intent. Glad to see this.,1
"1-33 very decent figures at Sharjah, even considering one over was a maiden. Our bowling lineup always gives us a chance",5
Kedhar Jadhav is our Specialist fielder this match guyssss,5
"This is a good batting track.Isn't it?
(cries in 40 run PP)",5
30 run last over letzooooo,1
Wtf I like Graeme Swann now,3
This score can win kidneys and hearts but still 20 runs short atleast,2
So glad to have fielding extraordinaire Jadhav in the team.,6
Is Sharjah back to how it was in the beginning or are we just bowling shit?,0
That's wide in CSK book,1
Swing baby swing...the pace will simply carry it out of the ground,1
Kannum Kannum Nortje,6
Jaddu trying to do a thala there,2
Not a bad place to be in the 19th over. 2 batsmen who can go big,2
Yeh bhi wide chaiye madarchod?,0
Delhi need to chase this like Mumbai did yesterday.,3
What the fuck is this match even,4
Fuck sake I have Jadhav in my Dream11. Hope he takes a catch or some shit,2
"lol how fickle is r/cricket, from csk is hopeless to DC is hopeless in two boundaries lmao.",12
DC looks like they've given up.,4
Jaddu the next thala?,2
Jaddu you sexy mother-lover🎶,8
"DC bowling failing against CSK batting

2020",10
These full tosses are unforgivable,2
jaddu is playing the role of power hitter very well.,15
Jadeja you beauty,13
Csk should send jadeja ahead of MS,8
Too many attempted yorkers turning into juicy full-tosses,3
Why are commentators saying 185 is a very good score. The avg score in sharjah is around 200,-2
Ya those 2 full tosses are going to come back to hurt DC,4
"Whoever has been following tamil commentry would know this.. but for others, each ball costs 15k inr.. in the first csk vs rr match 33 sixes rained.. think how many balls were replaced and how much it would have costed!",6
JADDDUUUUUU,2
Yes jadeja tonk it,3
Fuck yeah Jaddu,5
Well it had to happen. An off night for our bowlers,3
fuck we are lost :(,8
Competition between Dhoni and Jadhav now of who becomes a tailender first,0
FUCKING I N T E N T,5
"Oh jaddu, my jaddu",1
"Shit, jadeja is lethal",3
This is definitely better than what we expected at the 14 over mark. We might have a good chance today,5
Jadeja has been a mini-Raina for us this season.,7
Rabad and Nortje got wrecked by Sir tonight lol,8
feed him more fullies,2
Jadeja you beautyyy,6
JADDUUUUUU,6
All hail Sir Jadeja ....,6
My god Jadeja 👏👏👏 This is what I wanted to see. Nokia getting hit.,8
Youw Jadeja nalla kalakkirange,8
What's the par score?,2
CSK treating DC bowlers like they're your local 50 kmph pacer,12
Jadeja needs a fucking upgrade in batting order. He has the highest strike rate in CSK this season.,30
Jadeja > MSD + Jadhav + many other so called finishers,9
Damn jadduu,10
Fucking hell jadeja,17
FUCKING MAGICIAN JADDU BOY,10
can't beleiev we reached 180 from maidan over!,18
"Ravindra""Viv Richards""Jadeja",14
Jaddu the real MVP,6
Jaddu the real MVP,5
Fuck yeah,3
Jadeja you motherfucker,3
Has the real csk arrived? I'm scared to hope!,15
Now this is more like the CSK I remember.,15
180 is over par -scoty Styris,5
[deleted],2
"Sir Jadeja, The Finisher for CSK!",6
Bret Lee just said Nortje didn't clocked 150 kph today cause of different speed gun. Well he should know his most fastest deliveries were clocked in Australia and it's own home broadcast 😭😂,12
Make Jadeja CSK captain motherfuckersss,10
I remember hating Jadeja for getting Pandya run out in the finals vs Pakistan,10
Jaddu is still the best Indian spin bowling allrounder currently,26
Dicks out for Jaddu,12
Would love to see Jaddu‘s sword celebration!,6
Daddy Jaddu,4
imagine jadhav coming instead of jaddu and tuk tuking his way to a score of 148 lmao.,12
"Alex Carey might finally have to bat today, can he :/",3
What is happening over here. This is a a par score.,5
"For once, good decision by the management to send Jedeja. They could've won more matches if they did that before",8
That Jaddu cameo has made me horny af.,17
CSK roaring back to life to mug off r/cricket.,14
"Ok, I’d back Jaddu to win like ABd did today in the death",6
"Jadeja be like ""tewatia kya aagya Rajput ko bhuul gaye""",8
Bounced back,5
Jadeja batting went two levels up in the last couple of years in both tests and white ball cricket.,16
10 runs below par,-1
179 lessgo,3
180 target here is a good score! Know it is Sharjah but gives you a chance on this pitch!,5
Sir Jadeja giving DC a chance,-1
"I hope Shardul doesn't go for 50 runs today. Man's been in good form, if he has a bad game, he'll lose confidence",6
Jadeja smashing Rabada at death. You all rounder could never.,8
Perfect batting from CSK today tbh,7
180 to win is WAY too much on this slow ass pitch and even slower ass batsmen. GG Jaddu.,12
65 million years. Zap,0
"on par score, though a bit of an edge towards DC",2
CSK were 56-1 at 9 overs.,7
Fuck yeah. RCB still has the lowest first innings score here.,9
why dont they simply go for 2 runs off the last ball,1
Jadeja is a better batsman than Dhoni rn,10
"180 is very chasable on this pitch, if one of shaw, dhawan, stoinis or iyer play a good innings today we should win",4
"180 to win, now bowl like mothafuckas CSK.",2
The way DC death bowling got fucked makes me believe 180 is below par,7
[deleted],-12
Don't see dc chasing this without pant and hetmyer,1
180 target gives a psychological advantage.,3
"Nice finish to the innings, hope csk do well in the bowling department",1
"180 is insane considering they had a maiden over in the powerplay, lost both the openers, Watson and Dhoni.",8
What even is the logic behind playing Jadeja so late. He should be batting in the top 4 for CSK.,5
This 2 showed it is 200+ score pitch,2
**Fuck**,3
This ground is broken so can’t blame any bowlers here.,3
CSK need to do God’s work and win today,1
There goes the Delhi confidence in death overs at crucial stage of IPL.,1
Sir Jadeja has been the best batsman for CSK this season after Faf,3
"Lord Tewatia vs Sir Jadeja

Who would survive?",2
CSK showing what's possible if Dhoni and Jadhav don't play!,7
"RAVINDRA JADEJA, OH DEAR OH GOD G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S",3
"This is hardly worst case, fellow DC fans. If they can do that to our death bowling, we have more than a shot. We gotta have faith, even if the daredevils years have made it hard",8
They did well to get to 180 to be honest after that slow start,1
Aren't people listening to the commentary? 180 will be a challenge to chase on this pitch.,10
Lmao smashing KG and Nokia left and right. Is this CSK?,9
Guys its sharjah. Relax,4
Ravindra e dudhpak saro khadho lage che,2
Chill jaddu. We get the message - Death bowling blown to bits and pieces.,6
Shaw needs to not throw his wicket away today if we want a chance.,2
Need 2018/2019 Chahar and 2020 Shardul to come good,6
DC has very strong batsmen we have to hope Rahane plays a lot of balls for us to win here,2
If they get Dhawan cheap match is CSKs,3
[deleted],11
[removed],4
Congrats RCB for getting into top 2,3
I reckon CSK are a solid 10 runs short.,1
CSK just thrashed our bowling lineup,11
dont think csk can defend this. 15 runs short imo.,0
Love watching Jadeja bat and field,10
The question is if DC can chase down 179,2
Is that a football they threw on the ground?,3
"If shaw fails today... Forget about playing IX DC should lock him up and throw away the keys. Can't field for shit, throws away his wicket, ofc can't bowl.

Edit: And my boi shaw not disappointing anyone here! Ffs drop him already",7
"Target of 180 is not bad at all, Dhoni could defend it, if he could pull a 2013 match out tonight.",9
Is it below par or defendable ?,4
Classic t20 batting this after 2-1 from 2 overs. Didn’t lose their cool and played their natural game,8
33(13) is Jaddu's best cameo this season yet,14
Jadeja needs to bat higher! CSK is missing a trick with him. Move Curran back to finisher role and Jadeja at #4 after Rayudu.,10
Dhoni has basically become Badrinath of the CSK line up from 2010s,9
"CSK's batting has significantly improved in the last few games. Exceptions are there, obviously.",11
Damn. CSK were 56-1 at the end of 9 overs. Good recovery but still the advantage is with DC.,6
"Thank fucking god Dhoni got out 5 balls, best thing for CSK today!!!",16
"Jadeja is a different player from the bits and pieces comment last year.

He must magine the every ball as Manjrekar's face to hit it like this.",34
Jaddu👏🏽👏🏽,2
"Being quick isn't enough if you keep missing your length. Also Jadeja really needs to come in ahead of Dhoni, far more reliable.",1
Man didn’t think they’d set a target of 180 tbh,3
Why is even dhoni playing? He should not only step down from his captaincy but from CSK as well.,-10
This would have been an easy target to chase down if DC had Hetmeyer and Pant,3
Jaddu‘s batting will be an asset in the upcoming Australia series!,5
Jaddu opener in next match lmao,5
We're fucking wasting Jaddu's batting skills. He should come before Dhoni.,4
"From a maiden over in the second to nearing 180...

This is going to be hard as fuck to chase",5
Why is Jadjea shaking his hips?,3
Jadeja's voice does not match his face at all lol,26
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
"Jaddu and Raydu played well in end as hitting even full tosses for six isn't easy but WTH were those juicy half volleys and full tosses?

Rabada and Nortje have bowled so well in tournament that our expectations are sky high.",6
This thread really goes silent when CSK plays good.,36
Jadeja dancing😆,2
Best strategy for CSK is don’t take Dhawan and Rahane wickets . Just let them bat as long as they wish .,8
"good total, have to bowl really well... we got this bois",4
"Thank goodness thala got out early,  credit of 180 goes to him",4
15 runs short.,3
"Top players for CSK today. 
4. Faf
3. Jadeja
2. Rayudu
1. Umpires",-6
180 is more than enough for Dhoni to defend. Especially against the inexperienced batting of DC. This will be an interesting watch,11
We lost the plot there in the last 5 overs. Way too many length / full balls for Sharjah,6
Aight so. I think we batted very well. Had curran clicked(got unlucky) we would have been far away from 200. Didn't waste balls and had a boundary everyover. Rayudu and jadeja were clinical.,8
"Come on dc, let us go this one time. Promise we won't win the league",2
Greatest mistake by DC today is getting the wicket of Thala. They faced the consequences of it in the last 2 overs.,55
Good recovery from CSK. One thing you can't take away from Dhoni is that he won't panic while defending a competitive total. Hoping for a tight finish in the 2nd innings.,20
A lot depends on Shardul today,10
CSK fans right now : Feels just like home!,2
"No Jadhav and some good entertainment at death. 

I consider this a win-win situation.",8
"CSK played 41dot balls till 18th over, that's a lot, like real fucking high.


Edit:    42 dot balls in 20 overs, crickbuzz. 

[27 dot balls in first 10 overs!!!](https://i.imgur.com/nCRteoC.jpg)",20
CSK fans right now : Feels just like home!,9
67 runs came in the last 4 overs,9
Jaddu has a big dick sword,6
"Come to think of it, you don't really see Jadeja giving interviews do you?",3
imagine they sent Jadhav ahead of Jadeja😰,5
Axar with MVP bowling figures,1
Jadhav's best innings of the tournament so far,21
"I keep forgetting that Jadeja was an integral part of Kohli's U19 team, I feel being in CSK makes him appear older than he is",47
Csk fanbois gonna rain memes today,2
Thankfully Jadhav didn't come ahead of Jaddu,8
"Imagine if jadeja came in place of Dhoni, csk could have reached 190+",4
Jadeja the Next Dhoni for CSK,11
"Expecting Shaw special here, 70+",0
Gosh Jaddu what is that strike rate! Good finish from CSK. Sucks that we bowled a couple of full tosses in the death.,8
"ok Guys, we can start now i think - CSK Vs MI finals?!",9
Kumar Sangakkara and Neroli Meadows👍🏽🙌🏽👏🏽,-1
DC were 1 wicket away from bringing Kedar Jadhav to the crease and restricting CSK to 160,11
when faf & sir rekt Nortje's figures to make him look like unadkat,22
"Finally Some Intent from CSK, Bravo can bat good as well",5
Pushing Jadhav before Jadeja could have provided more entertainment in this thread...,17
"Manjraker on cricinfo yesterday: ""Jadeja isn't primarily a t20 player.""

33*(13) yeah talk nah",38
"Shaw, Dhawan, Rahane, and Iyer need to get 30 runs each to build a decent platform for us so Carey and Stoinis can finish up. Gonna be real tough though.",9
I think r/cricket should have a CSK apology thread if they manage to qualify this year,37
CSK lost 10-15 runs in the PP. It's going to really cost them today,2
"Jadeja needs to be back in the Indian T20  team instead of Kuldeep 

Rohit 

Rahul

Kohli

Iyer

Pant 

Pandya

Jadeja 

D Chahar / Bhuvi 

Saini / Natarajan 

Chahal

Bumrah

With Suryakumar Yadav and Sundar as back up players for the T20 world cup",16
CSK don't stand a chance to defend this without Ngidi/Tahir,-4
180 against the best bowling lineup in the tournament? I'd take it any day with our batting form.,24
Isn’t Neroli Meadows 38?,-1
The pitch is not that sticky but 180 is not an undefendable score either. Will be an interesting chase.,6
"I swear if our batters dont save our bowlers today, all the batters should get tatted *Nokia is Rad, Rabada is Dad*",12
I dont remember Jadeja batting this good consistently,8
Average score in the last 7 innings in Sharjah: 164.,8
Nice move by CSK by picking Jadhav. MSD is happy. They play slow at top to make sure Jadhav doesn't get to bat. Fans are happy. Win win situation :),6
Miss Meadows has a wonderful pair of legs on her,-10
Jadeja has been really good with the bat this season,5
Nortje should have sacrificed a wicket to get his team 15-20 less target,7
Best innings from Jadhav this season,9
**CSK vs MI** Finals Confirmed if CSK win,9
"If any other team would have done this against rabada and nortje, this sub would have exploded. But since its csk, they blame it on the ground.",11
"Tbh given their batting form, CSK over achieved after that abysmal PP. Par score at best for this smol ground. Hope they bowl well and take 4 wickets in the PP.",-3
"CSK scored 95 runs in last 9 overs, with 9 wickets in hand. Not so good in this small ground",1
"Come on DC you've got this! Hope Shaw, Dhawan, Iyer, Rahane, Carey all fire tonight. Especially missing my West Indian boi in Hetmyer. Pant, could you please recover quickly so my boi could get back in the squad.",5
[deleted],-7
"CSK's bowlers are at clear disadvantage with shorter boundaries.

At least Rabada had the pace to bowl dots early on.",7
Has 180 or higher been chased successfully this IPL?,2
Thread now can't make fun of csk as they did ok now going for dhoni wicket is good,3
So Kedar Jadhav didn't get to bat. A specialist fielder for CSK.,11
[removed],-7
I remember Sanga had a British accent. What happened to that lol?,4
CSK need to get Shaw out early and bring in Rahane to cause run rate pressure,5
[removed],3
"So after bits and pieces debacle, manju decides to say that jaddu isn't a good T20 player. Lmao manju my man pipe down already or you'll become the next reverse nostradamus",6
r/Cricket is in confusion rn cause they don't have a legitimate reason to hate on anybody in this match,12
Off topic :- who was that didi in the stands during rcb vs rr match?,7
so should I be hopeful or not,2
Kefhar gonna open bowling,1
Make a seperate simp thread for Neroli Meadows it's unbearable,10
Why does the crickmatchbot have an Rcb flair?,12
this might be the first season dhoni would not score even a single fifty,7
Anyone miss Mayanti Langer these days?,8
65 million years. Zap,1
"Surely someone like Deepak Chahar should be looking to play as much first-class cricket as he can and break into the Test side because his bowling relies a lot on the ball swinging which is sort of like Bhuvi but he's a little less accurate but nonetheless the red ball would swing much longer than the white one and he can be really effective there. Also given Bhuvi is so fragile, he can be a backup swing bowler for the red ball side.",11
"Man T20 cricket is so unpredictable. If I had to play fantasy league today, I would've never picked Jadeja as he is not consistent but today he was marvelous. Most people would've picked Curran and he got a duck. T20 especially IPL is just too unpredictable.",8
The biggest crime that the Thala can commit is not a murder or match fixing. It is actually taking Jadhav in playing 11.,20
How did Babar Azam not get picked up in the auction?,-4
"I got an accounting HW due tomorrow, and now I have hopes. Damn it!",3
"You only need to get a hattrick maiden Chahar, you can do it lad!",6
Lol the tamil commentator saying we can expect 3 wickets from Bravo today. What fantasy world do these people live in? First few matches they were really critical of the team. Looks like management has made them toe the line,11
"Who was the other gentleman in the dugout during CSK last few overs? Swann, Lee,....?",2
ABD doing wonders at 36 yrs of age and Dhoni doing well till 37th tells you players should retire before 38 even in IPL. Virat has 5 yrs of pure energy to entertain ❤️,8
Maybe Prithvi's jersey number is 100 because 'sau' is a pun on Shaw? (Sau = 100),3
Shaw against Chahal looks like a disaster waiting to happen.,1
Let's just see if DC can chase the total down,1
Dhoni teaching a proper lesson to Jadhav first drops him for Chawla who hardly bowls and now Jadeja going ahead of him.,3
What happened to DC's kit with the rainbow colours?,5
[deleted],41
So is it CSK vs KKR for the 4th spot if CSK manage an upset today?,9
GOTHIMMMMMMMMMM,6
Gone for a duck,6
gg,3
"GONEEE, CHAHAR YOU BEAUTY",7
PP watch: Big PP or small PP today?,2
Wtf was that from Shaw?,6
"Wait, I missed that wicket. What happened.?",2
"3 ducks lmao

Press F",5
LETS GO,1
Fuck hes fuck yes fuck yes,4
Fucking hell 2 ducks in a row,6
Both teams had opener duck out. Amazing,8
Dc collapse incoming 😆🤪,1
WTF  🌍!,2
Shaw is proper lauda lassan,6
Throw this guy out of team,3
"Abbe yaar yeh shaw ka kya kare, isse hata bhi nahi sakte, aur rakhe toh yeh aisa karta hai",5
Chahar you beauty,4
"Free wicket at the top!

Anyone else wants to comment anything?",5
I just love cotton balls always nice to watch,3
DEEPAK I LOVE YOU,2
Shaw has hit a rough patch,3
Both teams having almost the same start,2
Bro just give shikhar first ball,7
Csk csk,5
"man down, we got a man down",2
Lmao,3
Tit for Tat,4
"Dread it, run from it, prithvi ""first over out"" Shaw still arrives",8
"Hint of swing and Shaw gets out next ball, don't select this guy in Indian team for another two years atleast",7
Both team openers have been very kind to each other.,3
Thats exactly how i got out in a street match. Never defend a fast bowler like that,7
Fraudvi,2
"Shaw man. Unless he does something about his footwork, gets more practice and comes back, I don't see him as a regular.",3
"**0.2** Chahar to Shaw, OUT, Chahar has got him five times out of six. That is an ordinary shot. Outswinger just outside off, and he is looking to flick this to leg. The leading edge settles with Chahar. A second duck for Shaw **0-1**

PP Shaw c &amp; b Chahar 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",3
"I always had this one question 


Why do cameramen always focus on beautiful gals? Why not handsome boys in the audience? Where's equality?",3
"Lol, platinjum to regular duck, there is some improvement I think.",2
That's an interesting start bc.,2
Bhenchod MRF ka bat use karne se Sachin nhi ban jayega,5
Still can't believe this guy is our test opener,4
Prithivi Shaw needs to get Cough syrup back on menu,3
*NEXT SACHIN*,2
"Shaw 🤝 Curran

Child’s play duck out club",4
One thing I have picked up both Shaw & Gill are vulnerable to pitched up deliveries.,1
Sachin Imposter,2
And then you guys say IPL is not fixed. /s,0
Haha CSK showing they only need 2 balls for their first wicket,1
Shaw paying back Curran's wicket,4
"Look drop Shaw, he is absolute liability. And that is not even talking about his fielding.",6
"*Lagta hain aaj 2 bottle corex chadha ke nahi aaya*

T: Looks like he didn't have his dosage of cough syrup.",3
No Hetmeyer is will cost Deli this game. Smh.,0
Shaw is the next ~~Sachin~~ Unmukt Chand,4
Shithvi Shaw,2
"CSK lost their first  wicket on the third ball, DC on the second. DC to win with one ball to spare.",3
Prithvi Shaw looks stupid whenever ball swings,3
I'm backing Rahane to strike at 150 today,1
Lmao people here went from saying Shaw would alone chase down the entire score to praising CSK to shitting on Shaw in 30 mins.,8
He looked like a nervous wreck,2
Nice of DC to also sacrifice their young.,2
"Iyer better fucking bring out his aggressive side today. Ain't no way Delhi are chasing 180 otherwise. Stoinis will have to play a blinder, AGAIN. Too much to ask.",1
So all his talent was based on cough syrup? /s,5
ball in nipping,1
Ouch for Shaw. He needs to work on his game to go to next level. It was easy for him so far and with his high profile made it to Indian team as well. But need persistence to get to next level.,1
Shitvi Shaw😆,3
[deleted],1
Next match make rahane open with dhawan and pant and Hetmyer back... Shaw is a walking wicket,3
"I believe in superstition, Prithvi was out on 0 last game and we won that 😅",3
The shaw show is shut,2
[deleted],3
Shaw making Chahar looking good.,1
Shaw returning the favour for curran's duck,6
*NeXt TeDuLKar* lmao **Mumbai Lobby**,9
Shaw looks clueless even when he scores to be honest. I have never been convinced by him.,1
Keep both rahane and dhawan at the crease for a long time,1
important partnership for csk,1
Can raina come back to csk after this season? I heard his contract got axed,1
At this point it's worth dropping Shaw just to show him he can't take his place for granted.,2
Prithvi *Unmukt Chand* Shaw,5
I somehow have this feeling that DC will botch up this chase. No power hitters except stoinis will be tough tonight.,0
Chahar the ball bender.. our promised avatar,6
Did Shaw play in tests in NZ? How did he fare there?,1
So far so good,1
"Everyone during CSK's inning : Prithvi will finish the game in 15 overs. 


Now : Pikachu face",3
"wtf does the commentator mean by prithvi shaw is very ""handsy""",1
Guys WTF? Just tuned in.,1
"We will take that duck, Shaw. Thanks",4
Tocha boi is out of steroids it seems.,2
*Sachin got out on 2nd ball WTF*,7
@DC fans will you prefer Rahane over Shaw as opener? Why or why not?,1
Prithvi Rickshaw fails to start again.,3
Shaw always has that awkward jerky movement just before he faces the ball. Not sure anyone noticed that but that has seen to give him problems every now & then,1
Dhawan will probs run himself out today mark my words,2
"If you give a teenager crores of rupees, there is no motivation left.",3
Perfect start for CSK,2
Wicket Maiden,3
"**Prithvi Shaw vs Deepak Chahar**

Six innings

39 balls

38 runs

Five dismissals (all in Powerplay)",5
"Deepak Chahar has been PP god since 2018, dude should be in the test squad",4
Why so much hate on Shaw? He's improving. The other day he lasted just 1 ball,12
Wicket maiden. We're all equal now.,8
"MI,DC,RCB,CSK to Playoffs.",12
That's for Sam Curran chellakutty😂,9
"Wicket maiden , very rare in t20",10
This guy is absolutely fucking worthless. Can’t even perform with steroids.,10
did jadhav touched his ass?,6
Rahane and the art of strike rotation,3
Holy shit where was that guy that asked for a wicket maiden?,6
Prithvi Shaw is giving me Chand vibes here,9
How the turntables,4
Fuck I love watching Chahar bowl with the new seed. Nothing better than classical outswing bowling to the right hander.,12
Did he just slap Chahar's ass?,10
Great over from Chahar,4
Maiden wicket over sexy Cherry,6
DC needed two overs to get a wicket and a maiden.. CSK doing it in one,4
Should have let Jadhav play atleast one ball to scapegoat him if csk loses,1
"First Dhoni, now Shaw receiving shit.",3
Shaw is Chahar's bunny.,7
I bet my brother that Shaw will be out to Chahar in this first over. Anyone wants to know the best stocks to pick?,7
Wicket maiden - DC taking a leaf out of CSK's innings,5
so no mention of the wicket maiden over? people were screaming when rabada got a maiden,13
[deleted],9
"DC : Maiden

CSK : Here's our Wicket Maiden",17
I'd like to see Punter bench Shaw. There's no way he'd find a kid with that kind of batting or fielding acceptable.,5
Chahar has been unreal in PPs since he came on to the scene. Not as good in the death overs but makes up for it with early wickets 8/10 times.,11
[deleted],12
"I think we should drop Shaw. Guys a walking wicket these days. Can't play against the moving ball. Bhuvi, Boult, Jofra, Chahar all had his number. Ffs",4
It's so good to hear Sanga's analysis,4
Get ready for another CSK vs MI final bois never gets old haha.,4
"But but he is next sachin! How dare you insult him!!

/s",14
We have been winning despite our fielding and Shaw at the top lol.,1
Shaw probably couldn't get his hands on some cough syrup because of the bubble rules.,4
ShAw iS ThE NeXt TenDulKar,4
What an amazing over from Chahar.,3
Pretty boy with the ball.,5
Chotu now to bowl. We used to give younger players in our team opening batting & bowling to encourage them. CSK doing exactly that :),5
shawts fired,7
"Prithvi Shaw always struggles against any decent movement . Even in the last game against CSK he was that he edged behind but no one noticed .

Gives you zero confidence him being out test team opener for overseas series",6
Virgin Rabada maiden vs Chad Chahar wicket maiden,16
This is terrible even for a test match start.,6
DC trying to outdo CSK's batting shithousery in the PP,8
The only thing I like about Shaw is that he does not waste balls lol.,14
"Sam here against Rahane would be a really good match up. He can move the ball and if he moves it back in to Rahane from over the wicket, it'll be really difficult to face.",3
Deepak Chahar is the best swing bowler in India right now. Gets banana swing both ways. For next England tour he has to be considered,5
"Chahar is doing more for us then what we pay him for, however on an another note this pitch makes swing bowlers seem like wasim lol.",0
"**Prithvi Shaw's last 3 matches**

4, 0, 0",8
Fielding setup looks weird,1
"When people said Shaw is next Tendulkar, I really believed that shit.",6
Shaw my boy. You just gave your place to Rahane.,8
I have a bad feeling DC will mirror CSK's innings,5
"I cant believe there is no rajasthani in rr , whereas there are rajasthanis in Csk,Mi and Srh",4
Sam Curran looks like a park level seamer. How the fuck is he playing on this stage?,1
Shaw and Ponting cant be seen. What i think is that a door has been locked and fill in the blanks,8
"Shaw, Samson and Maxwell have got to be the most overrated IPL players",6
"If they handle stoinis well, csk might pull this off",1
Not surprised... it’s tough being a dc fan,1
Why Dhawan lets that loser take first strike in every single game is beyond me,2
I'm like an over late? Is Shaw already gone??? Dammit Shaw,3
"Rabada 1st over - maiden.

Chahar 1st over - wicket maiden.

Chahar > Rabada.",5
"Pitch it up boy, horrible ball.",1
"To recap:

Top 3 is useless, Shreyas is tuk tuk, Pant is injured, Stoinis is only a pinch hitter, Carey exists, and Ashwin is inconsistent.",1
Will Dhoni explain why he's picking Jadhav over Jagadesan when Jadeja is doing most of the finishing?,8
feels like rahane gonna go big today,2
Play like CSK to win against CSK... I guess..,2
Oh how the turn tables,1
Curran always gives a lot of boundary balls. Needs to work on his consistency,4
Goddammit Curran,2
We would explode if Jadhav comes into bowl the next over.,-1
This is not the Dhawan i know,4
"Dhawan is in red hot form, no jinx",2
Shikha is in some good touch.,2
Rahane now has his third chance to show his abilities don't bottle it pls..,1
R/cricket is so toxic. Its like players cannot have a bad phase. I have seen play when he was 14. He was well known in the cricket players circle. Would hit 4's and 6's for a joke. Calm the fuck down.,16
How is Shaw eligible for emerging player of whatever award lol.,5
"Fuck pace. All my homies like accuracy

- this meme is supported by CSK dad bois",6
"Unpopular opinion: when Pant returns I’m dropping Shaw, opening with Carey and batting Pant in the middle order.",6
Test cricket is best cricket hehe,5
Oh no.,2
Dhawan is the key player on this pitch if CSK get him cheap they can continue to choke and win,5
If Shikhar gets going we are done,8
Jesus what a shot,3
At last somebody finally remembered we have to score runs to win,2
Hmm...just joined and I get the feeling Shaw is not the promised one.,2
Delhi's theme music is shit. DD's original music was much better,3
They could score nothing for 10 more balls and they’ll still be ahead of CSK on RR,1
"Dhawan after the shot: Nah, I'm not running for this",3
"From  u/[RTG-rohittugaya](https://www.reddit.com/user/RTG-rohittugaya/)

**Prithvi Shaw's last 3 matches**

4, 0, 0

If he scores ""6"" in the next match, we can call Prithvi Shaw = 6 + 4 = ""Ten""dukar!",6
Hope Curran does not have a repeat of 2019 - Have amazing 3-4 matches and be bad in the rest of the games.,6
"If Dhawan and Rahane both perform, Shaw should be dropped for Pant and Hetmyer brought in for Carey",1
"damn , it took Ajinkya to be in playing eleven that forced Dhawan to play this good",10
"Can we start calling Prithwi Shaw ""Maggi-Man"" so that 3 years later he comes the best opener for India?",10
"I just realised that IPL will probably never have a team that sports a green jersey, for reasons.

Edit: Yeah, RCB used to wear green sometimes, but you get what I'm saying. No team will choose green as their franchise theme.",13
Open with stoinis when pant and hetmyer get back.,0
Does Dhawan still find a place in the Indian T20 team?,4
Not a bad over.,2
"In rare moments when the commentators aren't spouting useless facts or endorsing ugly ass cars, their analysis makes sense",1
Dugout calling out Shaw's  lack of fitness.,4
I'm still surprised how we went form a rr of 1.5 in the first few overs to this,5
Dugout going after Shaw and rightly so.,5
"Drop Shaw.  
Rahane, Dhawan, Pant, Iyer, Stoinis, Hetmyer, Harshal, Axar, Ashwin, Rabada, Nortje, Deshpande.",7
Some real shots fired at Shaw in the dugout,3
"Prithvi Shaw 

> Dead duck versus the moving ball

> Not a great player of spin 

> An absolute liability on the field 

> Fails to convert starts 9/10 times 

The only pro about him in T20 cricket is that he can ""sometimes"" be a dynamite upfront. 

Delhi shouldn't waste a retention OR RTM on him in the mega auction.",5
"drop shaw, open with jinx so that dhawan can play his game. Reason why he's so best coz rohit just holds an end",1
CSK should not take Rahane's wicket till 15the over to win this game.,5
Totally agree with The Dugout's criticism of Shaw.,5
Dhoni should give Jadeja captaincy and step aside now and appear at the consolation match that could get CSK to 10 points on table,-1
"The commentators in IPL(both Indian and foreign ) have the balls only to criticise the likes of unadkut, tewatia( in the beginning) and the likes ... grow some balls ffs. Compare it to EPL and NFL , where no player no matter how big is spared",11
Dugout taking digs,3
chahar rubbing some covid antibodies on that ball,6
The resemblance between shaw and Shastri is uncanny. Can’t unsee it.,6
"I have always had

Dhawan Stoinis Rahane Iyer Pant Hetmyer Axar Ashwin Rabada Nortje Ishant

As my best Delhi line up. Let’s see how long these guys take to figure that out. 

I know Ishant is out so play Tushar or Harshal Patel.",5
Chahar rubbing his face all over the ball. Don't understand why saliva is banned when everything else is allowed,5
Shaw's early wicket is putting pressure on Rahane.,6
Would love to see Chahar in Indian test squad one day.,5
The first Chahar over reminded me of Ajit Agarkar at Sharjah. Used to swing the ball and get early wickets.,3
"Curran is Sanju Pro Max

Sanju plays well for first 2-3 matches

Curran plays well for first 5-6 matches",6
"Good on Dugout to call out Shaw's appalling fitness. I remember a match where Kohli was running rings around him when batting together.

No excuse for poor fitness as a young, upcoming player. Same goes for Pant.",8
Chahar good early swing 👏🏽,4
"Genuine Q. How do they shoot out those replays of balls with trajectory and stuff overlaid as a trail, so fast?",8
"Rahane seriously has to play a good knock today, eating balls and then not scoring anything is the worst thing possible in t20s",3
[deleted],3
I want to see Rahane play today.,3
Dhawan is the most underrated cricketer of the last decade,3
A better throw and he'd have been out,2
What was Rahane dawdling for?,3
I think this is where the difference is now before CSK would make these run outs,6
"Chahar's not worried about acne, I guess",3
"I am low key panicking about Dhawan now 


heh",5
Prithvi needs to sniff more cough syrup,3
Want rahane to score but don't want delhi to win,2
Chahar is next bhuvi?,3
Peeps never buy Shaw-ed off shotguns. Fucking useless.,1
"Chahar not even trying to get Rahane run out there.

Knows the value of Rahane wicket",2
One of the dc players helping themselves to some dhokla,5
Sanga 💓,3
"CSK should really retain Chahar. I hope he gets picked for the Indian T20 World Cup side, he has serious potential imo",9
So he got out because he was hungry?,11
Shaw can always come back later as strong batsman. He got age on his side.,10
Lol Prithvi Shaw eating his dinner in the room.,14
Big Rahane-Stoinis partnership that brings DC home. Calling it now.,6
Is Shaw balding already?,4
"I thought Hetmeyer was a keeper, he isn't?",5
"Shikar ""absolutely"" Dhawan on roll.",4
"Dhawan isn't letting games slip away, top class.",2
Y’all want rahane to open and replace Shaw as if rahane has been anything special lol,4
"Could have been run out right, if Chahar collected the ball and hit the stump ?",5
"I am sorry daddy dhawan for doubting you that day, accept my apologies",6
"Gaand phate ya na phate
Lekin nawabi na ghate
- Shaw",11
Lovely shot,3
"Guys Pshaw was just v hungry 
His food was getting cold",11
Who convinced Dhawan that this is an ICC event?,28
Shaw was hungry for dinner. Ffs team manager should have seen it coming,11
"Is shaw stuffing his face with 2 minute maggi there? 
Haven't used that phrase in a while. Or seen that used either..",10
Aww prithvi smol boi eat food,11
"Dhawan is sexy, that's all.",7
Gabbar seeing the ball well today.,4
We have such quality batsman and we play Shaw to put unnecessary pressure on them. It’s so infuriating honestly.,2
Dude is depression eating,9
Shaw wants the shawarma,10
How is Prithvi Shaw so unfit? He posts lots of gym selfies on Instagram. Is he all show and no go?,6
I have seen so many people shit on Dhawan here. He is such a good player to watch.,4
Send Ponting to open instead of Shaw,11
pls rahane play till end,2
Oh yeah there is out specialist fielder Jadhav,5
I don'tt want to be horny anymore. I just want my man Rahane to perform well :(,5
Lol @ Shaw got out to eat,8
Lord Shaw: fuck this shit imma eat,4
[deleted],8
If Dhawan doesn't play sweeps today he could score big,2
Whats really scary is people on this sub wants Paddikkal & Shaw to open for India 🇮🇳.,4
What is this shitty song they play when DC player hits a boundary?,5
Lmao shaw chomping on food. Are we seeing the birth of the next Rohit? After a long phase of only 2 min innings our Vada Pav King became an unstoppable force.,15
Wait. I actually forgot that this is second innings.,2
Friendship ended with Rohit Sharma. Prithvi Shaw is my new Maggi man🤝🤝🤝,11
At least look at one ball Dhawan!,1
Lord Tupac Shakur is in bois,5
I will watch Hindi commentary if they can stop giving BJ to Dhoni.,2
Shaw's goodwill receding faster than his hairline,4
Fafdu gonna be CSK's next captain,7
Cricbuzz: Deepak Chahar has got Prithvi Shaw 5 times out of 6 now. And the only time he didn't get him was the last match where Prithvi nicked it off but no one heard the nick.,16
Did someone forget to turn off the lights in the other stadium?,3
Iyer needs to step up tonight or fuck off. Sick of him labouring to run a ball 30s and 40s. If he can’t deliver an innings of substance at a big strike rate tonight then Ponting needs to make the tough call.,0
Why is DC management forcing Prithvi to bat at his old age of 55,10
Thakur has bigger thighs than south indian actresses.,5
Shardul Thakur looks like a Kirana shop owner,6
You all know that pumpkin with the scary face that are put near new constructions in India to ward off the evil eye? Jadhav is exactly that for us right now.,9
"Lol shaw wanting to eat, i remember when afridi wanted to eat the ball",6
Did someone just throw up?,5
[deleted],7
"*hehehe* 

I am in danger.",3
Seems like it will be an easy chase for Delhi.,5
Which innings would you call the T20 equivalent of Gavaskar's 36(174) in the first ODI WC match?,9
"CSK is probably a  better fielding side than Delhi

That’s fucking ridiculous when you consider how Delhi is a team of youngsters",14
Shaw having big meal because he was tired playing 2 balls. Lovely guy,26
Now Jadhav will be in next 5 matches,14
Kedar Jadhav😳,5
Specialist fielder does his job.,11
Jadhav was the true specialist fielder after all,8
What is Rahane's role in the team?,6
Jadhav retained next match for that save :),2
That's our specialist for you,2
Kedhar doing the job,2
Thats the reason kedar is in team,2
What's the point of constantly cutting away to Shaw? Are players not allowed to eat now?,10
"Is it just me or is the ""crowd noise"" really muted/low in this DC innings?",2
"hoye hoye, shirtless nortje ke darshan ho gaye match safal",3
"See , see, that's why they have Kedar in the team. Backing the bowler on the throw, that's why.",4
Rahane is just a stylish Jadhav,3
Thakur to Gabbar...interesting.,7
CSK NEED another wicket in the powerplay to have chances in this match....,3
"Kedar couldn't score runs, so he will save runs",2
"Who's the better passenger? 

Vijay Shankar or Jadhav?",1
Jadhav with his most significant contribution yet,2
Lord Thakur needs to take wicket now.. about time,1
Jadav was picked just to save those 3 runs. Nice 5d chess from Thala.,3
"Imo punter is the best possible coach for shaw or any young indian lad, guy will give it straight and not sugarcoat anything. So expecting that shaw improves, guy when fires is something else",3
Shirtless Nokia Nortje😳,4
"So, RR's journey in this IPL is effectively over? Specially, If Chennai wins this",5
I feel like Sangakkara lurks on this sub,5
Go Rahane and remove that tocha boi out of the team.,0
I hope theyelevate Carey if Dhawan gets out. He can’t hit at the end anyway!,1
"Rahane is 8(9). Atleast, wait till he actually gets off to a flyer",0
Noooooooo not Rahane,3
"I kinda felt sad for Dhoni that we didn't have too many proper fast bowlers when he was captaining India and all the good young prospects are only coming of age recently. But even at CSK, Dhoni seems to prefer swing bowlers and medium pacers over out and out fast bowlers.",7
I liked test cricket anyway fuck T20.,4
CHAHAR AGAIN! WHAT A CATCH SAM! FUCK YEAH,6
DC collapse today😳😱,3
Gonzo.Boys he's  gonzo.,3
from Cricbuzz: Deepak Chahar has got Prithvi Shaw 5 times out of 6 now. And the only time he didn't get him was the last match where Prithvi nicked it off but no one heard the nick.,14
"Sam Curran is the real 3D, Rayudu's eternal rival",11
"GUESS WHO

IT'S SAM CURRAN",10
that was good catch curry chan 🥰,6
What a catch that is!,4
Useless Rahane. Ranji khel BC tu,3
That was some catch,5
what a CATCH,3
What a catch omfg,3
Holy mother of fuck!,5
Lol Shaw is the gill of DC,3
"PP Chahar is love, PP Chahar is life",6
Thats my boi Sam <3,3
Sam Curran what have you done ???,3
"CSK bout to do their yearly magic, aren't they?",6
That was such a good catch. Unlucky rahane:(,4
"hahaha, I was complaining earlier about Chahar's lack of early breakthroughs. Boy, did he fix it!!",3
Send Carey,1
[removed],10
Nooooo,1
Bring me my Pant and Hetmyer man.,4
That ball tailed away late at pace. What a catch.,7
One more and game is done,1
Rahane has been a bigger disappointment than I am for my parents,4
Rahane should retire,1
What a catch!!,4
Imagine that the we are so bad at the top that Rahane > Shaw lol.,2
"That is not a blinder, tf 😂 Good catch tho",6
YOUNG BLOOD^(TM),4
Singakutty!!,6
"What's Shaw IPL stats?


Is he an another mumbaikar who is enjoying a long leash of freedom?",7
I am OK with Rahane' intent. Atleast he looked technically fit to face fast bowling,10
Any Delhi fans getting slightly nervous now?😅😅,7
"Me : Opens r/cricket

Some random player : Yeh me karleta hoon. Ap Dream 11 pe team banao",6
3 failures in a row. Ffs Rahane.,3
Fees sad for my man Rahane :(,7
"Shreyas Iyer: ""bc why do I come 2 down.Might as well send me in as an opener""",3
All the guys shitting on Shaw and praising Rahane. Where are they now?,-2
CSK are winning the whole thing this year lmao it's so scripted,-4
"**4.1** Chahar to Rahane, OUT, Chahar has one more. Rhane's horror IPL continues **26-2**

AM Rahane c Curran b Chahar 8 (10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00",2
Oh yes Scurran,4
"RCB and DC, please please please do whatever you can to prevent a CSK-MI final.",8
"Let's be real, you can't have both Rahane and Shaw in the top 3. Passengers both of them. Delhi need Pant back urgently",3
"Wtf Curran, I just wrote a long comment about why CSK need to drop you for an overseas bowler and you go ahead and do that.",4
OK now they can built a great partnership and chase this score.,1
Rahane is the Collapse Initiator. Rahane fans dont spam DC's social media handles asking where is Jinx again,2
There's too much bass in the crowd track today. My room is booming.,3
Fuck we lose now.,0
Jadhav's role in team - celebrating wicket taking.,9
"Saar, why you make the five year old childrans taking the catches? Look yet that innosant boy. Why he is jumping yeround on the grass?",1
Ok I'm gonna say it. Kedhar Kundigraber.,8
end of rahane's ipl career,2
Gg csk. Let's move on to the next game,4
Being Pantsed this team does not feel the same,3
That wasn’t fair. Rahane needs to be forgiven for that innings and must play the next game. He looked in great touch.,7
Is any Delhi fan sweating rn?,6
Hate to say this but Rahane has to be benched. Luck is not on his side but T20 is pretty unforgiving.,2
I bet Nortje + Rabada will score more runs opening than Shaw + Rahane.,6
Sad reacts for Ajinkya Rahane. Haven't found his groove and brought Shikhar Dhawan into form,5
Start believing now guys. That 4th position is wide open for CSK to kick the door down and barge through it by end of group stage.,7
Sharjah is actually the most unchaseble ground if you bowl decently.,5
Iyer down,6
The fact about Earthboy is that he's always looked unfit to me. The problem is he hasn't improved.,4
We're losing this one.,4
Wht  happened to him?,2
Noice,1
"Wtf bruh, should've been an easy runout.",3
Things looking limp for dc,2
lol Sunny G,1
What is happening Delhi?😱,1
Sam be like: *Draw me like one of those French girls*,5
Does DC have replacement for Rahane ?,2
ABBE BC YAAR YEH KYA HAI,1
Still having Iyer and Dhawan at the pitch on the same time is pretty scary..,6
Watson with that lazy throw,5
Ffs I hope he is okay,5
Dunno why... But i find Deepak Chahar's face annoying!,6
Where is that bitch who said that RR lost a good batsmen like rahane?,0
Our team is made up of glass. Damn so injury prone,5
Now the fate is just toying with DC. Another injury.,10
oh shit. hate seeing players in pain like that,9
"Iyer injured? Delhi are fucked

Hopefully he doesn't try to play through it and make it worse",8
Dc and injury is like jay and viru,6
Goddamn Bravo with that backing up,6
As much as this is IPL and I do like CSK. I really hope Shreyas is okay here. He's a vital element in the international team right now and we can't miss him.,16
Wtf is gonzo? Has it always been a thing?,6
"Rahane's wicket wasnt that valuable in my opinion and DC is still pretty much in the game but they must be really rattled after seeing 2 wickets down and with Iyer damaging his hamstring maybe. 


Advantage CSK.",11
Bravo in the background doing Bravo things,12
Bravo 😂,3
yeah we're getting EXPOSED today,5
[deleted],1
So much happened on that one ball bruh xD,3
Already know someone gonna say shreyas is thicc,1
don't give CSK momentum you fools!,4
Iyer has no ass wtf. Disappointing,7
This nightmare keeps getting worse,3
Bravo stopping the ball like champ,10
I hope he is okay I am supporting CSK but I don’t want a win due to a key player not being able to continue,6
Bruh shoulder injury and then this?,6
[deleted],1
That dive says different story,3
Uh oh.,1
"Rahane vs Deepak Chahar in ipl:- 
4 innings-> 4 dismissal
all in powerplay",5
Oh Pant looks like Gulabjamun now,1
Ah it's the magic spray,1
"> **Ankit**: I think playing Rahane instead of Hetmyer shows a clear sign of preference for Indian players. 

Lol someone on Cricbuzz commented this. Do they even know the 4 player overseas limit?",19
Genuine Q. How did he get injured?,2
DC imploding wtf,3
CSK fielding like the tournament depending on it. Oh wait...,8
Tf cameramen give him some privacy stop showing us his ass,6
Why doesn't mark nicholas shut up,-2
Jadhav specialist cheer leader,5
"Meanwhile, chahar should continue pouring sweat on the ball",3
Bravo turning GK for a minute there,6
Hope Iyer is okay...nothing worse than seeing a player hurt,17
Gonzo?,2
CSK looks completely different?,3
TBH if he pulled a hammy then we are done for this season.,3
"I remember travelling to Bangalore just for a Bangalore match so I could see ABD in all his glory. It was my first ever match at a stadium. Not only RCB lost that (against Punjab) ABD and Kohli were huge flop too.

It hurts to see ABD go ballistic ending the playoff chances of a team that I support :(",3
Latter stages of the IPL and the scriptwriters have activated CSK's plot armor,6
Did Iyer just hurt himself again,1
not out,2
I feel sad for people supporting test players in a t20 match. Dhoni is the only player with such special talent.,4
"Finally, a direct throw which hit the stumps.",5
"Delhi in IPL final

Playing 11: Prithwi Shaw and 10 injured",12
"If Shreyas was not 100%, why the fuck was he playing? Brainless management.",7
Why is that being reviewed even? Doesn't look like out,4
Har match jaan daav pe rakh ke khel rahe hai madarchod,1
Dc bottled??,3
Jaddu finally hit ! If he's out then DC are in a heap of trouble.,5
nazar lag gai,4
DC are very prone to sudden collapses.,2
"Man, I just hope CSK don't make the playoffs. Not a team I'd rather watch least than them lol",6
Shaw binge eating will now be a legendary meme,4
What a gun throw im lovin it,5
Jadeja Dhawan Wholesome 100 Keanu reeves Reddit moment,8
Holy fuck suddenly CSK look so much active and full of intent,19
Why is DC so desparately trying to lose this?,5
Jaddu <3,3
Damn. The bits and pieces player almost got him there with that gun throw.,3
Jinks keeps on jinxing himself. Sed lyf.,3
DC should get some Boost milk for Shaw before match,4
"FUCK me, this might be over",5
Patrick Farhart has to be a literal god for somehow making iyer fit that quickly,11
Why are there field umpires,6
Surprised that lousy third umpire didn’t think that was out.,8
Fielder hugged batsman. *iPl fIxEd!* 🙄,12
"imo, Iyer should've rested this game...",3
CSK on minefield pitches are unbeatable. It’s their whole game lol.,10
Have they finally fired Anjum and Lisa?,1
Delhi fans getting some heart attacks right now😂😂👍🏽,7
Why were they all so happy hahaha,7
"Just get a partnership, 70 runs in 10 overs",4
If Jaddu was in Watson's position Iyer would've been out.,6
Is this CSK fielding??,13
High,3
Jaddu will make a good IPL umpire,7
Out,2
Too high??,2
CSK is doing everything right today,5
[deleted],-1
I think all the umpires should retire.,9
"Two early wickets down, why not take two quick runs -_-",6
In line but maybe going over?,2
Wholesome!,4
That looked out to me,7
Jaddu is fucking awesome,3
Too high!,2
At what framerate do they broadcast IPL usually?,3
pant the medic,6
"That looked pretty plumb, didn't it?",7
why no DRS? Review won't be wasted as it would atleast be Umpire's call.,4
Jadeja be like : It's out. Now move on (to Dhawan),5
No one giving jadhav any attention when he came to Congrats,8
Height problem,3
To all those asking why CSK got all those fairplay awards. Its because of Raina and Jaddu,8
"Prithvi Shaw is the true successor of the number 10 jersey.  
  
I mean the Afridi one.",16
[deleted],2
Csk giving death stares to umpires and then hugs opposition to retrieve those fair play points,12
IMO Iyer should get off the field asap. Don't care if DC loses he shouldn't be injured.,5
Wasn't that out?,6
Cannot wait for a MI vs CSK ipl final..Again.,8
Goddamnit Delhi what the hell is happening?😅,4
Umpire looking at Dhoni...,4
We haven't won a match yet chasing in this IPL,5
The Altroz is so advanced that we should petition for it to replace the umpires.,8
"Not having Panty in the middle order is hurting DC, even if he wasn't in good form before getting injured. Just having him in the middle soothed DC.",3
Kaise Dhawan ne ghusaaya....balla. SMG on Hindi commentary will now get a stinker message from Shikhar's wife.,3

"Wherever you are right now, be thankful you ain’t in fucking Islamabad.",5
Why the fuck would you take on jadejas arm when you're two down for not much? Especially when your partner has just been hobbled by a blow..,3
Req run rate already above 10,1
Chad CSK 29-1 vs Virgin DC 29-2.,10
"DC batting -> hectic as ever. Compared to this, the batting from Watto+Faf feels serene as sea.",2
So much hugging today,7
"CSK stop don't do that, don't give me hope :(",5
I want Sir Jadeja's confidence in being incorrect,11
"Come on Iyer, what a shot",6
What a fucking shot,2
SHOT! That was insane.,3
Fucking Shot,2
Brilliant,2
DC > csk,2
Best hit of the match,4
Terrific shot,3
Class written all over it,3
2019 and 2020 Dhoni seem so different!!! Why?,1
Whatcha doing my boys😭,1
"Takoor back to form😎

Bowling short and length balls",1

"Some shot, that is.",2
Lord thakur in the house today,1
Pls give Chahar the 4th over as well. He is shit in the end.,2
Lord Thakur,1
Fucking beautiful shot,4
"Wait, what.",3
Iyer gonna take Thakur to the cleaners now. Both of them play for Mumbai so Iyer likely has Thakur's number,6
"My god, shot of the tourney",9
Shot,7
Dhawan is such a wholesome person overall,16
I love straight drive sixes.,11
DC are 2 wickets down already wtf!?,2
That is the Shardul we know.,5
"To all people thinking Pant is our best batsmen, I always keep saying Iyer is our best batsmen",5
"r/cricket was saying Shreyas is tuktuk? 
(Plz don't hole out to midwicket again Iyer)",8
commentators and r/cricket not shitting on thakur makes me sad :(,3
Wtf was that fake throw from Rayudu? Isn't fake fielding against some rule or something?,13
Shardul Thakur resembles actor Harish Kalyan...he could get himself a tamil movie gig,10

CSK fair play,7
"Some bromances we saw this match.
 Faf- rabada.

Nothing better than a lofted on drive for 6 off a quick. Sex.,7
CSK at number three on fair play. Smh,1
Guys why does the bot have a RCB flair?,2
"Please haters, kedar is not in the team just for his Fielding.

He is also wicket celebrations in charge",31
"sunny g : when a batsman is on 0, he wants to make a run

like yeah we are all on the same page",20
Rohit deserves Bharat Ratna for being top of fair play with Pollard in the team,13
Swann being a Royals fanboy is a good recurring bit,3
How the fuck is CSK anywhere near the top in Fair Play???,4
I have heard a rumour that Watson may bowl leg breaks this evening. You heard it here first.,7

Isn't that wide?,0
"As an Indian fan I love nothing more than Gabbar timing the ball well, but please not today... Mercy",4

Dhawan batting fantastically,3

Moral victory™",2
"Dhawan and Jadeja are hugging, Kedar comes and pats while Chahar is looking on

Totally Wholesome ❤",9
"Even if DC lose both these wickets they still have Carey,  Stoinis and Axar to come. I don't think CSK are gonna win this unless they get another wicket maiden or two.",5
Dhawan is a bit iffy against the spinners.,3
PP to CSK Pommie. There is no way DC team will be happy,4
Local Train staying true to the pattern of bowling 2 shit balls every over.,5
That six with a straight bat over long on resembled Sachin's balance on his on drivers against the likes of Donald and Lee. It has convinced me that Shreyas Iyer is the next big thing of Indian cricket since Kohli and Rohit and Bumrah. That was a special shot.,8
"Savage Roasting of RR in the dugout commentary! Awesome. ""Don't know what RR has done this season other than hand over victory to other teams""!!",5
Thakur gonna give Unadkat a tough challenge for today's shittiest bowler award.,5
How good is Dhawan against Jadeja?,3
"Admit it CSK and DC fans, tonight you are going to skip peeing and pooping to watch this match😂👍🏽",6
Someone please get Sanga back to the commentary.,3
"Every time Dhawan gets going, you just can't keep your eyes off him - it is just beautiful to watch. Even Rohit Sharma pales in comparison when Dhawan gets on song. Maybe it's his swagger or just the fact that he is a classic left hander.",6
"For every fucking bloke asking why match bot had rcb flair, it's cuz rcb was a meme last yr after their 6 losses in a row",5
The background song is vibey,4

Just NO reverse sweeps please",6
"Who are in the dugout now? Lara, swann,....  3rd one?",1
"So csk is gonna end up in the playoffs, what a roller coaster journey it has been",6
"I worry that Rahane has started declining pretty rapidly as a batsman in general. In LOIs/T20s, he wasn't really good but the way he's lost his overall touch that's concerning; be it the indifferent footwork, inability to find gaps, or playing on the up constantly.

He's slotted at number 5 for Indian Test team which is a pivotal position. Coming to the Australian tour later, he inspires no confidence.

He had a good series in Caribbean, so will get in the XI. It might be a make or break series for him.",7
So whoever gets MVP gets altroz?,1
Jadeja runs so quick lmao,2
"Best top 2 Batsmen: Shaw, Rahane, Jhadav
Best Bowlers: Khaleel, Siraj, Yadav

He's dropped the match,1
bad bad attempt,2
What the fuck was that,3
Would've been the most crucial catch,6
Been some poor fielding in this game,3
Omfg he dropped the match,4

Chahar showing Dhawan a replay of how Dhawan dropped his catch,11

Dropped the match ?,7
"After 6 overs 

Csk : 39/1

DC : 41/2",7
"Watching my first full IPL match in years. 
CSK better win and keep up the playoff record.",4
Oh fuck me,5
Is it just me or does he have a bandaid on his finger?,5
Chahar for how well you've performed today. I guess you can be let off for that but to be honest it wasn't that far off.,11
Dropped😪,5
SOMEBODY PLEASE ANSWER how do i get my teams flair?,3
"Free wickets this year :

"For all this talk of fair play award, there is just around half a point difference between the first and last. Judging by the umpiring this season, the umpires are just as arbitrary with those points as with the onfield decisions.",15

Diving for no reason,8
And Dhawan hugs Chahar now,17
Dropped twice in a row. CSK ruined their chances at winning this.,15

Fuck fuck fuck,1
"Csk fielding, smh..",3
I feel so bad for Hetmyer. Hope he's back next game with Pant.,9
Jadeja bringing his net contribution to 0,10
This is Ricky Ponting's way of playing cricket. Attack!,9
Shit fielding.,7

Man seeing Hetmeyer playing a wonderful innings then getting benched for the next few games because of Pant’s injury is so sad,24
"Wait jadeja didn’t yell at fielders for dropping a catch and acted like how you are supposed to act

Jadhav is the kind of guy who'd buy an Altroz.,10
"Question, what will happen after timeout?",9
"Dhawan chill please, play ground drives",13
My boi Lamichhane in the dugout unlucky to get a single game this season,6
Always wondered why they only have timeouts in the IPL and not in any other t20s,7

Shit the scoreboard says DL par score 63 :/,6
"Jadeja is a great LOI batsman but his bowling has always been lackluster in this format. 

That was the reason KulCha made inroads into the team.",12
Was just talking about how this is my first full IPL match in years. I didn't want a 90s throwback fielding moment to commemorate that..,5
He might've dropped the fucking match smh.,7
Neither of them were easy catches. But they make the game really hard.,10
Reason number 1 million why we should drop Shaw: Dhawan does his role better anyway!,9
Doesn't look good for us.,8
I love swanny but I wonder how would he react when his favourite tewatia runs out the batsmen stepping out,7
QUESTION. What is more cringe than those Josh ads?😐🤦🏽‍♂️,11
Watching replay of Sam Curran’s catch it looks like they’re petting a dog after lolol,16
WE WON THE MATCH BOIS,-13
Deepak Chahar bowls good but he seems so unsure about his run up.,6
Chahar's fielding has been shit since 2018. He still hasn't improved it smh,5
Watson's like a knight. Everytime he moves I hear a sqeal from his unoiled body parts,12
Unrelated question but who does de cock open with for SA?,3

Stoinis was like “don’t do that”,36
"Controversial opinion but hear me out: These Chennai matches especially look dodgy, atleast with the number of dropped catches, noballs in crucial moments n all, these matches look somehow (cliché, I know) scripted. 
And they are keeping these same old players, with Dhoni as the masthead pulling a tight ship. These games certainly look very dodgy to me.",-25

Iyer time,4
"Damn, I don’t care about winning anymore. We have a wholesome team!!",19
To be able to meme around someone like Punter just shows the atmosphere in the DC camp. Everyone just seems happy and joking around.,13
Pant' antics just relaxed me. It's just one bad game boys.. No biggie. We will be back next match.,9

Ffs Chahar why didn't you catch Dhawan.,2
"> Dropped by Dhoni or has it not carried?. Full and wide by Bravo. Front-of-the-hand slower ball, Dhawan looks to drive, his bat hits the ground, but the ball hits the edge, and it carries low to Dhoni's left, who is just late on it. The glove just comes down late. No other way of saying it

I really love how Dhawan learned from that 50 where he had a low strike rate and these two games he came back with more intent.,11

If he is in fact that bad at batting what hope is there of him accelerating up to the required strike rate at the end of the innings? The sort of arguments commentators make for bad starts is incredible. I love Iyer, I think he's great, but he needs to get a move on regardless of what Dhawan is doing.",2

This CSK team shouldn't be in top 4 -

Most of the 

1. Batsman can't run hard between wickets. Not many in great hitting form either.
2. Fielders can't stop singles , making moderate catches look difficult.
3. Bowlers are less penetrative than before, lackluster fielding doesn't help either.

Overall a weak csk team , more reputation than performance.

- csk supporter remembering the era where anyone from the playing 11 was confident to pull it off for the team.

Now just too many passengers.

As if Dhawan hitting boundaries wasn't enough.,3
Dhawan needs to finish this by staying there till the end. No switch hits or a soft dismissal by giving fielding practice to covers fielder. We rarely see him finish for India too.,5
CSK should now unleash the Kedarlitharan.,11

Has Dhawan made 100 in IPL before? Looks like the perfect setup for him to make his maiden hundred here,3

"When batsman is playing proper cricket shots and finding gaps like Dhawan is rn, bowlers have no chance. They need to keep Stoinis quiet to create pressure.",8
"If it was up to me i would want this whole squad to be retained for next 2-3 years, rahane can go wherever he wants",2
Bring shardul on. He'll get a wicket or go for 20runs. It's do or die now.,14
Shikhar 'Sixes are overrated' Dhawan.,9
It's so nice to not have KP in the commentary. I like him as a player but he's a terrible commentator.,2
Yeah right. Give a wide if you can.,1
"Our brothers are winning the match today (DC is CSK'S brother team) 

P.S : My coping mechanism.",11
Dhawan has actually hit it all over the ground.,7
"All those dropped catches cost the match...CSK can forget this match , no comeback possible",-3
"If we go to Dhawan's ear and say: it's not icc tournament leave.
And on stonis ears: Look it's Langer he is watching you.
We can surely get a wicket.",7
"Might not be a bad punt to get Jadhav to Bowl an over or 2 here. 

Pretty sure Stoinks might not have faced that weird Bowling and Gabbar might find it tough too.",11
Without pant and hetmayar middle order lacks fire power to chase big targets,6
This game is nicely in the balance,1
FFS how is Dhawan so lucky?,5
Jadeja hasn't bowled yet has he?,7
Come of Dangerous Dhawan and SuperSmasher Stoinis! Take this win home!,1
"It's no fucking way 50-50, it's 70-30 imo",10
Stoinis has been a really sensible middle order batsman today so far. Rotating strike plus trying to make the most of bad balls as well,8
This is the best I have seen Dhawan bat in IPL.,4
"Playoffs are gone if CSK lose the match, they can do whatever they want now",4
Dhawan is getting consistent now rahul has to stat pad more to retain the orange cap and the wooden spoon.,3
"Just two quick wickets, please.",-1
Karn is back thank god.,2
Dhawan has gained his SRH tier form just in time for DC. He had been very conservative at the start of the tournament. His slow game was the reason we beat them actually.,5
another Karn over😰,2
Another over for Karn. This could be a make-or-break over in the context of the game.,2
Even the win percentage is afraid of dhoni.,3
"Dhawan may have the biggest picture in the r/Cricket sledged to form academy


Unadkat seems to have an immunity from sledging",2
Please Karn. One wicket. Plizz.,1
Oh shit Sam Curran PTSD last year against us :/,4
Karn? Tf?,0
Why KARN??!,0
This is the over Karn gets his revenge,0
I think this is the make or break over,6
Who is this robot commentator with Mark Nicholas?,1
Karn pls da,4
Wicket incoming.....,4
Gotta bring Jaddu in and try to get a wicket at the cost of a big over,-2
"I dont realise the need of both dhawan and rahane in the team , both of them are batsman who are not known for power hitting , they should just be playing one of them ( dhawan)",2
Why did SRH let go Dhawan.,2
Jadeja is broken,2
My god I love this form of Dhawan-aggressive with caution.,6
This is depressing. Those catches should have been taken. At least two of them,7
Shit's fucked up when Jadeja misfields,9
If CSK lose this Playoffs is gone for sure right?,8
So pleasing to hear new commentators express their admiration for Jadeja's batting and fielding. 🤗,0
Hope r/cricket will meme koach back to form like they did to dhawan,6
"how bad is the dew, everyone shining that ball like it's Srini mama's?",5
"Dhawan trying desperately to get out..

Csk : aise kaise bc.",0
Senile Kings are rubbing on Jadeja,1
I had high hopes for csk winning during 1st innings and now its dashed :(,4
sweeps scare the shit out of me,1
Jadega has gotten the influence of his teammates in fielding this time.,4
"CSK would be so much better with both Hazlewood and Tahir. One of them should definitely be playing ahead of Bravo and the other, perhaps in place of Watson. Bowling simply lacks teeth. Shardul overperformed for a few matches but that won't happen every other day.",2
Hit a wide ball for one.,1
So many cars in the parking lot! The bio secure bubble must be a joke.,3
DAE feel Jaddu has been dropping and misfielding too many this season by his standard?,5
how is sanju samson still on this list.. please,4
Shikhar DaOne to lead DC to number one spot.,5
[deleted],10
"Dhawan is batting till the end in this ipl. 

This is rare.",12
"A lot of people are asking what does Kedar bring to the team.  It's simple, he brings a truckload of bad luck for the team. Remember how he didn't play after the first match in 2018 and we ended up winning the tournament?",8
where did CSK spent all their money? they don't even have a flagship bowler wtf,6
Karn Sharma is just a short Randeep Hooda.,16
Lmao all this tension & nerves shit... Lord Thakur gonna make this win so easy for DC at the end.,4
Still waiting for Star Sports to show the replay of Dhoni's drop of Dhawan..,16
What a shot,9
Dhawan is just toying with Karn Sharma,9
Shikhar reminding of his test debut,6
That was a typical gabbar shot 😻,9
Ooh Dhawan keeping 90s cricket alive 😎,10
That shot was the batting equivalent of Dhawan's thigh slap!!,10
Dhawan is batting like a dream this IPL,18
LMAO DHAWAN,12
Wtf Dhawan lmao,13
Still remember how Ingram had responsibly denied Dhawan his much deserved century last season,4
They're gonna win with 7 wickets,6
Good save also lol Dhawan.,8
I’m sorry but playing Karn here is just stupid captaincy,9
Dhawan on form is just gorgeous to watch. His debut test innings was so fluent and fearless.,13
"Why the heck he keeps bowling on the pads , dumb stuff this is",4
Great fielding,6
lol dhawan trolling,11
Why was Dhawan shouting to Stoinis lol,11
"Such placement,much wow",5
Not a spinners day today I suppose,2
Dei yenda azha vekkaringa... Olunga velaiyandaalum olunga velaiyadamatengareenga.😭,1
"If CSK lose this, this will be their worst season standings ever

They won 4 of 9 in 2010",8
Dhawan trolling Stoinis. What’s happening 😂,12
Dhawan with the comedic yesnoyesno,18
Dhawan is such a clean striker of the ball,8
"Would love to see karn sharma pitch map ..

I bet it's atleast 70 percent full.",4
Dhawan fucking with MSD lol,8
Dhawan 🤣🤣,7
CSK vs DC was supposed to be young v old but we are getting destroyed by an oldie in Dhawan :(,6
Hahahhaha I love Shikhar,6
"Dammit Sam, full commitment.",6
"Chahar took 2 wickets and will still get shit on due to his drop catch

1 catch> 2 wickets",5
DhawN fucking around with Dhoni,7
These fantastic fours are much more elegant to watch than smashing sixes :p,3
TIL that shikar the one is the highest  scoring opener in IPL...even more than Gayle and Warner .,2
Dhawan feels like he's playing his debut again against Australia.,11
CRR: 8.73  REQ: 9.8,3
"It's been a bad season for CSK, but atleast we found Sam Curran.",6
Dhawan is simply bossing the mediocre bowlers. At times in IPL I see too much respect shown to them. In form Dhawan is imperious.,11
Shikhar D is as good as they come. Underrated cricketer. He is a very consistent batsman in international cricket as well.,9
Beautiful shot that,3
What was that from Dhawan?😂Taking a dig at CSK influencing umpire's decisions ? 😂,5
BC don’t get run out now!,5
Lol Dhawan with the YES NO YES NO,8
Ahaha Dhawan,7
"Dhawan points at Stoinis and shouts - ""**YES.. NO.. YES.. NO..** and then gives out a smile.",7
Shikhar taking the absolute piss lmao he's enjoying this,9
Lmao DC really don't give a fuck. This is a practice match to them,9
All I want is for Dhawan's best partner to date in IPL to do well tomorrow.,5
Karn Sharma looks like the kind of guy who'll call his party members in bcci office and cancel ipl if csk are eliminated,9
Lol Dhawan taking the piss with those yes no yes no,9
Dhawan parodying the classic yes yes yes yes no.,10
Remember kids dropping catches seldom win matches,6
Every over is as per the required run rate. Gabbar computer,10
Dhoni is gonna tear Karn a new hole after the match 😂,6
CSK will purchase Dhawan next auction after he retires,3
Last week my mother asked what the ad with a donkey in office was about. I said I dunno 🤷,4
One wicket and this is CSK’s game,3
"Just catching back on, is the strategic bullshit done?",1
They still have a chance if Dhawan gets out..,2
Dhawan channelling his inner Tushar Kapoor!,2
Dhawan please get a 100 today,1
"Inb4, ICC bans Dhawan for excessive appealing to his own teammate",3
Gabbar really enjoying himself out there,7
Dhawan trolling MSD is peak 2020,8
Someone please get dhawan out,4
Csk not making it to playoffs this year so that I can study for finals without being distracted. Thank you csk for caring about my grades,9
Last week of this IPL gonna be boring before playoffs. Top 4 are getting away quickly 😞,2
"As much as the odds are stacked in favour of DC, I kinda hope to see CSK come back in, in this match. That'd be quite fun to watch.",3
Oh man csk gonna win this 😫,1
This is torture for csk fans,4
just need two fucking wickets now pls,6
Some right arm rubbish from Kedar pls.,4
Omg it’s shardul. We finally have a wicket this over.,3
Dhawan wants to be his Zampa for chad Stoinis.,2
Delhi don’t lose this please. I can’t take two L’s in a day,1
Karn sharma has been pretty good this IPL. Dont know whats up with him in this game,2
"On one hand I want to see CSK win, on the other hand I want to see Dhawan's century",3
Dhawan is absolutely going to open in Australia for LOIs. Maybe a bit unlucky for Agarwal.,2
Lord Thakur will win the match for CSK,2
"50 off 5, Game of nerves and cool now. We all know who is called ""Captain Cool""...",1
"Love Shikhar the One ...great attitude , top batsman under pressure , a boundary finder only next to Kohli . Don’t know why this sub doesn’t rate him highly .",3
Thakur and Gabbar Sholay vibes,2
"I’m still wondering whether that Green guy in KKR yesterday is a spinner or pacer? He doesn’t spin it, but bowls slow enough for spin.",3
"I always shit on Dhawan for his slower knocks, and being careless in games. But damn, seeing him bat this way is just a delight. The man is just lovable, and in form, even more so.",3
2 overs of fast spin by shardul,2
This was CSK match to win but their great players made a match for us. Keep it up CSK,1
"Mumbai needs to lose tomorrow, not because I want a thrilling qualifier but because I'm a DC fan :p",1
r/cricket rn: Thakur Gabbar jokes😎👍🏽,4
"csk points out for dhawan that this is not an icc tournament, and he throws his wicket. ezee",3
"Sam looks like he's taking it personally. Chillax, dude. Shit days happen",7
The game is [tight](https://tenor.com/xlUg.gif),1
"Dhawan is such a lovely character, he is like faf. No one can hate him.",1
Fuck me in the asshole,5
the ball is like a wet soap.,3
Yet another dropped catch....,3
Again????,3
How many catches would you drop?,1
9lives Dhawan,4
Dhawan is fucking lucky tonight,7
Lol Roydu,8
Just fucking end me at this point this shit hurts too much to be real,6
Dropped the game there.?,3
2D liability,5
Dhawan has been hella lucky lol,6
I can imagine situation would have been so much better with Raina and Bhajji. This would have allowed them to get Tahir in and someone out and still have a stong batting lineup.,4
3rd drop,6
Rayudu also wants to see Dhawan get his century,9
Lmao drop. Wtf?,8
MonkaS,5
alright I give up. who many catches are we going to drop today?,5
It's over for CSK now. Surely,2
Dhawan has been dropped 4 times today. CSK deserves to lose.,5
You $*#$%&#& spoilt Lord Sharduls wicket opportunity.,1
Ball looks scary in three dimensional view,1
FIXED TM /s,1
Another drop. This is meme level fielding.,2
"Wow dhawan , FOUR times he has been put down",6
Make sure u find someone who loves u the same way csk loves dhawan,2
Csk helping Dhawan reach his first ipl century. ❤️❤️,3
Wtf!,1
That's a beauty. I wanna see that in slow motion,1
[deleted],-4
I'll be surprised if we win now.,7
"Saw a comment about saying how CSK's fielding is better than DC, are you sure?",2
so rayudu doesn't have that fielding wali dimension to his game,3
Dhawan should buy a lottery today,3
[deleted],-2
Dhawan has 9 lives....,3
4th drop. CSK want to take this match deep. Dhoni is an addict,4
Oh fuck off.,2
Fuck me sideways!! What the fuck CSK?,3
I would be very surprised if Sam Curran doesn't get RTM'd in the mega auction. I am guessing they'll retain Dhoni Rayudu and Thakur. RTM Faf and Curran,0
AAAHAHAHAHA. WHistlepodu ......buttplug show,1
3 drops wow. Shikar wow.,2
Mantar padh ke aaya hai tera bhai,2
"Dammit, fuck me in the eyes.",2
The mishits are going for 6s.,1
Every CSK player has Dhawan in their fantasy team!,4
Dhawan at this form and luck will score his first ipl 100 bois,5
Man has more lives than a cat,6
Great shot. BIG LEVERS LEZGOOO,2
How tf does that go for six lol.,3
BIG STOINIS,1
You’ll troll 3D by comparing his batting to Rayudu. So lemme do the same with fielding too bois.,5
How do you drop someone so many times,5
"A hug goes a long way.

Be kind kids",1
Why did ambatty rayudu drop it,1
Dhawan is so damn lucky today. 3rd time. 3rd dropped catch.,3
This is now embarrassing,5
Just saying Vijay shankar would have caught that.,5
"Curran 3D ☑️
Rayudu 3D ✖️",6
ain't gonna win if we keep dropping catches,3
Fuck this year's IPL!,5
"Rohan Gavaskar just said ""Unfortunately Dhoni has been let down in the field ""

Excuse me, he dropped the easiest catch of the night lmfao",4
Yeah DILLI come on boys!,2
Lmao the power of this man,4
"**Meme level fielding from CSK, How are you going to play IPL with this pathetic fielding**",3
Stoinis is a monster,3
You can't make this shit up.,5
Fuck me already Marcus,5
That idiotic camera man again,9
"Thats a bad drop, you gotta take those",8
"RCB win

CSK lose

Best weekend ever",9
"I'm donating my left kidney if csk wins this

Edit : My kidneys live to see another day",9
"Hold on, Rayudu, it wasn't so tough now.",6
Rubbing wound on CSK's salt,3
BIG BOY POWER!,2
sliced it for a six lmao,2
Out,0
That’s why Dhawan acts friendly with everyone while batting . It messes their heads and they drop catches .,5
Stoinis with that big boy power,1
Thank you! Thank you so much! Now onto Dhawan please. Just tell me it isnt too late,2
"See guys, this is why there are days when 3D has value",6
Fuuuuuck,2
"The form of Rahul, Dhawan, Mayank and Rohit will give Kohli some thinking to do for the WC.",5
FINALLY ONE GONE,2
Just end me,0
He’s too powerful,1
*Shani dev ki pooja kara ke aiye hai shikhar dhawan*,4
If there wasn't covid there would definitely be a CSK fan with MAARO MUJE MAARO part 2,4
Thakkur strikes again!!,2
"shit, here we go again",2
"Gonzo. Boys, he's a gonzo.",3
Wrong guy again,4
Solid cameo from Stoinis,4
I WAYS KNEW TUPAC SHAKUR WILL GET THE WICKET.,6
We had lost the match in our first 10 overs itself. I don't want to hear any slow wicket shit. Brilliant lightning partnership by Watson and Faf. 👏,5
So 3 full chances drop and 1 half chance from Watson . They deserve to lose.,5
CSK is so unlucky. We chose to bowl when there was no dew and now we chose to bat when there is dew,7
Fuck me. This is too close now,3
How much CSK paying Jadhav for his service?,5
Final fuckinglyyyy,1
What a meme over this is. Jeez.,3
" Don't wanna jinx it, 
But eager to see dhawan's thigh slap after his century.",13
Tupac Shakur redemption,6
"They did it again, another correct wicket alert.",7
Possibly winning 2 out of 3 with the team balance disturbed gives great confidence,6
Chennai is normally bad in ground fielding but were good in catching....today is the opposite.,8
FINALLYYYYYY!!,3
F,4
Swanny just jizzed his pants,9
Pls don't fuck this up 🥺,6
Lord thakur with wicket taking pies,5
Finally they realise the ball is meant to be caught and not paddled away heh,5
FUCKING FINALLY.,1
"There are two great teams, one better than other. The other 6 teams are ok with rcb the best of that lot because they have AB Devilliers.",6
Swann is more invested in the dugout competition than he is with anything else,8
dhawan ko out karo pls omg,2
Collapse incoming :(,3
Ambatty displaying his second dimension,8
Swanny knew it was coming. *iPl iZZ f1x3d* 🙄,7
Why do we want to smash 6s,3
"Carey has to justify his purchase today, he is a great bloke but has to come good today. Pls alex take us over the line",7
Now Dhawan will have to get that 100 for DC to win.,3
This will be such a spicy end to the game,3
Was he asked to get out before the 16th over ends. What were these shots?,2
Still DC's game,6
Lord Thakur too slow for Stoinis to get any timing on it,9
If only CSK had taken previous catches as well,2
Carey pls justify your replacement now,2
Oh god fuck me now Carey will come in and play just like Shreyas. What a shit middle order.,0
That's one of the most silliest looking shots.,3
"Stoinis did what he was sent to do,hope the timeout doesnt break their momentum",2
"**15.4** Thakur to Stoinis, OUT, Thalur keeps coming at Stoinis. Goes even shorter this time. Stoinis is shuffling across to look to work this square on the leg side. Gets a massive top edge for a catch at midwicket **137-4**

MP Stoinis c Rayudu b Thakur 24 (14b 1x4 2x6) SR: 171.42",3
Still not Dhawan,3
It was 43 off 27. No harm at all taking a single.,3
Swann got the moves,6
Could’ve been two wickets in the over lmao,4
"Bc we're in full control, let's not be KXIP",9
Even if Dhawan and Carey get out now DC can still win this comfortably. 40 runs is easy for Axar and Ashwin,0
Swann is doing the floss fucking kill me.,9
CSK is only generous with Dhawan today,6
"""Our cricket cum chess champion."" O_o wat",4
Why is Pant not playing btw?,3
my eyes Swann,7
I want CSK to lose every game from here on. Fielding has been shit. Painful to watch.,8
Stoinis should finish these chases. Disappointing.,7
Swann doing a Fortnite dance,4
Dhawans wicket would have been good too.,8
They caught because it was Stonis and not Dhawan,13
"Delhi don't lose it ,don't let a south Indian team win

/s",-5
Stoinis what have you done mate. Should have played it cool.,12
He just doesn't need to go for another one. He can take a breather match is in their hands.,4
Swanny fuck me already what a dance,17
*Swanny got some moves*,12
"Sanga with the deadpan humour, 'Advice for young batsmen...watch marcus stoinis go to the gym...'",22
"timing: \*exists\*

Stoinis: Im gonna ignore that",20
I really want to see a dhawan 100,10
DC choking,6
Thakur is a sneaky good wicket taker,3
Stoinis is white Pollard,13
Carey is so useless at the end. Should open with him instead of Shaw instead without Pant.,4
Where is my ponting face zoom.,7
"Carey can't hit sixes, i dont see many fours coming. :/

Still a chance for csk this season",4
"Omg Swann doing fortnite dances, why even have non dugout commentary",20
Swann flossing is the worst thing I've ever seen,13
Captain setting the fields performing sharingans.,1
"What's the point?

Dhawan will win them the match.",12
Dhawan Durga maa ka bhakt hai. Aaj  mata ji khush hai uspar. 1st day blessings. No other logic why he is still on pitch lol. Would love his century a Delhi win.,7
"You heard it first here,

DHAWAN WON'T FINISH THE GAME GUIS",9
Of course the Dugout must be watched for Graeme Swann's Fortnite dancing,28
Alex Carey can't afford to build dots and put pressure on Dhawan.,10
This is why Gavaskar says take a single after a six,19
"It's always so wholesome to players like Dhawan enjoying themselves out in the open and actually having fun, you know. Makes spending all those hours into the passion of cricket very, very worthwhile and fulfilling.",13
I feel like CSK gonna win now . Dhawan will get too aggressive and end up getting out,7
"Amused at how DC fans are fretting over a wicket, Axar & Ethical can bat too",14
"Oppo making ""Diwali"" edition phones is just plain hilarious considering the state of Indo-China relationship",15
Stoinis... [He goes to the gym](https://i.imgur.com/u9O3Cga.jpg),5
Fixer Patel should come out to bat.,-1
"Continuing my point from previous post. Here is another gem in this match thread.

> Rohan Gavaskar's cricketing career was one of the more blatant cases of nepotism there was. I'm sure it's no coincidence that Daddy Dearest is a well known, highly influential cricketer and commentator. 

I can't believe a basic fact check is too much to expect  these days. Rohan didn't even play for Mumbai FFS. He played for Bengal because he couldn't get in the Mumbai squad. I swear some people are frothing at mouth to be outraged about imaginary BS.",11

Good thing is Carey is a quick runner,9
Both of this would run good between the wicket,6
"Argh, if Dhawan wasn't dropped so many times this game would've been over by now. Why you do dis to me CSK.",30
Chennai has eXpErIeNcE,-2
Brace yourself for Carey pun jokes,10
DC will miss Hetmeyer today,10
Dhawan played slow against MI because it was his Bro Brohit on the other side,21
Come on Carey. Time to announce your arrival.,10
pls dont choke,9
CSK is such a shit team damn,13
Hey look its Kedar Jadhav,12
"Dc isn't batdeep, they have to save wickets now",12
Alex Carry the team home,6
Looking at Dhawan's luck this match he can only be dismissed by his the batman in the other end. Fingers crossed.,5
Carrey at no. 6 is worse than Gayle at no. 3,2
At least we won't fuck up the NRR. So it wasn't so bad chasing a big target,5
"Csk is the dream, we can't get a break from singles",3
Jadeja seems to hit the stumps only when the batsmen has already got in.,7

Just chase this down in 19 overs and let us cry it out.",2

"Imagine if we had pant and hetmyer right now, zero pressure because match would've been in the bag two overs ago",3

"RRR has been just around 10 for a while now, DC did well in that sense",2
What is Carey trying??,4
Never seen dhawan finishing matches and never will see him in future.,5
Why do i feel like DC gonna bottle this,8
"Man these ads shouldn't make English players speak Hindi, it sounds fucking weird",9
Save us Sam,2
Just need one good clean over and CSK would be back in.,5
Pirelli > Ceat,6
Sam gives me Tom Holland vibes,8
"Looks a very innocent lad does sam curran, but when he runs in, very angry face",12
Dhawan should get his 100 here. It will be an even bigger slap in the face after dropping 3 catches.,8
DD are still 17 runs ahead at this stage (16 overs).,6
This has all the makings of a super dramatic finish,7
C'mon DC just lose. A man's bet his left kidney here if we win. You'll be saving someones life,9
Carey will play a gurkeerat and Dhawan will play a abd,5
Emerging player criteria- born after 1994. Fuck I feel old now.,6

Carey doesnt have to be flashy here just give it to Shika,8

goti muh me tha thodi der k liye,7

there is no fking way delhi is gonna loose this.,6
Wtf happened to Dhawan??!,2
Allowing Dhawan to get 80+ and bat till the 16th over is criminal...,3
Carey please don’t do a Shreyas I’ll pay you.,5
Dhawan swinging his bat like a skinnier Chris Gayle.,6
Hopefully Carey does a Kedhar Jadhav..,3
Okay so those extra 10-15 runs were for dhawan's century i get it,8
If it wasn't for Dhawan this would've been a terrible game from DC,9
"Curran and Karn beyond useless for CSK. Incidentally, both are pronounced the same way.",5
6 wicket win,2
Timing holy shit that was good.,10
Wtf? What a shot!,5
CSK = Choking Super Kings.,9
Uff Dhawan.,2
Both fanbases trying reverse jinxing lol,10
Oh my godddd Dhawan looks soooo good,9
"That was a top quality cricket shot, my god! A",6
What a shot🥵🥵🥵,8
Csk fans need therapy,1
What a fucking shot. It’s too easy for him,2
Dhawan baby❤,4
That’s the shot of the tournament imho,3
Gabbar won’t be stopped tonight,2
Prithvi shaw need to have some cough syrup for rest of ipl,2
come on dhawan don’t get out now PLEASE,3
He just checked that into the stands,3
MAN SOMEBODY MAKE HIM OUT,2
Rooting for a Dhawan century now,6
This is not the Dhawan i know. Holy shit,5
This is what CSK looks like when Curran isn’t carrying them,3
This is Gabbar's first six?,4
Dhawan can touch anything and turn it into gold right now.,6
"Csk so wholesome, no matter what Dhawan will score century",3
My goodness that shot was crisp,3
CSK ARE FUCKEDDDDD,3
God level batting,5
Shikhar is literally shitting on CSK.,5
Dhawan: We pant today,2
Allowing Dhawan to get 80+ and bat till the 16th over is criminal...,3
"Check shot 6, best 6",4
CSK would have won easily if we just fucking caught Dhawan,7
MonkaW,1
Wow what a shot. One of the best,3
Thanks Ponting for whatever you did to bring back ICC Dhawan,10
Well this is fun to watch ngl,2
N Paddikkal earlier was out of breath in his 20s,5
shaw waving the flag now,1
Dhawan maiden T20 ton incoming,3
"That shot made my pp tingle a bit, what a shot",3
Pure shagging that,3
I fap to this,3
Nervous nineties for Dhawan,3
"**Most runs for Dhawan against a team**

814* - vs CSK

733 - vs MI

**Most 50+ scores for Dhawan against a team**

7 - vs CSK

6 - vs RR, KKR",6
"CSK fielder on the boundary indicating that it was four.

 fIXiNg cONfIrMed ?",9
bhenchod,2
Mustache twist incoming.,8
Gabbar is back,6
Pure class from our opener.,2
There is no stopping Gabbar now.....,7
Thigh slap six,7
DREAM XI Game Changer this guy!!!,6
That should have been a no ball... Eh? Show the damn replay,12
Orgasmic,9
Thanks Dhawan. I came 3 times,13
ICC Shikhar in full flow.,10
CSK fucked,3
Don't want opponent opener to get a 100? Don't drop him 4 times.,5
Dhawan seeing it like a football here and now he is just showing off.,5
inexcusable that we dropped him 3 times. well deserved dc,2
That’s a no ball! Wtf,6
No ball,7
Love it when Dhawan is on song!,4
4 different players dropped Dhawan's catch. SMH.,7
NRR™,2
The only man who can stop Gabbar now is Thakur. We need Thakur.,4
Dhawan pissing on everyone who say he's not for T20s,5
"KKR fans, whom are you rooting for?",3
Don't jinx him guys ffs,10
Apology thread for Shikha Dhawa?,2
Just 9 more for the century,2
Dhawan will choke and not finish the game.,9
Runs Scored: 11,1
Faf giving that four will take CSK to the top of the fair play award table,5
Csk should start a bottle company with all these matches they keep bottling,5
"Mr Dhoni, I don't feel so good",6
CSK were 150 runs at 18.2 overs. DD are easily ahead by 8 balls.,3
Oh what could have been for us if we offered Dhawan more money,8
"Match khatam, paisa hazam.",2
That was a fucking no ball this time. Horrible,4
can't still win if they get him out this over pls,1
Dhawan is still not tired and playing with same energy after running so many ones and twos,6
not a good year to be a CSK fan. this is draining,7
"Lol so no no-ball there, but no ball when CSK batted.",10
On real time that seemed chest height. Even commentators were quick to dismiss it as not a no ball,1
Lara has had it with Swann's shit by now.,2
Thank you Dhawan for playing slow against us and smashing CSK.,5
Sam gonna curry,2
Bc that 6 from Dhawan!!,3
91(50) > 89(50). Just sayin... 🤷,4
"*Montage of drops off Dhawan being shown*

Commentators on Dhoni's drop: It was a tough chance

Commentators on other drops: That should have been taken",7
Too bad for CSK than DC isn't Punjab that will struggle to score an easy chase.,2
How guys were there Thakkur??,1
"We will def bottle this, now dhawan will get out, new batsman will be out missing a slog and carey will increase run rate aargh",2
CSK should be near the bottom of the Fair Play Table after what Dhoni did last game,4
Nicholas just came there lol,2
Dhawan drops one catch and gets three dropped in return. Buy one get three free.,5
they literally don't have a bowler who can get wicket now,2
Wish dhawan century irrespective of result,2
~~Indian~~ ICC Premier league- Dhawan,9
Shikhar playing like this just keeps reminding me of his WC injury😢,3
Ooh damn is that Ryan Harris?,2
"CSK need Dhawan’s wicket this over. If not, it’s over.",2
Delhi will lose this match.,-1
Dhawan with a class innings this,3
Just braindead captaincy bowling fielding from csk... having left arm spinners/pacers bowl to Dhawan... dropping three catches... #just csk things,2
Gotto say MSD in ads>MSD on field,8
I don't pay to get an ad every time I want to watch a replay,3
Super over anyone?,3
I will be very disappointed if people shit om Dhawan if DC lose this game. It has been an unequivocally terrific innings this.,6
Carey needs to take.some risks,1
Why are there lights on adjacent ground?,3
Wtf is carey doing jfc,1
That gun throw from Jadeja.,1
Carey specialist wicketkeeper that doesn't keep that good,3
"This isn't Carey's element, sharjah too small for his 2s",8
If Carey had more power on that shot it could’ve been 6 ngl.,2
This is going right down to the wire,3
C'mon a dot and a wicket is going to be incredible here.. prove your worth Shardul please,3
Carey is botching it. Should have sent Axar,4
Dhoni seems to be someone who's past years after his expiry date.,3
Whats up with KKR fans coming out of woodwork to shit on CSK? 🤣,6
"Conspiracy theory time - Dhoni was doing great up until before this season because Indian players were going easy on him, since he was still in the national team and had the ear of the selectors. Now that he's retired, everyone's going hard at him and showing his shortcomings.

I did not put any sort of research into this, didn't look up how Dhoni did last season, and I pulled this theory completely out of my ass.",2
Supporting CSK takes such a toll on my heart it's not even funny.,10
Carey is a fucking donkey.,1
We've gotta win this now,1
Dhoni seems to be someone who's past years after his expiry date.,2
Carey bro don't panic,3
That's not a dropped catch,3
hopefully thakur gets his revenge against gabbar,5
"What's with Carey, all he needs to do is take singles right now and he is trying everything.",1
Gabbar on strike.,3
Jadhav earning his big bugs with that save LOL,2
We want Alex Cary 2019,6
WE NEED CAREY ON STRIKE!!!?,3
Seems like yorker is the only way to stop Dhawan,7
Dhawan>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Shaw,7
"CSK are playing well under pressure, no extras, 1 run from prev 4 balls",8
Jadhav!,3
Jadhav fielding me b hagg rha,1
Dhawan 100 Delhi won by 6 wickets,5
Specialist fielder for a reason,2
Heytmyer > Carey any day,9
Someone wake carey up,5
Damn they’re hitting wides for 1.,4
Intern Cameraman is back,8
If only we had dhawan in wc semi final*,12
I have never seen Dhawan bat past the 15th over... Great innings and all but just fucking retarded from csk,10
Big full tosses working well.,1
Carey is in panic mode,4
"Haha, is Delhi throwing this?",6
CSK most certainly won't qualify if they can't pull this game off.,6
"If KKR is aiming for Top 2 finish, CSK should win here. CSK's win and KKR's win will make things interesting in the points table, and improve KKR's chances.  
(I am rooting for CSK in this match)",-2
"That would have been a wide, played straight to fielder, what luck haha",3
Bring axar in ffs,3
Jadhav diving on field to get screen time.,11
Carey needs to find a boundary now.,2
Alex Cary please don't fuck this up,2
Carey come on man it’s just Thakur.,3
Quality dive that,2
"Wear Masks, unless you are BCCI chief. In which case Wear Masks on Chin.",12
BC isse acha toh Axar aa jata,3
last ball acha dedo pls,2
Thakur is unironically good at the death,6
Come on Carey !!,3
Dhawan's highest IPL score is 97 iirc. He deserves a 100 today. Please don't let this be a jinx.,14
Good guy carey giving strike to Dhawan to complete his century.,2
छी,3
"You know that in times like these, positions like long-on need to be manned by elite athletes like Kedar Jadhav.",6
Every capped player should be ineligible for the Emerging player award.,8
I don’t wanna jinx but I want a thigh slap celebration tonight,9
Carey is mediocre AF,2
Carey is chocking the Oxygen out of this chase.,7
Bowl a dot please Lord Thakur,4
Who would have thought Thakur n Gabbar will play a cricket match together.,17
DC is not throwing this. The death bowling is pretty good by CSK. Credit where it's due,14
Yep match over,3
NICE BOIIII,2
Bitch ass what a shot,5
"Carey is not the finisher, Stoin is. Dont blast him please",6
"Fuck you chahar, Rayudu",3
"Dont let idli vadas win!!

/s",3
The match is CSK's. Don't think shikhar can carry it to the end.,4
AMAZON AD FUCK,3
A cliche but the 19th over is crucial this match. DC r favs,3
What invention from Gabbar,5
Not bad by shardul,2
Never expected this kinda innings from Dhawan,6
Gabbar is in god level touch today.,7
Highest IPL individual score for Dhawan,9
Shikhar keep it calm...,8
Dhawan is taking CSK on single handedly!,10
Imperial from Dhawan,8
Dhawan at his best.,5
Carey is the reason CSK is still in this game,3
Not the first WK that is struggling,5
Why do they talk about Shaw like he's Tendulkar?,10
bhenchod,3
Csk deserve to lose after dropping dhawan 3 times.,11
Bravo & Curran to finish off? Or a over from Jaddu?,6
scenes if dhawan gets out at 99 or something.. please no,6
"DC, please don't do a Kxip ..please don't !!",5
If CSK get Dhawans wicket they win,1
That sound of the bat though.,2
"Confession time, Dhawan was my favourite player in EA07",3
Dhawan is the only guy stopping CSK from victory!!,2
Shikha has schooled CSK bowlers ofc due to help from CSK fielders.,2
Man this is so close. Shouldn't have given us hope.,2
"Thanks csk for the close match and not gifting nrr, go thala nrr",5
Carey specialist wktkeeper,1
Jeez. Gabbar show. He got lives alright but he just bossed the bowling tonight,2
Could Axar be tried in place of Carey in last 4 overs? Don't think Carey is timing it.,2
Have there been centuries this year? I honestly don't even remember anymore.,3
Curran you are our only hope!,1
"Lol, Dhawan is toying the bowlers now. This is what will happen when you drop someone 4 times.",2
Alex Carey o_0,1
Shika the one,1
Dhawan's back to his best,1
Just don't drop catches it should be that easy,2
Dhawan usually gets out after scoring a 100. Just saying,2
"Honestly, without Dhawan, this would've been an awesome match for CSK, but it's just Dhawan's day today.",3
Shikhar 'Placement' Dhawan,2
Why don’t they bowl at the stumps when he is going to the edge of the crease to catch the wide yorker,1
few games ago people were calling for Dhawan tp be replaced by Rahane LOLOLOL,12
Carey is batting pathetic,2
[deleted],2
Thigh slap and moustache twist incoming in 3... 2.. 1...,1
Carey doing a Jadhav,2
Dhoni post match- well obviously we can’t drop catches and expect to win .,8
[removed],4
DC won't choke this one... Will they?,4
can CSK still qualify after losing this match? asking for a friend,3
"Time to remove Dotted mutual climax condom and finish this with climax, i hope csk has rape whistle ready.",6
Carey’s t20 record shows he’s not a finisher. Hopefully pant comes back next game,1
chud gyi csk.,3
How this mf stay not out in 90s so often wtf,8
Shikaari bhaiya pls stop,4
I forgot this Dhawan was dropped. XD,6
"Unbelievable shot, would have been out if he missed, but he's well set.",1
Dhawan fucking CSK mercilessly.,2
Jhadhav didn't have any opportunity to play or even field in any meaningful position and people are still memeing him as if he's the reason csk is where it is rn,3
He has 4 90+ scores,2
Get that 100 Gabbar !,3
"KL, Mayank, and possibly Dhawan now. So we can expect Rohit 100 soon too",3
I'm not confident about Sam Curran.,2
Why do they show so many ads in last overs?,6
Just in. Dhawan is now 4th highest scorer this season.,3
Lmao SAM FUCKIN CURRAN HAHAHAHA DC r def winning,2
Oh fuck Curran is on field,2
Big ass thigh slap incoming,2
absolute scenes if dhawan gets mankaded,9
Clenched,1
Honestly don’t care for what Alex carey is doing,7
Carey you dumbass,4
Why not Bravo this over?,3
Carey dimwit,3
Damn this could be Dhawan's first IPL century,8
"YES YES... 


But Dhawan on strike, NO NO",5
I get the vibes that DC may bottle this up. (Hope I'm wrong),7
Only faf can be trusted i repeat only faf,3
Is the next guy coming up better?,2
Thala Carey performed well for CSK tonight,5
Carey was eating bowls this should have been a strategic drop,6
"Good from carry, better than a dot.",1
What say Dhawan gets a century and loses his wicket with DC needing over 10 in the last over?,1
"Thank god Carey is gone, winning chance increases now",4
Get Dhawan or forget the trophy 😔,2
None of csk bowlers seem to have skills to execute Yorkers..slower balls and low fulltosses won't work against quality capped players like Dhawan,3
Hopefully the last time we see Carey in this tournament please,3
Carey and Rahane made 0 use of the opportunities they got.,4
subscribe for a super over anyone?,4
It's Curran F,3
Carey has looked lost every game he's played,3
Super Over?,1
Carrey played an absolute fuck-all innings,4
omg,1
"Hohohohohohohooooooo.....

I randomly missed Ntini, don’t know why.",2
"Oh come on, you just needed to stay Alex ffs why is everyone so keen in becoming a hero",2
You catch every batsman except the one that's scored 98 runs,7
Curran? Looks like MSD doesn't want to wait until the 20th over for the match result!,2
"Feel for Carey, absolutely feel for him. This was not his position he should have come when stoin did",2
A hattrick like you did for KXIP would be super nice now  Curran.,2
"Nooo, Carey was our man",1
Carey opens or doesn’t play.,3
Alex mushfiqur carey,3
"Carey, you ignorant slut!",4
Too close for my liking,3
Please god let CSK win,2
DC pulling a KXIP. Fuck me meme team plumbs new depths of chutyagiri.,1
"Carey been a passenger throughout, glad Pant is back next game and we can get Hetmyer back too",2
Makes no change to the game Dhawan whacks 2 6s and 2 4s,1
"Again, Carey is a fucking donkey.",5
Lack of Pant + Hetmyer really fucking us bad.,6
Too late,4
And it's Faf again. Jeez. does faf replicate himself at the boundary for CSK?,5
Dhawan out on next ball,3
What's wrong with Carey?,1
Seriously dude? Curran with his fucking pies gon bowl the 19th,3
Carey so unsure he didnt even swing full,3
Carey wtf,2
I guess Carey tried :(,1
Kal tatti nahi heere niklenge itna pressure hai gaand pe,4
"Alex ""Not sure what Aussies see in him"" Carrey",6
Terrible innings by Carey,5
"Sam Curran vs DC, PTSD intensifies...",7
"Good riddance i think, he was really out of sorts Carey...",1
Why don't fully go with the shots? Just chipping it air..  like wut,1
please get dhawan out,1
All the shouts for Hazlewood in for Curran looking kinda bad rn,1
Alex Carey not a finisher at all,3
Dhawan single lundedly focked csk. csk lubed him as well,3
The result isn't going to be different unless Dhawan goes.,1
Tahir just waiting for the players to take his drinks,3
Carey is so shit,3
"Curran over good unlikely, bravo may tighten things up but it seems like a gonner for csk",5
"**18.1** Curran to Carey, OUT,  **159-5**

AT Carey c du Plessis b Curran 4 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14",1
Is Curran really tall or everyone in CSK short?,3
"Thank God Carey is out, chances improved for DC now",2
Carey should be kicked out man. Useless for us.,2
Akshar Patel can do shit,0
This is where having Harshal Patel over Tushar woulda been nice,2
Why isn't Pant playing?,3
[deleted],5
"Hard to believe I'm saying this, but would rather have Axar in the middle in place of Carey",4
"Earlier today, people were blaming Smith of poor captaincy when he didn't bowl Archer in the 19th. Let's see",4
Alex “keeping out hetmeyer” Carey,7
CSK holding a press conference out there lmao,6
"Man idm if DC lose, but Dhawan's century won't carry any meaning in a loss. Really hope he takes them home",3
Putting all the pressure on dhawan.,2
"Carey did the right thing, no point in being there and eating balls.",2
Now it has become all important that Shikhar stays. Axar can wield the long handle. But it seems like the new batsmen are struggling on this pitch,2
Bring back 2019 wc Carey,3
Axar is better than Carey anyway though.,1
Should Tahir replace Bravo/Curran?,3
plot revealed: dhawan to get out after his 100,3
I heard CSK were losing so I came online quickly,4
"No Hetmeyer, no pant.",2
Csk will win this by 5 runs.,-1
"Carey has got to be dropped. Brings nothing to the team as a foreign player.

Delhi are better having a part time keeper than playing him.",3
I'm going bald thanks to CSK,1
Dhawan is literally carrying entire team. Please don't get out.,3
Can we have superover pls,4
I remember Carey batting better than this against India. Looks completely out of touch.,1
Australians have been sub par this IPL,1
It's unfair to ask Carey to bat at 6 and just go.,5
Finally a weak link in the Big3 of this IPL. Alex Carey.,2
Imagine Dhawan getting out here like Gambhir in 2011 WC final,0
"Remove Carey's innings and DC would need 25 from 18

Fuck this shit, bring back ma boi Hetymyer and Pant",6
Who all dropped the three catches of Dhawan btw?,2
Rest of team 61(56). Dhawan 98(53). CSK will rue the missed chances.,6
"Imagine if DC had Pant, Hetmeyer and Mishra",6
Sam Curran can't bowl at the death that was just lucky,4
Go back to old DC choke,0
"Don't wait till last over.

Should go for it now.",2
How the fuck are you playing IPL T20 and you can’t hit a full toss out of Sharjah? I don’t wanna see Carey back in the side even if Rahane has to keep,11
"I just made a post asking members to choose the better T20 batsman between gayle and ab. The mods removed it citing R7- low effort.

How is it low effort? It was an interactive post asking a perfectly legitimate question about cricket on a cricket sub. I'm writing this here because i've messaged the mods in the past about other issues and they were always unresponsive. If you're reading this, plz message me. I really want to understand what constitutes low-effort so that i'm more careful when I make another post.",7
Imagine being such a shit player you neutralise two in form batsmen from your team,5
Andre Fletcher is a better option than Carey,6
Super over anyone?,2
"Get Ngidi and Hazlewood back. I don't care if we sit Curran, or Bravo or whosoever. This is the most toothless attack ever. No proper fast bowler. All fucking medium pacers. Average spin attack without Tahir and Bhajji. Nothing intimidating about our bowling whatsoever.",4
So Dhoni is now dying his 1 inch long hair?,1
"DC fucked up by dismissing Dhoni & getting fucked by Jaddu, maybe CSK fucked up by dismissing Carey",7
How can you not fucking swing.  your bat with full power in a small ground like Sharjah. Carey can fuck right off the team. Shouldnt be near 11 anytime.,7
Why Axar not coming up in order.. he's good at short bursts,2
curran bro please lead us to victory,3
Goti in mouth,5
Dhawan please get out,2
Come on curran!,2
I can’t deal with a super over... pls finish this up,3
Rdj caught that,2
"This is the year for South Africans, sorry my carribbean brothers",11
Almost dragged on. He deserves a hundred seeing how many IPL nineties he has.,3
Dhawan was never in this position btw,3
Curran has a very strange action,3
Pant is really missed,4
Either DC choke and we cement our position at the top or CSK lose. Win-win situation,4
Curran 4 dot balls in a row if you count his previous over,3
YES MORE WIDES,2
DC Need to get the most out of this over tho. Bravo can bowl slower than Jadeja and it will be very hard to put away on this pitch,1
Ffs,1
I think the 7 balls Carey used up might have killed the chase.,2
Only Aussie performing well in this IPL is Stoinis.,1
Thanks Carey for getting Dhawan to panic too,2
CSK would've definitely won if not for the dropped catches smh,6
Are they really going to bottle this?,3
Is Bravo hurt?,3
Dhoni appreciating bowler woah,5
Dhawan should whistle podu as 100 celebration,1
Dhoni applauding like it was an Yorker on the middle stump,2
Just fucking bowl at the stumps ffs. Why do bowlers keep going for the wide yorker,2
bravo?,2
Has a crowd ever chanted *Shiikar! Shiikar!* ever?,4
do teen aur de de,2
He's setting up Dhawan I think. He's gonna bowl at the stumps next,4
CSK and MI slows down the game lot in crunch moments unlike other teams,2
we want dotted over,1
Ouchhh that doesn’t help,2
Don't mind losing this. Shikar get your century at least. One man batting line up.,5
I think dhawan wicket incoming.,2
Carey really needs to work on his big hitting abilities,2
Umpire now scared. Not looking at MSD by turning other side :),1
Umpire called a wide? Against CSK? What blasphemy,4
Guide us home Shikhar,3
"Kings XI Capitals

Kings XI Delhi

Delhi XI memejob

I'm telling you guys... They're gonna do that thing.",3
Carey has failed miserably with the bat so far. Hetmyer we need you!,5
Come on 3 dots,2
Good over by Curran,3
Free hit these for Axar. Just go for it.,5
"Faf has a word with curran 

Bowls a wide",8
looks like CSK’s game to lose tbh,7
3 drops for dhawan? Lol.,7
[deleted],-5
Dhoni appreciating the umpire for calling it wide correctly??!,6
No ball Curran come on I’ll pay you.,4
Good bowling and field setup from CSK. Considering Dhawans reliance on grounded shots.,7
"Faf has a word with curran 

Bowls a wide",9
Axar slogs to cow corner. York him.,2
don't let axer take singles,1
Axar is going to swing at it.,2
If Dhawan wins this it's absolute bonus as Dhawan is not finisher,15
Get him,1
Free hit for Axar!!,1
Would DD fans not mind losing this match just to keep CSK's hope alive?,2
Dhoni probably sees a Joginder in Curran to give him this over,3
need 2 boundaries here,1
Omg they are gonna bottle this,2
"Bowlers under pressure during a chase's death : Bowl wide Yorkers.
Batsmen : You weren't supposed to do this.",3
"after bravo, 5d chess by curran to distract dhawan with wide",2
will dhawan celebrate his 100?,1
Fuck DC bottled it,2
Should Dhawan celebrate after hitting his 100?,3
Dhawan take a single and score a century thanks,2
just 2 non boundary balls Daddy,1
CSK should have just stuck to wide yorkers from the beginning,2
"Alright folks, big hitting time. Wicket or six.",2
Please take a single for that 100 Dhawan. Please!!,3
Look at that Morgan smile lmao,6
If only Curran bowled his previous over like this,6
This is T20 cricket bhenchods.,3
"so many lefties, r/socialism would be proud",10
Ending the over with a boundary for sure,2
Just get Dhawan out ffs,3
So many left handers in this team,1
"Please dont mess up Dhawan, take your time to hit century, no hurry. They dropped 4 catches for you",7
CSK’s game to lose still,3
Curran is such a gun player,3
Yeah they messed it up. Too much to do,2
Bravo defiantly last over. He lives to bowl the last over.,3
Thala doing correctly what Smith fucked up the previous game.,2
Great over by Curran,1
Woahhhhhh,1
"Gabbar hitting at least one boundary in next 2 balls, effectively putting it out of csk reach.",2
"FUCk


Ok wait",1
Lol,-1
fk noo,2
Dhawan be like: opening bhi hum kre finish bhi hum kre?,3
Fuck my life man that’s out I heard it.,2
"quick DRS, so must be not out",6
"Fucking scenes! Please tell me this wasn't too late!

Edit : shoot me please",3
Omg out? On 99?,5
Lmao what was that shout,3
Dhoni pressure as usual.,10
Fuckkkkkk fuckkk fuckkkkkkkkkkking fuckkkk,8
yesss fucking lets gooo,3
Wtf,2
That wasn't bat was it?,5
Do they really have no one better than Axar,3
Kill me,6
"Ofc umpire had to give out when dhoni appealed, it's in the script (I think it's not out btw)",7
Lol,1
Being a Delhi fan isnt for the faint hearted,4
"Holy shit, Dhawan out at 99 😳",2
Hahahhahahha,1
Umpire playing fastest finger first,4
*Nervous Nineties*,4
Dhawan out wtf ?,3
I sense an umpiring fuck up incoming,8
That's out,3
omffifoffmfofmf,1
Oombu da Dhawan thevdiya!!!,0
Which team's winning helps RCB?,1
Highlights of MI vs KXIP may get uploaded to r/bdsm,7
Who said Curran couldn't bowl at the death?,4
Nooo. Shikar no!!!,2
"That's from the shoe, fk u umpire",7
It’s the same umpire that gave out on hitting the ground wtf.,9
"Dhawan, smh",3
"Irrespective of a wicket , a dot is so so valuable too.",3
This is why csk are on the top of the fair play award.,4
I hate being a dc fan ... the hope is too much,8
Don't think he hit it,5
Yes yes yes yes,1
[deleted],17
Bat on ground,3
Not out,3
Not out man,3
CSK were 163 after 19 overs. Lovely pullback by Sam so far.,1
"If Thala says out, it's out. No point reviewing. It's called Dhoni Review System for a reason",6
The umpire literally gave it out because Dhoni,12
THIS IS SAM CURRAN'S WORLD WE ARE JUST LIVING IN IT,4
Not out lmaoooooo,2
Nah. Gap between bat and ball,3
Not out. Bat hits ground,3
This is heartbreaking,2
Curran THE LEGEND!! Either way it's a dot ball.,4
Thats clearly not out. Are we giving stuff out because Dhoni yells.,11
Omg .. I know I support CSK.. but poor thing has never scored century...,5
He can breath easy. No where near it.,2
Umpires these days are more confident on dhoni than their own eyes and ears,9
Umpires are worse during a csk game.,15
"ultra edge, really?",4
Man fuck these bitch umpires. Dhoni appeals and they shit their pants. Bhag behenchod.,10
Daylight between bat and ball.,7
chutttad umpiring. is that close to bat?,5
C l i m a x,6
"""The ball is very close to the bat""  

Closer than the moon, yes.",7
Fuck how lucky is Dhawan today,9
Is the umpire scared of dhoni or what???,4
Not out that's game,3
Blind motherfucker.,1
Bruh not out,3
Curran has saved CSK from a loss I think. What an over,2
Is it out pls someone tell,1
Blind third umpire might give it!,0
"Not Out, Dhawan gets a lifeline",2
lmfao umpires making dumb decisions to benefit CSK yet again,2
"Nice and slow, that's what she said.",3
Thriller,1
"""Ball is quite close to the bat""",2
bAll iS vErY cLoSe tO tHe bAt,6
Still a dot though,4
Wtf is the umpire smoking?,4
F,2
Automate umpiring for IPL.,2
Dhoni influence,8
What a shitty umpiring,3
The dumbass thought a bottom edge went upwards lol.,5
Nikal dhoni pehli fursat me,6
"Phew, that not out!",2
Csk gonna win still.,3
That gap is yuuuge,5
Wtf is happening. I can't take this.,3
That was a Mushfiqur Rahim level appeal from Dhoni,12
That's a shocking decision by umpire,6
How and why did he give that out ffs,9
chutiya umpiring,11
What a spineless umpire,13
I think Stoinis playing that shot just after a six changed the game.,1
Trust your eyes. Don't depend on ultra edge.,1
Umpire is clearly wearing a CSK jersey underneath,8
Well I don’t wanna imagine what would’ve happened if there were no reviews,4
Useless time-wasting third umpire.,6
this DRS should be removed man,-3
BC umpire,5
Shit decision. Only encourages Dhoni to appeal strongly for no reason,4
Umpire Dhoni at it again,9
Literally only Dhoni appealed,6
Dhawan take a single century time,1
Dhawan using up all his luck tonight,5
"Be Dhoni, appeal for anything, get it either way",9
DC choked this :'(,4
When Thala asks for something he gets it /s,4
Too far away from bat. Not out.,1
"Come on DC, don't ruin my day more :(",1
OK last ball don't fuck it up please.,1
That's no where close to the bat. Umpires need to stop being so deep up Dhoni's ass.,4
Hahahhaa wow,1
Amazing over by Curran,3
I wanted to support CSK because it's better for RCB but I just can't. Go DC,7
Man this umpire is a joke,5
Dhawan's luck is still there,2
Dhoni pressure on umpire lol,9
Why dont they just start with the ultra edge?,2
DC gonna lose. Classic age old choke job this.,1
"Tendulkar can neither be created not destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another",4
Ah yes can we have csk and umpires as a joint unit on the fair play award,3
Imagine there was no review left. Disgusting umpiring,5
Alright Dhawan. Life gave you too many options. Don't fuck it now.,5
What's with the umps being scared of MSD?,6
Dot ball nonetheless,2
This has been CSK’s to lose since the beginning I damn well hope these two bring us home now.,1
He gave that out just based on Dhoni's appeal,6
"Why even have umpires in a CSK game!!

Let that old man in yellow decide instead.",11
CHawla bringing a giant towel for wiping that tiny ball.,2
He needed to see ultra edge for that?,3
Lol Curran didn’t even appeal. But Dhoni appeal? It’s out,3
just no SIx baby😰,3
These Ambanis keep buying umpires for csk so delhi can lose.,1
"What did Mark Nicholas say before this match ""outstanding umpiring""?",2
"Dhoni keeps his 100% appeal success percentage

Compared to 0% of PrabhSimran Singh",2
Is this the first time Dhawan stayed till 19th over?,4
Bruhhh! Dhawan century pls 🙏,1
Sam has bowled an absolute poison 19th over,3
Not even close to the bat wtf,5
IPL umpiring is so pedestrian that teams should get multiple reviews to counteract it,1
So umpires just take the decision based on Dhoni now,3
Please just 1 run,2
Dhawan out,2
"Styris said ""Dot ball Darcy"" was he referring to Darcy Short?",1
"Ok southie,you win.",2
Dhoni is the main umpire,2
"Kohli might be Koach, Dhoni is the umpire",3
Need a 6 this ball,1
Got intimidated by Dhoni's appeal 😂😂😂,3
Itna lifeline to KBC me bhi nai hota he yaar,2
"obligatory ""dhoni influencing umpire"" comment checking in",7
WHY FOLLOW DHAWAN JUST BOWL AT THE STUMPS,4
No wonder CSK get through the group stages so often with umpiring like that,5
That's a Transaction denied moment from the umpires,10
Chill lol there was a sound there. Can't blame Dhoni for this,12
"If MSD gets angry towards the display screen, does 3rd umpire need to reverse the not out decision?",20
tawliya wala chawala,4
third umpire to director ? *X files music intensifies*,9
"Raydu 45* (25): This is hosh

Dhawan 100* (57): This is josh",31
If DC lose from here will we still blame Dhawan ? No one really suppoed him tbh,10
"Dude, Umpire, m8, Boss, Anna, Thala - What you doing with such awesome umpiring?!",9
100 nice,6
100 for our very own Gabbar!,6
What a 100.,9
Who'll bowl?,1
17 off the last over ☹️,8
Shikhar you beauty!,4
😔🥺😢😭,5
Take a bow... Great innings!,3
Dhawan not celebrating,3
Dhawan's not celebrating :(,3
"What an over by Curran, pretty much sealed the game for CSK. His catching was also out of this world tonight.",8
Chad innings even after those chances,2
Umpire - I would rather give wrong decision and have it overturned than go against Dhoni,2
"**Most 50+ scores in IPL without a hundred**

36 - Gautam Gambhir

24 - Robin Uthappa

23 - MS Dhoni

19 - Dinesh Karthik

Before this it was Dhawan with 39. Well deserved Century !!",11
Gabbar [insert thigh slap],5
DC are so losing this :(,8
Moral victory,9
Well played dhawan!!,8
oh boi.,3
Great innings by Dhawan. Regardless of result this has been one of the best Delhi innings. He didn’t even celebrate.,19
"What a worse fucking time to get an 100, absolute mess",10
"Man, sikhar fought alone.",8
Ohh boy yeahh,6
Chutiya umpire gave it out because of Dhoni,10
God csk will win this,2
17 vs Bravo means CSK are favourites.,4
baby faced assassin was good,4
What an over by Sam Curran!! You beauty,3
Damn bro.... He just scored a century and can't even fully celebrate it.,9
Ffs Dhawan is still on strike.,2
Where is the thigh slap gabbar????,3
How are DC needing 18 off 7 balls? I thought the match would have been over by now.,4
The problem is that Dhawan is a classic cricketer and I am not sure if he can just slog the sixes.,2
Aiyo indha thevdiya laam 100 adikudhe!!,-2
Damn dhawan didn't even celebrated. Looks like he is focused to finish the job.,5
First 100 and can't even celebrate.,7
"Nice, now I don't care who wins",6
That no no ball call at 16.5 was big!!,3
Amazing over!!,2
This has to be one of the best chokes while being in cruise control mode for a long time. Pray DC fans!,5
Brilliant from Curran!,7
No celebration come on Gabbar,3
"Curran, win or lose, love your effort!💛",7
"Umpire looks at Dhoni, Doni appeals- It's out! Mfer umpires these.",6
imagine if we had Shikhar during the whole WC 19 smh im gona cry,5
No way they can get 17 of this over. It's done guys. Go to sleep. CSK's redemption arc is underway.,2
17 of the last over is too much imo. After all Dhawan's no Tewatia. /s,2
100(57) + 63(57),7
Dropped 4 times CSK! 4 times you deserve to lose so you fix your fucking fielding,3
Honestly Great over from Curran. Nice comeback from his previous over.,8
That might be one of the best death over I’ve seen,3
Does Bravo has an over left?,1
Csk wins but respect for dhawan,1
Well batted Dhawan. Kudos for 100,1
17 FROM THE LAST OVER 💦,2
Delhi seems lost at this point in this match,1
Excellent over from Sam Curran!,4
"Terrible over for DC, only 4 runs! They've lost it here.",6
"Wait, was the pre recorded clip chanting 'cheater cheater?",4
What a over. Just 4,4
If only someone would have stayed at the other hand to play a Jadeja like innings,4
"Doesn't matter what happens in the last over, that was one epic over by Curran.",2
Dhawan has batted on an altogether different pitch today.,4
6 singles would've been better than this. Fuck mate,3
"Who's for the last over, bravo not in field iirc",8
Vadakku thayolis rejoicing to this lucky 100,4
Great over from Curran finally but....,3
"Whether csk win or not, those catches cost csk badly",3
"Dhoni: appeals

Umpire: gives decision in favor of dhoni",11
Omg CSK still has this match. It's Bravo. This is better than sex.,7
"Is it necessary to always use the ultra-edge technology during a referral  like it is necessary to describe every six as “a cracking Unacademy six”? 

Reminds me of this https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/inmbh1/englands_drs_review_for_lbw_against_aaron_finch/",2
Dhawan please get retired hurt,1
kl dhawan...,6
"Class century, but that was unreal death bowling from Curran",5
four dots please thx,1
Those full tosses in last 2 overs are now haunting DC.,1
Dhawan bro being a team bro and not celebrating his 100.,3
"LOL. But initial replay looked like there was a deviation. But thank god we have DRS. 

&#x200B;

Congrats to Dhawan on a brilliant century in a tricky chase. Hope he continues on this torrid form. Why on earth did SRH trade him away looking at their indian batting talent !!!!!",6
Dhoni silliness,2
"Damn even CSK lose from here, Sam Curran bowled so well.",4
Great over from Curran,6
Poor Dhawan. Scores 100 out of a team total of 163 and he's still required to play the last over.,7
Jadeja what,1
AYE SHIKHAR YOU WERE DHAWAN UNTIL THAT,4
Wtf why Jadeja he got tonked,1
"Dhawan got no support in this entire match, he's legit batted through, whatta player 👏",7
CSK win,1
"Disappointed! no thigh slap, but awesome batting gabbar👏👏👏",2
Wow jaddu bowling ?,1
One man performance.,1
Dhawan didn't celebrate r.i.p next over bowler.,4
WTFF JADEJAAA,1
Jadeja over Bravo?,1
chutiya dhoni deserves it.,1
"As a DC fan, I want them to lose this game else all the liabilities will be hidden under carpet.",1
If that was Rahul he'd be taking his helmet off and going for a lap around the field to soak in the applause. Dhawan doesn't give a shit about anything but the game,6
Jaddu bowling to 2 lefties? Woah,1
What jadeja?,1
You are giving Jadeja the last over. Why.,1
"Jadeja wtf, I won't mind",1
Wtf happened to Bravo?,1
👏👏👏👏👏,1
17 off 6 from Bravo is a huge ask. He's so clever.,1
WTF! 😯,1
JADEJA,1
Serious question: Should teams get multiple DRS reviews? I don’t think time is a valid concern when integrities of matches are at stake tbh,3
Bravo show them who's the champion,1
Yeah. Bravo is chilling.,2
Bravo off the field. Oh dark.,1
"Great innings by Shikhar, unfortunately it doesn't look like he has enough left in the tank to get Delhi through.",3
3 sixes to finish it off pls. Thank you.,0
Curran keeps coming good in pressure situations!,3
Bravo's eating popcorn lmao,7
Dhoni trying to play a joginder sharmaesque card here,5
"Lovely over!!! Both teams are at 163 after the 19th over. 

CSK had edged over DD given how their last over went.",1
people whining about a 100(57) innings. really? what about his teammates?,8
The beauty of being an allrounder. Sam Curran redeemed his day with that over.,2
"Dhawan i swear you get this over the line, Shaw ko ground ke 10 chakkar nahi lagwaye toh dekhlena",7
Spit in my opening dick hole wtf,1
"Interesting choice here, let’s see how it goes",2
"Bravo my man, pls, I beg",1
Jaddu?????? Not bravo???,3
Is bravo injured?,2
Wtf,1
Man's carrying the rest of the team in his backpack.,4
Hope this first 100 in t20 was worth it.,2
Wtf,1
Karn Sharma to bowl the last probably,1
"Binga: So I was watching a movie last night .. ""Escape from Alcatraz"" and...

Swann: ALTROZZZZZZ Gold Standard in its class",7
OH NOO,1
Lmao which wicket keeper won't appeal that? I swear people here will blame Dhoni for everything.,2
CSK move to 4th damn!,3
Congrats Dhawan,1

Holy shit Axar well played shikar too,3
Axar is underrated af.,2
Why Jadeja and not Bravo?,2
That was kinda anti-climatic,2
Lost in the fielding,3
Axaarrrrrrrrr the destroyerrrrrr,5
CSK's fielders deserve the Dream11 Gamechanger Award today,6
Axar 🙌,3
Retarded from Thala. No defending this. 17 of the last over should have been defended,8
That kid in the balcony 😂,7
Patel patel,4
Virgin Dhawan 101 (58) vs Chad Axar 21 (5),21
And Dhawan. Please go and hug Jaddu now.,5
Baffling captaincy but I'm not complaining hahahaha,6
MANNNNNNNN AXAR PATEL,3
F for CSK,3
Dhoni match fixer?,-5
Well played dhawan. But Csk were so unlucky. Bravo would have ripped these two apart,0
Axar holy shit my guy o7,10
Dhobi to be trolled till death now lol,13
Bravo is prolly injured guys calm down,9
Someone please tell me what was dhoni saying to jadeja.,10

Lol GMR owner stopping his son from jumping off the railings in excitement,19
"Dhawan **BOOM BOOM**ed on the field, will probably **BOOM BOOM** off the field tonight too.",10
So Jadeja is the Jadeja lite now,15
420SR LMAO,14
Shit head move by Dhoni. Bravo should have bowled the last over. What crap..,7
Big choke.,5
Dhoni and Smith trying big brain moves which failed massively today,8
"DC just has another match winner
Omfg DC wouldve won even if the target was 24+",4
Today was a good day,11
Hahahahaha get fucked CSK,13
that kid was more exited than dhawan was after scoring his first 100,12
Carey getting out was the biggest blessing,8
Back on top where we belong!,6

Axar took revenge for Vizag. Lmao wtf.,16
"Did the kid in the owner's stand just yell ""f**k you""??",11
Brain dead decision from Dhoni. Something kohli would do,6
Damn Axar,6
Can someone explain why jadeja bowled the last over?,2
[removed],14
Friendship over with Tewatia. Axar is my new lord now.,20
Dhoni what did you do,6
Budget Jaddu destroyed real Jaddu,31
Axar > Sobers,9
Both matches were ended in STYLE with a SIX,9
"What did dhoni think, this move will pay off like 2007 finals and he will be called a genius and a out of the box thinker?? Brain dead move when there are 2 left handers on the crease and bravo has an over left

Edit: bravo was injured and I didn't know that, despite that I take my stand give the over to a leggie who was bowled 3 overs rather than jaddu who bowled one over and wasn't brought on cuz of the left hander threat",2
Bowling Jadeja at the death to Indian batsmen who can play him at will....,7
Two brilliant matches,6
Feckin get in... AXAR You beauty!,4
Really bad call by Dhoni to bowl a spinner,1
Don’t see bravo on the field,3
Axar just hit 3 sixes casually? Have I been underrating him all the time? Unbelievable indeed swanny,14
Axar finally gets his revenge. He was smacked by Dhoni for 4 sixes when he scored 25 runs for Pune to win in the last over.,10
Bravo got injured? How is this Dhoni's fault?,8
Axar was feeling insulted by Dhoni bowling a spinner turning the ball towards him in the last over,14
Vijay Dahiya's incessant praying by kissing his rings had worked.,3
Great game really!,1
Kohli giving chahal 18th. Smith to Unadkat and now MSD to Jadeja,8
"Man Delhi have such a well rounded squad, its insaane",5
"CSK, no shame in losing to the table toppers.",7
Bravo would have given away 5 runs lol,2
Axar did a tiwatia,5
Dhoni dropped the season with this masterstroke,8
"Who tf bowls a spinner in a mini garden, in the last fuckin over?",14
Azar Patel got his revenge,5
What happened to bravo,3
"Axar Patel dashing all remaining hopes of CSK😂😂👍🏽Good job DC. Gn guys, have to sleep now. What a match!! Love you guys so much Muahhhh😚😚😘. r/cricket is great way to express your emotions. Thank you so much guys and gals😭❤️ Will see tomorrow 👍🏽",5
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY OF CRICKET,3
Buddho Dhobi,0
"I was screaming at my lungs when Dhawan took that single, however Axar you beauty",7
Axar: Parkour,4
"What a masterstroke by Dhoni. Not bowling your specialist death bowler, Bravo.",8
That last six by Axar was one of the biggest I've seen,7
AXAR YOU BEAUTY!,5
Sir Jadeja giveth and Sir Jadeja taketh away.,5
This is it this is it this is it! This is our year boys!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"Dhoni Tata, khatam, goodbye",10
"Dhoni has gone to gutter: his mind, his form, his attitude, his stature, his reputation . Everything.

You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain",11
"Dhoni to Jadeja before the over: you scored the runs, you save them",7
Bringing Joginder Sharma to bowl the last over is a genius move because IT WORKED,17
"RCB wins

Csk looses

Dhawan scores a century

AbD puts on a show like only he can

What a fucking day!! 2020, thank you for atleast giving us this day.  I missed IPL!!",25
CSK out of tournament I am so happy today,7
Did Bravo go off before Curran's over?,3
"Clutch knock by Axar- 15 off 5 was hard, even against Jadeja.",1
Suck that idli vadas,1
Axar Dhoni'd this right in front of him,10
Wow what a match!! Axar fucking snatched it all away,4
Dhoni missed the trick by not bowling jadhav,3
Is Bravo injured or something?? If not this loss is squarely on Dhoni's head...,4
Should have bowled jadhav just for the memes...,8
"So, who had their bets for matchwinner on Axar?",2
Fuck yes,6
Now we know where Koach gets his crazy ideas from,6
"Big gamble from Dhoni, going to Jadeja with 2 left handers at the crease, didnt work out.
Edit : Apparently Bravo not fit according to Dhoni, went off the ground. So his choices were Karn Sharma or Jaddu.",5
The best captain India ever had decided to bowl a left arm off spinner in the last over to 2 lefties on the world's shortest ground 🤷‍♂️,10
"Great game! See my Royals, that’s how you close a game.",3
"I cordially resign from the csk fandom, fuck you dhoni, bye",2
"DC CHASED CSK out of the tournament, big yikes",2
Redemption for axar. Remember what thala did to him in the last over 3 yrs ago...,7
They literally showed Bravo resting on a stretcher,8
"If csk wins: Dhoni mastermind to give Jadeja last over.

if csk loses: Jadeja is trash",7
Fuck,2
"Axar really deserves a place in Indian team, at least should consider",2
Only 7 out of 7 wins left now!,7
This is like that 2015 match when Dhoni fed Negi to young Hardik for 19th over.,4
"Dream XI game changer: Friendship ended with Dhawan, Axar is my new best friend.",7
[removed],-6
"I said this before too, Axar deserves a chance in the national team again.",3
Why are people questioning the decision? Bravo was injured and off the field. It was either Jadeja or Karn.,10
"Lmao, So people were bashing Smith for that Unadkat's decision. Wonder what they think about Jadeja-on-20th over masterstroke",4
I say this often but I love this Delhi team,6
"Could've at least bowled Shane Watson, or even Kedar Jadhav's round armers. Why a left arm spinner against two left hand batsmen?",6
They fucking did it!!!!,8
"This top 2 rivalry is getting tiring, cmon Mumbai lose already",8
Lol that was Gilchristesque,6
"Epic finish. Dhawan 100, axar cameo.",8
I would have sucked Watto's dick for him to bowl the last over instead of Jaddu,3
"2 left handers and left arm spin last over, what could go wrong",2
Axar returning the favor from 23 run over that Dhoni did,3
[deleted],1
"Yes! Thanks DC for the win. I look forward to the post match interview with Rabada, he's such a good interview or at least I hope they interview him.",3
"Cricinfo

>Questions will be asked: why Jadeja to two left-hand batsmen?

Nah, no one will question Dhoni and you know it",9
Hahahaha,1
"Sheer unlucky that. To have Bravo injure out like that.

This season simply isn’t for CSK this year.

Season pretty much over . Just go through the emotions and maybe can give youngsters like Jagadeesan and Gaikwad a chance",11
"I’m sorry , someone pinch me, are we....clutch ?!!",7
these guys :')),2
Sir Jadeja on the other hand has successfully negated his efforts with bat,8
"Before 2020: MSD is captain cool, expert tactician, best finisher of the game

2020: All of the above \* -1",13
Koach vs Smudge vs Thala for worst captain of ipl 2020,10
Man I was literally shitting myself during the last over,7
this game was watchmojo’s top 10 ways to throw a match,10
"Words I learned in 2020- Quarantine, Brain fade",8
Pathetic performance by CSK they are exactly where they belong on the table,8
Lmao that kid,5
"**BYE CSK, KXIP, RR**",3
"DC and RCB in top,  that's 2020",6
That Kid must have gone through heaven and hell to celebrate like that,9
That kid is my spirit animal for today,5
Axar really didn't have to do him like that. This dude really just walked out the dugout no fucks given like imma smash these.,8
"Don't cry because csk lost. Smile, smile because Pant did his thing behind Ponting during interview :)",11
Dhawan should have a party to celebrate his first IPL hundred(that too in a winning cause) and only invite Axar to it,9
Old uncles got cucked by youngsters,9
Atleast rr lost against abd...,8
Chole Bhature has beaten Dosa.,11

Is this game over for CSK?,2
Wtf happened at the final over?!,4
Ye teri aankhein jhuki jhuki,2
"Axar 21* (5) holy fuck

S.R 420",8
Sam Curran is our player for the future we must retain him also jadeja regardless of his bad exploits in bowling today.,9
Incredible comeback. Axar bhai hats off. Shikhar what an innings. A match to remember.,2
"Dhoni had chased 23 from Axar over

Axar returning the favor",12
Reminds me of this one time in college when captain gave his buddy noob bowler the last over and it was over in a couple balls.. all others felt stupid for playing the first 39 overs lol,6
"Axar >> CoolDeep

What a match. What an innings under pressure.",4
"Jaddu scored 33 off 13 balls and 

gave away 35 off 11 balls.",9
Lmao that kid saying fuck you with his dad right behind him RIP,9
"We can leapfrog to 5th with a win tomorrow. And we dont have thr worst record against MI 🤞

Couldve been at 10 points already 🥺 but i ll cry about it later",6
"How the frick will csk go to play offs now?
Do they have to win all their next matches??",5

Jadeja be like Bitches my score is just - 2.,0
Left handed spinner to Left handed batsmen when bravo had one left. Suspect as Fuck. I am out.,0
Honestly even Jadhav could have been tried. Jadeja was the worst fucking option,5

Hope people see thru this fraud Dhoni now,4
"Tbh, Jadeja should’ve switched sides fired it into the pads buuuuut no Bravo, what ya gonna do.",4
"you think these guys would learn to not bowl a spinner in death overs by watching rcb, but nope",8
Gabbar flexed,8
I cant handle this trauma,11
Pure power that by Axar. What clean striking!,5
"If KKR WINS tomorrow , top 4 are almost done.",7
Dhawan deserves MOTM but Axar bowled really well and basically won the game from a losing position,8
wait bravo wasn't available? bc ek over daldeta lol,6
F for Jadeja and MSD for facing the upcoming memes,8
[deleted],-12
Whats with all this hate for Csk ?,-1
Dhoni just got Out Dhonied by A X A R,7
God! Bravo was off field so he couldn't bowl. Why so many shitting on Dhoni? The only other option was Karn sharma,17
"Damn I missed Bravo injury. Well played Axar Patel, it's still Jadeja bowling and he made very easy work of it.",3
Axar was fabulous. Dhawan was something else.,7
"Both the captains, Dhoni & Smith, shitting their beds today in the final 2 overs",9
"Bhhhennnnchhoooooodddddddddd , sorry, just pent up energy since 2008. I BELIEVE in this team.",21
"If srh lose tom and kxip win, kxip is gonna be fifth lmao.",4
Tight match but well done Axar in the last one,2
Dhawan celebrating century after winning <3,12
Bravo was injured. It was either Jadeja or Karn. Get your facts before just bashing Dhoni,18
Oh my God Bravo still had one. This was a disaster from MSD.,-6
"When your time is up, you're usually the last person to know.",10
"Captaincy blunder by Dhoni tonight. Didn't rotate bowlers well enough. Didn't try Jadhav. Imagine the scenes if Kohli was captain. But because Thala is there, no one will talk about captaincy.",0
CSK... choking again !!!,8
"Kohli stayed away from doing any 5D chess plays and we won, while Smith and Dhoni tried them and lost",9
"In case anybody forgot, Axar’s bowling RR today was about 4.5 while every one else was higher than 8.5 in DC, great work by him",23
"After lord Tewatia, bow to lord Axar",14
"There are two ways KKR can get in playoffs
1.A miracle
2.mi dc and rcb beats every team and kkr beats srh tomorrow",9
"Hot damn son, the sound of the bat connecting with the ball on that last six. WoooooooooHhhhh",11
Even Kohli wouldn't bowl Jadega here,3
People aren't even watching the match here & just came to bash Dhoni wtf they have clearly shown Bravo is out of the field,33
"Fellas Bravo wasn't on the field, maybe injured?",9
Bravo was not fit. Oh. that is tragedy,10
So Bravo was injured. The decision makes slightly more sense now.,12
Is CSK out of the tourney now?,2
This is the best way to beat CSK and kick them out of the tournament!,10
Ohh bravo was injured. That makes sense. Sorry dhoni,16
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",16
Dhoni looks freaking depressed oof,15

If bravo was available easy win for Chennai,9
Axar madlad with 400+ strike rate .,10
Jaddu giveth Jaddu taketh,17
It’s actually crazy to think that Dhoni and his team got all the time in the world to slow the game down in the last two over and still got fucked by Axar Fucking Patel,14
Axar just changed from Jaddu *lite* to Jaddu *Pro Max*,12
[deleted],-2
Axar Patel has cleared his demons against Dhoni today,11
"Man this sub is going to have a field day after this. Feeling little sad for CSK fans tbh. Bros, this is just cricket. Someday you win, someday you lose",7
Axar just destroyed 3D strategy of CSK.,7
At least Bravo was not forced to bowl.,3
Thala became thoka,6
Axar didn't even celebrate much so that Dhawan gets the limelight for his century,8
Even with the slowing pitch. Anything under 200 is not a safe total at Sharjah imo,6
"It kinda sucks that Hotstar doesn't show losing captain interviews, have to switch to hindi cable channel to catch that",2
The main positive from this game is that this was Kedar Jadhav's best performance in this season.,14
Cricbuzz says Bravo was not available. What happened to him?,4
"This is the redemption of Axar Patel after 4 years against MS Dhoni & team. Dhoni smashed 23 runs in the final over in IPL 2016 and 4 years later he smashed 6,6,2,6 vs Jadeja and helped to win Delhi Capitals.",19
"Take a bow Shikhar, what a century",9
Axar second coming of Bevan confirmed?,7
I really feel for the fans of the losing sides today. But GODDAMN what a great day of cricket this has been.,9
Is this the end of road for CSK? Can they still make it to playoffs?,5
"CSK will have to depend on other games’ outcomes more, it’s not just their games anymore it appears",9
The kid on the balcony needs to chill the fuck out. What a brat,-7
This really shows what kind of talent Narine has. He constantly bowls in the death and even set batsman find it tough to hit him,11
Dhoni giving credit to opposition. That’s rare,5

Bravo was unfit. It was an okay decision. But Jaddu bowled wrong lines. He should have wide length balls.,1
Bravo's injury cost CSK the match,3
Axar definitely worked on his batting in last couple years. He never was this threatening when he played 3+ years for KXIP.,9
Delhi-Mumbai Finals let's gooooooooo,13
So CSK out of the game now ? Or is there any chance for them to bounce back in playoffs,8
"Chahal bowling the 17th over for RCB, Unadkat bowling the 19th for RR and now Jaddu bowling the 20th for CSK to two left handers...all in one day.
Dhoni now saying Bravo was injured but not sure when they knew....prolly should have had Jaddu get one in earlier.",5
I think only positive from this team is Sam. He did so well.,9
I can't believe it,2
"Wonder why dhawan didn't celebrate the 100 to the fullest, would've loved if he did :/",13
Bravo was not fit? What could've possibly have happened to him the span of 5-6 overs?,2
"Bro that kid, love it!",7
Dhoni single handedly put CSK out of their misery. I think he has lost a few players today especially Bravo and Jadeja. Poor Jadeja. I feel for him.,-1
[deleted],0
"Should Axar be MoM? Give him some award, please.",7
Rohit was right now everybody will win chasing it.,12
Hahaahhaha not many better sights in cricket than watching CSK lose... Made my day,10
Dhawan's six against Curran was a little bit of redemption for dropping Curran in 2018 in the first game when Curran eventually hit a 50,6
Can't see disappointed Dhoni even if I support DC,4
"If CSK had won it in the last over,  they would have called it match fixing..since DC won its all fair and square",1
"If delhi won't win cup this season ,its a CRIME.",11
I feel bad for hating on Axar at the start of the season,6
Could've bowled Watson if Bravo was injured? What was the last time Watson bowled?,4
Bravo was not fit? What could've possibly have happened to him the span of 5-6 overs?,8
Though luck. hope DC wins the IPL this year instead of MI,13
Shreyas gave tips to axar to hit sixes. He is the best finisher ever. Dhoni must have forgot to turn on his tips mode on.,7
"That kid is every DC fan, being bogged down by failures year after year and finally it's his time.",25
Bravo was not fit? What could've possibly have happened to him the span of 5-6 overs?,3
"Axar Patel with a strike rate of 420

Nice",17
CSK playoff chances looking weaker makes me more happy than dc winning!! Finally some other team will face MI in the finals.,5
"It looks like every other team wants to keep KKR at 4th position, except KKR.",45
Jaddu is a shit ipl bowler imo. Might as well that useless duck kedar over him.,-10
Well maybe you shouldn't have batted first then Dhoni,-7
"So, with CSK, RR, KXIP out of the tournament, RCB are pretty much guaranteed a playoff berth.

Real competition is between SRH and KKR now",18
Bravo was injured probably as he was of our of field  but when did it happened,5
[deleted],-20
"Jadeja with bat 33*(13) 4 Sixes

Jadeja with ball 35*(11) 3 Sixes

**Ravindra Jadeja in the 20th over today**

With the bat - 15(5)

With the ball - 22(5)",38
Thigh slap victory lads,6
"Lmao, what did he even answer 🤣 question about running out of games and Thala giving speech about Curran's yorkers 🤣",3
"Guys, BRAVO WAS INJURED! They showed him lying in the dressing room. Dhoni wasn't trying to be clever. He only had 2 options to bowl(Jadeja and Karn Sharma) and Sharma was expensive",17
[deleted],-1
"Axar : call an ambulance, but not for me",23
Dhoni's gonna get trolled again on Twitter,8
We have won 2 out 3 with such a weak batting line up! We are not losing anything after this if we drop Shaw.,8
"**MS Dhoni \| Losing captain:** Bravo was not fit, he went out and was really not able to come back. That was the reason we had to bowl (Jadeja). The option was between Karn and Jaddu so I went ahead with Jaddu. Maybe not enough.",14
Axar Man of Match,5
Just one step away from playoffs with 6 games to play. I can't stress how unusual this feeling is as Delhi fan.,10
"DHONI - Bravo was not fit, he went out and was really not able to come back

r/cricket really sucks only watch scorecard & came to bash dhoni",20
Hahahhaha jeet gaye!,3
Everything going in KKR's favour but they keep bottling the chances. We are lucky enough to be in top 4. Hope we win tommorow.,6
Pic incoming: Dhoni giving pep talk to whole of DC sqaud except Shikar and Rahane,29
Well that's the disadvantage of playing all oldies. Anyone can get injured at any time and the team has to pay the price.,19
Kedar Jadhav didnt bat didnt ball why he was in the team?,12
So is csk officially eliminated?,6
Brilliant ton from Dhawan. DC totally deserved that victory.,17
Horrendous length bowled by jadeja in the last,6
Let’s celebrate 17th Oct as brain fade day,13
"Jaddu gives, Jaddu takes",13
"**Dhoni**

''Bravo was not fit. It was either Karn or Jaddu. We gave too many chances to Shikhar. The wicket behaved slightly better in the second half. There was just enough dew to create a difference''",16
Axar -> one bits & pieces player shredding another one,9
[removed],-29
After all these years people have turned on MS Dhoni like nothing before,12
This was KXIP levels of choking from CSK. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT,21
Why doesn't Kedar bowl anymore? He is a specialist fielder who is not even good at fielding atm,15
Axar's strike rate is 420 🌚,77
"Dhawan - 101 off 58

Axar - 21 off 5

Everyone else - 63 off 56

These two massively overperformed",77
Patel Power!,6
Dhoni's decision to go with Jadeja ahead of Karn is rational I think. He thought those fast darts outside the off stump would be difficult for a new batsman but Lord Axar has arrived and put Jaddu down.,14
Well so that's the nail in the coffin then. See you next season. GG Delhi,16
"Who remember [this RPS vs KXIP](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/scorecard/981005/rising-pune-supergiants-vs-kings-xi-punjab-53rd-match-indian-premier-league-2016) match when Dhoni scored 25+ in last over of match against Axar Patel? 

Revenge has been taken",46
Axar Patel bowled beautifully and finished off the match for DC. What a gun player!,14
"Unlike all 'quality' innings at Sharjah,  this one from dhawan is class apart, he played the fielders, rotated the strike, found gaps and kept himself calm.  
Batting of high order",86
I just realized that Pommy and Stoinis are both from Zimbabwe,8
Never thought I would see CSK not making it to the Top 4,17
"This is 2016 T20; world cup final all over again, everyone expected Samuels to get the job done then brathwaite came out of nowhere",15
"**IPL2020**

bravo was unfit. bechare dhobi ki faltu me mar li r/cricket ne.,2
"Somebody called Axar a budget Ravindra Jadeja in the first match thread of DC vs KXIP

Axar defo read that before coming to bat today",60
"Csk of last 2 years would not have lost this, even from the last two overs. It's just not their year.",11
"Chasing teams winning, close games, Unadkat screwing up - is this still 2020?",11
"Dhoni is a gambler. sometimes he wins, some times he doesnt. Joginder Sharma worked, Jadeja failed...",19
Watto should have tried and bowled😔 this was sad game was done as soon as I saw Jadeja,11
Someone should show a pair and ask Dhoni about Kedar's place in CSK XI,5
"Bad fucking luck csk, no bravo no playoff",5
Just drop shaw and get pant atleast now lmao,1
WTF DC lost points in NRR,4
[deleted],7
Focus has been on MI but what a tournament DC is having. Qualifier 1 is going to be lit if it is going to be DC MI,11
RR should find some consolation after this match to keep their hopes alive,4
Axar returning the favour few years ago dhoni hit 20 odd of his over to win it for his side.,30
Where tf is Rabada. We don't want Stoinis's interview. We want RABADA,6
"DC still getting over the line with Rahane and Carey is good for them - when Pant-Hetmeyer return, they will be even more dangerous",11
"That wide really fucked up Jadeja, was clearly a fair delivery & forced Jadeja to bowl it closer to the batsmen.",-9
"If MI is taken care off this season, we'll have a team other than them and CSK winning this IPL",7
People will say CSK were unlucky as Bravo was injured. But this is where a team pays the price of choosing oldies,17
Stop talking about Dhoni. Let's freaking appreciate the arguably greatest innings this season by Dhawan.,30
Today's both matches has been won by the chasing team. Nice to see the change,11
If bravo can't play i am seeing a chance for santner or Hazelwood coming soon,9
Tough luck for CSK with Bravo not being available. I remember he somehow managed to defend 8 runs in the last over in that 244 game.,16
Even the 10 year Delhi boy couldn't hold his *behenchod* .... I think I have tears of happiness in my eyes.,51
KP’s wife called him back after seeing his chemistry with Neroli Meadows,16
Do people here not watch the actual match? Or just check score?,2
"Need Pant back, can't be carrying two dead weight players in the crucial stages",15
"Dhawan plays for team and according to situation and not for orange cap  
He has been champion performer at icc tournaments",22
"Honestly csk giving 4 chances to Dhawan closed the game, it's almost impossible to have an unbeaten centurion and lose a chase where rrr doesn't go above 36",19
"Let’s take a moment to recognize Curran’s wonderful 19th over. One of the best I’ve seen, to defend against a near-centurion like he has is pure awesomeness",29
"Who’d have thought that we would win 7 in the whole tournament , let alone 7 in 9.",23
Koach ffs don't bowl Chahal in the death,11
[removed],8
">Also the wicket played better in the second half.


Just no MSD",12
SRH and KXIP should win tomorrow so that race for 4th spot remains a 5 horse race. Want to see a team making playoffs with 10 points. SRH made it last year with 12 points.  MI losing would also keep RCB in contention for top 2 spot.,14
I hate watching DC play because it keeps reminding of the fact that we let go of Stoinis and bought Finch instead.,10
"Axar ""Winged Hussars"" Patel",7
"What we know:

 - Shaw should be dropped
 - Carey should be dropped",12
Here I was cursing Axar for not taking a double to give strike back to Dhawan,12
"Shaw started this season good, has hit a dry patch. Needs to redeem himself now",6
Sucks Bravo wasn't there.,5
Somebody make post match,4
"“Ae Munday Dilli kay, haan khelein front foot pe”

T: These boys from Delhi, they’re aggressive (play on the front foot)",12
Where is post match thread,7
"Guys, please report abusive comments instead of engaging w/them",13
What is this shit I'm hearing? Dhawan got dropped thrice!?,17
ngl DC got lucky today. Their top order has to improve.,19
Catches win Matches... Period...,8
Really want either rcb or dc to win this year,20
"Yo wtf, why isn't Sanga on Dugout?",9
Fielding lost the match for csk honestly. How does a guy gets dropped 4 times?,14
"Yes SRH fans, that’s the Dhawan who used to play for us",31
I am so late in Dhoni bashing thread.,7
Dhawan literally played all around the park. Great innings despite the chances,8
Dhoni it's time to burst the bio-bubble like your retirement mate,9
"Yes Dhoni made a stupid decision. “Bravo isn’t fit and unable to come back to bowl”. Well, in that case, 16th/17th over should have been Jadeja/Karn.",13
Dhoni still has a lot to learn about captaincy.,13
"Can't even hate. DC were the better side. Good on you axar, mate",16
Twitter's a shitshow right now,17
"Ravindra Jadeja tonight:

With bat 33 Runs in 13 Balls

"I'm just waiting for the ""Hurr durr Dhoni gets so much hate for no reason"" comments",11
"Dhawan and Rohit should only open in limited overs, have played together for years and intent is always there",13
Super striker to Jaddu?? WTF. Disrespectful to my mans Axar,23

"Once Dhoni smashed 3 sixes against Axar Patel to win the match in the last over. Now, Axar repaid all of it. xD",18

not even happy with that victory man. Lot of impostors in that batting order. we got lucky today.,5

CSK fans now have to make calculations to see how they can qualify. How the turntables...,31

But KKR is not showing any intent to qualify, while other teams are pushing KKR to be at 4th position. I hope they take things seriously, and not take things for granted. Hope they sort things out and make a big comeback, because the team is really good - just the players are out of form and no single player has performed consistently till now. Fingers Crossed, hope for the best.",23
"But how in the world did that ump give Dhawan caught out, when there was clear daylight between bat and ball.",31
Sunny and Kumar are not looking happy. They both picked CSK before the match but Delhi had other ideas.,25
Sunny G talking about CSK’s team composition,10
Dhawan was dropped 4 times. Sunny G claims only one of them was challenging and the rest were fairly straightforward. Guess who dropped that one?,37
"Boy dhoni is gonna get quite the hate now, gotta check them insta comments regularly",15

That's some shit batting,  isn't it?



Edit:  DC had just 27 dots in their 20 overs!!!",26
"I think csk just doesn’t have the team tbh this season. No proven batting backups and bowling being too overcrowded with leg spinners. Their ploy of making a team which suits the Chidambaram stadium and focus on winning those 7 games has backfired this time. Even if they drop Watson and Jadhav, they have Gaikwad and Jagadeesan who just don’t inspire confidence but tbh, they can’t be worse than what we are seeing rn. Get in hazelwood and Tahir, drop Watson and bravo. Remove karn Sharma, get in a batsman like jagadeesan and the team looks instantly better",11
I can now resonate with the 'waqt badal diya jazbaat badal diye' pakistani guy,11
Csk and Dc fans in the last over : Bravo!! Bravo!!,19
"What the hell is wrong it's like most people comment on this thread only based on result without watching the match. Bravo was injured the only option they had was that of Jadeja and Karn as Kedar have yet to bowl this IPL, How is this Dhoni fault.

I am not a MSD fan but i can definitely tell that he is a legend in cricket history.

This season CSK is not performing well as most of their players are past the 35 yrs, you can say that Dhoni didn't perform well this season but that does not mean he was a bad player, and what do they mean by ""hope this will open their eyes and Dhoni is fake""

Also the way these guys are behaving as a MI fan i hope they won't target us when we are underperforming cause MI have won the most IPL.",6
"Feel bad for Curran, he bowled a tight 19th over too",31
I think there's an unwritten rule for broadcasters that if you criticize certain players you won't be contracted for the next tournament. These guys get paid big bucks for a cushy job. So they don't want to jeopardise that.,18
"Thala- Pitch was better for batting 2nd. Then why the F you batted first, smartass!",49
"A week ago, I wanted a different opening partner for Rohit in 2021 T20 WC. But last 3 innings  in this IPL, Dhawan has proven that he still has it in him despite the injuries he suffered recently. He could have made a difference had he played 2019 WC fully as he has always been the most reliable big match player for us in the last decade.",18
