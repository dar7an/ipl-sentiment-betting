The JC Insiders are an absolute vibe. At times they're more entertaining than the games itself.,7
Low scoring thriller today?,2
"The only interesting pre show I've seen. 
Swanny is a treasure.",11
"Imagine


- Dhoni retiring after winning the 5th trophy


- RCB releasing DK after a poor show in this IPL.


- CSK buying DK in the auctions - dream come true for DK.


- DK becoming the next MS, comes back into the T20 setup yet again.


Now read the first word again, my man MS ain't going anywhere you dumbfucks! 


_wipes tears, injects copium_",40
Whats more interesting for you guys? Watching your team bat of bowl?,4
Swanny a better umpire than all IPL umpires,8
Wtf Jaddu bring back the beard ffs.,1
"""DC going to win ipl 2023 trophy""

"Yes let Jos bat first, he needs a big score",5
"Thala dhoni vs Sanju ""i think"" Samson.",2
üö®SANJU WON THE TOSSüö®,1
Did he fking say Boult misses out?,2
Zampa IN ... Boult Out,1
No boult? Fuck,1
Thank god for batting first.,1
Damn no Boult for both fixtures we got lucky,7
No football score today :(,-1
üíÄüíÄ bro how tf did boult again get a niggle just against csk. He's missed both the csk games now.,28
Even Sanju knows the yellow turnout is for this particular season's finale.,1
No Boult again against CSK.,2
Boult not playing yayayayayayayayayayayyayaayyayayyyyyyy,8
"Who's the worst coin tosser this year? MS seems to have lost his toss winning ability, smh.",3
Let's go Thala vs Sandeep Sharma part 2,9
What's with Samson winning toss,1
Boult's Tactical Niggle against CSK again.,5
The last 7 games have been won by the team batting first.....,3
Dhoni wanted to bowl first?,3
Batting first is the best shot we have to this game,2
why is it always murli karthik when csk plays,6
GIVE ME BOULTTTTTY,2
also I absolutely love the Greame Swanne Umpiring Gig,9
Boult conveniently gets a niggle when playing CSK. Happened twice now.,8
"Boult niggle?

Conway might have called in a favour. ü§≠",10
"Boult whenever he has to play CSK:


I will NOT be there no matter what",19
"Boult knows csk is too noob for using his powers.
Thanks boulty for ur generosity",3
My feeble heart isn't ready for the cracker of a contest we will have tonight.,3
Finally RR realised they are not a chasing team.,3
Not going to upvote this thread until they put up the Jail Cla≈õico flair.,6
"Yo RR, Thala is old now pls play boult.",-4
The fact that we can play with 4 spinnersss lololol,5
"My girlfriend came over and asked me where salt was, told her ""csk"" she understood it was on top of the shelf, she said she couldn't get there, and I replied ""exactly"", she is an ""MI"" fanüòå",64
Conways Kiwi special gawk gawk 3000 always knocks Boults legs before every Jail Classico.,9
"Looking at the sub go wild over spinners, I assumed they were playing Rooooot, fuck off, not gonna get fooled in ""achche din"" again",5
"RR to fans: We did it, We finally let Parag go

Fans: *Massive Boner*

RR: Uhhhhh Boult Niggle too tho

Fans: Bruh",5
"Well shit, we're chasing",3
[deleted],10
Root go to county man the sheer disrespect,17
The real reason Boulty Boy is not playing is because he fears Ruturaj Gaikwad. He still gets flashbacks of that innings where Rutu bashed Boulty and Boom Boom all over the park (including the sweep to the full toss from Bumrah).,8
Your one bold prediction for the second half of the IPL.,2
"Dhoni pull this season has been crazy..

Every stadium so far has been Chepauk for him",7
"RR 197/7 (20)

CSK 190/7 (20)

RR won by 7 runs",2
Yo who was Thala's only ODI Wicket,1
What's the weather at Jaipur today like?,4
Rutu needs to stay in th chase we have to face 3 top tier spinners he is someone who will.keep score ticking against them....,9
"I miss 2021 BatDeep team, we used to bat till No. 10",12
Thala would be completing the chase that was left incomplete during the previous match.,4
"Kinda happy Boult is not playing. Zampa takes wickets too but not in a ""first over demolition way"".",9
Just looked at Thala record against Boult  üíÄüíÄüíÄ,8
"Root in 

DDP out 

Plz",8
Ruturaj after seeing no Boult: üóøüóø,10

No El Boulto :/,4
"RR- Plays 3 Specialist Spinners

CSK- Plays 2 and a half with Santner in the dugout

GT- Plays 2 Foreign Spinners with Sai Kishore in the dugout 

RCB-Spin? Eh? Take 1. Maybe 1 and a half if Maxi feels like it",5
Thala 50 plsss üçëüçëüçÜüçÜ,-6
Will be kinda unbelievable if dhoni can turn this team into champions. Shows how great his captaincy is,5
In b4 thala storms onto the pitch again circa 2019,4
[deleted],3
The avg score is just 134 here ?,3
How come Boult gets niggle everytime he has to play CSK?,19
People are really overrating root spinn bolwing,2
HE DID THE RIGHT THING AT THE TOSS,2
Please kuldeep sen üôèüèº we really need you Please get fit soon,5
Is rooty in?,1
RR should have gone with an indian pacer in place of Boult and picked Root in place of DDP. And use M Ashwin as substitute if they needed a 3rd spinner.,7
So. We want RR to win. Right?,8
"Somebody mentioned Root and I assumed he was in, but had to remind myself that Amritkaal is a lie",4
I have no doubt the day obed McCoy gets fit holder will get dropped,4
not having Prasidh as well as Kuldeep sen has really weakened our pace bowling.,3
This ground isn't as yelllow tbh,3
So kuldip Yadav is gonna be our IP ? Left arm pace but got no other info about him. Who's he ?,3
Holder again? May be give Donovan Ferreira a go,1
Please don‚Äôt play JRoot and bully him. Need his confidence at all time lows before the World Cup.,4
Jail Clasico flair where??,10
Boulty could have given us few early wickets,7
I'm just here to see Sawai Man Singh painted with yellow,3
"We can't really pick Indian pacer

Kuldeep sen - not fit 

Saini - beamer king

Asif - run leaker",1
Can CSK take revenge for the previous game,5
Rajasthan got more chennai based player then chennai,7
We could have played Santner in place of Papa Moeen,3
Calling a Dhoni 56*(28) today,7
Jos the boss needs to wake up and choose violence against csk.,5
"Is every stadium filled with yellow just because this is thala's last season?
I dont remember seeing this in older seasons",5
Kuldip Yadav the left arm pacer is in impact sub list,2
Dhonis' hair is magnificent.,4

Anyone like Pommie and KP commentary?,1
"Boult didn't play against CSK in the first round.

Something is really fishy the way things have fallen in place for CSK.

Looks like Thala is gonna get the best farewell and everyone is up for it.",-5
Man Chennai really playing 14 home games this season.,71
"(3)7th match, it's been already decided",5
The powerplay will be key. Will definitely set the tempo for the rest of the innings pretty much for both teams,1
I think kuldeep yadav will be our IP. Looks promising.,1
"There's no way I would've expected CSK to win this season, at the start of this season.

Not as unexpected as GT winning last year, but still extremely surprising.",4
Need Santhner ...,2
No Boult? So you're telling me there's actually a chance we can win this match?,3
NAAH MAN FORREAL? ZAMPA COMES IN? I WAS ON NOFAP JOURNEY WHY DID YOU DID THIS HELL NAAAH BRUHH I JUST BUSTED,1
Akash home ground. Buttler watch out.,1
Bruh Root needs to play a game!,3
Jos pls. Do your thing,1
Comeon jaiswal just think of akash as khaleel and smack 5 fours.,2
This is akash singh's home stadium less goooo,5
"""MSDHINI""",1
Without boult its gonna be hard for rr,-2
Buttler must be excited to play against a T20 veteran like Rahane.,4
"They do know that sign could be read as ""Ms Dhoni"" instead of ""M. S. Dhoni""",5
Jaiswal the intent,2
No Root again üò•,1
5 fours incoming bois,1
24 RPO RR they will end up scoring 480 match done üò≠üò≠üò≠,11
Ily jaiswal,1

Lol. 5 fours seriously incoming.,2
Now watch Akash taking him ...,1
Jaiswal century incoming üíÄ,1

India needs this vs a left arm swing bowler,1
"Big setback for RR since their best player is out of the team today, lucky CSK getting to face RR without Riyan Parag",4
Pure sex shot,1
Jaiswal will be big definitely,4
We are so fucked today,4
This dude is some talent,7
Im gonna fap to a Rahane photo if he scores a ton against us,5
Yashaswi Buttler is killing it,5
How's the Jaipur pitch? Is it a batting paradise?,3
Okay this is a bad start,4
Imagine having won From CSK but lost from RCB,2
Man this guy is talented af,4
Boult is out? Why?,1
Let Jaiswal cook,1
Generally is SMS full? Or is this the Dhoni effect?,2
Akash Singh looks like a guy who religiously reads the upnishads after training,9
"Jaa Jaiswal Jaa. Jee le apni intent innings. 

T - Go Jaiswal! Go and play intent innings.",1
Jaiswal 100 loading,1
It would be funny if KM Asif is subbed in by RR and he picks up a 5-fer. Guy was basically benched by CSK for 4 years.,5
Akash is pissed man,3
"Yall pls chill tf out, we know boult is missing but we did defeat csk without boult in the first game.",12
"Halla bol or thalaa bol 

On Which side you are ?",5
CSK lost to RR both times in 2008 and they made the final. This is a good thing for CSK.,7
My man is just dealing in fours,3
"I love that shot so much, no matter if its a t20 or any other format, That's a class shot",1
Lefty vs lefty violence,3
Started river of fours,1
Jaiswal 150 loading,3
"Today is going to be a challenge for CSK's bowling, for a bowling lineup considered weak they have indeed done well but they've also been defending 200+ meaning batters feel obliged to hit everything for four. Now that they are bowling first, RR will be able to pace their innings without much pressure.",12
Jaiswal MF Always clicks against CSK...,9
Now Buttler. Just survive the first ball.,6
Csk as always will give 60-70 run in powerplayy!!,4
"If Jaiswal manages to improve his post Powerplay game, he‚Äôd reach greater levels",7
JOS AVOIDED DUCK üö®üö®üö®,2
Butler needs to be dismissed soon.,3
180 pitch .,2
Hoping Deshpande bowls a tight over here.,3
Dhoni got more hair than Samson ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,3
200+ easily. This will be a litmus test for both CSK bowling and batting while chasing.,4
220-5 rr at the end of 1st innings,3
CSK must bring spin in the powerplay,4
[deleted],3
As I viewer let us freaking settle us first ! Started hitting already,2
Our bowling hasn't really been good.I mean they have defended 200+ scores but can they defend 150?,6

That speed display is high right now,2

If I get smashed for 24 runs in 5 deliveries

And take a wicket in final delivery.

Who is the winner? Is it me or the batsman ?",3

Jos Jaiswal is catching up,2
So we are supposed to ignore that malfunction they had with the speed thing,2

That's why I prefer watching Jaiswal",7

how tf is that ball 145kph?? thala juju supremacy üõêüõê,9

A real good batting pitch. We would also have the advantage. No freaking out.,7
Jos boss,4

Rahane vs Jaiswal today,6

Deshpande mentioned in an interview few matches ago that he is working to touch 145+ kph,9

I'm scared. Stop,6
Who owns rr?,3
This ground seems teeny tiny,4
Deshpande is quicker than what I thought,3

CSK's bowling is laughable!,5
Looking bad.,5
246/5 loading :/,8
I wish rutu finds his touch again - with the way Jaiswal is batting it doesn't seem like a hard pitch to bat on,9
Csk bowlers getting exposed after being shielded by the 200+ scores they had to defend,42

How is jaiswal in red ball cricket?,1
So I guess csk's bowling is back to its usual shitty self,3

Jaiswal Stop! He's already dead.,2

But I know the jadeja moen and theekshana gonna slow us down.",4
"This isn't bad bowling, this is peak batting",6
RR looking at 220.,5
"lol CSK ignoring Jaiswal has issues with the short ball, how are they topping the table",5
RT won't score more than 210,2

Belt treatment from Jaiswal..,6
"Left handed batters who are naturally right handed people are the best in terms of watchability.

Then again, I might be biased being one myself...",3
"Length deliveries with virtually no variation, on this pitch, is essentially telling the RR openers 'Spank me daddy!'",0
I think they need to send all the ipl performers to Asian games with rahane as captain,1
"Yashavi Jaiswal will be the T20 Version of Sarfaraz Khan  IMO

Will tear up domestic but won't get an India cap for years",3
I just want RR to not qualify that‚Äôs all,2

Csk bowling back to being shit again. Looking like rr gonna get 230+,4
Yaa this is one match in season where CSK just get thrashed....,4
Match's done already,3

"People thought CSK bowling was good. It was just that they had to defend 200+ scores hence why they looked good. And even in those matches, they did concede 200 runs. RCB was just 10 runs short of chasing a total of 230. KKR also reached around the 200-run mark. Let's hope Jinx can save CSK today.",3

Pitched outside leg I think or umpires call,3
That‚Äôs out i think,0
"CSK seriously needs Chahar to be fit and back in form & needs to get Tyagi from SRH next season. Our powerplay bowling is shit. Also, get a foreign  all-rounder who can bat in the middle. Otherwise, we are toast after Thala's exit.",3

"Despite him getting smacked i like the attitude of akash , looks like a confident guy in his abilities.",1
"I think Not out, it's reviewed because Jaiswal is looking destructive.",3
Too high?,3
Pitching outside leg,4
Advantage RR. Because Jaiswal tends to KL it after the PowerPlay.,5
Outside I guess,1
Not out I think. Gonna be a waste of a review,5
Dhoni or Dhennier review system which one is it gonna be,6
"Rahane will be familiar with this ground, he even has an ipl 100 here so I‚Äôm expecting a score from him tonight",3

Spin choke so early,8
"Nah, Dhoni can't be wrong. The ball tracking system is faulty for sure.",14
"If the ball pitches within 3cm outside leg, review should not be lost.",4

Is this the match up with the least bad blood between them in the IPL? Not exactly a friendly rivalry but can't think of any other two teams that fit the description,7
In last 6 times CSK have faced RR they've only won single game....,17
RR is entirely different team while batting first,11
I don't like this Buttler.,5
"Thala, I am once again for Mitchell Santner to play again :(",8
The only way CSK can recover from Jaiswal's hitting is if they can have Jaiswal bat for another 4-5 overs after powerplay.,43

Nice pick up..,2
BEAUTIFULLLL,3
Lol they cuntung wait till Dube comes to bat lol.....,2

Wanted the ball to go just a little further and smash the screen,1
Butler better give jaiswal more balls in pp. He can't slow down for his 50 if he gets his 50 before powerplay ends. üòé,10

"12 overs of spin on this pitch 

Brilliant from RR",3
Only post-powerplay Jaiswal can save CSK now.,8
Like seriously..this is so so long that RR are having a really brilliant team and I think it's the first time RR entered a tournament as one of the favourites. So it'll be a major heartbreak if they don't increase their trophy count before the mega auction.,5

Jaiswal butler partnership is better with jaiswal attacking in powerplay where he's the best and Buttler changing his gear later,3
Every year some team just has our number. It‚Äôs been MI in the past but looking like RR now,3
bruh Buttler is still 23(15) after basically letting Jaiswal do 75% of the work,11

Pitch is playing better than the last game but CSK has been ordinary. With 12 overs of spin of RR anything above 170 will be hard to chase and RR are all set for a 190+ finish,5

Buttler this season=Rahul,-6
"The problem with younger generation we have is that they dont slow down and stat pad but keep hitting and get out. So many 30s and 40s which dont count as they are not milestones like our senior super stars. No number of 50s, big averages, orange caps which the fans and management love so much",5
Buttler simply saving his energy for Mumbai. Y'all need to chill.,25
Theekshana already done with 3 overs. Who's gonna bowl the rest? Moeen?,11

If Moeen doesn't score Runs he's going to be dropped for Stokes Purely because CSK are mad trash in the PP,5
Moeen should step up real time this game,1
Lmao whats up with that attitude i thought buttler‚Äôs done,5
Ashwin has made such an impact on Buttler that he won't move a muscle even after Dhoni moves to the other end after a quick stumping attempt.,12
I‚Äôm just patiently waiting for Moeen Ali to come to ball and send both the openers packing.,6

Buttler lost his touch after that 40 (41),1

Swanny knows CeatTyres^TM Strategic Timeout is the real deal,5
"Gonna be really interesting to see who comes now. 

DDP means a likelihood of runrate dipping from 10 to 7.

Samson on other hand is known to hit spin bowling with SR of 160-165.",5
Bruh ddp now would really slow things down. Sanju would be better next.,-1
It's all going according to plan. Buttler is just practicing for WC.,6
"I fear samson is coming in next, which makes parag the impact player at the end for DDP",2
It's ok RR fans. MI bowling lineup will give buttler back his form,6
It was Thala's plan all along to make the match interesting and keep RR's 14 fans' hopes alive before extinguishing it,2
lmao why is everyone hating on butler,5
If CSk can restrict RR below 180 they have a chance or it is done and dusted,0
"Buttler's form always disappears after initial few matches. He hasn't looked convincing in the last 5 matches.

And people were already comparing him to Warner and Gayle.",-3
"Jos vs srh - 54(22)

Jos vs DC- 79 (51)

Jos vs csk - 52 (36)

"Everyone shitting butler for this innings , this kinda innings is gold for dc and lsg fans",9
Sanju would come in for left/right balance,1
"Buttler this year in the ipl is averaging around 34 striking at 140, yeah he is a bit out of touch and is looking a bit scratchy but in no way at all is he a worry at the top with those numbers",4
"Ddp coming in for sure, but why we not playing with additional batter?",-2
I‚Äôm betting that RR will finally release Pan Parag after this tourney,9
Even when opposition going at 12 rpo...CSK players are calm no exaggerated expression in field...that shows a calm head on most of those players,6
Why didn't the girl in the Rupay ad just go around the sinkhole and pull him out from the other side she could've reached from that side,19
Buttler will find his form against MI next game. At Wankhede against village level bowling attack.,13
"I know RCB ain't great making decisions. But boy, was dropping DDP  a good one...",1
"More than RCB's playoff chances, I'm interested in finding out what happens to the thieves in the closet.",1

Not like shitposting but genuine hate",10

Samson will be fine. No Hasaranga here.,4
"Man, the Jadeja ball that got samson last game was just chef kiss",4
swanny is too good,5
Can Dhoni stump Dube?,7
"For all the talk about Buttler being an IPL GOAT, he has only had two good seasons in 8 years, in 2018 when he made five consecutive fifties and then last year.

Miles to go before he is considered in same league as Warner/Gayle.",-2

Samson v jaddu is a matchup advantageous to jaddu,2

Waiting for Samson quick innings,5

Jaddu without beard is still lethal,13

There comes a maiden,2
Samson is going to eat moeen ali alive,2
"Bruh fuck this salman advertisement
Trash ass advertisement",9
Oh that shot was a beauty,5
Young boy jaiswal üî•,4
No spin choke today ig,5
My word!,3
Wow,1
"Fuck, a bit wider and that would have stumped",1
Ybj looks to be in the mood today.,3
How did RR find Jaiswal,2
Which spinner will RR take on. My guess is Moen or Jaddu,1
If jaiswal can keep going then sanju can take 5 to 6 balls to settle in.,3
Should have played santner today,4
Jaiswal on fire,2
Keep going Jaiswal you will get selected for India after 5 years keeo going...,6
Jaiswal: don't need strike rotation if I keep banging a couple of boundaries each over,4
Now that HOW you charge down and hit it out of park,1
"I was just about to type: ""so let's see how many overs we have with runs below 8 per over since last one went for 5 runs""

And then Jaiswal hits a six against moeen",1
This is around the time jaiswal gets out,-3
Jaiswal 100 incoming,2
Jaiswal and Rinku have to get fast tracked to the Indian team. Indian selectors really clueless.,5
spin choke where? said Jaiswal.,5
bro just go good through these over and death bashing would be easy,4
Its half the season.. Jiocinema still doesnt have go live button..,10
Someone said Jaiswal will slow down after pp. Hmmm Thanks!!!,10

His story is inspiring.",35

These twos gonna be really crucial in a stadium like SMS,4
Only 30% to Jaiswal ü•∫,5
"Without Boult, RR need at least 220 to stay in the game. CSK's batting is way too strong.",-6
It has been turning for all 3 spinners so far,2
Swann speaking absolute rubbish from an aerodynamics POV lmao,3
"engine uppity scarce truck automatic correct zealous numerous attempt aware

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*",10
10rpo against spin is ideal. Maybe 12+ against pace,2

Haha that sunglasses,4
That six gave raina flashbacks,9
"100-1 in 10.00

Ashwin and Chahal are going to love bowling here.,7

No shit.",5
"How many players, at least from the current crop, would be in the starting XI of most countries, if they weren't born in India?",2
Ash Anna looking at the turn.,8
Avg score for the ground please??,2
Samson to do something stupid and get out this over,1
"100 in 10 overs is a great score for Sawai Man Singh stadium. They have definitely changed the pitch for today compared to last match, over even compared to in general from previous IPL seasons",6
"these sudden wicket highlights gives me mini heartattacks, asshole broadcasters",3
Samson stands tall among players like viru and brohit in how fast he gets back to pavilion hope he keeps up the legacy,-9
4 below par games for buttler now. Concerning,4
Just finish the lethal jadeja overs with 6-7 RPO and then tonk others with 12-14 RPO.,4
What I like is how Jaiswal has combined low risk ground shots and gone for the biggie rarely - not hit out or played false shots,10
How long does Sanju usually take to get going?,2
Either Buttler can be in form or Jaiswal. You can‚Äôt have both.,10
Jadega looking like a rugged 90‚Äôs hero,8

Moeen's bowling could be the deciding factor tonight.,1
Man..jadeja has always been a pain for us for past few seasons..his bowling really  slows us down.,3
"This ""Silver hath"" from rupay ad is stuck in my mind.",3
"These ""fan polls"" are mostly voting for which team has more fans than anything else, unfortunately.",13
Hope Jaiswal gets a 100,3
"What do you even mean by a complete player? 
Such a shit argument tbh.",3
"CSK batting has saved the mediocrity of the bowling quality. Also every time the batting cannot save the team,  need decent bowlers too",6

Jadeja has been really economical this IPL. Can't really find more than a single match where he was tonked to hell and back.,7
Ayo Fleming interview means wicket incoming....,11
"Man jadeja soo good. Absolute rockstar. Apart from that one single sixer he conceded, his spell has been unbelievably tight",13
Ms dhoni likes to use him in the second half. Boy had internet corrupted us bad,8
"Crucial period for RR. This is the phase they lost both their last two matches, albeit chasing. Can't take foot of the pedal.",3
Now we will see whether training against that random kid worked,2
Fucked already again,1
Lol the ground is patchy like my unmoisturized skin in winter,2
Stokes to score half century/ take 2 wickets in playoffs,2
"Next poll : young opener Ishan or prithvi?

Voters : ü•∫",5
That's not a wide ffs,9
so pathirana will finally meet malinga today post match...,5
This wide is cruel,10
"What bullshit umpiring

That wasnt wide",8
Ben Stokes is a wasted purchase.,5
"Tbh, Gaikwad, Convey, Rahane and Dube have shielded this bowling attack",4
Calling that wide is just rubbish.,10
God damn!,4
Brilliant from Jadeja,10
Nahhh review that. That‚Äôs not a wide,8
Lovely Jaddu,6
"calling stephen, steven lol",3
All round cracking cricket,3
Thia jaddu guy is good filder tbh.,9
Ofcourse it is Jadeja who saves that,6
Jaddu üî•,6
That was fucking ridiculous! Sir Jadeja for a reason,13
Jaddu is the goated fielder of this decade,18
Jaddu you beauty!,8
Pathirana looks like a guy who will try to impress my gf by doing her homework,67
Poor decision to call that wide.,9
JADDU,6
Wtf . He stopped that boundary! Jadeja can you just let us please! We already not hitting in your overs!!!,10
That was 149,2
Holy shit Jaddu !,5
Normal day for jadeja,10
Stokes gonna do a Faf of 2018,7
149 ks absolute fire,5
Jadeja chill bro,4
149 holyyy,5
There is still time to get on the Jaiswal hype train if you aren't on,3
149?! Wheww,6
"And just like that the run rate is below 10. That's how we move, you don't even know when we pull the games back",8
Can lose this game but not by a huge margin pls,6
We've two bowler bowling over 145+ damn,9
Best fielder for a reason!,5
Bruh how did jaddu stop that 4,11
"""nothing to lose"" is accurate for Rahane",10
it's still a good pitch for spin bowling but Jaiswal has played exceptionally well here,4
Having one Head Coach for so so many years itself is a huge achievement,23
"CSK's success has been directly related to Jadeja's bowling form. 

His bowling sucked in 2020 & 2022 and we got rekt.",12
[removed],6
We have 3 bowlers who can bowl 145+ lmao.,6
Fielding!,8
"Speed gun at this ground is tied to a tree with a rope lmao everybody's gonna break records

Edit: I'm not racist I'm Rajasthani lol",5
Consistency of Teekshana's fielding,3
I think dhoni likes to scold Akashü§£ü§£ü§£,14
CSK fielding choke^TM,15
"That wide call seemed harsh. Pathirana didn't react too much though, seems like a cool head.",14
Conway is a gun fielder as well,8
great fielding!!,3
I think Jaddu is one of the few players who isn‚Äôt hated by anyone,8
"So you‚Äôre telling me Deshpande is bowling at the same pace Pathirana is?!?! 

Speed gun smoked weed & getting high when Deshpande bowls",12
Field chock is on guys,9
Wtf is this fielding? Holy shit.,15
"Dude wtf, these are certain boundaries, how are they saving these",14
Slowing down towards middle overs.. Harsha wont be too happy..,3
This over feels forever for some reason,11
Fleming talking about how Impact rule diminishes All rounders as well,13
What's this fielding üòî it's already a tough task to hit pathirana.,18
Excellent fielding.,9
Conway to start with 2*,19
wow smooth af from conway,6
"Conway, Jaddu and Rutu being absolute gun fielders for us wow",17
"RR have Malinga with them, if any team will be reasonably comfortable playing Pathirana it will be them.",12
Uff what a fielding by jaddu and Conway. BEAUTY,17
[deleted],25
Gun boundary riders of CSK in their 30s,19
Conway really trying hard to fill Faf's role,13
CSK fielding would have become even more OP with Santner. Just saying.,10
Will NMACC plays have subtitles,2
RR are not getting past 190.,1
"Pathirana is really developing under Thala‚Ä¶bro is gonna dominate the international scene if he continues this way. 

He should defo chat with Mali after this game",8
Conway and Jaddu saved 4 runs üî•,8
Thats four runs saved on the boundary and only one extra conceded in the circle,7
Samson is cooking... Either he is gonna explode or implode... Hope he explodes and shits all over,8
New zealand fielders get me hard,8
Finally,2
Jaiswal is a man possessed today,5
9 off Pathirana is a win imo,3
"Yooo! Conway. 

These kinda fielding isn't required. There's none to replace in case of injury.",5
Moen is joke,0
Field that mf,4
Is SMS the smallest franchise stadium in the country?,6
Jaiswal 100 when?,1
"Akash Singh is reverse Jadeja.
Can't bat, bowl, or field. 

Hair to body ratio as well.",2
Didn't notice until now that Jaiswal has the Thala type pads.,8
Jaiswal making Conway run lol,6
Jaiswal will get 100 but will be in loosing cause just like Rutu got one in 2021.....,4
One good thing about Jadeja bowling is that he won't be out there in the deep fielding!,5
How on earth they did not run 3??,2
"As a neutral, want whoever wins to be super one sided so that the loser's nrr drops",1
Why does Jaiswal play with double pads?,2
4 2 0,3
Is this jaiswal 's highest score in ipl?,3
Sunny had to be on comms when Jaiswal nailed that sweep lol,2
"Jaiswal, Gaikwad, Gill.
India's top 3 hopefully one day. In any order it doesn't matter.",12
"Pathirana, Hasaranga , Teekshana...Sri Lanka is cooking some really good bowling attack",19
"RR have batted well against CSK's spin, just like they did in Chennai. CSK were unable to manage Ashwin and Chahal and that made the difference in Chennai.",11
"Conway is holding on to his arm. 

I don't feel good üò≠",7
Do we have an Indian pacers that's a good fielder?,4
Match winning knock from Jaiswal already.,12
Can't believe that there are more RR fans than CSK fans at the ground,10
"Sanju hits a four on Jaddu, hope all the brakes are off now",3
This fielding will make huge difference today. 6 runs saved already,5
"Sanju playing Run a ball today...

His fans : We'll pretend that this didn't happen

KL Rahul : Plays run a ball

Even dead man from his grave : ü§¨",-2
"Yellove buddies, I have a bad feeling about this.",8
Sanju hit the mandatory boundary time for rash shot,4
"Pathirana and Deshpande bowling 145+

Jaddu 105+

what is going on.",7
Halla bol is the best theme song this season..,5
Are Shubhman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal the only players from India‚Äôs u19 WC squad (since Kohli) actually living up to their hype? Bishnoi doing decent too but not near those 2 I guess,5
CSK has no answer for Jai-sawal.,9
at this point if we keep it under 200 I'll be happy,6
Who next? Hetty or jurel?,4
Should‚Äôve been a catch watching that fat guy run hurts my eyes,4
Im waiting for Samson to switch gears and create some havoc,6
 C'mon Sanju do something,4
BRO THEY HAVE BEEN SO GOOD AGAINST SPIN AND HERE WE ARE SPINBUNNY,6
Sanju's ability to get into proper positions against short deliveries Is as good as lanning's. Esp against the spinners.,5
"Pathirana: 145+ 
Jaddu: 100+ 
Is the speed gun measuring the speed of the ball off the hand or off the bat?",4
Csk spinners average speed must be around 105kmph,7
"Poor bowling from CSK's spinners, they can slow it down a bit here there is enough lateral movement for spinner here to pose doubts in the minds of the batters. Right now CSK's spinners are darting it in and often bowling short, allowing RR batters to pick their spot.",5
Remember that innings in 2020/21 where jaiswal got a 50 in the PP against us ? Yeah this is giving flashbacks,6
"Uh oh, Thala adjusting field",4
"harshal and jaddu, both bowl at 100 xD",7
Atleast 230 runs will be scored by rr,6
Nooooooooooooooo,3
This match we actually need our batsmen to pop off,7
welp there goes Sanju lmao,4
Can Deshpande do a Lord Shardul and pick a wicket in middle over?,13
What's the CSK win % now ?,3
Yeah knew it with Samsung,3
Deshpande really is Shardul Thakur.,11
Ganju Samson shows up,3
Sanju why u do this,3
Needed a tactical drop there.,4
Dance now samsung,0
Rutu ain't gonna drop them!,5
Samson giving wicket to a waste ball & 3rd class bowler is the most Sanju thing ever,2
Dhool 2.0 lmao,2
Send in Dhruv for LH RH combo,2
Samson‚Äôs slump continues,2
Fuck finally... but still Jaiswal around and next will be Hetmeyer. Lord save us!!,3
advantage ............. RR,2
"BRO how the fuck despanda takes so much wickets , i see lord in him",5
Sanju ‚ÄúKL Rahul‚Äù Samson,2
Got out but how elegant did that shot look lol,7
sanju pulling a ddp,3
Why not send Hetmyer. What a way to ruin momentum with this bum,-2
Sanju why you gotta hurt me like this üíî,3
9 wickets in hand.CSK needs to come very good in last overs or this is gonna be carnage. Good start by Tushar,5
"Like every year

We get two samsons

First half Samson

Second half samson",7
I'm done with Sanju,-4
lessgo. but i feel we have already lost :/ unless we restrict em under 180 (even this would be a lot).,5
"The sadder thing is Samson played against his instincts. 
He played how Indian selectors want him to.",3
"Bruh Deshapande is Thakur Lite lmao

ER of 11 + 4th in purple cap Race",20
"**13.1** and he strikes immediately. It was an offcutter at 126kph. A length ball around off that Samson looked to hit over long-on. Didn't middle it and Gaikwad takes an easy catch well inside the long-on boundary

Sanju Samson c Gaikwad b Deshpande 17 (17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100",2
Murali Vijay vibes from that catch some reason,6
Jaiswal really carrying,3
Send jurel,2
Need jaiswal wicket and we‚Äôre in the game,3
Always plays for the team! Lucky to have him as our captain. HALLA BOL,5
Tushar has a knack like shardul run machine and wicket machine at the same time,5
"Can't really summarize Samson's current IPL season. 
Has been quite shit in some matches, has been brilliant in others.",4
Jurel plsss,2
"This is the problem with Sanju.. plays 2-3 Blinder of an innings in a season, then inconsistent knocks in between, doesn't really capitalize much even when he's in form..",3
[deleted],6
"Score/Win Prediction : 195 runs - 79.81%

add 12 overs of RR spin on this track and it goes to 100%",3
DK ad must feel especially insulting now. It's like Rohit telling me of how Archer is going to nail RR batsmen's stumps,2
"""Dear Captain, Jaipur is missing your Helicoptors"" I think Sanju thought it was meant for him and got out. Poor guy!!",3
If purple patel got it why not tushar,2
Send hetmeyer already smh,2
so they will bring in Pan Parag as an impact right? right?,2
Where‚Äôs Padikkal üòû,4
The key here is to hit it square if you want 6s,2
Can sanju army shut up now? Apart from the match against GT he‚Äôs been average at best especially with his strike rate,2
KLassic knock by Sanju,2
"Finally sent Hetmeyer early, good shit",8
Hmm. Good move sending hettie,5
No paddikal?lol they are gonna make an opener a finisher at this rate,6
Guys no worries with BatDeep we have good match to enjoy staying on top of the table afford these luxuries,4
Jaiswal is the guy Shaw thinks he's when complaining to Sai baba,11
"Time taken for average players to become good players 

RCB - 2 - 3 seasons 

CSK - 2 - 3 matches 

GT - 1 - 2 matches 

MI - On debut",2
"Samson has to be one of the most overrated players of all time in IPL history. Gets a squad with Buttler, Chahal, Boult, Ashwin and Hetmyer in it, gets praised for his captaincy. Has two good knocks at the beginning of the season and does nothing for the remaining matches. Doesn't even have good domestic stats in any format of the game.",-8
RR actually making sensible decisions. I for one am shocked. None of this Ashwin at 4 bs.,11
I hope he's not the 'Shit'ron Hetmyer from last match,7
Stole a extra run lol,7
Angry Thala,9
RR with intent pro Max sending hettie in,4
I would have soiled my pants if Thala gave me that look,7

yashavi out at 77 on 43balls (4+3=7) coincidence ?,14
Damn first match where i see yellow tshirts are only 50% kudos to Rajasthan and people diss them have having no fans,14
Whenever I switch to English commentary why is it always Murali or Manju on,10
"Good innings.

Deshpande seems to pick up a lot of wickets without bowling particularly well.",15
Excellent bowling changes by Thala,7
Dhoni got tushar a purple cap...ffs you cant help but admire the brains,20

That's not just a catch. That might be the HERBALIFEACTIVECATCHOFTHEMATCH!!!!,30
Deshapnde needs to chill.. üòÇ,3

Everyone becoming running offspinners lately....,1

"Dhoni on his way to make every mediocre bowler wicket taking weapons case in thakur , unadkat and countless other",11

Good tactics by RR to not send Paddikal,2
Purple thushar on the wayy,2
Why does telecast of jaipur ground look uglier than other stadiums?,3
"What in the actual f was that catching technique, jinx!",3
Jurel time ü•µ,2
Fuck yeah deshpande,5
Is tushar our new shardul?,9
"29runs difference between jaiswal and Kohli.
And kohli is 2nd in orange cap",5
Hetty and Jurel at the death is gonna be fun...,5
Yashashvi jaiswal is a talented bloke tbh,2
"Too bad hetty won't play for west indies. Otherwise Mayers, hetty, pooran, Brandon King, Johnson Charles is such a good top 5.",5
Tushar ain't keeping the purple cap with that economy.,2
Lord in the making changes the complexion...,4
RR management W‚Ä¶they‚Äôve got the right intent today. Sending all the hitters & aiming for a huge total,3
188 sr true finsher,2
"Yes they are not sending DDP, blowing his confidence by saying they don‚Äôt trust him and then next year he will come to csk and bring out his 2.0",8
We doing all the right things with our batting lineup! Is it for real? Phew!!! Thanks Sanga,5
Thala for a reason.. 2-7 this over and both set batsmen gone,3
I love seeing Jaisawal bat bruhh this guy never stops hitting. Total madness,8
Bruh Deshpande is beast,4
"A lot of people were mocking the ""Sanju needs to be consistent"" statement and at the risk of getting downvoted, Sanju's last 10 innings in the ipl

I left everything to watch this guy get a 100 but nevertheless it was a good inning,5
Man how the hell does CSK leak all the runs in the first 9 overs and pull back the game by the 15th over every damn time???,7
"RR giving more balls to Hetty and Jurel to play , that is a good move.",3
Nice decision by not sending ddp,5
Lord deshpande really is lord shardul 2.0,5
everyone expects a collapse now. but these two gonna take rr to 210,3
Fun fact: Jurel means cockroach in Marathi,5
Why did jaddu trim so much of his beard,4
"Samson shooting his world cup chances.

Do you think klr can be trusted as sole wicketkeeper in the squad",6
"If Moeen is going to score 20 odd runs and bowl 2 overs, its time CSK gets Santner in his place.",6
Has Deshpande actually gotten quicker?,4
Match set up nicely for the typical Anna revenge vs CSK,11
"Hetmyer, along with Pooran, was supposed to dominate limited overs cricket for West Indies, and individually they were supposed to dominate every T20 league. Somehow, none of it happened. Now every time you see them bat, you think- wasted potential",-3
Bruh!! WTF is that Jio PBKS ad? hahaha,6
"Fuck you RR for applying all the common sense just against us. Now they send Hetmyer and Jurel at the right point of time ahead of DDP. 


We don't get a Testikkal middle overs masterclass? Not even Riyan Parag?",90
Ddp finisher?![img](emote|t5_2qhe0|8767),3
Baby Lord just needs to learn to whack the ball and we could be batdeep again,4
Pro active management keeping padikal out. Rare brains in ipl.,7
"do you like bowlers like shardul harshal deshpande who have high economy but can take wickets and can do little bit of batting or bowlers like shami siraj arshdeep who remain economical and take wickets and can not do batting .

PS : I know people will say shami can bat but he's somewhat a hit or miss type batsman",3
Tushar becoming Dhushman for opponents,2
We got wickets at the right time but i feel RR won't be too sad because this is perfect situation for Hetty and jurel to show their hitting.,3
Time to bring out pan parag boys.....,0
What does strategic timeout means and why is it not implied in international matches ? Are ceat not able to sponsor globally?,10

Is it really necessary to copy those American kids to make an ad? (Ref : Yippee ad),8
Need 3 gun overs from little slinga,7
All hail Purple Pande.,3
Wiqu√© where?,4
Moeen's bowling is super important for CSK to stay in this game.,9
My prediction - 198 runs,5
Kkr will kill to get ddp in their squad rn . Meanwhile rr dosent even have a fixed spot for him,4
"Just realized that LSG has like 5 pbks players. Rahul, bishnoi, pooran and stoinis",7
Comms can't stop talking about MSD,8
The fact that DDP has not come in yet clearly shows he's not T20 material.,6
Is 200 possible now?,1
"In qualifier 1, against GT in Chennai, GT scores 140 odd and we collapse to 60/6.

Gradually take it to 110/8 in 17 overs with Deshpande and Conway on the pitch. The best bowler on the day shami bowls the 19th over, and tushar French cuts 2 fours and slogs one over his head to take the equation down to 6 off 6, which Conway will smoke in the last over.


The conversion of tushar to lord complete.",13
Ez RR win from here,0
Love this batting order so far,7
It's sad that Magala is not playing today...we missed the battle of cheeks between him and Hetty,14
I thought they did less buttering about Dhoni in English commentary at Fox,5
Csk clawing their way back,9
lol hetmyer sprinting is kinda funny to watch,11
RR lost to RCB but beat CSK this season already that too in Chepauk. Peak clownism,18
I wanted raina in this RR team in place of parag last year in the auction..would wonder how that would have turned out.,5
letting Moeen Ali get away with a 7 run over here is madness,7
Anything under 200 csk will chase,3
Hetty is resembling Indian uncle day by day,15
So bumrah was always ready shoot dream 11 adverts?? When were these shot lmao,9
Is swann in Insiders?,3
Hindi English or insider's which to choose ladies and gents?,-1
Top order explosive lefty.. India haven't had that in agesss. V excited for Yashashvi,14
I straight up hate Pathis bowling action,-11
Hetmyer s sliding was smoooth,3
Edged?,2
Great bowling ma man,7
Bruh pathirana improved so much,8
"Hayden spent an entire over gushing over Dhoni, forgetting that he has to commentate on the match proceedings.",7
Hetmyer's been shitting the bed last few matches,4
we will have an extra bowler today probably? didnt check the impact player list but it should be like that I suppose?,2
Is Tushar Deshpande in purple cap race??,4
[deleted],-4
IIRC no team has ever scored 200+ in an ipl game at sms,8
Fucking hell shut the fuck up Murali Karthik,8
"There was a sound there, wasn't there?",4
Pathirana you beauty,8
Hetty in shambles,3
Bruhhh pathi move out of the way,7
Why the hell can't the comms appreciate a CSK player's performance without mentioning MSD?!,8
"""Why's he hittin' me""",6
"Pathirana, Deshpande, Hangarekar all bowling 145+

Future looking good.",12
Man..I fear we are going to end up with below part total now.,8
Dhoni eye for talent is generational,15
It was headed straight for the stumps‚Ä¶the trajectory was on point WTF is this guy doing lmao,9
Thala is a little animated today.,36
MS is angry today .,17
Need Hetty to take off here to get to 190-200,4
Dhoni like an old school headmaster coaching kids haha,11
Lol proper teacher Student moment .,8
Its been three overs since they made a solid connection with the ball,5
[deleted],2
"And the song plays: Oh bitch get off the way, get off the way bitch get off the way!",5
Dhoni angry,6
rare 2 L from THALA,1
149 kmph .......,13
"Pathirana is not hyped enough, he bowls 145+ effortlessly and is getting pretty accurate. He's one to look out for in future.",23
Pathirana & Akash Singh finna make sure Dhoni ends up with High BP by the end of the season,19
MS loves Pathirana,13
Something about Jaipur and angry Thala noises,44
When did this fucker start bowling so fast?,10
148.5... woah,7
You block my run out I don't take your catch /s,15
How good is Pathirana seriously? Srilanka have a real gem on their hands.,23
SL really got their Malinga 2.0...,17
Holy shit 149 kmph,18
"But can this guy bleach his hair and rock curls??


Yeah that's your Malinga huh

Pathirana Theekshana Hasaranga - Srilanka will be real dark horses this world cup if they can sort their batting.,33
"CSK bowlers bowling 140+ ,let alone 145+,would seem outlandish to any CSK fan before 2022.",19
What happened to the 'Fastest bowler' award?,1
How's this not a Battaaa bowl!!????,2
They're singing jihne mera dil luteya. It reminds me of when I was a kid and I got my hair done like jazzy B because I thought he was cool and went to school and was sent back home. Next day my dad made me get a buzz cut.,1
200 looks v difficult,6
Dhoni ü§ù losing his cool at Jaipur,11
Whats with RR starting well and then losing their way,5
CSK got Malinga Jr and MI got Raina Jr.,8
"149.5 kph yorker

Stop it Pathirana, I can only get so hard",9
BRO he can be a gr8 future death bowler,5
Somethings wrong with the speed gun today.,3
Contain below 175.. possible ?,1
Damn Pathirana is gonna be an ATG,7
My only concern with these kind of scorecard watchers is like they'll say jurel is hitting pathirana without knowing it was top edge.,4
Angry thala face or Surprised Koach face??  Which is best,7
"149,148,149",5
"Pathirana is actual fucking class 

CSK finally has 2 bowlers who can bowl 140+",9
Good to see Sri Lanka still has a good pipeline of players to strongly keep competing in cricket. The future of intl cricket still looks bright,6
Come on destroy the spinner,4
"Malinga: Is Pathirana's consultant in Sri Lanka Team

Commentators: Dhoni specifically cloned this young man in aftermath of 2014 WT20, Masterstroke by Dhoni",6
Goneeee,1
If you know Tushar Deshpande was in DC in 2020 edition because Ricky and co asked shreyas for that emerging player award criteria and he did play quite a games only to get smashed next year he was dropped form DC,2
My man touching 150s that's good fast bowling,10
"2 bowls almost 150, I'm gonna jerk off rn",11
"MSD wrote a personal letter/mail inviting Pathirana here. 

That's the reason why he's going mild on the boy.

This was told in an interview.",12
"With Buttler not working at SMS, things are going to get hard for RR.",3
Since when we had 140+ bowler,3
"Go, went,gone!",2
Please send Anna,2
180.. 190 if hetmeyer stays till the end,1
Ohh i want herüòç,1
ayo Rashford,2
Bye bye booty boiiii,6
WHAT A BEAUTY,4
Thalaiva theekshana!!!,6
Choke me dadd..Chennai.,6
"This style of bowling does help generate a lot of pace and Yorkers are accurate af.

But correcting your line is important and difficult",6
Jaiswalapse,3
Pathirana is putting in some serious pace in that over,3
Im loving theekshana and pathirana‚Äôs bowing. What a duo. Lol,11
"Theekshana and Pathirana, SL stonks",11
Hetmyer has been rubbish since that POTM knock,5
"Theeks, where is the arrow :(",3
"damm that's spicy fast, 149",8
Hetmyer cunted lsg and decided I've done enough I'm satisfied,3
SL have to make sure Malinga works closely with this fella to groom him for the future & stay clear of injuries as much as possible,9
"Hetty gone , inb4 Ash anna masterclass?",2
Chal hatmeyer,-1
Only 2k comments,2
"**16.1** **chopped on.** Was a carrom ball, just outside off. Hetmyer went for the cut but there's hardly any room. Gets a bottom edge onto his stumps

Shimron Hetmyer b Theekshana 8 (10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80",4
Devdutt coming in as a finisher now would pe Peak Memes lmao,10
CSK got the best death bowling unit,11
Rashford's influence is crazy,5
Bow and Arrow celebration where? WHAT A BALL,3
Yeah booyyy lessgoo,3
"CsK get the danger man, Teekshana celebrates

Thala - Let me get that bell on stumps",24
Damn some serious heat from pathirana,9
I‚Äôd be surprised if RR even gets past 180 from here,2
RR bottling that fiery start now,6
Yesss choke them fuckers,5
gr8 comeback from CSK 180 should be the score now,1
Trashford celebration ?,0
Rajasthan starting very well and losing plot,6
Did Theekshana lose his bow and arrow ?,7
There's something about Jaipur that really makes Dhoni lose his cool. Must be the water.,13
-25 off final total.,8
"This is what happens when you drop the good luck charm Parag 
With everyone playing shit, parag would've done well",2
Send in Riyan Parag as an impact player now you idiots,3
Third consecutive match from hettie with a underwhelming performance now. That along with Jos is definitely concerning,6
It's just entertaining to watch these bowlers in action!,4
"That jaiswal guy took the pitch with him ??
Now no one can bat üò≠üò≠",12
This is exactly why RR need a player like Root who can hold one end at the same time rotate strike. He is not a bad striker either,11
DDP the finisher?,4
How much does the scouts gets paid ? And what is the eligibility criteria of becoming one ?,7
Theekshana is unplayable today.,11
Padikkal finisher lmao,6
Wtf are these SL bowlers cooking....a slingy boi bowling 149kmph then an off spinner nailing yorker,12
"Pathirana is....very very good. He's a bit slower than peak Malinga, bowling late 130s mostly. If he can keep up his pace above 140k, this guy is going to be the next Malinga. Has all the skills accuracy and the smarts at a very young age.   
Arguably already the best death bowler in the IPL after Bumrah, maybe along with Arshdeep",9
Dangerous Simran couldn‚Äôt pick that!,7
Easy chase for CSK,-1
SRILANKAN BOWLER GEtting their form on indian pitches OHH NOO,6
Everybody calling this a gone game after the first 5-6 overs forgetting that 7-16 is where we win games,8
"Could have got his maiden century, but got out for 77.

Is Yashasvi a Thalason?",19
wtf is Padikkal doing at No. 6??,3
Thala choke inevitable,5
Only overseas position in CSK in real danger is Moeen Ali.,8
Thala masterclass to force RR to play Parag from now on,4
Anna will save them,2
"All the rules favour the batsmen, so I‚Äôm glad that bowlers are allowed to fuck with batsmen‚Äôs running between the wickets by not moving aside.",2
"It's not going to be easy for CSK batters against Ash, Chahal and Zampa here. There's definitely something for Spinners here, combined with the bigger boundaries Jaipur looks like a fine cricketing venue for me.",4
Padikal the finisherüòé,7
DDP the finisher üò≠üò≠üò≠ unbelievable,3
Collapse coming after that crazy start?,2
Add that one to the classy DDP shots,5
The real finisher is here,2
Anti testikal,7
World is not ready for finisher DDP arc,9
Waw ddp bating at 6üòÖ,1
"jinx and ash battle again, but I think ash has his number",3
Why the fuck is Padikkal scoring boundaries now ?,3
SRI LANKAN COOK SESSION BOYS. LETS GOOO,18
So the spin specialist DDP decides to turn up today,1
"Lmao i am watching on star sports so I am ahead by a delivery or 2 compared to jio watchers , so i forget why people r not reacting to match",5
Hetmeyer generally sucks ass. Never seen him do well against spin or pace unless they bowl slot. He is batting more and more like Russel lately,2
Anything < 200 and it‚Äôs CSK game,9
"bruh they played ""tuk tuk tu kardi"" when Hettie walked off with his 8(10) üíÄ",23
Ash & Chahal gonna have fun on this pitch,11
"Spin Choke is like Spanish Inquisition..


Nobody expects it.. Especially RR",27
Padikkal with intent,3
Has anyone scored a 100 against CSK?,5
DDP looks like he‚Äôs always rushed and pegged back while he‚Äôs playing quicker ones.,6
Yeah no.. No 200,5
Theekshana is just a mystery Afridi.,13
RR Management will send even redditors before Holder for god's sake,33
No way theekshana Is Just 22,21
And we were questioning why Hetty plays only 10-15balls in end,13
"We sent DDP up the order to counter spin. He was shit. 
So we didn't send him today. And now he decides to hit Theeksana.",14
"CSK and spin choke is usual,,, but this is different",15
Imagine this CSK team if they couldn‚Äôt play Sri Lankan players in Chepauk like in the early 2010s üíÄ,17
No one is able to pick Theekshana‚Ä¶not even the set Jaiswal,13
RR think tank thinks DDP is Virgin KL Rahul,10
"Unrelated but what's up with jaiswal's pads. They look like old players' pads(Dhoni, Tendulkar etc.)",16
I humbly ask you RR to give Tushar two more wickets in the next over for Tushar. This is to stay clear of chahal who is on 12 wickets.,3
"We finally send Jurel up to see a 60(30), and the man so far has been reminding us of Parag.",-1
This plot losing interest faster than bhai's new movie...,6
"Paddikal in RR is exciting, last time a mallu boi played for RR it wasn't that good",7
SL's bowling lineup for WC is stacked and sorted,8
Really good quota from Theekshana!,5
"RR scored 7,7,7,7 in the last 4 overs. TFAR",6
At this point why would you send DDP ahead of Holder and honestly even Ash lol,1
SLCSKvRR,3
Thought 200 was granted the way they were going now 180 looks very hard,2
Padikkal will hit Pathirana,2
How great is Dhoni? He is still playing... Not able to run properly... Heard he is taking some injections as well. True Legend.,3
Wickets getting slower and lower towards the end.,1
This is some RCB level Middle/death over batting.,7
Pathi with drop dead gorgeous yorkers,4
Theekshana bowled 2 overs in the PP and 1 at the death. Exceptional spell this going only for 24 runs.,7
Samson and Hetmyer played like Pan Parag undoing whatever momentum jaiswal built.,3
Spinners ruling the game,1
Everyone talking about Pathirana 149KMPH ball but ignore the fact that Deshpande is bowling 140KMPH consistently,7
NGL Klown will wet against Pathirana,2
Ddp had new roles every game. We'll soon see him bowling and keeping as well xD,4
I get Sanju coming in at 3 to maintain left-right combo. But Hetmyer coming in ahead of Padikkal is weird. Hetmyer is much better last 4-5 overs against pace,4
"Parag: Gets Dropped

RR Middle Order: I bet the fans miss him, should remind them of how he bats",5
"Seems like RR is taking Holder's name too literally, holding him back for batting!",2
"With the close distance of Tamilnadu and Srilanka ( Physical outlook ) like you guys I had the same brain fade that

Pathirana is an Indian -_-",7
What‚Äôs TFAR?,2
I was expecting a 210 score but yes since RR has lost all their batting already I am happy for now,3
RR: Holder let him cook,2
Wonder what Rahane will say today?,2
200 pitch where did u go ??,2
"Man how do CSK always have a Yorker merchant for their death overs ffs. 
Earlier we could never hit Bravo. Now Pathi.",5
This baby faced Malinga is clicking some serious pace!,7
RR should not win the IPL simply because they can't let Joe give a chance and were giving unlimited chances to riyan Parag for his shithousery,6
146.9 kmph.. Pathirana..,4
"Pathirana looks like a villager from a humble background

Theekshana had the slight arrogance of a star though",14
RR need to restrict Chennai to less than what they score to win this game,10
Where the fuck is Holder,4
"If RR creep to 180, it would be competitive. Don't try to get 190 and get 170

Jaiswal has batted out of his skin, this isn't an easy pitch",2
Pathirana looks like an innocent kid.,8
Pathirana bowling rockets,4
How are all the 9 RR fans feeling today? Confident or let down by the score?,0
One thing I've seen so far is that Pathirana's fast deliveries are straight and slower deliveries are wide.,3
RR gets hyped as a strong team but they are pretty weak in a lot of areas. They are lucky other teams are also struggling otherwise they wouldn't even make playoffs.,0
It went for boundary but what a ball....,2
"Jurel bro , you gotta hit now, 180-190 is a must if not 200",2
Tactical edge from Padikkal,7
I'm surprised Dube hasn't bowled yet,2
DDP you genius,6
Wow 150Kph!,5
Now here comes people saying padikkal playing with intent without knowing it's an outside edge,7
149.9 kph perfect yorker edged for 4,11
CSK and their obsession of having an underage match winner among daddies,21
150kmph... Hmmmm,9
Absolutely shit batsman,1
Pathirana has a great future. Just need him to stay injury free. Too much torque on that arm makes me wince in pain.,7
"""This CSK team was struggling a couple of years ago with a very old team""


Meanwhile ipl 2021 trophy: üòÆ",17
Woah almost 150 kmph,3
Touched 150,6
Fuckin edge merchants,10
149.9 holy üíÄ,12
"Bruh, a CSK bowler bowling 150ks üò≠ my wet dream",20
DDP was a hero. I just couldn't see it.,3
Pathirana is lethal,7
One Fifty!,6
Lmao pure shitshow,3
This is some insane amount of luck,5
DDP the Edges Master..,5
That ball was 150kph üíÄüíÄ,6
Padikkal is the new hetmeyer,3
Two good balls two boundaries cricket is unfair sometimes....,5
In our gully cricket this kind of bowling action is called War,3
DDP the best finisher of this lineup clearly,3
Is that a bat or a knife,1
Wow again,1
how is this guy's bowling action even legal ????,-4
Padikkal had saving up all his luck for this match,5
French cut of highest order,1
Edgikkal,3
DDO with french cuts,2
"Get hits for a boundary 

Smiles

And they say he isn‚Äôt malinga",28
DevLuck paddikkal,11
What luck these idiots have,12
Hurts to see good yorkers getting punished,23
Padikkal living on the edge,12
Great shot from DDP. Great use of the pace!,2
"Beautiful ball, great save nice 4",1
"Very unlucky for Pathirana, these could have been 2 wickets with a bit more luck.",4
How does RR have less confidence in Holders batting than Parag‚Äôs batting,1
Man that's so unlucky,7
Why DDP why?,3
2 perfect deliveries going for boundaries ffs,4
Padikkak be like... Man I am so goood,6
"Jurel playing like DDP

DDP playing like Jurel

Halla Bol, halla Bol, halla Bol!",4
DDP decreased his skill meter in exchange for the luck meter,10
DDP French cutting his way to greatness,7
Best 2 boundaries I've ever seen in my life,5
CSK need to restrict Rajasthan and get one more than them to win this game,2
"The speedgun is definitely off today lol, Deshpande was supposedly bowling 146/147",4
Just so you know this is the CSK not having its strongest complete 11 with Deepak and stokes injured.,3
Such sweet edgers of the ball these guys...,7
Touch and go,3
"Do you believe in UFO?

Next question 

Insiders is the scene lmao",7
150 kmph???????,9
What in the Gas man Pathirana,7
150 holy shit,9
"Fuck man, such good balls going to the boundary is sad to see",9
"149.9 v 150 kph is the new 5'11"" vs 6'",14
Bottled a 200+ score successfully,8
This guy is better than Bumrah,2
Instead of playing padikkal at no 6 better to play someone else or even parag rather than making padikkal play out of his spot and self sabotaging themselves,2
"he is bowling yorkers left, right and centre at 150ks. Good luck KL 2.0",14
"Pathirana deserves a wicket here, bowling absolute gas",25
Always maintained Edge is most productive shot in T20s,8
Ddp somehow making boundries. Damn,8
This Pathirana lad is so wholesome to watch.,14
Pathirana yorkers are crazy consistent,23
Padikkal doesn't know what Padikkal is doing,8
devdutt padikkal should declare himself out to uphold the spirit of cricket. 8 runs for those 2 balls is such a tragedy,11
"DDP has no clue what hes doing! Hitting London, going Tokyo!!",5
What does Shaun and Bishop means by the ball tailing in the pitch?,2
Malinga is not impressed. LOL,4
If Rahane takes over CSK captaincy will be be called Baby Thala ?,3
What biryani and muscles?. This kid just bowled a 150kmph,8
I am having 2014 vietnam flashbacks.,3
DDP putting away those beautiful yorkers for boundaries tf,7
"0-28 in 3 overs is an absolute injustice to how he‚Äôs been bowling‚Ä¶ 3 edges (inside, outside, top üíÄ) for boundaries in the last 2 overs",9
Man pathirana unlucky,6
Lord parag not playing?,3
"Bowling on fire, the fours were unfortunate",7
Padikkal more like Padilluck. Ban edges in CSK matches ffs.,3
Scorecard will suggest DDP played a blinder here,3
"
Bishop said it right, Pathirana seam position will make the ball tail in and drop down. It‚Äôs insane bowling",6
Bruh those Yorkers,9
[deleted],7
Devboundary Edgikal,5
180-190 won't be enough sadly. RR have totally bottled it after a great start.,3
Good yorkers  but few players can play scoops... How will he bowl to them is the real test...,4
DDP finisher,1
"Tu dal dal mai pat pat


T:Newtons 3rd law",1
RR got the best of luck today,6
"RR's batters have had a lot of luck today, but they've also been good enough to make full use of it.",2
Put Pathirana's stats in a AI machine and it'll tell you to drop him. But we know how good he's been today!,6
Padikkal masterclass,3
According to people this was also luck..,4
Pathirana is only 20!,7
Still looking like a 200 score,2
HAHAHAH I AM DONE üòÇüòÇ,4
No one's ready for this version of DDP üíÄ,4
I think DDP has finally found his perfect spot,4
"He's crazy like a fool, Devdutt Paddikool.",2
DDP redemption arc,3
Akash Singh is really bad fielder,2
"Guys what do you enjoy more?

Dhoni vs Malinga wc 2011 final

Kohli vs Malinga 2012 Hobart (he smacked 24 runs off Malinga)",4
"chennai just unearths diamonds man,
he is gonna be bigg.
got unlucky that over but it was really good bowling",5
RR will get 190 if they score 24,1
Ok shit fucked again now RR is back in this game,3
[deleted],4
The Birth of a Finisher.,3
DDP is Micheal Bevan of this generation,6
Pretty good over rate. Just over 1.5hrs for the innings.,2
Supla shot from DDP. I have seen everything now.,6
"Padikkal: Look at me, I‚Äôm the finisher now",4
nice batting even with better bowling,1
Bruh what's happening.,1
Super excited for the KL derby tomorrow,3
Thanks to JioCinema I‚Äôd forgotten Akash Chopra exists in the Hindi commentary box. Thanks to their shit app design it crashed and automatically switched to Hindi and I got reminded again.,9
ddp why are you doing this today of all days,1
Omfg. What am i seeing,1
Go DDP! You are talented. Don‚Äôt let them tell you otherwise. ü´∂üèª,1
Good for DDP after some slow innings,2
Wide tonks begin,2
I have never understood why don't they just bowl at the stumps when the batter moves across,1
DDP playing a blinder üò≠üò≠,6
Padikkal bro its inside the line,5
RR fans rn: I owe you an apology. I wasnt really familiar with your game.,4
"Pathirana and Arjun, 2 finds of this IPL.",4
Padikkal the finisher is here.,1
Lets see if he follows the lord‚Äôs legacy of taketh away and giveth away,3
"I played with ABD, i can do shixt too. See....",3
I like this new inventive DDP!,3
"These RCB fans have crossed the line in dissing Padikal 

And he decides to prove himself today.",2
Finisher Padikkal in the making,2
Almost 144kmph for Deshpande. Where is his praise?,5
"Therapist: Finisher Padikkal isn't real, he can't hurt you

Finisher Padikkal:",9
Definitely RRs game,1
As an RR fan I broke up with my girlfriend because she told me to Holder,5
Not a Wide,2
Pathirana would have ruled baseball if he was a pitcher.,5
How come Pathirana doesn't play for Sri Lanka? Has he gone the franchise player route?,3
Either this pathrina will get go for 30 over run at some point,5
[removed],7
DDP with nearly 200 sr what the fuck,4
r/cricket ain't ready for this ddp uno reverse,5
Paddikal showing dhruv how it's done,3
garbage review,1
"Honestly Pathirana, Theekshana and Deshpande have been very good at the death.",6
All these inside edges,2
RR fans why are you a RR fan ?,2
"I hope hety didn't peak early in the tournament, RR need him at the end, this is where they are struggling in the last 3 matches",2
Padikkal using all his luck,5

Wtf so lucky this mf,5
Bruh how lucky is this Padikkal üíÄ,3
"Wtf is Murali Karthik talking about

Someone get him off comms",5
Some top level Physics knowledge being dispersed by commentators!,9
Devdutt score in front of the wicket challenge (Impossible).,7
How did CSK end up top of the table with this bowling line up lol?,2
The edges man,2
How can this man be this lucky,4
PLAY WITH THE FULL FACE OF THE BAT CHALLENGE (IMPOSSIBLE),1
Why's Murali Kartik waffling about kinetic energy,3
Legendary commentary on insiders ft. Swanny,4
Finally a proper boundary,3
Swanny is just another r/cricket shitposter who happened to play International cricket,12
Swanny's stock post IPL gonna be off the roof,7
Kinetic became static,6
Hard hit,1
Soild sound it made,2
I swear I hate KP right now,4
Loving these guys,1
KP vs MK on injuries,2
if we somehow manage to get them to less than 200 i would be happy,2
What a shot chudel,-1
"KL 2.0: hitting down the ground is overrated, i'll hit behind the wicket",2
Murali Karthik stfu dude,4
jurel is goooood!,2
Pathirana is pure vibes. Bro is shadow batting waiting for decision üòÑ,9
RR's score without scoring off inside edges: 58.,5
Shut the fuck up you baldy kartik you know shit,8
"The umpires have a mutual non-aggression pact, no wide will be overturned unless it hits something.",0
Nice shot,1
Jurel you absolute legend,2
Can someone physically drag Murali Kartik out of the commentary box,11
Kinetic energy static energy üò≥,4
Dhruv Jurel is find of the IPL for me this year...absolute gun of a player.,5
Sexy shot,1
Which country is Jurel from?,2
That 6 was a Thala shot,2
INSIDER COMMNS BE MY ONE OF FAV GENDER,7
Jurel looks like the next SKY tbh. Very confident and some clean striking.,4
Bruh Jurel is oozing that panache.,1
Mf murali kartik is literally me during physics exam,2
Jureeeeeeeeeeeeeel ü•≥,2
I have masters in physics and this is all new to me,2
Jurel has already done more than 4 years of Samad.,7
What's a good score in this pitch. I think 190 would be the par score,2
"Murali Karthik says, Kinetic Energy becomes static at the point of release of the ball. Nithyananda physics at display!",6
"Thakur is a title of nobility where as Deshpande is a district level accountant/revenue collector. Hence, Thakur >> Deshpande",2
swannie and his antics have become one of the highlights of ipl for me over the years.,3
"Dhruv Jurel is a revelation, Fuck Parag",8
"Jurel- enough with the edges, have some meat of the bat",3
Murali Kartik: I am a bit of a scientist myself,1
Fuck he's so goodü•µü•µü•µ,1
Pathirana is the only one standing between RR getting 200+,3
"With those shots and those looks, Jurel might soon get a non-gambling ad deal",5
"""Cosmic energy coupled with atomic energy"" kinda explanation going on there",1
We need Padikal in strike,1
This Jurel is really promising,2
Dhruv Jurel is definitely the find of the season by Impact player rule,3
It's like Shardul Thakur never left. Just came back in the form of Tushar Deshpande...,8
Jurel is clutch,2
Jurel on fire,1
Pls get this over done.,1
Batsman hitting sixes while chewing gum is Sigma vibes,2
Dhoni must be lowkey nostalgic of Jurel's bat lol. That's my first memory of Dhoni - long streaky hair and a reebok bat,9
CSK have lost this match. Can't blame anyone but their rotten luck.,4
Where is that idiot who was comparing Jurel to Pan Parag a while ago,8
You cannot bowl this length in the 19th over.,7
"Deshpande is the consistency king


11.32",2
Deshpande serving up tasty slot balls,8
Dude bowled a slot ball.,7
This is why Jurel needed all the strike against Deshpande.,8
"how tf does murali kartik still commentate, dude is shit",3
With all these new players SL will be going back to their 2011 days strength...,6
Jurel has been such a valuable find for RR,6
Yo! I feel CSK will comfortably win this.,2
"Straight wala ""sixy"" sabse saxi! 

Doesnt work? Ok then...",7
Mahi Bhai aap bhi ek baar Reebok se batting karo pls üëâüëà,2
what a clean strike... we are finding so clean strikers this season,3
Jurel has impressed a lot. If not for the impact player rule he would be sitting out,9
tbh i have no expectations from this match so i'm just vibing with whatever,4
"Dhruv Jurel is the future, not the Rahane bloke you‚Äôre all gushing about.",-4
I love Ian Bishops lil nuggets of history on the players,6
dream for rcb middle order,4
Why does it always seem like our non top 3 batsmen play like they‚Äôve just now learnt to pick up a bat while other teams‚Äô batsmen play like they have a decade+ of experience?,5
"Malinga said his injury was cured by a famous spiritual doctor in Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa helped him financially",6
ppl fed up with murali karthik just switch to insiders commentary to see swann flaunting his level 2 umpiring certificate :),6
Dhruv Jurel has done really well in whatever chances he has got. Has been one of the better Indian batters down the order in this edition,8
"Man this is an IPL match, the bowlers slowed them down but the batsmen coming back boldly. Worthy opponents.",2
Dhruv Jurel what a revelation he has been,3
Every match deshpande gives 40+ runs .. wtf man,4
Jurel is what Pan Parag thinks he is,6
Why can't we have our own jurel or tilak or yashasvi ü´†ü´†ü´†,4
"Jurel is the best example of impact player, came in bcoz of sub rule played 3 good shots and got in 11",3
Jurel times the ball so well he's got the gillesque sound to his bat,3
Dhoni slandering his teammates in the field today lmao,3
Jurel is great timer of the ball,1
Deshpande is giving me a hard time with all these mixed signals....i can't decide whether i should love him or hate him,6
Bro why do rcb have such shit indian players ? So jealous of these teams fr,7
jurel > badoni,4
Dhruv Jurel >>>>>>>>>> Pan Parag,7
Bish: don't make me cry bro,5
Jurel over Samson would've made rr to 200,4
"Dread it, run from it, Deshpande 10+ economy arrives all the same.",10
"Jurel,Rinku,Tewatia & Jitesh can be groomed to be out & out finishers for India. They‚Äôve been hella consistent too",3
Yes Jurel. Back yourself more plz. Keep the strike.,5
"Ian Bishop really shining through with his research on lesser known players as well

Murali Kartik on the other end waffling on about kinetic energy for some reason",9
Rahane is as good as jadeja in field,3
Wonder if they did a poll of who's the shittest commentator how many people would jump on to vote,6
then dad got his mistress to move in,2
Shot,3
"Jurel please lend a bat or two to MS, I want Reebok MSD back",6
"Rutu 70
Convey 70
Rahane 60",5
Ian Bishop is such a Class Act for learning that story of Dhruv Jurel.,5
All that momentum CSK had gone,2
Oh the pain as an RCB fan watching young Indian middle order batsmen doing so good.,3
The sacrifice Jurel‚Äôs parents made is incredible!,3
Jor el supremacy,2
"Jio you assholes, I missed the whole run up",5
"I have huge respect,  I really do. But hindi commentary in CSK matches just praising him endlessly every 3 balls....i mean no analysis on situation just dhoni , dhoni, dhoni.....every time i have switched to watch when CSK field .... it's just dhoni's Praise nothing else",6
Jurel is a special player. His ability to hit the ball long from ball one is gonna come in clutch.,5
That was a fuck all ball lol,2
Rare bad ball by Pathirana.,2
Anything below 200 and CSK wins.,4
If only Indian commentators did their research like Ian Bishop,5
Dhruv was warming the bench for lord parag lmao.,7
Rare Pathirana Pie,2
No ball?,2
BRO JUREL HITTING HARD,2
What a find this Jurel guy,4
MY GAWD DHRUVV,3
"Okay why was ever a guy like jurel in subs, tf",11
Binga trying to wrestle Swanny for his Umpiring license on Insiders. Dugout was the best thing that ever happened to the IPL,7
Jurel is amazing.,4
Jurel is such a big upgrade from Riyan my god.,6
Wow!! Strong strong finish by RR,2
DJ gives SKY vibes sometimes,1
"Jurel is the best revelation of this season and it isn't even close.

An uncapped player batting like an elite finisher in the toughest phase of t20 cricket.",4
It's always the Reebok bat,2
Tushar Deshpande try to go for less that 40 runs challenge (impossible),3
Jurel is what Riyan claimed he was.,2
I'm gay for Rinku n Jurel,4
"The MVP for the views ain't thala, it's csk death bowling",2
Jurel you're fuckin amazing brother. Your attitude is exactly what a finisher needs.,3
Reminder that Jurel also keeps for UP,5
Jurel is the guy RR ownership thought Parag was for about 3 seasons,12
Want to see Root,4
Reebok bat what else do you need?,2
Need 20 runs here,2
2 more sixes,3
Finisher extraordinaire indeed!,5
He's been the find of the season,6
People getting paid for talking about kinetic energy in cricket match ‡ºé‡∫∂‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†‡ºé‡∫∂,4
I highly doubt CSK can chase this against this RR attack.,8
So unlucky man,4
I can't believe they played that pan parag this long and kept jurel back.,5
That was first bad ball from Pathi ....,3
Jurel masterclass,3
That Jurel backstory is heartouching.,7
Using 2 young Indian top and middle order batters as finishers RR you won't see heaven,2
Jurel is the guy. And tewatia. Want them to get a chance in T20.,1
"Top 10 rappers Eminem is too afraid to diss:

1. Bish speedrunning Jurel biopic while the ball is returned to bowler",4
"Damn, Ian narrating Jurel's story made me emotional af",3
Dhruv is too good,0
You had my curiosity.....but now.... YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION,2
Remember y'all this guy was the find of El Clasico,6
I'm a certified MILJ supporter (man I love jurel),1
bro luck is incredible today,6
How the fuckkk? Fucking edgelords,8
Jurel has a swagger about him.,4
Where the fuck does Rajsthan find these young talented cricketers. First was Shane Warne and now these.,10
A young finisher with a Reebok bat. I have seen this before,6
RR have had so much luck here.,9
Luck with RR completely,11
Jurel no,4
Fucking edge merchants,9
How are they so unlucky lol,4
Rare bad shot from him,3
"Jurel jurel jurel      
You are a T20 marvel",2
Padikkal's innings just once again shows how shit most popular opinions on this sub are,3
Im a fan of jurel ngl,5

Law of averages catching up to csk with this rotten luck lmao,4
If someone randomly watch this scorecard will think Pathi is having bad day but man is bowling hai best.....,11
Hands in pants... ü•µ,2
Tushar transferring some of his energy into the ball so that pathirana can get hit as well.,4
Pathirana was unlucky and got 3 edge boundaries. The worst thing is people will ask him to be dropped.,12
Jurel pacing his innings real well. Took time to set in and now blasting away.,1
Dhoni getting blinded today seeing the spark of Jaiswal and Jurel. Only Parag's darkness can heal him,5
This is not csk's game for sure,2
"How is UP not champs?

They have Jurel, Rinku,",5
to think we kept pan parag for so long instead of Jurel.,6
Pathirana seriously unfortunate today..,9
Bring in fine leg and third man,2
"Dhruv Jorel is a great talent. India willl pick him, make him play 2 innings and drop him for a 120SR batsman",3
Good thing I invested all my life savings into the Jurel stock early,3

This rr is winning the cup this year,2
Pathirana has been very unlucky today.,9
"The speedgun seems to be correct now, a bowler doesn't go from 150 to 135 on effort balls lol",3
Why would you take a single for fuck's sake man,6
Theekshana probably needs fielders placed finer. His yorkers are faster so edges are also flying off to the boundary.,8
Lol Pathirana has been really unlucky today.,7
RR camp should make Parag Masala watch this inning of Jurel videos on loop.,2
This isn't fair man lmao,4
Jurel you needed to hit every ball ffs. What was that tuk.,-1
"Man didn't commita mistakes. But on a batting pitch bowling 150 is not good.

This is where Bravo kinda bowlers shine",2
"Jaiswal, Rutu and Jurel deserve to be in the T20I squad!!",5
Youngsters killing it for RR today,3
It just keeps getting worse,3

So frustrating for pathirana,6
Why don‚Äôt they invite Sanju and Gavaskar to Insiders,3
I thank the impact rule for this,3
RR have been pretty lucky so far,9
RR is going to choke CSK hard with their bowling today.,7
Pathirana's slower deliveries are being bowled at 135 kph.,13
terrible luck for pathirana,16
Jurel >>>> Riyan,11
"For unknowns, there is a subreddit for folks who are afraid of Thala and his Thalaserry!

Are there fines for director/third umpire sleeping on the job,2
Bruh this man has ascended goodhood,8
The greatest ever,3
Time for Ashwin to come in and hit a six,3
Send holder!!,1
New comic book hero DC Jurel,1
At this point Hindi commentary guys should just give a BLOWJOB to dhoni....the endless praise is too fucking boring,2
I mean yes editing takes time,1
Ashwin Anna the finisher walks in for the final balls.,6
Meanwhile Parag asking what‚Äôs all this hype about jurel,8
"Thala lookin sexy AF in this hairstyle and beard

*unzips*",7
Need confidence like this on field umpire in life,3
Every WK in the league taking notes agressively,5
The speed cam is hanging by a rope and the wind is adding 10 kph to the actual speed,2
"""I've made my decision""",2
**‚Äú*Thala can hit on any girl*‚Äù**,3
There will never ever i mean literally never be a better Keeper or Captain than Thala Dhoni,7
Dives to collect the ball and still runs him out,8
Just letting you know GT bidded for Riyan Parag till 3.6 crore,7
"MS is like, fine I am going to do this myself now. Enough of this shit luck against such good bowling.",7
"Our national team should be looking at having the likes of jaiswal, Rinku, jurel, jitesh & ruturaj in the pool for T20s. 

These guys play the T20's in the new age manner rather than trying to adapt to the modern game.",6
They're not trusting Holder,1
Ruined my bro's average üòî,1
Now Let‚Äôs see DK doing it,6
Jurel is so much better than Parag.. its not even funny.,4
"Getting windy 

Will help Sandy 

Deathrattleporn incoming",3
madman thala,1
Opening and slog overs are utter crap,4
Beautiful innings by Jurel,2
"It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve seen a Reebok bat

The long haired Dhoni days when he scored 183 at this same ground come to mind üò¢",6
Jurel winning hearts what a knock,7
Dhoni still does this casually ...,7
Why taking so much time.,2
"This is like last season where in a game Nortje clearly bowled a slow cutter and the speedgun showed 150 lol

Coincidentally, Umran also hit 157 in that game, while in internationals 148/149 seems to be his peak. IPL speedguns often act wonky",7
okay I was on edge now I'm also thalason,3
That‚Äôs the üêêthe üêê,6
Ashwin's ass would have saved the wide there,1
"""premium toh free hain, tu free hain?"" 

someone slap the writer of this ad.",6
"Dhoniüòébest keeper in the world for a reason...

Gilchrist comes far second.",5
Jurel and Jitesh. Most exciting uncapped prospects.,8
"""He does it with the gloves or without the gloves""

Didn't know MK is an Osvaldo fan",3
Now Ash Anna coming with new batting technique,4
Unnecessary dismissal considering DDP is in form too.,6
Lazy running imo but great innings by jurel. This bloke is player to watch out for.,8
Ashwin 2 ball 12!!! ü§û,3
Rr recovered well.,7
"Fair play to Dhruv for walking off instead of just standing there like everyone does, even in more obvious situations than this",48
"Given their start, middle over choke and then late charge, I'd say RR are 10-15 runs short.",5
Dhoni is still  best wk  . Ishan Kishan should learn,8
True to his name,5
Watching Jurel-DDP is like watching Dhoni and Bevan together. Two greatest finishers of this gen üêês,-7
Sanga English accent doing wonders for Padikkal,1
DDP the Glance Master.,1
wonder what would have been Pan Parag's antics on the field if he managed the same amount of run as Jurel today,12
Cummed so hard that My mobile screen ain't working anymore after that throw from thala,5
Threading needles through wicketkeeper and fine leg,4
Hahaha DDP madlad,2
Would be interesting to see padikal‚Äôs wagon wheel.,4
I'm so done with this shit,2
Let's come back stronger punchi Mali,6
Bro these mfing edges.,6
Edgelord Padikkal,7
DDP 's scoring in reverse V,6
"dread it, run from it, 200 target still arrives",8
bruh Padikkal has springs on the edge of his bat or something?,11
"Padikkal scored all his boundaries of either inside edge, outside edge or top edge.",7
"Pathirana has had some incredibly shitty luck today, so many edges going for 4. He could have easily ended up with 3-25 or something like that with a bit more luck.",19
"If they didn‚Äôt have deep third, that would have been 4",1
All padikal runs r edgesü§£ü§£ü§£,10
Average score here is 157,6
Wow what a flick from DDP!,2
RR has Luck as their Impact sub.,8
Highest ground in IPL history so far here.... Csk fans be like ü•≤,6
Every edge is flying with that speed,7
Man they really trust holder's bowling skills,5
Is that chewing gum the secret to Jurel‚Äôs jawline?,8
Padikkal yea humble us brother,2
THANK TO US WE GOT YOU POWER HITTER PADDIKAL JUST LIKE DUBE,13
Ddp's luck today..,13
dDP's boundary tracker would be the most interesting. Everything behind th stumps lol,18
Padikkal's favourite shot is the inside edge,12
Bole Jo Koyal,0
Highest score at Jaipur,2
"Out by two yards, direct hit with no fielder around, square umpire in perfect position and YET goes to 3rd umpires. These idiots should be penalised for their total laziness and incompetence",10
Bro where are the fielders,0
aaah 200 was inevitable i guess,4
Fucking Dedbutt Testikkal living on luck,6
This has to be the highest proportion of runs scored behind the stumps for a 20+ score right???,30
Even padi is a better finisher than parag,26
DevGOAT,6
that field set behind the wicket lol,9
**‚Äô*Finally Jaipur ground‚Äôs 200 virginity lost*‚Äô**,59
As I said 200 is achieved,2
How tf Ashwin ran three,12
This is absolute shit. This game is gone,5
Wow .. they ran 3 that's commendable,9
lmao dube ran like a fucking snail,7
Browin going to run through CSK today.,3
DDP did his job and then some..,6
CSK to chase this under 19 overs,6
CSK winning in 19.5,4
Is it going to rain there?,2
can we ban edges,12
200 crossed BC moral victory,9
200 breached ü§Ø,5
WIND BUT NO BOULT FUCKFUCK,7
Dube pls score century to make up for that throw,10
Mahi is so gonna cunt these MFs today,10
CSK gonna score 195 and lose by 7 runs.,7
Inb4 CSK 150-10,1
DDP ate lucky toffee before the match,9
Dhoni fuming,13
It doesn't make any sense how pathirana has conceded more than deshpande,18
Unlucky Pathirana,11
"What a fucking finish by DDP, To come that low and play well (albeit he was lucky)",7
"CSK please I beg

Ms at 3",5
"203 chase vs 12 overs of spin 

Naww",8
Dube should just be subbed out during fielding,8
"Gonna be a difficult chase..

Need a special inning from Spin basher Dubey Jee",7
Seems like RR day today! So many edges going to boundary.,6
Crossed 200 let's goo Rahane can't chase the total in the powerplay anymore,3
Feeling bad for Pathirana man he really deserved a wicket or two,22
"yaar pathirana just shouldn't have more than 10 avg, its just not fair, bowled so many beauties, 150kmph yorkers man cricket is brutal",16
Definitely edges have the second highest score this innings,10
DDP 200 SR..!,3
Strong winds denied maximum,6
"Padikkal has actually been pretty good this season, even though he's being played in weird positions",7
"Pathirana giving his heart out, only for scorecard watching experts to diagnose him with one match wonder.",31
200 virginity of SMS deflowered successfully after 15 years of IPL,14
Only Dube could have let Ashwin run 3 there lol!,19
What's rr problem with holder? He tonks sixes doesn't he?,7
Why every one is saying Padikkal is lucky?,7
Luckiest 25+ run inings in IPL,13
I believe....,3
Padikkal been superb for RR since last 2 games,4
"Pathirana feel for you da but don't let this pull you down, absolute gun bowling today didn't click üò•",12
The wind is strong,3
Dhoni‚Äôs death stare >>>>> Koach‚Äôs death stare,14
Even paddikal is better finisher than that mr. comeback choker,6
Padikkal the finisher!,3
Cruel game this for the bowlers. Patheerana bowled so well,9
"Dhoni is reacting like a normal person to misfields. 
Which feels so off and wrong lol.",9
"Inside part of Padikkal's bat edge is made up of rubber and outside part is covered by some wood, so all he had to do is edge the ball and it fly to boundry.. That's the secret why he scoring runs..",12
Highest ever score at this venue. Get the W & move back to the top pls.,3
It drizzled a bit in the evening in western parts of Rajasthan as per news,2
Testikkal cashing in on all his luck today. Dw Pathirana will be a T20 legend while you remain  a journeyman on the domestic circuit,1
Hmm....200 on slow pitch....going to be a tough chase unless long levers Dube strikes again,0
"Said it last season as well IDK why RR bought Padikkal when they already had retained Jaiswal and Buttler. He's a pure opener and RR are trying to convert him to a middle order batter because they paid a million dollars for him.

Someone needs to free him from RR's shackles",7
[deleted],-1
Man love to see when only 2 indian uncapped players performed and got the score to 200,3
If this amount of edges went on while CSK batting people would've called it fixed....,7
Csk are only home bullies.,-14
This could‚Äôve been a 215 if Samson didn‚Äôt waste those balls earlier on,2
"If one player can play the role of Krishna from the IPL, it can be Shivam Dube. Divine looks!",6
"Rahane's old team Vs. Rahane's new team...

Lets see where loyalty really lies..",6
Hope we don't fuck up our NRR,6
Always nice to see Dhoni getting angry. If even the supposedly coolest guy can get angry then who are we,8
"Pathirana getting so unlucky so many different ways. Lol.

Most of these edges goes up most days and WK catches it. But goes for 4s at fine leg today.",27
CSK gave away like 15-20 runs more than they should have,8
With the kind of start rr got.. mumbai would have conceded 260 or something,8
Murugan ashwin impact sub. 16 overs of spin. Game over.,4
Last 3 over 50 runs scored,2
Pathirana ending up with a worse Economy than Deshapande feels wrong,7
Seems like all luck üçÄ on RR side. Amazing inning from jaiswal and jurel though,4
Malinga 4 overs 44 runs man wtf he is like best pace bowler from CSK.....,4
1st time 200 crossed at Sawai Mansingh. Would be interesting to see if Ajinkya can continue his form against 3 world-class spinners.,4
Not sure what I expected from us today but elite finisher DDP wasn't it,5
"*""I've made my decision. Kindly turn off my mic and let me fap to this.""*",3
Pathirana is very unlucky today . Leaked atleast 20 runs off edges,15
RR's bowling is monstrous. No way CSK does this,3
Pathi Rana is like me trying to impress my crush in highschool - the more I tried the worse it got,2
36 of the last 2 overs.,2
Finisher Padikkal seems to be a perfect role for him. Comes in and has one job and not worry about building innings.,3
"Dube is given a death warning, Dube will come back hunting RR with his bat to redeem",7
i dont see csk winning this at all but some entertainment would be nice (means don't lose pathetically),3
Conway vs Boult will be interesting to watch,-2
Now watch Holder leak runs as a Bowler. Can't RR just get Root for once and have someone else like Sen bowl. Sen is so fucking good in terms of uncapped indian bowlers,2
Rematch of Sandeep sharma vs Dhoni loading,3
Basically need to copy that field Kanos used to setup for Umran in the last season.,5
"Even on the day when Samson, hetmyer and even Buttler didn't contribute much, it's reassuring that we crossed 200",7
"Kuldip yadav as impact sub, that would be 16 overs of spin",1
Padikkal's Scoring Areas going to be interesting,5
This stadium brings out the fire in Thala. What is it about Jaipur?,3
Ok guys seriously who is winning,1
"Buttler, Samson and Hetmyer together have scored 52 in 48 balls...",3
"If any team is going to chase it, it's CSK . But will be really hard with RR's bowling",2
Rahane knows sms all too well....,2
Inb4 gaikwad 0(4),-2
"RR without the unbelievable luck would have been around 180 today, they got nearly 20-25 off edges that RR's batters had no clue about.",5
Poor pathirana balled so many Yorkers only to see it go for 4,14
"18th over - 13 runs ddp (10) jurel (3)

19th over - 16 runs ddp (5) jurel (11)

20th over - 20 runs ddp (8) jurel (11) ash (1)

So effectively rip Parag's career in rr.",6
jaiswal is smiling internally,2
"say what you wanna say, pathirana bowled really well.
Just unlucky.
made me a fan with his fiery bowling
Any other day all those boundaries could have been wickets.
Ian Bishop is fan of him, by the words he says about it too",13
"Finally devdutt  has shown his intent .jurel is amazing .

I think riyan got more hate because of his smugness ,like if he has underperformed  and remained bit humble ,you would have been noticed . But persisting  with riyan was bad decision  for rr",3
Pathirana figures are lieing hard,12
RR might have blue balls from the amount of edging they have done,11
"If not for the absolute dogwater innings by sanju, Rajasthan would've crossed 210",1
Will be a tough chase but this is the game for Rutu get back into the god form he was in during the first 2 games,9
WE GOT DUBE PADDIKAL RINKU JUREL TILAK IN FORM AND LIST GOES ON,1
Two Ashwins playing today it looks like. What can go wrong,4
"This is real good batting from RR..
A game where Samson Buttler and hetmyer didn't perform but still managed 200.",12
Pathirana you are a star!,8
Evil DevDot Testikkal,1
48-0 does not justify how pathirana bowled today. Man was unlucky.,17
Dhobi getting beat up on a track which does not aid spin,-6
Jaiswal and Jurel did well,2
I mean just look at him. Being all humble and everything.,5
Hope hai bro CSK jeetega but ab darr lag aha hai,3
AjinXya below a score of 10 today.,-3
Proper cunting by jurel. Finally someone cunted this shit bowling lineup properly what they deserve.,3
Thala was angryAF,3
India has so many young players who have only played a couple or no matches for India that flourish in the ipl. Could probably make a strong 11 out of just those players,3
Baby Malinga performing like washed up Malinga...,-9
Dhoni‚Äôs T-shirt has a number 7. TFAR,1
Did dhoni really giving a death stare?,2
"Great little knocks by Jurel and Paddikal. Thanks Jurel...you will help yo keep the RR lovechild Pan Parag out. RR benefiting from selecting the right team, finally.",6
Jaiswal is a treasure for the team. Kid is just 21 but some mature batting display. Hope he gets a shot at the Indian team soon.,4
"RR are so lucky, they got about 20 runs thru edges in the last 3-4 overs",3
"A very level headed interview from Jaiswal here, very impressed with his composure especially when he spoke about RR's chances.",7
first 200+ score at this stadium. CSK gonna need a special effort to chase this.,4
"Ashwin chahal zampa


Dis gonna get some doing ....",5
WHY NO BOULT ? WIND AND BOULT WOULD BE A DEADLY COMBO,2
i dont know who's gonna win this time but I have a gut feeling its gonna go towards RR's court,2
Honestly total is beyond CSK with the large stadium and 3 spinners. RR selections always spot on unlike CSK. Santner should have played here instead of Moeen.,5
Just came back from an errand. Can someone tell me if pathirana ever crossed 149 or not?,4
At least all runs Jurel scored were intentional. Hope DDP used up all the luck of RR.,4
This is one match where a bowler‚Äôs (pathirana) bowling figure doesn‚Äôt show how well he bowled,14
Wow this game is really cruel. Csk management won't drop pathirana but armchair experts will demand his crucifixion in post match threadüòî,7
So rr is winning then,3
CSK must've missed Pan Parag,7
RR 37 dot balls,3
Jurel had more intent and better performances in 7 games than Parag in his entire RR career.,11
Look at that Theekshana‚Äôs economy mahn!,3
"What should worry oppositions is that, twice already RR managed to score decently with their big 3 failing.

They will be a proper scary lineup once sanju and Buttler fires.",6
The best thing about Jaiswal is his intent. He always looks to score boundaries.,5
Why was Dhoni angry?,3
Deshpande is terrible at slog overs Shardul and Bravo atleast takes wicket this guy is total crap,1
Dhoni used up his angry quota for this season in this game only.,4
"Good score, now who'll defend this lol.

Why isn't Boult playing if Holder isn't going to bat.",3
Jana Gana Mana.,5
RR never had to face an in-form Rahane since he left them. Hopefully it continues.,8
Tomorrow‚Äôs match between KL‚Äôstrike rate is overrated‚Äô and PBKS‚Äôpartnership is overrated‚Äô‚Ä¶ will be fun,6
fun match so far!,2
"rr scoring 200 without Samson, butter and hettie is not something that would've happened last season.   
still I wanna see how csk play. is the pitch really the same or has it been changed?",8
Hell yeah rajasthan. Make csk and dhobi suffer.,-25
On a positive note we will see dhoni bat today,4
So we'll see a high scoring PP and it'll slow down,3
One edge is unlucky. Four edges after the bowler is keen on bowling yorkers and you still not keeping your fine leg/third man fine/square is just poor captaincy.,13
Thala taking revenge on Sandeep and Puchong himself like he did in 2010.....,7
[deleted],2
Dhoni is learning how to set field for Pathirana. Too many boundaries went fine. About 15 runs  too many.,12
Need to see Dhoni bat at least 5 overs today,5
okay I am predicting Royals gonna win by about 15 runs,12
Inb4 CSK 35-3 (6),6
Gonna be very difficult chase with this RR bowling linup.,12
Those extra 15 runs off DDP's edges sealed the game for RR. I felt 185 is chaseable on this pitch.,27
"Dhoni who played his most aggressive innings here  against Pakistan 183 runs, this ground tuns cool Dhoni into angry Dhoni....üòÅ",16
"Looking forward to watch Rahane bat. I hope he continues his from, CSK really need him.",10
"If RR can get Gaikwad early this game is done. And considering the luck that RR had tonight, I can't see how RR can lose this.",9
They have four spinners? Ash Ash Chahal Zampa üò≥,16
Will the 2021 Ruturaj come forward tonight?,13
Need Conway or rutu to stay till end otherwise it's over for us,14
Hope this one of Raydu match where he goes berserk and score 70(30)......,12
Smith going at it on Parag,5
DDP's Juju charged bat put the odds back in RR's favour.,6
"If RCB had any version of  this gum-chewing Dhruv Jurel, they would be table toppers currently ü•≤",6
"Jurel has been very consistent results aside, and it's great to see that we are not dependent on foreign players as much in terms of performance.",9
"CSK ain't winning this if any one of Ruturaj, Conway or Rahane doesn't bat through.

RR have the strongest spin troika.",9
"Either CSK will win this or lose this by at least 50+, I don't see a middle ground here. Powerplay especially Ruturaj will decide which way this is going.",9
Seems only today edges have led to runs being scored,5
Flat pitch we have to win this,4
"Its been 7 straight games since a chasing side won the match.

The last side to win batting 2nd was CSK, against SRH.",13
Jurel looks like samson with better footwork,6
12 overs of hardcore spin. We are losing this,7
Today is the real test of Batdeep,10
12 overs of hardcore spin. We are losing this,15
Dhoni from captain cool to angry old manü§£ü§£ü§£,13
CSK will win,6
"As an MI fan, I want CSK to lose, but not before Daddy Rahane explodes all over this gameü•µ",-2
"RR: jaiswal, jurel, padikkal .. indian youngsters doing well",3
"M ashwin will be brought in as Impact Sub making it 4 spinning options on this big ground of Jaipur, where six hitting is inherently difficult. 
A good start in PP is crucial for CSK .",2
"I hope Sanju never fields first, we are clearly a better team while setting a target and just going guns blazing without any care of run rate or target",4
"Jaiswal has been brilliant. 

vs Super Kings- 77  
vs RCB - 47  
vs Super Giants - 44  
vs Titans- 1  
vs Super Kings- 10  
vs Capitals - 60  
vs Punjab Kings - 11  
vs Sunrisers - 54",9
"Jurel - option for Indian keeper along with Pant, Samson, Kishan",3
Something in the Jaipur air that triggers Dhoni,5
Dube - can't move feet when batting and fielding.,3
Jurel instead of Samson please,2
Let‚Äôs see if Boulto gets a first wicketo,3
[deleted],1
"holder can't be better than boult

bring him in as IP",1
Watch rahane smash his former team at his former home ground,9
"If there is a batting lineup to score 200+ against this RR attack then its GT or this CSK at current form

lets hope for a close contest",1
"I feel rr have scored 15-25 runs more than what we can chase, but if Dube/Rahane/rayudu decide to go berserk with Conway and gaikwad giving decent start we may have a chance albeit a very small chance",6
LSG RCB going to be spicy,1
Ready for a Dhoni-Jadeja masterclass running between wickets.,3
It's amazing to see even when RRs top 3 batsmen fail they can still rely on others to cross 200. Unlike some other team whose name i am not going to mention,4
CSK already lost because they don't have Santner for that last ball 6.,7
"Even though everyone didn‚Äôt maxmize individually. This is the best order RR have played all season. The one they should stick to. Butler, Jaiswal, Samson, and Hetmeyer. In that order.

Imagine if Jos and Sanju had come to the party. Would have been mayhem. And eventually they will. 

I hate the logic that the better player accommodates the weaker player in order to utilize the weaker player better. Sanju is more explosive and more complete than paddikal. Just because Paddikal is thought to be a one dimensional top order batter doesn‚Äôt mean you underutilize the better batsman Sanju. 

RR did the right thing today. Also it hasn‚Äôt come off yet, but Hetmeyer at 4 is also a golden move. He is not the slogger people think he is.",6
"All the RCB fans in comments that are crying about not having someone like Jurel in their lineup , you guys literally have Prabhudesai but your management for some reason don't wanna manage your uncapped talent properly. At least Lomror finally seems like came out of his shell last night",1
Whatever man! We saw Thala make a great runout. That's enough content for us today,6
"With difference in quality of bowling:

Pathirana:.    4 over for 48 runs 0 wicket 
Deshpande:. 4 over for 42 runs 2 wickets

ü•≤",2
"All the RCB fans in comments that are crying about not having someone like Jurel in their lineup , you guys literally have Prabhudesai but your management for some reason don't wanna manage your uncapped talent properly. At least Lomror finally seems like came out of his shell last night",13
Which team winning will make the comp more exciting?,1
Waiting for Long lever Dube and Cream it Rahane,6
I don't care about the nrr today..all I want is 2 points today.,10
No powerplay bully boult ??,2
They calling it small-ish ground and I remember reading it got one of the longest boundaries. What is it?,1
[deleted],-11
Dube vs Ash/Yuzi will be awesome to watch but Ash might have a bag of tricks ready for Dube already,2
"Damn, starting with a spinner ?",5
"Thala playing is reward enough..

anything else is added bonus",7
"Jurel: finally a India lower order batter who can hit the ball consistently. 

God knows why Parag was playing over him this entire time.",32
Why RR not picking Boult with CSK.,3
Sandeep ready for a 20 run 1st over ü•µ,5
Jail clasico,6
I have a strange feeling that CSK will choke this..,6
Sandeep Sharma to swing the ball..,3
"Come on Rutu, time to get into God mode again, second half of the tournament now",6
Kuldeep looking different?,9
"Kuldeep found DC so shit

Bro shifted to RR",11
DDP edging his way from a 120 SR to a 200 SR lmao,8
Really need a Gaikwad special if we have to have any chance.,4
that was so slow lol,2
Kuldip Yadav is here to take Gaikwad's wicket.,7
sandy against rutu is stress inducing,6
MS did not understand field settings for Pathirana today . DDP edges of Pathirana sealed it for RR today .,0
"Parag in the field, that's an absolute W. Such a gun fielder",4
Nice in swing from Sharma. Needs to bowl one that moves away to surprise the batter.,2
Rahane to score a century and Thala to win it off the last ball with a six,6
CSK fans r kings of jinxingü§£ü§£ü§£,8
First time 200 scored in ipl in this venue.. wont be easy for CSK to chase against quality spin attack,7
Seamer in when spin had more impact in the first innings?,4
Look csk if you're going to lose this then please do it in a snoozefest way...don't lose after giving a hope,8
Wow,5
"Fuck. Ash, chahal, kuldeep and zampa?? RR woke up and chose csk's spin choke.",15
Isn't hetmyer a good fielder?? Why sub him out,7
Sandy vs ms again last over????,15
Bro thought he's Ronaldo,12
Sandeep bowling 130+??,5
Ayo kuldip Yadav is a left arm pacer not a spinner üíÄ,10
I know kuldeep yadav sometimes bowls 120kmph. But can he be really considered a pacer. I thought he was a spinner.,18
The Afghan approach of 6 and nothing else in PP we saw last match won‚Äôt cut it Csk,7
man how good is jaiswal,8
These guys start slowly usually,3
"If CSK wins they kind of cements top 1 position more and gives GT good chance to be 2nd spot by a good margin even if we lose the next one. 

However if RR wins GT gets good chance to be top 1  position but we cannot lose the next one. 

I guess we should support CSK today GT bros ? I am confused üòê",6
"RR is such a fascinating squad. For every good player in thier xi they have a strong replacement on the bench. But then they have a few hole in their xi.

If rr is good at something they make it perfect and ignore their flaws completely.",13
Wait why is boult not playing today?,5
If Conway gets a 50 here he'll match the IPL record for most consecutive 50's with 5,6
"RR did really well to get 200, they looked like they were going to end up at 180 at the end of 16th. Great finish by Jurel and Padikkal",10
That was crisp,2
I thought he was Kuldeep Sen,6
Good to see KulCha back together,12
kulcha is back omg,8
Conway the *run* machine,2
How can statpad kl be not in orange cap race,7
How many Kuldeep Yadavs can there possibly be?!,6
Is on drive harder to hit than let‚Äôs say an straight drive,3
Finally no maiden over start from boult,7
"Dude why would you bowl cutters to Gaikwad, just swing it into him.",8
Watch Boult get a niggle if RR play CSK in the final.,11
Why is the outfield so patchy? Looks hideous.,1
Playing holder over boult purely as bowler doesn't make any sense,4
"4-4, 4-4",2
Imagine the collective crowd reaction if Thala walks in at 3 to reminisce his 183* at 3 on this same ground,11
I want to sit on Ruturaj‚Äôs face and suffocate him,5
"Man, Why is kuldeep yadav bowling at 130+. He was good with spin along with Chahal..",3
What is this tuk-tuk....,5
Joshila Buttler,3
Whatever happened to Kuldeep Sen? He was decent last year iirc,2
Thode der k lie waha gote,3
Boult dont want get into a show down with Devon,3
buttler now 30 (21),3
"Buttler is both a better captain and keeper than Samson, he should be having both the roles instead of Samson.",-4
KulCha 2.0,8
Shots look great. Please hit in the gap or over the field next time,9
Are these guys playing on a different pitch?,14
Why rutu why??,3
nooooooooooooooo cheeellllaaa,1
![img](emote|t5_2qhe0|8781)![img](emote|t5_2qhe0|8781),3
Gaikwad has started getting many leading edges recently. Closing the bat face too often?,5
chahal is such an idiotic fielder,5
"Thanks, Chahal",3
Chahal ffs,5
"Mom, I want Kulcha

No, we have kulcha at home

Kulcha at home:",12
Chahal üíÄ,4
Gaikwad was always safe because the fielder was Chahal.,9
We need 1st match gaikgod back for winning this,4
![img](emote|t5_2qhe0|8781),9
"Watson from Aus, Faf from SA, Moeen from Eng all have batted with a bloody knee only Conway from NZ left to complete that SENA quad.",8
Fuck it chahal,3
"Kuldip yadav comes from humble beginnings as well, beautiful story. Hope he does well today. HALLA BOL",6
Rupay GotiMuhMei moment of the day,16
"Tough one, ik it's chahal but can't still can't blame him for missing that",5
"LMAO Chahal, Theekshana etc are the exact kind of fielders you DONT WANT under such catches",14
Multiverse of kuldeep,11
Chahal shit fielder,7
Didn't Gaikwad get out like this last Match too after a shot like this,5
Lmao nobody is even pissed at Chahal because nobody even expected him to take it,40
lol it has to go to the one guy I'm fearing won't go to,5
Shreyas Iyer would've caught that,4
Come on that was an easy one wtf,2
"Calm the F train down, RUTU!",2
To all those who don't know shit and are complaining why Boult isn't playing. He has a minor injury.,9
Excellent line and length...Good find,4
Khata Oh-so-close moment,6
That shouldve been taken.,5
![img](emote|t5_2qhe0|8779),2
"You cannot hide chahal in the field.. unless you are at chinnaswami, cause it doesn‚Äôt matter there..",17
Rutu really lost his form in the process of Conway gaining it,6
Chahal Bhai has dropped most of the catches this season tho,8
Kapil > Chahal,4
i don't want chahal to get selected in odi team with his gun fielding technique,8
Yeah Chahal was running behind that ball as if he was really gonna catch it. Lol,3
"its chahal guys , cut the guy some slack",4
Looking shaky as hell.,6
"Chahal and Ashwin are such  disadvantage in the field

It's like Jadeja got all of the Indian fielding talent leaving these two lumps",18
"Chatur Chalak Chanchal Chahal.

T- Chahal is awesome.",4
Don't think anyone in the stadium expected Chahal to catch it.,3
Chahal should be an impact player.. just play when he bowls.. and throw him out..,3
We are losing it Today,2
"Man, Chahal was searching for the ball in the skies. üòÇ",7
bring ash anna in already,3
Better get out gaikwad,-1
Tbh I'd trust myself more than Chahal to take any catch,10
Someone tell Rutu they are chasing 203 not 223.,1
Boult this was not a time to have niggle should have tried eating butter chicken üçó,2
One of the major reason I don't want him to play in the WC 15 man squad even. Catches are his kryptonite.,3
Ritu spending time is always better for CSK,3
"I really thought it was the pitch 

Okay RR is awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•",5
I thought that was going to crash into the stumps,2
Wen 6 and boundaries,3
"Rutu first 3 matches - 98% middle 2% edge

Rutu today - 98% edge 2% middle",5
Why are they playing like MI against GT ?,4
"> i don't want chahal to get selected in odi team with his gun fielding technique

I dont want chahal to get selected because he is shit for india",3
Yorker at the stumps just as Ruturaj gives himself room. Love it Sandy.,7
If you lose powerplay you lose the match tbh,3
Woah! Tuk tuk academy,1
You don't drop catches like that and win the game.,3
Bowling medium pace with keeper up to the stumps is a thing needs to be done more in T20s,5
Lads go for it,3
"I don't blame chahal, his grab was poor, people shouldn't expect from his fielding",6
Last t20i vs zimbabwe in 2015,1
Should have started with dube,2
RR need early wickets. No score is too big if these two get set.,5
Now you will appreciate more what Yashaswi did here.,24
Sandeep op,2
I was trying to win the VIP tickets until Sanju Manju asked me to do it,4
Did rr steal bcci's nanobots or what,2
I fear this match is gonna destroy csk batters confidence,3
Nice bowling,1
Show shit bowling of CSK feat Deshpande and Akash,2
Lads come on we are chasing 200+,5
can this announcer or whatever he is shut the fuck up . These uh-oh are so annoying,5
Playing like they‚Äôre chasing 140 lmao,9
rahane 82*(34) incoming,3
The only catch Chahal has taken is Dhanashree,9
bruh Chahal is the Anti Buttler in the field,5
wtf was that sanju,4
Coming up while keeping is a chad move tbh,3
Man even 150 looks difficult today.,4
What did these RR bowlers have for evening snacks?..,7
Okay the PP is pretty much fucked at this point!,6
Never did I ever imagine myself being eager to watch Ajinkya Rahane bat in T20s.,17
Get rahane in ffs,5
don;t end the over with only 1 run the entire over,7
"Yea totally rooting for RR, they're playing like gold today",12
bruh 1 over run we are cooked,6
Match done RR just outplayed CSK ...,9
I never doubted RR auction strategy,9
"I am smirking, guess why",9
Sandeep sharma becomes prime Mcgrath infront of CSK,12
Devon Rahul?,3
Sandeep sharma is underrated af.,4
"Conway eats the balls all he wants as long as he stays until the 15th over, CSK would be fine.",5
~~Aramco~~ Haraamkhor Orange Cap,12
"Enough dotting lads, it's go time now.",3
The 110 abs girl sounds sus,3
Sandeep ' Malcom Mashal' Sharma,8
Dont give sandeep too much confidence or he ll nail us in the death with yorkers,6
1 run in a damn over...really?? This match is done,7
Move aside I want to see jinx batting.,4
wtf why is Samson screaming every ball?,1
"Who will be taken to cleaners within the PP tonight boys?
Need atleast 50.",1
It shouldn't be this difficult. What's happening?..,3
wtf are we doing,2
"Who will be taken to cleaners within the PP tonight boys?
Need atleast 50.",3
"With chahar being a glass , Sandy should get a proper run in t20is",4
"Dei enna thadavals pasanga target 200, 130 ille ..",2
Mfs playing for the orange cap,1
Inb4 CSK 120-10,5
Lmao what was that fielder doing before collecting the ball.,4
"We want JUSTICE

We want JUSTICE

We want JUSTICE",2
Intent where bois?,3
This might be BatDeep nrr game,1
gonna be csk's lowest pp score this season ig,6
Lads why are you tapping the ball hit it pls,3
"Took me like 3 minutes to realize that RR's bowler was ""KulDIP"" Yadav.",6
looking for singles still,2
Rahane is only hope,3
Rutu slowed down after first 2 games man.. need him to go bonkers today,6
KL jizzed his pants after seeing 3 overs from CSK,15
Does RR have the slowest pace bowling attack in the tournament?,6
Somethings got to give.. runs or wickets,2
"Boys, I think we are using Inflate Deflate strategy here.. #hopium",3
Oh my lord Conway,4
Rajasthan rocks,2
Bro what CSK doing?,6
lowest pp score for csk incoming,4
"Come on, bring in our entertainer Jinx already",4
WTF. Csk batting back to 2020,6
RR and CSK seems to be playing on a different pitch,9
About time we showed some fucking intent,9
Rahane could use pp better maybe,7
I think CSK is confident (a little over?) chasing this with their recent string of batting dominance,3
"CSK don't really have the ace bowlers but Dhoni brought the best out of them, so we knew a day would come when they struggle, it was t'day. Sanju & Co had the pleasure of doing that!",9
"Imagine someone saying,  waiting for jinx batting in T20 just a month back.",12
wtf is csk doing,10
What an ugly outfield,-1
What the hell is going on here?,3
Are the batsmen holding back or is the bowling tight?,4
CSK playing to win,1
conway mf HIT,0
"Conway reduced to slogging, lol.",5
Unrelated but there should be an anime about cricket where Sachin plays God and we get his backstory of rising but then we see how Dhoni rises as a wholesome tactician and Kohli as someone who rises as a king and other teams going up and against waiting for new era to rise.,2
Rahane wouldve scored 60 odd by now just saying /s,3
Is this how lsg fans feel,5
Jaiswal did say after the innings that it was  gripping when bowlers took the pace off.,3
Insiders exposing Conwayüò≠,3
"Told this last match as well, this ground is not the one to first get set and then think to attack. RR made the same mistake against LSG as well.",2
"RR were 64/0 after PP

CSK about to lose the match in PP",3
"This is good. Keep rahane from strike as long as possible. If these Batsmen gonna play like this, better not take a Wicket",1
Did they swap the pitch between innings?,5
40/0 in 10 overs would be the way to go chasing  203,3
KL vs Punjab tomorrow. Meme fixture.,2
"Conway and Gaikwad going slow doesn‚Äôt work. If Conway struggles, Ruturaj should start attacking",1
"Pretty good start this for CSK, we'll chase this by the 45th over. Just need to ensure that we don't lose early wickets ‚úå",5
he just needs one ball to connect with the form he is in he will be off to races but there are days like this even when you are in good form mentally,3
one of these two needs to start going now to give the middle order a chance at the very least,5
**Within a matter of 10 minutes someone switched the pitch !!!**,10
MI ü§ù CSK Bhai Bhai (having shit powerplay in 200+ chase),5
SCOTTY WIH HIS ANAYLISIS,1
 just get out do something atleast,1
Thanks MI for inspiring us on how to chase 200. Let the trolls begin!!!,3
They know the target right? RIGHT?!,6
Conway pulling a kishan,1
I am sensing a watson innings when be was silent for first 10 balls and then boom a 100.,9
Conway playing on some random line while ball is on some other line,3
I have seen atleast 7 flying edges in last 3 days,3
Is Conway alright in head? He is 6(12) ffs,2
That was just bad line from Holder,3
[removed],14
"Bruh, what black magic RR did on this pitch.",6
RR were this score at 1.2 ‚ò†Ô∏è,13
Need 20 more of that,3
"Being thrashed by RR twice this season now lmao, no option than to take this one",2
"Samson: I think we will bat first

Every Indian Captain: I didn't know you could do that",21
Holder ruined a great over,9
FINALLY.,6
"Rr need at least 75 for the last 5.
Kuldip is raw ,sandy is sandy and holder will go for at least 15 in the death.",3
I think we are in danger.. hehe,3
"Holder, hold on bro",4
proper leg side filth,2
What a terrible fucking bowl,2
Wtf is Dhawan's hair,2
bruh dont bowl holder man ;\_;,5
Holder. Whyyyyyyyy,4
RR were at this stage in 2 overs less,3
Holder freebies,4
Holder ü•∫,4
"Insiders' feed is good today.

\- Lee talking about Kuldip's delivery action and how he can get better

\- Styris talking about delay in Conway's batting lift preventing him, 

&#x200B;

That's what we want to hear, not constantly sucking off Koach, Dhoni and Tendulkars",7
"Calm down folks...just needed a 20 run over and we are good. Come on Ruturaj, your turn to take some risks.",2
Holder is such a liability in this team,5
"Hope this is one of the many from Rutu's blade tonight.
Fingers crossed.",4
Bad finish by Holder.,6
Prediction Time: CSK will win this at exact 19.4 overs.,4
I hope Punjab win tomorrow and destroy LSG. Can‚Äôt wait to see KL‚Äôs post match interview,6
What a shit ball,7
At this time RR were 54,5
holder is the new riyan,3
Dhruv is the game changer that RR thinks R Parag is,5
"Oh thank god, I forgot they were chasing 200",3
Why would you bring holder when Kuldeep was causing trouble,5
Holder seems woeful this last one year..,1
Conway is such a cucking funt,-1
It's been 84 years,3
"The pressure was building up nicely, holder giving freebies away",3
CSK win chances predictor: 7.5 %,1
"Man Holder needs to improve his bowling. Wtf was that ball. We were going so good so far. The man just released all the pressure in one over. Holder plays only as a bowler instead of All rounder, and then leaks runs like this",2
Why no Boulty?,1
Was that high enough for no ball?,1
RR benching Root for Holder SMH. Man's been shite all tournament.,3
Cunt ash for 3 sixes pls,5
Anna comes in my hope goes out,6
Conway will get out to Ash this over due to Run Rate pressure.,1
As expected. Ash Anna in. This is the end,2
Why is Kaka being so cheeky? Can‚Äôt he just take the Car out as asked?,3
i'm not surprised that rr scored 200+ our bowlers are quite bad and they have one of the best batting line-ups (if not the best) in the league. but i want csk batters to fight and lose not give up,3
Ash to get tonked or take a wicket..,2
So dumb batting gonna get out to spin now after wasting the pace overs,2
Conway is doing fine. Give him some time.,3
I'm not a violent person at all but low-key want to smack the *Main line mein nahi rukha* guy.,8
Gaikwad fucked up he should have gone with his tried tested mantra of shitting the bed in first 3-4 games and then pelting the teams there after,6
"Thanks Holder, very cool.",5
Ashwin anna gotta go for 45 for a Chennai win,5
Holder releasing all the pressure again raising the question why is he even in the team?,2
Come close guys... Dhoni will finish it offüòé,7
Mfs got super good spinners as well. How did you lose the previous matches rr,3
Ash va dubey would be nice to see.,7
"The Alia driver ad is a little offensive, don't you think? 

'Ab yeh bhi chalayenge car'. /T : Now HE will also drive a car!",9
Time to punish Ash anna,1
Ash na show some mercy üôèüôè,6
"Solid start by CSK, didn't lose early wickets. Their middle and lower order can even chase 140 in last 10 overs.",6
UmpCam‚Ñ¢,1
"Let's go Rutu, big score tonight please üëâüëà",5
Anna I love you but aaj marwa lo please.,7
Does Ashwin do that extra action to sarcastically tackle the batsmen ?..,3
RR can clearly play root and make their batting line up invincible. They have enough bowling options to replace holders.,10
Feel like Ashwin would be good at garba,9
It looks like yesterday when ana used to play for csk ms behind the stump,5
Its getting a bit nervy folks.. Hoping that Conway gets back to his good old ways...,7
[removed],10
Who is better.. Kevin Peterson or ABD?,3
Looked like a 6 to me.,4
The mandatory Anna over six.,8
"Just tuned in!

Is this the highest ever score in IPL history at Jaipur?",9
Take some wickets baigan,2
Speaking of ad while usual every ad is terrible I like they continued theif ad for jiomart and asking for lassi that was funny,5
Idk why spinner Yorkers aren't a more common ball type,4
CSKs luck is terrible today,10
Dhoni to score 183* at Jaipur?,6
Holder shouldn‚Äôt bowl any more overs. They got 4 spinners and two pacers so it should be fine.,3
I've tuned only for a rahane masterclass,1
One thing I love about these two is that they love to run 2s and 3s,8
"Whenever Anna's ball goes for a boundary, I fear for a wicket.",5
"When RR couldn't chase a score here at SMS, if CSK will, then we definitely are final contenders.",3
why the hell would you give holder the over when Kuldip did an amazing job..? RR think tank started doing their shit.,6
"Considering the size of ground, Kohli will play at a SR of 200 without any boundaries here üòÇ",9
Need a 20 run over to salvage this powerplay,3
"RR has the worst death over bowling and CSK has the best death over hitters.

Not looking good for RR.",7
This Salman Khan advert is cringy.,4
Zampa in powerplay üíÄüíÄ,2
RR missing boult here. Early wickets help more than dpt balls.,2
"Brand name - British Empire

Tagline - savour the moment",3
Time to start your engines Conway,1
10 off the first off Ash Anna is a step in the right direction for CSK,2
[removed],-5
Is this Kuldip Yadav the same Kuldip Sen? Cricinfo says Kuldip Yadav so I‚Äôm a bit unsure,3
WHAT IS IT WITH THE EDGES TODAY,4
"Zampa sa, please give few runs.",3
So today's theme is edges,6
Edges gonna backfire on RR now.,3
And the edges continue,2
"I like Zampa, need to see him play more",4
"Do you guys think the bowling speeds were little off due to air?
Can't they put some sensor inside the  ball to track that?",6
What was Zampa appealing for? üò≠,1
We need some DDP level luck today,4
"5D chess by RR to not dismiss Conway/Rutu.

Next in line is Rahane.",6
Chinese cut..,2
Conway and Gaikwad need to be strategically out right now,1
Why is Kuldip Yadav playing for RR instead of DC? Mid season transfer?,2
Nice match up there.. Zampa vs Gaikwad,1
Yes! RR got at least 5 boundaries from edges. Here's the first one back,7
Is Zampa 30? Doesn't look a day older than 19,3
This thread should be marked NSFW for the amount of edging going on in the match,8
White cheerleaders are cringy. Can't you get indian ones FFS?,3
Ball keeping lowüíÄ,1
Hates gamers Zampa does,1
Conway has to take down zampa,2
Need 4 more edges to even out the game,2
Rutu- seems like a big score coming today,2
We need 6 more 4s like that to equal the luck factor,2
Conway bc tonk or get out idiot,2
Murali karthik asks haydos why 2 spinners are bowling iq of 1000 murali karthik,2
Gaikwad is a God,1
Conway shitting the bed today,2
Such a shit innings from Conway.,2
What is Zampa appealing for? Out for a bad shot?,5
Samson is one shrewd captain. Properly attacking with the available potent options.,11
About time CSK get some boundaries off the edges,1
"RR needs to take wickets regularly or it's going to be difficult for them, CSK has a strong batting order",2
Not at all worried. Not at all. Side-eyeing Conway.,11
Jaiswal is a gentleman!,1
conway go beserk there is nothing to loose for you here now,2
Conway and Gaikwad running like vintage Warner-Kanos,7
RunRate has silently climbed upto 8 now.,3
conway is struggling big time,5
"Conway gonna stage a watson level comeback in this innings

Oh fuckkkkk",13
Devon Noway,5
Devon pls what is you doing bby,6
No Boult in both the CSK matches,3
Somehow CSK manage to get 40+ in the PowerPlay.,7
Conway is not even showing intent! Is he aware about the target?,3
"_""Ruturaj Gaikwad gonna kick himself""_",0
jesu bro you guys are trashing on conway for what?? he's scored 4 fifties consistently and he hasn't technically failed yet. give the lad some time to accelerate or if he goes out too its ok he's done well so far,16
Devon Rahul,2
Conway you shit,2
Conway playing for the DDT award,2

Hmmm. This sucks. So devastated,6
Law of averages after 4 50s in a row I guess üò¢,7
Conway thought he's Watson,2
I don't mind that at all.,3
Time to play boss music.,2
Rahane redemption incoming,3
Conway's 50 streak started with RR and ended with RR,4
RR has done their research well here... They found out that Conway has a strike rate of about 8 when the ball is hitting the stump vs 64 whan it dosent.. Here you go.. Is felt guilty of eating up the balls.. And got out..,8
"12 Run rate.

How many runs are we bottling this by ?

I hope NRR doesn't fall too low.",6
Conway was definitely not looking comfortable. Time for Rahane masterclass,6

Law of averages HAD to get to Conway,4
Who the hell was it that said law of averages?,3
Not exactly sure if we should celebrate that wicket. The guy was doing the impact innings for us with his SR of 50 in 200+ chase. Now Rahane will come. That's the main problem,3

Rahane showed his true colors once he got place in wtc final,1
That's the Rahane we know (and used to hate),8
That Tiago GF is annoying AF,4
Raydu plss play that once in a season innings today bc...,9
Form lasts only till a player is selected in squad,8
Of course Rahane fails after the selection/s,8
Csk is going down to 3rd today,2
Hopefully we get more batting time of MS today,1
Man the impact player music sounds like the final boss music in a game.,4
That NRR gonna get fucked ...,3
Rahane just gave a teaser for whats to come in WTC at the oval üî• masterpiece,10
LMFAO WTF,5
"When you need over 12.5 and bring on Rayudu lmaoooo just take the loss


Edit: instant impact hahhahaha",7
"Rayudu is only here for the good BGM, that he brings with him.",3
How did we win against RR lol,7
Don't worry guys Dubey ji will smash them just like he smashed RCB right? Right guys?,6
Sad day comrades ?,3
RR is CSKs dodgy team,6

Great impact,2
Also kudos to sanju for giving Anna is his 3rd and not going with yuzi.,4
Last time one this time zero.,1

" Yes get all of them, I want Thala to come early",2
Spinchoke,2
Yeah it's over,2
Every wicket has been the same,5
CSK really have to drop Rayudu like RR dropped Parag.,5
"Lmaooo, Conway hiding behind Fleming",5
Anna continuously destroying us,5
I said it once. I will say it again. Don‚Äôt just swing your bat randomly against Anna hoping it will connect for a six/boundary.,7
A wild rayudu walks out üíÄüíÄ,1
"yup most impactful player ever. 



for the opposition.",3
Why are they streaming RR catching practice session?,3

"This MF is getting paid more that Theeksana + Deshpande + Akash + Pathirana combined gets subbed out doesn't field has one job and sucks at it 


Waah money well spent.....",2
What is Sunil Gavaskar talking about? Faf does the impact thing and look at him,3
Wanna see Tuk Tuk Toni pace this runchase.,-4
No impact today,1

You ain't mess with anna,1
Impactful,4
"Hook, line, and sinker",2
ethical collapse,1
Goodbye CSK's NRR,0
Golden impact,1
This is an absolutely unbelievable Ashwin over. CSK I feel you. This guy won you matches. Now is doing exactly opposite for you,3
Now I feel dumb for expecting anything from Rayudu,4
WTF is happening bruh! Why our batting is crumbling like this against spin ![img](emote|t5_2qhe0|8774),2
"**10.4** nails the slog sweep straight to Holder at deep midwicket. Holder for a second appeared to have run across a bit too far, but recovered nicely to keep his balance and take the catch. Rayudu didn't field all evening, comes in as an Impact Sub and lasts all of two balls. Ashwin is pumped, Royals are all over CSK.

Ambati Rayudu c Holder b Ashwin 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0",1
How are they even selecting an impact player?,1
RR has three world class White ball spinners.How can other Nine teams let that happen,3
2022 csk returned,2
Impact of impact players this season should make them rethink the rule üòÇ,2
Ash  doing it all again against CSK,2
Sanju > Thala in captaincy?,1
Why is Akash Singh always gloomy?,1
Sunny G: Rayadu gone for a 2 ball duck (???),2
Brain dead shot selection,3
Raydu always looks like he was interrupted from taking a shit,6
Chennai Geriatric Kings are back,0
Rr playing 4d chess uno reverse by pulling a spin choke on csk,2
Put a big score on board and choke the opposition with spin. RR doing a CSK to CSK.,2
Good guy Rayudu. Didn't waste any balls.,4
Rayudu needs to prove his worth. Thala has given him enough chances. Only he has it in him to pull us out of this shit.,6
Ipl teams ü§ù choke against spin,4
Haha told you,2
Oh fuck no collapse baigan. I want the game to go till last over,2
Did he really thought that he can clear that long long boundary with a flimsy sweep,5
"üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ thala plz save the match,i'll break 100 thengas for you",9
Holy fuck Ashwin,2
Rayudu match by match turning into a liability,4
Thala 61(28),2
RR spin choking CSK for the 2nd game in this season.,3
Wc year 3D performance was required especially when Shankar has been doing well,3
"If csk wants a chance at the title, they better hope they don't face RR in the playoffs",11
Sunny g not liking anything the new generation does,4
Just wanted to confirm if this is CSK playing today. Looks like RCB to me,3
Imagine if Dhoni also goes for single digits LMAO,1
Release rayudu ffs. He‚Äôs finished,5
bruh,1
"It was DK in last World Cup, it will be Rahane in WTC! IPL shaping Indian cricket. foreigners learning to bat and bowl in these conditions is just cherry on top!",6
Just hate losing wickets to Ashwin. Any other bowler is fine,3
Hope csk gets thrashed hard,-3
Only RR has pulled Dhoni before the 15th over.,6
"the good side of the match is, we will see thala for more than 2 balls this time",9
Safe to say that we ain't winning this.,4
Both team fans would want Thala to come in for different reasons,13
"CSK V RR 

Rayudu comes on as a sub gets out for 1(2) 

2 weeks later 

Rayudu comes on as a sub and plays the same shot and gets out for 0(1)",9
Don't want to jinx this but absolute dominance from RR so far.,5
"Rahane after getting selected for wtc


my work here is doneü¶∏",10
Rajasthan fans do u even feel the joy of winning by defeating thala?,3
Sunny g stfu if he didn't go for it from ball 1 you would have said has to show intent with RR being high. Absolute hypocrites the commentators.,6

RR always gives CSK the taste of their own medicine #Spinchoke,4
Rayudu the mostest uselessest player of the season.,5
Two awesome teams going at it.,1
"Don't worry, Dube will save CSK",0
Wtf is this CSK lineup? Moeen comes in at 4 down.. next is Jadeja.. and Dhoni after him.. Batdeep..,3
"If CSK's spinners choked us. 
It was evident we would kill the game with Zampa on board. 
CSK didn't target our pacers when they could have",1
I completely forgot we had Moeen lol,3
Save Chahal and Zampa overs for the death so Dhoni can't hide so easily,4
Csk gonna lose by 70 runs atleast,1
Thala needs to prove his worth. Rayudu has given him enough chances. Only he has it in him to pull us out of this shit.,3
Moeen needs to perform this match,1
What a fucking over,2
I thought only RCB chokes against spin,1
MSD and Jaddu are going to win this for CSK ^^^^/s,1
1 run and 2 wickets in that over.,2
Genuine question - when was the last time RR won at Jaipur? Was it a decade back?,1
I saw Logic in the crowd,2
Annna angry against csk for letting him go,1
Simping,2
"Let's be honest. This isn't a batting failure, it's a bowling failure by CSK. They never should've conceded 200+ on this ground. There's way too much scoreboard pressure now.",7
Unpopular opinion : KLoL >>> Jinx in wtc final,3
"Dhoni be like......
Ajj to dhoti khul jaye gi",6
Oof,1
Anna bhayia we didn't steal your daughter's candy ffs why you do this to us,4
Always fun to see CSK in a pickle.,2
How good is Ashwin? Gets tonked in the first couple and comes back like a king,5
RR pulling a CSK spin choke on CSK,6
At least statpad your way to 180,6
Rayudu looks like he was asked to bat in middle of shitting,6
save the nrr now thats the only thing we can do,2
How did we top the table lmao.. should make top 4 somehow,4
"This reminds me of 2020 CSK

Good times",7
Only Thala 91* can save csk now,3
Yaar RR always gets better of us,3
"Mo, Sir, and Dhoni in shambles",1
Spin choke in full effect.,1
"hahah RR enjoy the win here lol, Title is Dhoni's",-1
Thala gonna face his demons and score a 100(45) against Yuzi and Zampa (3 off the first 15 then 97 off the next 30),6
"OMG they're going to belligerently humiliate us tonight, aren't they?",7
"Lmao, Thala seems to have 0 confidence on himself. Should have atleast led from front",4
Raydu was retained at 6 cr üò≠üò≠üò≠,5
lol not holder now,3
All set for dhoni masterclass,1
Can holder bowl ONE good over. 1!,2
"Rahane should have stuck around and waited for pace, and left the spin counterattack to dube",3
"Thala will be the difference between a 80 run loss and a 40 run loss.

An 80 run loss will be so nice.",3
"Sanju is Rohit Sharma Lite.

Potential, Career Progression, Captaincy",7
Sanju holding back chahal for whom? Dhoni?,2
"Highest ever ipl score at Chepauk is 246 vs RR in 2010

Rr finally have their revenge by scoring the highest ever score at Jaipur against csk",8
"make or break knock for Ali IMO

Santner and Stokes both eyeing his position",2
What. I thought Dube was already gone by now,1
Damn RR might just have 10 Indian supporters but they have atleast 20 foreigners supporting them,3
No disrespect but please get Kumble and Parthiv out of the insiders panel.,1
Laddoo bowler Holder.,2
"rahane ran out of selection serum, he's back to original form",7
Bruh someone tell CSK the target is 200 not 120,5
csk reverse spin choke happening today,3
Who changed the ground?,2
I don't even want to say anything. Mofos playing with rr of 6 on a pitch where even someone like paddikal scored at a good sr,2
Spin choke uno reverse on csk... Loving it,3
"This match is again already done, so boring. Just like in Chennai it's the spin that has won it for RR, absolutely horrible batting from CSK against spin. There's a huge difference in class between the two sides, CSK didn't use Moeen's bowling well and Moeen didn't bowl very well in the overs he bowled either.",1
"Jaddu and Dhoni to come .. if Dube takes down 1 spinner to task ,, still CSK can give RR a scare but Mo has to play a blinder",2
Bahane got exposed on the first wicket which is not an absolute road.,-1
Just slipping in a holder over like we wouldn't notice,3
"This match has been so bad for CSK, Dube prolly wont even get his usual 1 lakh for the longest six.",5
Can the IPL reserve a certain number of seats for the home fans? CSK fans hijacking every stadium is freaking annoying.,-1
Rajasthan is too good this year  they have a lot of batting power even tho sometimes they choke but so does every team,2
"Dube against pace is me against my project guide...no answers to the questions, unmoved no matter what.",2
I think CSK bowled a bit too fast on this pitch,1
"Required runrate is 14. Just need a six, a four and 4 singles every over. Not that difficult.",2
"Instead of Holder ,pure bowler should be played, he is not contributing with bat",1
"If anyone wants to make some of the easiest money in their life, bet on CSK to win this from here. Thank me later.",3
This is the 3rd continous match ash has fucked csk over.,1
Rayudu shouldn't have deleted his tweet,1
Waiting for THALA to guide youngsters how to play at the WTC ü•∞,1
"How has Dhoni faired against spin recently? Genuine question, watching IPL after quite some time...",1
Raydu is just there for some reason even after announcing his retirement. Don't they have anyone better then him?,3
Ashwin on course to win his third straight MOTM vs CSK üíÄ,2
Csk fucked it up... Top tier bowling by RR,1
"RR is a team that relies heavily on data and numbers while CSK runs on vibes and friendships. At the end of the day, friendship can only get you so far but it's always the numbers that trump.",-1
[deleted],5
I think its a steep steep road ahead for CSK.. Only if the helicopter hovers over the ground.. There are chances..,3
"Ah the csk fans were trying to tell RCB how to chase yesterday. Guess they need some advice today, huh?",4
Thala needs to whip out his calculator. I have a spare too.,5
"Bro running singles ain't gonna help,this ain't test cricket yo",3
Now we suddenly don't want Saudi beyond the boundary smh,3
Jinx learnt that he is in the international team and he lost all his form just like DK,2
Dube bro you have nothing to lose...just smack some big ones for fun and make this match worth watching,1
"Batting so shit, Holder seems to be hard to hit",3
Not calling the game out. We chased gt from same position,5
"Weak bowlers and Jaddu,Ali,Rayudu not contributing enough with bat,washed up eyeless MSD and hot n cold Rutu. I don't know how CSK is not at the bottom.",-9
When was the last boundary,1
Jason is just here to give CSK a chance,6
Beautiful beardy,4
That was very much Yuvraj like stroke,3
So as soon as rahane has been recalled into the indian squad this happens. Interesting,5
Class shot,2
Wait we're allowed to hit sixes?,2
We need a Pubkiss like last 6-7 overs now,2
Jurel‚Äôs innings had a similar impact like the one played by Jitesh Sharma for PBKS vs RCB,2
Moeen Ali is such an under-ated player.,2
I am a thalason but not a csk supporter so i just waiting for two more quick wickets,3
Bloody bazball,6
What a shot,2
No point in bowling Holder here,5
"Spin choke: Is working

Sanju and RR management: Holder time",5
"Wait a min, didn't this ali guy score almost a ton last year against us.",10
A batsman who can‚Äôt move his feet at all cannot do jack shit in front of a decent let alone good bowling attack.,5
"This match is over already, clearly CSK can't play Ashwin well. They might actually by some miracle make it closer than what we see now like it happened in Chennai. But in reality the match is well beyond CSK now. Needing 120 off 51 is impossible.",3
Holder has been useless this year.. They should have played Root instead of Holder.. his spin would have been useful here too..,8
"Ex RCB bois Ali and Dube, delivering for CSK.",1
Cockroach hallucinations,1
"""Holder?

I don't even know her!""

- Moeen",5
Nicely jinxed csk,2
Need to try Shaik Rasheed,3
One sided match.. sigh,3
Just get the rrr under 12 anything can be done in the last 3 4 overa,3
Csk with chuck master pathirana should be in the bottom half of the table.,-18
"rayudu this season: doesnt bat,doesnt field

living the good life",8
Why bowl Holder now when you can choke with spin?,6
Dhoni in his mind:- Gotta save the NRR....,6
I Jst started watching the match and what is happening,3
Rahane failure after squad announcement üò≠üò≠,6
"really like rr though, they have a very wholesome team. honestly if csk don't make it to finals i'd be rooting for rr to win",9
I'm on full copium boys...,2
If these two can put together a decent partnership  MS and Jadman can finish the game. Tho the game is firmly in RR's hand.,1
Why RR isn't going to kill this game by tightening the grip through spinners?,1
oh no boring LSG match tomorrow,2
stokes here for vibes lol,3
"Moeen Ali is one of the most eye pleasing batsmen I have seen and Dube, the complete opposite.",5
Sickening this batting üïØÔ∏è,1
How dube is good against spin is beyond me. The guy has no footwork lmao,1
"If CSK wins from here, they deserve the trophy this season",5
Ppl complaining about csk bowling failure: with that bowling line up it‚Äôs bound to happen more often than not. CSK is batting heavy and light on bowling. So batting has to over compensate,3
"Don't worry CSK fans, this is not a disasterclass but rather a masterclass because CSK want us to witness the Power of Thala üòé",6
18 Balls 17 runs chasing 200,1
Cant play spin at all üòï,1
Why is Ben stokes not playing for Chennai? Such a match winner warming benches,6
"Stokes with a bowl cut lol

(At least looked like one from that angle)",1
20 balls too late CSK,3
The real difference has been how RR and CSK have played spin and worse yet they wasted so many deliveries in the powerplay.,7
5 sixes from dube would really help here,8
Ffs,2
I bet my left nut that csk with the average bowling attack they have won't be in the finals.,2
The slow start fucked us up,2
RR's win but pls close the nrr gap,3
Wide? Need all the runs here.,3
Not Chahal being annoyed at sloppy fielding üò≠,8
the fuck are these guys doing? did they give up??,5
Bruh RCB were so scared of this guy they only bowled 2 overs of Hasaranga but Vyshack 4-0-62-0,2
Atleast get to 120 in 15 overs lmao. What you will score 100 off 5 now?,1
Dube isn‚Äôt hitting his sixes wtf. Then get out,1
Two new lefties and Ashwin is taken out?,2
Who to root for in the Choker‚Äôs Classico?,-5
"Two Ex RCB batters facing Ex RCB bowler Yuzi.

RCB, RCB! ESCN!!",2
Rahane ü§ù DK,7
150 for csk max from here,1
The umpire who gave this not a wide is the same moron who gave a Yorker wide when batter shuffled towards off. The way wides are called so arbitrarily is baffling really.,10
"Just hand them the trophy if CSK heist it from this situation, and patent the name El ~~profesor~~ Thala",12
Yet another csk match where everyone gets bullied into going out so that Dhoni can bat,2
Keep smacking,2
We are in thala mode,3
Stokes got that Rs 20 hair cut at the side of the road.,7
Need mo of that,5
Shreyas bowls better,3
"Hindi Comm

Q to Imran Tahir - What was discussed in the dressing room after Dhoni walked to the ground angrily after the no ball incident

moeen do be cunting us today,6

Ash anna running n slomo lol,1
Some hope,2
Quick outfield.,1
Moen beaut,2
Moeen has a point to prove here because his position in the team is in jeopardy when Stokes is fit.,1
13 and still not enough.,1
Yuzi Chahal is SO TRASH,2
Why don‚Äôt they give up and send thala so at least we can see him play,1
We're 1 over behind based on the double your 12 over score rule,2
Yeah this isn't over,2
Let's aim for 170 at least.,2
In few moments this thread will either apologise to dube or curse him even more,3
"If this Dube Mofo scores 30+, I will stop watching this IPL",7
Next two overs gonna be crucial if CSK can score 25-30 within next two then they are in the game for sure,2
Sandeep Sharma vs Dhoni 2.0 ?,4
100 runs in 7 overs?,5
long strong hands dube has arrived,8
Dube pls,4
Well fuck,6
Why a CSK match thread so slow today?,1

I think moeen is going to take us,1

I have a slight feeling we will choke this,4
ash na is jogging to the boundary,1
Dube let's go,2
Stop talking shit about Dube lol,5
Chaube please that's enough,2
99 from 41 looks doable,3

Was she screaming in his ears?,3
Less go dhubhe,2
"The fact that RR bowlers have controlled this innings so well despite some ordinary fielding shows how much of a gap in quality there is between the bowling of both these sides. Except for Pathirana, literally no one else in CSK was really unlucky.",3

Finally CSK wake up from slumber,5

That was very good shot picked from length good going Dube,2
i also want someone to whisper in my ears like that,6
I swear the camera man has never seen a women in his life,12
Ashwin was bowling good from other end..? Why would you tinker with something that works..?,4
I love watching Ashwin bowl in Test cricket but in limited over format I want him to get cunted so badly,4
how the fuck do CSK get more cheers in RR's home ground!,8
Csk chasing exactly opposite how RCB does..,4
Someone please tell Raina to fucking chill!,8
Break this fucking partnership before they reach near the doable zone!,4
Dubemania,2
Dube was pretty trash for india and RCB. What happened,6
Within next over Moeen be gone ! Come back to this comment.,-6
"as a CSK fan, it still pains me to see Ashwin hit. could we not have done this to some other bowler",4
Lady was whispering in that guy's ear Ashwin about to Mankad,13
What happensd in 2019 between csk n rr in jaipur???,5
Bruh why delaying so much,2
"Too Little too late against this bowling attack, CSK have left a lot to do. Ash, Chahal are top bowlers they know how to come back when they get hit.",8
Ashwin seems like Outta options,3
"CSK match routine 

Dube: plays few dot balls 
r/cricket: no feet movement, he is trash 

Dube: hits two sixes

r/cricket: prime Yuvi",69

"Lol , 59% people thing CSK spin attack is better than RR",31
"RCB and DC are the only teams that cannot win from 110-4 chasing 200.    
LSG has a better chance chasing 200 at 110-4 than 110-1 üòõ",4
"Excellent come back from Ash, that's been the difference between the two sides.",2
Anna strong comeback...,3
"With Dube in crease one thing for sure,, no one is getting quick 2s and 1s",3
"Why wouldn‚Äôt players like Dube, Kishan go all out to fix their strike rotation, running ‚Äî this is what will give them an edge in their careers",10
how tf is Ashwin bowling at 102kph??,3
90 in 6 to tie,3
That 59% in cak's favor is cuz Thala 50% behind the stumps and 9% for the chennai spinners,9
CSK need the Dube that smashed them the day Rutu scored his maiden IPL 100.,3
whose win is beneficial for rcb?,3
"now bring Zampa ,, i want to see if Dube can smash him",7
I want Anna's hat.,1
Req. run rate went up even after scoring 15 runs üíÄ,7
Just Hit 15 sixes. What's the big deal.these guys are playing like they never played cricket Before.,9
"90 from 6 overs, and for some reason I am still a bit worried as RR fan.",12
Why Anna why,2
Whoever came up with the knowledge Chennai crowd moniker needs to drop the term after that 59-41 poll in favour of CSK spinners ü§¶,4
Polls are mostly a fan battle.,9
"If dube knows/can learn how to sweep/reverse sweep, he will go for 20 cr in the next auction. Ash anna left the whole point, covers, third man region open and bowled wide. If dube could've hit for a six there, imagine the scenes.",3
"Dube is one of the most handsome lads in cricket today. Great height, great physique and a super model face.",4
"Im happy if CSK get at least 170. A loss is okay.

All batsmen have peaked too early. A few games to get back in form.",2
Should RR bowl out 4 overs of leg spin against lefty batsmen?,1
What's going on,2
2 big overs is all we need,2
The only surprising thing about that poll was that all 5 of RR supporters voted,6
3 overs 40 runs ....15 runs per over for 6 overs? Can Chennai take it to a winning position let alone win it? Will be it something like last time? 50 runs in 3 odd overs.....,3
Come on dube smash zampa,3
What‚Äôs up with umps and Sanju today,6
Man I'm scared for our over rate,6
"CSK need one Arjun Tendulkar or Yash Dayal kind of an over to get back, not happening with the bowlers RR have.",4
Csk: have the left it too late .. these big overs should have come earlier,3
What is happening between Sanju and Umpire?,6
"Wtf is going between Snaju and Umpires,
V",9
Wats up with sanju today.. why he is arguing with umpires,7
Dube should be sponsored by a cement company for his footwork.,11
Guys u can do it,4
Dube needs to perform miracles here,8
FFS this was game on if we weren't 15 runs short in PP.,9
Does Dube use lube?,4
Woahh,1
Rcb bois with the calculators out already? üíÄ,5
"I feel like Dube is not really international quality, but at the same time, he might be worth another look if he keeps up these 30-50 scores regularly",5
seeing ashwin smashed is so statisfying,4
Dube ffs why you couldn't do this stuff for us,8
The sword of justice by Dube,5
Dube tonks zampa,3
Launched but too late,2
Oh fuckoff,4
Dube spin killer.....,2
Protein boy has arrived!,2
Dube daddy,1
Bowl wide please. Bowl wideeeee,2

Zampa to bowl his third(turd).,1
"What would you rather have when you‚Äôre chasing 200? 
A 0 (2) from Rayudu or a 50(38) from KL?",5
"Wtf with poll, too much CSK fans in survey. RR spin > CSK spin.",8
Well.. fuck..!!,3
That dube mf didn't do shit for India,9
How come this much CSK fans?,3
That's what I want to see dube üóø,5
We'll probably not win but atleast we are showing Intent‚Ñ¢,5
Bro match won or lost but dubey played so many good innings in this ipl happy for him,4
"He is got so much power he doesn‚Äôt have to time it properly.

Appreciate and shitpost at the same time",6
Dube and moeen please save us,4
NRR boost.,0
[deleted],2
Why can't foreigners pronounce the ‡§¶ properly?,1
"This ain't Kohli, Zamps.",4
If dubey Learnt some footwork he will be invincible against Spin. Those big levers need some help to access more ground.,15
CSK need to make this into a 20 run over,4
Dune is having a good run this time,3
Two banned teams playing verses each other,9
My faithful apology to Dube I know shit about him,9
These are some of the best spinners in the world.,7
Haha fuckin up momentum,3
At what RRR will we stop playing and declare?,5
RR get a fucking move on you guys are so ahead in this game.,2
these two are the ultimate cunters of spin,3
Lol imagine how good Dube would be if he could move his feet. Such a shame,6
Dube gonna chase it down with 2 overs remaining if they continue like this,1
Why are they taking so much time,5
fucking bowl u idiots,4
"Dube is striking bcci door if he scores 50 today , csk changed his whole image , I forgot about the dube in rcb who choked every single time. Rcb is clown can train others to be clown only not better cricketers.",4
shivam dube is what ben stokes tries to be,6
RR talking so much time ffs,3
Sanju tactically delaying to upset momentum,4
"Drinks break in Jaipur hardly takes 30 seconds coz there is no water anyways...

/s",24
I think RR are going be behind the over rate,3
im more interested in what‚Äôs up with umps and Sanju today,8
"Honestly it's unbelievable how slow CSK were to go for it with their batting, their first 10 overs lost them this match. Too much to do now.",8
"Dube hits a 6 

Sanju Samson: team meeting gather",18
"Announcer: We want wicket

The crowd: SIXERüëπüëπüëπ",13
if conway had got even a run a ball we would've had a chance,9
These fuckers again delaying to break momentum. Don't they talk before bowling the over or what ? Smh.,15
Certified Bhuvan finding Kachra‚Äôs talent moment with Dhoni and Dube.,7
I'm more worried about the NRR,6
Sanju is going to Tank RR's fairplay point today,21
"Fucking bowl you lazy mfs

Running behind ethics they forgot that game has to be played also",8
Samson going for a draw here,3
"Dube :

six bhi maarta hoon

four bhi maarta hoon

kahi bhagwan na ban jaau

isliye footwork nahi dikhata hoon

T : blitzkreig hitting by Dube",6
"2 overs of Sandy in death overs ‚ò†Ô∏è

Csk is done in this game",6
Go guys,2
CSK with all those 6s are barely close to the RRR.,2
Loving it,2
A six and a 4 per over won't even dent the rrr at this point.,4
we winning this hahahahahhah,-1
Mo bhai is not consistent but he's got such a beautiful batting technique,5
Pure time waste from rr,6
Dube's feet no longer stuck in cement. Srini mama must have supplied adulterated cement for Dube to stand in.,9
"**14.5**

Moeen Ali c ‚Ä†Samson b Zampa 23 (12b 2x4 2x6) SR: 191.66",1
Don't win CSK nobody wants that,-2
How TF the ball went straight down the ground,2
Lmao bye bye,2
"I thought KKR spinners were utter garbage when RR got those 4 but Mo and Dube give me some hope.


Yes we're still a shit line up, just a little less shit than I thought",4
Jadeja will finish it,5
Excellent catch and wicket,4
"If I have GT middle order then rayudu, if I have rcb middle order then KL",5
Yooo Thala time now,1
Match winning spell by Adam here,5
3 wickets for zomps,2
Yea bois we back,6
My boy Jadeja please save us,8
ZAMMMMPPPPPPAAAAAA,4
Oh  friggin hell üò≠üò≠,3
"Let's go baby. Zampa sa, padhaaro mhaare desh!

T: zampa welcome to the home",6
Yeah they don't need stokes at all,4
Great take by Sanju,6
Zampa is a specialist CSK merchant.,11
Get ready for WTC /s,2
SHIT FUCK SHIT FUCK,4
"What a catch, and the quality of RR's bowling comes to the fore again.",8
Fuking zampa only plays to fuk us,18
Bole Jo koyal,6
Dhoni will still be too scared to come out,0
There goes hope.,2
gg csk,2
The target is too big,2
"Good catch, hope they show the replay at least a couple of times as compared to 100 times for Dhoni",10
Did Zampa just do Chahal's celebration lol,7
Well Sanju‚Äôs tactics worked,4
Long Live Zampa!,3
"Zampa's good figures being spoilt here....
Oh 3rd wicket.....man is a damn good ODI T20 spinner....not letting Chennai get momentum with continuous wickets....",5
Just one more wicket for two over hack to grace us with his presence.,0
Ffs,1
Jadeja ain't hitting leg spin,2
What a bowler and what a keeper!!,5
Why not send Dhoni in for LH RH combo?,2
Jadeja please use your spell,2
Cannot watch live due to work. So is it yellow or pink,1
RR is proper scum for doing these delaying tactics.,6
Sanju is pretty good keeping for spinners. Was he always at this level?,8
We will see thala bat today,4
Guys chill dube is still there üóø,5
Jadeja in. He's usually frustrating to watch at this stage. Hope he delivers this time.,7
get to 180 the nrr loss wont be too bad?,3
"If Thala hits today, he should simply return to ICT from retirement",4
Jadeja please hit from first ball,3
"Big brain take from Ravi: ""This is could be a match winning spell from Zampa if RR end up winning"".",12
Thala where?,2
What is this batting line up,2
HOPE WE SEE THAL BAT 3-4 OVERS,0
"Can't believe samson was benching zampa, he provides way more value than holder especially on spinning tracks",6
Dhoni to hit winning runs?,5
Just tuning in. Why did Conway eat up so many balls? Good bowling in the powerplay?,4
Anyone else feel Dhoni is a specialist captain coz he comes into bat so late he doesn't even get an opportunity.,8
[deleted],12
Please send Dhoni,2
End with a six Jaddu,3
"Bruh this is karma, spin choke to the OG spin chokers",9
jaddu six catch incoming,2
[deleted],2
"Csk when I'm not watching their innings : *tonks*

Csk when I'm watching their innings :",8
"At this rate, RR will only be allowed to have 4 fielders outside the circle in the last over.

I mean, CSK still going to lose, but still.",4
Jaddu and Dube partnership coming,2
There goes the gameüïú,2
For playing so long Jaddu needs to learn to finish games.. he usually chokes at these stages,5
Jadeja looking fresh as hell ü•µü•µü•µ,9
Jaddu please no 9(9) today,10
I hate say this but jaddu might ruin the momentum,4
",.CSK starts shiting bed suddenly folks with other team flairs start raiding match thread......",18
Sandeep sharma vs Dhoni rematch loading...!!!!! üçæüçæ,8
"If pathirana bowled that, edge would have gone for 6",13
How many overs of spinners left?,1
"Jadeja is handicapped against spinners, ain't no way we are winning this",4
Yup everyone else is out of form RR ez win,2
This Yippee ad is the worst I have seen so far. I will not buy yippee purely out of spite.,3
The DJ is trying his hardest to get the crowd to cheer for rajasthan but they just cheer for csk. He was trying a we want wicket cheer and it turned into we want sixer.,8
"The last three overs have produced 13, 15 and 12 which is good but CSK's RRR is close to 16 now.",7
Jaddu came to bat mid shave,4
"These momentum breaking intentional delays are so frustrating to watch.

ICC and BCCI really needs to do something to bring this under control.",12
When did CSK innings start? Can we get the ONLY 4 outside the circle penalty?,6
"Don't worry CSK fans, I wasn't watching the match till now. Now, that I've started watching at the end of the 15th over, CSK will script an incredible comeback to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat",14
Hate that overseas spinners are under-utilised in IPL. Quality bowlers like Zampa and Adil will always find a way to come back even if they get hit,4
"78 runs in 30

If it's Chinnaswamy it's doable

If it's CSK it's doable",11
thala knows,6
"I know it's 'within the rules' to break the momentum by pretending to discuss and change field, but I hope it comes to bite them in the ass some time, if not this match.",16
I don't care about CSK. I just want someone to get out so that Thala can come.,5
"RR has been quite consistent in every match, even the 3 matches they have lost are by 5, 7 and 10 runs, very small margins. 

Lot to celebrate for our grand total of fan base of 8 fans.",12
"Bharatiya Jadeja Party isn't going to score at the required rate, should have sent Dhoni imo",12
"As if the deadslow match is not irritating enough, they are playing the irritating rapido ad everytime. Just stop it",8
"Playing Sandeep in powerplay for 8 runs off 2 overs is criminal. Especially the 2nd over where Conway batter was pretty bad, there was no swing just stump to stump bowling and he did nothing.",8
"vintage dhoni alone would redeem this disastrous week for me.

Come on man",10
Anyone has video of dhoni in 2019 vs rr.,9
What has jadeja done to his face???,3
u/keenlyproper_demeanr It's [over](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/130lkbq/match_thread_37th_match_rajasthan_royals_vs/jhxw8qt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) mate. Hope you enjoyed the IPL,3
Jadeja shitting as usual,4
Sunnyji > Modiji,-2
RR and GT are CSK's real kryptonite recently. CSK always losing to these teams.,5
Jaddu before dhoni :  What about left right combination which commentators love to talk about /s,3
What should you tell to barber if you want zampa's haircut?,3
Samson is excellent with the bowling rotations,10
Good thing Jadeja tried to swing,1
Sandy Sharma nailing yorkers again..,7
"Should go studying ig , ain't nothing going to happen now.",6
Every Jaddu needs a Harshal Patel for him to get going,8
"Some outstanding bowling from RR here, if RR gets to bat first more they're a force to reckon with in this IPL.",3
Someone said that they will stop watching IPL if dube scores 30. where are you? I expect you to stop watching this instant.,11
Terrefic bowler,3
I feel bad for jaddu everybody are  celebrating  his wicket,11
"Samson's pretty good as a keeper, for someone who's secondary skill it is.",5
show the balls to runs already idiots still showing RR and Target thing,4
Jadeja as a t20 batsman is over rated as fuck. Sue me.,24
Somebody remind Sandeep of Watson and tonk him,8
BRO ONLY DEALING IN YORKERS,10

Best death bowler dot,5
Dude is nailing those yorkers.,6
It's 3:16am here... I should maybe go to sleep I have to wake up for uni,8
i have full faith in jadeja to play a 8(8) kind of innings,7

Need prime dhoni to win today,10
CLOSE THE GAP AT LEAST YOU IDIOTS,4
"Aarshdeep vs Sandeep 
who balls better yorkers?",1
RR team solving Israel palestine conflict in between drinks breaks,15
A little late here but why do they play Rayadu? He‚Äôs clearly past contributing to the team,10
How frauds like Harshal make it into the ICT while players like Sandy don‚Äôt is beyond me.,27
This Sandeep is nailing his Yorkers damn never imagined him to be this clutch,21
I hope Thala smacks Sandeep he has been so incredibly good...,-2
"Sandy really √πtilised the opportunity given to him by RR and has been exceptional, even at the death, which he was known to be pretty bad at....",19
Good to bring Sandy nd increase the rrr,21
If Sandeep were a foreigner then teams would break the bank for him,72
Only vintage thala can save us,15
RR massacred CSK lineup,16
Chaddeep,9
What an over!,5
"This is also some poor batting, Watson would tonk the living shit out of Sandeep. Dude is barely bowling at 130 and CSK's batters can't even move around in the crease to get him off his length.",11
"At this point, they are not even trying loo",3
Just watch Ceat strategic timeout fuck the momentum of another batting team again.,6
Discover the wonders of women having no rights,31
We have really made Sandy a prime Mcgrath.,10
Jaddu and Hardik don't give me confidence anymore especially if they have to hit from ball 1. Somehow Hardik  has turned himself into an anchor.,17
Dhoni needs to pull a Jurel‚Ä¶or rather a Dhoni classic,11
4 fucking singles of the over when Run Rate is almost 16. Woahh Sandyy,15
Chahal casually checking dube‚Äôs bat,13
I will guffaw if Dhoni doesn't get to bat here,6
Start sports got no ads lol,5
[removed],8
"Csk needed 60 in last 4 overs vs RR last time

Now 75

No hopes

Zzzzzzz",15
dhoni vs spin.....I dont know how that'll go,2
this is great bowling,6
"A colleague once said that i look like Shivam Dube, and i was very flattered",11
Fuckers should be ashamed for the amount of delay,14
"4 overs get 50 runs more. 

Will definitely help in later stages of the tournament.",6
my god sunnyG is annoying,4
74 off 4 comfortably losing by 30 runs,7
Looks like the players take a time out on their own and the umpire is left there clueless.,3
Too many ads and breaks man.,6
Can we get rid of the Timeout? When was it introduced for the first time?,9
74 from 4 is just too much for anyone.,14
We at least shouldn‚Äôt lose the nrr gain we have gained over the past games,10
Please try Senapathi or Sheikh in place of Raydu man ain't fielding just gettin subbed in and contribution is net zero....,11
Insiders dgaf about stragetic time out or visitsaudi.,10
Umpires forgot about CEAT^(TM) Strategic Timeout¬Æ.,10
they waited for normal over ads to end to announce timeout.,7
Jaddu only bats well when msd is at the other end,7
Sandeep Sharma is the most underrated ipl player ever. Can't believe he went unsold in the auction.,11
Chahal checking dube's bat,8
"Imagine if we could hire an Imapct player from any team we want, 

CSK could have Rinku now",5
Yuzi being most goofy ahh player,7
CSK losing this match only to somehow clutch a win in the final against RR again.,11
"Great. With the kind of drink breaks they were taking, there shouldn't have even been a strategic time out",3
JADDU BETTER MAKE SOMEONE HARSHAL TONIGHT.,10
There is an actual timeout? I though Samson took one every time a six is hit üòÇ,9
Better make the win prediction to 0%,2
"CSK fans , how u feeling now, can we win this?",1
we want t20i version of thalla 98t20i zero motm,2
No way rr losing it,2
[deleted],3
Sandy is on another level this season honestly.,5
Can RR bottle this like Arsenal?,6
"Need to pull a ""Russell against RCB at chinnaswamy in 2019"" level heist to win this",7
need dube to turn into rinku all of a sudden,8
[removed],4
Where was this Sandeep when he was playing for SRH?,0
"A colleague once said that i look like Yuzvendra Chahal, and i was very flattered",1
That one over in death from Sandeep Sharma has destroyed every last tiny bit of hopes of CSK,4
[removed],2
"Someone ought to tell Dube is a 40 of 20 kinda player... Not 30 of 20. He is specifically there to tonk it irrespective of the condition. Play stupid if need be, but fkn do it.",1
"Sandeep sharma is becoming a beast against CSK, CSK are missing his type of bowling in this wicket( chahar frauding CSK since 2022)",2
wont sanju get a ban since over rate is so slow? or is it the third match that gets you ban?,7
Difficult. Reckon they lose by 15-20 runs,8
Bring ms or declare,5
MI should have gone for Sandeep Sharma instead of Warrier as bumz replacement. MI recruitment has gone to trash last few seasons. They were the best at it once.,1
"RR Bros know they are winning already, now working in advance by reverse jinxing for finals and playoffs. Lmao",8
My prediction about zampa fucking CSK was right,2
"Can I kill the guy who created the 'Bike wali taxi sabse saxi' ad

"Shivam I‚Äôll get your jersey if you win this for us man

Seriously first CSK jersey I ever get and I‚Äôll get his name on the back if he does it",8
"CSK you have 2 options. 
Either send MSD and have him go from ball 1. 
Or collapse give us the NRR.",10
"Dhoni can single handedly win this, according to some logic less fans",7
"Last time when Dhoni came in CSK needed 53 off 3, they fell short. CSK need at least one 25 run over here to stay in the game. If this doesn't go they can forget a win here.",8
Banggg,6
Cemented that,2
How high was it?? Higher than the teenagers in Punjab for sure!,6
Ceat tyre strategic time out gotta be the best thing about IPL matches,3
Holder is holding this bowling lineup back today,2
Why holder is playing,1
Stand and deliver,2
Bike wali taxi sabse saxi? Cringiest fucking slogan ever,6
Fuck this is what we needed,3
"Rather bowl Kuldip , Holder has been below average this whole season",2
Dube my men has so much strength,5
Dube not ready to let go off of his 1L of longest six,11
Holder boy is brought back when people need entertainment.....,5
All things are possible with Shivam Dube,3
"Holder Neesham Jordan

Most overrated bowlers in the world.",5
No script writing for the last 4 overs ??,2
"Cmon boys, give me my 170.",3
Ceat should award Swanny for ingraining them into our brains.,3
Holder will definitely compensate that beautiful previous over from Sharma,4
"Holder will again fuck us over. 
Helped Rutu get in groove. Now again he'll miss lengths",2
Theyre gonna cunt holder aren‚Äôt they,5
"who let out a ""ooooooooff"" in the commentary? üòπ literally my reaction as well",3
"This strategic time-out is longer than us boys taking water, pepsi breaks in gully cricket.",8
Why the fuck Holder is cricketer,1
Got the longest six award noe get out,2
Sandeep Sharma vs MS Dhoni Pt2... I will be there no matter what....,6
Anything wide is lava,8
1 20+ run over and this will be doable easily.,5
Surprised that it even crossed the boundary,-1
Bike wali taxi sabse saxi is the most fatherless thing ever,6
Should have bowled Chahal or Zampa this over.  Are they saving them for Thala? Dube statue,1
Dube ji keeping the match interesting,4
"fun to watch them hit something here and there, not like they gonna win anyway",1
Holder needs to bowl from around the wicket to Dube.,3
Why not bowl Zampa Chahal and Sandeep to finish,3
dube needs some training in judging wides,5
Rooooooooot for holder next match please,5
Dube masterclass,3
"Bowl a bouncer and Dube will leave it. Bowl it wide and Dube will leave it, that's easy work for RR bowlers who have some real quality.",4
Bro thinks he's playing RCB üò≠üò≠,7
Dube said his father gave him protein. Protein means chicken haha,6
What a shot!! Made the fielder run till the last moment!!,5
Dube beating hard,2
damn,1
Holder went for 20 odd runs a week or 2 ago against MSD and RJ... they will cash in now.,2
the outfield is crazy fast,2
Holder trying his best to make the match balanced but only if the sandy guy could do that same,4
Well placed!,3
Dive mf,6
I will never understand why would you bowl wide without backward point,6
Dive plz diveeee,3
Whatta squeezed boundary  ....,5
Lol KP,5
"does thala ever clap when his teammate hit a boundary?

i don‚Äôt ever see him do that",3
what a shot dube my boi,3
"why only 1 over spells of Zampa?

It makes 0 sense",1
Holder should be replaced by pure bowler,1
It's stupidity to let go a ball for wide when you need so many run.... 1 run ain't going to do shit,2
We can hit Holder only at this point. Pls Bois make the best use of this over,3
I recall Dube going Super Saiyan mode against csk two years ago when playing for rr chasing down 200,5
How many teams have managed to beat CSK both times in round robin stage? I guess it's an extremely short list.,8
Dube has become yuvraj now ??,4
"This match is getting too much one sided....

IPL scriptwriters: hold my chai.... Next over will be by holder",3
Dune is tired of everyone else trying and failing at it.,1
Poor fielding,2
"RR need points docked for this over rate

In the time between 16.1 and 16.3 gully cricket matches can be played completely",2
This is needlessly dragged into being another thriller,4
"What's up with thala 


Why can't he come before 20th over?",3
CSK still need like 15 in this over to stay in this game.,2
"Honestly if dube continues cunting spin throughout the season bcci should select him for one of them fucakall t20i series we have this year, if he does well there then we can slot him as specialist spin cunter since half our team is absolute mugs vs spin",9
No chance of winning till Jaddu plays,1
Why not go with zampa?,1
sandy vs thala 2.0 plz god plzüôè,5
Jaddu please tonk a couple,2
Dube single handedly keeping CSK in the hunt( I never thought I would say that),4
Dube has 55 fours and 57 sixix in ipl career my man knows to hit sixix,4
Man if we could have contained these guys to 185 we would have a really good shot. Sad.,6
"We want Dhoni,",1
Went for 4 but it was still a good ball,3
"11 run of the over, let's see what jadeja does. Guess what? nothing.",4
"Regardless of how good Dube plays in this shits N giggles tournament, I hope someone better gets the opportunity to play for India ahead of him.",5
Drop holder,2
"I was very worried after Krishna was ruled out for the season but Sandy has been incredible. Good problem to have next season. Could even release Boult, free up some of the purse",0
What's the price of that bowler üë¥üèª,6
"rcb should release lomror suyush next year , wait and see csk turn them into monsters",9
Dube only plays against his ex franchises ig..,4
C'mon jadeja you bits and pieces player smash it /s,11
I love and admire thala but he's a pussy for not coming in earlier and contribute a bit in chases like these,5
"Dube alone cannot do much, Jadeja isn't helping CSK here whatsoever.",11
Jaddu please imagine every bowler to be Harshal Patel,8
Not even Tim David can win it from here,5
The fielder did not put in the dive.,3
Wouldn't have believed in my wildest dream that there will be time when Dube would be only player in csk who would be trying to win it for them.,22
Happy for Dube mf with limited ability has punched above his weight...,6
Jadeja please practice shots on the offside lmao,10
Script of this game : Thala walks in to play the last ball of Sandeep 6 runs needed and he hits it out of the park,11
Jadduu what did u do to urself,5
"Holder and Pathirana look like long lost brothers. Adjusting for height, width, and color ‚Äî they have the same type of look",6
Jadeja isn't it. Might as well Dhoni come early.,10
pretty decent over from holder given his reputation,6
Why does Raina scream into the mic?,4
Better call Shivam,6
jaddu's batting has been horrible this season,6
Jadeja why are you doing this man( somebody tell him he is playing against kkr),3
Just saw the ending guys sorry for spoilers -  last short ball goes for a massive ~~wide~~ wife crossing the boundary. Last ball 7 runs and CSK wins it,4
"If Jadeja gets out quickly, CSK has a chance to win this.",5
Ffs Anna.,2
Jaddu ffs tonk from now,4
Only 16 runs off the over ... Lmao never thought I would say that.,7
Dune Vs Chahal would've good watch.....,2
Holder surely shouldn't be 4th foreign option when he has been shitting bricks and isn't even batting,4
Dube runs like he has massive tits,9
Zampa does not wanna dive i guess,3
Is 58 chasable in 3 ??? Asking for a friend?,7
These guys have so many spin overs left Jesus. Only Dube can win us this game.,3
Please never bowl Holder again,4
CSK needs a Shanaka against Australia,4
Jadeja should be coming in to bat earlier than that or he should be batting after Dhoni. He takes time to get settled.,4
poor field positioning from RR.,3
"Dube is finding gaps when bowled wide. Try na, Jaddu?",3
"Bro, CSK somehow turned Dube into an unstoppable beast.. Wtf Wow how?????",6
"Another excellent boundary of a pretty good ball.....
Dube in majestic touch....gotta be helped by Jaddu, can't do it alone....",1
"HoldER ‚ùå

HoldON ‚úÖ",3
Dube reminds me of Prime Dhoni,3
Req. Run rate still going up even after scoring 16 runs üíÄüíÄ,1
"everytime they bring in holder to bowl, csk gain some momentum",1
Only a good over from Sandeep could save rr,1
Those fucking lucky edges of Paddikal haunting us now.,3
Jaddu whack or retire out please it's ok.,3
Jaddu 4(5) when we need 20(5).,3
Thala wants to bat,1
Holder isn't being utilised the way he should be considering he can bat a bit,1
Dube is so good man,3
Csk needs an over with 20+ runs else it will be too much runs to score in 2 overs,4
Man.. it hangs on Sandeep's one over now.,2
Holder bowling himself out of RR lineup,2
lose by < 35 runs and i'll be happy,5
Too many wide yorkers,2
"Jadeja's batting form has been very worrying not just for CSK but for India as well. He hasn't been striking them well at all, he also barely goes through with his shots anymore, ends up getting caught in the boundary very often.",5
Full on yuvi vibes,3
Dube keeping CSK afloat,5
"That's interesting what's Samson going to try now? Going wide outside off isn't working, going full and straight isn't working.",1
"If shivam dube scores a century, CSK wins",4
Dube ji my GOAT üêê,5
Jaddu  show them your six hitting plz,1
"Three 20 run overs. Not that impossible

But just Dube though. Can't see it happening. Prime Dhoni might have.",5
No Harshal No party for Jaddu,2
"I love how an indian see a left hander bat pretty well and our first thought would be ""can he bowl""",3
Chad Sandeep with economy of 4,4
"For the love of God, keep both the third man and backward point back when you're bowling the wide line.",1
"When the required rate is 19, the dude is batting with the strike rate of 80",1
STILL CHASABAL BUT SANDEEP SAHRMA IS TOO GOOD,3
How powerful does Dubey strikes man ? It must be the milk that Dhoni drinks that Dubey also got hold of /s,5
 Jadeja always leaves it too late. He‚Äôs world class but feel like he overestimates his capabilities.,2
Dube has already done his part for this season.,8
Sandy with only 12 runs in 3 overs ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è,7
"CSK lost in Chennai when they needed 53 off 3, they need 58 now and there is no realistic chance for them from here imo.",4
Sandeep mf bowling crazy at death,3
Jadeja playing an ass innings,2
jaddu what happened to you,3
Holder making sure CSK‚Äôs nrr doesn‚Äôt take a beating,5
"Wtf. Sending Sandy now. So spin choke and Kuldip maybe at the end? 
Or Kuldip and Holder?",3
"Holder has been utter shite for us.

I think we can continue with Zamps at SMS & use Rootalidharan in other stadiums.",5
Sandeep not left for last over is sensible. Kill the game before it reaches last over,3
Jadeja poor üëé,3
"If CSK win this, I'll get the CSK Lion logo tattooed on my entire butt cheek.",10
Akash bhai Dhoni ka ground pr hone bhi jrori hai,1
Jaddu useless without Thala in a chase. Cannot hit to save his life.,4
Just 4 runs. WTF,2
No way Dube is cunting Sandy,2
this is still on...,1
Wish Jaddu was half as good as Dube. /s,4
Jadeja has been a massive fucking let down with the bat this year,11
Cont wait for the selector to consult dhoni about dube,3
Why is Chennai so uninterested today. From the very start actually.,3
Jaddu bhai this ain't it,4
BRO sandeep sharma deal only in yorker built diff,5
Jadeja bruh what you doing.,4
"Sure jaddu, we need some quick singles here",3
Sandeep is really awesome üíØ,3
Csk fans would be wishing for a wicket here than RR themselves.,9
Sandeep can close the game off in this over for RR,5
Someone needs to take Sandeep apart,2
Full and wide. Full and wide.,3
Dhoni getting a retirement tour all over India only to drop a solid 5th place finish in 2024,7
need all boundaries now,4
Sandy bowling yorkers again..,3
"Csk needed 54 that day 

58 today",3
Good solid bowling!!! Sandy is too good,2
Now RR will be forced to bowl Holder again. Should've given this to Kuldip and the 19th to Sandeep. Would've had the cushion of bowling kuldip for another over if he managed to bowl well,2
Did bumrah pass his soul to sandy before taking the break,8
"We want

DHONI",4
ok.. we fucked it up..? shouldn't it be  Kuldip-Sandeep-Kuldip ..? I guess we are going for Sandeep-Holder-Kuldip.,1
Jadeja is so bad in batting at this year IPL,6
[deleted],3
Imagine you are 46 and people screaming dhoni Dhoni,3
That's how you position your third man when your bowler is bowling yorkers. No luck involved.,3
Easy chase for Rinku,4
What a dead game bruh,-4
Lazy on the field?,2
Waiting for thala,4
I guess fucking dive?,6
Fucking finally,1
Looks impossible now .. but may be will get to see Dhoni bat in a lost cause.,3
"Sandy and Bhuvi on their good days are very economical....
Wickets are bonus on that if they take some....
Too much  runs required...wanted to see Zamps bowl this one, maybe next or not at all?",3
Why tf is Rajasthan not diving?,7
getting Sandy rn was stupid imho,3
"Excellent captaincy from Sanju, with a good over he can win this right here, and he also has some good leg spinners who match up well against Dhoni.",5
[deleted],3
Thala thala thala,2
Why aren't people diving,4
Anything under 40 from last 2 is chaseable,2
"Surely fixed. Bro didn't even try to stop that boundary.

 /s",6
Why is no one running in the field? They look casual.,9
If we are playing like this against RR without Boult then we really deserve to swap table positions with RCB,1
This is the kind of fielding RCB should have done yesterday against KKR. RR has demonstrated brilliance and deserve to be in the top 4.,5
Zampa should have bowled the previous over not Holder,1
Someone tell Sanju Manju to call jadeja bits and pieces player again,11
Man changes bats as soon as he gets a boundary,6
will RR bench zampa when boult comes back?,1
"Not too much to complain about in batting. Conway had an off day. It wasn't a good batting pitch to begin with but   Jaiswal brilliance and some lucky edges took the game away.


We'll do better next I guess.",2
PP is the only level headed commentator on Jio. Everyone else is fucking high on copium,2
"I think this is still achievable if they keep rotating the strike, and punish the bad balls and not lose some wickets and if the target was 180",2
sandy you beauty,2
Jadeja is useless,3
What ra shivam too much cock you are showing bro,5
2 sixes or we lose,5
Csk managed to produce such a snoozefest. I think there are 1 or 2 of these that csk produce every year when chasing big totals and shitting the bed,4
They ain't diving in the world cup year.,3
"We literally don't have anyone to bowl at death now. 
CSK can pull this off",3
"Ah they're using up Sandeep already.  
Final over - Thala smashes Holder for 30 to win it",6
Someone tell these incompetent commentators that a 6 is also a boundary.,9
Ez for RR,2
Dhoni should've come first,2
"Le rahane--test team me selection hogya hai,T20 me kyu perform krunga ab",3
Give MoM to Sandeep straightaway,5
Dube is playing like prime Yuvi.,4
How high are the commentators the game is anything but on,6
"CSK innings is *dube* *dube* 


Context- dube is drown in hindi",7
"Imagine now if RR hadn't got those runs in edges, this would have got more interesting then",10
"so they have 1 spin over or they are throwing in kuldeep and holder,, this is still possible for CSK no one knows what can happen in pressure",5
Incredible death bowling from Sandeep,1
"Bad innings from multiple people today. Conway. Jadeja. 

Even one more good innings would have got us closer.",7
Dube don't let your intrusive thoughts win,3
Just need 9 sixesüö∂,3
That‚Äôs it we are done,2
How is 41 year old Dhoni still a better batsman than Jadeja?,3
"Yes Jaddu bhai we were really lacking singles at this stage, good on you for fixing that issue",7
Bring sandeep in ict. Bro is good at death,9
Jadeja the T20 batsman is massively overrated because of his ODI and Test prowess.,12
i knew sandeep sharma has been too good and less talked,7
Even CSK fans want a wicket to fall,3
"Even a full toss from Sharma goes for a single

Edit: except the last ball",5
One 6 here and the equation will be 44 off 12. It was doable with Kohli's bowling:p,2
"Dube literally trying everything to win it for his team

Hindi commentary: Jeet hai anhoni, but aapke paas Dhoni",20
What stunning bowling,2
"I really think CSK has the same problems as India, not having enough players who can play the scoops and ramps has allowed Sandeep to bowl 125kph Yorkers all this game and he has conceded only 20 runs with 1 ball to go.",11
Lmao next over needs to go for 30 else we have no chance,4
"Abe ek chakka maar do bc

T: HIT A SEX BHENCHOD",7
"Ek tha jo stump ke peeche he pura game nikal deta tha

T-Thala",4
Rrr 23,3
FAF plays in Chinnaswammy,2
Sandy sharma take a bow! What bowling!,9
Chennai super kimgs,1
We're in the Albie Morkel zone guys almost impossible for csk now,6
CSK not winning this but it's amazing that the perception is they are still in this match. Tells you about their reputation.,12
Conway really had the law of averages working for him today,3
Dhoni not getting to bat and all those yellow shirts in Jaipur going home disappointed is hilarious you have to admit,1
Has 46 off 2 ever been chased?,6
El Memeico tmrw. Can't wait,6
Bruh jassi,2
Next over decides the game.,3
If Chahal bowls CSK are in it,5
Before this match i thought of a situation where can needs 50 odd runs in last over. Fuck,3
How come Chahar is never under the scanner of the IT department or ED. Dude has been defrauding the franchise for a while now.,7
13 ball 50 is better than fastest 50 in IPL,6
"Almost 22 runs per over needed, lol.",8
Sandy gave just 16 in 2 overs at death,13
CSK will chsse this down... You heard it here first,5
Will never understand why dhoni doesnt come earlier to bat during such situations,3
"sunte hai preity zin DREAM11 goes brrrrr
T- beauty queen interrupted by ad",2
It's over for rr,1
Only a certain right arm quick bowler can lose the game from here,3
I want sandeep to get cunted to oblivion. He‚Äôs been too good against us,0
We lost the game in the powerplay,1
"Sandeep my man, bowled so well!!",2
Can  Sanju bring a spinner on here it will be a brave call,2
if these singles were even 2's it would be fine,1
Slow start from CSK openers and Rahane not firing today costing them,5
I hope dube doesn't pull up a rinku bruv.,1
Watch Dube smack Holder and Kuldeep üò©üò©,2
"This is the risk with yorkers, you miss, get punished.

Double edged sword.",1
25 run over needed,5
Man this match is in a very weird zone. 46 from 12 is tough but nowhere near impossible,6
Is Sandy done with his overs?,4
"Yes, credit to RR, especially for the PP bowling. Pitch is a better.",2
Jadeja mokka player. They should just use him as an IP,3
Summon the **Albie Morkel vs Kohli** powers,6
No I don‚Äôt yippee fuck these idiotic ads,3
Just need a 666666 from Dube now. He will be officially Yuvi then,2
"I don't understand the More groceries commercial lol, 40 mins is still under an hour",1
Thala looks like he wanna ride that tractor back home rn,5
This over decides the match,2
They are gonna finish the innings well in time despite all the stalling after sixes being hit lmao,1
RCB had DDP Dube and Washy to groom as Indian batters and gave all 3 away. Obsessed with 15 crore purchases.,4
Come to bat dhoni‚Ä¶ you coward‚Ä¶,1
one over spin than holder ?,1
How many ads. Dear lord,1
RR really went buck wild in the last two overs of their innings. No wonder MSD was pissed,3
Wow RR scored 36 in the last 2. Well done CSK death bowling!,3
"**Jos**\-Jaiswal-**Root**\-Sanju-**Hetty**\-Jurel

Ash

**Boult**\-Sandeep-Chahal-Kuldip

Make it happen Sanga. We can use Zamps in place of Root on spin friendly wickets.",4
Rr was just nine runs ahead at this point so definitely possible,1
Again? Fuck you RR,3
Jat 8 sixes,1
If you can't pronounce yashasvi Jaiswal right on the first try we can't be friends,3
"ok, I accept the loss now,",3
Rr were 166 at this stage,3
I don‚Äôt have an issue with RR winning. Just rather they do it fairly without these bs delays. They are good enough to win without,2
Something tells me if RR and CSK faces in play-offs CSK is 100 percent going to win üíÄ,1
"Rinku chased 48 off 12, game is on.",5
Wow not of a lot of difference in the score eh,2
who is gonna bowl the 19th... surely not holder right?,2
"No holder, please no holder.
Fuckkkkkkk. It is holder. Fuck",8
Rinku made us believe that everything is possible,8
"Here they go again.

Fucking team meetings instead of just bowling.",8
Damn RR scored a lot in last two overs,4
"CSK dugout  is still calm even staring at loss,,,",8
Yuzi Chahal is Arjun Tendulkar of RR,2
Please no holder,4
We are not too behind RR at this point. Need lot of edges like them,4
last over spin will be interesting,3
Samson should have bowled out zampa before,1
"Last time those 2 met,  it was this same equation, dhoni and jaddu almost pulled it off",1
Dube ji slows down against pace compared to spin,5
Oh god its holder,3
Holder we believe in you,2
Why was moeen clapping ü§®,3
"CSK's batters especially their dinishers5 will have to start developing more shots behind square like the scoop, ramp and sweep etc against seam otherwise everyone's gonna bowl the military medium yorkers like Sandeep and win against them.",1
"zampa to bowl last over? wtf

otherwise he should have bowled out already",1
Bowling another over of Holder is just aiming for Basil Thampi's record,2
"RR made 36 in last 2 

Csk need 46",3
This match closer than it should be,2
Leave at least 25 for kuldip,3
Max csk will score is 178,3
"That was a half volley, should have been punished.",4
"Dhoni won't take the responsibility of batting, won't come ahead of Jadeja, but will blame other batsmen later if CSK lose",9
Only jadeja vs Harshal moment can save csk here it feels like.,7
This ball jaddu out please,3
Can we declare by the end of 19th over?,4
Thala should've come before jaddu today he would've smashed sandy,4
"Jadeja is so washed, he needs to be demoted down the order",8
"BC stadium shouting dhoni dhoni, what a turn off for home team",12
"I know ppl want Dhoni to come to bat, but remember he is old, let him be guys",11
Bat first isn't that bad a strategy,7
Fuckers hittttt???!!??!!??,2
Mfs bowling at wide line every ball,4
"ok the match is done ,, even CSK cant win from here calling it now",7
Hottie alertü•µü•µ,1
Unless Kohli is bowling 2 overs here CSK are dead and burried.,6
thalla is very happy sitting in dugout,3
Just 8 sixes....come on Holder you can do it,3
"Now I need an RR vs CSK final redemption arc edition, that would be a fun game to watch.",4
Holder suddenly bowling to plan. Everything materializes against CSK doesn't it?,15
CSK gonna lose in this over itself,2
RR is nailing those yorkers well.,3
Samson wanted to kill Jaiswal there,3
11 balls 41 ABD scored ones,8
"Surprised that none of the batsmen have figured out a way to attack on those wide yorkers. 

Which in turn begs the question, why not just keep bowling there throughout the innings?",6
Scenes if umpire calls it a wide,4
Let it be out please.,1
Parag on the bench üòç /s,7
Where is the intent,3
Ok. CSK is lost.,0
"Jadeja out after dhoni wore helmet



Ipl scripted??",5
need more than 4 on every ball from this point,2
Wide?,2
Jadeja doing the Dinesh Karthik,1
Jaddu marle bhai üò≠üò≠üòìüòì,2
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING,2
Out please out,4
Jaddu needs time to settle. He can't go from the first ball. Better suited for ODIs,1
Review for what? I hope we don't get a wide instead,3
Sanju tryna spice up things and get Dhoni in,2
Only if MIs death overs get like this,2
Dhoni can't do worse right?,2
Yo enough cameraman. I know Dhoni is sitting with moeen and padded up for the last 15 minutes now.,2
"I find the Dhoni chants so cringe when he's not even on the field. Why not support the players you have in the middle rather than wishing for them to get out, you can chant all you want when he comes to bat",3
Are there no screens in the stadium? Every game when Dhoni is on screen there is a wild cheer,3
thala knew it before thala for a reason,2
What the hell is jaddu doing with that sweep???,3
"Two calm captains giving terrifying stares to the fielders today.

Jaipur what have you done.",6
Abraham benjamin Dube can do it,4
I hope that he has edged that ball.,3
These 4 balls are crucial,2
Wide??,3
Samson really wants to see thala bat,3
Relax Bois thala ek six to jarur maregaüòÇ,6
Sanju doing everything to delay and throw the batsman off lol,5
Can holder give more sixes what is this good bowling,4
Csk fans in every csk match waiting for thala to bat 2-3 balls‚Ä¶ dheere dheere chupke se hauli hauli rhe intezaar mujhe tera( doing lunges like Salmon ),1
Samson trying to bring on Thala,2
wide,4
Loving the meltdown,4
Lol....Sanju doing a Karthik where wide ball is being reviewed for out üòÇ,6
Jadeja what the fuck are you doing man,4
Will it be wide then or not?,2
yea jaddu out now rr will lose shouldn‚Äôt have caught that sanju,1
What if umpire changes it to a wide lmao,1
CSK really found something in Dube. If he can hone his bowling again he could make a comeback into the Indian team,6
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU TRYING TO SWEEP WHEN YOU NEED MORE THAN 4 RUNS A BALL,7
Will the review check for wide as well?,4
How is that not a wide!!!!,4
Samsun review system !!,2
"This is 2008 throughout, CSK lost all 3 matches against RR including final.",7
Why's that not a wide?,4
"Friendship ended with MI, Now RR is my new kryptonite.",10
Rock and roll soniye,7
Bowling Holder so much it almost feels like RR are trying to lose,2
Tactical review‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,7
We have such a dumb crowd here.,5
im glad sanju reviewed that,2
One of the most absurd reviews I‚Äôve ever seen,3
Wtf was that review,2
Rajasthan crowd cheering for not outüò≠,8
Fuck,3
That death stare from Sanju!,5
Rr fans cheering that it's not out,7
All u need thala to come out damm u,3
Why does this wide yorker strategy give me PTSD of a certain final from the year 2014?,3
"Don't even care if RR lose, just don't want Dhoni to bat. Let them chant his name",5
wish we had a great finisher DK,7
Sanju adding extra to the blueballs.,5
Guys ATLEAST ten fours will save us,3
Wtf yaaayauauayuahahahahahaya,2
Even Rinku can't win these,3
"1.9 cr people watching Dubey, unreal craze of this man",5
CSK getting to 170 is a win for me.,1
With 2 left handers in it helped RR to set the same field and bowl to the same areas that's why Thala should've come ahead,2
What a shit batting performance by us. Pls recover next game boys,1
That looks like a wide,0
Thala please 36 off 6,4
Dhoni sometimes baffles me honestly,2
When I'm in a thala dickriding competition and my opponent is star sports media üò∞,9
Jaddu thinks harshal is bowling to him,1
Holy fuck that was smart by Samson. Ask for review to sweep the wide under the rug,7
Dube ji has become Pandya 2.0 under Thala,2
"Bring Thala in....
Dead done and dusted.....
CSk gave 20-25 more than they should've",6
That looked wide,4
now that was a nicr way to avoid a wide,7
Jadeja thinking he has to chase 6 out of 12 balls,9
Jadeja just can't hit it today.,3
RR should be fined for such slow bowling,3
Battle of the mids tomorrow,2
Now the match is almost unwinnable,1
"I just want Zampa to bowl last over with Dube on strike

lets get some Rinku finish anyway CSK is not winning it",1
Unpopular opinion: Sanju is a better captain than Hardik.,31
Jadeja not scoring or getting out for dhoni,1
Dhobi giving smelling his bat in world cup vibe.,2
Oh tomorrow choker is back,4
What a comeback from Holder,5
Sanju just putting tactical pressure on batters,5
How did csk ruin the chase that bad? Didn't watch the match btw,3
Amazing bowling by holder. Putting all the balls near the wide yorker area.,2
Jadeja completely useless as a batsman.,1
Dube W csk L Jaddu big L,10
I thought malinga was with mi coach?,2
"That's what not playing at your """"""home"""""" ground for a decade does to a team",3
"42 off 8 horrible 


Mf jaddu can't even read the game they are bowling wide Yorkers do something , same swepp swepp fcckckckck",13
CSK not even clapping for Dube,5
Good decision. Not wide because it hit the bat,7
Trademark Jaddu shot,3
bro they cannt hit yorkers,5
7 sixes needed now,2
"Well played Dubesy, NRR saving innings.",9
Dhoni should've come,2
They're not even trying to find a way to hit those wide Yorkers. Do something innovative if you wanna score,4
8(16) hurting CSK now,6
All blame goes to MS Dhoni. Say what you want.,6
Get some runs for godsake to avoid the nrr slump,7
Lost now for sure,1
[removed],1
jaddu rr agent,3
We can tie the match,2
Super over loading /s,2
Holder heard you guys talking shit,4
Send Harshal in and CSK can win,3
Dube 6 6's?,3
6 sixes for a super over üîú,3
6 sixes in 6 balls would be tie,5
Nobody doing Yuvi... Goodbye,1
Come on man! Get out. I wanna se thala bat!,3
Super over?,3
need 6 or match is over,2
"50 for dube, but no one cares..",5
Conway innings was crucial in the end. 45 needed from 22 without it,7
OK JADEJA PRETEND THE BOWLER IS HARSHAL PATEL,5
Dube to hit 6 sixes for a super over.,4
best case scenario is jadeja knows he needs to put some serious time in the nets now bc he cannot bat rn,6
"Dube will become a cult hero of IPL if he keeps playing like this. No foot movement, just smash",6
Great over from Holder,3
If only harshal patel was bowling,2
Friday the Kela plays,1
C‚Äômon give us thala. We‚Äôre bored.,3
CSK Loses and we don't even get to see Dhoni bat.  Waste of time.,4
6 Dube 6s incoming?,6
Rare Holder W death over. Absolutely rarest of rares,9
Powerplay and jaddu costed us the match,3
Too late Jadeja too late,2
37 needed of last over and Jaddu demands Purple to bowl the last over.....,2
 Ok chance to prove dubey if he is yuvraj,7
Harshal Patel needed to win the match,7
Dube to hit 6 sixes and take it to superover ?,3
Jadeja has done 37 of 6 earlier no big deal,5
Dube incoming 6 sixesüóø,3
dube need to do a Kingku here,2
Dube has power but he hits a 6 or 4 off the first ball of the over and thinks his job is done. Meanwhile the rate still increases even though they take 12-13 runs from an over.,1
Should've won by 50 runs minimum.,1
"bro fuck they didnt even try to hit , let thala sink in",0
dare you to bring zamps,1
Good night folks. Even six sixes cant win it.,4
Purple Patel over please?,0
"Jaddu can score 37 mfs, just send patel",4
My body is ready for a super over. Come on Dube,1
Six sixix dube you can do this,0
"Dube is a good looking lad, isn't he. Good caucasian genes, R1b.",0
Dhoni should've come before jadeja,2
Super over anyone?,1
Come on Dube the stage is set to prove you are Yuvi 2.0,1
"After a long time, viewership coming close to 2.0 cr",0
Someone call Harshal and check on him,1
Dube does a yuvraj and hit 6 sixes to take them to superover,4
"That PP damage was too big to recover from.

Needed at least 50 in PP",1
"Dhoni is teasing and fucking over all the fans across the country, lol",5
Jadeja needs to repeat what he did to harshal Patel for the win,3
I don‚Äôt see any negatives in this match and season till now except jaddu‚Äôs batting form and rayudu‚Äôs impact role,4
"Not like CSK has one of the GOAT finishers in their XI as the captain, oh wait they do...",3
Twice defeated by RR's bowling lineup,3
Sacrifice a bowler's career and get us a super over please,5
Dube needs to remember Kingu singh now,1
If Conway had gone for a golden duck this would be 45 runs off 22 balls. Much easier smh,4
MI's next match is with RR üíÄ,5
Now take it to a super over,0
Mr dube do the right thing and get out. I‚Äôd gladly take a Thala dot ball over 6 sixes,1
Sandeep should get a shout for POTM,1
"Stop blaming jadeja , the game was gone within the first 10 overs itself.",2
No purple Patel no party,0
6 sixes and its a super over,1
"great effort from Dube tho . I hope his haters can shut the fuck up now , sure the guy can't move his feets but he makes up for it by dealing in sixes only",2
Jaddu is shit in t20,1
Dhoni 2 ball cameo yet to come,4
Superover script,1
Why is MS not coming ahead of jaddu?,3
Jaddu should have just acted like he got his tissue or nerver stretched and let dhoni bat. üíÄ,1
"which team is biggest choker lsg or pbk or rcb , i feel mi kkr still have chance since 3 choking teams are fighting for 4th place. with rr win today top 3 is 80% sealed.",-1
I WANNA I WANNA WATCH THALA I WANNA I WANNA I WANNA I WANNNNNAAAAAA!!!,-2
All sixes mean a super over.,0
"C‚Äômon guys in CSK camp, don‚Äôt sit quietly. At least clap for Dube. He‚Äôs the only one who showed any intent",8
Always joy in watching CSK lose,-2
That 4 run Sandeep over killed even outside chances for CSK. Holder just made it a formality.,5
Dare I say,1
Holder only one type of bowling. Scared? Ahaha,5
Lol heavy jinxing even after winning the game,1
CSK major missing Harshal Patel rn,6
"I don't mind loosing this kinda game rather then having heart break on losing close one , RR outplayed us and deserves win....",5
"Done
Noice",2
We were 20 runs short in the power play. That‚Äôs what costed us the match,3
"So many chances when Thala could've come in. 
Ffs. .if you had to lose, atleast could've brought him in.",2
"No one can score 37 off an over, all they have to do is bowl 6 legal balls,",2
"Match over 


Done and dusted",7
Jaddu took a big L today,7
match is done,2
Fuck you Jadeja just get hit wicket,9
Only if 2021 Harshal Patel had bowled to Jaddu to get 37 runs!,5
Bro just bowl six legal deliveries,8
"This is how India bats at the death, precisely why we need players like Tewatia and Rinku because they can play Yorkers behind the square for boundaries.",10
need to drop rayudu next match,6
jaddu making sure thala doesn't face more than 2 balls a game,18
"Man, I want someone to have the same faith in that Samson had on holder and it paid off.",7
Yucks,2
Can someone please teach dube and jaddu how to play a scoop shot,5
bring a spin on Sanju dont be like this lets have some fun,2
Sad sad sad,1
Ffs dhoni should sub himself out if he cant be bothered to come in early during crunch run chases,10
Wanted Zampa to bowl final over for the jokes.,3
Yea bois we have it in the bag.,1
"That‚Äôs the game guys, we lost 2 against RR, we‚Äôre going to the finals",6
Dube the no so chinna Thala taking it deep and winning it,4
"Wait, how bad was convay today?   


8(16) chasing 200+",5
Pls 170 pls 170 pls 170,5
No tips today?,3
gg,3
Close matches once in a while is fine but convincing victories like today are so satisfying. It's like watching your team bang in 4 goals while keeping a clean sheet.,6
6 ball 6 sixes match draw yedu,3
Cmon jaddu get out man,4
Now imagine like 4 wides outta the left field. If that happens I have to absolutely meet the scriptwriter,6
"MI lost üòÄ

RCB lost üòÑ

CSK lost üòÜ",7
Thala just one six please Dube get out,5
Harshal Patel could have conceded 37 in a over though,7
No one from dugout even acknowledging Dube 50 is shameful. He isn't the reason for CSK defeat this game..,7
One of the main reason why I **slightly** feel this entire sport might be staged is the lack of consistent yorkers/wide yorkers. They seem to be unplayable but yet it's only used in the death.,3
Well....it's finally out of equation now,1
"Thala can't bat, just there for decoration. /s(?)",3
"37 needed in last over, could've bowled Zamps man.....bowled so well, took 3 wickets, would have loved to see him bowling at the death....now one of you get out and Bring Thala in.....",0
What is this good line and length don't you want to see Dhoni??,1
A wicket now would be an insult to thala.,3
"Atleast reduce the margin of defeat, so as to not go below GT's NRR.",1
Sanju for the next captain,3
"RR dominate the Jail Classico derby this season, 2-0",1
"Noone: 

Swann:SuPa oVer",3
Sanju smile üòÅü•∞,2
Now watch every team bat first if they win the toss against csk.,2
2 no balls come on lad I'm RR since day 1 but it'll be amazing scenes,1
Is Dhoni really saying Jadeja is more reliable for power hitting than himself? I love Jaddu but c‚Äômon.,2
"I hope we give RR , RPSG treatment from 2017 Mi lost them 3 times and fucked them over in final....",5
180 was par total here,1
That powerplay shitshow fked CSK,4
How the hell did CSK allow Kuldip to bowl 2 for 14 and Sandeep 4 for 24? That's how you lose matches.,4
feel bad for fans in yellow jersey in stadium,4
Ggs boys.... We're back at the top of the table!,4
Thala will come after match,6
Prediction time boys - are we gonna see Dhoni bat or not,3
Can Dube pull a rinku???,-1
Probably one of best over by Holder. RR bowlers are not at all missing yorkers. I think RR probably have strongest bowling lineup this season.,10
How much will csk nrr be affected,6
Only if Jaddu played like Jaddu from beginning,3
just hit the remaining ones enough to lose by llke 25 runs instead,1
tipsendra singh,5
I think Dube might be good choice for ICT no bad idea,1
Dhoni should have gone instead of Jadeja.Two lefties made the plan execution easier.,4
Jaddu bored the hell out of this match,4
Just get out so we can see dhoni bat,1
"Give me thala

I am sitting here watching this because of thala",0
"Last time CSK needed 36 of 4 against RR, Dhoni hit three sixes in three balls

Later, these three sixes affected the NRR as CSK finished above RR and avoided the wooden spoon in 2020 on the last day",5
Even an obvious someone won't have rided Dhoni's dick as much as star sports.,4
"RR are looking good, batting looks good. World class spinners and excellent death bowling. Maybe this is the year for them.",3
Match would've been close if not for DDP's insane luck with the edges.,7
Loving the double blow to the CSK fans who hijacked the stadium - loss + thala not batting.,2
"Time to try new impact players 

Ambati has lost it",5
[deleted],1
At least make the loss below 30 runs,3
When are we getting the batting feature update for jaddu,3
RR got incredibly lucky in the first innings with 30+ runs coming from edges. CSK's rotten luck doesn't help them one bit.,-5
I am not even a csk fan and i am fuming lol,1
"Lmaoooooooo
MSD was waiting since the 15th over

He didn't get to bat yet the team lost lmao",4
Top notch death bowling,1
"Jaddu absolutely useless in these situations.

Why did he come ahead of Dhoni?",4
"Dhoni looks mad he can't hit a last over 6

CSK gave up on this match 8 overs ago",4
Conway's innings....,1
Batting first is the best policy for RR.,3
Still a 0.01 chance ü§ìü§ìü§ì,4
Holder why do you give me mixed feelings about you always,1
Good bowler,2
Thala for a reason lads,3
Dube has no offside game.,3
How much will this hurt csk nrr wise?,1
"Well bowled kuldip,",6
I have a feeling RR is going to get knocked out by CSK in the Play-offs. I've seen similar things happen way too often especially with CSK.,1
Man just send Thala as atleast that will make this interesting.,0
Gonna assume that was Jake McLush's family,1
"When KP calls Dube long levers, it‚Äôs kinda sexual",2
Which team in the current Edition of IPL can easily chase 200+ against any other team? GT and ?,2
"4 no balls and constant 6s, hope is still alive guys",6
Blame it on mama,1
Nothing brings me more joy than a CSK loss. Their shit ass fans need to be checked,6
Thala following Sachin's instructions,3
MSD should be coming before Jadeja,5
"Thala now remove the helmet, i don't think they'll let u bat.",2
Dube vs Spin and Pace is a different batsmen all together,1
"Lord rinku>>>>>Thala 
Batting krne to aata h kam se kam 
Btw aaj sch me ummees thi thala se üôÑ",2
3 off 4 lmao,1
Sanju better than MS,2
Jaddu played like T20I Jaddu,2
Jaddu get out this ball,1
"Today‚Äôs game is why we should have never let faf go, Conway is okay but he cost us today, and Rayudu is pathetically useless",4
batting till number 8 still loses chasing,5
kuldip yadav wtf,3
"I've been saying this from the 3rd match of ours. Csk and rr are the best bat first teams in the tournament. 

When their batters don't have any chasing pressure, they go beserk and have the ability to bat out the opposition. And it's only reasonable that both times we batted first against csk and won.",9
Jadeja better than parag no cap,2
"NRR is going to take a hit,,, any advantage went away in that poor powerplay

one man having bad day in 200+ chase is all you need",6
"If MI won't be there to beat CSK in the finals, there'll be rr don't worry lol...",5
Legend has it Dube's dad is from Yorkshire,5
"Booo, no thala",2
Jaiswal was gold ü•á,9
at least minimize the loss at this point,3
Dhoni really has to start coming before Jadeja and Rayadu is done man,4
"Too much to chase in the end. Those 4 overs at the start and 2 overs at the end killed us. Gg RR, see ya PBKS on sunday",3
"RR moral victory


Denied us thala",8
Ok I complain about people getting bullied into letting MSD bat but now I will be the one bullying. LET HIM HAVE 1 BALL,7
Young Kuldip bowling pretty nicely,7
"Hmm, so it's PBKS/RCB/LSG for the 4th spot.",6
"HOLY FUCK, THEY MADE IT TO 170.

This is pretty much a CSK win in my book.",7
Ok someone get out and let Thala bat two balls. Not like we have anything to lose here. Atleast give the fans what they want.,1
Kuldip casually being selected for the team and nailing most of his wide Yorkers is such a W.,8
No ball run out for thala pls,1
"Fuck you jadeja, Thala robbed of last ball six",1
"Csk lost against all the matches versus last year's finalists

Weak teams got us thinking csk is good team",1
Can't remember the last time Jadeja played some decent t20 knocks consistently,3
It‚Äôs almost impossible for Jadu to hit a six,4
Wow who are all these bowlers? Where do RR even find them? Thought spin will be the venom today but we couldn't do squat against even their pace bowlers,9
Only 1 run? Poor Thala didn't get to bat.....,2
"RR dominated csk this year

Damn that's beautiful",8
Imagine they take wicket on last ball,5
Rr should stick to batting first rather than chasing,6
The match in Chennai had managed to go down to the last ball but this defeat is similar to the way in which RCB loses against KKR.,5
"Rayudu needs to be out, he became a stick with a bat",4
Ddp edging his way to 23 was the difference. I've never felt bad for any opposition bowler like I felt for pathirana today.,13
gg no re pls,3
"Don‚Äôt know whether to be happy with Dube or sad about Jadeja

Either way if I get a CSK jersey this year it‚Äôll be a Shivam Dube one because I made that promise",4
"Sanga should be talked more for making this brilliant balanced team of RR. 

Young players ‚òëÔ∏è

Experienced players ‚òëÔ∏è

RR has so many foreign supporters,8
Bro got out too late üò†,3
Thala will cum now,5
"Atleast, got to 170",0
"Is this another year where its going to be CSK losing to one specific team through the torunament until Final

instead of MI it being RR",10
Dube couldn't have done that earlier in the over !?!???!,3
Kuldip Yadav no way related to Umess Yadav at the death.,5
Yay Thala incoming,5
Get the camera off Dhoni,5
Axar is much better than Jadeja as far as form is concerned,0
Dube teasing thala by getting out on the last ball. Rift confirmed.,5
How good was kuldip today? Confused the batsmen with his goog‚Ä¶.I mean slower ones.,6
Is that Monty panesar in CSK bench?,3
"Should have hit 180-190 atleast. Losing is one thing, but losing by 30 runs is different. Especially in this format.",4
Yashasvi back at his Skipper.,1
Poor bowling to allow 200 on this pitch + the powerplay sealed the game for RR.,3
Now thala can play,1
Hahahah 4 off the final over lmaooooo,1
That‚Äôs literally the worst possible ending ffs could‚Äôve at least done that off the second last ball,4
Who are all those foreigners in RR jerseys?,1
"This is a very important win for RR from a DC top 2 point of view.

Well done!!",5
Bkc haar gaye,1
What a wonderful over by Kuldip too,8
"Man not first pos pls, that position is cursed",7
"Horrendous batting, zero intent good win by rr",3
"Honestly even without all those edges and lucky runs, RR would have made over 180. CSK might have struggled to get there even.",9
Yaay thala time now? /s,3
Lmao Thala to play after 20th,7
Sandeep sharma has been phenomenal this season..very underrated bowler,8
only 4 runs in this over,4
~~Catches~~ Edges win matches.,12
The team which played yorkers better won today /s,6
So dhoni didn't even get to bat and CSK lost the match wtf,11
Chanting his name for 40 overs and he doesn't even bat lmaooooooooo,18
Thala time boyz,3
Yeesss dhoni will come now,5
"RR when batting 1st: Big doge

RR when batting 2nd: Small doge",11
Finally Thala is coming!oh wait....,12
"**19.6**

Shivam Dube c Buttler b Yadav 52 (33b 2x4 4x6) SR: 157.57",2
MotM - DDP's incredible luck. Match would've been close if not for those 30+ runs off the edge.,11
"This was winnable, Conway wasted too many balls and couldn't even maintain 100 SR.",11
GG boys finally some peace after bottling those last two games,12
This is where tewatiya would've just walked across and swiped across.....,7
"Much needed win for RR this one. 

Positives from the match: 

‚Ä¢ We hit a big total despite underwhelming batting performance by the three big players (Jos, Samson and Hetmyer)

‚Ä¢ Bowling unit without usual Boult powerplay wickets was amazing

‚Ä¢ DDP is definitely getting back into form compared to his earlier innings.

‚Ä¢ Kuldip Yadav good find",14
How does RR have all these foreign supporters? Is their owner british or something?,15
Dhoni should have come ahead of jadeja -_-,8
A bowler who bowls in the 120s playing in the IPL? That's criminal. Must be because of his surname alone!,2
Insane death over bowling from RR.. they nailed the yorkers so effortlessly.,12
"You fool, you couldn‚Äôt get out one ball earlier?",14
GG Kuldip...bowled well.. 6 Eco is amazing.,12
Congrats to all 17 supporters of RR,6
Thala should open next match according to the rules right?,3
Did RR just discovered another great Death bowling option after Sandeep sharma. üòÅ,3
Dube didn‚Äôt want yadav to fall ill and lose weight. Such a pure soul,11
Thala to play 3rd innings,4
I hope CSK lose 5 wickets in first over itself next match...so we get to see thala bat 20 overs /s,6
That's you should bat 1st after winning toss,5
Presentation bro - please ask Sanju wtf was he angry for and also whats the deal with umps,7
Thala was too scared to come out and get blue balled again,3
Don't be shy bowl another two balls for thala.,2
"Thala:- mf couldn't u get out one ball before it...
51 in last 3 overs from RR
25 from CSK in last 3.
Those last 3 overs made all the difference.....",3
Csk lost the match in the powerplay. Kids blaming Jadeja for this loss might as well go and drink Harpik tbh. Expecting people to chase 60 in 3 when the opposition bowls well.,13
Thala you pussy,2
Bring dhoni why is it over ??,1
Shit powerplay with both bat and ball cost us,3
Raydu as an impact player must be relooked at CSK has better options. He just doesn't look serious and in the game mentally,10
"Other team cheerleaders : every time someone hits a four : goes crazy dancing 

RR cheeeaders: team defeated table toppers easily - mild clapping",7
points table position SWAP,6
Woah Dube is a tall guy and he looks so small next to Holder lol!,7
Keep sucking Dhoni‚Äôs dick while he relaxes in the podium!!! Worst captan ever!!!,2
amazing that CSK has got 5 wins with this shit team - brilliance of top 4 and couple of good bowlers masking the drainhole from deshpande and rayudu.  santner for moeen pls,4
"This match exposed CSK the reality, Dhoni doesn't want to bat, Rayudu and Rahane unreliable, Pace bowling is terrible",4
"Y‚Äôall say Rohit protects Arjun from bowling tough overs, when it‚Äôs actually MSD protecting himself from batting at tough positions",13
Lovely game.,6
"Thala for a reason,kya handshake kiya",2
If somehow kuldeep sen and obed get fit they will have a seriously good attack,3
"I think the top 4 teams will start losing games in second half of the IPL. Let‚Äôs say they keep on winning then CSK, GT, RR, etc are gonna be on top. That‚Äôd mean that JioCinema will be stuck with lower viewership (may be except CSK, GT and RR number of viewers are in Lakhs). So, to get the excitement going again, they (scriptwriters) will bring in a twist so the entire nation will remain interested. 

RemindMe! 1 month",3
I'm not taking Jadeja to 2024 T20 WC. Axar is just so clear,5
Dude got out on the last ball of the innings. Damn. No MS show. üòåü´£,6
Sigh back to waiting for Thala‚Äôs press conference,3
Laal Singh's director watching that dream 11 ad be so fucked up lol,7
More concerning thing is that this thread has only 6.7k comments.,6
RR saved because thala didn't come to bat üíÄ RR won all thanks to thala,7
Where Thala finishes off in style?,-6
gotta be fair with jadeja. His innings wasn't even that bad. The game was half lost before he came to bat.,5
Used to remember this ground as a fortress of RR.,12
Top of the table again lessgoo,6
"Conway killed the game, don't fucking balme Jadeja for this.",10
Forget MI. I'mma beef with RR from now on.,20
If LSG wins tomorrow then CSK will be 4th,9
DDP was riding his luck today to score those runs. Otherwise guy can't power hit,3
What‚Äôs with the sudden Dhoni hate,17
Took out deadweight Parag and RR became virtually unbeatable.,15
Dont let the rare batting slip up hide our shitty pace attack.Its high time we do something about it,9
RR might have a couple of problems but CSK isn't one of them,18
GT at 5th May will be interesting here.,6
Conway playing an ODI innings in honour of his countrymen who are doing the same across the dessert.,10
Ppl were too worried about boult missing out. We've done it twice without him against csk.,19
"This game had so much happening lol

YBJ batting , Jurel and Paddikal cunting , Rutu getting good start , Zampa casually being best spinner , Dube cunting sixes for fun and Kuldeep nailing Yorkers on debut...


Don't forget Parthirana bowled well and went for 44 runs üò≠üò≠üò≠",26
Give Dhruv Jurel MOTM you cowards,11
"Idk what's sanga justification of keep playing holder  , leak runs n doesn't bat",6

They should make top 6 qualify,5
Tactical loss to ensure we finish 2nd instead of first üëâüß†,22
RR nrr üíÄüôè,17
So much difference Dhruv Jurel's inning did there now imagine Riyan Parag in that position.,14
"RR won because Dhoni didn't bat, right? Thala for reason",4
RR won against CSK only to be losing against PBKS,13
RCB lurking on 5th position just to get in the playoffs and get out in eliminator,21
thala is number 8 batsman. why so much fuss?? but yeah he should learn to bowl to be an asset.,5
Which team is Kuldeep yadav playing for,0
Forgot Moen he needs to be sacked along with Rayudu bring in couple of bowling options atleast,-6
"Not too disappointed about this loss. 

Jaiswal was brilliant tonight. Akash was no match for him. 

Rare stinker from Conway but he's a consistent performer so no worries.

Moeen looked in good touch, Dube continues his red hot form.

Theekshana finally arrived and Pathirana is nailing yorkers at 150 kmph.",17
If Holder isnt batting then Bring Boult in his place and let Zampa stay. This bowling lineup will become better than many International teams forget about other franchises,19
Hayden can't stop calling Pathirana as Pathiranga to save his life lol!,12
Why didn't dhoni come out to bat after the fall of Moeen Ali? What happened to the left and right hand combination at the crease to make bowlers life harder,8
"Underutilized Indian Player defeated your Thalua and his team, twice this season",4
"Everyone wanting MS to bat before Jaddu ,What do we get from that? I would rather watch Jaddu in these situations considering he is the finisher for Indian ODI team and world cup is near. MSD has nothing to prove. Hardik and Jadeja need to play better",14
There is a saying... You need to get out of your comfort zone to achieve the unachievable... CSK has now brought out of their comfort zone... This aligns them to the path of glory... (dhoni's last IPL) there is a calm before the storm.. Enjoy it while it lasts...,10
when's our next match?,4
RR will probably need to win only 4/6 of their remaining games because of their run rate,7
Play this post match interview on loop,8
Sad day comrades....sad day,5
Don't play Rajasthan Royals ever again. Best IPL 2023 winning advice in my opinion.,20
Thala‚Äôs really gonna cunt bowlers today,13
"Ish sodhi and rachin Ravindra playing cricket in Pakistan. Moeen and adil playing ipl in india.  

Immigrants find a way.",29
Bring Ryan back to nerf these mfs,11
"How is NRR calculated? RR run rate was 10.1 and CSK was 8.5. So +1.6 to RR. 

Yet their current RR is just 0.9? I don't think it was -0.7 before this match.",-4
Dhoni came in to ~~bat~~ talk at 23-16.. Thala for a reason ü´°,17
Zampa doesnt look too good in pink,-6
"Given MS career his first match ended up in runout and last match too 

His first match as captain ended up in tie and last match too

So looks like his first and last final of IPL will be against same team in losing cause.....",28
Was almost expecting Zampa to speak like eleven. His Aussie drawl is pretty jarring.,17
[deleted],17
This is all thala's plan to defeat RR in final. They will take us too casually like we defeated you two times you noobs and that will backfire form them.,24
[deleted],5
"Fans : we came to see you bat thala

Thala 0(0) üòé",27
"For all the Sandeep underrated comments: I feel for someone who has watched him from the first day of his career, he has been rated very well by the fans of the game. It's the hierarchy or the BOSSES who ignore his talent. He has a monster's mentality if anything.",29
"whatever happened to hangargekar

didnt he look good the few times he bowled",14
Wow so we've slipped to third now? Wonderful. A top 2 finish feels like a fantasy now given how RR and GT are playing,15
"All this hate on thala. He fucking keeps for 20 overs at this age and we expect him to come at 4 and smash everything? Half of us can't even keep for 2 overs continuously without messing it up, No hate will be tolerated against thala this season ‚úä",29
"This payback week has been more of a playback week, two reverse fixtures with the same results.",12
Holder missed 50 by 1 run,11
Who would have thought dropping nepo kid Parag and giving chance to a deserving youngster can make a difference. Literally every person who watches cricket except RR management.,23
rayudu must be the least impactful impact player ever,29
"So it is no longer secret Dhoni is just there as a captain, we all know Jaddu can manage 1 or 2 boundaries, the exceptional finisher used to be thala, I think it's over he is not even going to pretend",27
"DC has two piss easy games against no bowling line up CSK.

There is still hope for top 2!",12
"Idk why this loss doesn't hurt much we lost to a good team which outplayed us in every department be it bowling or batting

Only thing I'm annoyed about Parthirana bowling so well and those edges going for runs not like it would've made difference but this game doesn't give what you want.....",39
Sanju winning the IPL will be slap on the face of the likes of Chetan Sharma.,45

If any fucker will say anything bad about Dube the batter ever again....I'll impale the fuck out of him,20
Herbalife dudes look like they are coming from a party in Goa,21
I badly want csk to win this IPL,-28
Imagine Rahane never fires for the rest of season now that he's selected in national squad. Ahaha,42
RR is a better batting first team because they don't have a lot of experience in batting because of which they sometimes can't handle the pressure of chasing Also with this bowling lineup you should defend every match,37
"So, RR is the only team to defeat CSK twice this season. My mind says it is gonna be 4-0 at the end of this season.",42
Haha Yashavi,9
Karthik think he‚Äôs funny trynna roast Samson. Fucking chuth,37
"The way in which Conway and Rahane have played suggests that the team had planned that poorly. They should have not bothered about getting out for a golden duck and every batsman should have been playing aggressively from the beginning. You shouldn't be losing like that when Dube had gotten out during the last ball, Jadeja was still there and Dhoni had not come in to bat. I wouldn't be criticizing about the bowlers because they have been punching above their weight during almost all of their other matches.",39
"WTF MURALI KARTIK CALLED ONE OF THE BEST T20 BATTERS EVER A SNAIL.

"""I felt his (Pathirana) bowling was very good, not that he bowled badly. The scorecard doesn't reflect how well he bowled."".....i feel the same way MS...lad had a horrible luck today",42
"Dhoni NEEDS to come further up the order during chases. The moment Rayudu got out, he should've decided to shift the batting order and come in 1 or 2 wickets later to build his innings.

WTF does coming in at 8 mean during a 200 chase?",35
I really don't understand why Dhoni can't come before Jadeja. Jadeja doesn't perform well while batting in T20s. His shitty slow batting makes CSK lose the match. Even bowlers can hit more runs facing less deliveries than him.,22
