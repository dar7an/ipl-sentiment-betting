Clash for top spot. Let's go!,5
Zampa & Stoinis tonight. ( ˘ ³˘),5
For once RCB vs Delhi isn't for the wooden spoon,13
Cannot wait to see Stoinis smash Zampa's balls,14
"*Amit Mishra is injured & ruled out of IPL.*

Replace **Hetmyer** with **Lamichhane**, and bring **Ajinkya Rahane** in the XI. The XI would be perfect.",4
"Stoinis and Zampa matchup please. Kohli, i know Morris is available but please play Zampa.",3
$15 on RCB. Let’s go Koach,3
Is Morris fit ffs,5
"It's makes me sad that no matter who wins tonight, we go down to second on the table.",6
"Even DC admin ships [Stoinis and Zampa](https://www.instagram.com/p/CF8z3ELKJsU/?igshid=35izvxownn0e)

RCB better play Zampa today",4
Zampa vs Stoinis !!!,10
"For now I think Axar in makes sense but if the Ashwin/Axar combo doesn’t click, bringing in Jinx/Lamichhane for Hetmyer/Axar could be an exciting option. I do think Hetmyer should be persisted with but DC can hardly go wrong giving Rahane a shot. He just needs to know what role it is that they want out of him and then execute accordingly. Doubt Ponting is going to tolerate him coming out at 1 down and batting at 110 SR. But I think he is capable of a lot more.",4
I would believe 2020 is really messed up if RCB wins 3 in a row!,13
"DC might be sporting a new jersey today, altho not sure it could just be promotional stuff for IG as I haven't seen the actual jersey",8
Don't think any team needs Rahane type player except maybe CSK.,1
Supporting RCB only because I want Koach to win it this year so that people will shut up about his Captaincy,6
I really want to see a young team like DC go far for a change. Although I would love to see both teams in the playoffs,5
Just realizing how much balance Stoinis gives that Delhi side. Just like Russell for Kolkata and Pollard for Mumbai. Basically eases the pressure on the third seamer and the spinners quite a bit and saves them from having to bowl slog overs.,1
I honestly don't know why DC invested in 5 openers this season,5
"this is going to be a meme match , i can sense it",5
"The pre-show is like 20% analysis, 80% ads wtf",15
Moeen Ali replacing zampa and morris replacing udana are the two changes I would like to see.,1
Anyone know the name of the song in the bOAT ad?,3
"Just give us a super-over finish, we haven't had one for a few matches and I need my drug!!",12
"Last few matches has been meh, I hope we get to see a close match today",4
"I don't like the new age fans declaring a match boring if it doesn't go till the last over. Most cricket matches doesn't go till the last over and it has been this way for the past 25 odd years of me watching cricket. A contest is interesting even at times when it is one sided, the talent and art are still pleasing to watch even if it doesn't go till the last ball.",10
Hoping Parthiv is selected. He is RCB top 3 batsman and is a match winner,0
Toss?,1
Play Parthiv as a specialist keeper you cowards,3
I don't know whom to support cuz mi would anyways be second after this match,2
"Pawan Negi, professional 12th man ™️",46
Mr nags in for gurkeerat?,10
AB vs Rabada!,5
"Isn't reddit working, refreshed so many times with no new comments",4
Gonna have to jump up and down and shout for RCB today 'cause of my Worcs Bro Ali... and I'll also be whoring myself out for some collateral support when it comes to the **Mighty Royals** / DC game on Friday.,4
Can we just have a moment of silence for Gurkeerat Singh. My man was in the playing 11 for two matches and he neither batted nor bowled.,84
Why are Dc wearing a different jersey today?,7
What's the Jersey change about for DC today?,6
Yo what even is that new Delhi Capitals jersey?,6
[removed],-10
Rooting for Royal Challengers from Bangalore!,3
Siraj playing lol,2
Why not bat first,8
NOOO NOT SIRAJ,13
Why do they use CGI drones so much in the graphics? Looks kinda cheesy IMO.,10
gg bois Siraj is playing,30
Lord siraj playing today . RIP RCB,6
RCB have won the toss and have elected to lose tonight's match /s,4
"Ah well, it was good while it lasted.",6
Ohh fuck Siraj playing.Expect a runfest.,14
Am i remembering wrong or was Siraj worse than spray and pray last year?,4
"Won the toss, chose to bowl and picked siraj.....gg dc",4
PRESS F TO PAY RESPECT FOR RCB and SIRAJ!!,6
"Big spiel on cricinfo about how all Dubai wins have been from batting first and RCB's last two wins have been batting first.
Virat: *we will bowl first*",6
[removed],-8
"so virat, what you gonna do?

*Mahi bhai""",4
No Zampa-Stoinks romance today on field as Zampa is missing out from XI.,5
Alright DC you win. 2 bad decisions by rcb before even starting the match,3
"please spare us the agony and start dc with 50/0 , i dont want to watch siraj",17
Morris for Zampa was the only change I wanted.,8
Mishraji ruled out of the tournament,5
**I think they have covered two post match presentations with captain of RCB with that speech length**,4
Mishraji out of IPL ☹️,7
Damn CSK made RCB shit their pants at the prospect of defending even though they weren't even playing them,-15
tho i feel bad for Mishi bhai and Bhuvi... hope they'll come back stronger,3
No Zampa vs Stoinis. What’s the Purpose of watching IPL if the contest that you’re waiting for is not happening?,10
So morris is getting free money. Nice.,6
"Honestly this is not bad team selection from RCB at all. 2 bowlers to replace 1 leaky bowler, even if they’re not the most economical themselves and Moeen who is definitely a welcome addition to the middle order. Dude can hit.",8
RCB really testing 2020 and playing Siraj.,70
Is morris not 100% fit yet ? Wtf is rcb thinking here,2
"Yeah but yesterday CSK won here chasing, so don't be so quick to judge",5
Is r/cricket meme power too strong to bring siraj back in form or am I crossing the line?,15
"I can already picture it. Siraj walking back to his bowling mark, head down after just getting sent over cow corner for a collosal six and the camera pans to Virat, who's got a tear in his eye. Gg boys",17
Fuck.,2
"Shreyas Iyer loves vada pav too!

Can this guy get any more cooler?",5
"I start to sweat, as soon as I hear Siraj. I hope I am wrong",8
Siraj might not be such a bad bet. He does bowl well upfront which means we can save more overs of Udana for the death.,14
"Before he retires, anytime in the next 7 to 9 years, I would love to see Koach in Delhi. Even if it's just a season. He's a Delhi boy, I'd like to see him bat here.",11
Now the tournament will be set alive by one and only siraj,8
Morris for isuru..and this team is pretty good,1
7 bowling for rcb today,2
I'm scared,3
Honestly they need to keep faith in Umesh Yadav. He's experienced and a proven international bowler.,0
RCB with Siraj in it?  Need a prematch jizz. Right back.,3
Where is Scott even standing rn 🤣,1
Siraj might not bowl all 4 if Moeen Ali chips in,2
"It's time to meme siraj to greatness guys, bring it on r/Cricket",12
LETS GO LORD SIRAJ BACK IN THE HOUSE BABYYYY,3
"Putting my money of DD today .

Too many changes for RCB.",-5
"From Cricinfo: *Delhi Capitals, who had lost a sponsor or two in the lead-up to the season, seem to be sporting a new jersey with quite a few new logos*

Damn good boys, must be motivated.",8
Siraj is why RCB fans have ulcers,6
"KP: ""As a batsman, you want to face the pace guys here.""

Kohli: Siraj in. 

F",11
Please meme Siraj as much as possible,28
RCB fans: I fear no man. But that thing (siraj taking his run-up) it scares me.,13
Ffs why siraj? There was absolutely no need for this gamble.,5
"Zampa's not playing, big stoin must be sad",3
Moeen ail is not in good form.,0
As usual RCB's biggest opponent is RCB itself. Please contain the devil within.,9
">Adam Zampa misses out with a stomach bug

Stoinis: sad noises",26
Kohli seems rude and arrogant only on the field. Dude genuinely looks like a cool guy to hang around and party,19
"RCB: Wins the last 3 matches

Kohli: Time to change the lineup",8
Koach RTG back in action.,4
Moeen Ali in IPL > Maxwell,11
Dc can start eperimenting. RCB bring opposition players back to form. Pollard and Kishan are fine examples of this,2
"Delhi can treat this ground as Sharjah, now since Siraj is in RCB XI",5
"If Siraj gets a hat trick this game, 2020 has officially gone too far",12
"Me sees Siraj on the squad.


Grabs Popcorn.",13
Pant sees Siraj: It's free real estate,30
"Are Delhi wearing the rainbow jersey for this game. If so, pretty cool.",2
Who the hell gave Pant an 88 stamina score,5
Are harshal and axar Patel related,3
"Lmao winning 3 in a row will feel weird

I'm DC this game",9
Zampa is unable to compete .... Marcus you sly dog you,5
"Quick reminder ,Koach decided to chase after winning the toss.


If RCB win today 2020 might see RCB in the final again.",3
Siraj will rock today ᕙ(  • ‿ •  )ᕗ,4
"Damn, RCB going with 4 bowlers plus Ali, Dubey, Sundar. 

Later Morris coming in for maybe Udana will make batting even stronger. 

Although Siraj will be a weak link.",6
Why Siraj whyy,2
Would Ali be opening or supporting the middle order?,2
DC is a seriously good side. That Iyer+Pant partnership last game was something else!,8
"So much excitement for siraj being in, I forgot the amazing feeling when both their stars umesh and siraj used to entertain other teams",6
If Moeen fires today RCB can chase pretty much anything,3
"Don't worry guys we have 7 bowling options. If Siraj reaches Lord status early on, Kohli can cut him off.",8
Am i the only one who likes this jersey for delhi much better than the original,7
"Siraj gonna hit half century today, in bowling.",6
Gurkreet made no contribution but Siraj makes negative contribution,17
Oh damn just realised today was supposed to be zampa vs stoinayy. Rcb did us wrong,10
"~~Can’t believe they’re not playing Zampa. RCB really are pushing Poinis agenda~~

edit: didn’t know about Zamps, hope he gets better soon!",1
Twist in the tale - r/cricket got caught completely off guard when Siraj ends up with four-for at an economy < 7,12
My son is supporting RCB. I think someone is going to get a life lesson tonight.,72
I just want RCB to win a close one so they go the top of the table with the shittiest NRR,10
"Dev, Aaron, Virat, ab, moeen this is prob our best possible batting lineup but we all know what  Rcb's problem is",7
My heart is with RCB but mind knows that DC will most probably clinch this one.,3
Didn't know DC had a match today,3
"Excited for South African competition 

Rabada + Nortje VS ABD",5
LORD SIRAJ,1
Any changes in the lineup?,0
I'm sad no one mentioned hetmyer vs his first ipl franchise,3
Who do you think will win tonight?,0
Does KP never get a night off?? I'm so sick of his voice already.,5
"Ok so here’s my theory. Sunny G made that comment about Anushka. Anushka made that post. Virat went back to her and told her she might have overreacted a bit. They had a huge fight. Virat has been sleeping on the couch ever since (Koach on couch situation). He is not getting enough rest and as a result is not pumped up in the field. As a consequence he is not putting undue pressure on his players to perform at his level. He is more like ‘meh, whatever’. So his players without the burden of expectations are doing alright. And they have only Sunny G to thank for it. Thoughts ???",33
"press F for teams playing in RED, bois",3
It's like DC is promoting the LGBTQ community with that rainbow on the jersey,9
I'm gonna miss the Mishra Pant combo :(,1
I love Udana,2
Why did the DC uniform change?,4
How long before Dhawan plays one useful innings?,4
Is it just me or does RCB have a relatively weak bowling lineup?,3
"Thats a good jersey for Dc, arent Rcb supposed to have 2 jerseys (away and home)",-1
Udana is in after Udon meal and traveling via Udaan from Sri Lanka.,-2
Let's gooooooo Rcb!!!!,6
"DC's batting side looks extra strong today, especially with Siraj playing 💔",9
Is the rainbow on Delhi’s jersey for lgbtq?,3
does anyone know who was the hindi commentator in the last rcb match who sounded a lot like parthiv patel?,1
I hope DC posts around 190 atleast to make the match more competitive ..since its the same.pitch as yesterday's CSK match it should not be difficult to post it,1
"Delhi legit has the “perfect formula”

5 proper batsman:
Openers (Shaw, Dhawan)
Anchor/Aggressor (Iyer)
Strikers (Pant, Hetmeyer)

All rounder:
Striker/bowler (Stoinis)

2 spinners who can provide with the bat in axar and Ashwin 

2 proper international bowlers with brute pace.

1 Indian bowler who can come in through the middle overs 

What? I’m not jealous",77
"the clash for the top spot, leggo",2
"KP sees jersey no 69: I wonder why did he choose that, shiva can you ask him",3

Anyone else hate 3 digit jersey numbers?,14
really digging DC’s new jersey as a gay person,7
"This game fells very surreal. Any other year, and this game would be a desperate attempt to not be wooden spoon candidate. But now these teams are playing to top the table.",6
Why are DC wearing a different jersey? Isn't pride month over?,1
Delhi slowest in powerplay according to stats..Slower than chennai ..but staying at the top of table shows they build a solid base and capitalise,5
Surprising how we already havent heard how rewarding this Cred Powerplay could be,4
Oof,1
"Since My Boi Bhuvi is out and the situation being more grim from here on, I'll support DC.",3
Shaw is just Short Sehwag,4
"Jersey is not for LGBTQ, promotion for JSW Paints -

"Dread it. Run from it.

AB’s back injury is inevitable",2
This first over would make Siraj's over look average.,4
Looking like a 50+ day for udana,7
Why do we play this wanker. He is so shit.,5
Proud boys of DC,5
Pain.,2
"- Udana Opening  
- Siraj Death Bowling 

coming up today",12
Udana fucked,1
F,0
Why is green missing from the DC jersey?,1
Shaw clearly had cough syrup before the game,2
All eyes on the LORD.,5
why is udana bowling anywhere but the death?,2
"*Delhi's official sponsor is JSW PAINTS. That's why the colours. Instead it looks like a shade card that you wanna refer to, to paint your room wall*",3
Siraj must be relieved now,2
Liverpool fans assemble here. Let's sobb together,2
Is DC actually supporting the LGBT+ movement or is this some random stuff?,4
Brian Lara got a good point. Why ball a slower ball with new ball which can swing & seam?,3
First year I decide to watch and Malinga is gone and Udana is the only SL player smh..,7
Why the jersey change all of a sudden?,0
Should have been 14/0 after 5 overs :( We are fucked.,2
"Washyyyyy

Happy birthday",7
We were all ready for Lord Siraj but Lord Udana came out of the blue,5
"Yo what's this, new jersey or temporary?",0
Honesgt question for Delhiites. Who are you guys supporting?,0
Siraj is wearing a head band... nothing more to add,3
Lets hope Dhawan doesn't fall to the sweep yet again.,0
So Udana has no control as well. RCBs only hope is Morris,1
"                   ***ATTENTION***

Moeen Ali is playing. I repeat Moeen Ali is playing! Everyone stop what you're doing and watch so that you can appreciate the elegance of this man. Fear the beard!",26
"A lotta guys wanted Ali in team instead of Zampa, now watch him shit the bed today.",1
Prithvi should get rid of that awful moustache,14
Sundar bring the pressure back on baby,5
"As long as RCB keeps Dhawan at the crease they are safe. Once he’s gone, absolute carnage ensues.",9
here to see a high scoring game for memes,2
Is morris still injured,7
Download cred baby download cred.,4
"“Saini is quick, real quick. And Siraj.... he also has.. good pace” LOOL",12
LORD KHALEEL = LORD SIRAJ,1
Chahal just spat on the field. Is that allowed?,3
Inb4 Siraj 4/17,6
"Even though the sponsor is the reason, the DC kit is mint",9
"Oh hey Mr.Downvoter, good to know you are here. Love you too",4
RCB is putting too much pressure on ABD by asking him to keep. It feels like it's inevitable that he would breakdown from the workload and RCB would be gigantically fucked.,23
Udana has been expensive,4
At this point why don’t try out Rahane instead of Dhawan?,4
Cmon Delhi,5
What's the noball rule for bowling from outside the box?,2
excited to see mohan ali,9
"Alright, Dhawan shouldn't be India's 3rd opener in T20i. Bring in someone else",4
Beautiful over by sundar,3
Udana really needs to work on his length. Bowling short with that pace ain't gonna help him.,7
God I hate this jersey... the blue is so offf,1
"Calling it now, Siraj gonna bowl the spell of his career and shit on r/cricket",10
Washington in PP is doing miracles for RCB economically,6
Nice shot,0
"Another bad decision not to select Parthiv, will certainly come to haunt RCB",1
Saini bb noooooo what you doing? :(,5
Since we memed Thakur into being a proper death bowler! Maybe we can do that with Siraj too!,8
Rcb are fucked even before siraj is introduced,7
Pant to Hetmyer: “Zomato pe dekhiyo koi accha offer hai Kya?”,5

We are in for a big score here I think.,1
"RCB Bowler losing their shit, and Siraj hasn't bowled yet",26
"I recently learned what sundar means in Hindi. I can't believe none of the commentators have said. ""Washington, you sundar"" after he bowls a good over or picks up a wicket.",7
ngl those stripes look cool,1
I guess today it's Shikar's turn to get back into form.,0
Hahaa nice from kohli there,5
Where is the guy that is the lucky charm for Rcb? Please watch today’s match.🥺🥺🙏🏻,10
Waiting for lord siraj to bowl,0
Saini looks like a guy who’s always calculating how money he owes to the cigarette shop,39
God damn it even Saini's radar is a bit off,2
Looks like siraj gave some pre match tips to saini,13
"Good fielding,  was boundary written all over that",7
Kohli was about to put saliva on the ball and stopped just before it lmao,7
Kohli was just about to apply Saliva to the ball lol,13
lol virat with saliva,5
F*** it bowl fast,7
Holy shit! What a shot,8
virat stop using your tongue now you are in ground.,8
Fuck man nice shot,5
Man Kohli is going to absolutely cunt Ashwin out of the park tonight. He has played Ashwin way too many times in the nets,5
Holy shit what a shot that was. Proper orgasm.,9
I came a little from that shot,3
Why are DC sporting the Pride flag?,6
Koach nearly licked the ball lol,7
Prithvi Shaw is basically Sehwag on coke,12
lol wth was that shot,4
"Pitch report says the pitch has absolutely nothing to offer for the bowlers

Koach: Yassss! We bowl first",24
"That's some six really,  shaw just don't fear at all",8
i feel like rcb are going to lose this match really badly,5
Wtf. Looks like we are playing in Sharjah but we are not.,5
"Bruh pacers are getting murdered, I fear for Siraj.

**28** off the two overs of pace until now, the ball is coming on nicely and racing to the boundary in this outfield every time",11
"Fuck off with your ""UNACADEMY"" six!!!!",8
Alright I want Shaw to play well but also don't want Saini to be trashed,8
Shouldn’t Koach sanitize his hands now?,16
Saini pulls of his mask to reveal it was Lord Umesh all along,7
Fun fact: Prithvi Shaw is older than Sehwag.,15
Siraj to become prime Steyn today,4
14 of over from each seamer,3
"Yall need to chill, there was nothing wrong with sainis deliveries there",5
Loved the shot from Shaw!,5
Watching Shaw bat is equal measures exciting and scary,7
This unacedemy shouts out after a six seems so cringe,5
"Damn Prithvi striking at 200 already, guess Dhawan is gonna play the anchor",4
Lord Siraj already affected Udana and Saini,6
"So this is why India will never be trash again huh? All these young players rubbing shoulders with all the greats of the game, not fair man..",8
"Alright its gonna be ""that"" type of game",18
I started my day early at work just so I could watch this from the start.,10
Is it too much to ask if I want to see RCB on top of the table?,4
Ooo turn. So no 200 tonight,6
Only Delhi look as strong as Mumbai or Chennai for the playoffs,2
Siraj is going to get a wicket in his 1st over and make us look like fools,12
Well the good times had to end eventually,10

"The amount of crap /r/Cricket talks about others, they wouldn't be able to take half of it if they got bullied.",94
"Abd calling Kohli biscuit, cute",21
Harbhajan sitting at home watching a bowler he complained couldn't spin the ball end up with every kind of economical and dot ball record he had in his prime!,14
Sundar has been poor gold,15
"AB or Pant, who is more annoying behind the stumps?",1
Saini looks like the guy who’s always calculating how much money he owes to the gutka shop ಠ_ಠ,5
No Zampa Stoinis today :(,6
Ashwin always performs against RCB. Let's see what he can do today.,1
Aww Virat and AB call each other 'Biscuit'. Cute ☺️,3
"*""Run him out""*

ABD is a cutie",11
Doesn't look like siraj will bowl his full quota of overs.,5
damn sehwag really let himself go didn't he,4
Has anyone tried Kohli's Wrogn stuff? Are they expensive? Are they good? I'm quite curious.,14
"This guy played 3 games last season, wth Virat",4
Wicket keeping might take a toil on Ab. They will be royally fucked,8
Moeen 😍😍,5
sundar is poggers. hope this comment dont jinx it,9
Sundar is Ati Sundar in powerplay,4
I hope we stop using Jadeja in t20s from now on and stick to only one specialist wrist spinner. There are better options like Krunal and Sundar who need to play in the 2nd allrounder role alongside Hardik.,12
Hope stoinis bats above hetmyer today. Dude is getting wasted that low,4
Rcb felt bad for kxip,4
Washy ain’t bowling pies even tho it’s his birthday!,10
Shaw has as much raw talent as brohit.,8
Was the issue of Kohli’s jealously over Moeen’s beard resolved? Cos I can see Moeen playing today,13
Ati sundar over,5
"Can't belive even with IPL happening, India's only option ater Dhawan to open with in T20i in 2016 was Rahane.

\*Remembers 2016 SF against West Indies* :(",7
If AB was a suitable long term keeper I’m sure RCB would have gone down this road before. The additional workload must surely be impacting his batting.,5
So Washington sundar is the right hand version of early Ravi jadeja.,6
"RCB fans I have to inform you that RCB will be shit for the first hour or so of this match because I, a man who seems to be RCB's good luck charm given they've won every match of theirs I've watched, will be unable to watch for the first hour because I'm busy

But fear not, I will be back in about 50 mins and Virat Kohli's barmy army will rise again",54
"Even Saini is getting hit, doesn't look good for Siraj",5
Can teams afford to play conservatively against both Chahal and Sundar or will we see them take risks against these two later in the tournament?,2
Whatever happens today Siraj’s 4 overs going to be FUN,8
"Hetmyer vs RCB today, will be very interesting",3
Ali is not equally potent as Zampa with bowling? Ali is a better option right? Why the change took so long,3
Washington MVP sundar,4
Moeen makes middle order look x15 better,8
Chahal so early bc?? Saving Siraj for the death o wot?,4
"Ok so here’s my theory. Sunny G made that comment about Anushka. Anushka made that post. Virat went back to her and told her she might have overreacted a bit. They had a huge fight.

And they have only Sunny G to thank for it. Thoughts ???",7
Wow haven’t see a spinner nominated power play in awhile,3
damn DD has new colors for clutch games.,5
"Unpopular opinion:

Is Finch really needed for RCB? 

Parthiv was doing decent enough as Opener. Had 140+ SR in his last 2 seasons with 27+ avg. in both season.

Finch in IPL tho is always less impressive than his T20I heroics and had a horrid last season(2018) averaging 17 and this year he's averaging 27 and striking at 121. 

Reason am saying this is, now ABD has been forced to keep which will be disastrous for RCB in the long run.

Once Morris is available he could replace Finch imo.",8
Would be damn funny if dube and Ali bowl siraj’s 4 overs,4
No risks against Chahal 6-7 per over do more than enough...No brain less slogging please,5
Rcb are gonna bowl Siraj at the death aren't they??,6
With Siraj on the team I've got a very bad feeling.,10
Chahal in powerplay. Lord Kohli in full flow.,6
Nortje with 200 SR.,2

Shaw has been so good,5
"Oh boy

Is Delhi supporting LGBT 🏳️‍🌈community? Just asking.,3
SHOT DORAEMON!,3
Haha I was just typing a comment about how DC should play Chahal out and Shaw does that... wow,2
This is the kind of risk you can forgive for a bowler for bowling tbh .,4
"Show really is a class above other youngsters,  isn't he?


 He feels like already a world-class player, looks the part too.",5
Champions always comeback. Chahal will be back,1
needs to try a topspinner here everything else will travel,1
Does Sunny call everyone a very good fielder?,3
We getting a repeat of CSK innings or what,5
"""Chahal is a brilliant fielder""",3
194 - 4 DC today.,1
Prithvi Shaw-T? Are you trying to flirt with him?,6
"As long as Delhi doesn’t reach some record breaking score, rcb should be confident since Kohli is back in form and even their batting is deep with ali in",7
"Shaw is going to have a Sehwag like career, absolutely great to watch on some days, absolutely frustrating and making you tear your hair out on others.",6
Lovely!,1
"Ok, bois. We're chasing 210.",6
I trust kohli to chase anything below 300,7
Trump card or a trumpet,3
Sunny G - Chahal is a brilliant fielder,4
"chahal getting brutalized.
Licking my licks waiting for Siraj.",1
Shaw is showing off. Cmon RCB show him to the Pavillion!!,4
"No Sunny, Chahal is not a brilliant fielder. He is probably the worst fielder in that team.",5
"DC going berserk, big score incoming",1
Dhawan joining the party,1
Shaw is kinda McCullum type but is being coached by Ponting. Gill is kinda Ponting type but is being coached by McCullum. IPL ❤️,6
Oh damn son Chahal,1
Chahal during powerplay lmao,0
Did SunnyG just call Chahal a brilliant fielder?Done with this guy.WTF,17
This will be KXIP v RCB all over again.,3
For once Dhawan doesn't get out trying to play a sweep,5
When has chahal in powerplay ever worked,1
need breakthrough bowler siraj asap.,10
Spare a thought for Rahane.,6
Who has Moeen replaced?,3
RCB back in form lads,4
Wonder if Chahal will make his test debut around 30 and end up like Herath! Great bowler just arrived late because of others,3
Is Fox broadcasting the stream at 60fps? It looks ridiculously smooth.,6
Chahal’s fingers & Cricket ball - name a worse pair of arch enemies,3
[deleted],1
[deleted],2
"Just like CoolDeep , will Axar Patel be on Moeen's radar today?",3
Chahal is a brilliant fielder?,3
"""Sharing se pyaar badta hai""

Swingers alert",3
"Ok,so how was that ball lost?",1
How popular is whiskey in India?,3
"Delhi's kit looks like they are trying to promote Pride in UAE but can't be obvious about because of the whole ""kill the gays"" thing.",9
Watch Shreyas do a Galaxy brain move and bowl Ashwin in the power play despite what we just witnessed,3
It'll be exciting to see how Kohli and Chahal react to this onslaught from here on...,4
Koach means?,1
Pride Delhi is big dick Delhi,5
Virat chasing 100 is on boys,5
Sundae is just WoW!,3
good thing RCB is playing with 7 bowlers.,3
I can already feel Shaw vs Gill will be next generation's Rohit vs Kohli/Tendulkar vs Dravid debate.,8
Kohli realising he already made a mistake picking Siraj,7
When can we expect to see the LORD?,2
AB must have been a Tai Chi Shifu in his previous life,4
What level is Washington sundar playing on.,10
Sundar playing a different game than the rest of RCB here,11
They even ripped of the name taka tak for tik tok,3
"""exciting' batting lineup😒",9
Kohli's Trump card was just carted around for 18.,18
powerplay batting is back bois,6
Sundar is bhuvi in the Gayle vs Pune game,8
Not every spinner can bowl in powerplay like Washi,6
We were all worried about Siraj before the match. Now looks like he is the only hope,13
"Baby Sehwag!!!


I don't know if it's a complement or insult.",12
Sundar is OP bruh,7
Iyer bouncing the ball on his bat is oddly ominous,12
damn prithvi got no chill,12
So unlucky sundar.,9
DC are the favorites in this tournament. They got the batting lineup and two genuine fast bowlers.,10
DC is the only team this ipl who can play with 3 foreign players and be as strong,12
"Oh God noooo, such bad luck 🥺",5
Guys remember Siraj Hasn't even bowl d yet,11
Siraj hasn't even bowled yet,3
Washington’s figures usually look like he’s playing on a different pitch. Other bowlers can learn from him.,5
Damn even Washington is getting hammered! Shaw on god mode!,5
Sundar is really a great economical bowler,5
Calm down guys. Chahal can do some nice 69D setup after power play is done. The turn is also good.,6
Washington Sundar is basically a spinner Hazlewood,7
Midwicket fileder has been brilliantly placed...got the angles right,2
Best two teams so far are Delhi and Mumbai.,2
"Fucking hell man, Shaw is batting like peak Sehwag.",7
"Guys, calm down! This is actually just a par score. In Sharjah",7
Was Sachin this talented at Shaw's age  ?,0
Did DC's jersey change? What's that orange colour around the waist?,6
"the thing is, i dodnt feel like shaw is taking too many risks today. he's picking the field really well today.",3
What's par score on this ground?,3
dc got this day only to go bonkers uh,5
First RCB lite gets fucked and now...,4
Kohli might be regretting bowl first decision.,4
Sundar's bowled extremely well in the powerplay this year,5
CSK and DC really turned around their powerplay batting.,4
DC playing like champions this time. 😄,4
Bring in our main bowler Siraj already we need wickets,9
Great start by Delhi!!,3
Yeh log shaam tak khelenge toh gaand phat gaayegi- Kohli,6
I configured my set top box and TV to run off the same remote. It's not as exciting as I thought it would be. :(,2
"""George"" Washington Sundar",5
"Powerplay is the only good phase we are good at, welp.",3
We should have played umesh and siraj together since we are going full meme anyway,4
One tip one hand ka kya mallab hota hai?,1
"This power play score is highest of the season so far for Delhi.
Even more than Sharjah.
With 4 Siraj overs remaining,it's Rip RCB ಠ︵ಠ",7
"Bring on Lord Siraj to bestow his greatness, he's our only hope",2
Has the pitch changed a bit or has the bowling been poor for last two games?,2
Starting to think our batting performance in Sharjah wasn't because of the ground being small.,5
180ig,1
What does Kohli say to Siraj during time out?,1
Chahal gave more in one over than Sundar's combined in all 3,3
DC should've played finals last year rather than chennai track bully csk,2
Ana De Armas’s ad is the best ad.,4
263 breach,3
Goddammit don't tell me dubai is becoming the bowler's graveyard as well,3
Prithvi Shaw perfectly rated,15
Why did RCB choose to bowl?,11
"Whenever I see Siraj's name, I remember that he was in the squad for the 2018 Windies test series, but they decided to give Thakur a debut ahead of him. Shardul proceeded to injure himself after 4 balls or something.",8
Right back to worse than -1 nrr i Guess,5
Washington doing well against DC.... Washington DC.... Conspiracy confirmed.,87
"Credit where it’s due, Bangar is speaking better than he was in the initial matches.",3
Wheres the fuckin mankads this season come on bhenchods,9
"Bangar uses ""literally"" a lot , and most of the times it's not right .",6
Shaw definitely plays like Sehwag.,7
Imagine sehwag and shaw batting together,5
"So they have 7 bowling options with Siraj, Dube and Moenn? Is this equivalent to the CSK batting line-up in bowling?",3
"Who names their kids Washington

\-Kerry OKeefe probably",7
"Lmao reminds me of the owners match video RCB have on their YouTube.

Siddharth Mallya goes on to talk about how he's gonna post a 200+ total and goes on to win the toss and go ""we'll have a bowl""",5
Only RCB can turn Dubai into Sharjah,6
26 overs on this pitch without a wicket now,5
Shaw OP,2
The Lord is here.,7
"Rate the stadiums

1 Dubai

2 Sharjah

3 Abu Dhabi",3
Sundar is a revaluation!,3
Ponting's presence on the field still looks quite intimidating.,7
"Waiting for Shaw to hit a six off Sundar so that I can say, ""That ball reached Washington, alright.""

I'll show myself out now.",7
"Shaw, Gill, Jaiswal and Padikkal. India's not going to have a shortage in top order batsmen.",9
"Just tuned in

Are there some jersey changes for DC.?",6
Hope Pontings help changes Shaws temperament for better. He will be unstoppable,6
So it begins.....,5
Siraj is away boys.,5
Siraj into action,1
Siraj.exe installing............. please be patient,4
It starts...,2
Ah shit here we go again!,2

"DC openers were motivated to not get out until they face 4 overs of Siraj

edit: nvm lol, Siraj GOAT",2
Just joined in. And they're playing Moeen?? Maybe he's looking good in the nets cause he looked horribly out of form when he was playing for Eng recently.,3
"Gotta love that spirit from siraj. He looks so pumped up rn only to go 50 from 4 overs at the end

E: sincere apologies sire siraj",2
DC targeting 15 additional runs to make up for Misbra ji’s absence,2

It had to be Siraj. A wicket fell after exactly 27 overs at Dubai.,5
Siraj and 2020 perfect duo,1
did this sub meme siraj into form? we have too much powers,4
Who would have thought that Siraj will make the breakthrough,2
The fuck. The lad was looking really good at the crease :(,2
LORD SIRAJ LORD SIRAJ,1
Siraj is clever to hide the headband by wearing it in black..he must be following this sub closely,4
"Shit on player who you want to win you the game, win said game.
It's a simple spell, but quite unbreakable.",4
"Fucking hypocrites on here praising bowlers when they speak out against online abuse but then do the same on match threads, you lot make me sick. Bunch of keyboard warriors smh",6
"For the 5th day running, this sub has shitposted a shite player into form",6
Siraj heard r/cricket talking shit,3
One thing I seriously hate about Kohli is the send off. You don’t have to abuse a 20 year old kid when most of the folks treat you like a legend.,10
"I started following ipl seriously, this year only... what's up with fellow redditors from r/cricket being wrong quite a bit... Siraj today.",2
you know this game is incredible when siraj suddenly gets the first wicket at peak hammering session,6
Always count on kohli to be more excited than the bowler after a wicket,18
We always do this shit it’s so frustrating ffs. Losing a wicket when we’re looking so good,4
inb4 moses comes in to divide the red sea.,6
How terrible it must feel to get out to someone who goes by the name Mohammad Siraj,8

Keeps a slip for Iyer. Bowls at pads,7
Siraj haters ... where are you now?,3
Sir Shri Siraj 🙏,3
Wonderful legside dolly to get Shreyas Iyer going,9
Siraj looks determined to give an extra 15 to compensate for that wicket,9
puts a rubbish ball away and called the man in form,5
What the fuck is wrong with Kohli? Giving send off to an 20 year old. He can be so annoying.,1
Have a slip and bowl towards leg side. 4D chess from siraj.,11
Siraj taketh..siraj giveth..and repeat,11
Umesh has ads... good for him,5
"Siraj has done his job, now keep him away for the entire innings for good.",6

Ngl, like it this way.",7
I'd imagine Kohli would be excellent at Poker..,29
Delhi’s batting depth is insane,2
Shaw wanted to hit that for a 12.,6
"Shaw had no need to play that shot, 100 was his today",5
"Dhawan should hit out or get out, we want to see Pant vs Chahal",8
RCB without Washington would be giving 80+ in powerplay,34
What a fucking spell.,7
CMV:Saini has a sexy Adam's Apple ಠ_ಠ,1
Dhawan when on song is a delight to watch. I hope tonight is his night,3

Teams play Sundar like he is Murli.,7
"5 bowlers in RCB are Indian, all doing a decent job. More power to RCB.",7
Don't get why players don't target Sundar,1
"I like RCB's today's team, provides good overall balance. 

7 proper batsmen, 7 bowling options, decent pacers, 3 spinners, medium pace. 

Irrespective of the result, RCB should continue with this line up for at least 3-4 matches ( unless Morris comes in)",13
Lol,4
That was a fked up run out,2
LMAO that fielding.,5
Thanks sundar for keeping the score lower than it probably could have been,6
Looking at these figures from Sundar and to think Koach didn't use to bowl him properly earlier.,11

Punter really hasn't fucking aged at all.,11
Can hear punter speaking for ages and still not be satisfied,4
Nice bouncer,10
what a bouncer,8
What was that washi,2
Dhawan is playing a KL role and I hate it,3
Won't lie but he is bowling with some pace,17
Wow.,4
Lord siraj man is a myth,8
What would Umesh be thinking right now watching siraj bowl,12
Dhawan is our KL Rahul y'all,4
🎺Siraj bad pee poo pee poo 🎺,1

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE SIRAJ I KNEW?!,12
I can listen to Ricky Pointing talk all day,6
"Siraj going for 6 runs per over.

Wait! Is Udana the only Sri Lankan in the tournament this time???!,12
Is Dhawan getting into the territory where it is going to be counter productive? He needs to move the rate,1

"Fuck fuck fuck man, dhawan why you always do that",1
There you go. It was coming,1
"Get in Mo, simple catch.",2
"32(28), well made? Lol.",5
Well Udana is a wicket taker even though he goes for runs,4
"dear r/cricket, y’all remember last year’s match threads where, whenever that one particular guy posts on the thread, everyone would go “u/thatguyijustmentioned cracks a joke” and such? Where’s that guy? I hope he’s doing great.",2
Rcb creeping back in,3
Isuru Udana is exceeding my expectations.,4
That was such a satisfying slide at the boundary,3
Calm down guys Chahal will not bowl in the death.,3
Potentially match losing knock from Dhawan in a high scoring contest,5
Padikkal should be fast tracked into the t20. He should open along with Rohit,3
"Yes!!

Sees Pant coming in

No",7
Lmao that screeming after wicket,1
RCB actually came back good in the last 4 overs,2
People had such hopes for Dhawan in 2019 cwc lol.,-3
RCB has pulled back nicely in the last 4 overs.,5
I think it’s time to start praying that RCB use Moeen correctly (as a middle overs pinch hitter against spin) and not as a finisher,3
"Fuck me, how the hell did Watson and Faf put on that unbeaten partnership yday?",5
Shreyas - Pant partnership incoming,1
"rCb boSsinG the bOwlinG

*bro Run rate is 8.5 already*",3
"Really good bowling attack for RCB, we have every other option this season.

Speed : Saini , Udana , Siraj
Spin : Chahal , Zampa , Moin Ali 
Slow : Dube, Sundar 

Bowler availible for every pitch",3
Dhawan saw that they show number of 30+ scores . That's why he scores just above 30 and gets out. *Stretigist*,6
As neutral viewer I want RCB to win today.,9
"Dhawan isn't a T20 opener!!

His SR is atrocious.",5
Dhawan or KL,2
Kolhi has surprisingly made good bowling changes in this match.,4
"Iyer-Pant partnership, count me in birches",3
"RCB bowling is fighting back, what is this???",2
Imagine spending your time watching a cricket game just to comment on how a 20 yr old who's already achieved more than you has a shit hairline or facial hair,7
Delhi have lost all the momentum they had in the power play.,1
"RCB must be kicking themselves for getting Dhawan out, DD’s run-rate can now improve",8
"Drop Dhawan for two matches and play him again, he will play with more intent.",6
Man hope iyer can steer the innings to momentum,1
"drop dhawan, get rahane?",6
Now pant will sacrifice his wicket for Kohli to make it into international team.,3
Why is Dc full of Chonky boys,9
Shikhar Dhawan is the new Parthiv Patel of IPL. 25-35 every game and then chill.,22
"Hotstar is fuckin infuriating, hate everything about it. Fuck Disney",10
holy shit that RCB chant is so cringe,6
Inb4 Pant lobs an easy catch at third man deep again.,4
Iyer is overrated vs pace,4
Rcb have pulled it back well,5
I'm sensing Iyer wicket soon. Chahal might get it,3
Pant striking already at 200... class /s,9
I hope Pant plays his natural game,3
"Gurkeerat Singh? It's like Kohli's playing Dream11 with his side, with this budget pick.",3
Can someone tell why DC’s jersey changed suddenly,7
Udana picking up wickets every game it seems like.,14
What’s the point to these chants ? There’s literally nobody there,6
Iyer takes time to settle down. Finish off spinners now,6
Fuck Facebook and their stupid ads,7
Just tuned in. What’s with the LGBTQ+ pride jersey of DC today? Are they doing some charity today ?,9
"Does anyone know what the ""Owaweyo"" is in the RCB theme song?",3
Why's an umpire there with a lemonade stand?,3
That DC support staff looks like bilbo Baggins played by Martin freeman,2
PANT SHAW HETTY ALL FAT,3
I like Dhawan in ODI but his T20 strike rate is not good enough for an opener.,5
Now this is the over,1
Delhi is playing with a new jersey? I can see more colors today,2
Pant looks like he ate his twin brother.,8
Whats up with rainbow stripes on DC uniform?,3
Now getting either Pant or Iyer out will ensure a low score for DC,14
Excellent comeback by the bowlers,17
Will Pant cross 35 today?,9
Shreyas face when a spinner comes on is just as same as Rohit face when he sees a vadapav,19
Udana may go for runs but he manages to get a wicket or two every match,16
Incoming: Delhi collapse? I'm always so nervous.,2
How much are iyer pant and shaw paid,-1
Guys start making jokes. There's been a relative lack of jokes on this thread,3
Just started to watch today's match -- the DC jersey is straight up fire. Where do I buy one?,5
"New Delhi jersey is because of the new partnership with JSW Paints, just for the benefit of people repeatedly asking about it",22
PC crowd in full force in the thread,1
"Why does Delhi always play like shit when I tune in?
They were probably a lot better in the first 8 overs",6
Catch virat.,2
need atleast 180 here,2
Idk if Udana is suited for the new ball,3
"This is PANT's night, I can feel it in my JEANS. ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )",4
"India's Capital - New Delhi

DC's slogan - 'Yeh hai Nayi Dilli'

"**Match-up**

**Chahal vs Iyer**: 63 runs from 39 balls so far, 0 dismissals, 163 SR

**Chahal vs Pant**: 45 runs from 31 balls so far, 1 dismissal, 145 SR",3
"After seeing Siraj's opening spell.  
Chinnaswamy Stadium: are we the baddies?",8
"Whomever had said that RCB will be shit the first hour because he/she can’t watch the match until then, but will do great after that, bravo. 👏🏻",1
Did DC changed the jersey for the rest of the season or for only today's match,3
"Found this information in  internet -

""The JSW Group has played a crucial role in the development of Indian sports over the last few years. Our team will proudly don the JSW Paints jersey for the game against RCB not only in support of the group's tremendous contribution towards Indian sports, but also to endorse the message of unity,"" said Dhiraj Malhotra, CEO of Delhi Capitals.",8
Is this DC's jersey for the rest of the season?,2
Great over by Yuzi.,2
Come-on pant. Try and smash one,3
Shaw's hairline makes me feel sad,8
Catch it biscuit,1
Does Brohit resemble Emran Hashmi in the D11 ad?,4

"After yesterday's chase, 200 seems needed to win.",1
Who has Moeen replaced in the team?,1
It's Ali vs Iyer. Somethings going to happen,7
woa everyone making solid comebacks ever since siraj took wicket,4
stoked to see moeen bowl ngl,5
"Come on Mo, hopefully get some wickets here!",4
Kohli now has a lot of options with bowling,1
Moeen Ali is such an underrated player economy of 6.9 batting strike rate of 160 over last 2 seasons.,6
Moeen with a godly ER,1
Pant & Iyer is my new favourite power couple,2
"Iyer licking his lips.

Edit: Spoke too soon.",1

Paddikal can do nothing wrong,18
PogU,4
I hate it here!,6
Fucking hell,5
PADDIKKKAAALLLLLLL,10
I absolutely did not expect RCBoyz to boss DC like this.,11
my mannnnn,5
[deleted],8
"ABSOLUTE BEAUTY! What a fuckin grab that is, take a bow.",7
Jeez. That was classy,6
Oh devdutt. The reach!!,4
Moeen Bhai > Zampa,12
Padikkal 😍😍,10
Future captain of Rcb takes the catch,11
"Lmao screeming continues, ig it was Koach",9
What a catch from Padikkal holy shit,12
Ahhhhhhh fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck no iyer what have you done,7
Delhi Kohlapse,6
SO FUCKING EXCITEDDDDDDDDDDTO SEE HETTY AND PANT BAT TOGETHER,8
So I just checked DC's socials and the colors on the jerseys has something to do with their embrace every color campaign or something. Hope that answers the question.,6
So Dube isn't gonna bowl anymore??,4
What a catch! Also a wicket for Mo!,10
FFS Shreyas 🙁 great catch though,3
Moeen and siraj both taking wicket in the first over,7
Somehow watching these kinda catches at the ropes ain't that exciting anymore. Still a good effort.,29
"**11.3** Ali to Iyer, OUT, Paddikal takes a superb catch at deep midwicket **90-3**

SS Iyer c Padikkal b Ali 11 (13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 84.61",4
Devduttt mannn that boyyy,8
Iyer has been playing in Sharjah for too long,4
This Padikkal kid is having some IPL..,16
"Where's the ""Woulda been a Six @ Sharjah™"" gang ?",21
Padikkal Raja!,5
Padikkal u legend!!!!!!!,10
That was almost a 6 ..he almost lost balance and was about to drop the ball,3
They make those catches look so easy nowadays,10
No boundaries in the last 3 overs and a wicket. RCB taking control.,10
Ok Padikkal.. I'm a fan now..what a catch,11
DEV YOU BEAUTUFIL CREATURE,16
Rcb with a great comeback sheeesshh,7
RCB bossing the IPL. 2020 in a nutshell,5
Iyer with the Sharjah hangover.,8
That's why an innings in Sharjah shouldn't be a marker that the man is back in form.,4
Good thing were playing RCB theres a chance for Hetmyer to continue their curse and perform against them lol,9
Send in Stoinis,2
YES MO NICE MO,11
What a catch.,8
He hit that to the longest side of ground 82m,5
"Ladies, find a guy who holds on to you like DP held on to that ball.",3
Hetmayer is gonna save us tonight.,2
"Dugout : sucking out Iyer for that shot 

Padikkal: O B S E R V E",28
3 wickets in 5 overs! What a comeback by RCB,7
Paddikal I love you,9
FFS MADHARCHOD STOINIS,6
Devdutt is so calm all the time,15
Ah man,2
I'm so impressed with Dev Paddikal; looks to have a great temperament in addition to obvious cricketing talent.,12
"Machas we are not dreaming, RCB do have the best bowling line up this season",7
ದೇವದತ್ತ ~~ಪಡಿಕ್ಕಲ್~~ ಹಿಡಿಯಲ್,9
sakath nam hudga :-),5
So many catches where the fielder hops over the boundary recently that they’re almost unremarkable now when even 5 seasons ago it would be one of the catches of the season,3
"Why did we send Stoinis with 2 overs of Chahal to go FFS, easy wicket for him",2
"With that catch, Paddikal's ""Moochwalon Ka Yuvraj Singh"" status is confirmed.",5
"This kid Prithvi Shaw, India should back him for a long period of time",4
The guy doesn’t leave any moment to impress.,5
Again a bowling change gets a wicket. This is brilliant captaincy from Virat today.,9
Lol! Koach is spoiled with the bowling options available.,7
"Good move to bring stoinis in, he needs some time to get in",6
You'd have to say RCB favored to win now,1
ShReYas is a great player of spin though,14
What's the point of hetmyer if stoinis comes above him?,9
RCB looking stronger match by match.,5
RCB has meme'd themselves back into 2020,6
Next bowler: ABD,3
The last few overs have been a good choke by RCB. DC have been derailed here and really need a partnership of some sort to get them going to a decent target.,3
"share your views about this one , RCB fan, but should that really be given out?

Ball went out of bounds, even if in air

Rules are rules, bur I dont feel too good about such dismissal.",-4
Stoinis is either gonna go berserk or gonna get out at 11. Hetmyer is gonna get caught after hitting one six in 7 balls.,3
I still can't fathom Finch is left handed,4
Hope ex rcb curse doesn't strike again,4
"Finch throws with left hand, bats with right?!",6
Hetty should bat at 3 ffs. Insane batting talent wasted for spin bully idli,6
I wish my bank balance was as good as Padikkal there!!!,2
It’s confirmed guys.. RCB has been trash because of Chinnaswamy.,12
Nicely pulled back by RCB. They are different this year.,4
Is finch chonky or chubby?,3
"I just read on Twitter that the colourful jersey is celebrating a sponsorship deal with JSWPaints. It celebrates the diversity in India under hashtag EmbraceEveryColour.  Personally I miss Captain Morgan Rum dancing for RBC, but we are where we are.",2
I don’t get why they send Hetmyer at 4 down. He is a very good player and can play a huge innings if settles in.,1
Kohli's face after that wicket lol,9
Is there an 'Ex-RCB vs RCB'™ innings in store today?,4
The stripes on the shoulder remind me of Pune Warriors and Germany 🇩🇪,3
"See so many of these catches these days. In the olden days, the fielder wouldn't have bothered or helped it over the boundary for a six.",5
[deleted],2
I don't trust Pant....,5
RCB is dead. Long live RCB!,12
Everything just clicking for RCB! Feels good,5
120 all out I’m calling it,1

Damn Delhi got batdeep,5
[removed],-18
after siraj's introduction boundaries have dried up.,9
ANNA Chahal!!!!!,2
"stoinis, please. mate",2
really hope Stoinis somehow survives Chahal this over,5
"if DC lose this match, would they go back to their old jersey?",4
That ball would go in the hardware store opposite the sharjah ground.,6
Isn't Hetmyer more of an anchor than a pinch hitter?,1
That was really difficult,5
Stoinis vs RCB hehehe,9
I hope Delhi gets to 170 somehow,6
That smile from chahal,5
Ground's so big today,3
Chahal gets so many opportunities like that he should always be ready for a ball coming at him especially at the beginning of batsman's inning,5
Nice shot,3
"DC got Harshal Patel today, how is he with the bat",4
Chahal is that thin kid in school everyone thinks they can walk over ...but end up regretting messing with him,15
"kohli be cursing chahal's height on that ball.

more bournvita now",11
"DC playing with the Pride flag colors

Stoinis and Zampa get to meet up

Hmmm",20
"I like this approach by rcb this year .Whether or not they can go far remains to be seen

Giving a chance to youngsters and having confidence in players. Putting paddikal as opener, bowling sundar in pp, persisting with siraj , trying to have a core team without making too many changes and not relying too much on kohli and abd as before",8
"If Chahal were to be given an honorary Kannada name, what would it be?",7
"Great pullback by RCB, but they’re still going to make 180",8
Siraj bowling well for RCB? 2020 is truly cursed,10
Gotta be impressed with Kohli's aggression,0
Stoinis muscles gonna come handy in this big ground to clear the ropes,10
DC jersey is not as bad as people on Twitter are saying it is. Liked it actually,5
"Padikkal’s brand value is going to skyrocket. His batting aside, he’s already amassing a good fan following on Twitter. The girls are all over him. He’s definitely not a bad looking guy. He’s going to be in several endorsements soon enough. This guy better be retained for several seasons.",64
"The other day after Padikkal scored his 3rd fifty, a guy of Twitter suggested that Iyer should be dropped from the Indian team, Padikkal can open with KL Rahul dropping down to No. 4. 

I was like WTF lmao

Not at all gatekeeping but i hate these casual fans so much who give opinions with no facts whatsoever",39
Grounding the feet on the field of play after going outside the boundary is already in the law right? Not sure if it's still being debated like Styris and Swann are discussing in the dugout.,3
When Panty hits a boundary he puts the strength of all his existence behind those shots.,15
Nokia with 200 SR,9
"Nah don't come forward to chahal.

He's gonna kill you",13
Am I the only one who heard that gasp?,9
I don't think we'll restrict them to under 170,6
Man stonis is playing dangerously,2
KP so biased for Delhi tho,7
Every time Chahal dives I feel for his bones.,60
I think Yuzi needs to do C&B practice and he can easily take 3 wickets per game.,10
Both Chonky boys at the crease.,5
why does Dc kit have german flag on it,4
"increase the meme count, COLLAPSE INCOMING",3
DC got a really fickle batting line up. Gonna be interesting how this plays out,3
That takatak ad is so irritating.,4
Love the aggression from Kohli today except bowling chahal in the pp,9
"I am supporting both DC and RCB this season and a DC vs RCB final would be a dream come true for me.

But today I am hoping that RCB wins. DC looks really strong and has potential to qualify even if some wins are needed in their last few matches. But no such confidence in RCB and want them to qualify as soon as possible.",15
"I hope people like Matthews stayed in shape during this time, dudes about to get injured every other game if he became a chonky boy again.",3
This is a good opportunity for Stoinis to build some sort of innings and explode in the end.,6
FUCKER POINIS,9
"Moeen, it's time to disappear now.  Stoinks time",3
Simon Doull’s team is shitty,5
HULK SMASH,5
Iyer:- that's longer,9
As soon as he bowled that I knew that ball was travelling,3
Don’t bowl short to Stoin,3
Stoinis pls end with a well fought 10(25),6
You madlad stoinis,2
Here's to hoping RCB play their natural game for the last 5 overs of bowling.,3
Should have bowled slightly shorter than that. Would have left the stadium,3
Doull doesn't have faf in his team wot,3
WHat's wrong with Big Marcus? Holy moly!,2
"No one, AB : CaTcH iT",15
I audibly cringed at that Sunny,6

That was just pure strength from the wrists,1

Stoinis you sexy dadddyyyy!!!,2
"DC is one hell of an entertaining team, you always feel something is going to go wrong for them",7
Wtf is pingopingo,4

Stoinis not playing brain dead shots against spin? 2020 is truly something else,7

Morgs forgot to tell Kohli that you're only supposed to bowl Mo for one over in T20s,10
Chintu’s parents are Rosa Diaz and Mayank Agarwal,11
Does anyone think that Stoinis is deliberately trying to use his wrists more than usual? I think a lot of his problems rotating the strike when he plays for Australia is his hard hands and inability to manipulate the ball. He looks like he's trying very hard to rectify this against the spinners this IPL.,8
"Scotty: All in one.

Stoinis the traitor continuing the tradition of EX RCB players smashing RCB,52
Both Delhi and Sunrisers are struggling with injuries this season.,7
C’mon rcb don’t get complacent and let them get to a big total. They should still go with an attacking mindset and not bowl to save runs,2

Saini couldn't look him in the eyes.,5
Dafuq RCB. Death overs start from the 16th,3
"Poor Finch, probably wondering why Stoinis can't do this for him",9
"Saini is going to the cleaners today, pressure beamer is here in the 15th over already LOL",6
Stoinis angry they didn't let him bat to Zampa,6
God I love the talent packed team that Delhi has. We have had this in bits and pieces but We are finally seeing a gelled product.,2
Is a beamer per match minimum for RCB?,9
Oh no,2
"Saini: look at me, LOOK AT ME!!!


I'm the siraj",6
"""Accident""",3
Indian Beamer League,3
Pls stoinis enough from over already,2
Now this is the Saini we know,2
The only way RCB could have stopped Stoinis is by playing Zampa. They missed the trick here.,14
What a terrible over from Saini,3
Saini is a dick. Every game.,7
"Dude saini 2nd time in consecutive game, not good stuff",6
Broken fuken arm,3
yoo these jerseys are a beauty. Where can I buy me a Stoinis one?,3
Saini and Siraj - roles reversed today.,4
Coming of age wtf commentary is going on in Dugout.,2
Saini here playing baseball,1
Saini didn't apologize? No?,6
Saini should be really careful with those.. damn,8
Showing Mishra as soon as Stoin struck on the finger? Wow,3
"Lol, the ball “slipped” out of the hand again.",16
Lmao and you were worried about Siraj,6
"If you can't get them out, kill them.",13
Only way to get stoinis,5
Saini always bowls beamer when under pressure.,7
Cameraman trying not to zoom on Stoinis' ass,7
Is this patch really batting friendly or were KXIP just over cautious yesterday?,2
"Stoin saying ""**you couldn't even say sorry?**"" after the beamer, seems to have hurt him a bit

feelsbadman.jpg",15
ah the chin diapers,5
Hope stoinis is okay,3
Where's the Dugout score board ?,1
Thank God it's his non bowling arm,2
"Sainis 2nd time , he probably will be fined",9
Moron Saini,8
That would have killed me!,8
"140 KM/H beamer on the fingers.

Ouch.",10
Stoinis angry because RCB dropped Zampa,14
"Swann slating united , I love it",2
"Stonis be like so you finished your 5th bowler quota.

Imma take your best bowler apart.",8
"If any team wants to stand a chance to beat RCB, all they need to do is get an Ex RCB player on their team.",5
Welcome to another day of rcb getting thrashed by an ex-rcb player,6
Damn they wore this jersey to celebrate Stoinis and Zampa's relationship. We got it wrong all this time!,8
RCB shouldn't have let go of stoinis after just one year.,3
Saini is straight up not having a good day so far.,5
"also Stoinis is so YOKED, dude is absolutely shredded",5
"This happening too often now Mr, Saini",13
Would have loved to see zampa vs stoinis,1
9D chess by Saini to stop Stoinis,9
Saini goes to kill the batsman when he starts to get hit. First Lord Tewatia who cannot be killed then Greek God Stoinis who also cannot be killed.,15
Saini removes mask to reveal it was Siraj. Siraj removes mask to reveal it's Saini.,10
"Gee I hope stoinis does not get injured , that was nasty from Saini... bowling a beamer to unsettle a batsman , cheap old tactics",10
He didn't even apologize ffs,18
Fuck this. Rcb can't chase above 170 against rabada and nortje. This game is done,5
"If Kohli could bowl fast, he’d be Saini.",9
Iyer looks like he's about to cry,3
Rip our nrr this match,1
Wait why aren't they showing the next ball?,1
"Saini is like *tune mujhe mara, maine tujhe mara, hisaab barabar*",7
Please..we can’t lose stoinis.,4
This match is a rare chance for RCB to be at the top of the table,1
"Stoinis is going to be the new Watson boys, I said it first",2
🏳️‍🌈 Go DC Go !! 🏳️‍🌈,0
Is Sunil Gavaskar trying to allege that Saini meant to bowl a beamer? I don't get what other context that statement could have.,4
"It DID slip, wtf is Sunny on about? Is he insinuating Saini intentionally bowled a beamer?",5
"Is Saini the new Shoaib Akhtar? That's the second time I've seen him bowl a beamer at a batsman that was hitting him out the park within the week.,...",7
Iyer looks like he's crying,3
Stoin injured o wot?,1
"Navdeep ""Beeaking fuckin arms"" Saini",8
How many of our players are going to die!,4
"We need to watch out this Saini guy, did the same against Tewatia last game. Almost killed him. Like seriously?",8
"Stoinis hitting boundaries
Virta to bowlers: what if we used 100% of the brain?",3
"STFU gavaskar, he didn’t do it purposely. “No way that slipped”, are you insane, you think Saini wants to give away a free hit?!",12
Making a habit of this old Navdeep,1
Is Sunny saying Saini did this on purpose?,9
That should cost at least 2 free hits !!,6
"Can't bat if no fingers are left 


*Lord Saini*",5
Saala Indian Travis Friend,0
Did saini apologise?,5
Sunny G mincing no words. Saying it was deliberate,20
Hulk is angry,3
Saini bowls a good ball on the Free hit ball lol,2
I do find it strange that the punishment for stepping an inch over the crease when bowling is the same as bowling a potentially dangerous waist or higher full toss.,7
Is dangerous bowler ki le lo. Teach him a lesson,6
That was a wide if he didn't hit it,1
That's a way to reply You madlad stoinis,3
Yo what the hell is Sunil Gavaskar on about? Why is he questioning Navdeep Saini's intentions when he bowled that no ball?,10
Stoinis- Fuck of saini khaini,4
DC at this moment taking advantage of RCB not fielding Steven Finn everywhere.,1
Chahal wtf,2
Sunny G going all in.,2
Saini seems like an asshole,4
Ooohh boy that slo mo,2
Nam devru,2
Hulk is angry 😡😡😡,5
 Another Lord created by rcb,4
[removed],5
Kohli will kill him,9
classic RCB,3
Woof Chahal is going to get it from Kohli tonight,3
"While going through his predictions, Scotty took the name of every single team and gave them a position that he thinks they'll end up in or around.

Punjab is so low and hopeless, he didn't even take their name or wasted the energy by saying ""and Punjab will stay where they are, at the bottom of the table"".

Hurts.",5
thank fuck yuzi thank you,3
Chahal gonna get the Birthday bash for Sundar today .,2
RCB fielding,2
LMFAOOO,2
Now say sorry saini,9
"Geez, Chahal couldn't even touch the ball coming straight to him.",3
Kohli can't say much....can he..can't throw an agry fit now,8
"Get this 145 kmph beamer bowling dude out of the attack. If this was a less competent batsman or if he didn't see the ball, something horrible could happen very fast.",2
Zampa owes Chahal one,2
Come on man,3
Dafaq was that,3
Chahal simping for Stoinis,5
Peak RCB,1
Stoinis is fuming here,4
What an incredibly RCB over,4
Wow Stoinis is mad MAD at saini for not apologising,12
It's shameful that he didn't even say sorry.,8
Pant taking Chahal to the cleaners this over LETS GOOOOO,2
Lulz.,1
Stoinis is pissed,6
"LOL.

Good guy Chahal mad that Saini didn't apologize..",2
Chahal is getting 9inch long tonight,7
Stoinis dont kill,5
What happened with Stoinis? He got injured? Why’s he this pissed at the bowler?,3
Saini is the first RCB Lord today. Grats dude.,4
"Hulk angry,hulk smash",5
Kohli's gonna murder Chahal tonight with that face,3
Stoinis is gonna kill saini. Not sure if it happens before Saini killing chahal,9
Oh come on,1
Everything improved but not fielding,2
Great catching by Chahal /s,2
"Saini needs to control his anger, no match is worth someone's life",2
No one misses with nonchalant stoinis,1
"Chahal on his bowling is that muscled dog meme, on other bowling he's that doggo crying",1
How do these motherfuking chooths drop these laddu catches every single game??,4
I think umpires have discretion to enforce a harsher punishment than a no ball if they can conclude that a Beamer was bowled deliberately.,2
Shreyas always controlling his tears,5
Don’t try to kill the batsman if you bowl shit.,7
Thanks .. apologies accepted for the beamer.,3
Rip RCB,2
Did we meme RCB's good run too much and push them back into form? 😐,5
"Stoinis is livid .. rightly so...
Doesn't look like Saini said sorry , atleast his futile gesture doesn't suggest he meant an apology.",6
Sunny's 'brilliant fielder' just dropped a catch,7
I feel like I see myself in Saini here. Not that I bowl 145 clicks. But that I normally want to bodyline if I get hit. Not a good thing lol.,6
shit Feilding by RCB contineous,2
"Karma's a bitch they said, take that Saini",3
"Saini at-least apologize - no point in being a D\*\*\*. Learn from AB, he was your ex-teammate.",9
1 drop this match is better than the multiple drops every other match,2
You gotta take those like ffs man,3
32 runs in last 2 overs.,4
[deleted],6
"saini's second beamer, bowled one to tewatia too that day. Seems premeditated",8
"Why is Chahal even kept at the boundary? 

He has small hands, poor fielder",10
"Sunny ji a few overs earlier - ""Chahal is a great fielder"". 

Weed had just started kicking in.",6
Stoinis unleashing his anger on RCB for dropping his mate Zampa from the playing XI,2
"Everytime Chahal fields now,I am gonna be reminded of Sunny G's comment.That should have been taken.Chahal bc.",9
Classic rcb,3
Ball is IPL trophy,5
Kohli should chastise Chahal for the drop by asking to bowl the 16th over.,4
WTF was that Chahal,3
"My god. Stonis's face. He was very angry, that's what Glenn Mcg used to do.",10
Somebody's gonna get a hurt real bad...,4
First Nehra and now Gavaskar. Why do these commentators not like Saini? Only a dickhead like Akhtar intentionally bowls beamer and he (Akhtar) apologized afterwards.,5
"Love stoins, but let's not be precious...",5
Stoin would have hulk smashed Saini if he got out that ball,7
Chahal fucked up,4
Always loved stoinis after his 146* vs nzl,3
Chahal,3
This is why you don’t let chess players play cricket,12
Stoinis not amused here,5
Siraj gonna face the wrath,2
"Sit tight everyone, Siraj at the death",2
Hulked up,3
Stoinis is motivated by pure anger rn,7
Siani should be really careful. He hit Tewatia the other night on his collarbone. He wil soon injure someone seriously,9
Chahal needs to get Cottrell to be his bodyguard today,3
Stoinis gonna make a century today. I can sense it.,3
"You always see Stoinis smiling, so you never really see how scary he looks when he gets angry lol",8
Stoinis in other worldly form. What a hit through covers LETS GOOO,3
You madlad stoinis,3
Saini needs to be banned for a game or two a injury to Stoinis could have derailed DC’s tournament,8
Big Brain Siraj: What if I bowl a pie?,5
Oh how I have missed this since Starc vs Pollard years ago.,6
Siraj is back bois...,1
One of the few times i want an Australian to belt Indian bowlers,7
Saini being toxic there by not apologizing to Stoinis. That didn't look like a slip and seemed very deliberate. Asshole,5
Siraj back to form,2
My mans abt to cry,5
"Gotta say sorry now Saini, else the Hulk is gonna single handedly smash every bowler.",2
"Stoin mad, Stoin smash",4
Stonis knew the ball will come there 2 days ago only,1
"Firstly, Fuck Saini for that shit and he was a massive cunt for not apologising immediately. 

Also, Chahal has been awful in the field this season. Third dropped catch IIRC.",6
"Why is iyer so sad, who stole his candy?",4
This chutiya never performed like this when playing for RCB......,1
Easily 70 runs in 5,2
Madlad nonchalant stoinis,1
Angry Stoinks > Angry Koach ?,2
Damn Stoinis you sexy beast!!,1
Looks like Saini did wake up the Hulk in Stoinis. Warne must be erect.,3
Stoinis: *You wouldn't like me when I'm angry*,2
Yuzi dropping Stoinis will have serious consequences,1
99.9 is only good when its ur CAT percentile,3
Stonis don't give a fuck if it was wide.,1
What's the record for the fastest 50 ?,1
"Both Kohli and Finchy looking visibly confused how Stoinis is doing all this, when he'd be defending half these balls for RCB and Australia",93
Yikes yikes yikes Stoinis is angry. I think made even more so by Saini.,2
So Langer loves Stoinis but Stoinis love Punter. Fair enough,3
Chad T20 league Stoinis vs Virgin LOI Stoinis,2
Warnie must be having a wank in the rr hotel rn,6
Never seen Stoinis showing so much of intent.,4
Why would you make Hulk angry? Saini fucked up big time.,3
here we go again,2
Stoinis is pissed hes about to score 200,7
Chahal and drop catches.,3
[deleted],0
What an ass for not apologizing,37
11 dropped catches. FFS.,9
Honestly Saini should have apologised,19
"I flinch every time Chahal has to catch a ball well hit.

Not because he's a particularly poor fielder but his hands (and the rest of him) are so bony! Dude's got no cushion to soften the ball's impact at all.",13
"Ponting to Stoninis: Mate this is the same team which threw you out after 1 season, where you werent even bad - you wanna show them what you got?

Stoninis: 💪🏻",13
11 catches dropped out of 18 for rcb. That tells you everything.,9
[deleted],13
I am actually in love with Stoinis right now,8
ROYAL CATCHDROPPER BANGALORE :(,5
Kohli always angry,6
Why didn't kohli bowl out Siraj earlier when he was on fire?,1
Hahaha.. Saini was shitting himself as Stoinis was coming.,7
"KP, I don’t think it’s cuz of something Ponting said",3
Cold one Marcus,2
Gavaskar : chahal is a gOoD fIeLdeR,3
Man stoinis is nonchalant guy,3
Rabada do your thing time to rough up this moron,3
Commentators and armchair experts are such bitches. They hate DC.,0
F I dropped stoinis from my fantasy team 15 mins before the game,7
Stoinis is in the zone,2
Tf is wrong with Saini,6
Siraj is Umesh Yadav max pro,2
Pant is dragging. If he opens up 200 easily achievable,6
If RCB fair play still stays avg. 10 then we will know it's a fraud,9
Siraj is bowling better than Saini,11
Once you leave RCB you go down as a legend,10
"What a shitty fielder is Chahal, should be subbed for a better fielder immediately after his spell.",2
"empty the dugouts, let’s have a fight",3
Pant is chilling today with his ODI batting,3
"Out of the loop, just tuned in, why does Saini need to apologize to Stoinis?",4
Chahal why would you drop that now I'm scared,5
Ever since WC pant has forgotten how to hit boundaries,-1
We're fucked aren't we?,4
Saini deserved all of that. This was shitty.,3
Navdeep 'Jofra Archer' Saini,2
Maids in Shane Warne's hotel room are going to have a lot of cleaning up to do after this Stoinis innings.,12
How many Australian bowlers have apologized after bowling beamers,4
Man just love watching stoinis bat,2
"Bruh what’s wrong with Saini, he wants to die or what, just look at those guns which Stoinis has, man could bench bench press the guy",5
[Stoin right now](https://youtu.be/rmy34-UvhvM),3
Stoinis giving Homelander vibes,2
Sensing 200 here,1
PAPA STOINIS GOING AT IT 💦,3
Is siraj the best bowler today for rcb.?,2
Baap chod do (This is a feminist abuse created to smash patriarchy),5
sorry i missed this. what happened between stoinman and saini? or was it pant and saini?,3
Play like this for Australia you coward.,4
Stoinis to RCB :::: ***this is for Zampaaaaa***,4
Udana is gonna get massacred isn’t he,2
Stoinis playing some really smart cricket here. Highly impressed with these innings.,3
"Saini: good bowler, shitty attitude. 

Did the same with Rashid and Tewatia (though he did apologise to him).",2
People calling that beamer intentional have no idea what they’re talking about. No bowler would intentionally give away a free hit and risk being taken off the attack.,2
Don't make Stoinis angry; good mate Zampa won't be happy,5
How do these hindi commentators bring dhoni in every sentence they speak?,5
They was embarrassing bowling followed by dreadful sportsmanship from Saini.,6
Mr nags should troll chahal till the end of time for that drop.,4
Perhaps pant should also get out fast so that hetmyer and Stoinis can get revenge in their former team,2
10 an over from Siraj...I'll take it at this point...this over has gone for less,1
Who says Pant isn't a good replacement for Dhoni? (only trying to meme him into form),3
Not gonna lie I kinda enjoyed watching Indian fast bowler bowling beamer. Ofc u don't want anybody to get injured but boy this reminds me of Shoaib Akhtar when I was a kid and hoping one day to have a threatening bowler like him,1
Commentator calling Stoinis a big boy is an understatement,1
I think Dube will need to bowl an over or two today,3
"Man that gum is being chewed angrily

Pls destroy Saini. You have my blessing mr. Coffee afficinado",5
pant is not getting the timing at all,2
should have brought on Chahal after that saini over,2
Saini bowling too many full tosses and beamers now,1
Warnie's locked himself in his hotel room listening to spotify non stop since Stonis came to bat.,9
"Oh ffs, it's cricket, getting hit with a ball is an evident risk that comes with the job title. 

Even Archer didn't apologise after one of the times he hit smith during the ashes... made for great television!",10
"Dube could have been bowled atleast one over today.

Ground is bigger, would have suited him",3
What if zampa bowled to stoinis?,2
"Intentional or not, still shitty to not apologize",10
Marcus Stoinis.... Sirf naam hi kafi hai.,3
big over!!!,1
Mann Ashish Nehra is the biggest Dhoni fanboy -_-,1
"Bhuvneshwar ruled out of ipl ❌
................ Bhuvneshwar playing with Siraj mask ✅",5
Saini vs Stoinis has turned up into a small rivalry,3
hulk.. smash..,2
Why is saini back lol,1
Not sure how you are supposed to catch if you just see bright lights everywhere when you look up. I'd be interested in seeing the fielder's perspective for these grounds - as someone who's never played under floodlights. Maybe a camera angle from the ground up during timeouts.,5
Just Saini things,2
Ahhh man the drama,2
Rabada to bowl a beamer to Koach!,4
Fuck again a high full toss. Fuck Saini,3
Saini bowling his third over now what,1
"What tf is r/cricket on about Saini apologizing? 
Did you see his expression after the beamer. It was as if he was too embarrassed to face Stoinis. 
Also Gavaskar is a self certified c*nt.",8
Fuck this Stoinis. Another ex KXIP playing so well,8
That was another nearly waist high full toss,4
"Another borderline full toss/beamer


The fuck is wrong.?",20
"Knowing how cricket is, Saini is going to have a redemption thread here by picking up a few quick wickets.",4
"Team Stoinis. 

Smash him!",1
Ok can someone tell me what happened between stoinis and saini,1
"All positive thoughts I had about saini are now gone.

That kind of delivery can really hurt someone, as a basic human being you should feel concern by default.",9
"Wait this over will be interesting..

*grabs popcorn*",6
"The universe equalized that karma immediately, so all good i guess. Saini got to watch chahal drop a kiddie catch",3
Are you kidding me? Again? That was not that high. But this also slipped out?,2
It’s obvious Saini is after the slow full toss,3
Love the tension and drama,1
That was a bit high too! Wtf Saini!!,1
"Yeah Saini is going to get taken off the attack by the umpires if he keeps bowling like this.  

Good Kohli's gone to him immediately.",2
Pant must have been getting advice from Dhoni.,3
Obviously it was not intentional but poor to not apologize,4
Cmon Marcus... hit this cheat out for a maximum,1
Saini now just wants to wreck Stoin's hand,5
"In the middle of Stonis' knock and Saini's beamers, Pant is 14(15)",3
Umpire will probably award RCB 11 fair play points for that Saini beamer.,6
Chahal giving Saini advice after dropping catch lol,2
What's up with yellow shoes?,2
"Leave RCB, make merry. Same story for almost every  ex player. Ffs :'(",3
Why does Brian Lara look fit as fuck? Isn’t he like 400 years old?,4
"Kohli like ""Gand phad de uski""",5
When you need an aggressive Virat Kohli to calm you...things aren't right,9
"Serious question: suppose you had the fattest, laziest, most unfit person who can’t hold a bat neither can run nor field. However, he can spin the ball like magic and can bamboozle any batsman with his variations. How much would his lack of fitness hold back his selection if he’s an outstanding spinner?",6
You can bet Warney is stuck to his tv and wanking furiously.,12
Saini is such a trundler in the death.,5
Someone bring Zampa out to sing Stoinis the Hulk a lullaby.,16
Fucking hell Saini,6
There must be dew. No way Saini is still bowling straight up full tosses again.,6
Is there due on the outfield? No other reason he could be bowling those awkward full tosses.,4
Full tosses at 145+ are so difficult to hit,3
"Kohli vs ponting, indvsaus test series would have been such fire. Aggression against aggression",6
stoinis disappoints for rcb and then plays like god himself has come back to life the first time he plays against rcb,5
Stoinis clearly loves this ground,3
Shithouse. Just shithouse.,5
Saini need to be dropped and taught some manners first,5
Lmao Stoinis bullying saini,6
"Saini ma boy, focus on yorkers",5
You madlad stoinis,4
225 incoming....,2
the first one was bad but now r/cricket doesn’t want saini bowling full tosses at all lmao,3
"""Stoinis has been fantastic""

""So has that, the Altroz""

Really smooth stuff there, very natural",12
"Stoinis is *killing* right now, fuck",4
"Stoinis on a mission, Decimate Saini",4
"Stoinis is on absolute song here. Picking up gaps, running the doubles...",2
Another Ajinkya Rahane clone in DC dugout,2
Stoinis to Saini - You should have gone for the head.,6
"Can't believe RCB didn't give us zamp v stoin, they deserve this",4
Why is Saini bowling again.....there is Dube there too right,1
"If game is tied, we decide the winner by doing Dangal b/w stoinis and saini",9
Picking a dark red car to market under the night sky was a poor choice.,5
Not a great idea by Saini to piss off the largest guy in the stadium,13
Stoinis really taking Saini to the cleaners after that beamer.,3
"I'm a RCB fan, but I want Stoinis to destroy to Saini in this over",5
RCB shouldnt have released Stoninis.,2
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ Stoinis Tek my energi ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ,5
What was that throw loo,3
[deleted],2
Rooting for Stoinis,2
i wonder if stoinis juices,0
Phew that was close.,1
Lol ....,1
Thick pant getting tired.,3
"Stoinis gave up, Damn Pant that was easy 2",5
We're fucked,2
This thread is very protective of their Australian Jat.,5
Bad throw,1
If I was saini I’d double down and bowl bouncers,8
What the fuck kohli?,7
Marcus Stoinus is like a Roman general name,3
Fuck off Pant,4
Bruh moment,6
Fatty pant,5
RCB are too afraid to get Stoinis out now,2
Luck is heavy on Stoinis’ side today.,3
Why Kohli is not abusing himself for that ridiculous fielding,15
That was easy run out,7
Absolutely Village.,5
बैल isn't known for his speed anyway.,3
"Not seeing the match live, however I realiized Saini had send down a nasty beamer. Unfortunate.

But audience be cautious.

JJBumrah - losing his touch - N Saini and T Natarajan showing promise - forcing Mumbai Lobby to do some underhand tactics",2
Pant tired of running 2s 😂😂😂,7
"RCB fielding strikes again. Kohli fumbles and curses himself? Also, poor by Pant.",5
Stoinis angry at everyone now. Pant also got a piece of his mind,4
Doesn't feel like a **gentlemen's game**,1
Pant should start running 2s ffs,4
Kohli enjoying Stoinis innings so saved him.,8
That's absolutely Cunt level shit running,6
Koach's overenthusiasm is showing....just calm down yo....,8
Rishab want the strike,2
Bout time Pant!!,4
Game far away from RCBs reach,2
Bad Panty,2
"Stoinis is pissed, rightfully so",7
Saini gonna get absolutely cunted by the end of the innings.,3
Keep bowling in the slots lad.,3
Stoinis is really angry lol,1
Pant wouldn’t have run a double. Good call by him but should have communicated it better with stoinis,4
Pant getting his ass kicked today,-1
Thanks to Saini for getting Stoinis triggered,3
What is with players leaving RCB and playing like 3-4 times better.,3
"I'm sorry but I have to say this.

SAINI KI MKC",4
Finally pant,3
Pant : BRO I WANT STRIKE TOO,8
YES BROTHER,1
Getting from bad to worse for RCB. Similar story for VK and ABD lmao...,1
2.4 overs 43 runs. Saini exposed,3
AB just looks tired of playing for RCB.,6
I'm sure this is a repeat of the kxip game,1
"Ffs Pant, I wanted to see Saini vs Stoinis",1
Kohli trying to look confused so that he's not held responsible for missing that run out.,3
"Saini, Steyn, Umesh, Udana, no one can bowl at the death or what",1
"Seriously, would it have hurt any more if dube was bowled instead of Saini?",1
Lol..Pants wanted to keep strike..now watch him take single of last ball. It's like gully cricket,1
Saini is also getting hit now. Rcb virus has got him too,1
We are clearly rattled first Chahal now Kohli,1
"damn saini has lost it 
 
where are those yorkers",2
Matchlosing performance from Saini,3
Whats better than running for runs. Here have a six. Big brain time.,2
Ironically if Virat had been a bit lazy that was an easy run out,8
"Give it to Dube , enough if Saini , he is following his senior Ummi today",2
Now this is a challenge for the in-form Kohli,2
pant deliberately did this to cool stoinis.. soinis would habe got out trying to overhit,3
Saini ki ragad di Khaini chuna laga ke,3
4D chess by Pant to make hulk more angrier,10
So Saini probably couldn't bowl out today. Udana has 2? And does Siraj have one more? Or Chahal?,2
Stoinis surely has gulped some pre workout before coming to bat.,5
220 on the cards,2
"Someone here rightly said first 16 overs is never the problem for RCB, the last 4 overs are.",10
The Altroz links are incredibly accidentally Alan Partridge,3
Pant didn't want to run a second because he wanted to play some cricket,4
Ye jo bhi ho rha hai Saini ho rha hai - Koach,16
Wow.... Wht happened to Saini this match?,2
Saini closing in on his half century.,3
"For Saini's confidence in the rest of the season, he shouldn't be bowling his 4th",7
Now watch as we get bowled out for under 130,9
Stoinis tonking every RCB bowler cause he didn't got chance to bat against Zampa.,11
There wasn't two there.,1
*Fuck it bowl fast*,7
Saini has brought his own destruction here,2
It might be an unpopular opinion but I love kohlis aggression on the field,9
Stoinis looks like a man on a mission,2
"Cmon Saini, bowl those beamers nah",1
Cheeky pant,1
If he bowls another over he'll break the record for most runs conceded by a bowler in IPL,3
Smart batting by **wild slogger** pant,4
"Pant classic batsman.

I will take the strike. Thank you.",4
This is what happens when your Assassination attempt goes wrong,14
Saini has been taken to the cleaners tonight.,2
Saini bowling like Siraj and Siraj bowling like Saini today,3
nice high elbow,1
I think Siraj pulled a Face/Off on Saini.,7
"Bowl slow balls, man",1
Saini is having a nightmare here.,3
"Saini and Siraj have switched roles for today's match, it seems",2
"Stoinis man, calm down. He's still pissed at Saini and wants to send him to Sharjah and abu Dhabi. That was bad there from stoinis, he wanted to take his anger out on Pant before trying to return to the crease. He really needs to put that shit aside and keep hitting",10
Ohhh yes. Fuck it ball pies fast.,6
Basil Thampi record in Danger here,1
"Saini now: Fuck it, Don't bowl fast.",8
220 on the card here,1
Could we get this Pant in an Indian jersey too,4

"Yo Saini, this is Karma.",7
"If you are not gay for Stoinis, you're not man enough",10
Udana can’t bowl worse than that can he...?,6
Where is that flamboyant hitter Pant?,2
Kohli looks shell shocked,4
Rcb has lost,2
Cricinfo is stuck at 15.3!!,3
Anybody wonder if Koach will give Saini another over? :),1
Dam Saini getting the shaft,1
White people being contractually obligated to pretend to climax on air about crappy Indian hatchbacks is undoubtedly one of the pleasures of watching IPL.,13
"Every time RCB bowls, the God's flip a coin and pick one bowler that's going the distance. It's Saini today.",3
Saini doesn't seem confident of landing Yorkers at will just yet. Might as well change the field and shift the point of attack. This is where you need a bit of proactive captaincy.,8
Aakash Mehta looks a retard in that ad,1
Which RCB bowler gets a 50 today?,1
Saini is having that kind of a day when you wished you just sprained your leg in the morning and you didnt have to come out of the bed. Or get mild asymptomatic Corona if you want to keep up with the times.,4
Saini still has an over left 👀,1
Saini has lost his radar...Shaun tait used to bowl angrily all over the crease and used to get belted,3
Delhi has too many colours on their jersey,2
Score predictions anyone? I'm guessing 210,1
Fuck it. Bowl fast. Has paid off today.,5
Download Cred baby Download Cred baby,4
150 kph last ball. 🚀,1
Fucking shit,1
Can anybody tell the song usedd in the boAt headphones advert,2
"Pant wtf, wanted to see Stonis tonk couple of Saini",3
Saini immediately bowled a bouncer to rashid after he had a bad collision . Glad he is getting cunted now.,7
"FUCK IT 

BOWL PHAST",3
Lord Siraj's spell looks good but he brought Lord Umesh's spirit into this side of RCB.,3
Imagine now bowling out Chahal by the 16th. DISASTERCLASS FROM KOHLI AND RCB LETS GOOOOO,4
"Saini 18 balls: 15 fulltoss, 1 Beamer, 2 Good Length",2
another easy 50 runs from here. No way are we chasing this,4
Well serves saini right for being a bit of a dickhead,11
Score is 161-3 after 17 overs,2
"Stoin: when you don’t pick zampa, you pay for it",6
"Pant is the real deal Samson is a 2-3 match wonder each season and nothing more ,Pant can be better than Dhoni in tests and T20s just need to stick with him",9

Uda na Uda na,2
"Full toss outside off with mid off in, nice one mistiming that Pant",1
Umeshh anna to coach: even I can do that,9
Siraj transferred his luck to saini,2
Did Saini and Stoinis get into an argument? Missed the last 3-4 overs thanks to dinner.,2
"Siraj bowling the 19th scares me, even if he's bowled well today",3
Every player released from RCB has performed like crazy but didn't with RCB. Either the team environment is toxic or they are genuinely cursed!,6
"You know how you inadvertently tease and come off as rude trying to impress your crush?

I think Stoinis is doing that to Zampa",9
How tf we managed to score only 7 against him in the super over ??,4
[removed],11
Stoinis pissed cause he couldn't smash Zampa's balls right now.,-1
Dinda style baptism for Saini today,3
Is there a transfer window this season?,3
Monday Mockery Saini and Siraj exchanged bodies.,3
RIP fair play points for RCB,8
These fucking pre recorded chants at the stadium. What flames me more is the fact that the cunt shouting them got paid for it,6
" so Siraj has a over left, and Saini as one well,

Who will bowl 19th over ?",5
"Umesh was feeling useless on the bench last few matches. To contribute, He has started giving death bowling lessons to Saini.",12
Harshal who open batting for Haryana is at no. 11 lol,6
Woid,1
"As cliche as it may sound, Kohli is a stupid captain. Saini went for runs in earlier over he still chose him.. Not much guidance to calm him down either...",-1
"Watching RCB games makes you feel like an expert 
 
You can tell pretty early if they're gonna win or lose",3
Can't wait for an angry Kohli to chase this down for an absolute masterclass in Dubai.,6
Wow 43% to 4% behind the wicket for Pant,2
Great to see Delhi capitals showing solidarity with the LGBT community. Proud boys.,6
"Always thought that a free hit for overstepping is harsh, particularly with cameras picking up the tiniest margins.

My suggestion would be that a batsmen is still called back if a bowler oversteps, the bowler has to bowl it again and there’s a run. But no free hit. So the next ball is bowled as normal.

Keep the free hits for the waist high full tosses.",2
"New Saini strategy, kill the batters if you can’t bowl yorkers.",6
"last 4 overs 59 runs .  
One catch drop

one run out missed.   
Peak RCB",12
Surely got to get 200 here!,1
Smith with his giraffe neck,5
Stoinis' smile never touches his eyes...,1
"RCB should win this man, it will be a huge statement",-1
I think Delhi hasn't lost a match after scoring 200 so it's going to be hard for RCB with stoinis fired up,1
There's something wrong with saini lately. He's a great and humble bloke otherwise. He bowled slowly to pant to not look any worse.,3
Can someone explain the Saini Stoinis thing? Is it just the Beamer?,1
STOINIS IS ON A MISSION,2
"Alright, can we move on from Saini talk",2
"Guys guys Zampa and Stoinis do the gay sex

You may laugh now",10

Poor paddikals gonna be under pressure now and get out early,2
I saw Stoinis bringing back Love cafe with Pant. I would be worried if i was Zampa.,2
Time for the Saini hype to immediately die down. After last game I saw posts of him in people’s teams for India in the t20 WC. People will now want him dropped in the post match thread here.,6
Aakash Chopra making all the excuses in book to justify Kohli anger issues.,7
Fk. Y lyk dat.,3
20 upcoming and RCB 100 all out,6
Kohli's field positioning is clueless,2
200 back on the board,2
What's the par score on this ground?,2
This is too painful man,2
Imagine working hard to get jacked like Stoinis and there is a guy on the other end built like Pant with the same power lmao,6
How did that go for 4? What's this field.,3
I don’t know why we don’t keep hitting throughout.,3
That onslaught by Stoinis ensured that Pant could take his time and didn't have to throw away his wicket.,7
"MI vs RR tmw, wow. RR is the only team which has MI's number in H2H games.",3

Damn udana bowling beautifully!!,8
This guy Udana is good.,7
We need a Lord Shardul over from last night,3
Pant has bigger boobies than my GF 🙈,9
Pant is building innings thus sseason and that's good to see hope he converts it big,1
Father Udana is in RCB to hear the confessions of the sinners and forgive them.,4
Too bad Zampa isn't playing tonight . Scenes if Koach decided to bowl him after that over .,3
Even stoinis is hitting it cleanly...2020 is weird,2
This pitch feels like an absolute road and hopefully dew screws up DC bowling.. RCB s game to lose,1
Lmao sundars gonna be the only one with economy in single figures,6
Vintage Pant? Dude he's 21,60
So that’s what a Yorker looks like,11
RCB fans be really scared about the 19th Siraj over.,9
Phew. Nicely done,5
Pant is more equipped to hit Udana than Stoinis. Stoinis can take care of the right arm bowlers.,1
Lovely over Isuru!,7
[deleted],0
no hetty for today,2
Saini 20th over?,3
They say zampa is not well today and the reason for him not well is batting right now,12
Decent over from udana considering the context,5
Now 2 maidens incoming. /s,2
Mast over Isuru Chudana 👏,13
Stoin belting it all over the park this IPL gives me hope that Danny Ric can podium at some point this season. Best mate energies.,11
Pant on fire after that denied 2 runs,3
"Dinda must be proud of his cricketing offsprings.
There's literally 1 in every team.",1
It'll be a miracle if DC are kept below 200 at this rate.,2
Virat seems furious. We are in for a chase.,3
"Siraj has second best economy, 2020 has swapped Saini and siraj souls.....fuck",3
This gona be classic Siraj at the death!,1
This is great from udana,4
That DC jersey reminds me of [Jeff Gordon's rainbow warrior schemes.](https://i.imgur.com/cSoX3WU.jpg) The two on this planet who watch both NASCAR and cricket will get this.,5
"Shaw, Iyer, Pant, Rabada is such a good 'core' to have for DC. All 25 or younger too.",8
Why was Zampa dropped? 3rd spinner woulda been handy.,1
Really glad Isuru stuck to basics instead of over doing it with variations like he sometimes does,3
Excellent death bowling by Udana.,3
If I were Pooran I would be thinking about the monster sixes I hit yesterday and I will be smiling thinking about it.,3
"Apart from that one awkwardly delivered boundary ball, that was a good over given how threatening DC looked before that.   

Still 2 to go. 😪 Pls balance below 190",2
Siraj the 19th and Saini the 20th?,1

"Aakash Chopra be like: ""bowler ka naam siraj lekin ispe pant ka raaj."" Wah.",3
HAHAHAHAHAHAH,1
"Saini did go to apologise to Tewatia. Was continuously by his side when he was being treated. 

Maybe he didn't do it now because 
of how Hayden reacted to Srinath when srinath went to check up on him ? Saini might have such mindset

I mean, Saini will find it easier to talk to Tewatia than Stoinis",2
Why so many beamer someone should fine RCB,2
"They should fire the RCB bowling coach!
This is dangerous. Time and again.",3
All bowlers want to get themselves out of the attack..and make Kohli bowl,2
This fucking guy,5
On free hit that shit is stupid,4
RCB be scared if Rabada/Nortje wants to take revenge on Beamers just in case.,3

RCB BOWLING PLAN: NO BATSMEN. NO PROBLEM.,3
Good old RCB. Nostalgic as an ex fan,8
what a shot for free hit lol,6
Didnt realise i had switched on the MLB by accident,6
Hesson probably made them watch Fire in Babylon before the match,2
If pant gets out this ball it'll be a three ball summary of his career,8
Pant and Stoinis are gonna oppress a minority this over.,5
Sunny will be in the background saying how that was an intentional beamer as well.,9
Siraj gonna Siraj,6
Come on not that bullshit on a free hit.,2
Wtf RCB. This shitty cunty death bowling is why you are memed to death. Have some fucking respectability with your death bowling already ffs,4
What’s with the RCB bowlers. If you can’t get them out try to get them retired hurt. This is the Kohli’s way.,0
Wtf Just throw the kitchen sink at the free hit,4
I can't believe that I'm okay with siraj bowling over saini,6

Siraj vs Pant: Dumb vs Dumber 2,7
And Siraj is back....thank you 2020 for not changing everything,2
Why do I support this nonsense team. 8 runs in first ball,1

I don't understand why everyone in RCB gets so nervous when they're under the pump,2
No problem pant. Well played. Great support for stoinis,1
He is bowling much much better then last season,5
That was a pretty good ball.,0
Pant transforming into Sarfaraz Khan day by day,-2
Another 30+ score,5
Pant continues his streak of scoring 30 odd every innings,4
It boggles my mind that Pant is only 22.,4
Siraj shouldve gone for 4 sixes but ends up getting Pant... Lucky lucky boy,4
"A wasted opportunity, Pant was looking good.",5
Kohli didn't realize that Saini learned this art of beamers from LORD SIRAJ,6
That yorker challenge was totally fail,2
Fuck! Just realized that we could have got Zampa v Stoinis today,2
The bowl is f*cking slipping thanks to dew. Apparently it's too fcing hard to understand without iq level of 71 or more.,0

I see it here frequently but what does it mean?",1

Kohli was bitching about Saini to Negi,4
"Spare a thought for AB who has kept to peak Steyn, Morkel, Ntini etc and now had to jump around at this late age to catch wides off Siraj, Umesh and co",17
Wasn’t a great ball. That was lucky,2
Pant has succeeded in getting out,1
Could have been smacked,1
Pant consistently getting 30+ in the IPL is great!,4
 I take back every mean thing I said and thought about Siraj,4
"lmao, Pant trying new shot on free hit, *big brain time*",7
I would fap for pant's ass if he were a pornster,-1
"**18.2** Mohammed Siraj to Pant, OUT, timber. Pant looks for the big hit over the leg side as Saini pitches short. He is deep in the crease and gives this his all. Siraj, though, has bowled a slower ball, and Pant only gets a bottom edge onto the stumps **179-4**

"Pant is not converting these starts, something worrysome for dc",2
pant with that 35-40 score,3
When will Real Rishabh Pant show up?,3
Very selfish from Rishabh to hog the strike when Stoinis was hitting so cleanly..,2
That's the kind of shot he should have played on the free hit,10
Good acceleration nonetheless,3

"Is it only me, or anyone can see that all players who try to play funky shots these days, can't seem to do so well? Except ABD, maybe.",10
Sometimes specialist catcher Hetmyer is here!,2
Revenge of the RCB rejects.,5
Glenn maxwell academy of how he did that ..works both ways.,3
These 2 are both absolute units,4
Pant doing pant things. First trying that atrocious shot on the free hit and then getting out. When will he learn to get through the innings.,3
"Okay, I gotta know, wtf do the DCP and Aamir Khan say to each other at the end of that ad?",2
Pant deserved to get out after that lund of a shot on the free hit.,7
Why is there 13 RCB players in the ground?,3
"*insert stonks guy here*

boowling",2
Shitmyer,6
kohli the ultimate bakchod,6
Hetmyer sucks in situations like these. Misses everything,2
Okay ex rcb vs rcb,3

That is what happens when RCB takes **death** bowling seriously,3
"Could've easily stuck around and seen this innings through

Dude needs to really add that bit into his batting",2
Can't keep Koach out of the game ffs,2
What the fuck umpire. BC kaise chutiye hai yaar,6
Pant ki batting dekh kar ya main bhenchooood bolta hoon ya BHENCHOD bolta hoon,2
What's the average total on this pitch?,1
Bruh what bowling,1
Kohli listening to the birds and the bees,3
Yes now take a single,3
"Bowler didn't head a thing, so does keepr but koach appealing for a catch.  What's with this behaviour.Should have reviewed then.",1
"Agent Stoinis turning on us

Agent Hetmeyer playing his part",8
So the bowling actually kept it together for a few games now they're making up on lost ground or something,3
Hetmyer Mc not again take a single and get off strike.,6
Stop with this blind hate for pant. Hes playing well this ipl,11
Nothing hurts more than seeing ex Rcb players play so well against you smh,4
"koach acting so outraged at umpire not giving that out, but also not taking a review. :))))",9
Why not give strike to Stoin,2
Hetmeyer and Stoinis both former RCB big buys lol,10
"If this is the one bouncer for the over, WTF was that first beamer? A gift?",5
get that sweet 50 stoinis,2
Nohitmeyer can’t hit,4
Sexy comeback by my boi siraj,2
Pant should have given more strike to stoinis and played out the rest until last over,2
Umpire should have given that out.. doesn't he know that Super V has super hearing ?!,4
My man Kohli hearing edge from the boundary.,7
DC gonna regret this over. couldve been 20+ even after Pant out,2
"I hear voices in my head

You can take the player out of RCB but you can't take the RCB out of the player (except in the case of Stoinis apparently).,7

You know things are messed up when Siraj has one of the lowest economies and 2 wickets,11

Do we get another drs if we use first one in the first inning.,5
"Damn, Lara really likes to suck hetmeyer's cock.",5
Good day at the office for Siraj still,3
Shane warne is probably drowning in his own cum.,3
Hetmyer cucked Iyer’s century and damn near cucked Stoinis’ half century.,3
Yeah give him strike on the last ball,1
"Shit, there is still an over to go?",3
Drinks has to face the last over. Hetmyer isn't smart enough to give him the strike. He wave his bat at everything and miss everything,2

"Barca losing 8-2, United losing 1-6 and Liverpool losing 7-2 are not surprising, but lord md siraj going at less than 10rpo is the most 2020 thing",8

2 Ex-RCBians about to fck RCB just to take revenge against Koach.,3
What.. a .... shot,1
one more over to go. who will ball?,1
"Should had taken single here lol, Heytmyer gonna waste the over now",1
"Beautiful 50 .. what a buy this has turned out for our franchise.. Batting, bowling, fielding , everywhere Stoinis is fantastic..",2
Thank fuck this Stoinis doesn't show up for Australia,4
hetmeyer better take a single first ball,2
Cheeky madlad stoinis,1
if Hetmeyer has semblance of a brain he will take a single first ball.,1
Chahal dropped the match for RCB,6
"Woaaahhh, Siraj ended with a economy rate of  less than 9. 😮😮",4
Whatever Stoinis is paid double it.,3
Stoinis is Delhi’s most valuable player,1
Brilliant from Stoinis. Looks solid,2
Stoinis pls do this in AUSTRALIAN GOLD™,6
Hetmyer sucks on short balls,2
Send Hetmyer 1 down so that he is at least used lol.,3
"That's a super 50 by Stoinis. If he stays in form with the rest of the DC lineup, they are going the distance this IPL.",2

"Stoinis looks hot, cute hot",3
Siraj has bowled well!,4
Brilliant Stoinis,2
Stoinis is an *absolute* unit,3
Wonder how much that Stoinis drop costs RCB,1
Lol these two were in RCB just last year.,3
siraj 4-0-34-2 not bad.,2
"Hetmyer, please hit something ffs.",1
i see another 20-25 next over so target could be in the low 200 range,0
I wanna see Hetmyer come up the order and shit the bed early,1
Warne just flooded his hotel with semen,6
Chahal's drop cost us a good 20-30 runs.,5
Hertmeyer comea in the 18th or 19th over ...teams bowl short at him and he struggles...seen this on multiple occasions,3
This has been phenomenal innings by Stoinis,2
A great over ruined by the first and last ball. That is Siraj in a nutshell. Good overall spell tho.,6
[deleted],0
2 ex-RCB batsmen batting last over. fuk.,5
Thats hetmeyers first clean shot.,1
Hetmyer is an RCB agent confirmed.,5
Thank god Warne isn't commentating to Stoinis' batting today.,8
"Pant really captures the essence of the phrase ""throwing a kitchen sink at something"".

You have enough power dude, just keep your shape. Stoinis in this inning is a good example. Not that at this stage it was too terrible an idea to go for it.",10
"I wonder why Kohli, being a Captain, always likes to field on the boundary? He is a good fielder and can be around the bowlers to have a word or two.",1
"Pant's lowest score this IPL: 28 ,
Highest : 38
Great consistency but not able to convert it into a big innings",3
I reckon Ponting has given the 'dont fucking bother batting if youre scared to get out' speech to Stoinis,6
DK and Rahul pls take notes this is how you save good bowlers for final overs,8
Drink every time a commentator calls Stoinis a brute.,5
I believe the difference between this RCB chase and their previous chase will be a confident Kohli,6
6th fastest 50 of the IPL,1
u/tdlan are you enjoying this? 🤣,2
13 RCBians on the field now,7
"When are they benching Hetmeyer, he really has no purpose and has struggled to hit at the death",7
YEAAAHH STOIN THE GROIN DESTROYER,2
Hopefully 200!,1
Saini has had a shocker today.,4
What's the deal with warne and Stoinis?,5
Hetmyer saved 18 runs for RCB already,5
Trashmeyer at it again.,1
Dropped catch of chahal cost RCB the game,7
how is that pretty economical,0
Why did RCB get rid of Stoinis again?,3
Why tf would you appeal that? xD,4

Ex-Rcbian fuckin us in the ass never gets old,45
Review it man,1

"Batsman walks entirely to the side of the wickets and they still shout for LBW

Great stuff from Udana,5
Should've stayed at the strike STOIN boi,2
Can't wait for Hetmyer to get a 30 ball 80 and shit on this whole sub. I swear to God during the india-west indies series everyone was drowning in their own cum when it came to hetmyer.,10
What's with the colored stripes on the DC jersey? Is this permanent?,7
2019 RCB reunion,6

Delhi flaunting pride 🌈 today?,9
Man Hetmyer is so irritating to watch. Fucking runs around like a toothbrush doing fuck all,4
Finally hetmeyer,1
"Pls hit two more of those, need 200 runs",5
Siraj has better figures than Udana let that sink in,8
Shot Heti!,2
Rabada vs AB excites me.,8
There's been lots of full tosses today,2
"Did DC changed their kit today or  I'm delusional. If yes, then I loved this new kit looks much better.",7
"Apparently, you can take the RCB out of the player, but only when they’re playing against RCB",9
Don't let them reach 200 pls,2
Well the ex rcb squad aged well,2
Thicc Hetty,2
"“Ja Shimron, jee le apni zindagi” Kohli after releasing hetmeyer last year",17
Nice shot Simran,4
[deleted],9
The batsman is struggling and you give him a gift yorker to get going,3
I would love to look at the fulltoss count,2
Rabada vs Abd???,7
Can RCB chase 200,1
Koach drops against kxip cost us that game. Now chahal drops going to cost us this one.,6
Man udana is really good at the death,12
[deleted],2
considering how much Stoinis struggled against Aadil Rashid seems kinda dumb to not bowl out Chahal,2
"Saw a DC fan calling Pant selfish for not giving the strike to Stoinis. 

Just saying, other teams would happily take Pant, even MI",4
Has RCB played in Sharjah yet ?,6
NOW the Yorkers come.,4

Stoinis remains not out so needs to play higher.,1
"Paddikal, Kohli and AB all wearing same shoes?",8
(e)x(-rcbian) gon give it to ya,4
Is Udana the only Sri Lankan this season?,9
Any stat on the number of full tosses?,2
This is going to be very hard for us isn't it,21
"Below 200, moral victory for RCB.",7
Dew factor will help RCB today because DC are playing with 2 spinners.,1
"Ahh, so no 200 for DC. They were looking like 210+ 2 overs back.",8
"Bad throw koach, horrible throw.",12
Bad throw,5
Could've been worse,4
Need a 50+ opening partnership to have any chance here,1
Dammit Stoin why u no do this for us,9
Is this a good score on this ground?,3
[deleted],3
Koach with Shitty throw and tantrums,3
wtf kohli,2
what a shit throw,1
"Solid innings from DC.
Can't believe it's their highest against RCB",2
Reasonably good last over by Udana considering RCB's standard,5
I know Hetmeyer did his best today but Pooran would be better in DC lineup. DCs top 4 is fixed anyway and Pooran was available in 2019 auction,0
less than 200 ..moral victory.,3
"Nice to see a Sri Lankan player playing in the IPL. Its been quite a while, the last one I can remember is Sangakarra.",6
Why do dc have diff Jersey?,1
GUYS IF YOU RECEIVE A LINK TITLED LEAKED SEXY PICTURES OF MARCUS STOINIS DO NOT CLICK IT IS A VIRUS THAT PERMANENTLY TURNS ON THE CAPS LOCK,11
Someone pointed out finch looks like Chris Pratt and now I can't get it out of my head,3
[removed],4
Udana doing justice to his name,5
Hope RCB is not burning out AbD by making him keep.,8
"Happy with the score in the end. If we get ABD cheaply, we are in the game big time.",9
So when is RCB going to play in Sharjah?,6
ESCN?,3
Awesome over by Chudana outside of that six. So powerplay and death overs went to DC and middle overs were won by RCBoyz.,-4
Looks like a *really* good score considering RCB have to face Rabada and Nokia,10
Last 7 overs 94 runs,2
"90 runs in last 6 overs Rcb's bowling is seriously fucked up,they badly need a proper bowling coach,Now need no excuses today I am gonna change my flair and I am full of shame due to my team Bye RCB.
Edit:Changed flair to Paltan Rohitman Sharma!!",5
Well done Isuru. He came back well after being hit for 14 in the first over.,15
Great score by delhi here especially after losing those 3 wickets quickly,7
Atleast RCB managed to keep it under 200.,5
"So Iyer's Sharjah knock was an aberration after all, once again his innings was the one which slowed the whole team down.",-1
"197 to win for RCB. If one of Finch, AbD, Padikkal or Kohli get going, this will turn out to be an absolute humdinger.",11
This would be interesting the best bowling lineup this ipl was one of best batting lineup,7
I will take no one dead in that innings as a win!,9
"Will be a tough chase, but I have confidence especially with moeen in the side",6
Stoinis secured his not out.,4
"well, that’s the most fun I’ve had since tewatia’s innings in sharjah",8
Stoinis and Shimron relieved at not playing for RCB anymore not salty.,4
Is this a good score here?,4
Is Hetmyer's skunk-look temporary or permanent?,4
LESS THAN 200 MORAL VIXTORY,5
"*AB misses an impossible stump on the last ball*

Commentators: Yaha pe Dhoni hone chahiye the",39
I sooooo badly want Ethics to mankad Koach,11
I hope my man's fingers are okay. We already lost Mishy can't lose Stoin the man.,10
"Very good score, RCB need a solid start.",4
Chahal underbowled and Stoinis is top scorer.... Disasterclass from Kohli,10
"i love lenskart ads, mocking horrible fielding is hillarious.",6
Bruh some guy earlier exactly predicted 196/4,9
God dang DC are looking like a well-oiled machine aren't they,4
Match threads are fun. I can literally type the crapiest shit comment out there. I will still get 3 updooots,-6
Koach has been shit in the field this IPL.,4
Well above par here. Delhi have the bowlers to defend it but RCB have the batsman to chase it too. But a tough ask for them.,7
Siraj was the pick of the bowler today!,7
"Still 10 short than what I was hoping for, but a pretty good score nonetheless",4
Imagine paying 7 crores for a specialist batsman and playing him at number 6. What a waste.,4
I wanna see a Nokia bumper as revenge,2
Kohli will have a hard time in Sarjah. Really hope that Morris is fit enough to play by then.,3
Shaw has an enormous forehead for a small face,2
Siraj bowled really good.,5
Let's hope DC defends the total,13
It's so hard to validate putting stoinis in the Aus side for white ball cricket but he always goes and does this shit,3
Shaw looks like an amalgamation of an 18yr old and a balding 50 yr old,7
Shaw is aged somewhere between 19 and 42,17
Iyer NEEDS to be better. But am pleasantly surprised with our total,2
I think this could have turned uglier for RCB if it wasn’t for the last 2 overs.,5
"94 off the last 7 overs, fans of other teams would be pissed, I am just relieved that it is only 94 because there has been bowling displays much worse than this before.",13
We might see 300 if RCB balls first in Sharjah,14
I was so Desperate this game so I could see Stoinis smashing Zampa's balls 😜but Zampa is out sick 🤒,6
70-30 Delhi?,0
What is this new kit for DC?,4
Shiki bhai,4
"Dev ""fuck you"" dutt Padikkal to the rescue",11
62 in 5 is pretty good by RCB standards,15
"Decent total, but RCB definitely have the batsmen to get there.",5
"With all the talk about fitness and fielding you would guess the koach would be one of the better one. But nope, if someone decides to compile all his misfields, dropped catches or bad throws; i bet you it would be a pretty long list.",4
"Would be fun if Rabada bowls couple of beamers to Kohli. Hope he doesn't mind them and take them as ""accidents""",1
Shaw Uncle legitimately talks like a class 12 iitjee aspirant,56
Shaw is a 12 yr old in a 40 yr old's body.,33
"No matter how much Pant scores, he never looks comfortable while batting to me.",37
Imagine Warner ends up scoring some 12k runs in test and becomes the next warne on Comms,10
DC has the perfect team for league matches...i can already see this team crumbling under pressure in playoffs though...if they make it to playoffs...its all fun and games when results are favoring but in knockouts...iyer isnt that charismatic to keep together the leaks of team in playoffs,7
"Shaw, an old man with a 12 year old voice",10
"Hahahaha if this is Shaw holding himself back, I want to see all out Shaw!

Jk that doesn’t last too long, this version seems a little better haha",12
"All things considered, Udana has been quite decent so far.  

I hope Kohli and the staff back him more and find a good role for him. Right now he's bowling opening, middle overs, and death overs... somehow I don't know if that's the best strategy.",21
"Saini aggrevated stoin and then Chahal dropped him on 30, imo cost RCB 10-20 runs",11
How Prithvi can manage to look like my bald animoji and 35 at the same time is beyond me,12
"Shaw is 21

Rashid is 21

just 2020 things",12
Why Chahal didnt complete his 4.......,1
SRH B-Team bowling > RCB prime in-form bowling,9
"Machas, I stepped out for dinner and looked like I missed a bloodbath. Why Marcus why!",8
Kohli should drop himself and play parthiv. It's only the right thing to do,5
Shaw can look young as well as old at the same time,5
This sub is being peak r/cricket expecting Hetmeyer to hit every ball for six when he just came in. Keep it classy,16
 Is this over or at par for Dubai?,3
idk man Koach is kinda sus,3
What exactly happened with Saini? I missed that.part,2
"If RCB score 197, they'll win the match.",54
Prithvi Shaw has had a good IPL so far and a big reason we have been winning,7
People are all hyped for Morris but really he did jack shit for us last season,9
Why no fake age controversy for Shah?,-8
"If Koach can get clean bowled by Axar today, and continue to be shit for the rest of the season, can we have his redemption arc in Australia?",5
Shaw needs to get rid of that pedo stache. Maybe he could sneak into Mishraji's room and grab a spare toupee as well.,11
off topic but does anyone remember the OLED and Cardoon memes,3
It's very delightful to see how far this DC has come along in the past few seasons.,4
Dhawan needs to start pulling his weight man,3
"Cricklytics predicts Rcb- 155/7 ,DC to WIN by 41 runs",5
"Delhi has a really strong lineup. But I think they need to tweak the batting order each match. 

If Dhawan is the first one to get out, Iyer should be no.3. Shaw will be the aggressor and Iyer the accumulator.

If Shaw falls first, Pant/Stoinis should be no. 3 and play the big shots.

Dhawan & Iyer together is runrate seppuku.",12
Even Siraj is taking wickets now. 2020 truly is such a weird year.,9
Is KP tapping that?,-1
Hope RCB doesn’t go crazy right from ball 1 and lose wickets. That’s been their problem in the past.,9
12-Oct is RCB vs KKR in Sharjah. Don't miss it guys. It will be a ride to remember.,23
When is Morris gonna be back? We really need him - with him and Udana we have more options at the death. And we can lengthen the batting too.,6
Does the teleprompter tell them when to laugh as well,6
"KP: Stoinis is a good looking man
(๑˙❥˙๑)",2
Will there be any dew factor this game?,4
"Imagine an infinite ground where you get runs based on how far you hit it. 50m gtfo, 100m 6, 150m 8 and so on. That means dhoni can take it to the last over and score 200 off last bowl to finish the match",14
The girl looks like Tom Hiddleston. Unsee that!,6
"Should have bought Zampa aginst Stoinis ,Stoinis wouldn't have hit him and would have happily given away his wicket Stupid Rcb!!",10
"Really happy with Udana so far in this IPL. Good signs for SL that he's able to hold his own against an on song Stoinis in that situation. 

Only thing I'd like to see him improve is his opening over",17
I pray to the Gods of r/Cricket to sledge KKR management to their senses  just like they did to Lord Tewatia and Siraj today.,13
I know Dhawan hasn’t done anything really bad but has he had one good innings? Feels like a lot of mediocre performances where nobody notices he hasn’t done anything bad but also nothin good too.,7
Kohli has started his return to form. Hope we see a class knock irrespective of the result,14
"I like DC's new jersey, looks a bit gay in a good way.",23
KP flirts a lot doesn't he ಠ_ಠ,10
Rabada won’t fail twice in a row surely!,9
"As much as I love RCB - I desperately wanna see AB as captain instead of Kohli(his mood changes faster than my Wife, very unstable)",12
Stoinis stoining the ball in an LGBTQ-esque jersey is dreamy stuff.,8
Warner shitting on the couch while watching Zampa and Stoinis make out in his OLED TV,4
"RCB chased down 201 at this ground against Boult, Bumrah and Pattinson so anything can happen.

Edit: MI chased down RCB I mixed it up, my bad",3
Pant is such a great player. I hope he sorts out his weight issues and brain dead shot selection.  Possibly India's future keeper,5
Happy for Siraj. Proved a lot of haters wrong. Much better than Umesh.,8
Is this “Roar of the lion” actually serious shit? I mean IPL is just shits and giggles if CSK did not know lol.,8
DC's Jersey looks different 🧐,4
Kohli has an astonishing record against his home city. Hope there is a 2020 twist this time🤞,6
Stoinis has the same haircut as Cummins! Reckon they got drunk together?!,6
"NO RCB match is complete without asking for blessings from an icon of the franchise. 

Please visit r/vinaykumar to pay homage and for good luck.",9
Will we win or will we lose?,3
Rcb missed the trick the only way they were going to stop Stoinis today was to play Zampa(and the catch that chahal put down),8
"Our next 2 games are against RR and Delhi. So, we are not going to top again any time soon.",6
"Udana has scored 41 runs off 15 balls (no dismissals) against Nortje in ODIs, it might be worth promoting him up the order.",6

Need Padikkal to stay in. Seems like a slow player!,2
Stoinis got a lot of flak before the season proved everyone wrong. I threw shit at siraj and he proved me wrong. Surely this season would be known for players redeeming themselves amidst all the shit thrown.,2
"I imagine a scene at an academy where a batting coach points to a video of a few shots played by Rishabh Pant and tells his students ""This is how NOT to bat.""",6
Padikkal looks so confident. I want RCB to win today :') :') they have been really good this season..,3
Ashwin to get Padikkal today,2
Brb gotta go buy laptop from Winning mpl,3
Rabada’s economy is now >8. Sad.,3
Is that Essex fan watching this rcb game ?,2
RCB scored both 201 here and 109. Lol,3
Maybe Stoinis had a grudge against Rcb for dropping him not because of anything but had he still been in the franchise he could have been united with his pal Zampa,5
Rabada looks so sexy in the pride parade jersey,7
"Sachin Tendulkar -

Finchy might just score a big one today with the kind of luck he's been having.,5
Why did DC change jerseys mid tournament,4
Looks like DC's jersey is a result of a partnership with JSW Paints but also the hashtag #EmbraceEveryColor for Pride.,4

What even is fielding and catching!,5
"Whoever is praying for Finch today, you are doing an incredible job!",9

Someone’s been talking to the devil.,3
Ponting must be fuming if all those dropped catches. RCB's fielding rubbing on to Delhi's? Finch is a cat today.,3
3 drops within 2 overs,5
These pitches have shut up all IPL haters who said matches in UAE will be boring like this year's CPL and most PSL there.,5
How can you be this trash? Really? It doesn't even take that much effort. Just put your hands up and catch it.,2
Put him out of his misery ffs,12
Cinch has played 8 balls and been dropped on 3 of them,10
Why does Dhawan always field in the slips when he barely catches anything there?,12
Fielding shithousery masterclass,11
It's rcbs day,5
I want to see Finch score 100 after being dropped 20 times.,7
Pant straightaway was looking towards boundary.. like he knew for sure Dhawan was gonna drop that.. lolz,11

Finch used all lives of Padikal.,8
Fuck Slater’s right way thing. Should’ve just run him out,8
Finally a catch that wasn’t dropped,2
Brilliant from Iyer. Rabada bowled an excellent over so it was a bold choice to go with Ashwin.,2
LOL Ashwin with taped up 9 to be 99 instead of 999,2

"I'd read Padikkal gets out to right arm offies in domestic, good ploy by Iyer",7
"**2.6** Ashwin to Padikkal, OUT, down the wicket, Padikkal shows lack of experience. Ashwin makes him play the shot he doesn't want to play. Slows down the ball, goes a touch wider, makes him drag it to leg where deep midwicket is waiting. Padikkal wants to hit long-on, but he has let a master offspinner make him play the shot he wants him to play **20-1**

Why always dependent on Koach and ABD man. That burnout from carrying your team,3
I just wanted to watch the match without distractions but I absolutely had to check reddit when ethicalmind^TM came on,6
I fucking love Ashwin man. Only guy with the guts to take the heat and mankad some one. Absolutely special guy,16
press F for the mankad memes bois,5
Giving warning goes against Ashwin's ethos. He should have mankad™ him straightaway.,8
I think it's fair to mankad without warning,5
"Why has the boss music started and why is there a health bar ?


DC bowlers probably",5

Arrey BC bowl Nortje!!,2
I'd prefer Rabada bowling to Koach atm,2
Now AB can face at least 40 balls so it's not that bad,5
ashwin played 3d chess by not mankanding finch,7
Looks like Ashwin's lost a ton of weight too. Or it could just be the haircut,5

Shreyas Iyer captaincy masterclass!!!,7

Fuckin ethics chickened out. He absolutely should have mankaded Finch.,8
here's hoping for a big Kohli innings after a loooong time,5
S L A P P E D,2
"should have done it man, what you guys think?",9
Bowling spin early maybe because of dew later on,2
Who does Kohli enjoy batting more with? Rohit or Finch?,1
Ashwin should have runout Finch,4
When it was time to build pressure you decide to bowl fucking Axar patel.,8
ASHWIN SHOULD HAVE DONE IT. FUCK POINTING,7
Imagine Ashwin mankading Kohli,8
Key to DC winning is getting ABD out.,2
I know axar has had a decent season so far but I think he is the most mediocre cricketer in the IPL,10
Wish Ashwin had Mankaded it would have been proper entertaining week mankading Australian captain,6
Take that Meg Lenning 😡,0
Why ashwin taped up on jersey??,3
"Okay so my internet gets so slow after like 10ish PM that I can't watch the stream.

Watched the last RCB vs MI in the form of cricbuzz commentary.

Don't know if it's a good or a bad thing for me at this stage.",2
Kohli be like fuck this left arm dart shit,5
They should have given Padikkal a warning and told him the next time he gets caught he is out,8
I thought the Devdutt guy was Devdutt Patnayak,1
I want a Mankad tonight.,6
Fucking Ponting must have asked Ashwin to not Mankad right away.,9
"Honestly, we don't deserve Ashwin. Cricket doesn't deserve Ashwin. The world doesn't deserve Ashwin.

Dude is just too ethical for us.",18
Ponting talking about spirit of the game is the most funniest thing I've ever heard.,9
Lol what’s the story behind the Koach naming?,5
My god that was close,1
Can you imagine if Ashwin Mankad's Kohli!,3
Missed the trick to let Nortje bowl Kohli,1
I want Pant to sledge Kohli.,8
I really really want Ash to run out VK.,4
Nehra:- bhout kam paya gaya hai Akshar patel ki gend ghume 😂,5
"Ashwin can actually take wickets at will,  but ethics prevent him from doing so. In fact he only allows himself to bowl a wicket-taking ball when he notices a batsman backing up.",14
Wtf what that ball! OMG!!!,3
I had almost forgiven Ponting for the Sydney test because of all the work he has done for the Indian players at DC but now I hate him again cuz he appears to have delayed the abolition of batriarchy >:(,10
If we include the mankad  Finch has 5 more lives,8
dont do this vk dont give me hope,6
rock-n-roll incoming,3
IT'S ROCK AND ROLL TIME,3
Ashwin failed cricket by not mankading Finch there.,8
No way does ashwin have the guts to mankad kohli small balls,5
That's a forward press.,1
Moeen Ali would destroy Axar and Ashwin,2
Don’t think it was the right call to give easy spin to Kohli at the beginning. May be some fast stuff from Rabada would have been ideal,2
I would love to see Virat Kohli and Stokes play together.,8
I'll support Ashwin if and when he mankads or even just warns a top Indian player.,4
"Just tuning in, why are DC wearing a pride kit?",1
You can tell that Koach hates Iyer on the dl because he’ll inevitably take over the reins.,2
Ashwin trying to mankade stoinis was just a plan to put padikkal in pressure and take his wicket. 40D chess,2
Everyone who doesn't mankad is against the spirit of the game.,7
"That was a great ball

Grip and turn",3
Ashwin can say goodbye to his dreams of playing for India if he mankads Kohli.,9
Thank God Pant has learned to stump from behind,3
Why do I feel that Axar Patel is gonna sing 'ye teri aankhein jhuki jhuki' any minute,6
"imagine being asked by r/cricket to do a mankad everytime you bowl and when you finally attempt it, it goes nuts",9
"Umpire just wanted to see Koach's sexy stretched butt.

Shaking my smh with these tharki third umpires.",8
What's up with DC's jerseys?,3
"Get Ashwin to KKR. All of our spinners are shitting anyway. Also, need a captain.

We will let you mankad the f out of every team.",5
I feel like today is a day for a Moeen special,4
Good ball,2
Yes this is gone,2
FOCKKKK YOUUUU Axar Patel haterssss!!!,1
Absolutely horrendous day for Finch,5
YES. YES YOU BEAUTIFUL FUCKING BITCH,4
Here we go again...,2
Fuck off,8
Finch gone,3
Koach and Abd classic incoming...,7
"Lol.. Finch is out of life's... Again, excellent bowling..",7
Its done,4
"Shit, we got Finch. Damn it, that was not the plan.",7
This is beautiful bowling,5
Turns out Finch is only half cat. Sad!,6
Ok that was a beauty,6
Nooooo nooo nooooo,3
"IYER TEACHING KOHLI HOW TO CAPTAIN, LOVE TO FUCKING SEE IT LETS GOOOOOOOO",7
Is there an official ruling from the Modi government banning the BCCI and IPL teams from hiring Pakistani cricketers?,1
He scored 2 runs per drop chance,9
A cat has nine lives. A Finch has 4.,3
Oh well guess 5 is the unlucky number,2
Oh no Finch.,3
Looks like he didn’t get to use all 9 lives.,3
Remember Chahal did not bowl his quota on this pitch!,3
6th time's the charm,6
"Finally, gone. Keep bowling tight.",2
You can't get lucky the fifth time,3
I thought he had 9 lives....,2
We need to replace finch with Parthiv,1
"Tactical drop : use up the pp, works",3
Iyer is a genius isn't he?,5
Axar has been low-key fire this season for us,3
"For everyone asking, Ashwin's jersey number in other teams was 99! But he couldn't pick 99 here while Mishra was using it! So he picked 999 and now he's back to 99.",5
Fuck ABD will come in now.,2
our run rate is going to get fucked this match,6
"Finch's luck ""ran out"", so to speak lol",7
"Finch gets out!
Virat Inside:""oh yeahhhh Its Me and AB time now""",2
Let's hope Ashwin doesn't Mankad anyone,2
Axar actually turned one,6
Collapse started,2
Lmao,1
This is why RCB should never bowl first. The batsman seem to lose their confidence and they crumble.,6
Finch got 4 chances & still fucked up,4
Clearly iyer knows whatever the fuck he is doing,8
Turn? Dayum RCBoyz ship has hit the iceberg.,2
"Man axar has bowled beautifully, deserved that wicket",2
"Apart from that 50, Finch hasn't looked good at all",6
"Fuck what do I know!

I love our captaincy now!!",5
Finch fucking uselsss,2
"**3.6** AR Patel to Finch, OUT,  **27-2**

AJ Finch c &dagger;Pant b AR Patel 13 (14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 92.85",1
Ok finch struggled wayy too much on a flat pitch,1
Best friends coming,1
"130 or less, or win",5
Axar patel looks like dehydrated jaddu,5
Finch and Maxwell should be banned from IPL 😡,5
Fucking hell when did Axar get so deadly,2
[RCB fans :(](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSfhtJYnaGFKCGSftHBMfHVMnpbfk4B4vFkSw&usqp=CAU),1
Isn't axar kinda looking like krunal?,3
Shit pant....you had one job and that was for abd not to come out before rrr was more than 36,1
This bullshit IPL match up counts for jack shit. Ashwin not mankading Finch sets an extremely bad precedent.,10
Finch with an impressive “4.33 runs per catch” stat this innings 😂.,5
ABD be like i have to do the fuck all again. Fuck my life..,3
The only batting partnership that can win RCB the game. Iyer should bring in Rabada on here.,2
"Finch pathetic,he got 3 chances and still fucks up and why is his strike rate so poor these days",3
"Finch out after given 3 chances

Lady Luck: Am I a joke to you?",3
Goddammit Axar! That was not the plan,1
Here comes the collapse,2
Gonna change my flair to dc after this match yeasss,1
"30% of me thinks of a big Virat - AB partnership

But the rest just wants to switch it off and just chill and watch some YouTube",7
When you have Rabada and Nokia and the spinners take all the wickets,2
"This is Classic 2020 RCB, can't chase big scores",4
"'kay so we are in this together... do it Anna!!!! mankad Koach next over!

>!for the memes sake!!<",1
"Trust me guys playing spin is no joke

(Faced spin bowling during college match)",5
Axar Patel or Krunal Pandya,2
Familiar RCB script,3
"Axar is severely underestimated, guy is extremely crafty",3
What’s with Finch and Maxwell being gun for their international teams but absolute shit at IPL,9
"How many lives do you need to score some runs??

Finch is the imposter.",2
Alright imma head out,8
Keeper catch off Axar has to be a low point in Finch’s career.,2
13 runs after getting four lives. Don't think I've seen anything worse.,15
It's time kohli step up and play some real innings. It has been long due,6
"We win only if Paddikal scores 50, today we're loosing boys",5
"Nice bowling by Axar, but is it only me or does he have a really punchable face?",2
Well this is a familiar story,5
Virat-Ab Masterclass please,2
Fucking Ashwin and Axar and Stoinis. All of them were shit for us,8
finch buddy you gotta retire from ipl,2
Finch and Maxwell never seem to get going in the IPL. Always looking uncomfortable and out of shots,6
"I was honestly worried that RCB was gonna return to top form.

I mean, think about how much less fun the IPL is when RCB aren't a meme team.",8
Just win. Like how hard can it be,7
"Have to give one over to your best here with their best batters in there.

Gives it to Harshal Patel!",7
Every single DC player is giving me gay vibes with their jersey lol,1
Im still on the edge of my seat as long as these two are not gone,5
Discount Pandya package at it,3
"After seeing the replays, can all those who give Ashwin shit “fOr PrEmEdItAtInG” please stfu. If a batsman is trying to steal a single you better believe I’m going to premeditate the next delivery",20
"Surprise surprise, it's once again upon Abd to play saviour 😣",4
Ashwin scared to bowl to virat and abd?,2
Iyer looking like a genius bringing in the spinners in the powerplay.,6
"Havent been watching much (any) IPL this year, whats up with the fake chanting?",0
Confidence can do you wonders,1
chheeee cheeee gandii bowling!!🤢🤮,1
"Bad first ball, calm down boy.",1
Finch was absolute garbage today. No offense.,5
"Kohli and AB batting so Iyer decides to feed them Harshal Patel?

Big yikes",3
"Why would somebody name their kid - Axar?

It is like naming your kid - Alphabet.",0
Not Finch's fault. Virat and AB are destined to be together,7
Now it's gonna be fun.,2
"Axar ""Budget Jadeja"" has bowled better than real Jadeja so far",7
i heard morons lmaoo,1
Why harshal? Bowl rabada or nortje,2
Y’all saying Ashwin should mankad kohli as if kohli won’t explicitly stand behind the crease when Ashwin is bowling,6
9000 T20 runs for mah boi. Let's gooooo,7
"Kohli looks pissed

I can only hope",5
Want the old bc mc Kohli back,3
Is Harshal  bowling with gloves on,1
ABD + Kohli 170 partnership coming as answer to 180 FAf and Watson 180 partnership?,1
Should have brought Rabada for one more over instead of Harshal,3
Unpopular opinion : Axar Patel is an underrated T20 player. 73 wickets in 85 games with an economy of 7.3. Can bowl in powerplays too. Batting strike rate of 125 is decent as well.,5
"When Kohli gets out, I hope Pant says: Gotta go! Gotta go! Gotta go!",2
Why harshal and not Rabada. Bad captaincy lol,2
"Sunny: Vegeta, what does the scouter say about Kohli's T20 runs?",3
"How badly can you bowl!

I will give Virat a absolute freebie!",5
"Kohli 100 coming up..

you heard it here first",0
"haha RCB match Hoge!!!!

Translation: RCB is screwed very early!!.",3
I love to see Kohli smash Delhi,2
Kohli will hammer you all day if you ball him on the pads,2
Does RCB have a replacement for Finch ?,2
"In all our games we have played more than 5 bowlers inside powerplay, and it has worked out for us most of the times

This is something Dhoni did last season if I remember correctly, interesting tactic",1
"Finch moved that front foot about 1cm towards the pitch of the ball. Almost like he lost his wicket in his mind first.

Axar surprises me more times than he should. Really a utility player.",1
Finch and Stoinis use the same bat,1
What are they saving rabada for?,1
"These 2 needs to do 150 run partnership, if they wanna see them through",2
Harshal Patel kaun hai bc hatao isko:(,0
"BEST vs BEST

Kohli/ABD vs Harshal Patel",10
RCB fans to Koach and AB since 2011: I'm once again asking you to save us and get us over the line!,16
Kohli and ABD chasing on a small ground. Nice,4
Hope Harshal concedes runs like he used to when he played for us,5
Koach over 9000 runs!,3
Eeeeeeeeeziiiiiiii,3
Someone sledge Kohli right now pls,3
BC kyun throw kar rahein ho. Did you not watch WC 2019 final or some shit!,3
"If these two bat till the 15th, they going to steal about 15 20 runs in the outfield.",4
Finches confidence was destroyed after that warning from Ashwin.,6
"When you’re so out of form, that you nick off to Axar “Dart” Patel",4
"Imagine Kohli getting a hundred here🤪, haha not really😌... unless 🥴",6
Love seeing Finch play for the the Australian team but he's not his best in RCB,4
That flick gave me 2018 MCG nightmare,3
"Kohli VS Ashwin

ABD VS Rabada

**LETS GO**",6
They do run fast af.,8
I'm more worried about Moeen too,3
lol Pant didn’t follow the spin of the ball and it edged right into his hands,6
I’ll give the benefit of doubt to the statistics and say Virat and AB would choke this run chase,6
Kohli looks like a man on a mission today. The intent on his face...,6
"If this over don't go over 8, DC would be quite happy",2
"In every other team, other players step up to perform. In RCB, it’s only Yuzi ABD and VK",3
"I don't have an issue with Mankads at all when they are employed within the rules. The rule is from when the ball would normally be released from the bowler. In this instance, and the same for the Buttler one, and the Afghanistan u19 WC one, and potentially the Windies U19 one as well (can't remember it that well), the batsman would still have been in his crease when the ball was released.",2
Stoinis should share a few words with Kohli... we do know how much koach loves the aussies,3
Video of Ashwin mankad warning?,1
Please no run out,2
"Harshal has been one of the best performers in the domestic season, man took 2-34 in sharjah. He is pretty solid should not concede madly",3
Would love a Kohli-ABD partnership like the good old days.,7
Delhi players are gonna get much needed fielding practice today.,2
ahh fuck don’t remind me about tomorrow,2
Aye what happened someone told me Ashwin mankaded ??,2
"Pant was right when he shouted ""isko mt daalna yeh waala"" the ball before Finch was dismissed",3
Tail for RCB begins after this.,4
Kya chak rha hain?,1
"Ngl, I would looove seeing ashwin trying to mankad kohli 😁",5
"In an alternate reality, DD picked up Delhi youngster Kohli who captained them to 5 consecutive IPL trophies.",8
ABD shouting “CATCH IT” to his own batting,8
Finch was ridden with guilt after being taught the lesson of ethics by Ashwin! He asked lady luck to go away after that.,6
AB,3
Another for Axar please and thanks,2
"Kohli to Pant at 4.5 over: Gaand mein le le

T: Shove it up your ass",3
Harshal's action reminds me of Mohammad Sami,5
MRF bats > everything else,10
"I think kohli's entire game straight up depends on his self esteem. On a high, you see him grabbing singles, energetic, putting bad balls away. Basically taking the fight to the opposition.
This is the time when he is the indestructible kohli we know.

On a low, he doesn't try to respect the conditions. Except when we played tests in england last year. And the last game this ipl where he scored a fifty.
What do you guys think?",11
Has this God of a man ABD ever been out of form?,10
"Nobody :

Pommie Mbangwa : ""Shouts of catch it,nobody will""",4
"Hardhal goes for 11 against Kohli and ABD!

What a surprise!!",4
"Why bowl harshal in pp, that was kind of a blunder, don't push your luck iyer",7
DC can only win if they can get Koach and Abd.,4
"Finch innings was weirdest ever. 4 chances and a MANKAD opportunity.

Strange indeed.",15
"Kohli after the run today :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Over_9000!#/media/File:Over_9000!.png",8
"Why do I have a bad feeling about this match? 
Are we gonna lose this?",8
DC needs to bring on Rabada before these two get settled,6
https://twitter.com/BerbaSpinCric/status/1313152731616620545?s=19,3
"I have a feeling AB shouted ""catch"" instinctively at the shot himself",8
No leg spin against these two. Basically this is their best chance for a massive partnership.,3
Bring rabada and stop this partnership,3
[deleted],6
"Well things haven't been going good after MS's poor batting v SRH

1. Irfan tweets that age is just number for some and for some it's reason to be dropped.

2. Harbhajan quotes it with '10000%' agree comment

3. Today Irfan tweeted that, if those two lines amazed you, you will feel dizzy after knowing the whole truth 

Holy shit",13
Kohli getting his shit together love it dc fans be ready now,2
Holy fuck,2
fuck what is this man shit,3
Throw all the best bowling at these two. They don’t believe in bat deep anyway and you need then out to win the match!,2
You have to have brains of a donkey to oppose mankad and give a warning.,0
"I love seeing these two bat together , but please..not today",6
Pffft Swanny doesn't remember the number to call an ambulance in England. Someone remind him please. 0118..,3

Kohli Kholi?

Indian Northie bros will get it ;)",1
"God AB looks so good while batting, South African board should still eat the humble pie and beg him for a return ahead of next World Cup",6
Bruh Ashwin just end it,3
Kohli overexcited,2
Finch passing on his luck to ABD and kohli,2
"Oh ab, you beauty.",2
"BC catching and run outs are dreadful for us! 

3 stumps to hit! Has to hit!!",3
Ashwin should've run out Kohli,5
"Pant transferring his panic to RCB ,good stuff.",6
"Gone for all money.

That collective Groan though.. OHHWWWW",2
Ashwin reacting as if gaand me salia ghus gaya. Overacting,-3
Who was that who did woooooooo? 😁,1
fuckin sex,2
Better fielder hits there,2
How many more lucky breaks RCB will get this match?,0
Out,2
Need to take in every moment of AB and Kohli batting together,5
I really hope our fielding doesn't cost us this match,6
Thank god Ashwin throws like a Jadhav,5
CYA,2
YES. FUCK YES.,3
Nokia you beauty.,3

Was that Kohli with the 'whoo!'? Nice that he's having fun!,7

COLLAPSE BELOW 120 COMING???,4
"Despite knowing that he's gonna play throughout the tournament,

Finch looks the least confident player out there in the middle.",6
N series delivers,3
Gabbar looks fitter than pre-covid !!,2
RCB being RCB. Nothing new here lads. Their fans know and so does r/cricket,6
Over,4
Ah shit RCB in big trouble,3
Dilli! Dilli! Dilli!,6
Always liked Nokia over Samsung,15
Bad shot AB. Playing across like that to a 145+ bowler isn't gonna end well most of the time.,3
"Alright folks. That is the match. On a positive note, I can get back to work :)",3
"NO NEED LMAO, THEY'RE MEMEING THIS GAME SO BAD",2
What a stupid shot 😞,3
"DC fans when that ball was in the air:

Hey ishwar, ya Allah, ye pukaar sun le!

Hey ishwar, ya Allah hey daataa!",0
"Dhawan is pretty much chaotic energy personified 
 
I can't tell whether he'll catch or drop it",8

DC BC!!,3
Are we gonna get a 2016 Kohli classic now or is RCB gonna choke?,3
Why do I fell like the match is over when Kohli is still there and Moeen yet to come,5
Well it was a fucking great catch considering how high it went,6
download cred baby,5
Nokia stonks,7
"Ok, I'm sleeping",3

Welp....I guess that's it for tonight.,3
Match is over,2

Looks like collapse is on the menu bois,5

Meme team is back Bois,7
Who owns rcb now? I could prolly look this up but fuggit,5
Nokia is the man!,6
Ab getting out feels like Tendulkar getting out in the old days,5

Oh wow. Into the tail already.,0
"**5.5** Nortje to de Villiers, OUT, finally someone takes a catch **43-3**

No point in wasting another hour watching this match.",5
"Guys don't lose hope, RCB has ~~stokes~~ Dube",7
nice bouncer nortje,2
Eye war,1
"Well, that's that it then. Koch and Mooen to minimise the NRR damage..",5
ABD can't keep & bat 15+ overz it's too much pressure on him,12
"We can legit say that if DC had taken all their chances, RCB would've broken their own 49 record",12
COLLAPSE :(,3
Yes good bouncer!,1
Koach gonna 100,2
"A true 360 player, turned back right towards the dressing room.",15
Well well good night guys.,3
Love ittttt,1
"i don't even want to make fun of the rcb or rcb fans, man. like, i honestly just feel bad. it sucks! i know!",2
Oh fuck forgot about Moeen and the damage he can cause,2
Why are they trying to provoke Kohli wtf,7
Woah woah Kohli and Nortje going at each other,4
It’s hard to take both Siva & Sunny together in the com box,5
finch shouldve transferred his drops to ab or smth,3
Bowl 3 from Rabada now and finish the match!!,2
"Fuck the Intent, Save the NRR",7

How does rcb manage to collapse more than any team.,3
Btw guys hating on rishabh pant isnt a personality trait btw.,4
"If you gonna field first after winning toss in this humid desert for 20 overs and wont even restrict the team under 200, its just a stupid decision Kohli - I know you copying Dhoni here but pls use your brain and know your shitty bowlers.",0
"why is dhawan called gabbar singh, the guy from the movie sholay?",1
Okay now get kohli out,1
DC is GOAT this season,2
Iyer is too eager to make bowling changes. Should have let some bowler bowl at least 2 over spells. I see that almost every game. Sometimes that affects rhythm. Today it does not matter as RCB keep losing wickets.,1
Nortje went unsold in the auction lol.,9
pant’s sound effects are cracking me up,5
Even Dhawan was surprised that he caught it 😂,4
"Thank you Gabbar, sorry I yelled at you for dropping the catch earlier",1
"This is the moment, Ashwin to kohli, man I want some banter between these 2",1
"Pant :Oi huhuhuhu 

T:Ape together strong",7
Is someone continuously tickling pant or something??,5
Lol chahal with a SR of 43. Walking wicket,1
Afrikaner on Afrikaner violence,2
One of these days one of the batsmen are going to turn around and bash Rishab pant's head in.,12
Pant speaking > AB speaking,2
Oh fuck yeah I forgot Mo was playing. Can't wait for him to spoon a half tracker straight to midwicket on 3(8),4
"If Ashwin mankads Kohli, pretty much end of his international career for India correct?",9
I think Virat should start opening again. Finch has failed to do what he was bought for.,3
Ricky Ponting writing Shayri in his diary,8
"RCB back to normal, the 2020 effect waning off. Stupid decision to chase today. Should have batted first. Also needs to remove keeping duties for Abd if they want him to play his best cricket.",4
RCB is going to get obliterated in this match and then won't qualify cause of bad run rate!!,2
"Nooooooooo why Ab 


I’m legit crying rn",4
now they are just toying with us..🥺,5

"Someone said Moin gonna hit ethical bowler, let's see. He will get out to him. Am calling it now",2
Moeen against offspinner. What could possibly go wrong,4
I love watching DC bowl just to hear Pant behind the stumps,5

Btw why did Delhi even get rahane? Was it just to weaken other teams? Hes not even getting 1 game lol,10
Ashwin mankads kohli thing you would love to see,8
I guess Dhawan was thinking of thigh-fi soon after the ball went into the air.,8
"The problem with Iyer as a captain is whenever a bowler or fielder makes an error, he always makes a face or facepalms or shouts at the one who made the mistake. Sometimes captains have to let these things go to help the bowler or fielder.",11
Shot of the day.,2
So I want Kohli to perform but I want DC to win.,2
Woohooloooleeeeaeeehooo,3
Ok get him and vk out,1
Everyone and their mothers know that you bowl short to Moeen and don’t bowl spinners to him.,4
why am i even watching it anymore,8
Pant can easily walk into the Pak and SL sides of 90s with the amount of chatting behind the stump.,12
Will we get Moeen Christopher Henry Ali or Moeen Chris Martin Ali?,6
Was soo gassed for a Virat-ab masterclass and then this happens. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined,13

Ngl Kohli at the crease is intimidating.,10
Guys i think Ashiwn deserves another Limited Over run for India. He's been bowling beautifully. He should replace Kuldeep,7
I hope Pant knows Moeen can understand Hindi,18
It’s good to see RCB pro and RCB lite returning  to their natural order.,6
Would the rcb bowling be any better if Steyn is picked replacing Saini ?,2
Ethically Superstitious 🐐,7
Did Ashwin just take Mishra's number?,10
"DC got everything-

- ok opening pair (Shaw is goat)
- good middle order
- 2 good fast bowlers
- 1 good spinner
- most importantly, most annoying keeper in the world. who will always play his role in any game",12
Is it just me or does Ashwin look like he gets through his runup quicker than he used to?,1
Didn't know Mishra ji has been ruled out. Boobie has been too. Sad.,6

"Just tuned in, so RCB's back to form",3

You think Koach will turn back and tell Pant to shut up?,18
Kohli trying to chop the ball onto Pant so he can get him to shut up,11
Ashwin should've simply signed out of IPL if he was forced to not mankad. Ponting has to be an asshole.,13

Kohli is looking good after having a lackluster start to the season. If not for RCB it will at least help India,2

Is RCB is batting like CSK or RCB batting like RCB?,8
Haarcb is back,4
"DK: Captaining KKR

Morgan: ye mai kar leta hu...aap Dream11 pe team bana lo",6

Lovely seeing kohli not struggling. Yaayyy,9
[removed],19
Kohli miles out of his crease there ashwin is a wimp,7
Never know when you'll get hit by a smooth BC!! 🎶,6
Rishab Pant,7
Kohli should just open,15
Take all my strength Virat-san (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ,13
I would pay to see kohli smack pant,19
Is Kohli playing for NRR?,10
If this was CSK this sub would be having a field day with tuk tuk comments,46
That pause is fucking illegal.,8
Pant be like “chalo chalo bhaiyo”,20
Pant just doesn't shut up,10
"Ashwin actaully only uses 10% of his brain when bowling, the remaining 90% is occupied with ethical dilemmas.",106
"RCB’s next match is against CSK.


Oh yes, it’s all coming together.",19
If Rcb gets knocked out then I'm supporting Dc,8
How old is ashwin?,5
I think the match is over for RCBoyz but let's just enjoy the dragon's batting.,10
When Ashwin stopped I thought he is going for mankand,19
That pause is fucking annoying Ash,12
Hate that pause,9
Koach still looks calm af,15
Ashwin lagging. Is that allowed lol?,35
What the fuck did Ashwin achieve from that pause?,13
"Finch should be dropped,he’s very inconsistent and playing extremely slow. Most importantly he’s got 3 chances and still fails to deliver, Dhoni persisted with Watto yesterday when no one believed he should have and he delivered with a match winning knock but Finch is just constantly disappointing",5
Nortje just needs tracks and he will be steaming off to Sharjah,5
Pant reminds me of my late Grammy. She had to have a comment for every little thing. Good rest her soul.,11
What's the rule for replacement players? Can delhi retain nokia for next season?,6
Strategic Ad placement.,4
Will Ashwin get into the LOI team if he takes a hattrick while Koach watches it from the non striking end?,4
Pant doesn't shut up man,7
I'm the strategic time-outs I expect y'all to refresh your shitposting arsenal and not waste time.,6
That shot from Kohli reminded me how sachin used to play that shot for boundary,6
"Kings XI shouldn’t have released Ashwin, they should have just taken the captaincy away from him, he still does a job with the ball, his captaincy was awful, but their new captain is pretty awful as well so there is that.",11
Delhi do strange things after the timeout. I won’t be surprised if they bowl Stoinis now.,9
RCB should change their name to Jack Daniels Bangalore and maybe try next season,9
"Something that Ashwin does are beyond our ethical sphere of understanding, it’s best not to question",7
Pant should sledge kohli,7
"Axar needs to continue, Moeen will hole out at mid wicket for sure... LETS GOOOO B OYSSS",4
"The boat ad has lyrics, “mother lovers”. Ok",8
"Forgive me lads, because I’m about to simp for Ana De Armas right fucking now!",8
Ashwin paused to refresh his ethics,5
Is it fine that i want DC to win but also VK to score big?,8
RCB has started playing for NRR this match like us,5
Baby you are my CVV I am your OTP 😂😂😂,24
Pretty sure Kohli thinks Ashwin is a chutiya everytime he does the pause,15
"Dravid setup this team for success. Signed Shaw, Iyer and Pant three years ago when they were barely known.

Those three form the basis of this strong batting lineup which means they could invest more in bowling and get in Rabada, Ashwin, Stoinis, Mishra and Nortje.",12
Awkward pause,5
Ashwin thinking about his next youtube video during that pause,13
Looks like Dhoni has brain washed Koach to chase after 16th over.,14
"Harshal Patel is the key here.

His 3 overs will be the make or break here",3
"Guys diamonds are not worth their money. Natural diamonds the worst. Synthetic diamonds are good enough if you really need, don't fall for the marketing.",8
"Shreyas Iyer acting 🤢 ""baat toh sahi hai""",5
"It'll be mind boggling if Finch doesn't go out for Parthiv after this one. You get an established guy who'll get you a quickfire 30 in 75% of the games, AB doesn't need to keep in the heat, and you have more flexibility. 

Finch hasn't been an integral part of any IPL team he has played for for a reason.",7
Ashwin pauses in his action to brood over the trolley problem,10
Disappointed in Deepa Malik for endorsing White hat. Admired her a  lot and still do but now she's endorsing a scam.,5
Since Finch ended with a 13(14) the others were tactical drops,1
"God Kohli looks like a man with confidence. He'll chase this, if moeen holds one end up. He'll fucking do it.",7
played himself,2
"Now a bowler can't even pause to fuck with the batsmen.

Fucking batriarchy is worse than soviet russia.",10
Who is that singer in CRED ad?,2
Why special advert only for KKR vs CSK?,2
Are mid-season transfers available this season? I know last season it was there but no team made use of it. Also there was speculation of overseas players being added. Can someone fill me in please,3
"Can't remember the last time we chased 180-200, I know its tough but in IPL you should be able to do it",3
"dropping in a random fact no one asked for..

Hema Malini is 71 years old per Google..!!

just hate the fact that they show her to be younger, as compared to say Amitabh Bachchan...",1
"come on, Koach",1
You guys never watched that Ashwin doing that  pause?,3
"[replay of ashwin's warning](https://www.iplt20.com/video/213145/ashwin-warns-finch), surely Finchy just wanted to get out. There's no way he's backed up that far when ashwin's bowling. No way. He just wanted to get out",10
"Require run rate is more than 12/over. The ground's big. So, wonder how long will they be content with just rotating the strike.",2
At least we wont bowled out for 110 this time,2
Dunno how Swanny did it but Tata Motors broke into \#3 on Sept sales after many many months!,3
Did pant just call Ashwin 99?,5
ashwin should vlog while bowling.,8
Ashwin's living rent free in his own head,10
Whenever wicket alert comes up I get so nervous. They are usually always on point lmaoo,8
"Pant to commentators

yeh mai kar leta hun, aap jaake dream 11 pe team bana lo",50
"RCB doing well here, building a steady partnership. 197 off 50 overs is very chase-able",20
So we are in quantum of loss zone,4
pant just shut up,-3
Want Ashwin to Mankad Kohli,8
Kitne spinners hai inke pas bc,10
Axar Patel kinda resembles sid from ice age,10
When Axar meets Washi: Spidey's pointing at each other,11
Beautiful left arm spin masterclass from ~~Vettori~~ Axar,5
how can we get featured in that virtual fan box? aSkInG fOr a fRiEnD...,5
What a fucking over man,8
Reminder that Axar Patel was part of India's 2015 world cup squad,11
Hmm,1
Can Koach pull off a tewatia,6
I would say the technology has really advanced when my tv would allow me to mute Pant,6
"Following MSD, I see.",3
Tuk tuk comments when,9
SPIN CHOKE SO BEAUTIFUL LETS GOOOOO DC,6
Who TF said ab was close to as annoying as pant is behind the stump,11
Kohli - I'm the new Dhoni now,9
Delhi has got all bases covered looking like a genuine title contender,6
I think RCB have given up on winning this one and are concentrating on improving the NRR.,4
Axar > jadeja in t20s?,2
Why learn this from dhoni,8
I wish an Indian commentator could take digs at Indian players like Swann does at English players without losing his job.,19
Worlds best white ball batsman struggling against dart bowling of Axar Patel lmaooo,6
need 135 of last 10.. easy..,4
Amazon ad is the cringiest,3
How is the mediocre bowler not getting smacked?,3
"If Axar Patel is conceding 4 RPO after 3 overs with his nothing darts, you aren’t chasing 190, not in a million years",8
"Net run rate ko bachao

Net run rate ko bachao",8
What is up with this strike rate. Anyway I am not the master chaser... Kohli is.,3
Fuck it just go for it nobody is expecting us to win here.,5
RCB chasing like CSK does when 3 down.,5
5 overs of Rabada-Nortje still left out of 10 and they still need 130 odd. No chance,7
Boring match😒,1
WHY NO ASHWIN!!!! NOT GOOD IYERR,0
"
You cannot look cool when you put one cap on top of another. You just cannot. No matter who you are.

Change my mind.",3
"I don't get WhitehatJr ads, I have no clue what you guys are talking about, all I get is Saurav Ganguly asking me to gamble and Swiggy coaxing me to start ordering bad food again",3
 Kohli channelling his inner dhoni,1
lol Kohli farming strike to protect Moeen against the spinners? You love to see it,7
Harshal Patel runs faster than he bowls,6
Koach channeling his inner dhenier,7
i guess they're already playing for nrr? 4 dots in axar's over is.....,4
"Well this match is done, right?",5
DAE highest average in successful run chaces,2
The astrologer who changed the name to Delhi Capitals is earing a hefty sum somewhere,18
The form Moeen is in. I think he'll get out trying to slog Harshal.,2
"Pls if not winning, at least save NRR",2
Cameraman focusing on that ass.,1
Chase aap karlo mai tuk tuk karke nrr bacha leta hun,5
"Should have sent Sundar above Moeen,he’s a decent batsman and can take on the spinners and even if he gets out you’ll have Moeen and dube",0
Ashwin should come back to the Indian T20 team. But Kohli probably wont let him in cause of 'fitness',5
Get them out!,-1
Marcus stoinis six now vs rcb...quick highlight/Rcb vs DC live https://youtu.be/Phm7enPpFNY,1
Graeme expecting Moeen to do something dumb lmao,3
I think it’s cringe when these commentators start jerking some of these guys off verbally and prematurely. Let em play.,2
hoping Kohli turns the game.,2
This is the over to hit plus stoinis overs probably.,2
Wtf koach don't do this,2
"Yeah, not happening. Not today, not tomorrow. Would never leave RCB no matter what, but they can't expect to reach the finals with a performance like today.",2
That strike rate from Koach is as useless as Deep Dasgupta in that my11circle ad.,5
Gotta love how shitposters here think they know better than Kohli/Dhoni/other cricketers.,1
Are comments about lack of intent only reserved for CSK matches?,2
"Oh boy, that short arm jab wouldn't have cleared inner circle in blore too.",1
"Kohli: No you go and hit

Moeen: No you go and hit

...",8
"Strike rate drops below 100

*Is this......is this...........Dhoni !?*",7
Harshal Patel looks like a young Ranveer Singh,3
Rofl Swanney...classic British humor on display,3
Rabada bowling 3 of the last 5 doesn't look promising.,7
Don’t do this Kohli,2
Kohli could play his natural game in 2016 because he had Rahul to rely on if ABD and Gayle failed. Now he has to be extra conservative because the lineup will fall like a deck of cards if he gets out.,2
Joaquin Phoenix laugh by Pant there,4
"Someone hit, pant, please hit pant.",3
Omg 😂 I thought game over,3

VK making mo run,2
बैल laughs as if someone is holding him down and tickling him mercilessly.,2
This Kohli innings isn't that much different from those Dhoni innings people 'called out' a few days back.,10
Koach thinks he's chasing 127 not 197,10
Pant is a monkey on cocaine behind the stumps lool,13
Pant gonna get a BC any moment now,17
Pant’s screaming makes me feel like there’s a chance for a run-out when there literally isn’t,9
Look at that smile... how can you not like Marcus,7
Kohli taking a leaf out of Thala's playbook there. Playing for NRR already.,12
"Nobody:


Pant behind the stumps: AWOOOOO ACKACKACJ WKAKAKAKAKS WHHEHEHEB OUHHAHAO",6

I AM FUCKING BACK,1
"Koach isn't playing for NRR, he's just not giving it away so early",3
Why is Ashwin not part of the LOI team?,3
Kohli inspired by Dhoni and playing for quantum of loss?,8
This is done game..😩,1
"So, when is this sub going to tell Virat to retire out?",7
All these comments gonna vanish when koach hits 20 off one of the next 2 overs,-1
Siraj is the only one from RCB in Dream11 among all DC players. Nice!,3
Koach just wanna let DC get too comfortable and transform into his god mode.,3
Come on Kohli do something,3
From where did this Koach nickname come from? I’m really lost,2
"I've only seen harshal patel getting smashed over the years , what's happened to him ?",3
Let's reach to 150 that would be a win for us,2
RCB's FB n Twitter comment section is gonna be so funny tomorrow.,3
"No guys, the math works out. 7 runs an over for the next 9 overs should easily take you to 197, keep doing what you're doing",3
Wait so the big deal with India going to Mars was to succeed the first time after learning from how others failed?,-1
RCB don't have a player like Kedhar Jadhav to turn it around,6
"Pant has got a great energy, i have to give him that",9
"At this rate, they won't be able to salvage even the NRR.",6

Is it the quiet before the thunder,1
Next batters are Lube Andar Lagana..,2
Kohli is really playing for himself. Even in the rajashthan game we needed to end early to get the nRR up.,1
Love the fact how Iyer's captaincy is considered nil cos Punter is the coach,2
Need a mute pant option on hotstar,5
Swann actually making people laugh from the dugout xD,4
How long have RCB gone without a boundary,3
When was the last time RCB scored a boundary?? Feels like ages ago. I can't even remember. Prolly AD was the one who hit it.,4
"2 set batsmen with strike rates below 100, with target of 197 and required rate of 15, I repeat, set batsmen, not new batsmen!!! What the hell is going on",7
I am thinking it's actually smart and pragmatic to go for NRR now. They are not winning with Rabada's 3 and Nokias 2,3
I have higher chance of meeting my future partner than Moeen Ali meeting the ball.,5
"two batsman at 90sr while RR is 14 .

I thought only csk can do that.",7
Required RR over 14 with 9 overs to go. And RCB are going at a blazing.. *checks notes* 6.3,1
"How it should play out - Kohli has played 30 balls, he is set, should go berserk in next few overs to get the RRR in control.

How it will (most probably) play out (aka MSD chase mode) - Moeen Ali and players to follow will swing the bat and get out. Kohli to hit few big ones in last couple of overs.",5
"Either 6 or out this Ball, Ali",9
Kohli counting on Lord Dube to do it for RCB,5
Mo is No Mo.,4
What the hell is kohli trying to do,2
Can it get any more worse?,3
If I ever see RCB fans talk about intent in csk match threads goiyyala,4

That was koach's fault,1

Swann called the ENGLISH CHOKE,4
What a great 4 overs from axar patel,2
Kohli chasing like the middle overs of on ODI,3
So Mo Ali is not the answer to RCB's middle order woes.,2
I just hope Kohli gets to play last 4 overs.,2
"Interesting that DC are not bringing on Rabada while Kohli looks unsettled. Getting his wicket here will almost end this run chase. If he gets settled, he can even score boundaries off of Rabada later on.",3

Fuckkkk Dc is absolutely ruthless!,5

Oh dear Mo :(,3
Why Kohli playing like Dhoni,4
"Haven't been watching the match, how good's the bowling / how shit's the batting",2
Fuck...ali gone,3
Just no conviction from Moeen in those last 2 shots. Wonder what's up with that?,2
Kohli basically pressured him into trying to hit a 6,3
Don't lose by huge margin!! Please.,3
"Its high time Kohli realises RCB can't chase 180+ totals. 😡

Not everyone plays well under pressure!! 😡",3
kohli learning that cool and calm approach,3
"Moeen was smashing 20 ball fifties 2 months back, now can't even hit Axar",2
Morris getting 10cr to get injured and sit on the sidelines. Fucking amazing /s,1
Mo missing Kuldeep's bowling.,1
That is the quintessential 'Moeen since 2018' innings. Only could've been improved if he softly chipped one straight to midwicket to get out,1
Can Virat still pull it out from here?,1
Moeen is one of those players I will not curse even if they lose cup,2
31(32) Now that's hogging up balls ain't it ?,3
WHERE ARE THE AXAR HATERZ YOU CUCKS,3
Bad decision to bowl first. Death bowling is worst in any case bowl first or second just bat first and follow the trend of batting first winning games.,2
Kohli trying to emulate Dhoni and taking it deep. So deep that match is out of contention and pray that opposition’s key bowler injures himself.,2
"Really wanted to see Moeen get going, when he's on it's a top 3 show to watch right up there with Russell.",2
Harshal fears Kohli too much man,3
"Axar is bloody underrated, if whatever's missing for him with the bat clicks, he's going to be the MVP for this team",3
ANNE FRANK WOULDVE SEEN THAT WICKET COMING LMAOOOO LETS GOOOOO AXARRRRR,5

What is Kohli doing?,2
"If RCB hope to win from here, Harshal Patel needs to have a blinder",1
I think SRH beating Delhi is going to be the highest point of their season. SRH is going nowhere without Bhuvi.,2
How many Hetmeyers are there in the ground. Man is everywhere,3
Why does Ashwin have the 9 scratched out?,3
DC BC!!,2
"Our 5th Overseas Player, Sundar from Washington to get 70 off 17",2
Kohli should stat pad now. Game is gone. Try to salvage the NRR,3
Nice yaar,1
Love you Koach,1
Axar you beast. Slow spinners the move,1
How about Schrodinger Challengers Bangalore from next season?,1
Idk why y’all surprised. After all Kohli is a Delhi boy at heart,3
Fuck that was some timing,5
"RCB bowls badly in the death, has a poor middle order, drops catches. 3D performance team",5
Watta a shot boi,2
Kohli will *accidentally*hit pant with his follow through,3
Sundar at no.6 ? Wtf,2
"""Predictable demise of the Englishman"" - Swann lmao",5

Ati Sundar Shot by Kohli,6
Nice one Koach!,4
I'm satisfied I will sleep now.,5
"Okay Buckle up lads

Its a Virat masterclass or RCB getting bowled out for 130",7
Love to see the management showing intent and sending sundar over dube,2
Finch stop clapping bitch,5
Would love a Kohli special,5
The last time a captain of an IPL team played a run a ball while chasing \~200 and the PRESSURE^(TM) makes the man at the the other end get out...,4
Kohli masterclass incoming,5
What's this Intent pls play for NRR,4
Commentator : They sent Sundar over Dube for left right combo in the middle🧐🧐,9
Bc saari same ball daalega kya bhai 😂😂😂,2
Koach is getting angry with all of us comparing him to thala,10

Is it wrong to wish for someone to break Pant's mouth?,2
"Don't care if rcb loses, I want to see kohli's century",11
atleast give us an 8 for that,2
"r/cricket: Looses it's shit when a commentator brings up Dhoni in a non- CSK match

Enough Patels in the DC side to start a few motel chains in the US,8
Kohl's playing Harsha like a spinner lmao,2
A fine ODI innings by Koach so far,5
"Moeen? More like Mo-out, amirite?",3
What the fuck is RCB thinking that they can chase 122 in 8 overs??,3
In flow Kohli is THE best thing in the world to watch.,3
"Only vulnerable thing here is Harshal, RCB would like to exploit it",1
Really weird noise out of my mouth seeing that shot,1
"Rahul, go to bed man. Tomorrow is a weekday",2
"Maarna shuru karo bc, Sharjah nahi hai yeh",4
The only remarkable thing I remember about Harshal Patel is the catch Boult took off his bowling to dismiss Kohli,4
RCB’s lower middle order is pathetic,2
"Of the 7 overs remaining, Rabada and Nortje are gonna bowl 5",3
I love watching the tenseness of the faces in the teams chasing,3
"This sub sure loves suckin on Kohli's imaginary dick. All that hating on KL yesterday and Dhoni even when he doesn't play, sheeeshhhh",2
"alright guys, i am gonna head out now.. 

""Always hope, never expect""

i think this should be our motto...",2
I don't care if RCB lose. I just want to see Kohli bat good,2
so sundars gone from doing next to nothing each game to bowling 4 overs and getting 8 overs to bat??,6
Bc saari ball same to same. Bowling machine saala 😂,2
[I'm something of an Oracle myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j5i7f8/match_thread_19th_match_royal_challengers/g7t003b?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),4
Rabada over after this,1
I am still not sure why the reason to display the profession of the person in those hoardings.,2
"No way RCB is winning this. 

Kohli should play for NRR. But he won't.",4
At least Kohli is getting runs 🤷🏽‍♂️,1
Sundar at 6. Wow. RCB have no batting depth at all,3
Can’t wait for sundar to get out in next 10 balls,3
Why do the teams keep opting to field in this tournament when it hasn't worked well for them?,3
The sound of the bat for that Kohli six. Jeez,6
This game's on big time,3
Am I the only one who doesn’t like Sunil Gavaskar’s commentary??,8
Ati sundar shot,6
literally sunder shot,4
Now we know why Sundar came in at 6,4
Why does Harshal Patel moan after every delivery?,2
So kolhi is gonna have to make a century at the least if RCB wants a chance,3
Axar is playing at Rashid Khan levels rn,4
"The exciting part about this game is Kohli isn't a huge 6 guy, but he has to go for it. And watching the best player in the world play shots he wouldn't normally play is a fun watch",13
Yessss,2
Washi get a 50(20) on your b'day pls,8
Birthday boy strikes it,3
"Sundar looks like he gained Kohli's  trust with bowling now if he performs with his bat he will gain kohlis trust ,which is useful in the next mega auction.",9
Beautiful shot from sundar,5
"Akash Chopra should stop with those cringe ""sundar"" puns 
I had enough",7
So does washy bat left and bowl right,4
Explain why you would not bowl Rabada this over? I am listening.,2
can we change our team name next year?,4
"Everyone who bashed Iyer’s captaincy , of the next 7 overs, Rabada still has 3 overs to go and Nortje’s got 2.",17
Sundar shot #cliche,3
Haarcb with 4 batters on a batting deck. If this isn't brain dead management idk what is.,0
Good.. follow this rrr every over,4
Axar > RKFAS,1
Koach should have played the same winning team here.,0
wtf is that *ati sundar* in background,8
"Kuch toh hai tujhse Rabada 

Kuch toh hai tujhse Rabada

Kaise hum jaane hume kya pata

Kuch toh hai tujhse Rabada",3
"FYI, RCB NRR is the worst. I can't even imagine what will happen after this match",8
Herschelle Patel,2
Axar has improved his game so much,3
[removed],-7
Bowl Rabada next BC,2
Harshal's previous over should've been targeted,3
https://twitter.com/ItsShab07/status/1313122813536948224?s=19,1
inb4 washi plays the greatest ipl innings of all time,2
"You bowl one slow ball, that's a surprise change delivery. Not when every ball you bowl is a slow ball and your fastest ball is 127kmph",2
Come on Koach,3
This is the part where Koach cuts a helpless figure while RCB is in shambles. *Insert DiCaprio pointing meme*,4
Huge over for RCB.,0
Am I the only one who hates this Cred ad and finds it super annoying?,3
5 overs from Nortje and Rabada in the last seven with a RRR of ~15 is going to hard even at Sharjah.,3
These cred are good,0
So what's Kohli's plan? Targetting Rabada and Nortje?,7
"RCB should learn to save ABD's wicket for the last 10 overs during a steep run chase, 

Not send him in inside first 4 overs. Instead send someone like Ali to build an innings.",7
Let's see Washington vs Ashwin yes,2
RCB needs Tewatia and Sharjah stadium..,4
[deleted],2
106 to win in 42 balls. Kohli looking in good shape. In with a chance bois? 🥺,1
Chinnaswamy made our bowling look worse & batting look better than it actually is.,4
It's Sundar's Birthday today. Would love to see him stick with Kohli till the end and finish it.,3
Akash Chopra's commentary man this dude is a clown,4
Kohli sneaked up to 41 and we barely even notice .. genius,3
107 from 42 is getable only if they don't lose another wicket.,2
ABD should be used as finisher now that's for sure,3
Koach gonna end with 120 of 65 balls,1
"Mark my words, Iyer will be future Indian captain.

5 overs with Rabada and Nortje. Good planning.",7
Maar Kohli maar.,2
"Rabada vs Koach

This is what we want to see!!!!",3
Nice to see Rahane again,4
It took me about 15 cred ads to get what the audition reviwer guy was actually saying.,6
Why RCB is still using Bangalore instead of Bengaluru?,3
"Iyer - ""Oh no, Virat is now set and they are gaining momentum...""

&#x200B;

""...anyways, Rabada next over lol get fucked""",21
I want to know how they'll score off Rabada now,2
All these people ridiculing Axar Patel as a 'dart-thrower' clearly haven't been watching too much cricket. He's a really good T20 bowler.,11
Only team that can lose from this position is batting.,5
Virat Kohli going Dhoni way today.,3
Rrr of 15 with Rabada’s 3 figures. There is 0 chance that is happening,3
Altroz,3
Reminder that RCB are playing 4 batsmen on this batting paradise.,9
Koach needs to channel his inner Tewatia. It's now or never.,2
Someone just posted an Altroz ad here lol,6
It's gonna be a bad day for Rabada? Isn't it?,0
It feels like hetmyer is everywhere,7
Is altroz really that good?,1
They'd have a chance if this was RCB's bowling.,2
Rahane Coming in as specialist fielder™️,1
It's not impossible but with 3 overs of rabada is going to be almost impossible,2
Hard to read Kohli. Usually he’s very expressive.,6
RCB being CSK,0
Swann talking about the Altroz sounds like an erotica,3
Gone,4

Chalo bye,3
"At this point, singles and doubles are not going to hurt DC.",6

Hahahhahahhahahha yippeeee,3
Why did Shivam dube was not sent. They need Shivam for this fucking situation,3
Match over for RCB guys...,2
Fuck me,3
Match officially over.,4
Either Star pays a lot of money or Swann genuinely likes that car.,9
Fuck. That's it. Goodnight.,1
Rabada give this man the purple cap already,5
"Oof

Rabada defeats Kohli once again,2

"IYER MASTERCLASS, RABADA BOWLING FIRE LETS GOOOO",5
Koach!!!🥺😳,2

Oh no koach,1
That's the game. RCB's 1% chance has died too,2
this fake crowd is really bias towards rcb,5
"RCB nRR : gone, reduced to atoms.",3
Bubyeeeee,2
"Kohli has completed his Thala transformation. Bat 30 balls at below run a ball, hit a six to give the illusion that he's doing ok, get out immediately after.",8
Kohlapse,3
KG THE MAN,2
Kohli can’t strike,1
"Okay lmao, now it’ll be 109 all out",1
well all hopes on kohli but getting the 1st six in the 13th over is not good when the target is 197.,5
Beautiful stat padding from Koach. Thank you come again.,3
gya Chasemaster™,1
Okay this match would have been over much earlier had they bowled Rabada.,5
HOW THE FUCK  did this DC lose to SRH?,5
F,4
Pant feeling sad for kohli..gg,8
"That's the game, folks.",2
This will keep on happening if Kohli plays test cricket in T20,4
This is Delhi BC!! Lol,5
KAGISSOOOOOO,2
That's the game boys,1
LMAOO AUR NRR WOULD BE GOING NUTS DAMNNNNNNN,2
RCB: NRR? What’s that?,2
"Alright good night lads, well played RCB, cheers.",3
And that's game,2
Time to sleep,3
Rabada has had kohli in his pocket for years,10
 👋 👋 RCB. Your NRR is going to get even worse lmao,7
E sala cup gaand me.,6

"Rabada might be the best thing to happen to us 

Fuck me KG, just fuck me",8
KG is so damn good wowee,8
I feel nothing but pain.,6
NRR is fucked again.,9
That was among the worst innings played by kohli. Very little intent shown considering they are chasing 196 !!!,9
Yeah this fuckin' sucks...fuck,3
lmao,3
Rabada -> Kohli = Kabada,10
"Why did Koach try to be Dhoni here, should have been fearless from the start as always",6
Scotty has been on fire lately,3
Will sleep early today,1
"Okay, I hope Delhi never wins the toss ever again",2
I really hope KG gets paid like the champion bowler he is next year.,4
ok don't lose by huge margin maybe,1
Ashish Nehra can't even pronounce words correctly.,2
"Kohli's purple patch is over. A shade below AB as a limited over batsman and a few notches below SPD Smith as a test batter. A brilliant career when you combine both nonetheless,",7
"Replace the RCB chant with Kagiso, if we have to listen to that shit.",3
NRR is going to be fucked,5
NRR GOES REVERSE STONKS!,4
Oh Kohli...Hope you're back in the 2016 form some day... That was some year...,5
Good night guys... Match over.. Toodles😴😴,0
"**13.3** Rabada to Kohli, OUT,  **94-5**

"Well that’s it, they are going to get bundled up for 130 aren’t they ?",2
ChAsEmAsTeR lolololol,1

Show some killer instincts. You are IPL 2020 champions for fucks sake!!",1
Chejmastur..,1
Katich’s face rn belongs on r/watchpeopledieinside,3
Shaw should run and throw few abuses at him. Koach seems to feel it's okay to do that to fellow teammate.,4
"MI n CSK won. RCB losing this. 

That it fellas. 2020 curse is broken.",12
I fucking said before that kohli will get out by rabada. What am I?Archer??,4
Kohli departs after yet another ODI innings.,4
Dube coming in(chuckles): i am in danger,9
Inb4 Dube 50(10),9
Damn Kohli hasn't pulled a chase for ages.,5

"When RCB loses, they lose so badly it becomes hard to believe that they can win the trophy",11
"Next time Koach wins the toss and bowls first, ima personally fly down and slap him.",14
"Styris: Predicted Rabada was going to bowl this over AND take a wicket 

Swanny: Gets paid to act like a moron on *Dugout*",12
Did dugout showed it's prediction scorecard I missed earlier innings due to work,2
"RCB do not have a quantum of loss protocol do they? It's hit or bust, no in between.",11
Sundar Dube hum,3
Dhoni knows you don’t go for it until the run rate is 18.,34
Same story every fucking season.,8
Played that composed innings just to throw away his wicket so early?,11
"Dube 80(9) incoming. 

RCB NRR +20.78",15
"Shivam Dube to turn into peak Yuvraj now and finish this in 3 overs.. RCB, hope springs eternal",11
That's a wrap,4
Our NRR is gonna be negative three now,6
The chase master tag needs to be reevaluated,4
Delhi Capitals is the best team so far this season,2
Alright guys... GG DC. Good night!,7
I love the dugout banter,2
Save the nrr guys(o´･_･)っ,2
What a selfish innings from Kohli/s,3
"Tbf, atleast Dhoni gets his sr over 140",8
I want Iyer & Ponting combo for future Indian team,6
RCBs NRR is already bad it will become worse today,6
"Wtf, they're promoting altroz even here?",3
Nrr has left the chat,7
Inb4 Udana 85(31)*,9
Rabada is crazy good. Ripping fast with smart brains.,7
Is Ryan Harris the guy in DC dugout?,4

Never unclench for Delhi,7
RIP NRR😣,5
Delhi saving Nortje overs for Saini,15
Get us close bois,2
Taka tak ad has people twerking never saw that on Indian television before.,1
Lmao congrats Rabada on getting on par with Vinay kumar.,3
An ass whopping for ages!!,2
Kagiso Rabada if you read this im free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. Please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I’m free.,7
This fucktard thot it was a good idea to win the toss and bowl first,9
Well we might be LEGIT this year. Hoping the Hyderabad match was just a fluke.,9
[removed],3
Can't expect Dube to save a sinking ship.,2
Did Pommie just compare Rabada with Vinay Kumar? Wtf,3
People getting  mad at rcb batsman but really  it's just hard to bat against nortje and Rabada.,5
Imagine Delhi had Boult too!,3
we’re such a shit team we should be demoted to championship,3
Sickened with the captain & the team. 😣,7
/r/Cricket is obessed with Dhoni and CSK as fanbois and haters. It gets boring tbh.,6
"T20 appears to be getting more and more specialized. As good as Kohli is, it's starting to appear like he isn't really an elite T20 cricketer anymore. Very good, yes. But not his strongest format.",4
Turns out this Shreyas guy is a good captian,10
RCB tail starts after number 4 and people still say they are a good batting side?,1
"Unpopular Opinion: RCB is strategically amiss here. They should try to win this match. IMHO, that's the only way to get 2 points from this match.",8
RCB won’t win unless they get better at auctions.,2
RCB face a wounded Csk next with a point to prove. Things could go south quick,4
There's still hope guys. [Look what Udana did against South Africa at Centurion](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18645/scorecard/1144173/south-africa-vs-sri-lanka-2nd-t20i-sl-in-sa-2018-19),5

Really hope DC have a good season and don't shit the bed like KXIP,5
red teams shitting their pants continues,5
"You gotta assess the pitch based on your team’s strength and weaknesses and what’s most suitable for your side, not look at another team chasing a score with ease and having the mindset to replicate that",2

Why not no nortje and try to close it down wtf,5
"It's been what, about 5 years since last time we saw Kohli getting out on outside off deliveries.. 
It's the spin thag troubled him",3
Delhi are so scary this year. The only way anyone can beat them is if they show lapses in concentration. Sunday's game against them will be so tough for us.,13
"Hope all of this was juuuust because DC is currently the best 2020 team? 

Yeah nah who am I kidding",9
Sundar pls tewatia v2,3

"How are y’all comparing VK to Rahul? Rahul goes at 130 SR when all his teammates go at 170+ in the FIRST innings, costing his team 20 runs off the total.  

Here, VK saved his team from getting bowled out under 100",6
Saini about to get ripped by Nortje,7
Dilliwaalon is this finally our year? Pls say yes,9
They should learn to chase from CSK.,2
Required rate 17.14. Lol,6
"Why do rcb have Hesson AND Katich? Their structure makes no sense, muddled just like the XI",3
This cannot be good advertising for IPL. This is just poor cricket. IPL or otherwise.,3
Scotty vs Swanny leeeettttttzzzzzooooo,1
I want Delhi to win this season so badly,10
 Can Sundar do a Tewatia?,1
Ah man I swear ashwin was so tripe last game. Never saw him bowl worse. Today he's a completely different bowler.,2
CSK at least reach 80% of the chasing score even after tuk tuk but RCB is always way off the chasing score!,-1
Koach ain't no Tewatia.,11
Come on lads book your tickets to Australia this is your chance,3
Kohli won the toss ? Lmao. Sondha kasu la suniyam. T: Shot himself in the foot.,5

Shit I'm a mi fan..... rcb do something!!!!! Don't let DC's nrr cross ours ffs,7
Is KL going to beat Koach’s 973 this year ?,3
"If Harshal Patel bowls anything other than the 20th over here, I don’t even know what to say.",1
Kohli on coke.,1
Ok so they’re definitely playing for the NRR now right?,2
[deleted],4
Should have sent Dube earlier. Good shot.,1
I so want Ashwin to get one more wicket. He’s bowled excellently,2
RCB should have sent out ISRO Udana instead of Sundar. He can launch a few into orbit.,11
Bruh how does rcb make batting look so hard when they conceded fucking 190+,10
Dube bats like Mitchell Johnson lol,1
Missed Finch being warned by Ashwin. Is there a replay of it somewhere?,6
"Why RCB guys panicking, guys rrr is just 10. Smh

*Puts on glasses*

oh it's 18. Nvm",6
"Dube can smack the spinners all he wants, he's going to be clueless against Rabada and Nortje's pace",3
Doobie should’ve been promoted over Moeen. Moeen is rusty playing his first game,2

"Nobody:

Pant: oyyyeee hu huuuuu",7
Man...I rooted for RCB.. Maybe I jinxed it..  this CSK fan jinxed it 😂,4
How do you pronounce Nortje?,5
Just when I had such high hopes for Rcb this season and thought they had found the right balance early they prove me wrong. I thought they will end the dry spell this year and lift the trophy,1
"Next match against Chennai. Yep, not even gonna bother opening the match thread.",9
Below average stats for Kohli in 2020. Law of averages say that he will do well in Australia.,11
Kohli should just open the innings in a chase like this .,3
Drop Finch and open with Sundar,5
"During PP, Nehra was whining Iyer is making a tactical blunder by not giving Rabada & Nortje 2nd over. After Axar & Ashwin got wickets, he was removed for some time. I have never seen making him a right prediction/give good analysis this IPL.",13
"Ahh yes... That familiar feeling of an Ex-RCB player demolishing us, 42-3 in the powerplay, losing by 60 odd runs... This is the Real RCB...",11
Kane Williamson's smile or Pat Cummins' smile?,5
3 runs every ball for 5 overs...ok,4
ಠ⌣ಠ,24
Pant sure is a piece of work.,3
Would be Amazing if these 2 youngsters score 50-60 from here.,3
I am an RCB supporter but I want to bitch slap Saini. That aggression wasn’t needed and his bowling was pedestrian,27
iyers captaincy has been pretty good tbh,18
Washington छछूंदर,9
Reach 150 that might be face saving,6
Rabada looks like he's in constant state of anger,9
MI vs DC final. I wish the final was win 2 out of 3 matches instead of just one match.,8
Wait thats illegal,3
Ashwin is an IPL legend. An average of 26 and economy of 6.8 over 142 matches.,15
Yar Rabada don't lose gas ab yar,4
playing out ashwin when there is Rabada and Nortje waiting lol,4
It's Rabada's way of saying Happy Birthday bowling those deliveries .,5
"Arsenal sign Partey, RCB lose badly... Good day for me.",1
Udana still left to bat ffs. Don't lose gas,3
So dc defeated rcb. Will shreyas get placement in indian cricket team now?,6
VK is too rigid with his line up. Dube/Sundar should’ve been sent ahead of ABD to play a cameo. ABD would’ve taken us home if 50 was required off last 4,5
ಮುಂದಿನ ಸಲ ಕಪ್ ನಮ್ದೆ ಬಿಡಿ.,4
"So realistically, does RCB have playoff chances now? (Their NRR will be quite poor.)",8
I'm perfectly okay with Delhi winning this year as long as Chennai is in the finals with them.,6

RCB collapse is still the most entertaining,5
"How on earth did DC end up with Ashwin, Axar and Amit Mishra !!!! Plus with Rabada and Nortje I dont think any other bowling unit come close. I am slightly mixed on Patel but he did ok in previous game. I would rather have Ishant be ready for Aussie Test series.",15

RCB did RCB today

Rabada equals great fast bowler Vinay Kumar’s record for wickets in consecutive matches. I am sure he will be proud to share the record with Vinay,11

But if RCB don’t make the playoffs this year, y keep him? 4 consecutive years without making it into playoffs.",10
Lmao wtf is going on in the dugout. Why is Swann running around like an aeroplane 😂,10
Swann has done like 13 shots already and still hanging around the bar. That's the only explanation I have,3

[It all started because of the Replacement Killer](https://ibb.co/mHyCMPJ),5
To think Nortjes only came in as replacement to Woakes. Blessing in disguise to Delhi,17
Dube should at least try going all out,3
Nokia and Rabada are never going to concede 100 runs in 6 overs. RCB had to go against the spinners. Poor planning.,10
"I have been claiming this year could be turnaround year for RCB...

But even 2020 cannot help colossal fuck up..",6
Having 2 op fast bowlers should be illegal. DC just look too good this year. What a team,10
DC playing for strong NRR,6
"Lol Commentators calling Dube the tail, he is India’s premier limited overs allrounder right now FFS",1
This tournament needed a better class of champions and we will give it to them!,10
"For me Nortje has been the find of the tournament, obviously lot of Indian youngsters are splendid and much more deserving of that tag, but he man he throws down some missiles",20
And I thought our middle order batting is shit. This is even worse,11
We needed a guy like Stoinis to win yesterday's match. One who is capable of leaving those wide deliveries and play the ones that fall inside the line.,5
"After initially stuttering, RCB back to what they're good at.....losing matches.",6
Nokia and Rabada will win SA alot of games,9
STOINIS for an over!,4
Nortje 👏👏,3
DC truly are an illegal team this year,9
anyone know which team had the worst start possibly and made the playoffs?,4
92 off 5 overs. Mumbai and a couple of other teams (KKR) at least come close. What is this. Pedestrian,6
Rabada you sexy beast.,4
Didn't know Udana bats right handed. Don't remember him batting for SL at all. Doesn't he bat at 10/11?,3
***RABADA***,5
man i think we need to stop chasing. i feel this team will either chase 160 with ease or completely shit the bed when chasing anything higher,11
"Dube has not had too many decent knocks barring that one fifty he scored against West Indies last year. And that came against a very average attack. I don't think his batting is reliable or destructive enough for him to be considered a batting all-rounder or a finisher. He just can whack the ball at times, that's all. Pretty overrated atm, he's a dead duck versus good bowling.",8
Any merit to philippe opening over finch? Finch has been extremely scratchy every time he's batted this ipl and he's struggling to hit the ball.,3
Rabada 6fer incoming?,6
RABADA is on FIRE!,3
They should give stoinis the ball when saini comes in,7
Rabada What a BIG DICK Wicket taker!! Take a bow!!,5
Thats illegal,3
/r/DeathRattlePorn,9
Rabada - It is free real estate,4
"All the snobby Englishmen who are like ""aShWin LeArnT fRom hIS MIstaKe"" FUCK YOUUU",14
"Clean bowled, bye bye. Send Saini. DC bowlers have something to say to him.",11
Can we never let rabada go pls,7
"Questionable chase by Kohli tbh, seemed like the Dhoni template of playing sedately no matter the bowler in the middle overs.",4
"I know everyone talks about Rabada but what a find Nortje has been for DC.
 Absolute gun fast bowling pair.",8
FUCK MY ASS,5
Chintu bc,2
"**17.1** Rabada to Dube, OUT,  **118-7**

S Dube  b Rabada 11 (12b 0x4 1x6) SR: 91.66",1
"Are Dube bhai, you could have played for NRR at least. It is already -0.95",3
Rabada my boyyyyyyy,2
Guys did Koach show intent?,3
At least with KXIP they change things and admit their concept/idea for the team failed. The buffoons at RCB just try to sweep things under the rug by merely saying this was a bad year and next year things will click.,1
RCB are back. Finally the IPL returns to normal.,5
Saini having a terrible day. I have a good feeling about this.,1
Rabada to Saini Beamer incoming,1
"This will..uumm... harm rcb's nrr, right?",3
I don’t know why everyone is shitting on Dube. He’s in the team for his death bowling. Batting is a bonus.,2
This is our best chance in years to win all this. It'll be years of agony if we don't go all the way this time,2
Dube played a solid tail ender.,3
"I hope Dc carries on the form, don't want a repeat of 2012",5
Scenes if Saini comes and Stoinis bowls to take his revenge,3
"Delhi is excellent team but still not sold on their chasing ,they usually implode like anything.",2
"Oh hatrick ball, bowl a bouncer",1
"Only RCB when loses, loses this badly",3
Questioning Ashwin’s ethics!,2
Is..is this...is this our year?,1
Nokia will be priority next year above Chris woaks,3
Man this Delhi opening attack of Rabada and Nortje is just fire.,2
What’s going on?,2
Stoinis bowling to Saini is what I'm looking forward to,3
Rabada is just 25 years old. Already a legend. DC should never let him go.,8
"Cricinfo guy just burnt someone in the comms

Edit: 
""Sid, you really can't blame Kohli, RCB spinners were 5-0-50-1 and with all the misfields and dropped catches, he had very little options to bowl them out anyway. DC have been excellent on field and their batters selected their shots well."" Vysakh, you have got to look at what the ball was doing. It turned square for Sundar, who bowls darts. Chahal should be trusted. His one expensive over came in the Poweprlay. And well done on cherry-picking stats and not counting Sundar as a spinner",1
What's happened?,2
What went wrong for RCB? Captaincy. You left 3 spin overs on the table. You failed to attack opposition spinners being one of the best players of spin.,6
"I want to age with Pant, Iyer, Shaw, Rabada and Nortje in my team.",3
Iyer should give an over to Stoinis if shaini comes and survives this over just for the kicks.,4
"The moment all the Cricbuzz *pundits* picked RCB, I knew it was a good omen.",7
Nortje was a replacement for Woakes. What a blessing in disguise for DC.,20
Sometimes I just want to see KKR play both Lockie and Cummins.,5
Atleast there is someone else competing for wooden spoon with us...,2
Rabada please save Saini for Stoinis lol I'd love to see the contest,4
"People blaming saini for that beamer do you'll really think he intended to hit stoinis ?. Yes wale idiots




.Edit :- he didn't apologize.  Bad sportsmanship still it doesn't mean it was intentional",0
rabada to saini. things could get spicy,3
Haha I shoulda seen this coming,5
"Dubey did a Tewatia in reverse, anyways once a RCB supporter always a RCB supporter.",3
"CSK should lose the matches so that RCB can win the IPL. 

The hardest choices requires the strongest will.",0
Futile discussion by umpires. Ashwin wrote the book on ethics. The ring is where Ashwin stands.,16
Can not decide from that!,2
"Fuck off here, ethics won't allow him to bowl no ball. Piss poor umpires, ask after the match is over. Haat bc",2
rcb doesn't need to take off their jerseys to reveal it was rcb all along!!!,3
"Ashwin was outside the circle, he loses the moral right to Mankad anyone for an year, he is a cheater himself",-3
What are they checking?,1
ethical mind😡,1
Classy umpiring here.,2
I don’t care I wanna see DC in the finals,7
"My prediction, RCB continue to chop and change, they will bring in Zampa for Udana next match.",10
"DC's core is strong. They will retain Iyer, Pant and Rabada next year (if its mega auction year) and use RTM for Shaw and Nortje/Mishra",10
How is Nortje pronounced?,1
Bump him Kagiso. Go for the head,9
"Damn, Rabada has 45 wickets in just 24 matches in the IPL!",11
"Rabada is good no doubt but I think Nortje complements him well. Last season it was only Rabada. This season, it’s like the opponent has only 12 overs to play with because these 2 just don’t give out anything!",9
Get on with it.,3
Saini: why you bully me,4
Going for Saini’s head for Stoinis!,6
[removed],8
The cameraman literally missed it KP ffs,2
KG sacrificing his hat-trick for Stoinis revenge. Lol,6
Hahaha good on ranada to not gone for the wicket. Good priorities. Loved iyers laugh,3
"RCB next match will be crucial. If they lose it , I will be 100 % sure they are not qualify this year also.",2
My man ash tried to give away his cap some free NRR.,4
"Yeah, bowl some bouncers to Saini. Show him how to scare the batsman LEGALLY",2
Looks like Ashwin got away with a warning,2
Bring on stoinis now,3
ethical mind™ can never break rules,5
Lmao almost fucked Saini up,4
"**When you only have three decent players in team, this is bound to happen.**

Padikkal: 5/10

Finch: 5/10 

**Kohli: 8.5/10**

**ABD: 6.5/10**

Moeen: 5/10

Dube: 3/10

4 fer!,2
I think that’s fine. Don’t need to make this like the offside shenanigans of EPL,4
Post match thread is not created yet?,11
Damn this is supposed to be the quickest format. So many stoppages.,8
Wtf what happened!?,0
6-fer incoming,2
should’ve happened the last ball dammit,2
Lmao Brett Lee indirectly called Dube a tailender 😂,9
"Fielders usually take a few steps walk in as the bowler is running in and releases the ball.

It's normal habit of all fielders where they take a few steps in as the bowler is running in.",2
The ethics are beyond our understanding.,4
Atleast Purple cap ain't going from one head to another for few days,3
Anyone know what makes rabada so good in the death?,8
Rabada said fuck that hattrick. I want to end this serial beamer guy Saini..,38
I am digging this new jersey.,5
God this is getting more embarrassing for RCB.,4
Rabada is a cheat code,8
"Well bowled Rabada, got 3 wickets in 4 balls and a bouncer to cunt. Impressed",13
At least they ain't playing for bs net run rates. Proper tailender batting.,5
So RCB is just gonna stat pad Rabada now... I see that as an absolute win,10
Hell yeah we'll win,3
RCB gifting the purple cap to Rabada,13
RCB didn't even play for NRR .. so disappointing for others,8
"4D thinking by Saini to get out before Stoin comes anywhere near him


Edit : I'm an idiot.. Saini's still here",8
"Me: * very tensed *

\* Rabada smiles *

Me:   :) 

Something very wholesome about him",15
W,1
5fer in T20 would be epic and well deserved for Kagiso Rabada.,3
First 4-fer of this season by a bowler.. Rabada is such a lethal weapon for DC,6
Rabada is amazing,1
That sweet NRR,1
5fa please,1
Udana chahte the gend ko uda de - Sunny G,5
What's with people shitting on Saini? Missed most of first innings,3
"**17.3** Rabada to Udana, OUT,  **119-8**

I Udana c Iyer b Rabada 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33",1
almost hat-trick fucks sake! king RABADA,6
"This IPL has shown that a lot of batsmen are simply uncomfortable against raw pace. Now that Bhuvi is injured and SRH’s middle order showing some sort of form, it might be a good idea to bring in Stanlake for Williamson.",14
Next over please Stoinis,3
Damn who took the wickets? Rabada? Ashwin?,2
Ashwin having his number taped out is the most village thing I’ve ever seen.,8
"Thank God Dominic Cork is going to be joining the Dugout, hoping this means less of Bangar from now onwards ffs",5
With Ashwin there's always some drama lol,15
Feel so conflicted. Wanted delhi to win but this big of a loss 2nd time would more or less kill koach from the inside.,12
Lord Siraj save us,5
It's not a mistake. Ashwin never make mistakes. He don't do random. There's always an objective. Always a target.,29
[removed],6
feels bad man,3
"""Ayy chutiyon cup nahi Jeet sakte toh Mera purple cap at least jeetade te"" 

-Chahal in RCB dressing room probably",13
Ash must be fuming. Batsman was allowed to go out of the crease. But he starts out of the circle and they start checking....,35
"Hahaha love his smile,  lmao koach looking sad",7
[deleted],-26
Heartbreak again.,5
Rcbs run rate will take another massive hit today,9
Remember Rabada took 4 fer against RCB last season al well. RCB always brings the best out of opposition's big players.,27
"im sorry srh fans i called your team shit, we take that crown back",26
"It's RR winning tomorrow, you saw this here first",7
"Haven't seen the last match, what happened between Watson and Rahul?",7
Ah fuck I wanted rabada to take a fifer,7
Would be a 5-fer if he held onto that finch catch,7
Stoinis PLEASEEEE,3
RCB don’t want to complete their 20 overs.,2
Bring Stoinis pls,8
Kkr cannot be at top of the fair play awards with Dk not playing fair towards his own team,33
Why can't we get that top down camera angle for every catch?,7
KG is such a wholesome lad. He smiles like a little kid.,15
Pain,5

- 2 decent and fast openers
- good solid middle order

"Watson and KL had an argument yesterday?

Both of them were smiling when talking to each other though",5
"Why? 198 is not impossible, and we've got world class batters. Why?",14
"Rip RCB nrr, don't give up yet though. I still believe that RCB can make it to the top four of this edition when it ends",8
Mah boi Harshal getting ready to give away some nrr for RCB,8
Rabada I love you,8
I am glad my favorite international players wont leave early this time for their international games.,12
"Im glad we lost today tho, again shit decision to chase",6
"Tbf Our losses were painful while watching but would choose Thala's NRR saving,  Quantum of Loss decreasing chases over total collapses anyday.",15
Wtf koach won the toss and chose to chase lol,25
Rabada for 4.2 Crores ffs. Cummins makes 15.5 . Archer makes 8. Jadhav makes 8,39
Ponting trying to copy in the test.,9
Guys! I'm starting to feel RCB will not win this match.,12
"I just remembered, wasn't Harshal Patel absolute shit when he was in the RCB?",5
Ab wearing a jacket in that heat lmao wtf,6
A wild boundary out of nowhere,1
RCB's batting blows so hot and cold. Either they go big or completely gets knocked out. No in between.,4
Ricky Ponting is a serial winner,6
 A Boundary holy shit!,1
Don't see anyone in RCB taking notes. That's the difference,7
Inshallah boys pride-d well today,2
"Okay this win would've been a huge boost. But we're still in this
Our record is similar to Mumbai now, but just white a shite nrr",3
If only Mark Wood gets named as replacement for Mishra. Delhi would have perfect backup for these  quicks.,2
Can we just give the ball to Stoinis please 😂,1
Saini rips off his mask to show that it was Umesh all along!,11
How did Delhi Memedevils transform into such a good team? Ponting? Investment in youth?,2
"Kohli being a champion player himself, demands a team of champions as a captain. Sachin Tendulkar was the same as a captain. Both ignore  limitations.
Dada, Dhoni and Rohit to a certain extent are the opposite. They have a knack of building teams with limited talents but max effect.",18
"I just noticed so asking, is the DC uniform in support of LGBT?",6
rRR has scored 50.,2
No sympathy for these clowns. Just lamenting our loss against them. Shame Marsh got injured.,6
Low-key Nortje has been pretty good too,2
"Koach is not an X Factor in T20. Not anymore. 
Even if he gets runs nowadays, 120-130 strike rate is hardly sufficient in steep run chases. 

ABD is the only run machine/X Factor. They should save his wicket for the end during run chases and not waste it at the top.",7
let’s fucking go nortje. you beautiful bastard,2
DC got nokia for how much in replacement?,2
That was due,1
DO NOT CHASE AT DUBAI !,7
Not a single beamer from DC bowlers ... surprise mothafuckas.,12

Wooooo whatta zipper,2
"Ponting drawing boobies in that notebook, I know him very well. 😉",10
Saini on strike. Would be perfect if Stoinis was given the ball.,3
"

Rcb should send someone else at 4 instead of devillers if they loses early wickets.

Devillers in before 6 overs puts a lot of pressure to him and rcb has no other player like devillers and Kohli who plays so well in depth.",9

Siraj stretching more than batting,2

Delhi Capitals look pretty balanced amongst all teams this season.. Good Batting line up with Great options for both spin & fast bowling.. I hope they reach playoffs this year.,6
Dube deserves to lose his place as a batsman for that performance. Looked clueless. Its the last batsman’s job to push for a respectable score.,6
Not gay,0
Bowl stoin u cunts,3
Bhai where is siraj going,8
Siraj having more SR than Padikkal. Send him to open the next match.,11
Is Nokia an aussie. What a jem,3
Hey what happened to Mishra Ji?,2
Saffas could win the T20 WC if their players keep this form (and learn to destroy their gag reflex so that they stop choking),8
Siraj's SR > Koach's SR,4
They’ve left too much for Chahal to do.,4
"CSK: The only way we're getting into the playoffs this year is if we have a good NRR

RCB: Arre kyun tension le raha hai, main hoon na",10
why did they decide to chase🙄🙄🙄🙄,4
Why bowl Patel when they could have had STOINIS. :v,5
"All are saying It's 2020 and rcb can win and all that.  But honestly I supported rcb when I was 2 years old.  And this team will every year disappoint fans. Just not buying a good death bowler.  Buying morris for 10 cr when we need a gun death bowler.  Buying finch for 5 cr when we don't need him. Parthiv performed well last season.  And he can also solve problems with AB keeping. Just its fucking annoying.  I know it's only 5 games until now but is annoying. We may have won 3 out of 5 but its done. Not buying any middle order batsman. It's done man. Kohli is the captain from 2013 and the team has only qualified in 2015 and 2016. You can downvote me. But they have to be the worst team.  Two matches where we gag to chase 190+ and guess what, it was a fucking collapse both times. This is just a boom or bust type of team.  The only positive is padikkal. And this sums up most of the times teams do. The mantra to win the ipl is just to get a good team in the mega auction. DC were shit till 2018 and now they're the most balanced team with Mumbai. It's just done.",6
Lol Siraj,2
Bruh they got creamed,2
Are the shoulder stripes on DC jerseys some LGBT thing?,3
Village cricket by Siraj,4

Every performance of RCB this year is some kind of peak RCB.,14

Stoinis would have bowled better ffs,8
Will Samson do well tomorrow? Or is he done for the IPL as is customary,10
It'd be interesting to see what happens  if DC says it is for LGBT support.,11

RCB reverting back to type.,6
 ┻━┻︵ \\(°□°)/ ︵ ┻━┻,26

The South African bowling duo has been exceptional for DC so far,16
RRR 366,5
DC vs RR at Sharjah 💥,7
"Required runrate is 366, we can still do it",13
Kohli is really brain dead with the toss idea,7

RCB didn't lose 10 wickets — Moral victory.,21

I really hoped RCB would give a fight in the chase. Even 2020 can’t change their fortunes,3
Harshal helping RCB with the NRR since RCB can't help themselves,11
At least RCB didn't get bowled out,7
Logged off for a client call and came back now. WTF VK!! We are ok with having one MSD,8
Fuck you all we didn't get all out.,11
Win by 59 runs =S,2
RCB vs KXIP at Sharjah would be fun,3
How many wickets have Nortje taken? Must be atleast 5. Right?,5

Not just happy we won but also because we're getting better and better every game. We're learning from our previous games and plugging the gaps. All this looks very encouraging.,24
Our NRR will be so shit now LMAO,7
"Only way RCB can get rid of meme team by changing their name just like Delhi did, It's not about mega Auction, etc. Change the name and see it all coming together",12

Finch has to warm the bench. Underwhelming return from him so far. It’s almost a given about the result once AB & Kohli got out. The middle order is nonexistent,11
nice to see the youngest captains of this ipl humbling koach,17
Yay for the NRR.,3
"Okay fire up the the ""we can still qualify"" machine",13

What an masterclass in chasing by Kohli,8
"KXIP, do you need any more proof that a name change does indeed work out well?",13

Did koach eat his mustache on his left in anger.,14
"Is it me or is the cricinfo commentator getting very defensive? Someone was sending in their comment on Kohli not bowling their spinners and the dude just replied snarkily back...and this isn't the first time I'm seeing this either. Earlier they just used to publish comments from the readers and maybe throw in a joke or two but they never agreed or disagreed with them. Now I'm seeing them taking sides; don't know if it's the same person though

Or am I reading it wrong?",9
Kagiso's voice matches his manly name.,9
"Rabada is so smiley and cute, who'd think he'd be a ferocious fast bowler.",13
Fair to say that Kohli isn't going to get too many Gillette sponsorships with that left dominant mustache.,18
Damn KG's voice does not match his boyish face,6
Yes blame it on bowlers but not on your batsmen n your decision to bowl first.,11
Rabada sounds exactly like Faf... its uncanny!,6
Only RCB can play for NRR and still fail spectacularly.,17
This post match interview is straight out of Dhoni’s book,10
"Kohli: I batted sensibly to improve NRR.

But our NRR is worse than ever

Kohli: Did I stutter?",31
"Rabada took the previous beating personally, i have no complaints though",12
How did srh win against DC again?,17
Rabada looks like an obedient cute little son who is closer to his mother.,18
"Obligatory ""Axar is so underrated"" post. But seriously, how do you not credit this guy?",13
Kohli will blame his Philips trimmer now for his moustache just like he blamed his bowlers,19
This match has been a great lesson for all of us. It shows that Apollo pipes is better than Astral pipes.,34
CSK fans count in a thread when rcb losing >>>> CSK fans # when csk winning,20
"Kohli so stressed out, he's started to pull his moustache hairs",18
"Rabada, Nortje, Ashwin, Axar = 16 overs, 90 runs, 9 wickets among them. What a team effort!!",32
Man Rabada gaming no credit for how well he did for this team.,14
"""Chris was really close to playing today as well but couldn't make it. We have four days to the next game, once he comes back into the squad it is a different balance altogether. ""

Is Morris still not available??",8
RCB's negative run rate looks equal to everyone else's negative run rate combined.,39
"DC Bowlers: **Rabada, Nortje, Ashwin**, *Axar, Harshal, Stoinis*

RCB Bowlers: Siraj, Saini, Dube, *Sundar*, **Chahal**",24
RCB played a brilliant innings to avoid follow on,23
This is still one of the best starts to a season for Rcb,10
I know Steyn went for runs against kxip but he’s a world class bowler and can comeback strong and boost the bowling unit,10
Maybe RCB need to change the color of their uniform... maybe replace red and gold with Kingfisher colors or something..,16
How did RCB lose despite all the firepower?,13
Iyer is fun and chill dude. I thought he will behave like koach. Nice to see him having fun with his players and making jokes on him.,21
Again Kohli will find himself being trolled on Twitter,19
"Axar getting MotM, good to see bowler getting it over batsman",16
Class humour from Shreyas,19
Iyer is so chill. Like the dude a lot. Can see the camaraderie with his team. Whoever made him DC captain deserves kudos.,37
ABD needs to take the role of captaincy from Kohli,4
Who was that trying to finger Iyer with the microphone?,10
At this point ABD needs to become the captain of RCB,13
Twitter's a shitstorm right now,13
"Umm, so Axar is going to thank his captain in the dressing room now :D",8
"Whatsup with kohlis team generator. Almost feel bad for moin, gets 1 game and then makes way for Morris. On the other hand MSD keeps his trust in Watson and gets paid well. If only kohli stuck with steyn till now.",13
Yesterday we saw vintage CSK today it's vintage RCB Bois,60
RCB please go back to the Red and Golden jersey,21
BC Iyer said he will take 4 out of 5 wins anyday. It ruined our invincible season!!,25
I feel like Marnus Labuschagne should play in IPL and RCB should buy him.,8
"Rabada ,Nortje are the best bowlers in Ipl but they failed in the Wc 19?Morris and Plessis and co all failed against India in Wc 19?How?Their player's batting and bowling is so good in Ipl?",6
