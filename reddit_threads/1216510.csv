I do think Hetmyer should be persisted with but DC can hardly go wrong giving Rahane a shot. He just needs to know what role it is that they want out of him and then execute accordingly. Doubt Ponting is going to tolerate him coming out at 1 down and batting at 110 SR. But I think he is capable of a lot more.",6

He is not getting enough rest and as a result is not pumped up in the field. As a consequence he is not putting undue pressure on his players to perform at his level. He is more like ‘meh, whatever’. So his players without the burden of expectations are doing alright. And they have only Sunny G to thank for it. Thoughts ???",35

Virat went back to her and told her she might have overreacted a bit. They had a huge fight. Virat has been sleeping on the couch ever since (Koach on couch situation). He is not getting enough rest and as a result is not pumped up in the field. As a consequence he is not putting undue pressure on his players to perform at his level. He is more like ‘meh, whatever’. So his players without the burden of expectations are doing alright. And they have only Sunny G to thank for it. Thoughts ???",6

Is Finch really needed for RCB? 

Parthiv was doing decent enough as Opener. Had 140+ SR in his last 2 seasons with 27+ avg. in both season.

Finch in IPL tho is always less impressive than his T20I heroics and had a horrid last season(2018) averaging 17 and this year he's averaging 27 and striking at 121. 

Reason am saying this is, now ABD has been forced to keep which will be disastrous for RCB in the long run.

Once Morris is available he could replace Finch imo.",7
