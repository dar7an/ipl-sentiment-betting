Bit early that,1
If Kane isn‚Äôt playing I‚Äôm supporting RR this season.,54

"So if SRH wins comfortably, CSK will be at the bottom of the table?

Changing my flair to SRH rn",8
Frontbencher vs Backbencher,6
"As much as I would like to believe that we are favourites here, years of being a Delhi fan has taught me to expect the worst.

Plus Warner is too much of a champion player to lose three on the trot.",6
"I have confidence but definitely not entirely convinced with our batting performances so far.

The first game we needed a Stoinis miracle & KXI bottling the game to pull us out of certain defeat.

Second one we dropped the ball whilst batting in the death overs, but excellent bowling won us the game.

Hopefully we see our batters in some explosive form today.

P.S. : Hope Kanos plays and performs really well in a losing SRH effort.",2
"We've had two exhausting days of cricket, I sense a boring game today.",5
"SRH should have retained Pathan and Hooda, they gave a false sense of confidence to the Top order that there are big hitters to come, though they very rarely brought out the big hits for SRH and were as poor as their current middle order, but at least the top order batted in much more relaxed state of mind",6
[deleted],5
"So approx. 35 minutes until we find out that SRH are not playing Kanos, and have opted to lose.",3
"Today seems to be a good day to have a Warner-Bairstow masterclass. I'm conflicted who to root for though. If SRH win, it is better for the tournament buttttt CSK will likely be pushed to the bottom of the table.",9
Probable team changes for today? Are Ash & Ish fit? Is kanos playing?,2
"Not that other SRH middle order players were any better, but Kanos couldn't really get going last year.

His innings: 14, 3, 3, 8\*, 13, 14, 3, 70\*, 28",3
"It's promising to see the Delhi unit coming together over the years. Finally the CSK and MI model bearing fruit. 

Hope they don't show the brain dead planning in the next major reshuffle as they have done in the past.",5
Hopefully Hetmyer gets a good innings today,1

"I'd drop avesh for Harshal patel, avesh bowls a lot of pies",1

My favourite team vs my least favourite team.,1
"Unpopular opinion as always but Rashid Khan‚Äôs spot needs to be looked at closely. He‚Äôs cost the franchise 9 Crores and an overseas spot. For someone costing that much money and keeping out Kane Williamson, he needs to perform head and shoulders above the other spinners in the competition. It‚Äôs not enough that he simply bowls at 6.5 RPO. Even average spinners do that. He needs to be able to deliver for the team in the power play and even death, and be a strike bowler, similar to how Ashwin was for CSK back in 2011. 
 
Like Narine, he essentially provides no batting utility as he gets out to any remotely high quality bowling. Several analysts were looking for KKR to drop Narine. Why is Rashid any different?",3
Expecting a great day for SRH pacers today,4
Abdul samad in for srh,3
Yo does Trevor got a thing against kiwis or smth?,1
[deleted],1
"I swear if Kane is benched too much, he might just demand to get transferred to another team as Dhawan did. Then we‚Äôll get a couple of crappy India players in return.",7
"More about [Abdul Samad](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/29023354/profile-big-hitting-jk-batsman-ipl-signing-abdul-samad), tonight's debutant for SRH.",3
"I actually don‚Äôt see which other team would play Kane regularly if he was with them. Maybe Punjab or Delhi in place or Pooran/Hetmyer? CSK for Watson? But no one is really dying for Williamson in their squad imo. Now that teams are getting set, not even sure who stands to benefit seriously from getting him.

I say this as someone who is a big Kanos fan and believes he‚Äôs almost as good or as good a T20 player as someone like Kohli. Just feel like there‚Äôs no shortage of class batsmen.",-5

Ishant is back! Great news for Delhi that.,5
"Kane is in.

Kane is in.

Kane is in.",5
KANE AND ISHANT BACK,3
Kane‚Äôs back!,3
Time for Kane Bois finally,3
"KANOS IS IN

AJSHWHWUAKSA

ALL ABOARD THE KANE TRAIN",2
Kane inplace of nabi? Lol,3
Oh god finally Kane is in or U was about to go sleep and wake up around 10 pm ist,1
KANEEEE FUCK YEAHHH,2
Kanos is playing. ‚ù§Ô∏è,3
Is this the ground with joke boundary length?,3
Finally Kane is playing,8
ALL ABOARD,6
Kanosüòçüòçüòç,5
Warner-Bairstow 300 partnership incoming. You heard it here first.,7
A Davey 100 before bedtime pls,5
God is back. Game on.,5
[deleted],32
"Glad to see Ishant back

Tons of Kane hype as well, inb4 underwhelming performance (yes I know he hasn't played for a while but still funny innit)",3
Would've stopped supporting SRH if they had dropped Kane for this match too,7
Kanos is gonna snap his fingers.,2
"kane and samad back in! yes, yesss, YESSS!",1
Abdul Samad the 19 year old J&K batsman is in the team,5
"Kanos üòç

Why my pp suddenly big",13
"Kane is love, kane is life. Al aboard kane train üöÜ",31
Thank goodness Kanos is in. One of the best in the business.,2
The last two days have given my heart quite a workout; will it happen again tonight?,1
"Nabi left out against a side that has 4 left-handers in the top 7.







Who is taking these decisions at SRH?",6
I don't understand why you'd still opt to field after seeing how the past games went,2
"More hyped for Samad. He's been my Dark Horse ever since the auction. In Pant's voice, ""Lezzzz Gowwwww""",4
"Without Vijay Shankar, Abhishek Sharma now has to bowl 4 overs. Kane himself might be forced to roll his shoulders for a couple of overs.",3
YJB munched too many pies during lockdown,4
Feels like today can only be a let down after two of the best T20s I‚Äôve seen in a while back to back. Can never complain about having YJB on my screen though so looking forward to this one!,9
Nice to see Abdul Samad make the team. Possibly only the third player from J&K to play in the IPL. Almost gave J&K the first innings lead against Karnataka in the Ranji QF.,6
Let's go DC... knock SRH out.,-7
Score predictions please!,1
So Abdul Samad is a batting allrounder who bowls legspin. I think he should get a try with the ball also. A lot of leg spinners are very successful when they first bowl because batsmen take time to get used to their action.,6
"excited to see abdul samad bat 
 
watched some of his videos on youtube and he really hits some effortless sixes",4
why aren't more neutrals supporting sunrisers? :( isnt it better for the tournament for sunrisers to win today? keep things interesting?!,5
Wishing for J&K's Abdul samad to do well. Will have some positivity in the region.,6
Sometimes it‚Äôs painfully obvious how popular two teams are based on the number of comments in these threads lol,55
Really hope Samad does well today. India really does lack some big hitting middle order batsmen.,7
"Phew Kane is playing 

Kanos be like ""I'm... inevitable.""",7
"Fuck ..why does ishant have to play when we are the opponents..  


rabada and ishan...",7
Kanos playing through the season might make him an MVP! He can dig in and pierce the gaps when the pitches slow down in the next half,6
Bowling is very very weak but screw it since Kane is back. Hope he performs and becomes a permanent fixture in the team.,3
"How scared are these cricketers to set a target?

It is embarrassing to say the least. They have seen most teams lose while trying to chase.",1
"Delhi is too Op,The only time they might fail is the knockouts since they are a bit inexperienced",12
Rabada has been wicketless only in 2/20 IPL games he's played. Last time he was wicketless was 16 games ago. He's taken 2+ wickets in his last 9 games.,2
Barstow looking like a henchman from any action movie,5
Imagine choosing to field even though almost all the teams that chose to field lost,4
"SRH team looks like those RCB teams with Gayle, Kohli and ABD at the top, no middle order and only one competent bowler.",67
A lot is riding on Rashid to finish the game.,5
"Srh bowling looks litl weak now

Abishek sharma shud bowl 4 overs

They cud have played nadeem",3
"rabada, nortje, sharma, mishra and axar. and ash when he's back. stacked bowling.",9
All neutrals are supporting thier usual points table neighbors.,6
This thread is dead man. Hopefully the match isn't,11
It's actually funny how nobody cares about this match,-4
"Should have kept Nabi instead of Rashid:

1) Proper batting finisher

2)Opposition would be willing to take risks against Nabi. Their goal is to typically avoid Rashid as much as possible. With Nabi at least they can be tempted.",2
Time to make some biryani out of these SRH players tonight üòã,-1
Quick question : is it okay to shit on CSK if H'bad boys win?,6
"DC does seem like the most balanced team this season, I think their biggest obstacle might be relative inexperience.",9
"Honestly not getting a proper Indian opener after letting Dhawan go was a big mistake from SRH. I get how good these two are but it totally messes up the balance. Hopefully for SRH, Garg develops well and can add some strength.",6
hopefully the match is not like that saturday sleepfest.,12
[deleted],-10
its chhole vs biryani tonight!,7
"I've been an ardent Hyderabad fan since 2008. Feels shit to support SRH after ages. With Kane coming back, I hope there's a change in momentum.",8
I am team Rabada..,4
MI and CSK would be praying on one leg for SRH. Never thought we will see this day,7
Is tonight the night The Hulk finally rips out of his shirt like it's tissue paper!?,8
"If Ishant will be able to swing the ball for Warner from round the wicket, it will be fun to see.",2
One big advantage of hosting matches in UAE is that you don't have to worry about rain.,6
"Oh no, we won the toss... That's been such a bad omen this season....",2
Rooting for DC but my boi Kane Williamson‚Äôs playing today ü•∫,4
Go get them boys!,3
Yay Kane Willaimson is playing but oh no SRH only have 5 bowlers.,2
"Kane is back y'all

Nabi was still very good though. Wish we could field 5 foreign players",5
"Who are the 5 bowlers for SRH, I saw only 4",4
Is Harsha commentating today?,3
SRH need to back Yusuf Pathan even if he's inconsistent he is  a big hitter,0
SRH has the shortest and the most competent batting lineup I have ever seen.,6
DC gonna choke today. SRH posting 180+ and DC lineup will falter,8
"Wish I had drinks, would take a shit every time SRH shit the bed.",4
Hope SRH scores 110 and defends it just for the memes,8
How did the points table get reversed?ü§î,8
Graeme what you smoking bruh,3
Upvote this thread or Jesus will be angry with you,3
I‚Äôve been supporting Delhi the past few matches because of the Rabada-Nortje partnership but Kane‚Äôs tempting me to support the Sunrisers.,2
Hope SRH shows some INTENT.,5
"No matter what is the result, Rabada has been such a gem for Delhi. They better retain him for next mega auction.",4
Genuine question. Why can't Rashid be dropped? He's a wicket taker alrightbut Nabi's the more economical bowler and better batsman and he's *coughs* older and more experienced.,4
"Instead of out batting lineup finishing after 3, it finishes after 4.",6
"Lee: We're in for an absolute cracker.

"I see more RCB fans than SRH fans, guys go home our match is over!",6
"you could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? back to me

Why is CricketMatchBot supporting RCB?,2
Very happy with Kane's return. Hopefully our middle order get some runs.,5
"Kanos is in today , hope he gets going",6
Oh shit I just realized Ishant is playing in a team coached by Punter,10
Scenes if Kanos scores 700+ again but without playing 2 matches,6
Scenes if SRH is 4/3 in 2 overs.,4
Rahane would make it to any teams starting XI except Delhi smh,-1
Wow this thread really is dead today.,2
Hope kanos comes at 3,1
Scenes if the serial downvoter is back,-1
Really fancy YJB to go very unacademy today,2
"Ah, I‚Äôve finally figured out what I want. Kane to score a big century and Rabada and Nortje winning the game for Delhi like they‚Äôve done thus far. At least that gives me hope that our cricketing future won‚Äôt be complete shit with all the shit being thrown around now.",3
SRH please win today and let Watson score in next match pls,1
I see that Anrich Nortje is applying for Australian citizenship under the bogan fast-track process.,1
"Really like DC's tradition of choosing a different player to give the huddle speech every match, it's only symbolic but shows they're willing to listen from everyone and are inclusive",2
"This is embarrassing, we're getting memed by RCB fans. Like, where do they get the nerve?",8
good to bat first and hope that bowling goes well rather than batting collapse in second innings,1
Let's go boys,1
blitzkrieg innings needed from baistow and warner today.,1
Kanos will no longer watch from the shadows,7
Ishant is T H I C C,2
Off topic: I want NZ to win the World Cup in 2023. They honestly deserve and need it more than anybody else,6
"In International T20s, Ishant with the new ball against the likes of Bairstow and Warner would scare the crap out of me as an Indian fan",4

I am ready for a Delhi choke,5
"Jammu and Kashmir boy Abdul Samad in, hope he does good big fanbase he has there.

I am supporting SRH today, I like shake up of points table, unless RR is playing !!",6
My boys SRH not going to disappoint me again. Leggo!,4
"Never in my life, I've heard people cheering for ishant",7
"Some part of DC's turnaround goes to Rahul Dravid as well. When he was the coach he pursued with under-19 players even though the lacked experience and kept collapsing under pressure.
Even ganguly after him. All that is bearing fruits now",3
I see more Deccan charges fans than Delhi capitals fans.,5
"We won the 3rd match in 2016. We're winning this easy, No worries.",9
After the last two games I expect this match to feature at least one double century and three sets of super overs.,3
What was Ishant on last year? 48% dots in powerplay are quite good.,3
Would love to see these 2 run between the wickets at the MCG with the ropes almost out to the fence. They'd run a 6,8

This game is already over. 20 in the first four with the best batsman in a power play.,4
"Lamichhane, Mujeeb & Nabi not getting place in playing 11 feels bad",3
"Stoinis bowling 135 km/hr, when and how has that happened?",6
The fuck is this snooze fest.,5

"Warner and Bairstow tuk tuking along, but why?",3
"Hit Stoinis atleast man, jesus",2
should have taken 3rd over of sharma,1
no Ashwin?,1
"Who is this Caribbean sounding gentleman in the dugout and no offense but what the fuck does he know about cricket?

I want Akash Chopra in the dugout man.",4
Are the SRH openers telling to pull off a Tewatia,2
"I dont mind srh losing. Seeing my man kanos playing, makes me happy",1
Is this usual for a match thread or is it less crowded ?,2
Moonrisers Sleeperabad,6
This fake crowd noise AI was designed by WhiteHead Jr graduates.,6
Good to know that Mitchell from Modern Family is playing cricket,1
"DC looks too fuckin OP, SRH needs to get their 2016 magic to win this one",5
How tf is Bairstow looking so rusty? He has been playing LOIs for over a month,5
This pitch seems slow. If dew doesn't come Delhi will struggle chasing here,3
[deleted],5
Both of them struggling to time the ball.,5
Not a single shot's connected.,4
Pitiful shit this.,6
Swann is gold on dugout,2
Both these batsmen are waiting for the last 4 overs to score 100+ runs given this IPL‚Äôs trend,6
"If you're not gay for Stoinis, you're not man enough",1
Srh 90 all out incoming,4
They are mistiming or mishitting everything,5
"What is SRH play here, score 120 and then try and defend it?",5
"Rabada still hasn't bowled, are they planning to attack him?",2
"Run rate : 5

Bois, we need to slow down and preserve wickets till Lunch",11
I don't know stoinis joined McGrath academy,3
Solid start this for SRH. This is a test match right?,4
Direct throw could have been dangerous,3
"Just stay and play for 20. Whatever comes on the board, we should take it.",3
Man what happened to these lads,3
This fake crowd is so annoying,4
"In preparation for their game against CSK next, Warner and Bairstow are batting like Vijay does in the powerplay.",7
"That slide by Warner lmao, looks like he's born to slide around",2
Have they hit atleast one boundary yet?,2
"Sorry RCB, SRH books the bottom slot of this year's IPL.",10
"If these guys are struggling, the rest of the team is gonna struggle too.",3
Delhi honestly look fucking unbeatable,3
Saha's spirit lives on,6
Has Baristow middled a single ball yet,2
woah aggressive gum chewing there from stoinis,9
"Do these guys know they ""can"" hit a boundary too, it's just not about singles",4
Would be funny if SRH end up 100/1 in 20 overs after not  being able to hit anything.,5
Who's quoting the memes in the dugout?,1
"Since I got ignored on yesterday's discussion post hopefully more people see it here

My proposed Kings XI starting lineup

Rahul

Mayank

Mandeep

Pooran

Sarfaraz

Neesham

Gowtham

Bishnoi

Shami

Cottrell

Mujeeb


This is a rather deep batting lineup and the bowling becomes miles better. At this point I think Gowtham basically offers the same thing that maxi does (maxi is woefully out of form with the bat), but doesn't waste a slot meant for mujeeb. Death bowling is still a problem and if Cottrell doesn't fix up (I think he will) we can always play porel and maxi can come back for Gowtham. Thoughts?",-3
Seriously? No one else thinks Bairstow looks like Mitchell? Just me? Ok,1
Marvel should hire Rabada to replace Chadwick as Black Panther. Wakanda Forever!,2
Tense call,1
Imagine if srh wins todat,1
Too high,2
Height?,2
Umpire‚Äôs call,3
That's gone isn't it,1
Lol Rabada giving his purple cap to Marcus.,6
Stoinis always looks like he has just come back from a street fight.,3
"Coming into the ipl many would have thought that MI's fast bowling was the best, including me, but it's the DC who have the best fast bowling, at least so far. I would love to see how this bowling does as the tournament progresses, especially in the second half.",6
"Shit review, shit shot",1
"Jonathan Bairstow looks a little out of touch, doesn't he?",2
Looked too high,3
"Why would you review, you don't want him out?",5
They're actually trying to hit but struggling badly,6
"Sneaky bastard Iyer, looked like he was throwing the ball at Bairstow end but he throwed at Warner end",6
Wake me up when September ends!,5
Just glad that we a Capable Test Batsman In Kane,11

"Oh, so this is one of *those* seasons for us, very fitting for 2020.",9
SRH = Saha Academy,6
Wow that was a decent review.,6
People in here thinking these guys aren't trying to hit boundariesü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Clearly tough to score. Pitch looks 2 paced.,6
damn close call.,1
That was a shit review.,-4
"Uhhh, atleast we retain the review. I don't like how Umpires call works.",1
Now we know why this thread was dead before the match and even now,4
I've never seen both of them struggling so bad,5
"Johnny you almost gave me heartattack, play well bc. We need to win this",3
Hey srh since you didn't hit sixes or four you are welcome to csk academy.,7
review retained?,5
Looks like even Lord Umesh or Lord Dinda would bowl a maiden over against these batsman,4
"SRH is too dependent on Warner and Bairstow. Scoring rate drops after their wicket.

W and B:  131/0 (20)",1

Jonny Bairstow's using a Ton bat now. The man changes bat sponsor more than the fake heart beats when a team reviews.,6
Nortje looks like he's the Scranton Strangler,4
That S-Presso car looks like complete garbage,5
Rahul-Mayank best opening duo now!!!,3
Iyer dropped Jetha on purpose,3
It will get easier to bat in later inning...srh needs to try their best,5
The crowd noise DJ is doing really bad today .,6
Come on. That was hitting the wickets.,3
Honestly one of them need to go. Both are struggling to time the ball.,7
Don't give these many chances to Baristow,3
What you doing Iyer,2
"Jhonny using all his luck, BC why are you playing like this. Tuk tuk is better than sitting in the dugout.",1
"Mate, are we gonna be last this season?",4
Iyer playing 4d chess by dropping bairstow,3
This Tewatia approach isn't for everyone. Somebody pass this message to Sunrisers.,7
Good Guy Iyer.,2
"Just a thought... surely the size of umpires call should be dependent on how far from the stumps the impact was? 

Bairstow was pretty deep in his crease so there is presumably not as much of a margin of error for ball tracking than if he‚Äôd come down the pitch to a spinner for example.",2
DJ even got ooooooooo sound,5
Shreyas iyer is a pretty shit fielder honestly,-1
"Danny morrison seeing it live: of course it wasn;t an appeal, it is just what bowlers do.

I don't feel too bad seeing csk struggle to hit last match after watching this performance...,-2
bairstow looks so out of touch. what's going on?,1
DC bowling is stacked,4
Srh and Csk are playing their own league,7

"How can Bairstow be scoring centuries, and half centuries, and still be looking this out of form?? Dude's so out of touch right now that he can't even time the ball to carry to the fielders.",1

I am content with how these guys are playing.,5

üëèüëèüëè such good cricket,4
Mishra ji had no chance to chase that against these two.,8
I don‚Äôt get the criticism. They‚Äôve set the perfect base and are accelerating now. If they‚Äôd lost a wicket the momentum wouldn‚Äôt build.,20
These guys are putting in their 100 percent. Hopefully we've some luck here.,5
"Woah, these guys are better than ABD and Kohli too at running",8
Yes. That was a 14-run over.,6
Good running lads,5

Stoinis with the 18+ inch biceps,4

"Phenomenal effort from Warner and Bairstow to see off two Stoinis overs without being distracted by his enormous, throbbing biceps",85
Warner‚Äôs blood is being used as fuel for spacex rockets.,10
Vijay Dahiya has aged well üëå,1
What the fuck with this loud cheer i thought he got out üòë,4
Umpire should be checking for short run. Too many 2's,4
what sucks for SRH is that they probably lack the firepower down the order so these two have to show restraint till at least 15th over,7
Stop disrespecting one of only 2 bowlers who defended 1 run of 3 balls.,5
Someone fucking change gears ffs!,3
How good is Abdul Samad?,6
I wonder if we're going to lose a match by 10 wickets or 100 runs this year,9
No one takes so many steps to run between wickets as lightning fast as David Warner,7
So excited Instant Karma is back in the team.,9
Borefest,3
Tfw kanos back at 3 but srh finish zero wickets down for fuck all.,10
Delhi's team combination is very good. I'd be disappointed if they don't finish in top 2.,7
Here comes the Ishant I know.,1
If they continue for few more overs then I'd like to see either Samad or Abhishek next.,1
"Bairstow has worked his ass of on his running and his fitness and so have many other England players. Have a look at top scores of Yo-Yo tests in Cricket.

They are almost going at 8 RPO despite hitting 2 fours and 2 sixes in 8 overs,2
"Yo Bois late today, ishy boi is playing today",2
Ishant losing plot here. Trying to bowl at his legs.,3
I hope this match is a snooze fest because I can't take another close one. I need a goddamn break.,2
Ishant you're not bowling to Warner,3
"Is the fake crowd chanting ""Pizza.. Pizza.. Pizza""??",3
"Watching this on twitch, 18k viewers and im talking to myself in the chat",2
"Marcus Stoinis has to be careful not to bowl too fast, otherwise his sleeves might completely tear from the sheer power and exertion of his upper arms",8
They should put the speed gun on warner rather than ball release,5
The heat is not good for any outdoor sport. Everyone looks exhausted,4
"How is the pitch? Are they batting well, normal, or poorly?",5
 Smith or Kanos in IPL?,4
This thread ain't even crossing 5k comments today,5
I thought Jhonny gonna tonk that ball through the off side.,5
Boundaries boys. These guys are tired already. I see pressure building up again,7
Swann and Slats can't do commentary without snorting lines.,5
We want to see boundaries not running between the wickets,2
"About time, now keep that up.",7
Need to break this partnership real quick.,3
"Wanrer Anna, kottu nuvvu ( you hit)",8
Us SRH supporters are masochists.,5
Too many slow balls in this over,3
Why isn't Axar bowling? Weird captaincy.,3

Our best two batsmen on strike, and getting acclimated

Wtf ishant bhai. Iska hee wait kar rha tha woh.,2
Somehow SRH looks like a different team today.,5
Is Kane playing today?,1
"Brilliant running again

Stole a single there",2
Ishant limping I think,0
Stoinis bowled better,2
165 will be good score to defend IMO. Tough wicket to bat on.,7

"Good running bois, pick on Sharma ji's next over as well.",5
"Marcus Stoinis: enormous biceps, doesn't go for runs. Ishant Sharma: normal sized biceps, goes for runs. 

You can't tell me it doesn't make you a better cricketer",6
They're run so many doubles and singles that I am in awe how they're still up for more.,9
Wtf they are running so well between the wickets.,9
Not sure if the slower ball is a surprise if you bowl it 4 times in a row.,4
Since being 24 in 5 overs this is actually very fast,3
Mankad someone you cowards,3
Cardoonsix,1
Axar should have bowled rather than Ishant.,1

The running is more exhilarating than the boundaries. Unreal stuff.,7

Not sure why I'm finding this match so boring,3
"YJB: scores a single

fake crowd noise: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay",9
Who the fuck are we saving Rabada for?,1
I think the difference between 2019 Warner and current Warner will be the same as for 2018 Rahul and current Rahul. In 2018 Rahul would go hard from ball 1 as an opener but he later took on responsibility and took his time initially because of the weak middle order. Warner has to do the same now.,6
Bairstow should play thru the ininings and can allow others to hit hard,3
"Can you run 4 runs?? 

These two will easily run 4 if there is a misfield",2
Do you reckon Danny Morrison misses calling Delhi the ‚ÄòDouble Ds‚Äô?,62
Was that a single? A four? A six? The batter discovering a cure for all diseases and ending world poverty and hunger? Just play the exact same crowd noise.... it will be fine,6

What is this about changing gears? They've scored 49 off the last 4 overs. The game is going well. Keep calm and enjoy.,8
Rabada always gets Warner. Poor captaincy to save him for the end.,6
fuck these shitty songs no matter how big ipl gets,1
Tank it boys,4
Axar bowled really well in the 2 games so far. Give him the ball already.,1
Reverse switching Warner is the best Warner.,2
"Who are the rich kids gilding the bot everyday, I want to talk to you guys",4
The fact that these two have hit form just before we face them two games from now fills me with dread.,0
Must be extremely intimidating to bowl to these two first up. Even a centimetre away from perfect makes you look daft. Everyone has an opinion on who the best batsmen are but you really can‚Äôt get much better than having these two open for you,3
Thick boi can't run to save his life.,1
Pitch looked super hard to get started on so these two want to bat out the 20,0
"Seems like a 160 pitch tbh, and srh going at 8.5 an over with no wickets lost",1
Not sure about the value of a slow supporting knock from Bairstow. Williamson has been brought into the team for that role. Bairstow is supposed to be aggressive!,1

Damn only 30 runs have come in boundaries,1
Why is the Mars Curiosity Rover in Abu Dhabi?,0

Everyone seems confident but Warner is like WTF dudes.,2
Oh Warner. You look so guilty.,2
Lmao Swann reckons Warner won't show guilt because he's Australian,2

Defs off the glove,3
Warner‚Äôs sheepish smile is all the DRS we require,4
Rock and roll it,1
Out,4
Why is Rishabh so silent today,3
He's short and slow. Life dealt Prithvi a bad hand here.,2
Shit that hit glove,1
gone...,1
If Marcus Stoinis had played that reverse sweep and the ball had come off his bicep it would have gone for six,4
Crowd cheer sounds like some zombies being run over from a b list Hollywood movie.,4
Good on the ump not to give it just based in the appeal,7
goneeeee,1
Mishraji ko marne chala tha... Bhag,4
That small robo camera is taller than Prithvi Shaw,6

Shukr hai,0
FUCK YEAH,3
"Finally, a breakthrough.
Thanks Mishra Ji",1
SRH frontrunners for fair play wooden spoon too.,2
Good comeback from SRH,1
WTF. That is nothing,6
isn't that disturbance too mild to be considered?,3
"Very small spike on ultra edge though

Was it very faint or just calibration error?",2
Barely even a spike,6
IPL umpiring being consistently shit as expected.,1
[deleted],5
Australian players and not walking away. Tell me a better combo,-3
There wasn't much of a spike,6
Fuck that is a stiff dismissal,4
We've got.,-1
Serial downvoter back for his cameo,6
There is a deviation as well.,4
That wasn‚Äôt a spike,2
Ponting basically captaining from outside the field.,7
[deleted],-4
Its clearly deflected from glove,8
"What d fuck, that is just a tiny tiny spike.",3
tbh that was barely a spike. usually they dont count those. weird.,9
"Uhh, obviously the glove's spike won't be as sharp.",4
Really strict decision. There was barely a spike.,9
Wait what,3
"Can a vice captain tell the umpire to refer for DRS? 

Pant made the T, and the umpire took the DRS, or did Iyer run in and make the T?",2
Unfortunate. Well played.,3
CLEAR DEVIATION,-1
Umpiring has been balls up this season - as usual.,-1
"thats is an itch.. not a spike

but its out though",2
Idk about that one,4
"**9.3** Mishra to Warner, OUT, **big appeal for a catch at the wicket, not given, and they go upstairs right away**. And it has come off the glove. Warner looks for another reverse sweep but this time the ball is not as full as the one that he pulled off two balls ago. Also it doesn't turn and kisses the glove on the way through to Pant **77-1**

DA Warner c &dagger;Pant b Mishra 45 (33b 3x4 2x6) SR: 136.36",0
Is that enough of a spike to overturn the decision?,3
Tough call,3
Anyone else see that it came up with us losing the review hahaha,0
Wow didn‚Äôt think that was enough to be considered,7
I'm not sure that spike is anywhere near big enough to overturn a decision??,7
Is that end of SRH?,0
"Small spike and clear deflection from the glove

You can complain about how small the spike was but it was definitely out",3
SRH FANS TRIGGERED.,-1
Ball does deviate off the gloves. Gloves don't make that much of a noise,8
There was no spike sure but the ball clearly deviated.,4
Huge wicket.,0
"Good decision, ultra edge doesn't trump human vision and common sense lol",2
"3rd umpire clearly would have seen it deviate. The slight spike was just confirmation, don't think the size of the spike really mattered much at that point",-1
There was a noise as well great call,-1
[deleted],1
Guys you can see in replay he gloved it. Doesn't matter what the snicko says it is out for me.,2
"I remember a similar spike the other game, and the 3rd ump was like 'flat line' wtf.",2
It's clearly gloved. Deviates enough in the slow mo.,-1
"Also for everyone saying not out, it clearly deviated off the glove",0
"Yea smart call, when taking in all the information.",-1
TV was showing review lost .... geez,1
you can actually see the ball move a bit after hitting the glove,1
should have just given the strike to bairstow,-1
That UpGrad advertisement is ballsy LMAO.,3
[deleted],4
Chacha Mishra coming in clutch,1
I think it did touch the glove but also there wasn't enough information to overturn the decision.,4
"Is it Kane time? I'm hard

Edit - yo wtf",2
Why not use Hotspot or a combination of Hotspot/Ultraedge for cases like this?,0
"The fucking heatbeat noice, the fake audience dj is more annoying than vuvuzelas.",0
"One test player gone, another test player walks in.",-3
Noooooo I want to see Kanos,1
Still no Kanos,3
Mishraji probably went to the same hair clinic as Dada.,0
I think Williamson should have come before pandey,2
Kanos ):,4
Whoever came here to downvote is only jealous of the biceps of Marcus Stoinis,7
"Did you see pointing gesturing for off spin as pandey was walking out?
Not saying this is a bad thing, but coaches are def leaders of teams now days. Captaincy has become diluted",1
No big spike but clearly looked like it kissed the gloves,4
[deleted],-1
Guys go and download Takatak,-2
Mishraji's and sharmaji's ruling,-1
I have a feeling Kanos won't bat today.,-1
Why has Axar not bowled yet? What is this captaincy?,-1
"""How much of a spike is a spike""

Me: Pulls out Discrete Fourier Transform",13
"...I don't understand how they can justify overturning a decision with that. That is NOT conclusive evidence of glove, that was literally the smallest little wobble of static and it didn't even have a specific peak, it could have been any kind of static interference...

The role of the third umpire is to collect sufficient evidence to OVERTURN a decision - if there isn't bang obvious evidence, how can they do that?

EDIT:

1) ""There was an obvious deviation"" it can't have been that obvious or the umpire would've given it. Moreover, if that was purely the product of the glove, why would there be such a tiny murmur on ultraedge?

2) A ""murmur"" is not sufficient evidence - ultraedge detects SOUND, not ""impact on the glove"". It could be the shuffling of a foot, the abrasion of glove on glove...",1
Dot Ball Pandey will bring DC back into the game.,2
Lol no kanos.,4
Why did pandey come above Williamson,1
Pandey.... I'm slightly confused,1
Whom are we saving Kane for?,3
[deleted],-4
All the weight is on Barstool now,0
"Yeah, even in that slow mo right there you can clearly see the deflection",4
"God, Manish gonna soak up 30 balls just to settle in",6

Now this is gonna get boring as hell as long as Pandey‚Äôs on,2
Young Johnny Bairstow.,2
Can't get over MIshra ji's hair and how fake it looks.,2
"There seemed to be a clear deflection in the replay, but somehow not a big spike on UltraEdge",1
no offense but KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer are not captaincy material.,-6
That a cut from the blades of the Nazgul.,-1
Does jersey no. even matter in cricket?,0
[What's your decision](https://i.imgur.com/LGqksRd.jpg),-5
Me thinks they should've sent Abhishek by giving him license to hit from ball 1,-2
Mishra is such a great seasonal campaigner. Would have loved him back at SRH.,1
No one wants to watch 100 SR Pandey when Kane is there,4
"Clear deflection, no??",5
"The ball clearly touched the gloves, stop complaining",9
Warner was arguing with ump tell me one thing If that was given out would warner had taken review?,4
Why no Axar yet?,3
Lol downvoting army at it yet again,6
That spike on ultra edge was actually the noise of Marcus Stoinis flexing at third man,24
Mishra looking ripped fair play big lad,-2
[deleted],2
"There was clearly a deflection in the ball as it passed the glove, why are people surprised with the decision?",6
Pandey about to shepherd the total to 130,5
"**Most wickets in IPL**

127 - R Ashwin

123 - Sunil Narine",7
"For folks saying there was barely a spike, VAR/DRS is like EA FIFA game: everything happens to make game close instead of being fair.",1

Very poor fielding dhawan,4
I hate the constant referral of anything statistical in sports as moneyball,3
JONNY B,4
Why are batsman struggling so much against this left arm dart bowling?,3
they need a min 10+ rr from here to have a shot at this game.,4
This is going to be an important innings for Bairstow. He looks out of touch,2
Krrrrrackkkkking shot,2
Teams should be awarded extra DRS when playing against MI.,3
How axar has avoided dinda academy till now is one is one of the great mysteries of life,7
Why is prithvi wearing 2 hats?,1
"Bairstow, for the love of god. Never give the strike back to Pandey.",6
bring back Stoinis.,1
"Honestly, despite being IPL 2020 champions, Delhi field poorly.",7
I don't care if Manish Pandey scores 10 runs or 20. He needs to finish at a strike rate of 130+. He has been stat padding  for 2 seasons now,3
"Mishra wanted Elon's hair guy, but ended up with Trump's.   
jk jk, I commend a person for attempting to improve themselves in any way.",6
God I've liked the crowd noise in other games but its proper grating today,6

SRH fans are as annoying as MI and CSK fans.,2
Who are India's best fielder under 25?,3
Manish Pandey had a sr of 170+ in the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy. So he is capable of finding the boundary.,1

GOAT Mishra,1
"Critics- ""mishi bhai still got it""

Wtf do you mean by that, he is still younger than Rashid and Afridi",7
TBH pandey is a slow starter. He can't slog from f9rst ball. Atleast they should have sent Rashid to hit like naraine.,4
Mishraji showing chahal how it's done,3
Thank you Pandey-ji,3
"I remember when SRH picked Manish for 11CR in 2018 auction and our management were discussing whether to use RTM for him.

He played well last season too when batting at 3",1

get ready for some big dick shots!! Williamson is here,2
fake crowd noises are getting worse and worse,3
Jesse lingard of SRH.,4
2 wickets down and we still have competent batsmen batting. Is this SRH?,10
Wait they had Williamson and they sent Pandey. God help SRH!,2
This year we are gonna be at the bottom of the table,2
SRH imploding again. Delhi have an awesome batting unit too. 180-190 is bare minimum and with the way this IPL has been progressing even that might be too less,5
Kane!,4
üòç,3
give us what we want... give us kanos,6
"i hope our boy, kanos, has a good game!",5
Rabada took catch of Murali Vijay last game and today Manish Pandey. Poor feilding.,11

Have we ever seen KG drop a catch in the IPL?,1
"Everyone liked that.

SRH fans are more happy than DC fans that Pandey got out",6
Kanos arrives,2
Kane anna sounds like ganna,4
I don't have any complaints about Manish Pandey. He needs to either accelerate or go home. He went home and did not stat pad,3
Scenes if Kane gets out cheap now.,3
Mishra's hair growth is directly correlated to his wickets in IPL,3
Kane Train! ALL ABOOOOOOOOOARD,5
"Currently the 8th watched stream on twitch, not sure if sus that it seems to randomly gain 3k viewers but I won't complain, its 1080p60 so its nice nice to look at",1

Mishraji is one of the GOATs in IPL ... bit underraated,15

Wasting your strike bowler only for the end overs is not that impressive a strategy to be fair. You can be more aggressive and use him to bowl to Williamson as he came in to bat for example.,5

"He atttac ,he protecc but most importantly he go a big pecc.",5
"What the fuck was that from Stoinis, that was brilliant shit, still saved a run",8
Williamson's shots are so good to watch,8
Kane striking at 150 from the get go on this pitch.,9
Big rig stoin,2
Great cricket all round,3
Kanos - Sublime as ever,3
Kanos is very very special in the wrist work.,5
"Wtf was that throw, Stoinis you're a powerful guy but not that powerful",12
Bairstow with 3 boundaries in 40 balls is unexpected,7
Stoin inventing the mid tumble relay throw,6
For a big guy Hulk is really swift across the field,5
what fielding marcus,3
I don‚Äôt see a really huge over coming with the bowling left.,1
Kagizo rabada more like Kagaz aur rubber,6
If Marcus Stoinis had utilised the full force of his bicep in throwing that back it would have gone across the entire cricket field and handed the Sunrisers six overthrows,14
oooof,1
That 3 was more exciting than most 6s.,12
stoinis gonna come out of this ipl as mvp. $3 mill bid  next year.,5
Off topic but I have lost a lot of respect for Akshay kumar,11
Williamson running three in a 20/20 shit he‚Äôs a gem.,14
You get to appreciate how good Kane is on pitches that are difficult to bat on,8
Does this season have a mid season transfer window?,3
Yes i really feel bad for these multi millionare cricketers have to work very hard to earn their million dollars.,13
Nokia back into attack,7
we still get 9 runs from the over. Not enough though.,2
kane train has arrived...,9
Axar has been brilliant last two matches and he hasn‚Äôt bowled the full quota of overs. Captaincy has been bad.,3
Well either way fuck Sourav Ganguly,2
"If I was named Nortje, I‚Äôd be drowning in pussy all day.",9
Other teams made 80 off 4 overs. I'll be happy if we get them in 5 overs.,7
"Fun fact, Stoin is a fast runner because when him and Dan Ricciardo were kids only Dan had a go kart so Stoin had to run after him everywhere. Don't ask for sources but its true",12
Kane is ART,7
"If BCCI offers a premium video stream without the AI crowd noise for $5 extra, it would take care of their yearly budget. Make.It.Stop.Please  
CC: Pig3   
BCC: My therapist",3
I think Kane and Warner should open followed by Manish and Johnny,2
Bruh Stoinis is built like a tank. My man has been working out.,3
nortje is q d*ddy ngl,2
Just logged in. Why is bairstow playing at low SR?,3
Peek at Rabada abs.,6
Steady the shup,2
Seems like batsmen are afraid to go areal cause of the huge ass boundaries,2
DC is just bowling well. There is nothing these guys can do.,2
Bairstow fucking can't hit a boundary to save his life,1
SRH again saving the wickets for day 2 of the match,5
Kanos you beauty,5
Fk yea Kanos fk yea,3
They are playing only slightly better then saha and manish from the other day,2
Omg I love Williamson so much! He's back!!üò≠üò≠üò≠,9
Kane is such a clever player in the death overs.,5
Kane‚Äôs too likeable for words,3
Choo Choo Muthafucka,9
Williamson you beauty,3
"I mean, can anything more be said about this Gorgeous Human Being.....

I'm a man, but marry me Kane Williamson",7
Oh yesssssaaa,1
Kanos == Intent,4
All aboard the kane train,5
YJB 50(49) coming,4
this batting is damn sex,6
"Williamson should play all the matches he's such a high quality we dont get to enjoy it. 
Williamson should ask to not be retained next year.",4
Shot kanos,6
Kaneo with a Stuart Broad style 'dont leave me out again cunts' so far,6
Eyegasm Batting,4
These blokes need to ~~Twat~~ Tewatia the next 5 overs....,6
Bro! He's angry.,5
Kanos üòçüòç,3
"Holy shit I just jizz my pants, look at that masterclass",6
Ohh kane u sexy man,2
"Barstool hasn't been at his best, Kane is just showing his class.",3
Oh my God Kane. I can only get so erect,5
Holy shit what a shot,2
"Ball touches the bat. 

DJ: let me add some crowd noise.",6
Kanos you beauty,1
Kanos ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,4
"Kane!!!! If the Sunrisers let go of you, I will cry",5
*KANOS^TM*,2
God,2
Masters the art of finding gaps,3
Helicopter shot from Kane,5
I mean imagine not considering kane as the first name on the sheet,5
Kanos we waited for you since last year.,3
inb4 50(50) for bairstow,3
Pierced that fucking gap.,4
BC bowl bouncer/slower ball/Yorker not length.,3
Kanos is in the house!!,3
"Kane, marry me.",13
"Fuck that was amazing placement, his selection was worth it just for that shot",2
Every time they show ponting i want his team to lose.,3
Helicopter cover drive,6
Yes Kanos is feeling it,3
Too good to be sitting on the bench man..,10
"Nortje bro ab isko out bhi kar de, form toh de di",3
As a CSK fan I will support every team playing against SRH so that SRH wins the wooden spoon instead of CSK. But I also accept the fact that wooden spoon for CSK is inevitable this year.,4
He looks in unreal form.,6
Woah! How could you bisect like that.,9
Just what the doc ordered for SRH,12
Kane is angery now.,14
This thread is having a collective Orgasm right now.,35
What shots man what shots,10
"Man nortje and Rabada have so far been the best bowling duo in this tournament.

Event boundaries scored aren't hit off the bat properly",12
"Cannot stress this enough. 




KANE WILLIAMSON IS THE MEANING OF LIFE",48
BAIRSLOW,3
"I still don‚Äôt think Kane helps team balance but I don‚Äôt give a fuck if we lose and I get to watch him bat like this. Kane is love, Kane is life",19
Kanos' batting style is actually like ABD's from yesterday lmao,14
Kane will get his 50 before Bairstow,4
Bairstow do something Ed Smith is watching,3
"Going on the last two matches, 200 should be easy from here right?",2
KANEEEE üí¶üí¶,10
Kane is absolutely gassed.,9
Imagine Kane in the first two matches,13
"I know that the last 2 games have changed my view of this but Williamson's 23(14) isn't exactly ""racing along"" anymore...",3
Imagine not picking Kane in your team,12
Feels very pleasant watching Kane on the ground..,3
all bitches know is tuktuk and be ginger,7
Nokia hasn't been hit like that since 3310 came out .,14
"Kano channels Attapattu  with that shot !  Solid batter, awesome person !",2
All abord the Kane Train...especially the younglings of DC,6
Kane coming back like the Rohirrim to save us from the bottom spot.,7
Haven't there been 2 time outs already! These fuckers know how to break momentum.,3
Class batting by Kanos. Picking those gaps with ease,5
50 from here would be a decent score?,5
"Kane playing with intent. The intent: ""don't you dare to drop me again.""",30
"Nah, who is this Kane...

I'd rather have Saha",7
"KANOS, COME TO ~~BESIKTAS~~ CSK!!!",2
We should really see if Kane can open with Warner,3
what a shit innings from the ginger,4
Did anyone take the timeout before the 16 overs recently?,2
"Williamson is a T20 great yet people think he can‚Äôt strike at 150+  

Even won the orange cap a while back yet people still doubt him...",28
Kanos making everyone out here hard.,4
Anything over 160-170 and we probably should be able to defend.,7
I am happy for Kane. Pretty sure this innings will at least guarantee his place for a few more matches.,12
inb4 Baristow's 100* (60),9
Kanos is clear,5
Kanos > Warner + YJB,12
I better not see Kanos on the bench in any more matches this IPL,30
All girls who understand cricket and watch Kanos must be in love....,10
"""Bowling teams will have their plans cutout"", somehow still sounds right, even though he meant to say ""Bowling teams will have their task cut out"".",5
Mama Kane Mama bolte,16
Williamson > Warner nowadays,8
Fun fact Kanos is paid only 3.5 crores,13
So SRH bowling is basically Rashid right?,5
"Kane, the type of dude that marries your sister and yet you‚Äôre always trying to hangout with him.",8
Honest question : Is it Nortya or Nokya ?,2
"Warner : Kanos is the balance we needed?

Orange Army : Has always been.",14
I think this is the first time I am seeing an angry kane,3
DC honestly look like such a well planned team. Like literally everything they do seems like it is the brainchild of Ponting and co.,8
Can we have an official apology from the SRH management for not playing KANOS until now.,21
Kanos mode activated mans about to snap,3
This kane guy looks great! wonder if he is available for cSk  üåö,3
Is anyone able to give a running translation for all the ads that are playing? I feel bad watching the stream on twitch and not being able to understand like 3/4 of the ads. I don't wanna scamaz the advertisers,3
How the fuck do you waste away ‚Äústrike‚Äù bowlers at the death? Bowl them when batsman is new to the crease for fucks sake.,3
kaifiii <3,3
"I don't understand the ""Ashely Martin"" Hair Ad....",3
"Does Kane have a serious back injury??? He is grunting while playing the pull shot, and has a sort of a grimace on his face afterwards.",4
[removed],2
"Warner and Kane should open, then if it's inside 10 overs 1 down pandey should come and if it's over, Johny can come in.",4
Stoin‚Äôs economy damn that‚Äôs tight,5
Why Stoinis why!,2
Kane Williamson's only getting paid ‚Çπ3 crore. Should definitely ask  to be released and try his luck in auction.,11
We need Nokia and Ishant back,7
I hope the people who want 'balance b/w bat and ball'  enjoying this match,5
Dumb captaincy to bowl Stoinis here.,1
Last 4 overs. Do a Tewatia now,3
One more wicket and we‚Äôll restrict them to 170,3
Iyer looks the kind of guy who thinks Friends is the funniest tv show ever made.,12
Stoinis is such an overrated player damn,-2
There's that familiar guide to 3rd man region,2
Cred has had the best ads this IPL.,7
Someone attack The Stoin Stoin Man.,4
How could they have not fine tuned the crowd noise yet?,3
Only if the outfield was swift,2
That's a dolly full toss for fuck sake.,2
Jesus someone fix the fake crowd noise,3
Why didn't Bairstow smash that full toss lol. So unlike him.,7
"This is what we were missing so much. A batsman who can go at 130-140 without breaking a sweat, someone to keep the runs flowing and reduce the pressure on Bairstow and Warner. Pandey cannot play at 3, what he offers is not worth it at all.",4
Tamil commentary is so insipid it's hilarious.,5
Wtf happened to Bairstow,2
"Cmon Johnny, you should be able to hit a full toss after facing 40 balls",8
They need to target Stoinis,3
You know Bairstow is out of form when he isn't even punishing full toss deliveries,9
Kane mama ‚ù§Ô∏è,10
Stoinis giving only 12 in 2.2 is so good for DC. And that was a six.,7
fuck ugh williamson why you so good,8
Stomp them kane,2
Williamson playing superbly,4
Kane scoring Bairstow's runs as well lmaoooo,4
Rabada ka kabada karde bhai,3
Chutye gabbar ke bache. Hagdu!,-2
Bairstow playing like Williamson and Williamson playing like Bairstow today,10
"After the Ceat Tyre strategic timeout, I want to see a Byju‚Äôs ball buster.",2
What was that fielding? Pooran ji ke ladke ko dekho,2
Our fielding is ridiculous.,4
Straight down his throat if he was on the rope,2
"I want me some kane love :""v",4
That behind the shoulder boundary was Abd-esque,3
r/Cricket 's favourite bois go against each other  gonna be good,7
stoinis is a  u n i t,3
Someone dm me the twitch stream,3
OMFG Kanos,7
Jonny *Ron Weasly* Bairstow needs to waive the band!,6
Shot boy. That bent knee,3
Tesla should get Kanos to improve their pickup to this man's class!!,8

Dude this is just.... Beautiful,8
"Okay, this is the hardest I've ever been",9
Tewatia mode activated,5
Watching Williamson be like: Why wasn't he out here all this time. (Infinity was reference),10
NEVER EVER DROP WILLIAMSON EVER AGAIN,16
Kane is whooping ass like stone cold style.,10
No Kane No Gain,13
Kane Anna vachadu ra,11
I never knew I would love an angry Kane. BRING IT ON,10
Yes that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt bowl Stoinis when you don‚Äôt need to.,5
Imagine benching this guy when your middle order looks like what it does,12
"kanos really said ‚ú®fine, I‚Äôll do it myself‚ú®",13
This is why everyone wanted Kanos to play,9
"Guys, I was struggling financiallyüòò, I didn't want to work ü§´ or anything like that üòè then I started playing dream 11 üíÉ

and now i am in debtüòÇ, the hitmen are behind me üò©",17
Kanos is such a treat to watch.,8
"Those *Experts* saying Kane won't solve SRH's middle order issues. Fuck you all, with due respect.",29
Srh walo please don't ever bench kano,5
"so warner and srh managment, where was he ?",7
Smooooth operatoor of cricket,4
Imagine telling somebody a couple of years ago that in the future Kane would evolve as a T20 finisher.,10
Rooting for DC but I'm loving this Kanos onslaught ‚ù§Ô∏è,3

Haha! That's the most awkward pull I've ever seen.,0
Quick someone piss off Bairstow,1

"So fkn cringe, but I still laugh in shame.",3
"All aboard Kane train. 

IPL 2018 flashbacks.",7
SRH you guys fucked up so fucking big by not playing Kane. And I don't think for once think that Kane was genuinely injured.,13
I didn‚Äôt even realise dhawan was playing...,7
Fck team balance. Kane Mama FTW,16
"Ah yes, our middle order.

Kane Williamson.",27
Kane in WWE Kane's mood today.,8
"FM. Teddy Bearslow. Step it up, man.",12

"Turns out, Kane was all we needed all along",6
I wish Rob Key's first name was Don.,7
I cannot believe how bad the captaincy has been from Delhi.,2
50 in last 3 ?,1
Bairstow looks pretty unsettled even after 17 overs in the middle. Haha,3
If they get 175-180 dc are fucked,6
"Warner, Bairstow, Kane. That will easily be the best top 3 in the IPL, chuck Pandey to 4.",4
"SRH Secrit Play:

1) Play shit first two games 


2) Third game, realise you have one of the best batsmen in the world on the bench

3) Shall we play him?",5
"I'm not gay. I am not gay. Do not fucking call me gay ever again. I am quite honestly one of the least gay people you have ever met. I fuck bitches, mad fucking fucked bitches. I am not gay. I am not gay. Stop saying I am gay. If you were a girl, I would have probably already fucked the shit out of you by now, but unfortunately you are an ugly fucking GUY whose tight bussy will remained un-stretched by my fat, meaty, nine inch cock because I AM NOT GAY. If I was gay though, you would find my Jackhammer pounding your tight little bussy with the force of ten tsunamis. Luckily for you, I am NOT GAY, and you will have your virgin asshole remain unpounded ad infinitum. Actually, it seems to me like you are the gay one here. You are gay, not me. I am not gay, and I will never be. If I was ever gay in a past life (which I WASN'T), I would be killing myself right now, that is how gay I AM NOT. But, if Kane comes to me I would gladly rub lotion all over his naked body and perform a sensual Nuru Massage and let him do whatever he wants. But, don't ever fucking call me gay.",10
Yjb expect more man. Dont statpad,1
"I swear every time SRH plays, either Warner or Bairstow get out and the other stays for the entire game",1
Kane is gonna make the whole Orange Army orgasm in unison. Ain't he?,6
Bairstow still is not able to get going.,5
Bairstow needs to accelerate,5
That interview last game with Kanos triggered him,13
3 overs 51?,2
YJB it‚Äôs your time now,3
"No Kane No Gain.

&#x200B;

Chad Kane vs Virgins of Delhi",7
punted,2
This Bairstow innings is reminding me of the innings Chris Lynn played against SRH last year. Made a 50 at barely above a run a ball and looked super out of touch.,0
"I hope Bairstow can accelerate and improve the strike rate before he gets out , they need more runs to defend against this team",2
Now bowl Axar instead of Rabada to finish off and be consistent with shit captaincy.,2
Kaneo looking like he's batting on a different pitch to the others,5
Bairstow wants that 50 so badly! He will prolly get out just at 50 because Karma is a bitch,2
Stoinis can be cast as next James Bond,2
If Kane was playing the first 2 games we would‚Äôve won the IPL trophy already.,16
"Marcus Stoinis will travel back to Australia, head to Shikhar Dhawan's house down in Narre Warren and hip and shoulder his letterbox with his right bicep and send it hurtling down the street",6
Chad Kane vs Virgin Iyer,11
Did pant even grab the ball?,8
"You would have to think they try to push on a bit more now, 2 overs left, hopefully see some fireworks",2
"Bairstow is gonna open his can of whoopass now, for sure

Just reached his 50 too",4
Bairstow making Pandey proud,3
You had one job Rishabh,3
[deleted],1
Square leg umpire is standing at mid wicket. What a twat!,1
"50 to YJB, good innings. Cant blame him to going slow. We don't have any batsman left below him. Hope he accelerates from now on. He is in out of touch. Hope this brings him to form.",6
Pls get out Bairstow ffs,2
60 or 70 in last 3 overs?,4
Anyone with half a brain would have bowled Rabada in the 17th over even if you wanted to bowl Stoinis (give him 18th over).,1
What the fuck was that Pant?,12
He's clearly in anyway so it doesn't matter,11
Kane Williamson vs Delhi Capitals & Johnny Bairstow,3
"How does it matter what hit the stumps, he's in anyway.",6
"Kane should be playing every game, makes no sense to make him sit",3
Not sure if he's Sundaram Ravi or Sunni Ravi.,1
Barristow only has 14 runs from boundaries. He ran the remaining!,11
Why are they taking so long? He is clearly in?,11
Rusty fifty by gringo,3
Surely that was a troll,5
Well played Jonny!,1
What happened to the Ana De Armas ad? It was the only one that didn‚Äôt make my eyes burn.,5
Time waste,4
"That‚Äôs not out, get on with it already",7
The definition of Rishab Pant,3
The fake crowd appalled that wasn‚Äôt out,2
Hurts me to watch YJB like this,1
That was 3rd umpire mocking Rishab,5
HE WAS IN ANYWAY,3
Why is the third umpire obsessing over the keeper breaking the stumps with his gloves when the batsman is well in anyway?,6
"Idk how the Fairplay award works, but that should take a few points away from Delhi, right?",3
Pant is such a shit keeper.. I,1
End this misery for Bairstow!,2
50 run partnership and Kane's on 38. Jonny needs to shit or get off the pot.,6
Start hitting now BC,1
Umpires are so incompetent it‚Äôs unbelievable,8
Lol Brett Lee taking the piss üòÇ,5
Confidence is when you don't even have the ball but appeal for a run out,7
Why does it matter if ball missed stumps? Bairstow was already in,3
Samson + Ishan laughing!,5
"Thicc, Trunky Coastal Rishabh",2
If only Rishabh worked on his keeping during the lockdown instead of eating biryani,-1
How the fuck does a third ump need so much time to give that decision. Ffs even ground umpires were capable of giving that decision in real-time not that long ago.,5
Seeesh,1
"Good , run him out Kanos lmak",3
Why take 2 minutes to debate whether the gloves broke the stump when the bat was in regardles.....,5
Lmaoo this hindi commentator just went ‚Äúwaste of time‚Äù during that third umpire review,8
Bairstow playing proper Dhawan role here.,9
"Give me a 153 angle from the drone above and then spider cam thanks!

Bat's in anyway thanks guys",9
Oh come on wtf was that umpire looking at then?,12
Dugout used to be so good in 2017/18. This is pure tatti.,0
Me watching kane bat [https://i.imgflip.com/30be1n.png](https://i.imgflip.com/30be1n.png),1
Close,2
"Why would anyone review this

How dumb is this umpiring",9
"Noooooo,don't give me heartattack.",1
What was Pant about? Ball didn't even hit the stumps.,1
What the fuck umpire?,1
Johnny Bairstow last hit a boundary in the 11th over.,6
what the fuck is he replaying that 12 times for,7
"Why do we even have on field umpires anymore, they literally make more wrong calls than correct ones.",5
Cheeky pant,2
first the tuk tuk now the run out scares... thala is that you?,7
"Want to see Samad bat, kindly get out soon. Thanks.",1
Bairstow wtf,3
"Missing the ball completely and Bairstow, name a better duo",4
Who the fuck are these 2 rupee umpires,7
This is the first time I think I've seen Barstool struggle like this. But still he's scored fifty. And that's good for SRH,6
Shami already with 7 wickets,3
Give that strike to kanos,1
bairstow is a bit slow for someone who's set and played 18 overs.,9
Pant is a shit keeper lmao,2
Just started watching. Why is SRH‚Äôs run rate so low?,3
Gone,3
"The third umpire had already finished jacking off to slow mo replays, so this one was quicker.",7
"Partnership: 50 off 36 

Kanos: 38 off 21",6
Mute the fake crowd noise in dugout ffs.,7
Hahahah the hindi commentator was saying that the 3rd umpire could've taken even more time if it wasn't obvious enough,3
Johnny come on man that is underwhelming stuff,3
Kanos is playing on a different pitch or just too good,4
Abdul Samad hype train.......,4
Well atleast he hit a 50,6
‚ÄúBairstrow‚Äù lmaooo,1
Solid ODI knock from Bairstow,6
Wow,1
"Haaat bc, looking to get out after 50. Should have given kanos strike and target some other bowler.",4
odi knock by bairstow,6
Send in Samad please,3
"Brett Lee calling Lara ""BC"". The absolute disrespect..!! ^/s",7
We all knew 50 was YJB's target,3
Oh god he scored a 50 but never got off,3
Virgin Bairstow innings today,4
"That was right in the slot, should have gone for six tbh",5
That was waiting to happen lol,6
"**17.5** Rabada to Bairstow, OUT,  **144-3**

JM Bairstow c Nortje b Rabada 53 (48b 2x4 1x6) SR: 110.41",2
Tewatia > Bairstow üòû,2
Bairstow was either really tired or he just wanted tuk tuk 50,3
Bairstew,5
DC should make sure Bairstow doesn't get out at any cost,7
Samad in ffs,2
So Bairstow made a 50 even when he's at his worst timing wise,5
Poor innings from bairstow tbh. Manish pandey would be crucified for the same,10
He never looked comfortable tbh,6
"Not everyone can be Tewatia, Johnny boy!",9
53(48) Oh YBJ that was not up to standards.,4
So getting hit on the balls is the secret to getting a fifty. Got it.,5
How good is Rabada with his change ups.,2
Rabada reminds me of peak Malinga in IPL.,5
poor innings,1
Well played. It was a difficult wicket to bat on.,5
I think if bairstow had another 2 overs to get himself in he would have unleashed 6s,3
Kane's batting or Rabada's smile?,1
Bairstow is a good batsman but not as good as he is rated in this sub.,0
"He looked in bad touch. That ball was asking for a 6, worst he‚Äôs looked for srh",4
Arey Barrey Stove,1
"Game deciding close single run: * I got big dick and I can handle it myself *

Clearly not out on a run out appeal: * 3rd umpireeee UwU *",1
Rabada beautiful smile.,2
"Kagiso Rabada fist bumps everyone at the Capitals after taking a wicket, except the one from Marcus Stoinis is met with some extra resistance due to his immeasurable biceps and jars Rabada's hand a little bit",6
"Some days you‚Äôre a Tewatia, some days you‚Äôre a Bairstow",5
If not for Kanos it would have been another 140,6
"Chief DC cheerleader Vikrant Gupta: Rabada ne kar diya SRH ka kabada, thodi der ruk jao mein ek aur mooth maar ke aa raha!

T: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down!",2
bairstow taking an unconventional route to the test team,6
Rabada is such a treat to watch whenever he is bowling.,2
Samad please be a diamond in the rough,2
the bat was grounded for a good 4-5 seconds before rabada broke the stumps. lol dafuk is the role of the on field umpire if everything goes to the 3rd umpire.,2
"You did good Johnny or SRH would have been at worse position, well Kanos is Kanos, some players just bat on different surface than all...",4
Who's the new guy,1
Just keep Kanos off the strike,1
Those doubles with Warner took a lot out of Bairstow,1
On field umpires are reminding me of myself in first 3 months of starting my job. We did the same work - whatever was got right it was done by others and rest of time was a delicate balance of doing nothing and getting things wrong.,5
I love how very little nervous energy you can feel in DC team,8
This is exciting.,1
Samad hype!!,1
Rabada is SO cute omg,6
"Underpar innings by Bairstow, but well bowled by Rabada as well. Hyped to see what Samad can do though. Can really bring some much needed representation for Kashmiris",3
"too much pressure on samad, man.",2
Good knock from Jonny (if this was an ODI lmao).,2
Send in Rashid you pussies,3
Download cred baby...it's catchy no,3
Apparently samad has a 100+ SR in ranji trophy,3
Bairstow overshot his target by 3 runs,1
And people were bitching over saving rabada's overs,1
"But harsh sending in an 18 year old debutant with two overs left to whack, should've sent in Abhishek or Rashid",1
Bangar giving a Geograhy lesson,0
Shoulda put Rash in,1
Im gonna make an early prediction: SRH is gonna end up at the bottom this year.,4
"Phonepe ad doesn't make sense, they are showing that they are paying bail amount through Phone pe and in disclaimer they have mentioned that phonepe app cannot be used to pay anything at a police station. Thenwhy the fuck are you showing this ad, make something else.",15
Who is Samad?Is he supposed to be good? Genuinly Asking,8
Statpadder Bairstow,5
Samad hit some hard,8
Let's see how is samad. Lot of hype.,2
Go Kanos get the 50 you rightfully deserve!,4
Both our death over batsmen Warner and Bairstow got out..,8
The DC songs sucks no offence,2
"Hey kid, it's your debut match. You got 12 balls, so go crazy


SRH management probably",11
Looks like Lara is also a fan of Kanos. Not surprising..,5
"Samad take it cool, like dear Kanos.",9
Kannum Kannum Nortje,8
Let's see if the J&K lad can blast some,3
poor samad. first over gonna be the fastest bowler in the IPL.,6
You may think Bairstow played a bit slow but some of the balls were too fast and other balls were too slow not enough of them were just right and someone ate all his porridge,19
"Rabada is bowling good, I think in best form of all fast bowlers",4
Samad only cost 5.5 in fantasy league picked him for that only,4
This is a bowlers pitch. 160+ is looking here easily and I don't think this will be easy for dc. Definitely a competitive match.,2
[deleted],3
Intent‚Ñ¢,4
Cmon Samad üëèüëèüëè,2
I haven‚Äôt seen an RNS in a while. Probably since Ben Rohrer retired,2
Rashid is going to wreak havoc on this pitch,2
Axar patel looks like young Ravi shastri,4
INTENT. Yay!,6
For once please SRH give is one promising youngster.,5
Boy got that intent,7
Snort-hay bowling now!,2
Oh fuck,4
Intent,2
Kane should play as many of the remaining balls as possible,3
Can we have dual flairs mod?,5
We shouldn't actually shit on Bairstow. He did play a slow innings but if it gives him confidence to score like his original self in future matches so sure why not?,7
Nice to see Kanos bat after so long.,1
2 years back 150 would have been more than enough for SRH to defend... I want those days back... When bhuvi bowled yorkers on will,10
Jonny Bairstow probably goes and scores 150 tonight if his arms were the size of Marcus Stoinis's,4
"Very cool to see a player from J&K. Have there been others for India, even if not the IPL?",12
whats a good score here this ipl?,2
I N T E N T,3
Watch the ball. Watch the ball.,5
He got the intent,3
Oh boy atleast get to 170...,5
"Oh shit RCB's next match is against RR







Lord Tewatia please spare us",9
Wtf is a defensive yorker?,0
Oh luck finally,7
This is great rotation of strike from SRH which is a text book example of how to bat in an....ODI,1
Anything will do currently,2
It's pronounced like Nokia? wow,6
Not another blind hit youngster please just one youngster for SRH has to click.,5
[deleted],-2
Harsha is tingling seeing Samad bat,11
How many times Samad would have played a 140+ ball in his life?,9
"150 up guys

Moral Victory for us",14
He is not even looking at the ball,3
Samad showed more intent in that single than Pandeyjis entire career at SRH,13
It went exactly where he wanted it to go. Cant find any fault in that. Good shot,9
Every match we have one scorer that could only manage 100 strike rate.,5
Holy shit!,7
Shot boy,9
Oh boyyy. Daddy samad,4
WOAH. SMACKKED,4
Samad>>>>>>>>>>>>Saha,5
Fuck that's HUUUGE man,9
Fuckin Glorious!,3
"Not only does Rabada take wickets regularly, but you almost never see him getting hit all over.",5
Abdul Samad = Yusuf Pathan,6
The fuck.,5
lmao did you realise they didn't show the shit stat of *total sixes distance* after that match,9
mboi coming in w the I n t e n t,2
oi oi Abdul,6
what happned to sid kaul?,2
Oh my good god !! Who is this guy ?,6
That's enroute Kashmir,5
HOLY FUCK! SAMAD LETS GO,10
HOLY SHIT FINALLY A GOOD MIDDLE ORDER I'M SWIMMING IN JIZZ,28
"That ball gone, bring another one. Huuuuge hit",6
This is why he's so good clean hitting against 145 kmph,5
Holy fuck,8
Sent to Kashmir,10
HOLY COW,3
That was yuge,3
Samad you beauty,3
OI THATS FKN SEXY,4
Holy fuck wow that was something,5
Oh boy he is goood,9
Yes finally!!!! That was gorgeous.,8
Okay we‚Äôve seen enough. Retain this lad...,9
Absolute Monster,6
Nokia looks like south african sebastian vettel ngl,6
Yeeaaahhhh,5
Where was this guy hiding?!,11
Chad Samad,7
He's a wee lad with a big stick,6
that fuckin flew up there damn,2
Only 18 years old,4
A lower order SRH batsman hitting a six? What world is this?,8
Statement made.,2
Delhi better show some fucking intent while chasing.,5
Why was he out in the first 2 games,5
"That was huge, indian t20 middle order future is secured if bewda plays it well",3
"Wait, so you're telling me we hid this guy and played saha last game??",7
"Samad looks decent, hope Abhishek Sharma and him can solve our middle order crisis.",4
This guy looks good. I am so happy that youngsters are doing well this season. Bodes well for the future of Indian cricket,4
Young samad from Kashmir!!,7
"Nice shot , looks like SRH found themselves a hitter",3
points were made.,3
Why didn't this guy play from the first match? They needed a finisher,3
WE GOT OUR POWER HITTER!!!,4
You application for dinda academy will be considered norje.,2
who's cutting onions??,2
Weak middle order who?,3
Rabada is straight up fire,4
Ouch,2
Hit on the 4th ab,2
Ouch,2
SRH -where the heck did u hide this guy until now?,6
That's it. Don't even think of dropping Samad. He has intent and he can hit sixes.,5
"Take care kane, give strike to other guy
 He seems to hit out of the park as well.",2
Pitch soo flat even a 18 year old no name player Can hit a 145 km ball a mile out the park,-4
"Don't injure Him, KG! Or we'll break up.",6
ouch,3

All hype was true around Abdul it seems,4
Stop swinging blindly when you've the power.,3
Close your eyes and Swing,2
Come on now Samad be smart here get Kanos on strike,5
Kane mama üò¢üò≠,5
This is Why Samad came in. I think SRH has finally got the 11.,9
Future Yusuf Pathan. Now don‚Äôt @ me.,10
This is already a hard total.,3
Play for the slower one.,3
Swing Samad,4
Kanos should keep the strike,2
That would have been a wide,2
Commentators not taking chances by pronouncing Nokia's first name. His entire name is a mispronunciation trap.,10
Srh just feels so weak idk why,5
"I'm loving Kane's batting, he's just placing the balls and has a high strike rate also love how he stays in the crease when he's at the runners end.",9
Lol Pant,2
Rishabh batting behind the wickets as well,9
Thanks Pant,6
170 170 170 cmon,4
Maar Samad maarrrr,2
Nice,2
:'(,6
Why is Rabada fuckin good at death,13
This ground is surprisingly big.,3
Have Delhi bowled at Sharjah...?? Would test their death bowling,4
He deserved that fifty üò≠üò≠,15
feel sorry for kane but I love rabada fuck,8
NOOOOOOOOOO,2
Kanos gets a 100 from me,8
That would be six at Sharjah,3
"Rabada, so good.",3
Rabada is so good. Why is he not in SRH T.T,7
Come on Pant,1
That'd have been Six in Sarjah.,11
The intent. That's all we asked.. thank you.,6
Moral of the innings: Kane is going to carry SRH this season,4
Rabada should be banned,3
GG. Kane did his bit.,4
"PLAYED KANOS, NOT BAD",4
Kane's helicopter fell short - shame.,1
Hats off to Kanos,2
Fuck! How good is Rabada,3
"A top batsman in the middle order and suddenly you don‚Äôt collapse after your openers, and get a decent score.
Who would have thought",1
Atleast they reached 160 didn't expect that but Iyer bowled Stoinis at death,2
Shit,1
"Aah shit, good effort kane. Would have been dolmed without you. Take rest, we need you in the field. We need  to win this game.",3
Well played Kane mama. Don't even fucking think of dropping him again.,3
Rabada is the true OP fast bowler at the death.,3
Well played kanos,1
Rabada is simply killing this inning.,3
Nothing is working. Here we are looking at 160 and thing it's a good batting performance,3
[deleted],-5
Kanos ): but Rabada (:,0
Does anybody else think Shreyas Iyer is gonna be the next Indian captain? After Kohli era?,5
Rabada purple cap!,5
Oh no! Well played. It was a fine innings.,2
DC got Rabada for 4.2 crores...,8
"Imagine if they'd sent Kanos at 3 instead of the bottler, the score would be reading 170+ by now",6
Nice having you Kanos. Im a happy SRH fan today.,5
"Don't know why but I find Darren Ganga's voice very comforting. Same with Ian Bishop. Maybe its their CPL / WI connection, I don't know..",6
Williamson needs a new team this one cannot make room for him.,5
"Williamson is the only guy who looked anywhere near settled here , need change at the top",7
on that note what the absolute fuck is pant doing tonight,5
"Kohli be like,  ""oh betichod, death overs mein dot bhi hoti hai""",13
Lol kw played a Rashid Khan shot there. Show him how it's done rash!,5
Rabada just keeps delivering match after match after match,12
Excellent over this from KG!,5
"41 (26), good innings from Kanos.",11
Bhuvi and Khaleel aren't in greatest of form ... so all is not lost tbh.,6
"**19.4** Rabada to Williamson, OUT, full, 143ks, cross-seam, no room, Williamson looks to whip it to leg, but the slowness of the pitch means  he can send it only as far as the boundary rider at midwicket **160-4**

KS Williamson c Patel b Rabada 41 (26b 5x4 0x6) SR: 157.69",3
Rabada targeting kidneys now,8
"Poor Abhishek, always get 1 or 2 balls to play.",3
"Kane Anna, luv you raja! Great innings",4
Yeah Rabada is not going to cunted by unknown players.,19
"Feel bad for Samad

Rabada just too good",5
I'm not sold on Samad yet. He is not proper watching ball. Then again he is going up against likes of Rabada in his debut.,9
Williamson trying the helicopter shot :),5
"If Kane wasn't playing, our score would be 140/7 in 20 overs",30
And Rabada takes the top spot once again as the highest wicket taker so far with 7 scalps ahead of Shami,8
"Death, taxes and Rabada getting wickets at the death...",13
This commentary,2
163 is actually a good score here. Can totally defend,5
Rabada's 2 wicket per match steak continues,11
Rabada is god,8
Feel bad for poor Abhishek. Always comes at fag end.,8
smart catch ‚Ñ¢,3
gave 5 runs in last over and 4 in this . Too fuckin good,8
"Lmao, Harsha is such a blatant Sunrisers fan",75
Lol the drama,4
What a fucking tragedy of an over.,16
"Oof that's poor

Missed by a big amount there, should've been a comfortable 2",14
Rabada is so fucking good at the death,9
Short run against Delhi. Feel like I have seen this before.,14
"Decent total, just need Rashid + Bhuvi to be OP again and we are good boiz",12
Well batted boys!,5
Always good to have Harsha for SRH games.,12
We are going to lose by 1 run aren't we,11
Solid score on this pitch,7
Rabada is insane. And he's not even in his prime yet.,9
Good call by the umpire on that short run. He was alert.,8
"Priyam Garg, Abhishek Sharma, Abdul Samad..why is SRH's Indian batting contingent straight from the U19s",7
"HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF, DC CONCEDING A SHORT RUN WILL THIS COST SRH IN THE FORM OF A SUPER OVER

IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF THE IPL......",10
lmao last over,5
"Those saying Kanos played a Helicopter shot, it's the uppish whip that he plays almost once every match. Not everything is ‚Ñ¢ to India.",15
"Fantastic death bowling.....Earn your runs fuckers....No half volleys, full tosses",14
"Expecting Delhi toh cruise control the chase, and then go bonkers and lose by 10 runs",14
"Rabada too good man, looking better than Cummins, Jofra and Bumrah right now !!!",13
"Bc shourt run , you have all the time to run two. 

Warner and Jhonny need to make him run hundred time b/w wickets to teach him running. Trying to pull sneaky one when 10's cameras around.",7
Umpire signalling first bounce on the last ball of the over lol,7
Umpires making up for their mistakes,2
Great final over by Rabada. SRH was looking good for 180 at one time.,9
[Did not call it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j1xyyh/match_thread_11th_match_delhi_capitals_v/g72jokp/),5
Honestly it‚Äôs a HUGE ask to expect these youngsters to face arguably the best death bowler today. I really wish they get more game time in future games.,14
short run trauma,4
Did SRH forget Rashid Khan's six smashing capabilities!?,6
Can yall just open with the Hulk so I can go to bed soon pls Delhi?,4
not great but not terrible either.,4
Last over will give an orgasm to shitty SRH management,7
Rabada is a cheat code.Last we had a decent finisher we won the league (cutting) before and after that we always struggled to finish.,9
Rabada is so good at the death overs,3
Rabada is just so good man,2
calling it now. we are losing by one run,3
Delhi Capitals and one run short is still a better love story than twilight. Hopefully no petitions for this one. Lol.,0
So what's the call? Is 162 enough?,4
Kane hasn't played a single dot ball in this innings. That's a perfect middle order T20 batsman for you.,63
Tbh I think we have enough on the board. Just need our bowlers to get up to form again.,10
How long are the breaks in IPL? Not sure if I can keep myself awake for the second half of this game,2
"Any format, any day, any scenario: Rabada is a pretty safe bet",12
Will the famed srh bowling attack defend this total successfully?,6
"163 is a pretty good score. Might defend it. With Kane back in the field. And I'm calling it, Prithiv will run himself or someone out.",7
"DC fell at 158 for punjab's bowling yall, we got a real real chance here",14
"Exactly what we needed. Bairstow, Warner and Kane all scoring runs, some pinch hitting, now just need to bowl well and we are good.",12
Can SRH defend this? Brian Lara thinks they can!!,10
Shaun Pollock on cricbuzz predicted exactly 162 lol,12
"This Samad dude can really hit them, I think he can do a lot of damage against teams which do not have a death bowler as good as Rabada is.",11
"This is how poor captaincy can cost you a match. Examples

 - Axar did not bowl full quota despite being brilliant in the last two games.
 - Stoinis given needless over which should have gone to Rabada even if you wanted to bowl Stoinis.
 - Rabada, Nortje are strike bowlers who should be used when the batsman is new at the crease instead of following the template of saving them at the death. Then even folks like Samad come swinging and get one or two away.

Good captaincy would have restricted the score to less than 150.",6
"Classic SRH finish. Some people were saying we were whining when we're hitting at 5-6 rpo, you guys have something to add?",6
Kagiso with the 'that was a stupid ass question' body language,13
"3 required of last ball for DC and stoinis swings, edges it for a 4 & DC win.",4
"Yjb looked out of touch, but I have to assume the lack of depth is why he was so willing to play cautiously.... the dude destroys in ODIs at 110",6
This surface is literally made for Bhuvi. If he struggles today then I don‚Äôt know what else to say.,4
"Rabada low key wanted to be a boxer, now he's using the ball to hit people in the ribs.",3
Joint purple cap holder and economy just over run a ball as a death bowler. It‚Äôs just so fucking outstanding,8
Need to give credit where it's due. Delhi bowled wonderfully. SRH bowlers need to take a page or two from them and do their best today.,6
"Target: 160
SRH(2017) Could have defended it anyday.
SRH(2020) I have no fucking idea.",11
rabada is such fantastic bowler man. deserves every penny they're paying him.,7
We know the drill. Drag the game into 16th over and then Lord Chaos‚Ñ¢ reigns supreme. Don't do anything fancy.,7
"Any other team, I would say it's easily chaseable. I mean CSK did it in the first match on the same ground.

But this is Delhi. We are pretty much memeteam while chasing.",6
[deleted],0
[removed],9
"RCB fans, if you could have Rabada, which player from your team would you be willing to give up? And don't say Dube. Who would you be willing to give up to make it interesting for Delhi?",4
i love this man,4
That was really bad death overs batting,7
"NGL, Rabada seems like a super fun guy.",7
"If no batsman crosses 50 and DC wins, Rabada should be MoM",10
I can already see Samad getting a 50(21) against RCB,15
Rabada's face looks too small for his head.,3
That's the fucking reason why Kane should be in the playing 11 smfh. Also make him open with Warner and let Panday and Johnny bat at 3 and 4.,8
[deleted],6
SRH is the only team which scores less/equal runs in first and last 10 overs.,6
Expecting khaleel to get tonked by Shaw,4
purple cap hype,3
Over rate has been absolutely shit this IPL. Even with 2 timeouts it's 20 minutes over what it should take.,11
rabada best bowler in all formats rn,5
160 abu dhabi > 250 Sharjah,5
Is rabada the best bowler in IPL 2020 till now?,12
[removed],2
"Our bowling isn't at its best yet.. I don't feel confident with this total. Let's see, if our bowlers could step up.",7
Rabada is our most valuable player. He's so consistent Delhi should pay him more than any other player.,10
"If Bhuvi bowls well, SRH will defend anything, if not, then easy cruise by DC.",7
"I feel DC have the slight advantage here, with the SRH bowlers not really putting any kind of pressure in the last couple of matches, and with the DC batting order being really strong. Unless Bhuvi pulls through, I don't really know if SRH have a chance here.",4
"Clearly Kane needed more time, he had to go all out and take risks because it was the last few balls but he would have scored more runs if he came in earlier",7
Another short run against Delhi.. who's up for another super over!?,3
Wtf was that Andrex ad lmao,1
">Rabada says the pitch is two-paced. The square boundaries are quite big too. So you need to bowl into the wicket

>Rabada says it is a decent total, and that Sunrisers batted well for it

Was I the only one who was expecting a promotion for Rashid Khan to go and tonk the ball in the last over?,2
"Hey guys, fucking braindead maniac here. Why don't Delhi replace the pom hack Bairstow with Wriddhiman Saha????",2
[removed],0
Who the fuck calls baby over a mini over,10
[deleted],1
Why was Bairstow ever played above Kane. Kane is the Fab Four for Christ‚Äôs sake,4
I think Williamson should play at 3. I don't think he should accommodate his preferred position because an inferior batsman can't play lower down the order.,9
[deleted],2
"Big boundaries and slow pitches is textbook Big Bash League. Promotes safe, albeit sort of boring, cricket.",6

"Fun fact: despite sharing the same surname, Luke Shaw and Prithvi Shaw are not related.",14

Maaama Khallu Maama one wicket please.,2
Is pant getting the black band?,1
"Am I seeing the srh of 2018!? A decent score on the board, Bhuvi starting with a wicket and fielders pumped up!",5
"Have been running errands in and around a 3 mile radius from where I live. Every store with a television on main street was playing this IPL game. I don't think IPL in India has been more popular than this in any other season,",5
Pant has been known to butcher Rash. I'm apprehensive of the middle overs.,2
"Yeah, definitely choking this one. Out of nowhere pant will come out and then get out at the most crucial moment.",5
"DC went from 97 in 17 over to 158 in 20 in first game 
 
They shouldn't worry even if they don't score many in the pp",4
"I don't mind Prithvi being out rn, the best batsmen to anchor this runchase especially on this ground are there at the crease, Dhawan likes to rotate the strike until he's firmly set and Iyer is a similar bat. With Prithvi, Dhawan barely gets the strike because Prithvi isn't as adept at the strike rotation and it's either all boundaries or defence, which results in Dhawan trying to do something he's not capable of ala that switch hit from last match.

Warner and Bairstow showed the best way to score here is to run and run hard and run fast.",5
Lmao ishant at 9 is a worrying long tail,5
Unpopular opinion: Iyer is best player of Left arm pacer in Indian team. Starc & Boult would agree. Other Indian batters struggle sometimes,8
Is the plain Domino's cheese pizza a good one?,2
Iyer and dhawan are proper international players and they're batting against khaleel. If they can't smash him who are they gonna smash?,2
[deleted],2
Srh gonna win this one with their bowling and get back their confidence,4

Khaleel 'KITCHA SUDEEPA' Ahmed.,8
"One more wicket in the Powerplay, Boys. And we're in it.",5
Khaleel anna jerk iistundu.,5
"Where is the crowd audio coming from? 

Just got back to watching this year, out of the loop.",4
Nice to see Khaleel hit 140's. SRH needs that.,8
"Good over, khaleel",4
Wonder why Dhawan lets people like Shaw and Iyer farm the strike ahead of him.,6
"pant has become fucking huge. More so because he is short, he looks fucking chonky",8
I hate initial good overs while we are bowling. Brings back some worst flashbacks.,3
Al-khaleel great over üëç,1
"Aight time for meme conspiracy.

From what I noticed, the guy that threw the ball for that run out chance in Bhuvi's over is the only SRH player wearing blue shoes. He purposefully didn't aim at stumps because he's a DC sleeper agent.",13
lol that MI samsung ad on Hotstar is badly directed,4
"Quick glance at the scorecard, it appears Sunrisers got Australia series Bairstow...still churning out runs but not in that Jonny Bairstow-esque way we‚Äôve become accustomed too.

It‚Äôs less scoring runs for fun and more scoring runs due to a contractual obligation.",4
Whos the 5th bowler,1
khaleel's seam position is looking promising. should come out of 'discount ZK' tag,2
"For all those people saying Shaw should be dropped for Rahane - please kindly fuck off. Do u want your powerplay to be 20/0 after 6 overs because of a stat padder who hasn't won a match for his team since 2015? Shaw was MoM and players are bound to fail sometimes, they are only human. Dropping him for Rahane is reactionary as fuck.",2
Ohhhh. They don't have a sixth bowling option. Risky,2
The way Prithvi Shaw got out to Bhuvi is why I don't think he'll have a successful test career,5
Sublime shot!,1
Shikkaaar shuru?,2
Gabbar please show your class,1
thank you dhawan,1
"Say what you will, at least Sanjay Manjrekar had personality. Bangar is too bland and boring, I'd rather have Manjrekar blabber away there. It's like how I feel about PahulGill - they're annoying, but at least they're fun!",7
Bhuvi & Khaleel are both damn sex,3
"Cliche but Dhawan is a ""cool customer""",3
I'm sorry but I love watching Bhuvi get spanked around in ipl.,0
Fucking Shikhar must have practiced that in nets all the time with Bhuvi bowling.,7
Dhawan hitting a straight shot right after Sanjay Bangar said he can't. Some things write themselves,8
The Hulk would have hull smashed this total down to nothing by now,2
yes Gabbar punt it I know I didn‚Äôt listen to Mehbooba Mehbooba on loop for like an hour today for nothing,2
pitch looks slow and that is why even Warner/Bairstow were not playing that fluently. You have to bat creatively to score. May be need Pant to play a great innings to win today.,2
Dhawan drives are always pleasant,3
gAbBaR sLoW! dRoP hIm,3

Why do I get the feeling Kane is gonna bowl this game,10
The flying boob,10
That would have been sensational,4
He has caught exact same catch before! This time it was bit wide.,2
2 false shots already from Kaptaan. 163 is going to be tough,3
I think Bhuvi should bowl his 3rd over also now. Save one for last.,2
"Kagiso Rabada today became the first player to take multiple wickets in 10 consecutive IPL innings.

"Really like Warner‚Äôs captaincy,he‚Äôs always setting attacking fields,talking and encouraging his bowlers. In addition to that he‚Äôs a gun fielder and the best of all his fitness. No one else will be able to run so many twos and threes in this ground with such humid conditions",2

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

"Delhi Capitals fan downvoting. Chill, you're not out of this game yet",6
I have said this earlier and will say it again dhawan is not the one,5
Keep bowling to his wickets Rashid,5
the serial downvoter is getting stronger,2
Do I dare? Do I dare hope?,0
Never count any team out at any stage in cricket. Big Dick Energy Stoinis will smack Rashid left and right,4
Worst thing about downvoters is that you're forced to upvote mediocre comments too.,9
Glad we can hear Bairstow clearly today,8
Dhawan showing why he is India opener,4
DC being the real Deccan chargers. Haha,7
So they need to get to 70 by the 16th over sounds easy .We all know what happens after.,5
"Dhawan highlighting the problem most Indian batsmen have with spin these days, suddenly most of them have stopped using their feet against the spin.

Playing from the crease makes it so much more difficult against a spinner pitching it up",9
Iyer played a need less shot. SRH really have only two threatening bowlers - Bhuvi and Rashid.,3
Is Rishabh deliberately trying to do a Tewatia?!,20
"I‚Äôm upvoting guys, are you?",9
Is that arm really not bending over 15 degrees?,2
"Huhh...

The girl in Hotstar ad is cute",2
"If Prithvi Shaw is 20, I can totally believe that Rashid is 22 yo.",4
Dhawan acted well in that Dream 11 ad.,6
who bowls in death with bhuvi?,4
"I'm upvoting bois, **for the republic**",5
Dhawan straight up hard carrying here,4
This is a risky over. Either will be costly or wicket taking.,7
What's the point of downvoting? Like why would you do that?,2
Rashid looks like long lost brother of Virat,2
"BCCI master stroke: from annoying ass crowd sounds, they're inducing disgust in people for crowds, so they'll stay away from crowds",6
What happened to pant. He seems so calm,5
Yes stepping up is so important. I mean it's just necessary. Look how Ishan Kishan was playing spin yesterday. Also Rohit Sharma struggling hard...,4
"I wonder whether there is are bots which downvotes these comments? No way some users are the ones doing it everyday, Why would a bot do it?",5
Even Abhishek Sharma bowling well,0
Pant is such a chonker,2
Is Rashid Khan bending his arm a little? Is that legal?,4
"Some of you need to drink more water

Thirsty mofos",2
Why is it raining so much in blore?,2
pant is the game here.,1
"Good fielding Abhishek,don't give them chance to hit boundaries.keep the pressure on",8
I dont know but looks like his arm gets bent more than 15 degrees?,5
Sharma with good feeling.,0
Khaleel with his village fielding,5
That could have been caught by a better fielder.,1
Damn if only al-khaleel was 8 feet tall,3
"If I was in the dugout, I'd hit that annoying wicket alert anytime now",1
"Bayliss looks so gruffy, moody on the other hand, statesman of the game.",10
Khaleel is always hilariously awkward in the outfield,3
Coach sideline interviews are always so awkward across all sports,6
awkward silence,5
"Bayliss, doesn't seem keen does he",2
Just make 10 off Rashid‚Äôs 2 overs and we‚Äôll be left with 100 of 48 which is very chaseable with a set Dhawan and 5 overs between Natarajan and Abhishek,0
Does hotstar stream lag for everyone by a minute or so?,2
TB reminds me of Bill Belichik,0
Moody was class! I miss the man,8
Brilliant placement by Dhawan,4
This is painful to watch.,4
[deleted],1
‚ÄúIs that it?‚Äù,3
Keep going Abhishek,2
Bayliss didn't want to talk at all,13
"Lol Bayliss dissing the ""strategic"" timeout.",8
Bairstow innings doesn't seem too bad now does it?,6
Dhawan playing like number 10 against spin.,5
"Ahh fuck we don't luck on our side. Give us one free wicket, or a chace. We are small team god, pls give us one wicket",10
Why is Dhawan hitting these shots with backward short leg in place,2
"RR at 11.3, looks difficult on this pitch.",0
Awful run chase,0
Rishabh Tewatia pls,2
Is that it? Pure torture for him.,7
Is this when we go into CSK save the NRR mode?,0
Bring back Moody. Also did he resign thinking he might get selected as Indian coach?,3
"Every player this season, let's copy dhoni. Play cool, take the chase deep and smack it off


Dhoni-- I will play against the turn, I will do it better than them. I will strike only if the required runs of last over are above 40( u never know about noballs these days)",0
Warner really did have the plan. Bowled 3 overs from Abhishek easily.,1
"They aren't going to hit Rashid, Abhishek is bowling beautifully. 

I feel bad for Khaleel and Natrajan!! Bhuvi might get pounding too.",6
"There trying to save a test match here

Haha.

Dot dot single 2 dot single",0
Bayliss always looks like he has some grudges to settle.,10
"guys fun starts in over 15. till then, everyone chill!",6
Wicket this over.,2
"Worst ads - Cred, bacche ko bachao, fanfight. Please add others",2
Wheels are coming off. DC looks miserable.,3
"""How much do you use the player to player match-ups?""

Bayliss: Ehh, here and there. <awkward silence>",1
"We have seen this, it‚Äôs not the dot balls or singles that‚Äôll do it..it‚Äôs the wickets! This partnership should be broken asap for srh to have any chance",3
Youd think Dhawan would play rash better,1
12 an over on this pitch looks really difficult,-1
Pant is taking it deep it seems,-1
So everyones Tewatia now!,0
What a terrible run chase so far,-2
Some of the production and professionalism from the commentary team has been so cringeworthy. Is it that bad or have I been spoiled by the Sky boys?,4
Dugout doing the wicket alert like it's a club lol,4
Any plans to accelerate there DC? Tewatia isn't in your team.,-2
Watch it be 90 from 30 again and rishabh goes off,1
This is boring after the last two matches,1
Johnny with the review,1
Out out out outm review it. Warner is not sure.,-1
If pant and dhawan can't play Rashid well I doubt hetmyer can,1
Why would you want to get Dhawan out? Madness.,0
Fantasy points are such a joke when Kano is ranked at 5th.,4
Both Pant and Bairstow have signalled for a review this game lmao,3
Umpire reviewed it right? Not the team,-2
RASHID you beauty,4
Dhawan plays with an above average strike rate in ODIs and plays with a below average strike rate in T20s. Why though?,3
So many player reviews w/o consulting the captain lol,6
If the pacers give a decent start then only Rashid can be effective and the batting don‚Äôt have the liberty of playing him out and they try to attack him and get out as visible today,2
Do you guys think IPL 2019s pant fits this year's pant,0
Did they mess up in not sending their bowlers out to bat?,3
tbh dhawan could probably do the 103 off 54 himself actually,-4
bad review i think,-4
Spike boys,3
"Yeah I think he is gone, there was a sound. Fuck there is. Out",1
Oh that's gone,1
Get innnnn!!,0
this chase has been poorly paced so far. They need more boundaries,4
Out ?  Yeah.,-1
Well done Jonny,8
wow. good call!!,2
Howazzat????,1
Looks out,1
Meh were fucked,4
"The wicket alert worked, too a good team for it do so, lovely old job (loj)",1
He hit it!,2
"Holy shit Rashid going insane today, feels like 2018 hyderabad with Warner again",8
[deleted],8
"Wow, I thought its an appeal for stumping",8
Either these are super faint edges or ultraedge needs some recalibration,6
"Need 11.65 an over on this pitch against these bowlers. It‚Äôs been tough since ball one. Kane is truly class. The only one that made batting look easy on this track. Hell or High Water, SRH should play him every game.",7
Masterful review from the ginger,20
"Called it, called it! Dhawan was getting uncomfortable",5
"Lmao, thank god for DRS. I swear every initial decision against SRH is wrong. Terrible umpiring tbh",8
Now is where the match gets really interesting,6
This wicket might actually be a bad thing for us.,3
Thank God for drs,2
Man I love how Bairstow is a real-life mascot for SRH,6
"The way Dhawan was playing spin, it was inevitable.",3
"Binga got a wicket alert right , what is this madness ?",2
Behenchodddd,1
"What a lucky break for Delhi, Dhawan‚Äôs blocking out of the way, Stoinis on the way",6
Not the one we wanted but a wicket nonetheless,2
"Guys just like the one-run cheer, DJ also has a button that will flash a message on commentators screen that says ""Call in the bowling team coach for meaningless chat""",3
Gg Hyderabad well played. We really need someone other than Shaw who knows how to score quick.,4
Did YJB lag before appealing so confidently,4
Vintage Rashid!,2
Okay am i the only one who sees the bent in Rash's elbow ?,2
"That was pretty late reaction!

Delhi is going to collapse, don't they?",7
There is no crowd in the stadium.  How do you miss hearing those edges? Hmm.,5
"Dance my biriyani Bois. We got a wicket. Good catch YJB, even Rashid wasnt appealing at first",7
How do you think Rahane spends his time in the dug out?,1
tbf binga got it right two matches in a row lol,2
Excellent review,3
ohh shit i thought they were going for a stumping! lmaoo,1
"Rasode mai kaun tha

Rashid thaaaaa",7
"Win the toss, dont.. fucking chase",3
"The ball didn‚Äôt move. Did it touch the bat? (I‚Äôm neutral here, I‚Äôm just wondering)",-2
"Hetmyer before Stoin? Yikes, Stoin will need a few balls to get in on this wicket. He ain't going from ball 1",1
Haar gaye bc,-1
"**11.3** Rashid Khan to Dhawan, OUT, wrong'un outside off, and Dhawan tries the slog sweep only to be beaten. Bairstow appeals both for catch and stumping. Given not out, and they review it. So I assume the appeal is now for the catch. And it has hit the toe end of the bat. Great review. Dhawan has to go **62-3**

S Dhawan c &dagger;Bairstow b Rashid Khan 34 (31b 4x4 0x6) SR: 109.67",1
"Wait a second, why is the review lost when the decision is overturned. Shouldn't the review be lost only when the team who decided to take the review get it wrong?",2
Either Hetmeyer wins us this or Carey comes in for next game,1
"@heymeyer  
jahan se hona chahiye  
wahin se hai tu thicc",2
"Weird calibration on Ultraedge today... very small spike for an edge, at least it shows the spike earlier was definitely a glove?",4
Rashid has been absolutely sublime these last two matches,6
Alright. Its all over now. Or it'll be a super over. With DC u can never sleep. Fckkk,4
Thiccboys,6
"Today is Hetmyer redemption day, get ready",4
There‚Äôs a lot of arse in this partnership,3
Rashid‚Äôs arm is bending but I don‚Äôt think leg spinners really benefit from throwing.,2
Gotta love a collapse,6
What has happens to Dhawan? He used to score so briskly,3
Suddenly our batting feels so weak. These sloggers man ffs.,3
We will chase to lose the match!,2
Even tewewtia can't review them now. What a chutiya chase!,1
"baby you are my cvv i am your otp  


wicket fell baby wicket fell",9
"I hope Hetmeyer doesn‚Äôt play like he against SRH last year in their final game. His only good IPL innings ever, won a nearly unwinnable game.",2
HITmeyer leggo,2
Get Hetmyer quickly please.,4
Hetmeyer ain't lasting long as well imo,3
"I think We might have a solid chance but upon watching the recent matches, I won't say anything too early.",4
Hetmyer fucked us in the last group stage game of 2019. I'm still salty.,5
How is pant so overrated? I've never seen him play a big innings.,-1
hat myre,2
Hetmyer is the kid from that weird Josh app ad,3
Hetmeyer need to prove today or f off,2
"Time to follow the footsteps of your fellow West Indian, Shimron. I would take the Pollard innings from yesterday!",7
Time for Mr Cheeks to shine,3
[removed],11
His IPL stats are Shitmeyer,10
Iyer has been atrocious today from the toss to the batting.,6
"Logic: guy whose arm is tired holding a paintbrush, will now hold a child for painting the roof.

J0sH...",13
Pant is not even trying take run. He is very dangerous,8
Pant and Hetty on the crease,7
"I'll never ever have the confidence (or the stupids) to carry that hairstyle. So, so weird looking.",11
"Hetmyer is going to play a stupid shot here and get out. Similar to pant, loads of talent but weak mentally",5
"IIRC, his only fifty came against SRH last season?",8
Rashid looks unplayable,10
looks like hetmyer gained some weight.,11
Rash is such an entertainer!,7
This match is DC's real test of character and temperament. Can they chase this down?,6
Hetmyer and his mamasita ass.,9
Rashid you beauty <3,3
Great bowling performance from Khan,2
Hetmyer- cause of ptsd to SRH fans,3
Rishabh spent lockdown eating paranthas  and manchurian,8
Great over!,1
Also you love to see Warner trusting his BFF Bairstow right away and reviewing,11
"The wicket ball or the ""blue ball"" that was bowled! Thanks Sanjay",2
Everybody ask where is SRH middle order. Boiiiisss Rashid is our middle order.,4
"This is it for Hetmyer, to complete the ex-RCBian redemption arc he needs to go big.

Also for Pant after yesterday's Kishan innings, ""tera khoon kab khaulega re Pant""",3
This game reminds me of SRH from a few years ago where they would win purely based on their bowling.,6
Attack anyone not named Rashid like now!,1
[removed],4
"To everyone saying Rashid has a bent elbow. That is allowed, you just cannot change the angle during the bowling action",7
Hetmyer had one good inning last year with RCB. He comes with hype. Will he take DC home?,3
Pant: Tewatia mode on...,10
THICC,6
Tera pyar pyar pyar hookah maar!!!!,2
Wtf is that haircut?,3
"Pant and Hetmeyer at the same time üò≥üò≥

Battle of the Booties ü§§",10
Man I've never seen Pant in full flow. Always heard of it. I think he's over hyped. Samson looks more assured of his game.,0
"Abhishek keep the pressure on buddy, no need to take wickets just don't give boundaries",4
[deleted],4
Lmao!,1
"Lmao, Abhishek Sharma's 4th over.

Lil rabbit Warner's tricks paying off",4
Rashid needs to at least be reported for a suspect action and just get it checked. I‚Äôm 99% sure he‚Äôs chucking.,0
Utter rubbish batting going on..,2
pant choking,3
This has set up for a Stoinis special,2
At least hit one six to show some sort of effort in this run chase,3
Abhishek is a really clever bowler.,3
This is the point where I turned off telly the last two days thinking the games were pretty much dead. Not gonna make the same mistake tonight.,8
That was a good review by Bairstow. Warner and the umpire couldn't hear the nick because of fake crowd noises.,3
What the fuck is up with dug out and wicket alert?,2
Good start to the over. Lovely bowling Abhishek,2
Pant is hilarious.,1
Sachet bhai kya kar rahe ho,5
Two thick bois,1
Hetmyr looks like he carries his entire travel luggage in his ass,9
Fuck,1
Ohhhhh fuck dropped it?,5
"Petition for a show following Bairstow and Warner around

Call it The Adventures of Jonny and Davey",7
PanTewatia incoming!!,6
Dropped him,1
"What have you done, Logan!",3
Pant /DC don't have the luxury of the Kotlas small boundaries,1
Did he drop it?,2
Dropped it,2
I want to know what is the plan here? To score only in last five overs?,5
You don‚Äôt drop Rishabh Pant young man,2
This is the worst run chase this IPL. Even the comebacks in the last few days they were swinging. These guys are playing for singles,-3
Signals ...pant is going to gooooo,4
Pant about to channel his inner tewatia,5
Pant Tewatia,2
First 6 of this IPL for Pant I believe,6
And now c√ªnted away to six. Lol,3
"C+b chance probably should've been taken

Nice slog sweep from Pant there",5
You don't give guys like pant a chance. Would have been out in the previous ball.,8
As long as Pant is batting it's still on. He's like DC' Dre Russ.,7
Fucking cunted it. Pant should not get going,7
"***Suddenness. The sheer suddenness of the downvote, the unexpected nature of the downvote, the unpredictability of the downvote.  They don't know what hit them. Now the match thread users will know***",12
Pant channeling his inner Tewatia,1
Costly drop,2
Bc saare dhai dhai kilo biryani kha ke aaye hai aaj... Sluggish as fuck today,3
"The drop has liberated Pant, 6 6",7
Which team was abhishek Sharma in prior to SRH? Never really heard of him till now,4
"Okay, they are hitting, we don't have a chance.",6
Pant is going to have a field day vs Natarajan and Kaleel. I honestly bowl Kane here,10
throws sink,0
Oof good 22 balls Sharma and then 2 bad ones,6
Pant ke andar mata aa gayi,4
Pant is a good guy. First he gives you a chance and only then hits you.,6
pant's favorite shot.,6
This the pant we know and love,8
"Haha, Pant silencing r/cricket users rnüòÇ",7
Cricket is a cruel game,8
That drop will hurt SRH,7
Pantewatia,6
Really good spell made to look average by just 2 balls.,7
Thanks for that drop Abhi. Very cool.,5
thats enough now ... hold him back or get him out,4
"Binga please go for another wicket alert, last time you did Dhawan got out.",7
Why is Kanos sitting in the dugout lol,8

Pant‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you regret dropping that catch‚Äú,5
good thinking from warner to get sharma's overs out of the way.,2
"



PANT > Kishan+Samson",-1
PanTewatia is IN!!,3
Pant had 1 too many biryanis during the lockdown,7
"Yeah baby , if pant is in form he alone is enough",9
Drop catch and 2 sixes straight after that.,13
Love to see Harsha getting all excited for SRH.,12
We've got PANNTTTT...RISHABHHHH PANTTT,4
Nattu has Yorkers good sign,6
Go big or go home time for Hetmeyer,6

Hetmeyer really let himself go.,1
Hahahhahaha aaaaahahahhahaha,2
BC you are giving free runs. What is that,2
Tf,1
"Looking at these 160 odd chase, feel that Nitish Rana played a gem of innings the other night. Someone who can strike at 200 and up the ante in the first 10 overs, makes chase relatively easier for batsmen to follow.",3
jizzbox is yet to cum,1
"Petition to play Mambo no 5 more on T20s, that song is a serious banger",1
Oh fuck you man. It's going to be insane from here.,4
Yeah... That catch miss is going to hurt dearly,6
Hahaha kill me,6
"I don't care if we lose, if we get to see Pant on song",4
is it possible some day that we we only go for super overs in knockout..maybe too many and it would lose its charm? each team gets 1 point each.,3
Game over for SRH. You can't drop Pant and expect to get away with it,6
You can't stop that. That's a Pisa poor bowling,6
They need to stop giving freebies,6

Hetymer's ass is not propionate to his body.,5
Just about to say Natranjan has been pretty decent in this IPL and he bowls a full toss,2
Did Hetmeyer deny the strike?,3
What's the record for most matches lost before registering a point ? RCB has 7 probably not sure though.,2
Shorty running by Hetmyer.,2
Nehra on Hindi commentary just said yorker is the most overrated delivery in T20s...,5
Our boy Nattu has killer yorkers,5
Another roller coaster of a chase on?,3
SRH orange cap always confuses me with top scorers orange cap.,2
Just one bad ball in there. Long way to go from here.,1
Natarajan be like every 4 hit is a 6 saved.,4
Great yorkers boi,2
Lol.. it made sense for bairstow and warner..you two fatasses aint running for shit,3
Both too fat to run two,6
Yes!! Keep them Yorkers coming.,3
Damn nattu is going good at the yorkers,2

Natrajan and Khaleel are the weak links in the bowling.,1
I need a redemption arc for hetmeyer....,2
Pls shave that neckbeard,3
Yorker specialist,4
Seeing Swann always get over excited about that piece of shit car makes me crack up.,3

This is a quality commentary trio,8

"Woah, Ian Bishop has like a notebook and all.",4
"People diss on Pant because he doesn't play conventional cricket and wonder why India doesn't get innovative players like England, South Africa or Australia. He is not pleasing to watch most of the times but his track record is still better than likes of Kishan and Samson.",9
Natarajan is just like TNPL '' okay but boring'',3
Awful Neckbeard jeez,5
Lol he only has a good yorker and everything else is average.,6
Swanny and shilling for Indian cars. Name a cringier duo lol.,6
Who's the dugout commentator getting a hard-on everytime the Altroz is on screen?,10

Those are some crushing yorkers in the over.,5
"Good effort, we still got Rashid over right?",2
"Bishop: Yorker is very difficult to bowl.

Us: Bumrah, why don't you just bowl six Yorkers, you idiot.",6
Swann jerks off to altroz,3
If he only has a good yorker why can't he bowl a yorker every ball?,1
"This guy has such an amazing Yorker,why not just bowl that every ball why try something stupid?",1
Those Yorkers... Oof,1
SRH really lacking a good fast bowler. Hopefully Holder will help.,4
"What's up with Rashid chucking comments ?

I thought Leg spinner could never chuck",3
Good bowling except for that one stray.,3
If hetmyer doesn't show up today then he can go back to Guyana. Guy is all hype,3
Natarajan is nailing the length. If only he was a little bit quicker he would be really threatening.,10
Devudu Paine baaram vesnaam,7
"How can you say SRH has shit bowling with Rashid Khan, Bhuvi, Lord Khaleel in the team
The other two aren't bad either",6

Umesh Yadav Lite = Khaleel,-1

Not 3 days in a row,1
Lol that wasn't a wide,3
Khaleel has such a sad demeanour lol,7
I have a bad feeling about this khaleel's over.,2
Nattu has like bowled more yorkers than our Boomer.,2
SRH Need to win this. Their next match is against CSK Thala gonna smash these Indian bowlers otherwise. They need confidence of this match. Dhoni feeds on nervousness. Ask Corey Anderson üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ,0

Simran needs to live his a life a little now I reckon,8
Khaleel with an Yorker,4
Man Rishab has gotten fat. Koach aint gonna like this.,4
"When even a lockdown can't make Khaleel put on weight and gain some muscles, I don't know what can.",5
"Even Khaleel nailing his Yorkers. This is the old SRH who would defend even 120-130 scores

Edit: I stand corrected. Lord Khaleel ftw",6
Not watching the game. Why are DC batting so slow?,4
This guy is shit ofc,3
Lol At Bish sticking to referring to himself in third person,0
Cmon yaar khaleel...,1
Kane is a gun fielder and he might be giving some very good suggestions to bowlers while Davey is saving some runs at long on/off. He should be on the field,2
Je baat,-1
"That's why bowlers don't bowl yorkers every ball

If you miss, you get hit for 6",13
Sux,2
Only khaleel can bring hetmyer back to form. Fuck me. We aren't gonna win this either,3
Kaleel auditioning for Dinda academy,2
"It‚Äôs hard not to respect David Warner the cricketer, especially when it comes to the IPL.",7
great the second fat ass is getting in on it too...,2
Death overs should be renamed Tewatia overs for this edition,9
Why is Rishab Pant running like Inzamam and declining singles. He needs to be in better shape considering he is just 22,6
Damn son,1
Oh yes Shimron,1
Snoozefest,0
SRH bowlers nailing the Yorkers. Reason? Muralitharan is their Bowling coach ‚ù§Ô∏è,2
Khaleel never disappoints,7
Hetwatia,6
That's a brilliant shot,2
Man this guy has another over! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,5
Simran.,5
Harsha is on another gear when commenting on SRH,3
Khaleel sucks. You stupid bitch,-1
Khaleel doing what he does best.,3
Lord khaleel,3
Discount Zaheer lol,4
Left arm bowler to left hand batsmen this IPL hasn't been a rosy journey...,1
Imagine getting an IPL contact because you bowl with your left hand,3
"Once again, unchasable is getting chased.",3
TONKED,3
Kaif taking notes : khaleel ki le li bc,6
What a shot!! Everyone keeps shitting on him but boy he has immense talent,2
These Carribean left handers have ungodly power and hella flair... Gotta give respect,5
Khaleel sucks üòÄ,7
We are fucked,4
bhuvi and rashid will save srh.,2
Khaleel you clown,7
Classic case of r/cricket jinxing someone,8
My boys are feasting,2
"Fuck off khaleel, BC. Throwing like a kid. WTF are doing. Wasting all the hardwork by other bowlers to waste",9
"I am shocked, I tell you! Shocked! Did not expect this from Khaleel. /s",4
yea DC gonna chase this with 2 overs to spare.,2
khalil you ........,1
Atleast Sid Kaul took wickets but Khaleel doesn't seem to take wickets as well,6
He quote clearly has a good Yorker but chooses to bowl a short ball. Fucking retarded,1
Why is Kane sitting,3
That's better,2
"SRH campaign is done. 


See you next year when they buy Fast bowlers üòûüòûüòûüòûüòûüòûüòû",4
"Khaleel is shit? Ah, 2020 is returning to normal.",3
"Rashid and Khaleel with two more overs to bowl against two lefties, oh no",4
Why is Kane sitting out?,3
Wtf is kaif writing everything is available on many cricket sites.,2
C'mon DC,1
"And here we go. Khaleel and shit bowling, what a pair.",4
"Common boys, last team defeating top team would be fun !!",2
Khaleel suss,3
"I said many times that RCB need to drop Umesh to increase their chances of winning matches, SRH need to drop Khaleel",1
"Just to clarify why nehra said yorker overrated

He said that in current scenario i.e 14th over and he is right yorker is good in death overs not in 14th over. He said you can control runs but cant take wickets.",4
"Made no fap challenge if srh win, seems like it's going to be off",3
"death, taxes and Khaleel being shit",4
Hell yeah another night of madness with these two bad boys catching fire,2
"Considering how the last couple of games went, I think DC  has this in the bag. 61 off 39 doable.",2
"Finally, time for hetmyre to improve his IPL stats. It doesn't suit him.",3
coach wtf lol?,2
I'm not going to switch off the TV after 15th over today,4
RCB bowler to RCB batsman. I'm just gonna sit back and enjoy lol,1
"you have to get one more out of khaleel it seems 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

harsha why you do dis",3
This MF got only two variations,2
"Ya K Khaleel, you are just shit.",1
Idk why but I always get sadistic pleasure when Khaleeel gets smacked. Maybe because I dont consider him good enough to be in the national team and he always somehow finds place in it thanks to him being a leftie even though he is shit bowler.,3
Do they have a pun for every player in the league?,3
Pant LMAO,3
"I was just casually mentioning to my friend that Khaleel has improved . Looks to have developed control and consistency . Might be a good pick in our fantasy teams .

Within minutes - two sixes back to back .

The Love Hate continues .",13
Hetymer looks like that fat rich kid who comes in an SUV to play gully cricket,32
The bowler and the batsmen are younger than me. Feeling old,8
Hetmyer's ass>Kardashian's ass,22
Pant full entertainment,3
Trevor for me looks like a too laidback coach.,4
With one more Khaleel over to go DC are in with a chance,6
Thank you Khal Drogo. Phew,5
khaleel and his chutiya bowling,1
Poor running this,2
Khaleel back to his original form,3
Lord Khaleel at it again,3
Khaleel pulled of a Tewatia!!! He was slow at first but now he is a legend ! Well done khaleel,5
Lol Khaleel,1
SRH Bowlers: *There's an imposter among us*,7
I'm glad the SRH knuckle ball era is over,1
Why the f are all players attempting a Dhoni lately,5
"My money on Delhi from here, looks fairly straightforward with 3 big hitters around",3
"Four good yorkers, 2 bad balls. I still think that's the best most bowlers can do.",6
No running between the wickets lmao,2
"59 of 30 should be easy, right?",3
50 off 5 should be easy. Our game to lose from here.,6
Shocking running between the wickets from these two chubsters,5
"Ja shimron ja, jeele apni zindagi",3
"Harsha Bhogle ‚ÄúQQKHALEEEL, from the epiglottis‚Äù",6
60 of 30 looks nothing now,2
"Has he done that shitty ""call the selectors"" celebration yet?",2
This pepsi ad is one of the cringiest ad evers,2
should give Bhuvi the next over,1
Wtf i thought pant was the one denying singles. Its actually been hetmyer all along,3
Saving Rashid for defending 4 off the last over. Big brain from Warner,5
khaleel is too beta man. gotta strike some fear in the batsman as a fastbowler.,5
I don't want to believe that IPL is fixed but how the fuck is this happening game after game?,4
Sanjay used bemused correctly - made me tear up.,2
"One of them needs to go if srh wants to win this ..  


and khaleel sure as fuck ain't gonna get you that wicket",1
Bruh to left handers and Kane is not bowling on a slow deck,2
Caught up to pant in half the balls.,6
All Hope's on bhuvi,1
I might just download Cred for the amazing adverts,2
Now khaleel will pull off a tewatia by taking a hattrick in his next over,3
"Shimron Hetmyer be like ""I wanna run doubles but the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the opposition""",7
"This is DC match's to loose now, which is good news for SRH because DC will loose a match from winning position.",5
And stoinis isn‚Äôt even here yet,3
Wickets it is. Nothing else can win this for SRH.,9
As a DC supporter I'm not gonna watch the match as I may potentially jinx it,6
FUCKING HELL BHUVIIIIIIII,6
Bhuvi :),3
Stupid stupid shot..,1
[removed],7
Hetmyer is the master of throwing wickets away :),3
Phew!,3
"Yes bitch, finally. Bhuvi love you",9
FFS,2
Hetmyer outüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,3
Bad shot. Very bad,3
I love Harsha Bhogle when he does SRH matches. Love,8
Warner to Khaleel : band karo band karo khule hagna band karo,6
Bhuvi delivers,3
Pandey ji specialist fielder,4
Stoinis plssssss,1
Yay!,2
Koach this is how you use your bowlers take notes,5
"Thought he'd made a meal of that catch tbh

Massive wicket, well bowled Bhuvi",3
Nice slow ball from Bhuvi.,1
Bhuvi pls don‚Äôt be afraid of Pant.,3
What the fuck? Where is Rashid?,1
The DJ started with Stayin Alive and has now reached hookah bar.,8
Cometh the hour cometh Stoinis,3
oh bhuvi my bhuvi,2
Probably saving rashid for stoinis,5
Ponting preparing his dressing room speech,8
"Cool af, Pandey Bro.",7
A West Indian for a West Indian,2
"Manish , goti muh meh agaya.",8
"Okay Delhi Fanbois.
How many times will we have to remind youu..Ur team is not dependable at all",3
Stoinis bout to clap some SRH cheeks,5
"Bhuvi and Rashid. 5.1 overs, 17 runs, 4 wickets.",16
shimmy shimmy,4
What could be the average age of people on this sub?,5
Stoinis we‚Äôre gonna need some of that bicep power please,3
Manish Pandey doing what he does best.. fielding.,7
Rohit and Shreyas traitors for playing Fifa instead of Cricket 07,4
Nice fielding boys,2
SPECIALIST FIELDER,6
"C'mon Bish, answer the question, why is the yorker such a hard ball to bowl?",1
"During SRH's golden years Bhuvi was ably supported by Kaul and Sandeep. They don't have anyone now, not even Kaul and Sandeep.",2
Fuck this time out!,2
Stoin we need you again,1
Uhhhh is Warner actually holding Rashid back for the last over or something,2
dat ass though ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞),8
Fuck off with the time outs cunts,5
"**15.1** Kumar to Hetmyer, OUT,  **104-4**

SO Hetmyer c Pandey b Kumar 21 (12b 0x4 2x6) SR: 175.00",7
Stoinis fck this shit up my man. Kill em all.,3
Pandey almost dropped the match there. But fuck me Stoinis is out now,6
Atleast gave some momentum to the chase. Keeps his place for one more match,5
oh jesus don‚Äôt remind me about tomorrow,3
Shimron kardeshian hetmeyer,11
I think the outside off to hitmyer was the plan. Khaleel just couldn't execute it. Gave too much timing.,6
Pandey is seriously our best fielder his drop rate is also really low,10
Rcb strikes back,3
"Bhuvi must have gotten a boner when he looked at this pitch, he‚Äôs relishing bowling here, making mockery of the top-order batsmen",8
"tbh that was good from hetmeyer. dc needed someone to speed things up and relieve pressure form pant, and he did that.",5
As an RCB fan I can finally relax and watch in peace,11
Oh no we are up against Lord Tewatia tomorrow,12
Hulk time,3
RR playing outside Sharjah for the first time tomorrow,6
"That being said, looks like Boobie is gonna overdo the slower balls and get hammered again.",3
What are they saving Rashid for?,2
"Harsha with the Sass on Bishop. When it's SRH, Harsha rides too close to the sun doesn't he?",3
Finally a wicket,2
Hetmyer is talented but no brains,4
Lmao I had given up all hope on srh and now they're going to beat one of the best teams,10
What a terrible shot,1
stoinman gonna chase this in 2 overs from here.,5
"No one. 
Literally no one.....


Hetmyer c√πnts first ball of Bhuvi 
ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",8
"Bumrah, Bhuvi, Saini in t20s, replace Bhuvi with Shami for odis.",6
Don't hype up stoinis he's 100% giving his wicket to Rashid,7
This is our last batting pair. They gotta strike a 40 runs partnership at least.,4
This wicket was a result of setting up that shot. This ball was just a bit slower than the previous one in khaleel over.,6
SRH and RCB fans are distant cousins lol,14
Strategic timeout is real shit. One is atleast fine but two in a single inning. SMH,10
Once the 2nd Fattie gets outt..Game set and Match for SRH ?!,1
"I was concerned and now it's been confirmed, this team can't chase anything more than 180. I don't think we should be considered top favourites at all.",1
"It feels everything is right with the world when the lead bowlers do their job of taking wickets, immediately into their over",11
Stoiks,1
"Question - can wank also be used a synonym for shit? Like ""They have a wank privacy policy"".",4
Imagine if BBL was IPL and Kohli was banned for Sandpaper. Would he got back his Royal Challengers Adelaide captaincy back?,13
What the fuck are these Josh ads?,1
DC would be wishing they'd retained Tewatia now.,6
"Pointing needs to have a serious word with hetmyer. He‚Äôs arguably the most talented young player in the world, needs to work on his mental game",9
"No pace from Bhuvi, the ball from Khaleel on a similar line that was hit for six was quicker, and shorter.",3
SRH winning would be good for the IPL,14
"Thanks to these last few matches, no target looks safe now.",7
Why is Kane not fielding? Injured?,4
Shimron do be havin a thiccc ass,5
Bhuvi and Rashid are what made SRH bowling so formidable. Nice to see them both getting back into form.,9
I believe Pant will win this,1
Hindi isn't my native language but does anyone refer to their guard as Guard Bhayya?,6
"Come on Stoinis, drawn SRH in the sea of your jizz",4
"Damn seriously what is going on with the fitness in DC... Shaw , pant , hetmeyer",3
Shit who got out?,1
Another example why strategic time out is unnecessary,4
"for that gloster add... i hate to say this but ...that kid is dumb as fuck ...  


all dumb guesses for abbreviations..which are themselves cringe as fuck",3
Tewatia : ·ïô‡ºº‚óïŸÑÕú‚óï‡ºΩ·ïó,2
"At least the Josh app ad is honest, showing us how unfunny their ad is, no chance I will download the app for more such unfunny videos",2
You have hot girl in a pink dress and you watch the match? You deserve the hand bro.,3
"So, body shaming is a norm here now?",2
Lol Warner saving one over of Rashid for Stoinis.,5
Chain Kulii Ki Main Kulii is the greatest sports movie ever made don't @ me,5
"Knockout teams will be:

RR
DC
RCB
KXIP",8
Do the Tewatiaa Pant boyy,3
Fuckin what Pant's only 22?,4
That's some PTSD!,4
why pant playing like jadhav lol?,5
Damn Pant made Bhuvi his bitch in 2018,5
"If only Abhishek caught that , SMH. We would have a chance in this match. These two will go berserk",6
Oof,1
"Here we go, we r fucked",3
now get that weird little aussie who might ruin this for us..,3
Winning of SRH would provide balance to points table,7
Pant and Gill are same age? Tells you the talent of Pant and expectations from him,4
Oye bhenchod,3
Stoinis the Moinis!,1
Big dick stoinis,1
told ya,1
Lets go Stoin,1
Overdoing the slower balls as predicted. When will he learn!,1
Get Stoins wicket boobie,3
Chad,2
Sexy stoin,1
You sexy stoin,2
Stoinis should bat at 3. In this form we are simply wasting him. Iyer should bat at 5.,2
I am scared of Stoinis. This batting lineup is very stacked,7
im telling youuuu. stoinis is gonna be the costliest buy next season.,1
Inb4 Mar kas pun on Hindi commentary,3
Will pant pull off a dhoni or a tewatia?,4
They're talking about his biceps lol,3
Gg boys it was fun while it lasted :),8
"Honestly this is pretty chasable as much as I want SRH to win ,they need a wicket in the next 2 overs.",3
Lol stoinis is jacked,2
"50 off 25 seems very get-able, what has this IPL done",5
"As someone who isn't too involved with Australian cricket, what's the deal with stoinis and zampa? Are they actually rumored to be hooking up or is it just a meme?",5
Why was Stoinis never so good for us,8
SRH got 1 over of Rashid to take Stoinis out. Else it's gonna be difficult for SRH,6
"When Stoinis plays for Australia, he almost never hits a four in the first ten balls.",13
Stoinis the mannis is going to absolutely twat us,6
DC's got some good ass players.,10
[removed],5
Stoinis looks bit like hero Abbas(Premadesam).,4
So Khaleel will be the given the last over it looks like.,3
Pant playing tuk tuk,2
powaa pant,1
Pant stop doing fancy stuff lmao,1
The way Bhuvi bowls determines how well the sunrisers are bowling - Harsha Bhogle,9
Sexy shot that Panty,1
53 off 26 is chase-able by SRH considering they have Pant and Stoinis. SRH need to get one of these quickly.,3
What is kaif writing ?,2
We're still fucked mates,3
"Where is this confidence when Stoin plays for Australia down the order? I don't get it, he'd have dead batted that 1st ball down to his feet if he was playing for Aus",5
How does every ball not fly into the stands when Big Biceps Stoin hits it?,1
Is SRH giving me hope?,4
I get the need for innovation and it works but sometimes you just need to cunt it down the ground like that,2
York the fucker out Boobie,3
DC has it in bag folks.,1
Need a wicket,1
49 in 4 ... tall mountain but not an Everest,3
Should give Rashid the next over imo,0
How hard was that hit!,1
Rashid and Khaleel overs will decide the match,3
Harsha praising the batsman and also expressing our feelings. What a player.,6
"Pant and stoins is picking and hitting Bhuvi, they will masscare my boi Khaleel. Pray for him.",3
Is SRH this year's RCB?,7
Isn‚Äôt Stoinis supposed to Aussie MSD?  Just few days back we were all shitting on him on Eng Aus match thread about his slow starts. And now he is scoring boundaries from ball 1.,3
Bhuvi of 2017 was such a gun death bowler ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠,2
Pant gonna attack Rash as usual and succeed as usual.,2
Man Pant has a LOT of power.,2
"Ek hi dil hai, Kitni baar jeetoge Bhuvi bhai <3üíï",1
I really like how this stadium looks,4
u/RLKay really pains me to say this. But feels like Bhuvi is a shadow of his past. The lack of yorkers from him is deeply upsetting.,3
Who‚Äôs gonna bowl now? Should be Rashid,1
Pant is definitely a better player (in all formats) than Samson and Ishan Kishan,3
Welp one Khaleel over left. Thats the game.,3
Pant scored 44 of 11 against Bhuvi when he was barely 20.,7
Afghani Chad Rashid has got this or Aussie Chad stoinis got the stonks,1
oh no it‚Äôs rashid I‚Äôm scared,1
Should bowl rashid now while stoinis is new to crease,0
"Idk who will win

This is the IPL. Anything is possible.",2
One 20 run over and 29 off 18 which is quite doable.,3
"Hetmyer hasn't fired until now. A few signs are there in this game that he is getting his touch back. This DC line up will become more dangerous once he gets into his groove.

Pant, Hetmyer and Stoinis taking care of the 2nd half of the innings.",0
The dropped catch might cost the game.,2
"DC top order ate way too many balls, just like the last match. It will be really hard for them to defend or score on a pitch like yesterday they also have lowest run rate in the powerplay 4.5 or something.",1
49 of 4 looks too easy after MI scored 79 last night,3
Not Rashid pls be scares me,0
Would a Brohit sized Stoinis be as attractive as muscular Stoinis?,0
This is what we in the business like to call a BIG OVER‚Ñ¢,4
Rashid and Pant are playing against each other since U19 times!!,9
"Rashid enters. 

*Boss music playing*",3
This is the make or break over for SRH,3
This is the over that sets the match,1
I don't know how much is safe with Khaleel. Like anything is possible with his over.,3
"Leftie Be Leggie

Ohh I love it",2
"This will be the make or break over I reckon. If he keeps it tight giving away just 5-6 runs, then it will SRH's to lose. If DC takes him apart, gg",2
Here's hoping another cracker like yesterday!,2
Lets see if Stoinis makes those biceps to use,1
Don't give strike to pant. Rashid jeed to take stoins,0
"We need at least one boundary in this over, or the pressure would be too much",3
DC fans what do you think of Carey over Hetmyer?,2
NO. DONT EXPOSE STOIN TO RASHID PANTSS,3
Pant trying to play a young Dhoni innings here.,3
"DC are gonna play Rashid off, unless Rishab thinks the impossible.",3
Can Pant keep calm and respect Rashid here? This is the time you need to keep your wits about you.,4
I want SRH to win because they have Kanos. But Stoinis' biceps are testing my resolve,3
Warner holding Rashid back was a good idea,5
Just realized YJB always looks like he's wearing the orange cap,2
What time does the Super Over starts?,4
Rashid against stonis this will be fun.,2
DC's gotta be careful now and not do anything stupid,3
No wickets here is a win for DC even if over goes for 6,5
Man they hit 54 in the last 27 balls:(,2
Pant can't run two at all,4
"DC ain't winning this game.

Edit: you heard that first here boys.",1
starting to feel sorry for warner. 2020 has been a wild ride.,3
Rashid baby yes,3
Fuck yeah,4
"Yeeeessssss bitch , what a catch. It stuck",5
Jai Balayya,9
Fuck offf,3
nice.,2
Rashid Khan and Bhuvi carrying this bowling attack.,7
wow the way I yelled ‚Äúfuck‚Äù out loud just now,5
Rashid you beauty...,3
"Pant, what the fuck was that. Rashid's last over. Dumbass cricket. Idiot.",6
King khan,4
Pant and brain dead batting choices. Name a better duo,6
HOLYFUCK RASHID KHAN YOU ARE THE KING OF HYDERABAD,12
lol,1
Pant should really work on his composure. Can't rely on him at all,6
Dumbass,4
FUCK YES RASHID,3
Leg spinner to left handed batsman - good idea!,7
Hagg dia bhai ne,3
Lol Pant has swept like 90% of the balls he faced against Rashid,3
lmao meme Pant,1
"Because of the last 2 matches, this equation looked like an easy win for the batting team at first glance. Then realized it's over 12 an over.",6
Lol Panty making every Delhi fans pants wet rnüòÇüòÇ,1
Rashid's back fuckers!!,3
Lmao I love punters face.,1
fuck yes ..thank you being pant ..rishabh pant,2
Rashid my boiii.,1
Could have just played this over but no,1
"2018 vibes. Williamson carrying the batting, Rashid & Bhuvi carrying the bowling",14
Pant doesn't have 2 brain cells .,5
"I'm crying, thats a beautiful spell from Rashid üò≠",4
"no no no, i don't want hope.",4
Wow someone actually took an outfield catch,4
Good match,2
Pant is so fuckin predictable!,1
Great to see Riyan Parag get some action,2
All he had to do was play off this over. SRH's game to win now.,3
I can‚Äôt watch thisss,1
Rashid is back bay,2
Can't really blame Pant. Couldn't exactly play him out at this stage,3
Young Rashid Khan from Afghanistan!!,5
Pant is playing a Dhoni type innings of taking the game deep,2
The best 30 year old 20 year old in the world,10
Would be thrilled if there will be another super over today,1
This is still DC's game to lose üò∂,3
Slogging against Bhuvi & Rashid is always going to be risky,2
Pant out. Is there a twist in the tale again? Were the past couple of days just aberrations.,3
"Scratch that

Now Samson or Ishan > Pant",4
Don't get excited. Don't get excited.,4
You just can't keep falling over and score big runs everytime.,2
Ponting looked at the camera like it‚Äôs The Office.,12
Punter's expression ü§£,7
Should've played out Rashid when will pant learn sigh,6
Just Kidding Cement,0
Unnecessary my Panty,2
The squeal I let out at that,6
"Bairstow glad he plays in the same team as Rashid so that he can still use his trademark 'yes Rash, nice Rash'",9
Rashid is back!,4
"Game still not over tho. Stoinis' 170 odd vs NZ makes me think he could cut this close

Edit: 146*",5
That was good field placement than good ball tbf,3
Gg wp. Gn folks.,1
Ponting to Shreyas : what‚Äôs it gonna be tonight mate ? You want the knuckle duster or the fkin baseball bat?,6
Priyam Garg has a punchable face.,0
someone said earlier that Pant is struggling like Kedar Jadhav lmao i can see whyy,0
"Great bowling :(

Discount jadeja next up",3
That look on Ponting's face is so satisfying. Better than winning the match.,4
i think ive seen pant get out to that shot like 15 times in the last 1 year.,5
"What did the commentator just say? ""Riyan Parag took a ...""",8
I was just typing how this was still DC's match and Rash got him.,2
Punter looks ready to give pant am earful after match,6
"Rashid is worth every single penny of that 9 crore. Not just about the bowling. He looks like a fighter who will fight tooth and nail till the last ball.

And, good with the bat as well. Would have loved to have him in KKR.",7
"Ohh boyy, Smith vs Cummins tomorrow. Should be fun.",4
Send in Mishraji. He's the only one who can pull a Tewatia.,3
No other team anthem even comes close to the SRH..maybe the old Hyderabad anthem,3
When will these batsmen learn not to attack the opposing team‚Äôs best bowlers,3
Pant is a Ponzi scheme,5
Porno level acting by the MI boys in that Samsung ad,13
"Well this just got a lot more interesting, totally still doable for DC but SRH should win",2
Fuck yeah!!!!,1
This is why I hate Pant. I'm sure the fielder there was waiting for the catch. How many times has Pant been caught there?,6
"Pant sweeps like he's an Aussie .



He should settle their then üòÇüòûüòûüòûüò≠üò≠üò≠",-1
Pant is so talented but he's always jittery while batting. He needs to learn calmness... I'm happy though,8
"Good to see SRH's bowling coming together - Bhuvi, Rashid, Natarajan, Abhishek

Nol, not you K Khaheel",7
Pants has no game sense..why go after Rashid and lose wicket,7
"Pant: Rasode main kaun tha..

Rashid: Main thaaaaaa BC",5
"**16.4** Rashid Khan to Pant, OUT, oh Pant tries the impossible shot. Rashid has slowed this down and bowled full on middle and leg. He wants to go behind square with the sweep, but he doesn't have pace to work with. Ends up sweeping this to deep square leg **117-5**

RR Pant c Garg b Rashid Khan 32 (27b 2x4 2x6) SR: 118.51",5
All over for DC now,2
Rashid got Pant out at his real age.,10
We played into the hands of Rashid Khan and SRH. Should've seen what KKR did against Rashid. So Brainless man no idea what the think tank was strategising. This is fucking awful.,13
Wonder what Ponting thinks of Pant‚Äôs fitness,9
Is Axar good?,2
"God damn it Pant what the fuck was the point of that? You didn‚Äôt need to hit Rashid, should‚Äôve targeted the other bowler. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",7
axe patel,2
"Man, Looking our prime bowlers shine after two match is so satisfying.",8
"Rashid Khan took the wicket of Rishabh Pant, and they were playing Afghan Jalebi in the background. LOL.",14
Fuck Pant... replace this dude in the Indian team PLEASE.,-2
Stoinis imagine ball to be Zampa and bang it out of the ground,5
"Pant is pants

Rashid is a face you want to smash.

Rubbish chase by Delhi",1
"Rasped Mai Kaun tha guys?
Rashid!!üòÇ",0
Unnecessary shot. 6 runs of Rashid over would have left 42 off 3. Totally gettable. Zero match awareness from pant.,12
People had been conservative against Rashid so far in this IPL. They took risks today and he has picked 3 wickets. Outstanding stuff,15
Rashid proved his worth this match,8
"lol, Pant throwing his kit around.",6
As I have learnt in this ipl it ain‚Äôt over till the last ball.,9
"Favorite time, stoinis soaking up balls, one big shot and back in the shed",1
Great bowling!,2
Lol with the Afghan jalebi,7
"3 overs 44 is still easy af, given Nattu is inexperienced, Bhuvi is rusty and Khaleel is Khaleel.",10
"FYI , 50+% people said Delhi's batting was strongest where there are rabada ishant nortje in pace and Mishra Ashwin Sandeep in spin department",7
Unreal figures for Rashid to finish on,2
"LOL, to dub Sachin in that Mutual fund advts in Tamil, they found someone who speaks exactly like him",2
Big Dick Energy only possible rescue now,1
Bois what happened to basil thampi? Khaleel for Basil next match?,1
Even Warner's captaincy was great this game!,3
Half the comments compared to yesterday's match thread,2
Said at the beginning that Rashid has to be head and shoulders above the other spinners to justify his place in the squad. And that‚Äôs exactly what he did. Kudos to him.,8
Another reminder Delhi has lowest run rate in the powerplay.,3
Nail in those Yorkers Nattu,1
Wtf. I thought that JSW paints ad was a clothing ad,4
So many years and still nobody knows how to face Rashid Khan,9
44 of 3. Gonna be tough,7
Are they actually playing 3 peg at the stadium?,2
Send ishant ..he will chase this for dc in a second,3
C'mon nattu.,2
"Don't advise him to bowler slower balls, Bhuvi.",1
Rashid‚Äôs been so good I‚Äôm about to tell him Chowringhee stop kaunsi hai,1
Congratulations SRH,3
Lord Khaleel gonna bowl the last over?,2
If DC loses this it would setup the points table nicely,2
Pant tried to play a young Dhoni innings and failed. He's an imposter confirmed.,3
44 from 18? I still have a sick feeling in my stomach saying that dc could still win...,2
Top-class four overs from Rashid,3
I love that Nattu is confident enough to bowl Yorkers.,2
"This is the best Rashid's performance in IPL for me. He has taken 3 white ball batters wicket for Indian team. No foreigners. 




Shame on us",7
Time for the stoin show,1
I am sleeping this game is done now,2
Even the analysts in the dugout were replaying Pant's sweep shot prior to his wicket,4
can we hope sunrisers?,1
u r g e n c y,3
"After this match is over the gambling favorite will have lost 10 out of 11 matches this IPL. Someone's making money off this. Mumbai beating KKR is the only favorite to win.

Edit: Meant to say 11 out of 12.",5
Yeeeyy we are winning our first match. Kanos lucky charm. Bought Bhuvi and Rashid back to form.,6
"Looks like Nattu, Bhuvi, and Khaleel for last 3 in that order. Would want to give Khaleel 20+ to defend.",2
Why are they retaining Khaleel until the last 2 overs?,6
Nattu can be a very good death bowler with his yorker,6
Pant really wanted to become Tewatia. Feel sad for him that he couldn't emulate his idol.,7
"It's a big ground, fielding matters a lot here !!",4
Pant's Thicc these days,5
I wouldn't trust Khaleel to defend 30 in an over.,6
"c'mon Stoinis, flex those muscles now!",4
Pant is actually not thick but wide,7
"Pant keeps making similar mistakes , getting holed out with a poorly executed shot",4
Bowl Williamson you cowards,12
One of the top order batsman of DC should finish the game if they use so many bowls at the top.,8
We need to make a Thicc bois 11,-2
The fact that I still have some hope for Dc... now that‚Äôs some clown shit,2
"Rashid is completely worth his price

Attack him and risk losing wickets quick

Don't attack him but only get 6 per over . Complete win/win",6
Always knew this winning streak couldn't last forever....,2
Off topic. But Samson and KL should be our Keeper  choices. Pant needs to go back and play some domestic cricket. He's not ready.,3
Stoinis and Axar are shit (speaking from their experience during KXIP),1
Why is Srh on bottom?,0
"We got an Indian Fizz with us Boys. Groom him well please, SRH.",10
on now get out pliss,3
Ah the classic Rashid khan highlights during match. Missed them a lot.,3
Superb Nattu!,6
Congrats SRH,2
Good Yorker Natrajan. He is very accurate,2
No miracles today!!,1
NATRAJAN today is the day you prove that you are better than that slut Apsara,8
Natarajan's Yorkers have been spot on! Malingaesque,5
"Man this Nattu has bowled good yorkers. Not express pace, but accurate. üëåüëåüëå",3
I don‚Äôt want to jinx it but rarely do you see a bowler execute so many consecutive yorkers,10
How this guy sat out last season is a mystery to me.,8
Just pretend he's Chris Jordan stoinoo,5
Axar is the biggest imposter,5
Bhai kitne Yorker phekega,3
Damn this guy is good with yorkers,6
Normal service resumes for srh bowling and dc batting ..,4
DC should SOS for Tewatia now.,2
DC captain really needs to do something himself. Struggles against quality pace and takes a lot of time against spin to get going,3
This is the kind of bowing you expect from srh,3
How many more times will Rishabh Pant play a loose shot during a crunch situation? This has become so repetitive.,3
Truly a NATARAJA ...,1
Yorkers come too easy from him,3
Just make 40 instead of 41. I believe Rabada will defend anything,4
there's a khaleel over left tho :'),2
Natarajan is the reincarnation of 2016 FizzüòÆ,8
And khaleel plays for India‚Äôs t20 team and not Natarajan,5
Nattu with those nut yorkers.,10
Peak Bhuvi was insane. Used to swing the ball more than Chahar at the start yet would nail Yorkers at the death.,8
"Fuck, Natrajan has nailed them yorkers!",10
"This is top notch stuff, hope khaleel learns",8
Natarajan you beauty. You earned my respect.,9
Natarajan executing the Yorker to perfection.,11
Goddamn. Did Nattu bowl 20 yorkers in a row?,9
"How Axar made into indian national team, that too in world cup as well is beyond me.",7
"I guess this ""be mature, see the situation, and then hit the bad balls to see us till the end"" kind of approach is not suiting Pant.

He is a basher. The Indian team management has tried to make him a mature finisher for a long time now. But, looks like it is having the opposite effect.

His natural flair is getting lost.",6
"High praise from Bishop, we'll done Natarajan. Keep doing it.",9
Nattu over Khaleel anyday.,4
Very impressive from Natarajan anna,4
This Natarajan guy has a very Sohail Tanveer feel,3
They need a big hit in this over or else the game is gone,0
These yorkers are so good wtf,7
What a bowler...just a good couple more,3
Nattu > Malinga confirmed.,2
Finally I can experience my usual emotion of being numb ... missed it so far in this tournament.,7
Excellent classic SRH bowling delivering a win tonight,6
getting early Bumrah vibes from Natarajan,7
Natarajan is nailing those yorkers time and again. Nice bowling.,7
Insanely consistent Yorkers.,7
"If despite seeing them struggle against Yorkers, Bhuvi still bowls the slower one, then Imma head out.",2
Wow this is brilliant bowling,4
Natarajan mannnn,5
DC will have hope as long as Khaleel still has to bowl,7
If Pant was Dhoni he would have focussed on staying not-out until that juicy Khaleel over,9
Tie it cowards,3
Delhi could chase 20-25 in the final over against Khaleel tho. Stoinis' wicket is crucial,6
Who's this bloke bowling yorkers at will,4
Natarajan man,1
Class bowling from Nattu,1
MATCH OVER,1
In I guess,3
Best Tamil fast bowler since Lakshmipathy?,2
"Yorker king this IPL after 11 matches



1. Natarajan


2. Rabada


3. Saini


4. Bumrah


5. Archer",12
"That's gone


E - Not",1
Yorker feast,2
"Players like Natarajan,Chakravarth came up due to TNPL. North Indian states should also  come up with their tournaments",5
This is where Delhi struggles compared to MI. Pollard and one of the Pandya brothers would be out for Mumbai right now and the game would look very different.,4
Lmao the AI crowd went berserk at that axar tonk down the ground,4
Dhadkhan bhadne lagegi ab.,3
Gotta throw better Fabian cmon. That would've been out,6
We will bowl first thank you.,6
Natarajan pakki pencil,5
So they‚Äôre going after khaleel?,4
No full tosses Nattu,3
I think Stoinis is in.,1
This kinda tension cannot be good for my 130 year old heart,3
Nataranjan lowkey bowling accurately and with discipline.,9
"Play for NRR, DC",2
Lmao umpires these days are big pussies won't even give the most obvious ones not out on the field,4
Why do those LED banners exist and why are they so useless and shitty?,1
Throw could be better,1
This kind of bowling by Natarajan is even Sharjah-proof,11
"DEW DEW DEW, abey batting bhi karni padhti hai chase karne ke liye",5
Now can I troll Pant fans ?,5
"Damn, if only thorw was fast enough. Smh",2
Such good is the yorker strategy that a delivery gone wrong can sometimes be missed by the batsman,6
Hoping for khaleel,2
Amazing how fast they‚Äôre making most of these referral decisions,6
Oh damn!,5
Use those muscles Stoin ffs,1
well bois. Game over here,1
Is this the left armer that was promised for India.,8
"SEXY BOWLING THIS, NATARAJAN!",5
That's plumb,1
NATARAJAN YOU BEAUTY,7
Nattu you beauty!! Yorker bully,6
HE FUCKING DESERVES THAT WICKET,8
Come on,3
Hats off nats,5
Natarajan you beauty,6
By God! Natarajan has been exceptional today,9
"That's out baby, Natrajan Yorkers finally got a wicket.",12
Ponting writing down who is the imposter,10
THAT SPELL DESERVED A FUCKING WICKET!  Either way a dot ball to end.,5
That fist bump was smooth,0
Natarajan awesome,1
NATTUUUUU making me nut,3
"Delhi fans, what the h√®ll is happening?",0
Fml... good job to natty,1
Natarajan doing what international bowlers are failing to do,7
Game over,0
BEAUTIFUL! Simply beautiful.,3
He needed that wicket for his excellent bowling spell.,8
Looked out in real time,0
"My god you beauty ... 

What an over ..take a bow!!!",2
Stoinis is literally brawns over brain... Makes me glad I have some grey matter rather than none,-2
Well bowled Nattu,2
That's the filthiest Yorkers I've seen in years. And it's not out most probably.,13
amazing bowling from natarajan,8
He absolutely earned that wicket.,8
Beauty Nattu!,5
yorker bot,10
WHAT A BALL.,7
The new Yorker King in town,8
Why review that?,4
"Finally, a well deserved wicket.",6
"Fuck, whattaa yorka. My calm self can't even now.",4
Natarajan hit all the lengths Udana was supposed to yesterday.,7
Iyer needs to take the blame for this pathetic batting display..,3
"Damn Natarajan!

That's around 42% Yorkers in 4 overs. Great skill. 5 stars indeed. Won the match for SRH for sure",10
"Natarajan showing if Bhuvi can‚Äôt bowl the yorkers, he can do it for the team.",7
"If you can bowl yorkers consistently, there is not much the batsman can do. Brilliant bowling.",6
Nutty!!!,3
Bowled a perfect over and finished with a wicket. Take a bow natarajan,10
Natarajan is the pencil,11
LETS GO BABY,6
Deserves a wicket bowled very sharp,7
Natarajan has been a revelation,12
That was so good,6
Even if this is not out ...phenomenal bowling,11
So juvenile reviewing these decisions. Penalize this nonsense,2
"Fuck off, how can you bowl 24 balls yorker.",26
Delhi need to relook at the top 3 batsman again. They just can't win the game with horrible run rate at the top. There do not finish the game either and leave way too many run for the lower order.,2
"That's plumb mate, OUT
 
Tata, bye bye, good bye. Gaya",6
Rahane should replace Dhawan,-1
"So good to see Natty nailing all those yorker length deliveries.

It was his main USP years ago when he was sold for exhorbitant amount.",9
Looks like missing off..,3
"Holy shit that was a great over from Natarajan, missed just one yorker.",9
Well?,3
Guys who is that girl?,7
"Natarajan, Samad and Williamson bringing the spice to the Biryani!",11
Folks we got new yorker baba after Malinga. Meet Nattu.,8
who's that kid supporting SRH?,4
"Sometimes i miss umpires like taufel , he wont have referred such easy ones to third umpires and have continue the game..
Modern day umpires play safe , even if they are in good position to see and take decisions on runouts.",1
reverse stoinks,5
Nattu being an absolute cheat code atm,15
Who‚Äôs that chick?,8
sexyxyxyxyxy,8
"Nattu ne kiya khattu, le liya stoinis ka wickettu



Sorry",5
The virgin team getting laid today,22
Nice bowling.,6
What‚Äôs taking so long lmao,7
I love this Natarajan. Finally a bowler bowling yorkers consistently. Killed the game with that over!,24
Pant doing just pant things. He needs to start finishing the games.,7
Third umpire stalling to fuck with us lol,7
Anddddddd we are back baby. Let the memes begin,8
Aww Cute SRH supporter ‚ù§Ô∏è,-1
SRH today,2
Yay! First win coming up.,3
Dicks out for Ajinkya,5
 Welcome to dilli,3
Great we're fucked now,5
Give me an all out boys.,2
I cannot believe for as long as stoinis has been out there he‚Äôs leaving with 11(8),3
This guy deserves it !! Never seen Brett Lee praise another bowler like this before,10
Nattu you beauty.,8
DC kit is clean,7
wickets is a hitting ..,6
Not a joke but we need to start playing for NRR now. This game is gone. The pitch is hard to bat on. Bhuvi has an over left. I would kill someone if we missed the playoffs on NRR. We have too good a team after years,4
"**17.6** Natarajan to Stoinis, OUT,  **126-6**

MP Stoinis lbw b Natarajan 11 (9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 122.22",3
"Khaleel, happy meal will win it for the double D's",3
Baby I'm your CVV you're my OTP üò£üò£,5
hahahaha,2
"Bhuvi 2 wickets :) 

Seen after looo0000ng time",6
Kagiso Natrajan,10
"Good to see Natrajan bowl like a champ. Hope this knocks out that fraud Khaleel out of the SRH lineup and eventually national team. If they specifically want a left armer, get this yorker bowling guy instead of that dumbo who thinks bowling wide bouncers at 135kmph is going to scare anyone.",7
Just need to add some little pace & he's a monster,7
Nattu has been so much better than Khaleel. If we need a left armer we should try him in some match.,6
Nattu absolutely deserved that wicket.,8
Bowl bhuvi and finish the game plss,0
"Today marks the end of  epic serial run chases of this IPL. Hopefully, we will get another one soon. Good night folks.",2
So this is why SRH has been persistent with Natarajan,3
"Tharki cameramen have no hot chicks to show from the crowd, no cheerleaders, so they‚Äôre now showing random female staff members lmao",13
Pant hasn‚Äôt learned one bit since his debut in Indian team. He has only grown in physical terms. /s,3
After sundar today nattu something to cheer for chennai or tamilnadu supporters.,7
"I blame Hetmyer more than Pant. That Rashid ball was super tempting and should've been a six. Mishit, yes. 
But Hetmyer was just forcing a good ball to the boundary. You had the momentum why do that?",2
"If DC loses, the table will get very even. This is so interesting. First you think bowling second will win the game, then you think bowling first. Each game is a story of its own. It feels like they should always have it in UAE lol..",5
Man if axar somehow pulls it off I'm done with 2020,3
Natty deserved the wicket.,2
Axar redemption arc?,2
BALL-TRIARCHY FTW.,3
"Lol, I just checked my last comment. I called Priyam Garg- Riyan Parag. Funny part is that nobody noticed and upvoted it",2
Kapil Dev: Nervous toh nahi keh sakte par Dilli ki gaand zaroor phatti hui hai,9
SRH 2018 loading complete,7
Pant is such a 1 D batsman I need my 1 D glasses to watch him bat...,3
Natarajan that was fkn sexy,10
I guess punter didnt put any springs in the team's bats today ..,8
This guy Natrajan is a far superior bowler than Khaleel. People should hype him more. He is also a left armer which the Indian team lacks.,18
Now i understand how TN reached final in both limited over comp,6
Natarajan come to RCB,1
I don't think even peak Bumrah bowled that many yorkers in a match,7
After two tarific games this was a snooze fest.,3
"After all the hardwork rabada did,how you gon disrespect my man like that",3
Last csk match k baad chennai se delhi pe aaya tha bc,4
SRH fans are rejoicing not knowing Mishra ji is gonna fuck them up,8
Sunrisers getting their first win and DC their first loss this year,2
Good nut for Nattu,2
Who‚Äôs the PA guy making the announcements for?,2
How long will teams keep choosing to bowl and keep fucking themselves,2
Over of the game by Nataranjan. Accurate yorkers and just took the wind out of Delhi's chase with that over.,7
What do we reckon has been happening with dew then? Teams have persisted with choosing to chase despite most of the results so far suggesting it's the tougher option,2
Nattu has inspired Boobie to search for his own Yorkers. Mad game this!,5
Natrajan's toe crusher's making the batsman do the cosmic dance.,3
CSK to the bottom of the table tonight,6
u/RLKay did Bhuvi just bowl a Yorker!?,1
"I missed Sanju Manju during the previous over. He always had a dislike for yorkers. someone bowled a full toss and sanju was like ""see? he was trying to bowl a yorker!""",5
Jasprit Natarajan,9
Joffra needed,5
"Guys we could see mishraji pulling a tewatia here :""v",3
"I hope DC gives Rahane a chance next match atleast...he's a confidence player, if assured of a place in the team for few matches he will definitely come good",2
Where all the fuckers who asked Risabh to play sensibly at? Where you at?,1
Fuck DC and their 500 left handers,11
That was really well timed,0
This is the srh that we know and love,5
Rabada: Fuck it I will do it myself,3
Rabada and Axar would've chased this down in Cricket 19,2
WHO THE BOWLER??!?!?,2
Just wait and watch Axar do what he does best - nothing!,2
"*Bhuvi baby, watchu doing?*",3
"Khaleel Out, Sandeep in for next fixture. Sandeep looked pretty good in the first match and bowled some Yorkers too.",5
Glad to see there is at least one team that knows how to bowl at the death.,6
[deleted],3
This is peak 2016-2018 SRH death bowling (so far),11
Who's coming out next?,0
"Gg go next, fix your batting line delhi",0
Pant did a *Thala Dhoni* today....,4
So guys Khaleel has one over left,2
Finally it feels like the good ol SRH bowling,10
Perhaps next time the toss winning captain won't bat second on an used wicket,5
SRH win will move CSK to the bottom of the table,3
"Wrap Rabada and give him 100 cr lump sum for next 10 years to stay @dc. 
Cc: parthjindal",3
Good bowling gives me harder hard on than Good batting,7
KG needs to do a jofra here,1
u/Plugfix27 now he did.,2
I remember when Axar was called an all rounder,1
Rabada doing an archer,1
so I‚Äôll see you at the CSK-MI final guys,7
Boobie!!!,2
30 runs in the next over ?,2
"Axar for once in your life, I implore you to play an innings that actually proves the tag of ""all rounder"" you carry around ffs",5
danny morrison pronounces it RRRRabada,1
"Even if we win this ..srh have a lesson to learn ...cant always handle the pressure of defending low to average scores ..please join the tewatia club and sometimes give us fans 180 to 200 +  


We dont mind watching csk type non exciting matches ..",3
Bring on Tewatia mode,0
"Will be happy with an SRH win just to balance things out a bit in the points table.

One team continuously losing and one continuously winning can make things a bit boring. Let the play off spots stay up for grabs till the last match!!",6
"Overall this team looks good. Still not fully sold on Abhishek as the 5th bowler. Shankar should replace Garg when he‚Äôs fit. Simply because he can bowl. Pollard, Stoinis and Dube have bowled well so Shankar should also be able to.",3
Natarajan built his reputation bowling yorkers in TNPL. He also had to remodel his action after he was accused of chucking. So happy to see him perform in a big stage like this.,26
Good to see bhuvi back in form,4
Both of India's premier death bowlers getting hit in consecutive days while youngsters like Saini and Natarajan are making a name for themselves. I don't know how to feel about this.,5
[deleted],9
Nutted for Nattu,7
why the fuck do they have so many lefthanders.,3
Bhuvi please.,2
lmao if rabada wins the game from here...,0
A six every second ball,0
Tewatia scored that in a single over,2
What you doing Bhuvi!,2
Love how the bowlers always swing their bats and the batters block in losing chases.,4
"Such a poorly constructed DC chase. Nobody took any responsibilty or provided any impoetus to the innings. No idea why the in form Stoinis comes in soo late either. 

That being said great bowling from SRH and, and the batting line up looks ridculously more stable with Kanos in.",8
I'm worried about CSK now. Will they be able to beat SRH now,5
A 4 off the first ball nice,3
Say 25 need off the last over. Khaleel to bowl. Advantage DC.,1
Damn bro Csk bout to go last :(,7
Excellent almost-yorker by Bhuvi.,2
One of the side effects of quarantine rules for the Australian tour means a 20-25 squad which means Bhuvi and the likes of Saini being certain selections.,2
Needed ashwin 6-6 masterclass today,3
CSK will go bottom after this SRH win,5
When Rabada is playing better than Delhi's top order.,5
Khaleel is to bowl the last so DC still got a chance,7
I don't trust khaleel with 20 runs tbh. We need to save as many runs as possible in this over.,4
"Rabada gonna get yorked, what goes around comes around",4
Our batting isn't up to the mark. There's no way we're winning the IPL with this batting lineup.,4
"Our deep fielding between Warner, Pandey and Rashid is intense",11
The only hint of a spark left in this match is that Khaleel is bowling the last over.,14
what was that shot lmao,2
STOP BOWLING YORKERS! WE ARE ALREADY DEAD,35
honestly this is easy they just need to hit at least a 4 on every ball no big deal,2
Khaleel is the impostor in the SRH bowling unit,20
That Bairstow knock not looking that bad in retrospect.,9
"Boobie, don't go back to slower balls please. I love this version of you.",10
I love that franchise cricket is about different state players for different teams. But CSK has missed out on a couple of gems like Washington Sundar and Natarajan.,12
Bayliss needs to do some sit-ups,1
[removed],3
Reduce the Quantum of Loss^^TM,4
Finally good to see Bhuvi pull off the yorkers.,7
Very good death bowling,3
What the f**k happened to kane mama :(,1
We are going to last place csk boiis,5
Yorkers needs nerfing.,3
"even lord Umesh can defend this  
right????",7
Scenes when(If) Khaleel bottles this.,6
All teams look closely matched this year. Will be very unpredictable,2
Williamson doesn‚Äôt have an actual injury right? He will be back next game?,3
Even Khaleel can‚Äôt fuck it up from here...can he?,5
Love that Pulsaar ad!,1
2017/18 SRH enters the chat.,5
Can I feel safe with Lord Khaleel bowling last over?,3
Nattu would actually do so well bowling at Sharjah,3
Dc must wait until there are three balls left and hit three sixes,2
"We have seen so many improbable chases done recently, this one feels like batsmen missed out!!

Pant has to get his sweep in order. Dude has been caught there hundreds times now!",3
"Pandey, how could you",3
Please don't fuck it up now khaleel,2
"Bhuvi, Natarajan, Rashid combined 12 overs 64 runs 6 wickets.",8
Poor Khaleel,3
28 off 6. This is beyond Khaleel.,2
Having kane in the team has made all the difference,4
WHere Tewatia at?,1
Was not expecting a drop from manish,3
Pandey memeing for khaleel lmaoo,3
Specialist fielder with non specialist drop..,3
28 off the last over. Shit,1
Got lucky. It was right in the slot.,1
"Don't give it away easily, play for NRR",2
Manish dropping a catch. Now that's something you don't see everyday,10
"Ahhh fuck dropped, pandey BC. Why taking things lightly. That's elementary",2
"Omg Manish, you are the specialist fielder",2
SRH have won this with disciplined bowling. DC will be disappointed with their batting.,3
Am I the only one nervous about this given khaleel?,5
Drinking game: Take a shot every time Kaleel sticks his tongue out after a delivery,4
The return of Bhuvi and Rashid is a gigantic positive. Go Hyderabad!,3
So axar is an all rounder and rabada is a bowler just saying,1
ManPan wyd,1
Manish Pandey forgot what he does best then dies he even do anything well?,2
Just dropped the game there mate.,1
Tactical drop to keep mishraji from upper cutting khaleel for 24 off the next 4,2
NO MANISH YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE,5
Wow Pandey dropped one??,2
Pandey dropping is so 2020,3
these fuckin yorkers... too good,2
Bairstow knock was pretty good actually.,4
I swear to god Khaleel if we loose this,4
Specialist fielder my ass,2
What the fuck is happening in UAE even Pandey is dropping dollies,10
*SUPEROVER INCOMING*,3
Rabada should have test century for sure. Good strike that,4
4 sixes for superover!! Let's go baby.,5
"Shouldn't leave catches pandey Garu,we can't afford those",6
Pandey ji playing 4D chess to so Khaleel is dropped in next match?,6
Lord khaleel came so close to get a wicket,3
First time watching Manish Pandey miss a catch.,4
5D chess from Manish to get Khaleel dropped for the next match.,5
Nah don‚Äôt catch that. Khaleel doesn‚Äôt deserve a wicket for his shitstorm.,9
"Khaleel to do a thala - he'll enter his final form when RRR is above 36 and swing it like Anderson


Edit - just took a wicket when Rrr went above 36",10
Finally a not so close match,2
How are CSK top of the fair play award lmao,20
Pandey dropping a catch is really really rare!! But expect better from him!,8
Yeah we lost but seeing CSK at #8 is fucking hilarious,14
Khaleel Anna wicket teesindu ro,29
Al-khaleel üëçüëçüëç,5
Why is Kane off the field? Hope he's ok,3
"Bowld him, he deserves that wicket.",5
HOLY FYCK,3
"Hyderabad fans, I ask one thing, WHY?",4
CLEAN,2
Beauty,3
Old SRH is backkkk!,3
what tf is khaleel even supposed to do?!,1
Top of the fair play table bois! The only one that matters,4
Discount Santner out,3
One impostet taking another imposter's wicket,3
Axar overrated batsman,3
Khaleel looks a bit like yash from Kgf,7
Khaleeeeeel I never doubted you,9
Rabada more of an all rounder than Axar,4
woah..manish drops? no worries ...i get mine,1
Shit gets wicket. I‚Äôm not talking about ball. Just khaleel.,-1
God I love it when someone is bowled out by a pacer.,1
"What you witnessed today, Ladies and Gentlemen, was the classic SRH strangle job from the Golden days of 2018. First of many to come hopefully.",12
Khaleelsi my qween,7
That Sound üòÑüòÑüòÑ,3
"Kane back in the team with style

Bowling looks good again

What happiness is this?",9
Drop percentage in this IPL is more than 30 or 40%,3
"Its okay, better lose like this than on a big match, buckle up boys",1
Fair play awards is a fuckin scam,9
The Great Khalee,3
MOTM to Kane ?,3
Mishra will pull a tewatiya,1
How many fair play points per match?,3
Williamson showed this match that big hits are not needed to score at a great strike rate.,4
Vintage SRH,3
Khaleel with a sober celebration? Someone definitely gave him an earful.,8
"Bois I think this is a Set Squad, I'd take out Grag for another bowling option like Sandeep or Basil thampi.",2
How did DC manage to fuck this up?,1
Should've been on a hat-trick chance . Khaleel to Warner,1
GET IN KHALEEL,1
"So here is the ad girl from dream11 adv with Bumrah


Insta link :- https://instagram.com/pallavibatraofficial?igshid=sg9u1zc6rhym",1
Manish bb wat is u doing,1
Do we need to fight with umpire to be on top of the fair play table? Never understood the criteria,5
"We surely weren't winning it with 2 saffas out there, even if we needed 2 off 6",5
"Delhi lost the game due to Iyer‚Äôs captaincy. 

He uses Rabada for containment, Warner uses Rashid for taking wickets.",3
"'Now this is death bowling'

Anakin Skywalker",5
Good to see bowling team not choking,3
Zoom it in more at ponting's face please.,7
"Death, Taxes and SRH defending low totals",8
Teams winning the toss have only won 2 out of 11 matches so far (including this one),1
I still cannot believe it. Bug probably,2
Announcer fucked up the pronunciation of Nortje there,1
Cowards. Send in Mishra.,3
This was such a good team performance from SRH,6
Did bairstow have a bit of a dodgy innings?,1
"All the superstar youngster batsmen seem to completely fall apart on pitches that have something in it for the bowlers, what a shame",2
"**19.3** Ahmed to Patel, OUT, timber. Rabada sees one on a length, and slogs across its line, only managing an inside edge onto the stumps **138-7**

AR Patel  b Ahmed 5 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33",2
See how good SRH can be with 4 batsmen instead of 3,21
Rabada needs to do a Cummins here,1
"This is real cricket man, that bat v bat shit gets boring after 2 games.",9
Seems like teams have to pray they lose the toss this year.,3
"Apart from those couple of drops, SRH was really disciplined overall",6
"Ah yes, death specialist duo from delhi guys",8
This IPL is so competitive wtf. Making me even more nervous,8
Nokia's here!,2
Nortje is striking at 300,7
DC prepared for boobie and Rashid but Nattu was out of syllabus,5
We are paying manish for the only job and he fail at it,3
[removed],7
the sound of those stumps was SO fkn sexy,7
SRH back to old days.,8
"MOTM is SRH bowlers, I won't accept batriachy today",16
God damn it... dc come on guys . We always make things so difficult for ourselves,1
amazing comeback from srh.,3
Wtf Delhi and SRH has done to be at the end of the fair play award?,6
Iyer really need to define his batting role,5
Good bowling but that Kane innings was clutch,8
How do they award fair play points?,9
Amit Mishra is my spirit animal.,3
Need NGIDi,4
The SRH we know and deserve- ladies and gentlemen.,15
Nokia is the 3 hitting specialist,11
"*Ek hi dil hai Samad Bhai, Kitne baar jeetoge!?*",9
Rabada is 10x the batsman Axar is.,11
I know that what happened the previous two nights were something special and can‚Äôt be replicated but this seems a little one-sided and kills the hype that was built up,2
Nattu is Goodu,3
"This is SRH luxury they still have Thampi, Sandeep & Kaul on the bench & all three seasons they have played different bowlers",5
"Can we all observe a moment of silence for CSK? Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.",16
No Tewatia redemption arc for Axar I see,8
Ponting is like what happened? We had this.,10
Khaleel is our Umesh,10
"I like DC, but I also enjoy watching Ponting's side lose",7
"Good effort in the deepm we are gonna face CSK, it's like our kryptonite",7
Rashid Khan Player of the Match.,7
Khaleel finished with the most Khaleel way possible.,38
I still love you Rabada,6
Commentators were writing off SRH before the match as if they were amateurs...,11
rabada playing proper cricketing shots. Good to see that,8
Moral victory for Rabada,10
1 ball 22 runs now seems like srh too it home. Shows how deceiving t20 stats can be,8
Best batsman and best bowler of DC is Rabada.,8
The absolute glee on Warner's face is infectious.,5
"Bit of a classic ‚Äòwatch both teams bat‚Äô pitch. Kane aside, nobody‚Äôs been able to accelerate and that bairstow knock looks like a great platform to allow Kane to go a bit",10
Rabada is a top order batsman in an alternate universe,7
Rashid should get the MoM,6
Rabada a clean striker,4
"Welp, that was a pretty uninteresting match.",2
Much needed dead rubber after the last 2 nights,4
Rabada the best bowler and best batsman,11
Rabada goes out in style,8
Happy that we are back into business.. cya tomorrow guys,5
let kanos have a bowl next match,6
That is why Delhi never wins the IPL. They had no right to lose to SRH with that team!,3
"First points, are qualified for the semifinals?  /s",6
When is the next match at Sharjah?,4
"All teams have 10 Fairplay points a game, but CSK have 10.7...  #KheloDimaagSe",14
Rabada pulls a Msd,12
Lol no fake cheer for that last delivery,8
DONT CHANGE THE TEAM NOW ! THIS IS PERFECT PLAYING 11,9
Mark my words when India tour England or Australia this is exactly what will happen. All these people scoring in the ipl will be sitting ducks to swing bowling and it'll be upto batsman like kohli and pujara to try and pull the game in indias favour. I predict 50/2 In almost any match,5
captain cardoon,5
How can you think of winning this game when your  best batsmen amit mishra still in dugout,11
"*Ek hi gaali hai Khaleel bhai, kitni baar sunoge*",10
"Good luck shreyas, Pant and other DC Bois answering Pointing.  Axar better claim his credits lmao",5
Rabada said I Am Going To Leave,3
"So Kanos was who we needed to add to win matches?

Always has been.",27
"Awesome performance by SRH. This is the SRH I missed. Win or lose, but give a fight. GG Delhi.",23
Should've sent rabada ahead of axar,4
Khaleel Ahmed is Lord Siraj regen,3
CSK bottom of the table lads,15
You need tough players to play on tough pitches. Kanos take a bow!!,15
[Did not call it..........again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j1xyyh/match_thread_11th_match_delhi_capitals_v/g730ie7/),2
"He's economical but Axar has to be the worst number 7 of this IPL. So fuxking useless.

Delhi can't rely on Stoinis at 6. He might come off but not a pollard, russell type finisher. So as soon as Pant gets out it's curtains for us.

Carey has to bat at 7.  Only 4 bowlers are enough. Stoinis should somehow bowl 4. We need to bat deep and chase these kind of moderate totals ffs.",7
SRH winning this can be either of two things- a statistic or a comeback! Let‚Äôs goooooooo!,6
These fair play points are total scam. They csk on top some how.,13
"Can't wait to hear gavaskar say ""Nokia ne no Kia"" after Nortje refuses a single",8
"Very cool Rabada, MS approves",4
hopefully RR can retain their position on the table... they fucking better,4
Finally a good entertaining game from the bois in orange.,10
Do we call this a clinical win?,4
"Okay enough experimentation.

Stoinis as opener please and drop Shaw.

Top 3 should be

Stoinis 
Dhawan
Rahane",-5
Rabada aur mishi bhai op baki sab gandu hai dc main.,9
Nortje loves his 3s,3
Can anyone explain why pitches will get slower as the tournament goes on ?,3
Look who‚Äôs at the bottom of the table.,8
"Warner, Bairstow, Williamson all played incredibly considering this pitch

Williamson specifically, take a bow legend",13
You just saw the power of Reverse Jinx‚Ñ¢. Never doubt.,5
If every team is going to play so unpredictably we are here for very competitive IPL this year.,3
Warney really said üò∏ at the end there,5
Do we have a replacement for Khaleel? Probably the weakest link in our otherwise weak line-up.,3
"SRH still has a problem with their line up. With only 5 bowlers, if one of them has a bad day, it'll be become really difficult.",7
Next up KKR in Sharjah.... That will be interesting.,6
Waiting for ponting speech now,9
Who is gonna watch US presidential debate,7
Rashid seems to gel with almost most of the Indian players.,22
MOTM bhuvi or bairstow,2
Watching csk at the bottom of the table is depressing :(,1
"I think SRH have found their ideal lineup. Abdul Samad is very promising, and Kane was typical Kanos. I think on spin friendly pitches, they should experiment with Shahbaz Nadeem > Kaleel and Shankar in over Garg to bring up some more pace if things go south. Very happy with this performance, pitch was definitely hard to bat on, really got 2018 vibes from this game",21
Normalcy returns after 2 absolutely mad days of cricket.,17
Nortje 6*(3) in this IPL so far. Wasted down the order.,13
"Good knock from Williamson, if not for him SRH would have been in same position as last match..

This is the difference a solid no 4 can bring to the table",25
"Hate how they were just like jogging for singles towards the end, like at least try and recover the NRR a bit guys... SRH running between the wickets was really the difference between the sides.",11
Fist bumps after the game is such a revelation. Shaking hands with every player was painful.,14
"If Iyer and Dhawan had maintained same strike rate as Pant, DC would‚Äôve won. Don‚Äôt blame Pant",19
"MI, KKR, SRH and CSK bottom 4. LOL.",27
Kane and Rashid made difference today,25
i wOuLD LikE TO brEAK tHe REcoRD oF WiNNing aLL MAtcheS IN tHE IPL,10
Nattu's death bowling is lethal,26
"Kano not a strong man apparently , could have fooled me",21
The Nattu was so good today,16
2016 vibes bois. Loses the first 2 matches and wins the third. You know what it means.. You know what it means..,30
Rahane submitting his job application to Warner out there,16
"Tough pitch to bat on, Kane did an amazing job",27
Alright somebody tell me how pant fared. Was he as bad as the scoreboard suggests? I didn't watch,4
srh coming back to form right in time for mi games :'),23
Williamson completes SRH. This feels like an actual team now,32
"Just curious, is Rahane ever going to get a game this IPL?",9
Why do people want Shaw in the team. He is so inconsistent and drops a catch every match.,11
DC can be a killer team if they bring Carey in place of Hetmeyr,11
Is the loan option still on this IPL. Would love to have rahane in SRH,11
Unpopular opinion. Like it or not but Khaleel is 3rd best fast bowler in SRH line up. All other medium Pacers are sorted out by other teams. Unless they decide to play Nadeem I guess he'll stay,12
"Atleast we didn't lose by many, NRR is still good",3
The pitch was really difficult to bat today,4
Ggwp Bois! 2016 vibes are back.,17
Well done Hyderabad! Looking forward to more such awesome matches. Now good night lads!,14
Wow this IPL is going to be fun  and close like last year.,8
Waifu of the match: Kane Williamson.,30
This pitch does separate the boys from men. Kane showed how to do it.,35
"Alright now, customary shots of players from opposite sides having casual conversations while maintaining social distance",7
DC is such a braindead team. Where do I even start lol,2
"Considering how every batsman struggled to play on this pitch, Williamson made it look easy and effortless.Class is permanent.",61
Hopefully Rashid for MoM over Kane,4
"Kane, Rashid, Warner, bhuvi all in form, this is a quite literal dream",37
Good to see that Rashid is back to getting wickets. There was a chance he would be found out like Narine was a few years ago bu this bodes  well for SRH and Afg,12
CSK is at the bottom now...,8
Afraid of these kinda better cricket producing pitches they included the backyard of a ground  in sharjah.,9
Chennai Bois. How it feels to be last in the table ?,18
KKR > SRH > DD we are back boys !,-1
What percentage of Rishabh Pant's dismissals would be caught playing slog sweep?,7
"Delhi needs Stoinis at the top and then everything fixes itself.

He needs time to settle and explode. That 1st match did us more harm than good in the long run :(.",10
Rashid back in form is great. It's always exciting watching him bowl.,8
"First time ever, during any IPL, that CSK are at #8.   2020, ladies and gentlemen",20
What value does Axar Patel add? Just use mishi and Ashwin.,4
That is why players like Rahane are required in the playing XI,9
"srh middle order is still a bit untested. garg, samad and rashid need more batting time to be sure.",13
"No Kane, No Gain.....hence proved!",21
Pant is so Brainless man. He could've waited for 3 more balls and Bhuvi was there for the taking.,-5
"Kane Williamson proved yet again why ""Class"" is permanent.",31
At this moment best keeper batsmen in India in T20's and LO should be 1)Sanju Samson 2) Ishan Kishan 3)Rishab Pant.,6
"Need to finish 1 or 2 to win the IPL. DC need to be winning such matches really. Only Rashid to contend with, just play him out and hit others. It‚Äôs just stupid.",-1
Rahane in place of Axar,1
How is YJB the gamechanger! The awards still make no sense.,5
"If Priyam Garg starts batting as well we know he can, this playing 11 might be mostly perfect.",13
"Warner-Bairstow got a partnership
Kanos is back and scored a great knock
Bhuvi provided the start in the powerplay
Rashid being Rashid
And great find in Natarajan.

We're back boys
And it's my Birthday.",50
"We need to have Rahane instead of Prithvi or Hetmyer. Replacing Hetmyer would balance our middle order. Right now we are too much fire power on 4,5&6. Maybe hetmyer should open?",10
"SRH‚Äôs bowling won the game for them. Post a decent score and bowl to your strength seems the way to go this IPL. A very disciplined bowling display, from both the sides actually.",20
"Lol, no one to give out the awards?

Is this how it is this IPL",2
"To people thinking DC is playing well

First match: KXIP really bottled that one.
Second match: CSK did not even try.
Third match: lost to bowling with only one weapon.

Seriously need to be looking at batting in particular.",13
Must be nice to get an award for 27 runs,16
Somehow it's difficult to understand Priyam Garg's role. He seems to be a top order batsmen but obviously there are others. Chances of him being dropped for Shankar are high in next matches.,17
Never watched a post match IPL award ceremony. How many awards are there?!,13
"So many hit or miss players in Delhi. Shaw, Pant, Hetmyer and to an extent Dhawan. We need some cool heads. Rahane at the top and Carey at the death would help.",10
Fuck the batriarchy,24
Warner really understated KW there. Rift‚Ñ¢?,16
SRHüî•üî•üî•,19
Natarajan was on the money with his yorkers. That's how you bowl at the death.,30
Is Warner growing a moustache to increase his chances in acting in a Telugu movie?,55
No awards for Kanos.,22
"We are back boys. 
Btw, Cricbuzz came up with epic summary after the match. Struggle to reach 160 and then nail those yorkers after Rashid weaves his magic. In this batting crazed format, my team does stand out <3",19
YRKFA!,4
Delhi really needs using Rabada smartly. SRH is a top heavy team. He needed to be bowling more overs before the death overs.,13
"If Natarajan keeps performing like this, I so hope he's preferred over Khaleel in the T20I squad.",19
I know there were several positives today for SRH but for me it was Warner and Bairstow's running between the wickets that got them scoring at a decent rate despite the pitch being difficult.,26
"Oh man, I didn't know Rashid lost his family in the last 12 months. Seriously my guy, take a bow. 

Hope you rest well tonight",54
"This is what I call smart cricket from Hyderabad. Today, team that better assessed the pitch won and it really felt like Uppal",20
I've no idea why we're playing Hetmyer so low. He needs to be there in the power play make use of the restrictions and get set. We can afford to lose him early cos Iyer and Pant could steady the ship but if Iyer or Pant gets out early we're fucked.,14
Rashid. What a match winner.,13
Double aarrrrrrrsssss,4
"I‚Äôm happy to see the bowlers make a comeback in this match, it‚Äôs been a batsmen heavy set of cricket lately",12
oh wow. i had no idea rashid lost his parents within one year. the man's always smiling. what a fighter and a champion!,45
What an wholesome interview by Rashid. And Harsha asking the right questions,24
It really hurts to be losing to a weak team like SRH :(.,-42
Long term loss would help if it can kick out Shaw from the team. T20 is a pretty simple game: you need you best batters at the top. I am pretty certain Shaw is not among our best batsman.,8
This loss has made sure that DC needs Kanos as well.,28
"I am sorry for my earlier comments SRH fans. You guys are awesome!

You played a great game today!",22
This was the most chilled out match thread in this IPL,38
I think sunrisers have almost found the best lineup possible. Samad looks promising and Natarajan bowls those amazing Yorkers. We can experiment a bit with Vijay Shankar instead of priyam garg to have another bowling option and some other bowler instead of khaleel Ahmed depending on pitch  but rest everyone are just perfect as they are.,21
"Don't want to body shame... 
But Hetmeyar seriously need to count his calories.",20
"The invincible IPL 2020 tournament goal is gone.

Onto the the next goal of winning the tournament with one defeat.",19
"Instead of giving all awards for batsmen, how about some awards for bowlers? Washington Sundar yesterday and Natarajan today were exceptionally good in their bowling efforts. There are awards for most runs in powerplay, longest six etc. All of them for batsmen. Being economic in a t20 is more crucial than hitting the longest six.
Why would someone think of becoming a bowler when there are hardly any awards for most dotballs, or least runs given in death overs or something like that.",17
"Isnt it strange that the one game that they play williamson, they win???????",36
"Well Kanos won't be in SRH next year(mega auction, max 2 overseas retain..), as Warner and Rashid will be retained...I think CSK should get him and make him huge, like he deserves (You saw his shots today ?!, Dude was playing on a different surface)

Rashid is always smiling, always having fun with young guys in the team, he suffered so much in childhood and now, lost both his parents in a year, atleast his mom was able to see him amaze whole world with his bowling!!",22
Why is Bumrah bowling this short length filth?,1
