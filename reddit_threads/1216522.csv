But losing like we have been losing is heart wrenching. Obviously I am still a fan - have been with them since the first season and love them, but they are making me not want to watch their matches for the first time. 

I am really attached to them -- can't bring myself to stop rooting for them. But for the sake of my sanity, I am not going to watch today's match. Let's hope the lads do well.",2

Hello, there's something called strategy. You play out spinners with other capable batsmen and avoid risking ABD inside first 10 overs.

I got downvoted this. Might happen again.

But. 


1.  Barring the innings against CSK, Kohli has been *struggling* this IPL. 

Claims of the Sharjah pitch being a slower one by Kohli, have been finally been discarded by Punjab.

Today he scored 0 boundaries of the 31 balls that he played outside the powerplay. 
Now one might argue that it was Sundar/Dube who put pressure on Kohli but In the previous match as well, he scored only 1 boundary ( *which basically got niked* ) even while having De Villiers at the other end.


2.  Kohli *needs* to be *sacked* from captaincy. He is just not good at it. Some of the blunders in today's match include, the demotion of De Villiers & not bowling Sundar during the first 6 overs despite him being the best of all.


Had the pitch been as claimed by Kohli, RCB would have won this. RCB's bowling line up is far better than Punjab's . And 170+ should have been a par score as per the claims.

2020-10-15T17:19:57+00:00,maffzlel,"This match is a microcosm of why Kohli's batting strategy will bring him a lot of runs in T20s, and will almost always ensure that India lose to an onslaught like this. Because fundamentally he refuses accept that you have to do more than score 7 or 8 an over by picking off twos during the middle overs. I can see a match very much like this knocking India out in T20WC. 

And if he is genuinely unable to hit spinners for six during the middle overs, and is taking only singles and twos because of this, then I'm sorry I don't care what his T20I average and strike rate is, he shouldn't be playing. White ball cricket is not test cricket and making a turgid 60 or 70 over the 20 overs should absolutely be seen as a bad or match losing innings.",11

2) Don‚Äôt send your batsman in when there are 4 overs and he is under pressure to take the team to a good total. If you wanted to experiment with Sundar, that‚Äôs fine. No need to experiment with Dube as well in the same game and screw everything up

They have an amazingly balanced team option but I don't know why they don't stick to the basics.  They have the bowling this year too.

It is okay to be nervous and learn handling it, but not as a captain. His mentality is what is transcending into the team and explains why they lost 3 close games.",42
2020-10-16T05:35:01+00:00,raj_royc,In the initial two matches Virat made poor mistakes but after that he was doing incredibly well. This Hesson+Katich+Kohli trio's USP has been something that we haven't seen from RCB in the past - learning from past mistakes. So it's both shocking and incredibly disappointing performance from the men in red. I can accept AB coming at six because they took a gamble and it didn't pay off but Udana Chahal only bowling 2 overs while giving Siraj a crucial over after Saini and Morris did so well. These are things that is just unacceptable coming from the Indian skipper.,9
