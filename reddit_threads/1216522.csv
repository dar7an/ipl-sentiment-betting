RCB vs RCb-lite,100
Time to pack your bags KXIP,25
Today either Gayle-Storm or Gayle-Gone,8
"Don't disappoint today, KXIP.",8
Gayle score this match would be 13 runs.,7
Just want RCB to beat the shit out of Punjab.,3
Go RCB,5
"Imagine Gayle scoring another 175 today , I hope he plays responsibly and tees off at the end.",4
"Man, this season's pain is unparalleled. We are arguably the worst franchise in the tournament which has made us inured to disappointment. But losing like we have been losing is heart wrenching. Obviously I am still a fan - have been with them since the first season and love them, but they are making me not want to watch their matches for the first time. 

I am really attached to them -- can't bring myself to stop rooting for them. But for the sake of my sanity, I am not going to watch today's match. Let's hope the lads do well.",2
Maxwell should be dropped for Gayle but part of me wants Gayle to come in for Jordan rather than Maxwell. At least KXIP batting lineup would look entertaining,1
KXIP can win today,4
"Can't wait for the commentators to keep talking about how Maxwell can go big and how he's due a big innings, just for him to score a measly 7 runs off 12 balls.",13
So Gayle in sharjah huh. I am not having a good feeling about this,95
"Karnataka lad captaining the Punjab team vs Punjabi leading the Bangalore team.

In short, Bangalore to win.",78
Universe Boss vs Washy should be funn,19
RIP cars outside Sharjah,38
Gayle to hit 2 sixes in a row and then caught.,25
"Unpopular opinion : The opening stand is the only good thing in KXIP rn, changing that by bringing in Gayle is stupid

I'll take my downvotes now",49
I think Rahul should bat at 3 today,2
When RCB start as favorites we know what happens. I hate this feeling of RCB starting as favorites.,16
PSA - THIS IS NOW A UNIVERSE BOSS THREAD,2
"After Rahul beat Rcb by 23 runs last game

How many run do u think Chris Gayle will win by today?",1
I’m pretty sure KXIP would be way better off if they simply retained Curran. They always look a batsman and bowler short. Rahul could simply have played more freely if there was an extra batsman. Plus there would never be a situation like requiring an off spinner to bowl the 20th over to Pollard.,2
"So Gayle himself said ""the wait is over"" and gave them no choice but to select him lol. That's more like Universe Boss",28
people always ask where is gayle but no one asks how is gayle :(,150
Inb4 universe boss gangbangs RCB death bowling at sharjah for 150 runs in 6 overs,0
hope kl bats 3 and not mayank,2
Ngl it hurts not seeing Gayle in Red and gold,9
"Players for punjab today shud be

Gayle

Rahul

Mayank

Karun Nair

Mandeep

Sarfaraz

Jordan

M Ashwin

Play any 3 u want",-1
RCB starting as favorites is never a good sign lol. We love to disappoint.,7
"If Gayle is playing, fielders should be placed on the highway.",10
RCB vs KXIP. The battle for the title of The Meme Team™.  /s,-1
Gayle in Sharjah. Yeah we're screwed.,2
"Wasn't Mike hesson KXIP coach in 2018/2019 when Ashwin was captain, KXIP were making 3 odd chances every match, I thought it was Ashwin but even this season they are doing the same when both Coach and captain are chanced. Who is RTG generator in KXIP?",2
Rooting for RCB,4
Anything less than a 50 run win against this shit team would be disappointment for RCB,-1
KL should play at No 3 and not Mayank. In that manner he can bat patiently like he wants to(adapt a role similar to Iyer) . Mayank should absolutely play in the powerplays.,8
[deleted],4
Who will fill KXIP uncapped fat boy quota today?,6
"> Today inswinger my opportunity and I am happier for the fans 

Go home Cricbuzz, you're drunk.",1
As much as I'm against chopping and changing. I still like the idea of Moeen instead of Finch maybe. For better strike rate purposes. We've been slow to start ngl in most of our matches. It's usually Kohli or AB who saves us but that's not gonna happen everytime.,2
Gayle is a finished player seriously people are hyping him?,-4
[deleted],1
Any team who let us score 140+ doesn't deserve to win tournament,1
RCB vs RCB Lite,3
[deleted],2
"Yes yes yes confirmation, the universe  boss is playing!!!",2
Lezgooo bois,1
When you're performing great and are contender to win the tournament but have lost a match to KXIP,1
"Murali Kartik is on that shit that makes ur head grow

dont blame him tho, id prob like to be on it too when im 45",0
ffs Hooda is playing so Mandeep is out,1
"I m just watching for Gayleforce

Gayle out i sleep",1
Gayle and Sharjah. Name a better duo. Hope we see some biggies from the Universe Boss himself,1
Bruh Kohil has snorted cocaine,6
Haha Koach dancing during workout😆😆😆🤣👍🏽,2
Wtf is koach doing?? Someone plz hand rcb 6 losses :(,2
SRH legend Deepak Hooda to make his KXIP debut.,11
Apparently simran is out for hooda and Neesham is in as well,3
I really hope kxip doesn't try this brown voodoo name change/ color change stuff to win matches.,2
Virat is really missing Anushka!,2
How have the fucked up the team now? KXIP.,1
Who's the player KXIP is gonna bring back to form today?,2
"I wish they'd consider my feelings and just pick young up and coming players that I want to watch rather than the same oldies that I've watched for 10 years, what about MY feelings?!?!",1
Someone please send link of Kohli vibing... That shit was too good,6
A lot of r/cricket hype for Gayle so he's definitely making 7 off 11,6
Win the toss win the game?,2
[deleted],18
Hoping to see some brutal sixes by Gayle even though he is playing against us. His sixes are a treat to watch.,2
"I want to see how Arshdeep and bishnoi do against such a packed top order, they r the only good takeaways by supporting kxip",2
[deleted],10
I am expecting a Gayle storm today,2
Neroli hyped over Koach's dance moves😅👍🏽,2
ffs lol,1
RCB winning it,3
WHo taught him to dance?,3
"Lmao Kohli won the toss and decided to win

See ya KXIP",5
2020! Kohli winning tosses,10
Guys I have a bad feeling today! Tell me I'm wrong,1
Lol hopefully Kohli's dance moves can put them over the top today.,3
Virat winning tosses....peak 2020,86
"Is there a ""official Kohli fanboy"" flair?",11
Gaylestorm,7
Meme Gods vs Meme Kings. Game on.,8
Poor Gowtham. Did nothing wrong but he can't get games. Now they are trying Hooda lmao,3
man kohli needs to save some of his luck for the aus series,31
A good toss to win.,3
Now watch as Kohli loses all the toss in Australia series.,3
Ashwin has been much better for us than mujeeb,2
As a RCB fan I don't want Gayle to play but as a cricket fan I want to see Gayle play,1
Shit! gotta wait one innings to hopefully watch a gayle storm!!!,2
Someone pull up a stat for me please. How many times has kohli won the toss? I believe he has won more this season already than all of last 2 years IPL combined.,7
KL is looking devastated already.,11
Depressed as duck,2
Hooda hell is Deepak?,6
Kl been reading rcricket commentz,3
"Guys, how to watch ipl besides tv subscription or Hotstar? Can international viewers watch it? My brother from USA is asking plz reply🙏🏼",1
Why the fuck would u replace MUjeeb BCC!!,2
"Wow, moronic team selection goes on. These dumb fucks deserve to lose",1
Did anyone find it funny how quickly Koach declared he will bat after the coin landed? Lol! It felt like 2 guys passing a revolver with single round and guy realized he ain't dying.,11
Is he giving the post match interview or the toss interview wtf?,7
"I just remembered something weird (tell me if i am wrong)

2019 rcb first win against kxip, they go 

P:7 W:1 L:6

This yr kxip has the same stats and their only win has come against rcb",12
"Nah Simon I don't think even KL knows where will Gayle bat, they will pick it randomly when the innings start",11
Scenes on r/Cricket if Chris Gayle goes out in single digit.,8
Maxwell has got to have Kumble's nudes. This is beyond belief,10
Inb4 Deepak Hooda 50(24),8
Drop Maxwell win matches ezpz,2
"Lmao our middle order on paper is Rahul Pooran and Maxwell.

On paper it's strong lol. I don't get why neesham isn't playing though still.",1
Ban A B and koach😂😂👏🏽Good one K L😆,2
"FFS, Maxwell is still in the team? Pathetic",5
Punjab looking strong,2
Feel for Mayank his fine form will now be blocked by a finished player for opener,3
"They dropped Mandeep and Mujeeb too hastily, smh.",5
"Alright RCB batting first, they win the match.",4
Random bruh moment- that wavy animation being played in the bg has been taken from a YT tut,4
"The way r/cricket is shitting on Maxwell (deservingly so) and nutting over gayle, I now expect the performances to be interchanged",9
Why are people here jinxing Gayle? Give that man a break! Lol,7
Gowtham made 42 runs in 2 games. Maxwell made 58 in 7,10
Can someone explain the koach meme to me,4
"if maxwell and jordan start performing, kxip's team becomes pretty decent",7
RCB wants Gayle to fail but you know what happens when an Ex RCB player meets RCB,16
Can't wait for finch to get dropped multiple times and still make a measly score for a player of his caliber at a sr >120.,-2
Last time Chris Gayle played professional Cricket was in Jan 2020 in Bangladesh Premier League.,9
So which out of form player will kill it today? My bet's on a Finch blinder,9
I could see RCB playing Moeen instead of Udana in the playoffs if they make it,1
It’s really hard to predict the performances of even top stars. Pollard was pretty bad in IPL 2017 and 2018. People were all calling for him to be released. But MI persisted and are rewarded for it. Pretty sure KXIP is hoping for a similar resurgence in Maxwell. Some players are just built on reputation.,4
My respect to RCB for not doing that stupid name changing/ color changing for good luck after so many harsh seasons,23
[removed],5
I'm more worried when rcb are the favorites than when they are the underdogs,14
[Behind the scenes](https://imgur.com/3GxEn1g).,8
"Les go punjab, don't be shite against RCB.",2
Don't fix whats not broken. Sure finch is struggling but he is a world class player and should be given more chances.,1
"I'll be a true neutral tonight because we are not dependent on any other team's result (for a change). Having said that, Punjab's win will create some ripples and make things interesting. So, lezoooo Punjab.",3
KXIP should get smashed just for playing Maxwell. Overrated fraud,-3
"So we will be graced by Universe Boss' batting tonight. Even Rahul didn't say Gayle, he said Universe Boss. OG",5
"As a Delhi fan, supporting Punjab in this match.  Need some breathing space up at top.",15
Isn't ashwin and ravi both leggies. Oh boy lord maxwell is gonna bowl again.,4
I want proper caning of RCB from Gayle!.,3
Gayle has such a psychological impact whenever he plays,6
Love seeing Gayle and Kohli meet.,4
[deleted],9
"Chris vs Chris tonight. I'll bet on Chris, what about you guys?",1
Please thrash the shit out of kxip as revenge pleasr,3
"If Finch doesn't perform today, drop his ass the next game!",3
Deepak Hooda was in KXIP all this while? Why didn't they play him? Was he injured? Doesn't make sense to keep a big hitting all rounder on the bench,0
Siraj vs Gayle!!!,4
Gayle may be extra determined to show what a beast he was (and still is perhaps). Watch out Koach!!,8
Imagine how many cars will get hit with abd+ gayle in sharjah,4
Maybe punjab didn't drop Maxwell because it was his birthday recently. That is the only possible reason i can think of.,8
This is the match thats gonna make Gurkeerat return to the XI next match,-1
Rcb really should try to chase some totals to make sure they’re immune to KOHLLAPSES,4
What happened to Iyer? When is he returning?,2
"Opened Cricbuzz, first thing i noticed was the word positive, then saw Jayawardene's name and for a second i was on the way to god 

>Jayawardene pleased with Mumbai's positive start in IPL 2020",6
"As an SRH fan, I lol'd after seeing this in cricbuzz commentary:

> Given Hooda's finishing reputation, their top-order should ideally bat with a little more intent and freedom.",8
"Despite it not showing in his recent performances, Maxwell is probably the only person in the team who’s passionate about this KXIP team, rest everyone seems like they’re just tired and wanna get over with the tournament, Maxwell has a lot of emotion for the franchise because of his run in 2014 and also when he was captain in 2017 which is why fans are really fond of him",10
Mark Nicholas giving EA Cricket 07 vibes! Lovee itt!,3
Gaaaaaayleeeee is here against RCBBBBB,3
Kohli playing his 200th game. Wow!,12
"Sharjah the smallest ground

Gayle the biggest hitter

Commentator having fun",11
Do you ever look at someone and wish they perform good regardless of which team you're supporting?,9
Will Maxi-The taxi be able to pick any long fare ride tonight ?,6
Rcb old vs rcb new,23
"Gayle Pooran Maxi, if they fire.......",1
"Rcb only playing with 4 proper batsman. Early wickets can be good for punjab, and i think shami can do that.",1
"I remember, last match, there were guys defending the decision of sending Prabhsimran Singh ahead of Maxwell, saying Maxwell was out of form. What do those guys have to say, now that Prabhsimran is dropped and Maxwell is playing.

Now Mujeeb, the best t20 bowler in their squad, is dropped after two matches for Murugan Ashwin.
Seems like the KL-Kumble shit show continues.
The Kohli RTG( random team generator) comes nowhere close to this.",6
These previews give me goosebumps. Nice work by the network.,4
[deleted],8
"Our management’s faith in Hooda is partly the reason we’re struggling this season. Our management gave Hooda an almost uninterrupted run for 4 seasons and Hooda never failed to disappoint.  
 
By the time our management realized it wasn’t paying off and released Hooda, it was too late and there were no Indian middle order batsmen to replace him.",2
Y does Rahul looks so dead inside,10
RCB's the only team that lost to Punjab this season.,23
Can we have Finch bowling to Gayle again please?,11
The best thing about this match is both finch and Maxwell can be sent back home in the same flight !,24
Big Brain Kumble,14
Maxi???,4
Maxwell is opening the bowling??,6
Hmmm Maxwell is starting.. interesting,5
Which oversees players are on bench in RCB side?,1
Why is maxi bowling first lol,10
Kl back to keeping?,9
KL is on cocaine,8
Gayle looks ... *wise*,10
[deleted],0
Hope the openers play faster today,1
"Why r ppl shitting on Maxwell so much

He has been out only 4 times out of 7 games

N in that 1 includes kl 132* match

So its clearly seen that he has not got enough chances or enough balls to face this ipl

He has had 3 failures this tournament 

Maxwell has been shit in previous seasons i agree

But this season I disagree

The guy hasnt just got enough chances. U cant judge a batsman just for 3 failures.",1
Has Padikkal faced spin at all this ipl?,1
They had one thing going for them best opening bowlers they fucked that also,10
If maxi is even bowling a few overs why take 5 bowlers then? Wierd,1
Maxi is the makeshift Sundar for KXIP in regards to PP bowling,15
Gayle slowly turning into Sadhguru,8
"Opening with Maxwell a strange decision. Even if he sneaks through 2 economical overs, KXIP’s best strength is their new ball bowling (Cottrell and Shami). 

Shows a negative mindset to start so defensively right away.",14
Camwork in Sharjah is so shit,5
"My first time watching the dugout version, wish me well",6
KLPDIANS UNITE !!,4
Punjab is trying everything to get a ROI on Maxwell investment.,52
KL trying to glitch the matrix by bowling Maxwell in powerplay,9

"Finch either has Zero footwork or 100 footwork

There is no inbetween",66
"Glenn""Washington""Maxwell",5
"Should've picked Gowtham for today too, if he fires then he can single-handedly win Punjab the match. Mumbai and RR fans should know.",4
Next over: kl himself,5
MaStEr StRoKe,8
Maxi bringing his Aussie skip back to form,8
Can't wait Shami and Arshdeep to open our batting tonight,7
Anyone saw that Maxwell interview after he made the infamous BBL leave?,1
Upvote the Match thread guys,4
"**Mosts for a team in Twenty20 cricket**

Matches - Virat Kohli (200* for RCB)

Runs - Virat Kohli (6092* for RCB)

Sixes - Chris Gayle (263 for RCB)

Centuries - Michael Klinger (7 for Gloucs)

Wickets - Lasith Malinga (195 for MI)

Catches - MS Dhoni (106 for CSK)

*Crictracker*",11
Idk why people are surprised about Maxi bowling. He does it for Aus a lot when Finch uses him to sneak through a cheeky little cheap over at the start of the innings. A lot of Big meme league teams do it too,10
Gayle looks a perfect fit for CSK next auction,8

Ooooofffff....,2
"Bff finch hitting under the pump maxi for 6

Lol which frn does that",7
Oof,1
Finch doesn't look like an International Captain at all in IPL,10
Finch can't bat omg,3
Finchy boi stepping down to get hit in the nut to get back form,7
The only part of Parthiv’s face that has changed since he was 16 is the color of his beard.,5
Great swing from Shami,4

"GG wicketkeeping, xD.",-1

sort your hair glenn,6
"*RCB bats*

RCB fans: Is this going to be Finch’s day finally?",5
Did KL take Keeping so Pooran is 100%,7
Offspinner isn't that surprising. Left handed Padikkal and Finch is always a sus vs spin.,3
[deleted],14
"I’ve been urging KXIP to play Gayle, but not against RCB ffs :(",13
Am I the only one who feels de Villiers should be promoted to no.3?,1
Finch looks different today,2
Whys everyone acting like this is the same sharjah we saw in the first few matches? It's very clearly slowed down,2
That's a lot of footwork finch,7
"nobody:

"*Finch struggling with in swingers against pacers*

Kohli toss record is improving.,14
"How does Udana get games and Mo doesn’t?

Mo is one of the best hitters of spin around, had a good IPL last year and provides lots of t20 experience (he captained Worcestershire to winning the Blast). 

RCB don’t really need Udana’s bowling with Sundar, Dube, Morris all playing and he is yet to make an impact with the bat.

Mo should come in and be used as a pinch hitter against spin in the middle overs.",1
Virat should bowl the first over for RCB.,6
Wtf RCB playing with 6 bowlers and I'm not even including Dude,7
I wanna see Gayle bowl to Kohli and AB,6
Finch is looking to fire tonight,2
"Of course Finch would go berserk against us today, I mean what did u expect",2
foakes would have snaffled that,3
I like my head still too,1
Finch clearly trying to avoid the swing by walking down the pitch. Not a bad move but he needs to hit the balls as well,1
Y'all are on the camera. Either wear the mask as it should be or leave it behind in your hotelroom.,2
4 balls without any footwork then suddenly great footwork,3
"Kohli has taken something strong

Today on meme team Daily : KXIP open the bowling with their elite fast bowler Glenn Maxwell,16
The pitch is looking better than the last match RCB played here TBH,-1
I feel like Finch is mentally gone as a world class batsman. The fact that he has to walk half way down the pitch every single ball just makes him super predictable for the bowler and he's just a walking wicket everytime he's on the pitch. Just hope he doesn't waste too many balls before he eventually throws his wicket..,7
"Gavaskar has been doing west indian accents for ages, and still sucks ..... So idk maybe stop already !!!",3

69-2,3
I like this approach. I think Kohli will just try to hold the innings together. Sundar’s rssponsibility will be to stay there for 5-6 overs and hit as many as he can off the two leggies. Finally AB can come at over 13-14 or so,9

If it comes off, fantastic otherwise ABD comes in. 13-14 over is the best place for ABD to come. He can start going after the ball quite early anyway and he is set for the death overs. Him coming in 8th over means he will try to take risks early on and on the days it comes off it will be fantastic sustained hitting and when it doesn't we will be stuck with Sundar in death overs.",5

Hello, there's something called strategy. You play out spinners with other capable batsmen and avoid risking ABD inside first 10 overs. 

These guys are talking as if RCB has sent no. XI night watchman out in the center. The moment Sundar plays one dot ball they talk about not wasting deliveries, importance of rotating strike etc.",9

I hope Sundar stays not out,1
Peak 2020 would be RCB winning the IPL and killing memes forever....,2
"Sundar is a bowling all rounder, why is he getting so many opportunities to bat up the order. He is in the team for his bowling.",0
My opinion: Its best for rcb if he comes after 13/14 overs then he can just go at every ball without fearing loss of wicket. As it will be collapse if we lose abd before 12 overs,4
"Lol fanbois defending sundar promotion showing kohli n av weakness against leggie

Next match opposition will play 3 leggies

N they will never come out to bat demoting themselves

No way rcb is winning that",-4
Imo the commentators are way too harsh on Sundar.,10
"They're winning formula has been to avoid getting stuck too much and unleash at the end, and having world class Kohli or ABD out there is Paramount to that. There's no Rabada or Nortje here to stand against them, unless Shami turns it up big time.

Although Maxi should be travelling and not bowling decent 3 overs out in the middle tho",0
Don't mind RCB losing this one by a small margin. Will keep the IPL interesting,1
"RCB sending a leftie to slog KXIP leggies at Sharjah.

They are attempting a Tewatia.",4
"Sunil ""36*(174) in an ODI"" Gavaskar talking about scoring 40 in 2 overs",24
"People saying if KXIP lose today they're they have no chance of making it to top. 




We knew we didn't have a chance since match 1",3
"Anyone bats slowly 

r/cricket-Lets crack a lame thala joke",11
"Sunny with his maths

What a cunt",4
Downvoter chutiyas,1
Take that you losers,1
After Lord Tewatia I think twice about commenting about any batman's innings until he gets out,16
It wouldn't be a Maxwell over without one shit ball,6
Why the fuck is Maxwell bowling,11
Commentators are being unnecessarily harsh here,15
Imagine having 50 years of cricket experience and still speaking like Gavaskar 👍,84
Commentators acting like bitches. If they're bowling good spin even ab wouldn't hit them.,15
Why do rcb worry for the death so soon.Dube and Morris are there. Defensive  decision. STUPID,5
"Runrate: is near 8.5    .       

r/cricket: fucking Sundar wasting deliveries",10
Can we not let them bowl Maxi some cheap overs? Smack pls,2
Clearly Kohli has Sundar in his Dream 11 team,7
Can anybody tell me what exactly Sunder did in TNPL as he is considered as a good batsman?I have never watched TNPL :),5
"From Cricbuzz 

>jerry: ""Can anyone tell me why no ABD?"" -- 

\

>AB de Villiers vs leg spin in IPL since 2018: 

>21 innings | 170 balls | 8 dismissals | SR 129.4. 

>It is the most AB has got out to a bowling style in this period.",10
"When Koach plays a beautiful shot. Scorecard: Sundar Kohli. 

When Koach blocks a ball. Scorecard: Kohli Sundar.",3
Yall need to stop with this knee jerk reactions and wait to see the result to actually pass a verdict,5
Gavaskar savage 😂👌,-1
"Fking hell, a lot of people don't know Sundar here eh, including the commentators. He isn't a pinch hitter or whatever by any stretch of imagination. Dude is a proper proper batsman, and he's an opener in the TNPL for that reason. He's here at the moment to ensure that they have ABD safe and sound at the death where he is much more ferocious. Also, ABD is sorta weak against legspin, so they don't wanna lose him now. Hence, Sundar, who as a leftie is an added bonus, and can just knock the ball around to keep up the run rate.",19
remember today could be gayle storm in shj,2
Tv commentators baffled ABD didn't come out to bat.,2
How is the dugout today,2
I forgot that Chris Jordan was even playing,3
"It must be Kumble who recommended them to bowl Maxwell as full time bowler. It may work this match, but gonna get smacked for 55 runs on bad day",3
Punjab trying to find any reason to include Maxwell for next game,6
"Sunny Unkil not holding back there. This almost feels as disrespectful as the ""bits and pieces"" comment from a certain someone else.",4
Maxi is actually a good bowler. I remember He once won aus an impossible match with his bowling,1
I agree with commentators. Sundar is good but he ain't no ABD. You are unnecessarily taking away strike from ABD.,7
is jordan a specialist fielder today?,4
Need to see of this over.,3
Is Gavaskar high?,9
anyone got a bobby pin for maxi?,0
M Ashwin has better ethics than R Ashwin. Discuss.,-3
Feels like Kohli has been faffing about and he is scoring at 150 SR.,3
"As soon as spinners finish their quota it will be a carnage.

Something's wrong I can feel it.. 🎶",1
Kohli's running must be so frustrating for the opposition. He converts so many singles that it feels like you are conceding a boundary every over.,3
"Sunny: “Washington has wasted 2 ABD overs, which would’ve gone for 40 runs”

Sorry Sunny, but every ABD start is 9 (10). He’s not Tonking 40 runs of very good bowling in the 8th over",9
They should really be saving the leggies for ab,1
jordan just here for fielding lol,1
Damn quite a bit of options for KL for the last 10 overs,4
Chalo le aao AB ko.,2
"Sunny G - ""2 overs of ABD could be 40 runs"".

Genius. 

Let's send ABD to open the innings. That way he'll get more deliveries. RCB could score 300 easily. Why don't RCB realize this???",24
Always feels weird seeing how smol that ground is,3
Brain dead from rcb. Really brain dead.,2
Somebody tell me what Gavaskar said,2
Sundar didn't look up when he hit the ball....knew he messed up.,3
So technically Sunder wasted 14 balls :),2
Ahah nice one,2
"Oh no, wrong batsman out",4
send in Morris.,3
Proof that Sundar just came in to let Koach score before Abd explodes,5
Nobody is saying Washi isn't a decent bat. The point is that if you're gonna promote someone ahead of AB it should be in a pinch hitting role,11
Lol he played it with zero intent,5
Sundar didn't even look at the ball,6
Yes! Sundar is out! \o/,2
Sundar looked disappointed right while connecting thr ball lmao,7
"**10.3** Ashwin to Washington Sundar, OUT, **taken at long-on.** **86-3**

"What do you call when Washington is torn into pieces?

Washington Asunder",4
Big mistake from Punjab to take the wicket,6
"Spinners about to end their quota.




 Kl sends Gayle in.😎",1
Do Chris Jordan and Varun Aaron look a little alike or is it just me?,0
"Washi with 13(14)! Not blaming the young lad, but: Well done RCB think tank!",-1
Koach's shitty move done... Now send AB,-1
CoUnTeR tHe LeGGiE,2
Ashwin with the most generic celebration,5
"Washington ""Thala"" Sundar getting out.",2
He didn't even look at the ball..is this anime,7
Dube in,6
Love how inanimate M Ashwin is after a wicket lmaoo,5
Aur bhejo sundar ko,1
Bro Washington you werent even looking at the ball.,2
Murugan loves rcb doesnt he? 5/6 wickets this year vs rcb lmao,0
Was that Dube?,3
How's AB against spinners?  Would he survive till the papers come back?,2
lmao they sent Sundar in just to waste 2.5 overs,-1
Yasss OUTTTT,1
[deleted],0
I think Dube came in,1
Murugan Ashwin has such a quintessential TN face.,5
Why no AB,-1
"Send in shivam dube

Still 4.3 overs of leg spin left

Dont send Ab plz

Lmao",8
"Yo AB is injured I am telling You,,, yeh he is bad against Leggeis bt brrooooo",1
"This is why RCB should consider playing Mo Ali, he can take the attack against the spin better than anyone else apart from Kohli and Villiers",6
No ABD?,3
Wtf,7
"Following this online.

Is Gavaskar shitting over Sundar? Or cribbing about RCB decision to send him ahead of AB?",2
"ABD gand faado

.

.

.

T - ABD tear asshole",1
Damn they're not sending AB in,2
Sunny G is so salty lmao. Hold your horses boomer,3
The fuk,2
Don't let Dube walk in now smh,3
RCB choking when it’s not even the second innings yet,7
One of the worst experiments in history of experiments.,8
Pfhh...no abd...well I don't complain,2
"This is not how you play against your weaknesses, this is exposing your own weaknesses.",2
What the fuck rcb. I'm here only for ab.,7
Shivam Dubey???,3
"Pinch Hitter De Villers

Basically Shami but better",16
"Ffs, one of the best batsmen in history is in the shed, let him play as much as possible.",6
...is AB sick or something?,3
Gadhon se bhari hai RCB!!,1
Btw Gayle Pooran and Mayank is a Fuckin sexy line up for Sharjah,6
Lmao they really saving AB,4
"Can someone please enlighten me why Maxwell keeps getting picked? A ""big hitter"" who hasn't hit a six in 60 deliveries does not deserve to play",4
why the fuck is AB not in,8
RCB want to play this game in hard mode,13
"Jesus they Dube instead of ABD, lol",7
Well I like this no ABD decision 👍,6
Another shitty move,5
"I understand Iyer and Samson's no-look strokes, that's similar to what golfers do, but this was just weird",4
who decides who to send in next if Kohli is out there batting? what noobness is this,4
BKL AB KO BHEJO NA RE YAAAAAR CAPTAIN HAI RE YAR WOH MERA PAYTM KA,9
Wtf is happening,5
Sunny G was cribbing about Sundar coming in place of ABD. He will be even more upset :),2
[deleted],10
IDIOT RCB,2
AB is hiding down the order because he knows he can't bat at a high strike rate /s,2
Sundar's helmet so low blocking his eyes it looks like some Anime villain stuff rofl,7
It can be hard on AB to bat 10 overs and then keep for 20 as amazing as he is,4
Get ready boiz Chahal’s gonna wreak havoc on this pitch.,2
Uh Dube ahead of ABD is dubious,7
Another shitty move... This can cause a collapse,2
I think cutting the boss's call wuld be more satisfying than throwing away your phone..,3
What!! No ABD?!,5
Interesting to see the tight contest for the RCB title. So far some really RCB decisions from RCB and really RCB decisions from RCB. Tight contest.,6
Goddamn that turn,2
SG talking like a proper boomer,2
Yeah send AB at number 6. Why score 250 when you can score 150.,13
Bruh dube,3
"Lol, so much for the Sundar's batting support group here.",2
"Still no AB, this makes no sense to me tbh",7
We haven't qualified yet guys we are still not in the zone to experiment things :),7
I mean yeah AB is weak against leg spin but bruh he’s no tail ender. Wasting finishers so early smh.,6
"This is the new strategy: get your average to shit bowlers to bowl in the middle overs, cause they won't go after them anyway. KXIP doing good to get Maxi to bowl some cheap ones. Hold your best ones, even if spinners for the end (Bishnoi here)",1
who is in charge of this shit,7
Rcb like a jealous ex with the way they overthink things,6
I think RCB are getting a little Stitious with the hitting last match OR they're just giving the other guys a little practice against KXIP .,8
Fml they are wasting this batsman on the top,8
Why is ab keeping ffs...it's clearly a burden for the guy and he can't come in at the first 10 overs due to the fact he will have to keep for more than 2 hours after batting. Pls play parthiv or phillipe,3
So you don't want your best batsmen of the generation not to play atleast half the innings of a match?,12
AB is scared of coming face to face with Maxi's mighty offies,12
Rcb just not happy with doing well,5
RCB dressing room: we will preserve the left right combo all day,7
In B4 ABD fails,4
ABD looking weird today and also batting left handed hmm..,8
Dube was better after abd. Why abd is not in.,1
Sundar thinks he is Firmino with that no look stuff. No wonder they both are struggling (Sundar with bat I mean),4
"ABD is playing today, right?",5
RCB playing 4D chess by now sending in ABD to open the bowling.,12
Don't mind this as long as he slogs lol,2
Old RCB vibes!!,10
RCB team management has atmost 5 brain cells.,5
"The plan is for ABD to bat at the end of the innings, so he can go back to wicket keeping without a rest. 

This will be good for his back.",13
RCB it's high time you should change your captain,1
Is ABD injured?,1
so m ashwin is kxip's specialist rcb match player,2
"I defended Washi, but why still no ABd? Kohli knows they have Gayle, Pooran, Mayank, right?!",2
Abd has a weakness against legspin ffs. You dont want him in to get a duck against bishnoi or murugan. He’s better in coming later to smack the pacers,3
"What a load of shit. I'd understand if it wasn't you know, basically the best IPL batsman in the world, but having ABD is always going to better than a left-right combo...",5
"I was totally behind it for Sundar, but now I’m confused...Dube better hit from the word go or this was a mistake",3
Abd has been really bad against leg spin recently. Plus he blasted in the slow pitch last match. They would want to play that part. Can go either way but I understand the intention,1
wow dube has no 30+ scores,5
Friendly reminder that we’ve won our only match against RCB till now,4
"Kohli single double lekar hi 170 pohocha dega.

t: kohli will single double his way to 170 here",6
KXIP has saved Bishnoi for ABD and used Maxwell in his place. So delaying ABD doesnt come off as a smart decision for RCB.,5
AB tatti kar raha hai,1
"Sundar and Dube in before de Villiers, makes perfect sense.",6
No jordan.... 🤔,3
AB hiding away from leggies,6
Watch Urana and Morris come before AB at this rate.,11
I guess Vettori called Kohli and gave this shitty idea of holding Abd,7
Maxwell getting free overs is fucking ridiculous. AB would have carted his ass.,8
lmao maxwell bowling full 4 overs because they know hes gonna be sh!t with bat,4
Altroz hell yeah,4
Or is it AB is reserved against Jordan and KXIP reserving Ravi Bishnoi for ABD?,5
Getting 3 overs already out of Maxwell in Sharjah at 7 rpo is daylight robbery.,7
A wicket now can cost KXIP the match,9
[removed],0
"Abd coming to bat:

Dube: *are ye mai kar leta hu aap jake dream 11 mai jake team banalo*",24
"As good as Bishnoi and M Ashwin are, one can only imagine what Chahal can do on this pitch",6
Maxwell bowling a full 4 overs is...interesting,4
wait is bishnoi injured? maxwell bowling 4 overs?,3
Rahul should save one Ashwin over for ABD,3
Maxi the bowler > Maxi the batsman,6
Does AB have really terrible numbers against leggies,4
Bad of RCB to allow Maxwell to bowl four overs,3
RCB not playing to their strength. Shitty display of tactics,3
Calm down people. I'm sure Chahal will come in next. Don't panic.,7
[Hot Shivam Dube pics](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=star+plus+serial+actor&client=safari&hl=en-in&prmd=inv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiu3c2f7LbsAhUv7HMBHeyvBk0Q_AUoAXoECBYQAQ#imgrc=uDTwGt_5U3vFrM),3
Dube takes a long time to start running,1
I really hope this pays off for RCB. He has to get set to play like he did in the last match and he's not gonna get the same opportunity.,3
If it was just gonna be tuk tuk why not let AB get his eye in???,2
"Ok.. Now this is just crazy. So I get AB doesn't have the same track record against leggie. But this is acting as if he's a walking wicket against leggies. Also what's the point of that tactic if the other team has a part time offie, and is using it against the left handers sent up the order?",4
Ffs someone feed the record of Kohli and ABD against leg spinners to the commentators. I don't have the stats with me right now but I am fairly certain both of them have a weakness against leg spinners.,5
Should RCB have played Zampa tonight?,1
Gavaskar is such a retarded commentator,0
"I remember the time when Finch just swept spinners into the gap, then gave himself some room and launched them over covers, if anyone dared to follow him he would slog the ball 100 meters away to the leg side",3
Lol Maxi has been rather economical till now,1
AB is being saved for Jordan.,5
Dube looks so lost. I bet even he didnt expect this,3
"Whoever ask to bat , gets to bat. 

It's Dream11 *Yeh Apna Game Hai* IPL",2
I think this is a decent strategy considering RCB only has 4 proper batsmen,6
Imagine using an Overseas slot for a specialist fielder,3
RCB protecting one of the best ever batsman,7
"Idk if this is good captaincy bowling out Maxwell and not bowling Jordan, or bad captaincy. Thoughts?",3
"Swanne : ""When I get the Altroz not if""",6
Maxwell looks like he picks berries and smashes rocks in 10000 BC,33
Chris Morris next,9
Respect RCB for protecting from evening Sharjah heat,5
Where is gurkeeratman when you need him?,2
Is De Villiers in the squad today?,8
It's not necessary he'll score 70 of 30 in every single match.. gotta give him more time if he's in form. Worst decision ever,8
"This season

Maxwell bowling > Maxwell batting",7
I really want one of these two to get out so we can finally see Udana,9
I hate the altroz,2
Maxwell going for only 26 in Sharjah. Nice,7
28 from 4 for Maxwell is just ridiculous.,6
How to get dugout commentary?,3
Going by Punjab's track record they will probably release M Ashwin next year,6
"RCB with a KKR move. Your batsman performs well in the previous match, so shove him down a couple positions",1
"Did anyone else hear the ""Please a couple more dot balls, Maxi""",3
Are we really gonna let Maxi get 4 cheap overs at Sharjah?? They have Chris Gayle today ffs,8
"Well Kings have managed to sneak in 4 from Maxi, leaving all.of Jordan Bishnoi Shami for the end.",5
"Ab getting limelight after last match

Koach playing 8d chess to get limelight back

How will Ab get attraction if he doesnt get enough deliveries

Lmao",5
"Rcb: prepares for Shami 



Kxip: 😎",4
KL pulled a sneaky here by bowling 4 overs of Maxwell which went for only 28 lmao,8
Hmm... Tidy spell by Maxwell.,3
Thats confirmation for Maxwell to play next game,6
Where is AB?,2
RCB trying to make Abd the next Thala when entire world wants to become like Abd. RCB things.,6
"RCB: we'll hold AB back so he doesn't have to face legspin

KXIP: we'll just bowl off spin until AB comes out",10
Maxwell bowled well,1
I'd take 0-28 everyday of the week. Anything Maxi scores with the bat now is a bonus,5
"Maxwell might be the pick of bowlers tonight, lucky he didn’t bowl to ABD",2
Deepak Hooda in attack next,0
You can't expect ABD to play that sort of innings everyday!!,2
Pretty sure they're trying to reduce AB's workload.,2
Bruh scoring just 28 off maxwell overs is semi criminal,5
"Sundar is a bowling all rounder, much better bowler than batsman. He might open for TN, doesn’t make him a “batting all rounder”",3
Atleast Maxwell has been usefull with a ball in his hand.. because we all know hes gonna flop with bat again.,2
ABD would have at least gotten 15 more runs off Maxi,3
Virat Dot counter: 2/22,2
"4 overs 28 runs in Sharjah

N ppl were talking abt dropping maxi

Jokes on u folks",0
Media sluts already for clicks: Why ABD didn’t bat against KXIP and what is the rift between Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers,11
Y is dube on pitch? Where is ma boi AB.,3
Wait till KXIP one up this by sending Gayle at No.6,9
"AB looks like me when I was 10, sick and my mum wouldn't let me go play. So I had to stay back and watch my friends from my terrace.",2
If AB is weak against leggies that's a stronger case for him to spend some time playing leggies. Worst case he would've seen them off. Run rate would've been the same as it is with Sundar and Dube now,4
[removed],3
Maxwell has better figures in Sharjah than Rashid had in Dubai. Maxwell >>> Rashid,5
"Is KXIP saving Jordan for AB, or is RCB saving AB for Jordan? Weird ass mind games man",7
KXIP is playing 3D chess by holding Bishnoi back for ABD. RCB is playing 4D chess by sending in everyone else instead.,1
"What a bottling job by RCB, Coca Cola should sponsor them",2
"It's weird, do RCB just stop looking for boundaries in the middle overs?",1
"Rcb playing level 999 chess?

Stupidest decision making ever unless AB is sick",3
Are rcb overthinking it?,3
"Bishnoi is basically a wrist off-spinner

Googlies only lmao",1
"Idk if it's only me , but Shivam dube looks the most disinterested player while batting and bowling.",1
Now bring on Gayle to bowl.,4
"This is a perfect strategy, dube will look to slog without pressure cos abd is still left. If they sent abd first he would have to be careful of not losing a wicket as there’s still a lot of overs and no batsmen after him",3
Here's an idea: maybe AB hasn't come out because of his horrrible goatee like facial hair. Way to ruin a good looking man,3
Koach keeping AB away from batting so that he has less competition.  /s,3
AB against our death bowling at the death and 90+ runs in the last five is on the cards,1
Swann hyping Altroz like it is Audi A3,5
Current state of KXIP: Maxwell is their bowling all-rounder,3
Jordan might now bowl if Bishnoi completes his 4 . Why is he in the team again?,2
Kohli and ABD: in Kxip death bowling we trust,3
"All these Tik Tok clones are so cringey, they even dont bother coming up with something original,  even rhyming names ffs",3
Either ABD is weak against legspin or RCB making ABD a Wicketkeeper rather than a batsman,7
I know it's easier to sit around and talk but why can't you give yourself room and pull it. The ball is not turning that much so.,3
Why isnt AB here yet ?,2
Sachin seeing Kohli uselessly holdback the best hitter in the team : “Now he’s FINALLY following my steps”,3
KXIP extracting every bit of money spent on Maxwell,2
Downvoters still here?? Upvote this cross ✝️ again to scare them away,24
neesh should have played over jordan today,3
"Lmao, how ABD hide his face",2
So Dube basically has 0 footwork against spinners,4
How can koach be this stupid,1
"Gotta feel for kxip man, I hope they win",2
"While RCB is busy protecting ABD from leggies, KXIP's best leggie still has 3 ovs and it's 12 ovs already",3
What the hell is going on? Is this not the same pitch as before?,1
We might still win but this makes no fkn sense whatsoever,6
"From what I remember from those DLF IPL trading cards, Gayle had a 100 score in bowling as well, bowl him too lmao",9
Is ABD injured?,4
RCB fked it up,1
So is the pitch really slowing down that much?,1
Dude looks so uncomfortable against spin. Barely any foot movement,1
Are Jordan and ABD even gonna play?,3
Dube playing like a gube,13
"I get holding AB back but at the same time, surely you want him facing as many balls as possible?",8
Bishnoi would bowl till 17th over and AB 'afraid of legspin' Devillers would come for the last 3 overs then.,5
I think it's time for Kohli to crack down on the spinners,2
KL has his orange cap stuffed in his dick wtf.,20
This is pathetic ffs 🤬🤬,4
swann jordan is playing as a long on fielder lmao,4
Does RCB really think ABD won't be able to hit tomato-can legspinners around the same field in which he demolished KKR 2 days ago??,6
tuk tuk tuk tuk!,3
They let maxi go for 7 an over only. Jeez,3
"> nor is Murugan ashwin a capable replacement

Glad I waited before replying, sometimes performance matter more than intl name and fame",3
"Hasn’t Chris Morris opened some innings in IPL, night as well give him a go if the openers play like constant pussies",3
Maxwell should open and reverse sweep sundar.,4
No crowd is boring but then I find positive in the fact that I don't need to see a random Bollywood celebrity in the crowd. Can't escape owners for obvious reasons.,3
Kohli gone into Thala mode after the power play,9
I want Bishnoi to dismiss Dube here,3
This is not slow pitch Koach... You desperately need AB,14
Swann’s asking if they’re playing Jordan as a long on fielder 😂,9
Funny how this whole time the Universe boss was warming the bench and as soon as the transfer window opens they play him. I wonder if its to make him want to stay?,9
Big Brain Hesson,6
Loved how Kohli smiled acknowledging the fact he was denied the single due to sheer brilliance in the field,12
How about not getting dube out?,3
"A batsmen with 4000 runs with 40+ Average and 150+ Strike rate is not good enough to bat 4-5, imagine the 2 players above him. Must average 50+ for sure!!!",20
This middle over batting rut will come to bite back RCB one day,9
Putting way too much pressure on ABD.,13
"RCB are overthinking, how can they think Dube will play leg spin better than AB lol",10
"RcB FixeD MatCH, tHEY DidN'T sEnd aB /s",3
"A Kohli Ton is on the cards!!!!!!
COME ON BC",3
Has AB ever batted at 6 for RCB?,8
RCB has only 8 overs of spin. Damnit,4
Swann should join an orchestra.,3
Dubey hasnt got a wide stare.,2
"Me looking at rcb middle order

Ee ka bawaseer bana diye ho",3
Dube trying to be a Dhoni there,5
I still can’t forgive that Sachin basically did the same but in an IPL FINAL! Sent Harbhajan at No 3 or something SMH.,4
Seems really difficult to hit spinners. I expect Gayle might come on next.,5
Umpiring error count: 1,2
"As this is Kohli's 200th match for RCB, looks like shitty RCB management don't want Abd to become the highlight.",6
Good fielding by a KXIP player. _Cameraman pans to Jonty Rhodes._,10
Stupid batting,2
HE APPEALED FOR WIDE WHERE ARE THE HATERS NOW,9
RCB is just trolling us at this point,7
"Nehra was the original GOAT of dinda academy even before it was a thing, now commentary box has got a GOAT of worst commentators",3
Dube chale chaube banane.,1
Kohli to Dube after 15 overs: destroy yourself,10
Swann auditioning for beat boxing,4
Scenes if the umpire gave a wide there when Kohli asked.,5
Good guy Kohli has empathy for a struggling team,10
Dube doodh peene ka time ho gaya ...,7
Dube you dumbfuk,3
Rahul calls ravi bushy lmao,6
I don't know why I support RCB just because of AB... Who's being wasted here,5
You hardly expect a match in Sharjah to be this slow...,4
"i think the pitch has slowed. but given that, why send dube?",3
"Despite being his biggest fan, I really hope Ab goes for a golden duck and RCB lose by 10 wickets!!!",-3
200?,2
Dhoni would have gotten a wide. Kohli not yet experienced,7
MS Dube with the stare,3
How did this guy make it into the Indian team again?,1
"Come on, ABD isn't worse than Dube against leggies",3
WTF is Swann doing in the dugout.,2
Dube in a mood to hit the ball straight towards the umpire.,4
That Uncle who takes Pant's catch in the Dream11 ad always gets me,5
It was really nice to see Finch and Kohli respect Maxwells bowling,5
Dube with that sexy 6(9),5
I really think ABD had a bad back. Nothing else excuses this,3
Kohli usually starts accelerating when he comes closer to 50. So he will tuk tuk till he crosses 45,2
"Fuck Everything.

I need to know WHERE IS DE VILLIERS !? 😡",4
Just 3 runs from that over. A mistake to not send ABD,5
"Just a reminder that KXIP death bowling hasn't been good , Ab **could** still go on to score 50 odd",2
If Dube doesn’t fucking hit 20 next over I want him dropped next game. Horrible misunderstanding of the situation and he doesn’t even bowl anyway,3
Only 40 runs in the last 7 overs ffs.,6
The entire momentum being sucked out of the innings. These are the overs which are most responsible in case of a loss,5
"Why do teams underutilise morris' batting so much? Delhi did it when he was our most explosive batsman, should've sent him early instead of sundar",8
Teams fucking up in middle overs I feel,1
"Guess what, after Sundar and Dubey having played 3 overs between them, KXIP still have 3 overs of leg spin. Even if de Villiers fails it's better to bring him on early rather than shielding him from leg-spinners and losing out on possible runs.",1
Kohli was 17 off 9,1
The wall doing ads.,2
RCB trying their best to gift this match to KXIP. Kohli was moved after his chat with Rahul.,9
"Dube is so unimpressive in every game I see, despite the couple of sixes last game. I don't get how he makes the RCB lineup every game and even more astonishing is he played a game or 2 for the national side. There is nothing he does well it seems other than connect on a few slogs here and there.",6
Scenes if Ab gets out early against pacer after all this shielding,7
I think the explanation for the batting order shuffle will be *We wanted to test the tender middle order and get them to face more balls for the upcoming matches*,5
People on street near roads to warn cars of balls coming there,1
Dube should swing every ball now,3
Sharjah traffic is as bad as Bangalore.,1
"Kohli running a quick single
Le Kevin Peterson "" you beauty..excellent fap material""",2
Murali “the fag end” Kartik,2
"22 off last 4 overs, Dube gotta double down and press that lofted shot button Everytime now.",2
I thought dube and sundar were sent to try and tonk some 4's but this tuk tuk gets on my nerves,4
Punjabs yet another weak link is here,1
Why are they treating AB as if he's  a pinch hitter who can't play a proper innings,2
"Why does AB always need to play under pressure to score at breakneck speed, he could have gotten setup properly this time",1
I love Jordans butt and I'm straight,1
I made fresh popcorn for 400+ runs game in Sharjah with Gayle playing. Now I am disappointed,2
Dubey .Swing your bat otherwise go,1
"No 4s since last wicket, bruh",1
Dube is...not good against spin,1
so now ab will have to go from ball one,2
Goddamn Preity Zinta still looks a solid 9/10,6
"Guys guys chill

ABD is being saved for smacking Jordan tonight.",3
"Oh I see Preity Zinta is in the stadium, that’s why we’re lucky today <3",2
Dravid in the ad looks like a fifth standard schoolboy doing his first ever presentation in the front of the class.,2
Fill your boots up moment for Kohli.,1
Wtf Mahendra Singh Dube 😳,3
Friends i dont think ab is playing today,1
I believe rcb made a mistake for not bringing in abd earlier.,1
Ivngaadru baarsro,3
"Gotta respect Kumble and KXIP management commitment to recovering their investment in Maxi. We paid you millions, so you are gonna play every match.",3
Imagine being the greatest player of the generation not only in T20 but in test cricket and being afraid of spin,2
"Jordan isn't coming in with a lot behind him but he's got the skills, don't let him settle",2
Bring in a real batsman,1
"Dube staring long at the umpire for not giving a wide. 

What does he think, is he Thala that he can pressurize  Umpire to change the decision?",6
pinch hitters playing as pinch setters.,4
"So rcb thought Ab cudnt make 19 of 23 with spin on

So sent washi n dube ahead",3
Preity Zinta is back? I thought she left UAE....,1
Pretty sure Hesson goes through r/cricket to come up with his tactics.,2
Is ABD injured?,1
Jordan actually bowled well against Aus during their recent series. Don't know what happened in Dubai,1
Excited to see England's best t20 bowler in action,1
Preity Zinta hasn't aged at all.,8
4 Jordan overs on the trot?? So +80 runs right,1
Carnage begins now...,2
Dube has to hit or get out.,1
Why the hell he's called captain fearless when he takes such fearful decisions,0
Dube channelling his inner Tewatia,2
Ms Dube,3
Preity looking pretty,3
Getting a little panicky rn,4
Dravid's energy in the ad is same as mine in class,3
"Idk what RCB fans are whining about, KXIP have proven repeatedly 145+ is well outside of their capacity.",6
Accelerate Dube ffs,3
by the time AB comes innings might be over.,2
100 finally,1
"Would suit RCB if AB gets out without scoring, holding their best batsman till the end and putting a lot of pressure on him",3
Did ABD suddenly fall sick or something? Or is it Kohli Random Team Generator's work.,2
Guess Dube has to put on KXIP Jersey.,3
WHAT THE FUCK IS DUBE DOING HIT THEM BALLS FFS,7
A wicket here could be catastrophic for us,7
"Yes Murali, maybe the players know the pitch isn't as conducive to hitting as we expect.",2
"Fuck off dube, what is this conspiracy to not let ab play.",5
RCB saving AB for next season lol,6
"Dhinda academy ask the experts:




Why are we shit?",-2
Dube's batting worries me,3
RCB in last 7.1 overs - two boundaries. If only they had a world class batsman in their side who plays aggressive cricket (more than Kohli).,7
Dube playing like its day 1 of test match,5
RCB must be expecting AB to smack Jordan for 15+ an over to compensate for this batting from Washington and Dube,5
Only rcb sends two nightwatchmen in a t20!!,5
4D strategy by RCB to make commentators talk about ABD and not Dhoni.,4
Preity Z's still got it 😏,7
Still 3 overs of spin left how much will they hold AB,7
RCB tryna make Jordan look like Jofra Archer,11
Sundar should have lasted longer. That big shot was unnecessary.,4
I'll get corona and recover before abd finally gets to bat 😒,7
No intent™,6
"RCB Fans: *Please no RTG*

Koach: *OK*

RCB Fans: *No, fuck no. Not this way ffs*",5
"Jordan coming in to bowl at the death 

“OH NO NO NO NO NO NO”",3
Imagine not hitting Jordan 🤡,2
Shivam take the hint mofo,3
I think George Bailey would make a good addition to the dugout commentary box. He had a good cricketing brain and also a very laid back speaking style that would be apt for the dugout.,4
Dube needs to freak the fuck out about any second now.. please,2
Don't take a wicket here,2
"Dube or 3D Shankar, who would you have in your team?",3
"Damn Jordan not conceding too many runs today, is it my birthday or something today lmaoo",5
Dube giving trials for the upcoming Ind vs Aus test series. 😇,3
Maxwell only conceded 28 off 4 overs. ABD would have made sure he went for 40+,3
This kind of batting doesn’t compare to Pooran and Gayla ffs,2
Does Hesson think ab cant take singles?,2
Fuck off dube.,1
Preity back cuz she knows RCB,2
ffs discount Pandya,2
Dube get the fuck out please,4
Dube's world is so fast that we mortals see him in perpetual slow motion,4
"Dube 7(10)

Sundar 13(14)  
Vs   


An inform AB sitting in the dug out. They are playing like this is a knock out game.",10
Pingo pongo is back,3
"Have a midterm tomorrow, this better be worth it",8
Dube is not even trying to hit lol,3
"Dube cmon, you need to go",2
sending ABD at 6 is a VK ploy to ensure that he doesn’t outscore him 😊,2
KP giving no fucks and bashing offies when Karthik is in the Comm box,7
"Did KXIP saved Jordan for later part of the game, lolol. He is the head of Dinda academy in England",6
Imagine Dube getting Kohli runout.,6
Even 12 an over won’t get them to 180 now. And they’re not planning on accelerating,6
"As an SRH fan, I am liking this tuk tuk Dube",8
Running b/w wickets™ all the way for RCB tonight,3
WHERE IS ABD,3
I say fuck this shit,1
I so want Kings to win this game not Because RCB battered us. I just want to see a chasing side win a game or this IPL will become dull.,4
Where is the INTENT?,1
I'm gonna abuse Dube now and after 3 hours there better be a Dube apology thread.,7
Dube bats like a fat guy,6
The memes if ABD does not get to play.,12
Kohli trying unwanted shit,3
What the hell is Dube doing . Fixed? s/,3
There must be a reason Dube is playing the way he is. AB might not be 100%,5
Should have sent Morris instead lmao,4
When was the last time ab batted at 6 for rcb,6
The amount of pressure put on AB after this is insane,8
Wtf is happening,2
Jordan isn't really a wicket taker. So just dots singles and doubles would be good. Don't take wicket Don't bring abd. 999 IQ from punjab management.,3
Gayle is not facing more than 10 balls on this pitch.,6
Dube+ Sundar 21(26),6
"Dube looks dead inside, **what happened to my man?**",7
Sorry but why was ABD pushed down in batting order?,3
RETIRE OUT DUBBEY,4
Fuck you Dube,6
RCB and it's brain dead think tank back in action.,7
RCB middle oder exposed,3
"If only Nehra had used even 10% of his knowledge that he shows in comm box on field, he would still be irrelevant",7
I don’t even remember when I last saw a boundary.,6
"Dube gotta start swinging 

Kohli ab and Morris are still there",2
This is seppuku,4
Rip rcb,1
"Dube and Sundar to AB: Main jaa kar batting kar leta hoon aap Dream 11 par team bana lo! 

T: We will bat you make a team in Dream 11 app.",5
Great over CJ,3
last 5 overs 28/1,7
CEAT tyres strategic peetime.,7
"RCB don't deserve a title.

Absolute clowns for management.",5
Time out! Finally.,2
They had to hold AB back to level the playing field. It's only fair,5
"ABD in dugout, no big intent from the replacements sent, Kohli not showing his usual intensity.

Sometimes makes me wonder if all those talks about IPL being a scripted reality show are true.",7
Any tactical reason why AB is held back?,4
"Ffs, someone please hit something",3
[removed],3
"RCB team discussion yesterday - KXIP are generating more memes than us what do we do? 


Let's hold Abd as long as possible.  


Done.",9
Imagine not loosing a wicket and Ab de can't bat,13
All this BIGBRAIN strategy to play Sundar & Dubey ahead of ABD is gonna turn into BRAINFADE if ABD gets out early,12
Poor.Very poor by Kohli and RCB.Sending Sundar was Ok but sending Dube now instead of AbD is absolute shithouse.,18
Dube you are not here to build an innings ffs,5
This will definitely put pressure on AB to hit when he comes on to bat which might ultimately make him lose his wicket.,16
So... um.. why exactly is AB not batting up the order?,3
Gayle to chase this down in 3 overs,8
Inb4 Chahal is sent in as a pinch hitter ahead of AB,12
McDowell's ad is so cute. All friends hugging🤗🤗,1
Good stable innings from RCB. They must have some good plan.,1
Kumble only wants to win this match!,2
Seriously what's the point of this?,9
"Looks like the downvoters are gone. You know who to thank

What a shitshow,5
"I remember people saying Dube as next Yuvraj, hmmmmmmm",4
"You know what's worse than having your weak middle order exposed?

Exposing it yourself",8
even morris was there if AB would have got out.,3
Dube wants the test call mb,8
"Not a single boundary in these middle overs in sight, at least hit some 4's",4
Where is AB bitches,2
If they wanted to experiment they should have sent Morris ahead but still why?,9
[deleted],12
Imagine farming Chris Jordan for singles while fucking AB is in next lmao,8
Looks like RCB respecting ex-rcb by doing tuk tuk,2
Kohli is just not a good captain,4
This is what happens end up being dumbest but being the most skilled.,2
Maybe they wanna keep load off AB,1
Did Kohli consult Kumble about ABD’s batting position today ?,5
[removed],3
Don't blame Dube.Blame people who think he should be batting ahead of AB,3
I think Moeen might play next matches to counter against spin we have the worst run rate in middle overs no one to murder spin.,6
"So they have sacrificed AB's batting, so that he can keep for 20 overs? Because that's the only logical explanation I can come up with.",2
Kohli to Dube in the strategic timeout: **WHAT THE FUCK?**,2
"Maxwell gotten away with 28 from 4, Jordan 6 from 1. This keeping back AB strategy looks suspect.",5
ABD is still not in the middle. This is will be reason RCB will lose today with atleast 20 run loss.,8
100 in the 14th over in Sharjah is a crime.,2
"RCB getting overconfident and treating this match as an experiment, they could pay for this",5
Rcb fucking retarded management again.,3
Are you even playing in Sharjah if you don't hit a ball that lands on the road?,2
"Imagine if CSK played Faf at 6. 

r/Cricket: REEEEEEEEEE",2
"First 6 overs : 57/1


Next 8 overs : 46/2",5
"RCB relying on KXIP to throw the match away.

It’s been a pretty effective strategy so far to be honest!",1
"RCB has 62 in 6, and 40 in 8",1
"So they have sacrificed AB's batting, so that he can keep for 20 overs? Because that's the only logical explanation I can come up with.",3
RCB knows what they are doing. Koach is on field. Stop knee jerking y'all,0
"RCB were like wow we are doing everything right, lets spice things up by sending Dube before ABD",4
Do you think Kumble would say hello to Koach during timeout?,5
"Rcb timeout conversation: what's the least sus way we can get Dube out on purpose hmmm (no hate, just wanna see some pinga ponga)",6
Is kohli jealous of abd,0
Not sure why they held AbD behind? He should be coming out to bat before or after Kohli nevertheless. AbD is not a Russell or Pollard to be held behind. He is proper batsman who can change gears and play according to the situation.,5
They’re really not playing Moeen on this track hmmmm,3
Koach v Kumble. It was right in front of my eyes.. took me 14 overs to realize this.,10
Maybe Sundar and Dube are just being given batting practice,4
i dont really understand these tactics. but its def made the match more interesting and even keeled. for a minute there it looked like rcb were running away with it.,6
"RCB, why didn't you experiment this shit strategy vs KKR??  :( :(",2
"Cool. So Kohli at Post Match Presentation Today, 


""We were thinking anything above 160 would be great""


**OR**


""We fall short of 20 runs. 180-185 would've been great""",2
tell shivam to accelerate or die trying,5
"   
**Time out!** RCB need to reassess their plans as the move to send Dube before AB is backfiring as of now. Yes, they are a batsman short in this game and have no one of the prowess of AB to finish an innings, but holding back one of their best batsman might turn out to be the difference between victory and defeat.",5
These MG ads are terrible honestly,2
"“Oh long part of the ground and gone for six!”

Hands off to whoever can recognise which match this is from

Clue: Universe boss",5
Katich be like aye cunt hit out or get out. I'm on r/cricket match thread and they are not happy!,7
"First 6 overs RCB scored 57/1, next 8 overs they have scored 46/2.  Wtf that's not 6 runs per over for 8 overs in a 20 overs game. That's 40% of the innings where they have done fuck all.",7
Dube = Indian Inzamam,2
"if kohli opens with padikal this is will be my 11.  


Kohli

Padikal

AB

Moeen  
Dube

Morris

Sundar

he's a better batsman than you Koach... When will you get it.,10
"4 overs of Maxwell, genius move by KL.",8
"If Ab is 100% fit

This is the worst decision i ve ever seen in my 11 years of cricket watching history",1
Swanny shut the fuck up for god's sake. Abd is in form.,0
Why change something when you are winning? I mean ABD should have come after Sundar,7
Imagine telling AB Dube bats better than him against leggies. Prime Shithousery,8
"Calm down every one, there is still 6 overs left, they can go 190 easily. Koach is in good touch. It's a matter of time he will shift his gears. Don't be reactionary.",8
That last over from Jordan brought his econ rate for the tournament down by 0.5 runs per over. That's how horrible of a tournament he has been having.,3
"It isn't a bad strategy tbh...

RCB will probably make the playoffs. Giving some game time to other players is good imo",2
Last match thread I was talking about how RCB should think of an option where ABD gets to play more and set himself up for unleasing after 11-12 overs and they literally pushed him further fuckin down the order?,2
"Dube will slog sweep, bishnoi will goggly",1
Shivam ***Dube***yega rcb ko,1
Will Dube slog against Bishnois Googly?,3
"Rcb fan, but I hope they lose this game. Fuck you.",2
Yea Dube wont be converting those 1s to 2s,3
Does rcb have the most international captains in their team?,1
Every RCB fan must be muttering fucking diabolical under their breath right now.,3
"Dube will slog sweep, bishnoi will googly",7
This is how koach disgusts you even after being the most classy batsman,2
"KXIP : We are the new RCB


RCB : Bitch please !!!",9
Always rated dube,2
Brain dead stuff by rcb.,1
That was BIG,3

Shivam tewatia ?,10
With that Dube single handedly shut this sub down.,5
Abhi nikla Shivam,6
"Out of the ground, good shot Dube",1
Fucking finally,3
Finally,1
dube channeled all the meme energy that he could muster and yeeted it man,1
Fucking hell.,2
Too short,2
"Bishnoi still has 2 overs left, so idk what's happening anymore, we got to such a good start

But wait DUBE JUST HIT A SIX, while I typed this out. Interesting.",3
Dube shitting on this sub,3
As a king's fan I'm getting tewatia ptsd,6
"Hot Damn.

That was maasive.",1
Ffs Dube. Finally.,6
At least gurkirat Singh Mann could would have got his first battling chance lol,1
"People need time to settle in on slow wickets. Asking AB to go from ball one is not fair to him. Might work, still not fair.",9
"Question, does someone go and get the ball back after it leaves the stadium ?",1
Finally. Dube. 6,2
What does Kohli actually offer? Clearly not batting and clearly not captaincy. His fielding also led to KL Rahul accidentally playing a decent innings,-4
"Last match DK played with five bowlers including Russell and just one spinner, he is just clueless at times",1
"Just tuned in , can anyone tell me if ABD is injured or something like that",6
"Bangar:""He's a strong boy""",10
RCB can still get 200,1
So what were we saying?,5
Why they not send ABD?,1
God why,1
New cricketers on the block were fed enough proteins since childhood and it shows,2
"Just tuned in , can anyone tell me if ABD is injured or something like that",1
Lmao they gave him compound V in between timeout,0
Uh-oh.,1
Lmao,1
This is why bitches,4
Dube: FUCK THE COMMENTATORS,1
Wtf were you doing till now?,2
"Last match DK played with five bowlers including Russell and just one spinner, he is just clueless at times",0

Kohli and co let him bat at 6 this game",2
All will be forgiven if ABd doesn’t come in to keep today. Then we’ll know,2
Dube doing a Tewatia,7
/r/cricket in shambles,8
Lmao they gave him compound V in between timeout,7
"All the bandwagon retards

SHUT THE FUCK UP",12
Dube to r/cricket 🤫,12
I wonder what Parthiv Patel is thinking about right now,7
Do you think one day Kohli will take a run and commentators won't masturbate to it?,4
"Can anyone explain the reasoning behind why ABD is still not on the field? There has to be some logic behind that which I don't see....

Edit: I guess because of Jordan? Had Dube not fired this would've backfired hard still.",2
Hmm Looks like dube is gonna get out,0
Cmon boys,3
Tewatia flashbacks,7
Tewatia entered the game,5
Oi fuck off,6
Shivam Tewatia?,2
I want Gavaskar to eat his words.,1
Bishnoi is usually great against lefties. Will make a comeback,2
KP still having MSD hangover.,4
r/cricket in shambles!,7
"RCB - How do we fuck fantasy league teams today? 

Let's not send Abd. 

Hahahaha.",11
IF YOU COULD BAT LIKE THAT WHY DID YOU WAIT UNTIL NOW!?!?,2
Show r/cricket Shivam!,2
"r/cricket: Shithousery

also r/cricket: Masterstroke",4
So everyone is trying the Tewatia gambit now?,3
Dube doing a Tewatia.,9
Thank you finally,3
"also this game is the best time for rcb to experiment with their strategy. they are in the top 4, they are playing a really weak opposition and they have nothing to lose.",7
Freaking finally... But still I don't think AB will get more than 10 balls here.. they're gonna be 20 runs shirt atleast,7
*Hey r/cricket talk naah*,9

Dube says fuck AB,2
This match is the answer to the question What happens when an unstoppable meme team meets an immovable meme team?,14
Koach gave some super pep talk,5
You guys pissed Dube off,5
Just proves that the people complaining were right? Why did we waste 25 balls before someone hit a shot in anger,3
r/cricket once again with their perfect analysis of the game,1
Did Kohli just signal ABD to pad up?,9
Dube Dube goobe 🦉,9
Drop Finch and get Moeen,3
Its STILL a wrong decision to send Dube,7
Lmao the uprising of dube fans on the thread,10
Free runs lol,3
Dube cunting 2 sixes...better give the credit to Virat loooool so shameless,7
This subreddit has amazing ability of meming a player into form.,7
I think ABD is unwell.,7
Even the cricbuzz ad says bowling leg spinner to a left hander is a bad idea,8
[deleted],7
Fucking finally,6
"Its a small ground, but 91m is huge too...",6
Bishnoi under big pressure here,4
Morris coming next?,1
"Dube: yeah r/cricket, talk nah",7
"My fucking god that runup, Chahar would be proud",7
What run up lol,7
Decision to send Dube wasn't wrong. That it took until now to smack was wrong,2
KL cannot be a long term keeper for India. His keeping is too ameturish,6
"People trashing Dube in the match thread. Here you fucking go. This is Dube. No touches with no service, but when he does get it, it’s done. Level Tewatia.",11
Dube is also fast af damn.,8
"RCB has had an uncharacteristically good IPL run, now they're going back to their roots by not playing ABD. This table ranking is just too unfamiliar for them.",13
What's sticking out of KL's trouser?,5
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT RUNUP,10
Bit of Yuvraj in the 2nd six.,3
Lmao they are trolling Kohli,10
Chahal is batting next,48
I think ab has either an injury or fever,10
Koach telling AB to pad up ?,16
[deleted],10
imagine not sending ABdV on small ground Sharjah😒,10
KL Rahul put ABD as captain in his dream 11 team. Kohli not even giving that little victory to the Ex-RCBian.,33
How do they steal single there?,5
"Kohli called for someone else to pad up?

Wonder who he wants in next",8
[deleted],31
"Funny, I think Kohli is saying Dube will hit the legspinner..",8
So Koach expects AB to come and smash from ball 1 when he himself eats some 30 odd balls playing like odi,5
At this point I’m sure ABD is not well,29
"man AB's back is a problem

drop finch with phillipe so he can open

or 

play parthiv to open and moeen in the middle.",7
Guys AB is probably unwell,9
Lol Bishnoi doing that retarded Rahul Chahar run up,7
Is ABD injure or sick?,4
Man dube isn't gonna get out,2
"HUGE over, that.",6
Kohli can complete a double even after stumbling. I mean!!,15
Let's not judge too early ! We will know the reason for abd not batting up the order.Chill guys !,1
dube reading r/cricket comments on his VR helmet.,14
Kohli finessing 2s in Sharjah is mint,26
r/cricket: *Drop Kohli*,36
Have to restrict them under 180 to stand a chance,6
"Ok Shivam job done

You can leave now",2
"If ABD is not well, why even play him?",8
"For the guys saying ABD isn't well, then why he's in playing XI? I'm pretty sure that's not the case.",12
That run up is pure shithousery,5
Every year during Gayle vs RCB I comment 'Universe Boss vs universal loss' but it seems like this year it is different for RCB,8
I ll cry if Dube doesn't get out in this over as ABD is my Vc,9
Incoming Kohli carnage...,7
Koach can make a century just running doubles,5
It's baffling why they wouldn't promote Morris up the order.,6
This is why we were concerned with AB keeping,8
"If AB is sick from the beginning, why not play Parthiv or Phillipe",9
Was Koach about to fall while running?,7
I hope everyone is ready to apologize to Koach here. He’s asking someone to pad up. CLEARLY something wrong with ABD. Not brain dead decision making,14
"50 crores in winning every game

Why isn't abd out,1
"10rpo will get us to 172, need more.",2
Kohli's taking revenge on these fantasy 11 apps,7
Kohli so determined to play along the ground. Surely he can hit few out of the park in this small ground.Holding back for later,5
Tactical drop. Fuck you rcb. So wanted to watch abd.,6
"So apparently Kohli asked a wrist spinner to pad up, and people think it's Chahal.  

Did he instead ask a slower-ball bowler to pad up? Udana has a T20 strike rate of 145 with a highest of 84.",5
tactical drop,7
Maxwell 100 IQ lol,8
Amazing how many runs you can make in an over when you try to hit sixes,10
Kxip can actually win the game if they don’t take a wicket now.,12
Maxwell dropping dubes catch on purpose lmao,11
Tactical drop?,3
"For all the Dube fans

Let dube score a 33 ball 73

Then we will discuss who is better at 4",5
Mark Nicholas is a psychopath confirmed,5
Oh well tried Dube. Kohli would have killed him had he been Runout,7
Ffs almost ran Kohli out,3
Surely KXIP'S plan here is to not get Dube out,2
If AB needs a break rest him ffs,5
4dchess from maxwell,3
Dube would've copped a mouthful if Kohli was runout there,8
Goddamn... if i had Whitehat Jr when i was a kid would have had VC/Businessmen fight over my Hello world app...,14
Dube tryna get out here but we won’t let him,7
"**AB de Villiers at No.6 or Lower in T20s**

Inns - 7

Runs - 93

Balls - 54

6s - 4

Avg - 18.6

SR - 172.22",8
I miss the old Jordan.,5
2 sixes does not make this decision correct lol,8
Stop fking calling that a drop....it clearly landed short of Maxwell.,4
Imagine Dube’s prospects rest of IPL this year if Kohli got runout there,6
Pretty sure u guys didn't know that ceat timeout's purpose is for players to read comments on r/cricket,7
Sending Dube up the order was a dare given to Kohli.,5
Anthony Joshua with some good bowling here,4
That's the Jordan who played in England. Dipping Yorker,7
ABd doesn't look fit this keeping pressure is too much for him at this fragile age need to bring in either Parthiv or Josh,7
That yorker was a combination of Rabada and Bhatia,9
Jordon striking form today of all matches FML,10
Lmao Jordan spitting fire today,8
Dube with a brilliant innings for KXIP.,4
Damn Jordan *has* to become McGrath against RCB,11
What's with Jordan and his Yorkers today,6
"Dube can't get out when he wants to, can't get runs when he wants to. Poor guy",5
J-Jordan...bowling well? This is beyond science,10
I hate watching VK hit himself. Ouch,5
What a beaut,1
Dube go for the big shots mate,7
"Dube is trying, but he’s no ABD.",4
Shivam dube is going to last the whole innings isn't he?,6
"So, ABD just had to come out against KKR and fuck things up for us??? :(
I want to launch an official protest!

Anyways, KKR is going to lose the next match against MI!",8
Is our death bowler coming in form,5
Jordan found his lines finally,2
if they feared ab will get out. They had morris and udana to tonk the ball.,18
I would definitely rather lose this match than risk ab's health going forward.,6
Can we call a Keeper substitute?,7
"MUCH better from Jordan, don't want to jinx though",6
Good to see Jordan finding somewhat form here for his own confidence,5
Koach about to say Ben Stokes,3
Thought that brushed the pads,3
"Irrespective of how much Dube eventually scores, those 12-15 balls he showed no intent^TM for, have been wasted",9
This is a fucking insult to abd.,8
Nehra is unbelievably obnoxious.,7
"Blame is on managment, not on dube",6
Obligatory Jordan wide,3
Ex RCB player shining once again,2
What if ABs sickeness is Covid,-3
Hahah. RCB thought Dube will be a filler for 4 5 overs. But this ploy has flopped royally.,2
"You heard the dugout, RCB the cute ones.",4
Rcb doing reverse kxip bringing players in form,6
No way Jordan goes at under 10 with ABD.,7
ABD died for this,12
Hope AB is okay.....he is so important for us,6
Nehra is so salty over rcb lol,4
Damn...ngl kohli lookin pissed.,14
No boundary wtf I'm getting anxious 😒,3
Is this pitch very hard to bat on?,2
Petition for Dube to get out hit wicket as Punjab will make every effort to not get him out,2
[deleted],-1
FFS AB is probably injured,2
Mistakes were made today by rcb lol,7
Bring on ABD,5
Arshdeep vs Koach could be good,1
Brilliant first 2 overs for Jordan today,1
I'd have dropped it tbh,5
Bass... Karwali beizzati,3
KL just made KXIP lose again,9
"Kings11 plan is not to take a wicket, and legit it's a good plan. Keep ABD in the dugout and make RCB suffer for being too smart.",2
Finally abd will come.,3
YAY!! ABD,4
Kohli angry mode on!,2
"If abd doesn't come now, I am sure he's injured or not fit",3
Even the hindi commentary is better than mark and kartik,3
Jordan redemption arc,6
I've never begged for a catch so much in my life.,2
I am very happy for Jordan actually.....,3
"Lol why was Ashwin dropped, he's so good wtf",3
Ffs KL NOOOO,3
Jordan's bowling tight tonight. Great stuff.,1
Will ABD walk out or anyother lefthander Remaining?,2
stupid KL why u caught him 😑,6
Send deviliars you cowards,1
YESSS,1
Jordon 5rpo. Wtf! 😔,2
I wanted them to drop the catch :(,2
Damn KXIP lost their mvp,1
Other than bcci even Nehra's family pay him money so that he isn't at home talking nonsense,9
ABD and Kohli masterpiece incoming...,3
JORDAN,2
Arre kyu out kardiya,5
Yes thank you Jordan,4
Dube so shit he’s giving Jordan wickets,3
"Damn, impressive over from jordan",6
Fucking finally,2
Duba Dube,2
"Rahul fucking his team over.

Edit: I take it back, KXIP will strategize another way to lose.",6
"KL lost punjab the game, such an easy drop missed!",3
Virat doesnt look a happy man out there atm,4
He's coming,3
Bring morris you cowards.,6
inb4 morris,1
"Drop the catch, ffs",3
Its interesting how CJ basically stops after his run up,1
They should have done a tactical drop,3
Yes!!!,1
Rahul's cap is shining,1
Ab might not be well,1
"Jordan with competent death bowling?

Did someone hypnotise him into thinking he was playing for England or something?",5
Holding back ABD must be one of the top 3 bizarre decisions of this IPL,8
Ab in there,1
Imagine if they send someone else than AB now.,4
Our prayers are answered. Dube is out,5
RCB: *This little manoeuvre is gonna cost us 30 runs*,8
Only Rahul knows he didn't wanna catch it lmao,3
"No amount of mental gymnastics can justify the baffling batting order decisions. If ABD was sick, why play him. If he is not sick, why hold him back?",4
Fuck. Not going according to plan here.,3
I wish former RCBian Gayle fires,1
Wtf? Chahal shoulda come out smh,1
Chahal will come in next,1
No goddamit that only brings AB in,2
"Send in Chahal, you cowards",2
RCB strats in shambles if AB gets out cheaply here,8
Look at AbD coming in now and smoking the remaining 24 odd balls that he gets to play.,2
"4 overs left. If AB had 2 overs to get in before this, 200 could have been on the cards",7
I hope ABD gets to face atleast 18 deliveries,2
Rcb wouldve been a lot better with Gurkeerat in the XI. Specially on this ground.,1
Please Koach now let him have the remaining balls,2
Dube with a Manish Pandesque innings,5
Should have dropped that kl,2
AB in and M Ashwin is straight back into the attack,1
He coming? He coming?,2
I was saving this: You cant call others reactionary when you're excited after a couple sixes,4
"The plan should’ve been for dube to get out by the 15th while slogging, waited too long to start slogging",5
"10 from 2 along with a wicket, absolute top spell this",3
I think AB is in the team today just to stop a choke,3
Ofc Jordan gives 5rpo with a wicket against Rcb,4
"who is coming next?  
This is like dhoni in the world cup game vs nz",5
Ill take the next 4 overs for 50 runs thanks,1
"So happy for CJ, had a rough tournament but bowling beautifully today!",6
Lmao KL should have dropped that,3
Jordan needed universe boss in his team to execute Jamaican.exe,4
Now ppl gonna expect ABD to hit 60 or something here and obviously the mad lad is gonna do something of the sort,5
"Wait, AB wasn't unwell? 😐 Boli makkla why",4
Jordan getting in groove finally,1
Chris Jordan doing a Micheal Jordan here lol,1
Is it time to play Parthiv or Philippe?,3
Umm. ABD. Ok.,1
I can hear Preity Bhabhi shouting why would you do that,1
1st wicket for Jordan in the tournament.,3
360 Destruction incoming,1
"So ABD was not sick, clearly braindead captaincy",3
"**15.6** Jordan to Dube, OUT,  **127-4**

S Dube c &dagger;Rahul b Jordan 23 (19b 0x4 2x6) SR: 121.05",2
Scenes if chahal walks in,3
AB overcoming *the runs*,2
ABD about to rip into us now,3
Really happy for Chris. He’s a top lad. Just wishing the tournament gets better and better for him,8
Hahaha they bring Murugan vs Abd,6
Why did Maxwell bowl 4 . Bad captaincy,0
ABD was not in Virat Kohli's MPL team.,3
I don't think it was koach s decision to hold ABd back. It was katichs,4
"Why Rahul didn't drop the catch, stupid, lol. ABD unleash incoming",7
Catches don't always win matches,7
Now AB have to go and try to hit from the first ball with no time to set himself up. Not great decisions were made today.,6
"*Jordan finally does something good*

DJ: RCB! RCB! RCB!  ABD! ABD! ABD!",9
Rahul has to bowl a leggie here.,2
Get ABD out first ball please.,2
Please another 50 here AB,5
Ashwin was reserved for this.,2
Jordan > rabada + nortje + archer,7
"Had this been gully cricket, I'd willingly drop the catch. Who would you not want to bowl in death overs? AB or Dube",6
"I cant understand RCB sending their most inform batsmen and one of the best of all time, 4 down, why were Sundar and Dube sent before AB? Does RCB camp not think abd is capable of a longish innings??",6
"Confirmed 

Maxwell IQ >>>>>>>>>>>>> KL IQ",12
I can't wait for Kohli's explanation on AB batting order,13
ABD. Good. I was afraid Chahal was going to walk out.,5
I wish we could get Saini bowl some beamers to Nehra but it shouldn't hit him of course.,4
Virat “scream after every ball” Kohli,4
Slip against ABD on 17th over. Bold.,6
A thala decision this from RCB,9
I have a feeling that this is going to backfire.,12
Wait Murugan???? Why,9
"Virat: I love batting with AB

Also Virat: Has AB come in at 6",21
I know people are probably mostly joking about intentionally dropping it but remember how everyone was talking about Tewatia needing to get himself out vs KXIP before he Tewatia'd a win?,13
If AB had come sooner he would go after every ball from now,14
Bring Gayle on you cowards,15
jordan going to bowl four on the bounce? i wonder if they've figured something about him getting stiff if bowled early and late,8
Kohli should’ve got out instead of dube,5
"Joradn should have said ""Drop Drop"" instead....",7
"Dube is legitimately worse than Bumrah against pace. It's not even agricultural, it's just no. 11 tier batting.",8
Chris Jordan is the poor man's Joffra Archer.,8
[deleted],-3
Kohli signaling to the dugout that there is massive spin.,11
"Arshdeep can bowl 2, Shami can bowl 2. Why Murugan Ashwin now?",5
We Bowled a lot of spinners today,6
Is this fixed? Why isn’t Kohli firing? This is agonizing to watch now. They have 2 big hitters coming up as well.,2
"From what I've seen in 2 IPLs, Dube is entirely average. Don't know what Kohli sees in him",4
Okay. Here's what I think why AB is playing so low. Koach might be testing his middle order who haven't gotten a lot of opportunities to bat. Just to give them exposure. But the timing is a bit off tho. Ngl,3
I am not ready for another VK-ABD cock sucking fest.,5
"For the first time in my life

I want Ab to get out

Just to say

Fuck u RCB U were wrong",4
Yeah we're fucked.,1
Koach knows it's KXIP. They'll find a way to lose. So he's let the random team generator loose on the lineup.,14
Kohli following the footsteps of Thala,4
"Kohli: *now I’ve become Jadhav, destroyer of RRs*",-1
Wtf was that a square turn ?,5
Chahal and Sundar are going to wreck havoc here :'(,10
Maxwell should be captain of KXIP Rahul made a mistake lol,4
"I don't think they would send AB at 6 on purpose, its either a niggle or something else so please calm down guys.",7
Imagine under using a player like AB when you know he can win matches single handedly.,2
Kohli to bowl legspin himself in second innings,11
Worried about Chahal bowling here tbh,3
"Maybe AB was taking a dump when prev two wickets fell, only explanation why he didn’t come out to bat earlier",7
Selfish of Kohli to deny Universe Boss a century here,6
Amazing over from Ashwin,5
The guy who made 73(33) coming in with only 4 overs left make it make sense,9
Scenes if AB goes first ball,8
What's with this strike rate of 120,2
So how do you explain AB coming so low? Injury ?,3
Nehra must be so smug now,1
Deepak Hooda playing as a specialist batsman irks me way too much,6
Bitches. Stop whining. And enjoy the game.,7
"still not giving strike to AB, fk u Kohli",1
M Ashwin also hella good today,1
"Jesus a team tries out one new thing

Half of r/cricket : fiXed cAptainCy bAD",2
Man spin really gonna rule over these pitches in the coming games,1
ABD had bavasir,7
"6 runs in the 17th over, well done Punjab",6
"Probably KL has whispered STRIKE RATE IS OVERRATED in kohli's ear, so scoring at staggering 120s",9
"10 overs too late for AB.  
Finch got out at 6.3 overs.",6
So 2 overs by Shami and 1 by Bishnoi? Hope we cross the 170 mark,1
"Hate to see it when teams just fuck themselves over with the strangest batting positions. KKR with Tripathi after Cummins, RR with Stokes and Uthappa swapped, now this shit",5
Kohli taking doubles in Sharjah is top tier comedy,8
Good job Murugan,3
M Ashwin is very underrated,3
"If best players should face most deliveries, why do we have the concept of opening batsmen, no. 3, no. 4 and finisher? 

Why don't we just send them in descending order of their batting ability? 

For eg, At his prime, Dhoni should have opened the batting for CSK?!",1
"Sad to see a guy with a test average above 50, an ODI average above 50, and an IPL average above 40 be relegated to play like Dwayne Bravo",10
Do you still bring in Bishnoi?? Risky with small ground. Also he might be low on confidence. But I'd gamble with Bishnoi.,1
Can we get 60 from last 3?,2
Kohli needs to hit out himself now,3
Why tf is kohli so happy. Has he seem his strike rate. Isn't he the set batter.,5
Kohli saw AB was the only one who samshed on this ground in the last match.. rest all of them were rusty.. and still he didn't give him time being in that terrific form. What can be a more dumb decision,3
"Now, it's a kohlapse or a destruction",2
"Conflicted on whom to support, RC Bangalore or Karnataka XIP...",8
I hope people don't say match was fixed coz they didn't send ABD earlier,3
Expo 2020 held in 2021/2022?,3
Batting a bowling all rounder and a slogger over one of the greatest white ball batsman of all time lol,2
Love AB and Kohli playing together but omg these commentators need to stop......,3
Why were Kohli and dube playing tuk tuk if abd was coming next,5
Need to get at least 170 to have a competitive total,5
170-180 is absolutely nothing at Sharjah. KXIP will chase it down with an over to spare if KL and Mayank get going again. This AB at number 6 strategy backfired hard!,4
Wow Kohli. So proud of you.,3
"Expo 2020, held in 2021-2022",6
Bruh Kohli has a bald spot.,1
If kl played like kohli today you guys would have demolished him,10
Should've kept going with CJ,3
Kohli should come next game at 6.,4
Abd looks sick,1
Kohli and ABD struggling to hit in the 17th over of an IPL. This pitch must be nasty to bat during spin.,6
Now lets see what havoc preserving Ab does in possible max 17 balls,1
Obviously there's some concern over AB's fitness,2
Surely Arshdeep is bowling one over here ?,2
"Shami no bueno, won't mind if you change my mind tho",2
No Jordan?,2
Virat “i never hit boundaries” Kohli,-2
💋,3
Inb4 AB gets out  on 7 (9)  and Kohli has to carry the score to a respectable scorr,2
cameraman spotting preety chicks in the audience,7
Both Ashwins had back to back good days,4
peak komedi,1
Shami for death?,2
"AB vs Googly since 2017: 
55 runs, 56 balls, 7 dismissals, Average 7.9, SR 98 

RCB was trying to protect him from 8 overs of legspin, particularly googly specialists",7
Kohli isn't timing the ball well at all.,5
"Death seems really tough to score, teams have to make use of powerplay more",4
60 in the last 3 overs?,4
Kohli is the ultimate stat padder in T20s imo,4
"Parthiv, Padikkal, VK, ABD, Gurkeerat/Dube, Moeen, Washington, Chahal, Morris, Udana, Saini",1
Both Kohli and AB struggle against googlies. RCB held ABD back for this purpose only. I won't be surprised if they give next over to Bishnoi.,6
"My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.


Not a joke",3
Arshdeep better than Shami in death no?,3
Absolute boomer commentary,3
One of my uncle who eats gutka claps his hands similarly as they show in kamala pasand,3
Fati padi hai. png,5
Whatever RCB is making KXIP will chase it down in 18th over.,3
ABD ate camel roast. Told him not to.,7
"Kohli has really lost his edge in t20 cricket tbh, can't bat at a 200+ strike rate anymore",-4
Braindead rcb,6
Imagine struggling to hit a six at Sharjah,6
I think Gayle gonna go from ball one on this pitch,6
"**Highest SR in death overs (16-20) in IPL 2020 (minimum 25 balls faced)**

232 AB de Villiers

226 N Pooran

225 Faf du Plessis

224 E Morgan

220 J Archer

214 M Agarwal

*Cricbuzz*",15
ABD has vampire canines,6
Maxwell at an economy of 7 and Jordan at fucking 5 is criminal.,10
"Sending in Sundar made sense. Dube, not so.",9
"Only one of Dube or Sundar should have come ahead of ABD 

And in the hindsight it should have been Sundar.

Maybe ABD isn't 100% fit ? but then why would  he be keeping ?",17
Jordan legit finally showed after 2 mares that is a world class death bowler. Rahul “well no I ain’t having none of that shit”,5
Lmfao,3
Well done RCb!!!!!,3
Is the pitch slow? That's the only hope rcb have in defending,6
Bhakk.,1
"Unkill Sunny, what happened to his 40 runs off 2 overs for ABD theory. Sundar died for this.",13
Fuck :),3
):,1
F in chat bois,3
Gone,2
Rcb lost,1
Well done Koach,1
"4d chess move by RCB, if they don't score enough runs Gayle won't be able to score a hundy against them.",11
We are fucked,3
Welp there goes all that build-up,3
AHAHAHAHAHA letzoooooo,6
lmaooooooooo,3
OOOOOOF,3
Good night boys,9
RCB washed,3
F,3
Yeah.... 69D mover by RCB failed here.,9
"Well,,, fuck.",5
Shami Milk Truck just arrive!,3
Why,2
Who didn't see this coming 😒,6
Great RCB just played themselves,7
Oh boi oh boi,3
So Kohli's khelo dimag se decision worked sooo well. What a cricketing brain,5
Lmao ABD coming in at 6 to do that,5
What are we waiting for?,2
Hahahahahhahahhaha!!!!,6
We made a deal with kxip that we will lose again,2
Tactical Decision,2
LoL RCB think tank,3
Lmfao,6
Ngl i saw this coming,4
Okay we are fked,5
Fuck off rcb management. Beyond useless.,3
AB was robbed.,8
Pls win this KXIP I want you guys to,8
Send in AB at 6 for him to get out at 2 runs,7
ABD masterstroke failed.,9
Shit,3
I think this pitch is getting slower very fast. Chahal going to destroy punjab,7
"W     H      Y

H

Y",12
This match is a throw. This is so pissing off.,6
"Ya protect Ab more

Bat him at 8 next game",10
can't give AB only 4 overs to bat!!,9
BwhahahahahahahHA,2
Something not okay with ABD,3
Kek,1
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined,6
Kohlapse?,2
Idiotic captaincy from Kohli. Sending Dube & Sundar before ABD & Morris is so stupid,5
Fuck this shit maa chudao,9
guess this is where our good days end,6
Lol...what a botch from RCB,8
Experimenting when you are winning and arent guaranteed a spot yet. Guess they are embodying *Play Bold*,9
"Be RCB

See ABdV play like a freak in the previous game when everyone struggled 

Keep him in the dressing room for the next game

???

Profit",7
[removed],-4
Oof size: Large,5
FUCK RCB mngmt,3
Kolhi and management are the clowns here not abd.,6
"I'm gonna go against the grain here and say this was a good strategy.. Not because I think ab should be shielded. But because the other batters deserve some time out in the middle.. Rcb are in a good position on the pts table and will probably make the playoffs.. You don't wanna end up in a must win game, lose your top order and have to ask sundar and dube to perform without having much match time.. Plus it's Sharjah so sending dube and sundar in wasn't a bad ploy.. Gotta back your players and give them game time",16
"Ho gaya?
Chutiya management",4
"Haven’t seen KXIP play this good since they played against, well RCB",69
Let's see if Koach can dig himself out of this hole he dug himself into,8
bruh what is this shitshow,9
I miss Dube now,3
Mood kharab ho gaya bc,7
"Big brain koach, well done",6
Kohlapse™,8
Fuck off Hesson you stupid bastard,4
ABD shows again that /r/Cricket basically doesn't know shit about cricket.,1
Braindead from RCB. Probably lost them the game.,4
"Well, that's a mighty F to the RCB management.",7
"Too much to ask from ABD

He scored 73 off 33 and he comes in when 24 balls are left, and you expect him to get going right away and score a match winning innings?!",10
"RCB go out of their way to screw up, truly. Give your best batsman hardly any deliveries. Genius",5
Fuddu rcb,2
Koach strikes again,3
wont blame devilliers for that wicket. reatrded RCB management is behind it.,9
Haha well that was an anticlimactic waste.,3
Such a foolish decision to send Dube over him. He already showed that he can be a match winner on these slow pitches.,3
Good. Now Sunny and KP might shut up about AB's batting position.,0
"What a strategic misfire from RCB. I expected that Sundar would bat well and if that fails AB will come, but Kohli not accelerating and Dube playing a meh innings has hampered them badly.",3
Think Kumble had a drink with the RCB coach last night 😔,6
"Today, Dube > Finch/ABD/Padikkal",2
epic fail,2
RCB fans need to chill. It's us you are against,4
It's official. RCB made ABD a specialist Keeper.,3
"RCB in winning form

RCB : We don’t do that here",6
"**17.3** Mohammed Shami to de Villiers, OUT, **taken at extra cover.** Full and just outside off. Wants to loft this over mid-off. Ends up getting that off the toe-end with the bat turning in his hands. And it's an easy take for the backpedaling Hooda **134-5**

AB de Villiers c Hooda b Mohammed Shami 2 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00",4
All that tactical maneuver for this. Tai.. Tai .. Phish.,2
Kohli is the last hope now.....please go crazy,2
You know Punjab will find a way to lose this lulz,1
Looking at Kohli even 160 seems too far rn,4
Please God don't want to lose to KXIP this season AGAIN,2
Alas No cock-sucking fest today. Just VKs 1s and 2s,5
Want to See Gayle absolutely Pummeling Sundar to Oblivion,3
Waiting for yall to praise Kohli after Punjab struggles to score 140 against Chahal and sundar,11
CMV: black bourbon should be the only version of bourbon allowed to exist,2
RCB reverting to form. 2020 might yet end on a normal note,2
Imagine if we'd given ab some time to get in..,4
My day has been ruined. Wtf rcb you shitheads.,3
"Kohli gonna milk some two's now and get to his 50. Best captain, best batsman.",3
FUCKED,1
Only RCB can fuck up a strategy that worked well for them :/,7
"Great job treating a player of ABDV’s calibre as a pinch hitter, you played yourself RCB",7
"Lmao, RCB managed to fuck up the unfuckable.",9
RCB now realising they have won too many,6
Of course rcb is gonna be the only team to lose to kxip this season,4
"Slow clap for Kohli and Katich. Fuck off you idiots, my fantasy team is fucked because of this.",2
Vintage RCB moment?,4
The pitch is slowing down so much. Punjab will have to bat out of their skins against Chahal and Sundar,6
Oh the meltdown if Morris fails,3
Atleast get to 160,7
"'Strike rate is overrated'

-The entire RCB team by the looks of it",9
This whole innings has felt like RCB trying to gift a win to KXIP.,6
"Whenever situation presents him an opportunity,  Koach finds ways to prove that he is a bad bad captain.",3
ffs we are gonna lose to kxip again,4
Gotta say KL has used his bowlers very intelligently. Sliding in 4 cheap maxwell overs was amazing. Even after considering the wack batting decisions. Very tough game for RCB right now. Need  Kohli to fire.,3
Someone remind RCB they are playing in Sharjah not Dubai,2
"You have to send in AB earlier, he had no chance to judge the pace of the wicket, even last innings he took 10 balls o get going.",3
Surely a front runner for the Altroz Brainfade of the tournament,3
They did this to themselves.,5
Retarded from rcb. Why would you not give your best batsman more time to settle in? Heck AB and Kohli would have stolen 10 extra runs in singles alone,9
Shami hat-trick incoming,1
By giving dube a chance to play rcb gave punjab a chance to win again against them.,3
"Tactical masterclass from RCB, send Sundar and Dube to play at ODI pace and then put all the pressure on AB to smash from the first delivery at the tail end of the innings",6
The only justification is RCB didn't want enough runs,3
"[Guys, I think I've found the reason for today's strategy](https://ibb.co/PZyhTYr)",3
RCB's strategy has been baffling in this match so far.,3
Everyone be like: Todays match is fixed bhai,3
They’re trying to make AB the finisher when dude is pretty much the WHOLE batting these days,2
Punjab gave back the cheese touch to RCB,1

This match is huge. Opens up the 3rd and 4th positions to just about everybody.,1
AB too good to be a last over slogger.,6
Classic VK,1
Are they really gonna lose to Punjab? I’m excited for their bowling now. They only have 2 spinners.,7
Imo they feel confident they'll qualify so thought to test dube and sundar now rather than be in a playoff situation where they have to depend on them then without more game time.,8
Shaminator,2
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL,2

Well bowled Shami 👏🏻,2
Is this game gonna be the turning point for RCB's winning streak? They do have a history of falling ridiculously from the top positions in points table? Let's wait and see,2
imagine getting AB and Kohli out within 3 balls,4
Lmao I hope Chris Gayle fucks the NRR of RCB now,6
We gonna lose twice to this year's KXIP lol,4
This was typical RCB fuck up we always see.. they just got into their previous character competing with ex RCB,2
"Even if punjab lose, this was a terrible strategy. Kinda like kkr. The end will not justify the means",3
I don't know why you all shocked at the weird decisions so far. It's RCB vs RCB after all!,5

V Kohli c &dagger;Rahul b Mohammed Shami 48 (39b 3x4 0x6) SR: 123.07",3
Rcb still need atleast 160 to make a match out of it.,4
I'm excited to find out just how spectacularly KXIP manage to fuck this up today,7
"I guess kohli wants his good friend Kl rahul to win against RCB  
Otherwise in no logical sense you send a guy who made 73 (33) last game to bat so low.",8

"Last match ABD was smashing an all pace attack in Prasidh Cummins Nagarkotti Russell.

Are we going to be the only team that loses to KXIP twice by huge margins?,7

So I went away to watch the PS5 UI video and WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?!,4
"Regardless of the AB debacle, can we appreciate that Kohli was 15 off 7, and then got out 48 off 39. That's 33 runs in his next 32 deliveries. Not from the end of powerplay till the **15th over** did I see him attempt to hit a boundary. What good is his low dotball percentage when he plays so meekly? Who cares how many cute twos he hits and how hard he runs lol? What the fuck is the point if he's effectively going to euthanize any aggression he has in white ball cricket in the name of staying in all innings? Absolutely diabolical batting.",13

"Sunny saying ""look at that distance"" repeatedly as if 64m is impressive",8

"Ok seriously how many of you really know what happened there?

Do you really think ab fucking devillers is afraid of some uncapped legspinners

Even if they want him to be shielded, one batsman is ok, why Dube? Why say pad up to morris?

I think something else happened, so till we really know what happened, can we fuck off with this knee-jerk bullshit",12
"On a serious note observing Koach over the years, the problem with his personality is that he has too much energy. He is never satisfied and always wants to improve. So even when something is going right, he would tinker and in the process make it worse.

The exact oppiste of MSD. MSD knows when something works and sticks with it (sometimes too long). I see that similar trait in Rohit Sharma.",20
ideal KL paced innings will win this unless punjab fancies a sudoku.,10
"Morris has already changed our look with his bowling, now is the time to show he can do the same with his batting.",11

Was that Steyn with the beard?,4
160 would be decent enough if we get Gayle out early,11
"Even a 160 would give the bowlers a chance, but it feels tough. Is it a difficult surface for batsmen? Or just rcb being RCB?",16
"Gavaskar : look at the distance!

*64 metres*",18
Can someone tell me why ABD was demoted? What did they expect? Him to come out and fire all guns blazing? Was it Koach being Koach?,1
Okay i dont think Kohli is so dumb (atleast i hope so) to send ABD at no.6. I'm thinking ABD isnt feeling a 100% this game thats why he came down the order.,11

How are the bowlers doing more than the batsmen could,2
Let's see if KXIP can find new ways to shit the bed.,8
Is hooda doing laps of boundary ? Why is every ball finding Hoods ffs?,1
RCB could’ve scored 200+,2
Our Hooda channelled his inner Pandey,2
Shami dude plug runs. You are conceding runs to bowlers,1
This may be the first 6 from a Srilankan player after a long fucking time,5
[removed],-8
Two dots in coming,4
Udana and Morris are underrated hitters.,8
Its one of that freak Morris innings isnt it,11
"Yeah boi Morris, show 'em",4
"These 2 should’ve been sent up, making Shami look clueless.",6
Lmao,3
Lol ...shami being shami ....getting hit in his last overs.,3
Love morris so much,4
Morris performing over exceeding,8
What a shot from Udana,4
Chris Jordan Gayle Morris,8
"If this sentence fucks with your mind, it's because it's ridiculous, true and false all at the same time: ABD is playing as a specialist keeper today.",5
Lmao last over Shami is same most of the times,3
RCB gonna promote Morris and Udana next game with ABD coming in at 8 due to this.,1
ABD and Morris switched bodies,5
so the death over specialist gets 3 while shami who suddenly forgets how to bowl in the death  bowls the final over??,3
Holy Bangalore that's what we needed from Sundar and Dube,5
Lord Shami giveth and Lord Shami taketh,3
Morris should just open.,5
"So this is that 230 pitch lmao

Good luck winning koach",1
"I said it , KXIP death bowling hasn't been good",3
"If they really wanted to protect AB, Morris should have come",10
Shami being shit at the death in IPL... Tell me something new,6
"Isuru udana's highest score in t20i is 84, so rcb has one more all rounder",16
Chris Morris revives all hopes.,6
Seeing Morris and Udana hit sixes makes me scared of Gayle,16
"Yep, Morris was worth every single rupee",17
It's Chris day,7
Shami peaked in the match already. No motivation any more,2
Just Bowl Yorkers dammit!,2
Morris: Hello !! Is it me you looking for ??,6
shami thinking slower balls is helpful now lmao,3
4D chess by koach by getting out to shami so that morris and udana can cunt him.,7
Yes dadddddy,3
Man these two are hitting it so cleanly. where the hell was this,9
The Sri Lankan and the South African to the rescue,16
"Who is the meme team

RCB : us

KXIP: no me",7
LETS GOOGOGOGIGIG,6
RCB favorites now.,3
Faf would've caught that,3
Yeah Morris!!!,2
Morris senpai owo,3
death bowling masterclass,3
Should have sent Morris before abd as well.,8
Imagine sending Morris below Dube and Sundar.,8
Morris toeing the ball to six is foreshadowing Gayles innings,9
Chris Morris is the type of player Dhoni would send opening,8
Bro are u fking serious.,10
Poor death bowling,2
Kohli probably thinking he should have brought in morris before abd,6
Lmfaooooo peak meme,2
"South Africans are having a very good IPL.

Dekock, Faf, Morris, Rabada, Nortje",3
"N rcb thought

Ab was their only player who cud hit long ball

If he gets out there is no finisher",1
Morris: Today I will be AB,7
RCB bat bloody deep now,2
AbD blessed Morris.,3
Right after the commentators mentioned Shami has improved his death bowling,7
"Goddamn it, everyone please shut up with these reactionary comments. Devilliers' back was probably hurting hence he came down the order",5
Wow Morris...,2
Shami can't accept the economical bowling,3
FML,1
South Africans making IPL worth watching,4
I was thinking that 171 would be nigh impossible at the beginning of this over but they fucking did it good god.,6
lmao KXIP I feel for ya guys buddy,3
"RCB is just falling into place again! Morris is their man, they should have given him more chances.",3
"Big oof

Bad over from Shami and I think that's got RCB to a decent total",6
"Shami taketh, Shami Giveth!!",8
RSA bowling lineup looks stacked for next year's ICC World T20,6
Bruh,4
Morris giving himself a total to defend,9
Thank the gods for Morris and his hits,9
I am very happy with the last two overs.,7
Morris has once again proven his worth today,4
How did Morris miraculously became this good? Shit he's so better now,3
Oh Shami.,2
More than anything it is usual shit bowling by Shami. Great wicket taker but leaks run like a bitch,3
Morris you beauty!,4
imagine playing with Virat's strike rate on this ground 😒,-2
"Shami had a brilliant last over removing AB and Kohli (big ups), tried too hard against Udana and Morris and travelled",3
"One Chris ended it well, I hope another starts it good too",3
KXIP tried their best to help RCB in the end,3
LORD MORRIS 🙏,2
SMH,1
Still got to 170 lolol,3
Man! That last over tilted things,4
Reckon rcb is still 15-20 short. Hurts that they dont have as many spin options on this pitch,8
What a fucking finish by Rcb!!! Morris just saved Koach from a lot of backlash!,9
Stick cricket over by Morris here,9
"Very disappointing last over

Think we have learned we still cant trust Shami at the death",11
"Ah yes, that's the KXIP death bowling I am used to",20
Morris you beauty!,9
cameraman zooming on kl’s face hahaha,7
"Holy shit 24 over the last one

Always expect the unexpected with RCB",13
Eat hair Kohli for not unleashing Morris earlier,1
It ain't 2020 KXIP if they don't ruin it just at the end.,6
[deleted],2
170+ could be a winning score here. This last over will make all the difference in the outcome.,3
[removed],6
"LOL we got 170 😂   

Still a bit low, but at one stage 150 looked clutch.",8
"IPL Trophy is for one year, Memes are forever.",7
"In hindsight,  Bishnoi should have bowled last over.",1
"Morries and Udana hitting sixes at will. 

ABD definitely had something going on, maybe an upset stomach?",6
Arshdeep had an over left,4
Wow hahah & I thought Punjab can win this,3
I fear what Gayle can do on this ground,5
YES BITCHES,3
And kohli couldn't hit any boundaries smh,9
"Win the toss ✅

Bat first ✅ 

Score 170ish ✅",9
Umesh yadav smiling somewhere,6
Shami studied well for Kohli and ABD. Morris was the chapter he skipped.,7
Koach should have just retired in the last sharjah match. Abd and morris would have probably got 220.,6
"Honest to god, if Morris didn't exist, this thread would've torn Viral Kilo a new one, and rightfully so",12
"Death bowling..yes, shami died",7
"Whoa, Morris. What a shot!! 

Morris and Udana, the perfect lower order for RCB.",7
Why does this always happen to me?,7
Morris and Udana > sundar and Dube,33
Shami is not a good death bowler.,5
"BC kya team hain yeh!

T: what the fuck is this team!",5
now imagine if they didn’t have a shitshow in the middle overs. the score could at least be 200,9
Morris premium is paying off.,9
"Oh fuck yeah, Morris and Udana. Morris really has changed our look, and not just with his bowling. Fucking awesome.",23
YAH r/CRICKET TALK NAH,3
Thank you Morris,5
Wow. Cricket is a great leveller. He just removed AB and Kohli in the same over and got smoked for 24 runs in next over,12
Fuck you RCB. Look what Morris and udana did. Gayle pooran Maxwell Rahul and Mayank are ALL equally capable,4
Last season it was Steyn that changed the momentum for RCB this year it's Morris,7
Goes to show the pitch isn’t toooo difficult.,1
Kings 11 are gonna lose by 11 runs.,6
Those stupid puns that pop up on the screens in the ground like 'Chris Bliss' just now are actually amazing,9
RCB and SRH out-Pakistaning each other,8
Shami absolute dogshit at the death,7
"Shami got way too cocky getting out Koach and ABD, so much that Morris came out of syllabus",16
Morris back to his best.,7
"That last Shami over sums up KXIP's season really.
Leaked way too many runs.",8
Shami prepared for Abd/Kohli but Morris came out of the blue,16
[deleted],35
Should have sent Arshdeep imo,2
KXIP trying to balance the match by that last over,7
Lol. Watch punjab chase this in 15 overs. Goodnight guys.,3
"morris, what a chad",9
Last two overs could make a difference.,8
My childhood rcb would have folded for 120. What's happening,12
Just glad that more people are going to jump on the Morris hype train now. His express pace and ability to hit long bombs really went unappreciated when he was with us,14
Shami is abysmal at the death. Even Unadkat bowls better,1
So Morris was the Tewatia,7
Morris was spectacular!,9
mc outside off daalnhi skta tha,1
This is why Bhuvi is better than Shami although I think both should have played in the World Cup semi final,1
"Nice finish but our bowling needs to be great, because the avg first innings total is 207 in Sharjah :/",2
"Par score. Given its KXIP, I fully expect RCB to win by 35 runs",3
"Ok the reasons why ABD came late

1. They're playing against RCB-B team
2. They want to test their lower middle order
3. They don't want to over use ABD, he gets dehydrated fast and they have a match on Saturday afternoon.
4. ABD didn't take himself in his dream 11 team",13
in before morris and udana bat 4 and 5 next game,7
Will orange cap holder will open or go down in the middle,1
This is why we love t20. One freakin over and the game changed completely. That was a massive last over.,7
60-40 in rcb favour with that last over even 65_35,2
Very weird captaincy by Rahul. Arshdeep & Jordan still had 1-1 over remaining,1
How the fuck did they get 170,3
"KXIP: *bowls good*

KXIP: *realises they're bowling good*

KXIP: *starts bowling bad*",69
Pretty sure that Arshdeep would have given below 10 runs,3
Could have had 190 easily if we hadn't shit the bed,5
Morris has been in form since the World Cup.,7
NGL this is not an easy total to chase,6
Maybe this is why RCB experimented. Its KXIP.,7
Morris easily worth the full 10 crores. Gun fielder as well.,7
"Nortje has been a great find but if we didn't have him, I can't understand why we let Morris go. 

Morris, Rabada, Hetmyer, Stoinis

Impenetrable middle order",6
Mammad,2
Ahh boy and i thought morris was never gonna be worth the hype and cash,9
[removed],4
Can't believe Captains are still trusting Shami at death in Big 2020.,5
"A respectable score, thanks to late innings exploits by Morris.",7
Ok my big brain says it's a 200+ ground.,3
"If I hadn't seen the six losses KXIP had in this IPL, I would have said they have this in the bag. They will find a way to fuck this up",2
Morris is so cool.,6
Waiting to hear what Kohli’s master plan was,5
"I hope this is enough, but it should have been 200 if we used the right batting order.",3
So good to see the ritual of a meme team passing its bad luck to another team lol,2
I can’t count how many times KXIP throw winning positions away.,1
"Koach: I am gonna make the best losing strategy. 
KXIP: Hold our death bowling.",1
Barely par?,1
Seeing Morris hit those hits seems like the par score here was 220... We fucked up big time,9
What a blinder from Morris. He did this a few times for Delhi too. Handy guy.,10
You cant please r/cricket.. if KL had given last over to Arshdeep and he got taken for 24 in an over everyone would have winged why they didn't bowl Shami even though he got 2 wickets in his last over and only went for 4 lol..,20
"In my opinion, Sundar should be sent back. Dube should be sent in after AB and after Dube, Morris should come in.",6
"still below par score atleast 190 would have been decent here.  
But you never know with kxip",1
Ok AB you are batting below Morris and Udana now,12
"Who they sent before AB: Sundar

What we thought should've happened: AB coming in at 4

Who they should've sent before AB: Morris and udana",3
Now time to salivate at KXIP batting lineup,3
Well that's punjabs game gone now lol,2
absolute easy win for KXIP. I'd eat a bite of cricket ball if Punjab don't win.,13
"Chris Gayle: Considered the greatest six hitter in cricket by many

Also Chris Gayle: _0 Unacademy Cracking Sixes_",12
Morris and Udana playing better than the whole top order. Maybe Morris has to be sent ahead instead of Dube/Sundar,11
"Next game:  
Unkil Sunny: ""This man Morris scored 25 of just 8 balls in the last match. Koach should just get out next ball and let Morris come in.""",6
"All you need to know about Shami epitomised in those two overs, crazily different in quality.",3
KL is a not a good captain. Lots of poor decisions throughout this tournament,3
"People often ask me why you support RCB?

Me for this absolute madness! Lol",4
Shami must be the most sad man after taking the wickets of AB and Kohli in one over.,7
Dumb Question : Do broadcasters use different tech for video editing and playback ?how do they quickly put together the highlights ?,5
"29 runs short , otherwise it's fine",5
"Batting Order

Finch

Padikkal 

Koach

ABD

Morries 

Udana

Dube 

Sundar",5
"And like every game, Shami once again undoes his good bowling. Why is he sent to death bowling? He has failed again and again in this phase. Shami is a wicket taking bowler, and not a guy who can stop flow of runs. Captains need to understand this.",5
Shami might have lost them the game here i reckon,1
Murugan Ashwin didn't cheers that go well smfh,1
*phew* Thank God for Morris and Udana! much needed runs. Why the fuck did they sent ABD that late?,3
"Is this the worst KXIP has performed in any IPL ever? winning 1 out of 
 their first 7 matches?",1
[deleted],22
Shami taketh Shami giveth,7
Get Kohli and Ab out get destroyed by Morris. Just 2020 things,7
"I stilk think 185/190 is par here

Much better wicket than last game",2
With Morris batting like that rcb looks really strong,4
"KL, please score 80 (70) and increase your lead in the orange cap. It will be much appreciated.",4
"Sundar and Dube batted against the spinners. It was really difficult atthat time. I swear most of r/cricket is just dumb fucks, I am outta here.",5
I think this is a winning total. I think AB didn’t come in earlier because he was feeling sick. The pitch is slowing down. Second game in a row that most of the batsman have been struggling to h it,1
"Bangalore were still a bit short with the target though. They will have to bowl really well today especially with Punjab’s top order and the power of Maxi and Pooran further down. But then again, we said this when they faced KKR.",2
Only if devillers had come in earlier. Sigh!,8
Still I expect KXIP will just find a way to lose it anyway,6
Man KXIP I cannot,3
"Realistically though, I don't think Gayle will fire today ngl. It will take a while",11
Last over has put it back in RCBs favour imo,6
"Most fun least consistent



Kxip 🤝 Rcb",11
"Shami’s 20th over: Yorker ,into the body, Bouncer, Slower Ball, Full Toss.",4
RCB and KXIP are like 2 girls bitching that they are not looking good at a party and have gotten fat despite having above average looks (talent),5
"I’m not gonna blame Kohli for playing an anchor role, if he had not got out unluckily and successful accelerated as he usually does he could have ended w 60-70 at a SR of 140-150. My issue was that everyone around him was trying to play aj anchor role as well when that wasn’t what was needed. If Kohli scored 65 (45) and his partners score at a SR of 180+ RCB is easily at 190+",8
Can't wait for the Universal Boss,3
"Terrible bowling by Shami. He was just lucky to get a couple of big wickets. 

The worst part of Shami's bowling was that he was so casual and lacked any intensity.",0
Who have they benched instead of Gayle?,2
Gayle lbw Sundar.,5
"Shami has been, is and will remain trash at the death.
Hope Bumrah, Bhuvi and Saini make up our t20 bowling line up and leave Shami for Odi's & Tests.",3
Will the captain who doesn't believe in strike rate revisit his views? Find out after a short break!,3
"Shouldn't have gotten Virat ""Chhaka nahi marta mein gand fadke 2s bhagna h toh bol"" Kohli out",7
"Cant understand the logic behind sending Washington up the order, keeping AB in reserve. Morris' late assault has papered over this bad decision.",8
Gayle opens surely right?,2
[removed],5
Still remember when Morris single handedly almost won Delhi the match with around 80 from 30. [Scorecard](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/scorecard/980945/delhi-daredevils-vs-gujarat-lions-23rd-match-indian-premier-league-2016),7
"Some of you might not be able to digest the fact that barring the innings against CSK
 Kohli has been struggling this IPL. 

Pitch is definitely not as slow as he claims it to be.",-1
jeet jao please Kings 🙏,4
"Barring that last over, pretty great bowling overall",4
"Will the real RCB please stand up? I thought that Kings X1 are going to be the RCB this year. But the way last year's RCB is playing with holding back De villers, its confusing to see which team is going to be this year's RCB.",1
"Why do people think this is a bad score?? Yes it's sharjah but the pitch has changed anyone with even mild cricket knowledge knows how har it is to score on a slow, grippy pitch where the ball is turning quite a bit.",18
"Kxip and rcb trying their best to do an rcb, name a better duo",6
Looked no where near 170 with two fresh all rounders on strike. Somehow they smacked it better than any of the main batsmen this innings and got to 171. Only in T20.,5
"I am expecting the top order to crumble to something like 50-5 against Chahal and Sundar. With KL standing alone, we will rescue the chase and with one wicket left and two runs to chase with 4 balls remaining, he will get out trying to hit a six",10
"Again, Morris and Udana are both pace hitters and they were there when that was operating and delivered. Washi and Dube (for the most part) are the two lefties who are more of spin hitters and they operated during the leggies stint.

I'd thought ABD after Sundar, even after Dube would've worked, if Dube hadn't taken so long to get going",5
Morris giving that depth in batting and a strike bowler..what a player..,12
"The chasing team has a 100% loss rate in games I've watched, it's been seven or eight matches now I think. Doesn't bode well for KXIP",4
"Damn, Kings XI are so retarded for benching Gayle. 

They have a pretty scary batting line up 

Gayle
Rahul
Agarwal
Maxwell
Pooran",3
I've seen so many rcb advertisements today that whenever I look at the scorecard - I still feel like I'm looking at an advertisement,2
"RCB winning this one. Spinners were difficult to hit, Chahal and Sundae will be key.",9
"**RCB While defending below 175 target vs KXIP**

Won : 2

Lost : 7",14
Sundar and Chahal are going to end up with 5 wickets between them.,2
"Just started watching, why did AbD come so low?",3
"I don't really see the use of dube in the team. Sure he hit some runs here, but this is sarjah. If he isn't bowling then they should get a proper number 4/5 batsman in there.",7
"Nobody :                                                                                      

Rcb : WILDCARD BITCHES!!! YEEEEEHAAAWWW!",7
Can there be a keeper substitute?,6
I think it's a par score,3
Yikes...Shami’s an atrocious T20 bowler,1
RCB missed out on an easy 190 by sending Dube and Sundar,5
Can you all stop shitting on our management for not sending ab. We don't know what happened to him? Please stop ffs,12
"CMV. Other than the innings against chennai, koach's knocks have been pretty selfish.",-5
Koach's only goal today is to take Rahul's catch,18
"RCB have a good chance of defending this imo. Pitch is definitely slow, testament being Kohli's and Padikkal's dismissals. Sending out Sundar has justification, but not really for Dube. Oh well, Morris and Udana have given them quite a bit to bowl at anyway. Remember, RCB defended 169 vs KKR the other night.",8
"KP’s love for:

AB > VK > MS",7
Is AB injured or not well ?,3
"winning formula for RCB is +20 par score, this is gonna be tight bowlers need to do something or we are fucked",6
How does a fast bowler smile after being cunted for 24 by tail Enders ? Can only be his way of coping the shock,5
I have a feeling Gayle is going to murder Sundar today if he bowls in the powerplay,6
Inb4 ChaDar destroys KXIP today,2
"Either morris has played a masterclass

Or Rcb has fucked themselves thinking that this is a slow pitch",9
Why do I feel that Pooran will eat the RCB bowlers today? Not in a sexual way.,2
"We need to understand that what people are just shit posting on the match threads , most comments are for shits and giggles .You ain't gonna find cricket acedemia here.",1
Shivam Dube is one useless player. Not good enough to represent India.,3
"Rahul, Gayle, Agarwal, Pooran, Maxwell. With the firepower in that top order, and the ground being Sharjah, KXIP should chase this without much trouble. But again, They are the new RCB. Fingers crossed.",1
I know he got Kohli and AB out but Shami is a dream bowler for every half decent batsman in the last few overs,4
Murugan Ashwin with gun figures of 4-0-23-2,0
"Imo, the plan of sending Sundar and Dube before AB for the left-right partnership failed today. But it's okay to go for experiments at this stage, especially coz rcb are in a good position in the points table. Also, well played Morris. 170 is gonna be tough, especially when the ball is turning square.",6
Why is Australian tv promoting the US election like some UFC fight night ?,5
Why does KP look like he is sitting in an oven,1
"KP is leaving? Oh no, anyway...",3
Why they are showing highlight of last match and KL smashing us I don't want to see that xd,8
"Tuned in after powerplay, is this a par score?",2
Bye bye kp,2
"As an SRH, I feel now our time is coming. The pitch’s are slowing down and our spinners will have good opportunity to take more wickets.

Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey and Warner play spin well. So does Shankar and I have confidence in Garg.",11
"Shami supporters are always under the pump. One excellent over is followed by a really shabby one. 

we'll wait for Test matches, then.",7
"KXIP and fucking up at the end, name a better duo",6
"TODAY IS KP’s LAST DAY

🦀🦀KP IS GONE🦀🦀",8
Who else remembers that KP used to have pink hair early on in his career?,5
South Africa T20 WC winners,3
"T20 teams so often put themselves in bad positions by sticking to outdated standards and not understanding the game. If Morris and Udana are able to hit boundaries for fun like they did on this pitch, then why are the specialist batsmen playing selfish ""anchor"" innings instead of just accepting the inherent risk involved in this format and playing attacking cricket? 20(10) >>>>>> 48(39)",9
Lmao Dube and Sundar batted exactly 33 balls.,4
Ooo last day for KP (this year's IPL),3
"Harsha Bhogle: If it was the match-up of AB vs leg spin that caused him to come down at no 6, then Murugan Ashwin and Ravi Bishnoi must strut around for the rest of their cricket career, tell their relatives we were the reason the great AB didn't come out to bat!",20
Siraj's 4 overs are crucial for KXIP. They would want at least 40 from those,5
Inb4 ab specialist keeper batting at 8.,5
"I think washi is gonna get cunted today

Law of average gonna catch somewhere",12
i like how fans of both teams are mega skeptical about whos gonna win now lmao,21
"If Gayle fires tonight, it will be an opportunity for us to trash KXIP’s management 🤓",8
Neroli Meadows and KP's last day of chemistry 😅👍🏽,7
Even as an rcb fan I won't be too sad to watch Gayle winning single-handedly,10
Someone please tell me why abd batted at 6 or I'm gonna lose it,3
We are 15-20 runs short,0
Punjab missed a trick by not playing Mujeeb today,0
Preity can still get it,12
"Udana averages almost 20 in T20I’s, he is a really good batting option to have at 8.",5
"God Gaurav Kapur is so annoying in Cricbuzz Live. From what I've seen, he seems to be biased against RCB, and I've seen that in the Hindi show.

Gautam - Harsha - Joy is the best trio. I'd love to listen to a podcast by the three. They have just the perfect balance of calm and excitement, and are never over the top.

Gaurav Kapur in the show looks like he's trying so hard to make a joke in every sentence, it's just so irritating.

End rant.",8
Both rcb and kxip fans more confident in the choking ability of their own team is great to see,20
Why is KP leaving yo?,1
"this thread

RCB Fans: We gonna lose
KXIP Fans: No, we gonna lose",25
"Ab the specialist wk

Practising his drills",2
Shami bowls exactly the kind of length balls that Nehra keeps on talking about lol,4
"Wish KKR bought Chris Morris, instead of Pat Cummins. Morris is destructive, both with Bat & Bowl. RCB is lucky, that they lost Cummins and got Morris instead.",0
"Just one player seems to have brought better balance to this team in Morris. Imagine if they actually had a superior middle-order batsman, would have actually been confident of this RCB team.",10
KXIP should hold KL Rahul till 17th over to fuck with everyone similar to RCB,18
Teams that apply themselves well in the last 3 overs of an innings are obviously more successful (bowling & batting). KXIP struggle in both these areas and they lost matches precisely because of that,10
"Par score for Sharjah even with this pitch? No

Par score for KXIP? Yes",3
Just a reminder that the last innings in Sharjah while chasing were 120 and 130 odd,4
Most hilarious thing about that Dream XI ad is Hardik sitting in a library,18
"bowling for RCB is challenging, you gotta set the total you want to defend",3
"Last time an indian leg spinner said ""We can chase this down"" in the mid innings interview for RCB vs KXIP, we know what happened",4
If Morris had come in earlier. We were looking at 190. 171 is a joke on this pitch,-1
What's the thing about KP going on in this thread?,1
"RCB folks: You are gonna win this

KXIP fellas: No U",12
Lmao Gayle simply does not NOT open.,3
Why is Gayle not opening,2
I think RCB probably just wanted to test out the middle order in this match since they hadn't been getting very much exposure,5
Gayle at 3 after KL and Mayank take care of the swing,4
Wanted Gayle to open.,2
Gurkeerat must be sad seeing Sundar and Dube getting chance to play before AB,4
Dafuq why is Gayle not opening? Surely you'd want him in the powerplay!,2
Imagine not opening with Gayle,1
Looks like even KL is inspired by DK's school of random batting order generator,5
Gayle at 3 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃,7
KXIP are carrying out blasphemy here,5
I think Rahul can compete with Kohli for shitty captainship,5

"Retarded to not open with Gayle. Rahul and Agarwal have been great, sure, but they have won you one game. ONE. GAME. And that was a game in which the opening partnership sucked.",3
"U Dumb Fucks, if Gayle plays, he’s the opener by default. IDC how good the other openers are",10
One over literally changed the game - this is why I love the t20 format,2
No Gayle wtf?,3
"Gayle at 3?

Interesting to say the least",1
Let me guess. They are saving Gayle for #6.,9
who's the universe daddy?,3
"People playing Dream11: Has AB as their captain

Koach: Not today",4
It took Dhawan one innings to realize he fucked up with the steike rate. KL Rahul has had half the tournament already lol.,4
Why the fook they not send the universe BOSS? Wot da fuq?,5
"Wait no way, this is a joke right",4
36 off 33 for Sundar and Dube....ABD would've gotten 55 minimum.,2
Klpd> gayle,1
"171 kinda above per, pitch is much slower then those 400+ matches",1
Oh come on. KL could have come in at 3 and made way for Gayle at the top. Gayle is not going to rotate strike to be in the middle overs. KL and Mayank can do that better.,5
The fuck lmao. Gayle at no 3? And i thought rcb's tactic was bad,9
So middle order consisting of Gayle Maxwell Pooran man that's a lot of destruction,11
"Rcb: we'll lose 



Kxip: le Mera praa",11
KL Rahul 60(50) incoming,5
Has Gayle ever not opened?,3
Just a daily reminder than Kamran Akmal has won more IPLs than Virat Kohli,18
"r/cricket: Ab at 6 was one of the worst decisions.

KXIP: *Hold my gayle*.",19
Ooh lol xd,1
"RCB : we're giving you a win here

KXIP : no u",7
Bro get fucked we don't deserve to win,8
"RCB, KXIP trying outdo each other tactically",2
"This is so not entertaining, why not gayle?",3
What ground is this? Sharjah?,1
"Gayle to bat at 5? KL and Koach be like “Anything you can do, I can do better” when it comes to big brain captaincy moves.",10
"I like that they're not adjusting to Gayle. KL and Mayank have good chemistry, don't ruin it.",1
"Fam, bring out the Universe Boss. You can't contain him for this long.",4
Anyone happen to look at the live chat on the Hotstar app? It’s basically pure cancer.,6
"Gayle not opening!

What even is management!",4
"Kings XI is royally fucked guys. If you don't open with Gayle, you don't understand the game. KL should have come at 3 but he valued his orange cap more than the team",9
"One team holding Ab back

Other holding gayle back

Both team management gonna get trolled mercilessly for few days now",25
Lol. Gayle at 3?,4
absolutely dombfock decision to not send Gayle in PP,4
"Good Lord, why do we have Lord Siraj in the squad today as well?",3
Why did ABD come in so late?,2
I don't have any expectations from Gayle today. Even if he does 20 from 10 that would be exceeding expectations.,7
Want to see Gayle running singles batting in the middle order,8
Gayle during middle overs? Interesting,2
"AB at 6


Gayle not opening 


Yup this is just two teams trolling each other",11
One of these should get a duck just for the lolz,1
Who is ready to hop onto KL's tuk tuk ride?,2
Scenes if Gayle comes at 4 and plays a run a ball /dont kill me,5
Chris Gayle in the KXIP team as a finisher,6
Ok punjab takes the stupid decision of the day award,2
"KP taking a dig at Koach: You dont want to fix something that aint broke (on KL-Mayank opening partnership).

I agree, why disturb something that works.",9
"Team changes for RCB  in my opinion


 Gurkeerat > Dube

Moeen > Finch

Parthiv(wk opener) > Siraj(don't need 6th bowler + have Moeen)


There you have it a good middle order",3
"Kumble and KL showing their masterclass in planning every moment - dropped M Ashwin all this while for no reason. Imagine if he had been there in the team when their bowlers couldn't take a wicket for 35+ overs. 

And now bring Gayle in, only to play him in 3. Yeah, that's totally going to work out.",2
The way I look at it they should've sent Gayle to open. If he gets out that's okay because Rahul and Mayank have been great for them anyway. Gayle at 3 just doesn't seem right.,5
How did KL go from that century against RCB to saying strike rate is overrated and playing slow?,5
"Gayle not opening?

Thats just not cricket.",8
Why don’t they give an orange helmet?,4
Hoping to see RCB continue with correct bowling decisions.,2
Thala Rahul to anchor with a solid 55(50),5
Gayle should have come out to Open.,3
This match will go down in the history of IPL as the most shittiest batting order by both the teams,22
Gayle didn't come in and now they missed three sixes off three balls. Oh noes!,14
AB needs protection from Leg Spin. Looks like Gayle needs protection from Swing. Really great decision making by their team managements to ease these youngsters into the side. Hopefully they make it big some day.,8
"Why would you want to disturb the one thing kxip have had going for them this season lol? Their opening partnerships have been amazing, no need to change it up",1
Gayle not opening is like Lona Rhodes not opening,7
Tf is Gayle? Stop being innovative for the sake of being innovative,2
"You know what would be peak 2020? All the pitches slow down so much they end up similar to Chepauk dustbowls, CSK charge through the table choking every team with spin, makes it into the playoffs and wins the IPL.",15
Imagine Gayle held back till 15th over,6
why is gayle not opening lmao,6
"Since AB is keeping, it purely was a tactical decision, no?",2
When did Morris get so good? Last year he was bowling absolute pies for DC.,5
I actually tuned in to watch Gayle and all I saw was KL Disappointment,5
how often has gayle not opened. wonder how he'll do without time to settle in,4
KL on top while playing some selfish innings is the biggest meme,3
Has gayle ever not opened in a t20?,9
Decisions like not opening with Gayle is why KXIP is at the bottom.,10
Why the fuck was Gayle not chosen to open by KXIP,5
"Gayle and KL opening in 2018 was absolutely OP. Damn, I really wanted to see that.",13
Rahul will play enough Tuk Tuk and ensure he retains orange cap so that Gayle can save the team at the end.,1
Chris Gayle not opening is like Sehwag playing the finisher lol,11
"Who has bigger PP?
RCB bringing in ABD at number 6 or KXIP for not allowing Gayle to open?",14
[deleted],17
Who did Gayle replace ?,1
Moris bowled so beautifully,5
Gayle at 3 will flop. He either opens the innings or doesn't play.,8
Morris the chad lad,2
[deleted],6
Punjab trumping the brain (dead) games by demoting Gayle,4
"Even KXIP fans would want KL to get out, Gayle and Mayank is an excellent and explosive partnership",3
Kp saying gayle won't be nervous..what bs,-1
"This ground is so tiny that Gayle's mishit will still go for a maximum and even maybe out of the stadium. I cannot imagine what will happen if he absolutely middles and smacks one hard, it'd end up a lot more further than the road outside.",10
Commentators saying Gayle will be nervous? Are they high?,17
Chris Gayle doesn't even know the meaning of nervous,7
"Rajasthan opening with finishers, Punjab not opening with t20 opening legend. Kohli sending dube, sundar ahead of abd. This ipl has it all.",8
why does this batting lineup look so decent for punjab,1
Morris gonna end up with an ESPN impact score of 420.69 in this match,10
So both are still playing for the cap,2
Yeah so Morris going to destroy us all on his own,9
Gayle is my favourite universe boss,1
Atm Morris seems to be the best allrounder of the ipl,5
When was the last time Gayle didn't open? Never?,4
"Gayle not opening, this match is like a weird performance art competition to see which team can make more idiotic decisions. Rahul truly is Kohli's perfect successor",6
What's the general opinion? Will the pitch slow down?,-1
Deano's demo zone😭😔😔,4
"I think I can guess why ABD came down late. When given keeping, ABD must've said - I can either keep or bat longer, not both. So RCB chose to have ABD keep and then have him bat for 4-5 overs only. Maybe it'll change if they go to playoffs.",5
Need to bowl out Siraj's 4 overs before Gayle comes to bat or we're fucked,2
"On one hand, I know that sending AB at 6 was a shit decision on the other I want youngsters to get more opportunities",1
Scenes if Deepak Hooda walks in at 3,5
What kind of a player keeps for his IPL team but not his nation? (Looking at you AB) *(Shame)*,2
I think ABD batted lower because he has to keep for 20 overs in the heat and also cause RCB wanted some batting time for Washi and Dube.,4
Orange cap innings™,13
Talk about messing up the batting order,4
Tbh I think Mayank and Gayle should have opened. KL can play anywhere,12
Mayank making it look like a red ball,3
"Chris Gayle has a test triple hundred, odi double hundred, and T20 hundred.

Players like Dhoni can’t hold a candle to him, but are legends in India because they captained competitions that the team won.

I absolutely hate it no matter what anyone says.",3
"Everyone : You guys need to bring Gayle back in


7 games later


KXIP : Yup we need someone to come steady the ship after a few quick wickets",3
"All the ads on hotstar are what we call, Jaatre in Karnataka..",2
30 runs short this with the sexy KXIP batting power they have,3
damn punjab is just csk but they don’t have the excuse of being old,3
Relax guys..they are gonna take it deeeep for gayle to finish it,5
Someone hit the pause button on Murali Karthik.,3
Will yuzi chahal debut on this australia tour?,1
Shit ball after an over of beautiful bowling,2
Why is Gayle playing if he isn't opening?,3
This is the perfect ground for the Universe Boss to begin his journey this season. He can definitely smack easy sixes here without even trying.,2
"When Gayle bats, commentators are nervous.",1
"One of the opener gonna get out soon, then Gayle gonna get trapped by sundar .. shitty decision gives shitty results",2
Gayle is a tailender now?,5
"7 balls one run what a joke, get fucked both of you",6
"RCB will lose if I watch their bowling, so ima stay put.",8
Don't think I've ever seen a first over without slip,8
What so you guys think of Rahul and Mayank opening together for india across formats?,7
Morris as good as stokes in this format,10
Can’t imagine Gayle not opening. I guess there is a first for everything,13
"What is with a retarded decision by every team this season? :

MI- sending Hardik over Pollard in the middle overs

CSK- just everything

RR- Stokes opening and Uthappa at 5

RCB - AB at 6

KKR - Morgan not at 4

KXIP- Gayle not opening

SRH- Kane not at 3

DC- Carey not in the top order",30
"Anyone else feel like KL Rahul is kind of greedy for the orange cap now? He can bat anywhere, and should have sent out Chris Gayle to open.",9
Saini is just Sai baba of Northern India,8
KL what the fk ?????????????????????????????????????You couldn't come at no.3 you fkin orange cap wearing rahul gandhi🤦,11
That sound of timber 😍,2
This would be a Siraj classic.,2
"And I thought RCB management are clowns for holding back AbD!!

KXIP outdid them by playing Gayle in middle order.",7
Gayle is in just for morale,8
Holy shit that fielding.,4
Epic save by VK,2
"I will tell everyone why Gayle didn't open

&#x200B;

Its Sharjah bro. and they do not want small kids on the road to get hurt. Same with RCB's ABD too. I will not be surprised if gayle came at no.5 or 6. These two are the only batsman capable of hitting kids on roads

*that was lame but good*.",11

"Lol imagine gayle walking out in the 15th over with the pitch slowing down and the ball turning 

IMAGINE",16
Imagine scoring 1 off the first over after putting Gayle at 3,23
Gayle will bat after Deepak Hooda and Murugan Ashwin.,12
Very tight bowling,5
Rcb bowling relatively tight is a pleasant surprise every time.,10
They need to hit,3
KL true game changer. Takes the game and gives it to the opponent.,6
"Eh. Did he say Chris Gayle is nervous?

Ahh yes. I'll have 2 of whatever it is you're taking Mark Nicholas.",11
Is Mandy really injured?,3
"Why are you guys criticising RCB and KXIP? Its just for memes, man.",7
These clowns man. Fuck off. Useless Rahul,9
Lol imagine imagining,10
"Koach is a bit jealous of ABD, methinks...",5
Maybe Gayle going to play for the next 5-6 years as a Pollardesque middle order player. I am here for it.,8
Rahul & Kohli probably still thinking they are bantering on Insta.,10
They're batting like they've forgotten Umesh isn't playing,7
"No 6 conceded yet?

It's our day bois",-2
This sub is one giant cesspool of unsolicited expert analysis. All of a sudden you want to replace the best opening pair in this tournament just because Gayle is playing?,11
"I have this feeling that rahul took gayle just because he was forced to, gayle not opening is weird and i don't see any good reason behind it.",7
No matter where yu are positioned to field.. yu'll always have siraj to give you hi-fi you,10
Sunil Narine as Floater - 5% of Brain's Potential                              Chris Gayle as Floater- 69% of Brain's Potential,6
Either KXIP management is braindead or Rahul is,7
Gayle at no. 5 ?,3
"If this sentence fucks with your mind, it's because it's ridiculous, true and false all at the same time: Gayle playing as a specialist slip fielder today.",8
"Rahul you cunt, I'm fucking done with you man",2
I am counting on Siraj,3
Inb4 these two tuktuk their way through the entire innings and we don't even get to see Gayle,8
I would take this opportunity to congratulate Team India to make it into the finals of the champions trophy 2017 with Koach - Kumble duo at the helm of the decision making.,3
"Why the fuck have you taken Gayle if you are not making him open. The first few overs in the second inning are most suited for his assault. 

Who the fuck is in charge of thinking in that dugout. That person needs to have a lobotomy.",9
"Saini should be a regular in Indian ODI, t20 and test side",2
This is pretty selfish stuff if Rahul opened in place of Gayle. If he doesn't trust his middle order he should do what Rohit did a couple seasons ago and go into the middle order. Gayle would've made good use of the field restrictions. The man won't run much once the field is spread out,6
KL Rahul is a kda player.,2
how come morris has played only 23 t20i for saffa  but 64 ipl matches .how is that even possible?,2
You guys are all super over hyping Gayle. He hasn't played in a long time and even before that he wasn't in a good form,5
The biggest difference for RCB this year has been Chris Morris and the lack of Umesh!,5
I believe KL would play big against big bro Kohli again,2
"Last time 2 players from a team fought for the orange cap, it was kkr in 2014 and they went on to win 9 consecutive games. Also the longest winning streak in T20s",5
What is that watch that Virat and Morris are wearing?,2
someone get the pornhub theme song playing bc they are taking it DEEEEEEEEP,5
Morris has a 82 off 32 in ipl,5
Sending Gayle at 3 is worse than pushing Abd at 6,6
Maxwell and gayle should have opened. They are useless down the order.,5
If you're going to come in ahead of Gayle in the powerplay the least you could do is show some *I N T E N T.*,9

Slow enough first 2 overs that 172 is suddenly much more competitive,4
Universe boss - what’s wrong with this Universe?,7
"As much as I love seeing Gayle play, it does not make sense to break up the partnership KL and Mayank have",8
"rahul is scared if mayank beats him in orange cap race.  
You get gayle for this match and sent him one down in shj , no letting him play PP is beyond insane

imagine these two scoring  only 6 runs in 2 over in PP",8
Kl is a joke man. If he doesn't have a 200 strike rate today fuck him,3
I gave KL Rahul benefit of the doubt. But he is a shizz captain,5
Lord Siraj doing his thing,3
"Siraj doing Siraj things, XD",4
Siraj has still got it.,3
I love this batting combo.,2
Siraj - **high five**,5

Who were those people? And thaat RR LADY?😍😍,2
Rcb : its a prank bruv,5
I think they will send maxi next lol,8
dude score some six or something just do something,1
That was wide,2
"
One team has the dude with most man of the match awards in ipl and he is allowed to bat until the 16th over. 

Other team has the dude with second most man of the match awards and he is not allowed to open.",19
Blue balls going away _( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),1
"If ABD was Indian, the Modi govt would have started a CBI investigation on why he came out to bat at 6. No way that is a tactic, that’s just shady.",2
"People here abusing KL because they didn't get to see their favourite player open. Lol. It could easily be Kumble's decision, or even more possible, decision of both openers + Kumble. It's not as simple as ""I want orange cap, so I will keep opening"".",11
Saini gave up a little too early?,3
"Imagine somehow miraculously KXIP qualify for playoff. And later imagine if RCB and KXIP face each other in the final? Honestly I don’t want to see them playing against each other. But if they do face each other in the final, I can see the fans pulling out a “Gracias Gayle, Mayank, KL, Jordan...” banner. KXIP and RCB holding hands together and jumping with joy after the final!",5
K.L. Rahul six in powerplay? Just RCB things... :D,4
Yeah RCB fucked up nothing new,3
Finally this moron hits,2
When will sundar bowl?,4
KLPD SR >100,5
"Maxi and Gayle, if fired against Siraj, RCB stands no chance",9
Umpiring has been good in this tournament? Wut ... KP be professional and don't do lines on air.,3
"Say whatever you want about KL


But his shots are glorious to watch",3
"Can anybody explain why ABD came in late?

Did commentators mention something?",1
Ruined his strike rate with that six.,2
It could actually be a Kumble decision to not open with Gayle. Same with sending Prabhsimran over Maxwell last match.,2
"Rahul angry, be ready RCB for a quickfire 75(62)",7
damn kxip could easily be top 4 with this squad if maxwell was in form,2
"Chahal in the pp, what?",3
Takatak is such a ripoff they're not even trying to hid it,2
Gayle at 3 is not nearly as bad as AB at 6 lol,4
What is the full form of KLPD?,4
"Gayle- I am gonna castrate every single bowler's balls...

KL and kumble trio--chill boss we you gonna take their balls DEEEEEEEEP",2
"Sundar: Bowls like a god in the powerplay  
Chahal: Bowls like a god in the middle overs  
Kohli: Bowls Chahal in the powerplay  


  
Ok.",12
"Bro wtf happened to Rahul mindset man, I remember last ipl or the one before that he would literally annihilate the opposition in powerplay.",3
Rcb really fucking changing the script.,5
The pitch will get slower. Pair that with the fact that Chahal and Sundar are in the form of their life Punjab needed to make the best of the PP. Now they're crawling at 6 rpo. If you make shit decisions you deserve to languish at the bottom of the table,10
Why chahal in the powerplay? Last time he did this it did not go well,3
"Chahal in PP, Before Sundar?",2
Fuckin smoke these peasants KL LESGOOOO,5
sundar would bowl out before gayle comes to bat,2
"i think today, captains are trying to troll us with their decisions but ofc they are backfiring 💪",5
"With all the frustration going around, let's review our expectations:

RCB vs RCBv2.0",7
Chahal and Sundar switched positions because of the left hand hitters imo.,8
Hope kxip win by 10 wickets just to see this sub in uproar,10
brett lee speaking hindi out of nowhere throws me off lol,12
Rahul 400 runs completed this season,9

RCB bowling chahal so Gayle doesn't play him lmao,7
Chahal has set the trap. Take a single or block the next ball.,4

Chahal in PP and not Sundar? Koach is really experimenting a lot today.,18
Punjab girl😍😍😅,3
Could have just bowled Sundar ffs,2

That's how good players of spin play. So elegant !,1
Kya chatuk chahal Punjab ka agarWALL tod payega,5
why would chahl bowl when sundar bowled so well in PP so far.,5
Man Mayank is so good,6
Inflate-deflate strategy.,10
"Noice, Mayank",6
"Murali Kartik during the post match interview after the KKR RCB match, said something on the lines of ""even you found it hard to play on this pitch and ABD came in and played like he was on another pitch"". I think we saw the effect of those words today...",5

This is not good for us.....,7
Get fucked chokers,4

Yeah why the fuck is chahal in when Washington has been delivering? I just can't with this fucking shit,4
Chahal gave more run than last match,3
Mayank better than Rahul,3
What is this incredible tactic of hitting sixes at Sharjah?,11
Dumb fucking captaincy from Koach. He's gonna miss this over in half an hour.,2
"Nice kohli, nice. Just superb captaincy. This is why we haven't won a cup and we ain't winning one either.",5
Mayank is the batsman whose time has come. Give this guy a go in the ODIs too.,2
Who is that Cred AD girl?,2
[removed],3
KXIP honestly have nothing to lose.. they should just play freely and create some upsets in their remaining games.,2
Gayle was a substitute fielder all along. We just didn't know.,2
That was good stuff from Mayank. He has been a revelation this IPL,1
"Imagine Chris Gayle vs RCB but it’s an anime. Udana runs in to bowl and a flash back starts of RCB promising Chris Gayle he will be retained, while the management sit in a  dark room and discuss dumping him. He is eventually dumped and this causes him to lose an year getting dependent on drugs. Finally a training montage where he is smacking sixes with a single stump, even whilst his hands bleed.  Flash back ends with the noise of a loud bang off the bat and it’s six. Flash back of Udana being bullied as a kid for bowling badly starts",9
"Yall are wayy too reactionary. KXIP have literally failed at everything this season.. except these 2 and their opening partnerships. 

Yes it's weird as fuck seeing Gayle not open, but did you really expect KXIP to fix the ONE thing that wasn't broken?!",10
"THIS IS INTENT, MOFOS!!! K.L. Rahul needs to learn.",0
Can’t say I didn’t see that coming. Smh,2

Imagine blaming the only dude who is scoring consistently and at a 135 strike rate. Any team would be lucky to have him.",7
RCB will be the reason for Punjab's resurgence.,4
KL heard all of you,4
Vietnam Flash backs to last game,2
"To all RCB fans, keep calm and trust in Kings XI batting line up.",2
Koach has a history of keeping his team unsettled for long periods thru selection and other changes.. he's pulled those shenanigans with India too..,6
Mayank’s orthodox shots v spin = serotonin,5
I don't like this Rahul fan chant. It just hurts my ears.,4
Archer MVP by a mile on that chart lmao,6
"Gayle has batted as a non opener in

20 ODIs

9 Tests

2 IPL matches

0 T20Is

31 times in 654 innings (couldn't find data on other leagues)",9
"Mf DJ using the same Rahul Rahul chants for KL, Tewatia and Triphathi",7
Prity is pretty ngl😮,5
Gayle would have been out 2 times by now lol,5
RCB made the KXIP bowling look like the best bowling unit of the tournament for 19 overs because they played too cautiously.,3
jofra archer most valuable player so far? well well well,7
Looks like this is RCB's match to experiment. Are they prematurely over-confident to make it to the play-offs?,2
RCB had many strategies going into the game and they decided to chose the one which was fuck all lmao,5
Wtf is this bc,1
I missed first innings but cam someone tell me what happened with ABD today? The scoreboard makes absolutely no sense.,2
"If Mayank stays through, he's gonna murder Washington",4
"RCB trying to be too clever in this game, sending Washington up the order ahead of AB and Morris, and now not bowling him in the powerplay where he's done so well.",6
"After this match... 

RCB NRR ko Vanakkam",4
I feel like KXIP going forward are going to play these 11.. so we will def see Gayle in the next match if not this one lol,1
RCB destroying hopes. A familiar feeling.,3
"De Villiers : I did not ""come behind"" Kohli coz that's gay",7
Gayle not opening is like Rahul scoring runs for winning,4
"Agarwal: Fine, I will do It myself",1
"KL, can you run Mayank out since he is a threat to your orange cap? It will be much appreciated.",7
giving 2 wins for kxip is just rcb things,7
Easily not out lol,5
He is in.,3
Oh thank god he’s safe.,3
Reckon hes in,5
[removed],11
"Good to see them utilising the powerplay, gonna help them massively in the death if RRR is 7/8. But then they are KXIP after all..",5
[Kohli when he sees that you're allowed to hit length balls in the air before the 17th over.](https://media1.tenor.com/images/ecf6b227c1d9de64384b5d7897762a84/tenor.gif?itemid=15213145),1
Fuck off. No way we are losing to Memes XI.,4
Kohli is such a weird captain,2
"These two be like, 

Universe Boss who?",3
Archer is such a good name to a fast bowler. So is Boult. The accuracy of an Archer and the speed of a lightning bolt,12
Why did Chahal bowl ahead of Washington? Two right handers?,3
He is safe. But that was unnecessary.,1
That doesn't seem tight wtf. Easily easily visible that it isn't out,2
Sunny G with his usual chutiyapa,3
"This fat mofo was literally standing in front, couldn’t give a decision?",7
g..a..y..I..e,2
That Punjab girl waving the flag is so cute😍😍❤️😅😅👍🏽,11
Direct Hits Everywhere,6
The Rahul and RCB chant making my ears bleed wtf is that,6
SunnyG decided he’s going to talk to slow motion player reactions today,4
Mark Nicholas is so awfully sarcastic and condescending LOL,7
RCB will miss a direct hit only when the batsmen are short,17
"man, so many inside edges when they are trying the cut shot",2
true story but gayle always opens cos he's too chill and falls asleep if he has to wait too long he's probably snoring now,7
They need to hit the stump before the batsman gets into the crease. /s,4
Umpire in this over: abey BC,6
They're breaking stumps so often I hope they don't fall off just from the breeze after a while,3
"Ball touches bat 



KL Mayank : animeRunning.exe",2
That stump is taking a beating,2
Guess ill go to bed then,2
This running must be infuriating for kohli,5
lmao RCB and their fans forgot their Meme roots after a pretty decent season so far.,11
RCB trying hard to lose,4
Get lord Udana in for these noobs,6
"Theodore Roosevelt had a saying, ' If you could kick in the pants the person responsible for most of your troubles, you wouldn't sit for a week.' Seems like he had a premonition of RCB when he said it.",4
Mayank our third LOI opener now? Ahead of Dhawan?,4
At least the throwing is accurate,6
Yes they'll only hit stumps while fielding now.,8
Classic Gavaskarism,7
"Lol Sunny busy shitting on the running, See's the replay and instantly shuts up",10
See Finchy? You don't needa keep running at the bowler to hit boundaries,3
[deleted],13
We're losing this one aren't we,6
"RCB made batting here look impossible, twice",9
Mayank and Rahul are such a treat to watch.,5
Kxip will be 170/0 in 19 overs and then lose it,40
Hate them all you want.. but both KL and Mayank are on another level this IPL,11
KXiP players have to do double shifts so they get tired easily,2
And Gayle takes a drip & sleeps in the dugout,6
"**Mayank Agarwal scoring rate vs different spin bowling types in IPL since 2017**

Left-arm wrist spin - 6.85

Off-spin - 9.14

Slow left arm - 9.85

Mystery spin - 10.13

Leg-spin - 9.88

*Cricviz*",10
Mayank looks like the basic character from a video game.,4
I hope they're just experimenting to see what the outcome is if their best batsman and the best PP bowler don't perform well. Otherwise this is just pathetic.,4
Get sundar now pls,4
[deleted],8
Where's Washi?,2
Is RCB trying too hard in this match? Everything seems forced and desperate.,3
ABD at 6. Sundar not yet in. Seems Koach back to RCB form.,3
Umpire getting his workout done with all the direct hits,3
"Stump: exists

RCB fielders: let's kill it",6
Remember when Mayank and Rahul played like shit for RCB?,9
Why no Sundar in PP?,3
"to all those KXIP fans that were losing their shit after the first 2 overs, SEE ? CALM DOWN this isnt a super over",6
"Saini continuing RCB bowler's ""Spray and Pray"" legacy",8
"1) Rohit 2) Mayank 3) Virat 4) KL in limited overs, thoughts?",7
Can you imagine being in a hotel in Mumbai for 3 months as a foreigner doing dugout commentary. That too remotely not from the ground. Has to suck. ESP without family,4
"while this is a good start for kxip, this pitch slows down a lot near the end so they need to be careful with their wickets",2
Why isn't pavan negi getting a game?,1
"Say what yall want about gayle not coming in for opening, these two always give kxip a solid start",2
I feel a lot of RCB’s success can be attributed to their bowling options. Having more options gives you a freer hand.,3
Abd be like tumse na ho payega,4
"Still thinking 170 is par here

Only kxip can beat kxip now",4
"so, why is the PP specialist Sundar who has been bowling so well not bowling in PP when we really need a wicket?",7
Gayle is going to murder siraj. Koach should bowl him out asap,8
mcbc,2
I bet KL and Mayank opening is causing all kind of headaches for Indian selectors lol,6
Where is washi,6
Virat let Sundar bat so now he won't let him bowl,7
Udana is just a better version of Unadkat.,5
Hope Siraj can pull through.,3
"Just bizzare, why mess with something thats working? Sundar has been amazing in the powerplay yet Chahal bowls ahead of him",6
"KXIP against every other team: please let us win


KXIP against RCB: bitch, what you say?",17
[deleted],10
What is udana's role in this side. Hardly gets to bat or bowl. Wouldn't it be better if moen plays?,4
"RCB: Literally has the best powerplay bowler in the IPL

Also RCB: Doesn’t bowl him in the powerplay.",19
"What do you think women must be enjoying more ?

Being married to a FINGER spinner or being married to a WRIST spinner ?",5
High five siraj is there for you,3
KXIP making sure Chris Gayle milk quick singles in middle overs facing Sundar.,10
"When I hoped Kohli would one up KL, I meant it batting wise, not captaincy wise

Jk we'll have to wait and see, but it's def not working so far whatever VK is thinking of doing",4
Siraj's only contribution in this match is to give a high five to every other player,24
Lmao our NRR will be back in the gutter.,16
"Udana: thank you, ass",2
Lmao Siraj running and hifying people who fielded well when he's absolute crap himself,16
5 more minutes before everyone starts speculating if Washington Sundar is sick.,18
KXIP will finish this season with 2 wins against RCB :),20
400IQ move by Koach to promote Washington in the batting order and demote him in the bowling order,22
"Swann: looks at his stats

Swann: I don't really believe in stats",6
"Man, Mayank is OP this season.",6
"What a shot, clean hit. Love watching Mayank hitting sixes",10
Mayank n KL living my childhood dream of playing cricket with my best friend,18
Why does Siraj look like an anime character?,3
"Slower balls are supposed to be a surprise, not every ball lmao",7
"Why is RCB dead set on losing against KXIP, does Rahul has Kohli's nudes😉",7
Ohhh Yeahhhh1!! daddyy mayank go daddy goooo!! SHOT,6
So RCB read the pitch all wrong and Kohli had no timing,7
way these two are playing im baffled at how rcb played the middle overs,4
What ground is this?,2
Cut to kohli/dube/sundar taping the ball into a gap for some nice singles.,6
"Wow looks like the pitch is much better now

/s",3
"Even after getting thunderous start, You know what ? 


We're capable of bottling this too :)",7
Everybody bowled in the PP except dhobington,3
Mayank has to play for India,4
Why isn't Sundar not bowling?,2
"Kohli has only himself to blame for screwing up RCB batting order. They could have set a target of 190+, instead dube ne duba diya.",6
hands down mayank is kxips best batsman,5
I’ve lost hope for Rcb winning this match today and my day is already fucked. Atleast if Gayle bats it’ll become a bit better,4
"Why isn't Sundar bowling in power play? 

Koaaaaachhhh...",2
"Calling it boys 

Koach sacrificing matches against KXIP for Play-Offs",4
"Commentators talking about run rate, not realizing KXIP squad is batting with only 5 wickets in hand and not a full 10.

These two fall and they will already be 7 down.",3
I'm so conflicted watching these two bat. I want them to smash RCB to bits but want RCB to win.,3
This is why you don't bring in Gayle!,2
this is how you should be playing in Sharjah,3
Swann just before ump announced the timeout is gold lmao.,3
Do you guys think this timeout is a good idea? I swear it always kills the momentum of one team.,3
As someone said earlier...RCB is RCB's biggest enemy,3
RCB were at the same score right?,2
KXIP epitomizes “its the hope that kills you!”,7
"Kxip today has :



Desi Gayle 


Mini Gayle 


Gayle 


In their lineup",3
"sometimes I think this ""pitch slowing down"" or  ""dew came into play"" are all just lies",7
"Gayle eyeing the orange cap to win it for the 3rd time

KL: Aap Dream 11 mein team banao yeh meh kar leta hu",6
Are Punjab batting on a different track?,7
damn i really want to see mayank open w rohit,1
A fast bowler can never be a good coach. Kumble proves this point,5
Hate how RCB fans here keep bitching about how a certain player didn’t play as well with them...says more about RCB than the players.,5
Now this is more like the rcb I know. Hopelessness and sadness in knowing that the match is already lost:),7
"If Mayank isn't in India vs Aus T20 squad, we riot",10
"First 6 overs 

Rcb : 57/1

Kxip : 56/0",9
Swann is the most entertaining commentator across all commentators,4
The only reason udana hasn't been dropped yet is because the srilankans will reply with nagin dance.,4
Rcb and kkr losing today and tomorrow will open up the tournament,7
I don't know who's currently opening for India but it's clear that it should be this duo.,2
What's up with Kohli's captaincy today?,1
Ok Finch has to go. He’s not giving RCB good starts. And Kohli has to start hitting,4
Mayank so deserves the orange cap.,3
"Are the umpires required to wear a watch just to signal the ""strategic"" timeout?",6

"Six and a single, Rohan get the tissues because I just came",9
"With the the exception of that 20th over, this game has been going one way since the decision to hold AB back.",5
"Pitch doesn't seem as unfavorable as RCB batsmen made it look, sure KL and Mayank were slow to start but they're looking well set and batting fluidly now",5
Wtf is wrong with RCB they didn't give Washi the bowl even though he has been bowling brilliantly in the power play. Shit tactics.,9
"In our heads, we've already fixed our strike rate",1
"I'm watching this match. Every rcb match I've watched, they've lost",2
Mayank was hitting sixes while needing to use the washroom lol,3
Rohit Sharma has amazing comic timing he's the best of the cricketers doing ads although for me Hardik is a close second..,11
"Without MSD, I am worried how Koach is going to captain India. Bewada is not going to talk up to Koach nor come out with any good strategy.",0
Threads really go from thrashing players to making them GOAT in no time,2
"The power plays have been very similar so I guess we're going to see if it really was that hard to bat through middle overs, or whether Kohli just shit the bed.",1
Heard that the girl in Bumrah Dream XI ad is 31 yrs old. Is it true??,4
"No matter how good Rahul and Mayank are at opening,it’s criminal to make Gayle bat at 3.",4
"Best batsman doesnt get to bat

Best pp bowler doesnt bowl in pp

Kohli kaka overthinking...,1
If rcb has to lose anyway atleast it's to these guys,4
"I think matchups are overrated. You don't save your powerplay specialist only against a particular batsmen. ( Sundar for Gayle).

There are 4 overs, no harm bowling 1 or 2 where he bowls well...",2
Can the developer please release an update patch and nerf Mayank? too OP mayne,2
[removed],5
Why has Indian Twitter not taken offensive to Swann's over the top blatantly sarcastic commentary? It's hilarious and cringy but perfect fodder for twitterati,5
How many more runs till broadcasters get enough reactions to make VK disappointed face montage.?,4
Reminder that AB is an equal shit captain to Kohli. AB bowled 3 overs in their semi loss to NZ in 2015,1
"Kohli does not trust Sundar in PP (@ Sharjah) but bowls Chalal, who flights the ball, in PP instead? Wow. Koach is an idiot.",5

"Mayank is quite good in Tests and T20s.  


He's quickly becoming an great choice for an all format opener.",10
"Ok here i said it, kohli has looked pretty weak hitting boundaries this year.",2
Did anyone explain the ABD debacle yet?,3
Is there ever a situation in IPL when Mayank played 2nd fiddle to KL,3
Josh seems like the Chinese knock off of Chinese tik-tok.,7
Meme derby gonna go till the last over,3
Alpha KL bringing Gayle to be a spectator to Kohli's destruction,9
Too much experimenting will cost us today,8
Yeah bowl siraj and get hit to oblivion,4
Siraj has a proper generic Haryanvi face.,3
So Sundar really is sick,7
Why the hell would you not bowl sundar in powerplay????????,5
The real question is how KXIP will screw up today.,3
Swann taking a dig at Siraj lmao,8
"I dont understand why Chris Gaylle is in the team if he is not opening, he wont be able to milk spinners for singles.",5
"Public service announcement -

Herbal Life is MLM. Stay away from it.",4
Post match presentation is going to be fun.,3
Rcb need to stick to their strengths rather than going with the flow and following a trend,3
"Lord is here, see how he takes both wickets and shows who is he boss.",4
man rcb winning games made me forget about kohli's absolute senseless captaincy for a while. thanks for the reminder koach,8
This opening partnership is basically 95% of punjab batting.,10
LORD SIRAJ,6
I feel like Siraj will take a wicket now,1
Love the commitment from Morris here,2
"For ppl asking for Gayle to open, this is why. Dont fix what is not broken. Gayle is a player that works best in PP, but not the player who only works in PP.",2
Punjab playing really good today so far👏🏽,4
"Hey, we have Washi whose economy is less than 5. Let's not give him any overs in power play. RCB thinking",16
"DC and RCB will be in the final. DC will win in their second season. Trust me, I’ve seen this play out before.’",7
This man is an absolute clown career economy 9.14 wtf,6
WHY IS SUNDAR NOT BOWLING,8
How d fuk do you get picked in an IPL franchise with an economy over 9? Is Siraj a wicket taker?,13
Motherfuckers shit the bed against every team but suddenly become godly against us,10
"Siraj is someone we should all look up to. Can't bat, can't bowl, can't field, and still manages to consistently make an IPL XI.",2
So after this punjab has only 2 more batsman right?,9
"Ight Bois, just a quick question. Who's worse - Siraj or Umesh?",3
"Koach again with a stupid decision to keep Sundar, especially when KXIP made their hittin intentions clear around over 3/4. Let them try to go after Sundar who's bagged important wickets in PP.",7
This match shows the importance of good captaincy.,7
Looks like Koach has given up,5
"KL Rahul's transition from attacking in the first couple of matches to batting slowly thereafter lowkey reminds me of Sachin in the late 90s and early 2000s. 

People said he realized that the team collapses often after his wicket  so he became more careful. In the early 2000s, whenever Sachin was in an attacking mood, someone in the neighborhood would say 'arre Sachin purane form me hai' (T: Sachin is in his old form today) and people would turn on their TVs if they hadn't already. Good thing Sachin kind of rebuilt himself after the 2007 wc disaster, was a treat to watch between then and 2011 wc",3
Popular opinion: Kohli is an awful captain,13
"I was so happy as a RCB fan this year... Until now :(

Cheer me up",3
"If you haven't seen the Miandad Pepsi ad spoof by now, pls do yourself a favor and watch it, I'm lol",1
Rahul strike rate has gone down ever since he made that overrated comment lol,3
The only thing IPL has taught me is not to commit to or hold an opinion. I have backtracked way too many times this season when we are barely halfway through.,7
I hope this IPL puts Mayank Aggarwal in contention for white ball cricket Indian team as well. The man has scored heaps of runs in domestic cricket and is finally showing his worth in IPL as well. He deserves it.,12
KL and Mayank are in great touch. KXIP could win this match today if they score more than RCB,9
Yeah Mayank hit him,6
"No one

Sharjah DJ : OOOOOOOOOOOOOO",7
Siraj after a dot: Where’s my award,9
"they're probably saving sundar for gayle

absolute scenes when gayle smashes him for 5 sixes",6
Sundar has been on the emerging player shortlist for the past 5 years,7
"Maxi and Sundar have done a team reversal idk how, Sundar was supposed to bowl Maxi overs and the other way too",8
So Washington's role is gonna be similar to how Narine was used against Punjab in the last game to choke the run flow.,6
Mayank's hitting is clean af,11
For fucks sake Kohli and RCB management. You lost the match yourself. You can't blame nobody.,5
[removed],8
"Siraj and shardul improved a lot, ngl",2
Agarwal closing in on the orange cap. Time for KL to run him out now,4
Shami just readjusted the target so that KL has more opportunity to score,3

bad captain ship by koach,1

Mayanks wicket deserves much more respect",1

Wish RCB had a decent Captain.,1

That's the feeling I am getting from this match.",3
"Send your in form batsman too late in the match...
Bring your in form bowler too late in the match...
Just RCB things",2
I keep reminding myself that both these teams can shit the bed at the flick of a switch. It's not over till it's over.,6
Why isn't Sundar bowling?,2
"Someone shud get out now

Wanna see Gayle milk spinners for sixes",4
Siraj looks like a douchebag,1
I hope to see Mayank play like this in Test matches = possibly next Sehwag,5
Aaron Finch should retire from IPL,2
Love seeing Mayank bat usually but he has to go,7
this game is dead already peak RCB,3
I think kohli is just REALLY going all out experimentation cuz its punjab and rcb as of now can afford a loss,2
Koach not having a good day today.,3
I like the mayank approach of going the arial route in first 6 overs. Works always,1
Why not fucking bowl Sundar ?,2
KL is not only making a case for test team but also helping his friend get spot in t20 team,4
"Siraj has really improved since last year, good attacking bowling",4
"Ah so it's shaping up to be another one of those ""we shoulda won this""",5

RCB vs RCB 2.0,5
Where is sundar????,2
RCB gonna RCB :D,7
No ab where he belonged no sundar where he belongs. What is koach doing,6
Mayank and KL are really good. I don't quite fully understand how KXIP are rock bottom.,6
"Siraj just brought his career economy down a fraction

I N T E N T",10
That save was hilarious.,3
Lmao they got 4 anyway,7
"They ran 3, village fielding",8
"Lmao commentators proper trolling: ""Only KXIP win has come against RCB this season""",2
"4 runs without a ball, great",9
Got 4 anyways,3
if we keep our cool like kkr we got this,7
Chahal is also bowling badly,1
How many seasons before RCB realize that Koach is one of the significant enough reason (among few other important reasons) that they have not won an IPL title?,8
What kind of lagaan fielding was that,3
Come on not another one sided game . Give us a last ball finish .,1
"At this rate, they're going to finish the game in 15 overs, without losing a wicket.",3
They ran 3 in Sharjah 😂😂😂,4
Are they saving Sundar for Gayle?,3
We need RCB anxiety support thread,4
I smell a Six loading,3
What are the chances that KIngs 11 can win this without losing a wicket? Or perhaps without losing more than 2-3 wickets.,2
Royal Challengers Punjab running away with this match,3
Bowling Chahal feels like an act of desperation.,2
Now rahul into slow boi mode,3
Still no Washington Sundar,3
You never *want* to do things that are Silly Sunny,4
"Demoted AB de Villiers

No Sundar in Powerplay yet

Have RCB been over smart tonight?",8
Sunny G - important for KXIP not to do anything silly. Bruh!!!,4
Is Kohli not bowling Sundar because of the two right handers? Missed powerplay opportunity for rcb.,3
"Rcb player's finally settling up wirh their roles in team 

koach : let's shake things up",9
100 to get off 74,4
I think Sundar will be used like Narine today,4
Is that a first 3 runs running in Sharjah?😅😂,7
Mayank looks a bit shaky after the powerplay,2
Kohli happy to lose to bro KL twice,3
Wtf are they saving Washington for?,1
We need wickets. Controlling run rate doesn't seem to work,2
Sundar's gonna bowl 16-20.,2
"Kxip today has :

Come on! Give that man a chance.. Bring Mr.Gayle in please..,0
Mayank is brilliant,2
Holding my breath for a brain dead moment,2
"The thing I like about Mayank is he is such a good player of spin , can takes singles anytime and hit big shots if he wants to. Puts the pressure on the bowling side.",7
"Unless RCB is playing ABD be a specialist Keeper and Sundar as a specialist batsmen, I see no logic in today's decisions",5

Chahal's bye bye celebration is my favourite ever already ngl,10
Gayle vs Sunder,1
Hahahah that cheeky bye bye,7
That was a sassy goodbye by Chahal,5
Show is over. It was fun while it lasted,3
KXIP has been unlucky this seaon. They had 1 match go to superover. 1 where they lost by only 1-2 runs (one where Maxi was inches short).,4
Fin-fuckin-ly,2
Nice send-off is worth more than fair play table positioning.,6
Will it be Pooran in at 3 ? Gayle to bat as finisher,4
Both teams playing on different pitches. Our opening feels like joke now.,3
I like that goodbye wave. No big celebration. gg chahal.,7
Giving him a send off after getting cunted for 28 off 2 lol,13
"That's really well bowled

Dipped and turned

That little wave bye bye as well lmao",7

GAYLE STORM COMING,5
The fucking wave off.,6
"Bro. I know run-rate is important. But you guys need the win a lot more.

Chahal is their best spinner. Don’t get too cocky ffs.",3
No more 1s forget 2s.,5
KXIP rn: *Self-distruct activated*,11
Was loving Mayanks inning but that was a beautiful ball. Pitched on middle-leg (?) hit top of off.,3
"Proper leg break, that",2
Gaylestorm™ incoming.,4
"Chahal pal he already smashed you, no need to act cocky",11
High intent 45> tuk tuk 75,10
"They are gonna choke, aren't they ?",3
Why Mayank!!,3
"Damn, that was a cuck move from Yuzi.",3
Kohli will someday turn RCB into RBC,2
"THE UNIVERSE BOSS IS HERE, EVERYBODY CALM DOWN",3
How can you send off someone whose cunted you for 4 boundaries LOL,2
Lara you beauty,2
Should've played it safe,3
"Mayank : You didn’t retain me Kohli , le mera
Chahal next ball: chal nikal lavde",2
*Anime opening for Gayle Entrance*,4
[deleted],2
"See this is Rahul's problem. 28 off 23, it's not an ODI where he can afford to do that",1
Chahal being arrogant didnt saw mayank dancing when he was hitting sixes,1
"So it's 70-30 to bowling team.. 

Sums up RCB form...",2
"This is not a hard pitch to bat on Rcb made it look so, teams should still chase 210+ in Sharjah from the get go,you’ll atleast make 190. Don’t play as if it’s a 150ish wicket",2
RCB should eat a shoe if Sundar doesn't come on to bowl this over.,6
ENTER THE UNIVERSE BOSS.,2
Swanny reminds me of ozzy man,1
Hopefully Gayle eats 10 balls,1
"SunnyG : Kxip should just knock it around for 1s and 2s.

Mayank hits 6.

Sunny G : Thats a very very very good shot.

Mayank gets out.

SunnyG : He should have knocked it around.",3
Chahal has so much attitude for a dogshit bowler,-1
Wow that wave😂😂😂,1
It's showtime Bois.,3
"I thought Mayank was in for another 40+ runs today. Still, well played",2
I feel this will turn ugly for RCB. Leggo gaylo,1
"But good innings from Mayank, played better than every RCB batsman today.",2
"Honestly man, batsmen need to show a little bit of that “respect” they show to Rashid to Chahal as well.",6
"When you absolutely feel safe, you can have more fun- RCB hmmmmmmmm",2
Such an unnecessary shot. Already 13 runs in the over. And with the “depth” KXIP have that was extra stupid,4
I want to see some Gayle,1
That was a great but unnecessary MKC from Kohli.,2
"Chahal tho is getting the ball to drift and slightly grip, so beautiful out of the hand",1
"virat kohli: bhenchod

stop dragging people's sisters into cricket, virat. didn't Anuskha tell you?",9
KL Rahul has to forget 2 runs exist now.. its only singles and 6's now boys.,3
"It's nice he got out on the last ball, just one ad break now",8

Chahal mate you’ve just been smashed please don’t wave like that,8
Dont Blush babies!! Universe Boss is here😎😎,3
"Slow motion koach is always dealing in bhenchods, I feel.",4
Sundar into the attack right.,2
"One of the main reason behind RCB being shit was being oversmart sometime and weird tactics doesn't return the right result. Guess what, by not sending ABD and not using their best powerplay bowler. They're trying to repeat their over smartness.",7
It's (Universal) Boss Time!!,3
Job done by Mayank. Koach shouting looks stupid.,7
The wave was similar to the Tendulkar wave,5
"Literally every cricket fan rn 

*aiye aapka intazar tha*",7
Please bring Washi Koach.,4
Poor bowling,1
I wanna see gayle running 3 at sharjah,5
Time for 'Gayle's BAT SO BIG'...,3
KL - Time to turn it on and sheet anchor the heck outta this chase.,3
"Ideally, KL should take an over and go be the agressor and Gayle can take it easy for couple overs",3
Gayle could u win us another game by scoring 15(30)? Please...😁,7
Sundar economy 6.9. nice,5
I have lost hope for winning but i hope our nrr doesn't get fucked again.,4
Perfect stage set for a monumental KXIP screw up,7
Can't take 2s with Gayle in.,8

Rip running,2
So here is the ipl,6
"Gayle, Pooran, Maxii, we're fucked",11
Gayle looks so biggg,3
"Chahal looked very uncomfortable during that ""celebration""",0
Will that Chahal bye put RCB at the bottom of the fair play table?,4
Proper Defence,1
Siraj may be a shit bowler but he seems to be a good guy eh,5
Krishna Goyal on the strike after a long time,6
Chad Chahal says goodbye,3
"Gayle does waste a lot of PP deliveries. I can see what Rahul was going for, attacking in the PP and keeping the score fast enough that Gayle can take a few balls in the middle before attacking, and clearly it worked pretty well.",3

Being a cunt to one of the nicest guys around 😒😒,10
LMAO.. Gayle first ball: beautifully defended,8
Gayle almost fell face first lmao.,6
"Gayle keep it cool against Sundar, just like that",3
So weird watching Gayle at 3,6

Lmaoo he almost tripped.,7
Gayle tried to run too fast there,4
Gayle shows that he is uncomfortable with a single.,4
"KXIP could lose Gayle, Pooran and Maxwell in the space of three balls.",3
"I'd like to see a gayle storm, not today.",5
"I want to see Kohli and Gayle play together again, just to see if Kohli would ever complete quick singles or Twos.",4
Yuzi's so cool. Looks aren't everything,5
"Serious Gayle alert, he ran a single",8

Singles with Gayle.. lol,15
Haha Gayle cant run lol,7
No Sneaking Singles With Gayle🚫,5
Dont get me wrong i love kholi’s passion for the game but HATEEEEE when is screams like a little bitch after a wicket lmao just think its funny 😂,8
"Don't understand Chahal's celebration there. Dude has literally dismantled you for more than 20-25 already, you taking his wicket now and celebrating makes it look like he just hit a six and got out",15
"Gayle enters, 2 runs: Am I a joke to u?",10
How did VK and Gayle amass so many runs as a pair given Gayle can't run for shit,17
Why does KL play such chutiya shots?,5
That's right Jadhav. Even Chris Gayle takes single within the first 3 balls,23
This don’t feel good lol.,3
Lol Sundar want Gayle back on strike,2
That bat looks like a tooth pick,9
They were holding Sundar for Gayle and Pooran?,5
[removed],9
Rahul has to go for the boundaries or settle for the singles. He will have to live with his decision to keep Gayle until after the PP.,3
Gayle is not gonna run :),9
KL wanting quick singles with Gayle lol,9
Not sure i understand Sundar's length to KL,5
Should have opened with mayank and Gayle,11
"Gavaskar truly doesn't get it. A 45 off 25 is better than 70 off 50 for your team in chases like this. Batsmen down the order don't want to come in with 10 an over needed on a tired pitch, even if an established batsman is there with them. They would much rather get 7 an over. At that point it doesn't matter if the batsmen are new or not, they can just knock it about. This attitude pervades Indian cricket and it's why our batsmen slow down in an effort to stay during the middle overs. Mayank trying to hit another six is a **positive, not negative**.",23
Washi’s just too good,3
The fuck is wrong with Kohli? Doesn't want to win anymore?? Why no Sundar in the PP today?,13
Sundar as usual giving RCB quiet overs,12
Gayle not running will make KL go for his shots. Kumble 4d chess masterstroke confirmed.,13

Gayle Ran 4 Singles in this over,8
Nehra still sucking off to dhoba in an rcb kxip game,11
Mayank threw his wicket away. He was looking so good that he could have won the game for KXP. Anyway Universal Boss will play with a chip on his shoulder. That is a dangerous proposition for RCB. This is a game only KXP can win or lose. There is little that RCB could do.,11
Am I wrong in saying Gayle looks like Predator?,7
Navdeep Saini looks like he bout to kill someone,11
2 more wicket this over and we're quite safe for a while,4
"Atleast kl showing some intent to hit

But why not hit with straight bat

Why all those funky shots",8

How many of these damn betting apps are there? Just saw an ad for something called gamezy.,7
i always forgot how huge gayle is,8

Mixed metaphor of the day : Gayle train to have a long takeoff run and then quickly capsize.,2
"Why is Sundar bowling half trackers to Rahul? 

Also, Koach making a real pot pourri by shuffling bowling orders.",11
Switch to dougout.. It is kinda fun,11
This is too confusing. Why is RCB is bowling to RCB,62

"At 41, he is quicker than Jagadeesan/Rayudu.",7
"It's hilarious that people act like Rahul is some lone warrior forced to play like this because his team is shit, when Agarwal has been so much better than him the entire tournament",4
Gayle is kinda giving me 2020 MS Thala vibes.,4
most of you are probably too young to remember this but i remember when gayle opened the batting and bowling and kept wicket,9
Commentators literaly try so damn hard to justify every decision taken by Kohli by showing weird stats,5
KL 'Strike rate is very overrated' Rahul,11
Gayle striking at 33                                                                                KL - They called me a Mad Man,7
"Gayle be like 
Need to bring that RR down for last ball finish",5
I'm generally not afraid of gayle but ex rcb players always seem to play really well against rcb.,4
What is with the universe thing guys? Can someone explained plz?,2
hit a six bosss,3
"Lip reading Kohli, 99% sure he said Behan Ki Choot",6
"Guys, GOOD NIGHT this game is dead and buried now we have let KXIP come back and start to compete for that 4th spot",4
Steven Smith is an anagram of Semen hits tv,13
"Oh RCB were at a similar stage with an extra wicket down, I might have some hope after all",5
Please no Chris “Kedar Jadhav” Gayle today,7
"Gayle c'mon, I'm holding my pee cuz I don't want to miss ur first six this ipl",4
Gayle's edge will go for sixes here dont worry,2
Abe nehra kya bake ja raha hain,6
Gayle should get another season with csk would be fun,11
"If you couldn't score by actually running, Gayle would probably be the GOAT",5
Gayle can single handedly win the match for KXIP but he shouldn’t be batting at 3.,4
I'm so nervous seeing Gayle,4
Gayle will go unsold next year. He is too much weight for a team literally and figuratively. You have to play him because of the brand value and he is very inconsistent.,4
Kohli and Rahul to star in the new Ramesh-Suresh ad,6
"I miss the days when we had these 2 playing for RCB.

Gayle, Kohli, AB, KL, Watson as our top 5...... and we still could not win the IPL",11

"Gayle bids his time Vs Saini, may be sundar. Only chahal can outfox him",4

Rahul again digging a hole for his teammates to fall in.  Good news is he's still locked in on the purple cap.,5

Gayle is waiting for Siraj.,13

Punjab are going to fuck this up again. Likh ke le lo,11
"Gayle could have done what Mayank did, but Mayank can do both what Mayank did and what Gayle can't do now in the middle overs.",12
How many yorkers have RCB bowled until now,6
KXIP going to lose a lot of momentum here,8
"I always forget that this guy has also hit two test triple centuries. He’s insane all round, used to bowl as well.",14
I am just scared of the anti climax where Gayle goes back without hitting a single six,25
Universe boss with the universe dots,8
Shoaib Malik?  that's surprising,2
Good one Saini,1
Gayle with a QUICK^(TM) single.,9
No one critical of universe boss because we know once he gets going 90 runs can be a piece of cake,12

"Saini bowling his 3rd. So hopefully Siraj is brought on in the death, ngl I miss that, classic RCB and some sweet memes",7

Gayle please destroy RCB they don't deserve to win after releasing you.,12
88 of 60 with 9 wickets.,5

it was Mayank dominating RCB",10
What are you guys on Gayle has always played like this for a couple of years now,12
"I am hundred percent sure fans at Chinnaswamy would have boycotted the game the minute they didn't see ABD walk out to bat after the 2nd wicket. 


I still remember when I witnessed a game there back in 2015, people were cheering when Kohli got out because ABD was coming out to bat.",18
Inb4 gayle increases pressure on KL and KL gets out,15

Gayle with the glorious 20 strike rate.,3
"LMAO, Sunny G is also fed up of the Altroz.",5
Imagine a prime Gayle hitting a six on this ground,3
I'm glad that Rahul has a front seat to watching his decisions backfire. He has had brainfade after brainfade.,3
Possibly silly question: what happens if a six damages the car? Do the sponsors just send out a replacement to the winner?,7
"Granted gayle is not opening, the gayle hype train is crashing :(",9
This is mecha-Gayle. He understands stuff in 1s and 0s,5

Gayle would rather be drinking Hennessey at a covid infested Usain Bolt party,8
KL should be doing better here tbh in the last 3 overs,3
Gayle played more than 10 balls. Already exceeded my expectations,7
MI score 79 runs off last 4 overs. KXIP has 5 more overs and only 7-8 more runs.,6
"What are the smallest factors that could have contributed to a team's performance? For example, in the first IPL auction, maybe someone in a team's management stuffed on Pani Puri before the auction and during the auction he realized his stomach is not cut out for that and he tried to half ass a couple of players, like 'this Kohli lad is good but let RCB have them, not paying that much'",8
Punjab bottling it again??,4
I saw gayle move a bit and was like here comes a six but no,9
can sundar be the next jadeja?,15
Mandeep and Gurkeerat would’ve been good here,8
I know it takes time to settle in but this is test match level from the universe boss.,10

Gayle to explode next over!,2

Poori duniya se kaho copy that! That's cringey 😂,3
"There a bot that counts the number of times someone says ""Strike rate is overrated!!"" on this sub? What's the count now?",3
Gayle should have opened when the ball was new and Rahul should have come in at no 3 ....Gayle is going to struggle more as pitch gets slower,7
The choke is on!!,3
Only KXIP can fuck this up after such a good start. Them and us.,3
Gayle always plays out any good bowlers. That is how he made a career.,1
A six by Gayle could reach one of the apartments nearby,3
Gayle doing a Tewatia impression.,7
Gayle is done,1
Decent batting this from both the batsmen should get around 300 at the end of 50 overs.,4
KL just let go of Orange Cap obsession and start fucking hitting shots,3
"Boys : Gayle is so slow today


Men: He wants to really fuck RCB up today",10
Getting comprehensively beaten is better than choking it at the end at least,3

Oh god. Siraj to Gayle,7
Rahul fuck off have you not learnt a single thing,3
Gayle's gotta do well here... There's an RCB ex player curse to uphold.,5
On one hand I’m rooting for Gayle and on the other Siraj. Fuck me.,3
The tuk tuk adventures of KL Rahul,3
"How about this? KXIP buys Jaydev Unadkat, makes him the captain. That'll take pressure off KL, Unadkat has proven as a captain and he's been shit for RR but surprisingly does well for other teams.",2
3 good overs with a wicket or 2 can change things here,4
Before this IPL I thought KL is potentially the next Indian captain.  Now I feel he will be disaster. He is not really smart and may even be selfish.  Rahul should have scored at least two boundaries since Gayle arrived so ease the pressure off.,14
6 6 6 coming,5
This is why Gayle should have opened with Mayank. Gayle starting out + KL is just suffocating.,13
Can't believe i'm saying this but Gayle absolutely killed KXIP's momentum,10
"Man, can just one inside edge hit the fucking stumps",6
Shit tomorrow head to head record will put everything else to shame,3
"RCB did the right thing using spinners to choke runs and play to Gayle's tendency to start slow and defensive, now puts extra pressure on KL that can lead to playing risky shots or runout chances.",1

Maxwell needs to get in there asap,2
Wait this guy hasn’t played till January wtf?,2
Gayle has become Yuvraj.,7
What the fuck did ppl expect from a 60 year old Gayle,6
You don't need wickets when the batsman are scoring 1s and 0s,5
"When you have Gayle in your team , why not have him open and make use of powerplay and have Rahul do his tuk tuk at no 3. This is some next level suicide by Kings11. Even CSK cannot match this.",4
"If there's one bowler to target, surely it's Siraj",2
Fuck me,2
agent gayle activated,2
Gayle was done 2 seasons ago. Why are you people surprised?,3
How big was that!!,2
What a 6 from Rahul lol,2
Unpopular opinion but I think Gayle is done,5
"People here watching Gayle for the first time or what? He almost  always needs 10-15 balls to get going, that's why he's best as an opener.",4
KL: i'l do this myself,3
KP what the fuck are you going on about?,3
Wrong line,1
Rahul be like fuck you I'm the real universe boss,1
This is definetly one the top fuck ups this tournament. They're going to lose this. No doubt about that,1
Don't question Universe Boss you peasants,4
Jeez. KL. Whaaaat a beaut!,1
Gayle just being loyal to his friends in RCB.,6
Tuk tuk goes brrrrrr,2
I wouldn't drive by Sharjah Stadium now,7
Siraj you dumdum that was a rasgulla length,3
"These two must be programmers, they only understand the 1s and 0s of binary code.",3
What Punjab are missing is a batsman like SKY. Before him Rohit was forced to go into the middle order to plug the holes in our batting order.,3
Long overdue boundary,2
Siraj 2019 PTSD,4
Beautiful shot,5
Couple more of these in next 4 balls. Thanks.,3
Jesus Fucking Christ what a 6.,6
Kayle and Gayle,2
I mean the amount of cricket gayle has played i think he would know how to get back to his game lmao,2
"Ah, the dreaded length ball",8
That was huge,7
Holy shit. That was big.,7
Wtf KP that's not because of Gayle. It's just KL,12
KP just talks so much bollocks,4
The KKR loss broke Rahul it seems.,5
"KXIP : Lets play gayle in middle overs.

Gayle 5(13) not rotating strike.

KXIP : Surprised dumb pikachu face.",5
Tomorrow kkr vs mi lmao. Do kkr fans have any hope left?,6
Binga called the six lol,6
Fuck me that sounded nice,6
"Shut the fuck up KP, giving Chris Gayle who is batting like my nan credit for incredible hitting from Rahul",8
"Take that

For all those shitting on orange cap holder",10
"Siraj and Stokes have same hairstyle, Coincidence I think not",6
any RCB fan still have hope?,5
Why exactly is Lord Siraj in the team?,9
Lol Siraj,1
Siraj... Siraj... Siraj...,1
Siraj why,1
That was humongous,4
"Need Runs , Siraj is here",9
Damn bro!!!!,1
Lord is backk Lord is backk,4
Jfc that was massive,6
That’s huge,5
"For all the shit KL Rahul gets, he really looks like a talented bat!",6
Rahul can play fast but he just doesn't for some reason,9
KL listened to y'all.,4
Two balls gone outta Sharjah,5
"Aight, that’s the end of Siraj:(",4
EA cricket 07 chal rha hai,3
DAddy Rahul!! *slurp *slurp *slurp,5
Cunted,2
So lovely to watch KL bat this way,3
Our Lord And Saviour Siraj.,6
"Nehraji, see that's what happens when someone bowls length.",3
"Fuckin Rahul can play like this but opts not to is, for viewers it's like watching porn without having sex",7
Lord siraj is back (´;︵;`),8
[deleted],10
Woah woah woah what is this intent,3
Lord Siraj always surprises the opposition,7
Man Siraj does well to fuck it up,3
"Rahul showing INTENT 2 back to back sex👏🏽👏🏽

Edit:sixes",2
This is the real KL babyyy,3
That's the Siraj that we love and know.,4
Did KP really just credit Gayle for that 6 Rahul hit. What the fuck am I hearing,9
One length ball gone the distance. Imma bowl one more. Lord for a reason.,7
And again!!! HUUUUGgGEEE,2
Should've seen the end to this over coming a mile off..,1
LORD SIRAJ!!!!!!,6
KL turned out to be the Gayle we were promised,3
"MADARCHOD KP, RAHUL HITS A SIX AND HE SAYS ""THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GAYLE IS AT THE CREASE,""

CHUTIYAPA KA HADD HOTA HAI",7
How far did the second 6 go? Seems quite the distance ...,2
Only happens with rcb bowlers lol,1
2 in a row. KL got his flow seem so,1
"13 runs in 22 balls

12 runs in 2 balls",2
Will the next be held in april 21 and in uae  ?,2
Siraj back to form,2
Finally some INTENT,1
"Siraj at his best, releasing the pressure.",4
Please no more siraj...ever again,2
Thats a right proper cunt from KL Rahul.,2
When will this Siraj experiment end 🤦,5
I wont be surprised if there is a sponsorship for balls at this point,1
Intent from KL. Good job Gayle :),3
Did siraj paint his face?,2
Kl: look at me I'm Gayle now,4
"Well played KL, show em how it is done. Finish this game",2
I don't mind us losing to the legendary Gayle Storm.,2
That six was just like my dick Long and Big,1
OMG Lord Siraj is back in form,4
Jesus Christ that is huge,2
any RCB fan still have hope?,3
Sixraj is back bitches,3
KL doing an Anti-Thala now.,2
"Siraj isn't back, he never went anywhere.",5
KL on 🔥,3
Jesus Fuck. Stop complaining about Gayle going slow. This is what he has ALWAYS done. And it works.,6
No way that KXIP can lose this one,5
Thank you Siraj nice job.,4
Thanks for nothing Siraj,5
[deleted],10
4D move by Gayle to force KL play the shots.,5
Thank you Siraj,2
 Intent by KL you motherfuckers,2
"Yeah, that's right, there's your lesson, no more Siraj overs this match now.",7
Very bad ball,2
"Jesus I hope that people now get KL's role in the team. He can anchor on one end with Mayank, Pooran, Maxwell and now Gayle able to hit out",6
Had to be Siraj,3
Siraj doesn't even need Gayle on strike to get hit for monstrous sixes lol,8
"Gayle out in the middle and it is raining sixes ... Just want we wanted 


Right guys? Guys?",6
Can Siraj not play pls,4
"KL Rahul without Gayle: Strike Rate is very very overrated.

KL Rahul with Gayle: Fuck it, hit sixes.",10
KP crossing all levels of bullshit with that Gayle comment. Stupid shithead.,11
Lord Siraj will ensure smooth win for KXIP,12
Has Siraj ever done a good thing in cricket?,7
"KL to this thread posters : chat shit, get banged",10
That’s killed all pressure.,1
Siraj is so shit man! Deserves the shit economy he has,3
"Siraj bowls one in the slot and get hits for Six.

I am gonna bowl another, what could go wrong",10
Lord Siraj doing god's work. Thanks Anna,10
KL batting with some positive intent ™ today!!!,2
"Lara said wicket alert, he’s right most of the time in those. Gayle might go bois.",6
Can both teams win?,6
Those two sixes relieves huge pressure from King XI. Let's go!,11
Seeing Gayle like this is genuinely sad,8
Lol no one knows how useless Siraj is at t20 than ex RCBians..,10
Looks huge but the boundary is like 50 metres. Probs would have just cleared the inner circle at the MCG too Big,11
IPL is so much better to watch when the camera is not cutting to cheerleaders and  ridiculous fanboi costumes every 30 seconds.,8
You can tell KP thought Gayle hit that six and is still trying to dig himself out of the hole,8
That 2 sixes is the game,2
Assume match is 19 overs and finish it off!,3
2019 Siraj activated.,2
What is the trick to Washington being able to choke runs out so well?,2
Siraj keeps the tradition of the headband alive!,5
Want to see more of this aggressive KL Rahul,3
"See Rahul, with those two sides your strike rate increases and when you strike rate increases you get closer to the other teams total. 

It's almost as if strike rate matters",9
"All that pressure and two sixes from half volleys do the trick. Bravo Siraj, bravo.",3
MI are playing CSK and SRH at Sharjah. Lowkey worried now coz the pitch has been slow lately and these two attacks can use it well,4
KL on song is such a joy to watch. He can time the pants off everything. No clue why he tuktuks when he can skin the ball like that.,7
Siraj can't bowl in middle overs also,3
Sanjay Bangar's hindi is as bad or maybe worse then his English,2
It will never not be funny watching Siraj getting tonked,3
"Mohammed Siraj: has first-class bowling average of 23.

Also Mohammed Siraj: averages 30 at an economy rate of 9.2 in the IPL.

Indian selectors: let's play him exclusively in the white-ball formats.",13
Kohli made every stupid decision possible,7
"If KL is modelling himself around Virat, the one skill he must learn is to finish the game.",5
Sometimes I feel like Siraj is a mole in RCB from KXIP and a few other teams,3
Imagine the only two games KXIP win this season are against RCB lmao trust,9
HERE WE GOOO,3
He’s back. Somewhat.,3
Vintage Gayle,4
VK has to stop doing batdeep from now on,2
Take that!!! UNIVERSE BOSS is BACK,3
Sundar's plan to Rahul is to just get him off strike?,2
JAAN MEIN JAAN AAYI.,7
Gayle train started.,5
There you go,3
 OH YESSSS!!! INJECT IT INTO MY VAINS,6
Dunno about you guys but KL really wants to live on the edge. He fist bumped Gayle and then kissed his glove. In 2020! 🤨,11
"KP's a prick, how can he attribute rahul's sixes to gayle being at the crease?",8
Don't blush baby,5
"Welcome back, Gayle! :)",6
"BOSS IS HERE BOYS, STRAP IN",7
Gayle will butcher bowlers on this ground.,7
bruh this is it 💀,5
Gaylestorm here boys! Just rcb things,9
That looked so effortless,6
That lady in the RCB camp looks like a harpy eagle,2
"Goodnight fellow rcb fans, see you guys on Saturday",8
Gayle has arrived,8
1st player to hit six against washi in this ipl?,3
Alight bois. Buckle up,3
Dinda studies at Siraj Academy,3
Universe Boss is back.,2
Shit it has started,5
Yessss first six of the IPL for the universe boss,7
He makes it look so easy,3
Hopefully Siraj is dropped,2
Little full ball and it's gone.,3
Universe boss is back at it boys.,6
Siraj has the least disguised slower ball ever lmao. Might as well tell KL at the top of his run up that he's gonna bowl it.,10
Bangar :- *Chris Gayle dete rahenge*,11
RCB nrr back to where it belongs,6
Who do you guys prefer khaeel or Siraj. Who is better?,2
"Suburb Boss!!!

District Boss!!!",4
Wtf that looked like a chip shot,11
Welcome back Universe Boss,8
Papa Gayle's still got it.,7
"Thats it

My day is done

Thank u boss",13
Stright drive to six --  this is Gayle.,5
**I am lokey stressed that with all the pitches slowing down CSK would make UAE Chepauk**,15
There has to be a clause where you have to include Gayle in the XI if you pick him,13
ok this is painful,13
"No one , Absolutely no one : 

Binga : He's a suburb boss at the moment",19
Universe boss is back,10
UNIVERSE BOSS👏🏽👏🏽,10
Lol,2
Honestly well bowled to not get tonked for 20 after the first 6.,8
Gayle God,3
Bye bye economy,4
Ok Bois. Nrr gonna take hit for RCB  now,5
"Half season transfer from rcb should be siraj and umesh. Never want to see these clowns again
I reckon they're old enough to qualify for csk",3
Take that!! Big Daddy G is here.,6
"Dube should be benched. Doesn’t bowl that well, isn’t reliable down the order. Gurkeerat better",3
RCB is back to form.,14
B0ss,6
Fapping begins,6
GAYLE ACTIVATED,5
Gayle set to Play at 3 from now on boys,10
Ah how did I miss you,3
This Sharjah pitch is baffling as fuck. Do they just replace it between the innings lmao,8
Six shots making me do cum shots,2
Mc star sports ad chala diya,3
I am in love with that Punjab girl😍😅,-1
"4 sixes in two overs , that helps a lot",3
Ty for releasing some pressure.,1
It's like they told Gayle to give himself an over before hitting away.,6
RCB is kil,3
Universe BOSS,2
Economy fucked sundarly,2
KXIP is batting very well. Now I'm scared they will lose somehow,2
RCB playing like rcb we know,3
Exciting to see the RCB bowling attack back in form :),3
supporting RCB is injurious to health,6
Gayle on District Boss level now!!,5
Rashid the other day and Sundar today,2
Done & Dusted,2
Imagine losing to punjab lol,9
"We had a good run lads, see ya next year",6
If Gayle hits 2-3 more sixes and gets out i'm not even mad lol,8
Nothing in the IPL is more hilarious than an exRCb player coming back to smack them around,6
Hat bhosdiwala. Fuck this match. They'll again absolutely ruin our nrr. I'm going to sleep ffs,7
These two making a mockery of the idea that this pitch is difficult to bat on. Kohli played a match losing innings.,6
"Done and dusted, this match. If Gayle gets going, no thing's gonna work. Watch Kohli get desperate now.",6
Hope the haters can stfu now,1
Dhoni ads have been a bit too much now,0
Game over,2
"Child's play, huh.",1
Gayle the finisher!,2
"I can feel it
Kxip win with 20+ balls left incoming",2
NRR joins the chat,6
"Again, he did it again. Two sixes to Sundar. Amazing.",3
Dumb to not play Gayle from the first match,3
So you are telling me KXIP can lose this one?,1
"alright KXIP, just don’t pull an RR now",3
Pack it up boys. RCB back to true form.,9
I can’t wait to see how we fuck this up from here.,5
**Take shelter everbody...The Storm has started**,4
Only Gayle can do this to Sundar. Universe Boss is here!!!!! LMAO,2
UNIVERSE BOSS,3
Desperation™ with Morris in.,1
Only 3 overs of spin left just get 18 of them and not get out and we would need 35 off 4 overs of pace,1
"If anyone's gonna spank our asses, I'm glad its Chris ""Don't blush baby"" Gayle",6
Gayle heard y’all talking shit,6
The universe boss gets into the action as well. Guess the pitch was just tricky for the RCB batsmen. Goodnight.,2
Only 2020 KXIP can lose this from now,2
Get ready to loose by huge margin...so we can count on other teams to loose/win so we can make it to playoffs,3
Virat was right about Kumble,1
Gayle with some nimble footwork there lol.,4
Serious credit to Gayle for being so patient and picking the right bowls to attack.,4
Genuine question. Dre Russell is pure power but from the looks if it Gayle is power and timing?,6
That punjabi girl cute af,2
RCB showing KXIP who is real RCB in style,3
Got to the point its easy enough for punjab to now lose,2
Gayle is the closest cricket has to a Zlatanesque character isn't he?,6
Watch Gayle do a tewatia,1
Don't know why people though Gayle would go from first ball. He was never like that.,1
Washington got smacked. Match over,2
"Sundar doing brilliantly in power play. Everything going great. RCB bowling unit doing well with 5 bowlers. 

Koach - Hold my beer. 
Siraj, in you come. Extra bowling option(to help for opposite team). Sundar no more bowling in super over.",3
"""He's been waiting for the full ball, I kid you not"" you didnt need to tell us you weren't kidding about something so obvious Mark. His commentating has reached new levels of tedious this tournament.",3
Lurking CSK fans after these 2 big overs: Letzgoooooooooo,5
[deleted],4
I like Nicholas as a commentator but I don’t think he’s suited to T20,2
Yeah we cannot win this anymore. Can only rely on KXIP to lose it.,8
Punjab Should have released Hardon Viljoen and bought a decent Overseas Pacer,1
"And suddenly, Gayle is 20 of 18",2
Morris' neck is wide af,2
Don't know about y'all but I'm still watching because only kxip can snatch a loss from the jaws of victory,3
Kxip we want our daddy back and in return take your KFC 🤡,2
Come on guys do something,3
"Washington Sundar in first 7 games: 1 six 

1 game against Gayle: 2 sixes.",8
4 from 11 to 20 off 18 lol,4
Surely no way KXIP chokes from here RIGHT?,2
"Scenes if Punjab wins only two games this season and both against RCB

That would be some proper meme level exchange between two meme contenders",12
its impossible for KXIP to lose now 100% win,1
Anyone else watching the Tamil commentary feel annoyed every time Srikanth is on the mic? Its not like the others are like Harsha Bhogle standard but he is simply talking nonsense,1
Unpopular opinion: Gayle playing well today will hurt kxip in later matches because he will be undroppable and balance will be off. He wont be consistent.,8
"Honestly, if punjab lose from here - disband the franchise and forfeit all remaining games.",12
NOOOOOOO MY DREAMS,9
RIP Gayle.,4
I don't really care too much about the result... Just wanna see Gayle keep hitting sixes.,1
Lets shit on Udana and morris r/cricket,4
"Sundar: bowls economically all season

Gayle: Imma end this man's whole career",5
Virat's bowlers needs their A-game,2
No kxip doesnt want a sixer Mr DJ,2
Was there 2 noises?,1
Welp. seems like the Boss doesn't wanna leave,1
"Whenever Chris Gayle plays cricket, I see a lot of Black interracial p0rn in the following days",0
Gayle's call for review,1
A couple more matches like this and RCB fans too will start doing playoff calculations,3
Was looking plumb,3
"Ah fck, hopefully there was bat on it",3
"imo Gayle should see off this over, attack Chahal/Udana in next over",3
I WANNA SE GAYLE BAT MORE PLS NO,5
"When you realize that RCB once had KL Rahul, Chris Gayle and Mayank Agarwal as well. LOL.",14
Take the review for God’s sake,1
"Gayle did good enough IMO. Based on the required rate, making 20 from 19 is good. Prevents a collapse and took it deep.",3
Siraj gave them the momentum,3
"Here we go boys, review a plumb lbw. This is how we lose",-6
Well I think he's out.,0
"**Washington Sundar in IPL 2020**

First 7 matches: One SIX

**Tonight: Two sixes in an over from Universal Boss**

Also, completes 4,500 IPL runs.",11
That inside edge was thicker than Nicki Minaj,20
"Meme review if he hasn't hit it

EDIT: YAAAS 🤩🔥",1
The mad bastard actually hit it,8
How did the umpire not hear that,2
RCB are going to lose this match because of adhika prasangthana (trying to be too clever),8
Not out,5
[deleted],-4
Not out,3
Fck yes not out,1
Fuck.,1
Tough luck Morris. There's the bat.,3
FUCK YEAH BITCH,7
Really? Woah!,2
Thank fuck,3
Plumb in front,1
"**If fuckin KXIP lose from here, forfeit all the matches**",7
"haha, easiest LBW decision for the 3rd umpire",6
Gayle had no idea he edged it,15
YEAH,6
Hahaha get fucked thank u god,5
KXIP thinking of new ways to bottle this chase right as we speak,10
Ooooo.... I thought it was out.   0_o,2
Rock and Roll,3
No reprieve for RCB,2
"Yeah I thought he hit that

2 noises",3
Good review Gayle,5
Lesssss goooooooo,1
IPL umpire giving decision in your favour is directly proportional to the decibels of the appeal,4
What a one sided borefest this has become. Thanks to Kohli's stupidity.,1
Good review universe boss,6
"Had gayle stared at the umpire
.

There was no way he was gonna be given out",9
Even KXIP aren't losing this,3
"Gayle and Rahul are keeping the ""Ex RCB players"" meme alive and well..",8
Gayle's gigantic toe stopping him from being bowled,18
"If I was an RCB fan, I would demand a written apology from the entire leadership apologizing for sending AB at 6. One of the best batsmen in the Fucking world. The guy who hit a 70 something from 30 some balls two days ago on a pitch where a single batsmen couldn’t do diddly squat. The guy who has ripped apart attacks in test cricket. You don’t trust him to bat 12 overs after your second wickets falls. Shame. A fucking shame.",22
Good bowling from Morris. This is how you bowl to Gayle. Though its not out.,5
Why did Gayle not review that right away?!,6
"For an edge that thick, he took way too long to review it",4
Okay we got a flat line..haha blind third umpire,2
Ohhh... Thank the gods for the universal boss!,6
52 from 41 should be a piece of cake,11
Punish them Gayle!!!,2
You can tell Gayle hasn’t played for a while when he can’t tell that he’s hit the cover off it.,3
Mother fucking siraj must me as far away for the team as possible,3
Paddikkal needs to learn from how KL bats/progresses his innings.. he has so much potential and can be the next big thing for India,9
Why’s the ball hitting the bat during LBW not out anyway? The ball is blocked by the leg the same.,4
They didn’t even check ball tracking haha,5
How did he not realise he'd smashed it??,7
Thank the lord for drs,6
The bat didn't hit the ground wtf its clearly in the air,10
"Not enough balls for Pooran and Maxwell now i think, Gayle should go berserk now",6
Pls guys atleast try and save the nrr goddamn it,10
Oh well. Pls don't damage the NRR too much.,5
Gayle messing with his ex,3
Could bat have hit the ground?,3
I get so anxious when umpires take ages to give their decision on lbw's. Just make it quick man,7
I agree very good use of technology 👏🏽✌🏽,3
"Since KXIP is basically RCB this season, they're gonna be winning this game until the 19th over and then lose it in the most ridiculous fashion in the 20th over.",12
God this reminds me of the terror that Gayle used to unleash upon PWI and other teams. 👏👏,8
I hate this rule of the ball becoming dead before the review. They lost the single there. What a shit rule.,9
Why Gayle himself not sure about the review,5
Wait. Why wasn't the single counted? The umpire made an error. Why does the batting team have to suffer?,3
Gayle is the only 1990s player playing IPL. Enjoy him while he's here guys.,8
"I will never understand the dead ball concept . What if it’s the last ball, with batsman needing 1 or 2 runs to win . The ball is counted and because of umpire decision they are screwed .",4
What a brilliant review,2
"I think there was multitude of noises - bat hits ball, bat hits ground, ball hits boot. That is why batsman was not sure too and it was easy for umpire to get wrong.",2
Gayle left RCB to dissociate himself from Kohli's DRS curse,9
It doesn’t look like ball hit bat but there’s a sound.  Weird.  Bat is not on the ground either,2
This is what happens when commentators get over smart if it wasn’t for the replay he would have influenced people to think it was out,1
Saini: I hit batsmen one way or the other lol /s,2
"I hope just because Gayle succeeds now they don't make him bat at 3 always, it's still a shitty decision and might not work in bigger grounds",3
"Gayle at #3 is actually not a bad move. His modern game usually eats a lot of balls in the early stages whereas now he has a platform to settle in and accelerate if needs be. It's where Dhoni should bat too as well.


Clever.",5
"Hindi commentators ""Gayle celebrates singles"" 😒",16
"RCB is player dependent. No crazy ABD hitting, hence easy loss",5
KLPD running away with the cap,12
"When Kohli runs for Prime minister, don't vote for him or we'll have demonetization every year",12
RCB should not bowl Siraj again,9
RCB : We are sitting too comfortably at the top of the table. Time to fuck ourselves.,18
This match is fix. Looks like it's time IPL will somehow start becoming interesting.,-4
how to lose without fucking up the nrr?,10
Chris Gayle fucked all tactics of RCB. They are so focused on making all plans for him and forgot there is Mayank and Rahul.,11
"How is KL scoring runs in every match, dafuq",9
Would have been RCB's loss if Gayle has gone he is the only one trying to keep them in the game,-1
Rahul 50 off 37 and they need 50 off 37,5
That spike was a BC shout from Koach,16
"There's your lesson guys, never go all ga ga saying ee sala cup namdhe after back to back victories if you are an RCB fan.",12
[deleted],5
Last 6 overs & KXIP go screeeeechhhhh halt .... unless Universe Boss takes the chase in his hany,3
KL 50 off 37. KXIP needs 50 off 37.,15
Has universe boss ever run a double?,6

Why is Kumble showing off his thighs? I mean they’re pretty good. But cmon I’m tryna watch the game.,16
Bowl sundar you coward.,7
Gayle 22 (22).. this isn't the Gayle innings we were promised guys,9
Gayle is much fitter than last year this time. That is not saying something though.,1
Gayle looks like he has lost some weight,3
'Choke me daddy' mode?,-1
"Bowl yuzi u cowards, sundar will only limit runs now, u missed the pp window for that",3
"Well played KL, finish this, I don't trust other batsman. Pls my man",1
"Fuck , even Gayle runs better than Rayudu",4
"It is interesting to me that the ball on which lbw is given, is given as dot in case of not out. Let's say it is last ball of match, 1 to win. Umpire gives lbw, batsmen complete the run. They review, decision is overturned. Do we go to super over now?",3
The criticism of KL the anchor was a little harsh but not unwarranted if he is anchoring then it is his responsibility as the *anchor* to get them over the line. Granted the others are not contributing but the whole point of anchors are to see the team through the line. Thanks for attending my Ted Talk,2
If Gayle plays all matches. He will win at least 25% percentage of matches. Its the responsibility of other 10 to win 25 % of other matches.,3
If both KL and Gayle played at KL's current SR they're winning easily,3
Gayle walking that run lmao,3
"Man if Punjab are gnna win this, at least I want Gayle to smash and give us entertainment.",4
Just smash this in the next couple of overs,2

waiting for kings to throw this away,-1
Terrific point BrianLara the presence of Gayle in the dug out meant Kohli didnt use Washington Sundar with the new ball in the powerplay...no wonder selectdougout is  far better,11
"So what happens when a team needs 1 run off the last ball and they take a single but the fielding team takes a review just because they have one? Can the fielding team take a review even when the ball is hit for a six? Claiming that it hit the pad first? Will the runs not be counted then as well? 

I had these questions for a longgg time now, but only got around to asking here now.",9
"Kohli clapped for KL, wholesome, especially we all know how competitive Koach can get",11
"Kxip should have played this XI with cotrell instead of chris(in at least bowling pitches)from the start, maybe could have done better

Edit: Thinking about this, who tf thought gayle should be sitting out lmaooo",2
"Gayle waiting for spinners

His reflexes might be litl slow against real quicks

Sending him at 3 seems to be a really good move atm",6
"Keep Doing that Gayle, there's still Pooran and Maxwell to come",3
I want to know why koach tried to save ABD so much. Looking forward to his After match interview.,8
Even punjab won't bottle this. This game's done. I just want Gayle to hit a 25 run siraj over,6
"KXIP's role in every IPL is to be that team everyone counts as a certain victory against in their permutations and combinations but some of them miss playoffs after winning every game they needed to, except against KXIP",8
I see Kohli is leaving his star bowler till the very end. I still think the ATG Dube can pull it off here.,0
Red team sus 🤨,3
"Something Sunny G would say: ""If that had connected it would've landed in Abu Dhabi""",8

Beautifully dangerous to Watch but I dont wanna see them Getting out but they look so Uncomfortable every ball but they also hit sixes like eating cake😌😪😦",18

Is this good batting by Punjab or bad bowling by RCB or unpredictable Sharjah pitch?,5
So far only RDB and Ex-RCB batsmen have batted on this pitch today...,5
Why no chahal?,5

The stage is set for KXIP to fuck this up.,20
"Even the dude who believes strike rate is overrated scores fifty faster than Kohli. Man can stick his 6000ipl runs without a trophy to show for it, where the sun doesn't shine.",1
lol this must be sweaty palms moment for punjab again. they have lost from more promising positions.,8
Mark Nicholas was very proud of using Morris and Gayle's names like that. Good job there was an edge.,3
How did gayle degrade so much from his peak? Is it just his age or did teams figure out how to bowl for him.,-6
Can rahul touch that magical 973 record season of Kohli?,9
I can see KXP losing from here. They are shooting themselves in the foot!,5
I’ve started to enjoy the dugout commentary more than the games themselves,8
[deleted],8
Rahul after the match - strike rate is underrated.,14
Why do they usually make best batsman the captain of cricket teams? Virat Kohli seems to be a horrible tactician and a poor leader. Incredible batter but horrible strategist.,14
Will RCB drop Finch and Siraj? Please,11
[removed],7
Only Kings XI can lose it from here,8
Murali Kartik claiming Gayle wants pace LOL!! Do you even cricket bro??,8
RCB 4D chess to win the match by bringing KXIP to a winning position.,7
Ewwwww dugout bringing out friends reference. No please!,8
Really good from Gayle so far. First innings after a long time and played really sensible,6
"When I see Gayle's strike rate 100 after facing 20 balls----

Well how the turntables

My brother--Its 20-20 bro... the logic here is the year is 2020 and the game is twenty 20 so...",0
"Imagine if any other batsman was batting with 23 of 25

Power of universe boss",12
Fun fact all top 3 in today's game for KXIP played for RCB,11
If not for those last 2 overs. Match would have got over way before. Innit?,5
He is swinging wildly!,5
Again we're gonna take it to the deep bois,14
Think last 5 overs 45 will be tough on this pitch,5
Waiting for Punjab to perform a BJ(Bottlejob),5
Just like Sanju Samson even Gayle has a quota of couple of good innings before going shit.,5
KXIP got this in the pocket imo. Pooran is in good touch as well. Should be a cakewalk from here,4
I think there are more negatives of playing gayle than there are positives.,10
Scenes if Punjab lose this ...,8
"RCB shooting it's foot.


Struggling Kohli comes in at 3, in form AbD comes in at 6.


Koach's over-confidence is killing us today",10
RCB can still win this.,4
Gayle can easily hit 20 off last over. No problem,3
"I hope KXIP doesn't do anything stupid today, send Pooran next",4
A wicket now will be disastrous,4
Proper Match losing innings from Gayle,2
RCB has to bowl dube because KXIP are hitting spin ers well,5
When was the last time the bat hit the ball well?,2
"Gayle be like ""you haters can now stfu and suck on my 15 inch cock""",7
Saini got hit in 1 game and he is now no longer trusted to bowl at the death?,5
KXIP bottlejob status: loading,3
Both teams trying very hard to lose,6
Royals yesterday failed to make 39 off last 5. RCB still can win this given kings' struggles to finish this year.,4
Ducker took a single in the last ball,1
Gayle finding it harder to hit raw pace probably because of old age and declining eyesight.,3
It's crazy how quickly we all got used to this fake crowd soundtrack in the background. I remember finding it so annoying in the first match but now I rarely notice it.,6
Oh fuck. Siraj again,1
Punjab has lost all the matches from the verge of winning. Picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.,4
Brilliant spell by Saini,1
"Yes Scotty, You can never expect KXIP to win the game .",5
Have the Dhoni comparisons started yet?,2
Watching Gayle is finger biting level anxiety.. you know he can finish the game off in 3 balls but he just won't get going.,6
I still blame the management for not opening with gayle.,3
Siraj again? Brave,5
Kl retains the orange cap. Thank God 🙄,1
46 of 30 doesn't instill too much confidence tbh,3
Christopher Henry Morris is not even the best Christopher Henry playing this game. Sad.,2
RCB just need to take wickets and not give runs. That's it. Simple. Then they will win this.,1
Pressure building again. Boundaries needed,4
Is chahal gonna bowl at the death? What is going on here,2
Siraj Wtf,2
Siraj losing them the game lmao,5
Well time to hit or get out boss,3
Noooooooooo not SIRAJ!!!!!! PLEASE,3
"Those two sixes in the 13th over hurting RCB bad, 
Punjab would have needed around 50-55 runs in 30 balls otherwise",2
What if these two get out at this stage? This delaying stuff can backfire very easily.,2
not bringing spin against boss,3
"Now if Gayle Maxwell and Pooran start trying to hit every single delivery for a Six, they'll hit atleast 5 sixes between them and KL can make the rest. Why am i sitting on my couch i should be a Coach",4
"My dad still dissing KXIP, so we still have a chance",4
Why the fuck would you bowl lord siraj,3
"Rcb don't have control winning anymore

On the other hand kxip has full control of losing",5
Chahal won’t get the ball till gayle and pooran are out .,1
Saini in not constantly fast.,2
This gonna be bad,2
[deleted],6
"Can see Chahal getting an over and getting tonked for 20+

Lol never mind. Siraj is here",2
Why the hell is Siraj  bowling,1
7 from last 2 overs 👀👀,1
Both teams trying very hard to loose this game,2
"Oh, I see, we want to end the match this over.",1
Long and Hard - That's what sh..,1
oh boy here we go,1
I have a feeling Siraj is going to get cunted here.,1
This Siraj's over will close the game.,3
Wht tf Siraj,2
RCB is feeding siraj to Gayle,2
What in the actual fuck is siraj doing,1
"Kohli - let’s end the game now . 
Hands the ball to Siraj.",4
Did Koach just switch off his brain today?,4
Inb4 Siraj goes for 24.,2
 Why u giving Siraj? Gib Isuru Udana. I don’t want my boy to go after Siraj.,3
"I'm compiling a list of players who look like Ajinkya Rahane .. put your entries down below

1. Jaydev Unadkat",2
Gayle is just short of 10 sixes now for 1000 career T20 sixes.,3
Siraj proving why he's the leading bowler of Dinda Academy,6
Fuck you Siraj,3
Wtf Siraj again..GG lads,6
This over gonna kill the match,5
Y not udana?,1
Time for Finchy to sneak one over here (like he did in 2013 against Gayle),3
Why not udana. Why Siraj,4
Blunder over incoming,4
Siraj? Lmao,5
Someone please make Siraj retire hurt,4
Kohli. What the fuck is this. Why tf siraj. whyyy.,9
"Just after an economical over never ever give an over to a bowler going 12.5 in last two
.",2
Siraj will be taken for a ride this over,1
Lmao did Kohli just say “Yeh bc Phir kidhar Chala Gaya”,5
BC Lara 😁,3
That's what you call a *saav-adi*,3
Lord Siraj is on. Koach putting the game out of it's misery instead giving fans false hope..,6
And it begins...,5
"My very little hope, is now dead coz of siraj",8
I've seen this one before...,5
Kohli goes full BC after that 4,9
Kohli abusing siraj lol.,9
"The guy who wanted a 25 run Siraj Over , how do you feel rn ?",16
Damn Gayle went from hard hitter to anchoring innings. I have officially gone old.,8
I have feeling that KXIP will make RCB'S 2016 comeback,6
"People trashing Gayle in the match thread. Here you fucking go. No touches with no service, but when he gets it, it's done.",6
"Virat, what captaincy is this. Give it to udana. The fuck you take an intl bowler for",13
That sweet sound!! Damn,3
LET’S GO,5
Now bowling Siraj is gifting victory to KXIP,3
Gayle is the man!,1
"We need better statistics developed for t20s , something objective but useful",1
Siraj bowls middle overs as a pacer still not performs,1
Gayle I love you 😍,2
"I think I’ve underestimated RCB as a team but overestimated Kohli’s ability pull results from this team.

He doesn’t rotate his bowlers the way Karthik, Williamson or Dhoni does.",7
"Siraj over will kill the game

Rip",1
Umesh Siraj Yadhav,3
Hahah get fucked SIRAJ,1
Siraj 😠,2
For me Gayle is T20 GOAT,5
Siraj took off his mask to reveal it was Lord Siraj,3
Siraj is making RCB chances for winning look like a mirage,2
Rcb won't win a trophy under this captain.,6
Gayle's sr vs siraj is 270 lol,6
"Mark ""YES YES YES"" Nicholas",2
Dinda is a way better bowler than Siraj,2
Siraj you beauty!!!,1
KoAcH iS A gENiUs,1
I think kxip might choke and lose as usual.,3
Honestly there is only so much the bowlers can do when the total is low on a small ground,1
This just KOACH being KOACH,3
"171 was way too low a target in Sharjah, even for Punjab.",3
Gayle in his 80s also would have hit that,4
"Animated kohli at long off

.finally something normal",2
Please throw Finch away and let Philippe open and keep and let Abd freely bat without having to keep for 20 overs. Pleasee,3
C U N T E D,2
Wicket alert my foot,6
Only 11 runs off 2 balls. Much better than expected.,5
Lol there’s a special counter of gayle sixes,3
Even  Gully captain won't give the ball to siraj in this condition.,9
Bye Bye RCB,6
"Cmon, Morris should have bowled",6
"Awful from Siraj, wasting Saini and chahal’s efforts. Ffs man",5
Lod Siraj never disappoints.,8
I see myself in Siraj. Bowl a bit fast and shit.,5
That's the RCB i grew up with,9
Why siraj tho. Udana has 3 left.,7
Kohli shitty captaincy,3
You need to be OG to have a special counter for your sixes,1
Brain dead Kohli,3
i dont get it. Why is Siraj on ? Kohli has pretty dissapointing captaincy in this match.,2
Siraj with those hit me length balls,5
"Can any SJWs here help me. 

My friend said ""if only black people can say the n-word then only people with mental health issues can say the r-word""

How do I argue with this?",1
"I was about to type ""Peak Gayle would have murdered Siraj"". And he kills him anyway lol.",6
"This is what you get for bowling Siraj 

Well deserved",5
It's tough to decide who to shit on between Khaleel and Siraj.,3
"Phew! I would like for RCB to lose because of what they did to KKR.

Thanks Koach!",4
Gayle storm,2
National BoSS!!!,2
"Khol Khol ke gaand maar di hai, stupid decisions should be treated this way.",1
Why is Siraj being given another over? Udana is obviously better bowler than him. He is underutilized in every match...,2
Cricbuzz saying Siraj has been expensive today. Boi when has he ever been economical??,10
Its game over in this over lmao,6
"Well well well, two ex RCB players slaying RCB.......",8
Lord Siraj is back 😎😎,3
Why the fuck would you hold your spinners first and then give the overs to Siraj??!,3
"everyone talking about how Gayle is back   
but no ones talking about IPL Siraj being back :(",6
Siraj is shit even in 2020 timeline,1
Gayle continue cunting and get to a 50,3
Please let this be Siraj's last game in an RCB shirt.,1
Man such nice feeling seeing gayle bat,2
"Lord Siraj arriveth, RCB death bowling going shit again.",1
"Why Nehra keep peddling ""Yorker can't get wickets""😒",1
"*Lord is back*

When ever opposition is in short of boundaries lord bless them with few. such a lovely guy. I don't know why PPL don't like him",2
"Could've bowled anyone but Siraj. But no, you wanted to lose the match.",7
Mini-over time,3
"I don't see how siraj has bowled 3 overs, but Udana only one.",1
Time to shoot these bowler to the moon,1
RCB don't deserve to win today.,2
Lord Shitraj,2
Kohli why you hiding Chahal? Why not use your overseas player Udana?,2
THOU MAY HITETH ME HARD - Lord Siraj-ud-Daulah 2020,7
"In the post match presentation, when they ask Kohli what happened

Kohli: if i eated soap. I don't eat it bc I did. No I didn't",3
Did Udana bowl this match?,2
r/Cricket memed Siraj into form and then memed him back to a meme.,9
What's worse than watching our bowlers getting whacked is hearing Gavaskar orgasm after each shot,4
Not even kxip can bottle this,3
They’re not gonna use Chahal,6
"Morris and ABD pour their heart into this team, for what?!",12
"If anyone can fuck this match up from this position, it is KXIP",3
What else was Kohli expected out of Siraj?,6
Kohli's feeling how the opposition felt when batting with Gayle all these years.,12
Siraj is a hard worker. Puts effort. Koach likes such people.,9
Siraj instead of Udana at this stage is just handing the match away,6
Why is Siraj so bad. And why does he get chance after chance?,6
Dube would've been a better pick,3
I just love how everyone called Siraj to shit the bed and that's exactly what he's done. What a performer.,8
Swanny sucking off Newcastle now. Lol,4
Mark Nicolas leading rcb fans on,3
Nehraji getting orgasms  giving advice to siraj,8
Why on earth would you sign this muppet fuck drop him or shoot him to the moon,1
What is BIG DICK SIX! Pitaji Rahul!! What a playaa!,3
Fuck this is so awful,4
Man DC bowlers were killer defending in death overs yesterday,6
Siraj lost the game on his own,2
11 in 3 🤦‍♂️,3
Siraj is so god awful,6
"Like Yes Gayle hit a few sixes, but even neesham could have made a 30 ball 35",2

shit looking cricketer",6
"Kohli Asks Siraj to bowl 


Siraj bowls


Kohli : BC why you bowling like Siraj",7
Ee match devrige.,6
That ball forgot gravity existed for about 10 seconds,12
Siraj what is u doin,7
classy shot,2
Aaaaaaaannnnnnnddddd Siraj is bach,8
Siraj never disappoints just like RCB,10
I have said this before. Mann makes no contribution while Siraj makes -ve contribution,4
That's like the 10 th ball they had to replace.,3
"Siraj is Siraj, this is just awful captaincy for me",10
"I’d never understand Kohli’s obsession with Siraj, he is not a very good bowler",11
siraj needs to never bowl anotehr ball for rcb,9
Siraj making Lord Umesh proud.,6
Yes SIRAJ baby gimme more sixes,4
KL Rahul you beautiful ❤️👏🏽👍🏽,10
Watching KL Rahul bat honestly makes me happy.. such clean strokeplay,6
Siraj has Kohli's nudes,10
No I am not crying nooooo I am not crying,3
"Poor Siraj

I feel for him tbh",9
Lord Siraj is Back,8
Rahul you beauty,3
Punjab's next match is against MI no cover,5
My boy Siraj coming back to form!,7
"Siraj getting tonked. Finally, inner peace.",7
Siraj keeping the legacy of RCB bowling alive. Respect,6
Again poor captaincy from Kohli,5
"It's no fault of RCB, by bowling SirAJ they are just playing bold",8
Siraj closing in on his 50,6
Gayle is so much fun to watch bat,7
Punjab fans were scared before this over. They can rest easy now,1
Ra- Hulk😂👏🏽,5
Surely KXIP can’t lose it from here right?,5
KXIP will not lose now. Game's in pocket.,4
KL has taken a liking to Siraj,3
Glimpse of Rohit there,1
"Knowing my team, we might still fuck it up...",6
which one’s the meme team again?,4
Kohli completely missing the mark as a captain today all day. Truly shocking stuff.,6
"Ok, the RCB we know is back",2
"As kings 11 fan, we can still lose",3
"Kohli: our bowling is good this year.

Siraj: hold my beer",6
This is how easily RR could’ve chased yesterday,5
Why the fuck Kohli is keeping Chahal's 2 over when match itself is done. Pathetic captain with ego all over his body.,7
FFS RCB. You brought Gayle back to form in his first game. We still have one more game to play damn it.,5
Lord giveth and giveth slot balls,6
"The Mohammeds have been shit today, the Chris Henry’s have been OG",5
I need to see Jadhav vs Siraj xD,11

siraj lol,1
"Siraj ud Daula, rcb la jhowla",2
KXIP can you please fuck us slowly? our nrr is already bad :(,7
Poor guy Siraj. Everyone goes after him.,5
Lord Umesh died for this,5
Kohli and rcb team management thinking why did they let rahul and Gayle go,5
Can I safely say that we will win from here.,3
I was wondering how long it was going to take for the Siraj selection to backfire.,7
Man Rahul is pure quality,3
This was the time for experiments. Rcb should now realise these experiments didn't work and stick to the winning plan.,7
Love it! But gotta think why not Udana?,6
Siraj has KL and Gayle in his Dream 11 team.,8
Guys do you think Punjab can win /s but also not /s,5
Tbh feeling sad for siraj.... He might get hit for runs but he is a decent bowler!?,5
Lord Siraj has ascended. Everyone's a gangsta until Siraj gets into peak form.,3
"KL , why'd you play that shot?

KL: Aise hi Sexy lag raha tha 

T: Meh, was feeling sexy",0
"okay, my tin foil hat is on, but is Kohli intentionally loosing against KL ? that's the only way to explain this",3
"LORD SIRAJ, BACK AT IT AGAIN",3
"I think Kohli was feeling bad for both KLPD and Boss, so he gifted them Siraj...what a nice bloke",3
Kxip with an excess of keepers and rcb with a deficit of keepers,1
0-42 in 2.4. Our siraj is back baby,6
"Can we trade this chutiya for someone before the next game? Oh wait, no one is gonna buy him.",5
"41 year old past his prime who hasn't played a game since Jan is rescuing his team that is rapidly sinking this IPL against his former team.

Legend! GOAT!!",9
We deserve to lose this match. Siraj getting 3 overs ffs,9
yall punjab fans asking who yall will get into form when actually we're getting you guys into form,2
What a fucking dumbass captain,10
Game over...KXIP need Gayle for the intimidating factor alone,3
"Strange tactics? Or some sort of match fixing? Who knows, probably the former since RCB can't help but be the meme team",9
I want to talk to Kohli Captaincy defenders now... Please stand up..,14
I feel this match gonna mentally affect kohli the captain,8
"Siraj: gets whacked in first 3 balls

Kohli: tera baby over hai, kisi aur ko ball de",18
This loss is on kohli. Absolutely brain dead.,21
Imagine thinking Siraj will not go for runs lmao,11
RaHuL iS pLaYiNg FoR oRaNgE cAp,17
Need another 6 for me to feel comfortable,2
"Koach - slow 48(39) in sharjah.
             - sundar and dubey before abd.
             - chahal in powerplay
             - bowling siraj when our designated death bowler udana has 3 
               Overs.
Fucking genius.",21
Has Gayle slimmed down? He looks bit leaner.,4
No BJ today from Punjab,2
"*sees visibly frustrated Kohli near the boundary cursing everything and everyone*


Ahh, some sense of normalcy restored",11
Have enough confidence in life as much as kohli as in siraj,9
Siraj is increasing his pace but sacrificing his accuracy. He wasn't this fast last year.,7
"Shami : I conceded 24 runs in an over

Siraj : Hold my headband",8
"Happy KXIP is winning but lmao this is pretty bad captaincy. Why would you bowl Siraj after 2 good choke overs. Come on Koach, India ain't getting a cup like this",12
Jeez. That as such an effortless six. Rahul can be so fun to watch when he’s in form,11
Kohli sad. Me sad,2
"Mandatory 20, run siraj over",4
Nets pe toh perfect yorkers pad rahe the? And Kohli was really happy in that video.,6
Holding back Chahal for death is so dumb when opposition has 9 wickets left.,3
Why is Siraj even bowling?,6
Chris Gayle was really our emotional spine han,1
Siraj LOL,3
"No Lord Umesh? No problem. 

Here, we give u Lord Siraj. 

- Koach",11
Kohli right there was the epitome of surprised pikachu face.,11
It still blows my mind that Siraj plays for an IPL team,11
What's with this MI vs KKR hype when we all know it'll be one of those boring marches,2
Siraj has kohli's nudes,17
You need overs from Rabada and Nortje to win this,6
RCB gonna choke after this match.,6
Just Siraj things,3
"What was the need to bowl Siraj now ?

Saying it for the first time, Kohli is a pretty bad Captain. Rohit should lead in T20i and ODI",8
Please give him the 4th over so he can get a 50,5
damn RCB dead,2
The only team that could fuck this up from here is Punjab.,4
KOHLI is a shitty captain,8
Let me repeat - It will never not be funny watching Siraj getting tonked,5
Yeah we get 2nd win atleast now ??,0
Siraj is my dream 11 captain 😎😎😎,13
just bowl chahal and end my misery,7
Kohli pleading with Siraj there...lol,7
"Something tells me Siraj will get dropped next match, RCB's 3rd bowler will get tonked again and they'll mess up the good start they got.",2
Timing beats strength. This is why I'll take beautiful touch batsmen over your muscle bound sloggers every time.,5
RCB batters never got length balls like that to hit. Except in last over,2
I am still telling to myself that we'll choke. Don't get your hopes up,4
"Kohli: Gayle bro, I'm sending a welcome gift your way...for old times' sake.

And in walks Siraj.",11
"So 2 udana overs, 1 navdeep and one morris",3
Puts Rajasthan’s embarrassing performance in perspective,6
Horrible captaincy from Kohli and even worse bowling from siraj,17
"Please koach 19th over to Siraj, pleaseeeeeeeeee.",14
VK to Siraj : kab khoon khaulega re tera Siraj? Aur kitne maar khaoge? 🤬,5
Unpopular: Umesh > Siraj,10
He's a spiceee boi that Viral Kilo,3
Just baffling captaincy from Kohli to say the least. Just baffling. Nothing else.,6
Siraj should retire,7
Very important strategic timeout. Gotta play all the ads now,7
This over was a prime example of why Koach is a shitty captain in limited overs cricket and he can't hide behind the excuses of not having good bowlers or playing at Chinnaswamy this time.,6
It all adds up to SRH and CSK.,2
Kohli to Siraj: Are you fucking sorry?,8
Koach why u du this?,3
Siraj - why do timeouts exist?,3
Lol board showing D/L par score in the middle of the desert.,4
"Kohli is just experimenting guys... it’s not like do a do or die match for them they can afford it.
How else will Siraj, Shivam Dube get more confidence?",3
What if KXIP's only wins against us only that will be quite a voodoo,5
"Does Kohli have an issue with Udana? He doesn’t seem to trust him as much. If he was brought as a death bowler, then why not trust him more.",5
UDANA HAS THREE FUCKING OVERS LEFT KOHLI U CUNT,11
Kohli returning favour to Siraj for serving biryani at his house,1
Kohli begging to Siraj to bowl to the field is the funniest thing I have seen today.,7
This is so good to watch,1
"I'm still getting Vietnam flash backs, just get the job done",4
RCB is the most inconsistent team in IPL ever! They have both the highest and lowest scores in the IPL and they lose twice to the last team in the points table.,11
Not bowling sundar during the powerplay have them the momentum which costed rcb the match,9
Even match and vs kkr. Is it gonna be nohit or brohit tomorrow ?,4
Poor decision from Koach. Why is Siraj bowling 16th over? He should be bowling 18th and 20th for maximum meme potential,13
Saving Udana's overs for the next match?,16
[deleted],4
"I'll phonepe RCB, don't take siraj.",6
I really feel this whole thing is goddamn scripted.. And we dumb cunts are playing along with this shit show,-1
"Siraj take a bow man. Love the way you dont ever change. 20 the over.

Keep koach's nudes save with you. You will play forever.",8
"Kohli having an absolutely shocking game is just too good honestly, never gets old.",5
"**Most Wickets taken by team in middle overs (7-16) in this season**

DC - 24

CSK - 22

RCB -21

MI - 21

SRH - 19

RR - 16

KKR - 15

KXIP - 12",5
"Talk about throwing matches. With a normal batting order and AB's form on this pitch, RCB would've easily had 15 more runs on the board and won this match.   

At least the Siraj experiment should be over after this. Shivam Dube was way better with his dibbly-dobblies.",4
Koach gets all stressed while facing Kumble's team. Must be guru dakshina of some sort.,9
There should be an appreciation  post for dhawans captaincy seeing virats today 😔,9
Same script for RCB every year.,4
"Koach: this ball is not swinging.
Siraj: Let me get rid of it.",10
Still not comfortable with KXIP in this situation. Somehow we'll blow it.,6
"Rcb should play

Prathiv
Padikkal
Virat
Abd
Ali
Morris
Dube
Sundar
Udana
Saini
Chahal

This will make them very balanced and dangerous.",2
Negi would provide better balance to RCB than Siraj.,2
Even Umesh is better. What is this,1
Imagine having seven bowling options and still going to Siraj for the third over,21
Why do these bowlers give short balls as if they have the pace of someone like a Shoaib Akhtar.Siraj at his pace is just asking to be hit.,2
"Hello darkness my old friend, it's good to see you back again",6
So basically RCB is telling KXIP and the whole world there is only one RCB and that's us :),9
Well i guess that's the last we will see of Siraj this season,1
Siraj's best format is first class cricket but I get the feeling his limited overs failures will ruin his test chances (its stupid yes I know but classic India selection),8
No Padikkal 30+ no win.,7
"For all his fireworks, Gayle has a strike rate of 116. Lol",6
Imagine KXIP throwing this match from here...,4
"Siraj is just not suited to T20s. 4-0-50-0, or close to it, is his analysis match after match. Worst part is, he hasn't improved even 1% after all these years.

Don't see him playing again for RCB after this game.",4
Lord Gayle is back,3
"I'm sorry guys, I shouldn't have watched Inside Edge on Prime. Any strange tactics makes me think you know what.",5
"When someone verbally assaults you on reddit for speaking ill about Kohli captaincy - show them this match...

He was and is a shit captain... period...",4
Siraj mate bowling every ball in the slot doesn't work in t20 cricket. When will he learn it's not a Ranji match ffs,3
"I just looked at the RCB squad, and if they need an Indian pacer to pair with Navdeep, its either Umesh/Siraj.  Everyone else is a domestic spinner or foreign pacer. Kohli simply has no other option.",1
I hope Kohli doesn’t pull out the “dimension” excuse today.,2
This group - any bowler who gets hit is bad. Any batsman who doesn’t score at over 150 sr is bad .,1
Udana is a good death bowler with 3 overs left,4
Imagine losing to Punjab... TWICE.,10
It's not Siraj's fault. It's Kohli. WHY DOESNT HE LEARN.,15
"Some of the tactics used by RCB tonight are going to be questioned later. Sending AB at 6, not giving Sundar an over in the powerplay and giving Siraj 3 overs when you have a perfectly good foreign pacer.",11
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN PLAY SIRAJ,7
Udana is injured or something? Why are you even playing him?,1
"There were three overs of Udana, two of Chahal, two of Sundar and one of Morris left, but they went for the Siraj on the 15th. An RCB own goal yet again.",4
King XI have the capability of being the 3rd seed but have choked 3 times :(,5
"Punjab gets all 4 points in the table from Bangalore.


Every other team has beaten Punjab till now",9
"Stupid to see RCBians put all the blame on Siraj. You have 2 overs of Chahal, 3 overs of Udana, 1 over of Morris, and 1 over of Sundar. That’s 7 overs. 

Stop acting like your captain and management didn’t botch up their strategies.",39
Aur khilao Siraj chutiye ko bc.Kohli just doesn't learn and then wonders why they don't win the title.,5
Get Umesh Yadav in for that donkey,1
Siraj won't even get sold on big billion day,7
Siraj getting confused whether to play for RCB A or RCB B,3
Kohli is damn lucky he is not in front of fans at the Chinnaswamy tonight.,11
Siraj is a solid player ngl just maybe not for white ball,3
100% should of played Gayle earlier on in the tournament,2
Gayle helps the balance of the side immensely. Have a 3rd top order option that you can trust so you can attack in the middle while still being able to hold back Pooran and Maxwell.,2
Chris Gayle will still be smacking 6s in his 60s.,6
His face is so punchable :),1
Punjab can still lose from here,3
What did Kohli expect from Siraj,2
"Rcb always challengers, never champions",2
That over was an exhibition of where not to ball in this format,4
"Siraj has gotten 44 in 18 balls. That's impressive.


Oh fuck, it's his bowling figures",9
Gayle won't be taking this to batdeep ™️,2
"You’d think this is a perfect pitch for Udana’s bowling , but no, they don’t do logical stuff over at RCB",2
"Post match ""Kohli why all this experimental shit this match?""

Kohli ""We wanted to test our bench strength. We fell short by 15-20 ~~runs~~ ***IQ*** points"".",6
RCB self inflicted wounds,1
"Just a little disappointed that Kohli has denied Siraj his rightful, well deserved half century to join his other mates",2
on the plus side i really hope this helps kxip make a comeback into the tournament,3
"ABD at 4 is a beast, let’s fuck up the order. Washington gives you 4 tight powerplay overs, let’s fuck that up. RCB back in the game with 2 tight overs from Saini and Morris, let’s give the ball to Siraj",3
Chahal should have bowled,2
No one should be allowed to wear this headband it’s a curse,3
How do the cameramen know when umpires give the timeout sign? Are they informed beforehand?,2
"It baffles why RCB didn't take an extra spinner for this kind of pitch. They should have taken Negi instead of Siraj. Well, It's easy to suggest anything now.",1
Wooden spoon holders RCB beat KXIP twice last year so it’s only fair for RCB to return the favour this year,3
Timeout just to hide siraj's body,5
"please fuck us slowly KXIP, we are your brothers. our nrr is already bad :(",5
I still think we should probably play neesham over Jordan,1
"I don’t really get this gameplan from RCB? Why try and fix what’s not broken? If you want to test out other batsman, there are plenty of games when you can do that. Don’t compromise on your best batsman when you’re still not qualified for the play offs. Sundar was one thing but I don’t know why they had Dube come before AB. Then when they started bowling they didn’t bowl sundar when he does best. Strange",2
Pls take it to the last over at least.,2
I love you gayle i missed you,1
god damn thats massive,1
WHATTTE SIXXXXX,2
Wtf is Sundar at the death????,3
People are being too tough on Siraj. All set KL Gayle looking to go big would have scored 20+ to anybody,1
"Mallya needs more bail money, only explanation for Koach's  weird decisions today",3
O. Wow,2
YES GAYLE,2
Just so fucking effortless,5
Cheat code : BIGBAT,3
"Horrible horrible over, but mentally it gets harder and harder to defend subpar totals because the batsmen derive so much confidence from the low asking rate. Siraj could have bowled an 8 run over there and KXIP would still be in control. This loss falls basically solely on the RCB batsmen, and to be honest, mainly on Kohli.",3
CSk not penalized for fairplay points,4
That ball went to Washington,7
Now Gayle is just toying with bowlers,9
"I know it seems like a boring end to the game

But its kxip vs rcb. There has to be twists.",9
This guy never runs out of sixes!,4
Lmao counting the fuck ups k11 would have 8-10 points,3
Get C U N T E D,2
Priety is such a cutie 😍,1
Sundar sent to Washington by Gayle,2
"Gayle gonna destroy the economy of sundar, koach has no sympathy",1
"**Chris Gayle vs Mohammad Siraj**

*Before today*

Runs - 43

Balls - 16

4s - 5

6s - 3

SR - 268.8

*Today so far*

Runs - 12

Balls - 5",5
Omg Zinta is happy!!😍😍😍 I am happy too!!!,3
excuse me why isn't chahal bowling,2
Sundar had an economy rate of 4.91 coming in. Got Universal Bossed around.,5
This is comical,4
We made it boys!! We bought Gayle and Punjab in form.,4
Why the fuck would you hold your spinners this late? They are supposed to be the ones to take wickets and apply pressure in the middle.,2
"Mohammed Siraj ain't barking that much tonight. Jokes apart, who would have thought Christopher Henry Gayle will show us how to bat in the middle order in the second inning on an ever slowing Sharjah wicket.",3
"Gayle's sixes vs Gayle's peepee, which is longer?",2
Why the fuck is sundar bowling? Why not udana,3
Scott styris eating his hat rn. The number of times he said gayle shouldn't play.,2
"Technically, RCB is unbeaten today. 

Losing to yourself, RCB V1.0 doesn't count.",4
Gayle. Making me eat my words,1
Niceee nrr once again to go back to the gutter. Thanks a lot Gayle,6
u benched this legend😔,2
"Gayle,yess🔥",2
He will finish it this over,2
"The batting position of the trio of Mayank, KL and Gayle is irrelevant*.

*-> As long as they're scoring runs/winning.",5
"Gayle you beauty, kxip seriously lacked Gayle firepower",7
Spinner to Gayle. LOL,5
And they kept him out of the team for first 7 games,10
"SuNdAr WaS hElD bAcK fOr GaYlE

Ffs play your own strength",7
Hope RCB rectify their mistakes. WTF was this match? Shit Strategy.,2
Let’s bowl a spinner in death overs against Gayle- Kohli probably,2
Fuck this shit,5
Rcb never knew how to face gayle. Its not their fault.,3
How is KXIP batting sensibly? It doesn't make any sense.,4
WHY TF GAYLE WAS NOT PLAYING FROM GAME ONE??,3
"The comments here went from 

Is AB injured ???

Is Sundar Injured ???

Is Udana Injured ??? 


Me : First time watching a RCB game huh ?",14
bruh,1
Gayle destroying RCB and RCB fans😂😂😂,12
"Unless RCB used this a match just to experiment, the decisions used today are just confusing and stupid",7
Kohli's tactics were shit today..big deal...better he learns from his mistakes now than in the playoffs,12
Effortless,4
Hot damn the storm really hit RCB,7
"Gayle’s like “I’m bored, let’s get this over with and grab some dinner”",9
"Gayle just doing a Gayle, this is unfair",5
For the next match drop Finch and Siraj for Ali and Partiv,2
"I really want KXIP to do well. Gayle, Maxwell, Pooran, Zinta...they used to have Miller too. All round wonderful team.


If I had my way I'd have MI (Tendulkar and Ponting opening was just beautiful), KKR (Morgan), RR (England FC) and KXIP in the playoffs every year.",2
Fuck it. We won. Finally,4
Zintaaa!,7
41 y/o still hitting 96m sixes,9
Gayle and Sharjah..what can go wrong,6
Why isn't Chahal bowling?,2
Net run rate fucked again,2
Kumble benching Gayle for 6 straight games un-fing-believable,5
Yeah why do we suck??? Why are clowns like Siraj still on the team???,3
😭😭😭😭,4
I’m an RCB fan but I can always watch Gayle bat,7
I don’t care about the score just give me a Kohli cam after every six.,4
RCB mystery spinners getting their asshole ripped bigger than the size of Russia,3
RCB got thoroughly humiliated by kxip in both their matches,7
Imagine benching this man for half the tournament. Peak ~~RCB~~ KXIP thing to do.,7
"Kohli captaincy is back  

- Siraj pies given overs over Chahal  
- Powerplay over bowling in the death  
- Death bowler not bowling  
- Best batsman not betting for 16 overs",11
lmao kohli you dickhead i was kidding,3
They’ll finish the game in the 18th over to bring RCB’s NRR crashing down again,5
This match is going to end sooner than expected,2
Man sundar had less than 5 economy rate what happened lmao,8
What made them bench UB all this time I still cannot get.,3
Siraj's bowling technique involves him just running in and throwing the ball as hard as he can without bowling a wide. Literally one of the worst pace bowlers I've ever seen. I don't understand how he keels ending up in our team. Or any competent team for that matter..,2
Gayle making it seem like eating cake lmao,4
"Had to get Hindi commentary because of my dad, can somebody strangle Nehra for me please",2
SANJAY :- *gayle ka balla bilkul tel lagake aiya hua hai*,6
Bye bye NRR,3
"Stop shitting on Siraj guys. It is Chris Gayle. You can't expect him to not go after the weak link. If it was not Siraj, it would have been someone else.",3
Lol not bowling Sundar early on to get smashed later.,2
I hope Gayle doesn't destroy Sundar's confidence for the rest of the IPL.,2
"Uh oh Gayle spanking Sundar, he didn't conceded singe six in the tournament now he is being hit all over",3
has something happened to udana?,1
Why he is shouting catch ?,1
"You monster, Gayle you beauty",3
This is entertaining now,1
Now this looks like personal revenge against Washington,3
NOW WHO TF DIDNT LET GAYLE PLAY FRON THE START,7
Doesn't look real,1
DON'T BLUSH BABY,3
Big Black Man blows little boy.,4
"Since she's not a cricketer, I think mods will be ok with this. I really wanna date Preity Zinta.",4
Staahpp they ded already!!!,4
Gayle is now just flexing.,2
"The way he's fucking Sundar 
He should be called Chris Gay",5
gayle is great and all but i cannot enjoy this,3
Chokers fest with a beautiful ending 😍😍😍 I’m loving it,2
"Koach : ""tHe pItCh wAs SlOw mUh 48(39) sO vAluAbLe.""",9
Feels good to see the boss in full flow,1
Kohli should’ve stuck to what worked. 2017-19 Kohli was back today with those decisions.,3
"These commentators have such great chemistry, love hearing them have fun",1
RCB back to being the MEME kings.,6
Kohli watching helplessly,5
I don’t even blame Washington. He’s a powerplay bowler,6
Memed gayle back into form. Lmao,3
  I N T E N T,1
"And, fans get triggered when people question Koach's captaincy and say Rohit is better!",4
Gayle is here to humiliate his little mistress RCB,3
"Hot Take- RCB underestimated KXIP by experimenting with their winning strategies. Not any specific player's fault, straight up weird tactics in both the innings",2
For those dimples 😍😍😍,6
Lovely lovely sixes.,3
Gayle reminding RCB of their past glory :),4
"Watching KXIP win would be surreal. Until the winning run I would keep thinking there's got to be a twist, they are going to bottle this up. It's like an episode of scooby doo where the monster was actually a monster. Or a movie by M Night Shyamalan where the twist is that there is no twist",3
Kohli chutiye tejh throw fekne se kuch nahi hoga.,1
[deleted],6
[removed],-14
Kxip management brainstorming how to lose from here,7
Getting spanked by 41 year old Gayle is peak RCB,7
BOSS IS BACK BABYYY,0
"Gayle looks like he wants to prove a point to everyone on field, RCB for dropping him and KXIP for not selecting him until today lol",5
Udana ko hilane ke liye liya kya bc,2
"NRR which was slowly climbing: Aight, imma head out",3
Gayle Maar Raha Hai,3
Gayle >> Pooran,1
"Surely, we can't lose from here, right? RIGHT?!",7
Why the hell they would keep on playing maxwell and keep him benched all this time?,3
Man of the match -  Virat Kohli,3
KXIP single handedly ensuring that RCB's NRR remains negative throughout the tournament,6
[deleted],-20
Why is udana in team when he is not gonna bowl.. strange captaincy today from rcb,7
Gayle doesn't like game to take deep. Just get done with it fast so he can have beer soon.,3
OMG! OMG! OMG! Daddy Gayle please,7
Fucking Gayle goes brr. But feeling sad for sundar tho he is not an final over bowler fucked up his average and his confidence. Kholi should wait for Saini and Morris at the final more .,4
Thanks siraj :),4
From all CSK fan a big thank you to KXIP for bringing down RCB's NRR.,8
Gayle 50 let’s goooo,2
Fucking abysmal,3
Kohli wins 2 games and thinks he is Sun Tzu.,31
Kohli bhai kya soch rhe the aaj captaincy krte hue -_-,4
gayle is the true goat of the ipl,6
The new meme team defeats old meme team,10
"Gayle

Agarwal

Rahul

Maxwell

Pooran

This would be an unstoppable batting order, especially if everyone is given license to attack. Just horrible strategy letting them reach this point as by far the worst team in the competition",17
Gayle show is such an insult to Rahul and Kumble. You need to take your chances with matchwinners like Gayle.,11
Gayle is Mr. IPL. Just so enjoyable to watch,8
"I've been informed that Christopher H Gayle has opened up a Cameo account. This means you can get him to say whatever you want for around $200 for a 15-20 second video. We must open a r/cricket superpack to raise the required funds to hire Mr Gayle to produce memes to placate this forum's appetite. Mods, pin this.",9
"Chris gayle off field 🤣😁

Chris gayle while batting 🤨😐",18
The one doing the camerawork needs to sacked. It is so   inaccurate,4
Aw yes can't not celebrate Gayle's fifty,3
"Gayle be like, lemme remind you all of who I am!",6
RCB deserve this for not making a single right decision tonight.,7
Universe boss 🔥🔥🔥🔥,2
**GAYLE STORM** is here!!,3
"Kumble's only request to his team "" just win against kohli""",13
Sundar's medium pace bowling got the treatment,2
"Said it before and I'll say it again -

It's RCB DNA^tm. 

Their bowling is way too fragile",8
"Thank you, universe boss",5
God I feel like a right mug picking Pooran as my captain now,5
CHRISTOPHER HENRY GAYLLLEEEE🇯🇲,6
Love me some Gayle,3
Gayle played well at 3. Who would’ve thunk?,4
"Screw the haters man. I'm going to miss KP in the comms box. 

Hope they have a good replacement coming.",7
Just when RCB had managed to bring their NRR to some respectability Punjab fuck it all up with a clinical chase.,3
"Sundar bowling brilliantly in power play. Bowling unit performing well without Umesh, without Siraj in the team.

Koach - Hmm. Wait.",2
If Gayle is Universe Boss then I must be a Universe Slave,6
KP jizzing all over,1
Why is sundar bowling so fast on a slowing track?,1
who's the kxip chick waving the flag? asking for a friend,8
The Boss™,8

T20 Bradman,2
"KL Rahul, Agarwal and Gayle in the same team should be illegal. Lol",2
4 off 12 and now a 35 ball 50,7
Gayle got 50. WTF magic was that.,8
Respect for Gayle!!,5
T20 goat,8
All hail the king,3
Happy to see Priety Zinta Happy 😊😊☺😇😇,7
Happy to see Gayle get runs.,8
"The loss is on Kohli, shitty captaincy all around.",7
Please VK let Siraj complete his 50,7
"ABD bats best at 4 fuck it, Sundar bowls best in pp fuck it, Chahal bowls best in middle overs fuck it, Udana can variate ball a bit let's give to lord siraj, once again fuck.
What a brain fade match this has been for Koach.",12
kholi trusts siraj more than udana,2
"You masterclass Gayle, man never ever drop Gayle from your side ever",1
This is why koach doesn't do the khelo dimag se ads.,7
THE UNIVERSE BOSS BABY,5
RCB lost it completely tonight. And I need to stop playing that damn Dream 11. It's so addictive! I haven't spent money on it yet and won a couple games so I had balance to play small leagues. But I get so frustrated whenever I don't win like yesterday and today.,7
The fact that you all doubted gayle is so sad,7
Universal Boss,5
"What a sweet, sweet comeback from Gayle. Never doubt the Universe Boss!",6
Some of the Preity comments on here are really sexist and kinda disgusting.,4
Lmao Gayle's 50 (36) has been the most effortless half century at that strike rate i've ever seen,13
Kinda amazing to see Gayle dominate like this at 41.,4
Can we call Gayle goat for t20s?,9
"Motm: Siraj

Edit: wow this r/agedlikewine",3
"Imma be honest. Just when I start rating RCB well, their strategies make me hella mad.",7
RCB players tonight be like: Dead body reported 💀.,2
RCB playing for the brand.,3
Boss is back,3
Dugout cheering gayle like proud parents. I am almost teary.,4
If it ain't broken...,8
The swag on this guy is unreal,7
I will be honest.  It was really satisfying to watch Gayle humiliate RCB,10
Love koach lookin at those sixes helplessly.,4
Gayle <3,3
Why is KP leaving ?,3
Match losing? No but my man Gayle hitting us out of the ground hurts the most :),5
koach was super bad tonight,5
"Why Siraj, why Sundar? When you have Udana, Chahal Saini, Morris, and worst case even Dube...",2
I don't mind us losing if Gayle smacks 2 sixes and finishes off the game,8
What will BC Kohli do with Chahal's 2 remaining overs,6
Hope they don't repeat this.,6
"The Boss - He never left, Binga",12
Ex RCBians showing gratitude,9
RCB thought they had finally got their bowling in order only to get whacked around by a 41 year old recovering from food poisoning.,24
Dugout gave standing ovation to universal boss.,11
Kohli must be regretting releasing Gayle. Serves him well.,12
"Hearing 71 years old Gavaskar utter  the words ""universe boss"" is not something i never thought I'd hear.",20
MAN THEY'RE GIVING HIM STANDING OVATION IN DUGOUT,9
And 2020 returns back to normalcy with the boss correcting the Universe,16
Universe Boss > Universe Koach,12
Gayle's showing the front of the bat and the cameraman is showing everything but that,11
"Sundar conceded a grand total of one six before today

Got hit by four today by Gayle",8

What happened next will not surprise you!",13

"Gayle scores a 50:

Commentators: *gets off their chairs and start clapping*

Rahul, carrying the whole bloody team, gets nothing after scoring his 50: **am I a joke to you?**",20
"Thanks Kohli and RCB, from Hyderabad",9
50 for the universal boss..,4
Was Hoping for a De Villiers’s show. But RCB’s retarded strategy ruined that. But nice to see Universe Boss comeback.,16
"Man we seriously need more of such characters in cricket. 

What a legend.",31
KXIP should imagine every team as RCB.,9
RCB shot themselves in the foot by not bringing in AB and let him play himself in and not continue with Sundar in Powerplays where he's been so good.,13
Bc washi's brilliant economy got wrecked :(,15
Gayle has quietly shown a middle finger to RCB for dropping him,9
Baap baap hota hai. Massive respect.,3
"Fuck it, koach. Just bowl an over and end this.

I know you can take KL and Gayle wickets , just bowl",9
Chris Gayle is tailor made for Sharjah. Why they didn't play him before still befuddles me.,6
KXIP is RCBs misery this IPL,7

Preity Zinta is so pretty it hurts,12
Mad props to Gayle for the way he paced his innings. T20 legend.,6
FUCK YOU KOHLI,2
I'll take this loss happily if it means Siraj gets benched,8
"lmao ""thats him saying the universe is upside down""",3
Why did they send AB down the order?,4
"Smile all you want, he's already got your team's number",2
"sixes are so easy to come by in Sharjah, gayle and rahul have hit 5 each. weird for rcb to play tuktuk till the 19th over.",9
Damn I didn't tune into this game thinking kxip will get walloped as usual. Thanks Kxip very cool!!,2
"I feel Ab also shud leave RCB n get in Kxip

Atleast we ll seem him at top order",4
"I’m not watching RCB play till they get a proper middle order. Gurkeerat, Parthiv, Moeen are sitting out for Finch to nervously walk down the pitch every match",1
Chris “thanos” Gayle: i will shred this bowling lineup down to it’s last atom.,6
RCB gonna pull a KXIP 2018 now,5
If only Punjab played the next 6 matches against RCB.,8
Kohli thought he was saving Sundar for Gayle but it was the other way round.,4
RCB kicked out Gayle from their team? Lol😂,3
KP is truly the Donald Trump of cricket,7
RCB just disintegrating here,3
Rcb gave  redemption for kxip,1
"Universe Boss, well deserved title",9
How to play Sundar- with a straight fucking bat. Thank you Christopher Henry Gayle. It's always been the Caribbeans who have exposed him. In previous years Narine had also blasted Sundar.,10
How many times will the commentator mention Christopher Henry this over?,5
Gayle is truly *SSOB EHT*,6
"KXIP has requested IPL Committee to add two more matches against RCB, so that they won't end up last in table",10
I think I’m the only one who likes KP’s commentary. He’s genuinely quite funny,3
All spiners showing off their economy untill the universal boss showed up,2
absolutely love seeing Gayle bat,4

RCB usually lose to everyone and beat KXIP.,9

Slater: maniac laugh",8

"Who's that girl in KXIP staff with a beautiful smile?
Not Preity Zinta, the other one.",0

Gayle showing ""The boss"" on his bat, AB and Finch behind",27
ssoq ǝɥ┴,13
"With Universe Boss in form, other teams will lose and RCB will qualify. 4D chess",5
Why is Gayle not playing for CSK. They sure need a hitter in that team.,4
The thing is even RCB fans won’t be surprised if RCB doesn’t qualify for the playoffs this time,11
Honestly if CSK go for Gayle next auction I wouldn't even be mad.,15

KP loving Gayle's sixes😅👍🏽,3
The greatest batsmans both on strike and behind the stumps. The time' they play together should be cherished considering both may retire in a few years.,9
Even if RCB win a season they’ll never be a great team like MI or CSK unless Kohli leaves. Takes too many bad decisions.,14
The day RCB / DC / KxiP wins the ipl... will be the day when i'll think IPL is truly fixed.,-1
[deleted],16
Lol that’s hilarious him pouting to the boss upside down,3
Im still rooting for RCB I'm crazy,2
Next match Phillipe in place of Finch and anyone at all in place of siraj,4
Kumble can now sleep happy even if Kings don't win any games from here on. His team beat Koach's team twice....twice the pleasure.,19
"Lol KXIP's may only get 2 wins this year, and they'll both be against RCB. Gayle's revenge!",10
I swear KXIP only bring Gayle out every year to wreck RCB lmao.. he scored 99 against RCB last year as well,11
RCB really likes to throw away the momentum.,5
"**Chris Gayle** now has 10,000 runs coming via boundaries (1027 fours & 982 sixes) in Twenty20 cricket.

Gayle And RCB Back To Form.,1
/u/TheDceuGuy deleting the comment isn't enough you racist fuck,11
Gayle was the missing piece.,8
Some dodgy tactics from RCB today.,8
"Its like Punjab collects all old RCB players

Rahul,Mayank, Gayle, Sarfaraz, Mandeep, Jordan.

&#x200B;

Take Siraj and Umesh too",26
Doull not mentioning Ibrahimovic in sportsmen talking about themselves in third person should be banned from ever commentating.,8
I don’t understand why Siraj is still on the side,3
KP such a fun character honestly,0
"That's the thing with RCB. Out of 5 wins, they barely won 3 of them. The three games that they have lost(assuming this one too), they have been absolutely thrashed! (2 of them against the bottom-most team)",4
16D chess by RCB so that KXIP will play Gayle and that'll help other teams. Good guy RCB,6
"Previously on r/cricket:

KXIP fans: Bring in Gayle. He’ll solve everything 

Non-KXIP fans: KXIP’s problem is bowling ffs! Stop asking for Gayle",15
Inb4 Punjab do a CSK 2010 and win the whole thing from here.,7
There are two cricket stadiums in Sharjah side by side?,5
"I want you guys to give this a read.

I got downvoted this. Might happen again.

But. 


1.  Barring the innings against CSK, Kohli has been *struggling* this IPL. 

Claims of the Sharjah pitch being a slower one by Kohli, have been finally been discarded by Punjab.

Today he scored 0 boundaries of the 31 balls that he played outside the powerplay. 
Now one might argue that it was Sundar/Dube who put pressure on Kohli but In the previous match as well, he scored only 1 boundary ( *which basically got niked* ) even while having De Villiers at the other end.


2.  Kohli *needs* to be *sacked* from captaincy. He is just not good at it. Some of the blunders in today's match include, the demotion of De Villiers & not bowling Sundar during the first 6 overs despite him being the best of all.


Had the pitch been as claimed by Kohli, RCB would have won this. RCB's bowling line up is far better than Punjab's . And 170+ should have been a par score as per the claims.


Dislike it as much as you want. But this remains the truth!",15
Finish it Gayle. Think of the nrr.,8
Why did Kohli send AB at 6?,8
I would give up my first born just for KP to never fucking commentate again.,11
"This match is a microcosm of why Kohli's batting strategy will bring him a lot of runs in T20s, and will almost always ensure that India lose to an onslaught like this. Because fundamentally he refuses accept that you have to do more than score 7 or 8 an over by picking off twos during the middle overs. I can see a match very much like this knocking India out in T20WC. 

And if he is genuinely unable to hit spinners for six during the middle overs, and is taking only singles and twos because of this, then I'm sorry I don't care what his T20I average and strike rate is, he shouldn't be playing. White ball cricket is not test cricket and making a turgid 60 or 70 over the 20 overs should absolutely be seen as a bad or match losing innings.",13
"Time for some mental gymnastics: If we keep winning, we might lose in the playoffs. Lets lose a few and reach playoffs and use our remaining luck there. 69D chess from Koach.  
 -one of us probably",6
my disappointment is immeasurable and tomorrow is ruined,7
Finish it off next over or you can expect a fuck up frok KXIP,12
Dc loosing to MI and rcb loosing to punjab who is last in the table. This is the difference between good teams and fluke teams,7
"The way he's giggling, I'm starting to get quite worried about KP falling afoul the UAE's notoriously strict drug laws tonight.",21
"Gayle : I scored 333 in a game and now it's my number 


Murali : I took 800 wickets and now it's my number


Ashwin : Well Amit Mishra has 99 , so now 999 is my number",50
People saying Kohli should leave as if RCB management will ever do that and a player of Kohli's stature could ever bear the insult of being released,7
The disrespect from KP,2
RCB dropping their nrr again for motivation,11
"Rcb don't even deserve a fucking KXIP choke to win a match like this, I'm furious.

But after all, have to remind myself this is is just a cricket match, and I'll just get back to watching Youtube the whole night",17
Morris & Saini are terrific bowlers though.,2
"Morris, what a chad. So good",2
"VK throws ball to Siraj in 16th over.   
RRR: understandable. Have a nice day.",9
What happened to Chahal? Bad Koach,2
That was beautiful from Morris and Saini,3
ex RCBians having time of their life smashing RCB,6
Good ploy waiting till rcb in sharjah to bring out the boss,5
Does RCB have a Narine?,0
Post match kohli shud be more entertaining today than on field kohli,3
I dont understand why Udana has only bowled 1 over this game? lol,6
Kya plan hai,1
RCB is like that school whose kids get 80% in board exams at max but their alumni do really well,2
"One good thing about this loss is that RCB won’t peak too early and will learn valuable lessons about their team. Some of the key lessons are:

1) Finch is useless in IPL. Can’t bat to save his life. Always look on edge and uncomfortable. Drop him for Moeen. 

2) Don’t send your batsman in when there are 4 overs and he is under pressure to take the team to a good total. If you wanted to experiment with Sundar, that’s fine. No need to experiment with Dube as well in the same game and screw everything up 

3) Morris is a good pinch hitter and should bat higher up the order

4) Siraj sucks and should stick to red ball cricket. Drop him for Parthiv. Parthiv can keep and he’ll can bat aggressively in the powerplay",1
Imagine giving Siraj 3 overs but not Chahal.,3
If RCB gets a wicket Kumble will send in Shami.,6
Was Abraham sick/injured today or are we seeing the new and improved RCB Random batting order generator at work?,2
"I have this bad feeling 

Rcb gonna lose the toss from now on, put in to bat and lose a few games, the tournament opens up and we arent so safe anymore

I dont like this feeling",9
Now you may wonder why gayle didn't play from first game,1
Please please take a single KL. Boss needs to whack one more,3
They're going to take it to the last over aren't they,5
Man ffs.... Just finish it....,2
Gayle is 35 as per csk years so we can buy him in the next auction.,8
Maiden wicket over this?,2
Kings XI should take it to the last ball just for the lolz,5
You don’t win at sharjah unless you try hitting sixes,2
Why am I tensed?,3
"why does rcb always pick and persist with mediocre and often expensive bowlers like khejroliya, harshal patel, and siraj",3
Operation Net Run Rate Bachao,1
I'm just worried that if kohli leaves rcb what kind of form he'll be in. Every player who's left become so good,5
Y does koach want to play with my heart,2
"Losing twice to the worst team in the IPL this season is peak RCB

Winning only against one of the top 3 teams in the IPL this season is peak KXIP",10
"Aight boys, back to supporting the best twitter handle in cricket",3
Lmao these fuckers are gonna take it deep again,12
"Is Kohli even trying? No overs from Sunder in PP, giving overs to Shitraj even after being expensive while your specialist foreign bowler has only bowled one over and will end up bowling 2 overs max.",4
Only rcb will bowl Yorkers when they don't need to,2
Can KXIP fuck it up from here?,3
They have Udana and they still went for Gayle's dearest friend,3
"Only one man to get 2 test triple hundreds, an ODI double hundred and a T20I hundred, Universe boss.",5
Siraj is the Impostor.,7
If this is what going to Koffee with Karan does to a mf. We need to send Pant there,5
It's punjab lmao,2
What was that bowl?😂😂😂,2
Bad captaincy today from Koach,3
we won hearts today,4
That kids I why you fucking don't change whatever was working flawlessly,4
 Brilliant by kohli to bring udana now,6
Can kxip still lose this. To know.keep watching,3
"Kev makes a nice point about Gayle doing in the test matches, problem is he did made it a few more times.",2
"3 of the last 6 runs in 7 balls have been wides

3 wides while defending 12",6
Okay. KL helping RCB nrr,4
Kumble defeating Kohli is similar to India beating Pak in 1999 WC but not qualifying for knockouts.,4
I missed the first 10 overs of the second innings.....the ball spun a lot in the first innings...what happened ? Did the ball not spin or were Mayank and Rahul really good?,2
"One solid way for KXIP to win the trophy, play against RCB at least 9 matches out of 14 in the early stages, again play against RCB in the Qualifiers and Finals.",5
MEME TEAM IS BACK,7
"Just can bowl Morris, Udana and Sundar in power play. 
Then, Saini and Chahal. 

Why do we even need Siraj to play and bowl? Why? 

Fuck you, Koach.",6
Imagine giving shitraj 3 overs and udana 1,9
How come Gayle was only brought in on this game??,6
Lol wides will win it for KXIP,6
remember hesson was the coach of kxip when they went from playoff spot at halfway stage to 7th/8th in the last 2 seasons,5
Chad KL once again proving that SRs are overrated,8
What's the point of playing Udana if he is only going to bowl 2 overs. He is occupying premium foreigner spot,13
Our bowling has looked so toothless today:(,2
Back to the hotel. Forget this match. Throw the book out of window. Stick to simple winning strategies. You still have 2 matches in next 3-4 days.,6
Three teams had 10 points. No way all three were gonna have an easy road to the playoffs. Dc is the chosen one,9
it feels like we threw away this match intentionally with so many idiotic decisions,15
"Lads, it's KXIP",2
"Udana has bowled only 1,  do they throw dice to decide who bowls next ?",9
Gayle to kohli: Dance more bitch,15
"If Kxip doesn't win this over , don't worry Kohli will ask Siraj to ball the next over",2
Hope KXIPs luck turns around after their second encounter with RCB. Definitely lost the luck in the 1st match,2
"Observe Siraj closely, because this will most probably be the last time you'll see him on a cricket field",7
How do I get a flair on rif?,3
Something about Kohli fielding at the boundary looking dejected as RCB loses makes me nostalgic and warm and fuzzy inside.,5
"My Top 5 batsmen I love/loved to watch bat(No particular order) :-
1. Gayle
2. AB
3. KP
4. Sehwag
5. Gilchrist",4
My man's played more test matches than dhoni.  Put some respect on that name.,4
Picking Sundar over chahal for that over is a worse move than ab coming in down the order imo,3
"KXIP problem is middle over batting not top order! Bringing in Gayle wouldn't solve anything

 *Gayle proceeds to close the game out for KXIP*",11
"I have two questions!
1. Why did AB bat down the order?
2. Why the fuck would you give siraj the third over even after conceding 24 in the first two overs?",6
Swann calling them idiots lmao,2
"Btw, this match seems to have one of the best over-rates in this year's IPL!

Considering that this is Sharjah where so many balls need to be placed, that is a really good achievement.",6
Take 4 more singles and win. No Glory Shot,7
just end it with a boundary already whats this dragging,2
"Koach and his retarded tactics, klr recovering his sr, uni-boss limping his way back in form, siraj getting bodied                                                                                     


Cricket is the real winner lmao",4
No change in the points table,4
Dugout is so fun,1
Wtf so slow,1
Mayank is such a handsome man,9
Super over pls!,2
Pls udana a hattrick.,7
Punjab waiting for siraj overs to win,3
Throw out siraj and get Hazelwood in. Throw out finch and have parthiv in to get the no of foreign players to 4,3
"Welcome to rcb, here we have:

Single handed Siraj: who can loose matches singlehandedly

Legside umesh: self explanatory

These two are the top of the line meme bowlers and r/cricket loves them, please tune in the next match for more info on other players.",10
RCB should think that this match never happened.,1
Now they are just torturing kohli.,2
Post match presentation please.,1
RCB should ditch the 6 bowler strategy. How does 6 bowling options help? Just play 5 bowlers and an extra 6th option. There has to be a batsman in the middle order.,3
I thought Udana is Indian🤦‍♂️,-1
Did Styris just called Brett Lee and Swann idiots?,10
Unfortunately KXP left it too late in this tournament. I wish they tried Gayle couple of matches ago.,2
Ex rcbians trying to not to fuck up rcb NRR,5
Mayank and Gayle should open but I guess KL is worried about his orange cap,5
This is the bowling they needed 5 overs ago,5
Bc do you have to take it to the last ball or what,5
"Well this game is a prime example of how bad tactics can lead to a terrible loss,

- Shuffling your batting order for matchups 
- Not bowling your strike bowler in the power play
- Not relying on your spinners/ overseas talent to take the wickets in the crucial overs",8
[deleted],7
why are they stretching this so much lmao,0
Why did Kohli give Udana only 2 overs?,3
So KXIP are RCB's kryptonite ?,4
"I can feel the wind of change. Hold your breath my fellow RCB fans ,  disappointment is coming.",3
Punjab love toeing the line. They're taking this to the 20th it seems.,3

"very smart from the indian captain, give udana 2 and siraj 4. well fucking done",12

"If Siraj didn't bowl that badly, would have been a thriller of a match",7
KL getting into his nervous mode slowly,3
"I know people don't like Dream11 here, but I made a team with no practice match or mega draw but can anyone tell how good a score of 494 is? Against the average which I can't get from anywhere.. thanks.",2
If only Sundar hadn't given away 15,0
Lol styris,3
RCB beaten by last placed team twice. They should be place ninth./s,7
Wait. Taking the game to the last over?,2
"Ufff it's just one game guys

Chill out

We've been playing well this season",0
Only if Siraj had one less over Today,3
Kohli has lost them this match even with the captaincy and with the bat as well,5
"It's ok guys, it was Kohli's 200th RCB match, needed to witness vintage RCB stuff.",2
Chahal,1
At least our NRR isn't that fucked,2
I somehow can't trust KXI till the last Run.. they were on the wrong side too many times this season,2
Kxip are in choking territory here,2
C'mon RCB you got this my n-words,-2
They gave 4 wides on the last 2 overs. Would have been 8 off 8,5
Just hit a 6 and finish this off 😒,3
Lol KXIP play MI and DC next. Oof,3
Kohli should bowl the last over for bantz.,8
"Yo this a loss alright but RCB doing gold stuff right now delaying the win for their NRR, could've been over with two overs to spare easily.",6
"Chance to improve the NRR greatly, but no.",3
Punjab you just need 1 off 3 twice. Don't mess this up again.,13
KXIP to make the Playoffs,5
Imagine having Udana and Chahal with overs left and then bowling fucking Siraj.,18
Why are they playing so slow all of a sudden? Bc I can't ever trust IPL.,3
"To think we *could've* had 5 wins out of 8, rather than 2 out of 8",9
Can KXIP score 2 of 6???,3
Match’s done but these last two overs have been quite good,9
This team is so scared of winning,6
The way they are hyping tomorrow's game all week. I guess KKR is going to defeat MI finally.,5
"Give Chahal the bowl. Who knows, he might surprise everyone. The bowl could turn a lot and Gayle simply might not get his bat on it.",7
Kohli doesnt seem to trust Udana,3
I'd love to see Punjab bottle it from here xD,2
"You don't bowl the only bowler who's gotten you a wicket, great!",3

Udana is such a better bowler than it looks.,7
Just give Siraj the final over for the final goodbye,2
Imagine they throw it away from here,3
"2 from 6, that's 1 from 3...

KXIP fans in shambles",5
Punjab doing us favour by not finishing too soon to help NRR.,5
Guess who's back? Back again.,2
"Udana should have been given more overs than Siraj, Siraj should only be given two overs max",4
Was hoping he was gonna smoke the last ball of the over out ofbthe ground tbh,3
Kohli's captaincy is still mediocre,2
Imagine just imagine,1
"RCB have bowled like 4 wides in the last 2 overs , KL has some embarrassing pictures for sure",3
"KXIP couldn't score 1 in 3, remember.",1
Guys I'm getting worried. What if Chahal bowls last over and gets two quick wickets.,1
"Just really bizarre bowling options used throughout by RCB, sealed with throwing a spinner vs Gayle when the game was running away from them.. and then the designated death bowler in Udana only gets 2 overs.",3
"Well they bottled 1 off 3

They might as well bottle 2 off 6........ lol nah",1
Kohli is a fucking joke. Udana is taken as an intl player but only gets two overs. ABD also is paid handsomely but is sent in with 18 balls to go,1
"Needing 6 off 11

Commentator: I think they're gonna get two points here

Seeing how many games punjab have lost from the jaws of victory, he's not being unreasonable",2
Punjab can still lose from here.,3
This required run rate for punjab is equivalent of 19 r.p.o for other teams.,6
"Biggest positive from the day

NRR damage limited

Morris batting

Gayle got 50",5
This is why cricket is great. A dude who runs like that can still be viable in the sport.,2
Virat Tughlaq Kohli.,6
I'm still terrified tbh.,2
I have a theory in quest of becoming unpredictable kohli makes lot of nonsense decisions and they generally don't pay off,2
Siraj fucked this up,0

"""Can we play RCB every game?""",3
"I want Kohli to be in this frame of mind for DC game too. I want to see even more ""strategies"".",3

Happy tears watching Universal boss hitting sixes.,3
"1 from 3

2 from 6

Still in it, RCB fans",6
Their best spinner has bowled just 2 overs. Wtf Virat?,1
"Punjab legit doesn't care about NRR, rightfully so",6
That spun. wtff,2
man if udana bowled 2 more,3
Holy shit that turn,3
Chahal wicket maiden?,2
The fuck.!?,2
4 wides last two overs.  Required could’ve been 6 from 6,3
Why the fuck would you bowl sundar in the 17th over and not once in the first 6 overs. Why would you give siraj more overs to bowl over udana. So many bad decisions in this match,2
jeez the turn on that ball,3
Super over maybe,3
Almost want to see KXIP choke this even though RCB winning is bad for us,6
"LOL, what was that ball",2
Scenes if KXIP choke now,6
Can kxip still fuck up,1
Sala e ka chal raha hai,1

Yes give Chahal the ball when things are not salvageable anymore,3
Lol at kxip,6
"Played ABD too late, played Chahal too late.",9
Fuck me. Super over incoming? Lmao,4
Could've been close if Siraj wasn't bowled,6
This is what happens when you send your best batsman when there are no overs left.,6
Lmao that had to be a wide,1
can kxip pull off a pakistan,3
Lmao chahal to end,2
Hmmm,1
I think RCB was just overthinking here. Trying to outplay KXIP one on one.,2
Lmao punjab can't possibly fuck this up or can they?,1
That’s the most wide unwide I’ve ever seen,9
Oh damn!,1
Is there a twist ?,1
Why did Siraj bowl 3 overs when Udana has only bowled 2?,3
1 IN 3,1
run 2 goddammit,1

Big spins,2

Surely not kxip losing,3
Fuck me,2
1 off 3 again,3

"This is ridiculous. But, pretty much a summary of how KXIP's season has been till now. They have found ways to lose matches.",4
Kxip should be relegated,3
"Lol... Who will win this?

Will KXIP pull off a KXIP, or RCB pull off an RCB?",5
This is fucking pathetic. How can anyone not say that these guys are not scoring deliberately. Fucking fixers.,5
Lol what is the point of square leg umpires?,1
KXIP is fucking shit,7
Rahul does a real no u sends Shami who hits a 6,7
ridiculous. this game should have finished a whole over ago. What is this choking mentality?,6
matematematematemate,5
"Good bowling by Morris, Saini, and Udana created this pressure. Wow Chahal, what a player.",10
How costly could the wides be rcb bowled in the last 2 overs,6
This is what happens when the 2 biggest meme teams play each other,13
"Ah shit, here we go again",7
Pretty sure KXIP still has this.,8

I'm just sad Prity is sad,3
Lol lol,1
Gayle looks like he about to cry,4
If only we hadn’t bowled those wides. We would’ve won,3
That's some real tough competition going out there to be called as the BEST MEME TEAM!!!,3
This is shit tier finishing.,4
So it’s a battle to see who is the bigger RCB?,5
Bruh is this some black magic,3
Kaise kar lete hain ye,2
Punjab is peak meme team.,4
I'm sorry but WTF punjab,5
Oh shit what a time for a runout,4
WTF how have they let it come to this after being in the driver seat since like 5-6 overs ago,5
"KXIP man , you lot....",3
Thank God I'm not a KXIP supporter,7
HAHAHAHAHAH,5
You literally can't trust them till they hit the winning run,10
P in KXIP is pain,15
Munawar tu pitega😡,6
"**19.5** Chahal to Rahul, OUT, **run-out!** Gayle is walking off! Oh KXIP, how, time and again, do you make it so complex for yourselves? **171-2**

CH Gayle run out (Padikkal/&dagger;de Villiers) 53 (45b 1x4 5x6) SR: 117.77",10
Bring in mindless Maxwell. Goes for a six and gets caught,7
Kings 12 should be investigated. Who throws away matches from such stages,9
Gotta pull a Stoinis and get a wicket now,6
KXIP^TM,4
"Where are the ""tHIs iS fIXeD"" comments at ?🔥🔥🔥🔥",7
Oh my. Wtf,5
Even if they win they’ve already lost 😂😂😂,5
The fuck,6
How is this humanely possible ????,2
Oh god,3
Match is never over with kxip.,3
No way this shit aint fixed,7
This is too level script,2
Jeez. I was kidding when I said super over,2
Some one said here earlier they need 1from 3 twice show yourself.,1
LMAO KXI has no confidence,3
I love KP on commentary.,3
That was a 2 on the 3rd ball tbh,6
RCB RCB,3
It’s like KXIP really want to be the meme team,4
I think we can all agree that KXIP is this year's meme team.,2
Brainless captaincy by Virat. Still match goes till last ball. Lol,10
Kumble is gonna rip their heads off if they lose it from here.,2
Rahul is anti-Tewatia,7
"If they lose, KXIP fans should just start a riot at this point and burn this franchise to the ground.",1
JIMBONEESH: my life is pain,1

Whaaaaaaaaat is happening.,1
Why didn't Gayle run that second,1
This is just too good to be true isn't it?,3
Zinta about to kill a motherfucker,8
Inb4 anticlimatic 1 run completed,8
No matter who you support you gotta admit KXIP is the best test team,5
Is this fucking real,3
Fixed TM /s,2
WHAT THE FUCK,2
KL is the dumbest cricket  to come out of India for a long time,4
S C R I P T E D,5
"These 2 meme teams shouldn't be fucking allowed to play with each other

Fucking dying of laughter",6
They took only KXIP can bottle this seriously.,2
Should've went for 2 earlier then lmaoo,2
This is why Koach was taking it easy,5
nooo Punjab girl don't be sad :(,2
This cant possibly be happening again😂,5
Pooran wouldn't bottle this would he? No fucking way,3
This can't be real 😭😭,1
Protecting the averages the last few overs it seems. Really selfish batting,2
If KXIP loses this they will also lose 90% of thier audience,3
Meme team to the full extent,3
Who ever comes in better just be a runner.,2
I'm literally in tears. This shit is so funny😂😂😂,7
"Kumble be like any other team would do.

Don't do it against kohli ffs.",2
Looking back it’s easy to say it’s due to Siraj. But maybe because of that over these kxip players got over complacent and now we are at 1 from 1z,2
"Had Udana bowled that over instead of Siraj, RCB would have won this long back",3
Meme team living to their name,6
"Should have just run on the previous ball. Either they get the run, or Gayle is out and someone fast is there.",2
Chutiya team sorry for my rant,2
Kings XI bringing themselves back to 2020 form,1
KXIP are the ultimate IPL chokers.,4
Both the teams are trying their best to lose the match.,5
ig this is why cricket isn't just about big hits :3,2
Two meme teams fucking up lmaoooo,2
Surely this can't be superover right??????😳😳😳,1
KP losing his mind hahahaha,2
I'm laughing hard rn,3
You got to be fucking kidding me!!,4
Kxip : ABORT!!! ABORT!!,1
Pooran gonna swing for the heavens and miss it,2
After all those bloody wides. Punjab even if you win get outta here,2
Pooran ez six for sure,3
I feel bad for preety 😢,3
BROTHERS I CANT STOP LAUGHING,5
Meme meme meme team,1
Script writing go brrr,8
Only if Chahal came in early,2
I swear to God Punjab this is last chance,4
"KL Rahul is a scared little boy. FFS, how can you fuck this up so badly.",7
"No short run wrongly called and still this can happen, still want to blame that eh?",3
Wtf is wrong with you Punjab?,5
"12 runs in last 20 balls, KXI have done it again",4
It's Dark Arts,1
"Oh kxip, what should i say about you, you beauty of chokers",3
Sad KL Rahul noises,3
Amazing game.,2
"Absolute bonkers , when meme collieds with meme. 🤝",13
lmao i thought match is over and turned off tv,8
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING,3
Pooran misses?,2
Scenes if this is a wide,4
this match will only be fair if it ends in a tie neither team deserves to win lmao,3
Why the fuck would they take 10 off 17 with 9 wickets hand 'easy'. It's two hits. There's Maxwell and Pooran to come. Great bowling from RCB,4
Bowl a wide comeon,3
I'll fucking eat my dog if it's a super over,3
This is why they have the best opening pair but they don't fucking win,3
I cant believe my eyes! Is there any more f*d up way to end a match!,1
"Chahal's action shud also be reported now

Lmao",3
An in form Pooran is probably the best you can hope to come in when you need a run off the last ball,2
Chahal with them mind game lmao,3
"Fuck this shit, I am not even kxip fan and this is a strange feeling. This should've have come down to this",6
KXIP new RCB,3
Cheeky mankad come on,2
KP jinxed it,1
Chahal is having fun,3
These two sides deserve to be memed!!,5
Im ded now,4
[deleted],3
The question is why didn't Chahal get more overs earlier wtf,4
So nice of KXIP to actually give a chance to the team who are still in contention,7
Those who were criticising Kohli for running 1s and 2s should look at this. The game is just not about boundaries.,7
KL needed to hit it over the top.,2
Meme game delivers again!!,3
hahahahahahahahaha,1

Thank god,3
"how did KXIP who needed 9 off 17 balls bring the match to this stage, seriously RCB need death bowling KXIP needs death batting",11
Kumble looks like he's gonna murder someone,6

Kings XI should rename to Clown XI with all these Fiestas.,24

Only KXIP can bat this deep.,16
I don't ever want to hear RCB being called the meme team again. That title belongs to KXIP forever now.,38
KXIP tried really hard but failed to fuck this up.,53
Thank God,11
If he had caught that omg,28
It’s like they broke a curse or something.,15

thank you kxip for taking it to the last ball,14
OH MY GOD!! FINALLY!!,4
Fucking pooran man. Can't hate this guy.,20
"So, in conclusion, RCB fucked up. KXIP could have lost this.",23
Disapointed with KXIP management on not sending  Shami in,15
Beautiful,3
This is what happens two chokers meet. You get the most golden over in ipl history.,43
Bhai aaj lose karte toh KL apna nass kat ke pitch pe late jata,12
These guys are big-time chokers lol. Glad that they finally broke the curse.,10
There was no way Pooran was going to fuck that up lmao,11
They came close despite Kohli's captaincy not because of it,14
"lmao you play through the inning still can't ensure your team wins 
 
fuck off with this taking it deep approach",19

KXIP finally clinch victory from the jaws of victory.,15
RCB saved a lot of NRR there.,9
Pooran MotM,6
Pooran didn't get the memo i guess😂,6
Lmao Swann crushing over Preity,5
FUCK YOU SIRAJ. IF I MET HIM IN PERSON HE'LL KNOW HOW MUCH ANXIETY HE HAS GIVEN ME,7
"People pay for 40 overs, they get 40 overs. Only KXIP care about the aam admi",8
"Thats the right strat

Balls turning.? Don't let it then.",3

"Hey neutrals, don't you just love KXIP matches? I would if I were you",14
"If this match was held at any other ground,we could have got a Super over",8
BENCHOD!!!!!!,7
That was a bad win,2
Jeez I was just fucking around when I said Kings XI should take it to the last ball. They actually did take it to the last ball lmfao,6
Lagaan scenes 4K edition,14
The 3 overs from Siraj and the poor strategy with RCB batting order has cost them the match,8
KL loves his wicket way too much. More than his life I think. Idiot.,7
Pooran Poli,2
"Was really close to a catch, sharjah boundaries saved them",1
"have to give it to yuzi, #respect",4
"Well, Almost..... Almost. 

Please, just bench Siraj. Thanks.

Play, Negi or Gurkeerat. I don't care. Not Siraj.",11
Mayank already feels like winning the title,6
As cool as a super over would have been. I wanted kxip to finish it. They deserve it.,4
Lmao almost managed to choke from 11 req from 3 overs,7
Just imagine if those last 4 wides weren’t bowled..... This was rcbs match to win,7
WTF was this game lol,6
Only KXIP can shock KXIP,6
KXIP: The ultimate meme team!,5
Moral victory for Koach,3
"KXIP have no concept of NRR, do they?",5
One thing KXIP really need to fix is bring Gayle at the top and move Mayank or KL to no.3... the amount of singles and twos missed today were horrendous.,8
First time seeing both teams doing everything to lose,12
"Fuck you Chahal - From Pooran

I really didn't like that bye Chahal did to Mayank",14
Man of the match for KXIP - Siraj,11
It's funny how kohli forgets to do all those dance moves with Gayle when his team loses..,13
"If it wasn't for Pooran, KXIP lost this.",6
KXIP celebrating like they won the World Cup,12

This is so fixed.,2
Why the fuck didn't udana bowl his 4,8
"Runs this IPL

Maxwell- 58

Gayle- 53",20
Pooran is the MVP.,6
"Kings 11 is RCB lite hehe...
Updoots to the right",3
Curse transfer to RCB complete,7
what a finish lmao,5
Shit captaincy from Viral Kilo.,12
Mayank feeling like he won the title. KL feeling like he won the Hunger Games.,4
I don't like KXIP but I have never been so happy for someone I don't like,4
If they fucked that up I wouldn’t have been very shocked tbh.,8
Sending AB in the 15th over would have probably won this game for RCB. Brainless decision making,10
Kumble 2 Koach 0,7
Poor Mayank. He deserves a better team.,8
"RR still there with the worst net run rate, they never disappoint",6
Gutsy of Pooran to go for a six last ball..,14
What a shit captaincy by favourite player.,5
"We've won 2 games, both against the same meme team -_-",16
For fuxks sake kxip.,7
[deleted],12
"Thank god kxip won, i don't know if the team could have forget this loss in eternity",8
These fuckers sucked out all joy out of this win,32
Punjab really the meme team this year,14
My dad was saying that KXIP should win easily and I said that you literally can't trust these buggers till they hit the winning run. Looks like I was right,20
more twist in this script then in any other bollywood movie,14
that goddamn siraj over,4
MI to win tomorrow 🙏,15
Can someone tell me why Udana bowled only 2 overs and Siraj bowled 3?,12
"For all the experts here who wanted to bowl isuru and chahal, there was a clear plan to not bowl left hander to gayle along with a leg spinner . They r scared of gayle mishits going for six. They obviously know more than the armchair critics here",14

This game was an inner battle between meme RCB vs 2020 RCB,14

1. What's the decision taken by Kohli all about. 
2. Why take so deep to KL",10

Siraj must be bowling damn good in the nets to command a place in the playing XI,8
That was a bad strategy from Kings. If it's comfortable never let it get to last over.,14
"Won by 8 wickets, in the last ball of the innings, you might think it was a phenomenal chase, except...",16
Did I drink too much whiskey nor did KXIP really won a match?,12
Kohli should have bowled the 17th over. He tried everything but that.,19
They don’t make it easy for themselves,19
"Wtf firecrackers, they wanted to motivate kxip or what",14
Pooran finishing off with 600 strike rate.,28
So this was truly a RCB A vs RCB B.,47
I'm gonna go put 10 bucks on kxip making the playoffs.,11
"That was too funny, 1 off 3 almost got them again xD",18
This is what happens when both teams try to lose.,18
This win won't even give KXIP confidence for the next games,23
It's like neither of them wanted to win lmaoo,2
"Even though Gayle is still a six hitting beast, his running absolutely is a liability and in a larger ground or against a bigger target it will cost Punjab big time",9
If Morris was Pollard he could have caught it.,8
absolutely based Pooran,7
What did I just watch?,10
Why would these chuts take it to the 20th over?,12
I think mom should be Kohli for how he sent ABD at 6 and then making Siraj bowl 2 overs against Gayle he deserves the mom.,30
Broo kxip lost the match against kkr due the same thing and almost lost today's match(rcb just was more fked up)It's like they don't learn anything from mistakes. Kl mannn,20

Hope this win gets Kings XI to beat the other teams,7
Gotta give it to KXIP - They had almost done KXIP's thing today,15
Kohli is a dreadful captain tbh. What's the point of changing what's been working so well that too against the bottom most team!,14
KXIP fans: how do you do it? Just... how?,9
"Should Kings XI continue playing Gayle? Don't think you can have both Rahul and Gayle playing, especially in the top 3",8

Love how he is brushing off the questions xD",10

KXIP: We don’t want to win either.",29

"Scriptwriter fucking with KXIP too much, find someone else man",20
That Siraj over cost us,9
Lmao Koach is so amused,11
It's almost like the Universe was playing on Punjabs Side  today or something,8
Those 9 wides by RCB came to haunt them,13
Bowling a spinner in the last over is not a bad ploy imo. There won't be any byes or the ball flying off the edge of the bat.,11
"ABD demoted for left-right combo! 

This is the most hilariously stupid thing I have ever seen!",23
"MI once needed 6 of 6 vs PWI, Rohit brought it down to 1 needed of 1, only to smash a massive six of the last ball",9
Brainless decisions from RCB but at least they discovered that Morris is in pretty good form with the bat as well.,13
Looked like nobody wanted to win,22
Kl was 58 from 40 then scored just 3 runs in his last 9 balls to make the game close,17
"Left right combination?

You called him alien de villers last match ffs.",10

Morris is 1.96m....if he couldn't catch it no one else in RCB probably could,16

"Well The Universe Boss did well and I enjoyed a lot, such a Legend, hopefully he plays next IPL too",12
"Neesham,Mayank deserves better teams",6

Kohli ffs stop relying on Siraj to bowl crucial overs. No hate on the guy but he can't handle the pressure.,23
"**RCB's Last 3 matches vs KXIP**

It will be RCB thing to not qualify from here.,14
must say Kohli's captaincy cost them the game today,19
Just one question to neutral fans- Do you got the guts to be fan of such teams?,32
Finch sabotages the batting line-up at the top and Siraj hemorrhages runs at the other end. Both these guys need to go. Complete liabilities to the team.,11

"Good game but, damn r/cricket is too toxic today.",13
Convinced that Punjab needs a psychologist to help them believe they are capable of winning,46
"I think this match HAS to have cleared the mental block we have been playing with. Sometimes a win is all you need. We couldve been here with 5 wins, but 2 will do for now.",16
KXIP: the makers of thrillers no matter how one sided the match becomes,16

Rcb is facing RR , KKR and CSK in last three matches.

Koach just rolls the dice to arrive at the match strategy. It's RTG all the way down.,8
"for gayle's physical stature and cocky attitude, his voice is super soft",26
"Kohli saying that was no conversation when the last over began, even he thought it was over lol. KXIP somehow took this to the last ball, I have no idea how.",19
This was a weird game.,15
"Lol auto captions came up with ""Kings 11 Punch Job""

I think its safe to say that siraj's career is finally over.,7
"Fuck me, I am not even feeling happy. These muthafuckas should have finished it with two overs to go",15
"WTF were those last few overs from KXIP!
Turned it into a test match. Fuck KL Rahul",12
I think RCB needed this loss you know. Keep them concentrated but not hurt the points table that much.,15
Lmao Gayle. He is very casual. Love the convo,18
Siraj is Dhoni of bowlers,1
"siraj caused massive damage man imagine rcb having 12 points, so sad",14

Yes Udana and Chahal didn't bowl their 4 overs but this is what you'll get if you play 6 specialist bowlers. Someone is going to get under bowled every time. I am not sure playing 6 specialist bowlers is the right way to go.,2

Can we have Gayle as a commentator when he retires,35

18th over - 4 runs
19th over - 5 runs
Just 9 runs in 2 overs.

And it goes to final ball. Crazy & only KXIP can do it",23
Wait till KLPD makes 3 more changes to the side next game.,15
Boss upside down😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽,14
We all just gonna ignore the fact that Gayle denied the second run there,18
Gayle's voice doesn't really fit his body somehow.,20
So it was a tactical decision to hold AB back. Well played,24

"Virat is basically like ""Naah man, Abraham was 100% fit, we wanted to fuck shit up a bit.""",33

been reading what everyone has to say here and i'm surprised how our NRR didn't take a massive blow- we even took it to the last ball even after fucking up everything that worked wonders for RCB.

They have an amazingly balanced team option but I don't know why they don't stick to the basics.  They have the bowling this year too.

Why ?",18
"Do the two big teams winning yet another IPL title bring as much joy as teams like KXIP winning a game? Or seeing Gayle play and score again? Does Australia winning another WC bring as much joy to their fans as the 2011 wc did to Desi folks?

My friend kissed everyone he saw lmao, several enacted Ganguly's topless celebration, but I digress)

The point being, small moments sometime big joy, big moments sometime small joy",23
"Ugh sometimes he is one of the best leader and sometimes i don't know man, udana bowling just 2 overs and completing saini's quota too early. Keeping chahal till the end is acceptable, because he has delivered in the past, taking those crucial wickets and conceding few runs while defending in those last overs, but maybe he shouldn't have risked Washington after 15th over.",15
"KXLP: Call an ambulance

Pooran: But not for me",23
Who's advicing Kolhi from the outside,16
Gayle is making sure that RCB regrets for not buying him in the auction.,36
The only explanation for this match lasting till the last ball is that Kumble wanted Kohli to suffer after revived hope.,45
"The folks at Cricbuzz raised a good point. Why did KL take that risky single when he knew that Gayle isn't gonna make it. He is taking a chance with both Gayle and the new batsman and shying away from the responsibility. I don't think KL has in it atleast right now to lead the side since he gets too nervous. It is okay to be nervous and learn handling it, but not as a captain. His mentality is what is transcending into the team and explains why they lost 3 close games.",42
In the initial two matches Virat made poor mistakes but after that he was doing incredibly well. This Hesson+Katich+Kohli trio's USP has been something that we haven't seen from RCB in the past - learning from past mistakes. So it's both shocking and incredibly disappointing performance from the men in red. I can accept AB coming at six because they took a gamble and it didn't pay off but Udana Chahal only bowling 2 overs while giving Siraj a crucial over after Saini and Morris did so well. These are things that is just unacceptable coming from the Indian skipper.,9
