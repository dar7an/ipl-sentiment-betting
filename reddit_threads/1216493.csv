Waiting for Glendeep singh Maxwell to unleash again on holy land of uae,20
"I have Pant, Maxwell, KL, Rabada, Shaw and Ashwin in fantasy league for today's game. I am picking matches where I can get maximum points. This is the one. What do you think about my selection?",1
C'mon. Let's admit we all are here to watch Mishra ji,2
Can't the broadcasters talk about fucking today's game??,3
"Ash Vs Maxwell..The Friendly Foe fight is here
Carrom Ball Or Switch hits",1
Fingers crossed for a Desert Gayle Storm today 🤞,2
Both teams look pretty solid and equal and paper. Hope we get an interesting match,2
"Why tf KXIP management changes core team every 2 year? That's one of the reason KXIP is inconsistent. They should cement the spots of KL, Shami & Maxwell. When's the next squad reset of IPL, anyways?",3
"My Playing XI for DC  
Shaw, Dhawan, Rahane, Pant, Iyer, Stoinis, Harshal, Ashwin, Lamichane, Rabada, Nortje",1
"KL is our captain, wicketkeeper and opening batsman. No pressure, lad.",85
Does KL has any previous captaincy experience ?,1
Wait KXIP and DC have fans?,2
"So for the new IPL watcher here, is there much to watch out for this game other than some big names?",6
Hope you're all ready for my complaining about the windies lads being misused/not selected.,6
"me coming back for a second session of shit posting after yesterday's match: ah shit, here we go again",-2
[deleted],2
2 recent centurions - Maxy and Carey playing against each other. Gotta see if they can retain the form,1
"I m looking out for Shimron Hetmyer big time

Ex Rcbian factor",1
lol Gayle doing that cortell salute during the new guy capping was uber fun n wholesome if u ask me,5
"Ashwin joking about the news about him and Ponting, saying they needed a ""marketing stunt"".  Perfect.",4
I just need Maxwell and pooran to play man. Would be a plus if neesh plays as well. I know Jordan is a highly rated t20 bowler but I think neesh has a comparable average and can bat. I think he's the steal of the auction if used wisely,3
KL captaining for only the second time in top level cricket.,2
I'm am just hoping for a good game and we beat the shit out of Punjab. Fuck every other team except DC.,2
Feels weird watching cricket; haven't seen a game since the World Cup final,4
Here hoping the editing job on the crowd noise track is better today than yesterday,2
Watch Star Sports pre-match if you want to get aneurysm.,2
All the 6 DC supporters have marked themselves in this thread,1
"Maxwell can be a game changer in my opinion , He's in red hot form",2
"fk I thought it was scott styris at first, only to learn it was brett lee...

2020 is wild",1
"Time for the trash talk

KL > Shreyas

Mayank > pant

Pooran > hetmeyer

Maxi > Carey",-1
"Hi, I'd like to order one Galestorm please",1
Everyone stop what you are doing here! Joe Denly is opening the bowling for Kent in the Vitality Blast against Surrey!!!,2
"obligatory ""shaw is overrated"" comment",2
This is really condescending from Sunny. Yeah they look upto MSD but Kl and Shreyas are now captains of their own IPL. They deserve more respect.,7
Holy shit gavaskar is so cringe this year.,4
Love that Delhi Capitals gives us a peak into the future of Indian cricket . Added experience of Dhawan just gives them  the edge today unless KLPD,5
Why is the match bot supporting Lancs?,3
No mujeeeeb,3
I don't know why but feel uncomfortable listening to both KL and Iyer. Their interviews don't seem as free flowing as most of the previous players.,3
I've missed Sarfaraz,3
"Rabada, Heytmyer, Nortje, Stoinis",3
DD's page about to be overrun by fans of a certain spinner,7
So Punjab wanted to go with a bit more bowling choosing Jordan over neesh. interesting.,1
If there is no mankad today we riot,7
Easy win for us,2
"Gayle's not playing. See you tomorrow, lads.",4
"Created an account just tp say this. Gavaskar, you're a great player. But fuck you for undermining Iyer and Rahul. Stop duck riding Dhoni",9
Jesus they are sweating.,2
[deleted],1
No Gayle today just Kayle,3
DC sorta turning Dhawan into their mascot and all he does is stereotypical Punjabi things.... kuch apna lao yaar,2
Why tf Karun over Mandeep??!,1
I'm just here for Ashwin's overs,3
No Neesham is kinda weird,1
"No Gayle is a travesty, who else is gonna bowl ropey off spin in rockstar shades ?",8
KL Rahul just said that they’re going to express themselves. As an RCB fan I can vouch that nothing that happens after this comment is good for the team.,15
I am really hyped to watch Ethical to up against his last year's team,5
This squad must not bottle this. We stacked ass fuckkkkk,3
"Here for my second team DC bois... Although I absolutely hate Delhi city, it's nice that they have such a wholesome team.",0
"This could be r/agedlikemilk material but I think KL’s gonna be a great captain, man is cool as a cucumber",4
"This was always an expected batting lineup, will be interesting where they bat Hetmyer, personally wouldn't bat him ahead of Pant no matter what, Ishant's injury is surely a setback but I was hoping they'd play Harshal for his left arm variation and pinch hitting abilities.

Don't mind Sandeep missing out, no way he was going to get in ahead of Mishraji and Ash, when he isn't taking wickets he's leaking runs",2
Why play Axar when you have Mishra!,2
"No mujeeb ur rahman

No sandeep lamichhane 

2020 is really wierd",-1
Lmao why does Pritvi looks like a 35 year old just came out of rehab in those headshots ?!,4
"Shaw, Dhawan, Iyer, Hetmeyer, Stoinis, Pant, Aswin, Axar, Rabada, Nortje, Mohit",1
[deleted],1
Maybe this is why Prthvi Shaw needs cough syrup https://twitter.com/kshitijchauhan/status/978735942352756736,-1
"As if a Jamaica, Guyanese, Bajan and Trini man are all playing in the same ipl game, beautiful stuff",4
YEAHHHH Nortje’s playing! Gives me an incentive to watch this match.,2
Why doesn't this thread update the playing XI and scores like every other thread?,1
Gayle injured?,1
Why does Shreyas Iyer look like he is always about to burst into tears?,3
Who will be fat shamed today? My bet is on Hetmeyer,4
"Is Nortje good? Hasn't looked too impressive in what little I've seen of him.

Daniel Sams should definitely be given a chance at some point during this tourney",1
"Is Nortje good? Hasn't looked too impressive in what little I've seen of him.

Daniel Sams should definitely be given a chance at some point during this tourney",0
"Is Nortje good? Hasn't looked too impressive in what little I've seen of him.

Daniel Sams should definitely be given a chance at some point during this tourney",1
"Pant at 5 is madness, you want him to be facing as much balls as possible",3
Karun Nair. I don’t know how I feel about that. Would’ve rather had another all-rounder.,1
I thought Roy was part of DC.,0
"Cottrell Shami Jordan

Punjab pace looking spicy",1
I just want Ashwin to runout someone at the nonstriker's end.,8
"Some team, any team... please bat Maxwell at 3 for at least 3-4 matches",3
Riots in Nepal reported,4
"I haven't been following IPL super closely, now did Iyer end up as the captain of Delhi over Dhawan?",1
"First year watching IPL, let's go King XI",7
Pooran is Kerala's favourite IPL player,7
[deleted],0
"It's going to be spicy seeing Ashwin vs KXIP, the team that dropped him after being their captain last season. 

Imagine the scenes if Ashwin pulls a Mankad against KL. 

*Wild*",11
That 82m boundary giving me a hard on.,1
DC's jersey is generic af,3
Delhi Chonkitals vs Chonks XI Punjab,-4
DC is the low key batdeep with Rabada at 11.,4
Akash chopra called Maxwell 'The Wonder from Down Under',1
Pritvi Shaw seems to have gotten a bad case of Rashid Khan,11
How does Prithvi manage to look both 12 and 59 at the same time,8
"Harshal Patel can replace Stoinis in future games to clear one more spot for foreign guy, he was really good as Allrounder in Syed Ali trophy.",2
Prithvi balding already wtf,16
"IPL doesn't even use a bat flip, what amateurs",6
I presume that Warne is going to appear on comms at some point today just to express how hard he is getting at everything Stoinis does,6
How do I pick a team to support?,2
"Yesterday: Thicc Tiwary
Today: Thicc Stoinis",1
very excited for Ravi Bishnoi,5
Rahane not picked or injured?,2
Had to miss yesterday’s match - my parents 50th Anniversary.  So glad IPL is back!,2
"Hetmyer played for RCB last season and did fuck all except for 1 good performance after we were knocked out, so expect him to magically transform to one of the best players of the league this season.",6
"Don't Kings XI have some good young indian players?

Surprised to see Karun Nair being persisted with not that he is bad or anything",-2
"I'm neutral today 

Wanna have some good cricket",1
"Hetmeyer is out of RCB. So, according to the scriptures he will have an outstanding season.",5
If Ashwin mankads someone I will quit my fucking job,1
Ashwin will make KXIP pay for releasing him.,3
Karun Nair is an amazing player! I can't wait to see him shut y'all up,2
My man Rahul trying to do a big MS here by donning the gloves and the captaincy hat. Go far lad... Knock Pant out forever.,0
Where is my man Rahane?,0
Isn't Pooran a better keeper than Rahul?,2
Leaving out Mujeeb is daft.,6
Having this feeling of Shaw bashing a quick 5 fours and get bowled cheaply to Cottrell.,3
"Nice, we have six bowling options this time. Having only five hurt a lot last time.",2
Shaw already losing hair?,3
[deleted],2
"So, this makes who will succeed Koach for the captaincy in future! Iyer Vs KL",6
"WRT player fitness, I expect this match to be at a better level than yesterday's. (Looks worryingly at Prithvi Shaw)",2
Waiting for the Cottrell salute,3
Prithvi morphing in to Sehwag.,8
Why is the umpire wearing a Brisbane Heat Jersey?,2
was noball,7
Rahane got traded to DC so he can sit on the bench.,3
"Going for King's just to contradict KP. DO YOU HEAR ME KP?

(And put some bloody socks on!)",3
Oof,0
These two teams have so many good players that they struggle to make a good combination,6
I want Karun Nair to score a century and not get picked for the rest of the season,106
That was a No Ball,1
I just can’t see Rahane getting a match.,2
hyped for Ravi Bishnoi ngl,2
will rahane be the first mid season transfer in IPL history?,5
Top bowling from Cottrell,2
How this man is getting swing in UAE?! Wow,6
Why is there no slip ffs?,2
Where do you think stoinis should come,4
"Wait, No Rahane?",3
Chonkraz khan..,2
At least they're not doing the ridiculous sanitising of the ball because a groundsman touched it,3
some serious biryani munching has been going down in India lockdown,10
"Why the hell DC signed Rahane anyway, we already have so many batsmen and he is hardly the guy you would want to watch in a T20 match. Especially after 2016 T20 WC SF.",6
Sarfaraz looks thinner doesnt he?,4
Isn't Jimmy Neesham a better option?,1
[deleted],5
Sarfaraz for chonkiest boi of the match award?,0
Thicboi sarfraz,0
No fake crowd noise. Thank fuck,14
"What's up with Ravi Bishnoi, is he that good, never watched him play",1
lmao Sarfaraz Khan is fielding where he gets 90% of his runs by scoops,7
KXIP should just drop the pretense and call themselves karnataka ranji team,5
"My bois all the best, love you Delhi",1
brett lee trolling deano on dugout lmao,3
Glen Maxwell always looks like he’s had a shit nights sleep,3
4 Karnataka players in the King's XI squad,2
Sarfaraz touches the ball and the ball goes from third man to behind the keeper.....,2
Where's Harsha bogle? is he not in the commentator team this year?,2
prithvi shaw has a lot to prove,2
"I reckon KXIP today, backing CJ to take one or two",1
The advertisement where ranveer singh climbs the pyramid is illegal in Egypt right?,1
No place for Rahane in this XI?,0
"Why star sports 2 not showing match , I like to watch in eng ,",1
Is it me or all the IPL jerseys are hideous,2
2nd over Shami let's go,2
God please tell me they won't ever continue with the crowd noises. Its nice in here,3
My boy shami is here,2
Shami shami shami !,2
Stoinis not an opener is a waste in T20. Why do they always mess up the lineups!,0
brett lee looks like scott styris!! ftw!!,1
Shaw looks in good touch tbh.,2
What the hell was that swing,2
Ohhh,2
Damnit Sami ... this is not second innings. Don't bowl such nuts,3
Shami looking fit af.,5
"Comm: Grass is slightly naughty . 

Smh.",5
What's the difference between the English stream and the Dugout stream on HotStar? Only the commentators?,2
"""What a nut""",2
Why is Pooran not keeping,4
Wow that ball was a peach from Shami,7
What the fuck that was so beautiful all of Punjab orgasmed on that,6
I think KXIP has more fans from Karnataka than Punjab,19
YES MO SHAMI,2
Shaw looks patchy...,6
How has Shami never had a good ipl season?,1
Prithvi Unsure,1
"At this point, Shami should just shave his hair off. Would look intimidating as fuck.",2
Shaw taking notes from Bumrah's inning last night.,3
Every ball these 2 play is a ball Pant isn't smashing for 6.,10
I love a good swinging pitch,2
[deleted],6
Shami defo looks like he's been going to the gym instead of shoveling down tonnes of Mutton biryani like the rest of his team mates. Good on him.,18

What a terrible play,2
LOL that was fucking village,6
the DISRESPECT,3
[deleted],4
Farrrr too amateurish Cricket,4
Oh the drama!!! Love it,3
I’m surprised Shami has such a poor IPL record. 40 wickets at an average of 39 and an economy of 9. He has become a much better bowler than that.,5
Send stoinis,2
Pakistan level running that lol,49
"prithvi shaw must've been out ffs

Dhawan sacrificed his wicket here",5
400iq move from KL to misfield /s,7
Ffs,3
"Ah, Prithvi! One of the worst runners in cricket.",9
That delay in crowd noise.,5
clearly the crowd noise distracted them,8
Bruh the audience sounds so bad 😐,3
Call No ffs cough syrup,6
Kl rahul got saved because of the runout.,6
Shaw is not a good runner between the wickets I've noticed this before as well,7
My second team playing like my first choice team. Brilliant start to the tournament. GG lads.,2
"It takes time whether bowling, batting or keeping.",2
Pritvi sold him to the streets,7
W O W,2
Lol,2
"Been a Kings XI fan since the first IPL, I would love to see them repeat their UAE performance but the batting order might see us short...",3
"Uh, nice running there, boys.",4
"Here..children, we see textbook Harakiri.",5
"**1.4** Mohammed Shami to Dhawan, OUT, **has he dropped him? Doesn't matter, coz he runs him out anyway!** KL Rahul makes amends immeidately, but Dhawan is caught napping here. **6-1**

S Dhawan run out (&dagger;Rahul/Gowtham) 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",5
Prithvi gives no fucks,2
Yeah these guys are not winning anything again lol,2
Shikhar Dha ~~wan~~ Zero,5
lmao what kind of stick cricket crowd reaction was that,1
Such an easy single there and they fucked it up,2
Classic yes yes yes No.,1
Thiccmeyer 🥵🤤,6
Simran is here.,3
Pain,1
Dhawan was inspired by dhoni,1
Prithvi Shaw is suffering from upcoming Indian batsman syndrome where he feels his wicket is more valuable than anyone else.,0
Inzi would be proud.,0
Hetmyer at 3! Let's go!,0
Is Bishnoi the legspinner from the u19 world cup earlier? There was a dude who bowled pretty well in that Bangladesh game,3
Bets on shreyas and shaw partnership? Foreshadowing for worldcup 2023,1
Prithvi Shaw screwed him,1
did he get a glove on that,2
welcome to ground DC,2
Hetmyer's pants is a few sizes too small,4
Mohommed Xiaomi on fire,2
Dhawan 0 (2) - run out (Shaw),4
Bruh.,2
Interesting to see hetmeyer up the order. I would have thought an early wicket mean iyer wood come up,1
Hetmyer at 3 intresting,1
I think my days of sulking are gonna come,3
Dont drink cough syrup kids,2
"The lack of audience is disappointing but it's also a blessing in disguise -


We can finally hear Daddy Hetmeyer's cheeks clap as he runs 😍",3
KL Rahul playing 5D game to dismiss Dhawan,3
I heard smt,1
Then why would you appeal like that ffs,4
What an awful appeal,2
Omg i heard that knick kl is a deaf boy,1
Review it you cats,3
~~IPL~~ TEST MATCH IN COLORED CLOTHES.,6
"Why were you so excited then, KL?",5
What's this.. should have sent stoinis at 3,2
lmao,1
Where did the noise come from?,3
Lol wtf was that appeal,2
Prithvi better pull Rohit by scoring big after taking runout as sacrifice.,2
"""Come on, Son""",0
Toxic commentary,7
Delhi sends in a left hander. Sunny: I see Iyer did a Dhoni there.,1
Miles between bat and ball lol,3
Wtf delhi,3
Pleb fielding,2
Is it too early to say #ShawOut,2
Lmao chain reaction,9
Wow KL Rahul is a proper shithouse captain,6
Shami needs to take a page out of Dhawan's book and shave all his hair off,2
Nice acting brah,6
Lmao. What the fuck is happening !?!,2
Lmao so much drama I love it,2
"They are back to Daredevils mode, fml",5
If you are gonna appeal might as well appeal hard nothing to loose,2
clear daylight between bat and bowl,4
Wtf is going on,2
What's the word. Rusty.,2
Petition to remove the Delhi Daredevils flair and keep only the Delhi Capitals flair. This is blasphemy at this point.,-2
That’s a hard catch tbf,5
Top fun 10/10,1
Shimron is a shit for giving two chances kings are double shit for not capitalizing on them,1
Bloody hell shit fielding again. Let Maxi take it ffs,4
IPL FIELDING,10
Shithouse fielding,5
"Shami: All you had to do was catch the damn ball, Gowtham",6
"Match Summary so far: Comedy of errors.

A 4 off an edge.

Drop, Yes, No, run out

Missed, appealed with 100% conviction, didnt review

Heaved, long time in air, dropped

And lots of Swing and miss.",7
What is going on this match. Too much happened already in the first two overs Lol.,2
"Man, Shami just bowled a devastating over",1
Test Matchesque Shami,1
"They didn't even for one second consider a review.

That kind of appealing pisses me off.",3
Dude dropping it right in front of maxwell ahah,2
Delhi what is this. It's 2020 not 2014,1
Lmao literally village cricket,2
Jeebus what a fucking start... You absolute nincompoops! How are any of you going to defeat CSK in the finals if you play like you want your mom to come save you?,5
Delhi playing like people who haven't played for a long time due to a global pandemic.,7
Lol what an over,2
Okay. Kids playing on streets can produce more quality cricket.,-2
KXIP dropping Hetmeyer - Ja Shimron jeele apni zindagi,11
Shami is on fire 🔥,1
These 2 overs have been more memeworty than the BBL last year. What the hell is going on?,12
THICC Hetmeyer surviving on a needle.,9
KL going full Parthiv Patel by appealing like mad and then not going for the review,19
Dravid blink twice if they have kidnapped you.,5
~~Kings~~ Villagers XI,10
shami is really dangerous when there's bounce,4
Why is Prithvi running for every nudge?,7
"This is a proper shithouse over, gotta love the efforts all round",5
Where the fuck is now artificial crowd,2
Delhi better pull out a csk win,1
It's his necklace hitting the helmet!!! KL is gesturing so loud but the fucking commentators had no fucking clue!!,6
plz play Rahane in place of Shaw from next match,2
Got a feeling this is gonna be a great match for neutrals,7
"""The bowling team needs a few wickets right now""

-	Kevin Pietersen",5
Was Ashwin dropped or he wanted out?,0
"This team will give me a heart attack, keep your heads lads ffs",9
Hetmyer is better than that,5
Calm ur tits DC!,2
Shami is bowling beautifully. Somehow his bowling looks even more lethal than before,7
Delhi. You break my heart.,5
Please take some singles,3
Who the fuck thought Slater will be the best voice for taking lead in the first two matches of the IPL!,1
Simron looks like the rapper gunna,2
[deleted],4
Shami-Cotrell bowling super Powerplay bowlers,2
Damn did they  not read this pitch?,0
"Looks like there's cursing that these Dubai grounds never see full pack crowd..

First the PSLs 
And now due to covid",1
Hetmeyer is just here for entertainment.,2
Swing and a miss,0
"IPL should give some money to Punjab for a new uniform design, it looks so cheap, you see better uniforms in rec leagues",8
Pant at 5...won't mind that,1
"""post appeal clarity""",10
Is this the same pitch as yesterday?,2
What test match is this.. hit the fuckn ball..,1
this is pornhub for bowling here.,3
People keep forgetting that Punjab have been starting really strong in IPLs for last couple of years.,3
Should have sent Stoinis at 3. Been playing cricket recently and is useful at the top of the order.,2
This is giving me 3am NZ test match vibes,3
Good test match lads,2
Calling it. DC will top the charts. Inverted chart. Boys played well.,2
Get shreyas iyer out there we need a partnership!!!,1
Hetmyer clearly went to Rishabh Pant school of blind slogging.,6
Cottrell Salut incoming.,1
Ah KXIP bowling can be 🔥🔥🔥,2
Shaw is just high on cough drops,2
Murali Kartik does not seem to know what 'indifferent' means.,1
Cottrell has been brilliant so far.,5
First maiden of ipl ?,4
Oh for fucks sake SCORE A BLOODY RUN,4
pant is so gonna choke and i am here for it,4
anyone got a streaming link?,0
Lol these guys are so scratchy. And is it KP? Who's ripping the batsmen?,1
watching pant and hetmyer bat together would make my day💦,1
Kp I love you but pls stop whining about every little thing,4
KP feels personally offended by DCs batting for some reason,3
I've been spoilt listening to Atherton and Hussain all summer. The rest of the world is producing jack shit in terms of commentators,7
"I'm happy the crowd sounds are reduced, but I hope it's not because it's two less popular teams playing",7
So Delhi is just the Brisbane Heat?,4
Too many dots in the power play so far,5
this batting is painful.,11
Kxip dont give me that hope,4
Will Pant be allowed to play given how much he coughs on field?,13
I'd love to see Cottrell do a Salute before Rahul signals 'chain' .lol,5
Lmao that closeup of Dhawan....thinking *this fat fuck got me run out*,22
That whitehat jr ad is cringe.,2
Quality bowling,3
"oh no, why does everyone bat stoin in the middle order",1
Good from Hetmyer and Shaw trying to go through the first session without losing any wicket.,8
Whitehat Jr has genuinely one of the worst ads of all time. WTF is this shit!,7
They lost 7 for 8 last year 😂😂 sounds like the England test team,3
Going by the 3 overs so far I'm certain we're going to be runaway winners this year,7
with such a small back why did Prithvi think its a good idea to have 3 numbers,95
God this hurts so much,6
"Commentary feels very, I don’t what’s the word dodgy ?",4
2.67 run rate. Excellent for test cricket,4
Is DC's bowling good ?,2
That trophy looks really good with the goatee,6
Making Slater read the advertising statements is cruel and unusual punishment,8
The sheikh doesn't know shit thats going on,12
Yess KXIP,5
The Sheikh is still being held hostage after all,15
Sheik looking to steal that cup? /s,6
amitabh bacchan just vibin with the trophy,3
Oh yes prothivi the next sachin himself,2
Simran really needs to breathe a little.,5
"On a side note, I really don’t like these shirt numbers that are 100 and above, the three numbers look terrible on a shirt",4
Sheikh protecting the trophy,4
Looks like the Sheikh is about to give a thumbs up or thumbs down like in those gladiator movies,4
"Less than 3 rr, you love to see it",4
"Shamis so good to watch, have missed watching the big Indian players",4
Delhi's only gameplan is swing and inshallah,7
Kl is always dead faced,4
Is it me or have they reduced the crowd noise by a lot compared to yesterday?,2
Prithvi knew he couldn't complete that run even if he ran for his life,1
To all the kxip supporters join r/kxip. we do fuck all there but might start doing something if we get more people on board,1
Good decision to play both Cottrell and Jordan,1
cough syrup looking real worried,1
pretty sure that guy paid to sit near the trophy,2
Sheikh just chilling with his ~~wine glass~~ trophy.,2
"""me and my trophy""",1
Simran playing like a gully cricketer. Close you eyes and swing the bat every ball hoping you will connect one,1
"This match seems more boring than my life

But I'm still watching it. 

Kill me please :'(",5
Dhawan looks like he has a murder to do,5
Hetmeyer and Pant are from same school of batting. Talented but brainless. Coincidentally they were the same batch who played that 2016 U19 WC where they were star performers for their respective teams but that is where they still remain still with that U19 mindset.,2
"Alright so going for King's 11, what's the go to nickname for them cos I cannot be arsed saying King's 11 all the time",3
Wtf are these guys doing,6
BOAT - Bestest Of All Time?,3
LETS GOOOO,2
Poor batting ffs,1
"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck delhi",3
Proper Shithousery this..,4
bruh,3
Reckless,3
Lmao this is amazing,2
Piece of shit shot,3
Lmfao this is so shithouse from DC,6
"Nice, run out the senior batsman, then play a stupid shot to get out.",6
Cough syrup is out,6
Jeeeez DC... What the fuck. This is going to be a wallopping.,3
CHUTIYE AUR PEHEN GOGGLES,5
Delhi Crapitals,4
And they are showing dhawan on screen now 😆,8
This is CPL level bad batting,6
Lack of experience bad shot selection,3
DC village,5
Barbadi,3
Prithvi here thrown two wickets,5
Murli Karthik and KP are the worst commentators ever and they are on air together now.,3
prithvi never looked comfortable.,2
Bc Delhi why you do this to me everytime?,2
Lmao ofcourse you choose dumb prithvi over Rahane,3
"That's king of Dubai right ? Whose daughter we returned, instead of sending her to his estranged wife",2
Shaw as always..,2
Stoinis pls come,2
"What was that shot?! 

sorry *shit*",4
Lmao.. I kept saying last year Shaw is overrated and not of international quality yet.. proves..,2
Proper swing and hope batting,1
"last year had me hyped, guess it's back to the wooden spoon for us",2
"Lmao...Sachin 2.0

They have the same T20 skill, at least

Hopefully they have the same Test skill",2
Shami OP,1
Dhawan about to skin Shaw alive when he gets back,5
Bad shot,1
Finally they deleted f-ing vuvuzelas,2
Cmon bruh not in the first match of the season,2
Shami gonna feast on some milk to celebrate tonight,5
This is completely normal phenomenon.,2
DC back to form after last year's misfortune.,4
pretty zinta-,6
😭😭😭,2
"**3.3** Mohammed Shami to Shaw, OUT, **taken at mid-on!** More reckless cricket from Delhi against good bowling. **9-2**

PP Shaw c Jordan b Mohammed Shami 5 (9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.55",2
Lmfaooooo Prithvi 👎🏽,2
Delhi being Delhi,3
Good now we can see some actual batting from iyer,3
My boi Rahul gonna get that cup for real !,1
They’re all very rusty,3
Dhawan looks pissed. Shaw is in for a beating.,5
Who said Prithiv is the next Sachin?,1
Shaw really needs to grow up. This shit after 2 years in ipl.,3
Ok DC fans it's all over for today,3
He's now Prithvi Haw.,2
Looks like Stoinis will be opening anyway lmao,3
Jesus Prithvi Shaw isn't getting anywhere he looks the exact same as last year,2
I am still supporting delhi this season,2
Fuck yes,2
This might be biased but I think Hetmyer is at fault here. He has played far too many dots.,2
Shikhar Dhawan : menu dukh diya tha tussi,4
"Runs dhawan out, now fucks himself off.

Nice going cough syrup.",11
"May have to revise predictions, Delhi's batsmen look rusty af",5
"2 drops, some awful shots, yet the worst thing in this game is the commentary FFS",6
Damn they really fooled us with all those behind the scene training videos. Bums.,37
This match gonna be over in an hour,5
Were ambanis in the house yesterday?? I see Preeti today,3
Real good test match going on here,3
kp is fuming lmao,8
This batting is triggering my Brissy Heat ptsd,5
Lol they can’t protect wickets or score runs. What a team!,2
Imagine getting your ass handed by KXIP in the PP after reaching playoffs in the previous edition.,3
all that tik tok training has got to DC.,5
"Great showing, Shaw.  Can Shreyas please put some runs on the board here?",2
"Had high expectations from Shaw.

Turning out to be the next Unmukt Chand",6
Where's Roy?,3
Ok will KXIP take follow on ?,5
Same old same old Delhi,4
now I see Ajinkya playing from next match every match for his sane mind,4
grill em kp,2
My god the DC folks look so depressed,4
Shaw going to pharmacy for cough syrup... Lol,3
"What did I say, what did I fucking say, new it! 

""I reckon KXIP today, backing CJ to take one or two""
From earlier today",2
RCB > DC,4
Shaw needs to learn batting from Shaw Academy,2
The batting has been such a pity so far . Boycotts mom would have batted better,2
"Obligatory - if they can make it to the end if the first session, Delhi can Capitalise",7
It’s Pant’s night. I can feel it.,3
They could've given us 15 minutes of hope before fucking it up at least...,4
Why did they not send Stoinis/Iyer at 3.,1
How ya doin Delhi fanbois?,0
"Fuck Aakash Chopra, ruining my experience.",2
Finally,3
Prithvi overrated shaw,5
Shaw has to be dropped for Rahane next game. Period.,2
Absolute rubbish batting by the 2 Indian international batsmen.,3
Is iyer not playing?,5
"Prithvi Shaw knows that with his footwork, no team owner is gonna want him, well almost no team owner.

That's why he's trying to get in the good graces of Preity Zinta by handing the game over to KXIP.",5
What kinda shot was that? Playing it square was surely a better option?,2
It was the same ball you morons. Blame the execution not the idea,2
Wtf Delhi!!😒,1
I wonder who wants to see random people on zoom call in middle of a circket match,1
Our jersey sucks donkey balls,3
KP is tearing into DC,2
"Matches this IPL gonna be low Scoring, not sure how to feel about that",3
Angry commentating KP is best KP commentary tbh,5
This DC team really need Rahane cool at top for their hothead top-order,2
"Ok that's enough for KG and Anrich to defend, declare and get KXIP in there",2
Shami is bowling beautifully..,3
"Is the art of getting 1 and 2's if players are struggling to score boundaries just dead now. So many players in the CPL just couldn't pick up singles, it was embarrassing to watch",2
"KP going in, damn.",2
Is Kl 6 foot tall ?,4
Shaw - Dhawan performing same as their Tiktoks,9
I'm late to the party. But what are these god awful jerseys?,6
Why would you look for a single at third man when there's slip already. 🤦,4
Explain cough syrup joke,2
Anyone knows the average of this pitch?,5
Hetmyer looks clueless af,7
[deleted],6
Shaw gonna maintain some real social distance with Shikhar in that dugout,8
"LOL.

Another one. Hahahah DC",2
Madarcho,4
Lmao wtf is happening,3
Lol pack of cards....,5
Pack up Bois.,4
Damn bro. Under 50 all out?😂,2

Oh god almighty.,2
Lol,3
The fuck is this. Lmao 😂,7
"Lmao, what the hell",3
DC back to roots again,4
SHAMI STAPH. I CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT,3
Second innings Shami has turned up in the first innings itself today!,5
FML,4
Hahahahaha this is amazing,1
Oh my god,1
Wow,1
Delhi you beauty,5
Hahahaha collapse time baby,2
"*Dudduboi* for the purple cap, bois.",4
Shami you BEAUT!,4
"DJ KHALED

ANOTHER ONE",1
I CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT,5
"Ahahaha Delhi you, oh you",7
New season.. same level of shit house batting by DC...,8
"Aur banao behenchod, tik tok, fucking tik tok personalities",6
OMFG,4
It's fun to watch a class bowler boss these domestic bashers.,3
I want my refund,6
Nita Ambani we're coming for you,8
Absolutely rubbish shot by Shaw!!!,4
"WHYYYYY, they really want to ruin my day ffs",7
Shami masterclass.,5
"Need an Idli, Pant partnership",3
Delhi Chutiyas,4
Batting collapse imao,3
hahahahaha,6
I can listen to KP commentary all day instead of gavaskar and Karthik sucking Indian batsmans dick.,2
Batting collapse is their speciality,2
Shamiiii,2
Mah man Shami! Always great to see him doing well.,1
RIP Sunday of Delhi ki public.,2
Dude ...,1
Okay this is Cartoon Network batting,1
"Seriously?  I'm not discounting good bowling, but what the hell is this?",2
Shami and his seam position - so good.,1
"Lmao goodnight lads, better time to sleep",1
This is Johannesburg,1
lol DC's batting is completely shit outside of Pant and Dhawan.,1
KP just throws completely random words in every time he’s on comms,3
Who said Shami this is second innings?,2
Inb4 Mishraji saves the day,1
Ordering Shami kabab for dinner tonight,4
DC lacking in the IQ department?,6
"I'll see you all next DC match, had enough already",6
Is this test being played at cape town?,2
One more over of Shami and the game's over lol,7
All those prediction threads about how strong DC are,7
"**3.6** Mohammed Shami to Hetmyer, OUT, **taken at short extra cover!** Oh boy, the shot selection is just not showing up today. **13-3**

SO Hetmyer c Agarwal b Mohammed Shami 7 (13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 53.84",4
DC playing like BC,5
Wasn’t shami in Delhi before?,3
So I guess it doesn't matter if pant bats at 4 or 5,3
`C O L L A P S E`,5
"Shami you beauty, making use of the pitch very well",8
Watching shami bowl again feeling so refreshed. Enjoying his bowling,6
Be very Scared Australia.,3
DC needs Rahane on his pitch atleast,6
India's middle order out to do the firefighting.,7
49 all out?,3
A respectable total lies in this partnership between Iyer and Hetmeyer,2
I'm not revising inorganic chemistry for this match. Don't mess this pls.,3
Why do i support this fucking team FML,5
Hetmyer is really bad at t20 cricket. Might as well bring in Ragane to stabilize the top order.,2
[deleted],2
RCB DNA,5
Oh man,1
"Wtf this is 2020,why are we going through 2018 time line. I was promised delhi Bangalore final",3
INKI MKC. MEI JAARA VALORANT KHELNE BYE,7
Punjab's batting stops at Maxwell but looks like that would be enough,5
"Shami comes into attack, commentators start appreciating his seam position💦💦",7
"Delhi have fucked themselves going for that unnecessary left-right combo.

FFS if you want to send a foreigner at 3 it should be Stoinis.",7
The reason why RCB left Hetty😂,3
Punter looking up jobs for 2021 lol,6
Saying this since ever shami >> bumrah,6
"😂😞

When you have both shami and Shaw in your fantasy team",5
A great failure,3
Delhi Daredevils ?,6
TIL DELHI'S IPL TEAM IS MOST BALANCED WITH GREAT LOCAL TALENT.,8
Mohammed Shami is so unbelievably good. Could have had four,3
"I don't understand why DC fans are sad, they're clearly trying to break all IPL records this year - including the lowest total.",5
Rahane is the man of the hour.,2
Tiktok disasterclass,4
Ashwin hoping they accidentally (ethically) put him on the Punjab Team Sheet,4
Now waiting for Rishab to replicate his wc semi final performance to cap this off.,1
shami hero aada hero,2
"Let me say it ..
Next match stoinis should open with Dhawan. He was tremendous in Big bash. Shaw should make way fo Rahane who can bat at 3 and provide solidity... Ponting needs to take hard decisions cos this is brain-dead batting going on..",5
"Meh, IPL is overrated, I mean who even watches it anyway? 🥱",6
Need to drop the capitals. Bring back Gujarat Lions.,3
This ball is moving around more than you'd see a red cherry move in England after a shower,1
Murali Kartik just said Shami should've had 3. Does he mean that he should've recalled Hetmyer if that first catch was taken?,3
HOLY FUCK I'M LOVING THIS PLEASE BEAT OUR RECORD,11
Ashwin reconsidering the move rn,5
"KP: I dont like being harsh at young batsman...

You destroyed the confidence of a young James Taylor coz you were jealous, mate",8
Is this going to be the first Collapse™ of this IPL?,6
Shami you beauty!!!,5
Young partnership? If pant goes boom boom I'll go to Dubai personally and whoop his ass,6
"This whole Delhi squad and their demeanor gives me sad vibes.

Did someone die or what?!",6
get all out less than 48,2
DC trying to break RCB's record here of 48,7
Shami is soo fuckin good right now.,3
Wow the batting is so ordinary,3
"They still have guys, I'm not counting them out yet",3
[removed],8
Why are all batsmen so intent on playing against the swing? smh,6
Desi Homelander on fire 🔥,8
Yeah lets throw in more brainless hitters when we need someone to stabilize the innings.,8
It’s not even that they are taking shots and getting out....it’s a run rate of 3,2
Rahane should be playing somewhere to anchor,3
Ooof size: mega,2
IPLs back!! Can't wait for my team to crush the first half of the tournament and shit the bed the nexthalf again!!!   \O/,5
With dew expected in second half the match is as good as gone,1
Og shreyas pant back,5
RIP the hypothetical RCB vs DC final,6
Looks like we all can switch to the Chelsea Liverpool game from the kickoff tonight.,2
"Bold of me to make 2 packs of maggi to sit down and eat while I support Delhi.
Looks like I'll be done quick.",3
So did pant come in this early previously?,3
Shaw still has time but he's becoming a liability with his recklessness and running. And there are people behind him like Jaiswal and Paddikal who could make it to the national team.,2
Please hang on delhi,1
Hopefully we get some sixes from pant,1
We gonna rock down to electric Avenue and then we Shreyas Iyer,2
"of COURSE I HAD TO PICK DHAWAN SHAW AND HETMYER IN DREAM11

FUCK",2
Shami >>> Bumrah,3
Put one more slip already !,1
"Ball is moving, if Shirt takes his time instead of swinging, there is a chance for DC.",1
Dc had no experienced batsman other than dhawan today. what were they thinkng? Rahane has to play.,4
50 all out.,1
Kings XI fucked by taking so many wickets early.... Now best of DC will play for 16 overs,2
Hopefully Pant realises that they're 3 down and it's only the 5th and not the 19th over.,5
Isn't this was the time to float Stoinis ?,2
Why do a the batsmen look fucking clueless? 😭,3
Another year another DD sepuku,3
Wickets keep coming and Stoinis might end up coming in where he's actually effective,6
[deleted],3
Looks like Shami upgraded himself during the resting time. He's bowling fire balls with a seam as steady as a surgeon's hand,7
DC gonna get out by 8th over,2
"Maybe unpopular opinion: pant should play freely here, its the only way back into the game.",1
Delhi capitals strikes again lol,6
running like headless chickens between the wickets,4
Is it just me or is the crowd noise a little more bearable today? Not so loud I think.,5
Similar situation the last time pant and iyer did a great partnership to bring the score to 180.,4
"Looking forward to Iyer getting out hit wicket next over, or something",3
Delhi has consistently been the most overrated team in IPL history.,3
LOL this game!,2
Lmao,3
IPL fielding™,5
"Last time Pant was this early, India were 5/3 in a world cup semi final.",77
He wanted the hat lmao,4
"Capitals allowing Stoinis to face as many deliveries as he can early on, like how he dominated the BBL, but by batting him at six and completely collapsing",7
Pain,5
Bruh,2
ye game toh gayi bc,3
Mishra-esque fielding,7
When are they going to unleash the Ultimate weapon Ashwin?,3
Hahahhahahaha.... lmao... Bbl level fielding .. absolute village,3
Lol fielding continues,4
Jesus the fielding has been poor so far this IPL,6
Calling 25-4,3
Hahahah village cricket,4
I swear this is fucking village today,4
Well Ashwin promoted himself to no.4 a couple of times last year. I think he would have to come up the order a lot of times in DC,6
That hurts,4
Absolute village.,3
batting stoin at 6? DC deserve to lose this,9
What the fuck is that outfield made of? Jeez!!,7
Pant gonna save dc like how batman out to save the dc universe?,4
Except Faf fielding has been so poor,3
Scene is set for Ashwin to score 100*(25).,8
Pant is back with his cough.,5
Inb4 shreyas and pant do a faf and Rayudu,6
Need a captain's knock here from Shreyas,5
Shami lucky guy. Picking wickets due to Bumrah at other end..... On wait,8
Villiagiest match ever,3
I P L F I E L D I N G,2
Grass on the pitch? Rahane should be an automatic selection. If not opening at least at 3.,2
International cricket is good and all but you can't beat one of the various meme leagues for out and out laughter,5
"I’m not sure why the capitals have bothered playing Stoinis considering that he is an excellent top order batsman, but an unusually bad lower order batsman/finisher

He really doesn’t offer enough with the ball to justify his selection if he is batting at 6 or 7.",5
"Okay seriously who the fuck switched my feed to a local gully cricket match? 

This is NOT the standard I expect from an IPL match",7
"My grandmom saw that fielding attempt and asked if Pakistani players are allowed in ipl now.

F",87
What's this outfield. Isn't this supposed to be international quality,7
BBL ~~BATTING~~ ~~RUNNING~~ TEAM.,1
Dude u can get yo ligamemt doing those lame ass stunts on Field,3
dElHi CoLlApSiTaLs,3
Waiting for Delhi to open with Dhawan and Rahane soon and reincarnate the god awful 2016 T20 wc memories,4
Simon Jones PTSD whenever this happens.,3
Yesterday's Philding kumar is today's Philding-preet,3
Excellent way to hurt your ACL and/or MCL,4
Id rather have stoinis open with dhawan then rahane at 3,5
Shot,3
Shot,3
RCB fans must rooting for anything less than 49,10
Lmao welcome back Delhi Daredevils,8
top effort to save it even after falling down,5
KP has been funny on comms today,5
Very close to how Simon Jones got injured,5
Sweet shot,3
Why is shitmeyer in the team?,6
Dropped shami for dhawan in dream 11. fucckkkk.,6
Hey I'm new to the game. What is DRS? Official review?,5
How do you guys feel about low Scoring IPL,3
Shot bud,3
Good old Indian 21/3 😊,7
"Langer > ponting, atleast he made stoinis play at the top",5
Looks like repeat of this match https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/scorecard/1082626/kings-xi-punjab-vs-delhi-daredevils-36th-match-indian-premier-league-2017,2
"MoSha is killing it, more fiery than Bumrah, too bad T20 WC postponed to next year",5
If this performance continues kejriwal should do a dharna next match in Feroz Shah kotla,15
Which Chris Jordan are we getting today?,4
world of difference betwen Pant and Iyer vs all the batsmen who got out,6
"Show me some Intent™, DC!",3
"Pant gonna get that almost permanent blue jersey spot after this IPL, mark my words.",7
I hope Pant gives a big fuck u to all his doubters and this sub,8
Will dc be this years pakistan,-1
Shami's rhythm and his deliveries landing on that seam are a sight to watch,6
What a cut!,2
GOAT ashwin will save DC.,5
Pant bro please get a century today,6
Deep down we all gonna miss sexual tension between KP and Mayanti,10
It would be interesting to see dhawan and stoinis open,4
Next IPL is also in UAE,4
Looks like delhi team haven't forgot their theme song 'aa khele front foot pe'. Bhaiya 2 ball toh thik jao,9
"Saw an article today posted here that chastisised India for expecting Pant to play sensibly when he is the first quintessential Indian T20 batsman.

Want to know what Delhi is hoping for? The sensible play or the quintessential Pant.",3
"This is why I always root for Shami to be in the ODI 11 all the time when he is fit. He is an out and out strike bowler and I don't care how many runs he leaks. You need one like that upfront to cause that damage to opposition early.

He can always be used for an extended spell of 6 overs early on and 2 overs in the middle and max 2 at the death. Bumrah will also benefit from the pressure Shami puts early on with his skiddy pace that rushes the batsman.

6 + 2 + 2  or 5 + 3 + 2.",9
dc seems like this years shithouse team,8
DC memelords to get 69 all out,1
Is Jordan really that much of a better bowler than neesh tbh?,4
Pant's shot selection today in this situation will probably gives us a clear picture on his future with Indian cricket. Let's see what he does.,7
Did I just see Pant defend??,4
Omg the ipl ads are so cringy they need to take a leaf from the super bowl ads....,7
Shami better get the next over,7
Kings XI bowling themselves out of the game by getting closer and closer to bringing The Oil Rig in early,8
No fake crowd noises? They def toned it down,9
"Perhaps unpopular opinion but Rahane should play over Shaw, he had an avg of 32 and SR of 137 last season. Shaw averaged 22 with SR of 133.",0
And then they were 3,1
"For 1 run, Delhi wants to risk their wicket. Every batsmen has come with this intention.",2
Why does Jio needs to do these shitty ads? Almost everyone has their card anyway,4
"I feel Rahane is needed in DC due to lack of exp in batting lineup

Hetmyr is way too careless. Execept Dhawan you have no one to stop the collapse


what do you think?",1
2020 is indeed an odd year. 2nd inning Shami getting wickets in 1st spell.,23
Every tall guy in KXIP looks like Ashwin lol,10
Glenmol Singh Maxwell jeete raho,10
Jay Shah checking this match thread rn.,7
Ganguly chillin,2
Even Dada looks bored.,3
Dada's swag forever,4
"Spending that much money and an overseas slot on Stoinis to bat him 6 makes zero sense to me.

He might get in early today, but in general, he’s a slow starter who has had *far* more success at the top of the order.",10
Ganguly doesn't need a mask his death stare is enough,6
Shami looks unplayable today,9
So the commentators take turns doing coke in the dugout,6
[deleted],2
Need 4 slips and a gully smh,3
Delhi's winning it this year imho,5
Sourav Ganguly: Glad I left Delhi,4
"They are doing a pretty good job with the fake crowd today, right?",3
"I think it's immature to compare but who remembered when Ian Bishop compared Shami to Bumrah, in particular their bowling actions and how they will sustain in the long-run? 

Bumrah had his first ever major injury and has been out of form since NZ. I think this is a strong sign because of his unconventional action and I hate to say it but I don't think he will sustain in the long-run. I'm sorry. Shami, on the other hand, will be able to sustain in the long-run and I believe that most of us can agree that he has actually been getting better and better ever since his injury.

Now I'm making this comparison because I'm looking at how they are both sustaining after their injuries. For Shami, it has been an upward trend in performance since his injury. For Bumrah, so far it has been a downward trend and I believe it will continue to be a downward trend unfortunately.

Downvote it all you want, I know there are many Bumrah fans here..but I'd like to have a constructive conversation.",2
Poor ganguly he has to watch every match and specially teams like delhi punjab.,5
Looking at Ganguly's mask gives me an impression that he will make a really bad Batman.,3
Lads why was the ipl in the UAE a few years ago? Just money reasons or something?,2
Having this strong feeling of Bishnoi getting a proper Tonking from pant 🤪,3
I knew DC was going to lose and I am still disappointed.,2
Shami is too OP for both DC and KXIP,6
When Ashwin comes out I'm gonna cheer for my Boy,5
DC should open with rahane and dhawan. Rahane will be very useful on these pitches.,1
DC could've sent a Marcus Stoinis up the order knowing he got a hundred last year in d BBL,9
Players are looking lot fitter than yesterday match,5
"It's mind-blowing how Dada became the most powerful man in cricket so soon. I mean, we saw it coming but this is fast.",7
COVER YOUR NOSE DADA FFS,2
Ew the numbers on the jerseys are so low you can't even see their names,1
Immunity Booster™ is the newest buzz word for all the ads this IPL season,7
[deleted],48
Who is that chu beside Ganguly?,9
Chris Jordan “handy at the death” klaxon!,2
These fans are cringe,5
Finish Shami early. Iyer and pant gone is game over....,1
Isn't it a conflict of interest for Ganguly to be president of BCCI and also serve as mentor to DC and to be ambassador for MycircleXI app at same time ?!,18
I don't know much about cricket but this DC team looks weak.,2
Gungly please wear mask over nose.,1
Collapse incoming?,3
How tf is ball zipping around like that? Never expected such bowling conditions at this venue.,2
Very uneven wicket ffs,0
It's only natural for a famed Indian top order to collapse in foreign conditions in day 1. walk on lads nothing new to see here.,53
Which team is Amir Mishra playing for?,1
[deleted],5
orgasmic seam position.,5
Don't know the name but current commentator who is from Zim is very good.,4
Hotstar should give an option to watch the match without the fake sounds.,2
And this is not even second innings Shami.,2
Slo mo footage stuttering for anyone else as well?,2
DC batting looks weaker than RCB.,3
How many do Delhi need here?,2
Do we have Ian Bishop and Nasser on the roaster as commentators ?,3
"Damn how good is Shami? He's like a workhorse that just keeps on running in and bowling at a consistent pace be it ODIs, Tests or T20s.",5
I love this version of Shami. With the personal domestic troubles he saw himself in - A lot of player careers would have gone sideways . He has uplifted his game and fitness instead,17
Kings XI = Lagaan XI.,16
"Pomie is right i am also shocked shami is on the money from ball one.


No second innings shami anymore.",5
Shami had previously taken just seven wickets in 80 Powerplay overs (1-6) in IPL in 42 innings till IPL 2019. Today is the first instance of him taking more than one wicket in this phase.,2
Such accurate wrists on my boy Shami. Why would anyone want to break up with him! 🙄 He's a banger™,17
Hey DC! I demand a collapse right now..,1
It's not the team it's the pitch...,0
DC picked so many average overseas players. They could've shelled out a bit more for a decent player like Morgan.,2
Shami is the best at maintaining that seam position. Sreesanth had that earlier and now Shami.,3
I never understood why the fuck people wear gloves to protect against covid. Like you're still gonna be touching your face,1
Such a straight wrist the wrist is so straight,5
Stoinis is useless at no.6. RCB already tried him.,4
Dehli capitals? More like Dehi CRAPitals.,1
This is a heroically low run rate,4
Preeti still a looker,2
I could watch Shami bowl for days,5
Zinta so Pretty,1
Delhi Punjab and Bangalore should form a pact of bottom 3 and pledge to never drag each others Nrr down significantly.,5
Iyer looks sexy boi in ads.,3
"I'd argue that Archer probably has the best bouncer, but yes, Shami has a killer seam position.",8
Fuck that music would be annoying.,3
Shami on song is fucking brilliant.,9
"G1climax in the first half of the day, IPL in the second on both Sat and Sun.. has been an entertaining weekend so far... Hope Delhi plays a bit better so that we see a good match again today",3
Preity with the gloves.,2
Man the light flickering in the slow motion shots will give me an epilepsy.,2
Shami or Bumrah?,2
[deleted],3
"Unpopular Opinion, Shami > Bhuvi in T20.",3
Does Preity Zinta own a lot of stake in the team? She can't be rich enough to pay crores of money every year to the players,2
Shami is bullying the kids atm :),5
"Watching Shami bowl, without much crowd noise is just so hypnotic",7
Is this the unheard of First ~~Second~~ innings Shami,2
Pant really needs to work on his fitness as well. He is a young lad,2
Shami ripped out his old team Delhi. Now wait for Ashwin in the second innings to pull off something special against his old team Punjab,7
Hair is overrated when you can bowl like that.,7
[deleted],5
[deleted],5
"Ah yes, budget Ravi Ashwin.",7
Where to watch the match if I don't want to subscribe to hotstar?,2
thumbs up if you knew shami would achieve great things ever since 2013-2014.,1
"Dont understand why wouldn't punter let stoinis come in , forcing the left right too much?",2
"Delhi team is always okay but the lineups are so fucked.

Like you have to be incredibly dumb to select Stoinis and not open with him.",3
Preity Zinta hot AF,5
"Even if Maxwell scores a duck, I will forever be grateful to him for that century",2
It’s nice to see that the Delhi top order are honouring Jay Shah by deciding to bat like him.,2
Shamwow,1
Love Gowtham I don't know why.,3
Hot take:Gautam should be in T20 squad,2
Preity ❤️,1
[deleted],1
Roar macha? Delhi using tamil word?,3
The team with Dhawan and Pant batting is running at just over 3 runs an over in a T20..,1
Krishnapa Gowtham 32 years old young spinner ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯,5
Are they playing at Sharjah?,2
"So bizarre to see Jonty not in MI's dugout. Also Shami is losing hair, welcome to the club Shamibhai.",8
Gowtham's action of so similar to Ashwin that I thought Ashwin was bowling against his own team,2
The match is so boring that I'm starting to reflect on all the wrong decisions I've taken in life.,7
Of all people punter making stoinis bat down the order. Would have swapped positions of stoinis and hetmeyar,7
just started unconsciously singing jio dhan dhana dhan please help me,11
ashwin the finisher padded up.,6
Ashwin padded up already hmm,4
My boy Sarfaraz looking dank af!,5
Probably lowest PP score I have seen in a long time. 23/3 in 6 overs.,6
kings xi kit gives the impression that they bought it off the shelf from decathlon,8
why does Ashwin have his pads on. Does he have no faith in the batting line up,16
Can someone remind me what the intent meme was,6
"I went to the tailors last week to get some new trousers fitted and decided to try this new place that my mate KP had suggested. They did an excellent job and sell really nice trousers but I couldn’t help but get slightly creeped out in the shop as the have pictures of Mohammed Shami everywhere. Every wall was covered with photos of Shami wearing different pairs of trousers, India test ones, T20I ones, even ones from a promotional shoot before the 2019 IPL. When I was leaving the shop I decided I had to ask why the fascination with Mohammed Shami. Was it a sponsorship deal? A relative? I asked the owner “Mikey, what is it about Mohammed Shami that is so special?”. The shop owner simply replied “Mohammed Shami! His seam position is exceptional” and then walked off into the night.",100
This is first time in IPL that Shami conceded less than 10 runs when bowling 3 overs in powerplay in IPL,12
"Comm: Gowtham bowls wicket to wicket

Gowtham: bowls all 3 balls outside off",6
Pant just slaps the ball lovingly,3
Why did RR release K Goutham?,4
"Good odi match to watch, don't know why people are not happy",4
"They are gonna send Ashwin b4 Stoin, aren't they?",7
Our DC just poor or is this a 130-140 wicket?,5
What are these blackouts in hotstar dugout stream?? Totally sucks,2
Why's Iyer sweating already?,0
Shami's rise in all 3 formats has been a blessing for India,62
Pant always looks like he bats without giving a singular fuck.,8
BG crowd noise is just fine today. They are syncing it nicely lmao,10
Show me more Preityyy,15
Did they completely remove the crowd cheers or is it due to DC not hitting boundaries. Match feels dead as fuck. I'd rather they keep playing some music tbf. This is CPL level bad rn.,3
"Rusty fielding so far. Guess lockdown affected the players in only fielding somehow? Naaah, I guess.",5
I will lose it if they send Ashwin ahead of Stonknis,5
Yet another test match in the making,6
Delhi will be looking to score more runs here,3
"This is 130-140 pitch. Dean Jones also talk about it. Only if either of these two, play till the 20th over.",1
"Ok KL. 4 words, Hindi. Old or new?",2
No crowd noise on Dugout. Just realised.,5
"The normal English commentary has been a lot better so far this IPL

Less advertising shills, no Danny Morrison horseshit, no Sanju. Actually been pretty bearable",27
 someone stop shami from ageing.,3
I wonder whether it was worth sending Ravikashyap Ashwin at 4 to do a Badrinath.,3
I love what Shami has done here. Nothing works for fitness as good as a break-up.,43
"Wtf DC, so much potential in your squad and yet your 27/3 after 7",2
So when does Bishnoi get the ball ??,3
Inb4 Pant gets caught at deep square leg playing a fancy shot.,2
"No Ricky, you cannot ~~do~~ touch your face like that! 😷",2
28 dots. Thats nearly 5 overs out of a total 7 overs.,3
Iyer smoked Punjab last year!,3
[deleted],5
I don't hear fake crowd noise in this match...do any of you?,1
"was iyer picked for the 2019 world cup?


edit: thanks for the response guys",1
"In b4 the 4 teams that will qualify are CSK, MI,  SRH and KKR and 2020 suddenly looks normal",6
"**Mohammed Shami in the powerplay in IPL before today**

79 overs

671 runs

7 wickets

8.59 ER

Today - 3 overs 8 runs 2 wickets",8
Did they remove the fake crowd noise?,2
Ngl I love watching these two bat together,5
Jordan bowling filth,1
When's strategic timeout?,3
Is Ishant Sharma injured or something? Why Mohit Sharma is preferred over him?,2
Fuck altroz,1
Dugout glitchy for someone else as well?,2
Why have there not been asany Clean stops by fielding units as you would expect? Something to do with long break? Or grounds?,1
Why did we retain Gayle and not Curran ?,1
Tata Altroz is one sexy car,3
Did Simon Doull just have SCurran in his list of gun fielders?,1
"I'm confused, it it bad batting by DC? 

Good bowling from KXIP? 

Weird pitch??",3
Is hotstar flickering for anyone else,1
Iyer and pant auditioning for the test team here,4
Delhi are just memeing at the moment,5
Gayle wouldn’t fit in that car.,23
Jordan is so underrated today. He's one of the best T20 bowlers around. Good for the Kings.,9
nvm delhi top order came onto the field just to count the number of ACKO posters to win the contest. They went back as soon as the task was completed,4
Test season has arrived early.,2
Is it possible to keep crowd cheering for players in the stadium? How about placing a surround sound speakers around the stadium to give that effect. I am sure we have that technology at disposal.,2
You could generate so much energy from Rishabh Pant swinging his bat everytime,3
They'll have no option but to attempt to murder the spinners if batting against pace is gonna be this difficult.,3
would people have shami in their all time Indian XIs for all 3 formats?,2
Want to watch dugout but stuck with Hindi commentary because my siblings are watching with me,2
"How many jerseys do players usually have?
Like are they washed every time and used again. Seems the logical conclusion. But somehow these high level athletes doing it  doesn't feel right.",2
Wow Nair you bird,1
I just want someone to hit a six onto that bloody car so that it's not shown anymore.,4
If someone told me to describe the car my mum would've tried to make me buy when I bought my first car it would be that car.,5
"is it just me or do all Indian cricketers look a bit fatter now?

Shaw, Pant, Rohit etc",2
Suddenly the batting heavy delhi side looks crap now,6
First time I've seen 30/3 this summer and couldn't care less,3
Imo fielding better than yesterday’s match,2
Karun so happy lol,5
Does Karun nair remember he has a test match 300?,8
Pant wants his place back in the test team.,4
"I'm hoping that upcoming Aus Ind test series to be dominated by fast bowlers, instead of winning toss and batting decisions.",1
"I feel like a kid picking teams again, I have zero awareness of either team or there histories, but am following the red team because of Maxi.",13
Fck there comes fcking stupid dumb cricket polls on ipl,-1
Lol look at the beaming smile of Kaptain Nair!,3
I don’t know about you guys but i like test cricket anyway. So i am enjoying this.,4
I see that Sarfraz's trimmer has a longer battery life than Dhoni's.,3
i hate how i’m only 4km from the stadium and i can’t even watch the match live,3
"Oh god, they ain't even trying.",3
The target is >48. I think we will get there,8
"**Worst DC powerplay totals**

21/3 - vs KXIP 2013 (Loss)

22/3 - vs GL 2016 (Loss)

**23/3 - vs KXIP 2020 (Today)**

28/1 - vs KXIP 2016 (Won)

28/2 - vs CSK 2015 (Won)",9
"To get into the IPL, gonna sport my local. Come on Punjab. Always been a glory Mumbai supporter",3
"It's not Karun Nair you ass, the name is Kaptain Karun Kanteerava Kotigobba Krantiveera Kaladharan Nair.",4
"I like this match better than that of yesterday. Probably, I'm partial to up and coming players for India.",3
Will be interesting to see Mujeeb bowling on this pitch. Delhi us playing with thier top 2 spinners.,2
If these two bat till tea then DC will have a chance imo,5
"Irfan Pathan: Pant hit a unique shot last year so he's more innovative.

Context: who is more innovative Maxwell or Pant?",5
How is that even a question? Maxwell once left a ball that went on to uproot his middle stump. If that's not innovation I don't know what is,8
"Is it really ""innovative"" to use the reverse sweep? It's one of the most common shots in T20 cricket.",4
pant swinging >>> windmill,2
hope we let iyer play at 4 in the odi team,2
After the first session DC are going at 32-3 will be back shortly for the second session after this over,2
DC batting strength doesn't make an sense why did they traded for Rahane they even had Roubin the sqaud no proper finisher it's all a mess,2
Can someone remind DC that they only have 20 overs,2
"10 an over takes DC to 152. 

Average Winning first innings score on this ground  161.",3
if they had bonus points in the IPL it would make the one sided games more interesting,3
"Oi, MS is featuring in more ads after retirement than before.",4
Rabada and co can blow away KXIP if these fucks can get to 150-160.,6
Delhi batting looked so good on paper.,3
"as much as people love batting, you have to realise that the bowling is what makes the matches actually interesting. because good bowling can test batting and when the best of the best overcome GOOD bowling, that's peak cricket for you.

You will see batsmen nourish on bowling pitches more than bowlers nourish on batting pitches so having conditions that favour bowlers is ultimately just levelling the playing field.",2
I wish they used the Friends laugh track,3
Oh no. Selmonbhoi y u say swag. It sends chills down my spine.,3
Oh shot,4
GO PANT,2
"Not a good team selection by DC. Hetmyer was a 1-2 match show in CPL, Carey would have been a better preference. Also believe that Rahane is an ideal opening option with Dhawan.",5
Maa chod di,3
Imagine if he fell onto his stumps there,8
Yes Panty. Show 'em what you got,6
These iPhone advertisements have started to sound like their users,8
Signature shot,5
Almost tuned off cause rishab wasn't falling over enough,3
Pants down.,3
Heyy! I missed Rishabh 'I lost my balance while slogging' Pant.,5
[deleted],1
Wtf pant. What was that,3
I am just waiting for rabada,1
That advertisement said “Kingfisher- premium packaged drinking water”. Wut?,2
Where's Harsha,2
I have an ominous feeling that Maxi is gonna destroy teams in this IPL.,5
That shot from Pant is his most productive (and destructive) option,3
Why does pant always falls over playing shots ? When will he learn to balance himself,2
is replay screen flashing or only my sky sports,1
Anyone know if Mujeeb is gonna be in the team in the future? He is the main reason I'm supporting Punjab tbh,1
Whenever I see Rishabh going like that I know his time has come.... To go back.,4
How do I have a team next to my username it looks so cool!,2
The falling down shot is a part of pant's game at this point,17
"Come on Pant and Iyer, show the world that you are the future middle order for India.",10
How is CRED spending so much money on advertising? They have absolutely no business model that can make them any money.,3
Why has Gowtham changed his side whole bowling to Pant now?,2
"With Jordan and Maxwell in the same team, KXIP's fielding looks strong",5
Oh okay sarfraz has lost some weight,3
got hyped up before the season as everybody were saying Delhi's got the right mix of experience and yOuNg gUnS.,3
HOLY FUCKING GOD,1
Bad ball,1
Smashed!!,1
Iyer isnthr youngest daddy in the ipl,2
Yes 😍,1
"What a hit, Iyer!",4
Playing fantasy league fucks you up . You want both the bowler and the batsman to do well at the same time .,9
Smoked it,2
Now its getting interesting,2
shreyas + pant is an underrated duo,12
"The last time I followed IPL was in 2009. I remember thinking back then, this is shit level cricket. While that's not true for all matches, it's true for certain teams.

11 years later, started watching IPL mostly as a result of pandemic/lockdown. I have to say this match has made me wary of watching certain teams play.",3
Just tuned in and first thing I noticed was DC in the scoreboard and was like when the fuck did Deccan Chargers come back 🥴,5
Ohh my that was an orgasmic hit.,6
Chad Iyer is love man,3
"That has to be 100+ , rite?",3
What a shot Iuer,2
That was a monster hit!,2
Iyer is monster against spinners,7
Fuck that's a BIGGIE,3
"Iyer is one handsome lad, no homo",8
Gaganchummi,5
Im glad there's no fake crowd noise now.,3
Fuck me in the arse you sexy mallu,11
A C C E L E R A T I O N,5
Yeah. That ball is not coming down,12
"Shreyas ""Fine, I'll do it myself"" Iyer",5
Iyer Big Sixer King has entered the chat.,8
Raina and pant look so awkward hitting sixes. Their bats always touch their bums.,19
How is playing a sweep shot innovative? KP with his hair brained commentary again.,6
99m is long eeeh,10
I CAN'T ESCAPE KP COMMENTARY!!!,11
"Massive is an understatement! Thug life, didn't even bother to look at it after.",9
Go Idly,11
That is probably the most difficult shot against spin.,9
You can't keep these boys quiet for a long time :),5
Now that's the shreyas I know. Fucking kill this part timer.,3
homie’s dripping with sweat damn,12
Gazab bezati hai.,9
Iyer loves just standing in the crease and smashing the spinners.,11
"Wait, if Rishab coughs as much as he usually does, will he be forced to self-isolate?",18
Haven't been reading the comments but has anyone noticed the crowd noise is a bit mellow today? It's almost as if the AI figured what's appropriate for a KXIP match.,49
This track is conducive for pace bowling and the variable bounce is only going to exacerbate in the second innings. It would be a tough chase for us if Delhi manage to score around 160.,7
Gowtham has already given away more runs than he can score.,7
wtf is a unacademy six?,10
"Bowler was like ""Ca....""",3
[deleted],4
Gowtham losing his ball,3
Man this was a class shot!,3
Give that bowl to me if not needed,13
No look six,4
[deleted],33
That one could have escaped most stadiums,10
Here comes the ugly Pant hoick everyone hates so much,8
Two beauties,9
Iyer has such a pleasing golf-like swing. Pant seems to use much more of his body,25
[removed],5
Iyer hit it clean against spinners,4
Lol. Reminds me of tape ball cricket where we have to change the ball every 3-4 overs to retape,13
KG is reserved for Rabada not Gowtham. Wtf Cricbuzz!,13
Good over. Don't try anything now. Just single.,5
Iyer can cunt spinners out of the park like no other cricketer in the world.,5
Best bouncer in world cricket? Bruh get off his dick,9
Shreyas *damage control* Iyer,5
Bari toh Nahi kahuga pr huge thi,10
fuck me with that timeout shit,10
Finally a good fucking over,3
Are they gonna get a new ball everytime it's smashed into the top tiers?,10
"Look for the ball like its village cricket.


Wtf is this everytime new ball.",9
Unacademy six reminded me of bsnl chowka on radio lol,15
Mandatory wicket after time out commentary coming up,5
I'm impressed by the director's ability to adjust the crowd noise to the typical crowd attendance in a team's stadium.,6
Kings XI Karnataka,11
"A bit unrelated, but I'm impressed with Sarfaraz working on his fitness. Hope he continues his Ranji form when batting.",4
How do you call the statbot?,6
iyers six looks straight out of ea cricket.,8
41 followed by 61 we all know what sunny g will be doing in this strategic timeout,3
Woahhh that Dhoni/CSK fan gets an entire section of the stands for his picture! That's pretty cool for him.,9
"They should place ball boys, two for each stand to fetch balls. 

Changing balls frequently because they can't get sixes from stands will change momentum of the game. 

All the dew and scratches are gone and now bowler has a fresh one. 

What do you guys think?!",13
"Why will Dhoni teaching a kid cricket, make me buy a phone? Wtf are these ads lmaoo",12
"Why isn't Maxi skipper? He seems a very good one in BBL, he also was captain in 2017, anyone know why he lost it?",8
Wow why the hate on gowtham?,10
"Fake crowd noise seems calmer today, making it way more enjoyable to watch.",25
The strategic ad brake is my least favourite thing about the IPL,11
The dugout broadcast is so shit this year,1
Whenever the other batsman hits a boundary I'm scared Pant will try to do the same and get out lol,9
"This ""strategic timeout"" never stops being cringey",11
Dugout is so fun to watch,4
Is it too much to ask both of them to bat till the last over?,6
Shreyas for number 4? lmao,6
"Rabada > whatever fast bowler.


https://youtu.be/ftfq_LM-u8o for the non believers.",12
"Dubai stadium looks nice with the banners, colours and Ads in the stands.

Why didn't they do this in Abu Dhabi too? Even on the grass banks would be cool.",7
bring in Bishnoi already,5
At least the toned down the fake crowd sound. Yesterday was just stupid.,4
United nations academy has declared that the best 6 in UAE,6
"Teacher announcing my chemistry results:

**That's an unacademy 6**",5
Sanjay is sucking the life outta Dugout. Cricket can't escape the wrath of the Sanjay(s).,2
"Pant is built like Gurkhas and other Mountain area people. Small physique but good strength, he might be from there !!?",1
I'm just glad they've toned down the crowd noise a bit.,3
Support delhi = Have your heart in your mouth everytime,1
"Not being a -ve nancy for KXIP fans, but if DC gets to 160, it's gonna be DC's game to lose, IMO.",1
Yay go ravi,2
Enter Bishnoi,2
Ravi Bishnoi looks like an Afghan spinner tf,1
Acko's finding the logo in the match is a pretty ingenious advertising strategy.,1
"Only good thing about playing in UAE is, there is no shitty paan masala Advt in the stadium.",6
RR slowly picking up. Must be making KL nervous.,-1
Is a Iyer 100 out of reach here,3
"Asked this when Pant walked in and so far we have seen a mixture of the two, so let me ask again-

Saw an article today posted here that chastisised India for expecting Pant to play sensibly when he is the first quintessential Indian T20 batsman.

Want to know what Delhi is hoping for? The sensible play or the quintessential Pant.",2
Sorry but who tf is Bishnoi,7
Anil Kumble looks like a proper boss with that beard.,7
Innovative dot,3
20 more of those,7
My man jumped like a fucking video game character lmaooo,5
"I had no idea who Bishnoi until his run-up. It's ofcourse our adorable spinner from the legendary u19 wc, isn't he?",2
This is baptism by fire for Bishnoi. Bowling first over to madlad Pant.,8
Wasn't that wide?,1
"Is there a decent Delhi team in any sport?

I remember Delhi Waveriders winning Hockey India League. Is that league dead now?",1
Bishnoi low key looks like a white guy,6
bishnoi was so good in WC,2
"Why on earth is Strategic timeout not sponsored by KitKat? Atleast makes sense with their ads.


*KitKat Break banta hai*",17
Dis guy has a lot of entropy lol,3
that action seems to be derived from rashid’s,6
Shit show commentary,3
Amit Mishra should start in the next match,2
Bishnoi has a longer run up that Jofra,6
Ravichandran bishnoi,5
"Ravi Bishnoi, the guy who outspun pant",4
Not sure how good a batting coach Sanjay Bangar was (India's woes at the WC19 were surely batting related) but he sure is a shit Dugout analyst/presenter. Wants to get off camera ASAP,2
"Pant, take it easy, and just watch iyer cunt him.",1
Who is this guy?,1
Stoinis is a worse Dhoni at 6. He takes the game deep and always fails.,5
Bishnoi & Bumrah probably start from the same distance in terms of runups,21
Memories trickling back from the heated Ind-BD wc u19 Final. Bishnoi isn't one to be fooled around with.,7
his action looks like Tahirs,2
Kid is good..,8
Bishnoi is the new Kumble,3
Ipl test?,3
MF got a run-up longer than Praveen Kumar,14
Looks like bishnoi has same run up as bumrah.,7
Kumble looking like your stock 90s South Indian movie hero.,13
Good to see Anil Kumble as a coach and not in the comms.,6
Bishnoi is the spinner for U-19 Indian team which made Delhi feel so proud with their abusing.,7
Too good from bishnoi,4
Kumble has been growing that beard ever since he was dropped by Koach,9
Need atleast 110 in the last 10.,3
Did they double down on horn noise effects to stimulate Delhi crowd)?,4
Why Pant is batting like Dhoni :(,-7
Kumble only cares about the games against RCB,11
Bishnoi needs to imagine he's playing against Bangladesh U-19,30
That cut to Kumble was perfect,7
So he just has a long run up but puts no spin on the ball.,3
this kid has a future.,7
We beat 48 bois,13
Bishnoi has a longer run up than Bob Willis,6
Nice. Good over from the guy I don’t know shit about.,7
Bishnoi has longer runup than Air India 🛫,24
Delhi KP Tales,1
Jaddu would finish 3 balls by the time this guys completes his runup,7
Pretty good over for debutant.,8
I like these dream11 ads but maybe repeat them a bit less..,1
Yuvi and DADA are the most stylish left hand indian batsmen.,3
What the fuck is this my God 😂😂😂😂,1
Gather needs to keep the pressure on.,1
Ah these shitty cringe dream 11 fans,6
"If 2020 had an ipl winner

<insert DC or RCB Logo>",1
He looks cute ngl,1
My first memory of bishnoi was when he was abusing Bangladeshi batsmen left right and centre.,3
Fuck this shit. Just want THE HUNDRED ^^TM,0
Hope Bishnoi turns out to be good. We can play Jordan/ Cottrell then instead of Mujeeb.,3
STOP WITH THIS CRINGEY HOME FANS SHIT FFS,6
More like Dream11 tiktok dancers,3
"I would pay not to be featured on those Fan Cams. Goddamn, Cringe.",6
Dream 11 fans are CEO's of cringe,7
Those moves from the champion fans look very cheesy,2
Maxwell,2
Punjab lack a good porven spinner. They are trusting gowtham as one but he should be a second spinner in a team.,1
Wow is this virtual presence everywhere a real thing now?,2
Ravi Bishnoi is like when you want to be like Warne but secretly love Shoaib Akhtar.,1
That champions box is creepy as fuck. Stop doing that.,3
So do y’all dance when someone hits a 6 or smt like those dream11 fans,2
they only picks the dorks for the dream 11 fans,3
Is stoinis any good?,2
That chak chak express has been replaced by dream11 champion fans. Fml,5
"IPL be like: if we can't give you the cringefest that Tasty Treat Cuck Cuck was, we'll give Dream11 fans cringefest! Cope motherfuckers!",3
Wow they looking to attack Krishna here,2
F for tasty treat army,4
Binny boiiii!! 😍,1
The outfield is bad. Real bad.,2
Tf is Dream 11 champion fans we don't want to have them on our screens and see their dances,13
Still haven't quite got over the KFC bloke randomly at the toss during the Eng SA t20s at the beginning of the year,8
Every team has a krunal pandya.,1
Bring on fast bowlers,1
"Man whenever a T20 score is x(y), y > x, it makes me so anxious lol.",3
Gimme eight strategic timeouts over that Dream11-tiktok-fans bs,5
Iyer is completing the second while Pant is still halfway. Captain has a bright future.,6
We need a cringe threshold.,1
"Question Delhi management's choices, but Iyer has always been their best investment",4
Who here supports Kings 12 Punjab -- ? Tell the truth,4
"Deano is bang on.

Should have kept the Quicks going.",3
Only thing sexier than batting without a helmet is batting in a wide brim hat,3
Damn KL was like lightning with that glove work. Pant's India career is in biiig danger.,2
How good is stoinis? Quick,1
Wonder if we'll see someone wear their groin guard as a mask lmao,1
That was really quick wrists from sexy boi,1
Pant has been looking like he wants to launch evry other ball into orbit.. but then you look at his strike rate and it's just 100,2
Iyer > Pant. Don't @ me.  ^(/s),3
The outfield is horrible. I'm really worried that someone's gonna blow their knee out. Gowtham almost did.,2
Bruh this batting is painful to watch.,4
This feels like EA cricket. Suddenly Benaud will start commentating,3
Mayank Aggarwal has lost weight. Looks fit af.,5
This game is already over,-1
Gowtham is literally Krunal Pandya but Right handed and worse,1
Will there be anyone from here on dream 11 champions fan... Lol,1
DC need atleast 140 to have a chance .,2
Lmao Pant will consider giving his wicket than running 2 quick runs.,6
Only three boundaries so far. Kinda amazing.,7
No one here followed U19 WC it seems. Bishnoi abusing tf outta Bangladeshis was a great sight.,7
The lack of Chris Gayle today is a crime.,5
"Delhi probably gonna bat sensibly till about 30 overs, and keep wickets in hand for the final 10",8
looks like 140 would be a good score.,1
Bishnoi looks like Sam Rockwell,4
Something more interesting: shaheen Afridi just took 4 in 4 to finish with 6/19 against Middlesex,8
"Batting without any headgear on should be illegal

Come on fellas you have the chance to bat in a floppy and you don't do it?",5
I wonder what DC's total will be!,3
Bro this Spresso is the shittiest car to hit the streets in a long long time,3
"They gonna smash Shami, Jordan and Cottrell in the death? Fuck no",5
Is Gayle playing?,2
Lol,2
I hope jald hi Pant Gilly go jai,4
Poor fielding from Ravi Ashwin,3
Lmao Pant doing Pant things. Swinging blindly,7
This is the only issue with the T20 format - it's near impossible to win if you lose 3 wickets in the first powerplay,1
"Kings XI them be like   


""It starts with one thing i don't know why. Doesn't even matter how hard you try""",1
Can someone ask the ambience DJ to cool it please? They are making it unbearable.,2
"Dirty runs, but useful runs.",2
What is the use of dream 11 advertising if it is taken off the Google play store,2
Foakes would have taken this. Oh wait....,4
That was unlucky for Bish,3

"Rishabh Pant or as Michael Vaughan loves to call him, Rishba pant.",2
Who is that cute jogger that chased the ball,1
Need more of ose bois,2
These innovative dots are getting better,10
Pant with that full bodied slog,1
This boy is goooood,3
Rishabh at his again,1
Stop these fan reactions man..We don't wanna see it,2
LMAO Bishnoi making pant look like an amateur,3
"It's been so long, Bishnoi was the one who almost single-handedly won us that U19 final right?",2
R. Shirt has matured a lot,3
Someone end Pant’s misery.,9
damn bishnoi is three months younger than me,5
Bishnoi can come in Indian squad. We need more of them,5
That was an innovative boundary from Pant,2
They've got a settled partnership going and it's about time these two up the tempo in the next two overs.,2
Pant ke liye toh batting baaye haath ka khel hai,5
140-150 my prediction,3
Pant panicking. Trying to hit every ball hard. Would not last long this way.,5
No offence but it looks like a monkey is bowling leg spin. He's been effective tho.,-8
[removed],6
Anything outside the off stump and Pant has been restricted,3
Pant needs to play a long innings if DC wants to put a respectable score on board. But my guy looks like he wants to finish the game early.,6
Why the F**k they dont go for 2,2
Bishnoi resembles Afridi because he is 19,6
Rishabh is good to punjab... He converted so many 2s into 1s,8
There's no second with Pants on. Iyer shouldn't expect Pant to run like Kohli or Dhoni.,4
"no leg break, no top spin",4
KP still talking about himself,6
Dean Jones + Scott Styris + Graeme Swann = Peak Dugout,5
What I wouldn't give to see Pak players back in the IPL,6
Isn't there any other Indian Seamer in KXIP squad so Mujeeb could play,2
Pant come on don’t be lazy,2
[deleted],-3
bishnoi compressing the opposition like a zip file.,6
Iyer's fade looks pretty new. How did he get an haircut in the midst of the bio bubble?,4
who was Punjab's leg spinner last season,2
Commentators are having orgasm just watching pant,3
"""Stoinis is an alrounder so he bats 6""

fucking hell I hope they bump him up the order next match",13
"I hope Bishnoi gets in the t20 team 
 
Chahal's unwillingness to bowl googlies sometimes irtitates me",-4
I just feel bad for iyer he is such a talent....deserves a better team,3
Is it true that it's illegal to take 2 runs in Delhi?,7
"Bishnoi looks like a fine spinner. Gotta see how he bowls after getting tonked for a six or two.

Great investment for KXIP for sure",4
Pant gets into the most weirdest positions trying to hoick shit. It is stuff like that which makes him look so fidgety and unbalanced in the middle which is why his dismissals look ugly sometimes.,7
Bishnoi was born in 2000...so young... gosh,7
Pant should be giving out for playing shitty shots just like that ad.,3
Kumble prepped his weapon (Bishnoi) against his target (Kohli). All set and loaded I can see.,11
Why exactly isn't mujeeb playing today?,3
Damn they're playing like they play for india,7
Sarfaraz aaj dhoka naa de bas,6
I would love a super over of bishnoi against pant this ipl.,9
"- be me
- be excited about a cricket event
- participate in a game of fantasy cricket
- be anxious the whole match and get disappointed when a player not in my team performs
- not able to enjoy the match
- suddenly realise why I uninstalled the app last time",7
This Bishnoi kid looks nervous af. He's bowling nicely though.,2
Only here to watch the Stoinis 8 off 13 master class,9
Was it Shaw's or dhawan's fault for the run out?,2
Dhoni academy boys,2
S L A A T A R,1
First match of IPL and Pant is already exhausted,2
Gowtham stats doesn't look bad but he hasn't been lethal Mujeeb needs to play,2
Mr platter how do you do.,2
2 sixes in this over,5
"Bishnoi , one heck of a prospect for India.. Was really impressed watching the youngster bowl in U19..",4
Test match going on,1
Sarfaraz looks even more thicc than before,1
good bants from Sunny tbf,2
Ever since the timeout the shit fake crowd is back. Foxtel gave me hope to take it away,6
Why aren't they going over gowtham,1
should bhajji have called symmo a monkey in 2008?,1

Pure class,2
How is Shreyas Iyer in perfect equilibrium always?,3
Currrrraking shot,1
"Fuck Iyer is a monster against spinners 
 
doesn't even need to step out",3
Iyer is argubaly the best stand and deliver six hitter.,3
CRRRRRAAAACK,1
What is Unacademy,5
What's this cracking six nonsense?!,2
Instead of Gowtham make Maxwell bowl a over,5
Both the batsman are good against spin so they should be attacking rn while the spinners are still up.,3
it looked premeditated,2
This is so gully cricket. 😂Have to wait for the ball everytime someone hits a six.,8
"Did they stop showing how many metres the six travelled?

Edit: I am blind",5
Again,1
Stop tossing it up ffs,3
Iyer baby don't stop,5
"You go iyer, what a player man",8
Bradman against Spin,4
"Having Rahul keep, open and captain is exciting to watch, but Punjab are essentially shortening his India career with this workload. Probably good to have Pooran take over keeping duties if his batting form is alright.",5
Iyer should be the 4th player for Indian teams ODI. Put him their and give him time ill the end of the next world cup.,3
shreyas bhai GONNA MAKE ME BUST,5
Iyer looks like he wants to be the captain that steers the way all the way to home,7
absolutely cunting it rn,8
B E H E N C H O D,2
"*Delhi hits 6 runs*
People wearing KXIP jersey on Fam cams lose their mind.",8
They got another reason to show ads,4
Some seriously clean hitting here,13
These two are the core,2
Why Iyer hates Gowtham so much ?,10
Iyer against spin is God.,6
That's how you do it Pant .,1
Ez,1
Another unacademy cracking six!,4
Iyer is the only boii who plays offspinners the way they need to be. Older gen fans approve!,6
Good recovery,3
I love Shreyas calm and composed demeanor even more than his talent. Complete package for me.,6
Talk nah /r/Cricket,9
Iyer now toying with Gowtham like a net bowler,1
This is how a number 4 should play.,1
Iyer doesn't even look at the shot after he plays it. Chad.,3
Number 4 and future captain of India right here bois,2
These sixes would be two tier in india,2
"Ah I love this guy, I miss the crowd roaring and this one was a screamer",4
Iyer is such a good find! I wish he was in the team during the WC at 4.,1
Range hitting from Iyer!,3
">Iyer on crease

Spinners: Why do we hear boss music?",5
These 2 shots looked like blind swing,1
"""Unacademy cracking six"" Cringe!!",20
another cRRRRRRacking stRRRRRooke,5
First time Bat(s)man is doing damage to Go(w)tham,4
"Gowtham needs to use across the angle against Shreyas and try to square him up.. Regardless of how wide bowls it's meant to come into him in the slot..

Unless you can flight and bowl flat like Ashwin one shouldn't try that length against Shreyas..",3
Holyfuck! Never have I missed a sponsor as much as YesBank. Pls It is painful to hear Unacademy Six.,9
black screen on hotstar ?,1
"In middle of the match.

Net sessions have started.",3
Bro Jay Shah looks kinda Sus.,3
Iyer would have won us the semi final last year,8
Sehwag be like - That's my boi,1
"I really hope Delhi win the ipl man, these two can make it happen",1
bring in someone that can bowl short to Iyer,2
Finally run rate more than 6,2
Can't wait for Shreyas to be a consistent part of the playing XI for India. He's ready.,5
The amount of funding Unacademy has got is absolutely mind-boggling.,3
Anyone here feel pant is little overrated ?,6
"Two sixes & a single.

Sunny G just fapped himself to death.",76
iyer in ipl >>>> iyer in gpl.,6
"From the point of view of Indian cricket this is a very good test for Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant. Both normally free stroking players, but today have to be more measured and be in when the 15th over begins",3
DLF maximum >> Unacademy cracking six,19
"I don't like Bishnoi being exposed this early to the world before he actually makes an India Debut.

Spinners usually have a terrific 12 to 18 months when they are new and unknown to the rest of the world. Now if he is a regular in IPL he will be studied by opposition by the time he makes his India Debut. 

He will still be good initially but the surprise element will not quite be there for opposition.",9
Bro wtf how did they not run 2 for dat,2
Is it just me or the outfield is really slow?,3
"Ooooh 2 sizes, maybe a turn in the batting?",2
You bowl spin to choke? Hmmmm,2
bring on Ashwin vs Iyer the battle of the Brahmins,-7
Yes pls,1
Just switched from Dugout to normal commentary. Ngl I'm enjoying a lot more with the noise.,3
"Gowtham comes to bowl, Iyer: "" It's free real estate """,7
Rishabh doesn't look as pleasing as Iyer against spin,4
Off the topic but fuck Videocon d2h. Trying to add Star sports hd unsuccessfully for half an hour.,2
does anyone here listen to L Fresh The Lion?,2
For iyers second six before ball lands someone from DUGOUT said it's 82 meters... How they know that,3
"Bishnoi has been impressive 

KXIP has a team balance issue with only 5 bowlers and maybe Maxwell",3
What's the hair style of Iyer ?!,3
Holy shit the delayed reactions are back,6
"Shreyas , keep it cool man",7
irrespective of the final score this was a damn well rescue act for the duration it happened.,4
"The more I see him the more I believe that Pant doesn't care whether his head falls over. That's ungainly, and an eyesore. But as long he scores, I'm going to root for him.",11
Pant don’t want to run,4
"

Ugly but effective ™",3
Bang bang time baby !,1
Finally Pant waits for it,2
Bold,2

"That frustrated ""maderchod"" from pant was ill",3
"ffs Pant shouldn't've made you vc

Decent innings for pant. Credit where it’s due,2
Bad time to lose a wicket. Stoinis is super slow.,1
I was about to say that pant is proving me wrong but damn I was saying too soon.,3
Need to bring back Shami rn,4
Yaas Ravi,1
Well bowled Bisho,3
Pant's been having a bit of the ol' Biryani huh?,4
Gazab bezati hai.,3
Did someone notice pant saying : B H E N C H O D,8
"So in the IPL are the commentators required to say INSERT AD HERE, wonderful 6, lovely ball etc? ... Fucking hell.",7
Pant spittin Ben stokes,3
"Hopefully, first of many, many wickets for Bihsnoi.",1
Easy on pant guys he was alright atleo,2
Get big boi Stoinis now,-1
This kid has the x-factor looks like,2
Tu bhenchod,2
Pant status: DOWN,6
First bhenchod of this IPL?,12
You can't just hit continuously off Bishnoi,4
Well deserved. Bishnoi had Pant's number. Looked very uncomfortable.,4
Pant should keep himself for the Pacers! Shreyas should be allowed to go after spinners and Pant after pacers. Haven't seen them doing the opposite well historically.,0
Pant made 31 runs. Cut him some slack. Game 1 + He came in at 13/3.,14
Pant needs to grow up man. Enough of “he is just a kid”. Seen this shit too many times.,6
The difference in shots of iyer and pant....shows the age and maturity,6
"Pant was just slogging. Nothing much.

Overrated player !!!",2

Yo where is mujiBUR?,-1
YAS BOI,0
"Pant always has that ""I JUST STARTED THE APOCALYPSE"" face on after dismissal",3
Pants off,2
Why didn’t Delhi play lamichanne?,3
Kings xi really have a weak domestic spin bowling line up. Never ever heard of these guys,1
"The hate boner for pant is insane. 
Thats a good innings keeping the situation in mind.",13
"Beauty from Bishnoi.. One thing I am seeing which he would improve with experience is use of the height for more flight..He is leaning in too much which is reducing the release height..

But already impressed with the control..",2
Good innings nonetheless,2
hahahaahahahahahahahaa,2
Aggressive Captaincy.,2
"Does height relate to one's fitness level? I see many indian players who are kind of no so fit are not very tall. Parthiv, Pant, Sarfaraz, Shaw??",1
Pant was not looking good today .,1
"""Pant has been removed"" - SunnyG",5
The Hulk is here,2
"“Sleepy” Stoinis is going to play lot of dot balls

One of the most overrated players",1
"Ngl, having Kumble as our supposed leader makes me feel a lot more stable than Ashwin for some reason. Not a dig at Ashwin. He gave it is his all and I respect him for that",2
I just heard Warne cum,2
Lmao KL no bullshiting can convince the umpire that’s not a wide,1
I always wonder how pant managed to national side with his skills of lappa,2
It would be funny if Stoinis tries to have a relationship like he has with Zampa with Ashwin,3
We needed mishi boy competing with bishi boy. Unfortunately mishi boy is not playing today.,2
Commentator curse,1
"Pant gets out after scoring 31, rebuilding nicely after a early batting collapse. WhAt A ShIt PlAyEr!!",11
Why does Pant has to try slogging when Iyer is smacking it? Just rotate the strike ffs,2
"H U L K

Stoinis at 6 is a crime,5
"Stoinis has 6 overs left to score his fifty, let’s go",4
70 more in six overs pls. 🤞,5
"Lol did KP just say Stoinis has performed up the order for Australia? Yeh, that's never happened",3
ITS PUNJAB SZN,2
This Bishnoi guy looks very impressive,3
"Bad temperament from Pant, had just hit a boundary and 7 off the over and tried to hit it out the ground again. He should listen more to seniors like Parthiv on how to bat intelligently",-2
My my my,1
2 in 2. We're fucked guys.,3
`C O L L A P S E - 2`,7
Shami too OP,3
"The more I look at Pant, he looks like having that one shot",0
They're both alright but they don't scream international India batsman quality at all. Surely this isn't the future for India,-4
One brings two,1
People are definitely more critical of Pant than any other player.,6
It's ok.. first match can be shit..,4
Shami you beauty,3
"Damn Iyer, It wasn't the over :(",1
bruh,1
Ffs u just lost a wicket can't y all wait ?,1
Don't bet against Shami today!,2
All according to Goat Ashwins Plan to come and have his way with Kxip bowlers for 6 overs,5
Shami is on 🔥 today 💪,3
Shami is top tier lawd jyesus,2
SHAMI IS A GOD,1
Heavens no,1
It’s going down,1
Collapse,1
Excellent bowling change,3
Being a DC supporter is pain,2
Pace back Iyer back to dressing room,2
"The shot that pant just played, we used to call it a harbhajan slog in school cricket. Eyes closed, full swing of the bat. Most of the time, we missed the ball completely. Great to see the shot being played in int'l stage",9
Bruh,1
Shami you fuckin' beauty,9
What the fuck,4
Shami comes in and takes a wicket like it is a walk in the park,9
Game over.,3
Fucking shit I love Shami,2
Delhi behenchoood hahahah,2
And thats how you destroy a fanbase,15
"I don't speak Hindi, but I'm pretty sure Pant let out a pretty strong benchode (spelling?) as he walked off.",21
KL could've just stuck with the pace. Ashwin would've.,2
"Shami - Baap baap hein, beta beta hain to Iyer ...",3
Y U Do dis Shreyas ? 2nd match with shit 1st innings.,2
Shami can do no wrong.,5
DC bby what is you doin,2
Hahahaha,1
Mc lo tum log. Main nahi dekh raha.,1

Wooohooo,1
Anyone else think Stoinis is in good physical shape? I've never heard anyone mention his bulging biceps or his herculean pectorals,8
Shami hero da.,5
"Ah, at least Shami is back to form",5
Good aggressive captaincy here.,4
Shami hero aada hero,10
Oof shami having a match of the year,5
There was no need to play that aerial against a red hot bowler,3
Time for best batman Ashwin,2
Any more action In that bowling and he might fly away,1
People here just want every player to play bad ffs.,4
We are seeing 2nd inning test shami here today,7
Why do i even support DC. Fucking can't even find a reason.,6
150 suddenly seems legendary.,4
People critique pant cause he has huge shoes to fill,2
"Roses are Red,

Violets are Blue,

Oh! A Delhi collapse,

Nothing new.",14
"Dear KP, not everyone can pull off a KP against Steyn. -- Sincerely, India fans.",3

Axar Patel 100 today or else I'll eat my underwear,6
yeah DC is a last place team,3
"That's the game, Shami is an incredible bowler. Him and Chris Jordan have a lot in common",4
final score just dropped by 30 runs in 2 legal balls,5
Shami is too OP at the moment. Divorce did wonders to his career.,8
I miss watching harbhajan bat in tests. The guy could slog,3
DC offer today - Buy 1 Get 1 free.,10
The fuck is Axar doing so up the order?,2
First Innings Shami strikes!!,1
[deleted],1
Aaaand... we are back to unabated fuckery from DC,2
"KP giving benefit of doubt to Iyer.

He picked the slower ball well, but didn’t execute the shot properly",1
Kinda understand why PSL games are so low scoring,2
Second innings Shami arrived early.,2
mAtuRiTy,1
This is what’s so infuriating about Iyer... otherwise he should have been regular for India XI already,1
Kings XI legend Axar Patel,3
Stoinis is overrated. Mitchell Marsh is better,1
"No chance for DC now unless there is a Stoinis special. But looking at his performance in England, that is unlikely",1
Axar looks like a rabbit.,3
"I keep telling this sub that Pant is way too overhyped, I keep getting downvoted...

Shami is amazing,2
"Best team on paper, suffering from west indies school of batting",8
Shoot those yorkers,0
DC's top 5 looks pretty stacked. But I think finishing is always their weakness. Need to have both Stoinis and Carey at 6 and 7. Axar at 7 is not that inspiring.,2
FUCK MY LIFE,0
Any young bowling talent for India in this IPL ? like Bumrah ?,0
What lol,-1
[Shaheen Afridi just took 4 wickets in 4 balls. All bowled. ](https://twitter.com/hantscricket/status/1307695454629629953?s=21),-7

"Maxi's like a cocaine addict in the covers, bloke never stops moving.",5
Shami is gonna be so good in the tests against England here,3
"My dream  11 doesn’t feel so rn , gayles not playing",4
Should'nt over the head be a wide?,1
Axar looks like he has a fake nose on,2
What they should do is let MI and DC merge and let them have 22 batsmen to bat and and 22 fielders. Then they might win some games,5
Iyer's beast mode vs spin neutralized by bringing in Shami early for his 4th over. Brilliant from KL Rahul.,12
[deleted],-10
Aswin on suicide watch for switching teams.,3
Good captaincy from kl Rahul. Good strategy for finishing spinners before getting the quicks on to finish the over while the batsman aren’t as aggressive,3
Shami now in full chad mode,3
Delhi looks so weak In batting once Iyer and Pant leaves.,3
"I want commentators to ask rahul about his brilliant decision move of bringing shami in the 15 over.

And social media to go crazy that if rahul did something there was reason behind it.",7
How is that wide?,2
In current form Shami is probably the best Indian fast bowler at the moment,8
What is he even complaining about lol doesn't he know you're only allowed one per over,2
Leg umpire seems to like his butter chicken,2
I wouldnt bowl axar at all if were SI,1
Very dhoni like innings from pant,-1
Do these people  not realise that they can also hit fours and not only sixes. A lot less risky too,3
"Axar also like Ashwin played for Kings XI

so Bishnoi will end up in Delhi too",4
DC was in almost everyone's Top 4 predictions but no one saw their lower middle order trouble not saying they are not qualifying,3
"Never saw the appeal in Axar Patel. He's like 3rd class copy of Yuvi, but that's it",7
How on Earth was Shami allowed to change sides?,3
Loving these big boundaries!,1
I like the awkward 2 second silence between the guy catching the ball and the abrupt crowd cheering noises.,5
Not cricket related but this thread has a lot to do with it..Reached 1k comment karma today..,6
"Me : Tunes into the match after DC hit 2 sixes .

DC : Loses 2 crucial wickets immediately.",11
Wow wtf  Kxip bought a balanced team for once? this year they have Hyderabad level bowling attack and Rcb level batting power.,4

KL Rahul vs Iyer - future audition for Indian captain,6
"Shamis bald spot has increased, is he back with his wife or something?",8
Idk why Axar Patel reminds me of dungeon_master from tvf pitchers,7
Bowlers are nervous to bowl to Stoinis. His big pecs are too intimidating.,10
"Hey Shami, don't overdo the Knuckle balls now. You might develope an addiction like Boobie.",33
Fucking stellar bowling from Shami,7
Has Rahul had captaincy experience? Like what he's done thus far.,10
Should have been ashwin at 3 instead of hetmyer,8
Always keep getting vindicated when I say experience > YoUnG TaLeNt,2
Is a bowler allowed to switch sides for a free hit? That no ball was bowled from over the wicket and the free hit was bowled around the wicket.,2
Am I the only one who thinks Sunny G always gets worked up over bouncers?,6
how was that a no ball?????????,3
Lmao big unit,5
Delhi just like Rajshtan for couple of season is now very top order heavy.,3

KL has done a great job behind the stumps and captaining the team so far. Him and Iyer both can turn out to be great options for the captain of India after Kohli,4
does anyone know the song in that diamond ad with Ana de armas on hotstar stream,3
"I'm glad Strategic Breaks exists for the team but if I was working in a TV corporate, I'd use it as an advantage to stuff more ads",3
Who's the cunt walking alongside Ponting?,3
What's up with that accent of Sherays Iyer in that Mutual Funds Sahi Hai commercial. Anyone else found it cringy.,3
Supporting Delhi is like buying a lottery ticket.,5
Wtf KXIP doing well?,3
You know the batting shit the bed when theres a newbie spinner bowling the death,1
Can we start some momentum to Retire SunnyG from commentary like we did with SanjuManju?,2
When was the last time you saw Axar with a notable batting or bowling performance!?,3
You love it when everybody is talking shit about Rahane at the beginning and once DC collapse its 'We need Rahane for solidity',7
Stoinis gonna get out in this over,3
I'm loving this new guy Bishndi! Bowl like this and you'll be giving Chahal a run for his money in the international team.,5
"When you have a slip in 16th over for a spinner, you know the state of this match",7
So far great use of Bishnoi by Rahul and great performance by Bishnoi on Debut,10
Inb4 ashwin mankades us to victory,27

Shami's ex wife is going to claim the Unacademy MoM  award,28
Stop👏playing👏Stoinis👏in👏the👏middle 👏order.,3
I've missed just talking and reading comments on match threads with you guys. Please never turn this place into a r/soccer type of shitfest.,20
How are people saying things like Shami is best Indian fast bowler right now? He's done good today but y'all haven't seen the rest since quite some time,6
Pant has been the highest scorer for DC for two consecutive seasons. He played a pretty decent knock under pressure today too. It’s amazing how much hate he gets.,21
[deleted],3
This IPL gonna be low Scoring,4
Young Stoinis plays like old Dhoni.,11
Stoin getting his eye in before a blitz from 19.4 overs,51
Which team is your unusual choice to win the ipl?,-4
Classic outside the off stump bait to Aussies. More Chahal vibes from Ravi.,7
Stoinis is not your finisher and don't think any IPL team will give him chance at opening,6
Delhi can play Rahane at three in place of hetmyre and Lamichhane/Paul in place of Akshar Patel/Mohit Sharma.,1
KLR's captaincy has been spot on till now.. plus some shitshow from DC helping them,8
Stonis be like i am just gonna defend my stumps here.,1
1 more over of tuk tuk before they go?Or 2?,2
"Damn what a debut.

Brilliant from Bishonoi. Looks the part.",4
Shami and Bumrah are both very good. Just enjoy them man,3
Pant was awesome today. Who is hating?,0
Lol Sunny doesn't rate Kumble at all.,3
Stoinis knows if he successfully hits out he's not going to move up the order,2
Wow Delhi is fucked. Didn't they have the strongest team this year?,9
"Dhawan Stoinis, open with this",1
He walked. Rezpekt!!,2
Look at the bicep on this black gentleman,2
Pant would have dropped that,2

Was batting well Had to bat deep but no
Hoicks just after pant got caught",3
[deleted],38
"Axar was like ""Hell no, I don't want to face Cottrell""",4
Stoinis up the order makes more sense. Any of you watched the recent Eng-Aus series?,8
And Ponting tells Axar not to walk again,4
Let's not expect much from Axar,5
Cottrell’s smile is so wholesome.,6

Punjab team with so many windies and Maxwell too. My thanks and greetings to whoever set the lineup this year,6
"Don't prefer KL keeping for Punjab as a long term option, especially when a better keeper in Pooran is available.",5
Ethics time😎,4
What happened to the salute? No crowd no salute?,4
Axar Patel is so shameless he actually thinks he's an all rounder ffs 😭,7
The fuck is he doing at 7 man. Ridiculous. He's totally scared.,3
"Axar Patel is an absolutely nothing player. Have said it for seasons, looks like will keep saying thru this season as well.",6
"Man, that was so dumb of Iyer. Like why? A wicket just fell, and they bring their strike bowler on... what do you think was their plan?",5
This lower order is a nightmare,2
Imagine ashwin gets mankaded,7
Are flairs permanent?,6
"ABSOULUTE VILLAGE.

If village cricket had reviews",3
Didn't he walk? Why'd they review it?,3
"If you want a positive thought Delhi fans

In the first IPL , in their first match Delhi collapsed in a similar vain against RR and we’re thrashed. However they bounced back to finish top of the table.",4
Mujeeb and Bishnoi will wreck teams when the pitches slow down later on in the tournament,8
6(9) Nice,6
Axar patel you useless piece of shit.,8
Ravi Ashwin 999,5
Btw is sanju manju finally gone or he's still around for IPL?,6

These Pant ads for Dream11 are funny though!,2
Ashwin’s coming on?,1
Remember when Axar used to get picked ahead of Jadeja?,8
Ashwin looking fit,6
Ashwin looking slim,4
3 former KXIP players back to back for DC,3
Bruh some massive collapse going on,1
1 Mankand please.,4
Ashwin gonna smack them and guide youngsters how to bat,3
6(9) nice,4
"For the guys thinking that it's poor decision to let KL keep all matches, yes it is, but I think they will rotate the keeping between him & Pooran. He's a gun batter as well.",1

The canned crowd noises are strange,1
"ridicuolous that Axar Patel is No 7.

what are DC management thinking",3
TN Opener walks in at 8.,7
the scenes if theres a mankad today,2
"Outside of Rabada, DC's overseas lineup is pretty bad. They might as well play with more Indians.",5
How long has it been since a boundary,2
Bad bad decision by Iyer,1
For fuck sake atleast score 135+,3
"DD just need to get close to 130 

Opening burst from Rabada can still win them the game",2
"Ashwin,  Stoinis, Mohit Sharma and Axar Patel have all played for Punjab. Sometimes this feels a bit surreal in IPL",3
Ashwin is our cheeky reply to Saul Goodman,5
Feel like shit. Just want to see Ashwin back up.,1
Axar is still cashing in on those few innings of Kxi years ago,3
What’s with the 999 in Ashwin’s shirt?,3
Lol where is Varun Chakrobarty this year? We bought him for 8.5 crs and he played one match. Bishnoi is clear,6
Aight omw to Prithvi Shaw's home,1

Ashwin has practised the run down to third man I can see,3
Simran getting a second chance?,2
Why is mujeeb not playing?,3
"KXIP has a potent attack now with lots of fire power in pace bowlers, A young extremely talented spinner, a steady experienced domestic spinner in Gowtham, a bowler known for his death bowling in Jordan. This is a well rounded attack.

I see Kumble's mark in picking this type of well rounded attack.",9
Alex Carey at the end > Stoinis.,6
Better watch out. Ashwin might Mankad himself,7
"Ashwin should be coming ahead of Patel. 

The latter has been shit for a while.",7
This innings never got going,5
"My god, fuck BCCI and Hotstar. On a 300Mbps connection, I just randomly see black screens for a few seconds. The quality is so fucking shit compared to the England vs Pak series on Willow. ECB, please go to the UAE and teach your magic",6
Stoinis is shit,2
"To everybody thinking Stoinis should've batted at 3, if you think he would've survived Shami for more than 2 balls, I wanna have what you're high on",3
"Ricky Ponting to Ashwin during half time: Hey Ash, come here. We gotta talk.

2 hours later, Ashwin mankads half of KXIP and wins the game for DC 😂.",19
It's amazing how Axar can be a proper allrounder till India A tours and look so shit against international bowlers,3
I think their decision to send Hetmyer at 3 cost them. They should have learnt from his stint at Bangalore,6
why the fuck Ricky Ponting of all people would put stoinis at 6 is fucking beyond me,11
Aswin jersey 999 what does it signify?,2
Axar was good bowler with low economy in first two seasons.... Not he doesn't bat or content runs.... Not a good option in  DC setup,2
"I would like to see a DC minus Shaw, Dhawan and Axar",2
Ashwin wearing the number of Mankads he wants to do this season.,7
"Shaw can fuck off with his cough syrup , axar patel can just fuck off , stoinis can fuck off with zampa , Sparing dhawan, pant and iyer",6
Commentators talking about DC getting 130 and here I am thinking who in their right mind would expect Ashwin and Stoinis to get 10 runs in an over.,4
"Also, I hope some players come out of their *I am a young player* complex",5
How's Rabada and Nortje recent form?,3
Hulk power,7
Hulk smesh !!,3
Hulk smash,2
Is there any stream without the annoying crowd noises?,3
DC have been served a KLPD powered by Shami.,5
Sending Stoinis this low is such a waste,4
Rather watch chelsea vs Liverpool than this dull match.,2
OPEN      WITH       STOIN,8
"Yeah Stoinis hits a six

r/cricket does it again",9
There's his 1 six for the innings,11
**All you had to do was bowl a damn Yorker CJ!**,12
Love me some CJ death bowling. Gets wickets or gets cunted. Always entertaining,7
He is big boy going for big hits... Dugout at its best,6
Stoinis is a big boy alright,3
Man. Jordan was whipped by Stoinis in the Eng-Aus series too,3
"""I'm gonna fuck r/cricket with one shot. Here, hold my Zampa's hand"" - Stoin probably",7

Ethical batting guys... very ethical.,3

i hoped that ashwin would take the mic at the toss and just warned all the teams for the whole of the ipl and just mankads people left and right,4

This is nice from Karnataka XI Punjab,6
Sunny G talking about Political Correctness about the name of the French Cut,5
I swear stoinis always wears a shirt 2x smaller than his size,6
did he just french cut that...nice,3
Ash you gotta go back man,2
Stoinis should be top of the order. Definitely.,1
Hulk Smash,0
After ethical ashwin we now have Politically Correct Gavaskar,5
"There was always two there, Ashwin, you're just unfit mate. Also there's no point in playing Stoinis if he's not at the top of the order.",2
"Anil looks so fit, fitter then Gayle tbh",6
yeah nah Ash ain't running quick 2s,7
"These mankad jokes are getting really old, please stop.",13
Artistic natmeg there from Stoinis ! (SUpoorting DC is such a pain...),7
Ashwin getting mankad is what this match needs now,7
"Fuck man... they should be sending Stoinis up the order. 

It’s such a no-brainer.",3
Just want Ethical Mind to hit some.,7

Ok we get it you used to open Ashwin,6
Ethical shot,3
"Now I can understand why they got Rahane 
 
He can stop the collapse even if he doesn't bat at high SR",5
Ethics what is u doin,1
Didn't recognise kumble with beard . He's looking like a proper football coach ready to fight with refree aka umpiree,9
Slower ball is not the variation anymore the faster one is.,10
Excitedly waiting to see Rabada & Nortje bowl in tandem,8
So umm....do people still use Facebook?,7
"Ashwin doesn't even look like a athelete , why most of indians don't even bother about fitness is beyond me.",5
Ash needs to see the new ball through,3
Nice shot,3
Always rated stoinis,3
I'm beginning to develop an irrational hatred towards those iPhone ads,6
This should be a big 20 run over,5
Stoinis putting us at shame,3
Scenes if Ashwin gets run-out by the bowler,6
OPEN           WITH         STOIN,5
What are you doing on r/cricket if you're not calling cricketers with their made up names?!,7
Goddamn Stoin... I can feel something get hard around my groin.,9
Hulk smash,2
SHOT STOIN. Get in there!!,2
Shane Warne now butt naked on all fours grunting to himself infront of his TV watching Stoinis belting it about.,9
"Offtopic but man gotta say, Hotstar library in India is pretty solid.",7
I said it before. Stoinis would smash us,10
Stoinis is showing that this isn't international cricket ... he isn't so useless at this level.,7
stoinis potentially playing a match-winning knock here,7
Big Stoin shutting them haters up,8
Been waiting like 4yrs for Stoin to do this late in an innings for Australia. Fuck offf,91
"Stoinis batting well

r/cricket in shambles",22
How not to bowl to your field 101,4
"Fuck yeah stoinis, might as well get to 130 if he's at the crease",4
No Stoinis you cannot do that!!,4
*unzip unzip unzip unzip*,5
Viljoen actually was a good death bowler last year iirc.,4
Am I the only one who has had headaches during both these matches because of the incessant noise!,6
Threading the needle. Too good.,5
"Does anyone feel bad for Ashwin? CSK always tried to retain their core but left out Ashwin. They don't even bid for him. Surely, things soured between Dhoni and Ash post their RPS stint.",32
Stoinis bc MI ke jale par namak chidakte hue,3
Player leaves RCB and gets good. The famous curse,11
"Yep CA its all about money, you are definitely not paying Big Mighty Stoin enough",5
Can practically hear Warne blowing his load from here,9
Why did they pick Stoinis over Carey who’s just come from a match winning hundred? Or they could have played him instead of hetmyer bcoz hetmyer is a good player of spin bu they sent him at 3. They seem a bit lost,1
That's a chad leave,2
KXIP has no death bowler at all,1
Yes stoinis inject ur boundaries in my veins,3
Stoinis going at r/cricket like Tiwary & Rohit at Hardik's lunch,14
Great start to the over. Now watch Ashwin play some dot balls.,2
Stoin is so good,2
Stoinis making me eat my words,3
That strike rate of 191 is perhaps Stoins’ all time best?,5
This sub is going to kill itself after this.,7
Goddamn it are we fooked,2
The delayed crowd noise is garbage. Just don't do it at all if its that tacky lol,7

Big brain DC fan wearing the mask under his nose 👏👏,3
Lmaoooo this is karma payback time!,1
Cottrell making a match of this one. Poor bowling and field setting. Smh,3
"Stoinis now just needs 4-5 balls to get in vs 10-15 balls.

He seems to be improving as far as I can tell",2
"The audio mixing is so bad

I can't even hear the comm box",9
KXIP needs Zampa to distract Stoinis.,7
Fucking hell Stoinis never did it for us,11
Well well well How the turntables,1
The crowd noise for boundaries is so jarring how it cuts in and out suddenly,4
Stoinis went from shit to hit real quick there,1
Why is Stonis so low in Delhis batting order ?,2
"I love the simulated crowd noise, atleast I know its going all the way",3
STOIN GOO GOIN,2
The legend of ex rcb players keeps on growing,10
"So Hotstar got back to me and told me it's Willow's problem.

Willow hasn't gotten back to me, no surprise there.

If it isn't fixed tomorrow I'll email Willow telling them I want to cancel my subscription, that usually gets an answer.",3
Big unit,1
Zampa came thrice already,5
"Stoinis was actuallylooking in good form in England, just kept playing daft shots to get out",3
"Shane Warne update: rolling around on his back moaning in ecstasy, jizz flying everywhere",13
"Is Cottrell supposed to be a good death bowler? I mean he had a good WC, but how is his record otherwise",3
"WTF is wrong with ad agencies, putting another pressure on people to get ultra expensive iPhones to be able to have a romantic life.",1
I think thoes two guys waving flag were only remaining fans of DC,3
Lmao the fake crowd noise has been broken this over. Sounds like an early 00s video game with the rapid change between cheering and whistling,12
"Iyer as a captain is pretty weird choice. He doesn’t come across as the smartest bloke on the field. 

Anyways, hopefully he makes some good changes next match. Perhaps move Stoinis up the order. ~~Also I’m soooo surprised he didn’t pick Mujeeb, considering how ridiculously good he was in the CPL last month~~",5
My man stoin 🤩,2
Ash has to manage a boundary,2
Man stoinis is ripped,5
"If Warne is watching this, he must be scrambling for tissues.",8
WHY DOES RCB HAVE TO DROP EVERY GOOD PLAYER. Cries in corner,7
"I want Stoinis to make DC reach 150, so that the guy here earlier can ask out his crush.",11
Stonis is your no. 3 dc.,7
The curse of RCB is lifted for M Stoinis.,11
"Stonis *touches ball*

Ball *ight imma head out*",8
FFS lower the crowd volume,11

Ethical Shot with a Non ethical result.,9
Why did he celebrate now,2
Cottrell's variation is his quicker ball,4
SALUTE,3
Stoinis taking out the frustration of not being able to hang with out Zampa on Cottrell,4
"If Ashwin becomes a coach after retiring, he would slap the shit out of players who try to steal the extra yard",4
stupid celebration,5
Shall done in the end well done comms are high as fuck,1
"Imagine celebrating like that after getting flogged, then getting a bowler out...",13
That was one hell of a celebration,2
[deleted],1
"Toxic commentary: ""Sheldon well done""",5
Dat salute tho,3
Annoying fake crowd noise. Its like brain cannot comprehend the noise without seeing the crowd,5
Dont run a single Stoin whatever the fuck you do off the last ball,2
Unnecessary,1
Axar Patel looked like Viv Richards compared to Ashwin now,4
Nah bro will have to refer that shot selection with ethical committee,0
The salute finally comes out,3
"**18.6** Cottrell to Ashwin, OUT,  **127-7**

R Ashwin c Mohammed Shami b Cottrell 4 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66",3
That was over head height,3
Remember when Shami saluted Cottrell in the world cup? Shit still makes me laugh,9
FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK....,1
Ethical wicket,7
The celebration is a bit over the top. This is the most expensive over of the last 10 overs.,7
Rabada better batsman than Ashwin,3
Manhandled,4
Sheldon's Salute makes me hard,7
People disrespecting Ashwin like that smh as if they don't remember his 425 sr innings 17(4),4
What is this the kapil sharma show?,1
"Aight, next match Hetmyer is lifting his RCB curse",2
damn I hope he doesn't strain his neck like hasan ali while celebrating like this.,2
whats with warne and stoinis love?,1
"So all 4 teams so far have opted not to play their away spinners, trusting their Indian counterparts instead so as to include away players who play other roles where they are needed more.",2
Is Ashwin looking slimmer than last year?,3
"last time someone saluted Ashwin, it was the Buddha",5
IMO good on Ashwin. Stoinis was doing well so no point in farming the strike. Either hit or get out.,6
"Found the crowd noise track.

Stoin is performing great because zampa took all the negativity with him when he joined RCB,3

Glad to see Jordan has retained his lessons from RCB school of bowling.,8

Oooof. RIP hard work done and getting wrecked like this.,3

Stonion Knight is slaying,2
Stonis is big dicking the shit out of death bowlers here.,2

Son of a gun. Preserving the tradition of leaving RCB and becoming a god,2
This is KXI's most IPL season personified in a match. Starts amazingly well and shits on the bed at the end.,5
Everyone thinking about Warnie & Zampa and I am just looking at Ponting's smug smile.,2
150 on the cards lol,1
42(18) fucking hell,3
Not many of you thought we will score 140+ after the start we had.,6
"Somewhere, Shane Warne is jizzing himself",1
This knock has potential to change the course,2
"Noice, this is pretty good total on this pitch. I hope Mohit Sharma doesn't shit the bad. And probably stonis would need to bowl more than 2 over.",5
Warnie has already rubbed a couple put in the last 2 overs. Have some mercy on your lover you nasty big dick man!,0
I can hear zampa's moans from here,1
God Jordan is so hot and cold but so is Hulk.,1
[Australia rn](https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2019/06/13/835815-meme-3.jpg),4
Wtf lol,1
"Rahul bowled all his best bowlers by 14, luls",3
"WTF is this bowling??? All length balls 

Why is Jordan rated so highly?? Stupid bowling",6
Taking r/cricket to the cleaners,8
Stoinis calm the fuxk down man,2
Brutal!!!,1
"Just hat's off man, what a player",1
2020 strikes again.,5
Beautyyy,1
Jordan exposed again,2
I love Stoinis,2
r/Cricket eat your heart out,4
FOUR MORE,2
Not picking Mujeeb was a bad idea,2
Ok wow. Even Stoinis can't believe this now,2
damn is he the same stoinis who was missing shots last time?,3
Shane Warne in danger of dying from dehydration at this rate,10
Maybe Stoinis should bat higher for DC?,1
I thought jordan was good at death,2
Loving this! It's a decent score now. Very defendable for Delhi,5
Jordan on course for a fifty. No.1 bowler my ass,7
Stoinis is the Russell of the dc team.,5
Pathetic bowling every ball until now has been in the slot,2
"Don't know what makes me more erect, them sexy muscles or this sexy batting from Stoinis.",3
"This is a blinder, reminds me of Morris vs Gujrat Lions",2
The crowd is going beserk,4

This is peak strokeplay!,1
Both team suffering from west indies players,1
"Move aside Kejri, Stoinis be our CM",1
"This 1st innings is KXIP performance in matches/tournaments in a nutshell:

Start off amazingly well, so well that it doesn't even make sense. 

Make questionable decisions in the middle phase. 

Shit the bed so bad in the final phase that it doesn't even make sense

11/10 meme team.",2
Why do teams keep picking up Jordan? He’s been playing in the IPL for almost 6-7 years now and I can’t recall a single game where he’s had significant impact.,3
As good as he is batting this has been a horrible over,2
Marcus Stonks,3
"I thought the score wouldn't even go above 140. 

GG Stoinis",2
Better to give chance to Ishan Porel & bring in Mujeeb,1
Either try yorker or a slower ball. What the hell is this shite length bowling?,1
RCB fans in shambles.,1
Stoinis has to get laid tonight.,3
Stoinis made the game watchable,4
This is what happens when English players play IPL,2
"Stand and deliver.


Mockery of the bowling here.",1
Is this for real?!,1
lads what is going on. how is stoinis doing this after the tour of england that he had,1
This is a fucking KNOCK. Looked like DC were gonna struggle to get 120 earlier but now to get near 150!,2
"Bruh I stopped watching at 17 overs.
Fuck.",1
The Aussies have been misleading us about stoinis. Warne was right all along!!,2
Cricket's simple 22 players chase a ball around and Ricky Ponting's Team always wins.,1
Stoinis for MoM if he bowls decently well?,2
Okay stoinis take my money,1
does he only bowl good when Morgan's around,2
What were they smoking to send him in 7,1
"Terrible bowling.

Not a single yorker",1
">watson not reviewing lbw,


>rayudu highest score in yesterdays match


>stoinis highest score in DC

r/cricket in shambles",12
Damn Stoinis. This is some excellent hitting. Warne and Zampa both probably passed out by now.,2
Dang Stoinis. Bohot hard.,1
*Oh boy I Love when strokes hits hard*,2
"Just remembered 

Stoinis is a fresh ex-RCBian

Makes sense now",2
So that's why they call him Big Stoin,1
Stoinis is surprising himself haha,3
Russell level strike rate. With a lot more class and timing.,1
"Remember when RCB got 60 off the last 3 overs against KXIP, Stoinis was there too",3
"In other news, S. Warne was hospitalized for cumming too much after watching Stoinis",4
Zampa - goes back to his room starts brewing a fresh load of coffee.,1
Ben Chod Stoinis.,3
Stoinis proving the RCB curse is real,10
"Friendship ended with Indian players,


I love Stoinis now",6
"Stoinis at 3, hetmyer at 6. Easy",3
RCB left out both Jordan and Stoinis. It evens out.,8
"I'm going to stick my neck out and say this hasn't been very good death bowling, in my opinion",5
50!!!,2
Jordan seems to be from “xyz” Academy,5

"Oh fuck man, love it absolutely",2
Oh Dear,2
Kxip lacks 4th and 5th bowler.,3
Fuck yeah,2
RIP Jordan’s IPL career,2
King shit,4
"What an innings from Stoinis, single handily brought Dc back into the match",4
Thank you RCB,8

"Lmao, what an innings.propper whopping. Take a bow",3
Fuck this. Knew this fucker would play well against us. Looked like an amateur when he played for us,5
jordan has shat on the score,2
You can take Jordan out of RCB but you can't take RCB out of Jordan.,8
Where is that guy who said stonis will make 50 in four overs,4
Best half century of 2020,7
The man is a god,5
Stonis making my hardis,2
One word: RCB,7
Stoinis stonks,7

What an innings,3
Imagine if warne was in commentary,1
It’s a beautiful feeling watching English bowlers getting tonked all parks,2
Jordan with more runs in the bag than Delhi top order,6
Stoinis has single handedly rescued the DC innings to give them something to bowl at,2
CJ is so much better than this. Hope he doesn’t get axed off the back of this game,3
Lol Jordan what a fraud,0
Where is that guy who was going to ask his crush if DC hits 150?,6
Mkb stoinis Australia ke liye kabhi aisa khela tha kya,1
Game changer Indeed.,2

I want a Big Unit cricket flair. Phrase make it happen.,5
Really good stuff by Stoinis,1
Shane Warne would be so erect right now,3
No ball. My fucking god,3
"Take a bow, Marcus Stoinis. Exactly the reason why he shouldn't be batting up the order. Nobody else in the DC squad can do this job in the lower order.",4

HOW CAN A MATCH  BE AGAINST DELHI AND PUBJAB AND RCB BE THE BUTT OF ALL JOKES,16
Shambolic by Jordan,1
Good guy Stoinis not caring about his average,2
That was some epic stuff from Stoinis,3

"Wait, aren't you still run out despite a no ball?",2
No ball on the last ball yikes,5
Lol no ball!,2
Lmaooo no ball,2
Fuckin noey,3
This might be the only time in human history where the on-field umpire calling no balls might have actually affected something.,8

Who doesn't love Stoinis Sundays:),6
KXIP sold Sam Curran for THIS?,13
Stoinis was 4*(7) at the end of the 17th over and he completed with 53 runs from 21 balls including 7 fours and 3 sixes. What a knock and helped Delhi Capitals to go pass 150 mark.,18

DC essentially got the same score as MI despite a shit ass start.,8
Lmao Stoinis never played this well for KXIP,9
Bruh y'all were saying Jordan was a great death bowler 😂😂😂,3
"Guys Jordan scored more than Stonis, so stop criticising him.",6
Almost par score ... match is on now.,2
Stoinis flipped the game on its head.,5

Brilliant running there,3

Brilliant.. who would have thought we will cross 150.. at least something to defend now.. great innings by Stoinis.,10

Man I can see why Aussies hyping Stoin up. What an innings,12
Never put a English bowler on the 20th over we have seen that shit before.,10
 Atleadt dont get smothered by someone who didn’t give a single match winning performance for your team ! Ffs man !,7
I think Stoinis playing so well has to do something with him leaving RCB .(winks at Watson),5
Player leaves RCB and suddenly starts performing exceptionally. Wonder how many times before have we heard exactly that.,14
Stoinis’s smile says it all that he knows he is gonna play all matches in this IPL,10
The score just went from Hey dood to Hello Sir...,2

This has been peak entertainment so far,11
"Jordan is a pretty crappy death bowler. Idk where this notion comes from that he's a good death bowler, even after he gets consistently smashed at that time.",11
Cunts gonna have surprise tommorow morning.,33
why the fuck there's crowd noise during the interview,8
Thought this was going to be a one sided boring match after the first half of the innings.. Thanks Stoinis for keeping it interesting.,28
Why was neesh not chosen over jordan,7
Zampa gonna be celebrating in his room,14
Wow just like that in 3 overs it went from a subpar score to one that Delhi could very well defend.,7
30 off the last over lol,14
This just in Shane Warne has masterbated himself to death in his hotel room upon seeing Stoinis's innings.,14

Where is Shane Warne in the comm box when you need him?,3
Can someone confirm whether that guy had proposed to his crush as KXIP reached 150? I'm more invested in his love life than this match.,11
Petition to officially change his name to Daddy Stoinis.,18
that Stoinis smile at the end,9
"That is some crazy hitting. Weird thing is Stoinis did not look this imposing in England. I guess bowling is not as good. But Chris Jordan seem to be phoning in. He bowled so well in late overs in Aus ODI but here he did not bowl well at all. 

DC should be the favorite if they can take out Rahul early.",7
kxip really shit the bed at the end there. All that beautiful bowling from Shami and Bishnoi went in vain.,6

"Every time I bring up that Stoinis should be sent higher up the order the response I get *but Indian batsmen...* Like wtf? Have you not been watching this man in recent seasons? There’s definitely this prejudice that certain countries have better batsmen while other better bowlers, and honestly it’s not true, at least not always. 

And to be brutally honest, in recent times it’s Indian bowlers that have outshone their batsmen.",12
Kumble gonna be pissed.,7
"Did Stoinis just say ""Little Rishabh""? Lmao",8

I still believe in Maxi and KL. Go get em boys,5

Punjab should have played Porel instead of Jordan and Mujeeb instead of Gowtham.,-3
How long is innings break in IPL?,4
Where was this Stoinis vs Jordan in the 1st t20 penultimate over,3
"Exactly 100 runs in the first 17 overs, 57 in the last 3.",6
"Everbody : key battle is going to be KL Vs Rabada 



Long time KXIP fans : Maxi Vs Ashwin",32
"When Rabada and Norje bowl at KL, they should just whisper “Hardik Pandya” near him after every ball. He would become nervous and get out easily 😂",4
Let's be honest. All we need is being dropped from RCB to be successful in life.,27
If Maxi performs today it would turn out to be a perfect Sunday,2
Which betting sites accept Paytm ?,3
"Is there any team WITHOUT as west indian. 

PS: i like WI brand of cricket.",5
Welp bye bye Jordan. It was nice to know you.,3
Dropping Jordan for Mujeeb would make our tail long.,3
Don't want to reactionary but arshadeep singh in place of gowtham and mujeeb in place of Jordan next match.,1
I am seriously impressed by how well Bishnoi bowled today. It is very rare to see a leg spinner have such great control at such a young age.,17
Opinions on hetmyer,2
That moment when u realise a kannadiga bro is captaining Punjab and vice versa for Bangalore,10
"In between, DC took 46 balls to score their first 30 runs and just 6 balls to score last 30 runs.",11
Meh. Jordan had a bad game. People shouldn't read too much into it. He was quite good in the England Aus series. He'll be back.,6
Obligatory fuck RCB for releasing Stoinis comment,9
"Shit, I'm more than entertained for the next 3 days. Should I continue watching the match our call it a day? 🤔",3
Where's maxi batting? Want to stay up and watch but also need to sleep😴😴😴,5

Hoping for Kings Leven Rahul to score some crazy runs,4
Ash readying up for a Mankad,13
Still a bad decision by Delhi to not open with Stoinis because he got less balls to make an impact.,-5
How tf is the hindi translation for Nortje wrong again? Didn't they get the correct one for Ind SA T20is earlier this year?,5
" Reminder: Kings XI Punjab has the best powerplay spinner on the planet - Mujeeb Ur Rahman. He would have been lethal on UAE pitches. But still, they went ahead with Chris Jordan. Foolish stuff from KXIP.",8
How's nortje? Is he good?,2
Wow DC have Carey too +,6
Here I was thinking about criticising Stoinis inclusion in playing 11.,3
I have a feeling this will be a great first over. Don't know for which side though,4
Only thing left for KL do to is open the bowling for Kings XI along with Shami,6
62 from Rahul today,5
Rahul going for that dhoni spot in the Indian 11 but he needs to understand that dhoni does not open.,4
"Most expensive 20th overs in IPL:

Woooooo,2
"Holy shit Ash, suck that ponting",4
Nicholas Pooran is not here anymore 💪💪💪,1
Now talk nah.,3
I am supporting Punjab but i will never not celebrate Comrade Ashwin's success.,10
Ashwin is doing his thing and all of us are loving it,8
Ashwin is B A C C,6
Didn't realize but KXIP batting line up looks weak. No top quality Indian T20 batsmen apart from Rahul. *This comment gonna bite me in the ass*,8
Ah the good old commentary of Pant from the wicket,5
Don’t think it’s fair on a player to captain him 1 season and then ship him off to some other team the next . (Ashwin) it reflects poorly on the management,5
2 wicket in first over ... Ashwin macha I knew you will do good for us.,11
[deleted],10
And r/cricket was asking Ashwin to retire when he didn’t run for a second,17
That's the first time I've seen Ashwin's mid-action pause work,3
You can't write this bc. bund mara ashwin,5
Classic Ashwin damn,7
Who needs Mankad when you can bowl like that,10
No need for Ashwin to Mankad if he bowls like this :),21
I am so erect rn,10
Ethics class is in session!,8
"Ethical bb, missed you so much 😘",12
We want Sarfuu!!,6
Don't need mankads if batsman can't play straight deliveries,6
"Yeah, Mayank looking solid out there. I think it's vital that he sees his team through to lunch.

Edit: Give the first couple of hours to the bowlers and milk them for the rest of the day.",22
Congratulations DC,3
Game on boys,8
Best ball in this season so far,7
Ashwin ate Pooran Poli,12
Stop ball is baaack booiiis. We gonna get vintage Ashwin this season with all his tricks. Love it,11
Ah shit here we go again,7
Ethical magic,3
Nicholas Chooran,7
Holy,3
"What an entrance from Ashwin, against his former team. Respect",7
Gayle was benched for this :((,10
"**5.5** Ashwin to Pooran, OUT, **through him!** Ashwin is off and jumping, he is loving this! Looks like the Ashwin floater, that comes in with the angle. **34-3**

N Pooran  b Ashwin 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
Lmao as if the stop start action actually worked,5
why was Ashwin kicked from KXIP,5
Ashwin just stopped for fraction of second in his bowling stride... I was worried for mayank... And there pooran fucked up,4
Rabada to Maxwell please. Thanks!,3
"Meanwhile unbeknownst to me, Liverpool have completed Thiago's signing... haven't been keeping up with the r/Liverpoolfc sub since it got toxic.",-1
"just FYI, pooran means centipede in tamil",6
Ashwin taking revenge on Kumble XI P,9
r/deathrattleporn,2
"I said, certified freak

Seven days a week

Wet arm ball spin

Make that  power game weak",3
"If the first powerplay is an indicator,  not looking good for the kings..",2
Pant chirping lmao,3
Ash is on fire,3
"After Stoin, I have big hopes from Maxi",3
That is what Ashwin do to batsmen in test cricket,4
Pant is sooooo annoying behind the stumps,7
ETHICAL UNLEASHING VENGEANCE ON ZINTA,8
Cmon boyz...,4
Ethical Aswin getting wickets so Aussies can watch Maxwell before the fall asleep,6
Oh no he is injured,1
What happened to ash he looked in pain,2
Lmfaoooo Rishabh Pant with his trash talk already,7
MAXWELL settled in is game over for DC.,1
bow down to comrade Ashwin bitches ^^^else ^^^will ^^^be ^^^sent ^^^to ^^^gulag,5
Omg ash diving....... aah shit,5
Come on Maxi let's see some of that 2014 magic!,3
Yo ash down on ground.,6
switch to dugout if you wanna hear pant on stump mic,4
My boy Maxwell is here,2
"Dammm, yesterday Ambati and today Ashwin, this ipl seems all about revenge against your old franchise.",6
Since when did England get a team in the IPL,3
"Why the hell is he diving!!

Looks like he hurt himself!",7
Fuck fuck fuck he looks injured,6
Ok wtf is this mid pause thing? Is this the new norm?,2
WHAT THE FUCK,3
I think Ashwin is injured,2
Ethical telling kids that diving in football is bad,5
Ex- Punjab Bois wrecking through current Punjab Bois. As a Delhi fan - you love to see it.,1
Where is the guy who wanted ashwin to retire or play TNPL?,6
Uh oh,1
Ashwin and Stoinis on a redemption arc,3
Ethical in labor pain,1
No nononono,3
Injured no no no,3
I had a feeling that 2 wkts would come in this over.  I was half expecting a hat trick,1
"Anil Kumble : we are prepared for Ashwin threat, our batsmen won’t cross the line

Ashwin : cute",11
"In the world of full of fantasy cricket,play fantasy saxxx",4
Ashwin fucked up,2
Ashwin dived like half an hour after the ball passed him and has risked an injury.,4
Gas ban'ni shuru Ashwin ke,4
"What the fuck Ash, you HAD to dive.",0
ethical wicket,0
No Ashwin no!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Behenchod why dive like that?,0
"As good as Piyush was yesterday, why didn't CSK bring back Ashwin man? Would've been perfect.",2
"Wow. Ashwin is so pumped that he actually dived to save a run of his own bowling. It’s a miracle!! 

Edit: holy shit. Did he just get injured??",3
Looks at the way Ashwin stops just a bit before delivering. Playing one last mind game trick,5
Why the fuck did he dive? No point diving there.,4
"Ashwin mankads a batsman and Rabada gives him a send off.

Ideal dismissal for DC. Please make it happen.",8
That doesn't look good for Ashwin,2
"If you dive while weighing a 100 kilos, guess what happens!",0
Why would u dive idiotic aswin.,3
Oh I thought he stopped half way through his delivery stride as he was after a cheeky mankad,6
Prithvi Shaw looks like Stewie from family guy with a mustache,4
"I know we've seen a T20 batting masterclass from Stoinis today, but for me there's been nothing as joyous as Ashwin taking pauses and the non striker keeping an eye on his release in this season so far.",7
"That was such an unnecessary dive, if he was fat he wouldn't have even bothered",8
2 wickets and off injured. Oof.,4
I have the perfect strategy for RCB next year(C'mon we all know that this also won't be our season). They just pick one player each from all the other teams and each of them may perform will trying to prove a point against their previous team for not retaining them.,4
Nooooooo,1
"Ashmin about to die, quick lets go to commerical

Edit- the TV coverage sucks",10
Ah man that doesn't look good,3
Ashwin You Da Boss!,3
This is the problem if you get over excited. His iPL is probably over :-(,1
Oh fuck no no NO,5
Aw no man,2
That was an unnecessary dive and ponting looks pissed,10
"There should be a tri series between KXIP, RCB and DC.",27
Chelsea 0-1 Liverpool if anyone's wondering.,3
Fuck DC. 😢 Ashwin ded for Aus series,8
Pls don't get injured :(,5
F,2
Looks like a fracture. Damn. He might miss the season,3
The heck they not even showing Ash injury on my TV,2
Didn't need to dive there.,1
Wtf looks painful,1
Shit I don't think the shoulder got dislocated but the way he's reacting makes it look really bad,5
This Alia bhat ad is so disgraceful n annoying,2
Oh god he looks close to crying,1
F,3
The memes just make themselves,1
Pls be okay ashwin,3
Of course the old fucks in CSK don’t get injured but the ones in Delhi do lol,6
Feel sad for him looks a dislocation he wanted to prove his credentials,2
Maxi already fucking up Ashwin,6
F,2
That dive was so not worth it,7
Omg Ashwin!! Hope it's not serious,3
Best fielder in the capitals on the field,1
"Is that a shoulder dislocation? It's on the left shoulder, can be fine after a few hours.",3
where ver u when aswin is kil?,2
Omg that was so sad. Hope is okay.,3
Hopefully nothing's broken,7
We're gonna have to play like 5 debutants in the Australia series at this rate,7
Ashwin might be ok if it’s just a dislocation,7
"Am I blind? That looked like absolutely nothing to me. Still unsure what he's done, hyperextended elbow?",8
Maxwell vs Rabada what are the stats,1
This is why people made of glass shouldn't throw balls at other people or something like that,-13
That's an old man injury. Did not look like he landed that badly at all .....,1
"Fuck, no Ash.",6
Alright guys which Maxwell is it gonna be tonight,3
He almost cried,10
Absolutely hate it when sportsperson get injured while doing their best.  It sucks.  Hope he is better soon.,26
KXIP do a couple favors for Ashwin in the beginning and then Ashwin returns them back immediately.,6
"Hope Ashwin is well. Is back next match. 

Looks very good in the 6 balls he has bowled.",5
Has he fractured his hand,3
Fuck no ash,5
"Oh man, that looked painful 😔",4
Why Ashwin why 😭,7
WHY WOULD YOU DIVE THERE MAN FFS,6
Maxi please,3
Ashwin gone massive win for Punjab,3
"""Shoulder Joint is a very peculiar joint""? Lol wut? What are you talking about Sanjay Banger?",3
Y’all saying he shouldn’t have dived. I get that. But how many have you played when adrenaline is pumping ?,13
[removed],-25
Dhsbsbsbsksksndbxmaak,1
Oh dear,3
Fuck no,3
Lmao that was agricultural maxi,5
These fuckers will get out for 50,6
"He probably dived like that a hundred times without anything happening, quarantine body.",5
Kagiso vs big show,2
Rabada Rabada Rabada,4
RIP KXIP,4
Hahahahahahah,1
cmon maxwell. let the hope be alive,3
I just hope it wasn't a serious injury.,4
Ashwin short spell was impactful af,4
"Ashwin didn't even need to sibe there.. needless injury..

And maxi goes... What was that shot btw..",7
4d underwater chess by Ashwin to finish IPL 2020 with the best economy and average of all bowlers.,12
Pfft,2
Maxwell masterclass,7
I think he dislocated his shoulder.,7
Wtf is that shot ?,6
Go back maxwell,2
Peak KXIP,2
Oof,1
So Delhi might win this match ... how about that,3
"Right so IPL is officially not real cricket, good night all",5
VILLAGE,2
Maxwell gone. Punjab fucked.,1
Nice.,1
Good batting from Mayank this session. Needs to bat this one out and runs will come in the next few sessions easily.,3
"Oh dear lord, what kind of shot was that?!",1
Ah that was definitely worth staying up for...,7
maxi doing a maxi.,3
It's over boys.,1
Punjab being Punjab,4
"Lmao Stoinis zero -> hero, Maxi hundred -> zero. Funny thing this life is 🤷",8
ITS THE KGB boys,1
"Oh delhi, you beauty",1
"Kings are just throwing the match away, smh.",2
Punjab looks like a very pathetic team. They might end up on the 8th spot this year,8
Maxi back in form.,2
This is some comeback after being 100/6 in 17 overs!,6
"Hope Ash is alright though, how bad is shoulder dislocation?",6
Memeswell,7
DC and KXIP both competing to claim the title of *Collapse Kings*,7
"Well, everyone wanted Maxwell to bat early. But no one said he had to stay in long",9
[deleted],2
What a meme game,8
Old Maxwell is back,5
RIP KXIP,4
This outfield is not fit for cricket. Groundsmen should be penalised.,6
Wtf Maxxi,2
When the opener is still at 5 and they are 4 wickets down,7
How should we react to this match?,2
I'm missing Preity's dejected face right now.,9
FFS,5
"Stoinis stonks

Maxwell no stonks",7
Well that didn't last long.. as if anybody expected it to.,5
That was such a bad shot. I can't emphasize enough,6
"Maxi, first of all- how dare you?",6
Time for Sarfuuuuu,3
Ashwin dislocates his mankanding arm 😌,0
"**6.3** Rabada to Maxwell, OUT, **taken at mid-off!** The collapse continues. **35-4**

GJ Maxwell c Iyer b Rabada 1 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00",6
Good ol maxi going off in solidarity with ashwin,11
Lmfao what the fuck is going on,3
"LMAO THE CLOWNERY, JEEZ GUYS",5
 big show not today,2
"Takes 2 wickets, attempts a dive and dislocates his shoulder, all in one over. Cannot get more Ashwin than that.",7
Maxwell in IPL - Ah shit! Here we go again.,2
Glennol Singh Maxwell flops,3
"From Udta Punjab to Tatti Punjab..
Sorry Preity your team is fucked againn",7
Why the fuck does Maxwell never seem to give a shit in IPL,6
Someone here said the other day Maxwell is never serious about IPL.,5
Gotta give credit where it's due. That Anil Kapoor ad is pretty funny.,5
There goes our Maxi and fantasy points,10
 Maxi Maxi Maxi,6
"Kumble is not going to last a whole season, he's going to have a major outburst and get sacked",9
Is Rahane in only for this over?,4
This is hilarious,6
My disappointment is unimaginable and my day is ruined.,6
Imagine dropping the t20 GOAT for this,5
"Iyer after catch was like, dude even we put more effort than this😢",5
"Move aside RCB, we have gotten a new meme team.",13
And I thought DCs batting was poor today.,4
Axar to play a stoinis and get KXIP home,4
That was peak Maxwell holy shit.,7
Man I really hope Ashwin is okay. I literally tuned in today to watch him bowl,10
"Ok so let's see how sarfaraz fares, has had a great domestic season",3
In the end only Mayank will be left,8
If movies and tv shows are to be believed you can push the dislocated shoulder back in the socket with one quick jab and you are good to go,7
Meanwhile Chelsea is being cunted by my man Mane!,3
Anyone has an idea about how long it takes to recover from a dislocated shoulder?,6
Stoinis took Maxwell's energy.,5
FFS give Carey the gloves mate,3
30/0 to 35/4. Oof oof,27
Garbage technique. Making Dubai look like edgbaston,10
Remainder - Sarfaraj  used to play for RCB,13
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/iwco31/match_thread_2nd_match_delhi_capitals_v_kings_xi/g5zrfjx?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

YES",4
Why does this donkey smile after missing such easy chances,-3
"Alright KXIP. The game is gone.

Sarfraz at least give some fireworks....",3
First slip!!,4
Learn something from Kedar Jadhav ffs never risks an injury even if the ball is going for a boundary.,25
Pant looks like the consumer of vimal pan masala,13
This is over lmao. Good game.,14
"Holy shit what's this collapse

And where's Gayle",4
Mayank cruising while others dropping like flies,2
Carey would have caught that,3
Dhoni would've caught that. /s,9
So yeah you see folks why Pant was awesome today.,2
Kepa is soooooo shit,2
which team is our Lord Benny playing this year?,1
The way KXIP batsmen are finding ways to get out is hilarious.,9
Does punjab have a stonis like player?,2
Maxi I love you and thnx for today but wtf. How can this man hit that 100 and then get out like this.,12
Why would u put sarfaraz in your playing 11 when u have other options,4
Is it only me or is pant also lookin chubbier ?,5
Ponting be like no worries we have 6 bowling options.,13
Other batsmen making Agarwal look good,7
AADHA AALOOO!,1
"Maxwell did a vice versa of Stoinis. Play for Australia, earn in IPL",12
Lol why's Bangar sitting so far off,2
Well It's all up to Sarfaraz (who?) and Mayank.,2
Only Pant can help Punjab now.,10
"Here people are celebrating a injury coz he is not following spirit of the game.


Wtf",8
Yasss heckin chonker Sarfaraz is here,4
"That was too near, getting a masterclass in collapse here",5
Didnt realize mayanks still there,9
From 30-0 to 35-4 ahahahaha,28
"Cmon Shreyas, give the ball to Prithvi, for the memes, cmon man!",9
Hope Ashwin gets better that was nasty.,11
Iyer bowls?,1
Had just switched on tv and saw ashwin on ground. Anyone knows what happened?,6
"Mayank on the other end looking at KXIP batsman

*fuck this shit*",5
Pant would have caught that,7
Amit Mishra is still there for DC,6
Does Pant still have a habit of shuffling towards leg side while keeping against fast bowlers ?,3
Kings XI again making sure the ratings don't break the ceiling.,4
I hope Ashwin is ok,8
"Dislocated Shoulders can take upto 2 weeks to heal, big loss for DC imo",12
EASYEASYEASY,2
Begjn the *Sarfraz redemption arc*,5
Ashwin was going to tear it up on these UAE pitches... hopefully he’ll be alright,9
"What do wicket-keepers do right that the others don't? Keepers dive frequently, and sometimes even land awkwardly, but never discloate their shoulder, but you always see batsmen and bowlers dislocate or hurt their shoulder whenever they dive.",7
Should've played Gayle you muppets,1
Friendly reminder that rabada has 344 international wickets while being only 25 years old and an express pacer,26
dream 11 team rekt today.,5
Axar Patel copied Murali Karthik’s action,6
Mayank playing an excellent test inning here,6
ngl sarfraz was  a chonker before chonkers were cool,9
"Ashwin is like I took 2 wickets, mera kaam ho gaya.",8
Rahane is not a bad fielding replacement at all,7
A chance for Mayank Agrawal to make himself indispensable,6
Lmao go mayank,1
Gayle died for this.,8
Agarwal on 6 after batting 7 overs lol,3
"Ashwin could have easily taken 1-2 wickets more ! What a shame , lost crucial points on fantasy cricket",6
That last ball felt like total gully cricket with hetmeyer picking it up,1
Sarfraz gets all his runs behind the wicketkeeper.,8
Comrade Ashwin fucked us up in only 1 over. There's no way we are winning this,8
What is this 0 force bowling ? Violates laws of thermodynamics,5
I hope Lokesh Hires Byomkesh for this Sorcery & Pathetic Collapse,9
Man that was such a beautiful ball by Ashwin. Looked fit and in form. Really hope he recovers quickly,18
"It should be the law that Pant, Bairstow and Wade need to be the international keepers just for the shit talk",14
Ashwin is going to be so dangerous on these UAE pitches.,11
[removed],12
I was just about to say that Ashwin looks in better shape than most other Indian players and jinxed him.,20
This is all part of the Mishra ji masterplan to get back into the team.,13
Ashwin would definitely hit commentary box post his playing career. But He needs to do more in his career before that though he is out of Indian short form teams.,8
Gayle must be loving this,11
I don't get it. Ball 4 and ball 5 were both straight balls.,2
People who said this is an one sided match earlier were probably right but for the wrong reason.,10
I guess coughing is the new sledging strategy for Rishabh Pant.,17
"How to play spin? 
Banger: watch the ball intently.",10
Gayle is going to choke someone.,11
Weren't Sarfaraz and pant u-19 team mates?,7
Which of DC and KXIP is the Pakistan of IPL? We all know RCB are the Windies of  the IPL. Entertaining and Dangerous but Shortlived,6
What a brain-dead performance after being ahead for first 15 overs of DC's innings. Why is karun nair even in the team let alone bat at no.3 ahead of Sarfaraz,15
Good to see  Mayank using the IPL as a rehearsal for the Australian test series,10
"Pant: oyeeehaihaihai

Everyone else:....",12
"**Maxwell in UAE**

2014 (95, 89, 95, 15, 6)

2020 (1)",23
Big papa Stoinis!,4
"Agarwal is trying to play anchor role, usually not his game though.",8
Sarfaraz is going to win it for KXIP.,3
And the man Stoinis comes to bowl. And commentators will start jerking off.,6
Funny how Bangar rambles on about something and then Dino just changes the topic,4
Test XI Punjab,10
Stonis is here,4
Oh yeah Stoinis bowls too,8
God damn I was so excited Ashwins Stop Ball was back. Don’t break my heart Ashley mama,13
Imo Maxwell should have been given a break. Didn't even bowl. They had so many options they could have tried. Gayle and neesham both spent so much time with the squad and also played practice match.,7
[deleted],33
"Round 2 for warne. 

Poor lad.",6
Wtf is this heavy length they talk about,3
Just arrived lads. Stoinis continuing the trend of former RCB players becoming gods after they leave the team lmao.,29
Ex-KXIP Players fucking over KXIP 🤝 EX-RCB Players fucking over RCB,9
"Put in neesh for Jordan next game, dude probably cost us the game. So shit",-6
"Delhi should play harshal Patel
Decent bowler, handy batsman",3
Now there should be at least one mankanding in honor of ashwins brilliant over,1
"With Ashwin injured, Ponting will be relieved. No mankad this season, no controversy.",16
Kxip is ded,8
Hindi Commentators trying hard to find rhyming words for Unacadmey & Dream 11,27
Man what's wrong with these two teams. No wonder they never won an IPL.,26
"I just hope DC becomes a good competitor for top 4. Tired of the other dominance.

Also punjab's batting makes it look like a last place candidate. Unless of course Rcb makes a case. Never rule out Rcb.",14
WAY WAY WAY TOO EARLY PREDICTION- *KXIP GONNA FINISH LAST THIS SEASON. GONNA BE ANOTHER LONG AND HARD SEASON FOR PRIETY*,4
[removed],-1
Ashwin has an economy of 6.8 in T20s being an off spinner. Remember him saying that he is as economical as some leggies and still has a lot to offer,12
Chonkers premier League,5
Stoinis and Ashwin have had maximum impact...,14
Delhi is so unpredictable.....Pakistan vibes,12
Who was the last Sarfaraz who didn't exude laziness?,6
"Such a cockblock for DC man, Ashwin was the key for a tightened bowling, not daying Mishra is any bad but Ashwin is a genius",22
What are other spin options for DC if aswin is out?,9
[deleted],6
Bad ground,3
Omg guys stop faking laughing,9
So If Delhi opt for a replacement of Ishant Sharma now... Will the replacement be available after 7 days or 14?,7
Lighting in the Dugout studio and the ground itself is terrible.,5
A boundary in the front?,3
What are the commentators smoking?!! Jeez!,15
Mayank slowly switches from Test to run a ball ODI mode. Yet to get into T20 mode,5
"Careful shreyas with those dives , it looks like carpet only have sand underneath..",8
Comedy nights with the commentators.,9
Why does it feel like punjab is batting for the last three hours,4
Is ishant out for whole ipl?,3
"The last time KXIP had a competent middle order, Kapil Dev was still captain",13
If DC win this with a bowler down KXIP will be second only to RCB for being a meme team,11
Can dhawan bowl now? Lol I remember once he was banned from bowling after he bowled an over,5
How the fuck do you play Axar Patel over Amit Mishra. Patel is useless with both bat and ball.,8
Mishra ji -stonks,3
Hindi WhiteHat Jr add is Cringe AF,4
commentators u have achieved komedi,7
"To fill Ashwin-sized hole in the squad, play Lamichhane and bin Hetmyer, Rahane would strengthen the top order too. Other option is to play Harshal in place of Nortje.",8
You need a strong core to dive safely. You will break things if you throw yourself like bag of bones.,7
"Remember Bois, the match is not about KXIP or DC, it is about RCB.",47
M not watching the match currently. What happened to ashwin?,6
Fake crowd noise > commentator’s fake laughs.,11
"As always, somehow Punjab’s team is one Batsman *and* one bowler short",14
Wait what happned to Ishant Sharma?,2
"The Whitehat Jr, Byju's, Upgrad and Jio ads are going to cause cancer rates to go up in India.",16
Wait where/who was iyer looking at after taking the catch?,8
That Mrf kohli ad is uncanny.,8
Dubbing of mrf is so shitty man... Lmao,6
Dislocated shoulder means Ashwin is out for the tourney most probably yes? Such a shame.,7
I can see more RCB flairs in this thread than KXIP.,17
"Cornell , Jordan can bat?",2
"Just reading the words ""D/L par score"" gives me the chills",4
"Nair is not a fucking T20 player. I hate Kings XI management, no continuity, too many changes and fuck Preity Zinta",9
I have a feeling mayank is going to fuck axar in next over.,3
Kumble is not going to be in a good mood tonight.,4
Mayank Singh Dhoni,8
Maxwell is such a fkong retard bruh,-1
Man Stoinis has some juicy biceps,4
Jeez Stoinis. Even his throws are going to the the other end of the ground,11
Ponting moving like cricket's Mourinho,3
Kxip and rr are two teams which have more players than its fans:joy:,9
Oh how I missed Pants irritating voice 🥺🥺🥺,6
They’re in the 10th over and the opener has only scored 12 runs yet.,12
Does PRIETY have a child? Does she qualifies as a milf? Will this comment gonna get me banned? Too many questions for KXIP.,22
Akshar Patels balls have the Dhokla energy,7
This is Krishnappa GOATham's first IPL game since his 134* (56) last year in the KPL. Obviously he's gonna take Punjab over the line.,15
I repeat every team has a krunal pandya.,11
"Yaa Allah Fielding 
Anil Bhai :p hindi commentory going Hay wire",11
Rahane will get a catch soon,3
They confirmed Ashwin dislocated arm,14
"Blame it on Mayank mf , had he been on same page as rahul at the beginning we wouldn't be experiencing this shit",3
55-5 in 10. So satisfying,10

This season is gonna be dogshit isn’t it,10

"Oh come on gowtham, all my money depends on you!",2
"Good night bros


Tomorrow will be fun day - RCB VS SRH",14
Axar patel=new ravi ashwin?,0
And I thought Delhi's batting was immature. What kinda shot is that???,4
UAE theory fail,0
Bowl out Rabada and Nokia now to win by a large margin. Thanks!,2
Why would you play down the ground. I knew his game is only scooping above wk head,4
Shaw with that mustache looks like mr potato head,10
"**9.6** Patel to Khan, OUT, **holes out to long-on.** Flat length ball outside off, steps out and doesn't make the pitch of that. So he's forced to hit that on the rise. It comes off the inside half of the bat and finds Shaw  about five yards in from the line **55-5**

SN Khan c Shaw b Patel 12 (12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",3
Prithvi shaw with his mustache is looking like Ravi Shastri,12
Mayank Agarwal has started match practice for Ind-Aus series 😂,8
"Show us Preeti""s cute face now",11
Why no mandeep in this team,7
What was rcb thinking retaining sarfaraz,9
Rawrrr. THis KXP is shit if you take out KL. Definitely will finish at the bottom.,8
Nothing expresses your excitement better than BHENCHOD,9
Who are the next batsmen in line for KXIP?,4
Any news on Ash?,10
Match between the worst teams is just as entertaing as the 2 best teams.,18
Imagine losing to a team with a bowler down. KXIP are an absolute meme,14
Karnataka boys to bring it home for Punjab.,14
Kxip’s batting lineup is so pathetic that there’s an uncapped bowling allrounder at 5 down,14
Where are the people writing us off after the Shami spell?,7
"Man put on preity zinta on webcam, beam it across the stadium and make this exciting",9
"The one thing every Delhiite wants to see, even if it is for just one season

Kohli playing for Delhi",22
"Ashwin now thinks - ""I don't need to bowl again"". Stoinis goes ""I didn't even have to score that crazily"". It's such a night",13
Inb4 gowtham 50* (12),12
So... KXIP... what's the game plan?,13
I can't wait for Rabadas 2 overs 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁,8
PP has facial hair now?,7
"So in conclusion, if your team looks good on paper, they'll compete for the bottom 4",50
Any tips to get arms like Stoinis,3
All ex RCB folks playing like true RCBins,12
Preity Zinta is now Plastic junta,2
Ah yes Big dick Gotham,7
"Fifty five for five so far, so KXIP will finish on tenty ten for ten at this rate. Easy",9
Chaliye kxip ko vanakkam,9
I don't get that Dream11 stream thing. I don't know how people do it unless they're being paid for it.,2
Poor captaincy bowling Stoinis. Finish the match. Bowl Nokia or Rabada here.,-2
Just hope KulCha can do better this time with the bigger boundaries,6
Shaw's mustache and hair look so pedo but the rest of his face looks younger than 18...,13
Kxi old,5
"Mark my words, KXIP gonna be last in the table. Their squad is inconsistent af. Most of them never played together. Nair doesn't deserve a spot in playing XI. Need better 4-5th bowlers. Also, Maxwell needed rest for today's game. Could have played Neesham/Gayle.",9
Just read about Ishant. Oh god please I hope its not serious. I have rooted for that guy all his career. Things have just started to turn around for him. Hopefully he is available for Australian test series.,14
"oh I wish SN Khan, M Sharma, S Dhawan, P Shaw all played for Mumbai., so that I can hate MI even more",6

Extremely classy knock by Agarwal.,7
"KL is budget Rohit. Average batsman who looks good on batting friendly pitches, hasn't made one innings of repute since his maiden century in 2015. Should be exposed for what he is - average cricketer with great looking shots, and an average wannabe captain.",-11
He woke up,4
C'mon Mayank!,5
Ganguly looking at his my 11 team.,19
"Gowtham can really tonk the spinners, tho. Not sure how effective he will be against top quality pace, tho.",5
Slater saying ganguly enjoying the match. But he's busy on his phone.. Lol,10
Dada don't care about the match,5
Dada should put on the mask considering that his neighbour's dad had contracted covid recently,14
Mayank Agarwal 13 not out after 10 overs as a opener in a T20. Must be some sorta dull record,10
Shit luck for DC. Ashwin and Ishant out. Will be hard to find two Indian bowlers of similar caliber,6
"Watching Delhi games over the years, no game is won until it is won",7
"When we played Colony Cricket, we had one batter play for both sides... could be Stoinis will deputize for kxip?",7
Realised he is playing T20,4
"That wasn't mayank ,it was the Stoinis touch",7
Ishant and Ashwin being the head of Indian pace and spin department ;both injured makes me wanna cry in corner,10
2 matches in and already the batsman getting exposed when their mishits don't go for 6. Love it.,9
the camera man trying to focus on that one single spectator /s,10
Viewership of the match went from 40L to 28L on hotstar,9

How's Ashwin injury? any news?,3
Axar looking like Doppler ganger of Krunal.. Both ran away from rehab,7
Prithwi Shaw went from an innocent teenager to a 30 year old really quick,11
KXIP already starting playing for NRR,8
Wicketkeepers in the out feild are funny.,1
"Both teams decided to keep this match interesting so far, you won't score? We won't either hmph.",2
Why sardarji is dancing in loop lol,2
These virtual fans seem fake af .. how all of them make similar gestures?,3
Stump mic needs a Pant filter,4
Pant needs to stfu,5
Axar's action looks suspiciously chuck-like to me.,2
Remember when DC choked against KXIP last year?,6
Shivani Choudry looks pissed,8
Gowtham looks more settled than hetmyer or shaw.,4
Man that CEAT Fan Screen thing was so cringe,4
"What will KXIP do now? Continue playing like a test, get a respectable score and preserver RR or go bonkers and implode for 80 all out?",4
"Shaw should give a YT tutorial on ""how to look 40 at 20,""",11
Stop yelling pant bc,10

At this rate gowthan is gonna get 12* (50),8
Punjab need to cut their losses and look to protect their NRR,9
Gowtham looks shrewd asf,5
A fat Indian uncle blowing a flying kiss is just really wrong,34
Man these cam fans are real cringe along with their poor acting skills.,26
I see Maxwell used up his whole IPL worth of luck in the last ODI. Wouldn't be surprised if he's rubbish for the majority of the tournament.,14
Mayank seems to have lost lot of weight. At least he looks good for Aus Test series :-),3
"KXIP management should realise playing Nair & Agarwal together is a disaster for recipe in UAE. Either bring Gayle in for Agarwal or Mandeep in for Nair. Both Nair & Agarwal rely on boundaries to release pressure which is not easy to come by here. In fact, only KL & Mandeep are good at converting 1s into 2s in this squad which will come in handy later on.",12
Priety should just sell KXIP on EpixCash and get it over with,10
How many innocent teenagers do you guys think will get arrested trying to climb the pyramid like ranveer?,7
Most teams kind of have a liability batting at no 7 it seems.,3
DC and CSK are defo finishing 1&2 not necessarily in that order. It's going to be a real ugly scrap for the other 2 spots. DC look really solid despite no Ashwin or Ishant for the whole season. They can still play Mishra for Ashwin and continue with Mohit Sharma and look damn good. Go far bois! I'm rooting for you!,3
"Someone said mayank will fuck axar

"Indian government if you're reading this , ban every app that has ads in the IPL this year",2
Lmao hetmeyer is lazy AF,10
Nortje is a good buy for DC imo. He has been really impressive,3
Punjab shouldn’t have done away with Ashwin. Senior and experienced Indian players are always the core of a successful IPL team.,10
Nice shot,3
How did Ashwin get injured? Missed it,2
"Way too many administrative people in the stadium. Hopefully, they dont end up bringing in corona and hence destroying the event.",2
"Feel for Shami, rare economical bowling in ipl..and batsman after batsman shitting on his effort.",12
I hope mayank don’t pull out stonis in death overs,2
Get mayank out,2
Fuck Akash Chopra... All my homies miss sidhu's commentary,16
kings are still ahead in terms of runs.,-1
Will this go to day 3?,20
DC is challenging their inner RCB,7
KXIP can still win this if they think that they are playing against RCB. It's all in the mind you see.,17
Mayank new wall,3
Joe mama so fat jokes won't work on Hetmyer,4
Mayank is defs quality over quantity this innings. Not scored nearly enough runs but what he has scored has been gorgeous so far.,7
Miss those early days of Mayank IPL career where he would come in hit a six and the get out.,31
Stabilization^TM,5
Great batting. Mayank would have been the perfect middle order bat for RCB,3
Mayank looking to start going ham here? Is he going to be able to see them over the line?,2
Come on Kannada Boys..for the Love of Lassi & Patiala Peg show us some Fight,2
"Playing in UAE isn’t too different for KXIP, they’re used to not having fans",16
"Just wanna say, Hetmyer and Pooran are wasted talents so far. You can be the most talented guy in the room but it doesn't matter if you're not consistent. The only reason they've been in the Windies squad consistently is cause the rest of the batting lineup is quite shit. But I wouldn't be surprised if they get replaced by next season if they keep performing like this.",7
"So yeah, you were making fun of Mayank's dot balls.....only his way is working.",6
Mayank's backfoot play is so good. Great seeing an Indian player play such shots.,4
Mark my words. Mayank captain mext season. And rahul goes to rcb,6
Mayank is {coming into his own}^TM,0
Wtf! Rahul looking more and more like Kohli with each passing day.,6
Just seen the score after watching the football. Ffs,-1
I'm running out of fingers to count the number of fantasy cricket games. What's with the absurd recent surge of these games?,5
How do you rate Mayank's innings so far?,2
Has anyone here ever won big in any fantasy cricket league?,7
"Every team has that one lone warrior 
Kolkata has russell
Delhi has stoinis

didn't mayank open the innings?,4
Haha! Rabada with the push to the ball..,1
"Rooting for Punjab this match, Delhi is too good this season and if they gain momentum they will steamroll everyone and everything in their path.",8
"My god, Mayank is so good on the eyes",5
Just a single? Wtf,4
"Why is Maxwell so hyped, he tried to hit a ridiculous shot when team was in trouble. Even though he has skills he disappoints most of the time especially in ipl",13
Rabada is a meme in the outfield,6
People on this sub need to stop hating everyone who plays slow at start.,21
I think cardekho have kidnapped Dravid's family,8

If Mayank and gowtham pulls this match... Can imagine gowtham pulling out his jersey in joy... Remember his innings against MI,5
Axar moving towards his career best figures,5
Why does Pant screams like a pornstar every delivery,9
Whoa.. Maxwell average is 19 in IPL in India. Wtf?,13
Why is Pant shouting even when single is taken?,4
Girl is cute,8
Fucking pant shouts all the time and tells others to go “eAsY”. Fucking shut the hell up,2
Pant's screams > fake crowds,17
"rip chasing it now, Rabada still got 2",4
The chick is cringy af,11
Mayank's gotta do something at some point right?,2
"What the fuck are they talking about? The RR is 11+, game is already lost.",5
KKR should have a brain fart where they sell Gill to KXIP because they feel bad for them.,11
Awesome spell from Axar,4
Shaw carries that look so that Mishraji doesn't feel old,3
"RCB vs SRH tomorrow ?  SRH looks better, much better.",3
"4 overs 14 runs 1 wicket!!

That is exceptional.",8
Letting Axar get away with 14 off 4 overs....smh my head,7
Excellent spell by Axar,0
"That cred fan power ad is cringe.
Don't@me.",3
Match ain't over yet,2
People should learn how to cheer from BYJUS,6
Wow Maxwell averages just 19 in IPL played in India,9
Petition to rename KXIP to Karnataka XI Punjab if these two pull it off.,11
"Imagine you're a player all serious and focused about winning a cricket match, then you see a weirdo on a giant screen for winning a contest you have no idea about.",7
It makes sense to not risk run outs instead go for boundaries and sixes. This is reverse dhoni.,8
Someone please stop this live fan cringe fest,5
"KXIP is the ultimate meme team lmao. At least RCB gets the limelight, they just perpetually fly under the radar while being complete shit",10
"74 in 6 overs, 2 from rabada?",6
So Josh is a replacement for tik tok?,3
Pant must be good in bed...any news if he is single?,4
"Maxwell averages 19 in 63 innings in India and somehow keeps getting these big contracts 

\- Scott Styris in the dugout

P.S : I know IPL is being played in UAE but Kings XI didn't know that when the auction happened.",14
Scoring only 14 off Axar. Lol. KXIP proving again why they’re second only to RCB in terms of being a meme team,4
Nice to see them playing the orignal Nari nari song. The new remix sucks,5
6 over me 74. Lauda!,6
"KXIP: Noooo you can't hit a premier death bowler like Jordan for 30 runs in the last over

Stoinis - Deja Vu I have seen this before,7
Gowtham coming at us with his 50(15) masterclass.,4
Gowtham needs to fire like he did for RR in that one match Bumrah was bowling.,5
What happened to KXIP post 2014? They had that one amazing season. Played the most entertaining brand of cricket in the IPL ever,8
I’m not panicking you’re panicking,10
Can delhi channel their inner rcb rn,8

thats a real nice shot by Gowtham,1
Mohit Sharma's pie shop : now open for business,2
Ouch at Mohit's crap. He lacks pace to bowl so short. Hopefully Ishant is back soon.,2

fkk I still remember warner bairstow bromance against RCB,13
"Remember last IPL when we thought DC were easily winning against KxiP but then they choked and lost, handing Samuel Curran a hattrick along the way?",13
Rumour has it that Dream11 is not going to open its game  for RCB matches because they feel it's truly not left to chance.,12
So no Kanos huh?,3

Punjab can still win this,4

Preity putting on some make Up just in case ..Punjab de Kannada Puttars clinch it,10
Surely we can do better than Mohit “accountant” Sharma,-3
Ponting might be really happy looking at ishant and Ashwin injuries,-13
How good is Rabada at Dubai pitches for death overs ?,2
Looks like the whole city is under electrical shutdown just to power the stadium.,13
60 in 5 is gettable.,3
Y'all remember the the first DC vs KXIP game last year? When Curran got a hattrick and DC lost like 7 wickets in 3 overs or something 😂,1
Unironically like that ad with manoj vajpayee,3

They are gonna win it arent they.....,3
JUST LET THEM ADVERTISE ALCOHOL DIRECTLY.,5
DC Channeling their inner RCB I see,6
"Honestly, some of these players need to take a good look at themselves in mirror. 

I've counted close to a dozen players who have showed up terribly out of shape, and we've seen only four teams play. I honestly can't imagine this happening in any other sport. 

It's so embarrassing to watch. This is supposed to be the best league in the world and *this* is how seriously the players take themselves? Ridiculous.",13
Anyone watching in the USA? How can I watch online?,1
Jeez sex offender drops ball...,6
Mayank trying to hit rabad with his wrist power wow!,1
Press F for rabada.,2
In a few days u will see rcb fans commenting how they can still qualify,14
That drop is gonna cost a lot lmao,1
Small hands cost him.,1
Shit fielding,1
thicc boy Shaw has already taken his share of catches,1
Should have caught that.,2
"Be honest, none of you believe Shaw could have caught that.",22
Shaw is a terrible fielder. Seem to recall him dropping catches for India too,5

Pant didn't even realise lmao,10
Rabada is the best thing Delhi did in their existence in the IPL.,26
It's over guys . Aggarwal hardly looks like he can accelerate,3
that was a soft dismissal. Let us see what Jordan can do.,3

Unpress that F.,1
"Got to wonder why Gowtham who has performed year after year for Karnataka doesn't get a call up, but Krunal pandya, who skips most Ranji games, gets an international cap",12
"Oh, what would DC be without Rabada!",6
"Calling someone a ""weapon"" in England you'd be calling them a penis",6
This has been an unreal choke by punjab. Conceding 57 off the last 3 overs (including 30 off the last) is just criminal.,5
Yeah wicket is cool but how good it is to watch IPL without annoying Vuvuzelas,4
Hope zamps’ playing tomorrow,3
Mayank's duty is to put pressure on the non striker.,3

Man Mayank Agarwal used to be a T20 specialist when he came on the scene. Sad to see his limited overs game take a back seat. But understandable. India finally has a Test opener.,2

Should have let gowtham bat however he wanted. Agarwal was nagging him like he is punjab's virat kohli.,3
Pant is just embarassing himself lol,4

Waah pyaare Axar height ka lauda istemaal,8
Shit fielding wtfff,5
No way Agarwal is winning this for KXIP. No way. Right? Right?,5
this is kids cricket fielding,7
This year's fielding is embarrassing. Understandable though.,2
Axar can't even field. Not even 1D player.,9
"If delhi loses, it would be because of fielding.",1
Fielding has been absolute dog shit this first two matches,2
That's why you never drop universe bosss,5
Do you guys listen to English commentary or dugout on hotstar s?,2
Gavaskar saying Jordan is pretty handy with the bat. NO HE ISN'T if he doesn't score more than 30 runs in 6 balls.,2
Ashwin looks sad :(,2
I think ashwin will be back in max 2 matches.,2
That's an ooooof,2
Just a reminder that Axar Patel was part of India's CWC 2015 roster,7
Ashwin was about to cry,5
"I like Ash, big fan but man he is unathletic.",2
Man I already miss ASH,5
Can Norje ever bowl a yorker?,7
Does anyone know if there's a way I can read this thread like the chats in livestreams,7
"Calm down, DC supporters. There's no way KXIP is winning this.",6
Mayank gonna get bowled just after his 50,7
This one has to go out of the park to have any chance,4
stop running on the pitch jordan,8
"Oh man you gotta feel for Ash :(

Imagine waiting to play for months and this happens!",13
"Stoinis, Rabada and Mohit left. Gettable",3
Need one 20 odd run over out of somewhere.,3
Stoinis still has to bowl an over. Need to take it for 20+,3
Scenes if mayank celebrates his 50,10
What happened to ash ?,1
Did Ashwin injure his mankading arm?,-1
DC fielding has been very poor,1

Where's the ula lala le o song... Man I miss those kingfisher ad,5
Wonder how that Ashley injury happened.. That fall seemed so tame.. Ugh must have hurt like a b,1
Only Shami can save this match  now for KX.,5
"For once Ashwin puts a 100% effort dive, and now he is in a sling. What a tragedy",7
Bollinger <3,5
Damn! Shreyas Gopal is so understated.,2
This is the over that kxip can change things,2
[removed],2
"If DC chokes from here, I am not going to do anything because I am kinda used to it now.",19
Bollinger with that 18.7 average,4
Is Ashwin injured I mean will he be out for a while?,2
I heard Ravi Bishnoi is a great hitter.,1

Harshal should play next match.",-1
Fucking hell,1
"Don't do this Delhi, I have high hopes on you.",6
**S C E N E S**,2
Y'all thinking Delhi capital fans are going to be hurt by this but don't forget before DC we were Delhi Daredevils fans. We are used to this,5
"Mohit to spice things up.
Thanks Mohit.",3
If only any 1 of the top order batsman had tried to stay there it,3
I really don't understand KXIP's strategy. Atleast RCB tries to maximize their revenue through Kohli and ABD.,8
Lol Delhi has a good knack of choking. Anything can happen.,8
"Are they batting to win or  for run rate  , now ?",1
"Mohit is gonna give 20+ this over, isn't he?",5
"Please don't give me hope, please don't do that.",7

Delhi CHOKERS,3
How delhi losing from that position,5
"Mohit Sharma is trash, pass it on",2
Why would you bowl to mayank there? He is too good straight down the wicket.,3
People forgetting Mayank was a T20 specialist.,3
Yes!!!,1
Absolute scenes,1
Why hasn’t Ashwin bowled himself?,2
Should have bowled Rabada to kill the game here bad captaincy,2
We're in danger,1
Delhi choking imao,3
Sunny g cumming somewhere,6
"What significance does ""wall* has to a 6?? Last time I heard wall it was for dravid and for a complete different reason.",2
Mayank just realised that he's playing T20 not a test.,2
Mayank Stoinis Agarwal.,2
Flashback of DC’s legendary choke against KXIP last year.,4
Dont give ball to mohit again,3
Fuck off dc srsly. Can we just have a decent finish,6
"Ahh mayank finally starts fucking

Now i can jack off to it peacefully",6
Delhi doing an rcb,5
RCB sure is playing well.,4
doubles every delivery and they win. Fuck,5
"This IPL is too unexpected Tiwary, Rayudu, Stoinis & now Mayank",9
Mayank heard you all talking shit about his strike rate,7
This is tremendous batting! Has seen the collapse and carrying the team alone.,7
Imagine if the last over went for 10 instead of 30,9
Depressing to see Mohit receiving such a beating. Seems such a nice lad.,3
If Mayank had a decent partner at the other end this would have been over by now,3
Did I just see Ponting slip his knuckle duster on??? Gonna be a nasty debrief.,3
Fucking hell,2
Doable for Punjab but let's see,3
Sam Curran last year. Mayank Agarwal this year. I guess the mandatory choke against KXIP is on.,3
Punter should just spit in his palms rub them and get in the field.,1
Oh Jordan a boundary please,2
Elite batting by Mayank in this over.,4
"Lmao imagine if Stoinks' over takes the game away from Delhi.

Poinis comes full circle",7
What batting man. With his limited hitting skilss,3
Someone make the spiderman pointing meme with Jordan and Mohit.,6
Will Avesh Khan get chance now,3
Someone Mankad Mayank already!,3
DREAM 11 GAME CHANGER ISS MAA KE LODE KO HI DEDO.,7
"Stoinis has to bowl one of the two remaining overs 
 
This is gonna get really interesting",6
"No one can lose from this position 

Delhi capitals : challenge accepted",16
Mayank making them pay after his dropped catch,2
Where is Ishant Bhaiya?,1
bowl rabada next over and Stoinis the last.,3
Game Changer Indeed.,3
Free hit for Jordan,1
People here have no idea how good Maybank is.,4
Why even Ash got injured smh,4
Mohit is the wrong Sharma,2
Both coaches know their teams can still lose from here :),2
how young is jordan?,1
Aggarwal has definitely cemented his position as an openor. Would be dumb to go back to Gayle now,5
That was very inspiring. Thank you Simon!,2
Jordan you absolute buffoon,1
Jordan with that trademark Vijay Shankar swing.,6
How the hell does the stadium not have good wifi?,3
Inb4 Comrade Ashwin comes back to have proper revenge.,3
Chutmarike Jordan!,3
Add 10 here from rabada and the game is k11s to lose,5
Jerking off to mayank fucking dc,7
"Mayank was: 38* (39)

Man this is still close,8
Cmon KGB,6
rabdi aint gonna give many.,3
25 from 12 is pretty doable how did this match end up close lol,8
Mohit Sharma almost did a Mohit Sharma here,11
Mohit yaar,2
I really wanted to root for delhi but man do they know how to pick chokers :/,2
This game is gonna be decided by which captain was worst than other.,6
"Bowl those thundercunt Yorkers and make us all wet. Please, KG!",3
Kg come onn,3

Rabada's here. No chance DC letting this one go,1
Chill bois. Marcus got the last over,1

"Super over would be cool too.  
  
Edit: This is cool",2
Who the F saves a Mohit Sharma over for the death?!?! lmaoo,1
"See, yorker is not easy to hit.",3
Both teams doing their best to take it away from their own team at the death,4
"If Jordan can make up for his last over, Punjab can hope.",2
"After a player makes *one* mistake

r/cricket : you suck. Boohoo",8
Hotstar stream glitching like crazy,2

Mayank and Jordan used the same towel.  Blehhhh,3
Perfection,2
KGB do some Superover Stuff,3
It will be KXIP,4
Oof what a shot,2
Haven't seen this Mayank since 2012 in IPL,5
69,8
Nice shot from Mayank!,8
"That last over truly fucked it up for Punjab. Good game for them, still gonna lose though.",9
Imagine if kxi needs 6 on the last ball and Jordan is facing stoinis,9
DC can't win if Agarwal stays,7
AgarWAR !!,5
Mayank is a fuckin beast,5
Wow!!,1
10 from this over should be enough.,6
Why are they sharing a towel?!?!,2
priety hugs,2
NOOOOOOO,2
kumble lookin more like ashwin than ashwin himself,3
DELHI CHOKERS,5
Brilliant quick running,5
Commentator called it a 6 then one bounce it was actually 2 bounce.,4
Jordan is so rapid,3
Ashwin had to play with Mohit Sharma and Barimder Sran. How they won anything is a mystery,3
"If you miss the hole, this is what happens - KP",2
Go on boys you can do this,1
That double barely crossed the 30 yard mark,1
Every year i think why Mohit Sharma is picked and every year he is still there.,1
GODDAMN WE GOT A GAME IN OUR HANDS,1
Jordan doing a great job here,1
agar(wal) tum mil jao,1
It's building up to Jordan finishing the game by hitting Stoinis I can feel it,2
Butt clenched,2
wow is that kumble in the kxip camp?,2
Was that the first yorker in Ipl.,2
"Mayank now.. Stoinis before.. way to go RCB..

only legendary clubs can give this power..😂",9
Aha old good A. Krumble,3
"Damn, Rabada starts with a great ball. Is Stoinis really one to ""close out a game""?",3
How can a bowling attack having two rsa bowlers not choke?,3
Kumble > Punter,4

Shiiieeeet,2
BC Haaro,1
Hahaha DC is channeling RCB,3
NO NO SHREYAS!!!,1

Fielding standards are way down,1
Punter: Bhenchoooodddd,9

You can trust Gavaskar covering up for any mistakes of a Mumbai player,6
Whyyyyyy,3

As the cliche goes Catches win matches.,3
Ooooooh fck me this is close,2

Is Delhi going to do a Delhi now?,6
Ponting : I think I should sub myself for these fielders .,6
Punjab's game now,2
BHENCHOD ME JAARA HU,6
Today is mayank's day,3
Faf could have taken that with his eyes closed!,5
Iyer keeping the match intrestingʕᵔᴥᵔʔ,3
Jordan better smack this,2
Jesus what is this fielding. Looks like corona has really hurt them,2
Rhodes is one handsome son of a gun,4
This is so painful to watch,3
This fielding has been abysmal,3
This innings reminds me a lot of Faf's innings in the 2018 playoff vs SRH.,8
All those shitting on Mayank. Where are you now?,6
Ponting might murder someone in DC,9
What did Ponting say? “________ would’ve caught that”,8
**GPL FIELDING**,6
"OH CAPTAIN, what have you done?",6
Ponting in a rage is tres tres funny,16
Angry ponting is my favourite ponting,28

So the winner of this game will be the one who plays less village,13
Mayank dropped twice off Rabada.,4
What is this match ?,5
The game started as a borefest and gotten real spicy. God! I missed cricket.,9
Punter will have a long chat with Iyer tonight,8
Make it stop already,4
The scenes if Jordan hits Stoinis for 2 or 3 boundaries in the last over to win it,11
This is what the difference between csk and DC .,7
Shit Kepas everywhere,9
"Jhonty Rhodes looking like a typical TV Show Dad, you know the ones who launder money or deal in drugs.",8
Mayank has been crazy lucky but this innings has been brilliant till now,5
There WAS a time when Iyer was Captain,6
Delhi vs KXIP is such a meme,12
What the hell was written on virats shirt 'pappacham' ..hahaha,7
Lo bhenchod gya match.,8
Mayank can pull this off.,9
Called [Mayank heroics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/iwco31/z/g600of7). Disclaimer: didn't believe it might happen,3

Welcome back IPL :'),5
Should have had Gary Pratt on the boundary Ricky mate,1
Mayank is spent still going.,2
We were so close ... that catch was the turning point.,7
Ashwin's dive is proving out to be super expensive.,5
"Agarwal catched up well, if only he can finish ..if only.",2
The fielding in these 2 games my fucking God.,5
Jordan vs Stoinis in the last over plz.,2
I love you Monkey. I am very sorry for doubting you earlier.,2
I thought they were nowhere near winning a few overs ago but its actually got close now,6
Stoinis to bowl last over who wrote the script,8
Mayank getting tired in a T20 inning tells you that he’s literally carrying the entire Punjab batting on his shoulders today,7
It's very tough to play for long in UAE. Even Rayudu was struggling yesterday,3
Why they no play Neesham?,2
Seems like Punjab have it in the bag after those missed opportunities,1
Rabada had 2 catches dropped off his bowling,2
Jinta aunty is happy,1

It's stoinis's day,4
This is the guy who use to come hit one 6 and get out. Now he's India's test match opener and playing so well here.,11
Getting sick of these fantasy league ads,2
Stoinis : welp ..,3
Pontin g on that drop was livid. He wouldnt have dropped it when he was a player.,7
F boi fucked it up .. How criminal it is,3

I think he just gave up on the match and said screw it to Iyer’s call for standing inside the 30 yard.",6

This match had more twists than Abbas Mastan movie.,3
DC and KXIP sharing choke like coke,1
I feel sorry for the people who don't follow the IPL,9
Why do other teams want DC to lose?,2
"Maxwell, Pooran, KL?",3
All the people who are saying this is a fixed game & if you’re serious then why are you watching it?,7
"When its a crunch situation u search for rsa players 

When its a super over u search nz players

Unleash jimmy neesham now",7
Will KXIP be the chokers of IPL...man this match is giving the vibes of those T20s between IND and NZ at the start of the year...,7
That short run fucked everything for KXIP,8
LOL What a match!!,5
this whole game was essentially a protracted “no u”,15
What the hell happened here,5

Why am I getting turned on by Ganguly’s super cajsh look,0
Who's gonna bowl the super over for kxip ? Bishnoi ?,1

"Bruh. This has been a shitty year. Over all and personally. I don’t even feel like commenting on reddit anymore. Didn’t even wanna see this match. But I am a DC supporter or as more commonly known as masochists. I genuinely laughed out aloud seeing this last over. Felt kinda good. No matter how much I hate IPL for not being “pure” enough, nothing gives so much pure stupid dumb pleasure on a boring alone Sunday night as IPL. I missed it man",6
quick script being written as we type here in this thread.,3
Friendly reminder that the third ball of the match was four wides but it was incorrectly given as 4 leg byes,1
"Soooo much drama in this game. Shami fire breathing, Stoin hulking out, Ashwin 2 wickets + injury, Mayank going balls out, and now super over. Beautiful",3
Ashwin should bowl,2
Great innings from Mayank. I am happy for him. But what a FU from KXP. Hope they do well in Super Over.,4
[deleted],2
You can take the IPL out of India but you can’t take the India out of the IPL,2
Short run wrongly given umpires shd b fined for fuck up. Whay can't third umpire come in cricket rules are so stupid,2
This is like wc final when umpire gave 6 instead of 5 lol,4
"I didn't see the match just the scoreboard.

  


Ashwin got two wickets in a single over and didn't bowl the rest of the match?

  


Wtf??",3
Ashwin changed the match with his presence and absence. Will miss him :-(,3
Now every future IPL season should have a super over game with Delhi or I’m not watching.,2
That's not a short run. KXIP got robbed,4
Already give player of match to stoinis,1
Can't see KXIP losing this.,1
"N̶e̶i̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶e̶a̶m̶ ̶d̶e̶s̶e̶r̶v̶e̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶l̶o̶s̶e̶ ̶h̶e̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶t̶i̶e̶d̶

Neither team deserves to win hence tied.",2
That short run is a joke. Why don't they check those calls routinely if run outs are pretty much always checked? It's the same camera. Makes no sense to me whatsoever.,5
"If they can deduct the run, they should add it back now",2
"Umpire is lucky that this not against big ,3",3
Ravi Bishnoi for the super over boys,1
"Although the Bangladeshi players aren't physically there, their spirit is very much present",2

Pooran and KL.,0
"What the fuck happened here. I left at 50/5 thinking DC has this in the bag.

I come back and see Mayank carried them through, scored were level, and left thinking KXIP took it away from them.

Now I see that it's somehow going for a super over",5
Lmao this whole match was so intense with lots of stuff happening better than all of DC and KXIPs 12 yrs,6

What no Maxi???,0
I switched off the tv after first 3 balls and switched back on at 19.5. Was 19.4 a wide?,3
Interesting.,1
Robbery,1
So what was it stoinis with the bat or stoinis final over or final ball no ball or short run?,1
Why the fuck did punjab chose pooran,6
Tf Umpiring standards lower than some Karen Bitch,0
Why would you not send mayank wtf,5
Quick somebody find out who's hit more boundaries,3
I have never seen two teams who wanted to lose so desperately.,5
IMHO batting seems difficult on these UAE pitches.,3
NO MAYANK???,3
Gentle reminder that poor umpiring is key ingredient of tied matches.,5
Mayank must be tired or else he should've def come on,6
Why not Mayank!? Too tired?,9
Only period of the year I miss not having enough friends to share this excitement,9
Mayank not batting lol,1
Y no Maxwell,2
It seems like Mayank is tired. Otherwise sending KL and Pooran is a mistake imo,8
Oh shit that incorrect short run was massive then,7
"I know that it's hard to believe, but before the tournament began I somehow felt sure that Mayank was gonna have a monster IPL season.",5
"Did mayank pass out or smt, pooran rly???",3
Where's Mayank,2
Chris Jordan had the worst game a cricketer can have,10
Rahul and Pooran?,3
DC celebrated super over as if they won the match.,2
"If they dont correct the short run, its all  fixed",5
"Who choked harder?

Julia Anne?
DC?
KXIP?",7
this will be a devestating loss to the team that loses. Might not recover.,5
"DC 19 boundaries

KXIP 18 boundaries


Just in case",17
no mayank no maxwell,3
That run short was reversed ?,1
"Such pathetic cricket from both teams in the last over, this is what brings us here. Super over time. Let's gooo boiisss.",7
It's rahoooool time,4
Surely you bring GLENN JAMES MAXWELL to play super over,10
"Even after that Short run 
It was 1 needed off 3 ffs",4
"Lovely scenes. White guy, black guy, brown guy all hugging each other.",15
"Stoinis looks like superman holy shit, I didn't even know it was possible to be that ripped",4
Is no one complaining about the short run?,3
Maxi should be ahead of Pooran there,1
To be honest that ball that Jordan got out was a bad ball. Just sheer badluck that it went straight into the hands.,1
They even got new graphics for the super over.,6
"5 Yorkers please, Idolo.",5
I switched to English commentary to find Gavaskar again,5
No Maxwell? Thanks KXIP,3
Super over overlay is sick,5
York him Rabada.,2
Neat super over scorecard overlay.,5
KKR 2008 theme for super overs,11
EWWWWWWWWWW SUPER OVER SCORECARD,7
Wtffff,3
Csk showed yesterday how to chase professionally,16
You know every year I hope to watch some genuine cricket and every year IPL never fails to disappoint with its scripted last few overs. Indian audiences need to wise up to this scripted movie style melodrama every year.,-20
Rip lmao,2
Why in the world is Mayank Agarwal not on strike,3
[deleted],2
Kg is fabulous in super overs,3
Not sure who's taking the decision to not send Maxwell there.,3
oh no,1
my friend is seriously arguing that Mayank got out intentionally because the match is fIXeD,10
None can win against Rabada in super over,4
Completely shat the bed,3
Fucking great bowling is that,5
Super over graphics are better then normal,4
What's with the short run? Missed it,3
Stoinis is a sexy bastard ESPECIALLY considering he's an Aussie.,2
Bc comment karte ho upvote bhi kardiya karo,3

Supremely retarded not to put out Mayank out there for the Super Over.,11
Mayank's efforts wasted 😔😔😔😔,8
Don’t forget Pooran literally scored 0 from 6 balls in super over against Narine a few years back in the cpl. He still hasn’t learned,79

Gayle or neesham definitely in for pooran,5

I should stop parroting them lol, boundary rule scrapped.",1
you cant defend three runs are the commentators on meth wtf. the only hope is to take two wickets smh,3
lol where is stoinis. where is agarwal. wtf is going on hahahahaahah,4
I think DC have it in them to make the super over interesting,5
"Man if they're gonna do Byju's classes straight after school, when are they gonna do other stuff?",5
Pisses me off that the commentators aren't mentioning the short run.,10
Wicket off the first ball would be amazing,3
Shitshow,2

Not opening with Maxwell and then not using Mayank is super over is peak KLPD captaincy,10
Pooran played a maiden super over against narine,4
Why does the match bot has a Lancashire flair,7
The umpire did them nasty,3
Lol Rahul,1
It will be tie again,2
There's a reason Mayank has replaced KL in tests,1
No way they gonna try to defend 2 runs. I mean how do you do that? It's just whatever happens happens.,6
This is not over yet with DC,2
I'm glad all KXIP players are smiling. Fuck this match lmao,6
Omg they sent Pant,2

"The commentators saying that the headlines tomorrow will be filled with ""Short-run"" have no idea who Kangana is.",11
It seems like Universe has been teasing KXIP throughout this match. Teases them with easy win and then takes it away.,3
Shami should try full tosses,1
Omg dc don't throw this one away,1
DC will fuck this up too. Will Score 1 and then get out.,2
should keep a slip,1
Pant is still trying to mess this up somehow,7
2 dot balls and Pant will slog,6
Did Pant just say LAWDA!?!?!,4

Heartbreaking for KXIP after Mayank's innings,7
What a weird game lol,13
And Pant used his head! We've seen everything in this game!,18
Warne’s dick will be like a dry lemon after this.,6
WORST SUPER OVER EVER,9
How are you an international bowler and still bowl leg side wides,2

Stoinis or mayank who's the player of the match.,1

What happened to Ashwin,6
Ganguly Mask Hacks,7
Never thought I'd be this disappointed by a superover.,11
Somebody in Delhi has managed to sacrifice a goat to satan to make this happen.,10
KXIP messed up by not sending Mayank,9
Not sending Mayank in the super over is some of the dumbest shit I've seen for while,30

We were #1 globally yesterday on r/popular while on 8k comments  but not today for some reason .,18

A super over... In the second match.,5
I started rewatching when KXIP needed 1 off 3 balls. DC fans thank me,12
This game was a roller coaster,2
Everyone's looking a tad bit chonky this season,18
Delhi being DELHi. Awesome start to IPl though.,9
Blue team wins in a super over where the opposite teams gets shafted by a horrible umpiring decision. I now know who wins this tournament.,12

Addendum: The short run was given for 18.3, but was registered by the commentator after this (18.5) ball",0
18.3 was given as 1 run and the last over had 13 runs required instead of 12. How was it corrected?,14
"[Asking with the comment section off, lmao](https://i.imgur.com/zGvhy9n.jpg)",13
[removed],28
What a cracker of a contest in which both terms tried their level best to lose,19
"For those who are claiming short run was corrected: 

> 18.6 Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run 
Low full toss outside off, gets down and taps it to extra cover to keep strike for the final over  

> 18.5 Rabada to Agarwal, 2 runs  
Just clears extra cover. Low full toss at off stump, backs away and looks to open the face. Barely gets it over...looks like it's a run short though even though they're back for the second. Addendum: The short run was given for 18.3, but was registered by the commentator after this ball

> 18.4 Rabada to Agarwal, FOUR runs  
Iyer drops it at deep midwicket! Short ball into the body, a tired aerial pull. Floated to Iyer's left and he has the reverse cups up and almost no balance as this digs into the turf and lifts over the line

> 18.3 Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run  
Another perfect yorker and he jams it down to long-on. Jordan quickly back for the second. Mayank on the fringes of his fitness right now, huffing and puffing.",12
I expect more clueless Yanks in the thread. Welcome to the world of cricket.,13
"For all those saying that ths short run was corrected,  they ran two on that ball (18.5)  . So if it was corrected it should have registered as 3",3

"If Stoinis can bat like this at 6 every couple of matches, it would really solve the last piece of puzzle for Delhi and would really help them in going all the way in this tournament.",26
Can't ignore the 300 SR innings by Nortje down the order. The guy has got potential to be a pinch hitter like no other. Compare that to Jordan's 83-ish SR at almost same situation and you have the difference between the 2 teams. U need to have an explosive tail for close matches like these.,33

What a match . It kept both teams on toes till the very end. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole punjab inning  fantastic batting from agarwal .  Pooran didn't helped at all . And bowling from rabada was just great . I just wanted punjab to win .guess we'll have to leave that for another day. looking forward to BENGULURU losing tomorrow 😂,13
"My man, gotta say that was one hell of a match. The way the tides were turning either side back-forth reminds me of why T20 is such an exciting format.",23
How can you lose when 1 is required from 3?!,40
Such a strange match. I still can't make sense of it.,21
Even RCB don't lose when they need 1 run off 3 balls. I mean the bowler is stoinis for ffs.,67
"Can someone please explain KXIP super over? Agarwal was pumped, he should face the first ball? Yet he doesn’t bat at all, and instead they play the guy with a duck to his name? I get pooran is a young talent and I like him immensely but seems strange to me.",37
