Mr Kohli I dont feel so good,23
I'm doing NNN challenge for RCB... Please do your bit for the unthinkable to happen and for RCB to clinch the IPL trophy.,5
Well a big Virat-AB partnership is due this IPL....just saying.,3
"What, it's evening already? My sleep schedule is fucked..",8
In before reverse jinxing by SRH fans lol,5
Rcb please defeat Srh- A Delhi fan,0
"I have no hopes and expectations but why am i tensed lol

Deep down there is still a smallll hope i guess",3
What is this strange feeling of anxiety I’m getting . Is it because my STD test is coming back tommrow? No it’s probably RCB playing a match.,3
"Honestly, is RCB up to any standard capable of beating MI in a final?",3
A minute of silence for those who lost NNN,2
"We SRH fans have made peace with the fact that we will lose this match. Virat looks very hungry for runs and we have enough experience how much he likes playing against us. But to all the SRH fans I think we can be proud of how our team bounced back after we lost not 1 not 2 but 3 first team players in bhuvi, marsh and 4d guru Mr.Shankar and qualifying for the playoffs even in this very very competitive season. All the best RCB hope you guys give Mumbai a good trashing.",26
"Honestly, as a Delhi fan, I would love to see them win but realistically the only teams which can beat MI is Srh and Rcb. Srh because it has a good team and Rcb because of potential individual performances from Abd/Kohli/Padikkal/Phillipe and Chahal or Sundar with bowling. Delhi neither has the team nor the individual superstars. For some reason batsmen are playing Nortje and Rabada much better now.",4
"Usually, I'd be pretty nervous, but I'm surprisingly calm this time. Feels like I know we're losing.",40
I have my final exam tomorrow and I'm tensed for this match more than it,4
I just want Koach and Warner in the same team hurling abuses at the umpires. 😌,9
Oh no we are gonna lose. Srh is gonna win. Oh no. Trouble lies ahead. We are fucked. We are gonna lose. Srh please spare us. Oh no,1
"From MI’s perspective, SRH getting knocked out would be better. But SRH is a hard team to root against and RCB is a hard team to root for.",2
"This is a tailor made situation for Kohli .

Under the pump , knockout  game .

He is going to come out all guns blazing and single handedly win this for RCB",2
"Play bold

The rcb motto. It's time to enforce this in the game. No one really expects us to win so might as well go all in. Fix the middle order and stop giving respect to spinners. Stop relying on abd and just go for it one last time",7
Last time kohli got a 50 against SRH was 2016 final.,7
What an anticlimax. I thought RCB and SRH fans would be at each other's throats in the comments section but what I see is reverse jinx vs reverse jinx by both fans.,19
Tonight's gonna be a legendary battle of reverse jinxing from both sides,3
"The KXIP choke must’ve really affected Warner, he’s brought it up in all of his last 3 press conferences lol.",10
"Before this ipl, I thought that we'll be last. So anything above that has been a bonus",6
"srh and rcb : finally a worthy opponent, our reverse jinxing battle wld be legendary",14
2020 is odd even leap year... for the folks who see patterns in stats...,5
"RCB have 100% record in eliminators. SRH have won an eliminator, lost an eliminator, and another; won a final, and lost a final since RCB last played an eliminator.",3
10:10PM I expect RCB rant thread. Until then I'll go make a BESCOM rant thread on blore sub coz no power all day 😒,3
"Whatever happens, I hope to see some 4D chess moves from Captain Kohli. This sub would make merry.",7
"The title should be ""let the jinxing begin""",3
Does anyone know if reddit is also giving out coins for free or just awards for you to hand out? Wanted to bet on this game,2
"Just go all in. Don't rely on dew™ every game, it hasn't worked and won't work. Fix that middle over batting and we can give a tough fight",3
"Generally, I believe in data but I've to say this time, stats have really messed up IPL, made people take weird decisions and made captain play some weird players in starting XI.",1
Whoever wins today will have the most number of eliminator wins in IPL. Joint with CSK and KKR at 2.,2
Is there grass cover on the pitch? Please tell me there is grass cover on the pitch.,3
"Why am i having a small hope, guys can anyone come and destroy it? I don't want to be disappointed again :'(",2
"Of RCB loses, of be REALLY disappointed",2
Inb/4 Natarajan misses game because nnn.,3
"One last time, just go all out(don't get all out). No tuk tuk nrr bs",3
I LOVE it when I see Brian Lara in the Dugout. He's one of the best,4
"For those who did not watch Kohli bday celebration video, Morris was unable to even walk. I wonder if it is a legitimate injury or he was just too drunk to even stand.",39
It's ironic Tirupati is located in united Andhra. Only ones to go govindaa goooovinda are the peeps in blore after every IPL.,5
Okay RCB friends it was us in 2016 and it will be you today... Hope you guys make it to final and be worth opponent to MI...,6
Should be easy for srh (no reverse jinx) since rcb have 2 injured bowlers. Rcb bench strength is so shit they have run out of their bowling options,2
Who will replace Morris if he is injured?  any idea?,1
This is going to be really embarrassing for us isn't it? Haven't been able to get any work done since morning.,2
"Come on Koach. Keep wickets with someone else. 

N allow AB to be superman on the field. Repeat that magical catch he took on boundary against SRH last season.",13
"Give a fight, don't just shit the bed against Rashid and i don't want to see another dreadful middle overs batting",2
Hello hello,5
"For some fellow RCB fans who still got hope, dont do that to yourself.",14
"Fuck if Moeen Ali replaces Morris, that would be dangerous for us... That guy hits sixes for fun..",6
"If morris and Saini aren't fit, what are the chances we can see Umesh anna,Siraj bhai, Steyn gun together?",2
"SRH won 3 matches on trot to win playoffs spot defeating top 3 teams, RCB's turn to defeat top 3 teams and win the cup.

ReverseJinx^^^^TM",15
[deleted],2
"Honestly RR had much better batting than us... Had they put in some thought to acquire all the extra Indian pacers whom we are just hoarding, they would have tipped us out of Playoffs...",8
"Win the toss, bowl first, win the game, ez pz (goes for both teams)",1
"I’ve noticed that despite RCBvSRH being such a fierce rivalry, the fans are always really nice to each other, unlike many other rivalries",88
Lmfao both teams fans reverse jinxing the other side,2
300 incoming,3
I don't see us defeating top 3 again in a row lol,-2
Seems like rcb already had their farewell party yesterday /s,46
The reverse jinxing going on xD,3
"So whoever wins today plays the final with mi

Ofc dc will continue their run of qualifier 2",1
So win the toss and it's game over for the opponent?,2
Do not disappoint me RCB,1
Every SRH YT video looks like it’s shot on an IMAX camera.,13
RCB lads cmon let’s celebrate our last IPL match today.,7
Fuck 4 duck team,3
"Time to implement 'inflate' strategy after 'deflating' for 4 matches in a row. For once, just for once, don't live up to your name RCB.",12
"All playoffs matches RCB won after 2011,AB was the MOTM. 

2015 eliminator n 2016 qualifier 1

All hopes on AB again",10
"As a Delhi fan living in Bangalore, i hope RCB wins. We have a better chance of beating them, and even if we lose, i hope RCB wins the title.",9
Eliminator is a more high stakes match compared to a Qualifier 1 imo,6
"Honestly I’m confused 

I have absolutely no idea who to support 

Every fan is reverse jinxing the other team",16
"This thread : You may have reverse jinxed us, but we will reverse jinx your reverse jinxing.",28
"<NO HOMO>

Kane looks graceful as fuck, in whatever he does

</NO HOMO>",64
Imagine working your ass off to reach playoffs only to face giant fucking RCB to get knocked out. Poor SRH.,14
I’m excited for RCB to choke one last time in this years IPL. Unfortunately I’ll have to wait next year for more choking,5
SRH had an extraordinary run of luck in the last three matches. Luck has got to turn now.,7
"Ngl, the vibes are scary , we play better when we are considered as underdogs.",10
Not a single RCB fan is reverse jinxing,1
What is deflate inflate strategy n where did it come from??  Programming?,0
"Just for RCB fans, who will you support after today's match-SRH,DC,MI",7
The team with Super V is gonna win.,2
"I don't know why people are so excited about SRH qualifying for the playoffs and possible ""title contenders"". We have lost as many as 3 eliminators in 8 editions of the IPL, and we have won one. You don't seriously expect them to win this one. They are going to butcher this and give RCB enough momentum to beat and knock out DC in the playoffs and then lose the final to MI as they'd usually do.",14
"So, Moeen for Morris and Finch for Phillipe?",3
Are Morris and Saini really out? Has this been confirmed or are all of you taking some random guy's word for it?,8
The Silicon Derby!,15
"My prediction is that RCB scores 450, bowls SRH out for 48 and then I wake up.",53
"Imagine if RCB loses , they will create a streak for 5 consecutive loses . Last time they lost their first 6 matches and this time their last five?(Hopefully not). Just RCB stuff",5
"Wait tf, reddit started showing ads in comments too? How greedy can this shitty company get",3
This thread is gonna read like two teens with a crush on each other but too insecure about their chances of success,33
"The bowlers for Srh are pretty consistent. I'd say that whether Srh wins or not depends a lot on Saha. If you let him stay beyond the power play, you are fucked.",5
"Wow, SRH and RCB fans both showing heights of reverse jinxing!  All the best Bois.",6
Want Umesh anna back today,3
Lmao SRH fans showing themselves up. Star sports showing 90% of RCB fans are positive on social media while only 75% of SRH fans are positive xD. We should be the most pessimistic fucks there are,11
Umesh is gonna take fifer today I can feel it.,6
RCB winning this I guess,4
Ian Bishop thinks the pitch is great for bowling and challenging for the batsmen. Hmmmmm,5
[deleted],7
Dunno whether to support RCB for the meme team represent or SRH because they’re doing the comeback which I expected from KXIP,2
Fuck you grammarly hahahahaha guess what I got underlined by red?,7
Don't know who to root for. I would like to face Rcb in the qualifier 2 but I loveeee Srh as a team.,2
"> Overall, it's going to be a challenging pitch for the batsmen, opines Ian Bishop, in his pitch report

Some relief... Roads as pitch are never favorable to SRH..",6
"Can rcb play the umesh, siraj, steyn dream combo in their last match this yr",6
"I am gonna have more faith in RCB's chances against SRH, than us. So RCB go for the kill, thanks",1
My body is ready for a siraj 4fer,4
"If RCB wins this, the next match will be : clash of the meme teams - III.",76
A combined team of 2016 RCB batting and 2018 SRH bowling is probably the most OP IPL team combination I can think of,6
"

Nobody:

Rohit & Pant: Match dekhte waqt Biryani serve karenge na?",12
"trying to reverse jinx RCB i jinxed my self, ive got a fever now fml",11
"Rcb's bowling this season is pretty underrated. 

They are just as good if not better than our's.",5
"After kohli n ab, who is the most famous RCBian?? 

Mr nags?",8
The rise of the sunrisers has a nice ring to it,1
Finch to come back in for Philippine and hit a 20 ball 100,4
"We will probably choke today but even if we somehow beat SRH and DC, MI will tear us apart in the finals",6
"Inb4 another 120/4 on the board

Ddp 30(32) koach 19(23) abd 35(25)",10
I wonder how much nags get paid,11
This year's RCB has to be the most fearful team of all time when in form in any sport,2
Women's t20 challenge has better team names than IPL,6
Will Sandeep  get koach again?,4
Who ever wins the toss should choose to bowl first. 🤔,3
"Last time I watched RCB bat (vs DC), I got a genuine migraine which led to my parents shouting at me for too much screentime. I feel like it was caused by the tuk-tuk though

Today I shall risk it again",5

Kohli would instruct everyone to bat with this pre-conceived notion that the pitch is slow and the SRH will blast them out of the park disregarding any pitch report.,8
"Kohli and knockout games, incoming 1(5)",6
is daddy morris bck,6
I think today RCB fans are dreaming a lot....you have to come to reality. Someone saying finch will hit 100 and other saying umesh will take a fifer. LOL,-8

RCB no matter what please don’t do middle-over tuk tuk again,4
Predict koach's post match interview,2
I have a feeling RCB is going to hammer SRH today. No amount of jinxing and reverse jinxing by SRH fans will work.,7
I have a strong feeling that we will win today,1
Why do I feel Rashid is going to leak runs.,3
"I have no hopes ,if they win I'll be happy,if they lose,just a normal day 

No loss ;(",2
I'll be supporting Delhi if SRH lose because hI have a soft spot for that abbreviation.,1
I srsly feel that we'll fuck this up because of ABD masterclass and then mumbai will easily win the finals by 100 runs/9wickets in the finals against RCB/DC,2
"As a DC fan, much rather face RCB than SRH on Sunday.  Delhi batsmen tend to lose their brains and gift their wickets to Rashid",2
Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man. -Friedrich Nietzsche,8
Honestly RCB should be handed the trophy for reaching the playoffs,7

"Hey guys I found IPL to be really profitable for betting so far. I have been asking Indian fans for advice and it's paying off, Australian odds don't really reflect accurately.  For this game im going to ask.

my money on RCB,2
"I'd love if Warner can make 140+ runs in next 2 matches and take that orange cap from KL.

"Toss plays a part yes, but for most teams it's just an excuse. You're batting first? Cool. Try and do what MI did yesterday or what SRH did versus DC.

"Bhuvi 

Marsh 

Saha 

Shankar  

The list just grows every match",10
No way RCB are winning today,3
"All jokes aside I really don't agree with bringing finch in for Philippe, smaller sample but Philippe looked way more comfortable at the crease then finch did while playing.",6
Finchy please turn it on today pls,0
Finchy please show up today🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,1
"Lmao, only 2 pace bowlers and both of them are braindead, great",4
"So SRH continued to battle on with injuries to key players.

But this time it might be a bridge to far to gap.",1
Moeen is actually playing,1
"SRH tamullu, don't start reverse jinxing",6
"Guys its probably gonna be another heartbreak, lets support each other and stay positive",2
Forget the IPL. Saha's injury is bad for the Australia Tour.,2
"Our chances of losing have increased exponentially , everyone playing well gets injured even if we somehow win this im sure rashid and warner will be injured by the next game",1
Koach after watching stoin yesterday: zampa boi,1
"Cricbuzz:

**Stat:** 11th toss won by Warner in IPL 2020. In eight-team editions, only Rohit Sharma in 2017 & MS Dhoni in 2018 has won as often. Not to mention, Rohit & Dhoni went to win the IPL in the respective seasons.",4
So Siraj at the death again? While defending? SHIT.,2
You all guys had enough of jinxing our SRH? See how you massacrred my Saha,3
"I am ok with today's changes.Dubey needed today atleast two overs from him.Moeen,Zampa,Sundar,Chahal that's one too many spinners though",0
"Shahbaz bowled well last time

Imagine giving a post match conference just to get dropped in the next game",0
I like RCB more than SRH as a team. But I'm rooting for SRH as it looks like the only team that can give a fight to MI,-3
RCB are winning this one looking at both the XI’s,4
Hello there downvoter. How was your therapy session today?,1
The fuck did they drop the kid for,1
Someone make an Injury XI with the players that have had injuries this season,1
"This RCB eleven looks better. It has both batting and bowling depth. If we win, next match replace Zampa with Morris.",2
Moeen Ali would've been a better replacement as he's an all-rounder our batting lineup is thin,1
"11th toss won by Warner in IPL 2020. In eight-team editions, only Rohit Sharma in 2017 & MS Dhoni in 2018 has won as often. Not to mention, Rohit & Dhoni went to win the IPL in the respective seasons.",1
We sacrifice our players to win the toss lmao,4
Dafuq! Cricbuzz shows that Moeen Ali is playing in for Udana. So we'll have only 2 pacers today!,4
Why Zampa instead of Udana?! Pace bowling looks paper thin.,5
Rcb defending makes it way tougher imo. Why do we keep losing tosses😭,6
Moeen Ali too in...,1
Mf does Warner ever lose a toss or not,2
We don’t have death bowlers again smh,6
"Playing moeen, chahal, sundar n zampa

Bowling second with dew coming in

Classic Koach decision",6
So siraj will bowl at death😢 and saini too is not in that great form,1
Wait? When did he say Moeen was in? I didn't listen,2
"If the match is decided early,do yourself a favour and watch The Gentlemen.",2
"**Virat Kohli** \- It could go both ways, we would have bowled first. But runs on the board could prove crucial. The last game opened up completely, when you haven't qualified, the nerves will come. It's an exciting time, it's been a leasure to play here.The seniors will have to take up responsibility, let the youngsters play freely. Chris Morris misses out with a quad injury, Joshua Phillipe is out as well. Aaron Finch is back, so is Adam Zampa. Saini replaces Shahbaz Ahmed and Moeen ali replaces udana",1
Finch has to perform today.  Please Finchy.,3
Hmm can you pls tell me the playing xi i am not watching it live rn or a way to know it?,0
"Our batting actually looks alright, the bowling concerns me the most rn",5
"Has ANY team ever in the history of IPL changed THREE overseas players heading into the playoffs?

Proves what a fucking mess RCB is tbh.",-2
"In t20s,

Goswami averages 27 with a SR of 116. 

Saha averages 25 with a SR of 130+. 

I believe Garg or Samad will open with Warner.",0
Fuck moeen ali is here,2
Another tuk tuk Innings from Pandey incoming.,1
RCB team is still not set smh,2
"Only two genuine pacers in RCB. Saini and Siraj, and not counting Dube. 4 spinning options in Chahal, Zampa, Sundar and Moeen.",3
Goswami needs to open,2
Zampa in 😮 STOINKS,4
"Which is Koach's favorite movie? 

Tinker Tailor Solidier Spy",2
RCB have picked 4 spinners. GG to them. Good luck bowling with the Kookaburra soap.,3
4 spinners for rcb. Are we at Abu Dhabi or chepauk ?,3
"I trust Kohli! If this is his XI, then I’m sure RCB will win",5
"11th toss won by Warner in IPL 2020. 

In eight-team editions, only Rohit Sharma in 2017 & MS Dhoni in 2018 has won as often.

*-Cricbuzz*",7
RCB pace bowling unit looks weak as fuck. We are losing the game boys.,2
"Who will bowl at death for us if it reaches there?? 

Lord siraj?",3
Okay moeen zampa finch ab,4
Who's gonna open for SRH now? Williamson?,5
"yall are playing adam zampa???? i only remember him playing in one match and that was when he took 7 wickets.... probably against us. FML

edit: 6 not 7",3
"RCB, it was nice supporting you this year. See you next year.",2
I think saha has been rested for the next big season.,2
Rcb looks balanced on paper. Don't you think?,1
koach gonna bowl today,2
LMAO fans of both team trying to play down their own expectations by saying their team will play like shit xD,2
"Saha also got injured just before playoffs last year, right?",3
"Lol Kohli forgot to mention Moeen in for Udana at toss and I was going nuts.
Four spinners, that might be too much.",2
"It's crazy how coincidental MI's IPL wins are:  
Won in Odd years  
Won while defending total all time  
Were top 2  
Won against Dhoni's teams  
Won in Hyderabad & Kolkata",2
Rcb made so many changes wtf,4
[deleted],1
I love us playing 4 spinners. If the pacers misfire(which they will) 10+14 overs of spin can make it tough for srh. Losing morris is bad though,5
"Team changes -

**SRH:** Goswami is in, Saha out due to injury

**RCB:** Saini, Finch, Zampa, Moeen in. Morris (injury), Shahbaz, Udana and Philippe out",5
"Virat 

Loses toss mostly and today probably forgot and didn't exactly tell that Moen is in

Everything that could go wrong with a simple toss did went wrong",2
"RCB: Nooooooooo we lost the toss. Our season is gone. Fuck our bad luck. Fuck you cricketing gods. 

Meanwhile SRH after losing Bhuvi, Mitch Marsh, Vijay Shankar and Saha:  OK",12
Finchy one last time boi,1
Virat may open,1
"At this injury rate, expect Muralitharan to play soon",61
"Should have kept Udana instead of Zampa, runs will keep leaking",1
Why zampa though ?  Udana was better.,2
WHY THE HEK ARE WE PLAYIN SO MANY SPINNERS,1
Lord Siraj masterclass in the death overs today,1
"Had to have udana today, our death bowling looks weaker without him",3
"4 changes for a playoff game. 14 games in, and you still don’t have a set XI. Top job RCB",11
No death bowling and no middle order again huh?,2
4 spinners in rcb. Either a masterstroke or a brainfade. What u think??,4
"BRÜH no Saha, not even reverse jinxing, we're fucked.",10
"14 games later we still dont know our perfect combination lmao

I love these fucking idiots",17
"Vs everyone else: Kohli

Vs Sandeep Sharma: Koli",6
"Fuck, Wriddhi is out?",1
"""RCB would have bowled first as well, says Kohli, but speaks of putting pressure with runs and early wickets in a match like this. ""

Basically everything MI did last night.",5
lmao why so many spinners,2
4 spinners in RCB. Yeah that’s the game lost right there,6
RCB really had a very good 11 to chase today.,2
"RCB, please win this match, it's my cake day ffs.",2
[https://gfycat.com/goldenperiodiccirriped](https://gfycat.com/goldenperiodiccirriped),1
RCB looking a lot like CSK at Chepauk with those 4 spinners lmao,6
"Who's going to bowl at the death?! In a chase that too. This team looks like it's been built for best case scenario in Chepauk. Bat deep, put runs on the board. Get wickets upfront with hopefully some swing and then choke SRH with spin. Washy Chahal Moeen and Zampa. Are you freaking kidding me?! 

Edit - Dew isnt a factor for these fuckheads apparently.",4
rcb : random changes bhenchod.,12
Agree with all the changes but has Zampa even played yet this season? Harsh to throw him in like this. Hoping He and Mo will set this alight!,1
only 2 quick bowlers. Could have played Udana or Umesh in Zampa's place. Not always necessary to play four foreigners. Would have given more balance.,2
Which Siraj will RCB get today? The one that nearly gets a hattrick and steams through the batting lineup or the one that gets hit for a hattrick of sixes?,8
How the hell can we always lose crucial toss man!,4
Godspeed to RCB is there is dew in the second innings,3
[deleted],1
Batting lineup going all guns blazing for rcb hope they don't fuck it up xD,3
What happened to Saha?,1
Guys as an Sri Lankan I am asking this do you think Udana felt brunt of Daniel Alexander today and not playing even after performing reasonably well ? 😞,4
">11th toss won by Warner in IPL 2020. In eight-team editions, only Rohit Sharma in 2017 & MS Dhoni in 2018 has won as often. Not to mention, Rohit & Dhoni went to win the IPL in the respective seasons.

Someone needs to tell Cricbuzz that correlation doesn't imply causation. What about the other seasons? Did the winning team win the most number of tosses that year too? The data is incomplete.",4
"No Saha today



My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined",12
Udana was anyways shit so that was a good replacement.,-4
"4 spinners when dew could be a factor....

Now I want rcb to score 250 just to see srh chase it down (warner 150 coming up)",4
"Moeen Ali, DDP, Finch, Virat, ABD and zampa, they were saving these dynamites for a revenge against us guys... Wellplayed!",5
[deleted],5
Has anyone seen gowswami play? Is he aggressive like Saha?,2
I think warner has been sacrificing our players to win all these tosses,45
Saha injured worries me guys,4
Manish Pandey salivating looking at the number of spinners we're playing today..,27
Why no Udana RCB?,4
Saini is gonna get taken to the shreds today,3
Mystery solved : zampa playing cuz stoinis played well yesterday.,10
If dew came then rcb will get fucked as spin is difficult in dew,6
Unrelated but this has got to be the best way to earn and lose comment karma lol,2
hope there is no dew..otherwise playing 4 spinners will back fire badly,6
[deleted],21
Saha injured we are fucked,5
Finch gotta start some fireworks today. It's a crucial match.,5
"Oh man, get warner cheaply and SRH's odds of winning decrease dramatically.  Saha was complimenting him very well",6
"Damn why so many changes for rcb, morris looked injured in their last match but why the other 3 changes.",2
"For RCB to win the IPL, they need to beat the three teams against them they have lost their last 3 games.

For SRH, they need to beat the three teams they have already defeated in the last week again",12
"No Morris and no Udana, RIP RCB's Death Bowling. Even 200 may not be a safe total for them.",6
"RIP our death bowling with Saini, Siraj and maybe spinners",2
Hope Koach has a plan otherwise srh is going to crush us,2
[removed],136
PLS RCB GIVE ME A REASON TO SMILE,4
[removed],3
Last ball encounter I feel.,2
"No Saha, I'm out. Bye. Congrats RCB.",9
"ah, missing the games played at c'swamy where VK and ABD smashed the opposition and a sea of red flag made waves in the stands. then the opposition batted, smashed them hard and won in the final over and bangalore uncles and aunts had their palms on their lips. some dumb teenagers had tears in their eyes. and mallya sir looked as drunk and smug as ever.",1
"Kohli has to open man. As good as DDP has been, his 50(40) do more damage than good",1
"Mr. Kohli, are you kidding me? You dropped Shabhaz, who saved your faces from getting eliminated  by bowling well in the last game and you drop him? Philippe had one bad game and you drop him? Why do you need to play with 4 foreign players when you can play with better indian players in their place. This is why many people shit on Kohli",1
"Only Saini and Siraj for death bowling? Uh oh, but good news for us",1
Wtf now Saha is injured... We're truly having a shit year in terms of injuries,4
"Big loss in Saha, don't know how dependable Goswami can be",3
We lost 5 games batting first,3
What no saha ?,2
"After all these changes and bullshit, RCB in the end in crucial match is left in the hands of Indian fast bowlers!!

I feel for RCB fans!!",3
Sandeep to tease finch with 3 out swingers only to bowl him through gate by an in swinger,4
"This looks like a nice lineup. Nice depth and experience in batting, lots of spin options.
Looks like Siraj might get to bowl in the PP and hopefully he'll make a good use of it",1
"Siraj and Saini in Death overs, Mike Hesson has lost it 😭😂😭😂😭",2
"All RCB needed was Parthiv or virat opening the batting instead of Joshua and Moeen Ali in the middle order, instead they completely shuffled their team as if it's a practice match.",2
r/chonkers represent Finchy please fuck them up🙏,2
Rcb have lost their last 5 matches while batting first. See y'all next season,6
4 spinner for rcb damn,1
Supporting Moeen Ali today,9
"Ok whoever wins this, i will be rooting them for the rest of ipl,  but i am more towards rcb than hyderabad",2
"As a neutral, its amusing to see both sides absolutely shitting themselves about the injuries and changes on either side.",8
If it’s anything above 150 we gonna crumble under pressure,3
"Guys complaining about only 2 pacers should chill. Washington gonna bowl 3 overs in PP, Zampa and Chahal in the middle overs to hopefully slow the match down.",1
"Why why why! Saha Out and Goswami In

We've already lost this!
I'm gonna attract the wrath of Kanos Simps, but he isn't been performing lately. Our batting order is solely on Davey today.",6
The changes made are a huge gamble and RCB dont have high chances of winning gambles. ;-;,4
I dont want to be that guy but there's one Englishman and one Kiwi playing against each other and it's a knock out,5
What happened with the whole Moeen confusion?,2
Saha out. I’m done. We’re fucked. Congrats RCB. Our team balance is fucked.,7
"4 spinners seems a bit of a gamble here from Kohli, looks like they were relying on winning the toss, definitely gonna be difficult later on in the evening if there’s dew",6
"Soon as the pundits started advocating for Saha's inclusion in the Indian team, he misses a game due to an ""injury"".

Script writers aren't being that creative this time are they?",2
Srh already reverse jinxing.,1

Fuck this reverse jinxing bullshit this is playoff it doesn't work here,14
Goswami has an average of 16 and strike rate of 100 in ipl... Gg rcb,6
even if we defeat rcb today and DC later we aint doing anythinn against mi without saha,8
"Rumours are Chahal gonna be bowling in death alongside Saini. Sundar,Zampa and Moen in middle overs. The absolute scenes ❤️",3
Saha is SRH’s lucky charm. RCB might have a chance to win tonight !,4
IDK why but I am sensing an Adam Zampa special tonight.,6
Both sides fans think their team selection is fucked,5

"flash back 2016 when kohli used to open

they got finch , moeen in hoping it will work",1
"So if DDP is out, does Moeen come in ?",1
Damn koach straight up against sandeep,4
ITS HAPPENING EVERYBODY STAY CALM ITS HAPPENING KOHLI IS OPENING,6
Inb4 Sandeep Sharma gets koach's wicket.,2
Sandeep salivating rn seeing Kohli in,1
Kohli opening huh?,2
"Kohli is either gonna go on a rampage or get out quickly, no 40(35) today surely",5
I came just to see subreddit meltdown,2
I have a bad feeling about Virat opening...,5
"Koach opening:- Panik


Which means Sandeep will bowl him 3 overs:- Kalm",5
Will there be dugout in India Vs Australia?,2
Hoping for an RCB win. Fingers crossed 🤞.,2
"BRUH, pls work. Whatever the plan is, pls work.",5
0/3,1
Koach opening...what weve been asking for!,1
Well atleast it's a bold strategy.,1
Let’s go Koach opening!,2
VK likes to hit boundaries in the beginning. The PP restrictions may just allow him.,4
"Press F, to my biriyani boys. Koach gonna fuck us up. He averages 70 while opening. I don't want him to slaughter our bowlers. Hope we don't be his victims",3
Sandeep vs Koach. Scenes if he nabs him in the 1st over.,1
Kohli bringing in the energy rcb needs,3
LETS GO BOYS,3
"200 incoming,you heard it here",3
225 please Koach,4
Happy to see Kohli opening. Hopefully he makes it count,3
Angry Koach coming out with an intent. Good night Bois.,5
I have never been so excited for a teams line up. This is big dick energy from RCB. 220 incoming,5
Koach is a likely bowler today. *Pictures of Albie Morkel flashing in rapid succession* :-(,6
Mi dropped finch after a few bad games and they went on to win the ipl(2015). Rcb picked finch after so many terrible innings.,3
RCB has made so many major changes I'm legit afraid this might actually work.,4
Kohli Opening this is a delight,2
Kohli [visits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jp1p8z/why_doesnt_virat_open_the_innings_in_ipl/) this sub confirmed?,3
Watching Kohli open does put a smile on my face,4
"Just hoping Finch n Kohli come in overdrive mood from yesterday's party n smash everything here

If not My boi Ab wud have to do it himself once again",3
Kohli opening. YAAASS,2
"**Conspiracy Theory**



DDP is invented by RCB to win at least the *Emerging Player Award*",5
"BHENCHOD WHY DOES KOHLI HAVE TO OPEN NOW OF ALL MATCHES , WE ARE DOOMED",11
Virat against beast Sandy,4
"*warner wondering how to use Sandeep Sharma effectively*

Kohli: Hold my protein bar",9
Bret Lee is sad to see Kohli open instead of Finch and Phillieppe 😂😭😂😭,5
Kohli got that bday energy from last night,5
"Given there is going to be dew ,RCB should score extra 30 runs.",3
I am scared of Koach The 948 opener,6
"You Fucking blind followers of RCB can downvote me as much as you want, but as a passionate fan who always wants the best for RCB, I'm undeterred in my opinion that the management shouldn't have dropped Phillipen",7
"Should have went with Kohli as opener, long ago when Finch was failing.",9
No slip?,3
"Wow, Kohli opening. Bold move to experiment in playoffs",7
Kohli vs Sandeep,6
"After seeing the worst possible opening from DC last night, even RCB opens bad, it's gonna feel normal.",4
Kohli : Fine I will do it myself,51
RCB have lost their last 5 games batting first !,5
"If Kohli was to open then why bother with Finch, should have replaced Finch with Udana",3
These SRH fuckers aren't stopping reverse jinxing,6
We gonna win it aren't we,3
"Saha, Morris, Udana, Philippe out!? Did both the teams go to the same restaurant and get collective food poisoning?",6
RCB one of the rare teams whose Indian players are settled but foreign players are not settled.,10
"Take out Warner, Williamson and Rashid, SRH is shit.
Take out Kohli and AB, RCB is double shit.",10
Harsha Bhogle is an antidote to Gawaskar chutiyapa.,10
Finch in the middle order is a big brain move. No swing when the ball is old,13
"So, Kohli is gonna misfire today and get out in the first over?",3
Why is Saha not playing again?,-2
Not a single ball bowled and 1200 comments. Nice.,12
"Koach actually listening and opening himself? 
:poggers:",8
Srh is fucked. They don't have Saha.,7
Kohli on strike...and I'm freaking nervous,6
When kohli came to bat i felt like king kohli is walking idk you all this could be diff,6
Padikkal thinks - shit. I have to run like crazy from first ball. I used to have a cushion until Koach came,3
Paddikal running out of stamina in powerplay,2
"Would like to see big scores today, RCB has not succeeded in getting that one innings of Kohli-AB masterclass",3
"This is actually good, problem which is plaguing Delhi too. Optimising your Batting lineup. Kohli at top is good cos then Finchy gets flexibility to go guns blazing at middle. Solves their slow runs at the middle also",6
Calling it now Koach century,4
Pls don’t get out to sandeep again koach,3
Can we win tonight?,2
Both are tuk tuk players,2
Lol Finch has to play against Rashid,2
Now AB 1down please,5
Kohli 100,3
One good thing about Koach opening: it’s either 12(20) or 92(50),9
"As happy as I am that Mos playing, he has been relatively shit for quite a while so it’s a bold call in a play off...

Anyway, past is the past, 40 ball century today Mo.",8
Kohli opening. Get fucked SRH.,4
"Expert advice play out Sharma and Rashid overs.

bc phir overs bache kitne?",6
YRKFA already showing the spark,2
"Kohli opening against Sandeep is him saying ""Come one give me your best shot."" Koach Rocky Balboa.",9
is parthiv patel part of the support staff,3
The best chance for SRH is if they restrict RCB to less than 150. With no Saha and no YJB I don't see them chasing anything big today,11
"Just tuned in, why is Saha not playing?",3
So Saha is injured?,4
"I just noticed, RCB's whole team balance is different. They have way more batsman and a ton of spinners.

If nothing else certainly has the element of surprise.",5
Virat Kilo leading from front. Better smash a century today. I have worthless reddit coins riding on him XD.,12
"Rashid is such a flashy fielder, great for the game",8
"Kohli comes in knowing fully he is Sandeep's bunny

What a fucking man",39
Kohli will get out sub 20 for sure,4
[deleted],9
"RCB follows the same team selection template as Team India (RTG^TM ,invented by Kohli himself). Interesting.",8
"Imagine if SRH had B Kumar as well in this team, him and Sandeep would be pretty amazing",5
Bhenchod gaand fati padi hai — Koach opening. 🥺,4
"Finch is good with spinners 

DDP will score 30(20) in poweplay , kohli will get easily settled then kohli and finch would smash rashid all over the ground and ABD will hit a 19 ball 50 because of natarajan trying to ball yorkers but ending up bowling full tosses on his pads 

We'll lose by around 30-50 runs minimum :(",7
I am thinking so many changes for a knockout not going to work in RCBs favour,1
stop jinxing VK ffs,1
Oh shit. Paddikal gonna get exhausted before the powerplay lmao,11
Morris is injured??,3
SRah batting looks paper thin today.,1
"And as the ultimate 6D move, Chahal will walk in at #3.",2
"If RCB advance and Zampa performs well, we might see Zampa Vs Stoin in Q2",2
"I JUST JOINED AND KOACH IS OPENING FUCK.

&#x200B;

RCB still gonna lose but my heart rate for a second ooof.",1
Wtf happened to Saha?,1
"We might be the only fanbase who is nervous, even when the world's best batsman is on strike. And I don't blame you.",7
"7 wins and the best one for me was the one against CSK when Garg and Abhishek stepped up to the pressure. Young Indian players won the game for SRH for the first time in forever. Hopefully we see some true talent from
Samad today.",0
[deleted],3
Kohli gonna murder DDP before the 4th over with that runninv,3
Why isn't wk coming forward?,1
Why exactly is this fat guy (in the Dream11 ad with DK) moaning sexually while playing on the chair?,4
34-0 powerplay incoming before they loose wickets in heap with run rate pressure,2
"without saha, i'm nervous for srh's chances today",0
Why in the world is saha out of squad,2
SRH for the win👍,3
"Koach opened because he wants to tire out DDP early and get him out sooner so that AB can come early at one down.
200 IQ",4
Rumour has it that Zampa's killer dance moves earned him the XI spot XD,12
Why is philippe out?,3
Pray for Paddikal stamina,2
These 2s will kill ddp,2
The batting not ending after ABD suddenly makes RCB look much more threatening.,0
Interesting they didn't use Bairstow because Saha is injured. Guess they value holder/kanos more then YJB,1
Kohli is looking more confident today than the previous games,0
Kohli is gonna tire DDP out,0
"Story of Saha's career. When we all think he is irreplaceable, he gets injured :(",1
DDP will be tired by the end of PP at this rate,2
Butt status - Clenched,1
Kohli might get padikal tired broooo,0
Padikkal is gonna get tired by 6th over tonight 😂,2
Going to be a lot of running for poor DDP,1
(S+K) aha,2
Kohli gonna get runs by doubles in powerplay,0
KOACH OUT!,0
Shit,0
WOW,0
Didn't someone make a thread or comment asking why Virat isn't opening? That aged well,0
Inb4 Holder does a pollard in the second innings and wins it for Srh,0
Fucking praying 2016 Kohli has walked out today,1
Fuck,1
"Gone , the beast is gone. Woooow. Yeees",1
lol,1
Kohllapse begins,5
RIP RCB,3
People saying kohli shouldn't open because Sandeep has got him out a lot of times don't know him at all. Just ask Anderson.,7
Kohli is literally on 6* (6) rn and I saw a comment saying '2016 Kohli is back',16
RIP RCB RIP Koach,3
What the actual fuck,6
Aree boundaries bhi maarne hote hai pp me bc,6
I hope Padikkal doesn't gas out.,4
RIP KOACH,6

Eliminators and Koach smh,2

Man kohli was looking good. Getting caught done leg side bruh.,2
Fuck,2

Do you guys think koach will bust out his right hand quick bowling today?,1
Nortje and Holder. Turning out to be Super Replacements,2
That was quick (not talking about Holder's pace) :),3
I’m done lmfao,2
Gg lads.,0
Shit I forgot about Holder,3
Sad trombone noises,3
Kohli & shitting the bed in knockout games. Script seems to be on point so far.,10
Koach living up to the playoff expectations,4
I wanted Kohli to score so bad man,5
Next sala ....,8
"Kohli 🤝 Rohit

     Bad performances in knock outs",17
"Katich: You can’t lose your wicket to Sandeep again

Koach: Dear holder, take my life",6
Well it was expected just didn't this soon,0
Kohlol :(,1
"Yep, plan for Sandeep, get fucked by Holder.",0
Hahahahahhahahahahhahaha aaqaahhhbha ababhabaha bbahahah,5
"GG bois, it was fun while it lasted..",5
"Bad wicket to take for SRH, should've taken him on 30 of 30.",4
Damn good job Jason,5
*Suryakumar Yadav laughing in the distance*,13
What a catch under pressure playing your first match of the tournament.,5
Kohli prepared for sandeep. Holder came out of syllabus,7
Kholi and low scores in big games continue,12
Damn it Koach,5
F,2
Just need AB's wicket now. ❤️❤️,6
That's the Windian luck we talked about,5
"**1.2** Holder to Kohli, OUT, **appeal for catch behind and it's given!** Kohli is taken down leg side by Goswami. **7-1**

V Kohli c &dagger;Goswami b Holder 6 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 85.71",5
Fuck ass,3
Just opened this thread and I can already see the SRH fans jinxing hard,2
Seen Kohli get out down the leg side in crunch matches a few times now,3
It’s fine it’s Finch’s day today,2
West Indies skip gets Indian skip,6
Aaron Finch opening after all,9
"There's always next year, RCB",4
Calling a <160,5
Bday boy taking out bday boy (bday was yesterday),10
Jason Holder is the gentle giant,10
Come on we already knew that RCB is playing with 10 players today,2
You can take the opening batsman out of Finch but not Finch out of the opening batsmen,5
Srh GG,2
 Where the hundred lmao,2
Now watch every commentator cry this happened because Kohli was batting out of position and he would've scored a 120(69) today if he were at his regular number 3.,5
"This is basically finch opening, fucking useless.",3
"Okay boys! I'm glad we made it so far with this team.
We ll come back stronger in 2021",5
Kohli is shit in crucial games,7
Typical Kohli not performing in knockout games,6
"Strangled down leg!!

Bwahahaha 


Koach is cursed.",5
Lode lag gye,4
Well I guess finch and paddikal are opening again,10
RIP will see everyone again next year.,5
F,3
Prepared for Sandeep but Holder out of syllabus,10
Thought Kohli was opening?,4
Cmon Finchy boi,2
Kohlapse,7
"
Kolhi Maderchod firse hagg dia knockout mein 

T: Same old Kohli , shitting the bed in Knockouts.",7
That was a dumb way for Krabby kohli to get out.,3
Kohli should just retire tbh,-4
Finch would have stayed longer !!,2
ok ok... fine... next please. :((,4
"Well,that was disappointing",2
Kohli is not the best batsman in the world lol.,1
This upgrad ad is the worst imo,2
At least there won't be tuk tuk,2
gg boys see you next season,4
"Can't believe Holder, being a senior player, would do Sandeep dirty by picking Kohli's wicket.",9
Finchy - doesn't matter. Lol,4
I would not be surprised if they straight up showed porn on that josh app,8
Holder stealing Sandy's thunder,4
Kohli has been so dog shit this season. Had maybe 3 good games,7
Just kill me. Just hurry up and do it.,9
Something something syllabus kohli Sandeep Holder.,5
SRH really loves wicket keepers from Bengal.,6
"This is a flash in the pan, Finch will murder us",7
*Agle saala cup Naamde*,11
Koach and crunch games.. sigh,13
Didn't look like any bat or glove? But I guess it was,3
And DDP breathes a sigh of relief.,11
"Lmfao who was that asshole saying Kohli should open the batting?

Fucking newbies on this reddit I tell you.",5
Padikkal : bless my legs,7
You should not experiment so much in crucial matches.   Lesson learned or may be not.,3
"So Finch and Padikkal technically opening, yeah it's all good, no issues.",8
Kohli and getting out early and not doing shit in important knock out games. I've seen this episode before,7
Fine Finchy you can open geez,13
Holder : I am the Sandeep now.,75
Happy birthday Kohli,9
"VK: I will open today
Finch: Oh. Anyway.",23
I miss peak Kohli,20
Unlucky dismissal tbh,8
r/cricket jinxed it,9
Never expected such a soft dismissal from Kohli,5
See you next year guys!,7
"I had no expectations but I'm fucking gutted now

Fuck you koach",10
Kohli RTG strikes again,1
The rumors of kohli being from south Africa was really true. No wonder he likes ABD,6
Aaron finch looks like Matt Damon,2
"Ivattu RCB hoge


Translation: RCB is screwed today.",8
Finch 150*(69),6
"Guys calm down , we dont have saha you never know when pandey ji decides to bless us with his 50 SR masterclass",9
That was a typical Khaleel wicket.,4
honestly kohli has been pretty shit this season apart from that 90,10
Finch repeat Qualifier 2 2016 pls,9
I was naive enough for expecting Kohli to score 70+ here. F.,2
"Perfect Cameron Bancroft impression from Kohli, 6(7) then caught down the leg side.",2
Ee sala dukh kahe nhi khatam hota be,9
One b'day boy got another's wicket,5
I don't mind this move of Kohli opening better than sucking out momentum in middle,4
Kohli's post 2016 IPLs have been so meh.,10
RCB didn't expect holder to come up with his huge 👌 lol,3
"Well... Gg SRH, you better win the title as well",3
"At this rate of his beard, Kane will become Jesus by Christmas",10
Finch can’t play his natural game now. Or will he?,3
Guys we have good bowlers against aus but all our batmens are out of form wtf do we do,2
When was the last time Kohli performed in a knockout game? IND vs Wi 2016 ICC WT20 semifinals.,15
My dad is *so* mad at Kohli right now lmao,39
Sad boi Kohli,2
Holder trying more wides to see if others nick it too lol,5
Koach knows it over. 😂,5
Aah back to RCB making the pitch look like a minefield only for team batting second to walk it.,4
We were 20/30 runs short incoming,7
Fucking choker,0
"K for Kohli

K for knockout game.",4
"Still a far better start then Delhi, i cant even",4
RCB is used to Kohli not performing this season. Don't think they will be disheartened... Yet,3
"Why in the fuck would Kohli do these dumb changes in knockout matches? 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

FINCH IS A FUCKING OPENER FOR AUSTRALIA! Hehas played almost all games this season as an opener, he has played and won World Cups, he captains Australia, he CAN OPEN THE INNINGS.

WHYYYYYYY in the hell would you change shit up in a knockout game?",-2
Rohit and Kohli both out cheaply in an eliminator...,8
Finch basically opening anyway.,5
What happened to Saha,2
Like Scottie Pippen once said Kohli doesn't have that clutch gene,9
I just hope Kohli is back against Aus atleast.,6
RCB looking to play for NRR,0
Kholi should move up to number 4 instead.,7
Ohhh that's close. Ufffff,1
Kolhi is past his prime. Best for him to retire now.,-5
Indian players need Ponting and Gilchrist energy in knockouts,5
"Lmao name a more iconic duo

SRH and goat bowling",5
"How many Indian capped batsmen actually perform in knockouts? No Rohit, no VK. Shikhar?",1
save us devdutt with a 50(47),5
Srh good luck for the qualifier 2,6
Finch what are doing lmao,2
[deleted],4
Something always goes wrong with RCB when they make the right decisions.,7
I hope Finch performs well under pressure today,3
I wanted Sharma to pick up Kohli’s wicket but his wicket is always a gift.,3
"RCB can’t beat MI with their shaky batting this year. SRH might, so backing SRH today but RCB winning will also be 🔥",2
I went to grab a snack and suddenly Kohli is no more. What happened?,2
Why the fuck RCB fans are disappointed? Koach hasn't contributed this season. They should feel the same way we feel about Vada Pav.,8
Ugly shot,3
"Finch looking clueless lol

Good bye bois",15
Kohli gonna Kohli. Philipe was looking so good. That too for a guy who was asked to start playing randomly. He changed the order by opening himself. Dropping Philippe. Getting back in out of form Finch. This man’s tactical goof ups have been a big reason India haven’t won a major trophy in the last 5 years or so despite such a great team at our disposal.,10
"Last time koachli scored 500+ in a season, wickets were flat af. Coincidence? I think not",4
calm down finchy,6
Finchy is fidgety,3
"Just don't collapse, RCB, if they chase it , fine let it be, but don't collapse",5
"Wait so our biggest threat to scoring big is gone

That's good right?",5
"When I saw 7/1 I was like, oh well, at least I'll get to see Kohli bat. 

And then I checked who got out. 

Fucking Koach.",27
Nehraji saying gend out hone wali nahi thi lmao,11
"Finch is nervous and confused,  please put him out of his misery",8
What's point of not playing Finch as opener if he is gonna come at no 3 anyways? Either play him as opener or down at 5.,9
So much for the opening suspense;),4
"Kohli continues sucking at tournament knockout stages, one of the big reasons why he fails to win the tournament after playing really well.",11
Finch looks lost,7
The ploy to prevent Finch from the new ball has backfired big time,6
When did Holder become this good?,4
Finch is gonna play a blinder today. Heard it here first.,5
Watch finchy dance around the crease and get out cheaply again,4
"Now you guys have abd and finch for the middle overs so your only weakness has been removed , masterstroke by koach",11
Kohli is a great captain when he's not trying to be radical with his changes.,6
"Should set up a silly point and a short leg for Aaron Finch and keep at it. He'll pop a catch soon, the way he's going.",1
"When you already have low expectations, the current scorecard is not surprising.",4
Koach shouldn't have opened today after not doing it for the whole season. You're in a unfamiliar territory.,4
"These annoying Bravo academy bowlers like Holder. Slow, loopy, no seam.",-1
"holder has been awesome for SRH, long levers",2
Finch holds the biggest key to RCB tonight. He can be a big game player and it's a do or die situation.,2
Kohli and the management are so fucking retarded. Why finch in suddenly. And now he's basically opening again.,5
Finch standing outside the crease. RCB 200 incomong,2
Please drop Koach as the captain. How many times does Brohit need to fuck him in the ass for selectors to see his potential,8
Chad Meat Eater 2016 Koach vs Soy Boy 2020 Kholi,30
I am gonna delete my account if RCB make it to finals.,12
Gavaskar is really jealous of tall people... I wonder why,14
Sandeep + Holder is actually a great combo,3
Finchy also looking rusty. Just hope AB does an AB again.,5
"Damn, Finch already looks like a walking wicket.",3
how tf doed Finch keep getting picked for Australia and RCB,0
I guess Finch and Padikkal will be relieved with Kohli gone. They will now play and dots and no need for the 2's. Lmoa,8
STOP THE ~~COUNTS~~ Wickets,8
"Holder is the peak allrounder right now. Bats, bowls and captains brilliantly. Has made his team punch way above its weight.",4
"Pls Rcb pls. We all have waited for so many seasons, don’t make us wait another one",7
"Why is Finch back, Philippe & Padikkal were so good as openers.",3
I swear if Finch does a Watson 2018 today,6
Why did they bring in finch? Who creates this myth of Australian players suddenly playing good in the playoffs? He's clearly struggled all season and hes struggling even now.,2
Jetlagged AF but glad to be able to watch the match at 7pm instead of 10 am in the morning,7
See you next season until there's an AB masterclass,11
To think holder isn’t even in the t20 West Indies team,2
"Nice guy Kohli didn't want Finch to feel uncomfortable batting out of position,so he got out quickly",8
"Finch looking shaky, should have stuck with Phillipe",2
Still foot movement from  finch. Goood,2
Someone please hit finch in the Dick,7
Kya slow khel rahe hain yaar,2
Come on Sandeep bowl a good inswinger and get finch.,0
"Finich reminds me of Shane watson in lean patches, struggles few matches on initially in important matches and boom, finds the form of life and goes on to crush bowling team",8
Who's the WK for SRH today?,1
Hit out or get out ffs,3
looks like SRH v MI finals confirmed lads,2
"RCB to Finch - ""We have an impostor among us""",2
Kohli has been horrible this season. I don't care what position he is in the orange cap list. And don't ask me if I average 50+ across formats,15
DC vs SRH gonna be an absolute cracker,1
Finch and sandeep Sharma goddaammmnn,3
Finch's body language looks good though.,3
Wait why is Wriddhiman Saha not playing????,3
Where is the RCB Fans Emotional Support thread?,8
Expecting Finch to regain his good form in 2 weeks while playing against India,110
"IPL has been dull since the double super over weekend. Come on guys, give us a thrilling match",9
Keeper standing up for Sandeep. Great move.,1
Hyderabad never gave reasons they just performed ....no injury reason nothing just pure talent,1
Moeen beard is just so epic.,2
Is downvoter back?,4
finch is a walking wicket,-1
All hopes on Abd now,2
RCB are 1-2 spinner short. Only 4 playing today.,1
"Sorry to butt in politics but this is too funny to pass on 😆😆😆


https://twitter.com/AnandWrites/status/1324713583280869377?s=19",-3
Why the fuck would you make four changes and shuffle batting positions in a knockout game?,3
"Pretty unlucky dismissal tbh, and people are going at it like he nicked a wide one outside off.",6
I don’t understand why drop Phillipe for Finch. Philippe gave you 20-30 runs easy.,10
I feel like rcb just made random changes to the lineup and hoped something would click,2
Anyone have a stream?,2
I am worried about Kohli's form for Aus tour,4
😭😭😭😭😭 WHY KOHLI WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY,2
Hope Koach will be back in the Australia tour.,5
"There are going to be a lot of comments trashing him but I feel for Kohli. He's out of form and his usual fallback method of turning over strike isn't working. 

Hope he regains his original touch in the Australian tour; India need him at his best in Tests and ODIs. Those practice games and ODIs are going to be crucial personally for him.",8

Also me: worrying about his form going into aus tour",8
This is looking like <160 for RCB,2
Tell me Phillipe was injured and that's why they dropped him.,1
I expected something different today.,0
I am more worried that our 3 and 4's are completely out of form.,3
0 boundaries yet btw,3
Mumbai Indians doesn't defend.  DC and RCB player defends and gets out like shit,9
"As much as I like seeing Kohli struggle in international matches (particularly against us), it pains me to see him playing like this in the IPL. That 2016 season was something else and it would be fantastic to see him get into that type of form again, as long as its not when we come over in 2021 :)",8
Tuk tuk,2
doesnt look like power play !!,1
Attack is the best form of defence,3
Louda already ensuring a 120 target... Play bold idiots,3
RCB PP smol,8
Lol dropping your only aggressive batsman in top 3 for finch is such a brain dead move,1
Boys whats going on with kohli this ipl. He seems so out of form this year,8
Glad Sandeep doesn't have any ego about the keeper standing up front,4

Great over from Sandeep.,1
"This is why it’s so much more difficult for RCB to win titles than other teams even of they’ve a strong team. Picking Finch over Philippe is such a brain dead move, we would accuse them of match-fixing if we didn’t about their retarded-ness.",1

But the only difference is, our bowling is shit while SRH arguably have the 2nd best bowling line-up in the league. So we're neither a batting team nor a bowling team. Fuck this shit!",2
Hoping Australian plays well in big match,2
"Sandeep is so underrated. His numbers are as good as Bumrah. Not comparing the two, they have diff roles. But deserved a place in the side instead of Khaleel",1
Can’t hit in PP coz Sandeep and Holder. Can’t hit in middle coz Rashid. Can’t hit at death coz no batsman.,11
Before NZ series Kohli said He's overworked and he failed In NZ. He got 6 months of rest and came back in IPL and has looked very ordinary now he's saying this bio-secure cricket is mentally fatiguing and you can see it 😞 .,7

Holder OP,6
It's time to admit that Kohli's been in decline for a while now. And it's not looking pretty. He needs to make way for young talent in the T20I squad. His favouritism and vendetta has already deprived the team of  good talent despite their performance in the local circuit.,4

I guess being disappointed at Kohli getting out early at number 1 is better than being disappointed at him getting out early at number 4,4
I've said this before but I honestly can't figure out what happens to kohli and Rohit in the ipl. Its not like they don't care. It baffles as to why they play like such donkey's,3
I knew this would happen but still I'm disappointed,5

Just one or two wickets upfront and it's game over for Srh when they're batting. Even Shankar is not there. Honestly, even Mumbai would be underdogs if bhuvi, Shankar and Saha were there.",1

holder has got 2 wickets,3
"I will say rcb have the best jerseys, rebranded the look from the first few years of red/gold/?blue? to red/black.

Wish srh could rebrand the looks, black with orange trim maybe, ad the current look is horrid like deccan from ipl where it was cream and black. Ipl2 they can with that nice blue.",3
P Garg is a great fielder,1
I'm an RCB fan only when ABD walks in to bat,7
Until we get De Villiers I will not celebrate other wickets.,3
"Why would you play with 3 spinners(2 of them wrist spinners as well) and just 2 seamers when Dew is gonna be big factor . That’s after playing 4 seamers all through the group stage.

Did Kohli bank everything on winning the toss",1

Get everyone boys. Spare no one. Let's tighten the noose.,7
10D chess from RCB to lose two wickets early so that AB comes in the powerplay and forces Warner to bowl Rashid early.,11
"I blame the yatch party RCB had for kohli's birthday yesterday, half the squad is drunk the other half is stoned, finch is high on vaping so much",7
ABD in Power Play?! BIG OOOF,8
Kohli cannot win a toss to save his life jesus,5
Rcb batsmen making Holder look like Bumrah,12
Let me tell you how this is gonna go...RCB will struggle to a decent ish underpar score of like 139. Then SRH chase it easily as everyone hopes for a collapse that never comes.,25
Bunch of wankers.,2

So they put AB to open the match...,7
Bc I thought it was Kohli’s bday yesterday so he will be in great mood to have a new start today. On top of it he was opening. So I thought aaj phodega launda bc 6 runs and out. Dream 11 captain wasted,12

Masterstroke by Koach and Padikkal to make the best batsman in their team face the most balls.,52
[All hopes lies on this man](https://youtu.be/r89VMoUJ_y4?t=83),6

Horrible powerplay for RCB. Then Rashid will choke them further in middle overs. RCB will be lucky to get to 140 here,8
Holder has changed SRH fortunes this year.,12
At this point i have no hope left for us what can ab do in this situation :(,5
Is it too much to ask for a competitive match,8

He is a bang bang finisher not an innings builder.

Why RCB. EVERY GOD DAMN TIME,7
Holder just removed orange cap competition for Warner,3
The thing is SRH brought AB out early so they can't get AB'ed later on.,3
ABD gotta play till 20th over with zero brain dead shot selection. Looks like a tough night for RCB,4

Holder has been such a ace for SRH his inclusion has strengthened batting lineup and his bowling has produced some crucial wickets. Was late inclusion but a inclusion that resulted in significant results. Kudos to SRH management.,5
Sunrisers are gonna be the champions aren't they,1
At least the batting collapse is in the first innings today so that I won't have to suffer for as long.,6
"At this point, I have lost all hope for RCB, and my mind, on every ball, just thinks about how this ball will be a wicket. 12 years have taught me well not to expect anything, but I still did this season. My bad.",9

FYI it's 4.1 overs already and we are 16/2,3

It is all up to the overseas players now,2

"This 13th IPL season. Most of us may experience 50th season. Most of us may not live up to see 100th season. But almost all of us have seen 1st season. In 100th season and 50th they'll talk about the first season, and the IPL that was conducted in Dubai due to pandemic. They'll play videos.

WHY ARE RCB PLAYING WITH TWO PACERS??????? WTFFFFFFF,5
"Alright, irrespective of what happens it sounds like Holder will be a first choice member of the squad next season. That being said I hope we don’t just release Bairstow. CSK, DC, and KXIP each have a free foreign slot and they’ll definitely rush to buy Bairstow.",3
One more wicket and we get the 49 memes out,5
Holder is one of the most underrated players. No matter which team he is representing he’s never considered an important commodity,7
"Live game prediction: AB is gonna hang around until Rashid comes on. He will have a hard time scoring against Rashid. In order to put Rashid under pressure, he will go for a needless big hit knowing not much batting is left and get out.",3

Why does Finch have a spring below his boot? Jumping every ball.,3

150 seems like it'd be a great score on this pitch. Should just focus on rotating strike,3
"People dissed us for reverse jinxing, no we weren't.",2
Finch is clearly struggling. At least Josh was confident.,2
WARNER FAKE FIELDING,4

Warner excited too much!,1
Is goswamy any good?,1
"Fake fielding by Warner, give 5 runs to RCB.",5
Honestly fuck Rcb,3
"Some RCB fans were being royal cunts yesterday when DC were losing. Fuckers forgot that DC will get another chance on Sunday. Their choker team is getting knocked out tonight, suck on that you Muppets. Serves you right for jumping the gun and being royal cunts",2
Just play SRH v MI already that is the worthy final.,2
Warner fake fielding. Is that a fine?,3
DISSOLVE THE FUCKING FRANCHISE,6
Can’t even hit a boundary at the moment,1
Lmao that bluff by warner,6
"Man, DC's and RCB's souls are actually interconnected or what",3
"For all those rcb fans who had hope before this, this is why we warned you",5
Murali Karthik needs to STFU,8
Fake fielding give us 5 runs pls,11
Imagine losing two wickets against SRH before Rashid Khan comes in to the picture,9
But I mean Kohli did ensure he didn’t get dismissed by Sandeep,18
If abd plays all the remaining overs we may get 150,6
Shot!!!!,2
"We don't want SRH in finals, RCB don't pull an RCB today!",4
I feel that every team suddenly gets in peak form against RCB (take DC for example),12
"Gand hi mar li Holder ne to


T : well bowled holder",6
Ab is weak against leg spinners and srh has the best leg spinners,2
"All jokes apart, DC and RCB are so similar it is no wonder we are performing so similarly. One Good Opener, Other Opener MIA, Misfiring #3, Finishers have won 2-3 Matches, to name a few",1
Suddenly Mumbai (although with rested players) losing to Hyderabad doesn't seem so surprising. It's gonna be Mumbai vs Hyderabad finals and it's gonna be 50/50,5
"So RCB struggling against pacers and have 2nd innings 4 spinners with dew, typical RCB fuckup",6
Nice shot Finchy,4
The RCB video in the yacht with Indian Borat really aged well.,6
Why didn't SRH take bairstow??? It's not like Kane is performing better than him,2
[deleted],5
"What are they saving those boundaries for, Rashid Khan?",18
Samad is handsome,15
We are one wicket away from viewership halving and turning off their screens....advertisers must be sweating.,6
Toast your nose. Put it in a boiling pot. Herb it. Salt it. Put it on a plate. Cut it into pieces. Then crunch it and eat.,0
Man punjab would have been such a competitive team in playoffs.,11
Finchy's day today?,3
Aussie and protea in a knockout. What gives?,2
Gavaskar has broken the record for speaking absolute nonsense,8
"Moral victory tho, Koach didn't get out to Sandeep",11
Biden has lead in Pennsylvania btw,14
My expectations were low but holy shit,2
What's with this ABD is batting so early? He isn't a tailender slogger to come after 15 overs.. he Plays till 15 overs and RCB will be dominating the match...,3
Chutiya aakash chopra now saying Kohli shouldn’t have opened ahead of Finch. This clown has like 4 videos on YouTube where he was saying one of Kohli/Sundar should open.,21
Kane looks like he’s preparing to dress up as Santa Claus by the time Christmas comes around,4
"Bring Spin


Don't let AB play 2-3 overs of pace.",3
Rcb imploding:*just like the simulation*,1
RCB should play 6d chess and release ABD so that their team doesn't depend on him.,9
RCB 200 incoming.,1
ABD and finch show with bat today... 6 overs 30+ and 20 overs 180+,3
Dube yawning like Sarfaraz,11
Why is that dugout so empty lol,3
The guy sitting next to Dube is how I see everyone on /r/cricket,3
Why was Finch dropped in the first place and what was Phillipe supposed to do to keep his place??,0
Punjab and kolkata died for this,8
RCB analyst is dead.,5
"I thought Chintu only made apps,now he paints the house as well huh?",4
RCB fans were hoping to reverse jinx the team’s performance but ended up reverse jinxing the reverse jinx,3
Almost 3 overs of dot balls goddamn,3
Kanos don't dive for certain boundaries. The last thing SRH need right now is another injury.,3
Kohli is like my first manager. He also used to leave all his work for us to complete.,7
"Nibba: Ekdum se waqt badal diya, zazbaat badal diye, zindagi badal di.

RCB fans: Chup kar BC! Hamare liye toh yeh normal zindagi hai",6
Kane would have saved the boundary if he'd shaved. Too much drag while running,8
Imagine being a kkr fan and seeing the dream 11 ad with all the playoff captains and morgan,10
4D chess by Kohli. Can't get out to Sandeep if you can get out to Holder.,82
Nattu <3,3
Projected: *92* Ooof,4
"Swann is here now, let the circus begin",5
Moeen bhai has no expectations from his teammate. He is ready to jump in.,13
That boundary shot was timed so well. Good shot,7
ABD scored 66 (38) in the only Eliminator he's played for RCB before this.,10
"5 overs up

16 dots ball out of 30 balls",15
Warner is a great captain but I hate it when he doesn't bring Rashid early for such situations. Even same happened in last game vs RCB,1
Kohli please come back to form in the Aus tour. Make your usual IPL captain decisions today and let SRH pass.,4
"""Aeo cocky""",6
"Chadarmodo, grow some balls. play bold. Score at least 170+.",6
Come on chewing gum boyy,11
Disappointed as a RCB Fan. Should have let KKR pass through as they were far deserving !! Hope RCB survives 20 overs and get as many runs as they so they can atleast put up a fight .,-6
93 projected score 🤡,53
Wish there was team from Haryana. Best state from India,-2
"Idc how good Nattu gets, no way should he be allowed into the national team with that neckbeard",12
South Africa,1
"Finding gaps and hitting fours is so bad this entire season, only padikkal seemed to do it well.",8
"On one hand, we have MI losing the toss and absolutely smacking the living daylights out of DC. And here we have RCB bottling it beautifully.",12
Will Finch rise from the ashes tonight?,4
"RCB modus operandi:

1. Bat first

2. Bat like absolute shit, struggle to even touch the ball. 

3. Trick everyone into thinking it’s a bowling pitch. 

4. Score 135

5. Opposition chases it down in 10 overs. 

6. Shockedpickachu.jpg",149
The guy who mentioned crease fielding might be on to something.,1
I have a feeling that these both will put a 100+ partnership,2
Tbf batting first in Abu Dhabi has been ass for a few matches now. Really good toss to win.,0
"I miss the fan map, vodafone army",3
"Polls say SRH 73% to win this match.

So looks like RCB will win.",9
Watch as rcb gets 70% vote cause SRH fans are gonna vote for RCB too,9
If we somehow reach 140 with the help of finch and abd. Do good bowling in pp. Spinners do their job then i think we would be able to take the game to 18 over and not make it an embarising loss.,6
"All they need to do is get to 150. With Saha out, SRH will have a hard time chasing that.",6
"Man, I feel sad for koach",8
[deleted],107
Whatever this shit team making into playoffs is an achievement,8
"Relax guys,I know it’s a bad start but it’s not over. There’s still a good 15 overs left and the pitch looks quite good for bowling so don’t lose hope and of course it’s never over until Mr.360 is around.",9
"I too, enjoy this shortened test match format.",12
Dada scrolling through r/Cricket,25
Ganguly checking out this Reddit thread on his phone,13
If ABD and Finch can get a 100 run partnership in 12 overs then RCB would be set for a large total.,4
Ganguly was setting his champion team in mycircle app,3
"Of all the ridiculous Dream11 ads, I like Bumrah's the most....

Bumrah is such a gentleman cricketer. Rahul Dravid of today.",9
Warner is P U M P E D,7
Obligatory ganguly shot,7
RCB need to get at least 180 to win this. If not this is too easy for SRH,8
Warner showing intent in the fielding and Jason encouraging is wholesome,11
5.5 I forgot this was the power play...how are we only 28-2,8
Only ab special can save us,5
"""Kem cho, Dada? Maja ma?""",6
Swann wants Ganguly to take off his shirt again,4
Koach's job starts now. Watch AB bat and admire.,17
Koach in post match today: we just played 15 minutes of bad cricket and that costed us the match,13
Finchy on 🔥🔥,2
There is Sky and Ground difference between MI batting and RCB's batting. They show intent from 1st ball even though they are 1 or 2 wicket down. And here is RCB shitting in bed after losing 2 wickets. That's the difference between balanced team and team with only individuals.,8
We’ll take it anyway they come. Yesss Finchy good shot /s,1
so is the dew waiting for rcb batting to finish? how does it work?,5
Just realised Warner with his moustache looks like Super Mario.,4
I gotta admit I don't like SRH but I dislike them less than I dislike RCB hence supporting SRH tonight,7
[deleted],7
Someone predicted RCB will be 30 after the powerplay,4
Padikkal will not score 500 runs now . fuck this shit,4
"Abd, Just retire man. I’ve seen you lose enough now. That’s it I’ve reached my limit.",3
Pandey got a memeable pose there.,4
RR STONKS,1
"Last night it was mountains ,today it's Star wars 


If one of KKR/RR/KXIP got in Dugout would be a lot more spicy",7
What's the use of winning all domestic championship if you can't win one IPL at least? Looking at you KXIP and RCB players from Karnataka.,4
"SPINNERS, where are they?",3
"Ah do I remember the 2016 qualifier 1 Vs GL

Don't let me down AB",14
"Holder swinging the ball like a hoopla and Rashid to come, RCB need to target Natty and Sandeep.",3
If both of them can take the team to 110 by 15 without losing another wicket. Then Game on baby,9
Just another manic ~~Monday~~ RCB campaign.,3
"Somebody said RCB would be 30-0 because Koach is opening.  
  
well...",11
"Rashid is going to be bowling in the middle overs and if they want to reach a decent total , they have no choice but to go after him. Can't play it safe",7
Does Ganguly ever watch a game? He is always on the phone every time.,7
"Ahh Nattu leaking runs. Should bring Rashid against ABD and finch. Now that powerplay is over, need two wickets so runrate slows down",2
"rcb batting too sensible, singles and a boundary every over",6
Even his neckbeard is flying in the wind wtf Natarajan,14
"At this time in ipl, it isn't SRH v other teams, it's SRH v injury monster. Who will win?",1
"First 5 overs, Dugout has a 25 minute dialogue on swing bowling, how to play it and the challenges in licking up late swing. Then Swann comes and we have a dialogue on pronunciation of Natarajan and the hideousness of Ganguly's shirt. 

Dugout is the place to be. Everything for everyone.",25
Oh no AB vs Spin,5
How many SRH players are injured in total?,1
Spin choke time,1
"oh god, ABD is gonna destroy our spinners isn't he?",8
Spin vs Finch lmao,0
ABD quick fire innings & inshallah back on the menu bois,5
Why did Kohli open?,1
"Brilliant power play RCB, brilliant stuff 🙏🙏 /s",7
"Guys, time to panic? These two look settled.",4
If AB stays till 15th over and finch scores a quick fire 50 and Moeen  whacks a bunch of sixes towards the end then it’s called wishful thinking,5
Ganguly is making a team on Dream11 to make up losses on My11Circle for picking Koach and DDP,12
Really angry rn but i kinda feel sad for koach,10
"Where's that guy who predicted 30/0 in 6 overs after seeing virat open. I had downvoted  you, sorry bro.",78
Inb4 rcb still scores 200,5
"I don't think nadeem will get ABD like last time. Nadeem should try to stop leaking and put pressure, Rashid will attack wickets",10
"Ever feel useless?

Remember there is an announcer with no crowd",117
Counting on Finch taking on the spinners successfully along with Moeen.,13
Finch is a big match player.,19
So it's ABD vs SRH now.,10
Playing tuktuk cricket and Rashid hasn't even come yet.,6
ABD feet starting moving.... diwali coming in early!,1
why are srh fans scared of THIS rcb team?,11
"Man what a GREAT signing Holder was

Surprised he went unsold",11
Conspire with the cricketing god's for ABD to still be there come the 20th over.,10
"This is probably the worst side rcb have played this season, and that's saying something considering gurkeerat is not there.",14
That's brilliantly bowled,1
Warner’s so happy lol,8
AB need ur magic cant rely on finchy,8
"Finch crosses 20. 
RCB staff: I see this as an absolute win.",17
Finch should watch his 156 Vs England innings before batting in IPL,18
Man SRH fans trying to reverse jinx is the worst thing ever :/,16
What's he saving Rashid for?,1
kohli fanpages already in mood for australian tour.,55
ABD - “how many times do I have to rescue this team? May be I am too nice and they r taking advantage of me”,93
Finch & ABD - no unresolved rifts of Sandpaper gate?,11
Best day for a neutral to wanna see ABD perform well,7
We were worried about middle overs & fucked up in Powerplay,38
I think 49 is safe .,10
"If any fan is actually scared of rcb, let me say this, it's an insult to your team",9
"Big potty in the Yaat.

My ass.",1
"Okay score prediction. Any guesses ?
Me : 162",2
Now Koach will get pissed and wreck the aussies,22
can kohli be removed from the India squad to Australia?,-9
"Pls stop thinking only abd can do this, there is finch, moeen ali, shivam and sundar so pls jinxing him",4
"Who is the better replacement this season ?
Nortje Or Holder",3
I have a feeling that I shouldn't watch the Australia Tour,2
tumhari expo ki maa ka bhosda,3
Land Choos Koochli OUT? Damn i was ready to shit on him all night.,-6
Smh i expected atleast 1 odi century from Kohli on the aus tour. But seeing how he got out today inspires no confidence,2
70 runs in the first 10 overs and I give us a chance,3
I feel like 90% of the boundaries Finch has scored this season was basically him trying to shield himself from the ball and accidentally ending up with a boundary..,2
look on the bright side. 2020 effect has worn off. 2020 is finally over,3
"I won't be surprise if finch turn up today, his inner Australian roaring from inside to show up in a big match.",2
Am i the only person whos genuinely happy with some of the changes made? Some were forced but they were pretty bold considering the playoffs. And i feel kohli opening has to be the way to go too. Only me?,12
"Is this a big ground? 

What's a useful competitive target here?",2
"It's kind of hilarious that BCCI President endorses one ""fantasy app""(Mycircle), Indian captain endorses one ""fantasy app""(MPL) and BCCI's golden goose's main sponsor is another ""fantasy app""(Dream11).",14
"RCB, although they were a meme team, used to be entertaining. 

Now with the bat they're the most boring side in the entire league. At least on par with both CSK and DC. That just sucks.",11
"Practice match for SRH.

Wait, ""2"" practice matches for SRH This one and the next.",3
"Obligatory ""oh yes, Rashid""",5
This run of form all started with the loss against CSK. Fuck CSK.,8
"""oh yes rashid""🤤",4
Finchy gets a nice platform to get back to form before the India tour :),6
I can hear boss music,5
Anybody ever tried Oaksmith? It's the best whiskey (by far) you can get under 1500.,1
These a wicket rash.,3
200 IQ move by RCB to get rid of Kohli before he tuk tuks in the middle overs /s,12
37 in 7 overs. 4 overs of Rashid left. Lmao RCB,7
Finch wanna be tewatia,1
"[https://gfycat.com/HospitableSaneCollie](https://gfycat.com/HospitableSaneCollie)

Afghan jalebi entered the chat,5
Both of them can't pick leg spinners lol,8
common finchy dont give us heart attack !!,4
"From 2015, RCB has almost changed their core team completely apart from VK, AB and Yuzi.",9

"Rashid in

Dugout: *Wahahah, wickets alert*",8
Where is Gurkeerat? We could have used him here,3
Going down leg.,1
"Yes, we've taken 2 wickets but let's not take RCB lightly unless we take Abd's wicket.",3
Cmon Finch man just one game ffs,13
Rashid Anna lost touch in previous match. Hope he finds rythem. So far not one good ball. He is looks confident,2
"Cricbuzz: ""It was an Aussie all rounder who did it for Srh in 2016."" My memory sucks, who was it? Ben cutting?",16
I'd like to say toss was a major factor for RCB during second half of the season but we've not really sorted our batting out for years. Good that we at least have put together a decent bowling unit,2
[deleted],5
Rashid is back,3
That’s right boys. Respect the youngster in rashid khan,5
Can’t figure out if Swanny is genuine with these compliments or if he’s taking the piss?,2
"Seriously though how the fuck did Finch manage to hit two of the highest international T20s score, he looks clueless in IPL",9
39/2 after 8 superb. Keep going boys,17
Rashid is the forever emerging player,23
F,2
Oh god! Finch has retained the strike :(,4
"Bruh holder so good, I wanted KXIP to buy him in the auction but he went unsold haha",8
Rashid 'unplayable' Khan,5
Just tuned in RCB got in 3 New Foreigners???????,5
Call an ambulance.,3
"If ab stays till the end, it could get destructive very quick for srh",4
"Finch and AB can blast,take us to 170",1
"Louda wasting deliveries now. 

Should have sent Sundar to donpinch hitting.",-2
Rashid’s overs seem to go by so quickly,5
This is kinda depressing ngl. They are gonna let Rashid go at 2 an over and theres nothing they can do about it.,3
Football fans is there player that you liked so much as we like Abd  even after we’ve never won. Just curious!,6
"Ironically, SKY is exactly what RCB need. A middle order batsman who can hit and smash in the death",7
[deleted],3
RCB from 6-15 - It's test match time boys,9
Is this a test?,3
What is Finch’s highest score in the ipl?,1
RCB line up reflects the muddled thinking towards the back end of the tournament unfortunately,2
Getting a decent bowling department this season is the best thing for RCB this season.,5
Yes Virat. Your 4 spinners would love to defend 140. Keep up the good work.,7
Bc the dream11 ads aren't even synched properly,5
DC was much better after 0/3 lol,8
Looks like another 10 wicket win here by SRH.,4
"If not now, then when?",1
Going in with 4 losses probably didn't help either,3
Who should we support now?,2
RCB with 2 wickets down play like other teams would when they are 5 wickets down after the powerplay.,11
Sunny said ball isn’t turning. RCB is fuk with 4 spinners,9
"Projected 98

Seems legit",8
They look settled,2
How is this team even in playoffs lmao,7
Koochli had fuckboi attitude.,1
Is it Raa-shid or Ru-sheed? I say Ru-sheed? Am I saying it wrong?,5
Me and rcb singles forever,10
I think umpire warned Nadeem not to use his saliva,7
Watching Sky and Kishan not giving a fuck about Rashid was funny,19
***Where is my test gang or is it only reserved for CSK?***,11
Watch how they score at below 5 rr in the next 7 overs and then get out trying to hit big,7
Can’t afford to get only 6 from bowlers other than Rashid,3
"*Sees current run rate*

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",5
"Guys, in which over can we lose and still qualify for the next match? 17.3?",9
40 runs after 8 overs. RCB the new DC,3
i guess anything above 150 will be hard to chase,3
That is one thing i like about rr . Their batting starts after losing 2 wickets.,9
RCB score 126 and they have a chance. I heard that SRH does like that number,11
"Jokes apart, Kohli was really unlucky to get out like that.",15
Moeen/Dube need to take Rash apart otherwise no chacne for us,3
Now watch Finch throw it away,6
[removed],5
"Just watch,next season Finch will be released, some other team will take him and he’ll have a stellar season. SMH",29
Would dew make it easier to bat later on ?,2
Nadeem is bowling brilliantly,1
Projected score 99 :(,10
ABD looks like a guy on mission. He is playing cautiously and want to take his team home. We are fucked,5
"Inb4 ""we were 50 runs short""",12
"Virat bhai ne playoffs party karli pehli hi, he saw it coming already",9
Does anyone know why two of the best strikers in the game are struggling? Are SRH bowlers that good?,2
"All the big brain ppl asking to send Finch in at 5 so he can tonk the spinners, here you go... Plays like a fucking potato in the IPL for some reason",13
Gotta feel for ABD. All I've seen him do this IPL is firefighting.,14
Projected score 99 and only 2 wickets gone lol,1
Why are they playing 4 spinners.,5
"Finch and ABD should get a move on now. 

This kind of relaxed scoring isn't gonna be enough.",5
"Ah yes, the Jadhav effect™",2
Sunny so bored of this shitshow he's talking about yesterday's game. Lol,9
Too much hype on srh.Srh supporters need to reverse jinx.,9
"Dont think the ball is coming on to the bat nicely rn. 150-160 would be interesting. 

Dew might be a factor later, but 2 early wickets and RCB will be heavy favorites in that scenario",0
"Kohli would have complained that the batsman were too slow had this been a test match, thankfully it’s a t20",13
Fuck you and your mi wanking sunny g,22
SRH is slowing the game down brilliantly,10
This is painful,7
Is this the 2nd timeout already,4
Is gavaskar always fangirling MI,3
They'll have to somefuckinhhow get 120 off the last 10 overs,4
For some reason batsmen moving to  leave their wicket open makes me nervous,5
Is that Pant behind the stumps?,1
"We can do it boiis, just 4 runs to go",3
"switched to dugout commentary since y'all were talking so highly about it, but the hindi commentary is way more entertaining imo",9
Good ODI innings,6
Play out the spinners to get out to the Pacers...,3
[deleted],8
How many balls since no boundaries?,3
They have played too cautious for a 20 overs match.,8
I think 180 should be a respectable target in the eliminator,2
I think most people are failing to realize rcb is just making it look like the pitch is hard to beat on,8
"45/2 is far better than 0/3, atleast both are forming a partnership can form a big score",12
Almost half the inning is done & not even 50 on the board. Great signs!,2
Congrats SRH,0
This is the problem with Rcb's batting. They go multiple overs without scoring a boundry . A boundry an over is a basic requirement in a T20 match,5
Can someone please start working on  Jason Holder appreciation post,5
"[MI and SRH till now](https://i.redd.it/n8tlnfrkac251.png)

Imagine RCB but with hardik lol,10
Anyone know how I can get Dugout on US Hotstar?,1
"9 overs 45

20 overs 100 ??",5
Srh really got lucky with marsh injury. They got one of the best all rounder as replacement,3
It’s fine if these two just play them around. They can accelerate later and get Rcb to 160>. It’s better than them getting out trying to score and us stumbling to 130.,2
Inb4 sundar gives 5 runs in 4 overs,0
This is a 50 over game right?,6
Hit ffs,2
"Aim for 140, surface looks hard af to bat on",3
"watching RCB bat I hear sad KKR, RR, KXIP and CSK noises",13
SRH games are choke holding.. most un-entertainers for galleries,9
Both batsmen looking to take it deep.,2
Looks like RCB were more than happy just to be in playoffs than winning the trophy,9
"I bet rcb wish they had Eoin ""Let me casual tonk Rashid for the most runs by a single bowler in a wc game"" Morgan huh!",12
"I need to practice reverse jinxing for finals, else these SRH guys are tough to beat.",2
"Fans: Sanju Manju is so biased.

BCCI: Ok, we give you Sunny G

Fans: *pikachu face*",5
Srh legit contenders if bhuvi is fit. Imo mi rr and srh have the best squads,3
How are other teams able to attack? I've forgotten what attacking in the middle overs looks like,9
"Rcb fans the past 5 games:

""RCB are going slow but it'll be okay"" both batsmen get out when they accelerate

""The pitch is really bad, if Kohli can't hit, no one can"" opposition win by 10 wickets in 16 overs

""The other team will choke"" refer 2",4
Being RCB fan is not easy. Year after year it takes toll on you.,7
RCB fans shouldn't complain as long as these two are in the middle. Dube isn't going to take you over 160.,3
Who keeps telling RCB that it's an ODI tournament?,5
Rcb dont have other pacers do they? Im pretty sure thats why they went 4 spinners?,3
"How we are batting atm

1. MS Dhoni

2. MS Dhoni

3. MS Dhoni

4. MS Dhoni",7
Why so many changes from RCB?,2
"More than anything, the fact that the aggressive Virat Kohli is lost somewhere rn is hurting me much much more.😭😭😭😭",3
"For 9 years, RCB have changed 40-50 players, appointed and sacked 7-8 coaches and have even tampered with the ""Director of Cricket"" and stuff.

The only constant has been the captain. 

Until and unless they gather the balls to sack Koach as captain, RCB simply will not get anywhere close to the title.

Am I saying it will provide instant rewards? Nope. But at least it's a change. Nothing can be worse than this decade. Just do something new for fuck sake.",4
How good a player Jason Holder is...doesn't get enough recognition...an underrated champ in the flamboyant windies lineup,6
Lol vvs lax looking like he is giving insights to holder,1
MI might just regret letting us win if we continue this form to the finals,0
The only win with the stupid rcb's bowling picks is that they will have to open the bowling with siraj.,2
How much would be a score that’s competitive on this pitch?,1
Is RCB shitting the bed as usual? Or there's something in this pitch?,2
140 in the next 11? Who am i kidding we are scramble to 130 and say we were 20 runs short.,3
RCB is the true thala army,4
"They've dug a massive fucking hole, all SRH have to do is lower the coffin. Even 120 in the next 11 overs puts us at 165 which is below par with the dew",3
"Maybe if ab gets out, I will feel slightly more relieved. But with him in, anything can happen",7
Watch bat on different surface altogether,4
Forgot how it looks like attacking,4
"Poor chap this Kohli, gotta feel for him. Whenever he tries something new, it almost always never works out for him. While other captains are fairly successful with that.",7
"With a left hand off spinner and a leg spinner, Moen could play a match winning innings if he comes in to bat now.",3
Yaay we reached 100 projected guys,6
"> Swanny out

lol",3
Bumrah took 27 wickets fucking hell,11
"Honestly, if Hyderabad qualifies for the finals and wins the toss against Mumbai, I'd say they've won the trophy.",3
"This is so boring. Atleast RR would have put on a fight. Take out ABD and RCB is a pure shit team.

DC even after losing 5 wickets yesterday showed more intent than RCB who has only lost 2 wickets.",2
Launched,7
Wtf eion morgan in playoffs??  Wtf dream 11? i think they they made this ad before srh vs mi and they were confused who will qualify lol,3
Wooo,2
Shot,3
Hanuman chalisa intensifies,7
"Aaron Finch, that you?",2
Cunted,5
Oh no i think hes gonna get bowled thru the gates now,1
Rashid looks pissed,1
[deleted],2
Yesssss finch boy,5
T20I Finch back.,4
[deleted],2
"Wow, what a shot. Finchy connected it so well",3
That was like antacid for my heartburn,3
Where did that come from lol,2
Not even the commentators are interested in the six lmao,3
Don’t do that... don’t give me hope,6
Good stroke from finchy time to accelerate,1
"sometimes i forget that rashid is not invincible, he's been so consistenly good most of this ipl",2
kohli and pressure game,1
Oh shit.,6
And it begins,5
Was that Rashid's first six?,2
We're so fucked aren't we?,4
Some air to breathe atlast.,3
Rashid for six!!! Now i can sleep .,4
Now Rashid will hulk up,3
The good people at Unacademy can breathe easier now,5
Lol AB dropping bat,3
Panic mode,2
Take this guy out Rash!,4
Go finchy go !!,1
Finchy smacking Rashid oof,2
[deleted],2
"Yeah, now he'll get out",2
Anyone remember Kohli the finisher during the WI series earlier this year :(,3
That was unacademic Finch,3
Luckily Ashwin wasn’t the bowler,6
Look at Finch not giving a fuck about Rashid 🤡,8
"8D tactics by ABD distracting Rashid, for Finchy to catch his breath",4
"BY  THE POWER OF WATSON, I GOT THE POWER",3
How is Rashid so fucking good in T20s and not such a threat for his national team?,3
SRH in trouble if they don't break this partnership,2
LMAO Dugout talking about Altroz sales 😂😂,7
Is there anyway to change a player loyalty?,1
You should never allow Rashid settle in. He gets nervous if attacked successfully.,2
Finch: look I'm Watto now,4
kohli following the blue print of Thala,4
Kohli is nervous af,4
SRH: We neither let you bat well nor we do,6
FINALLLY FUCKING  FINALLY,3
Finchy boi is here,6
Graeme swann is too funny man. Wish I switched to dugout earlier,6
"Rashid still processing that six. He isn't used to it

*Aise kaise maar diya bc*",55
Finch playing for Fair play,8
"49 crossed, can sleep in peace today",13
Want to see Kanos taking a good catch,3
"Fellow RCB fans, we crossed 49",14
Rashid for SIX. Goodbye Finch,-1
Abd will be 37 next year. Can you poach him CSK?,3
Abd is settled. Now srh is fucked.,8
Which team did bangar coach,4
Who'll these two go after? is it everybody except Rashid?,1
SAVE US FINCH SAVE US,15
ABD and Finch partnership is looking good.,4
Atleast show some intent running between the wickets,2
ABD setting up for long game?,3
[deleted],7
Great running.,2
If Finch or AB somehow put Rashid under the pump then RCB can have a chance to get on top.,3
54/2 in 10 overs,1
[deleted],-1
Bruh wicket needed. Don't let ABD stay for long.,1
This would be a good contest if SRH only have 3 batsmen allowed to bat.,9
Need a mental final 10 overs for RCB.,3
"If they are playing this aggressive against rashid, they gonna go hard against Nadeem",2
ABD at the crease for too long for my comfort.,7
All isn't lost. 100 in last 10 is possible.. 154 can be defended in a knockout especially if you get Warner early.. RCB still needs to believe they can make a match of this..,6
Anything above 160 and it's gonna be hard for us chokers.,7
Calling an SRH batting collapse a bit early here,3
"After a six, rotate the strike. 

Wasted 2 more balls, trying something silly",3
Which channel is dugout on? I’ve had enough of this trash,3
Watch Kohli say we were thinking its 140 wicket and SRH score in 14 overs,5
Would have been satisfying if that landed on the altroz's windshield,6
"*49 crossed *

RCB fans mein khushi ki leher!",22
"I wish the matches weren't so dependent on the toss though. It's a big advantage for who bowls first. And no, Delhi with their shit bowling doesn't count.",5
170 is the best case scenario for RCB from here on. Anything less than 150 and they're mostly out of the game.,3
[deleted],1
"Ok we get it u need new furniture, but fb p kuu dalna h bhai

Ref: vi",2
How many boundaries till now?,1
Stadium DJ playing La Bamba woooohooo,1
Rashid doesn't look in good touch.,3
CSK didn't make the playoffs so they've possessed RCB players,2
did rashiid just say kano,3
Need 100 in the last 10 to get a fighting score,3
Nadeem bowling smooth. nice to see.,1
Maha wide,2
Were they playing Bamba?,3
"If abd stays rcb will score 80 in the last 4 , i could see holder and natarajan bowling fulltosses on his pads to him which he smashes for sixes easily",7
Stop reverse-jinxing srh fans lmao we’re scoring at 5 rpo,22
De Villiers with all this sweat looks like De Kock,2
sed lyf xoxo,2
"As a pacer, is there anything that makes one feel powerful quite like a swing and a miss outside off stump, and motioning for the ball back from the keeper?",1
Fucking knew it,4
"Oh look, Virat Kohli shit the bed in a knockout match.

Like he always does.",10
Goodbye Finch,1
"YEEES, DANGEROUS MAN GONE.",3
Finch also gone. Ffs,2
"I felt wicket coming, Nadeem was not giving anything to hit . Very nice .",2
Finally,3
Get fucked Finchy boi,4
Let’s go babyyyyt,1
Bye,2
"I think it's not koach, it's rcb's no 3 position

32(30) still arrives",15
"Well done finchy, more than expected tbh",3
[removed],1
Brett Lee can go suck a dick with this jinxing bullshit,5
I mean atleast he scored more than what was expected of him.,3
"Looks like this is another ""We were 20 runs short"" situation",3
It was just around corner with how Finch was going.,1
Should send Moeen.. he plays spin well..,3
Is hitting boundaries along the ground looked down upon in RCB?,4
There you srh fans you're panic reverse jinxing worked just fine.,9
Get in! My man Nadeem,2
Ffs,1
So predictable. Take 30 balls to settle down and throw it away,4
Kohli : Ben Stokes Ben Stokes,5
Fuckin trash team,17
Bye Bye Finch. RCB choking?,5
Finch is back... in the dugout,6
RCB ded,3
get abd and we should be finished here,2
Yess good job Nadeem!,1
"When the cricket world turned its back on Warner, Hyderabad was still rooting for him. If they manage to win the IPL after being down in the first half, it will be super special",4
Here comes the rcb tail..,5
Who was that sad face in the dugout/stand?,3
Cheers Finch. Wonder who you'll play for next season.,9
"Not needed from finch but alas, rcb, dc and kxip it feels like will never win the cup",7
"Everytime I see Samad on the screen, I get nervous.",2
That's the RCB I love,3
"**10.2** Nadeem to Finch, OUT,  **56-3**

AJ Finch c Abdul Samad b Nadeem 32 (30b 3x4 1x6) SR: 106.66",2
Ffs Finch! Just when you’d started going 🤦‍♀️,2
And yeah finch gone,1
Rcb pulling dc here lol,1
Samad was relieved he held onto it,2
3D in the stands 😂,3
No dube pls.,1
RCB has 4 spinners that have to bowl in Dew 😂😂😂,7
"Louda Finch. No timing. 

Simply moving in the crease naatak. 

Stay and hit u idiot.",6
I’m dead inside.,3
"Fuck it, changing flair to mumbai",2
"C'mon RCB fans, be honest. You didn't expect him to score 30+ score.",2
"Declare declare, Kohli should declare now.",2
Classic Finch innings.,1
Gg,1
When two high level international pitchers are struggling you just know the pitch is hard to bat on,1
This knock from Finch still better than every knock Koach played after the 90 vs CSK.,5
I almost feel bad for Kohli but then I remember that he's one of the most famous athletes in the entire world. I feel okay laughing at him after that.,6
Finch why do you disappoint me?,1
[deleted],1
rcb going absolutely nowhere near a challenging total. srh going to the final pakka.,0
"So two south African now
Amla and abd /s",0
Fraud. Nothing else to say.,0
"ABD: \_Fine, I will do it myself. Like I always do\_",1
Lucky Moeen ain’t in an England shirt otherwise it’d be 56/4,3
Finchy why you gotta give us that hope :(,1
OKAY SRH I SEE U,2
Back RCB now just to profit from volatility.,2
Thank god Finch isnt back to form before the Australian tour,2
Finch had to go for it,1
Only a miracle can save rcb from here,2
"Ahhhhh, know this feeling all too well",1
Pls score between 130-160 . We have a higher chance of chasing 200 than 120,2
"Koach: shit, I got out. 

Finch: no problem skip, I'll score that 32 (30) for you.",2
ABD is THE wicket we need. Can't celebrate till then...,4
"Welp , rcb lost",1
Moeen is the secret weapon which will be unleashed today,1
"You think 2020 can hurt me?

Jokes on you I'm an RCB fan",3
"Kohli already preparing his ""We were 20 runs short"" speech",3
Common boys.  Let’s finish this.,1
Is anyone else's Hotstar glitching like crazy and skipping time like Charlie Sheen on a Monday?,1
Finchy needed to go hit his vape,6
I would’ve sent Dube in man. Why all our overseas batsmen are playing,2
Why do I keep supporting this team knowing it always disappoints. and yet I know I’m gonna support it next year smhq,6
[Called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cricket/comments/jp3yo7/_/gbckugf),1
Rashid should get couple of wicket's,6
Hard chance for catch. :-/,2
[deleted],2
RCB need that mad Moeen Ali 200 SR innings he has every now and then,1
Is Moeen the best player of spin in RCB?,2
Now the great nadeem comes in,1
"Hello everyone, I'm so happy I'm not an rcb fan, that would be depressing. I see new happiness with this flair",4
Saha would've caught that :(,5
Jonny would have grabbed that,6
Lets just score 120 and wear KXIPs jersey,6
Rcb will win the world cup don't need ipl,4
Yeah now another wicket gone so play more dots so the next settles .,1
"Nadeem strikes , good wicket. Finchy looked settled, that six against Rashid was something else.",2
All I see are alcohol ads on hotstar. RCB effect?,3
So England fans gonna go mental if Moeen explodes here right?,4
Finch scored 18 runs off boundaries and still scored at only 106 SR. He is the anti Kohli.,4
So why does RCB batsman always find fielders with their mishits but the opponent batsman never return the favor?,2
Okay RCBians why don't we turn the tv off already,2
Inb4- Moeen ali destroys Nadeem's career in just 6 balls,5
Tbh all those changes would've been good if we won the toss,2
Moeen in,1
I don’t know if ABD will get out or not but my favourite wicket of his is when Bipul Sharma got him in the final in 2016. That was the turning point.,2
RCB got 4 spinners and pitch looks slow... SRH shouldn't be complement and keep picking up wickets and bowl tight.,3
Moeen looks just ready for that splendid 72(12),4
No ball,2
Oh fucking dear bro,3
There is a deep conspiracy against the great RCB team. Commentators and fans of all other teams coordinate a massive reverse jinxing offensive against them to make them miss their beat. Brave RCB and their fans persist and keep on despite these atrocities. Brave warriors.,2
"Our lord and saviour Moeen Ali, let's go pal",2
Noball by a spinner is a crime,7
Turning point?,3
Calling Moeen under 10.,2
Shit,1
F mate.,1
Ah them nukes,1
Moeen cmon pls whack it,2
Commentators curse strikes again,1
Oh no,1
Kohli said it's difficult playing in the bubble. Maybe he just wanted some rest before the Australian series.,1
"Funny to see how with almost every IPL team this season, either 90% if the team goes out of form or the whole team is in firm",1
Music to my ears,2
It's so irritating when a spinner bowls a no ball,1
Oh fuck Nadeem a no ball right now?,1
"Warner doesn't like to keep slips, idk why. Dhoni, Rohit and Gambhir uses when spinner is on song.",1
Finally something for RCB. A no ball,3
"FBI open up !

Jesus Christ what the fuck is this free hit alarm",1
"Cardinal sin for a spinner, fine him for this shit",3
Holy shit,2
NO BALL LOL,2
No balls from a spinner are just criminal.,1
Could Goswami have done better there?,1
Spinners overstepping is always good banter,1
Step and fetch it bowler overstepping? Beefy will be puking in his grave.,1
Sunny G said Samad is a very very good fielder. Lol,1
Why was Saha dropped?,2
Oof Nadeem,2
No ball. Maaro BC,2
"Fucking hell, that's so close. Anyway bad",2
Lol he's dreading bowling the freehit because he knows it's ABD he must deal with.,1
Commentators mf always jinxing us,1
Finch breaking the law of averages.,1
"Fuck, this will change the momentum. Advantage RCB and Ali will literally",1
[deleted],1
Fuck this shit,3
Moeen gonna score that quickfire 4(6),4
"Bro you're walking in, how do you bowl a no ball?",3
"If RCB somehow manage to win this, the next finals qualifier between DC and RCB should just be Ponting and Koach in a stressed-out chewing-gum-off",4
Let's see when free Hit,3
That's the sound that plays when Biden is gonna drop the Nuke.,4
Yeeesss Rashid well done. Hahaha,3

You can't really be mad at your team if srh wins the toss. They're already good and with the massive toss advantage it's already game over.,1

"SRH is so fucking lucky, once they started going down in the league, pitch started to become slow, supporting completely there bowling line up that hardly goes above 140.",3
"Yeah, now i can see why people say that Ali can do anything. He can Bat, bowl, field and can get runout on a free-hit.",6
Golden chocolate duck y'all,3
"RCB is out here to make a statement, that they will always be the meme team",8
"Why would you take that run, I mean you've already lost a wicket this over, and have had a boundary, just take your time to settle in. Taking risks for no reason smh",7
RCB fans must be very good therapists as they can teach others how to consistently deal with LoSS,1
I think Moeen legitimately forgot that you can get run out off a freehit. There was never a run there.,13
Lord Nadeem playing 8D chess over here with the no ball,7
need 2016 playoffs abds rescue act here.,8
Was that AB's fault or Moeen? Looked like AB was halfway down after the hit,3
That camera angle made it look like another run out was gonna come,8
How AB can stay in this team despite all the ridiculous shitshows that happens is beyond me. I'm sure any team would pay huge bags for him.,6
Man RCB is peak entertainment I swear,16
ABD decided its him Vs SRH now...,9
where is saha?,2
I am once again asking ABD to save RCB,12
Just RCB things,2
"I was waiting for Kohli and was wondering why he’s coming in so late only to find out he opened and is already out.

Pain",27
Once ABD is out I'm switching off TV,2
Lord Rashid: my goals are beyond your understanding,4
A tragically weak csk team. With only one team really clicking during the ipl. Yet both DC and RCB find it hard to get into the finals. Wtf,1
"at least DC's collapse was against world best seam attack

this is outright embarrassing",11
Run out on a no ball jesus Mo,23
Good bye guys meet you next year . This year we atleast qualified. Just hoping mi doesn't win.,3
I am sorry but i dont think i can support RCB anymore. At some point you have to let go. This team is shite and no one is doing anything about it. Time to just let go,0
I see RCB has done a RCB again.,1
I should stop supporting this team. I might live a few years longer.,8
ABD and runouts in crunch situations.,2
Swanny absolutely destroying Mo.,5
ABD deserves a better team....can Mumbai temporarily adopt him for the finals and get that man a trophy,12
This was the least deserving team to be in the playoff and it shows in their performance.,4
RCB still high from Koach's party.,12
RCB getting back to roots is a sign that we might find a cure for coronavirus and things will go back to somewhat normal,17
RCB and exploring new ways to get out.,5
"If ever there’s a sign that things just aren’t going your way at the moment, that’s probably it from Mo.

Run out off a free fucking hit, Jesus wept...",3
"I'm suprised at how RCB consistently continue to choke every year.

But then I'm also surprised at how consistently I continue to expect them to not choke every year.",8
Thats got to be the first run out of a free hit in the IPL.,9
3D chess by Nadeem,1
All planets aligned for Ali.. Friday in UAE.. facing free hit as first ball... still makes sure to runout,5
Ah I see current Moeen showed up.,3
"From Cricinfo

no Rashid, it's a free hit for Moeen, not you! A smooth pick up and throw from his left at extra cover to knock out the stumps at the non-striker's end. Moeen is at three yards out, not even in close enough to attempt a dive or a slide of the bat. It was a full ball fired outside off, cleared the front leg, hit it straight to extra and took off. It was hit too well to pinch a run",6
I think this might be one of the most embarrasing seasons i've witnessed for RCB,9
"So rcb, you were enjoying when you made DC bat 17.3 overs and when srh destroyed mi, in order to knock us out, right? Lmao",1
Moeen's ipl career finished in seconds,5
"Times like these make me happy I support csk. csk didn't do goof ups like this this year, just plain slow batting",2
why are we still here?,7
ChokeCB,9
"Kids: Hits 4 in free hit

Adults: hits 6


Legends: gets runout in free hit smh",103
Moeen has gone from one of the most beautiful batsmen to watch to one of the most depressing in short order,5
My mom literally just told me to stop watching this shitty game and go study lol,19
Rashid is big time match winner,1
Trump lost and RCB back to normal ? Guess the magic of 2020 is over,11
Don’t think I’ve seen a runout on a free hit before,6
moin ali is a mediocre cricketer at every level,-1
"I don't know what the gucling fuck it is with RCB, that their players constantly do mental shit like this",3
Only a superhuman innings from Abd will give Rcb a chance,6
Tries to take a single off a free hit and gets run out. Just  RCB things,8
It's literally Abd vs SRH now,8
hahahahahah RCB are a meme for a reason.,6
"Change the Mallya cursed name or change the captain.

Preferably both.",11
"RCB got into the top 4 because of the big win over KKR.  
Otherwise there was nothing to separate the two teams, off color for the most part with some spectacular showings in between.  
  
This lopsided team presided by a spectacularly one eyed captain is gonna meet their IPL end today",6
Underwhelming eliminator confirmed.,4
"6D chess by Rcb and eventually Delhi by losing to Srh, just to see Mumbai lose",4
"Has this ever happened before ?

Never seen a run out of a free hit before lmao

Only RCB things",8
Maynot go beyond 100 chase for SRh,2
"ABD should ask RCB management to let him leave for a better team next season. Guy deserve at least one trophy, not this shit.",13
Someone hit me. Slap me. For supporting this team.,16
RCB don't deserve to have made it through the league stages.,3
Moeen is obviously better than that but that was fuckin brain dead,7
It's a yoke. The team's a fucking yoke.,3
Directly to the fielder. Need to see the calling for that.,6
"Haaar  
Ceeee  
Beeee  
......",6
Lose a wicket on a free hit just RCB things,7
"RCB collapsing like.....well, RCB",12
"What do you guys prefer? Your Team playing like shit and ending up at the bottom or playing well in the start , then playing like shit and somehow ending up in playoffs... only to shit there as well??",8
"KKR lost their qualification spot marginally, to this team 🤦‍♂️ -_-
Feeling more disappointed now.",13
arey bhen ke takko ye kya kardiya,3
predicting AB wicket this or in the next over.,5
Please AB. Please,2
[deleted],10
Supporting RCB is not for the faint hearted,12
"ipl is a 2 month long festival of cricket where fans from around the country tune in to laugh at us, you’re welcome India",17
Only ABD left. Sad till now for RCB,4
RCB are about to party in the rented yatch  where Mr. Nags will remind them of the loss .,5
Another 10 wicket win incoming?,2
"AB just get out man 

End my misery",3
I can’t believe we came so far,2
How do you get A GOLDEN DUCK WHEN YOUR FIRST BALL IS A FREE HIT FOR FUCKS SAKE,8
Mo is a really nice guy but sometimes you wonder if there's anything between his ears with some of the shit he sometimes does.,1
Dube gonna screw srh without lube,-1
I don't know if to cry or laugh,4
Royal choking bastards,9
"Man I thought Moeen was a weird selection, but this one hurts. Love this guy and hate seeing him like this",5
We are not getting new IPL Winner are we?,1
Poor Moeen,2
RCB is the Meme that just keeps on giving...,14
Here's where I once again claim my disappointment in Dube not rhyming with Cube.,8
RCB.. never ceases to entertain. Everyone except it's fans.,12
Yo if u needed soemone to knock it about then Sundar was ur guy. Gotta keep someone to hit at the end mate on case ABD goes bust,1
ABD will announce IPL retirement if he gets retained.,9
What a bad shot that was for a free hit,1
Rashid Khan is the absolute madlad.,3
"So can we talk about Virat's performance in knock out games, last one i rem was 2016 T20 WC.",6
RCB is creating new records each seasons,8
"Alright overrated all-rounder, do something",6
I will shower naked if Rashid takes a wicket in today's match,3
Damn the energy they come up with in the field SEH. I love these guys,3
When will koach realize he is the panauti,6
Switching it off for now. Can't handle this anymore. Might come back to see Warner single handedly chase it.,6
De Kock has great offensive control. He would hit fours and score at 200 without risk or going aerial unnecessarily.,4
KXIP could never...we are the OG meme team bitches!!🤗🤗,11
Man I wanted to see moeen bat. Getting run out makes me mad.,1
"RCB fans right now: wakt badal gye, armaan badal gye

T: 2020 effect is wearing off",4
Imagine getting a free hit as the first ball you face and still managing to get out. That too against a spinner,8
Absolutely ridiculous running out for a free hit. We don't even deserve to go ahead. Its ok to just lose here than go through this pain again. Need a total change in team. See you guys next season.,9
At least you only have 2 and a half overs of spin left.,1
"I never wanted RCB to win because SRH is the only team that can take down MI. But everytime they struggle like this it makes me so sad, don't know why. I feel sooo sorry for them and their fans.",5
Looks like rcb is finding form,5
Which team is David Miller playing for this ipl,0
I felt like that was pad first,1
Knowing RCB they’ll probably release Moeen after this season :/,4
To all those non rcb fans who are making fun of us....just wait for lord dube magic,5
Gotta be real fucking dumb to get run out on a free hit after a no ball lmao.,3
Shouldn't have over performed that early on to give fans unnecessary hope - should have stayed on brand throughout,4
You haven't even seen Rashid's final form yet,1
"What are these deserved comments ? They won 7 matches right ? What defines ""deserved"" ?",5
"Can you believe this team. Partying one day before the elimination match against inform team, and Virat the worlds best batsmen suffering to score in domestic cricket. ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSING",12
the only way kohli can win the cup is if he does mid-season-transfer into MI a day before the final,6
Where is gurkeerat when you need him?,0
"""Nobody but MI deserves to be in the playoffs"" - r/cricket probably",8
"Get ABD to CSK for 2021.

CSK 2021 champions!!",2
Will be choking 126 SRH or Cruise 10 wickets SRH today?,4
Dube trying so hard to drag it to the stumps,2
Another disappointment by Virat in knockouts 🤦‍♂️,6
Is this the first team to get run out on a no-ball.,3
does rcb and dc even deserve to be in plaoffs?shld have been rr and kxip,1
WTF is happening 😂😂😂😂,4
Is it common to spit on the field?,3
Dune holding on for dear life.,3
[deleted],3
Dube definitely picking Rashid,3
"Last we’ll see of Ali in RCB? I feel like he could really fire in another team, CSK/DC should give him a try next auction.",6
was Rashid appealing for one tip one hand there,11
imagine getting out off a free hit,7
RCB pls change ur tagline from PLAYBOLD to PLAYSINGLES,12
WTF IS DUBE DOING,5
Punjab must be like yeh kya chutiya hai RCB aur DC wale. Atleast all Punjab games are competitive. These two are getting rolled over.,6
Gonna support RR from next year. 💔,7
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",3
Virat Kohli - Specialist in failure,1
"Bandwagon RCB fans : fuck this team, what a bunch of losers

Og RCB fans : I forgive you (Toby McGuire)",7
"This is just great, RCB somehow ends up coming to the qualifiers and acts like it‘s not an important match",4
"After every 6 balls that Rashid bowls, an over passes",6
Dube is a walking wicket,3
"This guy "" Sriram"" spin bowling coach is a panuati. Reason for Aus and Delhi Daredevils downfall.",5
Swanny imitating Warner is the funniest thing I've ever heard recently,9
I will get shat on for this but gotta say Rohit is a better limited over captain than kohli.,9
Koach seems like he is getting a lot of money so that he can spend an extended vacation with his wife and prepare to be a father while AB seems to be only guy who gives a fuck about what happens to RBC,7
Swann’s Warner impression is pretty decent,6
F for those lads in Bengaluru watching this match at a pub and paying for that overpriced beer,13
Gotta be something special to get out on a FREEHIT! Fuckin LOL,11
Lmao that accent,7
Kohli’s chopping and changing stategy has not been good for RCB and has also been pretty bad for India. I wish Rohit could captain India in LOIs,8
Dube effectively shielding ABD Against Rashid,5
few days ago SRH annihilated MI with 10 wickets win with 150 target,7
"RCB Fans: *""Ye dard jaata kyun nai""*",5
RCB finally reached a good powerplay score,5
I'll never understand how Shivam Dube has 13 international caps lol,5
DC and RCB showing why they don't often make it to playoffs.,3
I’m waiting for the day a batsman intentionally demolishes the stumps with the bat on a free hit,3
Dube looks like he picked up a cricket bat for the first time today,2
It baffles me how Moeen still manages to get picked for both England and RCB,7
Being a Hyderabadi RCB fan. Only positive is I can support SRH when rcb shits the bed which is every match they play,5
Dube all at sea against Rashid.,2
"Man, KKR would have entertained us more than this boring shit of a team RCB.",4
AB needs to get out so I can get some work done,2
"RCB is finding new ways to bottle it, I've seen it all. This is fucking hilarious",2
Genuinely feel Virat is negatively impacting Indian international t20 team prospects as a captain with top heavy focus.,1
Dissolve the team and donate the proceeds towards depression research,10
[deleted],4
Swanny's bogan is almost perfect.,6
I rather have seen KXIP here....at least their games are entertaining,5
Swanny's aussie accent is downright disrespectful and I love it,3
"Can anyone imagine Kohli during the post match presentation be like, ""45 minutes of bad cricket puts you out of the tournament""?",6
"I was watching for RCB, but now I’m listening for the dugout banter",2
"How the fuck does Dube have international caps? He looks a tailender, with his foot movement,screw this RCB quota seriously.",3
SRH inch ever closer to the final. They are r/cricket's best chance at seeing us lose.,3
Moeen was born to play for RCB,4
I wonder if anyone is still watching this match seriously,3
Mega choke job this,2
Dube batting like a tailender lmao,3
Its time to let AB go,2
"lol dew already in, rip RCB",3
holder wtf,2
"I hoped for a new winner this season, the odds have halved now I guess",2
"It is so heartening to see our fanbase melt yesterday and today RCB, Nature is slowly healing",3
Come on AB. Go super saiyan,4
Come on ABD play a good innings tonight.,4
Shabash holder,0
Only 4s please ABD,2
What's holder doing on the boundary.. painful.to see him run,0
"After Unbreakable record of 49, RCB team Creates another Record.

Got Run Out on Free Hit.",7

Ok fasten your seatbelts now,3
8 overs 100 runs only can save us,5
Kya gandu team hai,7
Lazy by Holder,2
#,2
It’s hard for holder to stoop down to peasant level,5
Surely there's no way AB can AB SRH today?,3
This South African dude is an imposter,7
RCB disappoints yet again. Guess what! I’m supporting them next year. *Laughs nervously*,10
wow this tuk-tuk is unbearable to watch even as a neutral,3
"Out of all things one can be, I don't want to be ABD's back in IPL",8
"Usually batting first is favoured in knockout games, rcb having been put out to bat first had a great chance of putting 155-165 on the board ..",2
RCB seem to be still high from that yacht party l,5
And this cunt Ali was retained over stoinis. Wow!!! I’m honestly speechless,4
Swanny’s Aussie accent or Gavaskar’s West Indian accent?,3
lol wtf fielding was that,2
RCB looked nervous today from the start,3
"Why that title, aren’t all matches eliminators from today’s match onwards",4
Siraj 6-fer needed,11
Dube's feet are stuck in cement.,5
New game: take a shot everytime the commentators mention Holder's height,7
Ohh Rashid was right,12
That was fucking out,8
"Oh shit, that could have been out",3
Have RCB ever been in control of a game,10
So we risked NRR to give Gurkeerat time in the middle and then didn't play him anyways??,9
[removed],13
"SRH getting to wear the orange cap without needing to score runs, smh.",18
That should have been reviewed,2
"rcb should be like dc and do a video on mental awareness. their fans really need it

source-myself(12 years of rcb experience)",9
"Damn, Rashid was right.",14
"RCB is anti midas touch.

When they touch gold it turns into copper",18
Does ABD knows even his magnificent innings will only give life to RCB for next 48 hours. Again on 8th Nov RCB batting order will shit. What's the point ? 😞😭😂,5
Rashid too modest to take the damn review smh,8
Kholi shithead be eating off 17 crores from RCB purse and performing as 20 lakh uncapped player.,4
All Moeen ali has done in IPL is destroy Kuldeep's confidence,17
DESIGNED FOR BASKETBALL!!,3
Oof should have taken that review,10
Honestly Philippe should have been given a chance instead of Moeen he's got better technique against spinners,3
Whose fault in that run - out?,2
Is dube really tall or goswami really short?,3
"Fuck that green jersey, it started this shit",8
Damn Rashid,2
atleast MI vs SRH will be a fair contest,2
does koach love to hit gym even after losing the game?,2
"I know Kohli is a huge brand but I just want to see RCB sack Kohli. For once, they should prioritise cricket, not the money. For once.",9
LOL that was out.,1
Man the WK should be more vocal on appeals,3
"Rashid with the runout was like ""These fuckers won't give me a wicket at least let me try and run him out.""",9
"I just can't help but wonder how none of the players are in form all the time (Exception ABD). It has been like this for quite sometime. When the same players change team, they suddenly are in form. With this team, getting into playoffs itself was a big thing. Enough of this.",5
"Kohli is like a huge penis  
  
People are envious of you for having it but it comes with its own set of problems, prominently the fact that it causes a lot of discomfort to everyone who has to deal with it",17
The toss played a massive role,1

"Paging the English dude who adopted RCB for this IPL? How do you feel, buddy?",7
Where is Naman Ojha?,3
Dube has to play the role that Mandeep did back in 2015.,11
So if Thala showed more intent in his innings RCB wouldn't have even made it,8
"That free hit run out was brought to you by Lenskart. 

*NAZAR HATI.....DURGHATNA GHATI*!!!",10
Graeme Swann's impressions are the best thing,8
This is Mallya's way of getting even with folks in India. Bad bad billionaire!,4
Am i the only one who thinks swannie is drunk while commentating,1
[deleted],71
ABD is so strong on backfoot.,3
[deleted],15
Best part of the RCB batting is Swanny's impersonations,8
The only thing I'll miss when RCB inevitably lose today is Mr. Nags :(,12
"Predictions?

120 in total?",3
I just noticed how tiny is shrevats Goswami!! Omfg,13
Last 9 balls of spin and Dube has to play maximum of those,6

"Nadeem owing AB, this is very 2020",2
"Look RCB supporters, I know it is looking like being 4 down for 30 odd in the eliminator SOUNDS bad but ABD is still there. He can still hit a quick fire 130(25) and RCB still has a way to win the electorial college in PA. Just stop the count! Wait what now ?",6
Can zampa bat?,1
"Swanny saying ""A free duck"" probably created the best name for a classic 6(2) innings",4
"Kohli just retire from ipl man, can't defend this shit anymore",4
RCB sack Kohli. Delhi buy him and play him. Delhi effectively India XI lol,12
Getting out on a free hit is the most RCB thing I’ve seen,8
Unlucky Nadeem. One four through an edge and one through a misfield. He was top class today.,5
"Completely out of context, but for some reason ABD reminds me of Hugh Jackman",3

"By now, I have FOMO in switching away from supporting RCB. After rooting for them for so long with no win, don’t want to support any other team only to have RCB win the whole thing... so guess I’m stuck till they win the cup, so all my best years of life.",4
RCB even when losing was always a team that was fun to watch. Just don't see that anymore.,5
Haha wouldn't it be funny if ABD scores a century haha,7

How can that be not wide... Ridiculous umpiring..,13
Not a wide? Hmm,7
I’m worried about ABD’s back. He has been carrying the team alone for some many years now.,9
Is the surface really slow or is rcb just shit ?,4
Btw why Koach warming bench ? /s,17
Nattu bowling a bouncer!? We've seen it boys.,8

Give Holder an over. Try risking Rashid to bowl the 15th,6
Need a meme macro from Warner expression when Rashid asked for the review,4
Dube rather than taking the pressure off by some hits is putting more on AB.,1
RCB better build a monument for ABD at Chinnaswamy.,9
State of a team when they have to change 3 foreign slots in a playoff game.,4
Mods please make a post on why Kohli is called Koach and pin it,9

So it starts.,3
4 off rashid! ABD is courageous,7

Its going to be funny after all the talk about the pitch when Warner comes out and hits it easy peasy,5
Gotta love Kohli's enthusiasm,7
Come on AB. Entertain us . Been a while .,9
The carnage begins. Anything over 120 and we are done. With abd 150 is always on the cards or even more.,6
ABD is looking good,9
Oh god oh fuck,9
And so it begins.,5
ABD century?,5

Woohoo now AB massacre loading,10
"Rishabh Pant has a SR of 227 between overs 16-20 since 2020, just second to AB.

Seems like there was a plan not to bat between these overs this year. 5D chess by Rishabh.",29

If abd plays 20 overs 160 is guaranteed.,4
Dube trying to make it in Test squad with that s/r,3
"Even after captaining all these years, Koach still doesn't understand the basics. Never make major changes to your batting order in a highly pressurized knockout match. Also, why the hell did he open? They had spare openers in Finch and Moeen. smh",1

Please release ABD next season. Rcb will learn how to be independent and form a solid team and he would find a more deserving franchise.,8
Well bowled Rash!,1
Kohli is the highest paid cheerleader ever,24
At this rate the stadium is going to be practically full for the finals.,2
"If RCB can somehow get to 140, I think they win this",0
Ab carrying rcb as always,7
AB is RCB....,8
AB can easily get 80 off the last 5,3
Soooo it begins!! The nightnare for some and the dream for some,-1
"We should try to get ABD next mega auction. Would be 38 by then, ideal age for a youngster to debut with us.",10
Honesty I am still super worried abt the game if ab is still on stike,2
Looks like only 1 will choke in playoffs not both Virat and ABD,1
ABD wicket crucial now...,1
Rashid is one of the best leggies in the shortest format in the world. Absolutely unmatched.,3
Match gonna turn upside down now,2
You fucking selector fuckers you did not pick rashid in LOI,2
"Dube must be the happiest man at Rashid's spell ending, he could not pick a single ball lol",2
"2 takeaways:

1. Natarajan is going to get clapped
2. Looks like spin isn't getting much assistance this match, rip to rcb for playing 4 spinners lmao",3
Moenn Ali diamond duck and that too on a free hit lmaoooo,6
"Ab in the death, srh fans close your eyes",2
"Wait you can play out Rashid without giving him a wicket.

*Sad DC noises*",5
Not sure the exact number but its like 11 matches out of 15 that Rashid’s gone for less than 25 runs in his spell. Just ridiculous.,2
Would pay shitload of money to watch peak Sachin bat vs Rashid Khan.,2
Next 5 going for 70. SRH death bowling isn't that good,2
"Let's say, ABD plays all the way.  150+ Possible ?",2

Kohli to remain unsold next season after RCB release him,1
I want RCB to lose just because of what their fans did in their Tamte song about CSK. 😐,-4
"Awful awful, plain awful.😖😖😖",1
Terrible day for Rashid,-1
Excuse me why am I hearing Dance Monkey?? I thought we'd all silently agreed to let that song die,1
Why does Kohli keep shitting the bed in big knockout games?,0
Srh fans still acting like their team is losing lol,6

Looks like srh would be the next finalist I guess.,1
Koach should have sent Sundar,1
"5 overs .... 100 runs 
Target : 194 
Am I asking too much ?",2
RCB need a 18-25 run over.,2
Man I am anxious,2
Pace comes in and ABD siwtching to 360 soon,2
RCB needs overs from right arm quick bowler Kohli today,3
Without Abd RCB would have been bowled out <100 a lot many times,5
Defence almost to the boundary lol,2
So AB is supposed to keep after this?,2
I have seen better edited porn compilations than that thumbs up ad.,1
"AB vs Holder, what could go wrong? /s",1
100 of last 5 overs. Let's go RCB!!,2
"The Thums Up ad with Ranveer makes no sense.  
  
Leave the archaeological artifact for the soft drink? No Indiana Jones wannabe would ever do that",3
Only Lord Pollard can get Abd out now,1
Sandy taking ABD out is gonna be my wet dream for today.,1
Either Hyderabad doesn't have good internet connection or RCB fans are really optimistic as always. About that 55-45 chances of who will qualify lmao,5
"Dube doesn’t look like he belongs at this level, hasn’t played one good game all season",1
saha not playing is a massive blow for srh. he is as crucial to srh fortunes as rashid young khan.,6
"Abd, please not today",6
atleast 40 runs needed off last 5 to lose in a dignified way,4
Im getting ptsd,2
Looks like they will get to 170 with AB around.,-1
Holder bowling to AB I don't wanna watch,2
Damn what a beauty ball,1
I just wanna see de Villiers lift a trophy man.,3
Proper litmus test here to see if Holder has really upgraded. So far real good with them yorkers,2
Holder vs AB? Fastest ODI 100 flashbacks.,7
[removed],5
ABD against a West Indian bowler in the end over is a scary proposition.,4
no wickets for rashid today,0
How do RCB fans survive this. It's honestly depressing thinking about the potential this team showed in the first half and the form just jumped off the cliff in the past 4-5 games.,5
"holder has really exceeded my expectations this season, didnt think he was a good T20 bowler.",8
ABD carrying RCB since 2013(?),8
AB vs Holder at Wanderers 2015 flashbacks,5
Just get Abd you fucking morons.,2
This is some ultra CSK level shit,5
They are good to get 160 from here which is a defendable total.,2
[removed],5
C'mon Dube show us some ugly slogs,2
That was a ducking good yorker by Holder,4
Is the pitch really helping the spinners or did rcb fuck up,6
Holder has been on point with his bowling today.,5
Snooze fest !,1
"I think we will need a change in ownership Delhi style. 

Completely change everything up.",6
[deleted],7
holder is good?,3
Holder might win one of test matches in NZ you never know he's in so good form ❤️,6
Holder has put so much work to bowl in LOIs. massive respect. so many variations and extremely accurate.,10
Is Saha made of glass ? Every other match he is injured for srh or for india . I guess keeping in all the low and slow wickets over the last 15-20 years has broken his back,6
"Rashid should be one of the most paid players in IPL, if he isn't. Guy is such a gem.",6
180 incoming,2
"So happy for Jason holder though stuck with his national team during time of crisis and board tussle.

Priyam Garg has been really good on the field.,6
Priyam Garg should open with Warner today,0
wtf is that commentator talking about,-1

Will ABD's brilliance raise RCB out of the mess they put themselves in? Has done it twice..,3
"RCB fans jinx their team <=> Team jinxes them back

They'll need Dube to turn it up too,2
Neckbeard Nataraj,3
This guy is a giant,1
Is any indian batsmen thats going to Australia in form?,2
I swear all my Tamil friends attempt to replicate Sandeep Sharma’s look 👀,4
Rookie bowling from Srh. Learn from Pollard and bowl some pies. Abd gets out to extremely bad balls because he doesn't expect a bowler to be that bad but he thrashes the good ones,6
Is that a wide? It looked within the line,0
"It's insane how well SRH have adapted to the various injury problems they have faced. SRH fans thought it was over for them when Bhuvi was injured but they bounced back, before this match people thought they were done with Saha gone but they've bounced back. I'm backing them to go all the way against the goliath that is MI.",9
AB is going to fuck us up if we don't get him out.,2
150 is still very possible if AB is out there. Need his wicket asap,2
ABD should ask for a pay raise. RCB is getting 2-3 batsmen worth of value from him.,9
AB turned Jason Holder's 5 overs 9 runs 1 wicket into 10 overs 104 runs 1 wicket in that 2015 WC game...,7
140-150 can be a good target for SRH's paper-thin batting if Warner is out early.,0
Why do players wear capes even at night matches.,1
Thank god dube is out.,4
He doesn't want to walk lol,5
Dube what an inning,6
Best way RCB management can thank AB for his contribution and loyalty to RCB is by making him the captain and buying him a decent team by selling Kolhi. It's probably in the best interest of both RCB and Kolhi.,12
DUBE DUBE RAHTAA HU......,7
"2020 can bring countries to a stop, burn down continents but it aint got nothing on us",16
I think srh has made a mistake here. Should have kept 1 over of Rashid. Abd is great against pace.,0
Holder and 3 wickets. Lucky number,3
A n o t h e r o n e,2

Brilliant innings by Dube comes to an end!,6
Good riddance,4

How did Dube 💩 made team India,5
"We need to get AB, guys.",5
My homie Holder,3
AB has to play holder first to do some damage. Again why tf is Dube still in the team?,1
C'mon start swinging dammit,1
dube mf all you had to do was give AB the strike,9
"What a fucking shit team rcb is. Abd please leave them lol. This is coming from an rcb ""supporter"" btw.",10
I thought it's abd but it's dube mannn,5
Dube isn't even IPL class.. how he got into Indian team is a mystery no one can solve..,15
Holder 👌🏿,11
Dube got screwed without lube,15
Finally we got a strike bowler. Well-done Holder,6
holder is an absolute bargain. he might be better than micth marsh lmao,11
absolute 'tube' innings from dube,3
Doesn't matter how much fodder you get until you get ABD.,7
Imagine RCB if they had hung on to the young indian batsmen they had on their books :'(,2
"Shivam Dube looks like Tarzan, bats like Mowgli.",11

Holder too bouncy for you RCB boys,3
Dube absolutely useless all year.,2
what a day for RCB to pull off an RCB special,6
Why doesn't Rashid get as many wickets as compared to Bumrah or Rabada?,2
"If cameraman zoom enough, you can see kohli is crying. Poor kohli.",2
Now i know why AB has back pains....,8
Depressed Koach looks like a sad puppy. I feel bad for him.,7
"**15.4** Holder to Dube, OUT,  **99-5**

Udana would’ve done really well on this pitch,5

I've never seen a more useless player than Shivam Dube.. my God he's shite.,8
Thank you RCB for letting us have Holder over Marsh,3

tactical wicket by RCB. Welcome to party Washington DC.,1
👌 wickets for Holder.,1
Why is holder showing 3,0
dube acting like he missed out on a century. how in the world did this guy get into indian team!?,4
What a terrible fucking innings by Dube. Chullu bhar paani me Dube jao bc.,2
Now watch Siraj and Saini keep bowling faster and faster to finish RCB's hopes of defending 126 in the second half,10
"Such a slow pitch, watch Saini bowl every ball at 149 kmph with 2 beamers sprinkled in.",13
ABD to srh: jyada gand na fulao bhosdike cha mod denge tumhari,1
I can't imagine how itchy that neckbeard must be.,5
Ab go to another team and vk you please retire from ipl,3

"I think now it's safe to say that DC and RCB over-performed in the group stages. Going by their current form, even an ailing CSK might beat these 2.",10
Idk what RCB were thinking with their batting lineup today- so weak,3
Holder used lube to fuck Dube,3
SRH fans reverse jinxing non-stop to get ABD's wicket!,9
Can't blame Dube. The downer hit him after last night. Must have snorted 5-6 lines.,6
"As a West Indian, the Windies management is shit and has been for years. Recently with Phil Simmons back in the fold it’s gotten better, but there’s still a lot to be done.",6
Someone should tell Holder that [the OK gesture he uses as a celebration has been co-opted by neo-nazis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/ok-sign-gesture-emoji-rightwing-alt-right).,1
A good 8(13) holding one end ...innings from Dube.,7
Is Dube in the India vs Aus series?,1
Holder 13 wickets in 5 matches ? Wow,7
SRH is the only team that deserves to play in the finals and the only team that can beat MI.,5
"RCB are such a weird team. 

They don't really play attacking cricket but still keep losing wickets. 

They depend on AB de Villiers who acts as both the accumulator and the big hitter. 

Why the hell do I support them? (ABD of course)",20
"After this match, that RCB party on the yatch is gonna look real bad",15
Holder has been clutch as fuck for us this season. Really turned around SRH's campaign.,12
abd next ambassador for moov from all the backpain carrying rcb all these years.,9
VK said the bio bubble thing is a bit harsh maybe that's what is affecting his performance?,0
AB will give himself to MI for 0.2 cr just for a trophy.,10
Mumbai in this situation and we'd still be talking about 150. Yeah they're too OP.,3
"Jason Holder is very effective on two paced wickets. Uses his height and changes in pace very effectively.  
As long as he can chip in with a 20 odd occasionally he should deffo be in the Windies T20 team",3
"Happy for SRH and sad for RCB, seeing virat sitting lonely in dugout with head hanging down. Rarely we see this kind of Virat. He likes to keep chin up even in losses, his whole body language is down.",1
This is ridiculous from YRKFA. Ending up with 0 wickets in the play-off match. All that hype for nothing. Disgusting performance I must say.,0
"Jason Holder is such a smart bowler

I wish our bowlers had some brains",6
"Holder has been so good I almost forgot we have a world class T20 all rounder on the bench - Nabi! 

If the Indian young players start performing this looks like a great team",3
"Kohli gets Gurkeerat in team

r/cricket: What a shit show, Dube is so better

Kohli gets Dube in

r/cricket: What a shit show",41
"Man why can't these RCB batsman just rotate strike and let AB play it? Dube got out while trying to hit for a single. How bad is the batting line when one can't even rotate strike.

Maybe its my stupid rcb optimism. But i still feel theres a chance,2
Who is this nags ? Team owner ? Is that his real voice ?,0
"Man, even Abd will get a slipped disc now",2
Remember Holder was unsold,6

"Shivam Dube is no budget Pandya, he is lucky if he is mentioned as a budget Vijay Shankar.",9
"Dube isn't international class, nor IPL class

He isn't even Dream 11 class ffs",6
Seeing Koach so sad is just sad 😞,5
And to think this guy played internationals for India. Even Rajat Bhatia is better than this shit.,3
Saini gonna bowl a couple of beamers today and blame it on the dew,7
"Only AB stayed sober during RCB party. The rest knew they were going to get hammered anyway in the match. So, they got hammered in advance.",10
"It seems no one other than DDP, ABD, and VK wants to play at the crease. What hurry are they in?",5
RCB is that friend who shits the bed even worse and make us feel alive once more. Thank you from DC.,8

Just get Abd plox.. 🙏🏻,1
The Josh app ads getting so cringy day by day,3
RCB should give a chance to Nags at the crease. Maybe he can play better.,8
Times like this I'm jealous of Mumbais batting lineup,2
when did Holder become a good T20 bowler :D. I vividly remember the pasting he got from ABD in South Africa,2
"Tv producers are like quick get the ads in, we might not go 20 overs here",8
"We tried our best... I would like to thank our supporters for backing us through out the tournament... We will come back harder next season...
And the cycle continues...",2
"The Vimal Zubaan Kesari ads work so well because even though Ajay Devgan is a star, you can believe that he ....occasionally chews Vimal.   
  
Give the marketing team and advertising firm a raise",2
Srh is just an under looked team that there were no srh players in jio dhan dhana dhan add before.,5
RCB on paper bats deep....,5
In B4 ABD will eat Sandeep alive in the next over,5
"Lot of people saying only SRH deserves to be in the Finals, rightly so but discarding how well DC and RCB played at the start of the tournament is extremely harsh. They have played shit afterwards but at the start SRH wasnt performing well either",9

Fuck ya AB,-2
Kohli = 17cr. No need to feel sorry for this arrogant cunt just because he looks sad.,4
Anything above 150 and it will be difficult for srh,3
"If I was AB I'd leave, he owes us nothing at this point, in fact we owe him a lot. He's not got too many playing years left, and he deserves to win the ipl atleast once.",8

Just remembered about AB's onslaught against Holder in the 2015 WC and I'm kinda scared.,1
Not a brilliant 50 as per his standards but in the context of the game it's huge.. The lone fighter as usual is fighting on and on... You deserved a better team ABD...,2
ABD has literally hit half of the total at this point....one man show,2
"Akash Chopra calls AB De Villiers one-man army.

*Wild Koach noises*",3
"I swear ABD just finds most games too boring, but then decides to go Super Saiyan when everything's going to shit.   


What a player!",3
"As long as ABD is out there, I can’t tell what is a good score and what isn’t.",8
Thank you AB 😊 you're the one person we can always trust,6
ABD hard carrying RCB,3
"If they can get 20 per over, they would get 184",1
"Once again, we stand with our hands folded in front of ABD and beg him",8
"Giving me GL VS RCB 2016 PLAYOFF 1 VIBES , WE ARE *FUCKED*",2
How ABD can find it game after game to put the team on his back and give them something to fight for is incredible. This man is truly a legend. Great fifty.,6
can abd give SRH a respectable score to chase?,3
All rcb fans should contribute to build an Abd monument outside Chinnaswamy,11
Koach - RCBs best cheerleader,4
"RCB scraps through 150 with AB masterclass due to slow pitch

SRH comes roaring and scores it in 15 overs.",8
Where's the panic button bois,4
Why can't RCb make AB captain. I don't think kohli will be pissed with that decision,4
Ab literally scored half the runs on the score board.,2
Kohli must’ve opened because he thought he’d do well on this slow pitch🤡,6
KohliOut should be the new WengerOut,3
Man how much I'd love to see AB in a SRH uniform next year,2
This sucker abd is still here,3
Nadeem and Holder are two guys I am very happy for this season,2
Man ABD has done everything he could to drag them this far. No dew so far that's encouraging,3
can zampa bat?,1
Kohli better include AB's children in his property papers....That is how much he owes him,12
Was the pitch bad or do we just suck?,5
"*Shows Dube - This is Hosh

*Shows Abd - This is Josh",7
I fear ABD storm and RCB probably ending up with 160-170,1
Dorime. 🙏🏻,6
"Would be scenes If Virat in post match goes: "" You know what I played shit I really did I got out to Holder fucking holder just YouTube my cover drive 4 to his bowling in my last WI tour I killed it, Yes I am to blame but you know what I am gonna come hard on Aussies now like really hard so hard even you'll feel it sitting at your home, just fucking wait""",23
imagine getting paid 17crs to disappoint every season from 2016 onwards,8
We suck during death overs,4
"Fitness is not the be all end all of cricket. Koach needs to understand that.  
You need to look decently fit to be a modern sportsman. Rohit needs to understand that",8
RCB are just wasting Sunder man... He is an opener ffs.,7
"Forgot Dhoni, ABD needs to have a biopic on his life",20
just send abd to MI and let him win a cup or something. I'm sure they'll be happy to take him,11
Abd strike please sundar.,3
So holder is the new Ben cutting for rcb?,9
4 overs 60 and we can at least fight,7
It is shame AB never won IPL or world cup. He deserve one.,10
Where the fuck is Mr. Nags? Give him some batting time man. He will score some Unacademy cracking SIXES With his inflate deflate strategy.,8
Just give strike to AB,7
Just give him the strike please.,3
Oh no possibly another one sided match. Anyway,2
Abd must be a masochist to continue to serve for Rcb loyally for years and years,5
"Guys, Kohli will never let AB go. And the mindless, gutless franchise owners will never let Kohli go. Only hope is that Kohli retires and Bangalore finally win an IPL.",8
"140 minimum to be competitive from here. 160 could be par, with the dew to come and no Morris.",2
"Holder as been game changer for SRH 

imagine bairstow headbutting him after the match.",3
Bkl Mumbai ko dekho har season mein perform krti hai. Idhar ye dinbhar video game khelte hai aur padhai mein anda,5
"vIrat ChoKER In KnoCkOUTs 

The last time RCB were in knock-out, he did pretty well",4
Sandeep has really shiny hair!,3
"If ABD and batdeep RCB are struggling on this pitch, imagine our middle order batting here lol",4
"Abd should be the captain of ""I deserve better franchise"" XI

Make archer the vc",13
They could have tried with parthiv today .,2
"Seriously though, the answer is staring RCB in the face, if they care more about winning than marketing.  


Ditch Kohli and invest that money into 2/3 young domestic indian batsmen",10
Can RCB just leave AB please? Y'all dont deserve him and I can go on to support any team who gets him.,15
[deleted],3
ABD carrying this innings like Stoinis did yesterday.,3
Yo Bitches! I'm back! Go SRH Go!,4
We have all heard the fairytale where Prince Charming rescues the Princess in the castle. ABD is that prince and Koach is that princess.,9
LET ABD BAT MAXIMUM BALLS YOU DOOFUS,2
BC strike de ABD ko,2
Kohli might just resign from captaincy,3
"AB in playoffs

68

today 50\*",10
Holder has assumed the mantle of Khaleel by taking wickets on shit deliveries,5
SRH really need to do well to keep RCB under 150,2
This thread is the equivalent of r/politics for cricket. Y'all live in your own bubble.,8
Just get AB on strike,1
"Who is ""Koach""? I'm OOTL",1
Does anyone know if SRH can retain Holder since he is a replacement player?,9
"RCB in league stages : Strong doggie

RCB in playoffs : weak doggie",2
Counting on a South African in knockouts is the worst feeling ever ngl,7
Y'all complaining about us reverse jinxing just give us ABD wicket.,7
Should really build a statue of Abd outside chinnaswamy at this point now.,9
"Troubled times in ~~US~~ RCB

Abraham Benjamin and Washington: Shieeettt",10
"Sundar is a god in disguise , thanks for not giving ab strike lol",6
My theory is that till virat kohli is in RCB we ain't winning any cups smh,11
Anything above 120 is an improvement,9
AB is a cheat code,2
Any fellow CSK fans who wants SRH to win today?😂,-1
135 can be a fighting score,3
Zampa better take 6 wickets today,9
"Death, taxes and RCB fucking it",9
AB could've gone a few more years in international cricket. I think he was almost forced to retire because of the whole choosing when to play drama.,12
Reminder that after finch got out the projected score was 100... I feel bad for ABD he deserves better,8
Rashid takes two kicks before chucking the ball,1
RCB playing Sandeep like Archer.,5
sundar is an opener,5
We have qualified after 3 years it is good enough for me with this squad,9
"Assuming RCB is gonna crash out tonight and we wont see more of them later, I hope Kohli gets his pre 2019 form back in Australia. Even the 2011-2014 Kohli was better than the Kohli we have now, forget about the 2016-2018 Kohli.",6
Was Saha dropped because of injury?,8
I'm legit so afraid that ABD is gonna rip us apart,9
Feeling bad for ABD. Don't care about Kohli though,17
Has a team ever played with only 2 pacers and 4 proper spinners,3
Nice Sandy,5
Mate Sandeep restricted AB to a 7 run 17th over. Wow.,3
Good over,2
"RCB batsmen to ABD: ye aap karo, hum Dream11 pe team banate hai...",12
"Ab: Guys I pulled off a miracle for us today but you can't always depend on me alri-
RCB: Ok now do it again",7
ABD bout to have a broken back after carrying RCB the entire season,4
Damn ABD gonna have a shoulder injury with all that weight of expectations,5
Gentle remainder: Saha was dropped due to injury,7
3 overs and 50 runs would get RCB to a good position.,2
3 overs 40+ runs please,2
Take him out now,1
Someone needs to put up a mental health support thread for RCB fans for real.,6
why are u keeping ABD off strike chutyaas,2
2 Nattu overs are going to be run feast.,0
ABD's hair loss can be easily explained by the kind of shit RCB makes him go through,10
Can we get a preemptive f in the chat of Natarajan?,0
"No wicket for Sandeep and Rashid :(, but Holder might compensate on their behalf.",1
What did Jaqueline do to her face :(,3
Please abd go ballistic,3
Great over by Sandeep. The commentators kept stressing that this was a big over opportunity. He handled it pretty well.,2
Nattu still has 2 more overs left,4
"Ah my,  abd not worrying about strikes is the proof that he is playing ultimately selfless.....",5
No Jacqueline! It's still day 6!,5
I don't 'mind' virat kohli....take his fucking dick out of your mouths and commentate fairly ffs.,7
If Koach wins the election he will Make Washington Sundar Again.,6
How tf is his name Washington but surname Sundar?,1
"If you are watching a match with the bois ,cursing while pointing at TV is compulsory",3
"This is why Sandeep is not the same as PK or any other Indian bowler who is only effective with the new ball. 

He actually has taken his death bowling up a notch since moving to SRH. He is improving by the day. Gun bowler.",8
Feel for nattu :(,3
"3 overs. 30 runs will get them to 141. With ab there it can reach 150+, but only if he's there.",3
" I’m still always scared when Sandeep bowls. At his pace and given what Watson did to him in 2018, it’s great to see how well he has done.",3
"Come on, AB. Picture Holder in his West Indies jersey. Picture yourself in the pink SA one.",14
"SRH is chase is basically hinged on David Warner staying on the crease long. 

Otherwise even 130 has shown to be hard for that team",5
Nattu will be targeted by AB,6
Virat was never there for RCB in crucial time 3 finals 1 eliminator on those all occasions he failed,5
Another reason why every team needs a Hardik Pandya,11
SRH are bowling really well. No looseners,8
"After so many potential competitors, RCB make a late comeback to regain the title of meme team.",12
Sundar is an opener for his domestic team right? Any reason why he's a finisher in IPL/Indian team?,5
AbD is just waiting for Natarajans missed Yorkers...,4
Peak KKR under Gambhir's captaincy would play 4 spinners. Atleast they use to play in Eden Gardens....why tf would Kohli do this now,9
What's worse? Not qualifying or loosing in Eliminator 1?,24
111 strikes,6
Sundar gifting his wicket,5
"Safe catch, GG Nattu",9
Nelson strikes again....,3
Heck yaaaa,1
Such a good shot and straight to fielder.. such rotten luck.,12
kohli looks sad af,7
Nice but AB is still there.,4
"Fuckers, give abd some support, you incompetent buffoons.",9
ABD - Fine I'll do it myself,7
Natarajan gets Washington again,5
watch as warner starts hitting 15 an over,12
Can I get any harder?,8
Fuck everyone except ABD,10
Everyone gets out instead of ab,6
No Washi you give AB the strike,2
Finally Nattu gets a. Wicket,8
You had one job Sundar. GIVE THE STRIKE TO ABD,6
"Always remember  
Grab your LUND  
When its 111",6
"Everytime an RCB batsman lofts the ball, it goes into someone’s hands. Wtf. Why can’t they find gaps",8
Catch practice,4
छछूंदर GONE🐀,1
Samad taking 2 catches... Ummm,7
"**17.1** Natarajan to Washington Sundar, OUT, **steered straight to sweeper cover.** **111-6**

Washington Sundar c Abdul Samad b Natarajan 5 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33",4
"AB watching that kohllapse around him and thinking ""what is new""",17
Siraj Saini Chahal and Zampa at 8-11 LOLOL,2
"Literally everything is going to the fielders, what the actual fuck",4
Why is AB running 2s when he should be keeping strike.....,5
Chalo dugout boys ko vannakam,7
Red Team not looking so hot in 2 contests.,7
Our lower order is one of the worst in history of IPL,6
Udana and Philippe was shit to be honest. You can't blame the management for that,3
Being AB is suffering,7
Bc isse acha Parthiv patel ko ek match khila lete chutiyo,7
RCB making sure that ABD stays not out. 5D chess.,6
"Every since RCB have changed their Jersey to Red & Black, they have been shit.",2
'Vanakkam' and 'Nandri' the only Tamil words the Dugout knows,4
SRH have won the match with 10 wickets,3
[deleted],7
Unless we get ABD I can't breathe a sigh of relief,3
Nandri Vanakam,4
"*RCB all set to lose yet another playoffs*

Oh no, anyway",3
Natarajan for the worst facial hair award this IPL?,7
This innings basically summerizes all RCB's weaknesses,4
Why Saini over Zampa?,2
You go SRH 🧡🧡,4
"Wait, Kohli really promoted himself to open only to go out for 6...nice.",8
"Dominic cork- Now RCB is under pressure..

No, they were under pressure since Kohli got out..",4
Fucking dumbass. Can't give strike to AB,2
"130+ and it is RCB's game to lose. Warner struggles early against off spin, Saha isn't playing, Pandey struggles in rotating strike against spin, Williamson's not in his best form ATM and the rest are shit.",-2
Atleast leave someone for AB to bat with. You can't depend on him to take you to the total you want when there's no wickets left.,3
Koach is way too hard on his players if they have one bad innings/spell. This is common in T20 since the match swings rapidly and he should realise that. Definitely a reason why Kohli is not successful as a captain in RCB.,6
At least RCB qualified.. good enough for me,3
Nataraj's bowling is as sharp as a pencil's tip.,3
"Finally, somebody times a shot well. And guess what, it goes straight to the boundary fielder. Fuck.",4
All Sundar had to do was turn over the strike...everyone wants to be a hero like AbD with none of the talent..,1
SRH : Who needs ABD's wicket anyway? Get the remaining 10 out!,8
ABD: Aa gaye meri maut ka tamasha dekhne,5
This Natarajan really needs to learn how to wear his mask correctly /s,5
"Samad is a natural ball attractor.  
  
His daily life must be terrible. Randomly standing on the street and then boom! balls flying towards the face",6
That's very good field placement. Sundar played a good shot to that ball,3
"Normally people saying Abd carries the team is a slight exaggeration but today it is literally, 100% the case",3
"Question: if sundar was not  ""handy"" with the bat would he still have been selected in the indian team over proper traditional spinners?",5
Worthless fucking batsmen,3
[deleted],2
Holder has played 5 matches and already has 13 fucking wickets. I have not saw a change midway which has single handedly transformed a team more,6
Hogg the strike now!!,1
Why is everyone trying to Yeet the ball themselves instead of letting Abd do it,5
"So not only does AB have to not get out, he has to keep strike and score at a strike rate of 200+.",8
AB just has to go big. If last 4 matches fo RCB are any indication 140-150 is not gonna do the job,3
Washington.exe has stopped working. Makes sense considering what is happening in US,17
"Sundar is a decent bat but he is not a slogger, he is an accumulator.",4
I would’ve liked to see Umesh bat here lmao,6
at least our suffering will end today,9
SRH fans coming out of the woods,3
I like RCB fans. They can take jokes very well.,11
"Most LOL moments of this IPL:

1) Jadhav 7*(12)

2) Moeen getting out on a freehit.

Feel free to add stuff to this",68
"It's about time ABD is made captain instead of Koach. Dont get me wrong, Koach is a wonderful batsman but he has failed as a captain atleast in IPL",9
Why are they hyping Samad as a fielder? He's probably the worst fielder I've seen this IPL lol,2
I want bevarsi kudka on the field. He can't do worse than these clowns.,6
"Saini at 8 ...batting too high or not ?
Nevermind ...forgot they are playing zampa today.",3
Pain,2
Is there no Morris today?,2
"Yall have already scored 110 , thats enough to beat us without saha",4
Phewwww,2
Natarajan nearly touched 140 (139.8) in that last ball. It’s just that he’s already 29. If he was 21 he probably would’ve been on the flight to Australia as a regular member and not as an extra bowler. He could’ve seriously increased his pace. A little unlucky.,7
Fuck. Didn’t carry.,2
"Natrajan take remaining 4 wickets, I’ll myself fly down to Dubai and give you a nice shave.",8
"I didnt know parthiv was in the team, really brain dead to not play him",5
[deleted],1
KKR fans had to sit out only to watch this shit,8
Bad luck.,1
Natarajan needs to learn how to be economical.,2
[deleted],4
"Saini, Chahal, Zampa, Siraj 

What the fuck is that tail",6
Why not zampa?,2
Why can't these ppl just rotate strike atleast? It's not that hard . Just give AB the strike godamm it,4
There is just no skill in RCB,1
Another wicket for Nelson,3
All out ABD onslaught now. No sense in giving strike to Saini,3
[https://gfycat.com/ComfortableBonyBlackfly](https://gfycat.com/ComfortableBonyBlackfly) AB at the other end watching these muppets,3
"The gap between Mumbai and other teams this ipl is huge ,nobody even comes close . I saw it happening only in 2003 WC",2
My throat got stuck for a sec,3
"It's not THAT they're losing, it's HOW they're losing. Pathetic. 2020 CSK would've put up more fight",3
What's the rationale behind picking Abdul Samad over Abhishek Sharma? Isn't Abhishek a better hitter of the ball? I remember his 16 or 19 ball 46 against RCB when he was 17.,4
P A I N,1
All out ABD onslaught now. No sense in giving strike to Saini,1
Pls give AB strike!,3
Saini batting at 8 lmao,2
AB needs to keep strike now,1
STOP THE ~~COUNTS~~ Wickets,4
"The word ""undeserving"" doesn't go along much with sports teams but I'm beginning to realise that RCB are almost there to be called undeserving.",1
On other news: AB de Villiers confirms visit to the chiropractor after carrying RCB batting every game....,6
Keep saini on strike boyyy,2
"If this was gully cricket, they would have allowed single batting to RCB.",10
Get to 126 and bowl like punjab easy 😌,7
Siraj with his swing and Sundar with two lefties opening to open the bowling surely. Saini at first change. Simple and attacking,2
AB shouldn't take single now,2
"Any of CSK, Punjab, KKR, RR would’ve played better today",5
Sqini doing better than dube lol,3
Saini can bat,2
"As much as I rate ABD highly , not sure why he keeps taking singles at this juncture",7
Not *that* embarrassed of RR watching this team tbh,4

Hope Final can cover it up.",9
I say it again and again: don't be bummed that your team didn't make it. Be glad that Indian cricket has produced such gems in T20 cricket.,12

RCB and DC wasted 2 playoff spots. KXIP and KKR/RR would’ve been more deserving. RCB more so but we’re terrible too. Both deserve the L.,12
If only they can get to 126.,5
Atleast they will get over 120 this time. That's a big plus,2

RCB was almost being carried by ABD's brilliance in many matches./ He is also aging. Their foreign players are possibly only better than KXIP. They also have too many bits and pieces all round players in the middle order. When it comes off it seems like the most balanced side but when it doesnt it seems like a shit team. They need to get some good young Indian bats to complement the top order. Although their Indian contingent isnt that bad frankly.,3
he knows nattu won't bowl anything but yorkers so clever shot lmao,6

I was sat at home shitposting on r/cricket

Gavaskar: RCB is kill

Me: Noooo!",17
Siraj with his helicopter shot,4
"It might be stupid,but I still have hope that R b can pull this off. I mean they did manage to bottle a chase of 126 vs kxip,but then again they beat Mi by 10 wickets. Just an optimistic Rcb fan",7
and now I'd like to see Koach dropping catches loll,12
"Saini and Siraj scored more than Kohli, lmao who would've thought",11
Just wait for a spin bowling masterclass from rcb,7

"Okay someone said earlier that if RCB reach 130, they win. And here we are.",7
For those of you wondering how rcb won 7 matches.- abd scored 50 in 4 of them . Siraj wonder in 1 match and vk wonder in 1 match. And rr played shit in one match.,17

RCB need to have a powerplay like MI did yesterday to defend this with Warner getting out for a duck!,3
"KKR fans, whom are you supporting tonight - as well as in the playoffs?",2
A player who is retired from intl cricket for almost 2yrs now is the best player in ur team.. While the rest of the others are doing absolutely nothing.. That's shameful..,8

[deleted],4
Well I had no hopes from RCB and I am still disappointed.,1
69 runs short kinda game.,5
The only way to win this now is to get Warner in first over. 80-20 in favor of SRH atm.,3
Ponting better beat his pupils into shape or else SRH are gonna devour them.,7
Siraj and Saini >> Kohli and ABD,0
These bowlers are ensuring they get a decent total to defend because the batsmen are not gonna help them bowl.,7

"Dude, if only any of Kohli, Padikkal, Finch or Dube had contributed only a bit more and batted sensibly, they could've scored 20 runs more at least which was good on this pitch. And no I'm not Kohli speaking.",12
zampa and yuzi will be absolutely critical this match... I still remember how Kings 11 defending smaller total,5
WTF Siraj coming in at 9 is 3rd highest scorer.,10
If RCB wins this then 2020 is cursed,10
Watch Siraj run through the SRH top order,6

Well bowled SRH. It's an on par score for SRH batting though.  A nice little cameo by the tail-enders.,4
"RCB: Not an easy pitch to bat on and we have 4 spinners.  
  
Dew: Haha water go brrrrrrrr",8
Saini and Siraj adding few runs so that they can leak those runs during bowling,4
Why would you bowl yorkers to tailenders.,-1
One of the positives for RCB this tournament has been DDP. He was a great find and with more experience he will be an even better player,3
130 odd is in  SRH collapse range but they won't because Warner and Saha will chase it down with their Big Dick whips off the backfoot. Interesting to see what RCB's spin heavy attack does.,4
"KKR, you had to Bowl cummins 4th over in the first match against RR

Tom fucking curran scored 53, UNADKAT SCORED 15!!!!",5
now they need the 15 minute break to swap out the bowler friendly wicket and spray dew on the field. Ably assisted by legstump half volleys from saini at 150k. An RCB fan's life is quite predictable.,12
"Abd should just leave rcb. Go to another team and win trophies. It just won't happen here. 

PS : Coming from an Rcb fan",7
Siraj showed intent to fuck over his former team. It's over for SRH,6

Fiz to Rusell or Nattu to AB",2
I’m ready for the Koach we were “X” amount of runs short TM speech,7
Warner comes in scores 10 a over in powerplay then a bit slow down and finally holder will score quick 25 off 10 for the win,1
Moeen in place of udana was a stupid decision even before the duck.,3
Kochi Tuskers will win IPL before RCB,11
So what say we boys? SRH's game to lose or does RCB have a good chance of winning?,3
They probably get to 150 minimum if Moeen doesn't get run out,3

"Tottenham is nothing like RCB. Nobody looks at Tottenham and goes ""Yeah they'll win something"". They're always the dark horse. And at any rate, they're a big club but they've reached that status by punching above their weight, when you compare them to their competitors. RCB is a perpetual underachiever.  
 
Comparing those two is slanderous to Spurs and just plain incorrect.",9

Are you going to stick with Phillipe or not? You gave Finch a long run, dropped him, and are bringing him back in an eliminator. Kohli opens first time this season. Finch plays at 3. Ali has been in and out of the team and is now tasked with batting in the middle order. 

What is going on? RCB have like 1302827293 coaches and 2 head coaches to buck against head case decisions that Kohli is prone to. This is a failure of epic proportions. This billion dollar batting line up is better than 131 against a Bhuvi less SRH.

Alright RCB let's see some fight and scrap. Kohli get your ass even more fired up and show some desperation,2
"Without Vijay Shankar, this game is SRH's to lose.",1
Goswami do it for Goswami! Time to show solidarity,2
"I'm sorry guys I'm gonna remove my flair, i had no hope but somehow this is too much for me",3
This season was worse because they gave me hope 😭,5
Siraj already eating the runs he made,1
"I was really disappointed when Mitch Marsh got injured, as I had expected big things from him. Looking back i can't really have expected him to have done much better than Holder, especially with the ball. I'd have to say the WI captain will be a key player in the IPL going forward.",6
"Finally, Kohli got Siraj to bowl with the new ball after sucking Morris cock",3
Fun fact: Goswami was the emerging player of the season in 2008 and he played for RCB..,5
Siraj gonna do a 3-8. I have a feeling,2
[deleted],3
Come on Zlatan Sirajovic,9
"Siraj dude, that hair! Can’t unsee that abomination",5
I am already ready for Iyer’s post match presentation “SRH is a strong team with Rashid in the middle overs and we could do fuck all”,5
Honestly KKR and KXIP are better than RCb,1
">STOP THE RUN-COUNT! STOP THE FRAUD! ANY RUNS SCORED AFTER 9:30 IST SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED. WE'RE WINNING BIG #PLAY_BOLD

**-Virat Kohli's Twitter(à la Donald Trump)**",42
Why isn't Saha playing ?,3
Is Siraj wearing sunscreen at night lol,5
A bit of inexperience in middle order.,1
"If RCB can take SRH to 17 overs, they can reach play....oh wait, thats over isnt it?",14
"Knowing RCB, they will give goswami a 70\* this innings.",3
"Just play this over safely, after that siraj will win it for SRH",8
Lets gooo,4
Bhenchod.,5
Don't give me hope,18
Let's go,4
"Even in 2020, the strangest year, RCB cant win",2
Scream my heart scream.,9
HOLY FUCK,3
"When Saha was doing so well as an opener, no need to change what's working.",0
"Siraj has to be given more respect, he has to be used cleverly",7

Lol AB almost dropped it,1
We’re gonna see Tuk Tuk Warner now,2
Lord siraj you beauty,3
Wtfff goswami,2
Yo r/samespecies stuff with Holder and Goswami right there,3
One thing I definitely won't miss after the IPL is over are those cringey chants,8
Bruh,3
De Villiers is like Tatte phut gaye bc.,6
"SRH I dare yaa, I double dare yaaa ""don't make it interesting""",2
"""Saha replacement""",10
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO,2
Only Siraj celebrated that wicket. Rest of them know. Lmao,9
Remove kane and warner and game on!!,13
"Siraj strikes early

He's going to be deadly with the new ball",6
Lord siraj,5
GG RCB see you next year,10
No Go swamy,6
Yikes.,6
Saha..we miss you :(,5
how good is this fucker with the new ball,2
Go swamy,1
And let the shitshow begin.,3
"**0.4** Mohammed Siraj to Goswami, OUT,  **2-1**

SP Goswami c &dagger;de Villiers b Mohammed Siraj 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",1
Well at least he didn’t take up many balls,0
Excellent bowling from Bale,3
Get them Siraj,4
"Lord Siraj is baaack.

The Return of the King (kinda).",4
Saha 😣,5
Get Warner bitches and make this match fun,3
"Thanks Agent Goswami

Now do your job Agent Pandey",10
"KOHLI FUCKER, WHY TF COULDNT U USE SIRAJ WITH THE NEW BALL MORE OFTEN",6
"Man, really hope Siraj brings this form to Australia",3
Aww would have loved to see Goswami do good,3
Siraj needs to take a 5 for just for inflicting that hair upon us!,4
Collapse incoming?,1
"If we can’t chase it, screw this man, srh don’t deserve it",2
Let's go Siraj!!!,3
No headband Siraj today ;),2
I'm sorry rcb. Our teams don't deserve us. At all.,1
Come on RCB. Get Warner early.,2
Going to e a worrisome chase,1
Get Warner please,1
"LOL IF siraj gets like 4 wickets and wins this game for RCB

holy",6
"I for a moment thought he got Warner , with the way he was celebrating .",2
Poor Bairstow went from first choice to third choice keeper.,8
"Alright, nice game rcb, see yall next year",2
Suraj: From Meme to Seam. The untold story.,8
"Two things:

Siraj why the man bun?
Where is Saha?",6
"Finally, a former RCB player who doesnt do well against RCB.",9
"As I was saying 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jp3yo7/z/gbcthdl",1
"Why tf would you not play Saha??   


Come on SRH, don't become RCB!!",-7
"Its SRH's as long as Pandey, Warner and Kane are still there",2
I just wanna see siraj like this in australia with the red ball.,3
Too much to expect on Goswami's first game.,6
If SRH somehow manages to bottle this imagine the shitposting in qualifier 2,10
"Goswami they said, and he went back.",15
RCB winning today is our only hope to reach finals,3
I don't know what happened but Siraj has been different this IPL espeacially the second half.,1
Good Goswami would've shat against Mumbai anyway. We all know that right ;),6
[removed],-12
Siraj fifer incoming,3
Cursed ipl bro,2
Finally siraj gets to bowl with the new ball because kohli literally has no other option lol.,7
Is Saha injured?,5
"Ah man, Siraj is a beauty would love to see him in test",5
Agent Pandey in the house,4
KXIP v SRH pt 2? 😳😳,3
Lol people thought we were reverse jinxing when we said it's hard for us to reach 130. Good night Bois imma head out and save myself from some humiliation. Kxip match still haunts me,17
"So Koach wasn't using Siraj the proper way, it seems.",4
If Siraj could bowl that beautiful outswinger and remove that off stump of Pandey that would be nice.,7
It’s on,4
Saha is injured you idiots. Do you think SRH would drop him for no reason whatsoever when he was performing so well?,24
[deleted],-15
Goswami doing a favor for his U19 captain.,5
Unrelated but my Reddit mobile app keeps crashing ONLY when I press the edit option on my comments. Any solutions?,2
Hopefully Saha is well by next game....if we even make it,5
"🎵 *Pandey Ji, Pandey Ji, Come out and Smash!*🎵




If you know what song that is then I feel sorry for you.....


If you don't, then you lucky fucker",5
"Pandey either a 60(30) or a 19(26) 

Nothing in between",12
Tuk tuk Pandey please up the req run rate,6
I wasn't expecting any wickets for at least 10 more overs xD,2
"If Siraj wins this for RCB, the theme of 2020 being a confounding year will continue.",12
"C-Raj ❌

A-Raj ✅",7
"I just feel bad for goswami ,not fair on him to just come out and be expected to play in qualifiers , we just have the shittiest luck possible",13
Please bowl Sundar. Can't be giving the only other pacer for Warner to feed on with the new ball.,5
Siraj is seriously making a strong case for the test series.,13
Guys is it normal to panic SRH botching this chase?,3
Fcking karnataka teams... Always trouble us with 120/130 targets,10
Gotta get Warner out fast,6
Goswami has always been in Saha's shadow. He was Kohli's keeper in U19 but has been stuck at Bengal ever since. Why they played him over Jonny Bairstow makes no sense. Very poor decision by Warner.,-2
"Siraj from Hyderabad playing for RCB bowling to Pandey from Karnataka playing for SRH

Heh",16
" SRH I think you've misunderstood the meaning of ""to one-up""",5
These Josh ads,4

"Pandey, remember you are from Karnataka first, SRH is only for 2 months a year.",9
2 more wickets and our tail opens :(,8
"Even RCB-B defended 126 against SRH

No way the original RCB gonna let this go",10
"We have memed Suraj into performance this season, whos next",8
"Next years prediction:-

3.SRH

4.CSK

5. KKR

6.RR

7. DC

8. RCB",1
"Hopefully Saha returns by finals, SRH needs him for MI",2
Pandey crumbled last time the surface was hard to bat. What was he 15 off 29 vs Kings XI,3
"Warner has talked about how bad the punjab game was in every post match presentation since that game , i think he'd rather stop playing cricket than lose another game like that",10
Warner goes and this match could turn very interesting quickly,10
Playoffs ka maza hi kirkira kar diya dono chutiya teams ne.,-1
🔥🔥🔥🔥it’s fine🔥🔥🔥🔥,10
Why is Kohli not playing well? Is it because he's playing badly?,28
Wow Kohli is loud today,9
Shit Morris would've been useful here,5
Manish anna... Pl Run...,5
"Tbf SRH have had awful luck with injuries

Bhuvi out, Marsh out, Vijay Shankar out, Saha missing out for this game, Williamson was out for a few games",18
Lol I forgot about Zampa. It's over for SRH.,8
Siraj has learnt the power of the top knot from Ishant it seems. It's over for everyone else.,7
Pick Warner and things will become interesting. Need top level intensity from the team as a whole and not like that limp performance these guys put up against DC a few days back.,1
SRH collapse at the hands of Lord Siraj. Seriously though if Siraj is used as Sandeep Sharma is at SRH he can be a decent bowler rather than a death overs specialist which gifts runs to batsmen.,7
"Nice to see Zampa though, I missed my gf",20
Tuk Tuk is in the house,5
I love the intensity in the field tho,10
Any dew so far?,2
"Sometimes I just think we should bat first regardless, I trust our bowling a lot more than our batting",3
"Kohli channeling his inner Dilliwala, love it",11
What the fuck is Kohli shouting for,15
"Can Warner catch Rahul? 140 behind, potentially 3 matches to go.",3
Jesus Kohli is loud today.,16
NAOOOO RUN!,7
Kohli about to lose a lung,11
What's with all the screaming lol,19
Why is koach and Co screaming so much lmao,11
I hate Kohli doing chattar pattar like a gully cricketer. Grinds my gears.,10
Wow a spinner is gonna end up bowling in the last 5,2
is this the worst IPL King Koach had run scoring wise ?,4
Why are so many of them yelling at once,10
"Kohli to Siraj: Bhenchod, peeche khada hua hai chutiya",15
Kohli got off the meds today,10
[deleted],0
Finch and Kohli chirping together against Warner. Gotta love the IPL.,14
RCB have to most loudly aggressive team,9
Wtf was that from warner,3
"Yo, I'm usually the one defending players being vocal but what is this market-level hollering.",8
I don't know if it's really hard to score runs but they are putting too much pressure on themselves in trying to not lose wickets.,3
"Why is warner shouting so loudly? I have the match on mute but I'm still able to hear his ""no run"" call in India",13
"And yes 




Bhenchod",8
Can this DJ actually just go ahead and mute himself. Fkn insufferable,8
WHY ARE THEY SHOUTING SO MUCH,9
is it just me or does anyone else does not like kohli cursing his out fielder??,18
"If Saini were a different bowler, he wouldn't be Saini anymore.",3
"The problem with SRH is, if you take one wicket, middle order comes

If you take three wickets, you can see tail end.",11
"Bro they are all on, what Pant was on",16
"Kohli about to go in the ""tu jaanta hai mera baap kon haii"" mode",6
When you try to shout to make up for the insecurity of not scoring enough runs..lmao,1
gg,3
Is Siraj bowling death today?,3
Kohli trying to give some competition to Pant in the screaming department,8
"RRR more than 7

Tough for SRH without shah now",5
So Goswami is a specialist Wicketkeeper,5
"Why are people so annoyed about the noise in the field lmao

It keeps your team's spirits up and annoys the opposition at the same time",6
"Well shit, Warner back on his defensive track. We lost the game lads.",6
"Where were you when RCB got knocked out?



*I was home eating chappal, when phone ring*



*RCB is kil*


*yes*",2
RCB has only two fast bowlers today smh,3
"low-quality batting, high-quality shouting. just rcb things.",6
No Towels yet.. No Dew...,2
Kohli drank some of Pants tonic,5
"Fucking koach and his twats. Hahahha 
I love watching Hyderabad do well.",2
Saini bowling really well to Warner. No room at all.,1
Kohli is really getting on my nerves,0
Mandatory one wide per over by siraj,3
Rcb bois reminding me of gully cricket back in the day! Dont let the batsmen concentrate!,7
Both kohli and Warner are trying to assert their dominance by shouting like mad men,4
Jyotish told Siraj to bowl a first ball wide each over to get a wicket in the over,4
Siraj just wants to bowl additional bowls lol,2
They are gonna make the batsmen cry with all the shouting,3
"RCB:

I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown  
SRH resuscitates me, it fucking hates me 

And I love it, wait?",3
warner hates bairstow.,1
Why hasnt Pawan Negi played today. WOuld make it 5 spinners. And he is also a left armer. He hasnt played at all this season for RCB. Koach has probably lost faith in him.,2
Starts over with a wide.. Wicket incoming,4
Saini bowls really good lenghts.,4
"Siraj following the sequence of his 1st over.

Wicket coming up.",2
Siraj being Mcgrath.,2
Wicket after a wide for siraj,3
"First ball wide bois, he's gonna take another wicket",3
lol finch doing captaincy after being tired of koach’s diaper tactics,5
Won't be much due if there's dot balls and it never goes in the outfield lol,2
Would you bowl 3 siraj in PP and keep a spinner for death?,5
Siraj is bowling a lovely line (if he was bowling to a left hander),7
Siraj again starting with a wide to repeat the last over.,5
"Siraj 1 wide=1 wicket
2 wides=2 wickets??",3
Which is worse? Siraj's man bun or Natarajan's neckbeard,7
Siraj wide daal kr hi match jita dega don't worry guyz,2
Holder is better than Cottrell still doesn't play for wi t20,3
SRH gonna win with all the Siraj wides,9
3 out of 6 are wide runs,1
Kohli today reminds me of a legendary sledge that backfired - why are you chirping mate?,4
"Siraj either bowls pies or a peaches, no inbetween",7
siraj scored half of srh runs thru wides,5
Extras the top scorer for SRH,8
"Warner screams "" NOOOOO RUNNNN"".



Virat screams '' WOOOOO NO INTENT BOYSSSSSS""




Warner : "" 😦""",13
"Wtf!! Why all of RCB players are shouting? They couldn't make a good target so they are distracting batsmen?
It's total nuisance to watch though.",11
12 overs of spin incoming,3
RCB have started terrific here.,5
Extras are unacceptable while defending 127,6
Get Warner pls,7
STOP THE COUNTing of runs - An RCB supporter,22
"Even if warner gets out early , M Pandey can chase it down",3
David Warner should just go and ask VK the price of his fish.,4
"Mohammad Siraj starting the over with wides so that batsman wont be facing back to back maiden

Inflate deflate strategy",10
Pandey please rotate strike,2
are they gonna shout after every dot ball...,9
Siraj you're a Hyderabadi boy go easy on us lol,11
SRH Vs KXIP PTSD anyone?,6
"After the first wide, Koach guides Siraj for some time. 

Second delivery - Wide again.",5
Moeen Ali will bowled Warner - my prediction if wrong will quit reddit,4
So RCB have 4 Spin options today. Can be a game-changer if utilized properly,1
"Dude Manish, take singles.. dont build pressure on warner",5
"1st over 1 Wide : 1 wicket

2nd over 2 Wides : 2 Wickets.

Profit for Siraj.",7
"Warner- Kya tuthul puthul, Kya tuthul puthal laga rakha hai",7
"Moeen Ali, Zampa, Sundar and Chahal - RCB needs 2 of them to have a great game",2
Achi fielding madarchod -koach,11
Still don’t understand how people are okay with the concept of auction,7
What did Kohli say about Hyderabad?,9
I love how RCB can score a really low score and then still go out there with the fight and aggression as if they just scored 200.,4
"I would love to see a Hotstar stream without commentary, just hearing from stump mic",6
Kohli should bag a sponsorship from Amazon for how much he's recommending the Boys.,8
I was confident that Mohammad Siraj will do well until I saw him adopt a Umess-style man-bun.,4
I just realised RCB is logo is the banner of house lannister and SRH logo is banner of house Arryn,3
RCB field is as loud as a fish market lol,15
Am i the only one nervous?,4
Aaj nahi mar raha shot?,5
Someone please post whatever Kohli is saying. Can't hear it clearly.,7
"SRH fans should be happy, still better than last night's 0/3",9
Oh my god please don't be a 2 run per over match.,2
Manish pandey will he be like Sky cause he's sledges a lot,3
"2016 really was THE chance. Peak Kohli, finals run, chase in the kitty with Gayle striking well and Kohli driving it home...

Then Cutting bowls a cutter. It goes down the drain.

"Bhogle - RCB are playing for survival.

What are SRH playing for then in an eliminator?",15
Well that shut em up lmao,11
Not having saha was a tragedy how much srh are gonna suffer from the injury gods,8

Here we go.,2
Who's idea was it to have Pandey in our team again?,1
Ye le shot mar Diya koach lol,4
Lol pandey hits the six and all the chatty fielders go absolutely quiet,13
Pandey in knockouts is a dangerous bat btw,8
Virat and Warner making up for the lack of audience,18

Why can't I hear those shouts from the back again?,11
Hyderabadi Siraj bowling to Karnataka Pandey,9
"For Your Information, I predicted 32 balls 53 runs innings from pandey ji yesterday, lets see what happens",13
Bring Washington on,3
Probably Koach wished himself birthday wishes. Hence this,10
"Hits a 6 and then takes a single, somewhere someone will be happy...",12
"Manish ""I ain't hitting unless y'all planning to drop me"" Pandey",2
"Come on lads, cricket is far more enjoyable to play and watch when the fielding side is loud (unless you're batting ig)",5
Remember Pandey hitting a six last year when 7 runs were needed off the last ball to draw the match and go to the super over? I don't.,2
Kohli: come on run!!,1
"Six. Pandey breaking the shackles.

Only to succumb in next over.",0
SRH batters are shell shocked by Kohli's banter here.,6

I hate SRH fans at least Mumbai fans don't act concerned when their team is easily winning,-4
They gonna shout their way to the next match or something,5
Arghhh rcb and their noisy sledging. Goo srh,3
It's the typical match phase of RCB where they try to give the slightest of hopes and then crush them.,2
"I feel bad for ABD, he is stuck in RCB - he has five 50s this year, poor lad has so much pressure on his shoulder all the time. If he was in teams like MI - I bet MI would have 8 titles.",13
LORD,1
"Cmon Pandey, think you're playing for KKR",4
I think the only reason Zampa is in the team is so that Koach can practice against him in the nets before Australia tour,12
Gube,5
DC praying so hard for rcb to win,2
"When you see Siraj & Saini's names in batting card, you know it is fucked up",2

Why tf do we have the statue at mid on ffs,7
Ohhh That's why Dube sucks,8
Kohli is gonna be mad about it,6
With that headband Dube is looking like taller version of Ashok Dinda.,11
Dube ji. You must stop it.,2
RCB just screams like monkeys who can't have banana,0
"Can’t stand this Siraj. Something about him rubs me wrong. 

Him and Moeen on the RCB.",3

Dube always looks nervous,3
Kohli is chirping and egging. Good sign for SRH.,6

Dube is prime example of fitness does not equal agility.,7
"Btw the brute guy Samad we got is a specialist against spin, or as I've heard",8
Lots of spin to come. Warner is still there :O,2
"Kohli be like screw tactics boys, let's scream SPARTAAAAAAAAAA",18
Unpopular Opinion: Manish Pandey's run have came in a team which is not as strong as MI and have came mostly in tricky situation. Can't be said about Suryakumar.,8
"Guys, you’re not understanding their strategy, its called inflate deflate strategy",5
What will they talk about in the dugout debate?,4
Koi ni boyss c'mon boyss,2

Genuinely feel sad for us and RCB. Its been extremely unlucky for us we have not been playing badly just playing badly when it matters most,13
Virat may commit murder,5
"Thanks ABD, very cool.",2
Fucking hell AB that shit scared me,5
Wow,1

AbD being a 360 wicketkeeper.,12
WTF,5
Oh nooooo,2
That’s a no ball? Didn’t know that,7
RCB's focus seems all over the place. Which is really no focus at all. In comparison SRH have looked laser sharp,6
gote mooh mei aa gye the,5
For one second my heart stopped when I thought Warner was hit wicket.,13
Run out here?,0
Why free hit? Because of AB?,5
This shouldn't be a free hit no fault of bowler,6
*Run him out*,9
Run him out... Lol,10
Run him out lol,8
Haha you can tell Gavaskar doesn’t quite like SRH much,7
Cmon umpires have some humor,3
"After carrying the batting, de villiers tries to carry the bowling as well by trying to get Warner out",3

"""Run him out"" and the ball went to Moeen lol",7
Atleast he didnt get runout,2

Lol AB said Run him out lol,3
"Unfair to the bowler, this shit gets added to their tally",10

RCB can win if they stop counting the runs scored by SRH,10

"RCB: Royal Chokers Bangalore.

So unfortunate to see a team that you support, constantly disappointing you.",5
One of rcb or dc need to bring Warner into 2016 form. Its the only way I see MI not winning the cup. Short of MI having a terrible day out.,7
Wow! This is a fine shot,2
Reckon a run out was possible if no slip,2
RCB doing what RCB does best bulshitting through the season to choking in playoffs,7
ABD realized SRH is not so stupid...,11
Nice fielding effort by Moen. Was giving the ball directions as it passed by.,6
Atleast I can stop watching IPL and start studying for my exams now.,8

If De Villiers was Haddin he would have appealed  for Warner's wicket,5
"Every time RCB loses like this, you think Kohli’s ego takes a battering. But somehow it doesn’t",6
Yeah we have fair play award🙂🙂,4
The bowler did nothing wrong. It was ABD's mistake. Giving that a no ball is like punishing the bowler,8
"Kohli should be sacked, rebuild the team around lord siraj",7
Manish Pandey redemption arc is my favorite this season.,3
RR last in the tournament and Fair Play,3
Has Saini tried to kill anyone else after being hit for runs?,3
Nice fielding effort by Moen. Was giving the ball directions as it passed by.,8
Manish nuvvu chala manchi raaa,4

"Poor AB. That sinking feeling of failing in a semi/playoff.  
  
Its almost a South African's private piece of hell",3
"Man this is nothing more than passive-aggression by RCB, wont take u anywhere",3
Dance around in the pitch like Finch or stand and deliver like Pandey.,3
Guys will srh win? I am now in doubt,2
"I saw you trynna do the reverse sweep Warner, don’t pls",9
Please Warner you don't need those reverse switches to score.,3
Pandey knows how to keep his ipl contract. Plays few decent innings.,4
"What a shit show both the playoffs, did DC RCB really deserve the playoff spot.",5
"RCB getting ready to remove the coaches again. Captain is never the problem, it is always the coaches.",10

"Pandey 22(15) and Warner 8(11).

If these numbers were swapped, we SRH fans would have been panicking already.",10
Koach blaming his bowling when his batting  has been shitting for 4 games now.,6
"Don't buy ETFs kids, always buy direct mutual funds. ETF market in india is very illiquid.",8
Kohli is only seen standing next to his bowler right after a wicket has fallen.,3
Dhawan is a much better actor than most other cricketers.,19
Who tf is gonna bowl in the death? Koach??,13
ABD giving competition to Pant? xd,11
Siraj probably got bored of the top knot,7
Yupp TV ad haters anyone? 🙄,5
Fuck my life,10
MI is winning everything this season again?,6
RCB is going to play spinners in th death overs?????,4
RCB fucked up by not playing Parthiv Patel this season. They thought they could get some Gayle level performances from Finch/Phillipe. Instead they waited and waited and nothing came.,11
Siraj bowling short to Warner. Why?,1
"I am just disappointed with this young gen Cricketers, they are so delicate - look at Paddikal/Pant/Shaw etc. they all act like they are injured in fielding or if ball touches them.

Previous gen had no such sassy ppl.",-3
"Pandey always struck me as that guy who thought he was too good for domestic cricket, but could never really stamp any kind of authority at the international level. This looks like a great chance for him to turn up and win an important match.",9
at least he didnt start off with a wide,3
*Are ya winning Koach?*,8
"This sucks. DC and RCB were my favourite teams this season, both are in atrocious form.",5
"The fielding should support the bowling with such a score. Sadly, below par fielding till now",3
SRH UNSTOPPABLE,6
Absolutely toying with the lineup,6
Pandey: Look at me. I'm the Saha now,9
Too short Siraj,3
Spinners gonna bowl the next 10,2
I've made peace with the fact that we will never win anything as long as Koach is captain. Dude is just plain incompetent when it comes to captaincy and has no ability to inspire others like some of his contemporaries.,4
"Warner is like ""Bhenchod ab chillah""",3
Good guy Warner ending RCB fans suffering as soon as possible,1
Moeen is running behind the ball like that 40+ uncle. Just waiting for it to reach boundary,4
"I've understood one thing. If Pandey comes early enough, in the powerplay, he can play like an actual good player",3
"This is how you show aggression. Have some shame, Koach.",3
"Why can't Kohli bat like this, just why",7
Can’t one good thing happen in 2020? Why can’t Rcb win? Why do still keep supporting this team?,6
Find someone who trusts you as much as kohli trusts siraj,5
Is there dew or is the bowling just bad?,3
Fucking hell Warner chill out mate,4
Jokes on you ...match won't last 15 overs.. Kohli using bowlers wisely,3
Shout now bc,1

I wish koach could sledge himself into form,1
FUCK,0
[removed],2
Almost 1/3rd of the target has been already scored.,3
Why isn't Warner batting at a SR of 100? Isn't that what captains do?,4
FUCK,3
Why the hell would you do that Siraj?,5
"If SRH finish this game early, the RCB boys can go for another cruise party organised by Mr Nags.",8
FUCK,2
Haven't seen a single close match recently.,2
Rip,2
This game is done. Grats SRH. I should find another team to support next season instead of shitty RCB.,3
Warner is fucking with Siraj there. LoL,2
KKR/RR/KXIP in playoffs would have been so much more interesting. They are the only teams that could've toppled MI.,4
FUCK,1
Hope Siraj looks at how Sandeep bowled when the ball was no longer swinging. Siraj goes reverse stonks after two overs.,1
"If he bowls siraj now who tf will bowl at the death, what the actual fuck kohli.",1
This night One orange is winning and another(a certain man) is losing. 😂👍🏽,3

Why did he have to wait 14 seconds? Literally everyone knew he would review it,3
Another shit review?,2
HAHAHAHAH kohli and shit reviews,1
Good bowling this is,2
Uffff that was close one. But it's hitting on his stomach,3
What's the device that umpires keep looking at when they don't wanna give out?,1
Haha so desperate,-1
Ball tracking please!,1
Phew,2
"TBH, I expected a better eliminator match judging by how competitive the IPL has been.

Neutral here, just want an interesting match. Not a match where SRH chase it down in 13 overs.

Don't care who wins.",7
That's out,4
"Ah the good ol' ""rock and roll""",4

That was out stop whining now.,2
"Don't hype too much guys this is a lost cause, and RCB does this, give a slight bit of hope, before losing comfortably.",9
"**5.4** Mohammed Siraj to Warner, OUT, **appeal for catch behind as Warner is cramped.** Kohli reviews. Short of a length and into his body as he's skipping down leg side again. There is a sound as it goes through. AB lunges low to his right to cover the angle of Siraj being around the wicket. He didn't seem convinced. It's definitely got a part of Warner's body. But did it hit glove before that? **Early pictures on Ultra Edge suggest that it might have.** Disturbance as the ball goes past his glove. challenge for the umpire is to determine whether that's trouser or ball and he'll have to check purely on visuals for that. For gaps and light. The ball is right in between the glove's edge and where the abdomen guard would be. **'I can see the ball is touching the gloves here,'** he says. So that will be out. **43-2**

Holy shit. That was close. Don't think it was conclusive enough.,2
"Manish is still on form tho, SRH need not to worry",1
Warner just got out to his jockstrap brushing the ball,5
Iffy decision IMO,9
That was inconclusive. Benefit should have been given to Batsmen.,9
THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE TO OVERTURN. WTF,11
Umpires really just hate giving SRH any benefit of the doubt lmao.,19
That was out. How come everyone's so blind?,7
"What kind of fucking decision is that, dumb 3rd umpire",7
Jesus DRS absolutely hates Warner,14
"If it isn’t conclusive, you should go with on field decision imo 

It could have hit the trouser",10
"From front cam, it doesn't look out tbh. But yeah it's 50-50, either way it's fair.",7
Bruh what the fuck,9
"Siraj- well well, how the turntables",4
THAT WAS CLEARLY OUT,1
"Not the right call, fuck off. No conclusive evidence that that was hitting the glove.",19
Dick not big enough.,12
Definitely not a noise gloves make lol,7
Indian umpires . SMH .,2
Fucking hell that wasn't conclusive at all,12
Third umpire is a Koach cockholster lol,6
Mohammed 'takes all his wickets with the new ball' Siraj,7
Williamson better chase this one...,8
Warner bout to murder someone,4
If kohli or anyone in rcb even dares to sledge Williamson ......,7
"Had they got ultra edge on front on angle, it would be more conclusive",2
"Sounded more like box than glove but it's a tough decision

Think it's the right one but it could be argued",5
Saha absolutely changed the face of this team,4
Wtf! That wasn't conclusive enough to be overturned,11
"Unless Warner has a big dick, the edge was clearly the glove",8
See y’all next year,2
Lara and Swanny calling IPL sham for this decision what do you guys think?,9
SRH got this in the bag anyway. They have a good start,8
When did the trend of using hotspot die out? Surely BCCI can afford it?,5
r/agedlikemilk for everyone that said review out of frustration,7
"that's a big call, probably correct but can't say it was conclusive evidence",16
"That's fucking too close to call. 

WTF",7
Yasss Choke them,1
Hahahaha off you go David Warner straight outta Whoville looking ass,3
Cameraman following Warner waiting him to throw the bat lol,8
That’s a decision for Team Kohli only.,6
Still they just need 89 of 86 with Pandey in touch and Kane,8
They need conclusive evidence to overturn the decision. What a shit show of umpiring we get all the time.,8
"As an srh fan, I think that was probably out but shouldn’t have been overturned once it was given not out",9
"As a neutral, thats seems really inconclusive and definitely not enough to overturn onfield decision",9
Just like var lol,3
how do you overturn that lol,9
Williamson and Pandey please follow you captain now🙏🙏,8
I mean it should've been not out but hey I'm taking freebies in this situation,5
Don’t worry Kanos will win the match,8
How is that conclusive??!,9
Alia Bhatt looks pretty in pant ad,5
There was no gap between glove and ball. I would give that tbh.,5
"I'll take the wicket but seriously, why tf is there no hotspot? It would have made this decision so much simpler, whether it hit the pad or his belly or his glove.",11
Kohli is being such a prick,5
Ian Bishop is the most biased commentator I have ever seen.,8
🤡Umpiring in IPL🤡,2
That spike could be from ball hitting Warner's dick. Big Dick energy led to his downfall.,15
"I don't believe his trousers would have caused such a big spike to be honest, I'd give that out all day long",15
ngl umpire was scared of Koach,9
Happy seeing the benefit given to the bowler for once,2
"Yes it was inconclusive, but that wasn't a ""shit"" or a ""wrong"" decision",5
I hope SRH doesn't collapse now :(,3
they gave it out because they're afraid of Kohli's tamasha,8
Send the third umpire to call the US elections if he thinks this is conclusive.,5
lmao #thankyouvirat trending. Dogshit cricket fanbase,2
Little spike before it touched his dick,2
[deleted],5
Fucking hell that's terrible,6
"So, Warner is done. RCB fans to RCB now: ""Ye ho paayega tumse ki isme bhi chutiyapa karoge Kuch?""",1
Pre sandpapergate Warner would've been really pissed at that,5
"Bad decisions my arse. There was clearly no daylight between the glove and the ball lol, and the deflection was clearly downward. Stop crying.",-4
"It was clearly out, why are the commentators crying lmao",-3
Warner's **Thicc** gloves is his downfall,2
How long is this thrid umpire taking.,2
There's no conclusive evidence its out. Such fucking bullshit.,7
"Why didn't they put ultraedge from the front angle, it was super clear",3
"I thought the spike was from his trousers and dick/abdomen guard  
  
but the angle looked close. Feel for Warner there",8
I don't care what anyone says I like seeing the third umpire make a close decision against the field umpire,4
Warner would have been saved if he had an erection,5
That was not out the spike came from edging his cock,8
"Lol last game vs SRH, a clear waist high no ball against Williamson wasn't given and now this. Good for us I guess.",6
"That was clearly out, wouldn’t be such a big spike if it was the ball hitting the trousers, Swanny come on bud.",-4
Hoping for Gavaskar/srikanth rant over this preposterous Umpiring,6
lmao even the damn commentator saying it's not really out.,11
"Paschim Pathak is the only good umpire this season

Change my mind",4
I want whatever the 3rd ump is smoking,3
Wrong decision,3
"Hit the glove first guys, the small spikes. 
Then it hit the trousers, the huge spike. 
Good decision I feel.",7
[removed],7
Umpire Ravi is awesome. See Warner's reaction and you know it was not out. Brilliant decision nullified by 3rd umpire forgetting the concept of benefit of doubt and Umpire's Call.,14
Benefit of doubt is supposed to go the batsman...,3
Should've looked at ultra edge with front view also,4
I hope Warner calls out the umpire post match regardless of the result. Disgraceful.,11
Warner got a boner,11
Can't call the umpire incompetent here. That was a very tough and close call. It did seem like the ball hit the glove,2
Best situation to have someone like Kanos,5
King Kohli King Kohli,-2
Bullshit. It's got to be conclusive evidence and there's nothing conclusive about that.,12
"Tough decision, but I've seen way worst. I'm 65/35 thinking it's an out",1
"I don’t give a fuck

We’re going to lose anyway, will take these small victories.",7
"Its too close to call when the initial decision was not out.

Clearly not enough evidence to overturn. Shit decision!",16
brainless call by the umpire,7
I don't know. That looked out to me,-1
"Definitely not conclusive enough, should have stuck with the soft signal.",6
Kane mama take us home. Oops not that home...next match.,9
"Why do Indian cricketers tell ""YEESS BOIII""?",3
Warner is the first man to get out after giving an edge off da kock,8
"If this is a controversial decision, Warner should be still out there because the on-field decision was not-out.",3
That was his dick grazing against the ball ffs,5
Dude Kohli needs to calm his tits down,4
One of those decisions where either decision could be right or wrong. One side wouldve been unhappy. Just one of those moments. Hoping for a kanos rescue act 🥳,1
Inside part of umpires contracts is manufactured by Wrogn,5
"RCBs chances to win go from 5% to 8%.

This is what Trump fans must feel like rn.",9
Get kane and make this interesting!,2
"Get Kanos and baby you've got a stew going.

Please let's have a stew going whoever wins. Too many one sided affairs.",2
imagine srh collapsing to meme rcb bowling,9
[deleted],3
No amount of reverse jinxing (including this) will help RCB today.,5
"Really tough decision, there needs to be some technology on top of ultra-edge to discriminate between hitting glove, body, or bat. All ultra-edge shows that there was a noise.",4
This is tense!,1
THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE TO OVERTURN. WTF,15
Thats gonna be a controversial decision,7
"Don't they need to have ""conclusive evidence"" to overturn onfield decision? Surely there was doubt. Nevertheless makes match interesting",7
Trousers first.Poor umpiring.,6
How to the fuck do you overturn that? That's bullshit,10
Bet Warner wishes he didnt have such MAGNUM DONG rn,8
Srh has depth in their batting should be able to chase 130,3
"RCB fans spamming ""that was out"", such desperation",-2
That was an absolute shit decision.,7
What's the importance of soft signals?,1
THANK YOU THIRD UMPIRE THANK YOU. SRH PLEASE SCREW UP FROM HERE PLEASE,6
[deleted],2
"To the guys saying there's a gap between glove & ball, where? I can't see any gap.",4
Everyone sees what they want to see. Realty is a construct of our minds.,4
"Dear Third Umpire, that's not how you take a decision & overturn to OUT. If there's no conclusive evidence that it's OUT , you shouldn't overturn the NOTOUT to OUT.   


Go learn the basics, you motherfcker!! Suck on Kohli & RCB. Chuut",3
"Commenrator listing bat, tummy, glove, etc etc being close to bat. So? 

Ball clearly kissed the glove. 

Glad he did not list dick being close too.",12
Warner was nottttt out wtfff,3
Definitely deserved that 4,1
As a neutral it's very hard for me to say that was not out.,9
"Williamson be a nice guy and get out pls

Thanks",6
Definitely got a whisper in the ear to quickly change his mind to being out from the exact same evidence he was already looking at,6
Get Williamson early and advantage RCB,2
RCB IS BACK IN THE GAME YAAAS,3
"So, a leg slip for Lord Siraj....",3
Relax SRH. You have the world's best test batsman to get you through,7

Kanos is Ab level hard to get out,3
IT'S NOT CONCLUSIVE.,11
Swanny hates rcb for some reason.,3
Stop being salty about out,9
It's not like rcb is going to win this.,4
"Is it hit the bat or glove, koach?",3
Siraj giving batsmen the erection they need to get away with ultra edge.,7
From what I could see it seemed out. Why are tv commentators feeling it might not be?,0
[removed],-4
"That spike was not (definitively) from glove. Glove and bat spikes are not so wide.  It could've (also) been glove, but there is no way to tell. There is not enough evidence to overturn the decision.",0
Lmao the same people criticizing the game to be so batsmen friendly are complaining now. Remain firm in your opinion fellas.,4
Looking at this seems that Siraj is gonna be a great red ball bowler.,5
Warner robbed lmao,10
Surely that wasn't conclusive evidence? Umpire has fucked it there,12
Fuck it now i want srh to win,9
Shouldn't the decision be inconclusive? Nothing is clear over there.,5
I guess this is the bit of luck RCB needed to turn the match in their favour. Ugh.... Getting lucky when you need it is hard to beat,3
"_AB and Kane on the field at the same it._

Kohli: _Is this love that I'm feeling?_",6
"Chutya Siraj instead of adding pressure after that wicket, reversed it and eased it off. Peak RCB.",11
"What is actually the song of Srh

GO GO GO TRADE THEM AND FUCK THEM ORANGE ARMY?????",2
if SRH now lose that decision is going to be incredibly controversial,6
Kane is the guy you want for a run a ball chase,7
Got to give to the umpires: they are the worst performers consistently despite RCB and DC efforts.,7
"The camera quality during this ipl is ridiculous, especially the zoom in one's",10
"Right decision. The non-ultra edge shot from behind Warner showed a gap between the body and the ball, no gap between the gloves, and then a deflection between frames towards the body. Ultra-edge lost a lot of detail on the footage, however, but showed the spike on the readout between the frames where the crisper non-ultra edge shot showed the deflection

Another notch on my ""get specialist third umpires"" argument tally, though",20
Very very tricky chase for SRH,4
So are they gonna fine Koach now?,3
"Nah, ain't having it. That angle was not conclusive enough to overturn. IPL and shit umpiring, name a better duo.",13
"Oh man I hope we win so that SRH can shout COME ONE COME ON COME ON in Chahal, Siraj, Kohli's face",13
"Lmao at RCB fans pretending that's a clear glove, if this was happening to Kohli heads would fall",24
Lord Siraj takes wicket and gives runs,6
"
we win or lose

atleast rcb cant cry umpire decision going against us if we win... 

original decision was not out and are you telling me that there was conclusive evidence to overturn the original decision?

fuck off",9
"Koach getting all the help he can, before he once again leads RCB out of another IPL tournament",6
very very tricky chase,1
Let's just do a simple voiceover like fuck RCB.,12
Lara and Swanny want to say IPL umpires suck but they don't want to be jobless 😞,16
"as much as wanted this to be out, it did seem inconclusive, whatever happened to benefit of doubt goes to the batsman? :/",1
Siraj gifting 4 runs for the poor decision,4
Question : was it conclusive enough to have the decision changed?,7
I am pretty sure this decision will not be controversial at all.,9
we need 8 wickets,3
Siraj gotta take one more for all these runs,3
84 off 84. This is SRH's game to lose.,11
Srh still sitting pretty here. All on Chahal now,2
Everyone in dugout is convinced it's not bat first but the third umpire isn't,9
Fuck it. At least Kohli/ rcb fans can’t whine that they lost (if they do) the match because Warner was given not out,7
The ump overturned the catch against CSK in like 10 seconds lol,4
flicked the glove. look at siraj's welcome delivery to kano. At least bowl at the stump/off channel man.,5
The spike started even before ball reached the gloves that means it's not out RCB fans . Peace out,1
"Kohli: takes review and the batsman is out

r/cricket: such an arrogant prick, sending an in-form batsman back to the pavilion",19

"Williamson, please play well today. A good inning due from you.",7

RCB need a total Spin domination if they are to win this match.,11
1 rpb needed,5
wtf why no saha?,1
What kind of shit umpiring was that?,1
Wasn't conclusive. Should have stayed with the on field call.,0
Srh has choked on a chase 10 runs fewer than this,6
Shitty umpiring,0
"ohhh I don't want to think about the amount of
 Kohli hate this is going to generate",3
"Hahaha Gavaskar was so quiet about that decision... but now so excited about next ball... looking for wickets. 

What’s with him and SRH lol",6
It looked like unclear. There was no need to change on field call.,6
Wow that wasn't conclusive at all. Bad bit of umpiring. We've seen this happen so much this IPL. Need better umpires next season,7
"Don't think there was enough evidence to overturn the decision. But he made the call , so we'll have to live it.",6
Get Yuzi on. Let Dube/Moeen bowl 19th 20th over. The match will not last that long if they dont get wickets. Yuzi needs to come on next over.,2
"Why are Kohli and co so agressive after even a dot ball.  

Taking intent to another level",-3
"Why do umpires never do anything in our favour first this

Now everyone is an umpire here.,9
"50-50 call for Warner.

Umpires seem to have forgotten the benefit of doubt rule completely these days.",-1
What's the use of taking a wicket if you give 13+ in an over.,4
The entirety of the fab 4 seem to be out of form atm.,6
Siraj bowling to pads when there is a slip is non understandable.,4
Now choke them with spin,4
You aren't gonna get that kinda spike for brushing the pants. It was glove.,2
Will people flame Kanos if SRH go on to lose and he fails?,2

u/casualwebster enough please. Rcb aint winning today,10
Man you really have to resign watching cricket and declare yourself a fucking blind if you think that wasn't out. IT WAS CONCLUSIVE. Now go back to sucking donkey balls.,-6
Thing is if it was given not out rcb would have abused and since out srh is. Lose-lose situation,4
"Two more wickets and the tailend begins. Yuzi, your game now.",2

RCB is the impostor.,1
Just a run a ball. Williamson loves chases like these. So SRH please don’t fuck it up and do what you did vs KXIP,4
Kanooooooooooo,1
Doubt: Is it still out if the ball touches your body and then your glove and someone catches it?,1
"Now SRH knows how it feels when Kings XI raised the issue about the erroneous 1-run short call, which was pretty much more definitive than this call.",5
Williamson's wicket early and I think RCB can win this if no dew,2
Kohli doing everything Thala used to do except fucking winning,7
Surely ball would have touched some part of glove atleast it was so close .Good decision .,0
Poor Warner got a boner at an unfortunate time.,14
That decision is a great example of why we need specialised TV umpires and not just rotating on-field umpires to use the technology. Train up some umpires specifically to use the tech properly day in and day out.,6
I think that decision was made keeping in mind that Kohli is the opposing captain in a desperate situation. He might have punched an umpire or so had that been given not out /s,5
Oh yes the absolute war,2
Woeful umpiring,2
Unbelievable decision. There was nothing conclusive with those angles to show that the ball touched the gloves. And considering it over turned the decision is unbelievable.,7
"Ambani paid the umpire guis, they want RCB OR DC in final against Mi.

Looks like Zampa in team to pick Kane's wicket,4
Mullet boi is in,2
"Come on Zampa, spin Kane out.",2
If one thing is really obvious is that we need to implement hotspot in most major tournament . The tech is expensive but the investments need to be done. It's different if we don't have the tech but having it and not using it is not acceptable.,7
Tbf that was a bit too close... Should have gone with the soft signal... But I don't complain,7
"Dude 3rd umpire legit said ""ball near gloves and spike on the screen, it's out"" like wtf",3
"Also, Srh fans acting like the game isn't already in their bag with Garg, Samad and holder still to come and Williamson and Pandey at crease.",6
"First it was SRH vs RCB no ball case and wides

Now, Warner being out in an inconclusive decision. While cricket has improved as a game. The umpiring has evolved backwards.",2
Kanos has better strike rate than Koach in IPL,5
"No one:

David Warner: *Mike Oxlong*

Siraj: Lemme fix that 

Umpire: *Task failed successfully*

Why is Williamson in the field this early? Whom do we have if he is out,5
zampa right on the money!,2
"I'm sorry we can all argue about whether it hit the gloves or not but the rules are simple.

You do not overturn the onfield umpires call unless it is absolutely clear. No way that was conclusive. We've been on the receiving end of this rule so this stings.",4

Both of them are excellent players of spin,2
"SRH fans after Warner got out: ""Thakur toh giyo bhaia, Thakur toh giyo""",7

Come on Kane don't build up unnecessary pressure.,8
"Everyone saying that was obviously not out, tell me how can an umpire look at images of the ball being in touch with the glove, and the ultra edge showing massive spikes, and give that not out? What more ""enough evidence to overturn the onfield decision"" is required?",8
"Moeen walks in

RCB fans: Moeen gonna score 50

ABD with 4 overs left.

RCB fans: Hope ABD scores 60 off last 4.

I think that was out but a trained 3rd umpire shouldn't give that out. No conclusive evidence,2
"that zampa, sundar and yuzi are going to squeeze the life out of our middle order :(",1
"Chahal, please think about your dm during bowling",7
Brain-dead Pandey pls don't try taking on Chahal. Play normal,5
Kanos auditioning for CSK berth next year?,9
"SRH are going to bottle this again, aren't they?",4
"Come on Williamson, send this 90s kid back to the his mama crying.",11
Zamps putting the clamps,2
"Warner has not destroyed RCB this year

Moral victory",18
Who okayed these stupid ass cringy Colgate ads.,6
I’m calling wicket alert here,1
That was clearly not out. The ball passed the glove and in the next micro second it touched the pocket which made the spike. How are these guys 3rd umpires? I will do it for half the money these guys are doing it.,2
[deleted],2
Crazy to think that Siraj was part of the SRH indian medium pacer bowling battery once,5
Colgate has all the budget in goddamn world and they come up with ahh karo gerns koh nah karo ads ffs,4
If Kohli got out liek that in an important game he'd kill the umpire,7
Chahal bowl full please.,3
SRh are being braindead here. Making Zampa look better than  Rashid Khan.,7
Just 1 wicket more for the tail to come in.,10
"To be fair, commentators don't really know that the ball *didn't* touch the glove at the same time when it brushed the trousers - this is a weakness of ultra edge, but can't blame them for following an objective standard like ""spike when ball passes the bat/glove"".",2
Bruh for all those crying look at Gaikwads catch against KXIP or the short run of KXIP vs Delhi 😂😂,3
"also good riddance the drama that was avoided

i would rather take warner shaking his head and walking as opposed to kohli doing everything possible to show he is petulant child",6
Singles are enough boys,4
"SRH is my perennial second team. Ah, love what legends like Laxman, Baylis and Muralitharan have done to SRH. The value-for-money each player brings is invaluable to the team.",9
"Chahal and Washy have bolwed too short today.

Toss it up ffs, it's your last game of the tourney",7
"If there's no dew, the RCB spinners will be a handful",3
If RCB wins today the best part would be seeing Zampa and Stoinis together next match,7
Getting KXIP-SRH Vibes,8
Why is pandey chilling this time,3
Zampa is the true sucessor to Shane Warne in limited overs.,6
Conclusive evidence seen on VGA cameras? Please,11
AB really wants to win this fucking IPL,19
now watch kohli save chahal for the end when the game is done and dusted,4
Ipl should just make an award named for another sponsor The Controversial Triggering Moment of the day,16
Definitely rashid,9
Kane has to deliver. He was our best batsman in the first half of the season but hasn’t done anything of note. Perfect run a ball situation to get back into form.,11
Swanny still having a go at the 3rd umpire,6
"These "" Who is more important to their side? "" Questions are dumb af.",25
Need to do this in match what we couldn't do against KXIP : rotate the strike against spin bowlers and not add unnecessary pressure,4
That was not conclusive enough to overturn at all. This happened to us as well where the ump didn't even take his time to judge,6
why does sunnyG insist on calling him YAUJERVENDRA chahal?,9
Pressure building up on SRH.,2
Kanos fanboys remind me of Dravid fans who claim he's better than Sachin,4
What kind of stupid ass comparison is this? Like who tf even comes up with these comparisons.,9
[removed],9
">Gopal: Siraj is gaining the confidence of Kohli as the tournament progresses. It would be interesting to see if he gets a game Down Under.

Don't see him starting ahead of Saini in Tests",1
"I must admit, Chahal is a better leg spinner than my aunt.",7
Required rate over 6.5. I'm feeling the choke,2
What happened to IPL theme songs? I still remember grooving to 'ye hai india ka tyohaar' and 'come on bulaava aaya hai'. Good ol' days.,8
"Key for SRH to win - Not losing wickets in next 6 overs

Key for RCB to win - Pray! 🙏",7
All I need is front angle evidence with ultra edge. Only then we can know the spike,3
"Chahal should be a measurement of weight

as in... how many Chahals does Polard weigh?",4
"Oh no I know this script, its SRH vs KXIP 2: Electric Boogaloo",7
This is the last batting pair who could negate spinL,3
sunny G is overhyping RCBs chances,7
I know he's the opponent but you can't seriously not like Kanos,8
I really have no hope in Williamson in this match,3
Warner's smile is very menacing,4
Zampa took down a nearly full strength english squad earlier this year. Thats impressive,6
I swear Warner looks like a psychopath when he’s sitting and always smiling there,7
"Why are all these survey questions so dumb?

Might as well ask questions like 'who's thicker, pant or Rohit?' at this rate.",11
SRH needs to blast these spinners out of the attack and finish match early otherwise they will collapse.,5
Zampa's already bowled wayyy better than Udana,6
Shit commentary again. Who is that? Sunny?,4
ZAMPSTAGRAMMM,2
Swanny is murdering Nasser,4
Let's goooo,1
Get fucked srh.,-1
Oof that's a big wicket,2
Kanos looking like hot Jesus is not gonna cut it today... We need match winning innings,6
BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,4
Zampa baby my love,7
WTF,3
pls SRH give kanos to us nest  year .,4
"Pandey out, fuck this innings we have lost.",4
That acko ad reminded me of takeshi's castle,4
PLEASE GET PANDEY OUT HE IS MAKING UNCOMFORTABLE,6
"Rcb, play bold and give an over or two to Koach. He is a big match player and he always performs, but he shit the bed with the bat, which can only mean one thing...",6
That's lazy from Manish Pandey.,3
NOOOOOOO,3
Fuck u Pandey,2
Fuck yeah,3
What a catch ABD,4
They're collapsing guys,4
"Rather than Yuzi, Zampa does it. Whichever way it comes.",3
Interesting,2
YESSSS,6
Don't give me hope,9
Wtf I love zampa now,8
Thanks Zampa,6
Zampa really wants to see Stoinis,6
Keep whining that this hasn't been edged.,5
Fuck's sake SRH,3
ZAMPAAA bowling beauties so that he gets to bowl to stoin in the next match,7
Send in Holder and let him belt sixes.,4
Its all happening!!,3
And it begins...,3
OOOOOOALALLALAALALALLAA,2
"Goddamn, i cant think of any reason to hate you SRH guys? Go win against DC and MI, get the CUP!",2
MoM ABD,1
SRH fans on suicide watch rn,3
Zampa badly wants to meet stoin !!,8
Fuck yeahhhhbhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!,1
Zamp you beautiful mf,4
Big wicket. Buy that man a haircut.,7
What is Chahal chewing?,2
i love watching a battle between two fanbases who have so much ptsd from their teams that neither think they’ll win,12
rip,2
Pandey prediction aged like milk,4
Yessssss,1
Congrats RCB,2
I feel it today kane is gonna win us the match,2
Hell yeah boys! Go Zampa!,2
"Whatever fuck up the opposition can do, we can do better. 
 
sigh.",7
Don’t do that. Don’t give me hope.,2
Guys if rcb wins now its like a we already won trophy. but if we lose its just another normal day.,3
Adios muchchos.,3
"Manish pandey love you
From mr nags",5
Please please please kill srh,3
"If their scores were flipped and it was Williamson getting out, people would be blaming Pandey for the wicket",8
"We lost this shit. Also, fuck the umpires.",3
LETS GO BOYS,3
AB's 3 out of 3 catches,6
Yes Zampa. Great ball,2
Yaaaahhah. ESCN,4
The power of the mullet,6
How's this happening,5
I'm panicking.,4
pandey ji whyyyy its just run a ball!,5
Zampa I love you,2
SPIN MASTERCLASS BABYYYYYYYY,4
Pandey used to be a match winner for KKR. what happened to him.,3
Why is zampa picked they could've added Shabaz he did very well last match it would also free up a international spot they could've played Philippe and beefed up the batting,0
Wtf is happening,3
"Xampa got a wicket?

Wow these changes working for RCB",3
"Don't do this, don't give me hope",3
Game on!,5
RCB RCB!!!!,1
Ggwp Bois. We'll come back next year!,0
"Halfway there. Get Williamson, Garg, Holder and we are done",3
Could rcb really,2
Choke,1
Zampa isn't producing any spin why isn't he getting hit?,2
Tail begins.,3
Send Garg in or Nadeem as a lefty,1
ABD won't be denied a title this time.,2
I don't know why I am scaring of Rashid now :( he will come to bat and smack us in all parts of ground and win the match for SRH (-_-;),1
ZAMPA VS STOINIS IN THE Q2,2
"We just need Kanos, Holder, Garg and Rashid boiss. Come on.",1
Rcb mightd actually have a chance...im ready to be heartbroken again,1
Pack it boys ... It was good journey,2
holder will finish this with 10 sixes #longlevers,2
"SRH, whatchu doing?",0
Zampa’s gotta be a virgin,2
Wtf!,1
"Gg RCB on the cup, we played well boys.",2
"1/6 

We are getting closer.

5 more to go.",2
GET WILLIAMSON OUT AND WE WIN,5
"Stop worrying SRH fans, this is the usual RCB gives a bit of hope so that their fans can breathe then punches them in their throat.",8
"Veganboi delivers.

Looks like an inspired pick right now.",2
ABD won't be denied a title this time.,3
Lmao srh is still winning this as long as holder is yet to come.,1
Why does Manish Pandey look like a discount Kunal khemu,3
Zampa really wants to meet stoinis.,3
Rcb wins only when opposition screws opposition,2
Love the hairstyle Zamps. Let’s remind them of 6/19,3
Garg and Kanos together will take the Required Rate to 10.00 fuck this,0
Still an easy win for srh from here,2
"I’ve legit walked out to go to the kitchen twice, and both times I’ve missed the wickets. Dafuq",3
What's with the zampa mullet?,2
GONEEE,2
Cya lads next year,2
Jason holder will muscle them over. Otherwise game is in RCB's hands.,1
Garg who can only score behind the wickets!,0
IPL writers want Zampa vs Stoinis in Q2.,2
I have never seen this Pandey ever win a match for his team. He's been playing for years now. It's a shame that he's a part of Aus tour but Suryakumar isn't.,2
ABD is a freakish talent,2
20 more runs would have made one helluva difference for RCB.,1
C’mon guys we can do it,2
I left work early to watch this?,3
It's all up to Kane now. He has to be there until the very end if SRH have to win this.,3
Don't give me hopes.....,2
Kohli's celebration has finally started getting on my nerves.,1
Why am I not surprised?,2
Lol we paid 11 crore for this.,2
"**8.3** Zampa to Pandey, OUT, **no doubt about this one!** Short of a length and sliding on outside off. Pandey is still moving into the leg side as he reaches out to stab for a single through cover. That's a clear edge, and catch number three for AB de Villiers **55-3**

MK Pandey c &dagger;de Villiers b Zampa 24 (21b 3x4 1x6) SR: 114.28",1
"So now I really wanna see a MI vs RCB Final. 
Given all the SKY and Rohit-Kohli drama, that would be din to watch.",3
Somehow i feel more anxiety in this match (MI fan),1
Who is this mr nags,1
Getting choked by the chokers,1
Imagine Warner and Williamson batting now. But no the third umpire botched it,3
7 more wickets to GO BOYS,3
[deleted],2
Picked up a funny thing Brits are taking side of Warner in that call maybe they hate Kohli more or maybe it was just clear bad decision.,4
That decision is gonna hurt them if SRH manages to lose from here,4
"Gg guys ,it's over.",2
why the fuck did we choose to chase? we cant do this,0
Get Kane,0
That catch though.,1
"**Batsmen hits a 4**

RCB Fans: Adios

**A Wicket Falls**

SRH Fans: Adios",9
"Why tf is the srh dugout always smiling, optimist is scary",2
Turns out using an extra spinner is working out for RCB!!,2
This match is getting very interesting,1
now Lord Siraj will release the pressure,2
Pandey disappoints yet again...,2
I missed the beginning did goswami open?,2
"r/cricket: These comparison polls are stupid

Also r/cricket: AB is so much better than Thala",2
Fuck... Virgin Zampa gets Chad Pandey out,1
This match suddent got a lot more interesting lol,3
"Srh making a meal chasing a low score

So, basically every srh game",4
Yesterday stoinis and today zampa. The couple is onto something,6
Holder's gonna make this chase real easy like he did the last time.,6
Zampa looking sexy as FUCK,3
Can we have a repeat of [this](https://youtu.be/bCzYe65W__0) beauty from Zampa to Williamson please!,2
Stoin- itna tadap raha hai mere se milne ke liye kya,3
Bruh If SRH loses Dc will be in the final only to get banged by MI again. Noooo,3
"Kane and Jason, thats it bois cmon",1
Fuck the umpires,1
Garg is the only proper batsman left rest all allrounders.,1
Why does SRH batting lineup seems so shit today?,2
Wish VVS could pad up and come in .,2
ADAM ZAMPA WHAT A BABE,3
"Will  RCB use their right arm ""quick"" bowler.",2
Rcb lads slowly turning on their TVs,2
inb4 holder hitting 3 sixes to end the game,5
Gotta love how Sunny G calls Yuzvendra Chahal Yajuvendra Chahal. He reminds me of cute boomers.,6
Kane? What is it? Is zampas hair intimidating you?,3
"Adam,  bande me hai dum,  shit commentry again",4
[deleted],9
Garg to prove his mettle,1
Damn Zampa looking threatening as fuck,6
Battle of the shittiest middle orders in the competition.,8
Zampa should donate his mullet hair to Donald Trump. Would benefit them both.,7
LETS GO ZANOS,2
This is the thing against Punjab played too passive and built up pressure,3
Zampa doing it to meet his love Stoinis in the next,6
"Zampa be like, ""Rashid, who?""",3
Zampa was with Stoinis last night if y'all want to know.Stoinis gave some luck to Zampa it seems.,7
Zampa doing well so that he can meet his friend Stoinis in the next match.,9
"Why are so many ""neutrals"" against RCB? Not really neutral are you",5
There should be a channel where we don't have these shitty commentators. Rather wanna hear on field commentary.,1
Zampgasum,1
Swanny fucking roasted Zampa damn.,5
Rashid who? Zampa is the real deal fellas,2
Swanny mocking Veganboi's good looks,1
Another good one from Zampa,2
This match is 80% won. Get kane and it's all over,3
"Zampa fucking over SRH... What's this, 2017?",5
What if you lost your wicket to somebody who looks like lesbian Steve Irwin?,2
Zampa you beauty,2
Lmao when was the last time Holder did something unbelievable with the bat in white ball?,1
"So, now only Jason to contend with.",1
Zampa is such a likeable guy.,5
Don't you think abd is standing too close to the wickets?,1
Zampa is the girlfriend i'll never have,6
SRH Entering the *uh oh* stage,4
Srh Vs kxip PTSD,1
"Its happening bois

Just need to get Kanos now",6
Fuck off Garg take singles.,1
I'm now officially having KXIP flashbacks.,6
SRH Vs KXIP PTSD anyone?,5
Zampa > Rashid confirmed,-2
Lmao people Complaining about Zampa earlier,1
Come on we need a last ball finish,1
"Warner wasn't caught behind 
He was Cock behind",6
Okay. Now I'm nervous. Could go either way. Save us Kanos.,1
PARTAYYYYYYYY,3
"Zampa and Chahal’s 8 overs would be the key factor in deciding......

whether srh takes this home in less than 15 overs or the game will stretch out till 18th over",4
We're gonna lose this aren't we,3
"This is what we were worried about, for all the annoyed RCB fans in the 1st innings",6
I feel Zampa exchanged his soul with Shane Warne right before the match,6
It was obvious that Zampa would have a good day today since Stoinis played well yesterday.,5
I swear if Koach gives pace the ball to release the pressure for SRH,0
"Rcb didn't screw srh, srh screwed srh",8
This game Priyam Garg can actually  show his potential. Interesting match now,3
Not much dew today SRH feels bad man,1
Someone from SRH need to counter-attack. Just soaking up dot balls isn't going to help them. Williamson has to accumulate but Garg has to attack.,2
"Am I the only one who finds the nickname Kanos cringe as fuck... 

So not fitting whatsoever",3
"that smile on warner's face reminded me that we have done pretty well getting till here 

even if we lose i am still happy

good season srh thank you

now lets enjoy the game",2
Choke risers Hyderabad,0
The only reason I want rcb to win is to see stoinis vs zampa. That will be some show,4
I think stoinis would be the bottom for sure with zamps,0
Looks like RCB will be 15-20 runs short afterall.,1
Everyone petting Zampa and his face be like 😒,2
Just need Williamson's and holder's wicket. Cmon boys,5
CMON BOYS GET WILLIAMSON AND WE ARE BACK IN THE GAME,3
cmon chahal,3
I have a harder time believing zampa is 28 than rashid being 22,5
[deleted],1
Kohli overcompensating for his failures with his aggression. ugly,2
What's with Zampa and Stoinis?,4
Just get kane jesus and we'll be back in the match babyy,3
"our tail is open, its RCB's game to loose now... still livid about warners call",2
This match looks repeat of kxip match. But they have kane this time,6
Can't afford to lose 2 more wickets. Then it's over.,1
There is Holder guys chill!!,3
"I \*HATE\* HOPE, especially from RCB.",15
In b4 Lord Shri Raj takes a fifer.,7
Srh fans slowly realising that they jinxed their own team,8
Kohli should use Moeen now,1
You know they are fucking this up when they aren't even taking singles which is pretty much on offer every ball,2
I'm worried saini siraj will get tonked,3
Kanos is the key now,2
Boys please just keep rotating the strike,4
The fact that 2016 was so long ago is mind boggling.,4
Two brilliant catches behind the stumps. Butler would've bottled those.,1
Listen guys... I don't really watch RCB bowl. But I keep switching it on every 15-20 minutes just to check the score and every time I've done that this season a wicket has fallen.,7
Why wasn't Zampa playing till now?,3
"It’s fine, if we loose we atleast have the David Warner wicket debacle to make ourselves feel better for playing like trash",5
It'll be heartbreaking if DC rcb meet again and one of us has to leave 😢,5
if RRR go over 8 SRH can't chase this,3
USE MOEEN,3
Oh boy this means SRH vs MI may be in jeopardy.,2
Garg will be out soon. Not reading at all,3
Kohli gonna bowl medium pace 18th over fml,1
Get Williamson you win the match,4
Anxiety.,0
My mom just called wicket alert lmao looks like she loves dugout too,3
Fucking rcb giving hopium,8
They should've sent samad and asked him to smack the spinners. That would've put pressure on them. This is nothing but a fucking repeat of kxip. Thank god I decided to stay out and not watch this shit show,4
"The third umpire was clearly not convinced in multiple replays, still he just went ahead called OUT, as if it has to given somehow! This is just ridiculous & outrageous umpiring.",4
Picked that wrong 'un perfectly Garg!,2
Still samad holder Rashid to come . They’ll easily win this,-2
Guys whats going on with the fab4 rn. Root might actually be the most inform out of all of them atm.,5
"Kohli: ""to whomever it may concern, fuck you""",11
Kohli might be a bad captain in terms of using his bowlers or with his selection but man knows how to set up a good field,6
Cmon guys take singles,2
Inb4 Koach doesnt give Ali a single over,3
AB just tapped his helmet after Virat tapped his hemlet during the wicket celebration. What a bunch of weirdos ❤❤❤,9
Wish saha was playing,6
The game is over. They are bottling this. RCB's matchh to lose now,8
"Well i do love these close, down-to-the-wire matches, but only when im a nuetral.",5
Hope Yuzi gets Kanos tonight.,8
lol who was saying Indian batsmen are good with spin,2
"SRH have to rotate the strike

Can’t afford to give dots continuously",2
Sunny G hates SRH lol,2
Garg appears to be such a liability,1
Dig into this untested middle-order bois. Time to replicate what Kings XI did to SRH.,1
Are we going to lose?,1
"Cmon Priyam, show us why we bought you!",2
Why is everyone taking 5 balls to get a fucking single?,8
"Swanny can be really annoying at times.

Like, pipe the fuck down when the game is tense.",6
SRH fans pretending they didn't see the spike while ball was near the gloves when there was clearly a gap between ball and stomach.,7
This situation is set up for Kanos like it was for Rahane the other day,3
"Even if rcb wins this they will lose in next match, mark my words please, nothing personal but they are just not meant to win, their team is only created for memes and they should stick to team's purpose",-3
Both SRH & RCB batting looks like the  2 Spiderman meme pointing  at each other.,13
"STOP THE BOWLING 

SRH won based on current runrate",20
Siraj's runs in the backend might be the difference,6
"Man, that KXIP match scarred us for life, didn't it?",16
I feel we are still around 20 runs short,16
Garg is choking us,6
RCB now has a 28% chance of winning. Massive turnaround.,10
Srh are still favourites till daddy kanos is still there,10
RCB doesn't have an endgame plan. Who bowls at death without udana and morris??,7
What's wrong with this fielding,3
Required run rate at 7.2. PTSD guys,5
"At this stage, RCB 54-2. When you put it that way it's neck and neck",7
Get Williamson here and the match becomes super interesting..,2
Finish Washi nowww,4
Sunny G still salty about that 10 wicket loss to SRH.,12
Yuvzindra Chahal should eat bit more,3
Amazon looting us through these offers,2
"Imagine having so much money just to make shitty ads
(Jio)",6
"RCB were 54-2. Game is on boys, just that we don’t have any death bowler.",4
[deleted],5
How can Ranveer Singh be even more annoying than he already is?,7
Last 4 overs- 12/1,4
"Holder, Samad and Rashid to come. This should still be comfortable they just have to make sure that RR doesn’t go above 8.",2
Abd is an actual genius isn't he,6
Mooen and Finch to bowl some spin here,3
KXIP had Bishnoi and M.Ashwin ( 2 leggies) RCB have 2 now. PTSD increases,5
Bring in Lord Shri Raj and get Kanos And Garg out.,0
kanos either gonna hit 2 consecutive fours or get out,1
If rcb had more run this would have been over atm.,5
Put a slip!!,3
Rcb giving hope is the worst thing,11
zampa unplayable wtf,6
That was a peachhh,5
Kane chasing a low score. Super over on the cards IMO.,7
Oh now hes turning it as well. Goodnight SRH,2
Pressure on Williamson. He will know there's only place for one Yorkshire man in this team now Holder has cemented his place.,4
Williamson has quietly exacerbated our previous collapse by playing too many dots. Is letting it happen again. What the hell,1
Shankar is our best player of spin,2
"Shit fielding, Paddikal's body language indicates he doesnt want to be there. 
Come on guys. This is a knockout match. Give it your all.",5
wicket this over,1
2 runs in 2 overs off Zampa is so so bad. I get it he is bowling well but we literally can't take singles.,6
"Damn, Zampa bowling like prime Warne today..",4
Goddamn Zampa!! Now i get stoinis.,3
Guys rcb was 56 - 2 now,2
Can someone recommend me some right wing subreddits? Is r/conservative that one or is it a parody subreddit?,0
Zampa >>>>> rashid,-1
Rashid fucked us today. Didn’t get a single wicket and got hit for 6 and 4,2
C'mon give my boy Mo an over to redeem himself,1
Veganboi has actually bowled better than Rashid,6
Kohli played 4D chess by having 4 fucking spinners against SRH.,4
Zampa is bowling beautifully here...,1
Inb4 RCB's gun right arm QUICK bowler takes a wicket,6
Holder holds the key!,4
"Williamson is soaking unnecessary pressure should try and hit zampa , bowling is very predictable",1
One more wicket and RCB'S game to lose,5
AB on fire behind the wickets,1
"zampa's mullet looks awesome, so classy",-1
Why are they giving me hope just to lose it in 19.2,3
Big Nass Hussain will be moderating the Dugout debate? Expecting fireworks knowing history of Nass and Swann.,3
"Don't understand why the commentators want RCB win. Third umpire already supported them once. 
Don't understand this baised commentary.",5
Kanye Williamson,3
There are literally so many gaps around and yet Kane is only finding the fielders.,5
Four more overs of pure pain for srh...,3
I love the RCBians hope. Meanwhile [Big Daddy Holder](https://i.ibb.co/tDbWhfk/Screenshot-2020-11-06-at-10-16-40-PM.png) in the dugout.,5
Zampa bowling like second coming of Warne,8
"Kanos can take it home. 

Hope he forgets that loss against England (Yes, yes... i am playing mind games)!!!",3
What's up with zampa and stoinis,0
What a 500 iq idea to play zampa,7
"u/casualwebster please stop, you are only denying the inevitable",6
"At least this match is set up well for a ""we were 10-15 runs short"" speech from Koach.",6
I just realized that none of the matches this IPL were rain-affected. First time ever?,11
Will chahal ever get a batter out on defense??,6
"Just imagine Koach was playing like Kanos in this situation 


Whole of r/cricket - You fucking Donkey!",22
It will be really harsh on SRH if an umpiring howler ends up sending them home.,8
Guys we all thought there won't be a collapse with Williamson. But I'm still feeling they will.,4
"Devdutt Padikkal is a great rapper in the mirror  
  
Cuz his reflection is P DD.",10
Koach doing boyss boyss,1
"KXIP, DC & RCB: Real trophy is the memes we made along the way.",6
Zampa looking like every 80s teen movie protagonist,18
Man they’re scared of Zampa or what,6
Scores equal upto this point.,3
RCB GIVING ME TOO MUCH HOPE,12
Warner must be disappointed,3
The squeeze is on,1
Those runs in the last over by Siraj and Saini could turn out to be very important lol,5
LORD SIRAJ gonna win it for srh,4
Zampa has literally become Shane Warne here.,6
Where is the promised dew,8
Which was the team that folded 7-17?,7
Won’t be surprised if virgin Zampa gets Kane out here. Aussies always have an upper hand over Kiwis lmao,9
RCBs match to lose now,8
You don't need 3 dot balls to take a single.,1
Finally they are following the scripts.,7
Pressure of a play off is huge that's why you never chase. It's so simple.,5
"Holder is the only one im scared of, he can take the game away",6
Googly please,3
Damn.. virat shouting common zampa donno from where,12
Last 28 balls 14 runs ffs.,8
Kiwi Linus Sebastian is really good player of spin isn't he,4
wtf 10 extras already...,3
Please just 1 more wicket,7
Inb4 some retarded cunts compare Kanos to Dhoni,10
1-6 after 3 overs for Zamp,3
"Honestly this is why Koach is such a bad captain. 

Zampa had one bad over vs Pollard and Kishan in Dubai and so he was instantly chucked out of the team. There was no consideration given to the fact that Zampa and Chahal would succeed more than they would fail. 

Now after 15 games, he has realized that ""Oh, maybe Zampa and Chahal make a good partnership.""

Yeah, they do. No shit.",6
"Tbh, none of these times look good enough to challenge MI in the finals. The only team that can beat MI is MI itself.",7
I like this short cover and short midwicket to Williamson. Need a slip in for Garg.,2
Zampa trying to bowl  Kanos round his legs ala Strauss.,7
"Kohli is not even close to stump mic and you can hear him. Calm the f#ck down, Koach.",3
How do we pick out the outfield fielder every fucking time we beat the inner circle,7
Zampa has been brilliant,5
sexy zampa,4
For every over bowled by Zampa there is an over by Saini and Siraj to compensate,3
"RCB were 65-3 by 11 overs

We win by one run. Stop the match.",18
Why are they batting like this against RCB bowlers?,2
u/casualwebster giving hopes to rcb fans,5
Siraj's one over should be in middle instead of death,5
SRH fans reversed the reverse jinx.,10
Y'all need 68 from 54 balls and are getting nervous. Wtf SRH.,8
SRH bruh,5
Guys why did Kane Richardson go for 4 crores? Has he really improved as a t20 bowler?,5
Need to reserve spin bowling for Holder as well.,3
"Rcb fans be like: ""Dont do that. Don't give me hope.""",6
Bowl out both Zampa and Chahal here imo,3
"There was a chance of rcb not even qualifying if that noball was given and now this 

The umpires want rcb to win , the commentators want rcb to win , tired of this shit",5
Give Zampa 8 overs,9
Excellent bowling from Zampa.,3
I am once again asking for the dew,5
Damn if only RCB batted like they had brain cells,7
It's all on holder now,2
scenes if rcb wins by 2 runs.,5
I hate this. SRH are hot favourites bit RCB have just a little bit of chance that isn't allowing me to stop watching.,4
u/casualwebster the lord of r/Cricket,4
"fuck mi-csk

rcb-srh is the elite rivalry",9
Zampa bowling for his life to play ~~with~~ against Stoinis once more,13
Is Yuzi out of touch today?,2
[deleted],2
TBF Manish Padey did his job alright 24(21),2
"Tbf I have never seen Moen bowl all that much, should Koach give him a couple of overs?",2
Moeen not gonna bowl today?,2
"RCB then: Shit bowling; Good batting

RCB now: Shit batting; Good bowling

__Perfectly balanced as all things should be__",9
Kane auditioning for CSK,5
"Aussies suck against the the English ... but they always have an upper hand over the Kiwis. 

Kiwis are so tame against them lmaooo",3
It would be super humiliating for both teams if there would be a super over..,6
Kane with 50% strike rate....,1
Garg looks settled at the pitch,1
Take it Deeeeeppp^tm,3
They're playing that song from The Boys when they were driving in the car,2
"For gods sake, it's annoying to see such slow batting. 

Same players on exact conditions on another day put up 200+ scores.",1
Stoinis is probably the happiest Australian in UAE right now after watching Zampa's bowling,6
csk strike rates LMAO,3
Kane giving a tribute to Manish Pandey's 15(29) ? :P,5
Please don't give hope you idiots,5
How tf were we ahead at this point? LMAO,3
Oh boy. Zampa’s spell is making a huge dent in SRH batting. What a spell,3
He's tossing it too full,1
Either Williamson is super calm about this chase or is struggling internally to chase this...,10
RYAN STARTED THE FIRE,3
Ayo can someone give my man AB a new wikipedia picture.,4
[deleted],2
[deleted],0
Is there anyone else if Kanos gets out that can win it for SRH?,1
Remove that lame ass sunrisers chants,3
Garg is playing well reading the bowler,2
You can literally see Kohlis micromanaging draining away at Chahal,5
Now any one of them will try to attack and then he will get out and collapse will begin..... poor SRH middle order.,10
[Meanwhile dew.....](https://i.ibb.co/jgYZYsd/Screenshot-2020-11-06-at-10-20-14-PM.png),3
Kanos with all the dot balls is digging a hole for the batsmen who follow to fall in.,5
"I want to time travel to 18th over
Even though the game is dull now, it is giving me panic attack",3
Lets goooooooooooooooo,2
That was coming,2
Letsss fucking gooo boysss,5
Good thing is they are rotating the strike. Just play chahal and zampa out and the game is done.,2
Hold Up,1
[removed],-13
Finally Yuzi. Well done.,4
Someone give u/casualwebster his shizo meds,2
Classic Chahal wicket.. stupid Garg....,6
"Dear sub, both sets of fans were not reverse jinxing before the match . We were saying the truth all this time.",44
"I'll be honest, none of these teams can face off MI. All of them are professional chokers :)",18
What a shit show by Garg. What an absolute filth.,-2
Garg out. :(,3
Holder is tha last hope,4
Zampa MOTM?,5
"Good stuff, zampa, very cool",8
"Great, out. Way to go, hyderabad",3
"Kane should bat just like he is batting - Holder, Rashid and Samad to come",3
feelsgood.gif,4
68/4 vs 67/4,6
Zampa is everywhere and I'm loving it!,7
Lesgooo lads,4
LETS GO BOYS!!!,5
Why parg whyyyyyy,3
Field placement is perfect by kohli.,4
I have no doubt in my mind SRH is going to lose today. Not sure why RCB fans think there is a doubt,5
"Yep, no one saw that coming, such a shock.",4
Leggies helping each other,3
Screw th is,3
All right then. Bye.,1
And y’all were wondering why SRH fans are so damn pessimistic,5
Told yall that Garg will fuck us up,3
srh is kill,5
GG RCB,1
Took the bait.,10
Priyam u tit,4
RCB r u giving me hope just to take it away?,13
Garg ya stupid,0
Williamson has to find his touch ASAP if we're to win this. Fucking hell.,3
Chahal and his wide slow flighters! Name a better love story,8
Shit Holder is coming in,3
"Risers, hit a hundred and I'll be happy.",3
Hows the Umpiring today?,0
"How many wickets he gets just by tossing these wide ones!!

Yuzi you Beauty!!",8
FUCK FORGOT ABOUT HOLDER,2
 What was that song in the background..something like thunder?,1
Damn it. Chokers.,3
What. Is. HAPPENING,2
A shot that shouts inexperience,6
[deleted],-2
Oh wow! How did Zampa manage to hold onto THAT!,8
This is why...This is why srh fans are soo pessimistic.,10
Classic Chahal dismissal,9
"Ah yes, the chokers",6
New player comes in takes 5 balls to get off start.,3
"If holder wins this for srh, I'll fucking abuse any srh crybaby who complains about Mitch marsh getting injured",9
They've turned Zampa into prime Warne,14
He took the bait,2
[deleted],5
Crotch catch,1
SRH doing SRH things,1
"RCB FAN: i fear no one
except Jason holden",5
"**11.5** Chahal to Garg, OUT, **chipped straight to sweeper cover!** **67-4**

PK Garg c Zampa b Chahal 7 (14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00",1
I have seen chahal getting wickets with that same ball so many times now.,7
RCB doing a reverse-choke???,5
Zampa took the catch off his dick 😁😁😂,8
Almost dropped it phew,5
"""Not comfortable at all"" xD",3
Should have sent samad you mofos,4
Inb4 Holder 30(14),5
PLEASE LET RCB WIN PLEASE,8
EE SAALA CUP NAAMDE,4
Rcb fans reverse jinxing i like it,3
Time for Kane to show his masterclass and take them home,3
"Chahal strikes by dangling the carrot again, so many batsmen have gotten out to this plan, bowl a few tight balls, and then bowl a flighted leg break outside off.",2
Garg is not IPL level yet. Needs a couple of Ranji seasons to mould him.,2
This game is getting way too close. Hope Kane and Holder carry them to victory,4
No no no. U can’t do that @RCBBowlers,2
Just why? He was playing so well and just a moment of impatience and he's gone,2
Where my SRH reverse jynxing squad at show your magic!!!,1
So the final is on a weekday ? They couldn't play 2 playoffs ina day ?,4
Wowwwwwww oiiiiiiii,2
The moment you saw the flight you knew a wicket was coming,2
"Oh no, Warner was not out, it clearly just nicked his balls.",4
"**When Kanos 9(17)**

r/cricket:Oh dear,oh dear gorgeous 

**If Pandey 9(17)**

r/cricket: you fucking Donkey",43
Expression on holder’s face. FFS I have to score now,5
Siraj and Saini really helped us with those additional 15 odd runs,6
fuck this shit team,0
Please bowl a googly first up to holder,1
Damn holder in. Need one more wicket for rcb to hopefully secure this win.,1
Haha it would be even more funny if Kanos played till the end haha,0
[deleted],2
Garg has been such a disappointment.,1
Gg rcb,1
Fucking chahal. He made him play that shot. Brilliant!,3
If you can’t chase 130 what are you even good for,4
BRING IT ONNN,1
Did Chahal just groom Kohli hahahaha,4
Best Bait ever,2
Lol SRH... They prepared for MI but RCB came out of syllabus,6
I choked on my food watching that wicket.,3
Rcb is doing srh to srh,2
Googly time,1
What is Garg's role in the team btw?,1
Couldn't ask for 2 calmer heads at the crease,2
I apologise to all SRH fans for saying that they were being very pessimistic about their batting order. The sunrisers become sun setters right after Warner gets out.,7
Low scoring thrillers are the best.,2
This fucker garg took 14 balls for it,1
SRH fans you reversed jinxed the reverse jinx. Now just shut the fuck up,2
"My wish has been granted.

I wished I wished 10 million euros.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jp3yo7/match_thread_eliminator_royal_challengers/gbcxci4/",3
Damn garg. This is exactly what you didn't have to do. Just take the singles dammit,6
"Last 2 recognizable batsmen are in, maybe Samad can tonk a bit but I haven't seen enough of him to rate him tbh",1
"_Chahal pitches the ball outside off_

Batsmen: Sigh. I must resign.",4
"Wooohoooooo! Spinners doing the magic here. Just get Williamson now. 
Of course there is the dangerous holder yet to play. 
But it's looking good for RCB!",3
[u/casualwebster](https://www.reddit.com/u/casualwebster/) more like staunchwebster,3
How goddamn key was Saha to this lineup.,2
Yay we get to face rcb I guess...,2
[Hmm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jp3yo7/match_thread_eliminator_royal_challengers/gbcdade?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),1
"Again one more ""future of Indian cricket"" is dimwitted",4
I FUCKING LOVE IPL,5
Pls Holder 0 (1),2
SRH choking against RCB just like they choked vs KXIP chasing 126. Every version of RCB!,2
"Seriously how can dhoni think of advertising for bharat matrimony, it is very low",3
Inb4 Jason destroys zampa's figures,2
Brain dead shit from SRH. How do they shit the bed in every low total chase?,6
YJB woulda scored 132 (27) by now just saying,5
It's done bois.. We ain't gonna win from here,0
Kane with a SR of ~50 and Garg with a SR of 50... What SR will Holder end up with?,1
"Ah Yes, CHOKERS BUT DISIARAV TO QUALIFY",5
west indians  not very good at spin :(,5
"Chahal and Kohli 😏, angry AB noises 😠",1
Lmao RRR to 8,6
Ffs I hate having hope,6
This is the partnership that decides the game now,5
Chahal must have back problems from carrying this team.,8
SRH for you. Scoring 150 targets with 10 wickets in hand and struggling to score 120+ targets.,11
Will lose by 20 runs,2
"Boys and girls, looks like we're gonna have another Meme Team Derby in the next match",3
Wtf SRH.,4
ಠ_ಠ,2
Siraj still has the best batting performance in this game so far,2
"Don’t do that, don’t give me hope",3
I think Kane has invited the scoreboard pressure on every single batsman. Not a very smart strategy from the usually smart guy.,5
Indian middle-order batsmen choking in playoffs is a constant mood tbh.,9
 9(17)....what does Williamson think this is? The Nevada Premier League?,6
GET HOLDER PLEASE,2
Zampa contributing through his bat,6
Kanos to the rescue.,3
"2 captains at crease, hopefully the experince helps.They have to take it through tho. I can’t see samad or rashid carrying an innings",8
This is exactly the situation for which Kane was brought into the squad and bairstow was left out,2
"Nah this Holder guy is so Tall amd Fierce, me too afraid",19
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",16
Damn saha was so important,7
Wtf!!! You can beat MI but shit your pants during RCB?!!!!,8
Rcb is going to make a lot of people including me eat their words it seems,2
Finch and AB rotating strike not letting dots build was so valuable to RCB.,2
It would be nice to watch Chokers vs Chockers in QF-2 for one more time.,1
"It’s matches like this where I’m convinced that ABD is from a different planet. This pitch is clearly super tough to bat on, and this madlad just goes “What pitch?”",3
1 Hyderabadi vs 11 Hyderabadi who will win? #MiyaMagic,2
If only 3D and Saha werent injured,2
Zampa is a lovely man,2
Do you know who scares me the most with the bat? Rashid Khan. Watch him fuck us over with a cheeky 32 (18),4
"Josh ads shouldn't be allowed FFS, kids will be waitching this",6
Chahal would be a great internet troll considering his ability to bait people into going after him.,6
This shows how important that wicket of Warner was...,11
I say bowl out Zampa,3
Chahal+zampa > Rashid today.,3
"Why can't these youngsters rotate strike or take calculated risk?  
.  
They just loft the ball in the air.",2
[deleted],2
STOP THE COUNT of SRH's runs. We win.,5
C'mon lads. Play it out till the 15th .,1
One holder is 2 chahal and 1 Warner,3
Both team fan bois are gonna reverse jinx hard now guys just wait,2
Zampa with that clutch thigh catch,1
"Dude, garg took a really unnecessary risk",3
"Even if Required RR goes above 10-12/over, trust Saini, Siraj to make it cakewalk for the opposition.",3
Around 13th over they should bowl Siani for one over as after so many overs of spin Kanos can be susceptible to the change of pace.,1
"Hey guys, just came back. My stream is not working properly. There's no visuals, just a black screen with HOPE written in bold",3
Holder is like double chahals height lol,7
"Just play off the 2 remaining overs from zampa and Chalal, we chase the target easily after that.",2
Williamson looks settled at the pitch,0
If kanos wins this then among the Rcb fans he'll become the most hated loved man,3
SRH is pulling off an RCB whereas RCB is pulling off an SRH.,10
We missed Saha so damn much.,2
Warner would have taken a gajillion 2s by now. Absolutely clueless batting by Garg as usual.,6
What is Moeen’s role in this team again?,1
RCB literally meme'ing their way into the finals,4
How many wickets has Chahal gotten from the slower loopy delivery outside off? Insane. You'd think coaches would prep batsmen for that exact ball.,5
Holder is like 2 feet taller than everyone else lmao,1
Theses are the overs now for SRH,0
No please don't give me hope you idiots,1
"Never thought Williamson will lose a match for us. I'm gonna cry myself to sleep. To all those people who thought we were reverse jinxing, FFS we weren't. We know our team",5
SRH can still win. RCB has only 2 fast bowlers and 3 overs of which 1 is of Lord Siraj,3
Here comes MO,4
The Beard That Is Feared!!!!,3
"This has become Chahal's bread and butter delivery in IPL, flight it up outside off stump, slow in the air and wicket.",9
"If they get Holder cheaply, it’ll be RCB’s game to lose",6
WTF Bois we still in the game,5
"Don’t worry SRH, only two more overs left of Zampa and Chahal.

Saini will be thrown out of park.",4
OH NO MOEEN WILL GET SPANKED THIS OVER,9
Srh to easily win this after zampa and Chahal bowl out . Thanks for the hope though,6
Why wasn't Bairstow picked over Williamson?,2
Non-existing middle order vs Non-existing death bowling.,5
"I love Kanos

But i dont trust a Kiwi in knockout match",12
I fuckin told yaaa! I kid you not I switched it back on after 10 minutes and there's the wicket!! Fuckin hell,3
The only way I'll rate nattu above siraj is if he can scoop a ball towards fine leg for a four and wins srh the match /s,7
How huge is this ground?? Are my mental calibrations off or would that have been a 6 in half of the Indian stadiums? Chinnaswamy especially.,4
Garg lookin like puberty is yet to hit him..,1
"For all SRH injury crybabys

KKR played without russ in 2017 and played without STARK in 2018",0
SRH's only hope is Navdeep braindead Saini,1
What a turnaround since Warner’s wicket. Kohli almost ran out of time too.,1
Tonk Moeen plzzz,1
Moeen. not having a good game so far...holder should line him up.,0
"In Williamson, I Trust.",1
"Yoo SRH peeps, where do we hide tonight?",2
waiting for Kano v2018.,2
Come on Mo,2
SRH have given so many chances to Garg just hasn’t produced bar one game.,7
"It’s laughable for me how much Williamson gets sucked off on this sub. He’s absolutely trash under pressure in t20’s. Eats up balls, doesn’t rotate the strike, doesn’t look to attack.",2
Zampa saved his IPL career.,3
Why isn't Saha playing? Is he injured?,2
"These two need to get a 60 run partnership, pretty much.",1
"SRH is what you get when you search the dictionary for ""win by 10 wickets or bust""",8
Mo please bowl better than you batted earlier,0
"Two of the more mature cricketers out there, in a run a ball chase. Not a problem..",3
Lots of teams have been lacking players who can score runs on a slow pitch - that's why MI are so strong; much of their batting is capable of hitting boundaries without pace in the ball and on a slowing wicket.,7
MI: so which one of you three jokers want to come get fucked in the finals ?,11
Bonus over for SRH,1
These performances by the top 4 confirm thats it’s going to be extreeeeemely easy for MI :(,8
Garg has done nothing to justify his place in the team. Dont know why they keep going with him,4
Kill me,5
Lmao Zampa was dying inside cause that ball just hit him in the nuts and Siraj on his top was like yaayy,6
Who's gonna bowl at death?,1
Rashid can bat pretty well btw,1
"SRH : I like my chase like I like my memes

&#x200B;

SPICY",6
I have no hopes for srh now,0
Is holder a good player of spin?,1
Isn't Samad meant to be good against spin? Why's Holder in ahead of him?,2
Koach is high.,1
Moeen just give us 1 wicket as a compensation for the freehit wicket,5
Zampa looked like he did not want to be hugged by Siraj after that catch lol,6
[deleted],4
Chahal casually picking off grass from Kohli's hair while also maintaing a serious conversation with him was so cute,2
Garg's footwork when is playing an aerial shot looks so awkward. He looks like he is on the front foot but his entire weight is actually on the back.,1
Mo nearly picking Kanos,1
Now this is a classic CSK Spin Choke,3
Bowling Moeen,2
"Lmao Moeen is gonna bowl now. 

Rest In Peace RCB",0
this has nothing to do with rcb bowling and everything with srh choking. FFS just finish the match my man jason,4
Why Saha not playing today?,5
Williamson doing exactly what Manish did vs KXIP LOL,4
Kudos to third umpire for giving such brave decision under pressure when he could've easily got away by giving the batsman BenEfiT Of DouBt.,9
WTF Kane.. definitely auditioning for CSK,7
Run rate about to reach 9,3
Will it be English Mooen Ali today or Pakistani Moeen Ali?,0
What the actual fuck are these dots,8
Kanos pls this is getting unacceptable.,7
Kanos wtf?,4
Williamson bruh at least take a fucking single. Don't pile up the dots against an offie.,1
So happy that Siraj is showing good consistency. He may have to fill in for Bhuvi in tests,7
Kane to csk confirmed,5
"Every RCB player wanna eat Zammpa, lol",3
Kanos needs 20 overs to get settled,9
"SRH: Look at me, I'm the choker now.",10
Told ya,7
"Everybody trolled Koach for playing 4 Spinners 

TBF Moeen Ali is playing more as a Batsman",7
Kanos has pushed the RR to 8.  He is making the batsmen at the other end scape goats with his slow batting.,4
Moeenuralitharan,11
Unbelievable how shit Williamson is,0
Why change the bowling up. Even bowl sundar over Ali since he's not gonna be used up anyway,0
"And Englishman bowling to a Kiwi, keeper is a Saffa and non striker is from the Caribbean. Truly a global tournament",25
As a RCB and Kanos fan this hurts :(,11
Kanos must REALLY back himself to finish this match considering the pace he's going at..,4
Are NZ supposed to play a Test series in the next month? Why is Kanos practicing?,9
I love how Gavaskar doesn’t like Moeen Ali either,-6
Why Moin Ali? Should have brought Washington back,-1
Williamson is doing a Pandey today,3
13 off 23 nice,3
Why are we like this?,5
Zampa/Chahal vs Holder is going to be massive.,4
"If SRH lose the match, it is on Kanos",7
Thala Williamson,2
Maybe its time to get bairstow in for Kane.,2
This has to be Williamson’s day if SRH fancy themselves to be playing DC.,3
If only we had 150,5
If they keep on doing this Virat's gonna bowl the next,3
Murali Karthik took so long to respond that I forgot for what he’s replying for,5
"62 off 44 isn’t impossible, SRH shouldn’t be this worried. It’s Williamson and Holder, not Shreyas and Shaw at the crease. Chill.",2
Just put me out of my misery please,5
Here comes the giant on crease,2
Win or lose RCB forever. Never expected them to choke SRH who have been on a great form.,2
People were touting this SRH team as the team to beat MI?,5
Kanos might get out the first ball he tries to hit hard,7
Supreme choke,4
Kane will carry srh boys why are you so worried?,1
if srh loses today MI should just lift the cup and save the others from embarrassment,4
"If Kane Williamson gets out, SRH are done for imo",6
"If SRH lose this, it'll be 100% on Williamson.",7
"Kanos is doing a great job of auditioning for Dhoni's replacement.

All he has to do is tuk tuk this to the 19th over and win it in the penultimate ball.",3
Tonight's special Hyderabad 'choke' biryani,3
"Kanos, building up that energy for a huge LOAD of Awesomeness...",3
RCB losing the polls cause everyone stopped watching.,8
Please don't bowl mo second order,4
Kanos playing forward defense in a T20 for 10 balls has caused all this pressure.,3
Manish-esque innings form kane,2
Are these many dot balls normal?,1
Don't mind the dots as long as Holder is around. He can tonk 2-3 hits to level it up.,2
Pandey would be getting absolutely slaughtered if he played the innings Williamson is rn,20
"Williamson, this is not test cricket",7
Goddamn are SRH really gonna choke this one away? Out RCB RCB themselves?,3
Daddy Willy just playin with us✊💦,2
"Wait Sundar has overs left. 

Chahal has 1

Zampa has 1.",2
CMON BOYS WE JUST NEED TO SURVIVE 7 OVERS,6
:|,1
WilliamThalason... Taking the game too deep..,2
Thalason,3
Kane will kill srh if he gets out....,1
I know for a fact after stinking up this chase Williamson is not gonna take srh home.,1
PTSD,3
"So, it looks like Saha is the real MVP of this side. No Saha, No porty :(",5
People don’t understand the polls. The question isn’t who is the better spinner. The question is who is more important to their team. It’s clearly Chahal. SRH has other good bowlers. RCB has had poor bowlers through the years,11
"As bad and untimely as Morris’ injury is, at least it finally got Kohli to actually use Siraj with the new ball.",7
"Before I became u/pussydestroyer100,  I used to be a pro version of the simp from that Dairy Milk ad.",13
David Warner must be feeling depressed. His middle order has a bad habit of betraying him.,3
From here on they should get one boundary per over at least,0
That siraj and Saini masterclass at the end may help RCB!,0
3 maximums and its run a ball,5
SRH have scored 24 off the last 42. Now they need 60 off the next 42.,6
Why is Bhogle giving condescending vibes?,1
Nervy smile from DAVEY WARNER,3
I'm sorry but Priyam Garg is the most overrated young player in India,4
Does anyone know if sahas injury means he is out just for the game or is it worse than that?,5
Yeah breakup hurts but Kanos wtf,3
BOWL OUT ZAMPA,1
"Wud be fun to seen English moeen defending againsy West Indian Holder

2016 WT20 Final PTSD intensifies",3
Zampa with that economy.,1
BATDEEP^TM,7
Saini would've been much better had he not been brain dead,5
Someone better tell he's playing in a T20 match and not a Test match. I think he's confused.,5
[deleted],10
got to give it to rcb bowlers. Been stepping up lately to defend these shit scores,13
SRH getting knocked out is basically a confirmed MI trophy,12
Poor bowlers are trying their best. I cannot for the life of me understand why RCB batsmen are shitting the bed so consistently,3
"Wait, is that Pandey behind Kane's mask?",3
I am only watching match for eternal Kane disappointment,-2
RCB is winning this. No experienced batsmen left after this pair.,-1
"With Saha out, bringing in Bairstow was such an obvious pick... but noooooo they want cute face Williamson instead",5
RCB fans reverse jinxing.,4
"Alright, it's RCB'S game to lose now.",-2
Imagine if Rcb had just gotten 20 more runs,10
Ee saala cup naamde back on menu bitches,15
SRH’s only hope is Siraj at this point,10
RCB be like its not choking if you lost expectedly,7
Bruh wtf,0
WTF!! one sided match soch ke tv bandh kar dia tha...,5
Let's see how they play after tea break,0
"saha was our lucky charm guys, we lost it today",5
"Don't worry guys, Kane will get some mail-in runs which will put him well ahead of the required rate",9
Why didn't they bring zampa?,-2
Didn't know we would miss 3D so much today,4
2 captains at crease now - WI & NZ,3
"The moment Kane played five dot balls to start his innings, I could see the SRH ship hitting the iceberg.",1
Wtf happened ? Srh were 40/1 and I come back to this,1
"Why do SRH take down big targets with ease but limp along during small targets?

Their kryptonite is weird AF.",4
Ok who is that who shouted catchhh,2
I have a very bad feeling about this chase.,2
Is this the worst middle order in IPL,3
just 2 sixes required to ease off the pressure.,3
"Williamson clearly increasing the pressure on other batsmen

Thala like innings",5
"RRR 9 now, its now or never",0
bro wtf why is srh not accelerating NOW,4
Yo Kanos so nice hearted he’s trying his hard to gift 🎁 a win for the depressed RCB fans,5
People were shitting on any other player playing slowly. Fucking hypocrites!!,0
advertising the mask while wearing it wrong,5
No way SRH can win from here. Is there any chance?,1
"I wonder why SRH persists with Priyam Garg instead of Abhishek Sharma, He eats up deliveries and gets out at crucial stages...Such a Let down with the Bat this Garg chap was for SRH.",3
They've made this a 10 RPO chase somehow,4
"Even after that 126 debacle, SRH playing too cautiously. smh",3
I have high hopes that Williamson will pull off a Lord tewatia. #Believe,2
RR is not a problem for holder if he doesnt get out,3
Pumped up Kohli with the dives when not needed,4
"How the fuck did RCB suddenly get 16 overs of available quality spin. 

We are fucked aren't we?",6
SHOULD KOHLI BOWL CHAHAL AND ZAMPA OUT?,1
"Mate as if the match wasn't bad enough, they remind us of the Punjab match.",6
we had 48 runs after 6 overs. 7.2 overs later and we're scored 24 more...,5
Is the strategic timeout over?,1
Saha not being their has really affected this.,3
"Since DC is playing on the same pitch, they should bring in Sandeep Lamichhane for Sams.",3
Dhoniconda spirit lives on,0
KKR died for this :/,2
"Just a six lads, just a six",1
Wow RCB were actually 10 runs ahead at this point,3
Wow RR's closing in on 9 for a chase of 130,3
Those 13 runs in the last over proving to be crucial,3
"Kanos this is not test man, I'm gonna cry nowww
Edit: okay hit more 6s like that !",2
Come on KW we believe in you,1
Is this.....hope?,5
Rcb need to bowl zampas over next otherwise next over could be a big one,4
Only thing RCB fans should worried of now is Siraj bowling in the death.,7
RRR above 9. Hit the panic button now lmao.,5
No pressure there. All is required is two decent overs.,2
"Fuck Me kanos supporters but i am gonna say this

MORGAN > KANOS",3
Koach should have gone for the catch ?,5
Lara roasting Kane,1
"Only way SRH gonna win 
Virat kohli  bowls one over 
Jason holder hits 30 in that over.",4
David Warner is still smiling. He is like a puppy dog in IPL.,6
Maar bencho,1
RCB has pulled back things pretty well. Koach's spin surplus gamble has worked so far. But they need to get Williamson. He can't stay till the end.,1
Shitty ball,1
"Well, I will not cheer, he should atleast even out his run rate",1
Sundar having such a bad day,2
"RCB brothers,let the dark flow of reverse jinxing flow through us one last time.Lets reverse jinx it.The final is now,we have to beat SRH,come on brothers land me a hand and let the dark flow of reverse jix flow through us one last time.",3
Daddy  Love Machine Williamson with a BIG DICK SIX✊💦,2
"Thank Kane, please go on.",2
Even the commentators are referencing the 126 chase 🤣🤣,4
Kane tewatia,4
There goes our hope,8
Shot,2
"You can't have 4 spinners in the team. This is cheating. Petition to bring in Dubeji.

Jokes aside, good thinking from RCB as they know their pacers are going to struggle towards the end.",3
oh shit,3
"The required rate is almost 10. Considering how slow the pitch is, it's going to be difficult",2
Kanos is too damn good too bend over. Have faith SRH fans.,3
MOTHERFUCKIN HELL,2
Shitty ball,2
William's son playing the exact inning Pandey played against Punjab,2
Yes babyyyyyyyy,2
Come on kanos.,3
"Kane is hitting out and getting out soon

Edit : Hitting has started",2
Classic NZ slog sweep,1
Hell yeah kanos,2
[deleted],-1
That's it. The match is over.,3
Smart to save Zampa and Chahal maybe you even give them the death overs,3
that's one down Kanos,1
Finally a boundary,1
WE ARE NOW FUCKED,7
so its over?,8
Lettss goooo kanoss,3
Sundar should bowl slower through the air. It's a slow pitch,1
Williamson hitting a 6 is weird to see,3
Kanos was done looking at the Clown in the Cred board,9
Kanos is inevitable,9
Williamson doing exactly a Tewatia,7
So it's definitely confirmed that they can hear the dugout commentators on the field,5
Lara was going right about Kane slowing the team down and as if on cue he hits a six,8
Sundar bro chose wrong match to go for runs.,3
Lol Lara just saying Kane needs to be aggressive and he hits a six.,16
Not a Sundar delivery,5
Sundar be like yeah I'll bowl any length now kane is too scared to hit.,6
Please guys just get 1 wicket and make us RCB fans happy for the last time this season,5
Canon sundar,0
None of these teams can beat Mumbai,5
Williamson shut Brian Lara up with that six,4
"If I could get a Rupee for everytime Lara says ""That's unbelievable""..",7
"As long as Jason holder is there SRH are favourites IMO. 
Only 3 pacer overs are remaining and I think Jason  can just smash all the spinners while kane helps with a boundary or two .",0
We're making a bit of a cunt of this.,4
‘Man loses last shred of hope he didn’t even know he had’,10
Kane misses playing test cricket,3
Chahal boi is very good at swooping,4
Lara talks so much sense. How is he not being used by any team or franchise as a mentor?,12
Poor delivery from Sundar. Allowed Kanos to relieve all that pressure,2
Whatever happens today Im happy we came into the playoffs .,11
~~Kanos~~ Thanos reducing RCB hopes to half with one hit,10
All abord the kane train,7
Match over lads . Kanos to win it for srh,8
"6 Overs left.  1 each by Chahal, Zampa, Sani.  2 by Siraj

Edit: Mixed up Siraj and saini's overs",7
"Sorry Kanos. This is my official apology. Carry on, King.",5
"Two international captains in the middle, you'd trust them to finish the job",8
"The thing with SRH is that the lower order is pretty inexperienced and not that great either, will need Holder to do something with bat too",5
5th trophy for Mumbai is looking inevitable,9
Do not bowl ali,1
Why is sundar bowling like this today,3
Such a stupid innings from Kane. It was run a ball when he walked in and he’s made it an almost impossible chase,5
"Kane = Govinda

CSK =  Cred",2
Can't blame Harsha getting excited. He's from Hyderabad. After all we're humans. Atleast he isn't biased.,9
[removed],5
"Will saha be fit next match, if there is one?",3
Need 15-16 from the remaining 12 balls of Chahal and Zampa. Get that without losing any wickets and we should be the favorites,5
In before Kanos apology thread,8
[deleted],1
I now see why both SRH and RCB fans have zero faith in their teams.,28
"My prediction, Kanos takes this game with a 54*",3
Please bowl a googly please bowl a googly,1
Chahal v. Williamson will be a great contest.,2
Birmingham Phoenix's Kane Williamson vs Birmingham Phoenix's Adam Zampa and Moeen Ali,3
10 extras already in 81. Almost criminal,4
I love you Kanos but please get out,5
"Kanos !! 

The only player whose presence in the lineup makes more effect than when he is on the pitch!!

I love you, but you have been overrated.",-4
"Koach needs to be more aggressive in his fields. He needs a wicket.

If Kanos and Holder stay, SRH win.",6
"Where were you when kkr ded.

I was at home eating popcon when 

Phone ring, kkr is kil by tuk tuk srh 

""No""",4
Alright guys. Holder is MOM today. He will save SRH with a matching winning knock. Plus he got 3 wickets. today is his day,4
Why did Washi pick today to be an off day,6
Sundar has 2. Options are plenty.,1
We need to survive 2 overs of Zampa and Chahal.,2
I would not trust Siraj or Saini against a set Williamson. I'd risk it with spin,1
Watching Warner makes me happy,4
The only reason I still watch the IPL is to see pissed off Kohli,11
"Either Zampa is gonna get tonked, or wickets incoming.

Edit: Well, that was underwhelming.",1
A batsmen upping the ante after getting bogged down this IPL? Where did the sun come out from today?,2
Someone start the RCB Sadness thread already,7
Too little too late Williamson?,0
"Kanos has put unnecessary pressure on himself. If he gets out now without finishing the match for SRH, he'll only have himself to blame. This is the worst I've seen him bat in a long time.",4
"Why isn't Negi in the field? Could make a huge difference, take off Dube ffs",3
Holder makes the wickets look comically small,6
KANOS IS MAKING ME FEEL UNEASY,4
[deleted],6
"No one

Absolutely no one

*SRH or RCB does something bad*

Some guy: KKR died for this.",17
daddy Holder living dangerously,0
"So RCB played really well but couldn't make it to finals, accept now that we will lose.2020 wasn't our year but now we have a few positives from this season.So let's hope for the 14th season now in 2021.6 months to go for IPL 2021,meet y'all there.",2
"C'mon Zampa, get one more wicket.",4
Let's see if saving zampa pays off,2
This is what I love about guys like kanos or coach. As long as they’re there you don’t panic. Everyone knows kanos is an amazing batsman and if you don’t think he can accelerate you don’t watch him enough,4
I would have bowled siraj all 4 over up front but they only have 2 fast bowlers,4
20 more runs and with 4 spinners on this Chepauk like pitch would have sealed the deal for RCB.,9
I think SRH can easily win,2
The match which will  take Koach into God captaincy mode 🔥🔥,12
Zampa has done alright.,3
Don't jinx kanos please. Let him have this at least.,3
"zampa is written as ""jamba"" in tamil broadcast",9
Zamps 1 wicket to meet stoinis,6
Where’s the dew we were promised?,2
"Break this Partnership

Initiate Collapse.exe",6
"Gayle

Lewis

Simmons

Pooran

Hetmyer

Pollard

Russell

Braithwaite

Holder 

Narine

Bowler


Man Windies, if there are no issues, have to be clear favorites for the World T20",23
It’s all over for RCB,4
Did SRH bat badly or this just isn't a easy pitch to bat on?,1
I think it’s time for finch to bowl.,2
Get williamson and game over,2
Adios everyone,1
They are gonna chase this down. We have seen this happen many times before,6
Srh have played this over well,0
So the dew hasn't settled in..,1
Tailor-made match for vintage Dhoni.,8
"Karthik trying to take down Bhogle, well good luck",3
I need someone to cunt the shit out of Zampa!,4
Jeez that 6 from Kane was good enough to get RCB super nervous again. PTSD is real,15
RCB fans are gonna go super crazy once they win this....,5
Kanos is going to ask Holder to just survive Zampa and Chahal. Don't see anything drastic happening.,3
Look at those dots,2
"Holder has chipped 4 of the 6 balls he has faced.

Koach needs to bring his fielders in",5
Hot star numbers kinda low. I remember seeing 8m+ consistently during the playoffs in 2018,10
That's it RCB ain't winning tonight,5
How naive of me to think that the scriptwriters would let an eliminator be one sided,8
Jew comes in when the check books comes out. JK,4
"If RCB win this, Siraj should get MOM more for last over flourish than the 2 wickets.",10
Zamps has bowled a class spell here,8
SRH fans itna kyu panic ho rhe hai. SRH aaram se jeet jayega!,3
Should've done this from the start. Too many fucking dots early on to let the run rate go out of control for absolutely no reason,8
Zampa 1-12(4) 😳,10
[deleted],4
I swear Iyer makes us win in Q2 I will forgive him for that horrible ad,6
SRH needs just one big over,6
Rashid-esque figures by Zampa,9
Those are excellent numbers by Zamps...,5
Next over by chahal or saini?,1
GIVE CHAHAL THE BALL,3
Damn Zampa really put his all in to see Stoinis,6
lord siraj's last over batting giving RCB the edge,2
"5 overs left...So 2 from Saini, 1 each from Siraj Chahal and Sundar? Or 2 from Siraj?",2
45 of 30 wtf really. from a position of strength down to this,2
"If RCB win this, Zampa is a good shout for the MOM",4
more people would watch if kohli had a mic,6
"16 - Mo Ali

17 - Chahal

18 - Saini

19 - Siraj

20 - Saini

This looks ideal",3
Lmao the Final's on a Tuesday? Kinda anticlimatic,2
Wow Zampa,2
Rcb pls win today,2
Zampa 1-12 off his four overs. He has done alright says Harsha,6
If Kane carries us to the finish line I will forego biryani for a month,2
Aah! Even the flags are not interested.,2
A man like Kohli trying to intimidate Holder is hilarious to watch,9
At least this is still watchable for a neutral like me.,6
Wave one of spin gone. Chahal remains.,1
Sunder 2 overs for 21,2
"Such a contrast, today's and yesterday's match",2
Come on! You need a more aggressive field to get dots.,1
We need a 15 run over soon.,3
[deleted],1
Why didn't Moeen bowl another over?,1
This over is make or break for both sides,1
When I play the chip shot Holder just played it barely crosses the pitch and when Holder does it crosses the infield easily. Not fair.,2
"Ngl.. Parthiv Patel not getting a single game this season is pretty disappointing to watch, he was the OG Pocket dynamite",2
1-12 in 4overs by Zampa 👏,3
S~~R~~MH,3
Typical RCB innings now one Siraj/Saini over and boom that's the game.,3
Warners smiling he knows the script. SRH gonna win last over,2
"Saint has a lot of responsibility here. He will have to bowl well in the twonover he gets, cannot go for too many runs.",0
Just need to play out this over,1
"Even Siraj has better economy than Sundar, what happened to washi?",4
Should have given Moeen another over,3
Our resident weatherman Harsha with the good news for RCB.,2
"Siraj absolute GOAT all rounder

we underestimated his abilities",7
Both of these are great test players. Thus extremely sensible and capable to handle the pressure.,5
Chahal must be so happy there’s no wind blowing,3
1 more wicket and curtains for us,4
6 off this over with no wicket and I think we’ll do it. This over will win the game for either side,4
Holders can take this away in one over I think,3
That's it boys it's over for RCB,3
"C’mon chahal boy, do your thing",3
RCB defending a low total against SRH will be something no one else would have seen coming. Usually it's the other way round.,12
"Zampa 4 overs 12/1, damn i take back my words about changes in Playing XI.",6
Is Moeen a part timer or more of an all rounder,2
"This over decides the game.

If Chahal picks one of these two, RCB should win",6
4 overs 1-12 is really good  by Zampa,5
Big Dick Williamson,2
Tapping it around like a test match,1
Imagine if CSK had qualified and were playing on this pitch,4
Stfu DJ,6
SRH need two big overs ASAP.,2
I am sure they will play out Chahal,3
I wonder how well would SRH bowlers figures be if they bowled against their own team,8
WHY is Koach not bringing the fielders a bit closer. They're sneaking singles,10
"The despair from both sides in this thread

Lovely",13
[deleted],1
Yeah might as well call it a night. RCB have this in the bag.,2
I thought you couldn't do a wicket alert after 15th?,1
30-33 off last 3 SRH should be comfortable,1
Ali should've bowled this,0
This is awful. Holder is terrible against spin and Kanos is just piling up pressure. Worst time for a SRH fan to watch the game.,3
Kane taking all those singles just to trigger Koach,3
Bc hit some 4s,1
Wicket in this over is absolute must for RCB to win this game. No more leg spin after this,7
slipping away from rcb,6
"9 rpo is easy, SRH have got this",4
"No matter how he rotates his bowlers in the remaining overs, Koach is gonna get shat upon in the comments here despite him being spot on with his captaincy decisions tonight.",8
"Now they're able to magically score a run a ball this over while getting 2 in other overs. 

Get a move on, you faced enough balls to settle in.",3
RCB is just IPL's Tottenham,7
Make or break over.,3
I can say for a fact that either RCB or SRH will win this game,16
"I had a day as bad as sundar once, not fun",11
Really bad game for washi,5
Haha even Kohli doesn’t trust Shit Ali,0
Zamps has done well today,2
KOACH BRING THE DAMN FIELDERS IN,3
"BREAKING: Kohli alleges run fraud!  
  
""Everytime we are leading, suspicious boundaries appear, MAGICALLY, for SRH!""",13

"If srh play out this over, should be an easy win for them",1
How one six almost changed the game,2
"They are going to attack Pace, and they can easily get 30+ runs in the two overs",1
JASON HOLDER REMEMBER THE NAMEE!!,0
"They're gonna play out Chahal, might as well bring the field in",1
Y'all know what.Both sides extend the game till 12.DC will be knocked out hence.Both of y'all will play again in q2.,1
Dube is like a discount discount discount  discount discount discount Hardik,4
"Super over

you heard it here first",9
How an earth is that not a wide!,8
Get a wicket ffs we don’t have death bowlers today 😭😭😭,5
"This is the worst batting performance in IPL history. Shameful. Pick up 4 or 5 kids playing on the streets, pair them with Warner. That team will do way better than these 'international' players.",-9
That one siraj over + another sundar/moeen/dube over will decide the game. I'm hoping saini will do his part in the death.,1
"Mohammad Siraj in Powerplay (IPL)-

Get Williamson this ball,1
We are reaching levels of jinxing and reverse jinxing never reached before!,15
Chut umpiring,8
RRR is close to 10. What are they waiting for lol,1
These blind fucks are gonna cost us the game,4

And utter ""SRH"" just one time plz?",4
Umpires really want RCB to win tonight,9
"I like how Warner is always smiling, even at stands lol",13
Holder should look for the three overs of pace,1
Trump is right folks : it's rigged,0
Warner knows something we don’t. Or he’s just gone insane and is just laughing,35
Another BIG DICK SIX by love machine ❤️ big daddy Williamson✊💦,25
Warner probably smiling just to put off RCB to thinking they have a master plan.,7
F for RCB,3
Sexyyy sixyy,1
What a shot from Kane omg we’re back in this,13
Runs scored by Saini and Siraj are more valuable than Finch's runs today.,7
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS IDOLO 😭,7

Next two overs have to be pretty fucking tight for RCB to have a chance,9
It’s hilarious to compare SRH fans’ comments about Kane Williamson before and after he hits a 6!,14
Being an RCB fan is one of the most toxic relationships you can be in,10
pls SRH screw it up,2
I have a 4 hour job interview in 2 hours and I'm fucking shitting bricks. And I want srh to win. Please please.,5
Saini Sundar Saini Siraj,3
I’m satisfied that at least we fought back hard.,9
RCB arev fucked. They dont have a Bumrah or Archer at the death.,4
Ee ka hoi gawa ...i went when they were 1 down,2
"So, then Kane taking this match away.",6
Retain this man at any cost even if we lose,1
"Good season tho

I'll take this",4
Kohli post match be like we were 20 runs short,3
RCB 🤡🤡🤡🤡,2
"Gonna loose it if Kane gets out in the first over after time out.
And sunny will be like ""how many times have we seen a wicket after time out""",8
Zen mode Kanos thrives in such situations. He will get SRH over the line.,8
Hedging my bet on a finish by 18.4,4
This over decides the match,8
"bhenchod 2 international captains at the crease, a tight equation and you gotta take your bullshit ad-stuffed ceat timeout",7
Were there any fours after Manish Pandey?,1
"After that six, not sure whether Ali/Sundar should get an over, Holder will take them on for sure. Maybe go with pacers for 3 overs and Hope Dube at 20th does a Shankar like that Australian game or that Bangladesh game.",2
Williamson paces chases well.,3
Kohli berating chahal. Smh,5
well played SRH and Kane. The way u finished the game without getting out was surreal.,3
Good fight rcb,2
That 6 completely ruined it. And coulve been avoided too. But Kanos man he is something,3
why did I touch myself this morning knowing I'd get to see Kanos bat later??,7
"Atleast we fought, really didn't expect it",2
Time for kanos to snap,3
"Williamson is just something else. When the mega auction comes, teams will bid for around 20 crores lol",5
Oh Dube...interesting...,3
"Zampa bowled better than chahal and rashid. In what wo... Oh sorry its 2020, i forgot",5
Dube to bowl? Why,2
Dube... holder is already licking his lips.,1
Dube lol. Gg,1
And.....it's dube ffs,2
Oh fuck Dube is bowling!!!!!!!!!,3
"Turbonerds, come in here give me some hope",2
"5 mins earlier : Williamson, you fucking donkey!
Now: oh dear, oh dear gorgeous.",7
LORD DUBE?!!,3
"Honestly, well done to Rcb. In spite of having a big disadvantage losing the toss and the dew coming in, they managed to give them a scare.",3
Swann making JFK conspiracy references is why you have to watch the Dugout!,6
"Koach, still telling Chahal about that bad last ball. 

And what a bad ball it was. 

A wicket would have been made it almost winning for  RCB.",2
"I really hope Kane finishes this game. He has a knack of changing gears and getting out without actually finishing the match. If we lose this, will put a serious dent on his IPL legacy.",2
Dube lol,3
Dube?!,3
Dube? Adios,2
"Thank you guys it's been a ride, see you again",5
This is the over,3
Dubey???? Did Koach forgot 32 runs over?,3
GAME OVER THIS OVER,1
Match over boys,1
Lord Dube is here. Best decision,2
Bairstow would’ve fell against spin so fast,2
Attack this over or play it normally?,1
So Dube has his final chance to redeem his woeful day.,2
WTF Dube??We are fucked!!,4
Oh Fuck this is either stupid or genius,5
Wait why is dube bowling,3
Lord Dube is here!,2
Oh god why Dube!,2
Dube 0.0,1
"Dube's here.

All the best SRH. Hope you win against DC.",6
Lord Dube has arrived. Pls get Williamson or just bowl a good over PLS,2
DUBE IS FROM DINDA ACADEMY,2
"Seeing Holder and Chahal stand next to each other, it’s amazing as you wonder how they’re both the same species 

And despite their difference in size, both are equally good at this game",2
Dubey? That's GG,2
Big brain VK right there,3
"You know what... Fuck 2020.

RCB has been depressed for longer. I would love for SRH to win but I'm not against a depressed fanbase geting some happiness. Let the best team win.",2
"Pack up bois,  it's over",4
scotty dissing bairstow is next level,2
"Dube ? Yeah, This is the swing over, We either lose everything or win everything",2
You did it you crazy son of a bitch koach,3
This will be a big or bad over bc dube is bowling,3
"Dube , why",2
"make or break over, they are getting a part timer... can click either ways",3
GAME OVERR LADS,1
Dube? Wtf? Big over alert for me please.,8
Adios r/cricket,3
Dube ? Oh boy,1
Doob gaye ab.,2
Giving a crunch over to dube...,2
Well well rcb demanding another re ~~count~~innings right now,1
Why dube man,2
Oh no,1
BIG OVER ALERT,3
Wht .... Why dube,1
Dube why?,1
Dube? Kyu be?,2
Bowling Dube? Looks like Kohli is trying to follow the same script as our first game when Dube helped them win.,3
"Maa ki chut

Why are you giving the ball to fucjing dube off all the people",2
Excellent 1st ball,3
Rcb's game to lose,2
Dube lmao this is ending in this over,3
Don't judge an over until the sixth ball,3
"Dube to bowl. Game over for RCB.
Please DC, beat SRH now",3
Blunder over incoming!,5
Just grateful 130 game got this interesting. There hasn't been enough of low scoring action this year,3
Why the fuck is Dube bowling!?!?,2
Kohli ran out of spinners so he brought on a fast spinner,5
Dube better take a hatric now,2
"Common boys we still got this, common boys common.",2
Dube ?!? really? I have a bad feeling about this,2
This is madness. Always trying to be too clever.,2
Virat's Joginder moment is here,3
"Kohli retard confirmed or genius confirmed?

Find out after this over.",3
If we count all the LEGAL BALLS. RCB already won the match.,3
"Oh no, it's Dube. 

Really surprised by the move.",3
"This is a typical Koach big brain move, with 10% chance of working out and 90% chance of losing the game",5
Dube? Now? This is bold af.,5
Never go full Kohli,6
"Why aren’t they looking for 4s

It’s been a six or a single",3
I can see the reasoning behind bowling Dube. Kanos has a history of soft dismissals against Medium pacers.,7
Inb4 Dube gets Kane,7
"Bowl yourself Kohli, you coward",9
If only AB batted for a couple more overs!! Damn you Nattu!,8
Why aren’t there any 4s? It’s been a single or a six,5
b.tech Hardik.,9
"Either this goes Kohli's way and no one says anything, or it goes the shit way and everybody fucks him left right and center",2
"Moeen was bowling tight lines, why take a risk now",2
Why the fuck is Dube bowling rn when you have two spinners and two frontline pacers,1
Dube has the power of Joginder Sharma in him. He git this,3
"WTF ? Giving Dube over here is suicide  

Moeen Ali is better",5
Dugout advertising alcohol on Indian broadcasting incoming ban,1
"good, finish this quickly srh",1
Why not continue with spin,1
Yes virat dube is a better bowler than washy yes,2
"Dube!!!! 

Kohli = behenchod of the year",2
Hahahaha dubey? Chalo qualifier 2 ko wannakam.,2
Big brain time bringing in Dube here,2
Dube has to get a wicket,2
Kohli throwing a hail Mary,1
Dube RCB ke chances Dubey,2
They can't even stop the singles.,2
Dube over wins it for SRH,2
"Kohli's u19 wc team knocked out Williamson captained new Zealand out of the world cup in the semi final.

Can willamson level the score here.",0
Lmfaooooo Kohli would rather bowl Dube than Shitoeen Ali,0
Saini to bowl 18 and 20. Hopefully he turns it up like against MI earlier in the eeason,3
They're playing for 3-4 singles and one boundary per over,1
Really missing Morris today eh?,1
[deleted],7
"Dube is a huge gamble. High risk, high gain reward",3
Maaaaaaaan one of these teams has to beat peak MI,2
I swear if Dube gets smashed here.....,11
Dube gonna turn this match around. One way or the other. :D,13
Inb4 Dube is bowling crunch overs in the t20 wc for India and getting tonked. Koach can actually do this.,5
Brain dead lmao,6
4 balls to go,1
This Kohli guy is good. Is he selected for the upcoming Australia series?   /s,3
Kohli makes so many fuckall decisions and yet gets confused how they lost,2
Yeah. This is big brain time,3
I heard a nick there,1
Srh has 3 captains and that doesn’t even include the team captain lol,9
We expecting 3 overs of pace after this?,4
"Boring question again, no, fitness isn't needed at all",2
Rashid and Samad can also hit,3
If Dube gets kane out he will redeem himself,3
This over has to be the one SRH score a good 12-14.,4
Y'all neutrals need to stop jinxing either of the teams by mistake. I can accept reverse jinxes but not the unintentional jinxes.,6
Dube is half decent tbf to him.,3
3 to go,2
Koach thinks Dube will be his Joginder Sharma.,10
Kohli is just winging it at this point lol,1
Holder has to go after him now,1
Holy. These two are calm as fuck.,3
Koach The Gambler,7
4D chess by Koach,5
Kohli is a fuckin gambler,5
ok im gonna be laughing my ass off if they dont get at least 2 boundaries this over,2
Why is dubey bowling now,1
Dube ucan do it!!!,2
[deleted],-5
Atleast he's bowling slow,1
Should dube bowl instead of siraj?,1
"Go on dube, two more balls",1
They talk anything on Dugout lol,7
I love Kane but we need this,5
Dube kind of not leaking here hmmmm,1
Holder is now going to hang back and smash the slower one,1
If those siraj runs are what costs us I stg 😡,3
2 to go,1
Good guy kohli giving dube the over for max meme potential,0
Dube haters getting it back in record time,1
"Koach the f\*\* gambler betting his yacht on Dube

edit: yacht is secured",2
Utter galaxy brain move from Koach handing the over to Dennis Lillee reincarnate Shivam Dube.,1
"Absolute peach of an over so far, ngl..",3
Wicket in this over. Called it first,2
Dube I love you,3
"RCB : Scores mere 131

RCB now : Anyways",4
"Cmon boys, we just need 5 sixes. Where's Tewatia when you need him.",1
SMH looks like SRH fans eased up on the reverse jinxing after the 1st innings. Never let your guard down lads,5
Trick is pace off the ball,4
Can dube do hardik,1
Now is not the time for the Altroz,7
Williamson is pure class.,9
fuck me daddyy KANEEE,2
The fuck is holder doing,3
Dube kyu be,3
Siraj over is the key tbh,2
Jinxed it too early,3
"Dube has bowled extremely well till here, gotta praise Kohli here this could have been a make or break over. Took some serious balls",5
😭😭😭😭😭😭,3
Cmon 2 more,1
Fuck it.,1
SRH please you have enough trophies,7
Kanos will try to slog now. Hopefully he connects.,4
Kane is tailormade for this situation,5
Williamson is killing us softly,4
Fuck you kane,2
"So English bois we’re all rooting for RCB to see the look on Davey Warner’s little face, right?

Ok good",10
Adarchod,2
Shot,4
Get him out REEEEEEEE,1
Dube looking like 2017 yuvraj deciding to take up bowling,1
Lord Dube sinkinG RCB's ship.,1

Rcb's game to lose,0
Jesus dugout just loses it when they show Altroz,9
Kane >> Bradman,7
Is the dew playing up? Balls seems to be skimming off the bat.,6
We need Kane to see us through,5
Family already calling S U P E R O V E R,15
Class is permanent  (add ALL CAPS),8
"Alright come on now, how the fuck can you not hit Dubey ........... cannot be so goddamn passive this late.",9
"Pressure chase. Almost 10 an over needed. What do you turn to as a batsman? 

Obviously the most classical cover drive ever.",6
"7 off the over, not bad",9
"Honestly I thought Williamson miscalculated, but he knows what to do",4
"Just 7 runs, not bad",8
Fuck 7 off that over is an absolute fucking steal,16
Continue with the reverse jinxing lads. It's working,2
Would've wanted a bit more than 7 out of Dube I feel,8
Good over actually by Dube ji.,1
"Lol you can take CSK out of the IPL

But you can't take Dhoni's TM Tuk-TuK out of it /s",5
Who shall choke more now let's see,5
"*Fuck it, bowl slow*",5
Somebody jinx kane,4
Man this is getting tense,8
7 runs from a Dube death over is really good,11
Fine over tbh,7
7 runs is not bad. Fuck ya'll Dube haters.,10
7 ain't bad tbh,2
Dube did well. Two Saini and one Siraj.,5
"7 runs off a Dube over, I take that as a W",4
"Glad to be proved wrong by both Koach and Dube. Now win it!!

>[Moeen Ali is better](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jp3yo7/match_thread_eliminator_royal_challengers/gbd49di/?context=3)",5
Kane is doing it all for the Altroz.,2
Not bad Dube,5
10 k comments for srh match.. Never expected,3
That could’ve been way worse,7
decent over guys.,6
That was a good over from Dubey,5
Super over is the best we can do now,2
Okay fast bowler time,2
MPL is way worse than a Nigerian prince,3
Not as bad as I expected,7
C'mon give us a super over ya losers,7
Not bad not bad,2
this is the over. they've got to get 15+.to get back in control,4
Good over by Dube,4
That's not too bad. Those dots helped. 28 off 18. Saini has to win this for RCB now,7
Why this dibbly dobbly filth now,1
Dugout lmao,2
141 from Dube? Speed gun is surely messed up.,6
"only 7 runs off Dube, this is unreal",5
"This is going to the wire, isn't it ?",3
This is why you need someone like Kane in the middle order. What a player,2
Dugout MEME REVIEW lmao,4
"This Dube over was a missed opportunity, Jason should've attacked Dube imo",2
Again commentators are simping for Altroz. Stop it!,1
Holder bc just smash two out of the park,2
RCB can still win if we do the 7/17.,4
Decent over tbh.,2
Dube gives 7....sad that Saini is going to have a 16 run over soon.,2
Williamson the surgeon and Holder the butcher. Who'll win the game for us?,3
Watch Saini leak runs,2
"All things considered, not a bad over from Dube.",3
Dude doesn't even look like he is trying,2
Fuck it. Superover.,6
Can totally imagine saini giving runs bcoz of speed,2
Tbf good over by dubeji,5
Depending on Siraj at the death. Hmm.....,3
Oh no,1
Saini is gonna destroy us,1
"After so many years you would think a guy will pick up few things on the job; but nop, not Captain Kohli. Still making same old insane decisions",2
"28 off 3 with these two on the crease, SRH match to lose",3
I am unable to eat with this tension,3
Now they're showing influencers during cricket?,3
"Kohli would have taken anything less than 12 runs off Dubey.

Only 7? Fucking solid.

Kane is tuk-tuking too much.",2
That field placement for last ball was excellent. Good captaincy but target is easy for Kanos.,4
"Both Saini and Siraj scare me

I trust any spinner or dubey over them",8
Fuck Siraj needs to bowl one death over right,1
Siraj to put that KKR spell to end this all at once,5
Swann shop flirting you're married,1
This will be a humdinger.,1
Kane giving rcb the plane back to india,3
Kane is gonna finish it in the next over itself by smashing the bowler all over the fkin ground,1
"Speed gun read 141 kph for Dube looool

How broken is that thing",4
Please Saini and Siraj keep it tight and bring it home,4
"I don't think bowling 2 overs of Saini is a good option, as Holder can play pace well, so sneak in at least one Moeen Ali over.Also not saying this so that I get more fantasy points.",3
"If we're gonna lose to anyone from SRH I'd take Kane tbh, total king",5
Interested to know if Dube bowling was from Kohli or Hesson-Katich,2
Khooni Kohli vs Wholesome Williamson,2
Swann bb you're married what u doin,3
Big brain from srh. Now koach will give one more over to dubey,7
"Bruh around 58 matches in and Aakash Chopra is still doing his stupid player name elongating thing, kaaaaaane Williamson. Bhag BC :|",5
Come on holder stonking time,2
Maad respect for dube +++++,4
Decent over that.,3
"Siraj will be bowling the 19th most likely

Advantage SRH",1
THIS OVER NEEDS TO GO FOR LESS THAN 6,2
Saini do what you did against Mumbai the first time,4
Dube bowled a 141.1 kph :O,1
28 of 18 cmon rcb,1
now its upto Siraj and Saini to finish the game....for SRH.,2
"Never expected Siraj to be the frontline bowler for RCB, before Saini

Damn 2020",2
Saini needs to do a Bumrah,3
Decisive over,2
Saini needs to vary his pace here...,2
"Big brain time:

You can’t lose 7/17 if you are already 4 down.",6
29 off 3. I'm scared because this is my team we're talking about. 15 off 3 even a big ask for them. One wicket and we're knocked out of this match.,6
i'm just glad we gave a tougher fight than dc,4
"2 sixes will do now, please pleaseeee",1
Meanwhile scriptwriters: 🌚🌚🌚🌚,8
Trust srh to bottle up a straight forward chase,6
Saini do what you did against Mumbai the first time,4
I just love low scoring thrillers compared to high scoring ones.,8
"Gotta love Warner's decisions

RCB were destroying teams and chasing anything thrown to them in 2016

Warner chose to bat first in the final vs RCB , 2016",6
"Whatever happens from here as a neutral this has been a incredible fightback from RCB, very well done",10
Now holder needs to release some pressure of kanos,7
Saini looks like the kid who never turns in his Math homework,8
PLEASE RCB ONE LAST MIRACLE PLEASE SRH SCREW UP PLEASE,5
"Oh boy, good luck guys!",3
Williamson ka wicket chaiye abhi,4
"Mark my words, Saini is gonna get tonked",2
Saini do what you did against Mumbai the first time,3
"If Siraj will have a moment of truth for all that attitude, this is it",3
"The way RCB batted, I didn't think this would be a close match but here we are..",2
Saini pls,4
Can we just stop counting please :((,0
[deleted],3
Williamson chillness is giving me panic attack,1
That last over from Natty which went for 13 runs is proving crucial for RCB chances .,3
Saini is bowling with an injured hand. It’ll be difficult to bowl well.,2
Siraj next over game over,2
Kane getting bowled this over,0
Man just hope Saini doesn't bowl full tosses or above waist no balls,2
This match had no business being so thrilling,2
whats 7/17?,2
[deleted],-2
When you realize Siraj still has one over 😎,1
Thnk godddd,1
More like Jiopay fair play award,1
Those runs saved are still priceless,3
Spray and inshallahnow RCB fans. Inshallah,1
Fuck😭😭😭😭😭,2
Holder will give hope to RCB only to muscle out 2 sixes,6
Good to see all the 'fuck Dube' and 'braindead Koach' comments eat their words,8
Gote in my mouth😭🍒,5
Great save given the context.,8
Catch? Match?,1
We were this close to greatness,3
Oh fuckkkkk DDP man so fucking close,3
Dropped the match!!,-1
Styris and Swanny still roasting the third umpire,1
Are they playing Money for Nothing by Dire Straits? Top Class.,1
Was it drop or saving runs there,1
"Saved 5, just couldn't complete the catch unfortunately",3
"Ooooh so close! Great save nonetheless.  


This could be decisive either way!",2
Yeah I'm done. Can boys,2
Lmao,1
DAMN an almost FAF moment,3
That ddp catch is gonna hunt us,2
Saini has my respect for bowling with an hand.,4
Should have caught it tbh. Pressure catch tho.,7
Holy shit,9
"Thanks for the drop, padikkal.",0
Swann is just being paid for shitposting at this point.,7
rcb luck,3
Excellent Save,7
Awww,2
That was some effort,7
[deleted],5
"WTF no ball,  catch or six",1
Shit oyyy,3
Good save,5
Well tried Padikkal. Brilliant effort,8
 Saved 5 runs. Can’t expect a miracle catch every time,10
Tej Gaand una. Hindi commentary lol,1
Great effort,3
That could be the match.,2
Great try man.,8
Hey last match Chahal was there. They learnt!!,12
"Fucking hell, atleast it did not go for 6",15
Swann talking of Sangakarra's luscious hair is perfecr remedy to the stress that is building now.,8
Great save,8
Just saved 5 runs that's critical,12
Fuckkkk,2
GG Padikkal. Saved 5 there.,19
Good effort DDP saved 5,15
Ugh atleast it’s not a wicket,7
Oh chahal you butter,1
Saini pace off you idiot,1
"Lmao
5 runs saved, more like dropped match",0
Padikkal is a fucking gem,9
Shit runnings,1
Faf would've caught that,4
We're running like grandpas,2
"Two bad balls here yet only 2 runs, RCB chancing their luck.",2
No boundary in this over,1
That has to be 2. Come on.,3
Can't blame him tbh. Just because ridiculous catches like that are more common now doesn't mean they aren't tough as fuck.,10
Trash running,3
Holder so huge he cover drove a short ball bc!,4
That 5 runs can win the match for rcb,4
"Great save, he only reached that due to his height",4
Brilliant fielding by DDP. Fuck all running by SRH. Just 1 there is a sin.,5
That's some effort from.Padikkal,3
How r u all feeling right now.? Asking both srh and rcb fans.,4
How is Kohli upset about that,7
Are they playing calculated cricket or are they not able to hit big,2
Chahal recoiled back from the force of his own throw,21
GG paddikal.,3
"Lol, two singles, could have been two double",1
I think there were two runs on both those deliveries wth,1
Wtf is this running between the wickets,3
4 ft 8 lmao,2
Faf would have.,5
"Saini is the least trustable bowler imo

Idk how he did it against mi",7
aww kane too classy for RCB,2
So many misfields ffs,3
[deleted],2
Kohli should applaud that effort instead of going 🤷🤷,10
Swanny and Styris on fire,2
You either die a mi or live long enough to see yourself become a csk,4
devdutt undid his season there,0
Class,1
Ah fck GG Kanos,3
Time for another Williamson simp round,4
GET WILLIAMSON OUTT,3
20+ off 2 and it could go anyway,2
"Tbh that's a very tough chance, he's saved the runs and that ball deserved to go for 6 - absolute filth",4
Running is terrible. That full toss should have been a 6.,5
Koach has to stop getting disappointed for catches I’ve never seen him take,19
Lmao Saini can't believe it,4
Why there is no 2,1
NOOOOOOOOO,2
hmmm batsmen are struggling with the slowness of the pitch. PACE ON BABYYYYYYYYY,7
Chahal should be sent out for last 2 overs. Bring Negi in.,1
williamson flexing his experience,13
Yes.,4
kane’s like “lemme just hit that for a four real quick”,10
Losing a thriller in a knock out? The pain 😭😭😭😭,9
William what a stud! What a boss! What a playaa!,11
Saini looks like a Narcos character,6
Williamson is just ridiculously good!,6
Kanos you beauty,8
Is Holder usually that slow running between the wickets?,1
Class,1
"Saini is so shit and people consider him as good as bumrah, shami",0
What is kohli animated about? That wss a crazy save.,15
"No third man, amazing  kohli.",2
Oh my I love cricket,1
Koach tf are you thinking man,7
Class,5
Williamson is a bit too much.,4
"Its not about how many runs are left, its about who melts first",0
Shit oyyyy,2
Yo third man for fucking Kanos man wtf,1
Kane unreal. Doing it like SA WC 2019 match,5
Sheer c lass,3
Chahal and midfields. Can you name a more iconic duo?,3
Beauty!,3
Kohli ungrateful bastard. That was a good stop appreciate it,7
next over siraj is the end,3
Classic 4,2
That is so NZ v SA 2019 WC shot. I see that 4 followed by the six to mid wicket in my dreams,5
Dont do that...dont give me hope,4
Cheeky from kanos,1
Kane the Man!,5
World class,5
Gg,1
Williamson signature shot. Plays it so late it's behind him.,9
Kanos masterclass.,6
"Pressure chase. 10 an over needed. What do you turn to as a batsman?

Obviously the most classical dab to third man.",8
Match still in the balance. A wicket here could do it for RCB,5
"Alright boys, 20 runs short speech incoming",11
its over,5
That’s why Williamson is top 3 batsmen in world cricket,18
What a classy shot,11
20+ runs needed in 2 overs with 2 set batsmen. You would take those odds as a batting side.,19
That is class,4
CLASS,3
Kanos is love. Kanos is life.,12
I cannot even abuse Kanos,11
Kane showing Koach how it’s done,6
""" Fuck it. Bowl Fast. """,10
"Williamson QTπ😘😘😘

FULL HOMO",9
"ball in Chahal's hand, Chahal throws with all his might, ball remains on the field, Chahal goes to wicketkeeper",11
21 from 14 is tough,3
I orgasmed,3
holder is lanky af and slow,4
"Saini is supposed to be a wicket taker, cmon man wtf",3
Kohli pissed at padikkal is the reason why newcomers don't perform well under him,27
Close one eh lads and lasses,9
"Oh goddd kanos, I think I just orgasmed",10
"Told ya, that was the ray of hope RCB gives fans every match before the KO punch.",13
Kane Williamson  : I am ABD now,18
Stop it right now and declare Kanos to be President of US,41
"Good save from padikkal but that shud have been caught at this level

Might very well have dropped the match as well",2
Its gonna be a smooth chase.,5
Saini has LITERALLY no variations,11
Atleast we weren't humiliated,17
Absolute clutch play from KW.,6
Virat there not even applauding Paddikal for 5 saved runs is why he is a terrible captain.,41
Saini is like bowling machine.. no variations,10
Saini has 0 variations,17
Williamson is my man of the match already. Soaked in all the pressure single-handedly. Terrific batting.,16
Scenes when Siraj comes in and takes out Kane next over,9
Need some of that MiyanMagic now,11
Kane's late cut is a block. How he gets it so fine? Superb wrists.,12
"Need Kane out, not winning this otherwise",8
This is some god tier innings from Williamson considering the fact that it’s a playoff match and the rest of the batsman shit their pants,13
watching Williamson bat is so satisfying man.,5
Can't believe Sunny didn't hype that 4 from Kanos. It was brilliant,3
20 runs short,2
Williamson making Dhoni proud.,-2
Siraj will finish this,3
I think I'm going to have a panic attack...please please dont take this to the last over,6
Siraj's going to have to bowl the over of his life to keep RCB in this,15
Saini is fucking shit,2
Slow ball please,1
How amazing was that shot from Williamson. Wow,4
Should Moeen have bowled one more in the middle,5
"Holy shit, the calmness to actually hit that bowl at third man in that pressure. Absolute class",17
It’s fine we are just testing our middle order this game guys,22
With this performance SRH won't stand anywhere near MI.,5
Williamson looks in absolute control here...,6
Saini is bowling absolute dogshit,7
Saini ffs pace off,5
"Whatever the outcome of this match be, rcb fought well",13
Really... RCB should have batted better given the might in that order.,5
Is Kanos the real chase master?,3
Watch siraj win match in an over,5
The Lord shall decide the game now,3
THIS IS GIVING ME SO MUCH ANXIETY,4
Williamson >> Biden >> Trump.,15
Fuck so now Siraj at the death?,5
So it comes down to Lord Siraj bowling a magical over.,4
"Honestly as a neutral 

This game has been rather a great one given how easy it seemed after the first inning.",8
This needs to be a 6 runs max over to make a match of it.,3
As long as God Kane is playing.. Rcb is losing this game...,3
"Out of any great/legendary batsman in the last decade, I would always want Williamson to bat in any critical situation",4
Srh has good captaincy candidates in case Warner misses a game,3
Please don’t take it Dhoni deep and do a Gambhir.,1
"RCB fans :- thank god that wasnt a 6 but would be better if it was caught

SRH fans :- thank god it wasn't caught but would be better if it was six tho",5
This is the most Williamson innings ever ❤️,2
Still tight for srh,3
Still think we'll lose,3
Saint can't bowl the Yorker? Wtf was that Over.,3
"Williamson absolutely brilliant, can't say enough how well he is doing this.",2
They are missing Morris aren't they,3
Will be happy if we lose in super over.,3
Williamson on the right track to join CSK as he is taking the game deep and deeper,9
Bowl Moeen.,3
Dorime 👐,3
"Kanos is gonna fuck Siraj in the ass, rip",2
Miya ready ho jao!,7
Dube >>>,2
Last over bois,2
Honestly we are probably better off bowling Dube this over than Siraj.,3
All hopes for RCB lying on Siraj is peak RCB,8
So lord is next,2
"19th decides the Destiny, oh god, please....",4
Dhoni should be loving the chase,6
Fuck Siraj is the one who can win this game for RCB,3
"Siraj, now would be a good time to do that double wicket maiden trick again....just in case.",10
What's zampa saying,1
LORD SIRAJ in a death over!,3
"Siraj?

Congrats SRH you're the better team",8
Leadership group = Playing Eleven,2
Pls take it to the last over,5
18 off 2 is as easy as candy from kids.,2
THIS OVER IS MAKE OR BREAK,1
Come on Holder tonk one for 90m,4
VKs reaction to that 5 run save summarises RCBs IPL 2020,9
KANOSSS,1
Can lord siraj save the day for rcb?,3
Siraj has to activate his Test Match mode now,8
Still rcb's game to lose unless kanos decides to hit 2 sixes or smthg,3
KW is teasing Kohli and RCB fans there by giving them some hope. only to kill it in the 20th over with a six.,6
"Siraj, pull a bumrah mate",4
"Siraj is only good with new ball, now is gonna Bowl 2 wides and give all the runs in this one only and Holder gonna hit him for 2 sixes fuck sake",6
Siraj's chance to become a RCB legend,1
What tips would Zampa be giving you Siraj lol,6
This is the swing over. Can go either way,2
Inb4 edge goes for 4.,3
Pls Siraj destroy your home team,5
"Cmon lord, get kanos out",0
I will make a siraj shrine if he pulls it of this over,5
[deleted],5
We should've finished the match by now. The pessimist in me is screaming that Kanos will get out this over and we'll have a collapse to lose the match. Hoping for the best here.,7
Every match is going down the wire .. wanted to see some convincing wins atleast,0
Anything over 10 in last over RCBs game to lose then,3
This tournament is MI's to lose IMO. No one looks even remotely close to them skill wise.,4
[deleted],2
Can it be a super over ⚡,6
Kanos to win this with a helicopter in the last ball and remove his mask to reveal a time traveling Dhoni from 2014.,11
How much must RCB hate SRH at this point. Always stomping on their dreams xD,7
Kane is my god..,3
Still RCB's game to lose,1
"Williamson is the most versatile batsman I've ever seen (at par with Hussey). Can play as an opener, bat in the middle order and is a finisher as well. Most batsmen can only do two of these.",1
Inb4 Siraj bowls a bouncer and it goes for a boundary,3
*Watch Siraj take 6 wicket in the over fools*,3
The deciding over,2
Saint won't play for India if he bowls like that. No Yorkers or bouncers. Doesn't even bowl length.,2
"It'll be a shame if SRH somehow lose this with 6 wickets left, they gotta close in",3
Guy from Hyderabad will stop SRH i think,2
Siraj can't go for more than 5-6. Which is asking a lot.,3
RCB PLEASE ONE MORE MIRACLE PLEASE SRH PLEASE SCREW IT UP PLEASE,3
"1 Six, 1 Four, some TukTuk^(TM)  runs and we are Home. Let's gooooooo",1
"Siraj got those extra runs in the end. Siraj giveth.

Will Siraj taketh?",6
Williamson in yellow would be really pleasant to watch.,2
Kanos please,2
oh LORD!,2
"Asking all the cricket experts.


What could've possibly been the reason behind Kohli not continuing with Sundar/Moeen in the 17th / 18th over?",1
No matter what happens from here.. Well bowled rcb after that shit 1st innings,7
Only a miracle can save RCB from here.,2
Siraj at death is no good,3
Siraj can either win for RCB or SRH. No inbetween,3
They are playing Mia bhai song wtffff,1
"Either Siraj becomes a hero or the match is over in the next few minutes.

Can't imagine a middle ground scenario.",6
"Good thinking from management to send Holder up ahead of Samad. 

Holder's experience and his calmness was needed there rather than putting pressure on youngster who might panic given the big occasion.",6
I WILL PUT SIRAJ PHOTO IN MY TEMPLE IF HE DOES WELL HERE,13
Ok boys siraj has the reedeeming over now,3
The economy is so fucked up even jcb have to advertise.,2
Lord Siraj or Meme Siraj over coming up,2
Es saala cup naamde?,1
"Thriller of a match but your team loses.

Or

Your team comfortably walks over the other.",3
Imagine losing 132 target game because required run rate was too high in the end.,6
Williamson should pull of a New Zealand from here and choke this..,6
"Siraj is a good new ball bowler, but we all know he leaks runs in the death.",3
"With RCB's shit death bowling, this will be easy af.",6
"Siraj redemption arc incoming, He's gonna bring it home",6
"Alternate scene of Batman Begins 

Siraj: ""You still haven't given up on me?""

Kohli: ""Never""",3
Fuck it I said it in terms of class Kane>Virat,3
Y'all got any more of that miyamagic?,6
Long levers to hole out at deep mid wicket,3
"Easy win for SRH

These 2 ooze maturity and class.",5
If Sioraj can bowl somewhat well and give Saini at least 10 to defend onkly then do RCb have a chance here. A wicket is required,4
Holder should slog one six,2
Holder has to deposit this ball,3
Let’s give Saini atleast 8 to defend,3
11.3 k 😅,6
"17 off 2 overs at death so far, if they repeat that 17, we got a Super over again.",3
Fuck me can't handle this,7
Time stood still,3
Bc andha umpire.,8
Tight finish,2
Why is this even referred?😂😂,10
Umpire why u standing there men if you are gonna review these?,8
Apna apna goti muh me lene ka time aa gya,4
"Speaking of signature shots, I can still picture Kohli’s short arm jab for six through wide mid-off off Woakes

Even though it was nearly 4 years ago",5
Lol Siraj is shit. No clue why you guys giving him so much hype.,-5
BC JCB wale bhi advertisement karne lage😭,4
This match will go to the last over so SRH strategy is pretty fucked up already.,4
"Siraj has done very well before this over, if it happens dont start abusing him, those wickets he got out made it possible to get it this close",6
Sunny G livid,2
"And ""umpires call"" is considered of these fucking assholes",1
Harsh,2
Unlucky siraj there,1
All hail the Lord.,1
F,1
Come on 17 off 5 easy with lord,2
Noooooooooo,1
Lmao third umpire is trolling is,6
Ahh the Italian cut.,3
Both his feet are in the crease and they are checking it lol,4
Thats it,2
And that's one of the nails done,5
Hehe lucky,3
He ain't death bowler,4
Congrats SRH,9
Very jammy. Don’t care,3
Fucking unlucky.,4
Too nervous,5
Why is third man fking inside,7
GG,5
Kane Williamson: Can’t love this man enough. Not even mad that RCB lost.,6
Ffs can some luck go Rcb’s way for once,4
"Yep, That 4",5
Bowl slow or bowl yorkers,6
"Damn
Is this the most popular thread for this season?",11
Thank you Sunny G,3
Miss Morris here,3
That’s the game. We’ll be facing this SRH in Q2 and I’m not ready at all for it.,1
Match over,2
MSD has shown some signs of losing his cool but kane is like super cool,7
How unlucky are they!! Lol,2
"Almost there, guys.",3
SIRAJ IS NOT A DEATH BOWLER FFS,4
Bhenchod,1
:(,2
I was peeing when he hit the boundary...brb chugging water,4
He should bowl Yorkers,2
Shit field from shit captain,3
Why wouldn't you have a third man,4
"field placement, no third man.",1
Not a bad fight tho,2
amazing placement /s,2
YORK HIM!,2
"Thats why AB shud be fielding

Had Ab been in place of DDP

Can remember a similar magical catch against SRH last season to win us the game",2
Holder takes 3 strides and he's down the other end.,4
Fucking hell why are they not running the 2s man,1
Can't believe why no one believes in having a proper third man these days,2
"Friendship end with RCB, MI is my friend now",2
Koach put third man back ffs,2
Game. Set. Match. See you in Final SRH!!!,1
Kohli ahahahahahahahah,1
Siraj helping SRH move things along,3
F in the chat,1
Not one bowler who can bowl Yorker. Shit,3
[deleted],7
These 3 balls r extremely crucial,4
Still in this boys. Don't give up now,4
Need to finish this in this over itself. Saini can defend 10,3
Finally we are out.,2
Shit captaincy by Kohli where's the fucking third man,3
Congrats SRH,1
Memes are well and fine but how long does the rcb management think will fans keep supporting them,7
"Holder

*He tall*",7
Can Siraj bowl a Yorker at 140?,2
Slower balls aren't needed man,1
FFS .. How many fours need to go there for Kohli to move third man back?,7
Sorry RCB but Siraj isn't Bumrah.,10
Hmmmmmmm,1
Just bad bad running,2
Meme team vs choking team,8
Vintage Siraj ( ◜‿◝ ),6
Holder does not do quick 2s,3
"In b4, we were 15-20 runs short.",7
King Kane.,2
Serene as the sea. That's what one feels when Kanos is at the helm of chasing.,5
I LEGIT BITING MY ARMS,5
That was ridiculous shot from Williamson.,5
A different team would’ve defended this when SRH was 80-4,10
really want an RCB victory here,5
Excellent Fielding by Kohli. Saved 1,11
William-san UwU,10
FFS suraj bowl slow,6
Saini has to nail 6 yorkers to win this,5
I can't believe how good Williamson is,3
I don’t care about dew. If we win this we have to bat first if we win the toss in coming games.,2
This is why MI made sure SRH qualifies.,3
Ooh nearly 50 for Williamson,2
Big brain move to have fine leg and third leg up,4
That was a 3,6
masterclass on how to bat from Williamson to kohli in matches that actually matter,8
What bad running this. Had at least 5 extra runs in the last 4 overs.,9
Good shot imagine if that was a boundary,7
Take wickets!!,2
Good game guys,3
Kohli field placement at this point in the game is kinda shit,3
Poor running.,1
See ya on the 27th lads,3
I thought it would go all the way.,3
super over anyone?,4
Williamson is calm as hell.,5
Low score thrillers man!,5
"Damn, Bishop did ask Holder, how his batting has been coming along. 

Sus IPL for sure /s",4
RCB fans : *FEELS BAD MAN*,6
Don't get the hate for Siraj when the batsmen failed so hard....,11
"No Third man, no fine leg ?",6
Only why win is if SRH chocks somehow lmao,8
RCB gave me more mental trauma than my childhood,13
I feel I have seen this match a lot of times. It ends with Williamson six in the last over.,8
This running gonna bite us in the ass,8
Shaaa fielding setup..get that third man..,1
"Game over, rcb gave us a good game tho",3
If only Kohli took decisions as good as his fielding,2
RCB need to get a bowling superstar. Chahal alone does not cut it,5
"ireespective of this match result, SRH should retain Warner, Kane and Rashid next auction",10
Imagine if Kohli hadn’t opened today,4
"Srh loses by 1 run 

You heard it here first",3
I dont know why Is Kane hated.. I preach him as my god..,4
Please don’t mess this up,3
This is where saini and siraj's run come in,4
When will Kohli learn Siraj is NOT a death over bowler.,3
It has been a brilliant effort from the bowlers. The batsmen shat the bed except AB and Finch.,9
ooo Lord got away with that,6
Ok but don't play that shot again thnx,8
Tension,6
RCBians - please don't blame your bowlers. This is a total fuckup by your batting,35
We'll take 8 or less from here off the last over,5
Srh would like 10 Motms,11
"Kohli giving advice, not gonna end well this",18
There's still a glimmer of hope,16
Should had hit the stumps,9
RCB's bowling is being let down by their batsmen. Tell this to someone in 2017 and he will call you mad.,27
SUPER OVER PLS,19
Fuck me!!! My heart is beating soo hard,19
Just hit a six and end us,29
[deleted],14
Good Guys SRH giving the ultimate birthday gift to Kohli by sending him home early.,10
Lord Siraj pls 1 dot,6
Excellent from Siraj has done pretty well.,8
Williamson really needs to add some muscle though,4
Take a bow Siraj. Now one more,9
Kanos trying too many things,5
10 off 7 balls is worrying.,5
"Guys...

*Super Over?*",12
Huh,2
"mumbai must be chuckling at this, these teams don't pose a threat to anyone but themselves",31
Kanos trying too many things,7
Imagine Dube Bowling the last over and winning it somehow. It's 2020 after all.,14
"9 need of the final over

Super Over anyone??",13
I'm just glad we finally got a close match after so many blowouts recently,17
"Md She-Raz , nice rapper name",5
SRH win. Calling it :(,6
MY HEART,4
Saini please bowl slower ones,5
Ah fuck.,2
That was a good over from Siraj!,9
This match isn't good for health,11
How many times has Williamson slipped today lol,3
Holder's poor running has cost SRH at least 4 runs,2
My heart is dhak dhak'ing,5
Bhenchod,1
He slipped?,2
It’s literally down the wire but doesn’t feel like so. I’m not sure why,1
"Now, can we have super over pleaseeeeee",2
Super Over,1
Why do you keep this little sliver of hope alive rcb,2
Stop hitting that stupid shot with a fielder there wtf,2
I'm reminded of NZ chase against SA last world cup. Williamson with the nerves of ice.,2
Omg my heart is not ready for this,3
wtf williamson?,1
SOME ONE CALL THE DOCTOR,4
Man that last over going for 13 is really the diff rn.,3
Great over from Siraj. Only boundary was from an edge.,3
Good camera work there with warner and Ipl trophy lol...could be greatest trailor shot if SRH wins the IPL lol,6
"We lost this


Kane on strike means its over in 3 balls vs Saini


I hope Kohli doesn't bowl Dube as a wildcard",2
Please not Saini,1
"It's scary that in a game which largely depends on luck and especially here on the toss, outside/inside edges etc, we invest our emotions and entire being into it, putting our mental health on line 😂",8
Oh boy the superover could be coming shortly,4
"Bruh this is going right to the wire, who’s gonna bowl the last over?",2
No superover please thanks,2
"Holy shit, the braindead Saini vs Kanos, wonder who wins here",1
Horrible timing for a slip,4
"oh boy

9 from the last over",4
"Kohli's comments after the match:

1. We were 20 runs short 
2. We didn't let the game get away from us until the end
3. We have played some pretty good cricket throughout the tournament to make it to the playoffs",14
This is going into super over zone now,4
My palms and feet are sweaty. I'm gonna die over this.,7
Super over probability intensifies😂😂👍🏽,3
"9 runs, with Holder and Kane on the crease it's our match to lose",2
Next over first ball is a Boundary. You read it first here.,5
Saini already had a great super over vs Hardik and Pollard. He can do it here.,5
Kane please.....,1
All on Saini now!!!,1
“ you have my respect RCB”,2
"spoiler warning ⚠ :

&#x200B;

rcb won the game by 1 run.",1
Kane seems tired,3
"Whichever teams wins today is going to the Finals.

DC is garbage.",0
That Mumbai super over match Saini is needed,6
I asked for 8 and the lord gave us 9! Fucking legend,9
"Come on... Kane, use your new zealand luck and push it to Super Over",5
Mumbai give us Bumrah for one over please,2
Good bowling by Siraj actually. Expected worse.,2
Super over pls,1
Williamson isn’t looking good,1
Please No Saini,3
"Super over, RCB winning it thereafter",1
RCB RCB RCB,1
Fuck man. Half my nails are gone.,2
Now see first 2 balls for boundry,2
9. 9! Tremendous effort from RCB to get it all the way here. Some luck going their way would be nice. That edged 4 hurt,2
Hyderabad better finish this in the first 3 balls otherwise whatever result happens it will be heartbreaking,4
"Me believing in every superstition possible in the last 6 balls.

Nobody better f**king get up!",6
Super over for sure,3
"S.    U.     P.      E.      R. 

O

V

E

R",6
Kane keeping the strike by slipping,2
I will give up my phone for a day if srh wins this,3
A Super Over would make my day,0
What is Siraj doing there?,3
[deleted],8
"Beautiful bowling by Siraj, was unlucky a bit there",3
Super over now?,2
no way srh fail here,1
Kane pls win this one. Pls,5
Heartbreak in 5 mins for either fan base. Feel sad for both.,16
"*Match gets close*

Commentators: It smells like super over in here",14
Dew is a factor afterall,2
Saini to end this in 3 balls,5
omg fucking god RCB is eliminated,5
We want super over.,1
SAINI PLS DONT BALL FAST,2
"Saini needs to work on his variations. ""Fuck it bowl fast"" doesn't work every time",5
How important were those 13 runs in the final over!,5
SRH - 3 wickets gone and it's 130 territory for them - tough to defend against DC,2
Let Finch ball !,2
Bruh super over pls,1
"Don't fall for that Josh ad, no one will win anything",7
I feel sick in my stomach,3
"This is ridiculous. Kane has to win this match from now on. It's his responsibility. And a loss will be on him. I'm sorry, but it's as it's.",7
Target 132. 6 wickets remaining. And SRH takes it to the last over.,1
"Congrats SRH, this is the match winning over. It's gonna be pretty difficult for Saini to defend anything less than 10.",7
"Irrespective of the result, it's a tremendous fightback from RCB. A breathe of fresh air this match after successive snooze fests in the past two weeks.",7
saini doesnt have enough guile or yorker ability to be a consistent bowler at the death,5
Ngl the way games have turned out in this IPL there's a chance this might be a superover as well.,6
This fucking team is gonna be the reason for my early 30s heart attack,13
Imagine kohli bowling final over,3
Give finch the over,3
Golden opportunity for RCB to shed their bottler and meme team image if they win this,5
Can Saini defend 9?,3
Idhar mere ko dhak dhak horre la hai,1
This is all pointless. MI is the thanos waiting to destroy whoever meets them anyway,1

What is the highest no of comments on a post on this reddit??,2
Kanos sweeping length bowls smh,1
"I don't expect super over here. Easy win for SRH. 

^(ready to eat my own words)",2
Williamson deserves this bruh,1
What’s the most comments on one of these threads??,2
Whyyyyyyyyyy Saini,2
Koach is smiling. Good to see that. Either he is relaxed or pretending to be relaxed.,5
If you're only 4 down you should definitely be able to chase 130. This is criminal,4
IK extras are something which happens but those extras can come biting very hard when it gets this close,2
All this tactics and Kanos will smoothly put the first ball out of the park.,0
Saini and Siraj made those run that matter. Now they have to defend that,5
Can I just say what a great job SRH has done this tournament. Lost 4 important players to injuries and still within touching distance of a semi final (equivalant),6
Those fucking wides Siraj started his over with,3
Saine or dube?,0
Do they use the same IPL trophy? As in is it running trophy or every year something new?,2
Oh god oh fuck I had forgotten how to deal with thrillers,6

Lose by 1 run,2
BC don't give me hope!!,1
Holder giveth. Holder taketh,3
Yo If holder connects it's over,1
Is Saini going on the Aus tour?,2
"If these guys or on crease and we don’t win, it’s embarassing",1
"Honestly if this game goes into super over, I can only imagine 2 guys

ABD & Rashid Khan 

Can't really imagine anyone else who is perfect for it.",3
"As a neutral...


I can't take the pressure.",19
Ass status - clenched,6
"As an MI fan, I want RCB to win this lol",8
Once the IPL is over there's a serious need to revisit this question: is gold dust even valuable considering how much these days earn?,5
Getting exciting.,3
This game is the perfect example of what it feels to be a RCB fan. Up and down up and down..,7
Srh congrats,1
Fuck off everyone except Warner and bowlers. Can't chase 132 :/,4

Somehow Saini doesn't inspire confidence,1

Holder-wan you're my only hope,1
Opinion : Kohli did right by opening today,9
Dube was a better option,1
A ex South African current indian and australian captain trying to get wickets of a current newzealand captain and ex Windies captain.,5

"lol sainis got a lot of learning to do

what the fuck were those balls",5
Yeah you can’t win with both captain of West Indies and New Zealand at the crease. They are captain for a reason.,5
"Kane, take a bow. Took complete control of the game",3
"GG boys played well. 

20 runs short speech loading",7
"Proud of RCB. Thanks for the entertainment.
We ll come back stronger.",4
Kohli bhosdk tm captaincy choodh do,1

All Hail God Kane Williamson!,7
"Very well done by RCB, incredible fighting effort. Now this next match for us is gonna be a cause of concern",5
"Low scoring thriller indeed. SRH matches are the most fun to watch, that's why they will be my favourites!",14
YASSSS!!!,3

Revenge for 2016 final taken",4
"What a fuckall ball. All the fielders on leg outside the ring, Saini kept bowling on off, lmao.",5
Saini follows the 'pace is pace yaar' rule.,5
Go to hell with that shite fielding.,2
Thats what experience gets you,2

Direct me to the depression thread,4

Thanks to the KiWi,3
Should have bowled Dube.,2
Meme team fails :(,5
"Peak shitposting, let's begin",3
[deleted],9
I don't understand why he'd bowl outside off when all his deep fielders are on the leg.,5
Kanos - The super cool dude.,5
Holder should be MOTM. Brilliant with the ball and with the bat crushed RCB again,7
Rcb fans don't know whether to be heartbroken or to be relieved that they don't have to deal with this shit anymore,13
I don't care that we won. I love that we defeated the arrogant kohli,13
 Yorkers outside off with third man and point inside. Nice captaincy,3
"It was a decent season, boys. See you next year!",3
"Saini. You might be more experienced than me but even an imbecile will understand that will you keep bowling the same ball, the batsman will know what to do. Atleast bowl to the field.",13
Kanos and MKBHD coming in clutch,5
Bairstow in the back fulfilling his role as SRH's human mascot,3
It's nothing new. 2020 is same as ever for us.,10
Fuck that was tense.,6
Saini 0 slower balls in his entire spell lmao,4
"Legit saw a comment on here saying : ""can't believe how shit Williamson is""

Inshahallah boys played well,5
Virat Kohli suffering a loss through the hands of a Kiwi part 2,12
Kane is just so good in these matches.,2
Great composure from Kanos and Holder in the end.,7
Remember the name. Jason Holderrrrrrr,1
Holder has been a decent addition to the SRH team,5
[deleted],0
That was a clutch innings by Williamson! Beautiful partnership between Kane and Jason.,4
Rcb to wait 6 more months for ee sala cup namade,1
Williamson for President :),5
Saini is such a dumb bowler. Why does he keep going for that wide Yorker? That should've gone to the stumps,7
And you guys were doubting KANOS. Smh.,8
KANOS SNAPPING FINGER AND ELIMINATING RCB,7
Another year of srh teabagging rcb,22
Jason fucking holder take a bow clutch player,4
Ee Saala Cup Tamte 😂😂😂😂😂😂,6
Adios RCB. Koach deserved this.,3
Feeling sad for Zampa,8
I need a shoulder to cry on,4
Kudos to rcb for restricting us until last over,9
Rcb aur delhi walo aisa hi khlena tha toh kkr aur punjab ko hi qualify karne dete,5
2 min silence for rcb fan boys,8
Atleast both team gave us a good game,8
Thank you everyone for this great season. See you next year,7
Fought well rcb,5
Kame is the greatest human being alive,7
Kane has been solid throughout but of course he chooses the game against us to deliver a decisive match winning knock.....,8
What a match!! Great innings under pressure from Linus Tech Tips,12
Either Holder or Kane getting it would mean it is the 8th unique MoM award for SRH this season.,8
Ee saala cup hoithu,5

5 losses in a row for the Royal Cucks from Bangalore. What a way to exit the tournament!,6
Absolute suifuel,2
So reverse jinxes do work huh,6
I always trusted my boy Kanos,7
Now Koach will say we bowled well. Agree zampa and chahal bowled well. But this will just overshadow all the bad decisions and bad batting of the team.,6
yesssss! this makes me very happy! fuck off rcb!,8
and now my watch endeth..,7
"Irrespective of the result, this is the kind of match badly needed. Happy as a SRH fan but what a stiff competition from RCB. RCB’s bowling trumps batting this season!!",11

Good guys are winning all over again. Back to regular scheduled programming,4
Protect them at all costs.,7
Kane is clutch,6
"RCB 2019 : 6 losses in the first six matches

This year : 5 losses at the back end of the tournament",10
Holder or Kanos for Man of the match?,8
Kane fucking Williamson and Jason fucking Holder have pulled a rabbit out of the hat for SRH.,12
Happy faces,2
Guess it's Next Sala again,9
The finesse with which Kane handled the situation was amazing to watch.,13

"Dew is a cheat code

And we lost the last 4 tosses",7
Poor ABD can’t catch a break. Atleast give my man a final,8
Well congratulations SRH! I know many of us are not in good mental state but we gave our best kudos to Kanos  and best wishes for next game!,16
Kohli wanted to reach Australia before Warner.,19
"Hey RCB, welcome to the 'out of the tournament' club! 🙃",3
Change the flair mates,9
"Inb4 

Kohli : Boys didn't express themselves & they were 15-20 runs short !!!",3

Said by SRH official instagram handle",20

It's beyond meme thing for me now.",15
Williamson hugging Holder is just...pure bromance,29

HOLDER MY BEER while I bring everything back to normalcy,8
"Kanna devan tea podi, RCB ku seruppadi",5
And r/Cricket sucking up to Kanos continues xD,7
CG fireworks? Lol.. I should've expected that after a season full of fake fan noises.,6
Oh Kane daddy,6
Didnt really expect that fight from RCB bowlers.. hard luck.,18
How could you all shitpost against kane????,6
"So much drama for 132 Target , even when 6 wickets were in hand. SRH batting is paper-thin.",12
Rcb would've won if they had won the toss,4
"1. 20 runs short
2. AB no play
3.bye

-Kohli",8
"Kane showed why SRH made a great decision of picking him over Bairstow. Kudos to management too because once Saha is injured, they could have panicked and brought in Bairstow.",13
I hope Saha is back for the next game.,12
Wanted srh to win but that was questionable captaincy,12
"> Lost opportunities, lost possibilities. That’s what part of it means to be alive",3
"GG BOIS, WE PLAYED WELL congo SRH fans and thanks for destroying our hopes for another season",12
I hate the fact that Kohli is a GOAT but trophies keep eluding him. Sucks.,20
Kohli needs to realise Iyer can't bail him out everytime,10
Williamson-san and Holder-chan!!! ❤️❤️❤️ 😍,17
"""20 runs short"" incoming",5
I reckon we were 10 runs short lmao.,8
Kanos worth is realised today,8
The 2020 twist for RCB has been their batting shitting the bed and depending on their bowling.,8
"RCB   🤝    KXIP

Five losses in a row",26
I love how we went from least likely to make the playoffs to most likely to finish 2nd to MI,5
Hope Saha recovers by Q2. This game was closer than it should've been.,9
how long is saha out for?,6
Man I'm so happy right now :),10
"You know what they say

Lads",3
Ayo where is that rcb win predicter guy now lmao,7
Well done SRH. But please go all the way and break the Mumbai hegemony,18
"In all fairness RCB bowled well, Siraj did mess up in the last over though",12
Sunny salty af,5
Feel bad for koach,7
What a game of cricket after the one-sided shitshows last week,12
"Inb4 ""we were 20 runs short""",7
"Delhi now have to play our two bogey teams to win the IPL. Watch as, in true fairytale fashion, we lose to SRH",3
Think I lost NNN to Kanos,11
Lmao Haddin's face when he saw Warner getting up is priceless,8
"Death bowlers are supposed to take wickets in the death overs, but look at ours. Oh well, last year of me supporting RCB. Last year of me watching IPL. Was fun when it lasted. Congrats, SRH fans.",1
And now RCB gets eliminated after 5 losses in a row. Some normalcy in 2020.,7
Good to see an interest eliminator rather than a one sided one!,10
At least RCB fought back. Y’all are way too toxic,14
RCB have lost 5 matches in a row now.,7
now you know why we lost the world cup.  why the f would you monkey with the batting order in a crucial knockoff match ?,8

But in big games, Virat almost always shits the bed as a batsman; constantly gets out < 10 runs early, especially in ODIs. And his captaincy is mediocre at best.

India needs to move on from him as a captain already. Let him focus on what we really need from him; batting. Give one of the other vets a chance to lead the team.",12

"I can't see SRH winning this tourney, their batting still hasn't fully come to the party, aside from Warner and his consistency, and a couple innings from Saha and Pandey, their middle order has largely proved to be hit and miss. They come out on top here, but they struggled to chase this small total; they also failed against Kings XI. They could get to the finals by beating sides who are short on confidence in RCB and DC, however I don't see them stopping the might and force that is the juggernauth that is Mumbai Indians.",7

Everyone's potentially equally arrogant, it just comes out when our team wins. Fuck you and see you on Sunday.",57

1) play Gurkeerat in and out at random times, at the expense of Dube who was not too bad. 

2) send Washington and Dube out before ABD

3) give Philippe a couple of tries and then revert to Finch at random. 

4) play Moeen Ali at will and not let him settle down in the middle order (despite his 150+ strike rate). 

5) not use Zampa enough. Bench him after one bad match where Pollard was monstrous.  

6) randomly bringing back Steyn who was atrocious.  

7) randomly give one game to Shahbaz, and then bench him, even though he was instrumental in getting you through to the playoffs. 

8) playing an overseas bowler in udana and giving him only one over to bowl sometimes, or two at most. 

Any more?",38

But I'm satisfied with just qualifying. Anything more is just a bonus.",18
"Man, my heart was at 180 BPM in the last few overs. Thankfully the cool heads of Kane and Jason got us over the line.

RCB was definitely about 20 runs short on this wicket, but their tactic of a spin heavy lineup definitely gave them a fighting chance.

As an SRH fan, I hope Saha is fit for the next match against DC. The Warner wicket was a 50-50 call, so given my bias I would say it should have stayed not out. Nonetheless, the strategy of dropping Jonny (as tough as it was) to have both Kane and Jason in the middle order was the right call and it showed today.

Now let's hope they can put on a good performance to beat DC in a couple days. 

Been fun all, till next match. Good game!",18

Are you guys for real? The circle jerk of Kohli hate on RCB threads is moronic.Yes he is a sub-par LOI captain but if you think RCB have a better captaincy option right now, let's hear it. 

RCB have progressed in this edition; there are a few tangible improvements which, if sustained, should stand them in good stead. They have a few components needed in a championship team, just need to develop the team further.",34
Warner has been quite unlucky this season. He had a dodgy call today as well as that infamous KXIP game. He is second in Orange cap race but hasn't won a MoM yet. He should eventually get some good luck his way and score a huge century in the next two games preferably the final.,30

good find for RCB, now dont release him next auction lol.",21
It's just like any other year for rcb. I'm glad bowling is so good. Also team was table topper for 4 hours :),18
These awards are so cringe,7

I am not crying copium got into my eyes,7
At least ABD got the mini Altroz award thing. That will soothe some wounds.,17
"Kanos, sorry for doubting your abilities..",19
Kanos is a genius mathematician at times! I can't think of any other batsman backing himself with those deft touches even when the required run rate is around 10. Phew!,27
'Deccan Chargers' defended 132 in that famous league match in 2012 which ended up costing RCB a playoff spot,28
"ok i know this sub hates Kohli and This might feel like an excuse but seriously virat is very very unlucky, gets out to screamers, picks out a fielder perfectly, tactics which may come off for any other player won't come off for him, and the usual losing toss

These always make him like a really bad player but seriously for any other player atleast one will come off",14
Warner is giving away the secret,27
RCB VS SRH RIVALRY IS SO UNDERRATED,40
"In the post match discussion at cricinfo, Gauti is really heaping on kohli. He is blaming him for all ills. I am not sure he is wrong. I feel kohli should have batted lot better than what he did.",11
Auzzie praising a Kiwi😂👍🏽,17
"5 matches of batting first

5 matches of ordinary opening partnership

5 matches of slow middle over run rates

5 matches of good bowling which wasn't good enough

5 matches of ""we were 25 runs short""",17
Ohhh SRH fans ffs calm down with the reverse jinxes for the next match already.,14
Only thing RCB did right in last 5 matches that they lost to DC by smallest margin.,15

"Positive thing for RCB ? Same team will play again in 6 months. 

Still feel Washington, Chahal, Saini, Siraj has to form the bowling core. 

Dube is not the finisher RCB wants, get in some else. Even a Foreigner will do, anyway Aaron Finch is going out.",7
"God damn RCB, you are slowly shedding the tag of batting only team. Hope the Chinnaswamy allows you to do the same next year",13
Koach wasnt relieved of his duties to persue his true passion - Abso-fkin-Lutely destructive Batting without much else to do on field,11
"Nattu is a dad?!

Damn, congrats na! Kallakunga!",50
How is Warner so wholesome with the SRH but a jerk with Aus?,68
"Ask him about Saha, Harsha. The nation wants to know!",13
"We look like a joke right now, sandwhiched between MI and SRH. Well, Sunday's gonna close the deal once and for all, let's see what happens.",22
"Warner: 'Shikhar is in form'.   


He scored three ducks in a row.",49
Williamson for MOTM take that you fucking doubters,18
Happiest person today: SELVALAKSHMI!!,22
"You have to give credit where it's due. SRH has been marred with injuries (Bhuvi, Marsh, Saha) and still managing to somehow scrape through.",39
I thought holder deserved it more,10
CA is a cuck for not giving limited-overs captaincy to Warner. They don't have the guts to be successful anymore unlike the golden years.  He has made a team of mediocre Indian players into a champion team. Imagine what he can do with international quality Aussies.,23
Warner said Shikhar is in form. Can't be more accurate. 😂,29
Whoever dislikes Harsha needs help. This guy is a delight and a great person to talk to.,65
"With Morris in the team, RCB could have put up a better fight.",14
"Harsha, can you ask Kane how it feels to stab Bairstow in the back.",14
"I love Kohli and he is my favorite player 
Kinda feels melancholic to see him look so downcast and disappointed
GG RCB that was one heck of a match",20
The only reason I would like MI losing is to see that man Kano smile( after a cup win).,36
"Whatttttttt???? How is Holder not Man of the Match? 


Fuck bowlers, right?",23
Kanos is so wholesome🥺🥺👍🏽,47
"Harsha to Kanos on his MoM: Is that the loudest Aussies have cheered for you. 
I think they also cheered for WC final",37
[deleted],22
"Me :(

kane smiles.

Me :)",44
"The only chance for Delhi is to bat first based on what I have seen. Get to 160 odd and bank on the bowling to do the job. 

They can’t chase against SRH because the like attacking Rashid so much. Hopefully, while batting first they won’t feel the need as much.",19
"Wtf was that laugh, Kanos! xD",15
MoM should have been holder. 3-25 is really good. and 24 off 20 to finish it off.,30
Harsha should have asked warner about his dismissal.,19
Jason Holder was the player of the match for me. Dismantle the batriarchy.,24
"Gavaskar makes a good point.

Also good to see and hear Neroli again😀👍🏽",-1
RCB cunts were drunk to the core yesterday night and today's performance reflected it,10
"Koach: Good to see my boyfriend score a 50?

AB and Kane: Thanks, Virat!",33
Lara is looking like a pimp.,7
"Guess what I realized it's my cake day and SRH won too.

Couldn't get any better....",52
So SRH move on to finals?,13
"Kane says holder is cooler than me

Kane vs holder the epic battle of koolness",62
RCB players were so drunk yesterday that Ravi Shastri was the only sober guy there,26
Why even have Man of the Match... just rename it to Batsman of the Match,8
"Man of the match is not best performance of the match its not about dream 11 points they gave holder that award. 

It's supposed to be about impact without kanos there was no victory here.",19
"It's been 30 mins now, RCB SM handles haven't posted any new update yet... letting fans to cool down I guess lol",18
Man Sunny G really hates SRH,63
"To those asking for Kohli to he removed as captain, it is not going to happen. His brand brings in money for RCB which is more important than winning a trophy for the owners. In the end, IPL is a business and they will do whatever makes more financial sense.",57
Didn't kohli come for the presentation?,-3
Honestly I am not feeling sad am I right? I am not feeling anything lol,32
Sunny hates younger players for some reason.,20
"If a young Indian fan started watching cricket two years ago, they probably would be scratching their head at what the hype around Kohli is all about",46
How bad is Saha's injury? Will he be able to play the 2nd Qualifier?,21
"Sorry RCB fans, Really No sarcasm. They are the most loyal fans 13 seasons without cup and seeing them go down each time hurts as cricket lover but they simply dont have a good management.

Happy as a SRH fan and delighted to see we knocked off RCB again. 2009, 2016 2020. it must be heart breaking for kohli and fans",39
staunchwebster on suicide watch,11
"To the idiots screaming cHaNgE tHe cAptAiN, haven't you learned anything from what happened with KKR?",-14
"Alright. I think we should really appreciate coach hesson and management, because the last 3 years were literally shit shows for RCB, I mean we were favourites to get the wooden spoon. Reaching playoffs in the maiden year as coach is quite an achievement especially with all the baggage that we had from the last 3 seasons. This time bowling has started to look good too, in fact better than the batting, how's that for a turnaround.",37
"IPL is not really real cricket anyway

*cries in Kohli*",24
Anyone know why Paddikal played over Baristow?,-25
"GG RCB. SRH, two more to go.",36
"SRH has a decent squad selection. Inspite of major injuries the progress till now was superb...


What a replacement Holder has been...


What a backup Goswami has been, though he didn't contribute with the Bat, he was the reason why SRH could play Kane and Holder Today.


Only changes for next match should be Saha in for Goswami if fit, and Abhishek Sharma for Garg.. we need an exrra left hander in that middle order, just to counter Axar left arm spin.


Two more to go Boys...",32
Reminder that IPL is Mickey Mouse cricket and nobody gives a shit about Kohli’s performance here as a player and captain as long as we win the real Cricket in Australia in the next few months.,43
Why wasn’t Saha playing? Is he going to play against DC?,16
What is Saha’s status? Will he back for the qualifier or is he done?,24
"Kohli after every match, ""we were a few runs short"".",29
"If KXIP don't retain Maxwell, would RCB buy him?",23
"At this point, I feel guilty while mocking RCB fans which is every surprising given mocking RCB used to be my favourite thing to do. In all seriousness, they deserve better.",51
Why is sunny simping on TV rn?,24
Man Sunny G and his Mumbai bias is kinda annoying.,59
Manish Pandey. Khoon kab khaulega re tera.,40
At this point I just hope anybody other than Mumbai wins,54
I’m literally heart broken,8
"Holder a mere beholder of motm award

but such is life",18
"When I was watching the game our batsman weren't doing well, so I stopped watching and try to distract myself from not even watch the score. Just checked. Thank god we won.",39
I think only way srh can beat mi again is if Warner goes berserk,19
"I mean RCB is always gonna loose the game between overs 16-20. Even though bowling has been pretty good this year in fact better than the batting, but we still miss out on a major superstar international bowler and in these high pressure situations especially in crucial matches experience matters a lot. We miss out on that. Like imagine someone among the likes of Lockie, Bumrah, Shammi, Boult. These bowlers can save 9 in 6. Hopefully we'll fix this in the next auction.",14
"Time for Koach to give up captiancy? We haven't won shit in 7 years of his tenure. Barring that superhuman season of 2016, most of his seasons have been above average and team's season just pretty bad.

For a guy earning 17.5CR per season, you at least gotta make it to final",19
"Unpopular opinion: the playoff format is really stupid and mathematically makes it almost impossible for the 3rd and 4th team to win.

The old format of 1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3 semi final is fine. 

If you want to tweak it, 1 gets to pick the ground and the toss call for their match. 2 gets to pick the toss call. That’s it.",2
I [knew ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jp3yo7/match_thread_eliminator_royal_challengers/gbcyeu3?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) it. Just didn't want it to happen,11
"Really wish in mega auction, RCB doesn't retain anyone. Build everything from the grounds up.",15
Would Finch and Philippe be retained?,7
"I support Dc as an rcb fan ,hope they go on to win thier first ipl trophy,not easy have to beat strongest teams .Common DC !!",12
"Lost 5 in a row now. Smh... New season, same story. 

We've changed everything since the first IPL. Coach, captians, planning everything. Except Koach.

He's my all time favourite batsman but his captiancy is just mind numbing. Goes on record stating he's not a big believer of data in circket while seeing Sandeep Sharma dismissing him every season.",26
Does anyone among you think Morris could've saved 9 in 6?,13
Is it normal that I still love this team so much?,22
"Would love to see mega auction and no retention by teams. 

Most expensive buy will be Bumrah followed by Rohit/Kohli.",21
"Sunny  G: Bam Bam Bam Bam Bambai

BAmba~~n~~i humko jamgayi",10
Did my Man Sunny G say Saini is too inexperienced? Smh,26
"For all those who thought Bairstow should have been selected over Kane, I hope this innings is proof enough for you. He was chosen to stabilize the middle order and ensure that runs keep flowing even if wickets fall at the other end. While many may not have liked the number of dot balls he played initially, I think it was more important for him to take his time and find the fence occasionally. The asking rate was not overly high so  he did not have to take risks and get out. The fact that he pulled it off along with Holder under so much pressure is the reason why Kane Williamson is so amazing.

Also Jason Holder, wow! 3 wickets and the match winning runs. And so consistent. What an IPL he has had after being unsold in the auction.",90
RCB next auction: ~~EThnic~~ cleansing!!,18

"Just wish all karntaka players  to play in rcb like kl Rahul,Mayank ,Manish , karun , Robin Uthappa.",11
"Delhi are facing the Karna predicament.

*We know SRH (Pandavas) are the only ones who can stop MI (Kuravas) from destroying the future and integrity of Hastinapur (IPL). But we must be true to our duties and fight against SRH anyway.*

And we will do exactly what Karna did, lay our weapons down for SRH to kill us lol.",68
"I think RCB will bid for Raina if he comes into auction. They need an Indian batsman at 4 or 5. Otherwise, they could try for Captain Karun from KXIP or replicate another DDP by grooming some U19 youngster. Hesson has been great this season and they will only get better next time around.",23
"Kohli has been well below his usual standards in last 2 years. I am really looking forward to Border-Gavaskar Trophy to see how he performs. If he gets <250 runs in 4 tests, then I am afraid any good innings in future will be described as 'Vintage Kohli' meaning he is past his peak.",23
Which one should be in my team. Toxtricity or Pikachu,11
"With low scoring totals, Kane is a beast in chasing, put him in the scenario of MI DC's game yesterday, and he would fall.",-46
"Problem with the rcb is the lack of belief in their players. They had the likes of KL Rahul , Gayle , Mayank , Stoinis and many more . When they didn't perform what did they do? They sold them. Had they stuck with them and groomed them , this side would've been a force to reckon with. Look at mumbai, they groomed suryakumar , ishan kishan. Only grooming they've done is that of Chahal. That's it. They stick with the likes of Siraj and Umesh but leave golden players like Kl , mayank , stoinis. Smh.",40
"Hope DC or SRH beat MI.
MI is easily the most solid team and deserve to win.
But let there be a new champ xD
Preferably DC",26
Poor Finch will be sold now! Dumb management of RCB. Hate to be RCB fan for years now but only reason I still am is Abraham Benjamin Devillers ♥️,28
"SRH at it's absolute best!!
Too much to love about this team <3",23
"Is this the real life?

Is this just fantasy?

Caught in a collapse,

No escape from Dubeji

Open your eyes,

Look up to the scorecard and see,

We're just a poor team, we need some sympathy,

Because I'm easy bowled, easy caught

Never high, always low,

Any way the scorecard goes.

Doesn't really matter to me, to me.

(Tribute to RCB's 2020 Campaign)",65
"Koach literally has been controlling RCB for nearly 10 years now. He once so badly wanted Yuvi who was past his prime, RCB management Mallya, paid 16 crores for him. 

That's the frustrating thing about Koach. He will never let any team coach have even half control and execute their plan. He always tries to heavily influence and decide team selections and get his favorite close rapport players in, try permutations combinations and messes up. 

His batting has been below par for past few seasons and his inner Koach instinct snd pressure vis causing all the trouble. It's a double whammy. 

He should simply handover captaincy to someone else and prove again that he still the feared batsman. He is still young and is super fit but his performances for RCB are fading away real quick. 

His stubborn nature and bad judgement of strategy is hurting the team a lot and also the mood in the senior players. He is one overworshipped control freak at RCB franchise. And it's clearly not been yielding results for 10 years now. 

I hope he steps down from captaincy, focuses on his batting and let some experienced bloke handle captaincy. 
It will do him and RCB real good.",12
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined,6
Still sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,1
TIL kane has higher SR than Kohli in IPL,1
Rcb was kil,1
