"Here for some good ol' spice that only RCB can dish out. Thank you for existing IPL. I'm glad you're here. 

Given the game yesterday, I'm just here for the shits, giggles and of course, maymays. Come on RCB do something special!!",30
Woah Koach's first IPL after a break. Hyped much?!?!,10

"I‚Äôm more worried about our pace bowling than our batting. I‚Äôm dead serious. What makes post-injury Bhuvi+ some combination of Sandeep/Khaleel/Kaul/Thampi better than RCB‚Äôs supposed meme bowling attack of Saini, Siraj and Yadav? I think Saini alone is better than all our pace bowlers currently.",8
RCB to win this. ü§û,3
Love watching ali play. But i don't think he gets a place in this team,1

I don't support any IPL team. I just want the RCB memes to continue so I'll root for SRH here,14
Oh wow so when kohli gives himself a haircut he looks good and when I do it I look like a bear,1
Have a bit of fun with the boys if you know what I mean hehehe,1

Is this how it feels to be an aussie?",9
Really weird that Marsh is playing before Nabi and Williamson,4
"No mujeeb yesterday

No nabi today

oh nvm parthiv isnt playing,3
"Marsh at 7 over nabi is interesting, not like nabi hasn't had game time, just played the whole cpl.",1
"Marsh is a weird selection. Williamson is obviously a much better batsman, and Nabi is a much better allrounder (especially batting at 7)",4
So how many balls will Steyn bowl before he gets injured again?,-1
"FFS!!

Who is going to bowl at death RCB?",3
No morris? I know he bowls pies but considering that RCB look short of bowling options,1
Josh Philippe. OK. This season gonna be fun.,1
Whyd Tom Moody leave?,1
I knew Kane wasn‚Äôt gonna make it and somehow I‚Äôm still disappointed,11
why no Kane ?,1
RCB team looks scary on paper,5
"Bhenchod Kohli, no Moeen, y u do dis",2
Looks like its in r/cricket 's hands to meme Marsh into a quick 50,3
Philippe down to open or bat in the middle?,1
"feeling 2016 RCB this,even after the team selection.",4
Khaleel Ahmed should have been there :(,1

Alright booiis! I'm hyped,1
Release Kane to some other team ffs. So that I don't have to spend half hour being frustrated on his omission. Fucking Banter club!,4

Can any non-SRH supporter name an Indian player or players they‚Äôre willing to exchange for Kane?,2
Hey guys do you think Finchy and Warner's mateship will be put on hold for today's game????,1
good god the Indian broadcasters love to ride Kohli's dick. He is not even the best Indian T20 batsmen the last few years. It is honestly pathetic,6

It feels weirdly exciting being RCB fan,2
that rap was awful,4
kane and rahane deserve to lead a team of their own.,2
Playing 4 overseas is a new norm or it's been there before too ?,-7
The Guilt PTSD of supporting RCB only ONCE has already kicked in.,2
Open with Umya!,1
"Philippe isn't a very good wicket keeper, you have been warned, [but he is fun to watch bat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytLCWYLv4z0). Interested to see him bat down the order, as soon as he looked half decent down the order the sixers made him open.",-1
"My brain still can't comprehend the thought of Bairstow and Warner playing cricket for the same team and enjoying one another's company, it's some Twilight Zone shit nobody will ever understand",121
I really wouldn't mind a Kane train swap with DC for 2-3 good Indian middle order batsmen,6
"Oof, no Chris Morris or Moeen Ali.",3
Sunrisers middle order is terrible lol. Did they not realize in the auction that they might have picked too many unproven and inexperienced u19 players ?! I understand there trying to build for the future but I want them to win a trophy too..,1
"RCB batting Is the Typical Indian Physiology

Can someone help with stats of AbDv vs SRH?,0
"Happy for Natarajan.

Finally a game after 2 years benching warming.",4
Rcb lower middle order is very weak. One of either abd or kohli have to bat till the end.,4
"Just tuned in, it makes me laugh how much these franchises rate players who performed well in BBL. Joshua batting at 5 in a T20 game is ridiculous.",0
"Trade Kanos to CSK, he would be a perfect top order batsman for us",7
cant wait for some fielding porn from pandeyji,11
Phillipe over Morris? Are you fucking kidding me? And Marsh over Kane/Nabi? Wow,0
"weird picks for SRH. no khaleel, samad or williamson. idk how much marsh adds tbh. 7 bowling options, but only 4 proper batsmen (of which garg has very little experience).",1
Let's show some hate towards Dube,-13
"solid 10D plan there by kohli, playing Josh in the XI and killing the Australian future",2
RCB seem a batsman short. One top order batsman should be the anchor,-1
Weird to say this but doesn‚Äôt rcb lack batting with this lineup?,2
"I'm very excited for this game. I want to see clutch performance from Kohli, AB, Steyn, and Warner. Pity one of my two favourite cricketer, Kane, isn't playing.",6
"There was a time when RCB top 5 was Gayle, Kohli, Devilliers, Rahul, Watson. DAMN!!!",11

good evening gents,1
Kohli to open or will it be Finch?,1
Want steyn to show some r/deathrattleporn,0
Steyn going full Lebowski lmao,1
"This is a good day, get to watch Steyn bowl today.",1
Morris was not 10cr worth. RCB choked even in the auction,-2
"Stfu guys, you don't know the reason why Morris is not playing..What if he's injured/not well",2
2 U19 players. Just wow. So fuckin excited here,3
David Warner Is the Typical Australian Physiology TOP HEAVYY and skinny much skinny and weak the more you go down,-1
Once again on paper we look like we should win,4
"Damn, that RCB side is packed with international players. I want to see how they won't win the trophy this season.",3
The scenes if Finch runs out his captain,4
Imagine having Kane Williamson in your squad and not playing him. Shoulda just released him. It boils my blood so much.,86
Rashid looks older than Prithiv Shaw,2
"Honestly don't mind the 'weak' batting order of RCB. Batting below 7 you barely get a few overs to bat and with Kohli and ABD, the plan would be that one of them stays till the end. No need to waste a better batsman at that spot. Just play good bowlers who can defend totals. That said playing Mo would have been better but that would mean Parthiv would have to play over Padikkal. In terms of Mo+Parthiv or Joshua+ Padikkal, I might want to give Padikkal a few games to see how he goes. He has been in stellar form in domestics.",5
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Devdutt Padikkal. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Padikkal. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",49
I'm sorry but RCB's bowling lineup actually looks good? What's happening,3
"I'll be honest, they probably didn't need to put the plane icon under Bairstow's name. Not too many people were getting confused about that one.",1
Why RCB match threads always attracts downvoting brigade?,7
Wanted to watch Kanos bat. Would now have to settle for Bairstow-Warner bromance. They better headbutt each other as a celebration.,2
Let's all hope the umpires don't f this up.,3
Last year it was Yadav. This year it's Styn. With the mullets,1
The only ray of sunshine is Nattu's inclusion. Man was ignored for 2 seasons and finally got his due today. Hoping for the best.,2
"So fucking excited to see Rcb again and ab and Virat, hopefully they both get going today and get a massive partnership",3
Finch is gonna go out for a duck lbw bhuvneshwar,3
Two really good teams.,5
Seeing all the good overseas players and then Mitch Marsh appears. Couldn‚Äôt they have gotten a better all-rounder,3
I think they are playing Phillippe because he probably had a really great net session,3
Ee sala cup namdhe. Let's go boiiiii,5
RCB's kit looking as sexy as ever,3
So when will Lara join select dugout. I hope he replaces Swann,-2
"Another season, another Parthiv Patel dropping at the start. 

He'll be back halfway through the season when it's too late and the team (again) realises that he's the third most reliably consistent batsman in the team.",7
The whole rcb bowling depends on Steyn,2
Finch will score above 30,2
Who is this bloke padikkal,2
"Kohli destroys Tim ""Virat Doesn't Like You"" Paine, by playing Finch",3
I can't wait to see kohli bat. It's been far too long. Let's gooooo I am fucking stoked.,3
Excited for padikal but I hope he starts firing from the next game,2
Feels like forever since I last saw boobie,6
Lets fucking goooo,3
"Nah sorry Kohli has to open. His best season was when he opened, shocking why he refuses to open time and time again in T20s",-2
long time no see Bhuvi,0
looking forward to *Finch b Bhuvi/Sandy*,2
Yess Paddikkal is playing! Excited,2
All ready to upvote all RCB memes again today. Let's meme this team to glory boys!!!,2
Khaleel is 100% a better bowler than Sandeep,-3
Any one got any streaming link that works in india other than hotstar?,1
Finchy vs bhuvi <3,1
Ipl is helping me deal with this Coronavirus better than i expected.,1
Finchy Lbw in 4 balls,3
"Just turned my tv volume up, heard KP, turned it down again",4
Bhuvi's bunny Finch is here.,1
Srh should just trade Williamson at this point. Too good to be on the bench.,4
13 matches with 6 fifties at a 175 SR. Awesome stats there,4
tell me more about this Padikkal fella,1
"Alright RCB, take away the ‚Äòstupidity spotlight‚Äô away from us",3
Finch would destroy that young leggie of SRH,2
Bhuvi just did a Bancroft there. When's Warner gonna change?,2
"If SRH will not be playing Kane, I'm going to switch my support to RCB. How do you know not play a player who scored 700+ runs when your best player/captain was banned and last year's WC finalist captain?",2
Bro apparently Finch has played in 8 franchise in IPL,33
Will boobie make a comeback into the India squad?,1
"Opener plays 2 dots...

RCB fans: Start smashing already",4
Devdutt looking good to see out the new ball.,4
That fucker nitin menon is still there.,1
Who is the 6th bowler for RCB? Dube?,2
Please keep Finch away from Bhuvi if the bowling is going to swing and seam around.,5
"Good eve guys, checking-in from Chennai.",2
They have awarded permanent Orange cap to Warner...,5
"What's with double cap for captains... Warner here, Morgan in England, some kinda thing?",3
Oh god that smile. Bhuvi is so fucking good looking,7
Aaargh those vuvuzelas are back,1
Warner and kohli won't tolerate incompetence from nitin menon. Some punches will be thrown. Warner has some experience in it. Ask joe root.,-2
Did anybody's hotstar just give out?,1
I'd like to think Koach gets beard tips from Mo.,3
Warner vs Kohli. Battle of the ultimate chad.,4
udana wouldve been useful here,1
Lol the one time Kohli wouldn't want Bhuvi to trap Finchy. IPL creates weird scenarios,7
The crowd noise if way too loud. Won't even be able to hear an edge over this,4
I think I'm going to need therapy to revive my soul if RCB finishes this season at 7th or 8th position,4
Only SRH has the luxury of having Indian pacers like Khaleel and Kaul on bench. Hope Natarajan takes his chance.,3
Every ball these two face is a ball Umesh Yadav isn't smashing for 6. SRH winning.,4
Bunny vs Hunter.,1

Please get Finchy to face Boobie for the entire over next.,3
Can someone list all the Franchise in IPL Finch has played in.,3
Finchy getting bowled or LBW by a Bhuvi inswinger. Calling it now.,3
Nothing like watching cricket whilst stuck in the ER. I feel like craaaaaap,1
I have a feeling Pitches wont be high scoring here in UAE. Makes it for exciting cricket,5
Bhuvi can swing both ways,1

They just had to play Sandeep 'Pie chucker' Sharma.,1
thatll calm him down,1
"Two of the best indian swing bowlers against finchy

Gotta be fun",3
Lets goooooo,1
"New #3 found 

&#x200B;

/s",1
"The crowd noise for boundaries is better today, yesterday it was really abrupt and fake sounding",10
How come the ball automatically starts to move in when Aaron Finch is on strike,11
Of course I forgot we allow new players to get confidence against us,6
Marsh quota being availed I see in SRH,2
Khaleel picked up 19 wickets in 9 matches last season. An average of 15.1.,2
Sandeep hasnt been same after he made his debut in Zimbabwe. He wasnt unplayable a few seasons before,1
No KP. No one is happy playing for RCB.,2
Hindi commentary never sucked so much.,3
Sandeep is proven to be lethal against Koach but still tough bargain for Khaleel,3
Padikkal looks gooooood,6
"Having spent the whole of the Blast watching sides open with spin from one end, this is weird",1
I love Padikkal,5
*He he he we are in danger*,6
Never heard of Paddikal in u19,3
Great timing by Padikkal. Gotta come up with a decent nickname for him.,3
warner already with the orange cap.,7
Best way to comfortably settle a new Indian batsman in the IPL is to bowl a medium pace trundled like Sandeep Sharma early on.,7
Padikkal seems to be strong off his pads.,2
"So it begins. Sandeep ""hit me please"" Sharma.",1
Feeling guilty for wishing these two get out so that I can see Kohli and AB bat,2
Fuck it!,1
"'He wants to play for RCB'

I thought it was largely considered a punishment to be at a team that can't punch above the weight it should",3
holy shit did we find a good young indian batsman,3
"Good save , saved 2runs",1
This isn't IPL fielding we are used to,5
I told you this Kid was something special.,5
Big brain tactics from Finch here - play for RCB this season to ensure god like form when he switches teams again next year,12
[removed],3
This guy looks promising,3
"Awesome, he seems so chilled playing rn",7
The crowd noise is too loud for the commentators.,6
"How do you pronounce padikkal?
Like Pad - ee-kul?",2
Sandeep's lost another yard of pace this year. Shadow of the bowler he once was.,2
Heard a lot about Devdutt. Looks promising. Cant wait to see him leave RCB and fulfill his potential.,9
Mandatory boundaries by the newbie against SRH,1
Bairstow looks weird in this much orange. Less is more YJB,3
How did that not go for 4,3
Could have played both Sandeep and Khaleel and drop Natarajan,0
Why doesn't Sandeep go play for some county side. Such a good swinger of the ball. Isn't progressing bowling in Indian Pitches.,5
"Two boundaries in the last few balls.

SRH fans: panik",6

"Cricket gods will be struggling to keep feeding our insatiable appetite for drama after last nights match. Today's match will end in an LBW appeal so controversial, that Wikileaks will end up having to release the algorithm for ball-tracking. It turns out a lazy engineer on hourly wage decided to not write the code that was assigned to him but instead called a random variable to decide the result of every ball-tracking decision. Apparently, it's been like that since 2015. Outrage ensues, however, in the end, RCB ends up losing anyway, as is tradition.",2
"can't get bat on ball, finch looking terrible so far",3
ah 3d shankar,2
No Kane Williamson??,2
Sandeep is the type of bowler who gets a wicket cause batsmen feel too bad to see him run with 4 ft height and throw pies consistently.,4
Warner saving the DRS for when he needs to review a short run,6
Finchy should bat down the order so he can come in when the ball has stopped moving and just cunt the spinners,2

Moeen is an elite hitter of spin, proven in IPL, has been getting time in the middle for England, a great captain who could provide assistance to Kohli and he can bowl!",4
ah fuck pls no,1
Ofcourse he is injured.,2
After looking at Padikkals cricinfo page and watching him face 18 balls I can confidently say that he will play 300 tests and score 50 ashes tons,145
Padikkal can/will replace Dhawan in 2-3 years time if he keeps improving,6
He got scared.,4
Oh shoooot not Marsh,6
Wtf Mitch Marsh was my cap'n today,6
Injury premier league,9
Oh dear. Not an injury this early,4
it's 3d Shankar time,9
Not another injury,3
Philippe is a gun. Such a clean striker of the ball. If Padikkal can keep this up then RCB have a seriously great top 5,1
Injury PL ?,2
Okay I know the marsh memes are incoming but he bowled so well during the england series and his lid looks brilliant and he seems like the nicest guy ever just thought I'd mention xx,5

Who will be Marsh's replacement?,6
Marsh doing more damage here than good,9
Yesterday I made Ashwin my captain in Dream 11 and today Marsh. Life is a misery.,22
Padikkal looks more promising than Pant for sure.,3

idk but it seems like he's faking xD,-3
You'd think there would be many more Indians in the cricket sub Reddit,3
Can we get Murli to bowl instead,4
My prediction for this match is that Dale Steyn will get injured (I hope he doesn't),0
I went to join a cricket team last year and I was so so nervous cause I just bowl pretty ordinary medium pace and I didn't know anyone on the team. I live in the UK and all the guys were from india. Anyway In my first net I bowled like a waist high no ball bordering on a beamer and one of the blokes just yells SIRAAAAJJJJ. Been friends ever since,5
These were sixes in Chinnaswamy. Padikkal robbed.,10

Only when you watch from 3D angle.",9
Shankar gave 10 runs off 1 ball,6
Just finish the fucking over u idiot.,3

The joke write itself,3

What has happened? RCB's supposed to be the meme,19
"To honor the name of 3d, he bowled 3 balls instead of 1 ball.",30
This SRH pace attack is very one dimensional. Similar pace bowlers. Rashid will have to carry them.,4
Shankar subbed in more than half way through Marsh's over and still nearly bowled a full over himself LMAO,26
3d players give you 3 extra bowls in an over.,4

Good ball,1
SRH playing like RCB. RCB's top order playing like SRH's. What timeline is this?,5
Shankar knew he wont get more than 2 overs so he made sure to get more in 1 over,9
Shankar thought it will be added to Marsh's figures,91
"can't wait for rayudu to come at 4 n get a 100, during RCB vs CSK only for the camera man to zoom in on Kohli everytime rayudu hits a boundary",2
Padikkal is making finch look like a debutante,8
VVS you're in the dugout not in commentary,13
Great yorker,2
So Padikal is naturally aggressive or more like aggressive accumulator?,3
Kayo down for anyone else?,3
Where is Parthiv? Disgrace he is not playing. They are behind where they would have been if he opened,-1
Looks in to me,1
Lovely shit,1
Okay now they'll send everything upstairs,1
How do you put this team badge in front of your name,2
Sandeep on pitches where the ball doesn't do much is utter useless,2

Wonderful stuff,0
Menon checking everything today,7
Absolutely brilliant,4
No offence but i just saw lord shankar in 3d,7
No Indian escorts for the players this year.,5
Sandeep always looks like he's going to fall over after his delivery stride.,5
cut him in between let VVS speak,5
both jerseys look so similar,5
Beautifully done,1
4d chess by Shankar making sure he never gets to bowl again and risk injury,6
Quit cutting him off slats you rude cunt,8
Shankar thought if he could sneak in 3 balls he could get an LBW,12
That was close lol,1

We needed that over. It slowed their pace down. Great job from Sandeep after that first over.,3

I want to see Abd and Virat but I don't want these two to get out.,4
Can we be done with the best bowling unit already? We stopped being a decent bowling unit after 2018. It's been 2 years.,7
3 good Yorkers in that over,3
They should have opened with phillipe and padikkal and played moeen or Morris at 6.,4
Young boy Rashid coming,6
How did he bowl the yorkers so well? I thought he was shit now,2
Maybe SRH will be forced to play Stanleke due to no Express Pace,4
I was missing that old man,1
It won't be a familiar territory for Kohli to walk in this late üòÇ,7
Now that the spinner is on turn up the stump mic I want some Bairstow nonsense,6
Rashid Khan hasn't aged a bit.,3

It will be tricky starting against Rashid for Kohli and AbD.,2
Rashid Khan turned 19 on his birthday .,8
Prawn on the barbie mate,3
Save us Rashid.,6
16 year old Rashid Khan is here,8
Man why I'm so scared of Rashid,6
U-19 youngster with the ball.,7
Rashid Khan has been 21 years for the past 30 years at least.,10
Ghanta catch,3
anything less than 180 after this start is going to be very disappointing for RCB,5
Altroz is Alto 2.0,2
Does Rashid Khan pick his own overs or does every team just always want to bring him on for over 7?,4
Young Rashid to Young Padikal,3
"Now is the real test for Padikkal, I believe. Even Parthiv used to get off to great starts in the powerplay last year. Whether Padikkal can capitalise on this start might be the difference between the two.",2
Rashid the infant to bowl,2
I hope padikkal can get a 50 would be a really impressive feat,2
"The advertising in the IPL always cracks me up, but hey if it works then they're clearly doing well!",4
"Rashid san, taskette...",3
thats one way to get a single,1

Lmao these hindi commentators are sooo biased,2
Fucking harrier mk2,1
Do we have too many short guys?,3
"Yes Slats, we're all buying cars in the middle of a global pandemic",9
Every ball of Rashid not played by Kohli and ABD is a liability to SRH... Oh God...,5
"Tata altroz being The Gold standard of cars :p
How much bribe have these commentators taken",7
"**Powerplay scores of 50+ without losing a wicket**

RCB in 2019 - 1

RCB in 2020 - 1",37
Better for SRH to keep Padikkal and Finch there tbh,2
Dean has shit choice in hatchbacks imo,6
Hey that's really awesome. Look forward to seeing you tmrw :),2
"If Rashid were Ashwin, he would have definitely mankaded Finch.",1
Gotta feel for the Harrier,3
"If padikkal starts like this,parthiv will be seen in the dugout commentary box before the playoffs.",8
Baby Padikkal should hit baby Rashid all over the ground,3
7 overs in and Kohli and AB haven't come out to bat yet? This must be a record for RCB,26
"Don‚Äôt wanna sound salty, but my man PP would have passed 50 already",3
Only Lord Umesh today?,3
Tfw it actually hits you that you're 2 years older than Rashid Khan.,6
Shivam dube should come in next and smack a few...,1
Fuck me how big are the boundaries. I'm not tuning into the IPL at 1am to watch 3 sixes per match,5
Who is better rashid or yuzi?,1
Nice over by Rashid as usual,1
Absolutely love the awkward advertising plugs from the commentators. Danny Morrison isn‚Äôt so bad at them but I can‚Äôt wait for Simon Doull to have to do some of the promos.,5
"All things considered, Rashid bowled a very decent first over.",3
First match and Moeen Ali is bored already.,6
I hope Steyn doesn't feature in memes.,1
Hitting Rashid with confidence is one thing!,6
Kohli: Only 250 more and maybe we can take this to the last over.,10
Finch looks all set for the next ashes,29
Koach is excited to bat. Raring to go. Raging bull.,3
This is where SRH is good. They don't lose their shit after few bad overs,2
[deleted],5
This is The Infinite Tsukuyomi.,2
Finch can take a risk in the next 3 overs with Virat and ab to come,1
"padikkal looks more promising than dubey tbh.
Footwork and batswing top notch for a youngster.",5
I actually like this rotation of strike. I don't really mind it. Much better than hitting mindless shots,3
"Tbf, the last time finch batted in the UAE it was a test match, poor guy is just confused.",2
These dream 11 ads don't make any sense. Nothing relates to fantasy cricket at all.,2
"I underdstand the commentators have to hype the prizes and all, but no one seriously believes that car is the gold standard of hatchbacks. RS3 and a45 amg are so much better.",6
"r/cricket and predicting the outcome of tournament by seeing 6 overs of game.

Name a more iconic duo.",11
We should always have Nabi on the other end of Rashid... He creates pressure... We are lost here with inexperienced bowlers...,1
"The city line looks Lit Af
Expect a lot of Non Mallus  also to go there soon",2
Has anyone here been to Dubai or Abu Dhabi? If so what's it like?,3
the sponsor names are so garbage. unacademy learn from the best,12
So sexed to see Padikkal. Cannot wait to see Gill and Padlikal bat together in blue!,6
The picture quality of this season is really good as there's very less pollution in Dubai,3

What's a par score on this pitch? 150/160?,2
Is it me or this guy looks like yuvraj lite?,1
Cringy boys dancing wtf happened to world,1
Finch needs to switch gears,2
"can't understand why Aussies say Finch is shit in tests, looks good to me",10
"He's got that 'lazy' yuvi swing, doesn't he?",9
Finch needs to move on,2
"Wow, Finch is not in touch today",2
Doing slightly better than when we played SRH [last time](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/scorecard/1175366/sunrisers-hyderabad-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-11th-match-indian-premier-league-2019).,3

Padikkal looking like the senior batsman,7
I don't even notice the fake noise anymore.,58
300+ score and they will surely win it.,5
Any danger of finch middling one,6
Finch need to get a move on now.,2
Sunny G might Fap to Paddikal if he stays for long,18
Someone watching cricket for the first time would think this is Finchs debut match and Padikkal as explosive opener.,14
Release the kanos,6
Aight Finch should be done with his senior citizen quota by now,3
Padikkal for Dhawan already or we have some more time to ponder?,2
Someone tell finch that this is not a ODI for ffs.,2
Morris is a must,1
"Arun Finch, gati badhao",2
This guy is the real deal!,4
Finch must be having 8 jerseys .,8
Ofc they bought Natarajan keeping in mind the slow wicket of Hyd. He bowls cutters they are saying.,5
2 lads from Malappuram in the IPL. big up KL10!,8
"Finch definitely needs to step it up, can afford to get out with Kohli and ABD to come.",4
Wow Finch has surely been awful.,0
Padikkal reminds me a lot of Yuvi for some reason,4
People already replacing dhawan here for padikkal. smh.,13
Hope RCB grooms this guy can be a good prospective.,6
If steyn's shoulder holds up this rcb bowling looks pretty good. of course it's a pretty big **IF**,5
Bring on Vijay Shankar please. Need some fireworks.,7
3 overs went quite,3
I don't think Finch needs to go just yet. Staying without loss after 10 overs will put RCB in a very good position.,6
God these jio ads are so lame,2
Finch doing his best impression of Dravid.,3
Good 2 overs after that nightmare of super overs,1
RCB should get 200 from here,2
Am I the only one okay with the fake noise? I mean it's better than no noise! They could work a bit with the timing tho.,7
Padikkal has some amazing sense of timing.,2
Why no strategic timeout? 8 overs done,1
Dammm that's some bat rotating by paddikal,7
Nice come back by SRH after that over by lord shankar,7
However much we score we have no ability to defend so nothing is safe here,4
I need my 3-D glasses... can't remember where I put em..,3
Finchy it wasn't a 5 match ODI series against England,6
"Hindi ads on sky sports

This is wild",9
Cheeky,2
And why would you do that,1
Ooh ballsy! I like it,3
Okay. It's time for Flinch to go ape shit.,3

Aaron finch looking pretty rusty,2
Finch ffs,1
Dravid Finch.,6
Haha! That's the highest I've seen Rashid feed flight to his ball.,2
As usual SRH middle over squeeze. Doesn't help if we don't take wickets.,2
No ads on Hotstar! Is it the end of capitalism finally!,3
Ipl has mid season transfer this year right ?,3
Notice how all RCB flairs in this thread are being fucking pessimistic(including me)? It's because we can at least say we called it.,11
Reverskyyy. Enter Russian Commentator,2
"Aight. Looks like 69-1 soon


Edit: Thanks Rashid",5
"If Devdutt stays in form 2-3 games in the tournament, playing Parthiv for Finch and Morris lower down will give them more balance.",-2
Why is everyone mocking vijay for 3D comment made by MSK?,7
Good hit,1
"11 runs off the last 2 overs is honestly quite terrible with 10 wickets in hand. You could lose the match with such fine margins in T20, there's actually zero reason for this slowdown.",3
"69


Nice.",4
Looks like Virat vs Rashid is not going to happen today :(,8
Slater leaves and Pietersen comes on. Dear lord,2
"Fuck this, I just want ab",2
Feels like a wicket is imminent. Both of them look fidgety,3
Finch is accelerating,7
Get out!,2
It's good that we have a senior and a rookie batting together. Finch must be feeling privileged to be batting with Paddikal,28
Rashid just gave Finch the much needed breathing space,3
never doubted you Aaron,5
Rashids age is his jersey number.,11
VK and ABD yet to come. This is RCB's game to lose.,8
"Ohh fuck, we r totally fucked today",8
Finch getting into action. Acclimatization all done.,7
Just returned. Rubs eyes,4
Has to get 200 after this start,8
"Aaron Finch, bloody good batsman. Probably the best hitter I know, certainly the best hitter he knows. T20I average of 38, so...",4

"When Finch smashes, it remains smashed",3
Have faith in big Finchy boi.,1

This is better than last years score so its a moral victory,20
"*Finch times 2 shots*

SRH: I'm in danger",16
RCB has the best start in the tournament already.,16
Prediction: RCB: 173/1,11
"Trying to watch in peace at work, the seccy just walked up and said '75 to nil, that's pretty good.' Fucking end me cunt",9
"Gotta love Finchy, very likeable cricketer / character",5
How can rashid bowling be so good yet so expensive rn,7
If even Rashid is getting hit we are comfortable worst bowling unit in IPL. There is just no wicket taking bowler there.,6
GET READY BOYS,6

RCB crossed 70 bois.,10

I was expecting him to start ahead of Josh today",1

Now : Never doubted you, Aaron",24
Finchy joining the party.,2
Eho is the second spinner for srh?,1
Sick a relief to have a batting pair to complement VK and AB,2
"Take it easy on Rashid, he just finished his test on the first 8 multiplications. He will be in the game soon..",8
"Rashid getting figured out, inexperienced middle order, and worn out pacers. It‚Äôs going to be a long season.",4
When was the last time 9 overs was bowled out with kohli yet to bat for rcb?,9
Arun Finch starting to pickup momentum.,6
I really want Josh to play good today. It feels good when new players perform well.,10

Is this the same pitch where DC KXIP played yesterday?,5
Have I missed Padikkal's induction into LONG LEVERS\^TM,6
I don't think RaKha is gonna be as effective earlier in the season but as wickets will get slower he'll come into play.,3
That Shankar economy though xD,5
Akshay Kumar and Amitabh B are selling 90% of all available products in market,10
"Loving the new logo, looks classy",1
Should Virat even come next if these two plays for another 5 overs?,1

3 overs of Shankar? Yes please.,8
That's a sick solo right there in the ipl theme lmao,1

Is that a sHoRt RuN?,2
Wasnt this Abhishek guy a pacer when he played for Delhi? Strange,5
[deleted],7
Don't expect the overrated AB to go anything. He is finished.,-12
All the players today are looking good and fit .,3
SRH throwing everything at them,2
So what happened to SRH bowling ?,1
Brilliant running from dev,5
"Have been working and will miss the game.


[... so I'm posting this NSFW Warner image early... Prepare your bodies](https://i.imgur.com/0TPLBLF.jpg)",6
Get your half century boy,1
Man tom Moody has gotten really old.,2
Sometimes i wonder if the commentators know if they on air.....,2
I am fascinated to see how we lose this from here,1
"Reminder:

Finch's T20 HS is 172",3
"Kohli is a Punjabi, he's from Delhi and plays for Bangalore

And Punjab, Delhi and Bangalore have never won an IPL Trophy",7
rashid and sandeep have the same number of dots,2
Abhishek using all of his 15 degrees.,3
Padikkal is winded already.,6
Will Finch Bowl,2
Was excited about koach milking doubles on these bigger grounds. I am not complaining.,2
50 for padikalllll.,2
Can someone please explain me the 3D shankar meme?,4
Fuck yeah,1
IPL fielding ‚Ñ¢,4
All this with ABD and Kohli yet to come.,3
Oh that's pretty poor from rashid,3
The scenes if Kohli and ABD are never required to bat this match!,8
My heart beat so fast that one moment lol,5
Rashid lmao,4
Rashid what are you doing,4
"Well when it's your day, it's your day. Dev babu üëèüëè",1
Jesus fuck what timeline am I living in?,2
Noooooooo,1
Oh that was way too close,1
Wtf! Why is he so far from the line?!,1
"Aight, it‚Äôs upto Bhuvi to do the work. He needs to ensure the death overs are controlled so we can reduce their score by 20 runs.",1
Bit of luck there but terrific innings from Paddikal.,1
Good going Devdutt,3
Rashid mispositioned,1
"Caught
.. Sleeping hahahah",2
LMAOOO,1
What a knock on dayboo,1
Abhishek looks like those chiseled American highschool drama leads,2
Fuck yeah! Let's go,3
When was the last time a player scored a 50 on debut?,2
Fuck rashid,1
That fielding is pretty close to what I see most Saturdays when I play,2
Rashid with exuberance of youth,1
The fielding has been BBL level this IPL,1
2020 is indeed weird Rashid Khan didn't catch it,1
"Well batted young man, top knock. Now get out please, I wanna see Koach bat.",-4
Padikal deserves a india call up,2
"Fifty on debut, wp devdutt living up to the hype",1
Hahaha.,1
Brilliant debut fifty for Padikkal. Can he get to his hundred? Do you want him to?,3
"Padikkal looks the real deal. What a confident, stylish 50 for a youngster on debut.",3
Sunrisers are like a pack cards there are 3 face cards rest are just numbers.,1
Wtf is that Fielding position.,4
Rashid fielded that like someone in his late 30‚Äôs. Oh wait.,6
at this point would you want AB or Kohli to come in next?,1
Rashid is rusty too :(,1
Get bhuvi back,1
E sala cup namade!!!!,5
"These two have done excellently to set a platform but you sort of feel that you waste the talent of Virat and AB if they only get <10 Overs.

Paddikal making me look silly though!",5
"I thought we only relied on foreign players for our batting but jfc, all the indian bowlers are trash too exception of bhuvi",3
BBL FIELDING,2
Does anyone have a stream please?,2
Rashid has always been a shitty fielder. Not sure what the comms are on.,-3
Fielding in this IPL is way below par,1
Looks like it will take time for fielding standards of players to get back up.,2
"Ah fuck man, we don't have chance tonight",3
Deccan Chargers flashbacks,3
The Prince Arrives.,2
"Wait, they are still batting?",4
I like this lad Pallikal. Nice swing of the bat,2
Half century fast,1
"Can some sweet soul share a link to a stream, I'm in the ER on pain meds so I'm kinda fucked up hehehe",3
Well his debut match 50's what he is known for.,7
This kid looks like a great prospect,2
Luck going towards rcb way yes this is 2020.,5
Fuck. I hope we aren't spending the rest of the season's luck rations today.,10
One youngster helping another youngster to reach his 50 on debut. Respec for Rashid,16
If the openers don't win it with 10 wickets then the match is good bye for srh,8
Rashid rushing in... eager to catch... misjudges it.,2
Definitely a Dev doot (God's messanger) for RCB,4
Did I just see Rashid misjudjing a catch? One of the best fielders in IPL.,1
"Smart from Warner tbh, first game of the tournament and he's getting a feel of all his bowling options and RCBs probably the best team to experiment against. You always gotta outmeme them to beat them.",5
"10 overs without loss and a score of 86.  A part timer still needs to cover 2 overs to make up for Mitchell Marsh.

Sometimes this sub can be too impatient to see what is being built.",3
"SRH next match lineup should be :

Warner (c) , Bairstow (wk), Pandey, Shankar, Sharma, Nabi, Garg, Khan, Bhuvneshwar, Kaul, Sandeep?",2
50 on debut. Pure class,13
This is one those alt timelines. Confirmed by Rashid.,7
"**Devdutt Padikkal on debut**

Ranji Trophy 7 & 77

Vijay Hazare 58

Syed Mushtaq Ali 53

IPL 52*",29
BBL levels of fielding,1
How did SRH go from the best bowling lineup in the IPL to this in 2 years?,6
180+ on the card?,2
"Hey RCB fans, a wicket here and you send AB, right?",2
"I have seen Rashid running forward and then jumping at the last moment and catch it to make it seem more impressive than it should have been. Well, the stunt cost him this time.",2
RCB will still lose lmao,1
I am aroused,4
"Just saying without context, does someone remember Paul valthaty",1
"WP on debut, DP",1
Paddu is playing a blinder. Meme team has finally found a good opener.,2
I may be mistaken but wasnt abishek sharma one of the 3 spotfixers for rr?,1
Excellent start,1
Is this the only Karnataka batsmen opening for RCB after Manish pandey after scoring that 1st 100 by indian in IPL against Deccan chargers or is it mayank Agarwal??,2
Can some one tell who will now Bowl Out VK & ABD,2
where were you when devdutt was padiKILL,9
3D is back,5
"RCB 86-0 after 10 with Virat, AB and Josh to come...Definitely 180+ on the cards?",3
Padikkal is a smart player,3
"two unsolved mysteries:
1-shankar in wc19
2-pawan Negi in rcb",5
Carnage 3.0 here it is,2
"Well, the good takeaway is that I had Padikkal in my fantasy. So that‚Äôs working out for me.",4
3d man here,2
Rcb giving srh the taste of their own opening batsman,8
Shankar bowling. Here comes few more extras.,3
"SRH? More like Deccan Charger!

Gottem!",4
Scenes if Shankar takes wicket this over,2
"RCB need to start going for it now. With this platform and Kohli and AB yet to bat, less than 200 would be underachieving",4
[deleted],10
"Bit uncharacteristic of Finch to go slow when there are no wickets down, can't see him doing this for Australia, as he does have Strike rate of 154 in t20Is.",3
It will be heartbreaking for RCB to loose after scoring 600 runs.,6
Village,3
RIP SRH,3
3D can't catch a break,2
Yay Vijay Shankar is coming to bowl,2
Thankyou SRH guys,4
Hahahahaha at srh fielding,3
Wonder how many times KP will say Bairstow should be in test squad if he scores above 30,3
3rd life,1
Pure comedy,2
IPL FIELDING,3
Shankar is back on the menu bois.,3
Lol. The wicket is lava,4
Ipl fielding,3
BIG BASH FIELDING,3

This is depressing now,1
Poor Shankar can‚Äôt catch a break:(,2
OMG! When it's your day nothing can go wrong.,2
Oh my fucking god this fielding,2
Lmao what the hell,1
RCB surely won't be able to retain Padikkal in the next big auction. I reckon he'll go to CSK,-1
LOL,1
Putting on my 3D glasses,1
Osho Rajneesh: What the fuck is going here!,1
"This is 2020, i won‚Äôt be surprised even if RCB qualifies to playoffs this time",3
SRH our brothers,2
Lol which one of them is RCB .,3
"okay imma be the first one to say it this sub!!!

Get ready for 3d experience,1
Jeez this is painful to see,1
The Gods are on our side.,4
"Alright, I think we safely throw the kitchen sink at everything from here on",3
Oh god what a joke,1
2020 huh,1
Village fielding,2
Bhenchod fuck this shit,2
Warner copying Captain Morgan,1
"What the fuck are hyderabad doing today?

You're in an empty stadium, there's no excuse for not calling got a catch and not hearing a call

Poor fielding",3
So it's gonna be that kind of day for SRH,3
No offense but this guys looked better than prithvi shaw from the word go.,-1
ü§°ü§°,2
If India don‚Äôt win the next 3 world cups and t20 wcs.. they have like 20 batsman u21 who are better than any other u21 player in the world,0
If RCB are not going to play Parthiv then I will demand a refund of my hotstar subscription. I demand to see the best players,0
"Two drops in last 6 balls, fuck out of here",3
Paddikal is on suicide mode.,2
Kane Williamson will throw a mutiny half way through the season.,5
Warner copying Captain Morgan,2
Only in 2020 can RCB have an opening stand like this.,5
Holy fuck that was about to become ugly.,2
Every team sucks at fielding now,2
Lord Shankar noooooo,3
3D can be India's CDG,3
Kohli and ABD finally getting run support.,4
Poor 3D Shankar,5
3D experience indeed,3
lmaooo,1
That was Allen's catch.,6
Devdutt scored 7 50s out of his 13 innings. Madness!,4
"Debut ranji 50
Debut vijay hazare 50
Debut IPL 50

This Padikkal kid is quite good.",12
The crowd noise stopped them from communicating,3
hahahahahahaha,6
How the shit can't they hear each other calling? No one is in the crowd,10
I thought these kind of catches are dropped Because of crowd noises and they can't hear each other.. but I was wrong..,2
"RCB losing no wickets in the first 10. 

Look what you have done 2020",14
What the actual fuck is going on. Meme fielding,6
Awful day for Shankar,1
The batsman are getting greedy I kinda feel it,1
What the hell is Rashid doing?!,1
Who all does SRH have in the coaching staff?,2
"RCB is in 11th over already without a losing wicket.

Welcome to 2020. Nothing is normal.",7
That's Allan's catch,8
Abhishek Barging in ..Yeh main Lungaa mai lungaa,3
[deleted],2
That on guy who didn‚Äôt even reacted look stoned lol,2
Nobody should be laughing at fielding clashes... Moises Henriques nearly died a few years back from one.,3
Are.. We.. The meme club now?,3
Hope Shankar and the others pull through. I feel they are getting back in their groove. Sure they have given away runs but they are still bowling well.,2
Abhishek had no chance of a catch there,1
Is it a new rule for Jersey designers to leave half of the back for ads?,1
Oh no not the tiktok dream 11 cringe,6
Cringe,3
Does anyone get irritated by the fan view ? Or am I the only misanthrope ?,1
Dipshits,1
Look at those dancing fools lol,3
What was he trying to do getting just one hand on the ball? It‚Äôs like he didn‚Äôt want the other guy to get a chance too.,3
2020 is so weird RCB will top the table this season,1
"Finch should target every ball now, so much batting to come.",3

Phewuck,1
"As someone replied to me, looks like we're splurging our 13 years of luck rations",3
WTF is that uncle on Champions fan screen doing?,1

Need to be scoring more quickly here,1
"Ffs, get out quick, I want to watch steyn bowl",2
That was Fabians catch. Why was the other guy cursing him out stupid. He‚Äôs lucky Fabian don‚Äôt understand Hindi,4
Why would people demean themselves on live TV by dancing like that?,4

SRH is looking more meme team than RCB today...,8
Lmao all that hype and we aren't gonna see Koach or ABD bat.,9

"I don't mind the crowd noise anyone, get these fan cams out of my sight",3
Wow this sunrises team sucks.,-1

Shankar I didn't expect this from you.,2

Good over by shankar tbh. Very surprising,1

I hate when this happens. And it happens all over the world in all formats. The out of form senior batsman making the in form youngster trying to take on every ball for a boundary because he is not being able to score briskly.,2

Where's Paritosh?,4
Real openers of RCB out in the middle now,19

"Pingo Pongo, KP is a drongo.",5
I am not sure why commentators are gushing about ABD and Koach scoring run a ball(/occasional twos). The pitch did not seem like something where par score is 160-170. I think RCB has deliberately decided to let them play till the death overs given their lack of confidence in the lower order and not because it is a sound strategy.,0

Dube is there for what?,1
"Bhuvi > boomrah.
Fight me",5
Shivam Dube will anyway give more than he scores.,4
Calm down guys phillie is an opening batsmen. Dube is the better choice.,-1
What does Stoinis eat how did he cleared this boundary so easily yesterday,5
[removed],2
Just wait till the later stages of the tournament when the Pitches will get slow AF and Max score will be 120,-1
They were 90 in 11 overs man. What a waste,2
Dube should just hit or get out cos he‚Äôs not a fast runner nor can he play innovative shots please don‚Äôt waste the balls,3
That fake sounds comes late at times but not the dj songs. They always play as soon as over complete,1
"Slow ball does the trick ..
Hope Umesh anna won't throw fiercely like maddog",6
wtf every single ad stars Akshay kumar,2
T Natarajan will be taken apart this over,1
Hit out or get out now,0
"As much as I make fun of the pie chuckers, they are the ones who got the wickets",5
Natarajan kinda reminds me of Mustafizur Rahman,2
This over is key. Target Natarajan,6
"How can you struggle to get to 160 after that start, there wasn't even a collapse or anything",1
"Should've sent Philipe ahead, Dube can neither hit nor get out, without wasting two overs",10
Not sure this is a good score so far for the kind of start they got.. Hopefully they maximise these 3 overs..,2
"They should've saved Natarajan for the last over, now it looks like 3D will bowl.",6
AB pls get 20+ runs this over,2
AB the true carry.,8
"Guys why are you panik, ab is still there",2
"""As straight as a rocket"". Okay Bangar. That's enough.",10
This ABCD guy is good,7
Highly doubt the ability of Rcb bowlers to defend anything below 160,11
Regulatory - Kohli didn't win the toss today as well,7
"I don't like this, give extra over to Bhuvi pls",5
We don't need this stupid chant music,1
Theres something so aesthetically pleasing about ABs batting.,6
I was promised Umesh as opener in 2020 IPL. Where is he?,5
Whats T in T Nat for?,1
Fun fact: Delhi released both AB and Davey.,6
fuck you hotstar . fuck you bcci. Why there is only annual subscription option and not monthly in Canada?,6
I never knew I missed AB's batting all these years,3
"ABD always gives his best against SRH

((sad cat thumbs-up.png))",6
Which team is Mustafizur at?,2
"What the IPL commentators should say: ""with that start and line up RCB is 40 short""

What the IPL commentators actually say: ""Kohli OMG, de Villiers OMG""",17
"Heard that AB has 17 MOMs out of the 33 matches RCB won, when he played.",6
Please ABD hit 6 sixes. Pls do the needful,4
Dube doing Dube things!,3
"""SRH weak bowling unit""

I do know there are 2 overs left though. So I'll try not to jinx",6
anti climatic shot by dubey,4
Fucking Dube,2
Keep dhube on the strike.,3
Okay wtf we are at 138-3 at 17.4 with that start?,11
Can we reach 160 pls,2
"Don't really understand Kohli's decision to select josh in the team and then send dube ahead of him, while dube is a allrounder josh is a specialist batsman who has proved himself in BBL already..if kohli had this dilemma already , he should have gone with Morris/Moeen by dropping josh ...it looks like RCB thinktank is not thinking really",13
"Natrajan is definitely not a long term solution, doesn't lookethat much skilled and doesn't have pace at all.",-1
Oh Indian Mustafizur,2
Dubeji Plss. Hit out or get out,7
"Dube, fuck you.",2
Yep it‚Äôs in the death overs and we got a 3(4) from six hitter dube,3
Dubey is imposter. Vote him out,15
Why is Jay Shah getting so much screen time?,4
Dube farming strike over the inexperienced Saffer at the other end,4
Fucking Dube better perform now or reactionary Kohli gonna drop him for five games.,8
don't take a single off the last ball,5
Oh fuck off Dubey,2
Oh for fucks sake,2
50 in last 2? Just as likely as RCB winning ipl2020,4
It's all about bowlers running in and bowling spin..,2
My 203/4 prediction is not looking so likely anymore.,6
Agent dube,7
I miss the old IPL trophy.,2
"Bhenchod Dube, took a single off the last ball.",3
Good keep ABD off the strike,3
Really good bowling by Natarajan,1
Amit Shah Jr sitting beside the coveted trophy is just ROFL,4
Dube scoring runs at the worst times,4
The original Mr 360 was KP,2
What does the team management knows that we dont know. We all know that Dube cant time a stroke to save his life and they still send him ahead of Phillipe.,3
Of course he takes another single to retain strike,1
Budget Stoinis milking the bowlers here,1
Yes Dube keep strike very nice mate,3
"This is what I stayed up for, a run a ball 6 from Dube",11
DUBEEEEEYYY!,2
Well bowled!,2
Again last ball single,4
"Dube feels a bit basic when he plays, I don't know what but something is missing.",3
Gube took a single on last ball,6
I like Natarajan's bowling. Hope he has a good season.,5
Dube you kept strike!,6
Decent game for Nattu. That first over ruined his figure.,3
"This is fine. When you have good bowlers like Siraj and Umesh in the team, you can always come back, RCB.",6
And I here thought I will be not get angry watching RCB play.,4
?!#+#&@  ?????????,1
Wtf? Why are they licking a donkey?,3
200 eh boys?,2
Dube is padding his stats,1
That upGrad ad is fucking disgusting,3
Dubey is kinda sus,2
Pls Dube do not hog the strike at least. Better just cunt the ball as hard as you can,6
RCB doesn‚Äôt seem to have the batting depth they used to have previous seasons .,1
When Gone like a tracer bullet sounds better. Smh. Where's Harsha and that Australian woman,9
"Dube, stop giving a fuck about your place in the side and just play selfless for fuck sake!!!",4
These pitches are horrible. Par score should be 180,1
Dube is acting sus.,1
Doesn't SRH have another lefty quick?,1
Please get AB on strike,3
"Kab khoon khaulega tera, dubey ??",3
Natarajan had a bad first over but after that he has been pretty good. Really good in fact. Nailing those yorkers and being economical.,6
Now I feel the sound engineers are doing more work than the batsmen in the middle..,3
last ball single lmao. gully cricket ptsd,9
Dube is not only batting like shit but also taking strike away from AB,5
Dube needs to go.,3
"Fuck dube

Bring in lord umesh.  Remember his test knock.",11
"Dube hit or get out, that‚Äôs your role bud",6
Can't believe rcb will put up just 160 after being 89-0 midway,3
Dube get out already,5
Dube chutiya,3
Need to make at least 40 in the last 2 overs.,1
Watch AB butcher Sandeep.,2
It's better to take a pure batsman/bowler than someone who's shitty at both,0
Dube please get out bro,8
"Dube is so useless man, why not send Phillipe",4
ABD doesn't want to face Sandeep Sharma?,2
So dube is the death over specialist for SRH then.,4
Can they chill with the ABD chant geez,4
‚ÄúIdeally you want de Villiers on strike‚Äù no shit,6
Sandeep should be smashed for atleast 20 here,1
"Dube, why don't you get on all fours and start crawling between the wickets.",4
Shambolic from Dubey,1
We were at 90 in 11 overs for fuck's sake,3
"Good bowling sandeep,comen on boy.",1
singles Dube,1
Isn't Dubey also explosive? I faintly remember him being called a explosive batsman,1
"Expectation: Qts in the crowd  


Reality: Jay Shah",7
Need to get atleast 170. Dew will make things harder.,1
Why tf didn't AB keep strike,1
"Look at my boi Jay shah, who worked so hard to be in the position.",8
Massive!!!,2
wow,3
Yeeet,3
That was a stunning backfoot six!!!,2
Dube switching strike like a number 11 eh,3
Whyd they even get Phillipe if they're just gonna send dube ahead,2
this is shit,2
The old man is doing a service to the humanity. Covering his mouth but keeping his nose wide open.,7
ABD...........THE MAN !!!,5
You won't fool AB twice with the knuckle ball lmao,7
Aahhhh fuuukkk,3
noicee,3
"1st time watching the IPL {mods, there should be a flair for this!} What am I missing?

He's batted like shit.",1
"How tf do these people even perform after being out for so long?

Mad talent",8
"SRH always get better performance out from their Indian pace bowlers which most other teams struggle, something good about their management.",3
My god! you freak,3
6 again!!!!,3
200 6s for RCB. Damn.,2
"RCB started so good but still in same condition as other teams in matches so far were at...

Thanks for that 6 AB.",3
In ABD we trust,7
It's so satisfying to see knuckle balls get smashed.,4
Amazing stuff from AB this!,3
FTS,2
ABD on üî•,3
"Eng vs AUS - sony camera
Ipl- oppo camera . Come on star sports",1
We are going to get smashed these next 9 balls,1
Need atleast 4 more,1
166666,3
What a ridiculous player,4
"Bc what u dng. Keep the ball low, bowl slow balls",1
Where them yorkers at my boi,1
That's 200th six for AB De Villiers for RCB,9
Chut Dube,2
Bangar pretending to be a hype commentator is cringing the fuck out of me.,5
The lack of Joshua fills me with rage,2
In two balls the momentum is changed,3
When will the management learn not to trust Sandeep!!,1
ye toh hone hi tha....,2
No no it‚Äôs going over,3
ABD at his best.,7
"AB good

That's a brilliant shot",13
Dubey is hyped as discount Yuvi but he plays like he is not even discount Rajat Bhatia,12
ABD is the Iron man of RCB,8
Who is jay shah and what is the meme.,-1
Ab take the single,2
AB and Big Stoin the only ones that don't find these boundaries too big because they don't play on postage stamps all the time.,13
Love me some AB sixers,7
So casual ffs,2
Fuck that's a crazy shot,2
"Bc you don't bowl 145 ,don't try bouncers after that guy hit biggest six.",2
"Dube really is one trick pony, lmao",4
FUCKING FINALLY,2
6 or 1,1
170+ I guess,1
jay shah looks exactly like you would imagine,3
yesss. Imma chant that ABD too,2
Sandeeps bowling action is a bit of a whacky waving inflatable man,2
The man is a fucking freak,6
"Relieved hearing ""unacademy cracking six"" for once",3
Good work .,2
"\*No fielder even in sight\*

Commentator: Will that go to hand?",9
Yes ABD on strike again,7
ABD showing how much he missed cricket all this while.,6
Can anyone tell me what an unacademy six is yet??,3
Bhuvi slower balls plz,2
"1. Will Virat Kohli open the batting for Bangalore? No ‚úì

5. How many runs will team batting 1st score? 150 or more ‚úì",4
A B Delivered,3
On the bright side I‚Äôm glad Sandeep can pull off yorkers at a more accurate rate now.,3
Dubey 7(7) ..has he come to rotate strike on 17th over ?,4
AB just keep the strike. Treat Dube like Dhoni with Rayudu.,3
"Boobie, don't be dense and bowl Yorker length to AB!",4
Idk why we play dube in the Indian team,2
Rcb have done well to get to 160 after that terrible start,3
165-170 will be a good score.,3
Final Over Predictions? mine - 14,1
Even 175 is disappointing considering rcb at 10 over mark,2
Another 30 run over plxxxx,2
"Bhuvi, please don't break my heart, thanks.",2
This is like last year.,2
"Personally think the crowd noise is done pretty well for the most part.

Those individual chants though.. are creepy as fuck.",7
[removed],3
trust in Boobie,1
I think we all need to guard our girlfriends from Shivam Dube,2
"**Most Sixes for IPL team**

Gayle (RCB): 239

**ABD (RCB): 200**

Kohli (RCB): 190

Dhoni (CSK): 179

Pollard (MI): 177

Raina (CSK): 171

Rohit (MI): 143",11
170 is what I predicted earlier. I expect us to reach that. Let's see,3
BBL legends AB and Stoin playing well.,3
Well staying up to watch Philippe bat was a total waste of time. Guess I'll have to settle for watching him look average with the gloves,9
Bhuvi I love you but you gotta get wrecked now,3
Pls don't hurt Bhuvi AB plz,3
Bhuvi! Bhuvi! Bhuvi!,2
Dube owes us 10 extra runs,2
My man,1
All faith is bhuvi,2
Final over: Boobie vs AB.,3
"Chants of ""EEH, Beeh, Deeh, EEH, Beeh, Deeh"" rises in the stadium as the camera pans out to show the empty seats. Poetic, that scene. Might nominate for an oscar later.",9
Noiceee,1
"Wow, barely missed that yorker!",1
"ABD IS LOVE

ABD IS LIFE",1
no mid off mid on ???,2
Even after playing so less these last few years for abd his timing is still sweet.,2
He dug out that well.,1
"Ah, the customary 20 run Bhuvi over",1
AB will destroy Bhuvi this over like he did at wankhede,1
"Another incredible shot

Wasn't much wrong with that ball imo",4
That was kinda in a slot?,1
Cant bowl better than that. Very good batting.,3
Holy shit im gonna cum,8
Dada howww,2
"That‚Äôs a good ball tbh, ab just played it better",3
Wasn't a bad ball buts it's abd,2
ABD is kinda good tho. 7/10,2
Boobie is kill,2
I don't think the pitch is difficult to bat. I think they are still massively short,3
50 for ABD!,1
"170+ can be competitive, if RCB pacers don't mess up",4
Unleash them scoops now,3
Abd is so good üî•,2
AB the madman,5
watta playa,1
Boobie vs Ab,2
RCB pays 17 crore to Koach every year just so he can be a cheerleader for AB de Villiers,13
"""Bhubaneswar Kumar looking for that hole""",2
Koach fan boy moment. Cute.,9
He accelerates flawlessly in the death overs every single time...just extraordinary.,3
Get this 7 (7) fucker out of here,9
That Kohli O face when he saw AB swing that big bat of his.,5
Bhuvi bowling figures will take a hit by Abd,1
Oh AB! I've missed you so much!,3
This man is carrying the franchise on his back,10
No no no no no !!!!,8
Out out out pls,4
Pandey Ji with a nice throw,2
"I never really followed the IPL but I‚Äôve just finished college for the day and decided to put it on, and my god I don‚Äôt regret it. ABD is ace!!!",12
AB better come for the whole BBL this time. None of this half a tournament shit,14
Joshua time,9
Hes gone,3
Dubey forced Abd to do it.,8
Run out :/,1
Shit,1
YJB,2
Seeing AB hit Bhuvi is like happily sad personified,1
Who takes riks against Pandey the specialist fielder,2
No no no no,1
SPECIALIST FIELDER,5
"Brilliant from Pandey

He's one of India's best fielders and that's why

Good take from YJB",6
Manish is a gun fielder,4
Pandey is gun fielder ..imagine him at cover with jadeja at point,2
Great dive that from AB! Shows the commitment!,1
Is it safe to unclench my asshole?,6
[removed],2
Party is over lads,3
"That was a good yorker, plonked back over bowler's head. ABD is God tier.",3
Boobie please drop one Yorker,1
No trust in dubey I see,3
Pandey is a damn good fielder.,4
[deleted],-3
phillippe cameo time,2
Well played Abraham,4
I LOVE BOOBIE!,1
Out bc hahaha. Thank god. I'll be good from today if we win this Match,0
Fuck off Manish pandey.,4
I blame this on Dube,7
Nakkan,2
AB doing his best to keep Dube off strike üòÇ,11
That slow motion was so good,2
Philippe to finally bat...for 3 balls,4
"**19.3** Kumar to de Villiers, 1 run, OUT,  **162-4**

AB de Villiers run out (Pandey/&dagger;Bairstow) 51 (30b 4x4 2x6) SR: 170.00",0
*Bhuneshwar kumar looking for that hole*üò´,7
Manish Anna the Lord and saviour,3
Good guy De Villiers keeping Dube off strike,1
Manish Pandey with the laser throw. Ffs we need this guy in ODI‚Äôs too. This guy should have been our number 4.,2
Shankar and Dube are wonderful meme players.,5
Philippe 8(3),1
Fun fact: Pandey has the highest score in yoyo test for India,10
"AB, it might be time to shave your head buddy

Not a great look",1
Fitness and commitment from AB though with that diving second run. For his age as well. Amazing.,6
Great work from Bairstow,5
GREAT KEEPING WORK BY JONNY BAIRSTOW GREAT WICKETKEEPER,8
Great cricket from both abd and Pandey.,4
Boobie wins. Boobies always win.,4
I hope Koach absolutely lays into Dube. He needs a proper rollicking,4
I expect 'smart' RCB think-tank to send in Washington Sundar now,6
I will be highly disappointed if Joshua doesn't bring out the Paddle now,2
Can dube just take some responsibility instead of switching the strike like number 11,6
Manish 'Rocket arm' Pandey,8
Party time is over.,1
Hopefully Bhuvi bowls 6 no balls to give Josh a bit of a bat,8
You're 3 down and you have to come back for a suicide 2 because Dube cant get one off the square. Both Phillipe and Moeen would have been a better option. The latter would have either gotten out first ball or hit 48 off about 3 balls,4
Is Kane Williamson not playing this year?,1
Lmfao who's this,3
What a throw Pandey,1
Watch philipe sucking boobies,6
That was in the slot too,2
S P E C I A L I S T FIELDER,10
I guess this is the last time dube gets promoted ahead of phillipe,4
Short at least by 15,2
Gun throw that,5
Dube is the imposter.,25
Who dis PhilliPe guy,2
[removed],8
So 165 is the target.,1
"I don't know how Virat Kohli think sometime. There was no point of sending dube.  If Dube wasn't in that side , Abd wouldn't have taken this risk.",5
Budget Smudge,3
Bhuvi still has really good figures :-),4
"Unfortunate circumstances for Joshua ""steve Smith"" philippe",7
Excited to watch Warner vs Steyn,7
"Philippe, don't swing your bat like that. Not everyone is Bumrah.",7
That was a wide if left,2
Lmao Warner was voted 27% in more complete batsman,4
"**50+ scores for ABD vs SRH**

89 (2014) - Won 

82 (2016) - Won

69 (2018) - Won

51 (Today) - ???",11
Shivam cube about fo smash it,2
Good over till now boobie,2
Dube gonna defend now,1
Now dube will take a 4 and cement his spot in the team for next 5 years,3
Fabulous 1* on debut.,2
"If he can't use those big levers to hit a six now, idek what's the point",1
10 rupay ki bet Koach will drop Phillipe because he didnt hit sixes in those 2 balls.,6
41% choose ABD over Warner and Kohli,5
I rate Warner higher than kohli in T20's.,6
"Boobie's gonna try his yorker now.

Edit - Dang. He went for the opposite. Bouncer.",2
Fuck Dube all my homies hate Dube,6
Warner averages 43 in IPL,4
Dube SR > Phillipe SR lol,1
"After all this, they got only 6 more runs than DC and KXIP yesterday.",5
Bhuvi > Bumrah,6
Good job boobie,3
How long is the innings break ?,1
Hahahahahajahahahahahahah,2
Bairstow doing MS,4
What do you do Dube,2
Fuck u dube,3
Why wasn‚Äôt that a wide???,5
Can‚Äôt even score 30 off the last over. Noobs,12
Dube mate what did you even do,2
Dube pls,1
Bhuvi bowled really well today.,3
Lol Bairstow,9
"Ive seen the memes, but the crowd noise really is helping",8
"Lmao, wtf is Dube doing?",7
Shivam shit dube,5
Well over to you RCB bowling.,4
Ended it with classic RCB style,9
Kohli getting tips off Mo,2
So is that a run out or a stumping...,11
"What a lazy fuck, atleast try to save your wicket.",3
Hmmm what was that Shivam?,3
What a fucking idiot,2
Lmao Cube just gave up,4
Damn that was a sad ending.,1
"That's a good death over from Bhuvi

Only 7 from it

Also ahahaha Phillipe mugged Dube off there completely",1
Lmao at the ending,1
Lmao piss poor effort by Shivam dube. Sucks ass.,3
This guy doesn't like to play is it?,2
The fuck was that last ball?,8
Village boy dubey,2
Lol what was that,2
Dube you're a twat.,2
"That was meh!!

Let's see if bowlers can do anything.",3
RIP dube's average,8
Lol what was that run out,3
Absolutely useless Dube,5
Gazab bezati hai.,3
Pandey is the best outfielder in India.,4
Would've taken this after ten overs honestly. Good job by the bowlers especially when rashid went wicketless and marsh was injured.,3
"G U B E

U

B

E",6
wat,1
What the hell was that innings by dube,3
15 runs in the death overs by Bhuvi.,6
Thanks Dube,3
Dube is like a fish out of water,2
That was a wide,2
162 after that start? Yesterday teams got 157 from 16-3 and 55-5. Well done SRH,10
15 short from where they should have ended,2
Wtf? I feel bad for the guy now,1
"Pretty weak score, especially with so many wickets in hand at the end.

Should be chased down but we'll see I suppose.",12
That was a good joke on the last ball.,14
Atleast RCB stayed true to themselves and finished like a meme.,16
Dube is a total meme,8
I feel second hand embarrassment for RCB watching dube,11
Absolute circus that last ball,5
"**19.6** Kumar to Dube, OUT, **Bairstow runs at the stumps and finishes the run-out.** **163-5**

Why isn't zampa playing? Is he injured or something?,1
"Dude! Someone called a Dubey 7(9)
Close enough. Good one bro",6
Fuck off Dube,3
Dube motm for srh,8
Absolute amateur cricket. At least decide beforehand that you are going to run no matter what.,6
JONNY BAIRSTOW GREAT KEEPER DHONI WOULDN'T DO THAT,10
"Excellent, didn't deserve to remain not out",10
Fuckin Dube.,1
"Lol shiva dube n shankar

Shame to the holy name",7
Good over by Bhuvi.,2
Srh pulled it back pretty good,5
"Dale has had terrific records against Warner in the past. But boy oh boy, this is IPL Warner",7
Wah bairstow wah,3
Vintage SRH bowling only Muzzi missing :(,3
Congratulations SRH for winning their first game.,3
Dube's level is mumbai club T20 and shouldn't have picked him because he performed there,8
Dharavi ka hardick pandya,8
Atleast Bairstow got 12 points in D11. Thanks dube,4
Yes rcb,1
Big ground exposing the batsmen who rely on small boundaries.,4
What happens to bhuvi in blue jersey?,1
This isn't such a bad bowling effort from SRH.,4
why does phillips remind me of smith?,2
I thought they will get to 180 something. Not too bad.,4
"Shivam ""Santner"" Dube",2
"RCB coach after yesterday's match: Team, we should not let that happen in our innings.

RCB: Proceeds to accomplish exact opposite.",5
We suck at chasing 150+ scores. Hopefully a 50 from one of the openers and a sensible innings from Pandey.,5
"Zero intent from Dube, wow. Like, even if it's the last ball and it doesn't mean anything, you can try to save your wicket. No way any selector or scout is gonna look at this and think he's a good prospect.",3
Zero intent from Dube. Wtf was that,6
"You lot are too harsh

Not every player will perform every game

Pretty much everyone has days where they can barely time anything

+they've all (Indian domestic players) had a long layoff from competitive cricket ffs",0
Ian bishop's commentary is annoying yet calming at the same time,3
So Kohli had Phillippe in his team just because he doesn't want PP to bat down the order and AB doesn't want to keep because of his back issue. Smh,5
The AB run out saved 10 runs.,23
Phillipe be like fuck no dude I am not fking up my average,11
Disappointing end after a promising start but that‚Äôs just the story of RCB in general,9
"What's the point of using an overseas option as keeper if they gonna play him lower down the order, They should replace Phillipe with Parthiv and get Morris as the allrounder on whom they spend 10 crores.",7
A very patient and near perfect innings from dube. I think it's a game changer.,6
Doobie< Boobie,13
"Wow, it was like 4 wickets and you're into RCB's tail",9
"Royal Challengers Bangalore huh? Well, monarchies are an antiquated form of ruling of whom members of the ruling class have a parasitical control over society which they earned through undemocratic means so I support these RCB fellas in their quest for justice",16
Lube showed no intent,11
Man even Kohli was struggling to score on that track.  Finch couldn't get going even after playing in the powerplay. Everybody just likes to hate on fringe players like Shankar and Dube.,11
How long will this Dubeji fool people in believing he can play cricket,18
Foakes would‚Äôve run out both batsmen,33
"160+ is really disappointing considering they were 90 in 11 overs. 


And that's kinda the problem with batters taking their sweet time settling in.",14
Bhuvi did really well.,11
"Bhuvi with an amazing spell!! The Manish Pandey throw helped a lot, but bowling 4 pressure overs for 25 is amazing !!",11
"We pulled it back fairly well I guess. Alright, but not as good as a couple of years ago",6
"Wow, the comments are showing no mercy for Dube üòÇüòÇ",8
So does that count as a stumping or a runout? If anyone can explain with the official rules would be much appreciated,6
Bhuvi is such an underrated bowler.  Intelligent bowler who does whatever job you ask him to do. Keeps it tight and is reliable. Even in Tests he is useful and takes wickets with his probing bowling.,17
While the score is pretty high remember that RCB also has pie chuckers like we do,9
Fuckkkkkk I forgot RCB are playing today. Missed ABD :(,12
"RCB need a name change ffs , after 2 -3 players no one has a clue about doing anything nearly Challenging .",8
60 runs from Umesh‚Äôs 4 overs. Remaining 104 from 16 with a non-existent middle order would be fun to watch,14
Bhuvi for Test team?,4
Looking forward to a bit of YJB not gonna lie,11

Dube is a such a nice guy. He voted himself out.,12
163 is a good score provided Steyn strikes early,6
More effort to score from Philippe's 2 balls than Dube's 8,5
"I would add 15 runs to this score, the ball does not travel as fast as in grounds in other countries.",2
Manish Pandey is a gun fielder. Hope his batting also gets better.,9
We saw ~100 runs in the 2nd half by all 4 teams the past 2 days. This was a below par finish save for AB.,2
"The problem wasn't Dube failing, anyone can the main issue is showing no intent or understanding of his role. He wasn't even trying to slog or score boundaries.",11
This dube is the 6th bowler for RCB today lol,5
"Hope Ed Smith is watching, reading YJB for his return to the test side",4
Srh winning in18.5 overs?,3
Amazing Bhuvi,6
How is that so many cricketers speak in the same exact way?,3
Umesh and Steyn show coming up boys! üòé,4
Just wanna see Umess conced 80 runs in 4 overs,22
163 isn't a bad score. Remember RCB have Styn gun,3
"Lol 77 of last 10 overs with 10 wickets in hand and opposition 1 bowler short

Classic Rcb thank u for nostalgia",14
Paddikal could be good prospect for opening in place of Shikhar Dhawan when Dhawan retires.,12
"RCB finally had a good finisher in Mo and they drop him, along with Parthiv who looked more impressive than kohli himself last year. 
  
There's barely any stability in their batting lineup",13
"Can anyone explain why Josh fucking Philipe is playing ahead of Chris Morris especially when AB was said to have been preparing for keeping wickets?

Kohli back with the Random Team Generator?",16
"Man give somw credit to the bowlers too instead of just blaming dube, even abd and kohli found it hard to get going for the most part.",11

I can literally hear Kohli saying we were 15-20 runs short in the post match interview.,21
Padikkal has good vibes.,4
RCB to abduct Jofra and put a Umesh mask on him to bowl to Davey,4
Shami>bhuvi>bumrah,7
"Finch 29(27) and Kohli 14(13) really slowed RCB down, they were probably being overcautious. An explosive hitter like Moeen or Chris Morris could have been really handy for RCB today, do they have any keeping option besides Phillipe? He is another top order batsman who needs time to get going like Finch/Kohli but not on the same level either.",5
LOL Dube ..man seriously tried to get a single at the last ball,4
Unpopular opinion: It wasn't as great a position at the half-way stage as we're led to believe. Having all 10 wickets in hand isn't a big advantage over having 8 wickets and 8.6 RPO isn't exactly a flyer.,5

Why doesn‚Äôt SRH take Williamson? They need someone in the middle order,1
At least one Pant is playing well,3
Haven't seen the first innings but de Villiers is still absolutely class isn't he,7
The only way Dube can play well is if he gets bought by some other team.,5
" ""Walking like a Dube, feeling all cool, you've got the look, you're gonna rule,"" Kohli says at the start of the jingle as he smoulders down the lens of the camera.

 He then turns to Pant to say: ""Hey man, you're all set for tonight"".

Pant then launches into his own trainwreck ditty.

""Paint the town red 'cos Virat says so,"" Pant says before he's cut-off by some words of wisdom from his skipper.

""But before you step out, dear bro, that Dubes gotta go.""",12

Did anyone notice ring on kohli's finger? Are rings allowed?,1
"Definitely not the English player we were expecting to get Warner out, but yet again and English player takes his wicket",5
The only thing I want from RCB is for Morris to call someone a BC when he takes a wicket.,8
Koach you're going to be a dad in a few weeks. Why are you so angry the whole time?,12
Steyn looks so different,3
Manish Irritating Pandey is here guys. Every SRH fan remembers how many matches he bottled for us singlehandedly.,4
Steyn still bowling 145ks not bad,5
Is srh more reliant on warner or India on kohli.,3

That's some hourse shit bowling by RCB,-2
Steyn hitting 145 kmph!,6
Why are we not playing Morris again ?,1
Well YJB has just made it much easier to support SRH as an Englishman,4
May just be the hair but Steyn doesn't look a day older than when he was  bowling for Deccan Chargers.,11
Here we go again Classic SRH batting is back lol,6

No offence to steyn but he can't carry that head band like Curran or dinda used to do,11
Panty getting beaten for pace.,2
Shot by Pandey ji,1
tfw when your fantasy captain gets run out like that.fuck imma just gonna go and cry in the corner,3
"To everyone shitting on Pandey, he's a beast when he bats at 3, watch him play a crucial innings.",3
Overseas selection is again a problem for kohli. Cannot drop of finch at opening because of his form so you can play PP as a wk. So kohli will have to play Philippe. If he wants morris in then steyn has to go which damages rcbs death overs. Zampa and chahal are interchangeable but doubt chahal will be dropped. Ali is flexible in batting positions but no way he gets into this team.,7
Keep ‚Äòem coming boys,1
Good shot pandey Garu. Keep hitting in the power Play.,3
Dough Bollinger was bald at like 22,2
"One more wicket, and we can take it to the death overs before we choke, c'mon RCB.",12
Steyn is perfect replacement for Daniel Craig in bond films,10
That headband keeps giving me Dinda vibes even when Steyn is wearing it,12
"Had it with stupid baseless forwards on WhatsApp lmao

My parents have gotten forwards in group chats about how London's supposedly in lockdown again - we live here lads, I think we'd know",3
Comms praising Bairstow even when Pandey was the one who hit it,3
Bairstow and Warner together could have top devdutt and Finch but Bairstow wants it's all,3
This is kind of score which Manish can chase it down,2
If kohli gets corona then his one 'behenchod' can infect every person in the stadium.,8
"C'mon Koka-Kohli, chuck the ball to Finchy, trust your base instincts",5
"Poor gesture from Umesh. Should have warned Warner at least once, not to leave his crease until the ball has crossed the length of the pitch after being hit. Bad sportsmanship.",4
SRH's batting is too weak without Kane #bringbackKane,5
Kohli‚Äôs problems with getting the tail out continue,10
"As an Indian fan, I hate to see Pandey at 3. We need to groom him as a finisher for world t20.",3
"Tbh might be just a masochist. But i love the feeling that we've lost the game as soon as one of the openers gets out to a low score. 

Makes every win we get after 2 wickets down feel like an upset win.",9

"Man chahal is such a delicate guy, what is he doing after stopping the ball",4
Hope Saini gives me my 150 kmph orgasm soon,4
Yuzi limping? Is he okay?,2
Now Chahal injured,2
Steyn looks like that tennis player whose name eludes me at the moment,1
Chahal could make a lot of impact here since grounds are bigger,3
Don't tell me yuzi is injured,2
Steyn rocking the Bjorn Borg look,4
Another injury? Are these stadiums built on ancient burial grounds or some shit? Cursed,14
Pandey is criminally underrated,9
Why was Kohli mouthing BC? As if umesh yorked warner. It was pure luck.,15
"Yuzi just get something to eat getting injured for stopping a ball, jeez.",5
The first match is usually the last time you see kohli smile,21
[deleted],18
Another injury wtf,3
"i swear steyn had a pretty standard haircut when we played south africa in like february, how has he grown a full mullet in 6 months",1
Every match someone gets injured. That‚Äôs the sacrifice the UAE god demands.,18
Is this the 4th injury of this IPL,3
What the hell is that music bruh,5
Its time for Chahal now,3
MediBuddy has got to be the worst name for an app from the Indian startup ecosystem.,6
"Saini üî•

Injury premier league 2020 confirmed,3
this is actually a really good opportunity for Pandey. Hope he doesn't bottle it,5
"Kohli remembered he left the oven on, hence the bhenchod",10
I swear there is an injury every inning,6
pls god no,6
"Tbh I think Kane is needed, today's bowling just shows that we don't really need an overseas all rounder.",7

Will bairstow get out bowled? Yes,3
Saini !!!!,1
WHAT THE FUCK WHAT HAPPENED TO CHAHAL,4
Saini looking good today,1
I love watching Saini and Prasidh Krishna bowl. Rrraaapid!,3
Any update on Marsh?,1
Manish never looks settled even if he plays 100 balls,4
Koach giving a batsman a send off after they got run out due to pure bad luck is not necessary imo,12
146 kph,2
Looks like Bairstow was damn interested when he saw Jofra Broad and Xbox banter for Warner's dismissal,3
"Lord Umesh stopped after 1 over

Koach saving him for death",13
are rcb gonna use home and away jerseys this season?,3
Kaiku re utha speed daal rh h,6
So the new branding is Injury Premier League?,6
Cut him in fucking half,4
Go 150 saini,7
Saini looks like MJ in the Thriller video,3
146!,5
SRH is just RCB but  choking their way to the playoffs,40
"I love Saini. 146kph. Go fast, go fast.",9
Saini might break a stump here,6
"After the end of the ipl, pujara will be the only player not injured and he single handedly bat bowl and field and get us the Australian win",47
Same scores but just 1 wicket down at this stage,5
The grounds are harder here or something?,3
Siraj looking like Dhongi Baba lol,2
Can already see how this match is going to go. Bairstow will singlehandedly keep us on track with the asking rate while other around him just suck up deliveries. Then he'll eventually get out and we'll crumble and fall well short of the target.,8
"Can bairstow get bowled already, I want to go to sleep comfortable with the knowledge that SRH tail can‚Äôt score the rest of the runs",12
Guys any alternative app in India to stream IPL apart from Hotstar?,3
Last time Warner got run out in IPL was back pre-Covid era in 2015.,10
Saini needs to bend his back a little more,8
"Oh no, siraj is speaking to steyn.",17
Anyone got a good pic of Dale's rockstar cut?,6
What's the this is not club cricket meme? I'm out of the loop,4
We just need Umesh to go and talk to Saini and remind him that he is playing for RCB.,5
"So far 3 matches in the IPL 2020 and all 3 had consecutive wickets fall in batting first innings :

Match 1 (MI vs CSK) -  Saurabh Tiwary and Hardik Pandya (MI)

Match 2 (DC vs KXIP) -  Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer (DC)

Match 3 (RCB vs SRH) -  Devdutt Padikkal and Aaron Finch (RCB)",10
RCB is just a DP World!check their jersey backside,5
Should've picked Zampa instead of Phillipe. Zampa is clutch in T20.,6

Great from brillaint bairstow,1
Saini bowls way too much fast for his simple bowling action.,4

Being back Umesh!,1
Is Williamson not playing today?,0
I absolutely love the dugout. Can't ever go back to the regular commentary,1
Beautiful,1
What sublime timing that.,1
Umesh can get fucked,2
Lord Umesh whyyyy,2
[After Warner anna got out](https://youtu.be/rvr3DEjPMhA),5
Lord Siraj learning from Steyn üòç,3
Is Nehra still in Rcb.. missing him advising  bowlers from the boundary... didn't prevent them from getting carted though,4
Bairstow should do smt similar to what mayank did yesterday. Start off as an anchor and let go and start jamming towards the end. Easier said than done ofc,3
Shot,1
Neva had a doubt on you ......... Umesh......,7
"Umesh Dinda, keep bowling those areas",3
"Smooth shot, beautiful timing pandey garu",3
"New season, same Umesh

Nice floating half volleys on the pad.",7
I would be so glad to be part of Ambani family.,2
Yadav.. for fucks sake bowl off side,1
Who is RCB's bowling coach? Seriously.,1
Umesh Yadav for the 50,8
He is bowling trash here! Everything on leg!,3
you're not bowling to a left-hander ffs,1
Pandey you Beauty,6
is there any insect enthusiast that can share the [redacted] to watch,1
Wrist trouble,1

Last 2 matches were crackers. This one is going to be a cake walk for srh.,2
Can‚Äôt believe RCB only got 163,6
Pandey out scoring bairstow. Take that all you naysayers,9
Spray and pray at it again,2
Lord Umesh can't even do it in powerplay,4
The meme Gods have appeared to Umesh and have reminded him of his true purpose in life whenever he wears the RCB colors!,5
Relax. This is just a setup by Lord umess for.......Something,6
U-mess Yadav,2
Kohli's killer looks are back,2
"Wow such poor bowling . Just like the young umesh, sans pace.",1
A self runout coming?,1
I sometimes think bowlers going over 150 consistently can never sustain themselves. Almost everyone who went over 150 except brett lee had injury issues. 90 - 93 MPH is the sweet spot for human bowling.,7
"Saari duniya idhar se udhar ho jaye, lekin majal hai ki Umesh ki bowling sahi ho jaye",7
2020 is normal again,5
Never doubted you Manish,4
fuck off umesh,2
Fuck you umesh.,2
So fckn easy for these two,2

Does he never get tired of being smashed ?,7
Lord Umesh plssss,3
"Koach brings back Lord Umesh

N seems like death overs have started in powerplay",8
Kohli's expression says it all,7
Umesh has Kohli's nudes.,84
four overs into the IPL and Koach is already done with bowlers' shit,13
Kohli‚Äôs face after the second boundary.,3
Petition to replace the bottom team this year with Gujarat Lions,6

Glad to see YJB continuing Warner‚Äôs poor form. Who‚Äôs needs Broad or Archer when you‚Äôve got YJB,18

"Hot take but hotstar has higher quality and more reliability than any willow tv stream I‚Äôve seen. What do you mean streams don‚Äôt randomly go down at crucial moments?

See Umesh? Even you can be a good bowler if you don't spray everything outside leg,8
"Thanks sunnyG for the analysis and  inputs 

Umesh ain't bowling pads now",3
Manbun Umesh > this Umesh,2
Is Nehra still the bowling advisor/coach for RCB ?,2
Koach cam season is here bois! Not just that but we get 6 weeks of koach cam!,8
2 ball at off stump and both gone for single. Is it too hard to understand umesh?,4
Why you gotta roll over?,2
pandeyji and bairstow gonna take srh home,4
Umesh has been around high level cricket for so long that at this point you'd expect him to get his shit together. Maybe he's never gotten the guidance he needed ala Ishant under Gillespie.,10
"Time to Bring Chahal now, Bairstow needs to Go.",6
Does Pommie want us to believe that the direction of ball swing depends on the day of the week?,3
Umesh Yadav has off side blindness,7
"Shivam Dube , cricket is the only professional thing you do in your life. Don't look so clueless on cricket ground man",13
I think Dean Jones had mentioned yesterday that how players looked apprehensive to dive at these grounds. I hope thats brought to attention before a lot more players get injured.,3
Kohli Cam is more entertaining than watching RCB play,17
Play Siraj and Umesh together you cowards,12

"The cars etc. that players can win, do they actually win them, or is it a bit of a con like on US gameshows?",3

Umesh = 11 an over",9
Plan was to finish Yadav's overs at the start?,2
I feel we should Drop Philippe and Yadav for PP and Morris,4
"Perfect chase so far, no risks decent run rate.",3
Take care of yourself Steyn...I get worried when old players dive,8
Warner happy already.,2
"Australians/English/Afghans/SouthAfrican/Kiwi, so many nationalities represented",9
One Umesh in the death over is game over for RCB.,3
Lord umesh is only playing to bring opposition batsman in form,4
Kohli needs to start saving 3 overs for Saini in the death,8
Umesh keeping Dinda academy's flag flying high.,8
Lord Umesh has IQ greater than Einstein.,1
"Now I'm NOT saying I'm gay, I'm absolutely not, BUT if I happened to find myself with Bhuvi and Manish in a certain log cabin.... Hmmmmmm",-2
The only thing 2020 hasn't ruined is RCB's bowling,3
Bowl umesh in the death you cowards,3
Dale Steyn looking like a Shia LaBeouf character.,13
Fucking middle order of SRH ia laughable.,9
Indian men are fast,2
Have there been injuries in all 3 matches now? Lack of game time is really affecting huh,5
"Is it bad coaching, bad captaincy or bad management? Because i remember Umesh being decent in kkr",5
Kohli shocked face is such a meme,15
Give Kohli an over you cowards,12
Christ. Natarajan was the fastest for us and his average speed was 130.,16
Why do RCB always play with only 10 players and Umesh Yadav,17
 Saini bowling faster than Steyn?,3
Please get these 2 out early they don‚Äôt have a powerful middle order,1
Bairstow looks so clueless when playing offside.,2
"Where is yuzi?? 

Making tik tok with warner or what",18
Steyn looks like he lives in a van outside the hotel smoking weed.,65
YJB SHOT,10
Here's Johnny!,2
Why would you bowl short to Bairstow when there is no fielder there?,2
Moral of the story...Manish is bat man and he must be ignored,1
What a shot Bairstow,4
Pace is useless when it's predictable,9
Bairstow has the best fuck-off swing. Zero effort.,11
Graeme Swann is having a massive orgasm,7
vaughan would be proud,2
[deleted],0
Bairstow doesn't give vibe that he is that good of a player but his performance for England in odi and T20 says otherwise.,1
Good from Ed Sheeran.,8
"SRH tailend( bhuvi, Rashid) batting is stronger than middle order imho.",11
Okay Weasley it's time you head back home,5
YJB looks a lot less nippley in SRH kit than England kit,10
We don't have marsh Today ah,3
Nice shot.,2
"‚Äústrong unit, look at that chest, big biceps‚Äù",25
Umesh keeps bowling at the pads in the leg side...you don't do that...its bowling 101,3
Washington Sundar was a confident allrounder who bowled in Powerplay when he arrived on the scene. He was great even in Nidhas trophy opening the bowling. Koach has turned him in a bat at 8 part timer. Straight talk.,14
"Single after hitting boundary, someone in commentary is happy",9
"Not that innings highlights, that game gives me PTSD",7
That 232 last year gives me PTSD,14
"Just like Warner-Bairstow, Bairstow-Manish might also work, all three are great runners between wicket",10
I'm tired of rcb. Their bowling has been shit for a decade now. Shit management doesn't get anything right,6
"Fuck, that was a good day",11
I'm just looking forward to watching Umesh bowling at the death,13
"I don't know why people are dunking on SRH's batting line up. It is 3D guys, put on your glasses.",18
Johnny fucking the sins outta rcb lords,7
I have no hope now,2
"Shr is going decent at the moment, what happened to chahal though",6
is Williamson injured? why isn't he playing?,2
Bairstow looks like a video game character come to life,9
"I actually feel sad for Kohli, guys gonna play for RCB his whole career",12
"SRH shouldn't play with Bairstow and 10 randos, how much will Bairsteed carry them?",7
RCB will be looking to get the ginger fella out if they want to win this,10
"So Warner 100* vs RCB 2019

Bairstow 119* vs RCB 2019

Damn",10
Is Shakib no longer a good enough player for IPL?,2
"Steyn and Saini bowling brilliant spells. Especially Saini, only one slightly poor ball, fabulous.  Only if Umesh had not shit in the bed",5
"Kohli played
Steyn
Umesh
Steyn
Saini
Umesh
Saini 

Weird order",3
We need to give lord umesh at least 60 more runs to defend so as Long as the rest of the unit can keep to below 80 runs total RCB will win,3
India needs to change their T20 captain if they want to have any chance of getting past the semis,12
Where is Chahal?,6
Noice,6
Get a load of that 6!,3
Inform Pandey is lethal,7
Bajaway haaye pandey ji seeti,6

God that was a clean hit,8
PANDEY POWER,10
Bairstow does look delicious,5
"Yeahhh pandey garu, we expect nothing less from you",8
"I need an app or a stream or something that does that IPL trumpet sound at random intervals. Just not the same without it...

Nice shot.,5
Muralliiii :'),12
Now Washington washing out rcb chances,1
Put ya mask on you little shit,6
Powerplay spinner at the 6th over kekw,2
Rcb could defend the total of Saini and steyn had 10 overs each,5
Manish anna really hates Kohli's shenanigans,7
Iyer and pandey looks same to me,4
"Oh, Sundar. As Geoffrey Boycott would say, 

""It's a hit me ball. Come, hit me"".",4
SRH team selection tanked after Moody left,3
Ffs we don‚Äôt need another run machine Sundar,2
"How long before someone call out awful captaincy of Kohli over the years in IPL. Why is Chahal still not in, on that note?",0
"""pAnDeY CaN oNlY hIT fOuRs""",4
"woah, pandeyji hitting the G spot",3
Manish pandey has transformed in the last year or so.,4
Pandey ji is big dick energy.,8
"The more Manish performs, the more pissy i get at Koach. Same applies when Iyer performs as well.",3
"Washington Sundar, hearing his name for the first time in a long time. Thought he'd be the next big thing.",1
Not enough air time for Haddin's crotch,4
Bat sounds are better one of the benefits of no crowds,5
It is amazing how the first power-play is such an accurate predictor of the result. Looks like the Sunrisers will win....,1
Excellent comeback though,5
What happened to Nabi? Isn't he better than Mitchell Marsh?,6
Did they change the game on sky sports?,3
What happened to yuzi?,3
Chulbul and his long levers. Noice.,1
"Q - What kind of a bowler is Sundar? 

A  - It's complicated.",6
My stream has switched to Windies vs England women. Fuck fuck,6
What's point hitting six if you  play dot all 5 deliveries,7
Classic Pandey single of the last ball.,3
"Classic Manish Pandey vs spinners. 4 or 6, lots of dots and the a single. 

Rinse and repeat. 

Really needs to work on strike rotation in the middle overs",10
Stop hogging strike from bairstow smh,4

Yuzi!,3
Pandey is the ceo of finding the fielder,20

Great fielding practice from Pandey to RCB fielders...,2
Fitness of Kohli is God level!. One of the fittest sportsperson in the world.,13

Yuziiiii,6
"when cricbuzz doesn't update for a long time, dhak dhak hone lagta hai",13
Interested to see how Philippe keeps to spin. He was ordinary in the big bash but has been around Haddin in the Aus squad ~~and SRH~~ lately so would have done a lot of work.,12
 googly incoming,3
"After watching Chawla and Rashid bowl darts, really refreshing to see someone actually bowl slower and with flight

Chahal and Amit Mishra are my fav spin bowlers to watch. They actually give it a rip.",16

This crowd noise is absolute garbage. They should‚Äôve made an option without crowd noise like EPL,-1
Yuzi yuzi yuzi,8
Lol Bairstow can't pick anything from chahal,8
Ginger has no clue whatsoever.,1
This is SRH's last batting pair lmao,11
"2 best spinners are bowling now for RCB. If these 2 don't find a wicket now, the game is most certainly over for RCB",5
This is like a slow bleed.,2
it is hard not to like SRH. They have the underdog vibe about'em.,8
Deano LMAO,4
Privacy as a feature ads of Apple doesn't make sense. 99% of India doesn't care about privacy.,5
Fucking Sky Sports changing to the Women's match. Who the hell wants to watch that,-2
Is this the first time Bairstow is facing Chahal after WC match? Remember him and Roy thrashing Kulcha badly and humiliating,5
"Main difference between Sundar's and Chahal's overs? 

The length. 

When are these run leak specialists like Umesh and Sundar gonna learn?",2
That time when Moeen Ali murdered Kuldeep,11
Never fails with Sky switching channels mid game. Very annoying when you have it paused to do something.,9
Better bowl out Umesh before the death,2
Bowling Umesh out. I like it,7
Kohli just want finish Umesh's overs.,3

Lord Umesh pls get a wicket now,-1

Need him in death. Defended 26 against dhoni last time.",1
"When I see IPL VIP boxes, I think extreme income inequality, kids not getting a chance just because they happened to be born poor, nepotism, greed, the bad luck of being born poor and spending one's life being stuck in a life of poverty and crime. It always takes me out of the game.",7
"Till now 6 teams have played, fielding rankings according to me : 

SRH

Kohli to Umesh : "" benchod, seedha daal ..""",70
You cannot win IPL with bowlers like Siraj/Umesh Yadav and Mohit/Ishanth Sharma,12
Jonny Bairstow taught Sachin Tendulkar how to bat,11
Bairstow for 2.2 crores might turn out to be an all-time great IPL buy,41
Give dube the ball n make him new lord,7
[deleted],4
"What was the need to bring in Umesh when Sundar and Chahal had established certain amount of control! Bairstow throws his wicket away after facing spin from both ends, and Chahal was owning him",5
Ok anyone know why Mr Nags has been brought to the UAE? Surely he's not essential in the current COVID climate,12
"All sixes from Bairstow looked so easy, even than Stoinis",10
Hope Mitchell Marsh is ready to play. We need him to finish innings like these.,9
I forget what its like being a RCB fan,7
Is there literally no replacement for Umesh? Don't mention Siraj.,12
What's up with these creepy mattress ads on hotstar. making me anxious looking at my bed.,6
Dada's head is proof that money can transform you from a baldhead to having Anil Kapoor-like hair.,11
RCB missing Nehra standing by the crease,11
Umesh shouldn't be in a competitive IPL team,6
so khatabook is desi splitwise?,2
This should be the last year with umesh. Send him over to csk next year. He's s old enough for a spot. I reckon he'll suddenly start playing like a god there but it's umesh we're talking about,41
Indian advertisements are just too good,5
"Umesh is The impostor

0 impostors remain",14
Who else thinks Kohli's frequent outbursts on the field effecting the morale of the team members?,4
"But hey, I'd take Umesh over Siraj any day",4
Yuzi is here,1
"Fun fact : if you pronounce dube just like you do lube, air would be exhaled from your nose",1
"Who'd win the competition of giving most runs between Umesh, Siraj, Kaul, Dinda and maybe add Mohit Sharma?",4
"Cmon Yuzi, save the game.",2
Umesh may have betrayed us with that first wicket but he remembered where his loyalties lie. Good man.,4
Yuzi fangirling AB and ignoring Kohli lmao,5
Guys while they have a break comment your rankings for fielding of 6 teams which have played till now !!,3
"Santosh Mane, the Indian knockoff Sadio Mane",6
Even Coronavirus can't stop Umesh Yadav from bowling absolute rubbish every time,3
Rotate Pandey,6
I LOVE UMESH YADAV I WILL SACRIFICE MY LIFE FOR UMESH YADAV,15
Last guy ain't moving at all. absolute madlad,14
What kind of mood swings are those supporters on the screen having?,5
steyn promoting patanjali sneaking in those warmups.,2
Just get through with chahal and that would be good.,5
"Can they give the captaincy to Finch? I mean he is definitely better than Kohli in limited overs.

Also Rohit should captain Indian team in limited overs.

Kohli is great in tests though.",14
Haha all the fans putting in an exaggerated show for the cameras and the one dude staring into my soul,17
Uncle Reddy dabbing in the corner. üòÅ,3
"I hope the UAE has good servo pies, don't want poor Finchy getting homesick",6
Remember when Pawan Negi was one of the primary bowling options,5
Umesh mate 12 seasons in and you're yet shite,13
"Lamoo , that dude at the end was forced to be on cam for sure",6
IPL is the mecca of T20.,1
"2020 being the exceptional year, where weird things happen, there is now new exception for RCB, their bowling is still shite.",3
"These batsman are very capable of turning singles into doubles, RCB has to be in top shape with the fielding, which until now they have",5
missing nehra with his funky jim carrey hat style on the boundary.,9
"I'm a big fan of Chahal when he's bowling slower and flighting the ball

Seen him bowl flatter and quicker too often though",2
Who the hell was thinking that sending Dubee instead of Phillips was a good idea,7
Yadav used to atleast get wickets earlier despite being expensive. Now that has also stopped happening,8
Sometimes I miss shitting on Sanju Manju's commentary.,20
Has someone told Bairstow you don‚Äôt have to run 2 every ball?,2
Lord umesh needs 15 to score fastest 50 of this match,15
Gwan Bairstow. Representing mother England.,13
"Who's yelling ""Yuzi"" every 3 seconds?",6
Nice to see spinners flighting the ball!,3
Let's see whether the remaining IPL teams need/can accommodate Kanos. RR: A better T20 batsman and skipper than Smith. KXIP: Need a solid No. 3 and captain as well. DC: Need a sensible head to stop the frequent collapse and captain as well. RCB: Koach needs a Bro and helping hand in captaincy once AB retires. CSK: This is a franchise that needs him the most and it's no secret Now. MI: They look like the team least in needs of his service. But I don't think MI would mind playing him at No. 3.,9
Looks like Josh Phillipe is a natural shitposter behind the stumps,12
Feel so bad for Chahal. He always has to compensate for a bad Umesh over.,9
wtf the crowd noise is [there in the stadium as well](https://twitter.com/DanishSait/status/1308076469545918464),7
"Much like the players, the shit posting has only improved since the first game... Enjoying the thread in these last 2 games.",4
Not playing udana  is a bad idea for RCB,3
After how many ipl wins by rohit and does kohli resign from captaincy.,1
Will hurt RCB fans but from now SRH should win it easily. Sorry guys,5
Selmon Bhoi with his pepsi from dukaan,9
"Gavaskar and KP are still sucking off AB and VK for 8 run overs, while no one talking about Umesh for his 14 run overs.",13
[deleted],22
RCB are benching one lord to rule them all: Lord Negi.,1
Chat>Keeping skills,3
umesh needs to join the dugout.,3
"Oh fuck me, Umesh gets an over at the death",6
SRH should cross the line easily unless they take inspiration from yesterday's punjab,5
Bowling Saini now and saving the Umesh over for the death? Not a fan.,7
Stop playing those fucking horn sounds,3
That was a good ball saini,2
"Anyone remember when RCB overpaid for Tymal Mills massively after 3-4 good matches and he went for 10rpo+, couldn't take wickets, was dropped and is now out of the IPL.",12
"Simon Doull and KP, two mega minds at work together. You love to see it",4
Any time the opposition looks like winning: DAE ViRaT KohLi Is A ShIt CaPtAin!!?,11
Why am I so stressed for Bairstow lol,3
"Lol when u bench Morris 



U fuckin deserve this",3
Umesh has a magical touch.,2
Kohli is  like  the emperor with no clothes. Everyone knows he is a unworthy captain but no is brave enough to tell him.,16
"Me: come on folks, poor Umesh is bowling in flat Bangalore wicket

*then checks venue* 

#ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",4
"5th bowler still has 3 overs to go in the last 10. Bad planning from Koach, needed to get one more out of Dube or Sundar early.",2
"Tbh if this was a team with a strong middle order and not SRH, this game would already be over. I do not see teams like MI, CSK, KKR fucking up from this position.",4
Rcb playing with  only one lord seem unfair for opposition,3
Kohli captaincy slander back on the menu?,6
Bring back Vinay Kumar to RCB!!,5
Maybe Koach can be a non playing captain in T20 like Jaidip Mukerjea used to be in the Davis Cup.,3
What does it mean if marsh can‚Äôt play? Can someone replace him or does srh only have 10 players to bat,5
Those horn sounds are so irritating holy shit,7
What's with manish Pandey's khelu ya chodu kindof batting ?,1
"Why the fuck are there fake horn sounds.

Just play generic human sounds, jeesus",3
How have these two turned a t20 into a comfortable ODI,2
If the game goes to death overs koach has 1 over left for umesh,4
"uhh, Saini has 1 over left for the death",2
How many times they gonna milk AB d villers 50,5
Just here for nasty comments ! Don‚Äôt dissapoint,4
This is turning out to be a fantastic game.,3
"for all that runup saini builds, he bowls very slow",-7
Why has sundar only got one over,2
Bullet,10
Fuck me he's hit that so hard,8
**WTF**,3
Has Finch dropped the match?,6
yeah you chew that gum finch,7
Thank god,3
IPL fielding ‚Ñ¢ strikes again,6
"I know how to make players not perform. 

Just pick them in my fantasy team! Works 100% of the time!",27
Who's gonna bowl at the depth. Sundar?,3
The difference between RCB's 'flying' start an SRH's bog standard start at the halfway mark is 8 runs.,13
"Virat doesn't like you, Finch",1
"Finch: happy when Warner got out

Finch: drops Bairstow

Is Finch secretly English?

The evidence don't lie",45
Horror game from Finch.,3
"r/cricket: Thank god no crowd means no vuvuzelas
Star: hehe vuvuzelas go brrrr",22
"Just give the crease to Pandey for a bit Jonny...

Justification: Bad vibes",3
Haha..now kohli not having the guts to bark his loud mouth at finchy?,2
That should have been caught.,2
They literally need 2 wickets(these two) rest are nobodies!!,4
Who's gonna bowl at death?,7
Shit game from Finch,6
"YJB 2

Aussies 0",23
This wickets shite honestly,8
Kohli not playing out Umesh in Powerplay. Same old mistakes,1
Quality bowling by Saini. Deserves a wicket,4
Mai boi Rashid should come one down from the next match. His batting has improved so much in the last 2 years. He should be groomed as an allrounder. Time is now .,5
"Aight SRH. That was our only chance. You guys got Washington, Umesh and prolly an over from dube to smash. This is a one way road now",3
"Fair play, I‚Äôd call for a change of trousers after that one was hit at me.",7
Ffs kohli who's gonna bowl in the death,3
Guys we still have some chance . (proceeds to check u mesh has one left ) Never mind.,5
Wow Umesh Yadav over at death? gg SRh!,2
finch exhausted with all the continuous cricket.,3
Sundar and chahal needed to bowl together. Koach playing 420D chess by bringing umesh.,1
Saini bowling like an absolute chad.,2
Man saini is really good,2
So last four will be umesh styen saini styen. Not bad given the circumstances.,1
"It is very hard to win the IPL with RCB, some might even question its possibility. Maybe Kohli realizes that and just shows up to make his base salary because he knows he will never be dropped. His base salary is already very high, and with RCB it is hard to win the big prize money so that seems like the path of least resistance",4
I TRIED SO HARD AND CAME SO FAR,2
"This is just the second game on this pitch, already the low bounce is happening every over. Its going to be a shit show in the latter half of IPL",1
this song perfectly fits kohli's ipl career,7
"Tried so hard and got so far...


Perfect timing of the song when RCB is playing",2
Kohli should bowl himself. Do it you spineless fuck,5
Can't wait for Dube to bowl last over ü§£,2
"""I tried so hard, and got so far. In the end, it doesn't even matter""

How apt.",8
"Might be recency bias, but this IPL genuinely seems to have the worst set of ads in a long long time.",3
"*in the end it doesn't even matter*

perfect song for RCB",9
"Finch with his odi opening and this shit fielding, dare I say parthiv would have been better.",0
Please put Umesh outside the bubble.,3
Kohli is gambling with his best bowlers,4
Dhoni Gambhir Rohit no captain can make a difference if you play shit cricket like this.,2
I can't believe even with noone in the ground I have to listen to the horns,8
Dube warming up for bowling 18th and 20th.,6
"iPhone international ads - super class. Makes us go wow. 

iPhone Indian ads - oily haired Indian dude doing cringe.",5
"Why do u hate my guy UMESH ? It‚Äôs because u guys spend ur day in front of a PC and Umesh hangs out with hot chicks and gets more pink pussy in a single day than y‚Äôall get in your entire lifetime. I wouldn‚Äôt be too wrong to say that I d fuck him if I wasn‚Äôt a boy , that‚Äôs the biggest compliment a guy can give a guy . If it wasn‚Äôt for the anonymity I would have chased the people hating my Umesh",12

Yeah keep chewing gum guys,4
Surely ball watching is what you want to do as a keeper?,12
Bairstow wants to smack the ball harf,1
Even Finch drops catches when in RCB.,5
"I remember that post that asked people not to call Umesh ""Spray and Pray"" .",6
Management couldn't even get kfc for players ?,3
Why tf does every ball find kohli,1
I love white ball YJB so much,2
Is it just me or for the past year or so chahal has been pretty average as a bowler,2
"Rcb has never won a cup straight

N finch was tryna reverse cup lol",2
Even Bairstows hair matches the SRH color,3
Philipe you twat. Parthiv is better than this.,1
"Ganguly: I'm going to become the president of the BCCI and weed out corruption and take Indian cricket to great heights.

Also Ganguly: Hey you young person, gamble your hard earned money during the Covid enforced lock down on this mobile gambling app that I get millions to endorse.",16
Josh having a horrid game. Can't piss off Koach,4
"Jeez Bairstow, it is okay to have a slower phase in the middle overs",2
Chahal is a goddamn magician.,2
"Pls Rcb don‚Äôt ruin my day and break my heart,let‚Äôs get started on 
a good note. Just get these two and we‚Äôll win",1
Can we start if etc team looses etc matches RCB qualifies equations now?,3
Lol what acrobatics Umesh !,3
These Aussies love to chew gum. Lol,2
[deleted],9
"Great effort yadav, see you guys abuse him. Everyone day sorry",4
specialist keeper lmao,4
Not a good day for Australians,1
"Bruh, why did RCB play 3 overseas batsmen, when Umesh Yadav clearly concedes too many runs, they could have just played Morris. I swear, Kohli doesn't get enough flak as RCB captain.",2
Bairstow looks in good nick. He should make a comeback to the English test side.,1
YJB huffing puffing now. Not very hopeful tbh,2
"Bairstow has so much luck :(


RCB do something (*pokes with stick*)",2
No please no,3
"Kohli needs to be released in the mega auction, the guy needs to have his suffering ended",2
"Damn, I hate Manish Pandey 

Even if he‚Äôs consistent, he slows down the game and makes it boring",2
Waste review,1
"Kohli's saying he heard something

Interesting",4
Rcb gonna rcb,4
Classic kohli,6
Gotta take that Review!,3
We're fucked lol,7
Typical Kohli review lmao,6
Expecting RCB to win. Is there a more hopeless cause?,1
"Either make AB keep or play Parthiv. 

This middle ground is honestly super confusing - they've downgraded the keeping and the batting.",2
Kohli DRS fail incoming?,5
Shit review or hit review ? Naah the viraat kohli review,6
Ah yes Kohli asking josh Phillipe for review advice. Gg,10
Rock and roll inb4,2
That's the best thing Umesh has done so far with that fielding,3
Not out,2
Lmaooo Kohli,4
1 over from Umesh and 3 from 5th bowler. They can play out chahal and Steyn for maidens and still win comfortably,3
Shit review,7
he's out,0
Can you rock and roll that for me,3
That's a bold review,2
OUT,1
The umpire looks like my physics teacher when I say I don't remember the 3 laws of Newton,3
No RCB match is complete without a failed Kohli review,10
FOR SURE,2
"At first I had a doubt, then Kohli chose to review, I am sure it‚Äôs not out now.",8
Kohli never learns,1
Oreejinal deceezun,4
I AM DEAD INSIDE,2

"'Does he look guilty?' bruh he always looks guilty, don't judge based on that",18
That's unbelievable,2
Wrogn review you deaf fuckin cunt!,3
He probably heard the baby kicking,8
Kohli should be banned from taking DRS decisions.,10
Bring back rock and rolling.,3
"Ngl, could have sworn I heard something in real time as well.",5
was there an edge ?,1
"If this review fails, we are seeing probably last of Phillip",4
Damn wanted to hear him ask to rock and roll that for him,3
Why is Williamson not in the team?,1
Atleast that was close so not a bad review,3
Take it forward was way funnier. Bring back take it forward,2
Ohh Pandey....,5

Why don't they directly go to UltraEdge? What's the use of watching it with naked eyes?,9
Lol Pandu,2
WTF was that Pandey,4
Pandey must have thought this was an ODI match,3
Chahal definitely deserved that.,5
Poor shot,1
Absolutely deserved that. Courageous bowling to keep bowling it slower and invite the slog.,4
Nice nice nice nice nice,1
Pandey was an imposter,6
it was his strategy to break the momentum and then get him out. 18d chess by koach,6
[removed],33

I am always average Pandey departs,3
Bad shot selection from Pandey wait for the fifth bowler or umesh. Should have stayed till end.,3
Advice - don't go for sixes,2
"1 billion people to Kohli : "" we think it is not out. No need for a review""

Kohli : "" fuck you all "".

*raises hand for review*",5
RCB's new objective: keep Bairstow off strike cuz they can't get him out in this life fo sure.,7
Could be in for another quality finish here!,2
"Stupid cunt Dhawan. Doesn‚Äôt even know one tip, one hand rule.",11
The whole match is dependent on Bairstow now.,2
Shit batting by Chulbul. That was an ego shot. He just didn't want to give Yuzi a dot or a single. Respec the bowler when he's doing well.,8
Wtf? We assigned Riyan Parag as our no.4?,3
Tactical review to pressure Manish to throw his wicket the next ball.,13
Goddamn it Chahal still has one more,3
Umesh sprayav,1
"Kohli, do your finishing up the end quickly thing.",1
Pandey's IPL career strike rate is 120...,3
Holder school of reviews,5

Normally 2 wickets down at 12 overs is not bad but it‚Äôs srh so.....,4
Chahal is bowling quite well. Now i feel bad for the memes made on him.,1
Dube dubayega RCB ko dekhna,2
Scenes when lord Umesh dismisses YJB,4

And then Manish throws it away next ball to make it look like the review caused that shit shot.",7
Dube to bowl some absolute pies and get Bairstow out,3

Oh no it's DUBE,3
Dubey ji is here boyzz,1
"Dube, why?",1
9d chess by Pandey to stay just long enough to make Kohli waste his DRS,6

Graeme Swann low-key looks like Andrew Bernard from the office,2
Did koach forgot about sunder ?,2
Why is everyone counting RCB out? They're in a better position to win this IMO.,2
Bairstow will eat Dube for lunch,8
Shivam dube into the attack. It's like Kohli wants RCB to loose this match,9
Dube bowlin at Dubae,9
Star bowler here.,2
Lol when it's time to pressurize SRH. Kohli brought dube to bowling.,3
Fun fact : jethalal trusts on Sundar more than kohli does,8
smash dube for 30,2
How the fuck is SRH batting so damn bad. Like it's somehow worse than last year.,5
"Sunny uncle already a couple of pegs in. ""Manish Dube was playing well"".",4
Can we have Michael Buffer announce ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get ready to trundle‚Äù every time Dube comes on to bowl?,0
Making of lord dube tonight??,1
Dube is 3d all rounder guys,0
I swear josh phillipe was pleading guilty for appealing for that caught behind. Kohli still went for the review.,3
Manish Dube.,1
What are the odds on rain delay or washout match in this IPL?,1
Good Ball,2
If you want to make Kohli cum offer him a sixth bowling option who is average with bat and ball both,7
Chahal is that lalach dene wala bowler in every galli,3
Bright blue shoes with your orange kit must be a fine in the club piss up jar,1
"Why Dube this is the time to get wickets and build pressure, the required run rate is close to ten we should try to push it past 11",1
"Guys, Pandey was just trying to get into Kohli's good books!",1
"Shivam ""how has he played international cricket"" dube",7
I'm convinced dube is in the team for his looks,6
Dube looks like discount Abhishek Bachchan!,2
WE NEED KANE,3
"RCB and INDIA can win tournaments only if kohli steps down as a captain in LOI. The impact of his captaincy crimes outweigh his batting prowess. RTG (biggest crime of all), having a synchopant as head coach, stupid rushed reviews, dropping players after one bad match, and a very reactive style of captaincy (especially in LOIs) are some of his crimes against his team. Someone should grow some balls and tell Kohli to step down.",1
Comms talking about YJB shepherding the tail at 2 down,2
Sunny G - Manish Dubey was really batting well. Eee.,3
does Kohli considers worst play ever possible and yeah m8 lets gamble on it coz why not,1
Johnny sacrificed Warner for all this luck.,2

His name is Cha-haal",8
Philippe auditioning for Painey's spot with that review request,8
Wtf Dube?,1
Man I feel like SRH should have Kane at 3 and maybe try Nadeem over Sandeep or Natrajan. Gives them more stability,2
Garg looks like a lite version of Pandey,1
That blue shoe sure stands out. Lol,2
Look at that fellow Neeraj lmao,3
Kohli Jr at the crease I see.,2
Why the fuck do we always cheap out on Indian players. Fucking hell,9

"Man, Josh Phillipe is really bad.",8
Dube is another 3-D cricketer I see..,1
Shitshow?,1
Lmao hahaha keeping is soo rookie.,6
Wow that was shit from keeper,6
I'd rather have gurkeerat and Moeen ali instead of finch and dube,3
Philippe sloppy work there,4
Can Swanny shut his gutter for a moment?,4
"Seasoned and established players or literal no names, the only sort of batsmen that SRH accepts. No middle ground at all",3
"Name: Shivam Dube

Expectation: Discount Pandya

Reality: Discount Vijay Shankar",34
"Just a reminder that Dube conceded 30 runs against NZ this year.

PS: NZ still managed to lose that low scoring match",13
Scenes if Dube knocks off Bairstow,8
rcb should release sundar if they are not going to use him. Wasting his potential.,8
Kohli is definitely subbed to WSB. The kind of gambles he makes,1
Pawg ??,2
Finch gonna be captain RCB next year's IPL I reckon,0
This is ridiculous. Our best batsman Rashid is sitting on the sidelines. Tch..,7

"Priyam Garg, you can hit the ball too you know",4
Finchy looking for koach's approval everytime.,5
It would be better if Garg just rotate the strike here,2
Damn ngl Dube redeemed himself a bit,4
"Dube over going for 5, 2 of which were leg byes

I've seen it all",5
Lol garg looking like he is not even able to lift the bat. Wasted dubey over.,2
You know your batting is really bad when you score 3 of Dube's over,4
"Manish Pandey has been dismissed for the first time in eight innings in Twenty20 cricket. He scored 217 runs between his last two T20 dismissals. (34, 11*, 50*, 14*, 14*, 31*, 60*, 3*)",9
Please get rid of that Umesh over now,3

Thanks steyn. I've always loved you but I'm afraid it's almost over,2
"Fuck, that might have been the game",1
Match fixed op,-2
Wtf was that from Steyn?,2

Steyn that looked intentional üòÇ,8
Ab lag rha hai rcb khel rahi hai,4
this over is the last power play for Srh,1
Fuck that went too high,4
Steyn stains rcb hopes,2
"3 fucking chances for bairstow, fuck.",6
All I want is life is Umesh not going for a boundary this over,2
of course the lights,3
YJB is going to get a 50 now isn't he,2
"Why isn't.kohli trying for another wicket why dube and umesh yadav, and why not.trying to get a wicket again
Bringing umesh now, will allow Bairstow to get back in the groove",1
Yeah he dropped it but his face expressions were worth it..,12
Who'd YJB make a deal with to receive all this luck?,8
No RCB fan actually thought we'd catch that,6
This they go to third umpire for. Should recheck if he made it or deduct a run,2
Steyn better compensate for that with a wicket or two,1
Umesh is the guardian of RCB tradition tonight!,1
RCB having jersey sponsored by Double Penetration World is too spot on,2
Once again Bairstow has so much luck,6
How shit are the umpires? They sent this to 3rd umpire smh,3

Here comes Umesh. SRH rejoice üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,6
The level of fielding from every team thus far has been below par this IPL.,4
Doull is such a cunt,2
Too much pressure on YJB,2
"Smoked that, YJB!",2
Why don't they play Udana instead of Steyn? He would've been useful in the bowling department in this pitch.,0
Lol fuck this,2
Bairstow times it.,2
Please csk take lord umesh next year. He's old enough to fit in,7
Long haired Daniel Craig should go back to making Bond movies.,7
Is Sundar injured or something? Chahal bowled so well,3
"That's a üöÄ, yes boy",3
"Feels bad for Steyn, he's such a cool guy",8
Indian Moms : Steyn dropped that catch because he didn't cut his hair.,16
England.,2
That was the game,2
Faf would have caught that with his feet while doing a handstand,18
There you go buddy,4
"Brutal, that sound",2
Did Finch just throw with his left?,2
That is some nice acting from Steyn.,5
7 of 3,1
What a shot,1
Is Washington injured? Why umesh?,3
steyn didn't even attempt. wtf,1
Bairstow's one of the most likeable poms.,3
When Bairstow first played for England he couldn't play the short ball and now he just absolutely crunches anything short,2
All this because siraj spoke to steyn.,3
Dude literally slaps the fuck out of a ball,3
Our Lord,2
What's the leg umpire doing if every silly runout appeal is gonna be reffered to the third umpire?,3
Why do the most basic reviews and referrals take so long? Is it purely to show ‚ÄúPAYTM‚Äù as much as possible?,3
Genuinely amazing how reliably shit Umesh is lmao,9
Wtf philippe,3
Never start your campaign against SRH rcb bois,2
Bairstow to Yadav: Now your turn to get a 50.,7
surely this ginger's got springs in the bat,3
SRH got an absolute bargain with Bairstow.,7
I love how crisply the ball gets hit when Bairstow is hitting it cleanly.,5
"Hands nowhere near the trajectory of the ball. 

Clearly lost it in the lights.",2
Philpe is a nice guy,5
How many years has u mess been in rcb,2

I would have been fine with that drop if it was off Garg but not Bairstow,2
What a shit keeper lol proper choice for rcb,8
Friendship with Bairstow continues,3

Phillipe and Finch fixed lol,0

"I love the way how Deano says ""baavan""",5
All we need now is a no-ball to finish this off,1
Disgraceful keeping from Philippe and not to mention the bowling from Umesh,5
"Ah yes, let's bowl short of length deliveries to a player who's favorite shot is a short arm jab towards square leg",6
I guess we can call him shit now,6
Srh should be crying because Siraj isnt playing but lord Umesh will compensate for that,6
Thanks Joshua for getting Bairstow off strike,5

Shitshow,2
Economy of RCB bowlers look decent....and then you have Umesh Yadav,5
Only Faf has done fielding practice this year it seems.,6
Fuuuuck that Doull. No Siraj please.,2

Foakes would have caught that,6
"Umesh ""Murphy's law"" Yadav.",5
Imagine dropping Papa for a jobber lol,2
That was not a missed catch. Steyn just wants to keep Umesh off the team for the season.,2
As much  as the situation sucks there is no other way for up to win it unless bairstow carries the lineup to the end,6
Bairstow smashes the ball like it owes him money.,6
RCB will win this,10
Commentators getting in on the Umesh train,2

Can Umesh get half century?,1
"If srh wins, umesh should be MOTM",6

Once top 3 is gone wickets in hand mean nothing for SRH. So many years and I only wished for a good hitter.,3
Umesh going for a six to get to 50. I can feel it.,4

"Umesh taking advice from saini, such is the humbleness of Lord umesh üôåüèΩ",7

"I just Jizzed to YJB, fellas.",5
Another bottle job by RCB‚Ñ¢¬©,3

How has Umesh conceded 50 runs when he hasn't bowled at the death lmao,4

Only Umesh can make YJB hit on the off side,3
What is the point of Umesh?,1
"If Bairstow hits peak form in the IPL he'll probably genuinely go straight back in the test side, like Buttler did",4
Umesh with a well deserved 48 off 24. Narrowly missing his 50,3
God rcb play yadav every year and nothing changes,1
If we cant bowl Umesh Yadav here then where should we bowl him,6
"Umesh out, Siraj in.",1
"Confirmed, umesh is not playing in the next match!",2
Bairstow has become a truly elite level white ball cricketer.,2
Misses his first 50 this IPL.,3
2 run short gotta feel for lord umesh,2
Never change Yadav. Never change.,3
This is on steyn.,1
Missed out on his fifty by two runs,3
Umesh two short of half-century.Smh,3
Fair play award already sealed up by Umesh. Going at 12 an over while everyone else is going for 6-7 just to keep it interesting,9
"Drop his sorry ass next match, if u wanna convincingly win RCB.",1
RCB just need the wicket of Bairstow and it's all over.,1
Yadav has always got opposition‚Äôs back. No matter what he will get them back.,2
I guess RCB will take it instead of a 6 or a no ball.,2
Why did they have to finish his 4th!!!!! Give it to washi instead!!!,3
Thank you Umesh and goodbye,1
Ah unlucky for Umesh just missing out on his 50.,2
Dogshit captaincy.,-1
Its fun watching Lord Umess bidding a goodbye to his cricketing career. üòá,3

It got interesting after he got out",3

Bairstow babai on fire,5

You give YJB these many lucky escapes you might as well kiss the game goodbye. Shit fielding.,3
RCB jaisi hai tu waisi rehnaüòÇüòÇ,3
[who steyn reminds me of](https://i.redd.it/prnxmeei82jx.jpg),2
Dissolve this franchise already !,6
"Steyn looks like a brickie playing local cricket, all he needs is to be having a smoke at fine leg between his overs",3
"get Bairstow and we are in this.. i believe...
unless lord Vijay Shankar pulls another Bangladesh in UAE..",6
I have a strong feeling that srh gonna duck it up to last over and then rcb will do rcb,9
Anyone clamoring for Dube remember the 30 odd runs he gave in NZ,2
philips only looks good on electronics.,3
Dream 11 ads are nostalgia,3
"Chahal should have bowled this over, in hindsight",2
"I might be getting it wrong. But wasn't there a compulsary uncapped player required in every team?

CSK didn't have any uncapped player in 1st match :

1 Shane Watson, 2 M Vijay, 3 Faf du Plessis, 4 Ambati Rayudu, 5 MS Dhoni (capt, wk), 6 Kedar Jadhav, 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 Piyush Chawla, 9 Deepak Chahar, 10 Sam Curran, 11 Lungi Ngidi",6
Kohli and AB should just open the innings.,7
"Where is the pro death bowler, siraj?",3
I would send Rashid Khan in,4
"I am shocked a team would pick someone like Umesh Yadav for IPL. What is RCB doing - Umesh is the exact kind of bowler who gets smashed - quick, and just bowls at a test match length.",3
"At this rate, RCB will be on covid duty halfway past the season(like last year)",1
RCB has made me discover my Masochism kink...,8
Chahal is a fuckin god,7

Hell yeah bitch,2

Bairstow finally succeeded to fuck himself.,2
FUCKS SAKE BAIRSTOW. THE ONE BOWLER YOU NEEDED TO SEE OUT,7
Fina -fucking-lly,2
Into the tail now... RCB here's your chance.,3
This is painful,1
I just don't understand how you can play at this level for a decade and still be so shit.,6
It's over,2
They can buy all the top players but they would still remain shit,2
What a stupid shot by YJB,3
BEHENCHODs are backk,3
See Chahal out plz,2
There‚Äôs something about using headbands and going for runs. Someone should do a bit of research into this,3
"SRH fans: Bairstow be careful agaisnt Chahal
Bairstow: No I don‚Äôt think I will",17
Bairstow wicket would make this interesting now,8
At least we have Chahal,3
Garg looks like one of those fan kids who win a sponsor contest and gets to wear the team shirt. Decent player tho,10
"""Well balanced side"" My Ass",4
Bairstow. Smooth af,1
"If you think your life is useless , just think about the umpire who refered that to 3rd umpire.",3
Brain dead cricket from Barstow that. This game was there for the taking,2
Why wasn't Chahal brought into the attack earlier?,2
"If you switch Kohli for MSD, how many IPLs would RCB have till now?",2
There's the game,3

"I mean definitely we'll do better than 6 losses in a row right

Right?",4
mudafucker lets gooo,2
Why tf would you attack chahal,3
OH NO Bowled-stow why,2
If Kohli didn't have such a huge ego he would let AB take over the captaincy and concentrate on his batting. But he does.,2
need chahal-zampa double attack asap.,3
Behenchod‚Ñ¢,3
Leg spinner and Bairstow- name a better duo,3

"imma say it!!!


RCB don deserve our [uzzi boii](https://i.redd.it/i6shxv961u151.png)",3
Haha it's like a comedy skit where the narrator is saying what the protagonist shouldn't do....and the protagonist does it.,8
Don't lose now RCB,5
"Still in bois

Thank god for Chahal",3
"Why, YJB, why?",6
"Chahal has become an even better bowler, post marriage.",3
IN CHAHAL WE TRUST,5
RCB are like the Knicks of the IPL. Seemingly forever cursed,2

"Bairstow is out and as usual, Virat mouths the name of his favourite cricketer, Ben Stokes.",6
"Well, this got more interesting.",2
RCB management have so much confidence in Paddikal that they put his initials on everybody else's strip as well.,11
You beauty,2
Get fucked bairstow. Get fucked.,8
Damn Chahal,2
YJB is the Aggarwal of SRH,4
Animated kohli loaded star sports orgasmed with content,3
At least I can focus on work now,10
I don't trust anyone else lmao. Won't be surprised if we lose,18
What  chutya batting by YJB. See him off mfers.,1
">Leg umpiring

"Man how will we survive this IPL if we have to say ""we are fucked"" everytime a wicket fells.",6
"Barstow vs Umesh stat anyone?


He milked Umesh dry as he is supposed to.",7
That was a well deserved *behenchod* from Kohli,17
Baristow has done his job,2
Shouldve used sundar,2
WHY!,1
Kohli shouting bhenchod as always. The guy is a walking meme,23
Bairstow having a brainfade moment,7
CHAHAL MERE BACHCHE TU HEERA HAI HEERA,11
"Aight boys who else can bat

Vijay shankar

Rashid

..?",7
Kohli is screaming like he has come up with a master plan to get Bairstow's wicket. Lol... Chahal is the only one saving Kohli's face to an extent.,5
Chahal taking revenge with YJB for running out his tik tok partner,9
How Yuzi continues to carry the entire team on his back with that wiry frame I'll never understand,18
3D time,2
Always great to see Kohli say 'Ben Stokes',11
Idk if this is unpopular but if RCB were smart they'd have binned Kohli by now. Not a good t20 captain and the resources spent on his wages could be better used considering his style of play,12
"called it boys, we move!",5
THE ONLY WAY BAIRSTOW WAS GETTING OUT FUCK IT,6
if vijay shankar manages to win this for srh I will actually stop supporting rcb,9
Now let's see how good these young players are under pressure.,7
"**15.2** Chahal to Bairstow, OUT, **bowled him!** Oh boy oh boy oh boy, what was Bairstow thinking there? Look for your Fazeer Mohammed clips because this is fully deserving of an animated 'why did he dooo thaaat?' **121-3**

JM Bairstow  b Chahal 61 (43b 6x4 2x6) SR: 141.86",8
"Commentators :1

Baby  Bairstow :0


That's what happens when you don't listen to commentators",6
Gotta love a Ceat tyres strategic time out,7
Why is Kohli's lips purple in that face wash ad lmaooo,3
"Well played Jhonny, we are in this position because of you. Now take rest, young Rashid will take it from here",9
Rcb loves to give hope and then take it away,12
Here starts the tail for SRH,3
Yuzi clips the ginger man,5
Yuzvendra ‚ÄúReward for Risk‚Äù Chahal,6
So we are into tail now.,1
"I think that Bairstow dismissal deserves a ""WHY DID HE DO THAT!""",21
Good opportunity for the middle order to prove themselves.,2
Classic IPL 2020,3
"Srh wins 83% of matches when bairstow scores 40+

Rcb:we still have 17 %

Kohli: Those are the best odds since decades",9
Ngl this Laxxmi Bomb ad is fucking creepy.,2
Over to Shankar to exhibit his second D for the day.,5
"I don't understand how someone can fuck up a winning game. Clearly, Bairstow should've dodged that over but he decided not to. Yesterday, Mayank Agarwal fucked up a winning game by going for a boundary when only 1 run was needed.",7
Lmao this fake aggression by Kohli is hilarious.,-4
[removed],1
"LOOK KOHLI BC, this what Chahal can do. Not sure why he took him off",5
Kohli celebrates like he wins worldcup,1
Mitch Marsh seemed to be in decent form in England. SRH still has a chance I'd say,1
"Same old RCB, 'Ee sala cup nammade!' at the start of the season, and then they show that they're still dependent on AB and Kohli, and bowl and field poorly.",2
Only good thing about RCB is there are no chonkers,2
allow me to use this moment to introduce you guys to [this masterpiece ](https://i.redd.it/i6shxv961u151.png),6
Virat telling Bairstow that Ben Stokes is the best ginger cricketer,2
"vijay shankar, rashid should be able to take it from here. dont do anything stupid in chahal's over.",2
"Very confused by the selection of Phillipe. I assume the lad is decent with the bat (?) but what's the point if he comes in that far down the order? Essentially then, he is playing a solitary keeper-only role and making mistakes 

More importantly, isn't it a total waste of an overseas spot. Aren't there any Indian keepers in the RCB squad?",3
Even SRH is using Shankar as a finisher. He is more like a 3-4 batsman I think.,3
It's up to the srh tail to see this through,3
"Oh man! Washington and dube gotta control 2 overs somehow. 

Next over will be dube I guess",5
No Virat that was Bairstow. Ben Stokes is the other ginger,19
"YJB when he's in 

Why, JB? When he's out",5
"Rashid ""finisher"" khan waiting.",3
M Marsh's 115 T20 SR should be sending shivers down Kohli's spine...,6
Convinced umesh has kohli's nudes,9
It's all on Lord Shankar now,6
Never underestimate RCB's talent in finding a way to choke. Let's wait and watch.,7
"But seriously though, if not Umesh, then who?",5
Who is pronouncing dew as jew?,1
"God, can't have Shankar now and see 2 two Tuk Tuks in the grease.",1
All the IPL matches have been extremely thrilling despite average scores so far!,8
Why JB?,2
Ah my heart is beating at a very rapid pace now,3
I-I trusted you Bairstow,2
I don‚Äôt even care if they get 4 dot balls now,2
Ppl still praising lord umesh for his performance,1
Still two overs left of Dube/ Sundar,2
[deleted],6
Isn't strategic timeout just a marketing term for the need to play a lot of adverts?,3
Imagine being a 3D world cup #4 batsman and seeing an u19 player grab your spot.,12
okay it‚Äôs over,3
YJB always got that face like someone asked him to divide 677 by 43,12
Holy shit Chahal,9
When Dube has the lowest economy.....,6
"I repeat 

Chahal is a fuckin god",16
C'mon chahal you beautyyyyyy,12

Don't jinx his hattrick,1
"Yes, come on now bois!",3
Not like Shankar would have helped. Just get him out of the way.,4

3 sub-130 T20 strike batsmen + 2 inexperienced ones at no 3-7 is terrible squad construction,2
Let's see how 2 U19 stars take it from here,9
Vijay Shankar is remarkably consistent,10
Plz dont choke this now pleasee,3
"> **Time-out!** 43 from 28 balls and you'd generally think the batting team might have a slight advantage, but with Bairstow's departure the momentum is with RCB and they would back themselves to close the game. 

Its RCB ffs, they never close out games",1
SRH poor middle order will be exposed now.,1
fuck chahal for robbing us of Dube v Shankar confrontation,1
2 20 year olds at the middle can pull it off ??,7
"Our batting was never good, save for the openers. Now that the bowling is shit too, I guess it's back to the good old Deccan Chargers days of 7-8th positions. Absolutely retarded team management, where the fuck is our middle order ffs.",3
3d,1
 InB4 U-19 Bois take us home,1
"If my girlfriend had sex with Chahal, I'd be jealous of my girlfriend.",1
Vijay Shanker is so shite. He always looks confused and has zero confidence in himself. No idea why he keeps getting selected,2
Where's MS Rashid tho? He can bang a few sixes,2
"6 wickets left. 42 off 26

Most Teams - We can still do this

SRH - Let's go home",2
"Every great RCB game consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". When RCB shows you something ordinary: a dropped catch, poor bowling or a misfield. Perhaps you inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"". RCB takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. That's why every RCB game has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige"".",4
Fucking love Yuzi,3
Always wanted to see how a 3D Golden Duck looks like.,2
If you get stumped off a wide on your first delivery is your score 0(0)?,1
Why is Shankar so surprised as if he has never done something like this before . LMAO.,9
Make Chahal the captain you cowards.,3
"Why was Shankar ever in the Indian team, like srsly",6
"IPL timeouts are stupid.
All players were ready for the action and yet we waited a minute for the clock to countdown before starting.

These need to be optional, if you're a bowling team and bowling well then you shouldn't be forced to take the timeout.",6
TIL that Abhishek Sharma has 171 S/R is IPL.,5
"Never change, 3D",3
dis fake chanting thoughüòí,0
I seriously don‚Äôt think Abhishek Sharma and Garg can do this,4
"as an srh fan, i understand how rcb fans must feel now... man what a sad life",4
"Rayudu - 1

Shankar - 0",7
Can someone explain the 3D thing to me?,3

Y no Nabi?,1
"Virat is everything Indians hate about Punter just with less captaincy accomplishments, change my mind.",9

Logic , strategy, sense ??",3
"Remember the time when we had Hooda, Yusuf and Pandey for middle order??

I am more hopeful now than that time...",8
Abhishek is a good batsman tbh.,6
DC got Rabada for 4 cr. What were RCB doing in that auction?,23
Both Shankar and Dube today showing why they shouldn't play for India.,8
Going for the double fist bump and then receiving a double high five is the most awkward thing ever,6
On your screen: Guy carrying RCB for last 4 years and also Virat Kohli,14
Rayudu just ordered a biriyani,9
"That was an ugly hack though, from Bairstow.",6
Nabi should have been in squad.,3
[removed],2
Where's the short leg? Where's the bat pad? Absolutely nothing for the hattrick ball,2
Googly hitting top of middle stump. What a beautiful sight.,7
"Abhishek is 21 and Garg is 20. SRH middle order, ladies and gentlemen",11
Look at Chahal's economy rate too. Amazing.,2
Wait! We still need to bowl 2 overs from Dube. FML ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,3
Been a great start to the ipl for rayadu,6
"Chahal has been preparing well since pubg and tik tok both have been banned.

Chahal OP.",12
"Not playing Williamson is catching up to Srh, turns out putting all hopes on two batsmen is not a good strategy.",3
Fucking Fearless!,4
Anyone else think Garg's shoes are like that indicator in cricket games which show where the ball will pitch?,3
Abhishek Sharma for the win,2
Take that matchstick,5
Sharma gives no fuck,2
Srh is dead after openers,2
SRH needs 4 more overs of Umesh,7
Okay now just don't concede runs I don't want fucking Rashid khan to come out and slog it out,6
Chahal was like can't leave it to fielders anymore. Love SRH as well but I want RCB to have some good times this year. Its just been getting sad every year with RCB,4
"srh tryna play rcb, lol you just love to see it",2
did 3D flop because cinemas are closed due to covid?,8
"Why didnt they promote rashid

He can launch few",1
that AB runout probably will end up being the difference,4
Oh fuck nevermind,2
[Abhishek sharma scored 46(19) vs RCB in 2018](https://www.iplt20.com/video/136347/5-star-performance-from-teen-star-abhishek-sharma-46-19-),18
Rayudu doing cartwheels probably,5
Abhishek has balls.,11
"YJB didn't have to slog a bowler he was struggling to pick up, who was bowling his last over, with no other experienced batsmen to come",2
"I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE KID IS BUT HE JUST HIT A FOUR, WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE IPL BENCHODS",6
"fret not, SRH. young rashid is still in the shed.",9
That was clean,3
Thank God umesh's spell is over else even tail will believe in chasing this down,6
"Oof. 

Ballsy shot that.",1
"He could have blocked chahals last ball but chose to attack him

Appreciate the guts",5
Oh only 2D today is it shankar,2
"It amazes me that SRH still haven‚Äôt fixed their terrible batting woes. They only have a top 3. Most teams have proper late order superstars. They don‚Äôt even have a recognizable batsmen after Pandey.

Warner literally carries their batting every season. He is so good that he is actually able to do it season in season out.",5
"What is this i am feeling?
Is this hope!",7
This Abhishek has balls of steel. Second ball and it‚Äôs from Chahal but he‚Äôs like nah I‚Äôm going to smack it.,6
Hopefully Abishek Sharma plays like the innings he did for DD vs RCB in 2018,3
"Abhishek can bat.

Last year he smoked 46 runs in 18-19 balls against RCB.",3
"Time for  pace now. 

Please bowl Dubey, Steyn and Saini",2
"Man, i'd love to see these youngsters finish this game. Such a confident boost for them",2
Game is lost mates... Just see us collapse...,2
With two free overs left SRH are still in it,2
"Good, at least we kept the run-rate under control but someone needs to finish here. We really put the burden on the youngsters.",2
"that shot was ""gand mara bdsk"" to chahal",3
"Garg and Abhishek have ability to win this, They just need someone experienced on the other end. They'll miss Marsh more in batting than they did in bowling.",3
A wise old sage once said ‚ÄúNever lose hope if you‚Äôre chasing against RCB‚Äù,5
Kane in place of Marsh and Samad in place of Garg just fixes this team. How hard is it to see..,4
Well bowled chahal. You did your job.,2
RCB need 2 wickets for me to get my cashback,3
RCB winning chances are like heartbeat graph,5
SRH have one of the world's best middle order batsmen in the world and they're sending out kids to save them the game.,4
Kill me,1
Is Yusuf Pathan playing for SRH this year ?,1
Garg should step up,1
How old is Rashid?,2
"2. What will be Yuzvendra chahal‚Äôs economy per over? Less than 6 ‚úì

3. How many times will an on field umpire give out in this match? 5 or more

Not sure what the question is actually asking, but probably ‚úì",3
did sundar injure himself?,3
I think it's time to just rid of shankar and try virat/ samad,3
Again my heart is beating super fast,4
"RCB still wanna lose, playing Dube",8
I remember Yuvraj rated this guy Abhishek pretty highly couple of years ago. Hoping he will prove Yuvi right.,3
What's so wrong with sundar? Why can't theh bowl him instead?,3
RCB never learns. Rashid and Yuzi both troubled the batsmen on this pitch. Why doesn‚Äôt Sundar get to bowl out his 4 overs instead of Yadav?,2
"JUST GIVE THE BALL TO WASHINGTON SUNDAR !!!!!!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

WHY DUBE!? WHY !?",5
Why would a commentator think Sundar is a part time bowler?,1
This is textbook RCB. Gives us some hope towards the end and then proceed to absolutely butcher it.,6
Lord shivam is back to restore balance.,4
"Abhishek Sharma will win this for them. I think he's an underrated youngster who's flown under the radar. 

Let's see how this ages. (-_-;)",5
Dube's in bois,2
Chahal the light in the dark RCB,3
Get moeen in and make ab keep. Much better ig.,3
Lets see if dube remains human or transforms into a lord today,3
"If Vijay got nudes of any of the selectors close ones, I hope his hard disk dies, he forgets his cloud backup password and the hardcopies gets damaged in washing machine accident.",7
"Dube in, hold on to your nerves bois and girls.",6
"If there's a bowler that has the ability to get whacked around the ground by two 20 yos, it's Dube",11
Yuzi >>>>>>>> Kuldeep,10
This is still SRH's game if they are hungry enough.,3
Dube vs Abhishek,1
DUUUBE DUUUBE DUUUUBE,3
"**Most IPL wickets in UAE**

**Yuzvendra Chahal 10**

Mohit Sharma 9

Sunil Narine 9",5
[deleted],6
Lol I joked about Dube bowling 18th and 20th at the start. Here he is for 17th and 19th. RCB are a Joke lmao,3
Any update on Mitch marsh?,2
Want to see some Rashid Khan nonsense shots later,3
"Do feel sad for Vijay Shankar... Man gets a lot of hate  for a comment he didn't even make

Sometimes its the selectors/commentators who give out ridiculous statements which the players have to live with


See this with Shane Warne and his hot takes too",7
"I had to switch off for a bit and missed Jonny Bairstow.

Day ruined.",5
Let see if RCB can botch this like Punjab did yesterday,9
Really excited to see how this turns out,2
Why Sundar only one over ?,8
"Abhishek Sharma scored 40 odd of 19 balls against us once, he can finish the game.",8
Can Mitch marsh play now?,2
Where is Fabian Allen ?,1
"Fill in the blanks


*EE SAALA* ________

T: ""THIS YEAR ________""",2
Will Marsh bat?,2
Why is Dube being treated with so much respect,4
"If you can't milk shivam dubey, then you will not be able to milk.other bowlers",8
Get fucked!,6
Will Marsh come and do a kedar Jadhav,4
woooww,2
Dumbo garg,8
Unfortunate !,2
They've given away too many runs ughhh,1
**Fun Fact** : Chahal has worked previously at Income Tax Department as Inspector,1
The most village dismissal I've ever seen,11
"Playing out Dube i see, smart move lads",1
Dube has always had a knack of picking these very lucky wickets,5
"That's such a meme dismissal lmao

Poor Garg, I feel for him",13
wtf was that,3
"As vindication, I want my boi Rayudu to be airdropped into the stadium by the Airforce with a parachute that says in large, red fonts ""Indian selectors talk naah"" while the said selectors to be forced to watch the proceedings with 3D glasses while Ambathi glides onto the middle of the pitch while all players wait and clap.  


BCCI, please at least do this.",13
"Oh bhai , maaro mujhe maaro",7
NGJ XUDN EK2NW1N2MRFUCKING WHAT,4
garg the boss,1
Just embarrassed himself.,4
Scenes when Dube get wickets,10
"I get that Shankar isn't that good, but Jesus the vitriol down below. You'd think he murdered some people or something.",3
I can't believe I would miss Yusuf Pathan,5
Hopefully Garg doesn‚Äôt play another game. Disgrace. Bring back Saha,3
"Jeez, what a bunch of fucking villagers. Just bring in Rashid now",5
Horrible shot,1
BOWLED BHENDI,5
The last time you'd have seen RCB fast bowlers playing well was in that wholesome yorker practice video.,6
This is bad luck. Poor guy,2
"So we all agree that's the best dismissal ever, right?",8
Oh no,2
Lord dube,3
Lmao. That's a bizarre way to get out. üòÇ,3
Dube getting wicket.. That too like this.. Surely it's rcb's year,3
3D d stands for dubey,3
That had to be ugliest dismissal I have ever seen!!,3
SRH imploding,3
So SRH is three deep basically,4
That's one hilarious way to get out,4
That's just plain bad luck. Nothing else.,3
SRH's tail really starts at 4,5
What a nice shot to the wickets!,4
Embarrassing,3
"Lmao, what are these comedy gold dismissals?",11
Man that injury for Marsh is making the difference.,3
Bc,2
Rashid khan to bat next,3
Lmao Garg chutiya,4
Dafaq,2
Dube >>>>>>>>> Umesh,5
I'm dying...,3
How SRH gets batsmen like these? That was comical.,3
Luck scares me...,1
That was so poor.,1
Cue curb your enthusiasm theme.,1
LOL. Even I could have played that better. Well not really. But still LOL,3
Hahaha absolute meme dismissal,2
Is this even international standard anymore ffs,1
RCB is lucky af today,1
Okayy..so Usual IPL PANIC Mode is here,1
Rashid coming in and tonking a couple of sixes might actually be better.,2
Revenge of The Dube.,2
What the actual fuckkk,2
da fak iz diz shigg,1
Pinball,1
Garg has struggled from get go. Looks like we signed yet another mediocre middle order batsman.,8
SRH seriously missing Marsh here,3
Only if SRH had some calm top right handed batsmen named Kane in their squad to select. Can you imagine how useful he would have been in this situation?,10
This is the most embarrassing way to get out in cricket.,6
that's quite embarassing,1
That‚Äôs a stupid shot,4
Rashid is RASHI!!!!!!!!!,1
Dilshan has fucked Indian cricket by making kids go for idiotic shots like that,2
garg bhai voh kya tha,5
Priyam Gag,3
"'Look at us, we're the meme team now'",7
Quite the header,2
Lmao,3
Lol what a facepalm wicket,1
There's pretty much nothing that can happen that will convince me RCB will win. Have 0 faith in them even if SRH at 9 down entering the last over.,2
"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, LOVE YOU DUBE JI",2
SRH middle looks meh. Would struggle this tournament if Warner/Bairstrow do not fire. In the conditions we have seen so far it may not be ideal for those 2. But its early days yet.,1
Lol bhag bc,3
What the fuck,3
da fak iz diz shigg,1
That was a shocking dismissal. Feel for the lad,7
That's quite embarrassing,3

DUBEY JIIIII,1
Bat-Helmet-Bat-Stumps. Damn.,3
Shit bowlers getting shit wickets lmao,5
Yeah Bairstow has used up all the luck of the remaining SRH players,3
I don‚Äôt have much faith Rashid Khan.,2
Attempting a scoop at Dube's military medium pace wasn't a good idea to begin with,2
Dube bowls well. The slow ones arent easy to hit,2
SHIT GETS WICKETS,2
Rashid Khan can win this all by himself lmao,5
bairstow‚Äôs like what is this  *s h i t*  I‚Äôm seeing,8
SRH have the worst middle order easily,11
"**16.3** Dube to Garg, OUT, **bat, onto helmet, onto stumps!** Length ball outside off, walks into the off side and looks for the ramp. It's off the leading edge, onto his grille, and then it lobs onto off stump. This chase is coming completely apart now **129-5**

PK Garg  b Dube 12 (13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 92.30",5
"That was the only way dube could have got wicket.
SRH having brain fade.
This is what happens when you leave brilliant player like Williamson out.",8
"SRH desperately need Marsh

His injury has pretty much been the difference",6
Pritam fucked,5
That was fucking hilarious,8
O god,1
"Garg never looked comfortable. Even that one boundary was bad field placement.

Would still give him 3-4 games minimum.",3
"I could do without the daily dose of cringe, Kartik.",4
Guys idk who the fuck is Garg,2
Why are U-19 captains so bad these days lol,3
YRKFA,2
Rashid gonna fire today u heard it here first,1
SRH to Recall Ben Cutting or Moises Henriques for Marsh replacement,1
Priyam Garg. Just saw his photo upon dismissal. Boyish face like U-14.,4
Come on he's a debutant cut him some slack,5
When Rashid here why fear,4
Yes rashid,1
"Guys, is Imran Tahir playing this IPL - I didn't see him in CSK match the other day.",2
Yesterday and today together all 4 teams trying to lose,3
We need Kanos,3
CHAD RASHID!!,6
Rashid khan going to unleash his inner MSD and win this for srh,2
this is cricket 07 style wicket,3
young Rashid kahn is in boiis,3
Yes Rashid is our middle order.,7
10/10 memes match,9
Task failed successfully!,5
Rashid üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,3
Missing mohammad nabi srh bitches??,3
Dube>>>>>>>>>>,1
Rashid > Priyam,3
"lmao all the reddit chutiyas still living in parents house are abusing garg. He's 19, it's his first IPL game, cut him some slack",1
All you Dube haters can lick his clean shaved face. Mind you have to wait till Kohli's finish with him üò≠üòÇ,5
"""If any team can fuck it up, it's RCB.""

Said this when KKR needed 50 from 3; saying it today",12
Gotta target that Steyn over.,0
Lmao r/cricket has done it time & time again,6
Go Rashid!,1
"This the template for how to handle SRH , get through top 3 and don't fuck up",3
So SRH with a RCB like collapse.,1
Rashid dont give a fuck,3
Misbah would be proud of Garg. üòÇ,4
bhai ek dube pilaade,2
"I don‚Äôt mind KP as much as most, but he suffers badly from thinking something is easy because it came easily to him. He does it a lot.",1
Rashid here to shit post his way to victory,9
No problem boys Rashid will take us home,2
Rashid Khan is a threat,2
Fuuuuuuuuuck Rashid I KNEW IT,4
"Get em Rashid. Our management is is shit,they should have send you before this Garg guy",2
YRKFA to carry it home,1
Lmfao what even is this match.,3
"Keep it together RCB!!Keep it together.

It is winnable.",4
C‚Äômon RCB start off the season with a win!,2
Lmao,2
Rashid the real 3D,2
Can't believe he's only 16,6
That's how dube should be played ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2
RCB vs tailenders never ends well. Foolish of them to not keep the middle order batsmen on strike.,2
Do not be deceived by Rashid's batting position. He's the only srh player who can play the finisher role,6
Chasing 160+ is kinda tough with 7 tail-enders.,8
Please Dube don‚Äôt bowl loose balls just keep it tight and you‚Äôll remain in the team,2
"Excuse SRH, meme is our job",3
"Why are they acting like the RRR is 15/16

Its still a pretty achievable target.. No need for stupidity",7
"just something I want to mention here..

Rashid is still 22.. let that sink in..

guy is a legend in T20 already...",3
RCB always find a way to lose don‚Äôt worry,2
This IPL all three matches have been a BRAIN FADE. Top level meme quality,2
Can you believe that Williamson's on the bench watching this chaos,3
[deleted],4
"Some people will say it's bad luck, but as far as I'm concerned if you get out ramping it's your own damn fault.",10
This is just tragic. Should have been an easy win for SRH. Smh,5
Rashid Khad is the youngster they should be excited about!,2
Get fucked again!,3

wow,3
Only srh  can do this.,3
Why are SRH committing ~~seppukku~~ self-RCB-ing,5
This is Rashid khan making his case for the opening slot,2
Dube is a decent looking hardik pandya minus the batting,3
SRH is royally fucked lmao,4
"30 off 19 would be easy for most other teams. More or less confirmed defeat for us, esp with no good bat available.",7
"WTF.

What the actual fuck is happening.",4
Meme run out,3
Oh gosh. Everything is going wrong for SRH,6
Oh wow,4
LMAO WTF,5
Wtf rashid,2
Fuck I hope he's okay,2

"Wow, SRH is self destructing in all freakishly possible ways",2
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not over until it‚Äôs over‚Äù - Kohli, when the opposite team requires 75 off last 4 overs",11
Oh no that looks bad,2
Woeful from srh,2
Ayayayayayay c'mon,0
What the fuck is going on and another injury,3
"Hope he is okay, oh man",1
How abt Koach bowling the 19th over?,4
LOL OMG DEAD,1
What a bunch of imbeciles.,2

The Gods of Cricket want RCB to win this match,14

WHAT THE FUCK MAN,8
Hahahhahhhahhhha,0
Absolute Pandemonium. Collision. I hope Rashid is okay.,8
Oof.,3
Damn not looking good for Rashid,2
Ffs. Cancel the tournament,11
Oh my god,1
what is this game?,3
What happened to watching your partner and run,2
"I don't expect RCB to win at all, I just hope they end up going in the playoffs",9
quarantine affecting cricketers in so many ways.,4
Does dube remind anyone else of the nice but slow kid in school who always had a blocked nose,14
Is this a joke ?,10
That's hilarious,1
"Oh god, our playoff hopes just crashed.",12
lmao this is such meme cricket,5
wtf,1
SRH bottle job? Still don't trust our bowlers to finish this off though,4
SRH going through what RCB usually go through,11
Why would you bowl that lmao,2
"WTH is going on, some kind of kala jaadu as soon as Chahal came back on...",12
What the fuck is happening,7
HahahHahahaha,0
Never play with RCB. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.,49
Scenes if they send Kane as concussion substitute,18
Fuck. That's brutal,6
"How Williamson isn't in this team is beyond me, they need a fucking anchor, Bairstow and Warner carryjob rn.",23
"If RCB manage to pull this off, seeing how Dube's lack of pace is troubling batsmen even on a good pitch, they should bring in Udana and Morris for Finch and Steyn, and Parthiv for Sundar/Umesh.",5
This game has a powerful BBL energy,8
Jeez that's a crash.,4
SRH R u Komedy me?,8
That Face of Perplexion and Shit fuckeryy,4
SRH is literally imploding lol. hope rashids fine.,6
What is happening? A piece of helmet actually broke off.,10
Double whammy,4
Whats with this ipl and people gettinginjured,5
what cursed year seriously,11
Is this a joke,12
CHUMMA DUBE BHAIIYA,8
2 wickets in 1 ball?,6
So the batsman which was slightly okay with collision is out,7
"Kohli: We are asking for suggestions to improve our team.  
  
Warne: Get better bowlers.  
Hussain: You should open.  
Gavaskar: Drop Umesh.  
  
Shoaib Akhtar: KOI DALER BANDA LAO DALERI SE KHELO MAI JAB KHELTA THA TOH DAUD LAGATA THA AUR MERE GHOOTNE TOOT JAATE THAY",38

"Hope he's okay, man! Seems nasty..",2
is Rashid Khan faking ?,4
"Don't show the injured player from the top-down view of the spidercam, you dumbfuck producer.",6
I really hope he is ok that looked like it hurt.,3
Shit... SRH should pull out of tournament now.,3
KYA CHALU HAI BHAI YEEE,5
This is Rashid's fault. Abhishek was going to the danger end.,6
Underage teen getting injured...is this an gentleman‚Äôs sport?,8
Damn this game is taking some turns,7
SRH pulling off an RCB here. What the actual fk.,11
The priceless looks in the SRH dugout. üòÜ,6
That was very brutal collision,11
So already 2 overseas players injured for SRH. Hope Rashid's fine!,10
R/unexpectedgridiron,4
Wow 2 batsmen in one go.,6
Wtf is going on,4
You can‚Äôt script this shit...,6
Jesus fuck.. Meme team gives you a meme filled roller coaster of a match with epic botches and all that jazz. Color me surprised!,7
Holy fuck,2
Both teams trying their best to fuck themselves over,8
Concussion replacement? Nabi? ;),2
Shoulder barge damn,1
Bhuvi about to hit 30 from 5 and win the game,5
real collapse from SRH quite literally,3
Man why is this IPL turning out be a fucking comedy.,6
I really doubt SRH will have playoff hopes after these injuries. Ahhhhhhh sad,2
"3 overs 30 needed? No worries, it's just RCB",4
"And here I was thinking the Blast was the peak of ""professional village cricket""",4
Ugh looks painful,4
"Whoever said collapse.exe 20mins ago, god bless you üôè",3
Oh I thought it was dube,1
Rashid please don't get injured. You're my Fantasy League captain,1
2020 is so wired that even rcb is getting lucky ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,14
Man this shit is scripted. The last 2 wickets are so bizzare,2
The patent on the RCB collapse must have expired,5
Jeez so many injuries in the first three days of IPL,10
SRH really don‚Äôt want to take it deep.,4
"God damn, protect out spinners",6
Hope rashid is ok...too good a player to miss out .,3
"29 of last 3 overs. Oh god Rashid Khan, pls pull something off here.",3
Looks painful when you look at in replay.,8
It‚Äôs like watching dumb n dumber,8
I can't tell which team is RCB here,12
"Wtf just happened, this is a meme game.

Hope Rashid is OK.",9
"If RCB win this, Chahal is the reason for picking Bairstow and Shankar.",9
Proper village cricket,8
"I mean , comeon. Is this IPL about throwing away matches from winning positions.",9
"The last 2 wickets are comical

Feel bad for Rashid though.",10
KANE WILLIAMSON CONCUSSION SUB?,17
.,17
What the actual fuck,8
Hope Rashid is okay and smacks a few sixes for the win.,9
WHAT THE FUCK,3
I dipped out for a couple of minutes what the fuck happened,5
Did the BCCI make a deal with the devil to get this up and running and then rip off the devil or some witches or some shit. This is cursed,9
No social distancing. Smh.,11
Bring Nabi as concussion sub,7
3rd match in & it feels like IPL **2020**,20
Srh doing rcb hahahh,5
"Haunted tournament, lotsa injuries",9
hope rashid wins the emerging player this year.,10
RCB please don't do a Delhi now. It's in the bag,5
[removed],1
He is young,3
Is Rashid okay?,4
Cricket's not good with concussions. Doesn't happen often. He should not be out there,6
"Kanos is inevitable, this comedy from SRH is the world correcting itself.",3
cuncussion?,1
"If Phillpe would have missed collecting that ball, Kohli would have ran up there like Abhishek and gave him the shoulder.",3
Fuck this match! Hope our injured players are okay..,3
13/4 so far... this is impressive,5
Ah man to make that even funnier Josh should have missed the run out,3
"That was so stupid and dangerous.

Look straight, not at ball!!

Hopefully he is OK.",2
"Don't know how they are going to manage it but Kanos is must in these conditions for SRH. He can be the anchor they desperately need. 

It'd be stupid to expect Bairstow and Warner to fire in every match",4
The script for today's game seems really lazy. I want my refund Srini mams,9
Glad Rashid is back on his feet,5
[removed],-1
"3 games,  absolutely the best IPL so far.  Each team wants the other team to win. No u at its best.",37
"Damn gotta feel bad Rashid

Srh needs him to be fit for the next 6 weeks

Retire hurt pls",6
I've seen mix ups where they almost hit each other but never a collision like that. Where were they looking?,7
Rashid and Marsh. Take Proper rest in this match and comeback strong in the next match. - A well wisher.,2
I feel better about supporting Delhi now. There are dumber teams.,7
Where is MMarsh,1
Kanos :You  could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me,6
Chahal casually returning the bat lmao,8
I do think they intersperse some spot fixing with genuine  cricket to make things interesting in these matches.,-2
No jokes--I just hope Rashid is okay.,9
Getting injured at 14. Too young.,6
Fuck these ads man. Show us the fucking match. :/,4
An i wonder what's going on Bairstow and Warner's brain right now. Still shit middle order after all these years.,11
Quality of cricket hasn't been good at all,3
I hope it's not a concussion,2
Lol who is this commentator suggesting concussion protocol only applies f the ball does it?,6
Kohli hates Sundar confirmed,7
If Rashid can't continue can they just have him be the one out?,0
Horrible running by the Abishek. Did he think that Rashid would disappear when he saw him right in front of him?,2
Looked like he would of been run out without the clash!,1
Doesn't josh phillipe look like a young Steve Smith?,3
RCB has decided to pass on their crown to SRH,3
Mentos zindagi >> hosh/josh,5
Everyone and their dog knew SRH had exactly 3 good batsmen and it was a long fucking tail after that. Yet somehow the management thinks it's okay to select a team this weak on the batting front.,9
Abhishek Sharma didn't even bothered to look at Rashid Khan lying painfully in the field. That's no way to treat your fellow teammate.,25
Shivam dube to overstep with 2 needed off 1. You heard it here first,2
"Rashid Concussed, Bring on Nabi, He'll win this.",1
"If they bring Kanos in, I'm going to nut",5
What black magic juju has RCB done,7
Uncles team csk would have stopped with a single and avoided the injury.. big brain time.,6
Man that my 11 ad has some sick beats in the bg,2
"Q. What's your age?

A. 38...CRAP",18
Mannnn.... Birthday boy got **ROCKED**!!!!!!,2
Umpires can't show watch when dealing with concussion.,10
Rashid is hustling,2
">Can already see how this match is going to go. Bairstow will singlehandedly keep us on track with the asking rate while other around him just suck up deliveries. Then he'll eventually get out and we'll crumble and fall well short of the target.

IPL 2020: try your best to lose,6
Why didn‚Äôt srh take Abdul samad the guy can really smoke the ball,2
"That collision actually sent Rashid back in time, so he‚Äôs 16 now",7
Umpires being such aholes. The guy could bloody die ffs,3
Teams heavily dependent on top three somehow manage to find Vijay Shankar in them,8
Just how many brands is Canada Kumar promoting these days?,0
How does rashid at 19 have so much facial hair?,3
Watch on Star Sports Select no ads no BS,3
"I simply cannot understand what SRH were thinking at the auction. Did they forget the important of a middle order in t20 cricket ?! You need someone with experience to handle the pressure of middle order batting, not a whole bunch of unproven teenagers. Yes it‚Äôs good long term but this is the IPL",6
Maybe Kane will make it in the next match. This batting lineup is lighter than Chahal's weight.,26
SO the better batsman is out and the other one is injured. Its over for SRH today.,3
Man the break is too long. I hope he's okay.,6
Bhuvi in? Then what about Mitch?,2
The commentators on the dugout are woefully uninformed about the rules - why am I surprised.,3
He needs just to get off if he can't play.,2
Both sides desperately trying to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.,7
abhishek sharma ruining this first by fielding and now crashing.,5

Will marsh come out ?,2
Marsh can stand and smash surely.,4
"The fuck? You can't know if someone has a concussion immediately, which is why the concussion protocol exists. What's the point of it if you just listen to the player go ""i'm feeling ok"".....players will not know if they're concussed.",12

"I don't care about the result, just end this quick",2
This IPL is literally turning out to be a competition of who can prove themselves to be the worse team,7
BRING IN KANOS,1
That bouncer though..lol,5
Ruthless Saini...love it,3
Saini do not shit talk Rashid mate. He does have the ability to go bonkers,7

RCB trying their hardest to throw hahaha,3

You know what? It‚Äôs good this shit show is happening in the first match. Hopefully the management can see through. I hope they‚Äôre embarrassed enough.,7
You fucking idiot,3
This is what happens when Kane is not in the team. Seems he's the one that brings all the luck to the team :(,1

Fuck off Kohli you moaning cunt.,-2
Saini in the way to be the next lord,2
Who is this idiot masquerading as a bowler?,3

Looks like its RCB's turn to self destruct now.,9
"Fuck, don't bottle this too now",6
Can we have meme name for Capton + coach + umpire,4
He looks disoriented!!,7
Rcb force trying to lose this,2

Sab khud kai laude laga rahe hai,7
"Deserved that, fuck bowling bouncers to someone who just got hit in the head.",4
Nah dont tell me we lose like this,7
Kohli being a d---head again.,8
"Aggression runs in RCB's veins. 

Captain leading from the front.",8
much respect to rashid for staying out there but is it really worth it in the 1st match? go take some rest.,5
Neither team deserves to win this,8
Can't believe Philippe didn't grow wings and fly to take that smfh,7
Saini: ima aim at the head bc hes already damaged,15
Calm down Saini.,2
There go RCB's fairplay award chances lol,11

"Yes virat do that.

Kohli cam is best,2
‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs your captain but he‚Äôs a shit bloke.‚Äù,5
"If ishant can't play in Australia, we should pick Saini instead of Yadav",3
How is that one for the over if Rashid ducked while blindly putting his bat in the way,1
"Guys im gonna say the S word

SUPER OVER",11
This game and the last game has been more about both teams trying to lose,8
What a time to give freebies,4
"When all hope is lost, RCB finds a way to lose",5
Yorkers pls,1
I wouldn't complain if Warner comes back somehow.,1
Yuzi plunking down the long barrier lmao,2
Match is literally been put into hands of RCB gawd this team,3

Want SRH to win as a neutral. Will surve sweet poetic justice!,10
Meme of the year,1
MM in the dug outüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,3
Shouldn't RR be playing KKR?,2
"That ball was going to be a wide no matter where Rashid was standing, what the hell is this guy talking about?",2
Yeesss Mitch is a tough nut,3
Well Marsh has padded up atleast,4
Why do bowlers like bowling short to tail Ender's?,1
Mitchy is back to do a kedar jadhav vs mi 2018 opener,17
Aussie toughness coming up,9
ah shit.. mitch marsh all padded up..kahani mein twist hai abhi..,7
Bhuvi get fucked,0
Yeah this is not good,2
Looks like MM still limping.,3
Get yorked bitches.,2
Pure cricket,5
"""mitch Marsh padded up!""

Maro mujhe bhai maro",9
"Bhuvi got out on purpose because he saw Marsh padded up

Tactical masterclass",10
Saini when he bowls properly is a beauty,2
2 more wickets guys,1
[deleted],2
Marsh will end this now,1
Paul Bearer brought back Marsh,3
Shouldn't have tried that waste bouncer,2
"Bhuvneshar needs to sacrifice his wicket now that Marsh is padded up

Edit: And he did.",3
"More than a live match discussion, this looks like a watch party discussion. It is so fun.
P.s. I don't intend to offend anyone.",3
Kohli needs t3o learn from Captain Cool. He whines a lot with RCB. He's better with India.,4
"YES THIS IS GOOD

But m Marsh is coming now right?",1
"Ah fuck bad wicket

Marsh padded up",2
Genuinely what was Kohli moaning about?,8
Yes!!! Wicket,1
"Wait, is Mitch Marsh padding up ? No please no",2
"This might be a good thing for srh, marsh in",3
I'm speed baby,1
Bhuvi throwing it away for Marsh to come and finish it.,6
"Just for future reference in this IPL: if you start to wonder why a certain bowler is not bowling or a batsman not coming in to bat, just assume they were injured.",10
"Its still anyones game. RCB bowling looks just ok. Chahal is great, Steyn still has it but Dube as 5th bowler is risky against great teams. But today they will squeak through as SRH looks weaker.",6
Why tf is williamson padded up.,5
Fuck no Mitch is coming on,2
Save us Marsh,3
Why did he have to be so aggressive in the beginning,5
"Damn. Yall weren't kidding about the SRH tail. 

Desperately need Kanos in the lineup.",12
"Perfect seam, length and just too quick for Bhuvi",10
"147kph yorker. 

Guys we have a true right arm fast",12
Lol sandeep sharma,4
Get it done Mitch,3
So Rashid will not get strike now and just watch this collapse,1
"**17.4** Saini to Kumar, OUT, **knocks the middle stump out!** Full, straight, too fast for Bhuvi. Top class. **141-7**

B Kumar  b Saini 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",3
BAH GAWD MARSH IS BACK!!!,4
Scenes if Marsh takes us home,6
Still no Marsh,3
"Bhuvi's batting has fallen off a cliff, tbh.",4
Watching SRH's middle order is like watching Aus's middle order. FFS I watch IPL to get away from it not be reminded of collapses every time.,7
Eat shit! Kohli shithousery works for the bowlers from Delhi!,3
Come on I want a hattrick from dube,7
Ohhh that was awesome,1
Marsh won‚Äôt come right? Please Marsh take rest. There are no Heroes in Cricket. It‚Äôs just a game. - Genuine Well Wisher.,11
"Dandi gul 
               . Gavaskar 2020",2
Saini looking like and built like a young Ashish Nehra,3
People actually think Mitch Marsh can win this?,8
"KP - ""Mitch Marsh is next in, but let's not talk about him. Let's talk about RCB and Virat"" 

Lmao. Totally being neutral here",10
Saini clocking almost 150kph ... *pace is pace yaar*,2
Bhuvi used to bat 5-6 in up ranji...since India debut batting gone downwards.. courtesy sanjay bangar batting coach :d,4
[deleted],3
"Saini is bowling mid 140s without much effort. 

Wild stuff for an Indian fast bowler",11
Sandy,1
SRH still have a chance as long as Rashid is there tho. He could chase about 12-15 runs in the last over given the dearth of death bowling options for RCB,2
Marsh is not in wtf ??,3
"Everyone expecting marsh to come, here comes the Sandeep lol",3
Saini has strengthened RCB bowling since last season.,2
It will be so typical of us to lose this now to 2 injured batsmen,2
"Ugh Marsh gonna finish it up, fuck me",2
My boi Marsh will finish it in 4 balls,4
SRH giving RCB a run for their money this season lol,2
It's like no team wants to win this season,5
"Marsh just stick till last ball 

Rcb will gift the game by then.",5
"Yoooo this match reminds me of that match against MI in which Stanlake scored the winning runs. Low-ish target, start okay, then implode. Scraped through there, hopefully do here as well",2
M Marsh gonna pull some Lagaan Ismail shit,2
This is a proper choke...and I should know as a Proteas fan.,1
"Sharma in, not Marsh?

Marsh is their last resort to stand and deliver then 

Prob can't run at all",3
I suspect marsh is coming in for the inevitable washington sundar over which might be the last one.,5
I was promised Marsh,3
"Would have sent Mitch Marsh just to pinch hit, get out and deliver now and get the rr down",2
story of every year for SRH.,2
The main pressure in games vs RCB comes from what will 4 people say if you lose to RCB,7
"SRH won't be that concerned with that wicket , need to get Rashid out",3
Lol. Dube‚Äôs got one over left.,4
"Mitch didn't come in, they sent Sandeep in. We still have hope.",7
Waiting for Marsh to pull out a GREAME SMITH here,7
"It's interesting that the great Dale Steyn was at no point on long on/off to help either Umesh or Saini. Ofc, Koach knows better humming to the bowler",0
Bhuvi be like main shunya pe sawar hu.,4
Mitch will come at the end,1
THANK GOD,2
"C'mon RCB don't get Sandeep out now, M marsh is waiting",2
What,1
WHY IS SANDY HERE,5
"Virat has gone for

Saini
Steyn
Dubey 

Instead of 
Dubey
Saini
Steyn

Not sure if it's the right choice.",1
why am I getting so worked up over SRH fucking hell,6
So no Mitch?,2
"Lmao what was that look Bairstow was giving Marsh, like a mix of pity and condescension",9
Sandeep Sharma ready to do a shardul thakur,4
"Uhhj. I was promised Marsh.

Fuck is Sandeep out here for?",7
~~Batdeep~~ Sandeep,6
"Yesterday Stoinis and today hopefully Marsh.
No SRH, no RCB but the Australians are the happiest rn lol",7
Marsh is ready to bat,8
Just need RCB to pull a punjab here,4
All Rashid's gotta do now is see off Steyn's final over and inshallah and swing in Dube's,8
Would have been perfect over if not for that wide four,9
Saini you beauty üòö,3
Get fucked Rashid,1
> Sandeep Sharma comes out. Presumably because Mitch Marsh cannot run and is likely being saved to stand at one end and look for boundaries if needed.,2
Saini is a dangerous bowler.,3
I'm sorry guys. I jinxed Rashid.,6
Fuckin unreal,5
who would've thought!,1
"Has a 144KPH Yorker

Bowls a leg side bouncer to a tail ender

agGResSIoN",8
Lol this is amazing.,4
Saini you beauty!!,6
r/deathrattleporn AHHHHHHHHHH THIS IS AWESOME,5
Oh you beautiful beautiful man!!,4
"Saini

Why tf are you bowling well at the death for RCB? Need some memes",6
"win or lose.. please play Mooen and Morris next match..
absolutely makes no sense not selecting them..

and replace Sundar with Gurkeerat u have a good team..",4
What's the point of Washington when he bowled only 1 over,5
"Saini is elite, man!",5
Should have bought Mitch in now if he can't run. Give him a sighter than leg him have a swing.,2
fuck YES,3
Bumrah and Saini in the national team is looking tasty.,8
Umesh bowling next wud have been fun,6
2FAST4U,8
Better take kane in the next match. That guy carried you to the finals all by himself and they have literally no respect for him,10
Yes this is death bowling,6
God this hurts.,8
Saini on fucking fire,4
I won't be surprised if RCB bottles it up from here.,8
Daddy Saini üòçüòç,7
"There is no substitute to pace!!

Two cracking deliveries.",3
SRH would probably be better off batting first so they don't choke,3
YESSSSS,2
"If you can bowl like this, why were you bowling bouncers?",7
Saini is the lord now.,5
"Probably best to bowl full now and rely on pace, rather than length. Especially with tailenders at the crease.",1
Marsh padded up. Shouldn't have done that. Should not have done that,3
That was a beauty! Kohli motivation works!!,5
Boobie is amazing!,3
"Well SRH fans, you get your wish-Marsh is in",5
Saini . What a spell !!! Most exciting Indian fast bowler in future,6
"This is it guys, THE ULTIMATE MEME",3
Death rattle porn from a young Indian FAST bowler ... gazab,11
"Yay wicket!
Fuck they just brought Marsh to strike",3
"IPL is not RCB vs other teams for RCB

it's Saini and Chahal vs. Umesh",32
Saini has been very good. He's not too far from a test call up.,11
Dim the lights and play Mitchell Marsh's music as he hobbles out to bat you cowards.,9
Mitch marsh will come at no.11 with 18 required from 6 balls.,6
So we will see Mavi and Nagarkoti?,7
"BC YES YES FUCK YES RASHID IS OUT

HOPES ARE ALIV

wait fuck that means Marsh is coming",2
"**17.6** Saini to Rashid Khan, OUT, **tonks off stump!** **142-8**

Rashid Khan  b Saini 6 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120.00",1
"Dw, Mitch Marsh will tonk a few sixes and get it done with",1
I had completely forgotten how big of a beast Saini is...,5
"Oh Saini, Boobie and Bumrah. Top bowling if you ask me.",4
Goddamn... RCB are going to win this aren't they! Hoooly moly!,5
"Finally RCB has a balanced bowling side? Yuzi, Saini, Steyn are top class",3
"Marsh visibly limping

Brave of him to come out",4
"Pack it up guys, we're done here",6
SRH still favorites here tbh,4
"Nice, we have a very decent chance now. Thank you SRH.",6
Saini you legend.,3
Absolute beauties from Saini,3
Kohlapse,3
"Ok now unless marsh walks in ,RCB are there",4
Assault and Battery alert,4
Wtf Marsh its the first game take a break,7
some brilliant reverse swing action from Saini.. love it..,2
Huge props to Mitch for still coming out. Gg,6
Saini looks more like a 22-year old than Rashid,1
what a weird year rcb are actually bowling well,3
More choking happening here than an erotic asphyxiation convention,4
It's not over until it's over. Especially with RCB.,5
Noooo.,1
Lord Umesh: Saini Bro thats what Ive wanted to do with my pace for 7+ years,3
Bloke can barely walk,8
Rcb found a death bowler guys. 2020 is truly cursed,10
Marsh is on non striker end,6
"Fast ball hitting top of off stump. 

That was quite simply out of Rashid's syllabus.",2
Few sixes from MM is gonna wrap the game.,1
Ye Navdeep Saini nahi Sainik hai is team ke - Aakash Chopra,9
"Still think there's hope

Umesh still to bowl?",3
Some collapse this,4
Fuck. It's Marsh.,7
Give 1 over to Lord Umesh so we can take it to super overs.,1
Since RCB is playing here. It‚Äôs still anybody‚Äôs game.,11
Inb4 Marsh comes and hits 4 sixes next over,6
Brisbane Sunrisers Heatrabad,6
RCB venturing into unfamiliar territories here. The feel of victory,13
Chad Saini cleaning up the tail with 140+ yorkers.,3
"121/3 to 142/8 
Just SRH middle order things.",7
The great mitch march master plan coming together ladies and gents,2
And Maaaaarsh has done it.,4
Does SRH have the longest tail?,3
Bison doesn't use his feet anyway,6
Not worth it Marsh. Think about your career.,9
Mitch hobbling,3
I love you saini,2
Marsh limping out to deliver the goods,6
Why no runner for mitch?,1
Rcb probably gonna have to bowl dube in the last over.. Srh still in this,1
"Fucking hell RCB are winning by Bowling second 

2020 is something else innit",6
"SRH have two overseas players injured so I guess Williamson gets a chance in the next game, which will give them 4 batsmen instead of three",10
Virat playing with marsh,8
Saini is the real deal,4
SRH lost 6 wickets in last 18 balls...,3
Smart to see out saini.,2
"Wow! Fuck this match, Marsh is my hero now.",2
Kohli did that deliberately lol,3
"Jeez, Marsh really needs a runner",1
"Marsh doesnt look fit, he's gonna want to smash boundaries to avoid sprinting",4
Him limping makes him more dangerous,1
He's hobbling to strike. Finish it Marsh.,3
Guys RCB can be unbeatable if they bring Morris instead of Phillipe and Parthiv in place of Sundar who bowled just one over. Morris > Umesh,5
Mitch seriously should've taken rest man.,4
Dube‚Äôs over..... I‚Äôve got Benny hill music all loaded for the next farcical moment....,3
Poor marsh,3
Feels bad looking at Marsh limping. Ouch!,4
This is first time r/cricket is happy to see Mitch Marsh,9
Kohli fAkE fIeLdInG,3
Navdeep Saini had been RCB's best performing bowler along with Chahal from last two editions of IPL.,7
damn its bad seeing marsh like this. WTF srh management?!,11
"Watching Marsh walk, hurts me",2
Looks like Kohli deliberately let that go to entice them to go for the second.,1
Kohli you bully,1
Why won't you give Steyn this over!!,0
Anyone backing Mitch marsh to finish game here and now ?,2
I hope Mitch is out- for his sake,1
Kohli tempting the second run there,1
Runner not allowed?,1
Looks like marsh is gonna be ruled out of the series. Last nail in the coffin.,6
Why risk Marsh‚Äôs rest of the tournament for one silly first match?!,5
"The man,the myth,the legend comes in for SRH",1
Bruh why would Marsh risk it for an IPL match,2
Why didnt kohli bowl this over?,2
Now watch big Mitch hit 4 6s off Dube,2
Nice guy Kohli allowing Marsh to hobble over,2
Cheeky Virat misfielding deliberately,2
"It took years, but we did it r/cricket...we memed RCB to be good.",8
Why tf is IPL so addictive ?,6
"Jesus, he is really struggling just to hobble to the other end",4
Why is Dubey bowling the 19th over?,1
SRH batting makes me want to fucking kill myself,2
5 runs penalty for fake fielding Virat :p,8
It hurts to see marsh hobble,1
What these IPL matches have taught is that the set batsman should just finish the match. Thank you Faf. Sorry  Mayank and Bairstow,4
Should have bowled Steyn here,1
If only Yadav bowled well AHHHH,1
No runner for Marsh?,1
Koach harami,2
"Besides umesh, Rcb's bowling looks pretty good",1
Dubey bowling the 19th over? What am I watching?,1
Elite miss feilding,3
"That was so cunty by Kohli, I hope Marsh smashes few sixes",4
Marsh to cunt 4 sixes here and finish it off,1
Why hasn't he got a runner?,1
Marsh would be faster hopping on one leg,5
Please let Marsh copy Stoinis for the memes.,5
I don't have a good feeling about this. Why would you go out in this condition? Don't you wanna play the rest of the season?,2
Want to see Umesh yell Bhenchod at Kohli for misfielding and I can die in peace,6
The only person who looks calm in RCB is Finch,5
SRH shouldn't have allowed Rashid to keep batting. It was reckless,8
Lol. Commentators are already assuming RCB are winning. 13 years it‚Äôs been. They learnt nothing.,11
"Last ~~19~~ 20 balls, 22 runs and ~~6~~ 7 wickets",5
SRH choking harder than my girl Lana Rhoades did in that gangbang video I saw the other day!,4
Still having flashbacks of Kedar Jadhav limping out to beat us 2 seasons ago.,11
"~ Crazy collapse from SRH ~ - get fucked commentator, don't make it seem like a happy occasion",6
"Rcb wtf you guys upto, it's winning time play hard guys.",8
Out! Take rest Mitch,7
Fuck yeah,3
Reminds me of Jadhav in the first match of last ipl,4
"team is looking close to average at least. Hopefully, Kohli is in good form and today was just bad luck. Can try for play offs at least if we can get it together.",3
Why no steyn for 19th. Koach making this interesting,3
Surely its done right.....?,5
Dube can get wrecked all around if he doesn't bowl properly,6
He tried. Mitch you're a hero,11
Oh man fuck me.,2
Sad end to Mitchell marsh IPL,2
Shouldn't have come out risking the injury,12
Poor Mitch :(,5
"I don't like marsh out there, hope the injury doesn't get worst",6
Dubey > Umesh,6
Let us not act like this is some alien thing. We SRH fans are very much used to this,3
Sad. He tried his best.,18
Aww man..,8
"Poor Marsh

Hobbles out in real pain only to get out for a golden duck

Probably shouldn't have come out at all",6
Marsh has my respect.,18
THIS IS AWESOME!,-1
"Welp, I guess he didn't need a runner after all",2
"Ah man, gotta feel for my boy Marsh here",15
The Aussie players and Steyn all ran upto him to help him.,13
"fuck man, look at marsh jeez",12
"What is this strange feeling

Is this happiness?",10
This is sad,8
Bruh dubey to marsh is not good.,4
Finch trying to increase Fairplay point.,18
Dude this is really stupid.,1
We are actually winning this shit ( this is not a meme),9
Oh man. That‚Äôs a sad sight to see :((,16
Whatever be said... Bravo Marsh for making that effort in this condition.,31
"Idiotic and classless move, SRH",9
*sad hyderabad noises*,8
"Well, GG.",3
Shouldn't have sent him in  painful to watch,7
Damn thats so painful to watch ;_;,10
[deleted],2
Shit decision by SRH to play Marsh,14
That was just cruel from SRH!,10
Bloke came out all the way to bat to get out on the very first ball. Respect.,8
[removed],-21
Not worth the injury...bad from SRH,13
i mean why the fuck would staff even send mitch back lol stupid,13
Why even risk aggravating an injury for a lost cause match?,13
Poor Mitch,6
Really bad management by srh,13
Oooof man,6
Not good on SRH to send Marsh. He is clearly hurting.,3
He needs a stretcher.,5
Mad respect to the man,9
Why the fuck did SRH send Marsh in despite his injury. Could worsen his injury.,11
Finch genuinely looking concerned.,8
Respect for trying Mitch dude ...not your day though.,11
Runner ka rule nhi htana chahiye tha,1
Finch and Phillipe rightfully concerned. What was Dave thinking?,7
Why's everyone here acting like an injured Marsh is the second coming of Bevan,6
Massive respect for mitch,6
"Shouldn't have him go out there, might've aggravated that injury",15
"Gotta feel terrible for Marsh, hope he can recover soon",8
"Lady luck finally smiles on RCB.
Good for them to start with a win.",9
Man be like I'll do it geez.,2
Finch thought about carrying Mitch back and noped the fuck out when he remembered he's half his size lol,22
Finchy instantly going to MM after he got out.,12
Respect for Marsh,8
"Very bad stuff by SRH management to send him out, worsen his injury",10
Atleast he tried.,9
"Really feel bad for SRH, Mitch & Rashid.",8
What the hell from SRH management to even send him out to bat like that?,14
SRH need Kane,3
Man it feels sad watching Marsh limping back to pavillion,14
That was hard to watch,12
"Ah looks bad, good on you marsh to come out and bat.",10
Total shithousery from SRH management this,7
"This IPL is sad, this is just sad.",3
Mad respect for Mitchell Marsh for trying to score some runs when he clearly is in so much pain.,14
"Marsh looks angry than sad!!

Poor dude, hope he recovers quickly.",9
Srh management üëèüëèüëè,8
Jeez 7-22 is quite the collapse,6
Respect to Marsh. Toughed it out and tried to give it a go.,12
This has been a crazy game. Srh imploding this way.,5
GG,1
Feeling bad for Marsh. Hoped he recovers and does well in IPL.,6
FFS why send Marsh out when he's that injured. Take care of your damn players,11
Poor marsh man,1
Why did they remove runners?,0
"**18.2** Dube to Marsh, OUT, **holes out to long-on.** Smart bowling from Dube. Making him fetch that from outside off, because foot movement is out of the question. **143-9**

MR Marsh c Kohli b Dube 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
Bravest golden duck I've ever witnessed,11
That is not a good sight. He shouldn't even be batting.,3
The game is done ... not sure why they risked Marsh at this stage. Stupid,3
If he wasn't injured that would be 6,2
"That was not needed, to send out an injured cricketer. 

Really? SRH? 
Where is the physio?",7
Fabian Allen or Nabi in for next games pleaseee,1
SRH shouldn't have sent Marsh in.,5
T Natarajan - Remember the name,2
"Fucking Mitch Marsh take a bow son, big balls coming out like that",8
üò° Why risk injuring him further?,3
Stupid audience shouting kohli kohli ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,4

just realized ! tomorrow its the pensioners vs students,3
[deleted],3
Uno reverse card in this match,5
2020 is fucking weird time line where RCB is not the team who collapses...,1
Wow. How did the physio even okay sending him there,7
I hope he recovers soon. Can't have his injury on our conscience! Feel like we've aggravated it already.,1
Mitch just made a new 100 million fans. Respect.,4
"2020 is still not normal

Strange to see rcb not bottling n lord umesh not bowling in death.",1
Laadu samplee,2
Man seems like no matter what marsh does he can't catch a break. Gotta commend how he never stops trying,7
"feeling it for Marsh, get well soon buddy! you did well",2
Fun Fact: T Natarajan is reincarnation of Don Bradman,5
[proper collapse from srh](https://imgur.com/a/egONvKh),1
These fake sounds are such a turn off,3
IPL INDIAN PAIN LEAGUE,4
Marsh was the last resort in a comfortable chase and SRH middle order made sure we resort to it.,5
Why even bother sending M.Marsh? Like what is the point of aggravating the injury in the very first game and probably ending his run for this IPL. So selfish. Hardly a winnable position to take such a risk.,6
"SRH boys come around for a group hug, we really need it",7
At this point SRH at least play out 20 overs,3
Why is danny de vito smiling when Mitch is internally crying,1
"Sunrisers,remember, we just need to win 8 to 9 games to get into playoffs.  We can sacrifice a few here and there for the Gods. GG RCB.",3
Western Australia's Marsh One Day Cup defence in shambles,5
This batting lineup needs Williamson.,4
Scenes if Natrajan hits consecutive boundaries,2
We fucked up but wouldn't read into this loss too much. Losing an all-rounder without him bowling a single over was a big blow. Losing a batsman in him when we already have such a thin batting lineup was even more of a loss. Marsh is no mug with the bat in T20s,9
fucking psychopathic crowd chanting RCB instead of Marsh,10
Saini & Chahal : 8-0-43-5.,8
"Marsh trying to hit here is more important than winning this match.

SRH should be happy that they have atleast a couple strong, dedicated fighters for the team - Rashid and Marsh",6
"Why the fuck would you play him, you twats.",3
"Poor marsh, hope he's ok",4
Only Umesh Yadav can win it from here,9
It takes some special skills to collapse against RCB‚Äôs bowling. Well done SRH !!,11
"Fuck off , get fucked by a cactus SRH management .",3
Shit on dube more? ü§£,4
"So you need Warner to get out like that, Marsh half dead, and one of most dumbass planned batting in a while for RCB to win!",6
Last 5 overs- 41/7. Sums it up really,10
Are all physios bald ?,11
SRH just needs to get Williamson in somehow. Their middle order just falls apart.,13
Couldn't they have assigned a runner for Mitch Marsh? Or is that only in test matches?,2
"SRH did a RCB. Wierd Team selection. Batting too top heavy. Thank God for Covid 19, Don't have to endure RCB fans.",4
SRH has a non-existent middle order. a vacuum between the top order and the tailenders.,2
u/banrepcfoo Told you we will win,1
Why are injured players still playing?? What dogshit management. Winning isn‚Äôt more important than their health and fitness.,7
"Good thing about RCB matches is that you either see what the opposition is capable of at their peak performance, or you witness an upset",10
RCB defending an average total is peak 2020,25
Kane wouldn't have done this. Warner is a horrible person and this proves it again.,3
How shit a batsman do you have to be to come after injured Rashid and Mitch?,-2
SRH letting Rashid and Marsh bat despite their injuries is bit of a disgrace.,5
Kohli celebrating catch of a wound up marsh in an already won match. I see why people find it hard to support him sometimes.,21
Sandeep averages 16 with highest score of 13,12
Why the hell marsh came out to bat?,8
With this win clearly kohali>>>>>rohit,8
Terrible choice by SRH for sending him to bat. Respect for Marsh for going,15
I get a feeling SRH will be the worst team this season,5
Fuck off SRH team management,4
Don't think Australian management will be happy at them sending Marsh out to bat in that state. Might not be the last we hear about it.,10
"My KKR bois better wrap themselves in bubble wrap, we cant afford any injuries. No back ups.",8
"If they can produce this consistently, then the only thing RCB need to do is sort their brilliant batting order",8
This is NOT a drill. RCB are winning.,11
I donno about you but Yuzzi boy - the DM boy should be MOTM.,5
RCB DEFENDING OMFG 2020 BOISSSSSS,9
Why is Marsh putting his career on the for IPL?,6
Bairstow caused the landslide lmao,12
Are we into 2021 already? :P,4
"Now that's what you call, a collapse",3
Can we have that meme of *call the ambulance* but *not for me *,5
we can't lose it from here.. right.. right.. !?,5
Rcb fans got nothing to celebrate yet. SRH is just a shambolic team,4
Dube protecting Steyn/s,3
Cricbuzz down holy shit,2
RCB bowling well in the death is peak 2020.,11
"We all knew, after 1,2 and 3 there was nothing for SRH.",8
Why are SRH risking aggravating the conditions of Marsh and Rashid? TF is their management doing?,24
The crowd noise isn‚Äôt as egregious as the first game at least,3
Yo rcb you can bowl like usual if you still don't want it,7
"\*   rcb wins  \*


r/cricket : did we just loose?",8
"RCB is winning

Huh Its 2020",10
Take your lesson SRH and play Williamson in the next match,10
Thakur should summon himself here,4
[deleted],2
Our middle order decided to collapse in the death overs and not the middle overs. Now that‚Äôs improvement.,7
"What a day. Everything that could go wrong for srh went wrong. First that freak injury to marsh and then the unlucky Warner wicket, abhishek and rashid colliding ending with abhishek getting out, rashid getting injured. The only thing which was usual was Vijay disappointing us",20
Fuck now don't tell me they will smash a few boundaries and win it,3
I‚Äôm just concerned we might get royally fucked like this tomorrow,3
SRH look like a sorry unit. Bar the openers the rest of the batting is useless.,14
I don't wish for any player to get injured. But this might be blessing in disguise for SRH. Nabi should be playing from now on.,6
You either die a villian or you live long enough to see yourself becoming a hero.Brave from M Marsh.,5
This entire match was cursed.,16
Uh how did Warner agree to send Marsh in to bat?,8
Basically SRH is Indian ODI team so heavily dependent on top 3 lmao,8
What we are winning this (‡≤• Õú ñ‡≤•). Unbelievable.,6
T Natarajan gonna hit 4 consecutive sixes. EZ GG SRH .,8
Badly missing KW,2
Cricbuzz severe crash ?,3
"Kohli wins in IPL 2020: 1

Rohit wins in IPL 2020: 0

Need I say more",7
Do you guys see kane coming in? This middle order needs him,1
Bairstow: mehnat barbad bc,12
"We need Kanos. Not only as a player, but also as a calming influence. Need his Zen energy.",7
Fabian in next game for marsh. Only player in the squad who is a specialist late middle order player and a power hitter,5
If they just had one frontline batsment they would have a chance,3
We're winning the league ~~^(/s)~~,8
Dube with godly 2/15 in 3 overs.,7
Warner and Jonny sitting like divorced parents in thier childs PTA meeting,12
"Somewhere in a corner , umesh yadav is thanking his stars for today.",4
Thus begins the legendary death bowling career of Shivam Dube.,9
knowing rcb were about to witness sandeep becoming andre russell,8
KW is must in the team :(,4
Umesh gets fucked every year but stil RCB keeps him,5
The smell of RCB victory in the first game is just 2020 thing,10
"So many CSK salty supporters, can't digest RCB win",12
Indian Punter League,2
My motm is Shivam Dube for not bottling at the end,5
Natarajan batting better than Shankar,4
Is it true that RCB are going to win a match? I heard the rumours but didn't believe them.,9
When you have supported rcb for so long. You still worry about this last over,11
Just go home boys. No need to draw this out for another over.,6
"It's RCB. You never, ever, know",14
"SRH middle and lower order real paper thin

youngsters are fine but they need some experience in there to guide them",3
Kohli should have bowled,2
Dale's gonna hit bullseye,1
IPL is an exhibition of how to throw games away so far lol.,5
RCB match aficionados know that the game isn't over until SRH is all out no matter who's batting or bowling.,8
Srh last in the table surely,3
"All this started when YJB decided to hit a bowler he was struggling against, in his last over",9
Chahal has to be the man of the match.,3
"This loss is necessary for SRH. Don't want that overconfident management to paper the cracks with Warner, Bairstow and Pandey. Getting over smart in auctions and always going for gazillion average bowlers and cheap ass middle order batsmen. They managed to ruin a very good team.",16
3 sixes yay or nay?,2
6 balls 18 needed. Steyn is like main karega.,3
"Honestly wtf is this srh lineup, any match either one of warner or bairstow fail to score and its looking like an instant loss",5
Only if Srh has some good batsman like Kane Williamson.,25
Chahal MoM,5
RCB winning #just2020things,8
RCB missing a trick by not bowling Sundar in the powerplay. I remember him being so effective in that period specially in that series where he won Man of the Series.,10
Srh has a top 3 and then a literal tail lol,12
Kohali should ball the last over.... He didn't do much  with bat,5
Yesss RR TOMORROW!,3
"If this leads to no change in RCB line up, Punjab would be the happiest with this win.",3
Something shifted in 2020....im manifesting rcb winning the tournament this year you never know,3
This season is going to be really interesting with the unique conditions! Only the 3D teams will succeed. Can't predict anything,4
So... SRH lost their first game vs RCB in 2016,5
9 wickets down and RCB not yet confident about winning say's a lot about the team,7
VK setting field for Natarajan. He knows the threat,3
Surely dale wont rcb meme this,5
**BRING WILLIAMSON BACK**,6
Man Steyn can get hit for six straight sixes and I'll still love watching him bowl.,1
SRH gotta bring back Kane 1down to support the batting order. Or else playoffs are a lost cause,2
Letting Dube go for just 15 in three overs is criminal,7
Warner can make all the tick toks or videos of his childern but it won't change the fact that he is a horrible person.,-8
"RCB have now got their winning formula complete.

Follow-through Injury, follow-through runout,Collison runout, repeat.",12
In b4 Natarajan hammers Steyn for 3 sixers,4
Kanos: I'm inevitable.,3
"I like how everyone here is saying that SRH has a thin batting lineup as if we weren't literally one batsman short. Marsh averages 30 in T20s, which is extremely solid for a middle order bat.",3
Everyone talking about Kanos but Nabi is needed to balance this team,3
Oh yeah quantum of loss must be minimized,2
MoM should go to Chahal.,4
This match's highlights deserves the Benny Hill theme.,5
Hopefully Smith is fit for tomorrow.,3
What does KP have against headbands?,7
Stehn hasn't given up on the RCB ways,6
[deleted],4
If we lose this game I‚Äôm not supporting RCB ever again,1
Just put Warner in middle order and open with Rashid.,10
Haven't been able to watch this 2nd innings. What's been Steyn's pace?,1
"We can safely say that, 2020 is wired. Now teams are choking against rcb",7
"Mayank ü§ùBairstow

Having teams that shit the bed",6
Should've been no ball,1
complete shithousery from SRH btw,6
Srh should just declare after the top batting order is done and save their bowlers from injuries.,9
Right that's it. Given the way the year has gone I'm off to stick a ton on RCB winning it.,7
That was close to being a no ball?,2
SRH lineup without Williamson is looking worse than KKR's lineup.,7
"Respect to Dube, I didn't believe in him because of his lack of pace but he's bowled well",7
Isn't Steyn like 57 years old now ?,9
Menon *will* get punched if he makes stupid calls today,3
Vijay shankar's wicket is unacceptable. That is where it all started,19

NO BC YE KYA HO GYA,2
sweating intensifies,3
Feels like they're winning this despite Koach's captaincy,6
I'm sure Kohli's gigantic ego will make him believe that this win was somehow because RCB played better,8
Two more sixes needed.,6
They might lose yet.,2
Scenes if Sandeep summons his inner Carlos,6
Dumb luck there,0
"Goddamn it SRH , get another 7 atleast for my sake",3
*RCB flashbacks*,9
Steyn has been so shit today,4

You can see Kohli dying inside as soon as that ball hit fence.,4

Atleast salvaged some NRR.,8
"3 matches so far in the ipl

3 players injured (ashwin, marsh , rashid)

Holy shit! We won our first game. GG üëè,11

Now they have both lost a game and a player. Not to mention at the expense of Marsh's health.",23
"*RCB wins one game*

Comm box: Is this RCB‚Äôs year?",13
RCB making a comeback with the ball and causing a collapse is the least likely way anybody would have thought they would win lol,10
Chahal and Saini won us the game.,10
"Well.. Kudos to RCB for winning.. But, SRH has perhaps the shittiest batting order in the tournament and they still lost just by 10 runs.. RCB bowling and fielding still needs a workaround.",22
Srh and kxp are the meme teams for 2020. Damn that collapse was painful to watch.,5
Do something for the Umesh Yadav problem next match.,7
Marsh fit and this game would have gone totally the other way,5
This fucking commentator says ‚Äúoh 6!‚Äù Giving me a heart attack for nothing,24
That wasn't a good over tbh from Dale. Luckily he was bowling to 10 and 11.,14
Victory was not that satisfying,8
"Its 2020, RCB gonna win it all",6
Respect to Sandeep for trying to still win,16
Good win for RCB. Mumbai and CSK are confirmed for the playoffs. Will be a good fight between the other 6 teams for the 2 positions.,7
I‚Äôm in the twilight zone. That‚Äôs the only explanation,6

"I think Marsh risking his career has something to do with making a statement in the IPL. He has been criticised year after year going into the auction and dropping out eventually because of injuries. I think, he just wanted to make a statement that he's as dedicated as the next guy for tournament. I respect that sentiment, but really shouldn't have done so. Should have said a firm No when asked to bat. The injury looked bad in the first place and looks even worse after he came to bat. May he recover real soon.",36

The taste of victory...why does it feel so empty? Is it because my tongue has dried up and is incapable of doing it anymore? Wait... why are my cheeks wet?,20
RCB got really lucky with Warner getting runout at nonstrikers by Bairstows drive and MMarsh getting injured. Sure SRH didn't have a middle order but it wouldn't have mattered with RCB's bowling and Fielding otherwise.,9
Rcb winning the 1st game of ipl while defending is a helluva meme per se,10

Justin Langer would be fuming right now. How can SRH risk the best no.6 test batsmen against RCB ??,24
Even after this win Umesh's bowling will give me nightmares.,25
"The elite three, RCB, KXIP and DC have all managed to play good opening games",30
"Rcb bowling out opposition with bowlers like dube n umesh up their ranks

That some impressive haul",17
"RCB were lucky today. SRH threw away a won game.

That bowling lineup is not gonna get RCB too far. 

Different season, same story seems like.",18
This just proves that SRH desperately needs a good middle order batsman. Williamson must play at least in some matches and Nabi in others according to the opponent team.,32
"SRH was not shitty. It was just the cruelness of sport.   


1. Warner dismissal
2. Marsh injury- eliminating a batsman entirely
3. Rashid injury at a crucial juncture totally disturbing the rhythm
4. Priyam Garg also somewhat unlucky dismissal.

In spite of all that they were close.",36
"RCB did won this easy at the end, but still don't give the confidence.
CSK won few days back with few tense moments, still one feels they would be in top 4.

Weaklinks for rcb , umesh, dubey and now past his prime Steyn.",2
Isuru should replace Steyn and we need to do something about Lord Umesh as well. Just can't control his economy.,8
Ab rates Philippe r/cricket experts in shambles,30
"In the 3 matches played, only CSK looked comfortable. Oh yea daddy's army tho",37
2020 is soo wild that RCB has started winning matches. This is the peak.,17
Maybe they'll bring in either Williamson or Nabi now,20
"**50+ scores for ABD vs SRH**

89 (2014) - Won 

82 (2016) - Won

69 (2018) - Won

**51 (Today) - Won**",52
AB take off your cap and.reveal how bald you are.,-16
Anyone got a clip of Warner's dismissal? Sky Sports on Twitter are location hogging cunts,14
"Loved that shot with Virat, AB and Steyn. Meant a lot to them clearly and for good reasons. Gl for rest of the season",19
Haha losing to RCB in the early stages of the tournament. What have we become? Shambolic middle order.,25
"In between, RCB never won an IPL whenever they have won their 1st game. But it's 2020 so they win this  time üòÇ",20
"**Pandey with his classic 100 strike rate**.

Some things just don't change.",30
ABD is a good orator.,22
Washington Sundar bowled only 1 over. Not sure what's the point of him in the team as he is primarily a bowler.,26
Maybe RCB's evil plan is to first give their fans hope that this year they are going to be different,38
What has sundar done to deserve this,14
"Vijay 3D Shankar -0  

Ambati 1D Rayudu - 1

Ambati rayudu wins the first round",50
Warner terming the game bizarre is bizarre,27
"That was an RCB-esque performance by SRH there at the end. Shouldn't have really lost it, but then again we've seen weirder things in 2020.",18
"How's Udana been lately?

RCB can drop Umesh & Philippe and get in Udana and Parthiv Patel",13
Why was marsh so late?,10
"It must be said, chahal bowled beautifully",36
Whose mistake was that crash Abhishek or Rashid ?,9
Dick trophy.,2
Imagine leaving Williamson out with a middle order like that. A casual Williamson innings at 130 strike would have won them the game.,40
Someone tweeted during the 2016 olympics that every game should have an average person competing as a benchmark. Maybe that is Vijay Shankar's purpose?,39
"Roses red
Violets blue
Mayanti loves Binny
Umesh almost missed a fifty",25
"Vijay Shankar is a deadly combination of Kohli and Burmah. He bowls like Kohli and bats like Burmah. This joke is old, but gold.",77
Kohli finally gets to use the winning captain speech,46
Yuzi was the player of the match for me,27
Guts from Marsh to come out and try.,18
Virat - we were not 10-20 runs short.,33
Does anyone have a stat of how many wides down the leg has umesh bowled?!,22
"If Marsh's injury is aggravated, I swear, I'll stop supporting this selfish club. I don't rate Marsh much and been supporting SRH for last 7 Years. But something about the way they sent him to bat risking his Career for a lost cause at the end doesn't sit well with me. I don't want the franchise I support to do that. Fuck it!",32
It's a freaky friday situation. RCB have defended like SRH in previous seasons and SRH have kohlapsed,24
"**Team to All Out Opponents most times in IPL**

MI - 27

CSK - 19

**RCB - 17**

RR - 15

KKR - 11",33
Kohli's like it could have gone way worser,11
S H O U L D E R S. D R O P P I N G,10
"Yuzi MoTM!
Turned the game for us.Well deserved.
Also , really really brave from Marsh. Respect from the other side!",22
"That's confusing, player of the match is different than man of the match.",18
Ok so RCB players apparently want to be in pressure situations. I fucking can't even...,27
"Rcb should always aim to score at least 15 more runs than the par score, cant trust their bowling lineup to defend such totals always",29
Chahal and Ashwin have both proved that the best way to utilize the lockdown period was YouTube streams rather than flexing in those gym sessions.,49
I feel Isuru and Morris/Ali should replace Steyn and Phillipe. Don't really see that happening for a couple of games though,8
"Seeing Kohli's grin at the post match presentation, seemed like he himself couldn't believe that how they managed to win.",59
"Warner, bairstow, Williamson, Rashid. Srh should Stick with these four imo",34
"Ppl talking abt pitches being for pacers early in the tournament but quality spinners have been the best bowlers in their respective matches

Chawla ashwin n chahal",21
"If Warner flops this IPL, god save SRH.",35
"Also, Massive Respect for **Devdutt Paddikal**. So much composure at such a young age, unbelievable! Such a good pick for RCB. Looking forward to more such innings from him. He has a bright future ahead.",45
"**Devdutt Padikkal**: 

**Fifty** on First-class debut

**Fifty** on List-A debut

**Fifty** on T20 debut

**Fifty** on IPL debut

Serious talent! And he is just 19 year old. Quality player. He is special.",68
"If cricketers were characters from the office, Vijay Shankar would be Toby",58
"Sept 24 - KIXP VS RCB 

Tune in for shit show",45
What's the deal with 2 MOM?,11
Philippe should atleast get two or three more chances.,28
knew something like this could happen they just missed their most reliable batsman.,9
Looking forward to see Jaiswal tomorrow.,18
"Rcb fans, join the Late Night Celebrations at r/RCB !",20
Ee sala namdeee,31
"I predicted a 23 run victory for RCB earlier. They won by 10 but they still won when everyone was saying they'd lose. When Mr.experimenter speaks, the world listens!",-59
"Today Srh was more Rcb than Rcb.

Would love to see Rcb out Rcb their opponent next time.",54
"Let me quickly debunk this notion that we need Nabi in our team to find perfect balance. Spoiler: We don't. Nabi could've been a good addition in Indian conditions, but as I've explained somewhere in the sub, Nabi likes the ball coming onto his bat and plays very early. Sadly the pitch is getting slower. A couple of matches down the line, it'll get as slow as BSNL 2G on a hot Sunday afternoon. Who we need is, as many have pointed out before, Kane. To hold this brittle and inconsistent middle order together. You can't win the tournament betting on people like Fraud Pandey and 3D Shankar. They are memes by themselves already. Getting in someone like Samad who's a genuine leggie can add more dimension to our bowling as the 5th bowing option. Abhishek is already a good enough 6th bowling option along side 3D Shankar and if needed Kane can roll up his sleeves for a couple of overs of off spin. We've been brainwashed to think that Nabi gives us Team balance(he's a bit of hit and miss. A great finisher, but can't hold off a collapse). When actually, he weakens the batting line up even further.",31
"It's about time when Manish needs to start winning matches. SRH management has shown so much trust on him and frankly he has not delivered except some decent performances last season. You just can't expect Warner and Bairstow to bail you out every time.

Mitchell Marsh has a unfortunate history of getting injured and not sure whether management really didn't consider that while picking him during auctions.

SRH should have tried searching for some other fast bowlers instead of continuing with same set of bowlers. Except Bhuvi to some extent everyone else has been ordinary to say the least. Better to pick Khaleel in place of 
Sandeep. He atleast has some pace.

Picking Williamson will be still very tough task as SRH really don't have a top class Indian all-rounder to replace any of the foreign all rounders. Based on the ground either Fabien or Nabi should be picked in next match.

Abhishek Sharma has been with this team for couple of seasons. Looks decent with bat. I believe he should be promoted at no 4 with other young players like Priyank, Samad, Virat Singh getting rotated.

Overall I believe they could have done a much better job in auctions by picking up some top scorers in domestic circuit rather than completely going for young talent.",29
"RCB was spectacular yesterday, but it was a disappointing score as they had a shining start. ABD's late fireworks got RCB to a respectable score. In the bowling however, things weren't looking good for them. The wicket of Bairstow made things collapse for SRH. After that they seemed to have lost their firepower and wickets fell easily. It was an overall respectable but disappointing match for SRH.",9
[deleted],-2
SRH batting looking wafferthin beyond the openers. They must play Kane along with Warner and Bairstow. And find a replacement to Vijay Shankar,7
Did srh fans forget that 3d got Padikkal out? Plus hes a one down/two down batsman and surely not a finisher.  No defence for 3d but blaming him so much just because he got out for duck isn't right.,13
Why is shankar called 3D,9
