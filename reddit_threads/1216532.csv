Lezz go boois,6
Looks like I am always 1st to comment on every match thread . Wtf,2
Cricket's El Clasico a day before Football's El Clasico,8
Imagine if csk loses this game. Trolling level will be sky high,3
"Reminder that **CSK is the only team to score more runs than MI against them in 20 overs**

MI have won 6 other games and tied 2",12
MI pls don't lose.,3
"Ah yes, MI twitter page is calling this as ""The El Classico"".",10
"Here for the shit ass buttkicking we're gonna get today. If we don't field our regular XI, time to go to bed early for me.",3
"Since 2018, excluding openers and playoffs, MI have always lost their game before facing CSK. But have always defeated CSK

(2018 Lost vs SRH, beat CSK. 2019 Lost vs KXIP, beat CSK, Lost vs RR, beat CSK. 2020 Lost vs KXIP) Happened twice in 2013 too",6
"Hopefully CSK make some changes today. Looking forward to see Tahir play. It's actually surprising that they haven't tried him till now considering how wank their spinners have been.

Jadeja-  4 wickets @ econ of 9.34 and avg of 61.5

Chawla - 6 wickets @ econ of 9.1 and avg of 31.83

Karn - 4 wickets @ econ of 8.67 and avg of 32.5


These are really bad numbers, especially for Jadeja.",7
Gosh I feel dirty rooting for CSK,64
Csk can win today,1
"Kris Srikanth: CSK will easily score 200

Sunny G: You'll have to reach 150 first to score 200",174

"This is what nightmares are made of.

Facing much stronger team in small ground",4
Kinda scared my pc will fail if I read this thread. All the static discharge from the Spark™ can't be too good for my components,9
End up with 5 wins in total and that's okay.. Just don't lose to MI and RCB please,1
Waiting for Jadhav to be in the XI,2
Im so early that I can't find any *spark*ing memes yet,4
"CSK bros, go stun MI. Don’t be knocked out",8
Sharjah again? Hope there isn't a ball stealer this time too haha,2
Rooting for Chennai to win today as I’m sure many of my RCB brethren are lol,4
[removed],9
"What is ""Rivalry Week"" that Star Sports is promoting? Were all the other weeks Friendship Weeks?",13
Come on csk. We rcbians are with u,8
"Every diehard CSK and Dhoni fan I know are pissed at him for his infamous *spark* comment. It took needless remarks on youngsters to bring the fans to their senses. Dhoni is not THAT immune from hatred, after all.

I really hope there's a decent amount of changes in the squad, and a place for the youngsters. This tournament is long gone, but it'll serve as a platform for the future of CSK to train. 

All I hope for is a good game, win or loss. Next year, CSK has to emerge stronger.",10
[removed],9
Have a genuine Q. Why did Bravo fly back? Why not just stick around and watch his team play their last few games and then fly back?,6
"Nehra claims he had advised Dhoni that don't bowl Negi vs Hardik in 2015 in the 19th over. The same Ashish Nehra advised Kohli to bowl Negi vs Hardik in 2019 in the 19th over. Irrespective, Hardik smacked Negi both the times and won the game",48
"I think this might be a close one but I think, ultimately, the team who scores the most runs will win the match.",12
guys guess the most memed player for tonight,7

Squad announced yet?,2

"Cmon guys, shit on scooty too much he should make a straight up century",3
"Considering the frequency of APOLOGY THREADS we are having later in the tournament.. 

Will we have one MEGA APOLOGY THREAD for either Kedar Jadhav or Piyush Chawla or even both ? 👉👈🥺",5
"I'm not sure if I've done this before, but let's go CSK",4
SPARKS NIGHT!,4
"Now instead of TVS and Ape sponsoring CSK, Suzuki and Honda to sponsor them now",2
I think the only way to help the players to perform better is cut down their salary if they perform badly and give them bonus if they perform good,-10
Chennai Spark Kings,4
Oooo Mi please be the one to give the finishing blow to csk.,2
Is that Hardik with Dhoni? Well let's see how Hardik uses Dhoni's tips.,4
my call for this match: this gonna be a doze fest after all that hype,5
"Guyssss, today guru randhawa will play for csk!!!",1
"I am scared that CSK is going to get such a thorough thrashing, it will resurrect some SL trauma.",90
Any comment against csk and thala will get reported and may lead to permanent account ban - Thala Stans,3
I just hope it won't be a snooze fest. At least look like you're trying to win CSK. There's no INTENT.,3
Dhoni will have to take the matchsticks out of the matchbox to see the spark.,1
"spark™, nrr™,experience™,quantumloss™ some of the csk trademarks this season

edit :- tuktuk™,intent™",10
[removed],5
"Power of IPL is when Legends like Lara and Sangakkara do 90 min pre show on how Thala Dhoni and CSK can still qualify for Knock-outs. BBL, T20 Blast need to work on it and get this done, imagine Lara saying "" Clive Rose is one cheeky bowler""  or Sanga saying "" There's still cricket and fire left in Ravi Bopara"" 😭😂😭😂😭😂😂",10
"CSK pls win.

- sincerely an RCB fan.",43
"Dont mind me, I'm just here to see Kedar Jadhav's redemption arc",122
Just be aware of the downvoters. They might raid again.,1
If CSK wins I'll send nudes to my boss,5
I am ready to get hurt again,7
"There should be a bot that keeps counting the number of times “Spark” will be used in this thread, most probably will cross “intent”",5
Mark my words - thala will score 27 (20),3
tahir is going to play today according to cricinfo,1
Remind me again Which teams want CSK to win today and those benifitted from MI win?,2
this sub is going to tear into that spark™ and process™ speech arent they?,9
"While everyone is finding new ways to put cheeky one-liners on SPARK, Mr. u/Iamyoursoul123 is hosting an educational Q&A session on cosmetics in this thread. Keep it up. 😂",6
Mumbai should first win one more game before giving rest to some players,-1
MI vs CSK matches are boring.,2
"I don't know who this man is, but I hope Prince Balwant Rai plays just for his name.",2
"Dhoni 121^* off 57 balls
Jadhav 63 off 40 balls
Sam Curran 52^* off 23 balls  
CSK 252/1 at the end of 20 overs
Bumrah 4-0-0-73",23
Do you support blm in ipl?,4
I'm ready for disappointment again.,1
That new Cred ad is really bad.,2
Spark time,0
Lol pollard captain today....,0
"No Rohit yesssss

Go CSK",2
"I'm sick and tired of all the reverse jinxes, so I'll just come out and say it. Rohit to hit 200, MI 350. Bumrah to take 10 wickets in 2 overs(with Boulto bowling a maiden in between)

Edit- God dammit Rohit is sick and isn't even playing. Nice. Yay optimism",4
"Rohit not playing today, Pollard at toss, maybe we will see Lynn in for NCN and Kulkarni in for Rohit?",5
Let's go CSK. Show us some spark,3
Rohit not playing today. Not a big loss from the batting side honestly.,2
Looking forward to the friendly banter and anodyne opinions in today's match thread!,3
What happened to Rohit?!,2
Just want MI to bat first....,2
"Kieron ""100% captaincy record"" Pollard",6
"Even Cricinfo wants to make sure they are on the spark train.

>**Spark enthusiasts unite.** I've spotted Stephen Fleming pointing in Imran Tahir's direction, and then applause as the CSK huddle disperses. Make of that what you will.",4
[deleted],3
Even last year hitman was out against csk and pollard was captain and he went bonkers and won the match,3
"Ffs Murli Kartik just said ""Dream 11 IPL 2002""

You have one job baldy",5
Imma be honest. Does the average Indian viewer understand these Aussie commentators especially the girls lol,1
Resting Rohit like we rest our best players against teams like Bangladesh or Zimbabwe amirite?,10
Why is Rohit Sharma not there today?,3
MI fielding. Not surprised.,2
Csk needs some sparks tonight,1
Pollard captain = pollard dream 11 captain,3
Okay guys. I am about to be banned.  It was nice meeting you all,4
Ah shit! Wanted MI to bat first to see some firepower in this small ground...,6
"Hoping for csk to bring in the young guns and win the match. Just to prove ""Intent Spark"" wrong",5
Pollard is a pain in ass for Chennai he was responsible for 2 final defeats,5
What changes for MI Pollard fucked up,2
Fuck csk batting.. will be scoring 75 and then MI finish in 9 overs,3
Saurabh “the fridge” Tiwary,5
Vada pav replaced by another Vada pav,7
Dhoni has good hairline for 40 yr old,9
"I don't even want a win, hoping for a performance from the 'youngsters' for some quality shitpostage.",18
"Thought the least we could do was win a toss, couldn't even do that with consistency",6
"A gentle reminder. 

Kedar Jadhav: 62 Runs in 8 Games (SR 94)

Jagadeesan: 33 Runs in 1 Game (SR 118)",47
"If rr was playing in India,do you think they would win?",1
Imran Tahir finally!!!,3
Jaggi 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,1
"MI bowling first.

Saurabh Tiwary in for Rohit (Rohit is injured)

Kedar, Watson, Chawla out - Tahir, Jaggi, Ruturaj in for CSK",6
3 Spark Holders- Out                                                                             3 Sparkless Guys- In,4
So MS thinks CSK didn’t perform due to the additional 14 day quarantine. Lmao,4
Imran Tahir finally gets a chance,3
There are 4 lefties in the batting order. Chennai's spinners (except Tahir) might be taken out of picture.,1
Sparking match,1
Mi win against strong teams and lose against weak teams. 4d chess by CSK to be shit this year so they can  improve their h2h,5
Who will open with quinny? Surya or tiwary?,1
Watto got the booto,2
Scooter goes brrrr,2
Saurabh tiwary replacing rohit sharma what is This 2007?,6
"In the second leg of MI CSK last year, Dhoni didn't play. Today Rohit",3
It took them 10 games to bring in Tahir!,6
Dhoni checked out the profiles of the young guns on tinder and finally saw a spark.,3
I hope Ro doesn't miss the Australian tour.,3
That is a weak ass batting lineup for MI. Thank God I'm going to be stuck at work until late and won't catch most of the game.,5
I can't imagine the pressure on the CSK youngsters rn,52
Squad annoucned yet? Toss over right?,7
"Please CSK ""sparkless"" youngsters perform well 🙏🙏",9
Rohit at 197 IPL games. Hopefully he gets to complete 200 this season,15
I SEE TAHIR!,7
Finally some good fucking food,6
I hope Jagadeesan and Ruturaj perform excellently today just to rub it in Dhoni and CSK management's face.,7
"CSK pls just let Ruturaj open ffs

He's an opener, use him as an opener",10
Time for Gaikwad to show some S P A R K ™,1
What is this dumb ass questions,3
Is rohit injured or unwell?,1
"The memes aside, Pollard said Rohit had an issue with his hamstring. I hope he will be okay and come back later in the tourney!",7
Disappointed.was hoping to see Lynn in this small stadium.,2
Finally Tahir!!!!!!,3
"Chris lynn is nonexistent.

Tho his warming the benches thing might be a sign of luck for MI I guess...",5
"Scenes if the Sparkless, Spark today.",5
CSK is such a weak team that Rohit Sharma has ruled himself out of the match to maintain balance.,8
Surya opening sounds a good idea when Rohit is there in the middle order. So I would prefer Tiwary opening instead,3
Gaikwad used Tide detergent for the sparkle,2
Kedar Jadhav robbed of a chance to score 100* (30) by being dropped from the team #JusticeForKedar,18
Hope Gaikwad opens the batting and Faf comes in at no.3,2
IMO Chawla was the worst pick in the auction. Not only did he underperform but also took Tahir out of the 11.,5
"Match hasn't even started yet and the same jokes and memes have been beaten to death. Oh well, here's hoping for some good cricket and for CSK to show some fight.",4
This chick kinda hot tho,4
"These changes are about 4-5 matches too late. Especially, Tahir. Benching last season's purple cap winner for more than half the season is truly a big brain move.",52
I hope gaikwad and Jagadeesan  wear some Archer level jewelry for some added spark.,6
When was the last time CSK made 3 changes?,5
Do we know what happens if the CSK youngsters spark? Does MSD get shocked?,4
I really hope thair doesn't get injured running after taking a wicket.,3
All indian 'trying to be US' chicks look the fucking same.,11
"Jokes apart, so guys who’s gonna open with Qdk since Rohit is injured?",3
Looking at history of Hamstring Injury of Rohit  could he miss the tournament?,4
I hope Jadeja bats higher. He's been their best batsman.,3
Vada pav Rohit Sharma replaced by bigger vada pav Saurabh Tiwary.,14
"It must be heartbreaking for  youngsters in the CSK to hear from one of the most influential voices in Indian cricket and their own captain say that they have no ""spark.""",7
Jadeja should bat a bit up the order otherwise CSK have no chance,5
No vadapav jokes today :(,4
Finally a sensible XI!,3
"This is the probably the best possible team for CSK. If they dont win this, they never had any chance",19
Damn...No Kedhar Jadhav in playing eleven...No chance for Kedhar Jadhav apology thread.,8
I just hope the younglings do well just to rub it in their face.,5
"Watson is out, Chawla is out, Kedar is out. Ruturaj, Jagadeesan and Tahir are in.

*Happy Tears*

Finally some sense",90
Why does Rayudu always look like he simultaneously just ate a big plate of vada pavs and witnessed Vietnam  in his picture?,4
"It's good that Rohit is resting considering the gruelling Australia series coming up.

MI has practically qualified and it won't hurt if he takes time off before the play-offs.",0
✨ Spark© ✨ Tips™ ✨,2
"Wow! 3 changes! Hopefully, the sparks are turn into a forest fire today!",2
"Has any one of you had chance of meeting MSD, vk or Rohit?",2
[deleted],3
Does anyone know the female presenter's name who hosts Cricket Live?,2
"All the old guys been removed.

But 1 still remains. We love you but it's about time.",3
Jagadeesan and Ruturaj explode like fireworks today and blind Dhoni with your sparks.,35
Would be the height of irony if CSK win both their matches against MI in their worst season,28
I want the youngsters to do well but CSK to lose :'(,12
"CSK batting looks weak, we should bundle them for 155 odd ideally but we have a history of not doing well against meme teams so we will see.",0
"Scenes if CSK win tonight!! I'll burn down /r/Cricket  single-handedly.

God make this happen😂..",12
"The ground is so small, that Tahir’s celebration run might take him out of the stadium",10
"Great to see the great man stick by his words, but still would love to see Sai Kishore get a look in somewhere",3
Kishan 60 off 20 loading,5
"If the sparkless end up sparkless, the Dhoni apology thread will be 6500 comments long today.",11
Who can Chennai target next few years?,4
Watto is a good guy,4
"Atleast, the match won’t go till the last over!",1
I think this finally is the end of Watson's career. Respect to THE BEST allrounder in IPL history. No player till now has come close to what Watson was for Rajasthan.,98
But I hope Sai Kishor also gets a chance to play.,1
[deleted],-2
Would be insane if tahir wins this for them or even if the youngsters do well. I am predicting a twitter breakdown.,5
Finally Chennai play Tahir. They might actually win today.,5
Damn already around 360 comments 15 minutes before the game.,2
That dood with the dhoni house in the tamil comms is delusional.,5
"I'm Afraid of just Rayudu this match, everyone else can be handled",-4
"Kanal oru thari mathi

T: All it takes is a spark",4
[deleted],1
Nothing to lose.. Let's go all guns blazing bois!,6
"I really hope CSK shows a bit more patience with these two youngsters at least for these 4 games. Not every team is like MI to have youngsters perform in their first few games. Sometimes things click, sometimes they don’t.",7
"Dhoni’s post match response in previous games: well the pitch really slowed down in the second innings.

Dhoni’s expected response at EOD today: the pitch really eased up for them and the ball was coming nicely onto the bat.",-1
Why haven’t CSk played Tahir until now?,2
"Will we ever get to see any franchise have a CSK like long run of never missing the playoffs. It'll be tough. The IPL is weird that way with constant auctions and team changes that there's no clear imbalance between top and bottom teams season after season. 

We've seen worst to first and the other way round. I remember when we had the Lions and RPSG franchises even for 2 season. It was wild. They finished right on top and bottom in their 2 seasons.",7
Match threads are more active on the days CSK is playing,5
How many players can a franchise retain before a mega auction?,2
It'll be most peculiar season if CSK wins today,4
You think Raina is watching?,3
Kieron Pollard is shit he'll get exposed by Thala today,-6
Ruthuraj could have been what Devdutt was for RCB but alas.,6
I'm a mi fan but want csk youngsters to do well,6
Rayudu's IPL Picture be like : 👁️👄👁️,5
who do you guys rate more Thakur or Deepak Chahar,2
Why isn't Rohit playing btw,3
I want MI to win the tourney obviously but Rohit's fitness for Aus Tests > MI. Hope they don't rush him.,8
Who's gonna open for csk? Gaikwad or Curran?,4
wow csk actually did all the changes people were asking for,2
[deleted],7
Meanwhile in Star Sports Tamil: Hype music with CSK vs MI visuals,7
Feels like csk going to win this.,2
"Last time polly was captain, he promoted himself....and then all of us know how he scored",5
"Lynn could have been a perfect choice for CSK, even if not initially but I mean it could have been great. An explosive overseas opener would have done them a world of good.",3
[deleted],4
I am watching with yellow lights in my room so that the spark within csk doesn't blind me,6
"CSK with my dream selection, finally! Should have done 4 matches earlier. Anyway, there is good hope for CSK to win today's match.",5
The IPL opening sequence with all the captains in the dark is fucking sick. Feels like a marvel movie,6
how good would it be if tahir gets a 5fer,7
"Why is it that when optimus looks for the allspark its all fine and dandy, but when MSD tries to find it he's ostracised?",5
Omg guys last night I had a dream that David Warner looked like a toddler. Fucking strange,11
On an unrelated note. Has anyone heard of the early 70's rock band The Sparks? [Some awesome music right here.](https://youtu.be/08DFrY4ig_c),4
"Imagine a CSK fan

If Tahir does well and wins them the game, (s)he'll be angry as the team didn't play him before

If Tahir does bad and CSK loses, (s)he'll be sad coz well, the team is knocked out",9
"On one hand, I'm sad I can't see  the eccentric nature of Indian ads anymore and the other cool af ads that kept me entertained between overs , and on the other hand, I'm happy I can't see the shitty ads too. Looking at you, weird frog paint ad",2
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",3
Finally Tahir is playing. I don't get why CSK held him for so long when he was literally their best bowler last season.,6
"If MI wins, they go to the top.

If CSK wins, RR goes to the bottom.",4
I'm too bored today.. hoping for a spicy match,4
"Hope RCB retains Devdutt, that'd be great.",5
"Imagine if jadhav comes in for an injured player and does 50(12) cameo.

Lord Jadhav apology thread coming after the match",2

KKR luckiest team this season.,3
"Switched to tamil commentary. Let’s get it for real fandom, where they aren’t afraid to criticize the team they love",2
Is it just me or has Rohit looked out of form this tournament anyway?,2
"Speaking of dreams,  a week ago, I had dream where I was having tequila shots with jofra,Jos and smith. They were wearing rr's Jersey and were depressed about their form. Is it a sign?",5
"People asking for MI to finishing off CSK haven't been watching CSK finish off CSK all season.

Jaggi, Faf, Ambati, Ruttu, MS, Jadeja, Scurran?

Or: Jaggi, Ruttu, Faf, Ambati, MS, Jadeja, Scurran?",0
Why is Rohit not playing?,2
Csk should open with jagadesan and gaikwad. Give the young guns a free chance. See what they can do.,8
"kay bois, less goo embarrass ourselves",4
"Chennai supporter here. Genuine question. 

I’m supposed to go and meet a friend in a little while, but I’m conflicted: should I watch this match or go out? Do CSK have a hope in hell?",9
"Screw the match, I just want Tahir to take a 4 for and piss on the faces of Dhoni-Fleming.",43
"MI really shouldn't be worrying about the marginal benefit of the NCN batting edge over Pattinson

Pattinson was really good for them in the first half. Just jad one poor game. They should just play the better bowler. They have more than enough batting. 

Guys like Krunal Pandya have faced a handful of balls all season.",8
Vada pav to replace another vada pav,8
"CSK 66/0 after PP with Gaikwad and Jagadeesan opening

Then they get out, Dhoni comes in and scores a solid 36 (40) and CSK will get a below par score of 164.",9

Welp thats anti-climactic, hamstring is a real pain in the ass",9
"With 4 Lefties in the MI's Top 7, Jaddu is basically playing as a Specialist Batsman today(like most matches this season.)",4
Why can't we have Jadhav open with Mayank in the upcoming test series?,2
Still csk has Mitch Santner who is a decent all rounder and a good FIELDER. lot of missed opportunities this season.,3
Aight Gaikwad is opening. Lets see what happens,3
Tahir looks like an actual lion with his weirdly gold mane of hair lol,7
Where's the long hair umpire?,2
Imagine me (a Pom) wanting Chennai (a team with an Aussie) to beat Mumbai (a team without an Aussie). 2020 really is a strange year,6

"Had one of those cognitive evaluation tests today - basically to test if you're gifted or retarded when it comes to all sort of weird puzzles - and it was 8 minutes per section. Didn't read the instructions, went straight for it. Did the 10 questions in a few minutes, then sat there like *huh, sometimes my genius is... it's frightening.* 

Then... the arrow button caught my eye at the last 10 seconds as I checked my answers and realized there were 14 other fucking questions. Timer ran out and moved on.  

Now when I get the results they're gonna think I have the cognitive processing of Thala-Jadhav and I honestly can't refute that. So CSK pls do me proud today and fuck up greater than I did :)",2
"and suddenly everything seems normal, wow",5
I want Mumbai to go on top but also CSK to climb out of the bottom place. What a weird situation to be in.,0

Boulto is back with a bang after a poor performance.",7
There goes the spark!,2
Maybe thats why youngsters were not playing,4
Dhoni probably got his first excuse for the post match presentation!,6
"There was an edge, was there not? I didn't see any daylight",6
Gaikwad and Jagdeeshan probably wouldn't have got this or any opportunity if CSK was in the Top 4 comfortably.,6
Wasn't that bat pad? I thought there was the slightest of edges,2
Dhoni always vindicates himself doesn't he...,6
CSK youngsters are made of Polycab wires. Spark hi nahi hota.,7
No spark,2
F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F,4
Why drop Watson thooooo,0
"Really wish we could've seen more of him, but we're stuck with csk vadapav now along with faf",9
Never thought i would feel bad after csk loses a wicket,6
A mini-watto dismissal,2
"Indian Umpires showing their ""CLASS"" again   
The fact that these dudes can make or break careers of domestic prospects through such erratic umpiring is scary",2
F spark :(,7
Inb4 Dhoni Apology thread.,11
No Spark found,6
Sparkling innings from Gaikwad,4
Open your eyes umpire,2
Logically who should srh fans be supporting today,3
Sparkling youngster. Dhoni saw these guys in nets and knew and  now for the whole world to see it .,11
It looked like he edged it,7
Spark was missing indeed,2
"Now I understand why Fleming said ""Youngsters. In our squad?""",6
"fuck, and we are back",3
Dhoni happy so that he might get enough balls to score 100.,3
"Poor Ruturaj

Can't blame him too much though, clearly doesn't have the backing of his captain",5
"Once again, Faf should have taken strike",4
Boult looks weird as fuck with that goatee.,4
Spark in csk and love in my life is missing,6
So dhoni was right about the spark lol,2
"In 10 matches Boult has given 4 first over wickets. 

Who wouldn't love that! They didn't even need to spend 15 Cr either!",15
Faulty spark plug...,3
Is there no live option in reddit now?,3
"Dhoni humming ""He didn't start the fire ...""",1
Who would you send in now?,2
Oh god unmukt chand flash backs!!!!!,7
Pollard taking the review just not to tilt Boult,6
I assure you Gayakwad is far better than this. Following for 2 years now. Can't blame him when Boult is spitting fire,5
Well looks like it's over for CSK. One less team to worry about for SRH,4
I still hope CSK persists with the youngsters in their remaining matches.,6
[deleted],2
Feel bad for Gaikwad.. he got thrown in the deep end of the pool,2
"Bad news for CSK fans, Jagadeesan also plays in the same mode as CSK, always goes around 100 SR even in SMA and State T20 League(TNPL). 

But he scores a lot of runs tho, that is why he's here.",4
I hope people (and management) don’t start shitting on the younger players like Ruturaj because they fail in the one match they have been allowed to play.,3
404 spark not found,7
Chennai RR watch: 0.00,1
So if he thought there was daylight between bat and ball why ultraedge? That looked like a slight edge.,3
"Good bowling by Boult, if he keeps going like this he might be as good as Siraj one day",10
What a fucking over from lord Boult,5
Maiden in sharjah is a crime.,12
I hope Gaikwad plays all the remaining matches.,4
Welp. looks like Dhoni got it right,9
Well boys. Dhoni is right about that statement about youngsters so far.,10
Hope Gaikwad gets more chances to prove himself,3
Boult has the best reactions when he's Bowling well,6
Hahahhahah,-1
Sparkles youngster is out,7
Yeah Gaikwad is out for a duck but feel really bad for him. He's been in and out of the side so much,10
Was there day light? Looked touch and go to me?,5
Ruturaj does not spark,3
Boult is on fire this year.,3
Plot twist : Alia Bhatt was Shalu all along,9
"To think “Great Learning” paid so much to Virat to be in their ad, and then came up with that boring BS ad. Shame.",9
Well well welllll...Yall question dhoni like this is his first month in field and cant see if someone has ittt or not...Nets exist right..,12
"Last game Rohit didn’t review Boult’s appeal and it ended up costing MI as Boult lost his rhythm. Now Pollard has reviewed for his paceman and it’s out, so expect Boult to become unplayable for the next while.",12
Way to make the young guys the scapegoat.,11
Boult reminding me of Kohli's wicket in WC semi final,4
"Ya don't expect youngster to click immediately against an international bowler when bowl is swinging. Appreciate CSK giving them opportunity, should do it often!",19
Can totally imagine CSK management (read Dhoni) shitting on Ruturaj and offloading him next season,2
Saw more maidens in last 5 days than the rest of the tournament.,7
Now Thala stans will scream everywhere how he was right about youngsters having no spark and they shouldn't be in the playing 11 and a bunch of 37 year olds are the right fit.,6
Now Gaikwad won't get a game for CSK until he's 60.,6
I mean why didnt faf take the strike. Gaikwad is still young why would you feed him to the dogs straight away,21
"See, Thala is right!",-3
"After the previous match, Boult would have killed Polly had he not gone for the review",7
An on-Fire Punjab needed 2 super overs to win against this team! Unless Sir or Thala does miracles I'm not really sure!,9
Watch Dhoni stans defend his spark comments now.,7
"I had an ice cream bet with my brother that every second comment on reddit thread will be something spark.

Thank you all for the win",9
"in before CSK young players perform poorly, fanbois going ~~crazy~~  tHaLaLaLa and concluding how he was right about ""no spark""",6
[deleted],3
"Seriously, do you guys think downvoting comments will make csk qualify ?",34
Far should’ve taken the strike. Putting an inexperienced batsman in front of an experienced quality bowler just breeds disaster. Smh,15
Ah fuck you Styris. I thought for a second that Kapil Dev was gone.,9
Classic wicket. 3 outswingers and a big in dipper,3
"So Rohit is out due to hamstring injury. Well, that's the reason we always said fitness is important and a professional like him should take it seriously. See the consequences of eating Vada Pao all too often and not taking his fitness seriously. He'll not be able to play consistently as he ages if he doesn't take his fitness seriously like Kohli.",3
"Gaikwad looked completely out of sorts playing in the middle order in previous two matches. Was hoping coming in to open would put him in good mindset but he looked nowhere near ready for this. Boult being great or not.

That frantic dab to run and try and get off strike showed itm",5
An in-form MI is one of the hardest teams to debut against. Hope they don't drop him before the next game just for this.,4
Genuine Q. How do bowlers and batsmen deal with piss breaks midmatch?,7
"I wanna support youngsters, but Dhenier is right, none of the CSK batting  youngsters have been good over the past 3 years. 

Jagadeesan had a decent innings earlier in the tournament (and shouldn't have been dropped for Jadhav imo) and Billings played a great innings against KKR a couple of years but the rest of the youngsters have just been mediocre (apart from the bowlers).

Still, CSK have nothing to lose and they SHOULD stick with Gaikwad for the remaining matches.",2
I hope he get another chance in next game,8
"I am so sick of these spark comments, they're not even close to funny.",2
"1 bad innings for Ruturaj: Thala was right

Bad tournament for Watson: I sleep",81
Gaikwad was nervy in the middle order too! His running seemed like GG!,2
Guys isn't that exactly how he got Kohli out?,2
"Some insight there.  
Styris said ""Hadlee was looking forward to being the record holder for a longer time before Kapil came along.""  
Maybe all the spiel about Records not mattering is just tosh and players are as petty as the rest of us",3
"Saurabh Tiwary is a like for like replacement for Sharma, thicness wise",3
Dhoni apology thread incoming?😂,4
Feel bad for Gaikwad.,5
I know Gaikwad didn't get much opportunities but if you're going out for a duck twice and striking below 100 there's not much of a chance.,5
Can't wait CSK to break our 263 record today,5
Oh no. Now Dhoni's Spark comment will be justified.,5
"Rayudu has always looked comfortable against Bumrah tbh

Edit: Should have waited 10 secs",8
If Tiwary replaces Rohit shouldn't he be the captain...? Brainless management from MI   /s,10
 boult 1st over. WC Flashback. Kohli.,4
"Good fucking Lord, I was not hoping for yet another anti-climatic match",3
Lmao,4
Ohno,2
WOW AGAIN?,1
BOOM,1
"Let's not shit on the youngster Gaikwad. 

Even the mightiest of openers have struggled against Boult.",9
"Pollard : Idk man , seems like an edge

Boult : Rohit would have taken it!",9
Gonzo. YESSSS.,1
Our last match tormenter is gone.,3
Shows over. Thanks for coming guys.,3
Just csk things.,4
Aight so we will be demolished,3
Fucking gaekwad got 3 chances and didn’t even cross 5 runs once.. and the fucker needs more chances.. dhoni was right..,1
Boom boom,3
C O L L A P S E,3
Boom took revenge for that front foot six Rayudu hit against him,5
0 of 5 balls. Youngsters following the footsteps of seniors.,7
Hopefully we dont get all out for 49,4
Is <49 coming?,2
"Young, old... 

Nobody has the spark",4
Will they cross 49?,6
Does this make Rayudu shit too then?,2
"Ffs here I go again

48 PLEASE",8
"CSK dads are similar to many Indian dads. Don't give your kids any chances to be independent and responsible, don't nurture them when they need it, and when you can't do it all, throw all the responsibility on them.",67
LMFAOOOOO FUCK CSK,3
CSK are getting worse each match,5
Tbh CSK does seem to have its best bowling attack today compared to all season.,4
Will it be like RCB vs KKR couple of nights back?,8
Feel soooo sad for Gaikwad. Dude already looked a nervous wreck void of confidence in his previous few innings. Now he's been fed to a gun international bowler immediately with a confuzzled mind and struggled.,37
"lol, Rayudu's spark is missing too.",14
"Another humiliation on the cards, I feel.",8
No. Oh no. Oh no No nO NO,6
"MI's bowling will make me cry, so accurate ;_;",4
Dhoni = noni,2
"CSK, please win this for KKR",2
This is so hard to watch,3
"Oh please, i wanted to see Pollard Blaze out. Now it looks like he won't even get to bat",4
CSK going the KKR way.,3
Let’s write straight up stories for csk fans to digest and not downvote - dw guys Thala gonna score 250 today!!!!!!!!,6
Oh no..... Anyways!!!!,3
Oh ok so that's what lack of spark AND intent looks like,2
"Yes! Barcelona is leading Real Madrid by 3 goals to 2! 

Oh wait...",6
C'mon CSK make us proud,3
"**1.4** Bumrah to Rayudu, OUT, **caught down leg side.** **3-2**

Bumrah and Boult gonna eat these youngsters™ alive,3
"49 is a good record to break, by MI",3
Brace yourselves for 49 memes bois,2
"And just like that, another spark bites the dust",2
Scoreboard is looking like a soccer scoreboard now smh,2
I work on covid floors in the hospital. I work night shift tonight. Watching this csk match is about to be the most depressing part of my day,1

"Dhoni is right! Junior made 0, senior made 2. 

Senior >> Junior.",6
The spark from CSK team is blinding my eyes,2
"This is just embarrassing. CSK has been terrible this whole tournament but this match and the RR one they just seem to have given up, no hope at all.",3
Not 3D can't play pace bowlers. This is why he wasn't selected and he had the ego to question selectors. Lol,5
Are khud to chud gaye ho at least jate jate baki teams ki maar ke jao,2
49 incoming ?,3
"I don't in any way expect Chennai to win, but come on at least score 160 at Sharjaj so we can have some fun in the chase",5
Bruh it’s your 11th match this IPL and countless experience in your life before. How can you not get decide what shot NOT to play???,1

 And now is 3-3. Great comeback.,8
CSK want the lowest score batting first record back from KKR.,8
Dhoni should walk in next and teach everyone what spark is,6
Yassss let go boiss,2

Is this just a repeat of KKR vs RCB from the other night?,5
Turning it off boys.,2
Ah so we are not the worst team in the league after all,6
Putting pressure on youngsters make them perform worse. Who would have thought?,9

Mi gonna top the table again,1
Fuck. Now all these MSD fanatics are going to harass these two youngsters saying they don’t have spark. Will be very demoralizing.,6
"In all seriousness, I really feel for Ruturaj and Jagadeesan. Thrown under the bus by their captain, come in against one of the best attacks in the IPL and struggle. They'll get shit for it even though the seniors have been awful all season",3

Post match interview will be amazing,6
Just for the record I called them Chennai Boring Kings and that comment is at -6 lol,5

Please guys. Save us some pain by deleting this thread.,7
Welp test match started,2
Time to make a Dhoni apology thread. It seems that the youngsters definitely don't have the spark.,5
This is just funny.,3
Spark status: Fused.,6

This year it’s just not it for csk. No SPARK whatsoever and I’ve tried my best to convince myself that something positive will be there but I guess that was only Gaikwad’s COVID test. Smh,2
Chelshit 🤝 Chenshit 3-3,3
Another sparkie comes to the crease.,2
"Dhoni's going to do a ""I told you so"" now, despite the fact that the players have crazy pressure because they've never got games",1
"Feel for these youngsters. 1 match here and there and then when things are irrecoverable, being thrown to the sharks.",3
It honestly is heartbreaking to see CSK like this. Really hope they make some good picks next year,1
Fuck my dream 11 points. Go jassi get that hattrick,4
Boom boom hatrick please,1
"Dhoni be like: ""I'll do it myself!""",4

"The atmosphere in the CSK dressing room can’t be great at the moment, and I wonder how much that has to do with what’s happening with these guys today.",12

Old man Sparky has walked out to bat,7

Are we gonna accept faf Curran Watson rayudu was better than this or not?,4

Look what 2020 has done. I’m actually now rooting for a Dhoni 30 (30).,4
Sparks,1
El-clasico. scoreboard approves.,7
Fade the Flair boys!! Or who am I talking none of the CSK flairs here right now.,2
"Unironically speaking, they should have played Kedar Jadhav today",2

Only Dhoni fans will be over the moon by this performance. Lmao,6
Dhoni comes in 3rd over WHAT?!,2
This might be the perfect chance to send our Lord and Savior Shardul Thakur into bat.,3

Maybe this was the reason Dhoni was sticking with Jadhav,6
"Jesus.. What a horror show for Gaikwad! 


3 innings - 2 ducks - 16 balls - 5 runs. 

I still hope they persist with him for few more matches.",4
Lord Jadhav would've at least hit 12(24),3
Lmao Dhoni in at 1.5 overs. He should score a century for old times sake and then retire immediately after. Probably will calm all the toxic fans and also stop the suffering. I should stop dreaming lol,9
"Dhoni WTF bro, say something like this when India are in an ICC knockout again",2
CSK retains all old players next season.,3
Dhoni ah. So we are finishing at 80-6 in 20 overs.,6

Dhoni shouldn't have made the spark comment. He put unnecessary pressure on the youngsters.,5
Apparently CSK were 3/3 in the 2013 final as well.,5
Bumrah should have bowled fuller on the hatrick ball,3
"Motabhabhi when washing motabhai's trousers:

"Haha dhoni be batting slow when there is 5 overs left with NRR left.

"Hahaha .. watching KKR and CSK is peak schadenfreude for RCB fans.

2020 continues to confound.",7
Call off tournament,4
Test cricket is real cricket anyway!,7

Delete this team,5
Tbf MS might have seen these guys bat in the nets and I think he is good enough to judge whether players are ready or not. Look at deepak Chahar for example I was certainly not expecting his debut in first match in 2018. The Spark comment is still not justified though,3
"3-4 !!!!!
State of CSK team...",3
Is this the highlights package?,2
You know you're fucked when you can't make out if it is 3 runs and 4 wickets or 4 wickets and 3 runs,8
This is somehow even worse than the kkr match,5

Punjab really pissed Mumbai off didn't they,74
Enjoy the wooden spoon CSK,6

How the fuck did this team beat us by 10 wickets,9
CSK taking the lead with a brilliant brace there. 5-4 now.,5
Makes sense why csk doesn't have spark. Bolt stole all the spark for itself,5
More runs than wickets. Moral Victory,6
there goes our 1% chance of qualifying,8
Chennai Sappura Kings.,6
"They don't care, do they? They just want this tourney to end so they can do something about the team makeup.",3
At this rate... should have just sent Curran to open.,6
"Dhoni and jaddu batting is not something I thought I would see in 3rd over

Just 2020 things",4
"Only just started watching due to work, what the hell have I missed?!",2
How do you expect Dhoni to win with these gully cricketers? Disgraceful effort,4
Life is overrated anyway.,5
Took the term El clasico to the next level.. Classic football scoring 3-4 !!,7
Mumbai should just bowl all 8 overs of Bumrah and Boult rn tbh,11
Sam opening....again,9
Never thought I'd see Jaddu and Dehnier bat in the 3rd over ever,9
feeling terrible for sam curran atm,7
The best batsman for CSK is out right now and he ain't wearing No. 7 jersey,5
Well this is test run for Jaddu as Opener literally.,3
Can we reach 10? Pls,4
Jaddu denied Boult from breaking Lord Siraj record,3
Seems like the 'spark' has turned into a dumpster fire,4
Cmon Pollard bowl Bumrah again you madlad,5
Nooo Mumbai is down 5-4. Who do you reckon will reach 10 first,11
Where all the csk fans at?,7
I don't want to see Dhoni get out today. Either he will be completely exposed or we will be in for a treat after so long.,2
These have been some good couple of matches where I’m able to sleep early quite unlike the last weekend madness,5
[Watson right now](https://www.indiaaheadnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sonu.jpg),3
Holy shit what happened,2
So many sparks I'm blinded,7
Glad to see Jadeja opening with Dhoni. Senior player and Captain leading from the front.,8
10-10 incoming,3
Classic Collapse Repair Crew is here.,3
Is this the same team that just a few days ago chased down 180 odd for no loss?,5
Can they win the first set 6-4?,31
Gave 2 runs in 1 ball. Poor from Boult. Drop this guy.,27
So called sparkling experienced guys like FafDu and Rayudu are back in the pavilion as well so don't blame only the youngsters for this collapse.,24
They’re batting like the way I used to while playing Don Bradman Cricket and not knowing which button does what,78
CSK increased their total by 66% in just one ball using this one simple trick!,29
Why the fuck is football score showing when I am watching cricket,4
Just tuned in to Star Sports and for a moment thought a football match was on. 4-4.,4
Very nice. I like,5
"Wtf is this a football match

I'm confused by the score

(shamelessly stolen from cricbuzz from the kkr match lol)",9
Holy shit what is this score. Looks like all the spark fizzled out lol,5
Punjab really really pissed off MI,10
"Dei, will you guys atleast score 10 runs today ?",1
Can CsK still qualify guys?,1
Almost a fifth wicket,3
CSK imploding like global economy in 2020,4
Proper spanking,2
Jadeja already top scorer and best strike rate after facing just 1 ball.,6
"**Losing first four wickets for fewest runs in IPL**:

"At this point csk shouldn’t be worried so much about 49 all out as they should about, say, 30 all out",5
"I'm not saying this is CSK's fault for not opening with Sam Curran... no, actually I am",7
Damn,3
"KKR: Plays like shit with the lowest score ever

He was a goner as well,2
Thank god we don't have the worst powerplay score this year.,4
CSK all out in ten ! Doing what never done before,2
Four four four,2
Boult is not siraj to get 2 maidens lol.,4
Lol bumrah conceded a boundary. PATHETIC,5
Why didn't that fielder even react when ball  went past?,1

Put in 9 slips already you cowards,6
Csk need players like hussey or badrinath kind of players who can bat well in this kind of situation.,2
C A L C U L A T E D,1
Same theme in every match. Dhoni and Jaddu fighting to stay in the game. Except that they have more than 100 balls to play. Would be boring for a while,2
Holy fuck I can't....that was close,1
Am I watching Tennis or Cricket,3
Can't remember the last time I saw MSD batting in the powerplay.,3
"Dehnier strike rate 200, absolutely no match",6

Just imagine the NRR boost!,3
"If that slip fielder was well placed, it could have been 5/5",9
Is 3-4 the worst score in ipl history ?,7
This is called El Clasico? Lol,7
Ishant vs ktk had similar vibes. Score was 11-6 at a point. 2 csk players were in that ktk team. Guess who?,1
"MS, please.",8
Dhoni: Let me show the youngsters how to edge the ball. Ffs!,7
Beautifully pierce the gap by Sir Dhoni he is heart and soul of csk,7

Kkr fans: first time?,11
"This scoreline against mumbai after the disastrous season has to be nail in the coffin of this squad.

Wholesale changes expected and needed for csk come next auction.",1

"Okay, this is just sad to watch now.",3
Dhoni looks more lean today,2
Strategic edge to boundary!,3
I keep waking up and thinking I'm dreaming in this tournament.,1
This is being played in Sharjah lmao,2

It's WC 2019 semi-final revisited,4
Imagine if the CRED Payer of the Match is a CSK fan,1
idk if it's a morale loss or what but how the fuck did csk go from beating mi by 5 wickets in the first match to now this?,1
When 6 people have batted and 4 is the highest score lmao,1
how not the turntables,2
My piss lasted longer than CSK’s top order.,3
Damn that was a good shot,7
"I want to join in the fun so bad but something makes me think I probably shouldn't. Idk what, can't quite put my finger on it.",4
There cones the spark,2
That was a good shot,2
Old Dhoni could still win the match for the team.,3
Someone (bumrah) has to get 5fer in this surely,4
This will be dhoni's day - he has jadeja as partner + 17 more overs to play : I predict 150 total,4

First the 'Spark-less' youngsters got out for duck

Dhoni stared down youngsters to get out asap so he can save face /s,1
Csk all out at 40. You heard it here first,2

CSK bby pls steal RCB's record thx,5
That wasn’t a boundary that was a flex,1
Arya gurukul vs KC Gandhi incoming,6
What does thala mean?,3
This whole thing is a setup to make Dhoni look good,6
"For all the whining about them, I haven't seen a single ""tHaLa fan"" in this thread",2
guys don't worry this was all part of Dhoni's plan to get back in form,6

where have we seen this before?",14

Bumrah&Bolt : Say no more.",13
"Dhoni : ""Fine, I'll do it myself""",5
I thought it couldn't get any worse ....,2
"Others: Just tuned in - WTF?

CSK Fans: Been watching from the first over - WTF?!",11

"Honestly bruh, r/Cricket can't complain about Dhoni after this shit.",21
Csk fan for these many years.. happy to see this team burn.. enough of thala and Srini mama fuckery,4
This could very well have happened to SRH if Jofra was given a 3rd over yesterday.,9
No wonder mi chose to field,3
I just want a dhoni show that's all.,8
Tbh this situation is tailor made for an MSD rearguard. He is damn good at it too.,7
"Dhoni rn : Have to rescue the team and shore up CSK like I shored up India when they were 29-5 vs Pakistan  
  
Thala : This is Sharjah. Even if I can make a score @s/r130 then I can  play a martyr and throw the juniors under the bus again.Might be able to play another IPL and sign a clutch of new deals with Oppo.",7
Why are Dhoni and Jadeja opening guys?,8
"No one:

CSK batsman: lemme smash a wide ball to a slip",6
"4 wickets before powerplay, Coulter Nile on the team, the stage is set for 49-10",12
"Dhoni looking like a car hitting a guard rail after those 2 boundaries, sparking up",6
KKR : There is another,8
Only a Jadeja special can better the mood tonight,4
"if jadeja and dhoni stay around, we can still come up with at least 120",2
Time for Dhoni to play that one innings that makes his fans jizz but eventually makes no difference in the tournament,7
Can we just reach 100 pls,7
Raina enjoying the view from balcony,4
Who is the better captain? Rohit or pollard?,1
BUMRAH IS TRASH /s,3
Don't forget CSK finished 1st and 2nd (by thinnest of margins) in last 2 seasons. What a fall from grace. Its like Liverpool/Man City getting relegated in the PL.,4
Csk tryna get all the records in the game,4
CSK showing some Intent,8
Dhoni showing intent,11
I'd love to see the face of r/cricket if dhoni hits a hundred today,18
Guess CSK found their best opening combination,6
Can they outperform KKR. They need to stop at 83,7
"After some crazy high scores at the start of the tournament, it’s gone completely the other way in the last few games.",8
"Good From Bumrah here, let them get to 150-160",3
1st ipl century for dhoni and 1st triple century in T20 for Jadeja incoming,4
No spark at all,0
Dhoni bats more aggressively when the team is 4 down in the third over in the first innings than he does when they need 60 in the last 4. Love this man,36
Bumrah's just a shit Siraj,-5
"Dhoni and Jaddu to open next match, *fuck it*",8
"Lol when he finally gets a situation which demands tuk tuk , madlad Dhoni strikes at 200",88
CSK slogan for 2020: Don't let your memes be memes. Make them your team.,4
Empire strikes back,5
CSK should change their theme song to Hello Darkness My Old Friend,2
Proud to see the team counter attacking even from this postion. Win or lose the intent is there!,8
I can’t wait for Dhoni fans coming up with absurd arguments to support him today. It’s gonna be fun,1
"Holy shit 3 boundaries in the over, I thought this wouldn't happen till the 20th over.",10
"INB4, Dhoni and Jaddu score a 100\* each and shit on r/cricket",18
Dhoni century today,3
Dhoni will be exhausted playing all 20overs,5
"Most people : lowest score ever coming up 


CSK Fans : Dhoni century coming in / Jadeja Century coming in. 180+ 


Me : This is a fucking CSK game, they'll get to a boring ol 100-120.",62
ngl dhoni has rock solid defence. sadly defence and tuk tuk don't fetch you runs.,7
Chennai Super Cunted,1
I'll genuinely be satisfied with 50,7
Take Bumrah off already. Net bowler /s,2
Dick thala would mean dick head?,4
"*Dhoni scoring more than youngsters combined*

Can Csk pass the 49 run mark,4
Duh,3
"Twitter is a weird place, saw some Rohitians wanting MI to lose. WTF",2
"this is amazing

as a Mumbai indians fan and a huge Dhoni fan

A nice Dhoni 100, final score around 130

Easy Mumbai win",14
Bumrah != Siraj,7
Bruh how tf we let them beat us by ten wickets lol. The one time they go all guns blazing smh,8
Siraj did what this shit has done even better. What a fraud,0
"Not sure what is the bigger surprise, CSK 18-4 or Dhoni 9* (5)",12
Jesus 13 off that...felt like another world honestly.,5
Bums wants RCB to retain the 49 meme title.,8

"Wth, i was preparing sadness thread",1
"All this talk about CSK but how well have Boult and Bumrah bowled. 

Usually Bumrah gets over no. 5 and Boult and NCN/Pattinson open the bowling. 

This was a really good move by Pollard and the team management.",6
"*2k for 24 balls, holy fuck!*",3
Anticipating a Jadeja 50 today.,1
I think Bumrah could try out a suprise Yorker or two in the powerplay as well.  Batsmen would be hardly expecting then.,1
When my friends in the CSK Whatsapp group were hoping for 4/4 and 7/7 I don't think they mean this lol,7
Dhenier to r/Cricket: Ay Bhosidike positive intent mil gaya?,9
Genuine Q. Will jag and rit be chosen after this?,3
"MI, please get CSK out for less than 49.",7
"Didn't even realise this was at Sharjah

This just got funnier ngl",7
I just want to see a good competitive game of cricket today,6
Bumrah showing he's no Lord Siraj.,6
Boult and Bumrah opening the bowling can only be improved by Siraj and Siraj,8
Just the perfect script for Dhoni,4
Can't believe all that happened in just 4 overs!!,4

"OOTL, whats the thing about ""spark"" going on?",1
I want CSK to score just 50 runs.,5

Shalu is actually Shinde,7
Man the Indian team and MI are really blessed to have a bowler of Bumrah's caliber.,7
Dhoni 105(60) incoming,1
WTF where is Boult,2
"Oh come on, use boult and pick another",4
Looks like Dhoni was right about the youngsters not showing a spark...,3
In before r/cricket wants Pollard to replace Kohli as the Indian T20 captain,6
Why the fuck is he bringing on budget Ajay Devgn now !?!,2
"Guys, I went for 12 minutes for Godess pooja, what happened? Tsunami? What is that score??😳😳",2
Cricket noob here. Bails went off but it wasn't out?,2
Krunal Pandya has punchable face.,2
"seeing the rayadu dismissal replay, get the feeling that he gives a sum total of 0 fucks and just wants to go home",2
Just cross 49 pls,0
"*Dhoni hits a four*

Bhakts: Is he the greatest cricketer ever?",2
Please wanna see Dhoni's 100.,1
My heart stopped when the wickets flashed,3
Are you fucking kidding me with Krunal Pandya after that start? At least give Boult another ffs,3
"*”I wanted them to show some spark, they lit up a fucking fire”*- dhoni, probably",6
QdK trying to stump Dhoni lel,3
💥,1
"CSK outdoing us, noice.",1
A question...if a guy gets hit wicket on wide...is it out??,3
Why Krunal Pandya rn?,1
Dhoni was right after all. No spark,1
"I bet at least 3 people are getting Dhoni apology threads ready

One for sparks, one for age, and one if they actually win lol",1
De Kock is so long it disturbed the stumps,4
"My heart, I thought it was a hit wicket.",2
Should have gone for the kill. Spinners won't scare Dhoni or Jaddu,3
[deleted],2
Rollercoaster 5rpo,2
damn dhoni striking close to 200 when team is 4 down for 20 😄,3
MI letting them get away.,4
Dhoni is seriously hard to  dismiss if he doesn't want to get out even at this stage in LOI. Phenomenal,6
lol thought he hit wicket,3
Ngl actually glad the spark comments aren't everywhere now lol,4
CSK squad just counting days to their last match so they can fuck off home,3
KKR are you watching,8
Thala with 180 SR 😎,6
"Lmao Chennai, you guys are even worse the us.",3
KG stats are nuts. 22 matches 46 wickets since 2018,4
should've given Boult a third?,2
[deleted],8
"Even being a csk fan, first three overs were beautiful to watch. Nice bowling.",9
I believe in srini mama,5
I predict Dhoni will make 100 at strike rate of over 130. Jadeja will score 70+,1
Wtf is MI doing. This is NOT how you get a team out for below 49,9
Has there ever been as overrated a player as Dhoni is? Ever?,-6
"My sister is an extreme Dhoni fanatic and these were her words after today's collapse

""see that's why he's THE THALA, say sorry to Dhoni first now""

because I was furious at Dhoni's spark comment.",14
Bowl Coulter Nile ffs,5
"AB de Villiers, the only obstacle between MI and the IPL trophy this year IMO.",5
"Dhoni and Jadeja get together to watch Sachin and Dravid or Jayawardene and Sanga bat together. Dhoni turns to Jadeja, Jadeja already looking at Dhoni. Their eyes meet, heads nodding in agreement.

"End of career for:

Watson
Jadhav 
CSKs Ego",10
Pollard captain? What happened to Rohit?,1
"Atleast take single wtf
Absolute madlad",3
Weak captaincy from Pollard,0
Wtf is this! I just woke up.,6
Dhoni's teams on their last legs have a more 'resigned to our fate' kind of vibe than a 'we'll go down fighting' one. Saw it with our test team in 2011 too.,3
No doubt Polly's gonna take the ball himself and ball his 4 overs quota. 😁,8
I hate it here,5
Kinda worried the failure of Jagd and Gaikwad will kind of push people onto accepting what Dhoni said last night...,4
Desperately want a typical thala knock...,3
All the criticism Dhoni got for not rating the younger players aged like milk.,8
Dhoni is gonna bring his strike rate down... Chill out guys,2
"Honestly idgaf if they waste balls, just don't get out ffs.",7
Dhoni arriving in the second over is like Santa arriving for Diwali. It is nice to see but the timing is weird.,185
If Dhoni is that good in tuk tuk why doesn't he play test matches?   /s,7
Perfect match for Dhoni to do his tuk tuk and take CSK beyond 49 in 20 overs,7
Dhoni has zero confidence while playing spin.,3
Dhoni can play as many dot balls as he wants. He would love this scenario.,9
Wasn't there an India vs England ODI game where Dhoni and Jadeja similarly got India out of the shit from like 40-4?,3
"If I believe Dhoni will make a century, which fantasy app can I use to make money out of this?",3
Dhoni auditioning for the Test team. Did he forget he retired years ago?,1
"Csk are suffering without Jadhav. Now what do you have to say haters?


/s",7
Man how dumb to take the pacers off and get fucking Krunal in to the attack.,4
Should have gone with another Fast bowler & go for the kill instead of hiding Krunal when CSK is under pressure just because its Sharjah,2
Pollard is generally a very attacking captain. Strange that Boult is not given another one.,5
Dhoni back to 100 SR,4
Pollard has learned from Smith to be kind enough to not kill the opposition when they're down by taking off Boult.,8
"Slightly unrelated. Anyone remember the time when Albie was running between wickets for csk, tossed his bat through and jumped with his hands into his side?

Umpire decided to give not out and told him not to repeat next time if memory serves me right",7
I bet KKR fans are in glee rn,7
I support Madrid and Chennai ! Yes that’s the joke and reality,10
Nice forward defence in the **powerplay**,5
Want Bumra to throw some helmet and toe crushers before he takes them out,6
[deleted],12
Dhoni treating krunal pandya like he is rashid khan.,12
"As a KKR fan, I thought star sports were showing the repeat telecast of the yesterday's match.",11
They really should aim for 35-40 by end of powerplay,7
Thala remembering his best test innings.,3
lol,2
Gulshan Grover bowled a good first over,7
"Mark Nicholas saying Dhoni defending against a spinner with mid on up is unseen stuff dkm

Man used to dance down the wicket to play a forward defence",11
Tailor made for Thala  to play a test knock.,8
"I know a captain shouldn't say that his players don't have spark as that can really demoralize them and that was wrong of Dhoni.

But Dhoni has always groomed many players in CSK for Team India as well. He definitely wasn't just making stuff up when he said that the youngsters this year aren't as good as other years. 

Oh well, plenty of time for Gaikwad to improve I guess.",11
Dhoni and lef-arm-off spinners quickly finishing over. Either batting of bowling,3
MI letting them off the hook with spin I think,0
Why is Pollard captain? Is Rohit injured?,2
If you look at my comment history I predicted I will bully csk tomorrow I am sorry csk peeps,3
[Something something spark...](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSZn4p-IWbJgwx7aNCDn6poLV8FBSRz2PZ93Q&usqp=CAU),5
"To be fair, if you were writing the movie of Dhonis redemption, after all the stick he’s taken recently...this is how it would start..

It would then be a couple of hours of flashbacks to the happy time’s, then people telling him he’s past it, him in the nets trying everything to get into form and missing it all all intercut with little snippets of this innings...

Before the big finale of him launching the attack in the last 5 overs and going to a century and CSK winning.

This however, is not a movie sooooo 46(49) incoming.",11
r/Cricket gonna get shit on by Thala fans today.......and honestly we deserve it after this shit lol.,4
Conspiracy theory: Rituraj and Jagadeeshan were forced to play bad by Dhoni as his 'no spark' comment had received backlash,-7
What happened to Rohit Sharma?,2
"Dhoni yeeting Bumrah and blocking Krunal, Lol what ?",5
These threads really are something,2
I fear the same fate awaits CSK next season since Mega Auction is postponed by one year.,3
" Batsman hits the stumps : out


Bowler hits the stumps : no ball 


Wicket keeper hits the stumps : let me just put the bails back on. And walk away like nothing ever happened.",7

"If Dhoni gets outs soft here or doesn't hit a reasonable innings, surely that's his career over",3

Probably had to shell out Flipkart coupons along  with Amazon Vouchers",7

"Jadhav isn’t playing and CSK have totally collapsed, this is not a drill, it’s factual",13
The comments are coming faster than ever today,10
Gonna dress up as CSK’s horrifying batting lineup this Halloween,149
"Bumrah is in great rhythm, hopefully he keeps it up during the Australian tour",4
LMAO,4
"Hopefully Dhoni gives the youngsters the same level of chances that jadhav and Watson got, would be stupid to drop them after 1 bad performance",3

"**5.2** Boult to Jadeja, OUT, **straight to midwicket.** Short of a length and just outside off, steps out at that and pulls. But this got tight on him and the pull comes of the toe-end of the bat and floats harmlessly for Krunal at midiwicket **21-5**

CaN cSk StIlL qUaLiFy?!?!,3
"CSK in the huddle: guys, I wanna break KKR record this year for the lowest total of the IPL. If we're gonna fail we're gonna fail right.",3
Sam curran innings of a lifetime.,2
Mumbai going to send Boult and Bhumra to bat first also,3
CSK's best player now,2
48 all out is definitely possible here,3
"Dear Boult, We are already dead inside.",3
"This was ideal platform for Jadhav-Dhoni partnership. 

CSK missing Jadhav",4

"Dhoni : stabs an umpire 





Umpire : that'll be 11 fair play points lads",8
Who would have thought giving Boult 3rd over when he was swinging the ball would work,2
Adios bois. See you next year,8
"People here making tuk tuk comments lol, what do you want him to do?",5
Realistic final score prediction?,2
Lmao what a clusterfuck,3
Yes finish Boult’s over while the ball is new.,2
Harbhajan and Raina just chilling in their home watching this shitshow,6

Like watching the fall of Manchester United ...,4
"To any CSK fans watching, I feel for ya😔😔😔",2
Guys we can copy paste RCB KKR memes. Just edit MI CSK into them.,2
First time in the history of IPL CSK lost 5 wickets in the PP,1
Would love to watch kris breakdown now. Can someone watching translate what he is saying right now!,2
"Pls break the 49 record csk machas, make us proud",5
"CSK fans must be living in unbelievable state.. we all expected the team to fall down a bit with senior citizen selections. But, this is unbelievable even for a neutral like me.. and painful. 

I want CSK to give a fight, to show competitiveness at least. Can't go on blaming Dhoni for everything, playing 11 has ten other players who need to carry the blame for the dismal performance.

Come on Sam, show me some fight.",7
"Wtf was Jaddu doing? With no Batting left, could've got set and he can do some damage latter.",2
Boult gunning for the Cred PowerPlayer of the Match Award,3

Inb4 thala trial for India vs Australia test series,3
I'll change my flair to CSK for the duration of this IPL if CSK get bowled out for less than 49.,3
Sam curran as a PP pinch hitter anyways.,1
Csk ready to break our record😤💯,2
I love Trent Boult. Gives us a six every now and again and is just a fantastic pace bowler.,2
[deleted],5
Sell the franchise,1
Sam Curran main batsman in. Get him out early and 49 lowest score will be in trouble,2
CSK is a reflection of Dhoni and his failure,1
"Csk fans ,now u know how does it feel to be a rr fan",1
Now CSK's lower order will be facing MI's lethal pace battery. I think I'll die laughing. This is so satisfying to watch!,2
"INB4, Someone shouts at MI: ""Bade Budho ki izzat kara karo""

T: Respect your elders",4
CSK please. Stay below 49.,2
CSK didn't want to be one upped by KKR's last Performance,2
Ngl Jaddu getting out hurt. He was in form batter,2
"Guys, it's all coming together today, all stars are aligned and something crazy is going to happen at the end of the match",1
So nice of all these guys to make sure Sam Curran still gets a chance to bat in PP despite being demoted to 7.,5
Inb4 dhoni plays 20(80) to ensure moral victory,4
Sam spent a solid minute there marking his guard lmao,1
aa gya mera Curran,2
Most wickets in a powerplay?,3
An English all rounder coming in in a helpless situation...CSK win pretty much guaranteed.,3
"Sweet redemption. So many years CSK fans gave RCB fans shit (I am RCB and KXIP, my flair KXIP because it's more karnataka than RCB), and were constantly being full of themselves on my facebook. this is fucking sweet redemption.",5
"Boult goes in, batsman goes out. Can't explain that",3
for the first time ever i was rooting for csk and this happens ffs,10
MI to get prosecuted for elder abuse,10
Watson and Bravo probably chuckling at the performance!,6
Csk bat so deep lol,6
This team is so garbage smh this mega auction can’t come fast enough,4
This looks an awful lot like Sam Curran opening with extra steps,8
Lungi whistle podu warriors destroyed by amchi  vadapav indians lol,4
Holy Sh*t.. 21/5 what's going on with CSK,3
Anyone watching this? 😀😀,3
RCB Fans seriously how much will it hurt if your meme tag is taken over by CSK! Isn't that your pride?,5
This is even worse than KKR considering that it's Sharjah.,7
This must be the best day in r/cricket's life. Their favorite punching bag is down and completely bit the dust.,8
Fuck I forgot about Samuel!,1
 Bc why is Rohit looking this thicc today,1
Thala please make 30 more,1
Scriptwriters have gone too far,5
Is this too much intent :/,2
"Bruh, rcb fans ke mu me pani aa raha hoga",3
CSK missing Jadhav.,3
Gendaswami it seems is in for Rohit.,0
Lord Curran some fantasy points please,4
Jadeja doing Jadeja things.,3
They are dealing in 4s and wickets,5
"Imagine if you told 13 year old Sam Curran after the 2011 final that he’d be in the middle at 22-5, having to rebuild with MS Dhoni at the other end",11
Bowl out Boult Bumrah and Coulter Nile please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,4
"If you gonna loose, make it memorable one. 🖤",3
"Imagine being Dhoni now. 

I wouldn't be able to stand up digesting this!",4
In b4 Sam Curran 100(20),4
"The importance of one great bowler in a team goes well beyond the the wickets taken by that bowler. When you have Bumrah in your team, the death overs are well taken care of. So Boult can bowl in the powerplay which is his strength and not in the death where he is vulnerable. Other teams forced Boult to bowl in the death because they lacked another bowler of Bumrah’s quality, so Boult’s figures were affected.",4
"Jadeja gets a chance to finally get a 60+ score, rather than those 20+ & 30+ he's used to, but as always flattered to decieve.",3
pOsItiVe iNTeNt from Jadeja there tbf,3
Can we just agree that both the youngsters and the veterans are shit,2
This sad and funny. 😕,3
"Real nemesis of *Indians* is out there.

Little cunt to score 84(53)",7
What the hell is going on with CSK?!,1
"if your main guys are failing consistently, you select your best from your bench. The squad selection is already done during auction, now is not the time to judge the spark in players. If you dont like them, then complain to your auction team for next year.

This whole spark comment from Dhoni was lame justification for team's failures.",5
At least we have a superior T20 competition in the WBBL beginning in 9hrs,6
Looks like Curran was opening after all,5
"Last batsman in the team before the bowlers

Barring lord thakur himself ofc",4
"I pray for all Csk players, some of those toxic Csk fans gonna be ruthless on social media now",14
dHoNi classic 30(80) would actually be useful now,13
Curran walking out to bat in the power play like normal...,24
This is ain't no luck. Fans will do anything to defend their team. This is pure bowling masterclass,10
I feel for CSK fans man.... They are not used to this time of humiliation,5
If you want Curran in powerplay just send him to open why all this drama,8
Haha is Hardik having a midlife crisis already?,4
Ouch just turned it on. What happened?,1
Is MI too good or is CSK too shit,9
Jadhav wouldn't be bad here imo!,1
"###########################
65 million years. Zap",1
CSK was the impostor among us,5
One way or the other you can't keep Sam Curran out of the powerplay,4
first time in IPL history CSK lost 5 wickets in the powerplay ~ cricbuzz,4
Kohli and the bois manifesting for CSK 48/10,6
I bet Kedar would have played a great knock.,2
The plan was to make Sam Curran open all along,6
Collapse: I am *SPEED*,2
CSK It's Sharjah for fucks sake,6
Why in the fuck are people complaining about tuk tuk here. Look at the scoreline ffs,4
that's not a goddamn wide,2
Csk's nrr go brrr,7
"Pitch doesn't even look bad lmao

It's quicker than it's looked recently as well",6
"Jokes aside, I think Dhoni still has the capability of taking them to a somewhat respectable total it’s just that he has lost the intent of hitting",1
Got to love Mark Nicholas ramming home the point that this is a FLAT wicket.,4
####There's no spark in youngsters,2
Already waiting for Dhoni's post match interview. Going to be fiery as fuck lmao.,3
[deleted],10
"At the end of the game, MI's NRR going to swell up a lot.",6
Press F for the CSK fan with the calculator who did the monster _canCSKqualify_ math yesterday,5
"Wow, these CSK players can go to this extent to make dhoni look good.  /s",3
CSK deliberately played shit to get Curran bat in the power play. MI took the bait of picking 5 wickets.,6
Honestly Thakur hasn't got the chance to bat this year and this is his chance 😍,5
Who is opening for MI today,1
Jadhav bhaiya hote toh ...tod dete mi ko,6
So are we playing for quantum of loss today ?,1
Meanwhile CSK fans like me - Guess I'd die,1
All this is only happening because Hardik is bald now,3
"CSK: 3/4

r/cricket: will team fold under 48

stream: r/cricket so stupid

Jaddu: hold my beer",10
Csk will probably have to dump the majority of their team in the mega auction,2
Sanga and Mark Nicholas piling it on lol,3
Just checking in. Looks like the spark has died and buried 6000 ft under earth.,8
"CSK are just poor now. Dhoni has been out of form for years. He is way past it. But now that is visible because of the rest of the team has shat the bed as well. Because like Dhoni those guys are aging as well. 

And they are not in India where they can doctor their home pitch to their strengths. 

Let’s not make this about Dhoni’s comments about youngsters. The whole team looks deflated. You can’t shit on them in public. Not give them a chance until the tournament is gone. And then expect them to kill it  right away against bowlers like Bumrah and Boult.",10
Jadhav would be good here,0
Bring in Chahar and take Thala wicket!,2
New el classico between csk and kkr,5
Hitman is like meri captaincy khatre me hai,9

####THERE'S NO SPARK IN YOUNGSTERS,11
Just tuning in. Wtf happened here? 5 down already?,2
During the Ceat strategic timeout CSK are probably just gonna whistle.,3
"I really think that at this point, Deepak Chahar should've been sent out. That was Sam Curran will have a chance to play when things have calmed down somewhat from this and Dhoni and Chahar can rotate strike in the early middle overs.",2
"I've seen enough this IPL.


Now I want to wake up from my dream.",5
Now CSK will play for NRR.,2
"Lol Sangakkara has sounded so bored by all of this so far. Even after Jagadeeshan got out and Pommie was going crazy, the next voice you heard was Kumar, super bored, basically saying ""yeah, decent ball that"". I don't mind it though.",7

First test match under lights at Sharjah.,9
Batting collapses are so pleasing to watch. Sheer bowling brilliance.,12
If they wanted Sam Curran to open they coulda just done that from the start instead of taking the long route,11
*THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST COMMENTED THREAD IN R/CRICKET!*,3
Mark Nicholas just called Ruturaj Faf du Plessis 🤦🏾‍♂️,5
Commentators need to stop waxing lyrics about Dhoni and Fleming. They need to do well at the auction if they are to do well next year. This team is well past it's prime.,4

"Curran be like: This is nothing, I have had to rescue England from greater batting collapses in the test team",6
Just shows how valuable Raina is.,2
There really is no spark in these youngsters lol,3
"I know Dhoni is past his best and it’s kind of the cool thing to shit on him atm, but I really don’t know what people here expect him to do when his team were 3-4.",6
Does CSK regret releasing Billings?,3
Most unbelievable thing is *this is Sharjah where Sanju gets trolled for scoring runs*....,6
Fade me fam,2
You know the best part of this collapse? Google comments are freaking out and not posting Nikola Tesla wikipedia biographies  for the first time in three seasons,2

I hope, don’t allow this to jinx you Sam...",6
Just turned on TV. Why am I not surprised seeing this score? It's been a tough week for teams batting first,5
sangakara commentary is just wonderful,5
"KKR : 84 😎 

CSK : Hold my sparks",8
I have not watched but was Dhoni’s spark rant justified? This was the best time for the young uns to prove themselves.,5

I've been in UAE since two months, waited 10 games to play.

I won't even get to bowl my 4 overs 🤦🏽",19
Dhoni to bat deep and end at 33 off 78 balls not out. Thala.,5
If i was in Dhoni's place I'd just concede the match here and go home. There no redeeming factor in this team. Just take another break and prepare for the next ipl now.,1
That was some spell from Trent Boult: 3 overs 1 maiden 5 runs 3 wickets.,3
Boggles my mind how Jadhav doesn't get out easily but these people do,4
Finally dhoni can play a quick fire 60 ball 50. I once argued with someone in this sub who thought a 60 ball 50 by dhoni was better than a 40 ball 60 by buttler because it took more effort on dhoni's side.,5

What happened? The players didn't get their pension this month?,3
"Honestly as a CSK fan , when you have given up for the season and you have no expectations this doesnt even hurt. Strange feeling this. Looking forward to Chahar and Thakur bat.",2

"Here's my tinfoil hat theory with zero evidence . Dhoni most likely had Covid 19 and suffered permanent hit to his form and ability because of that.

Dhoni was found panting and coughing in a few matches and has had horrid form. Can't even hit past the first few fielders in some matches. It's also very questionable how only Gaikwad and Chahar had corona, but didn't transfer it to anyone else before testing positive

. Csk and their management knows that Dhoni being revealed covid positive and the side effects he sustained would heavily kill their image. Have a feeling they're hiding it. Sure he hit a couple boundaries today, but he was looking off for a lot of shots",10
Well yall wanted to see intent from Dhoni,11
Wager a <49?,7
So I can sleep at 10pm today,7
Let's go less than 48 please!!!,8

Commentators are going to praise Chahar way too much for doing something every leg-spinner does nowadays - tossing it up even after getting hit. It's not a novelty or even brave anymore,2

"SR > 100 and probably highest run scorer for the team.

Good contribution considering the situation.",3
Surely something is sus here. No fucking way are CSK this shit.,5
Dhoni gets out these days when he gets aggressive. This is why he prefers to play it safe until the last over.,10
RCB dugout: Nobody fucking move!!,5
Pls someone dismiss Sam Curran and end CSK misery,2
Everything comes to an end. Doesn't it?,1
30/6. They're gonna beat KKR for lowest total,2
Tahir 10fer incoming.,3
At.this point this seems like this is on purpose. I mean the batsman might as well just step away from the wicket and allow themselves to get stumped,1
Somebody predicted earlier in this thread that Dhoni would hit a six and then get out next ball.,2
Sam Curran needs a David Miller vs RCB type innings here,2

Brave and courageous innings by Dhoni. He single handedly try to wrestle back momentum and delivered half the teams runs by himself. Unfortunate for him to sacrifice his natural game to cover the failings of glorified gully crickets ahead of him,-4
"Alright, which one will reach 10 first, wickets or the overs",9
The end of the KINGS!,5
Bowl Boult and Boom.,1
"Raunak Kapoor: "" One cheeky man this Dhoni, when team is 39-2 he plays at stike rate of 80 till 19th over but today when team was 30-5 he plays too aggressively. At this point we Indians should return all those ICC trophies, shouldn't we? """,1
After this match there is no way any team will have more nrr than mi,4
Dhoni is also learning to lose. He didn't attack Krunal in the power play but decided to go ape shit when Chahar came in.,5
"Are the two Chahars related? I thought they were, but  surely it'd be mentioned on comms if so",4
"Dhoni is like fuck this.

I m gonna drink 3 litres milk in the dressing room.",5

Rooting for a csk win at the start but this is even better. What a mess. Lol. Humiliation.,5
"I was smiling up until now, now I just feel bad",5
I want them to lose all the remaining matches so that they retire the team and start from scratch. But holy shit this is appalling. Dhoni goes about it like an ODI chasing 200+ and gets out playing attacking cricket when the team is at 20-5,5
"Coulter-Nile, better known as the architect of the 49 all out. MI needs more of a de Grandhomme now though",5

We always talk about how Brohit might be a better LOI captain than Koach but I don't rhink Rohit is even the best captain within MI,13
Genuine genuine Q. Csk more or less had same players as 2019 but the form became so dreadful within an year. How?,8
So it's Chahar vs Chahar,1
This is in a way much needed for CSK. A rebuild has been the need of the hour for years now. Hopefully they take the tough call and scrap off everybody except the youngsters and build again,2
CSK's target 20 runs,2
Please bring on Bumrah.,2
Meanwhile Sam and Deepak hit 50s with 170 runs partnership,4

I get why Dhoni kept Jadhav. Jesus fucking christ.,8
How is this the CSK team that won in 2018? This team hasn't shown any form of competition except for their literal first game against MI. This CSK team looks like it would play tuk tuk against some E grade team on an astro pitch.,6

Your daily reminder: IPL 2021 is 6 months away and CSK's cup lifting moment is 8 months away.,4
seeing CSK struggling like RCB at the bottom of the table and RCB like record. While RCB is at the top. This is 2020 for you.,3
Every single hurts.,2
CSK fans went from cheering their team to win the cup to cheering their team to get to 50,6
Csk's best batsman is here,1
6 runs to win with 3 wickets remaining.,5
I wanted Chennai to lose but not like this. I honestly feel bad for them and their fans right now,5
Definitely time to Bowl out Boult and Bumrah. I'd be mad otherwise.,7
Cmon MI give us a sub 49 meme,8
Lmao rcb fans watching this with bated breath,1
Chahar gets Chahar out. So poetic,3
Give csk the fair play award if they get out for <49,4
These motherfuckers deliberately called the timeout with a ball remaining just so they could squeeze a few more ads in there.,9
Shardul still sees Malinga's face in his nightmares,2

Just 6 more runs. Please. Get to 50.,7
Pollard you coward get Boult on,1
Just end the misery now,-1
Remember when CSK v/s MI used to be this really competitive big deal? I've just switched off my phone now. Glad I'm not watching this with my MI friends.,3
I know the guys who hate Dhoni is shitting on him unrelently this season! As his fan I'd say I can live with that! But attributing luck to the rest of his achievements because of this season is the worst bit of shitposting ever!,10
Just bring Bumrah and Boult,4

That was fun while it lasted. A team getting all out for 49 looks like the toughest record to beat.,3
RCB fans worried about top 2? Hahaahahaah count your fucking blessings that the calculators are not being used this season lmao,-5
Bond is one diligent dude,1
Really puts into perspective how bad RCB played that night,10
"ok, where the fuck is that chika",1
Now cross 84 guys u can do it xD,1
Curran must be fun at the parties /s,4
They'll somehow manage to sneak in 3 more timeouts,3
https://twitter.com/ChennaiIPL/status/1319653310689767424,1
I want CSK tonplay out all 10 overs and make 15 runs or so. Would make it hilarious. They should play like a test match for trolling.,3
What the hell happened here today. For fucsk.,2
Actually RCB should retain the extremes of 49 and 263 to remain the ultimate meme team.,9
"Wow these guys might overtake 82 too, absolute madlads",1
Pollard taking foot off the gas. Bring in Bumrah.,2
[removed],11
"Lol and I thought that Rajasthan were crap yesterday. 51/7 at Sharjah is awful.

Curran continuing to be a pest to “Indians” (this time the Mumbai Indians). I do kinda wish that Mumbai had rolled them for less than 49 though, would sum up 2020’s craziness so well",8
Sorry RCB fans. Not today.,8
It's gotten so bad the CSK bench is now applauding singles,10
CSK NRR today : not stonks,4
Never in the History of RCB were we this bad 🤭🤭,9
If the year 2020 could be summarized in an innings of cricket it would be this Chennai innings,4
Poori team langda rahi hai par apne Curran bhaiyya abhi bhi bhangda kar rahe hai...,5
"The Run rate is actually OK by CSK standards, just the wickets have fallen O.O",8
That 3 Idiots Raju ad is so annoying fuck off,5
Dhoni just had to give strike to Curran.,1
Glad CsK crossed 49 to beat RCB. Cause they sure as hell will never cross 263,10
CSK really wants to go back to the hotel ASAP and finish watching Mirzapur Season 2.,10
"Curran is a good player.  
They can build CSK 2.0 around him...Chahar...maybe Jaddu/Faf for a few years but the rest of the old boys need to go.  
That includes you Thala",3
Guys rohit just told Pollard in the timeout not to bring back bumrah and boult and make sure csk cross 49. Rift between rohit and kohli confirmed.,129
I’ve just seen the scorecard. CSK fans are you guys okay?,9
Honestly it was a pity Curran got out early during the DC game. He's the only one with any spark.,9
Unpopular opinion: I don't want anyone to break our 49/10 record. Highest score and lowest score record should be with RCB for true meme team status.,249
"I don't even like Sam Curran in general, but damn, he deserves a much better team than this.",8
CSK should pull off some HaryanaHurricanes type of shit if they need to good in 2021,3
100 is a moral victory right? Just let Sam Curran smoke some big sixes as consolation. Please,6
I think Sam Curran is becoming my favorite non-Indian cricketer.,19
Thakur can bat well. CSK is getting 110+ here,1
Pollard giving chance to CSK? Why not bring in Boult or Bumrah now?,5
I know we're giving wicket to all the bowlers but wouldn't it be easier if you bring bumrah .,2
Normal people get excited about 69. Cricket fans get excited about 49.,95
bruh just get back bumrah and boult and finish them off,6
Do Australian know that Ricky ponting has the most punchable in cricketing world.,-5
Lord Curran gonna get them to 200,7
"Following Dhoni's controversial statement, CSK players created so much spark that whole team is burning down.",25
[removed],6
"Pollard should have brought Boult & Bumrah back after 6 were down.  
Could have beaten RCB's 49.",6
[removed],20
Polly needs to bring in Bumrah now.. And end this,3
Standard first 10 overs score by CSK minus the wickets stop complaining csk fans,11
Curran's back is going to break carrying this team all season,7
"Lol, Sadagopan Ramesh sad about the RR in this match.",5
"iirc Shane bond was in rr. Fuck you, RR for not taking him as the coach",3
Turns out senior CSK side was better. Can't but see an analogy between MSD's CSK and Mourinho's ManU,6
Bad MI,2
Genuine question: why is Pollard holding back both Bumrah and Boult now ?,6
[CSK fans after crossing 49](https://i.imgur.com/r6z4n0e.jpg),5
"Ok, next target 84!",7
Csk fans be like: batting kidhar hai?????,5
The one time csk would have benefitted from tuk tuk. Dhoni goes for a big shot and gets out🤷‍♂️,16

Just don't let them put a respectable total on the board!,8
"Raina not being there was a big blow tbh..

Dhoni, Raina, and the Chennai pitch carried CSK all these years.

With all of them missing CSK is looking lost..",13
Jadhav will be picked next match...lmao,12
"Imagine if Curran was retained by KXIP!

Fuck, I still remember his finishing act of 55 against KKR!",11
Give Bumrah two overs and get this done with,12
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but instead of trying to hit boundaries Dhoni should've looked to tuk-tuk a few overs and build a partnership with Curran.",80
"Fam how much has Sunny G had to drink? ""**IF** Mumbai go on to win today""? There's no fucking way anyone can lose this match. Except of course CSK. They'd lose against this CSK.",12
MI should open their batting with Pollard and Pandya and just get done with this game,13
If Thakur and Curran last without getting out that'd be a great victory.,7
Good time to get into masochism,6
Sadagopan Ramesh living in a fantasy world saying our run rate will be affected by this match.,10
Where is the CSK super fan uncle lol,4
before this (and last nights game).. have we had any other collapses this season? nothing comes to mind,1
CSK getting past 49 even after this collapse makes me wonder how bad were RCB that day.,14
"Please bring back Bumrah, Pollard",7
What is the rationale in leaking singles right now,4
"Polly u ensured the 49 meme, now bowl boom and boult",8
"Honestly, I really like the qualifier concept. It doesn't let the top teams settle down and forces them to play at their best, which is what we're here to see.",11
Are we going to bowm 20 overs?  This is getting boring pls finish it,5
What exactly are they saving Bumrah and Boult for?,6
[deleted],6
Atleast Jadhav will be back for the next game vs RCB,6
"Yo, MI atleast win this match fast once you head to bat. Please don't keep me watching with hope, I'm already scarred from csk vs rr",5
"Mumbai INDIANS

cricket team of INDIA


both have trouble cleaning up oppositions tail.


COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT",15
"If RR could help you win trophy, MI would have it already",4
There should be more matches in the knockout round. 4 is too less.,3
CEAT HQ in panic because there might only be one timeout this match,8
Just bowl out bumrah and boult ffs,9
It is absolutely unacceptable that we managed to lose by 10 wickets to this team,10
Bring in boult and finish'em off,5
"When they should play tuk tuk they show intent,when they should show intent they play tuk tuk. Story of dhoni and S.Gill.",8

"[I cant believe CSK didnt buy him in the auctions, he was instrumental in CSK's wins in 2010 and 2011.](https://i.imgur.com/pjMhmiK.jpg)",10

Csk's batsmen dropped harder than India's gdp,28
Pollard always bowls when he is the captain.,9

So how did SRH lose against this team?,8

Rohit would've been more agressive,6
"Pollard: Fine, i will do it myself",9
That's what you get for disrespekting my boi Suresh raina.,5
I have a feeling MI will bottle it,-4
I miss Lord Jadhav :(,5
Really dumb opinion of mine but I would've preferred a Jadhav 30(63) considering how the dude never gets out at all. Would have got us a couple extra runs,6
Pollard coming on to bowl just to assert dominance completely,5
Is something wrong with the pitch?,4
Pollard having all the bowlers have some practice,2
"Sam Curran should be the ""only player in the playing eleven"" for CSK in the next match. BCCI should accept to field a one member playing eleven.",5
Pollard is taking pity on them.,4
Pollard said fuck it and started bowling himself,3
"Meanwhile, Thala was right.  
No spark from CSK's youngsters today.  


Thala can never be wrong. xD",4
"Opened Twitter and regretted it immediately, the number of people praising Dhoni for saying the no spark comment is mindfucking can't believe how braindead you have to be to championing every single move even if it is plain bad",22
Pollard is literally trolling now lol,3
"Jofra Archer 🤝 Sam Curran

Being fucking fed up of their team's shit",9
"Waiting for Kris Srikanth to go bonkers after match and make statements like ''This is not real CSK real CSK never landed in Dubai.""",5
Why wouldn’t you just bowl out boult and bumrah to deal with the tail?,7
Can csk just declare or something,3
Wtf. I just saw the score. Seems like kkr played better than CSK,5
NCM has some serious problem with us fucking us everytime even against or for.,2
That idiotic Spark comment will haunt Dhoni for life. Even Kohli don't make such statements.,8
"Bowling practice for others, they'll bring it bumrah and Boult for last 3 overs, if it gets there",1
Sam Curran loves batting in a team at no 6 for any opposition that has the word India in it.,1
Pollard's experience is important but no way it's more important than his batting.,6
What a fucking fuck. There was no need for you to bowl.,6
I just hope GG and Raunak isn't in the Mid Show or Post show!,1
Polly took the ball. What did I say ?  😁,6
Swanny just casually murdering Jimmy anderson,4
"Poll question: In which category is Kieron Pollard most important to MI?

..Yes",13
"The duck he keeping Bumrah for, Tahir?",7
Pollard probably has both Curran and Thakur in his Dream11 team. That's the only logic of not bowling Bumrah or Boult now.,14
That 72% Experience poll suits well for CSK players more than Pollard,5
Scenes if Tiwary comes to bowl,8

"Why is the ball not given to Bumrah and Boult to clean up the tail?

KP bowling just for LOLs.,7
"I often forget that this same team beat MI, chased down 180 with no wickets lost and scored 200 in this same season. Truly Mercurial\^TM",6

This is the time for a 2*(38) brilliancy from a very talented person in our team who isn't playing today.,19

Chahar and Bravo/Faf/ Santner via RTM(Probably neither of the first two cos they would have retired)

Bring back Ashwin and Raina in the auction ( depending on his form in the domestic tournaments and the former , well for Ethicalness)",2

Only when i dont watch half the batting team is out. Happend to me twice 1st KKR match 2nd TODAY . Aur kisko jetana he kya ?,4
We have to build around Sam,14
"Since some Dhoni fans are still finding nothing wrong with his comment, I wonder how you felt when the same was told about him when he was young?                                                    FYI Dhoni also got out for a duck on his debut.",14
Are MI looking for Batting practice? Get'em guys.... there's no death over in this match!!,4
In before krunal bowls one ball with that shitty action,10
Why hardik is not bowling?,4
That kid is saving everyone's ass.,14
"Is Pollard not killing them because he and Dhoni are good friends and he's like "" feels bad, man""",12
Sometimes I feel like Curran is the only one who does everything right,12
Bc bring in Boomz and khatam karo yar!,4
Rohit seems bored too watching this dead rubber,5
This Sam Curran dude is fkn invincible,4
Lmao the non striker actually looked back to see if he was in,2
Dhoni may say he tried to fit many sparks in the team today which resulted in Fire,3
I was planning to buy CSK jersey this season and wear it outside Chennai like a proud fan. I am scared now of people trolling me,1
"Its easy to be the cool coach (Fleming) or Captain Cool(Dhoni) when the team is winning.  
Everyone loses their cool when they're being spanked publicly. No matter what comms say, no matter what hashtags advertisers come up with",7
Genuine Q. Has there been atleast one match when Monu Kumar was played ?,3
Murali just mentioned the dad's army lmao,11
"I think the reason why they aren't bringing in Bumrah and Boult is:

""Tarbooz katega toh sab main batega""  


""A cut watermelon needs to be shared with everyone""",36
Imagine benching  players like Santner and Tahir for 10 matches.,11
Only CSK can make Sharjah look like Chepauk,11
Curran is a hard dude isn't he? Reminds me of Faf's debut innings,5
I saw this coming. Senior citizens most vulnerable to covid,5
Thakur might be playing slow but he's at least stopped the bleeding temporarily.,1
bizarre captaincy and tactics from MI management.,7
Take a fucking wicket you cowards.,1
Pollard playing out this game like a poorly designed AI that will bowl their best bowlers for the first 4 and last 4 overs. He was so much more better as a captain for T&T 😐,7
Bruh why aren't those chefs wearing their mask properly?,1
What if scriptwriters have played us and csk win?,3
I am still seething at Pollard for not going for the kill. Alas,7
What replacement player should we have signed for Raina? Maybe Marnus or Joe Root?,1
Ive been supporting KXIP and I legit thought we were gonna come last by a long margin this year.. I guess CSK had other plans,2
Oh cmon Rohit would have gone for the kill 4 overs ago,6
Tahir gonna take a 6 wicket maiden and win this game for us.,9
Only Curran and Faf come out looking decent from CSK team who've played regularly this year.,2
At least once in every freaking match Krunal will stop bowling after runup.,9
Why are we still here? Just to suffer.,14
Either get some runs on the board or be all out already. No point getting some meaningless runs if you can't defend it,2
Fixed,-2
Damnit,3
these mf'ers are deliberately dragging this on,3
"*Ruturaj n Jagadeesan - OUT*

Fanbois: Where's ""tHaLaLaLa Apology Thread""?

*Dhoni - OUT*

Fanbois: MI please end this suffering. IPL next auction. LoveDay. LaySoon.",24
eagerly looking forward to hear from bhajji and gambhir,3
Jadhav lending Thakur some of his luck in not getting out there. Just hold it and tuktuk for 3 more overs atleast please,3
Bat breaking bowling by NCN,2
Bats broken,2
69. Drop Nice in the replies,2
CSK team be like: there is 1 crewmate among us,28
Strength of the lord,7
Bad bat,4
Pollard definitely got told to take this deep for that extra moolah,3
Spring came put early before winter,2
Lord Tupac Shakur tore the bat a new one,4
Ishaan Kishan looks like a Chinese Knockoff version of Antoine Griezmann,13
Bat represents the state of CSK rn,11
CSK never played IPL 2020 ^(in India),8
Even their bats are old and falling apart.,15
The last few overs have felt so boring...didn't think I'd be saying that in a MI vs CSK match,2
**Bhajji and Gambhir: It's thrashing time**,3
Ambani tampered with the bats,5
"All of MI making sure NCN doesn’t get a wicket and gets dropped for Pattinson

/s",11
Does this match have more ads than usual???,3
I thought Ishan Kishan was dead last match.,8
I was today years old when I learned Lungi isn't Lungi  Ngidi's full first name,7
"So if that chunk of the bat ended up hitting the stumps, I'm guessing its still out?",8
"Curran: gloves a 110 kmph ball

Crowd: ooOoOOoOo",12
What shitty equipment does CSK own,-1
Just go for the Kill MI,3
"Ngl, it was impressive af how Curran dodged the stumps",9
Kedhar Jadhav will be LoLing in the dressing room today by thanking his luck for being dropped.,15
"CSK  Thakur - Sholay Thakur\*

insert Spiderman pointing meme",2
2020 is my IPL version of 2003 :P,10
"This is a throwback to the England tour, get top order in out cheaply but can't get Curran out",8
"There are 2 possible explanations for why he slipped in an over:
1. Pollard trying to improve his economy
2. Pollard is a major fucking narcissist",11
"Dhoni fans: *kya captain hai*

rest of r/cricket: **** ka captain hai...",14
"Now there's no chance CSK will go all out at 69

...... Hopefully",4
"Meanwhile, Thala was right.  
No spark from CSK's youngsters today.

Thala can never be wrong. /s",8
Lord Thakur has been around before Lord Tewatia. Watch out for his hitting in the last 6 overs to take the score to 130+,3
"The problem is no matter how well Curran plays this season, They won't retain   him.",2
If NCN doesn't take wickets this match Pattinson will come back,1
tag yourselves I’m the bat,4
"Swann has absolutely 0 knowledge about the Indian cricketers, especially the domestic ones. he has near 0 knowledge about the IPL and as far as I can tell he hasn't done any hard work or research and his whole schtick is acting obnoxious all the time. Total ass in my opinion.",6
At least around 120 to get a chance or else it's over.,1
"After being a fan of CSK this season, I'll never make fun of Ferrari fans in F1 ever again. I finally understand pain",2
"Times like these definitely make u question IPL. 

Have they been advised to prolong the game for Ad revenue?",6
How is anyone expecting to beat England in any limited overs tournament right now? They have just too much fire.,9
This fucking reminds me of the 2013 finals. Except we had a competent team at the time.,7
Holy fuck they ran fast,3
Sam Curran is like odd man out in CSK team.,7
I cant believe they let them take 2 on that shot,1
This Coulter Nile spell has to be the most boring economical spell of all time.,12
Tactical drop to ensure everyone gets some bowling practice,2
Finally a wicket,3
Just get a single Thakurji.,4
"Ishan Kishan looks like any moment he'll start singing *deewana dil deewana, kabse kare hai tera intezar*...",8
"Why dont they try Monu Kumar? I dont what he does, doesnt know if he's black or white....but I like his name.....",6
"2021 is gonna be dank, considering Sam will play 10 tests against us.",11
Tomorrow two matches are so juicy,11
Curran 70(40) and 5/16 to win it for csk,18
Lord thakur cannot bat against Mumbai,3
Gone,1
Did boult took a hattrick? Sorry but i didn't watch the match untill now.,1
Please break 100 atleast....,4
Thank fuck for that wicket,4
Why was Thakur trying to hit big shots? It should be Curran who does that,0
Pollard telling NCN off for taking a wicket.,5
OK how well does tahir bat?,3
Remember CSK’s lowest total was 79 and that came against MI.,11
"Murali Karthik: good stuff from MI, haven't been a lot of wickets but they haven't allowed CSK to get away...

Sometimes I wonder what these commentators think their job is all about...",53
Tried to get out thrice. Finally succeeded. Congrats!!,8
Probably should’ve just stuck with the bat with a big chunk snapped off..,9
"**14.5** Coulter-Nile to Thakur, OUT,  **71-8**

SN Thakur c Yadav b Coulter-Nile 11 (20b 0x4 0x6) SR: 55.00",2
79 all out is still on card,1
Why is Johnny Sins in MI dugout? Chris Lynn evolving into Johnny Sins.,6
lol Swann,4
Pollard cutting CSK some slack makes me think he is a decent guy with good heart.,4
"Thakur was determined to get out, he cba with this shit",7
lol now they are getting out. You either get all out for less than 49 or make 90-9 in 20 overs fools.,4
CSK giving out wickets to every bowler. CSK = Soviet Russia confirmed.,12
"Who coined Loveday Lasoon , give him Sahitya academy award at least...",3
uh swanny you okay there mate?,11
Everytime i think i cant love Swann more he proves me wrong,9
Need to take it deep and try to get 150,3
Thought I'd tune in an hour later to karmawhore on this thread but I fucked up massively,1
"Swanny’s breakdancing, what is the Dugout even",6
"Chennai have been bowled out below 100 just once in the IPL history. It was 79 all out vs MI in 2013

Can we see the second instance today?",10
I mean Dhoni wasn't wrong about the youngsters not having a spark. They both scored nil lol.,1
Lara can't deal with Swann's bs anymore,4
Anyone know a hot sauce brand that's more painful than watching this match? Feeling hungry rn,3
Sam was the imposter guys,3
Lmao tf is Swanny doing,12
Who do you feel more for? Archer for RR or Curran for CSK?,6
"I mean seriously guys, Reposting the same comments for upvotes is no fun!",9
Tahir should celebrate a four like he celebrates a wicket,12
Swann is more entertaining than CSK team.,7
"CSK- Tahir are you sulking outside for not able to bowl, come you can even bat now!",16
"I'll say it.  
The CSK captaincy is Sam's next year or year after next if he wants it.  
He's young. He's a fighter. He's an allrounder so he will find a place in the XI even if one skill isnt working.  
  
The job has its perks. If he wants it, that is",16
"If you fart while batting and bails fall down , is that hit wicket ?",11
[removed],10
50(17) incoming,7
Swanny more entertaining than the entire CSK side.,16
Australian Johnny sins is in the dugout but still Mi is fucking csk,27
Of course they are saving Bumrah for Tahir,19
Bumrah now. Please.,3
"On their way back from UAE, if the aircraft breaks, Curran would probably carry it.",18
"CSK management to Tahir : You're finally gonna play today

Tahir : Yes, I cant wait to bowl and take wickets

CSK management : You're gonna have to bat too

is Rohit injured or just got benched?,1
"At this stage, even I want to bat for csk for practice.",7
Tahir 30 (10) inc,4
"How old were you when IPL start?

I was 10 when IPL start

I was young and innocent

Now I am just young, and hopeless

And then be bang average at everything is

What is life if not a series of disappointments

Now the overseas players are the one that's keeping this team afloat!",4
God that cable management for the stand tv's are awful,1
RIP csk,1
CSK Unkills welcoming Tahir with both bat n ball.,3
And then there were two.,2
Curran you should have taken the single and keep the strike in situations like this. Rookie mistake bhai.,0
I cant belive they actually saved Bumrah for Tahir,5
[just logged in....](https://ibb.co/4gt830s),4
[deleted],3
Looks like Curran has to bat and bowl well.....he deserves a better team,6
Have CSK fans come to accept this isn’t 2010 yet or they need more games?,13
QDK hates bumrah,12
"Imran Tahir waiting this whole IPL for a chance to Bowl

csk: bat now",22
Imran Tahir's greatest achievement with the bat was pretending to be injured to waste time in that test match against Sri Lanka.,7
De cock ki dushmani hai kya bumrah se 😂😂,9
"CSK playing miserably to make Sam go into depression so that he fails to perform vs India in 2021

69D Chess by Thala",25
Thanks De Kock. Very cool.,6
Sometimes I think de Kock genuinely makes a mistake just to mess up with Bumrah,53
Man Raina must be sooo happy he isn’t involved in this shit show,14
Calling a wicket alert with the tail in against Bumrah isn't cricketing genius.,18
Does bumrah have a bloody tape on his hand? Huh?!,3
Is Hazelwood so poor with the bat that Tahir goes ahead of him in batting line up?,7
QdK helping his fellow countryman Rabada,3
"They saved Bumrah for the threat of Tahir. 

Captaincy this tournament is so weird, I won’t even try lol.",17
"CSK getting trampled all over.

Dugout: We call wicket alert.",7
"Hypothetically, if Curran takes them to 110-120, and csk win the match, would this be the biggest comeback in ipl? Definitely would be one of the best comebacks I suppose.",4
I feel for Imran. Been benched until now and has to perform miracles. No pressure.,5
Still amazes me how Bumrah generates that pace with such a gentle jog. Its almost as long as Kumble's runup.,10
"Tahir - ""finally I get included. I have to score myself to get a chance to bowl. Fml""",21
"Whatever the match situation, de Kock has one misfield off Bumrah.",11
"CSK scores the lowest score of IPL 2020

KKR : scores 84

CSK : 72/8",8
I wanted csk to win this one. Looks like RCB need to fight for top 2,5

I haven’t played in 2 years but I still feel I can bat better than the players who come at 10 and 11,6
"27(29) drop this curran guy already, no spark!",6
Whoever take Tahir out should do a lap of ground. For the memes.,9
Raina and harbajan saw this coming,9
Why do cricketers wear that cloth on their arm?,2

Bumer wanted Tahir on strike so much 😁,6
"I think its kind of a romance. Between Bumrah and Quinton. He misses, Bumrah says ok and then Quinton says thanks with unrelenting sexual tension in his eyes.",18
Somehow CSK imploding is also boring,4

That time of the match when a wicket is welcome by both teams...,7
"Release Watson and Santner and buy Malan and Kylie Jamieson also release no use Jadhav, Vijay and Chawla and buy some young domestic guys. This CSK team will look much better 👌",10
Ffs give Tahir strike. He ain't Thala,4
Lol Sam Curran playing out Bumrah to prove the dugout gurus wrong?,5
QDK protecting Bumrah from Tahir's onslaught.,8
If Quinny has actually hurt his finger.. this win means fuck all.,3
A team named 'India'ns still can't get Sam Curran out.,5
Tahir ahead of Hazelwood is like sending Chris Martin ahead of Bradman. Dhoni will answer for this!!!,7
Tahir running faster than half of csk lineup,5
"I have supported Delhi since the beginning of the IPL. As a result, I know very well what a shit team is. It did not take me too many games to see that CSK was proper shit lol.",7
"Just checked the score , so glad I decided to watch Scam 1992 today",5
In 2020 CSK has transcended reality and entered the sureal realm of RCB,4
Honestly quite a mature inning by Curran so far.,10
Just defend Tahir.,1

Oh no,1
Lmaoooo sanjay bangar,3

Who would have thought that having only two overseas batsmen in the entire squad will not be good enough?,3
"Surely the *experienced guys* will save the match. When that does not happen, Curran was given a chance by the experienced guys, speaks volume about their experience",9

Chutti kuzanthai for next CSK captain,3
TAHIR!,4
Rebuilding the CSK squad will be a long time effort stretching to 2022 at minimum. There's hardly 4 retainable players with long term prospects for the squad. If we make the playoffs in next two seasons that should be an achievement in itself.,4
CSK badly needed good Indian batsmen. Without Raina it's very difficult,5
"Wait, so Csk will actually play 20 overs?",6
"They forgot 1 criteria for emerging player - 


must have spark...",10

That's safe,1
Not out,1
next match against RR for MI . should be real interesting as RR have nothing to lose,2
Nice guy tahir,3
Throw some no balls,3
Tahir what a nice guy keeping the bails back,2
"I don't understand why everybody is shitting on CSK


Lord Thakur is going to win this for CSK with figures of 4-0-4-8.",7

Tahir with more batting sense than some CSK players.,6
Kedhar Jadhav in the dressing room with plate full of snacks going near Dhoni to feed him with a smile,8

"Sad for Tahir man, so few years left + fkin Purple cap holder of last season but still not played a match...in this season",9
what's this? CSK might actually make it to 20 overs?,5
Will SRH ever release Williamson? CSK can bulid their next 5 years around him.,10
Did Krunal just bowl a short ball,6
I find it hilarious that a lot of people are pissed off at CSK's conservative strategy. They feel vindicated somehow after all these years of CSK making to playoff.,5

Highest IPL score for Tahir now 7*..Previous was 5.. uWu!!!!,5
Tahir is da man,6
That was a clear behenchod,6
Nobody can convince me now that MI actually wants to bowl them out,11

I heard Sharjah kinda sucks as a city. true?,2
When Krunal gets old he'll look like Ajay Devgn,54
"Nobody. Nobody
K. Pandya - benchod",12
If csk can scramble 120 somehow,9
"CSK captaincy candidates  
Raina (just give him the balcony!) pros : continuity. Con : wasn't amazing when he captained GL  
  
Faf  pros : decent captain/experienced. Con : wrong side of 30. Stop gap option  
  
Curran pros : clean break from the past. Could be the bedrock for the future. All rounder.  Con : English so tours might conflict with IPL. Inexperienced.",16
[deleted],8
Pollard letting CSK bat so we could sneak in more Jio Dhan Dhana dhan ads,57
Why are MI fielders panicking and being so...upset?,13
"Why is MI acting like this is the super over of the finals !!! 


Even our Lord Tewatia was gracious enough to bowl a wide to help CSK with a run",28
did krunal just say bhenchod,7
GOAT cameraman caught Krunal’s BC,9
So Tahir replaced Watto as a batsman?,10
Even at its lowest MI can't finish CSK off. If it was anyone else they would've taken the pounding by now.,6
Still better than KKR,4
Curran finally has a worthy batting partner.,3
Yes MI go ahead and fuck it up 😔,2
Ignore this comment. I am pretending to text someone.,7
"People to fire after this IPL:

1. CSK management

2. Glenn Maxwell

3. Cameramen at sharjah",6
NCN and his chest hair back into the attack,1
I can't believe this is gonna drag out all 20 overs. I've never seen such bullshit. Get Boult and Bumrah.,2
"Mission 49 ✅

Mission 79 ✅

Mission 84 ✅",8
I hope we play Pattinson in the playoffs. NCN hasn't impressed enough.,3
Pollard has a tyre full of money waiting for him at his hotel room,6
Curran seriously should stop tail wagging again my ptsd is returning,1
"Can't blame CSK, they can't whistle with mask on.",4
I guess Pollard just wanted everyone to get their chance and experience today as MI's NRR is the highest already anyways,5
Crossed KKR. I'll stop watching now.,5
"Gotta love the CSK management guys, still waving the flags after this shit.",9
"Do the aussies, kiwis, indians etc have their own version of Curran? He is deadly!",6
CSK can still make it to playoffs. And I say this as an MI fan.,1
"Krunal is one of the most unlikeable cricketers India has produced, and Rahul Tewatia reminds me a lot of him",4
NCN wearing Sachin wig which was readily available in the 90s,4
"So CSK will retain Sam, Jadeja ,and Deepak chahar?",7
Curran farming the strike from the guy with the higher sr smh,9
This innings is going on for too long. smh.,5
KKR in the mud,0
"Imran Tahir to open


The batting 😂",7
Curran’s playing a “somebody save me from this team” innings here,8
"Sam ""Singlehandly saving CSK"" Curran",7
Ahahahaha! Pretty Boi is just toying with the bowlers now!!!,3
"IPL 2020 Below Average Looking XI Edition:

David Warner

Johnny Bairstow

Ambati Rayudu

Steve Smith

Ben Stokes

Krunal Pandya

Axar Patel

Jaydev Unadkat

Jaspreet Bumrah

Murugan Ashwin

Can't think of one now.",-5
Allowing them to get 100 after 32/6 is criminal,11
Pollard should never captain a game ever again. Absolute wasteman,4
krunal mad at fielders coz he bowled a shit ball?,8
Goddamnit bring bumrah and boult and finish this,3
"Just hit me Rohit is the only  captain with least contirbution and still he's team gonna play Play off. Really hope he stays fit for Aus tour and doesn't opt out for Test Series in Aus. Last time he became father and opt out, thrashed Rabada and Nortje in india then again got injurjed in NZ. I see a pattern 😭😂😭😂",1
Pollard captaincy sus,4
Man whatever I've seen of NCN so far he's come across such an average bowler. Certainly not bad but not as lethal as I thought he was gonna be.,10
Is Sam Curran eligible for emerging player award. I just want him to win it,7
[deleted],7
Tahir runs pretty well for his age,3
Tahir running really well for a 40 year old! Good job,3
"Match:- CSK VS MI
LOSERS:- RCB AND KKR",10
Imran Tahir runs faster than rayudu,6
QUICK DOUBLE.,2
Sam Curran deserves a better team. He would fit perfectly at RCB's lower middle order replacing someone like Udana. How much was he sold for?,4
Wonder what was the reason for the Pattinson - Coulter-Nile swap. NCN doesn't inspire any confidence with his 130-135 kph half volleys,5
"Dhoni looking for spark in youngsters...

Spark to saala Tahir apni gaand me lekar baitha tha...",5
"dear KKR, please report to special batting tuition classes from CSK",2
"Dhoni ka, Rayudu ka, Faf ka, sabka badla lega re yeh tera Curran.",3
"Where's that dude who was upset about the Mumbai team named ""Indians"". Which other team can so well replicate Indian team's tendency to leak runs to the tail?",15
MI not going for the kill. Boult should have been brought in 3-4 overs ago.,6
Did we pass kkr already?,2
MI had never seen such bullshit before,5
Who should be paid 2 million next year & made CSK's captain and why it can't be anyone other than Sam Curran?,8
"Curran is captain of Pollard's Dream11 team today, so no intent to bowl out",6
Unpopular opinion: Curran over stokes in t20 World Cup side for England,2
"Okay this is the second time MI are letting a team get away after a collapse has happened. First KKR, now CSK",5
Tahir runs faster than Watson and rayadu despite being older,10
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BOWLERS DOING WELL?  I was following the IPL and suddenly a cricket match broke out!,2
"If it isn't for MI's obligatory opening match lose, CSK would win only two matches.",9
Love Sam Curran's temperament and fight. Top guy. He really cares about the shirt.,12
"Bruh with a regular tuk tuk Dhoni accompanying Sam, CSK could have reached a decent 140 or so",12
Tahir at his age showing a lot more intent with running between the wickets than Biryani Rayudu does.,12
"Lesson for this season: They never shd have opened with Gaikwad, and should have kept the Watson Du Plessis partnership.",3
Sam Curran was sent up top to exploit a favourable matchup and was kept there for a bit too long. It was the right decision to drop him back down,2
"Phew at least our batting isn't 4-maidens-84/8 poor

Curran and our pace bowling has been our silver lining this season, hopefully when the 35+ guys retire we can build around them and Jaddu",4
"Imran Tahir @40+ is fitter than watson & rayudu, look at the guy running 2's.",8
Good balls those two now,1
"Tahir is going to bowl out MI for 48. you heard it here first. RCB, you can have your cake and eat it too",9
Pretty sure pollard has forgotten boult exists,7
Inb4 sammy boi takes 5-12(4),6
This Sam Curran guy proved that he don't have any sense of meme by playing sensible cricket. He should be ashamed.,11
I just realized Sam Curran is basically the modern day Irfan Pathan.,9
Veeeeeery long shot but imagine Mumbai losing this 👀,14
Plizz single now.,1
Tahir taking inspiration from Jordan lol,3
Why boult and bumrah for 19th and 20th??? Why the fuck not earlier,11
"Weird how attitude issues of Pandya are now of Krunal and not Hardik, marriage changes people",14
Unpopular opinion: unpopular opinion are mostly popular.,7
What is this pathetic shit from.mumbai,5
Didn't that touch him?,2
91 nice,2
Does Sam curran count as a spark-less youngester Or a enlightened experienced player?,11
De Kock's fingers must be so damaged.,6
Man would really take a 125-5 at this point,5
Get to 120 and CSK have the bowlers to defend imo.,4
[deleted],19
DeKock isn't a very good keeper,-1
Quinny thanks for the byes 💛,6
reach 100 please😢😢😢,1
Yeah.. de kock’s pretty shit behind the stumps,10
"Watch ""Kadai Kutty Singham"" aka Simba (Sam Curran) take reins from ""Mufasa"" (Dhoni)",5
Curran is an amazing player but i never thought he'd become the marquee player at 22,14
I hate you sam curran you beautiful talented bastard,4
I can’t work out if India are going to ban Sam Curran from ever visiting again or whether they’re going to give him the Bharat Ratna.,2
The only positive for CSK in this season has been Sam Curran,9
Tahir should be considered one among the ambassadors of cricket. What a guy! Plays the game with such great intensity... Surely he must have no haters,11
mumbai dragged this out unnecessarily. coud have finished this bumrah and boult way earlier.,21
"At this point... I hope Sam gets a fifty and gets CSK to 100. I feel MI really messed this up, CSK had no right to get to 88-8 after they were 32-6. Good job Sam!",27
Brain dead Captaincy fuck off,7
Why is MI suddenly misfielding?,10
12 Extras!?? Are you kidding me??,5
"""Weekends are big days""

Me who treats every day like Saturday: well yes but really no",7
"CSK: 88/8

*China prepares to board Taiwan*",3
Finally some semblance of a Sharjah game,5
I can't believe this is the same team from 1 hour back,12
NCN sus,1
Im glad we didn't retain this guy,8
3 wides holy shit,1
This is a very important inning for Curran imo. He always went for shots. Now he is at least learning how to stabilise the innings.,8
Thanks NCN. Very cool.,7
Nathan Coulter Shit. Wtf man finish this over.,5
Patinson was much better. Also Mclenaghan is siting there waiting.,5
Coulter-Nile forever bulking. Pollard inspiration,6
I hope pandya gets fit to bowl soon,2
Nice chest Nathan!,8
Fuck this shit,2
WTF is lunder Nine doing. BC such a pathetic bowler.,1
"Sunny G blaming CSK for sending out Gaikwad against Bowlers like Boult and Bumrah is validated! But Gaikwad looked like a tailender in the middle order! If they want Spark, keep him at the top! Not every team has MI's opening attack!",3
De Kock is clearly hurt. Get Kishan to keep the last 2 overs,6
reach 130-140 and we can still win,2
Lenskart marketing is so smart to put funny cricket moments in their ads and dumb enough to send fake money credit messages.,4
"Maybe it's the pessimistic 90's kid in me talking, but is there a match on here now that 100 runs look on on board?",11
I'm happy they breached 84,3
Sam Curran is the human personification of angry upvote.,7
"Curran is future for csk, he should be the main priority to be retained, they are definitely gonna retain dhoni. Who else will they retain?",8
still this won't be the lowest total of csk against MI,7
Good comeback from 43/7 honestly,10
Next stop. 100.,2
If it was Gautam Gambhir he would have bowled Bumrah Boult in trot for their full quota,7
"NCN is the better all round player, but from what I've seen so far.. I slightly prefer Pattinson over him.",4
Rohit making sure no one sees him breaking into the vada pav vault,19
Whys Pattinson not playing?,2
Less than 100 pls,1
NCN - the only bowler with a 6+ economy.,5
Poor Curran,2
Imagine letting them get 100 after that start,4
This innings really shouldn't have gone this long. Linda want CSK to put up a scare for this complacent game process from MI.,2
Curran has legitimate potential for English captain in the future.,9
0 4 2 0 0 Wd3 Wd 1,1
Sam carried us! what a madlad! build a statue for him already!,10
Mark Nicholas sounds like he just makes shit up when he talks because he assumes no one watching will know any better. Man has never heard of r/cricket we know better than everyone,3
"If he somehow ends up winning it, Tewatia will surely be the worst MVP in IPL history?",4
century is in the vicinity fellas 😈,2
should've kept curran with kxip,3
Innings of great character by Curran. Screw the s/r but he's shown a lot of responsibility unlike a certain someone who eats balls when they should be hitting and tries to go bang when they should be stabilizing,7
NCN should not be considered as an overseas player. A guy with 3 button down look and chest hair is a proper Mumbaikar,5
This tournament we have seen the batting team make the game interesting in the second innings. This may be the first instance of the bowling team making it interesting.,3
Chris Lynn's having a nice holiday.,6
"QdK hasn't collected any of these slower balls cleanly. His fingers must be in quite a bit of pain tbh, keeps getting the ball on the end of them",4
CSK losing against everybody 🤝 MI losing against meme teams,13
MI making sponsors happy,4
calling it 2nd ball is going to be free hit,0
Unrelated but I have lost my motivation in everything what do I do 😔,2
Can Mitch Mc play above NCN? Can bat a bit too,2
This has been absurd captaincy by Pollard tbh. He should have gone in for the kill when they were 43-7 and got either of Boult/Bumrah back.,3
"   
Ipl is the team where 7 teams fight to play csk in the finals",6
Can pretty Boi Shyam  Karan get his 50?!,2
Honestly this isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. I thought we'd score lower than RCB. Thank you Sam Curran!,6
NCN needs to go ASAP. Rohit needs to come back ASAP,1
Don't field like that. Let the get some runs,0
Lol Bumrah why not ball the same at the stumps he was a gonner,2
What a shot that was,2
Chris Lynn enjoying the buffet,3
Krunal justifying his BHENCHOD,9
CSK's NRR is going to be really fucked after this game.,3
[deleted],4
That shot deserved a boundary. Sam Curran is a brilliant batsman.,5
CSK and KKR's innings serves to show us how impressive rcb's 49 all out actually was.,13
"Really laud MI's think tank.

With Lynn sitting out the entire tournament, any other franchise would have thought to play him if someone like Rohit got injured. This would have forced another change with maybe Coulter Nile sitting out for a domestic bowler.",1
Imagine letting go of someone who's as young and dynamic as Sam curran . KXIP lmao,13
"Nathan Coulter is *guy* your crush tells you not to worry about.

Taller than you ✓

Looks way better ✓

Big dick ✓

Charming ✓

Sense of humour ✓

Pollard trying the INFLATE DEFLATE straaatargy,2
"Curran reminds me of Kapil Dev (bear with me on this one).  His bowling doesn’t look threatening and his batting looks loose. However, he’s constantly in the game and makes me feel like I clearly don’t understand cricket as I think he’s useless and he constantly proves me wrong.",10
Pollard has been a bit defensive considering the situation his team was in. Defensive mindset.,16
Give curran his half century,7
Uh oh.,3
Tahir is the real MVP,5
Faf got out twice according to Nicholas. Cretin,4
"Mark Nicholas got about 2 of the first 4 wickets wrong there

Time and time again he makes basic errors like this",7
Tahir tahir,2
Nicholas getting the batsmen wrong during that montage...,7
So 100 up,6
FFS Mumbai,2
100!!!,4
Tahir the next Tewatia,6
Imran Tahir MVP 2020,10
Tahir 😍😍😍😍,9
Tahir wtf lol,3
Imran Tendulkar.,11
Gotta love Tahir man.,6
Tahir is one of the most entertaining cricketer,5
I'm gonna wear my tinfoil hat and say they were asked to prolong the match a bit more.,4

did mid season transfer happen?,2
Wtf commentary is this. Calling Gaikwad duplesis and jaggi Gaikwad. Lol,8
Dude fuck yeah Tahir!!!,6
fucking sparkling batting from tahir,4
Tahir is really surprising me here haha,6
"NCN went for 6.25 an over, y'all going on like he went for 11 an over",5
Tahir and Curran are literally the one players with soul. If csk somehow wins we need an appreciation thread for these two,1
"Imran ""legitimate T20 batsman"" Tahir",5
"Tahir once again : Know your place, Trash!",4
Tahir for India #4,9
Just york him boomz he old.,-1
Imran *shane watson* Tahir,5
All CSK players next season to replace their cocks with [this!](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D7FC6LYHL._AC_SL1500_.jpg),1
I love tahir with all my heart,5
"Good cricket all round, inswinging yorker, good shot from Curran to get it to deep point and good fielding from Krunal to save a boundary.",3
No one from csk but tahir ( ˘ ³˘)♥,6
"Jasprit ""destroy top batsman and get destroyed ny tailenders"" bumrah",19
Bumrah and getting his figured ruined by tailenders. The most infuriating thing ever.,9
Tahir <3,7
Fuck yeah Imi. Show them what you got.,3
Looks like CSK found their Openers.,7
Tahir got spark bruh,10
Tahir showing how it's done.,6
Another Tahir beaut...,5
What a shit lmao,3
meme teams in mud,3
So much shitty captiancy this year.,6
Moral victory,2
Bumrah always looks like such a simple guy. He must have a good heart (no homo),8
How tf did Tahir keep that out?!,3
We made past 100.Moral victory™,5
There's the ton. Amazing knock,3
Tahir unironically the 2nd best batsman in csks innings is great to see,7
That's the ball u need. Why would u go short against the tail?,2
💯,3
They benched their best batsman Tahir for 10 matches,5
Imran > Curran,1
Ngl 20 more runs and this is an average csk total this season,7
I hope we don't go the RR way and have us by the balls. Someone can be our Steve Smith for sure,2
Why leave Bumrah till 19th over?,2
[deleted],2
Why did we let Curran go :(,1
Hahahahaha,0
Is there some rule that you can't get the opposition all out?,8
Tahir: Deus Vult!!,2
I knew it. We should have opened with Tahir.,3
"Yes chennai! Win this fucking game you fucks, we need the top of table",4
Tahir has played a better innings than Kedar Jadhav this season 😂😂😂,8
Reduce them to 6 wickets early- Yea sure                                      Clean the tail- Well now we won't do it,12
Tahir and curran to open,10
"Did Tahir just hit a boundary off Bumrah? Truly in a weird timeline, we are.....",9
I think Tahir is getting under Bumrah's skin lol,10
Tahir the youngster showing Thala the spark he wanted,18
Why take the single????,2
"Holy shit, we reached 100",2
Curran playing the kind of innings Dhoni fans would praise and his haters would shit on!,12
MI so bored one of the player's just signalled something and didn't even react to the Ball rushing past,6
nicholls called gaikward faf multiple times today,12
100 crossed 🙏,3
Tahir is going to upgrade his job title to bowling all-rounder,12
In before Tahir does a Tewatia,4
Why is MI playing NCN over Pattinson?,8
"CSK




That's it. That's the joke",0
Remember the time when the score that was double of this was considered criminal?,4
"Good bowling performance and all, but really should have kept them under 70.",2
20 run over?,3
Why did you take the single Sam :o,2
OK! Its settled now - SIRAJ >>>>>>>> BUMRAH.,2
Tahir has more spark than anyone in this team!,8
Tahir has unironically been one of their best batsmen.,3
Just remebered a match MI vs SRH. Where SRH scored 100 odd in the first innings then bowled out MI for 80 odd.,8
Scenes if mumbai don't chase this,9
Hahaha Tahir is amazing,3
Curran deserves a 50 at least for this,9
Tahir retaining strike and protecting the tailender here.,2
Boult's got the capability to give about 10-15 runs at the end here. Let's see.,5
Why are they so rigid with their plans? They could've easily bowled them out. There would've been no need to save them for death overs.,2
Instagram reels : bcoz tiktok wasn't cringey enough already,9
100 up. Not many thought they would see that at 3-4,4
Chonker Tiwari.,18
I hope MI not playing for the kill doesn’t come back to haunt them,6
Holy shit Tiwari you cute fat fuck,12
is this the last season for watson and dhoni?,1
Tiwary fielding 1000,7
Damn Tiwary is buff,6
Oh lawd he comin,6
I was wondering where they hid Tiwary!,8
Stop the ball. Kick the ball. BE a ball /s,5
Tiwari so fat and slow,6
Who is the thiccboy?,8
MI gonna chase this in 10.,2
lol who is this really fat dude,6
"Csk: Maro hum ko,Maro. Hum koi mandir kar ghanta hai ki jo bhi aata hai maar ke jaata hai!",3
"Damn this match sure has given us everything unseen


No Tuk Tuk when actually needed by Dhoni


Sam single handedly carrying the team 


Tahir hitting Bumrah for a 4 


And yet nothing would ever prepare you for this : Rayudu running a 2 !!!!",16
Wicket alert,1
What a save by Gendaswaaamy,10
That is so dangerous,6
Big Tank Stopper,4
West Indian fielding,7
is kicking the ball allowed?,0
Vadapao lite,9
Damn he's a big unit,8
Saurab is thicckkkkk,2
Yeahhhh thiccwary,2
LMFAO @ Saurabh Tiwary fielding with his boot,3
"Please chase this, else we won't hear the end of it",2
"Even on their bad day, CSK scoring twice as many runs as RCB's 49!",6
Curran wasn't even born when Tahir made his debut.,6
Saurabh tiwary gained weight. A lot.,4
"they are tuck-tucking to 120, unacceptable.",4
Tiwari has grown bigger compared to the last time he played in this IPL!!,9
Abe tiwari bend ho jaa chutiye 🤣,9
 Its bcz of this sub that I everytime read the word **benched** as **bhenchod** lol,4
Salute for CSK lower order. you absolute madlads.,6
Someone ate Saurabh Tiwary,3
Krunal tried a Tiwary and failed,5
"Broke: Diving to save a boundary

Woke: Stopping a boundary with your shoe",7
"I really hope Curran gets 50

Edit : My boy did it!!",3
"Jadeja who , Saurabh Tiwary is the best fielder /s",7
Looks like Saurabh Tiwary found the weight that one of the Ambani's lost.,3
holy Tiwary is as big as Two Rohit Sharmas,7
Pre 2020 Rohit body double?,4
Boult gives up 2 digits runs. didn't think it will happen today.,4
Have you ever seen more elegant Rhyno than that?,3
Fucking hell i would give CSK 25% chance now,4
"Tiwary looks seriously, seriously unfit",8
tiwari with the badshah bod,6
Siraj remains elite with 3-8.,7
Giving Boult the last over is a shitty idea. Should have bowled when he was in great touch.,3
Excellent stuff from Curran,1
If Bumrah and Boult were brought back in at 43/7 things could've ended earlier with the momentum but they played safe just in case Curran started striking against others to have them ready later,3
Curran can be added to the list of English players who deserve a better team,8
lets go curran get to 50,6
"the way dhoni and some of his stooges were dismissed,  it's clear who told them to play attacking shots. curran took the calculated risk and has at least given *something* to the bowlers to defend",2
I don't understand MI's tactic did they want runs on the board so they can have some match practice?,3
Saurabh Tiwary looks like he ate his younger version,6
Strategic time out. The only 2 min 30 seconds when CSK didn’t lose a wicket,2
Chungus tiwary,8
Imran Tahir shoewing more spark with the bat than Jadhav did all season.,3
Saurabh Tiwari is the right replacement for Vada Pav.,9
Lessgo. 120 plizz.,1
This is so frustrating to watch.,3
"No guys, give them the runs, why stop them lol.",1
"I really wanna hate on MI, but gotta say they have the ability to unearth raw talents and package them into international successes. Who the fuck is their talent scout?",10
"no one but Sam, Tahir and Thakur <3",4
"Sam Curran has a long, prosperous career ahead of him.",9
Marathi petition to rername CSK to Cheee SK,6
sam’s gonna need a chiropractor after carrying today,10
"We've really fucked it and given them a chance, this is such bullshit",4
"You let the tail wag too long you shitz, want MI to lose this to teach them a lesson.",6
out of the loop why is rohit not playing today?,3
"This can be a competitive score ngl, csk will have the momentum and with Tahir back anything can happen",8
Rohit Replacement looks like his Mega Evolution lmao,18
IPL should have helped india win multiple T20 WC it hasn't happened but surely players like Rohit and Gambhir takes IPL too seriously and didn't work on their Test career. But IPL certainly has made BCCI boss of world cricket.,5
"We should win this easily but Pollard let them in, now they have very very minor chance of defending it like SRH defended 110 odd in 2018 vs us, Pollard should have gone for the kill",7
Curran is one of the best things to have ever happened to this team,7
Did Saurabh Tiwary replace Rohit or did he eat him?,14
"Bro Tahir please don't injure yourself, please.",6
"Sam Curran you absolute mad-lad, what an amazing performance has this been from him.",11
CSK have given themselves a chance here. It's highly unlikely but a score around 110 is still a job to be done for MI.,4
They replaced Rohit sharma of 2020 with Rohit sharma of 2022.,8
Sammy 50 plz,2
Curran: fucking with indians since 2018,9
Come on curran!,2
Remember when Mark Nicholas mistook some dwarfs playing cricket for toddlers?,7
Imran is great fun to watch.,4
So who choked MI or Csk?,7
Sammy 50 plz,3
Lol why is Tahir always walking around in the middle of the pitch,4
MI giving some free runs to CSK. Will this come back and haunt them?,3
Tahir is so fun to watch.,4
Curran was deliberately made to bat at 7. Mahsterstroke by Mahi^^TM,3
Saurabh “badshah” Tiwary,6
Wait what? Is that saurabh tiwaari? The last time I remember seeing him was in the IPL 2010 with his long hair playing for RCB,5
"if Boult didnt waste his time trying to appeal that, he could've gotten the run out",0
Tahir running back faster than uthappa,7
Just a question - Is it still a humiliation for Thala and CSK?,3
I hope they retain curran next year.,7
Even RCB managed to restrict KKR to less than 100. This kinda shit ain't expected of the Ambanis,18
Tahir’s commitement is insane. Sprinting back to avoid being runout and he’s 41. And he’s showing intent with the bat.Respect,18
Srh vs Mi flashbacks 2018,13
Sam Curran is one spark in this team,12
Sam Curran is very familiar with the actual batsmen in his team shitting the bed and having to shithouse his team to a somewhat defendable score,11
Imran Tahir has more intent than majority of the rest of the CSK team combined,7
What’s the context behind curran and messing with India references?,2
*csk opens with tailenders next game*,7
Yeah what was the point in saving Boult?,2

Unlucky lad. You're one of the only two in this team that are worth any money at all.,9
Well played Samuel Curran,8
Sam Curran. Remember the name.,11
Curran is so red! Can't believe he has to bowl 4  overs now!,14
3-4 to 114-9. Every team would take that after being 4 down so early. But wow what a ball from Boult. Unrooted Sam here.,27
"If there is one cricketer, whom I want to take with me for a war, it is Sam Curran. I know he will not give up till the end.",14

Not all out. MORAL VICTORY^(TM),13
Momentum with csk here  it's 60-40 in thei favour,4
"gj csk, expected a more shabby ending than this.",9
Guess MI would have wrapped up CSK under 80 runs had Rohit captained today. Pollard let them off the hook.,12
That's definitely going on r/deathrattleporn,7
Thanks Sam. Ready to bowl in 8mins? Looking for about 3 wickets early on.,8
"Why would Boult do this to Sammy's average, what a prick",6
"Gem of an innings from Curran. 

Low key frustrated we let them get to to 114 when we had CSK by the balls earlier. We actually have to go chase this now.",15
Well done Sam!,6
I miss those days winning team takes the wickets home.,1
Fuck off madarchod,-6
You lot think they can defend this?,6
Curran was probably the best purchase by CSK in auction apart from Tahir in recent times.,14
"Man you gotta love Tahir, isn't a batsman but still gives his 100%. Isn't angry about not getting games.

CSK better have him in some permanent capacity and pay him big bucks after he retires.",35
Tahir ends with highest SR,4
Well done Sam,3
According to Bangar Curran has scored more than half their total runs. Quick maffs.,16
Sam Curran is the only English player I can ever love without any guilt from my heart,11
Sam you dropped this .... 👑,15

Curran providing some spark to the score,4

Does Sam Curran remind anyone of Tom Holland?,7

" 3 runs for 4 wickets to 114, I'll take this happily.",10

Great batting sam! He is a special player and csk should retain him for sure,4

Come on csk make this interesting,3
I got the script boys. 2 quick wickets then a clean 8 wicket victory for Mumbai.,26
"Sam Curran is young, talented & a calm head on his shoulders, this has to be promising signs for the Poms.",19
We cannot have pollard captaining this side again,12
"Lets see if CSK can produce a bowling masterclass.

But then again who am I kidding.",11
Dhoni should've stuck around with Curran instead of going for the big shots. Screw that positive intent bs.,10
Sam Curran is like in my top 5 favorite players,7
Well done Trent with your best figures in the IPL!,10
Curran batted well enough. Tahir especially was very handy when he couldn’t get going in the middle,8
Why leave Bumrah and Bolt for 19 and 20 lmao,14
Sam Curran : ~~spark~~ Illuminati confirmed,7
Sam Curran proves his worth in pressure situations. Still remember his test 50 against India.,19
I understand that Curran has been good but he hasn't been exactly terrific in IPL. Why is so highly rated by these commentators?,-4
Still didn't get all out. Unbelievable,8
"King of Sparks, Sam Curran. What a guy, why the fuck is CSK not giving him a standing ovation?",15
"That innings will probably be forgotten pretty quickly given the start to the innings but it’s a superb effort from Curran.

CSK should’ve gotten no where near 100 let alone 114, he played with maturity, kept things at the very least ticking and proved he’s much more than just a pinch hitter.",14
That is how you sparkle,6
"Commentary : Sorry batting at the beginning, 0, 1.... Dhoni tried his best, but short innings from the great man.

I hate CSK but I hate Pollard's captaincy more. Please win this CSK.,8
"Well done Imran, Not out and a positive batting contribution!",6
CSK batting (other than Curran) collapsed faster than my mental health during quarantine,5
Get 2 wickets early and who knows? They already have some momentum since they shoulda been bowled out for 80 and instead have 114.,3
Yeh nah,3
"Curran Sole King! CSK!  
Anyways, Dhoni with second highest runs in CSK batting.",3
Sam current,7
The best thing for CSK this year-Sam Curran,4
"Great to see atleast one guy who is just going to retire shown spark, while all the youngsters gone for low scores",3
114 is at least a little bit defendable,4
Sexy figures,1
Genuine Q. Noticed Mumbai's sponsors. Do they actually stay at the Marriots when playing here also?,1
Pollard thought this was CPL,7
Had dhoni stuck with curran we would be way ahead,10
"Come on CSK , Win this for the memes and my boy, Curran!",3
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Curran. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Curran. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",1

Good fucking Lord, the state of this team",14
Sam Curran is pure gold,5
MI should bring Pattinson next match. NCN brings those batting advantage but ends up leaking half century on the other end.,5
"Is this the lowest score at Sharjah? Also, was low-key hoping for Curran to stay not out just because of Dream 11 😂",4
"Its always great watching cricketers grow, I've seen Boult mature from a tearaway quick to a skillful world class bowler.",4
"It’s unlikely, but if any team were to defend this, It’d be CSK tbh (or Delhi). Tahir, Hazlewood and New Ball Chahar could be lethal",9
Are you telling me that there was no one other than tiwary to replace rohit?,9

Youngsters are truly shit in CSK

Curran played well and that's what mattered to me lol",11

"Jagadeesan looked absolutely destroyed when walking back to the dressing room. 

They were not of any use today but CSK needs to play both Jagadeesan and Gaikwad for the remaining matches. Stick with them and show them the same backing shown to the international players, hopefully they'll return the trust in some way.",26
"Bruh Sam's gonna bowl 4-20 now, BDE on both teams. Win this shit single handed, get five awards, look at dhoni and go ""look at me, I'm the captain now""",22
This Sam Curran innings is definitely one of the greatest half centuries I've seen. It's amazing how he batted under this much pressure. Kudos to Curran,7

"Experience means nothing unless you can execute, else The legends and coaches would have been playing around as the star players.",13
"This is a great sign for the other teams making it to the playoffs. MI can definitely switch off, and a better team would've absolutely punished the shit out of them.",1
Part of me feels like this thrashing is what justice should look like. All dhoni hatred was because of his denial of situations. I'm sure there can be no denial here. Or can I be wrong?,13

I just woke up and all I'm gonna say is - what the fuck,11
Dhoni should step aside and give the captaincy to Sam curran.,-2
"Anyone realised that the only reason csk won in many matches last season was because of Dhoni saving their arse so many times? With him sorely out of form, no wonder csk is showing their true flavors",34

"so question: was Dhoni's ""youngsters lack spark"" comment directed at *all* of the ""youngsters"" in the team? or specifically the Indian ones (Gaikwad and Jagadeesan)?",11
There should be swing for Sam Curran so they should open the bowling with him along with Chahar.,8
At least one youngsters has shown spark today,13
in the end csk didnt even lose all wickets. that was poor intent.,9

Kishan always looks good but I feel like every ball he's one stupid shot away from getting out,12
Has the pitch changed drastically or CSK batting is pure shit? I am inclining towards later.,8
Lmao Swanny.,1
Water has more flavour than Shardul,6
MI are stupidly overpowered with QDK in this kind of form.,9
Is mumbai gonna get +5 NRR against csk here.,10
"Someone warn Dhoni

If Tahir gets a wicket, he's gonna run all the way to his hotel. Someone needs to stop him.",6
It’s hit the car!,3
He didn't even put that much effort in to that shot,1
MI would have won by now had Pollard showed better captaincy,8
Mumbai doesn't even need run rate,4
CSK should be relegated for this shit.,9
thread delete kardo bc,4
Sanjay Bangar sounds so awkward,5
Damn that  Versa narrowly dodged running over that Ball. What would've happened to the car when running over that? Would it have flipped over?,1
What is this match? Seems like MI is playing on a different pitch. Making it look so easy.,5
Bruh that was dangerous. They should put a sheild or net around that part of highway,3
"They should put some fences there, that ball could've hit the car",6
Please. Please bring in Tahir before the match is over. I am watching this match only for his bowling,10
Lol Dugout Altroz,4
I just want a QDK fifty is all,10
Sam Curran died for this,13
"Anyone else remember thakur giving a send off to Quinton and Rohit was like, bhosdike kya kar raha hai",3
It’s insane how much better QdK has been than Warner this year. 2.6 Cr. for an explosive keeper batsman is a steal.,17
"If Swann doesn't get an Altroz after IPL is over, he is getting scammed",6
"Sam Curran
Josh Hazelwood
Imran Tahir
Faf du Plessis
Ravindra Jadeja
Deepak Chahar

are the only ones CSK should be building around next year. Too bad there's a lot of time for the mega auction.",5
"Where do balls come from when they are hit outside stadium? If everytime a batsman hits it out of stadium and a new ball is issued , wouldn't that give pacers huge advantage regarding swing?",6
"They're making it look like a 220 pitch, which is probably is.",13
The dugout is so much fun,9
Man promoting that Altroz couldn’t be more fake from Sanjay at Dugout,10
MI should have talked trash before the game and said we are coming in all white (all black in western tradition) to attend the funeral of CSK.,9
"Chennai: * *farms net run rate throughout their matches* *

Mumbai: *I'm boutta end this team's whole net run rate*",18
"Atleast I can work on my SOP a bit today. 


T.T",6
"ah yes, time to *strategise*",6
My view of Dhoni has changed a bit since this seaspn's IPL began,9
Has anyone hit Altroz with a 6 yet?,6
MI just going for the crazy NRR at this point. Was nervous that the extra CSK runs would hurt us but I’m glad it didn’t happen that way,5
Sanjay Blandgar,8
Dhenier going for a quick poop session,6
Who knew Swann was this funny?,5
It's sort of funny when Swann panders to the advertisers. Bangar just sounds like a guy who's forced to do it at gunpoint.,8
Dhoni running to take a shit,3
MI making sure that fans at home can sleep early so they're finishing the match early.,9
Knew Mumbai would bat like this.This is what annoyed  me with RCB's batting the other day.Did not show urgency.,9
"Much has been said about CSK batting, but 
feels like they have zero wicket taking threats!

No bowler in their lineup feels threatening to bat against. Like a Bumrah, Rabada, Rashid, Chahal.",6
Strategic Tire timeout :p,7
Lot of similarities between De kock and Kishan in the way they play the shots. Similar style.,8
"Soooooo, does the CSK management book the return tickets tonight?",4
"I think ball collectors knew that CSK is playing today, see nobody is even out there to collect ball.",8
[Dhoni's all time favourite song. ](https://open.spotify.com/track/5CYJB5Md92kvcrZ4lJDALY?si=Wo-RR1aHQ8GOt6ZVQPUsTw),2
Swann is such a troll,7
"South African players are the most efficient this season. ABD, QDK, FAF, Rabada, Morris... all of them are valuable assets to the team. 


Aussies on the other hand.",15
MI is showing intent. Unlike the counterparts,8
"Wow this is a dream revenge for MI for that first match loss. 

Also, Sam Curran needs a better team than an old age home.",13
Dhoni going for a quick betting session,12
No stopping mumbai Indians folks. MI to dominate IPL for the 50 years till the entire city of mumabi is submerged in water due to global warming.,13
Give Sam the ball you ding dongs,8
Is it allowed to go into the dugout during this timeout?,3
Just name it pee break instead of stretegic timeout. Its not an embarrassment mans goota go when he gotta go.,3
[deleted],0
The ball after avoiding getting run over by a highway car: I am speed bitch,9
Fold the CSK. BRING BACK THE CHENNAI SUPERSTARS!,2
"In the beginning of the season, I felt that Grame Swann was being annoying but honestly now I love the playful and funny vibes he brings into the dug out.",8
Stadium DJ should play Coffin Dance on every boundary,11
Why are csk matches so boring and dull,5
Bruh CSK gonna come all guns blazing vs RCB,8
Dhoni running to parking lot to slash tyres,5
The Instagram reels ads are so superior to the Josh ads it's not even funny,5
Mumbai and Chennai outperform in a lot of games because of confidence of winning from previous seasons. It’s interesting to see how they fall apart without that confidence.,-6
Serious question : whose insurance pays if a flying 6 hits and cracks mu windshield ?,5
DC and MI are too strong. KXIP is a wild card though.,10
How many of you cringe every time you see Dhoni on the ground now? That guy is really a joke!,-6
Dhoni running to the dressing room in search for some intent,9
Reminds me of the 2012 season opener where Richard Levi smashed a quick debut fifty and Sachin got injured for 5 matches. Chased an easy 112 vs CSK,9
Almost expected that car on the right side of the road to flip over like the blue car from Mr Bean when the ball hit it,7
Anyone know where Rohit is?,0
Guys Ambani changed the pitch during the innings break. That is why MI is batting well,15
[deleted],12
"Can't believe how big was Suresh Raina's contribution to this CSK unit, without him, this team looks worse than my gully team",5
Csk still has a real chance of making it to playoffs if 4 other teams pull out of the tournament.,16
Strategic cry in the bathroom timeout.,5
Guys who can I sub into my Dream11 for Jadhav after lockout? Has to be a cheapie,1
Will this be CSK’s worst ever loss?,4
"With the amount of juvenile promotion done for Altroz, I sincerely hope someone cunts it with a pin-point six.",3
Why’s Swanny talking about kids playing Hide and Seek?,4
I want to see if Tahir will run like crazy if he gets a wicket now.,2
Scenes now if every team targets CSK to help improve their NRR,8
"Dhoni should just retire.
His captaincy has suffered too.",5
Strategic wank time,10
"Problem with CSK's Youngsters is they feel overjoyed by presence of Dhoni and this CSK brand. They should be more fearless like young S. Badrinath who used to take on Malinga, Brett Lee and legendry Dilhara Fernando like they were nothing. ❤️",4
"Who would have expected for an intense match between MI and CSK to be so one sided, and CSK being 3 - 4 in 2 overs ?",3
"Boom, also more Intent™",3
Nrr go brrrrrrrrrr,7
"Comms: Ishan averages 5.8 against Tahir

Ishan: I'm gonna do what's called a pro game move",11
"Remember when key players used to be rested vs minnows?

Unrelated: Rohit looking comfortable in that dressing room",6
Kishan flexing his Spark™,9
I love how MI is yeeting CSK out of the tournament,14
"Srini maama must be pissed off. He spoke unprofessionally about Raina before the tourney, you don't wash you dirty linen in public you corrupt fuck. Now his entire team is fucked.",22
Ok time for the other pretenders to move over . Big daddy wants his spot at the top of the table .,3
Can anybody tell me what's MI current run rate?,3
MI toying with the opposition now,11
I am just waiting for Dhoni’s post match blame game at this point: so far we have blamed the conditions changing despite winning the toss mostly and the youngsters without playing them much.,26
Get out QDK or IK. I want to see Tahir's celebration run,11
Dhoni should retire or his reputation will he further tarnished,14
Lmaooo Sam losing it,4
"Reporters: MS, why did you guys lose this match?

Dhoni: You see, we lost the coin toss. And that was game over.",25
No spark in the captaincy tonight,10
Even KXIP can't mess it up now,11
MI treating CSK like CSK are KKR.,10
What a ‘sparkling’ performance from CSK,7
Imagine batting with your might and getting 50 only to be thrashed by de kocks,4
Can't wait to see what bs Dhoni sells in the post match press conference,8
Have Dhoni bowl you cowards.,10
CSK are going to be really fucked next season if the rumours of no mega auction for the next season turn out to be true. Way too many deadweights in the team.,7
Jaddu vs 2 de kocks? Funeral time,8
"CSK opening the tournament by defeating MI.
MI just returning the favour by closing CSK's chapter.",4
"Dhoni should ""rest"" himself for the rest of the tournament  and let someone else take charge. May be Jadeja or Faf. That's the right thing to do.",2
How did kxip lose from this chutiya team,5
Swanny throwing shade down on KP,5
"The last few days , this IPL has gone to pot. Many one-sided  matches.",1
"Is the NRR in the standings an average or an accumulated total? Because right now MI is at a RR of 9.25 ..... while CSK was at 5.7.

MI is gonna have a ridiculous lead on NRR after this match, but I'm curious about the math.",0
"a youngster with ""spark"" giving it back to CSK just made my day.",4
The geriatrics at CSK prolly want to turn in over for an early night,1
MI should send pollard next to bat atleast 20 balls. Poor guy never gets to bat more than 5-10 balls,2
"Tahir is showing more intent and enthusiasm than any of the other fucks.

Other than Sam ofc",4
Odd. All the csk flairs in this thread are missing now lol,2
"“That was before KP fell out with everybody” - Swann

Well that’s candid",11
Whats the reqd RR. they need to take it deep and blast in the last 3 overs.,2
Imran Tahir is Jesus,6
Thala no.1 captain. Bowling jadeja to 2 left arm batsman in sarjah.,6
"Can’t drop further down the table if you’re already last

9D chess from Thala and CSK",7
The only disappointment is we didnt get to tonk Curren ka bachcha.,2
"Surely, Tahir is reverse age frauding. He's a fit MF.",5
Sexy shot,3
Wtf was that,3
"CSK looks like the PWI team looking clueless on the field.  Playing for the sake of it. No fight whatsoever. This is not the team we saw year and year after. 

Losing matches is fine and all, but playing like this is too disheartening.",9
"Bold prediction. Saying Kishan will hit 2 sixes this over against jadeja.

Edit: Just hit one as I was typing this. And another while I was typing this edit. Let's see if he keeps going.",23
Tomorrows match is gonna be interesting as fuck,5
Ishan Kishan is Jos Buttler today,6
"Can someone make a comparison between MI and CSK ( at this stage, CSK were x and MI are y)",2
Any teams with CSK games left can expect a free win,4
Wow this kid is such a treat to watch when he gets going.,10
"Today kishan is too chad for de kock

De kock is discount kishan",10
"Boom, so much Intent™",9
[deleted],1
Good to see De Kock encouraging his twin brother,8
Damn IK... Have some chill,6
I would get myself a CSK flair if Dhoni bowled today. Make me do it MS I dare you.,9
Ishan whipping his dick out,8
Kishan’s stat padding now,4
Kishan playing Rohit out of the team,6
*stop he's already dead*,3
Jadeja's bowling has taken a massive hit for his batting.,5
Deewana dil deewana 50 for kishan 👏👏,6
"Imagine being csk batsmen, scoring 114 in 20overs only to watch some young dude reverse sweep 1 over point for six",23
Stunning shot,7
It’s insane the gap between MI and CSK,9
"YES YES YES
DESTROY THEM!!!",12
This is now a net practice session,9
I think we've finally hit rock bottom,9
Has jadeja even been in top 10 spinners / all-rounders this season? His india spot is probably threatened right now,7
Its good they sent someone who cant defend,10
what a shot,4
"Yep, it’s the pitch.",6
Give bowling to Curran ffs,6
Just Sharjah things,7
MI are just euthanising CSK via boundaries here,8
"So who is better option for India in WT20?
Pant or Kishan ?",3
"When Kishan’s in rhythm, he’s insane",5
"Kishan knows I have college work to get back to, appreciate it bro",12
Ishan Kishan making a string case for the upcoming T20 WC,6
This IPL is filled with either super overs or  snoozefest.,1
"Jadeja's bowling is just plain awful these days in t20, hope he's nowhere near the Indian t20 side.",3
This is going to end in next 10 balls,1
Calm down kishan I know you get excited onseeing spinners,5
"Jajeda ain't that a great player.
His world cup innings were an exception.",1
Jadeja wants to go back to the hotel early,4
We want Ishan kishan in our team 🤞.,3
Why tf am I sad rn,2
"Remember when Ganguly hit 3 consecutive sixes, each bigger than previous, over mid wicket against Zimbabwe?",2
RIP jadeja,2
So this is the youngster who is showing the spark. Too bad it’s for the wrong team. Dhoni not happy.,2
"""Powerhitting Really Overrated Cos Everyone Simply Sucks"" 

Read first letter of every word.",10
"Paying 6.75 Crore for Piyush Chawla, Paying 7.8 Crore for Jadhav. Even if these were for less than a Crore or 2 it would be okay but this is serious buck which could have been used for say someone like a Alex Hales, Adam Zampa(When he was in the auction), going hard for Chris Lynn.",3
"Ishan ""I haven't defended my all life"" Kisan",6
I am going to upload this match to pornhub. suggest me good title.,3
Disgraceful for even Ambani to change the pitch mid-match,2
Funny how QdK is simply rotating the strike.,5
Ishan Kishan and budget Ishan kishan??,8
"CSK: No you can't just hit sixes, this is not a pitch for that what are you doing ? 

&#x200B;

MI: The ball goes brrrrr",11
CSK top order made this pitch look like a minefield lol,6
CSK Batsmen must be feeling alot better because their bowling unit fucking this up even better.,3
Bangar is so cute,3
"I would be so happy, if MI wins by 9 wickets instead of 10.",0
Ishan Kishan is having the time of his life. Love that MI management has given him the license to play his natural game.,5
Someone tell mumbai they are playing 20 overs and not 10.,4
"CSK sadness thread.
Coming in 3.....2....1....",1
Pollard let CSK make 100+ total so that he can get to bat some. QDK and Kishan ruining his plans,7
"MI's losses this year:

- Token opening match loss as usual, but still close. Lost in last over with 4 balls left.

- Lost in Super Over to RCB

- Lost in double Super Over to ~~KKR~~ KXIP

The rest of the matches we're largely decisive wins. Feeling pretty good as an MI fan going into the playoffs..... Here's hoping Rohit gets back healthy and into form soon.",10
Jadeja has bowled shit throughout this season. Surely Ashwin gonna play ahead for him in Aus Tests?,3
That shot reduced Jadeja's manhood by 50 percent,1
Sanjay’s dugout speech lmao,5
Amitabh shilling out to the Saudis...,3
Lmaoooo,2
Are we going to have a \`CSK fan sadness\` thread after every game they lose the rest of this season?,2
Anybody else feels MI and RCB will occupy top 2 spot and DC third?,2
Banger is so pampered in dugout and its cute.,6
Rohit be like ab meri opening bhi khatre me,4
Swann’s got a good pirate impression,5
Should have bowled Curran in the powerplay as he can swing it,3
It’s all about confidence . Ishan Kishan being at MI feels like a champion walking out every time and plays with that mindset . Many players don’t get that luxury . That’s why the winning habit is so important .,7
"No Need to Bowl curran now, match is over no need to ruin his stats",2
Swann is like that teacher who tries to encourage the quiet kid to speak out more when he deals with Bangar,3
"With next IPL coming in 5 months and no auctions, I am worried for the future of CSK.",3
"Why aren’t they bowling Curran? It’s like in gully cricket , you batted too much, now others will get a chance to bowl",1
[removed],1
I made SKY my dream 11 captain fucker might not evey bat today.,6
"It's making me sad how Tahir was yelling to the fielders in his last over, trying to show intent and bring intensity but everyone else is just like completely deflated.",3
"Since Dhoni is on about the conditions becoming better for batting, it might be time to finally admit the his World Cup final innings came in significantly easier conditions on a dew ridden pitch after Gambhir played out the hard conditions. And for that reason alone, Gambhir deserved the MOTM.",4
Haar k bezti karane wale ko CsK kehte h 😎,2
"Sanjay on getting one right: ""I want to thank my parents"", jee that's actually a good one from Sanjay, for a change.",3
Look how they massacred csk,2
Guess the 3 super overs  in a day drained out all the excitement,6
Scenes if MI finish the game off earlier than RCB did against KKR lmao.,4
Every over Jadeja bowls is pushing him a little further out of the NT. He can't afford this with Axar sniffing,3
Even in normal 150+ chase 89-0 is pretty great. Let alone chasing 115.,3
For those who were wondering why Jaddu was not a must have for LOIs: this is why. He is a bit too predictable with the ball of late.,3
"E Raja Raja Raja, Jadeja mesamaja",5
Lol why the fuck Tahir's hair is being compared with Lady umpire,5
"So.. Kishan and Quinny to open.

Rohit 3?",7
Here is Tahir. Y’all wanted to see him right? Let’s see if he can win the game.,1
Sanjay banger still acts better than most Bollywood stars.,6
Swanny is amazing.. 100 times better than dull commentary,5
Hope Thala the strategist retires after this IPL.,6
"As if a fan would include ""dream 11"" ipl",5
Would Tahir do a running celebration if he got a wicket here?,5
Thala is going to get trolled till death,6
"Wait, does Tahir always come in from midwicket in his bowling run-up or just me noticing it for the first time?",4
"> Teams getting good starts 

CSK be like ""What is that?""",6
I love tahir,2
Let's see who does Thala blame this time. Lol,5
"The best part of this ipl has been graemme swann, he is just seems to genuinely enjoy what he is doing and it is amazing.",13
when was the last time Jadeja bowled an economical over that you expect from a spinner?,4
ruthless pen library nippy disgusted deserve grab muddle secretive tart ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `,18
Don't even deserve a pity wicket tbh.,5
"Two left handers are batting 


Msd: gives ball to leg spinner and a left arm bowler",9
I wanna see Imran Tahir get a wicket and run to the boundary now and see the commentators have a wet dream about his passion,8
So the way Kishan is playing chances for Samson to be 2nd option keeper is getting really less...,9
CSK saving the review just in case they need it later,15
Ishan kishan is trying to blast every ball to dubai from sharjah,11
"Pretty sure CSK supporters will be feeling like Deccan Chargers supporters did in 2011 and 2012. After 2 great years, two years of shit. Same team will play next year if no mega auction.",10
"I am wondering if I should upload this match to Liveleak or Pornhub. 


Also suggest me titles.",5
Steyn & Tahir with head bands. Looks like that is back in fashion :),5
The closest CSK has gotten to a wicket is a subdued LBW appeal. Lol.,10
Now dragging this to the 20th over would be an absolute power move.,4
QdK showing really good maturity here. A younger version of him would have tried to match Kishan shot for shot but he's been sensible and trying to get the man in form on the day more of the strike.,10
Have zero empathy for CSK just because of their arrogant ass fans.,14
Csk management is gonna completely rejuvenate their squad next year. Will be surprised if jadeja kedar and piyush survive,2
Kishan is just bullying them now,3
"Ngl at a quick glance, Tahir looks a lot like xqc if he had a beard",4
Nice six✌🏽😁🤟🏽,0

"inb4 MS ""The Pitch Got Better in Second Innings"" Dhoni",9

Shit happens, can't blame any particular player.",5
"Huuuuuuge, also my body cannot handle so much Intent™",5
Kishan made 70% of runs till now,2
Kishan basically ruined De Kock's streak,1
Replacement for jadeja is needed. It's either krunal or lord or axar,5
I can only imagine how chad Ishan must be feeling right now after hitting such neat sixes.,2
" damn it the only reason I'm even watching is to see Tahir take a wicket, run and celebrate.",2
These Ambani's have to employ pitch changing procedures to win against chennai.,0
This week has been full of comfortable chases. Guess it was inevitable after that crazy weekend.,5
So much for the theory that selecting Tahir would make a difference.,0
Would this be top 3 defeats for chennai if the match finishes in 2-3 overs without any wickets?,1
"Rest of csk : 😓🥺

KM Asif, Sai Kishore and Monu Kumar: 😬👀",5
"I love seeing us beat CSK, but I'm sad that it is Tahir. He deserved a good farewell from the IPL.",4

"Friendship ended with Rohit. 

Now my best friend is Kishan.",13

"\>required RR: 0.76

idk if they'll be able to do it lads",3
De cock just fucked csk,-3
Next time Chennai should fly with Cheapuk pitch everywhere.,11
"Jesus, he CANNOT catch a break",11
Lmao,3
Pollard just let Chennai bat all the overs so that he may get a chance to bat but the openers had other ideas.,13
Poor jagadeeshan,6
"At least, KKR managed to pick a couple of wickets lmao. This is just carnage.",13
Guys. I think CSK are not winning this.,13
Nothing going their way today,9
Lmao Jaggu boi,4
No spark what so ever. Poor from Rutu,5
Is there a reason Curran hasn’t bowled a single over yet or is it a bad attempt at playing 7D chess,8
RRR 0.86,8
Another drop by a youngster,15
Csk really made even a match on Sharjah boring.,16
Thanks for saving the NRR Gaikwad,13
No spark,7
COVID has affected gaikwads brain,4
Lmfao. Sparked the drop,6
not me showing up at the last 10 mins of the game expecting to see a thrilling chase n I get this,7
"Required run rate 0.76

MI is in trouble.",8
My boy Jagadeesan,6
Gaikwad's last ipl match in his career.,5
Now I understand Dhoni's Spark comment,7
This is the missing spark MSD was complaining about ...,8
And another youngster who will be set on fire and made the scapegoat,7
So do people change flairs after their team is out to the second fav team? What's the usual order of business? Never done this before.,11
MI gonna take a huge lead by the end of this innings. Big task ahead for Chennai SuperTest Kings in the 2nd innings!,14
"What a defense, MS is proud",8
Dropped the cup there mate.,14
[removed],7
I saw a spark as the ball rubbed through the hands and popped out I think,8
God bless mi NRR after this,10
"I liked when Koach said after the collapse (some previous year) - ""theres nothing really to talk about"". But Dhoni like to be chanakya and his fans keep feeding of his hollow talks.",19
11 oldies fucked by 2 petite teenagers,20
Inb4 Dhoni says the pitch changed in the second innings which is why they couldn't take wickets,8
This is what happens to newcomers when captain doesn't show any confidence in you.,15
"The glorious days of CSK are over and hopefully this might be the last season for mi too.
The future belongs to the other six teams now
/s",0
CSK is the first team to disqualify 💔,6
Bold prediction: I feel gaikwad isn't going to be Csk's future.,5
Lol CSK youngsters look miserable. They look like they can't wait to get out of Thala's CSK.,3
Csk fans dont be sad. Csk is qualified anyway. ^qualified ^for ^dubai ^airport,10
"lmao give sam curran the last over, csk got nothing to lose",1
Not sure about their batting but the fielding of these youngsters definitely lacks spark.,2
Anyone remember that guy who winked at Pollard and got smacked around later? Which match was that?,2
Ruttu :(,3
"RIP to CSK, I wish things were different",2
"Rohit promised the team he'd buy them vada pavs if they ended the match under 12 overs.

Turns out, he took off today so he could eat them himself on the sideline.",13
hahahaha why should the fielders be left behind?,4
If they bowled out Bumrah and Boult earlier we could have finished this match by 10. At least the batsmen are ruthless.,4
Cant wait to hear Srikkanth..,2
Friendly reminder: IPL 14 is six months away 😜,7
"0.7 Required rate, I don’t think MI will make it lads /s",9
Such blatant favoritism shown by IPl mgmt towards MI. How can they schedule a practice match for them against csk when others teams are playing real matches against proper team. Smh.,13
"Well, atleast Dhoni can blame Gaikwad in the post match ceremony.",10
I am loving how absolutely nonchalant these two are. Not a single emotion.,6
CSK at least had specialist fielder Dhruv Shorey in the team. Released him last season smh.,6
Well this is looking pretty *comprehensive*,3
Maybe all these newcomers need to sign with Thala's agency like Jadeja.,2
The fuck CSK even KKR is better than this against MI.,3
Everyone whistle in the air. Let’s do some podu tonight,2
"Process?

Spark?

What else",3
"I thought we could gain NRR by keeping KKR down to 84, instead MI will have a bigger NRR gain today lol....",5
Ruturaj can't catch a break lmao. Poor bloke.,7
I am all out of karma farming comments,3
BC it's Sam Curran vs MI,2
CSK made these shitcunts look like prime Australia. Get a grip grandpas,3
"Oof, feel bad for the lad",5
Can MI take it deep? Not even if they try...,6
MI should straight up declare nd bring CSK for the rest 10 overs lol,5
I would like to see Sam Curran bowl please,2
"Hey CSK, you know that guy who scored a 50 for you tonight? He bowls too!",6
"N Srinivasan was being so cocky talking about how Raina's absence wont impact the team.  
LOL",14
CSK could have 8 maiden overs in the next 9 overs .... and still lose.,1
230+ looks easy in next 9 overs with Polly and Harpic to come,8
Fun fact- shardul and rohit studied from the same school in mumbai.,11
"Cannot blame gaikwad he is given a chance because of fans wanting him in the team not dhoni. If dhoni wants him in the team that spark comment won't be brought up, or he would have known how to deal with an talented youngster.",1
Love Kishan's physique. Dude's muscular and buffed af. Love that shoulder and arms.,2
The most exciting thing of this match is going to be Dhoni's post match interview lmao.,13
"Meanwhile, Thala was right.  
No spark from CSK's youngsters today.

Thala can never be wrong. /s",8
[deleted],1
KXIP really pissed MI,2
Is that youngster fucking with Dhoni for the spark comment? Surely can't be this incompetent!,0
Looks like Ruturaj Gaikwad is offsetting all Gaikwad popularity that Sivajirao Gaikwad has built over the decades in Chennai.,4
At least the CSK team will have an early night.,1
What could Dhoni discussing to Tahir now? Dinner menu at hotel,5
Why was curran not given the ball? He could've done something with his swing.,6
"Come on QDK, end Csk's misery already",1
If they make 2-3 runs and take strategic timeout I'll be convinced that sponsors call shots in team selection and other shit,3
"All that NRR preservation earlier in the tournament was necessary. 

-1 certainly looks better than -2",4
All Chennai games have been so boring this IPL. Phew..,5
Gaikwad and Jagadeeshan seems more like club cricketers ideal for TNPL and not IPL. Sadly the fact that they seem better then Murali Vijay and Kedar Jadhav shows how shitty Stephen Fleming and co. have been at the auctions.,1
RCB fans please provide your qualifications probability excel template to csk fans.,3
"That's proper spanking, ah lads.",5
"You know your team is fucked when the fans start talking about the past more than the future.

Exhibit A: Manchester United",14
Why isn't Curran bowling.?,3
"Mumbai will have hard time retaining all their good players next year, they are just too many. Hope somebody grabs Kishan, hopefully srh ;)",2
They're not even gonna make it till the second time out xD,1
MOTM ?,1
Why the fuck is Scurran being used as a specialist batsman who bats at 7,5
wtf cock go for ur fifty,2
Guys just watch MSd's interview now,1
Wish him the best but Gaikwad ain't cut out for this stage right now.,5
loss of 9 overs is also loss of 9 overs of ad revenue for a 40 over game,5
Good guys MI trying to finish the match before CSK's bedtime.,14
"Gaikwad is my spirit animal, always nervous",5
"Imma take a leak and see if match still hasn't finished by the time I come back

Edit : Guess it didn't finish yet",6
If CsK ain't gonna respect my man Curran then they can give him back,11
Scenes if the final is SRH vs RCB,7
I can see Mumbai Indians or kings winning the IPL this year.,3
De Kock trying his best to stay not out lol,2
Boult or Kishan MOTM? I'd say Boult.,5
"WOW CSK has been absolutely crushed. Hopefully Dhoni retires after this season and CSK goes for full reboot. This team has run its course. Only Curran, Jadeja and Chahar are worth retaining.",1
Wtf is fair play award?,2
"Fuck result, I am here for post match talk by Dhoni",2
Ceat - we need that mandatory timeout. Slow down the chase,3
Will be interesting to see how people defend thala on twitter lool,4
Let CSK win the Fair Play award atleast xD,6
Just need Kings to win tomorrow please,4
Why didnt Curran bowl?,3
"I hope Boult gets the MOTM, last time vs KKR Rahul Chahar should been MOTM imo",4
"As someone who has vehemently supported Delhi and even shit on Mumbai this season, I can say with confidence that Mumbai deserve to be on top at this point. 

Delhi seem to be fading away when it matters like always. Need to get their act together if they want top 2 which they will require with their inexperience in the playoffs.",8
Need some hammering to create spark,5
"Well, at least we are getting a Viking funeral: put on the boat back, burned and sunk to to bottom. Valhalla awaits brothers and sisters!",3
If they make 2-3 runs and take strategic timeout I'll be convinced that sponsors call shots in team selection and other shit,5
Id rather lose like this than a 125/5 batting performance in 20 overs. Any day,10
Finish with 115 in 11.5,4
Those poor NRR Sixes hit by Dhoni :(,8
"Imma just gonna slip this in here... Thanks everyone of the match threads. The banter, the bullshit, the up (and down) votes, the relative freedom for us all to fuck around and just enjoy some cricket.

I am very grateful for these 15:00 (UK time) games, indeed for you all. Even that cunt who had bad things to say about my man Buttlerfingers! I will find you. I will kill you 🤣.

#\#HallaBol",23
Qdk trolling now,4
I’ll consider this as a loss if I’m forced to watch a Ad break timeout,7
Reckon they should score another 100-150 before enforcing a follow on,10
A young lad just cucked senior citizens . Arrest him /s,0
So wait Sharjah is still the same old Sharjah                                  🔫 Always Has Been,3
Showerthought: Maybe the CSK youngsters have shown absolute dogshit commitment during training and this is why MSD came out with that comment.,13
"Why is QDK defending all of a sudden, Spank it for a six daddy",2
At this point CSK should just book 11pm Dubai to mumbai flight back home.,8
"Bhogle be like “where do CSK go from here ? “ 
It’s simple ! India dude India !",15
Murali Vijay? I hope Sunny G is just trolling.,8
"I dont like to tinker with what works, but I dont mind if Rohit goes 3. Reason is Ishan is more effective in PP. 2 aggressive openers can be headache for opposition captain. Rohit is good anywhere and if he stays for a while, the field or ground size becomes irrelevant.

Also gives depth the likes of Pandya brothers and Pollard later.",8
Dhoni- well we brought in youngsters but it takes time for them to settle and play . We will focus on the process .,5
"They're playing for the strategic timeout, The broadcasters need money",3
Poonjab,3
"Feel like Swann is making fun of Sanjay when he says he loves his English, and it's not pretty",4
I think ppl aren't pissed at Dhoni just coz of his performance lately but also for his fing hypocrisy. He kicked all the seniors out coz of non performance when he was captain but now he's not ready to hang his own boots.,8
Sunny G seriously suggesting CSK should’ve picked Murali Vijay. 2020 couldn’t get any weirder,6
Mumbai is filled with IPL bullies like Bumrah. Chennai will always be the king of the Indian regiment. Won a world cup and champions trophy.,-15
"If imran Tahir gets a wicket now, will he celebrate",7
CSK will be the first team in history not to win matches and also not to win hearts.,12
"Opening with Vijay, what has sunny been smoking",4
Just wanted Tahir to get a wicket and do his trademark run...,8
"Something is wrong with the csk dugout and team it's like they gave up after the second game itself , nobody looks content or youngsters not confident about their position.",5
If they finish within this over then there'll be no timeout shit. PLEASE KHATAM KARO!,9
MI playing for the strategic timeout,3
How is 'cool as cucumber' Dhoni still keeping so calm in the face of an absolute thrashing?,8
"Damn, imagine blaming Dhoni for the bloke not being able to ground field or catch the ball. 

It's almost patronising to say that the young guys are not at fault. 

Even with respect to taking strike, if the lad hadn't faced Boult straight up, eventually in a few balls he'd have to face him or even tougher, Bumrah the next over.",10
It’s can’t be real that the controversial spark youngsters got out for a duck. The universe likes to fuck with us.,3
What a borefest,1
Ambani giving silver to the match bot,18
RCB the true kings of the south!!,9
Bangar sounds uncharacteristically more enthusiastic today. Loving this change 👌,6
MI trying to finish the match early so uncles can get their tablets in time,5
I like Pant just as much Sanju and Ishan. But what does he do so special that he was picked ahead?,3
The real question is whether QDK can get his fifty or not,10
Was that Mike Hussey just there? Just pick him.,24
"Lara and Swanny wishing Star Sports end doing "" Will Thala Dhoni comeback?"" Little do they know post match is all about "" Thala Dhoni already looking ahead with 2021 Season guys , Whistle will be podu for sure Brian😃""",3
MI should declare their innings to pay respect to Dhoni and top both fair play and IPL table,4
"Hear me out, not giving excuses. CSK picked a team in the draft to play half of their games in spinning and low tracks of Chennai, got shafted when they had to change their home venue to Pune and now to UAE.",19
Wtf is this tuktuk BS in the end. Wrap it up boys.,11
When is the second innings for CSK... ?,7
Gaikwad's first and last match in his career,6
[deleted],23
Finish this ffs,3
csk puppy shame,6
I just feel like RCB is not playing games that often or I am just a ABD fanboy,6
Fuck you CEAT,8
NRR go brrr.,3
Gg,2
Total Annihilation,7
F,2
And so the final over starts,4
Ok now we are out of playoffs.,5
How come Ishan Krishan is not talked about while Samson is hailed as a prodigy?,13
"This match is just a big ""stop he is already dead"" moment.",28
[deleted],15
[deleted],-3
Thank you Mumbai for no second shittergic timeout.,11
That's all folks.,2
"Bowlers steamroll oppositions, r/cricket: wHaT a BoReFeSt.",13
Proper knockout punch,3
Mumbai chasing the target in 12.2 is effectively their way of euthanising Chennai.,8
Strange that Curran didn't bowl today and bowled 1 over last game. Are CSK using him as a specialist batsman or some shit?,15
The cliffhanger of a match finally came to an end.,16
"What a fucking win, 10 rasclart wickets, are you fucking mad",3
"""fuck you MI for robbing me off my ad money"" - MS",16
CSK taking it deep,2
match summary has me dead,6
Now for the most interesting part of the game.,9
"Hmmm now I understand why Polly didn't bowl Bumrah and Boulty after 47/7 demolition, he wanted to put some runs on the board so that IK can get his form back. Captiancy 100",31
To be stuck in the bubble if you're a CSK player must be hell.,7
There needs to be a serious investigation into doctoring the pitch for their batting by Mumbai taking the advantage of lack of spectators.,5
De Kock is getting itchy. Lol,7
Dhoni big brain by bringing jaggu and gaikwad for this match,12
Lose by 10 wickets oooofff,5
"Defending champions

Except for the forever cursed first match Mumbai Indians has either completely fucking obliterated the opponents in a one sided match or have lost only in super overs, none in between

They just haven't been overpowered by the opponents yet",18
It's ok bois we still have a chance /s,11
THALA NRR go burrrr,14
Delete club,8
"MI's NRR in the table only went from 1.201 to 1.448.

Oof. I thought for sure it was gonna make a much bigger jump.",13
Utter domination. We were great rivals CSK. And in our storied rivalry this has to be the dullest match ever. Not at all el clasico this. Bounce back mothafuckas.,23
Are CSK out for sure or do they still have a chance?,9
"""In a two horse race they came fourth"" -Graeme Swann",47
That wasn't a win... That was a public execution of CSK,15
"Nothing feels better other than saying, fck CSK. Lol",12
+1.45 nrr lol,9
"This match reminded me of that Arya Gurukul vs. KC Gandhi School.  


Ishan Kishan was Dhanawade all along!",14
Watson is the second highest run scorer for CSK this season. Goes on to show how shit they were.,15
Our NRR goes from +1.201 to +1.448,17
A huge thank you Kishan and de Kock for finishing the match before another CEAT Strategic Timeout™,15
Like watching an unstoppable force meet a wall made of one sheet of wet paper.,14
This match feels like the Bayern- Barca match this year. Everyone knew one team was stronger but no one expected the result to be like this.,7
MI beat CSK by 10 wickets. CSK beat KXIP by 10 wickets. KXIP beat MI after 2 super overs. Some of the rarest ways to win,13
Fun fact : both Unmukt Chand & QDK played one the same U19 World Cup,14
This might have been the most dominating match of the season,10
"Such a nail-biting match.truly captures the spirit if this tournament
El classico they said, very well Said",11
Its easy to support teams when they are on top. Takes real fans to support them when stuggling. Also takes real fans to provide real constructive criticism. Hope we can rebuild and be back soon. 💪🏽,4
Can't wait for the how CSK can still make playoffs table math post.,12
Who is exited for tomorrow's super over,13
Ishan Kishan could be a good jockey with his short height. He certainly rode CSK hard.,6
Ishan Kishan >>>>> Samson,2
MS face looks like he is in the playoffs,1
How does their nrr only go from 1.20 to 1.45 after that demolition derby?,4
This is like Real Madrid defeating Barcelona 4-0 at the Camp Nou,6
The team that played for NRR with a solid one of -0.73,10
Ishan with his Kishan and Quinton with his Kock plowed MI towards victory,15
I'd really appreciate it if Dhoni just says that they played shit instead of trying to blame anything at all,6
Oh boi. I've enjoyed this absolute humiliation of CSK so much. Just because of the overly toxic fans. Feelsgoodman,10
Hard luck CSK. GG Mumbai. You have been pretty clinical.,5
MI marching to the top position beating CCSK placed last on the table. Feels good man,8
Our NRR just keeps on flying lmao,9
Pretty sure Kishan is already in Fleming’s notebook on the list of “must buy” players in the next auction. Hold onto him MI!,24
Waiting for Thala's speech,10
De(MI)se of CSK!,9
Why didn’t they even try bowling Sam?? he was the only CSK with his head in the game,21
"Even if you add all other teams positive NRRs, that won't be closer to MI's",30
I first saw The tattoo written on Saurabh Tiwary's hand and read it as impostor instead of warrior.,6
Damn Dhoni looks like he's about to cry.,15
CSK going from having haters to sympathizers overnight,37
Blame it on 2020,4
"On point advertising after CSK lose by ten wickets, 'CSK: Roar of the Lion'.",14
_it hardly matters_,12
I heard Saurabh Tiwary managed to bag a MRF sponsorship for the tyre around his belly.,27
I can feel Dhoni's anger through my screen.,12
Thala will bring back lord jadhav in the next game.,8
Tomorrow's Stoin vs Eoin,9
All the players are hurting- Thala. Yes they are hurting because of the comments you made last time.,21
The highlights of this game will be on pornhub,14
"Report /u/talhaaaa14 for abuse

CSK has never lost by 10 wickets before. Well they better get used to it.,24
Can kishan compete with pant for the wk spot in team india?,13
"MI opening with QdK and Ishan

*""This is getting out of hand, now there's two of them""*",48
Yeah blame luck. That's what's been missing.,12
"Dhoni has gone from Thala in Tamil to Thala in Bengali.

Thala - Bengali - Plate!",22
El Classico of IPL more like Fail Classico of IPL,28
We CSK deserved this. Well played MI,10
Never have I ever thought I'll see a worse loss than the KKR one in this season.,13
"BC Raina made a good decision. Lol
He didn't want any of this shitfest.",28
Dhoni is super angry behind that calm face. It reminds me of my mom trying to fake smile in front of the teacher for my terrible performance and later she shouts at home.,22
We want a better script for the weekend.,12
Incoming 100 posts about csk,6
"MS again: rayadu was injured, and others wouldn’t perform. Ok ok.",23
"IK should be given a chance in the Indian XI. I know KL is doing great but IK batting seems to be much better balanced than Pant. If he can build a temperament, he can be really good.",4
Thala don't cry 🥺 it's just a game,9
Ffs stop blaming the pitch,17
"Woah Dhoni blaming everything in the world. Dew, Toss,   luck. Come on Dhoni",24
I'm so eagerly waiting to see what Dhoni has to say.,8
Bruuuhhh.. He asked Dhoni is not playing on your home pitch a cause for this result.,27
[deleted],10
Ah nothing gives me orgasm more than trashing csk,13
MI looks like they're gonna be winning this year. I hope they don't.,12
"Chepauk Super Kings, Chennai Senile Kings,  Chennai Spinning Kings 

Pick your franchise name.",20
Dhoni going very philosophical here,13
Lets just block all the csk and dhoni posts for the rest of the ipl. They are cringe.,11
"Bruh just take responsibility

Blaming literally everything apart from himself",19
"This wasn't a match, this was a sextape",19
Plays 1 good innings - is this a pant replacement?,11
Ambani played his innings well today,-41
Definitely the lowest point in csk history,27
The commentator taking dhoni for a ride,15
I am [sorry!](https://old.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jglteq/match_thread_41st_match_chennai_super_kings_v/g9r6srp/),12
'Spark' has turned into 'luck'. Dew has also been blamed. Thala be original pls,12
"Imagine being Pant,every single fucking day youngsters perform and people start talking about removing you and your position remains threatened in the Indian team  after every Ipl match.",29
Now one CSK guy will come with a well analysed chart showing how CSK can qualify with 12 pts. Fuck you bro FUCK YOU,38
"""Youngsters are trying their best to perform. Maybe they're not able to perform"" what a joke. Maybe they'd stand a chance if you actually backed them",14
Dhoni should just say that we didn’t plan well for this edition and didn’t plan well for the future . We will look to improve on that for the next season . And end it .,18
MS indicates: panic incoming in the dressing room,14
Thala isnt retiring I can tell you that.,16
"One more season without a mega auction. The other 7 teams should vote for this, they all have likely settled teams barring minor adjustments.",10
Lmao look at the blame games,16
"My God, look at Dhoni's top quality game - the blame game!",17
"Typical MSD post match interview. Calm and composed, not showing too much emotion",13
CSK scooter needs a change of spark plug,2
Commentator still sucking up to MSD. No need for that,1
Mark Nicholas just focus more on getting players' names right and less on fanboying for Dhoni,11
since CSKs pretty much out of the tournament RCB and DCs fan base is about to double.,12
"Dhoni wanna make 20 crore more next year, so wont retire. Smart guy",9
Did he take a shot at DK by saying the captain is not gonna run away?,11
CSK going all out for double headed coin and dew in next auction,6
15 wins in a row as captain of MI for Pollard. Did not know this.,24
Don't let this 10 wicket shellacking distract you from the fact that KXIP actually lost by 10 wickets to this version of CSK. Lol,40
For the record CSK was really close to buying Kishan in 2018. But apparently Fleming is a stingy guy. Ended up losing him to MI and finishing the auction with over 6 Cr to spare. They could’ve easily gotten him.,20
"What interviewer wanted to hear : It's our fault for not picking best team and playing our best.




What Dhoni said : *Greh bure chalre*",23
It does take some effort to smile like that thou! Kudos MS!,13
Why does it feel like Dhoni always talks about batting not clicking and conviniently not include his abysmal batting form,17
Only thing that went Dhoni's way ironically were the youngsters failing and not showing any spark,28

Sanju Samson falling behind Ishan Kishan in the Indian wicket keeping sweepstakes.,12
I always have that spoiled brat image for Ishan. Courtesy that Netflix show,14
These kind of totals are always difficult - ishan kishan,19
Oh boy! MS is surely gonna run away by next year.,9
"Probably wont happen due to the marketing side. But if it was purely about cricketing skills and winning games, then CSK management would release Dhoni.",18
[removed],-8
Why wasn't Rohit playing today?,6
Kishan sounds like not kishan.,15
Does anyone else also think that Dhoni doesn't answer the questions straight and brings up some motivational stuff out of context?,15
Love how this guy doesn't give a fuck lol. Chewing gum when Nicholas is speaking.,25
Good night to everyone except those who were calling this whitewash 'El Clasico',23
"Didn't watch the post match presentation yet, but here's my bingo:

1. Pitch got infinitely better in the second innings

Update: 
Dhoni: no dew when we batted, but when they came to bat, a lot of dew came in all of a sudden.

All the downvoters can suck it",12

So we'll probably see Asif and Monu Kumar in the next games! And Gaikwad and Jagadeeshan will bat at those positions too! Good to hear that! And way to blow that out of proportion guys!,8
"Kishan should have completed his thought.

Csk are experienced side they have won 3 ipls and qualified every single time.

And by playing this innings i helped knock them out of this tournament.

I am very happy with my performance.",12

"Chahar and Jadeja are the only 2 players who've looked like they had their shit together this IPL. Faf fired at the start but fizzled out. Rayudu is hit or miss. Dhoni, Watto, Jadhav, sparkling youngsters have all been pretty much shit this IPL. 

How ironic the only 2 players who are fighting for a position in the playing Indian 11 are trying to lift CSK on their backs.

Edit: Forgot Sam Curran so apologies to the lone international warrior.",19
ok maybe watson wasn't that bad. Come back watto uncle they need your spark.,26
"Petition for building Pollard Statue at Nariman Point, Mumbai",25
Why is no one talking about the edge on Gaikwad's LBW? Has Ambani bought you lot who are here too? Get out of your Jio shell for once sell-outs.,-31
"It doesn’t seem like CSK would put up a fight in the upcoming games either. Surely, the playoff spots are all but sealed. Maybe KKR and KXIP would contest for the fourth spot",12
I love Sunny but he is biased towards Mumbai Indians and Mumbaikars.,18
Mark this post nsfw,12
Shut up Sunny G! Why is he still there? Manju/GG was better than this,4
"considering himself, half the stuff Dhoni says in interview is purest irony you will ever see",24
"lol Even when we just batted 12 overs this match thread has 8.5K comments, even fans of other teams are enjoying this",30
"I can see MI rooting for ishan kishan for the long run. He was the captain of the u19 team and may become captain for MI in future. Pant has been shit this season, so maybe ishan gets chance in team india",12

Wtf sunny saying Murali Vijay should have played today . I don’t get this criticism about not having intent . Intent will come only if you have the skills and confidence . Sadly csk players are all well past their prime .,15
A team who have won 2 trophies by mere difference of 1 run are saying luck isn't a factor lol,23
Is Sunny G high? Keeps repeating why not play M Vijay. I mean seriously! Was he sleeping during the initial IPL games?,41
People say that Unadkat is a money laundering scheme while the actual one is Dream 11.,27
"mark: i hope you play all the remaining matches

dhoni: well, captain can't really run away

gambhir rn: https://i.imgur.com/ebH9WyK.jpg",28
"Phew seeing the pich play in First inning , I though Mumbai would find it hard chasing, my though this being a even year and we had lost same game to srh in 2018 where we failed to chase 118",16
Imagine if this match was a final.,24
"So this is CSK's first defeat by 10 wkts, ever!

Previous was by 9 wkts. That too was against MI.

The number of times Gavaskar has criticised not playing M Vijay is MUCH higher than the number of runs he actually made in his first few IPL games this year,36
"Dhoni would do really well defending a thesis. 

*""So Dhenier PhD, what is the significance of a nucleoproton in quantum entanglement when under 3 quartz of pressure?""*

*""Well...it's about the process, you see, these younger protons wrap around the older protons, and because of the process of osmosis, they tangle around eachother, spinning with enough of torquing process to create a state of nucleosis - which is the process of these little processes. It is important for these little processes to show intent to work, and the younger protons need to show some spark!*

Sorry what was the question again?""",61
Ishan Kishan kinda looking like Kohli?,8
"Seriously, it looks like Dhoni just isn't giving any fuck to this team anymore.",27
"Where’s this sub that said give Rituraj Gaikwad a chance? 

Laughing my mofuckin ass Off",-63
"While the folks are in UAE, they should get their iphone purchases squared away since it is so expensive in india. And also buy a charger lol.",27
P R O C E S S,13
I don't know if Ishaan can be Pant's replacement but dude sure as hell deserves a chance in the team,16
The quality of commentators is seriously going down in cricket. Gavaskar keeps blurting Vijay’s name without having fact check the chances he got,19
"Pollard buddy grow that beard back, double chin not the best look",22
My well wishes to those few CsK fans who weren't toxic but will get mercilessly trolled anyway,49
"We should constantly change the middle order batsman at position 4.You know Samson is a beast in first games,Kishan is at another level in the middle games,Pant is fabulous and godly in the end matches so done.

Samson in 1st and 2nd match.

Kishan in 3rd and 4th match.

Pant in 5th match",30
Yeah even Pommy's energy is down reading out all these fucking pointless awards,19
"Wanted to blow these guys out so bad. Could have been much more comprehensive but glad we got it done.

Now on to RR.",12
[deleted],37
"Haha. What happened tonight? 

I was busy in some work and missed whole of match. Looks like CSK also had some work.",14
CSK has dug such a big hole that you can’t expect them to be party spoilers now for the remainder of the IPL,20
"for a dying csk, pls atleast beat rcb and then lose however badly u want",8
Thala:We just played 3 hrs of bad cricket today.,30
"Kudos to BCCI and UAE for hosting the tournament in such a smooth fashion despite the 'rona. Impressive stuff!

Dare I say, better planned out than NBA.",38
"I might be mistaken,  but did mi's NRR go from +1.7 to +1.4?",5
Pollard is just 33! Didn't expect that,43
"i dont understand the talk about csk getting in youth for the next season.

surely since experience has almost won them 2 titles, they'll go that way again? im not saying they'll keep the same squad but i expect them to get a new batch of oldies",20
all of this happened because faf wasnt in the strikers end to begin with. i mean why wud they send inexperienced ruturaj against boult,12
"Instagram is cancerous. Certain fan pages instead of saying csk didn't perform well have started posting images of ""this is the last time we might see Dhoni"" or ""he might not play again next year"" kinda emotional shit.  He's been terrible this year and so was entire team, and there were people defending and bashing someone who made some valid points. I mean wtf",57
Fuck it let's make Curran captain too,20
Not a big Dhoni fan. But I do want him to score good in a match or two.,18
RR MAKE BUTTLER CAPTAIN PLS!!!,9
"If Instagram like fans existed earlier, Kapil Dev and SunnyG would still be playing for India",46
These commentators have a tough job. Need to sugar coat everything they say about MS,65
i think watson shud have been there he wud have prevented the collapse,-8
"Hopefully, Delhi or RCB smack these umpire buyers into the shadow realm. A disgrace to the sport drop that ""Indians"" thing off you don't represent us.",-64
Csk is that student who carries cheating paper in the exam but still manages to fail.,14
"Dear Sunny,

No one is doubting Dhoni's captaincy credentials for India (best Indian captain in limited overs to date). It's just that he is past his prime and I think it is time for him to move on.",63
This thread was more interesting than the match itself.,28
"KKR on the 4th position since 21 days now. If KKR wins tomorrow, 25+ days guaranteed. Different level of luck is going in favour of the Knight Riders.",51
"[Get a load of this, are they still in with a chance?](https://imgur.com/a/kCFhQ76)",19
"It's alright anyways most of the team is retired and won't be playing next year, there were glimpses of the aging effect last year. 


I'm just looking forward to a good send off match and a  fresh restart where they could find and groom someone to whom MS can pass on the captaincy next year or 2022. 


10 years of dominance, not a small feat.",42
"**BBC** proving too much for CSK. 


Boult, Bumrah & Coulter",35
"Chill out guys, Sunny G goes soft on CsK and Dhoni because he knows he might very well get a chance in CsK squad as opener next season.",86
CSK vs RCB. 25-Oct. Spark vs Meme. Shitpost Sunday.,47
I really hope Kxip qualifies and makes it to the final and bottles the final so badly so that kl Rahul can finally prove that he is the one true successor of koach and Kxip becomes the new rcb,40
The most shocking thing of today's match was that it was played in Sharjah and had a low score.,35
"In my memory, I've never seen a worse performance by a team in a single edition of IPL. Sure teams have lost many games in a single season before, but the magnitude and manner of losses have never been this bad. CSK have looked bad right from the start in almost all the matches this season. Even my Delhi have never been this bad a couple of seasons back, despite being inexperienced and having one of the worst rosters.",42
"It's ok guys, the weekend script is always better",59
Jesus imagine having to face Boult and Bumrah..,49
Now where are all the Dhoni haters? What spark did Jagadeesan and Gaikwad show? 0 off 6 balls among both. Jadhav would have done better than this.,-78
How on earth do you score only 114 in 20 overs in SHARJAH?,24
"Unpopular opinion: If Mega auction are not held, CSK will obviously find it difficult next year. But even after Mega Auction, they won't have it easy.

Right now the Players worth retaining are Curran, Chahar, Jadeja but they will have to decide if the Trio are worth 33 crores of deduction from the purse money.",11
Ez4MI,-4
Isn’t it funny that you all were the same ones that argued against giving opportunity to the others in that case?,3
