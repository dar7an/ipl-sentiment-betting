Backing KKR,7
FINNALY IT'S OUR MATCH!,6
Just your daily reminder that Mumbai are yet to win a game in the UAE,74
"Here for the shits and giggles cause even year MI are bad as it is but this year is especially bad because of the combined team effort to get fatter together and become Memebai Chonkians.

One family hai, one rahenge aur ek saath bahut sara Vada pav bhi khayenge!!",11
Cant believe KKR looses a lot against MI.,6
[deleted],1
Never imagined I ll see Rcb at the top of points table,6
"Even though saurabh tiwari played well, I would want ishaan kishan to be in the playing 11. Even if it means dropping tiwari. Kishan is too good a player to be left out. He is the future of indian cricket.",4
"Feel like this IPL is going to do Cummins a lot of good. He's going to be under serious pressure to perform up to the level of his price tag especially at the death. No doubt, I back him to rise to the occasion even if it his weak point.",4
"Is it just me or is the KKR batting getting overhyped? I think it‚Äôs decent but Russell is their only real champion batsman imo. They do have a decent Indian contingent in Rana, DK and Gill but except Russell they have no other consistent and reliable explosive batsmen unless you want to count Narine. Don‚Äôt see how the batting at DC or MI is not superior and maybe even a Punjab frankly. I guess the difference seems to be that many people rate DK and Morgan up there or near about the Warners and DeVilliers of the game, which IMO is not really valid. Morgan is good for sure but more of a Williamson/Smith mould player imo and then DK to me is decent but again a level down from a Rahul or even an Iyer.",1
"Can we focus on strike rotation in the middle overs and putting bad balls away instead of heaving every ball towards cow corner?  We had 40 dot balls in the last match, that's a third of the entire innings. ABD and Kohli the other day putting pressure on the fielders was amazing and puts the batting team in a positive mindset to accelerate.",6
"With 3 gun pacers bowling in pp i dont think kkr shud send Narine to open. Rather they could open with someone like Rahul Tripathi who likes pace in the ball. 

Later Kkr can maybe send Narine as a pinch hitter when the leggie or left arm spinner is bowling. 

If narine opens its just a matter of time before his timber gets disarranged or he gets caught on a short ball.",1
Can DK make a come back to national side ?,-2
KKR loses to Mumbai most of the times and it is an even year for MI where they shit their bed. It is like an unstoppable force meets an immovable object when it comes to which one loses.,1
I'm ready to get hurt again,5
"Want to see that KKR middle order bat, also waiting to see Gill and Nagarkotti play well.",3
[deleted],-2
Nagarkoti sledges like a gangsta btw,4
"Mumbai have never won a game in the UAE, and are known for sucking terribly in the first stages of the tournament, particularly so in even years. 

Kolkata has not had a great run in general I'm recent times and have a history of being crap against Mumbai (6 wins against 19 losses throughout the tournament). 

This is a race to the bottom and I am here for it.",7
Nice of the Burj to do a lightshow of the KKR team yesterday. It will be symbolic after I fling myself off it after our inevitable loss today.,5
"I dont think Kuldeep has gotten over Moeen's spanking. In practice match, one six from Russell and his face went *hello darkness my old friend*.",20
"saw an interview with venky, baz, karthik and eoin. is eoin in the leadership group? or kkr going down the same shadow captain route this year as well?",4
Narine or banton dunno who's gonna be 4th foreigner,1
"I will now begin the new IPL season for KKR by telling everyone that ever since Baz scored 158* in the first ever IPL match, there has never been an individual centurion for the KKR.

Will this finally be the season? Let's see.",24
"What's the 1v1 record between these two, hardly ever see kkr beat MI",1
Don‚Äôt let the IPL distract you from the fact that Attack on Titan: The Final Season is airing from December 7th.,7
"Morgs Russ DK

I'd say subscribe tf outta this middle orderüî•",8

Supporting KKR tonight! Want a new IPL winner this season preferably RCB. DC and KXIP will also do.,5
"KKR has won 7 out of 7 opening matches of the IPL since 2013.

Let's go KKR.,4
"I am going to lose my mind, if Rohit gets out to Narine for the 1028292th time:/",4
[deleted],1
"Man if there's one team I hate us playing, it's MI",3
KKR's bowling looks weak,2
I just want Russel to bat from the 10th over,1
Will Rohit ever get pressure as he not performing (batting)in  IPL for 3 years straight now?,2
[deleted],3
Rohit loses another one,1
KKR chasing easy win,1
uggh lost the toss again. fml.,1
WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TEAM I SUPPORT ENDS UP LOSING THE TOSS?,3
Yesssss come on KKR,3
"I don't know if you guys noticed but Rohit is fat, what do you mean ""he's fit enough to play for India""? I can literally see that he's fat.

Upvotes to the left for my unique observation",2
Time for Rohit to stress eat some of that juicy fried Vada pav to bring the cortisol levels back under control.,2
Ffs Bumrah will have to have a great match if MI has to defend against Russell.,5
don't ever remember Rohit winning the toss,7
"It felt like bishop wanted rohit to say ""are maa chudi padi hai""",6
"The record for KKR is 6-19?!

How the fuck do you manage only 6 wins in 12 years",7
feeling like pure shit just want Ishu Kishu back,5
"Hardik made 91(34) against KKR last year, hoping for a repeat.",2
You fat fucks you're playing the same side again??? Fuckin chuttads!!,2
TIL arch rivals win 6 out of 25 games played,15
No nagar? Damn i wanted to see him :(,4
need mrs. ambani back in the stands doing her prayer thing for today.,5
No nagarkoti (‚ï¨‡≤†Áõä‡≤†),6
I hope Shivam Mavi plays well given Nagarkoti isn't playing,3
Why has Morgan never captained in the IPL? Defo best LOI in the world at the moment,7
Cummins paid around 6000 USD per ball.,12
üö®Nikhil Naik is playingüö®,5
CSK - MI are the only Arch-rivals.,7
"Why's KKR so obsessed with Nikhil Naik, didn't inspire any confidence the way he was playing last year and then the fact that they opened with him for a few matches instead of Gill was inexplicable",8
Why is Mavi playing instead of Prasidh or Nagarkoti !?!,5
"KKR top six looks good , bowling looks thin though.

Shubman Gill is opening as well, hope he plays well today",7
[removed],1
"And the wait to see Nagarkoti continues.

One of these days, I am going to send an angry(but respectful) email to KKR management and BCCI.",4
Why is the Cricket match bot an RCB supporter. Lol.,19
"Sandeep Warrier gang, what we saying",3

I don't understand the selection of Nikhil Naik. He was a waste last season.,6

"My batting line up for KKR

They have a big bowling problem,1
Hope Sandeep Warrier does well!,4
"Maviüò≠
Nikhil Naik üò≠üò≠",4
"Can I ask a question.

Nagarkoti was a beast in the U19 but will he able to show the same performance in senior sides. He's quite short for a fast bowler",3
"Shud have played Nagarkoti in place of Naik

What will a batsman at 7 do

Cummins n Nagarkoti r good enough to bat at 7 n 8

N that wud have boosted their bowling too",4
Fuck it kkr is the weakest ipl team this year,-1
Yo what happened to Chris Lynn??,3
No 8 position is reserved for kkr,2
Ishan Kishan sidelined yet again. MI if u don't need him give him to us.,1
So excited to see Shubman gill in his actual position and not being wasted at 6,3
"I remember that 2019 KKR opener against SRH. We had the game wrapped and then Russell happened. Impossible innings.

KKR won a lot last season on Russell's back. But then we always win on Warner's efforts, so who cares.",2
"KKR look good on paper; hopefully, they convert it. Of course, they have been good in their first matches of different IPLs.",3
"Morgan hasn't played in the IPL since 2017, and he was ordinary then

KKR are lacking in the batting, they need Gill to have an exceptional season",4
They should just ask Russell to pad up after the 12th over any wicket falls send him in doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs bowling or how many wickets have fallen that man will put fear in the opponents just by his presence,3
Did DK say he Narine will be opening? How are we so sure Naik will be coming at 8?,1
Why star sports suck Dhoni D so much?,5
No Banton no Party,1
Just happy to hear Harsha again,1
Daddy Harsha is back! Needed him during the 2nd innings,4
u/CricketMatchBot has an RCB flair lol !,5
"Can Nikhil naik reliably bowl overs? Seems weird to have him at 7 as a specialist bat and Russell as a 5th bowler doesn't inspire confidence.

Edit: Forgot Narine existed, I'm an idiot.",3
"I want to see a Hardik 100, Pollard 50, Hardik 5-fer, Russell 0. No, nothing to do with my fantasy team, why do you ask?",9

Looking forward to Duminy's stint in the commentary box. Should bring a good perspective having played almost every season and with different franchises.,4
Was KKR's profile photoshoot conducted in a Dark room? Had to take a hard look to recognise the players.,2
Cheering for KKR!,4
"Both teams have a lot of power hitters. Needless to say, excited to see an action packed game",5
UAE or MI ?,4
Is there a reason that KKR have selected Naik ahead of Tripathi? He has traditionally been excellent in the IPL and I‚Äôm surprised not to see him in the side.,1
Sounds like packed stadium,2
excited to see eoin morgan!!,5
Gill looks like he belongs to a dance troupe in the profile photo,4
just let this be a well fought game from mumbai!,2
"9am lecture at uni tomorrow which I have loads of work to do for and it‚Äôs the last night of pubs open late so I‚Äôll be going out. 

That means doing my work now but nah, I‚Äôll just sit on my arse on Reddit instead",9
I would have thought Morgan would captain? Maybe they stuck with dk cause he is more familiar with the team,3
MI need to play safe in the powerplay. No risks whatsoever,1
KKR would be title contenders if they didn't break the bank on Cummins and instead invested in a good Indian fast bowler.,-2
guys upvoot,2
Stream?,1
"Morgan should be KkR captain, is he not available for a full season",2
"CSK's lost one, MI's lost one... it's only fair if KKR loses one. Restore the balance IPL gods",4
"Honestly think banton should have played over Morgan today. Narine as an opener isn't gonna work against this bowling attack and morgan's ipl record doesn't inspire confidence, would rather have Banton opening with gill. No disrespect to Morgan intended.",3
Welcome back Harsha Bhogle! You've been missed!,4
What's the prediction?,2
Making DK the captain over Morgan is stupid imo,2
"So guys, what is your prediction about thicc boi? How much will thicc boi score today? Let me know",1
Both teams are likeable. Who should i support?,1
How much will Rohit score today,3
Kinda jealous with Mavi. Lad gets to learn from Cummins while getting paid.,3

i like the look of warrier.,2
How is Cummins in the death?,7
"Warrier looks good ao far , hope he can continue this through out the season",2
Rohit just needs to get his head down and get a start. The Russell factor makes me think even 200 will be too small a score for us.,2
Crowd is going wild for Rohit.,8
Good bowling so far,2
inb4 he gets smacked off the extra ball,38
"Was a good over until now,it‚Äôll get worse if the extra ball goes for a boundary",4

Russel doesn't need to run he compensates for them through his batting,2
Fielders showing a lot of intent. I love it.,5

"Not exaggerating but Cummins could genuinely turn out to be the worst purchase in IPL history. Value for money wise. Even at his best, he's an okayish T20 bowler, and on his bad days, he generally stinks. Hopefully not, though.",12
"Assuming KKR plays all possible matches (17) and Cummins balls in all of them, he is getting payed Rs.379901 per ball.",11
"Good idea by Brohit, if he can't run 3's, better hit some sixes!!",3

Haha the biggest buy of dinda achedemy am i right,4

"Can you imagine flying from Australia to the UAE wearing ridiculous quarantine gear, having a covid swab up your nose and staying in a biosecurity bubble only for Rohit to pull you off the front foot into the stands. Scenes",100

"Can everyone stop with Rohit‚Äôs weight? athletes burn a bunch of calories every day playing cricket and working out. He might have a slow metabolism or he might be eating a lot. So what? He runs faster than most in the outfield and is an excellent fielder. He paces his innings. If he doesn‚Äôt convert the 2s to 3s, he makes up for it with 2 sixes to Freakin‚Äô Cummins.   

The reason Kohli runs that hard: he‚Äôs admitted that his timing is not as good as Rohit‚Äôs, and he doesn‚Äôt open the innings (field restrictions)",3

Are those fans on the screen paid in any way?,3
What. A. Shot.,2
Cringe box,3
"Why did KKR even get Cummins for so much? He's essentially the same bowler as Lockie in this format. Plus they have Mavi, Krishna, Nagarkoti who also bowl 140+.",8
Holy cow what a shot,7
"What a beauty of a shot.

Lovely.",4

Suryakumar best Indian Non capped batsman??,26
"What a shot ! 

Whenever Kuldeep gets the ball in his hand

Me to the batsman - Do it, Just do it. Destroy him",2
Kulcha having war flashbacks to Mo Ali.,4
Surya will have a good season I think given his prowess against spin. Easily our best player of spin.,9
SKY is more of a prospect to me than Samson frankly!,1

A mouth watering battle",3
that was cricket 2007 shot,7
"SKY's performance in the IPL for the last 2-3 years is insane, deserves to play for India.",15
That‚Äôs a unbalanced hoick from SKY. The commentators are calling it the best shot of the day.,-9
Kuldeep looks like the lovechild of Yuvraj  and Sangakkara,10
4 boundary fielders should be given jetpacks to make it a fair game,3
That's one hell of a shot by sky,6
Lol that guy is named after the stadium,6

Jesus Sanjay bangar needs to go from Dugout,1
KKR sponsored by Dinda Academy today,3
Good start again. Hopefully we finish well unlike last time,1
Calm down guys. Dont get fooled by the runrate. Mumbai cruising to their usual 170-180 score,8
I understand having women commentators but god isha guha makes my ears hurt,3
"Dinesh ""Tom Cruise"" Karthik the way he runs around every ball",4
Don't understand how SKY never got picked for India.,8
Suryakumar Yadav is one of those players who delivers great value year on year to his IPL team ... really so much better than overpaid types like Yuvraj in his later years.,12
"Purchased for 15 crores, gives 15 runs in first over!",2
Bish is such a good commentator. He thinks a lot about the game and doesn't just blabber anything. Love love love him.,7
"Both of them playing well with their strengths and not risking much, hope one of them stays till the end",2
Does narine still play for West indies in any format?,4
"""Nothing more alpha than picking a googly and going with the turn and hitting a six""

First time in a while the cricinfo commentary has said something original and worthwhile",10
hardik sounds like an indian pete davidson lol,3
That is insane wristwork. Must have been a big fan of Savita bhabhi in his childhood,10
If they make Kuldeep cry again I'll change my flair to MI,7
KKR jersey reminds me of Hide & Seek biscuit wrapper.,68
I fear if kuldeep doesn't perform well in this IPL koach and bevda will drop him from the Indian side...,3
Imo they should having more stringent criteria‚Äôs set when selecting commentators.,4
"MF Kuldeep spent the whole lockdown giving interviews about how he's feeling confident, only to get advice from DK after 3 balls.",35
This batting is pure p0rn,4
"KKR against other IPL teams: üëë 

KKR against Mumbai Indians: üí©",6
Ngl that Pharmeasy ad is funny!,3
Suryakumar Yadav can start his own sports academy and call it SKY sports academy without copyright concerns,40
Is hostages like money heist? Every episode opens with a problem which seems big but turns out they already have a plan for it?,1
Darren Gough.. what an actor,2
that's ana de armas right?,5
"It's morally wrong to tease a child. Specially when he starts crying. But quite often we find a strong urge just to pull their leg to see them freak out and throw a tantrum.

I feel the same way about KulDeep. I don't want to really see him hurt but I just wish batsmen would hit him for 6 sixes in an over. Just to pull his leg",3
After seeing this ad I've realized how good TikTok was for not advertising this cringe.,3
"Unlike other players who are immediately hyped here after scoring a few runs, SuryaKumar Yadav is someone who actually backs it up with a great domestic record as well. 900+ runs in last two IPL seasons, and a fifty almost every game for Mumbai irrespective of the format",5
Someone has the insta for that diamond model?,2

Narine will get Rohit this over or else my fantasy team is doomed,7
We have two Tamil commentators who have nothing to do with cricket . actually they are better than English commentary.,8
Rohit eating vada pav in timeout?!,4
Unpopular opinion: Suryakumar should be in the team. Atleast he should be given a chance.,12
Turn down for strategic time out because obviously players don't get enough time to strategize before the match .,2
man this kkr bowling lineup seems very poor!,8
"My boy Harsha, it's so good to have him back.",4
8 overs and 6 bowlers,5
I can't help but get triggered when I see these scammy ads of Byju's and WhiteHatJr,13
Mumbai should just play out Narine,5
Good to hear Harsha .,6
If you bowl with illegal action in ipl can icc ban you.,2

"Sanju Samson and SKY deserves a chance in the Indian team, at least in T20 format.",3
"I don't see guys with KKR flair, silent or not many ?",9
"Yeah that's it play out Narine, Brohit.",2
This is an excellent start on a big ground and their best batsmen of the season hasn't even entered yet!,1

Why did we let SKY go :(,4
Same match as yesterday so far,3
"Rohit something something vAda pAo

Hardik and Pollard better come next instead of Tiwary,10
"And just like that, one good over brings the run rate under 10",8
I'm not a violent man but you could throw that WhiteHatJr kid into a woodchipper and I would feel nothing.,87
"200 is back on the menu, boys",7
I want 220,6
"So much talk about KKR bowling. Keep calm guys, Their batting will easily chase anything under 250.",1
"If these guys don‚Äôt get Rohit before 15 overs, they‚Äôre fucked",9
Is the lenskart ad sexist?? :/,7
Can Rohit score a double century today ?,5
One of my biggest qualms with Surya is that even though he's fairly consistent he rarely ever goes big. He gets these fluent 50s and 60s and then throws it away.,1
"Brendon McCullum says : We have bowl well, just a little short",5
Deepika is wearing that jeans the way I used to wear my school uniform pants. Right up to the belly.,9

Ah yes I remember this. Pre-Moeen Kuldeep! Missed him the WC,1
McCullum looking fitter than his entire team,7

Another spinner bowling a no ball after Chawla yesterday,5

He has bowled a no ball and not murdered anyone ffs",6
Umpire after signalling no ball - What you gonna do ? Cry ?,6
Spinners have been bowling a lot of no-balls this IPL. Surprising.,9
That's the worst free hit shot ever. Ever.,3
Man this siren and fake noises must make them feel as if they're in a computer game.,12
Danny is commentating. Did someone say he's missing this time?,3
Baz Mccullum deserves much more than to be a dugout unkil.,4
"BONK

Go to Cricket jail",7
If Rohit get anymore fatter he could do the Ben10 cannon bolt thing to steal runs.,9
McCullum shamed like nothing else. XD,4
You really need to try hard to bowl a no ball as a spinner,7
"BM: this will be a high scoring game. 

Watch KKR get bundled for 100",5
[deleted],3
They passed up on 3 runs so far.  If MI lose by 3 runs remember that.,8
A free hit without drama ? That's so 2020,7
Fuck missed the full toss,3
Kuldeep is trying too many things I feel,1
Strategic timeout kills the momentum of the batsmen :(,13
claps sounding like a tadka on dal.,8
Okay so that's what it would've sounded like without the crowd noise,4
"Fellas, how's this Nikhil lad? Wondering why he's ahead of usual Rinku and Lad!",5
what an awful shot for a free hit,7
"Jeez Rohit, run",3
Noice,1
I like how Suryakumar goes aggressive against spinners,6
I feel everyone outside the stadium in their cars pull over everytime free hit siren goes out,7
"Brohit: Doubles is too middle class, let's hit sixes.",10
"Minimum 200 from here, come on.",1
"Why is everyone laughing at Kuldeep, India literally banks on him in the middle overs when we play ODIs",15
Kuldeep needs that delivery minus the no ball,4
Really good come back from KKR here,6
So is 100 on the cards I will not jinx it by mentioning players name.,10
"Oh baz, he looks to be hit hard by the bio bubble.",5
Missed two full toss!! You don't see that often.,8
anybody knows where I can get chicago bulls jersey in India?,2
Why Padikkal didn't play in U19 WC?,3

Why cummins  for 15cr again ?,7

I'd be frankly surprised if Rohit gave me investment advice in real life,3
KKR spinners slowing down the momentum,1
I think MI will win this one but if not then KKR will take the 2 points.,2
A man cried once more than a year ago and some shitheads still can't stop talking about it,5
"Kuldeep needs to toughen up mentally, He is a gun bowler but too fragile imo. Chahal shines under pressure. If Kuldeep had to play at Chinnaswami he would have retired by now lol.",5
"Last 26 balls, 36 runs",2
Rohit nonchalantly jogging to complete a run.,2
All dem players thicc,2
If Mumbai fuck up another good start I'll start turning off Mumbai's batting after 10th over.,3
Not trying to shame Narine but for my naked eye it does seem he chucks for few deliveries,1
Audience thought that went for a Four.,6
[deleted],5
"My problem with DK is that he lacks that killer instinct you need to win trophies. He takes it easy when he should be zeroing in on the right moments and gets hyper when bowlers need to do their own thing. Gambhir, Dhoni, Rohit, they all have this fire and hunger to win at all costs that helps them get the best out of their players.

It's only been half a match so far but KKR, like last year, feels like a collective of talented individuals rather than a winning team. You need a great captain to bring people together into a team and DK just isn't that.",-5
This is a big ground. Run ffs!,1
"Sale mote chakka maar ye tuk tuk kya kar raha hai!

Seeing McCullum suddenly makes me miss Adam Gilchrist and how he lead DC to win IPL few years ago,5
"Hardik next please, don't fuck around with thicc Tiwary.",8
"The fake crowd noise should be piped in by someone who's at the ground. Playing ""cheers"" for a single is so fucking stupid.",1
Ayy fuck this DJ. Just keep the ambient noise bhenchod,2
is rohit in pain?,1
"This DJ is the worst at fake crowd noises, a real crowd does not go berserk at a fucking single.",3
Fit India banner while Rohit's on screen lmao.,9
Yassssssss,2
Slow down is pointless against the spinners especially when u have Pandya and Pollard waiting.,3
This is classic us. Fizzling out after a good start just like last game. Hardik has his work cut out for him,7

Unnecessary,1
Why would you not make Morgan captain?,2
"That‚Äôs out, 100%",1
at the 16th over Rohit will eat SKY when hunger kicks in,-1
"Looked out. Not a good decision to run, bleh.",2
"This is where India lacks behind in T20s.

Fit India dialogue with Mr 36 inch chest. Can't wait.,12
Yeah ofc go to third umpire. When you are right in front but give a short run without a second thought,4

People were saying why they are not running 2s. Happy now fellas?,12

Ugh such a disapponting end,2
Bad calling. He was going so well. The slide to 160 has begun.,10
Suicide,3
160-170 loading,4
Stupid run,3
Morgan looks lost,3
Yep narine is fit,2
Should have been an easy two,2
Modi the lucky mascot for kkr,3
Classic MI,1
Y'all wanted 2s right?,2
Why not Pollard or Hardik????,6
"**10.5** Narine to Sharma, 1 run, OUT, skips down the track, Narine drags the length back, beats him in flight, and he drops this into the leg side **98-2**

SA Yadav run out (Narine/Morgan) 47 (28b 6x4 1x6) SR: 167.85",1
2 BIG TANKS IN THE MIDDLE.,2
Wait. You CAN'T break the stumps with the foot even if you have the ball in hand?,2
Yadav Gone Nice! I was getting really irritated with KKR‚Äôs bowling and the fucking crowd going crazy on the singles!,2
Why was this needed,2
That‚Äôs a serious pick up!,4
Name a better duo: Sharma and running out your partner,4
Thicc Bois in middle,5
Morgan is so calm. Should be the cap,2
Goddammit! Why's Tiwary out there now? Dude will halve our current run rate with his tuktuk,2
He had the ball but knocked the stumps with his elbow. Is that allowed?,1
A runout has to be the most frustrating way to get out for any batsmenüòì,3
Ohhhh shiiittt curvy boi Tiwary is here,2
Fatty is here lmao,5
"Ok if I have ball in hand and dislodge the bells with my foot, will it be considered out ?",1
Saurabh Tiwary over Pollard and pandya????,3
Mumbai gonna tumble to 160 now,-1
"Looking at the flip side, Rohit running out the team's number 3 batsman = double century confirmed.",9
"If you think SKY and Rohit were running badly. The next batsman is Saurabh Tiwary.

They would easily convert 3's into 1's",6
lmao graeme,1
"It‚Äôs Over 11 . Just get in pandya or pollard already . 
Why tiwary?",2
It was very easy to fuck that run out up good on Morgan for not doing that.,2
Saurabh tiwary now looks like a Tollywood villian,7
Why does the Hindi commentators sound like fake news anchors trying to hype a ridiculous theory?,2
"Batsman clearly out

Third umpire: okay can you show me the opposite side onü§ë",2
Really want to see Hardik at 4,2
So much thiccness,2
Why not Pollard or hardik,1
I can feel the earth shake when that fatass Tiwari walks out. Oh God why do I have to endure watching unfit fucks roll around on the field trying to hit a 6 when AB and others in their 30s are so fit.,1
Tiwari looking like turtle lol,5
"Tata Sky users, English comm on which channel?",1
Is Saurabh Tiwary planning in a stint in Kabbadi or WWE?,7

They showed some FIT India promotion and now Tiwary and Rohit are at the crease,5
Highest partnership in the history of the IPL by weight between Sharma and Fatty Tiwari.,0
One day this DJ is gonna give an interview saying how he kept the tv audience glued to their seat with his mixing in IPL and that without him it would have made the ipl disaster,1
"They are struggling to score against spinners, Hardik is obvious promotion here.",6
Is Dr. Hathi batting in GPL rn?,2
My god how is that fat a man allowed to play cricket,3
Y'all should know what mode Brohit goes to after he takes a Runout as sacrifice.,17

Tiwary to go after narine and kuldeep?,1
"Ah Tiwary in , now it's difficult to differentiate Rohit and tiwary when not batting",0
Pandya + Sharma = Tiwary,3
Sending Tiwary when you have Hardik and Pollard,3
Tiwary's favourite footballer is Eden Hazard,1
"Should have sent Pollard, why is Higuain here?",1
That's not Tiwary. That's just Ambani's son pretending to be Tiwary.,9
Now bowl Nitish Rana,3
Tiwary is there so Rohit doesn't have to run 3s in the second half of the innings,3
"SKY used to be the main man for KKR under crisis untill one of Uthappa or GG found thier form the season and was used lower down. In MI he's been opening or either at 3 which has given him his best 3 seasons as well!

Rayudu used to be MI's floater from the time they even had Tiwary! He used to play the finisher and Anchor when they asked him to but I love how CSK got the best out of him at the top of the order.

Both these two did an unthankable role for their previous franchises and it's wholesome to see them being rewarded for it!",5
Saurav looks like 92 wc inzi,4
Partnership of ponch,2
Almost anytime expecting fat loss ad on my screen,3

This duo epitomizes the thiccness that is Memebai Chonkians!,2

Man that was cringe,7
Buffalo Tiwari,-3
"Rohit panting with his mouth open now, talent needs to hit gym asap.",2
Tiwari is out of the team if he doesnt perform today. Ishan Kishan surely mustve learned to not be reckless over the quarantine,1
Tiwary has the face of a schoolboy and the body of a middle aged Indian unkil,6
tf was that Dream xi fans..?,1
"The crowd cheering noise is so fake lol, or am I imagining stuff?",1
Imagine being Rohit and and still not being the fattest person in a team of professional athletes,4
These two batsmen will convert 3's to 2's and 2's to 1's,3
Don't jinx it Harsha,3
Watch tiwary pull out a 'fuck r/cricket' innings.,8
These champion fans are inflicting physical pain upon me.,9
How do you not send Hardik or pollard against the spinners man,2
Who the fuck behaves like that watching cricket? I'm plonked on my bed shitposting on reddit,12
DREAM XI Employees Cringe XI,4
how much are these champion fans paid? even if i was paid 1 crore i wouldnt make a shame of myself on live tele,5
Match has slowed down seriously.,4
Saurabh Tiwary is in the team so Rohit can look fitter in comparison.,20
"Slightly bigger now

Gotta love harsha",5
I wouldn't murder anyone even for a million dollars except these retarded dream 11 dancing fans,20
Nice FIT INDIA. timing can't be anymore good,11
Should've sent a right hander..why is Pollard batting so low,2
Saurabh did NOT want to run that 2,2
"These two are taking us through to lunch after that dismissal, time to consolidate.",2
GG Rohit.,1
"Not surprised to see these absolute units in mota bhai's team. 

I'll show myself out.",5
"Mumbai Indians think , 30 (12) from guys like Pollard or hardik, why can't they think 70 (30) kind of innings ?",2
This is why you always run the first one hard,1
Genuine question: Why has Ishan Kishan been left out?,4
"Good innings Rohit, we wanr to see Brohit. Unleash him pls",2
S Tiwary caught at long on incoming,3
Who thought it would be a good idea to show those Dream 11 ‚Äòfans‚Äô doing whatever the fuck they were,6

No boundaries for 24 balls now,1
Rohit was striking at 150 at a point. I don't understand any of this,2
Pandya aaj ~~karke ayega~~ aake karega,4
I think Tiwari has kidnapped Rohit or Ambani's family to get a spot ahead of many batsmen in the squad.,3
Are biceps of any use while batting? Hardik looks so thin but is powerful af,3
"Those late af crowd noises are annoying.

Press the damn button on time. Ugh.",4
"If Morgan was captain they wouldn't be in this mess.

How are Banton's drink carrying skills?",5
[deleted],-2
I would stop being friends with a person who acts like that while watching a cricket match.,3
I think thanks to global warming the middle east has grown hotter since the eighties when cricket used to be played in Sharjah. I think its become so hot that we won't see a lot of batsmen able to stick around beyond 30-40 runs. Even the young'n paddikal got exhausted yesterday.,0
This is Hitman's 37th IPL fifty.,3
"Tiwary tried putting a slip saying, ""yeah r/cricket talk nah"" in his pocket but his trousers were too tight. What a shame.",1
Ipl has brought a lot of meaning to empty lives,6
"Mi is playing w 12 men. No, not the umpire. Tiwary counts as 2.",5
Fuck right left combination. Mumbai missed the trick by not sending pandu or Pollard,3
Can I sanitize my hands with Harpic ?,8

Why isnt bumrah padded up tf,5
"Rohit striking at 130, unless he shifts gears in next two overs ..not good enough. Saying that because tiwari isn't striking at 160 either.",3
Should've send Pollard up the order.,3
Fake audience sounds are killer man . They go  so loud even for 1's and it SUCKS. don't ruin boundaries by this,5

"Hope dk finishes kuldeep's quota, and hope warrier + russell (3+1) is the 5th bowler quota done..",3
Can someone tell me the commentators on hotstar? I've heard that guy but can't seem to remember his name,2
Oh now I understand why Tiwari is in MI. It's Rhyno conservation awareness.,13

Don't think IPL teams should promote unfit local players regardless of how good they are. Leaves a bad precedent.,-1
If these two manage to run a 3 I will donate $50 to a charity of you guys suggest.,41
Warrier looks like an indian Donald Glover,1
Both brothers padded up.,2

Emiway Bantai being played in stadium hh,2
What was that ball?,2
Bring back Nagarkoti or Krishna ffs,2
Should have sent Hardik over Tiwary,8
How much wide wil he bowl??,3
"Krunal looks like he is annoyed as hell with Hardik‚Äôs blabbering and just wanna smack him but can‚Äôt because of mom, so just sitting there with head down.",6

Yes warrier. Rohit can't play mid paced half trackers,3
"The dugout edit: IN HOTSTAR is real innovation in the IPL.. makes me feel like Indians CAN actually innovate -- unless they copied it from some other sport of course, but still they get credit for picking up a good idea and doing something for the TV spectators.

That was not wide fuckers,1

Saurabh tiwary cannot get a wide for a ball bowled to his offside,1
Mi brought in Tuk tuks over their power hitters,2
Tiwary obviously has no plan to play at international level. There is no way he can pass the fitness test and he isn't Brohit to get special treatment.,17

Bruh who was DK talking to tamil in?,2
"Just get rid of the free hit. It's too harsh a penalty for a minor involuntary transgression by the bowler. Along with that please remove the stratetegic timeout. All it does is obstruct the flow of the game. I know IPL is a highly commercialised prodcuct and they will show ads whenever possible but there are enough interruptions in the game to show ads. 

Instead of 20 overs a side I think they should play 21 overs a side. I don't know why but 21 is a better number.",-11
Is it me or does the game seem awfully slow today?,6
"Pollard should come next, if a wicket goes down soon",3
Fit India ad when Rohit and Saurabh are on crease is peak unintentional bantz.,7

Good thing these two are running slowly else the desert below will shift a mile.,3
"Here's why Tiwary being unfit is a problem. It shows he's not giving it 100%. Super unfair to those out there working their ass off for a place in these teams. I'm sorry but when you're playing a sport at a high-end level, you've got to maintain fitness, it's literally your job.",12
Wish we could have flairs of two teams. I like both RR and SRH.,2
Instead of 20 overs a side I think they should play ~~21~~ 250 overs a side. Not sure why but it's a better number.,1
Whats the point of establishing a platform to attack and sending Tiwari,7
Wallop,1
Did KKR sell Lynn just to open Gill with Narine?,3

MI had yuvi expectations from Tiwari but they're getting Misbah ul haq in return,1
"Rohit basically playing Cricket 19, pouncing on every pull opportunity",3
Rohit looks like he's about to become a father,-1
Tiwari should be playin aggressively while Rohit bats through the innings. Hardik and pollard are yet to come and they can drastically increase the run rate,6
feels really weird to think that cost of Cummins' single delivery in this IPL equals my annual pay,9
yall see kuldeep coming back to blue jersey?,5
Fatboy power,2
Tiwary doesn't need to hit now. Just give strike to Rohit,4
Rohit 100?,1
Cummins playing as a specialist batsman. Narine and Cummins to open the innigs for KKR,11

Have they changed the crowd so it's almost silent and then suddenly hell loud when they hit it? Sounds like a goddamn video game,6
Thicc boi Rohit on fire!,1
Kuldeep looks like past.,1
DK is a mediocre captain,2
Rohit on for a hundred here,5
Have some mercy on your teammate Rohit,4
Brohit on 69,4
How does Rohit hit sixes so easily when he's not really that fit and then there's Virat who's got so lean and shredded with the biceps and all..I mean look at the amount of energy they put into the shot too!,24
Looks like Mumbai has brought in the heavy hitters!,10
Does KKR have any other spinners on the bench?,6
Mf Kuldeep talked all sorts of crap in lockdown about gaining confidence and shit... and comes out with this lol,9

"Hahaha just noticed Mumbai are sponsored by dairy milk, seems appropriate with these 2 rotund fellas at the crease",2

Rohit would be walking these singles if he could,3

"no need to be so angry on tiwari, the guy is trying to take singles and give strike to rohit and the mans doing his job",9
"Just like Dhoni motivating Faf yesterday

Tiwari doing it for Rohit",6
Watching Rohit's belly jiggle and ripple in slow when he hits a six is getting to me too much for me.,30
"Rohit is the ideal male body.  You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.",97
With Dhoni not longer around. I don't see Kuldeep in our limited overs set-up for very long. His confidence is down. Gambhir handled him really well. He needs a good captain.,6
That Engage ad is just trash.,3
In literally every season there is 1 game where Rohit smashes up KKR and gets atleast 50 against them,3
Kuldeep's form really nosedived!!,1
rohit to tiwary: Oh maar le bhai,2
The beauty of big grounds. You need the footwork to hit sixes.,2

I hope KKR would make the simple decision of batting Russell at 4. You give him enough balls instead of wasting him down the order, you can reach reach the moon. Tooooo explosively consistent to be coming out to bat with like 5 overs left.

They have enough batting strength to do well if he happens to get out cheaply with a few  overs left so there is no risk. I feel teams play too ridgedly with their big hitters who they have labeled as pure finishers in their head. Especially when they are in great form like he was last year.",3

"Is there anything for the bowlers on the pitch? What is this? A road? Not a KKR fan, But you just have to feel for the bowlers. There's nothing much they can do.",4
Both these dudes can‚Äôt run between the wickets at all. Tiwary should hit boundaries or get out while trying. 5 overs is just enough for hardik and pollard to make a difference,1
Only people who don't know Suarbah Tiwary are surprised by Saurabh Tiwary,5

Cummins has a fundamental issue I think he finds it difficult to bowl fuller,4
"Pat ""15 crore"" Cummins with a economy of 15.",7
Worst part is that DK is not having conversations with bowlers,4
Imagine getting 2lakhs in bank account for every six you give .,2
I've got the song Urvashi stuck in my head for the past two days because of the stupid pharm easy ad,7
Talk r/Cricket talk nah,-9
Pandya party time now,2
Oh man Tiwary looks like snorlax,17
"Cummins has been in and out of Australia‚Äôs team so much that it‚Äôs hard to keep track of how he‚Äôs bowling.  
 
I thought he could bowl 145+ Yorkers like Rabada and hence the extreme price. Did he lose that ability or did he never have it?",1
15cr catch ladies and gentlemen,6
"Not bad from Tiwary tbf

170 strike rate was decent but dude really needs to focus on fitness",7
"Tiwari gone
Abhi to marna shuru kiya tha",2
Taking this wicket would be costly for KKR,4
What's with khatabook ads and that 'men' accent? Can someone tell me the origin of that accent? Is it nepali?,1
Anything under 210 would be dissapointing for MI,3
he did his job,4
Million dollar catch,1
Pandya or pollard now?,2
"An out of shape Saurabh Tiwari, last relevant a decade ago that too for his hair, is hitting Pat Cummins all over the ground.

I am done with 2020",18
"Decent Tiwari. That's pretty much what was required in Over 10-15, given our finishers do their job.",8
Even tho he didn‚Äôt execute it. I‚Äôm happy he made that shot. That‚Äôs what he is supposed to do,8
"Hmmm, talk now",1
Perfect time for Hardik to do the CT 2017 Pakistan knock again.,8
"Good job tiwary, you did your job",7
Cummins had the facial expression of existential dread as he was running in to bowl.,9
Hotstar comments are lowkey entertaining asl,8
That would've been a 6 in Sharjah,12
"No respite for KKR. Pandya, Pollard incoming ....",10
I'll remember that six Tiwari.,9
Welcome wicket for sure but not for KKR.,9
Tiwary looks like Krishanappa Gowtham was soaked in water overnight.,52
[deleted],19
Decent innings Tiwari,5
"**15.1** Narine to Tiwary, OUT,  **147-3**

SS Tiwary c Cummins b Narine 21 (13b 1x4 1x6) SR: 161.53",3
"Last ball of the over. Pandya and Pollard to come. 5 overs left. Its basically a free hit. 

Takes single. Gets out next ball. 

He did okay though, I guess.",9
Tiwary did his part. Little 20's to 30's from middle order at high strike rate is all  that is needed in T20.,11
"Revenge for Cummins, kinda",9
Tiwary did alright. Didn't waste any balls. Played one super shot.,11
"I'll be honest, Tiwary did his job there",7
Brett Lee wasn't that good at death iirc,6
The owners of the team that bid up Cummins till that range just for KKR to buy him will be having drinks rn,17
First game for Pat and folks here are already writing him off. What happened to our attention span?,12
3 million dollar long off fielder,9
I have no complaints from Tiwary,5
Tiwary did a good job. He is actually looking good and settled.,3
[deleted],14
Mumbai has some large lads.  Cricket is truly a sport for all shapes and sizes.,31
Cummins will go for 10 RPO in IPL and then will take 5 wickets every over against India in tests,71
Rohit and Tiwary built their shapes just to advertise for their sponsor - dairy milk,28
Guys are there any free streams for watching IPL matches?,1
Fuck if someone gave ME 15cr I'd be smiling from ear to ear no matter how many runs I gave!,8
Hard dick is in,0
"MI is such a balanced squad. For every big unit like Tiwari, Pollard they also have lanky Bois like Pandya Bros.",6
Who is that large black guy in the non playing staff of mumbai?,1
I don't think even Denesh Ramdin's mom remembers him as much as r/cricket match threads.,3
Hardhit üí™üí™üí™,3
"Rohit looks like he ate a bit too many vada pavs. 


Saurabh tiwari looks like he ate one too many Rohits",11
Surprising to see Cummins getting collared today.,5
[deleted],4
Is the purpose of that Whitehat Jr ad to turn people homicidal? I get this urge to strangle something.,11
"For IPL n00bs like me, this list of player prices is pretty interesting: https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/ipl-teams-and-squads

Pretty sure I could have spent 15.5 crore (for Cummins) more efficiently!",8
Hardik 2nd ball six? Or first?,6
Who tf is screaming Harpic,25
When will anil kapoor get over his 'dhina dhin dha' and 'what a playa' shenanigans? He's being milking it for so long,9
Rohit too thicc for double.,4
Lmaoooo Tiwary was like üòõ while hitting that. What a man,8
"Right 3 balls so 666 lads?
Edit: 66 surely edit^2: 6?
Edit^3: ffs pandya",2
When was rohit last IPL hundred???,5
Why is Kuldeep even an option for most important spinner lol? Gtfo of here,7
Tiwari has a huge tongue,6
"Hardik hit a dot ball. Super disappointed üò§üò§üò§

/s",9
tiwary did a good job considering MI paid 50 lakhs for him,9
Excellent spell from Narine,3
Narine fucking clutch üíØüíØüíØ,3
Great over,1
"Ian Bishop, Graeme Swann, Harsha Bhogle, Brian Lara, Scott Styris should be given the dugout setup and let them do proper commentary and analysis, without the cringe stuff.

Any additions?",4
Pat Cummins went for 15.5 cr so he decided to score 15 runs per over ...... in bowling,9
"Hardik ""MSD"" Pandya",4
Fuck bring back Tiwary,6
Drop Cummins for Chris Green üò≠,1
Excellent comeback from Narine. Brilliant,4
so hard for me to NOT read narine as nareen,6
Who‚Äôre the 45% who voted Kuldeep? Y‚Äôall tripping,17
Almost anticlimactic. Hardick walks in and does a Dhoni,5
[deleted],-10
Lmao if it was any other batsmen who would play 3 dots at this stage.... r/cricket would rip him a new one lol,25
Hardik wasting balls. Atleast Tiwari rotated strike,1
Narine has been carrying Kkr's bowling for years,3
"At least take a single my man, 4 dots is ridiculous",6
"Cadbury's should sponsor KKR, colour match",2
" The elevation Rohit gets & the ease with which he's able to clear the boundary playing the pull/hook is incredible. One in 5 pull/hooks is a six. Of the players to play 200+ pulls/hooks in T20s -  only Lewis (4.2), Russell (4.4) & Gayle (4.7) are more effective.    
CC: Thecricvizanalyst",3
Why hasn't Rana bowled?,1
"Dk gets too worked up. Cant handle pressure, we can see it on his face",1
Bowl full ffs,1
"We wasted a good start again, didn‚Äôt we?",2
Whats up with Pat's line,1
"Cummins' economy is the exact same as the amount (in crores) that KKR paid for him

Nice",2
15 crores,-1
Just because KKR paid 15 crs for Cummins. DK is making him bowl his 4 overs. Lol.. They have other options..,1
Lol thicc boi Chawla,0
Million Dollar Baby struggling massively here.,0
Bach gya rohit,2
Oh wow last year's hitting was incredible,2
Playing wicket maidens and 1 run overs is how you win IPL,2

Rohit is gassed now...,1

"25 of this over. Rohit is tired af, and just wants to have his Vadapav",0
"We put at least 10 or so runs on the table by not running. 

And that one time we ran... we got run out",4
that was a 2. FFS.,2
MI game -> plays kangana song. Peak trolling üòÅüòÅ,2
Rohit is tired!,1
Lost about 30 runs with abysmal running this innings,2
Fatty McFatfuck is already tired.,-5
"Ah yes, Jimmy Hoffa",1
200 still possible?,2
Dk is poor with field placements,2
Rohit should play anchor here and let Hardik and Keiron do the hitting.,5
Pandu what is you doing?,2
"DK shouldn't ball part timers now. Cummins with his half tracker dibbly dobblies won't help KKR right now.

Gotta get Nitish Rana in now.",2
"r/cricket: BRING IN HARDIK, WHY TIWARI, SPINNERS ARE THERE.

Hardik: 0 (4)",5
"This 15 crore circle jerk is kinda irritating now, we get it",-2
Hardik is next msd....but not in his prime,-3
"Had they paid Cummins, say, half a crore, he'd be bowling the pants off Mumbai right now.",2
"**This sub before IPL began**: *Oh no* guys, let's agree not to mock any players, it's only that cesspool of social media they call Twitter and IG where these things occur


**This sub now**: lololololol ultra thicc vada pav man can't run a double, GET OFFF YOUR ASS YOU FUCK, *anyway*, upvotes to the right",59
I feel we won't finish well today,4
What‚Äôs going on with Hardik?,2
[Well ofcourse there's a Jofra tweet for it](https://twitter.com/JofraArcher/status/403283885049778176?s=19),4
Rohit wants strike,1
Hardik what are you doing ...... 1/5 is pathetic. Just get out already so that Pollard can come in and smash.,1
Sunil Narayan FFS.,1

can we even get to 180?,3
Little sad seeing Rohit run like this,5
Rohit injured,0
Someone get Rohit on a diet. This dude is the worlds best ODI opener and is slow running the wickets while carrying a small paunch. It‚Äôs not excusable.,2
"Looking good for 220, and now we‚Äôre barely gonna crawl to 180",1
Jesus fucking christ Cummins.,6
Fit India,4
They should keep playing Kangana songs whenever MI hits boundaries and gets wickets for peak trolling üòÇüòÇ,3
Refreshing to hear Harsha's voice in comm box. Life is good again,6
Lmao FIT India dialogue,3
"Rohit becoming Gayle. Can smash it and is an incredible hitter, just wont run. Wonder how he‚Äôd go in the tests next Aussie summer",3
Why was Cummins not given 1st over?,5
Need 6 more to balance the books,1
16 overs without vada pav can do that to your body,2
Rohit : *wheezes and hits a 6* Ok stop running now,5
Why is Cummins still bowling short,5
"Cummins looks clueless here, bowling way too short",3
 nightmare continues for Cummo,4
Sad SRK noises,3
my fuckboy,3
"Pat Cummins wants to anyhow give 15 runs per over so if MI doesn't score he will bowl wides

Got to maintain the consistency",3
That line and length is gonna get him smacked. At least try 2 yorkers an over.,3
"If Cummins were to test Positive for Covid, would KKR still have to pay him",4
KKR jersey would be a good buy if not for an underwear logo on the chest.,7
You know what a tired Rohit does.,4
" ""Rohit Sharma converting 3s to 2s and 2s to 1s."" -- And 0s to 6s """,17
I think Morgan should have been the captain for KKR.,3
How many of these top buys have performed well?,2
I love Pandya,1
Ye choti wala kaun hai?,3
Hardik Pandya u sexy man!,2

Sheldon Soldier Cottrell>Pat Cummins,6
Fuck me Pat what‚Äôs going on?,3
LMAO gets hit for 4 and bowls the exact same ball again and gets hit for 4*,3
"Why are you bowling short to Pandya, Cummins?",3
HARDHIT üí™üí™üí™ MY BOY üí™üí™üí™,2
I sympathize with Cummins too binga,2
What is Cummins doing here ?,7
Fit India being endorsed by our curvy modiji. Might as well bring brohit on the team,2
And again! Bowl some yorkers cummins,3
I feel like Warner and Smith are the only Australian players who take the IPL seriously.,18
That‚Äôs my boi Pandya bhenchods!,2
Australian length‚Ñ¢,2
"15, 15, 13*

Another 15 coming?",4
Pat Cummins graduating from Dinda academy,12
Pat Cummins Welcome to Dinda Academy,2
Surely you go to Warrier for the other over from this end? Can't possibly do worse than Cummins,1
Harsha! A true centrist.,5
Fuck watching hardik play is so satisfying,1
"So apart from paying 15.5 crore for Cummins, KKR are using him at the death? What the fuck lmao have they EVER seen him bowl?",8
" Rohit, Tiwary and Pollard all over 200 pounds. Now we know why they say Duniya Hila Denge",10
Why the fuck is there a Modi ad in the middle of the over?,7
When is the last time a player who has the highest auction price tag performed well?,18
Hey Cummins..it is legal to land the ball after the half-pitch mark .,5
Pressure of money eeh,1
Dk couldn't use cummins wisely.. Poor captaincy,5
Dinda academy has a new professor,5
Did Rohit teach him that. Amazing Pull shots from Pandya,7
Cummins is absolutely fried. Doesn‚Äôt even look close to a wicket,10
Poor Cummo,3
Cummins will get to his 50 on debut,2
Why is there no fielder there lmaooo,2
Omg someone stop cum daddy from bowling what has gotten into him,2
LORD CUMMINS!,3
[deleted],8
"MI will be disappointed if they don't reach 200. With Rohit and Hardik in middle, 40 from here are minimum.",3
Cummins was picked on his name. He‚Äôs not a t20 bowler. Shit pick:,37
"Archer is an excellent T20 bowler and hence worth every penny. Cummins, probably worth 4 Crore at most.",18
Australian Umesh Yadav üòÇüòÇüòÇ,38
"As much as I like Cummins, he has a lot of work to do as a limited overs bowlers to be threatening. All he bowls is Test match lengths.",17
Why is Cummins bowling that length? Has he forgotten his yorkers?,7
"If they wanted a death bowler, they bought the wrong guy. Idk what they're thinking giving him 3 death overs",7
whats a dinda academy,8
Oh I just realised theres a white umpire today,0
Unsold Mark Wood > Lord Cummins Even Morgan knows,10
Morgan to Cummins : Bowl like this next time you are in England.. please,12
"Ahhh Patty, test bowling strategies don't work in T20 where everyone is looking to attack the ball",9
Cummins bowling like dinda used to,2
Cummins is bowling trash,2
Cummins loves bowling Short.,1
Hardik coming for you haters,0
Million dollar baby,6
Well deserved 50 for Cummins coming with all those pies,13
[deleted],-5
Why are you bowling each and every bal short?,5
This Cummings guy sucks,3
"Cummins is simply not a death bowler. He has to bowl all 4 in the start and the middle overs, maybe save one for the end max",7
Extraordinary hit is an understatement.,3
"What a six by Pandya, the man smoked that for fun",2
Love watching Hardik hit anything to leg side,3
Limited overs are ruining Pat. Change my mind.,5
Pat dinda cummins,3
What a player,1
Cummins looks lost.. have no idea what and how he is bowling.. maybe it's the heat which got to him.,4
That was Beautiful :'),2
My god 3 overs 50. Feel bad for Pat.,2
"Bruh, Pat Cummins was the last bowler I expected would join up with Dinda Academy",13
Lmao,1
Too predictable by Cummins. Too easy for Pandya.,5
I am glad RCB didn't bought Cummins,5
Brainless. Fucking brainless,2
worried for warrier's last over,3
Honorary degree from RCB bowling academy for Pat Cummins.,6
15 crores is too much me thinks!,4
"3 overs 49 runs for Cummins   
dreadful debut",5
Pandya showin his daddy power,2
"Ahahaha

Imagine paying 15 crores for this",3
[deleted],4
You can clearly see the ego there.,3
Cummins academy doesn't have the correct ring to it.,2
I cummed,2
r/cricket on suicide watch.,2
Pat Cummings has checked out.,2
did they change management at KKR recently,1
whos the indian dude sitting next to Baz Mcullum?,2
And Cummins approaches Fifty,1
Australian cricket board needs to rethink the T20 training and experience that its giving to its players.,2
Ofcourse Hardik Pandya is the one to take us past *69* sixes in the IPL.,4
"Short 4 
Short 4 
Short dot
Short 6 

Keep bowling short",4
Does Cummins only know short length?,4
"Cummings has shat the bed here.

Same short ball on middle stump. Same result.",3
I can‚Äôt wait to see Warrier go for 40 in one over,3
Pandya aaj karke aayega,2
Cummins got the price tag when he was performing so well in all three formats. Post that he has fizzled out a bit.,1
"For Cummins to be a top T20 bowler, he has to add a lot of variations to his deliveries. Right now, he just seems to be bowling back of a length hit-me deliveries. He's definitely missing cutters, yorkers, slower ones.",6
15cr in action,2
"I hate to bring back the cliche...

But should we induct Cummins in the Dinda Academy yet ? No ? Ok",11
Nothing wrong with getting it in the hole,3
is anyone elses hotstar shitting the bed? It doesnt load when using the web app and dugout doesnt work on android,1
These iPhone ads make me want a new one so much.,2
Only thing comforting for kkr fans would be that their star studded batting can chase it,2
"Are the pies bowled by Cummins called ""Cumpies""?",6
Idk why but seeing cummins make me sad,2
Cummins looks traumatised,3
Joy Bhattacharya wouldn't have let KKR buy Cummins for 15 cr.,4
"Rabada - 4 cr

Archer - 8cr

They must demand a raise.",23
"I think it‚Äôs only fair that as compensation for one Aussie bowling like shite, KKR let Pattinson take 7 or 8",5
I was expecting many things but not this when we signed on Cummins.,4
no more log cabins,12
All six ball with poor lines,6
I think noone's guiding Pat what to do,2
Everyone could sense Pandya was waiting for a short ball and cummo lad gives it to him on a plate,6
Even Lord Umesh didn't bowl this bad. We might be having a new lord here.,9
This is honestly not surprising from Cummins. I saw him do the exact same thing to Stokes at Headingley,9
"""Pandya hitting me in the same area? Let me feed him a couple more balls so that he can get a few more runs, **at the same spot**!""",6
"Welcome back to IPL, Pat Cummins.",4
Money Heist,3
Cummins giving more than KKR bargained for. They asked for 15 rpo for ‚Çπ15 crores. Now he is giving them extra runs. Such sportsmanship much wow.,3
Patrick dinda,1
"Big fan of bowlers getting smashed and refusing to adjust, 49 off 18, ooof",3
Cummins is just an Aussie Unadkat,0
"Don't stress guys, had to expect this the second he cost that much",3
Cummins is the new Unadkat,3
"As BCCI president, should Ganguly be doing the ads of My dream circle or whatever it was?",4
"Dinda to Cummins: Aur bhai aa gaya swaad

T: How you feeling in my shoes?",0
Lol Cummins,2
Dinda would have cost 1/10 the price for that economy,5
Russell or Cummins for 19th over,1
"Where is today's 30 runs over?

I feel it coming up.",2
Missed watched hardik do this,3
Pat Cummins in touching distance of Legend Lungi N,5
Now KKR will understand RCB's pain. When your costliest buy turns out to be out of form.,4
wtf was that?,3
Wonder why they haven't bowled Russel,1
Fuck I just realized that Hotstar has added commercials to the Dugout stream... FUCK HOTSTAR assholes,3
Did that land on the pitch ? Magi trying slower one.,3
"Smart from Mavi

Can't be hit for six if it's a huge wide",6
Lockie Ferguson is a better T20 bowler,4
I'm not gay but I don't want to live in a log cabin in the woods with cummo,7
KKR are fucked arent they,2
Wow Mavi that's the way I bowl.,5
Dinda must be patting pat after his today's performance,3
Bowling too funny for a player of worldclass standard,3
That was only 69m? and it cleared comfortably. How short are these boundaries?,2
Lmao no 1 test getting rekt.,3
Cummins joining Kulya in my list of bowlers that make me cry every time they start crying after getting whacked round the park,7
"Dk is pissed with the bowlers,  hence not talking to them",6
Even Umesh Yadav had better figures,5
What on earth was that ball,2
Imagine paying like 160 millions INR for someone who won't even bowl a yorker at death.,5
Village bowling,2
Turning on the TV to see Cummins bowling getting spanked all over  üòç,8
"is it me or does Mavi look Sri Lankan, like a cross between Kusal Perera and Kulasekera",4
11 extras,3
That ball did not even land on the pitch,3
Feeling bad for Cummins now,2
I feel Cummins would've fared better in India. The relative diversity in conditions would've helped too.,2
Pity that guy like Pandya gets 4 overs to bat and tuk tuk guy s come ahead of him.,2
DRAMA,2
Lockie ferguson> pat Cummins in t20‚Äôs,5
Should get 2 runs for that,1
Cummins justs want to spend a few days at Dinda Academy and learn from the best.,5
"What did they give, wide?",0
Can rohit make 100 today ?,0
"Mavi showing Mavi way to bowl   
learn cummins   
fucking adjust and adapt quickly",-1
This is sorta stuff i bowl in turf cricket.,2
Amazing bowling right now,1
Bruh this is just trash bowling,1
Just please send Pollard next.,1
Cummins becomes the first 2020 Australian graduate of dinda pacer academy.,2
Now that's good umpiring.,1
Where the fuck is Eoin Morgan??,4
Rcb fans can have a breather rn bc they were on the verge of buying another Lord Umesh,8
Pat Cummins nearing fastest fifty this IPL,8
Wonder if Cummins will have a chance to get to 50,7
How probable it is that dhoni becomes an umpire after retirement?,1
"Rohit is tired af. He did the good work, should retire hurt now",4
Keep bowling short guys,8
"Wtf kkr , yor guys shit or playing 4D chess",5
Where are the fielders,3
It's a six and half in Sharjah,3
KKR bowling short.. and short.. and short.. someone tell them about Yorkers..,1
people getting angry with cummins meanwhile rcb has atleast one bowler like this every year for a decade now,3
"I haven't seen Cummins Bowl this bad. I don't care about the runs, he isn't even trying to bowl anything other than the short ball",2
"KKR should just play the four Indian horsemen of apocalypse in Prasidh, Warrier, Mavi, and Nagarkoti and get Banton as the fourth overseas player.",3
Who's KKR captain? Please don't tell me it's still kartik.,3
Anyone remember KRR buying Shane Bond for 1M and giving him only 2 games ?,2
"Bowlers aren't dumb to continuously bowl short...must have been a pre discussed tactic...seeing the pitch, analysing the opposition... clearly it didn't work...that's where a captain needs to go to plan B...DK doesn't seem to care",5
"Chawla, Ngidi, and Umesh: welcome to the party, patty.",3
Brohit gonna hit 100 today. Maybe in this over itself.,1
I want it. I want 1 and 0 and 0.,1
They may have to bring Ferguson in also this attack is toothless,1
Who‚Äôs the bowling coach of KKR?,1
"What's this short shit?

The pitch is slow-ish, the ball's literally just sitting up to be spanked

Fielders down the ground and bowl yorkers",3
"Omg KKR, stop bowling short ffs",2
What's this field placement if you're bowling that line,1
"When you have one of the best captains right now in the world in your team, it makes sense to make him captain of the team.",1
"Fuck, I‚Äôve been watching Cricket for so many years now and there are still some new rules that I learn every once in a while.",5
Should have made Rohit my captain. Hope Russel plays well.,4
How many times does Rohit have to whack you before you learn not bowl short to him ?,7
Rohit looks exhausted.,1
Mavi was better than all bowlers for KKR despite being young and under pressure. He's good,1
Rohit looking to make the first 100 of this IPL? MI looking well set to get 210+,1
give da man a vada pao,3
You just cannot bowl short to Rohit. It never has been his weakness,3
KKR's death bowling is super fucked,2
Bring on death over specialist russell,1
"""He's getting all his _weight_ into that shot.""

Commentator knows what she's doing.",2
Most boundaries are pull shots but there is no fileder for catching the mishit.,2
"We are shit, aren't we?",5
Bowling short ball to the best pull short player. Great thinking,1
Haven't seen a single slower ball,1
Morgan should be captain,2
Already Morgan talking to the bowler instead of DK lol,4
That wasn't a wide,3
Have to be fuller to be bowling that line,2
"This is gonna be harsh but it's true.  
Cummins plays 12 matches this ipl
He got payed about 16 crores
Let's say he got picked 75% for his bowling ability and 25% for his batting ability
16*0.75=12cr
That's 12/12 = 1cr for his bowling alone every match.
If he bowls 24 balls per match
100/24 ~ 4.15 lakhs per ball he bowls in the ipl.
That's 5550 USD per ball he bowls in the ipl

So he was paid 74.7 cr till now just so that concedes 49 runs in 3 overs.  
  
Of course, he might play 14 or more games so this might not be totally accurate",6
"Fuck off is that a wide

Rohit moved a mile across",7
This is not wide,9
"Where do the Indian pacers learn the art of ""dishing out a hit me anywhere delivery every over"" ?",6
[removed],10
"Dew already ,MI is fucked",2
Lol the ball was sooo fucking wide,5
Whatttt the fuck,2
And this night gets weirder and weirder for KKR,4
Umpires are blind.,3
S Ravi has been fully paid by the boss,4
"It literally went under the middle of rohit's bat

Shit call",7
Lol..Rohit toying with Mavi,3
How‚Äôs that a fucking wide,2
Harsh to give wide,2
Awful bowling this over so far,5
"Pat Cummins was giving away 74s and 60+ runs in the ODIS vs England, hes clearly not in the best form",8
200+ will be very difficult looking at KKR's batting lineup,3
"Mavi really knows how to keep Rohit quiet here, wides after all can‚Äôt go for 6",3
"DK: Don't bowl short to Brohit

Dinda Bowlers: Short bowling ... OK got it.

DK: .....",11
That‚Äôs wide,6
that's surely not wide,-1
Morgan would be slowing the game down now if this was a T20i. Talking to the bowler between deliveries and trying to stop the momentum. Make him captain please KKR.,10
"Second year in a row KKRs bowling has been dog shite. They have a weak Indian core bar Gill, Karthik and Rana. There's no way they're making playoffs with this squad.
Unless of course Russell does his thing and Morgan joins the party.",6
That was not a wide tbh,1
N ppl say mi dont buy umpires,3
Dew is killing games here,3
No way that was wide,1
Rohit made the wide line his stumps and the ball is still wide.,2
How is it a wide?,0
Lmao Rohit wants to run and Hardik refuses. 2020 is strange.,8
Cummins looks out of ideas. He has one of the best bouncers and yorkers in the world. He just doesn't bowl them enough because the success he gets from good length balls in tests and odis. Get some clarity in your head and bowl your yorkers like Rabada does.,0
absolute village umpiring,2
Cmon KKR try not to conceed above 210 at least.,1
Is KKR trying one of those attack your opponents strength strategy against Rohit?,1
Hardik bro why,3
Where‚Äôs the dude who was arguing about no wrong calls going for Mumbai,1
"Rehendo Rohit bhaiya aapse na ho payega

T: Rohit mate you can't run the second",6
Just lie down for a while Rohit ! You are too tired.,6
The only time we ran 2 was when we were not supposed to,9
Lol Mavi doesn't wanna pitch it on the pitch.,3
"That wasn't a wide or was it!!

It is close call.",1
"I hope Cummins does better, much better in next match or is not a big social media user....",6
Lmao these fake Hardik chants,13
KKR really likes 8-9 ball overs,8
The reverse AB-Virat strategy. Converting 2s to 1s,35
Better 666,1
Cummins bowled worse than Umesh Yadav lmao,50
"Kkr also has 1 thicc (‚Ä¢ ,‚Ä¢)",2
Behenchod what the fuck is this,4
is HARDIK a variation of KARTIK,5
Hardik wants to score a century before rohit,3
Loving the chants from the crowd,13
"Since it's 2020, KKR & SRH going to be the meme team this season?",9
Hard dick! Hard dick! Hard dick!,11
Just because they have regular dinners at Antilla that doesn't mean umpires have been bought,11
Mavi looking the better bowler than Cummins.,17
Out!!,4
Fucking finally,3
"DK is not talking to the bowlers, which morgon does when he is the captain.",6
Letzoooo Mavi!!!,2
Not watched all matches of CPL but was russell bowling there regularly???? .... He doesn't look that fit,2
Would have been in second stand in Wankhede,5
"To all the dejected KKR fans, your batting line-up has the ability to make a joke out of any bowling lineup. The game ia not over yet.",17
Hardik is back to gully cricket.,1
Cummins brought in for being a specialist catcher,7
Mi just lost 20 runs,2
"Sharma status:

‚òëÔ∏è Brohit  
‚¨ú Nohit",18
Cummins should spend some time with Mavi in nets,4
[removed],6
Billion dollar fielderüòç,9
Rohit was out of gas. He was spent. That's why you need to be fit.,8
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè HITMAN,3
Budget panda or pollard,4
Hopefully this will prevent the push to 200,1
Aye so his job is to take catches. We were being hard on him for no reason. Silly us.,15
Full toss that should have been deposited,8
Pat Cummins gonna take lessons from Mavi tonight. The scenes,5
Pls dont let krunal bat,2
Give the 15 crores to Mavi instead.,7
Rohit has immense strength but low stamina,2
He was too tired he doesn't have the fitness,8
2 out of 2 catches for Cummins. Rare feat so far in this IPL.,12
Well played Rohit!,2
So happy for Mavi,6
Specialist Long off Fielder Patrick Cummins,24
"Thank you Rohit dada, ik you threw your wicket, our bowlers were no where near getting you out",8
"Oh look, a full delivery. Almost forgot what that looked like.",17
Wtf is this overrate,2
Good innings for the hitman,3
Why is Pandya batting above Pollard?,2
Mavi's been outstanding. Bowling tough overs in the power play and death.,3
Here comes the big man,6
That's where the fitness matters u can't get tired after playing 50-55 balls,11
"2 catches for cummins

Million dollar catches",15
"1 wide wrongly given and the comments start coming out 

""mUMbai BOuGht UmPirES""",12
Always a good sight when young Indian bowlers play well.,3
Professional fielder Cummins back at it again. Might end the season with a catch per crore. Worth it.,11
[removed],1
Brohit is back with a bang!,2
You need to be at Kohli's fitness level if you wanna score a century in UAE,9
"**17.5** Shivam Mavi to Sharma, OUT, Sharma has looked exhausted for a while now. Usually you would see such a full toss outside off disappear into the grand stand, but he ends up slogging this to long-on for an easy catch. Not the worst thing to happen for Mumbai **177-4**

RG Sharma c Cummins b Shivam Mavi 80 (54b 3x4 6x6) SR: 148.14",0
"Get fitter dude!!

Or won't pass YoYo test, don't want it to cause another controversy.",12
The entire match I saw Eoin advising the bowlers. Make him the captain you cowards,37
yesterday i posted about how i thought MSD looked very trim and today's post is that Brohit really doesn't,8
Rohit looked half dead in this over.,2
Mi should be aiming for 200 I recon.,1
190 not happening now,3
Rus Cummins or Warrier for 19th??,2
"I tuned in after he reached 73. Did he tire out or something, because he looked like shit the entire time I was watching",6
the only coding you should be doing at 13 is color-coding your school timetable,22
That sitter cost 15 crore for kkr,5
is that Capt Morgan I see,13
"Great innings by rohit, could have had more if he extended the 1s to 2s.",4
are they playing some arabic song at the stadium? into it.,4
Morgan basically acting as captain now talking to the bowler,12
"Cummins has contributed by taking some catches but 15mn for that   
Goodness me",3
I love how everyone has lost their shit because Cummins has had one bad game playing a tournament he doesn‚Äôt play. Dale Steyn is the best fast bowler of my time and he has been tonked on his bad days in the IPL as well. This sub is reactionary beyond.,6
The Big Dog is here.,2
People that can catch are like diamonds in these T20 leagues. Harder to come by than quality batsmen and bowlers,5
"Cummins earning fantasy points, well any contribution is better.",3
Big Daddy at the crease,2
I think Hardik makes up 2% of the mass of the entire MI team. Some thicc boys in here,12
These player chants are grade A cringe,5
We're right around the hardik Softdik line right now.,3
Any less than 6 boundaries in the rest of the innings I would be disappointed,2
what is this shit playing in thr background lol,4
Over rate too slow. Fire all the bowling coaches.,1
As a neutral you may find pollard exciting to watch but as a MI fan its very painful.,7
"They're gonna take over 2 hours to bowl 20 overs

Jfc that's an awful over rate",7
Fuck White Hat. Absolute scam. No way can kids do coding at that age.,16
Looks like Morgan is unofficially doing captain duties. Thank God!,5
Pat might not even bowl his entire spell,3
Why is Morgan not captain?,6
Why do I hear 'Po' Lund?,0
This is the third time in 17 IPL innings that Pat Cummins has conceded 40+ runs in one IPL game. His worst figures: 0/59 v MI in 2017.,6
What's the penalty for slow over rate ?,8
What song is playing?,2
Pollard is an absolute unit.,3
MI is wasting pandya and pollard by giving them 15-20 balls. Pandya should come at 4 and pollard at 5,7
Mavi bowling good today makes me happy,1
"If Sharma was fit , he would have scored 100",3
Inb4 the 4th time the last over goes for 30 runs,3
Ban this guy. Bowling yorkers and shit on a t20.,6
"This innings doesn't look like it will finish before 9:30 pl ist... That is more than 2 hours for an innings and I can't remember anyone getting injured or any sightscreen issues which might have added delays.

They have to start punishing teams for these...otherwise the matches which are supposed to be done in 3:30 hrs would start taking greater than 4 hours",2
"People talking about fitness, yeah he doesnt look that fit but do consider that UAE is really humid at this time.",2
Are there run penalties for a slow over rate? A 2 hour innings is ridiculous really,3
Russell or Pollard who is bigger ? Russell surely has more muscles...,5
Cummins shouldn't bowl after the 12th or 13th over,2
"What an over, brilliant stuff. If you try for the yorker and err and even bowl a low full toss, much tougher to hit with long straight boundaries compared to the short ball tactic. The square boundaries are 10m shorter. 

Should've done this much earlier",2
"If we can restrict them to 200. It should be good work.   
Dunno how easy it would be but we do have the batting to chase it down.",2
[deleted],10
1 more onslaught on Cummins remaining. Go Hardik and Pollard,1
This innings has been so slow there were fans in at the start,4
Russ to Pollard,2
Russel bowling to budget Russel,6
Is it me or the ad breaks are longer than usual?,3
Rohit was deemed as the anchor but was still able to hit 80 in 50 odd balls,5
Russell vs Hardik Just for the memes.,5
"Pollard is one of your main hitter and he gets 11 balls to bat ..
What's the strategy here ??",-1
3 west indians on the pitch rn,25
Even a single from Pollard got me like *woof*,2
"Lmao Dre Russ is like fck off Cummo, I'm unfit but I'm still gonna bowl",1
So Cummins won't bowl out,1
budget hardik bowling to hardik,5
There is 1 imposter among kkr bowlers,3
Lockie Ferguson .. Major miss,3
"hit them daddy, hit them hardd",1
Haha 15.5 crores won't even finish a 4-over spell.,4
Hardik Hit wicket WTF,7
Omg WHAT,2
Lol I love that all the Aussies and English people on this thread are using crores as a unit as well,12
Hardick got too hard lol,3
MI won't even make it to 200. What a shame ! They were looking like they will get way past in the 1st half of the innings,6
HAHAHAHAHA using the depth of the crease,3
Russell is pissed with the way he got the wicket.,8
Hit wicket? Lmao,3
Pandya used too much depth,5
Lmao Pandu,3
Softdik,10
Pandya Chutiya.,5
Lmao.. that was dumb hardik,6
"Hit wicket.

WTF.",6
Bruhhh pandya,6
LMFAO,7
"Damn, what even happened",3
Hardik Hardscomb,3
FREE WICKET,6
Talk about taking it Deep,12
What the hell was that,4
VILLAGE PANDYA,7
Chomu hardik,6
What an idiot,4
That was anticlimactic,13
F,7
No team would stick to pollard as much as MI would,6
"Mi has the heaviest batting order

On basis of weight",41
Lol Hardik Handscomb-Bairstow,6
Hardik didn't pull out his bat in time,9
Kyuuuuuunnnnnnn hardik kyuuuunnn,3
Lol,3
Wtf Hardik. Loss of 15-20 runs fo sure.,8
Oh man Harpic,3
Man. That sucks,6
[deleted],7
Hahah expected. Hardik bats so deep in the crease,5
omfg what was that,4
hardick......sigh!!!!,1
Gully cricket,1
Cue curb your enthusiasm theme.,3
Broadcasters too busy sucking off Pollard to show that ball properly,3
Lol pandu,2
Most bizarre dismissal I have even seen.,1
Andre Russell : surprised Pikachu,3
Aaj main kar ke aya....wicket hi tod di Maine.,8
Hardik is such a meme haha,4
Okay fuckboi what even,7
How the fuck,2
There's a reason for the gap between the stumps and the crease hardik pandya.....,6
That is so unfortunate.  Isn't this the second time Hardik getting out this way?,3
Why the f are you laughing Panda ;(,1
Listening to Harsha is so soothing and even therapeutic for the PTSD that is KP and Sunny,5
LMAOOOOOOOO,2
"Neem ka patta khadwa hai, Hardik Pandya bhadwa hai

T: Hardik Pandya screwed that up",2
The fuck dude!!,5
"**18.3** Russell to HH Pandya, OUT, he is hit wicket **180-5**

HH Pandya hit wicket b Russell 18 (13b 2x4 1x6) SR: 138.46",2
That's village,2
Lmaooo,2
Ooof. That sucks,2
"Hehehe, I remember hitting my stumps to get out",2
Hahahahah each of Cummins balls were worth 6 lakhs today. Makes sense a lakh fir every run he conceded,4
Yeh aaj kya karke aya?,5
Fuckboi fucked up,2
LMAO Hardik,1
This is called Chewtiya Wicket.,1
Does Russell get the wicket for a hit wicket?,2
Dugout too embarrassed to look Hardik in the eye,3
Oh man my childhood memories of getting out by hit wicket. Proper village cricket.,3
Hardik you're supposed to late cut the ball not the bails,3
Even Russell looked confused,5
"Damn, the Select Dugout were just talking about this the whole time. And there he goes.",2
"After all the chad boasting, Hardik shows that he actually bats for the other team..",3
PandyaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,1
Lmao Russel is like free wicket? Thanks,1
Such high IQ play from Hardik.,3
Gotta get in Lynn to replace De Kock and Kishan to replace Tiwari.,5
"Ok Pandya, let‚Äôs see you laugh when you‚Äôre bowling to Dre Russ",6
Russell couldn't believe it lmao,7
Indian maxwell Pandya,5
weird time to get a ‚ÄúPandya Power is ON üí™üèº‚Äù notification from hotstar,8
Pandya competing with Maxwell in wrong stats.,3
Ahahaha what an idiot,3
"After little cricket for months, we get cricket on steroids, every possible scenario. Waiting for a Mankad.",5
Why the hell are you laughing Hardik,7
"""HOLY HICKKK""",2
Hardik declared to let his brother play,9
"Hardik aaj karke aya

Hit wicket",4
"If this match ends in a tie, I wanna see Pollard vs Russell WWE match as a tie-break.",18
Pandya out; pandya in,1
Will say it again. Cummins bowled that 3rd over only because he was bought for 15 crores. Piase wasool karne ke chakar Mein band baj gaya,2
Hardik gifted us a wicket lmao,1
"Lmao, i should just make the team I want to lose's players as captains in fantasy league, this kinda stuff always happens",4
"Yeh chutiya bhi abhi wicket pe padta, lol.",3
Looks like we really want to loose first 5 matches at UAE again.,5
"hard dick doing it for the memes

*the here we need but not deserve*",2
good job they changed the handball rule,1
Pollard really scampering for that quick single there. Respect the grind,3
Hardik doesn‚Äôt pull out in time,6
Wtf was Pollard thinking?,2
[Pandya right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jz1TjCphXE),1
Only Hardik could get out like that,2
Kungfu gandya,3
Time to let loose,2
Krunal bolstering his macho credentials by sending back the physio,9
Why is slow motion always so much funnier to watch,5
Almost another hit wicket,3
Haha shithousery again by MI,3
jeez didn't expected from Hardik at least,2
Imagine Krunal fell over onto the stumps now loool,8
Being too cocky with Cummins ah,3
Not sure why  Haedik is so happy,5
Village,3
Krunal can't play short ball..he should be expecting it every time he comes to bat,3
IPL is village af,7
Nearly two hit wickets in two balls,3
Scenes if Krunal had fallen on the stumps and bros ending up on hit-wickets,6
Lol would have been hilarious if Krunal also had fallen on his stumps,7
Jst get Russel a physio or two on retainer and spend the rest on a decent T20 bowler,6
Baccha hone ke baad pandya bechara kuch kar nahi paa raha. Every day is aaj karke nahi aaya day,3
Russell should've bowled in the death,2
Ugliest single of all time,2
Nearly two back to back Pandya hit wickets,3
Pandya will still think it looked cool.,5
[deleted],2
All that effort for a single from krunal :d,1
What a meme over,2
Who is this awful commentator? How bad is his voice?,0
"They'll say its a hit-wicket. But, Hardik bhai paying his homage to his idol,  is what I'd assume.",3
Krunal looking like Gulshan Grover lite in that pic,9
"lmao, that was some welcome",1
MI wants to beat the 15 crores out of pat Cummins today.,11
Do you guys think they would send Cummins in next?,2
Should be a decent score after the obligatory 30 off the final over,5
Krunal down on the pitch as if he's going to start a mujra dance anytime,3
"Hardik Pandya's dismissal was just the 11th instance of an IPL batsman dismissed hit wicket in more than 1500 innings.

Andre Russell becomes the first bowler since Sreesanth in 2008 to claim two hit wicket dismissals in the IPL.",18
That's a hilarious way to get out lmao,8
Tiwari had a better SR than Hardik,10
that was a good yorker length ball by Russell,2
"Other than the meaningless short deliveries to Rohit, Russell has bowled well, so far",6
Pollard was ambling to the other end in complete disregard of Sr. Pandya's fate,6
Ajay devgn w blonde hair is a sight to see. Like a real singham(lion),9
Hardik stop laughing man,7
Excellent,3
Russell is Cummings all along,6
What an over.,3
"MI not getting even 190, aren‚Äôt they?",2
Give half of that 15.5crs to Russel,18
"If cummins is 15 cr

Drerus deserves 50cr",8
Would have been pretty funny had K. Pandya hit stumps while falling.,6
Styris : Cummins the most expensive bowler in IPL History....I am talking financially,6
Damn beauty this over.,3
What a fking over. KKR is seriously nothing without Russel,5
4 runs from 19th over... excellent from Russell.,5
"Nearly knocked him back onto his stumps there, that might have been a first, both brothers out hit wicket to the same bowler.",5
4 run 19th over ?? Gonna sting later.,6
200 is still on with polly on pitch,4
Did I hear it right? Do they really put 24 carat gold stripe in MI shirt?,3
Brilliant over Dre. DK going to regret not bowling him more overs.,1
Get 200 man please,2
Watch and learn Cummins.,1
is it really necessary to spray everyone with oil? is this cricket or porn?,5
Pattinson is better with bat than Krunal,2
Russell is fucking MVP,2
Last year final was one of the most see saw matches ever,2
who is kkrs ngidi today?,5
Mumbai is definitely winning this right? Asking as a degenerate gambler,3
Dre russ bowls well. Better than bravo or pollard imo,4
Russell is like a tank,3
Seriously is any player good enough for this sub????,3
"I know the commentators talk him up a lot, but I have never rated Krunal Pandya's batting. It's okay at best. Had always struggled against good bowling.",7
Russell better bowler than Cummins lmao,6
"What an over by Russel. If you're bowling short at death, you gotta bowl like that",5
Should have gotten 200+ with the start. Sending Tiwary totally fucked up the momentum,2
MI haven't got it right with tiwary. Leaves too less bowls for hardik pollard and krunal,1
"YES, MAVI",2
What do you guys think about whitehat Jr lol,6
The over rate is so slow   IPL needs to fix this or they will go NHL route. With so much time being wasted,4
"Andre Russell has been out hit wicket twice in his career and got two batsmen out hit wicket. No other batsman has been involved in more than two hit wickets in T20.

Cc:cricviz",3
"**Most sixes hit by Rohit Sharma in an IPL innings**

6 - v KKR, today

6 - v KXIP, 2013",5
I am guessing 195,2
Off topic but Virat is the only cricketer who looks so natural doing an advertisement,4
15 crore only 3 overs....... Cummins charges 5crore per over,9
"Tell you what...Sthalekar, Isa and Mel Jones are pretty fun to listen to. I'd love to be there live when the three of them come on air together. Fucking love them all!",5

Cummins was robbed off a 50,20
few people who used oberoi to advertise: Financepeer and Modi,4
Aaj mein bail udake aya APNE,4
Hey it's honorary bangalore vs Bangalore tomorrow,8
Another poor finish for a below par score. Even year blues live on,3
Polly aunty lookin a lil extra thiccc ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) üí¶üí¶üí¶,2
I bet Ferguson replaces Cummins 1-2 games in the season. 150 kph would still offer something more than this dross.,7
If Nita ambani hugs harabhajan when they win she should slap pandya for this meme dismissal.,5
"Dre Rus is literally god for KKR. If he was only more fit, so that Kartik can bowl him more",5
"Virat and Rahul should switch teams, play for their hometowns",5

"Budget pandya isn‚Äôt going to hit 30 runs, I might as well go to sleep now",9
"Kuldeep's shitty form continues.

Really worried about him and what this IPL will do to his confidence when playing for India..",7
What happened to Nagarkoti?,3
Hope we get to see Pollard break into a brisk jog in this last over.,1
RCB are going to regret letting KL go,1
Spending all dat money and didnt even use all his available overs üò≥üò≥,1
Did kkr buy Morgan just cuz DK was too tired to run across all the time lol,7
Pattinson should have come in before this phoney.,0
In b4 a 7(7) for pollard,2
"Imagine being no 1 test bowler

You couldn't complete overs but a uncapped Indian bowler did",6
With Hardik 200 would have been possible ffs,1
Mavi is a treasure,1
Tommorrow Karnataka 11 against Banglore.,3
"If Russell goes big today, this 180 something is gonna look fucking easy",3
Kkr finally bringing it back,3
So Morgan is basically captaining bowlers now,9
"Mi looks like having top, middle and bottom heavy batting order.",2
"You can add another 15 runs to the target score, because of relatively larger grounds and the bounce and roll of the ball is a tad slower.",1
Aaj Pandya kar nahi paya.,2
190 toh banao pls,7
Make Morgan captain already,7
10 runs short here,5
Shivam mavi deserves 15 crores instead of pat,2
Every year the bowler who goes for 2 mil plus also goes for 10 rpo+,6
"Nice to see Mavi, why is prasidh not selected ahead of sandeep.",2
"Mavi doing things his way and that's Mavi way 

Learn dimwit Cummins",7
wholesome on how morgan is setting up field for mavi,4
"People criticising saurabh tiwary for no reason. Nobody has hit much after his wicket, and MI may not make a 200+ score",5
Mavi > A Tall Aussie Bloke,5
good comeback from kkr. MI are short of runs for sure.,3
How the hell did Krunal Pandya get a 140 SR,2
Is it one appeal per innings or game?,3
"I don't understand people talking shit on Cummins. He is a great player, we all know that. One bad day does not make a bad player.",3
Shit ending,6
MI fucked up were cruising till SKY got out,3
This over rate is too slow man my mum is shouting at me to come for dinner.,15
Did someone not tell them that this is a 20 pver Match? Wtf is this death batting,5
Nope. Not out.,2
DINESH REVIEW SYSTEM?,13
Out,0
Russell looks so normal sized in front of Pollard,8
So nice to see that in Mavi and Saini a new crop of Indian death bowlers are coming out,10
"Brett Lee is giving a shit ton of excuses for Cummins.

But common you have to take some personal responsiblity for some shocking bowling, absolutely dreadful.",12
Looks not out tbh,2
Ok. Firstly how the fuck is that wide?!,5
"Not everyone has Jofra 

*Flex flex flex*",13
Indian umpire saying rock and roll in a thick Indian accent doesn't have the same effect as my boi Marais saying rock and roll.,10
Every inning taking more than 2 hours is ko acceptable In any condition.... They need to speed up the over rate,4
That shouldn't be a wide,1
Why the fuck do umpires not go for ultra edge directly. Rock and roll my ass,23
‚ÄúRock and roll‚Äù,5
Why don‚Äôt they use hotspot anymore?,6
Lmao DK,1
DK cheating/s,2
Mavi really needs to work on wides,3
Too many extras this innings. Something to consider for KKR,3
No harm in reviewing with 4 balls left,4
Using up your review for that just because you're at the end of the innings. Captains should be fined for this stuff.,1
I do love me a bit of drs Rock n Roll,5
"Ultra edge like pat's bowling 

Flat",5
Why don't they use hotspot instead of ultra edge,3
I love Cummins and logcabin and all that but KKR definitely overspent on him.,9
"Third umpire: Never seen a flatter line than that one, Karthick. Cunt.",3
I saw a very small blip in the flat line,2
What is the point of front on cam when they are going to go to ultra edge 100% of the time regardless of how close or faraway the ball is,8
Does DK get banned for this overrate? Will the people get to see Morgan captain?,4
Dumb question are they changing the boundary lengths from match to match at all?,2
Wagon wheel wil have a thiccc line in that direction. Just put a fielder there,1
Finally a boundary,1
Use ultra edge and get done with it!!,2
I have no issues with the Pandyas milking the Ambanis.,6
What is ER? Cricbuzz keeps bringing it up,5
"I wonder if that review was done just to avoid the wide call, and get in the umpire's head not to call balls of that line wide.",4
I think Russell has opened up a way to control Pandya. Won't be standing this deep for long if other bowlers also start going around the wicket and get him to try cut or slash.,1
"Poor throw

Better throw and he's probably out",2
Incredible pace from the big man there. Love to see it,1
At least we hit 190,1
"Do third umpires use ""rock and roll"" with their wives too.",4
Budget Pandya cant hit. Better to hve Kieron at strike,1
For a fast bowler Warrier threw like a limpy limbed wimp there.,0
uncle polly to get MIndians around 200,1
Pollard has become thicc,4
What‚Äôs the role of krunal in this team? Guy can‚Äôt even bat or bowl?,8
Slow bouncers are very annoying. At least Yorkers are exciting to watch,1
I genuinly hate it if they are playing this crowd cheer to the players. Why the fuck does the bowling team need to hear cheers for the batsmen? Makes no sense.,7
OMG they need to stop commenting about how big Pollard is jeez.,16
"How good is Tom Banton tho? If Nagarkoti can cover for cummins, kkr can get a batsman in",7
"Last ball, just hit a Six now ffs",6
Quick gun Morgan,7
Kuldeep on long on while Pollard is batting ? Who tf is setting the field ?,10
"1 ball to go , don't mess it up , he's done good",3
Pollard should bat at 4 for mumbai. He has been in the team for so long and has played reliable innings before.,3
Needs a big dick show from Narine,2
"oh captain my captain, rise up and hear the bells",3
"Nice job by KKR at the death. MI will be kicking themselves. With their batting lineup, KKR favorites at the break",10
Morgan the defacto captain,8
Better open the batting with Cummins to try get their money's worth tonight...,46
morgan earning his paycheck there.,13
"6 foot under are manlets, you heard that?!?",1
DK needs to be banned for this terrible over rate.,6
take over morgan thats it,9
KKR with their batting would be ok with anything under 200,0
lol who is the captain? morgan or karthik?,9
Morgan might as well be the capitain. He is doing what a captain is supposed to do....communicate with the bowlers,20
Shit ending,4
"MI's short by about 25, considering the start they had. Still a pretty good score",8
195 is ok,3
Well bowled Mavi ..,3
2 hrs and 6 minutes for 20 overs. Pathetic.,14
Someone here predicted 195...damn,10
"Pollard didn't look in good touch, should have gotten 200",4
Morgan is basically the captain. Was even setting up the field and now speaking to the bowler.,25
Why does Mavi hate pitching it?,1
What an excellent final over by Mavi.,17
Should have put 210-215,4
KKR's Indian fielders are shit.,7
"To someone who knows this stuff, how is this score for the surface?",3
We are short by 10-20 runs,6
Kuldeep on long on. Russell in short 3rd man. Excellent fielding.,7
Commentators dusting all the King Kong jokes for pollard,2
Mumbai's bowling is too strong,2
Mi 25 short from where they cud reach at one point,3
"Typical MI.

Blazing start. Threaten to make 220. End up at 160 - 180. Bowlers bring it home.

Tbh I'll gladly take 195.",10
Not even 200. After that start.,2
Did the match start late today? Or they really took 2 hours to bowl 20 overs?,8
Last ball 140.3 km/h,1
Excellent death bowling by KKR.,1
Over 2 hours for a T20 innings? That's insane.,3
Good Job from Mavi. Now bring Gill for opening.,1
Decent comeback by KKR. The batting should firmly believe that they've got this.,3
Pollard should have been sent ahead of Hardik. He usually takes a while to get going.,2
"Mavi bowled much better than the experienced cummins today, tried bowling yorkers instead of the same length",3
"The late surge which never really came for MI ..
HAPPENS when you keep your hitters saved for 21st over.",1
DK really has to contribute with the bat. His captaincy is not enough to justify a spot,5
"Brett Lee when it comes to Cummins: Oh dear, oh dear, gorgeous!

Brett Lee when it comes to other death bowlers: You fucking donkey!",11
They might make morgan the captain midway through the season,7
Game on. I hope Krunal can still bowl,2
[deleted],3
Might as well announce Morgan as captain. Anyways a better decision than Karthik as cap.,8
After the start Mumbai I think you have to be slightly disappointed they didn‚Äôt get 200+ but it‚Äôs a very defendable score,4
Road of a wicket easy 400 score,7
"Overall score is really above par, but the momentum^(tm) is with kkr",2
Given the bowling attack mumbai has this is still a very difficult chase,10
Krunal is a poor pandya,1
"Ballsy too give bowling to inexperienced mavi, and kudos to him on keeping it tight.",7
"sending tiwari was a bad strategy. if they'd sent in pollard or pandya, they couldve used those overs to get settled and fired in the last few. rohit was already set on the other end.",1
"FUCK IT, WE WILL CHASE 196 AND WIN THIS GAME",2
ultra patriot Shri Shahrukh khan bought cummins knowing that he's a shit t20 bowler just to wear him out with extra workload and increase the chance of an injury so that he'll not be available for the test series vs India.,84
DK going to get a fine after this match,7
So KKR has gone the Shadow captaincy route? Might as well make Morgan the face.,9
Why did this innings take more than 2 hours to complete?,14
Nothing like the comforting alpha presence of Eoin Morgan to guide you through a death over,7
End of a S-T-R-E-C-H-E-D innings finally!! 2hrs 6mins for 20 overs ?,18
Dinesh Karthik back with his slow over rate,2
"Great maturity shown by Mavi upfront and in the end 
Mumbai will be sad that they didn't hit the 200 mark 
But highlight of the innings was Rohit and his hitting and ofcourse Pat Cummins justifying his price tag by maintaining ER Close to that",9
We are 10-15 runs below par I guess. Getting Dre Russ and Morgan will be key,2
David Hussey looks like he has aged 30-40 years since he retired,3
Those 20 extra runs from cummo going to come back and haunt KKR,3
"Cummins better watch his back, KKR would try and send him home with an injury and let insurance take care of his 15 crore salary",9
"15 runs less of what was looking halfway, but still a good score...can't say it's safe with Morgan Russell and Dew",3
"Karthik's the specialist tosser

Morgan's the real captain",11
[removed],15
Shivam mavi the most impressive young fast bowler in this season,5
2 hours 10 minutes to bowl 20 overs . What‚Äôs up with the over rate ?,10
"195 is good but it should have been 210. Those 15 runs are the difference between a chaseable and a really difficult to get total. 

Also Pollard should not be not out after facing 7 balls at the end of 20 overs. He should come in earlier.",9
"Love you Polly.

MI Legend.",8
[removed],9
Umesh Yadav should learn from Mavi.,6
"Kkr can chase this with Morgan, Russell and Dk",6
"20 run short because dew, but KKR also have shite record against MI",4
Morgan was acting like captain,11
[Has COVID19 been renamed as Hardik Pandya?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EinKafrU0AArQaH.jpg),4
Sweaty beast,5
This game is all on Morgan and Dre Russ,9
Pollard's beard almost looks fake. Too well trimmed and shaped!,17
Thats... Such a wholesome thing to say.  Of all people didn't expect polly to say that.,7
MI were robbed if that 4th Cummings over!!!,8
Only one time MI lost after scoring 190+ in IPL. That was against Delhi Daredevils in 2018.,5
I really want Gill to perform. Should be his breakthrough season where he scores 500+ runs,6
"DK has given up, he just wants to go to csk next year lol. Looks like McCullum has taken over everything.",14
"Yesterday,Even with more sixes they finished 1st innings much earlier.",4
Dre Russ storm loading..,2
When does the second innings begin?,2
It's not Russell that I fear. It's that damn Morgz that sends shivers down my spine.,10
"I closed the stream after innings end , what did Pollard say ?",5
"Rohit getting out dropped the score by 10-15 runs. KKR got lucky with Hardik's wicket,  take nothing away from Russell and Mavi at the death. Should be good to watch this chase, seems gettable.",2
"**Worst ER for KKR in IPL (3+ overs)**

17.00 (51 off 3) L Balaji vs MI Kolkata 2011

16.33 (49 off 3) J Unadkat vs MI Mumbai WS 2016

16.33 (49 off 3) P Cummins vs MI Abu Dhabi 2020 

*Cricbuzz*",6
"Narine isn't 100 percent , should he open against boult, Pattinson ?",3
Man everybody saw it's Morgan who handled it in end.,5
Remember when T20's finished in 3.5hrs? This is going to push 4.5-5,4
"Shivam Mavi, back from a long injury lay off, has to bowl 2 overs at the death under pressure against Rohit, Hardik and later Pollard, and kept all 3 of them relatively quiet. Huge confidence boost for him.",4
Terrible over rate. Dk should be fined,5
"Rohit struggled to run between the wickets,, what could be the reason?",3
Wait are they expecting narine to open in all matches?,2
I‚Äôm more scared of Morgan than Russ tbh,9
"The treatment being handed to Pat Cummins is not surprising at all.



He neither bowls yorkers, nor into the pitch.  Just bowls a good length at pace which doesn't always work in white ball cricket.






KL Rahul carted him to all corners in the ODI series earlier this year and even before coming here, the Englishers smacked him for fun.







Only if you don't follow enough cricket that you will be surprised how he is being treated right now.",56
I'm not sold KKR can do this even with their batting lineup. SKY and Rohit were too good. Not sure sloggers can do it. It all depends on Gill and Rana imo.,5
"Not sure who should I support today. SRH and CSK lost back to back, ruining the previous two evenings for me.

Go KKR!",3
Cummins earnings/ball just went up since he didnt bowl his full quota.,6
Imagine if KKR had bought Alex Hales. Must be awkward for Morgan,11
"Don't know if anyone else knows this

But that's former F1 driver, Karun Chandoks brother Sunil Chandok talking to Bret Lee on Star Sports",15
"mavi was so good! bowled better than the pros at the death,great stuff.",17
"I think MI should have sent Pollard instead of Tiwary after the wicket of Suryakumar, given that pollard needs atleast 10-15 balls before he can start hitting the ball out of the ground.",6
Gald KKR has Ferguson to compensate for Cummins. Not seeing him play more than 4 matches.,5
Will Narine open?,5
Waiting for customary tweets from Vaughan and Nasser about the time this innings took and why The 100 will revolutionize everything.,7
"They should have given captain position to Morgan.
It is good both for kkr and Karthik.",9
Morgan is a natural captain.,6
"If any KKR fans are sad there's a dude on 
r/PAN Working out in Deadpool costume .Just saying",5
"I m ready with my heart

Plz win it over Subhman

GILL. jitega sabka dil",1
[deleted],46
"hoping morgan doesn't just flow like his usual self, he's more dangerous than roided man.",3
"Bruh, the tiktok knockoffs are the worst",1
Inb4 Naraine opens and scores 100 in power play,6
So what did Pollard say??,2
"So, I gather every six and four that was hit tonight was due to DK's poor captaincy and every dot ball and wicket was because of Morgan guiding the bowler. Have I got this right?",40
Gill has one supporter in mumbai btw.,10
What's the point of starting at 7:30? They still take so long to finish an innings,8
"Karan Johar: ""Hardik what happened today?""

Hardik: ""Aaj me wicket me maar k aaya""",5
Karthik should do a Gambhir like in that season at DC. Isnt that how Iyer emerged as a captain?,2
"From cricbuzz : 

Highest successful chases by KKR

206 vs RCB Bengaluru 2019

200 vs KXIP Bengaluru 2014 (Final)

191 vs CSK Chennai 2012 (Final)

Two of them in finals.... wow",8
Pat's 140 SR gonna be handy tonight,3
Sunil Narine to Gill - strike hum lenge bas tum run out mat kara dena :d,6
Tiwari is so thicc man,4
Rohit Injured,3
How many viewers on Hotstar today?,1
"Pat and narine should open,that pat guy need to work for 15 crores",7
It'll be scenes if Pat Cummins gets a few sixes tonight. I really hope he makes up for it,3
inb4 Bmac pads up and starts blasting.,10
lmao reddit treating DK and Morgan to Kohli and dhoni respectively for india,4
I hope Pollard can captain well,4
Imagine having Boult and Bumrah in the same lineup. Wow,9
I feel like Boult vs naraine is gonna be good,3
Should atleast mention the average in a batsman's stats. Yeah SR is important but average isn't totally irrelevant in T20s.,3
"is that a Cross earring on Gill's profile photo

is he a Christian or is he wearing it as a fashion statement like the Japanese",2
"KKR started well last yr but imploded in the 2nd half of the season and there was some off field drama too. They still could have made it to playoffs by winning their last match but they lost it..... against MI, of course.",3
Damn Boulto is so sexy I'd lick the sweat off his body!,-3
Did kohli just promote sports betting as a viable method to fund your kids education! Lol should partner with byjus to complete the circle. What kind of mind numb upper management approved that fucking ad,14
Do you guys remember that clip of Pollard in 2017 final in which he pretends to tie his lace and says something to the batsman?,3
[deleted],20
Feel that this pitch can be tougher than the mumbai batsmen made it look.,4
Rohit not in the field? üò≠,6
I really want Cummins to perform this IPL so he can prove everyone wrong about him not being a t20 player.,6
Off topic but Csk's shirts are so nip-friendly.,5
Gill looking to play 10 dots and then explode - Watson agrees to the strategy.,7
5 dots. About time r/cricket writes off Gill as shitty.,62
Gill auditioning for that test match spot,11
"Gill is hitting it good , don't fuck up pls",3
Pollards beard looks like a wig,3
Pollard may be carrying more excess weight than Rohit,3
maiden.,3
Gill tryna payback maiden that mavi bowled,5
the only thing which keeps me away from liking KKR is they destroyed my man unmukt chand in 2013. He just perished after that season :(,8
In about three years Hardik will be only playing IPL. No Indian jersey once Kohli losses the captaincy,-11
Great start,3
In b4 Gill 50 ball 1 run,-1
Brilliant over.,3
Goddamn Boulto nice fucking over! Beautiful!,4
So this is a T19 now,12
"Fuck, a maiden.",6
"Yeah, he bowled a maiden but he didn't bowl a wicket maiden like Mavi.",6
Gotta enjoy Boult Bumrah... Till it lasts,7
1 maiden over checks out,3
"Ah, the good old Narine pinch hitter strategy",5
 mans lacking confidence,3
Starc would've been a ripper if he was in this IPL,4
Imagine what Boult would do to gill in helpful conditions ...,6
Best bowler in the world.,3
Overrated gill,-4
"The mom in Extramarks and Whitehat ad are the same , just noticed",3
El Boulto starts off with a maiden,6
Should have opened with Mr bants Banton,1
Shubman stating his credentials for the OZ tour,3
Good guys KKR ensuring RRR is above 10 before they get going,19
What the hell Gill ?? This isn't a test match. Ffs..hit 6 sixes of the 1st over or get out.,13
INTENT‚Ñ¢,1
This over definitely won't be a maiden,2
Boult is a steal for MI,10
[deleted],-1
"Mumbai have fallen 15-20 runs short. Their death batting was sub par. 

If KKR can get off to a decent start, send Russell to bat with atleast 8 overs to go, this is their game. Don‚Äôt do what MI did and send your biggest hitters to late after a great start. 

Russell at 4 should be their seasons mantra.",9
Bring dreruss at 3,3
Feel like shit just want Banton opening,10
Test cricket is best cricket.,6
Opening with Narine will never work in these long boundaries,8
Gotta love Finch for getting Narine to open,7
Definite 4 saved.,2
Kunfu Pandya is back,2
"I just don't get the ""let's get Narine to make a quickfire 20"" strategy when you have Banton on the bench...",8
Why would KKR even play Gill ? Don't they know that Gills don't work on land ?,1
Hardik showing Character‚Ñ¢,6
Saved a certain boundary there,3
Nice.,1
C'mon get them shots going Naraine,5
fantastic stuff from the one you call Fuckboi,10
Remember Pollard doing that at point. Now Hardik,3
This bowling line up looks deadly for even a top class test team.,6
"Off the mark, raise the bat",6
Oh look a run,3
Yay. A run!,3
This is fine,6
Oh look a run,3
MI strategy to keep opening batsmen intact.. Dont let russel in till 16th over,12
"Even if we lose this match, it doesn't count because it's against MI.",5
Pattinson only cost Mumbai 1 crore,6
Watching test cricket after a long time,7
I wish Narine waste some balls at the beginning,1
It's already over for KKR. Better play this to save the NRR now.,6
Three superb shots straight to fielders so far,8
Is it really a run chase unless the required rate is 2 a ball?,9
The crowd noise is just trolling now,6
They are gonna field well too now??OOF,6
"Chasing 195, 9 balls to get the 1st run lmao",10
Pattinson looks like a bully from high school,10
"Fielding looks on another level compared to game 01.

Great stuff.",7
Man these guys are under Bazz,3
oh i see in that Sky in the UK have no problem going TO AN AD BREAK IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OVER,3
here we goo narainne!,3
"Pattinson is like a cowboy cricketer. Bet he eats steaks for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",3
Who tf shouted catch it,9
Shoot he picked that early. Sweet as.,2
NARAYAN NARAYAN,11
BIG Dick Narine,2
Ooh mama,2
Narine just hits it so effortlessly,6
IPL is so conflicting for me. I hate MI as a team and want them to lose every game but Bumrah is my favourite bowler and I also want him to take a hat-trick.,6
This Mumbai kit will look a lot better with White or Yellow instead of this Gold,1
Don't shit on KKR yet. They are setting the stage for Russell show. It's would be so good to see him score 50 runs of the last 2 overs to chase this down,10
I forgot Narine smacked RCB *twice* lol,2
Ffs sky stop changing the channel without warning me,8
u/tdlan I saw that,3
James Pattinson is making 1/16th of what Cummins is making and I bet he does better than Cummins thru the IPL,15
"Back of the length ..under the neck , on the stumps ..

Notes of umesh yadav for Narine.",7
MI has a deadly bowling lineup ngl,7
i can‚Äôt decide which team i hate more in this match,16

"ICC be like this is illegal how can narine open he is bowler.

Now he is banned for opening the batting.",-1
"We just need to do a Csk

N get to 200

Easy peasy",-1

"They would keep banging back of the length slower ones, the pacers.",2
Who was that standing with DK? Looked familiar.,3

Gill pulling a Vijay today,6
Damn dugout feed is pretty fucking good. Was getting ear fucked for the last 4 games by the English commentary.,6
Yayyy,1
kid just choked under pressure.,2
How do you carry watching on UK sky go??,1

Lol Russel.,3
Mumbai had a zoom session with Sweden's greatest Johnty Rhodes after that CSK match,3
Pollard catches the ball like it's a fruit that he needs to eat for dinner,4
I am so pissed that we gifted Boult to Mumbai. It‚Äôs tough being a DC fan. Rabada and him were a lethal combo. We don‚Äôt need to use a foreign spot in our top order batting. It‚Äôs all Indian.,12

Karthik coming at 3 is terrible for KKR. That means Russell won‚Äôt come on till 6. The match will be gone by then. Their body language tells me they will send Rana and Morgan ahead of Russell.,-13

Please get Narine out so he can stop wasting time.,2
Hire RPS's astrologer or something.,7
DK will go down as a legend whenever he retires.,6

Kartick slices the ball like that really well,3
Good over from JP.,1
"Narine making full use of his Lux Cozi ""*Apna luck pehen ke chalo*"" jersey.",7
"I like the idea of DK at 3. KKR have too many accelerating type of batsmen. DK is best placed, with his experience to play through the innings. He's very good and busy in the middle overs and keeps it ticking. And he can clearly finish when required. Is one of the few Indian batsmen who's truly 360.",9
My dad almost had an aneurysm when he saw that BOTH teams had gold in their jerseys,7

It won't be fun to watch if it was too easy for Russell. He wants to get 90-100 runs in the last 5.,0
dk dick shot,2
That‚Äôs gotta hurt DK,2
That's plumb in the plums but not plumb LBW unfortunately Patto,2
Right in the slot,2
Dk is class but im conflicted about him coming in at no 3,1
One patty bought for 15 crores and the other bought as a replacement.,8
Narine can't run or doesn't want to ? And can't pull fast bowlers .,5
Binga should do stand up,3
Lol Lee just said that's hitting middle stump,5
Someone from mi has to do a nagin dance to burst out the sapera Karthik,3
Honestly kkr may have the strongest batting lineup in the league,3
What happened to women's IPL? Is it happening?,0
people are so fuckin quick to call someone a legend,3
I hope they bring morgan and russell next,2
NCN not fit or what? I wonder how long before Patinson is found out,-2
Should have run through him Patto. Make this AFL,1
Naik just wants to sleep already,2
Unpopular opinion: The Jio dhan dhana dhan ad is not terrible,-2
All that talk and in so many years morgan has played ipl I don't remember a single good performance.,4
Good riddance. Bring in Morgan.,2
With boult i think its best to finish his spell in the early overs. Delhi used him in death overs where he would bowl everything in the slot and so had terrible stats,2

What a catch Quinny,3
Nice catch!,4
EUGH the SOUND of that catch was pure sex,11
What a catch QDK. Earned his paycheck for this game already!,2
Why don't KKR just stop getting out and start hitting everything for 6? Have they considered this?,8
QDK again with that one hand,4
Morgan should've come at 3,1
The misery ends,4
What a fucking good catch. Reflex and athletism at its finest.,5
Hope KKR realised that Narine isn't the destructive opener anymore.,6
"**4.5** Pattinson to Narine, OUT,  **25-2**

Being a mumbai fam would say  this wicket was not needed,9
I hope the Narine experiment ends now. Tripathi has always batted well in the powerplay.,1
De Kock catches the ball,1
Pattison will do wonders for Mi this year.,5
Whattay catch,2

Gangnam style in 2020 lol,4
Narine's torturous inning comes to a sad end. The whole world knows his weakness now - KKR need to rethink him at the top now.,5
What a catch by QDK!,5
Thank god,2
Those quickfire opening innings from Narine don't work anymore,5
Cool cool cool cool cool cool,3
One handed de Kock,3
QdK made that catch look much easier than it was. Almost took it nonchalantly,7
The Narine opening experiment has overstayed it's welcome tbh. He is only great against spinners. No need to send him to open when you have got so many batsmen lined up behind.,8
"Unless something changes very soon, Narine is a free wicket now for quicks in the power play.",3
Just keep bowling bouncers to Narine I guess.,1
Pattinson has aged so much,7
Send Cummins..it's high time,10
That‚Äôs about how much he can give you with the bat,3
2 of the fap 4 are there today :- Hardick and de cock,10
Someone shoot the DJ,4
Lmao Lee's been hilarious,2
"Does anyone know the bat Shubman Gill was using ???
He used Ceat sporsored ones last season.
I am sure i have seen that bat before, its one thats rarely used.",3
What happened to the All-Stars game? Probably not happening ig.,4
Narine was basically trying to find a way to get out that looks natural,7
"Narine has played 10 balls in the powerplay and scored 9 runs.

This experiment is over.",7

Pattinson plays with his heart on his sleeve. Love the bloke already.,6

Still no Morgan?! KKR have shit strategy,7
Should have sent Morgan here,6
"The fuck is a challenger spirit?

If I go talk shit to a burly bar bouncer, am I an idiot with no brain cells or am I an idiot with the Challenger spirit?",3

"I can send my grandpa and he'll play short ball better than narine



And my grandpa's dead 2 decades.",0
Get the Narayan man out and yes I am supporting KKR,2
Why not morgan???,2
These guys are 25/2 in the power play chasing 195.,1
Good wicket keepers are underappreciated. You only hear about bad keepers,3
Man people were saying Pattinson will get hit a lot. He's not bad,1
KKR have botched this up in 5 overs. Scored no runs lost 2 wkts,4
"Kkr gave DK 3 years, what a waste",1
I'm so glad Pattinson got back to playing cricket. Didn't look like it would happen at one point.,2
i think kkr thinks they‚Äôre playing odi,3
"It's raining again and my satellite TV has lost connection, thank god the match isn't in Mumbai",5
"My predictions failing again today.

3. Who will score more runs in the match?

Both these batsmen have played for Mumbai at some point in their careers. I hope they remember the sweet sweet Ambani love before scoring any runs,3

The match is pretty much over... first power play killed it...,1

All set for a classic 82 off 34 from Russell,4
Lmao Naik 64 strike rate,3
Streaming services really be naming themselves 'MX Player' and then wondering why nobody's watching,12
KKR take a look at your NRR,3
Narine could work when a opponent has ok fast bowler not against sides like Munbai,3
Why not send Morgan in?,2
Imagine having Russell and Morgan in the shed and being 25 off 5 overs while chasing 196.,9
If BCCI continues this trend of robbing Pakistani players of chance at IPL some kids gonna become pilot and destroy India.,-16
Who is Nikhil Nail. Never heard of this guy,2
Patto looks like he's just swum the Channel.,1
"2 down and still no Morgan.

Eh?",2
Narine's good against spin but only good against Unadkat kind of 'fast' bowlers,5
Yeah KKR gonna fuck up their batting order this year as well.,6
The Thicc boi finisher just has a strike rate of 63.8,2
We need a batsman who bats like a cat.,1
"World cup winning captain at 5?

KKR have lost their mind.",3
Rahul chahar lookin like an indian virgil van dijk,2
Someone has to go and tell MI just scored 5 runs short of 200.,2

Who was the fat dude who took the catch for kkr?,1
"Kkr already has 2 vijay innings in batting n 1 3dvijay in bowling tonight

Waiting for other vijays",-1
Mumbai is good at picking up overseas fast bowlers  for 2 seasons then letting go when they have become ordinary,6
"KKR should slot Narine at his natural position in the lower order. Get rid of this Naik and open with Gill and Tripathi. 

RR wasted Tripathi by playing him in the lower order last year and KKR are wasting him by not playing him. 

He was a very solid opener for RR the year before.",7
Lubing myself up for when Russell tears us apart.,7
Damn he done did it,0
It would be insulting to Russell if the req run rate is less than 15 when he comes in. Hence the slow batting,8
Rana plays so much like Raina tbf.,6

Anyone else feel like getting a Mohawk after seeing Russel?,1
i hope Morgan does well today. haven't seen him bat good in a long time,4
"Welp, match is done. No way KKR wins from here",2
Who is better SKY or RANA?,3
Rana is the raina we need,1
[deleted],4
Russel needs to come before 10th over if KKR wants to win the match. Russell was wasted down the order in cpl too.,2
strange mi hasn't used ishan kishan or coulter-nile yet.,2
MI would do well to just keep things tight and not take a wicket. Something RCB didn't do at Chinnaswami last year and resulted in that epic game.,6
Russell looks bored waiting for his teammates to play Tuk tuk and make the match challenging for him.,2
Sweet child o mineeeee,3

Why doesn't hardik bowl now or it's just more better option?,1
Now this is the intent CSK lacked yesterday.,5
This is as bad as it can get. Why Pollard ?!!!!,3
Rohit trolling now by sending Pollard,6
The trumpet noise is so funny coz there is no crowd to do ole,4
Pollard bowling is a surprise..,3
Why are these batsmen pretending it's an ODI,3
Has been ages since Pollard bowled,4
Rana and Karthik. T20 is still evolving in terms of planning and strategy and in the future two players like Rana and Karthik will not be paired to bat at the same time. Teams will for all 20 overs try to have at least one big hitter in the middle.,5
"Pollard bowling!! This could be great for my fantasy team, not so much for MI!!",9
Pollard bowling is peak shithousery,6

IPL teams and the colour gold ‚Äì name a more iconic duo.,11
What did rohit expect bumrah to do? Dive? I'd just let him bowl and sleep on the field.,7

"Seems like cummo got into one of the worst teams this season 

I thought RCB was the worst",4
KKR's chasing reminded me of COM batting in Cricket 07. Whatever the target is COM players bats too casually at a fixed 5-6 run per over. It was frustrating to bowl at them.,6
Just 8 off the over,3
Bowling slower than Jadeja,4
"Wait, do the players hear the crowd chants as well?",3
How are these batsmen supposed to know they need to bat with Intent^TM if KP isn't there screaming it out like a banshee from the commentary box,23
Only 8 of Kieron's over is criminal,4
Don't let this match distract you from the fact that the whole marketing team of thums up sat down and settled on the idea of ranveer singh somehow sneaking inside a hot air balloon to snatch thums up from a guy and drink it for no reason other than sheer force of will.,30
Pollard is the opposite of Hardik in terms of their bowling,3
Glow and Handsome. Cringe,5
I feel Pollard might actually be tricky to hit through. Both these players aren't pinch hitters so you gotta create the power to dispatch these 110-120 deliveries. Won't work with Russell of course but might as well get a couple of overs in.,2
Jesus some of these body shapes. Cricket/IPL must be the only pro sport that I'm not fat enough for.,8

"And mand kaa tola, jo downvote kiya wo.....",3
Bring in Russel,7
Imagine taking singles against Pollard when you have to strike at 200.,9
"off topic question - 
is it just me or I never see Kohli making field adjustments as much as Rohit or Dhoni ?",6
"""Pollard has a bag of tricks"".  Translated into common language means that he bowls shit and takes wickets because the batsman was being stupid",14
"Nice, play out the Pollard overs. Always got trundlers like Bumrah to attack later.",9
Why the fuck are you milking Pollard and not whacking him into the orbit?,1
Mahela needs to pee,8
Mahela = Dancing shoes on,8
Where's Andre Russell when you need him,5
What the fuck man,5
"Asking Morgan and Russel to score at 12 an over for 10 overs, is that a bit too much?",6
"Yeah this game is done and dusted 

First loss for KKR hope cummo gets in form soon 

Looking forward to KKR Vs RR",5
Ffs singles aren't going to do anything,3
At least pretend to give a shit,2
At least show some fucking intent.,3
Behenchod downvoters,4
"After this over need another 3 overs from Krunal, Chahar, Pollard.

MI missing Hardik's bowling highly!",7
Kkr seeing a jofra archer in pollard so theyre playing him out,10
RRR over 12 and taking singles against pollard,8
Hmmm Bumrah looking yum yum yum,6
When will Hardik start bowling?? It's fucking with the team balance,3
This is a boring game,4
KKR repeating the same mistakes as last year,1
KKR treating Pollard like Bumrah,5
"Come on guys, you don't have to be boring if commentators are busy with Mahela. Show some intent.",-3
"Rohit has a problem coming up, Hardik not bowling, at least one or 2 overs of slow-ish bowling to come.",0
phew downvoter is gone finally,-3
i thought this game would be funny bc i dislike kkr but this is just sad,-1
how's Pollard doing this?,3
Watch Morgan get called overrated after these cunts send him in against Bumrah with the RR 15.50.,4
7 off Polly's over is all I need to know about the intent.,4
Did anyone get a dm to downvote?,1
They are not even trying smh,1
Is it really shit bowling if it gets wickets?,-2
Commentators are sleeping on Eion Morgon,5
Looks like polard will be bowling 4 with the spinners chipping in a couple each. Who would've thought,-4
Why are they going easy on Pollard,-2
I‚Äôm starting to zone out... someone bring out Morgs. I need to hear him yelling NOOO,2
At least in yesterday's match we got to witness Dhoni's fuckery and troll innings.,3
There are so many players. There has to be someone with reddit account browsing r/cricket. Right?,7
Should have bowled Pollard last game,3
"Decent over by Pollard, Rohit probably looking to slip in a few overs before Russ shows up",0
"Pollard might probably bowl his full quota today, he has been really effective.",3
Russel and Morgan in this situation would be ideal tbh,-1
Whatever happened to Lendl Simmons? He played soo well for Mumbai. If he was an Aussie he would‚Äôve gotten a million dollar deal. His record in the ipl is amazing. Remember soo many of his knocks,-1
"Deano comparing Dre Russ to ferrari, hope he is not like this year's SF1000 shitbox",3
"125 in 10

Still not that hard if dreruss n morg have normal days in the office",0
Zzzzzzzzzz,-6
Morgan has to bat at 4,-4
Bottled,-4
After watching these 2 nitwits bat Russell will be over anxious when he gets in and he'll go out on a duck.,-5
Morgan Russell still to come and these guys are clowning around with rr over 12,-5
Hopefully we can get their RRR to over 15 by the 15th,-4
Yeah Boi Rahul!,-8
Upvote if you have big pp,-4
yikes,-7
There are 3 overs of Bumrah left & they just nudged Pollard smh,-6
At least Russel can come in now,-2
Our van dijk is the best van dijk,-3
Respect to Karthik for not doing a Dhenier .,4
I'm happy for the wicket but I'm terrified at the prospect of Russell coming in,-4
Good Gtfo Karthik.,-8
Thats as plumb as it gets,-5
I N T E N T ‚Ñ¢,1
KKR need 125 off 60 now. Seems difficult,-2
"Gone swinging, DK. Fair.",-3
The downvoters have very big penises and are loved by friends and families,10
This is worse than how CSK played yesterday,-4
They are playing too defensive for their own good,-2
"**10.1** Chahar to Karthik, OUT,  **71-3**

Gonzo. YESSSS great comeback by Chahar.,-1
"That is so out

Don't even think it's possible to be more out",-1
"Send Morgan one half would be mad, send Russell the other half would be mad",5
Plumbest of plumbs,3
Morgan or Russ?,-3
Tactical by KKR cap. Russell will smash now.,1
Send in Dre Russ now. If you want a shot at the game.,2
Russell needs to show up now. He's the only hope for KKR,4
Even Pollard doesn't give a shit about his bowling,3
[deleted],4
"Based on performances so far in the IPL, who do you guys think deserves more opportunities in the international team?",4
the downvotes in this thread,11
Karthik wicket is bound to be a blessing in disguise for KKR considering Andre Russel and Eoin Morgan still to come,2
Too early for Russ?,-1
Good luck Morgs!,6
30 of 23 balls. That is what you expect from DK. Nothing more than that.,-2

Dre Russ vs spin? Dont think thats a good idea,0
"Everyone is downvoted , serial downvoters on loose",10
Who the fk is downvoting every comment.,12
I understand dre russ in a beast but morgan is no joke.,3
Pollard had 8 wickets in 6 matches with economy of 7.55 this year in cpl.,9
Kohli would‚Äôve reviewed that,13
Fuck I though it was out,5
Morgan is struggling,2
Fucking useless this team,2
Typical KKR Leave too much for Russ,7
Ahh nrr 12 too low for DreRuss to come /s,11
They should have brought Nikhil Naik in instead üòÇüòÇüòÇ,3

Wouldn't mind seeing Morgan and Dre Russ having a go together.,1
Whole of r/cricket will shag downvoter's mum,16
[deleted],6
Good guy Morgan boosting the confidence of young Indian bowlers,15
Why does he look so clueless,4
Clive Rose,6
Morgan gonna do a sam Curran,-2
Morgan has not been very successful in IPL. Mainly because of his limitations against spin in the middle overs.,9
Just putting it out there for people perplexed by Dhoni not playing up the order. CSK had an extended quarantine time frame compared to others.,8
"Smart bowling, DK went after him early in his previous overs, went for the quicker ball early this time.",1
This is the same guy who cunted Rashid all over the park,6
Morgan should come in at 4 and Russ at 5,5
lmao there was a guy earlier who said russell was gonna bat at 6 and he was downvoted,11
Morgan can take Rashid to cleaners but can't pick Chahar. story of his IPL career so far.,8
Why are kkr pilulling a csk?,2

Looks like we have an army of sad downvoting clowns.,12

Morgan - That's illegal. You can't turn the ball.,12
Deepika Padukone in Jio ad kekw,5
Stop complaining about the downvotes. Keep Calm and upvote. They usually give up soon.,14
None of the commentator can pronounce punjab properly still and these idiots saying ion room nonsense get over it,5
Yeah this game is done. Russel probs going to get out first ball trying to hit it for six. KKR deserve all the shit they get. Haven't learned a thing,5
Chintu and his app can fuck off,4
"I'm obviously no expert, but how come no one in the KKR thinktank ever thought 'how about we send Russell in when the RRR is not 300 for once?",7
KKR getting clowned by Virgil Van Dijk Lite,1
What's with so many comments being downvoted for nothing ?,-1
Go on downvote me lmao. As if fake Internet points mean anything. Bunch of crybabies.,-3

What a superb catch by hardik,12
PP partnering up.,5
Now r/cricket will be at peace. Dre russ in,7

Morg and Russ.,4
Don't worry KKR fans Russell's on his way,5
Pollard has a wicket now. Mumbai really is Kolkata's bogey team,6
KKR should celebrate that wicket of Rana more than MI.,6
Polly is crushing.... 190+ score doesn't hurt either.,2

Are you kidding ??? üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ Incredible fielder Hardhit . First wicket since 2015 for Polly. It must be that Yusuf Pathan wicket in the last over he bowled.,7
Russell to be dismissed first ball,-6
"**11.4** Pollard to Rana, OUT, lovely catch by H Pandya. Pollard's slowness means Rana has to create all the power on this lofted cover drive. Pandya is off the fence and he has to run back to hold on and he has to keep the fence in mind too. He does all that, and makes it look easy. Pollard's first IPL wicket since 2015 **77-4**

N Rana c HH Pandya b Pollard 24 (18b 2x4 1x6) SR: 133.33",10
Lmfao Russell once again coming in with the RR 15. You can't make this shit up.,9
Tbf if anyone could do this- it‚Äôs Russel and morgan,7
Fuck Whitehat Jr.  ad,12
KKR top order just fuckin sucks. Some days Narine comes off other days you realize how dumb it looks when he is facing Bumrah and Bolt with the new ball,7
Rahul Dravid is so awkward in that ad,5
"Everytime this hindi commentator says muscle russel , I lose few braincells .",13
The expectations KKR has on Russel are like the expectations my dad has on me.,25
2 sixes,5
what's the song? heard it but forgot the name,2
I feel like KKR bat slow on purpose because they know Russell will pick up the slack at the back end.,6
Morgan Dhoni,8

Ye sub me kon apni marwa raha hai so many fuckin downvotes,12

Hardik shudnt have caught that as per the match situation,10
Why‚Äôs Morgan whiffing every ball?,9
"Even if Russell wins them this game, KKR think tank won‚Äôt learn their lesson.",14
Russell have >8 overs. Lets see if he still got *it*,10
Pollard has given us a few valuable overs today. We'll take that with both hands,5
Prepare for a first ball solid defense.,8
Pollard has his first IPL wicket since 2015.,17
Downvoter shills for Whitehat Jr to feed himself,20
"Me: Worried that he would touch the boundary ropes.

Pandya: Didn't even flinch.",16
Pollard 1 for 22 in 3 overs is goldust.,24
"It is somehow very hard to hit Pollard, he just bowls slow and good lengths.",14
"Seems like KKR is going to go down tonight, that means the last 4 games would be lost by the teams winning the toss and chosing to bowl. Nasser Hussain would feel right at home in IPL.",30
Russel should pull in a dhoni kkr will lose their shit. It will be peak entertainment.,19
Where is this whitehat ad,12
Pollard's first IPL wicket in over 5 years,13
How funny would it be if Morgan ran dre Russ out for a diamond duck,12
Finally mrf zlx gave us an ad in chiku's OG voice.,11
"Great catch, made it look easy.",12
There is only one combination that can win it for kkr it's the one right here if these can't do it it's game over,17
KKR do something bro,13
Am I hallucinating or did they change the MRF voiceover with Koach ?,23
We need to hit some sixes.,12

This should be a good contest.,4
Bumrah will get tonked all over now,1
Wicket alert,4
"Bumrah vs Russel
Oh mama",4
"Here we go, Russell walking out",3
If kkr can pull this off they r pretty much undefendable,3
Bumrah vs Russell is the ultimate battle,9
Russel should purposefully get out for a Golden duck and troll KKR,16
Downvoter's wife will suck my cock! Plz upvote guys,29
Bumrah vs russel interesting...,8
It might just be me but I think KKR are falling behind,7
Fierce from Bumrah. Here we go,8
Blockbuster,2
"Fuck, that must have hurt",5
Did they just call Dre russ a right handed Narine,4
If Russell gets going then 117 from 46 isn't a big deal. IF,3
Thanks to IPL I've seen one of the best yorkers. Aka Rabada vs Russell in that super over,3
Ooooooohhh. I liked fired up Bumrah.,4

Feels so awkward watching Bumrah do this cause he's literally so nice lmao (just like Kane Williamson),15
"Kohli rubbing off on Bumrah, lmao.",5
"KKR spin attack is struggling... clearly they planned for Eden gardens where the pitch off late is pace friendly.

Narine is half the bowler he was before changing action, kuldeep gets worried about getting hit than taking wickets.

Any other options ?",5
damn can't believe they played Pollard like Cottrell or something..,5
8 off 11 nobody talking about in 14+ RR run chase,8
Love the aggression from bumrahüî•üî•,9
Bumrah has big balls,14
Last year there was a koach cartoon. Is it still on?,5
What a pathetic run chase,5
F for KKR,6
Russell needs to do some hard hitting in order to keep KKR in contention,2
Only Russell can save KKR with his power hitting,2
Did boult just do a fake throw?,4
This bumrah kid is pretty good,15
I had almost forgotten how weird bumrah's action looks. How does he generate the pace he does with that t-rex looking runup,8
I've been spamming A-J to upvote everyone to balance the downvotes no worries mates,5
Russell vs Tiwary fight would be so fucking amazing,9

Wtf was that by Morgan!?,1

Bumrah should be in the national team already,3

What an over was that.,4
Bumrah bowling to scare everyone off.,9

Kkr almost their..... to 100,3
Harsha should come to the dugout! I hate the ads,5
Those Zing bails are definitely a little heavier than regular wooden ones. Seen so many of these types of situation in the last few years with them.,8
Where are all the Dhoni haters from yesterday? Why arent you guys saying jackshit about this innings from Morgan??,3

Morgan in Ipl is so shit,5
WhY iSn'T MoRgAn HiTtInG sIxEs?,9
KKR might have just decided to play for NRR. Sort of like what CSK did in their last game.,10
Has the pitch gotten harder to bat on?,2
People hyped Kkr way too much aint it,7
I want to see a good chase but also don't want my bowlers to get hit fml,2
Bumrah broke Morgan's rib! Astonished to see an Indian fast bowler do that!,3
Slow gun Morgan,3
"you may not like it, but this is how you chase 196",3
At this stage MI were 33 runs ahead KKR,2
Mi might as well load up on bumrah and Boult now. This is the only potential dangerous partnership,3
In hindsight. faf and Dhoni did well to save the NRR yesterday. KKR heading for a heavy loss with 2 more Bumrah overs left.,16
"Yo, remember when you hit 16 6s in a game?",7
"That ball at the ribs was scary, Bumrah so good",8
Surely it's all over for KKR??,8
Pattinson in.. Chance for Kkr to fire?,3
This is just agonizing to watch,8
Patinson gonna get tonked this over,3
Man I hope they rethink about the captaincy now. And also to stop with the Narine opening experiment.,5

"Lol people comparing morgan to dhoni seriously. Dhoni came in after 15 overs in a role where you have to get going. Morgan isn't doing great he'll get his share of slack calm down. 

It's just that dhoni pulled this nonsense way too many times and morgan hadn't",3
Is this pitch actually just hard to bat on? Did it change after Mumbai's first 10/12 overs,3
Boult and Bumrah top 2 ODI ranked bowlers in the same team is unfair. On the other hand KKR decided to buy the top ranked test bowler.,30
That shot doesn't look good,2
"Can't watch the game right now, just here to read the comments. Damn I missed this energy!

You guys are awesome. ‚ù§Ô∏è",7

"The thing is, Morgan is trying, flaying his bat. Dhoni didn't even try before the last over.",6
Russell be like I am done wiping your shit. Won't bat if you leave 12+ RRR for me to deal with.,4
Morgan hitting it for a six..,2
[deleted],2
"Gill, Morgan and Dre Russ have to bat in the top 5. KKR need to choose their other 2 between Karthik, Rana and Narine.",1
Oh Captain My Captain rise up and hear the bells,1
Bengaluru vs Karnataka tomorrow,6
Yesterday‚Äôs match being replayed today,2
Tomorrow‚Äôs match: RCB vs RCB lite,22
Runs just aren't coming for KKR at the moment,4
"r/cricket is more frustrated seeing Morgan getting beaten than himself and the KKR management, ngl",12
I don't understand why you all prefer Bhogle over any other commentator. He's downright atrocious.,-10
Need a lot more of those from the england captain,5
The RCB vs KXIP bit was more interesting than KKR's batting till now,14
Really makes you appreciate Rohit's Batting today with both these struggling out here now.,19
Go Wide yorker to Irish Morg.,1
"Oh boy here we go, finally a six",1
Hope they can connect a few more hits otherwise this game is gonna fizzle out real quick,2
"I dont see kkr winning but i want it to be a close match alteast, too much yawning atm",11
Unnecessary six.....they shud play safe....,8
Yes the Morgan we know,7
Forget the win now. NRR will be costly,19
Morgan is hitting too many wide balls here,8
They ain't scoring 100 of 6,11
Both Pattinson and Boult have taken much load off from bumrah.,16
KKR are loosing since 1st over,11
In before morgan gets bowled,10
"Nikhil Naik be like,

""Bruh I get only one game a season. You guys seriously gonna send me out with required run rate at 20 rpo!""",18
"Tomorrow is going to be so troll üòÇ

It'll be a match to see alright",14
"Just hold on KKR, few more overs and we're off to Day 2",45
Morgan will play different if he would be the skipper,9
Bouncer on Russell..,8
"pattinson is mcCleanaghan, mcCleanaghan is pattinson.",7
"If anyone plays Eoin Morgan in a movie, it should be Mark Wahlberg.",14
"Andre ""only beast on indian pitches"" Russell",9
Need 100 from 6 overs. Lol,3
Even as a Mumbai fan I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing some fireworks from KKR right now. It‚Äôs getting quite boring.,10
Why none complaining abt rusell knock tho,4
Bumrah is the capacitor as an user on here described him a few years back. Doesn't take the wickets but the economy and tight bowling supercharge the entire bowling attack.,13
Let's not jump on Morgs. Even Dre Russ hasn't got going.,5
"Every finisher is suffering from MS Dhoni syndrome this IPL.

WTF is going on!",13
I'd just bowl Bumrah out here and finish the game if I were MI.,4
IM LOSING MONEY! HIT THE BALLS FOR FOUR AND SIX FFS,3
I N T E N T‚Ñ¢,1
Starting the tournament against the team that has already played a game in the the same ground and has always had a mental edge over us all throughout the years was going to be tough. But the batsmen looked out of sorts as if they hadn't faced that a many tough conditions at the nets. Really disappointed with Shubman.,3
You know why he didn't let that go harsha because Morgan is ardent follower of SunnyG.,1
KKR needs 106 from 6 overs now,1
Morgan trying to swing it..,3
"Coulter Nile is in the MI squad too, they have some great pace options.",2
gotta love morgan‚Äôs batting face,2
KKR never got going. Bizarre approach and Morgan ate up too many balls.,2
2x boult and bumrah overs left.. I'd say game is over,3
"Karthik is just good with potential.

He never really delivered his so called potential ever actually",0
[deleted],7
"KKR should have had a much better start. This is kinda worse than what CSK did yesterday.

It doesn‚Äôt feel like they changed anything from last year. They seem to be looking at Russell to always bail them out.",2
Bumrah 2 overs 3 runs. Damn is this IPL or Aus test series started early.,9
Can we just take a moment to appreciate Boult and Bumrah bowling in the same team,14
[deleted],7
Dre Russ to plunder 70 from the next three overs,2
Kkr bein like prime rcb,1
Rohit can go out an all out attack with boult and bumrah for the next 4 overs and just close the game right here,2
God I wanna hear about the qUaNtUm Of LoSs,3
"Do people here not realise that KKR gave up on the chase a long time ago and are playing for the NRR now?

Look at Morgan. He's not even worried, because he knows he's playing the game right.",1
"Even now commentators are behaving as if the match is interesting.

So much talent there though",4
"KKR messed it up today, only peak Russell can save them, though it doesn't look likely with MI's strong bowling attack.",2
"Rcb vs kxip is going to be peak entertainment.

I expect atleast a Mankad and a bhenchod call during the first innings",4
Great intent from Morgan.,2
You never know with Russ. A Russ blitzkrieg can single-handedly  win it for KKR,1
Russ hit a 4??? How is that even possible???,1
KKR were shit last year too. Dre Russ carried them,7
"Don't get excited just yet , he needs a big six to get going",1
"If kkr to have a chance

Boult to replicate southee",1
"I've seen rohit dive a hundred times this IPL already, has he stopped anything yet though?",6
"There is no ill intent towards any team, but as a neutral (only watch IPL for performance of certain players) I'm glad that CSK, MI, and KKR each have lost a game at the start. Seeing them win all the time was getting too predictable. Much like Tennis Grandslam and the big 3 - Djok, Raffa, and Fedex have 56 fucking grandslam between them. Really want to see RCB, DD, KX1P or RR, and SRH in the play-offs this year.",11
Rohit was slow,-4
Chahar should replace Kuldeep in the Indian team,3
Damn Eoin and Russell channelling their inner Robbie from last season.,5
Still one over of Pollard / Chahar left,2
Looks like they finally got the dhoni out of their system,5
Gill with that maiden to start things off signalled KKRs intent in this match. I N T E N T,9
"Okay lets talk about tomorrow's match
James Neesham and Gayle in for KXIP?",1
Boult is bowling pies.,2
"Instead of piling on the batsmen from all the teams, maybe just maybe we should consider that bowlers have done really well in those cases.",9
DreRuss thingz,2
lol... edges are flying too. But they still need 6 18-run overs.,5
"The question is, how much is too much for Russell?",4
Bad luck,5
Russel swinging his bat literally gives panic attack .,5
"Guys, plz keep upvoting all comments! Looks like downvoter's are back again!",4
Guys where's the INTENT!!!!,7
Now even 4s not affecting nrr,7
At least CSK tried to win the match for 14 overs. KKR seems to have given up before the 2nd innings even started.,12
Just informing that we've crossed half the target now,13
Don't pity the fools plz Mr.T,3
"Just don't get smacked for 17 runs, you are doing fine. Lol",3
One of these two needs to get out so that Naik can save KKR.,4
KKR seems to be this giant corporation that needs the government(Andre Russell) to bail them out.,16
A six here and 90 of 30 will look nice,8
[deleted],8
"The top sides have great bench strength ,and people are talking about it , while the others are struggling with  the 11 that they play on match day .",7
"Russell should stop wasting balls and get out, so Cummins can get in",11
someone build an upvote bot to neutralize the downvote shills.,9
Kkr fans how do you deal w the heartattacks when russel batting and the ball going in the air,11
Oh brilliant ball,7
"Meanwhile every father in Home

""Yeh Russel definately kuch leta hai, woh druggie hai""",11
As a BCCI chairmen I applaud this chase ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞),2
Harsha casually mixing up his black men there.,7
russ doesn't look dangerous like last year,3
"First Man United and now KKR, why have my teams forgotten how to play the sport",3
Russell needs to play the innings of his life to take KKR anywhere near 196,2
great comeback,2
"Kkr were lucky to restrict mi to 196, with DK as captain and current bowlers they will struggle this ipl",4
"To everyone comparing this to yesterday, the bowling attack today is way better, the ground is also much bigger than Sharjah.",12
The kkr bench with dk and bmaz looks like a bench of judges judging a dance competition,9
"No way mumbai giving 100 off 5 with 2 bumrah overs, no way",3
Once again... KKR have left it too late for Russell. 2 seasons and you still can't figure out where to play the man.,9
Russell is definition of *andha ghumata hai*,6
Just waiting for some player to pop out and say match mai dekh keta hoon aap jaake dream11 pe team banaiye.,6
KKR just thinking this is a 150 score and not 196...No way they are getting this total.,3
96 off 5 overs seems tough,6
What would you guys say was Bumrah's average pace today ?,3
"Knowing KKR doesn't have a chance rn, I'd just have some fun as the captain by making a human fielder chain with the Pandya bros and chahar all on top of Pollard like the Krishna Janmashtami thingy and try stopping the 6",6
"This Morgan guy is average at best, maybe give him a chance in the Irish test team??!",14
Russell bowled!,6
Bhogle stuttering more than one of Shahid Kapoor's roles in Kaminey,7
Boom Boom Bumrah,5
There it is.,4
MUUUUAAAH BUMRAHH,8
Bruh,6
Yeahahhhhhh. Bumrah is backkk,10

Oh yes!,2
Bumrah and Boult in one team is like Kohli and ABD in one team.,17
Nikal laude,8
Russel not a guy with big PP anymore,16
Fuck Yeah,6
Safe to say Bumrah won that battle..,19
That's it. We're done here.,11
"Boom boom bumrah, Yorker at its finest",4
Bumrah is a fucking cheat code,6
Kkr need kevin o brien instead of morgan,1
....And ball game.,4
What an Intent‚Ñ¢,3
LOL Imma sleep now bu bye,3
What a flop!,5
Ngl that waa really satisfying,8
That's the game. Well played MI. Can't believe we've won our first points for the season.,15
"I knew I could always trust Bumrah, fuckin love that guy",8
The Yorker's back.,4
Now CSK's slow approach for NRR makes sense,12
And there goes Russell,2
BOOM,3
There goes your slogger,3
Rip kkr,3
"Yeah bye Russell, that's a quality yorker",3
This is peak Bumrah. What a bowler.,6
Bumrah!!,5
Bumrah too op,7
"First time watching ipl, I'm assuming kkr is the worst team right?",15
Bumrah just flexing right now,8
Bumrushed,6
Bumrah: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,5
done,2
Clean bowled :O,5
I pray for Bumrah‚Äôs fitness to be intact for 10-13 years more. What a fast bowling prospect for India. Finally.,11
"Where are the fucks who were claiming Bumrah has been figured out?

He isn't a spinner who will get figured out.",22
Match over,2
I hate the strategic timeout..,1
DRE OMEGALUL RUSS,1
GAZAB BEZATI HAI,5
Good night,2
Never seen Russell struggle like these. God save Kkr this season,9
I think dk has finished his job of breaking Russell.,4
"How come Mumbai has such a strong team.

Really pissed me off, their team is string enough to win a world cup.

I always want to see them loose",-3
Bumrah should only be given 2 overs in a match to make it fair.,8
Gg boys well played,3
"Good riddance, Morgan should get out too. Kuldeep and Cummins to win it for KKR.",12
Bumrah didn‚Äôt bowl a no ball yet?,3
Imagine Nikhil Naik doing a russel here . Omega lulz .,7
Their run rate is going to take a huge hit,3
"Oh Damm. Oh Damn. Oh Damn.    



P.S. where are my brooklyn 99 upvoters.",10
"1-3 in 2 overs, stark compared to his last innings",6
Nikhil Naik 64 strike rate coming up,5
"**15.1** Bumrah to Russell, OUT,  **100-5**

AD Russell  b Bumrah 11 (11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",5
"Who would have thought depending totally on 1 guy was a bad strategy?

Smh",11
Fucking obliterated,3
Bumrah wins the battle,6
FINISHING IT OFF IN STYLE,3
Mumbai vs Kolkata match in an arab country and DJ plays a Punjabi song,6
"Dre Russ?

More like Dre Rusty",9
Somehow people will still blame DK for this failure,2
My god my man Boomer is back !! Back with vengeance !! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè,10
"And now when you'll see KKR lose by 70 runs and spoil their NRR, you'll get to know the genius MSD is. He knew they were never winning the match.",2
"Chill KKR fans (if any) it's the first game, yes the tradition got ruined, but still something makes me believe in this team",8
First win in the UAE?,5
Wow thinking all the bye bumrah prime we got this is such a reply.,2
"I'm calling it, even Russell cant win this for KKR",0
Bumrah 's mojo is back,3
Russell complains about not getting enough balls. He came in at 12th over today.,4
Every time a 200 plus score is posted and you dont score 60 plus in the powerplay the game is essentially over.,9
"If KKR play the entire season like this , there is a high chance of going to the bottom of the table.",2
"Finally the wait is over

Thick boy Nik

Will walk in",2
"tbf to russell, he was brought late.",1
"FUCKING HELL, BUMRAH! JEEEEEZ",5
tomorrow kohli vs kohli lite,2
Pumped for tomorrows match,5
F in the chat,4
"Get ready for ""Ball wasn't coming onto the bat"".  
  
""Pitch became slow as game went on""",9
You fucking deserve that KKR! Sending the guy who can score like crazy when 5 guys are out and you need 100 something from 30 some balls.,12
All this sucking off of Andre Russell by the commentators and he delivers a flaccid performance,12
bye bye kkr,2
Sometimes you gotta play for NRR,3
Those pollard overs really cost KKR,6
Bumrah is currently the most important player for India.,11
I suppose I can go to sleep now.,4
You better fucking believe I downloaded the CARDEKHO APP on me phone.,2
Baz does not look happy. also surprised to not see karthik in the middle for the timeout.,4
That look like 'bro its that ball that gets you?!',4
Bumrah should be MOM. But they are gonna give it to Rohit.,9
Karnataka vs RCB,1
Think people are going to stop trying to chase after winning the toss now,18
Bumrah whataplayahhh!,3
How much IPL is popular outside India? Sky is showing west indies woman Vs England woman on full HD and IPL on SD.,7
KKR need to make Morgan the captain. He's clearly the better candidate and he's a different player altogether when he's captaining. Also they need to open with a proper fucking batsman along with Gill and play Narine at 7/8,0
[deleted],2
"1-3 in 2.1 overs, amazing",3
There goes KKR‚Äôs chances of winning,1
"Couldn't they build a longer table for dugout, why's the one guy sitting separately, looks wierd",1
"Bumrah: bowls full kinda full length ball and bowls Russel

Stupid commentator: Bumrah gets his yorker right!!!",7
All over?,2
"If you feel sad, just think about those people who would have chosen russel as their captain in dream 11",5
Glad to see us maintaining our reputation of giving MI 2 free victories every season,8
Dub no 20 against KKR! Let's go!,1
How good is this jojo rabbit movie they are advertising in Hotstar?,2
"With all the respect to Baz, who in their right mind would make him coach",4
Ads are more entertaining,3
"2013 : we need to play for the win here by playing shots
2020: nrr is more important boys, loosing goes brr",4
"Since the game is pretty much done at this point, we must take out some time to appreciate Brohit for hitting 6 6s on this surface",9
Yeah. I am thinking i am back - Bumrah,9
Wrong batting order by KKR. Remove Narine the hack from opening.,4
KKR to Morgan in strategic timeout: take it deep and hit 3 sixes in the last over,7
kkr rustier than my grandpa's 50 year old chethak,8
"Are you not entertained? Yes, bumrah this is not entertaining.",2
"How is 'Special OPS' boys ? Better/on par with Family Man, Paatal Lok?",2
Bumrah with the Night King celebration,3
"Actually this is not surprising. Russell was scratchy af in the CPL barring one knock. There was a match where Jamaica needed 24 off 2 overs and he played 7 consecutive dots (denying singles, etc). IPL 2020 is going to be way tougher for KKR than they think. They're not making the Top 4 if they don't sort out their batting order ASAP.",8
"Is KKR not going after the target Dhoni's fault too?

Weird how people keep blaming Dhoni.",5
Bumrah standing like an absolute boss there,3
KKR need to hit some sixes,3
Naik has already bettered his career strike rate. Expect big things from him,5
Feel like pure shit. Just wanna see Faf's 7 sixes and Samson's bat swing again :`(,7
Bumrah didnt even celebrate. What a man,3
There's an ad on Willow by an astrology baba who's in a suit. Now that's something.,1
1-3 in 2.1 overs lol,5
Win the toss and chase first.,3
"On an unrelated note, people who havent watched special ops on hotstar can give it a shot.. It's a pretty good show",6
Bumrah just conceded 4 runs and took dre rus? Legendary,9
Finally the time out's over,2
Who is this scrub and why is he here,3
KKR looks the most weakest team of all the other teams in this year IPL.,6
RIP NRR KKR,9
Dhoni: Now you'll know my tictacs of taking it Deep‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,12
LOL what a fatty bom bom hahaha,4
Dre Russ always struggles against balls targeting leg stumps. Well bowled,6
Now they aren't even playing for NRR,3
Ye naik aadmi hai ya aloo?!!,1
Scenes if kkr lose today by 50-60 runs and and thalas quantum of loss bites them in the ass.,6
Naik's chest bouncing around as he took the run,3
Isn't Andre Russell one of the best ipl players? Why was his batting and bowling so bad. Is he injured?,3
Give me that sweet NRR,3
Bumrah too OP! Please nerf!,3
Why are only Indian players unfit. This was not the scene 10-15 years ago,4
Thicc Naik can hit a few,1
"If MI plays its first game of a season against KKR, the universe would collapse.",12
Bring back Ten Descate for thr nostalgia,5
"Cue the greatest innings in short-format history. Morgan is going to tear this a new one.

Edit: oh, he's out.",5
Ridiculous,2
Boom Boom Sonic Bumrah is back,5
Good to see ma boi Bumrah back in the mix. <3 Take all my  love üí≤üí≤üíµ,7
"Rabada and Bumrah, worst nightmares for russell",9
Boom boom!!,3
"Does anyone remember the last time MI lost convincingly? Even when they lose, especially when they‚Äôre defending totals, they grab the opponent by the balls and make fans nervous. When they win it‚Äôs often convincing but other times close.",4
Morgan the finisher they said.,2
This is the difference between Rohit's captaincy and Virat's. Virat wouldn't have continued with Bumrah. Rohit always tries to kill the game when the opposition are down. He never gives them chance.,19
fuck off overrated piece of shit .,-2
Bumrah strikes again,5
This is the old Bumrah! Vintage performance,9
Bois Bumrah is back post injury,3
Boom boom. Gg Bumrah.,3
DK and Rana are so happy,3
"Bumrah is freaking cheat code, I'm so glad he plays for India.",16
RIP NRR,7
2 for 4,7
"Too good Jasprit.

Too good.",8
Write off bumrah at your own peril,7
Yo what are those Bumrah stats. Insane,7
KKR are fucked if Russel is not in form this year,6
This is not the KKR I know :'(,1
Knight riders management's first loss in 13 games,3
" kkr with such strong batting will be nowhere the target, make one think if dhoni was right yesterday.",6
DISMANTLED.,5
Pat cummins to win it...for MI,5
Stop Bumrah. They are already dead,5
Finally he's getting some wickets,3
Boom you maniac.,6
He is back baby,8
"You guys want him to be the captain but if he continues this kind of form for a few more games, Morgan would soon be contesting for his spot with Banton.",8
Bumrah finished  the match in just a couple of balls,6
i feel bad for karthik already. a lot of what went wrong here is not his fault.,4
[deleted],8
I thought Bumrah was finished. Or so they said.,5
Unpopular opinion: Bumrah is finally back!,8
And another one bites the dust,3
Boom Boom Bumbrah is back!,3
2.4 overs 2 wickets 4 runs .  amazing,7
Looks like Bumrah's back,3
lmao morgan is so shit in the IPL and we have few poms here asking why isn't he the captain,4
Not surprising at all that an England batsman failed on a non-road pitch.,2
Insane performance from Bumrah today. Nice to see him do well after a disappointing game on saturday.,5
fuck KKR,2
"Almost seen out the dangerous bowlers.

Great match saving innings from Morgan.",3
Removing his frustration from the last match,5
"Got their 2 best batsmen out in one over, what a fucking spell",10
"KKR look Doomed to be last this season, we are going to take a long time figuring out our best 11",2
"Alright, I'm gonna go cry.",4
"When Russell was batting 4m people watching
After Russell got out 3m people watching .",3
Bumrah miles ahead of any fast bowler only Starc comes close,-1
bumrah is a cheat code,3
Won't mind if MoM is given to Bumrah.,7
Go cum daddy. Cum all over mumbai.,3
GOD SHIT,2
"What a champion Bumrah is !! One bad match, shook it off, came back strong üí™üí™üí™üí™",5
KKR doesn't believe in Quantum of Loss^^TM?,9
I‚Äôve said it before but I love Bumrah,4
"Can we all just agree now that CSK wasn't wrong for bettering their NRR?? The damage kkr is going to take, even flex tape can't help that",19
KKR making CSK's efforts look genuine lol,14
Despite today's lackluster display Russel-Morgan is the partnership to watch out for in the tournament.,6
Bumrah 2-4 for2.4 overs... Wow,4
Bumrah is a fast bowler with the celebration of a chess player,10
Time for the dozen or so KKR fans to go sleep.,4
"**15.4** Bumrah to Morgan, OUT, and Bumrah has one more. Morgan backs away to try to hit over mid-off, but he is too good for him with the slower offcutter and takes the outside edge through to the keeper **101-6**

EJG Morgan c &dagger;de Kock b Bumrah 16 (20b 1x4 1x6) SR: 80.00",2
All out for 130 calling it now,2
KKR's Nrr is gonna be sooo fucked,4
Bumrah doing very well tonight,3
Best death bowler period.,12
Feel like shit just want Kallis Pathan era back :(,4
Best white ball bowler in the world.,4
"Zaheer totally not impressed by Bumrah.


Has a ""Show me something new expression."" On",9
Morgan intentionally lost the game. He wanted to teach lessons to the bowlers. So they perform better. He was clearly trying to lose the match.,16
"Dammm Morgan and Russell in one over, boom boom is back with a bang üëæüëæüëæ",5
Lol Nitish Rana with the highest sr in a kkr chase of 196,6
Stop it Bumrah. I can only get so erect.,9
MOM: Bumrah or Rohit?,4
"For all the hype train, Morgan+Dre russ got 27 off 31 balls combined. Pretty tame end.",15
"It's only their first game, so can't rule out KKR just yet. But their NRR is going to take a beating today.",6
Fucking Chintu ruining so many Indian kids lives now.,9
I'm predicting KKR will drop DK mid-season and make Morgan the captain.,10
Damn.. I've never seen Bumrah bowl a leg-cutter. Dude keeps working on new skills despite being this good already.,16
Fuck this match is gonna give a huge advantage to MI's playoffs chance as this has to be the most competitive IPL ever,10
[deleted],2
This is why women are less employeedi think kkr needs a bit of siddesh lad the mr dependable for mumbai in ranji,-2
Cummins will score a 50,5
NRR>KKR,9
"Bumrah was in my Fantasy League Team last match. He got tonked around so removed him.

I am as fickle as one can get, damn it",17
In b4 Cummins 95 in 26,3
"If this is a sign of how Russel is gonna play for the season, then KKR is doomed. their top buy didn't even finish his 4 overs, and Morgan is continuing his terrible Ipl form, but it is still their first game tho so we'll have to wait and see",3
Pat Cummins to score 7 off 9  to try and better NRR.,2
Cummins is gonna score back all the run gave when bowling.,2
"Fuck KKR, never liked them after they took Gambhir from us. Hope the NRR comes back to bite them",3
Oooofff... Quite a wallopping this. Solid NRR boost!,9
"17 cr, he needs to hit atleast 2 sixes",5
"I had been worried about who was gonna bowl that extra over. Bumrah has quelled all my fears in the span of 1 over. Fuck it give QDK the ball now, I won't complain",4
"All the trolls who said Dhoni played for himself, I wonder what you have to say about Morgan and Russell? Lol",12
Dhoni >>>> Morgan üòí,10
Bumrah is 3-0-5-2 . Fucking madness this,7
"Bumrah 3-0-4-2 awesome stats. 
Killed the game for KKR. 

Hopefully in last over he improves his stats with more wickets",7
"So everyone here says rcb is the worst. How?! They won a game, and they have kohli, ab, steyn, and finch. Not to mention good other players like chahal and zampa.

This kkr teams looks so much worse.",8
"Rohit and dekock as opening, pandya and pollard as finisher, Boult, Bumrah and Pattison as pacer. Dammm Mumbai is literally the best of best team.",11
So KKR neither went for a win neither for their NRR what the hell was their plan was it the start sucked everything out of them,12
Bumrah : 2-5 in three overs. Bumrah's a fucking cheat code,8
"Hopefully Bumrah gets a couple more wickets, purple cap needed.",3
"The commentators are still interested. Especially Harsha Bhogle .

There is a reason he is always called for commentary",10
aw man i really dont wanna lose to kkr this year,9
No team yet has played their best 11,5
CSK chased much better than this KKR batting line up,13
"Kkr needs a bit of Lad, the mr dependable for mumbai.",5

Nikhil Naik going to score a century surely.,4
Karthik is the worst IPL captain currently imo. Most of the games KKR lose can be directly attributed to his lack of game situation awareness.,6

KKR going to finish the league 8th. Bet.,7
Can't believe MI managed to retain bumrah for only 7 crores. If he had gone into auction easily would have gotten 10+,5
"You so badly want MI to be the psg of this tournament what with the ultra rich owner and everything, but its getting harder to hate them",3
"Suddenly Dhoni taking it deep to protect NRR seems reasonable, especially when they don't have someone like Dre Russ..",19
You can't defeat Mumbai without balling them out <160,12

Some people were saying Bumrah had been found out after the last match. Maybe time to sit down and stfu now.,12
Out,1
"Required run rate is 24. Once it goes past 36, Dhoni will suddenly come to bat... oops sorry wrong match",15
El Boulto strikes.,7
[deleted],3
64 strike rate maintained,6
So what exactly was KKR strategy for the chase?,4
I think every team has sort of struggled in their first game. I expect the competition to get more fierce very soon.,2
I'm one of the fans waving from the screen in the background. They tase us if we don't look enthusiastic enough.,6
Dropping like flies,3
Hahahah this is comedic,3
I am considering to sign up on Twitter just to get #SackKarthik trending somehow.,9
And another one gone,1
"Analysis on Dugout just keep getting better and better plus Scotty, Deano & Swann banter is bonus",2
now that's how you should play. Show intent.,3
"Naik nahi, Khalnayak hoon main...",6
Bumrah's figures are ridiculous wow,3
What a piss poor performance from KKR with both bat and ball. Credit to MI's bowlers though.,1
"Congrats MI for your win. GG KKR, you look a bit rusty. It's a long season.",1
Nikhil Naik at 7 is absurd he shouldn't even be in playing 11.,4
another one bites the dust,1
What an absolute unit Naik,0
BAZ IS SEEEEEETHING,2
"**16.3** Boult to Naik, OUT, short ball, over his shoulder, top-edges the hook, easy catch for deep midwicket. Mumbai looking to end this early now **103-7**

KKRs NRR is done for the season.,2
"KKR looked better under Gambhir, they're completely lacking in spirit for past few years though they have a good squad.",3
"Naik reminds me of Ramesh Powar.

Edit: Apparently Powar was the head coach of the Indian women's team and didn't play Mithali Raj in the semis of the WC. What a dick.",3
"If someone pays 11 crores for Unadkat and not atleast 20 for Bumrah, i gonna quit watching ipl.",4
Why Naik was included for this game is going to remain a mystery. All he did was take that dolly that QDK offered him,5
KKR seems like they're still jet lagged,2
What a dull chase? Iss se jyada intent se toh mai susu karta hu.,7
Best death bowler in the business right there! Jassi jaisa koi nahin!,5
Karthik has a IQ of 189 which is too big for IPL.,4
Get that fatty out of the team,-1
I wonder what McCullum has been writing during the whole innings. Any guesses?,5
Where's my boi Rinku? Why is he not playing,3
"Damn!

Pandya is the LAST person I expect to follow social distancing properly.",5

Never heard her laugh, seen all commentators laugh though",3
"You all got it wrong!!!

Cummins was paid 15.5 cr for his batting

Narine and him to open next match üòç",12
"The thing is Morgan has always been kinda shit in the IPL, but he's been in the form of his life in T20s recently so I was hoping this time would be different, still only one match tho but KKR needs to sort out their playing order too, Narine isn't scoring any runs anymore, bounce him and he's out",8
Are there many non-Indians watching this? Are you supporting any team? Makes me kinda happy to see this becoming an international spectacle.,8
Everyone was expecting 200 on this ground when the par score is 160. The bowling let KKR down. 195 with these boundaries was always going to be hard.,5
"Lets see of cummins can score 15

A crore for a run",3

"The way how everything MI touches turns to gold, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Deepak Hooda became an India regular it he started off at MI.",3
Having boult and bumrah in same team is really not fair,11
Wonder why Naik is in the team instead of Tripathi,5
30 runs per over is very easy to get. Lessgo Cummins and Mavi.,5
Why they didn't promote Russell up the order is beyond me,5
4D chess by Karthik. He wants to show r/cricket that Cummins is worth the price tag.,5
This is a good opportunity for these two to get decent batting practice,2
"Mavi stop hitting, already lost so much in dream 11 for not pickin him",2
"This is what is good about Rohit's captaincy , he kills the game with his best bowlers when the time is right rather than pushing the game till the end , having said that he is lucky to have world class pace bowlers",8
I would have definitely played Nagarkoti here. he may not bowl full quota but could have gotten much needed match experience.,5
Damn... Credit for sticking with the same XI. I was raging when I saw the team sheet. I clearly know a lot about cricket. /s,1
Hazlewood is a better limited overs bowler than Cummins but good for you KKR!,2
Damn I love these tips from the Dugout guys,3
Is it legal to show murder on live television?,8
18 balls left. They need to minimise the nrr quickly. Another 40 or so runs needed minimum,3
Good chance for bowlers to increase their wickets tally,1
"Lol, these two should have opened up, smh.",2
15 Crore showing intent,6
Cummins> Russell+ Morgan,3
Pat Cummins to hit 30 runs this over.,1
Cummins got some power man..,1
Bumrah gave away more runs on that ball than his first 3 overs combined,9
Sacred Games had such a dope background score man. Shame about the 2nd season,0
Mahendra singh Cummins .,3
"Scam idea: Call a random number and say 'due to too many IPL players getting injured, we are selecting a random person to play for [insert team name]. If you agree to play, please send us visa processing fee.'

If they don't buy this, give them examples of Vijay Shankar and Nikhil Naik as other recruits using the same method",9
Cummins hits bumrah for six. Karma balanced,2
This strategy of banking on Russell to deliver every time is not going to work out for KKR. They need an enforcer at the top who can actually hold a bat. Narine is hit or miss and Shubman takes his time. Either get Banton in for Morgan or just tell Morgan to open.,3
"Of all the people to hit bumrah for a six, its cummins",4
"Good lord, there are people seriously comparing the knocks of Russell and Morgan with Dhoni. 

For starters, both Russell and Morgan didn't have a Faf du Plessis at the other end striking at 200. And both Morgan and Russell did not deliberately ""not"" attempt to hit boundaries. Both showed intent. They tried. It didn't click. 

The two of them tried and failed. Dhoni did not even try. Quit comparing.

Edit: Dhoni was also batting at the shortest ground in this IPL, Sharjah. And he was facing a bang average attack minus Archer. KKR are batting against the best bowling lineup in the tournament on a big ground.",12
Cummins scored more against bumrah in one ball than everyone else could in 3 overs,7
KKR needs to reassess their lineup after this match,4
Cummins is a death batsmen not a death bowler,11
Ok cummins is angry is very angry with us....,4
Is Mavi Bradman?,4
Russell bowled better than Cummins and Cummins batted better than Russell today lmao,9
Mavi is a better bat than Naik it seems.,3
Let me tell you the tragedy of Nikhil Naik. It's not a story the KKR fans will tell ya.,4
Bring in the worlds best death bowler,3
"It all makes sense now, KKR picked Cummins for his batting abilities, he's clearly their best batsman against bumrah",11
Man..ruined the bowling figures,24
Cummins to Bumbrah. You might be the number 1 bowler but can you tonk me for a six?,9
High in the air..,3
10000 IQ buying Cummins for his batting,12
The only game in the whole season where the whole game was one sided,18
"Death, taxes and r/cricket bringing players into form.",9
Cummins was bought for his batting it turns out,8

angry cummins is the best cummins,8

He giveth He taketh,5

Cummins just hit bumrah out of MoM contention,28
Should have sent Cummins up the order.,6
I am disappointed that nagarkoti did not play. Hope he gets a chance soon. He is also a gun fielder and lkr fielding was not great today.,2
oh of course. cummins was bought for his batting prowess,11
Narine and Cummins for opening.,8
Csk's shitty batting isn't looking so shitty now.,3
OK Cummins doing a dhoni here,5
"First, Anthony Davis struggling to get rebounds and now, Russell failing to spank the ball. Today is just a bad day.",3

Poor Bumrah, lol",11

Bumrah took the foot off the pedal this over,5
Absolutely ruined Bumrah's figures. Didn't need to send him,4

Jesus fuck where was this fellow hiding?,3
Bowl Yorkers,2
"Ridiculous captaincy by DK, sending Cummins so late",8
LMAOO CUMMINS,8
DC next match is against CSK oldies. Better not fuck up the goal of ensuring outside top 4 finish for CSK. We are not winning shit anyway and this is more satisfactory than winning the whole thing.,4
So they paid 15 crores for his batting then..,10
Look at my boy Cummins go,6
Cummy cunts Bumrah for 26 runs lmaooo,5
INB4 they send Cummins to open next match,7
The stats won't show how good Bumrah was tonight,11
"For everyone criticizing CSKs approach yesterday, this (i.e. a 50 run loss) is what happens when you fail to analyze your team's position and play accordingly. No one likes it when team play defensively chasing a 200+ target, but sometimes, it is the best option.",2
Ah Bumrah's brilliant figures ruined,7
All it takes is one over and all your figures are thrashed by a tailender.,9
Omfg Cummins,3
Ok i m sorry cummins for shitting on u before...,7
Cummins is batting at a higher rate than he conceded at. The Cumdog finds a way,3
Isn't 16 too high for a T20 batsmen who can bowl a bit,2

Unpopular opinion: Cummins should really go up the order,9
"A good thing this innings tells us is that Cummins is good enough to bat at 7. So, they could consider bringing in another bowler for Naik.",15
They need to close things out to have an insurmountable NRR,6
"Haha, mah boi Cummins made bumrah forget bowling",12
cummins making abu dhabi look like sharjah,11
Bumrah Rattled,10
"Bumrah ü§ù Ngidi

Getting smashed by bowling all rounder.",26
Even the fake crowd has stopped cheering these 6s,20
They should've brought Cummins earlier,12
Remembering Russel almost brought KKR to victory during a similar situation vs RCB last season,9
In case you missed the memo: NRR does matter.,12
Loooool Cummins merked Bumrah there,14
Swinging six off Bumrah.. Wow!,12
This does put a smile on my face,8
"This just bowler cannibalism. 

Yesterday with Joffra....",28

Bumrah - I don't fear no man but that thing it scares me,5
Lmao those figures look ordinary now goddamn,5
damn bumrah sucks 8 rpo?,6
Hahahahahhaha,2
Cummins got inspired by Dhoni I guess.,9
Holy shit what the fuck were the actual KKR batsmen doing before this??,6
Pat Curran going well here,5
"FUCKING HELL MAN, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK",7
All the confidence Boom got before this over is now gone.,6
So paid 14 crores for his batting and 1 crore for his bowling then,10
"Sat sri akal ji , mein ek bruh moment report krna chaunva .",6
Wow.. It's comical now,9
Imagine if the likes of Russel and Morgan played like this,6
"Yesterday it was jofra against ngidi, today cummins against bumrah. Bowlers taking on top bowlers.",9

Is this the highest Bumrah has conceded in 1 over?,8
This is what the batsmen should have tried,8
Now playing Naik looks even worse,5
LOL wtf Bumrah,2
Cummins just paying off his debt from 1st innings,3
4 sixes of bumrah. I hope bumrah gets back to his best.,6
Cumdog's blue eyes mesmerized bumrah into bowling pies,11
Pat Cummins took Bumrah to cleaners. Peak 2020 this,16
Loool deano they aint got no chance,7
Oh so they paid 15 crores for his batting and not his bowling,14

Cummins should've come in a bit earlier lol,12
Is this going to another Bravo like game,2
Lmao wtf üòÇ,4
This looked like Cummins had a gunpoint to be the #1 test bowler and only way he'd do that is by doing this to Bumrah,14
"Cummins was able to do what Russell couldn't, hit a six off of Bumrah's ball.",9
"First 3 Bumrah overs: 5 runs

Last Bumrah over: 27 runs

Only conclusion here is that every batsman for KKR should be replaced by clones of Pat Cummins",35
This might be revenge for that one time bumrah hit cumdog for a six off the last ball of an innings,4
Holy smokes Cummins just hit a prime Bumrah off the park,16
Lungi Bumrah,7
CUMMINS PREMIUM has got many benefits.,3
Cummins is angry of course. When Saurabh Tiwari hits you for six your life has no meaning,21
Cummins making sure Rohit gets the MoM.,12
Just when I thought Bumrah is back. Cummings has ruined it all.,3
Cummins has scared the shit out of Pattinson!! Lol,7
Match is dead but come on Pattto. Captained him in my fantasy.,2
Cummins took revenge for the Six that Bumrah hit against him on the last ball of the India Australia game in 2019.,17
Cummins has done a full reverse Smith,9
Look at his strike rate. 300. Whew.,7
Man a Karnataka guy isn't sure weather to support KXIP or RCB,13
Bumrah is a great bowler but he seems to crumble under pressure. What‚Äôs with the full tosses and wides.,2
Cummins is the highest run scorer of kkr,27
NRR covered,7
"Wtf, bowlers are getting absolutely smashed in an over. Jordan, Ngidi, Curran, Chawla, Bumrah have all bowled overs conceding 20-30 runs.

Only 5 matches in.",13

"Ahh , so anticlimactic .",1
Cummins > Thala,9
"Never thought I'd see Pattinson bowl to Cummins in a fucking IPL game lmao.

Well Done Cummins boi.. Well done.. Brave..,8
Couldn't score as much as he gave away.,8

PJ Cummins c HH Pandya b Pattinson 33 (12b 1x4 4x6) SR: 275.00",4
Blasting bumrah apart is one of the best ways to show intent.,12

This is the problem, a generation has changed but KKR still want to play like they played 4 years earlier",8

Okay now I‚Äôm thoroughly confused by Bumrah‚Äôs performance and form...,18
"NGL, I thought KKR have a decent line up this year",17
Now can they drop for Pattinson for NCN if he becomes fit,1
Imagine conceding 5 of 3 overs against top order batsmen only to give away 4 sixes to a lanky blue eyed Australian bowler.,42

Cumins today showed more intent than my girlfriend yesterday!,9
"Bumrah hit Cummins for 1 six last year and had to pay back ""chaar guna lagaan""",12

What the heck is Kuldeep trying lol,7
I think fast bowlers are completely exhausted with the heat and the dew doesnt help. Thats why they are being taken for 20-30 runs in their last few overs.,1
20-6 ü§£,8
Cumdog looks so lonely :( It's prolly the worst dugout in ipl.,20
Bumrah brought down to earth by Cummins. Such a contrast in reactions from Bumrah . Lots of attitude after the Russel wicket and now he has no clue against Cummins. His facial expression during that over says it all.,3
Does anyone remember Professor Deano and his NDTV show?,4
we‚Äôre about to see 8 back to back no ball 6s,4
Man Pattinson is really good. But I dont like him diving here and there because of his injury history,6
QdK's keeping to spin even on subcontinental and asian pitches is underrated af,8
Hyped for tomorrow's Karnataka derby,15
Pattinson doing a great job as Malingas replacement,4
First Dubai victory paltan üí™üí™üí™üí™üëèüëèüëèüëè,8
Mavi cleaned up by Chahar..,4
Finally a win in UAE for MI!!!,6
Chahar too got his name on the wicket board.,4
Hahha shit. The Sunil Marine.,6
Pattinson and Boult have been a great replacement for Malinga this season.,7
Calling third umpire for this lmao,6
"Bumrah: *rubs eyes*

Cumming should open for KKR clearly.,7
DK looking really cheerful as if he hasnt been walloped,11
Til csk payed Piyush chwla 6.75 crore. Lmao.,9
Yes Chahar collecting important fantasy points,9

IPL Umpiring,5
MI finally win one in UAE. The streak is over.,6
"**19.6** Chahar to Shivam Mavi, OUT,  **146-9**

Shivam Mavi st &dagger;de Kock b Chahar 9 (10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 90.00",6
1st win in 7 matches in UAE for MI.,5
Was square leg asleep? No need for the 3rd umpire there,6
Our first win in the UAE!,6
Getting that first win out of the way!,6
"Such one sided game, this season is gonna kill the ipl buzz",-1
"So according to stats Chahar, Pattinson and Boult bowled better than Bumrah",10
MI vs KKR : It's free real estate.,7
"This is such a great bowling performance by mumbai, hardly gave anything away to the KKR batsman, they need a world class spinner to compliment their pace battery and make it complete",8
"Last entire season they just depended on Russel.

Even then didn't take better players

KKR really sucks",5
 PEAK 2020 THIS!!!!,8
Looking at Dhoni's stumpings that stumping looked slow AF.,12
"MI - 1

UAE - 6",12
rcb to drop to third :(,8
That nrr went stonks.....,11
Ah the mandatory loss is done. Now we are ready for some surprising losses,30
MI owes Cummins their NRR,9
"Last time someone hit 4 sixes off bumrah

They won the ipl

Dj bravo",13
"Jeez, they even won the toss",5
"This is why I don't play those fantasy leagues. 

Fucking Hardik Pandya will end with more points than Bumrah. Their system is very flawed",10

"MSD - 29 in 17 balls. Lost by 16 runs.  
Karthik - 30 in 23 balls. Lost by 49 runs.  

Still people are saying MSD's inning was bad, and Karthik's is good. This is what happens when you try to shoehorn emotion in the game.",9
"Bumrah has worst figures in 4 overs completed bowlers for MI, stats is a bitch",28
KKR is in a big hole now wrt NRR,13
-2.45 kill me now,8
"Amidst all chaos, ""Has anyone ever been stumped in the very last ball of an IPL match""

That's the first i guess.",9

KKR's nrr is -2.4,11
Ma RCB boyz tomorrow. Gonna be lit.,12
Would be interesting to see which kkr player has thr most negative cricviz impact score,7
"Now they are touching each other.

But presentation and toss have distancing , dumb acts",11
He was only around a meter out of the crease. Or as some people in my league would say: Benefit of the doubt goes to the batsman.,3

"Cummins gave 25 runs too many with the ball

But scored 33

So good day in the office for him",16
"Exhausted by the heat + dew.

Jordan, Ngidi - 30 runs conceded. Bumrah - 27 runs. Curran - 20 runs.

Runs conceded in the last over of their spells.",15
AREN'T YOU ENTERTAINED!!???!??????,13
Such a boring chase!! It was so boring. Bored the hell out of us!!,7
First win! After 6 long years finally!,5
That 28 run over of Bumrah messed up his stats for the match. Great performance nonetheless.,7
"Karthik is pised and insulted.

Say "" It's really hard man not that easy playing in the heat""",8
This match never happened.,14
"NRR: -2.45

Gambhir: I'm happy since they went for it instead of saving NRR like Dhoni did. Good job KKR, you might not qualify, but good job.",42
Dinesh Karthik being ethical makes Ashwin proud.,7
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/iy8uso/-/g6c0a67,0
Karnataka vs Bengaluru tomorrow. Epic shitshow is on the cards.,13
Rohit is giving fist bumps away to anyone he can find on the ground,12
I seriously thought MI would go on a longer losing streak this season as whenever they win their first few matches they end up not making it to the playoffs.,2
With that team KKR should have batted first,4
Boult is confused due to the heat,-1
"Cummins doing a Thala, hitting useless 6s when the match is lost after playing a considerable role in as to why the match was lost.",17
"Trent ""Tom Cruise"" Boult",2
Lmao what's with the fist bumps,2
"We shouldn't have let Boult go. Rabada, Nortje, Boult. Win the toss, bowl first, take 10 wickets, win the game.",6
3rd class performance by KKR today,4
"Dear Morgan, these are not your flat tracks of England where you keep hitting and think you're invincible. Gotta adapt quickly here.",21
[removed],-7
"Danny telling every one to have a shower, must have had a really stinky day in the heat himself",-2
most boring match of this year IPL,-6
Tomorrow - RCB vs KIXP,1
Isn't social distancing basically a joke during presentation? Everyone huddles around everyone during discussions and after a wicket but you do a fist bump instead of high five? How effective is this really gonna be?,8
Chennai's loss doesn't look so bad now. Who knew that NRR actually matters from the 1st match ?,12
I forgot that MI had a losing streak in UAE back in 2014,2
That was a nice NRR boost wow,2
"This match was a bit tedious, dull, boring and not very much exciting.",5
The net run rate of KKR is in a deep hole atm,5
Top of the table already üòä,4
Tomorrow is Team Kannadigas vs team of Karnataka,8
"Backing memes xi punjab tom

Want Ab de to make 100 n rcb to get all out for 120",9
Back to back boring chases.,1
"Is it just me or KKR not the same team after Gambhir left? I mean, they were already struggling to qualify for playoff last season but still sold up Lynn. It's over dependent on Russell now. Narine was working only as an x factor. Once Narine's weakness (Bouncer) was revealed, he became a below average Opener. 













Their Bowling has been awful last season and this season. They mustn't have sold Lynn. He was still a top 3 player of the team. Eoin Morgan really helps in Middle order but he isnt effective. He is just a batsman. It shows how much Gambhir's Captaincy held the team together. 

















Not gonna lie, but i see CSK in an almost same position in the next few years. Mi also shined under Rohit only. The more i think, the more i doubt that CSK will be as successful team as now. But if you give it a little more thought,you will realize that it's a cycle, a good captain wins the League once or twice(Depending on Balance of the team) during his span. Then if the team is able to find his sucessor and a balance in the team, they go on to win more. If not, they go through a period of being average untill they find their next captain.














 I might not be completely true and their are always other factors affecting the game but it's just my head cannon connecting points between captain and the team.",31
Dhoni's strategy of going for NRR instead and ending with respectable total makes little more sense now,26
Fucking Cummins stat padding by hitting 6's at the end.,16
I thought the plan was to lose the first 5 games,39
CSK should have ended up as KKR. Their net run rate might have taken a hit early in the tournament but they could have held their head high for their intent,-18
"im glad this is not one of those 'win the toss, win the game' tournament. i hated it when it happened in cwc19. this keeps this interesting and undpredictable.",27
Whenever MI win their first few matches they end up not making it to the playoffs,3
I hope after the Cummins onslaught KKR doesnt play an extra batsman at 7 n trusts cummins n nagarkoti to bat at 7 n 8,1
"Not saying what Dhoni did was completely right.. however him hitting those 6's at the end wasn't JUST HELPING HIS STATS..IT ALSO HELPED THE NRR. 

Still Fuck you Selfish Dhoni. Stat padding by hitting easy 6's at the end.",15
This take your own trophy and certificate & pose awkwardly is cracking me up every time.,8
Rohit with his new cup for his cereals for breakfast.,8
rohit is 100% done with this presentation.,9
Cummins with that sheepish smile after getting that award lol,19
HAHAHAHAHAH pat cummins making more $$$$ today is ironic as hell.,23
Rohit and Cummins taking turns with the awards,2
"i dont understand what the difference is between these awards.

like, player of the match and then another man of the match. what even...",14
"Cummins 6's didn't matter. He could have got out for 0 and the end result would have stayed the same.

What do you mean the NRR would have gone down even more ? NRR is for players who lack intent.",-10
Is Ipl Rohit turning into India Rohit this ipl.,16
"So now that all teams have played once, its clear Delhi is winning the IPL because fuck logic!",12
These presentation ceremonies are always awkward,10
Did he just say koach vs kumble LMAOOO,10
"This was like the most predictable result

You knew MI will be back with a vengeance after the last game, and knowing their record against KKR it was not difficult to predict KKR will be the victims of their backlash.",14
These presentation awards aren't any different from those stupid Bollywood show awards,10
Included Cummins in The Fantasy team for his bowling.. Got points for his batting. *Surprised Pikachu Face*,41
Can we fucking enjoy one match thread without the Dhoni wankfest? FFS,44
So no one's going to talk about Hardik Pandya's hit-wicket?,24
What match is it tomorrow?,4
Intent wins the tournament it seems,16
"Only proves why Dhoni's point of not playing for a long time makes sense with this chase.Apart from Cummins (surprisingly),every player struggled with the bat early on,even Russell scoring 11 off 11 when 15 RPO is required speaks for itself.Also smart from CSK to protect NRR and not go for run chase after they knew their chance was gone,which is why probably losing by 16 looks better than losing by 3x of that.",-17
Mumbai üî•üü¶üîµüîπÔ∏è,10
I guess teams that win the toss will start to bat first now,14
Cant wait for the shithousery tomorrow,16
Imagine folks trying to actually make sense of Dhoni‚Äôs approach instead of accepting it for what it was: incomprehensible bullshit.,56
Tomorrow it's Royal Challengers from Bangalore that will be playing against Kings XI Punjabis.,19
Will be a superb match to watch alone,11
"Here's the thing: You cannot just score 30-40 in the powerplay when you're chasing around 200, that too on these typically slow and uneven pitches. That means you are asking your middle order/finishers to score typically at the rate of 13-14 for a considerable amount of overs, and start swinging from the get go which isn't easy and not really fair to them. You have to take advantage of the powerplay, even if it means losing a couple of wickets, & atleast score at the required rate or more, so that you have an adequate buffer in the middle part of the game when boundaries dry up, and your only source of runs are singles and doubles & the odd boundary, and finally setting up for your finishers to get 10-11 per over for the last 4. 

It's understandable if you're playing back in India on flat pitches and small boundaries, you can take your time since you know you can always cover up later, but the same isn't true for the current conditions.",42
"Dinesh Karthick and Rana should have carried the team,they went out too soon",7
"After string of good matches , here comes kkr",13
"I think Surya Kumar Yadav should be considered for the troublesome Indian middle order. He's very versatile with his position having been come down the order for KKR for a no. of years and then opening well for MI too. Strong on the leg, not bad through off side and unlike someone like Kedar Jadhav and Manish Pandey he has the ability for power hitting. The only problem being he's a bit on the older side but so are the previous two.",16
"Nobody's appreciating Thicc boii Rohit for his 80                   
     Dude played from ball 1 to ball 107",6
"With Boult, Bumrah, Patinson and a little bit of Pollard, MI probably has the best bowling in the tournament. I think they will be in the semis/finals.",1
