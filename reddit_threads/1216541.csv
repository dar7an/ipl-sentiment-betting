If Punjab win today , they will have one foot in the play offs and Rajastan will be the second team to be eliminated.

KKR will also be eliminated for all practical purposes due to their awful run rate.

2020-10-30T13:48:44+00:00,sxd827,Kumble made some tactical blunders this season but playing Gayle at 3 is his best decision. Don't know why some KXIP fans are against this. Gayle can still murder spinners in the middle and his biggest weakness is short balls at express pace. I am sure Smith will hold back Archer for Gayle for at least 1 over.,4

Getting out on 99 is unfortunate, these things will happen but it was a good ball, still feeling good. To be honest, it's all about the mental aspect of my game and that's what keeps me going. I'm enjoying the cricket the same way. **I'd love to have the IPL trophy under my belt, but still a long way to go. It's an important game for us. Want to win this.** I've been having fun out there batting with youngsters and it's a good thing. I don't know the record (about the 1000 sixes), I'm still hitting it well. The hard work and the dedication over the years have paid off. To the guys who I promised to get a century, I missed out today but in my mind, it's a century (laughs). We just need a win.

* All the top three teams lost to KXIP in a row
* KKR got wrecked by RCB and then wrecked DC
* MI looted 190 against RR and lost with an over and some to spare
* KXIP defended 126 against SRH
* SRH knocked the stuffing out of DC
* Eliminated CSK beat two teams with playoff aspirations

You can obviously compare teams on paper and say that all of these results were down to phenomenal individual performances or unforeseen blips. But to confidently write teams off and pretend like they don't know what they're doing/are incompetent is a mixture of ignorance and disrespect.

At its heart T20 is a lottery, and a salary-capped league will sprinkle matchwinners across all teams. Core and bench strength might let you predict final standings with some certainty, but writing teams off in individual matches is quite bizarre.",60

2020-10-30T17:47:11+00:00,I_tend_to_correct_u,"I’ve not paid much attention to the IPL before this year but a combination of lockdown, lots of England players playing and a general increase in actually caring about T20 cricket has made me really enjoy this season. I think I’m becoming a Rajasthan fan due to the large English contingent but I’ve enjoyed pretty much every game so far. The bowling of Nortje & Archer have been an interesting sub-plot. The batting of Rahul, Iyer and Agarwal have caught my eye and I never tire of Stokes’ mesmerising fielding.  
  
My scepticism is dwindling, if for no other reason than I have cricket to watch in October. I do find it fascinating though how players like Finch and Jordan were picked and players like Pathan, Guptill and Roy weren’t.",26

He held one end safely, which gave Gayle freedom to play like he did today without worrying about wickets falling on the other end. I mean for God's sake, look at who's coming next, Pooran either hits 50 off 25 balls or gets out early. Then you have Maxwell, who has scored 108 runs in 13 matches with an average of less than 10 & Hooda who's barely a decent batsman, and suddenly you're into the tail. That's it, they have 4 decent batsman all batting at 1,2,3,4 position and not one proper finisher. 

Not to mention, he faced 10 out of 12 balls Archer bowled in the powerplay making sure they didn't lose another wicket to him and Gayle didn't have to face him in the early part of his innings, considering Gayle's weakness against the short quick ball(If you have been watching dugout, you would know because Scott Styris makes this point every time Gayle comes out to bat). He also almost got out to Aaron early on the short ball, but Parag dropped him.

What more do you guys want from him lmaoo?",28
