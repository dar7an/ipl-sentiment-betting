"My bet's on RR, only for Lord Tewatia",6
"RR would benefit so much from dropping Uthappa, opening Buttler and Stokes and playing an extra bowler. And Samson at no. 3. As it is, Tewatiya, Parag and Archer are not getting enough balls. It’s not the strongest in the world but that is a perfectly serviceable 5-6-7 when your top 4 is that stacked. Not super reliable but all X factor players and capable of demolishing the opposition if they click. Plus you have Gopal who is a capable enough batsman as a failsafe.",4

"Massive game this.

If Punjab win today , they will have one foot in the play offs and Rajastan will be the second team to be eliminated.

KKR will also be eliminated for all practical purposes due to their awful run rate.

Leaving unless Sunrisers can win both their games against RCB and MI (current Top 2) the current top 4 will qualify.

TLDR : If Punjab win today we can almost say that RCB DC and Punjab will qualify alongside MI for the playoffs",4
This is the only edition where a match between these two teams can actually be exciting. 👏👏👏👏 script writers,0

Shane warne helping bowlers is just a myth. I saw RR's group photo. They wrote royal family in the caption and warnie wasn't there. Which means RR management gave no role to him. Fuck rr management,3

For the sake of RR win I am going to perform sacrifice of not watching the match.. Thats the best I can do for them 🤷‍♂️,24

I dearly hope we play Varun Aaron instead of Rajpoot. Aaron can swing the ball and bowl 150+ so him and Archer would work good. Gayle had trouble playing Saini's raw pace so 2 raw pacers would be a good option.,3

Kumble made some tactical blunders this season but playing Gayle at 3 is his best decision. Don't know why some KXIP fans are against this. Gayle can still murder spinners in the middle and his biggest weakness is short balls at express pace. I am sure Smith will hold back Archer for Gayle for at least 1 over.,5

"I remember then doing analysis on both Rashid and archer in different matches showing what makes them difficult.

With Rashid they showed him bowling his variations, and you couldn't see any difference in his action. So you actually don't know what he's bowling until the ball is actually coming at you. 

With archer the showed him bowling a normal ball and a bouncer, and literally no discernable difference. And at his speeds it's too quick to react for a batsman.

Just how much money did Cred devs raised from investors to be able to hire these many celebs for their ads,4
Anybody think RR should say f#ck it and bowl Jofra for 3 overs in the PP?,3
KL will start refusing singles to Gayle now. Such is Archer's form.,8
"Pls win rr.

On behalf of srh fans.",6
KL vs Archer is the real deal,17
Steve gonna get the Slow Over Rate fine lmao,3

"Rahul, Lara's favorite batsman of the IPL",7
"Ya know I don't mind us playing Lord Aaron as our other seamer, he steams in and bowls fast. Sure he's erratic but he creates chances unlike Rajput and Unadkat. And anyways if he fails Stokes can bowl his overs. And no I'm not saying this because he's done reasonably well in my Cricket Captain 19 Rajastan Royals save.

He was a little unlucky last over, almost got Gayle twice.",10

Shaun Marsh :(,3
inb4 anti-climatic six from gayle,0
Kl shielding gayle from Jof.... rip Tewatia overs,9
Arre BehenStokes!,3
I don't know why KL can't play his natural game even when he has Gayle on the other side. He has to trust Gayle to hold one end because more often than not he delivers. Respect the experience like MI does with Pollard.,4
"Damn, KL Rahul's IPL record is a bit naughty.",7
We truly are the most selfless team. We prioritize entertainment over everything else. Went on a winning streak in an entertaining fashion and now we are willing to sacrifice as it will bring the most chaos in the table,8
Ahh man wanted to see a full over of Gayle vs Jofra.,5
Makes you wonder why did RCB leave him.                                       Remembers our own history......no problem understandable,1
Welp that was underwhelming,3
We can't pull-off what we did in our previous match cuz it's a monster batting line-up what they have !,5
Taylor almost at a 100 in Pakistan vs Zimbabwe!,14

ouch. here we go,4
Don’t fuck this up Punjab.. we didn’t win yesterday for this start .. ugh,3
Gayle must be pleased that he doesn't have to face the demonic pace bowling that ATGs Jaydev Unadkat and Stuart Binny would've offered.,2
Jeez....I am not having a good feeling about this match.,2
Dhawan has had a higher SR than KL this season,1
FFS Varun with the extras,1
Paddikal has a greater SR than Koach this season whaaaa,4
Koach: Strike rate is overrated.,2

"Chris Gayle hasn't moved his feet since 1995.

His podiatrist is torn. On the one hand he's glad he isn't overworking his metatarsals but on the other he knows that the brick implants he injected behind Christopher's achilles will harden overtime.

""I'm still not sure whether it was the right operation."" The podiatrist grimaces at the thought, but insists that Gayle himself took ownership of the plan. ""But he was committed to it. I mean, I admire the guy for making a career out of staying in the same spot for 20 years. That takes persistence.""",5
"In Aaron’s fantasy world, this was an easy catch",1
ALA RE ALA GAYLE ALA,2
"Aaron is just a discount Umesh Yadav

And that's saying something",1
Predator gayle has started hunting,1
Varun Aaron bowling like I used to bowl in Gully cricket when I was 10yo playing with 15y/o,1
That was a fucking difficult catch tbh,1
Aaron is pretty darn fast. Fastest Indian bowler?,3
NO WHY THE FUCK NOOOOO man,3
"DROPPED THE IPL, SON",6
unacademy might be worshipping gayle whenever he comes to bat,1
"Don't want to sound harsh, but how are Aaron, Rajpoot and Unadkat professional cricketers?",1
I wonder how many wides Aaron will end up with,3
Holy shit that ball was high,8
THATS WHY BOTH DONT GO,3
Tewatia would have taken out his Ghoda by now,4

You know sometimes how you know they're dropping it?,3
Ball was higher than Wiz zkhalifa.,6
Fuck you Gayle why are you hitting it there right at the fielder. Settle the fuck down first,7
That's what happens to you parag if you forget your Assamese roots,0
Tough chance,4

did he say cowbunga in kings xi song?,5
haha ofc,1

Why was Uthappa so close and breathing down Parag’s throat,3
"If every Robin was that useless, Batman would've died about 100 times",12
That's what happens to you parag if you forget your Assamese roots,2
Lmfao if stokesy didnt take such a blinder id have thpught this is our lucky day,2
i am relieved for parag. i thought the other fielder was tewatia,3
Now watch Gayle score a century,3
Robbie shouldn't have come running up to Parag like that. Distracted him!,5
When they debuted I was confused between Varun Aaron and Umesh Yadav,1
It's always off-putting when someone runs into your field of vision during a high catch tbf,4
LMAO WTF WAS THAT DROP,4
Abhi naach na pan parag,4
"It's OK, Parag. Robin wouldn't have caught that either.",5
RR just dropped the match and an IPL qualification...,5
Gayle please wait for Tewatia to come,2
Robbie has to have distracted him. He was so fucking close to Parag,5
"That is shockingly bad 

Gonna stick 20 quid on Gayle to score a 50 now",5
Aye aye ron too scared of gayle. Keeps bowling wides and when he bowls straight it goes for the boundry.,1
of course those assholes are going to play only against srh now are they?,3
Weren't redditors wishing parag wouldn't dance? Y'all got your wish.,1
Pack your bags boys. We lost this game,4
Robbie already started delivering for the opponents 😂🤣,3
Now Aaron has run out of all his good balls for the match,8
Every commentator: Dropped the match.,4

Archer v Gayle should be coming up now?,1
WTF was Robin thinking,2
someone time how long that ball was in the air,5
[deleted],1
You don't just drop Chris Gayle.,4
Robin screwed up there. Straight forward catch if he stayed out of his way.,4
Brendan Taylor just got a hundred against Pakistan,5

4d move by the disciple to drop it so the lord has an entertaining chase,2
Tyagi boy is on Gayle's radar i think,2
Gayle gonna give Tyagi the Deshpande treatment,3
Who needs Gayle when you have Uthappa in the opposition?,1
Fucking hell. Uthappa you carrot,5

hope tyagi’s got some practice done since the last time he bowled,3

I don't think they expect any of the three to bowl well or win matches.",5
It started damn,2
"Love Tiyagi's run up, loading and action

Prime gully cricket material",2
Tyagi smiles like he knows a joke no one knows.,7
Can you believe Robin Uthappa is supposed to be the 'senior' cricketer of the two? He literally sees Parag and then keeps going. What an absolute joke,5
"There you go Gayle, fuck them up please!",5
Bounce him out. Bounce him out.,3
"Gayle gonna do his work. Just want KL to join in, will he today?",2
Random Thought- If a big batting knock has dropped chances it is highlighted but if an average bowling spell happens no one talks about the dropped chances.,3
That’s more like boss,4
You can’t afford to give Jofra another over because the other doobs would get massacred at the back end.,11
Tyagi gonna get the Tushar treatment,3
Gayle ran 2 there. He wants to score today and these guys dropped him.,10
Have a feeling Maxwell will explode today,3
O wow,5
wow we fucked yet,6

"Damn, outfield seems quick.",8
Wtf...... That went for four?!,6
How the fuck did that go for a four?,10
Gay for gay-le,5
gaylestorm is so much more entertaining when not against ur team,9
Aw come on man....,2
"Slow stream 

Time needed to get on reddit

But damn Aaron was fuming at the end of his over",6
That shot proves that Gayle is not a slogger. It is rare to see a player to play shots on both sides of the wicket with equal finesse.,6
You know that when Gayle perfectly places a yorker ball into the gap for 4 that you're getting fucked,3
I feel good for Gayle and bad for Tyagi..,6
"If RR had just one other pace bowler who could go at less than 8 an over, they'd be in the play offs easily. 

Jofra literally carrying the entire seam attack",3

How did that run for the boundary,6
"Not a great start for Tyagi

That Gayle drop is already costing RR big time",8

"Danny Morrison is honestly no better than Kartik or Dasgupta. Speaks out of his ass, makes forced jokes and says shit like “Gayle is a T20 specialist”.",4

"Chris Gayle to upcoming domestic Indian bowlers : ""I am death; destroyer of worlds""",13
Kartik Tyagi may have PTSD after the last two games. Feel for him.,8
Would be hilarious if RR manage to get a sponsorship from sextillion7thpower. Imagine Stokes walking out with that plastered on his jersey lol...,7
Cricket is also a game of psychology. Which Gayle is a master. Even before a ball is bowled the bowler is already scared of Gayle. And he wins the battle already without a ball begin bowled.,8
[deleted],8
RR really need one good supportive bowler other end.,6
"Excellent yorker to finish. I hope that Tyagi gets a few wickets today, he bowls decently but doesn't always reap the reward",13
If Smith has any sense Archer should bowl this over.,12
LMAO csk going to go all in on gayle next season,33
Unrelated but the Pakistan Zimbabwe match is literally on fire right now.,8
Rishab Pant has more time to learn gully cricket rules now that he's out of the team,7

Gayle: I am inevitable.,6
"Damn 5 overs in and already 1k + comments 


Lol last night's game was so dead on here.",6
"Damn tyagi, nice comeback",3
Yeah this is following the classic RR match formula. Archer gets a cheap wicket. Other bowlers disappoint and they score 170+,11
Good comeback from Tyagi tbh,2
Is robin into some spot fixing thing lol sorry that drop was bad,2
I didnt do anything productive today. I feel disgusted,3
38 off 27 partnership but they've hit 34 runs total?,3
okay fine don’t bowl archer great smudge just great,5
"Imagine if RCB kept Rahul and Gayle:

Poor Aaron though. He did really well to induce a few false shots from Gayle and should've had that wicket. Can't catch a break.,10
Is Stokes too injured to bowl? Genuine question,8
Why is every RR seamer other than Archer crap,14

That KL pull 🔥🔥🔥,13

We're losing this one,3
Aaron is gonna finish what he started in this over,5
"Warner and Bairstow : 1,2,3,4

Bruh,2
"Well now he is in mood too, what more can happen now",8

surely we can’t have stokes chasing a massive score two matches in a row... right?,10
"Rohit Sharma would be proud of that shot KL, smoked it out of the ground",12
uffff KLPD get inside me,6
I feel so bad for Archer,9
Rahul just plays his natural game whenever Gayle's on other side.,9
KL you mad man,5
Kxip to score 200+ and Wrap RR for under 140,8
KXIP all guns blazing!!!?,7
Might have made it in to the first row at the MCG. So yep pretty big hit,15
KL should never leave Punjab ever again,10
Reminds me of Hitman 2014,6
Love how Gayle has seemed to take a bit if the load outta KL Rahul's shoulder and lets him free his arms more often these few games,9
I think slower balls would work better at this stage. Both of these guys can use pace to their advantage.,3
RCB in trouble,8
Lmao Aaron getting angry like he's gonna destroy the batsman next ball but then gets hit for 6,22
Had no idea Varun Aaron was playing. Been a while since I've seen him,5
Jofra really has to do all the bowling heavy lifting in RR,6
Kohli at least has AB on the other end who he can share the team's burden with. Archer has no one,8

RR bowling during 2020s :- Play out Archer and score 180+",12

[deleted],5
Swann is in babyyyyy,1
KL 'fuck ODI innings' Rahul,3
That pull shot is the reason rohit is good friends with KL.,5
RR would genuinely be a contender if Archer even had some remotely viable support lmao,11
The only fielders who can be forgiven for drops are those who can make up for it with the bat,5
WHy isnt Unadkat playing? He is experienced and has more variations for T20 game compared to other searmers in RR squad. Did well against MI last season if I remember. ANd has done better than other seamers in RR have done for them.,2
"Great sound effect with the empty stadium, the chants of Boss! Boss! Boss! Echoing around the ground.",3
Just looked at Chris Gayle's stats. Dude has more T20 runs (13473) than FC (13226) and LA (13189). And he started playing T20s 7 years after both LA and FC debut. What the actual fuck,10
give back KL . Take Gurkeerat in exchange,7
good idea to finish off aaron's overs here.,3
KL is the son of my Geology professor and boy o boy how proud he would have been watching his son shine.,8

'Universe Boss' is such a cheesy nickname tho.,5
What’s Archer being saved for?,6
"In 2011

RCB lost 4 out of 4. Then sign Gayle as Nannes replacement and Gayle storm drags them single handedly to final 

In 2020 

Punjab lose 5 out of 6 and decide to pick Gayle in the team.

Win 5 out of 5 since then and looking favourites to qualify for play offs from almost dead position.

Almost 10 year gap and history repeating itself .

Only frigging Christopher Henry Gayle could do that",11
"Can't believe Jofra wears so many chains

Could easily bowl 200mph without them

It's like he doesn't even care",11
Rajpoot is a better bowler than Aaron...,2
Aaron could have had Gayle if not for Uthappa obstructing the field yet again.,6
Good luck to spinners,1

"Mumbai should try to get jofra archer in the mega auction if he is not retained...
MI's bowling will have no weakness then and he will enjoy playing at Wankhede",2
Anyone watching zimbaabwe vs Pakistan??,0
They are runnings two's!! Is this for real?,4
RR's bowlers and fielders basically undoing all of Jofra's good work lmao,6
What if Jofra requests to be released from RR and to be picked up by MI. Bumrah & Jofra bowling together would be a sight to behold.,10
Man Universe Boss vs The Googly Boys gonna be spicy,3

"On that Rahul 4, it looked like the seam was angled in but the ball moved away?",5
"Everyone says Jofra should be in a better team. But that just makes IPL imbalanced and boring. It’s fun to see those gun 4 overs by Archer, making the matches intense",13
Rahul will kill Gopal,2
"If they rid commentary of Kartik, Anjum, Dasgupta, and Morrison, honestly it will be a better dugout than dugout.",-1
Riyan Parag I dare you to drop a catch on Lord Tewatia's bowling,6
I love how Gayle looks so innocuous when facing a bowler for the first 2 deliveries,7
Really nice score to end powerplay 53-1,3
RR need to play out of their skin considering Second Innings God will grace this pitch soon,5
"Maybe it's a better idea to use Gopal (decent Powerplay bowler) to partner Archer in the opening overs, then use him Tewatia and Parag to dry up runs in the middle overs, with Tyagi and Archer at the death. That 3rd seamer is literally a liability atm.",4
Only way RR can win this IPL: Archer to bowl all the 20 overs,9
I feel like I need to apologise to Jofra personally on behalf of these bowlers,6
"Who plays leg spin well. Everyone says Kohli/ABD have weaknesses, so then who plays them well",1
KXIP underestimated M. Ashwin and overestimated Kaptain Nair in the beginning.,5
Steve brings a different bowler every match and every bowler keeps getting shittier,5
"Unadkat, Rajpoot and Aaron are playing musical chair for one bowlers spot. Each one conceding over 40 runs every match. 

Smith would have more success by bowling himself.",8
Kings 11 could have been the first qualifier if this was the scene. Damnnn,3
What is RJ Balaji's agenda against us. He wants a wicket so badly.,1
Surely they *have* to bring Archer back now? If Gayle is still there in four overs time it’s going to be game over.,8
Fucking smashed that Son !!! Wowoowowoow,3
Damn boi,3
Gayle what a monstrous BIG DICK six💦,4
Easily the most entertaining Duo to watch KL and the Boss,2
Gayle mah man,5

200 almost guaranteed,2
Who will throw back ball from there?,3
Wtf is Gayle made of 😂,3
2011 Gayle was in a league of his own. RCB were thrashing everyone in their way. Even beat csk for a change until in the finals they came prepared for Gayle with ashwin making him lbwed,37
That was coming from boss,3
Should just stop saying big side and small side when Gayle's batting,8
You get respite only for 2 balls from the boss.,6

I'm so annoyed by the fact that the IPL final isn't on a Sunday this time.,4
One six and Gopal is bowling defensively. Bishnoi would never,9
Normally I'd be enjoying the Gaylestorm but SRH lives are on the line. Gayle plz stop,6

For a sec i thought this is sharjah. Had to double check lol,5

It's proving to be the most expensive dropped catch of this season.,3

I remember Gayle dismantling Stokes during his 100 at Wankhede 2016. I beg for an encore.,8

"If Gayle releases his perfume, it should be named Blush by Universe Boss.",8
Gayle smashing the ball into the pitch like that has to be illegal. Going to make some sick craters for Shami & co to bowl on.,5

It's annoying and cringy to see Tewatia touch his hair every second,1
Tewatia with beard > Tewatia without beard,4
Come on kl.... Pace up a little... Plis,3
This game is nicely setting up,3
"There is no point in giving Gayle dot balls, he is gonna hit two sixes and stonk his SR up immediately after",3
Gayle truly is box-office. The fear he strikes into bowlers is real. Imagine your place in the team is at stake and you have to bowl to Gayle being 40 off 25. I’d cry I think.,5
"If KXIP win today (looks like it) and then RCB beat SRH tomorrow, then MI RCB DC KXIP all qualify. The last 4 games will be boring with qualification spots sealed, although the battle for Top 2 will turn interesting between DC RCB and KXIP (unless RCB beat DC too, which puts MI and RCB in Top 2 easily)

(In the above case, RR and SRH get eliminated on points and KKR on NRR difference)",9
"Maxwell whirlwind innings of 7(3) coming up, felllllas. fasten your seat belts.",6
"I don't care whether it will happen or not, I just want to see tewatia cunted. That's literally all I want",7
Yes indeed. Seagrams Royal stag is my favorite ‘packaged bottle water’ company ;),9
I think tewatia is decent bowler if not good.,7
Archer is the Crewmate and Chahar is the mini Crewmate,3
Stokes looks like hes gone from a full ginger to an Altroz-tinged hair colour in a few days.,6
Gayle is 41 and he has been the stabilizing force for this team. t20 goat. And he is batting at a different position.,10

"The more I watch young inexperienced bowlers getting hit after failing to land the ball in the blockhole, the more I appreciate just how fucking good Starc and Bumrah are at nailing yorkers, a few inches either way and its a six.",6

So Tewatia cusses himself now?,4
Age is just a number for few and reason to tuk-tuk for others,2
How the fuck is Gayle *still* absolutely smashing it at his age,11
Fuck,2
Hmmm....,1
Tewatia doesnt trust anybody ffs,4
[deleted],6
Luck is with Gayle today,4
Oof,2
Lmao. Gayle just has got all the luck in the world today. I'm calling a 100.,14
Gayle is sooooo lucky holy shit,7
Dropped again 🤣. This is so gonna cost RR,11
Why the fuck didnt Stokes call for that catch,5
Thank God,6
"I said it

I fucking said it...Chris has some sort of spell casted on him that prevents any fielders to get his catches",7
"Worried about putting the mockers on him but I’d love to see Gayle get a century, what a player",5
Surely this was Stokes catch?,4
Lord drops Boss?,3
I think Bishop is correct there but in KL’s defence he has been cost a few runs today because his running partner’s been Gayle,6
"Tewatia was a bit greedy there, should’ve left it for stokes",6
Mercy from the lord there.,5
Stokes had a better chance.,6
RR really aren't helping themselves,6
Tewatia dropping the ball. Will he hit himself now,9
"40 out of his 51 are from boundaries (4x4 4x6). Also, 2nd drop. Century please.",6
"Stokes would've gobbled it, another crucial miss",1
The lord works in mysterious ways,5
Lord almost had the victory over boss,3
'Twat'ia,1
So Tewatia should abuse himself now?,3
That was benstokes's catch.,2
Riyan Parag breathes sigh of relief,9
You ain't getting rid of the universe boss so easy,1
no *The Boss* celebration. He wants a big one tonight!,6
Okay who gave Chris Gayle Finch’s luck today ? Because I’m not fucking complaining,7
Stokes pull out game strong,15
What a farcical attempt. It was Stokes's catch. But this guy wanted the hero moment because he's bought into his own hype.,10
Lord is planning something big,2
"Another tough chance, but these missed chances are what cost games",5
Fuck that was stokes catch man,2
I think the lord won this round.,7
Stop messing up on purpose Tewatia! THERE WILL BE NO REDEMPTION ARC FOR YOU TODAY,6
Should've let Stokes catch it.,2
Tactical drop by Lord Tewatia to hit a century easily if there's a bigger target,10
Tewatia dropping catches ;,4
Stokes with a dive would have reached that. Still a  difficult chance,3
Universe Boss turning RR into PWI,9
Stokes calmly: benchod i had it.,8
stokes should have gone for that.,3
The bgm which they play when a slow mo montage comes is soothing to the ears ngl,3
Damn. These people gotta start making calls for the catch. First catch got lowkey dropped because of uthappa. Possibility of stokes catching this one was more compare to tewatia,8
Tewatia ought to stop being a one man army. It's costing them precious points now.,4
Gayle is a simple man and follows just one rule: 50 runs per dropped catch,6
Gayle has Dhawan’s luck today,2
"40 runs needed of the last overs. 

Pick two batsmen out of the following -


Rahane
Dhoni
Manish Pandey
Uthappa
Rayudu
Jadhav",4
Chris Gayle needs 3 more sixes for 1000 career sixes in T20 cricket,4
God Tewatia annoys the shit out of me,5
Good on these RR fielders for not getting the universe boss out,5
I wonder if RR plans on taking any more wickets?,6
Universe favouring the boss today,4
WHAT THE FUCK WAS WRONG WITH PUNJAB TO NOT PLAY GAYLE SINCE THE BEGINNING?,6
"Tewatia drops the catch.

Stokes goes down to him and whispers - ""*should have let me catch that you little shit*""",7
Stokes would have caught that. The bowler just got too confident,7
"You know what, bring it on. Let the GAYLESTORM obliterate us this innings. The only way we’re winning this is if it’s a gargantuan total.",11
[removed],9
"Nicholas ""Raghava Lawrence"" pooran.",8
Bhag BC - Tewatia to Tewatia probably.,9
Tewatia and Parag delibarately dropped Gayle so that they could have a target to chase down in the most epic fashion together,12
Gayle easy.,4
"For some Age is just a number, for some it is experience",6
Read an article today about how covid messes up your body months after you've recovered from the infection... makes me feel even more proud for Ruturaj,14
Chris Gayle and Kimi Raikkonen are the only sportsmen who were playing when I started watching sports and are still playing. Always have a soft spot for these guys. Both 41.,9
"If KXIP win SRH moves to 5th position. If KXIP loses SRH move to 6th.

SRH has a better chance of qualifying when they're at 6th position.

Ninja Maths. Is this the best IPL ever or what?",12
Why do people hate Tewatia?,9
Fielders not making calls even with empty ground.😒,18
Inb4 rahul plays anchor till 18th over and then gets out,11
Chris Gayle is mistiming every other shot and yet he is still there. He is probably gonna score a 100 today.,20
Tewatia dropped a couple to ensure Stokes' century last game. Now he took one for the team  again so that Buttler can hit one this time around.,13
damn no sound of the bat now.,2
You know maybe Lord Unadkat would've been helpful with his slower balls here,2
"Year 2050,  71 year old Gayle playing for Punjab, scored another 50 ball 100.",13
Rahul needs to accelerate,4
Gayle Storm 100 incoming! You saw it here first folks!,5
"If RCB didn’t win with Gayle, KL, VK, ABD. Man, then I don’t know when, if ever",16
I wanna see Smudge's delicious pies to Gayle,4
"I appreciate the fact that KL doesn't even try to push Gayle for doubles, because he knows Gayle makes it up with boundaries.

Kohli would have bitched.",10
So Gayle has 13.5k T20 runs and only like 3k of those are non-boundaries? Unbelievable,10
Tewatia has been brave and bowled mighty well to keep Gayle to just 1 six off his overs and even that chance. If only he'd let things flow and let the premiere athlete coming forward dive for it.,8
Heavy Bat TM,3
That ball was slapped; slapped hard,6
"Kxip playing like dc from the first half of the tournament. Meanwhile, dc playing like kxip..",5
An over full of singles,3
Stokes is bowling intelligently,7
That was brutal.,3
Never thought i would see 6 singles in an over with gayle on crease,16
Bro fielders are everywhere.,5
Stokes being economical? That doesn't happen often..,8
Chris Gayle really different..,2
If you are not on 100 by 12th over you ain't scoring 200. I predict 178.,2
KL strike rate is overrated Rahul version today.,4
"Holy shit Gayle closing in on 1000 T20 6s

Unreal",7
"They have to take risk and bowl gopal, he is their middle over wicket taking bowler.",2
Well bowled Stokes,2
Show Preity dancing to this song!!,3
I just can’t understand how he wasn’t in the playing xi from game 1,5
Is anybody else bothered by the fact that Andrew Flintoff's replacement looks exactly like him,7
"Okay,round 3",2
Tewatia lubed up,3
Wicket alert for me as well 🚨,3
Gayle 3 away from 1000 sixes in t20s.,3
I wish Gayle hits 5+ sixes in Tewatia's over just for revenge on behalf of his fellow teammate.,7
"Gayle: Age is just a number

Rahul: Strike rate is just a number",16
Gayle vs Tewatia celestial battle current score 1-1,6
Running between the wickets has been shit for Rahul with Gayle.,6
They really need to break this partnership. KL sounds too similar to Gayle so it's making the commentators more annoying than usual.,4
Does Tewatia actually turn the ball? Or do batsmen get fooled by the straighter ones every time?,5
Round 3 boys.,1
What else are you supposed to say about Gayle at this point? Incredible,3
"Tfw your 5th and 6th bowlers perform better than your 2nd, 3rd and 4th",4
Gone rr,1
Rahul get your SR up for Ian pls,1
You've already made it back into the test team bc,7
Many people r talking abt Tewatia’s batting but his bowling has been quite good. He’s managed to keep the batsman quiet,5
By the 14th we need to start launching. Tewatia and Stokes are bowling pretty tidy tho,3
"RR is what happens when you make all the foreign players as the fulcrum of your side, forgetting that only 4 can play at a time. 
RR don't have one good Indian batsman (Samson doesn't cut it) and zilch Indian fast bowlers. Right now their bowling attack is Archer and hope that Gopal and Tewatiya can stop runs.",8
What is it about tewatia’s bowling that Gayle is not able to put away? Serious question. Lack of flight? Pitching in right areas?,5
Bruh...... Pace up man,2
The lord goes for 2 or 10 no inbetween,8
Kl is making a fatal error batting this slowly when set. I'm sorry.,4
Trust in rahul he will,5
"Start hitting, ffs",3
I thought they r playing in Sharjha.,1
ARgghh yeahh daddy yeahh Daddy What a SHOT! What a BIG DICK SIX#998 💦,3
"Lord 'fine, i'll do everything myself' Tewatia",4
And I thought Gayle was nearing end of his career in 2014!,5
Dont think KL is going to step up his SR unless Chris gets dismissed? Thoughts,4
Time to go berzerk now and get as close to 180 as possible,2
If Gayle gets out then it's on Rahul,0
Gayle is taking the fucking piss now,3
It's that kind of a day for Tewatia,5
Damn lucky again,3
Gayle prevails over our Lord...barely,4
"**998** done, 2 to go",7
I still don’t know what happened to Rahul after 2018 IPL. Look at his strike rate in that season and 2 seasons after that.,3
4 lives down. 5 more to go.,2
To people comparing gayle and Dhoni's career at this stage. One guy has kept wickets and captained India in all three formats and the other has just mostly played t20 leagues in the second half of his career. No surprise that he is still smashing it while the other has not performed as per age.,6
Gayle vs Tewatia is now 2-1,3
KL has to up the ante soon,7
Gayle force 1,3
So much luck for Gayle today,4
"ben ""air jordan"" trying to catch it.",4
Cameraman playing with my heart,5
"Gayle's no longer picking balls, he's going after every one with intent. It's effecting his timing",5
Looks like he’s going for 10 this over,2
"Jesus Christ they used the stock-est ""burrrah"" sound effect possible.",2
Once again KL Rahul would rather bat for himself than the team total.,1
20 sixes for gayle in just 6 matches. Highest is sanju samson. 23 sixes in 12 matches.,5
"Even mistimed shots are clearing the boundaries, Prime Chris Gayle",3
Gayle stepped out of the crease😳😳,2
I just want to see a 30 run return on Tewatia. We would have had 1 extra win if not for this little shit.,10
"I wish Scriptwriters allowed us to fast forward their matches, ill just skip to after gayle hits 100",9
"Legend says that if The Lord takes The Boss's wicket, the universe will implode",19
Incoming: Gayle to bowl to tewatia,8
Tewatia checks a lot of stereotypes of a Haryanavi,23
Bruhhhh,2
2 away now,4
Why does jos buttler looks so dead on the field.,10
I haven't seen a more fearful sight for a bowler than Gayle stepping down the wicket like that,21
Chris Gayle will definitely go down in history as the greatest T20 player to have ever played the format.,79
"Kl is playing EXACTLY like that game at Sharjah where we lost. Fuck you kl, you've learnt nothing.",-7
Imagine if stokes played for New zealand,5
"Man, KL needs to start hitting now.",1
Is this gonna beat that VK - AB partnership?,2
Just realised KL rhymes with Gayle.,7
"Smith has seen Gayle hitting 175 while being on the field.

Nothing from Gayle can unfaze him now",10
"Gayle getting lucky today, not complaining",7
Chris will eventually end up being the highest six getter of this year's edition with playing half the games.,13
Chad Gayle vs Virgin KL,8
Smh stokes you're telling me you couldn't jump 20 feet in the air to catch that? Wow hes lost it,8
Come on Rahul . Get a move on . You got your spot in test side . Mission accomplished.,2
"Possibly unpopular opinion: This game illustrates why having an overseas captain isn't a great idea. RR desperately need an international level fast bowler (be it Curran or AJ Pye) to replace Aaron/Unadkat/Rajpoot, but can't because there are 3 undroppable overseas players and an overseas captain that you have to pick.

This lack of flexibility also hurt SRH till they picked Saha in place of Bairstow recently.",8
Cmon just let us get Gayle pls,0
this conservative approach is gonna kill the indian top order with how slow kohli and rahul play,7
"No Smith, tactics are not underrated. Leg spinners against lefties **is** a bad idea. Captains these days just go to extremes, either not ball leg spinners against lefties at all, or just say fuck you to conventions and go for it. A good captain should take the middle ground and make the changes accordingly",7
Papa just 7 more sixes,1
"KL should accelerate maybe now, pooran is sitting there and there are more Archer overs to come",1
Will KL carry his form into int'l cricket?,1
I think playing more franchise cricket than international has helped gayle a lot. His dispute with west indies board back in the day allowed him to focus on just ipl and then later on BPL as well as CPL. he's been resting since the world cup last year.,2
Nicholas Pooran looks exactly like a typical Hyderabadi christian.,4
Polly Kaka would have caught that.,2
I think KXIP spinners are gonna have a field day unless dew/Lord takes over. Anything over 160 seems defendable.,1
Looks like Gayle has lost his timing,-1
Archer is the rain in Atacama Desert,7
Leaving Archer 2 overs behind kxip should get atleast 50 in remaining overs,6
"if there’s no wicket in this over, 200+ total guaranteed",5
"KL needs to pick it up, or is the plan for Gayle to attack and Rahul to bat around the others til end",4
"Lets not gift a wicket to Jofra rn, RR are begging for it. Play it safe bois",5
"Net bowlers : I sleep

Joffrey          : I attack",3
"Bro fuck rr . Fuckers cant chose proper players. Fucking spent 8 crores on a piece of turd like unadhkat. Manoj,suck someone's dick.",6
KL should now hit out or get out,4
Field better rr,5
"Haha, Gayle has 20 sixes in 6 games. Highest is 23 from 12 games (Samson).",12
Jofra vs Rahul is one hell of a battle,9
"It feels like they’ve been going better an 8 an over, doesn’t it? I fear Pooran coming in and playing a knock like Hardik did against RR the other day.",6
Madlad Gayle on a mission to dethrone Sixer Sanju,11
This is the clutch over. If they get 7-8 without losing a wicket RR will go flat.,4
I'll be surprised if Rajastan limit them below 200,4
"Unlike other teams, KXIP doesnt have any anchors so it kinda makes sense for Rahul to be that. But the problem becomes big when he doesnt accelerate in the business end. Dont think he is playing for himself, but because the team needs him as the anchor",9
 OMG Gayle 20 sixes in 6 games,8
I for some reason feel like Rahul is scared as shit of Joffra,5
Jofra imitating the fielder’s effort lmaooo,9
"Gayle has 20 sixes already, only 3 behind Samson with 7 games less lmao",12
missile launched at archer,1
That’s a drop archer. Poor fielding absolute Dolly of a catch,5
Why are they going so hard at Archer? I mean they can afford to play him out here? Would be a significant tactical win.,6
bouncer,2
For everyone saying KL doesn’t need to be aggressive because Gayle is. How about both of them fire? Why all the pressure on Gayle. Look how Warner-Saha played the other day,8
fun fact - parvin tambe addresses dhoni as uncle,7
"been saying this on all RR threads, Gopal is the worst fucking fielder, no efforts ever. Play Mayank markande or someone else ffs",3
smooth sexy FOUR. Go Big Daddy G,4
I can't believe his luck,3
Gayle has been ridiculously lucky today,4
Unlucky for Archer there,5
So jammy,2
Man..... All our luck has gone to Gayle.,6
Parag is so done with himself lol,4
Archer who? It's all about Second Inning Shami today.,9
Wonder what parag would be going through rn,3
"I'm telling u it's the undies with the luck

Dhawan lent it to gayle, that's y Dhawan got out duck last time",5
nutmeg by Gayle😒,1
Rahul needs to go faster asap. For an opening batsman who's been there for 13 overs he should be able to accelerate,4
Dismantle the RR team.,1
I'm cumming on seeing gayle steal a 2,2
KXIP has done something SUPER NATURAL to get that kind of luck.,4
Comment here with all your reverse jinxes to get KXIP to 200,1
If you're not from Rajasthan/England and you support the Royals.... what's wrong with you?,7
SMUDGE YOU FUCKING.,9
"Quick two, I N T E N T ™",11
Wtf Gayle I've never seen him run like this,8
Gayle had sex with luck this morning.,7
Rajasthan all over the place. Let's gooo Punjab!,2
is that gayle or kohli,7
Rajasthan Royals more like Jofra Archer and some plebs,8
Now I've seen everything! Gayle CHARGING for a single,10
Damn scriptwriters have given Gayle huge plot armor.,24
🚨 Gayle has run 2 🚨,14
"Now Gayle is taking 2s? 


RR you are fucked.",55
What was that fielding lol.,7
GAYLE RUNNING TWO THAT FAST TALK ABOUT FUCKING INTENT!,7
"You know what fuck it, I was supporting Rajastan but with every catch being dropped, every edge flying for 4, and misfields galore, it's pretty obvious that it isn't Rajastan's day. I want Punjab to absolutely dominate from here on.",9
How can you let Gayle run two off that,9
Cmon Gayle pls play the WT20 cup also.,11
Haha. Well run Gayle.,3
Gayle initiated a second run. **GAME OVER RAJASTHAN!!!**,21
Imagine these two opening followed by ABd and koach. :/,21
What's with RR fielding today,6
Gayle running this two runs is a definition of intent.,18
Fumble. Smith has fumbled it.,8
Gayle runs bw the wickets better than pant,10
"With 7 overs to go, KXIP is at a very good position to accelerate. No escaping from the boos anywhere in this Universe :)",8
RR is fucked now,5
Loving this running from Gayle lol,8
"SunnyG said it correctly, ""High average and low strike rate ends up losing you games sometimes"".",12
Can't believe what I just....Gayle taking that 2. Man he wants that cup,44
How come Dhoni's struggling at 39 and Gayle is hitting sixes for fun at 41,22
Bhogle is fucking annoying. Get him out of the commentary please.,-9
"Gayle hitting 20 sixes in 6 games - Nobody bats an eye


Gayle taking a quick double - Everybody loses their mind",144
Round 4 coming,3
"When you field so shit, even Gayle jogged a double!!!",26
Time to up the ante KL,3
That two should be highlight of the match,11
The ball is sentient and it obeys the Boss!,10
Man I know that feeling Parag is obviously feeling. Batsman you dropped making you pay for it.,7
Why hasn’t shreyas Gopal bowled??,1
Gayle runs better than Pant does,3
Bhogle is so irriatating,-5
Gayle running 2s is real intent™ by the big man.,3
Is Gayle the Zlatan Ibrahimovic of cricket?,12
"KL Rahul is a fucking slavedriver - forcing poor Gayle to run doubles

Edit: Meant as a joke guys",6
Is it just me or RR seems to lack some comrade? Everyone seems to be in their own world,7
"6 overs which will be 1 over of Archer, 5 overs of rubbish. Rahul and Gayle set at the crease. 9 wickets in hand. Pooran and Maxwell in the shed. This could get seriously ugly",11
Gayle snapped his fingers before the match.,3
Curse of #sextillion7thpower,4
With the luck he's had today the stumps won't fall down even if Gayle sat on them.,9
We've been saying that VK and AB deserve that trophy. But here's the man who deserves it the most.,7
Smith  has psychologically lost the game for RR with the Gayle double,4
RR needs some good Indian players to build a backbone. But who will they get?,2
Is there a more unenthusiastic player than Smith this Ipl??,5
11 off Archer. We're fucked,4
Bhogle is unnecessarily popular. Doesn’t do anything special. He is just a nice guy.,1
That tactical misfield did not help much. Did it.,3
RR gonna gift Gayle a century today,8
The sheer entertainment value with his batting style Chris Gayle brings is irreplaceable,6
Kl to get out this over,3
Only one over left for Archer. 200+ looking very likely..,4
Nice leave by KL.,3
Christopher kohli with the 2,6
Cant listen to Bhgole anymore,2
"Still got 11 off Archer, great",3
Stokes bowling has been ok today.,2
Fuck the Altroz,2
Why didn't Stokes bowl before today?,2
Chris Gayle has a thicker plot armour than Jon Snow? Want to argue?,6
Bangar is just so embarrassing,2
[deleted],2
"With Pooran to come, these two should go big now",3
RR really need Smith to get back his form,1
I want gayle to storm a ball into that altroz window.,3
"Tbh I can bowl better than varun,jaydev and rajpoot.",6
When will rahul accelerate,6
Bangar. Stop. Please.,9
KL big over alert,1
"Sanjay: It’s the ALT-

me: *mutes TV*",10
Sanjay faked it so much that even he forgot which colour he likes on the altroz,15
Look at Bangar trying to talk over Swann about Altroz,10
Bangar cringe,4
"Man, one innings Rahul plays like Manish Pandey, but in another he plays like Andre Russell",5
kl 2with that 115 strike rate,2
The car sponsor meme is funny but nothing will ever beat the Big KFC BUCKET,4
Swanny's ruined Bangar,4
KL showing he wants to play for the test team,1
45 of 39 match losing innings already from Rahul,0
People actually think Warner is a better ipl player than Universe boss,5
Bangar screaming for the Altroz is so cringe,2
Gayle runs doubles only if it means he gets back on strike. All other offers can fuck off.,6
"Time to accelerate now KL, you’ve got Gayle at the other end and Pooran to come",1
KL is very consistent but he is no match winner. He lacks intent.,2
Don't say revving it to pieces. That's the opposite of what you're supposed to say Danny,2
"rohit sharma, kohli, chahal and dhoni go to a restaurant. the server takes the orders. 

rohit sharma - cheese cake to start with. a large pizza and a side of curly fries. i will chase it with coke. then finish off with a bowl of ice cream. 

Kohli - boiled spinach mixed with soya chunks to start with. Soya chunks mixed with boiled spinach for main course. 

chahal - extra large chewing gum, please 

dhoni - curd rice, beta. then kayam churna. then rub some kailas jeevan to my joints. then i will listen to *bela ke phool*.",1
"Nooo, wicket alert from Lara..",3
"Man, it's no point saving wicket now. KL needs to start hitting.",3
Bhogle was so irritating that I switched to Hindi commentary,3
"Unpopular Opinion: RR’s bowling attack has a lot of potential. They have good leggies, Jofra, Tyagi has a lot of talent and Aaron isn’t too bad on his day. 

Management needs to see if the coaches and captain are fully unlocking this potential",1
What are they waiting for with 9 wickets in hand?,2
Bro is this Manish Anna ?,2
Tewatia’s hair is so Haryanavi!!,4
"Unpopular Opinion: RR’s bowling attack has a lot of potential. They have good leggies, Jofra, Tyagi has a lot of talent and Aaron isn’t too bad on his day. 

Management needs to see if the coaches and captain are fully unlocking this potential",8
Why sanjay why,3
Steve Smith letting a senior get his everyday exercise. Good man.,4
Ooh! Lara has called a wicket alert!,3
What did Bhogle say?,6
[deleted],1
What's worse for you guys? Altroz gold standard dick riding or work hard that's my style yo Vivo phone AD.,3
Aaaah kl should go big. They have pooran maxi next,2
"KL's getting tired, or his gloves are slipping he keeps blowing into them, and he hasnt timed a shot for a while now.",3
Lara's alerts are lit.,7
Gayle's secret is that he drives an Altroz.,3
This is actually painful batting from rahul,2
Pooran waiting to hit some,1
Man I don't think we are getting close to 180.,2
So far I ve been on the Pakistan ZIm match thread instead of here and kinda wondering why the thread won't update also users posting off topic comments on that thread.,3
RR doesn't want to be in playoffs i guess,3
Gayle's score is Nice* but this innings has been anything but.,5
"Gayle Storm in full affect here

*cries in RCB*",10
"46 off 40 in a must win game, when Pooran and Maxi are in the sheds, this is pretty poor from Rahul.",9
I might die of happiness if Gayle gets a 100 here,8
Strike Rate is overrated,5
Brian is insane,11
God dammit Brian,8
All KXIP fans happy now Rahul’s got out swinging big,13
Just ask for new gloves KL,5
KL Rahul out oh no we lose,5
It's absolutely criminal what kl is doing there with pooran waiting to get a hit,8
Finally lord has taken a catch,7
Stokes coming to form in the business end of the season. Just what RR needed. Now just need to tell Tyagi what line to bowl. He is a good bowler just confused a lot,9
Fuck,6
GG yo.,3
"That catch was a mistake

They've just brought together Pooran and Gayle

Big oof",8
That's how Rahul is the orange cap.....,4
Catch that should have been dropped ffs,2
"Stokes deserved that.

To Rahul's credit at least he tried to hit big to up the strike rate.",8
Who here said Lara called a wicket alert. Wow,4
Shit innings to be very honest.,0
Lara called it.,5
Man that bowl was travelling. Thought it would clear the field but surprisingly not,2
"Okay boys

https://www.reddit.com/r/cricket/comments/jkvm3z/_/galug2f",4
"This could secretly be a blessing for KXIP, or a curse",6
Oh damn. It was time to accelerate,2
To think RCB could have had a batting lineup of                             Padikkal Rahul Gayle Kohli ABD is absolutely mental,10
Good for kxip tbh,3
Who is the best spin player for RR?,2
"**14.4** Stokes to Rahul, OUT,  **121-2**

KL Rahul c Tewatia b Stokes 46 (41b 3x4 2x6) SR: 112.19",3
Solid ODI innings from Rahul,9
To all of you assholes bitching about KL - there.,7
I thought he had hit it well,4
Feels bad to say but good riddance KL.,3
The fact that this guy was sold at base price after going unsold for 3 rounds while Jadhav was sold for 7+ crores says something about IPL decision making.,6
Brian Lara caught in fixing scandal,7
Makes. Things. Happen.,6
40 balls 46? Strange inning by KL. May be the wicket is slowing rapidly..,6
"Finally the suffering ends, probably for the greater good of the team. Pooran should come in now",4
"Marlon Samuels himself or his pr team has great job , shit is now , 100's of comments in match thread would be of sextrillon lame garbage",6
These Rahul innings really look ugly when he cant tee off later,11
Stokes deserved that. He has bowled well today.,14
"Two west indians now, gonna be a fun time",5
sR iS oVerRaTed,4
Big Brain Brian,4
Brian Lara definitely has the script. Always gets his alerts right,9
Dhoniesque innings from Rahul,3
"Gayle made his name in this tournament, is considered the best T20 batsman ever. Gotta be a bit of a rue to not have an IPL trophy after playing in it for a decade.

Like how much the WC meant to Sachin who is undoubtedly the top ODI legend.",6
Ok we are fucked.,2
Brian Lara the one true god.,3
That looked like it connected well,3
[deleted],6
Poooooooraaaaaaan!,3
"The pitch seems slow, bat isn't coming properly",1
STONKS,3
Do they ever switch the commentators?? Or is Bhogle going to be there for 40 overs AND the presentations??,-1
Mr Makes Things Happen,1
Pooran + Gayle!  phew,3
Lara is the best. Damn,2
I know he's been our best player but he needs to get his strike rate up . 112 is not good enough for his calibre,4
Orange cap performance,5
Tbh Rahul was kinda slowing the game.,3
"Maxwell will tee off today, you heard it here first",2
The tail starts now.,1
Great SR of 112!,1
Obligatory tuk tuk Rahul? /s,1
Let’s see what the two West Indians can do here!,1
Lara can see future,1
 Bruh DJ saying ppl to stand and applaud KL’s innings wtf?,3
"Rahul's strike rate leaves a lot to be desired. You're in, you're set, just get going. He made the same error in the last KXIP v. RR game, with 60-odd off 50+, and that was key in Rajasthan's victory.",3
I pretty sure you didn’t want that to happen if you’re an RR fan,7
KL stepping away might not be such a bad event at this point in the game,5
For fucks sake Rahul,3
KL put everything he had in that shot but he just isn't as strong as any of those effortless Windies six hitters.,9
Inb4 a run-out.,1
Stokes is a treasure,2
Gayle with discount gayle on the crease /s,1
The anchor isn't supposed to go out like that :/,2
Wrong wicket RR,3
gayle and middle order gayle,4
46(41) is not good tbh but I'll wait till both sides have batted.,3
We still have Gayle at least,1
Yeah baby the mentor and the disciple let the feast commence!,1
Needed a tactical drop on that one,5
Pooran and Gayle is going to be fireworks,2
A thick bat and bulk would have gotten it over the boundary,2
"Comeon man, kl did not do bad if gayle was firing from the other end.",4
"Windies vs Rajasthan.

Its time lads",6
I deleted my comment celebrating that wicket cause Pooran’s on now and I don’t want to embarrass myself,4
Rahul with a good foil innings for Gayle to be honest. People just expect everyone to go at 200 SR. Not the way to go about it.,2
"pooran and Gayle batting together, oh my",5
Kl koach Rahul,1
Pooran pls have mercy,5
First wicket for Stokes this IPL right?,3
"Out with a 112 SR. Can't say this is desirable, even from an Anchor. Hell, Gautam Gambhir, the anchor of anchors, had a career SR of 123+!",9
Lmao with these 2 in the projected score just doubled.,4
Mini Gayle is here,2
Ben stokes - forged in fire,2
"RR are in a hole now, because you can’t bowl the two leg spinners to these two huge hitting left handers, surely? Tyagi and Aaron will need to bowl.",2
KL trying to get back in ODI opening slot.,4
Pooran we need you to deliver,2
It's all for the good. Pooran must've been itching in that dug out.,1
Thicc ass boi in.,5
Where is Maxi? we want Maxi.,2
Great innings for RR from Rahul.,4
So we have smol Gayle and Gayle on the crease,5
Can’t wait to see the matchup between the two West Indians and the proxy-West Indian,6
"KL ""Orange Cap"" Rahul gone.",8
"Rahul did well anchoring the innings, now onto Gayle and Pooran",4
"Unpopular opinion:
I think KL rahul is secretly practising for the ODI series just like last year when he wanted to cement his place for worldcup",4
Not sure what to make of KL's innings,7
"KL doing his job as next keeper-batsman for India, by playing an innings like his predecessor.",14
Gayle show some #sextillion7thpower,5
if kxip end up losing it'll be on rahul.,8
Would become West Indian Premier League when Archer comes in to bowl,9
It's effectively WI vs Eng right now. Lovely to watch!,47
Pooran denies Gayle a 2,6
Have pooran and gayle batted together before?,2
Pooran looks like a genie,3
"Well Lara said , KL might go, man Lara and Sachin amaze me so much with their insights !!",4
Was pooran even born since Gayle started playing international cricket?,5
Lmao Swann with that Tewatia chant. Now it's stuck in my head \_Tewaaaattttiiiiiaaaaaaa\_,3
KL has been so so consistent. Great to hold the wicket when Gayle goes ballistic.,8
Gayle and mini Gayle,10
[deleted],-3
Pooran's running is poorer than the Universe Boss.,2
"Did Gayle just ask Pooran, why u so slow mate?",5
The real continuation of Gayle’s tradition would be to have Rahkeem opening the batting. The absolute god he is,3
"5 overs to go with these two at the crease and 8 wickets in hand, this could get ugly",3
I can't believe how well Stokes bowled,4
Stokes follow through = Jordan running between the wickets,1
"Please Nicholas, no poor-anning today.",3
They should change commentators. Cant listen to Bhogle for 20 overs straight,4
The fuck was Stokes doing?,2
England Royals vs West Indies 11,6
Imran tahir soul entered stokes for a moment,3
"Another typical Rahul innings. Unable to accelerate when needed so all the tuk tuk is a waste. Heck even Hooda can do this if sent to open. 

The issue is someone as explosive as Pooran gets to face less deliveries.",5
Even stokes can't believe his bowling today,2
Has the pitch slowed down?,1
Real KL (pre-2016) has finally come out of his twin brother's basement this season. He can't be the same guy we are seeing for last 3-4 years.,2
[deleted],3
[deleted],2
Clever bowling from Stokes tbh,3
I'd never be able to understand how is Stokes able to perform in pressure games almost everytime.,5
"V O O D O O

O

O

D

O

O


KXIP fall like pack of cards NOW....",-1
Kl is truly deserving of the game changer award,3
Solid innings lol yeah Darren ganga,1
Pooran is half Gayle's size but hits the ball as far.,5
[removed],4
Hope these 2 can close the game,2
Lmao a part timer bowling good shows how shit are indian bowlers actually.,1
Gayle is playing like this at the age of 41; but Russell ghosted KKR the entire season :(,6
"Idk why, I just can’t stand Amitabh on screen anymore.",6
Cunt him gayle,3
Gayle sama mala adopt kara pls 🥺,2
Anything less than 180 will be disappointing,2
Hooray Aaron comes back,1
Good over by the nervous laddie.,2
Lmao stokes was running towards square leg already,6
Where the F is unadkat?!>!?!?!,1
RR have bowled well in the last 2-3 overs. Won’t be surprised if we see a 25 run over soon.,4
Give me the cucumber -Brett Lee,4
It's west Indies Vs Rajasthan royals at the moment.,1
"Really, who eats this Pan Masala? Literally never seen anyone eat it. Is this a North thing?",0
"There might be another Kohli, or ABD or a Warner. But there will never be another Universe Boss. A legend off and on the field !",5
Kings are reaching 180 here,2
"I mean, it's going to be all slower balls, chris. whack em",2
You cowards Jofra is the super stricker change the cutoff,3
[deleted],5
I wish RR wins for KKR as csk did for all the other teams,1
Pooran coming in hot with 60(21),1
Jefi master (Gayle) and his understudy (Pooran),1
What will be the final total for kxip?,2
"Jadeja has been low key impressive this ipl

Edit: Okay Harsha",3
"I seriously don't get IPL auctions. No one bid for Gayle 2 times last auction, and KXIP made a joke bid",12
Why tuk tuk gayle,0
If Rajastan get Gayle now then they'll have a chance,1
Think KL's innings was alright . Gayle was going big from one end no need to take added risks. Also he didn't get the doubles he normally would've with any other partner.,6
"**Most Sixes in IPL 2020**

**Samson 23**

**Rahul 22**

**Pooran 22**

Kishan 21

**Gayle 20**

De Villiers 20

Hardik 20

Edit: Pooran reached 23 now.",8
"\_Gimme the cucumber\_

  


ಡ ͜ ʖ ಡ",4
Need at least 60 runs from here. RR have shown they have a propensity for chasing big totals.,11
Boss just casually blocking the balls,7
Gayle respecting Aaron wtf,14
Suchith will probably field for Gayle in the second innings. He looks knackered,12
"I feel like 175 would be a winning score on this pitch, it looks a bit slow considering the no of mistimed shots",9
Gonna need atleast 180 against this RR batting line up,4
Gayle revving up for the big finish,6
Bret Lee: give be a cucumber!!!,5
Rahul doesn't really accelerate mid innings does he? If he starts slow he goes slow the entire innings and if he starts a bit aggressively he keeps that rate constant.,8
"Those Samsung earbuds are going to go into someones ear and require surgery to take out. Never buying one of those, safe to say.",8
Chad Gayle blocking in the 16th over,17
Slower balls are the way to go. 160 is gonna be hard unfortunately,4
KL applied brakes to this innings. this looks like 175 now. could have been 220,5
What a SEXY shot!! Pooran take a bow! Smooth,2
Pooran is chota gayle,2
KL Strike rate doesn't matter RAHUL,2
Now rahul's soul in gayle and Gayle's in pooran,3
I would trade this Gayle for the Gayle we had. He's changed his game completely now. More matured and understands the pressure and game well,5
Should get another 60 from 26 balls.,1
Gayle and mini Gayle,1
"To be fair, Gayle was ""not so good"" when he was in RCB. RCB had no choice but to let him go. This is the new Buddha Gayle, maybe he introspected himself - no point in going after every ball and failing.",11
I don’t even know what to expect next innings from this unpredictable as fuck team,2
Casual six on 2nd ball faced,5
Aaron not learning from stokes. Bowl slower balls and force them to hit towards the bigger side of the ground,2
Aaron and Umesh just cannot go one over without a boundary ball. Is there an academy specially for that?,8
"Pooran is a beast, needs to come at over number 10",4
Chooran plays tasty shots😋,5
Atleast Rajpoot looked like he tries hard.,6
"My bad, forgot Varun Arun doesnt have the IQ to utilize what the pitch is giving him",12
Unadkat possessing RR bowlers in death overs,9
Ngl Pooran always keeps people at their edge of the seat! Our future is bright !,24
Pooran only thinks sixes,11
Pooran hitting 6s nonchalantly: I was a businessman doing business.,6
"Now I hate comparing but Pant should be playing like Pooran is playing, more clearly his pre-responsibility phase",9
I missed the cucumber thing... what was that about?,2
Pooran giving concussions both with the bat and the ball.,2
"Aaron bowled atleast 5 times better than Rajpoop, I would say keep him",4
Man KXIP should have got 200 the way they started,4
61% voters think Gayle is most fearsome. Rest 39% are brain dead.,13
"After all the shilling I've been doing for kl to replace Dhawan in the national t20 team, he'd better not continue playing like this",3
"For the amount of time KL and Gayle batted together, the runs don’t look to daunting. You would think if KL and Gayle batted more than 14 overs together, you would be looking at 150-160 by the 15th over.",5
"KXIP fans have become so spoilt with the recent wins that they are criticizing KL performance, I'd say he held it long enough decently leaving Pooran & Gayle with 5 more overs, I hope people realise how destructive last 5 overs will be.",9
VINTAGE AARON,4
"Fun Fact: Rahul Tewatia anagrams to ""A Wheat Ritual""",7
RR will chase this if it is 200 and fail to chase this if it is 160,10
🤦‍♂️ no ball,2
This was the ground to play Unadkat on,8
Lmao,1
Pooran is so good,2
Oh lol the one good ball Aaron bowls is a no ball lmao,3
Ofc varun wasn't going without an obligatory no ball,3
Brilliant,2
Gayle pls fuck with Aaron,3
"Of course, won't be an Aaron spell without a no ball",7
Varun Aaron is an idiot,4
No ball signal sounds like missile warning,7
Ah the Lord has returned,3
Tbh this looks like a tough pitch. The KXIP start seems like a bit of a blip,3
"Varun Aaron and extras, name a better love story",7
"Varun & no balls

Better love story than Twilight",9
"Aaron: Look at me, I am the Unadkat now",9
Varun Aaron wasnt as bad as his figures suggest...nvm,9
Hope they reach 180+ which is possible.,4
Obligatory 40 runs gift from Sir Varun...,9
"Actually a surprisingly good over, until...",5
What a SIX by Daddy Pooran💦,6
Yoo hoo!,3
"Okay Harsha ""Ethical Mind"" Bhogale",5
When u think he bowled a good over lmao,5
Varun just HAS to bowl a no ball,7
You're an idiot Aaron,4
"Poor an has to preserve his 6 hitting lead here, can’t trust Gayle with a few more games left",5
Lmao Aaron screwing up a good over on the last ball yet again.,8
That is the Varun Aaron we know,9
That was a brilliant over but then he bowled a no ball and ruined it,4
"wow okay thanks Varun Aaron, we needed that didn’t we",8
Ffs Aaron,6
100 off 4 overs coming,10
A seven run over got converted to a 14 run over lmao,10
What's your final score prediction.... Ima say 185,8
[removed],4
Decent over till that no ball,6
"Just when I was about to praise Aaron for dot balls, he does that.",5
"Remove Aaron, unadkat, rajpoot next year and just get 1 good bowler from the salary of all 3.",10
"If Gayle and Pooran are batting against Varun Aaron, every ball is a Free Hit!",3
Nice one Varun,4
Why is Harsha sucking Gayle off? Can he talk about something else for once,-1
Bowled like a true RCBian,6
Sixes over cover region are Windies special. Love it from the young lad,5
Replace the orange cap guy with Kohli in the rohit dream xi app ad,1
RR need 2 wickets asap :/,1
"Varun""i bowl shit and also a no ball every game""Aaron",3
Will we reach 170?,3
[deleted],3
"How cool is Chris Gayle though? 

He has a strip club set up inside his own house. 

Lives life king size. Universe boss. 

What a dude !!",4
Not a good tournament for the Aarons,10
Oof. He was not as bad as his figures might suggest,7
"extra 7 runs, we will take it, thanks.",6
"Was shocked seeing Aaron having economy of 10. Even the Gods were, now they've it the way it always has been. 12 Economy",4
Aaron finding new ways to fuck up today. A trailblazer.,3
This is Pooran's 24th six of IPL 2020. Lets see who wins the race at the end. My money is on Gayle.,8
Turned a 9 run over into 16 runs. Lovely.,10
Aaron sus,3
Rajpoot beats Aaron by 13 runs,19
Jiska bat uski batting - KL probably.,7
In what way Ankit and Varun are trying to compete,7
It's the cucumber guys,3
189 - my prediction :),4
Kya behen ka lauda hai yeh aaron,5
Doesn't the pitch deteriorate as the game plays on? It would be difficult to bat on this ground.,8
"*KL gets out*

Pooran : oh, no!

Pooran : anyway",59
The Varun Aaron Charity has identified Nicholas Pooran as the current beneficiary,10
Pooran: A C C E L E R A T E,7
Indian pacers have consistently let RR down,7
Okay this is now Gayle vs pooran,5
"I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. Free hits are too much of an unfair advantage to the batsmen. Extra run and extra ball should suffice, why the free hit?????",13
What was the most runs scored in last 4 overs in Ipl?,3
"Poor Aaron, he recovered nicely after the first SIX but screwed up with this no ball.",6
There cant be an ipl without varun aaron giving half centuries. Wondered where he was all this time,10
Varun Aaron to Aaron Finch,6
Is it fucking me or are more free hits getting hit for 6 this season.,3
Just when I thought Aaron bowled a good over,4
As someone who doesn't support RR i really miss seeing Unadkat playing,6
Lmao good job Varun,4
Aaron is still better than Unadkat.,9
What r they telling them ? Hit sixes ? Mofos they already going for it every ball,3
Varun was my favourite bowler once. Hurts to see guys like Varun and Umesh being so rigid to not learn some variations for T20,3
Anything over 190 will be a very hard chase on this wicket,5
Varun Aaron giving me Vietnam flashbacks.,2
How is a tiny man like Pooran able to generate such power in his hitting?,7
"Unadkat, Rajpoot and Aaron aka the father, the son and the Holy Spirit",10
"How can Pooran hit it for a six being that wide, while KL cant after getting into a good position",7
Is there a source on Pooran being Indo-Caribbean? Seems something people are pulling out of their asses,5
RR has left common sense in the dressing room,7
"Watching pooran hit those huge sixes is like watching Sheldon beat the shit out of the rock. 

We'd be laughing me ass off if it was a movie.",7
First time I'm seeing a justified  rcb player drop decision.,10
"I remember the hype around Aaron long back when he was debuting. He was the bowler who could bowl 150 plus at that time, sad to see him could hold onto his talent.",6
Is my moral compass off? Is it better to murder someone than to fix a match?,4
"Why yall hating on Varun Aaron, he almost got Gayle out in the beginning if not for that dropped catch and didn’t give away that much also while bowling to two attacking batsmen",8
Play out 1 from Jofra and you are set,2
When sanju is your best indian player in the team then why do they even bother trying to win matches. Just give the opponent 2 points.,0
Imagine if these two go berkzer considering Archer has only 1 over left.,1
So disappointed with varun. The moment I thought he did a good job then the alarm went off for the no ball.,2
Is the lady in Ajio ad supposed to be mentally retarded?,2
What the fuck is that vnext ad?,2
"Lic ad is the worst thing I saw today, but then saw the vnext add",1
Varun Aaron anagrams to 'a run an ovar',2
Gayle running 2s is PEAK 2020,3
Ishan Porel would have been more valuable for RR then he is for KXIP,4
What a Yorker,5
"Unrelated question, but for those of you who have dogs, are they indoor or outdoor? Had an argument with a mate with regards to this",4
Some players play only for money. There should be a rule stating that if a player doesn't perform well according to standards set by team then their salaries will be reduced by 5% per match.,-11
I think they will reach 185,32
"RR fix at no. 7, i they'd be there after the Auctions. You Can not have just Archer in the bowling",6
2 tyagi overs to come,6
Love Gayle's defence lately,2
Styris can’t say Ben Stokes without saying Kiwi Ben lol.,10
Lol quick single by Gayle,4
"It's mad that I see 1-17 off 3 from Archer and think ""he's been a little expensive today""",13
"Ankit Rajput , Unadkat and Varun LOL",9
"Tyagi's talent is ridiculous, just needs experience",18
"Nickolas ""XLR8"" Pooran",3
Gotta feel for Varun Aaron.. 47 off his 4 overs,3
"Aaron 4-0-47-0 is still better than Tyagi, Rajput and Unadkat. How did RR management expected to do anything with this pace attack.",4
"Samson missed that lmao

I know he was in but still",6
We need a 100 daddy,3
Chad pollard hit that first ball 4 to increase his sr from 198 to 200,3
"Aaron to Pooran 

Sounds like AnnaPoorna",4
Gayle hasn’t batted well after he go to that 50,3
"Imagine QD Kock opening with Pant. And QDK starting slower than Pant first but catching up later.

""Kock is no longer in the shadows of Pant""

""Kock is no longer hiding behind Pant""

I will see myself out",12
Lol how tf did Sanju miss that throw,3
[deleted],1
Tyagi wasn’t born when Gayle debuted.,33
Daddy making us wait for #999 😭,5
Sextillion7thpower,5
How many sixes for Gayle this tournament?,2
Maybe tewatia should’ve been bowled out here. He’s been okay (but earlier),1
Please line Tyagi up. At least 14 this over.,6
This is some good bowling,4
Has the pitch slowed down?,1
Man GREAT over so far,8
I kinda understand Rahul's sheet anchor playing style for KXIP but he better change it and go hell for leather when he plays for India.,15
Quality bowling,3
"Rajpoot, Aaron, Unadkat. It's like RR play musical chair and select a bowler per day.",10
What is this dhol sound coming again and again? Too irritating,1
"Kartik Tyagi anagrams to ""A Gay Kirk Tit""",4
Who do you think has been Gayle’s best opening partner throughout his career.??,2
139 doesn't seem to be that defendable against RR...,-2
"Fucking Rajasthan has to groom Tyagi
He's a young quick with potential 
Stop depending on overseas players and start trusting young Desi talents!!",19
Gayle turns 3's into 2's and 2's into 1's,7
Fuck Yes Pooran,3
Tewatia - Jofra - Stokes - Next 3 overs?,4
WOW just WOW. Pooran What a stud,10
We need a 20 run over now,10
Why tf is the DJ so biased towards KXIP man,5
"Ah crap, it was such a good over until then",10
it would be weird if gayle played 20 overs and not score a century,12
How the hell do u hit that for a six,12
"You have Mayank Markande a really decent spin option warming the bench. Haven't given him one single game.

Yet you keeping playing Unadkat/Ankit Rajpoot/Aaron who go for 50 or there about in their 4 overs and aren't even big wicket taking threats.

They have no one to blame but themselves. Nothing wrong in trying to bowl 10-12 overs of spin in an innings.",6
"Windies lad vs Windies Man 

For the Sixes trophy today",8
"Pooran is on 21 off 8

Rahul would've scored like 10 lmao",7
Another heart in mouth moment. I thought it was going straight to long off,4
How insane are Windies batsmen man,5
Rahul should've gotten out earlier,6
Is Kartik Tyagi going on the Australia tour?,4
Feeling sad I couldn't see maxi masterclass 25(28) today.,9
"Such a fine over by Mr.Tyagi, ruined by the six",10
Govinda's facial expressions 😍,1
Why are there two Gayles batting,10
Two good overs ruined,7
"Okay hear me out Raina would be a perfect fit for RR, they need a good Indian Bat also a captaincy material who is Indian. This makes their 4 foreign picks more flexible",5
"Pooran, oh you're trying to stop my 4's.. ok take this instead",7
Was that Maxi dancing ahahahahhaha,2
Hell yeah.,3
Smudge is thicc,1
Nicky P sounds like the name of a pornstar. Ffs Danny,21
"Fuck it open with butter and stokes, those are their only hope.",9
I feel bad for Tyagi. Last ball wasn't meant to be a six but Pooran is OP.,15
Maxi so cute,6
What was that noodles ad,2
[deleted],-9
Maxi is an emotion,6
I want to see insane batting from these two Windies magicians for the last three overs.,2
KL Rahul the Culprit again?,2
This KXIP reminds me of 2013-2016 RCB,2
Bowl archer ffs,2
What a shot,2
Ben Stokes Vietnam flashbacks.,9
Gayle century incoming?,7
Absolutely adore Maxi. Good to see him happy.,5
Maxi and Jonty.. haha such fun,5
Tyagi bowled really well,0
Hahahah everyone's laughing at the Ketchup Song,5
Sextillion7thpower is REAL,1
Stupidly underutilised Gopal and over bowled Aaron & arguably Tyagi,11
Our redditor lighting up the mood in punjab dugout,7
Maxwell there dancing about the fact that he hasn't been dropped yet because the team management is sticking with a winning team combination (where he hasn't really done shit).,9
"It seems this is not an easy pitch to batch at. 180 minimum should still be the target. Sanju, Smith, Stokes and Butler is a scary lineup",3
Maxi getting paid to laugh and chill,10
Gayle should start hitting or get out.,-9
Will it be a Boss 100?,7
"A slightly short and wide ball: appears

Nicky Pooran: is for me?",15
Fuck yes. Stokes has gotta go now,7
Ha ha. We saw that Maxi,4
Come on gayle get your 1000 sixes my man,9
Gayle tired from 2's. GAYLE SMASH!!,9
Dadddy please give us a hundred💦💦,7
This should not have been wide.,15
When Stokes does well he’s Kiwi Ben but when he doesn’t it’s REMEMBER THE NAME,31
Still think 200 was doable if KL had gotten out sooner,22
Madarchod rr management. You guys are scumbags,4
"You know with the amount of hitting,  it's still not that bigger a at all.",3
Nicky P wasn't coined by Danny. JP Duminy started this and Danny followed his lead.,6
RR easily have the worst management in this IPL.,7
"100 for Gayle,?",4
Give me the 100 daddy.,7
Lets go for a ton *BOSS*,7
Tyagi bowling two dollies per over after 4 good yorkers. Need to improve big time. IPL switch is not easy for even the best pacers at age group level.,4
"Why has no one tried going round the wicket to Gayle

Over the wicket and anything down leg gets the treatment",2
333*3 = 999,1
"Can someone tell me why Gopal only bowled 1 over, Tewatia didn’t finish his 4 overs (despite being economical) but Tyagi/Aaron did?",5
"Gayle at 999

One more six for 1000 T20 career sixes",8
"the pitch has slowed down. should really help shami, jordan and arshdeep and spinners",7
1 more . come on big man,3
999 sixes,6
One away...,4
I am waiting for smith post match 'we just got gayled' comments.,10
Pooran times every ball ridiculously well great to see,6
All hail universe boss,7
[deleted],12
Who the FUCK in KXIP kept Gayle out for so long!!,9
Gayle is the Zlatan of cricket.,7
Is it 1000 sixes already ?,2
Universe Boss is closing on 1000 sixes in his Twenty20 career. Awesome .,1
Is it even an IPL season if Gayle doesn't get a century?,12
Imagine how strong mentally you have to be to bowl to gayle and pooran at this stage,5
stunning catch by the Lord,7
Gayle in the past 6 matches has had more impact than Maxwell in the past 2-3 years .,3
Can we get to 180? With one Archer over to go?,3
Fuck fuck fuck,3
Tewatia,3
Can’t keep the Lord out of the game,6
The lord giveth. The lord taketh away.,8
What a catch,4
Tewatia trying to get those fair play points,6
THE LORDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD,6
All Hail Tewatia,7
Ben Stokes : Look at me I am the Tewatia now.,3
I don't like Tewatia,0
"Tewatia : *fine I'll do it myself*

Guy can't put a foot wrong these days",10
Maxwell's here...oh no,2
Hope Tewatia doesn't fade away next season,11
PRAISED BE THE LORD,5
Fk... There goes  180 chance,4
Oh damn it. That should have been a six,4
Stokesy STRIKESSS,6
Tewatia 🤩😍🤩,4
Ben Stokes got 2 wickets this match dude that's insane,9
That was a good catch. Probably saved 10 runs for RR.,3
"That was a very good knock by Pooran, now would be about time for Maxi to earn his big bucks",6
West Indians Sextillion power no match for lord tewatia,8
Lord is a gun fielder,8
"Why tf is Paschim Pathak third umpire?

We deserve to see him out in the field",12
"The man, the myth, the Lord!",6
Sexy timing of the jump.,2
Long haired umpire is the third umpire,3
Dj giving me trauma,2
Don't offend the Lord by checking that refs..,5
Lord is everywhere,7
Will gayle get 100 here ?,2
Lord is like gayle cant have all the attention,5
I hope Maxwell comes off good tonight,4
Lord put his hand up and the ball went voluntarily into his hand.,5
Tewatiaaa pulled a tewatiaaaa,7
5994 runs just in sixes.,7
Lord saves us again,4
"Lord giveth
Lord taketh",8
Petition to start an “I hate Tewatia” club for KXIP fans,11
"Bruh Punjab might not cross 180, with all this hitting it looked like they were gonna cross 200",1
I hate it when theres a six off the last ball of an over. Instead of a replay I have to watch Dravid look real uncomfortable on camera,7
Inb4 Maxwell 1(4),3
I fucking loathe Tewatia and his stupid face,7
Why aren't the selectors taking Pooran to the Australian tour? Fascist Kohli smh,16
"Imagine maxi starts smacking from the first ball

Too much to expect? Meh...",5
That's gonna reduce our score down by at least 20 runs,9
There goes our hope of scoring 175+,5
"**17.6** Stokes to Pooran, OUT, Tewatia with another smart boundary catch. He has been so safe on the fens this year. Slower ball, short, around off, and Pooran takes on the short boundary. Tewatia leaps a little to take this overhead. Right at the edge of the boundary **162-3**

N Pooran c Tewatia b Stokes 22 (10b 0x4 3x6) SR: 220.00",2
"Chris Gayle anagrams to ""Chase Girly""

LOL",1
STOKES AGAIN! brilliant,2
Praise the Lord!,4
Just imagine the self confidence and belief Gayle has. The man Endorses the tag Universe Boss and still keeps on performing.,13
Man I wish we got to see more of Butler. Has been invisible so far,2
Lord fucking up punjab since 2020,3
I FUCKING HATE YOU TEWATIA FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUJJJ,17
The stage is set for the Lord to do this thing.,3
Tewatia!!!,2
Umpire dare to doubt Lord,2
Maxwell don't tuk tuk please,2
This sub hates tewatia one minute and the next calls him great.,3
Need atleast 180 here,1
Ughhh maxwell??,2
The Lord has 7tillionthSexPower,2
Man I wish KXIP makes it to qualifiers just so we can see more of Gayle batting. Who knows when we will see him play again after this IPL.,3
Gayle running two runs and stokes being economical. We are living in strange times...,6
"I'm gonna go cry in a corner, anybody wanna join?",1
Pooran went away to find out Shalu's identity.,3

Imagine if maxwell comes to form now,7
Why are they sending an offspinner so early ?,8
Time to earn your pay 😉 Maxwell!!,4
Can someone explain to me who's brain dead decision it was to show 4s in red but 6s in gray?,5
Lordy Lord,3
Maxwell pls do something today,3
Tuk tuk maxwell,3
How much did Tewatia sell for again?,3
Gayle century incoming?,1
Hey I am back from my ban what have i missed?,2
Come on Maxi. Redeem your batting today.,3
"Like styris said, What is the point of a soft signal?",4
Maxi gonna finally hit 1 today.,1
Fuck sake. I've just put the game on and realised I've been missing the absolutely lethal combo of Chris Gayle and Danny Morrison,2
no ball no ball,3
I want Tawatia/RR to fail so Swann can shut the fuck up.,3
Lmaooooooooooooo,4
Big show.is here,2
Oh no,2
MAXWELL BACK IN FORM GUYS,10
Maxi boi joining the party as well,2
Has Maxwell hit a six yet?,2
400 SR Maxi,2
Perfect start for Maxwell,4
999 career sixes and 0 sixes this IPL batting together,1
Not a no ball.,1
Tyagi :fine I shall give 180 myself,2
Aw man... Feeling sad for Tyagi....,2
Maxi amused himself with that 4,0
Surely a no ball.,2
Big opportunity for Maxwell here,2
"Free hit for Maxwell, great time to regain confidence

EDIT: fuck me",3
Man why can’t RR just play Markande ahead of Aaron and just play 3 spinners,5
400 SR                                                                                                       Maxi Probably- ab bol na lawde,6
Third umpire judged a catch without using 38484939 different angles? I cant believe my eyes,6
Poor Tyagi. Such a great potential! Hope he comes back stronger next season.,6
"If Maxwell doesn't hit six on a free hit, he never will.",3
"I’ve always wondered, what is the reason Maxwell changed his stance?",4
Third umpire judged a catch without using 38484939 different angles? I cant believe my eyes,5
I don't know jackshit about technique but that stance sucks ass,10
Was not that high,2
"No one WANTS to perform badly. Go maxi, show us what you got!",4
Gayle hasn't won a IPL right? About time he wins one with KXIP.,4
Okay Maxwell back being piss,4
Tyagi looks like an anime character!,4
"Lmao Maxwell, still no six",6
Please Maxi please.,1
Bit of a harsh no ball imo,2
Maxwell you cunt. That's what happens when your stance is way past leg stump,3
In that stance you can't hit a wide yorker maxi.,4
"If Maxwell can bat half as well as he does for Australia, KXIP have the best middle order in all of IPL
Gayle - Pooran - Maxwell

Also they have the best openers in IPL in Mayank and KL",3
Hit a six ..maxi,2
Karthik should use his time and learn from archer.,5
"The Universe Boss doesn’t even jog for a single, he just strolls/walks at a snails pace to the other end",4
"Seems kinda unfair to bowl a debutant young pacer at the death, that too against the likes of Gayle/Pooran. Why is Aaron/Rajpoot in the team",3
match fixed hai,0
Maxi is gonna hit his first 6 today..,6
Play your natural game maxwell you dense fuck,3
Indian bowlers have no brains sometimes,-2
I 100% expected that from Maxwell.,8
Lara is so done with Maxwell,13
Inb4 Rr will bring Maxwell into form who will carry the team to finals where mumbai will trash them left right and centre..,3
Maxwell just can't hit one out of the middle,2
Has maxwell hit a 6 yet this tournament?,2
This IPL needs a Gayle 100 please.,5
NVM,1
Wtf is this stance. Like what is he even facing?,1
"In form Gayle? In form Maxi hitting boundaries? 

What year is this? 😍",0
For fucks sake Maxwell,5
Only maxwell will go for that shot on a free hit,9
H I T  A  S I X  M A X I,1
Yeah Maxi's open stance isn't helping him here,3
"Wasting balls, Maxi",5
fuck me,2
Missing the free hit. Just Maxi things,10
Free hit barbaad bc,5
What a talent Tyagi is btw!!,2
Maxi fking stance tho.......... Missing all the offside balls,3
abe pen-thief Maxwell; give strike to Big Daddy,2
Maxi trying every shit shot to get it out of system just before the series with India starts,4
That was timed nicely by Maxi. I think this may be it.,2
Maxwell is useless,1
Maxwell stance only works if someone bowls it at the stumps or his body. Anything out of offstump he will either mis or will be a mishit,6
Maxwell has been so poor in IPL for the tag he carries. Played IPL for 8 years and has reached 1500 runs now,6
Wtf is his problem,2
Lmao no intention to even touch the ball,1
Whatchu doin Maxi bro 🥺,0
180-190?,1
Ye kis bhram me ji rahe ho parth.,3
"Dc need to win one more game and they’re playing against Mumbai tmrw, big yikes",2
Wtf Maxwell,3
So 180 enough today?,2
Maxwell looking at gloves is me looking at my paper during my exams when I am clueless af,7
So the ugly open stance is back,4
MAXWELL STOP DOING A MAXWELL,2
I'd demand a refund if my bowler bowled like that,3
Get Gayle on Strike *ffs*,2
I see the spark in Tyagi. He's raw but I can see the spark,10
Maxii pls,2
I think Mi will play with players who have been warming the bench tomorrow. Best chance for dc to get 2 points.,7
good recovery from Tyagi,7
Great ball by Tyagi,3
Maxwell has fucked his off side game with that Chanderpaul stance. Even Chanderpaul used bring his front leg across as the ball was bowled.,5
2 Missile SIXES incoming,3
This over was a 20 run over if pooran was there,8
Maxwell living upto to his expectations.,5
Lol still no six or have I missed one in earlier matches?,3
Fucking retard Maxwell,2
I feel like Danny morrison is a low key gay guy.,-4
Maxwell with the old stance would have cleared it,5
Any signs of dew??,3
Six #1000 by Big Daddy Gayle.💦,5
I just feel bad for Tyagi now.,4
Gayle goes back to the dressing room : there are 2 imposters among us,6
Abe kya chut ballebaaz hai ye maxwell. Kab chalega ye bhosadika ki usse pehele hum he bhude ho jayenge,6
That's 1000,4
Number 1000,5
Maxwell doing a Thala,4
Tailender gives the strike back to the boss,13
Maxwell is a slightly more useful Jadhav. Slightly.,9
1000 sixes!,4
Wasn't that a mishit?,5
Finally gayle just don't give strike to maxi,4
1 0 0 0,6
Spare the kid boss,8
I don't think Maxwell's stance is suitable for T20s.,3
I have seen everything,3
Lee so blatantly biased towards Maxwell. That barely went over the 30 yard circle and he got more excited than the fake crowd,7
"Man, that was some sweet chin music !!! Dammnn",2

1000 .. take a bow,7
How has that gone for a 6 😍,6
With Mayank in this team would be perfect,3
1000 sixes. What the actual fuck.,5
Tyagi bowled a beautiful slow Yorker last over. Why short now?!,4
1000s sixes from Gayle. Truly a boss. I mean Universe Boss.,3
fucking tyagi giving bouncers ffs wtfff,3
My god. What was that...,6
"1k sixes 

Leh me :- ye ek janam ke hain",9
That's 1000 for BOSS.,5
How the fuck?,5
"Whose stance is the best, Chanderpaul, Gorgeous George or Maxi?",4
why is maxwell roleplaying kachra this IPL?,8
1000 sixes.... wow,3
"Maxwell should really just try a more simplified technique, for a man whos out of form he should look to refine the basics first then build confidence",8
Fucking Maxwell,3
dafaq what was that shot for 1000th six,7
"Maxwell needs to change that stance, it’s not doing him any good, dunno when he’ll realize that",9
Does Gayle have a century every ipl season?,7

Aa karo wtf,6
24 from 6 balls please,4
How can you dislike the Universe Boss?,5
"Kartik Tyagi has worse luck than ""Bad Luck Brian"". Tewatia is hogging up his share of good luck.",4
It’s time to drop Maxi and bring in Neesham,3
Maxi has to change this bullshit stance and focus on his game. He's a better player than this.,3
I know this fuck will change his stance the moment IPL ends and smash India in the LOI's,7
He'll.not get a 100,1
"Maxwell - 4(1)

/r/cricket - *OUR MAN IS BACK*

Maxwell - 5(4)

The Universe - *I've corrected everything*.",11
Gayle’s a freak of nature ❤️🎉,4
"Smart from Gayle to retain strike. At the age of 41, he's seeing the ball better than 32 year old Maxi",7
Gayle 100 please,2
"Shivnarine ""Thala"" Maxwell",6
Maxi pls just take a single,7
Man that AA karo ad by Colgate is so cringeworthy...,3
Watching RR's Indian bowlers bowl hurts me,5
Man max has botched his natural game,4
Gayle or ABD ?,2
Why'd Maxwel change his stance?,2
"Glad The Boss is back on strike for last over, not MAxi",2
"Gayle officially has made 6000 runs now with sixes alone lol, that's more runs than half of people's carrers",3
I think nabi would perfectly fit in KXIP.,4
chhu ke daud kachra : gayle probably.,7
"Calling it now, Gayle is gonna be cucked from a century",3
Now that's what I would call sixthellion6,2
I don't think I have hit 1000 sixes in my gully,3
At 41 years of age too!,5
Go big or take a single Maxi,1
"Looking at Tyagi smiling after getting hit for sixes

  


""I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a fucking comedy""",5
I think Gayle might miss his century because of Maxwell.,2
"Legend Maxi reaches 1500 after 8 years in the IPL.  If you leave out 2014, he has 950 in 7 years. How does he get millions year after year?",7
I want to be mad but at the same time I can't help but feel happy for KXIP and Gayle.... Ughhhhh this game is gonna end up with me being extremely sad either way,5
Please god one six from gayle,6
Would be mad if maxwell breaks his six drought Against archer.,3
To everyone asking... Maxwell changed his stance to open up his leg side,7
"Its time ipl institutes a maxwell penalty, if a team buys maxwell, they have to give the same amount they pay to him to donations.",9
Can love machine Gayle take on Archer,1
What is this trash fielding,2
Maxi said they wouldn't change the winning combination when asked about hitting some runs today. He is man of his words.,3
No ball,1
Maxwell denied strike!!!,1
Gayle has 6000 runs just from Sixes,9
"Reminder that Gayle is at least 3x the player Dhoni is. 

And yet Dhoni is considered a legend. We need a higher bar for legends.",6
"Idc if kxip doesnt get 190 but imma be pissed if Gayle doesnt get his ton

That’s his second 99 in a consecutive season.,6
Oh Gayle no :(,6
Jofra you vandal!,6
"Rare angry emotion from Gayle, man I got scared for a moment there ngl",21
Even his bat throws go farther than anyone else,45
JOFRA SAID NOT ON MY WATCH,5
It's a sad day for rain.,7
Will Punjab lose a few FairPlay points for that thrown bat?,14
Fuck. Gayl 0 archer 1,-3
Deserved a 100 man.,16
Hahahahahaha,2
*pain*,11
That emotion even after playing for so many years across so many continents. Respect Universe Boss!!,15
That instant switch from throwing the bat to shaking Archer's hand lol,23
I can’t believe Jofra Archer just did that. Hol up,30
Gayle just pulled off a Tendulkar.,21
Bruh you just don't hit Archer for a six and get away with it.,14
KEKW,9
Gayle also had a 99 last season.What bad luck,36
Gayle just has a thing for multiples of 3,21
absolute peach from Archer again,10
God that must be so fucking frustrating,13

Oh no,5
Never seen Gayle soooo pissed,14
Even I feel bad :(,8
That took me a good two minutes to digest,7

Has maxwell changed his stance? He looks awkward and uncomfortable.,5
Archer 1 Gayle 99,4
Gayle is a delight to watch on or off field,5
Gayle be like - trial ball tha,9
Is nobody gonna talk about archers ball after getting hit for a six,13
Boss deserved a hundred there,2
Hukum ka Ikka BOSS.,5
Punjab winning this game but not getting any Fair play points,4
Take a bow!,7
When your crush says :i love you......................................................... As a friend,14
Shouldn't deduct fair play points for that.,9
So many 99s this season.,3
Would it have been Gayle's slowest hundred?,6
Damn that's got me sad I wanted a Gayleforce ton,15
That's probably the least calm I've ever seen Gayle look on a cricket field,11
"Ohh the anger. Good to see the hunger there. In the finals, my man",9
What's with the amar jawan jyoti thing gayle does after a good knock.,13
Will Gayle get fined? That could have caused an injury,6
Threw away the bat and still shook hands with Archer lol,13
Sachin be like not bad Kid,7

Seriously fuck Maxwell chutia,-1

WHY WHY WHY WOULD U DO THAT ARCHIE,11
High on emotions but respect for the opponent. Love to see it.,23
Maxwell is fucking dogshit,12
Must be too easy to bowl to Maxwell now,6
sometimes a 99 brings out more emotion than a 100.,24
"I have never seen Gayle loose his cool like that.

Now watch Maxwell take a 5-fer",13
"Man on 99 getting yoked like that.

All Hail King Jofra.",12
"Put some fucking respect on that name 🙌🙌🙌. What a player, what a man.",10
Gayle reaction was his realization that he can't play quality bowling,-27
Thala Maxwell,10
Oh Maxi,3
Man this is peak 2020,7
Boss gets out before a well deserved century. Gets emotional but still handles it better than the fucked stare of Dhoni.,21
Fuck you maxwell,7
What a player,2

Maxwell is so shit....,5
Do y'all think rr can beat this??,1
Gayle will throw his bat again when they cut his match fees,4
There was a dude talking about Punjab not being reliant on foreign players lol. Without Gayle they were nowhere this year.,19

"How fucking beautiful was that Gayle/Archer moment?!!

🙏🏏",71
What a moment! Gayle out on 99 and throwing his bat away. We'll see this moment in highlights in the future.,13
That's why I love this game. Good to see the players are as emotional for the game as we are.,8
I like how he instantly congratulated Archer for that yorker despite getting pissed off about missing the 100,23
"If sextaliion7whatever was Gayle's perfume, I would have bought 100",11
If KXIP win and move 2nd with Gayle out on 99...,3

Classic Maxi knock,8

"At this point i dont think it is Maxi's fault the management is sticking with him, so if he is not firing and still being stuck with it is their fault",6
At least Gayle got 1000 sixes,11
Words cant describe how braindead of a captain smith is.,6
Rahul cost them 200,3
41 he is 41,16
Tough luck Gayle. But kudos for reaching 1000 sixes in t20s. Absolutely unreal player.,8
It's just sad to see Maxwell like this,6
"No bloody way KKR deserves the playoff spot over this KXIP side. If that was to happen, I would actually be disappointed and I am a kkr fan.",10
Why can't Maxwell use the normal stance. So idiotic to stick to this stupid stance when the bowlers have figured it out.,17
"Maxwell, our expectations were low but holy fuck",14
Looks like styris is right about maxi's stance. Can't generate any kind of power and is very hard for him to reach for the balls around wide line.,6
Gayle is box office. Idiot franchises almost did not bid for him. Took a call by Sehwag to get him.,15
Deepak Hooda please don't take dot balls,1
"At this point, Maxwell is some money laundering scheme",13
Maxwell needs to fucking resign. Has had so many chances man. I’d pick Neesham or even simran singh over maxi.,7

Mumbai Indians will expose kxip batting,0
"very decent innings from KXIP and Jofra/Stokes, but now its SHAMI TIME",7
Two 99 scores in two years for gayle,10
Maxwell didn't even mean to score the one boundary he did. lmao,12
Glenn Dravid Maxwell with 6(6) finishing in style,5
This a great score but they're still 10 or so short with how things transpired.,5
"Of the 276 runs Gayle has scored so far this IPL, exactly 50% (138 runs) have come off sixes.",17
"Never seen Gayle so unchill b4, he got out or remained not out in 90s many times, but never so angry",9
I don't like this Archer fellow always looks dull and totally uninterested to play,-3
Let that be an example for people who say he doesn't care anymore.,11
Go to hell RCB. KXIP deserves the trophy this year.,10

"I hope Gayle gets banned,  what a disgraceful behaviour",-30
Kings 11 keeps playing maxwell in the hope of him coming good sometime but both him and hooda shouldn't be in the team.,8
I thought Bishop said 199*. It's not beyond Gayle.,4

It's nothing wrong to get out on a delivery like that.,11

"Piece of shit pitch batting wise. 

Can't see RR chasing this. 

MoTM tied between Aaron & Tyagi.",13
Guys it's not because Maxi can't smash 'em. He just doesn't want to start hitting now and jinx the team.,8
Did Maxwell suffer a head injury and forget how to bat? Looks so odd and out of touch,11
"Though that bat throw may not look very pleasing, Gayle appreciating Archer was a good gesture. Real BOSS stuff",14
"Pollard must be cracking up right now after seeing Gayle throw his bat.

Starc however, not so much.",9

I guess I was too pessimist that I was expecting 220+ target,4
"😭 wanted Gayle to be not out with a hundred  
  
klpd  😔",12
This is like a bloody sappy romance story. Heart in the mouth moment in the beginning when he got dropped. Make the bad guys pay and right at the end lose. Top level shithousery!,3
"What a humble and cool guy, truly the boss",11
Maxwell is the only player in the team who isn't doing his bit. Is there no batting coach in KXIP to talk to him about his stance? Just show them the clips from dugout every time he's got out,18
Glenn “Australian Thala” Maxwell,39
"185, still a great score.",11
Gayle only shaked hands with Archer cuz he is a fellow windies,6
RR's bowling attack is awful other than Archer (and maybe Stokes),4
How can you not love Chris Gayle?? Ever since he joined RCB I’ve been rooting for him. What a talent. Still better than 90% of the players in the IPL,16
"This fucking cinder block Orange cap is back in the scorecard

Just put a PNG for fucks sake goddamn it

This is r/mildlyinfuriating to me",14
"Maxwell's new stance doesn't seem suitable for T20s. It worked for him in the ODIs against England but there he had time to pick his deliveries. In T20s where he can't afford this luxury, he seems woeful",7
Just wait and see Maxwell smash India with that wierd stance.,9
Somebody just tell Ben Stokes that this score is impossible to get please. Inform Tewatia too.,10
Maxwell only player r/cricket memes so much but he still can't get any better,39
"Maxwell is going to hit form right around the T20 series back home, mark my words.",8
I didn’t realise that Gayle’s never won the IPL. That’s crazy to me,35
Simultaneously hated and loved archer in that Gayle wicket..,15
"Ok I want this man to take Punjab to the championship, what a brilliant knock. They get better after each game meanwhile we get worse after each game. What's not to love",8
"i remember everyone clapping at the auction when kxip bid for gayle in 2018, like they did it out of respect or smth. but gayle is far from finished",18
See ya next year rr,3
Gayle is so angry that he's going to open the bowling and take 10 wickets just like our coach once did,28
what is the (hypothetical) amount of runs/overs KXIP would need to win by today to surpass DC or RCB's NRR?,3
"Stop shitting on Maxwell guys. He's just a bloke trying to hit the ball, he'll get better in his stance. Critisize the selection instead",7
Gayle with the gray beard and bandana looks like an old sardarji,25
Even Jordan could have done a better job than what Maxwell did.,14
[removed],29
What a beast. 41 years old and playing with so much emotion and carrying the batting lineup.,39
"All depends on the DEW FACTOR, Rain Perera lite",14
"Kl is playing for orange cap, thanks to gayle and pooran punjab reached a good total",-3
Bruh maxi not hitting any sixes this ipl,20
"Gayle just wants an IPL trophy under his belt :(

Do it for Gayle Punjab >!next year tho!<",6
If Gayle says he scored a hundred it means he scored a hundred. Period,21
Off spinner should compensate with his bowling. His batting has been sub-par. Management should send him at 8 after Jordan & Bishnoi.,5
RR chased down 195 with ease against a much better bowling attack in last game. They have good chance if dew comes into play.,6
Neesham would have done much better in those 6 balls,2
Gayle hungry. Hope Kxip qualifies so I can get to see more from him this year.,12
petition for RR to open the batting with Tewatia and Archer,10
Any updates on dew.,5
Maxwell is dumb,9
41 years old. What a legend.,15
Gayle averages 42 with 148 SR for KXIP in all seasons. And they dropped him for half season.,10
Would have been 200 if we still  had Pooran out there instead of useless Maxwell. Fuck Tewatia,9
"Those who are saying he threw the bat, were we even watching the same game? He hit the bat on the ground, like we've seen so many batsmen do when they get out, and it slipped out of his hand. Not only did he congratulate Archer after, but he was smiling with his teammates in the dugout when he went off the pitch. He wasn't angry, he was frustrated at himself for having fucked up a deserved century.",54
Imagine doubting Christopher Henry Gayle,9
Neesham in place of Maxwell won’t be too bad right? Sure Maxwell’s been bowling alright but Neesham will cover that up with his batting too right?,8
Gayle deserves an ipl trophy,11
"Almost got the 1st part right. Now onto the 2nd. C'mon Shami.

Maxwell probably saving himself for the inevitable IPL 2020 final between MI and KXIP.,6
1000 sixes in T20 career? Are you shitting me? Call him Multiverse Boss,11
Can we agree that Chris Gayle is the best thing about 2020,24
"Gayle in T20 is like a Premier League level player playing in the MLS.  
Even when he's in the twilight of his career, the level of his class shows",7
Why was Gopal only given one over? Surely he could have been a better option than Aaron,5
Maxwell should play ahead of lyon now /s,3
I have a feeling that kxip is gonna make it to the final and maxi is gonna win it for them,6
Maxi you piece of crap..... now get stoksy in the first over,3
Just please drop maxwell. He needs work on everything and they're just playing him match after match. If we end up losing in the 20th over his 6 from 6 will be tragically comical,10
Maxwell might have played his last match this season,5
"Depending on which Buttler shows up, RR chances range from 30% to 5%",6
Time for a Ben Stokes masterclass.,6
Gayle's voice is different than I expected,6
"Imagine gayle throwing the bat gets gayle banned for the next match resulting in KXIP losing and subsequently not qualifying, that would be a shit storm.",21
"This constant push by gayle over his universe boss falls flat today, so many 100s yet crying like a baby after missing one",-25
Maxwell IPL 2020 Six Count: Zero,8
"Gayle ""in my mind it's a hundred""😂",11
Unpopular opinion (when it really should not be): IPL is Mickey Mouse competition so Gayle can easily smash it here for the next 4-5 years.,-4
Imagine selling gayle in the auction thinking he is past his prime.....,18
"Man,  really? No century?  :/",8
Gayle's interviews are the best. Completely wholesome,23
"Keeping the technical deficiencies aside, that new stance of Maxwell makes his batting look ugly. Smith and Chanderpaul has that tenacity thing going for them to make up for the weird stance but Maxwell's is plain ugly.",11
Maxwell is such a frustrating player to watch in IPL. You know what he is capable of cause his international numbers are just insane. Yet somehow in IPL he looks like just a shadow of what he is in T20Is,14
"*Virat Kohli hasn't scored as much runs CHG has scored through just Sixes in t20s*

Is the most random fact I didn't think I needed. #UniverseBoss",29
"Mods, please give us an “I hate Tewatia” flair",-11
"Why was Gopal given just one over? Bad wicket for spin?

Also wtf does RR have an unending supply of shit bowlers? Drop Unadkat and get Aaron in lmao?",17
I think RR can chase this down if they bat sensibly.,9
How many wickets will RR lose in PP? Options range from 3-10,5
Petition to redefine 99 as a “Gayle Hundred”,26

OMG 1000 sixes. What can you do to even stand in front of this guy man. True legend of t20 cricket. Will be remembered by generations.,12
"Could have easily been 220 if Pooran was there till the end, and could have been 160 if the Orange Cap played till the end!",31
I'd rather keep Neesham than current Maxwell in the team. Even as a pure batsman.,22
Uthappa master class incoming,4
It would be absolute scenes if Punjab loses to tewatia again.,2
With all that IPL success Gayle is just 2 crore worth and remained unsold for an odd season of inconsistency and Thala worth 16 crores.,9
Looked like bat slipped,10
Star Sports showing his name as [Universe Boss](https://i.ibb.co/dWHng6C/Screenshot-2020-10-30-at-9-19-19-PM.png) 🤦‍♂️,0
"Gayle is so underpaid. Even when playing for RCB he was kinda underpaid for being having the best Ipl stats, right now he should be getting more for brand value too. How does maxwell make 10 CR for example, when he's been bad for like 4 season now.",18
Live your life in Bob Marley way and play your cricket in the Carribbean way,10
Dont shit on KL talk about the man Maxwell himself.,11

If a wicket is taken on a no ball is it counted as a wicket or ?",4

"I don't know why every indian batsman turned into an accumulator over time. Pant is play like that, KL play like that MSD started with a bang and then turned into accumulator.",14
"Sucks for neesham, probably gonna go unsold next auction.",8

"100 SR from Maxi today? 😳

He outta form or something?",15
"Need Gayles mentality man. He is pissed that he did not get his 100 but also said in his mind he scored a hundred today. 99 is as good as 100, just one run short. If you can take it in like that and acknowledge the fact that you got so much right, you are a great!",36

"Given the KXIP bowling attack, RR have to produce something beyond the world to snatch a win.",9
Shane Warne must have really been a cricketing genius to win a title with this franchise,3
Maxwell should be not selected in the ipl auction next time even if he's the no. 1 t20 batsman,1
Maxi has just sent his twin who doesn’t even know which way to face when batting. The actual Maxi is chilling back in Australia.,9
"I really feel for Archer's back, it must be hard holding up the whole bowling attack",8
I think maxwell forgets how to bat when playing in IPL!! 😂,7
"KL, Mayank, Bishnoi/Shami, Gayle and Pooran should be retained by Kxip.

If (when?) Delhi fucks shit up and bombs out of this tournament. I think I'll definitely support Gayle winning this one with KXIP. You know they'd definitely win it if it was somehow a KXIP vs RCB final... Cause that ex RCB player curse would see Gayle hitting a 100 for sure.,9

"I think its only in the twilight of his career that Gayle's T20 credentials are getting properly recognized.  
When T20 began it was derided as Mickey Mouse cricket and Gayle's focus on it was considered to be silly. Its only now that T20 has become serious business that people have realized that some of Gayle's stats in the format (especially the centuries) will take a LONG time to be overshadowed",15
Maxwell's been very disappointed with the bat but are people forgetting he's become a very useful bowler for KXIP? Basically gives them 4 cheap overs up front game in game out,5
I want tewatia to score the winning runs to shut up the haters,-3
Why do I get KXip (dark horses) is RR of 2008,2
Neesham is playing?,1
"So what do ya’ll think, was this a display of good batting on nice balling conditions or good balling on a bad wicket?",3
No dew please🙏,3
Neesham getting scammed by Maxwell.,11
What all needs to happen for RR to get to the play offs?,1
Gayles been a cheat code for KXIP,9

Maxwell please change your fucking atrocious stance🙏,8
KXIP please have mercy. Or don’t it’s fine,6
Uthappa century coming up,5
[deleted],6
Wtf Gayle you went against the *script*. You were supposed to say that pitch will get slower and slower bcoz YOU BATTED FIRST! not that it will get easier to bat on,11
"The average score in Abu Dubai in this IPL is 163. The average winning score is 181. Out of 17 matches, the team chasing has won 53% of the time. The highest 3 chases are 196, 165 and 163.",6
"> Chris Gayle: It was a good knock, I thought 180 is a good total and it's a good wicket. It will get better in the second innings. Getting out on 99 is unfortunate, these things will happen but it was a good ball, still feeling good. To be honest, it's all about the mental aspect of my game and that's what keeps me going. I'm enjoying the cricket the same way. **I'd love to have the IPL trophy under my belt, but still a long way to go. It's an important game for us. Want to win this.** I've been having fun out there batting with youngsters and it's a good thing. I don't know the record (about the 1000 sixes), I'm still hitting it well. The hard work and the dedication over the years have paid off. To the guys who I promised to get a century, I missed out today but in my mind, it's a century (laughs). We just need a win.


We gotta do it for him.",11
Maxwell's biggest contribution today: Picking up the bat thrown away by Chris Gayle.,10
Really really hoping for Shami and Arshdeep to bowl well here. I believe in them.,2
Stokes will not go past 20 today....,4
"r/Cricket when: 

Indian player scores a single low score after a string of good scores : “You freaking Donkey!”

Maxwell underperforms yet again : “Acktually his value as a complete all rounder is ........ “",-2
Why not open bowling with our Purple cap enthusiast?,5
Sujit should be the sub fielder.  Remember the Pandey catch??,1
Gayle made his international debut in 1999. He's still scoring 99's in 2020.,4
RR have too many matchwinners with the bat man,8
Gayle and Ab deserves an IPL trophy under them before they retire from IPL... No overseas player has dominated IPL as much as they have done... Also they brought great value to IPL as well... If there's ever hall of fame for IPL made in future Chris Gayle should be the first one to be inducted.. He brought that slam jam cricket to IPL.. RCB SHOULD HAVE NOT LET HIM GO.,7
Here's hoping Uthappa goes back in early for RR to actually have a chance.,3
Go poonjab,3
Only Stokes has the BDE to combat Gayle. His wicket is the game for Kxip.,4
CSK bidding for Maxwell next season.,20
At this point Maxwell is a specialist bowler for Kings XI.,6
"Dew gods, not today please",5
"To know how much of a IPL fraud Maxwell is one must look at his international T20 figures. In the last 3 years Maxwell has played 26 T20I matches, averaged 40.52 at a SR of 151.27. That's how much of a dangerous player Maxwell is. Yet in IPL he doesn't even look half the batsman he is",11
Bloody love a bit of Jofra,5
Incoming 12(9) knock from Robin,8
It'd be not fun if Maxwell wins games for aus vs india,5

Wait why are there subs? I'm scared,5

Something about this Suchit .. he strikes me as a heck of a fielder.,7
Can't spell Sekxtillion7thPower without KXIP,29
Just find a way to dismiss Stokes early and the game is yours my Punjab boys.,5
Bring the keeper up bois. Play with his mind,3

Gayle and Pooran were just being your average West Indies",10

Maxwell ffs,1
Fortunately for stokes it hit the helmet. Otherwise would have balloned in the air,3
Kxip should lose this to make it more interesting. Ateast we aren't having dead rubbers at the end of the league,7
Maxwell is really useless except for Australia.,4
Fucking Maxwell,1
That was a great effort please dont murder him,7
Well Gayle said pitch will get easier to bat so RR holds advantage but a couple of wickets can change that,4
I really want KXIP to reach atleast to playoffs. Gyale you are awesome,7

Maxwell and the series of almosts,7
"For Mumbai the other 3 playoff teams of DC, KKR, and RCB would have been ideal since they seem to have the wood on all three teams. Kings XI and RR coming into the picture would be a problem.",9
Maxi sometimes behave like you're playing for the team paying you not the opposition pls,8
"Great score on the board by KXIP. But can’t help but wander if this is the lowest score in a game which Gayle has batted the whole innings. Never the less, Punjab batted well.  

Still think RR will win this.",5
Maxwell is proof of the charitable activities of the IPL team owners.,13
DC and RCB want RR to win right?,6
Hard catch but Maxwell batting sucks for now so folks will kill him anyway.,16
Maxwell just dropped the game.,9

"Good start, we are in trouble",7
Maxwell needs to bowl,2
Why do the commentators always have to maintain how good Maxwell is every time he fails?,4
"Yes, Uthappa. Don't let KKR get kicked out of the tournament yet! Remember all the good times we had? Do it for the old time's sake!",5
Stokes must be put on suicide watch.,4

Arshdeep and Bishnoi has been really the new found talent for Punjab.,8

Yeah KXIP winning 6 in a row was looking too good to be true,12
Oh this is filthy Stokesy,10
Stokes batting in easy mode,8
Kxip fans abusing mi to bring stokes in form,10
Stokes I love you <3,6
Maxwell is going into depression now,2
"You can take the rr away from unadkat but you can't take the unadkat away from rr.


 Unadkat goes, rajpoot comes. Rajpoot goes, Aaron comes",10
Why no Maxi yet? Stokes was shaking by the thought of facing him and you give him time to settle.,6
That's how you play in power play,8
Some really cheeky shots out of stokes today,3
These 2 will show that the chase against MI wasn’t a fluke,3
"""sextillion8thpower"" - Stokes",5
Does Ben Stokes have a kiwi accent ?,2
1000 sixes or 99.94 average?,5
"Spinner to Stokes in the powerplay, Ned",3
"Feels good to be a fan of a team that Ben Stokes plays for, right? 

\#sextillion7thpower",2
Is the commentating too dead or are they used to this Stokesy sixes,2
RR have already broken the back of the chase? Stokes is undoing Gayle here.,2
God mode Stokes,2
STOKES CAN FUCK ME ANYDAY,3
Sextillion7thPower six!,2
"*Experts think Stokes shouldn’t open*

Yeah right.

I am still waiting for us to open with Stoinis when it’s been really clear to me that neither Shaw nor Rahane was ever the answer.",5
Say with me bois - *Next year will be ours*,3
No fairytale ending? This is 2020 anyway. Was bound to be shit,2
Stokes has again decided to be a team's cheat code,3
BCCI should start allowing players to go and play BBL. Atleast players who have retired from International or are uncapped.,13
Samuels seems to be a RR supporter. He triggered warne and stokes and it seems like they have started to gain some form and made good decisions,6
"After every boundary Uthappa wants a fist bump, but Stokes says rehne de",9
Kiwi Ben on song,3
It was good while it lasted. On the flip side next season is only 6 months away,5
"It will be an interesting and close match, have faith in KXIP script writers",5
Get stokes now.. otherwise game over for KXIP,5
"This is the reason Bishy, that spinners weren’t used by RR in power play .",3
Lmfao still dying at that appeal. How is that sir lmfao,19
[deleted],8
Feel bad for M Ashwin. Hasn't actually bowled badly.,9
"Is rr playing for the nrr? 

Looks like clear intent from start",7
"Stokes is riding high in confidence after his century in the last game. If they aren’t able to get him out now, he will take the game away",8
When was the first time y'all took notice of Stokes and said Wow,2
"Not bowling gopal to gayle might have worked out for the best, smith shows his captaincy skills.",1
clasic stokes: presures on so he plays beautifuly,5
expensive over from Ashwin,2
So we stopped counting Stokes' sixes just because he hit his first one last game?,3
Stokes thought Samuels was bowling,9
Lord Stokes has no mercy,3
"Stokes 39 (19)

Uthappa 8 (5)",3
Stokes for T20 opener,3
Someone tell Ben this isn’t Lara cricket 07,7
Ben stokes playing  is a treat for a fan regardless which team you support,6
"Arshdeep, second innings God and Ethics are all getting spanked. I hate everything",6
"45(41) kl rahul
6(6) maxwell
They should have scored min 210",12
Fun fact Stokes' strike rate is 216 = 6^3,17
And I was like RR is fucking stupid they are sending Stokes to open instead of Buttler,11
That's Ben Stokes. Fuck yes. Unlike Marlon Samuels who was in Pune Warriors - the worst IPL franchise ever,12
woah,4
"I don't know, Rahul looks like a very controlling captain the way he is always criticizing his Indian players. He was literally screaming at Akshdeep last match. Guess he and Kumble get along well!",6
One thing I really like about RR is not take it deep bullshit. They go bang bang all the way!,2
If stokes attacks shami that would be fun,0
"KL Rahul be like ""Fuck Hardik Pandya for saying remember the name and bringing Stokes into form""",3
Smith just showed Samuels comments to Stokes before going out to bat,3
That's a cracking shot,5
Inside out. What a shot,2
Arre yar,2
STOKES IS FUCKING SUPERHUMAN,10
The display board guys missed a huge opportunity to write Ben Stonks instead of beneficial stokes,2
Ben 'Jos Buttler' Stokes,2
What a fucking shot,1
Just creamed it Ben stokes.!!!,6
I blame Marlon Samuels for this,7
"This is just painful to watch for me now , see you in the morning lads",3
"My Prediction.


RR win by 10 wickets 189/0

Stokes 162*(84)
Uthappa 22*(36)

5 extras",5
STOKESY CAN GET IT ANYDAY ANYTIME,2
And this bowling attack bundled out SRH for 114,5
"Sextillion7thpower


Sorry just had to get it out of my system.",3
"Stokes : Greatest T20 player of all time huh?  
YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE!",6
Stokes is treating Shami as a net bowler. RR are bossing this chase...,1
"Yeah RR still has Smith, Samson and Buttler to come",2
Stokes has become and opener just out of sheer will . Bats totally unlike an opener yet just powers through by pure grit .,5
Why aren’t they bowling slower balls?,2
mann Chris Gayle is such a fucking leggennddd,2
"Robin ""264"" Uthappa playing nicely",3
Also guys how many times has KL lost the toss? I think atleast 10/13 times right,6
Oh Ben Stokes! How are you so good!??!!,3
KL should give Maxi the next over.,3
Fucking hell Stokes.,1
"Chris Gayle: Outdated 
Maxwell: Overrated
Pooran: Jebaited
Stokes: Activated",-1
Stokes again showing why he is the greatest cricketer of his era.,3
Uthappa approves lmao,2
Stokes is playing for net run rate,4
"Aussies this IPL: Maxi the specialist bowler, Cummins the specialist batsman, Smith the specialist head shaker",16
I forgot that Uthappa was also in the crease. Stokes in full flow....,3
Which team is Rcb fans supporting for favorable outcome? I'm not hopeful of rcb winning either of their 2 remaining games.,2
Maybe RR management were onto something,9
"That shot is the definition of ""creamed""",7
"Scores a 100 last game. 

[Ben Stokes today.](https://i.imgur.com/ETQccel.jpg)",12
A bowler should always aim for wickets.,1
Stokes seeing multiple Samuels on the field atm and he ain't liking it,14
Smudge playing 5D chess by giving us even more top order options,12
“Strike Rate is overrated”,7
RR's team song seems to be composed solely to attract Haryanvi truck drivers.,7
sextillion7thpower. thats it. thats the comment.,6
"As we call it down here, stokes entered ‘poonakam’ mode",3
Wtf did deep just call him Bhen Shtocks??!,2
The game is still on all they need is to get Stokes out and may be 2 tight overs,6
KL needs to stop batting in death and go big if he wants to win the title,5
No one was taking such risks for kings 11 and that's why we have an under par score. Doesn't help that we haven't bowled well as well.,6
Not the first time Hardik Pandya's comments causing a negative impact for Rahul,13
Uthappa has only faced 6 balls lol,10
"By this rate, Stokes will win RR the tournament.",13
Wait you guys hear that sound? It's Samuels crying.,13
Ben Stokes' been stoked about this innings,4
"ok here's a theory.

we seldom see gayle angry. i think he had a very special 100 celebration planned and was pissed he missed out.",32
KXIP fans mouthing ben stokes!,15
Mf's trying to chase this out in 15 overs to up  their chances for play-offs,18
Afridi was a good player but whichever retard called him the greatest t20 player of ALL TIME on cricinfo needs to get into a fight with the undertaker on top of a steel cage,24
This is like Jayasuriya and Kaluwitharana opening,20
Fuck Samuels. He did this. Fucking cunt.,44
"I'm expecting stokes to remove his Jersey and have the words ""sextillion7thpower"" tattooed on his belly",19
Get out Stokes. Aren't World Cup and headingley test enough for you,17
"Ben Stokes hasn’t given Uthappa the opportunity to get himself out.

So cruel!",9
Sasta hardik having a good night with bat ball and field/s,2
KL's 46(41) looks really poor now. Can't go run-a-ball after playing 20+ balls.,13
"Uthappa back at it with the stupid shots, we love to see it",8
Tactical drop.,7
Stokes should try to rotate the strike to Uthappa. Stokes can hit anytime but Uthappa is at his best in the powerplay,1
Tewatiya song in Tamil commentary 🤣🤣🤣,1
sTRiKe RaTE iS oVeRRaTed ™,1
We were told Mayank was out only for one game bruh when is he returning?,2
Uthappa is bringin in bad vibe. Fucking play,3
Here's a conspiracy theory. Oshane Thomas was angry about not getting a game so he phoned Marlon Samuels to write shit about Stokes.,8
Imagine comparing stokes and hardik,6
360d underwater chess by samuels to fire up his mate stokes so that rr can qualify,8
Stokes to hit a century and celebrate by getting 12th man to bring on a shirt with sextillion7thpower on it and then shit on it,11
[deleted],7
Imagine RR winning this year title.,4
How many times has Robin got out playing that shot? Why even bother,4
Man these balls are just falling short of fielders. Need some luck shine on us.,5
Everyone stop jinxing stokes pls,2
A little more effort there and thy was a chance,3
Good over Shami!,6
"Well KXIP been a bit unlucky, two false shots from both openers falling agonizingly short of mid off and mid on.",6
"Meanwhile in this carnage, Uthappa playing like Uthappa.",3
Uthappa all you need to do is get to the non-strikers end,2
Rr will still lose this,3
Remember the name it’s Stokes okay,5
Gayle and Mayank (Provided he is fit) have to open next match for us to have any chance of qualifying.,4
"Rajasthan Royals or, England as they prefer to be known.",6
If kxip doesn't qualify that loss to dc is really going to hurt,5
"Wow Stokes is looking powerful today. But this doesn't look like his usual power. Could it be the......?

"Okay stokes got your point. Now get out, ball isn't Samuel's face",4
Strategic tyres ceatic timeout.,8
This naked guy doing the tongue twister advertisement for Josh app is irritating af.,7
Bro KL now also has a middle order unlike early tournament. What justifies the slow strike rate?,2
It's all fun and jokes until Marlon's perfume really takes off and we have a Sextillion7thpower sixer of the match award in IPL.,21
To think some seasonal cricket watchers were claiming that stokes isn't a good T20 player because of his stats,13
Stokes wielding that #sextillion7thpower,10
"LMAO STOKES, 50 Already?",7
FIFTY ALREADY jesus christ,7
"Uthappa scored 12 50s in a row for KKR during their 2014 title winning year.  
He overshadowed Maxwell in the year when he was Maxwelling the hardest.  
Sad to see this decline",11
"Only if Stokes had returned from NZ earlier and hit this form a few games before, RR would have been in the top 4.",9
So anyways... when is the next IPL?,1
Anyone know what Mayank’s injury is?,1
STOKES CAN FUCK ME SIDEWAYS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY,6
Stokes is GOING OFF,3
He makes it look so unbelievably easy,6
Why does Shami turns to shit on some days? His IPL numbers are embarrassing for a player of his caliber and international success.,0
It's fucking over,1
If Jordan takes a hat trick right now this is still something Tewatia can chase down,1
Another new Josh ad 🤮🤮,3
Wicket this over,1
To think that Stokes has only 1 fifty in IPL before this,2
Ben Stokes carrying this partnership,3
Absolute Mad hitting in do or die match,3
Guys no one can do anything. Stokes is in another mode,3
Sextillion7thpower,3
Uthappa needs to fire. Unfair to put onus on Stokes only,2
That’s a massacre. End it now.,2
"Thank you for coming, Chris Jordan. Stokes has scored 50 out of the 60 RR has.",1
What the hell is this carnage!!! Just tuned back in after kxip innings.. which bowler got cunted today??,2
How about bowling slower deliveries,2
I never doubted you as an opener Stokesy \*furiously deletes comment history\*,8
Stokes OP. Pls nerf,2
"Gini Wijnaldum welcomed with a straight six by Stokes.

Edit - Wijnaldum gets his man immediately.",4
Fuck me what a fifty,4
Its a bit scary going into the T20 WC knowing that most of Indian batsmen are playing the accumulator role. A very few free spirited tonkers,5
Holy shit this guy,2
"This is brilliant

60/0

Stokes 50 of them",2
"I was supporting KXIP all along the match, but I can't complain being a KKR I guess.
Edit: Ummm ok",1
Do rr have a chance?,2
"2018 - Buttler draged rr to playoffs
2020 - stokes??",1
Ben still playing like he's continuing from the previous game,3
So RR going to be the only team to retain all foreigners,5
RR might actually chase this 😐,3
Stokes on green pitches: this is ashes and I’m the king of ashes,2
NO FUCK,2
LOL! What?!! He's got 50 already?!,3
Aaaahhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!!,2
CSK knocks out KKR. And RR knocks out KXIP lulz,2
Wel played Stokes.,3
Robin Uthappa is me in a group project.,14
That was lame Stokes,2
Sanjay Bangar is some cringe,1
"Me while making my dream 11 team : Don't make Ben Stokes vice captain, he ain't gonna score again


Also Ben Stokes : takes 2 wickets and scores 50.",6
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO STOKESSSSSSS FUCKKKK OFFF MAN,3
Punjab's inability to take advantage of the powerplay was going to comeback to bite them in the ass,5
"Bring in tewatia

NOW!!!",2
Ahh well it was fun while it lasted,7
185 doesn’t really seem like a mammoth score sorry,7
"Jordan doing bits

Stokes has played a wonderful knock",8
This 50 is sponsored by Sextillion7thPower.,8
Jordan mah boy,2
😅,3
Phew! But the damage has been done.,5
Here come the KXIP!!!!,2
Ben stokes is the best player in cricket irrespective of formals and he has been the past 2 years.. This is a hill I'm willing to die on.,2
I think it's time for a collapse,1
Fuck. Well it was a good innings,5
Finally he is out,2
Game changing wicket this after a show he put on.,2
"Casual reminder that Stokes has a 66.66% 50 to 100 conversion rate in the IPL

What’s with all the players wearing double caps?,2
Lol same replay catch mother of coincidence,3

Y’ALL WE LOST IT NOW BYE fucking hell. gg KXIP,4
"Goodnight guys, match is over",1
Nooooo,1
Fucker did the damage and left. It's too late,6
"stokes in my fantasy team so I wanted him to get a 50, lose his wicket and kxip win the match. cheers stokesy",5
Finally he times it to mid off,2
Might be too late,2
RR brings out openers among people,4
Maybe the real Marlon was Jordan all along,10
Jordonn !!!!!,2
They are making it look.like shj,3
Thank god,2
Is twitter down?,1
"Nehraji: Ben Stokes. Der aaye, durust aaye

Just don't want Samson's cameo now. Get him cheaply,5

EDIT: missed samson from the list :(",2

That was a meh end to a terrific performance,5

"Smith, Samson, Jos, Tewatia, Archer still to come lol. GG",6
FUCK! YES!,2
Bring tewatia you cowards,3
It's ok. RR will still win. Stokes set the platform,5
He did his job. Now for the others to take it forward,2
"Smith to get set while Robin attacks, or Robin to anchor while Samson attacks.",2
Jos to come in at 8,6
Sanju 6(2) pls,3
Oh no if only there was one of the best T20 batsmen in the world waiting... oh hang on Jos is here,6
Now smudge please come and do what you are great at- test knock needed,3
Stokes had to stay there till 10 overs,1
Oh no Ben stokes,1
Collapse has started,0
Would have been great to see him go on and get a ton but that’s the role of stokes in the team. I would much rather have this that 1 ball 1 run stokes from earlier his season,2
"Everytime someone gets out after a 6, we should call it a samson TM",3
Great innings to give us the best start,3
Well well well how the turntables,1
"Stokes often loses focus after 50.

Done his job though",1
Jordan has Sextillion7thPower confirmed,3
"Samson, Smith, Buttler and Tewatia to come with a RRR < 9. This should be quite doable.",2
"Meet you next year,rr. Gg stokes and archer",2
It would be criminal for the rest of RR to not win from here after that blitz from Kiwi-Ben,1
Jordan to get a lifetime supply of sextillion7thpower,7
So a wicket less powerplay was a dream after all.,3
Blue eyed prince pls show some magic today..,2
100 and 50 in a row. Quite funny when people were criticising him for never scoring a half century for RR before.,3
A couple of wickets and 3-4 tight overs would be very welcome.,5

Noooooooooooooo NO Ben Stokes,1
Ben 'clutch' Stokes.,2
Now they will slow down.,4
"Okay, should we consider 2nd wicket has already fallen considering Samson came to bat",3
If kxip wins rcbs chances get dimmer. Even if they're quite bright,2
Still calling this as KXIP win,5
"RR fans reverse jinxers, saying they have lost the game after Stokes' wicket

Since when did you start **depending** on his batting? You have Jos fucking Buttler yet to come",23
I'm trying myself to not get my hopes up :/,7
"Game over, the adventure was fun but now is time for 5th place once more",1
"Thank you, Jordan!!!!",1
That seemed like a lazy stroke,1
I know I’m going to get downvoted for this but Jesus Christ why does harsha always sound so gay? Genuinely the Ned Flanders of cricket,-2
Lmao robbie didn’t even get a sniff all powerplay,9
Now it’s time for certain rr players to do their best to help them lose the game before another Englishman attempts to bail them out,4
I've now tried both Hotstar on TV and Star Sports on DTH. Sorry to say but Hotstar doesn't even come remotely close to the actual channel in terms of video quality and bit rate.,10
Ah Stokesy wanted to see you play a little more,5
A lifetime supply of sextillion7thpower being shipped to Jordan as we speak,18

Sad for RR but happy for Punjab,3
Jeez stop with the cologne comments already. You'll are giving that scum what he wants,8
This team is just England players doing their best to win while having about 5 others seemingly attempting to lose,5
Samson's batting is so stylish,8
I feel that this is going to be Robbie's night,3
A quick 30 here from Sanju will put enormous pressure on Punjab,4
Samdaddy mode on,5

"Rahul 46(41), bruh wtf. The way Gayle and Pooran batted, they should have gone over 200. If they lose this game, this is entirely on Rahul, should have scored more in such a high scoring game. How deluded people have to be, to call him the best T20 batsman, the guy inflates his stats so much.",7
Well played rr..... See you all next season,3
Dude my girlfriend needed that much long,5
Sexy...,2
The game's KXIP 35:65 RR as per cricket.com right now.,3
Sanju Samson what a shot!!,6
Pant could never,4
That T-shirt tuck just at the front. Makes it look like Swann has a MASSIVE beer belly.,9
Incoming wicket?,3
Swann wearing RR T-shirt just made my day.,5
"If Samson goes , up comes jos 

Man this is P A I N",11
Ohh boy...here we go again,3
"Honestly, would rather take Samson over Iyer and Pandey in a T20 team.",6
Samdaddy,3
hoooly crap samson absolutely smoked it,5
Sixer Sanju on his way back to the top of the six hitters table,3
woah I didn’t know they had a Sanju.mp3 chant,9
Aight sanju show us what u made of,5
Congrats punjab u hve got samson out now,4
Say what you want about Sanju  . There is no one else who can be called the Indian Nicholas pooran .,14
"Bc dugout sanju ka chhakka dikhao, swanny ki flamingo taange nhi",6
Samson looks a different played after his selection.,3
Why would you not continue with spin smh,2
"Samson realized after his first boundary that hes never going to be selected for India unless he plays a responsible™ inning of 30(31).

Edit: Perfect timing for my post :/",9
What is Samson like in FC cricket? Looks like he has good technique,3
Sanju's quota is over now lol,6
KXIP will lose this when they get the wicket of Robin,10
Smriti Mandhana's team jersey looks like one of Zimbabwe's jerseys,10
Swann should record and sent the broadcasters the Tewatia chant when the Lord comes to bat,6
“Always nice to see women in action..”,29
Commentators trying so hard to sound enthusiastic about women's cricket,13
It infuriates me that BCCI still haven't grown the balls to host a full fledged women's IPL despite the WBBL being such a hit in a country that is is far less cricket crazy than us.,13
Samson playing sensibly? What world are we living in?,8
98 of 68.. come on boys 👦,4
Quick Stat: Uthappa goes past his worst season in IPL by runs scored (174 in 15 games in 2009). Next targets are 264 (2011) and 282 (2019). In all others he has scored 300+,10
Why dont they play any chants when the bowler is going good? Batriachy must die,18
Should have continued with bishnoi and murgan,8
Maybe KL costed KXIP 20-25 runs today.... Hate to say this,12
"Not gonna lie, Australians fast bowlers on Australian pitches would be all over Samson.

And perhaps unpopular opinion: all over SKY too!",24
Well Sanju SR this season convinced selectors to consider him over Pant who has not exceeded SR of 130-140 this season,8
"Swann is so full of joy, jest and energy. Definitely my new favourite commentator.",21
Is it bad to fix matches and make a lot of money?,7
"It’s always nice to see Women in action......


In this format of the game. 
Lmao what a way to say it this madman",10
[deleted],42
whooa we're half way there!,11
Looks like my 10 coins bet on RR may pay off,8
Sanju Sensible Samson,17
Pure class,3
This is RR's game to lose.,9
"Bruh idk how but Samson has somehow gotten more smarter, like he is not giving away his wicket and playing smartly.",25
That wasn’t fortuitous wtf. It was well played,13
"Rajasthan team is seriously over powering, multiple match winners in lineup till 5-6 down...  sad that butler and smyth did not hit their form",17
I love the Govinda cred ad.,4
Where is the spin?,4
"From what I saw from Stokes and Tewatia, pace off might be the better option",7
Punjab bowling back to being shit. Playoff Qualification scene in danger ⚠️,13
RR running away with the game.,6
punjab do something pls,4
Royals game to lose from here on .,-2
I don't think Arshdeep has been as good a bowler as the commentators make him out to be,4
TAP IT GOD DAMNIT,1
RR making a mockery of KXIP’s bowling,8
Only chance now is for rr to pull an srh,6
Sad to see women T20 kit not having sponsors,9
Easy win for Royals from here.,3
Lol the umpire trolled the Swann by not tapping the watch,19
I guess Smith told Samson to TrAiN SmArTeR,13
[Samson after hitting 6 and not getting out](https://ibb.co/XW2ftJH),10
I swear all indian batsmen naturally have great hands.  What they don’t have us the ability to not destroy the buffet,9
"If only hadn't he been a wicketkeeper, he would be more than IPL sanju",5
"People now shitting on Rahul saying they should have went for 200 and he should've gotten out sooner.

My dear Bros, Another wicket and you have a tailender Maxi to content with for his 12(14) with a boundary of a pie that he egdes to behind fine leg. We wouldn't get close to anywhere.",19
Wicket this over,6
Why is Singham acting in a historical Tanhaji Movie?,2
RR peaking a little too late..,3
"I see a lot of other fans are surprised but real Punjab fans are used to this. Flatter to deceive throughout and somehow come close and people feel we deserve to be in the playoffs but we still miss out. 

What's new?",16
"nice to see Maxwell, specialist spinner is being hidden in this game.",4
Samsung wants to be the Galaxy Boss.,9
Uthappa acting sus,5
"With no Uthappa there’s no Dwayne Leverock legendary catch, and cause of that I’ll always be thankful for him",8
My mum changed channel to star plus 😠😠😠😠,21
"Had CSK won one more match against MI/DC/RCB , it would have been one hell of an IPL",3
Liking the contest between josh and insta reel ad For who can make shittiest ad,6
There is nothing that I hate more than strategic timeout. It like breaks my mojo of watching.,8
These visaka ads are so retarded.. who tf signs off on this shit,3
RR would prob be in the top 4 if Stokes was available from the start,3
"Wtf is that cringe ad

Oh its instagram reels . makes sense",7
"Huh why does this me of the first half of the kxip campaign this year

Coming off with huge momentum, only to be stumped by RR and then lose from there onwards.",3
Smith to samson: getting out after six is gay,9
Is Arshdeep chewing gum while bowling?,3
"""Arshdeep Singh to Samson, FOUR, talk about brainy batting! Almost the perfect wide yorker from Arshdeep, except that it's gone for four. Samson sat deep in the crease and opened the face to get this right between Rahul and short third man. Deliberately done and he gets full value for it.""


Commentators were saying it was fortuitous..",9
Aight this IPL is having so funny way of biting up the ass,5
why is Samson playing at overrated strike rate?,8
[deleted],5
Is that rakul preet Singh in that Eva ad?,7
Kl be like lund pe rakhte hai orange cap ko,22
Bowling has been underwhelming so far,9
"Over after strategic timeout.

Dugout: wicket alert

Me: such expert, much wow!",11
Lmao Uthappa playing that same sweep shot over and over,10
"fuck the ceat tyres strategic time out, all my homies hate the ceat tyres strategic time out",10
"Wicket next over then Collapse, trying to match up Stokes strike rate",2
Is Uthappa the aNcHoR?,6
"Even Sanju Samson has crossed uthappa's runs, singles is all he can score.. Atleast he rotates the strike.",2
Bowl out Cottrell before Tewatia comes on!,8
ਆਹ ਵਧੀਆ ਆ,1
BIG DICK ENERGYYYYYY,8
"Jokes on u kxip, we even bought samson in form",5
Sanju How fucking amazing Samson,7
It is hard to imagine RR bottling this now tbh,3
Deposited,2
Tuned in and Samson hits a 6. I'm gonna tune out and time it again.,8
RR gonna finish this game in 15 overs?,8
looks like the winning streak is going to come to a halt tonight.,3
Samson's sixes just look so effortless,13
They have summoned lord sanju there is no way they are winning this,6
I LOVE SANJU SAMSON,13
How are RR able to score 100 in 10 overs regularly without taking any risks. Back to back matches now.,2
Pant making sad noises watching Samson bat,6
RR are in a good position but could really use a sort of Clive Rose-type figure to Chad their way to victory.,3
Mandatory samsON comment,6
"Sanju Samson lofted shots ,love it",7
What are the chances of RR qualifying?,8
"Samson is in full flow here... Looking at this thread, everyone wanted six and out Samson, but he's 21*(12).",7
RR will want to win this asap to boost up their shit NRR and shit on KXIP's NRR.,10
"In an unfortunate turn of events, Rajasthan seems to be winning tonight, how can Punjab qualify now?",12
Uthappa is rotating the strike really well,10
"Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet",6
"Fuck you Samson you fucking brain dead cunt. You turn up 50% of the time vs Punjab and do fuck all most of the time. What the fuck did we do to you, you fucking moron. Now you'll play for India and score 10(7) as usual. Fucking hate this game",22
"Dude's hittin the ball so good, No hate on kohli but he can't clear the rope with that ease",14
But we were supposed to be the comeback team 🥺🥺🥺,22
Uthappa is going to finish not out on 40,16
RR showing how to chase down a score.,19
Uthappa did well this tournament. RR will stick with him.,16
As a kkr fan i am happy seeing kxip in this position,6
"Samson is playing a blunder right now

Edit: Blinder* lol",11
sad letzooo noises,5
"SRH must be the most happy right now. They net run rate is too good, they have to beat a RCB side on a losing streak and Mumbai side that is looking ahead to the playoffs.",5
CSK should lose to Punjab to make the points table interesting,6
"Memes aside, Samson has been fairly decent this IPL with more than 2 customary good performances(his usual)  
  
I have a feeling that given Koach's emphasis on fitness, Samson is slowly sliding past Rishab Pant's double chin into the preference charts",27
Samson celebrating his India call,10
"Scenes if RR retain uthappa, unadkat",9
Specialist strike rotator,8
"I just want us to win this without any drama, is that asking too much?",11
Bringing Stokes and Samson in form was 5D chess move by MI so they don't have to face Gayle in playoffs,8
Looking tough for rr,3
Uthappa is specialist non striker,17
Is this a knockout game?,6
[deleted],3
Who's your pick for emerging player of the year,3
Sanju plays 3-4 good innings per season. Two of them are against us :(,9
DJ jammin 'gal ban gayi' damn noice,3
Add Samson to the I hate Tewatia club,7
Samson is a pure timer. All timing no muscle. He is anti-Stoinis,6
KL's 46 from 41 is  atrocious. Stokes managed to score more in 15 less balls,4
I'm happy for Rajasthan but sad because those arrogant f#ckers in DC will make the playoffs now.,1
Lmao Uthappa tryna hurt KKR from another team,7
"RR against CSK (1st match), MI (last match chase) and today have seemed like an unstoppable force. Its unfortunate they were rank bad in other games. Had they been consistent, they'd be top of the table.",7
Come Jordan our saviour!!,2
"Samson seems to have learned from his previous mistakes , seems to be patient in picking his balls.",6
Strike rate is overrated,5
"Both are playing spinners well, shouldn't they give a over to Jordan or Shami",1
Can we still qualify after losing today?,3
samson's PR team is unparalleled,1
 **Kings XI**  will not give up,1
Buttler should come next.,2
This dude really hit around 40% of his sixes against us alone 😭😭😭😭😭 what a joke,9
"I hope RR win today, DC and SRH win tomorrow so that we can see an absolutely ridiculous points table with 4 teams on 12 points, and a difference of only 6 points between the top and the bottom team.",6
Agent Uthappa survives.,4
This is crazy good from RR,4
Damn son!!,8
"Robin Uthappa, that you? 😳",3
Uthappa striking this cleanly is not something I expected,2
Is it enough for RR to win or do they need to win big?  They're on -0.5 NRR. So a marginal win here might not do much other than screw KXIPs happiness.,1
"Finnaly,  the team because of whom we couldnt qualify.... Is suffering and i am happy......",1
TBH when Samson is in his flow he is one of the classiest player to watch,4
Take that r/cricket,3
"with Smith, Buttler, Tewatia, and Archer to bat this should, keyword should, be easily doable. but ya never know with RR",4
[deleted],6
What a shot Robbie,6
Uthappa is like enough with the reverse shit,6
"Samson seemingly learning from his mistakes and not throwing his wicket away while also striking the ball well

  


Pant: Surprised Pikachu",4
"It's only a slog sweep if it's played in the Slog region of France, otherwise it's only a sparkling sweep.",5
75 off 56 required with 9 wickets in hand,2
"Robin ""KKR"" Uthappa is back",9
We are in huge huge huge huge trouble.,4
Uthappa turning the clock. Used to love his shots!,5
I used to love watch Uthappa bat in the old times... He looks so good when he's in his elements!,13
Nelson strikes,5
Universe Boss already in 3rd place with 23 sixes in just 6 matches.,15
"To answer all questions, KXIP wont be technically out after today's loss.",11
RR's game to lose,4
There he is.,9
Uthappa did his job tho,9
6 and out Samson transferred his curse to Uthappa,15
Looks late though,4
"You know what, that's good enough Robbie, well played.",13
Out👍🏻😎😀,2
MuruGUN,3
Uthappa did his job.,6
Six out six out six out LOL,6
CAN KXIP PL TURN THIS GAME AROUND AND WIN,6
Only smithy can win it for kxip here come on boy please dont send butler in now,9
Yay now Butler is in and will finish it in 5 overs🔥🔥🔥🔥,6
"The ""six and out"" disease is contagious",16
Well played Robin,1
Should I be happy or sad?,2
Watch rr bottle this chase.,6
Well this is interesting,1
"mf almost gets out and hits the flattest six ever, nice",3
When even Robin has a higher strike rate than kl,7
That was unneeded from Uthappa! He should have stayed there for a couple more overs,5
Butler Smith should be dependable enough to pull this off,5
Another wicket for Nelson! His strike rate is ridiculous given he's been dead for ages.,6
Not too upset with the wicket. Smith in and Samson to go aggressive now with Buttler to come,7
"**10.5** Ashwin to Uthappa, OUT,  **111-2**

RV Uthappa c Pooran b Ashwin 30 (23b 1x4 2x6) SR: 130.43",2
RR please don't choke from here. There is only one choker this season and that's us.,7
[deleted],5
It's ok Robbie. You scored 30 more than I expected,10
The 111 curse..,2
Don’t bottle this shit I beg you. I’ll have to trust other teams now cause my team is garbage.,1
Collapse.exe,1
This match has become like r/WallStreetBets,7
"Uthappa is doing good since he came back to his preferred slot of opening position.

Not sure why stupid team managements/coaches try to tinker a lot in the name of experimentation. This is always synonymous with struggling teams.

Bad management is directly correlated with teams doing bad.",7
[deleted],4
Can Smith play sensibly here and take RR to victory? This kind of RRR is his forte.,1
Why do RR send Butler in so late when he’s one of the best t20 batsmen in the world?,6
"My mom thought Steve Smith’s surname is Simpson, so she was like “now Simpson will come”",10
Smith to play his anchor innings 15(35),5
Well done Robbie. A 30 is as good as a 50 in T20,8
"Gayle at 41 smashing Bowlers makes you think Dhoni is not old he's just bad if not for getting lucky having to face Bowlers Nuwan Kulasekera, Corey Anderson, James Faulkner etc most of his career😞",4
Will smith be smart today or casual?,3
Should’ve just sent Butler out there. Try and get it done early. You still have power hitting lower down.,7
"Buttler is wasted at 5, he’s too good to be just a finisher.",8
Is there any reason to play smith here instead of buttler ?he hasn't had a good knock this season,9
I wouldn't bother unpacking Smithy,4
"75 for 55 with 8 wickets in hand, Buttler and Smith still left. This should be easy for RR.",16
Typical Uthappa dismissal,7
On the bright side Uthappa scored 30 more runs than expected,7
Run rate shouldn't be a problem for RR because there's Buttler and the Lord still left,4
I wanna see Lord smite the unbelievers today,7
With 3 overs from Jordan it can go Punjab way,9
Uthappa played better than KL today,11
I hope we get batting freak Steve Smith today.,8
Smith please play like that Manish Pandey innings,11
I was told this was a competitive score? Has KXIP been poor or is RR batting too well?,6
Tevatia should come and play a cameo,1
Did nelson strike yet again.,2
Hoping for a thala innings from Smith. Only way Punjab can win now,7
"Send Buttler ffs, really don't like how Jos has been treated this IPL",10
THEY STILL HAVE BUTTLER TO COME,4
"r/cricket: this is gonna be easy for RR

KXIP: that's what we thrive on bitches! Deep Shit!",12
Jordan and Shami gotta do some magic here,7
"Uthappa out.


KXIP fans: *sigh of relief*


RR fans: *sigh of relief*",19
Smudge experimenting again... tryna be funky,8
"Why is Jos batting 5 its like RCB when they put de villiers there. 

Imagine jos having 55 balls to bat, if he bats through this isnt even close instead he might walk out when he needs 40 off 20 which is when he isn't at the same level he needs a few balls to start",6
"I think Smith wastes an overseas spot, if they get an Indian captain, RR can play a specialist pacer like Tye or Thomas to compliment Archer",5

Hope to see lord tewatia bat today,3

"uh oh modern day bradman with an early boundary, this might be over",3

RR batting looking murderous all of a sudden.,2
Smudge finally gonna come through today?,4
Damn how many KXIP theme shirts does Zinta have?,7
Smith slapping r/cricket?,5
"I want Smudge to score but he'll play slow and put pressure on Sanju, so I wouldn't mind if he goes all guns blazing or gets out so Jos can come bat.",5
Googly is bowled by a wrist spinner and it comes out of his behind - Sanjay Bangar,13
Sanjay wtf was that explanation about. You could've said it turns the other way. It's a 10 year old.,5
Samson playing sensibly? How?,4
I guess we are in for Tewatia finish,3
"1. Mi 
2. Rcb
3. Kxip
4. RR 

My prediction for playoffs",7
This chase ain't stopping. Looks like one of RR's rare days,3
RR is really gonna nail two 180+ chases back to back,6
"Might be getting ahead of myself, but If RR pull this off, then the equation for SRH couldn't be easier. Just have to win the next two games. Easier said than done obviously but with MI being the last match of the tournament, they might have already secured top 2 by the time we play them. A win against RCB and we'll probably be the favorites to make the playoffs of the current contenders.",6
Bishnoi has been bowling extremely outside offside whole game and getting hit all over the ground. Maybe it's time to change strategy.,2
"They literally don't give a flying fuck about wickets. Just good aggressive Batting. You fucking moron kl, take note",19
KL played too slow and was the main difference tonight. Even Uthappa scored faster than him.,12
On their day rr batting lineup is just a bully.,19
Jaiswal needs to open next year alongside Stokes. Hopefully the domestic season before the IPL will benefit him.,3
This is a 200+ pitch. KL played poorly and RR bowled brilliantly,20
Maxi no spinny?,7
RR were almost at a similar situation last year Vs KXIP and R. Ashwin mankadded him. There's one Ashwin on the field. Just saying..,16
Smith 50(51) final ptsd jumps in as soon as he plays 2 dots,6
Punjab 5 match streak on its way to be broken unless theres brain fade form rr . Does anyone know what's the biggest win stereak in ipl,8
"Even if RR wins this and the next match they won't qualify bcoz shit NRR
As when they actually win it'll do fuckall to their NRR!!",6
"If Smith gets into form, along side Samson, Stokes and Butler ..RR will be iRResistible",8
Choke.exe not responding,7
"TBH, it is really difficult to bowl to Steve Smith. Dude manufactures something out of somewhere. Not necessarily boundary shots but is so busy and finds those angles even from awkward positions.",6
Stokes should get MotM assuming they win this.,3
If Maxi wasn't so shit KL wouldn't have to be playing his  100 S/R aNcHoR innings,7
Is that Zebra Jadhav in disguise,1
ashes innings incoming from steve smith,4
Please RR don't do an SRH today,3
"So every 120sr innings is a doing a koach now, lol",0
"A fan frustrated by KL's innings said ""orange cap ko gaand me daal le bc"" and he is almost doing that literally rn",7
The chase for playoffs is so fun to watch.,3
"Even if RR wins this and the next match they won't qualify bcoz shit NRR
As when they actually win it'll do fuckall to their NRR!!",1
"If there was a combined Karnataka and former RCB team made out of KXIP team

KL RAHUL, M AGARWAL, CHRIS GAYLE, KARUN NAIR,  MANDEEP SINGH, SARFARAZ KHAN, C JORDAN, K GOWTHAM, M ASHWIN, J SUCITH AND ANIL KUMBLE
Looks like a decent team to me, maybe a seam bowler short.

Since KXIP is always looking for a second home base, they should try out the hubli or mysore stadiums. They would surely get huge support",7
"Bruh, they are playing the Udta Punjab title track. Don't they know what the movie's about?",10
How 2 wickets can rip up this game open,3
Bangar you gotta explain the how the turn is different as well.,2
"KL started practicing for the Australia test series in this game itself.  
Should have scored quicker",3

"As cringy as bangar is, he is very knowledgeable on the game and that’s why he is in dugout",17
Smith tries too much in the IPL. Hope he continues the same brainfade during the next summer down under.,4
So Maxi was a specialist fielder today. And he dropped a catch today,9
Rahul wants 2 wickets to fall to see tewatia bat?,6
Please tell me Brian named his daughter Lara.,11

"This is how I felt when england chased 230 in the wct20-2016 against South africa. Cut off one head, another is there to just tonk you.",13
Run a ball and 6 boundaries ties the game harsha . MBA maths .,6
"Dang, I really thought there was something in the pitch but it looks more and more like Rahul single-handedly fucked KXIP with 46(41)",4
"Bangar is very knowledgeable technically,  but struggles with the language to the point he doesn't make much sense.",17
"Only MI & RR have the batting firepower to go 200+ more often than not, without any 1 batsman doing bulk of the scoring. Other teams need 1 of the top to go far. If not, their other batsmen tend to slow down so as not to reach 200.",7
"Sledge Smudge, KL, you coward",6
Lmao they did nagarkoti dirty.,7

"I said sanjay bangar sometimes acts like the annoying uncle , Lara just got a dose of it .",8
"I would include Samson in my team just to see him hit a 6, idc if he gets out after that",14
Sanju is taking unnecessary risks,4
Sanju is replicating SKY here,9
how tf can Samson play like this beast in ipl but always shit in domestic,7
KL really has to up his strike rate if KXIP want to win these matches.,14
Poor bowling.,1
What are the odds of Sanju playing two good knocks in a season against the same opposition,5
Sensible Samson is pretty dangerous looking,8
Samson performing in two games in a row in the second half of the tournament,8
Now the game is well and truly over.,3
samson hits the sauciest sixes,7
"Murgan ashwin is like ""fuck it gand marao behenchod nahi khelna hai""",8
Time to drop Maxi if he doesn’t even bowl. KXIP can’t win anymore with Jadhav Lite in the team,5
Samson somehow follows up his six with a four these days rather than a wicket!,5
It was a good winning run KXIP.. still not out of playoffs and I still believe they will make it to 4th position.,1
Samson this season has been like a cosine wave,2
Samson is exceeding our expectations playing like this.,3
Which batting line up is the strongest on its day?,0
Imma say it again RCB flair for match bot is match fixing,14
for gods sake please give one over to Jordan/Shami and bowl a spicy bouncer to Samson,1
It's RR's game to lose from here.,0
sextillion7thpower supplies heading towards samsons home,2
We tried Punjab. We tried.,4
"Hope Samson continues to be sensible

He's too good to be wasted",6
"To paraphrase the great Waqar Younis: ""Samson hits the ball hard, the ball stays hard""",6
"I think that Samson's domestic figures are slightly affected by the fact that he's in a weak Ranji team.  
Maybe he runs out of partners or the team comes under pressure way quicker than the stronger ones",7
Damn Samson wants that unacademy cracking sixer of the tournament award,2
Sky playing to prove he should have been selected. Sanju playing to prove she should be in the 11 and not on the bench.,3

Sanju Samson's head is so still when he unleashes his shots. When on song he is such a clean hitter..,7
Now all my hopes are on Jordan.,2
Samson must now be the best six hitter in India.,6
Wtf was that poll lol,7
We're on the backfoot and seems like we're going down. So what's the scenario for Kings XI to qualify now?,3
"What do you call 30 Korean smartphones in Japanese?  

  
San Jyu Samsung",8
"I hate Abu Dhabi

I hate our absolute rotten luck in tosses

I hate that rat tewatia

I fucking hate Samson who only turns up against us

I hate cricket",11
"Just go for it guys, I wanna see jos and the lord bat",2
Sick Yorker by CJ there,4
But but _sR iS oVeRrAtEd_,8
"Samson scores a lot of runs ,plays very good shots but Uthappa is More Elegant any day of the week",3
Rajasthan started Punjab's Losing streak at the start of the tournament and Rajasthan are going to end Punjab's winning streak at the end of the tournament. Bc,7
Who is the most elegant batsman ever,2
"Uthappa is more elegant than Samson. I bet indian people voted for Samson given his recent form.
Uthappa in his prime was beautiful to watch",15
Someone called RR a meme team in the thread earlier. What do you think now mate?,9
Bring Glenn Maxitharan,11
Well Fuckety. Lord Tewatia hasn't even arrived yet.,2
Runs coming way too easy now,2
how does one exactly measure elegance in cricket? I honestly can't tell how elegant Sanju is,12
KXIP out after today?,1
we all remember tewatia during the last rr vs kxip match but samson was on a rampage too,7
"Chris Jordan has one good ball. If it’s not in the block hole, it’s dog dirt.",5
Shami sucks at running.,5
"Had Rahul scored another couple of boundaries, it would have been so much better",2
Shami bhai gotta do better than that,9
Smith is a great batsman but his technique looks like he used to be a particularly violent woodcutter before he started cricket,6
With that quickfire innings Stokes has proven he is batter boy not batty boy. Suck it Uncle Marlon!,6
Did someone tell Samson a new season has started ?,26
This is not the samson I wished today,1
felt that was bye,1
18 over finish here. Rajasthan batting really well.,4
"He knows how to relieve the pressure , sanju",6
Yeah. This game is gone. Hopefully we win next one and make it to the playoff. Would be gutted to come so far yet miss out on playoffs.,5
What a shot,3
Samson is so fun to watch,9
Those were legbyes no?,2
"RR has loads of England Players

RR looks amazing on paper but never lives up to expectations

RR = England

England looked like they were going out of the world cup

England had to beat the 3 good teams in a row to get to the final

England won the world cup

Therefore RR will definetly win the IPL this year",14
In how many overs do RR need to win this for them to overtake KXIP?,6
"Yeah kxip, hope you now know how it feels when all teams be rooting against you",13
Jordan you bowled a shit ball. What are you laughing about? Go back to the bowling mark,3
~~Strike rate~~ Life is overrated,12
Samson in full mood today. God he loves KXIP,10
Gayle gonna fuck his teammates today lol,8
"Sanju has been so good, rocks an SR of 170+ and is a great keeper",12
I play that exact shot in the basketball court tennis ball cricket - the jump cut,13
that's one of the greatest shot for two I have seen in a long time.,6
"Stokes basically took the RRR part out of the picture, wickets was the only way and KXIP couldn't get those today sadly",11
Whose win is good for RCB?,3
RR winning this game is better for the tournament right ?,6
Harsha should be banned from saying the word good. Makes it so unnecessarily weird.,6
Sanju ELEGANT Samson,5
Shami is very casual today,1
"Who are best six-hitters among Indians?

I'd say Rohit, Jadeja..",5
I still chuckle at the fact that rahul saif strike rates are overrated,3
How were both the Punjab v RR matches in Sharjah?,-1
So Samson is justifying his selection,4
"KXIP is the new RCB, failed to score 1 runs in 3 deliveries but went on the defend 5 runs in super over. Couldn't defend 223 but went on to defend 126. Now getting destroyed while defending 185.",4
Buttler did literally nothing in this game. Press F for my guy.,6
Which team will buy Unadkat next season?,2
RR went from being over dependent on Buttler to not needing him at all WTF,16
"i hope cred becomes the sponsor of the indian team... love the ads, n fucking tired of byjus' boring ads",7
Yeah this was not very cash money of you scriptwriter today,4
Looks like the qualifiers are gonna go till the last match.,5
Lara is an underrated analyst. Obviously one of the greatest players ever would know how to read the game. Dugout is perfect for him.,12
What a shot by Samson.,3
RRR is around 7. Maybe they should try to improve their NRR,4
"If RR win here, does Steve Smith take the hard decision to possibly drop himself and let Jos captain? The reason being RR's Indian  fast bowlers barring Tyagi a bit are just not up to it. Can Tom Curran come in his place and be a better option then them?",7
Running on a miss field crazy times,1
Stoner Shami wasn't expecting the ball,6
"What a satisfying run chase, everyone is contributing.",7
How good do you have to be to play Buttler as a specialist fielder,17
Jordan back to being shit again,1
Shami isn’t a natural athlete is he..,2
This game's done... Makes next 3-4 days interesting,3
Samson and Stokes really killed us didn't they,7
They're cruising here,1
"This chase has been very very smooth, no drama or nerves",1
[removed],-1
Dew is killing KXIP,-1
Fucked it up.. damn you Punjab.. all efforts of csk going down the drain,1
That shot is Steve Smith written all over it,2
Rr will still lose,-1
Wish we could have seen Lara playing T20.,0
This is peak KLPD. KXIP never fails to mess with their fans' emotions.,3
Rahul should be stripped as captaincy. Guy has absolutely no clue how to bat first. Fucking ball waster. Useless cunt,-9
Are Hotstar ads personalised?,5
"This match is over. Save your half an hour.

My god Delhi you are so shit but still in the hunt! Unfucking believable!",5

"Pads and edges, CJ's gonna come back",0
Instagram Reels cringe only rivaled by Josh™®,2
Even Smith is getting back to form tells you how bad Maxwell is in IPL 😞,2
smudge finally doing smudge tings,1
"I wanted Punjab to lose today but I also want them to qualify! Play for the NRR, take it deep!!",1
Samson turning into his biblical namesake. **Are you not entertained?**,2
Someone tell KL that SR Is OvErRaTeD and watch Stokes and Samson rocking both elegance and SR,4
Out,2
I still have hope,0
FUCK,2
"IPL continues to surprise, looks like the Punjab bandwagon has finally been halted by Rajasthan today.

With Stokes in from, Rajasthan are looking quite hard to beat.",4
"I think that RR are built to chase totals.   
Its when they have to defend a total with Jofra+any 2/3 guys walking on the streets in the Gulf that they falter",5
"he's so in

Edit: sike WTF, what a dumb way to lose your wicket",2
[deleted],2
Ok I am sure I am missing some context but 46 off 41 is terrible in a T20. This looks like a 200+ pitch.,2
Can RR only chase down high totals or something?,6
That's exactly what they needed... Brilliant,2
Was that Sachin's voice,5
Sachin Tendulkar third umpire,7
Abey bc,1
Ofc it's jagdeeshan,2
Strike rate is overrated,2
We seriously choked against this bowling attack chasing 126? Never change SRH middle order lmao,4
Why would you do that.,2
If kxip loses then rcb and dc can’t be beat by points alone ?,1
Fuck,3
"Smudge, you whopper.",8
Fuck it we peasants (literally) are never going to win the IPL.,3
Finally got to hear my man Paschim Pathak 😍😍,8
Idiott,1
Shieeeeeet,1
"Who should win for KKR to have a chance at qualification ? (Other than KKR themselves, obviously)",2
Captain my captain,5
Scriptwriter dinally onto something,4
"Even if it's out way too late. Jos is here, Smith is here",5
Man this umpire is so soft spoken.,13
[removed],-15
Imagine if our batting had been in this form all tournament...,3
Sachin sounding umpire is the Rockstar umpire lmao,14
KL's lust for the orange cap cost them at least 20 runs.,0
Lmao is Tendulkar the 3rd umpire?,7
KXIP need to control the runflow. Play for NRR guys.,2
Oh don't fuck this up,3
Sachin is the 3rd umpire?,3
Twist in the tail?,1
Is it Sachin in 3rd umpire?,10
Nacho bc,2
Tendulkar back on Third Umpiring,9
Gotta add Samson with Pollard to the list of fuckers who always perform against KXIP,1
My dad thought Sachin Tendulkar is the third umpire lmaoo,15
Rajasthan about to collapse in the sextillion7thhour,10
Samsoff,1
Tendulkar is 3rd umpire?,4
"Of all batters who batted for a minimum of 10 balls today, Rahul's SR is by far the lowest (112), second lowest is Uthappa (130)",3
"Fuck, is sachin the third umpire? /s",3
Smith you absolute piss taker,4
Tendulkar is the 3rd umpire,2
Samsung is OUT!,4
Lol is Sachin the third umpire?,6
Ah yessssss!!! Fuck of samson,-1
Oh god thats out,2
"Aila, sachin as third umpire",9
"Too late now the game’s gone, Buttler/Lord gonna come in and do the job",3
Pirate umpire voice needs a makeover what a shame it is,6
"Wow the 3rd umpire's voice is kinda weird

Oh it's the long haired guy",8
"The 3rd Umpire Sounds like Sachin Tendulkar, Marathi connection?",10
Sachin 3rd umpire,11
Who this aila sachin sounding third umpire?,6
Buttler please. fuck.,4
Butler will finish us off tho,3
Is Tendulkar as third umpire ?,6
Steve and running out his team mates,8
Third umpire sounds like he's doing a Sachin impression,5
Samson unlucky.. deserved a 50,12
Its fucking Suchith again,9
Send Lord Tewatia now to repeat his miracle,5
In the second half of the tournament luck is on KXIP side,3
"Suchith OP fielder

Brilliant run out",7
Is it Sachin in the 3rd umpire box?,3
Yo hold up is Tendulkar the 3rd umpire?,3
Paschim Pathak has the hair of a pirate and the voice of a.....gazelle,6
Well played steve smith,2
Hell yeah,0
Lol the third umpire is both the long haired one and the one with Sachin's voice. Never knew it was the same guy.,6
Fucking fuck off fucktard! He deserved his half century and to close the fucking game!!,8
"A look at this and the last innings, Samson has shown controlled aggression and seamlessly played at great strike rate. Perfect use if his skills.",6
Smith you fool!!,8
Plot twist,3
Surely they won't collapse from here right? RIGHT??,7
Send the Lord you cowards..,6
Butler!!!!,3
When did Sachin Tendulkar become a third umpire lol,9
"Man should have atleast gotten his 50, still nice to see him being a little consistent",3
He was looking so good :(,4
No Choke pls,2
Specialist Fielder™ strikes again,6
If indian cricketers are rich why Sachin had to become Third Umpire 😞,13
RR should look to improve their NRR too not just win the game.,1
Dafuq? I thought this was Tendulkar,4
No :(,1
Both my captain and vice captain for fantasy Rahul and Samson are gone just before 50. Tryna fuck me up,3
Doesn't the 3rd umpire sound a lot like Tendulkar or is it just me?,4
Sanju deserved a 50,5
Scenes if lord wins it for RR again,2
Oh god not buttler now,3
Sachin in third umpire room,1
Sanju was playing sensibly and this is what Smudge you did? Feeling sad for Sanju now,8
[deleted],2
Smith fucked up,7
"Samson deserved a 50, Gayle deserved a 100!",7
We need to win with how many overs to spare to go past kxip on nrr,1
Is this going to be another one of KXIP snatching victory from defeat?,4
"**14.2** Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, OUT,  **145-3**

SV Samson run out (sub [Suchith]) 48 (25b 4x4 3x6) SR: 192.00",1
Why wasn’t Smith like this last summer,2
Someone pls screen record the umpire. He’s so funny 😂,1
Samson is defknetly not to blame there tho. It’s smiths call,5
Punjab to do a TEWATIA?,2
It's impossible for RR to lose from now.,1
This Suchith guy has been a really good fielder for us,2
Be like Gayle and don't bother running when you can just hit sixes,2
"Do I hear Sachin Tendulkar as third umpire today or have I gone mad? 
Please somebody confirm this.",2
Good to see i am not the only one who thaught sachin was 3rd umpire,1
Samson 6.37% more consistent than previous seasons,3
"Suchith should get the DLF Best Sub Player of the Tournament award.

This award has been brought to you by DLF.",5
Third umpire sounds just like Sachin Tendulkar,4
"saying it before it becomes unpleasing...

KXIP without Gayle: 1 win of out 7

With Gayle: 5 wins in 5 matches",4
Is the third umpire Sachin? lmao,2
There's a hell lot KXIP needs to do to win this,1
"Guys guys, Umpire is Sachin!!",5
When did Sehwag become a 3rd umpire,2
"This would be most impressive fuck up if RR lose from here.

But I am afraid, too much damage has been done.",9
"When you get a wicket to give yourself hope, only to see Jos Buttler walking in lmao",4
Almost forgot what Buttler looked like it’s been so long since we’ve seen him,6
"Well, buttler,parag and lord fucking tewatia is left to bat.  It has been a good run bois.",2
Getting a wicket after some hard work only to see buttler walk in.,1
Sachin is the 3rd umpire.....,2

Chottadler last hope,0
"goodbye Punjab, now go back to the bottom",0
The only bad thing about Samson playing well is that ye Gambhir bhosdi phir shuru ho jayega,1
This is RR's game to lose now. Should be a cake walk  imo.,2
Who did Suchitch sub for,2
o paji aithe nee pae rai hai,1
That was a Jadejaesque throw,2
How many times has Smith sabotaged the Royals this season??,5
Pitching outside i guess,2
ffs no Samson :(,2
Third umpire sounds like Sehwag in 10 years time,3
Lmao this review sucks.,1
What's up with the kxip appeals today?,2
Pitching outside surely,1
Blue eyed prince pls bat well,2
"Rahul's taken that review bc why not

Didn't look out",1
Kinda cute how gutted Steve Smith was for that runout,3
RR fans need to understand who is the real imposter lol,5
"No buttler, come onn",3
Buttler to get a golden here,2
fuck me,2
Smith you Wanker!,2
Buttler. Tewatia. Riyan. Archer. They are still left lmao how is rr in such tough spot??,1
Aw man looked like bat to me,2
Suchit guy is a gun fielder,2
Pithing outside leg easily bc,5
A S M R,9
Paschim Pathak is smooth af,7
"Fuck me, what is Tendulkar doing here",8
Can RR pull a KXIP here?,2
Wow..he sounds so much like Sachin.. even Lee said so,7
Why waste review when it has obviously pitched outside leg?,6
Wasted referral,1
height and beyond leg stump,1
Pitched outside ig,1
"If Smith and Buttler cannot win this from here, then RR don't deserve to progress.",3
Pitching outside,2
Suchith has contributed more to punjab this season than Maxwell,6
Tendlya lmao,3
Sachin lmao,4
"Third umpire be like ""visa power go get it""",3
Can't keep sachin out of game,2
Is Tendulkar the 3rd Umpire?,2
"Paschim Pathak has beautiful hair and sounds like Sachin

This man is perfect",6
What's Tendulkar doing as the third umpire?,5
Pitched way outside,1
Sachin is that you,2
Well played again Sanju,2
Suchith triggers the collapse again?,2
Aila sachin,2
Pitched wayyyyyy outside leg. wtf.,3
Damn. His voice is sweet,1
Sachin in disguise is the pirate umpire. He can't stay away from the game.,4
"Ngl rr's middle order is pretty strong, maybe the strongest along with mumbai",3
"Holy fuck, Tahir Shah == Tendulkar????",5
Ahh yesss haila Sachin!,3
Third umpire’s voice sounds like Sachin’s big brother,3
"Is it me, or third umpire sounds like Sachin tendulkar",4
Lol Lee saying he sounds like sachin,5
Paschim Pathak is not wasting any time with that ultra edge shit,6
"Not out, aila",3
Even the dugout thinks the 3rd umpire is Sachin Tendulkar.,12
Even Brett Lee feels he sounds like Sachin,3
Why do I keep hearing Duckfridi chanted?,1
Desperate review no way it was going to be out,2
Do either one of KL or Bishnoi know the rules of LBW?,4
Suchin Tendher,4
The umpire sounds like sachin lmao,5
Is Sachin the third umpire.,3
Best umpire in the ipl,7
He's the long haired umpire guy with the Sachin voice,7
He sounds like mimicry artist.,3
Ailla yeh toh sachin hai,5
Outside leg aila,3
welldone😂😂,3
Sachin,3
Aaila Review,5
Tendulkar the third umpire!,4
Paschim Pathak is a good third ump. Doesn't waste time with rocking and rolling.,12
The 3rd Umpire Pashchim Pathak looks likes a sex god and sounds like the Cricket God.,17
Didn't know Sachin was reviewing decisions,6
"Lol, Is Sachin the Third umpire",4
Lmao what a review that was,2
When did Tendulkar become an umpire,5
That shouldn't take ball tracking to say it pitched outside,2
Paschim is one smooth mofo,5
Chris Gaffaney looks like Barry Kripke from The Big Bang theory,9

Ohh man Sachin again I can't hear my legend do over work for some dollars  at this night time 😞,7
Sachin became 3rd umpire today,3
Does anyone else get the feeling that the third umpire sounds like Sachin Tendulkar...,4
"Suchith is built like a gazelle. If he ever has a career, he'll be one of the best fielders in India.",14
3rd umpire has a lovely voice,7
Wholesome 3rd umpire saying well done to the on field umpire ☺️,20
LOL tendya,2
Paschim Pathak sounds like Sachin,6
Ngl I'm scared now for RR,5
Good umpiring,3
Aila! Sachin tere ye din aa gaye,10
Why is Sachin third umpiring?,7
That has to be the stupidest DRS. What was he thinking?,7
There is an imposter among umpires.,10
"The game is won, the fight is for the NRR, finish it in the 18th and we are good to go",6
"Paschim Pathak is a mimicry artist confirmed, do Rahul Dravid next",16
Anyone send the video of koach checking out paschim's gorgeous hair,8
Again Brain-dead decision to review this,5
Smith has to get them through tonight or he must be sacked tbh,0
I don't understand why pitching outside leg is automatically not out what if the ball turns,6
Not out. Buy Luminous inverters.,6
I don't why I want to comment this but I love Tendulkar. Yeah,0
"Earlier a case could still be made for KL Rahul's low SR. But now with our 3 and 4 already set, his innings was atrocious",2
"Jos don't act rusty now, u got this",4
[deleted],2
"Aila, ha khute gela",9
Third umpire sounds somewhat like Sachin,5
"Bishnoi really needs to calm down with his appeals. 

It was evident in the U-19 world cup and also all through this IPL. 

If he ever plays cricket for India at the senior level, he'll be fined almost every match, eventually leading to a suspension. Match refs gonna have a field day",10
God of umpiring.,4
Samson deserved a fifty,8
Didn't knew sachin became umpire after retirement.,13
Is this tendulkars work from home job? watching replays and giving out decisions while having dinner.,7
Smudge you cunt.,5
fuck off Smith. You better make it up now,5
"Smith and Buttler, 40 of 31, they clearly cannot mess this up ?",2
Wtf “well done”,2
"Gonna need some crunch overs by Jordan, Shami, Arshdeep here",5
Is it too harsh to call Samson an idiot ?,-3
"Kings XI, please replicate what you did against Sunrisers, pretty please 😫",9
What's the Gambhir Samson connection? I don't expect a BJP MP from Delhi to back a Kerala boi 🙄,2
RR with an inform Stokes is like a different team,10
Please bowl specialist fielder Maxwell,3
Somehow even now if Butter gets out RR can choke.. ya we have Lord to bat but match can be interesting and KXIP have the knack to go to super overs..,3
Rajasthan for the love of god please don't do a Punjab from here.,7
"Of every advertisements which dont fit, they could have a watch company to be the sponsors for the timeouts but a tyre company yea right",9
Sucith is a good buy even as a specialist fielder. MI used him a lot,10
It isn't sachin its paschim pathak,0
Can't wait for The Hundred's Armitage Shanks Nip For A Piss Strategic Timeout.,11
40 off 30. This should be easy for Buttler and Smith. One big over will clutch the game.,4
I cant i dislike smith but i absolutely loathe the fucking cunt,11
TENDEHAR,7
noob question: Why is pitching outside off leg stump not allowed but pitching outside off stump is?,6
Please do more referrals i wanna listen his voice more,8
Anyone up for dc 5 losses on the trot?,11
Wouldn't be surprised if we rest Bumrah tomorrow,6
40 off 30 should be a cakewalk with one of the best batsmen and one of the best t20 batsman in the world right ?,6
What are the Chances of RR Qualifying??,4
That was a desperate review. KL hung his face down while gesturing. They know they're lost.,8
Maxwell hat trick when 😩,6
Ok can anyone explain why is Sachin associated with aila and what does it mean,1
We might get to see lynn and Mitchell McCleneghan tomorrow.,5
fully annoyed Sanju didn't get his 50,13
Off topic-Nescafe advertisement is really good imo,5
Smudge saw that Samson was not taking it deep so he did what he deemed necessary. Now Smudger will take it deep and we will lose.,5
retirement me chaar paise mil jaayenge --- Sachin,4
I still can't wrap my mind around the fact that the musical masterpiece *eye to eye* was composed by Sachin Tendulkar.,7
Ok. It's very tough for rr now,2
"If RR loose tonight, It will be on SS",2
RR for fucks sake don't fuck this up,6
 We need to win with how many overs to spare to go past kxip on nrr,1
is this same suchith who took Manish Pandeys catch against SRH match?,4
Why is the ball pitching seen during an lbw decision?,2
Zing lights seemed extra bright and powerful there in that run out.,3
DC must drop Rahane.,7
Harsha just called Jos “Bottler” scenes when he actually bottles it,11
Momentum has shifted but 40 off 30 is still easy.,5
Bruh that ad fucked me up.  Too many ppl in life I need to reconnect with,11
"Too late boys, they will target arshdeep.",4
Wtf the third umpire Paschim Patak sounds like Sachin,6
Jos Buttler coming in at 5 should be against the Geneva Convention,13
"Although the actual MoM will be Gayle or Stokes depending on who wins, who do y'all think it should be irrespective of result?",4
"Sad that RR is very low on NRR, so qualify chances after winning this are tough at best.",-1
Should be an easy win from here which means it probably won't be,7
since its RR we are talking about... you can never count out a scenario where they choke hard,4
As a royals fan what can I expect when an Australian and an English batsman are playing together.,2
Kl rahul saying collapse is near boys.. Shows the kind of confidence he has on the unpredictability of punjab team this season,7
Does anyone have any idea with how many overs left RR has to win this to come close to KXIP on NRR?,0
I am scared of jordan.,2
Bishnoi bowled quite well just 27 of his 4 overs.,3
Pashchim Pathak is actually Sachin but disguised himself with long hairs,2
[deleted],2
Only SRH can choke from here,4
Man this umpire. Now and boundary decision against kxip with Maxwell. He got some vision. Had had he was on Titanic we might have missed Kate Winslet,8
"So Sanju and stokes both in form, Uthappa doing his bit...hmmm, fishy.",13
"Whatever he does,  Brett Lee looks like he does with complete commitment,  Just love his positivity.",6
"Sachin should start doing ASMR, alternatively even Paschim Pathak will do",3
RR have a pretty balanced side. I am astonished they are so low in the table.,6
Can Phinal-over Punjab drag it final over?,3
lol.. who is that on the dugout pimping for altroz?,1
Is anyone else really starting to get tired at Swann?,1
This is what I think both Iyer and KL need to improve upon. They both look so deflated as soon as things start to go wrong and as a result they go even further wrong. Just a little something they both could improve on. Still newbies though.,2
"Honestly, something needs to be done about the substitute fielder for tired players. There is no way Gayle could have effected a run out like that.",4
"Rr is such a good chasing side, I’ve said this about 5 other teams but they can actually end up winning this ipl.",8
"4 down and Butler walks in. You think, damn that's insane, what an insane team- but then you also have Lord Tewatia at 6 down and you think there's  no way RR isn't winning this IPL but like Race 3 twist you realize RR doesn't practically have a chance to even qualify. Woah mind blown, Inception is nothing.",22
Someone needs to tell Swann people don't celebrate Halloween in India because we have like 15 holidays between October-November. Too many to keep track of.,26
Sanju right now > Pant right now,25
Who thought long hair dude sounds like Sachin,9
Chris Jordan is budget Jofra Archer tbh.,10
"Fun fact: Pashchim Pathak literally translates to ""Western Reader""..",17
What's with Danny Morrison and double Ds?😒,7
So Sunday's game is a must win for KXIP after losing today because KKR and RR will both be at 12 points and they play each other next,10
[deleted],9
Still a chance for kings to win this. Deny boundaries boys.,2
Buttler is a handsome lad 😍,8
"Unrelated. 

Just letting you guys know Madalorian Season 2 is out today.",6
"Man, I’m so worried about tomorrow’s match! The evening one.",4
only a hat-trick will win this for punjab.,6
KXIP chances of qualifying with the loss?,5
I think it's time we ban Chris Gayle from t20.. It's too much for players to catch up to him in t20s.. He's scored 10k runs in just boundaries alone on t20.. Fucking legend... Not to forget has 2 triple centuries in tests.. He's done everything..,14
https://images.app.goo.gl/Da3VU76CgggAFM2a7 Anyone wondering how the third umpire looks,5
RR please do a SRH/KXIP,8
so easy to RR with 10 RR and wickets on hand...,7
"Love that they frequently pair Danny with Harsha in this IPL just to remind that Danny Morrison, is indeed, a bit of a simple prick",3
"I would have sent Jof in at 4 to hit out or get out, what with a NRR battle likely.",9
Hoping for another run-out or review just to listen to paschim's soothing voice,9
"I don't know how people are passing confident judgments of playoff success and failure after even just the events of the last couple of weeks:

* All the top three teams lost to KXIP in a row
* KKR got wrecked by RCB and then wrecked DC
* MI looted 190 against RR and lost with an over and some to spare
* KXIP defended 126 against SRH
* SRH knocked the stuffing out of DC
* Eliminated CSK beat two teams with playoff aspirations

You can obviously compare teams on paper and say that all of these results were down to phenomenal individual performances or unforeseen blips. But to confidently write teams off and pretend like they don't know what they're doing/are incompetent is a mixture of ignorance and disrespect.

At its heart T20 is a lottery, and a salary-capped league will sprinkle matchwinners across all teams. Core and bench strength might let you predict final standings with some certainty, but writing teams off in individual matches is quite bizarre.",61
Steve and buttler are the finishers we didn't asked for.,13
RR's match to lose.,1
We struggled a lot against slower balls. Please bowl slower outside off,2

Ah there is the buttler I know,6
"Hot Take- Buttler should have opened since he became available, Stokes opening is just now coming to fruition and that move is I think one of the major reasons for RR being lower in the table",10

And that’s the match,10
Ruined the over ):,3

Time to take revenge Punjab! Do a tewatia,3
the way these two teams are playing...makes you wonder where they'd have been on the table if both Stokes and Gayle had been there from the beginning.,14

RR is a Fortress if their batting order clicks,12
StRiKe RaTE iS oVeRatED,9

Placement over power pls smudge,2
Rajasthan is finally playing like they're supposed to,1

Thank you Smudge. I will sleep peacefully today,1
KXIP fucked,3
Steve Smith taking the piss,2
Smith runs out Samson to steal the show.,8

"Wham bam, thank you Sham(i)",9
Smith might torch us in the tests when he finds his consistent form,15
RR are so fucking good at chasing big totals. Makes it seem like both teams are batting on different pitches,7
Yeah I said Steve Smith should drop himself but no. RR batting is good enough to negate shit bowling minus Archer.,7
Deep Das speaking shit. Shut the fuck up,2
Marlon has really fired RR up,6
RR is so likeable and kxip is so unlikable team,3
Finally the rr batting line-up turning up but too late,5

Ethical guys at 2nd on fairplay award table,2
Shami idiot standing in front of stumps,1
RR are like the ultimate bogey team. They might be having a rough season but almost always manages to beat us. Now Punjab were on a 5 match winning streak and they come in and spoil their party.,4
"KL after the match ""strike rate is over-rated""",8

Swann is a pendulum alternating from insufferable to hilarious at an impressive rate,7
Jos butler I love you so much,5
They're treating Shami like a net bowler,8
is this the first time we have four teams fighting for one spot going into the last round of fixtures,1
Tbh we were never in contention for the playoffs after the first half so this has been quite a comeback still and a better run than I expected,2
Think we just got a quick view of the test series,8
Where are the fking fielders???,6

KxIp wIlL gO To sEcOnD hAhA,17
You might call me out but 99 off 63 when he scored 72 of those in 14 balls in ridiculous. I thought about it after 1st innings that Gayle could've not wasted on dots.,5
"After Marnus performing today, even his doppelganger is performing.",9
"Punjab: We are on a 5 match winning streak

RR: Do I hear boss music?",2

Don't know how Shami can bowl that brilliant super over and then churn out such dollies in the normal match,10
Stokes really provided a much needed balance to this side,3
Wtf Shami!! This is what you didn't have to do,1
Told you guys- match is getting over in this over either ways.,1
"If and only if Unad had bowled 4 good balls in that match against RCB, RR would've been in a play off easily.",4

Yeah go RR.. Reduce that NRR FOR kxip.. Make the path for playoffs for RCB easy,4
RR wins games nobody expects them to. And loses when everybody expected,3
Ok I peed a bit in my pantd,5
Buttler can play anywhere in the lineup. Such a utility player.,4

Seems like Shami gave up and killed the game one time..chupes,2
"Gayle lucky charm ended tonight after throwing away bat, hoping r/cricket kxip circlejerk will also end now",1

Really ordinary batting from KXIP today. Batted slow (especially Rahul) for no reason. I like it when this happens with teams who bat weirdly.,3
Joseph Charles looking lovely as ever,3
How much credit do you give Kumble for the KXIP revival?,3
All batsmen who have batted for RR contributed well today,4

This loss is on KL.,7

"It may come down to another MI vs. RR in 2014 situation if MI win vs DC tomorrow (or RCB wins vs. SRH)

That's the tallest six I've seen in a while.,7
So you're saying....  there's a chance!! Come on Sunrisers!!,2
Rajasthan on paper probably has the second best team after Mumbai and they're proving it today,10
Another comfortable run chase for RR at Abu Dhabi..can they play all their games here?,5
Advantage Rajasthan for the race to the playoffs. No chance we beat Chennai with their current form,6
Fuck don't even wanna see the NRR after this,5
"Punjab were, in the words of Koach, ""a good 30 runs short""",10

Only KXIP can choke 3 runs req off 16 balls,12
That wide helped RR NRR even further,26
Lol Jordan.,8
So even if Kxip had scored 200+ today they would have lost well played RR!,6
Final in a weekday? Wtf?!,7
What a beautiful run chase.,2
Haha Jordan gifting nrr by bowling a wide,3
What an anti climax,7
It was funny how this thread doubted Buttler and Smith to not chase 40 off 30! They are doing it with 15 balls to spare.,11
Rajastha have once again bossed the chase. Great game by them.,5
Jordan robbing off the winning shot smh,9
Anticlimactic finish tho,7
"Effin' clinical.

Well played, RR!",4
Jesos Buttler,7
RR will lose most shitty matches but will chase good targets and defeat MI in half sleep,14

Who would've thought that opener can be a brilliant finisher and vice versa,7
"Thats how we lose in gully cricket, with pride with wide!!",24

Dang these guys made a chase of 180 so easy,12
"KKR will be 7th tomorrow if SRH beat RCB, to think they were 4th just last week. Wow.",3
"Except CSK and SRH most teams look balanced going into next season, in case if there isn't an mega auction.. Csk and SRH would hurt the most in case there's no mega auction",6
I didn't watch today's match and this shit happens WOW,4
Do we KXIP have a chance?,6
Every match this week went in favor of SRH. Time for us to beat RCB tomorrow.,11
Are we all (r/cricket) supporting SRH tomorrow?,16
"Some teams: bowlers heavy.

Some teams: batsmen heavy

KXIP: Gayle heavy.",18
Wow reallly want RR to qualify with this form,7
Can Universe Boss get Man of the match please....he  so deserves it,7
"Stokes 50 runs 2 wickets Economical Bowling Great Fielding. 




How can a man be so chad",26
This wide ball giveaway reminded me of Ramayan dialogue “ae Laxman ... tu mujhe nahi maar sakta”,5
And rr has David Miller inside right ?,5
Lmao Jordan after bowling a wide at the start of the over: *I'll f\*ck\*n' do it again*,6
"Wide was probably better for NRR instead of a boundary,interesting by Jordan.",6
"That orange cap emoji next to Rahul's name seems to be mocking him.  
He HAS TO up the ante wrt to s/r. This sort of Kohli-lite accumulation can only be tolerated in a T20 team if you have a de Villiers to save your ass",24
RCB bc kal Jeet Jana.,5
Tomorrow could be glorious if both DC and RCB lose.,4
Kxip is still the favourite for 4th spot they just need srh to lose one match and a win against Csk.,9
"Kxip should be happy,lord didnt smack y'all",5
So happy for RR. The true underdogs in IPL. But KXI  are still so good this season. They want these two teams in the playoffs. They have more than earned it.,8
"Come on RCB, your luck has never been this good, almost every result in you favour. Just win your remaining games",18
The hunt for 4th place is spicy,14
"Jfc, this Rajasthan team is scary chasing. They made chases of 195 and 185 look like they were chasing 140 odd in Wankhede or Bangalore. 


Absolutely clinical. Perfectly paced. At no stage of that chase were they behind the game. 

10 rpo in the PP, 9 rpo in the middle and a fantastic finish to boot. 

These chases should be saved and shown to future teams.",26
"Rcb win tomorrow please, and then the top 2 looks good",4
"if we drop our last two games, would it be possible for both these two teams to take our place. Punjab and RR both deserve it over our sorry asses",5
Stokes MOTM?,9
No sleep til Dubai!!,6
This is huge for SRH. They're through if they win two,10
"KXIP without Gayle: 1 win of out 7

With Gayle: 5 wins in 5 matches

(ain't counting this match 😭😭)",15
And that's how you chase big totals,11
"Thank you rr

- an srh fan",9
Trademark RR arc of winning matches from nowhere when down towards end of league.,9
"Chris Jordan prevents RR hitting the winning run by bowling wide

Jordan to KL: We even now, bitch",8
Still salty about that Samson runout,7
So now all the playoff equestions are more messed up and my mind is already fucked lol,6
Jordan gifted last run so that he can't get smashed for 6 again and help RR boost their NRR,13
A team playing a must win game is dangerous but KXIP's next game is against a team with nothing to lose which can be more dangerous,7
[deleted],9
8 out of last 9 matches have been won by the lower ranked teams,8
[removed],10
RR now better win their next against KKR. If KKR ends up qualifying over Punjab then fuck them,8
This IPL overseas players have struck good form as tournament progressed except maxi and finch.,17
"If rcb win tomorrow and delhi lose, then that means that rcb vs dc will be the match that determines second right?",3
"RR kicked us out of the tournament, now they're ensuring we're sitting at the bottom.",22
RR has stopped so many streaks of other teams,11
"KL ""matchlosing innings"" Rahul",8
Guys what RRs run rate gonna look like,5
"Considering the NRR, SRH fate is in their own hands now. Win both the matches and we will be through to the playoffs.",15
"SRH, KKR, KXIP and RR gotta win all their remaining matches.",8
Those crucial runs by THALA coming handy now with the net runrate. Oh wait,10
"Every player who batted at least 10 balls today has a Strike rate of : 130,155, 157, 192,192,200,220

KL Rahul 112 and faced 41 balls. 

Not a whole lot more to add to why Kings lost today",21
"Okay the NRR is not that badly hit. We have to win against Csk, Hope Srh lose atleast one and RR vs KKR should be a close one.",4
Csk please fuck kxip,8
Now Thala's gonna knock KXIP out lmao,13
"Unless one of the teams pull off a heist, or RCB lose terribly, we can pretty much qualify with NRR",7
"Shami's return to form and the spinners bowling well got KXIP back in contention, I hope they can get it back on Sunday",5
"**This is the first time when each of the top 5 batsmen have crossed 20 runs in IPL history**

Uthappa 30

Stokes 50

Samson 48

Smith 31*

Buttler 22*",42
"So RR either need a HUGE win next match, or for CSK to do them a massive favour",12
"Morgan, how is you gonna stop these guys?",12
"Every time I look at the points table, I feel SRH doesn’t deserve the 7th place :/",10
Among all the teams fighting for 4th spot only SRH has their fate in their own hands because of the good NRR.,16
Now all I need is for csk to fuck KXIP.,4
When will that moron Rahul realize a 44 ball 49 is absolute shit in t20. Match after match he goes into a shell believing that he'll be able to make up like that match against RCB and ends up having shit on gis face.,20
Csk gonna murder kxip or is rr gonna do an MI?,7
KL: one odd game where i was clueless as a captain,8
Bruh Rahul if you thought batting would be easier you might have considered setting up a bigger total,14
Based on current entertainment value KXIP or RR should qualify.,18
Name one other team which has been consistent with keeping the tournament entertaining and interesting,8
Has Gayle won any T20 league championship?,7
Jordan 20 years later: I could have won the IPL but I bowled a wide.,22
The dc vs rcb match could be the 2nd place match and the rr vs kkr will determine the 4th place team... If kxip win against csk.. The rr vs kkr match gets more exciting because both teams would have to beat the other with a good run rate,9
"Curious case of Rajasthan. They go on their winning streak only during the last stage of the tournament. 

They are professional party poopers. Won't qualify themselves and won't let others qualify either",19
"It's funny when we win, we crush opposition or Tewatia does his job.",25
Dew and 20 runs short,6

KL's depressed face is back.,23
"KL's 46 (41) does not look good when you see that 4 RR batsmen had SR of over 150 and the 5th one went at 130

It does increase his orange cap lead tho",37
seems like its curtains for KKR with that NRR and only 1 match to go for them,7
">Strike rate and a 100 are overrated tbh.

-KL Rahul.",12
"Would love if RR make it playoffs, love that team",21
Koach and KL both used to make batting look so easy but this year looking at thier batting even 120 strikerate also looks challenging :),10
Sad how a couple days ago everyone was aboard the KXIP comeback hype train but now suddenly everyone thinks the team’s shite,15
The calculations are now headache inducing. Closest IPL for a long time.,24
RIP Punjab's winning streak :(,24
"Despite being criticized,RR persisted with Stokes at the top. Now they are getting the result they wanted.",37
"This looks good for England next T20 World Cup

Buttler, Stokes, Archer all firing

There are some concerns about Morgan and Bairstow has struggled with not being in a strong batting lineup",16
[deleted],33
RIP KKR,8
"How I wish the T20 World Cup was now. England would have a fantastic chance to win it. The line up they could put out is insane, the batting in particular looks immense .Four of them playing in this match plus all the other great English players not playing today.",15
This weekend will seal all the spots,11
A rcb and DC loss tomorrow will make things more interesting,18
"Dang, no homo but Varun Aaron has a nice ass.",8
"Wait guys, why didn't Rajasthan bowl a wide to end the game in 2014?",14
RR chasing 150 : shit ..................................................... RR chasing 180 plus : real shit,49

Most importantly team who won the toss also won the match.,9
"That 1-run against DC in the first match comes back to haunt Kings time and again, innit?",18
It looked like Gayle was trying to set a big target for RR while KL was setting a big target for the second highest run getter,12
You never see Joe Rogan interviewing the losing fighter after a bad beating. Poor KL wished it was the same here.,11
"wait if srh win tomorrow they jump to 4th, so rcb needs to win",3
Everyone criticising rahul - who else was gonna score runs for kxip lmaoo those 46 definitely matter looking at everyone else,10
Robin has been working on his English speaking skills,8

Who the hell calls an umpire ""sir"" lmao too funny",19
KLR looks at orange cap: My Preciousss.,22

Things have set up nicely for Sunrisers I suppose. I hope RCB and MI take them down!,8

I supported RR today and yet I feel guilty,8
"hey look, I'm not gay but Swann tho 😳😳",7
Now we have to beat CSK and pray that SRH loses at least one of their matches. Our hopes of getting through look bleak now,6
"KKR bros:   
\- DC vs. MI: MI (would be fun to see DC shit the bed 4-in-a-row)  
\- RCB vs. SRH: RCB  
\[Top 2 likely confirmed\] 

\- CSK vs. KXIP: CSK (can't believe I'm saying this)   
\- KKR vs. RR: KKR obvi, we win RR is out & so is KXIP

DC & RCB, SRH & MI don't matter much. It'll be MI vs. RCB 1st qualifier, KKR vs. DC 2nd qualifier... which means we'll need to face MI either way. Fuck.",3
"The streak had to end somewhere. Nice to see Stokes turn up once again though, another really well crafted chase from RR. Just feel like it's come too late for them though.


Don't have much fear for SRH. Don't think they'll cause any stir and it'll essentially be a shootout between KXIP and RR. I'll give the latter the edge because of the 2 points that they have.",4
But really what a smooth chase,11
Why the hell did Maxwell not bowl to Stokes a left-hander in the Powerplay? WHats the point of having him if he isnt even bowling?,8
Wtf got into Swanny?! Aren't presenters supposed to be neutral. He was celebrating more than all of RR put together! Lolmax!!,11
KxiP: Why do I hear Boss music?,2
Ian Bishop is one hell of a commentator. I especially like that he researches facts about relatively unknown players and also his subtle tongue-in-cheek humor.,12
What's the legs... I mean girl's name? For.. research purposes...,6
My brain has already stopped working after reading all the playoff equations lol,16
Inb4 RCB loses to SRH coz they don't want to face KXIP in playoffs.,11

Mods please update the prediction status,1
"I’ve not paid much attention to the IPL before this year but a combination of lockdown, lots of England players playing and a general increase in actually caring about T20 cricket has made me really enjoy this season. I think I’m becoming a Rajasthan fan due to the large English contingent but I’ve enjoyed pretty much every game so far. The bowling of Nortje & Archer have been an interesting sub-plot. The batting of Rahul, Iyer and Agarwal have caught my eye and I never tire of Stokes’ mesmerising fielding.  
  
My scepticism is dwindling, if for no other reason than I have cricket to watch in October. I do find it fascinating though how players like Finch and Jordan were picked and players like Pathan, Guptill and Roy weren’t.",27
Who called umpire sir?,5
CSK have a chance to come to 4th place for about 4 hours on Sunday,11
"""What's the point of having a good strike rate, when u can have the orange cap and gift the opponent team 2 points""- Kl rahul probably.",13
"The teams who can beat MI maybe are RR, Punjab and ABD",19
We need RCB to win tomorrow and us to win against CSK on Sunday for a chance to qualify,11
There goes my Reddit coins. Thanks fuck KXIP. Now I have to pimp my ass one year earning it back.,14
Amazing how RR managed to chase without Lord,12
I think the big change here is Samson has started playing way more responsibly,22
RCB rn: Everything is proceeding as I have forseen,12

waiting for the probability chart,4
Confusing choice of MoTM tonight,-2
Lol the awards ceremony is a joke. 1 lac for making 22 runs.. Black money needs washing 😂,16
Imagine this: Both DC and RCB lose by 35+ runs tomorrow to pull their NRR below KXIP. KXIP and SRH win their last games to go to 14 points. Then DC & RCB match would be special as in the winner will be Top 2 and the loser is out of playoffs. Peak entertainment on the cards.,21

"For KKR to qualify.

Scenario 1: KXIP loses against CSK, KKR wins against RR.

Much to everyone's dismay, CSK will crush KXIP and KXIP wont make it to playoffs. Dhoni will play valuable innings post which he will announce his retirement.",30

"Why are people blaming KXIP's loss on KL's SR lmao? One of their in form players was injured, his replacement got out in the first over itself. He held one end safely, which gave Gayle freedom to play like he did today without worrying about wickets falling on the other end. I mean for God's sake, look at who's coming next, Pooran either hits 50 off 25 balls or gets out early. Then you have Maxwell, who has scored 108 runs in 13 matches with an average of less than 10 & Hooda who's barely a decent batsman, and suddenly you're into the tail. That's it, they have 4 decent batsman all batting at 1,2,3,4 position and not one proper finisher. 

Not to mention, he faced 10 out of 12 balls Archer bowled in the powerplay making sure they didn't lose another wicket to him and Gayle didn't have to face him in the early part of his innings, considering Gayle's weakness against the short quick ball(If you have been watching dugout, you would know because Scott Styris makes this point every time Gayle comes out to bat). He also almost got out to Aaron early on the short ball, but Parag dropped him.

What more do you guys want from him lmaoo?",28
Reminder that CSK have a chance to come to 4th place for about 4 hours on Sunday,24
