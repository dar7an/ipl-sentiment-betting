I think Vijay Shankar might be playing today. SRH posted a video of him practicing in the nets. He's perfect for the team balance as Abhishek Sharma is yet to prove himself. Hope we put up a good fight!,0
Missed being the first comment today,-2
Hoping for a super over! üòÇ,6
Put 10 coins on SRH today,4
"Mmw, if SRH wins today, they'll be the lead contenders for finals with MI and can actually show a fight. RCB and DC have lost all their form and will easily go wrecked against MI.",12
Who else wants Pollard and Warner to just have a passionate kiss at the end?,14

"Now that MI have qualified (and are at 1st position), it would be great if **Pollard goes berserk today**. 

He has been in good form and I would love to see the big man play a long inning.

Also, I am tired of watching Rashid with his below 7 economy. Don't get me wrong, he is GOAT as far as T20 and IPL is concerned and I love him, but it has gotten so boring to watch this. He needs to be spanked.",11
Rohit's absence has been a blessing in disguise for MI,-2
"So sick and tired of all this ‚Äúimagine if Jofra played for MI‚Äù or ‚Äúimagine if Rashid played for MI.‚Äù Pretty damn obvious if you take out a strong bowler from another team and give it to the strongest team that they‚Äôd be even stronger. 
 
Works both ways. Imagine if Hardik played for SRH. We‚Äôd be pretty fucking strong then too.",172
"I hope Lynn plays today. Feels long since I've seen Lynnsanity, he underwhelmed at this year's CPL too.",8
"Mumbai,pls defeat srh, srh made rr to lose.",4
Man I really fucking hope I get to see Samad face Chahar today. From what I heard Samad is a monster against spin but he never really got a chance to get set and face a spinner.,22
"Imagine the scenes if Rohit decides to play today. 

It'd be worth ot just to see people loose their mind, no need to bat Rohit.",9
"I think Roeat Sharma will play this match and then sit out again in playoffs. He is not 100% fit to play but they will give him this match because the result doesn't matter for mi. Has always been a passenger in MI, but can't deny that I love when he gets going specially the pull shots are a delight to watch. I would have liked to see someone other than tiwary tho, maybe some youngster.",1

Important one for us. Supporting the boys with a migraine drilling my head out! :(,41
"Doesn't matter who RCB fans support as we gonna lose to anyone in Eliminator. 

But I'd rather have KKR than SRH so lessgo Mumbai",21
I just want to taste KKR fans salty tears,4
"I am sad because if Bumrah doesn't play today and MI defeats DC in Q1, that could possibly be 2 extra matches Rabada gets to play over Bumrah and can negatively impact purple cap chances for Bumrah. The guy deserves one.",4
"is this only me or I am hoping warner would win the toss today, Sharjah seem to have lot of dew on and batting first is half the battle lost!!",3
We have to bat first no matter what. SRH has a bad record chasing against MI but a good record defending. Even the first game in 2018 we win by 1 wicket on the last ball chasing a small target.,4
Hoping to see Lynn play today.,2
Warner will again lift the trophy this year.,14
I hope MI comes with their regular players instead of bench. Don't want another Ferguson to happen. SRH has history of getting fucked by bench.,5
MI pls dont screw this!!!,1
If SRH wins today then it will be RCB vs SRH in the eliminator. not good. not good.,1
"Saw a few posts saying RCB doesn't deserve to be in the playoffs, instead it should have been KXIP.

Don't forget when RCB were winning matches earlier, KXIP were getting trashed left, right and centre

"as much SRH supporter I am, just imagining that MI battle hungry benchers coming in today and absolutely decimating us at toss and game is pushing up my anxiety levels high...",12
"MI will purposefully lose today to throw the unpredictable KKR out of the tournament. Then a cakewalk win over DC in the Q1. Let SRH walk over RCB in the eliminator. That way MI gets to win an easy final against SRH.

"Fun fact: Contrary to popular belief, the ""H"" in SRH does not stand for ""Hyderabad"", it actually stands for ""Hamstring Injuries"". This is further evidenced by the number of fucking injuries we suffered this fucking cursed season to which I hope atleast there is a good ending.",148

"Mi don't let srh win

Do it for our kkr bros who donate 4 points to us each year (almost)

I'd rather have that 118 game or the Alzari Joseph one than a high scoring match tbh,2
I'd give up all my life possessions (I own nothing) to see Warner carry the team and show a repeat of 2016 again. Biggest carryjob I've ever seen man.,4
"Honestly proud of the team , never thought we would have a chance of qualifying this season after bhuvi got injured and warner & bairstow weren't lookin great",23

Even in the first match they played against Mumbai, they were in a completely winning position before a few things went towards Mumbai's way which was unlucky and the srh batsmen threw it away.

Wow just read that the BCCI has not yet taken a final call on next year's auction. Whether it will be a mega auction or a mini one is for them to decide once the IPL is over and if the covid situation is under control in the country.,2

"SO this is a cute fanfic for y'all. Mi is look set to beat SRH today. But we rest our key players. NO pollard, no Qdk, no bumrah, no boult, no pandyas no kishan. Line up- Lynn, anmolpreet singh, saurabh vada pav, ADITYA TARE, sherfane rutherford, coulternile, anukul roy, kulkarni, balwant rai, mitchy, mohsin khan.

Mi first up...Lynn breaks up srh with a 100 in 25, anmolpreet singh gets out quick, vadapav smashes six sixes against rashid. he gets out after a blitz of 35, in walks aditya tare grooves 20 in 4, hits natarajan for a six off a fulltoss bringing nostalgia of 2014, gets out on a yorker, sherfane rutherford gets in smashes 50 in 17, , and eventually the score is some 260 with srh left for a improbable task. Back here anukul roy smacks srh completely, mohsin khan the debutant does a alzarri joseph and picks up a fifer. Son becomes a regular feature in the team in 2021 and is groomed by management. ANd then there is a call from SRK for mahela...KKR lift the trophy but then the friendship begins and they keep up the goodwork next year by still awarding us 4 points cheers....",1

Surprised Rohit is playing instead of resting today and playing the qualifier. Hope he doesn‚Äôt exacerbate his injury.,2
Lmao see ya KKR,3
Rohit's in. Lot of controversy surrounding him. He will try to prove himself that means SRH is going to have a tough time,2

"I'm not happy with Rohit playing. Not just because of his injury aggravating further, but his playing either means that 

1. MI has chosen to ignore BCCI and are playing him based on their medical assessment. 

2. BCCI made a wrong assessment of the situation and thought it was a good idea to not even include Rohit in the touring squad. Or they did this all behind the screens and no official statement was given to the fans. 

2 seems likelier. But I don't like it either way.",4

"I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. How is Rohit Sharma fit enough to play for Mumbai today but needs to be monitored for India? There's a clear gap in communication between MI and BCCI. 

If he's risking his fitness and long term health to play for MI, that's stupid but if he's fully fit, why weren't the Indian selectors told that? If they were, why isn't he in the squad?",5
"Wtf BCCI. If they are taking 55 players to Australia , how tf you leave out the best white ball player in the world?",2
"As a neutral this is pretty unnecessary, Rohit could seriously jeopardise whatever chance he had for the Australia tour. Now this was legit the only match where he could actually have been rested anyways. I dont know, looks pretty risky to me",3
"Inb4 ROHIT HITS A DOSAU

T-DOUBLE TON...",3

"SRH were expecting a weak MI side 

But got Ro-superhit Sharma in return",15
People are blaming Ganguly/Shastri and BCCI but I get the feeling this is Mumbai's fault. The Ambanis are defo the kind of people to try keep this hidden for a 'competitive advantage'. They came across like twats in a Netflix documentary that was meant to be PR - they're defo worse off camera,-5

"Should've rested De Kock as well, let Kishan keep and bring in Chris Lynn.  
Good way to see Kishan's keeping skills, Lynn gets a chance and De Kock gets rest from constant batting and keeping.",8
Only thing I don't like about SRH is the way they have handled Abhishek. He was selected in last match and now again dropped. Priyam has not done anything except that one odd performance. Abhishek can hit the ball and bowl few overs and of course he's a good fielder. Disappointed.,4
Ffs Rohit what ever show up in aus loi,2
Hope MI continues with QDK-Ishan at the top.,2
Should have rested de cock and pollard too while you are at it. Give the the youngsters a chance you know,12

"Can you please explain why you would rest Bumrah and Boult to make sure they are fresh, available, and injury free and then play allegedly-injured Rohit in what is practically a dead rubber for MI????

I am not complaining. I am sure Rohit would like to prove his fitness and score some runs.

But can't understand the logic!",13
"KKR fans Relax, even this MI playing XI is as good as any and enjoy the game, 6 weeks of excitement and buildup all for these last few matches, hope we get a good contest irrespective of the outcome",11
"KKR to Mi:

Out future rests on you",7
Rohit desperately needs KKR in the playoffs to score another 80+,13
Kulkarni would have been a starter for some other team.,6
"Man, if we don't win this then we simply do not deserve to be in the playoffs.",6
Last year KKR didnt qualify because of NRR and SRH did. This year the history repeats itself.,7
Even this Mumbai Lite team can easily overpower SRH without too much effort.,14
I'd say the game is pretty evenly matched now that Bumrah and Boult have been left out.,6
"Kulkarni in place of Bumrah? Yeah, that's a perfect like for like replacement",7
I'm pissed to be honest. Rohit needs match practise but with 2 days to go before Q1 MI should've rested QDK for Lynn and Brought in Tare for kishan Rutherford for pollard too.,8
Rohit Sharma doesn't want everyone to discover MI is strong enough to win without him!,12

"Even after resting Hardik, Boult and Bumrah, MI eleven looks better than 100% of other IPL teams. Levels.",-2
"Hyderabad fans, describe your emotions in four words.",2
"its kinda stupid to not select rohit for the aus squad. if their argument was that they could add him whenever they want, then they could also remove him whenever they want",8
"So, if Rohit is in for Australia tour? Will he be vice captain?",2
This Mumbai's second choice bowling lineup is better than ours fuck,8
Scenes if Kulkarni gets MoM,7
"Playing XI has rohit.

shastri : ek old monk neat bana fatafat,aaj peene se pehle chad gayi.",20
"Guys punjab defended 115 against us , do you really think a team needs bowlers like bumrah and boult to beat us",17
And Rohit did exactly opposite to what Ganguly and Shastri talked about.,10
Goddamnit srh will fuck us in the eliminator,5
What a missed opportunity by Mumbai to give debut to Prince Balwant Rai.,13
Inb4 MI-B destroys us,4

"Should be easy for srh. They will play with much more Intent to get that 2 points against a team which has 1 injured guy, 1 samosa pav, 1 bowler playing his first match this season and NCN.",0
So correct me if I‚Äôm wrong that today it‚Äôs going to be KKR fans and RCB fans supporting Mi and rest everyone supporting srh.,5
"Lessgooo, srh please make that poor guys last prediction come true",5
I get the feeling that this is just the start of a shit-show between various parties in Indian cricket. Both Ganguly and Shastri implied they expect Rohit to be rested in order to recover for Australian tour. Instead he is playing this inconsequential game. Unnecessary drama that we don't need now.,10
Even mi fans are supporting srh wth,3
How many changes can a team make in a game?,2
MI has physio too so he knows what he is doing before allowing Rohit to play.,6
Dhawal Kulkarni 50 today?,2
mumbai A team looking better than all teams this IPL,9

"If I see Brohit in no physical pain and injury free, I will lose the little respect I have left for Koach and Bewda clique.",2

Why all you guys digging a pit at rohit ?,1

"hey KKR fans, dont blame MI or SRH if the result doesnt go in our favor. If we dont qualify its because of our own team.",1
I think we underappreciate the gem of a bowler we have in Bumrah for India. I know people appreciate his bowling but who would have imagined an Indian pacer to be on the same pedestal as a South African/Australian/English pacer a few years back? He's a literal hack in our Indian team.,22
"BCCI has to clear out this whole Rohit issue.
Rohit during toss- ""looks like im fit""
Sourav Ganguly earlier today - ""Rohit is injured at the moment, otherwise why would we leave him""
If he's not 100% fit why is he playing today?
If he says he's fit then what were BCCI trying to convey?
Many questions to answer",6
"SRH have used up all the luck for the day with the toss and the Mumbai lineup selection.

Congratulations KKR, hope you have a good run in the playoffs.",24

"Michael Vaughn said it best yesterday. Pick Rohit in the squad and then assess his fitness closer to when the Australian series starts. But to not pick him at all, that's where the questions started. And then they said they would evaluate his fitness. If the BCCI president is saying its a torn hamstring, why are you leaving the caveat of we will assess his fitness at a later time. This is Rohit Sharma, your best white-ball player, not some youngster.",12
Go go go go orange army,1
"...hoping for QDK to fire tonight big..... 
.....needs to showcase his talent today for the game!!",8
"Okay this is obviously going to be a hot take but why would the MI physio be concerned about Rohit getting to play in the Australia series, his work is being the physio for MI. So he is concerned with whatever benefits MI, in this case getting him game time before the playoffs. The BCCI medical staff tho are concerned for him playing that Australia tour. IK i am not qualified on speaking on this issue but I am looking it at this issue from this point",10
Both Boult and Bumrah rested?!  KKR fans must be having a freakin meltdown.,83
Rohit's playing? Why the fuck was he dropped then. Indian cricket is a fucking circus.,7

"Alright lads. Since I‚Äôve been spending an obscene amount of time at home recently the IPL has basically become the highlight of my day. So, I‚Äôve decided to finally make an account so I can join in the festivities instead of lurking in the threads. Look forward to chatting bollocks with you all.",1

Come on SKY! You owe KKR your favors. We are your parent franchise. Go get this one for us.,20
I think Rohit got dropped from Aus tour for fitness issues. Which is why MI and Rohit were so determined to get back. Explains the MI Twitter videos too of Rohit practicing.,6

"Sandeep Sharma is officially the most prolific bowler in the powerplay in IPL history. 

53 wickets inside the first 6 overs. Overtakes Zaheer Khan's tally of 52 in 10 fewer innings.

Edit: For those wondering, Bhuvi is 3rd with 48 wickets. But he's bowled 31 more overs in the powerplay than Sandeep.",23
466  for his wicket is not bad. Especially someone like QdK who mastered spin bowling with those SpinMats^(TM)  of his to destroy Rashid and Nadeem.,5

There's just no weak link in their batting.,8
I suppose Sandeep has the last laugh?,2
What an absolute pie of a ball to get out to,4
They should send Pollard in at 5 today. Let him see some balls. I don't think he batted last game. His form is important for the playoffs. Don't want him too rusty,4
nah ishan and SKY is dangerous news for SRH,3

Why did we (DC) let go of deCock again? And that too after our chop and change days were over?,3

Mumbai should have asked for trade offers from SRH or KKR. Like give us Narine or Rashid if you want the result in your favour.,0
why is everyone trying to jinx srh .. stfu with all your optimism,-2
This over gonna go for 18,1
"Man, these MI batsmen are like those robots in Rajnikanth's robo movie. One goes and even deadlier one emerges :(",5
So MI gets to 150 with these quick wickets. And SRH chases comfortably.,1
Rohit is unfit tbh. Fit enough to play but not fit enough to play WELL. They shouldn't take him for the playoffs. Ishan does a much better job opening. Rohit is a great opener but just not in form or shape rn.,2
Rj balaji's mouth stinks so bad even vm Varga from Fargo would have to take a  back seat,2
Boult and Bumrah rested? Lordy,4

Fellow rcb fans who would you like rcb to face? Kkr or srh?,2
"Tbh MI didn't miss Rohit that much with his form this IPL and form of other batsmen.

If it was Bumrah,Hardik or Pollard that would have had bigger impact. Rohit not that critical,  at least this year.",4
If SKY goes into auction he will definitely fetch more than 10 crores.,7
MI can probably beat other IPL teams with their second string side. Goddamnit.,10
When did MI get Kulkarni from RR ?,1
is lord 3d playing today????,4
"I hope mi keeps attacking, that‚Äôs how we can take wickets.",8
Indian middle order negates the spin advantage a bit but Rashid is on different level altogether so it won't even matter,4

"SKY 388 runs @ 43.14, striking at 153.35!",26
Just add Bhuvi and 3D to SRH and they start to look quite formidable,6
All of this fuck Koach stuff for the non-selection of SKY is ridiculous. Do you think the selectors wanted him but Kohli personally vetoed the decision or something? He'll have a big influence in picking the side but not the squad.,22
Surya wants his former team to qualify.,5
That misfield by Samad. It isn't the first time this tournament he's misfielded an absolute dolly,2
We just see the advertisement,1
SKY has batted better than Virat in the IPL. Simple facts.,13
If Pandya becomes our PM we will truly have lavda ka sarkar,4

"Really puts into perspective how tight some team's captains set up their fields, could never relate",12
Genuine question. Who should SKY have been selected over? In T20is the only other middle order batsman are Iyer and Pandey. In ODIs the only middle order batsman are Iyer and Pandey (perhaps you could include Gill).,1
"Sky would have definitely scored more than VK, but he didn't get a chance to bat against CSK and DC",3
Miss you Dean Jones. You were such an entertainer.,5
Sanjay Bangar looks & dresses like Ravish Kumar,3
"Wonder what SRH do with Sandeep next year. Bhuvi takes his place and the 3 pacer lineup with an all rounder is working well. There‚Äôs a lot of teams where he would start in, I would be tempted to trade two off Sandeep + Khaleel + Kaul for a lower order Indian batsman",10
Jason ~~Bourne~~ Holder is one strike away from 100 wickets in T20s. He's also 20 runs away from 1000 T20 runs.,3
"MI might not love SRH
but they surely hate KKR",5
"Tuning in late, is Mumbai really playing their full strength team? Respect",1
"SKY is the closest thing we have to a 360¬∞ player. A 270¬∞ player, if you will.",16
Surya should throw his wicket today to take revenge. KKR stalled his career by batting him in lower order.,1
How bad should SRH lose to be #8 on the points table?,2
"Why is NUT ARAJAN palying, Aint itNo Nut Novembor?",-6
Unrelated but in 2 months time all of reddits armchair Kohli critics will be begging him to lead us out of 12/3.,14
Glad that none of the playoff games will be played in Sharjah,7
MI might be the only team that can play this freely when their team loses 2 wickets in powerplay.,6
Nattu boy give us well deserved 24 perfect yorkers mow,6
Kishan has been struggling to rotate the strike ffs,4
Ball is stopping coming towards the bat. Without dew second innings could be difficult to bat.,7
I want them to keep targeting the boundaries and keep the run rate up without worrying about wickets just to see the kind of score we can get.,5
Kishan is a far better opener than a middle order batsman huh,1
"To those lmaoing this Rohit situation ...go ask  Ganguly and Gambhir fans ...they were sidelined the same way by the BCCI . This thread must be filled with nubile teens who have no inkling of BCCI‚Äôs murky politics .  Stage has been set , Brohit‚Äôs time in the Indian setup is numbered, it‚Äôs just a matter of time .",-6
When did ishan kishan became nitish rana version 2.0?,-5
"Kishan, please continue that strike rate. Thanks.",-1
Ishu just wants to show that he is only good at open spot and hence doesn't want rohit to play.,5
Is it me or SRH fielding looks below par today,6
Some of these guys have some pretty naff tattoos ngl,5
Srh are like the good guys of ipl. No one would hate them and no one who particularly like them either.,16

Rohit + Pollard + Saurabh Tiwary = THICCCEST team ever?,8
"Its funny but it seems like Koach hates MI  
1) Criticized the MI fans for booing him with the IM CAPTAIN OF INDIA TOO line in an earlier IPL  
2) Brohit RIFT   
3) SKY issues  
4) MI with so many titles. RCB with 0.  
  
It seems like there is some animosity here",11
I prefer 1√ó4 and 2√ó3 semifinals rather than qualifiers and eliminators.,-10
Come on rash. We need wickets.,4
SKY wicket crucial here.,4
Koach is either naive or arrogant,7

"I'm just thinking, Kohli is an excellent batsman and no doubt about it, but when he isn't in a good form for a long time, will the selectors drop him for someone else like what England did with Root in T20? I don't think so",21
Kohli lives rent free in the minds of soooo many people on here,7
"RCB is like one of those people who ditches really gem of a partner and later realises what they've lost while being stuck with a shitty partner..Kl Rahul, QDK, Gayle etc",11

"To MI fans, who would you prefer to keep in the playoffs? SRH or KKR?",-1
SKY is top class player of spin,9
I'm surprised he didn't throw it outside the boundary,5
I want them to try to attack Rashid and just go all out in his over instead of playing him out because they have nothing to lose,5
Sky is out to dominate Rashid today. Good contest ahead!,10
SKY looking positive against Rashid,7
"Can anyone explain what makes Rashid‚Äôs bowling unreadable? India has been producing dominant spin bowlers for decades now, but no one in India currently is this threatening",8
Pareshaan Kishan is taking a page from Pant's book or what?,-5

All hope is lost when BRIAN LARA comes and calls 4 consecutive big over alerts, which irks Graeme Swann who protests that there's no contest after the 17th over to which BCL promptly morphs into a God and smites Swanny. 

With the West Indian blessing, Holder smashes 19 straight sixes which puts Unacademy in front of Apple, Amazon and Google for stocks. After the win Warner runs out and hugs Holder. Suddenly Holder falls down. The physios arrive and see Holder was on Stilts. They remove the flesh suit and it was ***GLENN MAXWELL*** the entire time. 

Darren Lehmann appears in the sky just like the guy who screams ahhhhhh in the Gay Cowboy video and says ""wow maxi ill never drop u again""

9 down babar gone!,1
Commentators need to stop expecting Rashid to bowl his best everyone. Don't understand why they are surprised when the batsmen attack him,1
Babar azam out on 125 need 13 in 6 balls now,2
So Kholi can't play sweep against spinner as far as I saw in this tournament.,0

* Another to give a virtual slap to the selectors, who have been overlooking him for so many years.",7
Watto and Rayudu were very good against Rashid. Good to see SKY also falling that category.,2
Why are you commenting the nz pak match here. Pretty sure there is a seperate thread for that match. no hate but you guys seems like attention seekers,0

Zimbabwe on the verge of defeating Pakistan.. If they can do it I'm sure SRH can beat MI too,3

125(125) isnt great vs Zimbabwe. ESPECIALLY if you get out before shepherding your team to a W.  
  
Pakistan loves him because he's much better than some of their flaky batsmen. In a more demanding country wrt batting, he'd be called a slowpoke, tuk tuk day in and day out.

They can read balls as googlies, sliders, top spin, knuckle ball in one second. They know who plays in high pressure, and look into the future. They know batsmen‚Äôs weaknesses. SKY‚Äôs lack of selection might be puzzling to us, but there might be a factor that selectors have in mind that we‚Äôre missing.   

They also probably don‚Äôt want to take too many uncapped batsmen to Australia, which is why Iyer/Pandey become natural choices",32

Pakistan's last wicket partnership has scored 12 off the last over to tie the game. Misfield on last ball. What drama.",6

This is how we expect Indian players to play quality spin.,9
These cred ad guys are retarded. Govinda did such a fantastic audition.,12
They are gonna get 170+ and we are losing this,6
Again. If they smash our spinners and we let theirs get away it simply means we are a significantly inferior team. They absolutely have to try to take Krunal and Chahar to the cleaners.,10
SRH looked like the best bowling side in the last three matches. But MI has no problem whatsoever,12

"Should probably save Rashid till one of these two gets out. They're already set and having absolutely no trouble against him, no point trying it again",6
Rashid Khan going for runs is not a good sign for SRH,8
I can't remember a day when Rashid leaked runs and we still won. May be it's just the panic.,4
MI batting so slow. They forget they don't have bumrah?,5
Fuck. These two should have been in hut by now,7

Kkr fans- Ye bik gyi hai MI,13
"Kane mama, fantastic catch. Love you",15
PogU,2
"KKR fans sweating nervously, or are you???????????",8
Mi really does hate kkr,5
I swear to God. They don't want to let KKR in. You fucks will suffer when SRH wins this and takes the cup.,3
We fucked up. Should have let him play longer,2
Kkr fans in shambles,3
Why is Ishan so emotionless after he hits a boundary and goes towards his teammate to fist bump?,3
I don't think many MI fans would be worried about discount Pandya getting out.,6
"Thank fuck   krunal ""street smarts cricketer""  pandya  is gone.",8
I don't even care just wanna see Pollard lol,5
Bruh they just keep coming. If we were at this stage it'd be our last stand,4
Get in there!,1
vada pav pro max,2
maybe nadeem is the rashid for this match,5
Oof Krunal what was that.,2
Crap. SRH with a real chance now.,1
Po pollard,2
"Mi and srh fans jinxing each other like :- bhai tum jeetega nahi bhai tum jeetega no u no u 


Meanwhile kkr fans :- enters pakistani meme guy template",8
KKR chuckles - I am in danger now,6
Disgrace,1
Tactical giveaway wicket,2
Can someone pls share the link for the Indian team for Australian tour? Can‚Äôt find it!!,1
SRH fuck this you‚Äôve won just come face us in finals now,2
Time for Tiwary to go brr,1
Krunal was late for his appointment with the hair stylist.,1
Nadeem bowling like Rashid today woah,2
Send Pollard now please,1
"There is a huge prize money for purple cap.

Why did they bench my boi bumrah.

Is bowling 4 overs that much of a workload.",0
4D Chess getting our customary batting collapse out of the way,3
Mumbai again doing what is required to defeat KKR even without playing them.,4
Fuck. He's like 3 Rohit Sharma's,2
Vintage srh bowling...,1
Hmmm,1
Nadeem is the most underrated bowler in India,2
"Reminder that Axar was dropped against Mumbai

Nadeem's sure been hit around the park today huh? Oh wait....",2
"Man this MI line up is so long. 

We are gonna get tonked.",0
"I couldn't name a better trio than Kanos, coffee and catching",4
Ffs send pollard in,1
Bye bye KKR ... sorry but no one really likes you guys.,4
That was a nothing wicket. How could Krunal play that shot? At this stage?,0
"It'll be delicious revenge if all the teams who ""contrived"" to shut KKR out of the playoffs are run over by the SRH train.",6
Mumbai was prepared for rashid. Nadim came out of syllabus.,9
"KKR supporters, how‚Äôre you feeling?",2
"KKR fans, please dont hate me, i just switched on the tv and two wickets were gone :(",2
[removed],7
"Okay mofos. I want DC to play MI or SRH because we didn't look our best self when playing them(like the try ball in gully cricket). KKR humiliated us. So SRH, play strong",2
mota bhai no. 1 has arrived.,2
"Stop roasting my boy Tiwari, he wholesome af",3
Both of these are gonna play tuk tuk now,1
SRH just keep Tiwary til the end,2
[deleted],3
Wont be surprised if MI send rahul chahar now. They'll do anything but not send pandya and pollard before the 15th over.,3
"Tiwary, what an absolute unit jesus",3
Another wicket please i just wanna see polly play,2
Missed opportunity for Hardik and de Kock to be batting together today.,2
The crease better watch out cuz here comes the C H O N K,2
"Nadeem looks at Rashid: ""I'm the captain now.""",1
Awh man double wicket maiden missed,2
Lol who‚Äôs this fatfuck?,3
Inzamam is in bois,2
Missed a maiden,1
Johar Jharkhand,3
Tiwari ul Haq,6
"**11.4** Nadeem to Pandya, OUT, one more for Nadeem. This pitch is extremely slow. A length ball, Pandya looking to work it to leg, but the ball stops on him and takes the leading edge for a lob to settle with Williamson at short midwicket **81-4**

KH Pandya c Williamson b Nadeem 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",1
Khatam! Bye bye! Tata! Good bye! Gaya!!,6
"Rohit Sharma came in to bat again? This is cheating yaar.


Oh wait it's Saurabh Tiwary.",3
Thiccboi Tiwary,3
All the comments saying we will win the IPL are just reverse jinxing. Time to mobilize the orange army's super special Batallion of reverse jinxers,16
"You have to give credit to SRH at this point.

Great intent from everyone in the team. Remember this is Sharjah ground....... if they can keep MI tied down this much, props to them.....",9
Thicc boi,3
Dont know why but watching Kane Williamson  is such a pleasure,13
They look like Swat Cats,2
3 Jharkhand boys at the same time,3
Won‚Äôt get the double wicket maiden :(,1
Crewmate and mini crewmate at the crease,2
good to see that Inzamam is coming to bat,5
Hope our batsmen remember that we don't have our A grade bowling attack today.,2
Chonker is here,3
Great captaincy from Warner. Ishan and SKY were looking a bit too comfortable against spin from both ends. Nattu came and bowled a tight over and now we have couple of wickets and back into the game.,6
Saurabh need some cardio,5
Does anyone else feel Krunal Pandya dosent deserve a place  in Mumbai X1 let alone the Indian team.,9
"1 run, 2 wickets DAMNNNN",3
Pollard really oughta come up,1
Just get to 150 somehow. The pitch is slow af. Wont be an easy chase under pressure.,2
"For a second I thought Rohit gets to bat again?

Then saw its Chonky Tiwari",7
3 Jharkhand players,3

Idi mem choodale.....,7

Feels good when Mumbai colllapses,15
Crumble babyyyy,8
Okay,2
Yep. Sorry KKR.,8
RASHID,7
Karamati khan,5
Where are all the fuckers saying Mumbai was making our bowling lineup look ordinary now.,11
Wow wowow,4
Every match I see. I see an RCBesque performanc,5
Get rekt Mi. Teenager Rashid is still here,3
Getting ready to make biriyani for lunch today. Hopefully I can enjoy it with SRH victory.,3
MAA ki chut this is why I love this team,7
yeah....sry kkr,2
MI overrated af tbh,-6
Collapse,2
"Remember the name, Rashid Khan.",5
At the end of which over will the strategic timeout be? Deciding when to go make a cup of tea...,1
chuckles.....,2
Seeing Saurabh Tiwari gives me mental peace that MI canteen food is not going wasted,0
Bruh level collapse today. All upto you Pollard.,3
"You wanted pollard, you got pollard.",2
Here comes the fat jokes,4
Why take his wicket should have kept him around for some time instead of letting Pollard come in.,3
"MI: ""Fuck you KKR""",5
Congratulations SRH,2
Never would have believed we would see a MI collapse,5
How much more money does Ambani need?,4
Sorry KKR bois see you next year,3
No complaints. Saha is world class,6
WTF.,1
COLLAPSE TIME,2
MI wants srh to knockout rcb,3
"Great glove work by Saha, clean as whistle.",8
"What team is this ?

I don't see MI anywhere",4
YRK,2
He had his tongue out lmao,2
Aditya tare is better than Tiwary,1
Only Pollard and Kishan left now!,3
Ngl I'm actually scared of Pollard and NCN,5
Ahhh yes Pollard atlast,3
"Last 7 balls, 3 wickets, 1 run. Bhenchod 118 flashbacks are strong with this one",4
inb4 Pollard 50 of 12 balls.,4
"MI - We've fuck ton of batsmen lol

SRH - We've fuck ton of wicket takers LOL",7
"Team of the tournament ?

Rahul-QDK-Kishan-SKY-ABD-Hardik-Archer-Rashid-Rabada-Bumrah-Varun

Hard to leave out Warner/Dhawan/Pooran. I would be tempted to have Pooran over Rahul and Kishan opening.",2
MI    ü§ù RCB (losing miserably to SRH),7
Who is this 55 year old guy shouting in front of Ambani's house???,3
"Bye Krunal
Bye Saurabh
Bye KKR",1
"Man, I wanted KKR in playoffs given SRH would be a beast in playoffs. This is going bad.",3
Could be a blessing in disguise since we will see Pollard much early.,2
"**12.1** Rashid Khan to Tiwary, OUT,  **82-5**

SS Tiwary c &dagger;Saha b Rashid Khan 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33",1
Tiwari is so shit,2
Maybe MI hates KKR just that much? What do you think KKR fans??,3
Sab ke sab kkr ki chod rahe hai,7
"I hope mi drop Saurabh after this, idk why they even pick him",1
SRH jinxers playing 69D chess saying their team is shit but they're on fire rn.,8
Mumbai Pakistanis,1
here comes pollard,1
Now this is interesting. But there is still a small tiny little hurdle. Pollard.,2
Please Rashid. Get Polly before he settles down. That's our stairway to heaven,2
SRH have done really well to pull the game back! All credit to them,1
Lord thiccy thicc the thicc is gone. Welp,2
Wtf is happening? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,1
"Every time someone takes a wicket, Rashid follows it up with another in the very next over. Happened three times I think.",2
"It hasn't matter to MI, it gives more time for Pollard to get set",3
"Bruh if srh wins this which they wont , we have 3 great wins against the teams we are going to face next",8
[deleted],3
This is why mi would want to knock srh out. Srh can trip u up in knockout games,13
"Mumbai: i am a god.

Hyderabad: Hulk smash!",1
Look even Tiwary wants Polly to bat higher up.,5
Aalage Pollard ni kuda,4
GET POLLARD NOW PLISSSS I BEG,6
Saha has been so underestimated both as a keeper and a batsman,2
"So, MI all out before 15 overs.",4
Scenes if Mumbai lose 3 matches in a row,3
Why are we not playing 3D player again?,6
Tiwari expended 50 calories for walking in & out of the field.,6
"I think Rohit's general fitness affects his game. Imagine the raw talent of Rohit combined with swiftness of Virat. He would have been unstoppable. Nevertheless, I have seen articles defending him and any comments made on international athelete's fitness are labelled as fat-shaming!",4
Good guy Saurabh giving his wicket so we can see Polly bat,8
"If Pollard gets out, then it's game over.",4
Imagine if Bhuvi was in the squad too,9
Now Polly to play 80(34) :(,4
"Srh fans: Lets goooo

KKR fans: Nooooo

Mi fans: whatever",13
Congratulations KKR you got this now,3
My inner RCB senses are tingling.,8
Fuck... Saha is an absolutely amazing wicket keeper,12
Man MI hates kkr don't they?,2
So another giant pollard walks out now??,1
yeah I think no one likes kkr :(,2
That Josh ad gets on my nerves. üò°,2
I mean Rolly Polly and FuccDicc are still there,3
Get in there yet again you beautiful humans,2
Imagine if bhuvi was still there !!,2
"Opposition is 5 wickets down and they still have Kishan, Hardik and Pollard. The depth in MI scares me.

Edit: No Hardik today. The depth still scares me..lol",2
Saha already coming up with a big contribution this game,3
"SRK must be celebrating his bday in US timezone today. 


Somebody ask him to switch on the telly!",3
"who is Rashid?  


in math: my solution  


in history: my king  


in art: my muse  


in geography: my world",5
Went for a piss and missed the Tiwary wicket ffs,-1
"Pollard is the key, he‚Äôs won matches out of nowhere like a bhakchod, if SRH get him, then that‚Äôs the match",2
You think this is a collapse? We are going to show you how a real batting collapse looks like in the 2nd innings,8
Mumbai KKR toxic relationship continues.,7
"This is a wild match, Rashid Khan is a Wizard, I fking love cricket",7
Five down and still batsmen like pollard coming out? Yikes,5
Pollard 6(12) incoming until 15th over.,4
SRH is ensuring KKR ki kirkiri!,2
Shoulda kept Jayant Yadav instead of newbie Rohit Sharma. The team balance is off because of him,5
"one mota bhai out, another one in.",2
"Wtf happens to us after the first timeout? 


It's almost as if we have to prove to everyone that we have the best bowling side again and again for the last 4 years.",2
I hope Nadeem gets another chance in tests man,2
Our boys can't wait to get tonked by Pollard.,3
"Fellow RCB fans stop laughing at KKR please, we are next ffs",8
And Zimbabwe wins against Pakistan in super over.,7
SRH fans with their time tested reverse jinx formula in this thread. They do more for their team than the players.,12
So I was gone for a bit to watch the Pak Vs Zim superover and wtf happened here?,5
"One thiccboi goes and another thiccboi replaces him.

Hail Mumbai",2
"Not trying to fat shame given I'm fat myself. But Saurabh needs to shed some weight. At the professional level, that level of fitness he has, doesn't look so good.",5
RCB fans are much more worried than KKR fans,8
"Someone asked for Rashid vs pollard, there u go",5
Mi wants to know how does it feel to play like RCB..,7
Welp rip. We weren't going far anyways lol.,4
If SRH win this match.... they better give the MotM to one of the bowlers this time at least,10
Korbo lorbo darbo re..,4
Almost forgot Kishan was still standing there watching it all unfold,5
Warner almost lost his head,1
Nice to see Polly hat 8 overs. Remember what happened last time when these 2 batted welll?,6
When KKR are more invested in this match than MI are,8
"Bruh, Saha is an incredible wicketkeeper",7
Bye bye KKR,6
Mumbai cannot give a shit about this match right. üò≠üò≠,6
SRH is a different side under pressure.,5
Kkr : ~~Korbo Lorbo Jeetbo~~ Beg Borrow Steal,9
"In other news, Zimbabwe beat Pakistan in super over",19
Who does RCB prefer to face? KKR or SRH,3
Loves to mi getting trashed. Ofcause its once in life time lol. No offense to mi bros tho,8
Can't believe we did not play Saha at the start. Might just release Bairstow for the next IPL and dump INR on a good Indian middle order batsman,8
"These two need to take it to the 18th.

NCN and Patto need to step it up with the bat.",4
Ishan Kishan just watching the other side fall and burn,5
This Reminds me the partnership against us in in 1st match this season.,6
Well at least Rashid Bhai's economy is >6,10
Hope we keep going on the offense against Rashid. Can't defend against this guy and get away with it.,6
50% of those googly wickets must be AbD & Kohli,3
[deleted],4
"That guy's prediction gonna come true!

SRH to win 2020",11
bye guys,4
"GUYS, we wanted you to play like you were one of KKR to get us into top 4.  
You guys....literally started playing like KKR :(",9
"**If** MI were to win this , they're taking the Cup comfortably",6
So this is how it feels to be a 2020 CSK fan,11
LORD SAVE US,6
[deleted],12
Warner would've been a much better limited overs captain for Australia than Finch and Smith,6
Come on bois get Polly asap,6
"What are we witnessing here?  A rare Mumbai Collapse, they are not even under any pressure.",4
Mandatory friendly reminder : This bowling side is without Bhuvi.,6
After Rolly comes Polly.,4
"My best memory of Pollard vs Rashid is that match in which we defended 120 or something nuts like that. Brought in a slip against him, he edged straight to that man like clockwork",4
So glad that Saha would be keeping in tests. Man is just a machine behind the wicket,4
Can't even be furious about this lmao,3
MI fucking KKR even when they're not playing them...,7
Imagine if there was a live match thread during the 96 World Cup semi final between India and SL. There would be more than 10K comments.,6
Only MI Prayer Aunty can save Mumbai Indians now.,7
Pollard to rescue MI again! Looks like it's curtains for KKR unless SRH bottle this chase.,6
We gotta play out their spinners too. Still gonna be a tough match. But staying positive is the key.,6
Broshid nice comeback,2
Zimbabwe won super over.,0
Been a while since a Polly massacre,3
Possibly the only time KKR fans want MI to win more than MI fans. What a strange time.,6
I'm waiting to see srh bowlers get cunted by thiccboi polly,3
Ik he plays tests and all by why is holder in the slips? We need his height at the boundary,2
[removed],15
"> 
Stat: This is the first time this season MI have lost their fifth wicket inside 100 runs",6
Zim win Bois,4
pak vs zim was fun,1
Inb4 pollard and kishan destroys srh,2
Facing daddy Pollard at Sharjah is terrifying,5
"Rashid apparently has the best ever IPL season by Wins Above Average.

He and Jofra have concerned more than 100 runs fewer than the average bowler in this season, accounting for the overs they've bowled and the ground they've bowled at.

The next best is at 50.",1
"The thing with Rashid Khan is he will either give you 4 clutch overs or 1-2 wickets. 

On good days, he'll give you both. But rarely will he give you neither.",0
I can't really recall when was the last time Krunal Pandya played a decent innings.,1
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",2
"Now Hyderabad is looking extremely lethal, this is extremely bad signs for us. They have demolished us both the times. Genuinely worried",3
"Paz vs zim was fun.

  


Hi KKR",2
Rcb fans rn: *chuckles* I'm in danger,3
Guess Rohit was the weak link in the batting line-up all along /s,2
It would be really hilarious if it ends up being SRH that end up knocking out MI in the playoffs.,3
[deleted],4
Bloody hell went to see the Pak v Zim superover and came back to 3 wickets lost by MI,3
"This will be a test now, we will know whether MI can handle a top order collapse.",2
I propose KK stand for Krabby Kohli,1
This makes us the only bad team in playoffs,2
Good commitment,2
Par score here?,1
[deleted],7
"Sucks that both MI vs SRH matches were at Sharjah 
 
At least one of them should have been at Dubai or AD",3
"rashid,warner and kanos are prolly among that list of  the most adored foreign players in india",8
Nadeem and Sandeep are fucking underrated,6
"The thing is mi is still playing their usual batting lineup , we actually have been great today",9
Nadeem is truly a finger spinner. He's only using one finger to spin the ball.,7
"Who will win, SRH reverse jinxers or KKR reverse jinxers",6
Who will take wickets for MI? Dhawal 12+ economy Kulkarni,1
What's a par score here ?,1
Kings XI fan wanted to be in the playoffs. Sunrisers clutchness is something I wish we had.,1
"Just tuned in after Pak vs Zim and........... 

Good fuckin lords, is this really MI?",6
Learnt a thing or two from Mahi there Wriddiman Thala,3
Nadeem seems to overdo fielding the returns. He needs to stay CALM!,3
SRH peaking at the right time. Bring it on guys,5
In other news Zimbabwe has beaten Pakistan in 2nd-ever Super Over in ODI history. Their first points in ODI league.,9
SRH is definitely meeting Mumbai in the finals,-1
Kutti guuuuuu amar nunu chat - KKR fans(asked friend to send these lol),0
Round armüëçüèΩüëåüèæ,4
"Just went to take a shit and QdK has been dismissed! 

Wtf?",9
The only thing I am sad about is we won't get to see more DreRuss. Sure he would have fired in playoffs.,6
"KKR's Elimination is the closest one ever in ipl history (0.04 NRR difference)



Luck gotta fuck us right : )",12
That ball was nearly out of Sharjah,5
Oh Lord. Pollard is settling in,6
[deleted],16
MI getting Polly some match practice can only be good for them,3
[removed],24
pollard and kishan still in. will be easy for ~~the aussies~~ mumbai indians,5
Mumbai playing 8d chess by making all players fail so that one odd game fail never comes,19
Polly and Kishan- RCB remember something???,13
"This looks like a tricky track.

140 can be a good score.",2
Even in this situation I'm shit scared of Pollard. So many games like these he took Mumbai to not just respectable but actually high totals.,10
is that sai baba tattoo on kishans right hand ?,3
What a squeeze,3
"If SRH wins this, and it's most probable than not, then they better get into finals and fuck Mumbai up.",7
Polly and Kishan will just bat through the 1 spin over left now. Prepare for a carnage later if they don't get out.,6
*sad kkr noises*,4
Srh peaking at the right time. Won't be surprised if they go on to win the entire thing,3
Inb4 80 runs from 6 overs,4
"Why does Murali go on these long rants 
 
My brain just treats it as background noise",7
How much are these commentators gonna talk about his roundarm action,1
Krunal pandya is as much an all rounder as Aftab Shivdasani is an actor,2
You know it's a C team when Nadeem takes 2 wickets,-7
Not missing Hardhik at all. I love that guy tho.,6
"160 would be ideal from this stage. 

Gives the bowlers half a chance at least. Batting doesn't look easy with the old ball.",1
I think Ishan and Pollard will play out the spinners and will attack Sandeep's last over.,1
SRH fans getting happy over this to only see Pollard and Ishan hit 100 in 6 overs,4
Nadeem did really bowled well today,2
Credit to SRH management for backing Shahbaaz in crucial matches. He keeps getting better,5
Tbh this is the situation where Pollard is very dangerous,3
5 wickets down and Pollard and Ishan Kishan are batting. Fuck you MI you perfect bastards,9
Pollard next to Ishan Kishan makes him look like Yuzi,2
Okay I got it. Rashid is basically Afridi with turn.,1
"My life is a huge lie! Pollard is younger than Rohit!

Pollard - 12th May 1987

Rohit - 30th April 1987",7
SRH will stroll to the target considering there is no Bumrah and Boult.,2
"Just brilliant 4 overs 2-19.
Well-done now Rashid should take Polly",5
"Now that Maggi Man is back, teams stand a chance of defeating MI.",0
Polly vs Sandeep and Natrajan is the only hope left.,0
Pollard is the most useless but still the most useful player i have ever seen..,-2
"Kishan is well built, damn!",1
RCB took a hatrick in PP and lost the match against MI,6
Listening to Murali Kartik is a chore.,-2
Should Mi sell Krunal next season?,0
Shabaz Nadeem? More like Shabash Nadeem.,7
Pollard saving his shots for Sandeep and Holder. If Holder bowls those bouncers we'll be fucked,0
"Familiar SRH bowling so far, dry the runs and force batsmen to take risks",1
Can we get the SRH which couldn't chase 120  odd today in the second innings ? thanks in advance,1
 [Had called it out earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jleobk/match_thread_51st_match_delhi_capitals_v_mumbai/gaovgpg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3),1
Every single guy who push the players in dream 11 ads come out douchey as fuck,0
"If pollard doesnt get out , holder's gonna get fucked today :(",1
"if they dont get pollard now, he is going to do things to sharma and nattu that we will remember it for a long long time",3
This is the calm before the storm. Pollard's about to go big,4
"Kkr fans

Ahh 89-5. No worries. Hardik will smash it out of the park

*oh*

MI, get a decent 130-140 score. Bumrah and boult will clean them up

*oh*",4
"We even struggled to score 120 against bangalore the other day. Lol with Pollard out there, it's definitely gonna be > 150 RIP us Bois",-2
SRH must restrict. best case scenario MI gets < 120,3
Sorry kolkata,2
nadeem after finishing at 2- 19: Look at me. im the rashid now,2
RCB beat srh plz when you face em,1
Less goo Rashid,5
Somehow we always get the best out of our bowlers.  I wonder if we can do the same magic with the middle order batting sometime soon,5
"Excellent spell Nadeem, turned the game on its head. Class bowling by underrated player.",6
Pollard just went to bribe the square leg umpire. Fixing confirmed? /s,3
I think some MI flairs are KKR fansüòÇüòÇ,3
Lol Kishan dropped,2
Music is the stadium low key nice today,1
Wtf Rashid?,1
RASHIDDD NOOOOO,3

"My dad just sent a joke and I can't suffer alone:

Pollard can't play checkers in India. Why?

Because Polly-game-y is illegal",5
What the fuck Rashid. That was an easy catch.,5
"How the fuck has Rashid managed to drop that

Should've taken it easily",2
It's simple catch. Smh,1
Greatest drop of all time,4
WOW!,2

They need to hit ATLEAST 80 runs in these 6 ovrs if they want to win if bumrah would've been there then 60 also would've been enough,4
Rashid khan's face looks like he's about to publically execute himself for that,7

That's damn close,2

Umpires Call is kinda pointless isnt it. I mean if the Review is being taken why is the onfield decision being considered at all?,4

He called Shamshuddin Shams. So cute,7
Umpires call is dumb af,10
Bad day at the office for Rashid and still had 3 wicket taking deliveries. What a bowler.,10
Umpire calls are the worst,4
I‚Äôd complain about MI being lucky but then remembered the De Kock wicket,9
What an escape,2
Umpires call is BS,3
That adds salt to the wound :( umpires call.,5
I'm happy Polly is still there but that umpires call rule is bullshit.,8
Why is there umpire‚Äôs call for impact? That‚Äôs not a prediction.,10
Now a controversy on the cricket rule of impact is brewing,10
This is a really tough call for SRH.,3
why dont they go directly to ultra edge,6
Cent ass DRS get the fuck outta here,6
Pollard is so big compared to Kishan,3
I hate this rule.,2
TF mate that's between leg and middle stump!,4
"Wow, finally some good luck for us. ;-)",1
Ahhh umpire's call,4
"Even when he's had a bad game, he's just soo good omg",7

Mumbai trying hard to lose this. What did KKR do to them?,2

Very very harsh. Umpire made dumb decision which was upheld for a small margin,17
"It's confirm, umpires have something against SRH. Last match's no ball and now this",13
This is why people say ambani fixes,2
How the duck ü¶Ü is that not out,4
Umpire is a clown.,7
Warner is being a dick again.,0
How is that not out.,4
"More Umpire's Call bullshit. That shit, along with the soft signal nonsense needs to go.",7
These LinkedIn ads seem so pretentious,2
PURA FIXED BC,-4
Fuck man it's hitting stumps,1
that shit was out,2
Wtf umpire I never understand this umpire's call I mean what the point to go to 3rd umpire,0
"Warner really cares.  
  
Careful though, you're not Thala. You cant get away with arguing with the umps",25
Impact shouldn't matter as pollard didn't attempt a shot no?,6
This umpires call has to be dealt with. Reduce the window of it. No way should that be not out,6
Is this wicket really slow to bat on?,1
Umpire's Call strikes again,3
Even decisions going against us. Easy catch drops. I'll go cry in a corner üò≠,11
Haha So It's over for us.,0
"As a bowler, I'd be so fucking pissed that the ump gave that not out.",9
Why the fuck is impact even a consideration for LBW? I understand pitching outside leg because it's outside the field of view of the batsman but impact?!,3
"Really can't understand the umpire's call bs. 

You have the tech to fix the umpires decision...why would you not do it",6
[deleted],7
"LOOOOOOOOOOOL Impact Umpires call must be the worst result of a review, sucks even more than losing it completely",9
[Fuckin said this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jn98jp/_/gb0d52w),3
Pooran more talented than Kishan. But Kishan has more of a high cricketing smarts and match awareness.,8
Every over against Rashid: *The great escape*,4
Why tf do we even have umpires ? Ffs just let 3rd umpire do it always,3
Never understood the need of umpires call in impact,3
Can someone explain to me why that isn‚Äôt out?,2
"Smh, luck is not in our favor,",2
What's umpires call?,2
"I hate Pollard. no reason, just putting it out there. Something about him annoys the hell out of me.",-2
Oh fuck off surely that was strong enough to be able to overturn umpire,5
160 will be tough for SRH's fragile middle order. But no bumrah to exploit it,5
"the umpire's call is stupid in this situation, clearly smashing middle/leg",6
Are you kidding me? I'm MI fan and I am pissed at what has happened in this over... KKR fans rn 'Odin is with us'..,7
Can anyone ELI5 what impact-umpires call mean?,12
Umpire is sus,11
"Umpire's call influence in DRS is some next level bullshit. 

The main reason anyone takes review is with the argument that on field umpires call is incorrect.",9
"It hit between middle stump and leg stump, why couldn't they have given out even if the impact is umpire's call?",1
SRH players were celebrating after they saw there was no knick. Looked plumb to be honest. Warner looked pissed!,11
Empire's call,6
"Umpires hate us , first rcb now this :'(",9
Srh in the first half of IPL: I sleep. Srh in the second half of IPL: Real shit.,8
I still don't entirely understand lbw drs. That was hitting stumps why was it not out?,6
SCRAP  Umpires Call Rule  !!!!,3
Can I order new umpire from zomato? That's pollard wicket we're talking about,3
In more than century of pre-DRS cricket every umpire is giving that out and nobody would complain,9
[removed],37
"Sub par fielding today, smh",4
"Oh, man, that should've been out.  

But I have a question. I can understand there's a margin of error with the prediction software for whether the ball would've hit the stumps or not. However, for an event like the ball pitching or hitting in line of the stumps, surely there's no prediction needed because it's either in or out and the event has already happened. Why do we have umpires' call with the same error margin as the prediction path for these things?",10
"Seeing Warner fighting with umpire here, pretty sure he'd have punched the umpire if was at the crease with that udanas no ball",10
Is Umpire a KKR agent?ü§îü§î,2
"Just tuned in,  I hate MI :(

The only day I wanted them to win, they pull this",5
Ambani paid DRS,-1
Even Brian Lara is confused because of umpires call,9
This is the only thing wrong with Umpires call. Sometimes it can't overturn clear howlers like that. How are people ok with this?,2
Can anyone explain what is impact  in lbw?,2
There is umpires call in ball tracking because ball tracking isn't accurate. There's always a case of few mm to cm distortions in ball tracking. This is why there's umpires call.,25
The impact rule is 100% nonsense. That should've been given out.,22
"Bangar has learnt to paly dirty over the course of the dugout ,like that",4
Warner was really fuming.,9
Every game we get shit umpires. Last game with those bad no ball and wides not given.,12
"To be fair to Bumrah, no comes close to Rashid in IPL. 

Malinga? Maybe. Plus he has retired.

Archer? Maybe. But he has only bowled in 35 innings so far. Too early to say. 

Till then, Rashid is GOAT.",5
Daridram mamulga ledu eroju,5
"> challange umipires decision and ask for review

>review depends on umpires decision

>Mfw",3
"Man, SRH guys, i dont think MI will get to 150. Maybe 160 if these guys REALLY get going. But 160 is gettable with your batting lineup. So Chills guyss.",1
"If impact is outside off, it's not out

Clear as that",-1
Release them Ambani buying umps trolls boys,8
Fuck DRS,0
Ambani doing his things...,0
Possibly the costliest umpires call,5
There's no way RCB can win 3 matches in 5 days times. It would be a miracle if they do but it's not happening.,3
"Okay guys hear me out

As far as I saw the umpire probably called for and edge and not about the impact, the call of not out was on the basis of edging it

Shouldn't 3rd umpire confirm what is the call of umpire about the lbw if its not am edge",1
"*Mumbai is the team to beat this IPL*

Looks at IPL table: Looks like they will win 1 or 2 more games than ultimate meme teams DC and RCB in the final table.",-2
Shit like this also brings the morale of the team down,5
Aight bois. We need to chill. Remember we the good guys of the IPL,10
Altroz!!!,1
It was plumb :(,1
Rashid Khan is younger than Ishan Kishan! WTF!!,10
I understand umpire's call on whether ball is hitting the stumps or not. That is due technical reasons. But why on impact ?,2
You know Rashid is a pretty good bowler when giving 32 runs in 4 overs is his WORST stat this ipl,8
Pollard being a smart boi against rashid,2
dammit though we should have had them both that over,2
Umpires call should be only for impact on stumps... It makes no sense in first two stages.,6
"I‚Äôm no cricketer, but I‚Äôm not convinced reverse cupping for high catches is the way to go. Seen it go wrong so much, would love to see some data on this.",2
I want someone to look at me the way swanny looks at altroz,4
Gold Standard of hatchbacks? That Altroz looks like a glorified piece of turd.,5
"I can understand umpire's call for wickets hitting because the path of the ball is a predicted path and has chances of error. Why is there an umpire's call for impact? It's either hitting in line or out, how can this be ambiguous",4
I hope kkr fans don't blame Mumbai like some Pakistani fans blamed India for losing purposely to England in world cup.,19
5 overs between pollard and ishan... butterflies movement intesfies in my stomach,10
"Ahh love to see all the comments moaning with a lack of understanding about drs/umpire's call 

If you don't understand it and ask questions, that's completely cool. But if you're gonna start moaning about how drs is stupid and umpires call shouldn't exist then idk for you",10
"It's easier to say when you're supporting the bowling side that the decision should have been out. The only reason umpires call exists is because ball tracking can never be 100% accurate, especially when the bowler in question is a spinner.",12
I thought it was a not out if it pitches outside leg,2
If MI need to accelerate the scoring rate just find Samad in the field,7
"I thought MI rested their main players, why is S Ravi on the field?",21
Shahbaz was the real YRKFA today,4
"Plz ICC, start imposing fines on umpires. They are getting free salary even after retirement age with retarded brains.",1
Can anyone explain why that was not out??!,3
Pollard being wholesome as always,10
Great ..as if that umpire's call wasn't annoying enough..swanny steps into the dugout,8
Ambani buys umpires confirmed,10
Rashid-Pollyü•∫ü•∫ü•∫,1
[removed],4
Is Rashid K really 22,3
"Why does impact matter when the ball is crashing middle stump. That is not unlucky, that is wrong decision.",2
"Honestly boys, if we restrict them to 155-160 and then don't chase it down, we prolly don't deserve to be in the playoffs.",2
Simon Doull agrees. Anything that's hitting the stumps should be out.,2
Srh fans why did kane not play in 2016 over Moises henriques?,2
Rashid knows that he got him good,7
That's a lovely play during timeout,7
"Warner will take out his frustration on the mumbai bowling. Atleast I'm hoping so... 
Ps. Pollard literally bullied Rashid after the review",1
Is Pollard the best finisher this season?,3
170 easy if Pollard gets going and Kishan is another problem too.,4
Pollard booping  rashid's head lol,6
How the fuck do you manage to tie with a Zimbabwe side that hardly plays 10 ODIs a year with your full strength squad,14
Why does Michael Holding have so many alt accounts? I know he has a problem with impact umpires call but relax Mikey,8
KKR fans must be losing their minds collectively at this point.......,3
"Rashid probably said to Pollard ""I got you if not for that umpires call""",0
Polly attitude hmmm,2
People will have a moan about the umpire's call but it exists due to the limit of the technology and the margin of error involved. It's a necessary evil.,5
I hope Hotstar add a zero ad and zero useless commentary promotions stream for Premium subscribers. Charging more than 3 times than basic version as well,6
Nattu neck beard pls Yaar,6
"Umpire's call in the prediction of ball's future trajectory makes sense because the margin of error is very large. But the error in the pitching point and impact is literally 0.5 mm according to hawkeye, so half the ball's diameter margin of error is just ridiculous.",10
This is why DRS needs changes to make it more efficient,2
Wake me up when MI somehow get to 180 from here.,9
"KKR fans casually crying in the corner

yes this is fine",7
Holding should've been here during that decision,7
The Jesus vibes from Williamson is uncanny,65
We were promised high scoring games in Sharjah. What happened?,8
"Even Sachin tweeted about it.
ICC should consider scrapping this shitty Umpires call rule.",11
Natarajan is a real good find for SRH. Wasn‚Äôt aware of this TNPL performances before ipl,4
Why are people so pissed with impact rule? It seems very reasonable to me.,4
Can someone explain me the role of Impact and Pitching in an LBW?,5
"MI: Rests Boult, Bumrah, Hardik

KKR: Am I a joke to you?",19
Nateajans overs are almost finished hmmm,3
woah Rashid khan looks quite sad,8
Srh never won a game this season when Rashid gave more than 25 runs this season.,2
Bruh he just touched that,4
Rashid : WTF is going on with the Umpire,3
How easy man...this shot,2
Jeez. That looked like a defensive push.,7
"This is a good opportunity for our closers to smash.

Let's see if we can get this to a 150-160 or so.",4
Just checked the score. So KKR whoopped our ass for nothing?,5
Pollard makes boundaries look like child play,6
Pollard probably saying 'Don't worry you're through to the playoffs' to Rashid.,11
The place where the ball pitches and point of impact are not predicted....it has happened.... whether the ball will go higher/ lower / side way deviation etc are the only things to be predicted,4
Non-MI fans who need MI to win are getting so jittery. Fucking relax. These guys have been in this situation tons of times and will keep on scrapping.,11
i don‚Äôt really know about this rule so what does umpire call really mean? like if the ball is hitting the stumps then shouldn‚Äôt that be given out? why do they need to use the umpire‚Äôs decision if the ball is hitting the stumps,5
Remember when polly fucked Amit Mishra in wankhede,12
Polly Power,3
The RCB killers are here,3
Lmao how is Pollard so flex,3
"There's no margin of error for impact, right? Umpire's call on hitting makes sense but this is bs",11
Show us how Warner's looking.,3
Bruh those were yorkers,7
170,1

WTF are those shots.,7
"Mi will end up scoring 180 considering holder and sandeep gonna bowl to pollard now , we are fucked",7

Aasan hai kya? Aisi batting karna!,3
ah shit here we go,1
Lol,1
[removed],3
Fuck you umpire,8
God damnit we are going to lose,6
"These both scored 80 runs in the last 4 overs vs RCB

Can expect 50 runs here.",3
These guys gonna slaughter our bowling now,8
So Pollard forward defending a ball to the boundary isn't an exaggeration m?,14
Dugout is the upgrade we all need.,3
So Polly Kishan show has started,6
And thus it starts....,3
"How much straight you want ?

Pollard : Yes",3
Ump gifted 30 runs to MI there.,6
Making it look so easy,1
Easy 150 for mi from here. We‚Äôre fucked.,3
"MI: *We're in the endgame now*

Pollard and Kishan can still take them to a total of 150-160 and then it's good night for SRH.",1
That bat is so tiny in pollards hand,2
3 people from MI on the pitch ..ambani chess,0
Hoping for 150 maybe 160 as stretch goal,3
I worry about the last 4 overs now,3
I think the T20 world cup is gonna have 2 powerhouses in West Indies and South Africa. Others are okay but those 2 might be potentially very good,1
Srh to take that biggggg NRR of theirs only to go home early.,1
"Even with Pollard, I cannot see MI getting more than 160. SRH can chase it down.",3
Polly ‚ù§,2
"(„ÉéÔΩÄ–î¬¥)„ÉéÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

Halp",2
why is hardik not playing ?,2
Pollard casually hitting fours though it doesn't look like it edition,3
Those last two balls are dots or singles to any other batsman in the world. Fuck Pollard's power man smh,1
Pollard: the only Knight Riders I wanna see are Trinbago Knight Riders.,3
Indian umpires are a bit dodgy in IPL. Not just now but since 2008.,1
I hope MI lose because when they won 10 out of 14 matches in 2010 ipl they lost the final. Also would be nice to have SRH v RCB. Wonder if rcbois will be able to handle them.,0
2 fours SRH supporters... 2 fours... Chill....,2
How tall is Pollard? He is a monster.,3
Sandeep is gonna get smacked with his medium pace,3
So rival of bumrah has arrived,3
Big Over Alert,2
Inb4 Polly carnage,4
"Damn, Saha really is a gun behind wicket",7
Saha is a gun wk,8
"If MI cross 150, we don't have the quality in batting to chase it.",3
"Ishan bruh that was wide by a mile


Edit:Ok that was good",2
Saha saved that one too! Gun keeper.,8
Don't blame umpires. That's the rule,6
Ask all the commentators and experts to explain how ball tracking works and they won't know a thing about it. They need to read up on the technology involved with it and then reach to conclusions.,5
How is SRH NRR so high?,1
Uff! That was a good save,1
[deleted],1
pollard charged up after the incident with rashid,2
"I like Captain's that speak to their bowler deeply, wish KL did this.",1
They all praise about technology and stuff. Then pull shit like this.,2
Feels good to finally watch a match while being a neutral,2
Beauty,1
The show starts,0
People love umpires call when it goes their way but is dumb and faulty if it doesn't. Hmmmm,11
Now that was just bitch slapped to the boundary,3
Too predictable Sandy,1
Mumbai at death is scary,2
"If the ball is hitting the stumps by less than half, the 3rd umpire will make the umpire's call(out or nout out) because there's a chance of human error in the on field umpire's decision. A kind redditor told me this.",3
"Sorry guys, the same thing happened to us. The same thing is gonna happen to you.",7
absolute scenes if SRH fail to chase this due to Pollard's runs in the last 5 overs,4
So SRH wins and gets to playoffs ?,5
"The pitch is slow, all you have to do is not bowl full",1
How good is Saha. Easily the best WK this IPL.(DK's catch was fabulous though),9
[removed],-1
Pollard storm incoming,3
Sandeep is not a death bowler at all. Why make him bowl there.,1
Kishan-sink,2
"Saha might be the best wicketkeeper in the world, underrated af",3
"Sandeep wtf

From kkr fans",1
Sandy! Real deja vu moment from earlier today,3
What a response.,1
lmao perfect time for pandya,1
Woah give this man a medal. Sandeep Sharma,4
Hit me and I hit your wickets - Sandeep Sharma!,5
What's with six and a wicket Sandy,3
Is srh wins then KKR is out right?,3
Is hardik injured?,1
Warner Saha Kanos Manish will be beast today,4
Fucking Sandeep Sharma is underrated man. Imagine if he had bhuvi in addition to him. Fuck.,16
26 sixes in 12 matches!!,4
again!!!,3
SANDEEP STRIKES AT DEATH,7
Legend,4
"Ahhhh, boht satisfaction",6
Sandeep REALLY doesn't like being hit for boundaries damn,9
"Oh thanks Sandy, you just saved SRH from destruction.",3
"Cunt him then he Cunts you, nice Sandy",4
Sandeep always gets the last laugh,5
Long overdue wicket.,4
Bruh,3
Man we needed these Sandeep inside edges today,2
So why do we shit on sandeep Sharma?,4
3-33 from 3.3,6
Kishan has completed his transition into Quinton De Kock.,11
"Man, this Sandeep bowls like he doesn‚Äôt have any energy left",6
Oh fuck. Losing a wicket every time we gain some momentum,10
Sandeep ..nu kiraaaakkkk,7
Fucking hell just when my hopes get up,10
Well done Sharma.,5
Still dont get how did dekock get to bat twice dumb guy got out the same way again as well,11
70% of sandeep's wickets this IPL are inside edge..,13
Confirmed: De cock and Kishan clones issued by MotaBhai ‚Ñ¢,8

"Inside part of umpire's brain is made up of ghoosa and outside part is covered by some skin, so all he had to do is stand there and make a wrong decision.. That's the secret why Pollard is not out.. bcci wont check his brain bcoz bcci=mi=pig2 so dont respect them. SRH will win. MI injured Bhuvi. but their daddy Natarajan is back. they can't threaten him with high auction fee to play badly like they did to Bairstow in first match.",-2
That was a brilliant ball.,1
Sandeep Sharma last 4 games has been brimming in confidence. Economy bowler has become a wicket taker for srh. Happy for him,5
"**16.3** Sandeep Sharma to Ishan Kishan, OUT, a second played-on for Sandep. Slightly round-arm, own pace, wide full ball. Kishan reaches it, looks to go to cover, but gets a toe end onto the wicket **115-6**

"I think KKR SRH rivalry is one of the most underrated rivalry of the IPL. We always contest for last 2 qualification spot. There's always an equation involved. And the matches between us are good too. Mostly we trade wins each season except this season where we have won both matches. 

Damn good rivalry IMO.",4

Out?,1
"How many teams can be competitive with their frontline bowler injured? And on top of that they don‚Äôt have a real middle order. Gotta respect SRH. They always play top cricket.

Also, I think it is a very smart idea of theirs to drop bairstow and strengthen the middle order with Kane, who is arguably the best middle order bat in the world. All this tactic requires is that Saha holds his own. And he has done that. 

If SRH win today, they will beat RCB.",8
Waste of a review this.,3
"For some reason, it doesnt even feel like MI are struggling. If we were in the same condition, I would probably think that we lost already.",1
Lol SRH are so desperate to get Pollard out. Can't blame them,6

They did exactly as said, sent in Krunal and Saurabh before 13th over because low runs. 

Granted, by winning the toss on a wicket where the ball was stopping, SRH got lucky and chose fielding, and SRH's bowling was exceptional. 

But, I was right, this is what MI does right - don't send in sloggers until after the 13th over. 

Imagine RCB in this situation, their best batsmen would be in the pavillion. MI's best batsman is just coming into the field.",2

Saha so good behind the wicket,6

Goodness. What a take again.,1
With Bairstow that was a four,6
Wasn't brathwaite at srh last year? What happened to him?,3
My prediction : 20 runs this over,2
Any other WK and that would have gone for 4,6
if Pollard steps a little further than that then with his height he might be playing from the non-striker's end,6
Hahahahaah. What a day to be alive,6
Let's go holder!,4
Holder holds.,4

Personally I'd love to see Kishan in RCB, we need a top order Indian keeper batsman and he's literally the perfect match",4

NM Coulter-Nile c Garg b Holder 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33",3
New batsman is finding is difficult to time the ball. Pollard is crucial if they have to get over 150.,5

There is no intent in MI's batting. They are so casual and careless.,9

Love you Holder anna,4
Bruh better win against MI or it's curtains in qualifier 2 for us,4
Just don't let the thicc man get the strike,1

Finally gives one in our favor and it is overturned,5
Watch people complain about that decision too xD,4
This is insane use of review system,6
Pandey lmfao,3
Now that‚Äôs not umpires call?,2
Pollard is the Cat today so so many close calls,2
Lmao srh will be pissed,1
Shamsu didn‚Äôt want to anger Ambani da but wanted to pacify SRH fans,1
Fuck our luck lmao ..and Polly looks like he is going to live there,3
These sorts of decisions should be basic for umpires.,2
Pollard should buy a lottery ticket today,2
"3 fucking lives, Manish puts him down. Fucking hell",3
"How is that not umpires call

AJSAKADCBNA SJKASH<ANXD",2
Pollard should get a lottery ticket today,2
Man Pollard getting all the lives today,2
Ayyy more than 126 we losing amirite,3
Neither did we do any crazy experiments with the squad nor are we winning. What a waste of a dead rubber,1
shamshuddin is from hyderabad,1
Off all the fielders.. y Pandey cmon,2
Typical Pollard six off the bottom of the bat,1
Polly just teasing SRH and KKR at the same time. Lmao legend,2
Sandeep Sharma is a prime example of how ordinary becomes extraordinary when backed and supported. This was exactly what was missing for our middle order last year when openers were exceptional and middle order didn't get a chance. Sometimes too good can be not so good in other ways.,2
Pandey gives a six to Polly. Makes the score respectable,1
so close what an effort,2
"Fuck u Pandey why did you let that go four a six, atleast drop it mate.",3
The fuck? Why didn't they check wickets hitting?,-3
Pollard has more lives than cat,3
Yes Polly destroy smash pleaseee anything will do,1
"Wait, wasn't a small part of the ball pitching in line?",1
Impact Umpires call again please Motabhai,2
Srh would have to go all guns blazing in the powerplay. Need one more of that Saha Warner innings.,3
Even year SRH arrives,3
Fuck me. This game means not only we're gonna a full strength MI team against us but a PISSED one as well on Thursday. We're so fucked,3
Awesome six.. but Pollard not getting LBWd today.,3
Guys I thought James Pattinson was one of the most injury prone players in Australia and he doesn't even play two tests matches in a row. Why is he risked here? I want to see Lynn in Sharjah.,3
umpiring has been atrocious,5
"kkr does not deserve to be in top 4

NOW GIVE ME MY LEGEND CRICKET EXPERT AWARD",2
Fucking pollard not dying today lol.,2
Pandey hasn't been upto his usual fielding standards this season,2
"Let me guess

You lot want pitching outside leg to not matter now either?",4
Umpire trying to look neutral I see.,4
After getting hit for 2 4s with same ball he bowls it again.,2
I thought Warner was going to teabag pandey,9
Umpire standard very low.,2
Pandey needed to pull a Pooran there,1
Umpire shams is smart and knows to save his ass. When he is doubtful he makes sure the team has a review before giving a review against them .,4
Lmao get rekt,2
Could have been a catch,2
pollard is like that wet firecracker that takes forever before any fireworks,6
Pollard‚Äôs luck manüòÇ,5
Pollard luck is kkr luck too,6
Come on that was catchable,4
Now face pollys wrath lol,3
Try something else man,3
Pollard with his usual rescue ops,6
"Ball pitching outside leg stump is also nonsense rule, am I right guys?",5
Koach ass-blasted chahal yesterday for the same kinda catch,2
Here begins the Pollard onslaught.,3
Manish pandey has been dropping catches recently.,3
This guy is a cheatcode.,2
How lucky is Pollard? And off course powerful,5
Screw this,5
Pollard having revenge,5
"SRH catching today

Rashid playing volleyball earlier

Pandey now football - tipped over the bar",5
Oh damn,3
"god damn it nattu stop trying for yorkers, bowl wide outside off",2
This is the difference between MI and the rest.,4
No nattu. No full tosses please,2
MI is a team whose No. 11 batsman is Rahane.,3
No nattu's good economy has been ruined.,3
WTf is natarajan doing?,3
please kill me,7
Pollard is doing it for Dre Russ.,4
Pollard hai wo BC fulltoss khilaayega?,2
Fuck Nattu why are you bowling the same balls again and again.,1
Nattu is intimidated by Pollard and I don't blame him,3
POLLY ON FIREEEE,2
"Okay guys. See you next season. Proud of boys they've come this far despite injuries.

Tell the boys I love them",9
Polly with unlimited life cheat code,3
THANK YOU POLLARD,10
Polly be smackin‚Äô sixes,5
"Pollard: OK, that's enough trolling for me, lets try to get a respectable score now.",5
"Breaking news : Sandeep Sharma sets record for most wickets in powerplay in IPL, overtakes Zaheer",6
Brain fade?,2
Kkr has been a lucky team all season they are transferring the energy to pollard,1
Fuck you Shamsu,1
Only Pollard himself could have caught that.,5
"Lmao, SRH fans thought they were through",9
Now bowl a quick short ball nattu,3
FTS,3
Oh fuck it man. All fulltosses,8
MI gonna get to 160 with this guy,5
Fuck.,5
Talk about punishment jesus,6
Oh nooooo,2
Goodbye Kkr,3
pollard looks like  a hunting tiger toying with its prey,4
Dude Natarajan stop full tosses for FUCKS sake,9
Bruhh out of comfort zone,4
3 sixes?!,3
3 sixes back to back!!!,4
5 full tosses you never learn Nattu fuck off.,9
GAAAND MAR DIYE BC,2
Lol.,1
Even in those six hitting tournament that happened after the game ended batsman got bowled more difficult bowls than these,3
Jeesus,3
have fun in the playoffs KKR,10
"I understand there's a process, but it really would make the game a lot quicker if the third umpire could choose the order they checked things during referrals. 

We could all see that had pitched outside after the first replay so just go straight to ball tracking and check that first.",3
What is you doing mate?,2
pandey has lost his speacialist fielder status,6
Saved the match,2
Natarajan being spanked like a government mule.,5
From 135 to 155. Srh smh,5
All the hardwork in vain,2
Three in a row jeez Louise,2
"On a scale of No of trophies won by KXIP and the amount of confidence kohli had on RCB bowlers with a lineup of Umesh, Siraj, Khulwant Khejoria, Unadkat, Harshal Patel to win the game.
How screwed do you think RCB are considering SRH are known to fuck rcb playoff  campaigns, considering srh performance in this match",5
Ffs he's gone wild,4
Stop bowling fulltoss wtf,10
(„ÉéÔΩÄ–î¬¥)„ÉéÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª,4
Thank you NEXT!!!,3
wtf???,3
Hes hit. Fifty already,5
We cant chase 150... Please one good over,9
"If all you can bowl is yorkers, you have to nail it. Full tosses to Pollard is asking for punishment",10
Pollard is celebrating No Nat November,25
Pollard doing his thing..,6
Oh no Natarajan baby what is you doing,4
"Soo many times Polly has done this to us , I'm elated",6
Bruh Nattu bowl something else,4
I wish baseball had DRS,4
KKR with half neck out,2
SRK gave Pollard a call,6
It's not baseball Nattu,5
SRK put a Teeka on the ball??,3
And this is why ladies and gentlemen.. You never count MI out until the game is over..,7
0 variation,6
Nattu got no accuracy 1 Yorker in 6 balls and becomes a yorker specialist,7
Pollard - don't use up your luck cards today. You might need them during playoffs,3
Oh yeah Polly and that's why you don't walk when you have drs available Swann,7
He still has the strike,6
Okay 150 is on the menu now bois,3
"Random bowler against Pollard : *maybe if i bowl a full toss, he might not hit*",12
How do you bowl 3 full toss in a row trying to bowl yorkers? Just give up on that after 1 delivery.,1
Pollard reeking of sextillion7thpower cologne,10
Natarajan bowlers at least 3 full tosses in his overs.,6
We should erect a statue of Pollard outside Eden Gardens if MI win this from here,9
So 160 on?,3
Why tosses though Nattu? You've been so good so far.,3
This is bound to happen when Yorker is your only variation.,8
God damn no wonder MI is at the top,8
Jaddu represent üòé,3
Any other team would've finished with less than 130,12
Single off last ball is ideal.,4
HATTRICK OF FULL TOSS SIXES,3
Pollard: Idhar aa BC.. Tujhe T20 sikhata hu!,8
Bhuvi send your energy!,1
Why did they not appeal,2
Pollard changing bat like sixes are not going far enough.,3
Braindead bowling. Not justified at all.,1
Nattu :(,1
Calm down mr Full tosser,2
Pollard just keep strike in the final over. No singles,2
Every team needs a Pollard. This guy is unbelievable,2
"Goddammit, Pollard!!",1
How do captains communicate when there is a language barrier?,3
Anything over 150 is practically impossible for SRH against MI's bowling line-up. I reckon Pollard has done enough here..,1
No matter how bad situation is Pollard will surely save the ass of MI and it doesn't matter who is the opposition or the ground anything else (-_-;),3
Natarajan needs to work on variations,5
C'mon Polly. Save this drowning ship for the 188937th time,4
Shit from from 200 to 130 to 150,2
Finally got his yorker right. Nattu should learn games are not practice matches for him. He often does this whenever he doesn't get his yorkers right.,3
Extra 12 runs given in that over,2
The day Pollard retires entire India would celebrate with the exception of mumbai,3
Polly's on fire,1
"At Start Graeme Swann was funny, now he's just tries too hard after getting those praises on social media and keeps ranting like a sore thumb",4
"Three times now. It's like Pollard has come out to bat with a boon. 

""Vats!! You will never be OUT due to your leg today (LBW) """,3
Holder gonna get whacked,5
"Yeah the bottom line is, Pollard is gonna hurt SRH really bad today",3
Bc fitrat toh deko.. No run,1
And he retains the strike,5
Natrajan crying inside?,1
"Pollard has done this in finals, this is too easy for him.",1
lol I predicted this,2
Pollard is most clutch player ever in IPL.,6
Dude I'm still pissed that this cunt for bowling 4 full tosses to Pollard in fucking sharjah,2
Holder will be too hard to hit. Prove me wrong Polly,0
Holder vs Pollard,2
I felt stupid after leaving the stream thinking Pollard was out on Rashid's last ball for LBW,2
Boss fight: holder vs pollard,3
"Nice, reject the singles.",2
"Damn this MI, one or other rubs it in opposition‚Äôs ass",5
Is holder smackable?,2
SRH fans salty af taking it out on the umpire.,2
Warner has to turn up today. He's been off pace all tournament,2
[deleted],7
Holder has more variations in an over than Natarajan has in his spell.,4
Someone needs to have a sit down with Natarajan and talk to him about grooming his neck beard,3
Thalaüí¶üí¶ inspired üí¶üí¶ all these great cricketers to say no.,2
Does Natarajan follow No Shave November for the entire year? Or his trimmer is broken?,3
Poly kaka to hit 50 and it will go in vein at the end,1
This match is Nita Ambanis revenge on SRK. He did not dance well enough on her daughters wedding compared to the amount they paid.,5
Gg see you next year,1
"Pollard has gone past 3000 IPL Runs. Among batsmen with 3000+ runs, only ABD (152.20) & Gayle (150.11) have a better SR than Pollard (149.60).",2
Yeah that should be enough.,2
KKR fans ü§ù,3
Bruh.,3
RIP my 100 coins,3
Full tosses galore,2
Aah just some casual out of the ground sixes,2
"This is so bloody unlucky for SRH. Any other day, we would have had Pollard 3 times already. Survived by the barest of margins",3
Pollard decided to hit only sixes,3
"Stop bowling full tosses fml, every one has gone for a 6",6
Mumbai West Indians,2
KKR happy noises...,3
Stop bowling full tosses.,2
160?,1
[deleted],1
Pollard hitting sixes for fun,1
"He has hit every full toss for a boundary.

Edit - except that last one üòÇ",1
Fuck off with full tosses. This is the worst death bowling.,4
Dude fuck Sharjah. I could hit a six here,0
I think I have an idea for the SRH bowlers. No full tosses boys.,7
"You deny a single and do this, unlike Gurkeerat!!!",8
Mumbai Indians are forever indebted to Pollard and his rescue ops,10
Unfortunate season unfortunate ending,3
Pollard has the luck of the devil this innings,5
"dude, wtf?? don't bowl full tosses to pollard at least",4
Up up and away,2
Full tosses in Sharjah? They fucked up. See you next season,4
Garbage,3
we are fucked,3
Why are they gifting him full tosses,3
Ah shit.,2
Why is the commentary sounding particularly amateur today?,2
4 full tosses 4 sixes,2
That was another six ball!,3
LESSGOOOO,2
"Hype af, no need for review now",7
"Yeah BC keep bowling fultosses smh

Edit: holyshit it worked",4
"Fucking finally, the hell.",9
FINALLY,3
Captain vs ex Captain for limited overs,3
YES POLLARD FINALLY GOT OUT. AND NONE OF THAT DRS CRAP!,4
It takes a West Indian to get a West Indian!,4
YESSSSSS,2
got him. thank you holder.,4
POLLY,1
LETS GOOOO,4
Helll yaaaa,3
He just missed that.,1
JASE I FUCKING LOVE YOU,3
Lol actually another full toss gets him.,4
Thank you fuck you bye,7
"41 off 25, pollard you goddamn beast",3
Holder Vs Pollard. Test Captain Vs LOI Captain. Winner: West Indies Cricket.,5
"Take a review Polly, might as well get overturned bc",10
Thanks Pollard. You did well. Gave us a competitive score.,7
Ducking pollard survived far too many lbws,10
"SRH will win even with 170 target, why are you guys so overreacting??",6
Full toss! Arghhhh that ball was asking to be hit. Ffffffuuuck,6
"*Is this what hope looks like?*

-kkr fan, probably",6
bowl beautifully till the 19th over and then just bowl full tosses at Pollard..just SRH things!,11
Damage is done,9
"Why is everyone bowling full-tosses to Pollard?  

Edit: OK, that's why, my bad :D",13
Pollard is MI's MVP.,4
Saved the match still,1
Hold the door for KP,6
See you bowl a million full tosses you will hit the stumps eventually,8
That's like the first time I've seen Pollard miss a juicy full toss.,3
Another shit ball ends up as a wicket,3
Holder: This is for stealing my LOI captaincy.,8
Game of fucking margins. Pollard was out when the third ump gave him not out against Rashid. The game was done and dusted then.,2
TAKE THE FUCKING REVIEW IF YOU DARE,1
MI could have defended this if they had Boult and Bumrah.,4
150 not happening now.,1
Polly is just different!,1
Some Kolkata virgins should offer their bodies to Pollard tonight,9
Is review possible now?,7
Fuck this shit. Pollard was really revved to save his Knight riders twins,6
Holder outmaneuvered him fuck yes,6
Is that why they were bowling full tosses?,3
üëå,1
Saved 160,6
"""Hold the line "" Holder",6
So Holder wins the battle against Pollard,2
"SRH: Constantly reviews Pollard

Pollard : ....and I took that personally.",4
"I m commenting like

1 shot KKR in

1 dot KKR out

Stupid me forgetting about SRH

  


Go chargers or whatever army yoh are nowadays",6
"I love seeing the dressing room reactions from the team, it adds a nice touch",3
review that mf!!,4
Everybody and their nan know that Pollard struggles against short balls but no...we're going to bowl 5 full tosses in a row,12
Review this.,3
"If I'm not wrong, every six was off a full toss?",3
"Truth be told, he a legend tho.",8
"SRH Strategy before match: Let's bowl wide Yorkers.

SRH bowlers: fuck that lets just bowl full tosses and get them out",13
"So RCB fans,Whom do you want to win?",2
Gifting the playoffs,6
Jason Holder the one true king of the West Indies.,11
Kulkarni can also bat lol. Truly batdeep,3
SRH digging their hole,2
Jason Holder inclusion has been the biggest difference for SRH in the second half of the season,10
He did the damage,9
holder to pollard  : chal katle chotu.,1
Marsh getting injured is the best thing that happened to srh!,3
That's the 3 rd full toss to get a wicket today. Smh,4
Batsmen getting bowled by full tosses. Should have happened to a guy called Javed Miandad in the same country some time ago. Sadly ...,8
"Nobody:

Holder : üëåüëåüëå",8
"Like man United have fergi time.

Mumbai have polly time.

Just changes the game",2
Somebody bowl short to Pollard ffs,1
Hodoorrrrrrrr,1
looks like a defendable total.,1
4 sixes and 2 fours in full tosses. How can you get so many yorkers wrong.,1
But it was again a full toss. Terrible death bowling with so many full tosses.,1
Now Pollard gonna recall Holder in West Indies t20 squad,4
Somehow mi lost 3-4 wickets for shit deliveries.,9
"Get hit, get fucked",4
When was the last time Mumbai got all out?,3
What is that 3 from holder?,5
Warner sledging the new batsmen. Lol,3
Are we sure that bowled is also not Umpire's Call?,3
undeserved wicket. Holder is damn lucky,3
Man SRH fans here are real toxic.,2
Don't let the tail swing please,1
"The score is already decent tho, no need to celebrate like that",4
Wtf Dhawal Kulkarni playing. Everybody eats at MIs table,2
"Before every  season I look at Pollard and think, this is it. This is his last season in MI and will be dropped from the team. He comes up with a performance every season like this",10
"SRH is straight up lucky, i think they got atleast 3 shite bowl dismisals today",1
If Pollard reviewed this he could have still been out there.,10
"SRH is straight up lucky, i think they got atleast 3 shite bowl dismisals today",5
"Lmao so one of Mitch Marsh, holder, nabi WILL be released by srh. I hope we get any of them ffs",4
The dew has set in boys,4
pollard's gone but he did the damage already,10
I just shudder to think what would have happened if we had Khaleel at this stage.,1
"**19.3** Holder to Pollard, OUT, Holder with the three-fingered salute again. He has Pollard. This wicket is worth 10-15 runs. And he seems to have got really lucky. This is a plum full toss, and not even a slower one. Pollard is early into the shot, looks to drag this to leg, and is still early into it. Bowled **145-8**

KA Pollard  b Holder 41 (25b 2x4 4x6) SR: 164.00",1
I still confuse Kulkarni for Rahane at times. Cricket doppelgangers,4
All ok,2
Has Mumbai ever lost beyond 5 wickets this ipl?,5
Holder rarely celebrates or shows emotion.,6
"Wow, MI screwing KKR. No one wants Captain Morgan in the play offs...fair enough, would've been an easy win for them otherwise",1
Wtf Rahane you can't bat today after scoring a fifty yesterday,14
[By the way. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CricketShitpost/comments/jgfyjj/ipl_2020_orange_cap_holder/),2
Chahar needed batting practice man.,3
Sending Rahane at Number 10 is not so great idea,8
Tall rahane on strike,6
They still have Rahane batting,11
"I think RCB should also cheer for MI, considering RCB'S records against SRH in playoffs",11
Rahane at number 10?,2
Pollard hit 4 sixes of full tosses. If it was another ground like Dubai then 3 off them would be caught inside field,10
Dhawal Kulkarni looks like Ajinkya Rahane lost his will to live..,9
Hate that tongue twister ad,4
that interim captaincy might have helped Pollard assume some responsibility there,3
What‚Äôs Warner saying to the incoming Mumbai batsman?,16
~~Boom Boom Bumrah~~ Dhoom Dhoom Dhawal.,7
Fucking hell the commentators sound like regular people drinking and talking over each other,6
Bhenchod umpire nahi hota toh we could've gotten less than 120,9
What does Holder‚Äôs celebration signify?,5
"Less one 150.
Come on Warner play a blinder today",2
SRH should still chase this with Warner playing anchor,5
"This SRH team looks so fucking scary, they are gonna wipe the floor with us lmao",9
Pollard hs done enough damage I think...,7
Having a giant like pollard really helps in sharjah,10
Three Rahane's at RR were too much. Spreading out his seed this season.,11
Too sweet holder....too sweet,3
Ajinkya Rahane playing for MI,7
Dhawal Kulkarni masterclass with the ball would be the ending the league phase deserves.,2
"Tbh 150 is still a decent score

Considering the pitch ain‚Äôt the best",8
Typical srh squeeze . Such a dangerous team .,6
only thing that gives me hope for SRH with its batting is that Warner doesnt have to face Bumrah.,3
Why is Rahane batting this low in the order,8
Okay 150 is really for dinner today,1
What is the par score here for last few games?,0
Why is Ajinkya Rahane batting for MI at number 10,1
Fuck it hit him in the back of the neck!!!!!!!!,1
Kulkarni and rahane are cousins?,7
Sadly Rashid will be today's MOTM if MI wins,-2
Please defend this,4
Gg,2
"Who'll be Warner's predator today? Boult or Bumrah. I'd say Bumrah
Edit: this is fucked up then",1
Omg he looks so like Rahane in that helmet,1
Rahane should have batted higher. Wasted at that position,6
Boink,2
This is why Sachin told to wear helmet everytime,17
Rahane is playing at 10 for MI.,16
"Honestly, I don‚Äôt know if we can chase 150.",10
Dhawal got patt se headshot,7
Why is Rahane batting at number 10?,18
"I guess Warner would have easily taken 150 at the start of this match. Despite Pollard's sixes, it was a good job from SRH overall.",6
6d chess by fielder to injure their opening bowler before batting,14
Saha's wicketkeeping was the reason for this score.,7
So Kulkarni passed all of his luck to Pollard eh,3
Omg you just triggered lord kulkarni,3
Wear your helmet boys,9
Shit that was close,2
Good Game,3
Patt se headshot!!!,5
Concussion sub Bumrah for Kulkarni... üòÇ,20
Never knew Rahane has so many twin brothers,27
Tf how is Dhawal okay after that,6
"Said it before, Nattu is a pretty ordinary braindead bowler barring those yorkers.",7
Damn.. Seems like Varun Chakravorty failed No shave November,3
[deleted],4
Kulkarni looks like rahane,5
We gotta back ourselves,3
That's why you were a fucking helmet even when facing spinners.,23
What‚Äôs with all the Rahane comments?,2
"Soo.. Did Manish Pandey drop the match? 

Could have easily been a sub par 125 total.",4
Headshot,3
We need a Rahane look-alike XI,7
We struggled in 120s chases now 150 yeah good luck.,5
Lmao holder in the background,3
4 full tosses 24 runs. Fuck,7
Natarajan needs to trust himself more. He was unplayable in his first two overs bowling into the pitch and then got smacked to all parts with faild yorker spam,8
Dhawal was like can you give me some massage,3
That's why helmets must be made mandatory for all 20 overs. That could've happened in a spinner's over and could have been disastrous,21
Never forget to cover your head,3
Please don't bottle this Boisüôèüôèüôèüôè,3
That could have been Boult/Bumrah's head,11
150 is defendable if Warner and Kanos get out asap. No bumrah no party :(,3
Hope he is fine,5
Shahbaz Nadeem is a true bro,10
Shades of the world cup final. Hemet not as good as a bat in getting the ball to the boundary.,3
"Mumbai 140's score with Rohit? 
No bumrah though",2
Ajinkya Rahane n o with 150 sr,3
Sniper Warner.,7
Hope Rahane is ok. That throw was hard,12
What if Kulkarni was not wearing a helmet cos the bowler was a spinner,4
Now just imagine if the same thing happened to a player who had removed their helmet because a spinner was bowling?,11
SRH will take 150 runs against strong MI,4
"And this is why you should always wear helmet, even against spinners",10
How fucked are SRH on scale of 0 to 0?,3
"Fuck, I was hoping we could play KKR in the play-offs but it's looking more like SRH who just happen to be in red hot form..",4
Holder's expression when Kulkarni got hit lol.,5
How tf is 150 at sharjah an 'at par' score ?,2
That broke his helmet.... tf I hope he's okay,8
Bc plz wear helmet even when spin is bowling,15
incoming kulkarni fiery revenge spell story arc.,10
Somehow crawled our way to almost 150. Mumbai makes it work one way or the other,11
I want Warner to go full bonkers,7
One piece of that helmet just flew,10
Kulkarni is more rahane then rahane,25
And no signs of dew today :( I dont see the team using towels... luck going against us,7
If there wasn't the Stem guard on his helmet....,8
Pro CSGO player Warner gets a headshot,20
"MI batting so good, Rahane us literally at number 10",14
God that was a real shit show with the bat. Getting Sky really changed the game.,8
Mumbai so star studded that Rahane has to bat at no 10 for them,63
should have been 10-15 runs lesser,5
Warner should be peppered enough to come out wild swinging,3
"Bruh 30 over par for us 

Fingers crossed",9
"Good strategy, hit the MI bowler so they can't bowl",9
Unlike MI we have to hit in the pp and try to get 50-60 runs. Easier said that done tho tbf,4
Watching IPL my natural preferences of teams seems to be Csk>rcb>kxip>srh>???,2
Why does Mumbai send Krunal ahead of Pollard? Stoopid af,2
"Crazy that Holder went for 10 and yet that would be widely considered as a good over. 

Even 5 years ago 10 an over represented a failure.",3
If we can't chase this while they have no Bumrah or Boult we deserve to lose,13
[deleted],3
5D Chess by Warner. Incapacitating Rahane before the Test series.,12
"If Manish pandey doesn't eat dot balls , I'll be grateful",9
"If concussion rules apply here, Bumrah can be Dhaval‚Äôs substitute. Never thought such a scenario would ever arise ü§£",6
"He wasn't even aiming for the stumps there was he, that was too perfect of a headshot",1
"Mom: ‚Äúwe have Rahane at home‚Äù

Rahane at home:",16
SRH has been the best bowling unit of any IPL season since the time they arrived. Period.,37
I need swannys confidence,1
"Warner didn't have to do that.

Now dhawal is going to pick 5er",5
Dew please dew please,9
"Bullseye. Damn, players should wear helmets when spinners are bowling too. We saw 3D getting hit as well",10
"NGL had Pollard connected that one I think it would've gone across the road outside the ground, he put so much in that shot he literally spun",8
"Reasonable score. MI have a chance, if they are arsed about it. 

On the Rohit thing, I can‚Äôt understand if it‚Äôs some kind of power play from one side or if it‚Äôs just the usual administrative clusterfuck (lack of communication etc.)",6
What the fucking monster of a team MI is... Even after so much damage they scored 150 odd..,29
Need a warner special here to pull this off,9
MI has a history with 149-8,8
Jason Holder is a mans man. True leader,10
"If we can‚Äôt chase 150, good luck KKR, hope y‚Äôall do well",5
"If MI wins this, KKR should get a pavallion at Eden Gardens after Pollard.",6
"Oh shit just realised my stream has dugout commentary, that's why it sounds so unprofessional",3
This game is done. Gratz KKR on 4th place,4
Nadeem is so underrated. Loved his years with Delhi,-2
"
""Wear helmet at the back also"" - Sachin",10
There's no dew today?,0
Rcb fans will be supporting MI for the first time so that they can face KKR in the eliminator,5
"Writers got really lazy with this one. Copy pasted ""Six and Bowled"" bunch of times to fill today's script.",6
MI rests key bowlers and then sets target of just 150. It's SRH's match to lose.,1
Fucking make helmets compulsory,3
"MI has a good total, this can go anyway",1
"Less than 150 on Sharjah with no Boult, Bumrah against the likes of Dhawal Kulkarni should be easily gettable for SRH",6
"You simply don't headshot a guy ,who is about to walk out to bowl now. Lets hope a fierce spell from Varun Chakravorty",2
SRH should send someone like Rashid in top 3 to just score a quick 30 so the other professional test players can feel like home,12
Incoming DK redemption arc,2
T Nattu getting smashed because it is No Nut November,10
wipe yourself down sounds kinda passive aggresive,4
"Alright KKR...... Pollard probably got you off the ventilator and breathing on your own a bit!!!!!

Pray to Goddess Durga like Navratri is still going on!!!!! :D",10
Dread it. Run from it. 150 still arrives.,5
Damn! Dhawal Kulkarni is our second best Indian pacer!,5
Late but why tf was pollard not out against rashid. Wickets were hitting,2
Hoping Pollard's innings means the pitch has quickened up,1
"Mark my words:

Sunrisers will lose.

In this wicket Mumbai actually has very effective bowling lineup",8
Nattu's career will be decided by how well he evolves with other tools once batsmen start pre meditating for the yorkers,8
I want to see a beast Warner and an aggressive Manish today. Otherwise it would be tough for us.,8
When Mini Rahane got hit ‚Äî kasam se gotiya muh mai aa gyi thi. (got shit scared.),8
"Sheesh this is one heck of a side MI!

They lost 8 wickets but still managed 149

Meanwhile RCB were looking for 150 even when Devdutt Paddikal was going all guns blazing.",22
Rip to us KKR fans,3
Do we have dew tonight? Otherwise 150 seems difficult tbh even without Bumrah/boult,4
Kulkarni has always destroyed Hyderabad based teams,10
"SRH will get this maybe in the 19th over. ~~Need to  see off Bumrah~~

Edit: No Bumrah",2
Game on KKR boys,5
Question to MI fans- Don't you think that your team is really OP ? And neatly undefeatable? If not then why?,14
[KKR](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/El5I6IwVcAEm7pn?format=jpg&name=medium),11
"Call me Superstitious ,but Rohit Sharma is bad luck for KKR",12
Lmao KKR being treated as punching bags seeing the way RCB fans and MI prefer facing them instead of us,18
Do you think MI could've defended 149 here if Bumrah and Boult were there?,8
Hope Holder does what Pollard did with the bat,10
This is completely upto Pandey and Williamson.,4
"Despite being a RCB fan, I wasn't really furious at the way RCB batsmen performed in last 4 games. Batting 1st in last 2 weeks has been super difficult for any team unless the bowling team isn't in rhythm.",10
"Natrajan this season
Yorkers = 30+
Full tossess= 100+",10
"Restricting MI to 150 when they‚Äôre only resting Hardik from their batting lineup is very impressive. 150 chase to save the season, this should be very gettable with no Bumrah/Boult too.",12
"65% chance of SRH winning. 

Without Boult/Bumrah it's more like 80%.",11
So final‚Äôs gonna be a rematch,8
We really missed Hardik today,7
So Rohit will play in the Aussie tour ?,5
I don't really think dc and rcb stand a chance against this SRH. Guess it will be these 2 teams again this day next week.,16
Pollard without a doubt is MI's GOAT.,49
Most important wicket is Kane Williamsons. His style is made for this pitch.,14
This is why helmet must be made compulsory throughout the match.,29
4 full tosses are going to cost the match now. Such a monstrosity,16
MI is reaching 90's Chicago Bulls level of domination in IPL,16
Lara is brilliant with his predictions on dugout. Assesses the game so well,28
Hardik - > Holder would have been great to watch...,6
If Bhuvi wasnt injured SRH would be in top 2 by now,31
Pollard has been the best batsman this IPL don't @ me,11
"Honestly MI has a ridiculous batting lineup. Hitman, QDK, Sky, Kishan, Hardik, Pollard are all matchwinners. And on top of that boult and bumrah. Ambani remains true to himself..winning everywhere.",20
My friend said he had a dream the other day of KKR and Delhi in the finals and Delhi was 90/6 with Stoinis batting so clearly we're going to lose this.,19
"Natarajan back to back full tosses. It just seemed like he went crazy.

I think natarajan should have more in his arsenal than just yorkers",11
"53 powerplay wickets for Sandeep, goddamn",18
Nattu's beard makes kinda makes him look like a goat. Not the GOAT he'd like to be.,26
"If Warner doesn't gift his wicket to Krunal Pandya by trying to be ultra aggressive, the match is ours. And no reverse sweeps please, The pace of the wicket is too inconsistent for them.",11
"If you can‚Äôt score 150 at Sharjah against this bowling attack, you deserve to be out.",-15
Question to RCB fans- Don't you think that your team is really OP ? And neatly undefeatable? If not then why?/s (inspired by another comment on mi),7
"Catches win matches, that Pollard drop by Manish is the game changer. Still would take 150",4
What does that Holder Celebration signify ? Similar to this emoji 'üëå',6
Jason Holders arm is longer than my whole body.,18
[deleted],5
Warner 100 today. He's gotta be pumped,7
Still 20 runs above par,5
The bowling was good considering rashid wasnt in touch today,10
Ah we would've scored the same with the loss of 4 wickets,16
Rcb fans what if we really win the eliminator?,3
Deepak Chahar or Sandeep Sharma?,3
"Commendable bowling from SRH, gives me hope that if Rashid and Nattu fail, you have the others to step up. 

Though will admit Rashid was unlucky tonight, esp with Pollard.",10
"In before all the mental gymnastics Cricinfo does to come up with smart stats to predict the impact of dropped catch, overturned DRS call etc.",9
"I'm really disappointed RCB.. How could they qualify to the Playoffs without giving their fans scare till the end point of the leaque.. Watching RCB fans relaxed is very uncomfortable... Classic RCB would have lost the game on 17.4 and managed to get hit for a six on the last ball ending in thier NRR drop, only for thier fans to be on the edge of the seat this match",9
Make Saha open the innings please. The thought of Warner getting out keeps getting into my head,5
Hope Dhawal Kulkarni is okay after being hit on the head. Batsmen need to wear helmet at all times. I hope ICC make this mandatory before anything serious happens.,23
"Since the playoffs format was started in 2011, two teams that have finished in the top 2 but still failed to qualify for the finals - Delhi in 2012 and Gujarat Lions in 2016.",5
Sandeep already played over 90 IPL games wow,6
"I cant believe we almost pulled of a 130s scored vs MI even when they were batting full strength lol (except hardik, but he doesn't have a great record against SRH anyway).",4
On a scale of 1 to 10 how overrated was Dhoni from 2015-19,-13
"If SRH wins today, Rashid after today's performance is going to run through either RCB or DC/MI in Q2. It's crazy that for most bowlers that would be a decent performance but for Rashid it's a bad day.",22
"I actually respect SRH. Please fuck Mumbai good!

Thanks!!",2
Rashid and Saha to open please!,3
Natarajan first 2 overs 7 runs. Next 2 overs 31 runs.,11
Can someone explain the history behind Holder's sign?,7
Keep calm and believe in Davy and Kanos. Big match players will deliver.,12
SRH chase this down please üôè,6
"if mi win today start building that pollard statue outside eden gardens.

we will begin building a shreyas iyer statue soon",11
Why do i feel we will really win the cup this time? What if it really happens?,0
NGL the IPL theme is pretty sick,10
"Fuck off with your 'x deserves to be in playoffs' bs, they will be in playoff if they got enough points to qualify for it. If they dont get the points and NRR required, they dont deserve to qualify. This is a league, why the fuck cant some of you fucks understand it?",33
Any chance bumrah comes as concussion sub for Dhawal?,8
"If Saha scores three successive hundreds, would he make it to Indian T20 team?",5
I believe Natarajan is going to Australia as a net bowler. I hope Indian bowling coaching set up helps him working on other bowls. These Yorkers with additional full tosses are getting too predictable.,11
[removed],5
"For an IPL team, having a squad like MI should be illegal.",8
"How is the fair play awarded if 2 teams are on the same points... Currently KKR, csk, mi are all on 10.2",2
Chances alive for SRH as long as Dhawal Lulkarni is there.,3
Would MI retain Krunal before a mega Auction?,1
"I hope its not NCN, Kulkarni or chahars day today...last time Lockie screwed us over",6
"SRH could've won this without those big sixes by Pollar in the end, now it's a toss-up",3
"I think we are not giving enough respect to D Kulkarni, he is a good bowler and I am happy to see him bowl atleast in this match, hope he does well.",2
"Offtopic:

Whenever I sit down to study I feel tired and and lose focus. Any advice?",8
"Please don't let that guy's predictions come true, i want rcb or delhi to win",5
Shout out for Saha. Excellent saves today. Easily one of the best keepers in this IPL.,7
"Mi were better with kishan as opener, if rohit is out of form, send him at 4.... He will be better than tiwary on most days",8
Warner 70(32) coming up.....,3
"SRH, please take it to the last over please",2
"Nataranjan reminds me of old school Pakistan bowlers, just aggressive yorkers. If the batsman misses they hit.",4
"really like srh, but after they bottled that 126 chase, my expectations have stayed low",5
"Rohit's puzzled look at watching SKY and Kulkarni warming up as they get onto the field is hilarious.

'*Yeh kya kar rahe hain yeh log*?'",6
Saha should stay till the middle overs. The second best player of spin this tournament after SKY.,3
Hopefully we see a Davis Warner classic. I don‚Äôt want to see him play a tuk tuk innings. I would much rather have him get out why trying in the pp,2
"If we win this game, we probably have to play RCB, DC and MI again to win the title.",8
"Why is it whenever mi collapse, polly always steps up, takes them to 140s and mi end up winning 9/10 times",4
"Now or never Bois, come on üî•üî•",1
"If umpires had a Fairplay leader board, S Ravi would be at -120 points",2
"Has to be one of the unluckiest batting day for MI

Qdk n IshKish inside edging full n wide balls into stumps

SKY wierd stumping without dancing down the pitch

Pollard getting bowled in a juicy full toss",9
pollard literally a game changer with those sixes goddamn,2
Another member of the Rahane clone club,3
"Remember guys:

SRH tail starts at 4

Thank you.",5
"MI batting is like Hydra, no matter how many you get out they still keep coming",5
Now watch as Shavey Davey gets out in the first over,2
Rahane starts off with a wide.,5
"A bit harsh maybe, but I hope they leave Rohit out next match. He's not fit enough to play well rn, and Kishan has been playing really well while opening. He's an opener, not a run accumulator. Tiwary does a decent job in the middle order. Stick to the winning combination.",1
MI had a nice opening partnership going between De Kock and Kishan but they all of sudden decided to play Rohit before the crunch games. Rohit should've rested because fielding in these grounds is asking for an injury.,2
"We are not winning anything because Iyer is the most incompetent captain I have seen in a while.  Then I saw Kohli who is probably even worse.

So it‚Äôs going to be these two in the finals. Good for SRH to get a win here even though it‚Äôs a depleted Mumbai bowling attack.",2
Binga kkr spy with that alert.,3
Not long ago I‚Äôd have been SRH all the way here but they binned off Jonny Bairstow so I‚Äôve now thrown all my weight behind Captain Morgan at KKR and would like SRH to fall very quickly here,5
Lord Kulkarni starts off with a wide.,2
8.3 economy rip,2
The Wide Ball Kulkarni starts with a wide,1
Kulkarni's action reminds me a bit of Stuart Clark,3
"just joined in, Bumrah is benched today? :(",2
Saha is the only anchor for SRH. He needs to play until the 10 th over,2
Mumbai win this if SRH maintain this run rate,1
"Dhawal can be a good name for Indian Bartender.

Marathi: Ae cocktail nit Dhawal ani magach de",5
damn rahane can bowl too,23
Hope Kulkarni doesn‚Äôt do a first match Ferguson on us,4
Kulkarni is a very dangerous powerplay bowler. I don't think SRH can take him lightly.,4
"What a dumb poll

Why not just straight up ask whos gonna win..?",4
"Cone on DK-Dhawal

Do it for KKR",4
pls no anchor warner,3
"SRH CANT fuck this up


Can they...",4
Kulkarni and Rahane somewhat look alike,5
"Many an international star has flattered to deceive in the IPL (looking at you, Maxwell). But Warner is a bonafide IPL legend. His contribution towards making the IPL what it is, is at par with Rohit and Virat.",8
Either SRH cruise or they choke this target. There's no inbetween.,5
[deleted],1
rahane bowling well,2
"someone tell kulkarni net session are over,this is a real match.",2
No dew today,1
So Bairstow is out of SRH XI?,1
"Koolkarni is just one step below the likes of Unadkat, Kaul, Umesh and Dinda.",1
ah shit 1/5 of this innings is gonna be filled with rahane jokes isnt it?,8
Mark my words.... Srh will chase this 8.2 overs..... Fastest century from manish pandey,1
Rohit should also bowl an over today.,3
Fuck. How many Rahane look a likes are there,5
Yorkers are a good option but if that's the olny thing you've got at the death then it's a problem,3
Goodbye r/cricket : ),4
‡§§‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§Ç‡§¨‡§à ‡§Ü‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∏ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ü‡§§‡§Ø!?,3
Already feeling jittery,3
Considering Bangar's talk about dew all over the last week makes me feel like he is going to write a PhD thesis on it.,7
I'm scared of our ability to choke.,5
[deleted],16
KKR released NCN for having an hyphen in his name. Don't think he'd want to do them any favours tonight,3
"Why does rr take mi's rejects. Kulkarni, gopal, gowtham, buttler, uthappa, rahane?",9
Can we get dew please.,5
Kulkarni has a really Stuart Clark like action,7
My heart is slipping into my ass with every ball.,9
"Last time we rested a bowler, it came back to bite us really hard. 

Let‚Äôs see if that happens to Mumbai lol.",1
Polly's knock has given us something to defend,4
Tiwary guarding the boundary is just cruel lmao,5
"Back when they played for RR I could never differentiate b/w Rahane, Kulkarni and Unadkat",8
"Just as long, as you stand, stand by MI.

\- KKR",5
"Will Rahane's brother Dhawal win it for Mumbai today ? :P

Alright, have cracked this joke like 5 times already",6
"Rahane to Boult & Bumrah:

Ye main kar leta hu, aap Dream11 pe team bana lo",8
Lol Tiwary in the boundary?,3
Im scared,5
"Love whenever Tiwary has to run, not in a bad way, warms my heart",7
I hate to say this but this is SRH's game to lose.,3
[deleted],9
Cricket Australia is busy making clones of Steve Smith. Meanwhile big brain BCCI is making clones of Rahane.,5

Bangar bossing the dugout,2
It‚Äôs a crime to place Tiwary at third man,5
"Goodbye mates, have a great playoofs (intentional)",1
Sanjay Bangar blowing away his colleagues with simple Science,3
Are Lee and Styris actually stupid or are they just pretending to be impressed by 2nd grade science,4
I'm so dumb that all this while I thought you guys were talking about Dinesh Karthik,7
"Bangar bullshits so much in the dugout lmao.

Everyone just makes fun of him.",1
"Dread from it, run from it, Rahane is everywhere.",6
It is said that there are around 7 people who look like you in this world. Rahane found 2 of them in this league itself lol.,11
NCN n Pattinson Two ex KKR shud do it for KKR,5
"Wake me up when Kulkarni finishes his 4 overs, can't bear these lame Rahane lookalike jokes.",7
Tiwary is the only obese cricketer I've seen thus fat,7
Sanjay bangar needs to visit r/iamverysmart,4
Watch us lose this lmao,6
Incidentally Rohit Started his IPL career with an Hyderabad team (Deccan Chargers).,4

This has got to be the funniest comment thread throughout IPL.,4
Everyone being jealous of Australia that they have a smith cloner. But India has a more high tech rahane cloner. That can do everything.,8
NCN giving off Bollywood actor vibes for some reason,5
Kohli has a tattoo quota and Rohit has a fatso quota,9
Wait who are the other Rahane lookalikes?,2
Scenes of mi drop Rohit next game,1
Where can I see the highlights with dugout com?,3
Coulter Nile hasn't conceded a boundary yet?,5

I think there'll be a classic SRH collapse today,11
"Imagine having Dhawal Kulkarni, Unadkat and Rahane in the same team. [Insert the spiderman meme here]

Oh wait.. RR 2019.",50
Sahaaaaa :'D,2
Saha killing the hope of other Sahas,24
Gonna miss kkr bros,13
Saha wtf,5
The relationship between KKR and MI is a proper abusive relationship. KKR gifts them 4 points every single season and still has to beg MI to do them a favour for once.,70
Saha train has started.,5
Ncn justifying the Jaggu Dada look,3
"Ball not coming on the bat, difficult chase.",6
"Honestly, that Ishan Kishan dude looks good opening. So, I am glad Rohit Sharma is back in the team.",14

Apparently Saha is going to score big but KKR are going to win again. Obligatory 2014,3
Kulkarni Sarkaar should bowl his 4 overs right now.,5
Rohit is a great player but I hope he keeps his fitness up or his performance will also decline. You're injury prone if you're not fully fit.,5
Why aint NCN performing even after just being released by RCB last season?,13
Lord Kulkarni is missing his trick. Bowl a half tracker.,4
Saha is a traitor smh,6
"Saha at his best > Pant at his worst ?????

You guys are geniuses!",28
Saha has the personality of a sidekick but acts like protagonist,7
"dhawal means white or fair 

&#x200B;

ahem",1
RR really needed Kulkarni this year,5
Nile is shit. MI missed a trick by not taking this seriously. They will lose momentum going into the playoffs and potentially lose both chances and not make it to the final. I predict DC vs SRH final.  The only thing is MI is not a meme team and has usually not lost 2 playoff matches recently when they have made it to the finals.,6
"Rahane didn't use a mirror when at RR, he just looked at Dhawal and adjusted",15
Kulkarni gonna hit a hattrick isnt he,4
It is so nice to be able to get lost in the world of cricket with so much shit going on outside.,8
And that doesn't obstruct the field. Fairplay mate.,-1
Kulkarni looks similar to 70% of Indian Men under 35 years of age,24
Ashley:  This is not test batting!,5
"Who is this commentator who keeps saying "" Bohot aala this... bohot aala that""?",7
Wtf man. You take out Bumrah so you expect Kulkarni to bowl you pies and he bowls like this. Just Ambani script writing things.,19
Rahane making NCN look like unadkat,15
Guys please keep the Kulkarni jokes coming,9
"Rahane lookalike academy:

This game is gonna go down to the last over.,5
Kulkarni can get into any 11 this IPL and he's warming the bench in mi smh,11
Saha looking more like Warner than Warner,6

We haven‚Äôt had two losses in a row in this tournament yet so I hope that stays the case with the next match.,5
Maybe rohit can captain india in LOIS after koach retires. That's the only way as of now. Stop talking about it now.,8
Its either them getting us home or pandey ji coming and playing 11(32) masterclass and taking his former team to the playoffs,5
Two wickets and it's inevitable collapse but alas no Bumrah or Boult to get wickets,5
[deleted],10
MI fans are not Downvoting..this are KKR and CSK fansüôÑ,6
only a good bowling side can somehow beat MI.. No way you can outbat them..,5
No jinxing today boys please,5
"Our best bowlers are yet to come

Krunal and Polly",3
"Last year CSK had all the dads playing, this year MI has all the dad bods playing. And both coming up on top lol",4
Why does Krunal act like he‚Äôs a player who has achieved everything there is to achieve,56
Absolutely need pandey to walk in and put the brakes on,7
"Rohit is already a legend and don't have to worry much about his spot, but youngsters like Shaw and Pant letting it go in the lockdown when there is huge competition for spots in national team is criminal. Reason enough to drop them irrespective of form.",12
"warner struggling with fitness, not easy to play and run hard",7
Why is virat kholi called koach ?,1
[deleted],8
MI has a shocking lack of bench strength but unlike some of the other teams the top 11 is OP.,-2
"KKR bois , time to give up support and start doing  charity , this team ain't good for our soul .",10
I like the word statpadding,8
Mi bowling attack without bumrah is toothless,2
Wait for KKR's agent pandey to come in,7
This just shows MI is like any other team without Bumrah,7
Are they batting on the same pitch?,2
[removed],60
"This thread is on top of Reddit-Stream, I think that's where the downvotes are coming from.",15
Saurabh Tiwary makes Chawla look like he has PEAK fitness,11
"10-15 more runs in any of our defeats and I wouldn't have to watch this miserable match while our playoff hopes die a slow death

Fuck it all",4
Aw man SRH gonna break RCB hearts one more time again now.,6
Good over. I hope the run rate decrease from here üò¨,6
Can't believe they took single in 30 yards circle with ball going straight to fielder,6
God rajasthan are bottom in both the tables,7
"Where is rohits apratim captaincy?

Now imagine if  this MI played the rest of the tournament,will this team be number 1?

Remove bumrah and pandya and MI is just another rcb 
Remove rohit and you still have a strong team",4
Mumbai haven‚Äôt even bowled one the greatest pie chuckers in Krunal Pandya yet.,1
"So Win or Loss, Rohit is going to play all the remaining IPL matches unless he again gets injured. It would be an interesting week not only for IPL but also for Indian cricket team.",9
why we goin so fastttttt,5
Polly and krunal are probably gonna get them out while they try to be ultra aggressive against them,2
"If MI dont knock them out, RCB is not going to win. Never was going to win against this SRH",1
What are KKR fans feeling now?,8
I would really enjoy if MI doesn't win after losing today,6
"If SRH win today, they would have beaten DC, RCB, MI and they again have to beat these teams to win the tournament",28
Tbh RCB played better the other day against SRH in Sharjah lolll,9
KXIP and RR winning would‚Äôve been pointless anyway. One could argue they had a shot at overtaking RCBs nrr,3
It's funny that the Mutual funds ads have all the star cricketers like Rohit and Sachin.. whereas the RBI ads have Ankit Rajpoot and Deepak Hooda..,16
"Good, keep taking singles. Saha is better rotator of strike than Manish Anna",6
There would be something poetic about SRH chasing this down in 17.3 overs. Poor KKR.,23
"Considering how unlucky we have been, I am supporting SRH today.",7
Seriously i would love a dead rubber close match than a must win one sided shite.,8
"RRR 6.5 for SRH

Oooh there is a Chance",6
"Barring that KXIP game(superover), MI have shat the bed whenever Bumrah had an off day.",5
Sunny G said in innings break that there isn't any dew today lol,2
Definitely not missing those Sharjasthan Royals jokes.,10
If only that kxip collapse didn't happen,10
"Okay, so SRH had to beat DC, RCB and MI to get to play-offs. Now they gotta do that once again to lift the trophy.",29
"Murali, stop repeating what your colleague said less than thirty seconds ago.",12
Bhai 1 wicket to lelo chutiyon,6
"MI had to decide which team they wanna play in finals. Tough looking SRH or meme teams like RCB(lol), DC or KKR. Benches it's best bowlers and a all-rounder lol.",12
"Saurabh tiwary is in the team to make Rohit look fit, just like kedhar is to make Dhoni look like strike batsman",58
Really feel for Aditya Tare. He gave MI one of their best wins in 2014 but hasnt played a game since 2018 I think.,7
*Goti muh mein agaya*,7
It seems like international players perform better in big matches consistently compared to domestic ones,3
Chance pe Dance marle!,3
"Everyone out here claiming that MI/KKR/RCB fans are downvoting when it's been a stupid bot since day one of the IPL lmao. Every single comment is insta downvoted, it's not even that hard to observe",7
Jay Shah is really beneficial to Indian cricket. Ganguly already getting these Adani ads.,4
Morgan play the eliminator for us..,3
SRH gonna sweep through playoffs don't @me,7
"Damn, Tiwary can jump",21
"What a revelation Saha has been... 

Better than Jhonny with both Bat and gloves",32
Everyone had written off SRH and confirmed KXIP for the playoffs. Look at us now.,48
Holy shit that shot was pureeee class,8
"Now, this is getting too far. Holy fuck, Ben Stokes.",11
Not wasting deliveries is a single observation. Made by two commentators. Thrice. In a matter of a minute.,5
Saha has replaced Bairstow perfectly so far man. I‚Äôm impressed,7
"Such a good shot, not a bad ball at all. Taking risks.welldone Saha",4
Come on MI finish it in the 13th. Clearly no one wants to play,8
Cruel cricket from Saha.. Saurabh tivari's knees would have hurt...,13
Is Saha a better T20 batsman than Finch? How tf is he doing this? ü§î,8
I am not gonna laugh at Tiwary. lol,8
"With all that parental pressure, Chintu from Whitehatjr is gonna go bald quicker than Prithwi Shaw..",18
Saha playing almost as fast as Pollard,3
Man i love it when krunal gets smashed idk why,24
Man these shots keeping my heart beat flatter than earth,3
No.. Boost will not make you stronger. It will make you sugary. There is difference. This VK advert is not helping in spreading this message!,3
Team in blue struggling against team in red....not the ideal scenario for November 3rd,5
Remember when people thought Saurabh Tiwary would be the next big finisher for India after the 2010 IPL XD,10
Man Saha is really something. Great stuff. Keep going.,5
dafaq saha,3
Saha has been a revelation,7
Why is SRH treating MI like it‚Äôs RR today,8
"Woahhh, was Saha always this good? I've always seen him as test batsman/keeper.",3
All of you guys saying Saha has been a revelation. No he hasn‚Äôt. He was amazing for us in 2018 too when we didn‚Äôt have Bairstow.,10
"Saha : sky,pant,samsom,iyer,shaw who ?",22
Saha been on fire lately daaamn,5
The irony if MI lost the final to us because of resting players and letting us sneak in,28
"Just when you require MI to domianate, they play like this!",9
Damn Krunal is Tall.,6
"With how strong the Mumbai bench is, you would think they would find a better batsman and fielder than tiwary",16
Guys why did we give our pitch nanobots over to SRH?,5
WTF happened to saha? I still feel its a fluke and he'll shit the bed in playoffs,6
"My all time xi

Rohit Sharma

Jesse ryder

Saurab tiwari

Shimron thiccmeyer

Inzi aloo

Ranatuga

Pollard

Cornwall

Chawla

Powar

Dwyane leverock


Thoughts?",10
I think most SRH fans will fail NNN today,8
Run a ball will do it now. No silly shots pliss,3
Kill me,6
I know Ambani is rich. Hopefully he isn't stupid to retain NCN.,9
"It's the year 2053, it is the Disney+Hotstar+Apple+Google+Tesla+Patanjali IPL, the bowler is coming up to bowl, he bowls the Batsmen Sweeps Commentators- Innovative, New Age, Street Smart",10
Saha 1 - Pant 0,1
Wtf is that Polycab ad,2
Saha please keep your form for the aus tour kbyethx,5
Saha redefining T20 batting,14
Boys are playing sensibly today,9
Pollard needs to come,2
"Run rate 6 now, please play like a test match now or atleast ODI",7
Now SRH require run a ball,10
Saha is the classic example of why you shouldn't judge the book by its cover.,12
Does Graeme Swann realize he doesn't have to be funny **ALL** the  time?,10
When a KKR supporter wanted Bengali players in his team I said SRH would be glad to give Saha for free. Now I totally regret saying that.,5
This is basically ensuring Mumbai is always electing to chase in the playoffs if they were not already.,7
"Mi gonna get thumped by SRH by 10 wickets

N Shaw gonna destroy the shit outta rested 2 n shaky bowling line up",0
Srh gonna steamroll rcb in the next match unless Kohli makes an aggressive 100 or something,1
[removed],8
So this is what MI bowling looks like without Boult and Bumrah,9
"NCN : 8 crores

Bumrah: 7 crores

I will never understand IPL auctions.",19
Has Saha really improved drastically or was i just turning a blind eye to him!,6
Saha and Holder who didn't play most of the season turned out to be the main reason for SRH's turnaround. I wonder if KXiP would've made it if they had dropped maxi sooner.,9
"Saha, holder, pattinson, sky and pandey..man that's half a KKR but none playing for their former team, indeed money talks..",6
LOL KKR missing out on NRR yet again ahahahahaha,8
Inb4 Saha gets selected in India t20 team over Pant,6
"This match makes you realise that Jasprit Bumrah has been MI's most important player.

He makes this 'good team' a 'champion team'.",21
"AB and Virat after knowing they need to face Rashid again

*chuckles, we are in danger*",17
"*SRK gets into some skirmish with Wankhede security guard.*

MI : And I took it personally.",45
Moving Saha to open has been the change that has completely changed this team,24
why are people bringing pant into this lol?,3
"All of us were wow what an underdog story for Punjab

SRH : Hold my underdog story",31
So NCN and Pattinson are nothing by themselves?,6
Commentators: India has so many young and talented wicket keepers. Saha: Hold both my bat and gloves.,9
Saha‚Äôs a better t20 batsman than Pant. Who would have thought,5
Saha has an IPL ton and has shown to be a quick scorer. But never has gotten an extended shot in the LOI setup. Worth a revisit?,2
"Mumbai bowling completely falls apart once put under pressure. You just need a good start.

Delhi proceeds to play free wicket Shaw to lose the initiative early in the match.",0
"A mighty team like MI, is showing this performance?",1
If only Lockie didn't bowl that horrendous over against CSK.......,5
"Looks like SRH has this in the bag and should win comfortably. RCB is gonna get recked considering that SRH is peaking now. It most likely will be a MI vs SRH final.

What are your opinions?",6
"Saw one dude claim that Saha is a useless player who is only making runs because he is playing in the powerplay. What kind if logic is that? Even if that were true, he is doing better than Bairstow, the guy many believe to be one of the best openers in the world today.",7
Also helps to have calm heads in our team. Even the fuckups don‚Äôt hurt that bad as no opponent teams troll us,2
"I'm not even sad that KKR didn't qualify , with the way SRH Is playing I want them to win the cup.",12
I hope tiwari is dropped nxt match,3
[deleted],-13
[removed],-16
Rohit is putting too much pressure onChahar here.,3
I want someone to love me the way Warner loves reverse sweep.,9
KKR fans on a suicide watch,9
Do you guys also feel the mic's used for Dugout commentary are not that great ?? A tad bit difficult to follow the discussion...,1
"Hope MI makes a comeback, like KKR did against KXIP & CSK.",7
bye bye KKR,9
Just six words. Fuck you MI >:(,5
About time rohits place in the team as a batsman is questioned. Pollard can do fine as a captain.,-5
Congrats SRH for making it to Qualifier 2.,19
Rohit Sharma is a disgrace. Hope MI get destroyed in the playoffs.,-10
"What we learn from today's match is that without bumrah, MI becomes much more ordinary.",16
No way RCB defeating this SRH unless a certain AB decides to show up,9
I would like to watch someone destroy Rashid khan as moeen ali destroyed kuldeep.,3
Mr Ipl becomes first player to score more than 500 in a season 6 times.,6
KKR won and got out of tournament but RCB lost and got in. Just shows you have to really alert in the first half of the tournament to cushion any late bumps.,7
Now no point taking unnecessary risks; just score at 7 an over and finish in 19th over,6
Why the fuck is #ThankYouRohit trending on twitter?,10
Okay time for SRH top order collapse. Anytime now,3
Was Warner making fun or someone,5
"Man Swann and Cork in Dugout need to get their own show where they just bicker about their predictions and let Lee, Lara, Styris, etc handle the actual analysis and predictions.",2
"Just curious. 

But are people finicky that the commentary be in proper Hindi/Urdu and not interspersed with English etc. or is it preferable that it be in the North Indian conversational way?",2
"Hardik is our only fast bowling all rounder who is a designated finisher and he's not bowling 
Dubey is inconsistent and Vijay is kinda slow for t20.
Are there any domestic players that match this skill set ?",2
"As much as I love YJB, it does seem that his dropping and Saha's inclusion in this squad has reinvigorated SRH to give them this late burst",13
"aight for eliminator we shud bowl chahal in first over and put 6 fielders on leg side. but with our captains record we have been bowling siraj at full pace on a slow pitch 

so congrats srh ur gg to trash us",7
"Warner struggling to score fluently tells how difficult it is to bat on this pitch, except for pollard and SKY, anyone else did not seem fluent, If you take pace of the ball, its difficult on this pitch.",-5
When it comes to Qualifying for the playoffs- Srh is like Ye MeRa ArEa HaI AuR MeRe ArEa Me EnTerEst nHi KrNa.. OkAyyy..,6
SRH peaking at the right time huh,6
Who is koach?,3
How is Tiwary so unfit and still a professional cricketer. Wow.,3
[removed],2
The commentators simping for the sponsor's Altroz is just too insufferable,4
Krunal looks EXACTLY like this emoji on iOS üë®üèæ,3
Nrr has got to 6 and our chances of losing have multiplied,8
"Considering MI record against KKR, I thought they would want them in qualifiers in case they lose their first match .

Seems not .",5
SRH fans no reverse jinxing during the eliminator please üôè,13
See you in the finals SRH,9
Just keep on giving wicket alert it will work sometime.,6
Why is SRH playing for NRR now? Take it to the 20th over you cowards.,6
Saha is such a good batsman. really underutilized in ODI's for India,2
Krunal with his stupid antics again.,2
Friendship ended with purple teletubbies now red teletubbies is my best friend,3
F FOR MY 14 KARMA LOSS,1
"Saha 44(29)  Warner 44(32)

Saha>>> Overrated Warner",-4
"Feel for KKR. Such a convincing win over RR, only to lose on NRR",5
Saha has been a re-find for SRH. These two have batted well.,5
"Rohit sharma is the best captain in the ipl because of Bumrah,malinga,money and time they invest in team management. Change my mind.",8
Peak fitness is when swanney confuses tiwary for rohit lol,10
"So it looks like it‚Äôs going to be 

SRH v RCB 

Such a Underrated Rivalry",12
[deleted],11
It's all up to Kohli and AB. Only their individual performance can save RCB.,9
MI looks exposed now. These same bowlers looked so amazing when bumrah/Boult/openers created the pressure,-5
"The only thing that KKR did was make it easy for DC and RCB. So thanks for that!

SRH were never gonna lose this match.",7
RR fans happy that they were never going to qualify even if they chased down the total,22
What happened to MI today? I know some ppl aren't playing but it still looked pretty bad,4
Congrats Srh and good luck for qualifier 2,9
"Since last couple of weeks, all teams chasing are winning.",6
Love Jonny's child like smile,11
Time for Pollard the bowler?,1
Has Saha ever played LOIs for India?,2

Atleast i don't lose my 10 Reddit coins today.,6
Good to see Jonny smiling.,10
We are losing it,5
i just love to see MI get owned lmaoo,7
Indian twitter is such a cesspool. Any random shit keeps trending. Bots in full force.,13
Shahbaz Nadeem won‚Äôt get credit today . He was the one who started the slide by getting sky and kp in same over .,18
Saha was in brilliant form in the practice matches. It was so unfair to drop him after one bad match,8
SRH PLS DON'T COLLAPSE.,7
Krunal bowling faster than Pollard.,3
people are simply tweeting #thankyourohit or is he actually retiring?,7
Has rcb ever beaten deccan chargers/sunrisers in knockouts? I have only bad memories.,4
Calm down Saha. No need for boundaries.play singles. Not waist no ball?,7
Kkr fans who sacrificed their nuts for today's match : Atleast we got NNN. Right?,1
SRH should win without losing a wicket.,3
Krunal Pandya gets away with so many bad balls. The Khaleel of spin,10
Golly Gosh indeed!,2
"So much talk about pitch being slow.
Are SRH playing really well or Mumbai bowling shit?",6
BC give no ball you dumb fucks.,3
"So rcb have to face srh

Dayum",8
why is krunal pandya a bowler?,1
"Cricket is a beautiful sport because a skinny and small guy like Saha can be just as good if not better than a buff, burly dude like Bairstow. It‚Äôs not all about your genetics like it is in a lot of other physical sports",9
Is height no ball deactivated?,5
Why are full toss no balls not given against SRH ever?,4
It's like MI forgot that SRH winning this match means they might have to face them again lol.,7
"When i see the pessimism of srh fans despite their comfortable position, all i have to ask is why so negative?",6
Rcb needs to do other teams a favor and stop srh . They are clearly peaking now .,5
Krunal doesn‚Äôt have the control over ball any spinner should have,6
ThankYou Rohit trending on Twitter üòÇ,2
"I don't know why KKR fans consider themselves more deserving than SRH.

Without their best Bowler, Bhuvi, first choice all rounder 3D and 10 man match against RCB in which Marsh was injured, SRH deserves any slice of luck if there is in this IPL.

Except for the 127 chase, the team gave its full most matches..

The true underdog story",22
Saha has played 4 matches including this one and is 4th top scorer for SRH,16
"I can totally see the rest of dugout losing it, picking up that bat and beating the shit out of swanny ...",4
This just shows the importance of Bumrah. Bumrah helps other bowlers get wickets because batsmen take risks against them. Without Bumrah that threat is just not there.,15
That's the flattest six I have ever seen,8
They were racing to 50 clearly.,4
Lmao I guess beamers are allowed against SRH,7
Kill them off now.,4
Flattest 6,7
"Jonny Bairstow in the dugout be like- ""LOL the fucker ended my IPL""",7
bromance!,2
"What a shot , clean six. What a way to get 50 and 100 partnership.

Take a bow skip. You are wonderful",4
"Imagine loosing by 10 wickets against SRH lol

Ya 2 were rested but still 3 are ur primary bowlers",5
That was a six?! Im not complaining but damn that was short!,3
big dick 50 by love machine Warner üíòüí¶,2
Krunal Pandya is a batting allrounder when his team bowls and a bowling allrounder when his team bats,11
That prediction might become true after all.,6
KKR must be hating MI real bad. The table-toppers had to put out their least competitive show today only. They don't even look like they want to fight now.,14
Rohit Sharma was an imposter,4
This is the only kind of team that MI should be allowed to play in order to make the IPL competitive.,8
"Dread it

Run from it

SRH will be in the playoffs",8
One wicket. THATS ALL I ASK,6

"If SRH win the IPL, Warner deserves a statue in Hi-tech City or Gachibowli",9
What did everyone expect after MI rested their 2 best bowlers.,7
Chahar should use one of his 54 variety ball,7
SRH making a mockery out of MI's attack in absence of Boult and Bumrah,10
Warner was gonna go for the reverse / switch hit.,4
Why srh has such great openers?,1
Warner year after year.. whatta player.. SRH lucked out like how MI got boom boom..,6
[deleted],-2
I really like Warner's batting but hate how he always bats while displaying his teeth the whole time.,3
Nice net session for both teams,3
It‚Äôs about time Williamson gets a big one. Hopefully in the playoffs.,6
RCB won when koach won the tosses.,2
Why are people trolling rohit for his fielding? He has always been a good fielder no matter how fat he is,8
Warner didn't let Saha score the half century first :(,5
Teams batting second are now consistently winning. Is that what it's come down to?,2
My SRH bois peaking at the right time. Bring it On,3
Baristow gonna murder Saha for taking his man away from him,8
Well played brother.,2

3 more for Warner to get to 500 runs this season for 6th consecutive season,9
WTF WTF WTF. MI team is looking so puny right now!,8
Seems like those who won the toss and bat second win the match in the second half of this IPL. Too much dew?,2
And Saha became Sahooo,2
without bumrah and boult MI looks like shit..,-3
MI should bubble wrap Bumrah and Boult. Take no risk for the next SRH encounter,2

Clearly MI has given up.,8
And 500 up for Warner for the season,15
"What a placement, captain leading from the front. This is what we were missing devey",11
Only way MI can troll KKR more is by making Rohit/Saurabh bowl the last over of the game,19
"All these folks hating on MI for not having a full squad..bruh MI is the first seed, it would be stupid to play Bumrah. You need him at full strength when it matters. Maybe KKR shouldn't have faltered down the stretch, they have no one but themselves to blame",8
"Swann talking shit.

I don't think a team should play a weakened version of the table topper. There should be provision for it.

Finishing the match early so they can get back to the hotel early is such a Warner thing to do,8
Warner on 501 runs this season while looking very mediocre for the most part. How impressive.,16

That tweet guy's predictions gonna come true aren't they?,9
Omg all comments appreciating SRH have comments from MI fans about them having players resting. Dude it's okay. No need to be so defensive. FFS SRH has been playing whole season with two main bowlers missing not just one match.,8
How many 50s PANT made this IPL??,2
Chubby couldn't even bother to stop the ball.,4
It'll be interesting if DC surprise MI in the qualifier 1,7
i hope MI lose as bad as this in the finals,5
Yet another season where Warner crosses 500+ runs. This is probably his worst season yet and he‚Äôs still 3rd in the leading run scorers. Class player,9
How the hell can we win against them. God not again.,12
This is the happiest I've been in a long long time,7
"Hopefully, Mumbai's shit days have just begun",15
Nothing like taking a humiliating loss into the qualifiers.,10
SRH going for highest NRR,10
How the hell is Tiwary so damn fat? He is legitimately a heavy guy for his age even if he wasn't an athlete.,7
Actually I don't mind SRH getting the 4th spot. KKR could've gotten it but eh they aren't really intimidating this season tbh.,1
SRH fans are more annoying than CSK fans. Downvote me but the facts are facts.,-9

"GG to our bowlers and fielders. They put a fantastic fight against mighty Mumbai batting. I know they tested their two key bowlers but our bowling and fielding is been fantastic. 

Hope koach and ABD doesn't wreck us in the next match.  Chahal is key against Warner and Saha. Hope we survive against him",19
Can't believe the league stage is over.,27
MI‚Äôs Johnny sins died for this,14
"Why is no one talking about the toss factor? The teams batting first here have been absolutely fucked. We saw how quality batsmen struggled, and with the dew factor coming in second innings, it gets much easier to bat too. 

I'd say the team which wins the toss and forces the bat first have a 70+% chance of winning.",23

So the team that I am supporting is cursed to get clobbered today. Looks like it's 4 more years of Trump. The world is screwed. Good one SRH. You destroyed the world.,14

So happy for warner. He really loves srh and we love him back,22
Kkr out of the tournament. Gonna miss Subhman -Sara memes.,4
"And rcb fans say mi fans are toxic. Rohit jealous of kohli, rohit doesn't care about India, rohit unfollowed kohli on insta(lmao). Wtf is wrong with people?",12

"Proof that IPL was scripted.

SRH gotta feel guilty after reverse-jinxing the hell out of the team,14
"MI DC SRH RCB

There are two impostors among us",28
"It's like a double far-q to KKR that if Delhi had chased 150 as fast as SRH just did, they'd be through on run rate...",9
"Ok I was very mad at SRH in the first innings, but after the second one, can't really be angry. Let's go SRH. FUCK UP MUMBAI IN FINALS JUST LIKE TONIGHT. YOU BETTER SRH DAMMIT.",24
Well as a rcb fan..I'm scared now.. hoping for a miracle..,9

stupid question but all that social media unfollowing by rohit is just fake right?,5
Warner with the Moustache and Hitler salute. Nazi confirmed,15
"*Hamstring 100% fine* - Rohit

Well well so much for BCCI and Kohli defense",18
Hope either of DC or RCB wins the IPL. At least have a new winner this time.,10
The greatest prank  Rohit ever pulled was making KKR fans think they had a chance of qualifying.,18
Since we already beat all the teams qualified for playoffs on trot.. just give us the cup eh?,9
SRH has won against all the teams in playoff recently. They should fancy their chances of winning the trophy,12
Rohit knows his career is ending in front of his eyes. Must be hard for him.,-14
GG KKR no hate at all :),7
"Wriddhiman Saha prolly flipped the biggest fuck off to KKR tonight , and I'm not even mad .",23
Everyone saying rohit sharma removed Indian cricketer from bio its bs...he never had that im p sure. Media blowing this up for no reason,4
"It has worked out so nicely with Rohit coming in and taking out Ishan Kishan from the top who has been very good.

Please keep that for the qualifiers because it also ensures we play Axar. Otherwise, our genius management thinks there are too many lefties in your side and we need to fuck up our XI to accommodate for that.",4
"It would have been ridiculous if MI had won w/o Hardik,Bumrah,Boult.",11
"Bruh, a toss doesn't mean a 10 wicket loss. Stop asking him about the toss.",17

"Iyer: Mumbai is strong team and blah blah.

Delusional DC fans wishing for a rematch of this in 2nd qualifier actually think they have a chance to beat MI lol. SRH will meet MI in the final.,16
Warner can still steal the Orange cap from KL. 141 runs in hopefully 3 matches.,15
VVS Laxman looks like giving a Toastmaster's speech.,14

MI beat DC. SRH beat RCB. SRH beat DC. Triple super over final and SRH win.,13
"Shout out VVS. Never forget he was the only ‚Äúicon player‚Äù who took a pay cut in the first edition of IPL, allowing the team the get stars like Gilchrist. Gave up captaincy as well. And Deccan Chargers won in the second year.

Gotta be wonderful having him in the dressing room, a great mentor",58

"Hope we face SRH again in the final.

Imagine SRH and MI fans jumping together with the IPL trophy, with ""Thank You Rohit"" written in Marathi and Telegu",43
VVS praising Warner‚Äôs captaincy and positivity so amazing. Davey is so wholesome,24
There are more Sri Lankans in the coaching camps than as players this IPL.,29
"‚ÄòHamstring is absolutely fine.‚Äô

Good. Look forward to the BCCI notice confirming his participation in the tour.",30
RCB plz win the toss in the Eliminator,10
"Even though Bumrah & Boult were out but NCN, Pattinson & Chahar combined should have picked at least 1-2 wickets.  It was their chance to rise to the occasion.",14
VVS Lexington,18
fuck full strength srh would've lit up this ipl,26
"I was half right with my assessments this season. I predicted one of Warner and YJB to be dropped around the mid season so that we can reach playoffs. I'd like to apologize to Warner for giving up on him too early. Looks like he's still got it and it was just a rough patch at the start. I'd also like to apologize to Sandeep for undermining him multiple times at the start of the season. Man has been fantastic at the front and the biggest asset with the leather alongside Rash. I'm proud to be supporting a team that has reached playoff for the 5th consecutive season. You can be flashy with your highly successful teams like MI, CSK or star studded teams like DC, RCB. For now, I'll quietly settle with the team that makes me fall in love with the game every single time I watch them.",39

Ufff my friends already started trolling me smh,19
Bcci is looking like a fool now. Doubt rohit would lie about his injury lmao,16

"Come on, VVS. Just say it. RCB sucks and the eliminator is just a formality. ‚ÄúAll teams are strong‚Äù. Lol.",25
"Since that KXIP choke, we went on to punch DC by 88 runs, spank RCB by 14.1 overs and beat MI in a crunch tie by 10 wickets.

This ain't momentum, it's fucking orbit velocity.",62
at this point RCB win will be considered an upset.,15
Honestly full strength Delhi (with Mishra and Ishant Sharma) and full strength SRH (with Bhuvi and Marsh) are very scary teams.,14
"It's crazy how SRH always finds a way to be in playoffs, last year IRRC they qualified with 12 points even when Bairstow left, even last year they were depended on our last game and even this year they had several injuries and still made it. In both 2019/2020 KKR had much better squad on paper and still in both those years SRH just took their playoffs spot.",27
David Warner is 2nd in runs tally with 529. Dhawan is 3rd with 525,16
"When is the BCCI gonna announce Rohit's comeback into the team? Surely can't leave Rohit now, right?",16
SRH were incredible and Mumbai just didn't show up.,17
MI v SRH in the finals,19
Manish Pandey woke up the entire dressing room with that slow knock. That‚Äôs how you do it!!,29
"SRH lost 7 wickets cumulatively in the last 3 games against DC, RCB and MI

Their bowlers picked up 25 wickets.",44
It's difficult when you are a Hyderabadi rcb fan. Too many srh friends and non stop trolling. I'm afraid of what's coming on 6th,26
"Do you guys think Koach is biased against Mumbai players? Dropping Rohit for the Australia squad completely, not giving a long rope to Shreyas despite a good start last cycle, dropping Dube this season, and giving a mouthful to Suryakumar Yadav.",11
Kolkata Biryani is better anyways.,-11
Holder is highly under-rated. Has taken wickets in pressure situations and won them the match with the bat against RCB. Marsh's injury was a blessing in disguise,26
"SRH has looked the closest to invincible in the last few matches. They are going to be really hard to beat.

Which makes Q1 a must win for DC if they want their final dreams alive. We can‚Äôt play Rashid anyway so we need SRH knocked out by someone else to progress in the tournament lol.",21
Srh always find its way to playoffs.,37
"Can't wait for 'eXpErTs' to brand us as underdogs and sleep on our chances at the start of the next season, despite reaching the playoff for the 5th consecutive time.",51
"Scenes if Warner (529) beats KL (670) - Most Runs

KL: Orange Cap is overrated",45
Calm down guys. Why is all this hype around SRH. Even CSK won a game by 10 wickets. Don't forget they lost 7 games and still have a non-existent lower middle over. Plus they are the original collapse kings. RCB has a good chance if they can take early wickets which they have been doing all IPL.,-26
Another season of We Find our way into playoffs,39
Doull has a lovely voice,10
The biggest upset for me would be RCB beating SRH. I really can‚Äôt see it happening.,17
Lads Warner mentioned 2016 season. Its happening,29
Rcb can do it I feel. Remember  Mi showed no intent today and  also without its big players.Go RCB !!,12
RCB will have to pick up early wickets. The way both teams play the powerplay will decide the game.,14
"We gotta face SRH now? Mom come pick me up, I‚Äôm scared",29
Man I have a gut feeling RCB‚Äôs gonna spank us hard in the eliminator,19

Virat should sledge Warner during the match as a headstart for Australia series,33
Morris and Saini both are injured right?,10
"I don‚Äôt see SRH losing to RCB. 

So either way Delhi has to beat a team they haven‚Äôt beaten to progress further. I like it. Get better or get fucked is always a good lesson in life.",28
"If Hyderabad win, will this be counted as the second title or third, considering how Deccan Chargers have been whitewashed from IPL history.",18
"IPL 'New Vegas' : 
    
top 4 teams at half stage = top 4 at the end

The game was rigged from the start.

KKR ""The Courier"" : uhhh...Dakiya dak laya",7
Mumbai's bowling really is incredibly average outside of bumrah. They're massively reliant on their batters scoring 180+ every game which they have consistently done tbf to them,10
gavaskar really really hates SRH huh. u think our speedbreaker will be RCB,39
"Honestly, I was expecting one of Bairstow or Warner to be dropped in the starting but what makes me very happy is that the team performed the same way maybe even better despite this change. I remember SRH faced a lot of criticism for breaking the Warstow partnership but they proved all the critics wrong. Special mention to Saha who made an incredible come back after everyone criticized him for his very slow 30(31). He has been amazing the past few matches and now even Warner is back to his peak form.

Before the IPL began, everyone expected SRH to end on the last place or 5th or 6th, but no one saw them as a contender for the play offs spot. Things haven't gone their way this entire season losing the swing king- Bhuvi, Vijay Shankar, who finally found form and Mitch Marsh who looked promising. Many close calls in so many matches but they came through despite all these set backs and are a force to reckon with right now.

All the teams will now be worried about SRH the most, definitely. All the best SRH!",27
"If mi had won Today we would have perfect matchups

Delhi - north

Jason Holder is the most underrated player in the world.,33

"I hope that Jason Holder bags in a juicy deal in the next mega auction, truly underrated player and he‚Äôs been an incredible addition to the SRH team. Feelsgoodman.",50
Was just catching up on the first innings and man how good was Saha with that stumping. That was very low bounce and he made no fuss and affected a clean stumping. Truly the best keeper in India atm.,55
"Why was man of the match given to Nadeem, who got Krunal's and SKY's wickets, over Sandeep, who got Rohit, Ishaan and Cock's wickets and Warner who hit 85?

See his economy and all was good, but it wasn't a match winning performance imo",32
I hate Iyer and management for destroying my confidence going into the playoffs. I feel like i am just walking into a shit show because these folks are so incompetent. Prove me wrong fuckers!,29

"Pattinson has been good but I feel Dhawal Kulkarni deserves a chance. I think it's too late for him now but I just feel a pace attack of Bumrah, Boult and Kulkarni is just as good and could make a space for Lynn. Again, it's too late but this is something they could've done with Rohit out.",5

"Wish Chris Lynn played this match :(  
He would have helped his former team.",2
"Jason Holder, an ex-KKR player, didn't play like this for us earlier. But in the SRH team, he has become a beast in bowling and batting. Talking about Bad Luck.

Another one is Nortje (part of KKR last year) pulled out due to injury, and was released. But Delhi took him in, and he became a beast there.",5
