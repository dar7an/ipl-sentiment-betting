They did exactly as said, sent in Krunal and Saurabh before 13th over because low runs. 

Granted, by winning the toss on a wicket where the ball was stopping, SRH got lucky and chose fielding, and SRH's bowling was exceptional. 

But, I was right, this is what MI does right - don't send in sloggers until after the 13th over.

I remember SRH faced a lot of criticism for breaking the Warstow partnership but they proved all the critics wrong. Special mention to Saha who made an incredible come back after everyone criticized him for his very slow 30(31). He has been amazing the past few matches and now even Warner is back to his peak form.

Before the IPL began, everyone expected SRH to end on the last place or 5th or 6th, but no one saw them as a contender for the play offs spot. Things haven't gone their way this entire season losing the swing king- Bhuvi, Vijay Shankar, who finally found form and Mitch Marsh who looked promising. Many close calls in so many matches but they came through despite all these set backs and are a force to reckon with right now.
