2020-10-26T16:44:34+00:00,Mr_Bean12,"Unpopular opinion: DRS should be cancelled. Whenever a team appeals, umpire should decide whether to review or not (similar to runout or VAR in football).


One of the criticism for this has been that it adds lot of time to the game which is already long. So this is what I propose.


The on-field umpire should then tell his area of doubt (pitching or hitting, sometimes more than one area or sometimes umpire is certain its out). 3rd umpire should then check that thing 1st (this saves a lot of unnecessary time). A lot of times, it'll be impact outside, so then no need to go through the whole 9 yards. If its impact in line, then they can check other things like edge, hitting, etc.


But care needs to be taken that umpires dont send everything upstairs like they do today with runouts.",11
