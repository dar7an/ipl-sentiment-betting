Guess what. I am first to comment again.,13
"Very important match this, if KKR win then pretty much top 4 are settled",5
[deleted],85
"Just like I said in the previous thread, will be praying for this one too. Hoping for a win on VijayaDashami :)",3
[deleted],2
"Hot take whoever wins this will win the tournament. MI, DC and RCB have all lost their last games, while KXIP have won their last 4 (I think?) and KKR's players seem to be coming into form at the right time.",9
Veer-Zaara face off,45
I am getting tensed. If kkr wins it will be better for  rcb but also kkr has one of most boring teams and doesn't deserve to qualify. Don't know whom to support !!,-1
"KKR are going to shit house their way into the final, aren't they?",2
 KXIP  winning will be good for the tournament,9
"Expecting a Gayle special tonight at Sharjah. Narine and Lockie are going to be key for KKR for stopping Gayle.

  If they bowl the likes of Prasidh or Nagarkoti to him, it's going to be a massacre like what he did to Deshpande the other day.",38
KKR has lost both of their previous Sharjah games. But fingers crossed tonight.,7
Please have Gayle open. He'd absolutely vital in the powerplay.,4
Hopefully kxip win this and make it interesting,9
"What do you guys think would be our XI for today?

I think Hooda goes out and Mayank comes in

I'd like Maxy dropped but they have 3 left handers so idk if that will happen",3
I will be very surprised if PUNJAB don‚Äôt win today and make things very interesting as things should be. Let‚Äôs goooooo script writers..,4
"Till Friday I thought we had a good chance of qualifying since we'd beat CSK and RR comfortably.

After watching the matches yesterday, now I'm not so sure.",3
"DEAD RUBBER


/s",3
"I can't recall watching Pooran bat before this IPL, but to me he's now the most exciting batsman of this IPL.  Not sure how much he was bought for, but he's worth every penny.",7
Win it Punjab so the Lord may have mercy during our next encounter.,6
Double Super Over finishing with a Mankad pls,33
"Kxip winning today will be the best for tournament as we'll get maximum drama and a nail biting finish for the battle of the fourth position

Make it happen, IPL script writers üëçüèª",30
"..I dont know but... RCB gangs should prey kxip should lose... If somehow kxip qualifies for playoff.. They can really decimate RCB to shreads... Cant see another year going down for RCB.... While RCB has pchycologic advantage over KKR.... it would be easy for RCB to win against KKR compared to KXIP. 


...fingers crossed.. üòåüòå",8
I just want a gaylestorm,8
"Oi, are you guys gonna beat these cunts to finally avenge 2014 or we gonna bend over?",24
KXIP should play Maxwell today (irrespective of whether Mayank is fit) - Yay or Nay?,3
KXIP win today unless the script writers don't want a good climax. 10/10 big brain time :D,2
"I expect KKR to demolish KXIP today, because they always turn up against us. But it's KXIP again, so can't be that sure. I'd say, KKR is winning with 60-40 chances.

^(It may, or may not be a reverse jinx.)",6
Whom should I be supporting for RR to quaify?,7
How many ways can KingsXI fuck this up?,4
"KXIP are facing off against Mumbai in the IPL final. Mumbai bat first and post massive 198 off the back of De Kock 89(56) and Pollard 45(20). 

In KXIP‚Äôs chase they lose 4 quick wickets in the powerplay of KL, Mayank, Gayle and Pooran. Maxi walks into the crease at and smokes a 6 off the first ball from Bumrah. From there he doesn‚Äôt look back and scores a massive 125(65) and wins the trophy for KXIP. 

How‚Äôs my fanfic?",115
[deleted],16
"I hope, KXIP can get more fans after this season. They have the least fans, I believe",8
Neesham should play instead of Maxwell today I guess,2
Fuck it. Give me some entertainment is all I ask.,6
I think hooda out for Mayank will be only the change. I wish Gowtham/neesh played for balance but both Jordan and mash have been excellent and unfair to drop them,6
In my mind KKR have already won this match and qualified for playoffs.,4
"KXIP v KKR always gives me hella anxiety, we absolutely shit the bed against them almost every time we play them",4
"While the fact that a full fledged IPL is happening in itself is great, it wouldn‚Äôt have been half as interesting without the theatrics of KXIP. Hands down the most entertaining team this season. Hope they somehow qualify for play offs.",10
"I just hope KKR don‚Äôt fuck this up, seems exactly the kind of match where we get out for 120 odd or lower",2
Commenting so that I can easily find the thread when the match starts.,6
Bruh. People in india are more loyal to their fav teams than to their partners. Wtf,13
"Narine has the wood on Pooran. He also is mental against spinners. Even the H2H is lopsided in KKR's favour. They always turn up against us

Lads, I don't have a good feeling about this",14
I hope Maxi can find some form here in Sharjah if he plays today and can tonk some over the short boundaries,4
"So with how everything has been going on, fully expect a quickfire 85 from Maxwell today.",8
KXIP this year is the most fearsome team there has been in IPL,5
To produce even greater drama the team that finishes that 1st gets to choose to bat/field in Qualifier 1 and the team that finishes 3rd gets to choose to bat/field in the Eliminator. No toss.,10
Even if KXIP don't make the playoffs they have consistently been the most entertaining team of the tournament. Hats off to you guys.,72
"Idc who wins, it should be high scoring thriller and a close fight for what's on stake today",3
Have the teams been finalised? KXIPs site said Maxi may be left out for Neesham,1
Andre Russell 70*(30) coming up,0
I expect no less than 2 super overs today. Either this match will go down to the wire thanks to kxip or it'll be a bore depending on kkr,3
"As a neutral for today's game and with little stake in this season, I'm loving this IPL and it's even better because the team whose name I don't want to utter and ruin this auspicious day of Vijay Dashami is out.

Hoping for a good game and good luck to both set of fans.",4
"It's KKR's game to win, if Mayank doesn't play",2
"Because this is Sharjah, I have a feeling Punjab is going to win this. KKR have been woeful on this ground. Punjab is a stronger side while chasing too. So the odds look good in Punjab's favour. KKR batsmen have to step up big time today and aim for 180 at least.",6
Mayank still not back üò≠üò≠,1
What's the ideal result for RR?,1
"Arey yaar. If kxip loses this,I will be very sad",2
Wait no mayank. Oh shit c'mon man wtf,3
Was hoping Mayank would hit em :(,4
I feel like bowling is the not the best option for some reason,5
Mayank not playing. Big relief for KKR!,5
Mayank out. Game over bois,6
[removed],3
And the Quarter Final is about to start.,24
"Please ffs, just let Gayle open today or I'm throwing another tantrum man fucking hell",9
"Wait wtf no Mayank, Gayle‚Äôs gotta open today man",3
 gayle opens or I riot,3
Both teams going with the same team!,3
Please I want to see someone getting mankaded today,6
I love seeing Punjab chase,6
Fucking hell Pooran. Mayank's injury is on you. You better hit a century today,5
KKR should win. Just for the shit show in CSK vs KKR match.,4
I wish my parents had as much faith in me as KXIP has in Maxi.,18
"Do people who support 2 or more teams in the Ipl,sluts irl?",10
"Forget Gayle opening. If DK bats on 4, we riot!",14
Punjab chasing.... This is going to be fun,7
Please Maxi hit a 50 today?,12
Gill should come at 3.,8
r/cricket vs KKR,19
"If Punjab continues with the kind of death bowling they‚Äôve had for the past few matches, they can restrict KKR to a chasable score. With the dew factor and their batting line up they should win this imo.",7
I hope Maxi plays half as good as he does in the nets today,8
"I can see why Gayle wont open, leaves our middle order too barebones",10
Maxwell hitting huge 6's in the prematch challenge,11
Jesus Maxwell hit them in the Match too,3
maxi nets mein marke Kya hoga?,2
I think batting first could be a blessing in disguise for KKR. Anything around 170-180 would be a competitive total considering their bowling attack.,1
"If kxip loses, they and rr wont be able to qualify",4
Varun narine lockie is an incredibly difficult bowling lineup. Especially with Pooran being narines fucking bunny,6
I am so glad MI lost yesterday,9
Maybe Maxwell spends all his energy winning the Glucon D award. Maybe why he barely clearly the 30 yard circle this IPL,4
Maxwell can only hit sixes in this power challenge,6
Maxi has a chance to prove he is better than stokes,2
Feels like pure shit just want Mayank back :((,3
Narine is gonna have an absolute field day. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a potential 100,1
"Baz came to me and said: ""*Open karega*""

Sunny looks like a whole ass baby between these two,6
Sangakara's accent is sexy,3
Maxi gonna pull off a 3/15 today,4
Where are you all seeing Maxi in the nets? In hotstar they are showing previous game highlights,5
Maxwell in the team because he won the 6 hitting challenge,7
"Hope Mayank Agarwal gets fit soon.. India needs him in the Australia series.. Bhuvi, ishanth, Saini, pant and now mayank.. Too many injuries to almost starters in the indian team",4
"Today I'll try not to be mad like the previous game, whatever happens we worked so hard. And stop with kkr deserve to lose. Fucking bullshit that is.",12
Maxi 17 from 21 balls incoming,5
Kxip winning matches = orgasm,5
Well i hope KKR  finish top 2 with mi and play q1 and final with MI,6
I can't fucking stand this super over quiz bs,5
KKR v/s Universe,5
KXIP should replace Maxwell with someone who shows üí•SüíñPüéáA‚ú®RüåüK‚ùá,5
I really feel Gayle should open today. Mandeep Singh is a proper floater and he can bat anywhere but I personally think his game is tailor-made for middle order. Also gayle upfront can destroy the inexperienced kkr bowling giving time for Rahul to settle.,3
[deleted],7
How do they keep finding indian women with Australian accents for the Ipl?,8
Plz be a 200+ sharjah and not a 3-4 sharjah,6
Btw does anyone know if one can watch dugout commentary on star sports instead of Hotstar?,2
If you're the boss of the Universe aren't you God? Is Gayle God?,3
Most Sixes in IPL having Gill as an option                                        Shubman Gill probably- *Why are we still here just to suffer*,5
">Narine against two leggies and an off spinner at Sharjah

This is fine",9
kkr playing 5 batsman strange,4
"Let's pull this off. If only we had Mayank, though",6
"I swear though, no one looks better than Maxi when he hits a six. Looks absolutely swashbuckling. The long swinging, the foot movement, the follow through, just amazing",5
[deleted],3
Would any team be out of the tournament from the result of this match? Like CSK was eliminated yesterday.,6
Oof no Mayank still. Maybe he is still injured. Sadness,7
"Off topic but I can't stop thinking about this.

If khaleen bhaiya cant have kids  due to weak sperms ,then who is munna bhaiya's dad?",3

10/3 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,5
Maxwell has  more wickets than ankit rajpoot and kuldeep this season,12
SHAMI YOU BEAUTY,7
HGAHAHHAHAHA WE INTO PLAYOFFS BOYS!!,6
"My expectations were low, but holy fuck",7
All going according to the script.,5
Lol Shami bhai this isn't 4th innings,10
I am having a heartattack right now,8
Wow....the bowling is pretty tight right now... love it.,8
Holy fucking shit lmaoooo. Fuck kkr. Go punjab,7
"Maxwell the Bowler >>>>>> Maxwell the Batsman

Cummins the Batsman >>>>>>> Cummins the Bowler",8
KKR is back,3
Holy shit it's happening,9
That's out,5
Fuck off. Dk is a finisher,5
Kxip you about to make your fans cry with joy today,11
Wow KKR really either do good or completely COLLAPSE,21
If DK fuckes up the review idk what to say,3
"Beautiful, thats definitely out",7
Karthin Jezzzusssss fing chorist,2
"CSK played well and turned it around yesterday. We need to play like them.

KKR top order: Say no more fam",14
49 on the cards?,5
Shit review,8
"Thanks Kartik, very cool",8
Am happy for RR,4
wtf 2nd innings Shami is on point,3
KKR and batting collapses,3
DK Bose mad or wut?,7
Csk fans having war flashbacks,9
Let's go bois,3
At what point do we start the 49 countdown?,5
DK came only to waste a review.,3
DK that‚Äôs a desperate review lmao,3
dinesh review system,1
They should have hotspot,3
"WTF DK... Not only you are out, you also took away the only available DRS. Full on revenge mode",7
Dinesh Karthik with that 3D chess move review.,4
"Lmao review wasted

I can understand tho, hit the pad at the same exact time",7
KKR this is not RCB.,4
[removed],14
Got a wicket and snared a review in the process,7
Why did he review that?,2
"Shami, you beauty!",7
YESSSSS,4
Why would you review that? That's a big nick!,6
KKR have 2 modes. 84 all out or 200,29
KKR getting treated like an amateur team as they should be,9
49 or 84?,8
"There's a deviation as well, out",7
"Damn the confidence with which he asked for review.

Lmao",11
Someone end this misery for KKR lmao,6
Waste of a review,3
"Gotta love the hypocrisy of r/cricket. When Punjab was loosing Kl, despite being their highest run getter is blamed. But when they are winning, no one praises kL and his capitancy lmao",9
DK probably thought his bat hit his pad,6
Bat hitting the pad?,4
Hotspot would have been handy,7
Lol what a greedy cunt,6
"Yeah, we are done. Goodnight.

Congratulations to KXIP.",7
Shami is god,8
"Shami In Test mode already with these Caught Behinds, Punjab going to win this year",10
Karthik is free wicket,10
Damn DK and DRS gone but useless,5
Why don't they understand Karthik is a finisher now,7
So how do we know he didn‚Äôt hit his pad? I‚Äôm a bit confused,11
You love to see it.,6
Wtf was Karthik on? KKR is on suicide mission.,7
RCB fans checking in right now smelling the scoreline,12
Ah shit here we go again!!,6
LETTTTS GOOO,4
why didn't this kolkata play us,7
"**1.6** Mohammed Shami to Karthik, OUT,  **10-3**

KD Karthik c &dagger;Rahul b Mohammed Shami 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",4
Ego>team spirit,4
At this point the top 3 teams would seriously want to qualify at the top 2 positions not to get 2 chances but to rather avoid the wrath of Punjab in the eliminator.,13
Just tuned in and wtf.....,2
These two wickets have reminded me of second innings Shami.,7
Lol dk. Never learns . How many people need to tell him he is not a regular batsman . He is only fit enough to bat 10-15 balls and go for it every ball at the end .,8
Arsh vs Morgan,5
GO ON KXIP I‚ÄôM ROOTING FOR YOU SWEETIE,6
[deleted],0
I want to apologize to DK for thinking he would never do something as stupid as this,4
"How do you review that. Hell, how do you not know if you hit the ball bruh. Even if your bat touched your pad.",3
49- all out flashback for the second time in 2 weeks,7
How did this team score against DC?,3
Review waste,1
I feel better about SRH‚Äôs garbage chase now.,8
"Masters of death collapse : SRH

Masters of powerplay collapse : KKR",7
"DK is gonna get benched at this rate. The only thing keeping him on the lineup was his captaincy before, but now idk. Either bench him, or make him play at 6/7 as a FINISHER, which he‚Äôs actually good at",8
Klown Knight Riders,5
So last match was a fluke?,4
Morgan coming in after a collapse...again,7
"Get fucked KKR. Sending Karthik up the order, not learning anything from the previous games.",10
"I am just baffled how KKR are on 12 points.

They have been as bad as csk this season honestly",7
Karthik has been piss poor there and averages a single digit whenever he comes in at 4/5. Such brain dead decisions from KKR management lol,9
Should have hotspot. That sound could be bat to pad sound.,4
To be honest KKR plays like associates nation.,3
We just have to collapse at Sharjah don't we.,2
"Kings doing Preity well here, Khan the KKR pull this together from here?",15
KXIP making this IPL spicey.,6
At least Slow Gill is not out ...,3
How the fuck is KKR on the 4th spot is beyond me.,7
"Cmon 2nd rcb bros, we failed, you get em below 49",3
Dk will finally have his wish filled when srk throws him out and csk welcomes him with open arms..,12
"Bhai log, yeh match to shuru hone se pehle hi khatam hone ko hai!!!",1
Come on Cap,3
KKR repeating its last innings,2
"@KKR fans, all of this started because of the bone headed decision of opening with Rana and fucking up the whole upper middle order",2
KKR management really messing up with DK man,4
Shami has been on fire this season. Has only messed up during the death overs and even that aspect has improved massively,9
"I thought DK 'gave up' the captaincy to focus more on his batting. Well, 0(2) isn't doing a lot more for him.",6
"For the last time, don't send Karthik at no. 4. He is a finisher, not a no. 4
He is lacking confidence too badly",6
"We come so close to the lowest score, but somehow manage to get past it everytime! Hope that's the case today as well.",11
RIP KKR,1
I went for one minute and missed it,1
Shami bowling that test length,2
DK left captaincy for this,9
Gill SR watch: 117,2
Karthik might have hit his pad at the same time as the ball.,4
Script writers are back this week.,2
[deleted],5
Best move KL can make now is bowl Shami out. He is in such great rhythm.,5
I‚Äôm mad they decided to fire off against DC,5
"Football score

You've got a football score

A very unlikely one, but a football score nonetheless",5
"**300+ T20 matches by Indian player**

Karthik took Chakravarty's medicine,3
"I'm terrified of VC , Lockie and Pat Cummins",6
'khushi ke ansu' from panjab fans,5
"Koi na Arsh, koi na. Good shape.",3
On the other hand you have Kohli who walked despite not edging the ball in a World Cup game.,6
"Ultra Edge is kinda flawed because it can't differentiate whether or not the impact is the ball edging the bat or the bat clipping the pad. That's where HotSpot helps. I understand it's super expensive, but this way there's no way of having a proper system in place.",8
This is the time for gills tuk tuk,2
what chutiyappa is this.. keep bowling maxwell m8,2
Morgan's probably wondering when he started playing test cricket for England again with all these collapses,8
Now watch KKR still go at 10 RR after those wickets,7
"Everything is falling into place. If they go on to lift the title now, it would surely be made into a movie",9
KKR are the real Brohit/Nohit,2
"Last match wasnt even a fluke, Iyer fucked up so bad that he let Narine face Deshpande Stoinis Ashwin instead of attacking with Rabada and Nortje.",2
Lowest score of 49 :  *I'm in danger*,3
Karthik has totally changed his technique he's only a finsher now that also not a power one,3
Just tuned in.. Go KXIP!!,1
Is this a do or die match for either of the teams?,2
"Oh wait, i know this one - KKR guys play the same way against any Karnataka Team?!!!",5
This might give KXIP the enormous NRR boost lol,5
Shami right now is better than Bumrah with his speed and accuracy.,13
Morgan will lead the recovery,4
Kkr being RR,3
Karthik is a good finisher but KKR is intent on finishing his career.,10
"Did shami get a buff or something, dude's been hitting different ever since the super over",7
"Damn if they play like that, now gills 100 strike rate does seems too bad

As a great KL once said ‚Äústrike rates are overrated‚Äù",8
It might have been bat on pad. Unfortunately not much umpire or DK could have done.,5
"Okay, as a KKR fan, I concede. We don't deserve to be in the playoffs",10
Why would they not want to open with Narine?,8
"To quote a great philosopher - ""It doesn't matter which team wins, I am here for entertainment""",12
"KKR and poor powerplay, a never ending love story",3
KKR need Gill to anchor the innings which is ironic since their fans don't like him tuk tuking,7
Preity makes me feel things,3

"This sub once had a thread of apology to dk, lol",15
No way we are gonna win this,4
"KKR management need a long hard stare at themselves.

"Let's be real, this is Brendon McCullum's team, not the captain's",10
We would benefit so much from a Live Thread,7
Morgan to the rescue again. I wonder what he's really thinking behind that ice cool exterior. His brain is probably smacking itself against the inside of his skull watching his team bat,11
Foreigners must be cracking up looking at a name like Arshdeep,16
McCullum has turned KKR into Duggal sahab. You just can't predict what you are going to get. Proper meme material.,5
To 49 or not to 49???,4
Fuck this shit . Same as last year . Had our faith in our hands only to bottle it hard,6
"As the tournament progresses, Paddikal's claim to emerging player is slightly decreasing and Arsh/Bishnoi 's is improving",41

KKR's bowling has been masking what a shit show this batting order has been throughout the tournament,5
"Morgan should have taken responsibility and come in at 4.

I swear to God if Morgan stabilises the innings and denies us the collapse like he did against RCB I'm gonna start a petition to make Sam Billings England's white ball captain,5
Buzdil kaptaan - shoaib on Morgan probably,3
1)Is Karthick the biggest dumbo that can't even understand if it's edge or not after playing for decades. 2) The bat hit the pads. Apply Occam's Razor.,2
Gill has that piece of cloth strung like how some Indian women of yore used to have a small pouch for carrying supari,4
Eoin Morgan has very red elbows,3
49/10 incoming?,2
What the heck? Leaves?,1
Sharjah took offence at all the SIXES RUNFEST BAD comments,4
Scenes if they go on to win the title and we see a limited series like The Last Dance,2
Great opportunity for Gill to give tests audition,4
To be honest we don't deserve to enter play-offs. Even CSK seems better at this point.,9
Good shape again!,2
CA bats are sexy ngl,3
"There are three types of team in this IPL

FIRST - DC RCB and MI

SECOND - CSK KXIP RR and SRH

Then KKR playing their own type of game that no one understands",25

"Morgan once again sitting there thinking ""why am out in the powerplay again? Im going back to England.""",10
Punjab deserves to be in playoffs. Some matches they've lost were extremely close and their team has been strong.,5
wtf Bishnoi is FAST RUNNER,4
At least get 140-150 so the bowlers have something to defend. Fcken dogshit batting team!,4
Btw that was Maxwell's 100th T20 wicket,10
And we picked Rum Sastri over Kumble,6
What the fresh hell is this? Lmao,4
KKR : Always in the middle of table. Always stands at a point where it can make or break the tournament. And always sacrifices itself like a lamb to make the tournament exciting. ALWAYS....,7
It's not fair to Morgan..most of time he has to bat in these stupid as hell situations created by top 3..,12
DK hates Bengalis... either side of the border,11
"If kkr don‚Äôt make it to playoffs this year we can fully expect to see dk in some other team next year . He has played in so many ipl teams - mumbai , Delhi 2 different seasons , Punjab, rcb , gujarat lions , kkr. Only team he has left is csk and srh",8

Isn't the par score here 200?.. so KXIP would be happy with anything under 180?,5
Fun fact : #KXIP has best bowling economy of 8.7 at death in second half of the IPL,5
Irrespective of what happens to KXIP this season. They've a lot of positives to take from and have a good core of 6-7 players to build a team around. Beautiful,10
"Btw Gill is here from Mohali, Punjab. His house is literally next to mine, his parents are good humble ppl and their society puts on the match on a big screen or projector whenever he‚Äôs playing",36
McGrath would have been proud of that bowling.,9
Never supported KXIP in any season. But this season seems so different for them. Their matches are firecrackers.,10
Shami is one of those few bowlers who actually increased his pace at a late age. When he first started he was somewhat of a trundler but can now regularly cross 140.,11
"Why is McCullum sending DK to build the innings again and again. He failed in that role, but he was excellent as a finisher. Why is the management destroying his natural position!!?!!",13
Gill SR watch: 82,5
Shami hasn't played a single playoff game in his IPL career yet?,3
Crr is still close to 6. Just keep maintaining that for a couple of overs but kkr need to play the spinners well,2
Get Shami that hair transplant! Deserves it,14
"Looks like fans of RR, SRH and KXIP all want KXIP to beat KKR today.",8
"Every time I see that DK replay I'm convinced he didn't hit it and the ball swung after it went past the bat, in the way that Shami gets it to do because of his seam position.",4
Can we please have an AMA with the IPL scriptwriters?,13
"If Punjab wins today, giving 1st over to Maxy will become a superstition rather than a valid strategy.",17
I feel like Shami has taken more important wickets than Rabada but I could be wrong,8
I am excited for the battle between Murugan and Morgan.,9
"KKR need to realize that Rana is their most consistent batsman and they need to stop fucking with his batting position. Should've stuck with Tripathi to open, why did they change it?",13

Guys stop it with the 49 shit... ffs,12

I want this Shami for the Australian tour,21
Goddamn the sound of the bat on that shot was insane,10

Morgan I love you but get out,10
How the fuck is KKR in top 4.,13
Why are pakistani players banned in the ipl? We could really use shaheen afridi,6
Is it hard being a KKR fan ?,10
"So, since a lot of you guys don't know, Ravi Ashwin did a YT interview with Murugan Ashwin and said the team calls him Mash to differentiate between the 2 ashwins. So no, I did not come up with that nickname",18
"So glad to see Morgan finally having a great IPL, his batting has been world class the last 2-3 years. Definitely an underrated batsmen",6
Morgan pls don‚Äôt,9
How is Morgan against off spinners?,6
Inb4 murugan to morgan,8
I have never seen this packed offside field,10
Watching KKR destroy DK's confidence by sending him in a position which clearly doesn't suit him over and over again is making me angry.,14
SRH have definitely been shit but we‚Äôve lost two relatively close games because of outstanding catches by the other team. Lost the KKR game because of two boundary relay catches and lost the KXIP game because of Suchith‚Äôs catch on the boundary.,6
Morgan don‚Äôt do this :|,5
KKR prepared for KXIP's batting by playing 6 bowlers and 5 batsmen. KXIP's bowling came out of syllabus.,9
Why aren't they using hotspot despite all the boatload of money?,7
Captain Morgan should get some inspiration from fellow Stokes' innings,4
Having a live thread would be so much better imo.,4
Trade dk to RR,2
I've a feeling that Kkr still gonna make this. These two guys will get a partnership built.,1

KKR & Sharjah's relationship is toxic.,23
Morgan is playing with fire here. Feels like he will get out anytime but looks like he's also riding his luck here. A hundred from Morgan after the one from Stokes yesterday?,12
Arshdeep bowling is Live example of Vector multiplication in Action,10
"If punjab go on to win this IPL, it would be the greatest comeback story of IPL ever. Even better than Mumbai's 2013 or 2015 run.",57
DK apologists in this thread are funny. While quitting captaincy he said he wanted to focus on batting. Chances are he might even have asked for no.4 slot himself. Also after YEARS of experience this excuse that oh the poor chap is not batting at his favorite position just doesnt work.,14
Cameraman should wear his glasses,11
Very good camera work,12
Is Gayle a lucky charm for KXIP? They've been on fire since his inclusion in the team.,9
"Lol what was that, couldn‚Äôt even see where the ball went",12
Ah we're back to the shitty cameraman.,8
The camera work is so bad today.,6

/r/praisethecameraman ....NOT!,7
"Sending DK so early in an innings to like setting him up to fail! He is a finisher.

Sending him at the 2nd over to build an innings is never gonna work. Did not work in the WC semi-final. Did not work in earlier matches in this IPL. Will not work in future as well!

You can not ask a civil engineer to build a computer and say: ""engineer hi to hai, kaise bhi to kar lega"".

KL Rahul is already sad lol.,10

"Eoin ""fuck this shit, this team is dogshit, ill just do this myself"" morgan!",28
Well played Murgenjee,5
"Best of Morgan!!

Finally in IPL.",7
Just tuned in now and boy boy oh why am I not surprised?,4
Sanjay Bangar: ‚ÄúEwen Morgan‚Äù,12
"If you want to build a shit team, just pick players /cricket memes the most - Maxwell, DK, etc.",4
"Today's match:

r/cricket vs KKR",11
Someone forgot to send Eoin the script :(,8
Gorgeous six.,6
"Yo gill ,be cool for now you can catch up or maybe not",4
Bruh these 2 gonna win this match,2
We expected you to Play possession game. you started counter attacking. WTF KKR,10
"Yes or no. 

Does Eoin Morgan still being in the Big 4?",0
These boys are in the mood üî•üî•,6
"God even if hypothetically Eoin was unsuccessful in getting England the world cup the extension of this philosophy that he got from Baz and NZ is so good for world cricket. There's such a clarity of purpose in his aggression, and I know England won the WC because they are quality from 1-11 in ODIs but it's one of those times that the philosophy of the cricket is personified in the captain.",8
I N T E N T from these two,5
 Gillman üëç,5
Despite the wickets this is probably the most intent we've shown in the powerplay lol,7
Okay this is gonna be a high scoring match,6
Eoin ‚ÄúI will just do it myself‚Äù Morgan,1
WTF was that six. Pure timing,9
Morgan's captains' knock on the way,4
Hope KXIP don‚Äôt get complacent in the field. KKR recovered well from a similar situation in their last match,9
What a tiny ground. We've kinda lost most of the advantage we made in the first 4 overs,4
Need. Wicket. NOW,3
Sharjah is back.,3
What a recovery by these two after those 3 quick wickets,5
My eyes are pleased,4
RIP guys see y‚Äôall next season,4
Is kkr finally following English template,9
This is what Gill is hyped for.,1
Stand and deliver from Gill,3
Looks like sharjah is back to being a road,10
KL fucked up sending Shami. Very costly over.,4
That was so crisp,5
So the demons in the field are gone? It's a fucking road now.,6
Completely fucked with KL's plan to dominate with Shami's 3rd over.,11
My God that is scary hitting,7
Am I dreaming?? This is some legendary counter-attack!!,10
"Interestingly, all 7 teams want KKR to lose tonight and KXIP to win. The last time it happened, it was IPL 2014 Finals.",37
"if these two can go unbeaten, KKR is still on track for a 180 score",8
Bruh Gill went from 0->100 in 2 balls,6
"Shit , Gill got the r/Cricket memo it seems",9
"Wow, Class written all over that shot. Wow Gill Wow !!!",12
r/cricket in shambles,3
If Gill can do this imagine what Gayle will do,7
"KL, change your plans now. Get the leg spinning option going",4
"Someone on Cricbuzz: 

>KKR and CSK not doing good in this IPL. 

Yeah they're both the same, one is knocked out and sitting last on the table, and the other is 4th on the table and still has a very good chance of making it to the play-offs. Cricbuzz needs a muppet filter.",15
How have kkr made 54 in PP after that start wtf.,12
how the fuck did RCB make 49 all out.,5
Morgan looks like he's in great touch,3
Gilthunder is hitting!,5
Nice counter attack from these 2,3
bangar please stop. please,6
I smell a gayle Daddy hundred,6
49 ruined,7
Oof 21 off the over,3
Morgan might as well open.,4
Shami got whacked for 21 runs in this over oh man,6
So today's the day he has decided to be aggressive smh,5
Bangar going with the stereotypes,5
KXIP probably regretting taking those wickets too early,4
My god . MY GOD. To attack a bowler who's swinging the ball and has picked up two wickets. üëèüëè,10
lmao what a shitshow by Shami.. literally gets cunted every ball.. still keeps bowling on the same length.. go for yorkers you fukwit,3
Real Gill has arrived.,5
"Time for the spinners, maybe another Maxi tukka wicket?",5
Sanjay Bangar saying Rashogullah üòÇüòÇüòÇ,7
Gill is hitting so that his strike rate is above 100 when he gets out,6
"No matter how well these two bat I'll be scared for the next 10 overs at least, another wicket and we run out of our batsmen pair",4
"Gill is only playing these shots during powerplay, he's too safe to take these chances after it.",3
Reporting emergency at the Sachin's!,9
"What the fuck!

Chad Gill....",4
"oh great, weve gifted form to gill",5
This is gonna be a sick game,9
Sanjay trying to speak Bengali: ROsHAguLa,6
Bangar stereotyping as hell with his rosogulla comments,6
"It's impossible for any team ever to get all out at 49, just shows how much pain rcb fans have faced for so long",14
Gill looks great. Hope he does it more in national colours,6
Shubman Gill now averages 178 against KXIP,5
my god is Bangar cringe,5
"Holy fuck Gill, that is the ideal shot from EA07 with even the ideal slider right in the middle of the ideal meter",3
KKR fans in the powerplay: They had us in the first half ngl.,2
"This is good cricket. Bowlers not doing much wrong, but amazing counter attack by two classy players. Now its up to KXIP to respond courageously.",7
"lol, Shami somehow fucked it up after that great first over.",12
LOVING THE INTENT,2
It was fun while it lasted ‚Äîa  Kxip fan.,5
"Me when I see girls : Blah who cares 

Me when I see Morgan: Why you make me hard !!!",7
KKR will definitely retain Gill. Great talent.,2
I don‚Äôt see DK coming back next year for KKR unless he turns it around massively. He is old and miserably out of form. He doesn‚Äôt bat well up top when he needs to anchor. He doesn‚Äôt finish innings. All he does is get out cheap no matter the situation against all sorts of oppositions.,4
"When is a six not a six?

When it's an unacademy ""cracking"" six",9
Bangar please never speak bengali again lmfao,11
"Raool .. Bowl Shami for 3rd over , one more wicket , more pressure , attacking captaincy. 

Morgan and Gill: Lol.. JK",8
Bangar with the fake pretend Bengali Punjabi is definitely avoidable.,7
Big gun Morgan,5
That wasn't a bad over from Shami. He only bowled 1 real bad ball. It was just Sharjah things.,6
Good fightback!,3
Daddy Morgan showing intent‚Ñ¢,2
Sharjah is back bois!,8
"No one: 
Bangar: Mishti khabe",2
Man do I hate this ground,2
If Morgan stays thro then 200+ for sure,5
I feel like KKR enabled their champion instincts since last match. Counter attack amidst early wickets.,2
"Bengali person: *exists*

Sanjay Bangar: kemon achen, mishti doi, roshogolla",9
This has been a great counterattack to the sadness of KXIP. Nothing in the pitch after 3 overs.,2
Stupid sending DK before Morgan,3
"If those guys had not gotten out, they would have scored lesser than this",10
"Even though im happy seeing Gill hit, maybe showing intent at this point of the game when you already lost 3 wickets might not be such a good idea. Just chill out and let Morgan take charge of the big shots. Most of the time Gill has gotten out this season is because he tried to show intent. But hey, if you feel like you are connecting with the ball well today, by all means, go right ahead and get the runs. God knows we need them.",1
"KL pls put your leggies now, no more fillers.",6
KKR's approach to this innings looks like bazz's way of playing cricket.,7
"Some people used to doubt Morgan, he is only thing consistent about KKR batting line-up this season.

Gill is pumped.

I hope those guys have stopped fighting for ball.",10
This match is fucking intense! My God aren't we in for a thriller,5
wow we have a respectable powerplay score!,10
We did it boys. 49 stays with RCB. Go get 150 more please now!,4
Gill SR watch: 156,10
Might as well stop playing inside the stadium and move to batting on the highway adjacent. This is a fucking road now!,8
Stupid chutiya running in road,8
Now you know how shitty that RCB 49 record really is.,12
Making the early wickets look like nothing,5
"I like this partnership , they are usually sensible and don't do stupid things randomly",6
Bangar on technical stuff is superb. Leave the tomfoolery to Swann bruv.,5
KKR should just start at 0/3 from now on,53
"Seems like the underdog is KKR today inspite of them being 4th rank.

Rooting for a 190+ score today by them.",10
Kolkata trying to win by boundary count,21

Seems like Sharjah is back to its high scoring ways,11

"Amazing counter attacking play from these two batsmen. Well, maybe this comes naturally to both of the guys it seems !",11
welp,4
Bro imagine being a captain and seeing your strike bowlers getting destroyed like this,9
Mistimed jump....could have been stopped atleast,3
Morgan: Look.. I'm Narine now,4
What a shit ground,3
"Who knew that after those 3-wickets collapse, we would still put up a great powerplay score.",13
I bet Bangar is the type of relative who asks you what your salary is in the middle of a party.,4
"Come on KKR, if you really want to be the meme team get an unnecessary runout",4
Damn. 50 partnership up already,7

Bangar cringe af ..,1
"KXIP needs to show faith in two leggies. Don‚Äôt be scared by the ground size or the fact that there is a lefty.

"Aight bois, someone get Morgan and Gill outta here before they bring up Run Rate to 10",2
"Maxwell treated like he should be

We respected the shit Outta him ffs",3
The last thing I want today is Narine's 60,2
"I guess KKR realized there is no point playing 20 overs if you are going to score 84 only. It is better to hit out and score the same in 10 overs.

However, with no proper batsman after them, this so called ""intent"" can last only for so long, without costing us a wicket.

This would have worked if we had 7 people who can bat! We will lose today, but at least with some dignity. Not like sheeps against RCB.",3
Arshdeep could have caught that if he was right on the boundary.. he was going backwards trying to catch that and wasn't even next to the boundary.,2
Varun and Narine gon put some pressure on us das fa sure.,0
I think my society has a bigger ground than Sharjah. Everything is a 6 here. LMAO.,9
"That wasn't a six in any other ground. But not going into your shell after 3 wickets fell and attacking back, is so admirable. KayKayAaa üëå",5
Gayle will be ineffective today. Narine will get him. Or Lockie. Or Cummins,6
If Gill can strike at 150 the par score for this pitch is probably 220.,7
"If the Sharjah pitch is back and stays same for 2nd innings, with dew factor coming in. KXIP lineup looks dangerous.",6
"I think this fake crowd cheers business has gone too far when the DJ screams ""Make some noise !!"" at the nonexistent crowd and then hits a button or something to make the loud cheering noise...",12
Morgan making sure that Maxwell doesn't sneak in a performance to hide his dismal IPL season^again,7
"Kkr batting insanely well after their ""collapse""",5
Kkr: Gegenpressing,2
"MI put up 195 yesterday. Stokes stepped up, finally.

Whatever KKR puts up, maybe it's Maxwell's turn today.",2
I am in a dilemma. I want Gill to succeed but not at the expense of KXIP.,3
Baz making converting the whole team into him,5
I'm jealous. My team would tuk tuk it's way to death over collapse if we lost early wickets. Maybe KKR deserves the No.4 spot.,7

"**8 single-digit scores in an IPL season (top-5 batting positions)**

Gautam Gambhir 2014

Rohit Sharma 2017

Shane Watson 2019

Also their teams in those occasions have reached finals with 2014, 2017 winning the IPL & in 2019 coming in finals",12
Murugan is the only antidote for Morgan,1
I usually love Dugout. If only I could somehow mute Bangar üôÑ,2
I have a feeling Mandeep singh is gonna cunt KKR today,1
"Its been a great season guys, loved the last 4 games, we atleast went out fighting, more than i can ask for",5
Bangar should remain behind the scenes relaying his observations to the better non-cringey broadcasters.,2
I think I celebrated too hard after those three wickets. God was like ‚Äúthis bitch ain‚Äôt having fun two days in a row! not on my watch!‚Äù,7
Remember when the timeout used to be 10 whole minutes?,-2
Sucith would have caught that smh. He mistimed the jump,2
"Morgan based his captaincy off of Baz, theres really no surprise that the gameplan was to counterattack hard when youve got both of them at the helm",6
"We still got Jordan, Bish and Ashwin to introduce fwiw",6
This is the Morgan brand of cricket we know . They play in this aggresive style even when they lose early wickets.,13
First ball wicket after time out?,1
Is bishnoi playing today?,1
This is why you have Morgan in your side. He simply injects life into an innings regardless of the situation. Brilliant counter-attack. Also reminding us that Sharjah is smaller than a postage stamp.,21
KKR just have 2 more technically part time batsmen. And then tail.,10
are these two the last legit batsman that KKR have?,5
Captain Morgan has a track history of turning things around. Remember England‚Äôs 2019 WC campaign? They were stuttering during the middle phase and almost got out but turned things around. Can KKR do that?,5
Spinners gonna get tonked here aren‚Äôt they?,1
now Morgan will unleash his big dick SIXES,4
Charl looks like that white man prop guest for Desi weddings.,6
Morgan sweeps incoming. I hope he doesn't get out doing that shit.,5

Can commentators say nice things about Morgan or Gill.. their Jinxing works 9/10 times.,8
"Omg! Langeveldt has aged a bit

The OG knuckle ball bowler",6

"Legendary counter-attack though. Win or loose, kkr has my respect from not playing tuk tuk cricket under the circumstances they were in",9
Anyone going under 8 rpo here has done their job lmao what a shit ground,1
Why doesn't ICC have fixed boundary lengths? Even in England they reduced the boundary length in the same ground where the first 2 matches were played with a bigger boundary,5
I have been a CSK fan for 3 years and can't believe that they scored 125 on this ground.,4
Pretty cool to see Gill back in form but I'm really worried about Gayle storm üôÉ,2

Gill and Morgan taking revenge for the first couple of overs.,3
Cmon I tuned in because KKR were losing what is this I want my money back,3
"Smh, Gill showing intent from start to finish. Sigh :(",2
Suddenly even 200 seems like a shit score,5
Gayle will need to open. With Mayank out now there's a even stronger case for that.,3

Ever since their collapse against RCB they have done well to counter attack after losing quick wickets in PP.",5

mfs be running into the street to catch the ball..,8
"Love this from these 2, if you're gonna go down go down fighting. No point putting on a below par total and probably losing again for NRR in this situation",5
Wicket looks good. Or are KKR batting very well? Or are punjab bowling horribly? Can't figure.,5
Will they keep hitting sixes even after I start watching it on hotstar?,9

Wait that side head bob is actually an Indian thing? It's not just some kind of satire?,3
Akash Chopra is pretty self aware,2
"It is statistically proven that tonight, one in three cars is going drive over a screaming speedbreaker",7
It's such a weird novelty watching England internationals playing against each other. I don't watch county stuff so it's really interesting to see. Don't really know who to root for.,20
"This is the smallest ground. This reduces quality of cricket and is unfair.

There should be questions raised if Rahul does his usual run a  ball innings again today.,5

Jordan finally found his form aswell.,5

Woah what an over üî•,3
"Cool over, Jordan",1
Can Maxwell actually score runs today? Kings XI probably would have won the games they've lost if he contributed with his batting.,3
Tight over from Jordan.... *Noice*,6
Maxwell should just stop batting and focus on his bowling if he fails to break his six jinx even today.,2

I don't feel confident chasing more than 150 without Mayank.,3

Narine should actually wait for the spinners to come. He can play out Jordan and Shami,5

Omg a 4 from a short ball,2
That's so Gill type shot,3
"McCullum: Strike First, Strike Hard, No Mercy",4

Nagarkoti gonna do a tewatia to Fuck r/cricket as usual,7
I think the decision to send Nagarkoti ahead is the fact that Cummins could be vulnerable to spin and they can't afford to lose him before the death overs of pacers where he could hit the ball out of the ground,7

MASH what a fucking googly,5
Thank You Sanjay,6
What the hell why was he even sent out,6
Mash underrated,6
Sanjay Bangar's on fire with the wicket alerts this match,9
"""And you ask why I play slow""

         - Gill",9
Big gun Murugan!!,2
"Being a KKR fan, I‚Äôm happy to see Nagarkoti getting bowled out",3
Isn't chakravarty a better batsman than koti and others,2
Bruh Nagarkoti I feel you :(,6
"Ashwin needs to be in the national team, when we're playing at home at least. Look at that amount of spin!",7
"**14.2** Ashwin to Nagarkoti, OUT,  **113-6**

KL Nagarkoti  b Ashwin 6 (13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 46.15",4
Cummins or Ferg?,1
Zinta gets more footage than the bowler who has taken the wicket. She is cute though. :P,10
Bangar the predictor,2
BHENCHOD THEY DROPPED PANT,6
Come back like KXIP,6
Scenes if Cummins is getting out first ball duck,4
Murugan has the most spin to the ball in this tournament,6
Those 6 run from 14 balls really could be vital,5
"Yeah, sure. give three overs and one wicket for free. Great job, KKR.",2
"""I would go to war with Nagarkoti on my side""

-Dhoni",13
Is it true that Rohit will miss the entire Aus tour..?? Varun Chakravarthy is in the T20 squad!!,6
"Man, Preity Zinta is drop dead gorgeous. Current generation of actresses do not compare",25
"Alexa play ""Dhundho Dhundho re sajna"" please",7
"Wicket isn't bad at all , KKR have played utter shit shots",3
Kkr probably wanted to avoid Cummins playing spinners,7
"MI, DC, RCB sweating profusely",2
Sanjay Banger has lightened up so much now being in the company of Swanny.,6
Sanjay might be Bhangaar but he is doing good job with his predictions thus far,3
Squad list post kardo,4
 Night watchkoti experiment failed poorly,0
Nagarkutti [üò†](https://emojipedia.org/angry-face/),4
I wonder what chakraborty will do on this pitch,2
Do wicket keepers wear box guards ?,2
Varun Chakrabarti selected for Australia tour,7
Murugan Idli FTW!,4
Samson ahead of Pant in the t20I squad this sub gonna riot,5
"damn it, spoiled the wicket maiden",9
Kumble will be proud of his spinners,8
Give Bishnoi the next over and finish Cum,3
Thats what we needed. Keep him on strike.,3
Finally Pant can play without that responsibility nonsense,6
Pant dropped?,6

*ESPNcricinfo*",6
Bowlers doing good keeping Gill offstrike,1
Damn cummins why did you have to do my boy ashwin like that.. he was about to get a wicket maiden,2
"He predicts a Wicket this over

A wicket that over

It‚Äôs Sanjay Bangar

He doesn‚Äôt go wrong",2
That could've been a maiden 15th over. Lmao!,2
"Cum, cum all over the stadium now. Time to shine.",5
One run and a wicket. M Ash is a boss today after being tonked by morgan for those two sixes in his first over. Great mettle shown here,2
M. Ashwin's googley turns a lot.,4
"Remember the weekend, yes the last weekend, when we were all so excited at the prospects of this match. This match. What a let down !",3
"India's T20I squad for Australia: ""Team India T20I squad: Virat Kohli (Captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (vice-captain and wicket-keeper), Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Sanju Samson (wicket-keeper), Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd. Shami, Navdeep Saini, Deepak Chahar, Varun Chakravarthy""",19
"KL's captaincy has been brilliant this game so far, keeping the pressure up with field and bowling changes.üôåüèæ",2
No Brohit? What?,6
"Gill was going great today ,this is totally on the rest of the top 4",7
Varun Chackravarthy in for the Ind vs Aus T20s,4
Pant dropped from Limited overs team. Good call. KL in test squad. Brilliant selection. Overall happy with the squad. Not sure about Siraj in test squad. Chahar better swing bowler. Also Saha in test squad. Means rishab might be second choice.,5
"Wait, was Ind vs Aus squad announced?",6
"Full Test squad: Virat Kohli (Capt), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar, Ajinkya(vc), Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, Saha (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Bumrah, Mohd. Shami, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, R. Ashwin, Mohd. Siraj",11
Looks like thala has been teaching masterclass on tuk tuk batting to all the old timers,9
Where is squad released? I see nothing on cricbuzz and cricinfo,6
So Rohit going to miss ipl as well as Aus tour?,2
Seems like brohit out of ipl and Aussie tour.,2
Have no hopes for india in australia tour. They simply cant win this time,2
"Didn't need to give Maxi his 2nd over.

Bishnoi won't let it reach 20 overs",5
So does this mean Rohit won't play any of the remaining matches for MI?,2
Kkr is gonna lose we dont hv a chance their batting line up is very good,1
Why are Warne and Murali bowling like they want to enforce a follow-on,4
"Why the fuck is Thakur still in ODI squad, man literally lost us like 4 games",3
"If 90% of your deliveries are googly as a leg spinner, are you considered a leg spinner or an off spinner?",6
No Rohit?,3
Thanks selectors. Pant will fuck shit up now,6

"Varun chakravarthy actually made the indian t20 squad, im so proud of him. To know he had a normal office job just a year ago, crazy!",11
"Deepak chahar , siraj and Chakraborty in T20 squad for aus",2
"Where you guys seeing the Ind vs Aus squad? I can't see it on dugout, it is on normal commentary?",9
Rohit is pretty ordinary in T20 so good call to be honest.,4
[deleted],5
"3rd umpires voice is as if he was woken  up from sleep to watch this replay

Edit: spelling",10
BISH I LOVE U,1
Clearly bat hitting the pad is getting recorded on snicko... DK could have just hit his pad :(,4
KKR innings almost at a full stop after Morgan.,7
Bishnoi does it again!,5
1 off 8 bruh save it for India,3
Discussion when there‚Äôs no review?,5
lo maa oo,4
Murugan and Bishnoi great job lads!,4
Fuck we are going to see Shaw in Australia. He‚Äôs a walking wicket right now,16
So that's why P.Cummins was not sent ahead of Nagarkoti.,4
Suddenly this thread has became a IndvsAus discussion thread.,15
Where‚Äôs the Indian squad?,1
KKR gonna finish what they started in the RCB match,6
"Thank you for not selecting Pant. That should fire him up. If not, he is finished.",3
The match is over.,3
Brohit should really focus on his fitness.,6
Is the squad announced for aus tour ? Link please,3
Lmao what were they even discussing. Dk already used up the review,10
Missing leg again,7
lmao DK used up the review... bye bye cummins,8
"Bad call, shame Dk wasted a review",6
Rahane in test squad. Prob his last chance,5
There wasn't any review left what are they saying,3
Only a Telugu umpire can say Decision just like that... (disshon),4
What a shit decision,7
"That was clearly identical to last time, and not out",11
This pitch is clutch af,2
"I'm 90% sure that was going down leg

If only Karthik hadn't burnt the review",12
They don't have a review Corky,2
"**15.4** Ravi Bishnoi to Cummins, OUT, this is a straighter wrong'un, and he gets his man. Cummins wants to review, but they don't have a review left. This googly starts just outside off, and it is closer than the last one, but it is still headed down leg **114-7**

PJ Cummins lbw b Ravi Bishnoi 1 (8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12.50",3
There's a separate thread for the squad news guys,8
Cummins should invite Vijay to the next team dinner to take revenge on Karthick for that review,7
One of the greatest comebacks incoming,4
"Great, so now we get to face an angry and determined Rishabh Pant tomorrow...",11
Ravi Motherfucking Bishnoi you absolute beauty. fuck yeah,10
That's going miles down leg by looks of it,4
So Rohit isn't playing IPL again?,1
Nagarkoti had a better strike rate than Jeera,3
Gill staring at the collapse at the other end lol,9
So no surprise why KKR sent Nagarkoti ahead of Cummins. At least he was making some contact against spinners.,5
DK also ate the reviewüò°,7
"It's turning so much,no way it was hitting",6
"So basically if u want to play for India, just play for rcb.",29
KL Rahul named vice-captain and keeper in ODIs / T20s for Australia tour.,23
Where are you guys getting the India squad updates?,6
SHIT UMPIRING,4
"This innings is like a 13 year old boy nutting before the video even loads.

100: 10.5 overs

114/7: 15.5 overs

14 runs in 30 balls thanks to twin Jadhavs",9
"Ik not match related but damn preity zinta is pretty.
Also kxip making a comeback, mi and dc have lost a couple of matches.",4
Bad fucking luck,3
Dinesh Karthik,14
DK fucked Kolkata lol,12
Stats show Bishnoi got 65% of wickets thru googlies. That is impressive control,7
"2 collapses in the same inning

Korbo Lorbo Collapso",9
"How the hell is Kuldeep in ODI squad, he doesn‚Äôt even get picked by KKR. He has been found out",10
Jeez that was missing,11
[deleted],9
Oh noooo......,5
Damn dk,6
Yeah Karthik really fucked the review,6
Silent wicket maiden,7
Omg that cute Punjabi girl will be the end of me,7
HAHAHAH FUCKED UP DK,9
"Definitely not out, shame they don't have a review that was a poor call",7
Damn Cummins is utterly clueless against leg spin,9
[removed],1
"Woah Varun Chakravarthy in T20, Md. Siraj in Test squad for Australia, unfortunately no SKY!",5
Jadeja inclusion in all 3 formats. Who woulda thunk?!,-2
DK hell bent on foookin KKR,9
Rohit not in any squad for Aus??,3
Wicket maiden over ruined again.,5
Last two overs 2 runs... LOL,13
Teams want to make top 2 so that they don‚Äôt have to face Punjab in eliminator,8
Damn DK effed it up for Cummins too,8
Samson over pant in t20. *grabs popcorn*,20
"No Rohit in t20 squad? He hasn't been performing in good t20 form, so it's fair. But it's still a surprise to not have Rohit in your white ball team. Hope this lights a fire under his ass.",2
Kxip peaking at prefect time,6
[removed],7
Not very worried about Rohit missing the tour. Need to start looking for Rohit and Shikhar replacement. This might be a good start. Give the replacements a long run.,4
That Nagarkotti promotion was almost as bad as Tewatia promotion (before that 30 run over).,6
Ball is not turning square. It‚Äôs turning pentagon.,2
"Thanks DK , Probably saved 20-30 runs there",15
what were KKR thinking? They only played with 5 genuine batsmen and none of the 5 is really rock solid.,8
"13/2 off the last 5 overs, amazing, well done boys",7
How many players can be retained by team in the mega auction next year?,2
Can a mod pin a comment diverting Indian squad comments to the Indian squad thread?,6
Is it because of Rohit's fitness?,2
Dk doing everything he can to get dropped,5
It's all fun and games until Gambler Ganguly shows up at your local bar.,6
"Gill is just stat padding now, no intent after Morgan wicket",5
"At least folks would now understand why i was mad after DC‚Äôs comprehensive loss to KKR.

DC really need to get their shit together or they can even miss the playoffs.",7
Only scary thing is how much its turning.. does any KKR bowler spin as much as the KXIP leggies?,3
"Who can spin the ball for KKR other than Narine and Varun

Looks like a very spinner friendly track",3
1 run in the last two overs lol,13
WTF is he reverse sweeping,3
"I see Cricinfo releasing T20 squad, but is India even scheduled to play T20I in Australia?",2
[deleted],7
The umpires take free money and are retards. Every decision should be reviewed.,11
So full on intent is not the best approach. Morgan should have considered the depth of his batting line up when deciding to counter attack after losing wickets.,3
"Cummins and Maxi are playing only and only because their franchises paid a high amount. (Just hypothetically) if they had paid less, they'd been dropped by now.",11
KKR just postponed their powerplay collapse,6
VVS Gill. It's time to farm the strike ffs!!!,6
KKR were at 10 RR at the 8th over. 6.97 now,6
Rohit dropped from ODI squad.?,3
"Samson in place of Pant in T20 and ODI squads. I am high, so somebody confirm this for me",8
Chakravorthy is a good spinner but I think Bishnoi is better,9
[deleted],5
"Also as a tamil nadu ranji fan, excited for Chakravarthy and Natarajan to go get good experience in the Australia tour and bring it back for the ranji season.",3
Ferguson again to KKR's rescue,3
"Hmm, has Rohit opted out of the tour?",2
This will be an interesting chase with ball spinning so much,4
What a clusterfuck of an innings this is.,7
Where are you guys finding the squad news,3
Who bowls the remaining overs guys? I‚Äôd bowl out Jordan and Shami,6
Can someone tell me how many reviews do each team get every match?,3
3 long paragraphs on the umpire by Bongs incoming,3
Kxip spinners get way less credit than they deserve,7
Lockie's black boots >>>,2
Atleast we are not CSK with proper batsmen tuk tuking.,8
KKR still gonna get to 170 with Gill in,7
"Wait, so they had Ferguson *yet* they sent in Nagarkoti AND Cummins before him?! Do these idiots there not know about NZ ODI cricket team?!

Why isn't their management fired by now?",9
Bishnoi hands down. Even though Chakravarthy got a fifer.,6
"Guys, Test squad for Aus series has been declared",3
You can check the squads for the teams on BCCI Twitter handle.,7
sky was 10 times more deserving of the t20 spot than samson. i hope samson justifies the selection if he gets a chance,6
Tbh openers are not that adept to playing with the tail. Not their natural game.,3
"This innings:

10/3 (2)

81/0 (7.5)

33/4 (7.1)",11
Galaxy level brains of r/cricket blaming DK for the lost review and not the umpire for a brain dead decision,9
[deleted],2
"Narine & Varun can definitely trouble KXIP batsmen. All they need is, early wickets of KL and Gayle.",8
Why is Rahul VC over Iyer?,9
"They were easily looking @180-190 one time, now they'll be lucky to even get to 160.",5
People discussing the team selection with a bit of panic reminded me of when people used to scramble for 10th/12th results.,8
Oi Gill you have done enough to silence the critics. Please get out now,7
Clarification: they said they were monitoring Rohits progress,3
Ok Ferguson isn't even half as good with the bat as Cummins but let's not speak as though that 1 (8) was going to get us to 160. Was Gill's responsibility to keep the pace instead of giving Nagarkoti 8 dots,7
"KKR there is one imposter among us

DK : Is it me?üëÄ",5
Will Rohit still be playing upcoming IPL games if he‚Äôs ruled out from the Aus tour due to injury?,2
"Ferguson has the batting ability to partner Shubhman, so 160 is still very gettable if Subhman manages till the twentieth .",4
"I realized something. Gill play is simply mirroring his partner. If his partner plays well, he plays well. Otherwise he goes into a limbo",11
So 2 from Jordan and 1 from Shami,2
Where the fuck is Rishabh Pant,5
Why is manish pandey still in the squad?,1
"jimmy neesham posted a really cute vid of lockie ferguson with jimmy‚Äôs dog earlier today, I can‚Äôt even get mad at him",4
Dugout Gurus going on and on about that LBW needing to be referred and not realizing KKR used up their review about an hour ago.,6
Selectors are smoking crack.,5
Why no SKY in T20 squad?,3
Remembering Jordan‚Äôs 25 run over ü•¥,2
So Rohit's out of IPL too? Well there goes our chances down the drain.,3
Went to wash my plate after dinner and Boom! KKR is 7 down,5
Would have liked to see ravi bishnoi tbvh,2
"Ah,so they were shielding Lockie, I see.",3
disappointing that t natarajan wasn't picked,6
Will Rohit Sharma not be able to participate in rest of IPL???,5
And they sent Nagarkoti in. Fuck this team,4
ferguson you goddamn beauty,3
"KXIP: They had us in first half, ngl",7
Gill has gills. That explains why he is the only one surviving after the entire KKR team drowned :),5
I would have kept bowling the spinners till the 20th over. Pace might suit the batsman better,2
So ferguson can bat too,9
It‚Äôs such an asset to have bowlers who can bat a little. I‚Äôm not talking about allrounders. Having a bowler who could bat might have helped SRH in the last game.,6
O come on jordan.... You can do better than that,1
Ferguson should come earlier,1
Very happy to learn that KL has been named as the VC for both ODIs and T20s,8
[deleted],-20
Lockie and Cummins fighting for a spot incase Russel comes.,9
Ferguson has jersey number 69,5
Okay next game we will send Ferguson in place of Narine,1
Even Lockie's batting has been more consistent than these shit top order KKR batsmen,3
Old Jordan is back,1
More like Lockie Four-guson,11
"Damn, locki is smashing em",3
Fergs already the third highest KKR scorer lmao,9
Lova ya CJ but I‚Äôve got a tenner on KKR so please keep throwing pies,3
Ferguson is to KKR what Archer is to RR,8
Lockie actually seems a decent bat,6
What is a good score today? Is 160 good enough for today‚Äôs Sharjah?,3
"Team India T20I squad:¬†Virat Kohli (Captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (vice-captain and wicket-keeper), Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Sanju Samson (wicket-keeper), Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd. Shami, Navdeep Saini, Deepak Chahar, Varun Chakravarthy


They dropped my vadapav",8
This match forgot to take its bipolar medication,6
Lord Jordan giveth.....,4
"Ishant sharma is likely for the Adelaide test, according to Espncricinfo",3
Makes the Nagarkoti promotion so much more wierder. The matchups have fucked their common sense,4
Will Keeping for 50 overs affect KL's batting? Dropping Pant was a bit harsh imo,2
Why isn't Rohit Sharma included in the squad for the series down under?,2
That's out,5
"Just realised, no ashwin for the limited overs side?",7
Guys I am pissed. We have Manish fuckin Pandey in our T20 squad to tour down under.,11
Meanwhile KL Rahul named as vicecaptain for India squad,10
ferguson is lockie underrated as a batsman,9
So KL's getting a second chance at an Australian series. Hope he makes the best of it,8
That's out lol so he won't give it,9
That looked close,5
Wait they picked Chakravarthy based on his 5 for last match or has he been a good bowler the whole IPL?,8
No reviews left. That looks interesting first viewing.,6
Lmao that looked plumb,8
KKRs batting order looks absolute BANGER on paper but somehow they fail to perform most of the time,12
Why don't IPL have 2 reviews given that ICC have added an extra in each format,2
"I do not get why folks consider rising from the ashes more impressive than absolute annihilation. Yeah it takes mental strength and all that crap but in the later case, you are just that good.

I would rather be just that good to win all 16 IPL games.",0
That was dead as dodo. Fuck IPL umpires,2
the Indian batsmen have been mediocre at best for KKR this season,8
"We should have 2 drs reviews per team in IPL .

If we can waste time on strategic time out then we definitely have time to let teams use 2 drs reviews",7
Kuldeep Yadav gets drop from all the formats?!!üòî,6
"Bishnoi deserved to be in the T20i squad, not Chakravarthy !",8
Why is there no Lord Tewatia in India T20 team?,1
How high the selectors have to be to even remember pandey name let alone select him,2
Need to get 35 from the next 2 somehow,2
[deleted],1
"Chintu: Mom I want to buy Archer 

Mom: But we have Archer at home

Home: Archer at home is Jordan",5
so rishabh pant is a test specialist now?,4
guys stop asking about rohit sharma for australia tour. BCCI have mentioned specifically in the last line of their statement that they are monitoring rohit and ishant sharma's health.,13
What has KL Rahul done (after being dropped) to be picked in the Test squad again?,7
Why are we discussing India squads in the IPL match thread. SMH.,3
"What is the ""crowd"" chanting? I swear it sounds like ""Take it off!"" lol.",5
"Mohammed Siraj was talking about how he wants to play for India in the Tests and it looks like he's in the squad, good for him, I hope he does well",4
"limiting reviews at 1 as opposed to 2/3 silly, especially considering umpires go upstairs for the most obvious run outs, so it‚Äôs really not a time thing. Wasting 2 extra minutes is worth it when the integrity of the game is at stake",4
Hahaha Samson is in Pant out. r/cricket will have a meltdown.,14
"Fuck Ajinkya is vc, they aren‚Äôt going to drop him in tests, we are fucked",0
Sqaud announced for Australia series... No Rohit Sharma in any of the squad... Varun Chakravarty gets up his maiden India call..,6
Varun chakravarty making it to indian team within 3 years of turning pro?,13
Chakravarty hasn't been that impressive to be selected to play for india. Maybe as a backup to Sundar?,2
I think KKR is not winning tonight unless we see Ferguson magic tonight. KL and Gayle are in amazing form it is difficult to pull this off,7
Manish Pandey is the Indian equivalent of Glen Maxwell... utterly inconsistent in IPL and comes good for India.. not surprised to see him in the T20 squad vs Aus.,5
Can someone link me the dates of Aus India T20I fixtures? I find test and ODI but nothing on T20I,1
Surya Kumar still doesn't get a chance. At the very least in t20s he should get a call up.,7
SKY misses out again!!,2
Gill denying a single?,3
Pant getting dropped for Samson has completely ruined my mood. I need a KXIP win more than ever.,14
I think Kohli has beef with Pant,3
"Please just give me a GayleStorm‚Ñ¢, it's been too long",5
stop declining singlesüò°,6
So happy unironically that Pant is not selected which kinda makes him more dangerous for Delhi,5
What the hell does SKY have to do to get a call up,5
Considering that there would be qurantine restrictions. The teams have selected along with backups.,2
Should have taken the single there mate.,9
KL Rahul would have more success if he batted like he was playing in a T20 when batting for India in test matches lmao,1
No....,1
"‚ÄúNo, Lockie! I want to get out on the next ball‚Äù",12
Lol denying the single to get out the next ball,8
We have already lost it no chance of winning,4
Natarajan is ‚Äútravelling with the team‚Äù. Is that technically being part of the team?,5
Surya Kumar cannot be selected because it messes up Mumbai auction retention for uncapped players.,5
Ferguson was just fine just get that run you don't have many Gill,2
Gill denies single and then gets out...,7
[deleted],13
Chahal and Chakravarthy would be danger on big grounds of Aus,4
"Shubman, kya bhai. What are you thinking",3
We are gonna finish 7th aren't we ?,5
150-160 should be fairly easily chaseable on this pitch,2
Seriously? I can't believe people asking if rohit fucking Sharma is dropped,11
100 IQ Gill,3
Ferguson to Cummins: Anything you can do I can do better.,8
"Lmao yes deny that single, Gill you idiot",7
Gill now looks like an idiot after denying that single and getting out nxt bowl,11
Honestly Ferguson has looked like one of their most comfortable batsmen and he‚Äôs only been there 9 balls. If he stays he can get them to 150,12
"Mayank making it to all 3 squads, I want him to be the next Indian legend",10
"Gill and strike rate below 130 is a bitter-sweet love story
6/10",3
"I think it's a plot of vk to not include RS. If KL performs good there is no point of picking RS. Hence proved, vk doesn't like RS.",-1
"Wait, is Rohit out for rest of the IPL as well?",8
"Bowler takes 3-4 wickets, me expecting commentator to appreciate and praise him , commentator : "" plenty of fantasy points from him today "" . Bruh",9
Gill outüéâüéâüòä,4
Half of the people here suffer from recency bias. IPL is not the only parameter for selection people.,10
KKRüòÇüòÇüòÇ,2
"Varun Chakravarthy made it ? Haha lmao.

Good for him tho",6
Natarajan will be going to Aus as ‚Äúan additional bowler.‚Äù Not sure if that means a net bowler or a backup bowler. But hey it‚Äôs at least something.,5
Denying a single with 10 balls to go and 3 wickets in hand when your partner is on 16 off 9.,10
"Gill is equivalent to DITTO the pokemon..

whatever the frick the non striker does he will do the same..

Please russell come back And open with that fricker",10
"Bowl all your best bowlers the first 10 overs, if you want a chance.",4
"**18.3** Mohammed Shami to Shubman Gill, OUT, low full toss, right in the hitting slot, but he hits this straight to deep midwicket. Just a chip instead of a full-blooded slog. Perhaps Shami denied him any slogging room by following him **136-8**

Shubman Gill c Pooran b Mohammed Shami 57 (45b 3x4 4x6) SR: 126.66",3
LETTSS GOO,2
Well Gill tried to be hero,4
"Last time KL Rahul did same and gets out.
Next time learn from others mistake",5
Cummins getting premium over Ferguson is like Japanese products premium over South Korean. Sometimes the difference is just the brand name.,5
Guys source for the ind squad??,3
Ferguson looks like a decent batsman. Should have been sent instead of Nagarkoti.,5
KKR made more in those 6-7 overs than all the other overs combined.,4
Who's the chief selector?,3
"Bishnoi deserved to be in the T20i squad, not Chakravarthy !",5
"If brohit inclusion is uncertain in aus tour, idts he'll play in ipl now....right?",5
"Now that pant is not selected, he should play freely in ipl. Just be aggressive!",11
Can you guys imagine if Chakravarthy gets cunted today lmao I'd wanna see Indian selectors faces,9
"Last time we got a single denied at Sharjah, a Tewatia happened. Y'all just can't see Lord Gill's Massive Brain.",21
Wait. The squads announced?:,9
"I‚Äôm happy with the three squads. With KL being the LOI keeper now and considering Pant‚Äôs poor outfield fielding, him being excluded from LOI squads is not a surprise. Good to see that Pant is in test squad. He was pretty good in the last tour. With no Rohit, toss up between KL and Shaw seems likely for the opener spot(assuming Rohit doesn‚Äôt recover)",5
Godamn lokie .... He is kkr Archer,9
And he denied him that single,6
"Punjab bowling attack looking very very solid in these past 2-3 games. Spinners, pacers, everyone joining the party",5
That was stupid from GILL,4
Lockieeee shot bud!,2
Lol and Gill had the gall to deny Fergi the strike,7
Baz: That's my boy!,2
"Every run fergi hits will make gill look like an idiot

C'mon Ferguson",15
"Ferguson: Fine, I'll do it myself",7
Fergie showing Gill how it's done.,9
Ayo wtf why is Ferguson smashing sixes,8
Wtf lockie dude. Whatcha doin,7
"Feel sad for Kuldeep, first he got replaced by Chakravarthy in KKR, now he got replaced by Chakravarthy in the Indian side",12
"Ok, will Ferguson actually get them to 160?",1
My dyslexic eyes always read his name as Subhuman lol,6
Lockie ki sabji can bat.,5
Ferguson came in out of syllabus,5
Gill denied a single to [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGy_q0XhZJk/?igshid=qtoncpkrhhgy) puppy-loving man,7
"Sending Nagarkoti instead of Lockie, LOL",8
Hahahaha chomu Gill was denying strike to this guy.,10
Chakravarthy is an architect turned specialist spinner. How on earth can he even make contact with a fast full toss by Shami!?,11
Ferguson's going to win Man on the Match. I feel it in my bones,6
KKR: we collapse twice bitches,5
So they were hiding their best batsman,13
"Damn, Ferguson is striking it so well, I wonder why Gill denied that single.",9
Lockie is the new Cummins.,7
Whats with this aussie fkin bowlers mate.. they can bat better than aussie batsmen lmao,5
Pls under 160,5
Ferguson should have been sent in before Nagarkoti if KKR wanted to score runs.,20
Lol why is kkr just now figuring what all Ferguson can do? üòÇ,22
The ground actually is pretty small. It‚Äôs just KKR struggling with losing wickets,8
"If Russel comes back, I don‚Äôt see how Cummins could keep his spot now that Ferguson has displayed his batting abilities.",14
Taking doogna run a ball- in character,3
What's a good target for kkr,5
Are denied singles a catalyst for batsman to go nuts?,16
"Every time someone says Bc lara in the dugout the indian inside me laughs 
 üòÑ",21
That's not Leg Byes that is Lund Byes.,13
New Zealand tail Enders are so talented,7
Another retirement announcement coming from Rayudu now?,17
"Guys, check Marlon Samuel‚Äôs Instagram story",5
What's par here,1
Wonder if Chakravarthy knows he's been selected to the national team!,14
"Future prospect, plays with a strike rate of 126 at Sharjah.",6
Very good sqaud selection,5
Why did Gill refuse that single?,8
Gill looking like even more of a nonce now.,13
Are the squads subject to change? Because BCCI tweeted something about monitoring Ishant and Rohit's conditions,8
"Poor Shami, bowled better than 3-35.",40
Rahul getting selected for test squad means Gill will be cucked once again.,12
Shubman Gill turning down a single to Ferguson and then getting out. Plus Ferguson hitting a six off the the next ball sums up Shubmans IPL.,25
"Everybody talking about Rohit but no one mentioning Ishant. He is more important to India's test chances than Rohit or Kohli

Hope gets fit in time.",29
VC why don't run for the double?,8
I'm not even KKR fan and their stupid decison to not send Ferguson up the order is still infuriating me...I wonder what KKR fans are feeling.,12
KL Rahul is now VC of the T20I team in Rohit's absence. Noice.,40
fuckkker was declining singles to Lockie,14
Ferguson da MVP.,7
Is 150 defendable in Sharjah?,5
Why isn‚Äôt Pant in the squad? Injury?,6
I am not getting why Gill is getting criticised now. If his innings came in when rest were scoring at 200 SR+ criticism would have been understandable. But he more or less stood through 2 collapses.,43
Why is varun selected?,3
Pls get a 3rd man.,1
Chakravarthy looks like he's seen so much in his life.,36
Poor bowing from Jordon.,-2
Don't blame him that he deny the single. Poor guy was watching shit show and didn't wanted to give strike to anyone,3
The players in the KKR team have no chemistry,1
i just read varun ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä 's mother is Hema Malini.. wtf!??,9
Makes you wonder if Baz has been just doodling all this while in that book of his /s,9
Even though mi can win without rohit (assuming he'll be injured) his captaincy and bowling changes will be missed,5
"Ferguson is striking at almost 200 , imagine KXIP batsmen",7
"I think Rahul and Mayank will open in test.

Great comback for Rahul he will be playing test after a long time.",7
Pant failed yo yo test,19
If Morgan doesn't bowl Lockie again first up. I'll be fuming,4
Lockie Ferguson better batsman then Glen Maxwell confirmed,14
Appeal twice to get the wicket! /s,5
Gill getting into the test squad and not getting to play for the 69th time,29
Karthik is probably the worst commentator in the whole panel.,18
Chakravarty's bats broken lmao,10
On the positive side the  ball went to the boundary,11
Gill is the type of guy who jerks off while looking at himself in the mirror.,15
Heartattack moment :(,4
Time for Kings XI to make this an interesting chase,11
Another one!,3
Lol why not just hit single and get Ferguson on strike,8
playing rahul in test isnt that good of a move. I'm expecting india to be 50/4 with pujara 10(40)\* on strike after first session of the 1st test,18
Chakravarthy celebrating his selection by playing that absurd shot lmao,12
Ball went to the boundary but at what cost? Task failed successfully lol.,7
"Gill was just trying to hit Shami, as he had tonked him for two sixes the 3rd over. Chill guys.",13
Someone give Charkravarthy good news asap! Let's see how he bowls today!,17
"**19.5** Jordan to Varun, OUT, looks to ramp it instead of looking to take the single to hand over the strike to Ferguson. Jordan beats him and uproots the leg stump **149-9**

CV Varun  b Jordan 2 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00",2
varuns celebration for selection.,6
UNDER 150 GREAT,7
"Well done, Jordan",8
[deleted],9
Fantastic over from Jordan,5
Punjab's match to lose.,1
What's the lowest total defended this IPL other than that SRH vs KXIP game?,4
"To be honest, from 10/3, never though KKR will reach 149! We will lose, but at least it is something to bowl to.",1
"From 94/4, they couldn't even get 150!",11
Jordan is brilliant,3
Disappointing.,6
Jordan! Where was this kind of death bowling when we needed you in 2016?!?!,3
"Dhoni derailed Indian Cricket.

We were the best team in the world but never played like one because of his take it deep strategies.

Now, we want another Dhoni and have already fucked up Pant in the chase for one.

How much more will the love for a flawed man cost this country!",-18
Given that they were 80 from 8 overs this is a great comeback,9
At one point KKR was looking at 180+. How did they end up here?,5
Jordan: I took that personally,7
Brilliant knock by Prasidh,10
"T20I squad: Virat Kohli (Capt), Shikhar, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (vc & wk), Shreyas Iyer, Manish, Hardik Pandya, Sanju Samson (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd. Shami, Navdeep Saini, Deepak Chahar, Varun Chakravarthy

ODI squad: Virat Kohli (Capt), Shikhar Dhawan, Shubman Gill, KL Rahul (vc & wk), Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Mayank Agarwal, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd. Shami, Navdeep Saini, Shardul Thakur

Test squad: Virat Kohli (Capt), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar, Ajinkya(vc), Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, Saha (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Bumrah, Mohd. Shami, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, R. Ashwin, Mohd. Siraj",11
Jordan has been really good after a couple of average games at the start. KXIP chopped and changed too much in the beginning stages.,13
150 against KKR bowling won‚Äôt be easy but the wicket is decent for batting,12
The bowlers did really well to recover from that freak Morgan innings,16
After watching this innings just shows how much Shaw is valuable even if inconsistent,12
"Singh is King, King is Singh.",8
KL and Gayle will get this done in 17 overs.,6
Jordan's redemption has been something else though man,20
"First 10: 91/4

Last 10: 58/5",7
Reminder that kkr were 80-3 after 8 overs,8
*Halla bol halla bol halla bol halla bol halla bol halla bol* crying my mind out.,3
"KKR win all boils down to how Ferguson, Narine and Chalravarthy performs",6
[deleted],17
"Very good again from Jordan

Glad he's doing well",7
what did Marlon Samuels post on his IG story? i don't have ig right now. can someone please post a screenshot?,3
CJ is an asset,7
Can we get a nice and easy stress free chase please?,10
Whats with tailenders not dashing for a last ball run when many games have been decided by very narrow margins.. Its not like improving their batting average is going to win them a spot in the team,7
Indian selectors are jokers lmao,11
Cat Pummins,3
So varun keeping Kuldeep Yadav out from India too,7
KXIP will win in the 19th over with 4 wickets remaining,6
How unclucky is Suryakumar Yadav?,12
Even if Punjab loses the next game I am not backing this KKR team to win games against RR and CSK.#jinx,8
Happy to see Chakravarthy getting selected for the Australia tour.,6
RIFT‚Ñ¢ already started on Twitter.,7
Happy for Chakravarty to get a T20I debut,7
KXIP gonna lose this match. 4th time is never the charm,-4
"149 might be under par, but never estimate Meme XI Punjab to take it to the last ball of the match!",10
If Mayank was fit this would have been an  easy chase,12
KXIP will finish this within 15 overs? Let's see. A man can dream OK.,3
Alright KXIP got this! What a turnaround this has been!!,2
srs question.. does India actually have any other good death bowler than Bumrah?.. I don't consider Shami a consistent death bowler.. he can really get cunted most of the days.,3
It really does feel like there‚Äôs not much gelling or strong connection between overseas players and Indian players in KKR. Other team videos like DC or SRH or MI and on field vibes so different,14
"Oh my.... DK has had the worst season, hasn't he?",2
"Damn seeing chakravarthy,I think I should give cricket a second chance now.",16
90 in first 10 and 50 in last 10. That‚Äôs what happens when you send your finisher at No.4 and play a batsman short.,7
Do we still have a chance??,7
"Easy wins: *exists*

KXIP: and I took that personally",10
"Wait I wasn't watching, so DK took a review for that shit? did he not know that he hit it?",6
"*BTW*

So Rohit Sharma is not going to Australia for ODI and T20.

If it's due to injury and not because of his personal choice, MI will be under Pollard for some time.

Shubman and Varun from today's match are deserving of selection and they did.",4
"Shami & CJ have been absolutely immense for KXIP as their death bowlers.

Tbh...I really don't associate them (esp.Shami) as proper death bowling options but feeling happy that I'm getting proved wrong. Lets go Lions !",14
Hopefully they open with Gayle,12
"Top order shit the bed , then we came back and then shit the bed again

At least the murti visarjan DJ here is playing Tip tip barsa pani , not that bad of a day .",10
KXIP gonna collapse like dominoes,-6
Man of the match is Ferguson with his 24 off 13 and 4-16 bowling figures,3
The morgan wicket so timely. Difference between us chasing 150 vs 190,9
"Also this will be either a close game, or we'll lose horribly. No other option. You guys need to remember that we have only batting till 4",4
Hope Pant is mentally strong enough to come out of this minor setback. Getting dropped from even ODI must be heart breaking,9
This whole season is a proof that KKR are still in this game.,6
"CSK fans: CSK pe position mein unki (Thala) ki koi galti nahi, theek hai.",1
Yo what is going on with the Marlon Samuels situation with Ben Stokes.,4
"KXIP is the most entertaining side this IPL and its funny how its not even close.

It only helps that some of their players like KL Rahul and Arshdeep look dead inside lol.",11
Look at how the BCCI massacred my boi (Rishabh Pant),15
Ashwin still not picked in LOIs. He'll not be salty about it at all.,11
I don't hate KKR. I just want KKIP to win.,31
Talk about most explosive batting order KXIP is up there...but damn these guys go around with two of the most aggressive spinners.,3
KL Rahul vice captain for LOI in australia because of Rohit‚Äôs unavailability,9
Shubman looks really good while playing his shots. Better than kohli in 6s.,7
Daily reminder that Punjab were 1-6 at one point,18
Is siraj a good test bowler?,7
I would absolutely love to see Gayle come out to open and get a 100 even though we are only chasing 150 and absolutely obliterate KKR's NRR,14
"Siraj, Jordan, Stokes all sent a big F you to r/cricket

Can Maxi do it??",17
"**Most Wickets for KXIP in IPL season**

Andrew Tye - 24

Mohammed Shami - 20*

Sreesanth - 19

Mohammed Shami - 19",14
Ashwin should‚Äôve been given a chance in all formats imo,12
"Absolutely stoked that Kings XI bowlers has come to the party and bowling out or almost bowling out sides now. This was a real flaw at the beginning of the tourney (ex. vs CSK), so I'm very appreciative that they've turned it around. Come on Kings XI, let's get this and transform Sharjah into the Lions Den.",7
But but but my south Indian friend said Indian selectors hate south Indians!!!!!,4
KXIP don‚Äôt fuck this up or i will hate you more than Iyer‚Äôs captaincy this IPL. I can‚Äôt sleep because I don‚Äôt know what kind of crap he will pull off tomorrow.,10
Counter attack was a double edged sword. Pair that up with KKR's long tail and that made the choice all the more risky,6
From thinking Pant could be Dhoni's successor to absolutely shitting his bed... what has happened to you my boy pant :(,8
Do or Die for KKR,3
So Rohit Sharma is out of IPL. Since he is not fit enough to play for the Indian squad. Suddenly Mumbai looks fragile.,8
Why has Manimaran Siddharth not being given a chance yet?,2
Who ever is going to play DC next should watch out for Pant madness.,13
"realistically how hard would it even be for Pant to cut like 10-15 lbs? With all the resources at his behest, he could do it in a month and a half",10
Taking a wicket maiden in the 16th over of a t20 match. Absolute madlads.,8
If KXIP win this year. I would be perfect for a Netflix documentry,12
Marlon Samuels you absolute madlad,3
"No matter what happens today, KXIP should think what is Maxwell doing in the team.

Why not give so many chances to the redditor? 

When was last time Maxwell performed?",4
Shami has really worked well on his game in lockdown and has actually on his game,5
[deleted],9
Just want to remind all that Dhoni will not be playing for India anymore.,21
The absence of Rohit Sharma & Risabh might just be an opportunity for KL to cement an opening spot(or even no.4) in limited format. Really pleased with Mayank getting selected as well.,6
"If Kxip win this I just hope the writers for last 2 matches are not Game of Thrones writers, they will ruin the climax.",9
"Lol I skipped KKR's last match and they won 

I just tuned in and they are going to lose 

Lol",-3
Need Kxip to win and lose remaining games for RR to make it to the playoffs as run rate much better,-1
I‚Äôm convinced that Marlon Samuels is either drunk or high as a kite(refer to his ig story for context),10
Please for the love of god open with Gayle.,5
Can Mumbai not afford to drop Coulter Nile/ Pattinson and get in boult? Are their other Indian bowlers unplayable?,2
Fucking joke opening with Gayle you dense mother fuckers,3
"Varun getting selected on one 5fer!!. Ashwin's doing wonderfully, Chahar is good too. Gopal being fine for a long time. Bishnoi looking good too...I don't see the logic. He's not a mystery anymore if he's playing 14 ipl games",6
"Ffs, still no Gayle as opener.",5
"Is anyone still in doubt about KXIP's victory 

This seems like a very easy chase",2
KXIP please play out Narine FFS,8
Is the pitch assisting bowlers?,2
"Please don't fuck this up, KXIP. We need you to play through the innings, KL",3
[deleted],0
Marlon Samuels [story](https://i.imgur.com/g457tW4.jpg),6
Please Sanju score big in the next 3 games. Justify your selection.,3
"Indian selectors r/cricket browsers confirmed after today's call.

Bunch of bandwagon jumpers. Lol. That Indian team is utter trash honestly and will struggle to beat even Bangladesh, who dare I say, are a very decent team.",1
"No Gayle?? If nothing else, they could have thought about left right combination",2
it has to be maxwell's day today. just feel it.,5
Wtf was that,4
Pant out of ODI?,2
4 off the start BrO!,3
WTF PRASIDH,4
"People saying MI will miss Rohit Sharma's captaincy are just forgetting the fact, how good Polly is as a captain & a leader.

As a batsman:yep they will miss him, but not as a captain in my unbiased opinion",8
Prasidh wtf,6
"Mandeep will prob be the aggressor today. He's doing a lot better mentally, reckon he goes on to have a pretty good innings today. 

First 3 overs crucial",6
Wouldn‚Äôt Gayle opening be better. He can‚Äôt make use of lifted field restrictions with quick singles,4
Cummins has to get both rahul n gayle in his first spell for a chance,5
i think spinners aren't going to be so impactful in the aus tour especially those who cant get the ball to bounce. Lyon is good in australia because he can pitch the ball well more than his ability to spin. Hope Pujara is in form because he will need to bail us out,12
No Prasid. You cannot do that,6
How not to field lol,13
LOOOOOL way to set to tone.,4
Lol why was he not looking at the ball?,7
lmao this tops Samads misfield the other day,9
"We need ""strike rate is very, very overrated"" KL today.",15
If Lockie doesn't get the new ball then this team is done,3
Ez win for KXIP,2
[deleted],6
Inject that shit right into my veins baby go kxip,0
[deleted],3
"Not opening will gayle in a ground like sharjah chasing 7.5 rpo?

Don't u want to go home early?",6
How do you midfield that lol,8
Prasidh ka prasad,7
now that the squad has been announced I can start waiting for the test series to start till December and get mad because KL nicks off Starc with 0(2) within 5 minutes.,16
"KXIP should be careful first 3-4 overs until the ball stops swinging. After that, it should be easy",6
Crucial part for KXIP is to not lose wickets in the first 4. Run rate be damned,9
Genuine question: is Lockie better used outside of the powerplay? Why?,8
If Gayle was opening the match would've been over by now,11
We'll only play lockie when the game gets away from us,5
Gayle comes at 1 down so that he can shower long enough. He performs well only post shower and massage.,9
Prasidh gonna get tonked.,8
Give the fookin new ball to fooking Lockie,10
What happened to Mayank?,6
I cant wait to see how mandeep is gonna fuck up another opportunity.. looks like a solid player yet never works,8
Looking forward to Aus series. See ya in December ya cunts,7
Wait is Rohit Sharma ruled out from ipl?,5
"Eoin Shubhman kinda proved it's easier to score after getting your eye in. 

Altho Shubhman fucked up at the end but he's young",9
"Yeah, Lockie is a batsman, isnt he? Why should he bowl in the powerplay anyway? Genius KKR",13
Open with Gayle and give new ball to Lockie. How hard is it aargh,2
Mayank was so fun to watch,7
"Ayo they've got Narine and varun , swing now itself.",9
"Hey Bhaiya, is it the line to trade srk with ambani?",4
"Everybody is so busy with Rohit and Pant missing out, no one noticed no Ishant Sharma in tests.",10
"If Maxwell fails today, sign him up for that Thumka challenge with his new stance",8
Don't understand the logic of Gayle at 3,7
Can someone explain the physics of why only a new ball will swing?,9
"Rohit ruled out of remaining IPL matches, even year casting its spell",6
"Off the mark, phew",2
"Why are the only Muslim Indian players we see in the IPL are fast bowlers?

Genuine question not a troll",-7
Mayank‚Äôs absence gonna hurt us,12
They're saving lockie for gayle,3
"I really want to know why indian tailenders (the bowlers specifically) are so shit at batting?? I mean they can barely connect bat with ball whereas, all tailenders across all other nations can atleast swing the bat and contribute something to the score.",45
"KL you beauty!

Beautiful punch through the gap",8
"""The universe boss is never nervous"" - universe boss",16
"After watching the Dugout throughout this season, I get major PTSD whenever I see an Altroz on the road",12
That was fucking beautiful from Nagarkoti,11
What an effort that,7
Outfield kinda slow?,3
Whatt a punch! KL is pleasing in the eye.,7
Gayle v Ferguson is the key battle here. Narine would have figured in too but his corrected action has limited him.,9
Khaleel not even traveling as net bowler?,3
"Elegant drive, deserved 4 for that shot",2
"Cummins, Lockie, Prasid, Nagarkoti, Narine, Chakravarthy - quite a long bowling attack",5
chakravathy is exciting but surely Axar deserved a go in the AUS LOI squad?,4
That was a good run and save at boundary.,3
"I feel sad for cricketers who've a good natural defensive game, but mould their game to do well in IPL.


Pujara acknowledged and was able to stick to Test cricket. But I'd hate to see someone like Shubman being caught in the middle.",7
Can they like find another car sponsor instead of that ugly looking Altroz. Its such a sore in the eye.,7
Mandeep finna putting pressure on KL,5
Kxip has started fucking this up,5
Mandeep is walking in the next few overs,3
"Kids calm down, we got plenty time",6
Mandy playing some brilliant shots for dots lol,6
Oooh straight to the fielder,1
"Mandeep is good batsman, but I kinda doubt his ability as opener. Gayle should be the first choice opener.",7
Come on Mandeep mate. 1 off 8 is ridiculous,11
Mandy perfectly timing the shots to the fielder,-1
Cummins going to get tonked.,2
"I‚Äôm not even mad at Mandeep, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs taking these dots for the team. Beautiful display of pace, this is.",4
This will do for now lmao,4
"Either Mandeep is going to explode, or cause Rahul to do something counter productive with all this pressure.",1
"Ashwin averages 29 and has an ER of 7.93 this season. How are those comeback worthy numbers?
Like Saha in Tests, Ashwin in IPL is one of those players who always gets called 'underrated' when he does well but doesn't get criticised when he fails.",5
LMAO such is state of mandeep singh.. plays a shot over the field for a single,5
Mandeep doesn‚Äôt want to Batdeep,9
"Why would you try to get Mandeep out when you know Gayle will be coming next?

Try to get Rahul out, if you can!",2
Ohno punjab about to do a Punjab I can feel it,3
Mandy is not getting the timing right. Shots are good but placement and timing are kinda off,6
Great running,1
They should have tried Prabsimran as an opener.,2
Agarwal is being missed ngl. He was the proper aggressor of the team,11
Where did Prabhsimran go? He was power play king,4
"Mandy should‚Äôve been rested, dude‚Äôs still not completely mentally fine",10
I genuinely have no idea why they don‚Äôt swap Gayle and Mandeep. Seems like the no brainer to end all no brainers.,12
Too late to audition for the Indian test team mate,9
Mandeep is late while facing decent pace. He can't be an opener,6
PAT CUMMINS 8TH LMFAOOO,3
Bruh my crush got into a relationship with someone. I just cant :(,13
"I hear a word ""intent""  a lot in this IPL season",2
Rohit Sharma ruled out of IPL?,1
"Can anyone tell me which stadium this is?

Blunder to open with Mandeep,3
"Mandeep Singh is a below avg player
I don't know how the dude has managed to play till now üòë he was sub par with RCB 
not shockingly he has been picked by RCB lite!!",-1
Mandeep with that test match level SR: 20.0,2
"Why do they insist on playing Prasidh, where is Mavi?",5
This should have been 7/0 in 3 overs! That bad miss field! Could have put much more pressure on the batsmen!,1
Mandeep singh Jadhav,4
"What do y'all think is the hardest for a batsman to hit? A good swing, seam, or spin delivery?",3
Misfield four aside this is a super start by the opening bowlers helped by good fielding too,6
"Never thought I'll see a player sr lower while batting with kl ""sr is overrated"" rahul",4
This is pretty awful. Horrific decision that almost cost us the game is still being persisted with.,3
Marlon samuels' Instagram comments are very rude. Hope he apologizes,9
"Gayle opening would result in exactly what happened with Rana opening btw

Early wicket and rest of upper middle order fucked",5
How young is Mandeep Singh? He got some spark going around there,4
"If only narine gets back in his groove today

All of gayle, pooran n maxy struggle against him",5
Why didn't mandeep take a leave for his father. Something like this takes a toll on you mentally.,12
Is Mandeep going to get out to a man in the deep?,10
Hooda is so shit,1
Umm don't we have Gayle as an opener? Why are we just playing dots?,4
Bruh why isn't Gayle opening smh,3
Prasidh getting tonked has begun.,7
"KKR wins this match, they are hell of the most luckiest team.",9
Rahul turning the heat back on with the boundaries,6
mi got Chris Lynn to cripple kkr,4

Great start imo. The threatful overs are done.,11
Why do they treat the powerplay as something to see off. Its just going to make the chase harder later. Batsmen should be playing more shots.,4

Time for people to panic for the next hour just to calm down and eat their words later,9
Need to combine a pic of Mccullum taking notes with Trump displaying treaty signature meme,3
I feel universe boss should open. He is an established opener. One big over in the powerplay would ease all the pressure. KXIP are missing this trick,11
Show the lbw relay,2
That pitched outside?,1
And the thriller story begins,6
Looked not out.. sliding down. Ump's call at best.,7
Rahul knows no one is close to taking the orange cap from him so didn't bother.,4
KL could have reviewed it but he accepted it unlike DK who had a clear edge but was so confident. The ball may have missed leg stump.,5
"Again I'm telling you guys, good season, good comeback, but the reason we lost those 6 games in a row and are going to lose this game is because of absolute no good brain dead management. Absolute wastemen. Fuck the power play up and get strangled by their spinners. No planning just vibes.",10
"I don't understand..why the hell does Punjab strategy always seem to be ""Make things more difficult for yourself than they need to be!""?",10
Waiting for ball tracking so that we can get an extra reason to shit on Mandeep /s,6
Lord Gayle: I have been summoned,10
"I don't understand these rules...What is the point of having a third umpire when he is not used in game deciding decisions like these? Why is there a need to ""review"" a wicket, it should be the standard imo.",5
That shit powerplay has let KKR back in the game. 8.58 with the spinners bowling already could be tight. Mandeep is playing a FC match here. Gayle should've opened.,11
"Kkr have already lost this, no way are they defending this low total with Gayle coming in and Pooran to follow next",3
I kind of find it weird that Mandeep has not left for India to see his father for one last time. I completely understand that he must have received this opportunity as opener after so much struggle and it must have been very hard for him to play in previous match and might have been very critical for his career too. But I guess few things are far more important than career. But then it's his personal decision and one needs to respect that.,5
"Don't take it deep, don't take it deep. 

_They took it deep._",14
Should mandatorily use review for close calls. Umpire's call don't love review.,3
Hope Rohit is fit by the Aus tour. Need him as the VC and Chad opener,4
Can someone eli5 narines old action?,0

Spinners are bowling right now so as to negate dew effect?,6
"Ohh, so it was out.",6
Gayle vs Narine will be a mouthwatering contest!,5
What is this tuk tuk,1
Me to KXIP: ***TakeItForward TakeItForward***,7
Mandeep doesn't gel with KL. He should really just be at 5 if he plays.,10
Should have let Maxi open instead of Mandeep,6

With these two the run rate would be decent in begining of powerplay because of mayank and if gayle sets we all know what would happen later . Kl could come 1 down and play the anchor role easily if he wants to

Ps - ik mayank isnt playing , just staying this could have been the order from the beginning",4

"Unpopular opinion: DRS should be cancelled. Whenever a team appeals, umpire should decide whether to review or not (similar to runout or VAR in football).


One of the criticism for this has been that it adds lot of time to the game which is already long. So this is what I propose.


The on-field umpire should then tell his area of doubt (pitching or hitting, sometimes more than one area or sometimes umpire is certain its out). 3rd umpire should then check that thing 1st (this saves a lot of unnecessary time). A lot of times, it'll be impact outside, so then no need to go through the whole 9 yards. If its impact in line, then they can check other things like edge, hitting, etc.


But care needs to be taken that umpires dont send everything upstairs like they do today with runouts.",10

Weird seeing Binga with a gut lol,3
Gayle is winning it for them unless lockie does something,2
"Why are people upset with Mandeep? Yes, his runrate is a tad slow but Punjab is not short of firepower. They need someone to anchor one end of the crease and he is doing exactly that.

Yes, it is only 20 overs but you still need to build the innings.",6
Kxip removing kkr from this season too,3
This ground is net practice for the universe boss,9
LEGACY,1
Ferguson got injured shit,3
I have a feeling Kumble does not like Gayle much.  Didn't play him even though Gayle was fit for the first 5 or 6 games and now denying Gayle batting in the powerplay.  Horrible decision to play mandeep in the powerplay and not Gayle,-2
"I don't even care which team he's playing for, I always love to see Gayle score.",6
"Imagine telling a young Gayle to play *responsibly* and which leads him to curb his natural game and play *responsibly*. Makes you wonder what would have happened eh, makes you wonder",8
Imagine what Gayle could have done with the 32 balls Mandeep played.,4
Gayle in Sharjah should be illegal.,4
Bouncy boi Fergs should be on now,2
Gayle can tuk tuk his way through the chase with the occasional six.,4
I feel low key they need Ferguson now,3
"Mandeep builds up unnecessary pressure -

**KL** - ""fuck me, I gotta bat out of my skin and make up for this bullshit"".

**Gayle** - ""fuck you, I'm going to bat the way I do and not worry about your bullshit"".",9
That's some nerve from Gayle.,2
[removed],4
I like this new role of Gayle. Get a fast 12-15 ball 30-35. Don't worry about getting out just keep on going.,6
Gayle was the spark KXIP missing at start of the tournament.,10
if they remove gayle the match will get real interesting,7
Having Gayle is unfair,4
"Stop simping for random women, simp for the universe bossüòç",8
"Eoin : nobody can hit our mystery bowlers


Chris : *OBSERVE*",7
KKR needs to drop a bowler for batsman. Siddesh Lad has to come-in.,2
"Why tf are yall hating on Mandeep, he‚Äôs playing exactly like he needs to for a small target",10
Bowl Lockie you dense fuck,3
Eoin Morgan has forgotten Lockie exists.,11
"Lmao mandy be like,  Ferguson who?",3
Thank fuck for that boundary off Mandy's blade,5
If someone gives the excuse of Dhoni's age for his disgraceful batting..show them Chris Gayle,14
Mandy joinin‚Äô the party,3
Welcome Lockie,2
"MY NAME IS MANDEEEP,
AND I'M GONNA GO DEEP,
 IMMA WIN IT FOR MY PEEP.",7
C'mon guys hold your nerve ffs,1
Is Gayle wearing an orange helmet?,2
Sharjah ain't big enough for Gayle,4
Fasten your seatbelts boiis. It's time for lift-off!,3
"Gayle - 13(5)

Mandeep - 26(30)


So Gayle has half the number of runs in 1/6th of balls. 

I have a crazy theory that Gayle should have opened. One could try and see how Gayle fairs as opener.",11
"I don't think Ferguson has an uncanny knack of picking up wickets, I think he's a genuine wicket taker and there's a difference.",6
Hahahaha Lockie's mad,5
Need to remind Morgan that Lockie is a New Zealand player and not Aussie.,4
Mandeep likes pace I guess,1
Eating lauki ki sabzi watching Lockie bowl,4
If Gayle was Indian the system would've grinded him down to a 130 SR batsman,1
I haven‚Äôt been watching IPL for long so are KKR just shit or what,5
 Cut Mandeep to shreds,0
[deleted],-11
"An anchor needs to play at a strike rate of 110-115 with the ability to increase it to 140 minimum. 

Playing at a strike rate of 80-90 is not what a fucking anchor does in T20s.",9
With Rohit's exclusion all of a sudden Punjab are favourites,5
Hope Mandeep takes most of the strike. Dont want those bouncers to Gayle,4
No hitting from one end. No running from the other. such is life,11
Wide ffa,3
G A S,6
"Have they added that ""oooh"" sound effect for this match. Overusing it tbh",5
Lockie Ferguson reminds me of Shaun Tait... can get a lot of wickets on his day.. otherwise its just spray and pray,9
We need effin wickets,2
Ferguson really deserves the 69 number,7
"1000runs in 3 seasons for KXIP ,from Chris Gayle.

Pretty good coming from a 41year old.",19
"I dont get why you'd choose a stable anchoring batsman like Mandeep to open. Wouldn't he be better in the middle order, preventing a collapse?",5
"Mandy is playing just right according to the run rate, stop shitting on him",6
sexy four by Universe Boss Love Machine ‚ù§Ô∏è üí¶üí¶ *slurp *slurp *slurp,5
How can you not bowl your best bowler for 11 overs against a top heavy side? Fucking insane. Somebody needs to sack the entire KKR management asap. Fuck is Baz thinking? Not gonna blame Eoin cuz it's evident that the captains have no say in the decisions.,5
Gayle goodness mofo,3
Today's Forecast: Gayle Storm!,5
love you lockie but we need this win thanks,8
Who needs 1s and 2s when the whole universe is inside you?,8
"Winning is more important than strike rate

Feel like KL hasn't taught you guys well",8
Lockie moustache >>> all other IPL moustaches.,7
Twas good whilst it lasted,2
"Goodbye guys, see you in the next season : )",3
Jeez. What a shot from the boss. Delicate,8
"Thats an unbelievable stat, he's played 3 seasons for KXIP and has already got 1000 runs for the franchise in the twilight of his career.",11
What's with the GAS obsession?,3
So is this the night of Krishnappa Gallayya aka Kishandeep Gill to score another century,1
Anyone gonna volunteer for the kkr sadness thread?,6
If RCB is against KXIP in the playoffs RCB is fucked.,8
this definitely isnt gayles last season,4
I don‚Äôt think the bowlers can do anything today. Today is Gayle‚Äôs day.,3
64 off 48..,2
This game is far from over but much better guys c'mon,0
"Fuck, we brought Gayle into form :(",2
"Batting at a run rate of 7.3 ish

Reqd rate of 8

Yet complains about the pace of the chase, smh",0
Wtf is that colgate spray ad? üò≠,7
Gayle is on fire. Should‚Äôve opened with him,7
Gayle‚Äôs timing is just incredible. He has power yes but he always sees the ball so well.,3
"Chris Gayle is the Sergio Aguero of cricket

Gets injured half the season. Still somehow ends up getting good output.",2
33 off 6 overs for Mandeep.,2
Is RR still in contention? Practically speaking.,2
What an amazing impact Gayle has been... Quick runs in the middle overs and killing matches down while chasing. Aggressive No. 3 doin just fine,3
"Morgan is a world cup winning captain due to an overthrow, he is clueless with bowling plans and field positions",4
Are we literally out if we lose this one?,1
Do you guys Reckon Lockie's action is sustainable in the long run? Looks like he has to bend his lower back to a great extent to obtain pace.,2
KXIP giving hope for RR and SRH and eventually they are gonna make it to the playoffs.,2
"The Universe Boss never loses it. But enough about Stokes, Gayle isn't doing too badly either.",5
You can't save a strike bowler until the 12th over and expect him to work a miracle. Best time to break a partnership is *before* Gayle hits 3 sixes.,3
My conclusion from watching KKR is that their Indian batsmen are a huge pile of wank,4
Mandeep Singh needs to score fast or just lose his wicket so we can see Pooran wrap up this match.,1
lmao Gayle running quick singles... goodnight KKR,2
They r not going to bowl Nagarkoti?,1
"Good night guys, it looks like game over.",7
Imagine Gayle in MI,5
"As a neutral, I love seeing Loki bowl.",3
It's all fun and games until it's 104/3...,2

I won't even be mad if we only get 20 of Narine's spell. Fuck that ball hiding shifty cunt.,-2
Love whenever Gayle has to run,6
Big DICK SIX Universe Boss Love Machine,2
DK is worth Gayle‚Äôs piss,4
FUCK! I am getting a heartattack now.,7
lmfao so much gas,6
Oof,1
so does Punjab have to win the rest of their matches and KKR to lose their rest for Punjab to get 4th?,3
yes yes BRING ON THE GAYLESTORM,2
"Punjab in the middle overs are excellent, pooran and gayle can‚Äôt be contained. I questioned it at first but moving gayle to middle order has turned out to be inspired.",3
KING GAYLE,3
Jeez spinners must be shitting bricks bowling to this guy,3
"Mandeep also played for RCB, right?",3
Holy shit that‚Äôs cunted,3
"Smh Jordan 

If you had run properly before that superover fiasco, then Brohit would've avoided the injury. 5D chess by England to advance in the Test Championship. /s",12
Gayle u cutie,2
Narine my boi lost his touch it seems after the action change,2
Cheat code turned on,6
"As I said before, we are on easy course and majority of yous gonna be eating ur words",3
Gayle üòçüòç,3
It's tragic now to see Lockie coming in when the momentum is very much out of KKR's reach.,3
"Chris Gayle in Sharjah, Ned",3
C R U N C H !!!,3
"Don't you worry KXIP, 

Daddy's Home....",8
Every team needs a Gayle. He doesn't let the game slip. He just goes BOOM.,9
I want more **GAYLE in Sharjah**!!!,6
Mandeep completed a single right there,7
"It was a good IPL lads, see you next year",9
Gayle wants to get to his 1000 career Sixes this match? 8 more to go,8
Boss for a reason,8
Mandeep sorry Gayle does not deal with quick singles,19
"Please Kumble, continue to make idiotic decisions like not playing Gayle for the first 5 matches on the trot",11
"Dismiss Gayle please, ASAP. Otherwise KXIp are on a cruise right now, running away with the game.",0
WhyRun Chakravarty,11
GAYLE RAN A TWO!!,23
Imagine how scary it must be as a spinner to bowl to gayle in this ground .,7
Lmao Mandeep trying to sneak a quick single with Gayle. What is wrong with you.,10
"Punjab looks a brand new team now.

Winning matches on demand is damn interesting too watch.",14
Gayle is absolutely bang for buck for KXIP... only if Maxwell played according to how much hes been paid,12
Gayle: **Fuck your singles**,9
Yooonivurs Baas pleej com back üò≠üò≠üò≠,2
Just found about Marlon Samuel's meltdown on Instagram. Wtf is wrong with the guy,9
Gayle flicks and jogs 2 runs..,2
"As a neutral, I used to love watching Narine bowl",4
High iq commentators: he's running between wickets so he must want runs,9
"There is no stopping the Universe Boss today. Jamaican on fire.

And lets not forget the guy is 41 years old",2
Gayle ran a 2 klaxon,2
2-3wickets in quick succession now or else KKR is done for.,2
I'm gayleosexual,6
Did they just run a 2?,1
"This was pretty much what Gayle did against DC, stabilized the RRR exactly what was required and again today",7
"As opposition, you just gotta pray that it's not Gayle's day else look forward to the next match.",7
Chris Gayle has brought about this mentality change in kings 11 mindset.,9
Gayle reached Mandeep's score already LMAO,3
didn‚Äôt the dugout guys say they were break free,2
Did I hear Mandeep say ‚Äòsorry‚Äô when he was halfway down there?,2
Played out Narine just like that,4
"With Gayle in the team, the batting line-up looks great. 

Call on Maxwell has to be taken. Guess he is still in because he can give some Overs. 

When does Mayank return?

Edit: meant when, not why",6
"There's no 2's going to be taken now, its 1, 4, 6 or dot.",6
Jesus Gayle,3
Reminder that Gayle was again unsold and bought at base price in 2018. In 2011 he was unsold and bought as a replacement.,14
Good job seeing off Narine,2
"I wanted a Gaylestorm this season , careful what you wish for  (Ôæâ¬∞_o)Ôæâ‚åí‚î´ ‚îª ‚î£ ‚î≥",5
"Gayle scored as much as Mandeep in ~40% of the balls,  I'm so happy the universe boss can still kick ass",4
Fuck Vettori for releasing Chinnaswamy legend Gayle,7
"Feel for Narine, had to change action at this age",6
Only SRH can lose from here,9
KXIP are actually gonna do it aren't they? When is Agarwal coming back?,6
"Arshdeep and Porel remained in the shadows of Mavi & Nagarkoti. The latter got to the limelight for their 150+ ability, but went too hard and injured themselves for 2 years. While Porel and Arshdeep put in the hardwork and coming off hard now. Kudos to both",11
KKR PLEASE TAKE WICKETS NOW :/,2
preity cheering the team with such enthusiasm every game year after year  has got me rooting for kxip on neutral games,14
"Can anyone tell me what's the role of Kamlesh Nagarkoti in this KKR team? If you want 2 overs only out of him, get that out of Rana just after the powerplay.",13
"Had they played Gayle earlier, KXIP would have been sitting comfortably in the points table.",7
"When Prasidth is a strike bowler for your team, then a lot is wrong for your team.",3
We are getting pummeled by Gayle and I ain't even mad,10
I smell a big dick SIX,5
Say whatever you want.. Mandeep playing sensible innings here. No need to hit when universe boss is at the other end.,18
"Lol.. Both batsman at same runs.... The difference?

One is playing at 200+ strike rate

Other is playing at <100 strike rate",7
KXIP is going to win the IPL isnt it,12
Good to see a bigger brand like Colgate sponsoring KXIP. Don‚Äôt think they were sponsoring earlier.,6
At this rate KXIP will let Gayle play until hes 50 lmao,16
"What so iconic about Gayle is that he has been playing the game forever with legends like Lara, Sarwan, and Chanderpaul. He's still here and still making an impact in the game.",37
When is mayank back ?,2
It's really difficult being a kkr fanüò≠üò≠üò≠,9
Nice shot!!!,3
has anyone shared food pictures from ipl? wonder what kind of food is available in the bubble,5
"Chris ""Universe Boss, Big Dick, Legend, Big Man, I hit sixes for fun"" Gayle",9
"Mi and dc, plz beat rcb so we can have rcb vs kxip eliminator",3
153 interesting,5
Mandeep with all his strength manages to hit a four,5
RIP KKR's campaign can't say its been great this year,3
lockie pace ferguson,1
"Punjab, it's time for y'all to choke. Please and thank you",3
I don't think 39(39) is a bad innings in a chase of 150 on a slow wicket when you have big hitters like Gayle and Pooran,24
Lockie Ferguson clocking 153km/h!!!!,9
Let mandeep get 50 let mandeep get 50 let mandeep get 50,8
Yo! Calm down Mandeep!,1
Ferguson's bowling at some speed right now,5
"F1 Fam, Is Chris Gayle an equivalent of Kimi Raikonnen?",5
Lockie looks like he's in the mood to rip someone's head off,3
"Kkr really have failed upwards this ipl, I'm genuinely surprised they're 4th, kxip and rr both look like stronger teams",8
ooooh Lockie's Pissed!,2
"Punjab, rcb and dc.. finals between any of these teams and I‚Äôll be damn happy",3
Now Lockie isn't taking wickets too. KKR :(,3
Ferguson is giving his 100% even if he isn‚Äôt doing well. Love to see it,7
"Gayle - 34 (16)

Mandeep - 34 (37)


KXIP: 96/1, after 13 overs.

Imagine playing half of your team's overs and not even made half the contribution when it comes to runs. As an opener.

Bad decision to not open with Gayle. The guy can cause havoc in PP.",-9
Still i am not relaxed even when the team is in such a comfortable position.,3
Bangar the dugout guru???,7
"I miss Gayle at RCB so much and can‚Äôt forgive the management for releasing him :,(

Sure, he did not bat so well and had injuries for a season. If we have been so persistent with Finch, we could have been more persistent with Gayle.",17
Karthik resigned for this?,4
KXIP don‚Äôt screw this up,5
Reminder than we lost by 59 runs to this team,5
Brett lee went for the high five and Sanjay went for the fist bumpüò≠,9

*RUNS RUNS RUNS*,2
"I still beleive in our team 

We gon take this one too to the last over.",4
What a damn shot!!! Classy.,9
Stop blaming Mandeep y'all his dad just passed away. It's hard for him even playing this match,21
Mandeep you genius !,14
"Lmao Bangar fist bumped Brett Lee's hi-five

Just Sanjay Bangar being himself",3
punjab is CRUISIN through this one,2
"Wow, Mandy. What a shot.",7

I just wanna see KXIP finish this match before the last over.. possibly before 18th over to get their NRR up and to not have a thriller match for once.,8
Mandeep strike rate >100 hype,6
KL was so excited to be back in the test side that he actually played a test knock.,-1
Gayle RAN 2,11
"Honestly Mandeep deserves a different team, is too good to be a backup opener",1
Gayle puts more energy in running 2s than hitting sixes,9
I clap harder when bossman runs two üòÇ what a fighter,9
Gayle why u run 2süò∞,5
Kings XI no last over chase please..,3
"Are they chanting ""Ben Stokes"" in stadium? What is that song",1
Why's Gayle running 2?,2
"Mandeep, you gotta go 50 now, cant get out now",4
Woo Gayle with those 2's,5
WTF gayle pushing for 2 runs... what alternate universe is this.,5
"Mandeep made Gayle sprint for a 2


Surely all the hate stops here? Even Jesus wouldn't be able to do that",20
If Gayle didn't change his direction there DK ded,9
What happens if the bowler bowls 2 balls above shoulder height? Does the bowler get taken off or is it a no ball?,2
[deleted],9
Lmao imagine being DK... You see Gayle charging towards you and you can't move aside. I would just pray and hope he changes his course lmao,13
[deleted],8
Tripathi is amazing in the field,9
You know it's desperate stuff when Gayle starts running 2s,7
"Y'all need to stop Mandeep Singh bashing. Yes he's a tad slow but it's important to not lose wickets here. We saw what happened with KKR. His SR is also being affected by the fact that they can't run quick singles and doubles with Gayle. Plus with Gayle striking the way he is, there's no need for Mandeep to take unnecessary risks. And finally, he's catching up.",10
Wow what a rare sight. Gayle is actually running,6
"KKR and SRH fans: *It's really hard being a KKR/SRH fan*

Punjab and Delhi fans: *~~Bitch~~Behenchod please*",19
Gayle showing intent by ~~hitting sixes~~ running two's,8

good night guyz.",9
37 off the last 5,2
Inb4 Mandeep gets teary eyed after getting 50,0
What is the point of having kamlesh nagarkoti and not using him when your side is prone to batting collapses,3
Time to switch gear rather than playing till last over and making it close.,5
Reminder that Dhoni is considered a legend when we actually have 3x the player in Gayle.,10
"How the hell do you not play Gayle right from the start?

The team has looked completely different since he came back into the side",5
Gayle isn't gonna go easy on Prasidh. Tushar 2.0,6
"If one needs 2 runs to win of last ball, 1 touches inside and runs on the pitch, will that be considered illegal ?",2
"Seriously what was the point of having Nagarkoti if he hasn't even bowled yet. It makes no sense to give him a spot just to get 1-2 overs off him. They could have played Siddesh Lad and extended that batting lineup, or even Kuldeep to get that extra spinner.",8
[deleted],4
Just straight up tell which team would be out of the tournament if they lose the next game? (Except CSK),1
Who has the record for most deliveries faced in IPL without scoring a 2?,1
"During a match ,we all have a Lenskart Amit mishra inside of us",4

Gayle running for twos. _happy bumro noises._,4

"Why are they shouting BC , BC?",0
"KKR literally had no plans on how to win this game, Narine overs ended like a flash",3
Come on bois finish this off quickly and boost NRR,4
[deleted],-5
nagarkoti was played as a batsman,7
Choke please choke,-3
Jesus Gayle sprinting for twos I have seen it all,5
That 6(13) may look harmless but was a catalyst for putting pressure on Gill and then subsequently Cummins also.        KKR are cutting off their 2 legs and then expect to win a 100 metre race,5
I totally forgot Sanju was in DD,5
Nagarkoti didn't bowl !,2
"When Gayle starts running 2s, he is playing with the intent which means the opposition is gonna lose.",13
Mandy do a Pandey thankq,-1
Mandeep is brilliant at finding the gaps,4
"Yep confirm

We're taking it to the deep here.",5
when Mayank returns kxip drops hooda for him and Mandeep bats 6 we reckon?,2
Nagarkoti the specialist googly tackler,7
Tata should give an Altroz to Swann. He may be going on and on about it due to his sarcastic nature but the sheer volume of it has to go down as successful advertising.,9
 A rr fan just wants kxip to win but not comfortably but bsdk korbo lorbo gand marwabo gang won't let us have that,8

"So, after KKR's defeat tonight what are the playoff scenarios?",6
if punjab win they in top 4?,3
"50(49) ain't gonna work in playoffs, if ur opposition is MI",2

Imagine 2020 RCB with Gayle over Finch,13
"Dedicating it to his dad, that's beautiful.",13
Good on you mandeep.. and RIP Sr Singh.. what an emotional knock this must be for him.. get KXIP over the line now m8!!!,11

Power to you Mandeep.. playing so well after a huge personal loss.,11
Lmao my entire family sang the bappi lahiri cred ad together in the 1st innings,7
Never seen Gayle run so much.. boss knows it's an important match,11
Punjab turning the IPL more than the bat in Mandeep's hand,10
KKR are playing too many bowler. 5 main bowlers and an all rounder in Narine who's anyway going to ball 4 overs,6
"Yeah sure Praisdh, go on sledge Gayle

What could go wrong",30
Mandeep with great mental strength,19
Well played Mandeep.,18

Isn't Gayle the perfect father figure for any youngster in the team? He just has this lovable character can't hate the man,32

"This is what Mandeep has been doing brilliantly for a long time for any team he plays in

Consistent, 130 s/r (had a tough first 11 balls when he scored 3) finding the gaps with boundaries and not relying on power

Makes him a better ODI player than a test player but he knows that and keeps doing amazing every single year both in Ranji and SMAT while leading a very young Punjab squad",15
Maxi seems really hungry and determined now . He feels he owes this team something and is being an absolute team man,15
Well played Mandeep Singh. A great display of mental strength,8
"Proud of ma boy, now KXIP can choke",9
Imagine doubting a legend like Kumble.,10
OOTL with Mandeep. Can someone tell me about it?,3
The real question is how can Kings XI make things difficult from here?,5
SHOT MANDY,8
"Man these T20 anchors are all the same aren't they. Play slowly at first,  get people to shit at you.... start hitting boundaries as the target approaches and have people appreciating you",11
I think KKR should try Siddish Lad for prasidh to make their batting strong,3
Just don't take the match to final over. It makes good batsman do stupid things,4
27 off 24. KXIP fans are more nervous than KKR Lmao,19
[deleted],9
"Low sr for mandeep, but he never really needed to accelerate, asking rate was always under control.",7
Love how Gayle hits sem sixes without taking risks !,6
"Looking at Mandeep bat is a reminder to all of us that it is the immense desire to do well that can push us to perform better than normal. 

If a person really decides to do something..they can exceed their own expectations..",8
punjab knocking out mi in the eliminator will be some stuff,12
Why pick nagarkoti if you're not Bowling him.smh,10
Please KXIP don't choke..,12
Is Nagarkoti playing as a specialist batsman?,10
KXIP is slapping everyone and I am loving it lol.,3
"r/KXIP started with 83, now has 178 members",4
For a moment I thought Narine left with 2,2
Prasaadh Krishna,3
"Need Lockie Special, now!!!!",1
Shami looks so pissed in that ad,3
‚Äúgayle struggles with short balls‚Äù not in sharjah fam,3

Thr tournament has come alive in the last week.,3
"RCB released KL, Mandeep, Gayle, Mayank lmao.. basically our entire top order is Ex-RCB.",13
Gaylestorm :( :(,2
Smol ground OP,3
Short pitch with no third man,4
Kxip been doing a Tewatia all along,10
"This is an excellent innings from Mandeep.

He's been such a good player over the years for KXIP. He was Valthaty's Replacement in 2012 scoring over 400+ runs. Became the main KXIP opener in 2013 cos Gilly was dropped due to poor form. Didn't break in during that dream 2014 season due to Sehwag,Saha and Vohra. Then stuck in an RCB middle order for 4 years until coming back to KXIP. Strong heart to play like this under pressure and even stronger considering the tragedy he faced 2 days ago.

More power to you, Mandeep!",16
"Guys, what happened to Mandeep there? I stopped watching it for a while.",3
Run a ball now!,3
Not Ferguson's day,4
He shat on that on the body bouncer.,4
That brings Gayle to 43 .. wow that was quick,3
Fucking bossss!!!,3
Lol,3
"Guys we misread Nagarkoti, he's a specialised batsman now",8
Christopher Henry I love you.,5
Jesus man.... Gayle should definately open in the pp,10
"Fuck, what a shot!!",4
F for Ferguson,7
"Chris Gayle is a cyborg, confirmed.",7
YES GAYLE GO ON GAYLE,5
Stand and deliver,4
Nagarkoti and Cummins scored 7(21) combined,7
What a gangsta this guy is. Absolutely zero fucks to give,5
Lmao this is a boss six,3
Rahul and Kimble hugging Mandeep,4
We are winning without any hiccups. This team is improving day by day.,8
Yas Gayle cunt him,7
Gayle was tired of Mandeep making him run,11
I love you so much Gayle. Hopefully we win the IPL for you,9
Another C R U N C H ! ! !,4
"oh man, Gayle is the T20 GOAT, no doubt about it",10
GAYLEFORCE,8
Universe Boss still got it,7
I love Gayle,5
"Enter cheat code: ""G A Y L E""",7
"A man who fucks another man = Gay
A man who fucks 11 men = Gayle",7
Not me thinking we're still going to face last 3 balls,8
"Jordan performed ‚úÖ

KXIP look comfortable ‚úÖ

Morgan performed ‚úÖ

Today was a good day.",14
I really hope KXIP doesn't make it to the playoffs. If they do everyone is fucked,9
Gayle must be a living embodiment of Sir Viv Richards,8
"DC fans must be so happy, they've been crap for the second half of the season and this KKR setback almost guarantees them a top 4 finish.",9
Man kkr is shit at field placement,7
I won't tell my son about Chris Gayle... because he'll be watching him live and see for himself what a monster he is.,7
Imagine having fucking Gayle in your squad and not playing him every game.,10
Gayle I can't remember if he failed even once this ipl,14
I think the fault is SRH‚Äôs. We gave KKR the hope that this bowling line up is really strong.,16
This is why you always play the Universe Boss.,19
"Sluggish start and then suddenly getting in top gear was the reason I started supporting MI 
 
KXIP exactly playing like that this season",7
Could have had Rinku Singh instead of Nagarkoti.,10
DK secretly wanted Gayle to get that 50 lol,13
Count players with your fingers who can hit a bowler like Ferguson like that....Fire !,17
We are going to champagneship,7
Chris Gayle followed a completely different trajectory to his 50 lol,21
The boss!,7
Gayle on song is so great to see.,5
Inb4 Gayle run out and KXIP takes it to the superover and win this match,6
boss üòé,7
Oh Dadddy Universe Boss Love Machine ‚ù§Ô∏è üí¶üí¶ *slurp *slurp *slurp,11
Anymore matches for KXIP in Sharjah?,6
Punjab are gonna win the whole thing with the Gayle momentum aren't they?,10
Ready glad for Mandeep.,4
I take heart in the fact that we are loosing to a much better team. Kkr is just not there and in no way deserves the playoff spot in place of KXIP. We need to fix our shit real soon.,5
"Thanks for not opening with Gayle KXIP ,spared us a big humiliation here",10
I like to think Gayle will never retire and just keep on going,9
"Gayle, we know you are the universe boss but please give some twist to the plot.",4
"If Punjab gets into playoffs, they‚Äôll be a force to reckon. Their bowlers & Rahul were always good but their other batsmen are getting more & more consistent. Imagine Maxwell also finding batting form before the playoffs.",9
"LMAOOO putting ""The Boss"" the right way hahahaha whadda playa",24
Love you Gayle,9
KXIP winning 5 matches in a row.,7
"Gayle is 41, playing like 21.",17
I hope they finish off this game in next 6 balls.,9
Gayle is paying Punjab 10 folds for believing in him!,16
"This Gayle kid can bat, is he in the Windies team?",16
Gayles going to be smacking 6s in franchise cricket into his 50s isn't he? He doesn't run normally anyway.,9
Has Gayle lost some weight? He looks skinnier,3
"Chris Gayle...What a character.

Gets his celebration right this time.Absolute legend !",6
Gayle Storm Dudes.,2
Thought gayle was wearing braces for a hot second,2
RCB wants Finch to do what Gayle is doing lol,17
is nagarkoti playing solely for his fielding? Did Morgan just forget that he is in the team today?,4
Footbatall,3
Priety is such a snaccccc,7
Atleast KKR won't have to play in Sharjah anymore :'),8
Looks like Gayle has found the English medicine of hitting form at the end of the career.,2
"Gayle may have done wonders for KXIP but he has taken away the choker meme team I loved and I will not forgive him for this.    


Massive /s",9
"KXIP: Started from the bottom, now we're here.",4
"I remember when Gayle smashed Bopara for 5 sixes while he was at KKR 

Then KKR proceeded to release him. Lmao",8
"If Gayle was healthy from game 1, Punjab would've already been a lock for playoffs

once Mayank is back... man this team is scary",8
"How can Preity Zinta maintain that shape at that age ? Surgeons, exercise, diet or magic. Guess Gene's matter.",5
That was the craziest leg bye by far,4
Haha knees one to third man.,5
Oo Kxip don't choke. It's not finished till its finished.,3
"You know who really deserves a yooogee apology thread. KXIP team & KL. This kind of comeback is unheard of. IPL is a pretty long tournament and it is much better to peak at a later stage than blow hot at the beginning & lose steam later.

On the other hand, Kumble & KXIP management owe a big apology to the Universe Boss. What were they smoking?",28
Gayle gonna play till he hits half century in real life too. Boss,12
"Opposition takes a wicket.

KXIP: LoL",14
"I watch KXIP's matches for nostalgic feels. ü•∫

*#RCBFan*",1
"Cheeky back of the bat uppercut, you love to see it",5
King of cool,5
"Gayle is the only player who can get away with calling himself universe boss. I mean, can we ever refute this?",20
Scenes if Gayle had kicked that for Six,4
Gayle is such a calming presence in the team.,3
Gayle will be a millionaire again in the next auction,10
"KXIP literally with ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù after DC fucked up against KKR this weekend!",16
At this rate I wouldn‚Äôt mind switching teams to support KXIP,6
KKR finally getting asked to vacate its ancestral home of 4th position,10
"KKR batting is pure, unadulterated shit and their bowling needs bigger stadiums to put pressure and squeeze the opposition. Not surprising we have lost all matches in Sharjah.",4
I was promised a choke. Where is The Choke??,3
Suddenly we see teams chasing are starting to win,1
"Mandeep scores 50:   *This one sparks tears*



Gayle scores 50:   *This one sparks joy*



MS scores 50:   *This one sparks*",18
"KKR is basically done for this IPL. To qualify now, they basically have to win their remaining 2 games and hope that kxip loses 1. If KKR loses even 1 game, then kxip has to lose both their remaining games. This honestly doesn't look very good for KKR.",12
"Imagine if KXIP wins this, wins the next, loses to CSK in the last game and thus gets knocked out.",8
"Even in the years gayle performed badly for rcb (2016, 2017) he was still better than finch. Dafuq are we doing persisting with finch.",3
"If this was the 2000s, I would request the umpires to check for a spring in the bat of Gayle",3
No ovr from nagarkoti....poor captaincy from Morgan. Why they took him in the team?,4
"This is a turnaround of epic proportions, KXIP",5
"Gayle using his pad as a bat, lmao",6
How are CSK not at the bottom of the fair play award is beyond me.,10
"RCB once had Gayle, ABD and Kohli. But, we shall never forget that we won most of the matches only because of the Universe Boss!!",8
What a yorker.,2
"Why Nagarkoti not bowling, batting higher than Cummins?       KKR Management- MaTcHuPs",11
"Thought there was going to be a game here, then Gayle rolled in and the result was inevitable.",9
"KKR don't deserve a playoff chance. They don't have a consistent batting order. It's okay to experiment but except Gill, no batsman ever played in same position. They pick bowlers whom they don't even bowl. they're as bad as us this season and they were lucky to win couple of close games which they shouldn't have won.",16
Always bet on Gayle. Who needs to run if you can hit 2 sixes in an over at will,11
Let's not forget Gayle would have played 2 match earlier if he didn't get food poisoning. Kohli fans hell bent on blaming kumble on this sub,10
Love how KXIP and RR have kept life in tournament even in the fag end.,9
"I am no clue how we are first at Fair play award, especially after Krunal's tantrums",20
"Punjab can win this in 18th over, i have seen this before",15
Gayle adjusting to a different batting position after opening his entire career at the age of 41 is next level.,16
[deleted],6
"Poor Bangar, they picked such a shitty pic",6
Don‚Äôt take it to the last ball bruh,11
"The best battle of this season without a shadow of a doubt has been

**Kumble vs Kohli**

It‚Äôs too close to call even now!",12
KL Rahul is definitely captaincy material,20
"C.Gayle was unsold in 2-rounds during last auction

IPL management or any franchise should have him in IPL in any role.

Whenever he retires...",34
Just freaking finish off the game already,4
That looked rapid af,6
"Glad we r back to bat first and lose, I was really missing some quality chases",5
That hug was the most wholesome thing I've seen in the last couple of matches.,12
"KKR deserve this for having DK. Overhyped, Overpaid and absolute dogshit player. When was the last time this clown had a positive impact on a game ?",5
That seemed high,11
KL supporting Mandy is wholesome. He is a good friend and good leader.,21
Beautiful shots by Mandeep over mid wicket and covers for 4,7
"Our bowling hasn't been that great here either  juat picked up the one wicket , should have at least got one more",9
Super Over?,2
The amount of ü§° I've seen in this match thread today have been at an all time high today,9
Surely CSK to buy Gayle next auction?,16
How was that not a wide,9
The hell did he managed to hit that for six?!?,10
Non-choke kxip is here bitches!,17
KKR has a toxic relationship with Sharjah. They play totally shit in Sharjah everytime.,7
I am not surprised with KXIP slapping everyone. They were just not closing out games which is easier to fix than the whole team being wrecked like CSK.,15
Mandeep üñ§üëçüèæ,9
Nagarkoti in the team as specialist No 7 batsman,6
Big Daddy should finish it with a SIX,7
Need to win tomorrow. Seems like we haven't won for a long time.,4
Maiden 19th over and it's interesting like every other Punjab match.,2
Feels good to be on my high horse seeing so many clowns silenced in the match thread tbvh,10
"Punjab not taking chase till last over 

r/cricket: impossible",6
Shot boi,1
Mandeep Singh to this sub: Talk nah,11
This is class from KXIP. When they felt pressure Mandeep hits a boundary and when Mandeep felt pressure Gayle hits boundary.,14
That was as high as Marlon Samuels,6
Mandeep trying to steal man of the match from Gayle!,5
DC gotta win tomorrow keep SRH out,2
What's wrong with KKR!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!,2
"CSK would be greatly benefitted with Tom Banton, he is being wasted in KKR",2
I commented during the DC match that this would be the only time Cummins will perform. And here we are in the very next game.,3
"Kanos in for bairstow plz

If fit",2
"Gayle has been the **spark** that KXIP needed. Now if they only foster their batting and drop Maxi, they'll be a force to reckon.",5
Gayle is MotM for me even if Mandeep ends up with more runs - he turned the game around. Can't believe his power even at 40+ years of age.,8
Captain Punjab finshing it for kings xi Punjab,2
"Mandeep Singh : ""Yeah r/cricket, talk nah""",8
"How the fuck did ashwin decode Gayle? Truly an ethical mind

On another hand he gets fucked by Narine",16
Mandeeep singh üòç,5
Lmfao wtf Gayle,4
"aww, wanted him to win it",4
"Finally RCB gets a half decent bowling unit, but no batsmen like KL, Gayle, Mandeep in the team any longer",4
"An excellent 100 run partnership in 10.1 overs, Mandeep and Gayle have great chemistry together",5
Still an easy win lads come on,3
Bruhhhhhhhhh,5
KXIP won ever match after Gayle's return.... lucky charm ü•∞üòç,7
"Right chaps, run an over and then stay cool in the super over",7
This year's KXIP remind me of Mumbai Indians of 2014 & 2015.. lose most of the matches in the first half and then go on an impeding rampage in the second half to qualify for the playoffs..,7
I thought that would‚Äôve gone for six by fluke,2
anti-climatic why u do this dadddyüò≠,4
Damn it,3
"So Mandeep, Arshdeep and Harpreet have made a group in KXIP,  called Japps. Gayle is the core member now and Burrraaahhh is their trademark step.",7
Twist??,3
"it's a bit late but it's here as promised, it's the  C O L L A P S E",1
Oh no.... anyway,16
That's the slowest bouncer,6
"Good show Punjab.  


I for one didn't see this coming after them being rock bottom around the half way stage. If they can make it to the top 4, then I'd have to say they'd be the form team and the dark horses. Mumbai being the odds on favourites for sure.",14
Collapse time,7
Gonna choke when 3 runs of 2 overs required lol,7
Pooran gonna come and slap the ball and call it a game,9
Collapse?,10
Still beats me why Morgan didn't bring Lockie on when Gayle first came to the crease.,1
kxip doing kxip things,5
All aboard the Moral Victory train !!!!!!!!,2
Wil KXIP tank?,3
Kl Rahul has improved his captaincy too in the past few games along with his batting and keeping Kudos to him.,3
Makes you wonder why it took KXIP to get almost knocked out until they gave Gayle a chance,6
Gayle is kinda cute,5
6 wickets in this over and we're game,14
Mayank for Hooda....and no one dare touch this KXIP. Also kxip is Best death bowling side now?,6
Can kxip still bottle it. Let's see,13
Super over incoming?,3
Is this what KXIP are going to do to make it interesting or are they now at a KXIP-proof point?,7
Send Pooran to finish it with a six.,13
"Lol looks like DC and RCB will be looking to scamper to top 2 positions. 

MI and KXIP are looking too strong to face twice",6
"**18.1** Ferguson to Gayle, OUT,  **147-2**

CH Gayle c Prasidh Krishna b Ferguson 51 (29b 2x4 5x6) SR: 175.86",1
Pooran to come and hit boundary to finish,3
Of course Gayle had to go. Things don't happen straightforwardly for Punjab,7
"Can't even imagine us in this position without the universe bosss 

We owe everything to Chris gayle üíì",18
Gayle gets out when match is won for his team. Dhoni gets out after making sure game is lost for his team.,10
*KL*apse?,3
"For any other team that would be a 'Oh no! Anyway...' moment

But cause of KXIP's record this season I'm genuinely worried",10
he is never good at finishing it,1
My dream batting pair next season: Chris Gayle and kedar jadhav.,3
3 runs is childs play. lets get this over with,2
"Kumble don't deserve the criticism he got during the starting phase. Considering this is the first time with kxip, it might take a while for people to adjust etc but people were shitting on him for every messed up thing kxip did. Yes some of it is on him but you can't fucking blame him for everything. Few people even questioned what did he achieve as a player forget coach. I mean that dude right now is in the third in the list of all time wicket takers in tests FFS",8
They should've bowled short balls to Chris Gayle much earlier seeing that he struggles a bit against that.,2
The commentator jinxed it.,2
Even we can't bottle from here ü§£,3
KKR's playoffs dreams are in jeopardy.,4
What is the highest winning streak a team has had in the ipl?,2
"Gayle has achieved everything there is in cricket tbh

He's just playing for fun at this point, hope he continues for 10 more years",8
Choke????,4
"3 runs needed to win, fuck it and let's take it to a super over!",3
Inb4 six wickets in this over,5
Watch pooran smack it for a six,5
Shit I forgot about pooran,5
WICKET!!!! Can they CHOKE now?!!!! NOT!!!! KXIP for the win!!,8
cmon JUST RUN THE DAMN 3,7
"Just now, MI posted a pic of Rohit with caption ""Just what we love to see! Hitman in action at today's training"" what's going on!!!",15
Imagine what Nagarkoti is thinking ....,16
sUpeRovEr aNyoNe?,8

Don‚Äôt take it to the last over boys,8
Thanks KKR for keeping their NRR in check,9

*Out comes Pooran*

KXIP: LoL",20
Nagarkoti hasn't even bowled one ball today.,14
1 run away from Super over Lmfao,7
He really is boss of cricket universe,8
But why did Gill deny the single to Fergy?!?,7
I want all the cred ad actors and singers to come together to make one final hell of an advertisement .,13
Pooran needs to sort his calls for runs,10
"Backing MI to win this IPL.

They just know how to win lmao.",4

KXIP won't choke. Double super over win gave them confidence that they won't get bogged down by pressure if they play their natural game.,9

"Both these teams have some really good Indian uncapped talent. KXIP were underutilising them but they have given opportunities to Arshdeep and Mandeep in the past few games. KKR are still wasting them by continuously playing with the roles of Krishna, Tripathi, Rana, Nagarkoti and Mavi. Also, they have ruined Kuldeep.",8
Winner winner chicken dinner,3
KKR overthrowing making sure it doesn't go into super over,4
1 of 3 > 1 of 8,3
Lmao Pooran,6
For some reason my fear of punjab losing increases the more their req run rate decreases this season,11
"*Scores level*


Me: Can I haz superover^^TM ??",7
I'm truly confused about the Nagarkoti situation... KKR outdoing themselves once again.,2
How the fuck does Pooran always get in these situations while running?,5
Pooran always trying to run partner out,14
BYEEEEE KKRRRRR.....,0

Lol leaving strike bowlers too late in game is our speciality. Don‚Äôt even try to compete with Iyer genius.,7

Take a bow guys. A 41 year old Chris Gayle shows that he has still got it.,13
Great win. 5 in a row now,5

If cricket was an Anime Chris Gayle would be that badass old guy who rarely comes to a fight but when he does he whoops some serious ass,56

KXIP without Gayle: 1 out of 7 wins

With Gayle: 5 out of 5 wins",44
Well played boys. Back to the well deserved top four.,20
Gill and Mandeep probably conversing in Punjabi..... wholesome,25
DKüò°,6
Thought the match would get over before 15 overs. Well played.,12
"Mf scriptwriters didnt even put a twist, why even watch Ipl",14
Please tell me KXIP is now No.4,20
"ok, now RR or CSK, beat both of these teams please and I‚Äôll love you forever

Sincerely, an SRH fan",10
Chokers choking every other team right now !,15
This KXIP gonna kill in the eliminator,11
"Excellent innings from Mandeep and Gayle. Both were equally important with their roles. Top performance by Bishnoi as well. Who's MotM? I vote for Gayle, since he turned the game.",7
"not even mad if KXIP go to the playoffs, they deserve it. congratulations I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall ü•∫",17
Finally an unfamiliar word for KXIP‚Äôs performance: Clinical,19
KKR hit by a Gayle....well played Boss and his team!!,15
And just like that KXIP have won half their games.,19
Losing this game to a direct playoff competitor can be really damaging to KKR's Playoffs aspirations if we are also considering NRR as a factor.,12
KXIP have been the best team in the tournament. If we get top 4 we winning it all.,12
KKR does not have any day games left. KXIP qualifying,18
"If dc screws up, punjab my 2nd choice. Amazing season comeback, also preity zinta ‚ù§Ô∏è",19
Works well for Maxwell since he did not have to bat this match!,22
"Two weeks ago, 4th place looked like a distant dream. But here we are. Whoppie!",30
Winning is a habit.,24
From bottom of the table to top 4! Kumble has done it again.,45
Punjab deserves playoffs far more than Kolkata. Saying this as a KKR fan.,20
"I think kxip are gonna lose in the final

Scriptwriter gonna end this in a tragedy won't he",25
KXIP doing a Mumbai 2015,18
5 in a row boys and I'm not talking about losing,50
Preity is such a good owner of the team. Doesn't matter if the team is hot or cold. She will always be there through the thicks and the thins. Have to give her that ! Should be a huge confidence boost to the players as well.,37
[deleted],40
"Mandeep played sensibly and beautifully, but I think MOTM should go to Gayle today.",16
"KKR have found ways to mess up their team, concentrating too much on matchups. Not bowling Nagarkoti, sending him higher than Cummins. Everything has been them overcomplicating. They have just won 1 game convincingly, absolutely no surprises it was against us.",19
Pls interview Gayle,10
"Nice to see the comradeship, but it's still a pandemic.. also to you in the stands Preity Zinta",14
"Both kkr and punjab play the same exact teams of CSK and RR. Yeah, were fucked lol",8
Man I bloody love Punjab. So much little to not like about them. I'd be absolutely rooting for them if Delhi were to get knocked out at any stage. ‚ù§Ô∏è,38
"With Gayle: 5 out of 5 wins

KXIP without Gayle: 1 out of 7 wins",27
"Punjab's last 2 games are Rajasthan and CSK. As long as we have no more Stokes heroics, Punjab should add 4 more points pretty comfortably.",19
say what you want but Mandeep not collapsing at the beginning really helped us move forward,24
I hope CSK don't stop the Punjab train in their last match! Imagine Dhoni taking CSK to a last ball win and eliminating KXIP :(,23

This why players like Gayle are so important! they will win matches for you or even if they have bad day they won't waste many deliveries!,29
They year when CSK is out and everyone else is in the hunt.,16
How do I change my flair to KXIP from shitty SRH ?,11
 KKR looks so clueless without Gambhir!,16
2016 RCB intensities.,18
Kxip will keep on saying that they will loose so that they win. 3D chess move,12
Why bowl Ferguson last in an easy chase? Morgan's captaincy has been overrated so far in the tournament.,13
"I just want Kxip vs Dc final. Is that too much to ask for? :""(",17
Rumor has it Morgan has still not found Nagarkoti,37
"Chris Gayle the MOTM for me.

It could have been tricky with KL gone & Mandeep with below average SR at the time. Took some balls & played like he has played for nearly two decades. 

Mandeep was the pivot but Chris was the one who boosted their innings. Universe Boss for a reason.",30
So Nagarkoti was a specialist batsman,23
Punjab. Wow.,11
And RCB decided to let go of Gayle smh,18
Looks like SRH plays the real NRR game without even realising it. Almost bottom placed but still positive nrr,10
"Off topic- Kl has been announced for the border gavaskar trophy, I'm glad he's back to test cricket because he's been a different batsman since after wc 2019, as he's found his mojo, I hope he does well,  and siraj has been announced for the tests as well he is a proper test bowler and his fc career is remarkable so hopefully he finds timber",10
5D chess from KXIP by making sure Maxwell doesn't come to bat,11
having only 4 teams in the playoffs seems a bit unfair. Every team deserves to make it except CSK,1
Want to meet the people who were behind DK's blood,8
Huuuuuge respect for Mandeep,13
"You bowl Ferg last, you don't bowl Nagarkoti at all. Eoin still has to learn a lot as captain. He should learn something from DK.",17
Gayle is such a special player... brings a really calming presence in the field,15
So proud of this man,11
"I am glad. In the end, a good team deserves to be up there. In the end, whoever gets hold of their shit on right time is a deserving side.",8
"So no Apology thread today for anyone?!?

Finally !!!",6
I want Good Guy CSK to defeat KKR and make a easy  way for KXIP ü§ó,19
"What was Nagarkoti doing in this playing 11, if he wasn't going to bowl?",15
Mannequin Neesham can look on as Gayle saves his team again.,11
Into the top 4! Comprehensive win by Kings XI. Much deserved. What a turnaround this is becoming. The grind continues to seal that playoff spot. Carry on lads. Five on the trot. Lets go!,4
KL has been an amazing and supportive captain,13
Wtf are KKR doing with 5 bowlers and a all-rounder that's gonna bowl all 4 overs,7
Morgan thought Nagarkoti was their hotel's address,18
So RCB vs KXIP final is destined for 2020. Only thing I'm loving about this year,17
"We were 1 win out of 7 btw

We should've been at 9 wins and 3 defeats

But it's okay, we got this",21
"Kxip fans:




Simp for Maxwell or



Simp for Preity?",12
Sanga looks tired,3
"Playoffs Prediction 
Qualifier 1: MI vs DC
Eliminator: RCB vs KXIP",11
"So as an RR supporter I must pray for CSK and RR to win 2 in 2 against KKR and Punjab. 
Also for SRH to get cunted by one of the top three.
Cool cool cool cool...",10
"Really hope finals is between two of DC, RCB and KXIP. We need new champs.",12
Really wish Gayle didn't get out then we would have taken 9 wickets and won by 9 wickets,9
I am glad that KXIP won. So many tough losses they should have won and they kept out Gayle way too long. Also M Ashwin was dropped too soon. Now they are playing their best team and all of them are chipping in. If they win the final 2 matches I will put them among favorites considering how many matchwinners they have plus the momentum.,21
The top 4 now are the ones that deserve the top 4 spot. Rest most have been hot or cold.,17
Hey bois we coming back tomorrow. Hope DC go easy on us.,12
So this is the most competitive IPL ever?,17
Preity in a pony tail is dreamy. What a lovely lady. ‚ù§Ô∏è,21
There is a wild possibility that 5 teams can get 8 or more wins this season!,5
"If we don't make it, I'm on the KXIP train. I can't stand the thought of any of the other teams winning",18
Is Gayle MotM?,6
"Kxip can be MI of 2015, could even sneak in to top 2 with 16 pts , currently top teams MI , DC , RCB will play against each other so 2 of them may drop points",14
"KL has been brilliant as a captain. Not changing plans after getting hit for 1 six, knowing which bowler to use, backing his batsmen well, leading from the front with his batting. Our best since Bailey",30
Feel a bit bad for Ferguson. Should have been brought earlier instead of the end when the momentum was already set,12
"Stop calling him Chris Gayle ffs

He is Universeboss !",29
I like how much Gayle enjoys getting the 1 lakh,23
What are the scenarios to ensure Kings XI seal a playoff spot?,11
"Thanks to RCB, KXIP has a good run rate. So even if teams get tied for the 4th place they're still going through.",23
Man KXIP are pulling a realy good comeback.,17
"If KKR does not make it to the play-offs, I am going to support KXIP just because of Gayle! He's 41 and hitting like this!
I don't think the world has ever seen a player like him and will any one like him ever again! Respect!",16
I thought KL was sad when they were losing. Now realising that's how his face is!,51
"KL Rahul, the type of person, to write 2 pages answer for a 1 mark question",50
"‚ÄúKL you must be a happy man?‚Äù

‚Äú üòêOh yeah I am üòê‚Äú",57
Mandeep just demoted Gayle to world boss.,24
KL Rahul: yeah I mean....,23
KL having a hard time not feeling emotional,23
I'm sure Gayle is very proud of that award. It's going to be the centerpiece in his trophy cabinet.,29
BENCHOD!!!!!!,8
"""the last time Bigg Boss came in""

Chris Gayle to guest star on Bigg Boss confirmed",18
YAAASSS GAYLE MOTM,17
Why is no one criticizing Morgan now.,16
I'm so glad KXIP doesn't have Koach's chaotic energy when we are on a roll and instead have Rahul's calma calma energy,50
"If RCB don‚Äôt win, I‚Äôm really hoping Punjab does. RCB greats present in the team and the legend Gayle deserves a IPL.",35
Unacademy cred tata altroz and every other sponsor moment of the match should be Gayle running multiple twos in one match,30
Lol Gayle. What a guy,25
[deleted],25
Such a great guy. Truly Universe boss.,16
Chris Gayle is one heck of an interview,26
Having a huge dressing room character is so underrated in this sport. Chris Gayle is definitely one of a kind.,34
"Chris, never retire. I'm 30 and when I grow up I want to be just like Gayle",39
Gayle is the George Foreman of cricket,14
Universe Boss just bossed that interview and smashed it for six!,18
"Irrespective of their flairs, everyone here collectively cheers for KXIP and that's wholesome.  :)",46
Such a joy to watch Gayle both on and off the field. He's still got the touch even at 41.,24
Was there ever a season when the top 4 were sort of decided well in advance?,3
"Can someone explain cricket jersey numbers?

333 for Gayle , 69 for Lockie ..",17
"Chris Gayle - Zlatan Ibrahimovic 
.
.
.

*spiderman pointing towards each other meme*",31
Class is class. Respect the fucking universe boss,30
I'm scared to get ahead of myself just in case i jinx the team. Hopefully Waheguru helps us qualify.,31
Heartbreaking as a KKR fan :( Tough road ahead of us :/,9
KXIP doing a MI this season.,8
"At least KKR's matches at Sharjah are over, and next 2 matches are at Dubai - where they dominated in their only match they played. Still fingers crossed and hope for the best.",1
First Stokes now warner,1
